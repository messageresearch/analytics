[25:54] appreciate I was really thinking about
[25:57] everyone
[25:58] on my trip and and want to get back home
[26:01] and and when you when you're away from
[26:04] our
[26:05] family boy I'll tell you you don't know
[26:08] how much strength that we draw from each
[26:10] other I just I was thinking about you
[26:13] all all the time and I was thinking
[26:16] about just the church and how the Lord
[26:18] has blessed us and as I I said in my
[26:21] WhatsApp broadcast this morning about
[26:23] First Corinthian 1 Corinthians 13 and we
[26:27] can have all the
[26:28] revelations all we can explain all of
[26:31] these things and Paul said even that I I
[26:33] would have faith to move
[26:36] mountains I mean how much Faith do we
[26:38] have but he said even Faith to move
[26:40] mountains and all the revelations and we
[26:43] think about all these Revelations that
[26:44] have been revealed in this day
[26:47] from the the Seven Seals and and and the
[26:52] ages and and the Thunders and all of
[26:55] these things Paul said uh
[26:58] I'll take love over all of it and that's
[27:02] what it is friends it's it's love it's
[27:05] the most important thing in the
[27:07] world the Apostle John said made these
[27:11] three words he said God is loved how
[27:15] beautiful how beautiful is the love that
[27:18] he loved us so much that he gave his
[27:20] only son how many of us would do that
[27:24] what he did he gave him for our
[27:27] well-being so that we might have an
[27:29] eternity with our with our
[27:32] Lord this book of
[27:34] Acts I I wanted to give just a a brief
[27:39] overview of the whole thing so what
[27:41] we're going to do is tonight I'm going
[27:42] to go through the first half just hit
[27:44] some of the highlights and then next
[27:46] week brother Lyle will go through the
[27:50] second half the first half of the book
[27:52] is mainly the Apostle Peter and his
[27:56] ministry then it's with switches to the
[27:58] Apostle Paul and he goes forward and
[28:01] preaching the gospel we know that the
[28:05] book of Acts was
[28:07] written by
[28:09] Luke this wonderful man very talented
[28:14] and he used his talents to serve the
[28:16] Lord so let's let's start in Acts
[28:19] 1:1 and it reads like this the former
[28:23] treaties have I made o
[28:25] theopolis all of that Jesus began both
[28:29] to do and to
[28:31] teach that word
[28:34] treaties it's a book or it's a letter
[28:37] it's a document so what Luke is saying
[28:40] is he's saying this letter that I wrote
[28:43] to you
[28:44] before I was talking about what Jesus
[28:48] began to
[28:50] do so let's make sure we we are right
[28:54] with the author of this book so let's go
[28:57] to Luke 1 and let's see what the author
[29:00] of Acts was talking about Luke
[29:03] 1:1 he says this for as much as many
[29:08] have taken in hand to set forth in order
[29:11] a declaration of those things which are
[29:13] most surely believed among us even as
[29:16] they delivered them unto us which from
[29:18] the beginning were eyewitnesses and
[29:20] Ministers of the word you can tell that
[29:23] our friend Luke is also very
[29:24] intellectual
[29:26] brother it's seemed good to me also
[29:28] having had a perfect understanding of
[29:31] all things from the very first to write
[29:34] unto thee in order most excellent
[29:39] theopolis that thou mightest know the
[29:42] certainty of those things wherein thou
[29:45] Hast been
[29:46] instructed let me read that keep the
[29:49] King James version up there let's go
[29:50] back to verse three and let me read that
[29:52] in the English Standard Version it says
[29:54] this it seemed good to me also having
[29:57] followed all things closely for for some
[30:01] time past to write an orderly account
[30:04] for you oh most excellent theopolis that
[30:07] you may have certainty concerning the
[30:10] things that you have been
[30:14] taught so this man theopolis theopolis
[30:17] first of all it means lover of God so
[30:20] this man had a desire to understand who
[30:25] this man Jesus was was and what all of
[30:29] this new movement of Christianity was
[30:31] about he had a desire to see these
[30:34] things it struck his heart so he either
[30:39] hired Luke or or he asked Luke to give
[30:44] him a report so Luke sends him a report
[30:49] the first
[30:50] report which is the Book of
[30:55] Luke so then Luke sends him the second
[30:58] report and it is this book of Acts again
[31:02] I'll read the book of Acts chapter one
[31:04] again the former treaties have I made o
[31:06] theopolis of all that Jesus began to do
[31:11] and to
[31:12] teach all the all the translations that
[31:15] you read of that scripture say the same
[31:17] thing that Jesus began to do it doesn't
[31:21] say that he did it says that he began to
[31:25] do so this document that Luke sent to
[31:27] theopolis this book of Acts he's saying
[31:30] that this life of Christ that this is
[31:32] what he began to do but hey theopolis
[31:35] there's more to this whole
[31:37] story sending them this letter he's
[31:40] saying hey it was it didn't end when he
[31:42] rose from the dead and went up to the to
[31:44] the father he said now it's continuing
[31:48] on in these people called his
[31:52] disciples so this whole book of Acts is
[31:55] that Luke saying hey the
[31:57] there's more to the
[32:00] gospel verse
[32:02] two until the day in which he was taking
[32:06] up taken up after that he through the
[32:09] Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto
[32:11] the apostles whom he had chosen now he's
[32:14] talking about his previous book here
[32:16] he's talking about the resurrection
[32:18] story in the Book of Luke each Gospel
[32:21] Matthew Mark Luke and John they all give
[32:23] a different account of Jesus's life
[32:27] Matthew
[32:28] Mark and John probably all maybe knew
[32:33] Jesus Matthew for sure and John for sure
[32:35] Mark most likely Luke all of his was
[32:40] research interviewing people like Peter
[32:44] people like James doing his research on
[32:48] this but they all tell the same story
[32:51] the gospels from different
[32:53] perspectives to whom also he showed
[32:56] himself a alive after his Passion by
[32:58] many infallible proofs being seen of
[33:01] them 40 days and speaking of things
[33:03] pertaining to the kingdom of God and
[33:05] being assembled together with them
[33:08] commanded them that they should not
[33:10] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[33:13] promise of the Father which sayith he
[33:16] this is Jesus talking now which have
[33:20] which ye have heard of me for John truly
[33:24] baptized with water but ye shall be
[33:27] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[33:31] days
[33:32] hence a
[33:35] tremendous prophecy and Promise by the
[33:39] Lord Jesus this is
[33:41] foreshadowing by the author Luke he's
[33:43] reminding the reader that Jesus made
[33:46] this promise before he ascended up to
[33:48] the father and this is going to come
[33:51] true but you got to keep reading my book
[33:54] theopolis you got to keep going because
[33:57] it's just going to get better and
[33:59] better when they therefore were come
[34:03] together they asked of him saying Lord
[34:05] wilt thou at this time restore again the
[34:07] kingdom to Israel and he said unto them
[34:10] it is not for you to know the time or
[34:13] the season which the father hath put in
[34:15] his power but ye shall receive power
[34:18] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[34:20] you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me
[34:23] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[34:26] in Samaria
[34:27] and unto the uttermost part of the earth
[34:31] and when he had spoken these things
[34:33] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[34:36] cloud received him out of their sight
[34:38] and while they steadfastly looked toward
[34:41] Heaven as he went up behold two men
[34:44] stood by them in white apparel which
[34:46] also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye
[34:49] up gazing into heaven this same Jesus
[34:52] which is taking taken up from you into
[34:55] heaven shall
[34:57] so come in like manner as he as you have
[35:00] seen him go into
[35:02] heaven so the
[35:04] theme or the outline for this entire
[35:08] book of Acts right there is acts 1 ver8
[35:13] but ye shall receive power this is a
[35:15] promise from the Lord Jesus but ye shall
[35:18] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[35:22] is come upon you and you shall be
[35:24] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[35:27] in all of Judea and in Samaria and to
[35:29] the uttermost part of the
[35:33] earth now the Fulfillment of that
[35:38] prophecy was probably aside from the
[35:43] resurrection of Christ it was probably
[35:45] the greatest day in the history of the
[35:49] world was the Fulfillment of that
[35:52] prophecy that Jesus just said that you
[35:54] will be endued with power from on high
[35:58] so let's go to Acts chapter 2 verse one
[36:02] and let's read about what happened now
[36:04] remember Jesus died was resurrected went
[36:09] up to heaven made this promise that hey
[36:12] you are going to receive this power but
[36:15] just wait until that happens he said go
[36:19] to Jerusalem and just wait for this to
[36:22] happen and here it is it's called the
[36:24] day of Pentecost and when the day of
[36:27] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[36:30] with one Accord in one place and
[36:34] suddenly they CA there came a sound from
[36:37] Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[36:40] filled the house where they were sitting
[36:42] and there appeared unto them cloven
[36:45] tongues like as of fire and it sat upon
[36:48] each of them and they were all filled
[36:52] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[36:54] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[36:57] them utterance now this Pillar of Fire
[36:59] that came down these tongues of fire
[37:02] this isn't the first time that this has
[37:04] happened do you remember with Moses in
[37:07] the wilderness you remember the pillar
[37:08] of fire in the burning bush remember the
[37:10] pillar of Fire by night and the pillar
[37:12] of cloud by day do you remember when
[37:15] when when Solomon built the temple that
[37:18] the pillar of fire came down and filled
[37:21] the
[37:22] temple
[37:23] now that same Pillar of Fire that filled
[37:27] that Temple now filled this Temple right
[37:31] here the Temple of Flesh 120 of them in
[37:36] the upper
[37:37] room and they were all filled with the
[37:39] Holy Ghost and began to speak with
[37:41] tongues as the spirit gave them
[37:44] utterance so they walked into this Upper
[37:48] Room you remember what was happening
[37:50] they had just killed
[37:52] Jesus they were afraid they were scared
[37:56] to death they were hiding from the
[37:59] Romans and they were hiding from the
[38:00] Jews they and they went up into this
[38:02] Upper Room 12 of them and they were
[38:05] staying there they were waiting for this
[38:07] promise they had no idea what it was
[38:09] going to be but they were waiting for
[38:11] this promise to
[38:13] come and here remember acts: 18 says
[38:17] Jesus promised that you shall receive
[38:19] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[38:21] upon you and then you shall be witness
[38:24] to me in both
[38:25] Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria
[38:28] and to the uttermost parts of the earth
[38:31] so then this happen so they're in the
[38:33] they're in in this upper room and
[38:36] they're praying and and and doing what
[38:40] they were doing they were waiting for
[38:41] this promise to come to pass it was like
[38:43] 10 days that they were up there and then
[38:47] they
[38:48] see these pillars of fire they look like
[38:52] tongues of fire over their heads and
[38:56] then they started
[38:58] speaking in unknown tongues and these
[39:01] these other
[39:02] languages so they they go up from the
[39:05] room now they weren't afraid anymore
[39:09] these people were about to kill them and
[39:10] they're up there hiding out now they run
[39:13] downstairs and they start preaching the
[39:15] gospel and they're so filled with this
[39:18] spirit that they're just they're they're
[39:20] they're
[39:21] swaying and they're they're speaking in
[39:25] these different not unknown tongues that
[39:28] we think of tongues they're speaking in
[39:29] other
[39:31] languages it might be Spanish it might
[39:34] be French it might be it might be
[39:37] Swahili it it's whatever language that
[39:41] the people that were listening to them
[39:43] spoke is the language that they were
[39:46] speaking to these people they were doing
[39:48] it to preach the gospel to them the
[39:51] Gospel of Jesus Christ coming right out
[39:54] of this room this a never happened
[39:57] before so
[40:00] now we get to hear the very first
[40:05] sermon by the very first holy spirit
[40:10] filled Christian and I just I just want
[40:14] to read it verbatim because it is
[40:16] beautiful so right after they had
[40:20] received the Holy Spirit the very first
[40:22] Holy Spirit-filled Christians they go
[40:24] down and this man Peter who Jesus said
[40:27] you have the key keys to the kingdom
[40:30] this man Peter preaches the very first
[40:34] sermon by a holy spirit filled Christian
[40:39] brother but Peter standing up with the
[40:41] 11 verse
[40:43] 14 but Peter standing up with the 11
[40:45] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[40:48] you men of Judea and all that dwell at
[40:51] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[40:53] hearken unto my words listen to
[40:57] me for these not are Dr for these are
[41:00] not drunken as you suppose theing is but
[41:03] but the third hour of the day it was
[41:04] only 9:00 in the morning and they're out
[41:06] there swaying in the power of the Holy
[41:09] Spirit but this is that which was spoken
[41:13] of by the prophet Joel now Peter
[41:17] quotes the book of The Book of Joel and
[41:20] he says and it shall come to pass in the
[41:22] last days saith God I will pour out my
[41:24] spirit upon All Flesh
[41:26] and your sons and your daughters shall
[41:28] prophesy and your young men shall see
[41:30] visions and your old men shall dream
[41:32] dreams and on my servants and on my
[41:35] handmaidens that says right there that a
[41:37] man and a woman can receive the Holy
[41:40] Spirit right here I will pour out in
[41:43] those days of my spirit and they shall
[41:46] prophesy and I will show wonders in
[41:48] Heaven above and in signs beneath blood
[41:52] and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun
[41:55] shall be turned into darkness and the
[41:56] moon into the blood for the great and
[41:59] notable day of the Lord come before the
[42:03] great and notable day of the Lord come
[42:05] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[42:08] shall call on the name of the Lord shall
[42:11] be
[42:12] saved I wonder what they were
[42:15] thinking all right Peter what are you
[42:16] talking about the name of the
[42:19] Lord ye men of Israel hear these
[42:23] words Jesus of Nazareth
[42:27] a man approved of God among you by
[42:29] Miracles and wonders and signs which God
[42:32] did by him in the midst of you as ye
[42:35] yourselves also know him being delivered
[42:38] by the determinant counsel and forn
[42:40] knowledge of God ye have taken and by
[42:42] Wicked hands have crucified and
[42:46] slain whom God ha raised up having loose
[42:50] the Pains of death because it was not
[42:52] possible that he should be Holden of it
[42:55] for David speaking
[42:56] concerning him I foresaw the lord always
[42:59] before my face for he is on my right
[43:01] hand that I should not be moved he's
[43:03] quoting the prophet
[43:05] David therefore did my heart rejoice and
[43:08] my tongue was glad moreover also my
[43:10] flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou
[43:12] Wilt not leave my soul in Hell neither
[43:15] wilt thou s suffer thy Holy One to see
[43:17] corruption thou Hast made known to me
[43:20] the ways of life that thou shalt make me
[43:23] full of joy with thy countenance now
[43:26] what is Peter
[43:27] doing he's taking the prophet David's
[43:29] words and applying them to Christ a true
[43:33] minister of the Gospel a true
[43:36] preacher men and
[43:38] Brethren let me Fe freely speak unto you
[43:41] of the patriarch David that he is both
[43:43] dead and buried and his supplier is with
[43:47] us unto this
[43:48] day back to verse 27 because thou wi not
[43:51] leave my soul in Hell neither shall
[43:54] neither shalt thou make I'm sorry
[43:56] neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to
[43:58] see corruption and he's like hey he
[44:01] wasn't talking about himself David
[44:03] wasn't he was talking about someone
[44:07] else therefore being a prophet and
[44:11] knowing speaking of David therefore
[44:13] being a prophet and knowing that God had
[44:14] sworn with an oath to him that the fruit
[44:18] of his loins according to the flesh he
[44:20] would raise up Christ to sit on his
[44:23] throne he seeing this before spake of
[44:25] the resurrection of Christ that his soul
[44:28] was not left in Hell neither his neither
[44:31] his flesh did see corruption when when
[44:34] he's talking about the that corruption
[44:36] he's talking about the body
[44:40] rotting and and it was it was thought
[44:43] and taught that the body starts to to
[44:46] rot after three days and that's that's
[44:49] what he's talking about right here and
[44:51] that his flesh did not see corruption
[44:54] this Jesus hath God God raised up
[44:57] wherewith we are all
[44:59] Witnesses therefore being by the right
[45:01] hand of God exalted and having received
[45:04] of the Father the promise of the Holy
[45:06] Ghost he ha shed forth this which ye now
[45:09] see and hear for David is not ascended
[45:12] into Heavens into the heavens David
[45:15] didn't fulfill these
[45:16] prophecies but he saith himself the Lord
[45:20] said unto my Lord sit thou on my right
[45:23] hand until I make thy full thy foot Thy
[45:27] Thy foes thy foot stols therefore let
[45:29] the house of Israel know assuredly that
[45:32] God hath made the same Jesus remember
[45:36] who he's talking to this is all about
[45:38] Jews by the way until we get to the
[45:40] seventh chapter this is all about
[45:42] Jerusalem really until we get to the
[45:45] seventh chapter so he's saying this he's
[45:47] saying that know assuredly that God had
[45:50] made the same Jesus who you all
[45:54] crucified
[45:59] both Lord and
[46:05] Christ now when they heard this they
[46:08] were pricked in their they were cut in
[46:10] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[46:12] the rest of the Apostles men and
[46:14] Brethren what shall we do this condemned
[46:17] them there was some truth in these
[46:20] people that Peter was speaking to Peter
[46:23] said unto them repent and be B baptize
[46:26] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[46:27] Christ for the remission of sins and ye
[46:30] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[46:33] if you do this you'll receive the same
[46:35] thing that we just received in the upper
[46:39] room for the promise is unto
[46:42] you and to your children and to all that
[46:46] are far off even as many as the Lord Our
[46:49] God shall
[46:51] call all of us even even the ones that
[46:55] have been recently
[46:58] baptized and with many other words did
[47:00] he testify and exhort saying save
[47:03] yourself from this unto UNT generation
[47:06] this crooked generation then they that
[47:09] gladly received his word were baptized
[47:12] and the same day were added unto them
[47:14] about 3,000 souls and they continued
[47:16] steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and
[47:19] fellowship and in Breaking of bread and
[47:21] in prayers and fear Came Upon every soul
[47:24] and many wonders and signs were done by
[47:27] the apostles very very
[47:30] important scripture right there and Many
[47:33] Wonders and signs were done by these
[47:36] Apostles exactly had Jesus as Jesus had
[47:40] done they preached like Jesus and they
[47:43] did Miracles like Jesus had done this
[47:47] right here what I just read those 3,000
[47:51] those 120 in the upper room right there
[47:54] we see the birth of the Christian Church
[47:59] the birth of every church that any of us
[48:01] have ever been to Christian Church it
[48:04] was born right
[48:07] there and we look we've learned through
[48:10] our book of Acts that it's commonly
[48:13] called it's written in our Bibles not in
[48:15] the scripture but it's written in the
[48:16] title that these are the Acts of the
[48:20] Apostles we know that that's not a
[48:22] proper name for it it's the acts of the
[48:25] Holy Spirit in the apostles it's the
[48:29] acts of Jesus Christ in the apostles so
[48:33] if you have the spirit of Christ in you
[48:36] if I have the spirit of Christ in you in
[48:39] me then I'm going to do the same thing
[48:42] that Jesus did and you'll see this book
[48:45] of Acts these disciples are just doing
[48:48] the same thing that Jesus did it's a
[48:53] continuation of the Gospel of what Jesus
[48:56] did now they're just going to do the
[48:58] same thing but also and this is the sad
[49:02] part this is what not many people talk
[49:04] about but the same spirit that crucified
[49:09] Jesus that said hey you were eating
[49:11] eating wheat on the Sabbath you were out
[49:14] in the fields on the Sabbath The Same
[49:17] Spirit that crucified Jesus because he
[49:20] didn't teach like them because he didn't
[49:22] act like them because he didn't teach
[49:24] the same God goel of them because he
[49:27] didn't respect they thought the law of
[49:31] Moses that same Spirit didn't die with
[49:36] the ones that crucified Jesus it
[49:38] continued on just as the Holy Spirit
[49:41] continued on with the
[49:43] disciples we'll see
[49:46] that wherever There's a Hero there's
[49:49] always a
[49:50] villain you can't have a hero without a
[49:52] villain and we see see that that same
[49:57] spirit is going to rise up and say the
[49:59] same things and do the same things so
[50:01] then we go to the the next chapter in
[50:05] Acts chapter 3 and we see that okay
[50:09] they've they've been preaching and
[50:11] they've been they've been witnessing and
[50:14] and the power of the Holy Spirit came
[50:15] down and here we go with two of the
[50:18] disciples two of the most well-known
[50:19] disciples Peter and
[50:22] John John was the one that laid his head
[50:25] on Jesus's bosom Peter is the one that's
[50:28] spoken of throughout all of the gospels
[50:31] and all that Peter did so we have Peter
[50:33] and
[50:33] John now filled with the Holy
[50:37] Spirit they're walking up to the
[50:41] temple they go to the gate of the temple
[50:45] and here is a man is laying at the
[50:48] temple at the Temple
[50:51] Gate deformed from birth born crippled
[50:57] couldn't make a living couldn't couldn't
[51:00] do anything that most people can do and
[51:03] there he is laying
[51:05] there and he's he's he's laying there
[51:07] and he's probably got this cup out and
[51:09] he's asking for a handout a donation
[51:11] that's how he made his living and and
[51:13] everybody had seen him there every day
[51:15] that's where he was that's where he he
[51:17] got his money to go buy food so he's
[51:19] laying there Here Come Peter and John
[51:22] and Peter looks down at him
[51:25] and he looks up at
[51:29] Peter and he asks him will you give me a
[51:35] donation will you give me some help
[51:38] Peter looks down at
[51:41] him and he says
[51:43] this he says Silver and Gold Have I None
[51:48] I don't have any money to give
[51:50] you he tells the man he says look look
[51:53] up here look at
[51:54] us
[51:56] he looks down he says Silver and Gold
[51:58] Have I None but what I have what does he
[52:02] have he has the Holy Spirit he has the
[52:06] same spirit that Jesus Christ had in had
[52:09] in him now it's in this man Peter now
[52:12] it's in this man John and what's he GNA
[52:14] do do you remember the pool of
[52:17] Bethesda the pool of Bethesda Jesus
[52:20] comes up there's a man laying there that
[52:22] he couldn't there was something wrong
[52:24] with him he couldn't get up he couldn't
[52:26] get over to the pool there was a
[52:28] tradition that the angel would come to
[52:30] the pool and churn churn up the water
[52:33] and if you could get into that
[52:35] pool then you would be healed of
[52:38] whatever sickness so Jesus comes to him
[52:40] and he says hey why don't you get into
[52:42] the pool and he says people I'm crippled
[52:45] I can't people will just cut me off and
[52:47] people will get in front of me and I
[52:48] can't get in there so so Jesus looks
[52:51] down at
[52:53] him and he heals him
[52:56] so now we have the same spirit that is
[53:00] in John and in Peter and here's a
[53:02] crippled man I wonder if they remembered
[53:05] what Jesus had done Peter says Silver
[53:08] and Gold Have I None but what I have I
[53:10] give to you in the name of Jesus Christ
[53:13] of Nazareth rise up and walk and the man
[53:16] he didn't just stand up he leapt up he
[53:22] jumped
[53:24] up and received the strength in his
[53:27] ankles and his feet and everyone all of
[53:31] these people knew this
[53:32] man and they saw that he had been
[53:37] healed and what did they
[53:39] do they hated them for it just as they
[53:43] hated Jesus for when he did it what did
[53:46] they say to
[53:47] Jesus he healed them on the
[53:50] Sabbath give me a break you healed them
[53:53] on the Sabbath that's the best that they
[53:54] could come up with let me see if it had
[53:58] been me I'd probably said well let me
[53:59] see you do it but no
[54:01] Jesus Jesus had his he was God and he's
[54:05] the spirit that we want he didn't he
[54:08] didn't say like I would have
[54:10] said but he just went on and here comes
[54:15] Peter and John and they do the same
[54:18] thing at the gate called
[54:20] Beautiful exactly as I said what Jesus
[54:25] had
[54:26] done so then everybody sees this happen
[54:29] then Peter preaches another sermon it's
[54:31] the same thing it's this Jesus is the
[54:34] Fulfillment of all of the
[54:38] prophets chapter
[54:41] 4 after this man had been healed at the
[54:44] gate it's called the the gate called
[54:45] Beautiful which is the gate to the
[54:48] temple the priests of the temple and the
[54:52] Sadducees Came Upon them and and being
[54:56] grieved they taught the people and
[54:58] preached that
[55:01] Jesus that through Jesus the
[55:03] resurrection from the dead do you
[55:04] remember the difference between the
[55:06] Pharisees and the Sadducees from weeks
[55:09] ago the Sadducees they were the pompous
[55:14] stuck up priests and they were they had
[55:19] their perfect clothes and they had their
[55:21] shoes and they had whatever they wore on
[55:23] their heads and they were the temple wor
[55:26] the temple workers and they did not
[55:29] believe in miracles they didn't believe
[55:33] in many many things in fact they pretty
[55:35] much just only believed what Moses said
[55:38] they were pompous we're too good for
[55:40] even other prophets we just believe
[55:42] Moses he's good enough for us that's
[55:45] that's all we're we're better he's the
[55:46] best of all them so we're just going to
[55:47] stick to him and another thing they
[55:50] didn't believe very important they
[55:52] didn't believe in a resurrection from
[55:54] the dead
[55:55] so when Peter is
[55:57] preaching he's saying that by this man
[56:01] Jesus we were able to raise this man up
[56:05] to this crippled man and they knew that
[56:09] Jesus had died they saw him die on the
[56:12] cross so now they see Jesus that he's
[56:16] saying that Jesus is the one that able
[56:18] is able to do this and he rose from the
[56:20] dead and this these people have to be
[56:22] false because they're saying that it's a
[56:25] resurrection and our beliefs and our
[56:28] Creeds and our doctrines and our dogmas
[56:30] and everything else do not believe in a
[56:32] resurrection so they must be
[56:36] false didn't care that the man was just
[56:40] healed they must be false because it
[56:42] doesn't match our
[56:46] Doctrine those Spirits don't
[56:49] die they were there when Jesus was here
[56:52] they're there in the book of Acts and
[56:53] they're here today just because you
[56:55] don't match my
[56:57] Doctrine you must be
[56:59] false so these Sadducees are the first
[57:03] ones that come against come against
[57:06] Peter and James and John and all of
[57:11] this and when the disciples aren't
[57:13] preaching their Doctrine they're
[57:16] immediately immediately come after them
[57:19] we don't obviously you can't kill
[57:22] somebody today you can hate them and
[57:25] Jesus tells us he said if you hate
[57:27] somebody without a
[57:28] cause he's speaking maybe thousands of
[57:32] years later for today then you have
[57:34] murdered that person it was what Jesus
[57:37] said he said if you just
[57:41] want to have an affair in your wife if
[57:43] you just want to be with another woman
[57:47] that's not your wife he says you've
[57:48] already committed
[57:49] adultery he says if you hate a Man
[57:52] Without a Cause if you hate him
[57:55] then you have committed murder you have
[57:58] murdered that
[58:00] man that's today
[58:03] obviously people aren't going to murder
[58:05] like the Sadducees did
[58:07] here but they will attack someone's
[58:12] character that's what Spirit do we have
[58:15] all of
[58:16] us do we have the spirit of Christ the
[58:19] spirit of love that we are the ones
[58:23] Healing The Sick preaching love
[58:25] preaching
[58:27] Christ or does the spirit of legalism
[58:31] where we condemn anyone who doesn't have
[58:33] the same doctrines of us or hold the
[58:35] same values of us what Spirit do we
[58:38] have and they laid hands on them and put
[58:42] them in hold until the next day for it
[58:44] was now even tide how be it many of them
[58:48] which heard the word believed and the
[58:49] number of the men was about
[58:53] 5,000 boy I would love to see a a
[58:56] Revival like that boy I mean I think I
[58:59] do really good to get one person to come
[59:01] to church 5,000 in one
[59:05] day oh I would have loved to have seen
[59:08] it brother Jordan wouldn't you just have
[59:10] loved to see all these people gathered
[59:12] around Peter and John and saying you
[59:15] know what he's
[59:21] right and it came to pass on the
[59:23] tomorrow that their ruler and elders and
[59:25] scribes and Annis the high priest and
[59:27] cesis and John and Alexander And as many
[59:31] as were of the Kindred of the high
[59:33] priest were gathered together at
[59:34] Jerusalem these are the same guys that
[59:37] crucified Jesus the
[59:39] Sadducees and when they had set them in
[59:42] the midst they asked them by what power
[59:44] about what name have you done
[59:48] this they just healed the
[59:51] guy how' you do this because you can't
[59:53] be right
[59:57] they can never imagine that a miracle or
[59:59] God could be done outside their own
[1:00:01] faith then Peter filled with the Holy
[1:00:03] Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the
[1:00:05] people and Elders of Israel if we this
[1:00:08] day be examined of the good deed done by
[1:00:10] the impotent Man by what means he has
[1:00:13] made whole be it known unto you and to
[1:00:16] all the people of Israel that by the
[1:00:18] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth who you
[1:00:23] crucified whom God has raised from the
[1:00:26] dead these are the people that don't
[1:00:27] believe in the
[1:00:28] resurrection who God raised from the
[1:00:31] dead even by him does this man stand
[1:00:34] here before you
[1:00:36] whole preaching the gospel boldness
[1:00:39] while they were running away just maybe
[1:00:42] a couple days
[1:00:43] earlier now they're standing there with
[1:00:46] the same people that crucified that
[1:00:49] crucified Jesus that was chasing them
[1:00:52] and here's Peter saying the the one that
[1:00:55] you crucified he raised from the dead
[1:00:58] that's by what power that we're doing
[1:01:00] these things I love the boldness of
[1:01:04] these brothers and just the the power
[1:01:07] that they had the confidence that they
[1:01:11] had of what they were pre preaching was
[1:01:13] the absolute
[1:01:16] truth and then chapter
[1:01:19] five in the book of Acts we see this
[1:01:22] story about ananas and safire do you
[1:01:24] remember that story everyone was giving
[1:01:27] everything that they had to this
[1:01:29] movement of Christianity they were
[1:01:31] giving all they would sell their land
[1:01:33] and and give it just so they could send
[1:01:36] the disciples out to preach the gospel
[1:01:38] and here comes this ananas and
[1:01:41] sa and they didn't give everything but
[1:01:44] they said that they gave everything have
[1:01:46] you heard the term the sign of the
[1:01:50] Messiah Discerning the secrets of their
[1:01:52] heart Peter does it right right
[1:01:55] here they came before him and Peter says
[1:01:59] hey you didn't give all of it but you
[1:02:01] said you didn't have to give any of it
[1:02:03] it was yours to begin with but because
[1:02:05] you
[1:02:06] lied ananas came first he dropped
[1:02:11] dead his wife comes
[1:02:15] second Peter says hey did you give all
[1:02:18] of it she says
[1:02:19] yep she drops
[1:02:23] dead
[1:02:24] then the Sadducees in chapter 5 they
[1:02:28] continue their persecution of the
[1:02:30] Disciples of Jesus then in chapter
[1:02:34] six we see the disciples and they're
[1:02:37] going around and they're preaching the
[1:02:38] gospel and and they're they're Healing
[1:02:41] The Sick and they're they're doing all
[1:02:42] of these things and and they get
[1:02:46] tired and there's a whole lot to do and
[1:02:50] they forgot that hey we have the people
[1:02:52] in the church that need
[1:02:55] food and you're neglecting them and the
[1:02:58] widows these widows they don't have a
[1:03:00] bread winner so isn't the church
[1:03:02] supposed to supposed to give these these
[1:03:05] widows food and to help everybody and
[1:03:07] they're like oh yeah well but we can't
[1:03:11] spend all of our time doing that we're
[1:03:13] out here winning souls to Christ so then
[1:03:17] they
[1:03:18] choose seven
[1:03:21] men to be what's called
[1:03:25] deacons these men were just great men of
[1:03:30] God and then those
[1:03:34] deacons we don't hear we we just hear
[1:03:37] about we can't have a book that says
[1:03:41] everything everybody that was going out
[1:03:43] and doing things but now that that these
[1:03:45] deacons have been named now the the book
[1:03:48] starts talking about these deacons and
[1:03:50] they're going out and they're Healing
[1:03:52] The Sick and they're preaching the
[1:03:54] gospel and they're doing all these
[1:03:55] things it shows you that it doesn't have
[1:03:57] to be the pastor that it doesn't have to
[1:04:00] be an
[1:04:01] apostle that it needs to be all of us
[1:04:05] that are out winning Souls that are
[1:04:08] praying for the
[1:04:09] sick you don't have to come here to this
[1:04:13] altar to be
[1:04:15] healed all of us should be living a life
[1:04:19] like the people in this book of Acts
[1:04:22] that we can lay our hands on the sick
[1:04:25] and they would recover and the Bible
[1:04:27] goes through the book of Acts goes
[1:04:29] through these men are doing these great
[1:04:31] Miracles and here comes this
[1:04:34] Deacon named
[1:04:37] Stephen and Stephen is out preaching the
[1:04:40] gospel he's doing all of these Miracles
[1:04:43] he's Healing The Sick and here come the
[1:04:46] high priest the high priest
[1:04:48] himself listen to
[1:04:51] Stephen did not like him preaching
[1:04:54] preaching this resurrected Jesus
[1:04:57] Christ so he
[1:04:59] goes and they get all the people riled
[1:05:03] up and
[1:05:05] Stephen is
[1:05:08] there they pick up Stones they take him
[1:05:10] outside the city they pick up Stones
[1:05:13] Here
[1:05:15] Comes this young man I gave the the
[1:05:20] description of him I don't know a few
[1:05:23] couple months ago
[1:05:26] short stocky
[1:05:29] bowlegged his eyes closed together his
[1:05:32] eyebrows touched in the
[1:05:34] middle young man standing
[1:05:37] there zealous for what he believed
[1:05:41] zealous for the word of Moses zealous
[1:05:43] for the law he wasn't a sadducee this
[1:05:46] young man is a Pharisee the other
[1:05:49] sect of of these Jews and he was there
[1:05:53] and and he saw saw this man Stephen
[1:05:55] preaching these things that this Jesus
[1:05:58] Christ was the Fulfillment of the
[1:06:00] Messiah and he himself was God and it
[1:06:03] raised up this indignation in this man
[1:06:06] this young man he
[1:06:08] hated
[1:06:10] hated what they what he was
[1:06:13] preaching he consented he said go
[1:06:17] ahead they cast this man stepen outside
[1:06:21] of the
[1:06:22] city picked up
[1:06:26] Stones before Stephen
[1:06:30] preaches
[1:06:32] the in my opinion the most beautiful
[1:06:36] sermon if you want to be introduced or
[1:06:39] you want to introduce someone to the
[1:06:41] Lord Jesus and there's someone that that
[1:06:43] knows
[1:06:45] History Stephen preaches the most
[1:06:47] beautiful sermon you've ever heard in
[1:06:50] this Acts chapter
[1:06:53] 6
[1:06:54] chapter
[1:06:56] 7 and
[1:06:59] then Stevens cast outside the city this
[1:07:02] Saul I was talking about this young
[1:07:06] man consents to his death they pick up
[1:07:08] stones and they start throwing these
[1:07:10] stones at
[1:07:15] Stephen acts 7: 59 says
[1:07:19] this and they stoned Stephen calling
[1:07:24] upon
[1:07:25] God and saying Lord Jesus receive my
[1:07:28] spirit so so G so they're stoning
[1:07:30] Stephen Stephen is calling upon God and
[1:07:33] saying Lord Jesus receive my
[1:07:38] spirit do you remember the spirit of
[1:07:42] Christ what it
[1:07:44] does and he kneeled down and he cried
[1:07:48] with a loud
[1:07:50] voice Lord lay not this sin to their
[1:07:54] charge and when he had said this he fell
[1:07:57] asleep do you remember the author of
[1:08:01] Acts
[1:08:03] Luke let's turn to Luke chapter 23 and I
[1:08:08] want to see if what I just
[1:08:11] read when Stephen knelt down and cried
[1:08:14] with a loud voice as these stones are
[1:08:15] hitting him he said Lord lay not this
[1:08:18] sin to their CH their charge and when he
[1:08:20] had said this he fell
[1:08:22] asleep Luke chap 23 verse 34 here is the
[1:08:27] man that was filled with the
[1:08:30] spirit nailed to the
[1:08:35] cross and here's what he
[1:08:38] says then said
[1:08:41] Jesus he's looking down upon these men
[1:08:45] that crucified him his own Brethren that
[1:08:48] nailed him to this cross and he says
[1:08:51] this father forgive them for they know
[1:08:56] not what they
[1:08:59] do and they parted his reignment and
[1:09:01] cast
[1:09:03] lots there's the same spirit that was in
[1:09:06] this great man
[1:09:08] Stephen saying Lord forgive
[1:09:12] him but one thing Stephen didn't say the
[1:09:16] next
[1:09:18] verse then Jesus
[1:09:20] said father forgive them for they know
[1:09:22] not what they do
[1:09:24] and they parted his reignment and cast
[1:09:26] lots now let's skip to verse 46 in Luke
[1:09:30] 23 says this now here's something Jesus
[1:09:34] or Stephen did not say and when Jesus
[1:09:37] had cried with a loud voice he said
[1:09:39] father into thy hands I commend my
[1:09:45] spirit and having thus said he gave up
[1:09:47] the
[1:09:51] ghost Stephen didn't have the authority
[1:09:54] to lay down his life or to pick it up
[1:09:56] again but Jesus did he said Father Here
[1:10:00] is my spirit I'm going to die on my own
[1:10:04] accord on my own will Lord I am going to
[1:10:07] die he could have waved his hand he
[1:10:09] could have moved his
[1:10:11] finger and the angels would have came
[1:10:13] and ripped those Nails out and he would
[1:10:15] have been healed but he said
[1:10:17] Lord I commit my spirit into your
[1:10:22] hands now when Steph
[1:10:25] dies we see the first glimpse of this
[1:10:29] young man back to acts 8 we see the
[1:10:33] first glimpse of this man Saul of Tarsus
[1:10:35] and he was agreeing to Steph's death and
[1:10:39] after he's converted he mentions how
[1:10:41] wrong he was when he was there that must
[1:10:44] have really bothered him imagine there
[1:10:46] is Saul there's this young man and he's
[1:10:49] seeing this this man there maybe
[1:10:52] kneeling down and these rocks hitting
[1:10:54] them and he sees this man look up and
[1:10:58] say father forgive
[1:11:01] him it must have made an impression on
[1:11:03] this young man it's something that he
[1:11:05] never
[1:11:06] forgot that Paul never
[1:11:09] forgot later on this Spirit just welled
[1:11:14] up in in in this man Saul of tarus and
[1:11:18] he goes and he starts persecuting all
[1:11:20] the Christians he rose to the very top
[1:11:22] to where he was the chief persecutor of
[1:11:25] them all and here he
[1:11:28] is going to
[1:11:32] Damascus to persecute he's got the
[1:11:35] letters in his hands I've Got The Power
[1:11:38] I am going to take these people we're
[1:11:40] going to kill them we're going to shut
[1:11:41] this stuff out this is causing our
[1:11:44] children to go astray it's causing all
[1:11:46] these problems we've got to shut these
[1:11:49] people called Christians
[1:11:52] down he's on his
[1:11:56] way and we see that he's knocked
[1:12:03] down we see that the Apostle
[1:12:07] is he's sincere as I said he is zealous
[1:12:12] in his belief but it shows you we can be
[1:12:14] sincerely wrong in how we believe and we
[1:12:17] can think that we're more right than
[1:12:19] anyone else and all of us do think that
[1:12:21] that we're right and that's how this man
[1:12:23] Paul was he thought he was right so much
[1:12:26] so that he was willing to take these
[1:12:28] people's
[1:12:30] lives
[1:12:32] zealous more learned more more into the
[1:12:36] scriptures knew his scriptures better
[1:12:37] than anyone under the very best of
[1:12:40] teachers and here he is going exactly
[1:12:44] against
[1:12:45] God reading the same Bible that Peter
[1:12:49] read
[1:12:51] against the Lord Jesus
[1:12:54] he's going on this road to Damascus he's
[1:12:55] got the letter in his hand he is going
[1:12:58] to condemn these people I have my orders
[1:13:00] here from the San hadrin Council going
[1:13:03] on the road he gets knocked
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:06] down loses his eyesight from this great
[1:13:09] flash of light and he knew that God was
[1:13:14] speaking and he says Lord who are
[1:13:18] you he hears this voice said Saul Saul
[1:13:22] why persecute us St me why are you
[1:13:24] persecuting me God
[1:13:28] speaking it shows you that if we
[1:13:30] persecute
[1:13:32] someone one of God's children talk bad
[1:13:35] about them kill them hurt them in any
[1:13:39] way that we are doing that to God
[1:13:42] himself he says this he says why are you
[1:13:45] persecuting me Saul says who are you
[1:13:49] Lord he says I am Jesus remember he was
[1:13:52] going to persecute the Christians and he
[1:13:54] says you're persecuting me Jesus right
[1:13:57] there we see a pivotal time in this book
[1:13:59] of Acts we
[1:14:01] see now the pendulum is starting to sway
[1:14:05] it just started now it's going from
[1:14:08] Peter and it's going to start to go to
[1:14:10] this man
[1:14:13] Paul so Paul now he takes
[1:14:18] off and he goes and studies in a
[1:14:21] different country he wants to make sure
[1:14:23] that he is right he wants to make sure
[1:14:26] Lord is what I believe was that really
[1:14:32] you speaking to me am I really right in
[1:14:34] these scriptures putting these
[1:14:35] scriptures together and saying that this
[1:14:38] man Christ is actually this man Jesus is
[1:14:41] actually the Messiah so now back to
[1:14:43] Peter and I like to read this chapter 9
[1:14:46] verse
[1:14:48] 36 now there was at japa a certain
[1:14:51] disciple named Tabitha which by
[1:14:53] interpretation is called Dorcas this
[1:14:55] woman was full of good works and alms
[1:14:57] Deeds which she did and it came to pass
[1:14:59] in those days that she was sick and died
[1:15:01] whom when they had washed they laid her
[1:15:04] in an upper chamber for as much as L was
[1:15:08] not a japa and the disciples had heard
[1:15:11] that Peter was there they sent unto him
[1:15:14] two men Desiring him that he would not
[1:15:18] delay to come to them and Peter arose
[1:15:22] and went with them
[1:15:23] when he was come they brought him into
[1:15:26] the upper chamber and all the W the
[1:15:28] widows stood by him weeping and showing
[1:15:32] the coats and garments by which Dorcas
[1:15:35] made while she was with them but Peter
[1:15:37] put them all forth he put them all
[1:15:41] out and he kneeled down and he prayed
[1:15:45] turning him and turning him to the body
[1:15:49] said Tabatha arise and she open opened
[1:15:53] her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat
[1:15:57] up a woman that was
[1:15:59] dead dead for some time and here comes
[1:16:03] Peter and he walks into this room and he
[1:16:06] says Tabitha
[1:16:09] arise and he gave her his hand and
[1:16:12] lifted her up and when he had called the
[1:16:15] Saints and widows presented her alive
[1:16:18] and it was known throughout all of japa
[1:16:20] and many believed in the Lord the Same
[1:16:24] Spirit that was on Christ let's turn to
[1:16:26] Luke 8:
[1:16:29] 41 the Lord Jesus
[1:16:32] now I wonder if Peter remembered this
[1:16:36] when he went into Tabitha he was there
[1:16:39] and I wonder if Peter remembered what
[1:16:41] had happened with Jesus and behold there
[1:16:44] came a man named gyrus and he was a
[1:16:47] ruler of the synagogue and he fell down
[1:16:49] at Jesus's feet and besought him that he
[1:16:52] would come into His house for he had
[1:16:54] only one daughter about 12 years of age
[1:16:56] and she lay a dying but as he went the
[1:17:01] people thronged him let's skip to verse
[1:17:04] 49 so now Jesus comes to this house or
[1:17:10] he's on his
[1:17:13] way while he yet spake there cometh one
[1:17:16] from the ruler of the synagogue's house
[1:17:18] saying unto him thy daughter is dead
[1:17:21] trouble not the master
[1:17:23] but when Jesus heard it he answered him
[1:17:25] saying fear not believe only and she
[1:17:27] shall be made whole and when he came
[1:17:29] into the house he suffered no man to go
[1:17:32] in exactly what Peter did except
[1:17:37] Peter I wonder if Jesus knew hey this is
[1:17:40] going to happen later on except Peter
[1:17:44] and James and John and the father and
[1:17:46] the mother of the
[1:17:48] maiden so for some reason Jesus wanted
[1:17:52] Peter in there
[1:17:53] I want you to witness
[1:17:55] this I wonder if I I assume Peter had no
[1:17:59] idea but I guarantee you when he went to
[1:18:03] Tabatha he remembered
[1:18:05] this and all wept and bewailed her but
[1:18:09] he said weep not she is not dead but
[1:18:11] sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn
[1:18:13] knowing that she was dead and he put
[1:18:15] them all
[1:18:17] out and he took her by the hand remember
[1:18:21] what Peter did and he took her by the
[1:18:23] hand and called saying maid
[1:18:26] arise and the Spirit came again and she
[1:18:29] Rose straightway and he commanded to
[1:18:32] give her
[1:18:33] meat exactly the same thing that
[1:18:38] happened in the book of Acts years
[1:18:43] later then we go on to chapter 10 and we
[1:18:47] see the message starts to go out we see
[1:18:51] from one to seven it just the message is
[1:18:54] just in Jerusalem and then from 8 and N
[1:18:58] the message starts going out to Judea
[1:19:00] still in Israel and then we see in 10
[1:19:03] here we see a big change we see the
[1:19:06] conversion of a
[1:19:09] gentile named cor
[1:19:11] Cornelius he was a centurion great
[1:19:16] man he
[1:19:18] sends for Peter to come he wants to hear
[1:19:22] this gospel Peter is in his house and he
[1:19:27] he he he goes up to the roof and he's
[1:19:29] praying and he has a vision and he has a
[1:19:32] vision of of these
[1:19:34] these animals coming down and they're
[1:19:38] what we would call what a Jew would call
[1:19:40] an unclean animal something that listen
[1:19:43] I am a staunch Jew I don't eat certain
[1:19:48] things because it's written in the law
[1:19:49] of Moses that I don't I don't eat these
[1:19:52] things I'm I'm I'm living right I'm
[1:19:54] doing all these things right and here
[1:19:56] comes these animals and Peter's hungry
[1:19:58] and God tells him Peter raise up and eat
[1:20:02] and Peter's like not
[1:20:04] me I believe your word God and here's
[1:20:08] God telling him to eat Peter's like I
[1:20:12] don't ever do that I don't do I don't I
[1:20:14] don't I don't eat anything unclean he
[1:20:16] gets rebuked by the Lord saying listen
[1:20:19] if I make it clean I don't care what you
[1:20:21] think Peter if if I make it clean it's
[1:20:24] clean I don't care if you think it
[1:20:26] doesn't look right I don't care if it
[1:20:27] doesn't match your Doctrine I'm God if I
[1:20:30] make it clean if I cleanse it it's
[1:20:34] clean so Peter then there's a knock at
[1:20:38] the
[1:20:38] door and it's a messenger from this man
[1:20:41] named Cornelius so now Peter goes to
[1:20:45] these Gentiles houses and he preaches
[1:20:48] the gospel to
[1:20:50] them and they receive
[1:20:53] Jesus Christ not only do they receive
[1:20:56] and give their hearts to the Lord but
[1:20:58] they receive the Holy Spirit a
[1:21:00] gentile so Peter not Paul Peter's the
[1:21:04] first one that converted the
[1:21:07] Gentiles so now we see Paul and he's
[1:21:11] he's out and about in this chapter 11
[1:21:13] and he's going around and he's traveling
[1:21:16] we see Peter um doing doing the same
[1:21:19] thing that he's doing and we're seeing
[1:21:20] this this paradigm shift to Paul's
[1:21:23] Ministry and away from Peter and then in
[1:21:26] chapter 12 we see the persecution goes
[1:21:30] from the Jews to the next level this man
[1:21:32] Herod one of the herods we've we've
[1:21:34] heard a lot about them this man Herod
[1:21:38] kills
[1:21:39] James the brother of John murders
[1:21:43] him and then he sees that it pleased the
[1:21:47] Jews which is the Pharisees and the
[1:21:50] Sadducees the priests so he goes after
[1:21:52] Peter now he's like hey if I kill
[1:21:55] James Peter's a bigger fish than James
[1:21:58] is so I'm going to kill him too so he
[1:22:00] gets Peter arrests him and he throws him
[1:22:03] in PRI prison and I love and this I
[1:22:07] almost cried this morning when I was
[1:22:09] reading
[1:22:10] this I love what
[1:22:13] happens here Peter's in prison and I
[1:22:17] thought
[1:22:18] about I was sending my messages out to
[1:22:22] you all saying hey pray for me I I could
[1:22:25] really use it I need to make some
[1:22:26] important
[1:22:27] decisions and it says here in chapter 12
[1:22:31] verse 5 Peter therefore was kept in
[1:22:35] prison but listen to this but prayer was
[1:22:39] made without ceasing of the church unto
[1:22:43] God for
[1:22:45] him so when we send out these prayer
[1:22:49] requests for
[1:22:51] WhatsApp it's to me it's going right
[1:22:54] back here to the book of Acts chapter
[1:22:58] 12 12:24 it says this this is the shift
[1:23:02] from Peter's Ministry to Paul's Ministry
[1:23:04] right now in chapter
[1:23:07] 12 but the word of God grew and
[1:23:11] multiplied and Barnabas and Saul
[1:23:14] returned from Jerusalem when they had
[1:23:16] filled their Ministry and took with them
[1:23:19] John whose surname was
[1:23:21] Mark now Chapter
[1:23:25] 13 Verse 38 and 39 Paul is preaching a
[1:23:30] sermon that's similar to that of Peter
[1:23:33] and Stephen where he brings Christ
[1:23:36] through the prophet's messages and he
[1:23:38] says this when I say the prophets
[1:23:40] messages I'm talking about all of the
[1:23:42] Old Testament prophets they use every
[1:23:46] sermon listen every sermon in the New
[1:23:48] Testament everyone is about Jesus can't
[1:23:51] find one that's not
[1:23:53] what they do is they take what the
[1:23:54] prophet said and they say here is the
[1:23:58] Fulfillment about the of that what the
[1:24:01] prophet said and it's this man Christ
[1:24:03] it's this man Jesus every
[1:24:07] sermon 1338 says
[1:24:11] this be it known Paul was preaching this
[1:24:13] sermon he says be it known unto you
[1:24:15] therefore men and Brethren that through
[1:24:17] this man is preached unto you
[1:24:19] forgiveness of sins and by him all that
[1:24:22] believe are Justified from all things
[1:24:25] from which you could not be justified by
[1:24:28] the law of
[1:24:30] Moses that's a
[1:24:32] mouthful for Paul to
[1:24:35] say you couldn't be justified through
[1:24:39] the law of Moses I know you kept all the
[1:24:41] Commandments you did all of this but
[1:24:42] there was no justification there you had
[1:24:45] to have a sacrifice and that
[1:24:49] lamb that animal that just sacrificed
[1:24:52] IED ain't good enough because you're a
[1:24:54] human being it had to be a human being
[1:24:58] that gave his life for this beware
[1:25:00] therefore lest that come upon you which
[1:25:03] was spoken of the in of in the prophets
[1:25:05] behold ye despisers and wonder and
[1:25:08] perish for I work a work in your days a
[1:25:11] work which ye shall in no wise
[1:25:14] believe though a man declared unto
[1:25:17] you we see the
[1:25:19] Fulfillment of the scriptures here where
[1:25:21] the Jews reject the message of
[1:25:24] Christ and this message now goes to the
[1:25:28] Gentiles and I'll close if the musicians
[1:25:31] would come verse
[1:25:33] 42 and when the Jews were gone out of
[1:25:36] the
[1:25:37] synagogue the Gentiles besought these
[1:25:41] words the Gentiles besought that these
[1:25:43] words might be preached to them the next
[1:25:46] Sabbath look at the
[1:25:48] hunger in these
[1:25:51] Gentiles is said wow this preaching of
[1:25:55] Jesus this preaching of a savior this is
[1:25:58] this is something that we need to have
[1:26:00] I'm a
[1:26:01] sinner I want to have this savior you're
[1:26:04] saying it doesn't have to be the Jews
[1:26:07] only I'm a sinner so I can come and I
[1:26:09] can receive the same thing as as these
[1:26:14] Jews now when the congregation was
[1:26:16] broken up many of the Jews and religious
[1:26:19] prelit followed Paul and Barnabas who
[1:26:22] speaking to them persuaded them to
[1:26:24] continue in the grace of God he wasn't
[1:26:26] trying to get them to leave their faith
[1:26:29] he wasn't trying to get them to leave
[1:26:30] their religion or the things that they
[1:26:33] lived by he wasn't trying to say hey you
[1:26:37] you you shouldn't be um keeping the
[1:26:40] Sabbath he wasn't saying that you
[1:26:43] shouldn't live holy he wasn't saying any
[1:26:45] of
[1:26:47] that and when the Jews were gone out of
[1:26:50] the synagogues I'm sorry
[1:26:52] verse verse 44 and the next Sabbath day
[1:26:58] came almost the whole city together to
[1:27:02] hear the word of
[1:27:04] God think about the Revival that was
[1:27:07] happening but when the Jews saw the
[1:27:09] multitudes they were filled with envy
[1:27:11] and spake against these those things
[1:27:14] which were spoken by Paul contradicting
[1:27:17] and
[1:27:18] blasphemy then Paul and Barnabas waxed
[1:27:21] bold and said it was necessary here is
[1:27:25] the
[1:27:27] pivotal Moment In the book of Acts it's
[1:27:31] a PIV it's a pivotal moment in
[1:27:33] history it starts 2,000
[1:27:38] years of the message going to the
[1:27:40] Gentiles
[1:27:47] us then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and
[1:27:50] said it was necessary that the the word
[1:27:52] of God should first have been spoken to
[1:27:56] you but seeing you put it from you and
[1:28:00] judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting
[1:28:03] life Lo we turn to the
[1:28:09] Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded
[1:28:12] us saying I have set thee to be a light
[1:28:15] of the Gentiles that thou should us be
[1:28:17] for salvation un the ends of the Earth
[1:28:20] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[1:28:23] were
[1:28:24] glad and glorified the word of the Lord
[1:28:27] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[1:28:30] life
[1:28:32] believed and the word of the Lord was
[1:28:35] published throughout all the
[1:28:40] region here we see that
[1:28:44] shift it started in the book of Acts
[1:28:47] they were preaching to the Jews in
[1:28:50] Jerusalem Jesus said it must must go to
[1:28:52] Jerusalem first then we see it spread
[1:28:56] out to the country of Israel in Judea
[1:28:59] with Peter and all the
[1:29:01] disciples and then now we see Paul says
[1:29:07] okay I tried I did my best but right
[1:29:11] here it says in the prophet's words that
[1:29:14] this would go to the Gentiles and we are
[1:29:18] turning now to the gentile people as I
[1:29:22] said it started a movement that has
[1:29:26] lasted into this
[1:29:27] day 2,000 years of a gentile
[1:29:31] dispensation very
[1:29:32] soon very very
[1:29:35] soon who knows we may be seeing
[1:29:38] something starting now in the Middle
[1:29:39] East that may lead to
[1:29:42] it I think about that and I think Lord I
[1:29:45] got it we got to get to
[1:29:47] work but it's
[1:29:49] promised that that message that was sent
[1:29:53] to us our
[1:29:56] people would go to the ones that were
[1:29:59] originally blinded these Jewish people
[1:30:02] and then that disp that Gentile
[1:30:04] dispensation dispensing the message to
[1:30:07] the gentile people will be
[1:30:09] over and the word will go back to the
[1:30:12] Jewish people it talks about a talks
[1:30:14] about a an olive
[1:30:15] tree talks about how that the tree is
[1:30:21] pruned
[1:30:23] off and a branch of a different type of
[1:30:28] olive tree of a of a wild ol tree one
[1:30:30] that couldn't be tamed that it was taken
[1:30:33] it was cut off and it was grafted in to
[1:30:37] that original that original tree and it
[1:30:40] started to grow and it's grown for 2,000
[1:30:43] years but it's promised that soon that
[1:30:47] that branch that that tree is going to
[1:30:50] put out its own branches
[1:30:52] and that is the meth message going back
[1:30:55] to the Jewish people and we're about to
[1:30:58] see it friends it's going to happen soon
[1:31:00] let's
[1:31:03] stand this book of Acts is
[1:31:07] tremendous we see the spirit of God and
[1:31:10] the disciples doing the same thing that
[1:31:12] Jesus did and we see the spirit of the
[1:31:15] devil doing the same thing that the high
[1:31:17] priest did with the same attitude and
[1:31:20] those Spirits all those people are gone
[1:31:23] but those Spirits are still here Among
[1:31:26] Us What Spirit do we have what Spirit do
[1:31:29] I
[1:31:31] have let's bow our
[1:31:35] heads brother Arie why don't you come in
[1:31:47] close I

[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:55] river that
[1:32:58] never
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:04] shall brothers and
[1:33:07] sisters going through the book of
[1:33:09] Acts like with everywhere in the
[1:33:12] Bible make sure you are
[1:33:16] relating to these people in the book of
[1:33:18] Acts and ask yourself what side would I
[1:33:21] have been on
[1:33:22] on in this crazy new
[1:33:25] message that's against everything that
[1:33:27] I've ever heard but it lines up
[1:33:29] perfectly with the
[1:33:31] word or digging
[1:33:34] in hating
[1:33:36] people not wanting to give an
[1:33:39] inch where would I have
[1:33:42] been we should always be checking
[1:33:44] ourselves Lord I want to stand on the
[1:33:46] right side of History I want to stand
[1:33:50] with none other than Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:33:52] himself brother
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:17] Arie pray with me please
[1:34:22] this
[1:34:23] is quite an appointment to be able to
[1:34:26] talk the creator that created this
[1:34:29] beautiful creation amen and I don't
[1:34:32] consider him a failure I don't believe
[1:34:34] anybody here does oh amen
[1:34:39] and I've had some amazing answers to
[1:34:42] prayer I've talked to
[1:34:45] people of all walks of life that had
[1:34:48] answers to
[1:34:50] prayer and sometimes they just break
[1:34:54] down with the memory Lord of
[1:34:58] you that hears us before the world was
[1:35:01] created see us standing here Lord and we
[1:35:05] can't say we're necessarily more fervent
[1:35:08] than anybody else or better than anybody
[1:35:11] else Lord but we're standing here in an
[1:35:15] unusual spot Lord we're an unusual
[1:35:20] man
[1:35:22] lived and proclaimed the same gospel
[1:35:27] that you you said he would
[1:35:30] restore and that's what I believe Lord
[1:35:32] and I I believe these people here
[1:35:34] believe it too and we just want to
[1:35:36] surrender to you and ask you to fill us
[1:35:40] you you did say this that of a father
[1:35:42] would give good
[1:35:45] things to his children how much more
[1:35:47] would he
[1:35:48] give his Spirit the same SP
[1:35:52] spirit that you have
[1:35:55] it's almost unbelievable that you are
[1:36:00] that powerful you said he would send
[1:36:03] power from on high to those people and
[1:36:07] here we are standing thousands 2,000
[1:36:10] years
[1:36:12] later in this great time of all the
[1:36:15] prophetic utterances that are being
[1:36:17] fulfilled now Lord we just thank you for
[1:36:21] this opportunity to ask you and each one
[1:36:25] of us Lord he's talking about prayer and
[1:36:28] how the people even doubted their own
[1:36:31] prayers when Peter was in prison but
[1:36:33] Lord I've forgotten my prayers and you
[1:36:37] still answered them Lord I just thank
[1:36:40] you and I I ask you to forgive me now
[1:36:43] and forgive anybody here Lord that wants
[1:36:46] it and maybe even doesn't want it Lord
[1:36:49] but I just know there's got to be
[1:36:50] something to is real powerful that could
[1:36:53] come and give everybody a chance you
[1:36:55] said that the greatest Mercy would come
[1:36:57] before the greatest judgment and so I
[1:36:59] just thank you for this opportunity to
[1:37:01] come together with
[1:37:03] Believers in Jesus Christ's name I don't
[1:37:05] want to overdo it Lord but I just wanted
[1:37:08] to join like
[1:37:10] brother Evan said that we could
[1:37:15] pray all night they were praying Lord so
[1:37:19] I just would like to continue with
[1:37:21] prayer

[1:40:19] that said my sins can be
[1:40:22] forgiven I want my sins
[1:40:26] forgiven there are
[1:40:29] many but through the blood of Jesus
[1:40:32] Christ and him crucified our sins can be
[1:40:37] forgiven if we will accept that pardon
[1:40:41] it's the most important thing in the
[1:40:43] [Music]
