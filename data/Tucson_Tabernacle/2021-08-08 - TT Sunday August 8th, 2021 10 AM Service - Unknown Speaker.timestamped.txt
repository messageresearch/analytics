[2:12] broken so
[2:13] we're struggling through things this
[2:14] morning and but i appreciate these

[2:20] spearheaded it and said hey let's do
[2:22] this
[2:23] he nominated his son to narrow down what
[2:25] we were going to buy and
[2:27] then everybody helped put it together
[2:28] but ed did a lot of effort
[2:31] getting the scissor lift in and i guess
[2:32] some of you probably came through the
[2:33] front lobby and saw the scissor lift in
[2:35] the
[2:36] front lobby still there but um we had to
[2:38] get a forklift to get it up the steps
[2:39] etc but there's a little bit of
[2:41] challenges but
[2:42] i'm afraid i'm thankful for all these
[2:44] brothers and all the different ones that
[2:45] help their
[2:46] their wives that support them and allow
[2:49] them to come down and help us

[31:09] but something that enoch had in his
[31:11] heart something that enoch believed
[31:13] something that
[31:14] that caused enoch to get up and walk

[31:33] planning our next few days our next few
[31:35] weeks our next few years and there's
[31:37] nothing wrong with that but sometimes
[31:38] maybe there's
[31:39] too much planning on that
[31:42] but maybe one morning wake up could this
[31:44] this be the day lord
[31:46] that i'm walking with you and you just
[31:48] say come on home
[31:51] i would i would want that to be soon and
[31:53] very soon
[31:54] so we know the things that are going on
[31:58] there's been
[31:59] some of the announcements made and
[32:03] some of some of the churches in in this
[32:05] whole world and
[32:06] some of the folks that we know some of
[32:08] the names we've heard
[32:11] that have had gone on to be with the
[32:13] lord
[32:14] and there are families today that are
[32:17] are missing their loved ones
[32:20] but we have a hope that soon and very
[32:24] soon
[32:26] brother branham said and brother green
[32:27] would always remind us he says one of
[32:29] these days you'll see your loved ones
[32:31] as they come close and you know we're
[32:33] going home soon
[32:35] what a day that'll be i i was
[32:39] just some different thoughts over the
[32:40] last few days and
[32:42] maybe the middle of last week just on
[32:45] expectations what what are we desiring
[32:47] what are we looking forward to what is
[32:50] what is our hope what is our
[32:51] anticipation um
[32:54] and it's it's amazing how
[32:58] you you get some some news some
[33:02] something maybe and and it changes your
[33:05] whole thought pattern your
[33:06] your your feelings and all
[33:10] and then you get past that and you look
[33:13] back and you say well it wasn't that bad
[33:14] after all
[33:16] but before you get to there you're kind
[33:17] of nervous about it and
[33:20] you can ask my girls if there's
[33:22] something that's
[33:23] to do with upgrading the phone or the
[33:26] computer or something like that
[33:29] i get lost real quick i know how to turn
[33:31] it on and off
[33:32] not a whole lot more so this past
[33:35] week the all of the service technicians
[33:38] from the company i work with were all
[33:40] salaried employees
[33:42] and they change us all to hourly
[33:46] one of the biggest reasons because
[33:48] there's been a lot of overtime
[33:50] especially up in the phoenix area a lot
[33:52] of the guys have been working
[33:53] 10 12 hours over time a week so they
[33:55] said we'll we'll do this and
[33:58] and um so now we have to do our own
[34:02] time payroll on the computer
[34:05] and i thank god i have nailed me because
[34:08] i get nervous with it i get
[34:10] and it just seems like i can never make
[34:12] it come out right and then so she shows
[34:14] me again
[34:14] and she shows me again and then she
[34:18] gets his look are you ever going to
[34:19] learn that
[34:21] and i said oh we will maybe 50 times
[34:23] down the road but once you understand it
[34:25] and you go on
[34:27] and you look back at it you go well it
[34:28] wasn't that hard after all
[34:30] it was just this area up here you know
[34:34] but it just made me think and just
[34:35] thinking about this some of the things
[34:37] that
[34:38] we get uh nervous about we get worried
[34:41] about we get troubled about
[34:42] and and in this world that's not hard to
[34:44] do
[34:46] you hear this side
[34:49] my boss on one side and my co-worker on
[34:51] the other side my boss is wondering why
[34:54] not everybody in the world has been
[34:56] vaccinated and my co-worker on this side
[34:58] he said you're crazy if you get
[34:59] vaccinated and i hear both sides of it
[35:01] all day
[35:03] but i have a confidence in god
[35:07] because i can't have confidence in
[35:08] myself or anything else
[35:12] but he said i sent my word and
[35:15] heal all your disease i'm going to stand
[35:18] on that
[35:19] now we never had different conversations
[35:21] would you would you take the vaccine i
[35:23] said
[35:24] i believe if i i would if the lord told
[35:26] me to do it i wouldn't fear it that way
[35:28] because god watches over us but neither
[35:31] am i going to live in fear if i don't
[35:33] because god still watches over us
[35:36] and that's my hope that's my expectation
[35:40] that that and as i was i was doing that
[35:42] going over this and we were in in
[35:44] flagstaff
[35:45] last sunday or over the weekend should i
[35:48] say for the meetings and
[35:50] brother daryl ward was supposed to
[35:52] minister on
[35:54] on friday but because of covid in in
[35:57] back in tennessee he was under
[35:58] quarantine and couldn't come out
[36:01] so they had a brother come up from um
[36:04] phoenix brother armando who who spoke
[36:07] good english but with a strong accent
[36:09] but
[36:09] he made himself well understood
[36:12] and he just took the thought remember
[36:16] when when things get hard and you get
[36:18] frustrated you wonder what's going on
[36:20] remember what god has done for you how
[36:23] he's taken you out how he's brought you
[36:24] through a situation
[36:26] where he's lifted you up from where you
[36:28] are today from where you used to be
[36:30] and re-encourage yourself and he
[36:32] finished
[36:33] his his sermon as he was finishing up he
[36:35] was talking about the angel of the lord
[36:37] it still
[36:38] is here today and how they watch over us
[36:42] he was he was driving a tractor
[36:44] doing some work and and i don't know if
[36:47] it was a lawnmower or what
[36:49] but his three-year-old grandson had come
[36:51] walking up and he didn't know
[36:54] and something just told him to stop
[36:57] and when he stopped and turned his
[36:58] grandson was right there and he would
[37:00] have run over his grandson
[37:02] but see god is still god he's still
[37:05] mindful he still knows how to take care
[37:07] of his children
[37:08] and i really appreciated that and then
[37:10] on saturday brother samuel browning
[37:12] ministered
[37:14] and he talked about interruptions
[37:17] took the the thought interruption taking
[37:20] it out of the sixth hill and things of
[37:22] brother
[37:22] graham's but how god will interrupt your
[37:25] life
[37:26] and what you think is an interruption
[37:30] but god says i'm going to stop or
[37:32] interrupt you here because there is
[37:33] something that has to change
[37:35] something and you look back at that
[37:37] interruption now and you say thank god
[37:39] that he came in and he interrupted me
[37:43] and it was such a blessing to to to hear
[37:46] that to understand those are things that
[37:48] god has done in our life and then
[37:50] he ministered again on sunday
[37:53] and he took the 50th year the jubilee
[37:56] year
[37:58] and two things that he said and that
[38:00] just really stood out with me and
[38:02] some of these things you may hear a
[38:04] hundred times but just one day clicks
[38:06] one day it seems to come together so
[38:09] he was talking about the priest
[38:13] when they offered that sacrifice to be
[38:15] accepted by god and they stood outside
[38:17] the temple
[38:18] and when that smoke came up and they
[38:20] realized the sacrifice had been accepted
[38:23] and they had another year their sins
[38:26] were covered
[38:28] so he was talking about that
[38:31] to come out and that praise it was his
[38:33] his job to go out and sound the trumpet
[38:35] of the jubilee year
[38:36] the setting free of the people your
[38:38] liberty was coming
[38:40] but you didn't see the sacrifice you
[38:43] weren't there
[38:45] but the priest was sent out to blow the
[38:46] trumpet
[38:48] and you had to believe that the priest
[38:51] had witnessed it
[38:52] and when he blew the trumpet you could
[38:54] go free
[38:56] you had to believe that you couldn't get
[38:58] there and begin to question really was
[39:00] he there was he not you had to say
[39:02] this is i'm i can walk away
[39:05] from that which has has me bound
[39:08] and he and i really appreciate it
[39:10] because he said jesus christ
[39:12] that day on calvary that sacrifice
[39:16] was accepted
[39:19] maybe i'll just take this off
[39:26] jesus christ is the accepted sacrifice
[39:30] of god
[39:31] for mine in your jubilee
[39:34] and there had to come a messenger in
[39:36] this day
[39:38] to tell us he's done it it's been
[39:41] accepted
[39:42] it's a finished work but now it's in
[39:45] your hands
[39:46] what do you do with it do you accept and
[39:49] say yes lord i accept my jubilee
[39:51] i'll throw that which has had me bound
[39:54] here
[39:54] that which has me working over here i'll
[39:56] throw it down and i'll go take the
[39:57] promise
[39:58] that which belongs to me and walk in
[40:00] that
[40:01] and he said one more thing and and just
[40:03] uh there was a lot of things but these
[40:05] were just just spoke to me
[40:07] as he was ministering and he talked
[40:10] about
[40:11] and if you know a couple wins he goes we
[40:13] we we had heard that message
[40:15] brother branham is singing he careth and
[40:17] he begins to talk
[40:19] to the congregation well you say my
[40:20] daughter this you say my son this he
[40:22] said but he cares he cares for you
[40:25] and he said so your son is is a
[40:28] homosexual
[40:29] your daughter is a lesbian your husband
[40:32] is a drunk and he
[40:33] and he goes you say it in a way that it
[40:36] sounds like
[40:37] there's nothing you can do about it he
[40:40] said
[40:40] god is greater than that
[40:43] he's bigger than that situation
[40:47] and he can change it and he went out of
[40:49] the prodigal son
[40:50] and we get to look at how that that
[40:52] young boy was living
[40:54] but his heart said i want to go back to
[40:57] my father's house
[40:59] and he began to go back now the story
[41:01] doesn't tell us the thought process
[41:03] of that young man and the father except
[41:05] that the father was
[41:06] looking every day for him until the sun
[41:09] is getting home and
[41:10] he begins to say i'm just going to tell
[41:12] my father i'm not worthy to be your son
[41:14] again
[41:15] just make me a servant
[41:19] but the father had a whole different
[41:21] thought whole different plan in mind
[41:23] that is my son coming back
[41:27] i'm glad that when he looks at me and
[41:29] you and he said those are my children
[41:33] those are the ones that i died for those
[41:35] were the ones that i shed
[41:37] my blood for and therefore they're my
[41:39] children
[41:40] welcome thou into the joy of the lord
[41:42] with no exceptions
[41:45] and it just it it i had had gone i even
[41:48] mentioned this to my wife i think we
[41:49] were driving up on thursday
[41:51] the thought of an an anticipation a hope
[41:54] or an expectation
[41:57] what what are we expecting what is my
[41:59] desire
[42:01] but beyond that is who is the god of my
[42:04] expectations
[42:07] who is the one that has already said try
[42:09] me
[42:11] ask me see if i can't do
[42:16] what you desire so
[42:20] yesterday i just looked up the word
[42:22] expectations every once in a while you
[42:23] get a different definition maybe
[42:25] something you hadn't thought of
[42:27] but there was a bunch of quotes in
[42:31] written by by different people so i
[42:34] started reading some of them
[42:37] and boy did i have great expectations
[42:40] after that
[42:42] to realize the opposite of god
[42:46] what god has said and what god is to
[42:47] what people think
[42:51] so i'm going to just just entitle this
[42:54] first part or the for just three of them
[42:57] the human thought and as human
[43:00] expectations
[43:02] are premeditated resentments
[43:05] and that caught my attention what do
[43:07] they mean by that
[43:09] so i read the little article they went
[43:10] with it and it was a lady who
[43:13] was going to do something for her best
[43:15] friend and she began to plant
[43:17] her birthday party i'm going to do this
[43:21] i'm going to do this i know she likes
[43:23] this she's going to be so happy she's
[43:25] going to be
[43:26] so excited and she made all these plans
[43:28] got everything laid up
[43:30] birthday party came up her friend comes
[43:33] in and her friend looks around and she's
[43:35] happy about what she's done
[43:38] and she's grateful and all you know but
[43:40] it didn't meet
[43:41] the expectation of the person that
[43:45] prepared it because she thought she'll
[43:47] be a lot more happier
[43:49] and this is her she says human
[43:51] expectation
[43:52] are just premeditated resentments you
[43:55] planned it all
[43:56] out then you resent it
[44:00] when you have expectations you are
[44:02] setting yourself up
[44:03] for disappointments quite even said
[44:07] lower your expectations and you won't be
[44:09] so disappointed
[44:10] i know i've put my expectations in a god
[44:13] who never fails and i can't
[44:17] i don't even think i can have enough
[44:19] expectation to meet what's here
[44:22] because it's it's eternal when you have
[44:25] expectations you are setting yourself up
[44:28] for disappointments i
[44:31] started to realize telling my wife and
[44:32] somebody i said listen to some of this
[44:35] no wonder the world is in the condition
[44:37] it is when you have expectations
[44:41] you are setting you're i'm sorry i read
[44:42] the wrong never get attached to someone
[44:45] because attachments lead to expectations
[44:48] and expectations lead to disappointments
[44:53] and some of us or all of us could say
[44:54] that's true
[44:56] we have been disappointed we have been
[44:58] uh
[44:59] we felt we've been failed at times by
[45:01] someone or something
[45:05] but i'll title this one god
[45:08] there's somebody who's got your best
[45:10] interest as his focus
[45:12] there's somebody who wants you to win
[45:15] there is a father who wants you to
[45:17] overcome he wants you to wear the
[45:19] victor's crown of life
[45:21] because he loves you if you have been
[45:24] failed in life
[45:25] you're not alone you have got to
[45:27] remember
[45:28] he is not your earthly father nor your
[45:31] mentor
[45:32] nor your earthly teacher nor your pastor
[45:36] he is the one who knew you before you
[45:38] were ever formed in your mother's womb
[45:41] and saw exact in you exactly what it was
[45:43] going to take to reach his plans
[45:47] for you he looked and he said
[45:51] yes they will be on this side
[45:56] and i will make sure that's god's
[45:58] thought that's god's act
[45:59] so when you put your expectation on what
[46:01] god said
[46:02] in god's word and there is an expected
[46:06] end
[46:08] like enoch and that's why i put enoch in
[46:10] there go enoch walk with god
[46:12] for a reason his desire was to be with
[46:14] god to love god
[46:16] and god loved it so much he said just
[46:17] come on home enoch
[46:20] that should be our hope that should be
[46:21] our expectation that desire
[46:24] lord this world is not my home
[46:27] while i'm here i will do the best i can
[46:30] to live as a christian
[46:31] i will do the best i can to help my my
[46:34] fellow man i'll be a a person that is
[46:37] not just uh just walking through life
[46:40] with no care for nobody else but this
[46:42] life is not my hope
[46:43] this life is not my ambition but rather
[46:47] the other one that's my heart's desire
[46:52] i have some quotes here and
[46:56] i was going to eliminate some of them
[46:57] but then you read them and you say how
[46:59] can i
[46:59] eliminate that one so we'll take a few
[47:02] moments too
[47:03] and you should be able to read them now
[47:06] with me
[47:08] so i'll tell you what i'll let them put
[47:11] them up you just read it and i'll just
[47:12] wait till you're all done
[47:13] tell me when you're done reading no
[47:15] we'll do this together
[47:17] we'll take that first quote awakening
[47:19] jesus
[47:21] if you you have them there
[47:30] okay well just go ahead and start
[47:32] reading then he said
[47:35] and this was called and i'm just going
[47:37] to say the right mental attitude
[47:40] i'm sorry this one i didn't give you so
[47:42] you won't have this one because this one
[47:43] i got after and from awakening jesus he
[47:48] said
[47:48] the man was to be in brother and he said
[47:50] brother brown and we have a record
[47:52] that when it's from a doctor when we
[47:55] tell a person that's got a malignancy or
[47:56] something that's going to kill him
[47:58] an ulcer ready to burst or tubercular it
[48:01] depends on what attitude they take
[48:04] if they get all tore up they die right
[48:06] away but if they take the added
[48:08] attitude well dying is just part of
[48:10] living
[48:11] it's all right when i die and you know
[48:14] it's almost retards that case
[48:17] brother brahm says i just thought it's
[48:19] that mental attitude
[48:20] taken like that that will do it when the
[48:23] holy spirit strikes the inner man there
[48:25] it is
[48:26] i asked him he said certainly that's
[48:27] right
[48:29] if you can move into a spot move up to
[48:31] into that
[48:32] one of the best surgeons and doctors
[48:34] there is in southland he said
[48:36] mr branham it can be proved if a man
[48:39] will move can move up into that spot
[48:41] until even his own mind doesn't even
[48:43] know he's got it
[48:44] to think he's got it and don't even pay
[48:47] any attention
[48:48] to it it wouldn't do it if he can
[48:50] believe that that's a doctor speaking
[48:52] that's true see the mental attitude you
[48:54] take towards it will bring
[48:56] now the mind won't do it but if you give
[48:59] that attitude
[49:00] towards something that's got life in it
[49:02] then that life comes down and does it
[49:05] not your mental attitude that only
[49:07] brings you in the presence of him
[49:09] that's what you do your mind the five
[49:12] senses
[49:12] is all right as long as they don't deny
[49:15] god but when they
[49:16] go tonight denying god then you leave
[49:18] them alone
[49:19] god controls them that's a creator when
[49:22] you take your thoughts
[49:24] and you begin to focus among god's word
[49:28] this is what god said this is what god
[49:31] said the word of god
[49:32] says this and you quit paying attention
[49:35] to the symptoms
[49:37] which is hard to do i think everybody
[49:40] can raise their arms and testify it's
[49:42] hard to do at times
[49:43] you begin to feel the pain you begin to
[49:45] see i woke up about 1 30 this morning
[49:48] and
[49:50] my wife said what's wrong i said i don't
[49:51] know i'm going to check my blood sugar
[49:53] maybe something's off there that was
[49:54] okay
[49:55] my whole left side was just kind of numb
[49:57] and tingling and i'm like what's going
[49:59] on and
[50:00] the first thing you do is start to get
[50:01] nervous and get worried could it be this
[50:03] could it be that
[50:04] you know and then i said i'm just going
[50:06] to go over to the living room i'm going
[50:07] to lay down on the couch and
[50:09] maybe it'll be all right and i fell
[50:10] asleep and i woke up fine this morning
[50:13] or i could have stayed up all night
[50:15] worried about it
[50:17] now i know sometimes people are
[50:20] different
[50:20] there are people that wake up in the
[50:22] morning thinking what's going to happen
[50:24] to me today what's going to go wrong
[50:25] what's going to go wrong
[50:27] and there are other people who get up in
[50:28] the morning said let's go out and face
[50:29] every challenge
[50:32] and that's the difference in people but
[50:34] but the word of god tells us
[50:37] that he watches over us he cares for us
[50:40] he plans our day he's got he's got
[50:43] the best in mind for you
[50:46] if you get up in the morning he said my
[50:48] symptoms are this but god's word says
[50:51] that and i'm going to stand on that
[50:54] so brother branham again tells us that
[50:57] right mental attitude
[51:00] god's god's word never fails
[51:06] all right now i don't know if you have
[51:08] the quotes here but these i did give to
[51:10] you
[51:11] okay from the 10 virgins
[51:15] and 104 and this is going back to enoch
[51:18] here so enoch just kept walking in the
[51:20] light
[51:21] so one day he felt his feet getting off
[51:23] the ground he just kept walking and he
[51:25] walked into glory
[51:27] on into glory without even dying that's
[51:29] right
[51:30] god took him away because he was walking
[51:32] in the light
[51:33] with a testimony that he walked in the
[51:36] light of god
[51:37] keep walking walking
[51:40] it's one thing to walk it's another
[51:42] thing to walk with the right purpose
[51:45] with the right motive whether you could
[51:47] walk and be going the wrong way
[51:50] okay so i'm going to go to town and i'm
[51:53] coming from marana
[51:54] we would say going south even though
[51:56] i-10 is east
[51:57] but if i turn north and start walking
[51:59] north
[52:00] towards phoenix i'm not going to get to
[52:03] do something
[52:04] but i'm walking but if you have a
[52:07] purpose
[52:08] you have a place you have something
[52:10] which is god's word
[52:12] you walk towards that you walk towards
[52:14] what god said
[52:18] show us the father and hit and it will
[52:19] suffice us
[52:22] and when we take a promise of god drop
[52:24] it into our heart
[52:25] we keep watering it with faith and it
[52:27] keeps pushing out pushing out
[52:29] hallelujah when christ is planted in our
[52:32] heart the holy ghost
[52:34] the only thing we do is drink in the
[52:37] word of god
[52:38] and it pushes out salvation it pushes
[52:40] out divine healing
[52:42] it pushes out glory it pushes out
[52:44] everything that we have need of
[52:47] is right in us when we have when we are
[52:50] planted in christ jesus this is
[52:52] and then he says here's my
[52:53] interpretation of him about being the
[52:56] water he is the inexhaustible
[52:58] fountain of life you'll never ask him
[53:01] too much you can never believe him for
[53:03] too great a thing he delights in you
[53:06] believing him for great things you can
[53:08] never overdo it
[53:11] lord i think i've bothered you enough
[53:13] today i think i've asked you too much
[53:15] no it pleases him when you go up to say
[53:19] father
[53:20] he says yes because it's he's a fountain
[53:22] of life
[53:24] and when you turn on the fountain what
[53:25] does it do it just continually
[53:27] continually
[53:28] continually he's eternal he's never shut
[53:31] off
[53:34] the next quote
[53:37] inspiration that a double portion of
[53:41] your spirit
[53:42] be sent upon me we know that was elijah
[53:44] elisha asking of elijah
[53:46] said you've asked a great thing god
[53:48] wants us to ask for big things
[53:50] my god he don't run out of blessings up
[53:53] there you can't ask for too much
[53:55] he says could you imagine a little fish
[53:57] about that long out in the middle of the
[53:58] ocean saying
[54:00] i'd better not drink much of this water
[54:02] because it might go dry
[54:04] well that's just as unreasonable as it
[54:07] would be
[54:07] or more so reasonable than to be
[54:11] to be to think that god's blessings
[54:13] would ever be exhausted to a believer
[54:16] because all heaven belongs to you
[54:18] brother branham says there's a better
[54:19] chance of the fish
[54:20] using up all the water in the ocean that
[54:22] one little fish then you're exhausting
[54:24] god's blessings
[54:26] you ever looked at it that way of all
[54:30] the ocean this little fish is out there
[54:31] and he says i got to take it easy
[54:32] because i could dry up the hole he goes
[54:34] there's a better chance of that
[54:35] happening
[54:36] than god being exhausted amen
[54:39] where pentecost where i think pentecost
[54:41] failed
[54:43] and god will never you can never exhaust
[54:46] god's love and mercy to you
[54:48] and sometimes i think we try hard don't
[54:50] we
[54:52] lord i've done it again i failed you
[54:54] again i've
[54:55] but god says hey this is the first time
[54:56] because i've forgiven you i've cleaned
[54:58] it
[54:59] you know it's just hard for us to
[55:01] imagine that sometimes
[55:03] well i hate to bother you so much father
[55:06] he wants to be bothered that way he does
[55:08] don't ever think that you could ever ask
[55:10] too much of god
[55:12] i believe the scripture said you have
[55:14] not because you ask
[55:15] not and you ask not because you believe
[55:18] not
[55:19] he wants us to ask and believe that our
[55:21] joys would be full he wants you to ask
[55:23] abundantly
[55:24] ask for big things don't limit your
[55:26] faith to some little mustard seed
[55:29] get out there here to some other kind of
[55:32] faith
[55:33] and move out in big things ass big
[55:35] things is just
[55:36] as easy to receive as little things
[55:41] and sometimes they say oh no lord i'm
[55:43] going to bother you that's too much no
[55:44] no no
[55:46] if it's it's um something that that
[55:49] i told my wife made me just a little
[55:51] jealous yesterday
[55:53] just a little honest my son-in-law amos
[55:57] was
[55:58] took the the backhoe the company back
[56:00] out of the yard because they're going to
[56:01] be doing some work
[56:04] and he was he was using it uh to to dig
[56:07] out the foundations
[56:09] and my little grandson amos three i mean
[56:12] asher three years old
[56:13] is sitting on amos's lap and operating
[56:16] the levers
[56:18] and i've always wanted to do that
[56:22] and i never have and he's three years
[56:24] old he got to do it
[56:25] well he's got a little excavator that he
[56:28] sits on himself they bought it for him
[56:29] and has two handles and he's always
[56:31] moving the sand around
[56:33] and i'm just too big to sit on that one
[56:36] i told my my wife i said i'm a little
[56:38] jealous because he finally got to do it
[56:40] he's three years old and he's on a
[56:41] full-size tractor and aimlesses letting
[56:44] him operate the levers but you know
[56:47] you're god's children and he says ask
[56:51] it's yours do it it pleases the father
[56:56] if
[56:56] if you could see amos face to see him
[56:58] having
[56:59] uh asher sitting on his laps and doing
[57:02] amos is my son is going to be able to do
[57:04] what i can do there's a there was a joy
[57:06] in that
[57:08] on my end there was a little jealousy in
[57:10] it
[57:12] it pleased my heart to see god see to
[57:15] see that happening
[57:16] that here's the father with his son and
[57:18] it's pleasing the father
[57:20] to have his son do that i wonder how
[57:22] much more it pleases god
[57:25] when his children will take him at his
[57:26] word and stand on it and walk on it
[57:29] and put it to use god you said so
[57:32] therefore i'm just going to put it to
[57:34] use
[57:36] it doesn't do you any good in the drawer
[57:40] it doesn't do you any good in god's
[57:42] medicine cabinet
[57:44] take it in a pile put it to use
[57:53] and be not afraid it is i
[57:58] i really like this i would like to ask
[57:59] the scientist teacher of
[58:01] of this school or whatever school
[58:04] what kind of atom did he turn loose not
[58:07] wheat but wheat growed
[58:09] milled shortened baked and ready to eat
[58:12] what did he do and when he broke those
[58:14] fishes
[58:15] a fish sired born raised scaled cleaned
[58:18] and fried
[58:19] and was there a second when he reached
[58:21] for it what did he do
[58:23] and when they taken five biscuits and
[58:25] fed five thousand people off five
[58:27] biscuits and took up baskets full
[58:29] i can hear young john say that took out
[58:34] took all of the doubt away from me
[58:35] because i remember that my jewish mother
[58:38] used to tell me this is them
[58:39] in the boat the disciples having having
[58:42] a
[58:43] a a testimony service oh i can remember
[58:45] her pretty
[58:46] big brown eyes looking at me saying john
[58:48] my son i want to speak to you
[58:51] of something that's real that'll mean
[58:53] something to you someday
[58:55] of all you can ever do john my ambition
[58:58] is for you to be something great
[59:00] but above all things i want you to be a
[59:02] believer in jehovah
[59:04] as i and your father are and are trying
[59:07] to raise you
[59:08] and i remember as a little boy when my
[59:10] little eyes would look up to hers and
[59:12] she'd say
[59:12] john when god jehovah brought his people
[59:14] out of egypt out into the wilderness
[59:17] where they had nothing to eat jehovah
[59:19] rained down bread out of heaven every
[59:21] night and fed all his children
[59:23] and brethren in this testimony meeting i
[59:25] would ask my mother
[59:27] mother has god got a whole lot of angels
[59:29] it's professional bakers
[59:31] and he's got a great big skype they're
[59:33] full of ovens and every night he'd bake
[59:35] that bread and bring it down by the
[59:36] angels
[59:37] and lay it all out on the ground is that
[59:38] the way he done it mama
[59:40] she say no john you're just a little boy
[59:43] you do not understand
[59:44] jehovah is a creator he just spoke the
[59:48] word
[59:48] and the bread came down let me ask you a
[59:52] question has he changed
[59:54] is he any different is he still jehovah
[59:57] god
[59:58] your provider then it's us sometimes
[1:00:08] so again expectations
[1:00:12] what are you expecting what are you
[1:00:13] desiring what is it
[1:00:16] he said well you know i would like to to
[1:00:18] accomplish this in life i would
[1:00:20] maybe like to go on to school or college
[1:00:23] or go to university and
[1:00:25] and prepare a career or get prepared for
[1:00:29] a career and and i believe that
[1:00:32] a person should make plans a person
[1:00:34] should have something in their life to
[1:00:35] push
[1:00:35] to look forward to that motivate you to
[1:00:37] get up every day and go forward
[1:00:40] because when you don't have some it's
[1:00:42] just easy to do nothing
[1:00:44] but well there's something that gets you
[1:00:46] to go and and um
[1:00:49] sometimes it's the things that we've
[1:00:51] caused ourselves that we got to get up
[1:00:53] every day and go to work because
[1:00:54] we got ourselves in a little debt a
[1:00:55] little bit of trouble
[1:00:57] and now we're motivated to get up or the
[1:00:59] debt collector comes and
[1:01:01] gets us but let it be better than that
[1:01:03] let it be greater than that let it be
[1:01:05] more than that
[1:01:06] lord i want to dedicate my life to
[1:01:09] serving you to letting this light that
[1:01:12] you've placed in me
[1:01:13] shine for the world to see whether it's
[1:01:17] at a job whether it's at school whether
[1:01:19] it's in my neighborhood or whatever you
[1:01:21] desire for me
[1:01:23] i want to press towards that and put
[1:01:25] that out before it's just something to
[1:01:27] to look forward to something to press
[1:01:28] forward to
[1:01:31] and and and again with an expectation
[1:01:36] but human expectation can fail you
[1:01:39] it has uh people that have gone uh
[1:01:42] if you watched or saw any of the
[1:01:46] of any of the olympics going on the best
[1:01:49] of the best
[1:01:50] pretty well made it to the olympics
[1:01:52] there was probably a few others that
[1:01:53] maybe
[1:01:55] did that last second win and normally
[1:01:57] they lost but they won they got to make
[1:01:59] it that
[1:01:59] does happen sometimes but their
[1:02:02] expectation
[1:02:04] there was some probably their
[1:02:05] expectation was to get to the olympics
[1:02:08] and they got that far but for for most
[1:02:11] of me
[1:02:11] was to come home with a gold medal that
[1:02:14] was the
[1:02:15] the the idea it wasn't just to get there
[1:02:20] but to come home and so i i watched a
[1:02:22] video clip of the joy of the the
[1:02:24] expression of the tears of those that
[1:02:26] had gotten to the gold medal
[1:02:30] from from some who stood there and and
[1:02:32] and basically glory
[1:02:34] in themselves to the team from
[1:02:37] fiji that won the gold medal who got on
[1:02:40] their knees
[1:02:41] and praised god in the front of the
[1:02:42] whole world
[1:02:45] and saying we have overcome by the blood
[1:02:47] of the lamb
[1:02:49] what a difference i was shocked to see
[1:02:51] it it said
[1:02:52] it was a little clip that said see watch
[1:02:54] this
[1:02:56] they sang and worshiped god for allowing
[1:02:58] them to win
[1:03:01] one of these days you and i will bow at
[1:03:04] his throne
[1:03:05] and worship him and thank him
[1:03:09] more than a gold medal but eternal life
[1:03:14] but to see that it blessed my heart but
[1:03:17] the joy of those people to to um
[1:03:20] to get the one of the the i think he
[1:03:22] took silver medal on the
[1:03:24] bmx bikes that did all the things my
[1:03:27] daughter
[1:03:28] sarah's one of her caretakers that was
[1:03:30] his brother
[1:03:32] he has competed worldwide many a times
[1:03:36] but he took a silver and it's kind of
[1:03:38] like
[1:03:39] i almost know him not really
[1:03:42] but there's a little bit of pride that
[1:03:43] goes with it hey i know his brother
[1:03:46] you know something about but you know
[1:03:48] what
[1:03:49] i'm glad i know the children of god i
[1:03:51] haven't know my family here
[1:03:53] and together i'm gonna get to go with
[1:03:56] him to the other side
[1:03:57] and together we're going to get to
[1:03:59] worship him together and say we have
[1:04:01] overcome
[1:04:02] by the blood of the lamb it's it's
[1:04:05] just motivate yourself with those type
[1:04:08] of thoughts those things
[1:04:09] something else that happened in just
[1:04:12] god's been so good
[1:04:13] what can i say working um i think it was
[1:04:17] wednesday working in a house
[1:04:19] the superintendent there a young man
[1:04:21] named carlos
[1:04:23] who had just recently met became a
[1:04:25] superintendent for the builder and
[1:04:27] we were talking everything that was on
[1:04:29] up
[1:04:30] that was on a friday and that saturday
[1:04:33] was the
[1:04:34] memorial service for sister annie bustos
[1:04:36] myself and my wife come walking in the
[1:04:38] door
[1:04:39] and carlos walks right in the other door
[1:04:40] at the same time
[1:04:42] and he looks at me says aaron what are
[1:04:44] you doing here and i'm looking saying
[1:04:45] what are you doing here
[1:04:46] he goes i married one of the boosters
[1:04:50] and it changed our whole relationship
[1:04:55] i'm still aaron the service guy
[1:04:58] but there's a friendliness uh something
[1:05:00] that's different there now
[1:05:02] i've heard him kind of get upset at some
[1:05:04] of the other guys and he treats me a
[1:05:05] little bit different
[1:05:06] i didn't do anything to serve it we just
[1:05:08] happened to be friends with the same
[1:05:10] family
[1:05:11] but i appreciate god being merciful but
[1:05:14] good that way
[1:05:16] working up at saddlebrook and i went to
[1:05:18] speak to the head manager of the or the
[1:05:20] construction manager and i told him i
[1:05:22] was going to take a week off because i
[1:05:24] was supposed to go to
[1:05:25] south america with brother greene and my
[1:05:27] father and them
[1:05:29] and he said for what reason are you
[1:05:30] leaving i said well i may be going on a
[1:05:33] little missionary trip and he said what
[1:05:35] church
[1:05:35] and i said non-denominational christian
[1:05:38] church
[1:05:39] what's the name of it and i said tucson
[1:05:41] tabernacle and he said oh brother green
[1:05:44] and i look at him like who are you he
[1:05:47] says i'm brother chuck levin he says
[1:05:49] brother green married me and my wife and
[1:05:52] the next words
[1:05:53] i didn't go in there for that reason i
[1:05:54] just went to tell them he said you're a
[1:05:56] brother if you have any problems here
[1:05:58] you come and tell me i'll take care of
[1:05:59] it
[1:06:01] oh i said lord you're you've got it all
[1:06:03] covered
[1:06:05] brother randy lunsford brother matthew
[1:06:08] watkins
[1:06:08] um father-in-law was working there too
[1:06:10] so i had two brothers too
[1:06:12] brother steve hickerson lord provides
[1:06:15] god meets he takes care of things for us
[1:06:18] and i appreciate that
[1:06:20] so our our hope our expectation is not
[1:06:24] based
[1:06:25] merely on our hope and our expectation
[1:06:27] but on the god that supplies are all our
[1:06:29] needs
[1:06:30] the one who said try me test me put me
[1:06:33] to the test and see if i'll fail
[1:06:35] thinking of elijah when he's standing
[1:06:37] there i'm out on the mountain and he's
[1:06:39] calling out he says
[1:06:40] call out to your god dear god baal see
[1:06:43] if he'll respond
[1:06:44] see if he'll answer let the god that is
[1:06:46] truly god let him answer with fire
[1:06:50] and then how much did he believe in this
[1:06:52] god he says okay now when we build this
[1:06:54] altar
[1:06:54] soak it wet fill it full of water make
[1:06:58] it seem impossible
[1:07:00] and watch my god answer
[1:07:03] just try god try god
[1:07:07] test him see lord you said so i'm going
[1:07:09] to take you at your word
[1:07:12] and see if he does it more over
[1:07:15] way above than you could even imagine
[1:07:18] first john chapter four verse four
[1:07:24] just a couple of scriptures here year of
[1:07:26] god
[1:07:27] little children capital g
[1:07:31] there's only one capital g god
[1:07:35] little children and you ha and have
[1:07:36] overcome them because
[1:07:38] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:07:41] that is in
[1:07:42] the world ye have overcome them seducers
[1:07:46] if you go back and read the first
[1:07:48] three verses of there he's talking about
[1:07:50] those that come in to do so those evils
[1:07:52] perverted spirits and all this you have
[1:07:54] overcome those
[1:07:56] seducers because greater is a spirit of
[1:07:58] christ that is in you
[1:08:00] than the spirit of antichrist that is in
[1:08:02] the world
[1:08:04] the spirit of antichrist has come strong
[1:08:06] and attack hard
[1:08:08] making itself just as religious and just
[1:08:10] looking just as good
[1:08:12] but it's trying to tear you down but the
[1:08:14] spirit of god in you will expose that
[1:08:16] spirit every time
[1:08:18] he'll call it and i'll say that's not of
[1:08:19] god that's not what you desire
[1:08:23] creator is he that is in you now let's
[1:08:26] look at a couple of things in the old
[1:08:28] testament from habakkuk
[1:08:30] chapter 2 verses 18 to 20.
[1:08:36] what propheteth the graven image that
[1:08:38] the maker thereof has a grave in it
[1:08:40] the molten image and a teacher of lies
[1:08:42] that the maker of his work trusteth
[1:08:45] therein
[1:08:46] to make dumb idols and and of course you
[1:08:49] could
[1:08:50] say the word dumb as not very
[1:08:53] intelligent no he
[1:08:54] doesn't speak doesn't speeches can't
[1:08:56] respond can't talk with you can't have a
[1:08:58] conversation with you
[1:08:59] cannot take and put something in your
[1:09:01] heart
[1:09:03] it's just he says let's go to the next
[1:09:07] one to him that saith to the wood awake
[1:09:10] to the dumb stone arise it shall teach
[1:09:14] behold it's laid over with gold and
[1:09:16] silver and there is no breath at all
[1:09:18] in the midst of it
[1:09:21] he said you would you would turn and
[1:09:24] give your your
[1:09:25] yourself to something that has no life
[1:09:27] in it
[1:09:31] so verse 20 but the lord
[1:09:34] is in his holy temple
[1:09:37] greater is he that is in you you put
[1:09:41] those two scriptures together
[1:09:43] greater is he the lord and is in his
[1:09:45] holy temple he's in you
[1:09:48] he abides in you
[1:09:51] and that's greater
[1:09:54] let all the earth keep silence before
[1:09:58] and this is just me let this earth
[1:10:02] say whatever lord it's your desire
[1:10:08] reverent reverence respect let god
[1:10:12] answer your questions i don't understand
[1:10:15] this lord
[1:10:16] but i'm giving it to you and you said
[1:10:18] you'd take care of it
[1:10:20] so answer it uh there was an old um
[1:10:25] was it an old tv thing that says daddy's
[1:10:28] daddy or father knows best
[1:10:31] way back it was black and white from
[1:10:32] what i remember so that was quite a ways
[1:10:34] back
[1:10:35] father knows best and at every once in a
[1:10:37] while i just thought just come back
[1:10:39] father knows best father you know best
[1:10:42] therefore i commit it to you
[1:10:45] now watch that was in the old testament
[1:10:47] and paul in acts 17
[1:10:51] verses 22 to 28
[1:10:54] then paul stood in the midst of mars
[1:10:56] hill mars hill was it was
[1:10:58] an actual hill there and i looked a
[1:10:59] little bit of the history of it
[1:11:02] from the the romans it was mars hill
[1:11:07] because of the roman gods and from the
[1:11:09] greeks they had another name
[1:11:11] and because they believed the gods had
[1:11:13] had had something to do on that hill
[1:11:15] he says paul stood in the midst of mars
[1:11:17] hill and said ye men of athens
[1:11:20] i perceive that in all things you are
[1:11:22] too superstitious another word for that
[1:11:23] you're too religious
[1:11:26] and remember religion brother bam taught
[1:11:28] us is just a covering that we put on
[1:11:29] ourselves
[1:11:32] if you're not careful you said i'm
[1:11:34] religious
[1:11:36] but i'd rather be a christian than be
[1:11:38] religious
[1:11:40] i know some very very religious people
[1:11:42] who are not christians at all
[1:11:45] for as i passed by and beheld your
[1:11:47] devotions i found an
[1:11:48] alternate with the ex inscription to the
[1:11:51] unknown god
[1:11:52] whom ye therefore you ignorantly worship
[1:11:56] him declare i unto you
[1:12:01] he says i i've walked by and i say
[1:12:02] you're acknowledging that there's a god
[1:12:04] out there that you
[1:12:05] don't know and you're being careful to
[1:12:08] at least give him some honor
[1:12:10] but he said i know that god and i'm
[1:12:13] gonna
[1:12:14] i'm going to unveil him to you i'm going
[1:12:16] to declare him to you
[1:12:17] i'm going to let you know that he exists
[1:12:19] he says god that made the world and all
[1:12:22] things therein
[1:12:23] seen that he is lord of heaven and earth
[1:12:26] dwelleth not
[1:12:27] in temples made with hands and and we'll
[1:12:30] look at that
[1:12:31] in that that's a building everything but
[1:12:33] how many times have we tried to
[1:12:35] configure
[1:12:36] this temple to please god with our own
[1:12:39] hands with our own thinking
[1:12:41] the best way is just i surrender all
[1:12:44] lord i give you myself
[1:12:47] neither is worshipped with man's hands
[1:12:49] as though he needed anything
[1:12:51] seen he giveth to all life and breath to
[1:12:54] all things
[1:12:55] he hath made of one blood all nations of
[1:12:58] men for to dwell on
[1:12:59] all the face of the earth and hath
[1:13:01] determined the times before appointed
[1:13:04] and the bounds of their hamitations
[1:13:06] everything that is there god already set
[1:13:08] it up god already took care of god has
[1:13:09] already said how it's going to be
[1:13:12] therefore rest that god has you in mind
[1:13:15] rest that god has
[1:13:16] you control god has you all can i say it
[1:13:19] figure it out
[1:13:21] rest in that lord i rest in what you
[1:13:24] have for me
[1:13:26] he says that they should seek the lord
[1:13:29] if haply they might feel after him and
[1:13:32] find him
[1:13:34] though he be not far from every one of
[1:13:37] us
[1:13:38] in those old traditions he was the god
[1:13:40] of the moon he was the god of the stars
[1:13:42] he was the god of the sea if
[1:13:43] a thunderstorm broke and that was thor
[1:13:45] over here and this was something
[1:13:47] but no he said this god that you talk
[1:13:50] and ignorantly worship
[1:13:51] has walked just recently right here on
[1:13:53] this earth
[1:13:56] he walked through these things you just
[1:13:57] didn't recognize him he says
[1:14:00] for in him we live and move and have our
[1:14:03] being
[1:14:05] as certain also as
[1:14:08] certain also of your own poets have said
[1:14:11] for
[1:14:11] we are also his offspring your own very
[1:14:14] people have said
[1:14:16] we come from god and i'm glad
[1:14:20] that today he's given me the grace to
[1:14:21] recognize that i am his
[1:14:23] and he is mine how many would say they
[1:14:26] know them
[1:14:28] how many you know god knows you by name
[1:14:30] and who you are and where you are
[1:14:31] recognize that understand god knows you
[1:14:36] paul is dealing with him he says with
[1:14:39] these people in
[1:14:40] in the in the new testament here he's
[1:14:42] saying looking at him going
[1:14:46] you're looking at this he said but i'm
[1:14:48] telling you this god is alive and well
[1:14:50] and has walked through this this land
[1:14:52] here just recently
[1:14:53] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:55] forever now as we look into isaiah
[1:14:59] and let's look at what god has said
[1:15:01] isaiah 43 1-3 and
[1:15:03] and it gets harder and harder to find a
[1:15:05] scripture you've never read before if
[1:15:07] you've read through the bible enough
[1:15:08] times and heard this message
[1:15:10] and they just come back to you and come
[1:15:11] back to you and come back to you over
[1:15:13] and over
[1:15:13] but now thus saith the lord has created
[1:15:16] thee o jacob
[1:15:17] and he that formed the o israel fear not
[1:15:20] for i have redeemed thee i have called
[1:15:22] thee by name thou
[1:15:24] art mine when thou passes through the
[1:15:26] waters i will be with thee and through
[1:15:28] the rivers
[1:15:29] they shall not overflow thee when thou
[1:15:32] walketh through the fire thou shall not
[1:15:33] be burned
[1:15:34] neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
[1:15:39] what a mighty god we serve
[1:15:43] he this is something that that isaiah
[1:15:46] gets
[1:15:46] inspiration to write to israel and we
[1:15:49] are the
[1:15:50] the seed of abraham the promise of god
[1:15:53] goes to his children
[1:15:55] you say well this has happened look
[1:15:59] if god had not kept you and reason why
[1:16:03] you are today where do you think you
[1:16:04] could be
[1:16:05] you could be today take a few moments as
[1:16:08] the brother
[1:16:10] armando said remember what god has done
[1:16:12] for you
[1:16:13] think back sometimes say had it not been
[1:16:16] for the mercy of god and the grace of
[1:16:17] god there where would i be today
[1:16:20] where would my life maybe you look at a
[1:16:22] neighbor or may you look at a friend
[1:16:24] that
[1:16:25] their life has gone so totally different
[1:16:27] and you said you know at one time i was
[1:16:29] in that same situation
[1:16:30] but god rich in mercy has reached out
[1:16:33] and met with me and he's
[1:16:34] telling israel for i am the lord thy god
[1:16:36] the holy one of israel
[1:16:38] thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom
[1:16:42] ethiopia and siba for thee
[1:16:46] and i went to see what that was what is
[1:16:49] he saying there
[1:16:50] there was a time that a king wanted to
[1:16:53] avenge
[1:16:55] uh because something had happened to his
[1:16:57] father the son of the king who had
[1:16:58] become king
[1:16:59] something had to happen to his father
[1:17:02] because of israel
[1:17:03] so he got these kingdoms with him we're
[1:17:05] going to go
[1:17:06] and destroy israel for this and god
[1:17:09] turned it around
[1:17:10] and those kingdoms destroyed him
[1:17:15] god just turned it all around he said
[1:17:16] you think you're going to
[1:17:18] mess with israel you're messing with me
[1:17:21] you're stepping into my boundary now you
[1:17:23] have to deal with me
[1:17:26] understand that when satan gets in
[1:17:27] around close to you and he starts going
[1:17:29] he's got to deal with god in your life
[1:17:33] you say lord you fight my battles
[1:17:36] i'm not i'm not able to withstand satan
[1:17:39] with my own intelligence my own
[1:17:40] abilities
[1:17:41] all i can do is go at it is written it
[1:17:43] is written
[1:17:44] it is written the word of god says
[1:17:48] and saint says oh but you don't know him
[1:17:50] but i do have met him
[1:17:51] i have talked with him i have fellowship
[1:17:53] with him every day
[1:17:54] he talks with me and he walks with me
[1:17:57] and he tells me i am his own
[1:18:00] and i'll stand on that and i'll rest on
[1:18:02] that
[1:18:04] psalms 103 verses one to five
[1:18:10] bless the lord o my soul
[1:18:14] and all that is within me bless his holy
[1:18:16] name
[1:18:18] bless o lord o my soul and forget not
[1:18:21] all his benefits
[1:18:23] who forgiveth all thine iniquities and
[1:18:26] healeth all thy diseases
[1:18:28] iniquities iniquities the things you
[1:18:32] know better to do
[1:18:33] but you do them anyways and the things
[1:18:35] that you
[1:18:36] should be doing and you didn't do and he
[1:18:39] forgives
[1:18:41] as a parent we are we do forgive
[1:18:46] we have hard time forgetting but we do
[1:18:48] forgive
[1:18:50] but there comes a time and they say okay
[1:18:52] that's the third time you've done that
[1:18:54] today son or daughter now you'll have to
[1:18:56] pay the consequences for it
[1:18:59] we want to teach them we would like for
[1:19:01] them to learn
[1:19:03] we hope that that they would grow up to
[1:19:06] to be good
[1:19:06] good citizens to to grow up to be good
[1:19:09] christians
[1:19:10] and we're going to do our best to help
[1:19:12] them along the way
[1:19:14] but we are not those that can forget
[1:19:19] and that's what causes a lot of problems
[1:19:21] we can't forget
[1:19:24] breathe out brother enoch is a good fine
[1:19:27] young man but
[1:19:28] i remember when
[1:19:31] and i've just pretty well knocked half
[1:19:33] of what i said good of brother enoch
[1:19:35] down got to be careful with our words
[1:19:40] why couldn't i just have left it brother
[1:19:42] enoch is a good fine
[1:19:44] young man let brother enoch prove that
[1:19:48] he's not
[1:19:50] don't don't have to be my words no let
[1:19:53] brother e not
[1:19:54] be a good find him but if we're not
[1:19:56] careful our very own words
[1:19:59] we'll take and knock down our very own
[1:20:01] testimony right after we've said but he
[1:20:03] said
[1:20:04] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:20:08] and remembereth them no more
[1:20:12] who healeth all thy diseases all
[1:20:17] uh you go back and especially today uh
[1:20:19] with with what's going on and
[1:20:22] the conversations that people have the
[1:20:24] things you read
[1:20:25] if you listen to the news or however you
[1:20:27] hear
[1:20:28] this side fighting that side this doctor
[1:20:30] against that doctor this
[1:20:32] group against that group and it just
[1:20:34] it's just satan's kingdom that's what it
[1:20:36] is
[1:20:38] but he said i forgive all your
[1:20:40] iniquities
[1:20:41] i heal all your diseases there's nothing
[1:20:44] new under the sun that i can't deal with
[1:20:47] that's not already taken care of
[1:20:51] i'm trying to tell you this god that you
[1:20:53] have your expectation and your belief
[1:20:55] and your
[1:20:55] your hope in he's more than able
[1:21:00] that's who you're trusting in that's who
[1:21:02] you're confiding in
[1:21:04] you know i you read something and i i
[1:21:07] read something the other day about
[1:21:09] about the viruses and and this side of
[1:21:12] it and then i read something about
[1:21:13] this side of it and i said lord let me
[1:21:17] stay
[1:21:17] centered in your word because this side
[1:21:20] brings fear
[1:21:22] this side brings fear and fear is not of
[1:21:25] god
[1:21:27] but god's word brings something that
[1:21:29] settles in your heart
[1:21:31] says yes lord i believe
[1:21:34] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:21:37] who crowneth thee with lovingkindness
[1:21:40] and tender mercies
[1:21:42] who satisfy thy mouth with good things
[1:21:45] so that thy youth is renewed like an
[1:21:48] eagle that's what's god's word and it's
[1:21:49] eternal
[1:21:51] it never fails
[1:21:54] luke chapter 2
[1:21:58] 25 and 30 brethren preaches expectations
[1:22:02] i think five six times and he uses this
[1:22:05] this scriptures on every one of them
[1:22:08] and behold there was a man in jerusalem
[1:22:10] whose name was simeon
[1:22:12] and the same man who was just was just
[1:22:14] and devout
[1:22:15] waiting for the consolation of israel
[1:22:18] and the holy ghost was upon him
[1:22:21] could you put your name right in there
[1:22:23] and the holy ghost was upon him
[1:22:26] is it just when you come to church is he
[1:22:29] with you all times
[1:22:33] i i believe it anybody else believe it
[1:22:35] with me
[1:22:38] if it's not then you're in trouble if
[1:22:40] he's not with you you're in trouble
[1:22:42] but the holy ghost was upon him and it
[1:22:44] revealed unto him by the holy ghost and
[1:22:46] it was revealed unto him by the holy
[1:22:48] ghost
[1:22:48] that he should not see death before he
[1:22:51] had seen the lord's christ
[1:22:54] god said this that you have anticipated
[1:22:56] this that you have had expectation
[1:22:58] this that you've been waiting for
[1:23:00] because you've read it in the scripture
[1:23:02] that isaiah said and this scripture said
[1:23:05] this and you heard about you know about
[1:23:07] it
[1:23:07] you're waiting on it you're waiting for
[1:23:09] that messiah
[1:23:11] he says go to the temple you're going to
[1:23:13] see him
[1:23:15] let's go to the next
[1:23:23] he says and he came by the spirit into
[1:23:25] the temple
[1:23:26] and when he and when the parents had
[1:23:28] brought in the child jesus
[1:23:31] the lord never said he's going to be a
[1:23:33] little baby
[1:23:35] i don't know what simeon was looking for
[1:23:37] but he went to the temple because god
[1:23:39] told him
[1:23:39] you're going to see the fulfillment of
[1:23:41] this promise
[1:23:43] and when the parents brought the child
[1:23:44] to jesus to do
[1:23:46] for him after the custom of the law
[1:23:50] then he took him up in his hands and
[1:23:52] blessed
[1:23:53] god and said
[1:23:56] lord now let us thy servant depart in
[1:23:59] peace
[1:24:00] according to thy word for mine eyes have
[1:24:03] seen
[1:24:04] thy salvation to simeon
[1:24:07] it was as good as done
[1:24:12] lord you told me that this was
[1:24:15] what the scripture said i'm holding this
[1:24:18] child in my hands
[1:24:20] so now i could go to sleep and
[1:24:23] death go to sleep a child of god doesn't
[1:24:26] die he just goes to sleep
[1:24:29] and then he says i can rest at peace now
[1:24:33] 33 years down to the road there was
[1:24:36] going to be one hanging on the cross
[1:24:37] that was going to say
[1:24:39] it is finished
[1:24:42] that's what simeon was looking at right
[1:24:44] there
[1:24:45] i have this promise i have this which
[1:24:48] god has given me
[1:24:49] and therefore it's as good as done in my
[1:24:51] life i can rest on that
[1:24:53] there's an expectation that's going to
[1:24:55] be fulfilled
[1:24:57] god has shown that to me and he walked
[1:25:00] in that
[1:25:01] he didn't give up on it he said take
[1:25:02] your servant home now lord
[1:25:04] it's all right i think we should all be
[1:25:08] able to say that lord
[1:25:10] you can take your servant home now
[1:25:12] because i know
[1:25:13] that it all will come to pass there is
[1:25:15] no fear in that
[1:25:18] now watch this and i'd just like to
[1:25:23] matthew 14 will read a couple portions
[1:25:25] out of 14
[1:25:27] or read 14-21 and then 24-32 and jesus
[1:25:31] went forth and saw a great multitude
[1:25:33] and was moved with compassion toward
[1:25:35] them and he healed their sick
[1:25:38] he hasn't changed he still does the same
[1:25:41] thing
[1:25:41] he still moves in amongst a congregation
[1:25:43] of people and deals with hearts
[1:25:45] and ministers to people and heals the
[1:25:47] sick how many can testify that god has
[1:25:50] done the great things for you
[1:25:52] he still does it he hasn't changed and
[1:25:55] when it was evening his disciples came
[1:25:57] in and sang them
[1:25:59] the same disciples that had gone to mary
[1:26:03] or were there when jesus was at the at
[1:26:05] the wedding
[1:26:07] and they said there's no wine and mary
[1:26:09] just says go talk to him about it
[1:26:13] same once again he says
[1:26:16] the desert this is a desert place and
[1:26:18] the time has now passed send the
[1:26:20] multitude away
[1:26:21] that they may go into the villages and
[1:26:23] buy themselves some victims
[1:26:25] go get some food but jesus said unto
[1:26:27] them they don't have a reason to leave
[1:26:29] there's no need to depart
[1:26:30] give them ye to eat
[1:26:34] they each one check their pockets they
[1:26:36] look in their little well peter how much
[1:26:38] you got
[1:26:38] i got 50 cents how much you got we got
[1:26:41] enough to feed ourselves barely
[1:26:44] this very god that they had seen do over
[1:26:46] and over and over
[1:26:47] tells them go feed them
[1:26:51] and they said and we have here but five
[1:26:53] loaves and two fishes
[1:26:55] and them being like us probably said and
[1:26:58] peter will eat all those by himself
[1:27:01] hey they were human okay and he said
[1:27:05] bring them to hither to me
[1:27:07] and he commanded the multitude to sit on
[1:27:09] the grass
[1:27:12] i think he had a lot of confidence in
[1:27:13] what he just go ahead sit down
[1:27:16] there was no question he knew what he
[1:27:19] was going to do
[1:27:21] command commanded the multitude to sit
[1:27:23] down on the grass and took the five
[1:27:24] loaves and the two fishes
[1:27:26] and looking up to heaven he blessed and
[1:27:28] break
[1:27:29] and gave the loaves to the disciples and
[1:27:32] the disciples to the multitude
[1:27:33] he said go feed him
[1:27:37] put yourself there for a minute if you
[1:27:39] could
[1:27:40] you're watching god and as brother
[1:27:42] braham said that quote the bread is
[1:27:43] already baked it's already
[1:27:46] it's shaped it it looks like it just
[1:27:48] came out of the oven
[1:27:50] it's done it's ready to eat
[1:27:53] there's has to be something going on
[1:27:55] inside
[1:27:57] even though you've seen him do it a
[1:27:59] hundred times you still say
[1:28:02] it's god it's it's we're human
[1:28:05] maybe that's the best explanation i gave
[1:28:07] it we're human
[1:28:10] he says they did eat and were filled
[1:28:12] they took of the fragments that remained
[1:28:14] twelve baskets full
[1:28:16] and they that had eaten were about five
[1:28:18] thousand men besides women and children
[1:28:23] god looked at the number said oh more
[1:28:25] than enough
[1:28:28] how much do you got oh wow you could
[1:28:29] probably get rid of half of that and i'd
[1:28:31] still have enough
[1:28:35] now they see this miracle they go
[1:28:38] through all of this they see the feeding
[1:28:40] of these
[1:28:41] there had to be such rejoicing and
[1:28:42] worship and and
[1:28:44] did you see that peter wow is it you
[1:28:46] know just are you being just like us
[1:28:50] so now jesus tells him to go across on
[1:28:53] the ship
[1:28:54] and he goes up to the mountain but the
[1:28:57] ship was now in the midst of the sea and
[1:28:58] tossed with ways for the wind was
[1:29:00] contrary and in the fourth watch of the
[1:29:02] night jesus went into them walking on
[1:29:04] the sea
[1:29:05] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:29:07] on the sea they were troubled saying
[1:29:09] it is a spirit and they cried out for
[1:29:11] fear
[1:29:12] it makes you think that jesus changed
[1:29:14] himself almost he looked like
[1:29:16] a ghost or
[1:29:19] or maybe if you read a little farther he
[1:29:21] said oh ye of little faith
[1:29:25] he's still the same god the situation
[1:29:28] doesn't change him
[1:29:31] the weather doesn't affect him the
[1:29:32] storms don't affect him
[1:29:35] it affects us but it doesn't affect him
[1:29:37] he was still god walking over the sea
[1:29:41] but straightway jesus speaking and said
[1:29:43] be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
[1:29:46] so peter here he says he answered him
[1:29:48] and said lord if it be thou.
[1:29:53] why was peter questioning if it was him
[1:29:57] peter had seen enough of god to know
[1:30:00] that he was quite capable of walking on
[1:30:02] the water
[1:30:04] peter go over to there and catch that
[1:30:06] fish and take out the gold
[1:30:08] and go pay the taxes
[1:30:12] peter had gone through a lot of things
[1:30:13] but he says lord if it's really you
[1:30:16] bid me come unto thee on the water so
[1:30:20] the lord says come on peter
[1:30:22] just come on and when peter was come
[1:30:24] down out of the ship he walked on the
[1:30:26] water to go to jesus he
[1:30:28] walked on the water
[1:30:31] i don't think peter wrote this
[1:30:35] peter wasn't glorifying himself somebody
[1:30:37] else saw it and said
[1:30:38] peter walked on the water but when he
[1:30:41] saw that the wind was boisterous
[1:30:43] he was afraid and beginning to sink he
[1:30:46] cried
[1:30:47] saying lord save me he began to look
[1:30:50] around and he said no wait a minute
[1:30:52] i've never done this before people can't
[1:30:55] do this
[1:30:57] i i don't have uh floaties under my feet
[1:31:00] i don't
[1:31:01] you know he began to think about the
[1:31:03] situation rather than what god
[1:31:05] had told him come on peter
[1:31:10] and immediately jesus stretched forth
[1:31:12] his hand and caught him
[1:31:13] and he said to him oh thou of little
[1:31:16] faith
[1:31:17] wherefore did thou doubt
[1:31:22] lord help my own belief
[1:31:25] when i'm faced with that next situation
[1:31:27] and you just brought me through one
[1:31:31] and then i say oh lord where are you
[1:31:34] did you leave me no
[1:31:37] there's a coming of time when you're a
[1:31:39] child of god
[1:31:40] and you stand on your own feet and god
[1:31:42] puts you through a test
[1:31:45] because one of these days you're going
[1:31:46] to realize he's with me he's never left
[1:31:48] me and you're going to go through the
[1:31:49] test
[1:31:51] it's easier when when dead mama holds
[1:31:55] the little children's hands
[1:31:59] we're over with eunice and sean at the
[1:32:01] they have this the swimming pool there
[1:32:03] and
[1:32:03] little liam's about a year and a half
[1:32:04] old now
[1:32:06] and if you turn your head liam just
[1:32:08] jumps right in the pool
[1:32:11] whether it's the what a foot deep there
[1:32:14] foot and a half deep or five feet on the
[1:32:16] other side four and a half whatever it
[1:32:17] is
[1:32:18] he has no fear of the water
[1:32:21] mom and daddy uncle and cousins and the
[1:32:23] sisters are scared to death for liam
[1:32:26] they don't need to be scared because
[1:32:27] we're plenty scared for him
[1:32:30] all of us at the same time liam
[1:32:34] he says there's everybody here to save
[1:32:38] me
[1:32:39] that's all liam's thing i'm jumping the
[1:32:41] pool because daddy will catch me sister
[1:32:43] will catch me
[1:32:43] somebody will catch me lord let me have
[1:32:47] that confidence in you
[1:32:49] let me have that trust in you that no
[1:32:51] matter where i'm at
[1:32:52] where i'm going you're there with me you
[1:32:55] never leave me
[1:32:56] you never fail me i don't want to
[1:32:59] ignorantly just walk into something
[1:33:01] but there are times things happen but i
[1:33:03] don't have to fear
[1:33:05] you're with me now chloe and asher they
[1:33:09] they're older enough now they know that
[1:33:10] they wear the uh
[1:33:11] the uh fl the vest so we're
[1:33:15] quote unquote we're not as careful with
[1:33:17] those two
[1:33:18] because they're wearing floaties and
[1:33:21] they'll
[1:33:22] survive we have a lot of confidence in
[1:33:25] the floaties don't we
[1:33:27] because we'll even turn our back on them
[1:33:29] sometimes
[1:33:31] but liam is not winning floaty liam has
[1:33:34] got his confidence in
[1:33:36] us lord i don't want to wear my own
[1:33:40] floaties i don't want to wear my own
[1:33:42] thoughts i don't want to wear what i
[1:33:43] think will keep me let me have my full
[1:33:45] confidence and expectation in you
[1:33:49] let me dress myself in the word of god
[1:33:52] in your promises what you are
[1:33:55] above my own ideas
[1:33:58] now there will come a time when liam
[1:34:00] will be able to swim
[1:34:03] and mom and dad will have a little more
[1:34:05] confidence
[1:34:06] they won't be as nervous as worried and
[1:34:09] that little boy won't get yelled at so
[1:34:10] much
[1:34:12] because we all did our fair share of
[1:34:13] yelling
[1:34:15] but it's our concern for him but god
[1:34:18] said i'll be with you
[1:34:19] even in you i'll never leave you i'll
[1:34:22] never forsake you
[1:34:23] i'll never let you walk on your own
[1:34:26] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:34:28] shadow of death i will fear no evil for
[1:34:30] thou
[1:34:30] art with me lord why is there only one
[1:34:33] set of footprints he said because i was
[1:34:34] carrying you
[1:34:35] that time he's still the same yesterday
[1:34:38] today and forever
[1:34:40] and when they were come into the ship
[1:34:42] the wind ceased
[1:34:45] oh my lord that we could come to that
[1:34:48] place in our own lives
[1:34:51] that we would come and say oh lord
[1:34:54] let me have that confidence that no
[1:34:57] matter where i go where
[1:34:59] i'm where my path leads me you're with
[1:35:01] me
[1:35:02] and you never fail man
[1:35:08] hebrews let's finish with hebrews we're
[1:35:10] about done now
[1:35:12] hebrews chapter 10 19 to 23 and if the
[1:35:15] musicians
[1:35:16] want to come up now that would be fine
[1:35:19] having therefore brethren boldness to
[1:35:21] enter into the holiest
[1:35:24] by the blood of jesus the holiest of
[1:35:27] holies
[1:35:28] going into the place where the higher
[1:35:30] priest was allowed to go in once a year
[1:35:33] but there was life in that place
[1:35:37] the rod of aaron was left there and then
[1:35:39] when they came back in it was
[1:35:41] budding there was life in there
[1:35:44] and you and i can go in there today
[1:35:48] it doesn't take a minister it doesn't
[1:35:49] take a pastor it doesn't take
[1:35:51] no you have the privilege to go in and
[1:35:53] talk and meet with god yourself
[1:35:56] and he'll have an audience with you
[1:36:02] he says by a new and living way which he
[1:36:04] has consecrated for us
[1:36:06] through the veil that is to say his
[1:36:08] flesh and having a high priest
[1:36:12] over the house of god
[1:36:16] he says let's finish the last scripture
[1:36:20] there
[1:36:21] 20 22 23.
[1:36:24] let us draw near with a true heart of
[1:36:27] full assurance of faith having our
[1:36:30] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious
[1:36:32] and our bodies washed with pure water
[1:36:35] let us hold fast the profession
[1:36:38] of our faith without wavering for he
[1:36:41] is faithful that promised
[1:36:45] i like that last how he finishes for he
[1:36:48] is faithful the promised he's never
[1:36:52] missed an appointment yet he's never
[1:36:54] missed a time
[1:36:55] he's never had to run back to the
[1:36:56] drawing board he's never had to
[1:36:58] re-figure out the plan and redraw and
[1:37:00] put things on hold
[1:37:01] because i'm not sure how to deal with
[1:37:03] the next situation
[1:37:05] he is faithful that promise
[1:37:09] oh my hope is in the lord
[1:37:12] in his word and his unfailing words of
[1:37:15] promise just power

[1:37:31] if we think we have enough you're more
[1:37:32] than that lord
[1:37:35] our hope our confidence our expectation
[1:37:40] and and maybe tying that with a right
[1:37:43] mental attitude which is
[1:37:44] god's word is true god never fails
[1:37:49] it's written through all over the
[1:37:51] scriptures from from the front cover to
[1:37:53] the back lord
[1:37:54] of your faithfulness
[1:37:57] at times lord that maybe if you would
[1:38:00] have been like us you would just got rid
[1:38:02] of everything and started all over

[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:15] i looked up and i didn't see brother
[1:45:16] jordan that's why i asked for the man to
[1:45:18] come up
[1:45:19] so
[1:45:23] so i got this note just a little update
[1:45:26] on
[1:45:27] brother matthew watkins
[1:45:32] he um they were having a family camp up
[1:45:35] in and i don't know if they had it or
[1:45:36] not
[1:45:37] up in sheldon and brother timothy pruitt
[1:45:40] had been asked
[1:45:41] to to host the camp that's
[1:45:44] brother dale smith and the church up in
[1:45:46] flagstaff
[1:45:49] and brother dale had asked brother matt
[1:45:52] if he would
[1:45:53] be standby in case he was needed and
[1:45:58] brother timothy pruitt had called
[1:46:00] brother dale just
[1:46:02] the week before because sister pruitt's
[1:46:05] health was
[1:46:06] was very poor that he felt it would be
[1:46:08] best if he didn't come
[1:46:10] so brother dale called brother matthew
[1:46:14] and asked him
[1:46:15] if he would cover the services of
[1:46:17] brother matthew let us know that this
[1:46:19] weekend
[1:46:20] friday saturday and sunday he would be
[1:46:22] covering the
[1:46:24] family camp for brother dale smith now
[1:46:28] we had spoken with brother matthew
[1:46:30] several times this past
[1:46:31] week in phone conference just kind of
[1:46:35] laying things out let me just say that
[1:46:38] what is in in that possibility
[1:46:42] that he would become our pastor just
[1:46:44] beginning to lay things out
[1:46:46] how he would go forward
[1:46:47] [Music]
[1:46:49] both sides asking questions and talking
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:53] so brother matthew let us know that he
[1:46:56] was doing so he said so it'll be a
[1:46:57] couple more days
[1:46:59] now brother matthew sent us a text
[1:47:02] because and i don't know the details but
[1:47:05] somehow
[1:47:06] what we heard was covet got in among
[1:47:08] some of the brothers that were going to
[1:47:09] be at the camp
[1:47:11] so brother matthew felt it was best that
[1:47:12] he didn't go
[1:47:14] and so he told us at the beginning of
[1:47:16] this week he would
[1:47:18] be we would have another phone
[1:47:19] conference
[1:47:21] and had just been praying and asking us
[1:47:23] to continue to pray
[1:47:25] and so that's where we stand today
[1:47:30] because of that camp and we were aware
[1:47:32] of it
[1:47:33] and again i would just say we should be
[1:47:36] in prayer
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:39] it's it's it's it's how we
[1:47:42] we have god uh speak to us how we speak
[1:47:45] to god
[1:47:47] and how he answers because he said to
[1:47:48] pray to talk to him
[1:47:51] and as i i think it was brother samuel
[1:47:53] browning that said
[1:47:54] prayer is not just on your knees prayer
[1:47:56] should be an attitude all day
[1:48:00] and and i started to say something and i
[1:48:02] i got tracked off this
[1:48:04] earlier i was in the house and the the
[1:48:07] painter he's an older gentleman
[1:48:10] um a hispanic man and i've
[1:48:13] we're all the guys that get in it at the
[1:48:15] end of the house and we're doing the
[1:48:16] detailing out so
[1:48:18] so you see the same people over and over
[1:48:19] and most of us don't know each other's
[1:48:22] names but we
[1:48:23] talk to each other she had his radio on
[1:48:25] and and he's
[1:48:26] playing some some he's a mexican man
[1:48:29] an older man always speaks spanish but
[1:48:31] he always has a radio on in english
[1:48:33] and he's playing the oldies songs and
[1:48:37] there are songs from when i was quite
[1:48:39] younger
[1:48:41] and those are the hardest songs to
[1:48:42] ignore because they bring back memories
[1:48:45] there's other songs that other songs i
[1:48:47] could just turn off and it just
[1:48:48] it was all day we were in there probably
[1:48:50] three hours together trying to get this
[1:48:52] house ready for the homeowner
[1:48:55] so as i drove away the songs were still
[1:48:56] ringing in my head
[1:48:58] and i asked the lord you know what you
[1:49:01] can talk to god
[1:49:03] you can verbally talk to god you don't
[1:49:06] have to think that you can talk to him
[1:49:08] and i ask him because he's answered me
[1:49:11] when i've asked him without fail
[1:49:14] and i said lord how do i get these songs
[1:49:17] out of my mind
[1:49:20] and as i finish that sentence
[1:49:23] he just said he began to sing a song
[1:49:27] back to me
[1:49:30] think about his love think about his
[1:49:33] goodness
[1:49:34] and immediately all those songs went out
[1:49:37] and we just began to sing he's faithful
[1:49:41] he's a god that is
[1:49:43] sometimes all these things going on
[1:49:45] around us get us nervous
[1:49:47] but talk to god about it tell him to put
[1:49:49] a song in your heart
[1:49:51] tell him to give a scripture remind you
[1:49:53] of the things he's done for you
[1:49:56] so i drove down the road singing think
[1:49:59] about his love
[1:50:04] think about his goodness
[1:50:10] think about his grace
[1:50:16] that's brought us through
[1:50:23] foreign
[1:50:26] [Music]

[1:50:57] i don't just say that because i'm a
[1:50:59] minister and i stand because god does
[1:51:02] i know that in my life raise your hand
[1:51:05] if you know god talks to you
[1:51:07] if you're one that wonders turn around
[1:51:09] and look and see those who know
[1:51:11] that god does speak to you in an audible
[1:51:13] voice
[1:51:14] and however he does he's faithful
[1:51:18] he does those things for you oh
