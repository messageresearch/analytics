[0:00] [Music]
[0:04] The
[0:05] ocean is
[0:08] dry. There's no stars. There's no stars
[0:12] in the
[0:16] sky. And the
[0:19] sparrow can't fly.
[0:24] Oh, if that is
[0:30] enough, then
[0:32] [Music]
[0:37] heaven. There's no
[0:39] feeling like this.
[0:45] If that is in
[0:50] love and you paid in full by the blood
[0:54] of the lamb. You happy to be here on
[0:57] Wednesday night, Easter week. Let's sing
[1:00] this song. Let's clap our hands. Let's
[1:03] wake up a little.
[1:06] When justice call for a
[1:10] payment for
[1:14] sin, no unworthy could be
[1:18] found among men.
[1:23] But the precious son of God with the
[1:28] cross and thorny crown paid the debt
[1:34] with the blood of the lamb.
[1:40] came paid for by the blood of the
[1:47] lamb. Were free from sin, free to live.
[1:52] Now I am. And it
[1:56] is. And it reads on the page where my
[2:02] sins were written down. made in full by
[2:08] the blood of the lamb. Oh, how
[2:12] great. Oh, how great was the debt that I
[2:20] owed, bound to pay for the seeds I had
[2:26] sown.
[2:30] But in Jesus my Lord, a great treasure I
[2:36] have found. I'm redeemed by the blood of
[2:42] the
[2:44] man. Paid for by the blood of the
[2:53] lamb. Free from sin. Free to live. Now I
[3:01] am. And it reads on the page where my
[3:06] sins were written down. Paid in full by
[3:12] the blood of the lamb. One more time.
[3:15] Paid in
[3:16] full. Paid in for by the blood of the
[3:22] lamb.
[3:25] Free from sin, free to live. Now I
[3:32] am. And it freed on the page where my
[3:38] sins were written down. Made in full by
[3:44] the blood of the lamb. And it
[3:48] reads, And it reads on the page where my
[3:54] sins were written down, paid in full by
[4:00] the blood of the
[4:04] lamb. Would you all stand with me
[4:06] tonight? Brother Manny, would you come
[4:08] open the service in a word of prayer?
[4:10] Come on up.
[4:15] [Music]
[4:19] You have a need, the Lord sees
[4:21] everything. I didn't get any prayer
[4:23] requests, but like I said, he sees
[4:26] [Music]
[4:29] it. I'm not going to do a
[4:32] prayer. Well, let's bow our heads.

[4:37] of Jesus. Thank you for another day that
[4:39] wasn't promised.

[8:14] [Music]
[8:19] I wanted to sing this tonight in honor
[8:21] of Good Friday and the coming
[8:23] resurrection morning.
[8:26] [Music]
[8:44] They were
[8:45] watching from a
[8:48] distance and they could not take their
[8:52] eyes from you. You were
[8:55] bleeding. They were
[8:57] weeping. Faithful sisters, they had
[9:02] followed you. They did not
[9:05] understand. They could not see. They
[9:09] were mourning their
[9:12] loss. And as the sky turned black and
[9:16] the earth turned red at the foot of the
[9:22] [Music]
[9:25] cross. He was standing near your mother.
[9:31] They were so close. They could hear you
[9:34] sighing all around them. Angry
[9:39] voices pierced the
[9:42] darkness as you were dying. But they
[9:46] would not leave. They lingered there no
[9:51] matter the cost.
[9:55] They were staying and they were
[9:59] praying at the foot of the
[10:03] [Music]
[10:05] cross. Keep me near the
[10:10] cross. Near the cross. May I never stray
[10:15] so
[10:16] far that I cannot see what flow down for
[10:21] me at the foot of the
[10:27] cross. Now I'm standing in your
[10:32] presence and I cannot take my eyes from
[10:37] you. You have risen. I'm forgiven.
[10:42] Precious
[10:43] Savior. Oh, I worship you. I'm not
[10:47] looking back. I've heard your voice. I'm
[10:52] staying here. I've made my choice. Now
[10:56] it's real. Now I
[10:59] kneel at the foot of the
[11:06] cross. Keep me near the cross.
[11:11] near the cross. May I never stray so far
[11:17] that I cannot see what flow down for me
[11:22] at the foot of the
[11:27] cross. Keep me near the cross. Jesus
[11:32] near the cross. May I never stray so far
[11:38] that I cannot see what flowed down for
[11:42] me at the foot of the
[11:48] cross. Oh, what a
[11:51] [Music]
[11:54] savior. Isn't he wonderful?
[12:00] Sing
[12:04] hallelujah. Christ is
[12:11] risen. Bow down
[12:13] before
[12:16] him for he is Lord of all. Sing
[12:26] hallelu. Christ is risen.
[12:33] Oh, what a
[12:34] [Music]
[12:37] savior. Isn't he
[12:42] wonderful? Sing
[12:46] hallelujah. Christ is
[12:52] risen. Bow down
[12:55] before him.
[12:58] For he is Lord of all. Oh, sing
[13:06] hallelujah. Christ is
[13:12] risen. Oh, sing
[13:17] hallelu. Christ is risen.
[13:21] [Music]
[13:26] [Applause]
[13:35] Wonderful. Thank you. Let's sing Old
[13:38] Rugged
[13:40] Cross on a hill far away.
[13:43] [Music]
[13:45] And then once we're done as a sister
[13:47] now, I'll have you come up and get
[13:49] ready. On a
[13:52] hill far
[13:54] away stood an
[13:57] old rugged
[14:00] cross, the
[14:03] emblem of
[14:06] suffering and shame.
[14:09] [Music]
[14:12] And I
[14:13] love that old
[14:16] cross with the
[14:19] dearest and
[14:21] best for a world of lost sinners.
[14:26] [Music]
[14:32] So I'll
[14:34] cherish the old
[14:37] rugged
[14:41] cross till my trophies.
[14:45] [Music]
[14:47] lay
[14:50] down. I will
[14:53] cling to the old
[14:56] rug
[15:00] cross and exchange it someday for a
[15:07] crown.
[15:11] In the
[15:12] old rugged cross stained with
[15:17] blood so
[15:20] divine a
[15:23] [Music]
[15:29] wonder for the
[15:32] dear lamb of God. He left his
[15:37] glory
[15:39] above to bear it to dark calary.
[15:49] Oh, I'll
[15:51] cherish the old
[15:54] rugged
[15:58] cross till my
[16:01] trophies at last I lay
[16:07] down. And I will
[16:10] cling to the old
[16:13] rugged
[16:17] cross and
[16:19] exchange it someday for a cr to the old
[16:24] rugged
[16:26] cross and to the
[16:29] old rugged
[16:31] cross I will
[16:34] ever be true.
[16:37] its shame and reproach
[16:41] gladly there
[16:45] bear. Then he'll
[16:47] call me
[16:50] someday to my
[16:52] home far
[16:54] away where is
[16:57] glory
[16:59] forever I'll share.
[17:04] So I'll
[17:07] cherish the old rug it
[17:13] comes. Oh, till my
[17:16] trophies at last I lay down.
[17:23] And I will
[17:25] cling to the old
[17:28] rocked
[17:32] cross and
[17:34] exchange it someday for a
[17:39] crown. Thank you sister.
[17:46] your only
[17:48] son. No sin to
[17:51] hide. But you have sent him from your
[17:55] side to walk
[17:57] upon this guilty
[18:01] sod and to become the lamb of
[18:05] God. Your gift of love they
[18:10] crucified. They laughed and scorned him
[18:13] as he died.
[18:16] The humble king they named a fraud. They
[18:21] sacrificed the lamb of
[18:24] God. Oh lamb of
[18:27] God. Sweet lamb of
[18:30] God. I love the
[18:33] holy lamb of
[18:35] God. Oh me in his precious blood.
[18:42] My Jesus Christ, the lamb of
[18:47] God. I was so lost. I should have
[18:52] died. But you have brought me to your
[18:56] side to be led by your staff and
[19:02] rod and to be called the lamb of God.
[19:09] Oh lamb of
[19:11] God, sweet lamb of
[19:14] God. I love the
[19:17] holy lamb of
[19:19] God. Oh, wash me in his precious
[19:25] blood. My Jesus Christ, the lamb of
[19:31] God. Oh, me
[19:34] in his precious blood.
[19:38] My Jesus
[19:40] Christ, the lamb of
[19:49] God. Thank you very
[19:52] much. I've been enjoying the specials
[19:54] lately. They've been so good. We've been
[19:57] getting more. So, the rest of you who
[20:00] haven't sung
[20:02] yet, start getting some
[20:04] ideas. Would you all stand with me?
[20:06] We're going to sing on the wings of a
[20:08] snow white dove as brother Daniel
[20:11] comes. On the wings of a
[20:15] snow
[20:16] white
[20:18] dove, God sends his
[20:21] pure
[20:23] sweet love, a sign from
[20:30] above on the wings of a dove. Verse one.
[20:38] Jesus our
[20:42] savior came to earth one day.
[20:49] He was born in a stable
[20:53] home in a manger of
[20:57] [Music]
[21:00] hell.
[21:02] [Music]
[21:04] Rejected but not from above.
[21:11] God gave us his
[21:15] sign on the wings of a
[21:20] dove. On the wings of a
[21:24] snow white dove, God sends his pure
[21:30] sweet love, a sign from
[21:37] above on the wings of a
[21:42] [Music]
[21:44] dove. Beautiful singing tonight. Let's
[21:48] pray.
[21:52] Father, if we only truly
[21:56] knew. Lord, you give us a little
[22:00] taste.
[22:02] Father, we want to know you and the
[22:05] power of your
[22:06] resurrection, in the glory, Lord, of of
[22:09] your
[22:11] being. Thank you, Father, for preserving
[22:13] your word to us that we might get a
[22:17] glimpse of the greatness of God.
[22:21] Thank you for your son Jesus
[22:23] Christ died on the cross for our sins as
[22:27] as these songs that were sung tell us.
[22:31] Father, we thank
[22:33] you Lord. Now as I open up your word, I
[22:37] pray that your anointing would be on it
[22:40] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be
[22:45] seated. Thank you.
[22:49] really nice job, Sister Sarah and Sister
[22:52] Naomi. Perfect, perfect songs just for
[22:56] this week. And uh, Brother
[22:59] Josiah, he um, he sang that. Brother
[23:02] Michael, I want to tell you something,
[23:04] Brother Josiah, when he sang that song
[23:07] um, on the wings of a snow white dove.
[23:09] First time I never grew up in church.
[23:11] First time I ever I'm sorry, not on the
[23:13] wings of a snow white dove, the old
[23:14] rugged cross. First time I ever heard
[23:17] that song. As I said, I never grew up in
[23:19] church, but it was your sister Sherry
[23:23] that sang that song in church. And it
[23:26] was that song that she used to sing. And
[23:28] u also uh when he was on the cross, I
[23:31] was on his mind. So
[23:35] um and when you don't grow up in church,
[23:38] these you just seems like you appreciate
[23:41] the things that you didn't have growing
[23:43] up even more. And the music I uh Brother
[23:46] Manny I appreciate it so much. I know
[23:48] you do too. Really speaks to me these
[23:52] songs. Sister Sarah was singing that
[23:55] Easter
[23:56] song at the foot of the
[23:59] cross. And there weren't very many
[24:01] people that were at the foot of the
[24:03] cross. There was believe it was three
[24:05] women named Mary. Mary the mother of
[24:08] Jesus, another Mary and and Mary Mary
[24:11] Magdalene that were there. And I believe
[24:15] John the Apostle was there. I we have
[24:19] the opportunity now to kneel at that
[24:24] cross all the time. And I look back in
[24:28] that day and I
[24:30] probably would not have been one of
[24:33] those ones, one of those special ones
[24:34] that knelt down at the cross. But I'm
[24:37] I'm thankful for the ones that did. And
[24:39] and I'm also thankful for the ones that
[24:41] that learned and that have brought this
[24:44] gospel to us. Even though they they may
[24:47] not not have been there. They may have
[24:48] been
[24:49] afraid, but now we have their
[24:54] words forever preserved in this this
[24:58] glorious
[25:00] book. Know what it is about Easter, but
[25:03] it just it really gets to me. I think
[25:08] about everything that's happened during
[25:10] this week and I I I try to relive it
[25:14] every day. I'll uh our lesson tonight,
[25:18] we're on our Bible study and I'll uh
[25:21] I'll go through the the days that led up
[25:24] to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
[25:27] And as I'm going through each day, I'll
[25:30] go through the first three days. I'll
[25:32] read scriptures and then I will I'll go
[25:34] through quickly through the rest. But as
[25:36] I'm as I'm speaking, think
[25:39] about
[25:41] the event that was most pivotal in this
[25:46] time in this week and think about what
[25:50] you think. There's not going to be a
[25:51] right answer obviously for this, but
[25:53] think about what event that led up to
[25:56] the crucifixion of Jesus. Think about
[26:00] what was the most pivotal and what had
[26:02] the most gravity. what had the most
[26:04] far-reaching effects? Of course, not the
[26:07] the death and the resurrection, but what
[26:09] led up to that day? And then I'd like to
[26:12] hear, we're in a Bible study, so it's
[26:13] more more informal. So, I'd like to hear
[26:16] what you all think is would be that most
[26:20] pivotal time. Hopefully, we will get to
[26:23] that point. I think we will. Day one was
[26:27] uh it
[26:29] was we call it Holy Week. this day that
[26:33] Jesus came in to the city of Jerusalem
[26:37] riding on this donkey. It's called Palm
[26:40] Sunday. What a what a day that was. And
[26:44] I'm sure the disciples as Jesus was
[26:46] coming in, the disciples were probably
[26:48] saying,
[26:50] "Finally, finally, he is going to be
[26:53] crowned king of Israel. He has been
[26:56] prophesied to come. We know this is the
[26:58] Messiah.
[27:00] finally this is going to be the day. And
[27:04] as he as he came in and everyone was
[27:06] waving the palm leaves and and he was
[27:09] riding in and they were singing hosana
[27:11] to the king. I can only imagine how
[27:14] those disciples just felt vindicated.
[27:17] They just felt good. Let's turn to
[27:19] Matthew chapter
[27:21] 21. We'll start with verse verse one and
[27:24] we'll read about that. It's uh Matthew
[27:27] chapter 21, Mark 11, Luke chapter 19,
[27:30] and John 12 all tell the story of Palm
[27:33] Sunday. Matthew chapter 21 verse
[27:36] one. And when they drew nigh unto
[27:39] Jerusalem, and were come to Beth Paji
[27:42] unto the Mount of Olives, then sent
[27:45] Jesus two disciples, saying unto them,
[27:47] Go into the village over against you,
[27:49] and straightway you shall find an ass
[27:51] tied and a colt with her. loose them and
[27:54] bring them unto me. And if any man say
[27:57] unto you, if any man say ought unto you,
[28:00] you shall say, the Lord hath need of
[28:02] them, and straightway he will send, he
[28:04] will send them. All this was done that
[28:07] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[28:09] by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the
[28:12] daughter of Zion, behold, the king
[28:14] cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon
[28:17] an ass, the cult a and a colt, the full
[28:22] of an ass. It's quoting two different
[28:25] scriptures.
[28:27] Isaiah chapter
[28:29] 62:1, it's saying that this is
[28:32] fulfilling as Jesus rides in to to the
[28:36] uh to the city of Jerusalem. It's
[28:38] fulfilling these two two scriptures.
[28:40] Isaiah 62:11, Zechariah 9:9. I read I'll
[28:43] read Isaiah
[28:44] 62:11. Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed
[28:47] unto the end of the world, say ye to the
[28:49] daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation
[28:51] cometh. Behold, his reward is with him
[28:55] and his work before him. The first
[28:59] part of him writing
[29:02] in behold the daughter the say to the
[29:06] daughter of Zion, behold thy salvation
[29:07] cometh. Now Zechariah chapter 9 verse9
[29:10] says
[29:11] this rejoice
[29:13] greatly oh daughter of Zion.
[29:17] Zechariah
[29:18] 9:9, "Behold, the king cometh unto thee.
[29:22] He is just, and having salvation, lowly,
[29:26] and riding upon an ass, and upon the
[29:28] colt, a cult, the f of an
[29:32] ass." So these two scriptures together
[29:35] are fulfilled as Jesus is is riding into
[29:40] the city. One thing that I always I
[29:44] always kind of wondered but I never dove
[29:46] into it is why does it say a
[29:49] donkey and the cult of a
[29:53] donkey? You notice it says that. Has
[29:56] anybody ever wondered about that or or
[29:58] just you just kind of read over it?
[30:01] Well, remember he was supposed to ride
[30:04] into the
[30:06] city on a donkey that had never been
[30:08] ridden on before.
[30:11] So here we have a donkey and then we
[30:14] have the donkey's
[30:16] baby and it was two donkeys. So the the
[30:20] brothers that went in, they went and
[30:21] they got they brought both of them
[30:24] back and Jesus rides on the younger one,
[30:28] the one that had never been ridden on
[30:30] before as he comes into the city. It's
[30:32] Bible study. We can learn things like
[30:35] that. Verse number six, Matthew. Back to
[30:38] Matthew.
[30:40] And the disciples, Matthew uh 21:6, and
[30:43] the disciples went and did as Jesus
[30:46] commanded them, and brought the ass and
[30:48] the colt, and put them put on them their
[30:50] clothes, and they set him thereon. And a
[30:54] very great multitude spread their
[30:55] garments in the way. Others cut down
[30:57] branches from the trees, and straw them
[31:00] in the way. And the multitude that went
[31:02] before and that followed cried, saying,
[31:05] "Hosana to the son of David.
[31:08] Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[31:11] the Lord. Hosana in the highest. We sing
[31:15] a couple different songs with that
[31:18] title.
[31:19] Hosana.
[31:21] Hosana is I'll read it. Says hosana is a
[31:24] lurggical word used in both Judaism and
[31:27] Christianity. In Judaism, it's an appeal
[31:30] for divine help. While in Christianity,
[31:33] it serves as a cry of praise. The term
[31:37] is derived from the Greek word I I can't
[31:40] pronounce it which is believed to be a
[31:44] transliteration of two Hebrew words. All
[31:46] right, brother Lyall. Two Hebrew words.
[31:51] Yasha meaning to save or to deliver and
[31:56] anna
[31:57] ana meaning to please meaning please. I
[32:03] beseech. So it defines hosana as a
[32:06] powerful and ancient expression of
[32:08] praise and adoration in Christian
[32:11] worship originating from the Hebrew
[32:14] um Hebrew. Its meaning has evolved from
[32:17] a plea evolved from a plea for
[32:20] salvation. Save us we pray to a joyful
[32:23] declaration of salvation and
[32:26] deliverance. And really I believe right
[32:29] there is when we see the fulfillment of
[32:31] that word hosana.
[32:35] And when he was come into Jerusalem, all
[32:37] the city was moved, saying, "Who is
[32:39] this?" And the multitude said, "This is
[32:42] Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of
[32:46] Galilee."
[32:48] And they also said, the priest said,
[32:52] "Hey, they're all saying all of this
[32:55] about you, Jesus. Tell them to be
[32:59] quiet. You know, you're causing a big
[33:01] uproar in the city." and they're calling
[33:04] you these these great things, tell them
[33:07] to be quiet. And Jesus says, "If they be
[33:09] quiet, the stones will cry out."
[33:14] That's what happened on day one, Palm
[33:16] Sunday. On day two and Monday, Jesus
[33:20] enters the
[33:22] temple, drives out the merchants and the
[33:25] money changers, declaring, "My house
[33:28] will be called the house of prayer, and
[33:30] you have made it a den of thieves."
[33:31] Markap 11 verse1
[33:40] 15 Mark 11:15 says this and they ca and
[33:44] they come to Jerusalem and Jesus went
[33:46] into the temple and began to cast them
[33:48] out that sold and bought in the temple
[33:50] and overthrew the tables of the money
[33:52] changers and the seats of them that sold
[33:54] doves and would not suffer that any man
[33:58] should carry any vessel through the
[33:59] temple. And he taught, saying unto them,
[34:02] "Is it is it not written, my house shall
[34:05] be called a called of all nations, the
[34:08] house of prayer, but you have made it a
[34:10] den of thieves?" Jesus goes in and can
[34:14] you can you imagine if you are a priest
[34:17] and Jesus walks
[34:19] in violently flipping over the tables
[34:23] binding up cords and start whipping them
[34:25] away you know tearing up all the cages
[34:29] with all the animals. These are animals
[34:31] for holy sacrifice. They're doves.
[34:34] They're
[34:35] lambs. their the animals that they that
[34:38] they are supposed to sacrifice for their
[34:40] own sins. And Jesus comes in and he sees
[34:43] all the money on the on the tables and
[34:45] he sees wow this is church has become
[34:48] now a business
[34:50] and it's all about
[34:52] money tearing everything up and and
[34:55] flipping it over. Imagine what the
[34:57] priests thought. Imagine what the
[34:59] disciples thought like
[35:02] whoa. They stood back. There's a if
[35:05] you've ever read the book Prince of the
[35:07] House of David, it's a beautiful
[35:10] um kind of drama of of what happens when
[35:16] Jesus comes in and and the girl Adena,
[35:19] she's over a long way away and she hears
[35:21] all this ruckus and people screaming and
[35:23] all this things these things being
[35:24] thrown around and they go and it's the
[35:27] young prophet Jesus of Nazareth tearing
[35:30] everything up. He had just come. As he
[35:34] was on his
[35:36] way, he was hungry.
[35:38] Hungry. Walks by a fig tree. It's a
[35:42] springtime. Figs don't bear fruit in the
[35:45] spring. Jesus comes up to the the fig
[35:48] tree and he looks and there's no figs on
[35:50] it to eat and he curses
[35:53] it. The next day, fig tree's withered,
[35:59] dying. After he curses it, he goes in,
[36:02] turns the money the money changers
[36:04] tables over and and that. On day
[36:07] three, Jesus teaches in the temple. This
[36:10] is Tuesday, yesterday. Jesus teaches in
[36:14] the
[36:14] temple. He spends the whole day and he's
[36:17] teaching in parables and he's answering
[36:19] questions and he's warning about the
[36:21] hypocrisies of the religious leaders.
[36:24] And he's tell and he's he also he speaks
[36:26] about the end time and he speaks about
[36:28] his second coming. He tells the parable
[36:31] some of the parables that we've gone
[36:32] through over the past few months. He ter
[36:34] tell tells the parable of the wheat and
[36:35] the tears how they should let them grow
[36:38] together. Famous story happens on this
[36:40] day when the Pharisees they try to trap
[36:42] him in paying
[36:44] taxes. He tells them he says pull out
[36:47] pull out a
[36:50] coin. We have a
[36:52] soul in our in in ourselves. He says
[36:55] yeah pay your taxes. Abide by the laws,
[36:59] but more importantly, give your soul to
[37:03] God. Money is earthly, so pay your
[37:06] taxes, but your soul belongs to
[37:09] God. The widow comes to the
[37:11] temple and she Jesus is watching her and
[37:15] others are watching her. They see people
[37:17] coming in and there's the box there and
[37:19] they're they're putting their their
[37:21] offerings in the box and the rich people
[37:23] are coming in and they're flipping out
[37:25] the $100 bills and they're dropping them
[37:27] in. And here comes the little widow lady
[37:30] and she digs in her what we would call
[37:32] her purse and she pulls out two coins
[37:34] and she puts them in the
[37:37] box. And
[37:39] Jesus
[37:40] says points it out and says, "Who gave
[37:44] more?
[37:45] Did the widow or did all of these people
[37:48] that were putting in those hundreds and
[37:50] putting in all those money, all that
[37:52] money? He said the widow gave more
[37:55] because she gave a higher percentage of
[37:57] what she owned. She gave a a bigger
[38:00] portion of what she had. He said she's
[38:03] the one that gave more. All of these
[38:05] rich people, it's nothing for them to
[38:06] throw hundreds in there. But for this
[38:09] little widow to give what she had, she
[38:13] is the one that is more blessed. Even
[38:15] though the the trustees might say, "Oh,
[38:18] we didn't get much in the offering
[38:20] today." Those two coins that that widow
[38:23] gave were far more as I said than those
[38:27] hundreds. He prophesies about nation
[38:31] rising in against nation. And and he he
[38:33] he warns as he has warned so many times
[38:37] about false prophets arising and
[38:39] deceiving
[38:40] many. And there should be signs in the
[38:42] sun and in the moon and in the stars and
[38:44] on the earth and distress of nations
[38:46] with perplexity in the sea and the waves
[38:49] roaring and men's men's hearts failing
[38:51] them from fear and expectation of those
[38:54] things which are coming to the earth.
[38:56] For the power of the heavens will be
[38:59] shaken. Then they will see the son of
[39:01] man coming in a cloud with glory and
[39:04] with power and great glory. Now when
[39:07] these things begin to happen, look
[39:10] up. Lift up your
[39:12] heads because your redemption is drawing
[39:15] nigh. Your redemption is
[39:17] near. Said that on this this day, this
[39:21] Tuesday, he tells the people the parable
[39:23] of the fig tree. When you see the
[39:24] flowers starting to form on the on the
[39:28] branches, then you know that summer is
[39:29] coming. He tells the parable of the 10
[39:31] virgins where five were ready for the
[39:33] coming of the Lord and the other five
[39:35] were lazy and didn't prepare. They
[39:38] weren't ready for the bridegroom to
[39:40] come. He tells the parable of the
[39:42] talents of the bags of gold where he had
[39:45] three servants. Five, he gave five bags
[39:47] of gold to one. He gave two to another
[39:49] and he gave one bag to the last one. The
[39:52] man with five bags of gold or silver,
[39:55] what whatever the valuable was it, he
[39:58] doubled his. The one that was given two,
[40:01] he doubled his. But the one that was
[40:02] only given one, the man was afraid and
[40:05] he dug a hole and he buried it. He's
[40:10] lazy. When the master comes back, he was
[40:13] pleased with the with the one that had
[40:15] that was given five bags because he had
[40:18] doubled it. He was pleased with the one
[40:20] that was given two bags because he had
[40:22] doubled it. But the one that only had
[40:26] one bag that buried it and didn't
[40:30] get didn't receive even
[40:33] interest. He was
[40:36] upset and he says you could have le at
[40:38] least earned something with my money.
[40:41] And the man was cast into outer
[40:42] darkness. A
[40:44] parable. He makes many famous statements
[40:47] that day. Hey, he even says, "Heaven and
[40:49] earth will pass
[40:50] away. My word will never pass away." One
[40:54] of the things he said on that
[40:57] Tuesday, all the sermons that are
[41:00] preached all these 2,000 years from all
[41:02] of these parables and all those things
[41:03] that I had just just talked about, he
[41:06] said it all. The Lord said all of these
[41:08] things in one
[41:09] day. This is when the Pharisees began
[41:12] their plan of attack against
[41:15] Jesus.
[41:17] yesterday, Monday, he turned everything
[41:19] upside down, throwing the money
[41:20] everywhere and disrespecting their way
[41:22] of selling, disrespecting their way of
[41:24] worship. So they they was that was the
[41:26] last straw. He comes in, this triumphant
[41:29] king, who does he think he is? And then
[41:31] he comes in and he turns over all of our
[41:32] stuff and messes everything up. Who does
[41:34] this guy think he is? We have got to put
[41:37] this guy away.
[41:39] And they started on their
[41:43] plans. And on
[41:46] Wednesday, the priests were devising
[41:50] against him. There's not much written
[41:52] about Wednesday. This is the day that
[41:55] the woman comes
[41:58] in. This woman from
[42:01] Bethany and she has compassion on the
[42:06] Lord. She comes down in and she falls
[42:08] down on his feet at at his feet. She
[42:11] begins weeping. She anoints him with
[42:14] this sweet smelling
[42:17] oil. And as her tears wash his feet, she
[42:20] washes them with her
[42:23] hair. That's that's
[42:26] Wednesday.
[42:28] Thursday, Peter and John were sent to
[42:31] prepare the Passover meal. After sunset,
[42:35] he eats the meal with his 12 disciples,
[42:38] washes the disciples feet. Judas
[42:42] departs, goes to betray betray,
[42:45] meets
[42:46] with the
[42:49] priests. The Lord's supper is
[42:53] instituted. What we did a couple weeks
[42:55] ago, he said, "Do this in remembrance of
[42:58] me." Judas betrays him, goes to the
[43:02] Sanhedrin, the to the he goes to the the
[43:05] house of the high priest. And then on
[43:09] Friday, then on Thursday night, Jesus
[43:13] walks his disciples down the the
[43:16] mountain and he gets to the Garden of
[43:19] Gethsemane on Thursday night. He goes
[43:21] into the garden and he prays,
[43:25] tears coming out and and and the water
[43:28] coming coming out and mixing with blood
[43:31] or or the blood and the water, it's
[43:33] separated. and he's praying and he's
[43:35] he's saying,"Lord, if there would be
[43:38] some way, let this cup pass from me." He
[43:43] knew what was coming. He didn't want to
[43:44] do it. There in that dark night in that
[43:49] garden, he wanted somebody to help him
[43:51] out. He wanted somebody to pray with
[43:53] him. And he sets the disciples here. He
[43:55] says, "Just pray." And the disciples are
[43:57] there and they're tired. It's been a
[44:00] long week, man. all the stuff going on
[44:03] with the with Palm Sunday and then
[44:05] everything that with him turning over
[44:07] the the the tables and and all of this
[44:10] going on. It's like, boy, I I I just
[44:12] need some rest. And they are there
[44:14] sleeping. And here is Jesus and he says,
[44:16] couldn't you just stay awake for a
[44:18] little while?
[44:22] Then he wakes him
[44:25] up. He says, "They're coming Thursday
[44:29] night.
[44:32] They show up. Judas leading them. He
[44:33] walks up to
[44:35] Jesus and tells
[44:38] the tells the soldiers. He says, "The
[44:40] one that I kiss is the one that you
[44:43] should take." He walks up to Jesus and
[44:46] kisses him on the cheek and he says,
[44:48] "Friend, you betray me with a
[44:51] kiss." They come in. There's a a bit of
[44:54] a
[44:55] skirmish. The disciples get afraid. The
[44:58] disciples all run away. They take
[45:03] Jesus that
[45:06] night. They bring him to the house of
[45:09] this of the high priest. And there the
[45:13] first court trial
[45:16] happens. Peter betrays Jesus that
[45:18] Thursday
[45:19] night. And on Friday, early in the
[45:23] morning, the first trial happens before
[45:24] Annis, the high priest. And it's still
[45:26] it's still it's just past midnight. He's
[45:29] looking, Annis is looking for an
[45:31] accusation and he's biting time to all
[45:34] the Sanhadrin gets together and they're
[45:36] they're trying to get people to witness
[45:38] against this man, Jesus Christ, these
[45:40] false witnesses. Then there's a second
[45:43] trial before the Sanhedrin and Jesus is
[45:47] condemned. He's
[45:50] slapped, beaten. Third
[45:53] trial. Immediately at
[45:56] dawn, Peter denies Jesus the third
[46:01] time as the rooster
[46:05] crows. Condemnation is just repeated of
[46:09] of Jesus. And then he's taken to the
[46:11] Romans. And the fourth trial begins
[46:12] before
[46:15] Pilate. And then the fifth trial, Pilate
[46:17] takes him to Herod. Another another
[46:19] trial takes place. Herod says, "Oh,
[46:21] don't you have any miracles? I want to
[46:22] see a
[46:23] miracle. Jesus just stays
[46:28] quiet. In the sixth trial again before
[46:32] Pilate and this is the
[46:34] end, last one. Jesus is scorged. He's
[46:39] beaten the city. Pilate brings him out
[46:44] in front of all of the
[46:47] mob. And Pilate even says, "What has he
[46:50] done?
[46:53] And he says the he says I will it's your
[46:55] custom I'll release to you a
[46:58] prisoner. He puts up the very worst that
[47:00] he could put knowing that they would
[47:02] choose this Jesus because he had never
[47:04] done anything wrong. They just hated him
[47:06] and Pilate could see that. So he puts
[47:08] the two
[47:10] there and they cry out, "Give us
[47:12] Barabbus the
[47:14] murderer. Let him
[47:17] go and crucify Jesus.
[47:22] Pilate goes back and he's he knows
[47:24] they're innocent. The night before,
[47:26] Pilate's wife, his own wife, said, "Have
[47:29] nothing to do with this
[47:31] man because I was warned in a
[47:36] dream." Pilate goes back and he says,
[47:39] "I'm clean of this. This is your
[47:41] choice." They said, "Let his blood be
[47:43] upon us and upon our children." Pilate
[47:45] goes back and he washes his hands and he
[47:47] says, "I'm clean of this.
[47:54] still early on Friday
[47:57] morning. They take him to the
[48:01] cross about 9:00 in the
[48:04] morning. They crucify him. Jesus carries
[48:07] his cross through the city of Jerusalem.
[48:10] Simon the Sirene is told to help
[48:13] him. They carry the cross up.
[48:17] They put him up on Golgtha at about 9:00
[48:20] in the
[48:21] morning. Time goes
[48:24] down. Jesus dies about 3:00 in the
[48:28] afternoon. That
[48:30] night, Joseph of Arythea,
[48:35] Nicodemus, they ask for Jesus's
[48:38] body. Pilate gives him the body. They
[48:42] take it, put him, put Jesus in a grave
[48:45] that had never been used before. It was
[48:47] Joseph's rich the rich man in his own
[48:49] grave. Jesus is put in the grave on
[48:53] Saturday on uh on Friday
[48:56] evening and then he lays there all day
[49:03] Saturday. Pilate on on Saturday, Pilate
[49:05] puts a guard in front of the
[49:09] tomb. And you can only imagine what the
[49:12] disciples were going through at that
[49:14] time.
[49:15] everything that they had thought that
[49:17] this man was. They started
[49:21] questioning. He couldn't have died such
[49:24] a shameful death if he was the
[49:26] Messiah. He had the power to heal all of
[49:29] these people. Yet, he didn't have the
[49:30] power to save
[49:32] himself. Maybe we were wrong. He was a
[49:34] prophet, but maybe we were wrong about
[49:37] this
[49:38] man. Saturday, you can imagine that was
[49:40] probably the longest day in history.
[49:44] Sunday
[49:45] morning, Mary Magdalene, God bless her
[49:48] loyal heart.
[49:50] Brother Law was telling me earlier
[49:54] um last week about how Mary was up
[49:57] before
[49:59] daylight and walking through the city by
[50:03] the light of the
[50:04] moon going to the grave and
[50:07] just as the sun was coming
[50:11] up Mary was a witness Jesus had risen
[50:15] from the grave.
[50:17] So those are the events of this
[50:21] week.
[50:22] What do you think? What's the most
[50:26] pivotal thing to you? There's no right
[50:30] answer to you. What means the
[50:34] most that happened this week? What do
[50:36] you think had the most um had the had
[50:40] had the most effect in all of these
[50:43] things that had happened from Sunday all
[50:46] the way to Sunday? Of course, not the
[50:47] death and
[50:49] resurrection. Anybody? Josiah, what do
[50:52] you think?
[51:18] I don't know. I thought about that too.
[51:21] I assume that he was talking about what
[51:23] was about to happen. And the the Jews
[51:26] were about to go through a very very
[51:28] hard
[51:29] time. And I mean, they had just said,
[51:32] "Let his blood be upon us and upon our
[51:35] children." And Jesus tells him, "Don't
[51:38] wait for
[51:39] me. Wait for your
[51:43] children." What else? What is a What was
[51:46] another one, Brother Joe? What do you
[51:48] think? What really struck you about the
[51:50] past week?
[52:14] Yeah. Like like Peter
[52:15] just
[52:17] running and and and losing his testimony
[52:20] so quickly and Jesus even he was only on
[52:22] the cross for very long. It even
[52:24] surprised I mean physically we're
[52:26] fragile. We um by the grace of God uh
[52:31] Klehano is doing well.
[52:33] Um, I just sent out a report. He had his
[52:36] but he had his uh his leg
[52:39] amputated and it was just it was it was
[52:43] from an ATV accident year a few years
[52:45] ago and he didn't know when he woke up
[52:48] that morning how fragile he really was.
[52:51] And all of us we we have to be so
[52:53] careful because we are we don't know we
[52:57] don't know what tomorrow holds.
[53:00] Someone else.
[53:18] So, brother Aaron said
[53:21] that that's a good one. That's a very
[53:23] good one. But Aaron said when he was
[53:25] praying at the Garden of
[53:27] Gethsemane and he was a man and he was
[53:30] crying out and he sword said,
[53:33] "Lord, if this cup could pass from
[53:37] me, Lord, let it be done." But then he
[53:40] said, "But nevertheless, thy will be
[53:43] done." And imagine if he wouldn't have
[53:44] said that. There would be no hope of
[53:46] salvation for us. But he put us above
[53:50] even himself. Sister Sharon.
[54:03] Yeah, it was in the temple. Sure. It was
[54:06] it was torn from top to bottom. That
[54:07] veil was huge. It was
[54:10] thick and it was torn from top to bottom
[54:14] because that's what
[54:16] hid the secret mercy
[54:19] seat that only the priest could go and
[54:23] see once of ye once a year. And God took
[54:26] the the veil and he ripped it from top
[54:29] to bottom. And it and it was a symbol
[54:31] saying now anyone can come to me by the
[54:35] blood of my son Jesus Christ. That veil
[54:38] was torn
[54:39] into Sister Sharon. I could I could
[54:42] start a sermon on that right
[54:45] now. Someone else. Brother Ed.
[55:20] Brother Ed said
[55:21] that the most impactful for him was when
[55:24] Jesus was dying on the
[55:28] cross and he said it is finished. And he
[55:32] wasn't just talking about his
[55:35] life. He was talking about this whole
[55:38] plan of
[55:40] salvation. How
[55:42] beautiful. There he is and he is about
[55:45] to die. He said, "I can lay down my life
[55:48] and I can take it back up again." And he
[55:50] is up there and he says,
[55:53] "Okay, now it is finished." And then he
[55:57] gave up the ghost. Brother Ed, that is
[55:59] beautiful. Never thought about it like
[56:00] that. It wasn't just finished his
[56:04] life. All of our sins were finished
[56:06] right there. Praise God. I'm loving
[56:09] this. Somebody
[56:11] else, Brother Jordan.
[56:14] when he did not answer.
[56:24] Brother Jordan said that when he didn't
[56:27] answer when these false accusers came
[56:30] came and accused him and he did not
[56:32] answer a
[56:34] word, he didn't even give witness of
[56:37] himself.
[56:39] Even when they
[56:41] said, "Are you the king of
[56:43] Israel?" He says, "You say I am." And he
[56:47] was.
[56:49] He was the Messiah. But he says, "You
[56:52] say
[56:53] it." Didn't even give witness of
[56:55] himself. That humble man. Pilate wanted
[56:59] him
[57:01] to. Pilate wanted to release
[57:04] him. Herod wanted to see a miracle. He
[57:08] had the power to to let him go. And he's
[57:11] he said, 'Oh, do a trick for me. Show me
[57:14] all these miracles I couldn't I just
[57:16] been wanting to see. I couldn't wait. I
[57:17] want to see some of these miracles. Show
[57:19] me one. I'll let you go. Didn't give him
[57:22] the time of
[57:24] day. Someone
[57:26] else. Sister Martha.
[57:46] Sister
[57:48] Sister Martha said, "When the earthquake
[57:51] came, not only did the veil get torn,
[57:54] like Sister Sharon said, but the dead
[57:59] raised and came out of the graves." I
[58:02] was thinking about that
[58:04] yesterday. And the people recognized
[58:06] them.
[58:08] They were walking
[58:11] around. I wish I I wish I knew. What
[58:14] does that mean? That the people
[58:16] recognize him. It's like, "Oh,
[58:18] Moses, was it really like
[58:21] that?" But they came out and they
[58:23] walked. That power of Jesus Christ, the
[58:26] power of the blood of Christ, those men
[58:29] that had been dead for some of them
[58:30] probably a thousand
[58:32] years or
[58:35] more came out of the grave on that
[58:39] day. Tremendous. Someone else,
[58:44] Sister
[58:48] Sarah
[58:57] Jesus says he set his face to Jerusalem.
[59:00] So he knew he was going. But we see the
[59:04] battle of his mind
[59:06] in
[59:13] heity where that moment of surrender was
[59:16] there. And then when they came, he was
[59:19] like, "Okay, now I'm going." And from
[59:21] then on, it was he didn't open his
[59:24] mouth. He didn't argue. It was that
[59:26] moment in the garden of surrender. And
[59:30] that's the part that speaks to me today
[59:33] because we have to do the same thing.
[59:37] And he was our
[59:38] ultimate role model. He's the one that
[59:41] we pattern
[59:43] after. And he showed us there sometimes
[59:46] the
[59:47] are not the thing that you're doing the
[59:49] sacrifice but it's actually the will
[59:51] that's laid down for me is so important
[59:55] so that
[59:59] sister Sarah said
[1:00:01] that when he laid down his
[1:00:04] life we talked about on the cross she
[1:00:07] said he really laid down his life the
[1:00:09] first time at
[1:00:11] Gethsemane
[1:00:13] where he said not not my will, but thy
[1:00:18] will. And that was Jesus's
[1:00:21] surrender. And then everything else
[1:00:24] followed after
[1:00:25] that. That was the battle that was in
[1:00:28] the mind of the man, Jesus Christ.
[1:00:30] Remember, he was God made flesh. Don't
[1:00:33] forget the flesh
[1:00:36] part. The flesh part is the part that
[1:00:40] has thoughts that come into your mind.
[1:00:42] the doubts come
[1:00:44] in, the desires come
[1:00:47] in. He knew how it was. He was a high
[1:00:51] priest that can be touched by the
[1:00:53] feeling of our infirmities. So, he had a
[1:00:56] battle that night, a a battle that maybe
[1:00:58] had never been fought before. It was so
[1:01:00] powerful. And he overcame that night.
[1:01:04] And that's when we finally make that
[1:01:06] decision. Lord, I want to serve you. I
[1:01:08] I'm all in.
[1:01:12] That's when things change and then later
[1:01:16] on we see the power of God
[1:01:19] manifested.
[1:01:21] Amen. Someone
[1:01:24] else sister Millia
[1:01:37] but I was also thinking about
[1:01:40] Judas
[1:01:48] mother to Jesus.
[1:01:52] Only a mother. Sister Ameilia is a
[1:01:55] mother. A mother thinks on those
[1:01:59] things. This man did this to my
[1:02:02] son. This man betrayed my son.
[1:02:06] this man went and lied about my
[1:02:11] son. And he
[1:02:13] did. Judas left that night and went and
[1:02:18] sold Jesus Christ, the Messiah, to his
[1:02:22] death. And
[1:02:24] Mary praying for her son, loving her
[1:02:28] son, walking down the street, watching
[1:02:32] her son who was beaten and bloodied and
[1:02:35] and dripping with blood carry trying to
[1:02:38] carry this cross. He couldn't even hold
[1:02:40] it up himself. How does mom
[1:02:43] feel? That was her little boy. She
[1:02:46] nursed him as a baby. She raised him.
[1:02:49] How do you think mom would feel?
[1:02:53] One more.
[1:02:57] Yeah. Is he?
[1:03:07] Yeah.
[1:03:23] showing
[1:03:25] them house.
[1:03:43] Yeah.
[1:03:44] I mean, as he was saying that the the
[1:03:47] situation that really struck her was
[1:03:49] when Jesus was turning over the money
[1:03:51] change money changers table and he came
[1:03:52] in and and he greeted him with
[1:03:56] anger, but it showed her how we should
[1:04:00] respect the house of the
[1:04:01] Lord and and reverence what we're
[1:04:05] doing. And I would like to add to what
[1:04:08] you say that Jesus is our savior.
[1:04:13] Jesus is our friend. Jesus is the one
[1:04:17] that has taken our sins upon him. But if
[1:04:20] we don't give our lives to him, one day
[1:04:22] he will be our judge.
[1:04:26] Remember the parable about the the
[1:04:28] talents and being cast into outer
[1:04:30] darkness. Jesus will
[1:04:32] judge and there will be justice for
[1:04:36] those that do not accept that blood. Is
[1:04:38] he? It's the most important thing.
[1:04:44] my you want to hear mine even if you
[1:04:47] don't I'm gonna say it. Um the uh to me
[1:04:52] I think the most pivotal
[1:04:55] day was Wednesday
[1:04:57] today. Not much is said about that. But
[1:05:01] let me read what happened.
[1:05:06] Matthew chapter 26 verse
[1:05:11] 6. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, the
[1:05:14] house of Simon the leper, there came
[1:05:16] unto him a woman having an alabaster box
[1:05:19] of very precious ointment, and poured it
[1:05:22] on his head as he sat at me, as he sat
[1:05:25] at at
[1:05:26] dinner. Um, I'll be I'll be right back.
[1:05:30] I need to take a break for a second. I'm
[1:05:31] just kidding. I'll be right back.
[1:05:44] this uh brother Paul Murray, brother
[1:05:47] Paul's here. He gave me
[1:05:49] this. It's uh it's anointing oil, but
[1:05:54] I'd like everybody to just take a smell
[1:05:56] of it and pass it around.
[1:06:01] But it's a it's it's a very
[1:06:03] strong
[1:06:06] smell. And uh let me let me explain
[1:06:09] here. I have a few minutes. Let me
[1:06:11] explain. A lot of people think that this
[1:06:14] is Mary
[1:06:15] Magdalene that an anointed Jesus. And
[1:06:18] and
[1:06:19] and there's actually it's it's not a
[1:06:22] definitive answer. There's scholars that
[1:06:24] say it was Mary Magdalene. Other
[1:06:26] scholars say it wasn't. But brother
[1:06:28] Jordan, if or uh whoever's in charge of
[1:06:31] the video, could you put up the big map
[1:06:34] of
[1:06:38] Israel
[1:06:43] and see
[1:06:48] um
[1:06:57] where is the laser?
[1:07:02] So it says, and I'll read it. It says
[1:07:06] that that this woman that came in, she
[1:07:09] was from Bethany. And you see
[1:07:12] Bethany, Jerusalem is right here. You
[1:07:15] can see Beth Bethany is right here by
[1:07:18] Bethlehem. It's it's very close to
[1:07:20] Jerusalem.
[1:07:22] Mary
[1:07:25] Magdalene, she shows up in
[1:07:27] Galilee. Galilee is way up here. And you
[1:07:32] see this Sea of Galilee here by the uh
[1:07:35] the city of
[1:07:37] Capernium where Jesus's ministry
[1:07:39] started. Way up way up there where Peter
[1:07:42] was from, there is a
[1:07:45] town called Magdala.
[1:07:48] So when you say Mary Magdalene, you're
[1:07:52] they are saying that this is
[1:07:54] Mary from Magdala, right? And she was
[1:07:59] probably from this area right here
[1:08:01] because that's where you see Mary
[1:08:03] Magdalene show up. Mary of
[1:08:06] Bethany is down here by Jerusalem.
[1:08:11] So when it when we we talk about this
[1:08:15] Mary of Bethany, she was the sister of
[1:08:19] Martha and the sister of Jesus's good
[1:08:22] buddy
[1:08:23] Lazarus. So I I believe that this Mary
[1:08:29] that is going to anoint Jesus here is
[1:08:31] not Mary Magdalene but is actually Mary
[1:08:35] the sister of Martha.
[1:08:38] Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the
[1:08:40] house of Simon the leper, there came
[1:08:42] unto him a woman having an alabaster box
[1:08:44] of very precious
[1:08:46] ointment and poured it on his head as he
[1:08:49] sat at meat. So you can smell that that
[1:08:52] anointing oil that's going around. It
[1:08:54] was a really strong
[1:08:56] smell. But when his disciples saw it,
[1:08:59] they had indignation saying, "To what
[1:09:01] purpose is this waste?" when his
[1:09:04] disciples, it was Judas that said
[1:09:07] that to what purpose is this waste? For
[1:09:10] this ointment might have been sold for
[1:09:12] much and given to the poor. John chapter
[1:09:16] 12, you can stay here. John chapter 12
[1:09:18] says this. Then saith one of his telling
[1:09:20] the same story. Then saith one of his
[1:09:22] disciples, Judas is carrot is carrot.
[1:09:25] Simon's son which should betray him. Why
[1:09:28] was not this ointment sold for 300 p and
[1:09:31] given to the poor? This he said not that
[1:09:34] he cared for the poor. This is John
[1:09:35] writing. John knew him.
[1:09:38] This he this he said not that he cared
[1:09:40] for the poor but because he was a thief
[1:09:42] and had to bag and bear what was put
[1:09:45] there
[1:09:46] in back to Matthew. And when Jesus
[1:09:49] understood it, he said unto them, why
[1:09:52] trouble ye the woman? For she hath
[1:09:55] wrought a good work upon me.
[1:10:01] To me, that's a key. She's done
[1:10:03] something good for
[1:10:06] me. For ye have for ye have the poor
[1:10:09] always with you, but me you have not
[1:10:12] always. As they were going down in the
[1:10:15] book of John, as they were walking down
[1:10:17] from
[1:10:17] Jerusalem to um to the garden of
[1:10:22] Gethsemane, Jesus is telling them, he's
[1:10:24] saying, "I am going to leave."
[1:10:28] He's saying, "I am leaving, but it's
[1:10:29] good that I leave because I'm going to
[1:10:31] re because the the comforter will come
[1:10:34] after me." But he was warning them that
[1:10:36] I am leaving. And here he says it right
[1:10:39] here. He says that that she's done
[1:10:42] something good for
[1:10:44] me because the poor you'll always have
[1:10:47] with you. It's good to do good for the
[1:10:48] poor. It's good to buy them clothes.
[1:10:50] It's good to give them a handout or
[1:10:51] whatever. But they're going to get
[1:10:52] hungry again.
[1:10:55] It really doesn't do a whole lot to help
[1:10:58] the poor. It's good and we should do
[1:11:02] it, but Jesus is like, "You're always
[1:11:04] going to have the poor, but me, I'm
[1:11:09] leaving. For ye have for for have for ye
[1:11:12] have the poor always with you, but me,
[1:11:14] you have not
[1:11:16] always. For in that she hath poured this
[1:11:19] ointment on my body, she did it for my
[1:11:22] burial."
[1:11:23] Not knowing what she was
[1:11:25] doing, she felt
[1:11:28] compelled to do something for this man,
[1:11:33] Jesus. For she for for in that I'll read
[1:11:36] it again. For in that she hath poured
[1:11:37] this ointment on my body. She did it for
[1:11:40] my
[1:11:42] burial. She didn't know what she was
[1:11:45] doing. Jesus was about to die. the next
[1:11:50] two days later, less than two days
[1:11:52] later, he was going to be dead on the
[1:11:55] cross. And he's saying that she's doing
[1:11:57] this and he wasn't going he didn't even
[1:12:00] get to be anointed. It was right at the
[1:12:02] Passover. They had to get him in the
[1:12:05] grave. And two men went down and and did
[1:12:07] it. That's why Mary Magdalene and they
[1:12:10] were coming later on to anoint him with
[1:12:13] the o with the oil. He says, "But she's
[1:12:16] doing it for me. I'm going to get
[1:12:20] anointed. Verily I say unto you,
[1:12:23] whosoever this gospel,
[1:12:26] whosoever this gospel shall be preached
[1:12:29] in the whole world, there shall also of
[1:12:32] this that this woman hath done be told
[1:12:35] for a memorial to
[1:12:38] her. Think about all the great people in
[1:12:42] the Bible. How Shamgar saved the Hebrews
[1:12:44] from the invading Philistines. great
[1:12:46] stories. How Samson killed a thousand
[1:12:49] Philistines with a jawbone of a of a
[1:12:51] donkey. How Gideon led like 300 soldiers
[1:12:55] in a battle against overwhelming odds
[1:12:57] and won. How the woman named Jail in the
[1:13:00] book of Judges. How she drove the tent
[1:13:02] stake through the head of the of the
[1:13:04] runaway king. These great stories. How
[1:13:08] Hannah cried at the altar for the Lord
[1:13:11] to give her a baby and then God heard
[1:13:13] her and gave her this great prophet
[1:13:15] Samuel.
[1:13:16] in the New Testament, how Peter and John
[1:13:18] healed the lame man at the gate called
[1:13:20] beautiful. All of these wonderful
[1:13:22] memorials that read, how Peter discerned
[1:13:24] the thoughts of Ananas and
[1:13:26] Safh. How Peter preached the day of
[1:13:28] Pentecost and thousands came to the
[1:13:30] Lord. How Paul cast out a demon of the
[1:13:33] witch, the woman that was possessed by
[1:13:35] the by the demon that was following him.
[1:13:38] How Paul was bitten by a poisonous snake
[1:13:40] and he threw it into the fire like
[1:13:42] nothing happened. How many times do we
[1:13:44] remember all of these great things that
[1:13:46] happened as a memorial? We preach on
[1:13:48] them all the time. But this
[1:13:51] woman that anointed Jesus with the
[1:13:57] oil, all those other ones that I
[1:13:59] mentioned and everybody else, who
[1:14:01] actually did something for Jesus
[1:14:04] himself, who actually had the
[1:14:08] honor of doing something for the son of
[1:14:12] God,
[1:14:15] giving him a little gift, giving him a
[1:14:18] little help. This ointment, it says how
[1:14:19] much it was, is probably pushing a
[1:14:21] year's salary,
[1:14:24] maybe. She spent all of this money. And
[1:14:26] you and I might be like, well, why is
[1:14:28] she spending this money like Judas
[1:14:30] was? But the one chance that someone got
[1:14:35] to do something for Jesus in the flesh
[1:14:38] and she did
[1:14:39] it. I don't know anyone that can compare
[1:14:41] to her.
[1:14:43] And he says that she'll this will be
[1:14:45] told for memorial to her for generations
[1:14:50] to come. And we're doing it right now.
[1:14:51] Fulfilling
[1:14:53] scripture. Whoever Peter, Paul, James,
[1:14:57] all of them, whoever actually did
[1:14:59] something for Jesus, he did he he did it
[1:15:02] for all of us. He he died on the cross
[1:15:05] for us. He heals our sickness. He does
[1:15:07] he does things all the time for us. But
[1:15:09] this woman actually got to do something
[1:15:12] for him.
[1:15:14] No wonder she spent so much money. That
[1:15:17] was her
[1:15:19] chance. Now she's immortalized as one of
[1:15:22] the few people that has ever actually
[1:15:25] done something for the son of
[1:15:27] God. We can today Jesus said, "If you
[1:15:31] want to do something for me, do it for
[1:15:33] my disciples. Do it for my
[1:15:35] children." But he was in the flesh
[1:15:38] then and she got to do it.
[1:15:43] then one of the
[1:15:48] 12. So she does
[1:15:51] this. Judas sees it. Here's the pivotal
[1:15:56] thing to me. Judas is
[1:15:59] watching. He sees her come in with this
[1:16:01] alabaster box that was
[1:16:05] probably
[1:16:07] $10,000 maybe in our money or more.
[1:16:10] She comes in with this. She breaks
[1:16:14] it. Nobody had washed his feet. Nobody
[1:16:17] had welcomed him. She breaks it and she
[1:16:20] puts
[1:16:21] this priceless ointment on his head and
[1:16:26] anoints him. And
[1:16:29] Jesus made him feel
[1:16:31] good. Helped him. Maybe the sun was was
[1:16:36] maybe he was sunburned. Maybe maybe he
[1:16:38] was tired.
[1:16:40] But it helped him and she got to do
[1:16:46] it. Judas was
[1:16:50] watching and it got to
[1:16:53] him. Things changed right there. He
[1:16:57] couldn't handle it anymore. What a
[1:16:58] waste. We could take all of that money
[1:17:01] and we could use it for something else.
[1:17:03] And John's like, "No, no, no. This guy's
[1:17:05] a crook anyways."
[1:17:07] But he said
[1:17:09] it. He thought it in his in his heart.
[1:17:12] Then one of the 12 called Judas his
[1:17:14] carrot went to the chief priests that
[1:17:16] put him over the
[1:17:18] top and said unto them, "What will you
[1:17:21] give me and I will deliver him unto
[1:17:25] you?" And they covenanted with him for
[1:17:27] 30 pieces of silver. And from that time
[1:17:30] he sought to he sought the opportunity
[1:17:32] to betray Jesus.
[1:17:38] All because this lady Mary, boy, she was
[1:17:41] she was great. She did it. And G and
[1:17:45] Judas resented
[1:17:47] it. And that's what turned his mind. And
[1:17:50] then he went after Jesus. And it ends up
[1:17:54] I told the story earlier. God bless you.
[1:17:56] If uh musicians would come and we'll
[1:18:00] close. So during this week we
[1:18:04] have I went through everything tomorrow,
[1:18:08] Thursday, Garden of Gethsemane and then
[1:18:10] Friday, Good Friday, Saturday and then
[1:18:14] the resurrection on
[1:18:16] Sunday. Think about it this week. Study
[1:18:18] it. Study the word this week. Put
[1:18:21] yourself in the position of the
[1:18:23] disciples.
[1:18:24] I would love I'll tell you what in this
[1:18:26] whole story there's one person I would
[1:18:28] want to be and that was Mary of Bethany.
[1:18:31] No matter Bible says before she was a
[1:18:34] sinner she had all kinds of problems in
[1:18:36] her
[1:18:39] life
[1:18:42] but we're still preaching about her and
[1:18:45] that's not going to change until until
[1:18:47] we come and go to heaven. Then we'll be
[1:18:49] able to meet her in person and thank her
[1:18:51] for her testimony. Thank her for what
[1:18:53] she did for
[1:19:03] Jesus. Down from his

[1:23:45] I think
[1:23:47] Mary was singing that
[1:23:50] song before Jesus went to the
[1:23:54] cross. Can you imagine that woman?
[1:23:58] You know how I love him, how I adore
[1:24:02] him, spending all of that
[1:24:05] money on that that
[1:24:10] oil and bringing it to the son of God.
[1:24:15] She got to do something.
[1:24:19] I have more
[1:24:20] respect for that little
[1:24:23] lady as much as anyone else in this
[1:24:27] whole story of the
[1:24:30] resurrection. And it was such a great
[1:24:32] act, such a such a great thing that
[1:24:36] Satan hated it so much. That was when
[1:24:39] Satan said enough is
[1:24:41] enough and sent his servant Judas's
[1:24:44] carrot out to destroy Jesus
[1:24:49] Christ. It was a pivotal time. Thank you
[1:24:53] friends for all of the the good input
[1:24:56] tonight. Boy, I enjoyed that. That was
[1:24:59] really, really good. Let's all stand.
[1:25:07] keep praying for
[1:25:09] Hano. He
[1:25:11] uh I was at the hospital today with him
[1:25:14] and I just love that family so
[1:25:17] much. He's he looks a little
[1:25:21] different. He's wheeling
[1:25:23] in on his
[1:25:26] wheelchair. He gave me a big smile. I
[1:25:30] looked at
[1:25:31] him. All of that hair is gone.
[1:25:37] is just the sweetest
[1:25:39] kid. He uh came in and we were talking
[1:25:43] and I really believe the Lord has a work
[1:25:47] for him to do. I believe the Lord has a
[1:25:49] work for all of us to do. I really do.
[1:25:51] And I look at each one each person here
[1:25:54] and I just it's like, "Oh yeah, the work
[1:25:56] has a the Lord has a work for him. The
[1:25:58] Lord has a work for her. The Lord has a
[1:26:00] He has a work for all of us. None of us
[1:26:01] are any greater than any of the other
[1:26:03] other ones. He loves us all and he will
[1:26:07] use us as much as we will surrender to
[1:26:09] him. Look at this little lady
[1:26:12] Mary. She had seen her brother raised
[1:26:15] from the dead. Jesus even told her that
[1:26:20] he appreciated her just listening to him
[1:26:22] when he talked.
[1:26:25] tells he tells Martha and Mary he says
[1:26:28] you know Mary Mary's Martha you work
[1:26:30] hard and you take care of
[1:26:32] me but she's more
[1:26:35] right and just listening to my
[1:26:38] words I think I just the story of this
[1:26:42] little lady I'll probably preach about
[1:26:43] it again on Easter morning but um just
[1:26:47] tremendous that she got to do something
[1:26:49] for Jesus and look what all that Jesus
[1:26:51] does for us now he's he's Great brother
[1:26:56] Josiah.

[1:28:05] testimony
[1:28:07] of your servant Mary of Bethany.

[1:28:15] grateful we can gather together and
[1:28:19] worship as the disciples of old did and
[1:28:22] honor your
[1:28:23] resurrection. Father, we pray that you'd
[1:28:26] be with us this
[1:28:28] week. Lord, bless each one.
[1:28:32] Father, I pray that
[1:28:34] Sunday, this resurrection
[1:28:37] morning, as we come together, if you
[1:28:39] would tarry that long, Lord, I pray that
[1:28:42] you would call
[1:28:45] souls to your
[1:28:48] kingdom. Father, that it would be a good
[1:28:51] service, service
[1:28:53] that would inspire many to give their
[1:28:57] hearts to Christ.
[1:29:00] Thank you Lord in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:29:06] All the saints and
[1:29:13] angels bow

[1:31:33] again.
[1:31:35] Jesus
[1:31:37] said he said that they shall lay hands
[1:31:40] on the sick and they shall recover.
[1:31:43] He taught us to pray for each other, to
[1:31:47] lay our hands on one another. So
[1:31:51] lay your hands on each
[1:31:53] other. Merily, would you go to Sister
[1:31:55] Sharon over
