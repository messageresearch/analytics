[20:07] again today to remove his ear on the
[20:09] right side due to the burns they were
[20:11] trying to save his eye as well as far as
[20:14] I know he's still in surgery the family
[20:16] said to keep praying they said they
[20:19] appreciate it and they feel the prayers
[20:22] and that is what is holding them
[20:23] together right now as they make these
[20:26] decisions so so brothers and sisters
[20:30] what greater Authority we could be a
[20:33] doctor we could be some sort of
[20:35] specialist but there's nothing greater
[20:37] than than bringing someone up before the
[20:39] Lord in prayer and let's continue to do
[20:41] that for this young man named
[20:44] Alex um I want to make a announcement

[23:36] what they're
[23:37] doing
[23:40] um I think that's all the announcements
[23:42] I have so on Wednesday nights brother
[23:45] Steve what we're doing is we are we have
[23:48] been doing a Bible study over the past
[23:50] year and we started with the book of
[23:52] Acts and we went chapter by chapter word
[23:56] by word through the entire book of of
[23:58] Acts it took us I don't know it took us
[24:00] 6 months or whatever it was and it was
[24:03] just such a blessing so I was praying
[24:06] about it and I thought let's just start
[24:08] in Genesis and we'll do this through the
[24:11] whole Bible so now we are devoting one
[24:14] service per book of the Bible so when we
[24:17] come in we can all know what the Book of
[24:20] Genesis is about what the book of Exodus
[24:22] and Leviticus is about just give us a
[24:25] broad overview of this
[24:28] so now we're devoting our Wednesday
[24:30] nights to a basic Bible Study last
[24:34] Wednesday we had I ministered on the
[24:37] first book of Kings we know that we had
[24:41] the end of David's life and David handed
[24:44] the kingdom over to his son Solomon
[24:47] Solomon reigned for 40 years and then
[24:50] Solomon towards the end of his life he
[24:52] began to
[24:54] stray and he had when he passed away his
[24:58] son rabam took over the kingdom split
[25:02] into the North and the South we had
[25:05] Judah and the South we had Israel up in
[25:06] the north and we left it with this man
[25:12] named Elijah stepping on the scene one
[25:16] of the greatest prophets that the world
[25:18] has ever seen as as I said we had one of
[25:21] the most evil Kings and the Bible even
[25:24] said he was the most evil King to that
[25:27] point that had ever been this man named
[25:29] Ahab and his wife was even eviler than
[25:32] than he was this woman named Jezebel and
[25:35] but when the enemy comes in like a flood
[25:38] God raises up a standard against it and
[25:40] he raised up this man Elijah to stand
[25:43] against this King named Ahab so we
[25:47] closed out with the towards the end of
[25:50] Elijah's Ministry and now brother
[25:53] brother ly will bring us into second
[25:56] Kings and that we'll see the um end of
[25:59] Elijah's Ministry and the start of
[26:02] Elisha the the Elisha's whole Ministry
[26:05] and we will go into the Kings but before
[26:08] we get
[26:09] there let's all
[26:12] stand and I
[26:15] would if you'd all bow your
[26:17] heads I would like us to pray for this
[26:21] young man
[26:24] Alex pray
[26:26] for as brother Aaron mentioned brother
[26:29] Aaron's parents both of them could use
[26:32] our prayers also remember brother Jeremy
[26:34] sister Angela and this
[26:38] great burden that they have and this
[26:41] great honor that they have in taking
[26:43] these children in that the Lord would
[26:45] give them wisdom
[26:47] and may they plant a seed in these kids
[26:51] that will BL them their whole
[26:53] life at seed of the Holy Spirit and the
[26:56] word of God
[26:59] and if you would have a request that's
[27:00] on your heart if you could make it known
[27:04] to the Lord with an uplifted
[27:08] hand
[27:10] Lord you know our
[27:14] needs but father you also required that
[27:17] we would bring our needs to you in
[27:21] prayer one for
[27:24] another Lord we ask for your mercies
[27:28] upon this young man
[27:30] Alex and Lord

[27:37] to him and the burns and how they've
[27:40] covered his body father we pray that the
[27:43] great physician would come in and deal
[27:46] with him Lord of course with his body
[27:49] but most of all Lord that you would deal
[27:51] with his
[27:52] soul and that he would know the Lord
[27:55] Jesus and Lord we we don't know why
[27:58] these things happen but we pray that it
[28:00] would be to bring him closer to you
[28:03] father we pray for his family that you
[28:05] would give them strength and Lord may
[28:07] they their desires go to a living Jesus
[28:10] Christ a living

[28:17] lifted up their
[28:18] hands Lord that it wouldn't just be
[28:21] something a tradition but it would
[28:23] father be that that hand was raised in
[28:27] faith and that you would look down and
[28:28] see a raised hand and that you would
[28:31] answer the prayers that were represented
[28:33] with that
[28:34] hand father we pray that your blessings
[28:36] would be upon our Renovations in our
[28:40] church Lord that it would be according
[28:42] to your will that every decision that
[28:44] would be made that it would be Lord your
[28:48] decision and not ours we
[28:51] pray strengthen us Lord and may we be

[30:55] Christ looks like it's the right slide
[30:57] tonight okay tonight we look at the book
[30:59] of Second Kings which covers a time
[31:01] period of around 270 years from about
[31:05] 855 BC at the death of King Ahab to
[31:10] about 587 BC with the destruction of
[31:12] Solomon's Temple we'll approach the
[31:14] study a little differently I won't give
[31:16] you a chapter by chapter summary uh and
[31:20] I didn't bring a copy of the daily
[31:22] parchment so I can't read you the
[31:23] headlines from that this time like we
[31:25] did for 2 Samuel but
[31:27] remember what we're presenting here in
[31:30] this series of the books of the Bible
[31:32] are overviews in one evening we just get
[31:35] glimpses of what each book contains
[31:37] seeing evidence of Jesus as the Messiah
[31:42] and finding at least one take-home
[31:44] thought or lesson to help us not just in
[31:47] our knowledge of biblical Israel but in

[33:30] help us to be focused and concentrating
[33:33] and we thank you and that name above
[33:36] every name the name of our Lord Jesus
[33:39] Christ
[33:43] amen we're going to start our lesson
[33:45] with with a few verses
[33:47] from
[33:49] Genesis Jacob is fleeing from Esau he
[33:53] he's on his way to Syria and he sleeps
[33:55] along the road he's he's gone about 50
[33:57] mil from home in Bev he's about 10 miles
[33:59] north of what will be
[34:01] Jerusalem he lays down by the side of
[34:04] the road he has a dream of a ladder
[34:08] reaching up to heaven and God is
[34:10] speaking to him Genesis 28 verse1 15 God
[34:13] says and behold I am with thee and will
[34:16] keep thee in all places whether thou
[34:18] goest and will bring thee again into
[34:21] this land for I will not leave thee
[34:24] until I have done that which I have SP
[34:26] spoken to thee
[34:29] of and Jacob awake out of his sleep and
[34:32] he said surely the the Lord's in this
[34:34] place and I I I didn't know it he was
[34:37] afraid he said how Dreadful this place
[34:40] is there's none other but the the house
[34:42] of God the Gate of
[34:46] Heaven and Jacob rose up early in the
[34:48] morning and took the stone that he had
[34:50] put for his pillows and set it up for a
[34:53] pillar and poured oil on the top of it
[34:57] and he called the name of that place
[35:00] betel betel means bet means House El God
[35:04] house of God this is where God dwells
[35:06] this is his home but the name of that
[35:09] city was called L at the
[35:12] first please be
[35:14] seated as we study Second Kings you'll
[35:18] see that this place where Jacob slept
[35:20] beel plays a pivotal role in the history
[35:24] of Israel and Judah
[35:27] note it it's often confusing to hear the
[35:30] words Israel and Judah Israel is a name
[35:33] given to Jacob it's a name used to
[35:35] describe the people descended from Jacob
[35:37] in the Bible up until the time that this
[35:40] kingdom is
[35:41] split so I want to hopefully help reduce
[35:45] a little the confusion it's the name of
[35:47] the Modern Nation in the Middle East
[35:49] that we call Israel shown on the left of
[35:51] the
[35:52] screen once the ancient kingdom is is
[35:55] split it's as happened in First Kings
[35:58] the northern part continues to be called
[36:01] Israel this is the area shaded in light
[36:04] green on the right side of the screen a
[36:06] king of Israel rules this territory the
[36:10] southern part takes on the name of Judah
[36:13] this is shaded in lavender on the lower
[36:15] right part of the screen a king of Judah
[36:18] rules this
[36:19] territory I'll try to be clear about
[36:21] this as we go but for tonight's lesson
[36:24] in Second Kings the once you United
[36:27] Kingdom has been divided into these two
[36:29] Nations Israel and
[36:32] Judah please note the three red circles
[36:35] on the map at the right you don't have
[36:37] to read the names inside of them you
[36:38] can't from there and I can't from here
[36:40] but the upper one is the city of Dan and
[36:44] you can see in the Green Space it's way
[36:46] up at the northern
[36:48] tip of the area of the territory of
[36:51] Israel the other two are bethl and
[36:55] Jerusalem it's a little hard to see so
[36:57] let me let me zoom in for
[36:59] you here we see bethl that's near the
[37:02] center here it's just at the southern
[37:04] end of the territory of Israel just
[37:05] outside the area of Judah this is where
[37:09] Jacob slept that that we just read it's
[37:12] and about 10 miles it's only 10 miles
[37:15] from bethl to Jerusalem that's where
[37:16] Solomon built the temple which is in
[37:19] Judah and then finally just to add a
[37:22] little interest to the mix I put a a
[37:24] yellow circle around a town called
[37:27] Samaria this city is the capital of
[37:32] Israel when Second Kings refers to
[37:35] Samaria it's referring to this city when
[37:38] Second Kings refers to Samaritans it's
[37:41] referring to Residence of this city a
[37:45] Siege of Samaria means that this city is
[37:48] surrounded by an enemy
[37:51] Army ready to move
[37:54] on okay let's go the United Kingdom of
[37:57] all 12 Tribes of Jacob's descendants
[37:59] lasted for 120 years ruled by Saul for
[38:02] 40 years David for 40 years Solomon for
[38:05] 40 years after that it was divided into
[38:08] Israel and Judah do you recall
[38:14] why First Kings 11 verse 9 the Lord was
[38:18] angry with Solomon because his heart was
[38:21] turned from the Lord God of Israel which
[38:23] had appeared unto him twice and had come
[38:26] commanded him concerning this thing that
[38:28] he should not go after other gods but he
[38:32] kept not that which the Lord
[38:34] commanded wherefore the Lord said unto
[38:37] Solomon for as much as this is done of
[38:39] thee in other words it's on you Solomon
[38:43] and thou Hast not kept my commandment
[38:45] and my statuts which I have commanded
[38:47] Thee I will surely Rend the Kingdom from
[38:50] thee and will give it to thy servant not
[38:53] your son your servant this is all about
[38:57] obedience it's not about privilege it's
[39:00] not about
[39:02] entitlement notwithstanding in thy days
[39:05] I will not do it for David thy father's
[39:08] sake but I will Rend it I'll tear it
[39:11] I'll rip it out of the hand of thy son
[39:16] how be it I will not Rend away all the
[39:19] kingdom but I will give One Tribe to thy
[39:22] son for David my servant's sake and for
[39:26] jerus M sake which I have
[39:30] chosen brother Daniel taught from First
[39:32] Kings last Wednesday and told how
[39:34] Solomon's son rabam followed some really
[39:37] bad advice and caused the nation to
[39:41] split 10 lines of Jacob's descendants
[39:44] set up their own Nation called Israel
[39:47] leaving rabo to rule the territories of
[39:50] Judah and
[39:53] Simeon Israel had a succession of bad
[39:57] kings there's not one of their kings
[40:00] they had that was good although some of
[40:02] them seemed to be good for a little
[40:03] while but but there was a problem that
[40:05] we'll discuss this evening all of them
[40:08] offended the Lord last week we saw how
[40:11] judgment fell on King Ahab and a
[40:13] prophecy came that his entire line of
[40:15] heirs would be killed that his wife
[40:18] Jezebel would literally be eaten by dogs
[40:22] now don't be afraid if you come and
[40:23] visit our house our dog's only this big
[40:26] he's not going to cause you a problem
[40:27] we're talking about some large
[40:29] canines recall in in First Kings
[40:33] 17 Elijah the tishbite a prophet appears
[40:37] and he declares a drought the drought
[40:39] lasts three and a half years second king
[40:42] says three years but when Jesus talks
[40:44] about it he clarifies that it was three
[40:46] and a half years we're all familiar with
[40:48] The Showdown on Mount Carmel well where
[40:50] the Lord sent fire to consume a burnt
[40:52] offering Elijah kills 450 prophets of
[40:56] baale and 400 prophets of what's called
[41:00] The Groves says all of which eat at
[41:03] Jezebel's table not ahab's table
[41:06] Jezebel's table now now a Grove here
[41:09] doesn't mean a copes of trees I have an
[41:11] Olive Grove it's not talking about that
[41:13] it's talking about an idol something
[41:15] that's been carved that's been engraved
[41:18] whether it's of stone whether it's of
[41:19] wood whether it's cast of molten metal
[41:23] it's talking about Idols when it talks
[41:25] about grow
[41:27] well rain comes to end the drought
[41:29] Elijah flees from
[41:31] Jezebel arriving eventually at Mount Orb
[41:34] also called called Mount Si turns out
[41:37] it's about 300 miles and it's in a cave
[41:41] there at Mount hor I wonder if it could
[41:44] have been a a cave that Moses had been
[41:46] in during his 40 days that he was there
[41:49] receiving the law but anyway we read
[41:51] that Elijah responds to the Lord who
[41:55] speaks to him and a quiet voice a still
[42:00] Small Voice Elijah was discouraged
[42:04] convinced he he's the only person
[42:06] following the Lord Lord take my life I'm
[42:09] the only one that's left the Lord
[42:11] admonishes him and says Elijah there are
[42:13] still 7,000 that haven't bowed the knee
[42:15] to bail 7,000 sounds like a lot but
[42:19] that's a tiny fraction probably less
[42:20] than
[42:22] 1% of the overall population of Israel
[42:25] they have really devolved really
[42:28] devolved in a short period of time in 80
[42:30] years from the time of Solomon to the
[42:32] time we're
[42:33] at but the Lord told him more than that
[42:38] first
[42:39] Kings 19 there we are verse 15 and the
[42:44] Lord said unto Elijah go return on thy
[42:47] way to the Wilderness of Damascus and
[42:50] when thou comest anoint heel to be king
[42:53] over Syria and juu the son of nimshi
[42:57] shall th anoint to be king over Israel
[43:00] and Elisha the son of shaffat of Abal
[43:03] mahola shalt thou anoint to be prophet
[43:06] in thy
[43:07] room and as we'll find reading later
[43:10] that it was actually Elisha that
[43:12] anointed hael and anointed
[43:15] juu well a little time passes and Elijah
[43:19] confronts Ahab telling him all his male
[43:21] descendants will be killed and then and
[43:25] if J jeel also spake the Lord saying the
[43:28] dog shall eat Jezebel by the wall of
[43:31] Jezreel him that dieth of Ahab that's
[43:33] not who Ahab kills but he's talking
[43:35] about ahab's descendants of your
[43:37] descendants that die in the city the
[43:40] dogs will eat him that dies in the field
[43:42] shall the fowls of the air eat they they
[43:45] won't get a decent
[43:47] burial these are horrific
[43:50] ends Ahab
[43:52] repents God tells Elijah the judgment
[43:55] will be delayed and until after Ahab
[43:57] dies he won't have to see it the
[43:59] judgment's going to come but Ahab won't
[44:01] have to personally experience it it'll
[44:04] come in the days of his sons and this
[44:07] brings us to Second
[44:09] Kings it opens with Elijah denouncing
[44:12] aazia ahab's successor who dies after
[44:15] reigning for only about a year meanwhile
[44:18] in Judah after 20 years of bad
[44:20] leadership under rabam and his son
[44:24] deijah a good King comes to the throne a
[44:26] fellow named ASA and and he's succeeded
[44:29] by Jehoshaphat who's another good ruler
[44:32] in
[44:34] Judah now you got
[44:37] that you've memorized all that you have
[44:40] the kind of a memory no neither do I I
[44:43] realize this chart's very busy it
[44:46] summarizes the various Kings after the
[44:47] United Kingdom is ripped apart there's
[44:49] there's a red line at the bottom and
[44:51] that's the transition from First Kings
[44:52] to Second Kings you notice on the left
[44:55] of the chart that there's a list of
[44:58] names that are difficult to see because
[45:00] most of you are sitting too far back but
[45:02] but it it it's a list of the various
[45:04] prophets that appear in the
[45:07] text these are all what we call oral
[45:09] prophets they have left no writings that
[45:11] have survived but we see that the Lord
[45:14] was continually present during this
[45:16] period continually present warning and
[45:19] admonishing he wasn't left without a
[45:21] witness he wasn't left not trying to get
[45:24] the people to come back to to him the
[45:27] two rightand columns list the Kings of
[45:30] Israel and the kings of Judah the the
[45:31] lengths of the Reign are shown along
[45:33] with the years that we know is BC don't
[45:35] worry about trying to read or absorb all
[45:37] of it I I wanted you to see that from
[45:39] the time the kingdom divided first king
[45:42] covers about 80 years some Kings ruled
[45:45] less than a year some as long as 40
[45:47] years and that God always had Witnesses
[45:49] in the form of a prophet trying to get
[45:51] the people and their leaders back to
[45:54] worshiping the Lord
[45:58] you can notice by some names there's a
[45:59] little red thing it looks like a little
[46:01] Red Devil with a pitchfork though that
[46:03] represents those kings were not so good
[46:05] not so good some of them have a little
[46:08] green check mark with a halo over their
[46:09] head that means they they were the good
[46:11] guys okay so you can see Israel is full
[46:14] of bad guys and Judah gets some good
[46:16] guys from time to time that's a good
[46:18] thing well let's move
[46:21] on so there we
[46:24] go so Elijah we're now in the first part
[46:27] of this book of second king he should be
[46:29] taken up by the Lord and He tests Elijah
[46:32] by continually advising him to stay
[46:35] behind when Elijah travels on their
[46:37] their first stop red circle up there
[46:39] that yellow arrow their first stop is
[46:41] gilgal and Elijah says Elisha you stay
[46:44] here I I've got business to do down at
[46:47] bethl and Elisha said M no no you go I
[46:52] go so the next stop is bethl which we
[46:55] introduced in our first scripture
[46:57] reading this evening a group called sons
[47:00] of prophets tell Elisha that Elijah will
[47:03] be taken from him that day Elisha
[47:05] refuses to leave Elijah's side the third
[47:07] stop is Jericho and there's another
[47:10] group there that tells him the same
[47:11] thing the four stop is the Jordan River
[47:15] they get to the
[47:17] Jordan Elijah divides the waters and
[47:19] they
[47:20] cross 2 Kings 2:9 it came to pass when
[47:24] they were gone over that Elijah said to
[47:28] Elisha ask what I shall do for thee
[47:31] before I be taken away from thee and
[47:34] Elisha said I pray thee let a double
[47:37] portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he
[47:40] said thou has asked a hard thing and
[47:44] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[47:46] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[47:49] but if not it shall not be so it came to
[47:53] pass as they still went on and Tau Ed
[47:56] that behold there appeared a chariot of
[47:58] fire and Horses of
[48:01] fire and parted them both
[48:04] aund and Elijah went up not in the fiery
[48:08] Chariot but by a whirlwind into
[48:12] heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my
[48:15] father my father The Chariot of Israel
[48:18] and the horsemen
[48:19] thereof and he saw him no
[48:22] more he took hold of his own clothes and
[48:25] r them in two
[48:27] pieces brother brandom used this story
[48:30] of Elijah and Elisha many times in his
[48:32] sermons I'd like to read a short excerpt
[48:34] from one of them called Witnesses it was
[48:37] spoken on uh April the 5th 1953 in the
[48:42] evening he says then he that's Elijah
[48:46] started from gilgal and he went on to
[48:48] the school of the prophets and I want
[48:50] you to notice when he got there at the
[48:52] school of the prophets he said the
[48:54] Lord's leading me to Jordan
[48:56] three stages that Elisha followed Elijah
[48:59] and Elijah was a type of Christ Elisha
[49:03] the type of the
[49:05] church I go up to gilgal First
[49:08] justification by faith and then he said
[49:11] now you stay here to the church Elijah
[49:14] Elisha to Elijah the young and old
[49:17] Prophet a type of Christ and the
[49:20] church he Elisha said as your soul lives
[49:24] I'll not stay here
[49:26] I'm going with
[49:27] you he went up to gilgal and when he got
[49:30] up there he Elijah said now now you stay
[49:34] here the the Lord's calling me up to the
[49:36] school of the prophets so he Elisha said
[49:40] as the Lord lives as your soul never die
[49:43] I'm going with you I'll not leave you
[49:46] that's the
[49:47] church he says keep your eyes on your
[49:50] pastor oh wait no it's not what it says
[49:54] um keep your eyes on the prophet oh no
[49:58] it doesn't say that either the
[50:00] Evangelist the
[50:02] teacher the person that led you to the
[50:04] Lord your favorite preacher a Christian
[50:08] influencer on YouTube or Tik
[50:10] Tok your Google search
[50:13] results no what did he say keep your
[50:17] eyes on Jesus wherever he moves
[50:24] go he says if he goes out of the
[50:27] Methodist Church go right on with him if
[50:31] he goes out of the Baptist Church go
[50:34] right on with him if he goes out of the
[50:37] brandom
[50:38] Tabernacle go right on with him I will
[50:42] not leave you no matter where Mama
[50:45] belonged where Papa belonged where this
[50:48] happened or another I'll go with you
[50:52] I'll not leave you Hallelujah he says I
[50:55] am your witness I can't go you're a part
[50:59] of me come on I'll
[51:02] follow and he goes to the school the
[51:05] prophets and he says oh you you stay
[51:08] here and some of the prophets said to
[51:10] Elisha he said do you know your master
[51:13] will be taken from you he said I know it
[51:16] hold your peace amen I like that I'm
[51:20] going to stay right with him no matter
[51:21] what the rest of them
[51:23] say and Elijah turned turned around and
[51:26] said now you Terry here God sending me
[51:28] to Jordan three places justification
[51:31] gilgal sanctification the school of the
[51:34] Prophet to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:36] at Jordan where the Jordan represents
[51:38] death we know that means death to
[51:41] self well back to Second Kings Elijah
[51:44] just went
[51:45] up Elisha then crosses over the Jordan
[51:49] parting the river with Elijah's Mantle
[51:51] that that's his robe his cloak and
[51:54] regarding the double portion we find
[51:57] that there are twice as many
[51:58] Supernatural things recorded about
[52:00] Elisha's Ministry than
[52:04] Elijah's type of
[52:07] Christ type of the
[52:09] church you should remember what Jesus
[52:12] said you'll do more miracles than me
[52:14] greater than this shall you do because I
[52:16] go to the father so here again we see a
[52:19] type of Elisha is the church doing more
[52:22] miracles than Elijah as a type of
[52:27] Christ Elisha performs several Miracles
[52:30] as time moves along and then a curious
[52:33] thing happens God performs a miracle of
[52:37] healing on one of Israel's
[52:40] enemies second Kings chapter
[52:42] 5 now non captain of the host in other
[52:46] words general of the army of the king
[52:48] that's Ben Hadad of Syria was a great
[52:51] man with his master and honorable
[52:54] because by him the Lord had given
[52:57] Deliverance unto
[53:00] Syria remember when we read in that
[53:02] Psalm and it said seah means stop think
[53:05] about that think about that delivered
[53:08] Syria from Israel the Lord did that he
[53:12] was also a mighty man in Valor but he
[53:15] was a
[53:16] leper and the syrians had gone out by
[53:18] companies and had brought away captive
[53:20] out of the land of Israel a little maid
[53:23] and she waited on non wife so the
[53:26] captured Israelite became a house slave
[53:30] to non's
[53:32] wife and she said unto her mistress
[53:35] would God my Lord were with the prophet
[53:38] that is in Samaria for he would recover
[53:41] him of his
[53:44] leprosy well non goes to Israel with a
[53:49] lot of gold and a lot of stuff he offers
[53:52] the king a huge bounty to heal kill him
[53:56] the king's distraught he's thinking that
[53:58] Syria's trying to find an excuse to
[54:01] start another war with Israel they
[54:03] didn't do so good last time Elisha says
[54:06] the king don't worry send him over here
[54:09] and he'll show non that there is a
[54:12] prophet in
[54:13] Israel hey King you should be listening
[54:15] to me because watch watch what's going
[54:17] to happen non comes Elisha tells him to
[54:20] wash himself in the Jordan River seven
[54:23] times and his leprosy will be
[54:26] healed what did Jesus
[54:29] say this is a type of the church Elisha
[54:32] he said pray for them that persecute you
[54:34] and despitefully use you do good to your
[54:38] enemies well non's angry at first says
[54:42] there better rivers in the Jordan near
[54:44] Damascus where I come from I don't want

[54:52] servants convinced him that look he
[54:54] didn't ask you to do do some great thing
[54:55] he just said jump in the water seven
[54:57] times what's the big deal so non gives
[55:01] in he does that goes in goes out nothing
[55:05] goes in goes out nothing six times
[55:09] nothing seventh time comes out totally
[55:13] restored totally

[55:27] at
[55:28] me there was something in his heart he
[55:31] returned to the man of God he and all
[55:33] his company and came and stood before
[55:36] Elisha and he said behold now I know
[55:40] that there is no God in all the Earth
[55:43] but in
[55:44] Israel now therefore I pray thee take a
[55:47] blessing of thy servant I got a lot of
[55:50] money I'm going to give you a lot of
[55:51] wealth you'll be set for
[55:53] life notice
[55:55] Israel saw Miracle after miracle and
[55:58] worshiped other gods anyway here's this
[56:02] Syrian an enemy worshiping who knows
[56:04] which gods but he experienced a miracle
[56:07] through obedience and
[56:10] humility and now realizes the truth he
[56:15] becomes a witness for the god of
[56:18] Israel and what had Elisha said that he
[56:21] would know there was a prophet in the
[56:23] land a prophet of the one true
[56:27] God Elisha refuses the gift freely have
[56:31] you receive freely give but gazi
[56:34] Elisha's servant then goes him and says
[56:37] hey how about a little I I got some
[56:39] friends and they need a little money
[56:40] wink
[56:41] wink Elisha finds out and gazi then
[56:45] receives not only non's little gift but
[56:48] he receives non's
[56:52] leprosy oops
[56:57] you recall from First Kings during that
[56:59] three and a half year drought Elijah
[57:01] went to a widow of sidon and stayed with
[57:04] her and her son and a miracle of
[57:06] continually replenished flour and oil
[57:08] occurred to sustain the three of them
[57:10] I've marked on the map there were Sid as
[57:12] you notice it's beyond the territory of
[57:15] Israel um
[57:18] it's in fact it's the place where
[57:20] Jezebel's
[57:22] from so it's I've circled it in red near
[57:25] the top of the map I circled Jerusalem
[57:28] for
[57:29] reference Jezebel the wife and
[57:31] influencer of Ahab at that time was as I
[57:33] said from siden but notice Elijah is
[57:36] staying in Gentile territory outside the
[57:39] land of Israel and sustaining a gentile
[57:42] Widow and her
[57:44] son here's what Jesus said about these
[57:48] two Miracles speaking in his hometown
[57:50] synagogue Luke 4:24 and Jesus said
[57:54] verily I say unto you no Prophet is
[57:58] accepted in his own
[58:00] country and now he gives an example from
[58:03] First Kings he was here last Wednesday
[58:06] night brother he was here here we are I
[58:10] tell you of a truth many widows were in
[58:14] Israel in the Days of Elijah when the
[58:16] heaven was shut up three years and six
[58:21] months when Great Famine was throughout
[58:25] all the
[58:26] land but unto none of them was Elijah
[58:30] sent save unto Serta a city of sidon
[58:34] unto a woman that was a
[58:38] widow he goes
[58:40] on he talks about Second Kings many
[58:45] lepers were in Israel in the time of
[58:48] elishah the
[58:50] prophet and none of them was cleansed
[58:53] saving non the
[58:57] Syrian people don't like hearing that
[58:59] you know the story well shortly after
[59:02] non's healing the syrians under benh
[59:04] Hadad put the city of Samaria Under
[59:07] Siege it gets to be really really bad
[59:10] and then God miraculously scatters the
[59:13] syrians and after that Elisha makes his
[59:15] way to
[59:16] Damascus benh Hadad the king of Syria
[59:19] the guy that had sieged the city and
[59:21] done all this trouble he's sick and he
[59:24] hears Elisha's in
[59:27] town so he asks hael to inquire if he
[59:31] will recover ask this Prophet if if I'm
[59:34] going
[59:35] to get
[59:37] better 2 Kings 8:10 Elisha said unto
[59:41] haziel go say unto benh
[59:45] Hadad thou mayest certainly
[59:48] recover how be it the Lord has showed
[59:52] me that he shall surely die
[59:56] and Elisha settled his countenance
[59:58] steadfastly he stared at haziel for a
[1:00:01] long time just stared at
[1:00:04] him until hael was was ashamed he was
[1:00:07] embarrassed and finally staring at
[1:00:11] AEL Elisha began to
[1:00:14] cry he started to
[1:00:18] weep and haziel said why weepeth my Lord
[1:00:23] and Elisha answered
[1:00:26] answered because I I know the evil that
[1:00:29] thou wil do unto the children of Israel
[1:00:32] that their strongholds will without set
[1:00:34] on fire their young men you'll slay with
[1:00:38] a sword you'll Dash their
[1:00:40] children rip up the pregnant
[1:00:46] women and has El said but but what is
[1:00:50] thy servant a dog that he should do this
[1:00:52] great thing and Elisha answered
[1:00:55] the Lord has showed me that thou shalt
[1:00:58] be king over
[1:01:02] Syria hael returns to badad tells him
[1:01:06] yeah you you you should get better the
[1:01:08] Elisha said you should recover and then
[1:01:11] hael murders him that night takes the
[1:01:14] Throne of
[1:01:15] Syria two of the three things that God
[1:01:18] told Elijah in a still Small Voice in
[1:01:22] the cave at Horeb have come to pass
[1:01:23] Elisha has succeeded Elijah has the ell
[1:01:26] is been anointed king of Syria now comes
[1:01:29] the third and last
[1:01:35] item backt track to or forward track to
[1:01:39] 2 Kings n Elisha the prophet called one
[1:01:43] of the children of the
[1:01:45] prophets and said unto him G up thy
[1:01:48] loins take this box of oil in thine hand
[1:01:52] and go to remote Gilead and when thou
[1:01:54] comest thither look out there yahu the
[1:01:56] son of Jehoshaphat the son of nimi and
[1:01:59] go in and make him arise from among his
[1:02:01] Brethren and and lead him to an inner
[1:02:03] chamber to a private
[1:02:06] room then take the box of oil pour it on
[1:02:10] his head and say thus sayeth the Lord I
[1:02:13] have anointed thee King over Israel and
[1:02:17] then young man open the door flee T not
[1:02:21] run for your life don't just Girt up
[1:02:23] your loins be sure you got your track
[1:02:25] shoes
[1:02:26] on so the young man even the young man
[1:02:30] the
[1:02:31] prophet went to remote
[1:02:34] Gilead and when he came behold the
[1:02:36] captains of the host were that's of the
[1:02:38] army were sitting and and he said I have
[1:02:41] an errand to thee O Captain and J said
[1:02:45] and to which of all of us and he said to
[1:02:48] thee Oh
[1:02:49] Captain juu arose and went to the house
[1:02:54] and he the the young Prophet poured oil
[1:02:57] on jah's head and said unto him thus
[1:03:00] sayith the Lord God of Israel I have
[1:03:02] anointed thee King over the people of
[1:03:05] the Lord even over Israel but he goes on
[1:03:09] and thou shalt Smite the house of Ahab
[1:03:11] thy master that I may Avenge the blood
[1:03:13] of my servants the prophets and the
[1:03:14] blood of all the Servants of the Lord at
[1:03:16] the hand of Jezebel for the whole house
[1:03:19] of Ahab Shall Perish I will cut off from
[1:03:22] Ahab him that pisseth against the wall
[1:03:23] and him that is shut up and left in
[1:03:25] Israel and I will make the house of Ahab
[1:03:28] like the house of jeroboam the son of
[1:03:29] nebat and like the house of Basha the
[1:03:32] son of
[1:03:33] aijah and the dogs shall eat Jezebel and
[1:03:36] the portion of Jezreel and there shall
[1:03:38] be none to bury her and the young
[1:03:41] Prophet opened the door and fled ran for
[1:03:45] his
[1:03:47] life J's men say what went on he tells
[1:03:50] them and they declare him
[1:03:52] King J then gets and his Chariot heads
[1:03:56] from Samaria to Jezreel and he
[1:03:58] assassinates the king yoram one of
[1:04:00] ahab's sons hesia the king of Judah
[1:04:05] happens to be visiting joram beu takes
[1:04:08] the opportunity and kills him
[1:04:12] too verse 30 when J was come to Jezreel
[1:04:17] Jezebel heard of it and she painted her
[1:04:19] face and fixed her hair and looked out a
[1:04:23] window Oh my he had another weak man for
[1:04:27] me to
[1:04:29] manipulate oh mirror mirror on the
[1:04:33] wall as as juu entered in at the gate
[1:04:36] she said a very curious
[1:04:39] thing had zimy peace who slew his
[1:04:43] master well you've you've been reading
[1:04:45] your Bibles at home so you know that
[1:04:47] that back in First Kings
[1:04:49] 16 that uh a fellow named zy killed the
[1:04:52] house of basa just like J Who was who's
[1:04:54] been killing the house of Ahab and then
[1:04:56] he only lived another seven days then he
[1:04:58] was killed and the prophet that
[1:05:01] predicted this was coincidentally named
[1:05:04] J so she's teasing and taunting J she
[1:05:09] knows what's going
[1:05:12] on and he lifted up his face to the
[1:05:14] window and said who's on my side who and
[1:05:19] and they looked out to him two or three
[1:05:21] unic and he said throw her down
[1:05:26] so they threw her down some of her blood
[1:05:28] was sprinkled on the wall and on the
[1:05:30] horses maybe she was dead when she
[1:05:32] landed from the impact may maybe not but
[1:05:35] he troed her underfoot on his horse
[1:05:38] stomped her this is violent
[1:05:43] stuff made sure that she was dead and
[1:05:47] what did he do after that he goes in and
[1:05:49] did eat and drink oh that's been a long
[1:05:51] day I'm a little hungry right now
[1:05:57] all in a day's work oh oh go go go now
[1:06:02] see this cursed woman bury her for she
[1:06:05] is a King's Daughter he respected her as
[1:06:08] a daughter of a foreign King not as the
[1:06:11] wife of his former
[1:06:13] King and they went to bury her but they
[1:06:16] found no more of her than the skull and
[1:06:18] the feet and the palms of her hands
[1:06:21] wherefore they came again and told him
[1:06:23] told J and juu and he said oh this is
[1:06:26] the word of the Lord which he spake by
[1:06:28] his servant Elijah the tishbites saying
[1:06:31] and the portion of jezrael shall dogs
[1:06:33] eat the Flesh of Jezebel and the carcass
[1:06:35] of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the
[1:06:37] face of the field in the porch of
[1:06:39] Jezreel so that they shall not say this
[1:06:41] is Jezebel she'll have no tomb she'll
[1:06:44] have no Shrine there won't be any people
[1:06:47] coming to lay flowers at her
[1:06:49] grave juu does many of the things the
[1:06:52] Lord asks of him ju is zealous
[1:06:56] but he also has those fatal flaws he
[1:06:59] continues to worship other gods and
[1:07:01] leave intact all the idols and practices
[1:07:04] which the Lord AB
[1:07:08] bores sorry and another busy chart but
[1:07:11] this shows the uh the Kings from juu to
[1:07:15] the conquest of Israel so this word says
[1:07:17] Israel Kings the little green up there
[1:07:19] is J's Reign and it comes down you see
[1:07:21] some of those guys didn't last very long
[1:07:23] one guy jeroboam II who was a bad guy
[1:07:26] and yet the Lord used him to save
[1:07:30] Israel uh for a time until we get down
[1:07:32] to 723 when they're carried off into
[1:07:36] captivity uh many of these guys are only
[1:07:39] mentioned in a few verses of Second
[1:07:40] Kings but there's one phrase that's
[1:07:43] repeated over and over and over of
[1:07:46] virtually every of one of the Kings of
[1:07:48] Israel we'll just read from one of them
[1:07:51] 2 Kings 15 and he could have been any of
[1:07:55] the various Kings in Israel did that
[1:07:57] which was evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:08:00] he departed not from the sins of
[1:08:03] jeroboam the son of nebat who made
[1:08:06] Israel to
[1:08:07] sin a few of the kings of Judah did the
[1:08:10] same we read in in 2 Kings 16 about this
[1:08:13] particular king of Judah named ahaz ahaz
[1:08:17] walked in the way of the Kings of Israel
[1:08:20] yay ahaz made his son to pass through
[1:08:23] through the
[1:08:25] fire according to the Abominations of
[1:08:28] the Heathen whom the Lord cast out from
[1:08:29] before the children of Israel and he has
[1:08:32] sacrificed and burnt incense in the high
[1:08:34] places and on the hills and under every
[1:08:36] Green
[1:08:40] Tree going back to that chart you
[1:08:44] notice
[1:08:46] Jonah during the time there of jeroboam
[1:08:50] II Second Kings records a prophecy of
[1:08:53] Jonah that the Lord saved Israel by the
[1:08:55] hand of jeroboam too who was still
[1:08:58] another king who did a lot of bad stuff
[1:09:01] it says 2 Kings 14:25 that Jonah the son
[1:09:04] of amiti the
[1:09:07] Prophet could that be the same
[1:09:11] Jonah Jonah 1 now the word of the Lord
[1:09:15] came into Jonah the son of
[1:09:17] amiti yeah so this places Jonah and that
[1:09:22] book exact ly we know where it was when
[1:09:25] it was and he said arise go to Nineveh
[1:09:30] that great City and cry against it for
[1:09:32] their wickedness has come up before
[1:09:35] me in this period we've seen Elisha
[1:09:38] healing non and anointing hezel to be a
[1:09:42] king to brutalize and Slaughter many of
[1:09:44] the descendants of Jacob now we have
[1:09:47] Jonah going to start a Revival in
[1:09:52] Nineveh Nineveh is the capital of
[1:09:58] Assyria they repent and only 37 years
[1:10:02] later God uses them to
[1:10:04] destroy the Northern Kingdom of Israel
[1:10:08] to depopulate it and Scatter the
[1:10:10] Israelites and then repopulate it with
[1:10:12] people from other
[1:10:14] places no wonder Jonah was reluctant to
[1:10:17] go there and not only for their extreme
[1:10:21] cruelty and brutality to those they
[1:10:23] conquered the the background image here
[1:10:26] I know it's a little hard to see and
[1:10:27] that's intentional is from a photo that
[1:10:29] I took when Heather and I were at the
[1:10:31] British museum about a year and a half
[1:10:32] ago in in London it's a detail of a
[1:10:35] bronze hinge on an Assyrian gate dating
[1:10:38] back to about 850 BC about a hundred
[1:10:41] years or so before Jonah went to Nineveh
[1:10:42] so what these guys did in Assyria was
[1:10:45] certainly well known the Assyrians were
[1:10:47] brutally cruel people you can see hands
[1:10:49] and feet and heads you can see a guy
[1:10:51] that's been tortured and he's impaled on
[1:10:55] a
[1:10:55] pole these were not nice people you did
[1:10:59] not want them to be your enemies and if
[1:11:01] they were your friends you wanted them
[1:11:02] to live in the next
[1:11:04] town
[1:11:07] wickedness well this chart again just to
[1:11:11] give you a little brief idea there's
[1:11:13] only Kings of Judah now because Israel
[1:11:16] has gone off into
[1:11:18] captivity I've circled my favorite one
[1:11:21] there his his name is Josiah in fact
[1:11:24] Heather and I named our Second Son
[1:11:26] Josiah a after this guy you'll notice
[1:11:30] under written prophets that there's
[1:11:32] seven names there n Jeremiah zephani
[1:11:35] habak Daniel Ezekiel
[1:11:39] Joel these this shows you where they
[1:11:43] were relative to the various Kings in
[1:11:45] Judah in time you can see the like for
[1:11:48] example nahem Jeremiah and Zephaniah
[1:11:50] were all prophesying at exactly the same
[1:11:51] time they overlapped all three of them
[1:11:53] were on the scene
[1:11:55] simultaneously
[1:11:57] anyway one thing when you're reading
[1:11:59] some of these other books you can refer
[1:12:01] back and say wait this was this period
[1:12:04] they were in Judah what was going on in
[1:12:06] Judah at that time it gives you context
[1:12:09] so you can help get a better idea when
[1:12:10] you see a person that writes a
[1:12:12] particular thing well what's the context
[1:12:14] where was he why was he saying that
[1:12:15] particular thing well this gives you
[1:12:18] that
[1:12:19] information um and and you can see there
[1:12:23] I I excerpted this from a place called
[1:12:52] www.bible.com talk about the books of
[1:12:54] first and 2 Chronicles we can focus on
[1:12:57] some of these people and the events that
[1:12:59] they influenced tonight I want to focus
[1:13:03] for a bit on this fellow
[1:13:07] jeroboam we keep reading he did that
[1:13:10] which was evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:13:11] he departed not from the sins of
[1:13:13] jeroboam the son of nebat who made
[1:13:15] Israel to sin let let's examine this
[1:13:18] just a little
[1:13:20] bit what what's that somebody saying
[1:13:23] brother Lyall who was
[1:13:25] Jobo what was the sin thank you for
[1:13:28] asking we have to go back to First Kings
[1:13:31] for part of the answer we have been and
[1:13:34] we be reading a fair bit from First
[1:13:35] Kings this evening I realize this is a
[1:13:38] study of Second Kings but what happens
[1:13:40] in First Kings is planting the seed and
[1:13:44] nurturing it and it grows through second
[1:13:46] king until it comes to fruition so you
[1:13:49] can't really separate them this portion
[1:13:51] of First Kings occurs during the the
[1:13:53] reign of Solomon at at the start of the
[1:13:55] Rebellion near end of near the end of
[1:13:58] Solomon's life where he's starting to go
[1:14:00] the wrong
[1:14:01] way we read First Kings
[1:14:06] 11 jeroboam the son of nebat an
[1:14:09] ephrathite meaning that he was of the
[1:14:12] tribe of
[1:14:13] Ephraim of zaretta Solomon's servant
[1:14:17] whose mother's name was zarua a widow
[1:14:19] woman even he lifted up his hand against
[1:14:22] the king
[1:14:24] and this was the cause here's why he
[1:14:26] lifted up his hand against the king so
[1:14:28] we're going to get a little story here
[1:14:29] to tell you what was going on it says
[1:14:31] Solomon built Milo and repaired the
[1:14:33] breaches of the city of David his father
[1:14:36] now you built Milo you start looking on
[1:14:37] a map you're not going to find it what
[1:14:40] it means is he's rebuilding supporting
[1:14:42] Terraces and he's filling in the gaps in
[1:14:45] the wall so there's a construction crew
[1:14:46] that's going on fixing things up uh in
[1:14:49] the city of David which is at the edge
[1:14:51] of the city of
[1:14:52] Jerusalem and so we have this
[1:14:54] construction
[1:14:57] crew and it says the man jeroboam was a
[1:15:00] mighty man of Valor Solomon seeing the
[1:15:03] young man that he was industrious made
[1:15:05] him ruler over all the charge of the
[1:15:06] House of Joseph the house of Joseph
[1:15:09] that's ephriam and manasse so here's
[1:15:11] this fellow that he's basically
[1:15:13] promoting him in this construction crew
[1:15:15] and he says hey you be the foreman you
[1:15:16] take care of this I can see that you've
[1:15:18] got you've got some Talent here you've
[1:15:19] got some Zeal you can make this
[1:15:21] happen we're doing Renovations here you
[1:15:24] can uh you can do a good job for me
[1:15:26] Solomon's observing the young man
[1:15:28] promoting him from within smart smart
[1:15:30] business well it it came to pass at that
[1:15:34] time in other words one time while this
[1:15:35] work was going on when Jobo went out of
[1:15:38] Jerusalem that the prophet aijah the
[1:15:42] shilonite which simply means he's from
[1:15:44] Shiloh he found him in the way and he
[1:15:48] aijah had Cloud himself in in a new
[1:15:51] garment he had a new cloak or or or or a
[1:15:53] new
[1:15:54] robe and they too were alone in the
[1:15:56] field and aija caught the new garment
[1:15:59] that was on them and rent it in 12
[1:16:03] pieces I'm only going to do it
[1:16:07] once and he said to
[1:16:10] Jobo take 10
[1:16:15] pieces for thus sayith the Lord the god
[1:16:18] of Israel behold I will Rend the kingdom
[1:16:22] out of the hand of
[1:16:23] Solomon and will give 10 tribes to thee
[1:16:27] but he shall have one tribe for my
[1:16:29] servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's
[1:16:31] sake the city which I have chosen of all
[1:16:34] the tribes of Israel now I know each one
[1:16:37] of you has said wait
[1:16:39] 12 and one 12 minus 10 is two not
[1:16:45] one what's going on well here's what's
[1:16:48] going on Simeon got left out of the math
[1:16:52] you can see this is how the territories
[1:16:54] were divided under Joshua that Judah has
[1:16:57] his big green territory Simeon is an
[1:17:00] island within the Sea of Judah so you
[1:17:02] can't have Simeon be part of Israel up
[1:17:05] there you're going to have a thing like
[1:17:06] we have now between Gaza and the West
[1:17:08] Bank it just doesn't work so Simeon is
[1:17:11] absorbed into the kingdom of Judah but
[1:17:14] it's not mentioned by name but that's
[1:17:15] why there's 12 tribes even though only
[1:17:17] 11 are mentioned I know that you were
[1:17:20] curious and you go home tonight you
[1:17:21] wouldn't sleep until you knew that
[1:17:23] answer so I just had to share that with
[1:17:26] you
[1:17:27] because this fellow aijah the shilonite
[1:17:30] goes on he says
[1:17:33] because pay close attention jeroboam
[1:17:36] listen here's why I'm taking the
[1:17:39] majority of the kingdom and giving it to
[1:17:41] you are you listening
[1:17:43] jeroboam I the Lord am doing this
[1:17:46] because that they the people under
[1:17:48] Solomon's leadership have forsaken me
[1:17:52] have worshiped Ash tth the goddess of
[1:17:54] the zidonians Kus the god of the
[1:17:57] moabites milham the god of the children
[1:17:59] of Ammon and have not walked in my ways
[1:18:02] to do that which is right in mine eyes
[1:18:04] and to keep my statutes and my judgments
[1:18:08] as David Solomon's father did we'll skip
[1:18:12] down to verse 37 he says I will take
[1:18:15] thee and thou shalt Reign according to
[1:18:18] all that thy soul desireth and shall be
[1:18:21] king over Israel and it shall be are you
[1:18:24] listening jbone here's my condition I
[1:18:28] lay out plainly for you if thou wil
[1:18:31] hearken unto all that I command thee and
[1:18:33] Willl walk in my ways and do that which
[1:18:35] is right in my sight to keep my statutes
[1:18:39] and my Commandments as David my servant
[1:18:41] did that I will be with thee Jobo and
[1:18:46] build thee a sure house as I built for
[1:18:49] David and will give Israel unto thee
[1:18:55] I will for this afflict the seed of
[1:18:57] David but not
[1:19:00] forever well word of is gets back to the
[1:19:02] Palace Solomon therefore sought to kill
[1:19:06] jeroboam jeroboam arose and fled into
[1:19:10] Egypt unto shishak king of Egypt and was
[1:19:15] in Egypt until the death of
[1:19:21] Solomon
[1:19:23] we now know who jeroboam is jeroboam has
[1:19:27] his marching orders he'll be king over
[1:19:29] 10 of the 12 tribes of Israel God will
[1:19:31] secure his throne if he remains faithful
[1:19:33] to the Lord the one who is giving him
[1:19:36] this Authority he's a servant of Solomon
[1:19:39] he's not
[1:19:44] related after the kingdom is split we
[1:19:47] find out what the sin of jeroboam is the
[1:19:50] sin that caused the eventual destruction
[1:19:53] of the Kingdom the scattering of the
[1:19:54] people the seeds of destruction of both
[1:19:56] kingdoms Israel and Judah it's just as
[1:20:00] Paul tells us in Galatians be not
[1:20:03] deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a
[1:20:06] man SWS that shall he also reap he that
[1:20:10] sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
[1:20:13] corruption but he that sth to the spirit
[1:20:16] shall of the spirit reap life
[1:20:20] Everlasting the seed that was sown
[1:20:24] the sin of jeroboam First Kings
[1:20:26] 12:25 then jeroboam built shakam in
[1:20:29] Mount ephriam and dwelt therein and went
[1:20:32] out from fence and built penuel so he's
[1:20:34] got a construction program going on but
[1:20:37] Jobo said in his heart he he thought to
[1:20:40] himself now shall the kingdom return to
[1:20:44] the House of David maybe he didn't
[1:20:46] really believe what God had said if this
[1:20:49] people go up to do sacrifice in the
[1:20:51] house of the Lord of Jerusalem
[1:20:53] then shall the heart of this people turn
[1:20:55] again unto their lord even unto rabam
[1:20:57] king of Judah and they shall kill me and
[1:21:01] go again to
[1:21:02] reob King of
[1:21:05] Judah he's talking to himself he's
[1:21:07] listening to his imagination he's
[1:21:09] forgetting what he was told he's
[1:21:11] forgetting how he got
[1:21:13] there whereupon the king Jobo took
[1:21:17] counsel it's not only rabo that has bad
[1:21:20] counselors job's got some bad ones too
[1:21:23] and made two calves of gold
[1:21:27] oo and said unto the people it's too
[1:21:30] much for you to go up to Jerusalem
[1:21:33] Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought
[1:21:35] thee out of the land of
[1:21:39] Egypt golden
[1:21:41] calves golden
[1:21:45] calves we we'll get to maybe why those
[1:21:47] are golden calves in a moment so he said
[1:21:51] the one of these Cales as Idols in
[1:21:55] bethl bethl where Jacob thought God
[1:21:59] lived and the other he put in Dan so
[1:22:02] he's got one at the southern extreme of
[1:22:04] his kingdom and one at the northern
[1:22:06] extreme of his
[1:22:07] kingdom this thing became a sin for the
[1:22:11] people went to worship before the one
[1:22:13] and even unto
[1:22:14] Dan and he made a he jeroboam made a
[1:22:17] house of high places he set up shrines
[1:22:19] and temples on the peaks of the nearby
[1:22:21] Hills made priests of the lowest of the
[1:22:24] people which were not the sons of
[1:22:27] Levi it didn't stop there Jobo ordained
[1:22:31] a feast in the eighth month on the 15th
[1:22:33] day of the month like under the feast
[1:22:35] that is in Judah on the 15th day of the
[1:22:38] sth month the Feast of
[1:22:40] Tabernacles and he offered upon the
[1:22:42] altar so did he in
[1:22:44] bethl sacrificing under the Cales that
[1:22:47] he had made and he placed in bethl the
[1:22:51] priests of the high place Jes which he
[1:22:53] had made so he offered upon the altar
[1:22:56] which he' made in
[1:22:58] bethl the 15th day the eth month even in
[1:23:01] the month which he devised in his own
[1:23:02] heart his own imagination he made it up
[1:23:05] not only did he make up the guides he
[1:23:07] made up the feasts he made up the
[1:23:08] celebrations he invented the whole thing
[1:23:11] ordained a feast unto the children of
[1:23:12] Israel and he offered upon the Altar and
[1:23:14] burnt
[1:23:15] incense jeroboam after seeing the
[1:23:18] Fulfillment of the prophecy and
[1:23:20] obtaining a kingdom of precisely 10
[1:23:22] tribes not nine not
[1:23:24] eight did exactly what he was told not
[1:23:29] to do and why golden calves
[1:23:32] again well where did he go when he was
[1:23:35] running from
[1:23:36] Solomon Egypt he was there for a number
[1:23:39] of years we saw in an exodus at the foot
[1:23:43] of the mountain where they worshiped a
[1:23:44] golden calf and you probably recall from
[1:23:47] the study that we did on Exodus that
[1:23:49] that hatur is one of their principal
[1:23:51] gods that they worship this goddess of
[1:23:54] lots of
[1:23:55] stuff is often represented as a cow so
[1:23:59] we've
[1:24:01] got complete circle going back again a
[1:24:04] guy goes to Egypt comes back with
[1:24:07] polluted ideas about religion and
[1:24:09] establishes his own thing and Embraces
[1:24:13] hotor what's the first of the 10
[1:24:16] commandments Exodus 20 thou shalt have
[1:24:18] no other gods before me Thou shalt not
[1:24:21] make unto thee any Graven image or any
[1:24:23] likeness of anything in Heaven above or
[1:24:25] the Earth beneath or in the water under
[1:24:27] the Earth Thou shalt not bow thyself to
[1:24:30] them nor serve
[1:24:33] them and in
[1:24:35] Leviticus we read of a particular
[1:24:38] practice that the Lord hated Leviticus
[1:24:41] 18 Thou shalt not let any of thy seed
[1:24:44] thy children pass through the fire to
[1:24:47] mooch neither shalt thou profane the
[1:24:50] name of the Lord thy God I am the
[1:24:55] Lord another warning in Deuteronomy
[1:24:57] where the people are warned not to
[1:24:58] worship as a Canaanites worshiped Thou
[1:25:00] shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God
[1:25:03] for every Abomination have they done
[1:25:05] unto their
[1:25:08] gods every Abomination to the Lord which
[1:25:10] he hateth have they done unto their gods
[1:25:13] even their sons and their daughters have
[1:25:15] they burnt and the fire to their gods
[1:25:20] pass through the fire
[1:25:23] we see then that jeroboam sin which the
[1:25:25] people followed and even the kings of
[1:25:27] Judah rated as good did not completely
[1:25:30] stop was idolatry including sacrificing
[1:25:35] their children this idol worship was
[1:25:38] centered at
[1:25:40] betel let's return to Second Kings I
[1:25:43] think the 17th chapter of Second Kings
[1:25:46] is a key to understanding what happened
[1:25:49] to Israel later to Judah and it's a
[1:25:51] flashing red light right warning Us in
[1:25:54] this place here and now we'll pick up
[1:25:57] the text he just described the sin of
[1:26:03] Israel the writer tells us yet the Lord
[1:26:06] testified against he warned Israel and
[1:26:08] against he warned Judah by all the
[1:26:11] prophets and by all the seers saying
[1:26:13] Turn ye from your evil ways keep my
[1:26:16] Commandments and my statutes according
[1:26:18] to all the laws I commanded your fathers
[1:26:21] which I have sent to you by my servants
[1:26:23] the
[1:26:24] prophets
[1:26:26] notwithstanding they would not hear but
[1:26:29] hardened their necks like to the neck of
[1:26:31] their
[1:26:32] fathers and what's about their fathers
[1:26:35] that did not believe in the Lord their
[1:26:38] God they didn't do what he said because
[1:26:41] they didn't believe in him they ignored
[1:26:44] the command I I just choke over
[1:26:48] this they rejected his statutes his
[1:26:51] Covenant that he made with their fathers
[1:26:52] his testimonies his warnings which he
[1:26:55] testified against them and they followed
[1:26:57] vanity and that word means false gods
[1:27:00] emptiness falsehood and became vain
[1:27:04] became empty and they went after they
[1:27:07] followed the examples of the Heathen
[1:27:09] that were round about them concerning
[1:27:11] whom the Lord had charged them that they
[1:27:12] should not do like them they should not
[1:27:14] emulate those
[1:27:16] practices and they left they abandoned
[1:27:19] all the Commandments of the Lord their
[1:27:21] God
[1:27:22] and made them molted images even two
[1:27:24] calves and made a Grove and worshiped
[1:27:26] all the host of heaven and served ba all
[1:27:30] and they caused their sons and their
[1:27:33] daughters to pass through the
[1:27:37] fire this suggests at least some forms
[1:27:40] of human
[1:27:41] sacrifice not clearly stated but often
[1:27:44] strongly implied in the scriptures
[1:27:45] specifically called out as we read in
[1:27:47] Deuteronomy many translations of this
[1:27:50] verse say they sacrificed their sons and
[1:27:52] their daughters in the
[1:27:54] fire and used divination and
[1:27:57] enchantments and sold they gave
[1:27:59] themselves to do evil in the sight of
[1:28:01] the Lord to provoke him to
[1:28:03] anger therefore the Lord was very angry
[1:28:07] with Israel and removed them out of his
[1:28:09] sight out of his presence there was none
[1:28:13] left but the tribe of Judah only this is
[1:28:16] referring to that conquest by Assyria
[1:28:19] whose capital city was Nineveh to whom
[1:28:21] Jonah had been only 37 years
[1:28:24] earlier but it doesn't stop
[1:28:27] there also Judah kept not the
[1:28:30] Commandments of the Lord their God but
[1:28:32] walked in the statutes of Israel which
[1:28:35] they made and the Lord rejected
[1:28:38] 10% oh the Lord rejected
[1:28:42] half no the Lord came to despise all the
[1:28:46] seed all the descendants of Israel and
[1:28:49] Afflicted them and delivered them into
[1:28:51] the hand of of spoilers until he had
[1:28:53] cast them out of his sight cast them
[1:28:55] from his
[1:28:59] presence for he
[1:29:01] rent he tore he violently removed Israel
[1:29:05] from the House of David and they made
[1:29:08] jeroboam the son of nebat King and
[1:29:10] jeroboam drave Israel from following the
[1:29:13] Lord and made them sin a great sin for
[1:29:17] the children of Israel walked in all the
[1:29:20] sins of jeroboam which he did that he
[1:29:22] parted not from them until the Lord
[1:29:25] removed Israel out of his sight as he
[1:29:28] had said repeatedly warned that he would
[1:29:30] do by all his servants the prophets so
[1:29:33] was Israel carried away out of their own
[1:29:35] land to Assyria unto this day when we
[1:29:39] refer sometimes to the 10 lost tribes
[1:29:41] who referring to this captivity of Syria
[1:29:44] where they were depopulated and
[1:29:46] resettled
[1:29:48] elsewhere that's why Israel was
[1:29:50] destroyed
[1:29:52] what happened
[1:29:54] next is a solemn warning to
[1:29:57] me I think it's a solemn warning to
[1:30:02] us the king of Assyria brought men from
[1:30:06] Babylon from cah from Ava from Hamad
[1:30:09] from Safar rim and place him in the
[1:30:12] cities of Samaria instead of to replace
[1:30:15] the children of Israel and they
[1:30:17] possessed Samaria and dwelt in the
[1:30:20] cities thereof sometimes we think in
[1:30:22] terms of dispensation Jewish
[1:30:25] dispensation we're part of the Gentile
[1:30:28] dispensation this looks a bit like
[1:30:30] something that's showing a gentile
[1:30:34] dispensation and it was so at the
[1:30:37] beginning of their dwelling there that
[1:30:40] they feared and this term actually means
[1:30:42] worshiped they worshiped not the Lord
[1:30:44] therefore the Lord sent lines among them
[1:30:46] which killed some of them wherefore they
[1:30:49] they spake to the king of Assyria saying
[1:30:52] the Nations which thou Hast removed and
[1:30:54] placed in the cities of Samaria the
[1:30:57] people of the you've resettled us here
[1:30:59] but we don't know the manner of the god
[1:31:01] of the land therefore he sent Lions
[1:31:04] among them and and behold they're
[1:31:05] they're killing some of us because we
[1:31:07] don't know the manner of the god of the
[1:31:09] land we don't know the rules for
[1:31:10] worshiping the local deity there those
[1:31:13] days everybody had God in a box would
[1:31:16] don't put God in a box they had God in a
[1:31:18] box so if you're in this town you
[1:31:19] worship that God keep him happy and
[1:31:22] you'll get rain and you won't get too
[1:31:24] much lightning and and you over here you
[1:31:26] worship that God and the volcano won't
[1:31:27] erupt and but if you if you're over here
[1:31:30] and you worship that God the volcano
[1:31:31] might get you so you got to deal with
[1:31:34] this local deity you've got to have the
[1:31:36] the right
[1:31:38] box so what happens the king of Assyria
[1:31:42] commanded saying carry thither one of
[1:31:45] the priests whom you brought from then
[1:31:48] and and let them go and dwell there and
[1:31:51] teach them them the manner the the rules
[1:31:53] of worship of the god of the
[1:31:56] land send them there to teach him about
[1:31:58] the Lord then one of the priests whom
[1:32:01] they had carried away from Samaria came
[1:32:04] and dwelt in bethl and taught them how
[1:32:09] they should fear how they should Worship
[1:32:11] the Lord worship and rever how be it
[1:32:16] every nation made gods of their own and
[1:32:19] put them in the houses of the high
[1:32:20] places the shrine on the Hills which the
[1:32:23] Samaritans the the people of Samaria in
[1:32:25] this case Israel not Samaritans as we
[1:32:27] think of had made every nation in their
[1:32:30] cities wherein they dwelt the men of
[1:32:33] Babylon made sakena the men of cth made
[1:32:35] nargal the men of hamat made Ashima it's
[1:32:38] a list of the various gods and Idols
[1:32:40] that uh that represented them and the
[1:32:42] aites mayis and tarac and the Safar ofit
[1:32:46] burnt their children in fire to adamik
[1:32:49] and Adamec the gods of the safaran
[1:32:53] so they worshiped the Lord they they
[1:32:54] worshiped the Lord and at the same time
[1:32:57] made Ender themselves of the lowest of
[1:32:59] them Priests of the high places which
[1:33:01] sacrific for them in the houses of the
[1:33:03] high
[1:33:04] places says they feared the Lord again
[1:33:06] meaning they Worship the Lord okay this
[1:33:08] guy told us we do this do the sacrifice
[1:33:10] whatever that's good and at the same
[1:33:13] time they served their own Gods after
[1:33:15] the manner of the Nations whom They
[1:33:17] Carried Away from then after their
[1:33:19] Customs until this day they do after
[1:33:22] their former manners they persist in
[1:33:24] their former practices they they fear
[1:33:26] not they don't truly or exclusively
[1:33:28] Worship the Lord neither do they after
[1:33:31] their statutes or after their ordinances
[1:33:33] or after the law and commandment which
[1:33:35] the Lord commanded the children of Jacob
[1:33:37] whom he named
[1:33:38] Israel skip a few verses down to 38 the
[1:33:41] Lord is rehearsing the things that he
[1:33:43] has commanded Israel and the Covenant
[1:33:46] that I have made with you you shall not
[1:33:47] forget neither shall you fear other gods
[1:33:51] worship other gods but the Lord your God
[1:33:54] shall ye fear and he shall deliver you
[1:33:56] out of the hand of all your
[1:33:58] enemies how be it they did not hearken
[1:34:02] but they did after their former manner
[1:34:04] they ignored the warning so these
[1:34:06] nations feared mixed worship of the Lord
[1:34:10] and served their graven images both
[1:34:13] their children and their children's
[1:34:15] children as did their fathers so do they
[1:34:18] ender this
[1:34:20] day notice that the new residents of the
[1:34:24] lands that had been Israel's were taught
[1:34:26] in the ways of the Lord they then had
[1:34:29] adapted and they adopted that worship as
[1:34:32] being to just a local God so they
[1:34:35] acknowledged that God while continuing
[1:34:37] and worshiping their own personal Gods
[1:34:41] if the musicians would come at this time
[1:34:44] reminds me a little bit of uh Rachel
[1:34:46] stealing her father's Idols clinging to
[1:34:48] the old even as she seemed to adopt
[1:34:50] Jacob's God
[1:34:52] what about us what about
[1:34:55] me is the Lord just one of the Gods in
[1:34:59] my
[1:35:00] life where do I spend my
[1:35:03] time where do I spend my
[1:35:06] energy what practices consume my
[1:35:10] life where are my
[1:35:13] thoughts to acknowledge Jesus is good
[1:35:16] it's
[1:35:17] necessary but it's not
[1:35:19] enough we must re recognize truly
[1:35:23] recognize our
[1:35:25] failure and
[1:35:28] inadequacy my sin the word means to miss
[1:35:32] the mark think of an Archer shooting an
[1:35:34] arrow maybe he hits the target but he
[1:35:36] misses the bull's eye that's literally
[1:35:38] what sin means is to miss the
[1:35:41] Mark I must acknowledge my
[1:35:45] sin I must truly
[1:35:48] repent in fact the Book of Revelation
[1:35:51] says in our age we should be zealous to
[1:35:54] repent that's not part of our modern
[1:35:56] culture of pluralism and inclusion and
[1:36:00] diversity we must be careful to not fall
[1:36:03] into the Trap of the Gentiles sent to
[1:36:06] Israel to replace Jacob's descendants by
[1:36:08] the king of Assyria to acknowledge the
[1:36:11] Lord but not to serve him
[1:36:16] singularly and wholeheartedly Heather if
[1:36:19] you'd come to not fall into the sin of
[1:36:23] jeroboam to not sacrifice our children
[1:36:25] not to the fire of intentional
[1:36:28] sacrifice but through failing to teach
[1:36:31] them failing to raise them to know the
[1:36:35] Lord that sacrificing your children to
[1:36:39] live the life before them not just to
[1:36:42] know about him that's just religion but
[1:36:45] to have
[1:36:46] relationship with
[1:36:49] him Heather is joining me to oh you've
[1:36:53] got the mic Heather's joining me to sing
[1:36:54] a song as we pass the service to our
[1:36:57] pastor it's a song about an event in
[1:37:00] Second
[1:37:01] Kings and about what we must
[1:37:13] do wasen with a rather dread disease so
[1:37:19] he sent for the man of of God to
[1:37:24] pray but Elisha said to non go dip
[1:37:28] yourself in Jordan and let the Cool
[1:37:32] Waters wash those spots
[1:37:35] away so non went down to the river of
[1:37:38] Jordan he waited right in the Rushing
[1:37:41] Water he dipped himself he dipped
[1:37:44] himself in the river of
[1:37:47] Jordan and the Cool Waters made him
[1:37:53] whole to the river of Jordan Our Savior
[1:37:59] went one day and the preacher John the
[1:38:03] Baptist met him
[1:38:06] there and when John baptized Jesus in
[1:38:10] the Jordan Rushing Waters the mighty
[1:38:14] power of God filled the
[1:38:18] air I'm going down river Jord going to
[1:38:22] wait right in the Rushing Water I'm
[1:38:25] going down going down to the river of
[1:38:30] Jordan and let the Cool Waters cleans my
[1:38:36] soul now the river of Jordan is many
[1:38:42] miles away and that Mighty River I might
[1:38:46] never
[1:38:48] see but I'll find an altar and with an
[1:38:53] oldfashioned prayer my river of Jordan
[1:38:58] that will
[1:39:00] be I'm on my way the river oford going
[1:39:04] to wait right in the rushing I'm going
[1:39:08] down I'm going down to the river of
[1:39:12] Jordan and let the Cool Waters cleans my
[1:39:19] soul I'm going down
[1:39:21] down going to wait right
[1:39:24] in I'm going down to the river of
[1:39:29] Jorden and let those Cool Waters cleanse
[1:39:34] my
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:42] soul you know brother Li I was talking I
[1:39:44] was thinking he was he was talking about
[1:39:47] how each person they had a God here for
[1:39:50] this and a God here for that and and
[1:39:53] have you ever been to a Catholic
[1:39:56] bookstore it's exactly like that you can
[1:40:00] buy a little saint and and if you're
[1:40:03] trying to sell your house you bury him
[1:40:05] in the front
[1:40:06] yard and then it'll help you sell your
[1:40:08] house and then you have the patron
[1:40:10] saints you know traveled through Latin
[1:40:12] America you have the patron saint up in
[1:40:15] the in in some sort of a shrine for this
[1:40:18] little village and it might be Francis
[1:40:20] or it might be Peter it might be one of
[1:40:22] one of the different ones it's exactly
[1:40:25] what brother Lyall was talking about
[1:40:27] that wow it's so easy for
[1:40:30] idolatry to slip in just right into our
[1:40:35] lives so what we're going to do is
[1:40:38] brother Lyall and I were talking before
[1:40:41] service tonight and uh we thought it'd
[1:40:44] be a good idea to devote one of our
[1:40:47] services to questions and answers on on
[1:40:51] uh the the different books in the Bibles
[1:40:53] that we've already gone through now
[1:40:55] first and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles
[1:41:00] give they give a nice um a nice summary
[1:41:04] of a period of time I think I couldn't
[1:41:06] see your chart very good but I think
[1:41:08] Second Kings was about 300 years
[1:41:10] something like
[1:41:11] that yeah somewhere like that when we
[1:41:14] started um as brother Lyall said we
[1:41:17] started with with um the uh the death of
[1:41:21] Solomon there and and we go all the way
[1:41:24] through the end and we throw some
[1:41:26] prophets in there so right in the middle
[1:41:28] of the book we see the destruction of
[1:41:30] the North Country which was Israel he
[1:41:33] talked about Jonah going and uh being
[1:41:36] sent to neva which was in Assyria and
[1:41:39] then they come down and they destroy
[1:41:42] this country of Israel and disperse it
[1:41:45] and I think took a lot of them captive I
[1:41:47] think and then it goes on a little while
[1:41:51] longer and we see the same thing we see
[1:41:53] these Kings rise up we see I think
[1:41:55] around in chapter 18 we see Isaiah rise
[1:41:59] up and he starts prophesying and that's
[1:42:01] right around the book of Isaiah time
[1:42:03] goes on and then right at the end of the
[1:42:07] book of Second Kings there we see this
[1:42:11] guy come in named
[1:42:15] Nebuchadnezzar and he comes in and he
[1:42:19] destroys the remnant of what was left we
[1:42:23] had Judah in the South as as brother
[1:42:26] Lyle said Syria was they they destroyed
[1:42:29] that country in the north and
[1:42:31] repopulated it and took captive and then
[1:42:35] towards the end same thing happens just
[1:42:38] a few Kings later in Judah and we see
[1:42:42] Nebuchadnezzar we see the rise of him
[1:42:44] towards the end and it's so neat to me
[1:42:47] as you pointed out how all this during
[1:42:49] the Kings it's just chronological order
[1:42:52] and then we see these prophets come in
[1:42:55] we see Elijah come in we see Elisha come
[1:42:57] in we see Jona we see Isaiah we see
[1:43:00] these prophets they prophesy against the
[1:43:04] sin and against the Kings and and when
[1:43:07] like brother Lyall did when you can tie
[1:43:09] the two in it's just beautiful just
[1:43:12] great so start thinking about the
[1:43:15] questions that you might have let's go
[1:43:16] from Genesis to 2
[1:43:19] Chronicles and and uh get get those
[1:43:21] questions together and then brother
[1:43:23] Lyall and I will devote a service to
[1:43:25] answering factual questions not
[1:43:28] doctrinal questions factual questions
[1:43:31] factual questions about from Genesis to
[1:43:34] 2 Chronicles sound good all right let's
[1:43:37] all
[1:43:39] stand
[1:43:41] brother will
[1:43:45] serve because I love the

[1:51:47] L brother ly told the story
[1:51:50] about Elijah and
[1:51:52] Elisha and those words as brother Aaron
[1:51:55] was singing
[1:51:56] that that Elijah must have looked over
[1:52:00] when he came to that Jordan
[1:52:02] River and he smoted the
[1:52:05] river with his mantle and
[1:52:08] it parted and he and he went
[1:52:12] across and then he took his Heavenly
[1:52:16] flight the Chariots of Israel the the
[1:52:20] the horses came down took him up and
[1:52:24] brought him away I've never thought that
[1:52:28] that song would represent that but after
[1:52:31] hearing brother Lyall tonight and
[1:52:33] telling that story it most certainly
[1:52:35] does and it most certainly types what I
[1:52:38] believe that we are going to see very
[1:52:40] soon that we will we can look across
[1:52:43] that River but
