right here God bless you my friend what's your name Louis welcome how old are you Louis today is today your birthday [Applause] praise the Lord good boy I didn't embarrass you right happy birthday my friend it's good to spend your birthday in church I hope that that it doesn't seem I'm going to be teaching on this book right here I hope it doesn't seem like school this book this book's a lot deeper than anything that you're going to learn in school it's a good book we're teaching on the book of Acts tonight book of Acts was written by a famous man named Luke Luke was a doctor he was a he was with a doctor or a physician we call him and he was a good friend of the Apostle Paul who was the main character now in the book of Acts Luke basically wrote down he interviewed a lot of people and he did his research and he wrote a lot of this stuff down that that came from his gospel that he wrote about Jesus and then he got to travel and got to be friends with this man the Apostle Paul that I'm going to be talking about tonight and this what we're going to hear tonight is the Apostle Paul it's his first recorded sermon and I know it's been a blessing to me as I've been reading it and learning it and now I hope that I can take a little bit of blessings that I've got and then I could bring him to you let's start right let's get right into it the book of Acts chapter 13 we'll start with verse 15. we we did 1 through 14. on Wednesday so we'll get right into it acts chapter 13 verse 15. and after the reading of the law and of the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying amen and Brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on so so the setting here is is the the brothers are in church and they they read the the Bible and then they saw that they have some visitors among them and they which Brothers I didn't recognize you Brothers either I saw you come in what what are your names God bless you brother brother Pierre brother Elias where are you from oh there you go what's your name brother Warren God bless you where are you from Phoenix Phoenix all of you for the pier I think I've met you before have I met you before God God bless you all welcome welcome to the Tabernacle tonight we've been in a series on the book of Acts so let's uh so so what happened is like they would have get a guest Minister and they would they would say okay brother do you have anything that you would like to say to the people so they called up Paul here and Paul stood up and beckoning them with his hand he said men of Israel and ye that fear God give audience the God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt and with a high arm brought he out of brought he them out of it and about the time of 40 years suffered he Their Manners in the wilderness now he's talking about when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and they wandered in the desert for 40 years we all know the story right do you know you know what the children of Israel are right the children of Israel I'll give a little explanation you have Abraham Isaac and Jacob so Abraham was kind of the father of the faith he came God spoke to him and brought him out of the land and separated him and made him a promise that that his his descendants would be like the stars of the sky and he made a promise of a Promised Land so Abraham his son Isaac and then his son was named Jacob now Jacob had 12 sons and those we call the Patriarchs those are the 12 tribes of Israel now what happened was Jacob he wrestled with the Lord one night all night long and he he wanted the Lord to give him a blessing and towards the breaking of the day he was sometimes we say wrestle with the Lord he wrestled with an angel towards the breaking of the day this Angel tells me says let me go because the sun's coming up and Jacob said I'm not going to let you go until you bless me so then this Angel says okay I'm going to change your name from Jacob to Israel so that is where we have the sons the children of Israel they're the children of Jacob they're the 12 tribes just a little explanation for some that might not know that and when he had destroyed Seven Nations in the land of Canaan he divided their land to them by lot and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of 450 years until Samuel the prophet and afterwards they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years so there we have the very first king of Israel Saul so Saul was King for 40 years do you know how long David was King for 40 years and then how long was Solomon came for 40 years so he says here that that Saul was King for 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave their testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will now remember Paul's preaching this and of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus now what happened is Paul started here in the Book of Revelation when he was taught on Book of Genesis when he was talking about the children of is talking about Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's starting out way out there in Genesis and he brings it through David and it's very fitting because David we see that Jesus is called the son of David which means that his lineage was traced back to David as was prophesied from the tribe of Judah and Paul here he's showing us how important it is as he's preaching he's preaching to these these ministers really in this synagogue and he's showing how important it is for us to know our Bible so Paul here he's just quoted off the top of his head and he's he's giving this sermon and he's he's taking this all the way back and he's going through Saul and then through David and he's coming to modern day and it shows how important it is that we know our Bible there's doc there's many doctrines in the Bible that they're important to a Bible scholar now you see that many times in the book of Acts you see that that they do a miracle like um earlier that they smote this man blind and people and the governor saw that they blinded this sorcerer that Paul blinded the sorcerer so he said oh this must be true because there was a miracle done right here so God must be God must be with him so Paul showed a miracle and then Paul here now is exhorting on the scriptures so some people come through understanding the word other people come through the supernatural God gives us always a different way to come to the Lord I was um along these lines when I was in Jeffersonville when I was in the ministry there someone called and he had gotten a track on what was called The Serpent's Seed we all know what the Serpent's Seed is and he uh he read it and um there's a phone number on the back so he called the call came to me and he said my name is so and so I can't remember his name he was a professor at one of the um one of the seminaries that was in Mobile Alabama and he was he was sitting there eating in a barbecue restaurant and he had the little symbol of a seminary on his shirt so this brother comes up to him and he gives him a track and he says Hey read this so the guy being of course very intelligent he he reads it and it's on the serpent seed so he calls up and he says yeah he says so I read this and he says it I don't see how it jives with the word and um he said he said so are you saying that when Eve said I have gotten a man from the Lord he said are you saying um that uh that that was the serpent and I said when Cain was born I said no not at all and sometimes you know when if you are studied up and you're ready the Lord just gives you the right thing to say so I said no I said well I said are you saying that Adam was the Lord and he said ah no I said because if this man came from from the Lord then he was an Immaculate Conception that and and I'm saying that the serpent was his father you're saying that Adam was his father I said that doesn't apply to either one if you're saying it came from the Lord that would be like Jesus he said oh no he said he says no I'm not saying that and he he uh said a couple other scriptures and and I just liked the guy because he was he was legitimately wanting this conversation so I said you know what I said let's turn to Genesis chapter three why don't we do it right now and I said let's just read it and sometimes the word itself just reading it will answer a question so Genesis chapter 3 let's start with verse 14. so this is after the fall they had eaten The Forbidden fruits and they were they came before the Lord the Lord said why are you wearing fig leaves who told you you were naked they understood why they had to cover up now after they had done that act and now they were standing before the Lord they were embarrassed because they were they looked the same as they did the day before but now they understood a little bit more than they should have understood so they came before the Lord now listen to this and this is what I read to this Seminary guy and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all the cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and the and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life no controversy there and I will put enmity which is hatred separation fighting between me and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and I said brother we know what that is we know what a seed is and he says yeah he says I see where you're going with that and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and I asked him I said what is that talking about he said he's talking about the Christ I said let's keep going and unto the woman he said God's speaking now to Eve I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception I said what does that mean he had a he had an I assume he had it on his phone he was on the other Lonnie looked at it he said it means childbirth he said every other translation says says childbirth I said right so he's saying I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception I said he's telling her you're pregnant and he said wow I never looked at it like that and thou shalt bring forth children I said two Cain and Abel and he says huh and I desire to be shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over Thee I said brother this is all about childbirth and conception and all of that he says wow he says I never thought of it like that and he says um I need some more information on that so I don't know whatever happened to him but I I sent him everything that I could and uh we had a really nice conversation after that he asked me a lot of questions and we just seem to be on the same page but he needed the intellectual understanding and someone else like this Governor that we we hear about earlier in the book of Acts chapter 13. he needed the miracle so let's go back to the book of Acts 13 24. when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel I'm sorry when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel and as John fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that I am I am not he but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose now Paul puts in this John the Baptist in this explanation of who this Jesus Christ is very very important here because this is only about 10 years after the resurrection so so Paul is saying he's saying well this John the Baptist came and he was introducing this man that he said he's not worthy to untie his shoes now in historical records we see that there were followers of John the Baptist for not just decades after John left and after Jesus rose and not just centuries but thousands of years there are today followers of John the Baptist they're called the the sabians or the the mandians they're in Iraq and in Iran and they follow they still follow the teaching of this man John the Baptist yet they cannot accept Jesus Christ as the virgin-born son of God yet follow John's teaching how strange is that when the whole reason that God placed him on Earth was to preach the gospel was to introduce Christ the greatest man that had ever lived and I've said this before in my opinion the reason he was the greatest man that had ever lived is because he had the first Converse to Christ and we see here that the people ignored much of what John the Baptist was preaching about Christ and they just followed him and it's carried on to this day so Paul says here in verse 26 men and brethren Children of the stock of Abraham and whosoever among you feareth God to you is the word of this salvation scent so right here Paul is giving a little hint to say that we can go outside of our Jewish faith here and when he says here he says and whosoever among you and the stock of Abraham and whosoever among you that feareth God everyone is included and he's throwing out a little hint for they that dwell at Jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him so again Paul is striking these so-called Believers of his day and he's saying he's saying that that you read these scriptures in church you're reading all of these and you think that you're on the right side of History because you're preaching the prophet's message and you're actually the ones that crucified the one that all the prophets were talking about they may associate themselves with a certain Prophet or servant of the Lord but Paul is saying that you are fulfilling the evil that that same Prophet that you claim to believe prophesied would come very strange I mean it whoever that Prophet may be Moses said I'll raise up a prophet like unto me speaking of Christ Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive he said unto us a child is born unto us the son is given he prophesied these things and they're claiming to believe Isaiah and yet they're the ones that killed the one that he was talking about verse number 28. and although they found no cause of death in him yet desired they pilot that he should be slain he's telling them a story of of what happened this 10 years ago and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a Sepulcher but God raised him from the dead thank God and here we have the very Foundation of Christianity right here Paul is saying that that yes he died he was given as a sacrifice yet God raised him up from the dead and you know Jesus could not have given us eternal life he couldn't have promised us a resurrection if he couldn't raise from the dead himself and we see and he was seen many days of them which came up came up with him From Galilee to Jerusalem who are his Witnesses unto the people so he's talking about here the disciples he's talking about Peter and James and John and Mary and all these different ones that saw him after he had risen from the dead they saw him dead on the cross they saw him go into the grave and then they saw him as resurrected body they saw him as a resurrected man Jesus Christ and it wasn't just one or two that could have been faked it was many many disciples and Paul is referring back to these ones remember as I said it's only about 10 years after the resurrection and we declare unto you good glad tidings how that the promise which was made under the fathers God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up Jesus again as it is also written in the second Psalm Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee now he's saying that these prophets are your fathers he's saying that that you're the children of these these Prophets and God fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he raised up Jesus again as it is written in the second Psalm Thou Art my son this day have I begotten they begotten thee so he's quoting Assam he's quoting the Old Testament and and right here I want to stop now I'm fairly certain Paul didn't mean this as as he was preaching and he talks about the fathers the the children and the fathers but let me take let me take this opportunity we're teaching it's a Bible study so I I can I can take a left turn I'll take a right turn here in a minute and get back but let me take a left turn and let's go to Malachi chapter four speaking of children and fathers I want to explain a little bit right here Malachi chapter 4 verse 4. it says this now remember this is the Old Testament it's about 400 or so years before John the Baptist came remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers unless they come and smite the Earth with a curse very familiar scripture to us we all understand that but many times we hear people and they make the mistake of saying Malachi 3 is John the Baptist Malachi 4 is the prophet in our day William Branham that's not entirely true Malachi 4 applies to John the Baptist very much so do you believe me because I'm going to prove it very much so so we look we we see that that Paul here in his epistle or in the book of Acts in his sermon he's saying listen he said he's saying that that your hearts that the hearts of the fathers are are they our hearts need to be turned to them all of the fathers the prophetic fathers have preached this Christ so we need to understand what they're preaching about and this man John the Baptist now this is now this is not in Paul's sermon this man John the Baptist came to introduce this Jesus and turn the heart of the father's to the children where do I get that Luke chapter 1 verse 11. this is right at beginning of uh of the New Testament and there appeared unto him speaking of Zacharias which is John the Baptist dad and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when Zechariah saw him he was troubled troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee his son and shall call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth this is the Angel speaking for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink remember he's speaking of John the Baptist and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elias remember Elias is just the Greek form of the word Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children in the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord wow he said half of John the Baptist there's two part or half of Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to the fathers why did he only mention one because that was going to be fulfilled before the second coming let me read so let me let me read a quote to you here something brother Branham said in the the um in exposition of this seven Church ages he says this there's absolutely no doubt that Elijah must return before the coming of Jesus he has a specific work to accomplish that work is the part of Malachi 4 6 that says he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers to their fathers the reason we know this is his specific work to do at that time is because he already accomplished the part that says he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children when Allah when the Elijah Ministry was here in John the Baptist Luke 1 17 which which I just read so we know hear that this is a two-fold purpose in this Malachi chapter 4. so let's get back as an aside now I'll take my right turn sister Shirley I'll get back on track with the sermon that Paul is preaching in the in the book of Acts chapter 13. verse number 34. and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead of course speaking of Jesus now no more to return to corruption he saith on this wise I will give you the sure mercies of David verse number 35 says this wherefore he saith also in another Psalm Thou shalt not suffer thy only one to see corruption again I love the way Paul is prepared for to preach at any time he quotes the second psalm and then he says in another Psalm and I wonder if he just I can't remember which Psalm that is but I know it's there so Paul here he quotes the second and then he quotes another another Psalm and he's quoting psalm 16. and then Psalm 16 says this therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices for my flesh also shall Rest In Hope for that will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thy suffer thou neither without suffer thine Holy One to see corruption so he's saying here the body of the Messiah won't Decay until he's raised from the dead thou Wilt show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand and there are Pleasures forevermore now Paul he was saying this because the tomb of David was right there and David's body obviously died he corrupted and this this Psalm just did not apply to David so here is Paul and he's pulling this out of the Old Testament remember they're Scholars there and he's saying here is where that applies this very day for David after he had served his own Generation by the will of God fell on sleep and was laid unto his father's and saw corruption what I just said so David died he didn't fulfill that scripture he did not rise again but he whom God raised again saw no corruption oh now he's saying there was someone that did fulfill this song be it known unto you therefore men and Brethren that through this man is preached unto you the Forgiveness of sins and by him all that believe are Justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses what he just said was a mouthful so remember who Paul is speaking to he's speaking to a bunch of Jews there's some Gentiles there too which I'm going to get to in a minute but what he's saying is he's saying that this law of Moses he says you couldn't be justified you couldn't be saved by that now he's talking to people that are saying well they've been raised for literally 1500 years saying that that's the way that they will receive salvation is by living this law of Moses imagine that 1500 years brother Ronnie of tradition 1500 years and here Paul is this little little guy he comes up there and he says oh by the way now you're wrong that's not how you receive salvation by the uh by the law so his priest probably swallowed their sermon about that moment I guarantee they didn't like that now Paul is saying let me read that one again and by him all that belief are Justified from All Things by Christ you're Justified of all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses so Paul is saying that you can be justified by Christ you can be justified by Moses which turned everything upside down and he's saying here he's saying that the law is good because it shows you what sin is but the law cannot deliver you from those sins that is key that's key to the whole thing Paul is saying here that that yeah this law of Moses that you think you have salvation in you think you could there's an afterlife you think that you can have these things oh you can't that's just showing you what sin is it's just showing you how bad you are it's showing you what not to do but there is a way out and it's from this man that was here just 10 years ago now the next verse here is calling for repentance beware therefore lest that you that come upon you which was spoken of of the prophets behold you despisers now he's quoting here a prophet beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets when he says in the prophets it's meaning these these these shorter books in here of of the prophets and and uh Isaiah and and the different ones and he's quoting this he says be careful or this is going to represent you behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for I work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you any idea where he's talking from one of the most popular books in the Bible can you guess anybody happy cook he's quoting from habakkirk have a cook one five is where he's quoting from so what happened in habakkuk chapter 1 is the prophet was crying out to God about the sin that was in Israel and God responds and he says I'm going to do a work in you that even if you knew what it was you wouldn't believe it and then God says that um you know what let's just read it can you find it in your Bibles I marked it habakook won five it says this behold ye among ye among the Heathen and regard and wonder marvelously for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe though it be told to you so even if I tell you you're not going to believe what's about to happen for lo I raise up the Chaldeans that bitter and Hasty nation which shall March through the breadth of the land to possess The Dwelling Places that are not theirs so what he's saying right here is he's saying I'm going to raise up these Chaldeans the Babylonians Nebuchadnezzar I'm going to raise up these this this Evil Nation this nation that's even more evil than you are by the way the most evil nation in really all of the world I'm gonna raise them up and they're gonna come in and they're going to steamroll you guys so you can think of the prophet of the people like what we're bad but they're worse but God uses that and he says he says I'm going to bring this in and what Paul is saying is he's quoting this scripture and he's warning them listen this same thing could happen to you that happened here in have a cook the habakkuk prophesied was going to happen this same thing could happen to you I like that it's really a nice it was it's it's when Paul was is saying that you think wow that obscures scripture and Paul brings it out of the Old Testament and he says by the way he says you know what happened here with when the Babylonians came in you better be careful because that same thing could happen to you now when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews and religious prophets proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas who's speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God he didn't tell them to continue in the law he didn't tell them that the law was not applicable anymore he didn't say that the Old Testament is still the word of God but he says continue in the grace of God Jesus on the cross I preached it this morning that he said continue in that that he died for you and his grace upon all of us because of his sacrifice this cross and the next Sabbath day came and the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God I would love that I mean this is it was an amazing sermon and it was this this new gospel but the next Sabbath day came and almost the whole city came to hear the word of God wouldn't you love to see that Zeal in our day oh I would just how wonderful would that be well we see that what had happened that day right around that time that Paul had had smote the the um that evil soothsayer blind and the governor saw it and it was it was done openly and then Paul preaches this this beautiful sermon basically he's saying that the word of all of the prophets is true and you're interpreting it wrong and God fulfilled that in this man that went to the cross and by the grace of God your sins can be forgiven not through the law but through the blood of Christ but when the Jews saw it the multitudes here comes the human nature but when the Jews saw the multitude they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming so we see these people are jealous because they were having big meetings and they were so there was so much excitement and so much Zeal and when God raises up a work when he starts doing a work Paul said when I would do good evil as present with me and here it is right here they tried to tear it down how many times when we want to do something good how many times do with the does the devil just fight us tooth and nail it could be it could be having a meeting it could be something that would be a blessing to the people or it could be it could be a job or it could be whatever in our life that we feel that God is leading and then we hit a barrier we hit a setback and so often people just say Well it must not have been the Lord What if Paul would have said that right here right at this very point when everybody was raised up against him and he started started feeling all of these problems What if Paul would have said must not have been God maybe we'll go to the next city but he didn't do that then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life wow you talk about waxing bold that's bold and he's saying all of you that I just preached this sermon to Paul speaking that I just preached this sermon to I brought you from Genesis all the way to this day all the way to the Forerunner of Christ I showed you that there is no salvation in this law that there is salvation in this man Jesus and you have made the choice that you don't want it you want your traditions you've judged yourself Unworthy of everlasting life low we turn to the Gentiles and here we see a definitive change brother while we see that Paul now he has he was preaching they've been preaching to the Jews and Peter and Philip and Stephen and all of these ones have been preaching to the Jews and Paul says here he says Lo we turn to the Gentiles now for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth Paul was commissioned by none other than Jesus Christ himself to be a light to these Gentiles to bring this gospel to the Gentiles and now Paul is seeing here we go they've put us out now I'm going to fulfill this which God commissioned me to do on the road to Damascus so we have these hard Stony hearted people and they're saying they're doing everything they can to hinder this they're seeing these big meetings they don't like it they want to they want to put a stumbling block in it but here's the smile that you can put on your face and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad I'm a gentile you know I was like I come I come that that these people they accepted the Lord and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed praise God so the Gentiles were happy and yeah I bet they were happy this man Paul what what a man he was and they they were they were watching him preach and he just had such command to the scriptures he was so encouraging and he said you can be forgiven of your sins and not only did he just preach it but he showed it with signs and wonders and the word of the Lord was published throughout the region but the Jews stirred up now here we go again the problems but the Jews stirred up The Devout and honorable women the word honorable means prominent women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came to Iconium now to shake off the dust of your feet it was a Jewish expression of really of breaking Fellowship it was it was saying that you if you go back um Jesus I think he was forgot exactly where it was when he sent out the 70 and he sent them to preach the gospel and he says if you're not accepted and he sent out to 12 too and he says if you're not accepted he said Shake the Dust from your garments Shake It Off off of your feet and that was this that Jewish tradition of separating they turned it down we're done now he says they shook off the dust of their feet against them and they came to Iconium and we'll wrap it up here the musicians can come so Iconium brother Lyle was in the land of galatia and this next chapter that we hear if the Lord's willing and if he tarries until Wednesday brother Lyle will bring out this Acts chapter 14 and we're going to see these Brethren we're going to see the persecution really hit him we're going to see them going through this land of galatia from town to town traveling through Barnabas and and Paul and we're going to see how mean these people really get and they got mean they did everything that they could to hinder in this last verse verse 52. in closing it says this and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost I love the way it's it it's ended now as I've said before that the Bible in this book of Acts when it was written it wasn't written with chapters in it it was just written as one big long letter and the um fairly not too long ago they came in and they put the chapters in so that we could look it up but I like the way the place that they stopped this one and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost and I think how happy they must have been to see number one that God was with them we see that God protected them we'll see at lystra coming up in Acts chapter 4 that God God allows them by the way to suffer but he protects them he keeps them alive so that they can go and then they can preach elsewhere and it's beautiful that they're filled with joy and filled with the Holy Ghost amen do you like the book of Acts chapter 13 I love that sermon that Paul preached he started way back as I said in Genesis comes all the way through through um through the Patriarchs and through through the Wilderness comes to David shows that that David his lineage he's probably laying a foundation maybe for them at a later time but shows that David came and David prophesied that this man would come he came [Music] and you can see why everybody was so upset it's like by the way this legalism stuff it's good all of this this Old Testament it's all the truth but it was pointing to a place that you didn't go you took God's word and you took it to a place that God didn't want it to go but here in this man Christ Jesus is where that all the prophets pointed to where all the prophets spoke of is this man and in him and not in the law in him you have Redemption you have remission of your sins you have justification in him and him alone Christ only God bless you all let's let's stand brother I forgot your name there on the left I'm gonna get you to come up and close in prayer I forgot your name my brother yes come on up brother and if you lead us in a song oh his grace
