much I'm excited to be here tonight I trust you are too there's so much that we can learn from the books of the Minor Prophets about the Lord about his perspective of his people about life and Society in Bible times about what the Lord expects of us in the 21st century however and you knew there'd be however right so please take your seats for just a moment don't get too comfortable tonight at Sunset the 15th day of the seventh month in the Hebrew calendar the month of tshr there's a full moon tonight in fact it's a super moon tonight which means the moon is closer to the Earth so it appears larger and it's brighter and I think as his people as a church reflecting the light of the lord we should be in a super moon phase of Our Lives tonight as well reflecting Jesus Christ well tonight at Sunset the third of three feasts or holy days that the Lord commanded his people to observe by going to the place where he would put his name Jerusalem do you recall what those three feasts were Deuteronomy 16 we read three times in a year shall thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose in the Feast of unleavened bread we know that is Passover and as Christians we celebrate Easter in the Feast of Weeks that's Pentecost Lord set everything up so that in Acts two Peter would have the audience when the Holy Spirit fell and in the Feast of Tabernacles Tabernacles it means tents booths Huts temporary structures and they shall not appear before the Lord empty every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee Tabernacles is at the end of the harvest season it's a time of celebration of the bounty of the land in worship to the Lord and expressing thanks for the Lord who gave such a bounty and recalling the years of wandering As Told in Exodus and not just that but every seventh year Deuteronomy 31 Moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi which bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and unto all the Elders of Israel and Moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years in the solity of the year of release in the Feast of Tabernacles when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose thou the priests and the elders shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing gather the people together men and women and children and the stranger that's within your Gates that they may hear that they may learn and fear the lord your God and to observe to do all the words of this law and that their children which have not known anything may hear and learn to fear the lord your God as long as you live in the land whether you go over Jordan to possess it it was during this week-long Gathering every seventh year the entire book of the law was to be read aloud to everyone not just in Jerusalem not just to the male pilgrims we saw this reading occur in Nehemiah chapter 8 spoiler alert looking ahead in our series of all the feasts and observances Tabernacles is the one the Lord emphasized in zachariah's Visions describing a future Kingdom on the earth Zechariah 14 we read the Lord shall be king over all the Earth and that day shall there be one Lord and his name one we look forward to that day it shall come to pass that everyone that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles not Passover not Pentecost Tabernacles this celebration is done in temporary structures with a loose roof so one can see the stars of Heaven through it and the full moon it's a time of sharing of meals with friends and neighbors I remember these occasions when I worked at l in Israel and during sucot at lunch go to the cafeteria get your meal go out into a big Suka they had set up there and just mingle with people and share the booster Tabernacles recall the wandering after leaving Egypt and prior to entering the land of promise reflecting on total dependence on the Lord for life and sustenance in a harsh place that could not support the population a continuous 40 years long miracle for a people being punished for refusing to take the land when 10 of the spies brought a bad report there are of course many Traditions associated with the celebrations Leviticus 23:40 he shall take on you the first day the bows of goodly trees branches of palm trees the boughs of thick trees and Willows of the brook and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days suot to me this signifies that we should Gather in in spite of differences break down walls that separate to celebrate the Bounty of the Lord to have genuine Fellowship together and worship and praise the Lord together not just during this Feast but all the time I I personally find it curious that of the three feasts that the Lord especially emphasizes and Christianity we observe the first two in some fashion but the third Tabernacles we generally ignore finally sukot is a perfect leadin for this evening's study and now to our book this evening Amos that's the Hebrew pronunciation Hebrew almost always accents the final cylinder Heather tells me in Spanish it is Amos I used to say Amos I'm likely to say it all three ways this evening so if I say Amos or Amos or Amos I'm talking about the same guy and the same book okay and and almost by the way means burdened or or burdensome difficult to carry out or or fulfill and he carried such a burden of Prophecy which he delivered before we dig into this book please let's stand together one more time and approach the Lord in prayer father we are in awe of you we're so grateful that you've given us the privilege to live in the 21st century to be here present at this time to be gathered together of our own free will Lord to hear from you Lord nobody's here to hear from Lyle Johnson nobody cares and he has nothing worth hearing to say but Lord we're here to hear from you all of us each of us so Lord speak to our hearts help us to lay aside the burdens of the day our thoughts everything Lord and just focus concentrate on you be sensitive to what you might say Lord Seagle my lips against saying anything that would cause anyone to stumble Lord and and anoint the ears of everyone that's hearing that they hear what you have this evening for them we thank you and we praise you and we're here in expectation Lord Jesus amen for our opening verses and before we're seated I'd like to I've got two I'd like to first read a short account from the gospels Jesus being challenged during his final week in Jerusalem was asked about the greatest commandment Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets this is a wonderful preview of The Book of Amos this book emphasizes both of these principles and next an account from 2 Chronicles of an event that occurred about a century before the ministry of amosa the scene is that a massive Army has gathered comprised of several of the enemies of Judah they're on the shores of the Dead Sea near engedi King Jehoshaphat in the Judean Hills has turned to the Lord for help 2 Chronicles 2012 is the end of his prayer let's read Oh Our God wil thou not judge them we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee it's always good advice just like Hezekiah and the days of Isaiah's prophecy and all Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children Unity everyone standing together from the youngest to the oldest boys and girls men and women and in this unity in this hush turning to the Lord then upon yahel the son of Zachariah the son of bananah the son of yel the son of matani we given this identity because he's an unknown to us he's just a member of the priesthood a levite of the sons of Asaf Asaf you recall wrote some of the Psalms on this guy suddenly like out of nowhere came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and jahaziel said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King jehos ofet that that's pretty bold telling the king to pay attention to the simple priest thus saith the Lord unto you individually and collectively Be not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's tomorrow go ye down against them that means opposite them behold they come up by the Cliff of ziz they can't hide from me and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jerel you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you go face this overwhelming Force against which you have no chance Don't Run Away don't flee don't hide face the enemy and see what the Lord Lord will do for you and Jehoshaphat showing good Godly leadership before all the people the king to which everyone else bows bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord following jehoshaphat's example and the Levites of the children of the coites and of the children of the kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high no notice they're praising the Lord for his Deliverance before the battle is fought is is fought the enemy is still Gathering out there marshalling together the enemy hasn't been engaged they have confidence they have trust they're putting their faith in the words of an unknown prophet and they arose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tcoa remember this location to COA and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said perhaps his most Sage advice and Direction and admonition of his life hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established safe upheld endure believe His prophets so shall you prosper can we read that advice together out loud believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe His prophets so shall you prosper maybe one more time believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe His prophets so shall you prosper and when jeos had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that they should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before in front of leading the way before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever maybe we can all repeat that too praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever and when they began to sing and to praise not before not they saw something and began to sing they began to sing and pra prise and when that happened just like we were doing as I came up to the pulpit this evening at that time then the Lord set ambushments against the children of Amon Moab and mount seir which were come up against Judah and they were smitten how did the Lord do that just just one more verse for the children of Aman and Moab two of the groups that were United against Judah stood up against the inhabitants of Mount seir the third component of their Alliance Adam the descendants of Esau utterly to to slay and Destroy them and when they had made an end to the inhabitants of seir everyone helped to destroy another they turned on each other the Lord took away their Unity please be seated if I were a preacher I'd spend the next few hours expounding on the lessons of this portion of 2 Chronicles but I'm not so I won't besides tonight's about Amos I read this portion of scripture because it deals with the importance of hearing and believing what the Lord says through His prophets and Amos was such a prophet and because it takes place in the wilderness of tcoa where the spirit of the Lord fell on OS in the form of Prophecy and like jhazel Amos was an unlikely candidate to be a prophet OS is II among the group we call Minor Prophets minor simply means the amount of written prophets that they left as less than the amount of the Major Prophets like Isaiah or Ezekiel let's start start the study and by the way young people there's a quiz hopefully you have your quiz okay we'll start with verse one of chapter one of Amos we're trying to get context here the words of Amos who was among the herdmen and that means sheep herders and sheep breeders of tcoa which he saw concerning Israel and the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of Israel two years before the earthquake well this verse identifies almost by name tells us his occupation where he worked and lived and the approximate time of his ministry based on the overlapping period of The reigns of the two kings and then he says oh and by the way this was two years before the earthquake not an earthquake but the earthquake H well first let's get Geographic context we'll use references from the reading of 2 Chronicles on the right side is an overall map showing the kingdom of Judah and violet and Israel in green the area inside the red box is expanded on the left side of the screen there I've marked the three nations gathered against Jehosaphat in rectangular boxes Amon Moab and Edom you can see that their neighbors the enemy armies are gathered at inti marked with a blue oval on the shores of the Dead Sea I'm sure you can see that right there and the path they will March is in red I've also indicated the locations of Jerusalem and tcoa with green ovals you can see tcoa is slightly South and a bit West of Jerusalem a distance of only 11 or 12 miles I've also marked bethl with yellow oval where where Amos will be delivering his message to Israel as you can see it's in Israel and you recall from our earlier uh lessons on in Kings and Samuel and so forth that that's where the first guy named jeroboam set up uh Idols to be worshiped there so people wouldn't go to Jerusalem well here's a satellite view of of the same areas you can see tcoa is on the edge of the Judean Hills where the land rapidly drops into the parched Bleak desert Wilderness leading to the Dead Sea the Hills are about 2,000 ft above sea level of tcoa the Dead Sea 1300 ft below sea level the lowest point on the surface of the Earth takoa is where the spirit of the Lord falls on a sheep breeder of Judah to deliver a prophetic message to the Kingdom of Israel well with a geographic context established let's see if we can be more precise about the the date of the beginning of amamos Prophecy what is this about the earthquake it was a well-known event back in the day some 250 years after Amo Zachariah would write yay ye shall flee like as you fled from before the earthquake and the days of Uzziah king of Judah turns out there's widespread evidence of a massive earthquake that occurred in the mid 8th Century BC throughout the Levant the POR of the Middle East that includes Israel a combination of that evidence biblical texts and even a comment from Josephus helps us nail this down most Scholars that study this sort of thing agree it was in 760 BC a few say 750 either way we know his ministry was then in the days of Hosea Isaiah and probably Micah and even Jonah the the photo has an arrow pointing to a tilting wall of an ancient Fortress and that tilt to that wall is from earthquake damage based on all the archaeological finds there's lots of things you can't read over here those are all places where they found evidence of of an earthquake the epicenter has been pretty well located in what is now Lebanon the magnitude is thought to have been about 8.2 this is a massive earthquake for example in May of 2008 a slightly smaller magnitude 7.9 Quake struck Eastern chesan China who resulting in over 87,500 deaths let's take one more brief detour to help establish context this time to 2 Kings 14 verses 23 to 29 are the only record we really have of the reign of King jeroboam II in Israel though he is referred to many times as we just read in verse one of almost this helps us understand the social and economic context of Israel at the time of Amos Ministry we need this context to understand why the prophecy is the way the prophecy is why the Lord is focused on the things he's focused on 2 Kings 14 in the 15th year of amziah the son of joash King of Judah jeroboam the son of joash of Israel began to reign in Samaria and he reigned 41 years it's a long time especially with the kings in those days what sort of King was this guy he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord he departed not from a few or some no he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nabat who made Israel to sin setting up Idols in bethl and Dan encouraging unfaithfulness to the Lord this is now the second king named jeroboam so we call him jeroboam II jeroboam the second second restored the borders of Israel from the entering of hamat Unto the Sea of the plain according to the word of the Lord God of Israel which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah son of amiti the Prophet which was of gaer this is the same Jonah whose book we'll study in a couple of weeks he's this evil guy but he's restoring the borders according according to a prophecy from Jonah for the Lord saw the Affliction of Israel that it was very bitter for there was not any shut up nor any left no one slave or free was spared nor any helper for Israel nobody to help them and the Lord said that had not said that he would blot out what happened there we go sorry but maybe it's my personality getting too close to that thing I don't know I hope not there was not any helper for Israel the Lord had said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven but he saved them by the hand of this very jeroboam the son of joash the one who did evil in the sight of the Lord now the rest of the acts of jeroboam all that he did his might how he wared how he recovered Damascus and hamat which belonged to Judah for Israel are they not written in the book of The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel and jeroboam slept with his fathers even with the Kings of Israel and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead so we see he was an evil King yet the Lord used him to protect and preserve Israel this was prophesied by the very Jonah that would go to Nineveh and preserve them and they would then conquer and destroy the nation of Israel some 40 years after Jonah's Ministry there under jeroboam II Israel was Victorious they gained strength they gained wealth a new era of prosperity had arrived in Israel yet the nation continued to turn its back on the Lord and not only in worship but on the very Foundation of their society there are many ways to divide the book into sections or topics or themes this is just one you'll no doubt notice the term judgment appears along with guilt punishment destruction what do you think of when you hear the term the Judgment of God or God proclaiming judgment is it positive or negative to be embraced or to be feared to be welcomed or shun remember the story of Ahab Jezebel and the vineyard of nobot nobot was killed so Ahab could have a Vineyard he wanted but didn't need we'll see in the most that the Lord has harsh words for certain elements of Israel's Society under the law there was a jubilee every 50 years when land ownership was restored one never sold the land it was effectively leased for no more than 40 9 years perhaps to raise money to pay a debt this is described in Leviticus 25 8- 55 but over time this had changed we'll see that in Amos that the Lord was very unhappy about the changes we'll see how this ties into the concept of judgment and its intended result Justice this is a good time I think to introduce the theme of Osa prophecies and that theme is God's passionate concern for justice Hebrew word happens to be mishpat what is Justice or what the King James version calls judgment what do you think of when you hear those words under Mosaic law The landholding Peasants or subsistence farmers were the foundation of Israel's society when Joshua led the conquest the division was of land not wealth not gold or silver or plunder if you will it was all about land and land is all about agriculture you'll notice when you read in the Old Testament ties were of crops and livestock offerings were generally not of money but of sacrificial animals Israel's renewed Prosperity under jeroboam II brought New Wealth to the upper classes the rich became richer the poor became poorer government including the courts was corrupt notice I mentioned at the beginning of this evening's lesson that sukot ties in perfectly with Amos we we read Deuteronomy 16: 16 and 17 about the men going to Jerusalem to observe this Feast let's read just the next three verses verse 18 judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy Gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy tribes throughout the land not just in particular cities and they shall judge the people with just judgment settle disputes with complete fairness and a warning Thou shalt not rest that means to twist or distort or pervert or misapply or misinterpret judgment Thou shalt not respect persons show no favoritism or partiality whether it's the king or a slave neither take a gift never accept a bribe however it may be disguised for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise and pervert the words of the rightous it reminds me of a time I was doing work in the aircraft industry and I went to Los Angeles to the FAA and we were trying to get something resolved about some modifications we were making to an aircraft and the fellow that I was meeting with we hit pretty well and we went down to get lunch in the cafeteria and I offered to buy his lunch I wasn't thinking about anything I was 27 years old or something and he no can't can't do that that's influence oh okay I I learned that lesson then but he was an ethical person and he was making sure that I was an ethical person I guess so pay close attention to the next verse that which is altogether just uncompromisingly righteous True Justice and Justice alone shalt thou follow and the benefits of this include that thou mayest live and inherit the land which the Lord thy God God giveth thee back to the land almost Ministry was a call to the leadership of Israel to repent and reform if they did not the Injustice to the poor and the weak would destroy the nation the Lord would not allow them to continue in such a way two choices were available repentance and reform or retribution Mercy or punishment choices recall our reading from Matthew love the Lord and love your neighbor if there's Injustice you're not loving your neighbor or the Lord if I had to reduce the entire Book of Amos to just one verse it would be this let judgment run down as Waters and righteousness as a mighty stream I I took a crack at trying to decode the Hebrew there and that's the King James version the Lyall Johnson version is let Justice roll down as water and righteousness as a Perpetual torrent sounds good to be desired but what is righteousness what what what is this thing that the Lord wants what is righteousness Sak what is it what do you think of how does it apply in your life or in mine dictionary says righteousness is the quality or state of being righteous it is the actor conduct of one who is righteous it sounds pretty circular to me what does righteous mean according to Webster it's it's an adjective acting in accord with Divine or moral law free from guilt or sin that same Hebrew word is translated innocent in other places morally right or justifiable like a righteous decision arising from an outraged sense of justice or morality like righteous indignation in God's eyes the Divine or moral law is from him it's according to the Bible every seventh year review all of this a person who is a radical Muslim might believe he's living in righteousness by killing one he considers an Infidel according to Sharia law so the laws to which you're striving to conform matter Isaiah tells us for the Lord is our judge the Lord is our lawgiver the Lord is our King he will save us and almost a righteous person was one who obey made the written law which came through Moses in our day Paul wrote in Romans 10 Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law that the man that does these things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise it says the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess With Thine mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness it's declared righteous acceptable to God and with a mouth confession is made to Salvation what the Lord desired at Amos day he still desires in our day today righteousness comes by faith righteousness is is a quality that results in being right in the eyes of God including our character or nature our conscience or attitude our conduct or actions our words one more thing to establish and then we'll dig into the book Let's establish what we know about OS the man we saw in the opening vers he was a sheep herder wasn't a priest he wasn't a levite he wasn't a trained Prophet or anything he owned his sheep he was not a hired Shepherd by the same token he tended his own sheep he was not wealthy enough to hire a Shepherd in chapter 7 OS had delivered most of his prophecies he was in Israel at at bethl and was ordered to leave and returned to Judah by a priest named amziah then answered Amos said to amziah I was no Prophet neither was I a prophet son I was a Herdman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit and the Lord took me as I followed the flock and the Lord said unto me go go to Israel prophesy unto My People Israel almost apparently own no pasture Lander if he did it wasn't year round pasture Shepherds would move the Sheep to suitable pasture and in Amo case and probably many others this was regularly on land used to raise Sycamore fig trees while the Sheep grazed almost worked for the owner of the orchard for the right to graze the Sheep there how do we know what was not his own Sycamore Grove the King James uses a curious term gatherer of the fruit my first reaction when I read this was oh he harvested the fruit he gathered it up right but I don't know if that's what you think when you see that that's what I thought it's not the case other translations say he tended or dressed or took care of it well what's going on it's time to dig in fact the Hebrew word Bas translated gatherer occurs only once in the entire Bible and its root means pinched that doesn't mean like today if somebody pinches something we mean that they took it when they shouldn't have but pinched these fruits or figs at a certain stage needed to be punctured or cut slightly to hasten their ripening a very tedious and labor intensive task I I I found this from a domestication of plants in the old world from the Oxford University press in 2001 you can see a picture of of of these of these figs Sumer more ripe than others and I'll just help summarize this because I'm sure it's a little hard for you to read there the cultivation of the Sycamore fig has been almost exclusively an Egyptian specialty compared with a common fig it is a much taller and larger tree where did we run across that zakus come down from there I'm going to spend the afternoon with you was a sycamore fig tree that zakus was in that is the part of Israel one of the parts of Israel where these trees were but it produces smaller fruit since early dynastic times in Egypt going on back to the time of Abraham and before the Sycamore fig was and still is commonly used fruit crop and valued Timber Source in the lower Nile Valley the Sycamore fig was introduced into warmer parts of Israel cultivation depends on rooting of Twigs rather than seeds some varieties bear fruit without pollenization while in others fruit maturation is artificially induced by gashing the surface of the young seonia the fruit this is an old tradition in Egypt and in Israel gashing puncturing the service isn't it amazing what you can learn just by trying to understand the meaning of a single word in the Bible Well from all of this we see that OS was a man of the people he was not of any privileged class the Lord sent him from Judah to prophesy to Israel he was likely in Israel only a few weeks before he had to return to the Sheep the fact that he indicates his ministry occurred two years before the earthquake rather than here's a list of Kings where my Ministry was or my Ministry started two years before the earthquake he says this happened two years before the earthquake it suggests it was a very brief public Ministry well let's look at some of his prophecies chapter by chapter starting with the first one after introducing himself almost lists five judgments of God on Israel's neighbors each follows a similar pattern we'll look at the second one against Gaza it's the same physical General geographic area of the Gaza that's in the news today and has been for the last year almost 1 16 thus sayith the Lord for three transgressions of Gaza and for for I will not turn away the punishment thereof because They Carried Away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to Edom in other words the city the people they took they took them all to Edom Edom you recall was the territory of Esau Jacob's twin but I will send fire on the wall of Gaza which shall Devour the Palaces thereof for three transgressions no make it four God doesn't have a bad memory he's been around a long time a lot longer than I have I have problems with my memory God does not have problems with his and he can count accurately so this is an idiom it's an expression which tells us the Lord is weary of the continuing transgressions of Gaza next the nature of the problem is told in all five of these the Lord is holding the count the country the region or the people to a much lower standard than he holds Israel because they're not part of the Covenant it's just stuff that they should know better in the case of Edom it's the ongoing grudge against Jacob held over many generations as Edom assisted Israel's enemies Esau their ancestor knew better each prophecy ends with fire that destroys the Palaces or strongholds of the king or ruler in chapter two the Lord moves on to Judah and Israel and this is all that he says about Judah the rest of it pretty much is about Israel so I'm displaying the King James but I'm going to read you the text from the NLT so you can follow it there but what I'm saying is might be a little clearer this is what the Lord says the people of Judah have sinned again and again and I will not let them go unpunished they have rejected the instruction of the Lord refusing to obey his decrees they have been LED astray by the same lies that deceived their ancestors verse five so I will send down fire on Judah and all the fortresses of Jerusalem will be destroyed the remainder of chapter two is a much lengthier judgment pronounced on the Kingdom of Israel well let's go to chapter 3 verses from this chapter are often quoted so let's read all 15 verses it'll take less than two hours so bear with me OS 3:1 hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you oh children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore I will punish you for your iniquities then he starts giving a list of contrasts can two walk together except they be agreed we hear a lot of this what does that mean does that mean to be in lock step you agree with every thought I have and if you don't well you must be wrong and I must be right I can't have fellowship with you what did Brother Brandon say about this sort of thing he said check your motive check your objective why are you doing this going or not going what are you trying to achieve or avoid it's often used as an excuse to draw a smaller Circle to avoid Fellowship to assert exclusivity let me tell you a little story I I I used to work with a fellow I worked for a very small company in California for a number of years and we had a very small engineering team and it was this other fellow and myself and there were one or two other people that helped from time to time and we developed a lot of products but that's not what this is about the point is that this fellow that I worked with he he his his mother was a preacher in the Unitarian Church which basically says make up your own religion you're welcome here so he told me that well about the age 12 he stopped believing in Jesus and and he had a little bit of this attitude and I think that he was an agnostic trying to be an atheist or or or something like that and so we had a number of discussions and and and and and and I early on realized that this wasn't this and it wasn't this but I I I would say to to him when he would bring something up I'd say Wayne I I I appreciate you're sharing that with me as a person of faith I see it this way oh yeah there's a cross on the front of the pulpit it's about perspective right those of you here Sunday morning know that reference so so what so I would explain to him where I was coming from I'd understand where he was coming from but I wasn't trying to persuade him he was wrong and I was right or the other way just so we could understand each other and then we could set that aside and walk together as Engineers developing some pretty amazing products as a very small team where we had to cooperate very very closely we became very close over the years that we worked together even though we're very very different people so this doesn't mean you have to be in lock step or agreement with somebody but what's your motive what's your objective how can two walk together except they'd be agreed will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he had taken nothing again I I and the business that I was in when I lived in Tucson more decades ago than I care to think about used to go to South Africa fairly regularly on business and i' go into uh uh Krueger Park from time to time and and go up in someplace where you can get out of your car and nobody catches you can get out of your car and and you can observe it and here's springb walk over here these deer that are feeding and here's a pride of lions over here and the lions are very quiet and you see the lionist leave the pride stealthily absolutely quietly downwind from the deer and the deer they sense something's going on very quiet until the lion Springs and maybe it catches prey and and maybe it doesn't but it brings that prey back then the Lions make noise we're having our dinner stay away or you'll be next the Lions don't make noise when they're doing about their business so he's saying a lion doesn't Roar without a reason okay same thing can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth when there's no trap set for him there's there's no bait shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all the the trap on the earth isn't going to Spring unless something steps on it the bird's not going to fly into oh that looks like a trap I think I'll just fly into thatn there's got to be something to draw it in we we at our house every now and then we've had pack routes around and I put out live traps for those things and and and that's how I catch them and if I don't put bait in the Trap it's empty in the morning I'm glad when the trap's empty but not because I forgot the bait so let's move on to the next next one shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid that was the warning that an enemy is approaching shall there be evil in this city and the Lord hath not done it he hasn't allowed it he hasn't planned it verse seven surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret into his servants of prophets that doesn't mean that God isn't going to do anything the prophet's got to do it all it's not saying that at all he's saying before the Lord does anything anything he'll warn he'll tell His prophets just like Amos here is warning Israel about what's going to happen if they don't wake up and pay attention then the Lord goes ahead and does it the prophet doesn't do it the Lord does it he always warns us before Calamity this whole book of Amos is just that a warning a call to repentance and reform it's not because God wants to punish the people the lion ha roared almost goes on and says this is the conditions under which a lion roars the lion has roared he has his prey don't approach him or he'll attack you like a rattlesnake rattling the Lord has spoken who can but prophesy publish in the Palaces at ashdod these are not their friends and in the Palaces in the land of Egypt and say assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria Samaria was the capital of Israel behold the great tumults in the midst thereof and the oppressed in the midst thereof witness the open oppression of the weak the chaos that is in Israel for they know not to do right sayith the Lord they who store up violence and robbery what they have taken and looted in their palaces and their strongholds therefore because of this oppression thus sayeth the Lord and add adversary shall there'll be even round about the land and he shall bring down thy strength from thee and thy palaces thy stronghold shall be spoiled you the one that's going to be looted now thus saith the Lord as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed and in Damascus and a couch there'll be a tiny Remnant that that will survive these coming disasters hear ye and testify in the house of Jacob saith the Lord God the god of hosts that in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of bethl the the idol worship established when the nation was divided and the horns the power the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground no one worships the idol at bethl anymore the horns of that altar have been broken and I will Smite the winter house with the summer house and the houses of ivory Shall Perish and the great houses shall have an end sayeth the Lord the houses of the wealthy the houses of the corrupt the oppressors of the people they'll be destroyed that's chapter three in chapter four The Lord continues to plead with Israel he even uses sarcasm to gain their attention now we know we've heard examples where the Lord has a sense of humor did you know that he uses sarcasm look Amos 44 the Lord is speaking come to bethl and transgress at gilo multiply transgression bring your sacrifices every morning in your tithes after three years offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving with leaven and Proclaim and publish the free offerings tell everybody what you've done how big of an offering you made for this is what you like to do oh ye children of Israel sayeth the Lord he's not telling them to go there and do that sarcasm I thought it was interesting that the Lord would speak in such a way just to get their attention they don't seem to be listening any other way the Lord continues in this chapter to call attention to every device he has used to get their attention since they ignore the law and the prophets verse six I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities that doesn't mean he sent them dentists and want of bread in all your palaces yet ye have not returned unto me sayeth the Lord in other words he's used famine to get their attention your teeth are clean because you got nothing to eat I've withheld rain yet you have not returned to me I've sent mildew and pestilence yet you have not returned to me I've sent Palmer worms to destroy your Vines and fruit trees I've over thrown some of you I've slain your young men with a sword yet ye have not returned to me return means repent therefore verse 12 thus will I do unto thee oh Israel and because I will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy God o Israel but they seem to have forgotten who God is so he identifies himself for Lo he that forth the mountains and createth the wind and declareth unto man what is his thought that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high places of the Earth the Lord the god of hosts is his name I'm the one that did all this that's giving you this warning chapter five pointing out the error and wickedness it abounds in Israel the Lord keeps appealing to them leaving the door open for repentance reform righteousness just a few sections for verse four thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel seek me and ye shall live verse six seek the Lord and ye shall live lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph Joseph is used here as as a synonym if you will for Israel represents the northern kingdom Joseph's children ephra and Manasseh had their inheritance and they had the largest inheritance in the Northern Kingdom of Israel lest I break out I he break out like fire in the house of Joseph and devoured and there be none to quench it and bethl focus of idol worship ye who turn judgment Justice to Wormwood and leave off righteousness and the Earth verse 10 they they hate him that rebuke in the gate they abore him that speaketh uprightly they hate Justice they abore the righteous for as much therefore as your treading is upon the poor and you take from him burdens of wheat corruption bribes excessive taxation ye have built houses of heed Stone but you shall not dwell in them ye have planted Pleasant Vineyards but ye shall not drink the wine of them for I know your manifold transgressions and your Mighty sins they afflict the just they take a bribe they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right but even even in all this seek good and not evil that she may live and so the Lord the god of hosts shall be with you as you have spoken hate the evil love the good establish judgment in the gate it may be that the Lord of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph of Israel and then building up to what I called our theme verse the Lord is speaking again to them he says I hate no I despise your feast days I will not smell your solemn assemblies though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings I will not accept them neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts take thou away from me the noise of thy songs I will not hear The Melody of thy vials but let judgment run down as Waters righteous as a mighty stream chapter six begins with woe to them that are at EAS in Zion he he describes their ostentatious luxury uh they that drink wine and bowls anoint themselves with the chief ointments but they are not grieved for the Affliction of Joseph of Israel therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive and the banquet of them that stretch themselves stretched out on the couches shall be removed in chapter 7 almost has two visions in which he pleads with the Lord to Spirit rer the Lord says I'm going to do this and Amos almost says Lord Israel is small and weak please don't destroy him and the Lord says okay you're right I won't do that so that happens twice reminds us of Moses a third Vision ends this way almost 79 and the high places of Isaac again representing Israel shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise against the house the dynasty of jeroboam with the sword verse 10 then amziah the priest of beel sent to jeroboam king of Israel saying Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the House of Israel the land is not able to Bear all his words remember his name means burdensome and he's delivering that burden for thus saith Amos jeroboam shall die by The Sword and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land also amziah said to Amos oh thou sear go go flee thee away into the land of Judah and there eat bread and prophesy there but prophesy not again anymore at bethl for it is the King's Chapel and it is the King's Court then answered Amos and said to amziah was no Prophet neither was I a prophet's son I was a Herdman a gatherer of sycamore fruit the Lord took me as I followed the flock and the Lord said to me go prophesy unto My People Israel now I'm Messiah therefore hear thou the word of the Lord thou sayest prophesy not against Israel and drop not Thy word against the house of Isaac Israel therefore thus saith the Lord thy wife shall be in harlot in the city thy sons and thy daughters shall fall By The Sword and thy land shall be divided by line and thou shalt die in a polluted land and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land you can send me away but it's not going to change anything chapter 8 the theme continues verse four hear this oh ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor of the land to fail saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell grain and the Sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the epath small and the Shuckle great and falsifying the balances by deceit fewer goods for more money does that sound familiar kind of like shrink flation I I grab my my my H gallon jug of orange juice that I get at Costco it used to be 64 oun now it's 59 ooun price didn't go down but there's less of it okay that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes yay and sell The Refuge of the wheat in other words they're selling wheat they're selling grain but the chaff that's supposed to be taken away from the threshing floor they're missing the chaff with the wheat they're giving bad grain they're they're stuffing it they're diluting it they're polluting it the Lord has sworn by the Excellency of Jacob surely I will never when never forget any of their works well skipping down to verse 11 remember what amziah told Amos to go back to Judah and not prophesy to Israel again we just read that in chapter 7 811 behold the days come sayeth the Lord that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst of water but of hearing the words of the Lord and and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it brother Bram quoted this many times identify it as being in the last days and being in his lifetime and it was manifested as denomination division a lack of courage to say the truth where are we now well the concluding chapter is chapter nine it starts with the prophecy of the destruction of the northern kingdom but ends with the promise of the restoration of the people starting at at verse eight behold the eyes of the Lord were upon the sinful Kingdom and I will destroy it from off the face of the Earth saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob I'll destroy the kingdom but I'll save some of the people for lo I will command I will sift the house of Israel among all nations like as grain is sifted in a Sie yet shall not the least grain fall upon the Earth all the Sinners of my people shall die by the sword which say oh the evil shall never overtake or stop us and the final the closing message of Hope the promise of restoration and that day I will raise up the Tabernacle of David that is fallen and close up the breaches thereof and and I will raise up his ruins and I will build it as in the days of old that they may possess the remnant of Edom and of all the he Heathen which are called by my name the Heathen called by my name that's us that's us Stephen when he was being martyred in Acts 15 that's he quoted this and said this is the Gentiles that are coming into the Lord now which are called by my name sayith the Lord that doeth this behold the days come sayeth the Lord that the plowman shall overtake the reaper the Treader of grapes him that se his seed and the mountain shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt in other words the barren lands will become exceedingly fruitful you'll still be harvesting when the guy's coming out to sew more seed because it's so Bountiful if you're taking notes that's Leviticus 26 verse5 and Joel 3 ver8 and I will bring again the Captivity in other words I will restore my people of Israel that I can go become captives again he's going to take them from captivity they're going to be restored brought again and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them they shall plant Vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make Gardens and eat the fruit of them and I will plant them upon their land and and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them sayith the Lord thy God what a beautiful promise the amazing grace of our Lord the musicians would would please come what lessons can we take home from Amos while Amos prophecies are directed to Israel the northern kingdom they give us a clear view from the Lord's perspective of what's important in addition to honest worship of the Lord how we treat each other especially those who are in some sense under our care or protection or less fortunate is very important I'll close by rereading from Matthew's gospel Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets I think these words of Jesus summarize the Book of Amos eloquently I think that's a lesson for us for today and with that thought that context let's close this portion of the service and pass it back to brother Daniel as we worship and song with a song that we used to sing back around 70 7172 every week the Youth of the church would get together and we'd sing songs and back in those days my hands work and I even played the guitar um but the Friday evening youth Gatherings back then we sang this song it shall flow like a river I don't know if you know it but that's the entire song it's not hard and we'll sing it two or three times so that you can get the hang of it about the time you've got it will probably stop it shall flow like a river it shall fall like the rain it shall rise as the Jew in the morning or the [Music] for the know of the Lord shall fill all the earth and the spirit of the Lord shall [Music] fall it shall flow like a river it shall fall like the rain it shall rise as the Dew in the morning over the plain for the knowledge of the Lord shall fill all the earth and the spirit of the Lord shall fall once more it shall flow like a river it shall fall like the rain it shall rise as the do in the morning or the plain for the know of the Lord shall f all the earth and the spirit of the Lord shall fall amen you like The Book of Amos yes it's a it's a powerful book it's full of Prophecy it's full of Correction I I think I don't mean to say that that um we've heard it before but it seems like every book that we go through the Bible says the same thing over and over I think the Amos can be summed up I think it was um One A Familiar verse that we all know Amos 8 verse 11 says this behold the days come sayeth the Lord that I will send a famine in the land and not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord when we neglect that is when we open the door for sin to come into our lives that's when we open the door for failure to manifest itself it's when we open the door for our children to go astray is when we lose track of the word of the Lord and it becomes a rare thing in our homes it becomes a rare thing in our churches it becomes a rare thing in our lives and then go back over to Amos chap 5 5 verse 14 and here is the repeat over and over in the book in whether it be the Minor Prophets whether it be Isaiah whether it be in in the Chronicles it's always the same thing seek good and not evil and love the good I'm sorry and seek good and not evil that you may live and and so the Lord the god of hosts shall be with you as you have spoken hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the gate it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph Brothers and Sisters the book it repeats itself over and over and brother Lyall and I can come up here and we can go through each book of the Bible like we're going and we can learn about each learn about the prophet we can learn about the historic context of the book and and of jeroboam II and how evil he was and how the people would stray from the Lord but it history has a way of repeating itself from the Garden of Eden when they wanted evil rather than good and then over and over and over brother Dennis it just happens back over and over and over again that the people want evil instead of good and then God steps on the scene and brings hardship and it usually turns them back turns them back to the Lord Brother Dennis you come up and close um brother Mark s sister Martha right God bless you welcome we appreciate you joining us brother Dennis come on up and close we um we go through we're going through the Bible chapter by or book by book and on Wednesday night bible study brother Theo and I are trading off and uh we're going Prophet by Propet book by book and uh it's it just more and more it hammers at home that when there is that famine in the land that famine for hearing the word of God and brothers and sisters it's not like like we heard in Joel where it was a swarm of locust that came through this famine for the word we bring upon ourselves because we don't spend the time we don't spend the time in prayer we don't spend the time in study we don't spend the time hearing the word and we bring these hardships upon us but God's a good god he's a loving God and even though we may stray just as our children stray sometime and we have to punish them to bring them back God is a loving God and he will he he brings us back through hardship as he's done with Israel every time and uh it's going to happen again but I thank God that the blood of Jesus Christ is upon us and even though in my failures and my faults I thank God that that he has his love brings chastisement to me to my family and uh we should we should always thank God for not just the prosperous times but also think thank God when he brings chastisement upon us and the hardships come and it makes us just look more towards him let's all stand [Music] let's just bow our heads together this evening Heavenly Father we love your word and that's always been our life Lord from the very start Lord your voice to our heart Lord and we love it we maybe on week nights get a little weary Lord but it's always good it's always good Lord and we pray tomorrow we look forward if you would give us tomorrow Lord we look for you when we rise in the morning and face our day we watch for your hand your presence and we just want to tell you tonight that we love you and appreciate this place to come and gather around your word and we commit our s to you now we ask you to hide that word in our heart yes amen Lord Maybe a lot to digest in one evening but we're believing that you can bring it to our remembrance in the hour of need Lord we thank you for it and as we go we pray you'd go with us and lead us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen amen it will be worth it all when we see Jes life trials will seem so small when we see cry one glimp of his dear face all all sorrow will be reain so bravely run the rain till we see CHR it will be worth it all when we see Jesus life's TRS will seem so small when we see chist one glimpse of his dear F all sorrows with he made so bravely run the PR till we see amen God bless you brothers and sisters um as I said in my WhatsApp broadcast this morning we got
