[28:38] once
[28:40] i

[29:12] but now i'm cleansed from every stain

[29:53] [Music]
[29:59] [Music]

[30:12] am set free
[30:16] once
[30:17] i

[31:04] first of
[31:06] me
[31:10] and
[31:12] purchased
[31:14] my salvation
[31:17] [Music]
[31:28] you were singing alleluia but with the
[31:30] verse what a friend let's do that one
[31:32] more time
[31:35] what a friend
[31:38] we
[31:41] have in jesus
[31:43] [Music]
[31:47] all our
[31:49] sins and
[31:52] grace
[31:54] [Music]
[32:10] everything to
[32:16] hallelujah one more time
[32:24] [Music]
[32:37] hallelujah
[32:40] [Music]
[33:08] amen it's something about that song
[33:12] and as if brother matt was leading
[33:14] anything that what a friend we have in
[33:16] jesus
[33:19] you might think of the best friend you
[33:20] have somebody has been dear to you
[33:22] somebody's been precious to you
[33:24] and you appreciate that friendship
[33:27] but oh what a friend
[33:29] to having jesus
[33:32] we were driving coming into service and
[33:36] sister martha peterson said you and your
[33:38] wife looked like you were in a serious
[33:40] discussion as we drove by
[33:43] and i said where i was we were talking
[33:45] about the events of today
[33:48] and how everything seems so much closer
[33:50] than it has
[33:52] but we know who has it all under control
[33:55] so there doesn't have to be any fear or
[33:57] any nervousness about it
[33:58] in fact our hearts should be crying out
[34:00] even so come quickly lord jesus
[34:03] but as brother matt had us and he went
[34:05] to that
[34:07] chorus what a friend
[34:09] we have in jesus
[34:11] above anything or everything
[34:15] he is the one that cares most so
[34:17] we have a couple of requests to bring to
[34:19] your account and i kind of
[34:22] bring this up um
[34:24] a lady
[34:25] well known to our family
[34:28] on
[34:29] my side of family and my wife's her name
[34:31] is ali hauser
[34:34] she is
[34:36] she was a manager at pima college
[34:38] and a good percentage of the my wife's
[34:41] side of the family my girls worked under
[34:43] her
[34:44] over the years through pima college
[34:45] through the bookstores
[34:47] my daughter naomi worked for many years
[34:50] under her
[34:52] she had suffered breast cancer and and
[34:54] had gone through that some years back
[34:56] but just she's retired now and just
[34:58] recently she had mentioned to my
[34:59] daughter that she'd been in a lot of
[35:02] having a lot of stomach trouble
[35:04] they took her into to the hospital and
[35:08] naomi told her that they told her that
[35:11] just to go home
[35:12] enjoy the last couple weeks of her life
[35:15] is what the doctor said
[35:17] so we got to thinking about the time of
[35:19] getting to know them
[35:21] and this may be a little strange but
[35:24] i'll share it
[35:25] [Music]
[35:26] when naomi was just just a baby
[35:30] my wife's first cousin was shot and
[35:32] killed in a fight
[35:34] and of course that's that's hard to take
[35:38] and
[35:39] there were no grandchildren and he was
[35:41] the eldest of the family
[35:44] at the funeral there was a wreath that
[35:46] said love you daddy
[35:48] and nobody knew what was wrong
[35:51] well my wife's
[35:52] cousin and this lady ellie
[35:55] had a little child
[35:57] and the family didn't know
[35:59] and
[36:00] we might look at that as wrong
[36:03] but there was a little girl in the
[36:04] family from her family
[36:06] and the son who they grew up and we all
[36:08] got to know
[36:10] now you would look and say well yeah but
[36:12] i don't like how that happened but god
[36:13] had a reason for and why because i
[36:15] remember the comfort
[36:17] it was to my wife's uncle and aunt to
[36:20] have a child from there but now ellie
[36:22] they've given her that
[36:24] but i know a god
[36:26] and how many know that god
[36:28] how many know him personally he is more
[36:30] than able
[36:32] you know to raise one
[36:34] to take him up
[36:36] you could already be in the grave
[36:38] and he can call you out
[36:40] so we just remember that family it
[36:42] affects my wife's side the family and
[36:44] the houser family and a lot of the
[36:46] workers from pima college
[36:48] and
[36:50] there's also another young man that
[36:51] requested prayer
[36:53] in a situation that he has and we won't
[36:55] mention the names or anything but he was
[36:57] on my heart last night
[36:59] and this morning somebody approached me
[37:01] he said remember this young man
[37:04] so god knows the need there and if he'll
[37:06] stand with me
[37:09] you have a need
[37:12] we always have something lord
[37:14] even if i can't put it in words i'll
[37:16] raise my hand lord because i need you
[37:18] need you more than ever before lord we
[37:21] we come
[37:23] not as a hope looking to maybe a
[37:25] a man-made god a god of our own
[37:27] imagination a god of our our how we
[37:30] would like a god but to you the living
[37:32] god
[37:33] and we place all our cares upon you all
[37:35] our troubles
[37:37] lord even job said man is but a short
[37:40] time and full of troubles lord
[37:42] and sometimes they seem to overtake us
[37:44] but our hope is built on nothing less
[37:46] than jesus christ and his righteousness
[37:50] and what a friend we have in jesus you
[37:52] see every hand raised
[37:54] every heart here lord
[37:56] remembering the hauser family and all
[37:58] those affected on both sides lord
[38:01] for comfort for strength
[38:03] lord even for a miracle today lord i
[38:05] wonder they would have to say only god
[38:07] could do this lord
[38:09] this young man in need of prayer for a
[38:10] decision that he has to make
[38:13] lord we ask for mercy
[38:14] and leadership in his life today lord
[38:17] and each hand raised lord would you meet
[38:19] with him lord for he ask it in jesus
[38:21] christ's name
[38:23] amen
[38:24] oh heal
[38:26] me o lord
[38:30] and i
[38:31] will
[38:32] be
[38:35] saving
[38:37] and i will be saved
[38:44] heal me o lord
[38:48] and i
[38:49] will be
[38:53] for you
[38:55] the
[38:56] one i pray
[39:00] [Music]
[39:02] you
[39:03] are
[39:04] the one
[39:06] i just think he has agreed to do that so
[39:09] that's looking at those plans and then
[39:12] brother jordan sent me a whatsapp early
[39:14] this morning and
[39:17] about having another prayer meeting like
[39:19] we did
[39:20] thursday friday saturday from 6 to 8
[39:23] p.m and it's something that we had
[39:25] talked about we just hadn't set it up so
[39:28] the 18th of august through the 20th of
[39:30] august
[39:31] thursday
[39:32] friday saturday from 6 to 8 the church
[39:34] will be open for prayer like we did last
[39:37] time you come and pray
[39:39] and then you leave and you're done and
[39:40] we'll have the church open
[39:42] and then having on the sunday
[39:45] the next sunday
[39:48] having communion and and washington
[39:50] service
[39:51] something we've not done for a while and
[39:53] folks have been asking so
[39:55] let's plan on that if we would could
[39:57] and just see what the lord would have
[39:59] for us and then
[40:01] just a a reminder we're still working on
[40:03] the the details of september the fourth
[40:06] the first sunday of september
[40:08] a lot of the folks will be on out of
[40:09] town
[40:11] with the wedding of brother enoch
[40:13] peterson
[40:15] so we're still looking whether that
[40:16] service will be canceled or will we be
[40:18] able to
[40:19] all the musicians song leaders and sound
[40:21] will be gone basically
[40:23] so we're just looking we haven't
[40:25] officially canceled that but we're
[40:27] looking at that possibility so those are
[40:29] some of the things coming up for the
[40:30] month of august
[40:34] but god is good
[40:36] brother dan mentioned talking with him a
[40:38] little bit and you ministers know how
[40:40] the middle of the night you wake up and
[40:41] you wonder is that what i should be
[40:43] ministering is that what i should be
[40:45] doing
[40:46] and i did something i don't do often on
[40:48] a saturday late afternoon as i took a
[40:51] nap because i want to be able to sleep
[40:53] through the night and i was about five
[40:55] o'clock
[40:56] i woke up at one o'clock in the morning
[40:58] i don't think i've ever taken such a
[41:00] short nap
[41:01] i mean long nap
[41:02] but when i woke up brother dan brother
[41:04] ohio came on my heart
[41:06] i said i don't know if they're awake at
[41:08] this time lord but would you just settle
[41:10] in their heart that it's okay
[41:12] he told me that's about where he was
[41:14] wondering lord is this
[41:16] but you know that's a call in a sermon
[41:19] of god's heart is lord what will help
[41:20] the people
[41:21] what would be good for the church
[41:24] you know and
[41:24] and so when you know we're going to have
[41:26] a wednesday night service a sunday
[41:28] service
[41:29] if you wake up at 3 o'clock in the
[41:30] morning say lord remember the minister
[41:33] remember the brothers
[41:34] because sometimes they're still awake at
[41:36] that time asking lord is this is this
[41:38] what you want so
[41:39] trusting that the lord has something for
[41:41] us how many believe that
[41:43] lord and i'm willing to receive what you
[41:45] have for me let's stand now
[41:48] amen
[41:51] amazing grace how sweet the sound
[41:55] brother branham said there's nothing
[41:56] like the grace of god he said
[41:59] when you get over the other side you'll
[42:00] find me over there still singing amazing
[42:02] grace how sweet the sound

[42:26] once was lost
[42:30] but now
[42:32] i'm found
[42:34] i was blind
[42:36] but now

[43:31] like seeing some of these empty seats
[43:33] filled
[43:35] let's turn to ezekiel chapter 36.
[43:45] i've been
[43:46] been traveling a little bit again
[43:48] but aaron
[43:50] and the brothers made the announcement
[43:51] last week where aaron had something on
[43:53] his heart to preach on sunday morning
[43:55] and then
[43:56] there was a testimony service on sunday
[43:59] night and i accepted an invitation to go
[44:02] up to phoenix and minister brother
[44:04] mcgary's church
[44:05] over the weekend and
[44:07] it was it was a nice service
[44:10] but i i feel bad that i missed the
[44:12] testimony service but i went back and i
[44:14] watched it
[44:15] ezekiel chapter 36
[44:20] and i will sanctify my great name
[44:23] which was profaned among the heathen
[44:26] and friends that mean that word heathen
[44:29] it's it's also translated as nations
[44:31] outside of israel it doesn't necessarily
[44:33] mean idolaters it just means those that
[44:36] are outside
[44:38] of israel and outside the jewish race
[44:42] which ye have profaned in the midst of
[44:44] them and heathen shall know that i am
[44:46] the lord saith the lord god when i shall
[44:49] be sanctified in you before their eyes
[44:54] for i will take from among the heathen
[44:57] and gather you out of all countries and
[44:59] will bring you into your own land
[45:02] then i will sprinkle clean water upon
[45:05] you
[45:06] and you shall be clean
[45:08] from all your filthiness and from all
[45:10] your idols while i cleanse you
[45:12] a new heart also will i give you
[45:16] and a new spirit will i put within you
[45:19] and i will take away the stony heart out
[45:22] of your flesh
[45:23] and i will give you a heart of flesh
[45:27] and i will put my spirit within you and
[45:29] cause you to walk in my statutes and ye
[45:32] shall keep my judgments and do them
[45:34] and ye shall dwell in the land that i
[45:36] gave to your fathers and you shall be my
[45:38] people and i will be your god
[45:41] i will also
[45:43] save you from all your uncleanness
[45:46] and i will call for the corn and will
[45:48] increase it and will lay no famine upon
[45:50] you and i will multiply the fruit of the
[45:52] tree and increase
[45:54] of the field and the increase of the
[45:55] field that ye shall receive no more
[45:57] reproach of famine among the heathen
[46:00] then shall
[46:01] you remember your own evil ways
[46:04] and your doings that were not good
[46:07] and shall loathe yourselves in your own
[46:10] sight for your iniquities and for your
[46:12] abominations
[46:13] not for your sake do i do this saith the
[46:16] lord god
[46:17] be it known unto you
[46:19] be ashamed and confounded for your own
[46:21] ways o house of israel
[46:23] thus saith the lord god
[46:25] in the day
[46:26] that i shall have cleansed you from all
[46:28] your iniquities
[46:30] i will also cause you to dwell in the
[46:32] cities and the wastes shall be builded
[46:34] and the desolate
[46:36] shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate
[46:39] in the sight of
[46:40] of all that passed by
[46:43] and they shall say this land was
[46:45] desolate
[46:46] it has become like the garden of eden
[46:49] and the waste and the desolate and the
[46:50] ruined cities are become fenced and are
[46:52] inhabited
[46:54] then the heathen that are left round
[46:56] about you shall know that i the lord
[46:59] build the ruined places
[47:01] and plant that which was desolate i the
[47:04] lord have spoken and i will do it
[47:10] friends no matter how bad you've sinned

[52:34] god bless you
[52:36] um
[52:37] you know the paul said this he said
[52:40] he said christ gave himself for the
[52:41] church
[52:42] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[52:44] with the washing of the water of the
[52:47] word
[52:48] and i you know the it's been raining
[52:50] lately the monsoons and we've had a good
[52:53] monsoon like we had last year and i
[52:55] always look at the desert in june
[52:58] and in early july and it just looks so
[53:01] dead
[53:02] you know i look out there and the plants
[53:04] are dried up and they're shriveled and
[53:06] there's been such a drought
[53:08] in the southwest and and then you put a
[53:11] little bit of water
[53:12] to that desert
[53:14] and man oh man it greens up those
[53:17] cactuses swell up the flowers start
[53:19] coming out and everything starts looking
[53:22] like it's alive and that's how a
[53:24] christian is
[53:25] we can go without water for a long time
[53:28] we can separate ourselves but the lord
[53:31] starts putting that water on us
[53:33] and and you see that just start to bloom
[53:37] out
[53:38] i was listening to the rain last night i
[53:40] was up all night i couldn't couldn't
[53:42] sleep and and that rain was coming down
[53:44] and i was thinking those cactuses are
[53:46] just swelling and and the lord's just
[53:48] blessing
[53:50] his his desert and his plants and and
[53:52] he's also blessing his
[53:54] people i i had it on my heart
[53:59] really strong to preach on the book of
[54:01] malachi
[54:02] it
[54:03] it was something that i've been wanting
[54:05] to preach for a long time my wife can
[54:07] testify to that i keep saying that i'm
[54:09] going to preach on this and and i had
[54:11] everything ready and and
[54:14] i sat back in my chair brother aaron on
[54:16] friday night
[54:18] and i had a sermon ready and i was
[54:20] studying and i thought wow usually i'm
[54:22] late
[54:23] late saturday night
[54:25] preparing for my service
[54:27] preparing for my sermon and
[54:29] and i just felt good i woke up the next
[54:31] morning and i had this book of malachi
[54:34] on my heart and i just couldn't wait
[54:37] couldn't wait to preach about it to the
[54:39] church and everything that's in that
[54:40] book it's so deep and it it just it ends
[54:44] the old testament and the old testament
[54:46] just builds and builds and builds to
[54:48] this capstone and it talks about that
[54:51] there would be a messenger come
[54:53] and introduce the lord jesus and i
[54:55] couldn't wait to to um
[54:57] preach on it and stephanie i was walking
[54:59] on on saturday and
[55:02] and
[55:03] we were talking just rejoicing over the
[55:05] word and rejoicing over the lord jesus
[55:07] and
[55:08] and something told me
[55:11] don't don't preach on it
[55:13] you know preach on salvation again
[55:17] and you know friends it's so hard it's
[55:20] it's so hard to know what the lord wants
[55:23] you know he's he's he's there and we
[55:25] think oh just ask the lord it's not that
[55:28] easy
[55:29] and especially when you stand in this
[55:31] hallowed ground right here i never want
[55:34] to make a mistake i never want to say
[55:36] something that's wrong and i may say
[55:38] something that's completely right but it
[55:41] may be out of time
[55:42] it may be not the right time to say it
[55:45] and yeah a minister has to be so careful
[55:49] you
[55:49] things come to you and it says oh that
[55:51] sounds good
[55:53] and it gets you excited and and you want
[55:55] to you want to preach about it you may
[55:57] you may hear somebody else minister
[55:59] about it or
[56:01] whatever it might be
[56:02] and then there's no anointing there
[56:06] and it just fails
[56:08] and you look back and you say lord how
[56:10] did i how did i mess that one up
[56:13] and it's because it sounded good and you
[56:16] thought oh this will this will be good
[56:19] and you didn't consult the lord enough
[56:22] about it
[56:23] we have to be so careful of that even
[56:25] though it could be 100 right
[56:28] it could be at the wrong time to bring
[56:30] it
[56:31] and that's how i felt about ministering
[56:33] on
[56:35] on this book of malachi
[56:37] and
[56:38] felt like
[56:39] no
[56:41] he wanted me to talk
[56:43] again about salvation and again about
[56:45] the lord jesus i spoke
[56:48] last time
[56:51] about
[56:52] the
[56:53] hebrews and how they came out of egypt
[56:56] and
[56:57] they went up to caitis barnea and they
[56:59] failed there then 40 years later they
[57:01] went over the jordan and they conquered
[57:03] all the land and now caleb he faced
[57:06] these giants and he conquered them
[57:09] because he had god with him and he put
[57:11] his trust in god and then i brought it
[57:14] down to matthew chapter five jesus's
[57:17] first public sermon
[57:19] and how jesus got the people together on
[57:22] the mountain he already had he already
[57:24] had notoriety he had already been
[57:25] healing the sick and he had been
[57:27] preaching from house to house but this
[57:29] was the first public sermon
[57:32] and he brought things that no one had
[57:35] really ever heard
[57:38] and
[57:39] he raised
[57:40] the bar
[57:43] and and he said that that these things
[57:45] that i preach that's something like
[57:48] like marriage
[57:50] before in the ten commandments it says
[57:51] if you commit adultery
[57:55] then you're in danger of hell
[57:58] but jesus raised it up hi he says if you
[58:01] just want if you just desire
[58:05] someone besides your spouse
[58:07] you're in danger of hell
[58:09] and he raised this bar up and he really
[58:13] he hit he hit the ministers
[58:17] and
[58:20] these battles and i brought these
[58:22] battles out that we have these battles
[58:24] are in our minds friends
[58:26] and i said that caleb had this battle of
[58:29] flesh and blood
[58:30] where he saw these giants he pulled his
[58:32] sword they went to battle and they beat
[58:34] them with god's help
[58:36] but
[58:37] today
[58:38] we have it much more difficult than
[58:40] caleb had
[58:42] because our battles these giants that
[58:43] come before us are in our minds
[58:47] and they're constantly working at us
[58:49] there's two things constantly pulling us
[58:51] there's god pulling at us and satan
[58:52] pulling us all the time
[58:54] and it's our choice which way that we go
[58:58] in ephesians 6 12 paul said this he said
[59:00] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[59:01] blood but against principalities against
[59:04] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[59:06] this world against spiritual wickedness
[59:08] in high places
[59:12] the stakes were higher the stakes are
[59:15] raised and the lord jesus preached this
[59:18] sermon
[59:19] on the mountain
[59:21] and
[59:23] at the end of his sermon he says be ye
[59:25] perfect even as your father which is in
[59:27] heaven
[59:28] is perfect in matthew chapter 7 he says
[59:31] this he says enter in enter ye in at the
[59:33] straight gate for wide is the gate and
[59:35] broad is the way that leadeth to
[59:36] destruction and many there will be that
[59:39] go in there at
[59:41] because strait is the gate and narrow is
[59:44] the way
[59:45] which leadeth unto life and few there
[59:48] will be find it
[59:51] what a statement
[59:53] in in these these battles that we fight
[59:57] as i said last time the stakes are very
[59:59] very high
[1:00:01] matthew
[1:00:02] chapter 5
[1:00:04] let's review some of the things that our
[1:00:06] lord jesus said
[1:00:08] he said verse 20 thank you my brother
[1:00:11] for i say unto you that accept your
[1:00:13] righteousness shall exceed the
[1:00:14] righteousness of the scribes and
[1:00:15] pharisees ye shall in no case enter into
[1:00:18] the kingdom of heaven
[1:00:19] ye have heard that it was said of them
[1:00:21] of old time thou shalt not kill
[1:00:24] and whosoever shall kill shall be in
[1:00:25] danger of the judgment but i say unto
[1:00:28] you that whosoever is angry with his
[1:00:29] brother without a cause
[1:00:31] shall be in danger of judgment and
[1:00:33] whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa
[1:00:37] shall be in danger of the counsel
[1:00:39] but whosoever shall say thou fool shall
[1:00:42] be in danger of hell fire that word
[1:00:44] raqqa
[1:00:46] means you're calling somebody name
[1:00:47] you're calling him a fool or you're
[1:00:48] calling him a worthless person or an
[1:00:51] insult
[1:00:53] so friends
[1:00:54] if we just say an insulting word
[1:00:58] we put ourselves in danger of hell
[1:01:02] it's a serious situation you can see how
[1:01:04] jesus said few there will be that find
[1:01:06] it but thank god that he gave us this
[1:01:09] word that we can refer back to this and
[1:01:12] do our best to live to live this life we
[1:01:16] were after
[1:01:17] last sunday
[1:01:20] i ministered to brother aaron mcgarry's
[1:01:22] church and then we went up to the
[1:01:24] mountains the white mountains for a few
[1:01:26] days of rest and we got an airbnb up
[1:01:28] there and on the way up we went into
[1:01:31] payson and there's a walmart and payson
[1:01:34] so we go in there
[1:01:36] and
[1:01:36] we're going and shopping around me and
[1:01:38] stephanie and daniel we're shopping
[1:01:40] around looking um for the food that we
[1:01:42] were gonna bring with us and uh there
[1:01:44] was this fella with um a turnaround
[1:01:46] collar
[1:01:48] and uh he was in the produce section and
[1:01:50] and we were there and i i wanted to
[1:01:54] make conversation with him
[1:01:56] and i i asked him i said to preach this
[1:01:58] morning
[1:02:00] and uh because it was sunday or sunday
[1:02:02] afternoon
[1:02:03] he said
[1:02:05] he says yeah i did
[1:02:07] and uh i said so did i
[1:02:11] and um you know i was in jeans and a
[1:02:13] t-shirt and you know it changed when we
[1:02:16] were going up there sunday
[1:02:18] late afternoon early evening
[1:02:20] and um
[1:02:23] i i talked to him for a moment and um
[1:02:27] i said
[1:02:29] he says
[1:02:30] i am episcopalian
[1:02:33] and i thought that's good and he says uh
[1:02:35] he says we're the third largest group in
[1:02:37] the world 90 million people
[1:02:41] and i said i said goodie says where'd
[1:02:42] you preach this morning i said well i
[1:02:44] said at a church in glendale
[1:02:47] um and he said
[1:02:49] he said oh that's good he said who you
[1:02:50] affiliated with and i said oh it was
[1:02:52] just a non-denominational christian
[1:02:54] church
[1:02:55] and he said he says no no no he says i
[1:02:58] mean i mean who are you affiliated with
[1:03:00] and then he goes into his episcopalian
[1:03:02] thing and kind of looking down at me
[1:03:05] speaking a little bit insulting
[1:03:07] and my sermon came back to my mind
[1:03:09] when i was preaching here
[1:03:11] and i was saying
[1:03:14] don't say raqqa don't say raka don't say
[1:03:17] raka
[1:03:19] and and he was he was talking about you
[1:03:22] know how good he was and and how great
[1:03:24] his church was and and you know we're
[1:03:26] the third largest and and i was again i
[1:03:28] was singing don't think don't say raqqa
[1:03:30] don't think raqqa don't think raqqa and
[1:03:32] he said and he said you know we're the
[1:03:34] third largest and and what i wanted to
[1:03:36] say is well that's good that's a bronze
[1:03:37] medal i'm too bad you couldn't get the
[1:03:39] goal maybe you'll be promoted to
[1:03:40] catholic
[1:03:41] one day you know but i didn't say it but
[1:03:44] i wanted to say it but my my
[1:03:47] sermon was back at me and then
[1:03:50] we we said our goodbyes and it wasn't
[1:03:52] the most cordial thing and then
[1:03:54] stephanie was there and she was like wow
[1:03:56] that was really rude and i was thinking
[1:03:59] don't say raqqa don't say raqqa don't
[1:04:01] think raqqa don't think
[1:04:04] and i didn't
[1:04:05] and i didn't say say it to my wife and
[1:04:07] thank god that i didn't and and you know
[1:04:10] i don't know that man
[1:04:12] he's he's a servant of the lord has
[1:04:14] dedicated his heart his life
[1:04:17] to preaching the gospel and i don't know
[1:04:19] him we got off on the wrong foot but i'm
[1:04:22] glad that i didn't even though my nature
[1:04:24] wanted to i'm glad that i didn't have
[1:04:27] that
[1:04:28] more spirited conversation with him
[1:04:32] matthew again
[1:04:34] chapter five let's go to verse 29 and if
[1:04:36] thy right eye offend thee
[1:04:38] offend means causes you to sin
[1:04:41] pluck it out and cast it from me for it
[1:04:43] is profitable for thee that one of thy
[1:04:45] members should perish and not that thy
[1:04:47] whole body should be cast into hell
[1:04:50] and if thy right hand offended me cut it
[1:04:52] off
[1:04:53] and cast it from thee for it is
[1:04:55] profitable for thee that one of thy
[1:04:57] members should perish and not that thy
[1:04:59] whole body should be cast to hell let's
[1:05:01] skip to verse 44
[1:05:03] but i say unto you love your enemies
[1:05:06] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:05:08] them that hate you
[1:05:10] and pray for them which despise fully
[1:05:12] use you and persecute you that ye may be
[1:05:15] the children of your father which is in
[1:05:17] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[1:05:19] the evil and the good
[1:05:21] and sinneth reign on the just and on the
[1:05:23] unjust for if ye love them which love
[1:05:26] you what reward have you
[1:05:28] do not even the publicans the same and
[1:05:31] if you salute your brethren only
[1:05:34] what do ye more than the others do not
[1:05:37] even republicans so
[1:05:39] be ye perfect
[1:05:41] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:05:44] is perfect
[1:05:46] notice how high jesus sets that bar and
[1:05:50] it's something that as christians as a
[1:05:52] as i said in the in the last
[1:05:55] sermon that i preached
[1:05:57] aim small
[1:05:58] and miss small
[1:06:00] aim for perfection do everything that
[1:06:04] you can to attain what our lord jesus
[1:06:08] has set before us
[1:06:10] and then our mistakes won't take us too
[1:06:13] far off the way
[1:06:15] there's no way as paul said all of sin
[1:06:18] and come short of the glory of god
[1:06:19] there's no way that we can be perfect
[1:06:21] but we should try for that perfection
[1:06:25] but the blood of jesus christ
[1:06:27] does make us perfect
[1:06:30] and that is the whole
[1:06:32] christianity the whole story of
[1:06:34] christianity my brother
[1:06:37] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:06:41] he's the mystery through the old
[1:06:42] testament and he is the one that can
[1:06:45] make us perfect
[1:06:47] i have a uh
[1:06:48] my cousin ronald evans
[1:06:51] uh he passed away from covet about a
[1:06:53] year ago
[1:06:54] he's got a son
[1:06:56] and uh the kids little how old is luke
[1:06:58] is he like 10 daniel he's like 10 years
[1:07:01] old and i'll tell you what i don't know
[1:07:03] if i've ever seen a cuter kid than that
[1:07:05] kid was when he was little he's built
[1:07:07] like a cinderblock
[1:07:09] you know and he's just this
[1:07:11] big kid and big old teeth and big old
[1:07:13] smile about as cute as you can be and a
[1:07:16] few years ago we had we had what's
[1:07:18] called creations in jeffersonville we
[1:07:20] had this
[1:07:21] creations class it's like a sunday
[1:07:23] school class and what they did in class
[1:07:26] is they made a little box
[1:07:29] and this box had
[1:07:31] a a red filter over the top of it
[1:07:35] so when when you would put that red
[1:07:37] filter over the top of it you couldn't
[1:07:40] see anything that was underneath it
[1:07:43] and they were teaching the kids how that
[1:07:46] this red filter over the top it it was
[1:07:50] like the blood of jesus
[1:07:52] and it
[1:07:53] you couldn't jesus god couldn't see the
[1:07:55] sins because of this
[1:07:57] so this little kid luke he was
[1:07:59] he got crossed with his mom
[1:08:02] and uh he got in trouble
[1:08:04] and he had to go sit in his chair
[1:08:07] that that was the punishment and the
[1:08:09] little guy you know he was he's mad i
[1:08:11] think i think it was candy i think he
[1:08:12] wasn't allowed to have candy and he
[1:08:14] wanted the candy and he went and he sat
[1:08:16] down in his chair and he was he was mad
[1:08:18] he was upset
[1:08:20] that he had that mom stuck him in this
[1:08:22] chair
[1:08:23] and my cousin ronald
[1:08:25] he uh he peeked in the door
[1:08:28] and he was looking at him the kids was
[1:08:30] pouting
[1:08:31] there and he gets up
[1:08:33] and he goes to this
[1:08:34] box that he had made in sunday school
[1:08:38] with the red filter over the top of it
[1:08:40] symbolizing the blood of jesus christ
[1:08:42] and he opens the top of that box and he
[1:08:45] says
[1:08:45] mom is so stupid
[1:08:49] and then he closes it
[1:08:53] puts that under the blood he knew what
[1:08:55] he was doing but he stuck it right up
[1:08:57] underneath there even the even the kids
[1:08:59] understand they understand
[1:09:01] what the blood means now that's not how
[1:09:03] we're supposed to do it but he was like
[1:09:05] five years old at the time so
[1:09:08] but as sweet as you can be
[1:09:11] and yes
[1:09:12] that blood does cover our sins
[1:09:16] that matthew 5 48 says be
[1:09:18] perfect as your father which is in
[1:09:20] heaven is perfect
[1:09:22] another translation of that says you
[1:09:25] therefore must be perfect
[1:09:28] as your heavenly father is perfect
[1:09:32] and
[1:09:33] he he preaches this message on the mount
[1:09:37] and
[1:09:38] you see the prophetic
[1:09:41] nature of our lord jesus if you look in
[1:09:44] in the old testament you have these
[1:09:46] books they're called the books of the
[1:09:48] prophets i believe they start in isaiah
[1:09:50] and they go all the way through to the
[1:09:51] end to malachi and every single book
[1:09:54] most of them kind of do the same thing
[1:09:56] they kind of have the same order what
[1:09:58] they do is god will bring an indictment
[1:10:00] against the people and then he will
[1:10:01] bring encouragement
[1:10:03] and he'll say that but i have given you
[1:10:05] a way out but i have forgiven you and if
[1:10:08] you look at jesus's sermon on the mount
[1:10:11] that's how it is except jesus does it
[1:10:13] backwards
[1:10:15] than than what the prophets did he does
[1:10:17] it a little bit different what he does
[1:10:18] in matthew chapter 5 is he brings out
[1:10:22] first the encouragement
[1:10:24] and then
[1:10:26] he goes and he brings out what i
[1:10:28] ministered on last time which is this
[1:10:30] really high bar
[1:10:33] matthew chapter 5 verse 3
[1:10:37] the beatitudes
[1:10:39] jesus says this blessed are the poor in
[1:10:41] spirit
[1:10:42] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:10:44] blessed are they that mourn for they
[1:10:46] shall be comforted
[1:10:48] blessed are the meek
[1:10:50] for they shall inherit the earth
[1:10:52] blessed are they
[1:10:54] which do
[1:10:55] hunger and thirst
[1:10:57] after righteousness for they shall be
[1:10:59] filled
[1:11:01] that's the key statement friends
[1:11:03] that's the key
[1:11:05] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[1:11:08] for righteousness for the promises they
[1:11:11] shall be filled
[1:11:13] you know we look at who was there when
[1:11:16] jesus was preaching this and there were
[1:11:19] pharisees and sadducees there were there
[1:11:21] were all these different
[1:11:23] classes of people
[1:11:25] there were people that didn't just were
[1:11:28] coming to see what was going on what was
[1:11:30] the crowd
[1:11:31] there were there were the the minister
[1:11:33] group over here some of these more
[1:11:34] self-righteous ones
[1:11:36] and then
[1:11:37] there were sinners that were in this
[1:11:41] group that were repentant
[1:11:43] there were sinners that had pure hearts
[1:11:48] that knew that they had done wrong
[1:11:51] sinners
[1:11:52] like mary magdalene
[1:11:54] sinners like
[1:11:57] peter
[1:11:58] and these different ones they knew they
[1:12:00] had done wrong
[1:12:01] but they had a repentant heart they had
[1:12:03] a soft heart
[1:12:04] and these other ones these
[1:12:06] these pharisees and sadducees they had
[1:12:09] that cold
[1:12:10] and stony heart
[1:12:12] and when jesus
[1:12:14] preached this
[1:12:16] you know these words that he preached
[1:12:18] and the beatitudes you know they must
[1:12:20] have given him hope or her hope they
[1:12:23] must have brought hope to the people
[1:12:25] that you can be saved no matter what
[1:12:27] sins that you have
[1:12:29] i told the story
[1:12:31] some time ago and there's there's many
[1:12:33] here that probably weren't there on that
[1:12:36] day
[1:12:36] about an experiment that was done in the
[1:12:38] 1950s
[1:12:40] by a harvard university professor
[1:12:43] and what this harvard university
[1:12:45] professor did is he took
[1:12:49] a bunch
[1:12:50] of rats and these rats were domestic
[1:12:53] rats and these rats were wild rats and
[1:12:55] he took these rats
[1:12:57] and it was a bit of a morbid experiment
[1:12:59] i i
[1:13:00] admit it but he took these rats and he
[1:13:03] placed them in a bucket of water each of
[1:13:06] them
[1:13:07] and these rats swam around
[1:13:10] for a few minutes
[1:13:12] and some of them up to 15 minutes and
[1:13:15] after a few minutes each rat died
[1:13:20] and he said okay
[1:13:22] he said i'll do the next set so he takes
[1:13:25] the next
[1:13:26] set of poor little rats and he sticks
[1:13:28] them in the water and they start
[1:13:30] swimming around and after a few minutes
[1:13:33] they again start to sink
[1:13:36] and right before they drowned
[1:13:39] he picked them out
[1:13:42] and set them on on a towel and clean
[1:13:44] them up and let them get their composure
[1:13:46] back and then
[1:13:49] none of them would have lasted over 15
[1:13:51] minutes and then he takes them and he
[1:13:52] puts the ones that he took out back into
[1:13:55] the water
[1:13:58] and they started swimming and they
[1:14:00] started swimming and they continued to
[1:14:03] swim
[1:14:04] not
[1:14:05] for a few minutes
[1:14:07] but they swam
[1:14:09] for 60
[1:14:11] hours
[1:14:13] and he says this
[1:14:16] ricker
[1:14:17] richter
[1:14:18] recorded in his notes
[1:14:20] after elimination of hopelessness the
[1:14:23] rats do not die
[1:14:25] they had the hope that someone would
[1:14:28] grab them out
[1:14:30] of this water
[1:14:32] and save them before they had no hope
[1:14:35] but listen to the hope that jesus gives
[1:14:37] blessed are the merciful verse 7 for
[1:14:39] they shall obtain mercy
[1:14:41] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:14:43] shall see god
[1:14:45] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:14:47] shall be called the children of god
[1:14:48] blessed are they which pers are
[1:14:51] persecuted for righteousness sake for
[1:14:53] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:14:56] blessed are ye
[1:14:58] when men shall revile you
[1:15:01] and persecute you and say all manner of
[1:15:04] evil
[1:15:05] against you falsely
[1:15:07] for my sake that's the most difficult
[1:15:11] thing in the world today friends
[1:15:14] is when if you want to be
[1:15:16] an
[1:15:18] lgbtq or any other
[1:15:20] letter in the alphabet if you want to be
[1:15:23] that then people will lift you up and
[1:15:26] say oh he has courage or she has courage
[1:15:30] but why when i say i want to be a
[1:15:32] christian
[1:15:33] why do we get met with oh you're a bigot
[1:15:36] or or you or this or you're can you're
[1:15:41] cast out
[1:15:42] why are we met with that
[1:15:45] connie if we went to work
[1:15:47] and we we came out with some strange
[1:15:50] thing that we were
[1:15:52] we'd be accepted and patted on the back
[1:15:54] and say yeah you know go
[1:15:57] but because we're a christian
[1:15:59] it's something different
[1:16:01] we don't want that
[1:16:03] why is that
[1:16:04] it's because this world is against
[1:16:08] god's people this world is against the
[1:16:10] message of the hour
[1:16:12] it's against that
[1:16:15] and it wants it wants to promote
[1:16:17] standing up but by standing up with
[1:16:20] these other people you're actually
[1:16:21] conforming to their way of thinking
[1:16:25] in the christianity way you're not
[1:16:26] conforming
[1:16:28] christianity way you're following the
[1:16:29] lord jesus
[1:16:32] verse
[1:16:33] it says rejoice and be exceeding glad
[1:16:35] for great is your reward in heaven for
[1:16:37] so persecuted they the prophets which
[1:16:39] were before you you are the salt of the
[1:16:42] earth
[1:16:43] but if the salt has lost its savior
[1:16:46] wherewith shall it be salted it is
[1:16:48] thenceforth good for nothing but to be
[1:16:50] cast out and be trodden under the foot
[1:16:52] of men
[1:16:53] you know those that cook you can use
[1:16:55] spices or you can you can cook your food
[1:16:57] in oil and if the spices are rancid if
[1:16:59] the oil is rancid it ruins the flavor of
[1:17:02] the food
[1:17:04] and jesus is saying that he's saying
[1:17:06] that if you're a christian
[1:17:08] then love should always flow from you
[1:17:11] but never lose that soft heart never
[1:17:15] become that stony heart
[1:17:18] and he says this you are the light of
[1:17:19] the world
[1:17:20] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[1:17:23] hid
[1:17:25] i i think about as i was reading that
[1:17:27] scripture last
[1:17:28] night i was thinking about
[1:17:31] this woman
[1:17:33] that was a vile sinner
[1:17:36] she
[1:17:37] had as the bible says that she had had
[1:17:41] five different husbands married and
[1:17:43] divorced and married and divorced and
[1:17:45] and back and forth and then she was
[1:17:48] shacking up with someone that wasn't
[1:17:50] even her husband was just some other
[1:17:51] dude that she was with
[1:17:54] and she
[1:17:55] came to this well she wasn't even the
[1:17:58] same race as jesus was
[1:18:01] and she comes to this well
[1:18:04] and jesus asks her he said he says bring
[1:18:07] me a drink
[1:18:10] and she looks at him and she says listen
[1:18:11] there's segregation
[1:18:14] here
[1:18:15] and we don't we don't fellowship with
[1:18:16] one another because we're of different
[1:18:18] races look at how jesus crosses those
[1:18:20] racial boundaries even
[1:18:22] and he says and jesus
[1:18:25] looks back at her
[1:18:27] and he says
[1:18:28] this is a
[1:18:30] saint john chapter 4
[1:18:33] he said
[1:18:34] if you knew who you were talking to
[1:18:38] he said then you would ask me
[1:18:40] for a drink
[1:18:42] and he said
[1:18:45] he said and i and
[1:18:47] he didn't say he he didn't say i but he
[1:18:49] said if you knew who you were talking to
[1:18:51] you would ask him for a drink and he
[1:18:54] would give you
[1:18:56] what a drink of living water
[1:19:00] and it must have struck something in
[1:19:01] this lady
[1:19:03] you know gave her gave her a little bit
[1:19:04] of hope
[1:19:05] saint john chapter 4 verse 13 it says
[1:19:08] this
[1:19:10] i'm sorry and she responded she said
[1:19:12] she's she says she's there with her her
[1:19:14] bucket and she's going to send it down
[1:19:16] the well and
[1:19:18] he says you would ask me for a drink and
[1:19:20] she said sir you don't even have a
[1:19:21] bucket to send down the well
[1:19:24] and he says this
[1:19:26] he said whosoever drinketh of this water
[1:19:28] shall thirst again pointed at the well
[1:19:30] there but whosoever shall drinketh the
[1:19:33] water that i shall give him shall never
[1:19:34] thirst
[1:19:35] but the water i shall give him
[1:19:38] shall be a be in him a well of water
[1:19:41] springing up to everlasting life
[1:19:45] and the woman saith unto him sir
[1:19:47] give me this water that i thirst not
[1:19:51] neither come here to draw
[1:19:54] and then jesus goes on
[1:19:56] to solidify
[1:19:58] this that he is a prophet
[1:20:01] and he he tells her about her
[1:20:04] living wrong
[1:20:07] and then
[1:20:08] this woman she drops her water pot
[1:20:12] and she runs back
[1:20:14] to her city
[1:20:17] and she starts telling everyone
[1:20:20] about this lord jesus
[1:20:22] she starts
[1:20:23] witnessing to everybody look what the
[1:20:26] lord has done look at look who this man
[1:20:28] told me who i am he told me everything
[1:20:30] about me is this not the messiah
[1:20:34] look
[1:20:35] who
[1:20:36] god chose to represent him
[1:20:40] it was not the proud pharisees and
[1:20:44] sadducees
[1:20:45] it was this woman that was nothing that
[1:20:48] was wasn't even allowed to even
[1:20:50] fellowship with the the the virgin women
[1:20:53] that went out it was her that god chose
[1:20:56] and then she became this light of the
[1:20:59] world
[1:21:01] and she witnessed
[1:21:03] and she is the one that led how many
[1:21:05] people
[1:21:07] to the lord jesus but the main thing is
[1:21:09] she changed
[1:21:11] that moment that she met jesus her life
[1:21:15] changed
[1:21:17] and she became a light she became a
[1:21:20] witness
[1:21:22] back back to matthew chapter 5
[1:21:25] verse 15 it says neither do men light a
[1:21:27] candle and put it under a bushel
[1:21:30] but on a candlestick
[1:21:31] and it giveth life unto all that are in
[1:21:33] the house
[1:21:34] let your light so shine before men that
[1:21:37] they may see your good works and glorify
[1:21:39] your father which is in heaven
[1:21:42] how many people friends
[1:21:44] will come to the lord
[1:21:46] to if you show a change in your life
[1:21:51] all of our witness and everything that
[1:21:54] we say
[1:21:56] it doesn't mean anything
[1:21:59] unless
[1:22:00] we are producing a life
[1:22:02] and then when people see that then
[1:22:06] you'll see souls comes to the lord when
[1:22:08] i was working in the ministry in indiana
[1:22:12] i got a call from
[1:22:14] a man
[1:22:16] and he had
[1:22:17] been watching uh brother branham on
[1:22:20] youtube
[1:22:21] and he had listened to the sermon titled
[1:22:23] the token
[1:22:25] and
[1:22:26] he called and the receptionist he said
[1:22:29] i'm seeking the lord to the receptionist
[1:22:31] the receptionist
[1:22:32] called me and she said this man is
[1:22:34] seeking the lord would you like to talk
[1:22:35] to him i said sure

[1:22:38] i said this bro daniel evans
[1:22:40] she or he said
[1:22:42] i need the token.
[1:22:45] he said i need the holy spirit
[1:22:49] we started talking a little bit more and
[1:22:51] he asked me
[1:22:53] he said
[1:22:54] how do i receive
[1:22:57] this holy spirit that i've heard about
[1:23:00] and i i
[1:23:02] told him i said well if we go back in
[1:23:04] the book of acts peter had just given
[1:23:07] this tremendous sermon on the lord jesus
[1:23:10] and talking about how christ died for
[1:23:13] our sins and then the people it says
[1:23:15] they were cut in their hearts
[1:23:18] and then they came to peter and they
[1:23:21] said lord what should we do or peter
[1:23:24] what should we do
[1:23:26] and then peter said those mighty words
[1:23:28] in acts chapter
[1:23:30] chapter 2 verse 38 he said repent
[1:23:33] every one of you
[1:23:36] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:23:39] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:23:42] and you shall
[1:23:43] receive that gift that i've been talking
[1:23:45] about
[1:23:46] you shall receive that token
[1:23:49] so this this man his name's adam
[1:23:51] this man
[1:23:52] he started
[1:23:54] praying and and he asked me he says i
[1:23:56] need to be baptized and he was in
[1:23:58] pennsylvania i called him minister
[1:23:59] brother that i know in pennsylvania
[1:24:01] baptized him in the name of the lord
[1:24:02] jesus and his life changed he lived a
[1:24:06] rough life
[1:24:07] of crime and drugs and and and just
[1:24:11] really bad life he was about my age
[1:24:15] and he
[1:24:17] had a friend named joey
[1:24:20] and this friend saw the change in adam's
[1:24:23] life
[1:24:24] and he said i want to be i want what you
[1:24:28] have just joey's life the change
[1:24:33] he became the light of the world this
[1:24:36] sinner man

[1:24:39] joey
[1:24:40] had committed some serious crimes he got
[1:24:43] into organized crime
[1:24:46] and
[1:24:47] he was in deep trouble trouble they had
[1:24:49] a sting operation i think there were i
[1:24:52] think it was drugs or
[1:24:54] i think there were some murders involved
[1:24:56] but they had arrested 41
[1:24:59] people
[1:25:01] in this operation
[1:25:03] joey was one of them
[1:25:05] so

[1:25:09] and he says
[1:25:11] i don't know what to do i'm a christian
[1:25:13] now
[1:25:14] and he says i did these things
[1:25:17] he said i'm guilty
[1:25:19] he says what do i do
[1:25:21] adam says well he says we pray
[1:25:25] adam called me up
[1:25:27] and he says
[1:25:28] let's pray for my friend joe and he told
[1:25:30] me the whole situation
[1:25:33] i said okay and we prayed and brother
[1:25:36] adam kept on his way
[1:25:38] of serving the lord
[1:25:41] and he called me i don't know it was a
[1:25:43] year later
[1:25:45] whatever it was and
[1:25:46] he told me he said
[1:25:48] remember my friend joey
[1:25:51] and i said yeah he says remember the
[1:25:53] sting operation and and and them being
[1:25:56] uh
[1:25:57] being tried for this and and being going
[1:25:59] to go to prison i said yeah
[1:26:01] he said there were 41 people indicted
[1:26:05] he said 40 went to prison
[1:26:10] and joey said i don't know how it
[1:26:12] happened
[1:26:13] he said the judge had mercy on me
[1:26:15] threw it out he said i was guilty
[1:26:18] but it was because of adam's witness
[1:26:21] of what he did
[1:26:23] i look at uh
[1:26:25] look at my son there daniel
[1:26:28] and
[1:26:29] you know i pick on a pick on him
[1:26:31] sometimes and but
[1:26:33] he made me proud the other day he makes
[1:26:35] me proud every day but he was
[1:26:38] he was talking to some believers in
[1:26:40] jeffersonville
[1:26:42] and he was talking with a brother that's
[1:26:44] about my age that that has children that
[1:26:47] have gone wayward and daniel was was
[1:26:50] telling him that that they need jesus
[1:26:52] they need to be in church they that they
[1:26:55] can be forgiven for these things they
[1:26:56] can come back
[1:26:59] and
[1:27:00] the brother was was listening to him and
[1:27:04] daniel after that daniel told me he said
[1:27:07] he said dad he said
[1:27:09] aya
[1:27:10] i didn't know why this brother's my
[1:27:11] elder why was i talking like that and
[1:27:14] and the brother was teared up and the
[1:27:16] things that daniel were saying was was
[1:27:18] really an encouragement to him but what
[1:27:20] daniel didn't know at the time
[1:27:23] that there was a young lady
[1:27:25] listening
[1:27:26] to what he said
[1:27:28] this young lady was a sinner she had
[1:27:32] long since
[1:27:34] gone into the world and had the scars
[1:27:37] of the world
[1:27:39] but she had a soft heart
[1:27:42] and as she was listening to daniel talk
[1:27:45] it was speaking to her heart about this
[1:27:49] lord jesus and about how i should be
[1:27:51] fellowshipping and about these things
[1:27:53] and
[1:27:54] daniel
[1:27:55] was kind to her
[1:27:58] while the other church folks
[1:28:01] weren't accepting of her
[1:28:04] they would cast her out say she's doing
[1:28:06] this this and this and this and they
[1:28:07] would turn their head from her but
[1:28:10] she had a desire to be right
[1:28:14] look at the difference between the
[1:28:16] pharisees and the sadducees over here
[1:28:18] and look at the difference between mary
[1:28:19] magdalene over here
[1:28:22] you could be standing over here with
[1:28:24] this cold stony heart living a life
[1:28:26] above reproach
[1:28:28] but then over here you have a sinner
[1:28:31] girl
[1:28:32] who was a prostitute mary magdalene
[1:28:35] and yet she was god's seed
[1:28:39] and these other ones were too good for
[1:28:41] it
[1:28:42] and here is this young lady this young
[1:28:44] lady gives her heart to the lord jesus
[1:28:48] that daniel was talking with
[1:28:50] and you know what she said
[1:28:51] she said daniel the difference is you
[1:28:53] were nice to me
[1:28:56] she said you cared
[1:28:58] everybody else just cast me out
[1:29:01] i thought amen
[1:29:02] what is a christian's job in this world
[1:29:06] a christian's job is to reach out to
[1:29:08] those and i look at some of those people
[1:29:11] and i think how much better are they
[1:29:12] than i am
[1:29:14] they may be a homeless person on the
[1:29:16] street they may be
[1:29:18] a sinner girl they whatever they may be
[1:29:21] i look at them and i say who in the
[1:29:23] bible do i want to be like
[1:29:26] i want to have that soft heart
[1:29:29] that these people had that that young
[1:29:30] lady had daniel i want that soft heart
[1:29:34] willing to take correction
[1:29:36] willing to move forward
[1:29:39] in this gospel
[1:29:41] let's go back to ezekiel
[1:29:46] ezekiel chapter 36
[1:29:50] what a tremendous message
[1:29:53] this is
[1:29:54] verse 23
[1:29:58] and i will sanctify my great name which
[1:30:00] is profaned among the heathen remember
[1:30:02] that heathen is just the people
[1:30:05] which ye have profaned in the midst of
[1:30:07] them and he then shall know that i am
[1:30:09] the lord saith the lord god when i shall
[1:30:12] be sanctified in you before
[1:30:16] their eyes
[1:30:19] they see the change in us
[1:30:22] and that means everything to them
[1:30:25] you are the light of the world
[1:30:28] don't let that candle go out friends
[1:30:31] for i will take you from among the
[1:30:33] heathen and gather you out of all
[1:30:34] countries and will bring you into your
[1:30:36] own land then i will sprinkle clean
[1:30:39] water upon you
[1:30:40] have refreshing water and you shall be
[1:30:43] clean from all your filthiness and from
[1:30:45] your idols i will cleanse you will i
[1:30:48] cleanse you
[1:30:49] don't worry about everything that you've
[1:30:50] done
[1:30:51] as jesus said these people would come to
[1:30:53] him he didn't tell him you're doing
[1:30:55] wrong
[1:30:56] he said don't do it again
[1:31:00] a new heart also
[1:31:03] will i give you
[1:31:05] and a new spirit will i put within you
[1:31:07] and i will take away the stony heart out
[1:31:09] of your flesh and i will give you a
[1:31:12] heart of flesh
[1:31:16] and i will put my spirit within you and
[1:31:18] cause you to walk in my statutes and you
[1:31:21] shall keep my judgments and do them
[1:31:28] i think about
[1:31:31] that blessed young lady
[1:31:34] prostitute
[1:31:37] that had heard about this man jesus
[1:31:39] christ
[1:31:41] and she had heard that this man is the
[1:31:44] messiah and this man can cleanse my sins
[1:31:48] living as bad of a life as you can live
[1:31:52] she went and she took the money
[1:31:55] we don't know exactly probably how she
[1:31:57] earned the money but it probably wasn't
[1:31:58] respectfully
[1:32:00] and she bought this expensive alabaster
[1:32:03] box
[1:32:05] of perfumed oil
[1:32:08] and she summed there was a
[1:32:10] gathering going on at a pharisee's house
[1:32:13] and she goes she sneaks in somehow and
[1:32:17] she sees there the son of god
[1:32:20] she recognized him
[1:32:22] the priest standing over here in the
[1:32:23] corner didn't
[1:32:26] she recognized him she goes up
[1:32:29] to him and she just can't contain
[1:32:31] herself
[1:32:33] i've sinned
[1:32:34] i'm a sinner
[1:32:36] and she falls down and she's washing his
[1:32:40] his feet she's kissing his feet the
[1:32:42] tears are coming out of her eyes
[1:32:44] washing jesus's feet
[1:32:47] and you know the story
[1:32:49] they didn't when they brought him into
[1:32:51] the house they didn't wash his feet they
[1:32:54] let him sit there with dirty feet
[1:32:56] and embarrassed
[1:32:58] him they wanted to put him down these
[1:33:00] priests
[1:33:01] but here comes this precious little lady
[1:33:06] and
[1:33:07] she's washing
[1:33:09] jesus's feet with her tears
[1:33:12] and she sees and she's probably
[1:33:13] embarrassed she takes her hair and she
[1:33:15] she cleans off the dirt off of his feet
[1:33:18] with her hair
[1:33:20] and these men that were standing there
[1:33:23] these ministers they're looking down and
[1:33:25] they're judging this poor little lady
[1:33:28] who was doing right
[1:33:30] and they were the sinners
[1:33:33] she was the saint
[1:33:35] they're judging this little lady
[1:33:38] and
[1:33:39] jesus perceived their thoughts
[1:33:44] and here she is god bless her loyal
[1:33:46] heart she didn't sin anymore after that
[1:33:50] jesus says this mark chapter 14 verse 9.
[1:33:54] i'll tell you what i can't wait to meet
[1:33:56] this young lady
[1:33:58] jesus says this
[1:34:01] verily i say unto you
[1:34:03] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[1:34:06] preached throughout all the world

[1:36:58] in your own sight for your iniquities
[1:37:01] and for your abominations

[1:37:09] how many of us look back at what we have
[1:37:11] done and we hate ourselves for doing
[1:37:14] them
[1:37:15] that's god's will
[1:37:17] that shows that soft
[1:37:19] tender heart
[1:37:21] look back and and see the sins that we
[1:37:24] we we did and we look at the blood of
[1:37:26] jesus christ and say it's washed clean
[1:37:30] but i hate myself for anything wrong
[1:37:32] i've ever done
[1:37:34] i hate it
[1:37:35] and sometimes it's hard to get over that
[1:37:39] but it's not bad
[1:37:41] that we hate that
[1:37:43] friends because we still did it
[1:37:46] don't ever forget your sins may be
[1:37:50] washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:37:53] but don't forget that you still did them
[1:37:57] and someone else paid the price for you

[1:38:28] say you sold the offering from the
[1:38:30] church or you did some some bad crime

[1:39:03] i will be the one that everyone hates
[1:39:06] i will be the one that is blamed for
[1:39:08] your sin
[1:39:10] when this man didn't do anything
[1:39:13] he was completely without sin
[1:39:16] and yet
[1:39:18] he took that sin for me
[1:39:21] i still sinned
[1:39:24] but by the grace of god
[1:39:27] jesus took that sin for me

[1:40:52] whatever wrong that we have ever done
[1:40:54] there's a there's a story
[1:40:56] that many of us
[1:40:59] are familiar with
[1:41:01] that uh about the magic flower
[1:41:04] and there's a man that he's out and and
[1:41:07] he's out in the wilderness
[1:41:09] and
[1:41:10] he
[1:41:11] finds
[1:41:12] this magic flower this fairy tale and
[1:41:15] this this
[1:41:16] flower speaks to him and says i'll give
[1:41:19] you
[1:41:20] whatever you want whatever you ask for
[1:41:23] and he picks up the flower
[1:41:26] and he says i want all the riches in the
[1:41:28] world
[1:41:30] he says i want to be rich
[1:41:33] the flower says okay so he
[1:41:36] the
[1:41:37] mountain that's there opens up
[1:41:39] a door opens up the man walks in and he
[1:41:42] sees gold and riches and jewels and
[1:41:45] everything inside of this mountain
[1:41:49] and he lays the flower down
[1:41:52] and he goes in
[1:41:54] and
[1:41:55] he
[1:41:56] takes some some some of the
[1:41:58] the gold and stuff and he goes to leave
[1:42:01] and the flower says don't forget the
[1:42:02] main thing
[1:42:04] don't forget the main thing
[1:42:07] and he says oh yeah he says maybe i
[1:42:09] should go get this other kind of goats
[1:42:10] he goes back inside and he gets this
[1:42:12] other stuff and he goes out and and the
[1:42:14] flower says don't forget the main thing
[1:42:20] and he says okay and he says he goes
[1:42:21] back and he looks and he says you know
[1:42:23] what i'll do is he says i'll take a rock
[1:42:26] sample
[1:42:27] of where i am right now
[1:42:29] so that i can get my way back to this
[1:42:31] place
[1:42:32] back to this treasure chest
[1:42:35] and he takes it
[1:42:37] and and he starts to leave and then the
[1:42:39] flower there
[1:42:41] says don't forget the main thing
[1:42:45] he says whatever and he leaves
[1:42:49] the door closes behind him
[1:42:51] all the riches
[1:42:53] close
[1:42:57] inside the mountain
[1:42:59] and the man had lost everything
[1:43:02] because he left the main thing
[1:43:06] he left that flower inside
[1:43:09] and it was gone forever
[1:43:13] and of course
[1:43:15] the flower is christ

[1:44:24] and love
[1:44:26] correction

[1:45:22] because you don't know who that sinner
[1:45:24] is
[1:45:25] and never cut them all the way out
[1:45:27] either

[1:47:17] mysterious man this melchizedek
[1:47:19] that was in the old testament he's this
[1:47:22] mysterious jehovah god that was there in
[1:47:26] the old testament he is the one

[1:47:38] place
