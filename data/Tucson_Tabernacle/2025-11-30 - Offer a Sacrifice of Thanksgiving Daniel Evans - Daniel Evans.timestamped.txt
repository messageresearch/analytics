[0:04] when peace like a river. Let's sing this
[0:06] this morning. It's a good atmosphere
[0:08] this morning. It's good to be in the
[0:11] house of God worshiping. We just want a
[0:13] nice godly atmosphere. Want the Holy
[0:16] Spirit to be here as brother Daniel gets
[0:18] ready to come out and bring the word to
[0:19] us this morning.
[0:21] When peace
[0:24] like a river [singing]
[0:29] attendeth
[0:32] my way.
[0:36] When sorrows [singing]
[0:39] like sea
[0:41] billows,
[0:48] whatever
[0:50] [music and singing]
[0:52] my heart,
[0:54] thou hast taught
[0:57] me [music]
[0:58] to say.
[1:01] It [singing]
[1:02] is well. [music]
[1:04] It is well
[1:07] with
[1:09] my [music and singing] soul. Verse two.
[1:11] Though Satan,
[1:15] Though Satan [singing]
[1:18] should [music] buff it, though trial
[1:23] [music and singing]
[1:24] should come,
[1:28] let [music] this [singing] blessed
[1:31] assurance
[1:34] control [music]
[1:35] [singing]
[1:40] that Christ [singing]
[1:42] [music] hath regarded
[1:46] my helpless [music]
[1:49] estate [singing]
[1:52] and hath shed [music]
[1:55] his own [singing]
[1:56] blood
[1:58] for my soul.
[2:02] [singing]
[2:04] Oh, it is well
[2:10] with my [singing] soul.
[2:16] It [music and singing]
[2:17] is well.
[2:20] It is well
[2:23] with my [singing] soul.
[2:26] My sin,
[2:30] my sin. [singing]
[2:32] Oh, the bliss [music]
[2:35] of this [singing] glorious
[2:40] thought. [music]
[2:43] My sin
[2:45] not [singing]
[2:46] in part but the whole. [music]
[2:51] Think of it now. All of it is nailed
[2:55] [music]
[2:56] [singing] to the cross.
[3:00] and I [singing] bear
[3:03] him [music] no more.
[3:06] Praise [singing] the Lord.
[3:09] [music] Praise the Lord.
[3:12] Oh, my soul. [singing]
[3:15] Would you stand with me this morning?
[3:18] Oh, it is well
[3:23] [music]
[3:24] with my [singing]
[3:26] soul.
[3:31] It is [singing and music] well.
[3:34] It is well
[3:37] with [singing]
[3:38] my [music] soul. Sing that again. It is
[3:41] well.
[3:43] Oh, it is well
[3:46] [singing]
[3:49] with my soul.
[3:56] It is well. [music] It is well [singing]
[4:02] with my soul. Let's sing the last verse,
[4:06] brother Tim.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:10] &gt;&gt; But Lord,
[4:12] haste [singing]
[4:13] the [music] day
[4:15] when my face [singing]
[4:18] shall be sight.
[4:22] The clouds [singing]
[4:24] be rolled back [music]
[4:28] as the [singing] scroll.
[4:35] The trump [music and singing]
[4:36] shall resound
[4:40] and the Lord shall [music]
[4:44] desend.
[4:46] Even [music and singing] so
[4:49] it is well
[4:52] with [music]
[4:53] my [singing] soul.
[4:58] Oh, it [singing] is well.
[5:04] with my [singing] soul.
[5:08] [music]
[5:11] It [singing]
[5:11] is well. [music]
[5:14] It is well
[5:17] with my soul. [singing]
[5:21] [music] Can you give the Lord a hand
[5:23] clap of praise this morning? [applause]
[5:25] Amen.
[5:27] Whatever the situation is, it is well in
[5:30] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[5:43] I didn't know that Josiah was going to
[5:45] sing that song,
[5:47] but it goes really it goes perfectly
[5:52] with
[5:54] the subject today. Let me [music] read
[5:59] as we're standing. Let me read the
[6:02] background on that song. The hymn, it is
[6:06] well with my soul
[6:08] was written by Horatio Spafford in 1873
[6:11] after a series of devastating personal
[6:13] [music] tragedies.
[6:15] Spafford, a Chicago lawyer, first lost
[6:17] his fortune in the great Chicago fire of
[6:19] 1871
[6:20] and his son to scarlet fever around the
[6:23] same time.
[6:25] The most significant tragedy was when
[6:27] his wife and four daughters drowned
[6:29] after their ship sank in the Atlantic
[6:32] Ocean.
[6:34] Spafford wrote the lyrics while crossing
[6:36] the ocean to join his grieving wife.
[6:39] Inspired
[6:41] by his deep faith amidst his profound
[6:45] [music]
[6:46] loss,
[6:48] he lost everything. And then he writes a
[6:50] song like that. Let's turn in our Bibles
[6:53] where we're standing
[6:55] to Psalm
[6:57] 116
[6:58] verse 16.
[7:09] I think a fitting scripture
[7:12] and a fitting psalm.
[7:16] Psalm 116 verse 16 says this,
[7:20] "Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant. I am
[7:24] thy servant [music]
[7:25] and the son of thine handmmaid. Thou
[7:27] hast loosed my bonds.
[7:30] I will offer to thee the sacrifice of
[7:33] thanksgiving
[7:35] and I will call upon the name of the
[7:37] Lord." Can we sing that that last verse
[7:41] again? You put up but but Lord is for
[7:44] thee. For thy coming we wait.
[7:48] But Lord
[7:50] is for thee.
[7:54] For thy coming
[7:58] we wait. [singing and music]
[8:02] The sky
[8:04] of the grave [music]
[8:07] is our gold.
[8:12] [music]
[8:14] The trump [singing]
[8:17] of [music]
[8:18] the angel,
[8:21] [singing] the voice
[8:23] of the Lord. [music] Blessed [singing]
[8:28] hope,
[8:30] blessed
[8:31] Rest
[8:33] of [singing and music]
[8:34] my soul.
[8:37] [singing]
[8:39] Oh
[8:40] [music] well [singing]
[8:45] with [singing] my soul.
[8:50] [music]
[8:52] [singing] It is well. [music]
[8:56] It is well
[8:59] [singing] with my soul. [music]
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[9:06] the reason that things can be well with
[9:08] our souls is because we know that you
[9:11] are on the throne.
[9:13] There is always hope in our Lord and our
[9:16] Savior Jesus Christ. Lord, we pray that
[9:19] your presence would be here with us this
[9:21] morning. And father that as we would
[9:25] leave
[9:27] this building today that we would be
[9:30] more grateful people and more mindful of
[9:33] all that you do for us. We thank you
[9:35] father in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You
[9:39] can be seated. God bless you.
[9:45] I didn't get a list of visitors, but
[9:48] welcome to all all the visitors that I
[9:51] haven't seen. God bless you. It's good
[9:54] to have you. Hope and Craig back there.
[9:56] God bless you. Um and all I I'm we're
[10:01] blessed people, friends, that we can
[10:03] open up this Bible. We can read from it.
[10:06] I've been really digesting that
[10:10] scripture over the past few days.
[10:13] Psalm 116:16.
[10:16] Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant.
[10:19] And I like the way he says this. Oh
[10:21] Lord, truly I am thy servant. I am thy
[10:25] servant and the son of thine handmade.
[10:28] Thou hast loosed my bonds. I will offer
[10:31] to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving
[10:35] and will call upon the name of the Lord.
[10:39] The sacrifice of thanksgiving. Sometimes
[10:41] thanksgiving
[10:43] being grateful isn't
[10:45] necessarily the thing that comes to our
[10:47] mind first, especially when hard times.
[10:50] Usually we're asking God and we're not
[10:54] necessarily thanking God for what he's
[10:56] done.
[10:58] the Thanksgiving story, the original
[11:00] Thanksgiving that happened
[11:04] in New England in 1621.
[11:08] It's something that I think should be
[11:10] mentioned at this time of the year.
[11:12] There's a group of people about a
[11:14] hundred people that made a made the uh
[11:19] journey from Europe over to the America
[11:22] to United to what was America back then.
[11:26] And they were truly seeking freedom of
[11:29] religion. They made this trip and it was
[11:32] very very difficult. They the
[11:37] one ship um immediately
[11:41] failed and then they all had to pile on
[11:43] this ship called the Mayflower. They had
[11:45] two ships going at first. They went
[11:48] across the Atlantic Ocean and they
[11:49] averaged only two miles an hour going
[11:52] over a couple thousand miles. there was
[11:55] no wind and then when there was wind it
[11:57] was great storms. People died and uh
[12:02] they suffered from malnutrition. They
[12:03] they got to they landed in a place that
[12:07] they didn't expect to land at in New
[12:09] England and things didn't get easier
[12:12] once they hit land. They got it got much
[12:16] more difficult. By the grace of God,
[12:19] he sent some friendly Indians to help
[12:22] them, help them learn how to grow corn,
[12:25] help them learn how to fish and survive.
[12:30] But whatever the case was, even with
[12:32] these blessings, they lost half of their
[12:36] people during that first winter.
[12:40] And it was a very very hard time for
[12:44] these what we call pilgrims.
[12:47] Then in 1621,
[12:51] the fall,
[12:53] they
[12:55] came together after they had their first
[12:57] harvest,
[12:58] and they had a feast. And it wasn't a
[13:00] feast of mourning. It wasn't a feast of
[13:04] remembering necessarily the lives of
[13:07] their husbands and their wives and their
[13:10] children that they had lost over the
[13:11] past year. It was a feast of
[13:13] thanksgiving. It truly was that
[13:17] psalm. It was an offering.
[13:21] It was a they offered a sacrifice of
[13:24] thanksgiving in the name of the Lord.
[13:26] And they were blessed. Yet just around
[13:30] 50 of them made it.
[13:32] And they were able to because of their
[13:35] journey and because of their sacrifices,
[13:39] God has blessed this country above any
[13:42] other country I believe in history and
[13:44] given us a place that we can prosper.
[13:48] We can as hard as hard as we want to
[13:51] work, the more successful we can be in
[13:55] the monetary ways. And then we also can
[13:58] worship in a way that we want to worship
[14:01] that we feel led to worship which is why
[14:04] they came here in the first place is
[14:06] they wanted that freedom
[14:09] and it wasn't something that
[14:15] it was must have been a hard thing.
[14:19] They probably were a lot thinner than
[14:22] when they started. They were probably
[14:24] many of them were sick, but they had
[14:26] this first harvest and they gave God the
[14:30] glory
[14:31] and they were thankful.
[14:34] They weren't complaining. They were
[14:36] thankful for what they have. And if
[14:41] we're not careful,
[14:44] gratitude can slip out of our lives. And
[14:48] as soon as we are ungrateful, as soon as
[14:52] that gratitude leaves, then the grace of
[14:55] God will also lift off of our lives. Not
[14:59] because it was God's choice for him to
[15:01] pull back his grace, but because we've
[15:04] created an environment of being
[15:08] unthankful and of complaining.
[15:11] And it's the world today is a very
[15:14] entitled society.
[15:17] We think that if we have to suffer just
[15:18] a little bit that the world's going to
[15:22] come to an end and and everybody owes us
[15:25] and and we should never have a problem.
[15:28] But sometimes, I think all the time, we
[15:31] need to make sure that we thank God for
[15:33] the trials and the suffering
[15:36] &gt;&gt; just as we thank God for the good times
[15:40] just as these pilgrims did. And I think
[15:44] I hope that I can encourage the
[15:46] congregation to pray to be more
[15:50] thankful. Pray to be more grateful. And
[15:54] then
[15:56] thank the Lord for your gratefulness.
[15:58] Thank the Lord that you are thankful
[16:01] because you do. you understand really
[16:03] what what has been given to you and the
[16:06] grace that we have and how much how easy
[16:09] we have it and especially compared to
[16:12] those that we celebrate this week, those
[16:14] pilgrims that really suffered. They did
[16:17] and I think that they were a very very
[16:18] good example to us and how we should be
[16:21] grateful for what we have. They they
[16:23] went through it and they lost
[16:26] everything.
[16:27] Sister Shirley, I think it was you that
[16:31] we were talking about prayer one night
[16:32] on a Wednesday night talk and and I
[16:35] think it was you that said when you pray
[16:38] many times that you'll just start
[16:39] thanking the Lord for his goodness. And
[16:42] I do the same thing is if I don't know
[16:45] like Lord, how do I approach you? A lot
[16:47] of times I'll just get on my knees or
[16:49] I'll even sit back in my chair at home
[16:52] and I'll just start thanking him for all
[16:55] the things that he's given me. and
[16:57] thanking him for my family and and a
[17:00] church and and the word of God and and
[17:03] my health and my family's health and my
[17:06] friends and and then you'll start doing
[17:08] that. And then God appreciates that. He
[17:12] welcomes as as you're going to see in a
[17:15] story that I'll close with later on. He
[17:18] loves [snorts] thanksgiving. He loves a
[17:22] grateful heart.
[17:25] And these things that
[17:29] we suffer,
[17:31] we should always remember that nothing
[17:34] good comes without a sacrifice. Let that
[17:39] sink in for a minute. That nothing good
[17:42] comes without something sacrificing
[17:44] first. A mother when a baby is born, she
[17:49] suffers.
[17:51] she the there's there's great pain and
[17:54] even the the mother's life is in danger
[17:59] and it's it's a hard time that that
[18:01] labor and that that leadup to the birth.
[18:04] But when that child is born, the
[18:08] suffering,
[18:10] the mother doesn't really think of what
[18:12] she just went through. She's tired and
[18:14] she's beaten down, but you lay that
[18:16] little baby on her on her chest
[18:19] and all she can think of is this just
[18:22] precious little gift that God has given
[18:24] her and she's just grateful for that and
[18:27] all that suffering goes away and it's
[18:31] but it did come through suffering. It
[18:33] came through sacrifice.
[18:36] And most of the time we also
[18:40] we want to thank God for the suffering.
[18:44] And I was asking myself last night, what
[18:49] do we do more?
[18:51] Do we ask God
[18:53] or do we thank God?
[18:56] Which one do we do more? Do we ask him
[18:59] or do we thank him?
[19:01] Do we have do we offer him a sacrifice
[19:04] of thanksgiving during hard times that
[19:07] that we might be struggling? We might be
[19:09] in need for a family member or for
[19:10] ourselves financially, for our health,
[19:13] whatever it might be. Are we constantly
[19:15] asking
[19:17] or
[19:19] are we thanking him? Thanking him for
[19:21] the trial that we're going through. I
[19:24] was last week
[19:26] I was with uh brother Steve who preached
[19:29] on Saturday night and u we were up in
[19:32] Sabino Canyon and we met a uh there
[19:36] there was one of the workers that were
[19:37] were there. She was dressed in like a a
[19:39] Forest Service uniform
[19:42] and she came walking by. She was from
[19:45] the uh she's from Holland and
[19:49] she came walking by. We were sitting at
[19:51] the the picnic table waiting for Daniel
[19:53] and your friends were up hiking and
[19:58] she uh she waved at us and I like I
[20:01] always do I greeted her and uh and
[20:03] struck up a conversation
[20:05] and uh I I asked her I said we were
[20:10] talking about the beauty of Sabino
[20:11] Canyon especially it had just rained and
[20:12] if you ever been up in Spino Canyon
[20:14] after a rain and the clouds are kind of
[20:17] low wow it is I don't know if there's an
[20:19] equal to it in the whole the world. We
[20:21] were we were um just kind of we were
[20:24] talking with her and about how pretty
[20:26] things were and I asked her I said, "Are
[20:29] you a Christian?"
[20:31] Because I saw that she had a lot of
[20:32] respect for the environment. And usually
[20:36] people will say something on the order
[20:38] of, "Well, I I know God uh but but you
[20:41] know, I know that there's a creator
[20:43] there or I just don't go to church." And
[20:45] what they're really saying is that I I
[20:48] know God, but I know him on my terms.
[20:51] That he's he's God and he's there when I
[20:54] need him, but uh just as far as serving
[20:57] him, no. But but she answered in a
[20:59] different way. This lady was very firm
[21:02] and to the point. And she said, "No, I'm
[21:07] an atheist."
[21:09] And
[21:11] I thought I thought, "Okay." Um,
[21:15] and I said, you know, I said, I can't
[21:16] help but look at these mountains and
[21:18] look at these cactus and look at just
[21:20] the beauty. I can't help but think of
[21:22] God when I look at these things. It just
[21:25] it just inspires me. And she gave me a a
[21:30] a very strange response.
[21:34] And she said that
[21:37] nature is what convinces her that there
[21:40] is no God.
[21:43] And I thought wow we are on opposite
[21:45] ends of the spectrum here
[21:48] [laughter]
[21:49] very nice very nice person and uh so I
[21:53] said really
[21:55] I said I don't understand that and she
[21:58] said let me give you an example
[22:01] and she gave me
[22:04] an example of a tarantula hawk wasp.
[22:09] Does anybody know what a tarantula hawk
[22:10] wasp is? Let me give you a little
[22:12] background on what that wasp is. Don't
[22:14] ever get stung by it because it's
[22:15] probably the most deadly wasp in the
[22:17] world. And it it's very very painful,
[22:21] but it's one of those big black wasps. I
[22:24] think they have red wings. And they just
[22:26] flying around, man. They look
[22:27] intimidating. You're like, whoa, I think
[22:29] I'll stay clear. What they do is they're
[22:33] actually they they eat pollen,
[22:37] but they the way that they reproduce.
[22:42] And then this is the reason they call
[22:43] them a tarantula hawk. They would come
[22:45] down and they will they will attack a
[22:48] tarantula, big spider, and they'll get
[22:50] on top and they'll sting this spider.
[22:53] And it doesn't kill it, but it it
[22:56] paralyzes it. They'll grab the spider
[22:59] and they'll pull it down into a hole and
[23:02] then they will lay their eggs on that
[23:05] tarantula
[23:07] and those eggs will hatch. Now, the
[23:09] tarantula is alive. He's preserved
[23:10] because he's still breathing and doing
[23:12] what spiders do before they're dead. And
[23:15] the the the hatchlings of this wasp will
[23:19] feed on this big giant spider.
[23:23] And she she gives this example of a
[23:26] tarantula hawk and she says, "How could
[23:30] God
[23:32] do something like that?"
[23:35] And she has this image of God in her
[23:37] mind that actually most people have that
[23:40] God is this this big happy as brother
[23:46] Bram called him a dotie grandpa
[23:49] that just is all good and all like like
[23:52] maybe Santa Claus at Christmas time.
[23:56] And that was that's her understanding of
[23:58] God. and and she says, "Well, there
[24:00] can't be a God in all of this suffering
[24:02] and dying and all of this hardship in
[24:04] the world." And unfortunately, that is
[24:07] how many people, if not most people
[24:09] think. They don't understand how God can
[24:12] allow suffering and dying and and
[24:14] problems even with this wasp and this
[24:17] spider. And I told her, I said, "You
[24:21] chose
[24:23] the exact
[24:26] example
[24:28] of Christ
[24:31] in with mankind."
[24:34] I said, "You I said, look, this whole
[24:36] the whole story of the tarantula hawk is
[24:38] a story of sacrifice so something else
[24:41] can live."
[24:43] I said, 'Here comes this wasp and it
[24:46] lays its eggs on this spider. This
[24:49] spider is now a sacrifice.
[24:52] This spider's life is given so these
[24:54] other um these other insects can live.
[24:58] And I said, that's what Jesus did.
[25:01] Jesus died, was sacrificed on the cross
[25:05] so that we can live. I said just your
[25:08] story explain the very meaning of
[25:11] Christianity
[25:13] and it's it's suffering
[25:17] God the way be after the fall of of of
[25:21] it wasn't God's fault but after the fall
[25:24] of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden
[25:27] something had to die so something else
[25:29] could live
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Adam Abel Adam and Eve's son. He offered
[25:38] a lamb because he knew that God the
[25:42] Father had killed a a lamb or a sheep to
[25:47] make skins for Adam and Eve when they
[25:50] when they die, when they fell, when they
[25:52] sinned. So Abel knew this. So he knew to
[25:55] stay the wrath of God to cover their
[25:58] nakedness. He knew that you have to kill
[26:02] something as a sacrifice to take the
[26:05] place of the sinner. Exactly what
[26:08] happened with this tarantula and this
[26:11] wasp. It had to die so something else
[26:14] could live. It's the way nature and it's
[26:17] so beautiful how nature is. Everything
[26:19] that we look at just preaches Jesus
[26:22] Christ
[26:24] &gt;&gt; from the mountains to the valleys to the
[26:26] cactus to the trees to the insects. It's
[26:30] all about him. It's all about Jesus.
[26:34] But it's about sacrifice. It's about
[26:36] living and dying. What is the the lion
[26:40] king? The circle of life.
[26:43] It is
[26:44] &gt;&gt; it's a great circle of life.
[26:47] And there's coming a time when there
[26:49] will be no death. The Bible promises it.
[26:51] But until that time, we are living in
[26:53] this world. And this world is a cruel
[26:55] world. God is a loving God. He is not a
[26:57] cruel God. God makes a way for us.
[27:01] That's what people don't understand is
[27:03] no. If you just lived in this cruel
[27:06] world, you would be lost to sin and
[27:09] death and hell. But Jesus made a way.
[27:14] And that's why we're here. That's why we
[27:16] want to bring others in to show that
[27:18] that sacrifice,
[27:21] it's suffering, that we should be
[27:24] thankful for it. There's many people,
[27:27] there's people here in this building
[27:30] right now that were hurt by their former
[27:31] churches.
[27:33] People insulted them, offended them, ex
[27:38] exccommunicated them maybe,
[27:40] and they were hurt. So they left a
[27:42] church and many many found themselves
[27:45] alone and some are finding now finding
[27:49] soloulless and finding comfort here at
[27:51] the Tucson Tabernacle. But instead of
[27:54] having resentment in our hearts for some
[27:58] for another church or someone else, what
[28:00] about offering a sacrifice of
[28:03] thanksgiving
[28:05] &gt;&gt; to the Lord and say, "Thank you, Lord.
[28:07] Thank you that you allowed me to be hurt
[28:10] &gt;&gt; because now I'm a better person. Thank
[28:13] you that you allowed me to go through
[28:15] these things because if if life was just
[28:18] a a flowery bed of ease, I don't think
[28:20] any of us would be saved. I don't think
[28:23] we would have the character that God
[28:24] wants us to have. I don't think we would
[28:26] appreciate the blood of Jesus Christ if
[28:29] we had not fallen into sin. How could we
[28:32] appreciate a savior?
[28:35] &gt;&gt; I don't think that we can.
[28:37] So when we fail,
[28:40] thank God.
[28:42] Offer him that sacrifice of
[28:46] thanksgiving.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Offer him and say, "Lord, thank you. I
[28:50] failed, but thank you that there is the
[28:52] blood there." And my experience of being
[28:56] heard, it made me dig into the word
[28:59] myself and I can look back and I can
[29:02] say, "Thank you. It made me really find
[29:04] my own personal walk with the Lord
[29:06] Jesus. And not be reliant on on a church
[29:09] or someone else.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Stephanie asked me this morning.
[29:16] She said that if people see the error in
[29:21] their churches and leave,
[29:24] does it open the door for sin to come
[29:26] into their lives?
[29:28] That's a very good question.
[29:31] No. I don't think so. And this is this
[29:34] is my answer to Stephanie that no, I
[29:37] think that sin was already in their
[29:39] heart and it was just waiting to
[29:42] manifest itself outwardly.
[29:45] And if they left,
[29:48] that sin was just sitting there.
[29:51] And friends, we can die and have sin in
[29:54] our heart. That's why we're going to get
[29:56] back into the sermon on the mount. Jesus
[29:58] is going after the heart of a person and
[30:02] not the outside because the heart is
[30:05] what condemns us.
[30:07] And with people, if if they have a bad
[30:11] experience,
[30:13] give thanks
[30:15] that the Lord will help us and the Lord
[30:19] will will
[30:21] he'll he'll undertake for us. If we
[30:23] could just search him and and allow our
[30:26] trials and our tribulations as they did
[30:28] in New England 400 years ago, allow
[30:33] those things to make you a better person
[30:36] and make a more rugged Christian and a
[30:39] more rugged servant of God. When a a a
[30:42] soldier goes into battle, that soldier
[30:46] has training. That soldier is ready to
[30:49] go fight. But if you send somebody out
[30:52] that has no training, that doesn't know
[30:54] what they're doing, they're just gonna
[30:55] get smoked right away.
[31:00] But we these things that we go through,
[31:02] they're actually training for us and
[31:04] they help us.
[31:06] There's a amazing story in the Bible
[31:10] about giving God thanks that I would
[31:13] like to read and I'd like to spend the
[31:15] remainder of the service on this. And it
[31:18] has a pretty amazing ending.
[31:21] that I never really understood until
[31:24] this week, until I've been praying about
[31:25] this and studying about this scripture.
[31:27] It's about the 10 lepers. And you know,
[31:30] I hope probably most of you know the
[31:32] story that 10 were healed, then one came
[31:35] back to give thanks. Let's read it and
[31:38] then we'll dig into it. Luke 17 11.
[31:45] Luke 17:11 says this, "And it came to
[31:48] pass," speaking of the Lord Jesus, "As
[31:50] he went to Jerusalem that he passed
[31:52] through the midst of Samaria and
[31:54] Galilee, and as he entered into a
[31:56] certain village, there met him 10 men
[31:59] that were lepers, which stood a far off,
[32:02] and they lifted up their voices, and
[32:04] said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."
[32:07] And when he saw them, he said unto them,
[32:10] "Go show yourselves unto the priests."
[32:13] And it came to pass that as they went,
[32:15] they were cleansed. And one of them,
[32:18] when he saw that he was healed, turned
[32:21] back, and with a loud voice glorified
[32:24] God, and fell down on his face at his
[32:28] feet, giving him thanks. And he was a
[32:31] Samaritan. And Jesus answering said,
[32:34] "Were not there 10 cleansed? But where
[32:37] are the nine? There are not found that
[32:41] returned.
[32:43] There are not found that return to give
[32:45] glory to God, save this stranger.
[32:49] And he said unto him, "Arise, go thy
[32:52] way. Thy faith has made thee whole." And
[32:55] like many stories in the in the middle
[32:58] of the book of Luke,
[33:01] this is this isn't in any other gospel.
[33:03] It isn't in Matthew, it isn't in Mark,
[33:04] and it is in in John. It's just in Luke.
[33:08] So this story um this is the only place
[33:11] that this story is mentioned. We know
[33:13] from our Wednesday night Bible studies
[33:16] that Luke probably never met Jesus in
[33:19] person. He uh
[33:23] he probably well we know that he was
[33:26] tasked by this man Theopoulos to write a
[33:31] narrative
[33:33] of Jesus Christ and his life and then
[33:37] write another narrative of what happened
[33:41] when the life of Jesus went into the
[33:45] apostles. The first one was the book of
[33:47] Luke and he probably interviewed many
[33:50] many people that were there that were
[33:52] present at the time when Jesus was here.
[33:54] And the second
[33:56] paper that he wrote, the second document
[33:58] he wrote was the book of Acts. Both were
[34:02] meant to report on the works of the Lord
[34:05] Jesus. One before his resurrection, one
[34:08] after his resurrection.
[34:11] this story. Um,
[34:14] while he was this thought just came to
[34:16] my mind and I don't know and none of us
[34:19] will ever know until we get over to the
[34:21] other side, but when Luke was compiling
[34:24] this book of Luke and when he was
[34:25] writing this story, I wonder if he
[34:30] interviewed or talked to this one leper
[34:34] that came back. We don't know. But it's
[34:37] a not it's a it's a blessing to even
[34:40] think that that maybe this man gave
[34:42] personal testimony.
[34:45] They're talking about leprosy. And for
[34:47] most of the history of mankind, leprosy
[34:50] has probably been the most feared
[34:53] disease known to man. There's never been
[34:56] a cure for it really until recently. And
[34:59] it can be cured now with modern
[35:00] antibiotics.
[35:02] But it couldn't be cured in history
[35:04] unless the Lord did a miracle. Starts
[35:07] with red patches on the skin. Then it
[35:10] progresses to nerve damage, loss of
[35:13] sensation in the affected areas which
[35:15] that causes injury. So you don't feel.
[35:19] So you could pick up a burning pan and
[35:22] not have any feeling in your hand and it
[35:23] would it would cause an injury there.
[35:25] And this would happen often.
[35:28] You might pick up um you might step on a
[35:30] nail if if you have leprosy and and you
[35:33] wouldn't notice and your foot would you
[35:35] wouldn't be able to attend to it. Your
[35:37] foot would get infected and causing more
[35:39] problems. Goes from the nerve damage to
[35:42] ulcers and and deformities that start on
[35:44] the body especially in the hands and the
[35:46] feet and the face and eventually the
[35:49] tissue death results in infection and
[35:53] death to the patient.
[35:56] Once you had leprosy, this is what was
[35:58] going to happen. You had a death
[36:00] sentence. I actually saw someone when I
[36:04] was a little kid that had leprosy. I was
[36:07] in Ngalas with my parents. I was
[36:10] probably, I don't know, six or five,
[36:12] six, seven years old. And it was back
[36:16] when a lot of people used to go down
[36:17] there and go shopping and they would get
[36:19] certain things that they could get in
[36:20] Ogalas and and not get here. It was much
[36:22] safer back then. So, we were down there
[36:25] and I was just following my mom and dad
[36:28] and uh there was this man that was
[36:31] begging on the sidewalk
[36:34] and he he didn't have a nose and it was
[36:38] it was white on his face. His hands were
[36:42] deformed
[36:43] and he just he just looked really bad.
[36:46] and he uh he put his hand out when my
[36:50] parents walked by
[36:52] and I I had some money in my pocket that
[36:56] I was going to spend. I wanted to buy
[36:57] something in Mexico. I wanted to get,
[36:59] you know, something whatever, you know,
[37:01] one of those those rattles that they
[37:03] have, you know, with that look um just
[37:06] something. And uh I dug into my pocket
[37:09] and I pulled out my change and I I put
[37:12] it in his hand
[37:14] and it just struck me. I mean, I still
[37:17] see the image today. And I just kept
[37:20] walking and I remember just the how bad
[37:23] the man looked. And afterwards, my mom,
[37:28] she said, Daniel, she said, I saw you
[37:30] gave that money to that man. And I just
[37:33] got up. I was like, mom, I said, it
[37:36] wasn't very much. All I had was just my
[37:38] change. And she said, no, honey. She
[37:41] said, that probably bought him a loaf of
[37:43] bread. And it made me feel so much
[37:45] better because I just felt so
[37:46] inadequate. Even as a little kid, I I
[37:48] just had such a burden because the man
[37:50] was suffering so bad.
[37:53] This uh
[37:55] this disease,
[37:57] the priests
[37:59] in the Bible were trained to diagnose
[38:02] leprosy.
[38:04] So they could see the symptoms and they
[38:06] were able to say, "Okay, this person is
[38:10] a leper. He or she has the disease." And
[38:13] when you have that disease, when you are
[38:15] diagnosed, then you are no longer to be
[38:18] in the general population. You weren't
[38:21] allowed to even be in a walled city. You
[38:23] had to live outside of that city with
[38:26] other lepers.
[38:28] And you even had to if you were in a a
[38:30] common area, you even had to either have
[38:33] a sign or you had to announce yourself
[38:35] unclean unclean
[38:38] so that people would stay away from you
[38:40] and for the protection of the population
[38:42] so you wouldn't spread the disease. They
[38:44] didn't understand it like we understand
[38:47] it.
[38:48] And they would uh they would wrap
[38:50] themselves in linen or or whatever it is
[38:54] to hide their condition and to maybe to
[38:57] cover their soores. And they had to live
[39:00] their lives in these leper colonies, as
[39:04] I said, outside of the city. And when
[39:07] you're in that colony, you were probably
[39:09] with people with with various stages of
[39:12] leprosy. And you saw it must have just
[39:16] been a horrible horrible thing that you
[39:20] were living with these people that the
[39:23] ultimate was going to be the same for
[39:25] everyone.
[39:26] And let me stop there for a moment.
[39:31] And I want to encourage everyone.
[39:36] These lepers, they were around people
[39:39] with leprosy, not by their choice.
[39:42] But you see walking around, especially
[39:45] in this part of town, you see a lot of
[39:46] homeless people and you see them
[39:48] gathering around the street corners and
[39:49] you see how they're acting and they're
[39:52] they're doing the fentanyl.
[39:55] They they get stuck and they just they
[39:58] sit there for a long time and or they
[40:00] they get start to get sores all over
[40:02] their face from the the methamphetamines
[40:04] that they're taking. And everyone in
[40:08] that group, they look the same and
[40:11] they're struggling with the same thing.
[40:14] Be careful for all of us. Be careful who
[40:18] you're around
[40:20] because the people that you are around,
[40:23] they define you. You show me your
[40:26] friends and I'll show you who you are.
[40:29] If you're around people that are
[40:30] constantly negative and constantly
[40:32] putting everybody down and constantly
[40:34] complaining, that's who you are.
[40:38] Those are the people that you surround
[40:39] yourself with. Those are the people that
[40:41] you gravitate to, just as the people on
[40:43] the street. They gravitate towards
[40:45] fellow drug users.
[40:48] And that's us. We gravitate to people
[40:51] that are like us. [snorts] And you can
[40:53] gravitate towards genuine Christian
[40:56] brothers and sisters that have positive
[40:59] attitudes that are always thankful and
[41:01] and giving thanks or you can gravitate
[41:05] to the others.
[41:07] Look at your friends. Judge yourself.
[41:10] You can see that is who you are.
[41:15] So Jesus and these 10 lepers um Jesus
[41:18] wasn't the first one to walk by these
[41:19] people. He was they were on a
[41:22] welltraveled path to Jerusalem as the
[41:24] Bible says. So there were probably
[41:26] crowds on the same on the on the same
[41:28] road. People would walk by these men and
[41:32] they would pro they were probably
[41:33] begging and generally you know how it
[41:36] is. You see somebody maybe if you're on
[41:38] the street out here and you see somebody
[41:40] with the sores and and you see that
[41:42] they're they're an obvious addict you
[41:44] sometimes you might go over this way to
[41:47] avoid this person. And that's probably
[41:49] what was happening with these 10 lepers.
[41:53] But Jesus is different.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; He's different than than the whole
[41:57] world. When these people that had need,
[42:01] these people that are suffering, it's
[42:03] strange how Jesus gravitates to those
[42:06] people. He gravitates to really the
[42:08] people that need him. Think about Mary
[42:10] Magdalene. Think about Legion.
[42:13] Think about the Sarapheneician woman
[42:15] with with her possessed daughter. blind
[42:17] Barnameus,
[42:19] the man at the pool of Bethesda. All of
[42:22] these had a need and Jesus found himself
[42:25] with those people. So he went to those
[42:28] people. Those were really those were his
[42:30] people.
[42:32] And
[42:35] that's
[42:37] really the people with the spirit of
[42:40] Jesus.
[42:41] That's who we should be going to. Also
[42:44] those people that need us might be
[42:47] family members. It might be somebody on
[42:50] the streets,
[42:52] especially people, you know,
[42:55] those people that need us. If you have
[42:58] the spirit of Christ, don't you think
[43:00] you should do what Jesus did and go to
[43:03] those people? Jesus was an excellent
[43:06] example. And if we have a spirit, it's
[43:08] called the Holy Spirit. It's just Jesus
[43:12] living in here. It's that simple. So,
[43:15] let's let's go back to this.
[43:18] Luke chapter 17
[43:20] verse 11. And it came to pass as he went
[43:24] to Jerusalem that he passed through the
[43:26] midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as he
[43:28] entered into a certain village, there
[43:30] met him 10 men that were lepers which
[43:33] stood a far off. Notice they had to keep
[43:35] their distance. Remember, unclean,
[43:37] unclean.
[43:39] But somehow,
[43:42] I don't know how they knew that this was
[43:44] Jesus. They called him out by name.
[43:46] Maybe it was his reputation. But
[43:49] whatever the case was, when they saw
[43:52] Jesus, and the same with us, all of a
[43:55] sudden, there was hope in their lives.
[43:58] It gave them hope. There where there was
[44:01] nothing but pain and nothing but being
[44:03] an outcast and being embarrassed
[44:05] wherever they went. when they saw Jesus,
[44:07] when Jesus came into their lives, all of
[44:10] a sudden they had hope. It wasn't, it
[44:14] doesn't even say hope of hope of
[44:16] deliverance. It doesn't say hope of
[44:17] being healed, but just him being there
[44:20] made everything
[44:23] better.
[44:25] We don't understand the power in that
[44:29] name of Jesus. No matter what is going
[44:33] on, no matter how bad things may be,
[44:36] these 10 lepers, they just cried out to
[44:39] him saying, "Have mercy on us." And we
[44:43] can do the same. We don't have it as bad
[44:46] as they had it. And they lifted up their
[44:49] voices
[44:51] and they said, "Jesus, master, have
[44:56] mercy on us."
[44:58] They acknowledge him. Jesus being a man
[45:01] of authority, a ruler when they called
[45:03] him master, a man who can heal the sick,
[45:06] a man who can change the situation.
[45:10] And they cried out for mercy. And I read
[45:13] this a couple times.
[45:15] And
[45:17] they didn't ask for healing.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; They didn't ask for for deliverance from
[45:22] leprosy. They asked for mercy.
[45:25] They wanted God's will. They just wanted
[45:28] they wanted Jesus in their lives. They
[45:31] needed something. Whatever Jesus was
[45:34] willing to give them is what they
[45:36] wanted.
[45:41] What does Jesus do next? It's a bit out
[45:43] of character for what Jesus does next.
[45:47] It's very strange. And when he saw them,
[45:51] he didn't say, "You're healed." When he
[45:54] saw them, he didn't say, "Receive your
[45:57] healing."
[45:59] And when he saw them, he said unto them,
[46:01] "Go show yourselves unto the priest."
[46:04] They weren't healed.
[46:07] Go show yourselves unto the priests.
[46:11] All right? So remember the priests, they
[46:13] had the authority and they had the
[46:14] training to diagnose leprosy. So if if
[46:19] you were sick, somebody turned you in or
[46:20] whatever, you came, you have leprosy,
[46:22] you have to live outside of the camp. Or
[46:25] they also had the the ability, they had
[46:28] the training to say, "You're healed of
[46:31] leprosy." It happened with Miriam,
[46:34] Moses's sister. She got leprosy
[46:38] and the Lord healed her. And the
[46:40] priests, they did what was I believe it
[46:43] was Leviticus 13 and 14, somewhere
[46:45] around there. they
[46:48] um diagnosed her, said, "Okay, now she's
[46:50] healed and there was a a purification
[46:52] that had to take place and she was able
[46:54] to come back into the congregation of
[46:56] the Lord." So he says, "Go show
[46:59] yourselves to the priests."
[47:02] All right? So this was going to have two
[47:04] a two-way effect. Number one, the
[47:07] priests were going to say, "Okay, now
[47:10] you can come back into the congregation.
[47:11] You can go back to your families because
[47:13] they had the authority to do so." And
[47:14] number two, it was going to show the
[47:16] priests that this was a genuine miracle.
[47:19] And I guarantee you, they hadn't seen
[47:20] anything like this. They just knew from
[47:22] Moses's writings, here what we do,
[47:24] here's what happens. But wow, it this is
[47:27] this just happened in our day is is what
[47:30] they would have said. So Jesus tells
[47:32] them, "Go show yourselves to the
[47:35] priest." And it came to pass that as
[47:37] they went, they were cleansed.
[47:42] So they followed the directions of
[47:44] Jesus. They had to have faith number one
[47:47] to do what he said. They didn't say,
[47:51] "Wait, wait, just just lay your hands on
[47:53] me." Or they didn't say, "Well, let me
[47:55] just come down and would you pray for
[47:57] me?" They did what he said.
[48:00] And he didn't pray for them. He didn't
[48:02] lay hands on them. He didn't pronounce
[48:04] them healed. He told them to go.
[48:10] And they went
[48:12] read that scripture again. And he saw
[48:14] them. And when he saw them, he said unto
[48:17] them, "Go show yourselves unto the
[48:18] priests." And it came to pass that as
[48:20] they went, they were cleansed.
[48:23] And one of them when he saw that he was
[48:26] healed
[48:28] turned back and with a loud voice
[48:32] glorified God.
[48:34] And he fell down on his face at his feet
[48:39] giving him thanks. And he was a
[48:41] Samaritan. Again, we know from our
[48:43] Wednesday night Bible studies that
[48:44] Samaritans are a mix between Jews and
[48:47] the Assyrians. way back, I don't know,
[48:49] it was like seven or 8 hundred years
[48:50] before Jesus, the Assyrians came in,
[48:52] they invaded um northern Israel, they
[48:56] took people captive and they settled
[48:57] that and then they um they mixed the
[49:00] races and that's where the Samaritan
[49:02] race comes from. The Samaritans thought
[49:04] that they were the rightful heirs of
[49:07] Abraham's promise, the promised land.
[49:09] The Jews thought that they were half
[49:11] reads, they were less. So there was
[49:12] always fighting between the Samaritans
[49:14] and the Jews. It's an important here
[49:16] because it's because this is a
[49:18] Samaritan. This isn't even one of the
[49:21] people that that Jesus came to first.
[49:25] This guy is he's an outcast of the
[49:28] outcast. So, he was not only was he a
[49:31] leper,
[49:32] he was also a Samaritan.
[49:35] And Jesus answering said, so he comes
[49:37] back to Jesus and he falls down on his
[49:38] feet giving him thanks. And Jesus
[49:41] answering said, "Were not
[49:44] were there not 10 cleansed? But where
[49:47] are the are the nine?
[49:49] There are not found
[49:51] that return to give him glory to God,
[49:55] save the stranger, except this one man,
[49:58] and he's a stranger. He's a foreigner."
[50:02] And he said unto him, "Arise, go thy
[50:05] way. Thy faith hath made thee whole.
[50:10] I didn't, as I was
[50:13] thinking on this and meditating on this
[50:15] and praying on this over the past few
[50:17] days, I didn't understand, Lord, he was
[50:20] already made whole. He was already
[50:23] healed. All 10 of them were healed. So
[50:26] why does Jesus re repeat himself to this
[50:30] man? But he says something different.
[50:34] And this is one of those nuggets that is
[50:37] just beautiful that is they're all
[50:40] throughout the Bible, but this one is
[50:43] something that is just precious.
[50:49] There's a difference
[50:51] in these in these words. In verse 17,
[50:55] he says that were not the 10 cleansed.
[50:57] So some translations say were not the 10
[51:00] healed. That's a different Greek word.
[51:03] Remember the New Testament is written in
[51:04] Greek. That's a different Greek word
[51:07] than verse number 19 that says made
[51:11] whole. The verse number 19 is the Greek
[51:14] word soo.
[51:16] Say well brother Daniel that doesn't
[51:19] mean much to me but it will. It's a
[51:23] Jesus said that these were healed and
[51:26] then this one he says that you are made
[51:29] whole. What does this Greek word mean?
[51:31] Soo, here's the definition.
[51:36] It says
[51:39] soo means
[51:44] it means
[51:46] it means made whole. It means delivered.
[51:50] It means saved.
[51:52] That Greek word, it it it means healed,
[51:55] too. But it has a much more important
[51:58] meaning. So this man that came back to
[52:01] Jesus,
[52:03] the other nine, they got their healing.
[52:05] He got his healing too. But this man
[52:07] that came back to Jesus just to say just
[52:09] to say thank you,
[52:11] he was saved.
[52:14] Why? Because he said thank you.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Very, very powerful scripture. God
[52:21] appreciates our gratitude. this word
[52:24] soo. Let me let me read it in uh in a
[52:27] couple different different verses here.
[52:31] Matthew chapter 1 verse 19. Then Joseph
[52:33] her husband speaking of when Jesus was
[52:35] born being a just man and not willing to
[52:37] make her a public example was minded
[52:39] minded to put her away privy. But when
[52:42] he thought on these things, behold, the
[52:44] angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
[52:45] dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
[52:47] David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary
[52:49] thy wife, for that which is conceived in
[52:51] her is of the Holy Ghost. and she shall
[52:54] bring forth a son, speaking of the birth
[52:57] of Jesus. And she shall bring forth a
[53:00] son and shall call his name Jesus, for
[53:03] he shall save so
[53:07] his people from their sins.
[53:10] Matthew chapter 10 verse 20 22 says,
[53:13] "And ye shall be hated of all men for my
[53:16] name's sake, but he that endureth to the
[53:18] end shall be saved." Soo
[53:22] saved is much greater than healed.
[53:27] Matthew chapter 8 181 says, "For the son
[53:30] of man is come to save that which was
[53:34] lost." Soo acts 2 21 and it shall come
[53:38] to pass that whosoever shall call on the
[53:40] name of the Lord shall be saved. Same
[53:43] word that Jesus said to this man.
[53:47] Now listen to this.
[53:50] Romans chapter 10 and the um the worship
[53:52] team can come. Romans chapter 10 verse
[53:55] 8. I'll read the New King James version.
[53:57] It says this. But what does it say? The
[53:59] word is near you in your mouth and in
[54:02] your heart that is the word of faith
[54:04] which we preach that if you confess with
[54:07] your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in
[54:10] your heart that God has raised him from
[54:12] the dead, you will be saved. Same word
[54:17] that he said. Soo to this leper.
[54:21] For with the heart of one believes under
[54:23] righteousness, and with the mouth
[54:25] confesseth confession is made under
[54:27] salvation. For the scripture says,
[54:28] "Whoever believes on him will not be put
[54:31] to shame. For there is no distinction
[54:33] between Jew and Greek. For the same Lord
[54:35] over all is rich to is rich to all who
[54:38] call upon him. For whoever calls on the
[54:40] name of the Lord shall be saved." Soo.
[54:46] And that leper received the same
[54:49] salvation in these scriptures as I just
[54:52] read. Why?
[54:54] Because he just came back to say thank
[54:56] you. Can you imagine?
[55:00] Nine.
[55:02] We don't know if they were saved or not,
[55:05] but one we know that he is saved and he
[55:09] received eternal life. Same as the as
[55:12] the thief on the cross that acknowledged
[55:14] Jesus. It was just one little word.
[55:17] Lord, remember me. And Jesus says,
[55:19] you're gonna you're going to be with me.
[55:22] A little word like that. This guy comes
[55:25] back. He was healed. Can you imagine? I
[55:26] I would want to go get my certificate as
[55:28] you would. Certificate from the priest.
[55:31] Go to my family AND SAY, "I'M BACK. THE
[55:33] Jesus healed me and and and live my life
[55:35] with my family. Go get a job and start
[55:37] supporting and and living my life and
[55:39] not suffering." But this man before he
[55:42] did that, he just came back and he said,
[55:44] "Thank you."
[55:47] &gt;&gt; And was given eternal life just for that
[55:51] little bit of gratitude. Do you see how
[55:53] important gratitude is? Do you see how
[55:56] important it is to just say those little
[55:58] words, "Thank you,
[56:01] and get on your knees and say, Lord,
[56:03] you've done so much for me.
[56:06] I appreciate you."
[56:09] Again, he says, "And Jesus answered,
[56:11] Were not 10 cleansed,
[56:14] but where are the nine?
[56:16] Where are the ones that I healed?
[56:20] There are not found that return to give
[56:23] glory to God except this one man, and
[56:26] he's a Samaritan."
[56:30] And then he said un unto him, the guy
[56:33] was laying there at his feet
[56:38] thanking Jesus for what he had done,
[56:40] thanking him for saving him, thanking
[56:43] him for healing him of this dreaded
[56:45] disease. [music] And how many of us have
[56:48] changed our lives,
[56:50] given up drugs,
[56:52] reconciled with our wives, our children
[56:55] have come back. How many of us have had
[56:57] the experiences that are similar to this
[56:59] man [music] and they can rejoice and
[57:02] give God glory for what he did and we
[57:04] can tell each everybody the testimonies
[57:05] and all that. But how many of us have
[57:08] just approached Jesus just me and him
[57:13] just you and him and fell down and said,
[57:17] "Lord, thank you.
[57:20] Thank you. I appreciate what you did for
[57:23] me. I appreciate all the suffering that
[57:26] you went through for me.
[57:29] And then Jesus says, arise and go thy
[57:31] way.
[57:33] Thy faith has made thee whole. So
[57:38] now,
[57:40] my son, not only
[57:43] have you been healed of your leprosy,
[57:46] but now enter [music] into the kingdom
[57:48] of heaven. Amen. Why?
[57:52] Thanksgiving.
[57:54] He said thank you.
[57:56] See how powerful it is. So say thank
[57:59] you. Say thank you to each other.
[58:02] Someone does something for you, give
[58:04] thanks.
[58:05] Give your appreciation. But especially
[58:08] what the Lord's done for you. Don't
[58:10] forget to thank him. And when you
[58:11] suffer, thank him. Lord, I don't know
[58:15] what's going on. I'm sick or Lord, I've
[58:17] lost my job or or I'm having all these
[58:19] problems. Here I am on my knees. Lord,
[58:21] thank you because I know that I'm in I'm
[58:24] in your mind. I know that you think that
[58:27] you're thinking of me. Remember when
[58:30] Jesus, he just saw that leper out there.
[58:34] He saw them.
[58:36] And if he just sees you, if you can just
[58:40] understand, if I can just understand
[58:42] that he sees me and he cares and he
[58:45] loves me,
[58:48] then I can just thank him because now
[58:51] it's it's up to him.
[58:53] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for the
[58:55] trials. Thank you for everything that
[58:56] you've done for me.
[59:01] Nine out of 10 don't say thank you.
[59:05] I want to be that one. Amen. Just say
[59:14] I have been blessed. Brother Tim,
[59:26] would you all stand with us?
[59:31] And he moves among us. All that he does.
[59:38] All of his mercy,
[59:41] all [singing] of his love.
[59:44] If the pen [music] of a rider
[59:48] would write every [singing] day,
[59:52] even [music]
[59:52] this world
[59:54] could never contain
[59:58] how I bless.
[1:00:02] Verse two.
[1:00:05] Warmth in the [music and singing]
[1:00:06] winter,
[1:00:08] flowers in spring,
[1:00:11] laughter of summer, [music] the changing
[1:00:16] of leaves.
[1:00:18] Food on my [music and singing] table,
[1:00:21] good place to sleep,
[1:00:24] clothes on [singing] my back,
[1:00:27] and [music] shoes on my feet.
[1:00:31] I have been [singing] blessed.
[1:00:36] [music]
[1:00:37] I have been blessed. [singing]
[1:00:40] God so good to me.
[1:00:43] [music] Precious are [singing] his
[1:00:46] thoughts of you and me. No way I could
[1:00:51] count them. [music and singing] There's
[1:00:53] not enough time.
[1:00:56] So I'll just thank [singing] him for
[1:01:00] being [music] so kind.
[1:01:03] God has [singing] been good.
[1:01:06] So good. [music]
[1:01:09] I have been [singing] blessed.
[1:01:13] Arms [music] that will raise.
[1:01:15] Arms that will raise. [singing]
[1:01:18] A voice that can talk. [music]
[1:01:22] Hands [singing] that can touch.
[1:01:25] and legs that can walk,
[1:01:28] ears that [music] can listen, [singing]
[1:01:31] eyes that can see.
[1:01:34] I've got to praise [music]
[1:01:36] him [singing]
[1:01:37] as long as I breathe.
[1:01:41] I have been blessed.
[1:01:44] [music]
[1:01:47] I have been blessed.
[1:01:50] God so good to me.
[1:01:53] Precious [music] are his thoughts
[1:01:55] [singing]
[1:01:56] of you and me.
[1:01:59] No way I could count them. [music]
[1:02:02] There's not [singing] enough time.
[1:02:06] So I'll just thank [music]
[1:02:08] him for being so [singing] kind.
[1:02:12] God has been good.
[1:02:15] [music] So good.
[1:02:19] I have been blessed. A mother and
[1:02:22] father.
[1:02:24] A mother and father
[1:02:28] who nurtured and raised. [music]
[1:02:31] Sisters and brothers,
[1:02:34] [music] memories made, [singing]
[1:02:37] our pastor to lead us, salter to pray,
[1:02:43] [music]
[1:02:44] stripes that can heal, and a blood that
[1:02:48] still saves. [music and singing]
[1:02:50] I have been blessed. Last verse. He's my
[1:02:54] shoulder to lean on. My shoulder to lean
[1:02:58] [singing] on when I am down.
[1:03:02] The rock where he leads me when I'm
[1:03:06] overwhelmed.
[1:03:08] Oh place where he hides me under his
[1:03:13] wing. [singing]
[1:03:15] [music] He's not just the song. He's the
[1:03:18] reason I sing.
[1:03:21] Oh, I have [singing] been blessed.
[1:03:27] Oh, I have been blessed. [music] God so
[1:03:31] good to me.
[1:03:34] Precious [music] are his [singing]
[1:03:36] thoughts of you and me. No way [music] I
[1:03:41] could count [singing] them. There's not
[1:03:43] enough time.
[1:03:46] So I'll just thank [music]
[1:03:48] him for being so kind.
[1:03:52] God has been good.
[1:03:55] So good.
[1:03:59] I have been blessed.
[1:04:02] Can you imagine
[1:04:05] if that leper if that man had never
[1:04:08] contracted leprosy?
[1:04:11] He would have just no one would have
[1:04:14] ever known who he was. No one would have
[1:04:16] ever remembered him. He may have just
[1:04:18] lived his life, had a family, and died.
[1:04:21] And the grandchildren would be the last
[1:04:24] one to even know his name, and he would
[1:04:26] be completely
[1:04:29] gone.
[1:04:32] But because he contracted the worst
[1:04:36] disease
[1:04:37] really known to man and because he
[1:04:40] suffered maybe all of those years
[1:04:44] that he was able to fall down at the
[1:04:48] feet of Jesus to look up in his eyes
[1:04:52] and to hear those words that you are
[1:04:54] made whole.
[1:04:56] It was the suffering that brought him to
[1:04:58] that.
[1:05:00] And when we suffer our little sufferings
[1:05:03] and when we go through something, thank
[1:05:06] God because he's got an end,
[1:05:10] there is hope in Jesus Christ. They
[1:05:12] said, they said, "Jesus, Master, have
[1:05:15] mercy on us."
[1:05:18] And we should be calling out the same to
[1:05:20] him. Lord Jesus, have mercy on me.
[1:05:23] Lord, I'm going through this, but I am
[1:05:25] thankful. Lord, I'm thankful that that I
[1:05:28] get to go through it. I want to give you
[1:05:31] an offering,
[1:05:33] a sacrifice
[1:05:35] of thanksgiving. I want to offer you a
[1:05:38] sacrifice of thanksgiving. That's the
[1:05:40] psalm said. Let's do that. All right.
[1:05:43] Let's thank him.
[1:05:45] Thank him every day.
[1:05:54] Now
[1:05:56] think about what you're thankful for.
[1:05:59] Think about suffering that you've gone
[1:06:00] through. Now give him a hand thinking of
[1:06:04] those things. [applause]
[1:06:11] [applause]
[1:06:13] Mary, are you thankful?
[1:06:15] God bless you, sweetheart. Praise God.
[1:06:18] Let's bow our heads.
[1:06:22] Lord,
[1:06:24] today
[1:06:26] and Father, I pray that it's every day I
[1:06:28] want to give you an offering
[1:06:31] of thanksgiving,
[1:06:33] a sacrifice. I want to offer a sacrifice
[1:06:36] of thanksgiving. Lord, tell you I love
[1:06:38] you for all that you've Lord permitted
[1:06:42] me to go through.
[1:06:44] Lord, you you permitted that leper
[1:06:47] to suffer.
[1:06:50] permitted all 10 of them to suffer, but
[1:06:52] especially that one, Lord. You permitted
[1:06:55] him to go through that. He would have
[1:06:57] maybe never ever laid eyes on Jesus
[1:07:00] Christ in his life if it was not for
[1:07:02] that disease.
[1:07:04] But he did. And you spoke those words.
[1:07:09] And Lord, you promised us as I read that
[1:07:12] that same Greek word soo that if we
[1:07:14] would just believe on you
[1:07:17] that we would receive the same.
[1:07:20] Now Lord with all of our hearts we
[1:07:22] believe on you master savior Jesus
[1:07:25] Christ.
[1:07:26] And we thank you Lord. We thank you for
[1:07:30] your kindness. I just love that song
[1:07:32] that Josiah sang. But Lord, two
[1:07:34] wonderful songs
[1:07:36] to start and to end.
[1:07:40] Songs of gratitude, thankfulness.
[1:07:43] Lord, we thank you with all of our
[1:07:45] hearts. We thank you,
[1:07:48] Lord. Now
[1:07:51] as we go
[1:07:54] Lord accept our worship
[1:07:57] as we go into the world and Lord as we
[1:08:00] witness to others
[1:08:03] Lord may it be a a witness of of
[1:08:05] happiness and joy.
[1:08:08] Lord, may it be a witness of testimony
[1:08:10] that goes out saying, "I am in this
[1:08:13] place because God put me here and I am a
[1:08:17] believer and there is all friends, there
[1:08:19] is always hope in Jesus Christ." Lord,
[1:08:21] let that be our testimony. May we be an
[1:08:24] encouragement to others. We thank you
[1:08:28] for this service. We thank you for every
[1:08:29] person here. And Lord, I'd like to name
[1:08:32] each one that is here present
[1:08:35] and maybe on the stream.
[1:08:37] And Lord, I can't do it, but I want to
[1:08:40] say thank you for each one has made the
[1:08:44] effort to be here this morning. Thank
[1:08:47] you, Lord. It's an encouragement.
[1:08:51] Thank you for your greatness and your
[1:08:52] mercy in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:08:59] I'm going through. Yes, I'm going
[1:09:01] through. Let's sing it with just our
[1:09:02] voices. This song says, "I'll pay the
[1:09:05] price whatever others do." Maybe that
[1:09:07] price is just giving the Lord thanks.
[1:09:10] Regardless of what the situation is,
[1:09:12] let's sing with just our voices.
[1:09:15] I'm going through, Jesus. I'm going
[1:09:20] through.
[1:09:22] I'll pay the [singing] price.
[1:09:26] Whatever others do,
[1:09:30] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[1:09:34] despise you. I've started with [singing]
[1:09:38] Jesus
[1:09:40] and I'm going through.
[1:09:44] I'm going through.
[1:09:48] I'm going through. [music]
[1:09:52] I'll pay the price.
[1:09:55] Whatever [singing]
[1:09:56] others do,
[1:09:59] I'll take the way with the Lord despise
[1:10:05] few.
[1:10:06] I'm going with Jesus [music]
[1:10:10] and I'm going through.

[1:13:02] he said that you can have that same
[1:13:04] spirit that was on me. that same spirit
[1:13:08] can enter into you in the form of the
