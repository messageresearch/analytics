everything I do be pleasing hey and everything I pursued be pleasing unto you and how do we please it by faith you know without faith it's impossible to please God so brother Aaron comes to take the pair across let's sing reach out and touch the Lord we touch him by faith reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy here's passing - oh you're - reach out and touch the low [Music] one more time I'll reach out and touch them ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] boy you're fine he's not too busy [Music] every to reach out and touch you know in the prayer lines there were those that would come up to be prayed for and and they're coming up believing and asking God to meet with him whatever that need was and then there were those sitting in the audience who were just asking God it caught it right in the middle of brother Brandon was stopping he would turn in he would say now you over there God will meet you if you just opened your heart to say Lord I need you and you know I was listening to pour some a message for service and brother Branham says you asked that mountain to be moved and it will be moved but he said also check your motive why do you want it to be moved and sometimes we you know a Lord I want you to do this and this so I can continue doing what I'm what I want to do the band says check your motive so just right now as we read these quiz look at yourself and said Lord is there something that maybe I've been doing wrong catch my attention on it and let's let's make it right and let God move we we have a couple of requests here the sister Joyce Duggal will be having surgery on Tuesday but they had Duggal had mentioned it to me that they had started us operation on her and they're going to finish it now so let's remember her and then sister Sarah Cotner she had had a surgery recently and was taken to the urgent care with a fever of a hundred and one so just remembering her and prayer and then sister Holly she was here with us this morning and she had asked prayer concerning one of the co-workers in the hospital that she works up down in the Green Valley area that had been taken home sick and they did find her with the cove at 19 so again God watches over his children so if you'll stand with me and and you've looked at your heart you said Lord if there's anything that's wrong I just want to say I'm sorry I want to I want to get that clean and then nothing can hinder the prayer and and God can move so let's just believe that whatever that need is just say Lord I believe and help thou my unbelief father as we come together Lord and it seems like we always have a need in in but you you're the the eternal God the all all supplying God there's never a time when you run short that that you would put us on hold because you you have to go you'll figure out how to do this Lord but every need supplied Lord and we believe that today we want our motives our heart right before you wherever we are at today listening in Lord maybe some traveling where maybe somewhere are so discouraged today that they said I'm not even going to listen in today I think at times we've all gone to a place where we're just so down and so hurting Lord we just don't feel like we can do anything but Lord let that one just reach out just extend a hand out to your Lord and you'll reach down with them Lord you know that need and we'll give you honor we'll give you glory and we'll give you praise for you alone are worthy in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may be seated brother Matt when I sent me on whatsapp here a bit ago saying though that you know that he'll be here next weekend with us so well trusting it'll it'll work out traveling schedules are a little hard right now sometimes they can't fly but that's his desire and it's our desire to they have a mirror you know God has supplies every need he's aiming in our prayer we said God you never run out but I was talking to dad a little before the service and we were talking about how faithful God is and I was sharing it with the brothers and at lunch some of the things that dad had brought us raised us up but he reminded me of one we down in about 400 miles south of the border here where we helped build the church down and it about calming and some of you folks got a chance to go down there and visit but they were having a meeting and everybody comes and they need to feed everybody there for their meetings you know and they're poor people of just in a little village not on not a whole lot there and so dad said they're used to going to the store and they can buy two eggs and three tortillas a little because that's all they could afford so dad said I told her let's go let's go buy what you need so they were hesitant and he said I just told him put in the cart everything you're going to need so they did they loaded it up and the people began to come and there was a lot of people and they were feeding and just having a wonderful time and his sister Santos that's the pastor's wife she called my dad over and said come here and she was crying so wet we filled this bowl up this morning with the food and we've been serving everybody and it's just as full as when we started what a mighty God we serve and unfailing God you know sometimes you you limit him you won't let him be gone well let him be gone today I don't know if they made Sara welcome today Danny well I'll make you welcome to Sara good to see her here today God God's been good to us and and what he's done to to help along and and he's an unfailing God so brother for the Aaron will be a ministry and again this this evening and trusting that you'll draw you know Paul say Lord I have needed I felt in my heart we would do a prayer line him I know there's needs if I asked you right now do you have a Nina I'm sure everyone would say yes I do have an either there's something I got a text from someone and say please have Bru the Matt pray for me I'm going through something you know and I'm kind of feeling like let's do a prayer line and everybody come through the prayer line not just one or two but God is more than able to meet that need sometimes maybe we're a little embarrassed sometimes we might have said Lord I've been through that line three times now but what if this is your day God said he would meet supply so if that's the way the Lord leaves well we'll see how he leaves brother Aaron just as he told me is the brother however you feel the Lord needs to do but I know I need more of him I know if I'm willing to say Here I am Lord he says then in coming I will feel you fill you to the uttermost we are heirs of the Father and joint heirs with his son so as we stand his brother and comes out and I don't know about you but I was blessed this morning it was good good to hear the word Lord so amen the same song a little Lord you are [Music] you so [Music] to I know you are so to and yes [Music] you [Music] and uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are so sing it to him just just close your eyes whatever just sing it or tell him how much you love it how much you appreciate him and watch him draw an eyedropper [Music] yes I love [Music] praise the Lord if you could take your Bibles I'd like to read from Genesis chapter 1 in a few places and then from Genesis chapter 3 no hope there's no offense I'm here to preach so I'm just gonna get right back into the word and we appreciate being with you today and again grateful for with a privilege that was extended to us by your pastor brother Matthew to be here in minister and I'm very grateful for that and for the kindness that you show us the fellowship that we have we certainly enjoy it I want to just say not from one lawyer to another but from one minister to another congratulations to brother Peter for what he's been able to accomplish and graduated from Law School passing the bar exam and you might as well get ready anytime you ever preach a good sermon there and say well it's because you're a lawyer and I can tell you I've had 20 years of that and I hope that maybe God will work more dynamically through you to where they don't attribute it to your legal training as they have for me and that would be my prayer for you but I admire what the Lord's done in his life not from an academic standpoint or a professional standpoint because there's a lot of people that go to law school graduate pass the bar but there's very very few who do it the way that he did it and I admire that just wanted to say congratulations to you from one son of God to another congratulations and also just want to say this very briefly I just wanted to thank you all for the labor that you undergo to continue some of the legacy that brother Perry the legacy of brother Perry green and in doing making sure certain materials are available and providing the message and the different resources in the message and letting the message remain the focal point and I realized that some of you've been here for decades and I just wanted to thank you and commend you for all that you've done to keep some of these resources available and in keeping this legacy legacy alive it's something that God impressed upon my heart when a couple of my friends passed away over the last few years that your legacy is all that is left you take your character and you leave a legacy and then those of us who remain we are tasked with improving and building upon in and furthering a legacy and then we we we want to push the next generation forward and just thrust them forward with a desire that they would actually exceed and go beyond us and not put them you know restrain them and condemn them and hold them back as if to say well you know we're you can't do more than us you can't do better and that's you Kenny but actually just compel them forward so take what God's done for you take away all the work that God has done through the decades here at Tucson Tabernacle and just take it forward to that great climax of the change of our bodies and just wanted to thank you for those things that you've done to further the spreading of the message and making certain things available to the body of Christ Genesis chapter 1 verse 11 and then also we'll skip to verse 28 and then Genesis chapter 3 and God said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so brother Branham calls that God's law of reproduction and then verse 28 God blessed them and they're speaking as he has created man in the image of God and he's made male and female so God is commanding both the male and female though it may be embodied in just their supernatural spirit being of man before he's even formed into flesh is still a commandment that the woman comes under and he says and God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and then I'd like to read Genesis chapter 3 verse 15 and I'm not we may not expound upon this too much but I want to read this because this is the promise which revives the commandment of Genesis 1:28 according to Genesis 111 and I'll put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed and we know her seed is cry it's the seed that comes forth from the woman and that they described in that shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and so here in even speaking the curse to the serpent he's actually prophesying Redemption and that it would come through Christ and a trust that we can stay in harmony with the message and bring some of these things out that brother branham amplifies on these verses if you could just bow our heads a gracious Heavenly Father thank you for this wonderful evening service to look out upon the congregation and see the many that are gathered together coming in expectation to hear your word even Lord I see brother Peterson and he's coming even just for for more just an extra service having already been a part of his fellowship in his service I'm sure or there's a hunger in your bride today for more word not for politics not for pretence not for popularity not for any carnal pleasure but Lord your bride is hungry for the word and I thank God that there is a an anointing that could come upon men of God to take the word and preach it to satisfy the bride's hunger and the bride's thirst and Lord may we as we feed on this word be changed he turned internally and eternally that it might manifest your great purpose so bless the word which we've read give us a discipline tonight is here and speaker to stay in the channel that you might impart the things that are necessary for us and Lord you take control this service from now to the very end the very close however you would lead your people Lord we believe that you're able to heal hearts and to deliver and to set free we commit it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and you may be seated we're gonna just jump right into this and continue on the subject of fulfilling the original finishing God's original purpose for the original creation and we're taking even the statement the threefold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve and amplified how that in this endtime the bride is fulfilling the original she is completing her part in the threefold purpose of God how they did the first part the second part come together in the third part and the condition of the Garden of Eden and we're drawing our inspiration from the statement and power of transformation where brother bam said there was Adam and Eve walking in the garden every seed bringing forth and he said there's where we're facing yet and I'm skipping just a little bit but there's where we're facing yet the completion of that word so we are facing today or we are tasked with today the commandment and the responsibility to finish something not completed by Adam and the woman Adam and the woman were under a command they had a purpose they had something they were to accomplish and he's saying we're gonna keep we're gonna do it today whatever was left undone by the man and the woman in the garden the bride with through Christ or Christ through the bride is gonna do it and nothing will be let be left over let nothing will remain and it'll be it'll be brought to a climax and then once that once that transpires then you there's it's almost just like a succession of things that happened God doing housekeeping to get us to that eighth day where we live eternally with our with our Lord there in the heavens new heavens and new earth and those that would all those that would populate outside of the city and then I'd be a just a glory without end so now I want to look at that word as he says that we're facing the completion of that word I want to look at that word to understand what it is that's being fulfilled today what it is that's being completed or finished today and I want to I want to set it this way there was Adam and the woman in Eden under a command of Genesis 1:28 according to the law of reproduction of Genesis 111 so there was a man and a woman in in Eden in a garden in Eden under the command of Genesis 1:28 - to fulfill or to according to the law of reproduction in Genesis 111 and so Genesis 1:28 and I realize also the Lord just very supernaturally did a couple things for me over the last 24 hours to just give me such a peace in a direction to minister on this and just realized I realized it this morning that I preached on some of these very same principles last fall and when I remember in doing so that it was just kind of laying it out there in a very abbreviated way and tonight I just get to expound upon that so if you come away from this saying oh brother Aaron preached that last time he was here I agree with you I'll just accept it you know I just say okay alright is it a compliment or you know but I just want to amplify some of these things a little bit more because I believe that that when we Minister many times you just kind of hit the high points but you could take these things and drill them down on the message and go so deep with them and see that they're there absolutely backed up with Scripture and quote after quote after quote and so the statement the commandment and just went Genesis 1:28 god blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and remember God made the earth for the purpose of getting a bride out of it be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and so now as we refer to that those silent years all those silent and the scriptures silent on them living out under under this command to subdue and to I have dominion in these things we know that brother Branham shows us that there was perfect harmony there in the Garden of Eden a perfect understanding love of God holiness and perfection and all those things we looked at this morning and so you had man and a woman in a beautiful garden and that was God's masterpiece when God saw that it was very good to him and this is what he envisioned and what he saw and Genesis 1:28 as we made this statement a moment we're just kind of amplify a moment ago we're amplifying this this is according to God's law of reproduction that every seed must bring forth of its own kind at specie it must be reproduced by seed so the certain cattle each genus and then each specie were to bring forth of its own kind and and this is what God's original design was and that's why the original sin is as horrible as it is because it broke God's original commandment that each seed must bring forth of its kind and brother Bram called them the original scent of mongrel isin or a hybrid it was a mixing of seed and that's the great transgression and so it was to bring forth of its own kind and then when God looks upon Adam in verse 18 Genesis chapter 2 verse 18 as they had been formed as one flesh formed as a supernatural spirit being first then that being is put into a body of flesh and then he still sees the one the singular man and he says it is not good that man should be alone I will make a help meet for him in other words though God is expressing himself in creation and though man upon earth was in the likeness of God in heaven he seized this and he says it's not good because God's expression is not complete God's desire was not to have a man that looked like him but to have a bride of his choosing so when he has a man in his own image and he expresses the sentiment that it's not good it's because there was still a further expression of God to be made known and brother Branham says it this way in the masterpiece when God made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right I said well what's wrong was his nose too big and and was he not tall enough he says because he was by himself so what wasn't right is that man was by himself if God only desired to have a man who had a woman inside of him that he could fellowship with her spirit inside of him then God was fine in the beginning with his thoughts but because God wanted to give expression to himself and to bring forth the bride it's now reflected and Adam says because he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was the eternal and man now in the image of God also existed on earth by himself isn't this a beautiful picture so he must have struck a little blow over the left side and from there he took a piece that struck off of it and made him a helpmate a wife then he wasn't by himself he had somebody with him he says and that's his great work so God's great work wasn't just creating the the galaxies and all the heavens and the stars and bringing forth the earth and creation in all cattle and all sorts of living beasts upon the earth and then creating man and setting him forth in on the earth but his great work was to actually bring out of Adam the woman not another creation but the further expression of the same creation and so now Adam and woman are a further expression of God the Adam was an expression of God but there still was a hidden mystery in Adam and that was the wife that was the woman and so it's a clearer more complete portrait of who God is and as the scripture says in verse 22 of chapter two in the rib which the Lord God had taken from a man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and brother BAM comments on that scripture says he is showing portrayed here the bride so when he takes the rib and he makes a woman brother man said he's portraying or showing the bride what God was actually wanting to do is do something in the beginning that the bride today could look back and seeing the word and say what he did to Adam he is doubt now brought me forth through Christ to give us the benefit of the end time to look back and see everything God has done and even brings to the back part of God's mind and see it all unfold before the beginning of time before there was a speck of Stardust before God had even formed himself to the logos and see that he had a singular purpose and desire to have you and so he said he's showing here portrayed here the bride so he brings forth to help me and this help meet as we looked at last fall and I know you all remember it perfectly some of you were thinking oh he was here before oops you forgot but he's via help mean it needs to be one who's at hand who's always near who's ready to help ready to please weather ready to comfort and the very word the very Hebrew word means one before him as in a mirror so it's it's not the exact replica but it's an opposite so when you see yourself in the mirror you see a reverse image or an opposite and so that's kind of the image that they're saying about the woman she wasn't exactly like him but it was the opposite so that there was it was complimentary to him one before him and actually the word suggests a second self the the woman was one who is a second self of Adam to help him in the labor she was a perfect resemblance of the man she was neither inferior nor superior but in all things she was like and equal to him but opposite and brother branham said in the beginning the woman was made co-equal with the man it is only through the fall that she has made lower and becomes a weaker vessel but she was co-equal under the original marriage covenant it was the man and the woman co-equal in the beginning and when a man and the woman is brought into the man he says this was now bone of my bones and she's flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman not not not because whoa man but woman because she came from man she was taken out of the man and he's decided that they were both naked the man and the woman the man and his wife and were not ashamed God is foreshadowing that eternal Eden of Christ in his bride says therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and this is still a mystery the mystery of one flesh and brother branham says in the rising of the Sun and he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the man at the station of the fulfilling of all the revelations heady men this is the bride the bride has to come forth and she's the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the bride it can only manifest that does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him let's not water it down let's not try to qualify it don't even try to figure it out we don't need to resolve the paradox how can she be him just accept it say man I believe it she is him and that's how we the bride is portrayed here in Genesis chapter 2 when the woman comes forth bone of his bone flesh and his flesh life of his life power of his power the bride she is him and so the Adam and the woman were God's first masterpiece the man and the woman in a perfect Eden with a mission so it wasn't that God was satisfied the man and the woman all I'm satisfied and in its complete no they were under a commission so when God looked upon the man of the woman in Garden of Eden he loved this world this is what God loved because the Bible said for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but should have everlasting life now that that says that God loved the world we accept that right but then John writes and says love not the world nor the things of the world because if you love the world the love of the father's not in you so now we've got a problem God so loved the world that He died for it but now you're told that if you love it you don't have the love of God in you and the reason is because we don't understand what the world was that God loved this is the world that God loved the world that He created in the beginning brother man said his soul pleased him when he saw his creation that even just went to rest put him under the commandment you guys bring forth and so the Garden of Eden is the enclosure of God's delight this is the world that God loved this is the world that God brought forth this was the world that was only his spoken word under creation under manifestation under Authority in manifesting the very purpose of God with the Commission to unfold and bring forth every son or daughter of God that would ever be that's the world that God loved same enters in and defiles it and it enters into a fallen State God so loved that world that He gave His only begotten Son to redeem that world and to bring you back to that world Genesis 1:28 again God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it so part of God's original purpose we completely realized then that part of God's original purpose is not just a man and a woman but a man a woman and their seed the expression the progeny the fruit of their union God did not just contemplate man and on an eternal date in this wonderful Adam no kids no that's not the way he envisioned it he envisioned a the setting where the man and the woman would bring forth now I trust that you just stay very close to what I'm trying to say tonight because we understand and we know the things that brother branham says that even says that the woman would have eventually brought forth that child referring to Christ so and this is not in in an absolute sense that the way that was the way that it was supposed to be but in the way that it was designed that's the way it would have been that's what brother Branham I believe brother man means what he says that is not that that's what it was supposed to be that had it not been interrupted that's what it would have been and so we know them that God's original design and purpose was not just to have a man and a woman who were married and nothing else but they were to bring forth children and it says this it's in the very commandment that we should recognize this in Genesis chapter 2 verse 24 therefore shall a man leave now notice this this prophecy that comes forward the woman is formed and she comes out of Adam and then when the woman is brought to the man under inspiration the Scriptures begins to speak for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother so it immediately begins to imply that there has to be more to the original commandment than just a man and a woman they have to become fathers and mothers therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now there's no question that you can see in type or in symbol that Adam left his father and even Mother Earth to redeem his wife but it is intended in the original bringing forth of the woman that there would be a son who would have to leave mother and father and cleave to his own wife therefore shall a man leave his father and mother so Clevelanders wife and they shall be one flesh now how is it they become one flesh you follow me in this and that this is where it just becomes very natural to understand this when you take a man and a woman and especially Adam and the woman it would be all Adam would be one DNA sequence and the woman would it be entirely made up of everything that was in Adam so the woman comes from Adam if they were to bring forth the son it would be a reproduction of the man again and the flesh of the woman and the flesh of the man are now reproduced in the children because they become one flesh you can't divide that's why when people say well who do you think the baby looks like and I said well that baby looks like what a baby would look like if that man and that woman had a baby because that's what it looks like well it's got his daddy's eyes and it's got his mother's nose and we'll try to separate that out and it's because they were joined together and rejoined in the flesh in brother branham makes this statement in marriage and divorce we're speaking about a woman having a child he says then she becomes a part of this man think about that he's talking about having children since then she becomes a part of this man and he's through it's through child buried according to first Timothy 2:15 that is how the woman becomes a permanent part of the man when she brings forth the child and now you can see even how this act of redemption that brother Branham said that God could have destroyed the woman and could have judged even burned her up but what Adam did oh my just think of it what Adam did is he had deposited a part of himself and to the woman and God could not judge the woman because now she's a part of the man again and he cannot strike her with judgment so this part of the original this is part of the original word and so the word signified that there was to be more to this masterpiece are you keeping with me so far and that's oh and listen I know that it may be the manner of some to say you know saying man say Amen but listen if I if I ever do that where I said say hey man don't you dare say it unless you can a man it just because the preacher says say man only say a man if the word says it only if the Holy Ghost and you can punctuate every word of God within a man because sometimes I know what it's like a brother was like can you say man to that you'd be like you're just waiting for him say do you love the Lord you're going yes yes I do I do that do that so if you can if it's according to the word feel free to express your a man's and I'm doing I want to stay faithful to the message and so I'm expressing something in this that brother branham it being very delicate with it brother branham it teaches us these things and here the scripture is showing us that there's going to be a union and they shall be one flesh and so brother Branham writes it this way in the pergamene church age the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God so the woman was not there just to pat him on the back and then whisper in his ear and tell him how handsome he was and how strong he was and say oh honey could you just make the wind blow a little softer no she was there to assist him in his labor and his purpose because they were under a commandment to multiply and replace the earth be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and she's there to produce another son of God in the original image so she was to bring forth another son in the original image now if you want to bring that begin to bring that down to our day and I'll try to do this more in more detail later that's why brother Branham says denominations cannot bring forth children because they're hybrid they're not back to the original that's why we had to be restored back to the original so that sons and daughters could be reproduced again under a word birth there is not a birth that can take place in organized religion there's not a birth that can come forth in denominations because it's a hybrid daughter of a harlot they cannot produce sons and daughters of God it's got to be through the original word again otherwise it's hybrid all is its mongrelized so in when when the scripture says well I want to make to help me again I know that I ministered on the subject when I spoke last year and again I know you remember it perfectly on the glory of the son of men how'd that he he had a work that he was to do he says I'll make a help meet for him and then in Genesis chapter 2 verses 18 to 20 it describes Adam working by himself God brought all the beasts of the field and all the cattle and Adam named all of them because there was a work that he could do by himself and there was a lot that he could accomplish by himself but yet there was a work that he could not do by himself Adam could not finish all the work that he was given without the woman Adam couldn't say well I'm to be fruitful multiply and replaced your bless God who needs somebody I can do this on my own no every time Adam saw a male a bull every time he saw Mel a specie he's like oh there's a female male female male female male female male female and no doubt him it it must something much the register to him and was identifying with this pattern in this image and he knew there's got to come a further expression in order for me to fulfill my purpose according to Genesis 111 and according to Genesis 1:28 so Genesis 1:28 required a wife it required it and so brother Branham speaking of Jesus he said he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that fruit was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time so there is a work which are which means there are certain things for a specific time there is something that must be done now that all that he could only do through his wife and this is and remember what is the woman for to reproduce the image of God so Adam had to have a woman to reproduce the image of God through entry entered reproduce to even the image of himself and brother branham's using a language that tells us that God has to bring forth the wife in this hour in order to do something that he could not do by himself and if he raises up a bride the bride's purpose is to reproduce the image of God to bring forth Jesus Christ again that's her responsibility that's why we can see with such a beautiful type and Ruth how she brings forth that child she brings forth that that seed and then that seed is introduced to the - Naomi which is a type of a juice this bride must bring forth Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because that's what the woman is for now when we look at we're looking at that word in order to understand what's being finished and when the original word was marred it identifies how that word is being completed today so if something was interrupted but it's gonna be finished today if we look at the interruption then we can understand what needs to be continued if we look how it was changed then identifies how it's gonna be brought back to the original to fulfill the original and brother Branham says in spoken words the original seed notice what happened to Eve's children the first one that was born God said multiplied to his bride to add a bride replenish multiply and replenish the earth that was God's commission and she would have done it and he would mixing themselves together but what happened when Adam got ready to come to her she was already a mother I'm quoting spoken words the original seed this is what brother Branham said that she would have done it and he would have done it and through some means of mixing themselves together but when he got ready to come to her she was already found with seed impregnated an brother Branham says it this way Adams bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply replenish the earth it was an oncoming thing a promise so it was an oncoming promise that under a certain time in a certain season they would come together under the Word of God and she would bring forth the child he says it was on coming but she didn't wait she was not his wife and now he's using a language to suggest there's a further consummation or unfolding an expression of this relationship she was not his wife as of yet because he had not lived with her he says she got in a hurry and what did she do now listen tell you this is I'm not saying this I'm just gonna stay just stay with how he said it let the Holy Spirit kind of amplify these things to you and connect these things together he says she got in a hurry what did she do she crossed her seed she mingled it with the serpent seed she brought a child of death and she perverted every child after that so even any subsequent conception by Adam perverts everything that comes forward because she got in a hurry and shifted the time frame and now it's no longer the man and a woman according to God's timing according to God's Word but it has now dropped down into a death sentence and and a carnal unfolding of recreation so it says here let me take this these handkerchiefs he says here is a man that was supposed to be right here this is a man that was supposed to be what happened Eve hybrid it read it and what it did well then what did it do it turned to death and just keep dying so then he says and here stays the word just the same here's the word lain here just the same now what happened now there's a man that comes forth but he's hybrid so he dies but now brother BAM says the word of Genesis 1:28 he says it just lays here it's not in that man that's been recreated he's not in that man that's born of the woman he is laying in here this commandment slain he says what happened here's the word the word that God spoke to multiply replenish the earth it couldn't find a place to land so now what we've done is we've identified the promise that's unfinished that the man and the woman did not finish this part of the commandment because that word never found a place to land it never came into the womb he says multiply and replenish it couldn't find a place to land and it's beautiful when you think about multiply and replenish earth be fruitful and it being fruitful you're going to multiply and so through multiplication it's a reproduction of the the original and it produces but then it says be fruitful multiply and then replenish the earth that means to be full or accomplished accomplish the purpose of the earth replenish it - it's in fulfil accomplished or complete the purpose of the earth so God had envisioned in the beginning that there would be sons and daughters of God that would come forth by the word and they never fulfilled that commandment but there will be a people understand on earth in this hour who through the body will come forth the finished seed of God's original purpose do you realise what a promise this means and I just want to say this I with great inspiration don't desire just a child but desire a child of God because that's what we bring forth in this hour is not mere progeny after the flesh but it is our promise in this hour that we bring four sons and daughters of God sorry so it's to be replenish and if I could put it this way the great purpose of God was left pregnant in the earth and I needn't so and then he left man and woman to finish it he wanted he said now I've commanded you I've given you all the means at the appointed time your to bring forth your to reproduce but she gets out of step and she gets too far ahead of God's program and it changes everything I'm brother Branham that teaches us that the first as I mentioned a moment ago the first son Adam was a spoken seed Word of God and he was given a word bride to reproduce himself and that's what she was given to him for to produce another son of God he says but she fell by hybridization she caused him to die that's what the first Adam and the first woman did under commandment a commandment that's never fulfilled so what they do actually brings us into a hybrid of reproduction and it causes mankind to die now that's the first Adam then the second Adam Christ is given a wife right that church is born on the day of Pentecost she is a spoken-- she is a spoken-- seed word give to Christ just like Adam was but before Christ could marry her she also Falls that's what brother branham taught us so just as the woman was given to Adam and they never reproduced according to commandment God gives Christ a bride but before he says he couldn't marry her she had also fallen so that means there's even a purpose to the woman that was left unsatisfied because there'd never been a union so when brother Branham preaches the invisible union of the bride to Christ and says the marriage takes place here all there ought to be a shout and a hallelujah to realize what God has done today has never been done before for the Benham says in future home now that you could think deep about this he says then what happened he said Adam and Eve here on earth and said multiply now and replenish the earth their bodies was all laid out here for you to eat and make your body that's the way that he had of doing it but sin come along and interrupted his plan she rolls right on just the same time does so God had this plan of how this would unfold but then Satan comes in and my sin here interrupts his plan so once the plan is interrupted and now it's been hybrid and she's fallen the woman has fallen Adam cannot finish the commandment then we're told that the same thing happens once the church comes forth and before he could have an invisible union with her she has also fallen so the original purpose cannot be completed in the church so now do you realize even more what it means when the originals restored in this hour and the the Alpha bride has become an Omega bride it's not just so that we can act like the original but we can finish the original so then once the original has fallen when he speaks the curse to the serpent he says i'll put enmity between thee and the woman genesis 3:15 and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this is a prophecy of the restoration of that word because now when he says that the seed of the woman her seed there'll be enmity between thy seed and her seed the I seed is a hybrid seed that the whole the whole populated has been populated by fallen man and so he's not talking about a literal seed gene on earth where we have to do all these DNA tests and we all subscribe to 23andme and hey guess what it came back I go right back to Adam no that's not the way that this works but he's going to do something new and Christ is going to be a new creation he's going to be the beginning of the creation of God not just Adams race patched up but it's going to be something new to unfold it's and it's going to be through that that there's redemption to Adams race but it's a it's this prophecy is a restoration of that word because genesis 3:15 is the seed of Genesis 1:28 he revives the original plan and the original purpose of God because when Christ comes he comes as a new creation he comes as the son of God he comes as the last Adam - what revived the original commandment bring back up what was in the beginning and restored back to man everything that had been lost in the fall and now they be there's a a beautiful type that we can see in here before Adam could come to the woman the II Eve had been be guided by the serpent but now when Kirk God is going to foreshadow the rib the redemption of Genesis 1:28 before Joseph comes to Mary she had already received seed from God brother man says the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the Virgin so think of the dynamics and the mechanics now the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifested he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the Virgin now what was he foreshadowing the bringing forth of the bridegroom to be able to fulfill the original purpose of bridegroom bride in a garden of eden' so then he says I'm the word here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it wasn't married that means it's the word of promise that he himself is to be made manifest God is to be made manifest he himself has acted at his time to fulfill his word of promise in the virgin bride here is the secret the word is in the bride why because it's the woman that came out of that man and God had to bring forth a man apart from human instrumentality had to bring forth the Son of God apart from man apart from woman apart from Adam's race apart from any of the gene or blood of those of those who had the hybrid creatures and he brought forth the Virgin born son of God who is the very DNA of God why there had to be a bride man in order for there to be a bride woman Jesus Christ was the restoration of the original bridegroom and the bride is the restoration of the original woman and now he says the word is in the bride as it was in Mary so Mary reflects something she doesn't fulfill it completely or perfectly she reflects something the word is in the bride as it was in Mary what it married is she gave birth to the son of God so if the word is in the bride is it wasn't Mary you've got to give birth I've been thinking about the Cova 19 right now I caught a revelation of what the 19 is it's the 19 pounds I gained over the last three months and so my youngest jackal put his hands on my belly in he's like man you're getting big and you know he's thinking I'm pregnant now and you know what we are we're expecting wow we're gonna do the full word is delivered through this bride how good wonderful I've got plenty of time now in the super sign I just want to read these statements just to nail this down very very tight but the man says God the great contractor had laid all had all the bodies laid out here on earth of calcium Potter's patrolling he was going to create it and make it but she bypassed the way of God what did Adam do when he come to his wife when he calmed her he found her pregnant of an evil conception had received foul seed now we can all accept that about the woman right who is now later named Eve after she conceived and became the mother of all living not necessarily as the crown of righteousness but a crown of unrighteousness and that wasn't that wasn't to be that wasn't a righteous designation for her at that time and we could accept that about the woman but listen to how profound brother Branham now applies this to Christ Jehovah before he could marry his wife did the same thing and Jesus before he could get to his bride she had organized herself and become the Roman Catholic Church same thing that's heavy that I mean that is that as a prophet bringing it into these terms that you want to be very careful to stay behind these designations in these qualifications but just as the first woman had fallen the first church and all her glory and all her splendor and everything that she was she had also fallen before he could marry her so there was a further expression of the relationship of Christ to his bride that was not fulfilled in the Alpha but will be fulfilled in the Omega oh I thank God that I'm here on earth bringing this to pass before Jesus could get to his bride should organized herself but he will have a bride don't you worry that will be bought with his word just exactly what he told Eve to stay with he will have a church amen that will be bought by his word he will have a bride that will bring forth the entire Word of God in its fullest he will have a bride that often stay faithful to the commandment he will finally have a woman that fulfills the Commission he will have a bride there's been many churches churches Brides Brides but there must come one he says an invisible union a woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile a woman is trusted to that there's not a creature on earth like a woman there's no female dog no female of any kind entrusted with the character that a woman is a woman was not even in the beginning of the creation because God node that she would fall now I realize it's a paradox God simply made it that way now if it could help you God knew that she would fall he knew that that woman would fall but he also knew you wouldn't all other females could not commit adultery she's the only one that can commit adultery if she had been like the original that would have been disk complementary to God's great wisdom in other words if she had not been placed on the basis that she could fall that would have not been a complement to God's plan or purpose in the wisdom he had because he wanted to express attributes didn't he say that God had to predestinate a man who required salvation or in order to give him purpose and reason of being so if he had placed him on the basis that they would never fall God would have been lacking in fulfillment so he says if she'd been like the original that would have not complemented God's great wisdom she was a byproduct of man he says but because she was cashed over in that side now if I could express it this way because she was cast in that role because she was asked to play that part the woman was put on the basis that she I tell you it just moves me she was placed on the basis that she would play the part of a harlot and she acted in that as if she was moved upon and she was defiled and she allowed herself to be defiled and we viewed the woman has been evil and acting with great perversion and she's been deceived but it was as if she was asked to play that part and played that role so that Adams something could be brought out of Adam so that once we see it portrayed in Adam we would know that our bridegroom would do the same thing for us but even though we might have come fallen even though we might have sinned in Kavala short of the glory of God and even though we'd beat before we ever intended to do evil before we had ever formed our lips to speak alive we were condemned by her birth but that God would have a plan of redemption for us and she was driven to play the part of a harlot and we realize all we could cast her to the side and we could speak evil things of Eve but all in the same way that she was asked to play the part of the harlot you are cast in the role of a queen and you are cast in the role of such a queen that you would not be defiled but you would remain pure and I can't we cannot take credit and we cannot say oh I made a good decision I made a great decision but there's a Redemption that's pursuing you and there's a love that's covering you and there's a power that's catching you in that role of a virgin and you just have to be yielded to it praise be to God he says but because she was cast over in that side she has also been given a sacred charge from God for redemption even the woman I'm gonna let you play the part of a harlot because I'm gonna let my bride play the part of a wife I'm gonna let her play the part I'm gonna cast her as the faithful woman I'm gonna give her the role and I'm gonna give her the privilege of being the faithful woman who cannot fall who will not defile herself who will stay faithful and because the woman was allowed to play that part in the fall he has allowed his wife to be given a sacred charge for redemption that means the bride has a divine responsibility a sacred charge a divine responsibility God has a given you a duty a duty given by God for the purpose of glorifying God and satisfying his need and giving him purpose God has given her a sacred charge for redemption the woman has a special place in bringing the fullness of redemption now this is where this is where it gets a little bit of complet gets a little bit complicated because there's some that want to they want to glorify Christ to such a degree that they want to tear down the bride but Christ cannot bring the fullness of redemption without his wife because she's part of it so he's given her a sacred charge if the first Adam could not replenish without the woman neither can Christ bring this to its fulfillment in its completion without you through her will the completion of God the completion of what God foreshadowed in the garden we accomplished through her he'll do it through her will be the fulfillment of the original brother brems says in spoken words the original seed God came in flesh to give us another birth to bring us back to original sons and daughters of God there you are he says the life sperm of Eden never happened it never did she mingled it kept it away instead of Adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be how do you have that image in your mind of Adam and the woman bringing forth children according to the original commandment that word was never fulfilled now with that image in mind he says just like Christ would have come to the group Christ would have come to his church he promised to do it God promised to multiply but they had to wait until God's time and if I could say this the time has arrived this is God's time to fulfill this this is God's time to complete it the time is now this is the specific time to complete what has not been completed the old testament prefigures Jesus Christ and a foreshadowed Christ and it culminates in the perfect expression of the bridegroom and the New Testament prefigures the Bride of Christ and it culminates in the perfect expression of the bride brother Ram says as Noah Moses David reflected the coming of this perfect bridegroom so as Luther Wesley and Pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride and here she is with the sacred charge full Redemption do you realize this is why we don't play Church do you know why you have so passionately desired a pastor not so that you could play church but because you realize it's part of God's dynamics and mechanics and dynamics of God's program to bring the bride to rapture in faith and to bring her to a place of the full expression of God that's why you have this passion not because we play Church if we wanted to play church go find anyone go anywhere sit under anything that's all you need is the trappings and you need all the the church order listen I think that's what's happened if co D has become OCD because we leave the word out of it and listen the whole purpose of this the mechanics and dynamics of this is there will be a bride that will bring forth the entire Word of God in its fullness and I'm not playing Church and I'm not simply happy with the resemblance of church I am the bride that isn't an intimate relationship with the word and I want to avail myself to God's program brother Branham says in Christ is the mystery of who God revealed the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by accepting what Eve turned down what did she turn down the privilege of reproducing the son she never did it the privilege of reproducing the son and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word of spirit anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept who was those deals Christ he comes back and we accept see how that hybrid condition again just exactly what he'd done Eve he told he don't you do this and don't you do that and you can do this and you can do that and Satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but the eve in the last days is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it i let's not take any credit why won't you fall why won't you walk away you guys have had a lot of time to think about this why haven't you quit you predestinated not - she's predestinated not to do it yes sir god's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said the church would be there without spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest she will accept what Eve turned down what is he saying god of this evil age that God would call out of people out of this evil age for he says she has made manifest being tried been proven proved - Satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end and he talks about Malachi 4 restores back the original faith so he says we find out this evil a just to prove to Satan can you finish the statement she is not like Eve this won't be left unfinished she is not that type of a woman she will be tried by his word the bride as Adams bride was tried by the word and Adams bride believed every bit of the word all confused but on one promise that he's the same yesterday today forever failed on one promise under temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she has to come and contact again by the same thing face to face with Christ this so that she can withstand face to face with the enemy she's to come in contact again by the same thing not by denominational truth or something but by every word the bride fulfills in brown even says it this way in Chapter one of the church age book Adam Eve were in the garden and did not finish out the thousand years now Jesus our last Adam and his Eve the true church will fulfill all the plan of God not just a thousand years but through his bride the last Adam and the true church will fulfill all the plan of God but the brennaman choosing of a bride says the bride he's referring to the bride and about the bride he says this quoting is pregnant by the Word of God and will bring forth the finished body of Jesus Christ the bride is pregnant with the Word of God and being pregnant she will give birth to the finished body of Jesus Christ because he says the two together make the one body again like it was at the beginning like it was it was supposed to be at the beginning the musicians if you would come and you can just feel the adrenaline rush through the congregation and spoken words the original seed she's told to pick up the pin and write and then he writes it this way in the church age book here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species fourth of it after its own kind and even according to Genesis 111 and God said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit the very same law applies to the church today so it's not just reproducing the plant it's reproducing the fruit whatever was in the seed whatever the seed started the church will come forth whatever life was in the seed come forth and the plant infants in the fruit the very same law law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it's the same seed in these last days the true bride church Christ seen will come to the headstone and she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him then the bride will be so much like him they will be in his very image this is unorder to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their Creed's their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrel isin brings a hybrid bread product I know some of you think of brother Aaron you could have just read this quote in the beginning we could have called a prayer line because it says it just is saying it exactly the first son Adam was the spoken seed Word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God but she fell fell by hybridization she caused him to die the son second son Jesus also a spoken seed Word of God was given a bride like as was Adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen look at the image that's being created look at how he's bringing this image before it's over no girl she like Adams wife was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died but remember your to prove that you're not like Eve now you're not that type of a woman so he says from a little group of the true seed of the word of God God will present Christ with the beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creed's or dogmas then catch the revelation of this statement by and through the members of the bride raise your hand if you're a member of that body by and through you individually will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin hallelujah you are fulfilling the original by and through you will he satisfy his purpose and he will fulfill the purity the sanctity to holiness the righteousness the very purpose of the woman in the beginning that's why there had to be an invisible Union his pion through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin because you will fulfill all the plan of God can you say thank you Lord and you thank God that we had a prophet that came and diligently and faithfully with great intention I realized that sometimes we we like to think that maybe brother Branham was just innocently saying things and just accidentally saying this but he was a man that had been so broken and losing his wife and his daughter and losing so much and suffering so much to even come to a place in the very middle of his ministry and right back rush started again and God gives him this great vision and he realizes that there's the first pull a second pull and then the third pull but when it comes to that third pull you just say exactly what I tell you to say and so he knew I can't explain this too much III can't try to interpret this so he had to stay faithful to preach it and just say it exactly as he told him to say it and I believe he used great restraint but also great inspiration to try to preach the revelation of Jesus Christ so that we could recognize that what you have the privilege on this hour of receiving it's something that God has looked forward to from the very moment that he said that there be and if that is what God had in his mind when he said let there be then I say beard under me being under me o God if this is the great climax this is the great culmination then be it unto me according to thy word let's stand to our feet well thank you God oh thank you lord if you said let it be that be it unto me let that be your anchor tonight listen I know I am going to be turning it over to brother Aaron as as he he feels this unction of the Lord I listen brother Branham took great pains to express that the success of the first poll was because it was in the word the success of the second polls because it was in the word and the success of the third poll is because it's the full word perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication so when you come when you meet the Lord on the basis of his word that's where you're placing your faith not in the hand of a man not in the mechanics of a line but you're recognizing that this is something that God will meet my faith in this moment and for this need and so we're not just we're not playing Church we're not just fantasizing about some kind of supernatural but I'm gonna let it be an act of faith not fanaticism not emotionalism not any kind of former pattern but I'm going to come and faith believing that I am his son buying his daughter and that he loves me and he's taking great care for me and listen if I could say it this way God is happy to prove his word God is happy to confirm the coming for his elect time and time and time again meet him on the basis of his word he will back up this word and this word that were facing the completion of today he will back it up tonight take him out his word don't come from a position of weakness but a position of confidence that this is what God promised us bow our heads I'll just say word of prayer just to finish my part could you say be it unto me according to thy word let it be Lord let it be let me tour take my place in the completion of this word a gracious Heavenly Father I pray Lord for these people have a very very deep love for brother Perry green [Music] very deep love for brother Matthew Watkins and tremendous friendship that I have with him and what I have a love for your people I desire Lord to draw them close to your bosom now or comfort their hearts and their despondency Lord in their disillusionment and their failed expectations Lord and they they not forget the love that you have for them and the great care that you're taking with their lives so they'll be able to stand one day with your word my faith and faith alone because it's gonna take a bride that's been tested and tried and proven she's not like Eve to be able to stare down that last enemy and say with an assurance death you cannot have me so I prayed tonight Lord you let our faith accumulate to believe all things are possible and I say now Lord bless your people pray that you would comfort them give them the desires of their heart and be with them and feed them on lead them to new things Lord and an unfolding word there be rivers of water that refreshed them in this desert may they fear no more Lord may you be their portion I pray we commit them to you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a court died [Music] according to [Music] I can stand [Music] Oh [Music] the word [Music] let's see him in the bride age understanding the word for this moment in this hour whoa [Music] Oh [Music] nor that start saying it security I can't stand [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] just sing with a little bit more inspiration understanding me Oh ba da [Music] according to your promise I can stand [Music] impart upon my the original see Oh according to know Oh [Music] for heart of assurance god bless you we love you Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] according to [Music] [Applause] they'll just be seated for for a few moments brother Aaron I'm on went to catch his breath till brother branham saw them going into that little room there were some with you know missing limbs and different things and they were coming out of their hole and and some of you have some physical ailments some of you have some mental issues some of you have some spiritual issues but each one of them came out whole God is not limited that sacrifice is provided for everything every meter supplying both both spiritual physical mental many times in the prayer line as brother branham addressed all the different things that were happening they all came from one spirit that's a spirit of Satan and every attribute that you need for healing comes from the Spirit of God it's all it's all included so it doesn't take any special faith or any special business taking part at his word God said you can move that mountain you can speak to that little tool and what is your motive say Lord because I want to fulfill that would you have me here for not for my glory but for your glory so I'm going to ask each one of you to come in line God knows I need you may not even be able to express it in words brother Branham would stand there now brother Branham used to wait for something he says you know what I'm waiting for it he'd just be talking and then he would say here he is let me tell you something here he is because he said he would be so if you can come under the same faith you can have what you guys without faith something that brother Branham said I said walk away now begin to thank the Lord and give him praise for the answer you walk away and say I didn't feel a thing watch out you could lose it right there but if you're walking when you say Lord exactly what I have me that you and I will begin to bridge would you do that tonight I don't know what your need is I know some of your needs you know we've prayed for you we know something put their things in your heart you're going through that we don't know but he knows so brother Aaron if you would he's young enough maybe if you would come down and in let's not let's not use the mic I'm brother Aaron there dad would you come up and stand with him I'm gonna just go ahead and stay seated right where you're at right now just just where you're at stay seated I want to do this in an orderly fashion I'm going to start from this side with brother Camus and then you just follow in line if we would and and God is going to do if you can believe you can walk out of here halt whatever it is so let's do [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] if you trust and we will sure take her [Music] I want to say I appreciate brother Aaron taking the time to minister to you it's different when you have a visiting Minister like this who doesn't know it may not be influenced by knowing you sometimes as a friend or a person close to you it's hard to look surpass certain things but I know when a brother's Minister he speaks and all sudden he'll begin to speak and pray over something that goes directly to your heart and you know that wasn't anybody but God so let's stand as a group right now and let's just take a moment to thank him for what he did for us today Lord we just want to say we appreciate you we want to thank you for being mindful of us coming by and drawing close Lord and ministering to each part to each being here Lord in what their need is sometimes we can't even put it in words or explain what what we have need of Lord but you know best and we want to say thank you Lord we want to say we love you Lord and tomorrow Lord as it comes in the morning and the day goes through Lord and maybe we trip and fall and maybe we fail let us be reminded that you are mindful of us and you care for us let us stand up and say lord help me to go on and continue in this victory that you given me today
