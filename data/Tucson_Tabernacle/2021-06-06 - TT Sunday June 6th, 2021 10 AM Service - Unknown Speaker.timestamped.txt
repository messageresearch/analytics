[0:00] leading us along and you you encourage
[0:02] yourself that way
[0:03] you strengthen yourself that way you
[0:05] know the first time you do something and
[0:07] it didn't come out
[0:08] quite quite as well as maybe you saw the
[0:11] picture of
[0:13] um you take a look and said i want to
[0:16] recreate that
[0:17] but you know the second well i the
[0:19] second time you do it and for us it's
[0:21] two three four five times maybe
[0:22] for god it's the first time always but
[0:26] watch he says
[0:27] in the message proving his word
[0:32] he says god is his own interpreter
[0:36] do you know if we have those there
[0:39] when he promised he said let there be
[0:41] light and there was light and he said a
[0:44] virgin
[0:45] shall conceive and she did see whatever
[0:48] god says
[0:50] god proves it no matter how much you try
[0:54] to think
[0:55] the physical resurrection couldn't be
[0:59] and then people is back yonder just dust
[1:01] of the earth
[1:02] and past dust now they're just into
[1:06] acids and gases and their body was that
[1:09] their body was made of
[1:11] their soul is still living god said all
[1:14] raise it up
[1:14] job said though the skin worms destroys
[1:18] this body yet in my flesh i'll see god
[1:22] see no matter every word has got to be
[1:26] kept and man shall live by that word
[1:31] if god's word ever failed you you would
[1:33] lose your confidence
[1:36] but because it doesn't fail you can go
[1:38] back to it time
[1:39] and time and time again
[1:43] jehovah jireh
[1:47] he says don't look at yourself
[1:50] look at your lamb he says
[1:54] god don't accept you he accepted the
[1:56] lamb and the lamb took your place
[1:58] oh god can't you see it not you you're
[2:00] not worthy i'm not worthy
[2:02] there's none of us worthy but see
[2:05] is he worthy god said so he accepted him
[2:09] he said this
[2:10] is my beloved son in whom i am well
[2:12] pleased
[2:13] this is my son hear ye him on the day of
[2:16] the adoption
[2:17] this is him don't say well the doctor
[2:20] says i'll never get well
[2:22] that's what the doctor says now that man
[2:24] is a scientific man he looks
[2:27] he looks the way nature is running and
[2:29] he sees you can never be well
[2:31] that scientifically shows him about that
[2:35] well that's what he's looking at if you
[2:37] look at the same thing then you'll never
[2:39] be well
[2:40] but don't look at what he said don't
[2:41] look at what
[2:43] what how you're diminishing but look at
[2:45] your sacrifice
[2:46] that said and remember your abraham seed
[2:50] and heirs with him then if you are
[2:53] stay with the promise accept him as your
[2:55] inhaler
[2:56] just stay right there
[2:59] and then in expectations
[3:04] listen to this children the word of god
[3:06] will defeat satan
[3:08] anywhere any place on any condition any
[3:11] time
[3:13] any condition anywhere
[3:17] you might find yourself in your place
[3:18] where you think god won't listen to you
[3:22] god look where i'm at right now look
[3:23] where i've gotten myself you can't hear
[3:25] but
[3:25] the word of god tells us he will hear
[3:27] you
[3:29] he didn't say until you get to church
[3:30] and kneel down at the altar
[3:33] he says when you'll turn your heart back
[3:35] towards him
[3:36] he says
[3:40] when jesus was here he was god and god
[3:42] was in christ reconciling the world to
[3:44] himself
[3:46] but he never used any of his gifts when
[3:49] he met satan he brought the kingdom of
[3:51] god so low till the weakest of chris
[3:53] christians can use it when satan come to
[3:56] him
[3:56] and said if thou be the son of god
[3:59] command these stones
[4:00] he said it is written the word
[4:03] he took him up and tried to whitewash
[4:05] your word for him and jesus said it is
[4:07] also written he took him up to the top
[4:10] of the mountain and said
[4:11] he had to look at all the kingdoms i
[4:13] will give them to you
[4:14] if you'll worship me jesus said it is
[4:17] written there it is
[4:19] and it is risen whatsoever things you
[4:21] desire when you pray
[4:23] believe you receive it and you shall
[4:25] have it
[4:26] then defeat defeat satan with the word
[4:28] of god
[4:30] you know they're easy to read these
[4:32] words and get inspired but
[4:33] how about putting him into action you
[4:36] know
[4:37] one more here
[4:43] the word became flesh from the india
[4:45] trip report
[4:48] he says now of the same spirit that said
[4:50] let there be light
[4:51] and there was light that said let there
[4:54] be trees and there was trees
[4:56] and if that same mine that was in christ
[4:59] being you
[5:00] how much could it say let there be no
[5:03] cancer
[5:04] and it would be gone let the blind eyes
[5:07] be opened and it would be so
[5:08] see it's your thought jesus it verily
[5:12] said you
[5:12] you said that was jesus but wait a
[5:15] minute he said
[5:16] have faith in god for verily verily i
[5:19] say unto you
[5:20] if ye shall say to this mountain be
[5:22] moved plucked up and cast into the sea
[5:25] and don't doubt in your heart but
[5:27] believe that which you
[5:29] say will come to pass you will have
[5:31] whatever
[5:32] things thou sayst is that right
[5:35] you shall have it not me you shall have
[5:38] it
[5:40] it's easy to put it on somebody else
[5:41] it's easy to put it on the minister it's
[5:43] easy to put it on the prophet
[5:45] it's easy to put it on this preacher or
[5:47] pastor but you need it
[5:50] you need it when you're by yourself you
[5:52] need it when you're facing the things
[5:53] out there where you're at
[5:55] and he's a christ jesus christ the same
[5:57] yesterday today and forever
[5:59] what power has been given to the church
[6:02] now you can express it by mental
[6:04] conception but if it becomes a
[6:06] real revelation of god that you see be
[6:09] see it before it happen and express it
[6:11] in word form
[6:13] that word takes a whole and becomes a
[6:14] material a thought expressed
[6:16] oh my how god see it your heart your
[6:20] mind is so and filled with god's spirit
[6:23] until your thoughts become his thoughts
[6:24] amen there you are
[6:26] when your mind and your leading and your
[6:29] guiding becomes a direct place or a
[6:31] direct
[6:32] inspiration of the holy spirit that's
[6:34] moving through your mortal being
[6:36] when you're looking at the situation and
[6:39] your words want to say
[6:40] i can't but that one inside you says get
[6:43] up and go
[6:45] stand up take god at his word and move
[6:48] forward
[6:50] and this body begins to be subject to
[6:53] that
[6:54] and watch god move and then you hear
[6:57] that's my daughter
[6:58] that's my son hear ye them
[7:02] he's jesus christ the same yesterday
[7:04] today and forever and how is he
[7:05] manifesting himself
[7:07] through his body through his bride
[7:11] so again in exodus he says i am that i
[7:14] am
[7:14] now let's just look at a couple of the
[7:16] promises or the things that god told
[7:19] the old testament saints them you know
[7:22] we're the
[7:22] the spiritual seed of abraham so the
[7:24] promises he gave to them
[7:26] are ours also okay so genesis
[7:29] we're going to read some out of genesis
[7:30] here the seed chapter let's see book
[7:34] chapter 9 and we'll verses read verses
[7:36] 12 to 17.
[7:40] and god said this is a token of the
[7:43] covenant which i made between me
[7:45] and you and every living creature that
[7:47] is with you
[7:48] for perpetual generations i do set my
[7:52] bone
[7:53] in in the wreck in the cloud and it
[7:55] shall be for a token
[7:57] of a covenant between me and the earth
[8:00] and it shall come to pass when i bring a
[8:02] cloud over the earth
[8:03] and that bow shall be seen in the clouds
[8:07] and i will remember my covenant which is
[8:10] between me and you
[8:11] and every living creature of all flesh
[8:14] and the water shall
[8:15] no more become a flood to destroy all
[8:17] flesh
[8:19] and the bow will be in the cloud and i
[8:21] will look upon it that i may remember
[8:23] the everlasting covenant between god and
[8:25] every living creature of all flesh that
[8:27] is upon the earth
[8:29] and god said unto noah this is the token
[8:31] of the covenant
[8:32] which i have established between me and
[8:35] all flesh
[8:36] that is upon the earth how many has ever
[8:39] seen a rainbow
[8:41] how many does that remind him of jim
[8:43] that's god's promise
[8:45] and he's faithful to his word it's a
[8:47] natural thing that he put up there
[8:49] he said you look at that and i remind
[8:52] yourself that i
[8:54] will keep my word i will keep my promise
[8:59] oh but that was for noah no he said to
[9:01] all
[9:03] that includes me that includes you
[9:06] genesis 17
[9:08] 19
[9:15] and god said sarah thy wife shall bear
[9:18] thee a son indeed
[9:20] and thou shall call his name isaac and i
[9:23] will establish my covenant with him
[9:26] for an everlasting covenant and with his
[9:29] seed after him
[9:32] now if you've heard the news recently
[9:35] isaac seed is still there they're still
[9:38] a country
[9:39] they're still a people and god is still
[9:42] with them
[9:44] i i saw something in the news the other
[9:46] day that
[9:47] some of the uh in the the seven or eight
[9:51] days of the
[9:51] the bombing and all they were talking
[9:55] the uh on the uh
[9:59] hamas and them they were mentioning that
[10:03] obviously they got somebody on their
[10:04] side
[10:06] because over over these these years we
[10:09] were they've said even it seems like
[10:10] that the bombs will be coming and
[10:11] they'll turn down the street and then
[10:13] they'll turn down the street and they'll
[10:14] go right to the building where they're
[10:15] supposed to hit like somebody's driving
[10:17] them
[10:17] well let me tell you there is somebody
[10:18] driving them
[10:20] he watches over his children
[10:23] and he keeps his word because if he
[10:25] doesn't keep his word
[10:27] then we're all in trouble but he says
[10:30] i will establish my covenant with him
[10:33] for an
[10:34] everlasting covenant and with the seed
[10:36] after him
[10:38] genesis 32
[10:44] sorry
[10:46] genesis 32 24-29
[10:52] and jacob was left alone and there was a
[10:56] and there wrestled a man with him until
[10:58] the breaking of the day
[11:00] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[11:02] against him he touched the hollow of his
[11:04] thigh
[11:04] and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out
[11:06] of joint as he wrestled with him
[11:09] and he said let me go for the day
[11:11] breaketh and he said i will not let thee
[11:14] go
[11:14] except thou bless me
[11:17] if jacob could do that so can you
[11:22] if god comes and you say i am not going
[11:25] to
[11:26] until you bless me i will not back off
[11:31] i will not just say okay lord i'm going
[11:34] to stay here
[11:40] until
[11:44] and he said unto him what is thy name
[11:47] and he said jacob
[11:49] and he said thy name shall be called
[11:52] no more jacob but israel.
[11:56] for as a prince has thou power with god
[11:59] and with men and hast prevailed
[12:04] and jacob asked him and said tell me i
[12:07] pray thee thy name
[12:08] and he said where is it that thou thus
[12:10] aster my name
[12:12] and he blessed them there he says that
[12:15] the prince of god
[12:17] thou has prevailed remember when daniel
[12:21] was seeking god he's reading in here and
[12:23] he says i see where jeremiah said
[12:25] 70 years and he begins to seek god
[12:30] and of daniel and i know daniel was
[12:32] human
[12:33] and he began to wonder after the second
[12:35] and third day that there seemed to be no
[12:37] answer
[12:39] until the angel of the lord comes by and
[12:41] says i came down but i was
[12:43] withheld i i was with steward withstood
[12:46] by satan and his angels
[12:48] but god had already sent an answer
[12:52] god has an answer for you god has heard
[12:55] your requests
[12:56] god has already made provision
[13:00] but he knows the perfect timing for it
[13:02] all
[13:05] we uh we've learned that as as
[13:09] as parents or now as grandparents at
[13:13] the timing of things in in the
[13:17] um in the raising of the character of
[13:20] children of ourselves
[13:22] learning to wait learning to be patient
[13:26] not getting everything you want just
[13:27] because you want it when you want it
[13:29] but god knows best for us and they that
[13:32] wade upon the lord
[13:34] shall renew their strength
[13:37] because when you get it when when you
[13:39] get what you want when you want it you
[13:41] really never develops a good character
[13:43] you become
[13:44] spoiled you become um
[13:48] oh god i was gonna say spoiled brat but
[13:52] that's me all right okay just understand
[13:55] the character and the nature of god it
[13:57] takes time
[13:58] it's a molding it's a shaping
[14:02] you know it's i remember brother ed
[14:04] sending us
[14:05] a um a video that he had seen about a
[14:09] a man that that works with clay
[14:12] and um and he's shaping and he's molding
[14:15] and
[14:15] he's working with that clay as he's
[14:17] talking he's demonstrating it
[14:20] and he purposely takes some of the clay
[14:22] and he lets it
[14:24] off to the side quite un unfinished or
[14:26] you just think it isn't
[14:28] and he works on another piece and he
[14:29] goes and the four or five pieces that he
[14:32] sets down
[14:33] seem to dry up and they're somewhat
[14:36] disfigured they're not the best looking
[14:38] pieces of pottery there or whatever he
[14:40] was shaping
[14:42] and and the place is full it's it's it's
[14:44] a uh
[14:46] like a a classroom that he's doing and
[14:48] he's just not paying attention to it
[14:51] and then he stops and he goes now those
[14:54] pieces there that look unfinished
[14:57] he picks one up and he puts it back on
[15:00] the the potter's table there
[15:04] and he begins to get a little moisture
[15:05] work back into it and he begins to
[15:07] reshape it
[15:08] and he begins to work it again and he
[15:11] turns and he shows now
[15:13] what he intended with it and i'm glad
[15:16] god does the same thing with us
[15:19] sometimes it seems lord i i don't seem
[15:21] to be where i should be
[15:23] but god's not finished with me yet
[15:31] and as we go to genesis 35
[15:37] and another another part that he deals
[15:40] with jacob
[15:42] 9-13 and god appeared unto jacob again
[15:45] and he came out of
[15:47] when he came out of pen
[15:50] pat anaram and blessed him and god said
[15:53] unto him
[15:54] thy name is jacob thy name shall not be
[15:57] called jacob anymore but
[15:58] israel shall be thy name and he called
[16:02] his name israel
[16:06] now let's go on to the next and god said
[16:08] unto him i am god almighty
[16:10] be fruitful and multiply a nation
[16:13] and a company of nations shall be of
[16:16] thee and
[16:17] king shall come out of thy loins and the
[16:19] land which i gave
[16:21] abraham and isaac to thee will i give it
[16:24] and to thy seed after thee will i give
[16:27] the land
[16:29] and verse 13 give therefore
[16:33] so maybe i jump one one too many
[16:37] and god went up from him in that place
[16:40] where he
[16:40] talked with him he said to you
[16:44] i will give this because i've already
[16:47] made that promise
[16:50] but in giving that promise and meeting
[16:52] with jacob he changes his nature
[16:56] he changes his character his way of
[16:58] being
[17:00] the old man begins to fade away and the
[17:02] new man begins to be expressed
[17:05] the one who is now growing in christ the
[17:08] one who is now
[17:09] experiencing god and is beginning to
[17:11] grow
[17:13] and you're beginning to see a
[17:14] christ-like nature in that person
[17:18] and how is that expressed with the big
[17:20] halo on their head
[17:23] in the way they dress yes that's part of
[17:26] it
[17:28] but really the character is the actions
[17:31] taken
[17:32] that's what is heard most that's what is
[17:34] read most uh
[17:36] the reaction to an action
[17:39] disappointing news how do they react to
[17:41] disappointing news
[17:44] how do they react when god says no to
[17:46] them
[17:47] how do they react when it seems like the
[17:50] brother the sister is preferred what is
[17:52] the nature and their character of them
[17:56] god bless my brother god bless my sister
[17:59] i'm glad
[18:00] god is using them what a blessing for
[18:02] them or do they still go back and sit
[18:05] i'm better than them i prayed more no
[18:09] the nature has began to change
[18:12] jacob is israel he's no longer a cheat
[18:15] he's no longer a supplanter
[18:17] he's now a prince with god
[18:21] changing my heart oh god continue to
[18:24] work that nature with me
[18:27] this is the things that god said and we
[18:30] still
[18:30] see them today and they not failed
[18:35] i really like this one and
[18:40] makes it sound like i didn't like the
[18:41] other ones but no i like them all
[18:44] first kings chapter 3
[18:48] verse read verses 9 to 12.
[18:52] this is speaking of solomon god had
[18:56] given
[18:56] prop made david a promise he says
[18:59] they'll always be
[19:02] through the line of david there'll
[19:03] always be a king
[19:06] in your line and here's solomon
[19:09] solomon is now raised up and god has
[19:12] told solomon
[19:13] you can have anything you want
[19:17] it's yours and here's solomon as he
[19:19] looks over
[19:20] the people of israel and this is what he
[19:22] tells the lord give therefore thy
[19:24] servant
[19:25] an understanding heart to judge thy
[19:27] people
[19:29] that i may discern between good and bad
[19:32] for who is able to judge this
[19:34] thy so great a people i like the way he
[19:37] addresses it give thy servant
[19:39] because that's who i am i'm your servant
[19:42] you're not a servant to me god i'm a
[19:44] servant to you he says
[19:47] give me an understanding to judge thy
[19:49] people
[19:50] these are the children of god he says
[19:53] that i may discern between good and bad
[19:56] for who is able to judge
[19:58] this thy again
[20:01] so greater people they're yours god and
[20:03] the speech
[20:04] praised the lord that solomon had asked
[20:08] these things it pleased god to see that
[20:12] solomon would say lord
[20:14] i'm go you said ask therefore i'm going
[20:16] to ask you
[20:18] you said to speak therefore i'm going to
[20:20] speak
[20:24] let's finish that up
[20:30] it was just a 12. all right
[20:34] and god said to him because thou has
[20:37] asked this thing
[20:38] and has not asked for thyself long life
[20:41] neither has asked riches for thyself nor
[20:44] has asked
[20:46] the ask the life of thine enemies but
[20:48] has asked for thyself
[20:50] understanding to discern judgment behold
[20:53] i have done according to thy words
[20:56] again i have done according to thy words
[20:59] lo
[21:00] i have given thee a wise and
[21:02] understanding heart so that there is
[21:04] none like thee before thee neither after
[21:06] thee shall
[21:07] any arise like unto thee you get to a
[21:10] place
[21:11] as a christian as the bride of christ
[21:15] that your nature and your character has
[21:17] been changed god is not afraid of what
[21:18] you're going to ask
[21:19] and say because you're going to be like
[21:23] solomon
[21:24] you're going to say give me an
[21:25] understanding heart give me a spirit
[21:28] that is mellow that is sweet that is
[21:30] humble
[21:31] give me an attitude in a way that i'm
[21:32] going to love my brethren i'm going to
[21:34] love the sisters and i'm going to care
[21:35] for the lost one
[21:38] and it's okay what happens i don't have
[21:41] to have the new car i don't have to have
[21:42] the nice in place as long as i have you
[21:44] lord
[21:47] this world is not my home i'm just a
[21:49] passing through
[21:51] my treasures are laid up somewhere on
[21:53] the other side
[21:57] now we go we'll take let's look at some
[22:00] of the things that jesus said
[22:04] i i thought this interesting
[22:08] in saint john chapter 8
[22:11] verse 58.
[22:15] i'm just taking you know the story that
[22:18] goes with these you know that
[22:19] what was it there but jesus said unto
[22:21] them verily verily i say unto you
[22:23] before abraham was i am
[22:27] he's still the i am he didn't say
[22:31] that was the character of back then he
[22:32] said it hasn't changed
[22:34] i still i am i'm a very present help in
[22:36] the time of trouble
[22:39] i am the one that supplies every one of
[22:41] your needs
[22:43] the i am is there
[22:46] a self-existing one
[22:49] mark 9 verse 23
[22:58] jesus said unto him if thou can't
[23:00] believe
[23:01] all things are possible to him that
[23:04] believeth
[23:06] that's god's word all jesus was ever
[23:09] going to say
[23:09] with what the scripture ever said he was
[23:11] going to do and say it wasn't going to
[23:13] change
[23:15] all things are possible to him that
[23:17] believeth saint john
[23:20] 6 35
[23:23] and jesus said unto them i am the bread
[23:25] of life he that cometh to me shall never
[23:27] hunger
[23:28] and he that believeth on me shall never
[23:30] thirst
[23:32] that's not talking about a physical
[23:34] hunger and hunger and physical
[23:36] thirst it's talking about the satisfying
[23:38] portion for the inner man
[23:41] that job said though god slay me yet
[23:44] i'll trust them
[23:46] the three hebrew boys would say will not
[23:48] bow down to that image of daniel our
[23:50] brother
[23:51] will only bow to god no matter they
[23:54] weren't worried about the flesh
[23:57] saint john 11 23
[24:00] to 27 jesus said go on
[24:04] they had told them lazarus your friend
[24:07] is sick
[24:08] and jesus was too busy with other things
[24:10] that didn't bother him didn't care it
[24:12] seemed like
[24:13] your friend jesus peter might have
[24:16] tapped
[24:17] did you hear that jesus lazarus is sick
[24:20] jesus said it's okay it's okay
[24:23] and you know sometimes it might seem
[24:26] like that's he's doing that with you
[24:29] that it's okay it's all right just just
[24:30] hold on a little bit
[24:32] because he knows what's coming up he
[24:34] knows what's going to happen
[24:36] so he says so we know that he goes and
[24:39] and
[24:39] and martha and mary are there and they
[24:41] come out and they said had you been here
[24:42] our brother would not have died
[24:45] you know you would have healed him we've
[24:46] seen you do it over and over there's no
[24:48] question about it
[24:49] but then jesus says it unto her saith
[24:52] unto her
[24:52] thy brother shall rise again and martha
[24:54] said unto him i know that
[24:56] he shall rise again in the resurrection
[24:58] of the last day and jesus is standing
[25:00] right for him says
[25:01] i am the resurrection i am the
[25:04] resurrection and the life
[25:06] he that believeth in me though he were
[25:08] dead yet shall he live
[25:11] the woman at the well she hears
[25:13] something jesus says and he said
[25:15] hey we've been told that when the
[25:17] messiah comes
[25:18] he'll do these things and he goes yeah
[25:22] you're right when he comes and he walks
[25:23] away no he says i'm he
[25:26] i am he identifies himself the same
[25:29] every time
[25:31] when you're sick in your trouble and you
[25:32] say i've been told you're a healer he
[25:34] says i am
[25:37] without fail it's who i am
[25:40] i'm a very present time in the help of
[25:42] trouble in the very present
[25:44] help in the time of trouble i'll get it
[25:45] right she says
[25:48] and what's whosoever liveth and
[25:50] believeth me shall never die
[25:53] and he asked her do you believe this she
[25:54] has to answer she saith unto him
[25:56] yea lord i believe that thou art the
[25:58] christ
[25:59] the son of god which should come into
[26:02] the world
[26:03] and because i believe that i can take
[26:06] every promise
[26:07] that is written about you and stand on
[26:09] it
[26:11] every promise that god has said he'll
[26:13] keep it
[26:14] and you can stand on it
[26:21] now we'll get to to another part
[26:27] it's still jesus saying but he's telling
[26:29] you to speak
[26:31] for you to say matthew 5
[26:36] 18.
[26:38] for he says first for verily i say unto
[26:41] you
[26:41] till heaven and earth pass not one jot
[26:45] or one tittle shall in no wise pass from
[26:48] the law
[26:49] till all be fulfilled
[26:54] every promise everything said
[26:57] every scripture written through every
[27:00] prophet
[27:01] through every everything that david said
[27:03] in the psalms through all that jeremiah
[27:05] and isaiah
[27:06] said everything will come to pass
[27:11] without fail
[27:15] then again he says in matthew 6 25 and
[27:18] 26.
[27:20] therefore i say unto you take no thought
[27:22] for your life
[27:23] what you shall eat or what you shall
[27:26] drink nor yet for your body what you
[27:28] shall put on
[27:29] is not the life more than meat and the
[27:32] body more than raiment he says behold
[27:34] the fowls of the air
[27:36] for they sow not neither do they reap
[27:38] nor gather in two barns
[27:40] yet your heavenly father feedeth them
[27:43] are ye not much better than they
[27:48] in other words he says i value you
[27:52] more than that there is more value
[27:55] in you than that yet i take care of them
[28:02] okay so again he's speaking some words
[28:05] and you got you've got to catch him you
[28:06] gotta you gotta be able to put your name
[28:08] in there
[28:10] when everything seems to be going upside
[28:11] down he said wait a minute god you said
[28:13] you valued me more
[28:14] than that i i saw something the other
[28:18] day somebody posted and they were
[28:19] talking about
[28:20] god and and sometimes
[28:24] some people just have a way put things
[28:26] in words and it comes out means so much
[28:29] to you
[28:29] you you i sit down there with a pen and
[28:31] a paper and
[28:32] an hour later i have got two lines maybe
[28:35] and other people sit down and an hour
[28:37] later they got a book
[28:39] it's just they're able to express it and
[28:41] they're talking about god he said
[28:43] one is saying god seemed to be so
[28:44] indifferent it seemed to be so this and
[28:46] the other one says
[28:47] i can take the same god you're looking
[28:49] and i can make him love me
[28:51] look and see that he loves me how are
[28:54] you hearing what he's saying
[28:55] how are you interpreting the words
[28:56] coming to you it seems like he didn't
[28:58] care when he did this with the three
[29:00] hebrew children
[29:01] but he was about to come and manifest
[29:03] himself to them
[29:04] he was like come on come on be there
[29:06] with him in the fire
[29:10] remember he's the same yesterday today
[29:12] and forever
[29:15] matthew 18
[29:19] verses 18 to 20.
[29:22] i'm sorry brother peter but i forgot to
[29:24] include a scripture from peter
[29:26] i got matthew and john and luke most of
[29:29] the mcfaddens have been included in this
[29:31] scripture reading here
[29:36] verily i say unto you whatsoever ye
[29:38] shall bind on earth shall be bound
[29:40] in heaven and whatsoever he shall loose
[29:42] on earth
[29:43] shall be loosed in heaven again i say
[29:46] unto you
[29:46] if two that if two of you shall agree on
[29:49] earth
[29:49] as touching anything that they shall ask
[29:52] it shall be done for them
[29:53] of my father which is in heaven for
[29:56] where two or three are gathered together
[29:58] in my name
[29:59] there am i in the midst of them
[30:04] where two or three that means you and
[30:06] your wife and your son you and your wife
[30:08] and your daughter
[30:10] or if you happen to be by yourself you
[30:12] yourself and
[30:14] what would be the third one you in the
[30:17] lord
[30:19] you're never alone it's so easy to give
[30:23] that to somebody else
[30:24] well they deserve it they're good people
[30:27] no it's you put your name in there
[30:30] he says where two or three are gathered
[30:34] there i am in the midst of them this is
[30:35] god's word
[30:38] so what is the reason god's word is
[30:39] given to us
[30:41] so we can just read it in a book
[30:44] no so we can put it to work because he
[30:47] wants his children
[30:49] to you know it it's it's amazing i
[30:53] i watch asher
[30:56] he's three years old my grandson and
[30:58] abby will send us pictures
[31:01] amos will be under the truck working on
[31:03] his truck
[31:04] and asher is laying back with him upside
[31:07] down under the truck
[31:08] i'm helping papa he got a tool bag a
[31:12] plastic tool bag for christmas
[31:14] we got two of them one from each side
[31:16] both sides of the family
[31:18] he come over to the house and we were
[31:20] having trouble with the ceiling fan
[31:22] uh because we just put a new one on and
[31:24] wasn't working and he looks at me goes
[31:26] papa
[31:26] if i had my tools i could fix that
[31:31] in his mind he's just like his dad
[31:34] i got a tool bag i'm under the truck i
[31:36] can do it
[31:38] so abby told me while they were visiting
[31:41] the garcias
[31:43] he was walking around with the tool bag
[31:44] they gave him and he looks up at the
[31:45] pitch of the roof and he goes mama give
[31:47] me a ladder because i see something
[31:48] wrong i can fix that
[31:51] oh that i would have the same faith and
[31:54] come to god as a child
[31:56] and not get it in here first and start
[31:59] thinking
[32:00] i can't i can't it takes a minister it
[32:03] takes a prey to brother
[32:04] it takes a better christian than me now
[32:07] it's you and god
[32:09] he's more than able
[32:14] luke 11
[32:19] 9-10
[32:25] i did we finished the scripture before
[32:27] that
[32:32] all right let's go to luke
[32:38] and i say unto you ask
[32:41] i think ask involves speaking
[32:45] and it shall be given to you seek invi
[32:48] involves a little bit of opening the
[32:50] doors
[32:52] opening the book opening the shutters
[32:56] little bit of of you put yourself a
[32:58] knocking
[32:59] and it shall be opened unto you for
[33:02] everyone that asketh receiveth
[33:04] and he that seeketh findeth and to him
[33:06] and knocketh it shall be opened well
[33:10] lord i sat in my rocking chair
[33:11] for six months and you never answered me
[33:16] he says well i was waiting to hear i was
[33:19] waiting to hear
[33:20] jesus but you never spoke it either
[33:24] luke 23 verses 42 and 43
[33:30] this one when brother john andes was
[33:33] here and he i believe his brother john
[33:34] has spoke of this
[33:38] it just had never clicked to me that way
[33:40] when he said he sent it jesus lord
[33:42] remember me and he said
[33:45] he didn't think he didn't write he spoke
[33:49] and he said unto jesus lord remember me
[33:51] when thou cometh into thy kingdom
[33:53] and jesus said unto him verily i say
[33:55] unto thee today
[33:57] thou shalt be with me in paradise
[34:00] i had never put the part that today thou
[34:02] shalt be in paradise because
[34:05] when jesus got down there he would be
[34:07] there too
[34:09] it was just kind of a saying to me
[34:13] but it was god keeping his word god had
[34:16] already seen him down there
[34:19] but he had to speak he had to say
[34:22] something
[34:23] and god was waiting for that maybe
[34:25] that's what he was waiting for so he
[34:27] could say
[34:28] okay it is finished okay the last one
[34:32] has come in
[34:34] god is waiting and wanting to hear from
[34:36] you
[34:38] saint john 14
[34:43] 12 through 14 verily verily
[34:46] for sure truly truly i say unto you he
[34:50] that believeth on me
[34:51] the works that i do shall he do also and
[34:54] greater works than thee shall he do
[34:56] because
[34:56] i go unto my father and again whatsoever
[35:00] ye shall ask in my name
[35:05] that will i do that the father may be
[35:07] glorified in the son
[35:09] if you ask shall ask anything in my name
[35:13] i will do it
[35:16] do you realize what asking does what it
[35:19] shows
[35:21] shows faith and without faith it's
[35:23] impossible to please god
[35:26] and i know paul says it this way think
[35:29] on these
[35:30] things if there be any virtue if there
[35:32] be any praise
[35:33] you know what is better to have those
[35:35] thoughts in your mind
[35:37] but those thoughts also need to become
[35:38] words they need to be put into action
[35:42] it needs to get out and reach god's
[35:44] heart
[35:45] god's ears and watch him go to work
[35:48] those three boys had to say
[35:49] come to that place and say
[35:53] we will not we've heard what you said
[35:55] king and we're not disrespecting you
[35:59] we just serve a greater king we just
[36:02] have one
[36:03] that's dear to us and they put those
[36:06] words into action
[36:08] god said that's what i've been waiting
[36:09] for because you're about to get a
[36:11] visitation
[36:12] that you've never had before you're
[36:14] about to see this god that you've served
[36:16] all your life that you've done
[36:18] you're about to meet him
[36:23] did not brother branham say the angel of
[36:26] the lord came into his
[36:27] room he allowed brother billy paul he's
[36:30] jesus christ the same yesterday
[36:32] he still does those things i remember
[36:34] the testimony of our brother john rojas
[36:39] family friends and and and a good family
[36:41] friend knew him back in california
[36:43] pentecostal church he worked
[36:45] for my father in construction and they
[36:47] accepted the message they were in sierra
[36:49] vista and he he
[36:50] got sick with cancer and he was quite
[36:53] sick and he was down to his last couple
[36:55] weeks of life and him and his wife
[36:58] were were in the in in the room
[37:02] and and and they both testified the
[37:04] angel of the lord
[37:05] came into the room and says well done
[37:08] thy good and faithful sermon
[37:10] you'll be home with me sooner he's the
[37:13] same yesterday today and forever
[37:15] you know you say but oh no that came yes
[37:18] he still does those things
[37:21] well he does them over there another no
[37:24] you have got to confess with your mouth
[37:27] and believe with your heart and god will
[37:30] get to work in here
[37:34] verily very listen to he that believeth
[37:36] on me the works that i do shall he do
[37:38] also
[37:39] and greater works than these shall he do
[37:41] because i go
[37:42] unto my father and whatsoever ye shall
[37:45] ask in my name that will i do that the
[37:47] father may be glorified in the son
[37:49] if you shall ask anything in my name i
[37:52] will do it matthew 17
[37:56] 20
[38:01] and jesus said unto them because of your
[38:03] unbelief for verily i say unto you if
[38:06] you have the faith
[38:08] as a grain of mustard seed you shall say
[38:11] unto this mountain that's not you'll
[38:15] think about it you'll hope about it but
[38:17] you'll speak
[38:18] to the situation remove hence to yonder
[38:21] place
[38:22] and it shall remove and nothing shall be
[38:25] impossible unto you
[38:29] for with god all things are possible but
[38:31] he's telling nothing will be impossible
[38:33] unto you if you can take god at his word
[38:35] and apply it
[38:40] and you know what pleases god most when
[38:42] he sees the son and daughter of god
[38:44] doing those things
[38:46] when he sees him like i said watching
[38:49] watching um
[38:50] asher there doing things that a young
[38:53] boy would do
[38:54] he's copying his father and the blessing
[38:56] of that is seeing his father being a
[38:58] christian
[39:00] because if he wasn't a christian he
[39:01] might be doing things we wouldn't want
[39:02] him to be doing
[39:04] but to see him doing those things that's
[39:06] why it's important
[39:07] to live a christian life and be a very
[39:10] good example
[39:11] be christ expressed and fresh on this
[39:13] earth again
[39:15] for someone to desire i want to be like
[39:18] that
[39:19] speaking a brother called me the other
[39:20] day and we got to talk in a little bit
[39:23] and he said he mentioned his
[39:26] his nephew he says you'll never know the
[39:29] effect you had on
[39:31] him for the time he was here how you
[39:34] treated him on
[39:35] i said no i probably never will he said
[39:37] but you did
[39:38] he still talks about it and that is a
[39:42] lived life
[39:43] a sermon you know not because i preached
[39:46] or not because i did
[39:47] because something reached out and
[39:49] touched somebody
[39:51] and i live life romans 14 11 11-12
[40:02] for it is written as i live saith the
[40:04] lord every knee
[40:05] shall bow to me and every tongue shall
[40:08] confess to god
[40:10] so then every one of us shall give an
[40:12] account of himself
[40:14] to god paul puts it there
[40:17] you've got a confession a confession
[40:19] comes
[40:21] from the words we speak
[40:24] it says every knee shall bow and every
[40:26] tongue shall confess
[40:28] that jesus christ is lord you're going
[40:31] to do it willingly with all your heart
[40:32] or you're going to be forced to
[40:35] there'll come a time in everyone's life
[40:38] that they'll have to say
[40:39] yeah that was god i want to confess that
[40:42] now
[40:42] he's my lord there is no other
[40:46] he says and you'll have to give an
[40:48] account
[40:50] you know i want my account
[40:53] to show that it was covered by the blood
[40:57] i want my account to say that his heart
[40:59] was pure like he talked about
[41:01] um solomon and because you had the right
[41:04] attitude and the right heart
[41:05] the right desires it can be done
[41:08] it can be said of you
[41:12] it's not just for the minister it's just
[41:14] not for that saintly sister
[41:16] it's for every one of us
[41:20] romans 10 verses 8 to 10
[41:26] but what saith it what saith the word of
[41:28] god the word is nigh thee
[41:30] even in thy mouth and in thine heart
[41:34] that is the word of faith which we
[41:36] preach that if thou
[41:38] shalt confess with thy mouth the lord
[41:40] jesus and shall believe in thine heart
[41:42] that god has raised him from the dead
[41:45] thou shalt be
[41:46] saved if you can't believe that he was
[41:48] raised from the dead then you're in
[41:50] trouble
[41:51] because you then you can't have faith
[41:53] that you'll be raised from the dead
[41:56] and be like job though the skin worms
[41:58] eat this body though they bury me
[41:59] yet i know these eyes shall see my
[42:02] redeemer
[42:03] these eyes he said he knew that there
[42:07] was a promise there
[42:12] and for with the heart man believeth
[42:14] unto righteousness
[42:16] and with the mouth confession is made
[42:19] unto salvation
[42:22] yea lord i believe sometimes it's helped
[42:25] out my unbelief
[42:28] but that's a conflict you're still
[42:30] asking god
[42:31] to do what his word says
[42:35] now we have
[42:39] luke 12 and 8.
[42:42] i know most of these scriptures are
[42:44] you've heard a thousand times
[42:47] or better but it's still the living word
[42:50] of god
[42:51] and i say unto you whosoever shall
[42:52] confess me before man
[42:55] him shall the son of man also confess
[42:58] before the angels of god
[43:01] i love that dream that that brother
[43:04] brahm talked about
[43:06] of the man that got up before heaven
[43:09] and asked if his name was there and the
[43:12] angels look and says i can't find your
[43:14] name
[43:15] well what do i do now says you'll have
[43:17] to go before the throne there
[43:19] and plead your case and he begins to
[43:23] realize
[43:24] that he has no chance whatsoever
[43:28] that light begins to penetrate through
[43:30] every thought through every attitude
[43:32] through every notion you had and begins
[43:34] to show it
[43:35] unless it's been covered by the blood
[43:38] then it can't be revealed no more it
[43:39] doesn't exist
[43:41] but he said i heard the sweetest sound
[43:42] the sweetest voice
[43:45] came up behind me and said father on
[43:47] earth
[43:48] he stood for me therefore i'll stand for
[43:51] him today
[43:54] you know brother brandon when he walked
[43:56] into that little restaurant
[43:58] and he walked in and he had seen all
[44:00] that ungodliness going on that old
[44:02] the policeman and it just it just made
[44:05] him upset
[44:06] and he goes outside and he begins to say
[44:08] god how can you stand all this filth how
[44:10] can you
[44:11] you should just destroy them all and god
[44:14] has to give him a vision about his sins
[44:16] hitting god
[44:17] and that banner of blood there
[44:21] and then watch the change in brother
[44:23] braham's attitude
[44:24] so quick then i'll go back and all
[44:28] give to them that same opportunity that
[44:30] i have
[44:33] he says
[44:38] john first john 4 15
[44:45] whosoever shall confess that jesus is
[44:48] the son of god
[44:49] god dwelleth in him and he and god
[44:55] it's not just verbal words you say but
[44:58] it has to be a life
[44:59] it has to be something inside of you
[45:01] coming out that way
[45:03] and then david we know david mann
[45:07] after god's own heart
[45:10] but the bible it's written
[45:13] david's life has shown very well his
[45:15] failures his mistakes
[45:18] him being human him being weak
[45:22] but it also shows the revelation of god
[45:24] in david's heart
[45:26] to be able to express to words that you
[45:28] and i are going to need
[45:33] psalms 32 we'll
[45:36] read verses 1 through 5.
[45:40] blessed is he whose transgression is
[45:42] forgiven
[45:43] whose sin is covered blessed is the man
[45:47] unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity
[45:50] and in whose spirit there is no guile
[45:55] let's continue
[45:59] when i kept silence my bones waxed old
[46:03] through my roaring or through my
[46:04] groaning through my anguish
[46:06] all the day long when i've when i've
[46:09] tried to hide them
[46:10] when i've not repented of them when i've
[46:12] not admitted them to god
[46:14] when i've not put them under the blood
[46:16] then my bones waxed old
[46:18] through my roaring all the day long when
[46:20] i was too embarrassed too ashamed of my
[46:22] actions that i wouldn't even confess
[46:24] them
[46:25] when the quickest way is to say i was
[46:27] wrong forgive me
[46:29] cover me by your blood and then the
[46:32] peace of god
[46:33] comes with that for day and night thy
[46:36] hand was heavy
[46:38] upon me
[46:42] you just can't rest you just can't hide
[46:45] you just can't get away
[46:46] until that is made right
[46:49] he says my moisture is turned into the
[46:52] drought
[46:52] of summer is i couldn't even cry anymore
[46:55] i felt dry
[46:56] i felt dead he said but then i
[47:00] acknowledge my sin
[47:01] unto thee and my iniquity have i not hid
[47:04] i said i will confess
[47:06] my transgressions unto the lord and thou
[47:09] forgave us the iniquity of my sin
[47:13] until david began to say i and he
[47:16] confessed it with his own mouth
[47:19] not a blaming not an excuse but saying
[47:22] i was wrong i made a mistake
[47:26] i messed up and maybe again
[47:30] and god said and then david says in
[47:33] verse
[47:34] 7 thou art my hiding place
[47:39] thou shalt preserve me from trouble
[47:43] thou shalt compass me about with songs
[47:46] of
[47:46] deliverance your heart begins to sing
[47:50] again
[47:51] your heart begins to worship the lord
[47:53] songs of deliverance
[47:55] oh yes jesus loves me
[47:58] oh how much he cares and you begin to
[48:02] feel that relief that lifting up
[48:06] and we'll finish it with the last verse
[48:08] first john
[48:09] 1 6
[48:12] through 9. sometimes this seems
[48:17] a little contrary then
[48:21] in in one way just a christian does not
[48:24] sin
[48:25] john is telling and then he says this
[48:28] if we say that we have fellowship with
[48:30] him and walk in darkness we lie
[48:32] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[48:35] the light
[48:36] as he is in the light we have
[48:39] fellowship one with another and the
[48:40] blood of jesus christ his son
[48:42] cleanses us from all sin
[48:46] david said blessed is a man who god does
[48:48] not impute
[48:49] iniquity he didn't say blessed is the
[48:53] man who walks perfect
[48:55] who never fails he said blessed is the
[48:58] man who god
[48:58] does not hold it against him and john is
[49:02] saying if we walk in the light
[49:03] what is the light the word of god what
[49:05] does the word god tell you make it right
[49:08] confess it say i'm sorry put it under
[49:11] the blood
[49:12] if you walk under the light not of
[49:14] confessing it to a man not of doing
[49:16] penance
[49:17] not of providing your own sacrifice but
[49:19] doing what god said
[49:21] he says we walk in the light as he is in
[49:24] the light we have fellowship one
[49:26] with another and the blood of jesus
[49:28] christ his son
[49:30] cleanses us from all sin
[49:36] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[49:38] ourselves
[49:39] and the truth is not in us
[49:42] if i look at myself as a human
[49:46] in flesh i realize there's nothing good
[49:49] about me
[49:50] but if i confess what god says and stand
[49:54] on that
[49:55] then god looks at me through the shed
[49:56] blood
[49:58] he's been accepted in my stead
[50:02] he's been accepted in your place if we
[50:05] confess our sins
[50:06] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[50:09] our sins
[50:09] and to cleanse us from all
[50:12] unrighteousness
[50:15] sometimes when you're frustrated
[50:19] and you're upset and you're
[50:23] troubled because it seems like god
[50:24] doesn't hear just take a look
[50:27] take a close examination what is between
[50:30] me and god
[50:31] what's causing that it's not god's fault
[50:35] god keeps his word god never fails
[50:39] he's a great help he's a great
[50:40] deliverance he he's not only that but
[50:42] he's not caught
[50:43] unawares it's not like he has to come up
[50:45] with a new solution and says hang on a
[50:47] bit
[50:47] i need to go back into the lab and and
[50:49] try this and see if this works
[50:52] no he's already provided he's just
[50:54] waiting for you to say
[50:55] okay lord be it unto me according to thy
[50:59] word
[51:01] and your word says if i confess if i
[51:04] confess you to be lord
[51:06] if i convey every part of this that if i
[51:09] confess
[51:09] god keeps his word and never fails
[51:13] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[51:16] and just to forgive us
[51:19] our sins and cleanse us from all
[51:22] unrighteousness o to be clean
[51:25] and pure before god to hear
[51:29] well done thou good and faithful servant
[51:34] i think we're all waiting for that we're
[51:36] all warning to that we're all desiring
[51:38] that
[51:38] to hear him say this is my beloved son
[51:42] this is my beloved daughter i'm not
[51:44] ashamed to call them my own
[51:47] this is my bride let's bow our hands the
[51:49] musicians will come
[51:52] lord your word is true it's unfailing
[51:57] it's eternal you are faithful lord
[52:02] and you are just in what you do
[52:07] hear the words of brother branham when
[52:09] he said
[52:10] if i came to that that day and he said
[52:15] depart from me william branham
[52:18] and you're going to hell brother brahm
[52:20] said i love him too much
[52:22] to argue with him
[52:26] lord may our hearts be at a place father
[52:29] that we would be quickly willing to say
[52:32] and confess
[52:34] first of all that we are no good of
[52:36] ourselves but we're
[52:38] truly trusting and confiding in what
[52:40] your word says
[52:43] and that the joy that it brings to you
[52:45] the the
[52:46] how your heart is filled when you see
[52:48] your sons and daughters
