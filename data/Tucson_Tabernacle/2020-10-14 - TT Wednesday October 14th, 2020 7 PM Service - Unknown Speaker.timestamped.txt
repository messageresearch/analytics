[45:30] done and the results came back there was
[45:32] no injury no damage done so
[45:34] praising the lord for that but the

[45:40] he's retired now he was a truck driver
[45:42] for a long time and
[45:43] he remembered one of his co-workers it
[45:45] was his birthing just decided to give

[55:09] efforts to come out on a wednesday night
[55:12] that means a lot
[55:18] i'm certainly grateful that it was not
[55:20] announced that i would
[55:21] be here perhaps there wouldn't be so
[55:23] many
[55:24] so we're thankful for
[55:27] whoever would come to the house of the
[55:29] lord this evening to hear the word of
[55:31] god
[55:32] mark chapter 2 i just want to read
[55:36] two verses verse 11 and 12
[55:40] jesus speaking says i say unto thee
[55:43] arise
[55:45] and take up thy bed and go thy way into
[55:48] thine house
[55:49] and immediately he arose took up the bed
[55:53] and went forth before them all in so
[55:56] much
[55:57] that they were all amazed and glorified
[56:00] god
[56:00] saying we never saw it on this fashion
[56:05] and may god had his blessing to his word
[56:07] if you wouldn't mind bowing your heads
[56:09] for
[56:09] a word of prayer our precious and lovely
[56:12] heavenly father lord we
[56:14] find it an honor lord to have health
[56:18] and sound minds to come into this house
[56:20] of prayer
[56:21] lord to be gathered under the name of
[56:23] jesus christ where you said where two or
[56:25] three would gather
[56:26] in that name you would be in our midst
[56:29] lord we're
[56:30] counting on that we rely upon that this
[56:32] evening
[56:33] we ask heavenly father that you would
[56:35] make yourself
[56:36] present here lord that
[56:41] there would be no spirit no evil spirit
[56:45] welcome in this place
[56:47] that are welcome to be dismissed from
[56:49] this place
[56:50] that lord if there'd be any sick if
[56:52] there'd be any infirmities
[56:54] and anyone here lord jesus we ask that
[56:56] you would come and do the same things
[56:58] you did while you walked the shores of
[57:00] galilee
[57:01] lord casting out the devil and his
[57:04] the evil spirit's lord and and bringing
[57:07] healing to
[57:08] the bodies of those that were sick and
[57:10] afflicted lord we ask that you would
[57:13] have the preeminence in this service
[57:15] that god you would
[57:18] teach us lord that we could sit at your
[57:20] feet and learn of you
[57:22] and lord that we would just leave this
[57:24] place drawn closer to you and more in
[57:26] love than we've ever been with you
[57:29] and lord we ask all these favors and all
[57:32] these blessings
[57:33] in jesus christ's name amen amen thank
[57:36] you you can have your seats
[57:46] uh this morning this morning this
[57:48] evening excuse me
[57:50] uh i'd like to speak i had a for a title
[57:53] a normal service
[57:56] and that may sound like a strange
[58:02] title sermon title but my thoughts are
[58:06] are geared many times toward the young
[58:08] people
[58:09] because i have young people for children
[58:13] now
[58:15] and i certainly do not
[58:18] desire them to grow up in church
[58:23] just for the sake of a tradition but i
[58:26] would desire for them
[58:27] to know the same jesus christ that i met
[58:32] about 21 years ago
[58:36] not just to come to a building
[58:41] um so that they can take a nap or
[58:45] um pass time
[58:49] but that the lord something for them
[58:53] that they would recognize was beyond man
[58:57] beyond what a preacher could do beyond
[58:59] what any man or woman could do in their
[59:01] own ability but
[59:02] that only god could do
[59:05] and so many a time i think of the
[59:07] question if you
[59:08] asked a young person the question how
[59:11] was
[59:12] church
[59:15] usually out of courtesy a young person
[59:18] will tell you it was fine
[59:20] and then if you follow up the question
[59:22] with well what did he preach about
[59:26] then it starts to get a little vague
[59:31] and you know the uh
[59:34] the the answer where they no they won't
[59:37] get in trouble
[59:38] is to say about jesus or about the bible
[59:42] and they can't lose usually there
[59:49] but many times as you get older and
[59:53] those of that have been going to a
[59:54] church
[59:56] so-called church for many many years uh
[1:00:00] you have probably if you've been around
[1:00:05] um and depending on which
[1:00:08] i suppose church service you've been in
[1:00:12] they don't always go so wonderful and
[1:00:14] they're not always
[1:00:16] um what you expected
[1:00:19] and and so then if you were to be honest
[1:00:23] with the question
[1:00:24] how was church your answer
[1:00:27] might not come out it was wonderful or
[1:00:30] um oh i learned so much it may not be
[1:00:33] that
[1:00:35] and that's what we want we want to be
[1:00:36] honest before god
[1:00:39] so that when we ask how was church
[1:00:42] then we know exactly what the question
[1:00:44] is and
[1:00:46] and we want the answer to be appropriate
[1:00:51] and so then the question is well what
[1:00:52] does it mean to go to church
[1:00:56] or what should a normal
[1:00:59] church service look like
[1:01:02] and so i just want to spend a little bit
[1:01:05] of time and i'm going to
[1:01:06] be very mindful of my time it's
[1:01:08] wednesday night and i know for those of
[1:01:10] you that have to
[1:01:11] punch the clock early in the morning we
[1:01:12] don't want to hold you very long
[1:01:16] but the question is well what does it
[1:01:18] even mean church what does
[1:01:20] that even really mean what is church
[1:01:25] and the prophet of god
[1:01:29] tells us that before
[1:01:32] the children of israel were called out
[1:01:35] of egypt
[1:01:36] they were known as the children of god
[1:01:38] or the people of god
[1:01:40] but that after they were called out
[1:01:43] they were known as the church of god and
[1:01:46] the reason for that is because
[1:01:48] the word church means called out
[1:01:53] so then we say well what was it then
[1:01:55] before egypt what
[1:01:57] what what was church before they were
[1:02:01] down in egypt
[1:02:04] well if we go back to the beginning um
[1:02:08] where well i suppose if we went all the
[1:02:11] way back to the beginning of adam and
[1:02:12] eve
[1:02:13] and then them and their children um
[1:02:16] it would be a lip to ear
[1:02:19] account of parents and grandparents
[1:02:23] telling the children about the about
[1:02:27] about god and about who he is
[1:02:30] and about the things that he had done
[1:02:34] and the promises he had made from the
[1:02:36] beginning
[1:02:39] and then we get to the flood and the
[1:02:42] earth is
[1:02:43] destroyed by water and noah and those on
[1:02:46] the ark then go out
[1:02:48] and repopulate the earth again
[1:02:52] and we see as the babel
[1:02:55] the tower of babel was erect and then
[1:02:59] god saw that they were all of one mind
[1:03:00] and then he scattered their language
[1:03:03] and he confused them and then they went
[1:03:05] out and and
[1:03:07] and spread amongst the earth with
[1:03:10] multiple languages we see again the
[1:03:13] earth populating and we see
[1:03:18] ancestry worship pop up we see idolatry
[1:03:21] pop up
[1:03:21] and spread throughout the regions
[1:03:25] and we see abraham called
[1:03:28] out of babylon and
[1:03:32] god calling him out and saying abram
[1:03:35] separate yourself from your from your
[1:03:38] people
[1:03:39] and he called abraham to himself and
[1:03:41] then we realized that from abraham
[1:03:44] came isaac from isaac came jacob who
[1:03:47] later became israel and israel had
[1:03:51] children
[1:03:52] 12 sons and we see then the tribes of
[1:03:55] israel being
[1:03:56] set up but then they go down
[1:03:59] after joseph raises up and sits on the
[1:04:02] right hand of
[1:04:03] of pharaoh and pharaoh recognizing
[1:04:09] god in the life of joseph and preserving
[1:04:13] not only pharaoh's life but all of man's
[1:04:16] life that would come to egypt
[1:04:18] that had stored up the food during the
[1:04:20] famine
[1:04:21] pharaoh says joseph sit on my right hand
[1:04:24] your words as good as my word
[1:04:26] and pharaoh recognized uh joseph and
[1:04:30] we understand the type there of of of
[1:04:33] uh god and christ
[1:04:37] but then the bible says there raised up
[1:04:39] a pharaoh that knew not joseph
[1:04:42] or his god and and that then
[1:04:45] he put the children of israel into
[1:04:47] bondage
[1:04:49] and as the children came out of egypt
[1:04:51] this calling
[1:04:52] out once again
[1:04:56] they're now known as the church of god
[1:05:01] now i just want to turn over into some
[1:05:04] scriptures in deuteronomy
[1:05:06] and i want to read in deuteronomy
[1:05:08] chapter six
[1:05:10] um something that god had commanded
[1:05:15] for the children of israel what what
[1:05:17] they were to do
[1:05:19] with the word of god with the with all
[1:05:21] of the promises and all of the accounts
[1:05:23] of what god had done
[1:05:25] for the children of israel and his
[1:05:28] desire to call them out
[1:05:32] here's his instructions in deuteronomy
[1:05:34] chapter 6 and i want to just read
[1:05:36] verses 1 through 9 now these are the
[1:05:38] commandments
[1:05:39] the statutes and the judgments which the
[1:05:42] lord your god
[1:05:44] commanded to teach you that ye might do
[1:05:47] them
[1:05:48] in the land whither ye go to possess it
[1:05:52] that thou mightest fear the lord thy god
[1:05:56] to keep all his statutes and his
[1:05:59] commandments
[1:06:00] which i command thee thou and thy son
[1:06:03] and thy son son all the days of thy life
[1:06:07] and that thy days may be prolonged
[1:06:11] hear therefore o israel and observe to
[1:06:15] do it
[1:06:16] that it may be well with thee and that
[1:06:19] ye may
[1:06:19] increase mightily as the lord god of thy
[1:06:22] fathers hath promised thee
[1:06:24] in the land that floweth with milk and
[1:06:27] honey
[1:06:28] hear o israel the lord our god
[1:06:31] is one lord and thou shalt love the lord
[1:06:35] thy god
[1:06:36] with all thine heart and with all thy
[1:06:38] soul
[1:06:39] and with all thy might and these words
[1:06:42] which i command thee this day
[1:06:45] shall be in thine heart and thou shalt
[1:06:48] teach them diligently unto thy children
[1:06:51] and shall talk of them when thou sittest
[1:06:54] in thine house
[1:06:56] and when thou walkest by the way and
[1:06:59] when thou
[1:07:00] liest down and when thou risest
[1:07:03] up and thou shalt bind them
[1:07:06] for a sign upon thine hand and they
[1:07:09] shall be as
[1:07:10] frontlets between thine eyes and thou
[1:07:14] shalt write them upon the posts of thy
[1:07:17] house
[1:07:18] and on thy gates so that
[1:07:21] everything about you everywhere you go
[1:07:24] everything you say the word of the lord
[1:07:28] is with you
[1:07:28] it's in your mouth it's in your mind
[1:07:31] it's in your heart
[1:07:32] it's all it's your whole life and it
[1:07:35] should be
[1:07:36] your whole life and it should be your
[1:07:38] children's life
[1:07:40] and it should be everyone that comes
[1:07:42] into your gates
[1:07:43] need to know what you believe
[1:07:49] now we realize that
[1:07:53] then god tells moses
[1:07:56] to to
[1:08:00] create to make a a tabernacle
[1:08:04] according to the image that he showed
[1:08:07] him and he creates a building
[1:08:09] and this building was going to be a
[1:08:11] place that the priests the levites could
[1:08:14] come unto
[1:08:14] and that the word of god could be into
[1:08:17] that holiest of holies and
[1:08:19] that the shoot that the uh
[1:08:22] the omer of mana would be in there that
[1:08:25] the the
[1:08:26] the the tablets of of the law would be
[1:08:29] in there
[1:08:29] and that the rod of aaron would be in
[1:08:32] there
[1:08:33] and and and he wanted them to bring
[1:08:35] sacrifice unto this place
[1:08:37] and constantly there would be this place
[1:08:40] and this was a building then
[1:08:42] that they could come and they could
[1:08:43] gather but the priests could go into and
[1:08:46] the
[1:08:46] congregation could come into that
[1:08:48] sanctuary and bring their offerings and
[1:08:51] bring their
[1:08:52] their their tithes and and
[1:08:55] their sacrifices
[1:08:58] and then david desires to build god a
[1:09:01] house
[1:09:02] david himself has been blessed by god
[1:09:04] and he has a house and he says
[1:09:06] i'd like to build a house for god but
[1:09:09] god tells him david you can't
[1:09:11] but your son will then solomon's temple
[1:09:14] is built and we know the stories that
[1:09:17] how that even today over in jerusalem
[1:09:19] the jews are awaiting a time
[1:09:21] that that that that temple could be
[1:09:24] erected once again
[1:09:25] that they could restore the the temple
[1:09:28] worship
[1:09:29] in that place well
[1:09:33] it's not a strange thing because we read
[1:09:36] over here in
[1:09:37] deuteronomy chapter 16 and verse 6
[1:09:42] it says but at the place which
[1:09:45] the lord thy god shall choose to place
[1:09:48] his name in
[1:09:50] there thou shalt sacrifice the passover
[1:09:53] and even
[1:09:54] at the going down of the sun at the
[1:09:56] season
[1:09:57] that thou camest forth out of egypt
[1:10:02] so now we see a place that god is saying
[1:10:06] in the place not just anywhere do you
[1:10:09] bring your sacrifice
[1:10:10] not just at any place but in the place
[1:10:14] in the gates where i place my name in
[1:10:17] that's where you shall do that now this
[1:10:20] scripture might
[1:10:21] really be familiar to us in this day
[1:10:24] having heard the message of this hour
[1:10:27] because this was the scripture used for
[1:10:29] a sermon
[1:10:30] called god's only provided place of
[1:10:33] worship
[1:10:35] and the significance that we recognize
[1:10:38] is that
[1:10:39] this is not a physical location
[1:10:42] that god was speaking about but this was
[1:10:45] a person
[1:10:46] and that person was jesus christ
[1:10:50] that's the place where god chose to put
[1:10:52] his name in
[1:10:54] and that name was the lord jesus christ
[1:10:58] and we recognize that and we see that
[1:11:01] that that in all of the types whether it
[1:11:04] be the passover lamb
[1:11:06] but everything that had to do with the
[1:11:08] passover and all of those
[1:11:10] ordinances that god had given the
[1:11:12] children of israel
[1:11:13] christ himself even speaking
[1:11:16] on the on the steps of solomon's temple
[1:11:19] said
[1:11:20] tear this place down and in three days
[1:11:24] i'll rise it raise it up again
[1:11:27] and they thought my that took the
[1:11:30] children of israel
[1:11:32] 40 years to build this temple and you're
[1:11:35] saying that you're going to rebuild it
[1:11:37] if we tore it down
[1:11:38] in three days and the scripture declares
[1:11:41] that
[1:11:42] even the disciples did not understand
[1:11:45] what he spoke about
[1:11:47] until the death burial and resurrection
[1:11:50] that he wasn't speaking of that physical
[1:11:53] temple but his body was he
[1:11:56] speaking about that within three days he
[1:12:00] would raise from the dead
[1:12:02] and we can look back now and say oh my
[1:12:06] of course
[1:12:07] we recognize that the types and the
[1:12:10] shadows of the old testament were all
[1:12:13] speaking of the person of
[1:12:16] jesus christ
[1:12:25] so again just to kind of bring us right
[1:12:28] back around the question
[1:12:30] was asked well what is church
[1:12:33] and what then is a church service and
[1:12:36] what is a normal
[1:12:37] service to look like
[1:12:42] well i thought of the services
[1:12:46] of jesus himself
[1:12:49] and the very scripture we read here in
[1:12:51] mark chapter 2.
[1:12:54] now jesus taught many a time
[1:12:58] on a boat down by the seashore
[1:13:02] open air up on the hillside
[1:13:06] it was an outdoor gathering of people
[1:13:09] interested in hearing the
[1:13:12] the word of god
[1:13:16] the the promises of god the promises
[1:13:19] that were left for the children
[1:13:21] of god that jesus began expounding on
[1:13:26] and teaching about these things
[1:13:30] shining more light on the word that had
[1:13:34] been given
[1:13:35] but in this instance in mark chapter 2
[1:13:39] jesus comes into capernaum and he comes
[1:13:42] into a house
[1:13:44] and so this gathering takes place in a
[1:13:47] house
[1:13:48] and in history especially for you young
[1:13:51] people
[1:13:53] that is where church services
[1:13:56] if you want to call it that really began
[1:13:58] to take place was
[1:14:00] in the houses and i'm going to jump
[1:14:02] ahead a little bit here
[1:14:03] but if you find in the when you read
[1:14:05] your book of acts
[1:14:07] you'll find that peter when he
[1:14:10] had come to the gentiles which was in
[1:14:12] the house of cornelius
[1:14:14] that's exactly where it began was in a
[1:14:17] house
[1:14:18] a man named cornelius it was in his
[1:14:22] house that he had
[1:14:23] invited peter to and there was many
[1:14:26] gathered in that house and peter
[1:14:30] asks the question what is it that you
[1:14:33] would like
[1:14:34] why did you call me here and cornelius
[1:14:37] explains to peter
[1:14:38] an angel appeared unto me and told me to
[1:14:42] go and to get
[1:14:43] you and that you would instruct us
[1:14:46] and peter is amazed and he says now the
[1:14:49] law says for a jew
[1:14:50] to not gather under the house of a
[1:14:54] gentile
[1:14:55] but it just so happens that a few days
[1:14:59] ago when the angel came to cornelius
[1:15:02] i was shown a vision of a sheep being
[1:15:05] let down
[1:15:06] and there was all types of animals and
[1:15:08] you know the story rise kill and eat not
[1:15:10] so lord i've never
[1:15:12] peter don't call unclean what i have
[1:15:15] cleansed
[1:15:16] and he sees this a couple times and he
[1:15:18] says
[1:15:19] now i know that god is no respecter of
[1:15:22] persons but
[1:15:24] just as he's come to us the children of
[1:15:26] israel
[1:15:27] he's also making himself known even to
[1:15:31] those that would fear god and respect
[1:15:34] his word
[1:15:35] and the scripture says while he
[1:15:38] spake these words the holy ghost
[1:15:41] fell on them and they received the holy
[1:15:44] ghost
[1:15:45] just as they had in that upper room on
[1:15:48] the day of pentecost
[1:15:52] now jumping back jesus is in a house
[1:15:55] and he's preaching and there's so many
[1:15:58] gathered it says that they couldn't even
[1:15:59] come in the door
[1:16:00] it was so full in this house
[1:16:04] and so no doubt they were gathered on
[1:16:06] the outside of the house
[1:16:07] doing their best to hear the words of
[1:16:10] this young rabbi
[1:16:12] jesus of nazareth and as they're
[1:16:15] listening to jesus
[1:16:17] we would imagine it like a service a
[1:16:20] church service
[1:16:21] and he's a preacher the rabbi
[1:16:24] and he is preaching his sermon and
[1:16:27] they're listening to him and we don't
[1:16:29] have
[1:16:30] it doesn't expound on what words jesus
[1:16:33] was
[1:16:34] saying it doesn't tell us what his
[1:16:36] sermon was
[1:16:37] that day but what it does tell us
[1:16:41] is that while he was preaching four men
[1:16:45] got up on the roof and they had a friend
[1:16:48] of theirs that was
[1:16:49] had had a palsy he was sick of the palsy
[1:16:53] and he was on a cot and they had heard
[1:16:56] that where jesus was there was many
[1:16:59] mighty works done
[1:17:01] there was miracles that happened that
[1:17:04] somehow
[1:17:05] god was so with this man
[1:17:08] that miracles took place blinded eyes
[1:17:11] were
[1:17:12] opened dumb began to speak the death
[1:17:14] began to hear
[1:17:16] and devils were cast out of people that
[1:17:19] he
[1:17:19] that they knew had devils upon them they
[1:17:22] were
[1:17:22] perhaps in society thought of crazy
[1:17:26] or or homeless maybe or strange
[1:17:30] whatever it would be they were devils on
[1:17:32] them
[1:17:33] and when jesus would cast these devils
[1:17:36] out of these people they became whole
[1:17:39] and
[1:17:39] normal and were able to enter into
[1:17:43] society
[1:17:44] with their right minds and be a
[1:17:47] a contribution to all of society and a
[1:17:50] benefit
[1:17:52] and these friends thought if we could
[1:17:55] get
[1:17:56] our friend to this jesus
[1:18:00] i believe our friend could be made whole
[1:18:03] like those others and while
[1:18:06] jesus is preaching this service and you
[1:18:09] thought
[1:18:09] what a nice service we've come into the
[1:18:12] house
[1:18:14] everything seems to be normal
[1:18:17] and he's giving words and they're such
[1:18:19] lovely words we like
[1:18:21] that but suddenly there's a disruption
[1:18:25] and the roof begins caving down in
[1:18:28] and the top begins to get torn off
[1:18:31] and perhaps people thought in their mind
[1:18:34] this is not normal what is happening
[1:18:39] we came to hear the rabbi and now the
[1:18:42] roof
[1:18:43] is getting torn off where's the owner of
[1:18:46] the house
[1:18:47] i'd like to file a complaint could
[1:18:50] somebody please go outside
[1:18:53] and stop this from happening but jesus
[1:18:57] as that man gets lowered down in front
[1:18:59] of him
[1:19:00] he uh being god in flesh and
[1:19:04] having the spirit of god and the ability
[1:19:06] to discern spirits
[1:19:08] the scripture says he could he saw the
[1:19:11] faith
[1:19:12] of those four friends and he said
[1:19:16] because of their faith he turned and he
[1:19:18] looked at the man on the cot
[1:19:19] and he says thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:19:24] now it declares the scribes didn't like
[1:19:27] that
[1:19:27] that was that upset their sermon their
[1:19:31] church service
[1:19:32] just a little bit more because now jesus
[1:19:35] is saying something that they know
[1:19:38] themselves
[1:19:39] that god teaches that only god
[1:19:42] can forgive sins and jesus
[1:19:46] knowing because he can discern spirits
[1:19:49] knowing that looks at the scribes and
[1:19:51] says what is
[1:19:52] easier for a man to say thy sins be
[1:19:56] forgiven thee
[1:19:56] or take up thy bed and go thy way he
[1:20:00] says but
[1:20:00] for your sakes i say to this man
[1:20:04] take up thy bed and go thy way
[1:20:07] and immediately the man rose
[1:20:10] up off of the bed took up his bed
[1:20:14] and went his way and they all marveled
[1:20:18] and glorified god saying we've
[1:20:21] never seen something like this before
[1:20:31] so now you've got to ask yourself
[1:20:35] is that a normal service
[1:20:40] is that what church is supposed to be
[1:20:45] well
[1:20:48] like in the case of corn the house of
[1:20:51] cornelius
[1:20:54] when they expressed to peter
[1:20:58] what had happened in cornelius's life
[1:21:02] peter then began speaking to them
[1:21:05] about the lord jesus christ and who he
[1:21:09] was and while he spake these words
[1:21:13] the holy ghost fell on them
[1:21:16] and they were filled with the baptism of
[1:21:19] the holy ghost
[1:21:20] while he spake those words
[1:21:25] well then you've got to ask yourself is
[1:21:28] that
[1:21:28] a normal church service
[1:21:33] we find in the book of acts i believe
[1:21:35] it's chapter 14
[1:21:37] paul is in a city called lystra
[1:21:40] lystra i'm not sure how to pronounce
[1:21:43] that lyconia
[1:21:45] and there's a man who's impotent in his
[1:21:48] feet
[1:21:49] and paul looking on the man perceiving
[1:21:52] that he had
[1:21:53] faith to be healed tells the man
[1:21:57] rise up and walk and the man
[1:22:00] immediately raises up who'd been
[1:22:03] impotent in his feet means he had no
[1:22:06] strength at all in his feet he could not
[1:22:08] walk immediately
[1:22:10] because of the faith that he had in his
[1:22:13] heart received those words and by
[1:22:16] faith reached out and claimed that that
[1:22:19] was of god
[1:22:20] and he rose up and received his healing
[1:22:24] is that a normal service
[1:22:33] these were the services that jesus had
[1:22:36] these were the services
[1:22:38] that the disciples had and if you go and
[1:22:41] you read
[1:22:42] uh your church age book
[1:22:45] and you go into that beginning where
[1:22:47] brother branham begins to speak about
[1:22:48] the messenger for each age and how that
[1:22:51] where the reason he could come up with
[1:22:54] those messengers for that age was he
[1:22:56] said
[1:22:56] i took paul as the pattern
[1:23:00] paul was that pattern and if those men's
[1:23:02] lives
[1:23:04] matched paul's lives that that's how he
[1:23:07] knew and
[1:23:08] and and that's how he could
[1:23:09] differentiate even between
[1:23:11] polycarp and irenaeus he thought i
[1:23:15] thought
[1:23:15] he said i thought it was that polycarp
[1:23:18] would have been
[1:23:19] the the messenger from the age but he
[1:23:22] said he leaned more towards
[1:23:24] organization and
[1:23:27] he said but all of these men when you go
[1:23:30] and you read in your church age book
[1:23:31] about those men
[1:23:33] brother branham gives just a short
[1:23:36] uh piece on how that in each one of
[1:23:40] these men's lives
[1:23:43] the the works and and the spirit of god
[1:23:47] moved in their ministry
[1:23:50] and this was what from from the
[1:23:52] beginning down to the end
[1:23:54] and and he even gives the the
[1:23:57] illustration of
[1:23:58] of john wesley and how that john wesley
[1:24:01] himself
[1:24:02] you know he rode i think it was a
[1:24:04] quarter of a million
[1:24:05] miles on horseback when he was doing all
[1:24:08] of his
[1:24:09] his missionary work and how that at one
[1:24:11] point even his horse
[1:24:13] fell and broke its leg and wesley got
[1:24:16] down and prayed for his
[1:24:18] horse and his horse was healed
[1:24:24] well is that a normal church service
[1:24:29] now in our modern day
[1:24:35] that
[1:24:40] when i say church i i want us to clarify
[1:24:43] that now
[1:24:44] when i say of a church service
[1:24:47] i'm speaking of the church in general
[1:24:52] in a modern day church
[1:24:56] service
[1:25:00] you wouldn't see much of that anymore
[1:25:04] you would see a lot of smoke a lot of a
[1:25:07] lot of uh
[1:25:08] loud music and and
[1:25:13] fancy light work
[1:25:18] but this seems to be something strange
[1:25:20] to the modern church
[1:25:24] but in our day god sent a prophet
[1:25:33] we have about 1200 sermons
[1:25:37] and those of you that that listen to
[1:25:39] those sermons
[1:25:41] you can just almost randomly grab one
[1:25:45] and put it in or i should say
[1:25:48] pull it up on your phone or however it
[1:25:51] is that you listen to him now
[1:25:54] but this is not uncommon the very things
[1:25:58] that you read
[1:25:59] in this bible that we just talked about
[1:26:03] is not uncommon for you to hear on those
[1:26:06] tapes
[1:26:08] you'll hear the prophet of god take a
[1:26:10] scripture
[1:26:11] perhaps a sermon title blind bartimaeus
[1:26:14] or
[1:26:17] testimony by the sea
[1:26:20] and you think okay i have an idea of
[1:26:23] what he's going to talk about and
[1:26:25] he'll take a text and he'll begin to
[1:26:27] talk
[1:26:29] and then he'll say now
[1:26:33] he might say something like this now
[1:26:36] if what i've told you is the truth
[1:26:40] let him come and and and testify
[1:26:44] or show that what i've said is the truth
[1:26:49] and then he'll ask now i believe that
[1:26:52] they passed out some prayer
[1:26:53] cards and he they would
[1:26:56] call the cards and make a line and the
[1:26:59] people would get in that line and he
[1:27:01] would begin talking and he'd say now
[1:27:03] you all know what i'm doing don't you
[1:27:05] i'm waiting for him
[1:27:07] i'm waiting for him now to come
[1:27:11] and then as soon as he says now he's
[1:27:13] here
[1:27:15] and then many times he'll he'll say
[1:27:17] something like now i take
[1:27:18] every spirit in this place under my
[1:27:21] control
[1:27:24] and then someone would come before him
[1:27:25] and and he would say how do you do and
[1:27:29] so on and so forth and
[1:27:33] and then the discernment would begin
[1:27:36] and it would be so remarkable
[1:27:39] for us to get to hear kind of like what
[1:27:42] we
[1:27:42] read but we get to hear it in our modern
[1:27:46] time
[1:27:51] and this would happen time after time
[1:27:54] after time thousands and maybe hundreds
[1:27:57] of thousands of times
[1:27:58] you can hear this
[1:28:02] and maybe when you hear that especially
[1:28:04] you young people you think yeah
[1:28:06] brother branham brother branham's tapes
[1:28:09] yeah
[1:28:11] but to the world that's not
[1:28:14] normal that's abnormal
[1:28:18] that's that's more than normal
[1:28:22] and really truly when you look at the
[1:28:25] world today
[1:28:26] even as believers when you see
[1:28:29] how that the world has left him on the
[1:28:32] outside
[1:28:35] how that the modern day church has put
[1:28:38] him
[1:28:38] on the outside he's he's knocking
[1:28:42] he's trying to get in but they've put
[1:28:45] him out
[1:28:51] and it's something that's so precious
[1:29:02] when you think about that man that was
[1:29:04] at that pool of bethesda
[1:29:08] and it just so happened that jesus came
[1:29:11] that way
[1:29:12] the father showed him to go that way
[1:29:17] and he asked the man
[1:29:20] what's the problem he says well the
[1:29:23] angel comes
[1:29:24] by and stirs the water and
[1:29:28] and before i can get into the water
[1:29:30] somebody beats me to it
[1:29:32] and he'd been he'd had an infirmity and
[1:29:35] brother branham said
[1:29:36] he wasn't dying of it he'd had it 38
[1:29:38] years or something like that
[1:29:41] but can you imagine for all those years
[1:29:44] he was there at that pool
[1:29:46] waiting for his moment to get into there
[1:29:52] and he was just looking forward to that
[1:29:54] water stirring again
[1:29:56] and it just so happened jesus came by
[1:29:59] and maybe he didn't know who jesus
[1:30:03] was if he'd
[1:30:06] only known that the god of heaven that
[1:30:09] his
[1:30:09] very creator was standing right next to
[1:30:13] him
[1:30:13] and was caring for the infirmity that he
[1:30:16] had
[1:30:19] and he as he asked him what seems to be
[1:30:21] wrong and he says well
[1:30:23] somebody beats me into the pool
[1:30:28] and jesus let him know that he was the
[1:30:32] life-giver
[1:30:34] that he was the source of health
[1:30:37] and he healed that man
[1:30:41] it might seem like a normal church
[1:30:44] service when you go to church and you
[1:30:45] get to hear the preaching of the word
[1:30:48] and it might just be good you might
[1:30:51] think those are good words
[1:30:53] they're he he presented himself so well
[1:30:56] and he read the scriptures so nicely and
[1:31:00] everything he said was true that was
[1:31:03] good but it's different when jesus comes
[1:31:10] it's not just words anymore
[1:31:13] when the spirit of god begins to move
[1:31:17] throughout the building and when he
[1:31:19] comes to you
[1:31:21] and you recognize it and you by
[1:31:24] faith can reach out and take hold of a
[1:31:28] promise
[1:31:28] and say god that's for me
[1:31:32] it does something different than just a
[1:31:35] normal preacher giving out words
[1:31:39] up on a platform it's something more
[1:31:42] when jesus comes
[1:31:44] by it's not just another house
[1:31:48] meeting it might seem chaotic it might
[1:31:51] seem you might seem restless and
[1:31:53] it might the men's the preacher's words
[1:31:55] might fall
[1:31:56] flat you think he just doesn't say words
[1:31:58] right but it doesn't matter when jesus
[1:32:01] comes by
[1:32:02] he does something different for us
[1:32:08] and i want to close with this
[1:32:13] in 1957 on march 3rd
[1:32:17] brother branham is preaching some
[1:32:20] services
[1:32:23] i believe he's in phoenix arizona i
[1:32:26] could be mistaken he might be here in
[1:32:28] tucson i'm not
[1:32:29] positive i believe he's in phoenix
[1:32:32] and he preaches a message what think ye
[1:32:35] of
[1:32:36] christ it's in the evening
[1:32:41] and he begins with the scriptures and he
[1:32:44] goes through the bible
[1:32:45] and he says let's take some examples and
[1:32:48] he speaks of
[1:32:50] of pontius pilate and he speaks
[1:32:54] of judas and he speaks of the roman
[1:32:57] soldier that pierced his side and each
[1:32:59] one of them he's
[1:33:00] dramatizing and he and he asks them
[1:33:03] judas
[1:33:04] if we could go down to hell he says and
[1:33:07] we could
[1:33:08] pull up the spirit of judas and say
[1:33:10] judas what think ye of christ
[1:33:13] he said i can hear pieces of silver
[1:33:16] rolling
[1:33:17] and jude is saying i betrayed innocent
[1:33:20] blood
[1:33:21] that was the son of god
[1:33:24] and he said if we could ask that roman
[1:33:27] soldier
[1:33:28] that pierced his side that roman soldier
[1:33:30] would say truly
[1:33:31] that was the son of god
[1:33:34] he said if we could go to pontius pilate
[1:33:37] and he
[1:33:38] he gives a dramatization of pontius
[1:33:40] pilate and how that his wife
[1:33:42] even came to him and said have no part
[1:33:44] to do with this man he's a righteous man
[1:33:47] this
[1:33:47] jesus of nazareth i had i for all night
[1:33:50] i dreamed of him and
[1:33:51] have nothing to do with him and how that
[1:33:53] pilot tried
[1:33:55] washing his natural hands of jesus but
[1:33:57] he couldn't get him off his hands
[1:34:01] and he said if we could ask pontius
[1:34:03] pilate what would he
[1:34:05] what do ye think of christ
[1:34:08] what think ye of christ he too would
[1:34:11] testify
[1:34:12] truly that was the son of god he says
[1:34:15] and then we would ask his friends and
[1:34:18] and and he goes through the the hebrew
[1:34:20] children he asked
[1:34:21] daniel he asks ezekiel all of them what
[1:34:25] thinking of christ and they
[1:34:26] all have got the profession that he is a
[1:34:30] living
[1:34:31] one true living god who came to me
[1:34:35] who saved my life
[1:34:41] and at the end of his sermon i'm not
[1:34:43] sure how long it was maybe
[1:34:45] an hour an hour and a half then again he
[1:34:48] calls a prayer line
[1:34:51] and i wanted to play a part of this
[1:34:54] for you just a small portion of this
[1:34:57] prayer line
[1:34:58] and i just wanted you to just get a
[1:35:01] glimpse just
[1:35:02] a snapshot of this and
[1:35:05] i believe if our brothers have that they
[1:35:08] can
[1:35:09] play that
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:23] babies in christ do you
[1:35:26] solemnly understand
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:30] that the lord jesus you accepted a few
[1:35:33] minutes ago
[1:35:34] is right here now do you
[1:35:37] see what that was dealing with your
[1:35:39] heart
[1:35:41] it was christ here he is up here moving
[1:35:45] on a platform visible
[1:35:46] not in behind dark curtains or somewhere
[1:35:48] else right here before you people
[1:35:52] god doesn't go behind dark curtains to
[1:35:54] deal
[1:35:56] that's a perverted spirit
[1:35:59] and what is what is a perverted spirit
[1:36:03] one that should be righteous perverted
[1:36:05] to do wrong
[1:36:12] now the lady the lady
[1:36:16] she
[1:36:19] no i thought she was deaf
[1:36:23] but you can't speak english you've come
[1:36:26] to interpret for her
[1:36:28] right
[1:36:32] speak to her did i speak
[1:36:36] do you believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:36:41] do you believe me to be his prophet
[1:36:45] if god will tell me what you are here
[1:36:49] for
[1:36:49] will you receive it
[1:36:56] now you know that i don't know you
[1:37:03] i can't even speak your language
[1:37:08] but the god of heaven
[1:37:12] speaks all language
[1:37:18] you are here wanting me to pray for you
[1:37:24] for a growth if that is right raise up
[1:37:28] your hand
[1:37:32] that growth is
[1:37:36] on your left breath
[1:37:40] if that's right wave your hands
[1:37:49] and this is your husband
[1:37:54] and you want prayer for him
[1:37:58] because he's got a skin disease
[1:38:02] that is right
[1:38:06] then you want prayer for a son
[1:38:11] and the reason you want prayer for him
[1:38:15] is because he walks in his sleeve
[1:38:18] with his eyes open
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:34] does thou believe on the son of god
[1:38:44] now surely that would settle mental
[1:38:46] telepathy for you
[1:38:51] now what a remarkable thing
[1:38:56] and that happened thousands and hundreds
[1:38:59] of thousands of time
[1:39:02] and you think oh how wonderful for that
[1:39:04] person
[1:39:06] how wonderful and yet i've heard
[1:39:08] thousands of those
[1:39:10] but that's a piece of a story and i'd
[1:39:12] like to give you the rest of the story
[1:39:18] that was a man and a woman a husband and
[1:39:21] wife that came up before brother branham
[1:39:23] and they
[1:39:23] both spoke spanish the wife only spoke
[1:39:27] spanish he didn't speak english at all
[1:39:30] and so the husband came to interpret for
[1:39:32] his wife
[1:39:36] the man's name was robert the wife's
[1:39:38] name was maria
[1:39:42] and she came up and his brother brandon
[1:39:45] begins to
[1:39:46] speak to her you through her husband the
[1:39:49] interpreter
[1:39:51] she had a growth on her breast and the
[1:39:53] skin disease
[1:39:54] that robert had was he would wear
[1:39:57] boots rubber boots a lot i think because
[1:40:00] of his work
[1:40:01] and because of the boots he had a
[1:40:03] reaction to those boots
[1:40:05] and it caused a skin condition that he
[1:40:08] would have on his legs and he would
[1:40:09] scratch his legs till they would bleed
[1:40:13] now their son's name was julio
[1:40:16] and julio walked in his sleep
[1:40:20] and his eyes would be open and he would
[1:40:21] go throughout the house and many a times
[1:40:23] he would hurt himself
[1:40:25] and so the parents were concerned for
[1:40:27] him and they desired that
[1:40:29] god would heal him of that sleeping
[1:40:32] walk sleep walking
[1:40:36] now brother branham's discerning all of
[1:40:38] this and
[1:40:40] he's asking her is that right about the
[1:40:44] growth on your breast she says that's
[1:40:46] right
[1:40:48] he says and your husband has a skin
[1:40:50] disease is that right that's right
[1:40:52] and your son
[1:40:56] walks in his sleep with his eyes open
[1:40:58] and
[1:40:59] as he says that the reason you hear her
[1:41:03] scream
[1:41:05] without delay before he finishes that
[1:41:08] statement
[1:41:09] is because she heard brother branham say
[1:41:12] those words
[1:41:13] in her own language she didn't need an
[1:41:17] interpreter for that
[1:41:19] god who speaks all languages
[1:41:23] was able to cause the voice of the
[1:41:26] prophet
[1:41:27] to be heard in spanish to that
[1:41:30] sister now
[1:41:33] they went home that night and they went
[1:41:37] to bed believing
[1:41:38] god for the very promise he gave
[1:41:42] through the mouthpiece of his prophet
[1:41:45] and as they were laying in bed that
[1:41:47] night in the middle of the night
[1:41:49] brother robert woke up for some strange
[1:41:53] reason
[1:41:54] and he looked down and julio slept at
[1:41:56] the foot of their bed
[1:41:58] and while he was looking down he saw
[1:42:01] julio
[1:42:02] sit up like he normally did before he
[1:42:05] went
[1:42:06] sleepwalking and when he sat up as if he
[1:42:09] was going to start sleepwalking again
[1:42:11] brother robert said in the name of
[1:42:15] jesus christ i command you
[1:42:18] lay back down and just as soon as julio
[1:42:21] sat
[1:42:22] up julio laid right back down
[1:42:25] went to sleep and never slept walked
[1:42:28] after that moment
[1:42:30] now it took robert brother robert
[1:42:33] believing
[1:42:34] that what god's prophet said was true
[1:42:38] even if it didn't come to pass at the
[1:42:40] moment he said it in that prayer line
[1:42:42] he knew that what he said was true and
[1:42:45] that it would come to pass
[1:42:47] if god promised it and that night that's
[1:42:50] why he could say
[1:42:51] in the name of jesus christ lay back
[1:42:55] down
[1:42:55] and it never happened again he had faith
[1:42:58] enough to take hold of that
[1:43:00] now you say how brother do you know the
[1:43:03] rest of that story
[1:43:04] because that was robert and maria
[1:43:07] figueroa
[1:43:08] and their grandson bobby figueroa
[1:43:11] is a good friend of mine who's right
[1:43:13] here in tucson arizona tonight
[1:43:17] and you can ask him about that testimony
[1:43:20] and i told him this evening
[1:43:22] i'll be testifying of your grandparents
[1:43:25] tonight
[1:43:26] and he said they'll be looking over the
[1:43:29] banisters of heaven
[1:43:30] listening to you this evening and he
[1:43:32] said hebrews 13
[1:43:34] 8 jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:43:37] today and forever and brothers and
[1:43:40] sisters i'm closing
[1:43:42] by saying this that's a normal
[1:43:45] church service for when jesus
[1:43:48] comes by things are different they're no
[1:43:51] longer words
[1:43:53] only but they're promises from the
[1:43:55] throne of heaven
[1:43:57] to you personally and if your
[1:44:00] faith can take hold of the promises of
[1:44:03] god
[1:44:03] and say that's true i believe that
[1:44:06] for me you can have what you asked for
[1:44:19] and as i spoke this very thing on
[1:44:22] this last sunday and we were praying
[1:44:27] at the end of the service an older
[1:44:30] gentleman who had a back
[1:44:31] problem came to me after service and
[1:44:33] said while you were praying
[1:44:36] the lord jesus touched my back and
[1:44:38] healed me
[1:44:41] brothers and sisters that's got nothing
[1:44:44] to do with me
[1:44:45] that's got to do with you and our
[1:44:48] heavenly father
[1:44:49] our lord and savior jesus christ
[1:44:52] and i believe that for each and every
[1:44:55] one of his children not only here in
[1:44:57] tucson
[1:44:58] but wheresoever this promise
[1:45:01] is for you for your children and for
[1:45:04] them
[1:45:04] even as many as far off as the lord our
[1:45:08] god
[1:45:08] shall call those promises
[1:45:11] are for or for those who would believe
[1:45:15] and act upon it
[1:45:19] amen now
[1:45:22] may our services never
[1:45:26] ever be the same again i pray that
[1:45:30] every time we gather together in the
[1:45:32] name of jesus christ
[1:45:34] whether it's in this building in our
[1:45:36] houses
[1:45:37] on the job site in our cars riding
[1:45:40] together wherever that would be
[1:45:42] if jesus would come by things would
[1:45:45] change in our life may god grant it
[1:45:48] let's stand together and pray
[1:45:55] the musicians would come
[1:45:59] play something softly perhaps he is here
[1:46:02] hallelujah he is here
[1:46:06] amen i want to pray with you this
[1:46:09] evening and you pray in your own way
[1:46:13] our lovely lord jesus

[1:46:23] are sick

[1:46:50] if you could get the people to believe
[1:46:52] you
