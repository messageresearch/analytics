[35:37] amen how many made that reservation

[35:44] amen he was wounded for our
[35:47] transgressions
[35:49] [Music]
[35:51] isaiah chapter 53 verses four and five
[35:56] if you could put that out
[35:59] as we bring the needs
[36:02] [Music]
[36:05] surely he has borne our griefs and
[36:07] carried our sorrows
[36:09] yet we did esteem him stricken
[36:13] cementing of god and afflicted we didn't
[36:16] know that it was for us
[36:18] we thought he was being punished by god
[36:22] but he was wounded for our
[36:23] transgressions and he was bruised for
[36:26] our iniquities
[36:27] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[36:29] him
[36:31] and with his stripes we are healed
[36:34] that's a promise of god and he keeps his
[36:36] word so
[36:38] we'll stand on that we do have some
[36:40] needs to bring to your attention and
[36:43] let's continue to remember our brother
[36:45] julio figueroa spoke to his family this
[36:48] morning
[36:49] and brother julio has stopped taking the
[36:52] chemotherapy
[36:54] it had been affecting him quite severely
[36:57] doctors told him it was a brave move but
[36:59] it's something he should do
[37:01] and sister his daughter sister grace
[37:04] told me that he started eating again and
[37:06] he's feeling much better
[37:07] so god knows how to heal
[37:10] because he's already provided and
[37:12] sometimes we want it done a certain way
[37:14] but god knows
[37:15] how he's going to do that
[37:17] [Music]
[37:18] i got a text from brother tony ramirez
[37:20] and he's been having some complications
[37:22] with his blood pressures and things and
[37:24] just asked that we would remember him in
[37:26] prayer
[37:29] and then just continue remember brother
[37:31] al peterson brother arne mentioned that
[37:33] he was still having
[37:34] some difficulties but was doing better
[37:36] so let's continue to remember brother al
[37:39] and also if you got the whatsapp you saw
[37:42] the request for brother dan roberts
[37:44] was taken to the hospital and then the
[37:47] praise that the
[37:48] the cut had had healed itself
[37:51] and this morning brother ed text him and
[37:54] brother dan said the doctor said he
[37:56] would be in the hospital six more days
[37:58] before he could be released but the
[38:00] healing process had already begun
[38:03] so we're praising god and we're thanking
[38:05] him for that
[38:09] we'll do that and this morning also
[38:12] sister amelia had asked for prayer
[38:14] and sister connie carey and to be
[38:17] anointed
[38:18] with oil and brother dan has has chose
[38:21] to do that
[38:22] at the end of service and our sister
[38:25] connie had requested some of your
[38:27] sisters to come up and stand with her in
[38:29] prayer so
[38:30] that would be perfectly fine so we'll do
[38:32] that at the end of service i spoke to
[38:34] both of them and let them know
[38:36] so if you'll stand with me
[38:42] raise your hand and say i have a need i
[38:44] have a desire
[38:46] and i raise my other hand because i
[38:47] believe the lord he's a healer
[38:50] he was wounded for my transgression he
[38:52] was moves for my iniquities lord we
[38:55] we raise our hands because we do have
[38:57] needs lord and
[38:59] but we know that you supply all our
[39:01] needs lord
[39:03] so with one hand we raise and we say
[39:05] lord i need you and with the other hand
[39:06] we say thank you lord for meeting our
[39:08] needs lord we believe
[39:10] you know every desire every heart maybe
[39:13] we
[39:14] couldn't put it in words maybe we
[39:15] couldn't write it down just
[39:17] something inside of us is crying out
[39:19] lord
[39:20] but we just know that you've taken care
[39:22] of him we thank you for it lord
[39:24] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[39:27] you may be seated
[39:29] a couple of praises from our sister
[39:33] elizabeth
[39:33] guerra my my sister-in-law says i would
[39:37] like to thank the lord for his
[39:38] goodness and the saints for their
[39:40] prayers i successfully completed
[39:43] my training so amen
[39:48] i've always said ask him
[39:51] he'll do it yeah it's the same
[39:55] i'd also like to congratulate my mom and
[39:57] dad
[39:59] 66 years of marriage yesterday i
[40:02] appreciate that
[40:06] a good testimony to the family talking
[40:09] to
[40:10] i think it was sarah yesterday a little
[40:11] bit and she said
[40:13] to have the marriage of my grandparents
[40:16] for 66 years and the marriage of my
[40:19] parents for almost 42 years
[40:21] what a blessing sometimes we take things
[40:24] for granted
[40:25] but god sure is good and merciful to us
[40:29] we appreciate all that he's done for us
[40:31] and he's never left us
[40:34] never been a time that we were left
[40:36] alone to drift on our own but he's
[40:38] watched over us he's cared for us so
[40:40] i think that so just uh make
[40:44] an announcement how we're going to be
[40:46] proceeding forward here
[40:48] for the next month to the end of march
[40:52] maybe into early april we had
[40:56] a meeting with brother daniel andes
[40:58] yesterday
[41:00] myself brother jordan brother ed and
[41:03] brother arne
[41:04] to discuss how we would like to go
[41:08] forward
[41:10] so brother daniel is going to be with us
[41:12] today tonight
[41:14] and wednesday and he will be
[41:18] assuming the duties of a pastor to begin
[41:21] so that we can begin to know him and and
[41:24] see how
[41:25] what his heart is and he can begin to
[41:28] know how we are
[41:29] even more then he has the following two
[41:33] weekends he has some obligations that he
[41:35] has to take care of
[41:36] it's already made in ministering for
[41:38] brother dale smith up in flagstaff
[41:41] next weekend and the following weekend
[41:43] is brother brad burch's birthday so he's
[41:46] part of that's his pastor so it's part
[41:48] of that
[41:49] and then he will be coming back and
[41:51] staying with us through the end of march
[41:53] possibly into early early
[41:57] april and assuming
[42:00] and starting today assuming the role of
[42:02] an interim pastor
[42:04] so that we have that opportunity to work
[42:07] with him
[42:08] and and share those things so you keep
[42:11] him in prayer
[42:13] and again i remind you god has never
[42:15] left us
[42:16] sometimes we wonder what are you doing
[42:19] lord
[42:20] and he says i'm performing what i have
[42:22] desired for you
[42:23] and bringing it to pass so
[42:27] we will be having communion service
[42:29] tonight and foot washing
[42:31] we have made the arrangements to for
[42:35] individual cups and things just to to
[42:38] and
[42:38] speaking with brother daniel about these
[42:40] things to do it in a way that is
[42:42] as safest as we can so he said something
[42:46] and i'm just gonna
[42:47] it just caught me yesterday because
[42:51] communion time comes and i've heard many
[42:54] say well i've
[42:55] i've got to check my life closely i've
[42:57] got to and
[42:58] and people get nervous about it but he
[43:01] put it in a way that maybe
[43:03] i never thought about this way and he
[43:06] said if you're not ready for communion
[43:08] you're not ready for the rapture
[43:13] it puts it in a place so
[43:16] get ready pretty simple get ready
[43:20] all that you can do to be ready be ready
[43:23] so
[43:24] we'll let brother daniel take the
[43:26] service here
[43:27] if we'll stand but
[43:31] that that's how we've chosen to proceed
[43:34] as the congregation voted last sunday

[50:59] man you believe all things work together
[51:01] for good
[51:03] you know it's the truth whether we
[51:04] believe it or not
[51:06] got to get to the place that we believe
[51:08] the word of god
[51:09] amen is it all right if i walk down
[51:11] there
[51:13] i i feel like i'm so far away from you
[51:16] all
[51:17] i like to be close to people and
[51:21] and i just uh i don't know how this
[51:23] morning
[51:24] this will if i could just talk to you
[51:26] maybe not preach to you is that okay
[51:29] sometimes i see people that want to be a
[51:32] minister and i say you know paul never
[51:34] had a microphone in his hand
[51:36] and most of his ministry was in a prison
[51:38] down in a dungeon somewhere
[51:40] in his mind he thought i'd be a much
[51:42] better preacher if i wasn't in this
[51:43] dungeon but he wrote most of the book
[51:46] the new testament so as that song said
[51:49] god's doing
[51:50] something amen he's got our lives are in
[51:52] his hands
[51:54] let's just pray together heavenly father
[51:58] lord we love you today and lord as the
[52:01] song says we're right in your hands
[52:03] father
[52:04] we love you and we just commit our lives
[52:06] to you and pray lord as we would talk a
[52:08] little bit this morning that you would
[52:10] take the scriptures that we read the
[52:12] thought on our heart and
[52:14] as i express my heart lord i pray that
[52:17] you would just help
[52:18] us father and strengthen us you know
[52:20] where each one of us are in our lives i
[52:22] pray you'd help us now
[52:23] in jesus name amen
[52:26] amen it's good to see some of our
[52:28] friends if i start mentioning all our
[52:29] friends
[52:30] brother wilson hembree god bless you and
[52:32] our sister i know brother howard cyril
[52:34] well he's a good friend of ours and
[52:36] his sister yarborough god bless you i
[52:39] could go down the road just start
[52:40] mentioning all of you brother johnson
[52:42] brother lyle and sister heather god
[52:43] bless you i know you've been working
[52:45] hard for the lord
[52:46] god bless you it's good to see brother
[52:48] peter this morning i just saw him
[52:49] briefly and
[52:52] so i just i want to thank the brothers
[52:54] again for inviting us
[52:56] and and we talked about some things and
[52:59] i i just thought we'd maybe talk about a
[53:00] couple things if that's okay
[53:03] i want to tell you who i am i'm just a
[53:06] sinner saved by grace
[53:08] i'm i believe jesus christ died on the
[53:12] cross for our sins
[53:14] he's my savior i believe god sent a
[53:17] prophet
[53:17] because the bible said that he would
[53:19] send a prophet just before
[53:21] the coming of the lord he was sent
[53:22] elijah the prophet that's why we believe
[53:24] this message because the bible
[53:26] said it would come and we believe it got
[53:28] to believe the bible
[53:31] so i'm 52 years old my wife is 52 years
[53:34] old
[53:36] i we've been married 33 years we're not
[53:38] to the 66 yet brother
[53:41] larry but we're coming if the lord
[53:43] tarries
[53:45] we've got three boys we've raised three
[53:47] boys most of you know william
[53:49] he sings and my son ethan he's married
[53:52] he just had his second child and then
[53:53] i've got an older son
[53:54] isaac and he just had a first grandchild
[53:58] i've lived in jeffersonville area 51
[54:00] years
[54:01] i moved there when i was 2 years old so
[54:04] i've lived there most of my life
[54:06] when i was 2 years old we moved there as
[54:07] i said and
[54:09] and i started attending the branham
[54:12] tabernacle my father
[54:13] started working at the spoken word in
[54:16] the uh
[54:18] so for 35 years my father was a
[54:20] transcriber from the
[54:21] the sermons brother random to the book
[54:23] so
[54:24] 35 years he did that and the table app
[54:28] and those things now they took that text
[54:30] and
[54:30] scanned it and put it in the computer
[54:32] that we search and use it now that was
[54:33] my father's
[54:34] a lot of his original work and when i
[54:37] was 17 years old i started working for
[54:39] the spoken word
[54:40] and working with brother joseph branham
[54:41] for 13 years i gave my life to help
[54:43] brother joseph take this message around
[54:45] the world
[54:46] because i believe this message god sent
[54:48] this message behold i
[54:50] jesus christ jehovah the old testament
[54:53] is jesus of the new jesus christ sent to
[54:55] me
[54:56] elijah the prophet and i believe that
[54:58] because it's written in the bible so i
[55:00] gave 13 years to help
[55:01] brother joseph do that i appreciate
[55:03] brother joseph branham what he's doing
[55:05] around the world to take this message to
[55:07] the people
[55:07] i don't have the ability or the
[55:09] resources to do it so i say god bless my
[55:11] brother he's
[55:12] sending that around the world may god
[55:14] bless him
[55:15] recently so we started helping brother
[55:19] burgess when we were young we were 19
[55:20] years old we got it
[55:21] started helping brother brad burgess
[55:23] when i was 19
[55:24] he had started a church had it for a few
[55:27] years
[55:28] and so we started helping him my wife
[55:29] and i and she became the sunday school
[55:31] teacher i think for 26
[55:33] 27 years 28 years she was a sunday
[55:35] school teacher
[55:36] i teach the sunday school class now she
[55:39] teaches 5-10 i speak
[55:40] preach teach 10 to 15.
[55:44] and so just recently the lord's put on
[55:46] our heart to minister more and
[55:48] to minister the word of god we've been
[55:50] involved in a lot of things in support
[55:52] and
[55:53] in our church and and so we've had the
[55:55] burden to preach more i don't know where
[55:57] that is if that's evangelism
[55:59] or if that's at my home church or if
[56:01] there's at another church and so i'm
[56:03] just trying to take one step at a time
[56:05] to
[56:06] follow the lord and so when the brothers
[56:08] called me and said
[56:09] would you consider helping us for a
[56:11] little bit we prayed about it and
[56:13] we met with the brothers yesterday and i
[56:16] want to say i didn't call them they
[56:18] called me
[56:19] so i this is not like brother daniel
[56:22] they called me and said would you come
[56:24] so that's why i'm here today
[56:26] and so we talked and i've just got a
[56:28] little window with
[56:30] my work and things that we could take
[56:31] some a few weeks here
[56:33] and maybe just try to be here and you
[56:35] could get to know me and i could get to
[56:36] know you
[56:38] i can tell you i only have one motive as
[56:40] a minister and that sees souls
[56:43] prepare their heart to go in a rapture
[56:45] to me that's what a minister's job is to
[56:48] have people prepared to meet the lord
[56:51] jesus christ
[56:53] and so i've never pastored before i
[56:55] don't know
[56:56] our heart has been with the young people
[56:58] in our church and
[56:59] so we very young age got in they
[57:01] actually evicted us out of our house
[57:03] because my wife was having so many
[57:04] tutoring
[57:06] students they were homeschooling and
[57:07] piano students they said you can't have
[57:09] this many people at your house
[57:11] and and so they kicked us out we said
[57:13] we're gonna have them at our house and
[57:15] so we had them and
[57:16] so now today a lot of those young people
[57:19] one is the head deacon the other deacon
[57:21] his wife is one that we helped the piano
[57:23] players the one that my wife gave piano
[57:25] lessons so
[57:26] god has blessed those efforts and
[57:29] i don't know and i was as the brothers i
[57:32] just was very candid with the brothers
[57:33] yesterday and just said you know
[57:35] i think it's only fair that we maybe do
[57:37] this for a period of time
[57:39] and then we maybe just withdraw
[57:40] ourselves and you all pray and we pray i
[57:42] believe god works on both ends
[57:45] and if the lord would have us to
[57:47] continue then god would put it on both
[57:49] of our hearts
[57:49] and if it would we would go a different
[57:52] direction and you just say hey you're
[57:54] too much of an evangelist for us we want
[57:56] to settle
[57:57] you know then then we would just pray is
[58:00] that fair would you raise your hand is
[58:01] that prayer
[58:02] if you agree with me we just take some
[58:04] time i believe god works on both ends of
[58:06] the line
[58:08] however and i might mention some things
[58:10] through there through my message that
[58:12] you know as a shepherd to guide us
[58:15] through sometimes we're in a pandemic
[58:17] now
[58:17] we've never been through one of these
[58:18] before i think i haven't i know brother
[58:21] branham if you go back
[58:22] and study in 1957 he went through one
[58:25] he was in a he read it he came out west
[58:28] to go hunting he loved to go hunting he
[58:29] said we got so sick we didn't even take
[58:31] our guns out we just put our
[58:32] guns back in he drove back to indiana
[58:34] and he was sick with
[58:36] the flu i forget which one of the flu's
[58:38] maybe you've studied it but it's 1957 he
[58:40] mentions it twice that he got it and he
[58:42] just
[58:43] you know got it got and he moved on god
[58:45] was his healer and i believe god is our
[58:46] healer
[58:47] do you believe that how many of my
[58:49] friends got sick he didn't say you
[58:50] wouldn't get sick he said i'm the lord
[58:52] heals all of your sicknesses and all of
[58:54] your diseases
[58:56] we don't live in fear we live in faith
[58:58] amen
[58:59] however i do believe that at some age a
[59:01] person is more susceptible
[59:03] and i believe if you feel that you need
[59:05] to make
[59:06] wear a mask or don't shake hands you
[59:08] want to do a fist bump
[59:09] feel free you don't is that is that okay
[59:12] in each one just do what you feel is
[59:14] best
[59:15] kind of for you i think that's that's
[59:17] fair to us
[59:18] and each one of us we should have that
[59:20] respect for one another
[59:22] the brothers we talked about having
[59:23] communion
[59:25] the bible tells us there's only three
[59:27] ordinances that jesus left for us
[59:29] one was water baptism one was foot
[59:31] washing and one was communion
[59:33] so the brothers the elders were together
[59:35] and saying how can we make this possible
[59:37] and so they may be a little bit
[59:39] different i think when jesus was serving
[59:41] the wine the objective was to take the
[59:43] wine and to put it into their body and
[59:45] take the bread and put it into their
[59:46] body
[59:47] so maybe a little bit different the
[59:48] brothers have talked and have the
[59:50] individual cups that we'll use
[59:52] tonight and just try to be aware of our
[59:55] surroundings and minimize our exposure
[59:57] so they've taken some precautions
[59:59] and i think it would be good as they'll
[1:00:01] all be together
[1:00:02] and take communion the other thing that
[1:00:04] we talked about this morning is as we go
[1:00:07] or yesterday as we go through a time as
[1:00:09] a church family
[1:00:11] sometimes you go through things as a
[1:00:12] family you don't tell everybody
[1:00:14] and maybe your husband or wife and you
[1:00:16] retreat and
[1:00:18] and and you go through it and you pray
[1:00:20] together and you work through it and
[1:00:21] then you come back out and you minister
[1:00:23] and you do those things and so as a
[1:00:24] church family as we go through these
[1:00:26] things
[1:00:27] i'm not interested in everybody in
[1:00:29] florida and new york and flor
[1:00:30] and africa knowing what we're going
[1:00:32] through
[1:00:34] is that fair so the brothers have
[1:00:36] streaming to those that are a part of
[1:00:38] our church
[1:00:39] and we talked about when the service is
[1:00:41] going on those that want to
[1:00:42] live stream or be on the phone and see
[1:00:45] and be a part of the church they're
[1:00:46] welcome to
[1:00:48] and then maybe just take that so it's
[1:00:49] not public it's not a public link
[1:00:52] so that anybody that at the church time
[1:00:54] would want to either be in the service
[1:00:56] or virtually join the service they could
[1:00:57] but then it wouldn't be available
[1:00:59] after that you know we go through this
[1:01:01] time
[1:01:02] and i share my heart to you i'm not
[1:01:05] interested in florida and new zealand
[1:01:06] and everybody
[1:01:07] talking about what we're going through
[1:01:09] we're going through it and we'll go
[1:01:10] through it and we'll get through it
[1:01:12] amen is that fair so talk to the
[1:01:15] the elders they if you have questions
[1:01:17] about that
[1:01:18] you know it's back home we talk about
[1:01:19] things that said man we're just trying
[1:01:21] to get through this thing
[1:01:22] and when it first came out the pandemic
[1:01:24] and a lot of things going on and said
[1:01:26] man
[1:01:26] we're just trying to get through this
[1:01:28] we're doing the best that we can i don't
[1:01:29] know
[1:01:30] even what the laws are here back home we
[1:01:32] had indiana kentucky you go to church
[1:01:34] in kentucky we lived in indiana and
[1:01:36] kentucky and indiana the governors were
[1:01:38] shutting down and back and forth and i
[1:01:40] said man they can't even figure out the
[1:01:42] health professionals can't figure it out
[1:01:44] i'm just trying to get through this
[1:01:45] tell me what to do i'll do it but we're
[1:01:48] just trying to get through it amen
[1:01:49] that's like life i was born one day
[1:01:52] i'm gonna die one day and i'm just
[1:01:53] trying to get through it
[1:01:55] and i was a sinner back here i'm a
[1:01:57] preacher here right and there was this
[1:01:59] man called jesus christ i heard the
[1:02:01] story of an old rugged cross
[1:02:03] and i believed in it and it took the
[1:02:05] weight of sin off my
[1:02:06] shoulders and delivered me from that
[1:02:09] can you say amen this is more than a
[1:02:12] theory this is something you experience
[1:02:14] this is not a 2 000 year old story i try
[1:02:17] to convince you to believe it's
[1:02:18] something you experience
[1:02:20] listen to me now and then after that
[1:02:22] happened there was two thousand
[1:02:24] six thousand denominations that held the
[1:02:26] same bible and said we're
[1:02:27] we're right we're the truth i said oh
[1:02:29] god what do i do
[1:02:30] and then behold i send you elijah the
[1:02:32] prophet god sent
[1:02:34] me a prophet remember this is just
[1:02:36] personal
[1:02:37] great cradle grave journey
[1:02:40] i met jesus christ and now in my journey
[1:02:42] i say lord what do i do
[1:02:44] and god rich in mercy before i was ever
[1:02:47] born had a promise written in the
[1:02:49] scripture
[1:02:49] had william branham that came and went
[1:02:52] and had a message stored up on tapes for
[1:02:54] me
[1:02:55] this is a personal thing this is i love
[1:02:58] us
[1:02:59] but this is me it's me on a journey from
[1:03:01] the cr and everyone you young people
[1:03:03] each one is brother johnson we're on a
[1:03:05] journey i'm just trying to make it from
[1:03:07] the cradle to the grave
[1:03:09] and while i was going through something
[1:03:10] came along to help me
[1:03:12] is that fair and i began to hear the
[1:03:15] revelation of jesus christ and
[1:03:17] the things and i said you know lord that
[1:03:19] makes sense serpent seed
[1:03:21] lord that makes sense the prophet says
[1:03:24] god didn't come to save the devil's
[1:03:25] children he came to save his children
[1:03:27] and lord i'm one of your children and he
[1:03:29] saves me and he changes me
[1:03:32] and so we're trying to get through this
[1:03:35] amen
[1:03:36] i gotta i think you're supposed to read
[1:03:37] a text before you start preaching but
[1:03:39] when you're a preacher you're just a
[1:03:40] preacher
[1:03:42] let's just stand together and maybe read
[1:03:45] over in the bible if you have your
[1:03:47] bibles revelations chapter 3
[1:03:51] i'm going to try to be short i know we
[1:03:54] have a couple people that wanted to be
[1:03:56] prayed for we're going to try to do that
[1:03:59] in just a few minutes
[1:04:02] amen let's pray
[1:04:06] father we just asked now as we read your
[1:04:08] word that you would help us lord
[1:04:10] we're totally dependent on you we have
[1:04:13] no ability of ourself
[1:04:15] we surrender ourselves to you and pray
[1:04:17] that you would speak to us
[1:04:18] in jesus name amen revelations chapter 3
[1:04:22] verse 14
[1:04:25] i'm just going to read a couple of
[1:04:28] verses here
[1:04:28] revelations 3 verse 14 the bible says i
[1:04:31] know thy works
[1:04:33] that thou art neither cold nor hot i
[1:04:37] would that thou were cold nor hot
[1:04:39] so then because thou art lukewarm i will
[1:04:41] spew and neither cold nor hot i will
[1:04:43] spew the out of my
[1:04:46] mouth just for the sake of time let's go
[1:04:48] to verse 20.
[1:04:50] actually let's read verse 19. as many as
[1:04:52] i love i rebuke
[1:04:54] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[1:04:56] repent
[1:04:57] so contrary to our culture that says if
[1:05:01] you correct your child
[1:05:03] in an abrupt way you don't love them the
[1:05:06] bible says
[1:05:06] if i chasten you and i rebuke you it's
[1:05:09] because i do
[1:05:10] love you it's one of the greatest
[1:05:12] evidence that you're a son of god so if
[1:05:13] we open the bible
[1:05:15] and something just smites you and
[1:05:17] corrects you
[1:05:19] don't run away from it embrace it say
[1:05:21] lord i must be your child
[1:05:24] and we're not talking about an opinion
[1:05:26] of man but we're talking about the bible
[1:05:28] jesus if it is what's correct as a
[1:05:30] minister i
[1:05:31] i what we teach comes from the bible and
[1:05:34] if it corrects us then just say lord i'm
[1:05:36] your child you're correcting me
[1:05:38] verse 20 behold i stand at the door
[1:05:41] knock
[1:05:42] and if any man hear my voice and open
[1:05:44] the door i will
[1:05:46] come in to him and will sup with him and
[1:05:48] he
[1:05:49] with me to him that overcometh will that
[1:05:51] grant to sit with me and my throne even
[1:05:53] as i overcome
[1:05:54] and sat down with my father in his
[1:05:56] throne he that hath the near let him
[1:05:58] hear what the spirit saith
[1:05:59] to the churches amen you may be seated
[1:06:02] may god add his blessing to the reading
[1:06:04] of the word i want to just speak for a
[1:06:07] few minutes this morning
[1:06:08] on revival in me revival
[1:06:12] in me and i could have said revival in
[1:06:15] us
[1:06:16] but there's something about coming to
[1:06:17] the house of the lord that i feel like
[1:06:19] that we need to
[1:06:20] you know i preach so much against
[1:06:22] selfishness but when you come to the
[1:06:23] house of the lord it's time to be a
[1:06:24] little bit selfish
[1:06:26] and say lord i need a touch from you
[1:06:29] i need a filling of the spirit lord i
[1:06:32] need encouragement i need
[1:06:33] uplifted and i believe you know when you
[1:06:36] go to the doctor
[1:06:37] it's nice when he's taking care of other
[1:06:38] people but it comes to time like
[1:06:40] hey i'm here i need you lord
[1:06:43] and that's what i believe as we come to
[1:06:45] the house of the lord i want to speak on
[1:06:46] this revival in me and i was
[1:06:48] thinking uh you know because there's
[1:06:51] many messages i went in my office the
[1:06:52] other day and you're going to arizona
[1:06:54] and i'm old school
[1:06:55] just for some different reasons and so i
[1:06:58] have a lot of sermons there's probably
[1:07:00] three or four hundred sermons on my
[1:07:02] my my office there and i look like so i
[1:07:05] just went through a few of my like well
[1:07:06] maybe i would speak on those
[1:07:08] so i brought maybe ten stuck them in my
[1:07:10] bag and i'm coming down here i'm sitting
[1:07:11] on the plane
[1:07:12] and the holy spirit just starts dealing
[1:07:14] with me and i pull a bay out of my bag
[1:07:16] and i just start writing and
[1:07:18] holy spirits and everybody's around me
[1:07:20] we're flying 30
[1:07:21] 000 feet and i'm writing down lord i
[1:07:22] think that this is what you want to say
[1:07:24] this is what you want to say it'd be so
[1:07:27] easy just to go grab
[1:07:29] my notes and preach a two-hour sermon
[1:07:31] but maybe that's not what god wants
[1:07:33] the bible says as many as are led by the
[1:07:35] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[1:07:38] do you want to be a spirit-led church
[1:07:41] lord let the holy spirit
[1:07:43] that's why a lot of people don't want
[1:07:44] the holy spirit in the church because
[1:07:46] they don't want him to say whatever he
[1:07:48] wants to say
[1:07:49] but we don't want to be like that we
[1:07:51] want to be like ananias and sapphira
[1:07:52] lord
[1:07:53] say it lord help us and if there's sin
[1:07:56] in my life lord don't call it out in the
[1:07:58] church just come and talk to me first
[1:08:00] and lord i'll repent of it i'll make it
[1:08:03] right lord i
[1:08:05] you know and so i was just thinking
[1:08:06] about that i was writing on the plane
[1:08:08] and the holy spirit gave me this little
[1:08:09] thought
[1:08:10] and i was reading in the message how can
[1:08:12] i overcome brother branham said i was
[1:08:14] crossing the log the other day down a
[1:08:15] little wash or
[1:08:17] outside and i jumped up on a log on and
[1:08:20] i looked and
[1:08:21] it was a good old beach log but when i
[1:08:23] jumped on a big
[1:08:24] hunk of it fell off and it was rotten
[1:08:26] and dodie and i said that's the way
[1:08:28] christians are becoming this is a
[1:08:31] prophet he's out in the woods just
[1:08:32] hunting
[1:08:32] and he's getting a sermon by jumping on
[1:08:34] a log and his log
[1:08:36] collapses he said that's the way
[1:08:38] christians are becoming
[1:08:40] i know there's some that aren't that way
[1:08:42] i sister sarah sat in a parking lot the
[1:08:44] old day
[1:08:45] the whole night the friday night and i'm
[1:08:47] sure she was praying while we were
[1:08:48] sitting in a car not knowing the future
[1:08:50] but now we're not dody christians we
[1:08:52] don't want to be like that log we want
[1:08:53] to be like a strong tree
[1:08:55] how david say it in psalms 1 he shall be
[1:08:57] like a tree planted
[1:08:59] a strong tree that amen it has substance
[1:09:02] it's not
[1:09:03] dead a doty log but the brother man said
[1:09:05] this is the way christians are becoming
[1:09:07] they are dead and sin and trespasses so
[1:09:09] long till they become doty they can hold
[1:09:10] no weight at all
[1:09:12] they don't know what the overcome means
[1:09:15] i begin to think on this text overcome
[1:09:18] he said keep
[1:09:18] life in you keep life in you
[1:09:22] when life goes out that what brought the
[1:09:24] log to that condition it was made worse
[1:09:25] than it
[1:09:26] ever when it was laid in the branch
[1:09:28] where the water was
[1:09:29] and then there you take a christian
[1:09:31] that's supposed to be a christian
[1:09:32] and let the life of god go from him and
[1:09:35] the experience and the joy of serving
[1:09:37] christ
[1:09:37] and living in a church where such is
[1:09:40] going on he rottens twice as quick
[1:09:43] living right under it and you've seen
[1:09:46] people like that they come to church and
[1:09:47] then the devil comes in to create
[1:09:49] something
[1:09:49] and they cut their life long and they
[1:09:51] fall down and they just lay in the water
[1:09:53] the holy spirit maybe with the grudge
[1:09:55] and they rot twice as quick right in the
[1:09:57] church
[1:09:59] but brother ram gives us this thing he
[1:10:00] said now if we're trying to follow the
[1:10:02] message of the hour at least this part
[1:10:04] of the message we should
[1:10:05] live constantly in the life of christ so
[1:10:08] it's not a matter of being in the water
[1:10:10] it's a matter of the water the life
[1:10:12] being
[1:10:12] inside of me so i love you all and i'm
[1:10:15] just i'm speaking as one of you it's not
[1:10:17] to me it's not a preacher up there i'm
[1:10:19] one of you i
[1:10:21] have a job and i go to work and i work
[1:10:23] and i struggle
[1:10:24] through a pandemic and we had a business
[1:10:26] and it went from here to nothing and
[1:10:29] and and then my son started a business i
[1:10:31] said well i'll go work for my son i work
[1:10:32] for him and
[1:10:33] and and you know we're just trying to
[1:10:34] get through this thing
[1:10:36] but here's the thing is if you're a
[1:10:38] christian i was talking to somebody
[1:10:40] the other day i said you know here's the
[1:10:42] difference between me and the other guy
[1:10:44] maybe we're going through a pandemic i
[1:10:46] got a bologna sandwich he's got a
[1:10:47] baloney sandwich
[1:10:48] i got five gallons of gas he's got five
[1:10:50] gallons of gas
[1:10:51] i got three gallons of water he's got
[1:10:53] three gallons of water the difference is
[1:10:55] when my bologna
[1:10:56] sandwich runs out and my gas runs out
[1:10:58] and the water runs out
[1:10:59] i still have the creator with me all
[1:11:02] things were created by him and for him
[1:11:05] and jesus said i'll never leave you
[1:11:06] daniel and i'll never forsake you
[1:11:09] lo daniel i am with you always so when
[1:11:12] he runs out he has nothing
[1:11:14] when i run out i have the creator with
[1:11:17] me do you believe that
[1:11:18] that's what we have as christians we
[1:11:20] have christ with us
[1:11:22] david said though i walk through the
[1:11:23] valley of the shadow of death i will
[1:11:26] fear no evil
[1:11:27] for you're with me you can't have a
[1:11:30] shadow
[1:11:31] unless there's a light somewhere in the
[1:11:33] darkness
[1:11:34] can you say amen to that it doesn't
[1:11:36] matter what
[1:11:38] have you probably told that story when
[1:11:39] they come and told me my son had been in
[1:11:40] a car accident
[1:11:41] i don't remember where i tell stories
[1:11:42] but told me it was in a terrible
[1:11:44] accident and
[1:11:45] and and his head had a head injury and
[1:11:48] they just told me that i said
[1:11:49] okay but i got to go pray and i went in
[1:11:52] a little bathroom i said lord i don't
[1:11:54] understand
[1:11:55] i don't know where this is taken but i
[1:11:57] commit my life is in your hands
[1:11:59] like the song lord my life is in your
[1:12:01] hands every day we dedicate it
[1:12:03] i don't know what today holds but i know
[1:12:05] who holds today
[1:12:07] and my life is in his hands and long
[1:12:09] story short i went to one hospital just
[1:12:11] went right in the emergency room up and
[1:12:13] down
[1:12:13] where's my son where he's not here and
[1:12:15] so i just drove to louisville it's over
[1:12:17] there and the other one i said where's
[1:12:18] my son he said he's not here they're
[1:12:19] bringing him in on the helicopter so i
[1:12:21] stood and watched the helipad
[1:12:22] on the monitor right there waiting for
[1:12:24] my son not knowing what the injury was
[1:12:26] and then i waited
[1:12:27] and then directly they brought a gurney
[1:12:29] in and they had got the information
[1:12:31] mixed up it wasn't my son it was another
[1:12:33] brother's son and he brought him in but
[1:12:35] i just say that to say god knows
[1:12:37] everything
[1:12:38] amen how'd he say it psalms 91 i will
[1:12:40] not be afraid for the terror by night
[1:12:43] or an evil report or those things we
[1:12:45] have christ with us
[1:12:47] let me if you're a christian now if
[1:12:50] you're not a christian you have nothing
[1:12:52] you have no hope you could walk out of
[1:12:55] here and some 16 year old person texting
[1:12:57] across the center line
[1:12:58] and you go and meet your creator and
[1:13:01] answer to god and either go to heaven
[1:13:03] or you go to hell
[1:13:06] i don't want to hear fire and brimstone
[1:13:08] i'm sorry that's my job i'm not going to
[1:13:10] hear and tell you how to make donuts
[1:13:12] tell you how to sell stuff on etsy
[1:13:13] i'm here to tell you as a minister
[1:13:15] there's only heaven and hell
[1:13:17] we don't and so we're here to make our
[1:13:19] hearts right with god and so i say
[1:13:21] i'm i don't take chances i'm going to
[1:13:23] tell you a little bit i don't like
[1:13:25] chances i don't take chance i don't
[1:13:27] gamble i want to be sure
[1:13:29] about my soul i want to be sure i want
[1:13:31] to be sure remember the little boy with
[1:13:32] the kite going up there
[1:13:33] man said a string going up there he's in
[1:13:36] the clouds you can't see it he says
[1:13:38] what are you doing he said i'm flying a
[1:13:39] car he said i don't see no kite
[1:13:41] how do you know he said i know there's a
[1:13:42] guy who said how do you know he said i
[1:13:44] got this string and every once in a
[1:13:45] while
[1:13:46] i feel a tug on it and that's the way
[1:13:49] the believer should be not an experience
[1:13:51] we had 20 years ago or 30 years ago or
[1:13:53] five years ago
[1:13:54] there should be a tug in your heart
[1:13:56] there should be a
[1:13:57] pulsating of the holy spirit that echoes
[1:14:00] down in your heart
[1:14:01] amen and if you don't know what i'm
[1:14:02] talking about you can know what i'm
[1:14:04] talking about
[1:14:05] it's not just stories that brother
[1:14:06] branham told on a tape it's a living
[1:14:08] jesus christ
[1:14:10] well touch my brother dan that's in the
[1:14:12] hospital when i can't go there and i'm
[1:14:14] texting him dan
[1:14:15] i'll come and pray for him he said they
[1:14:16] won't let you come i said but i can get
[1:14:18] on my knees and i can pray for you and
[1:14:20] we prayed and god touched him and he's
[1:14:23] continuing touching
[1:14:24] and he's continuing to touch your
[1:14:26] situation in my situation
[1:14:28] it's all in his control we have a healer
[1:14:30] with this he said i'm the lord that
[1:14:31] heals all of your sicknesses
[1:14:33] and all of your diseases can you say
[1:14:37] amen to that
[1:14:38] the devil's desire is that you'd get a
[1:14:40] little sniffle that would go into an
[1:14:42] infection a fever would rise and your
[1:14:44] your life would be taken from you that's
[1:14:46] the devil the devil comes to seek kill
[1:14:48] and destroy and the only if you had
[1:14:51] coveted and you got over it there's only
[1:14:53] one person
[1:14:54] that caused you to get over and that's
[1:14:55] jesus christ
[1:14:57] can you say amen to that jesus said i am
[1:14:59] the way i am the truth and i
[1:15:02] am life brother man preaches a message
[1:15:04] called life is the healer is this okay
[1:15:06] life is a healer and they said well
[1:15:08] people say well medicine's a healer
[1:15:10] brother i'm saying well then cut cut my
[1:15:11] coat and put some medicine on it
[1:15:13] and it should heal it right if no it
[1:15:15] won't heal it oh well no it
[1:15:17] you got to be alive to then oh so then
[1:15:20] and then so uh you know brotherham said
[1:15:23] take a corpse and cut it and then pour
[1:15:25] the medicine on it said
[1:15:26] no it's gotta it said oh so life is the
[1:15:29] healer
[1:15:30] medicine is a poison that goes into your
[1:15:32] body that kills the bad germs
[1:15:34] so the good germs can regenerate and
[1:15:37] continue to grow and overtake the bad
[1:15:39] germs
[1:15:40] jesus christ is our healer it's
[1:15:42] everything is in jesus christ
[1:15:44] say well we got some good doctors out
[1:15:46] there but jesus christ gives them the
[1:15:48] heartbeat that keeps them alive
[1:15:50] and gives them the wisdom to know what
[1:15:52] to do
[1:15:54] isn't it good to know the lord isn't it
[1:15:57] good to place your life in his hands
[1:15:58] lord i place my life
[1:16:00] in your hands it's a song maybe we'll
[1:16:02] sing tonight
[1:16:03] i was thinking about that and and our
[1:16:05] thought this morning is
[1:16:06] is uh keeping revival in us and i i was
[1:16:10] reading this quote yesterday
[1:16:11] brother ram said i was called in on
[1:16:13] something the other day a group in
[1:16:14] arizona that's right here where we are
[1:16:16] and so there was something that happened
[1:16:17] way back in arizona uh this isn't
[1:16:19] questions and answers in 1964 it's at a
[1:16:22] ministerial meeting and
[1:16:23] they they were talking to brother and i
[1:16:24] said the only thing we got against you
[1:16:26] brother branham is one of the things is
[1:16:27] people that comes out here with you
[1:16:30] we can't get them to go to church
[1:16:31] anywhere
[1:16:33] now brother bam teaches us that spirits
[1:16:35] don't die
[1:16:36] they just change the person that dwells
[1:16:38] them in so here we are many years later
[1:16:40] and i would say that that was probably
[1:16:42] still the case because spirits don't die
[1:16:44] and even people around our message
[1:16:46] brother random said that there was
[1:16:47] something that followed the trait around
[1:16:49] this message that people wouldn't go to
[1:16:50] church
[1:16:51] and said they got children and
[1:16:52] everything and they won't go to church
[1:16:54] and well we told them they were welcome
[1:16:55] to come
[1:16:55] to our church and so brother abraham
[1:16:57] says well i know they put pressure on
[1:16:59] you and want you to join
[1:17:00] he said and he's talking to his people
[1:17:02] he said you don't
[1:17:03] you don't have to join but put them kids
[1:17:07] in sunday school
[1:17:08] somewhere this is brother ray i'm
[1:17:10] talking to his people put those kids in
[1:17:11] sunday school somewhere
[1:17:13] and he said you go to church don't sit
[1:17:15] at home go fishing and hunting and
[1:17:17] things like that on sunday
[1:17:19] and he said you say well i'm not a
[1:17:20] legalist so he beats to the punch
[1:17:23] to those people that are going to say
[1:17:24] well i'm not a legalist brother branham
[1:17:26] says well you better be
[1:17:27] in that manner for a while dishonoring
[1:17:30] the resurrection of christ
[1:17:33] that's good admonition isn't it that's a
[1:17:35] prophet diagnosing the situation
[1:17:37] around our message and telling us the
[1:17:39] solution to that
[1:17:41] i'm so thankful for that and i was
[1:17:43] thinking about that because
[1:17:44] many people left israel they left egypt
[1:17:47] if you have your bibles let's go back in
[1:17:48] the bibles to the book of joshua
[1:17:51] and i just want to read through these
[1:17:52] very quickly um
[1:17:54] through the book of joshua because there
[1:17:56] was many that left
[1:17:58] egypt and then they disbelieved the word
[1:17:59] of god and they roamed in the wilderness
[1:18:01] joshua chapter 5.
[1:18:03] if you're around me you're going to read
[1:18:04] your bible okay you're going to have
[1:18:06] your bible with us brother branham came
[1:18:08] to turn our hearts back
[1:18:09] to the bible not to this
[1:18:13] cloud of vapor i mean some people want
[1:18:16] to believe that brother ram just came on
[1:18:17] the earth and
[1:18:17] there was nothing before him and nothing
[1:18:19] after him it just no brother branham was
[1:18:21] one of the
[1:18:22] seven church age messengers now we
[1:18:24] believe and give respect to the
[1:18:25] to the church age messenger in our day
[1:18:27] but paul was a messenger and martin and
[1:18:29] ireneus and columbus and
[1:18:31] and all of those men were messengers so
[1:18:33] brother branham he said i'm
[1:18:34] on the platform that those pentecostal
[1:18:37] people
[1:18:38] built for me so we can't come along and
[1:18:40] rip the platform off and have him just
[1:18:42] standing in the air
[1:18:43] no we got to come back and know that
[1:18:45] what we believe is founded in the bible
[1:18:48] and so we come here to joshua the first
[1:18:49] chapter
[1:18:51] and it says and it came to pass i'm
[1:18:52] sorry joshua chapter 5 verse 1
[1:18:55] and when the kings of the amorites which
[1:18:56] were on the side of jordan went
[1:18:59] westward and all the kings of canaanites
[1:19:01] which were by the sea
[1:19:02] heard that that the lord had dried up
[1:19:04] the waters of the jordan from before the
[1:19:06] children of israel
[1:19:07] until they were passed over that their
[1:19:09] heart melted neither was there any
[1:19:10] spirit in them
[1:19:11] anymore because of the children of
[1:19:13] israel now stay with me here i know i'm
[1:19:15] reading a little bit
[1:19:16] but at that time the lord said unto
[1:19:17] joshua make these sharp knives and
[1:19:19] circumcise again the children of israel
[1:19:21] the second time
[1:19:22] so stay with me as we go through this
[1:19:24] story they were all in egypt for 400
[1:19:26] years
[1:19:26] god said by prophecy i'll bring them out
[1:19:28] with a mighty hand they spoil the
[1:19:29] egyptians they come out to cross the red
[1:19:31] sea
[1:19:31] and now they're with this prophet
[1:19:33] messenger in a wilderness and they're
[1:19:34] traveling
[1:19:35] just as we've left many times our
[1:19:37] denominations our churches wrote
[1:19:38] fulfilling revelations chapter 18 come
[1:19:41] out of her my people we're following a
[1:19:42] message
[1:19:43] but a lot of people have died in the
[1:19:45] wilderness in the last 40 years
[1:19:47] can you say amen to that and they're not
[1:19:49] in church today maybe the church was
[1:19:50] packed at one time but now it's not
[1:19:52] packed what happened to the people
[1:19:53] they died in the wilderness so now they
[1:19:56] come to a time where god said i want to
[1:19:58] do something else.
[1:19:59] and joshua comes on the scene and joshua
[1:20:01] means jehovah's savior brother ram said
[1:20:03] it's the holy spirit
[1:20:05] jesus christ that's bringing us so now
[1:20:06] they come to a time where god was
[1:20:08] wanting to move his people a little bit
[1:20:10] farther so he comes here
[1:20:11] and he said we need to circumcise them
[1:20:13] again the second time
[1:20:15] and joshua made them sharp knives and
[1:20:16] circumcised the children of israel at
[1:20:18] the hill of the foreskin
[1:20:19] and this is the same cause why joshua
[1:20:21] did circumcise listen to this
[1:20:23] all the people that came out of egypt
[1:20:25] that were males
[1:20:26] even all the men of war died in the
[1:20:28] wilderness by the way
[1:20:29] after they came out of egypt and all the
[1:20:32] people that came out were circumcised
[1:20:34] now circumcision is a type of the holy
[1:20:36] spirit to cut off circle
[1:20:38] surplus flesh i'm going to talk to you
[1:20:40] as adults if that's okay our world
[1:20:42] that the internet has taken away all
[1:20:43] innocence from the world and we think
[1:20:45] about bringing people up can you say
[1:20:46] amen to that
[1:20:47] so i'm glad that the prophet of god and
[1:20:49] the bible just brings the facts of life
[1:20:51] right before us and we talk about those
[1:20:52] things and it's written
[1:20:53] is there anything wrong with reading any
[1:20:54] verse in the bible okay
[1:20:56] so we're continuing now all the people
[1:20:58] that came out were circumcised but all
[1:21:00] the people that were born in the
[1:21:01] wilderness or on this journey
[1:21:04] by the way as they came forth out of
[1:21:06] egypt them they had not
[1:21:07] circumcised those people had maybe never
[1:21:10] had
[1:21:11] a separation from the world i would say
[1:21:14] this a lot of the people around our
[1:21:15] message have not
[1:21:16] never had a personal encounter with the
[1:21:19] supernatural
[1:21:20] i was talking to brother um brother
[1:21:22] aaron in the back and he was describing
[1:21:24] i don't know some people that have came
[1:21:25] in and they were in brother branham's
[1:21:26] meeting in 1961 and they
[1:21:28] he said that at the church they were
[1:21:29] kind of over on this side and brother
[1:21:30] branham was saying now this message is
[1:21:32] for them because these people
[1:21:33] wouldn't accept it and those people saw
[1:21:36] the supernatural the discernment maybe
[1:21:38] sister yarber or some of you other ones
[1:21:39] were there and
[1:21:40] saw the discernment and it triggered
[1:21:42] your heart and you followed the
[1:21:42] messenger didn't matter what they say
[1:21:44] you were there when the discernment and
[1:21:45] all those things
[1:21:46] happen and you're following a message
[1:21:48] because you saw a supernatural god
[1:21:50] and the vindication of it and it held
[1:21:52] your heart
[1:21:53] and now for many many years people have
[1:21:55] just joined the message
[1:21:57] they've just come among us they've just
[1:22:00] married in
[1:22:01] and they've never been circumcised from
[1:22:03] the things of the world brother henry
[1:22:04] you know what i'm talking about they've
[1:22:05] never
[1:22:06] separated or had an identification from
[1:22:08] the world
[1:22:09] had a real experience with god
[1:22:12] to know that this message was sent by
[1:22:14] god
[1:22:15] brother ram talks about that the baptist
[1:22:17] man comes to brother branham says
[1:22:19] brother branham he said all abraham
[1:22:21] could do is believe and brother ram said
[1:22:23] yes but god gave him the sign of
[1:22:24] circumcision
[1:22:26] he cut him away from the world and cut
[1:22:28] the world away from him and made him a
[1:22:29] separated people
[1:22:31] and now joshua's god is getting ready to
[1:22:33] do something and joshua says look we
[1:22:34] have to
[1:22:35] do this again verse number six for the
[1:22:38] children of israel walk 40 years in the
[1:22:39] wilderness to
[1:22:40] all the people that were men of war
[1:22:42] which came out of egypt were consumed
[1:22:44] because they obeyed not the voice
[1:22:46] of the lord what is the voice of the
[1:22:48] lord it's the word of god
[1:22:51] and you see people that are not serving
[1:22:53] the lord today
[1:22:54] because they would not obey the word of
[1:22:57] the lord
[1:22:58] this is really simple this is not rocket
[1:23:00] science this is obey the word of the
[1:23:02] lord and walk in him and keep revival in
[1:23:05] you keep life
[1:23:06] inside of you that takes some effort
[1:23:07] that takes some energy in this day
[1:23:09] we read over there in revelation chapter
[1:23:11] 3 where it was lukewarm neither hot
[1:23:14] neither cold it's just lukewarm i'm just
[1:23:17] around the message i'm just
[1:23:19] and jesus said i would that you were
[1:23:20] cold or i would i would you were hot
[1:23:23] hey i'm just kind of hanging out to kind
[1:23:25] of like a spectator
[1:23:27] you know i'm just going to vent a little
[1:23:30] bit right here is that okay
[1:23:31] we had to go they shut everything down
[1:23:33] we had to go to total streaming
[1:23:35] you know it is what it is so we were
[1:23:37] streaming there and so we got to talk
[1:23:39] and we realized people were becoming
[1:23:40] spectators and not participators
[1:23:43] and that's not what we want spectators
[1:23:45] we got enough spectators around here we
[1:23:47] need participators
[1:23:48] that's what happened around us people
[1:23:50] like man what are you crying for why are
[1:23:52] you
[1:23:52] these trials where are you going like
[1:23:53] man you're just sitting up in the
[1:23:54] bleachers as a spectator
[1:23:56] you got to get down into battle one time
[1:23:57] and run on the field and fight in the
[1:23:59] battle and get some sweat and some
[1:24:00] blood on you then you'll understand all
[1:24:02] about it and that's what we find with
[1:24:04] the streaming people just like oh
[1:24:06] that was pretty good i'll switch over to
[1:24:08] this that's pretty good
[1:24:10] um about a five
[1:24:16] sometimes we get church like that it's
[1:24:18] like ah
[1:24:19] pretty good i'll put some money for it's
[1:24:21] just like a show you know yeah go ahead
[1:24:22] and put some money in the box that's
[1:24:24] pretty good
[1:24:25] maybe a little extra this week and i'll
[1:24:27] come back next time see if you got
[1:24:28] something better what's on the show and
[1:24:30] and it just because and we don't become
[1:24:32] participators in it
[1:24:34] and so i asked the people i said now hey
[1:24:36] and they were streaming and i said all
[1:24:37] right let me ask you when we just said
[1:24:38] let's stand and read the bible did you
[1:24:40] stand up are you still sitting on the
[1:24:41] couch
[1:24:43] you're sitting on a you're a spectator
[1:24:45] you're not participating
[1:24:46] our goal in the streaming is not to
[1:24:48] spectate and people just spectate it's
[1:24:50] no it's to become
[1:24:51] take the church if we have we don't know
[1:24:52] tomorrow it might all change we all be
[1:24:54] back to that
[1:24:55] and then you're there but we should be
[1:24:56] participating i'm a part of this thing
[1:24:58] i'm
[1:24:59] praising the lord i'm worshiping
[1:25:00] virtually if i have to but i'm a part of
[1:25:02] a body of christ
[1:25:04] and if we have to go to that we have to
[1:25:06] go to that but the bible says david said
[1:25:08] i was glad when they said let us go
[1:25:10] into the house of the lord that's a
[1:25:13] whole other sermon isn't it
[1:25:15] we'll get to that but it's in the bible
[1:25:19] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:25:21] together
[1:25:22] that much more as you see the day of
[1:25:24] fortune paul said i write these things
[1:25:26] unto you that you might know how to
[1:25:27] behave yourself
[1:25:29] in the house of god so where did the
[1:25:32] institution of the church come from
[1:25:34] came from the bible
[1:25:38] it's a whole another sermon my brother
[1:25:39] preached a whole sermon called church
[1:25:40] order
[1:25:41] and he tells us what the church should
[1:25:43] look like as an example
[1:25:45] i hope that's okay so we go on to say
[1:25:49] here
[1:25:49] verse number six and unto the lord and
[1:25:52] unto whom the lord swear that he would
[1:25:53] not
[1:25:54] show them the land which the lord swear
[1:25:56] unto their fathers that he would give
[1:25:57] them the land that floweth with milk and
[1:25:59] honey
[1:26:00] and their children whom he had raised up
[1:26:01] in their stead them joshua circumcised
[1:26:04] for they were uncircumcised because they
[1:26:06] had not circumcised
[1:26:08] them by the way verse number nine and
[1:26:10] the lord said unto joshua this day have
[1:26:12] i rolled away the reproach of
[1:26:14] egypt from you what was egypt but type
[1:26:16] of egypt was the type of the world
[1:26:18] and so there was a circumcision that
[1:26:20] rolled away
[1:26:21] the the how do you say the reproach of
[1:26:24] the world and that's what we need we
[1:26:25] need the reproach of the world
[1:26:26] separated from god's people we need to
[1:26:29] get out of the world and stop
[1:26:30] dabbling in the things of the world and
[1:26:32] that's what happened to the church we've
[1:26:33] lowered the standard down so far
[1:26:35] and the world has become religious and
[1:26:36] we all just sit together and we're just
[1:26:38] one
[1:26:38] and that's not the way it should be
[1:26:40] because the bible says in psalms 1 that
[1:26:42] the unrighteous will not stand
[1:26:44] in the congregation of the righteous and
[1:26:46] really it falls back on a preacher's job
[1:26:48] to preach hell
[1:26:49] hot and heaven high and separate there
[1:26:51] is a difference between a sinner and a
[1:26:53] saint
[1:26:54] can you say amen to that just because
[1:26:56] you sing these modern praise songs
[1:26:57] doesn't mean you're a christian
[1:26:59] you're a christian because you bear the
[1:27:01] life of the word of god out that's hard
[1:27:04] preaching isn't it
[1:27:05] but it's the word of god and that's what
[1:27:08] i as a minister
[1:27:09] um just you know he doesn't have the
[1:27:13] right to
[1:27:13] to preach his own opinion he has to
[1:27:15] preach the word of god
[1:27:17] and that's what we're trying to do we're
[1:27:18] trying to keep life in us we're trying
[1:27:19] to keep life in the church
[1:27:21] so we're not just a dead formal church i
[1:27:23] was reading over in the book of
[1:27:25] joel uh you know sometimes people just
[1:27:28] i was tempted to put in my ipad i
[1:27:29] thought no it'd be good thing if we read
[1:27:31] it in our bibles i'm big about the bible
[1:27:34] joel chapter 2 it has in the old
[1:27:36] testament
[1:27:37] joel amos obadiah jonah micah mayhem
[1:27:47] book of joel chapter 2 verse 12.
[1:27:52] the bible says therefore also now
[1:27:56] saith the lord turn ye even to me with
[1:27:58] all your heart
[1:28:00] that's what we're talking about revival
[1:28:01] in me with all of your heart and with
[1:28:04] fasting and with weeping and with
[1:28:06] mourning and wrench your heart
[1:28:09] and not your garment so there was a time
[1:28:13] when samuel
[1:28:14] and saul had done wrong and the bible
[1:28:15] says samuel rempt rent his garment he
[1:28:17] ripped and just like
[1:28:18] oh god and now joel is saying look don't
[1:28:21] rip your coat
[1:28:23] rinse your heart i think it's the thing
[1:28:27] this morning it's time
[1:28:28] to rend our heart from anything of the
[1:28:30] world
[1:28:31] the bible says if you love the world of
[1:28:32] the things of the world the love of
[1:28:33] god's not in you
[1:28:34] and say lord just rend anything of the
[1:28:36] world it's not like you take it away
[1:28:38] from me lord
[1:28:39] they come to jesus what is the greatest
[1:28:41] commandment he said thou shalt love the
[1:28:42] lord with all of your hearts
[1:28:44] with all of your soul with all of your
[1:28:46] mind and with all of your strength
[1:28:48] i got a sermon i want to talk about that
[1:28:50] tonight about brokenness jesus said this
[1:28:53] is my
[1:28:54] this bread is my body that was broken
[1:28:57] for
[1:28:57] you broken for you and i want to talk
[1:29:01] about
[1:29:02] a lot of the talented people in the
[1:29:03] world and how that they're not broken
[1:29:05] and the only thing they serve is
[1:29:06] themself
[1:29:08] and they have no service to the uh we'll
[1:29:11] talk about that tonight
[1:29:12] i was laying in bed this morning i wake
[1:29:14] up about five o'clock and i'm sitting
[1:29:16] there all right lord i
[1:29:17] you know now we got the pretty sermons
[1:29:19] and the holy spirit's taking me what
[1:29:20] about the seven visions that brother
[1:29:22] branham went and he saw
[1:29:24] the america all just nothing but craters
[1:29:27] where's your 401k
[1:29:28] and all your education and all your
[1:29:30] degrees and all that when it's nothing
[1:29:31] but craters
[1:29:33] those are prophecies that are going to
[1:29:34] come to pass the google car that drives
[1:29:37] you know the prophet 1933 has the vision
[1:29:39] he sees it
[1:29:41] the woman in purple and we see that
[1:29:43] being fulfilled and we see
[1:29:44] now lord is all of this kind and it's
[1:29:46] coming to pass
[1:29:47] he said when you see all these things
[1:29:48] happen what do you say go into
[1:29:50] depression get you some pills just uh
[1:29:52] no he said lift up your head for your
[1:29:54] redemption is coming
[1:29:56] your redemption draweth nigh it's time
[1:29:58] to leave
[1:30:00] how was it brother arnie were standing
[1:30:01] around the fire last night he said you
[1:30:02] know
[1:30:03] the bible says that knowledge shall
[1:30:04] increase and now you've got your iphone
[1:30:06] there's more computing power on an
[1:30:08] iphone than there is
[1:30:09] on the original capsule that went to the
[1:30:11] moon and now kids at
[1:30:13] 12 years old think i gotta have it i
[1:30:15] gotta have really you gotta have all
[1:30:16] that
[1:30:18] if we would just see it as the scripture
[1:30:21] being fulfilled and the last days
[1:30:23] knowledge shall increase
[1:30:25] lord help us rend your heart not your
[1:30:27] garments and turn unto the lord your god
[1:30:31] for he is gracious oh i love this i
[1:30:33] don't like to preach about judgment but
[1:30:35] as a minister i have to preach about
[1:30:37] judgment
[1:30:37] but i like to preach more about mercy
[1:30:40] you know we're coming to a white throne
[1:30:41] judgment and the bible says the saints
[1:30:42] will judge the earth
[1:30:44] but we're not there right now jesus said
[1:30:47] you go and be my witnesses of mercy and
[1:30:49] forgiveness and
[1:30:51] drawing power and the blood of jesus
[1:30:52] christ cleanses that's the time that
[1:30:54] we're living
[1:30:55] that could change overnight the bible
[1:30:57] says there coming a time when let him
[1:30:59] that is filthy be filthy still
[1:31:00] let him that is holy be holy still and i
[1:31:02] don't know when that's going to be
[1:31:04] it might be by noon today it might be by
[1:31:06] four o'clock but i'm going to preach
[1:31:08] while i believe there's mercy that there
[1:31:09] is mercy
[1:31:10] because i feel something drawing in our
[1:31:12] hearts can you say amen to that
[1:31:14] jesus said no man can come except the
[1:31:16] father draws him
[1:31:17] and we're all over the place tonight
[1:31:19] this morning but i feel the holy spirit
[1:31:20] just taking us so
[1:31:22] i was dealing with a young person he
[1:31:23] said i'm just going to go do my thing
[1:31:25] and
[1:31:25] you know when i get i'll come back to
[1:31:27] the lord i said hey you know what
[1:31:29] you know what what you have your idea
[1:31:31] about jesus christ is not right you
[1:31:33] think
[1:31:33] christ is like this light switch i don't
[1:31:35] even know what this goes to
[1:31:38] i said you think you turn it on and you
[1:31:39] think you turn it on
[1:31:41] you need to get a grip on life because
[1:31:43] the bible says no man can
[1:31:45] come except the father draws him you
[1:31:48] can't even have a desire
[1:31:50] unless god gives you that desire oh
[1:31:53] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:55] if you have a desire this morning for
[1:31:56] god you ought to just be so thankful
[1:31:59] say lord i thank you for that desire how
[1:32:01] many people are still in bed this
[1:32:03] morning but something
[1:32:04] came in your life said get up and go to
[1:32:06] the house of god
[1:32:08] i want to talk to you i want to speak to
[1:32:10] you
[1:32:12] i can tell you that's not the devil that
[1:32:14] is jesus christ
[1:32:16] amen that wants to bring you close to
[1:32:18] him that wants to forgive you of all of
[1:32:20] our sins
[1:32:21] that wants to heal all of our sicknesses
[1:32:24] he wants to bind up the brokenhearted
[1:32:26] blessed be the name of the lord i love
[1:32:28] to preach about him
[1:32:30] he's all that we have in this world amen
[1:32:33] rend your heart
[1:32:34] he said he is gracious he's slow to
[1:32:37] anger
[1:32:37] and of kindness and repenteth him of
[1:32:39] evil
[1:32:40] blessed be the name of the lord so i was
[1:32:42] thinking about that and i was thinking
[1:32:44] about the
[1:32:45] brotherhood talks about the welch
[1:32:46] revival there were some men that went
[1:32:48] over to wales and they were trying to
[1:32:49] find the welch revival and they were
[1:32:51] there was a little policeman there
[1:32:53] swinging his baton
[1:32:55] and they said ah he's singing a song
[1:32:57] let's go talking like hey
[1:32:58] do you know where the welch revival is
[1:32:59] he said yeah the wealth revival is
[1:33:01] in me i said no no where's the building
[1:33:04] where they're having the welterweight he
[1:33:05] said no you don't understand the welch
[1:33:07] revival is in me
[1:33:08] it's inside of me and that's the christ
[1:33:10] should be in you
[1:33:12] how paul say christ in you the hope of
[1:33:14] glory
[1:33:15] he's my hope he's my life amen sister as
[1:33:18] we grow older i want to feel that tug on
[1:33:20] the other end paul said
[1:33:22] if the same spirit that raised christ
[1:33:23] from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken
[1:33:25] your mortal body
[1:33:26] i want to feel the quickening power of
[1:33:28] the holy ghost i want to hear an amen
[1:33:30] from down on the inside
[1:33:31] when the word of god is quick and i want
[1:33:33] to hear the when it's quoted the holy
[1:33:35] spirit inside of
[1:33:36] you will say hey you say amen
[1:33:40] that's my word i'm stuck down inside i
[1:33:42] have no voice but your voice say amen
[1:33:45] and then brother graham said god will
[1:33:47] make your body obey your confession
[1:33:51] amen the power how's the scripture say
[1:33:53] the power that worketh in you
[1:33:55] there's a power that's working in a son
[1:33:57] and daughter of god do you believe it
[1:34:00] or do you did you just stumble into this
[1:34:02] thing
[1:34:04] just dad mom had me i'm here
[1:34:07] yeah i can't wait till i'm 18. that's
[1:34:10] what paul says you need to go work out
[1:34:12] there and say you know there was a lot
[1:34:13] of nicer better people in that bar than
[1:34:15] me that day but god
[1:34:16] found me and he chose me and he picked
[1:34:19] me up from the gutter and he brought me
[1:34:20] to where i am
[1:34:21] and maybe all i have is a desire for god
[1:34:23] you might your life might be broken in
[1:34:25] the devil you say brother daniel
[1:34:26] i don't know they didn't preach it hard
[1:34:28] enough and i went out and got entangled
[1:34:29] amen
[1:34:30] we can't change yesterday we just need
[1:34:33] to you know sometimes i like simplicity
[1:34:35] i can't change yesterday good bad and
[1:34:38] different it is what it is
[1:34:40] but i'm not going to let my yesterday
[1:34:41] determine who i am today
[1:34:44] let me say that again i'm not going to
[1:34:45] let my yesterday determine who i
[1:34:48] am today i made mistakes yesterday but
[1:34:51] i'm not the man that i was yesterday i'm
[1:34:53] a different man
[1:34:55] as the one man said a lady said you know
[1:34:58] what i'm not what i
[1:34:59] i want to be and i'm certainly not what
[1:35:01] i ought to be
[1:35:03] but i thank god i'm not what i used to
[1:35:05] be
[1:35:07] can you say amen to that i'm not what i
[1:35:09] used to be god is doing something in my
[1:35:11] life oh that's what i love to see
[1:35:12] god is doing something god is moving
[1:35:15] among us i want to see
[1:35:16] where will we be without him god i want
[1:35:17] to see you move i want to see you the
[1:35:19] doctor say look we're going to do
[1:35:20] emergency surgery but what did god say
[1:35:22] god said no not yet let's just wait a
[1:35:24] little bit and saints begin to pray
[1:35:26] amen and these signs shall follow them
[1:35:28] that believe and then the report comes
[1:35:29] like no it's changed it's not going that
[1:35:31] way it's going this way god
[1:35:32] is working prayer changes things
[1:35:35] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:35:37] pray
[1:35:37] believe it believe it
[1:35:40] brother daniel i don't know if i believe
[1:35:41] or not faith cometh by
[1:35:44] hearing and you're in church and all of
[1:35:46] a sudden you hear the word of god
[1:35:48] and it begins to lift you up it begins
[1:35:49] to change your mind from looking from
[1:35:51] doubt and unbelief
[1:35:52] to faith then you start looking up to
[1:35:54] jesus christ
[1:35:55] faith cometh by hearing blessed be the
[1:35:57] name of the lord we've got many things
[1:35:59] written here but i don't
[1:36:00] you know i don't know how to preach but
[1:36:03] he knows how to preach
[1:36:05] he's the preacher the holy spirit is the
[1:36:08] preacher
[1:36:09] but i can tell you we need an
[1:36:10] old-fashioned revival a sin
[1:36:12] killing revival amen and i believe we
[1:36:15] want it i believe people really want to
[1:36:16] see god move in their life they want to
[1:36:18] see them in their families they want to
[1:36:20] see god heal the sick they want to see
[1:36:21] god
[1:36:22] touch people and break a heart to so
[1:36:24] hard and watch it break and
[1:36:26] watch the spirit of god move i believe i
[1:36:28] want that
[1:36:29] but the only way we're going to get is
[1:36:30] we got to get away from the world
[1:36:33] the things of the world i was one of my
[1:36:36] friend called me the other day yesterday
[1:36:39] he
[1:36:39] flew into phoenix and he's there and he
[1:36:42] said man we just played 18 rounds of
[1:36:43] golf and man it's just
[1:36:45] there and man why doesn't people just
[1:36:46] forsake everything and just move out
[1:36:48] here
[1:36:48] he's having some challenges and and that
[1:36:51] and he's got two three little girls to
[1:36:52] raise and
[1:36:53] i said look brother i said look don't
[1:36:55] lay down your cross
[1:36:56] just because they got a nice golf course
[1:36:58] up there
[1:36:59] you get away and you think you're in
[1:37:01] heaven brother man said that about
[1:37:02] florida he said i went to florida he
[1:37:03] said they take more care
[1:37:04] better care of their lawn then i do my
[1:37:06] hair and he said what they're trying to
[1:37:08] do is create a millennium listen to me
[1:37:10] trying to create a millennium without
[1:37:12] the return of jesus christ
[1:37:15] so my brother i encourage him look don't
[1:37:17] lay your cross down
[1:37:18] you have children to raise you have a
[1:37:20] family amen you have these things don't
[1:37:22] lay your cross down because the devil
[1:37:23] creates lady osea are you with me today
[1:37:26] creates a an eden satan's eden
[1:37:29] and you pretty soon want to live in
[1:37:31] satan's eden
[1:37:33] oh my let his help have vision the bible
[1:37:34] says young men shall see
[1:37:36] visions listen to me young men you're
[1:37:39] here
[1:37:40] some of you creed sitting here he's
[1:37:41] getting ready and then brother matthew
[1:37:43] and these young men sitting here i
[1:37:44] believe
[1:37:45] we should be young jesus said except you
[1:37:46] become like a little children so no
[1:37:47] matter oh
[1:37:48] how this body gets there's a spirit
[1:37:50] inside of us amen the bible says young
[1:37:52] men will have a vision
[1:37:54] the vision i want to have the vision the
[1:37:56] prophet had when he saw america all
[1:37:58] laying in craters
[1:38:00] i don't want my millennium to be in
[1:38:02] craters
[1:38:03] amen jesus said lay not up for
[1:38:05] yourselves on earth where moth and rest
[1:38:07] doth corrupt but lay up here for
[1:38:08] yourselves and treasures
[1:38:10] where moth and rust doth not corrupt and
[1:38:12] where thieves do not break through and
[1:38:14] steal
[1:38:14] there's another supernatural land
[1:38:18] it's called the kingdom of god there's a
[1:38:21] sermon about that thick that i i don't
[1:38:22] think i don't know if i brought it with
[1:38:24] me and i'd love to preach that one right
[1:38:25] the kingdom of god jesus said if my
[1:38:27] kingdom were over this world i would
[1:38:28] fight but my kingdom he said
[1:38:30] the kingdom of god is within you
[1:38:33] it's inside of you it's a kingdom i love
[1:38:35] it back in the bible how's the way when
[1:38:37] the they're talking about the angels
[1:38:39] coming to mary and said of his kingdom
[1:38:40] there shall be no end
[1:38:43] there's not going to be an end to this
[1:38:44] kingdom so i say young man let's get a
[1:38:46] real vision
[1:38:46] not 50 60 and a million dollars in the
[1:38:49] bank in a nice retirement
[1:38:50] that's all going to be ashes no let's
[1:38:53] think about 100 years from now 200 years
[1:38:55] from now on
[1:38:56] streets of gold and amen we're in a new
[1:38:58] body travel with the speed of thought
[1:39:00] walk through a wall like jesus remember
[1:39:02] he
[1:39:02] he come he appeared to his disciples he
[1:39:04] ate some bread and fish and then he
[1:39:05] walked through the wall
[1:39:07] is that what the bible says he ate the
[1:39:09] fish and he went and you know what and
[1:39:10] when he went through the wall the fish
[1:39:12] didn't hit the wall and slide down
[1:39:15] somehow when he ate it the fish became
[1:39:17] supernatural and went through the wall
[1:39:18] too
[1:39:19] oh brothers and sisters that's not
[1:39:22] science fiction the bible says
[1:39:24] we doth not we do not know yet what we
[1:39:27] shall be but we know when he shall
[1:39:29] appear we shall be like him
[1:39:31] we're going to be like and we're going
[1:39:32] to have a body that's changing like his
[1:39:34] glorious body i believe it
[1:39:36] my bible says it i tell you when i
[1:39:38] believe the bible things change in my
[1:39:40] life
[1:39:41] oh blessed be the name of the lord isn't
[1:39:44] he good
[1:39:47] praise the lord page one
[1:39:51] you all just keep pulling in so many
[1:39:52] different directions
[1:39:54] i don't know why the lord put this on my
[1:39:56] heart but i just was thinking about this
[1:39:59] and they asked brother branham this
[1:40:00] question just about sunday i'm watching
[1:40:02] the clock back there what time do you
[1:40:03] all close
[1:40:07] i'm not one of those revelation 10
[1:40:08] preachers that believes in time shall be
[1:40:10] no more
[1:40:14] but i do believe that this is the most
[1:40:18] important thing in our lives is our walk
[1:40:20] with christ
[1:40:22] because the doubt the bible says the
[1:40:23] devil come to steal
[1:40:25] kill and destroy he wants to destroy
[1:40:27] every one of your homes
[1:40:29] he wants to destroy your faith in jesus
[1:40:31] christ
[1:40:32] and how brother ramsey your attitude
[1:40:34] towards the word of god will determine
[1:40:35] your eternal
[1:40:36] destiny and your attitude towards the
[1:40:38] word of god will determine where you are
[1:40:40] a year from now
[1:40:46] your attitude towards the word of god
[1:40:48] will determine where you
[1:40:50] are a year from now like i don't care
[1:40:52] about that i'm going to
[1:40:54] go do my thing and then the lord comes
[1:40:56] and you find yourself in hell
[1:40:58] remember the rich man he just wanted to
[1:41:00] drop a wire
[1:41:01] amen this is how we do this in sunday
[1:41:03] school
[1:41:05] remember he went to hell he only wanted
[1:41:07] one thing
[1:41:08] i want a drop of water that's all i want
[1:41:12] to cool my tongue from these flames
[1:41:16] it's been almost a year and a half since
[1:41:18] i've been here so if i tell a story and
[1:41:19] i tell it again you forgive me
[1:41:22] but that's reality and if you know me
[1:41:25] i don't like i am a salesperson and i
[1:41:28] don't like salespeople
[1:41:31] because i don't like the pressure like
[1:41:33] you just tell me what
[1:41:34] is the truth and i'll make a decision
[1:41:36] based on the truth
[1:41:38] and so when i come up here brother bran
[1:41:40] tells us that about scaring people and
[1:41:41] emotions
[1:41:42] he said don't he tells me as a minister
[1:41:44] don't do that just preach the truth and
[1:41:46] you'll know the truth
[1:41:48] and the truth will make you free bible
[1:41:50] says as many as believed him to them
[1:41:52] gave he
[1:41:53] power to be a sons of god so i'm not
[1:41:54] here to scare you i'm here to tell you a
[1:41:56] truth
[1:41:56] if you want to see you know think
[1:41:58] nearsighted and make a million dollars
[1:42:00] be a great name and have a plaque and
[1:42:01] all that stuff and just live and die and
[1:42:03] go to a devil's hell you do it
[1:42:05] but if you want to realize that there's
[1:42:06] something that told you to come to the
[1:42:07] house of the lord and god is
[1:42:09] pulling at your heart and saying look
[1:42:11] why don't you repent of your sins and if
[1:42:12] you've never been baptized
[1:42:14] i'm not here to encourage you here i'm
[1:42:16] here to provoke you
[1:42:18] because the bible says provoke one
[1:42:19] another unto love and good works
[1:42:21] because the bible says in mark 16 he
[1:42:23] that believeth
[1:42:24] and is baptized shall be saved and i
[1:42:27] want to see every one of you save that's
[1:42:29] my desire
[1:42:30] to see every one of you saved and if
[1:42:32] you're not baptized i want you to get
[1:42:33] baptized
[1:42:35] is that fair oh brother daniel that's
[1:42:37] just selfish well i don't know
[1:42:39] i just want you to be saved i want you
[1:42:41] to be with me i love you
[1:42:43] you know as a shepherd that's and i
[1:42:46] quoted it last night
[1:42:48] we're in the back room praying jesus
[1:42:50] said greater love hath no man that a man
[1:42:52] laid down his life for his friends
[1:42:55] how do you know i am genuine because i
[1:42:58] love you
[1:43:01] how did jesus tell peter he said if you
[1:43:03] love me
[1:43:04] feed my sheep
[1:43:08] so that's what genuine life for god so
[1:43:09] loved that he gave
[1:43:12] i only have so many heartbeats i'm 52
[1:43:14] years old the end is in sight
[1:43:18] and i'm not on a beach today i'm
[1:43:20] standing here giving my heartbeats for
[1:43:22] you because i love you
[1:43:24] and i love your children and i was
[1:43:27] thinking about that
[1:43:28] i don't know how to get through these
[1:43:29] notes let's just skip them
[1:43:32] i was thinking about that because some
[1:43:34] people don't know what a shepherd is
[1:43:37] and they think and it kind of like a a
[1:43:40] pastor is like a shepherd he's uh
[1:43:42] he's you know so some people change and
[1:43:44] they've in this day and age they've made
[1:43:46] it a good organizer
[1:43:47] a socialite uh a um
[1:43:51] a talented person maybe even a good
[1:43:52] speaker that makes a but that's
[1:43:54] a lot it can be that but that's not
[1:43:56] necessarily the case
[1:43:58] a shepherd is one that keeps sheep on
[1:44:01] the path
[1:44:03] to a destination is that simple
[1:44:06] shepherd is someone that keeps sheep on
[1:44:09] a path
[1:44:10] to reach their destination this is
[1:44:13] really simple but
[1:44:14] revelations chapter four john said after
[1:44:17] the church ages the seventh church age
[1:44:18] we live in revelation chapter
[1:44:20] three we read it right there but the
[1:44:21] next verse is i heard a voice as a
[1:44:23] trumpet from heaven and i saw a
[1:44:25] door open saying come up higher
[1:44:29] which was the rapture program says it
[1:44:31] was the rapture so
[1:44:32] if this is the door and our goal we're
[1:44:35] in revelation 3
[1:44:36] to make it to revelation 4 which is come
[1:44:38] up hither there's a rapture
[1:44:40] to go through that and that's our goal
[1:44:43] is to get sheep to go in the rapture
[1:44:45] then that is everything that a shepherd
[1:44:47] does is to keep people on the path
[1:44:49] how david say thy rod and they staff
[1:44:52] they comfort me they nudge me in the
[1:44:53] right way what is the staff it's the
[1:44:55] word of god
[1:44:58] we were kidding about that the other day
[1:45:00] because
[1:45:01] david said thy rod which is the word of
[1:45:04] god and thy staff and we did that like
[1:45:06] this
[1:45:06] the ministry staff and the rod of the
[1:45:08] word of god and the staff
[1:45:10] all the people around you their job is
[1:45:12] to help you keep you
[1:45:13] on the path and as a minister we have a
[1:45:16] goal to
[1:45:17] reach a rapture can you say amen to that
[1:45:20] i was talking to the brothers yesterday
[1:45:22] now if we change the goal post
[1:45:24] and we change that and say our goal is
[1:45:26] not to make the rapture
[1:45:28] it's just to build a big church let's
[1:45:30] all be friends everybody love everybody
[1:45:32] and just have and just fill and we'll
[1:45:34] play basketball and
[1:45:35] oh man we'll just dude but wait wait
[1:45:38] wait
[1:45:40] we've missed the goal the goal is to go
[1:45:41] in a rapture to get our hearts ready for
[1:45:45] jesus christ
[1:45:46] doesn't matter if a person's ball-headed
[1:45:48] and can't speak and
[1:45:50] doesn't know their abcs if he can be a
[1:45:53] shepherd that tries to get sheep to stay
[1:45:54] on the path
[1:45:55] and reach the goal and go into the
[1:45:57] rapture i say brother daniel that's
[1:45:59] really simple it is simple but sometimes
[1:46:01] simple helps us
[1:46:03] sometimes we make life so complicated
[1:46:06] and so we see kind of where we are
[1:46:10] and we see that a shepherd
[1:46:13] when you're all in the valley it's all
[1:46:14] green who needs shepherd right
[1:46:16] but now when you start navigating on the
[1:46:18] side of a cliff
[1:46:19] and then you hear the coyotes roaring
[1:46:21] over here and roaring over here
[1:46:23] then you say where is the shepherd to
[1:46:25] lead me through this treacherous time
[1:46:27] that we live in
[1:46:31] and waterfalls and lions and all those
[1:46:33] things and then
[1:46:34] but we've got to stay on the path
[1:46:35] because if we follow the path we're sure
[1:46:37] to meet the goal right
[1:46:39] we follow the word of god we're sure to
[1:46:40] meet the goal but there's so many things
[1:46:41] that want to pull us off the path to
[1:46:43] glory
[1:46:45] we had to go to a seminar the other day
[1:46:47] for roofing we were in minnesota and
[1:46:48] they were talking about google
[1:46:50] it's all right to talk about a couple of
[1:46:52] the wolves and the lions and the
[1:46:53] waterfalls and the cliffs that are right
[1:46:55] around us
[1:46:56] and says the number one site that people
[1:46:58] visit is google the second site that
[1:47:00] most visited in the world is youtube
[1:47:03] everybody used to google how do i fix
[1:47:04] this and now they don't want to read
[1:47:06] about it they want somebody to show them
[1:47:07] and they're showing how youtube will
[1:47:08] come to
[1:47:09] become the number one number one
[1:47:12] site visited in the world and you don't
[1:47:14] think that's a cliff
[1:47:16] you look at something innocently and
[1:47:18] then all the other suggested stuff and
[1:47:20] then you're like
[1:47:20] how did i end up here you don't have to
[1:47:23] say man just look at me all right
[1:47:27] how did i fall all the way down here
[1:47:30] and then god brings a man from indiana
[1:47:32] that screams at you and says shake
[1:47:34] yourself what are you doing
[1:47:36] and the prophet screamed against tv i
[1:47:38] don't have a tv but now he talks start
[1:47:40] talking about hollywood
[1:47:42] and all the things of hollywood and now
[1:47:43] the glamour and all this and
[1:47:45] and what is the three things that
[1:47:46] usually get a man money women and
[1:47:47] popularity
[1:47:49] what is all the social media about how
[1:47:51] many likes is that popularity
[1:47:54] and people get people that dislike them
[1:47:55] i don't like it and then they go commit
[1:47:57] suicide
[1:47:58] what about those lions that are there
[1:48:00] and the roaring and the
[1:48:01] cliffs that are all around us
[1:48:04] powerful powerful things kingdoms
[1:48:08] kingdoms we have a president of the
[1:48:10] united states and all of a sudden
[1:48:11] instagram and google and facebook says
[1:48:13] hey you can't be on our platform and
[1:48:15] they shut the mouth of the president
[1:48:16] showing that
[1:48:17] they are more powerful kingdoms than
[1:48:19] even the president of the united states
[1:48:22] and some of us get captive by these
[1:48:24] things
[1:48:25] and and and and we and we're out here
[1:48:28] i think i said that probably last time i
[1:48:30] found facebook in the bible
[1:48:31] james 4 4 he that is a friend of the
[1:48:33] world is an enemy of god
[1:48:36] so when you see something that's wrong
[1:48:39] and you know you shouldn't do it but you
[1:48:40] go ahead and click
[1:48:41] like on that you have just become an
[1:48:43] enemy of god
[1:48:45] you said i like that i'm a friend of
[1:48:47] that
[1:48:48] may god shake ourselves
[1:48:52] i don't know why we're going down this
[1:48:53] road maybe just the holy spirit is the
[1:48:55] great shepherd right he's the shepherd
[1:48:57] trying to keep us all in the sheep it's
[1:48:59] not a man it's the shepherd trying to
[1:49:01] keep us on the ship
[1:49:02] on the straight and narrow road and get
[1:49:05] away from the world and the things of
[1:49:07] the world
[1:49:07] brother daniel did you say we couldn't
[1:49:09] have faith i didn't say that i said but
[1:49:11] there's a screaming coyote in a lion
[1:49:12] that's trying to destroy your family and
[1:49:14] trying to destroy your soul
[1:49:16] the bible says we are not ignorant of
[1:49:17] his devices i got another sermon about
[1:49:19] that thick on the devices of the devil
[1:49:21] so you come back to church all right
[1:49:27] i'll say it like this um christ is a
[1:49:29] mystery of god right at the beginning
[1:49:31] brother branham said if god's in you god
[1:49:33] goes to church
[1:49:35] remember that he said it and it's
[1:49:36] bitterness he said and you get that in
[1:49:38] your heart you don't have the desire to
[1:49:39] go to church he said your place is at
[1:49:41] the altar go back and listen to christ
[1:49:42] the mystery of god
[1:49:43] so where does it put all this roaming in
[1:49:45] the wilderness people that haven't been
[1:49:47] circumcised from the world and they love
[1:49:48] the world
[1:49:49] and the things of the world more than
[1:49:50] the love of god
[1:49:53] wow lord help us
[1:49:56] the devil has an agenda it's to get the
[1:49:58] people off the road
[1:50:01] my son william he he does business and
[1:50:04] different things and he had a facebook
[1:50:05] thing he said dad all i did was
[1:50:07] was was um quote a scripture and post
[1:50:11] the scripture on there and facebook
[1:50:12] banned me from that area of facebook
[1:50:14] because i
[1:50:15] just posted a scripture you don't think
[1:50:17] they got a database with every bible
[1:50:19] verse in there and when you put a bible
[1:50:20] verse up there
[1:50:21] why because the bible says the word of
[1:50:23] god is quick and it's
[1:50:24] powerful powerful
[1:50:28] blessed be the name of the lord actually
[1:50:30] let me just say this the very first time
[1:50:31] god spoke out of the mountain the people
[1:50:33] said
[1:50:34] well we can't handle the voice of god
[1:50:37] let
[1:50:38] dumb it down a little bit and go through
[1:50:40] moses and bring it to us in a human way
[1:50:42] because the word of god
[1:50:43] is so powerful oh may god help us say
[1:50:46] lord speak to me and he'll speak
[1:50:48] he's speaking today that's what
[1:50:50] revelation chapter or hebrews chapter 4
[1:50:52] says the word of god is quick and
[1:50:53] powerful and is a discerner
[1:50:55] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:50:57] heart the word of god is a law goes he's
[1:51:00] going down and some of you are just
[1:51:01] looking at me with the eye
[1:51:02] your eyes because it's not brother
[1:51:03] daniel speaking to you it's the holy
[1:51:05] spirit speaking to you
[1:51:06] he is still discerning where we live i
[1:51:08] maybe didn't even get in your closet
[1:51:10] didn't get out there under that thing
[1:51:11] that you buried out in your garage but
[1:51:12] the holy spirit got there
[1:51:14] we don't need a list of do's and don'ts
[1:51:16] we just need the holy ghost
[1:51:18] we just need the holy ghost and i want
[1:51:20] it i say lord help me lord
[1:51:22] i want to go in the rapture that's my
[1:51:24] desire is to go on a rapture and
[1:51:26] anything that's around me that's not
[1:51:27] like christ i want to get it away from
[1:51:29] me
[1:51:30] blessed be the name of the lord i just
[1:51:34] want to read this quote brother and we
[1:51:35] went through this the other day in
[1:51:36] church but iran was talking about
[1:51:39] he said you see in a church a pastor
[1:51:42] he's going through the five offices and
[1:51:44] he said the pastor that
[1:51:45] pastor is a special person he's built to
[1:51:47] where he can put up with the fusses of
[1:51:48] the people
[1:51:49] he's a burden bearer he's the ox of the
[1:51:52] team he's a man that can sit down with
[1:51:54] uh
[1:51:54] somebody's got something against
[1:51:55] somebody else and sit down with them two
[1:51:57] families
[1:51:58] and take neither side and reason it out
[1:52:01] and bring it right back into sweetness
[1:52:02] he's a pastor he knows
[1:52:04] how to do things he knows how to do
[1:52:08] things and i'll just leave that at that
[1:52:10] let's talk about another thing about a
[1:52:11] shepherd sometimes a shepherd as sheep
[1:52:13] gets sick
[1:52:14] and the shepherd knows his sheep he has
[1:52:17] to
[1:52:17] live with the sheep he smells with the
[1:52:19] sheep they go in the thing and they
[1:52:20] close the door and he lays down and he
[1:52:22] becomes the protection of the sheep the
[1:52:24] wolves don't come in but there's another
[1:52:26] thing about a shepherd when he knows
[1:52:27] that a sheep's sick and sometimes
[1:52:29] there's a rock that has a mineral that
[1:52:31] that
[1:52:32] sheep needs and and that he needs to get
[1:52:35] the mineral out of that rock inside of
[1:52:36] that sheep
[1:52:38] but sheep just don't like the word of
[1:52:41] god sometimes
[1:52:42] they don't so what he does is he takes
[1:52:44] honey and he smears it all over the rock
[1:52:46] and that sheep just goes up starts
[1:52:48] licking that nice sweet honey
[1:52:50] and after he gets through the honey then
[1:52:51] that mineral that's in that rock begins
[1:52:53] to be
[1:52:53] absorbed into the sheep sometimes we get
[1:52:56] sick in our body and everything we need
[1:52:58] is in jesus christ the word of god
[1:53:01] and that shepherd will just maybe just a
[1:53:03] nice little kind text
[1:53:04] maybe a little song on the piano you
[1:53:06] come into the presence of the lord and
[1:53:08] the great shepherd is putting a little
[1:53:09] honey on that amen can you say amen to
[1:53:12] that a little word here a little
[1:53:13] kindness there
[1:53:14] how much love heals sometimes somebody
[1:53:16] just says hey i love you
[1:53:19] i shook somebody's hand the other i said
[1:53:20] god bless you friend brother sent me a
[1:53:22] text back he said you don't know how
[1:53:24] much that meant to me
[1:53:25] it's a cold world out there brother
[1:53:27] branham
[1:53:28] in the last brother said in the last day
[1:53:30] the love will be he said the love will
[1:53:31] only be among the bride the elected
[1:53:34] amen i say we start loving one another
[1:53:37] i said it's time we start loving one
[1:53:39] another
[1:53:41] we need love only perfect love is going
[1:53:43] to be there and we have the stigma
[1:53:45] you know i'm 52 years old i got a few
[1:53:46] miles behind me we got this stigma when
[1:53:48] i say i love you we think that we have
[1:53:50] to agree with that person
[1:53:53] i love my wife and we disagree so much
[1:53:55] on so much stuff
[1:53:57] and you know what we do we're adults we
[1:53:58] agree to disagree
[1:54:02] i think i'd ought to be over there and
[1:54:04] when you get together all you can see is
[1:54:06] that needs to be
[1:54:06] over there forget about that over there
[1:54:09] let's just be adults and get above
[1:54:11] the one percent we disagree on just be
[1:54:13] brothers and sisters and look at the 99
[1:54:15] we do agree on is that good is that
[1:54:17] wisdom i say lord let's just
[1:54:19] amen and so what the persecution has
[1:54:21] always made the church stronger and i
[1:54:23] don't want the persecution i'd rather
[1:54:24] just say lord
[1:54:25] what's the persecution it puts all the
[1:54:27] little nonsense away from us and we
[1:54:29] start agreeing on the things that are
[1:54:30] important
[1:54:31] jesus christ the blood of jesus christ
[1:54:34] the message of the hour so much that we
[1:54:36] have in common
[1:54:38] young people appreciate that about
[1:54:39] adults right stop your fussing and let's
[1:54:41] get together and be christians
[1:54:46] lord help us i'm just to skip over a lot
[1:54:50] of this so samson he got in the place he
[1:54:54] made a mistake like all of us
[1:54:55] uh sons of god they don't make mistakes
[1:54:57] yeah they do
[1:54:59] there's samson called by god he was one
[1:55:01] of the judges he goes out there and he
[1:55:02] had a problem
[1:55:03] with women he got caught by delilah not
[1:55:05] because he wanted to he just had a
[1:55:07] weakness and all of us have a weakness
[1:55:10] and so here he is and he's fallen to
[1:55:12] this place and he's grinding at the mill
[1:55:14] going through the grind of life why
[1:55:15] because he had
[1:55:16] he had got away from christ how many
[1:55:19] people are roaming in the wilderness
[1:55:20] because they got away from the great
[1:55:22] fountain filled with blood
[1:55:23] they got away from this holy spirit and
[1:55:25] the presence of god they were
[1:55:27] enticed by the world out there and it
[1:55:28] was a real enticement and here's samson
[1:55:30] up there and his eyes are out he's just
[1:55:31] grinding through
[1:55:32] paying alimony or paying his bills and
[1:55:34] life means nothing and
[1:55:36] oh brothers and sisters i don't want to
[1:55:38] be there but sometimes
[1:55:41] we can go there and the devil will tell
[1:55:44] you look at your end you're just
[1:55:45] this is the end you ever been there in
[1:55:48] your life
[1:55:49] i feel like man i just made a mess of
[1:55:50] this thing but it wasn't the end
[1:55:53] because his hair started to grow back he
[1:55:55] had a covenant with god
[1:55:58] so they bring him to hold him to the
[1:55:59] pillars and he's standing there at the
[1:56:00] pillars and
[1:56:01] brother ram said he could reach back and
[1:56:03] feel his hair growing back and knew he
[1:56:04] had a covenant he knew god had touched
[1:56:06] him you go back we don't have time to
[1:56:08] preach those sermons the bible says
[1:56:09] and the spirit of the lord began to move
[1:56:11] on samson at the camp you ever been to a
[1:56:14] youth camp and the holy spirit began to
[1:56:15] move on you
[1:56:16] maybe you went and made mistakes but
[1:56:17] that doesn't change the fact that god
[1:56:19] moved on you one time
[1:56:20] and god is not an indian giver if he
[1:56:22] moved on you one time there's a channel
[1:56:24] amen that's there and if you just move
[1:56:26] all the junk out away from it say lord i
[1:56:28] want to get back to my first love i
[1:56:29] think it says over there amen do your
[1:56:31] first works over and get back to your
[1:56:32] first love and here's samson
[1:56:34] they bring him to the pillars he said
[1:56:35] bring my my i put my hands on the
[1:56:38] pillars and
[1:56:38] and he prays he said lord remember me
[1:56:43] can you say that today wherever you are
[1:56:45] say lord remember me
[1:56:47] remember those times experiences i had
[1:56:49] with you
[1:56:50] and i'll say if you're not closer to god
[1:56:52] than today than you ever were
[1:56:53] you're backslid brother dan you just
[1:56:56] make this analogy so simple yeah we're
[1:56:58] climbing this hill
[1:56:59] and if you're not farther up that hill
[1:57:00] than you were before you've
[1:57:02] slid back in your christian life but
[1:57:05] that's not the end
[1:57:06] samson was there too i love the bible i
[1:57:09] love it it's written
[1:57:10] for our example so there was people
[1:57:11] before me that made mistakes and so he
[1:57:13] comes to a place he knew he had a
[1:57:14] covenant with god and he said lord
[1:57:16] remember me
[1:57:18] and he said lord strengthen me we need
[1:57:21] strength
[1:57:22] can you say it lord i need strength
[1:57:23] today lord i need the strength of the
[1:57:25] holy ghost
[1:57:26] and then he said lord avenge me of my
[1:57:28] enemies
[1:57:30] said lord let me die with my enemies
[1:57:32] amen we need to die to those things that
[1:57:34] have tried to pull us aside can you say
[1:57:36] amen to that
[1:57:36] you know whatever it is that you in your
[1:57:38] life you say look i want to die to this
[1:57:40] thing lord
[1:57:40] let me die to it maybe it's a hidden sin
[1:57:43] maybe it's a
[1:57:45] sin that so easily beset you it's like
[1:57:46] sam says lord remember me lord
[1:57:48] strengthen me right now that i can pray
[1:57:50] the next part of the prayer lord
[1:57:52] avenge me of my enemies let me destroy
[1:57:54] this thing
[1:57:56] the bible says he died but he killed
[1:57:57] more in his death
[1:57:59] than he did in his whole life amen
[1:58:02] i want to talk about that a little bit
[1:58:03] tonight about dying when we think we die
[1:58:06] to ourself we think it's the end but
[1:58:07] really it's not it's only the beginning
[1:58:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:58:13] i was just thinking about that because
[1:58:15] revelation chapter 3
[1:58:17] 14 there at the 20th verse in there he
[1:58:20] said
[1:58:21] if any man hear my voice and will open
[1:58:22] the door i will come into him
[1:58:24] you feel that little gentleness of the
[1:58:26] holy spirit here i'm not screaming i'm
[1:58:28] just trying to talk really soft
[1:58:31] because the holy spirit is speaking when
[1:58:33] he speaks then we just get real quiet
[1:58:35] because
[1:58:36] he's knocking and he said if any man can
[1:58:38] hear my voice
[1:58:40] it's not an auditory some of you all are
[1:58:42] scientists and you understand
[1:58:44] but it's it's beyond that it's a sixth
[1:58:46] sense it's when that sixth sense starts
[1:58:48] speaking to your heart
[1:58:49] knocking he said if any man will hear my
[1:58:51] voice
[1:58:53] i stand at the door knock if he'll open
[1:58:55] up his heart i will come into him
[1:58:57] oh i love the promises of god sometimes
[1:59:00] people
[1:59:01] you get lied to in the fine print and
[1:59:03] all that stuff but the word of god said
[1:59:04] if you hear my voice and you open the
[1:59:06] door i
[1:59:07] the creator will come into you and i'll
[1:59:09] sup with you
[1:59:11] and i'll fellowship with you and if
[1:59:13] you're fellowshipping with the god of
[1:59:14] mercy and the god of forgiveness why
[1:59:16] would he ever send you to hell
[1:59:18] i want to fellowship with you that's
[1:59:20] what we're coming for to communion
[1:59:21] tonight
[1:59:23] it's called communion because i want to
[1:59:25] talk to my creator maybe you've got a
[1:59:27] problem that's so big maybe you're sick
[1:59:28] in your body and say
[1:59:29] i want to go to the great physician and
[1:59:31] i want to talk to him i want to commune
[1:59:33] with him and say lord what about my
[1:59:34] sickness
[1:59:35] what about my sins or what about this
[1:59:37] situation what is
[1:59:39] and let's have a communion service
[1:59:41] tonight with the lord
[1:59:42] it's more than just a form i need to go
[1:59:43] up there and do this and this no
[1:59:45] it's a communion with jesus christ
[1:59:48] i tell you what i want to be hot for the
[1:59:50] whole for the lord jesus
[1:59:52] i want everything else in the world to
[1:59:54] be secondary to my love to jesus christ
[1:59:57] can you say amen to that i want to love
[1:59:59] him if i get sick he's there to heal me
[2:00:01] if i do wrong he's there to forgive me
[2:00:03] and i believe it's there i want to be
[2:00:05] baptized with the holy ghost i
[2:00:06] also want to be baptized in water if you
[2:00:08] haven't been baptized in water
[2:00:10] we've got a pool and i don't know how it
[2:00:11] all works but we'll get you baptized
[2:00:13] just like listen to the prophet's
[2:00:15] message if you're here today and you're
[2:00:16] not listening to the prophet's message
[2:00:18] and you want to you come see me or the
[2:00:20] elders and we'll figure out a way for
[2:00:21] you to hear god's prophet
[2:00:23] god sent a voice in this day the voice
[2:00:25] of god's prophet
[2:00:26] to guide us to to keep us in the path
[2:00:29] that we can go in a rapture today i
[2:00:30] don't have time to preach the whole
[2:00:32] rapture message but the first phase of
[2:00:33] it was a shout right
[2:00:35] brother iran said it's the living word
[2:00:36] of god to gather the people together
[2:00:38] and that's what this church is about
[2:00:40] it's the living word of god has come
[2:00:41] through a prophet and we're gathered
[2:00:43] together
[2:00:43] rallying around the son of man ministry
[2:00:45] that came in our day
[2:00:47] and what's the next part of it is the
[2:00:48] next part is the dead in christ will
[2:00:50] rise first we're looking for a
[2:00:51] resurrection
[2:00:52] looking for the saints to rise and
[2:00:54] brother green and the different ones
[2:00:55] that have gone on maybe you've got loved
[2:00:56] ones and the bible says the dead in
[2:00:58] christ shall rise first
[2:01:00] then we which are alive shall be changed
[2:01:02] in a moment and twinkling of an eye
[2:01:03] and then we'll be caught up to meet the
[2:01:05] lord in the air
[2:01:07] so if i throw out theology i want to see
[2:01:09] jesus that's all great but the bible
[2:01:11] says that the dead in christ will rise
[2:01:13] first
[2:01:14] and we'll be caught up with them to meet
[2:01:15] the lord in the air
[2:01:17] so don't throw those other people return
[2:01:19] ministry under the bus they have a truth
[2:01:26] see how people put little tags on people
[2:01:29] and then we throw people under the bus
[2:01:30] no we need to get back to the bible they
[2:01:33] look at us say look you got long hair
[2:01:35] skirt prophet you're a cult
[2:01:36] long hair skirt prophet called like paul
[2:01:38] said in the way that's called heresy
[2:01:41] so worship by the god of our fathers you
[2:01:43] can put whatever label on you
[2:01:44] i'm a christian i believe the bible what
[2:01:47] we believe is comes from the bible
[2:01:50] that's what's a matter or a message
[2:01:51] sometimes we get what we believe out
[2:01:53] here in the stars somewhere we need to
[2:01:54] say we believe the bible
[2:01:57] amen there's a lot of tags and we want
[2:01:59] to know the scripture
[2:02:01] amen you'll know the truth and the truth
[2:02:03] will make us free
[2:02:04] i believe we're gathered in the first
[2:02:05] phase of the rapture the message has
[2:02:07] come and this day have gathered us
[2:02:08] together
[2:02:09] and the saints are going to rise we're
[2:02:11] going to see him then we're going to be
[2:02:12] caught up to meet the lord
[2:02:14] in the air is that what the bible says
[2:02:16] that's not what brother daniel says is
[2:02:17] what the bible says i want to believe
[2:02:19] what the bible says
[2:02:20] and i believe that i believe god heals
[2:02:22] we were talking about that my wife
[2:02:25] thinking about that my wife last fall
[2:02:26] got really sick and
[2:02:28] really sick in her body we didn't know
[2:02:29] if we were going to have her around but
[2:02:31] we
[2:02:32] anointed her with oil and prayed for her
[2:02:34] and god healed her
[2:02:35] she's a he god's a healer
[2:02:39] i was thinking about that and my friend
[2:02:41] the other day i don't think i give the
[2:02:42] testimony here he's
[2:02:44] seven years with chronic pain in his
[2:02:46] back took pain medicine
[2:02:47] came together and there was some sin in
[2:02:49] his life and he he
[2:02:51] he confessed his sin we anointed him
[2:02:53] with oil and prayed the prayer of faith
[2:02:54] and he
[2:02:55] walked in my warehouse and i walked in
[2:02:57] there and he was down on his knees
[2:02:58] praying he come back out he said
[2:03:00] i haven't had a pain he said god
[2:03:01] completely healed me
[2:03:03] my god is a healer some of you probably
[2:03:06] heard the testament i think you all were

[2:03:22] they were holding him and he fell off
[2:03:24] and
[2:03:24] he hit the floor and landed on the
[2:03:25] concrete and and uh he's
[2:03:28] about six foot tall and dropped her off
[2:03:30] somebody did and dropped her and she and

[2:03:38] when i was looking this way and when i
[2:03:39] was looking this way he said i knew it

[2:03:43] jonathan we're at the reception the
[2:03:45] wedding

[2:03:48] present help in the time of trouble

[2:04:33] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:04:34] forever does the holy spirit witness you

[2:04:43] that's me that wrote that word
[2:04:45] amen the bible says the word of god holy
[2:04:48] men of god were moved by the holy ghost
[2:04:49] and they wrote the word of god and so

[2:04:52] spirit inside you say that's the truth

[2:04:55] you as a person may not even believe in
[2:04:56] the holy spirit say i believe it

[2:05:01] power that doth already work in me
[2:05:04] amen i want to have a revival in me i
[2:05:07] don't want to say where's the message
[2:05:08] the message is right here
[2:05:11] amen and where's that church brother
[2:05:12] madam is trying to get a church
[2:05:14] turned back to the faith of our fathers

[2:05:19] challenge it's a challenge to me

[2:05:23] jesus say and that's what i told brother
[2:05:24] brother when he called yesterday he's
[2:05:25] like all the things and i said brother
[2:05:27] don't lay your cross down
[2:05:29] jesus said who whosoever is not willing
[2:05:33] to take up his cross
[2:05:34] and follow me he's not worthy to be my
[2:05:37] disciple
[2:05:38] whole other sermon jesus wasn't looking
[2:05:40] for followers he was looking for
[2:05:41] disciples
[2:05:42] people that were willing to be
[2:05:44] disciplined by jesus christ
[2:05:46] i want to be disciplined by christ is it
[2:05:49] a cross yeah do you have to forfeit some
[2:05:51] of your
[2:05:51] natural goals and all those things but
[2:05:54] the bible says what
[2:05:55] would a man give in exchange for his
[2:05:57] soul
[2:05:58] what would a prophet a man if he gained
[2:06:00] the whole world
[2:06:03] and lost his soul you see we're the
[2:06:05] church of god we're the presence of god
[2:06:07] sometimes men we get out there and we
[2:06:08] get their
[2:06:09] ambitions and we get there in this and
[2:06:11] then we come to the church of god and
[2:06:12] holy spirit says
[2:06:13] wait just a minute what's your
[2:06:15] priorities
[2:06:16] to live 80 years and have a million
[2:06:18] dollars or live eternally
[2:06:20] with a new body a glorified body becomes
[2:06:23] more real as we grow older and we
[2:06:25] we know you're closer to 20 than i am
[2:06:27] brother
[2:06:28] amen amen that new body just one how's
[2:06:30] the bible say if this earthly tabernacle

[2:15:20] diminished in the hybrid food and our
[2:15:22] faith we didn't know so he'd give us the

[2:17:11] hour they begin to amend the man tells
[2:17:13] us that ten percent of
[2:17:14] of healing is miracles and the other
[2:17:16] ninety percent is divine healing
[2:17:19] when that power that works in you begins
[2:17:21] to work and it begins to change the
[2:17:22] situation and go a different direction
[2:17:25] we gotta believe it how long does your
[2:17:27] faith last
[2:17:28] how long does your healing last as long
[2:17:29] as your faith lasts brother branham how
[2:17:31] long are you saved as long as your faith
[2:17:33] lasts i don't believe i'm saved then
[2:17:35] you're not saved
[2:17:36] how long does your healing last as long
[2:17:37] as you confess i'm healed by his stripes
[2:17:39] i'm healed
[2:17:40] he's an intercessor based on your
[2:17:41] confession we need to confess by his
[2:17:43] stripes i'm healed lord i believe your
[2:17:45] word

[2:36:05] amen i love him with all my heart as the
[2:36:08] scripture says we love him because he
[2:36:10] first loved me
[2:36:12] and the bible says while we were yet
[2:36:13] sinners he loved us not when we were
[2:36:15] good but while we were sinners he loved
[2:36:17] us
[2:36:18] amen i was just wondering where brother
[2:36:19] peter was i wanted him to dismiss us in
[2:36:21] prayer did he
[2:36:23] come on up here brother he keeps
[2:36:25] disappearing
[2:36:27] i appreciate men of god that want to
[2:36:29] give their life and these
[2:36:30] elders brother aaron johnson and
[2:36:34] brother peter and each one brother ed
[2:36:37] and brother arnie brother jordan they've
[2:36:40] given their life to help
[2:36:42] have us a place we could worship aren't
[2:36:44] you thankful for that today
[2:36:46] men of god give their life that we could
[2:36:49] have a place
[2:36:50] amen come back tonight we're going to
[2:36:52] try to have communion
[2:36:54] have a real communion with the lord
[2:36:55] jesus you know we
[2:36:57] brother said the catholics have are
[2:36:59] closer to the scripture than we are he
[2:37:00] said every time they came together they
[2:37:02] broke bread
[2:37:03] maybe we have a tradition this covets
[2:37:05] kind of pushed it out
[2:37:06] in the bible they broke bread every time
[2:37:08] they come together oh i'd tell you do us
[2:37:10] good we get together people get together
[2:37:12] for bridal showers and birthday parties
[2:37:14] and
[2:37:14] sports and all those things but in the
[2:37:16] bible when they got together they had
[2:37:18] communion
[2:37:19] and they realized yeah we're here for
[2:37:20] this and this but the main thing that
[2:37:23] brings us together is the death of jesus
[2:37:25] christ
[2:37:26] you see how the church gets mixed up in
[2:37:28] the world instead of the church being
[2:37:29] the church
[2:37:30] we're together as christians because we
[2:37:33] are christians
[2:37:34] it's time we let the church be the
[2:37:35] church of god and let the cross of
[2:37:37] jesus christ and the blood of jesus
[2:37:39] christ be the thing that joins us all
[2:37:41] together
[2:37:41] not our fishing trip and our hunting
[2:37:43] trip and the status and
[2:37:44] is everybody with me sometimes we get
[2:37:46] our eyes out here in the world instead
[2:37:48] of what the church of god
[2:37:49] really is it's full of power it's full
[2:37:52] of glory
[2:37:53] it's without spot it's without wrinkle
[2:37:55] there's a church that christ
[2:37:56] is coming back for it's a holy ghost
[2:37:58] filled church it's a blood
[2:38:00] washed church i want to be part of that
[2:38:02] church i want the
[2:38:03] revival to be inside of me i don't want
[2:38:05] to look back say well back in brother
[2:38:07] branham's day
[2:38:08] and i appreciate all those stories but i
[2:38:10] want the god of william branham to live
[2:38:12] in our hearts today
[2:38:13] and i believe he's the same yesterday
