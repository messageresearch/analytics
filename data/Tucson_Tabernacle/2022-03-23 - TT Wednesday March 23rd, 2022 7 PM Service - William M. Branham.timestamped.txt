[39:56] america to canada they farted out of
[39:59] many countries and many states in the
[40:00] union
[40:02] and yet we americans plunged headlong
[40:04] into it the other day seeing where a
[40:06] young man it's one of the heads of this
[40:09] rock and roll and going through all
[40:10] these maneuvers he said he learned it in
[40:12] a pentecostal church
[40:14] and i think that that would be perverted
[40:16] no one of the boys got a perverted mind
[40:19] going crazy
[40:20] certainly god will punish him and he
[40:22] will
[40:23] certainly for such as that have
[40:25] sacrifices
[40:26] and it's
[40:27] it's absolutely blasphemy of the holy
[40:30] ghost
[40:31] and
[40:31] it's terrible to see how that people can
[40:34] kind of belittle the words of the living
[40:36] god as you soul so shall you read
[40:40] remember that i'll thank you can i
[40:42] forget just how many it was at the first
[40:45] morning
[40:47] outfits they had up there how many
[40:49] children how many young people that lost
[40:51] their mind over that one meeting and the
[40:52] insane institution now
[40:54] without hope without god without and
[40:57] mercy
[40:58] laying there in that condition screaming
[41:00] and crying and walking the up and down
[41:02] button our heads against the wall or
[41:04] that kind of nonsense and we make it
[41:06] wrinkled
[41:08] drink gamble a lot of places that allow
[41:10] the kids to smoke in the church at
[41:12] school just before semester and so forth
[41:14] isn't that terrible they're quieting
[41:16] their nerves or they have a prayer
[41:18] meeting that's the best
[41:22] but you know hungry people have got to
[41:25] fill that longing with something if they
[41:27] won't drink from the fountain of the
[41:29] waters of life the devil will give them
[41:31] a stagnated system with wiggles
[41:34] [Music]
[41:35] so they'll ring from somewhere you'll
[41:38] spend that loyalty and worship either on
[41:40] the devil or on god never one other
[41:43] person never went to one of those places
[41:45] or done any of those things except it
[41:47] was a hungry-hearted person that refused
[41:50] to drink from the fountain of the waters
[41:52] of life freezing
[41:54] ah
[41:55] i'll tell you i feel sorry for them
[41:57] because of the let down and pollution of
[41:59] our modern churches that's one of the
[42:02] things that i lay it to this social
[42:04] gospel that people preach while in our
[42:07] own city of jeffersonville
[42:10] a certain pastor every saturday night
[42:13] has a square dance at the bottom of the
[42:15] church
[42:16] ryan teach the square dancing of a very
[42:19] famous denominational church
[42:22] a square name
[42:23] that was the same pastor that asked me
[42:25] that time coming down the telephone pole
[42:27] how i got so many people the house and
[42:29] tabernacles that he signed i made him
[42:31] sign a card a thousand members that they
[42:34] would attend sunday school at least one
[42:36] time out of the year
[42:37] or one or six months out of every year's
[42:39] workbook he said you don't have any
[42:41] answers except two
[42:42] i said no wonder i don't blame them i
[42:44] wouldn't either it's actually like as
[42:46] long as you're having shin digs and
[42:48] things in the church well that's a sin
[42:50] i don't belong in the house of god
[42:53] i have to have something like that to
[42:54] get a people listen to me i'll sure go
[42:57] off the field of the gospel preaching
[42:58] the gospel
[43:00] i don't blame sinners when you see
[43:02] sinners going out there this whole rank
[43:04] low down
[43:05] centers well i don't blame them that's
[43:07] all they know but these people who go to
[43:10] church and call themselves christians
[43:13] i don't blame a pig from rooting in a
[43:15] manure pile certainly not that's his
[43:17] nature
[43:18] certainly i would think this train see a
[43:20] pig in the newer pounds or not that's
[43:22] his nature that's what he does
[43:24] that's his living you don't know any
[43:26] different
[43:27] but i sure feel funny about seeing a
[43:29] lamb doing that and
[43:31] praying that he wouldn't do it
[43:33] and that's way to the center let him go
[43:35] ahead that's all he knows drink all the
[43:38] booze he wants to go all the low downs
[43:40] and hold down to listen to all that
[43:41] nonsense that's all he knows
[43:44] but do you think we're supposed to know
[43:45] better that's right i've persuaded if
[43:48] you ever turn to that you never really
[43:50] drink from the fountain of the lord i
[43:52] tell you that just that just cuts all
[43:54] that other stuff this is midnight
[43:57] there's no joy to it it's saying
[44:00] you can't even stand it i go into a
[44:02] restaurant sometime first thing i do i
[44:04] look through and see if you got one
[44:05] little
[44:06] penny or nipple uh jukeboxes on the wall
[44:09] and things make me so nervous i can i i
[44:12] have a sour stomach after i come out
[44:14] just to hear all that
[44:15] nonsense
[44:17] and see christians playing
[44:20] supposed to be christian
[44:22] brother by the fruits you know
[44:26] well that ain't my subject
[44:28] but
[44:29] i tell you it's too bad that we don't
[44:32] have a little more
[44:34] contenting
[44:41] the baptist church but not the guy
[44:43] having shake hands about your name on
[44:45] the book brother we get out the door and
[44:46] beat one another back so he come through
[44:49] we had something
[44:50] yes sir and one of those people was
[44:52] caught all those kind of places they
[44:54] were put right on the cards if it was
[44:55] sold they either repented or
[44:57] excommunicated right there we didn't
[44:59] work yet you yoke yourself up with
[45:01] unbelievers they either walk the street
[45:03] narrow line but had a blackboard sit
[45:05] there and if anybody had ingredients to
[45:06] steam one to it they put all their names
[45:08] on the blackboard i got them both in the
[45:09] prayer room
[45:11] somebody come in like jones up to the
[45:13] top next was
[45:14] uh scott at the bottom all right brother
[45:17] jones jim brother scott come in here
[45:18] with me
[45:19] that's right head straighten it out
[45:21] right then have it be made right church
[45:23] rolled on
[45:24] that's what we need to know
[45:26] there's a good old fashioned bat woods
[45:29] sing killing sky
[45:44] right
[45:46] amen
[45:47] now remember the services now may the
[45:50] lord bless us as we open his word to
[45:52] read just a few uh
[45:55] scriptures here and then speak to you on
[45:58] the word and everybody be
[45:59] solely and in prayer believing with all
[46:02] your heart
[46:04] and i'm wondering tonight
[46:06] some of them would tell me about a
[46:07] little baby the last one was prayed for
[46:10] last night the little fella got started
[46:12] crying right didn't that baby here
[46:14] tonight
[46:15] would have to be that the little fella
[46:16] was sure i'd like him to climb up to the
[46:18] platform here just a moment if he did
[46:22] um
[46:25] i guess they might have been from out i
[46:26] don't know them keeps me it's in a
[46:28] semi-conscious condition and
[46:31] my son was telling me going out said
[46:33] daddy it was a marvelous thing he said a
[46:35] little boy come in the line down there
[46:37] look i think he said a cross-eyed and
[46:39] had a
[46:40] rupture or something other and say when
[46:42] you pick the child up i think you put
[46:44] your hands over that place and it went
[46:46] away
[46:47] he said and when the child opened his
[46:48] eyes and when you had your hand laying
[46:50] on it said i noticed his eyes as
[46:52] perfectly straight as it could be and
[46:53] said you're trying to get him to look to
[46:54] the audience and i just wondered if he
[46:56] was here tonight maybe he'd be back and
[46:59] we're thanking the lord for his healing
[47:01] now the lord can heal all kinds of
[47:03] diseases if we can believe him to do it
[47:06] i've not seen him do so many things i
[47:08] just want to believe that everything we
[47:10] ask for
[47:12] that's right we gotta believe it that
[47:13] way
[47:14] and now we trust that the lord will
[47:16] bless
[47:17] now
[47:18] this blessed old book is the book of all
[47:21] books
[47:22] and there's only one candidate rightly
[47:25] interpret this book and that's the holy
[47:27] spirit
[47:28] he's a writer
[47:30] and it's the only one that can really
[47:32] interpret no matter how well we think we
[47:35] know it we don't know it until the holy
[47:37] spirit has revealed it because it's it's
[47:40] all in mystery it's all cut up in
[47:42] mystery and god said he did it
[47:44] personally so he could hide it from the
[47:45] smart and wise but he would reveal it
[47:48] the veins such as we learned now we want
[47:50] to be babes in the lord tonight
[47:53] just see how simple you can be
[47:55] and tomorrow night i think i have the
[47:57] lord willing i have a message on that on
[48:00] the simplicity of it so now let us bower
[48:03] it's just one more moment to speak how
[48:06] many has a knee tonight would you raise
[48:08] your hands i want to be remembered in
[48:09] this brother
[48:10] i want you to remember me before the
[48:12] lord
[48:13] our heavenly father
[48:15] in the name of jesus our beloved child
[48:18] we come as humbly as we know how
[48:21] and ask you for forgiveness of our sins
[48:24] and trespasses
[48:26] whatever we have dinner said to this day
[48:28] or any other time in our life that's
[48:31] against us tonight we humbly bow and
[48:33] confess
[48:35] and i pray for this audience of people
[48:38] as they raise their hands
[48:40] many of them father are maybe
[48:42] desperately in need of forgiveness
[48:45] some but setting sin some habit
[48:48] some sickness some disease or affliction
[48:51] some loved one that's in trouble
[48:54] whatever it is father i pray that you
[48:56] forgive and forget
[48:58] all their iniquity and heal all their
[49:01] diseases and pour out thy blessings upon
[49:04] us tonight through the reading of the
[49:06] word and the preaching of the word or we
[49:08] asked it in christ's name
[49:10] our beloved son amen
[49:15] in the second kings
[49:18] and
[49:19] the third
[49:20] third chapter of the second kings
[49:23] and the 16th verse
[49:26] and he said thus saith the lord
[49:29] make this valley full of niches
[49:32] now may the lord add his blessings to
[49:34] the reading of his word
[49:38] this was
[49:40] in the book of second kings the third
[49:42] chapter
[49:43] and maybe when you would go home
[49:45] how many reads the bible let's see your
[49:47] hand oh it's wonderful
[49:49] read it study it
[49:52] and you especially you born again
[49:54] christians that's the
[49:55] the
[49:56] bread and the meat for the holy spirit
[50:01] man shall not live by bread alone
[50:04] but by every word that's right that
[50:07] proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen
[50:10] what if i was a doctor tonight the young
[50:13] fellow come to me
[50:14] i had a great frame on him and yet he
[50:17] looked so weak and run down i said
[50:19] what's the matter son he said i'm just a
[50:21] weak doctor i can't always stand up i
[50:23] ask them a few physical things all right
[50:25] they're all right
[50:27] i said what makes you weak i don't know
[50:28] doctor i would say well when did she eat
[50:30] that well i eat a half a cracker a day
[50:32] before yesterday
[50:34] was the only thing you need is a good
[50:36] square of evil
[50:37] you become anemia you become run down we
[50:41] that's what's made of the church you've
[50:43] got to have a good square gospel meal
[50:46] that i ever age that's right if you
[50:48] don't
[50:49] you're going to be anemia you're going
[50:50] to get run down
[50:52] taking a lot of god's vitamins out of
[50:54] his word and it certainly does bring up
[50:57] the spirit
[50:58] and makes you feel repressed and renewed
[51:02] now
[51:03] it's just been a great event taking
[51:05] place
[51:07] and there's been a house cleaning time
[51:09] in israel
[51:10] but the bad part of it was by the vote
[51:14] of the people and the run of the
[51:17] of the way they voted in they had just
[51:20] not made it as bad as what they would
[51:24] today if one pastor would leave the
[51:26] church and the deacon board would go in
[51:28] another who sometimes has taken out a
[51:31] good one a bad one
[51:33] but when god sends one along he's the
[51:35] right man
[51:37] always you should pray
[51:39] and seek god's favor you who are have
[51:42] such to select your pastor
[51:44] but now it was in the days of elijah
[51:48] elijah the mighty prophet of the lord
[51:52] oh god what will we do if we didn't have
[51:56] some man of god in the world that would
[51:58] stand in the preaching and try to
[52:01] intercede for the people and with enough
[52:04] nerve to tell the people are not enough
[52:06] nerve but enough grace
[52:08] to tell the people what's right and
[52:11] wrong
[52:12] a whole lot of that is a matter of the
[52:15] troubles today
[52:16] is because man in one sense i'm not
[52:20] condemning my brethren certainly not
[52:23] i'm i'm only trying to present a truth
[52:27] the only reason today
[52:29] that the conditions are if every pastor
[52:32] would have stood firm on the word
[52:35] and not let out or compromise
[52:38] it wouldn't be like it is today
[52:41] but a compromising
[52:44] self-sufficient
[52:46] organizations
[52:48] and so forth has always tried to take
[52:51] the place of the holy spirit and
[52:54] god never did have any kind a group of
[52:58] man to run his church it's always been
[53:02] the holy spirit
[53:04] that's his duty that's right that's what
[53:06] he shared
[53:08] that's what god sent him for he will
[53:10] teach you
[53:12] he will guide you into all truth
[53:15] and will show you things to come
[53:18] and reveal these things take these
[53:20] things of mine and reveal them to you
[53:23] not the seminary as good as they are
[53:26] not the church as good as it is but the
[53:28] holy spirit
[53:30] that's the teacher right amen and we
[53:33] tried to adopt man to take the holy
[53:35] spirit's place
[53:37] we tried to adopt certain different
[53:39] offices in the church to take the
[53:41] offices of the apostle prophet and so
[53:44] forth in the church that god set the
[53:47] gifts in the church and we helped man
[53:49] and made him gifts instead of god's gift
[53:51] and that's what we're in today
[53:54] now
[53:55] elijah was a great man
[53:57] and his time had come for him to leave
[54:00] the earth and he walked before the lord
[54:03] and the lord
[54:04] told him go and anoint another man
[54:09] i love that don't you love that god has
[54:13] never been without a witness that's
[54:16] right amen
[54:17] god's always had a witness since the
[54:19] world began
[54:20] sometimes come down to one man but god's
[54:24] always had someone he could lay his
[54:26] finger on and say this is my servant all
[54:30] ages
[54:31] now and when he said he was going to
[54:33] take elijah elijah
[54:36] the fish fight went and found elijah
[54:39] crying in the field and took off his
[54:41] rope and threw it on him and he knew he
[54:43] was called to be the prophet
[54:46] then to show how a prophet should he
[54:49] burn every bridge as we call it he
[54:51] killed the ox took the yokes the plan
[54:54] and made a sacrifice to the lord showing
[54:56] that all of his earthly doings were over
[55:00] he was completely sold out to the lord
[55:03] amen that's the kind way every man and
[55:06] woman that comes to christ's heart to
[55:09] completely sell out the sin and
[55:11] everything behind him
[55:12] proves a separating line and look only
[55:15] to god from now on
[55:17] what a difference it would be if men and
[55:19] women would do that
[55:21] that to giving this test
[55:23] do you believe in the testings and
[55:25] trying trials of the lord
[55:28] every son without any exception
[55:31] every son that cometh to god that's
[55:33] first be
[55:34] tested
[55:36] tried
[55:37] child trained
[55:39] remember how you got your training
[55:41] i remember how i got mine
[55:43] my daddy had a he believed in the golden
[55:46] rule
[55:47] and he had it and it laid up where the
[55:50] door had all the team commandments on
[55:52] a big long hickory stick about this long
[55:55] with a brush on the end of it i'm
[55:57] telling you when that little brand's
[55:58] done wrong they didn't know what the
[55:59] golden rule
[56:04] and you say now tomorrow i'm really
[56:07] going to pan to you
[56:09] why don't you do it now papa

[56:48] if we had some more that would do like
[56:50] that today

[56:53] delinquency

[59:13] wrong man and boys and girls in the
[59:15] world tonight
[59:17] let one of them stretch yourself and
[59:18] some of these old dirty clothes like you
[59:20] let your kids wear out your little
[59:22] sharks and whatever what you call them
[59:25] and let them one time
[59:27] you find out how illiterate they were
[59:30] beat her until she'd be so well she
[59:32] couldn't get the clothes on top of them
[59:35] that's what needs to be done tonight
[59:38] that's right and some of these 65
[59:40] preachers stand in the full pit and left
[59:42] their choirs sing and they go out on the
[59:44] afternoon and stretch out those things
[59:47] shame on you to call yourself a man of
[59:49] god
[59:50] you got a wishbone and not a backbone
[59:52] you had the holy ghost to make you act
[59:54] different from that and talk different
[59:56] from that and make you call black black
[59:58] and white white yes
[1:00:00] yes sir
[1:00:02] but the trouble of it is all mine you're
[1:00:04] so feminist anyhow little why
[1:00:07] don't you get a backbone get the holy
[1:00:09] ghost
[1:00:10] john the baptist was the first one to
[1:00:12] receive the holy ghost and he walked
[1:00:14] right up to old head and said it's not
[1:00:16] lawful for you to have your brother's
[1:00:18] wife that's right brother that's the way
[1:00:20] a man feel the holy ghost when he sees
[1:00:21] something wrong he calls it wrong
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:25] certainly
[1:00:26] now
[1:00:27] was that type of man and when elijah
[1:00:30] knew that he was to take his place
[1:00:32] elijah gave him a trial he said you stay
[1:00:34] here because i'm going to another city
[1:00:38] and he elijah knew that he had to watch
[1:00:40] him he's inspired he says that the lord
[1:00:42] liveth on your soul to die i'll not
[1:00:46] depart from you on and on they went
[1:00:48] until finally the last trial and they
[1:00:50] crossed jordan
[1:00:52] he said now what can i do bargain he
[1:00:55] said that a double portion of your
[1:00:57] spirit would come up on me
[1:01:00] now that seems strange the spirit of a
[1:01:02] man coming up on another i want a double
[1:01:05] potion of your spirit that you've asked
[1:01:07] a hard thing but nevertheless if you see
[1:01:10] me when i go you'll have it
[1:01:12] so they walked on and after a while the
[1:01:16] chariots of pine horses of fire came
[1:01:18] down and elijah stepped on and pulled
[1:01:20] off his robe and threw it back to elijah
[1:01:23] and he put it on and walked down to the
[1:01:25] river with a double potion of the spirit
[1:01:29] of elijah a beautiful type of the church
[1:01:33] jesus said these things that i do shout
[1:01:36] you also have more than this shall you
[1:01:38] do
[1:01:39] can you be baptized for the baptism i am
[1:01:41] baptized with can you drink from the cup
[1:01:44] that i drink said yes you will
[1:01:46] and a double potion
[1:01:49] you see it
[1:01:50] out of the holy spirit was to come upon
[1:01:52] the church
[1:01:53] and a double of what jesus did was to be
[1:01:56] done by the church
[1:01:58] or where is the faith of the church
[1:02:00] tonight my god that's a praise
[1:02:04] god back in the shell like a turtle
[1:02:06] time
[1:02:08] now listen
[1:02:09] the only thing that you need to do is to
[1:02:12] come out
[1:02:14] notice then when he walked down he began
[1:02:17] to perform
[1:02:18] miracles and one on eight elijah and
[1:02:22] elisha was 16 a double potion of the
[1:02:25] spirit was upon him during that time old
[1:02:28] king ahab
[1:02:30] had died because the prophet had told
[1:02:33] him how his end was going to be
[1:02:35] and his little pain in face white she
[1:02:38] died too and the dog's eater just
[1:02:40] according to the word of the lord
[1:02:43] she hated that preacher worse than
[1:02:45] anything
[1:02:46] because he was always telling her how
[1:02:49] about her sin how could he be honest and
[1:02:52] sincere with god and keep from doing it
[1:02:56] god had told me that he was going to
[1:02:59] feed her to the dogs
[1:03:00] and she didn't become nothing but dog
[1:03:02] meat
[1:03:03] and so no matter how much your little
[1:03:05] pretty painted up rose gold lips was
[1:03:07] when she stole them up oh jay who said
[1:03:09] turn off the window
[1:03:12] she wasn't vamping him with her vampy
[1:03:14] eyes he was the man of god
[1:03:17] they cried out the window and the dogs
[1:03:19] eat her up on the street that's right
[1:03:22] and then when they went to slept in
[1:03:24] another they got jerome his son
[1:03:28] and her son now you couldn't expect very
[1:03:31] much to come out of a marriage like that
[1:03:34] so then we find out that when jerome had
[1:03:37] ascended to the throne
[1:03:39] he was a borderline believer
[1:03:42] just a halfway lukewarm
[1:03:45] believer
[1:03:47] so many of them in the world tonight
[1:03:50] jeremy just said he sailed anyway the
[1:03:52] wind was blowing that's the way jerome
[1:03:54] would go
[1:03:55] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:03:57] tonight they set their sales to every
[1:04:00] form of doctrine
[1:04:01] talks about them
[1:04:04] not knowing where to stand or what to do
[1:04:06] when their little trials come up the
[1:04:08] little frictions away they go this way
[1:04:10] they're not tomorrow pentecostal next
[1:04:13] day of lutheran the next day
[1:04:15] seventy-eight minutes jehovah witness
[1:04:16] they don't know where to stand
[1:04:19] about borderline
[1:04:22] packing your church letter from one
[1:04:24] place to what doesn't do anyhow
[1:04:27] but apart in heaven
[1:04:29] that's where it'll be recognized that's
[1:04:31] right notice
[1:04:33] dan
[1:04:34] a lukewarm preacher
[1:04:36] or believer so many tonight are in the
[1:04:39] same way
[1:04:40] they're with the crowd
[1:04:42] if they're in the crowd they'll do as
[1:04:44] the crowd does next they make their way
[1:04:46] back to church here some time ago
[1:04:48] a young man told me he said preacher i'm
[1:04:51] not a christian he said i'm ashamed to
[1:04:53] admit it i said now these hopes for you
[1:04:56] when you're ashamed to admit it
[1:04:58] he said i'm not a christian i'm ashamed
[1:05:00] of it but i took a certain girl tonight
[1:05:03] a boy another boy i had her now and she
[1:05:06] was so drunk she couldn't hardly get in
[1:05:08] and we walked her and gave her soft
[1:05:11] water to vomit it up she had to be sober
[1:05:13] enough to tan shirts the next morning
[1:05:15] and said if you'll wake up come out and
[1:05:16] get another bottle we'll be on the road
[1:05:18] again and she was a singing in the car
[1:05:24] and her sister talked sunday school and
[1:05:26] wasn't any better
[1:05:28] no wonder we've got a bunch of
[1:05:30] infotainment skeptics and
[1:05:33] believers and make believers and
[1:05:35] everything else the church needs an old
[1:05:37] passion holy ghost god sent revival
[1:05:41] and creatures together
[1:05:46] right
[1:05:47] let the righteous wrath of god rained
[1:05:50] down through old-fashioned hell fine
[1:05:52] brimstone preaching too bad he ever got
[1:05:54] away with an insensibility
[1:05:57] when the holy spirit left the man he
[1:05:59] didn't know better why we need the
[1:06:01] returning of the holy spirit
[1:06:04] yes sir
[1:06:05] now
[1:06:06] borderline
[1:06:09] here's some time ago
[1:06:10] a young lady right in our city
[1:06:14] everybody thought last summer his little
[1:06:16] girl went out there at the church get
[1:06:18] long hair and slit your air right back
[1:06:20] to
[1:06:21] her face and just about as slick as the
[1:06:23] peeled onion i guess
[1:06:24] but she was really a genuine christian
[1:06:28] born again
[1:06:30] so this little girl that went to a
[1:06:32] modernistic affair down there
[1:06:35] she's better on the streets she said
[1:06:38] rose you don't want
[1:06:40] said you'd be a pretty girl if you just
[1:06:43] use a little bit of that
[1:06:45] and if you'd wear this kind of clothes
[1:06:47] and that kind of coat she said i'll wear
[1:06:49] just exactly what i want to wear
[1:06:53] oh that was telling her she said the
[1:06:55] trouble of this is that narrow-minded
[1:06:58] preacher pastor billy you got us there
[1:07:02] said that god would have been the insane
[1:07:03] institution
[1:07:06] and the little girl said well if you had
[1:07:08] what we had a bed you wouldn't be
[1:07:10] looking the way you're looking now
[1:07:14] she told her about yet she was a sunday
[1:07:16] school teacher
[1:07:17] now mr perkins a friend of mine dear
[1:07:19] friend at jeffersonville he had the in
[1:07:23] the embalming at the
[1:07:25] undertaker example
[1:07:26] and then this girl taken down sick
[1:07:30] and they didn't know what it wasn't it
[1:07:31] was an ill
[1:07:32] and the family never let it out because
[1:07:34] it was a disgrace
[1:07:37] and when the girl
[1:07:39] had taken down this disease and she
[1:07:41] started to die
[1:07:43] she called for the pastor and the
[1:07:46] church to come and sing hymns to her
[1:07:49] and when she was singing out there they
[1:07:51] were and death struck her if every one
[1:07:54] time that you'll get right with god or
[1:07:57] try to as my death really sit down
[1:08:00] and when death struck her
[1:08:03] the pastor she began to kind of begin to
[1:08:05] scream she said i'm lost
[1:08:07] another pastor said here here here you
[1:08:10] can't act like that said you know you're
[1:08:11] saying i'm lost he called the doctor and
[1:08:15] put a high pole in her arm and she told
[1:08:17] him she said you deceive her she said
[1:08:20] i'm lost and i'm going to hell
[1:08:23] and you're the cause
[1:08:25] and she said stand for that aurora
[1:08:28] mahoney just as quick as you can and get
[1:08:30] her here
[1:08:31] and she'll pray for me but they couldn't
[1:08:33] get the girl should already die
[1:08:35] and when mr perkins told me he said
[1:08:37] billy when i was pumping the fluid into
[1:08:39] that girl we we noticed that
[1:08:42] i began to smell it but she's taking too
[1:08:44] much fluid for her body
[1:08:45] and so we had to examine her and when
[1:08:47] they did there was holes eating that
[1:08:49] everywhere were nero
[1:08:53] and there she was died oh my and that
[1:08:57] disgrace is all because
[1:09:01] that she was told that tap dancing and
[1:09:04] all the other
[1:09:05] nonsense it goes with the simple
[1:09:07] vaseline life was all right by a babson
[1:09:11] preacher oh my god that was the cause of
[1:09:14] it and she spent it to his face in the
[1:09:16] days of her death and what will she do
[1:09:19] younger worldly has to stand in the
[1:09:20] presence of god and give account for
[1:09:23] everything that's done and god will
[1:09:24] require that jesus's hand that's real
[1:09:27] soul that's right certainly it is true
[1:09:30] that's right over
[1:09:32] what we
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:47] that have taken place that still hangs
[1:09:49] on a record in jeffersonville of how
[1:09:51] that girl went out of line
[1:09:53] now a borderline
[1:09:56] lukewarm
[1:09:57] they try to make it smooth that's why
[1:10:00] this jerome was just a borderline
[1:10:02] preacher and he
[1:10:04] every way the people they wanted to do
[1:10:06] this one all right they want to do that
[1:10:08] all right but yet he claimed to be a
[1:10:10] christian or a believer
[1:10:12] and first thing you know there was more
[1:10:15] rebelled against israel
[1:10:17] so then he called for help now
[1:10:20] the king of judah
[1:10:22] was
[1:10:23] jehoshaphat and jehoshaphat was a
[1:10:26] righteous man
[1:10:28] now i want you to notice how easy it is
[1:10:31] sometimes on a little persuasion for a
[1:10:35] christian to get into the wrong company
[1:10:38] trying to be pity
[1:10:41] well i'll tell you i'll just put out the
[1:10:43] pool room i won't play any pool but i'll
[1:10:46] go down i'll go to dance with susie
[1:10:48] because she's a good girl and maybe i
[1:10:50] could win her to the lord you'll never
[1:10:52] do it doing that
[1:10:54] right show your colors
[1:10:57] right
[1:10:58] don't get on the wrong ground
[1:11:01] that's what's the matter with the
[1:11:02] pentecostal church tonight it got on the
[1:11:05] wrong ground
[1:11:08] that's the reason of church tonight the
[1:11:10] people it used to be wrong for the
[1:11:13] people to do certain things now it's not
[1:11:15] wrong to do it anyhow
[1:11:17] you've got on the wrong grounds you got
[1:11:19] with the wrong crowd
[1:11:21] show me your company i'll tell you who
[1:11:23] you are
[1:11:24] let me walk into your house
[1:11:26] let me see what's laying over on the
[1:11:29] table let me see how that bible is
[1:11:32] marked up
[1:11:33] let me see what's all true stories let
[1:11:35] me listen to what kind of music you're
[1:11:37] running on your radio
[1:11:39] let me see what kind of pictures you got
[1:11:40] in your house i'll tell you what you're
[1:11:42] made out of
[1:11:44] yes sir that's what your souls are
[1:11:46] feeding on regardless of what your
[1:11:48] testimony is your fruits prove what you
[1:11:51] are
[1:11:52] [Music]
[1:11:52] [Applause]
[1:11:54] oh it's the truth your soul feeds on
[1:11:57] something
[1:11:59] and whatever the characteristic of your
[1:12:01] soul is that's what it'll show for
[1:12:04] that's the reason jesus said by their
[1:12:06] fruits you shine all them
[1:12:08] you talk a lot of advantage of saying i
[1:12:10] spoke in tongues i got the holy ghost if
[1:12:13] your life didn't type up with it you
[1:12:14] didn't do it you either got the devil or
[1:12:17] the flesh
[1:12:19] i'm talking to the pentecostal people
[1:12:21] are you bad that's already shallower
[1:12:23] than you presenterians
[1:12:24] sure
[1:12:25] that's right
[1:12:27] now
[1:12:28] i don't care what kind of a sign you
[1:12:30] might have cried tears like a crocodile
[1:12:33] and you might have moaned at the bench i
[1:12:36] don't mean you're saved your life proves
[1:12:38] what you are
[1:12:41] if you ever hear a goat blade a goat
[1:12:43] that sheeps almost the same thing
[1:12:46] i've heard goats crying when it's act
[1:12:48] like sheep it takes a real shepherd to
[1:12:51] know the difference
[1:12:53] do you hear a goat squealing it sounds
[1:12:55] just exactly like a sheep
[1:12:57] but a shepherd knows the voice
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:02] now
[1:13:03] but something happened
[1:13:06] and we find out that this jehoshaphat
[1:13:09] all over spell of emotion before praying
[1:13:12] over
[1:13:14] before you cut your hair sister did you
[1:13:16] get out and pray over
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:30] i'm afraid you didn't you have your mind
[1:13:33] already made up what you go to do before
[1:13:35] you pray
[1:13:36] that's right
[1:13:38] are you willing to as i said tonight god
[1:13:40] share all things off of you
[1:13:43] take all your your rights you say this
[1:13:45] in my life i'm an american i don't do i
[1:13:47] won't do that right but are you willing
[1:13:48] to forfeit them
[1:13:50] to the kingdom of god if you're a lamb
[1:13:52] you are
[1:13:53] if you're a vulture
[1:13:55] so there you are
[1:13:57] so now you might bleed and crying you
[1:13:59] might act like it you might eat the same
[1:14:01] grass
[1:14:02] that the goat from the shaped up and
[1:14:04] over the orange you're not long ago i
[1:14:06] seen a shepherd and he was hurting
[1:14:08] sheep
[1:14:10] goats
[1:14:11] donkeys and cannons all the same breads
[1:14:14] and i said what does a shepherd mean he
[1:14:16] said the shepherd is a grazer
[1:14:19] said like you'd call in america your
[1:14:20] cowboy
[1:14:22] and i said well then why is it that he's
[1:14:24] hurting the goats and everything he said
[1:14:26] that's right
[1:14:27] oh i said i see he said but brother
[1:14:29] branham when night time comes
[1:14:32] the everything is left on the pasture
[1:14:34] except the sheep and the sheep stuck to
[1:14:36] the bowl
[1:14:37] and he lays down to the door to see that
[1:14:39] nothing bothers them that i see you can
[1:14:43] set the same church shop for the same
[1:14:45] gospel but if your nature isn't
[1:14:47] different you will never be recognized
[1:14:49] at the setting of the sun
[1:14:52] that's right preachers have to be in
[1:14:54] your heart not in your head
[1:14:56] you say i'd like to do that but i better
[1:14:58] not do it because the church wouldn't
[1:14:59] like it i don't think you knew what the
[1:15:01] church says it's what god said
[1:15:04] what your conscience says what the holy
[1:15:06] spirit says in him god amen
[1:15:09] right he said you love the world or
[1:15:11] things of the world love it god's not
[1:15:13] even in you that's all right so don't
[1:15:15] feel borderline come out and be one side
[1:15:17] or the other
[1:15:18] let your colors shine that's right now i
[1:15:21] want you to notice
[1:15:23] jehoshaphat got messing around and he
[1:15:25] got with that crown they said will you
[1:15:27] go up with us when you come over and
[1:15:29] join our church he said well i guess i
[1:15:31] might as well go into the association
[1:15:33] i imagine it's all right i'll be a
[1:15:35] little independent fellow up here maybe
[1:15:37] if i joined the association i'd be
[1:15:39] better off
[1:15:40] i'll have the fellowship then of israel
[1:15:43] down here and uh all these other fellows
[1:15:45] up in here maybe if i could just charm
[1:15:47] the association yeah sometimes you make
[1:15:49] a mistake but doing that
[1:15:51] yeah i got nothing against the
[1:15:52] association
[1:15:54] but just stay the way you are of god
[1:15:56] now the first thing you know he goes up
[1:15:58] there and after a while uh he said well
[1:16:01] you work with me to battle said sure
[1:16:04] we're all christians anyhow we're all
[1:16:06] believers anyhow that he wanted to be a
[1:16:09] mixer
[1:16:10] and that's what the world is looking for
[1:16:12] today is a mixer
[1:16:14] but god wants separators
[1:16:19] you know
[1:16:21] just some time ago i heard a church
[1:16:24] up in the northern part of indiana was
[1:16:26] making their choice for a pastor
[1:16:28] and a whole bunch of them
[1:16:31] almost 100 percent unanimously voted on
[1:16:34] a guy because of his looks
[1:16:37] great big fine looking young man
[1:16:40] and i asked an old grandmother
[1:16:43] i said how did you vote in that case i
[1:16:45] see him give the brother a bible that
[1:16:47] day when he brought him into the church
[1:16:50] and give him the privileges of either
[1:16:52] pastor
[1:16:53] i said oh she said he was such a
[1:16:56] handsome looking fellow
[1:16:58] i said but that's not all of it sister
[1:17:01] the thing of it is what does he preach
[1:17:05] what does he feed with
[1:17:07] does he feed with some kind of little
[1:17:08] recreation program does he talk about
[1:17:11] roses and flowers or who's going to be
[1:17:13] the next president or some baseball game
[1:17:15] or some fish fry or party or does he
[1:17:18] preach the word of god
[1:17:22] yes sir
[1:17:24] nice one young lady
[1:17:26] i said well what about you
[1:17:29] and she give me her excuse for it
[1:17:31] but look that's when people vote
[1:17:35] they vote by their sign one time there
[1:17:38] had to be a selection maybe would take
[1:17:39] saul's place
[1:17:41] down in israel
[1:17:43] and so saw with the head and shoulders
[1:17:45] above all his army so even the prophet
[1:17:48] got the heart of the world and went to
[1:17:50] jesus house to not one of his sons to be
[1:17:53] king the lord told him to
[1:17:55] but he said don't you not but who i
[1:17:57] called for
[1:17:59] and then they run out the great big
[1:18:01] oldest one there great big seven footer
[1:18:04] but why won't he look good standing the
[1:18:06] fulfillment with his clothes just
[1:18:08] fitting him just right and all about it
[1:18:10] that's what america wants to do
[1:18:12] pending costs here
[1:18:14] get ready
[1:18:16] pentecost is full of hollywood
[1:18:19] evangelism
[1:18:22] why in louisville kentucky a bunch of
[1:18:24] people coming there not long ago and i
[1:18:26] went over there to a revival center
[1:18:29] thought i'd get my soul all fed up and i
[1:18:31] got over there and a woman on a platform
[1:18:34] with great big earrings hanging down
[1:18:37] and with the clothes on look like she's
[1:18:39] been poured into them
[1:18:41] and run up down the aisle in hallelujah
[1:18:44] he'll give the next 50.
[1:18:46] and
[1:18:47] i never heard such and their music sound
[1:18:50] like some kind of
[1:18:52] rock and roll boogie woogie
[1:18:54] that's got its place but not on the
[1:18:57] platform
[1:18:58] amen
[1:19:00] i just almost i thought they're building
[1:19:02] my followings i went out
[1:19:05] to see people how far away
[1:19:10] don't think because your pentecostal
[1:19:12] god's going to take you in on that name
[1:19:13] you won't do it you've got to have the
[1:19:15] article brother
[1:19:17] right
[1:19:18] notice
[1:19:20] here you are joining himself up
[1:19:23] associating with unbelievers
[1:19:26] so they fixed them a compass for seven
[1:19:28] days and got out into the desert
[1:19:30] on out to fight the kings of moab and
[1:19:33] when they got out there they found out
[1:19:36] that they were out of water
[1:19:38] their water supply was cut off
[1:19:41] and things go wrong when the water's cut
[1:19:43] off do you know that
[1:19:46] now in the public utility if you don't
[1:19:48] pay the bill they'll cut the water on
[1:19:50] them you got up around the house and
[1:19:53] that's what's the matter with god's
[1:19:55] people tonight they just didn't pay the
[1:19:57] price and god's cut the water off that's
[1:19:59] right that's all
[1:20:02] get allowed in the desert go to any
[1:20:04] desert you want to that's the reason
[1:20:06] some of you full gospel church members
[1:20:08] and so forth don't believe in divine
[1:20:10] healing your water's been cut off
[1:20:14] out in the desert
[1:20:16] you say full gospel the dirtiest i ever
[1:20:18] was treated was by a pentecostal pastor
[1:20:22] against divine healing i asked him if i
[1:20:24] could rent some seats for him i had a
[1:20:26] big meeting in the city and because a
[1:20:28] certain church was sponsored he said
[1:20:30] anybody that about anything i wouldn't
[1:20:32] even let set on my seat
[1:20:34] that was pentecostal
[1:20:36] sure
[1:20:37] that's right but then a gun shot this
[1:20:39] and all wasn't worried you're setting
[1:20:40] nine
[1:20:41] that's right
[1:20:43] would be a little farther now i suppose
[1:20:45] we've got about 200 miles
[1:20:47] but
[1:20:48] look
[1:20:49] that would be the big cannon guns we're
[1:20:51] shooting today
[1:20:52] but notice
[1:20:54] that's what he said and he wouldn't let
[1:20:55] me have him and the people had to stand
[1:20:58] but we had the meeting just the same
[1:21:00] but i noticed
[1:21:02] that's the reason
[1:21:03] out of the desert everything you come in
[1:21:06] contact in the desert's got stickers on
[1:21:08] i don't care if it's a little leaf or
[1:21:10] whatever it is don't fool with it cause
[1:21:12] it's got a sticker on you know what does
[1:21:14] that is because it ain't end of water
[1:21:16] where there's no water against stickers
[1:21:19] where there's water that same plant will
[1:21:21] soften up and make leaves
[1:21:23] and that's what's the matter with the
[1:21:24] church really so much buttons i'm a
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:33] oh we don't believe in that we believe
[1:21:35] in dancing this way we believe in this
[1:21:37] should do this liberation of women or
[1:21:39] whether it's oh my what's the matter
[1:21:42] your water supply is cut off
[1:21:45] right
[1:21:49] so they found out they were without
[1:21:51] water and when you're without water
[1:21:53] without
[1:21:54] life then they said what can we do about
[1:21:58] it we're starting a prayer meeting it's
[1:22:00] a bad time to start a man
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:20] of the king of israel and said
[1:22:23] said why you know what we've got a man
[1:22:25] we've got down here by the name of
[1:22:26] elisha
[1:22:28] he poured water on elijah's hands in
[1:22:31] other words his association was pretty
[1:22:33] good
[1:22:34] he really had some dealings with the
[1:22:36] real prophet birth of a feather flocked
[1:22:39] together
[1:22:40] that's right
[1:22:42] how can you expect anybody to believe
[1:22:44] you when you're running around and
[1:22:45] acting the way you do and then come in
[1:22:47] and call yourself christians no wonder
[1:22:48] they don't call for income pray for them
[1:22:50] and so forth that's right
[1:22:53] now birds of a feather flocked together
[1:22:57] and it said well but this man poured
[1:22:59] water on his eyes and the tishbites they
[1:23:01] poured water on his hands he had some
[1:23:03] dealings with him
[1:23:07] being a spiritual man the first thing he
[1:23:09] thought of was to visit the prophet
[1:23:12] and when a real child of god ever gets
[1:23:14] in trouble the first thing he goes to is
[1:23:16] god
[1:23:17] right straight back to god yeah
[1:23:20] amen so let's go to him quickly
[1:23:23] somebody went down there and drove up
[1:23:24] brock elijah was in there reading the
[1:23:26] scriptures perhaps
[1:23:27] and when they all drove up in front of
[1:23:29] the kings
[1:23:30] well here they come in and he said what
[1:23:32] shall we do
[1:23:33] and elijah got his righteous incarnation
[1:23:36] all stirred up
[1:23:37] oh he could bore over once in a while
[1:23:41] he looked at old jerome standing there
[1:23:43] he said why don't you get to the prophet
[1:23:45] of your daddy and your mother why'd you
[1:23:47] come to me
[1:23:48] wow
[1:23:49] wasn't very peaceful was he
[1:23:51] why don't you go back to your pagan gods
[1:23:54] why'd you come down to me a prophet
[1:23:57] a servant of the lord a mighty man
[1:23:59] double portion of the spirit on me
[1:24:02] why don't you go to your mother's god
[1:24:04] and your father's god
[1:24:06] and listen to what he said
[1:24:07] if it wasn't that i respected the
[1:24:10] presence of jehoshaphat i wouldn't even
[1:24:13] look at you
[1:24:15] you talk about being stirred up
[1:24:18] and i believe that's the same thing
[1:24:19] tonight
[1:24:20] i believe this america will be blown to
[1:24:23] pieces
[1:24:24] i believe the thing has done been sunk
[1:24:27] in god if god didn't respect the real
[1:24:30] genuine christians in america that's
[1:24:32] praying to hold it together
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:36] i believe it had been gone long ago
[1:24:39] i believe the jacks would have took it
[1:24:41] or some other nation if god hadn't
[1:24:43] respected the honest sincere prayers of
[1:24:47] born again children of god
[1:24:50] that if i didn't respect the presence of
[1:24:52] that righteous man i wouldn't even look
[1:24:55] at you so he got himself all stirred up
[1:24:57] so you know when you get all stirred up
[1:24:59] and round up like that it's not a good
[1:25:02] time to do any service for the lord so
[1:25:04] you know what he said
[1:25:05] said nevertheless go get me a menstrual
[1:25:08] start praying plan
[1:25:10] now you people who don't believe in
[1:25:11] music in the church what about that
[1:25:15] yeah say go get me a miserable i'm all
[1:25:18] round up today my righteous dignity is
[1:25:20] born over
[1:25:21] that guy come up here that borderline
[1:25:23] preacher stand up here leading them
[1:25:25] children wrong down there and doing that
[1:25:28] take a hold of him
[1:25:30] bro i gotta see a vision now so bring me
[1:25:32] an israel and then when you got all
[1:25:35] the music and they got the play in the
[1:25:37] music some real good hymn and the first
[1:25:40] thing you know when the songs return to
[1:25:43] zion
[1:25:44] when the music and the children begin to
[1:25:46] sing from their heart
[1:25:48] something takes place
[1:25:50] the spirit of the lord tell the prophet
[1:25:53] at the real old-fashioned godly sin
[1:25:57] and repenting
[1:25:59] will bring the spirit of god on the
[1:26:02] prophet then he'll do the same thing
[1:26:04] today
[1:26:06] and notice he wanted to see the way out
[1:26:09] and the only way out they could do would
[1:26:10] be he had a revival
[1:26:13] so he had some repented sinners that
[1:26:16] come in and the music played and the
[1:26:19] prophets saw an engine
[1:26:21] and the only way you're ever going to
[1:26:23] see your way out is an old-fashioned
[1:26:25] spiritual revival where the hallelujahs
[1:26:28] of god is ringing from the bottom of
[1:26:30] their heart have an old passion holy
[1:26:32] ghost sent revival typically
[1:26:35] then you begin to see things
[1:26:37] then god will be able to reveal things
[1:26:40] then you wonder why these real
[1:26:41] christians are hanging on while they're
[1:26:43] praying for you
[1:26:46] what a revival any god in the spirit
[1:26:49] now the reason that these people have
[1:26:51] dances is they can have a dance let's
[1:26:53] get the spear down
[1:26:55] you can't have a ball game unless you
[1:26:56] get the spirit of a ball game
[1:26:59] you've got to get in the spirit of it
[1:27:00] and we can never have a revival
[1:27:02] shreveport reporter anywhere else until
[1:27:05] the church gets in the spirit of revival
[1:27:09] god can come and perform miracles he can
[1:27:12] show wonder he can stretch forth his
[1:27:14] hand and he was sick and afflicted the
[1:27:16] preacher can preach the gospel as hard
[1:27:18] as he can but there will never be a
[1:27:20] revival until the church gets in the
[1:27:23] spirit of revival
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:27] amen america's going to sleep
[1:27:31] times thousands of great miracles and
[1:27:34] signs and wonders and events with
[1:27:37] students hearts are burning
[1:27:40] man and audience got to make decisions

[1:27:44] borderline

[1:27:47] are turning to god and receiving the
[1:27:49] holy ghost

[1:28:51] showdown pretty soon or what he's going
[1:28:52] to do about it but he made the remarks

[1:29:58] baptist the holy ghost they're stepping
[1:29:59] in and grabbing it like that is better
[1:30:00] than the camp

[1:30:12] going to make me right now
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:15] now
[1:30:16] he said now i saw a vision i see the way
[1:30:20] out
[1:30:21] i know what to do
[1:30:23] and i'll tell you whether today the
[1:30:25] church hasn't got the vision
[1:30:27] or they have more prayer to be more
[1:30:30] spiritually what they are
[1:30:32] unless there is a vision
[1:30:34] unless someone can see the vision
[1:30:37] see the coming of the lord seeing the
[1:30:39] things that we're going through and see
[1:30:40] all these things that god predicted that
[1:30:42] would be in the last days and here we
[1:30:45] are
[1:30:47] instead of reading the bible we're
[1:30:49] reading love stories considering that we
[1:30:51] read everything else we already reading
[1:30:53] god's vibe and our knees constantly
[1:30:55] praying for god to help us
[1:30:57] awakening our soul or crying out
[1:31:00] to the lord
[1:31:02] but we don't
[1:31:03] now notice
[1:31:05] and then when he said he see you have a
[1:31:07] way out i said the first thing i want
[1:31:09] you to do is go out here and make this
[1:31:12] valley full of dishes
[1:31:14] dig just as hard as you can
[1:31:16] for thus saith the lord
[1:31:18] you'll not see any wind or there'll be
[1:31:21] any rain
[1:31:22] but this valley will be full of water
[1:31:25] more ditches of more water
[1:31:28] what did he see he saw a vision of that
[1:31:31] spiritual rock that moses had already
[1:31:34] smitten and been speaking to he had just
[1:31:36] spoke to that rock and it was ready to
[1:31:38] pour forth the water when ditches was
[1:31:41] made fortunate
[1:31:43] and i'll say that same smitten rock
[1:31:45] tonight is here
[1:31:47] and it'll pour forth an old-fashioned
[1:31:50] holy ghost revival that'll cherish
[1:31:52] report apart
[1:31:53] if your people are going to dig in
[1:31:57] moving all the difficult times
[1:31:59] if you dig up against one thing a beer
[1:32:02] cans enough in the ice box throw it up
[1:32:05] make way for the holy ghost
[1:32:07] every time you hit against the snake
[1:32:09] throw the thing out the thing for you
[1:32:11] take the little water you get
[1:32:14] but what you have to have is to make a
[1:32:15] way for it
[1:32:17] no matter how much preaching there is
[1:32:19] how many visions they are the subject
[1:32:22] was saying and the main principle was
[1:32:23] make ready for the water get the ditches
[1:32:27] dug that's what we got to do tonight is
[1:32:29] to make way for the holy ghost to pull
[1:32:32] down make it into your house make it in
[1:32:34] your turn make it yourself take
[1:32:36] everything out of the way
[1:32:37] get ready
[1:32:39] there's cunning adventure
[1:32:41] if you make ready for
[1:32:43] if you don't make ready for it you'll
[1:32:45] never see it
[1:32:46] that's up to the church tonight
[1:32:49] got a nice tip here
[1:32:51] you got a nice view of church in the
[1:32:53] seats
[1:32:54] got nice people got nice singing
[1:32:57] we got a wonderful savior
[1:33:00] but get everything outside everything
[1:33:02] every sin that's the eastern is touching
[1:33:04] brother i don't do nothing maybe that's
[1:33:06] what's the matter
[1:33:08] that's a trouble amen there's more sin
[1:33:11] not to do what it is to do when you know
[1:33:13] better
[1:33:14] right either
[1:33:15] good news or not the human sin
[1:33:18] you've got to make ready
[1:33:21] doing nothing is the worst thing you can
[1:33:22] do
[1:33:24] do nothing about it
[1:33:26] your southerners remember your history
[1:33:28] went up here when grant was sent just
[1:33:30] across the river
[1:33:31] and he had a boy out there on guard duty
[1:33:35] and the rebels was across the river
[1:33:37] and this boy walking along there kind of
[1:33:39] dazed around with the dreams of his
[1:33:41] sweetheart
[1:33:42] he left his post of duty and went on to
[1:33:44] pick some violence
[1:33:46] just saying to his sweetheart
[1:33:48] he didn't mean to do wrong

[1:34:11] into the state
[1:34:12] and that boy was shot an hour later
[1:34:15] not because he if they didn't have no
[1:34:18] objection to him thinking about it
[1:34:20] they didn't it wasn't what he'd done it
[1:34:22] was the things he didn't do
[1:34:24] he didn't stand to his post of duty
[1:34:27] he didn't guard the post like he was

[1:34:37] and churches in shreveport louisiana
[1:34:40] god is sheriff take it with a storm
[1:34:45] it ain't what you're doing there is what
[1:34:46] you're failing to do
[1:34:48] let's do something about it
[1:34:50] let's dig with all of our hearts that
[1:34:52] when that day of judgment comes we can
[1:34:54] say god i did the very best i could and
[1:34:57] you know i did it
[1:34:59] amen
[1:35:01] we do all we can do
[1:35:02] that's always expected
[1:35:04] notice
[1:35:05] when they begin to dig
[1:35:07] they dug down against things just sorted
[1:35:09] out many big ditches the next morning
[1:35:11] the enemy looked down the sun come up
[1:35:13] and looked like blood they said well
[1:35:15] they fought among one another and killed
[1:35:16] each other and away they went in and
[1:35:18] they were ambushed
[1:35:19] and he said this is just the light thing
[1:35:21] before the lord
[1:35:22] sending forth his water and then went
[1:35:24] over into the other land and they
[1:35:26] stopped up everywhere else they cut out
[1:35:28] every good tree
[1:35:30] they just had our real old-fashioned
[1:35:32] revival and when it gets to the place
[1:35:34] that the people that love god will throw
[1:35:36] everything they got right into the
[1:35:38] revival with prayer and with everything
[1:35:40] else and seek god's faith and pray and
[1:35:43] and seek god and call out in the hours
[1:35:45] of night for mercy and get the neighbors
[1:35:47] saved and so forth i'll tell you we'll
[1:35:50] stop the mouth of every critic
[1:35:53] we'll knock down every horrible thing is
[1:35:55] standing up
[1:35:56] and they'll have to know that god's been
[1:35:58] in the camp
[1:35:59] that's right
[1:36:01] friends we'll never do it until that
[1:36:03] thing takes place
[1:36:05] we can
[1:36:06] that's so reliable for us saith the lord
[1:36:09] to the lion
[1:36:10] spoke in the name of the lord and the
[1:36:13] other night
[1:36:14] when i was coming over here a few nights
[1:36:15] ago and the lord met me in the room that
[1:36:18] justice vision is same as the sea at the
[1:36:20] platform other places said yes what's
[1:36:23] the matter with the church they've got
[1:36:25] so much selfishness everywhere didn't
[1:36:27] you say this the church of the living
[1:36:29] god has got so much differences and so
[1:36:32] much this and that so they breathe the
[1:36:34] holy spirit away from them
[1:36:36] and that's just exactly what it is and
[1:36:39] brother sister until we humble ourselves
[1:36:42] and become the lamb so the dove can
[1:36:44] light on us again and bring joy and
[1:36:46] peace and satisfaction and a burning
[1:36:49] desire in our hearts to see others saved
[1:36:51] and come to god we are simply fighting
[1:36:54] the winds
[1:36:55] that's all
[1:36:56] that is true
[1:36:58] no matter how many revivals the lord
[1:37:00] jesus was standing here at the platform
[1:37:02] last night and prove to every person
[1:37:05] present that he would absolutely raise
[1:37:08] from there
[1:37:11] let us shut it down
[1:37:13] tonight
[1:37:15] two or three hundred less people than we
[1:37:17] shared last night
[1:37:18] what's the matter the end time is your
[1:37:21] brother that's right it's here that's
[1:37:23] right we on any shadow down that same
[1:37:26] action and germany switzerland africa
[1:37:30] anywhere in the other land
[1:37:32] that same thing with her place
[1:37:34] there's been a hundred thousand people
[1:37:36] there that have been at least twenty or
[1:37:37] thirty thousand come to christ
[1:37:39] and the next night they've been double
[1:37:41] at that's right what is it
[1:37:43] the holy spirit has flew away from us
[1:37:46] and she's gone overseas
[1:37:48] hunting lambs to dwell in
[1:37:51] that's really exactly what's taking
[1:37:53] place
[1:37:54] what a time
[1:37:55] what a tragedy
[1:37:57] to see that we the more the church
[1:38:00] preaches the more the saints cry out it
[1:38:03] seems like the farther away from god the
[1:38:05] nation gets
[1:38:06] no wonder airplanes are crashing in the
[1:38:09] air boats are crashing on the sea the
[1:38:11] bible is said to be perplexed of time
[1:38:13] distress between the nations greatest
[1:38:15] times flying saucers through the air
[1:38:18] sights the heavens above and on earth
[1:38:19] below all these things taking place but
[1:38:22] the gospel would be preached
[1:38:25] and he said there would come a famine in
[1:38:28] the land not for bread and
[1:38:30] water but for the hearing of the word of
[1:38:33] god the true word of god
[1:38:35] a famine
[1:38:37] oh what a day that we're living in
[1:38:39] we ought to be
[1:38:41] ready make it ready now what are you
[1:38:43] speaking to brother brandon are you
[1:38:45] saying that to me i am saying that to
[1:38:48] you if you are unsafe
[1:38:50] if you have never received crowns
[1:38:52] if you don't know what it is to be
[1:38:54] filled with the holy spirit i'm speaking
[1:38:56] to you
[1:38:57] if you're a born again christian pray it
[1:38:59] up doing everything that you can just
[1:39:01] remember you can say hallelujah to him
[1:39:04] one night without preaching i thought
[1:39:06] i'd condemn sin in every way that i
[1:39:08] could condemn it in i combed it over and
[1:39:10] over until i wondered if a congregation
[1:39:12] ever come back
[1:39:14] and i don't mind sure that's covered
[1:39:16] everything god when i meet you there i
[1:39:18] can say i told him the truth
[1:39:20] and as i went away there's a lady a
[1:39:22] little flippy like walked up to me and
[1:39:24] she said well preacher you never struck
[1:39:25] me tonight
[1:39:27] that's one thing not one thing you said
[1:39:29] ever bothered me i'm above everything
[1:39:32] well i thought that lady was in pretty
[1:39:34] good shape she went flipping all the way
[1:39:36] like that struck him down long down
[1:39:38] i said well praise the lord i'm sure
[1:39:40] glad that
[1:39:41] she went on out some elderly ladies just
[1:39:43] tell her i said
[1:39:45] uh the universe said sure
[1:39:47] such as the biggest gospel there isn't
[1:39:48] you're so thinking about god
[1:39:50] there you are
[1:39:52] see
[1:39:55] oh my but remember
[1:39:57] brother no matter what it is what we'll
[1:40:01] see there is lay it aside
[1:40:04] if i haven't struck it may the holy
[1:40:06] spirit strike it to your heart tonight
[1:40:09] maybe it's unbelief maybe it's doubt you
[1:40:11] may be skeptic
[1:40:13] if it is make god lay it to your heart
[1:40:15] and we have an old-fashioned revival
[1:40:17] coming up this coming week may the lord
[1:40:20] grant it as we've got our heads go ask
[1:40:22] the little sister she'll come to this
[1:40:24] piano
[1:40:25] at oregon whatever and give us just a
[1:40:28] card if you will since you're there
[1:40:30] while i ask for this altar call now it's
[1:40:33] early yet tonight
[1:40:35] and i want to know as you have your
[1:40:36] heads down i offer this word of prayer
[1:40:39] for everyone i heavenly father
[1:40:43] harshly have i condemned sin
[1:40:46] and ever a way to call my mind i'll let
[1:40:49] it go through this microphone
[1:40:51] everything that i thought of but you put
[1:40:53] my mind i set it right out
[1:40:57] it might have offended some but at the
[1:40:59] day of the judgment i can say i'm
[1:41:01] innocent
[1:41:02] i preached the word just as you gave it
[1:41:05] yes
[1:41:06] and now there's no doubt there's just
[1:41:08] many fine loving people sitting here
[1:41:10] prayed up filled with the holy spirit no
[1:41:12] condemnation in their heart living
[1:41:15] daily before the lord if he should call
[1:41:17] them they be ready to go
[1:41:20] but to do my part to preach the gospel
[1:41:24] they'll call the colors of the gospel
[1:41:26] to show what christ died for what it is
[1:41:29] when it comes to us
[1:41:31] then lord jesus said there's somebody
[1:41:32] sitting here under condemnation you're
[1:41:34] the judge
[1:41:37] the word is gone forth it's the judge
[1:41:40] and you are the word
[1:41:42] now the father is someone who is living
[1:41:44] just right and though that you would
[1:41:47] send jesus to the earth tonight they've
[1:41:49] been condemned and loved
[1:41:51] and i think it's strange he's hanging
[1:41:53] out with his tent in hot weather to
[1:41:55] preach the old fashioned
[1:41:57] rough
[1:41:58] sin killing stirring
[1:42:02] no no gloves on
[1:42:04] handling it bare-handed laying it right
[1:42:06] out where it belongs
[1:42:10] lord my heart is open
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:20] lord my heart
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:40] lord my heart
[1:42:43] is
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:43:06] i've opened
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:21] come inside
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:34] lord my heart is
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:44:00] i opened
[1:44:14] come inside
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:27] sometimes i think it's good to hear a
[1:44:29] message like that
[1:44:31] to check ourselves closely
[1:44:34] sometimes we can just get caught up with
[1:44:36] emotions and we're doing all right
[1:44:38] everything's good
[1:44:40] but just to check closely lord is
[1:44:42] everything all right
[1:44:43] is everything okay between me and you
[1:44:46] [Music]
[1:44:47] it's life gets busy
[1:44:50] things go on next thing you know the
[1:44:52] day's gone by and
[1:44:54] i didn't have much time to even talk to
[1:44:56] the lord today
[1:44:58] but without him where would we be today
[1:45:00] without you know even this morning as i
[1:45:03] was driving up got ready to go to work i
[1:45:05] just said lord let my mind and my heart
[1:45:07] just stay
[1:45:09] on you as much as possible during the
[1:45:11] day
[1:45:12] i know where it gets busy and you got to
[1:45:13] concentrate on work
[1:45:16] but just as quick as you can hate lord
[1:45:18] you know i just want to stay that way
[1:45:21] i just
[1:45:24] it's it's easy to get caught up on
[1:45:26] everything else that's going around
[1:45:28] even brother branham says not all of it
[1:45:30] is wrong but you get caught up in it
[1:45:31] before you know it
[1:45:33] you haven't even talked to the lord
[1:45:35] but lord keep my heart let my heart be
[1:45:37] open
[1:45:38] and let you dwell inside
[1:45:40] and let you come and and you know
[1:45:44] you you make the valley full of ditches
[1:45:46] in your life
[1:45:48] because god said if you'll you'll allow
[1:45:50] when you do it i will pour out i will
[1:45:52] give
[1:45:54] how much of god in you is in you well
[1:45:55] how much have you let of god be in you
[1:45:58] and there it is because
[1:46:00] brother green always reminded of god
[1:46:02] wants to give you the holy ghost more
[1:46:05] than you even want and you say lord i
[1:46:06] want it
[1:46:08] make room for it
[1:46:10] let's pray lord we
[1:46:14] sometimes we say lord we're way beyond
[1:46:16] that where we we need the deeper
[1:46:18] mysteries we need the greater
[1:46:19] revelations but sometimes we just need
[1:46:21] to be reminded
[1:46:22] make sure that our steps and our
[1:46:25] footing is grounded lord in your
[1:46:27] presence in the holy spirit lord in your
[1:46:29] word
[1:46:30] father so that we're anchored in the
[1:46:32] time of trouble in a day like we've
[1:46:34] never seen before
[1:46:36] and that we're anchored and we know that
[1:46:38] our anchor holds lord because we're
[1:46:40] grounded in you lord
[1:46:43] father may we take this word and apply
[1:46:45] it to our own lives each one of us lord
[1:46:48] shame lord make me more like you
[1:46:51] and lord as as we just let you have
[1:46:53] preeminence in our lives lord
[1:46:55] do the things that please you lord and
[1:46:57] we'll find
[1:47:00] that we'll find lord we'd think well i'm
[1:47:02] not going to be able no you're going to
[1:47:03] lose a desire to do those things rather
[1:47:06] that that occupy so much your time and
[1:47:08] you would find yourself serving the lord
[1:47:10] and just having a closer relationship
[1:47:12] lord let it be that way for all of us
[1:47:14] lord
[1:47:16] as we've heard your word today lord
