[36:52] tonight brother Jerry I believe that we
[36:54] have met before
[36:57] before I saw you I saw you on the video
[37:00] praying and and I I've met you before
[37:03] and I can't remember exactly where but
[37:05] but brother it's good to have you than
[37:07] thank you for joining us tonight what we
[37:10] have tonight what we've been doing
[37:14] really over the past year is we've been
[37:17] just digging into the scriptures and
[37:21] usually on Wednesday night we started a
[37:23] Bible study and we started it with book
[37:25] of Acts and we went through chapter by
[37:27] chapter line by line and we read every
[37:31] single word in the book of Acts and and
[37:35] we learned what was going on there and I
[37:37] felt it upon my heart to start in the
[37:41] book of Genesis and let's just go
[37:43] through the whole
[37:44] Bible and the plan is to give just an
[37:48] overview of each book so that we can
[37:53] know what this Bible says what it's
[37:55] about we won't w't be able to dig in
[37:57] very deep uh like we did the book of
[37:59] Acts but we want to know
[38:02] every what what's in each book and we
[38:08] started with Genesis we split Genesis
[38:10] into two the plan is to get through with
[38:13] the Old Testament by this time next year
[38:16] but I believe it was it was either
[38:18] Dwight Eisenhower or Winston Churchill
[38:21] one of those great generals one of those
[38:23] great leaders he said that you
[38:28] plan and when you finally get to the
[38:32] battle he said the plan is
[38:35] worthless he said but the planning is
[38:39] priceless and that's how I feel with
[38:43] with the church and and with what we're
[38:45] doing is I'm always willing to change
[38:49] directions and I want to I want to plan
[38:54] well I want to pray and and praying
[38:56] about about which direction to go and
[38:59] and studying and the planning will be
[39:03] Priceless no matter what but the plan we
[39:06] can always deviate and I'm always ready
[39:08] if the Lord leads a different way I'm
[39:10] always ready ready to change so we
[39:13] started brother Lyall and I split
[39:16] Genesis up into into two um two
[39:20] different Services then brother Lyle had
[39:23] Exodus and I'll tell you the Bible is is
[39:26] a very very exciting book and you get to
[39:32] the you you start in the book of Genesis
[39:33] and and wow it's a great book to start
[39:36] with because you start in God creates
[39:40] the Heaven and the Earth and then you
[39:41] see the Holy Spirit Come on the scene
[39:44] right at the beginning and it moves
[39:45] across the face of the
[39:47] deep and we see that each day God
[39:50] creates the different things and and and
[39:53] how he separates the light from the
[39:55] darkness and and he just builds this
[39:57] beautiful place called the Earth and
[40:00] this especially beautiful place called
[40:02] Eden and he sets his son there and his
[40:05] son is naming all of the animals and
[40:07] then and then he sees that his son is
[40:09] alone and he wants to provide him with
[40:11] with a helpmate and he gives him a wife
[40:13] and then we see that this mysterious
[40:16] creature comes in and and it's the
[40:18] serpent and and the book just keeps
[40:20] getting more exciting and we see time go
[40:23] on we see that first sacrifice there in
[40:25] the Garden of Eden when God killed
[40:29] this animal and made skins for them to
[40:32] cover themselves and we see as time goes
[40:35] on we see they're building cities and
[40:37] then we see the the ark we this man
[40:39] named Noah this Prophet goes and he
[40:41] builts builds this giant Ark and he
[40:43] brings all the animals in and and the
[40:45] animals are saved and then they they get
[40:47] out and then this this man named
[40:50] Abraham comes along the seene and God
[40:53] promises him he doesn't have any
[40:54] children God promises you're going to
[40:55] have children
[40:57] children and you're going to have more
[40:59] children look up at the stars there's
[41:01] going to be as many children as the
[41:03] stars of the sky or as the sand of the
[41:05] sea and he was he and his wife were both
[41:07] Barren so we see this amazing thing and
[41:10] we see that he has these two sons and he
[41:12] goes and he he wants to he's following
[41:15] God's orders he's going to kill one and
[41:16] it just builds and builds and builds and
[41:20] we see the 12 Patriarchs come and we see
[41:22] the last one Joseph come and then
[41:24] there's 400 years of Gap and then we see
[41:27] Exodus
[41:28] start and it is just as exciting we see
[41:32] a little boy and we see how this little
[41:35] boy is is they're killing all the babies
[41:38] and in put in this Nile and there's
[41:40] crocodiles and and there's all kinds of
[41:43] things going on and the pharaoh's sister
[41:45] takes him out of the out of there and
[41:47] raises him at his as his own as her own
[41:50] and he becomes almost to where he
[41:52] becomes king and then he sacrifices it
[41:55] all for his own people what a hero and
[41:58] he goes into exile for 40
[42:01] years and then God talks to him in this
[42:04] Burning
[42:05] Bush and he comes back and delivers the
[42:12] people and man there's plagues and
[42:15] there's there's all kinds of things
[42:18] going on and and he brings the people
[42:20] out of slavery and they go to this big
[42:23] ocean in the water parts and they go
[42:25] across and then they're hungry and God
[42:28] Reigns mana and then there's a pillar of
[42:29] fire show up and a pillar of cloud and
[42:32] then they build this Tabernacle and and
[42:34] then and then it all ends it's so
[42:36] exciting and then we get to the Book of
[42:39] Leviticus it's like
[42:42] what what is
[42:44] this very different
[42:48] book I
[42:49] remember I was on the the last time I
[42:52] think I believe it was the eighth time
[42:55] and it's the last time I read my Bible
[42:56] all the way
[42:58] through and I
[43:00] got same thing I was just loving Genesis
[43:03] loving Exodus and I finished Exodus and
[43:06] I got to Leviticus and I said Lord I've
[43:09] read this book seven
[43:12] times and I said I always get to this
[43:18] book and I just read it to get through
[43:22] it and I I said Lord would you give me
[43:28] something would you help me
[43:32] to want to read this would you show me
[43:36] something so I'm excited to read this
[43:39] book and God answered my
[43:41] prayers and I
[43:43] started in the Book of
[43:47] Leviticus and it became an incredible
[43:51] incredible book to me it
[43:54] was it was uh
[43:58] what I saw and what is so
[44:01] incredible about this
[44:04] book and this is what the Lord revealed
[44:07] to me and what made it so
[44:09] wonderful is from the
[44:12] start to the
[44:14] finish the Lord showed us Jesus Christ
[44:19] in the whole book I believe more than
[44:22] any other book in the whole Bible
[44:27] especially in the Old Testament we see
[44:30] Christ described in detail it
[44:36] metaphorically through through rituals
[44:39] and through customs and and through
[44:41] sacrifices and feast days it's all about
[44:46] Jesus and I got to tell you I
[44:50] Lov this book and then I got to the
[44:53] end I was like oh man it's
[44:57] over that was
[45:00] great so in getting into this book I
[45:05] think the key is that we understand the
[45:08] reason that it was
[45:11] written now it happens in just a a short
[45:14] period of time but the ly
[45:17] ended and we're at Mount
[45:21] Si with all of the Hebrews that had come
[45:24] out of Egypt
[45:26] and they're camped there at this
[45:28] mountain Moses goes up and he gets this
[45:32] thing called the law Ten
[45:35] Commandments he comes back down they
[45:38] they had they built
[45:41] this Tabernacle in the
[45:44] wilderness and they Moses had these
[45:48] stones and they they had built this
[45:49] thing called The Ark which is this
[45:53] box and they they they bring it in there
[45:57] and then the book
[46:00] ends right there and they're right here
[46:03] at the foot of this mountain for about
[46:05] 11 and a half
[46:07] months and this law that was started
[46:10] with the Ten
[46:11] Commandments The Book of
[46:14] Leviticus is all
[46:18] about all about the law and it's all
[46:23] about explaining to the people people
[46:26] how they can get closer to God so the
[46:29] question in this book the main question
[46:32] as we're going through Leviticus is how
[46:35] do we enter into the presence of
[46:39] God we had the sermon this morning about
[46:43] how the rich man was in
[46:45] hell and there was a gulf between
[46:50] him and God over here in
[46:54] Abraham and that that Gulf that Gulf
[46:58] couldn't be crossed that Gulf was
[47:01] sin and This Book of Leviticus IT
[47:03] addresses the
[47:07] sin and then this
[47:11] God if God is
[47:14] Holy then the space around him is Holy
[47:20] and to enter into that
[47:22] space we need to live a holy life and
[47:26] that is what the Book of Leviticus is
[47:29] about and how do we enter into the
[47:31] presence of God God is to use a metaphor
[47:35] here God's kind of like the
[47:38] sun if
[47:40] you get to close to him you're going to
[47:44] burn up you can't get too close to him
[47:47] physically but if you get too far away
[47:50] from him then you're going to freeze to
[47:53] death so what this book is doing this
[47:56] book is showing us how to get in his
[47:59] presence showing the Hebrews how to get
[48:01] in his presence and stay in that area
[48:04] and you're going to see what happens if
[48:07] you get too close to him and you're
[48:08] certainly going to see what happens if
[48:10] you get too far from him and then you're
[48:12] going to see what happens if you
[48:15] disrespect
[48:16] him and it's
[48:18] every when we get too far away from him
[48:21] it's that coldness that we get and it's
[48:24] be we become worldly
[48:27] it's like everyday life and we just go
[48:29] through the
[48:30] motions and the world Creeps in and all
[48:33] of a sudden we find that we are far far
[48:37] away from
[48:38] God and
[48:40] Leviticus is
[48:42] written to keep us to keep the Hebrews
[48:46] close remember they're at the bottom
[48:48] they're at the foot of Mount Si
[48:50] there
[48:52] now as far as getting too close to God
[48:55] it's like well brother Daniel what are
[48:57] you talking about we want to get as
[48:58] close to God as we can and that's true
[49:01] but there's a story in the Bible about
[49:04] Moses and Moses in the book of Exodus
[49:07] Moses had a desire to see God you
[49:09] remember the story and God said stand up
[49:12] here on a
[49:13] rock God agrees Moses wants to see the
[49:17] glory wants to see God and God tells him
[49:19] listen you can't see me and he says
[49:23] these words he says
[49:26] that if any man sees me no man can see
[49:30] me and
[49:32] live so he says but you can see my
[49:36] glory so Moses stands on the Rock and
[49:38] the glory of the Lord passes and Moses
[49:41] catches a glimpse of his back but even
[49:45] Moses the prophet he couldn't look God
[49:48] right in the face because it wasn't
[49:50] possible for the human flesh to have
[49:52] that or you would
[49:54] die it's strange I know I don't
[49:57] understand it it's but it's it's the way
[50:01] that that God
[50:03] is and it's the same like with looking
[50:06] at the sun we can look at the Sun and we
[50:09] can go
[50:10] blind but we can every day enjoy the
[50:15] benefits of the sun enjoy its warmth
[50:18] enjoy its light but we don't want to
[50:21] take it too far and just stare at the
[50:24] sun because it will hurt
[50:27] us basically This Book of Leviticus is
[50:30] meant to bring the Hebrews Hebrews into
[50:34] fellowship with God now as you read it
[50:38] and I encourage the congregation is
[50:41] always to read your Bible and read this
[50:43] book you will see this word that keeps
[50:47] repeating itself and it's called
[50:49] holy holy just means to be set
[50:53] apart God is set set apart and if God is
[50:57] Holy then the space around God is Holy
[51:01] so if Israel wanted to live in the
[51:03] presence of God then they needed to be
[51:05] holy like God is
[51:07] Holy the beginning of the
[51:09] book and the end of the book are
[51:12] descriptions of the ordinances and the
[51:14] rituals that they need to practice and
[51:17] in the middle of the book it's about the
[51:19] priests and how they need to be
[51:21] especially holy because they are to be
[51:24] mediators
[51:26] between God and the
[51:29] people there's five main types of
[51:32] sacrifices in The Book of Leviticus two
[51:35] of those sacrifices were meant for
[51:37] gratitude for God's blessings they're
[51:39] not
[51:41] required but they were given by the
[51:44] people to God then three of those
[51:47] sacrifices of those five main sacrifices
[51:49] were designed for repentance basically
[51:52] for saying sorry for what they have have
[51:54] done
[51:56] here the Jew would offer an animal while
[51:59] confessing that the sacrifice is in the
[52:02] place of their sin now remember this is
[52:05] 1500 years before Christ but every
[52:09] sacrifice for atonement that word
[52:11] atonement will keep coming up that word
[52:14] atonement is a very important word and
[52:16] it basically just means compensation
[52:18] just
[52:20] payment but the atonement is that animal
[52:23] taking the place of The Sinner and and
[52:25] then God's Wrath is stayed and the
[52:27] ultimate goal in the sacrifice is to be
[52:30] G be forgiven for these
[52:33] sins so that's what this book is about
[52:36] and through these rituals also the
[52:38] congregation is constantly being
[52:40] reminded of the goodness and the mercy
[52:42] of God and then the next set of rituals
[52:45] that the that the book goes through is
[52:48] our seven annual feasts and these each
[52:51] of these feasts retell a
[52:53] story about how God God brought them out
[52:55] of slavery I just talked about Exodus
[52:58] how God brought them out of slavery and
[53:00] then brought them into the Wilderness on
[53:01] the way to the promised land and by
[53:03] retelling the story it reminds the
[53:08] people about the goodness of God and
[53:11] they have what's what's called these
[53:14] feast days and they're basically like
[53:16] holidays and they tell the
[53:19] story of of the goodness of God and how
[53:22] much he has protected him we just went
[53:24] through
[53:25] a um a holiday called Thanksgiving now
[53:28] Thanksgiving is when we look back or we
[53:31] should we look
[53:33] back when the pilgrims came over and
[53:37] then they finally um they lost half
[53:40] their people and they finally were were
[53:42] helped by the Indians and then they had
[53:45] a feast and the Thanksgiving story tells
[53:48] that story and this is these feast days
[53:50] are kind of like that they're meant to
[53:54] retail
[53:56] and to
[53:58] remember what God has done for the
[54:00] people Leviticus chapter 1 we'll start
[54:05] with verse one and we'll just we'll read
[54:07] a couple places in Leviticus to kind of
[54:09] give you a feeling of the book Leviticus
[54:12] 1:1 says this and the Lord called unto
[54:14] Moses and spake unto him out of the
[54:16] Tabernacle of the congregation now the
[54:20] Tabernacle of the congregation you've
[54:23] seen brother Lyall has put some some
[54:25] pictures up of the Tabernacle it's
[54:27] basically there's there there was a
[54:30] courtyard around a fence there was a an
[54:33] altar a bronze altar um for the burnt
[54:37] offerings that's in the Middle where
[54:39] where they make animal sacrifices and
[54:41] then there was a basin to to do the
[54:43] ceremonial washing and then there was a
[54:46] 15 about a 15 by 45t structure that um
[54:51] was was this tent and it was it was
[54:54] movable
[54:56] it was uh it was meant to be able to to
[54:59] fold up and then take to the next place
[55:02] because they were out in the wilderness
[55:04] and then in the inner area there was
[55:07] about a 15 by 30 foot
[55:10] chamber and that was the place that
[55:12] contained the shoe bread and and uh the
[55:15] the ordinances there and then there was
[55:17] a small 15 about 15x 15ft chamber which
[55:21] was the most holy place and that was
[55:23] where the ark was
[55:26] and then there was the ark and and um
[55:29] they had a there was a mercy seat and
[55:31] inside was Aaron's rod and uh the
[55:35] tablets of stone and and a a bowl of
[55:37] Mana that were in there so that's what
[55:41] when that first scripture God is
[55:45] speaking
[55:46] out from this
[55:49] place and he says speak unto the
[55:52] children of Israel and say unto them if
[55:54] any man
[55:55] man of you bring an offering unto the
[55:58] Lord you shall bring your offering of
[56:00] the cattle even of the herd and of the
[56:02] flock if his offering be a burnt
[56:05] sacrifice of the herd let him offer a
[56:08] male without
[56:10] blemish he shall offer it of his own
[56:12] voluntary will at the door of the
[56:14] Tabernacle of the congregation before
[56:16] the Lord and he shall put his
[56:20] hand on the
[56:23] head of the burnt offering
[56:25] and it shall be accepted for him to make
[56:28] an atonement for him so this man is
[56:32] putting his hand on the head of this
[56:34] burnt offering obviously it's not burnt
[56:36] yet it's still it's still alive and
[56:41] symbolically passing his sins onto that
[56:45] animal and he shall kill the bulock
[56:47] before the Lord and the priests Aaron's
[56:50] sons shall bring the blood and sprinkle
[56:52] the blood round about upon the altar
[56:55] that is by the door of the Tabernacle
[56:57] with the congregation now we have an
[56:58] image of our mind in our mind of the
[57:02] Tabernacle and the Wilderness but many
[57:04] times this was a very bloody place it
[57:07] was a place that had had taken they
[57:09] taken animals and cut their throats
[57:12] cutting up the animals and and it must
[57:15] have been at certain times there's
[57:17] probably just blood
[57:18] everywhere rough a rough place and then
[57:22] they would cook
[57:25] parts of these
[57:28] animals and what was amazing to me is
[57:31] I've
[57:32] always read through my Bible and and
[57:34] we've heard the term a sweet smelling
[57:36] Savor to the Lord and the incense coming
[57:40] up from the altar of the Lord and I
[57:43] always thought boy it's it's probably
[57:45] like frankincense and myrr and some sort
[57:47] of Flowery smell or something like that
[57:49] because that's what what I would think
[57:52] but this smell
[57:55] smell of the burnt offering was burning
[58:00] flesh it was burning different types of
[58:04] fat from the animals and it would come
[58:07] up before the
[58:09] Lord and it pleased God to smell this
[58:14] burning fat in this burning flesh coming
[58:17] up before him now as I was studying on
[58:20] this this this week I thought why did
[58:24] that please him and I'm thinking my
[58:26] carnal
[58:27] mind a a dead animal being cooked I mean
[58:32] obviously it pleases
[58:34] me especially if Stephanie's depending
[58:37] on what she's cooking
[58:39] but not that doesn't make sense to
[58:43] me but God is looking
[58:48] down and this smell is coming up before
[58:53] him and it's a smell of an
[58:57] atonement it's a smell that something
[59:00] had
[59:02] died for the sins of his beloved
[59:07] children a wonderful smell and there
[59:10] they are and they're burning this flesh
[59:13] they're burning this fat and it's coming
[59:16] up and God is appreciating this and
[59:19] loving this because it means the
[59:21] atonement for his children that's why
[59:24] it's such a wonderful SW that's like
[59:26] it's a sweet smelling
[59:28] savor it pleased God because he knew
[59:32] that
[59:33] smell that flesh that death is an
[59:38] atonement for my
[59:44] children and
[59:46] then as we move along in the in the Book
[59:49] of
[59:50] Leviticus we we get to
[59:53] um chapters
[59:56] 8-10 and we see that that the
[1:00:00] as Moses is laying out all of these
[1:00:04] ordinances from God and all of these
[1:00:07] sacrifices so so the man would come and
[1:00:09] he put his hand on this this animal that
[1:00:12] animal would be killed and certain parts
[1:00:15] of its body would be would be cooked and
[1:00:17] and certain parts would be taken outside
[1:00:19] the camp and burned and then we have
[1:00:22] these men called the priests that are
[1:00:24] doing this holy
[1:00:27] work and these
[1:00:31] priests should be more
[1:00:34] holy than the
[1:00:36] congregation because of the importance
[1:00:39] of their
[1:00:41] job
[1:00:43] and they should
[1:00:45] never take advantage of the people and
[1:00:48] you'll you'll see what happens here
[1:00:49] shortly but everything they should live
[1:00:53] a holy life but what so amazing is that
[1:00:56] they even have to make sacrifices for
[1:01:00] themselves because they're all Sinners
[1:01:03] even these holy priests that live these
[1:01:07] what we would think would be perfect
[1:01:08] lives even they have sinned and they
[1:01:11] must make these sacrifices so let's read
[1:01:13] so you get kind of a feeling of how
[1:01:15] Leviticus is written let's read chapter
[1:01:19] 8 and this is
[1:01:21] Moses ordaining the first first
[1:01:25] ministers the first priests Moses or um
[1:01:30] Leviticus chap 8 verse one and the Lord
[1:01:33] spake unto Moses saying take Aaron
[1:01:38] now do we know now it's really important
[1:01:42] that the the these
[1:01:45] priests they they come from a certain
[1:01:47] line remember we have 12
[1:01:49] tribes and they uh they come from the
[1:01:52] tribe of Levi all right so so if you're
[1:01:56] going to be a priest you have to come
[1:01:58] from the tribe of
[1:02:01] Levi and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:02:03] saying and Moses was from the tribe of
[1:02:05] Levi and his brother Aaron obviously
[1:02:08] also was take Aaron and his sons with
[1:02:10] him and the garments and the anointing
[1:02:13] oil and a bulock for the sin offering
[1:02:15] and two Rams and a basket of unleavened
[1:02:18] bread and gather thou all the
[1:02:20] congregation together unto the door of
[1:02:22] the Tabernacle of the congre ation and
[1:02:25] Moses did as the Lord commanded him and
[1:02:28] the assembly was gathered together unto
[1:02:30] the door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:02:32] congregation and Moses said unto the
[1:02:34] congregation this is the thing which the
[1:02:37] Lord commanded to be done and Moses
[1:02:41] brought Aaron and his sons and washed
[1:02:44] them with water and he put upon him the
[1:02:49] coat and gted him with the girdle and
[1:02:51] clothed him with the robe and put the
[1:02:55] ephod upon him and he girded him with
[1:02:58] the Curious girdle of the ephod and
[1:03:00] bound it unto him therewith so he's
[1:03:03] putting on this whole
[1:03:06] uniform and he put the breastplate upon
[1:03:09] him also he put in the breastplate the
[1:03:11] urum and the thumm now we see this this
[1:03:15] urum and Thum so what this is is this is
[1:03:19] a breastplate that Aaron
[1:03:21] has and on that breast plate are lined
[1:03:25] up 12
[1:03:27] Stones and those 12 Stones represent and
[1:03:31] they're even labeled for the 12 tribes
[1:03:33] of Israel now we know from brother
[1:03:37] brandom that that uraman thumin played a
[1:03:39] very important role later on that was
[1:03:43] how many times how leaders would make
[1:03:46] the right decision is they would bring a
[1:03:49] decision before this breastplate and if
[1:03:52] it flashed then the answer was yes and
[1:03:56] if it
[1:03:58] stayed quiet then the answer was no so
[1:04:02] right here is a very very important
[1:04:03] important scripture and he put the miter
[1:04:07] upon his head and also the miter even
[1:04:09] upon his his Forefront did he put the
[1:04:13] golden plate the holy crown as the Lord
[1:04:16] commanded Moses and Moses took the
[1:04:18] anointing oil and Anointed The
[1:04:20] Tabernacle and all that was therein and
[1:04:22] Sanctified them and he
[1:04:25] sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven
[1:04:28] times and the and Anointed The Altar and
[1:04:31] all his vessels both the Laver and his
[1:04:33] foot to sanctify them and he poured of
[1:04:36] the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and
[1:04:38] anointed him to sanctify him and Moses
[1:04:42] brought Aaron's sons and put coats upon
[1:04:45] them and girded them with girdles and
[1:04:47] put bonnets upon them as the Lord
[1:04:50] commanded Moses and he brought the
[1:04:51] bulock for the sin offering and and
[1:04:54] Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon
[1:04:57] the head of the bulock for the sin
[1:05:00] offering and he slew it and Moses took
[1:05:03] the blood and put it upon the horns of
[1:05:05] the altar round about with his finger
[1:05:07] and purified The Altar and poured the
[1:05:09] blood at the bottom of the Altar and
[1:05:12] Sanctified it to make reconciliation
[1:05:14] upon
[1:05:15] it notice that again what I said these
[1:05:18] priests they also had to be
[1:05:21] purified and he took all the fat that
[1:05:23] was upon the inwards and the call above
[1:05:26] the liver and the two kidneys and their
[1:05:29] fat and Moses burnt it upon the altar
[1:05:31] but the bulock and his hide his flesh
[1:05:34] and his dung he burnt with fire without
[1:05:38] the camp outside the camp as the Lord
[1:05:40] commanded Moses and he brought the RAM
[1:05:43] for the burnt offering and Aaron and his
[1:05:45] sons laid their heads upon the RAM and
[1:05:48] he killed it and Moses sprinkled the
[1:05:50] blood upon the altar round about and he
[1:05:53] cut the ram into pieces and Moses burnt
[1:05:55] the head and the pieces and the fat and
[1:05:58] he washed the inwards and the and the
[1:06:00] legs in water and Moses burnt the whole
[1:06:02] Ram upon the altar it was a burnt
[1:06:05] sacrifice for a sweet
[1:06:09] Savor and an offering made by fire unto
[1:06:12] the Lord as the Lord commanded Moses and
[1:06:14] he brought the other Ram a ram of
[1:06:17] Consecration and Aaron and his sons laid
[1:06:19] their hand their hands on the head of
[1:06:22] the ram and he slew it and Moses took of
[1:06:25] the blood of it and put it on the tip of
[1:06:28] Aaron's right
[1:06:30] ear and upon the thumb of his right hand
[1:06:35] and upon the great toe of his right
[1:06:38] foot and he brought Aaron's sons and
[1:06:41] Moses put of the blood upon the tip of
[1:06:45] their right ear and upon the thumbs of
[1:06:48] their right hands and upon the great
[1:06:49] toes of their Right feet and Moses
[1:06:52] sprinkled the blood upon the altar round
[1:06:55] about and this is how the book of Exodus
[1:06:58] is written I mean The Book of Leviticus
[1:07:01] is
[1:07:02] written Blood on the ear it's all
[1:07:06] symbolic Blood on the ear may he hear
[1:07:08] the word of
[1:07:10] God Blood on the thumb may he do the
[1:07:14] will of God and blood on the toe may he
[1:07:18] walk in the ways of God everything in
[1:07:21] this book is symbolic and as you're
[1:07:23] reading it just stop for a minute and
[1:07:25] say Lord what do you mean by that
[1:07:28] because it's it's beyond me and there's
[1:07:29] an
[1:07:30] answer so the priests were
[1:07:33] holy the way that God's plan is but we
[1:07:39] need someone to stand for us and that's
[1:07:43] what the priests were there for they
[1:07:44] were to stand for the people but this is
[1:07:47] before Christ look at how beautiful this
[1:07:51] is all of this work that these priests
[1:07:54] had to go through yet they still this is
[1:07:57] the most beautiful thing yet they still
[1:07:59] needed a sacrifice for their own
[1:08:02] sins it shows that it's symbolic of
[1:08:06] something later to come 1500 Years Later
[1:08:10] by the way the dates that I'm
[1:08:13] getting if you have a scoffield Bible
[1:08:15] you probably already know this but if
[1:08:17] you have a scoffield Bible there's the
[1:08:20] these inner parts of it up here at the
[1:08:24] top of the center piece are the dates
[1:08:30] that this happened so if you have a
[1:08:31] scoffield Bible those are the dates that
[1:08:35] um I believe that uh scoffield took from
[1:08:37] a man publication from a man named Usher
[1:08:40] to uh to get those those dates
[1:08:44] but 1500 years after this
[1:08:48] happened a man named Jesus Christ
[1:08:52] comes now there was always a mediator
[1:08:56] between God and Men it was these it was
[1:08:57] these
[1:08:58] priests and they would do the sacrifices
[1:09:01] and they were the ones that would go in
[1:09:04] to this to this Tabernacle and offer
[1:09:06] this for the people and in fact one time
[1:09:09] a year this priest would go in behind in
[1:09:13] the back room to the holy of
[1:09:15] holies and then God's presence would
[1:09:18] come down and he would represent the
[1:09:21] people one man a year in millions of
[1:09:27] Jews but then we have the Apostle Paul
[1:09:30] come
[1:09:31] by 15600 years later and he says this
[1:09:34] for there is one
[1:09:36] God and one mediator between God and man
[1:09:41] not all of these different Levites but
[1:09:45] one mediator between God and man the man
[1:09:48] Christ
[1:09:49] Jesus all of this is
[1:09:52] symbolic of this man that was to come
[1:09:56] the whole Old Testament is laying a
[1:09:58] foundation for Jesus Christ that's how
[1:10:01] important he is and that's something
[1:10:02] friends that we
[1:10:05] lose if this book two-thirds of it in
[1:10:09] the Old Testament is written to lay a
[1:10:11] foundation for Jesus Christ how
[1:10:13] important is he I loved what brother
[1:10:15] Lyall did in his last one he was typing
[1:10:18] Exodus to to the Lord Jesus and
[1:10:22] everything is about him
[1:10:24] and if we're teaching about something
[1:10:26] else we're teaching about something
[1:10:27] that's not as important as
[1:10:31] Christ so the stakes were high for these
[1:10:34] priests they had to live a life that was
[1:10:37] above
[1:10:37] reproach and remember just there's there
[1:10:42] is just the blood of animals making this
[1:10:44] atonement not the blood of a sinless man
[1:10:47] called Jesus Christ that would one day
[1:10:48] do that so in Leviticus
[1:10:52] 9 when they make when these priests
[1:10:56] would come
[1:10:57] in and they would make these sacrifices
[1:11:02] you go through the Book of Leviticus and
[1:11:04] it lines out almost every step in what
[1:11:06] they're supposed to do so these priests
[1:11:08] would go in there and they'd follow
[1:11:10] exactly what Moses had told
[1:11:14] them and they would make the sacrifices
[1:11:17] now watch what happens when it when when
[1:11:19] they do it right Leviticus 9 chap uh
[1:11:22] verse 23 it says this and Moses and
[1:11:25] Aaron verse 23 Moses and Aaron went into
[1:11:29] the Tabernacle of the congregation and
[1:11:32] came out and blessed the people and the
[1:11:34] glory of the Lord appeared unto all the
[1:11:39] people and there came God was pleased
[1:11:42] with their worship and there came fire
[1:11:45] out from before the Lord and consumed
[1:11:49] upon the altar the burnt offering and
[1:11:52] the fat
[1:11:55] which when the people saw they shouted
[1:11:58] and fell on their
[1:12:00] faces I have that highlighted
[1:12:04] here they were around the Tabernacle and
[1:12:06] they were shouting before the glory
[1:12:09] because of the glory of the Lord now let
[1:12:11] me see this Tucson Tabernacle it's
[1:12:13] okay if you shout every once in a
[1:12:16] while it's okay if you say Amen every
[1:12:21] once in a while we're a bit of a quiet
[1:12:23] group group but I want to tell you the
[1:12:24] original Tabernacle what we are named
[1:12:27] after they shouted and they praised and
[1:12:30] here it is right here I can prove it in
[1:12:32] the
[1:12:34] scriptures so
[1:12:37] Leviticus the next chapter chapter
[1:12:40] 10 God is still dealing with the
[1:12:44] priests and it we have to as a
[1:12:50] minister now we know that the blood of
[1:12:52] Jesus Christ
[1:12:54] is
[1:12:55] there and we make
[1:12:57] mistakes and I make mistakes and I claim
[1:13:00] that blood for
[1:13:03] me but
[1:13:05] remember that this
[1:13:09] office in opening this
[1:13:13] book it should be done with fear always
[1:13:17] always with
[1:13:20] respect and
[1:13:22] preparing and and working on a sermon
[1:13:25] and praying because if I am
[1:13:30] wrong or if any Minister that stands in
[1:13:33] this Pulpit or any other Pulpit is wrong
[1:13:36] we also have a example way
[1:13:41] back in the Book of Leviticus 3500 years
[1:13:45] ago from this point that shows what
[1:13:48] happens when a minister doesn't take his
[1:13:52] office seriously
[1:13:54] Leviticus chapter
[1:13:56] 10 verse
[1:13:58] one and naab and
[1:14:02] Abu the sons of
[1:14:04] Aaron took either of them his sensor and
[1:14:08] put fire therein and put incense thereon
[1:14:11] and offered Strange Fire before the Lord
[1:14:14] which he commanded them not now we don't
[1:14:15] know what this Strange Fire is I've have
[1:14:18] studied and tried to figure out what
[1:14:20] this is it could have been that that
[1:14:22] they had these sens and and however they
[1:14:24] did it they could have even just lit it
[1:14:27] wrong everything was lined out on how to
[1:14:30] do they could have used the wrong type
[1:14:33] of vessel they could have done something
[1:14:35] wrong they did something wrong but the
[1:14:39] point
[1:14:40] is they didn't have the respect that
[1:14:42] they should
[1:14:43] have they maybe let this become common
[1:14:46] to them right and that's what happened
[1:14:51] right here and there went fire out from
[1:14:54] the
[1:14:55] Lord and devoured
[1:14:58] them and they died before the
[1:15:02] Lord they
[1:15:04] disrespected God's
[1:15:06] word the ministers
[1:15:11] did and then Moses these are his these
[1:15:13] are Aaron's two two boys his two sons
[1:15:17] then Moses said unto
[1:15:19] Aaron this is that the Lord spake saying
[1:15:24] I will be
[1:15:25] Sanctified in them that come nigh unto
[1:15:28] me these ministers are the ones that are
[1:15:31] supposed to be coming into my holy
[1:15:34] Tabernacle and they came here and they
[1:15:38] disrespected it they took it for granted
[1:15:41] they didn't take it
[1:15:46] seriously I will be Sanctified in them
[1:15:49] that come nigh to me and before all the
[1:15:52] people I will will be
[1:15:54] glorified and Aaron held his peace it
[1:15:57] was a LAX attitude from these
[1:16:00] ministers they did not respect the
[1:16:03] sacrifices of the
[1:16:05] Lord now chapters 11- 15 are about the
[1:16:09] ritual Purity required of all the
[1:16:13] Israelites and then chapters 18 through
[1:16:15] 20 are about moral Purity now Purity and
[1:16:20] impurity because God is Holy then the
[1:16:22] people as I said the people need to be
[1:16:24] holy and when they enter into his
[1:16:26] Holiness and there are words that are
[1:16:30] said that may seem kind of strange
[1:16:33] there's clean and there's
[1:16:37] unclean
[1:16:39] now it's it's now that word clean and
[1:16:45] unclean doesn't mean sin it doesn't mean
[1:16:49] that
[1:16:51] um that you uh that you have sinned so
[1:16:54] you're unclean what it is is you could
[1:16:58] come in contact with certain bodily
[1:17:00] fluids skin diseases you could touch
[1:17:03] like mold or fungus or or you could be
[1:17:06] you could touch a dead body anything
[1:17:08] that was Associated it seems that was
[1:17:10] associated with death if you touch that
[1:17:13] you become
[1:17:15] unclean or
[1:17:17] impure and then there is a purification
[1:17:20] process that you could get back but but
[1:17:22] this this wasn't necessarily
[1:17:25] sin it wasn't sinful there was a
[1:17:28] purification process as I said and then
[1:17:31] the person could come back what was
[1:17:33] sinful was to
[1:17:35] disrespect God's
[1:17:38] rules what these two sons of Aaron
[1:17:42] did and then another form of impurity
[1:17:45] was eating certain types of animals and
[1:17:48] some of these animals they're a bit odd
[1:17:51] God's holiness was reflected in in every
[1:17:53] part of everyone's lives from the their
[1:17:56] diet to the way that they wash their
[1:17:58] hands all the way till they to they came
[1:18:01] to the priest and then the priest
[1:18:02] offered the sacrifices I was in I was in
[1:18:05] Israel a few years ago and uh we had
[1:18:08] this really hardcore Jewish guide and we
[1:18:14] uh we went around and we came to the
[1:18:17] place where is celebrated as the place
[1:18:20] that that Jesus was baptized by John the
[1:18:22] Baptist
[1:18:24] and we were there and then we had all
[1:18:25] these Americans that were in the bus and
[1:18:27] then some some people from other a
[1:18:29] couple people from other countries and
[1:18:31] there were all of these if you looked
[1:18:33] out there there were all these
[1:18:34] catfish swimming around in the Jordan
[1:18:37] River big ones they they were going
[1:18:40] around I was thinking man I wish I had
[1:18:42] my fishing pole you know I'd sneak right
[1:18:45] Upstream a little bit and I was watching
[1:18:47] these catfish so then the tour guide he
[1:18:49] remember he's Jewish he tells all of
[1:18:52] these all of of these people he's
[1:18:53] talking loud like I am and he's he's
[1:18:55] giving the tour and he says oh he says a
[1:18:57] catfish is a filthy animal he says he
[1:19:00] says they go in the mud and they eat bad
[1:19:02] things and he says oh if if just people
[1:19:05] if anybody would eat a catfish it would
[1:19:07] make them sick and and there just
[1:19:09] there's just no way that they should
[1:19:11] they should eat these disgusting animals
[1:19:13] it makes a disgusting person that would
[1:19:15] do that so one of the
[1:19:18] Americans says goes up to him and I I
[1:19:21] see him he whispers he said hey um
[1:19:24] Americans they eat
[1:19:27] catfish and I was like listen and he
[1:19:30] goes oh so then he goes back and he says
[1:19:33] oh but but I'm sure it's okay to eat it
[1:19:35] you know you know they're they're
[1:19:36] they're God's creation they're animals
[1:19:38] and and then he starts making excuses to
[1:19:40] why what he said was wasn't wasn't right
[1:19:43] it wasn't as hardcore as it was I
[1:19:45] thought I thought that was kind of funny
[1:19:46] but that's how he
[1:19:48] thought of of this type of food that was
[1:19:52] laid out in this This Book of Leviticus
[1:19:54] that you don't
[1:19:55] eat
[1:19:57] so you take that Through the
[1:20:00] Ages and sometimes it is a protection if
[1:20:04] you look in 14th century Europe the
[1:20:09] plague was just destroying
[1:20:13] Europe and the Jews which there are many
[1:20:16] of them for the most
[1:20:19] part they escaped the in ction of the
[1:20:23] plague and it was because of their
[1:20:27] hygiene because of their diet because of
[1:20:29] the way that they ate they escaped much
[1:20:32] of these dreaded diseases just because
[1:20:36] they followed This Book of
[1:20:39] Leviticus then Leviticus chapter 16 and
[1:20:42] 17 talks about the day of of atonement
[1:20:45] now to me when I was reading this as I
[1:20:48] said I was so
[1:20:49] excited when when I read this book and
[1:20:54] it's a day it's really the Highlight to
[1:20:57] me of the book it's not necessarily a
[1:20:59] day of Celebration it's really a day of
[1:21:01] repentance
[1:21:03] mourning for all the sacrifices done for
[1:21:07] the people during the year when they
[1:21:08] would
[1:21:10] sin the sins of every person there
[1:21:13] there's no way that they could be
[1:21:16] covered for the everyone going and
[1:21:19] offering the the sins and sacrifices let
[1:21:21] me stop there for a moment
[1:21:25] when
[1:21:26] these sacrifices were brought to the
[1:21:30] priests to be
[1:21:33] offered they were whether it be a lamb
[1:21:36] or a goat or a or a bull it was the very
[1:21:42] best that they could
[1:21:44] get this was the prized
[1:21:49] bull or the most beautiful lamb that
[1:21:52] that they could find it was important
[1:21:55] that these these Jews had the
[1:22:00] best sacrifice that could be made
[1:22:04] because it it was for their atonement
[1:22:06] for their sins and as you see the Bible
[1:22:09] go
[1:22:11] along you see the people start to stray
[1:22:14] from that and you get to the last of the
[1:22:17] Old Testament This Book of
[1:22:19] Malachi and it had just gone
[1:22:23] South now they were taking just the the
[1:22:26] ones with broken legs the one that
[1:22:28] couldn't they couldn't sell they were
[1:22:29] taking the very worst of the
[1:22:31] sacrifices and offering that up because
[1:22:34] it didn't take anything out of their
[1:22:36] pocket they still did their sacrifices
[1:22:38] but it wasn't
[1:22:39] sincere but we see here in Leviticus we
[1:22:42] see it is the very
[1:22:44] best that they could that they could
[1:22:46] bring before the priest and friends that
[1:22:49] is what has happened to this world look
[1:22:53] at as I was preaching this
[1:22:56] morning do we offer God our very
[1:22:59] best when we
[1:23:02] pray is it at the time that my mind is
[1:23:05] most
[1:23:07] clear is it or is it just oh yeah I
[1:23:10] forgot to pray I gotta I got to spend a
[1:23:11] couple minutes in prayer before I go to
[1:23:13] bed I'm tired
[1:23:16] anyways do we offer God our very very
[1:23:21] best
[1:23:23] with our tithes with our offerings with
[1:23:26] with our prayers with our devotions with
[1:23:29] our families everything is it God
[1:23:32] first or is it the
[1:23:35] typical world of today where I'll give
[1:23:39] God a little bit what whatever I can
[1:23:42] spare and I'm not talking about money
[1:23:44] I'm talking about your time I'm talking
[1:23:46] about your feelings I'm talking about
[1:23:49] your
[1:23:50] prayers am I giving God my very best my
[1:23:55] time they did here in This Book of
[1:23:58] Leviticus so this day of
[1:24:01] atonement it was a time as I said
[1:24:06] when that the atoned it atoned for all
[1:24:10] the sins that weren't yet
[1:24:12] covered one of the
[1:24:14] sacrifices for this day of atonement
[1:24:16] they take two goats one goat is killed
[1:24:20] on behalf of the nation and it's killed
[1:24:24] receiving the punishment for the nation
[1:24:26] so the nation should not die of those
[1:24:28] unatoned for sins and the second and
[1:24:31] this is what blessed me so much this was
[1:24:35] my highlight of reading this book the
[1:24:40] second is what's called a scapegoat you
[1:24:42] ever hear that that term the priests
[1:24:47] they kill the first
[1:24:49] goat and then the priest lays his his
[1:24:52] hands both hands this time on the head
[1:24:55] of this goat and he lays symbolically he
[1:24:59] lays the sins of the
[1:25:01] Nation on this goat and then he turns it
[1:25:05] Loose Into the
[1:25:06] Wilderness and they watch this goat
[1:25:10] travel away
[1:25:13] knowing that the sins of the whole
[1:25:16] country are on that
[1:25:19] animal and they wanted to get as far
[1:25:23] away as it can be because it's carrying
[1:25:26] their sins farther and farther away and
[1:25:30] as they see the goat getting smaller and
[1:25:33] smaller and they're taking note he's
[1:25:35] gone this way he's gone that way he's
[1:25:36] going farther and they're Joy just gets
[1:25:39] greater and greater as that goat would
[1:25:42] go far until he's finally
[1:25:45] gone our
[1:25:47] sins completely taken away and when I
[1:25:51] read that I remember
[1:25:52] a few years ago I break broke down
[1:25:55] crying thinking that Jesus Christ is the
[1:25:58] one that took my sins he represented
[1:26:01] that scapegoat he stood for me he took
[1:26:04] my sins and he took them far
[1:26:08] away so far away that they're completely
[1:26:11] gone out of the remembrance of even
[1:26:16] God what a
[1:26:18] wonderful wonderful thing this scapegoat
[1:26:21] and what it represents taking our sins
[1:26:25] and walking through the Wilderness till
[1:26:27] it's completely
[1:26:29] gone this happened every year this day
[1:26:31] of
[1:26:34] atonement and friends the as we as we
[1:26:37] get to the close of
[1:26:39] this the purpose of this law that we see
[1:26:44] in
[1:26:44] Leviticus was not to show how
[1:26:47] approachable God
[1:26:50] is it was to show how
[1:26:52] unapproachable he was back then it was
[1:26:57] to show how careful you had to be look
[1:26:58] at those two priests they offered
[1:27:00] Strange Fire we don't even know what it
[1:27:02] was but they just they just took it a
[1:27:05] little bit
[1:27:07] common and God struck him dead right
[1:27:11] there you couldn't just go to God only
[1:27:15] that priest could go for
[1:27:17] you and the priest had to go under the
[1:27:20] sacrifice even of a clean animal and let
[1:27:23] me stop right here that's why Roman
[1:27:26] Catholicism is
[1:27:28] wrong the very
[1:27:30] tenants of the Catholic church that a
[1:27:33] priest can answer for the sins of the
[1:27:36] people that is passed it didn't work
[1:27:40] that was a period of time that was to
[1:27:43] stay the wrath of God now we have Jesus
[1:27:45] Christ it can't be a priest that answers
[1:27:48] for your your sins it can't be a pastor
[1:27:50] that answers for your sins it certainly
[1:27:51] can't be
[1:27:53] Mary that is a mediator between you and
[1:27:56] God only one man the man Christ Jesus in
[1:28:01] this whole Book of Leviticus shows that
[1:28:04] these priests are an example of Christ
[1:28:08] but they were an impure example Christ
[1:28:10] didn't need to do a we didn't have to
[1:28:12] have a sacrifice for Jesus Christ he was
[1:28:14] perfect in every way lived a perfect
[1:28:18] life in every way you heard that Jesus
[1:28:21] is the high
[1:28:22] priest that's what it's talking
[1:28:25] about right here in the Book of
[1:28:31] Leviticus chapters 18-
[1:28:34] 27 are about fellowship with God through
[1:28:38] sanctification through living a clean
[1:28:41] life and it it you see the way that the
[1:28:44] Jews have become and all of their little
[1:28:47] rituals and everything that that they do
[1:28:50] it comes from this book Book of
[1:28:52] Leviticus and and how that they live
[1:28:55] their life and to make themselves pure
[1:29:00] but they don't have
[1:29:01] Christ it didn't work with the
[1:29:06] priests it was something to stay as I
[1:29:10] said to stay the wrath of God yet
[1:29:11] they're trying there's for 2,000 years
[1:29:14] they've been trying to stay with it we
[1:29:17] should be thankful every day that we
[1:29:19] have that atonement called Jesus Christ
[1:29:22] that This Book of Leviticus is
[1:29:25] alive in a man a man that rose from the
[1:29:29] dead and it's true every word in this
[1:29:33] book is is true and it's beautiful and
[1:29:36] it's represented the reason it's so
[1:29:38] beautiful the reason it's so great is
[1:29:40] because it became
[1:29:42] flesh and dwelt among
[1:29:45] us and gave his life and then rose from
[1:29:50] the dead one little nugget that's easy
[1:29:54] to overlook can we go back to Genesis I
[1:29:57] mean sorry Leviticus 1 verse
[1:30:00] one I really like
[1:30:04] this and the Lord called unto Moses and
[1:30:07] spake unto him out of the Tabernacle of
[1:30:12] the
[1:30:13] congregation what does that
[1:30:16] mean English Standard Version says this
[1:30:19] the Lord called to Moses and spoke to
[1:30:21] him from the tent of the meeting from
[1:30:24] the Tabernacle so we see Moses out here
[1:30:29] and we see God here and God is speaking
[1:30:31] to Moses from the house of the
[1:30:35] Lord now let's go to the next book
[1:30:41] Numbers chapter 1 verse one now watch
[1:30:44] what the book this is just me but the
[1:30:48] Book of Leviticus did something this law
[1:30:52] that God gave to Moses to be implemented
[1:30:54] did something look at this and the Lord
[1:30:58] spake unto Moses in the wilderness
[1:31:02] in the Tabernacle of the
[1:31:05] congregation so before Moses was
[1:31:09] outside now This Book of
[1:31:11] Leviticus now Moses gets to get in go
[1:31:14] inside and the Lord's speaking to him
[1:31:17] right
[1:31:19] there we can uh we can close if the
[1:31:21] musicians are ready um the New
[1:31:26] Testament quotes The Book of Leviticus
[1:31:29] more than 100
[1:31:32] times and this is the book that I just
[1:31:34] wanted to get
[1:31:35] through because I didn't understand it
[1:31:38] more than a hundred times what other
[1:31:40] book does the New Testament quote that
[1:31:42] many
[1:31:43] times the book of
[1:31:47] Hebrews is one that highlights over and
[1:31:50] over the sacrifice ices and types in The
[1:31:54] Book of Leviticus
[1:31:57] beautiful tremendous tremendous book so
[1:32:01] we have
[1:32:02] here we have this Book of Leviticus it
[1:32:05] told them how to do everything it told
[1:32:07] them all the rules and the regulations
[1:32:10] and how to come into the presence of God
[1:32:12] remember said God's like the sun you
[1:32:14] don't you couldn't get too close to him
[1:32:16] or you die if you get too far away from
[1:32:19] him you get cold you get worldly and you
[1:32:21] die out there so you want to just be in
[1:32:23] his presence all the time and the Book
[1:32:24] of Leviticus shows that and it gives
[1:32:27] ways to do that now I want to give an
[1:32:31] example to lay a foundation for
[1:32:35] Wednesday so we have the 10 commandments
[1:32:38] remember from the book of Exodus and
[1:32:40] then the Book of
[1:32:41] Leviticus adds to those honor the
[1:32:45] Sabbath day and keep it
[1:32:50] holy so
[1:32:52] we see in the next
[1:32:55] book this guy's
[1:32:59] out and it's the Sabbath day Saturday
[1:33:03] back then that has to be kept
[1:33:05] holy and he's out and he needs to
[1:33:09] uh maybe warm his house or cook some
[1:33:13] food and he goes out in his
[1:33:16] yard and he picks up a couple
[1:33:20] sticks takes him brings him back to his
[1:33:27] house some of the other
[1:33:31] people in the congregation the other
[1:33:34] Hebrews they
[1:33:37] looked they were
[1:33:41] studying today's a
[1:33:43] Sabbath you're not supposed to do
[1:33:47] that
[1:33:49] huh so they go back
[1:33:53] they're like like man Aaron just not
[1:33:55] Aaron that would mess up everything
[1:34:00] Joe Aaron was the
[1:34:02] priest Jo Joseph here he
[1:34:06] goes Joseph went and he was picking up
[1:34:10] sticks on the
[1:34:13] Sabbath so they go and they take they
[1:34:16] take this information to Moses and to
[1:34:18] Aaron they're like hey um we don't know
[1:34:21] but but it says this the law says
[1:34:24] this Joe Miller was up picking up sticks
[1:34:28] Moses what do we
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:32] do you're going to find out when brother
[1:34:35] Lyall
[1:34:37] preaches it's really an amazing end that
[1:34:41] you stand back and you say
[1:34:44] whoa this a big deal let's all stand
[1:34:50] there
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:56] I claim the
[1:34:59] blood Jesus shed on
[1:35:04] [Music]

[1:36:21] when I need
[1:36:25] healing oh I claim
[1:36:29] those blood stains it's a fitting
[1:36:32] fitting song for This Book of Leviticus
[1:36:35] it was all about the blood it was all
[1:36:38] about the
[1:36:40] sacrifice and these people were
[1:36:43] sincere and they gave their very best
[1:36:46] they tried to do it the best that they
[1:36:50] could and honoring what the prophet
[1:36:53] Moses brought from God concerning how to
[1:37:00] come into the presence of God for
[1:37:03] communion with god brother Ron if you'd
[1:37:05] come and
[1:37:07] close how important it is brothers and

[1:37:22] but we've come into an attitude today
[1:37:25] where we don't
[1:37:26] respect this
[1:37:28] book we don't give the prophets the
[1:37:30] respect that we should give them the
[1:37:33] ministry doesn't give the word the
[1:37:35] respect that it
[1:37:38] should I want to make sure that if you
[1:37:40] get anything out of the Book of
[1:37:43] Leviticus this book is about our Lord
[1:37:46] and Savior Jesus Christ and it's

[1:45:24] first fruits of the
[1:45:27] Harvest whether it be a lump of figs or
[1:45:29] whether it be wheat or whatever it was
[1:45:32] and the priest took it and he waved it
[1:45:35] in front of the
[1:45:36] people and he said look this is what is
[1:45:41] going to come these are the first fruits
[1:45:44] Harvest is almost
