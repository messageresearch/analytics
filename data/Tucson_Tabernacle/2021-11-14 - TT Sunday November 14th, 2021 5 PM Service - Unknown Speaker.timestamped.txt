[29:05] what love i am redeemed bought with a
[29:08] price
[29:10] oh i
[29:11] am
[29:13] breeding
[29:16] what with the blind
[29:21] jesus
[29:23] has changed my whole life
[29:30] if
[29:32] anybody asks you
[29:36] just
[29:39] [Music]
[29:43] let's stand as we sing that one more
[29:45] time
[29:45] reading
[29:50] oh
[29:51] i
[29:51] am
[29:53] [Music]
[30:00] jesus
[30:02] has changed my whole life
[30:10] if
[30:11] anybody asks you
[30:15] just
[30:18] [Music]
[30:27] you believe that
[30:29] you honestly believe that then you have
[30:31] to realize you were part of him
[30:33] in the first place
[30:35] to redeem something means that one time
[30:37] you had it
[30:37] [Music]
[30:39] it's been bought and been paid for
[30:42] to restore something you have to have
[30:44] the original product to restore it back
[30:47] i've always said you can't restore a 55
[30:49] ford to a 57 chevy they're not the same
[30:52] product
[30:53] if you're trying to restore a 55 ford
[30:55] you've got to start with a 55 port
[30:58] right
[30:59] now you could make something over
[31:02] you could try to transform it but if
[31:04] you're redeeming or you're restoring you
[31:06] start with the original product and when
[31:08] you say i am redeemed you're saying i'm
[31:10] part of him and he's redeemed me
[31:14] back to himself amen it's it's good to
[31:16] know that thank you
[31:18] we don't want to keep them up
[31:20] well maybe we do
[31:23] sometimes if you watch some of the
[31:24] services
[31:26] especially especially amongst
[31:28] our colored bread and they'll have the
[31:29] organist and the piano play through the
[31:31] hole
[31:32] and they'll emphasize and they'll add
[31:34] some you know
[31:36] but no no i don't think we want to do
[31:37] that so
[31:39] good to be in the house of the lord
[31:41] again today and
[31:42] there was an incident out outside right
[31:45] is before service started and
[31:47] fire trucks paramedics police and
[31:51] um just kind of finding out some
[31:53] something had happened there and
[31:56] they were maybe going to look at our
[31:57] security cameras to see if they could
[31:59] see something there but
[32:02] my thoughts was never a dull moment in
[32:04] this neighborhood
[32:06] but as i know down to pray back there i
[32:08] said lord it's satan's eden
[32:11] and but greater is he that is in us than
[32:14] he that is in the world and he's our
[32:16] protector he's our keeper so
[32:18] we'll read this the beginning verse
[32:20] again with again brother jordan john
[32:24] chapter one one through five and then
[32:27] we'll get into
[32:29] another part of
[32:31] of his thoughts
[32:33] the expression of his thoughts is
[32:36] becoming word
[32:38] in the beginning was the word and the
[32:40] word was with god
[32:43] and the word was god
[32:45] the same was in the beginning with god
[32:48] all things were made by him and without
[32:50] him was not anything made that was made
[32:55] in him was life
[32:57] and the life was the light of men
[33:00] and then the light shineth in darkness
[33:02] and darkness comprendeth it not they
[33:05] cannot darkness doesn't understand light
[33:09] and
[33:10] when you start to think about it
[33:11] darkness and light
[33:14] you say they don't know light
[33:15] is greater than darkness
[33:17] darkness cannot you have to turn off the
[33:19] light for darkness to exist
[33:23] so
[33:24] light can exist without itself without
[33:27] anything but darkness needs light to be
[33:30] pulled away
[33:31] so greater is he that is in you
[33:33] than he that is in the world lord we
[33:35] thank you that
[33:37] in a way that you chose lord
[33:40] through written scripture
[33:42] through spoken word lord
[33:45] to reveal yourself lord
[33:47] and then your presence comes lord and
[33:49] you make it real to us lord it's just
[33:52] it's just wonderful how you do things
[33:54] lord and we appreciate lord speak to our
[33:56] hearts today
[33:57] we ask you in jesus christ's name
[33:59] amen you may be seated
[34:02] it's um
[34:05] i was listening to
[34:07] the last part of
[34:09] lean not
[34:10] to thy known understanding and
[34:13] you know as human you you want to be
[34:15] able to comprehend you want to be able
[34:16] to strengthen you want to make sense out
[34:18] of things you know
[34:21] and you're taught that in school
[34:24] two plus two is four
[34:26] and four plus four is eight
[34:28] and then as you get a little further
[34:30] along in school a little older a little
[34:32] to understand more then there's
[34:33] variations but it's still all the same
[34:35] loss
[34:37] but now you get two and a 2a and they
[34:40] put letters and numbers and then they
[34:43] put this and that the other and a lot of
[34:44] us got lost about that
[34:46] time um
[34:49] but it's all something god said in order
[34:53] uh the laws of physic the laws of
[34:55] everything that happens they they can
[34:57] take a rock and shoot it up and and know
[34:59] where they're going to be and when
[35:00] they're going to get there they're
[35:01] watching because god set things in order
[35:03] and god is perfect
[35:05] it's not his creation wasn't let's just
[35:08] toss it out let's see what happens
[35:11] you know he knows every star he knows
[35:13] every everything they can tell you when
[35:15] a
[35:17] a
[35:18] an event is going to happen in space and
[35:20] they can hit it right on
[35:22] you know because god's laws are perfect
[35:26] and and you know so
[35:27] man man at times feels like wow we've
[35:30] really done something and and i i
[35:32] appreciate that man has been able to do
[35:34] the things that they do
[35:35] there are conveniences and things in our
[35:37] lives that is much easier to deal with
[35:39] today you know
[35:41] um if if you uh if you were
[35:44] way back when there was
[35:46] if you wanted light you had to have a
[35:47] candle or you had to have a fire going
[35:49] so the day started when the sun came up
[35:51] the day ended basically when the sun
[35:53] went down
[35:54] but today you can have a factory working
[35:56] 24 hours a day because you can light it
[35:58] up you can power it up god has allowed
[36:01] things for us to do and
[36:03] you go out on a horse i i think about
[36:06] those coming across from the east
[36:08] working their way across west and you
[36:10] read the his the stories and the the
[36:13] things that happened how many months how
[36:15] much time it took
[36:17] you know they might they might leave in
[36:19] in early spring
[36:22] and winter would come and they'd only be
[36:24] halfway across the country and they
[36:25] would have to win or somewhere to
[36:27] continue the journey
[36:30] you know on on the next year or so
[36:32] and today you know
[36:35] in a day you can cross several
[36:37] continents
[36:39] i was speaking with brother rob fero one
[36:41] day and it was a 15-hour flight to go
[36:43] from here to when his daughter elizabeth
[36:45] lived in australia
[36:47] and 15 hours seems a long time
[36:51] but before it would take you three years
[36:53] on the ship
[36:54] so you know god has allowed these things
[36:57] to happen and i appreciate it
[36:59] it's you know just um
[37:02] they have to to do the things that that
[37:04] you know before it took ten men and now
[37:06] you have a machine you press a button
[37:07] and it does it so
[37:10] but sometimes if we're not careful it
[37:11] makes us lazy
[37:13] it makes us take things for granted you
[37:15] know but i appreciate that um
[37:19] so as we spoke this this morning
[37:22] god's thoughts
[37:24] and also
[37:26] when you can look at the scriptures
[37:27] where it speaks and use the word
[37:29] thoughts it's also god's plans
[37:31] there's another way god thought this or
[37:33] god planned this
[37:35] and and
[37:36] again what god thinks and plans he he
[37:39] does
[37:41] it's part it it's it's amazing that when
[37:43] you think about it god can say let there
[37:45] be and there was
[37:50] a lot of times for us is i hope
[37:53] i i want this to happen and i pray that
[37:55] when that time comes around we're able
[37:57] to do it
[37:58] we make our plans we we would like to do
[38:01] this
[38:02] maybe as a as a parent as a as a father
[38:06] and you you'd like to you say i'd like
[38:08] to help the children do this if this
[38:10] would work out we would do that and at
[38:11] times it doesn't work out
[38:14] but god's word
[38:16] says let there be and there is
[38:19] and there's something we can count on so
[38:21] and we know in jeremiah he said i know
[38:23] my thoughts that i have to
[38:26] but in philippians here here paul says
[38:28] philippians 4 8 and brother jordan let
[38:30] me jump around a little bit so
[38:33] you can
[38:35] kind of look it up i we try to send him
[38:37] the scriptures and the quotes so that he
[38:39] can pull them up
[38:41] philippians 4 8
[38:45] and and uh we know that it's it's their
[38:47] their scripture we finally brethren
[38:50] whatsoever things are true
[38:52] and whatsoever things are honest
[38:54] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[38:57] things are pure whatsoever things are
[39:00] lovely whatsoever things are of a good
[39:02] report if there any be if there be any
[39:05] virtue and if there be any praise
[39:08] think on these things
[39:11] so there's another thought process there
[39:13] to think on those things
[39:16] to meditate on those things to let them
[39:19] fill your life
[39:21] uh we mentioned here the other day and
[39:23] speaking
[39:24] listening to brother lonnie jenkins
[39:25] testimony and he called them prayer
[39:27] aspirants
[39:29] you know when he had that urge to smoke
[39:31] a cigarette before he was chained before
[39:33] he was converted and and he was just
[39:35] coming into the knowledge of the lord
[39:37] he would ask the lord when he'd get that
[39:39] desire he would say lord help me through
[39:40] this and he called him prayer aspirants
[39:43] and i thought to myself that's a good
[39:45] thing to do
[39:46] when you're about you're feeling like
[39:47] you're gonna you're getting into some
[39:49] trouble and you say lord i need some
[39:50] help
[39:51] so when we had the fellowship here on
[39:53] friday evening when i was talking with
[39:55] the family and they told me it works
[39:57] brother
[39:58] this week i've used it and it's really
[40:01] has helped me
[40:02] to stop for a moment so lord i need your
[40:04] help during through this time i need and
[40:06] and and what happened with me when when
[40:08] that song got stuck in my head and i
[40:10] couldn't get out and i said lord can you
[40:12] help me with this and he replaced it
[40:14] with a song of think about his love
[40:17] think about his goodness and you don't
[40:19] know how many times now i have stopped
[40:21] when it starts and i said now wait a
[40:22] minute think about his love and i began
[40:24] to sing that and it changes the whole
[40:25] atmosphere
[40:26] it works
[40:28] as easy as it is to open the bottle of
[40:30] tylenol or aspirin and take them
[40:33] and and it's not one of those things
[40:34] that you know if you get to doing it all
[40:36] the time
[40:37] you just do it
[40:39] you don't think about it you don't study
[40:41] it you don't read all the ingredients
[40:43] that's in it in the bottle every time
[40:45] you just open it you do it
[40:47] now maybe some of you do read all the
[40:49] ingredients of all your medication maybe
[40:51] by the time you finish with the
[40:52] ingredients you forgot what you were
[40:53] taking it for so you don't i don't know
[40:56] but we just get to it and that's how it
[40:58] should be with god it should be a
[41:00] natural thing where you just say yes
[41:02] lord
[41:04] and we take it because see you're part
[41:05] of them he said let there be and there
[41:08] was
[41:09] now sometimes we want that let there be
[41:11] to be now
[41:13] instant like when you flick on the
[41:14] switch and the light turns on
[41:17] but we don't know how much time went
[41:19] from when he said let there be
[41:21] but it went into motion it began to work
[41:24] so
[41:27] and micah chapter 4
[41:30] verse 12
[41:33] that uh
[41:36] here it says but they know not the
[41:38] thoughts of the lord
[41:40] neither understand they they his counsel
[41:46] and micah here saying there are those
[41:48] that don't know that
[41:51] but we do
[41:52] he says for he shall gather them as a
[41:54] sheaves under the floor
[41:56] but he said they know not they don't
[41:58] understand his counsel and in
[42:01] by the grace of god and his mercy
[42:03] because you were part of him
[42:05] he shares with you
[42:08] he comes down to visit abraham
[42:11] and he says according to the time of
[42:12] life
[42:14] you know i'm going to visit you
[42:16] but then he says shall i share my
[42:18] secrets with abraham
[42:21] he calls moses up onto the mountain and
[42:23] he's lip to ear
[42:26] all the way into our day he still speaks
[42:28] he still makes himself known he still
[42:30] talks to you
[42:31] listening to to the end part there of
[42:34] of lean not to their own understanding
[42:36] brother branham is ministering at the
[42:38] very end of the service and he begins to
[42:40] call out and he begins to tell them
[42:42] their name where they're from and
[42:43] everything about him he's still the same
[42:45] yesterday today and forever
[42:47] he knows he can reach in and diagnose
[42:50] the situation
[42:51] and you know we we're we're grateful we
[42:54] watch them
[42:55] outside trying to take care of
[42:57] and then we watched the police walking
[42:58] up and down the street as they were
[43:00] looking to their evidence as best as
[43:02] they can
[43:03] but we have one that knows all things
[43:06] the cause the root the effect
[43:09] you know in our our places to have
[43:12] confidence and trust in him
[43:14] and he says
[43:17] in isaiah 55
[43:20] 8-11
[43:23] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[43:26] and i'm glad
[43:28] that god doesn't have to deal with some
[43:30] other things in this sense although he
[43:31] did
[43:33] when he walked in flesh
[43:36] and sometimes that's hard to
[43:38] understand that god himself would put
[43:41] himself in human flesh
[43:43] to be tested tempted tried the same way
[43:47] we are
[43:49] if he stepped on on a rock barefooted it
[43:52] hurt him
[43:54] he felt it
[43:56] if he cut himself he bled
[43:59] he said i'm tired i i'm going to lay
[44:01] myself to sleep he was going across on
[44:03] the ship and he lay down to rest
[44:07] so that he could understand and be
[44:09] touched by the feeling of our
[44:10] infirmities
[44:12] yet he's the one that spoke
[44:15] and the worlds were made you would say
[44:16] well how
[44:17] because he wanted to restore the
[44:21] fellowship with his children
[44:24] so
[44:25] he says my thoughts are not your
[44:27] thoughts
[44:28] neither are your ways my way saith the
[44:31] lord
[44:33] he said for as the heavens are higher
[44:35] than the earth so are my ways higher
[44:37] than your ways and my thoughts than your
[44:40] thoughts
[44:41] a little example here
[44:43] brother branham says we will travel like
[44:46] a thought
[44:49] brother lyle how fast
[44:51] approximately how many miles per hour
[44:52] does a rocket go when whether it's going
[44:54] to the moon you have any idea though
[44:57] about 25 000.
[44:59] most of us have never been that fast
[45:04] you know
[45:04] in fact some of us in the mail outside
[45:06] of an airplane but hopefully driving
[45:08] you've never even been 100.
[45:10] yeah well
[45:12] i'm not going to say some of you may
[45:13] have some you've got to look like oh yes
[45:15] i
[45:16] have but to think 25 000 miles you
[45:19] really can't comprehend that
[45:22] how fast that is to go travel that many
[45:24] miles from to hit from earth to hit this
[45:27] proper spot to land on the moon
[45:30] but branham says you'll travel like a
[45:33] thought
[45:36] i would like to be in australia right
[45:38] now and you're there
[45:42] brother aaron is that possible with god
[45:45] all things are possible
[45:47] and he shows us in the scripture
[45:49] when philip is out there
[45:51] and he says now go over there and
[45:52] actually know philip is running next to
[45:54] that eunuch
[45:57] because god is the same yesterday today
[46:00] and forever
[46:02] so see he says my thoughts are your
[46:04] thoughts he goes the way i work is
[46:05] different than what you you're limited
[46:07] you're bound
[46:09] to this flesh to this earth
[46:13] but he gives us glimpses he gives us a
[46:15] way to see to to say yes lord that is
[46:17] possible
[46:18] he said for as the rain cometh down the
[46:20] snow from heaven and returneth not
[46:22] thither but watereth the earth and
[46:25] maketh it bring forth and bud that it
[46:27] may give seed to the sower and bread to
[46:29] the eater then he eye like this
[46:32] so shall my word be that go forth out of
[46:35] my mouth
[46:36] it shall not return unto me void but it
[46:39] shall accomplish that which i please and
[46:42] it shall prosper in the thing where unto
[46:45] i sent it
[46:47] how many knows that you're one of those
[46:50] you are prosper or god has sent because
[46:52] he said you and you all that were poured
[46:56] all that the father has given me
[47:01] just just some scriptures here
[47:03] psalms 94 19.
[47:08] david looks at and says it this way
[47:10] in the multitude of my thoughts within
[47:13] me thy comforts delight my soul so we're
[47:16] looking at thoughts in a little
[47:18] different
[47:19] line right here the human thought
[47:23] sometimes our thoughts are are very
[47:24] human
[47:27] there's anguish in them there's hurts in
[47:29] them there's there's things going on but
[47:31] then david says
[47:34] like thy comforts delight my soul
[47:39] because he's remembering what god has
[47:41] said
[47:43] he's taking what god has said and said
[47:45] those are the things that are going to
[47:46] comfort me those are the things that i'm
[47:48] going to be encouraged those are the
[47:50] things that are going to strengthen me
[47:52] what god has said about me
[47:56] brother branham there in the end there
[47:58] he's he's ministering at the end of the
[48:00] service and he begins to call out
[48:02] just he said i just want to show you as
[48:04] he's speaking uh that he's the same
[48:06] yesterday today and forever
[48:09] and he and he's praying for some folks
[48:10] and he begins now now you he said uh
[48:13] your name is and he would say their name
[48:14] and talk where they're from you're not
[48:15] from here you're from california oh i
[48:18] see you're a minister also and he begins
[48:20] to tell
[48:22] because god is showing that he's able
[48:24] that he still does those things he can
[48:27] he can read he can know who you are and
[48:28] he's just encouraging us
[48:31] to believe that he's the same yesterday
[48:32] today and forever
[48:34] because
[48:36] the god that many many today know is
[48:39] just a god of history
[48:42] just a god of the ministry
[48:44] just a god of the priest or this but no
[48:46] he's a god of each individual
[48:49] of each person
[48:50] see this body here when when i take a
[48:53] breath of air
[48:54] whether i breathe it through my nose or
[48:56] my mouth it affects my whole body
[48:59] when you drink water it goes down
[49:01] through the throat
[49:03] works the way but it affects the whole
[49:04] body
[49:06] what god is doing is for each and every
[49:08] one
[49:10] you know the inspiration the life and
[49:12] all is for everyone to receive every
[49:14] part of the body when you're taking you
[49:16] eat and the minerals the vitamins
[49:18] whatever you take it goes and it affects
[49:20] and strengthens the whole body
[49:22] and that's why david said
[49:24] in the multitude of my thoughts within
[49:26] me thy
[49:28] comforts delight my soul
[49:31] and and just sometimes we have to stop
[49:33] and say lord what your word says
[49:35] what's your word says
[49:37] more than what i'm going through right
[49:39] now
[49:40] psalms 33 11.
[49:45] the counsel of the lord standeth forever
[49:49] the thoughts of his heart to all
[49:51] generations
[49:54] the counsel of the lord stands forever
[49:57] there's no shadow of turning
[50:00] there's no darkness in his light
[50:02] it is constant it's pure it's the same
[50:04] yesterday today and forever he doesn't
[50:07] have to go back and say you know what
[50:09] yeah you stumped me with that one let me
[50:11] go back and let's work this out you know
[50:14] we were working on this and this is what
[50:15] we were hoping for but this is what we
[50:18] got
[50:19] so now we got to work on it again
[50:21] you know if you read the history of many
[50:23] of the inventions there was a lot of
[50:25] failures
[50:27] before they got the product
[50:29] there was a lot of testing a lot of
[50:31] trying a lot of this a lot of
[50:33] trial and error if you want to call it
[50:36] but in god the first time it was right
[50:39] he didn't have to change it
[50:41] and that's this is the counsel of the
[50:43] lord standeth forever the thoughts of
[50:45] his heart to all generations
[50:49] and i appreciate and just just thinking
[50:51] of that along with being redeemed
[50:54] being restored back
[50:56] that's what redemption is being restored
[50:59] back to
[51:01] what was yours in the first place
[51:03] it in in
[51:05] in in that expression of being restored
[51:09] being brought back it's
[51:11] today in in in america especially and
[51:14] actually and all over the world it's
[51:15] really gotten around is
[51:17] going back and trying to restore to
[51:20] the native tribes to the different ones
[51:23] who things were taken from who who they
[51:26] were they were
[51:28] treated wrong and all
[51:29] and and i know in all of that there's
[51:31] people that take full advantage of it
[51:33] and they try to get a portion of it
[51:37] when we had this well i guess that would
[51:40] have been early 80s maybe
[51:42] mid 80s
[51:43] all the chemical
[51:45] that got into the ground and they're in
[51:47] the airport and all that there and
[51:48] people were becoming sick and and all
[51:51] that happened and that did happen
[51:54] but boy all the people did try to get a
[51:56] portion of it
[51:58] there's a couple guys at our work we we
[52:00] worked off of there off of valencia and
[52:03] he said are you going to put your name
[52:04] in that area i said well i've never
[52:06] lived there that was you know i never
[52:07] drank that water and never goes yeah but
[52:09] there's a chance of getting money go put
[52:11] your name in there
[52:13] you know that's what he said there's a
[52:14] chance of being receiving something out
[52:16] of it i said that's not the idea of that
[52:19] it's to restore to those who were hurt
[52:20] who had a loss
[52:22] and he was no i'm going to go over there
[52:24] and get what i can
[52:26] that's satan's eating
[52:28] but in god's kingdom it's his children
[52:31] that have been restored so just think
[52:33] about that restoration
[52:35] going back and and brother
[52:38] nathan talk got into that going back to
[52:41] to eden that fellowship that god had
[52:44] with his children that time together
[52:46] that that he desires and we talk about
[52:49] many times mention brother branham when
[52:50] he he's in that storm and it's coming up
[52:53] and and the lord is enjoying the
[52:55] fellowship
[52:57] coming down and spending time with a man
[53:00] because brother branham was a man
[53:02] he was human
[53:04] god called man no question about it and
[53:06] god is having fellowship with him and he
[53:08] says hey hey
[53:10] don't answer the door right now i'm
[53:12] having fellowship with you don't take
[53:13] that phone call i'm having fellowship
[53:15] with you
[53:16] how easy it is to get get
[53:19] pulled aside isn't it at times
[53:21] but he said just speak to the storm
[53:24] and let's continue to have fellowship
[53:26] and he desires that you know uh uh
[53:30] and and i know i just
[53:32] you can get distracted and then
[53:34] sometimes you know if you're at work and
[53:36] sometimes i'll you're listening to a
[53:38] song and then a phone call has to come
[53:40] through because you're at work
[53:42] you know you've got to stop and do that
[53:44] i understand those things but there are
[53:46] some times that none of this should
[53:48] matter when we're fellowshipping with
[53:50] god
[53:50] it should be our hearts because that's
[53:52] his heart's desire so
[53:54] we're going to go to psalms
[53:56] 139 and david
[54:00] a man after god's own heart
[54:06] david not a perfect man
[54:09] i i i love that the scripture shows both
[54:11] sides
[54:13] or else we'd have a total wrong
[54:15] impression of people
[54:17] whose names are in the scriptures
[54:20] if didn't show both sides
[54:24] while we read was peter's
[54:26] letters at the end
[54:29] or
[54:30] you know david's i could run
[54:33] leap overall run through a troop
[54:35] but david had his down days his hard
[54:37] days his his frustrated days
[54:41] you know
[54:42] in in if you go back and read in in the
[54:45] history and the recorded history of any
[54:47] servant of god they had their hard times
[54:50] they had their failures they had their
[54:52] days where they want to throw their
[54:54] hands up and maybe to throw a hands up
[54:56] and say i quit
[54:57] i'm not gonna do this no more
[54:59] brother green tells in his testimony
[55:02] after sister green and the girls left
[55:03] the house and he took his gun and he was
[55:06] walking out to the back to where the
[55:08] wash was and he was going to take his
[55:09] life
[55:12] down he said i've had enough i can't
[55:13] take this anymore
[55:15] and he said well that'll never happen to
[55:17] me if you live long enough in life there
[55:19] are times when you just had enough
[55:22] when it gets hard
[55:25] and and he talks about it he walks out
[55:28] and he gets ready to head over that way
[55:29] he said he'll take him a few days and
[55:31] they'll find me eventually and you know
[55:32] that was his reason that was his
[55:34] thinking
[55:35] brother adam reaches up to touch that
[55:36] line to take his life because of all
[55:39] that just gone through
[55:40] he was going to take his life took the
[55:42] gun why because we're human
[55:46] but i like that the scripture shows both
[55:48] sides
[55:50] and you say well i'll never come to be
[55:52] who he no he was he was human like us he
[55:55] had his time sometimes down times
[55:58] but
[55:59] the story there with brother green and
[56:01] i'm sure most of you have heard it but
[56:03] he starts to walk around and that little
[56:05] whirlwind comes up
[56:07] and he tries to walk around the tree and
[56:08] the whirlwind goes that way so he goes
[56:10] this way and it comes back this way and
[56:12] at two or three times before he realized
[56:14] uh
[56:16] that's not a happy name by accident
[56:18] and he talked to god there and he said
[56:20] well then then do some he said he felt
[56:22] when his nerves and everything got put
[56:24] back together
[56:27] he's still the same yesterday today
[56:29] forever
[56:31] there's there's testimonies and i
[56:33] couldn't hear the testimonies because
[56:35] they were not recorded but god still
[56:37] does things
[56:39] you know
[56:40] things that we've got to see things that
[56:42] we've got to witness things in our own
[56:43] personal lives
[56:45] and and you know he's jesus christ the
[56:47] same but here david a man after god's
[56:49] own heart
[56:52] but he still had his failures his down
[56:54] times i mean
[56:56] i pray that it hasn't happened to any of
[56:58] us here we had somebody put to death so
[57:00] we could have what they have
[57:02] but david did
[57:05] david had a man's life taken so he could
[57:07] have his wife
[57:10] boy would that make a great news story
[57:13] today
[57:15] david would be tried and everybody would
[57:17] be you know and
[57:19] some of the lawyers would try to get on
[57:20] his side so that they could make some
[57:22] money because that's what most of it is
[57:23] about
[57:25] and how would it go
[57:27] but david has something about in his
[57:29] heart which is an attribute of god
[57:32] they could say i'm sorry
[57:36] and that's why he was a man after god's
[57:38] own heart but david says here in verse 1
[57:41] starting in psalms 130 oh lord
[57:45] thou has searched me and known me
[57:49] thou knowest my down sitting and my
[57:51] uprising
[57:53] thou understand is my thought afar off
[57:58] you can't hide from god
[58:02] yeah god god can show someone
[58:05] exactly he can he can show somebody a
[58:07] dream
[58:10] uh uh and and and tell the dream back
[58:13] to the person
[58:15] we see it in scripture i was listening
[58:17] to the youth service part of the youth
[58:19] services that they had in south carolina
[58:22] brother watkins
[58:23] brother jason watkins ministered the
[58:25] first night
[58:27] and it was a wonderful service just just
[58:29] hear the testimonies of god and all but
[58:31] brother jason has has a gift in him to
[58:34] see a dream and to tell the dream back
[58:37] all that tells me is jesus christ is the
[58:39] same yesterday today and forever
[58:42] he hasn't changed he's still god
[58:45] and and and so here he says thou knowest
[58:48] my down sitting in my uprising thou
[58:50] understand if my thoughts are far off
[58:53] and that's why we put everything under
[58:55] the blood
[58:58] because sometimes our thoughts are not
[58:59] pure they're not good
[59:02] but we put everything under the blood
[59:04] okay
[59:06] thou come pass it to my path and my line
[59:08] down
[59:09] and are acquainted with all my ways
[59:12] now
[59:15] there she sit in the back over there i
[59:16] was underwear my wife i was looking over
[59:17] here she was there
[59:19] there is somebody who is acquainted with
[59:21] all my ways
[59:24] and
[59:25] she'll tell you they're all perfect
[59:26] they're all good they're all great
[59:29] why do you laugh
[59:31] those were my girls i think were
[59:32] laughing
[59:33] but no she knows she knows me good and
[59:35] well
[59:36] and acquainted with all my ways
[59:38] and and and um man
[59:41] i'm gonna get in trouble anyway so
[59:44] she does her best to fix me up to
[59:46] straighten me out too
[59:48] to make me a better person you know and
[59:50] i know that in her heart
[59:53] she doesn't want to embarrass me in
[59:54] other does she want to be embarrassed of
[59:56] me
[59:57] and it happens and things do happen
[1:00:01] but david is saying here look at this
[1:00:03] god is acquainted with your ways
[1:00:07] don't get nervous about it
[1:00:10] because he's made a provision
[1:00:13] and the reason he's acquainted with your
[1:00:14] is because he wore and walked in a body
[1:00:17] of flesh
[1:00:18] to understand your ways
[1:00:20] to understand what it is there says
[1:00:25] he says you keep watch over my steps and
[1:00:28] my sleep
[1:00:29] and have knowledge of all my ways
[1:00:33] for there is not a word in my tongue but
[1:00:36] thou but lo lord thou knowest it all
[1:00:39] together
[1:00:43] brother branham says say what the word
[1:00:45] says
[1:00:48] say what the word says
[1:00:51] because sometimes my words would not say
[1:00:54] what the word says
[1:00:55] lord i just don't understand how you
[1:00:57] could fix this i don't see how this
[1:00:59] situation could be better i don't
[1:01:01] understand but that's not what god's
[1:01:02] word says
[1:01:04] god's word says i can do all things
[1:01:06] through christ who strengthens me
[1:01:09] and this here david is saying that but
[1:01:12] but god has given us a key it through
[1:01:14] through a message it says there
[1:01:19] thou has beset behind beset me behind
[1:01:22] and before
[1:01:23] and laid thine hand upon me
[1:01:28] he says you're in front of me you're
[1:01:29] behind me you watch over me
[1:01:34] now sometimes we get a little nervous
[1:01:36] about that worry about it there's an eye
[1:01:38] watching you
[1:01:41] but i'm glad he watches over us
[1:01:44] i'm glad that he reaches down during our
[1:01:46] day and says don't do that son
[1:01:48] don't do that but honor you ought not to
[1:01:51] act that way
[1:01:52] you have a chance to make it right
[1:01:55] it's not held against you
[1:01:57] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[1:02:01] it is high
[1:02:02] i cannot attain unto it
[1:02:05] brother brandon was talking to brother
[1:02:07] green on that i believe the one of the
[1:02:09] trips when they were hunting in canada
[1:02:12] and brother brown tells brother green he
[1:02:14] says people would like to know the
[1:02:16] future
[1:02:19] people goes but they really don't want
[1:02:22] to
[1:02:25] and so he said like if i told you
[1:02:27] brother greene the next time you were
[1:02:29] going to get into a car there's going to
[1:02:33] be an accident you would never want to
[1:02:35] get in that car
[1:02:36] brother green talks about i said would
[1:02:37] this be the day would this you would
[1:02:39] live in fear
[1:02:41] you would live in nervousness
[1:02:43] you know what i'm saying
[1:02:44] have any child around her
[1:02:46] tell brother braham don't tell me don't
[1:02:48] tell me don't tell me
[1:02:49] let me live by faith
[1:02:52] let me walk saying god has it all under
[1:02:54] control and i'm trusting in him
[1:02:59] david knew he had been anointed king
[1:03:04] prophet aaron had come and anointed him
[1:03:06] the oil inning
[1:03:07] and i'm sure in david's mind at that
[1:03:09] time
[1:03:11] everything was just going to be awesome
[1:03:12] great no problems i'm going to be the
[1:03:14] king.
[1:03:17] chloe and asher are here and
[1:03:20] right now papa can do everything
[1:03:23] but they're going to get up a little bit
[1:03:25] get a little older and they're going to
[1:03:26] rise there's a lot of things papa can't
[1:03:27] do
[1:03:28] but i'm papa amos is daddy okay that's
[1:03:32] how we keep them separate
[1:03:33] they're gonna say you know papa can't do
[1:03:35] everything
[1:03:37] he's not as as big as as strong he's
[1:03:39] he's shrunken in time it's amazing how
[1:03:42] that stuff works
[1:03:44] but we have a god that has never failed
[1:03:47] a god who is is is is great from day one
[1:03:51] if i could say that to now
[1:03:53] an unfailing god he says
[1:03:58] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[1:04:00] it is high i cannot attain unto it he
[1:04:02] says i cannot i cannot
[1:04:05] apprehend in what manner thou dost so
[1:04:08] presently know all things
[1:04:13] another way to say that you know it all
[1:04:15] it's it's
[1:04:16] he goes and
[1:04:17] i just can't understand and comprehend
[1:04:19] that but i can trust him
[1:04:23] i can lay my confidence i can cast my
[1:04:25] cares upon him
[1:04:28] because he knows all things
[1:04:32] whether shall i go from thy spirit
[1:04:35] or whether shall i free flee from thy
[1:04:37] presence
[1:04:39] he says if i ascend up into heaven thou
[1:04:41] art there
[1:04:42] if i make my bed in hell behold thou art
[1:04:46] there
[1:04:48] he says you got it all covered
[1:04:50] from the top to the bottom from the side
[1:04:52] to the side in between and every angle
[1:04:54] and every part of it
[1:05:00] even there thy hand shall lead me
[1:05:04] and thy right hand shall hold me
[1:05:08] remember
[1:05:09] you're a child of god
[1:05:11] you're a part of god you're an
[1:05:12] expression of god
[1:05:16] me yes you
[1:05:19] if there's something in your heart that
[1:05:21] says amen to the word of god that's
[1:05:23] because there's a part of god responding
[1:05:26] that's what it is you have to understand
[1:05:28] it
[1:05:29] why can't i go out and be happy in the
[1:05:32] world
[1:05:34] because there's a part of god of me that
[1:05:35] doesn't like them
[1:05:37] that has kept you
[1:05:39] you've made your mistakes you've been in
[1:05:41] places you shouldn't have gone to but
[1:05:42] god has reached out and drawn you back
[1:05:45] because you're part of him
[1:05:48] if i say surely the darkness shall cover
[1:05:50] me even the night
[1:05:53] shall be light about me
[1:05:56] you can't hide from god
[1:06:00] he says darkness will cover me he says
[1:06:02] but even at night your light is greater
[1:06:04] than that he says
[1:06:06] yea the darkness height is not from thee
[1:06:10] but the night shineth as a day the
[1:06:12] darkness and the light are both alike to
[1:06:14] thee
[1:06:16] god doesn't have to take a flashlight
[1:06:19] put on night goggles do anything like
[1:06:21] that
[1:06:23] because he's god
[1:06:26] lord do you understand what i'm going
[1:06:28] through
[1:06:30] do you do have you had these feelings
[1:06:36] brother jordan i'm going to give you a
[1:06:37] scripture if you can put in
[1:06:39] psalms 115.
[1:06:42] let's look at that verse i believe it
[1:06:44] starts at verse 9.
[1:06:46] you've heard this but i just want to
[1:06:47] remind you
[1:06:49] when i asked the lord do you know my
[1:06:51] name do you know where i live
[1:06:53] sat down and the bible opens to this
[1:06:55] scripture
[1:06:56] o israel
[1:06:58] trust thou in the lord he is their help
[1:07:01] and their shield
[1:07:02] o house of aaron trust in the lord he is
[1:07:04] their help and their shield
[1:07:07] ye that fear the lord trust in the lord
[1:07:09] he is their help and their shield
[1:07:11] let's go one more
[1:07:15] the lord has been mindful of us he will
[1:07:17] bless us he will bless the house of
[1:07:18] israel he will bless the house of aaron
[1:07:23] in case you haven't figured out my
[1:07:24] name's aaron
[1:07:28] that's what god did for me
[1:07:30] and i think is that luke 1 34 i believe
[1:07:35] believe the other scripture
[1:07:40] no
[1:07:42] is elizabeth in here
[1:07:44] she knows where this what the scripture
[1:07:46] is it's in luke 1.
[1:07:50] i was thinking it was 34 but her name
[1:07:52] was elizabeth and she's from the house
[1:07:53] of aaron
[1:07:54] because she asked the lord do you know
[1:07:56] who i am and where i live
[1:07:58] and he took her right to that scripture
[1:08:03] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:08:05] forever
[1:08:06] okay there was in the days of herod
[1:08:09] the king of judea a certain priest named
[1:08:11] zacharias of the course of abya and his
[1:08:14] wife was of the daughters of aaron and
[1:08:16] her name was elizabeth
[1:08:20] when she asked lord do you know
[1:08:23] like you did for dad and he took it
[1:08:24] right to that scripture
[1:08:27] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:08:30] forever because
[1:08:32] he's mindful of you because you're a
[1:08:33] part of him
[1:08:37] i'm going back to psalms 139
[1:08:45] i think we're at verse 13.
[1:08:48] for thou has possessed my reigns
[1:08:52] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[1:08:56] and as i looked at that thou has
[1:08:58] possessed my reigns that's also our
[1:08:59] thoughts the word for reigns many times
[1:09:01] is our thoughts you you know
[1:09:04] what's going on in there
[1:09:07] and
[1:09:09] here's a testimony i'll share with you
[1:09:13] i have an older brother his name is
[1:09:15] alfredo lorenzo we call him fred
[1:09:20] and before he was born
[1:09:21] the lord showed my father what his son
[1:09:24] would look like
[1:09:26] and when he was born exactly
[1:09:30] of our brothers he's still able to do
[1:09:31] those things
[1:09:33] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:09:35] forever
[1:09:37] you know it's not another age it's not
[1:09:39] another time he's today
[1:09:42] and you're one of his
[1:09:45] he says
[1:09:47] you form my in inmost being you knit me
[1:09:51] together in my mother's womb you knew
[1:09:53] all about me david is saying
[1:09:55] i will praise thee for i am fearfully
[1:09:58] and wonderfully made
[1:09:59] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[1:10:03] knoweth right well
[1:10:07] david had come to a place in his life a
[1:10:09] position is that where he realized
[1:10:11] this is god's work
[1:10:15] and each one of us should have that same
[1:10:17] testimony
[1:10:18] this is god's work in my life
[1:10:23] not our ability to figure out not our
[1:10:26] ability to put it all together not
[1:10:28] because we were raised on the church pew
[1:10:30] not because we were under this ministry
[1:10:32] or that ministry but because you're a
[1:10:34] child of god
[1:10:36] and he says
[1:10:39] my substance was not hid from thee when
[1:10:41] i was made in
[1:10:43] in secret and curiously wrought in the
[1:10:45] lowest parts of the earth
[1:10:48] then i thine eyes did see my substance
[1:10:50] yet being unperfect
[1:10:52] and in thy book all my members were
[1:10:55] written
[1:10:56] which in continuance were fashioned
[1:10:58] when as yet there was none of them
[1:11:02] now let me just
[1:11:03] read another translation your eyes saw
[1:11:05] my unformed substance
[1:11:08] in your books all my days were recorded
[1:11:12] even those which were purposed before
[1:11:14] they had come in to being and that's the
[1:11:17] thought that i wanted to get here
[1:11:20] you were part of him
[1:11:23] the back part brother bram says in the
[1:11:24] back part of his mind
[1:11:26] you were a seed you were a thought of
[1:11:28] god
[1:11:29] david writes it in the word of god now
[1:11:31] could he explain that did he understand
[1:11:32] or was that by inspiration
[1:11:35] but god allowed it to be written in the
[1:11:37] word of god so that you and i could see
[1:11:38] it and i could receive from it
[1:11:40] lord you've known my days you know my
[1:11:43] days and if you know my days from that
[1:11:45] are past which i would say looking past
[1:11:47] you also know my day of today and you
[1:11:48] also know my tomorrow
[1:11:51] there's nothing that i need to fear but
[1:11:53] god has it in there in control and he
[1:11:55] says how precious also are thy thoughts
[1:11:58] unto me o god
[1:12:00] how great is the sum of them
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:07] what does he think about his children
[1:12:11] you know um
[1:12:14] i i was telling abby one day
[1:12:18] because it's so fun being with the
[1:12:19] grandchildren it's just
[1:12:21] they were at the house
[1:12:23] friday evening they wore me out because
[1:12:25] they want to play with papa they want to
[1:12:27] run around they want to throw the ball
[1:12:28] they want to catch they want to
[1:12:30] you know and and finally i just had to
[1:12:32] tell them no papa's tired now
[1:12:35] you know but i told abby one day if i
[1:12:37] would have known that the grandkids were
[1:12:38] going to be this much fun i would have
[1:12:40] had them and not you
[1:12:43] and
[1:12:44] she looked at me like i understand
[1:12:46] father and i love you no she didn't not
[1:12:47] really
[1:12:49] but you're not just we're just laughing
[1:12:50] about it because it's different raising
[1:12:52] the grandchildren
[1:12:54] because we spoil them really well and
[1:12:56] then send them home
[1:12:58] right grandpas
[1:13:00] but you know
[1:13:02] it's a joy to watch our other the kids
[1:13:04] growing up and and watching because now
[1:13:06] i can i can watch them grow up
[1:13:09] differently than i watch my children
[1:13:10] grow
[1:13:12] because in the growing up of my children
[1:13:14] i was working i was doing this i was you
[1:13:16] know you were so involved in just trying
[1:13:18] to get them grown up
[1:13:19] trying to get them to the next stage of
[1:13:20] life trying to get them on because
[1:13:22] you're teaching now the grandchildren
[1:13:23] you can have fun while they're growing
[1:13:25] up you can watch them you can it's
[1:13:27] different it's like watching it all over
[1:13:29] again but maybe from a little distant
[1:13:30] view
[1:13:33] we get the opportunity to read the
[1:13:34] scriptures and see what god has done
[1:13:37] see how god acted see how he performed
[1:13:40] here see what he did there and say lord
[1:13:43] like you did there then i
[1:13:45] can receive the same
[1:13:48] when you know the story and you've read
[1:13:50] the back of the book and you know you
[1:13:51] win it takes the fear out of the story
[1:13:56] if you ever read a mystery and you're
[1:13:57] really into the mystery
[1:13:59] or if you're watching something if
[1:14:01] you're watching it on tv or something in
[1:14:02] the mystery and somebody came up and
[1:14:04] said boo to you man you jump out of your
[1:14:06] seat
[1:14:07] because you were so intense something
[1:14:09] especially if you hadn't seen didn't
[1:14:10] know the results you're going
[1:14:12] but we've read the back of the book and
[1:14:13] we win
[1:14:15] there is no fear in it
[1:14:17] but there should be a thankfulness and a
[1:14:19] praise and a worship to god
[1:14:22] because he knew me and yet he loved me
[1:14:26] he cared for me he said if i
[1:14:30] how precious are they thought are thy
[1:14:31] thoughts unto me oh god
[1:14:33] how great is the sum of them
[1:14:35] if i should count them
[1:14:37] they are more in number than the sand
[1:14:40] when i awake i am still with thee
[1:14:45] think of that when i awake i am still
[1:14:48] with thee thou never does leave me you
[1:14:50] never you never walked away you were by
[1:14:53] my side when he said let's cross over to
[1:14:56] the other side
[1:14:58] do you think he didn't know the storm
[1:14:59] was coming
[1:15:02] do you think he didn't realize that they
[1:15:03] were going to be attacked
[1:15:05] saint was going to do all the good but
[1:15:07] he said i'm going to rest i'm going to
[1:15:09] lay down i'm going to rest
[1:15:11] he knew what was coming
[1:15:13] he knew he would speak peace be still
[1:15:15] over the situation
[1:15:18] it does it didn't faze him it didn't
[1:15:19] fear him
[1:15:21] now the disciples are having a wonderful
[1:15:23] time in this ship just just talking like
[1:15:25] when we hear a message or we've had a
[1:15:26] wonderful service or young people have
[1:15:28] gone to one of the youth camps and and
[1:15:30] we hear your conversation what a
[1:15:32] wonderful time god bless god did this
[1:15:34] everything
[1:15:36] so the disciples are having that kind of
[1:15:37] time in the ship
[1:15:39] brother branham calls it testimony in
[1:15:40] the sea
[1:15:42] as they're just oh wasn't it marvelous
[1:15:43] when he did what
[1:15:46] great when he did this
[1:15:48] not knowing what was coming up in a few
[1:15:50] minutes
[1:15:55] and then suddenly the wind begins to
[1:15:57] blow
[1:15:58] and the storm begins to there's a little
[1:16:00] bit of caps white caps and
[1:16:03] as it grows and it grows
[1:16:04] they begin to get a little nervous
[1:16:07] they just spent the last half an hour 45
[1:16:09] minutes talking about the wonderful
[1:16:11] things that god had done
[1:16:13] the marv did you see when he did that
[1:16:15] did you see how that happened did you
[1:16:17] see what he said here remember how he
[1:16:18] said this and did you see
[1:16:21] hey did you catch it were you here well
[1:16:23] you know they were just like us talking
[1:16:24] about seeing the things that god has
[1:16:26] done
[1:16:27] and then they get into a situation
[1:16:29] and the next thing
[1:16:30] master save us
[1:16:32] do you not even care why are you laying
[1:16:34] down to sleep and we're about to get
[1:16:37] and he gets up and he's like
[1:16:39] my boys have you learned anything
[1:16:42] have you forgotten the little testimony
[1:16:44] service you just had
[1:16:46] of what i'm able to do
[1:16:50] did that already go right out because
[1:16:52] the present situation often has gotten
[1:16:53] tough again
[1:16:55] we learn by our experiences
[1:16:57] we grow by the things we experience with
[1:16:59] god
[1:17:01] you know
[1:17:02] as you learn in in work in your job
[1:17:05] whatever you do
[1:17:06] if i do this
[1:17:08] and and i do it like this it doesn't
[1:17:10] work
[1:17:11] it doesn't come out right
[1:17:12] but i've learned that if i do this and
[1:17:14] this
[1:17:15] you know by experience you begin to
[1:17:17] learn those things
[1:17:19] so
[1:17:20] here they are
[1:17:22] and he gets up gets the bottom head
[1:17:24] he didn't look around and the bible
[1:17:26] didn't record him looking around says oh
[1:17:27] my what's going on here what are we
[1:17:28] doing he just walked over the ball of
[1:17:30] ship and he said peace be still
[1:17:34] and there was peace and they marveled
[1:17:39] sometimes you stop and think about it i
[1:17:40] said lord they were just like us
[1:17:44] you know i just received the blessing of
[1:17:45] the lord and a situation comes up and i
[1:17:47] say lord where are you
[1:17:49] and he says
[1:17:51] what just happened didn't you just
[1:17:52] didn't i just say am i not the same did
[1:17:55] i change already
[1:17:57] david says
[1:17:59] if i should count them
[1:18:02] they are more in number than the sand
[1:18:04] when i awake i am still with me with he
[1:18:06] said nothing changes
[1:18:10] though i go through this trouble though
[1:18:12] i am tempted and tried nothing changes
[1:18:14] you're still a child of god
[1:18:17] he still watches over you he still cares
[1:18:19] for you he still takes care of you
[1:18:23] and then david finishes on 23-24
[1:18:28] he says search me o god
[1:18:30] and know my heart
[1:18:31] try me and know my thoughts
[1:18:34] and see if there being any wicked way in
[1:18:36] me
[1:18:37] and lead me
[1:18:39] in the way everlasting
[1:18:41] oh that that would be our heart every
[1:18:43] time lord
[1:18:44] search me
[1:18:45] look me over
[1:18:47] let's be sure that everything is right
[1:18:49] everything is how it should be
[1:18:51] always
[1:18:53] always lord
[1:18:54] a man
[1:18:55] after
[1:18:56] god's own heart
[1:19:02] a man i did say that right a man
[1:19:06] born of flesh
[1:19:07] with troubles and trials and heartaches
[1:19:09] and things
[1:19:11] a man after god's own heart
[1:19:15] that's what the scripture would say
[1:19:17] and it hasn't changed
[1:19:20] do we need to deal with the situation
[1:19:21] there
[1:19:24] okay all right there's the sirens and
[1:19:26] some people going out just making sure
[1:19:27] there was nothing there
[1:19:31] he's still god
[1:19:32] and you're still his children
[1:19:34] and he still cares for you
[1:19:37] job said it this way though god save me
[1:19:39] yet i will trust him
[1:19:42] i shall then come forth as go
[1:19:45] through all of that
[1:19:48] but but
[1:19:49] but brother aaron i'm human
[1:19:51] so am i
[1:19:53] and we have our days
[1:19:54] lord where are you
[1:19:56] and he comes draw and he reminds you
[1:19:59] that he cares if the musicians would
[1:20:01] come
[1:20:02] he reminds you what you mean to him and
[1:20:05] why he went through what he went through
[1:20:07] i wrote i love the way david wrote those
[1:20:10] pen that out because he shows his
[1:20:12] humanity
[1:20:14] but he also realizes what he means to
[1:20:17] god and what god means to him
[1:20:19] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:20:22] forever
[1:20:23] let's bow our heads
[1:20:27] lord we've been redeemed bought with the
[1:20:29] price
[1:20:32] you gave your all
[1:20:36] from the day there
[1:20:38] you had set your face
[1:20:40] towards jerusalem
[1:20:43] because you
[1:20:44] knew
[1:20:46] what was about to take place
[1:20:50] in a what we would call in a space of
[1:20:52] time
[1:20:55] you had you had
[1:20:58] it created
[1:21:00] had made
[1:21:02] man
[1:21:03] on this earth
[1:21:06] in a garden of eden
[1:21:08] to to
[1:21:10] to help
[1:21:13] feel that need that desire you had for
[1:21:15] fellowship lord
[1:21:18] to walk with him to talk with them
[1:21:21] to spend the afternoons and the evenings
[1:21:23] with them and enjoying the fellowship
[1:21:25] lord
[1:21:27] but you also knew that there would be a
[1:21:28] fall
[1:21:30] it didn't catch you by surprise when you
[1:21:31] cried out adam adam where art thou
[1:21:34] you knew where adam was and you knew
[1:21:35] what happened
[1:21:37] you made provision for them
[1:21:39] because within you there was that desire
[1:21:42] to be a savior
[1:21:43] to be a healer to be a friend to be a
[1:21:46] comfort it was all part of you lord and
[1:21:48] it was going to be expressed lord jesus
[1:21:51] so you set your face towards calvary
[1:21:54] because that time had come
[1:21:57] when this was going to be fulfilled
[1:22:00] you went through such a crucifixion such
[1:22:03] a trial such a hard time you were
[1:22:05] bruised you were broken you were
[1:22:07] bloodied you were you were smitten you
[1:22:09] were they did everything to you lord
[1:22:13] and you took it lord
[1:22:14] because you wanted
[1:22:16] that fellowship back with your children
[1:22:20] you cried out at his finish you had
[1:22:22] already cried out my fault my god my god
[1:22:24] why hast thou forsaken me you understood
[1:22:26] the loneliness the feeling of despair
[1:22:29] so that you could be touched by the
[1:22:30] filling our feelings lord jesus
[1:22:34] and then you said i commend my spirit in
[1:22:36] your hands and you gave up
[1:22:39] but three days later you arose
[1:22:44] lord wouldn't it all seem hopeless we
[1:22:45] know the disciples were walking away
[1:22:47] they had turned their back and they
[1:22:48] thought it was over lord
[1:22:50] but the greatest victory had just taken
[1:22:53] place lord the restoration the
[1:22:55] redemption the fellowship that was
[1:22:57] coming back
[1:22:59] between you and your children lord
