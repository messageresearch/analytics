[12:09] [Music]
[12:11] I have a tiny change purse that I put my
[12:14] keys into it's just big enough about a
[12:17] couple of weeks ago I lost my keys I
[12:19] emptied the little coin purse of
[12:21] everything
[12:22] and looked everywhere I asked God to
[12:24] please help me recover my keys there
[12:27] were no copies of two of them a few days
[12:29] later I opened my coin purse and there
[12:32] were my keys taking up the whole Space
[12:36] thank you so that's not by accident
[12:39] that's the God we serve who it was
[12:42] mindful of us watches over his children
[12:44] cares for us and
[12:47] you know he asked us to believe and to
[12:49] ask and to trust in him
[12:51] and sometimes we we might say well it's
[12:54] just a minor thing it's just it's just a
[12:56] simple thing but that's what encourages
[12:58] you it's just that simple thought that
[13:00] simple thing that doing so if you have a
[13:04] need and say Lord remember me remember
[13:06] this need maybe those that are on
[13:09] listening in or or watching live same
[13:13] there at home wherever they might be
[13:16] say Lord be mindful
[13:18] whatever it is that we have let's just
[13:20] bow our heads Lord we we come Lord
[13:22] Wednesday
[13:24] evening Lord we set this time aside for
[13:26] service Lord and
[13:28] sometimes maybe it just becomes a
[13:30] routine it's Wednesday I go to church
[13:32] but Lord tonight let it be different
[13:35] in the sense Lord that we come believing
[13:37] because you said you would be with us
[13:38] Lord you'd meet with us so
[13:40] let us come into your presence with that
[13:42] expectation Lord
[13:45] father we we confess that we're of no
[13:47] good and nothing good that we can offer
[13:49] you but you bet us come so we're coming
[13:51] today Lord we can come into your
[13:53] presence Lord and enjoy the fellowship
[13:55] with you as you minister to us as we

[14:07] and we thank you even for the
[14:09] testimonies that we heard Lord that
[14:10] you're Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[14:12] today and forever Lord
[14:15] and we appreciate that today amen
[14:18] brother Peter if you would put Psalms
[14:21] 116 verses 1 through 8.
[14:24] I don't know sometimes I just opened the
[14:27] scriptures and let's see where they fall
[14:31] and it's just the way God does things
[14:33] sometimes
[14:34] I just fell on that Psalms 116. I love
[14:37] the Lord because he has heard my voice
[14:39] and my supplications
[14:42] because he hath inclined his ear unto me
[14:44] therefore will I call upon him as long
[14:47] as I live
[14:49] the Sorrows of death Compass me and the
[14:51] Pains of Hell get hold upon me I found
[14:55] trouble and sorrow
[14:56] [Music]
[14:57] then I called upon I called upon the
[15:00] name of the Lord O Lord I beseech thee
[15:02] deliver my soul
[15:04] gracious is the Lord and righteous yet
[15:07] our God is merciful
[15:09] the Lord preserves the simple I was
[15:12] brought low and he helped me
[15:14] return unto thy rest O my soul for the
[15:17] Lord has dealt bountifully with thee
[15:20] for thou has delivered my soul from
[15:22] Death mine eyes from tears and my feet
[15:24] from falling and that was David crying
[15:27] about all of us could say the same thing
[15:29] Lord you've been gracious you've been
[15:31] good you've been wonderful amen

[32:58] be a sweet place a wonderful place
[33:01] amen come go with me that's my plans how
[33:04] many plan to be there
[33:06] how many have made their reservations
[33:07] made their heart ready for that amen all
[33:11] the time so
[33:12] tonight we're going to listen to a
[33:14] message God's provided approach to
[33:16] Divine Fellowship
[33:19] God provides a way he makes a way
[33:23] now it's up to you what are you gonna do
[33:25] with it you know sometimes it's hard to
[33:27] believe when somebody says it's free you
[33:30] can go we kind of we get kind of that
[33:33] really what's the trick behind it what's
[33:35] that you know you get something in the
[33:37] mail you open it up and says oh you get
[33:39] a free dinner and then you keep reading
[33:40] because there's got to be a catch to it
[33:42] you know
[33:43] but God said this is what I'm going to
[33:45] do for you because I love you and you're
[33:48] my own so as we stand
[33:52] it's right about it's right at 60
[33:54] Minutes long and
[33:56] has listened to it today
[33:58] and it ends very abruptly so I think
[34:01] maybe that's where the tape cut off but
[34:02] brother Brandon was just speaking then
[34:03] it stops so
[34:05] I told sister Martha you can't wait till
[34:07] it sounds like he's ending when I come
[34:09] up it's about ready to end because it
[34:10] just ends different
[34:12] but I appreciate that he's provided a
[34:14] way for us
[34:16] to enter into his presence amen and
[34:19] fellowship with me that's where life is
[34:21] only believe all things are possible how
[34:25] many knows that to be true all things
[34:27] are possible amen sometimes it it may
[34:30] look hopeless it may look how can it
[34:34] just be but God makes a way that's why
[34:36] David said what he said in that Psalms
[34:37] there because of you I'm alive today and
[34:40] that's the only reason why they mean
[34:42] oh
[34:44] Maybe
[34:48] oh
[34:50] baby
[34:54] all things are possible
[34:59] oh
[35:05] maybe

[36:42] days as Pentecostal believers
[36:46] as a worshiper of the one true and
[36:49] living God
[36:50] how we thank thee today that thou has
[36:52] made for us a refuge in a time of
[36:55] trouble
[36:58] a tower that we can run into and be safe
[37:03] when the storms are raging and the winds
[37:06] are high
[37:08] the lightning flashing yet we can rest
[37:11] just as surely on the promise of God as
[37:15] a baby would feel secured in his
[37:17] mother's arms
[37:19] we're so glad to have that
[37:21] we thank thee for this
[37:24] Full Gospel Fellowship of these
[37:27] businessmen
[37:29] for their stand in the last day of
[37:32] uniting the body of the Lord Jesus
[37:35] together

[37:40] will rise constantly until we see the
[37:45] coming of the Lord
[37:48] we pray for brother or Roberts
[37:52] your Noble servant
[37:55] and as we walk into this building
[37:57] tonight and see what the faith of one
[38:00] man can do
[38:03] we thank thee for Him Father

[38:19] pour out your spirit upon us tonight and
[38:22] correct us and bring us into a a greater
[38:26] Fellowship than we've ever known before
[38:28] with Jesus Christ
[38:30] granted Lord for we asked it in Jesus
[38:33] name and for his sake amen
[38:40] I want to take the subject tonight
[38:44] um
[38:45] God's provided approach to Divine
[38:49] Fellowship take that far enough subject
[38:52] if I should call it that
[38:55] God's provided approach to Divine
[38:59] Fellowship
[39:04] all day long uh everything seemed to be
[39:08] different this certain day
[39:11] I don't know looks like there's times
[39:14] like that comes in life when people just
[39:17] begin to see things a little different
[39:19] than what they've once seen them
[39:23] this has been an unusual day the weather
[39:25] even seems strange
[39:28] eyes noticing as far my first Bible I
[39:32] ever knew was Grand Old Mother Nature
[39:36] you just follow that you won't be too
[39:39] far off the road
[39:40] watching nature how it works
[39:44] it was that that led me to God knowing
[39:46] that there was a god
[39:48] watching nature
[39:51] I was coming down the mountain looking
[39:54] out upon the beautiful Lake ambe Gog
[39:57] which leads out into the Androscoggin
[40:00] river
[40:01] I noticed the robins all seem to be
[40:05] getting together
[40:07] and giving their little chirping songs
[40:10] once in a while you would hear the snort
[40:12] from the male deer and
[40:15] looked like if they were getting ready
[40:17] for something it was coming winter and
[40:19] they were getting ready to yard
[40:22] as I plowed on down through the
[40:24] underbrush to meet my friend Warwick
[40:26] parked a canoe
[40:28] there was a
[40:30] he was sitting on a log waiting
[40:33] and I noticed out into the lake on baygo
[40:37] such a great
[40:39] swarm of ducks I've never seen so many
[40:42] Harley in my life
[40:44] and Bert my friend said what do you make
[40:48] of that Billy I said well they are
[40:50] getting ready to fly south
[40:54] I said that's the reason that sun set
[40:56] this afternoon did you notice how before
[40:59] it peeped over the mountain how that it
[41:02] looked so red
[41:03] it's getting ready to snow Bert and some
[41:07] kind of a special instinct that God has
[41:11] put in animal life
[41:13] to make ready to get ready to move
[41:16] flying time comes
[41:19] I said did you notice the birds today
[41:21] and uh the robins and so forth they're
[41:24] getting ready for their winter flight
[41:26] also
[41:27] the deers are getting ready to yard
[41:29] because that there's coming a storm
[41:33] as we dipped our panels into the uh Lake
[41:38] and started down I believe ever duck all
[41:41] up and down daniscoggin river had come
[41:44] into Lake umbagog getting ready for the
[41:47] flight
[41:48] and all of the quacking only as ducks
[41:52] can do
[41:53] just carrying on and Bert said what do
[41:55] you think they're talking about Billy I
[41:58] said they're having a little time of
[41:59] Fellowship
[42:01] before the flight
[42:03] and then is this Indian friend of mine
[42:06] and I moved on down the river to our
[42:09] certain camp
[42:11] and the moon begin to get pale as we
[42:13] knew the storm was coming in our paddles
[42:15] begin to make a little ruffle in the
[42:17] water then as the waves begin to rise
[42:20] I thought on this
[42:23] surely sometime before we take the
[42:27] flight
[42:29] we'll have a time of Fellowship when all
[42:32] churches can come together on one ground
[42:35] and all have a time of fellowship before
[42:38] we take the flight
[42:42] 10 years passed I was a local Baptist
[42:45] pastor at that time at Jefferson villain
[42:47] and his years passed on I come into this
[42:50] great
[42:52] Full Gospel businessman's Fellowship
[42:57] then I began to notice that how that
[42:59] they would
[43:01] spend their money and go from place to
[43:04] place and meet Across the Nation yes and
[43:07] the world
[43:08] and when they come together they were no
[43:12] differences among them they were not one
[43:15] saying I belonged to this certain
[43:17] assembly in another a certain assembly
[43:19] they all had things in common
[43:23] so I thought that must have been what I
[43:25] was thinking of that night
[43:27] of a fellowship of getting together
[43:29] before the flight starts
[43:32] now I've noticed Sam there in this great
[43:36] Pentecostal move that did not seem to be
[43:39] any condemnation among them
[43:42] you mean in a hotel room they'll throw
[43:44] their arms around one another right in
[43:46] the face of the other celebrity or
[43:49] whatever it is and hug each other and
[43:51] praise the Lord and cry a little while
[43:53] and Shout a little while and just act
[43:56] like they do anywhere else
[43:58] and I thought you know that's real
[44:00] that's there's something about that the
[44:03] women likewise it just seemed to be a
[44:06] great Fellowship
[44:09] and I wondered wonder what causes that
[44:12] and why is it we all can't do that why
[44:16] is it all people all human beings can't
[44:18] feel that way
[44:20] no condemnation just as free as you can
[44:24] be I thought well why can't everyone be
[44:27] that way
[44:28] now I believe we can but there is
[44:32] and the reason that we do that first is
[44:35] because that there's something in the
[44:38] human life that desires that something
[44:41] that calls for it
[44:43] today on the plane coming from
[44:45] Louisville down here I'll taking me two
[44:47] and a half hours of flying and take me
[44:49] all day to make it delayed planes
[44:52] and maybe God had a hand in it when I
[44:54] got on it Louisville there was a young
[44:56] lady got on the plane and sat down by me
[45:00] and she said you mind if I sit here I
[45:02] said not at all
[45:03] and as we went on they were serving uh
[45:07] lunch on the plane
[45:09] and I prayed well and she said are you a
[45:13] minister I said yes ma'am I am
[45:16] and she said I am a believer too and she
[45:19] told me of her certain denomination I
[45:21] said that's nice and I noticed we had a
[45:25] little package of cigarettes on the
[45:27] plane and uh lost to see what she'd do
[45:30] about it so as soon as the dinner was
[45:33] over she began undoing that package of
[45:36] cigarettes and she fumbled one a little
[45:38] bit and she
[45:40] stuck it towards your mouth and she took
[45:42] it down again and after a while she lit
[45:44] it up she said you don't mind if I smoke
[45:47] I said you don't mind if I tell you I do
[45:50] I said
[45:53] I said I I do because she said why I
[45:58] said I can't understand why a nice
[46:00] little lady with a personality that
[46:02] you've got would have to do a thing like
[46:05] that she said oh I get satisfaction out
[46:09] of it I said that's only a
[46:12] substitutionary satisfaction
[46:15] if you would just take what I tell you
[46:18] and would turn your life completely to
[46:22] God there's something that you're
[46:24] missing and you're trying to make
[46:25] cigarettes fill up that longing that's
[46:28] in your heart
[46:30] give you a false satisfaction which will
[46:32] soon give you cancer or degrade your
[46:34] body and you'll be gone and I said God
[46:38] made a person to thirst to thirst after
[46:41] him and then if they do not accept that
[46:44] then the devil gives them a false
[46:47] conception of pleasure and they try to
[46:50] satisfy it with the things of the world
[46:53] she'd made about two little drawers off
[46:55] the cigarette she said I'm 22 years old
[46:58] she said my engaged boyfriend is 32 that
[47:03] he told me I've been overseas for three
[47:06] months he begged me to smoke no more and
[47:08] she said this is the first time that I
[47:10] have smoked missing the plane and she
[47:13] said sir I'll take this promise now
[47:17] she put the cigarette out got
[47:21] man God loves to fellowship with his
[47:25] creature in the Garden of Eden we are
[47:28] told that when man walked in the
[47:30] uprightness of God
[47:32] God came down in the cool of the evening
[47:34] and fellowship with his children
[47:37] then one day there was a voice came up
[47:41] in the presence of God and said
[47:43] though your loved ones your children has
[47:47] fallen and they have sin that have did
[47:50] that which was wrong
[47:53] you know God didn't just select some
[47:56] Angel to go down and look it over to see
[47:58] if it was so or not are a certain cherub
[48:01] in all the heavens but God came his
[48:04] self-crying Adam Where Art Thou
[48:09] God himself come crying for his Lost
[48:12] Child
[48:13] when he found him hiding in the bushes
[48:15] behind sold fig leaves
[48:18] he said who told you you were naked and
[48:20] he could not come out and have
[48:22] Fellowship no more with God
[48:25] now if there is a True Fellowship
[48:30] and God is love and love Demands a
[48:36] fellowship like the young couple
[48:39] when the boy meets the girl
[48:41] and he says to her he thinks she's so
[48:43] pretty and and she's a fond of him they
[48:48] want to have Fellowship a real
[48:50] Fellowship but before they can have this
[48:54] Fellowship there has to be an agreement
[48:56] before they can enter into wedding
[48:59] wedlock there has to be an agreement for
[49:03] this certain fellowship and it's based
[49:06] upon the truces of our pledges to each
[49:09] other and then holy wedlock and then we
[49:12] enter into a lifelong Fellowship
[49:17] but before we can enter into that
[49:20] Fellowship there has to be a an
[49:22] agreement first
[49:24] and when Fellowship was broken between
[49:26] God and man there had to be some sort of
[49:31] an agreement
[49:33] some sort of an arrangements to restore
[49:36] again that lost Fellowship
[49:40] and God
[49:42] found the plan and it was through the
[49:46] blood of an innocent victim
[49:49] that God restored man back to fellowship
[49:53] with him again
[49:55] there's been many substitutes tried Adam
[49:57] tried it
[49:59] we've tried to educate people to it
[50:01] we've tried all different forms but
[50:04] there's nothing that brings men back
[50:07] into fellowship with his maker but the
[50:10] blood of his son Jesus Christ
[50:13] it's the only appropriation God has is
[50:16] the blood
[50:18] an innocent victim died for a guilty
[50:21] person that brought the fellowship back
[50:24] to God and man again then Adam covered
[50:27] by this Blood could stand in the
[50:29] presence of God and worship again oh I
[50:32] love that there's something about it
[50:34] when you speak of blood blood has life
[50:37] without the shedding of blood there's no
[50:39] remission of sins
[50:41] you can have everything in the world you
[50:44] can have any kind of a thing that you
[50:46] wished you any object to worship any
[50:48] Creed to live by but you can never come
[50:51] into Fellowship Divine fellowship with
[50:54] God until first you come under the blood
[50:56] that's God's holy and ordained and
[51:00] provided way for our human beings to
[51:03] fellowship with him through the blood of
[51:05] his son the Lord Jesus Christ that was
[51:08] God's plan it's still God's plan it will
[51:11] forever be God's plan no other plan but
[51:15] through the shedding of the blood
[51:18] the Old Testament and the journey Israel
[51:21] from their homelands
[51:24] going over or out of Egypt rather going
[51:26] to their homelands on their way over God
[51:30] made a preparation
[51:33] through the blood
[51:35] we want to thank now on the 19th Chapter
[51:38] of numbers God told Moses and Aaron go
[51:42] take a red heifer now the symbol of red
[51:46] many times is a bad color or danger but
[51:49] red also means an atonement
[51:54] go get a red heifer
[51:56] all red not a spot owner she represented
[52:01] of course Christ and this heifer must
[52:05] never have a yoke up on its neck
[52:08] if it ever was yoked then it is it's
[52:11] condemned it must not be yoked up with
[52:14] the world that's the way the church is
[52:17] today Christ when he came he never yoked
[52:20] himself with the world he stayed with
[52:23] God and he was not yoked up at the world
[52:26] the church that worships God today is
[52:29] yoked with Christ
[52:31] under the blood
[52:34] then we find that this heifer wants to
[52:37] be killed in the evening time in the
[52:40] presence of all of the church Ella easer
[52:44] wants to catch her blood upon his
[52:46] fingers and walk towards the door of the
[52:48] Tabernacle and sprinkled the blood seven
[52:51] times or otherwise put seven Stripes
[52:55] over the door of the congregation
[52:58] then the heifer was to be burned
[53:01] hoofs horns hide flesh and all
[53:06] and in this burning of the heifer it was
[53:09] to be mixed with Joseph
[53:13] yes if I'll be the better word fart
[53:15] pronounce that way hyssa
[53:18] scarlet and Cedarwood
[53:21] Scarlet in the scripture was wool off of
[53:26] a Rams back that was dyed red
[53:31] representing the lamb that was slain
[53:34] before the foundation of the world
[53:37] was to be mixed into this because this
[53:40] would be the Waters of Separation to
[53:43] cleanse the unclean worshiper that he
[53:46] might be presented in the presence of
[53:48] God
[53:49] what are we basing trying to find the
[53:53] real true way to genuine fellowship with
[53:56] with God
[53:58] we've tried to do all kinds of things to
[54:01] make it educate organized but there's
[54:03] only one divine plan that's the blood
[54:06] outside the blood there's no Fellowship
[54:08] there's not even cleansing of sin until
[54:11] we get to the blood now
[54:14] notice then this wall died red
[54:19] represented Abel's Ram that he offered
[54:23] on the Block of stone in the garden
[54:26] outside the Garden of Eden for his sins
[54:29] what we took its little head and held it
[54:32] back and hacked it with a piece of rock
[54:34] I don't suppose they had any knives or
[54:37] lances in that date and hacked its
[54:40] little throat until the blood gushed out
[54:43] all over this little wolf and it died
[54:46] bleeding crying
[54:49] it symbolized the Son of God some 4 000
[54:55] years later hanging on the cross
[54:57] bleeding his locks bleeding and he was
[55:00] dying crying my God my God why is I
[55:05] forsaken me
[55:06] that was a Scarlet that was put into the
[55:09] Waters of separation
[55:13] and then Cedarwood
[55:15] Cedarwood is red over White
[55:18] red through red makes life you look
[55:22] through something red add something red
[55:23] it makes it white assemble that when God
[55:27] looks through
[55:29] the red blood of his son the Lord Jesus
[55:32] at our red Scarlet sea and say become
[55:36] white as snow Wash Me In The Blood and
[55:40] I'll be as white as snow
[55:42] no other thing could you could you ever
[55:44] have
[55:45] I appreciate the old Salvation Army song
[55:48] oh precious is the flow that makes me
[55:52] white as snow no other Fountain no
[55:56] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[55:59] that's the fountain that's filled with
[56:02] blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins when
[56:06] Sinners plunged beneath the flood lose
[56:08] all their guilty stains
[56:11] the red to red
[56:14] and then
[56:17] I found searching to see what his
[56:20] supplies hyssop is just a common weed
[56:23] found in Egypt and all so it's found in
[56:27] Palestine and sometimes it grows out of
[56:31] the walls where the dirt it's just a
[56:33] common ordinary weed with a little blade
[56:35] on it with a little white flower
[56:37] and history was always used
[56:40] to sprinkle the blood
[56:43] in the days of the Passover
[56:45] Moses commanded to take discipline dip
[56:49] it in the blood and
[56:50] splashing upon the door posting on the
[56:52] little zip playing of the blood and
[56:55] hyssop being just a common weed in this
[56:58] Great Waters of Separation represents
[57:01] common faith
[57:03] the believer coming must not be some
[57:07] Supernatural oh I don't know what some
[57:10] kind of a fella that's so highly
[57:11] educated to leave
[57:13] hey God knows all more than Webster does
[57:16] and he doesn't have to be any great
[57:18] Theologian he just has to use common
[57:22] Faith the hyssop pick it up anywhere and
[57:26] it was all mixed together and burned
[57:30] and then it was kept outside the courts
[57:33] that the unclean before he could come
[57:36] into the fellowship I don't remember
[57:41] God
[57:42] always did and never will any other
[57:46] place but meet men under the blood
[57:50] that's the only place you have
[57:53] fellowship with God is under the blood
[57:56] you're only approaching until you get to
[57:58] that place all Israel gathered were the
[58:02] sacrificial lamb was killed and under
[58:06] that blood they had Fellowship outside
[58:08] the blood there was no Fellowship always
[58:11] has been God's provided program
[58:15] the meat man under the blood
[58:19] it's cause he looks at men through the
[58:21] blood and sees him white outside of that
[58:23] he's a sinner nothing you couldn't clean
[58:25] yourself there's nothing you could ever
[58:27] do to make yourself any better you
[58:29] cannot reforms and so forth do what just
[58:33] like a leopard kind of Licky spots off
[58:35] of him it just makes it brighter and all
[58:37] of our self-made ideas that we're just
[58:40] as good as the next man we are not until
[58:42] we've come beneath the blood of the Lord
[58:44] Jesus Christ
[58:46] tried that's God's only place of meeting
[58:49] man under the blood
[58:52] then when Israel come to the place of
[58:55] worship all going at a unclean person
[58:58] come first he had to come to the outer
[59:01] courts and this Blood of this water of
[59:05] separation
[59:06] which is called by the New Testament we
[59:09] are Washed by the Water of the word the
[59:12] Waters of separation is a word of God
[59:15] Faith cometh by hearing and this man
[59:19] coming in was sprinkled with this Waters
[59:23] of separation
[59:25] then like the sinner comes in and
[59:27] listens to the gospel
[59:30] he begins to realize condemnation he's a
[59:33] sinner he realizes that in this water
[59:36] separation is the Scarlet
[59:39] someone died for him an innocent
[59:41] substitute to bring him into
[59:43] worship and relationship with God again
[59:47] he realizes that he's out of the way by
[59:49] the preaching of the word
[59:52] I say this that the gospel yet in its
[59:55] Simplicity preached in the power of the
[59:58] blood is the greatest drawing card the
[1:00:00] world has ever known
[1:00:02] they're hungry today for power
[1:00:05] I've seen some time ago where a certain
[1:00:07] gasoline under a certain condition of a
[1:00:10] certain uh stiff leg would lift the
[1:00:13] Sphinx off the ground two foot and they
[1:00:15] were bragging about their gasoline us
[1:00:17] reading the magazine on a plane and I
[1:00:19] threw it back and said yes but praise
[1:00:22] God I know something more powerful than
[1:00:24] that that two thoughts of the blood of
[1:00:26] Jesus Christ so if the sinner that's
[1:00:28] lost and
[1:00:30] take a prostitute off the street and
[1:00:32] make a sight out of her take a conquer
[1:00:34] out of the gutters out there and make a
[1:00:36] saint of God a preacher of the Gospel
[1:00:39] that's what's the power of one drop of
[1:00:42] the blood of the Lord Jesus amen
[1:00:45] that's what the world needs no power
[1:00:47] today
[1:00:49] God's
[1:00:50] got a provided way
[1:00:52] and when the Gentile are the unclean
[1:00:56] person desired fellowship with God the
[1:00:59] first thing he had to do was come first
[1:01:02] to the Waters of Separation then be
[1:01:06] sprinkled
[1:01:07] now what does that represent or type the
[1:01:11] believer today the man that wants to
[1:01:14] believe comes to the church and listens
[1:01:17] to the gospel Christ died for sinners in
[1:01:21] their
[1:01:21] the red the Scarlet the Hasa fan he
[1:01:25] applies that with common faith that uh
[1:01:29] that a two-year-old child could use just
[1:01:32] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:35] there's so much of it today there's so
[1:01:37] many of us if someone says what can I do
[1:01:40] to be safe quit your line quit your
[1:01:42] stealing quit your smoking quit your
[1:01:43] drinking I believe they should do that
[1:01:45] too but that doesn't answer his question
[1:01:47] you're telling him what not to do he
[1:01:49] won't know what to do
[1:01:52] Paul said to the Philippine sailor he
[1:01:54] never told him to put up your sword and
[1:01:56] do all this another he said believe on
[1:01:59] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[1:02:01] saved thy and thy house
[1:02:05] please have faith how can I have that
[1:02:08] faith brother Brandon it's just as
[1:02:10] simple as reaching it in the house of
[1:02:12] the plow the blood
[1:02:13] believe it for yourself believe that
[1:02:16] Christ died for you believe that he was
[1:02:18] the innocent one that died in your place
[1:02:19] as a sinner and guilty same applies by
[1:02:23] Divine Healing just simple Faith to take
[1:02:25] him at his word or if they tried to
[1:02:28] complicate it to try to make it so great
[1:02:30] that's why the great Revival broke out
[1:02:32] in England then his church had it so
[1:02:34] complicated only they're educated could
[1:02:37] understand him and God when the church
[1:02:39] gets in that condition God always sends
[1:02:41] a Revival of Simplicity and breaks a
[1:02:43] thing to pieces
[1:02:45] it's right
[1:02:47] that's what we need today is the
[1:02:51] simpleness
[1:02:52] that's what the nation needs today is
[1:02:54] the Simplicity of faith in Christ
[1:02:58] to surrender themselves
[1:03:02] unselfishly with their whole heart soul
[1:03:05] and mind and all they are to the Lord
[1:03:07] Jesus just simple you don't have to
[1:03:10] learn nothing at all just believe that
[1:03:12] Jesus died to give you the blessing that
[1:03:15] it's yours by faith as soon as you pick
[1:03:17] up the house of faith and apply the
[1:03:19] blood something happens in every man's
[1:03:21] heart or a woman that does that
[1:03:23] hey man I feel religious right now
[1:03:27] yes sir because I know that that is the
[1:03:30] truth if it saved me it'll save anybody
[1:03:35] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:37] here's some years ago they had a
[1:03:39] religions of the world met I was reading
[1:03:41] in a book the address lady macby from
[1:03:44] Oklahoma here there's rest in our own
[1:03:45] might have been a toss or one of these
[1:03:47] places she was running through the
[1:03:49] street driving a stagecoach smoking a
[1:03:51] cigar
[1:03:52] breaking the speed limits for the
[1:03:53] stagecoach and when they all the
[1:03:56] religions different religions raised up
[1:03:59] and told their part of their religion
[1:04:01] how great it was the Muhammad priest
[1:04:03] told how great his religion was the
[1:04:06] Buddha told how great his religion must
[1:04:07] and a certain little Minister I can't
[1:04:10] call his name now is representing the
[1:04:12] religion out
[1:04:15] America Christian religion and when he
[1:04:18] got his time to the platform he told a
[1:04:21] story of this great final woman how low
[1:04:24] down she was to even they didn't want to
[1:04:25] get around her to even get close enough
[1:04:27] to a retired Senator she was so immoral
[1:04:30] she was so degraded there was nothing
[1:04:32] could help her then he said gentlemen
[1:04:34] all the religions of this world can your
[1:04:37] religion produce anything that would
[1:04:40] cleanse the hands of this certain vile
[1:04:42] person everybody sit still right on in
[1:04:45] their seats no one said nothing then he
[1:04:47] jumped in the air and screamed and
[1:04:48] kicked his heels together he said the
[1:04:50] blood of Jesus Christ will only clean
[1:04:52] her hands by the cleaner heart and make
[1:04:54] her as purely the blood of the Lord
[1:04:57] Jesus Christ takes away sin us from all
[1:05:01] of our iniquity and makes us new
[1:05:03] creatures in Christ Jesus nothing else
[1:05:05] will do it Creed's Farms or nothing else
[1:05:07] will take his place it's been trying but
[1:05:09] it takes the blood that's the only place
[1:05:11] for divine Fellowship is under the blood
[1:05:14] that's the only remedy God knows he
[1:05:17] faced it he's infinite what he says
[1:05:19] first he has to always remain with that
[1:05:22] through this program now when they have
[1:05:24] come to the courts realizing if they're
[1:05:26] defiled setting in the congregation
[1:05:28] knowing they're wrong by faith they
[1:05:31] apply the blood
[1:05:32] believe it accept it the water the
[1:05:35] washing of the Water by the word
[1:05:38] cleanses them then and makes them ready
[1:05:40] now here's where the thing comes here's
[1:05:43] where the point comes most people says
[1:05:46] when I believe that's all I have to do
[1:05:47] now there's where the rub comes the man
[1:05:50] that the Waters of Separation could
[1:05:53] not get enter into the holiest of holies
[1:05:55] he could not yet come into the
[1:05:56] congregation
[1:05:58] he accepted it believed it I believe it
[1:06:01] was for him and he was sprinkled but the
[1:06:03] Waters of Separation but as he went
[1:06:05] Journey on
[1:06:07] towards the place of Fellowship
[1:06:11] the first thing you had to meet there at
[1:06:14] the door was seven stripes for the seven
[1:06:17] Church ages of God in all ages nothing
[1:06:19] but the blood
[1:06:21] and he had to know that going on before
[1:06:24] him
[1:06:25] when a sacrifice
[1:06:29] please recognize the blood before he
[1:06:30] could come get communication
[1:06:33] not only when he come under this Blood
[1:06:37] and he walked into the congregation into
[1:06:39] the presence of the Shekinah Glory of
[1:06:42] God and then was in full Fellowship
[1:06:44] worshiping under the blood
[1:06:47] what a beautiful picture of Christ at
[1:06:50] Pentecost
[1:06:51] bringing his church into full Fellowship
[1:06:55] it's like the young couple that I was
[1:06:57] speaking of when they get married that's
[1:07:00] not the whole thing
[1:07:01] they haven't done nothing but taking a
[1:07:03] ceremony
[1:07:04] the minister has only said I pronounce
[1:07:07] you husband and wife
[1:07:10] it's not ready yet what does he do he
[1:07:13] takes her to his house
[1:07:16] that he's prepared for her
[1:07:18] now
[1:07:20] many people here might disagree with me
[1:07:22] by this but you don't live but in a
[1:07:25] three-room house
[1:07:26] or you may have many other rooms but
[1:07:28] you've really only got three rooms that
[1:07:30] is the kitchen
[1:07:32] the living room and the bedroom you may
[1:07:35] have three or four bedrooms and you may
[1:07:36] have a kitchen and a dining room and so
[1:07:38] forth but really a person only lives in
[1:07:40] a three-room house
[1:07:42] you live in a three-room house in your
[1:07:43] body soul body and spirit God lived in a
[1:07:46] three-room house father son Holy Ghost
[1:07:48] everything is in a three and a three is
[1:07:51] a triangle take a triangle and shine a
[1:07:55] light on it with where three meets in
[1:07:57] one place will produce seven different
[1:07:59] colors seven different colors is a
[1:08:01] rainbow the rainbow is a covenant oh it
[1:08:04] just keeps going on and on and on and on
[1:08:07] because in that God made a covenant
[1:08:10] through these three things the house of
[1:08:14] scarlet and so forth and the light of
[1:08:16] God shining upon this makes a covenant a
[1:08:20] covenant of God made now when the woman
[1:08:23] is brought the Young Bride all how he
[1:08:26] loves her but yet they're not truly in
[1:08:28] full Fellowship yet
[1:08:31] now the first thing what is the kitchen
[1:08:32] to do is where you eat that's like it is
[1:08:36] in the first course of the church you
[1:08:38] eat here come sit on the back seat
[1:08:41] listen to the word and the first thing
[1:08:43] you know you begin to oh God that meant
[1:08:46] me you accept him as your personal
[1:08:48] Savior by faith you grasp it then you
[1:08:51] begin to eat the word you begin to to
[1:08:54] feel that you have accepted Christ as
[1:08:57] your personal savior
[1:08:59] you begin to Feast upon the work you
[1:09:01] enjoyed or used to you to get up and
[1:09:03] walk out of the building a preacher
[1:09:04] didn't say something that suited you not
[1:09:06] right you get up and walk out but after
[1:09:08] you once accepted Christ you've been
[1:09:10] separated then the waters by the word of
[1:09:13] separation
[1:09:15] separated you from your evil thinking
[1:09:18] then the next thing comes is into the
[1:09:21] the living room were you
[1:09:24] take your little bride she takes her
[1:09:27] veil off you're coming a little closer
[1:09:30] then when you do your put your arms
[1:09:33] around her talk to her Embrace her
[1:09:35] that's how it comes into the Fellowship
[1:09:38] of the Lord Jesus before you do you are
[1:09:41] separated from your sins then you
[1:09:43] embrace the Lord's gospel you embrace
[1:09:46] the the written word you believe it with
[1:09:49] all your heart God it doesn't matter
[1:09:52] what you want me to do whatever you have
[1:09:55] planned in my life I'm ready now to
[1:09:58] receive it
[1:10:00] that's in the the living room then still
[1:10:04] you say isn't this far enough no sir the
[1:10:07] next room is the bedroom
[1:10:09] then when you go to this bedroom then if
[1:10:12] you come into fellowship and
[1:10:15] relationship you become into a
[1:10:18] relationship then you have complete
[1:10:20] Fellowship because you cannot have
[1:10:22] complete Fellowship until you become
[1:10:24] relationship anyone knows that I listen
[1:10:27] so is it with the church today we got
[1:10:30] two
[1:10:31] we got too many of them that's a shame
[1:10:34] they're going to complete relationship
[1:10:36] with God to New Life and new births if
[1:10:39] we're the bride of Christ then why can't
[1:10:41] we go into a relationship that all the
[1:10:43] shameness and backwardness
[1:10:45] all is gone from us if we come into
[1:10:48] complete relationship been born again I
[1:10:50] don't care the president of the United
[1:10:51] States could be standing on the street
[1:10:53] you'd shout hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:10:55] hallelujah you don't care because you're
[1:10:58] coming to relationship you're born again
[1:11:00] you're a new child you're in the
[1:11:02] Shekinah Glory with god fellowshiping
[1:11:05] with him
[1:11:06] that's what the chart we need today
[1:11:08] brother is a worship under the blood a
[1:11:11] worship incomplete relationship to dial
[1:11:14] while the little bride said now wait a
[1:11:16] minute I I just I don't know uh I don't
[1:11:19] know what married life consists of such
[1:11:21] things he would never come into
[1:11:22] fellowship with her husband she could
[1:11:25] never come into a relationship or
[1:11:26] Fellowship until she first comes into a
[1:11:28] relationship that's what Samara at the
[1:11:30] church today and say oh I don't believe
[1:11:32] in that their kind of religion makes you
[1:11:33] shout and called a heartfelt religion
[1:11:35] and I don't believe in such things as
[1:11:37] that no wonder you've never come into it
[1:11:39] yet you into it and really get under the
[1:11:42] Shekinah Glory of God when the power of
[1:11:44] the Holy Ghost is falling down upon you
[1:11:46] you know something happened to your
[1:11:49] to you that life and become a new
[1:11:51] creature
[1:11:52] God is first
[1:11:54] how was it Charles Finney that time that
[1:11:56] made the statement about how I used to
[1:11:58] he was I believe it was Charles Finney
[1:12:00] that he had been preaching or someone he
[1:12:02] might not have been him I've just read
[1:12:03] it somewhere that he was the preaching
[1:12:06] he had sermons and two Little Women was
[1:12:08] praying for him and he would get the
[1:12:09] Holy Ghost and he told me he had the
[1:12:11] Holy Ghost and one day he went out
[1:12:13] behind the his office to pray and knelt
[1:12:16] down where an old tree had blowed down
[1:12:17] and while he was praying my stick broke
[1:12:19] he thought someone was coming up and he
[1:12:21] jumped up and said looked around
[1:12:24] he thought somebody's iron scene praying
[1:12:27] then he sat down and he said if I was
[1:12:29] talking to my boss
[1:12:31] in the office
[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:36] but here I'm ashamed of somebody to see
[1:12:39] me speak to my Lord
[1:12:41] there they come our conviction through
[1:12:43] all his coca Madison hatred and strong
[1:12:48] his fake cried out before God I told God
[1:12:50] feeling with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:52] then something happened
[1:12:53] he was different he got the starch out
[1:12:56] of him something taken place because
[1:12:58] he'd come into that kind of Glory into
[1:13:00] the relationship of God and fellowship
[1:13:03] divine
[1:13:07] hear the people
[1:13:10] into a fellowship
[1:13:13] for the Holy Spirit
[1:13:15] God whenever you get rid of that you're
[1:13:17] going back to babbling in you might as
[1:13:19] well bury yourself that's exactly right
[1:13:21] when we get to a place to where we get
[1:13:24] away from that kind of Glory that
[1:13:26] Praises of God that unfresh anointing
[1:13:28] that breaks down all the religious
[1:13:30] barriers and things that makes us one in
[1:13:32] Christ Jesus free for all condemnation
[1:13:34] that's what we need tonight that's what
[1:13:37] the church that's Divine Fellowship
[1:13:39] that's what I found in these conditions
[1:13:41] is places where men and women they are
[1:13:44] they're not ashamed they're not ashamed
[1:13:46] of the Gospel they're ready to testify
[1:13:48] saying about it shout about it I've even
[1:13:51] heard them speak in tongues once in a
[1:13:53] while
[1:13:54] don't hear too much of it no more but
[1:13:55] once in a while they do
[1:13:58] oh don't you never lose that if you ever
[1:14:00] lose that the place to where you get a
[1:14:03] shame to go into relationship with
[1:14:05] Christ let him dwell in you God and man
[1:14:08] making himself known to the People by
[1:14:10] his Spirit a royal priesthood a holy
[1:14:13] nation A peculiar people ah different
[1:14:15] from the world
[1:14:18] blood and satisfied from the things that
[1:14:21] hey man that's old time sex for us
[1:14:24] preaching but it'll save a man from sin
[1:14:26] and I'll clean a person up and make them
[1:14:29] it won't white wash but it'll wash your
[1:14:32] white it'll take all this
[1:14:36] already from you I've seen a little
[1:14:37] woman so bashful the chance
[1:14:41] straight away let her go down the Altar
[1:14:42] and come into that Shekinah Glory God
[1:14:44] he'll stand there and testify they'll
[1:14:46] shake the shingles on top of the house
[1:14:47] sir while she's in presence of God she's
[1:14:51] met somebody that's real life has become
[1:14:53] a new thing and she's no more Countdown
[1:14:55] by the world because she's in Divine
[1:14:57] Fellowship of Christ
[1:14:59] for me to live is Christ said Paul
[1:15:01] that's what
[1:15:03] I call real spiritual that you cannot do
[1:15:06] that by your Creeds you cannot Creeds
[1:15:08] will never satisfy a hungry Soul they're
[1:15:10] all right I'm nothing gives them but
[1:15:12] what we need today is divine Fellowship
[1:15:14] there's only one way to get it to the
[1:15:16] ground into the Shekinah Glory
[1:15:19] in the Old Testament the high priest
[1:15:20] went in once the year once a year
[1:15:24] and that bearing the blood before him he
[1:15:27] was anointed oh I like to stay
[1:15:29] I was anointed with the with anointing
[1:15:32] or I believe David cried How Sweet It Is
[1:15:35] for a brother to dwell together in unity
[1:15:37] it's like the precious anointing oil
[1:15:39] that was on the the beard of Aaron it
[1:15:41] run all the way to the hymns of His
[1:15:42] Garment
[1:15:43] all makes things run easy soft
[1:15:47] you know when a man gets really anointed
[1:15:49] and ready for God oh no just like a
[1:15:52] always felt sorry for a Mew
[1:15:54] a a mule was the dumbest thing I ever
[1:15:57] looked at you can whistle to him call
[1:15:58] too many sticking his ears out and look
[1:16:01] at you he don't know the gentleness like
[1:16:03] a horse though see he he does he hasn't
[1:16:05] got that much gumption and another thing
[1:16:07] a mule he doesn't he doesn't know where
[1:16:09] he come from don't you never say God
[1:16:11] ever made a mule that was man did that
[1:16:13] no
[1:16:14] don't you put God guilty of something
[1:16:16] like that
[1:16:17] that was crossbreeding the the mayor to
[1:16:20] the the Jack but don't you never don't
[1:16:22] you never lay that on to God God
[1:16:24] wouldn't do a thing like that no sir you
[1:16:27] know I like a pretty pedigreed horse you
[1:16:29] know a pretty pedigree to horse he's
[1:16:31] really nice and he knows who his papa
[1:16:33] was he knows where his mama was he knows
[1:16:35] exactly where he's standing but an old
[1:16:37] mule don't know who his papa was his
[1:16:38] mama was and here's another thing about
[1:16:40] it he cannot cross himself back again
[1:16:42] he's ruined for life but it's been about
[1:16:45] a lot of
[1:16:46] it puts an amount of a lot of people
[1:16:48] that call themselves Christians talk
[1:16:50] about the blood of Jesus said with their
[1:16:51] ears out set her like Buckeye they don't
[1:16:54] even know what the call means that's
[1:16:56] right you don't know who your papa was
[1:16:58] or your mama was but I'm telling you if
[1:17:00] you've ever come under the real Divine
[1:17:01] Fellowship been baptized with the Holy
[1:17:03] Ghost you know who your father
[1:17:07] you know where you're standing standing
[1:17:09] in all the good
[1:17:11] you know the holy spirit that barns you
[1:17:13] and give you new life you know where you
[1:17:15] come from you know who your father is
[1:17:19] we got too much new Religion Today I
[1:17:21] believe uh I really believe it no
[1:17:24] dishonor the high priest once the year
[1:17:26] went in one time a year with the blood
[1:17:28] before him I'm worshiped in the Shekinah
[1:17:31] Glory all anointed oh I love that
[1:17:35] anointed walking and he had garment on
[1:17:38] that had a pomegranate in the bell and
[1:17:40] he had to walk but that is such a step
[1:17:42] that played holy holy holy unto the Lord
[1:17:46] holy holy holy unto the Lord packing the
[1:17:49] blood before him as he went what a
[1:17:51] beautiful picture of the church today
[1:17:53] walking into the and you know the reason
[1:17:55] he made them Bells the people on the
[1:17:57] outside didn't know where he was alive
[1:17:59] or not unless he's making some noise I'm
[1:18:02] telling you brother
[1:18:07] a dead Church don't make any noise
[1:18:09] Something's Happened yes sir they
[1:18:12] haven't entered that holy holy God is
[1:18:14] over where you find God you find a lot
[1:18:16] of noise
[1:18:17] it's exactly right when Jesus went into
[1:18:19] Jerusalem they broke down palms and
[1:18:21] Galilean peasants begin to sing Hosanna
[1:18:24] to him that cometh in the name of the
[1:18:25] Lord
[1:18:26] some of those Pharisees said oh that
[1:18:28] makes Shields got my back that's
[1:18:29] sacrilegious oh don't you do make him
[1:18:31] hold your feet Jesus said if they hold
[1:18:34] their piece of rock so let me do they
[1:18:35] cry
[1:18:37] has to take place when Christ comes
[1:18:40] in but he took the blood to the mercy
[1:18:42] seat and only he alone could go in once
[1:18:46] a year but when Jesus died on the day of
[1:18:49] the atonement he rent the panel in two
[1:18:52] not only a high priest but whosoever
[1:18:55] will may come anytime in
[1:18:57] a glory of
[1:18:59] Glory isn't of the Holy Ghost into a
[1:19:01] real Pentecostal Fellowship
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:06] into a place in the presence of God for
[1:19:10] the power of God cleanses us from all
[1:19:12] unrighteousness we become new creatures
[1:19:14] in Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost falls
[1:19:16] upon us and all of our backwardness and
[1:19:19] shameness we become into relationship
[1:19:20] with God isn't the church the bride
[1:19:23] well shouldn't the bride be bringing
[1:19:25] forth children you're crying have our
[1:19:27] father

[1:19:31] anymore if we ever get away from that
[1:19:32] Shekinah Glory get away from there and
[1:19:34] don't know who your papa is don't know
[1:19:36] who your mama is out from under the
[1:19:38] blood Pentecostal grandchildren is David
[1:19:40] duplicitous call it God don't have any
[1:19:42] grandchildren
[1:19:44] no sir God only has Sons
[1:19:46] somebody's like I said here sometimes
[1:19:48] always talk about David said people come
[1:19:50] in the Methodist has come in they were
[1:19:52] born sons of God then there are children
[1:19:54] they take them to church and well
[1:19:56] because I was a Methodist and my
[1:19:57] children is a Methodist now that's not
[1:19:59] really children that's grandchildren see
[1:20:01] but now God don't have any grandchildren
[1:20:03] every man every woman every boy
[1:20:07] got to have an experience of entering in
[1:20:09] to the holiest of Holiness and being
[1:20:11] born again
[1:20:13] it's too bad the Pentecostal church is
[1:20:14] getting that way too we got some
[1:20:15] Pentecostal grandchildren let me tell
[1:20:17] you God don't have any the church has it
[1:20:19] but God don't have it every man that
[1:20:22] comes to God's got to come to the blood
[1:20:24] ever by every girl that's
[1:20:26] because something went before him to die
[1:20:28] for him before they can come into that
[1:20:30] Shekinah Glory be clean from a life of
[1:20:32] sin and become
[1:20:35] amen how he entered into this holy place
[1:20:39] the whole is of the holies to offer this
[1:20:42] Blood job the oldest book in the Bible
[1:20:46] even before Genesis has ever wrote job
[1:20:49] lived on the earth and you remember job
[1:20:51] all of his troubles all of his trials
[1:20:54] and his friends even accusing him his
[1:20:57] friends against him yet job maintained
[1:21:00] the the promise of God he maintained the
[1:21:03] fellowship in the hours of trial in so
[1:21:07] much that he cried he said I know my
[1:21:10] redeemer liveth
[1:21:12] when he was suffering and even his wife
[1:21:14] said job why don't you curse God and die
[1:21:16] job was under the blood he'd offer the
[1:21:18] burnt sacrifice which he knowed he was
[1:21:20] righteous because that's what God
[1:21:22] required he'd come under the blood and
[1:21:24] had Divine fellowship with God even in
[1:21:26] the last hours of his great Temptation
[1:21:28] he cried me yeah I'll trust him
[1:21:33] hey man that's what the church needs
[1:21:35] today is a no soul Fellowship under the
[1:21:38] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ even
[1:21:40] death can't even darken it out
[1:21:43] I stood by the bedside watch them die
[1:21:44] with a cold handshake I've seen him
[1:21:47] standing here and die shouting the
[1:21:49] Praises of God because it had Fellowship
[1:21:51] they knowed where they were standing
[1:21:54] oh how I could go through experiences of
[1:21:56] knowing of experiences I've seen with
[1:21:58] people how they don't never don't never
[1:22:01] try to get to God anything other than
[1:22:03] under the fellowship under the uh to
[1:22:05] fellowship with God but under the blood
[1:22:07] that's the only way God knows that's the
[1:22:09] only way God will recognize you must
[1:22:11] first be Washed by the Water of the word
[1:22:13] then cleanse through the blood and enter
[1:22:15] into the Shekinah Glory go into there
[1:22:17] into the fellowship then you know where
[1:22:19] you're standing at Daniel another one
[1:22:22] it's perfect in his heart he wouldn't
[1:22:24] defile himself for the king's meat when
[1:22:26] he was taken down into Babylon he
[1:22:27] maintained his Fellowship in the
[1:22:29] presence of lines that was ready to kill
[1:22:32] you yesterday Daniel held his Fellowship
[1:22:34] God sent an angel and stood by in that
[1:22:37] night and blood of the eyes and shut the
[1:22:39] mouth of the line because Daniel had
[1:22:42] fellowship with the supernatural Daniel
[1:22:44] had Fellowship for the god of Heaven
[1:22:46] because he was under the blood
[1:22:48] that's how he maintained his stand the
[1:22:51] Hebrew children right in the middle of
[1:22:53] the fire furnace no matter what you do
[1:22:55] to him UK Scorch that Fellowship away
[1:22:57] from him you can't throw him under
[1:22:58] enough trials to make him denied a man
[1:23:00] that's ever been under the blood of
[1:23:01] Jesus Christ and become filled with the
[1:23:03] Holy Ghost all the devils in Hell
[1:23:05] couldn't root it out of him
[1:23:07] before he's saying
[1:23:11] if you felt like I did you'd jump up in
[1:23:13] your seat and do the same thing but
[1:23:15] listen brother
[1:23:17] a baby that's born
[1:23:19] and don't cry don't whimper there's
[1:23:21] something wrong with that baby it's born
[1:23:22] dead
[1:23:24] that's right
[1:23:26] that's what's the matter there's too
[1:23:27] much of the churches today too much of
[1:23:29] the people call themselves Christians
[1:23:30] they are born dead still birth it's no
[1:23:34] good what they need to know what the
[1:23:36] doctor doesn't want to make a whimper he
[1:23:38] picks him up and turns him over and
[1:23:39] gives him a couple of good reps and he
[1:23:41] lets out a Squall that's what the church
[1:23:43] sees today is another good old time Holy
[1:23:45] Ghost baptism shaken of the church tell
[1:23:48] her to spank all the world out of it
[1:23:50] get it back to real Pentecost so
[1:23:52] blessing
[1:23:53] a real preacher that'll stand up and
[1:23:55] take the gospel and beat the whole the
[1:23:58] golden like the old beaters used to
[1:24:00] they'd beat the gold and turn it over
[1:24:02] and beat till all the drosses out of it
[1:24:04] how do you know it was ready when he
[1:24:06] could see his own reflection in it then
[1:24:08] he know the goal was ready the dross is
[1:24:10] out of it that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:24:11] does by the word it beats all the world
[1:24:14] out of the church until the refresh of
[1:24:15] Jesus Christ appears into the church and
[1:24:17] the people when God can see his
[1:24:19] reflection of his power like he did on
[1:24:22] the day of Pentecost when he sent the
[1:24:23] Holy Ghost down and the power of God
[1:24:26] made the people jump like new wine and
[1:24:28] they said what are these men full of new
[1:24:30] wine he said this is that which is
[1:24:32] spoken by the prophet Joel it'll come to
[1:24:34] pass the last day saith God I pour out
[1:24:37] my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons
[1:24:39] and daughters shall prophesy I'll show
[1:24:41] wonders in the heavens above and in the
[1:24:42] earth below signs and pillars of fire
[1:24:44] and smoking paper it shall come to pass
[1:24:46] before the noble day of the Lord shall
[1:24:48] come notable day
[1:24:49] whosoever call upon the name the Lord
[1:24:51] shall be saved
[1:24:52] what we need
[1:24:53] is a beating
[1:24:55] beating people back in backers to
[1:24:56] straighten the church up to pull it out
[1:24:58] of the Kate said it's in and come back
[1:25:00] under the Fellowship of the blood again
[1:25:01] into Shekinah Glory into a Pentecostal
[1:25:04] experience like ahead back many many
[1:25:06] years ago like we used to have years ago
[1:25:08] but we need like we did in the days of
[1:25:10] John Wesley way back in the days of
[1:25:12] Calvin not
[1:25:13] way back all the way to Pentecost what
[1:25:16] we need is a relationship again with God
[1:25:18] so men are waiting to die out to
[1:25:20] themselves in the secret chamber with
[1:25:22] God until New Life is produced until
[1:25:25] they become a new creature let a man do
[1:25:28] that if he's a little coward he'll go
[1:25:29] out and win souls because why he's
[1:25:31] becoming Divine relationship with God in
[1:25:34] the secret room to himself with him and
[1:25:36] God is Anointed and went in there with
[1:25:38] tears rolling over his cheeks and saying
[1:25:40] God give me the Holy Spirit I don't care
[1:25:42] if it costs my wife my children my
[1:25:44] girlfriend my everyone I am just fill me
[1:25:47] Lord till I can stand in your presence
[1:25:50] and feel the Shekinah Glory moving
[1:25:54] surging over me and through me
[1:25:57] thankfulness Mr Iverson Ned's father
[1:26:00] wrote that famous song a spirit of God
[1:26:03] moving me that's what we need move fresh
[1:26:07] fall upon me Lord stand there until God
[1:26:10] takes you in to the holiest of holies
[1:26:12] shuts the curtains behind you shut the
[1:26:15] world out and shut you up with Christ so
[1:26:17] you don't care who's around what else
[1:26:19] about it you're walking in the spirit
[1:26:21] led by the spirit doing the things the
[1:26:24] spirit would have you to do saying the
[1:26:25] things the spirit have you to say that's
[1:26:27] when you come into Divine Fellowship
[1:26:30] may God grant that to everyone yes the
[1:26:33] Hebrew children right in the middle of
[1:26:35] the fiery furnace they still maintain
[1:26:37] their Fellowship
[1:26:38] the five furnace didn't stop it stop it
[1:26:40] certainly not they still had just as
[1:26:42] much Fellowship as they ever had little
[1:26:44] Stevens after he had come under the
[1:26:46] blood and stood there and preached until
[1:26:48] his face shine like an angel I don't
[1:26:51] believe it shine like one of those
[1:26:52] lights certainly not an angel isn't that
[1:26:54] don't always have to meet a Shining
[1:26:55] Light an angel is a messenger somebody
[1:26:58] that knows what they're talking about I
[1:27:00] believe when Stephen stood up there that
[1:27:01] morning at the Saint Hadrian courts when
[1:27:03] they had him kind of condemn him and so
[1:27:05] forth he said which one of your fathers
[1:27:07] has and condemned the holy ghost or turn
[1:27:09] it away which one of them did you said
[1:27:11] you stiff that's uncircumcised the heart
[1:27:13] and ears knowing it would cost his life
[1:27:14] why did he care he knows what he was
[1:27:17] talking about why he'd come out of the
[1:27:19] blood and been up there Pentecost and
[1:27:21] his other Shekinah Glory and he didn't
[1:27:23] care what anyone said
[1:27:25] mean nothing to it you're so sure and so
[1:27:28] filled with the spirit until they begin
[1:27:30] to run up on me nice your teeth and vest
[1:27:32] uh break his head in with the rocks and
[1:27:34] things like that even death didn't even
[1:27:36] hide his Fellowship he raised his hands
[1:27:39] and said I see Jesus amen
[1:27:44] now you'll be Baptist shout we'll show
[1:27:45] you in a minute let me tell you brother
[1:27:47] even death Kanata could not hide it
[1:27:50] death could not do nothing
[1:27:51] you couldn't hide him from the
[1:27:53] fellowship because he's still maintained
[1:27:55] that perfect fellowship with Christ even
[1:27:57] the Rocks has beaten his head in he and
[1:28:00] Paul stand their soul it was then
[1:28:02] holding his garments looking at it it
[1:28:03] never did get away from him he's seen
[1:28:05] that that man had something although he
[1:28:08] was so full of Creeds and Theology and
[1:28:11] learned stuff though he looked at that
[1:28:13] man and he's seen that man had something
[1:28:14] his Creeds didn't produce
[1:28:16] he's seen the glory of God upon his face
[1:28:18] when Stevens looked up and said I see
[1:28:21] Jesus standing at the right hand of God
[1:28:24] still having Fellowship in the hour of
[1:28:25] his death because he come by God's
[1:28:27] appropriated way by the blood of Jesus
[1:28:30] Christ and it enter into the Shekinah
[1:28:32] Glory where real Fellowship was real
[1:28:35] Fellowship the Praises and powers of God
[1:28:38] Romans 5 1 saying therefore being
[1:28:41] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:28:43] God Fellowship restored all our love had
[1:28:47] fellowship with God peace restored back
[1:28:51] wow through the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:54] in my own City in Louisville Kentucky
[1:28:56] some few months ago there's an old
[1:28:59] fellow there that thought he was just an
[1:29:00] old bum he um he'd get out tracks and
[1:29:03] then he's down on the street and he was
[1:29:05] crossing one day he lived a little shady
[1:29:07] down close to the slummy part of the
[1:29:09] city there and what we call a Haymarket
[1:29:12] and he was uh lived down there but he
[1:29:14] done a great work going around giving
[1:29:15] out
[1:29:17] um little tracks it's true his clothes
[1:29:18] wasn't always as neat as I guess it
[1:29:20] could have been he's an old Bachelor and
[1:29:22] he was crossing the street one day in an
[1:29:24] automobile just struck him and just I
[1:29:26] looked like broke every bone and him
[1:29:27] roll right over him and they got him in
[1:29:29] an ambulance to the police ambulance and
[1:29:31] taking him up there to a certain
[1:29:32] Hospital
[1:29:33] and they began to examine him the city
[1:29:36] hospital they looked at his bones and so
[1:29:38] many bones they and they put the X-ray
[1:29:40] over him and found out his all broke up
[1:29:42] and the doctors went to hold a little
[1:29:44] counsel a little Fellowship among
[1:29:45] themselves over in one corner they
[1:29:48] thought the old fellow was out they said
[1:29:49] well the doctors come to this decision
[1:29:52] it's not worth our time after all he's
[1:29:55] nothing but just a bum and there's no
[1:29:57] money in it so it's nothing but just a
[1:29:59] bum so why would we waste our time here
[1:30:02] all day long trying to patch up that old
[1:30:04] bum and they thought there wasn't they
[1:30:06] decide they just covering back over and
[1:30:08] let him go but when they walked over
[1:30:09] there he wasn't as dead as they thought
[1:30:11] they were
[1:30:13] is that just a minute gentlemen
[1:30:16] he said I am worth something too
[1:30:19] his eyes were so much so God sent his
[1:30:21] son that he might die in my place
[1:30:25] and give me a Grace and a fellowship
[1:30:27] with him
[1:30:29] years ago I embraced that to my heart
[1:30:31] real fellowship with God he said and
[1:30:34] right now it's sweeter than it ever was
[1:30:36] in all my life he said sure I'm worth
[1:30:39] something God so lovely that he gave his
[1:30:41] son for me and he shed his blood that I
[1:30:44] might come into a fellowship
[1:30:47] with him in his sufferings and in his
[1:30:50] presence and he said I have maintained
[1:30:52] that all these years and now it's
[1:30:54] sweeter than it ever was you can imagine
[1:30:56] the embarrassments on those doctors
[1:30:58] faces at that time sure you're worth
[1:31:00] something each one of these worth
[1:31:01] something God gave his life for you why
[1:31:03] can't you give yours for his why can't
[1:31:05] you dedicate yourself in time all
[1:31:07] together come if you stay away if you
[1:31:10] don't come the right approach now if you
[1:31:11] just go and start turn over a new Leaf
[1:31:13] that won't work you've got to come God's
[1:31:16] way come under the blood then get into
[1:31:18] Shekinah Glory in the presence of God
[1:31:20] then you can Worship the Lord God sure
[1:31:23] Psalm 1900 years ago
[1:31:26] over Calgary let's take a little view
[1:31:28] for a few minutes as we're passing on it
[1:31:31] was one a horrible morning
[1:31:33] oh there never was a morning and never
[1:31:35] will be like that they've been a trial
[1:31:38] that morning a mock trial in the courts
[1:31:42] I had an innocent man had been condemned
[1:31:45] and I see now I hear an old something
[1:31:47] bumping over the street going out
[1:31:49] towards Calvary and as a look there was
[1:31:51] a little fella the Bible said there's
[1:31:53] not no beauty that we should desire him
[1:31:55] he had a cross on his shoulders the
[1:31:57] blood streaked across his back in a
[1:32:00] mocking crown of thorns on his face in
[1:32:04] the spittle of the cruel drunken
[1:32:06] soldiers hanging off his face dragging
[1:32:08] down the street the whole cross dragging
[1:32:11] out the bloody Footprints of the barrier
[1:32:13] as he starts up the mountain I sees
[1:32:16] garment is soaked in blood splashing
[1:32:19] against the sides of his leg a sight
[1:32:22] that no man had ever known what that man
[1:32:24] could look at it his remain the same
[1:32:26] there he was
[1:32:28] oh the devil always doubted him the
[1:32:31] devil thought he was just a prophet the
[1:32:33] devil was sure the end of that was just
[1:32:35] a prophet because how could God ever let
[1:32:39] somebody spit in his face how could God
[1:32:41] ever be beat into into a pub why it was
[1:32:45] the same reason it couldn't be a prophet
[1:32:47] it couldn't be an angel it had to be God
[1:32:49] who come to Honey's Lost Child In the
[1:32:51] Garden of Eden did he send an angel did
[1:32:53] he send a prophet he came himself that's
[1:32:56] how God Came manifested In the Flesh in
[1:32:58] the person of his son Jesus Christ here
[1:33:00] he goes up the hill pulling the cross
[1:33:02] and that bee of death began to buzz
[1:33:05] around him then I you know I seen him up
[1:33:08] there he quoted some scripture to me but
[1:33:10] I'm sure now he's nothing but a man
[1:33:12] because look could God let somebody spit
[1:33:15] in his face and get by with it he did it
[1:33:17] for your sake he did it he didn't have
[1:33:19] to do it but he did it for my sake and
[1:33:21] your sake he did it that he might
[1:33:23] sanctify and cleanse us from sin he
[1:33:26] might give us an example of how to be
[1:33:28] humble and how to live right how to
[1:33:30] offer the other cheek or go to the
[1:33:32] second mile or or give the quote to the
[1:33:34] brother that needed it he practiced what
[1:33:36] religion was a Jehovah's religion he he
[1:33:39] had it in him and there he was going up
[1:33:42] the hill I see that old bumblebee of
[1:33:44] death whirling around him looking him
[1:33:46] over good said look at there could God
[1:33:48] ever be that could that be Emmanuel
[1:33:49] certainly not it could not be he never
[1:33:51] let somebody spit in his face and put a
[1:33:53] mocking Crown of Thorns over his head
[1:33:56] and give him a false scepter in his hand
[1:33:58] and beat his back into a pup you don't
[1:34:00] have something about a prophet he's done
[1:34:02] me a lot of trouble so I'll certainly
[1:34:04] get him in a few minutes at Calvary let
[1:34:06] me tell you brother when he made his
[1:34:08] buzz and stung him at Calvary something
[1:34:10] happened when he anchored that Stinger
[1:34:12] into Emmanuel's flesh you don't want a
[1:34:16] bee stings deep he pulls his stinger out
[1:34:18] when he comes and when he stung that
[1:34:20] time he stung more than a prophet he
[1:34:22] stung Emmanuel what was it he left his
[1:34:25] stinger in there today to the Christian
[1:34:28] believer that comes under that blood
[1:34:30] that he shed their calorie under the
[1:34:32] Divine Fellowship the real Full Gospel
[1:34:34] Pentecostal fellow ship with the
[1:34:37] Pentecostal blessings and Pentecostal
[1:34:39] signs and Pentecostal lives Pentecostal
[1:34:41] attributes when you come out of that
[1:34:44] death doesn't have any Stinger anymore
[1:34:46] it can buzz and Buzz I know a cruel hook
[1:34:49] knows Jew at one time bitter and
[1:34:52] indifferent
[1:34:53] Stone Stevens is on his road down to
[1:34:55] Damascus one day and fell under the
[1:34:57] power of God what happened
[1:34:59] he came into the place to come into that
[1:35:01] Divine fellowship with the Son of God
[1:35:03] one day down in Rome they was building a
[1:35:06] sacrifice block to cut his head off for
[1:35:08] public execution under the Roman
[1:35:10] government and when he was ready to die
[1:35:12] that bee come down and starts humming
[1:35:15] around him but you know what he said
[1:35:17] he said oh B worries your stinger
[1:35:19] oh grave or is your Victory but thanks
[1:35:23] be to God who gives us a victory through
[1:35:26] our Lord Jesus Christ what was it even
[1:35:28] an hour of his death he still maintained
[1:35:31] that Fellowship that he had found up
[1:35:33] there in that Pentecostal blessing they
[1:35:35] were one of the Pentecostal disciples
[1:35:36] that was up there maintained that
[1:35:38] Fellowship right on down through trials
[1:35:40] tribulations nothing could separate them
[1:35:43] from the love of God that was in Christ
[1:35:44] and today there's only one basis for
[1:35:46] real genuine Fellowship that Fellowship
[1:35:49] is Full Gospel Fellowship when a man has
[1:35:51] come through the waters of Separation

[1:36:06] salvation to everyone that believeth
[1:36:09] amen amen it's a good oh you might say
[1:36:14] it's just the ABCs but that's what it
[1:36:16] takes I always believe Christ
