granddaughter richard and tina's daughter allison and her husband's house burned down yesterday morning there on the property out of eagle feather and just remember them in prayer they lost everything and so i know that fires just could be really devastating and can't imagine what they'd be going through during this time so let's just remember them in prayer as well the lord would have his perfect will in their their life at this time i believe that was all the requests were told to me there was one that i forgot just maybe make it known with an uplifted hand or you know we have all unspoken requests each one has needs this evening let's just stand this evening brother ed douglas i'm going to ask if you would come and just speak to the lord on our behalf for these needs i claim the blood

service over now to brother watkins just pray that the lord would speak to our hearts this evening amen amen i'm a little torn where i go from here i've got multiple songs in my mind so let's try looking for a city hopefully i don't make you guys too nervous if you know this song you just sing real loud here among the shadows living in a lonely land with strangers were a band of pilgrims on the move through dangerous burden down on every hand but worse the city built above [Music] looking for a city where we'll never die the sainted millions never say goodbye then we'll meet our savior and our loved ones too o come holy spirit all our hopes renew hearing disappointment often we so sadly wrong and earthly friends no longer speak one word of love oh but truly we have found a prompt we are looking for a city built above [Music] millions never say goodbye oh then we'll meet our savior and our loved ones too come o holy spirit all our hopes let's try verse 3. in this land of dangers we are going here and there and there we're simply trusting in the blessed savior's love living world of care looking for a city tried hard let's never die [Music] oh yes [Music] hallelujah give the lord a handclap of praise amen praise the lord i'm looking for a city i don't know that song but i can identify with the words looking for a city amen praise the lord i trust that you amen came to see jesus here tonight again amen i know that i did i know that i that i just felt over there and after today after this morning i said well i got about 10 out so he said they could get another 10 tonight i said we'll see so sometimes the lord gives you something that's bigger than you could say you preach 10 parts on it you still don't feel like you even scratch the surface that's the way the word is you know brother branham said that that jesus would be revealed in the ceaseless ages to come he said it was an ever unfolding revelation i i can to say this i cannot get enough of it i want more of it can you say that tonight i said lord just give me just a little measure more amen something that we could say upon her heart that would just be a blessing encouragement to you and then thank you for all the music amen brothers and sisters we'll just turn to the word tonight i want to just to turn to luke chapter 24. we'll begin reading here amen luke chapter 24. i trust that the word was a blessing to you this morning amen and that something was said that would be an encouragement to you amen have just another part to this i want to get to and we're just going to continue on this rebuilding the temple or the tabernacle of david amen luke chapter 24 and then we're going to just uh we're going to just read just a few verses here that i'll have you be seated i'd like to actually before we before we go there amen i want to read this morning the text that we read of acts 14 if you have your bible will turn there first um and let me just let me just pull up a note here if you had that and then powerpoint brother jeremy our pdf i sent to you i'm not sure if you got that but if we can just have that ready to display that would be that'd be wonderful amen all right just give me a moment to get it pulled up on my end amen okay i've got it here all right i'm gonna change that one more time scripture first corinthians chapter one now that i've got the right notes in front of me now we know where we want to read you love the lord first corinthians chapter one we're just gonna begin we're just gonna read one verse and then i'll have you be seated first corinthians 1 verse 21 for after that in the wisdom of god notice this the world by wisdom knew not god read that again for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe heavenly father we thank you lord for this opportunity once again we have lord to be gathered here with believers of like precious faith lord with one common goal one common desire lord that we have lord and that's to learn how to be a better christian father how to live and serve you better lord is father uh a servant lord that's useful lord a a servant who's given lord been given so much as we have as your family lord but not just to take what you've given us lord and to bury it father but to use it lord as a tool for that's what you gave it to us for now lord i pray that you would come by your spirit once again lord as we seen you come this morning father you showed up as your prophet said you always come wherever you're invited lord so we raise our hands tonight and we say come holy spirit we invite you just now come and take your abode lord come and take these words lord that aren't the words of man father but it's words of eternal life and may you impart that to each and every single person tonight maybe a different measure lord maybe one would hear something that another would hear lord the same phrase but lord they would receive something totally different from it for that's just lord how you do things you're the great shepherd lord and no one leaves disappointed when they come with an expectation to see you now lord i pray that you would just take prayer minutes now we ask and in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated i'd like to just continue this uh rebuilding the tabernacle of david and again i'm not sure that we'll get to too much uh of the actual thought that we the the core of where we're wanting to go with this but we just want to cover just a portion of this we could speak about the tabernacle of david and the tabernacle of solomon and what we'd like to look at tonight just here for a few minutes is the tabernacle of solomon i believe that solomon represents something today uh modern day today speaking of our age we know that the ladies in church would be typified through many examples in the bible uh that the spirit that would come upon the age that you and i live in would be represented by a spirit that you find even all the way back in the old testament we know that the bible says in second chronicles and i'm going to list these scriptures if you can pull them up on the screen brother jeremy that'd be fine i wouldn't want you to try to turn to them turn to them in your seat um as i'd read it before you could get there but second chronicles chapter 1 verse 1. the bible says and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and the lord his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly so we know that the the bible is going to speak of jesus and it's going to call him the son of david this is said in many places matthew chapter one when he's going to list the genealogy of jesus is going to start with this genealogy and is going to list it as jesus the son of david and you could ask the question how was jesus the son of david well he was the son of david both spiritually and he was literally the son of david in fact most people believe that matthew lists joseph's line lineage and you'll find that he sums it up he doesn't list every descendant but he sums it up by saying starting with jacob then into joseph all the way through joseph you'd come all the way down to jesus and he would descend from the house of david and that was going to be important the bible speaks a lot about he was the root and he was the offspring of david and so we know that david david was going to hold a very crucial part in the scripture it was going to hold a very crucial part to the plan of redemption we know that it would be through david that he would have a son named solomon who the bible says that david desired to build a house for the lord but god says david you can't build my house you're a man of war uh you're a bloody man you you you it'll come not through you but it'll come through your loins it'll come through solomon but even solomon's temple though as grand and as grandious as it was and beautiful as it was solomon's was did everything bigger than david it was more gold it was more splendor there was more beauty outwardly speaking it was a much greater temple than any temple even today to re the reconstruction of solomon's temple and the the the if you see just images of solomon's temple and reconstruct it's just one of such glory one of such beauty and and solomon was uh everything that he built was bigger you could say it was better outwardly speaking but we know that ultimately the tabernacle of god wasn't going to rest in solomon's temple but jesus was going to come in the world and he was going to say behold a greater than solomon is here and he and he would point to the temple of solomon he would point to even herod's temple that they had rebuilt in the day that jesus in the days of herod and jesus was going to say behold a greater one greater than the temple is before you now what they didn't realize is that though they had worshiped god in temples made with hands all the way from moses when he made a tabernacle in the wilderness moses was trying to reconstruct an inspiration that god had given him and god said build it exactly as you see it but then god would move from that temple and he'd move into solomon's temple and he'd have he'd have the same colors and he'd have gold he'd lay it with purple and with scarlet and and he would he'd have some of the same articles of the tabernacle the menorah the table of showbread the altar of incense the laver all of those articles were in solomon's temple it was greater than moses desert tabernacle where it was just a tent made of linen now it was actually pillars made of stone and pillars made of lebanon trees from lebanon cedar trees and it was more beautiful it was grandeus it was great splendor and as you and as you can follow this you can see that it was god moving towards something he moved from the tent in the wilderness to something a little greater it was a little grander it was a little larger we noticed that temple was also rebuilt we're not preaching on this here today but just to cover it even through nehemiah they would come and rebuild that temple and stand in its glory we know what happens when nebuchadnezzar comes the babylonians come and they take uh the temple and they destroy it and they ransack it and they take all the menorah and the articles of the tabernacle and they completely defile it and destroy it in the days of herod it's rebuilt again and you can go and see a modern-day uh reconstruction of that temple even on a small scale representing solomon's temple but even greater it was larger it and and as it went as as time went on it went further and to greater and greater and greater and more splendor and more grandeur and more beauty and more ah and more outward glory as man always tends to look on the outward beauty until now that temple herod's temple is destroyed and now here stands a little humble brother branham says brother adam says frail little stoop shoulder man from galilee and he says behold i say to you one greater than the temple is before you now and what they didn't realize is that when they seen jesus they seen the temple yet the bible says there was no beauty that we should desire him he was lowly he was meek it wasn't going to be solomon's temple but this is the temple this is the rebuilt tabernacle of solomon of david it was going to be the rebuilt tabernacle he was the son of david now we know that the bible speaks of this and it ties them in with the lineage of david both literally and also spiritually even the spiritual uh seed the the spiritual church is the uh the uh the abraham's seed by faith not literally but by faith we know that brother branham speaks of this and and i want you just to show that if you could the pdf there and this is going to get a little teachy but we're using sunday night for this so don't fall asleep on me i got you some visuals here so you can actually follow along revelations 3 7-13 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and sheddeth and no man openeth i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou has a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie now let's move on past this if you can to the next paragraph brother branham says in the philadelphian church he says the reason i'm saying this this way so you can see what i mean by the lap over now we're not covering that lap over between the philadelphia and the ladies and age but just follow this closely here he says so you can see what i mean by the lap over see it's from the missionary age of the door but you see he had told them he had the key of david and so forth but here he said he had set before the church now after that age of missionary whitfield and all those others finney sankey moody owned down moody being one of the last come down to now he set an open door before the church here's where you have to watch now it's just in between the philadelphian and ladies and age lap over jesus is the door now if you'll turn with me to john 10 17 let's back this up now be sure many of you would believe and then somebody would say well i never he just said that i like to just read it john the 10th chapter the 17th verse all right we have these we read these words he says john uh john 10 7 not 17 then said jesus unto them verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheepfold that's back into the blessings how do we get into christ what is he the sheepfold i often wondered about that could he be a door being a man now over in the eastern country there i found out one day when i notice that the shepherd at night time he takes all the sheep inside of the corral drives them through a door and then when he gets all of them in there he counts them all to see if they're everyone in then he lays down in the door himself glory to god nothing can come in to the sheep or any sheep can go out without crossing him so jesus is the door into the sheepfold you say what did it mean when jesus said i am the door what was he speaking of that's why he could say all that the father hath given me and he says will come unto me and i won't lose one of them brother madam said why because he's the pastor he's the pastor of the sheep and the pastor lays down he's the door that's why jesus could say no man can pluck him out of my hand you see it's not you watching over your children's life it's not your father your fathers and mothers love their children but you know who's watching over the seed of god down inside of them not your mistakes not how good you are not how how many times you read them the bible or tell them about jesus that's good but if they're a seed of god god protects his own seed and jesus said i won't lose one of them because i'm protecting their life oh you ought to rejoice in that tonight church he lays down in the door nothing can come into the sheep or any sheep go out without crossing him so jesus is the door oh my he says now it says in isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of david will lay will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open none shall shut he shall shut none shall open the spirit uses this old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church what the key of david signified at that time is mere shadow which is now fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands it has to do with our lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage but what does the key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it's not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right but jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulder i love how the prophet has a way listen to me my brother my sister you won't find this at dallas theological seminary you know where you're going to find this from a kentucky 7th grade education hillbilly who almighty god divinely tabernacled and spoke through this isn't the my this isn't the mind of william branham this is the mind of christ can you say amen he says it's on his shoulder but what he says he alone has use of that keeper he alone is open shuts the door but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does the shoulder have to do with it read isaiah 9 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east now he's already pointed to the east why did jesus say he was the door because the over in the eastern culture the the the the shepherd of the sheep lays down gets all the sheep in and then he lays down so he becomes the door brother madam says now what is it about that key of david it's the position of the key it's not in his hand it's not laying in another man's hand it's not around his shoulder it's not around his neck but it's on his shoulder brother branham says it's the government it's isaiah 9 6 the government shall be upon his shoulder what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government on a shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and place it as oh places it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head what do you do when you come to christ you lay down your rights you lay down your ideas you lay down your ambitions you surrender to the headship of the word and unless you're under the headship of this word you're not under the headship of the hour and further than that you're not under the protection of the word not the headship of a man hello not the headship of a bishop or an archbish archbishop we have a lot of denominational ideas that infiltrate the message let's let's go back to the word not the headship of a man not the headship of a of a of a of a of a of anybody the headship of the word that's your headship who's your spiritual husband it's not your pastor your spiritual husband is christ that's what brother branham taught now that's not what a lot of men have mixed up and confused a lot of people with but brother branham said who is that who is your spiritual husband christ no man can take that place you want not give any man that place man is just that he's fallible he's making mess up he can fall he can you can be greatly disappointed because man will fail you but jesus will never fail you he's the man who never fails he's always there he's always faithful he says she's transferred her rights to him he is the head but also that he i love this so much because you say brother matt what what go okay i'm gonna give up my rights when a woman takes a husband what is she doing she's giving up her independence and she's giving dependence over to a man now that's the bible teaching that's not what ladies teaches but that's what the word of god teaches but paul said wives obey your husband for its right in the lord even the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and all the men say amen but keep reading and he gave himself for her that's what paul said he said as even as christ is the head of the church and gave himself for the church a true man who's the head of his home has given himself to his family amen that's right brother matt preach it you say what is there you but but you see there's a there's there's a beauty when you come to christ and you come under his headship you get a you get something for that you're not just giving up the right brother brandon says when that woman takes the veil and she takes it off and she places it on the shoulder he says what's it doing it's signifying i'm under your head chip i'm under your authority i'm under you're a dominion you're i'm transferring all of my rights to you that he is the head but not only that also i'm glad there was an also that he bears the responsibility and the care that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility what do you do when you give yourself to jesus you are saying i'm coming under your headship and you are now responsible for me you're responsible for my family you're responsible for my care and that's why jesus says cast your cares upon me for i care for you and that i love this and that uh not sure where you're at there and that beloved is the key of david god being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride that's the key of david because it was about a lineage it was about a seed it was a seedline of christ and you were part of that seed that's why brother adam says when you heard this message you you left the other thing you recognized this as eagle food you heard from your theophany what was that theophany it was your representation in the word brother adam said it this way the word in you seen the word that'll make a baptist shout shouldn't only ought to make message believers shout the word in you brother madam says the word in you seen the word and he said there was a connection there was a magnetizing there was something that pulled you oh it wasn't you saying oh well you know i just got good enough and i guess i was intellectual enough come on somebody i guess i was intellectual enough to understand the message and that's why i see the message because i figured it all out for myself oh my goodness it had nothing to do with you it had nothing to do with me it was sovereign grace that god called me before the foundation of the world before i breathed my first breath he already ordained me to eternal life and when you heard the word you were magnetized to the word the word seen the word that's what brother madam says the word in you seen the word there was a connection beloved that is the key of david god being sovereign he foreknew by divine election by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her somebody say it with me he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone i say yes lord i belong to you and to you alone i didn't call me you called me i didn't save me you saved me i can't perfect me you've got to perfect me i can't get me out of here you got to get me out of here i can't change my body but the word that i believe is changing me day by day do you realize my friend when your body changed people say oh my goodness how how it's going to be a miracle absolutely it's going to be a miracle but let me tell you what you know how i know that my body's going to change because i'm changing now under the word of god i'm able to change now oh brother adam says he accepts i love that she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for christ is the head of his church as sarah called abraham lord even so the bride is happy that he is her lord amen he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me revelations 3 20 but let me say this our lord is not defeated men claim to open the door to god and shut that door but they are liars all that the father has given me that's what brother branham is saying he's saying these men who who try to take people out from my well you're only going to come if you come to this certain preacher you come to this certain church and you're you know men love to preach doctrines that that you can only get here they they love to to draw men unto themselves and build kingdoms brother and says but they're all liars he says they're all he says that people say men claim to open the door and shut that door but they're liars all that the father has given him will come to him and he that cometh to him in no wise will be cast out he will lose none amen he will lose none of them he will lose none of them you got to let that sink in he's not going to lose me he's not going to lose my children he's not going to lose my family because and you know what that does he accepts that obligation brother branham says and when the last elected member to the body of christ comes in then will our lord appear the key of david was not david the king of israel all israel and it's not jesus the son of david according to the fact that he will sit upon the throne of david in the millennium and reign and rule over his heritage surely so the key of david signifies that it is jesus who will bring in the millennium he who has the keys to death and hell will raise up his own that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the earth glory to god what a difference when you look at this throne of david versus the throne of solomon you can take that down now i want to show you something here in the scripture and then we're just going to read just a few here and you could have them ready to display on the screen one of the most tragic stories you'll read about him we're going to get to it lord willing next sunday one of the most tragic men the life story of a man now you can read the life of david and there's sad parts to it but as many for as many low lights there's highlights and and i've got uh uh uh you can you can look at stories of jacob and you could see low lights but you could also see highlights sadly this man here is ends his life uh in a low light but i believe we can learn so much from him this man is not a judas that i'm about to read to you about he's not a judas who betrayed the lord and had such evil in his heart he sold the lord for money he's not a herod who was a murderer who tried to murder the seed of god he's not a hater at all he's not a he's not an evil contentful man this story that you read about but oh actually this man was the very son of david the king of jerusalem and he himself became a king he said brother matt who is that that's this man we read about solomon the bible says that years before bethlehem now you you can take this story and we're not going to be nearly have enough time to to uh to to to to to go through every aspect of his life i just want to capture this the portion here before we close you see because this man rejected the voice of god or i could even go further than that and i can say that this man failed to accept christ in his life you say brother matt solomon was an old testament believer so how could he fail to accept christ well brother branham said this brother branham says jesus christ is in every verse of the bible and he says and if you don't see jesus in every verse you need to go back and read it again hello so every type and everything you read about all of it was a foreshadowing now these men lived a parabolic life they had no idea that their life was literally living a parable they were that you take the life of joseph joseph had no idea that when he was being cast into prison when he was being sold by it to his bro by his brothers to raiders when he was down in a cave joseph had no idea that he was living a parable he was living a type of christ you can you can read about all of the whatever character you want to name jonah had no idea that when he died in the belly of a well when he's laying down there in the slobber and in the guts and the organs of a fish he had no idea that his life was a parable his life was a type he went and lived that life in the belly of a well so that jesus could stand stand centuries later and say that even as jonah was in the belly of the well for three days and three nights so the son of man shall go into the go into the bosom of the earth now he had no idea he had no idea his life that he was just living every day ordinary life he had no idea that his life was typified shadowing christ i thought that was wonderful he had no idea his life he was living very normal life now you you say what what is what is solomon here the bible says that jesus was revealed throughout the entire bible not just the new testament but even throughout the old testament it points us to one thing to christ it was on the road to emmaus that the bible says that christ jesus begins to reveal to cleopas and his disciples the bible says it this way and beginning at moses that's what the bible says and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded to them in all of the scriptures the things concerning himself i'd have loved to been there for that sermon you want to talk about a teacher of teachers being able to break down the word in every type and anti-type and the bible says this is how what did he do now jesus didn't even realize that jesus when jesus was a little baby boy two and three years old he had no idea who he was but there came some day when brother branham says when he began to read the scriptures and he began to read the scrolls he had to recognize himself in the word just as you have to recognize yourself at what age did jesus realize or recognize until one day he's at the temple and he's his mother loser says where were you and he says don't you know i should be about my father's business not speaking of joseph now he's speaking of his heavenly father even down to the point to where brother branham says when he realized what day did he realize that he was the sacrificial atoning lamb that would take away the sins of the world to the point to where he recognized his place in the word and said father if it be possible let this cup pass for me nevertheless not my will but thine be done he said brother matt that means he was a man aha he was in fact you say well he was only some man brother man said no he was 100 man and he was 100 percent god he was the god man i love the prophet's english he was the god man he was 100 percent god he was 100 percent man brother and i says don't you ever let anybody tell you he wasn't a man but don't you ever let anybody tell you that he was anything short of deity brother branham says he says what was he he was more than a man he says he was a man when he when he wept at the tomb of lazarus and he says but when he those little shoulders went back and he said lazarus come forth he said that was more than a man speaking amen but he began to expound to them all of the scriptures oh even even from from moses all the way to the prophets that's why the bible says i think it's in first corinthians he says paul says that they all did eat of that same manna remember that paul says they all did eat of that spiritual food they drank of that same spiritual rock for they drink of that spiritual rock and that rock was christ that rock that followed them in the wilderness was christ it's all jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he was the rock in the wilderness he followed them they ate and drank the spiritual food jesus said i am that bread that came down from heaven so even solomon himself the bible says even for a while uh this this solomon here starts with a good desire a man who the bible says that he magnified the lord magnified before all the people he greatly increased this man solomon the bible says that solomon had prayed and asked the lord for wisdom god had granted him this prayer we know brother man preaches queen of sheba and he talks about the discernment gift that laden solomon that she would come all the way from the east east on this multi-night journey on camels throughout the through the desert and risk her life just to have a few minutes under the wisdom of this great man solomon but there came a time in solomon's life where something you even read about the song of solomon if you go back and you read and you study the song of solomon it's it's known in the jewish bible as the song of songs and it was it was it was oh you you read all the way from the first chapter all the way to the end you'll see a a dramatic story you know you'll hear solomon speaking about the banqueting table and and and he begins to speak about his beloved in the chambers and solomon uh begins to speak about the banner of love that was over him i'm not going to read some of these scriptures out of the song of solomon but the bible says that he speaks about the rose of sharon and and he sees the lily of the valley he sat under the wings of the almighty the god was no doubt and solomon had a relationship in some way a connection like david his father had a connection with the holy spirit his delight had been the voice of his beloved as solomon speaks about the voice of his beloved and solomon begins to speak about this banqueting table and he sat under the banner of love he had great wisdom and in his spirit he communed with the holy spirit and and and no doubt no doubt solomon for his in his in his younger years in the youth of his life lived with the fervency before god had a great desire to build the house of the lord but there came a time in this man's life song of solomon 2 10 solomon notice what he says rise up my love my friend my fair one and come away solomon what was he what was he speaking of he was he was preaching about this relationship with christ this relationship with the holy spirit this satisfaction to his soul the spiritual drink the spiritual bread this atmosphere this enrapturing filling and solomon to begin to speak about this in in and to chapter 2 verse 17 he says turn my beloved so notice what it was it was a call it's all about solomon who begins to speak about the little foxes you remember that the little foxes that spoil the vine it was a call to get rid of the foxes that was spoiling his vine it was a call to reach out into the deep and the great spiritual pastures of revelation and behold the lord high and lifted up solomon was hearing from the voice of his beloved a call to satisfy delight thyself in the lord he says in solemn song of solomon 2 17 turn my beloved and be thou like a row or a young deer upon the mountains come and pan after the beloved as the deer pants for the water on mount bathur so solomon hears this this man this calling of god it was a life that he he lived it was a reality that he had it was something that he even begins to speak about further in that same chapter and and says come away my love come away arise and come with me it was this solomon who sat at the queen of sheba sat at his feet as we said and began to hear of his spiritual wisdom oh but he was a man who was highly sought after brother branham says greatest man in the east even jesus would speak of him and say behold a greater than solomon is here but with all of that limelight all of that pomp all of that prestige there needs to be character so brother man i said power without character satanic put a man in a position without the character to handle that position and it becomes evil something that could be used for a good becomes used for a bad it's been ministry that's destroyed the lives of a lot of people ministry a good thing that should offer healing and hope and encouragement and restoration and salvation and deliverance but that same ministry can be used for destruction and and can tear lives down can tear people's confidence down it was all of this pomp and all of this center stage wealth he was wealthier than any man in the world had all the money you could ever want in life he had been lifted up and lifted up and as i said in the spotlight the sinner say the sinner stage but now the bible says that at the latter years of his life in the later years of solomon's life he begins to become a very callous man you read about it in ecclesiastes you can read about it and even in the proverbs some of the things solomon begins to get almost maniacal almost just in serious and the way he says certain things you know it's all vanity and and what good is life and you you you build up all of this wealth it's all vanity and it begins to become a very i have no other way to say it than this way a very lustful man very lustful man in his elder years in the twilight of his life it would be the little foxes that spoiled the vine the bible says he takes to himself the scripture says wives and we know we know the story without having to get too much into it here today but the bible says he had 700 wives 300 concubines couldn't get enough it goes on further in first kings i'm going to have you read this first kings 11 verse 1. if you have your bible just use it there and if they have it on the screen for those who who don't that'd be just fine first kings 11. but king solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh you can move to verse 2. of the nation's nations concerning which the lord said unto the church of israel you shall not go into them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave that word clave is the same thing that paul says he says don't you know that he who takes in a harlot becomes one with the harlot he takes it into his bosom it becomes one flesh he clave unto it it's a knitting together and solomon becomes knitted together as only love emotional love has a way to knit you and you you cleave it's an addiction it becomes something that can't be easily broken it's a lust in his life to where it's more than just something he dabbles in or messes up but now he takes the bible says and he claim notice verse one again and and the the previous verse to that he took in many strange women of the nations what the lord said in the churches you shall not for they will turn away your heart after their gods this is exactly what happens imagine that now you said by the man who was this man this was one of the most gifted men on the planet hello somebody one of the most gifted men god gifted one of the most gifted it doesn't matter how great your gift how great your talent how great your ability unless you're under the subjection of the holy spirit brother adam says it power without character satan become satanic but power with character is fit to rule you see that in david versus solomon but the tabernacle of solomon was sensual as we see he loves many women and the bible says he was notice what it was one of the most gifted men on the earth but he was trying to get the best out of both worlds to have one foot in the world one foot in the church door one foot on the bar stool one foot with the church people one foot with the social people social of the world and and the bible says that he would he wanted the lord no doubt you can read that in the song of solomon he wanted his beloved but you know what he wanted to he wanted the little foxes too you can't have both can of both little foxes will spoil the vine every single time he wanted both and the bible says that that he takes takes this in it came to pass verse 4 brother jeremy and it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after the other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god and solomon verse 6 did evil in the sight of the lord and went not what a word and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully in other words it wasn't that he didn't go after the lord it's that he didn't go fully fully comes from the word full i know that's deep he didn't go fully after the lord he wasn't fully committed he kept just a portion he didn't go fully after the lord as did david his father in other words what was the difference between solomon and david yes they had both had mistakes the difference was is david went fully after the lord david wasn't trying to live in sin and live in the church he wasn't trying to live for god for his beloved and have his foxes too david might have made mistakes i make make i make many mistakes you make many mistakes but i say lord my heart is fully after you i don't desire to do those things i don't have it in my heart i may mess up tomorrow morning but it's not in my heart oh god my heart is to serve you oh can you say amen tonight my heart is to love you lord my heart is to be a servant of the lord though i may might make many mistakes brother baron i make so many mistakes sister bruce said oh sister bruce sister bruce god doesn't look at your mistakes god looks at your heart i'm so thankful for that lord the bible says notice this and solomon and evil not went fully after the lord as david there as did david his father come away i thought about that i read that this morning solomon voice of my beloved come away my love my fair one come away but yet there was something holding solomon back how many times as the voice of the lord spoke to you and said come away come away fully come away commit fully jump all in get don't don't just come ankle deep don't just come knee deep don't just come out uh a neck deep get all the way into where you're floating in christ but something holds you back he went not fully after him first kings 11 verse 9 the lord was angry with solomon verse 9 brother jeremy first kings 11. and the lord was angry with solomon first kings 11 and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel first kings 11 9 that's second kings first kings 11 and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him more than once that's all you've got to read more than once brother madam says how many times is god obligated to come knocking on your heart's door once and if he ever knocks again it was grace and i'm here to say i am the product of not one knock but two and three and four and five and six and seven i'm a product of grace that he kept knocking on my heart's door the bible says he came knocking he he appeared unto him twice the lord god was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god which had appeared unto him twice he had jeopardized everything that he had he was going to give it all up with everything in his life now that kingdom that god had established through solomon was going to be ripped from solomon and given unto another man i would start another vicious cycle i'm going to preach about that lord willing next sunday it would start a pattern and a cycle from this one man would spin off just worse and worse and worse a spiraling effect all because the little foxes that spoiled his vine and that kingdom would be ripped from solomon god says i'm going to take it away every single bit of it away because why you've went after strange gods you've lost your anointing because of sin because sin always destroys the anointing of god out of your life sin always takes the anointing of god out of your life always you say i don't feel close to the lord i i just feel so distant how do you think you feel why do you think you feel that way jesus god says your sins have have separated you between you and your god that he will not hear god had lifted his hand from solomon and from that day when god lifted his hand the hedge that he puts around his children was was removed the bible says and the lord stirred up an adversary verse 14. notice this and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon haddad the edomite verse 23 the bible says and god stirred up another adversary raison the son of eleadah notice what was god going to do he was going to stir up an adversary to try to get his attention imagine that god is going to raise enemies to get his son's attention the bible says ch all chastisement judgment god judges sin and jesus says in revelations 3 as many as i love i rebuke and chastise be zealous therefore that's the admonishment be zealous therefore and repent but chastisement comes from the lord many times we blame it on the devil and it's actually our heavenly father who knows what's best many times some of the chastisement god sends people in our life to chastise us i know that hurts but it's the word many times god sends it and we blame it we blame it on satan we blame it on the devil we blame it on demon spirits and no doubt many times it is but god raises up an adversary to get solomon's to get solomon's attention you imagine if you were that king and suddenly one day you woke up and you just were irritated at solomon didn't know why but something in you said i want to attack that guy i had no idea but god was inspiring that man to do that the bible says it this way to harass him to harass him and even though the worst of that even out of his own household when jeroboam the bible says the servant of the son of a servant lifted up his hand against first kings 11 verse 26. notice this was an associate of solomon someone he had trusted put in charge of his house but this man stabs him in the back he stat he he he he he murders assassinates his character rebels against him and now solomon doesn't just have enemies on the outside now he has enemies on the inside you say why how did this happen because the hedge of god the hedge of protection was removed from his life because the anointing was out of his life because he didn't go fully after the lord there was something in his heart a place in his heart that he held a as we spoke this morning about ananias and sapphira just to hold just a little bit back yet the lord christ here the holy spirit had appeared to him twice anointed him gifted him gave him a mighty gift a mighty desire a mighty gift of wisdom and now because of sin the bible says that solomon goes in the latter part of his life the twilight of his life and he builds the high places of shemath and of bell of of of strange gods this was david's son but how very different he was how very different he ran his church how very different he conducted himself how very different he looked in the mirror and viewed himself than how david when he looked in the mirror and viewed himself his perception was different his attitude was different solomon almost in every way was so different than his father the bible says it that way that he didn't go fully after the lord as did david his father and now he says in in ver in chapter five song of solomon chapter five brother jeremy verse six if you want to put that up on the screen i opened now this is solomon speaking here i opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone i opened to my beloved but now solomon's gonna start to tell you about his life i opened but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul felled when he spoke i sought him but i could not find him i called him but he gave me no answer do you know that what happens to solomon is exactly what david feared what happened to himself after the sin with bathsheba and that's why david prays in psalms 51 and says cast me not away from thy presence oh god don't take your holy spirit from me david wasn't saying that casually he was a man stricken with fear to say that one of the one of one of the most fearful things that could ever happen to me is for the lord to withdraw himself from my life oh i believe that to every believer here tonight we should say cast me not away from that presence o lord it should be one of the most fearful things for the holy spirit to withdraw from your life i could lose a lot but don't let me lose his presence he says i called to him but he gave me no answer you say oh that's wha what a what a what a tragedy but but don't forget friends this was this was solomon's choice this wasn't this wasn't an unfortunate event that happened to him it was his decision to take upon wives of strange gods concubines and take on more and more and more it's a pitiful man it's a pitiful state to be in as i as i preach this to you here tonight what a pitiful man who out of one side of his mouth wants the lord wants communion wants god but he wants his foxes too he wants to live for the lord oh i want that so much for my life oh i desire it so much but deep down inside he still wants to cling to his idols what a condition to be in on one side he's over here this was lusting on the other side he still wants to have the presence of his beloved but you can't have both you can't serve god and mammon you can't be with one foot in the world and one foot in church you can't sit on the fence you can't be jesus said i would rather you be hot or cold but because you're lukewarm i'll spew you out of my mouth he goes further than that solomon says here and i want you to as i turn a corner here to stay with me here this is going to be just a few more minutes notice solomon he he begins to lose the vision you notice this later in his life he loses his vision of his beloved the lord hadn't answered when he called because his sin had separated him between him and his god he had lost his love for the lord and he had gained lust for the world he the bible says begins to beget he was he was drunk literally drunk on the wine of lust whether has he gone if you find my beloved tell him i am heartsick for him he says but the substance is not there it is now a shadow a memory on the other side of the window beyond the lattice i see him notice what solomon is describing i see him through the lattice i catch his picture on the other side of the window i see him but he's distant from me it wasn't because the lord wanted to be distant it wasn't because the lord wanted to be ten miles away it's because your sin separated you between you and your god and you say brother matt how what would it have taken for solomon to get back to restored fellowship repentance it would have been that fast it would have been that quick you heard brother branham in the prayer line with that sister and and he comes up and the sisters comes up and just crying nervous brother man and says oh you're so worried sister he says you've fallen away from grace he says you've fallen away you've backslid he says now you now now who knows what this sister had done but he says you're away from the lord you're distant from the lord and you can hear yes sir brother and that's right yes sir brother you're distant from the lord right now he says now sister he says now you want to you want to come back she says yes he says you're back you're back just like that no get down on your knees and cry he says you want to be you're distant from the lord you're away from the lord you want to be back this is how quick you're going to be back you're back just like that brother branham says that rock that followed them in the wilderness he says though they went sinning though they turn and heart in their hearts he says yet that rock followed them all the way through the wilderness it was never going to leave them it was always there all the time and brother branham says where is restored fellowship it's right around the corner all you've got to do is repent and it doesn't take days it doesn't take months it doesn't take years it can happen in an instant out of fellowship with god but now with the desire to be back in fellowship with god you're back i say hallelujah that's my god that's the god that i serve he doesn't make me do penance and hail mary's and and and do all kinds of things to be restored and if you want to be restored tonight and you feel distant and far away from god he's right here right now ready to restore you all you got to say is lord i want to come home i want to come back and with the true repentant heart god says you're back just like that you're back but he says i see i seen through the lattice oh what a description i seen through the window the same man who in first kings chapter 8 says the lord god of israel there's no god like thee this is solomon who keepest covenants covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts who shut the heavens when thy people sin against thee and when a man shall know the plague of his own heart and shall call on the lord he will forgive if a man sins and god is angry if he return with all his heart and soul god will hear and forgive this is solomon then the lord will never forsake or leave him but will maintain the calls of his servant ecclesiastes 12 1 solomon says remember the lord while you are young for the day will come when you will find no more pleasure in anything remember now thy creator in the days of the youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them emptiness vanity brokenness that's how this man i i'm sorry i wish i could i wish i had a good highlight to give you i wish his life didn't end that way but this is what the bible says he turns away from his beloved solomon becomes a builder he spends time you notice his life is spent with uh you know planning and building and planning and grandeur and splendor and he's contracting all of this work and contracting all of the materials and he's going to build a great big grand he has this great vision this great man of great vision and inspiration and and is going to build this great house of the lord you notice all of the solomon's kingdom even today it's spoken of by by secular historians would say that that solomon had the most grandeus glorious kingdom it was grand just it was glorious it was it was a he was a man of great projects he was busy busy busy busy busy busy busy but he had no time to come away my love my fair one come away no time to come to the lord and spend just a moment with his beloved he wanted to build this magnificent pools and vineyards and gardens and orchards built the greatest temple in the world spent 13 years building a magnificent glorious palace he's the the designed you the the designs that he had takes from the cedar trees of the forest of lebanon constructs the great hall of judgment and fortresses and stone cities and and great watchtowers and and great walls and great gates six miles east of jerusalem he designs and plants a great garden with orchards and just the the just such glory and such splendor great reservoirs and and and aqueducts to carry water from jerusalem to all the cities in the in the to the surrounding cities becomes a cattleman breeds great cattle and sheep and oxen the bible says he had 14 000 chariots and 12 000 horsemen josephus historian jewish historians said his chariot drivers had long flowing hair powdered with gold dust and wore tunics of purple except for the matt while the description because i'm trying to get you to understand this was a man who had all of his priorities in the wrong place you can build such a beautiful wonderful outward christian image but be so dead on the inside you can build such a wonderful beautiful perfect refined message lifestyle and have all of your teas crossed and all of your eyes dotted but miss the most important thing it wasn't the glory of the gold that made your temple great solomon it wasn't the splendor of your purple it wasn't the scarlet that made that gave the glory to the temple what gave the glory to your temple solomon was the holy spirit that would come and dwell in that inner tabernacle that's what brought glory and let me say this to you my brother my sister it is your hair's hair style your long hair your long dresses your your your lifestyle and whatever however you want to describe your descriptors if that's not your glory it speaks of a greater glory that's within it is the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble and i say god give us good a good clean holy ghost life but make sure lord let us make sure that our people are not just stan images on the outside but let us have a reality of christ on the inside of our hearts can you say a man tonight is that how you feel tonight to say lord give me more than an image i want more than an image i want more than a story i want the literal life of the holy spirit i want the outside to be a reflective reflector of a god who's on the inside can you say a man such glory such splendor but oh he comes to the end even even the queen of sheba the bible says she was left breathless when she beheld solomon's magnificent splendor the way his men conducted himself the way they went up his cupbearers those who set the table sorry queen if she was just gasped she she's left without anything to say love breathless the bible says but what she doesn't know is that she leaves and solomon descends and devolves into one of the most loneliest coldest calloused men that you read about in the bible all of all of his projects all of his glory are you still here am i okay going a little bit longer i hope that's okay here tonight for sunday night all of his projects all of all of everything that he had built all everything that he had yet he ends his life just disillusioned disillusioned with life some of the things he begins to say about life they're almost suicidal go read it in ecclesiastes just dark and as he he comes to the very end of his of his life and his heart grows cold he begins he becomes so backslidden all he could he could say in all of his projects all of his labor he says in ecclesiastes 2 10 my heart rejoiced in all my labor labor but but then you find him in ecclesiastes 2 verse 11 he says then i looked on all the work that my hands had wrought and all that i had accomplished and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no prophet under the sun therefore i hated life the work that i did became a grief to me he says in verse 20 i was left in despair what a what a what a life how sad a man with vision a man with drive a man with a dream a man with a man with a plan a man with great inspiration but a man with great pomp and great glory and great limelight and at the end of it all solomon says it was all a it waste all a waste you know but there was such a difference in that attitude and the attitude of the apostle paul when apostle paul says all of the education learned under gamalia learned in the greatest schools but i counted it all as dung that i may know him paul said it was all wasted it was all wasted only what's done for christ matters how very different how very sad this man was in his life how very different this solomon tabernacle represents the spirit of the age we live in the bible says that america the spirit of the american age the american church brother branham said it was a lukewarm cold formal powerless church that named religion that had all the religious acts and all of the religious code had all said all the right things but was cold formal and powerless a church of america like very much like solomon a sensual a sensual church solomon the son of david we read at the beginning ii chronicles 1 1 was strengthened in his kingdom the lord as god was with him and he magnified him greatly very much like the prosperous church today who has all of the greatest temples and greatest churches and greatest choirs and oh they don't call them choirs now they call them bands worship bands all the greatest worship bands and all the cool preachers and all of the their cool genes that are faded and has holes in them would you like if i preach like that to you came in here holy blue jeans literally holy they have the greatest coolest hairstyles and coolest you know bands and and greatest you know in the greatest um uh pyrotechnics and and and smoke generators and blue lights and red lights and and every kind of light color you could think of to get the people going to hype them up to get them going prosperous yet they take those churches and they fill up with thousands and thousands and thousands of people and so much they have a eight o'clock service and 9 o'clock service at 10 o'clock service 11 o'clock service just to fit everybody into here now let me ask you something what do you think they're preaching it's amazing because they say they're preaching the gospel of jesus christ well when jesus preached his gospel it got him crucified when paul preached that gospel it got his head cut off when peter preached that gospel got him hung upside down on a cross yet somehow when they preach that gospel it fills up the church with thousands and thousands and thousands of people ought to tell you what they're preaching that's why paul would say i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ and he would only make that statement if there was something that the world looked as shameful are you here that was free it wasn't on my notes so you don't owe me nothing for it but it's a modern type of today it's the ladies in church great greater and knowledge the bible says ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth more information greater eloquence greater teaching greater uh articulate speakers with great rivers of wealth of information with great wealth of information from theology schools they can speak just to get a doctorate i think our master in theology i forget to think you got to speak five four languages whatever it is and and they they come with the grant of the greatest education out of the greatest cemeteries i mean seminaries as brother branham would say with some of the greatest teaching and and some of them i respect no i'm not to to to be careful here for a minute i'm not disparaging those people i'm disparaging that system because there's good people there's people going to heaven in that church oh yeah brother adam says i'm not against the people it's the spirit i'm crying out again but you notice here even the wisdom of solomon's gospel it was so different this is this is so so different than the way god looks at wisdom the bible says first corinthians 1 verse 21 for after that the scripture we read for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe in whom colossians 2 3 in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge yet when you look at solomon the bible says and he spoke 3 000 notice this first kings 4 verse 32 and he spoke thousand proverbs his songs were a thousand and five and he spoke of trees from the cedar tree if you could first kings chapter four verse 32 and he spoke of three thousand proverbs the songs this is solomon here i still got you for maybe 10 more minutes is that okay and he says he spoke of 3 000 proverbs his psalms were a thousand and five verse 33 and he spoke of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spoke also a beast and a fowl and of creeping things and of fishes this was solomon's gospel three thousand we could call sermonettes spoke of trees and cedar trees of lebanon and hyssop and springeth out of the wall he spoke of beast and a fowl and of creepy things proverbs good proverbs very good very good love love going through the book of proverbs read some of the most greatest insights on life out of proverbs some that i'm sure you've not even read before but yet all of this notice this what this was great applications of truth you can read many through the book of proverbs get good marital advice get good child rearing advice destruction our instructions on how to cope and how to behave how to be blessed solomon was a great preacher great gifted gifted preacher very articulate but he lacked one thing an anointing and brother when you lack the anointing of the holy ghost you could have all the greatest phrases all of the greatest uh instructions on wisdom you could have some of the most articulate things but if it lacks the unction of the power of the holy ghost paul said when i came to you i came not in the excellency of man's speech but i came in power and demonstration of the holy spirit we don't need more sermonettes with greater theology we need the power of the holy ghost i say lord don't just give us great fancy sermons and beautiful stories that make people cry give us the power of the holy ghost and don't just give me an emotion where i just speak in tongues that's good but let that power be able to have the power to break the grip of the enemy off people's lives let that power of the holy ghost be powerful enough to save the unbeliever oh can you say a man tonight let our preaching save and convict the sinner let it fill him with the baptism of the holy ghost i say god give me a gospel that can cause me to live above sin give me a salvation that gives me a nature that's not my own nature but a nature that lives like jesus lived you believe that what a difference this was what a difference oh my i can just become so joyful thinking about this when i think of the difference between solomon's sermons and david's sermons the bible says david the driving what was the driving force behind david's ministry david's the driving force the core the center was one thing total and complete dependence on the holy ghost total and complete dependence on the unction first samuel chapter 16 verse 13 first samuel 16 13. then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst notice it doesn't say that he took david and sat him in a school before theologians and scribes and educated david and made sure he could rehearse and recite the hebrew language no the bible says he anointed him with an anointing oil what was the power and might of david it wasn't his intellect it was his god who he served it was the mighty god who stood behind a little man named david it was an anointing upon his life you believe the word saying man to the word when david was on his deathbed he comes to solomon and he says in second samuel chapter 23 verse 2 he comes to last words he's going to speak to his son he's going to say this is this is this is what gave me my success solomon i want to tell you why god has blessed me are you hearing me tonight david says i want to tell you why my kingdom has been established why god could save david for for your kingdom will be established your throne will be established forever your throne oh david will be established forever why was my throne established forever what was the key to my success second samuel 23 verse 2. i want to tell you solomon i want you to know the secret of my life what unlocked the key what unlocked the door my kingdom is at peace solomon why god has blessed me everywhere i've went everywhere i've gone this is my last words to you solomon i'm gonna give you the secret the spirit of the lord spoke by me notice what god says it wasn't the wisdom of man it wasn't your intellect it wasn't your great stories of trees and hyssop of lebanon and beast of the field and fouls it was the spirit of the lord spoke by me and his word his word his word was in my tongue oh that ought to make you shout tonight i said his spirit was upon me solomon this was the key to my success the spirit of the lord spoke by me and his word was in my tongue i wonder if you could say tonight lord i don't need education i don't need great uh great pomp and great limelight and great glory and great outside grandeur i need the spirit of the lord to speak by me and i need your word to be on my tongue i need your thoughts to be my thoughts i need your actions oh can you raise a hand and say lord i need that tonight god i need this word i need this message spoken by a prophet i need that word to come live through me o god the spirit of the lord spoke by me what was david saying david said i didn't trust in my own ability i didn't trust in my own knowledge i didn't trust in my own gift i didn't trust in any part of my flesh because when i did my flesh messed up my flesh disappointed me i found myself empty and broken nothing but a failure oh i was a weak man solomon i wasn't a strong man on the outward since i was a weak man full of faults full of failures but i depended on the holy ghost and every word when i spoke was the word of the lord his words filled my mouth my speech oh musicians could you return first corinthians chapter 2 verse 4 paul says in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom stand to your feet if you could paul says in first corinthians 2 verse 4 he says in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom i love this but in demonstration of the spirit and of power let me read that again to you my speech this is paul and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom let me tell you something brother branham's speech was not enticing words of man's wisdom wasn't how well he spoke how articulate he was paul says but in demonstration of the spirit and of power and i say god make me a believer that that has the demonstration and the power of the holy spirit [Music] let my life be more than just outside action outside of words just just saying the right things the right phrases memorizing oh that's good that's good to memorize good to good to know the word very good but lord let that be come off of ink on paper let it become a life that's lived out can you want do you want that say lord let it become beyond a tape that i hear it goes into my ear and then i goes into my mind then i reason it then i think about it let it drop further than my mind let it drop into my heart oh god may that word become anointed fresh bow your heads with me if you could every have doubt ever i closed i want to build the rebuild i want to be a tabernacle of david how many could say that by an uplifted hand not of solomon oh i could i could reflect tonight oh as all of you can we can reflect on how our life may be in certain ways you could identify and say i've been right where he was that my life has been reflective more of solomon maybe distant sometimes from the lord from the holy spirit maybe felt like i was just sinning through the lattice seeing him out the window but oh god that's not what's in my heart my heart's to be in that secret inner chamber and fellowship with you one on one and that holiest of holies where that word becomes real where that word becomes more than a cliche where it becomes more than a lifestyle more than a dress code more than just a law more than a book of laws if i do and i don't and i do and i don't i want to i want to go and let that veil drop behind me i want to go to that inner chamber i want it to be an automatic life by the holy spirit directing me calling me controlling me anointing me choosing uh choosing where i go where i don't go what i say what i don't say oh i see hands lifted up all over the building god you see all those hands identified you see the desire of their heart lord is the desire of mine as i raise my hands up with every single one of them how i can identify many times lord shamefully lord all of us here sinners saved by grace how lord many times you knocked on my heart [Music] oh and [Music] many times lord i've turned you away turned aside done the wrong thing when i could have done the right thing said the wrong thing when i could have said the right thing how many times lord i've i've failed you lord over and over and over again but how many more times your grace reaches out your mercy reaches out and your grace is there one more time to say get up child keep moving son keep moving daughter i'm not going to give up on you my faithfulness is to the end my faithfulness is not based upon your behavior my faithfulness is eternal you want to be restored as brother adam told that little sister oh you've been far you've been distant away from god you want to get back to god yes brother branham you're back you're back just like that oh lord how we want to hear that voice here tonight maybe distant from you maybe in our spirits lord maybe we've never even known you we want to say like paul that i may know you that i may know you lord that i may know you in the power of your resurrection in the fellowship of your sufferings lord let me know you in a way that changes me let me know you in a way that makes me a different person or i can know that i'm not the creature who i once was but i'm new i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man let it be jesus let it be to each and every single one here tonight let it be father that's the desire of our heart oh as isaiah says i see the lord high and lifted up in this train-filled temple let us see you lord in that way high and lift it up oh god let us raise you out of history as the prophet said raising you up out of yesterday bringing you to today to a lost and dying world that is looking for answers has all the questions doesn't have any answers and here we've been given the very key of david we've been given lord we have a revelation of who that key is of who the door is of what the door is and what the key to the door is that you have an elected family that you knew before the foundation of the world that we didn't choose you but you chose us we didn't call us you called us we didn't save us you saved us lord let us walk worthy as the apostle paul says of the vocation wherewith you are called let us walk worthy of it tonight jesus i pray in our lives and our testimony let us let our testimony in the community father let our let our associates at work oh lord if anything let our family know that we're different we're believers we have convictions we stand for truth we stand for the word of god let it let them know by by this will all men know that you are my disciples that you have love one for another let it be jesus oh i raise my hands if you want to raise yours to the lord god's watching just say lord that's my desire that's my prayer tonight let me be a written epistle read and known of all men let it be real oh i every head bowed ever i closed just tarry in here for a moment i believe it's the holy spirit let it be real let it be real lord oh god it's what we need today lord it's what this church needs that's what my my life needs it's what my family that's what our families need that's what our marriages need that's what our teenagers need they needed to be real lord a real living experience let it be real oh god to each and every single individual here tonight let that experience be something that they can have they can't can depend upon mom can't depend upon dad can depend upon the pastor can depend upon this person or that person it's not a it's not just an idea it's not something we agree with it's not just because we believe it but that we know it that we've met it that we have a relationship with not it but you lord the message is not doctrines it's not quotes it's not tapes it's a person and that person is jesus christ that we may know him that we may know you experientially lord that we may know you let it be father i make that invitation every single person here tonight i make this altar open to every single person here tonight young person old person you want to know jesus he's here you could come and meet him you don't you don't have to come you can do it right there at your seat at the heart at the altar of your heart you want to know him tonight by the power of his resurrection you want to know him beyond what solomon knew him you want to know him you want to say lord i want your words i want you your spirit to be upon my life to speak through my lips i'll give you that invitation now this altar is open we'll pray with you want an experience in the baptism of the holy ghost to where you can say like the apostle paul it's no longer i that liveth but it's christ that liveth in me oh listen young people god brother adam says he only has the knock on your heart one time that tug you feel that feeling that you feel that pull that you feel he only has to pull one time it'll be mercy if he ever does it again today's the day of salvation not tomorrow [Music] that 17 year old boy i told you about this morning i believe he was his testimonies he was serving the lord had no idea that was his last day on earth had no idea when he woke up that morning brushed his teeth got dressed had no idea he'd he'd enter he'd leave this dimension and he'd enter another dimension brother adam says that doesn't change you death doesn't change you it just changes your address what you are there is what you were here what you are there is reflective of what you were here and there's only one thing that matters and that's that the blood of jesus christ atones for you that you've accepted him into your heart as your personal savior it's as simple an imitation as that but jesus is still calling jesus is still saving it doesn't matter how old you are doesn't matter how young you are doesn't matter how few of days you've been at church doesn't matter how many years you've sat on a pew do you know him do you really know him tonight [Music] yes lord yes lord jesus [Music] believe it lord still calling still saving [Music] still calling sinners to repentance still calling those that are bound addicted you can still set them free some are coming you can come tonight still setting free still healing still saving still forgiving
