[38:44] oh

[39:07] [Music]
[39:12] god you're standing we have a
[39:16] couple of requests to bring your
[39:17] attention
[39:20] brother jordan sent a text a little
[39:22] while ago they were at home still
[39:24] doing better and lord willing the family
[39:26] would be here on sunday so
[39:29] we're trusting in that and got a text
[39:32] update from sister rachel
[39:34] lopez about sister aggie they had taken
[39:37] her off the ventilator and she was
[39:39] improving
[39:40] and suddenly her lungs filled back up
[39:42] again they had to put her back on a
[39:44] ventilator
[39:46] so it's been a struggle but we still
[39:49] know god still moves
[39:50] so let's remember the lopez family
[39:54] and then my daughter nina sent us a text
[39:56] for a friend of hers
[39:58] they had taken to the hospital and she
[40:00] was
[40:01] not feeling well at all and they found
[40:03] some cysts and some blood clots in her
[40:05] heart
[40:06] and so she asked that we would remember
[40:08] her in prayer today and i told her we
[40:10] would
[40:11] so if you can believe all things are
[40:15] possible
[40:16] amen so let's just just bow our hands as
[40:18] we pray lord
[40:20] you've heard the requests and you see
[40:21] everyone here
[40:23] and you know their hearts lord and their
[40:25] desires and their needs
[40:27] and those that might be listening in
[40:29] today or or streaming or
[40:31] wherever they might be some may be
[40:33] working some may be traveling lord and
[40:35] there may be some lord that are just
[40:36] down in the dumps today
[40:38] disappointed over events or whatever it
[40:40] might be lord
[40:42] but if you'll draw an eye to them like
[40:44] you did those walking
[40:46] on the way to emmaus lord and they were
[40:49] headed back home they thought it was all
[40:51] over lord but
[40:52] you drew nigh to them lord draw an eye
[40:54] to each one tonight lord
[40:56] and encourage every heart lord for your
[40:58] honor and your glory because you still
[41:00] move lord
[41:01] we love you for that in jesus christ's
[41:03] day
[41:05] amen so we have a praise also
[41:08] from my niece eunice needs and her and
[41:11] ava had
[41:12] had been sick and the pediatrician was
[41:14] able to check ava said
[41:16] she was doing well there was nothing
[41:17] wrong that she would be able to return
[41:19] to to school on monday
[41:21] and eunice she had was tested for covet
[41:24] and she's believing that the results
[41:25] will be good
[41:26] so let's believe together we know he's
[41:28] the same yesterday today
[41:30] and while you're standing and they're
[41:32] standing too we have with us today
[41:36] brother john and sister ruthie god from
[41:38] walnut ridge arkansas
[41:40] from brother david morris's church there
[41:42] and for those of you that were here a
[41:44] long time ago and you remember
[41:46] joshua hernandez they're good friends
[41:49] and attend the church there with him and
[41:52] and brother joshua told me he called me
[41:53] and said did they make it they made it
[41:55] last sunday but i didn't get a chance to
[41:57] really
[41:57] talk to them but he told me that we have
[41:59] something in common see he has six
[42:01] daughters too
[42:03] so um i thought if all the girls were
[42:06] here i'd have them sit there so they'd
[42:08] feel at home but
[42:09] you know god bless you brother and
[42:11] sister good to have you
[42:13] god bless
[42:18] thank you musicians and appreciate the
[42:21] grace of god let's read that first
[42:22] scripture there
[42:24] while you're still standing out of
[42:26] second timothy
[42:29] chapter one and we'll be read seven and
[42:31] twelve
[42:33] i was telling brother lyle on sunday
[42:36] there was
[42:37] knowing we'd be speaking tonight lord
[42:39] willing that there were so many thoughts
[42:41] how do you
[42:42] marshal them into one but i felt that
[42:45] after brother matt spoke on sunday it
[42:48] kind of aligned in a certain direction
[42:50] so
[42:51] but for god hath not given us the spirit
[42:54] of fear
[42:56] that tells us there is a spirit of fear
[42:59] but he didn't give it to us
[43:00] but of power and of love and a sound
[43:03] mind it says
[43:05] uh a spirit of timid timidity or
[43:08] cowardness
[43:09] backing away being afraid no he says
[43:12] but a spirit of love a power of love and
[43:15] a sound mind discipline
[43:17] self-control sound judgment
[43:20] and if you'll stay with what god's word
[43:22] says
[43:23] judgment it never fails and then verse
[43:26] 12
[43:28] he says this in verse 12 he said
[43:31] for this cause which cause i also suffer
[43:34] these things now this is paul saying
[43:36] and we heard that on wednesday night we
[43:40] must suffer it's a promise
[43:43] not the promises we look for but through
[43:46] all the suffering he makes away in
[43:48] how he said nevertheless i am not
[43:49] ashamed for i know
[43:52] whom i have believed he says and
[43:55] am persuaded that he is able to keep
[43:59] that which i've committed unto him
[44:01] against that day
[44:02] that which i've entrusted to him and say
[44:04] lord hear
[44:06] i put in your hands amen god bless you
[44:09] the word of god is you may be seated the
[44:11] word of god never fails
[44:13] it'll never return void so
[44:17] just uh a reminder to before i forget
[44:20] brother andrew glover will be here
[44:22] this weekend with us for sunday weekend
[44:25] and
[44:26] so lord willing
[44:30] we'll have a good time you come under
[44:33] expectation
[44:35] god said where two or three are gathered
[44:37] i'll be in their midst you know and
[44:39] sometimes it's it's not because he fails
[44:41] it's because
[44:42] you know we come as humans sometimes and
[44:44] we're weak we're tired we're
[44:45] disappointed we've had a
[44:47] a rough day or maybe got some
[44:49] disappointing
[44:50] information or news and it's heavy on
[44:52] the heart
[44:54] but god said i'll not leave you where
[44:57] two or three are gathered he says so
[44:59] remember that there also and come under
[45:02] expectation believing that so
[45:04] brother peter spoke several wednesdays
[45:06] ago and and there was just one thought
[45:08] and i'd like to
[45:09] just bring that poor part of it where he
[45:12] said
[45:13] the the inoculation and i was at home
[45:16] still under
[45:16] quarantine and i was listening and i
[45:19] made a couple of notes
[45:21] and and i thought about the inoculation
[45:23] of it
[45:24] and and you realize the inoculation is
[45:26] eternal
[45:28] it never fell he's always been there he
[45:30] was a lamb slain from before the
[45:32] foundation of the world
[45:34] already had made provision i said this
[45:36] here when we spoke last time
[45:38] he put a lamb in the garden for a reason
[45:42] he knew what that reason was going to be
[45:45] so but the virus is temporal
[45:49] it has its end it has its finish so
[45:54] you know that inoculation the spirit of
[45:56] god
[45:57] if that same spirit that
[46:00] raised christ from the dead dwells in
[46:03] you it
[46:04] will quicken your mortal body i know a
[46:06] lot of people have said and we we kind
[46:08] of lean this way sometimes
[46:09] oh when i get to heaven all this will be
[46:12] over and that is true
[46:14] but it will quicken your mortal body the
[46:17] body you're in now
[46:19] so there's a promise for today and and
[46:21] we do that so
[46:23] the thought of that there where where
[46:25] the
[46:26] the inoculation is eternal amen it's the
[46:29] benefit plan that brother greene used to
[46:31] say
[46:32] it's it's no nothing like you know
[46:35] amen and then of course we brother
[46:38] lyle when he spoke of of suffering
[46:42] is part of the promises of god but in
[46:45] suffering character is built in
[46:48] suffering we learn
[46:50] our lessons and not only that but
[46:52] because you suffered you have compassion
[46:53] and mercy on somebody else that's going
[46:55] through
[46:55] and you can share with this is how god
[46:59] gave me this
[47:00] is how you know and um i was talking to
[47:03] my brother yesterday and they they're
[47:05] still
[47:05] doing some some testing about
[47:08] the cancer they they say they found in
[47:10] his esophagus and
[47:12] one of the other ones they thought in
[47:13] his lower back they could be cancer they
[47:15] found it was just a scar from an injury
[47:17] and some things but he went and he and
[47:20] he and he went to visit his doctor his
[47:22] regular doctor and
[47:24] he was having a lot of trouble with
[47:25] athena's body and he gave him a simple
[47:27] solution
[47:28] take a half a teaspoon of baking soda
[47:31] every day
[47:33] and and he said these last four days
[47:36] have been the best four days i've had
[47:38] and sometimes
[47:39] somebody has something god has done for
[47:41] them and they can share it with you
[47:44] and of course knowing me i had just
[47:48] i was cleaning out the tub and the
[47:50] drains and the in the sink in the tub
[47:52] and i had just used a huge cup of baking
[47:54] soda and a thing of vinegar and i said
[47:56] it really works it cleaned out the tub
[47:59] and he goes that sounds like you all
[48:00] right you know
[48:02] but god provides for our needs
[48:05] and and we appreciate his grace and his
[48:07] mercy to us so
[48:09] looking at some of those things and then
[48:11] brother matt especially
[48:12] god knows here and god knows here
[48:16] and he knows all the in between two
[48:19] and sometimes an answer even if it's a
[48:22] no
[48:24] and and we you would say lord if you'll
[48:26] just give me an answer i'll know how to
[48:28] proceed
[48:29] i'll know if i need to go this way but
[48:32] you know sometimes in waiting
[48:34] character is built patience is built
[48:38] lord i need patience but give it to me
[48:40] quickly you know
[48:43] the microwave version stick it in and
[48:45] it's done quickly
[48:46] no it's a lifelong
[48:50] experience so god is god has been good
[48:53] to us
[48:54] and he said i will never leave you so
[48:57] taking this thoughts and and
[49:00] we had been speaking of of eternity
[49:04] and there's no way to harness eternity
[49:06] and into our own thoughts and into a
[49:08] couple of services because it takes
[49:10] eternity to do that
[49:12] but god's word is eternal every part of
[49:15] it
[49:16] and so the thought today
[49:19] is why fear
[49:23] why should i fear now fear is real
[49:29] how many can testify the fear is real
[49:32] how many have been
[49:33] paralyzed by a situation where you can't
[49:35] move you can't go you don't know what to
[49:37] do
[49:39] coming home one day driving home my wife
[49:41] and my daughter
[49:42] had gone up to phoenix to pick up some
[49:44] cabinets for the company and i picked
[49:46] them up on the way out
[49:47] and somebody ran an intersection right
[49:49] in front of us and
[49:50] hit somebody and killed the person right
[49:52] in front of us and myself and another
[49:54] lady were the only ones there
[49:55] and we had to attend to it and the 45
[49:59] minutes
[50:00] hour of that time i just did what i
[50:02] needed to do
[50:04] we got it all they finally let us go the
[50:07] next intersection i came up to
[50:09] i slowed down almost stopped looked both
[50:12] ways
[50:12] all the way home even if there was a
[50:16] stoplight there
[50:18] because suddenly that fear of what had
[50:19] happened what i saw
[50:21] was there but he's not
[50:24] given us a spirit of fear
[50:28] we sometimes let it come upon us i i'm
[50:31] not saying it's not there it's there
[50:33] but we take god's word and we stand on
[50:36] that
[50:37] and sometimes we have to say lord help
[50:40] me
[50:41] i'm struggling through this i'm going
[50:42] through a hard time
[50:44] but john says saint john here
[50:49] first john 3 1-2 behold what manner of
[50:54] love
[50:55] the father has to be bedout upon us
[50:58] not just in word but indeed with action
[51:02] with effectiveness
[51:03] he says that we should be called the
[51:06] sons of god
[51:08] therefore the world knoweth us not
[51:10] because it knew him not
[51:12] uh john puts it in it he says if you're
[51:14] if the people are looking you're
[51:15] thinking your words strange he goes
[51:16] they did that to him so what difference
[51:18] it would be with you
[51:20] and let's look at verse 2. beloved
[51:24] now we are the sons of god and it doth
[51:27] not yet appear what we shall be because
[51:29] you look at this guy and sometimes
[51:31] boy that ain't very godly at times if
[51:34] that's god i'm disappointed
[51:37] but he says but we know that
[51:40] when he shall appear we shall be like
[51:42] him for we shall see him
[51:44] as he is and when you begin to see these
[51:47] things that god put in his word for
[51:50] us you can take courage
[51:53] and say i don't need to fear
[51:56] god has seen this from this
[51:59] already and he has seen me there
[52:02] brother greene said this one time and
[52:04] brother branham told him that
[52:06] he says now you and billy were friends
[52:08] here
[52:09] and there's going to be this time but
[52:12] you'll be friends again here
[52:15] brother green's talked about the times
[52:17] like this too
[52:18] but a promise over here and that's what
[52:21] we hold on to
[52:23] brother matt used a scripture he said i
[52:26] go to prepare a place for you and if i
[52:29] go
[52:30] he says i'll come back did he go so will
[52:33] he come back
[52:35] and will he take us with him amen what a
[52:37] promise we have let's
[52:38] let's read the the first two quotes that
[52:41] they gave
[52:43] the brothers there to and this part of
[52:46] it
[52:47] if i could call i just want to say this
[52:50] portion of it
[52:51] if if leaves
[52:54] a lot of room for things i'll be going
[52:58] over
[52:58] if this happens if i can get off on time
[53:01] if
[53:02] we can go to out to eat if i got enough
[53:05] money you know what i mean the if
[53:07] it becomes one of the most important
[53:08] words in that sentence
[53:11] if that same spirit that raised christ
[53:14] from the dead
[53:15] dwells in you so this just portion of it
[53:18] is
[53:19] settle that if in your life
[53:24] make sure what does it say make sure of
[53:27] your own salvation
[53:29] look at your own calling not because god
[53:31] doesn't know
[53:32] but you need to settle it god settled it
[53:35] already
[53:36] but sometimes you have to have that
[53:38] assurance you have to look at it and
[53:39] said
[53:40] work out your own salvation with fear
[53:42] and trouble get it
[53:43] settled in your life and brother brahm
[53:45] says romans 8 11 but if
[53:48] there is a problem there's his catch but
[53:50] if the spirit of god of him god the holy
[53:53] spirit that raised up jesus from the
[53:54] dead dwell in you
[53:56] now there you are if the bridegroom
[53:58] spirit dwells
[54:00] in the bride they are one
[54:04] it should be adam and eve eve was in
[54:07] adam already
[54:10] you were part of him he knew you from
[54:12] before the foundation of the world
[54:14] you have to see yourself in that
[54:16] position that place
[54:19] when god made his first bridegroom he
[54:21] made the
[54:22] bridegroom first and he was both man and
[54:25] woman
[54:25] in spirit formed him in the dust of the
[54:27] earth to make him material
[54:30] now notice when he made eve
[54:36] okay let's let me get to my place here
[54:39] and notice when he made eve
[54:40] from adam he took not another piece of
[54:43] clay
[54:43] he took from the same piece of clay the
[54:46] same word
[54:47] for adam was a spoken word see he took
[54:50] from him
[54:51] and then taken he had the masculine and
[54:54] feminist spirit
[54:55] he took the feminist spirit away from
[54:57] adam and placed it in eve
[55:00] so it's still part of adam's spirit it's
[55:02] adam's flesh
[55:03] then it was adam's spirit the dynamic
[55:05] dynamic that quicken the mechanics of
[55:07] his body
[55:08] so the bride must also be flesh of his
[55:11] flesh and bone of his bone
[55:13] then how is this mortal flesh going to
[55:16] become his flesh
[55:18] and we'll get to it in a minute see how
[55:20] is it done how
[55:22] what is this great transformation now
[55:24] notice now if the spirit of him god
[55:27] that race of jesus from the dead dwell
[55:29] in you he
[55:30] that raised up christ from the dead
[55:32] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[55:34] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[55:38] so here we we see that that clue he's
[55:40] saying if
[55:41] and he ties adam and eve together
[55:45] and if you were part of him then it's
[55:48] tied together again
[55:50] we'll go to another quote following
[55:52] along that same line
[55:57] should be the rising of the sun god
[56:01] provide a place of worship
[56:02] okay romans 8 11
[56:05] it is if the spirit that raised up jesus
[56:07] from the dead be in you
[56:08] it will also quicken your mortal bodies
[56:11] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[56:12] the dead if it be in you
[56:14] it will also quicken your mortal bodies
[56:16] quicken it
[56:18] what does the word quick mean the greek
[56:20] word means to be brought to life
[56:22] after death hallelujah he says that's a
[56:24] gate of worship worshiping in the spirit
[56:27] and into truth
[56:28] mechanics and dynamics together you see
[56:30] what i mean
[56:31] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[56:33] the dead dwell in you
[56:35] it will quicken make alive your mortal
[56:37] bodies
[56:38] because it's already life
[56:41] it works in this body now
[56:46] sometimes you just have to be willing to
[56:48] yield and surrender to it
[56:49] and let god move he says
[56:54] and when it comes into your body it
[56:56] brings your whole body subject to it
[56:58] subject to what
[56:59] the word of god if it's in you now if
[57:02] it's something in you telling you well
[57:04] the days
[57:05] that was the days pass and mark 16 is
[57:07] not true and the pentecostal idea of the
[57:10] baptism of the holy ghost that
[57:12] ain't the spirit of god in you i don't
[57:14] care how well you're trained
[57:16] you it's not the spirit of god you say
[57:19] well my mother belonged to this and my
[57:20] father through the years of my brother
[57:23] whatever you want to say about your
[57:25] relatives and so forth that might have
[57:26] been all right with them
[57:28] but it ain't for you each individual
[57:32] must have the same experience
[57:35] okay
[57:38] i'm not a speed reader all right see
[57:41] you've got to have you've got to to this
[57:44] day come into christ jesus for this
[57:46] age and the promise that's meant for
[57:48] this age notice we find out that this
[57:50] great quickening power struck
[57:52] enoch at quickem and he went home
[57:55] without dying
[57:56] it struck elijah quickened him till he
[57:59] went home without dying
[58:00] we find out that his success successor
[58:03] was elisha
[58:04] which is a type thereof christ in the
[58:07] church
[58:08] elisha elijah done four miracles and
[58:10] like elisha done eight miracles
[58:12] he had a double portion like was poured
[58:15] upon the church
[58:17] later they had a dead man and we know
[58:18] they his bones were in that and that
[58:22] grave there throated on his bones and he
[58:24] come to life
[58:25] that quickening power was in the grave
[58:27] with him
[58:29] so you don't have to fear islam
[58:32] or south lawn or up here on i mean
[58:36] if they put your body in there that's
[58:38] okay
[58:40] because when he calls it's coming it's
[58:43] already
[58:43] he said it's already quickened in there
[58:46] he says
[58:50] so he says you can't it's always there
[58:52] when you get that quickening power of
[58:53] god being quickened up with him now
[58:55] now remember in christ we are flesh of
[58:58] his flesh
[58:58] bone of his bones when god wounded
[59:01] christ
[59:02] at calvary he was wounded for me and you
[59:05] we
[59:05] are flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[59:07] bone body of his body
[59:09] name of his name bride of him see
[59:13] we are in him we are his flesh and his
[59:15] bones
[59:16] and god has already raised us up
[59:18] potentially
[59:19] the quickening power that raised us up
[59:22] from a life of sin
[59:23] and changed our being it has potentially
[59:26] raises up in christ jesus which the
[59:28] resurrection will bring us forth
[59:30] in the full maturity so you can stand on
[59:34] that
[59:35] and say i don't have to fear i don't
[59:37] have to be afraid
[59:39] because if this body be destroyed i've
[59:42] got another one to step
[59:43] into remember brother branham talked
[59:45] about that and i think brother matt
[59:46] mentioned
[59:47] he was oh he had been afraid of death
[59:49] fear of death because
[59:50] he just thought what kind of body are we
[59:52] going to be we're just going to float
[59:53] around in heaven all the images
[59:56] and god gave him a few moments on the
[59:58] other side
[1:00:00] and i say this if god would give each
[1:00:02] one of us just a couple of moments on
[1:00:03] the other side
[1:00:05] this world would mean nothing at all
[1:00:07] anymore
[1:00:08] the fear of it all but he's given us
[1:00:10] glimpses when he comes and he ministers
[1:00:12] to you
[1:00:13] when he comes and he touches your body
[1:00:15] and makes it well when he comes and
[1:00:16] answers a question when a brother gets
[1:00:18] behind in ministers of god or you're
[1:00:20] listening to a tape
[1:00:21] and god begins to minister to you he's
[1:00:23] given you a glimpse
[1:00:25] of that quickening power because he's
[1:00:27] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:00:29] so make sure that if it's settled in
[1:00:32] your life
[1:00:33] and no question about it you know and
[1:00:36] and i know that some people say well i
[1:00:39] know i received the holy ghost and that
[1:00:40] set up but you know what
[1:00:42] you can walk with him and talk with him
[1:00:44] and meet with him every single day
[1:00:46] me and my wife we got married almost 42
[1:00:48] years ago
[1:00:50] and that wasn't the end of it we got
[1:00:52] married we're done no
[1:00:53] there's been a life to live i think now
[1:00:56] sometimes you can ask her and she'll say
[1:00:58] amen
[1:00:59] sometimes it's not that fun sometimes it
[1:01:01] gets rough
[1:01:02] sometimes it gets hard we've gone
[1:01:05] through
[1:01:05] two remodels in our life now at the
[1:01:08] house
[1:01:09] the first one lasted about four months
[1:01:11] when we added the bedroom all and
[1:01:13] one of the last statements she made to
[1:01:15] me is if your marriage can last to
[1:01:16] remodel
[1:01:17] it can last anything well we're
[1:01:20] being tried again we're in the middle of
[1:01:22] another remodel
[1:01:25] and she's like oh we're both at times
[1:01:27] like
[1:01:28] are you gonna do this when i get to it
[1:01:30] please you know
[1:01:31] i can't do everything today and then i
[1:01:33] turn on have you made dinner yet
[1:01:35] you know so but you know what
[1:01:39] we love each other we care for each
[1:01:41] other
[1:01:42] and even in the hard times and then you
[1:01:44] say hey
[1:01:46] i said yes you said yes for better for
[1:01:48] worse
[1:01:50] and thank the lord it's been better
[1:01:53] i don't know if she'd say that but i
[1:01:54] will
[1:01:56] but you know it god is with us he'll
[1:02:00] never leave us
[1:02:01] he said i'll be with you even in you to
[1:02:03] the end of the world so
[1:02:05] as we look at some of these things here
[1:02:07] and one more scripture in deuteronomy
[1:02:09] just just building a little bit of a
[1:02:10] base here
[1:02:11] deuteronomy 31 6.
[1:02:16] when joshua is there and he says be
[1:02:18] strong and have a good courage
[1:02:20] fear not nor be afraid of them
[1:02:24] and that them can be anything to joshua
[1:02:26] he was telling about crosstalk but for
[1:02:28] you and i
[1:02:29] that them whatever it is he says for the
[1:02:32] lord thy god
[1:02:34] he's your god he's not somebody else's
[1:02:37] god he's not the minister's god he's not
[1:02:39] the prophet's god he's not
[1:02:40] this one's god he's your god
[1:02:44] he says he he it is that doth go with
[1:02:47] thee
[1:02:48] and he will not fail thee nor forsake
[1:02:51] thee
[1:02:52] sometimes you just have to remind
[1:02:54] yourself what god's word says
[1:02:57] in the midst of the hard times in the
[1:02:59] midst of the of the troubles that we're
[1:03:01] going through at times so
[1:03:03] why should i fear why should i be afraid
[1:03:06] you know what are the things that that
[1:03:09] at times
[1:03:11] oh you just you would say oh my how can
[1:03:14] i go on
[1:03:15] what what what could i do what i just
[1:03:18] don't understand
[1:03:21] so let's look at psalms and we're going
[1:03:23] to go through two sections of psalms
[1:03:24] here
[1:03:25] psalms 91 verses 1 through 11.
[1:03:29] a couple of of well-known psalms here
[1:03:36] and um to think he that dwelleth
[1:03:41] in the secret place of the most high
[1:03:46] he says shall abide under the shadow of
[1:03:48] the almighty
[1:03:50] and i just thought of that it is a
[1:03:53] personal
[1:03:53] relationship it's not a
[1:03:57] a a group gathering in the sense that
[1:03:59] just because you're part of that group
[1:04:01] there is a group of people together but
[1:04:03] it better be personal to each one of you
[1:04:05] to each one of us to myself he says and
[1:04:08] he says i will say of the lord
[1:04:09] he is my refuge and my fortress
[1:04:13] my god in him will i trust
[1:04:16] and the thought that came as i was
[1:04:18] reading these the other night jesus
[1:04:19] thoughts came to me
[1:04:20] because by experience i know this
[1:04:23] by relationship i know this
[1:04:27] it's not because i read it in the book
[1:04:28] or because i saw somebody else
[1:04:30] but because i have experienced that he's
[1:04:33] been faithful
[1:04:35] he's never failed
[1:04:38] surely he shall deliver thee
[1:04:41] from the snare of the fowler and from
[1:04:44] the noisome pencil he will take you out
[1:04:46] of the bird net
[1:04:47] and keep you safe from the wasting
[1:04:49] diseases
[1:04:51] and you know we look at them we think of
[1:04:53] cancer we think of that
[1:04:55] but there's also sometimes just fatigue
[1:04:57] tired
[1:04:58] uh emotional stress that wastes you
[1:05:02] that tires you out i i was talking to a
[1:05:04] friend of mine
[1:05:06] of ours that they lost
[1:05:09] the brother lost his younger sister and
[1:05:11] younger brother just in the last
[1:05:13] two months that passed away and had not
[1:05:16] seen them for quite a while and they
[1:05:18] were talking about making some
[1:05:19] arrangements for the memorial service
[1:05:21] and all and and i said well how's mom
[1:05:24] doing
[1:05:26] we hadn't seen her for quite some time
[1:05:27] either and he said oh she's in a home
[1:05:30] care now
[1:05:32] a place where they take care of you and
[1:05:34] we haven't told her because she's kind
[1:05:36] of wasted away
[1:05:38] and so she doesn't know that two of her
[1:05:40] children have passed away
[1:05:43] because it would be we don't know how
[1:05:44] she would react we know what would
[1:05:46] happen
[1:05:47] but he said i'll keep you from that
[1:05:50] though job said though this body be
[1:05:53] destroyed in the skin
[1:05:54] i will know that i will see my redeemer
[1:05:58] there's something about it there's a
[1:05:59] hope there's something inside of me that
[1:06:01] says
[1:06:01] yes amen though it doesn't look that
[1:06:05] that's a promise of god here he will
[1:06:08] cover thee with his feathers
[1:06:10] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[1:06:13] truth
[1:06:14] shall be thy shield and buckler and this
[1:06:16] is nothing
[1:06:17] but the truth i can go to here and open
[1:06:20] it and say lord your word says
[1:06:23] your word says lord you keep it
[1:06:28] thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[1:06:31] by night
[1:06:32] nor for the arrow that flieth by day
[1:06:37] and another where they say thou shalt be
[1:06:39] kept
[1:06:40] from secret and open mischief
[1:06:43] at night and during the day i just like
[1:06:47] that little
[1:06:48] the way they put it there during the day
[1:06:50] and during the night he's still watching
[1:06:52] over you
[1:06:53] he doesn't go to bed and say i'm gonna
[1:06:54] set the alarm for six when you get up
[1:06:56] i'll get up with you no
[1:06:58] he's an ever-present help in the time of
[1:07:00] trouble
[1:07:02] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:07:05] darkness
[1:07:06] nor for the destruction that wastes that
[1:07:08] news
[1:07:09] invisibly so we can neither foresee nor
[1:07:12] prevent prevented
[1:07:14] this was john wesley's words there he
[1:07:17] says it's invisible he can't
[1:07:19] but he sees it and he protects you
[1:07:22] how many times how many testimonies have
[1:07:24] you heard when god has spoken and called
[1:07:26] somebody
[1:07:27] use somebody to call someone to warn
[1:07:29] brother branham said this
[1:07:31] it would come it should come into place
[1:07:32] in the church where the holy spirit is
[1:07:34] moving and god would move it upon one to
[1:07:36] call the other one say
[1:07:38] don't go that way that you're going go
[1:07:39] this way because i'm come because god is
[1:07:41] already aware of it
[1:07:43] does he still do those things is he
[1:07:45] still the same yesterday today and
[1:07:46] forever
[1:07:47] and he says you know so it'll keep you
[1:07:49] even from the things that you're not
[1:07:51] aware of
[1:07:53] nor for oh wait a minute
[1:07:56] a thousand shall fall at thy side and
[1:07:59] ten thousand at thy right side
[1:08:01] right hand but it shall not come nigh
[1:08:04] thee
[1:08:07] that's a promise of god so why should i
[1:08:09] fear
[1:08:10] if he said that and then he says only
[1:08:13] with thine eyes
[1:08:14] shalt out behold and see the reward of
[1:08:17] the wicked
[1:08:18] now this is david saying and and
[1:08:20] sometimes
[1:08:21] i i when i read the psalms and david is
[1:08:24] lord i
[1:08:24] do this to the wicked and lord do this
[1:08:27] and and i i
[1:08:28] i don't know i i sometimes i have to
[1:08:31] heart david
[1:08:33] why did you have such an attitude about
[1:08:34] some of the people but you know
[1:08:38] i would i would do it this way as best i
[1:08:40] could lord have mercy on them
[1:08:42] as you've had mercy on me so don't let
[1:08:46] it get into my heart that i want you to
[1:08:48] do something to him
[1:08:49] but he said he would let him handle it
[1:08:53] let him take care of it he says
[1:08:57] because thou has made the lord which is
[1:09:00] my refuge
[1:09:01] even the most time thy habitation
[1:09:06] you said because you have said i am in
[1:09:09] the hands of the lord
[1:09:10] the most high is my safe resting place
[1:09:16] you know uh when you find a place that
[1:09:19] that you can
[1:09:21] um should i say hide
[1:09:25] maybe a quiet place in the house in the
[1:09:27] room somewhere
[1:09:28] um i know when i was out driving
[1:09:31] especially
[1:09:32] uh when we were doing stuff up in the
[1:09:34] foothills there were some quiet places
[1:09:36] that you could park under a tree nobody
[1:09:37] out there
[1:09:38] and eat your lunch and be quiet you know
[1:09:41] and and it was just a
[1:09:42] like you felt like a safe place get away
[1:09:44] from all the commotion for
[1:09:45] he says in him in christ
[1:09:49] in his word is that place
[1:09:54] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:09:57] shall any plague come nigh
[1:09:58] thy dwelling remember what he told them
[1:10:01] strike the blood
[1:10:02] at the lentil at the post and that death
[1:10:05] angel going by
[1:10:06] will not enter in there he never said
[1:10:09] make yourself holy pray all night
[1:10:11] fast all night meet these needs he said
[1:10:13] take that blood
[1:10:15] from the innocent lamb and put it on the
[1:10:17] door
[1:10:18] he said in that so that tells us
[1:10:21] who is our safety and what is our safety
[1:10:24] place
[1:10:25] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:10:28] thee
[1:10:28] to keep thee in all thy ways
[1:10:32] and and when i was reading this i got
[1:10:34] the daily strength
[1:10:35] that they brought and there was a
[1:10:36] portion that i took out of there
[1:10:39] he says you may look around yourself and
[1:10:41] wonder how god
[1:10:43] could encamp angels around about you but
[1:10:46] they are there
[1:10:48] and you must believe that you must trust
[1:10:49] in that god you said so
[1:10:51] so therefore they are there the
[1:10:54] scripture promises you
[1:10:55] the angel of the lord encampeth around
[1:10:57] them that fear him
[1:10:58] and he delivereth them from psalms 34 7.
[1:11:01] there's one thing you must hold on to
[1:11:03] though you may not
[1:11:05] feel like he is there christ is always
[1:11:07] with you
[1:11:08] even the devil knew this when he tempted
[1:11:11] jesus
[1:11:12] and if he knew it and believes it so
[1:11:14] should you
[1:11:15] he knew who he was dealing with well
[1:11:19] but she should stand the same way i said
[1:11:20] no god slay me yet i'll trust him
[1:11:22] you come at me like a flood but he'll
[1:11:25] raise a standard
[1:11:28] they are watching over you and your
[1:11:30] family you can
[1:11:31] avert the danger at the command of god
[1:11:35] they watch over your home and your
[1:11:37] families angels are encamped around
[1:11:39] about
[1:11:40] you to come alongside you in your time
[1:11:43] of need
[1:11:44] you we must always remember this and
[1:11:46] trust
[1:11:47] that he is near to fear the lord
[1:11:50] is to have reference reverential trust
[1:11:53] in him
[1:11:54] and keep his ways don't fear but trust
[1:11:57] that the angel of the lord are encamped
[1:11:59] around abound you
[1:12:00] and your household if he said so then he
[1:12:03] does that
[1:12:05] now we also have to watch something
[1:12:08] keeping the atmosphere
[1:12:09] where he's comfortable to be there where
[1:12:11] he wants to be there
[1:12:13] it's his desire to be there working at
[1:12:15] the atmosphere working how it is making
[1:12:17] it a place where he's welcome to be
[1:12:19] you know i've shared this with you but
[1:12:21] when my insurance agent came over to
[1:12:23] look at the house and
[1:12:24] and he walked in and he sat down and
[1:12:25] he's looking then he stops and he goes
[1:12:27] my what a peaceful spirit there is in
[1:12:29] this home
[1:12:31] sometimes we didn't notice it because
[1:12:33] we're too busy doing everything else
[1:12:35] but let somebody else come down and sit
[1:12:37] and say wow there's such a peace there
[1:12:40] what is it about you what is it about
[1:12:42] you
[1:12:43] give me some insight why do you have
[1:12:46] peace in a time like this
[1:12:48] why is there such an assurance how can
[1:12:49] you walk like that and act like that
[1:12:52] he said because god said he would be
[1:12:53] with me and never leave me and he would
[1:12:55] watch over me
[1:12:58] so we had that the one more quote from
[1:13:00] jehovah jiren i want to read that one
[1:13:01] right now
[1:13:02] if you would put that up there
[1:13:08] many times and every time i like that
[1:13:10] many times
[1:13:11] and every time that a man ever done
[1:13:14] anything that's worth
[1:13:15] anything he walked alone with god
[1:13:18] it's not in the company of everybody
[1:13:20] else in your force and
[1:13:22] it's you and god because
[1:13:25] it if it was in the company of everybody
[1:13:27] else which company would it be
[1:13:30] but we think we have to have some great
[1:13:32] something around us to secure us
[1:13:35] the believer has that company of angels
[1:13:37] the holy spirit accompanied
[1:13:39] about the angels are encamped they don't
[1:13:42] move
[1:13:42] they stay right with them those who fear
[1:13:45] the lord
[1:13:46] they watch for every move
[1:13:49] now one time a prophet was down at
[1:13:51] dolphin elisha and the syrians had come
[1:13:53] in
[1:13:54] compassed the whole walls around and
[1:13:56] when gehazi got up and
[1:13:58] looked out he said oh look at the
[1:14:00] syrians
[1:14:01] look at all the problems look at all the
[1:14:03] things come in the bills are due
[1:14:05] this is this is going on and
[1:14:09] elijah then turns around or elisha the
[1:14:11] old prophet rubbed his eyes and looked
[1:14:12] around and said why there
[1:14:14] is more with us than there is with them
[1:14:17] hey yo gehasi looked around and said i
[1:14:20] don't see nothing
[1:14:22] maybe many of you didn't last night but
[1:14:25] that old color lady did
[1:14:26] i don't i don't know what it is i don't
[1:14:28] near that part but she saw something
[1:14:30] he says lord open this boy's eyes and
[1:14:33] when
[1:14:34] god opened his eyes all around the old
[1:14:36] prophet was angels of fire
[1:14:38] and the mountains was on fire and
[1:14:39] chariots of fire and he's jesus christ
[1:14:42] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:14:44] he's still the same
[1:14:46] so the angels are about you why should
[1:14:48] you fear
[1:14:50] now let's just talk about a situation
[1:14:54] there
[1:14:55] the angels are about you remember that
[1:14:57] watch what you're doing
[1:14:59] pay attention to what you're looking at
[1:15:01] pay attention to your
[1:15:02] language you're speaking you know
[1:15:05] say hey lord i don't want to be
[1:15:07] offensive i do not want to offend these
[1:15:09] angels
[1:15:10] i don't want them to be ashamed lord i
[1:15:13] want to please you
[1:15:14] you know and sometimes uh some of the
[1:15:17] things that i saw something the other
[1:15:19] day in the news
[1:15:20] where the the young girl was saying some
[1:15:23] words she shouldn't said so the mother
[1:15:25] mother washed her mouth out with soap so
[1:15:29] the girl said i swallowed the soap and
[1:15:31] it took cost my mom and dad five
[1:15:33] thousand dollars hospital bill to get me
[1:15:35] fixed haha on them
[1:15:38] what an attitude would you dare do that
[1:15:41] to god
[1:15:43] if we're not careful with our attitude
[1:15:45] around him we can be offensive
[1:15:48] he said i won't leave you but let's make
[1:15:50] him welcome around us let's have an
[1:15:52] atmosphere about
[1:15:53] an atmosphere that that would be
[1:15:55] pleasing to him and you know how we
[1:15:57] really show that
[1:15:59] is how we treat one another how we act
[1:16:00] around one another
[1:16:02] how we we treat our neighbors that's how
[1:16:04] it's manifest
[1:16:06] not our words we say but our actions so
[1:16:09] brother branham says he opened his eyes
[1:16:11] says man
[1:16:12] they're all around us they've always
[1:16:16] been there so
[1:16:18] now let's let's just look at at this
[1:16:21] time
[1:16:22] the bible says men's hearts would be
[1:16:24] failing for fear
[1:16:26] and and especially in our time right now
[1:16:28] the things that
[1:16:29] change even today from one way
[1:16:32] direction to another but i remind you
[1:16:35] this is satan's eden
[1:16:38] he's the god of this evil age so in that
[1:16:41] sense it shouldn't surprise you
[1:16:44] but you know he's never won a battle
[1:16:46] against god
[1:16:48] he's lost every single one when he
[1:16:50] thought he had fooled
[1:16:52] god and got to eve before god had
[1:16:54] already provided a lamb
[1:16:58] every time satan went to do something he
[1:17:00] god was there
[1:17:02] already already made a provision because
[1:17:05] men's hearts are failing for fear he
[1:17:08] says
[1:17:08] and he tells us when you see these
[1:17:11] things become to
[1:17:12] come to pass look up and lift up your
[1:17:15] heads for your redemption draweth now
[1:17:19] it's closer now than it's ever been
[1:17:21] because more and more is being fulfilled
[1:17:24] driving down the road and you're headed
[1:17:26] let's say you're going to el paso texas
[1:17:27] and you get out of
[1:17:28] the end of tucson here and it's about
[1:17:30] 300 miles the sign says
[1:17:32] but as you start going the next sign
[1:17:34] says el paso 269 miles
[1:17:37] but eventually you get to the sign that
[1:17:38] says apostles just around the next turn
[1:17:40] right
[1:17:41] well that's the way we are in today
[1:17:44] we're at the point where
[1:17:45] just around the corner we're just about
[1:17:47] there
[1:17:48] the signs of the times are there he's
[1:17:50] you know he says
[1:17:52] and you gotta you gotta be be careful
[1:17:54] because fear
[1:17:56] fear will paralyze you it'll also drive
[1:17:58] you to do works
[1:18:01] fear will get in you and you'll begin to
[1:18:03] say i've got to do this
[1:18:04] i've got to do this i've got to come to
[1:18:07] that i've got to
[1:18:08] that's the only way i can get to where
[1:18:09] god wants me
[1:18:12] and that is fear driven and i ask this
[1:18:15] question
[1:18:17] it it it'll drive a person to works and
[1:18:21] away from faith
[1:18:22] and how and when can you fulfill all the
[1:18:25] law
[1:18:28] when is enough of the law fulfilled to
[1:18:29] say that's sufficient
[1:18:34] you realize that you cannot fulfill all
[1:18:37] the law
[1:18:38] and as i was thinking about this the
[1:18:40] scripture
[1:18:41] that came to me says when they asked
[1:18:44] jesus
[1:18:44] what are the greatest commandments so
[1:18:47] let's go to galatians chapter five
[1:18:50] and we'll re read verses one through six
[1:18:52] and then 13-14
[1:18:56] and he says stand fast therefore in the
[1:18:58] liberty
[1:19:00] which christ has made us free now paul
[1:19:02] is dealing with something here
[1:19:04] the circumcision the uncircumcised do we
[1:19:08] need the law
[1:19:09] he's dealing with this amongst the the
[1:19:10] gentiles and and the jewish people then
[1:19:12] in the beginning because they had just
[1:19:14] come out from under the law
[1:19:17] you know i remember when the message
[1:19:18] first came as a young man and and we
[1:19:21] were living in california we had a lot
[1:19:23] of questions
[1:19:25] because things were changing things were
[1:19:27] different
[1:19:28] what do you mean speaking in tongues is
[1:19:30] not the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:19:32] that's what i've been raised up
[1:19:33] that's what i've been looking to do was
[1:19:34] speak in tongues because then i would
[1:19:36] have the holy ghost
[1:19:38] and suddenly things changed what do you
[1:19:41] mean that
[1:19:42] baptizing in the name of the father son
[1:19:44] and holy ghost for some was wrong
[1:19:46] because it's what they were raised up
[1:19:48] and paul is now dealing with them things
[1:19:50] they had been raised with he says
[1:19:53] he says and be not entangled again with
[1:19:56] the yoke of bondage he called that
[1:19:58] law a yoke of bondage it you had to do
[1:20:01] it this way you had to do it this way he
[1:20:03] said
[1:20:04] behold i paul said too that if ye be
[1:20:07] circumcised
[1:20:09] christ prophet you nothing if you can
[1:20:11] keep all the law then you don't need
[1:20:13] christ
[1:20:14] you don't need the shed blood you don't
[1:20:16] need the work he did because you're able
[1:20:18] to keep the law
[1:20:19] you've perfected yourself he says
[1:20:22] for i testify again to every man that is
[1:20:25] circumcised
[1:20:26] that he is a debtor to the whole law
[1:20:29] all of it from the beginning to the end
[1:20:32] who can keep it let me just see if you
[1:20:37] would raise your hand say today i never
[1:20:38] had an evil thought i never had a wrong
[1:20:40] intention
[1:20:41] i didn't get upset anybody no i got to
[1:20:44] put my hand down too
[1:20:46] you're a debtor to the whole law he says
[1:20:51] christ has become of no effect unto you
[1:20:53] whosoever of you are justified by the
[1:20:56] law
[1:20:56] ye are fallen from grace
[1:21:00] that's some hard words but it's true i
[1:21:03] read
[1:21:04] i've read every message i've heard every
[1:21:06] message of brother brandon preach in
[1:21:08] fact i've heard it
[1:21:09] five times over and
[1:21:13] or if you're doing that for works crisis
[1:21:15] is of no effect to you
[1:21:17] but if you're doing it because you love
[1:21:19] them that's a whole different reason
[1:21:21] it's a whole different way he says for
[1:21:24] we through the spirit wait for the hope
[1:21:26] of righteousness by faith
[1:21:28] lord i will stand on your word for what
[1:21:31] you said
[1:21:31] you had said if i asked for forgiveness
[1:21:34] you would forgive me
[1:21:35] you said if i would confess you would
[1:21:37] cleanse it and do away with it
[1:21:38] you said if i and god does that's a
[1:21:41] faith
[1:21:42] that you stand on god said so therefore
[1:21:44] i believe it take him at it
[1:21:46] he said for in jesus christ neither
[1:21:48] circumcision availeth anything
[1:21:50] nor uncircumcision but faith
[1:21:54] which worketh by love
[1:21:57] now if you want to see how love works
[1:21:59] just see what jesus christ did for you
[1:22:01] because he loved you he gave his all
[1:22:05] and love turns around and works right
[1:22:08] back to him the same way
[1:22:10] lord i surrender i give my all to you
[1:22:14] and then we'll read 13 and 14.
[1:22:18] for brethren you have been called unto
[1:22:20] liberty you've been set free from works
[1:22:23] trying to earn your own salvation only
[1:22:26] use not liberty for an occasion to the
[1:22:28] flesh
[1:22:29] but by love serve one another now when
[1:22:32] you realize what god has became watch
[1:22:34] what motivated him to do what he did
[1:22:36] everything that he did was motivated by
[1:22:38] love
[1:22:40] we had a a family here who had been
[1:22:44] raising the message and all and they'd
[1:22:46] left and gone
[1:22:47] elsewhere and stuff and they came back
[1:22:49] to the church here one time and
[1:22:52] they came in and i'm looking i'm going
[1:22:53] wow they've changed quite a bit
[1:22:56] the kids are in shorts and cut hair and
[1:22:59] earrings and
[1:23:01] and and different things and they told
[1:23:04] us
[1:23:04] to our face that we were serving
[1:23:09] the message by law therefore that's why
[1:23:12] our sisters dressed like they didn't do
[1:23:13] that he goes but we're so free in christ
[1:23:17] he said
[1:23:17] we're just so free we can do anything
[1:23:21] and i'm we went out and brother jerry
[1:23:25] mcfen was
[1:23:26] was here peter was just a little boy
[1:23:27] then but
[1:23:29] brother jerry got him and basically ran
[1:23:31] him right out the church
[1:23:33] get over to the am pm over there to get
[1:23:35] something to drink on the way home and
[1:23:36] he's in there and i said oh no
[1:23:38] do i wait till he leaves or do i go in
[1:23:40] there now i said i'll go in
[1:23:41] and as soon as i walked in he began to
[1:23:43] tell me things and i said brother
[1:23:45] wait to where i said you're causing a
[1:23:46] commotion here so we stepped outside and
[1:23:49] he said something to me and i looked at
[1:23:50] him and i just said here's my answer to
[1:23:52] you
[1:23:52] there was a time that people would look
[1:23:54] at you or your family said
[1:23:56] there's christians but they look at you
[1:23:59] and your family right now and you look
[1:24:00] no different than them they would never
[1:24:02] suspect you're a christian
[1:24:05] and about that time i said he's going to
[1:24:07] hit me
[1:24:08] because his hand went back like this so
[1:24:11] i did the best thing my dad said run so
[1:24:13] i did
[1:24:14] i always say that my mom told me if they
[1:24:16] look older than the second greater
[1:24:18] don't fight when they might beat you up
[1:24:20] but you know i just took off
[1:24:22] there was no reason to do that but he
[1:24:24] says look
[1:24:26] do not use it for the occasion to the
[1:24:28] flesh i'm free i can do anything i
[1:24:30] please no
[1:24:31] he said be bound and constrained by the
[1:24:33] love of god in your life he said
[1:24:35] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[1:24:38] even
[1:24:38] in this thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:24:41] thyself
[1:24:43] and it made me go back who better
[1:24:45] express
[1:24:46] that than him when he looked at us
[1:24:50] fallen broken a mess and he said
[1:24:53] i'm going to go down and redeem them i'm
[1:24:55] going to go down and save them i'm going
[1:24:57] to take their place you know what he
[1:24:58] became he became your kinsmen redeemer
[1:25:02] he began to look and this this made me i
[1:25:04] was reading through the message
[1:25:06] um on the breach and it got to that
[1:25:08] portion where
[1:25:09] where john is it is there and and
[1:25:12] and he says he realizes no one is worthy
[1:25:15] found worthy to open the book and john
[1:25:19] realizes if the book is not
[1:25:20] open and the names are revealed there is
[1:25:23] no redemption
[1:25:25] and brother branham really begins to
[1:25:27] describe it in that portion where he
[1:25:28] says he begins to look around john
[1:25:30] begins to look around and there's
[1:25:31] there's elijah and he's be calling out
[1:25:34] these prophets he goes
[1:25:35] not a single one of them is worthy but
[1:25:38] the law
[1:25:38] required a kinsmen redeemer it could not
[1:25:41] be an angel
[1:25:43] it could not be one that was not born
[1:25:45] with flesh
[1:25:46] it had to be a kinsmen redeemer and you
[1:25:49] know who became your kinsman redeemer
[1:25:52] he took flesh upon himself he was born
[1:25:55] like a baby
[1:25:56] a human baby was born and it says he
[1:25:58] learned
[1:25:59] through obedience by the things he
[1:26:01] suffered he can be touched by the
[1:26:03] feeling of our infirmities
[1:26:04] and he became your kinsmen redeemer
[1:26:07] brother branham is speaking there and he
[1:26:08] begins to say oh
[1:26:10] grace amazing grace how sweet the sound
[1:26:14] has saved a wretch like me you know
[1:26:17] so so here he is we're looking and john
[1:26:20] is crying out and he's saying nobody's
[1:26:21] found
[1:26:22] worthy and and he says who
[1:26:25] nobody the angels couldn't do it they
[1:26:27] were not kinsmen
[1:26:29] you know gabriel couldn't do it it was
[1:26:30] not a kinsmen redeemer
[1:26:32] but this and then he hears that voice
[1:26:34] weep not john
[1:26:35] don't cry don't give up and despair
[1:26:37] don't throw your hands up don't walk
[1:26:39] away from this john
[1:26:40] for the lion of the tribe of judah has
[1:26:42] prevailed
[1:26:44] so what does john do he turns around to
[1:26:46] look for a lion
[1:26:49] if i said hey sister shirley there's a
[1:26:52] ferocious lamb coming after you
[1:26:55] probably wouldn't catch your attention
[1:26:57] but if i said hey there's a lion coming
[1:27:00] you would turn to look and see because
[1:27:01] there's something that a lion commands
[1:27:03] so john is turning to see this
[1:27:05] prevailing line and his mind there's a
[1:27:08] brother branham describes it this way
[1:27:11] i'm just kind of paraphrasing the things
[1:27:13] he said
[1:27:14] but he turns around and sees a bloody
[1:27:16] lamb
[1:27:17] one who had been slain john had not seen
[1:27:20] him yet
[1:27:21] he said where did he come he had come
[1:27:23] down from eternity he said where he had
[1:27:25] been
[1:27:25] up there that that bloody lamb so he
[1:27:28] said he was
[1:27:29] he was mediating for us his blood was
[1:27:31] covering for us
[1:27:33] and john then begins to rejoice because
[1:27:35] he realizes
[1:27:37] redemption was going to take his place
[1:27:40] because god had provided a lamb
[1:27:43] so why fear again that's my question why
[1:27:47] fear
[1:27:48] why be afraid god said so and he's kept
[1:27:51] it
[1:27:51] he's kept his word so
[1:27:55] again i would say
[1:27:59] if i could let's go to psalms
[1:28:02] 23. you've probably never heard this
[1:28:05] psalms before it'll be the first time
[1:28:07] you hear it but
[1:28:08] you got to hear it it's good it's real
[1:28:10] good
[1:28:12] david says it this way the lord is my
[1:28:15] shepherd
[1:28:17] now sometimes we think a shepherd as an
[1:28:19] owner we might think a shepherd as the
[1:28:21] boss
[1:28:23] but no the shepherd is a caretaker he's
[1:28:25] the one that watches over the lamb he's
[1:28:27] the one that makes sure they're going to
[1:28:28] be fed he's the one that takes
[1:28:30] he might have to break the leg of one
[1:28:32] because that lamb is not behaving but
[1:28:34] you know why
[1:28:35] so he can carry it up close he said the
[1:28:38] lord is my shepherd
[1:28:40] i shall not one it says the lord takes
[1:28:43] care of me as
[1:28:44] his sheep i will not be without
[1:28:47] any good thing all that god does is good
[1:28:52] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:28:54] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[1:28:57] waters
[1:28:58] i lay down in rest with no fear because
[1:29:02] he leads me away from danger
[1:29:06] you can rest when your assurance and
[1:29:09] your rest
[1:29:10] is in christ you see god he's proven it
[1:29:12] over and over
[1:29:14] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[1:29:17] paths of righteousness
[1:29:19] for his name's sake
[1:29:22] he bringeth it back from its errors in
[1:29:25] wandering because at times we have been
[1:29:27] places and done things we say lord how
[1:29:29] did i get here
[1:29:31] maybe just me then i don't know not
[1:29:34] for any worth in me but for the glory of
[1:29:37] his
[1:29:38] justice and faithfulness and his
[1:29:40] goodness
[1:29:41] for his name's sake have you ever heard
[1:29:44] that
[1:29:44] because i want to keep my good name i'm
[1:29:48] going to pay your bill
[1:29:50] because um they co-signed for you
[1:29:54] and you faulted on the debt and they
[1:29:58] want to keep their good name
[1:29:59] so they pay off the debt that's what
[1:30:02] he's saying right here for his name's
[1:30:03] sake
[1:30:04] he paid a debt he did not owe
[1:30:08] i owed a debt i couldn't pay
[1:30:11] so here he is for his name's sake
[1:30:15] he says
[1:30:19] what verse were we on there for yea
[1:30:22] though i walk
[1:30:24] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:30:26] death
[1:30:28] and that says this is kind of where the
[1:30:30] point goes i will fear no evil
[1:30:33] for thou art with me thy rod
[1:30:36] and thy staff they comfort me when i
[1:30:39] have to go
[1:30:40] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:30:42] death there are times
[1:30:45] that we get news you go to the doctor
[1:30:49] you get a test you have some pain you
[1:30:51] have something
[1:30:52] and you go see and the doctor says well
[1:30:53] we find this and you
[1:30:55] and you're walking maybe maybe it's very
[1:30:58] serious
[1:30:59] not just something that you can quickly
[1:31:01] recover a little bit of
[1:31:02] of exercise maybe the doctor will say
[1:31:04] get up and walk around a little bit oh
[1:31:06] that's that's not that hard
[1:31:07] but he said we find cancer in your body
[1:31:11] and you're walking through the the
[1:31:13] valley of the shadow of death
[1:31:15] you will fear no evil for thou art with
[1:31:18] me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:31:21] the wrong and the staff their shows but
[1:31:23] sometimes they say it's the same thing
[1:31:24] it can be used to to kind of support
[1:31:27] yourself
[1:31:28] it can also be used to reach over and
[1:31:29] get some attention
[1:31:32] it depends what you were doing with it
[1:31:33] and he does the same thing sometimes
[1:31:35] he's walking with you and
[1:31:36] he might be if i could put it this way
[1:31:37] he's a shepherd and he's just using the
[1:31:39] rod but sometimes he's reaching over and
[1:31:41] getting your attention
[1:31:44] because he loves you thou preparest a
[1:31:47] table before me in the presence of mine
[1:31:49] enemies
[1:31:51] okay we have enemies it's not your
[1:31:54] brother's not your sister
[1:31:56] brother braham said it over it's the
[1:31:57] devil
[1:31:59] and though he comes like a flood god has
[1:32:01] raised up a standard
[1:32:03] a lot of times we want to put the devil
[1:32:05] in a person
[1:32:07] and we want to do the other way we want
[1:32:09] to put god in that person
[1:32:11] but it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:32:15] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:32:18] runeth over
[1:32:19] he says
[1:32:23] you have made provisions
[1:32:27] every needs applied in openness
[1:32:32] before all that opposed me
[1:32:35] god doesn't do it in secret god meets
[1:32:38] your need out
[1:32:40] people know god has met your need and
[1:32:42] you can testify of it too
[1:32:44] i thought you were dying of cancer no
[1:32:47] god has healed me
[1:32:48] he's met my need how did you god met my
[1:32:51] deed
[1:32:52] in openness he doesn't do it behind god
[1:32:55] is a god who
[1:32:56] if i could say he has pride in his own
[1:32:59] work because he's faithful
[1:33:01] he's not afraid i mean he has said that
[1:33:03] in the scripture there is no other god
[1:33:04] before me there is none like me
[1:33:07] because it's true he's the only one that
[1:33:09] can say that
[1:33:13] and he says surely goodness and mercy
[1:33:17] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:33:21] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:33:24] lord
[1:33:25] forever and let me just say something
[1:33:28] the lord dwells in you
[1:33:31] this is your house sometimes we put it
[1:33:35] in a building sometimes we put it in a
[1:33:37] certain church or a certain location but
[1:33:39] no
[1:33:39] you are the temple no you not you are
[1:33:42] the temple of the holy ghost
[1:33:44] he says truly
[1:33:48] blessings and mercy will be with me all
[1:33:50] the days of my life
[1:33:52] and i will have a place in the house of
[1:33:54] the lord all of my days
[1:33:58] amen i surrender all
[1:34:01] i yield to you lord here i am but you
[1:34:04] know what even more than you desire
[1:34:06] he desires it more brother branham
[1:34:08] talked about that and he says
[1:34:10] you want the holy ghost and god wants to
[1:34:12] give it more than you want
[1:34:14] because he knows it's what you need he
[1:34:16] knows it's that seal
[1:34:18] he knows it's the guaranteed uh as
[1:34:21] brother brahm talked about the freight
[1:34:22] inspector he would look through and see
[1:34:23] how it was packed for the train
[1:34:25] and he'd make sure it was packed
[1:34:27] perfectly so it's going to arrive to its
[1:34:29] destination then he would put a seal on
[1:34:31] it
[1:34:32] and brother brown would say quite often
[1:34:34] dare any man try to mess with it
[1:34:37] that's a promise of god so why should i
[1:34:39] fear
[1:34:42] i take god at his word and say lord your
[1:34:44] word says so
[1:34:47] brother branham says tell him go say god
[1:34:50] he loves to be reminded of his word he's
[1:34:52] faithful
[1:34:53] you know the girls would do it but dad
[1:34:55] you said so
[1:34:57] and sometimes dad just said it to when
[1:34:59] they were little to
[1:35:01] fight him up a bit tomorrow tomorrow
[1:35:04] knowing that tomorrow wasn't coming but
[1:35:06] god's not that way at all
[1:35:08] god keeps his word
[1:35:12] and you might be in this portion right
[1:35:14] now but god has seen you here already
[1:35:18] he says you're mine and i'll never let
[1:35:20] you go
[1:35:22] he's jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:35:24] today and forever
[1:35:27] there's probably i could have probably
[1:35:29] had another 20 pages of notes but
[1:35:31] not for tonight so the musicians would
[1:35:34] make their way
[1:35:35] why should i fear god is faithful
[1:35:40] and that and again i'll say fear comes
[1:35:44] every one of us fear will come it'll
[1:35:47] it'll come at you like a flood
[1:35:48] but say god you've right up raised up a
[1:35:51] standard
[1:35:53] you know you you could you can even sing
[1:35:56] a song the joy of the lord is my
[1:35:57] strength
[1:36:00] because sometimes we get all caught up
[1:36:01] in the emotions of the and the the
[1:36:03] the hard part of this and we forget that
[1:36:06] singing praises to god
[1:36:07] singing worship to god talking about his
[1:36:10] goodness changes the whole atmosphere
[1:36:11] about us
[1:36:13] sheltered safe in the arms of god
[1:36:17] have you ever done that when you're
[1:36:18] feeling down just begin to worship and
[1:36:20] praise him
[1:36:21] it works how many would testify that it
[1:36:23] works
[1:36:24] all sudden the attitude the mood
[1:36:26] everything changes and hey i can get up
[1:36:28] and go again
[1:36:30] that's why we're here for one another
[1:36:32] too
[1:36:33] all part of the body of god you know
[1:36:36] in the the sickness that i went through
[1:36:38] when i when i had the
[1:36:40] the toe um and i lost a toe there and
[1:36:43] it's not lost
[1:36:44] it's the same place the hairs are it's
[1:36:46] coming back
[1:36:47] and i know i've said this to me and i
[1:36:49] think i told my wife i said one of these
[1:36:50] days i'm going to show you this toe back
[1:36:52] on this foot
[1:36:53] and we'll know the resurrection has
[1:36:54] drawn nigh because god said you're going
[1:36:57] to go back whole
[1:36:59] but you know that she told me that she
[1:37:02] said
[1:37:02] there's about 6 000 things going on in
[1:37:05] your
[1:37:06] body at all times communication sounds
[1:37:09] everything
[1:37:10] that you don't know about until one of
[1:37:13] them goes wrong
[1:37:15] and then oh oh what's going on
[1:37:18] love one another encourage one another
[1:37:21] pray for one another
[1:37:22] stand with one another sing songs
[1:37:25] say hey lord lord i'm gonna worship you
[1:37:27] i'm gonna praise you in this situation
[1:37:29] paul and silas sitting there they're
[1:37:31] they're down in the dungeon and brother
[1:37:33] lyle brought that
[1:37:35] that macedonia call but they're down in
[1:37:37] the dungeon i've always said
[1:37:39] silas is sitting there and thinking paul
[1:37:42] you never told me about this part
[1:37:45] i've heard about the wonderful things
[1:37:47] god has done and all these wonderful
[1:37:49] things in you
[1:37:51] but you didn't tell us paul says there's
[1:37:54] an answer to this silas
[1:37:55] let's just begin to sing praises ain't
[1:37:58] god good he gives us so many blessings
[1:38:00] and silas is going like oh that's a
[1:38:02] tough one to sing in this situation but
[1:38:04] okay
[1:38:05] and he began to worship and god comes
[1:38:08] on the scene every time
[1:38:11] so why should i fear there is no fear in
[1:38:14] perfect love
[1:38:16] and he has given us perfect love and the
[1:38:19] power of a sound mind so
[1:38:21] let's bow our heads
[1:38:24] lord we you're that great kinsman
[1:38:28] redeemer lord
[1:38:29] amazing grace how sweet the sound it

[1:38:37] could ever be i was still lost
[1:38:39] and unsavable nothing good that have i
[1:38:43] done as they sang the song he knew me
[1:38:46] yet he loved me knowing that this
[1:38:50] looking at this vile body and everything
[1:38:52] that it goes through and all
[1:38:54] you still loved us lord because
