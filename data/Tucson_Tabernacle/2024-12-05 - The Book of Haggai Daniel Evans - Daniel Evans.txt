stepped out for a minute uh it's it's good it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord um I uh today I can Mark there's many special days in my life that I've had I remember my 21st birthday is when I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus I um remember the day that I was driving home from work late at night and the whole holy spirit filled my my car and I made a commitment to him remember when the lord gave me my commission to preach the gospel but I don't know of a greater day in my life than uh than today this December the 4th this is the day that my wife was born today she is 39 years old no you're 50 right sweetie no she's somewhere between those more towards the middle than towards the edges it's uh today's my today Stephanie's birthday and and uh as I said it's this is the day that the Lord brought my my mate into this world I'm grateful grateful to have um we've had a a we've been married 26 years and yeah we just celebrated 26 years a couple weeks ago and um it's been it's been all been good I'm thankful for her patience um my uh my cousin um she uh she passed away a little while ago um about a week ago or so and uh she had a she had a hard life she um we're going to bury her tomorrow and uh she got strung out on drugs and um she it was just a ever since she was a young girl she had a weakness and uh the family is getting together tomorrow um to pay pay our last respects and and to and barrier but I I want to tell you how important it is the work that we're doing here at the on Tabernacle that we uh David good to see you I acknowledged it before but it's it's good good to have you in service um that we give a place for people to come in and to have some stability in their lives and to have some love when they when they come in no matter who it is we always want to greet them with the right hand of Fellowship we always want to show people love because you never know who you're talking to you you never know what they're going through what they need and most of the time almost all the time it's not really what the pastor says from the pulpit what it usually is is the love that was presented to these these visitors that we might have and I look at my cousin and I just wish that she would have stumbled into a church one day that would have given her love and and taking taking her under their wing and um just showed her here's what Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ loves you the disciples were rough characters most of them and that's what we're here for we Jesus said I am not sent to the ones that don't need a doctor he says I am sent to the sick ones I am sent to the ones that need help and I believe that's that's our church and let's always let's never forget that and I think that I am so proud of what we do at the Tucson Tabernacle that we do have that Ministry and I wanted to get greater and and just going through this we weren't close I haven't talked to my cousin in 20 years but seeing that wow if she would have just had a place that she could have gone to that she felt comfortable just one person if it could have been just it could sister Debbie could be just somebody like you that you just read out a reach out a loving hand to one of these young ladies that that might come in one day or or one of the you know with Daniel or or with Brother John or whoever it is that if someone comes in show them love and and be willing to to go the extra mile for him Jude I believe was said that you're willing to reach down into the fire for somebody and pull them out of the fire and I just want to see us continue on this path and never look back always always represent Jesus Christ that savior wherever you go and we might be the only Jesus Christ that someone ever sees because we represent him the disciples When Jesus ascended the disciples repr represented Jesus Christ and we need to be that Jesus Christ to whoever and as I said you never know you never know the influence that you'll have on someone's life and if you reach out that hand you might very well be the person that they reach out to when they finally make their decision that I want to change my life so just be ready always always be ready um we're going to get to the book of haggi it's uh we're back down to the last three books in the Old Testament um book of Hagi is from here on these are the prophets that prophesied after the Captivity I'm amazed how much happened right before and during this captivity of Jerusalem we see Isaiah starts prophesying here and then and then the Captivity immediately followed Jeremiah prophesies Ezekiel prophesies all the way down through um many of these prophets all during this time so to give a little um history of the Exile so what happened was um Israel as was typical fell into sin God would send prophets and warn them Israel would repent and they fall into sin finally God sent this mighty king named Nebuchadnezzar the most powerful man in the world to come in and lay Siege to Jerusalem so Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon comes in they surround the city and and the they first attack in and it's hard to find an exact date but it's around 605 that the Babylonians first come in and they lay a 20year Siege on Jerusalem and things were really rough they they start taking captives Daniel the Prophet Daniel was one of the first captives that they took they brought him and many of his um counterparts many of the Jews they took them to Babylon and they stayed there and then that's around 605 and then about 587 they fully captured Jerusalem and they destroyed the temple we've been going through these Bible studies most of you have been here this Temple was a center to their worship Nebuchadnezzar comes in he destroys it tens of thousands of Jews were deported at this time and when they brought the Jews into Babylon that started the time ticking for the prophecy of Jeremiah that they would be in Exile in a Strange Land for 70 years in captivity the time started ticking we know that Daniel prophesied during this Exile and he he um knew from the writings of Jeremiah that um they would be there for this 70 years and then Nebuchadnezzar takes the captives and destroys the temple then comes in an alliance and Allied Forces between the mes and the Persians they attack Nebuchadnezzar's son was the king at that time and they attack they destroy the Babylonians and they take control and that was this king of the mes named dasas then time goes on and uh this King named Cyrus who is a king of the Persians he releases the Jews through this man named zerubabel and zerubabel wants to bring his people back to their homeland of Jerusalem in five about 535 536 they they come out and they lay the foundations of the new Temple temp Le that was destroyed it's been 70 years since it was prophesied or since they came into captivity and now they are released and they come back and they want to rebuild this Temple and they go and they lay the foundations for the new Temple then um around 16 years later which we will get to at about 520 BC Hagi shows up and um he begins prophesying now I'm going to start with Ezra chapter 1 Ezra the first five chapters is during um hagi's prophecy so let's read um let's read e Ezra 5 chapter 5 verse one so Ezra is um Hagi is mentioned in the book of Ezra it says says this then the prophet Hagi and Zachariah which we're going to get to the son of Ido prophets prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of of in the name of the god of Israel who was over them so I'm going to be going back to this book of Ezra as we go through this book of Hagi because it's it's a very very important time so let's go to Hagi so we know that Hagi is prophesying at the same time time that Ezra is there and the people came out and um Hagi one verse one it's only two chap two chapters and so we'll read every word if time permits in the second year of daras the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by Hagi the prophet priest unto zerubabel I like the way he calls him the prophet priest the prophet priest un zerubabel the son of shelo now remember Z rubel is the one that led them out of Babylon the son of shelo governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of jedc the high the the high so Joshua is the high priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came the word of the Lord by the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye that dwell to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste what does that mean here's the whole thing behind the book of Hagi sealed houses that word doesn't exist today that's an Old English word from the King James it's it obviously exist existed a few hundred years ago but the new King James said says this in verse three then the word of the Lord came by the hand of haggi the Prophet is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your panel houses and this Temple to lie in Ruins so these panel houses these are the same panels that they were building the interior of their house with these are the same panels that were imported for Le Lebanon that were originally intended to finish the Temple of the Lord and now these people are using these Jews are using what was supposed to be for the temple they're using this to build their own houses verse four again is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your panel houses and this Temple to lie in Ruins now therefore thus sayeth the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have sown you have sown much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you are not filled with drink you you clothe you but there is none warm and he that earns wages earnthenecklace but you're still thirsty you you wear clothes but you're still cold you earn wages but it's not enough to pay the bills it's like carrying a money bag that's got holes in it everything's just dropping out I know many of us have been through that or it's like wow I just can't get ahead I earn money and then I have bills and then I earn money and then I have bills and it just like what's going on you are not prospering ha GUI saying usually and we'll go back usually in the prophetic books like Jeremiah Ezekiel Joel Jonah the prophet just rips the people and tells them all their sins and tells them to repent but Hagi is a little different he's telling them basically that you didn't finish the job and the same for the Israelites zerubabel as I said he brought them out of Babylon by a decree from the Persian king Cyrus and then they started construction on the temple but some reason it for some reason it stopped and the temple was left unfinished for 16 years and then they start taking the the parts that were supposed to go in the temple and they start building their houses out out of it what's going on there's something behind this usually would just say oh it's just because idolatry crept in or or there there was something wrong but there is something behind all this I remember when I was a kid we wanted a swimming pool man that was like that was going to be it and dad said okay well we um we'll build a swimming pool so we did all the Landscaping in the backyard we built the wall dug the big hole and put all the gunite put the concrete in all the steps and everything and the pool was was right there ready and and and then Dad stopped building the pool and we had this concrete hole in our backyard for years I remember laying in bed and hearing the frogs in the pool because it would rain in the monsoon season and the pool would get like this water in it and somehow frogs got in there and they were making all these noise and you all night and I was just like man dad finish the pool you know we we want to get done but what had happened was Dad ran out of money and he couldn't finish it and we were we were embarrassed and the neighbors would laugh at us and and I'm surprised that fish didn't involve from the pool but eventually dad got the money and and plastered the pool and got all the plumbing and finished it and we look at sometimes things don't get finished there's always a reason for it and it was 16 years that this Temple sat or the the just the foundation sat and nothing happened why we're going to find out that there's really two things at work here we're going to go to the Book of Malachi here in a couple weeks and we're going to see they that they aren't paying they weren't paying paying their ties they they weren't giving God their best sacrifices as we'll learn in Malachi they weren't being good husbands to their wives as we'll learn in the book of Mali Malachi they weren't giving their time to God as we will learn but there is another reason in Hagi why this um Temple was not being finished so let's remember I said this is during this time of Ezra so let's go back to the book of Ezra chapter 4 and let's read it now there is a new king at this time a new king it's not Babylon but it's Persia this man AR Xerxes and Cyrus was a friend of the of the um of the Jews so was dasas was a friend of the Jews but this Persian king AR of Xerxes he didn't have the background that they had he didn't know Daniel he didn't know all of these Great Men he wasn't familiar with the Jews he wasn't a aware of all the prophecies and all the good that they had done now let's let's start with verse U chapter 4 verse one I'm going to read I'm not a big fan of the NIV version of the Bible The New International Version um it's it's a bit of a summary but I'm going to read we can put the King James up there but I'm going to read the NIV because it's more of a um a summarized um take on it and it gives us the story a little bit better when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard heard that the Exiles were building a temple for the Lord the god of Israel they came to zerubabel to the heads of the families and said let us help you build because like you we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of ezer Adin the king of Assyria who brought us here but zerubabel and Joshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered they saw through this was a scheme and they saw through it they answered you have no part with us in building a temple to our God we alone will build it for the Lord the god of Israel as king Cyrus the King of Persia commanded us then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and to make them afraid to go on building they bribed officials to work against them and frustrated and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus King of Persia and down to the reign of dasas King of Persia the King James version says they hired counselors against them they hired lawyers against these people to try to get them to stop building this church let's go down to uh so the two the the two big problems here was this this guy named sand ballot and this other guy named tobah and they show up in Ezra the the chap chapter 2 and their problems for the rest of the time so they write a letter to King arz Xerxes and they presented their case and arz Xerxes gave his judgment and they brought a court order against these Jews to make them stop building so what happened let's skip to uh verse 17 in Ezra 4 the king sent this reply to ream commanding officer shimshai the secretary and the rest of their Associates living in samarra and elsewhere the trans Euphrates greetings the letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence I issued an order and a search was made and it was found that this city has a long history of Revolt speaking of Jerusalem against Kings and has been placed of rebellion and Sedition Jerusalem has had powerful Kings ruling over the whole trans Euphrates and taxes tribute and Duty were paid to them now issue an order to these men to stop work so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order be careful not to neglect this matter why let this threat go to the detriment of the royal interests as soon as the copy of the letter of King arz Xerxes was read to raham and shimshi the secretary and their associates they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and they compelled them by forc to stop thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the Reign until the year of the reign of dasas until the second year of the reign of dasas King of Persia so what they did is they sued them and then they started intimidating them and they they said that we're going to you're going to be thrown in jail or you're you're going to suffer and and then they not only did they they forced them through the law but they also troops against them so this was a hard time they might have published an article in the Arizona Daily Star trying to discourage them they might they might have they might have brought out corrupt pastors or they might have they might have shown a dominating church and they might have found many things wrong with these different different places and they brought these up and they sued them and they caused them to be discouraged and the people were discouraged so they said you know what I quit we're done we're just going to go our way and they take some of the stuff from the from from the the the um Temple and they start building their house with it houses with it and these poor people they were down they were discouraged and it says this verse number 24 again thus the work on the house of God which is at Jerusalem so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of dasas King of Persia very important so what happened in the second year of the reign of duras King of Persia that got things started again remember they were discouraged they they gave up 16 years passed it and and it when all the way to the second year of this manaras so what happened Hagi chapter 1 verse one this is awesome in the second year of dasas the king same as Ezra in the second year of dasas the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by Hagi the prophet unto zerubabel the son of shtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of jedc the high priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this people the time saying saying this people say the time is not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came the word of the Lord by Hagi the prophet saying it is time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed your panel houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have sown much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you are not filled with drink you you clothe you but there is none warm and he that earnthenecklace [Music] for you take a step back and consider your ways go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house build the temple and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified sayeth the Lord so you've slacked in your priorities hard times have come but now is more important than yesterday get up let's get moving let's let's get the job done you're down you're discouraged but here's Hagi and he's preaching saying let's go let's do this I told a story or marily Lee told me a story when um when brother Rod her her husband passed away she's down down just like maybe these people are they're down and she she went out riding her bike and she she slowed down stopped and and she fell over and she fell down and there's marily Le and she's my husband's gone every you know the the the pressure was just on her and she's sitting there and the bike's laying there and she's sitting on the ground and she says well I can just sit here and cry or I can get up and she got up and she she got back on the bike and it's the same with these people ha gu saying you can do it it you're down but get up let's get moving let's get this job done you looked for much and lo it came to little and when you when you brought it home I did blow upon it why sayeth the Lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and you run every man into his into his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from DW and the Earth is stayed from her fruit not even d falling there's this drought that's come the your your plants aren't bearing fruit and it's because you haven't built the you haven't got up you haven't resumed this you haven't built this this Temple even though sand ballot and tobia I know they were Harden you they sued you they did all of this stuff they posted in the newspaper they they came down on you but get back up I call the drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon the labor of the Sands then zerubabel the son of shelo and Joshua the son of jedc the high priest with all of the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of their of the Lord their God and the words of haggi the the prophet as the Lord their God had sent him and the people did fear before the Lord wow this is not like what they usually did they actually listened to the prophet they got up yeah they fell down off the bike but they got up they said let's get this thing done let's start building then zerubabel again the son of shelo and Joshua the son of jedc the high priest with all of the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the words of Hagi the prophet as the Lord their God had sent him and the people did fear before the Lord then spake Hagi the Lord's messenger and the Lord's the message unto the people saying I Am with You sayeth the Lord you're getting up you're moving you're you're you're Bu you're you're you're willing to do it I am with you and the Lord stirred up the spirit of zerubabel the son of Shel shtiel governor of Judah remember he's the one that brought him out and he became the leader and the spirit of Joshua the son of jzc the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people it wasn't just the leaders that got stirred up God stirred us all up and said let's do this and they got excited and they came and they did the work in the house of the Lord of host their God in the 4 and 20th day of the sixth month in the second year of dasas the king so they went back to building and they built this Temple chapter 2 in the seventh month in the one and 20th day of the month came the word of the Lord by the prophet haggi saying speak now to zerubabel the son of shelo governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of jedc the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison as of it is nothing so you old folks he's like all of you that were here that you're 80 90 100 years old you remember this Temple you remember how beautiful this was you remember how God had filled it you remember the the glory and now look at this it's not where it should be yet now be strong oh zerubabel sayeth the Lord and be strong oh Joshua son of jedc the high priest and be strong all ye people people of the land sayeth the Lord and work for I Am with You sayeth the Lord of hosts how encouraging this is he's not beating him down he's lifting them up he's saying I'm with you you're going right now work now get this done according to the to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not he's saying that I am the same God that brought you out of captivity of Egypt with 10 10 plagues upon Pharaoh I'm the same God that turned the water of the Nile River to blood I'm the same God that brought all the plagues I am the same God that when you were we the the army of Egypt was coming at you and you had the the Red Sea behind you I'm the same God that parted both both sides and you walked across dry land I am the same God that did that I am the same God that's with you now I love that part that's encouraging fear ye not for thus sayeth the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with house with Glory sayeth the Lord of hosts I love the power and the authority of God for thus sayeth the Lord yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house that they're building I will fill it with Glory sayeth the Lord Lord of hosts saying I one day may not look like much now but one day I am going to bless this house the silver is mine the Gold is mine sayith the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former the the glory of the new Temple will be greater than the glory of the old temple temple he's saying you old folks you remember how great it was he was even even greater than that when Solomon had it finished and the spirit of the Lord came in and filled it it's going to be even greater than that the glory of the latter house shall be greater than the former sayeth the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace peace sayeth the Lord of hosts now after encouraging them he gets them going he says I'm with you go build let's let's do this and here's Hagi he's prophesying he says okay it's been 16 years all right I understand that you were discouraged I understand all these things happen but guess what it's going to be better than it was in the beginning now look at it now there is coming we look back at the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts where they all spoken in unknown tongues and they went out and they did all these Miracles it's going to be greater than that it's going to be greater than that because we're going to have so much faith that we are not just going to heal the sick so much faith is going to come down that we are just going to be like Enoch and we're just going to walk up with God show me greater Faith than that in the Bible Elijah went up in a chariot of fire Enoch walked up with God that's going to happen here the day of Pentecost was wonderful but it's going to be greater and he's saying here he's saying that this new Temple that is going to be built it's going to be greater than it was before wow in the fourth and 20th day of the ninth month in the second year of daras came the word of the Lord by Hagi the prophet saying thus sayeth the Lord of hosts ask now the priest concerning the law saying okay listen so when we have a good service it's not all you're great it's not all things are going to be better it's not all what I just said that the faith is going to increase so much that we're going to be raptured that is going to happen but there is also correction that comes along with it a real believer loves correction we love to be like Lord I am falling short what is it about that repentance that feels so good when you just when something's said or a scripture's read or or or a song's read sang and you just like Lord I'm so sorry I feel so bad but it feels good when something like that happens to you and here the prophet he's going to bring some correction and now the priest concerning the law thus sayith the Lord of hosts ask now the priest concerning the law saying if one bear holy flesh in the skirt of His Garment and with his skirt touch bread or pottage or wine or oil or any meat shall it be holy and the priest answered and said no the priests knew the Book of Leviticus they know that if you touch a dead body now you're unclean and you have to you have to go through all the rituals to get clean and if you touch something that's unclean now you're unclean and if you touch somebody else then they become unclean or whatever they touch becomes unclean so they knew they knew the teachings of Moses they knew what this was and they said no that is not clean verse um verse number 13 then said Hagi if one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these shall it be unclean and the priest answered and said yeah it shall be unclean then answered Hagi and said so is this people and so is this nation before me sayeth the Lord and so is every work of their minds that and that which they offer there is unclean now he's offering this rebuke as an encouragement and he's saying that listen if you are going to live an unclean life and you're going to go build this Temple the Temple's going to be unclean if you are going to go try to preach a sermon and you're living a sinful life your sermon is going to be unclean if you're are going to try to help someone else and you are living an unclean life it is going to be a tainted blessing to that person you are going to pass on that uncleanness and he's saying now listen you all if you are unclean and you're trying to build this Temple it'll make the temple unclean so live right and now I pray now I pray you consider from this day and upward and from and from before A Stone was laid upon the stone in the temple of the Lord since those days were when one came to a heap of 20 measures there were but 10 when one came to the Press fat for to draw out 50 vessels out of the press there were but 20 I smoked you with blasting and with mildew and with hail and with and in all labors of your hands yet you turned not to me sayeth the Lord so remember what he said at the beginning he said you work and you don't have enough he said you grow crops and they don't bear he said he said you you eat but but you're still hungry you drink but you're still thirsty so consider these things verse number 18 consider now from this day and upward from the 4 and 20th day of the ninth month even from the day that the foundation of the Lord's Temple was laid consider it is the seed yet in the barn y as as yet the vine and the Fig Tree and the pomegranate and the Olive Tree hath not brought forth from this day not brought forth from this day will I bless you and again the word of the Lord came to Hagi in the 4 and 20th day of the month saying now he's going to give his last prophecy and this was one of those things that was probably a mystery to the people that he was speaking to speak to zerubabel the governor of Judah now remember zerubabel was from the from the tribe of Judah it's important here saying I will shake the heavens and the Earth and I will overflow the Throne of the king of Kingdoms and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the Heathen and I will overthrow flow the overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and their Riders shall come down Everyone by the sword of his brother in that day sayeth the Lord of hosts will I take thee Oh zerubabel my servant the son of shtiel sayeth the Lord and will make thee as a signant for I have chosen thee say saith the Lord of hosts so it seems very much like wow this is the Messiah this guy zerubabel looks like he is going to be the king he looks like he's going to be this son of David that's to come that's going to liberate Judah and to restore this Kingdom through Power and through Wars and and and to conquer so the people probably had a question in their mind I is the prophet talking about this rubel he wasn't he was talking about another lion from the tribe of Judah he was talking about another son of David that was to come but this zerubabel here is the one that brought them out and it's a beautiful type of Jesus Christ how he brings people out of sin and we exalt him the musicians can come and we'll close the book of Hagi is [Music] tremendous it's it's there it's saying that listen you have wasted time you have you have taken the the things of the Lord and you have used them for your own benefit you haven't you haven't done right you haven't and we're going to hear from The Book of Malachi in all the things that they haven't done but in Hagi he's saying but it's okay from now on do it and let's build this Temple and let's get this work done tremendous tremendously encouraging book two chapters action packed brother Josiah do you have a song for us [Music] I want to live the way he wants me to live I want you give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more for I could never never out love the Lord I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I
