[34:29] brother he said I want to quit
[34:32] smoking and I want to get the Holy
[34:35] Ghost and brought him up there to
[34:38] baptize him and brother Silas said a few
[34:42] days ago um as you know I sent out the
[34:45] prayer request for him he went into the
[34:47] hospital to be prayed to be um because
[34:49] he had low oxygen levels and he had a
[34:51] really bad case of the
[34:53] flu what I didn't know is brother Silas
[34:56] um as started to get sick he looked and
[35:01] there on his counter was a carton of
[35:04] cigarettes and he looked at him and
[35:07] brother silus I don't know went through
[35:09] what went through your mind but you knew
[35:11] that it wasn't good for you you knew
[35:13] that it wasn't doing anything good for
[35:15] your health you knew that you were

[35:43] into the
[35:45] hospital and the Lord worked all of this
[35:49] out to deliver our brother from smoking
[35:53] cigarettes

[38:00] Collins and he
[38:03] said I want to be baptized in the name
[38:05] of Jesus
[38:06] Christ he said but I smoke
[38:09] cigarettes he said will you baptize me
[38:12] but the Colin says yes
[38:14] sir brings him in baptizes him in the
[38:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ brings him
[38:23] up out of the water and that was was the
[38:27] last craving of cigarettes the man ever
[38:30] had and he told me that
[38:35] yes there is
[38:37] healing and there is Deliverance in
[38:41] making that effort to do it brother
[38:44] Silas he made that effort he says I want
[38:45] to be baptized he said I want to stop
[38:47] smoking and I want to receive the Holy
[38:49] Ghost brother brother Silas let me tell
[38:51] you something being delivered of smoking
[38:54] is not a promise with baptism
[38:57] but receiving the Holy Ghost is might be
[38:59] delivered from cancer or whatever it
[39:02] might be we do not put enough emphasis
[39:05] on this
[39:07] table it is something that the the
[39:10] founding fathers of the Christian
[39:12] churches I'm talking we were been
[39:13] talking with James this
[39:16] morning they put it's something I'll
[39:20] read some scriptures tonight it is
[39:22] something that cannot be overemphasized
[39:28] it is very very important it's important
[39:31] to take it and it's important to be
[39:34] right when you take it I'm feeling a lot
[39:38] better than I was this morning I wasn't
[39:39] feeling real good brother Manny you've
[39:40] been sick too sister Grace have you been
[39:42] sick also I tell you what
[39:45] I yeah it's it it was bad and and but
[39:50] thank God that we have
[39:53] recovery thank thank the Lord that he
[39:56] lets us get over these things and you
[39:58] know we think that well the Lord's going
[40:00] to heal me and then if he doesn't and
[40:03] you're laying on your back for a day or
[40:05] two he's still healing
[40:07] you it still gets the the glory god
[40:11] still gets the glory I don't care if
[40:12] you're an atheist just the sweetness and
[40:15] the love of God he heals the
[40:19] sick and he does it through his own ways
[40:23] and it may be through antibodies or it
[40:25] may be just through a miracle
[40:28] but he does it and God does it because
[40:31] of one reason because he loves
[40:33] us and this
[40:38] communion supper that we're about to
[40:40] take this Lord's Supper it actually goes
[40:44] back the
[40:47] two What's called the
[40:50] Passover and this Passover we know the
[40:53] original Passover was with Moses and it
[40:56] was one of the 10 plagues that God had
[40:59] placed upon the captors in Egypt and
[41:04] pharaoh and this was the last one and
[41:07] this was the harshest one this is when
[41:09] the death angel was going to come down
[41:12] through the city and it was going to
[41:14] look at the at the doorpost and it was
[41:17] going to look through all of this
[41:19] population and find those that were not
[41:22] lining up with God's word and kill the
[41:25] firstborn son of that family that wasn't
[41:28] lining up and it was one after the other
[41:32] and it brought pharaoh to his knees and
[41:34] it brought Egypt down and allowed Moses
[41:39] and the children of Israel to leave
[41:42] Egypt let's read so when
[41:47] Jesus um was with his disciples they
[41:51] were celebrating this this holiday
[41:55] called the Passover now there were
[41:58] certain holidays they're called Jewish
[42:00] feast days also that God instructed
[42:03] through Moses to for the people of
[42:06] Israel to remember these days and kind
[42:08] of act them out and this is one of those
[42:11] days this is the Passover it's one of
[42:14] the the great feast days that were set
[42:18] in order from Moses and it goes all the
[42:21] way to this day in the Jewish culture
[42:24] and this is the Passover this is the
[42:26] holiday day that Jesus and his friends
[42:30] were celebrating at the Lord's Supper
[42:32] it's like getting your family and
[42:35] friends those close to you together and
[42:37] celebrating
[42:39] Thanksgiving or celebrating Christmas it
[42:41] would be something similar to
[42:43] that let's go to Exodus chapter 1 and
[42:46] we'll go to the original Passover this
[42:49] is when that Death Angel these are the
[42:51] instructions of God that that would
[42:54] cause that Death Angel to pass over
[42:57] the families Exodus
[43:00] 12 verse 1 and watch the
[43:06] similarities in the Passover and the
[43:11] communion and the Lord spake unto Moses
[43:14] and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying
[43:18] this month shall be unto you the
[43:20] beginning of months it shall be the
[43:22] first month of the year to you speak ye
[43:26] into all the congregation of Israel
[43:28] saying in the 10th day of this month
[43:31] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[43:34] according to the house of their fathers
[43:36] a lamb for a house and the household and
[43:40] if the household be too little for the
[43:42] lamb let him and his neighbor next to
[43:45] his house take it according to the
[43:48] number of souls every man according to
[43:50] his eating shall make your count for the
[43:54] lamb so if a lamb was to to big for this
[43:57] household then you would share with your
[44:02] neighbor your lamb shall be without
[44:08] blemish a male of the first year you
[44:13] shall take it out from the sheep or from
[44:15] the
[44:17] goats your lamb shall be without
[44:20] blemish and as Jesus and his disciples
[44:25] are there sitting and Jesus is breaking
[44:28] this bread and giving this wine here is
[44:32] that lamb that was without blemish the
[44:36] sacrificial lamb of
[44:38] God look at the perfect
[44:42] type a male of the first year you shall
[44:46] take it out from the sheep or from the
[44:49] goats and you shall keep it up until the
[44:51] 14th day of the same month and the whole
[44:54] assembly of the congregation of Israel
[44:57] shall kill it in the evening and the
[45:00] whole assembly of the congregation of
[45:04] Israel shall kill it and who killed
[45:09] Jesus
[45:10] Christ it was the Assembly of the
[45:14] Jews look at the perfect
[45:18] line and Jesus is here and he's
[45:21] celebrating this Passover and eating
[45:24] this
[45:25] dinner and here he is is the very
[45:28] manifestation of
[45:30] it and they shall take of the blood and
[45:34] they shall strike it on the two posts
[45:36] and on the upper door of the houses
[45:38] wherein they shall eat it so this
[45:40] sacrifice and this blood is shown to the
[45:43] public just like a Christian
[45:47] Life this it should be shown to the
[45:50] public you notice that they didn't they
[45:52] didn't close the door and Put a Little
[45:54] Lamb's Blood on the inside it had be
[45:57] outside so everyone including the
[45:59] Egyptians including the world could see
[46:02] it so that the the worldly person
[46:05] whoever it is is walking by and says oh
[46:08] here's a
[46:09] Christian oh here's a Jew that really
[46:12] believes in that stuff and when they
[46:14] look at us they should look at us and
[46:16] say that man's a Christian that woman is
[46:20] a Christian not when when they get to
[46:23] meet us and and later on and on and on
[46:26] no right out in the open here I am I am
[46:29] a Christian and that's here what is here
[46:32] right here that's it's on the outside
[46:34] it's all around the door this Blood of
[46:36] the lamb and it's not just with the
[46:39] blood of the Lamb it wasn't
[46:41] just like the Passover was now that
[46:44] blood of the Lamb didn't just cover the
[46:46] outside of the house that blood of the
[46:48] lamb now covers all of the inside of the
[46:51] house it covers all of us not just on
[46:54] our door but it covers our every every
[46:57] being to where even God
[47:01] himself and this is one of the biggest
[47:03] miracles in the entire Bible that God
[47:07] himself the almighty Jehovah Yahweh the
[47:11] be the the beginning in the end the
[47:13] Alpha and the Omega that this
[47:16] God can look down upon this sinful
[47:22] man and not see any of my sins not
[47:26] seeing a sin I have ever C I've ever
[47:28] done in my life he can look down upon me
[47:31] and see nothing but the blood of the
[47:34] Lamb of God and not me and he doesn't
[47:38] even remember my
[47:41] sins how could that be if somebody's
[47:44] done me wrong I can forgive them but
[47:46] I'll always
[47:48] remember I might not hold it against
[47:50] them but I'll always remember it but God
[47:53] doesn't even
[47:55] know how
[47:58] he's
[48:01] God and they shall
[48:03] eat the Flesh in the night roast with
[48:06] fire and unleavened bread and with
[48:09] bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not
[48:12] of it raw nor Soden all with water but
[48:15] roast with fire his head with his legs
[48:18] and with the the pertinence
[48:21] thereof and yet and ye shall I'm sorry
[48:24] and ye shall let nothing of it remain
[48:27] until the morning and that which
[48:29] remaineth of it until the morning ye
[48:33] shall burn with fire and that is
[48:36] why we do not throw
[48:40] away the unused bread that we serve a
[48:44] communion if it's not
[48:46] consumed by us then it is burned before
[48:51] the dawn of another day this scripture
[48:54] right here is the reason for that look
[48:57] at how perfect the
[49:00] Passover and the communion
[49:06] are and that which remaineth of it until
[49:09] the morning you shall burn with
[49:12] fire and thus shall ye eat it with your
[49:16] loins girded that
[49:19] means your belt tied up with your loins
[49:24] girded your shoes on your feet and your
[49:26] your staff in your hand and you shall
[49:29] eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[49:32] Passover so if you're taking communion
[49:35] as I said this morning you're examining
[49:37] yourself it's the Lord's Passover this
[49:40] is something you need to be ready
[49:41] because this is getting this is saying
[49:44] that we're doing this because the Lord's
[49:47] returning so you have your staff in your
[49:49] hand you have your your pants tied up
[49:52] and you are ready to go you're ready to
[49:55] come out of Egypt you're ready to go up
[49:58] in the Rapture you are ready to go
[50:01] because it's
[50:03] coming this is about to be here that's
[50:07] why a man should examine himself before
[50:10] you take this communion this is this is
[50:14] the getting ready point this is the
[50:16] kickoff this is you're you're right
[50:20] there for I will pass through the land
[50:24] of Egypt this night and will Smite all
[50:27] the firstborn in the land of Egypt both
[50:29] man and Beast and against all the gods
[50:31] of Egypt will I execute judgment I am
[50:34] the Lord I like that when he says
[50:37] that and the blood shall be to you for a
[50:41] token upon the houses where you
[50:45] are and when I see the blood I will pass
[50:49] over you and the plague shall not be
[50:52] upon you to destroy you when I smite the
[50:55] land of Egypt Egypt and this day shall
[51:00] be unto you for a memorial and ye shall
[51:04] keep it a feast to the Lord throughout
[51:07] your
[51:08] Generations ye shall keep it a feast by
[51:11] an ordinance
[51:13] forever and when Jehovah sees the blood
[51:17] of his son as I just said it makes it to
[51:20] where God cannot even
[51:22] see our sins and when God passes is over
[51:27] and he and he
[51:29] sees that blood he sees his son he sees
[51:34] Perfection he doesn't see my
[51:39] sins and that is the Passover and that
[51:42] is what Jesus and his disciples his
[51:45] friends that's what they were
[51:47] celebrating in this last
[51:50] supper what what we call the Last
[51:53] Supper it was a celebration actually as
[51:56] happens when once a
[51:58] year Matthew chapter 26 now let's get to
[52:01] the to the feast Matthew chap 26:
[52:05] 17 says
[52:07] this now the first day of the Feast of
[52:10] unleavened
[52:12] bread the disciples came to Jesus saying
[52:16] unto him where wilt thou that we prepare
[52:19] for thee to eat the Passover and he said
[52:22] go into the city to such a man and say
[52:24] unto him the master saith my time time
[52:26] is at hand I will keep the Passover at
[52:29] thy house with my disciples in other
[52:31] words Jesus tells the messenger he says
[52:33] go and tell this certain man that the
[52:36] teacher says my time to suffer the
[52:38] atonement for sin is at
[52:40] hand and the disciples did as Jesus had
[52:43] appointed them and they made ready the
[52:47] Passover and when the evening was come
[52:49] he sat down with the 12 so they made the
[52:51] bread the unleavened bread ready same
[52:55] with with the unleavened bread that's
[52:57] one of the greatest parts of the
[52:59] Passover it means Purity it means
[53:02] Holiness it means without blemish and
[53:05] that's why we don't put the leavon or
[53:08] the yeast in the bread is because that
[53:12] symbolizes that there's nothing outside
[53:15] of this it's just just the wheat and
[53:18] water to to bake
[53:21] it so we have now the table set
[53:27] Jesus had broken the
[53:29] bread
[53:31] and
[53:33] Judas had betrayed him he sent Judas
[53:36] away to betray him and then they sit
[53:39] around the
[53:41] table and Jesus talks with his disciples
[53:45] he talks with his friends let me read a
[53:48] few things that he says John chapter
[53:52] 13:31 therefore when he was gone out
[53:55] talking about Judas
[53:58] Jesus said now is the son of man
[54:00] glorified and God is glorified in him if
[54:04] God be glorified in him God shall also
[54:07] glorify him in himself and shall
[54:10] straightway glorify him little children
[54:13] yet a little while I Am with
[54:16] You ye shall seek me and as I said unto
[54:20] the Jews whether I go you cannot come so
[54:23] now I say so now I say to you
[54:27] remember these disciples had no idea
[54:31] this is a normal holiday that they were
[54:35] celebrating they didn't know what was
[54:37] going on and he has his friends around
[54:41] this table this communion table that
[54:44] we're going to come to tonight and he's
[54:46] telling them these very strange
[54:51] things he says this
[54:56] little he says a new commandment verse
[54:59] 34 a new commandment I give unto you
[55:03] that you love one another as I have
[55:06] loved you that ye also love one another
[55:10] by this shall all men know that you are
[55:12] my disciples if you have love one to
[55:16] another these are Jesus's closing
[55:19] statements this is the last words that
[55:23] he says as a fleshly man
[55:26] when a lawyer when a defense
[55:29] attorney is defending his
[55:33] client he takes all of the highlights of
[55:37] the trial and at the very end he gives
[55:40] his best
[55:42] argument to to so that jury will hear
[55:45] what he says and that jury will make the
[55:48] right decision he wants that to be the
[55:50] last thing in the jury's mind this is
[55:52] the ultimate this is the most important
[55:54] thing that the defense of attorney has
[55:56] to say to save his client and here is
[56:01] Jesus Christ Our Advocate and he's
[56:03] giving his closing statements with his
[56:08] friends around the communion
[56:11] table and he says that you love one
[56:13] another as I have loved you that you
[56:15] also love one another by this shall all
[56:18] all men know that you're my disciples if
[56:20] you
[56:21] have love one to another
[56:26] John 14 start at verse
[56:30] 12 verily verily I say he's continuing
[56:33] to talk around the table verily verily I
[56:35] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[56:37] works that I do shall he do also and
[56:40] Greater Works than these shall he do
[56:42] because I go to the father and
[56:45] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[56:48] will I do that the father may be
[56:51] glorified in the son and you a if you
[56:54] ask anything in my name I will do it he
[56:57] says it twice there and the second time
[56:59] he makes it very very
[57:01] plain if you shall ask anything in my
[57:03] name I will do it we learned from James
[57:06] this morning that you have to ask
[57:08] according to his will though and you
[57:11] have to get into his Spirit to be able
[57:15] to ask according to God's will if you
[57:18] love me keep my
[57:22] Commandments and I will pray the father
[57:26] and he shall give you another
[57:28] comforter that he may abide with you
[57:32] forever
[57:34] wow they're sitting there and they're
[57:36] listening to this and he's saying that
[57:39] that I'm going to pray to the father and
[57:42] he's going to send you another
[57:47] comforter even the spirit of
[57:50] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[57:53] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[57:55] him but you you know
[57:57] him for he dwelleth with you and look at
[58:02] this
[58:03] prophecy the side let's listen to this
[58:06] and shall be in
[58:10] you right here we have one of the
[58:12] greatest promises in the Bible we have
[58:15] the promise of the Holy Spirit coming
[58:18] down and dwelling in a person and he's
[58:22] saying Jesus is saying he dwells with
[58:24] you now and
[58:26] me but he shall be in you imagine the
[58:33] disciples how we would have all loved to
[58:35] have been a disciple we would all love
[58:38] to have been with Jesus and just to to
[58:41] to have seen what he looks like and to
[58:43] hear his voice and to to watch him do
[58:46] these Miracles but he promised a greater
[58:49] promise that know that this is there's
[58:51] something going to better coming if I go
[58:55] this spirit that you've been witnessing
[58:58] is not just you're not just going to see
[59:01] it it is going to abide within
[59:04] you what a
[59:10] promise I will not leave you
[59:12] comfortless I will come to
[59:16] you and
[59:19] yet and yet a little while and the world
[59:22] seeth me no more but ye shall see me
[59:25] because I live you shall live
[59:28] also at that day you shall know that I
[59:31] am in my father and ye in me and I in
[59:35] you he that hath my Commandments and
[59:39] keepeth them he it is that loves
[59:44] me and he that loveth me shall be loved
[59:49] of my father and I will love him and
[59:52] will manifest myself to
[59:55] him wow so when Jesus when when God
[59:58] Almighty looks
[1:00:00] down and there's all of this sin that's
[1:00:03] within me he looks down and he does not
[1:00:06] see that he sees his son and now I am
[1:00:10] with the son so I am with the Father and
[1:00:13] Jesus is saying now you can be part of
[1:00:15] this I am and my father are one now you
[1:00:17] can be one with us
[1:00:27] Judas saith unto him not his carrot Lord
[1:00:31] how is it that thou Wilt manifest
[1:00:34] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[1:00:37] and Jesus answered and said unto him if
[1:00:39] a man love me he will keep my
[1:00:43] words and if my father will love him and
[1:00:47] we will come and my father will love him
[1:00:50] and we will come unto him and make our
[1:00:53] Abode with him he that loveth
[1:00:57] me not keepeth not my sayings and the
[1:01:00] word which ye hear is not mine but the
[1:01:04] fathers would sent
[1:01:06] me i' like to point out here that Jesus
[1:01:09] expects us to live by this
[1:01:12] Bible says if you love me keep my
[1:01:15] Commandments if you don't follow my
[1:01:17] Commandments then you don't love
[1:01:19] me these things have I spoken unto you
[1:01:23] being yet present with you but the
[1:01:27] comforter now here he leaves nothing
[1:01:31] unset but the comforter which is the
[1:01:34] Holy
[1:01:35] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:01:39] name shall teach you all things and
[1:01:42] bring all things to your remembrance
[1:01:45] whatsoever I have said unto you so he
[1:01:49] saying that that this comforter is going
[1:01:51] to come down and not only are you just
[1:01:54] you're not just required
[1:01:56] you're not
[1:01:57] just required to just memorize scripture
[1:02:02] but this holy spirit is so great that
[1:02:05] this word remember John um John 1:1 in
[1:02:09] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:02:11] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:02:15] then later on the word was made flesh
[1:02:17] and dwelt Among Us this word is going to
[1:02:22] come down inside of you and it is going
[1:02:25] to be able to answer every single
[1:02:27] question that's on your heart so when

[1:04:04] unto you let not your heart be troubled
[1:04:07] neither let it be afraid it was going to
[1:04:10] be just a short amount of time after he
[1:04:12] said that that the disciples were going
[1:04:14] to have more fear than they have ever
[1:04:16] felt in their
[1:04:19] lives they were going to be in the
[1:04:20] Garden of Gethsemane and torches and
[1:04:23] staves were going to be coming in and
[1:04:25] they were going to be threatened to be
[1:04:27] killed and Jesus was going to be taken
[1:04:29] and brought before Pilate and brought
[1:04:33] before the
[1:04:35] Sanhedrin and eventually crucified and

[1:05:21] men he's coming and Jesus a Young Man 3
[1:05:25] 3 years old and

[1:20:12] we also observe in this
[1:20:15] church same as Jesus did his let Last
[1:20:19] Supper feet
[1:20:21] washing and supper being ended
[1:20:25] John
[1:20:27] 13:2 and supper being
[1:20:30] ended the devil having now put into the
[1:20:32] heart of judas's carrot Simon's son to
[1:20:34] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[1:20:37] had given all things into his hands and
[1:20:40] that he was that he was come from God
[1:20:43] and went to
[1:20:45] God he riseth from supper and laid aside
[1:20:49] his garments and took a towel and GED
[1:20:51] himself and after that he poured water
[1:20:54] into a baby hon and began to wash the
[1:20:57] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:21:00] towel wherewith he was
[1:21:01] girded then came he to Simon Peter and
[1:21:05] Peter said unto him Lord DST thou wash
[1:21:08] my feet and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:21:12] him what I do thou knowest not now but
[1:21:16] Thou shalt
[1:21:18] know
[1:21:19] Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou
[1:21:23] shalt never wash my feet
[1:21:25] and Jesus answered him if I wash thee
[1:21:28] not thou Hast no part with me Simon
[1:21:32] Peter said unto him Lord not my feet
[1:21:34] only but also my hands and my
[1:21:37] head Jesus saith unto him Jesus sayth
[1:21:41] sayith to him he that is washed needeth
[1:21:45] not save to wash his feet but is clean
[1:21:48] every wit and you are clean but not all
[1:21:52] for he knew who should betray him
[1:21:54] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:21:58] so after he had washed their feet and he
[1:22:00] had and had taken His Garment and was
[1:22:03] set down again he said unto them know ye
[1:22:08] not what I have done to
[1:22:11] you ye call me master and Lord and you
[1:22:14] say well for so am so I am if I then

[1:22:23] feet ye also ought to wash one another's
[1:22:27] feet for I have given you an example
[1:22:31] that you should do as I have done to you
[1:22:34] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[1:22:37] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[1:22:41] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:22:44] him if you know these things happy are
[1:22:48] ye if you do them
[1:22:51] amen let's all stand
[1:22:54] and from that
[1:22:55] scripture Jesus goes to say the things
[1:22:59] that I was saying earlier in the sermon

[1:23:03] and close in prayer my friend brother
[1:23:05] Ron
