to call you a little earlier to check on you and you're here in service so that was a Miss call from me you don't you don't have to respond God bless you and I know that you're making a big effort to be with us we love you very very much we appreciate you making this great effort to be here the Bible says that there is healing brother brandom said that there is healing in the cup and we believe that we believe that there is no case that's too hard we believe that Jesus Christ is the same as I said yesterday and today and forever he's the still he's still the Healer his by his stripes we are still healed and we're going to honor him tonight we're going to do our best to um to honor the Lord Jesus through this communion service brother Silas Al also where are you there you are in the back it's good to see you also brother Silas has been sick and uh he um well enough to come back he just gave me a testimony um wasn't too long ago if you remember brother silus was up there and uh wanted to be baptized and he said said he said brother he said I want to quit smoking and I want to get the Holy Ghost and brought him up there to baptize him and brother Silas said a few days ago um as you know I sent out the prayer request for him he went into the hospital to be prayed to be um because he had low oxygen levels and he had a really bad case of the flu what I didn't know is brother Silas um as started to get sick he looked and there on his counter was a carton of cigarettes and he looked at him and brother silus I don't know went through what went through your mind but you knew that it wasn't good for you you knew that it wasn't doing anything good for your health you knew that you were getting sick and he went and he grabbed that carton of cigarettes and he threw them in the garbage how many times do you're in CL more how many times do people throw something away and then they go back and they say well I'll just keep smoking them he didn't do it he went into the hospital and the Lord worked all of this out to deliver our brother from smoking cigarettes amen it's one of the hardest things from what I've heard it's one of the hardest things to kick that nicotine habit I've told this story I think I told it once once or twice before of a friend of my dad's uh brother um Joseph SS probably some of you folks that have been around the Tabernacle brother Ron glidewell knew him um he was a just a long time brother he I think he went to Northside Fellowship for um at when he went to church and I think he went to uh brother manda's Church also for a while uh just a long time he he'd been around the um been around for a long time he shared a testimony with me one when I was young he said he said Daniel he says I was when I first came and and he said I heard William Brandon preach he says boy he says I just loved it he says but I had this thing he says I couldn't stop smoking and he said I tried I tried everything that I could he said I've been smoking since a young man and brother Brandon passed away and then time went on and he continued to smoke and he went to different pastors and he asked them he said he says I want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he said but I smoke cigarettes he says will you baptize me and most of the pastors said no quit smoking first and then I'll baptize you not just one I went to another one I want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but I smoke cigarettes he said will you baptize me they said quit smoking first make that make that effort first and then I'll baptize you couldn't stop got on a plane flew to Jeffersonville Indiana met the pastor of the brandom Tabernacle Willard Collins and he said I want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he said but I smoke cigarettes he said will you baptize me but the Colin says yes sir brings him in baptizes him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brings him up out of the water and that was was the last craving of cigarettes the man ever had and he told me that yes there is healing and there is Deliverance in making that effort to do it brother Silas he made that effort he says I want to be baptized he said I want to stop smoking and I want to receive the Holy Ghost brother brother Silas let me tell you something being delivered of smoking is not a promise with baptism but receiving the Holy Ghost is might be delivered from cancer or whatever it might be we do not put enough emphasis on this table it is something that the the founding fathers of the Christian churches I'm talking we were been talking with James this morning they put it's something I'll read some scriptures tonight it is something that cannot be overemphasized it is very very important it's important to take it and it's important to be right when you take it I'm feeling a lot better than I was this morning I wasn't feeling real good brother Manny you've been sick too sister Grace have you been sick also I tell you what I yeah it's it it was bad and and but thank God that we have recovery thank thank the Lord that he lets us get over these things and you know we think that well the Lord's going to heal me and then if he doesn't and you're laying on your back for a day or two he's still healing you it still gets the the glory god still gets the glory I don't care if you're an atheist just the sweetness and the love of God he heals the sick and he does it through his own ways and it may be through antibodies or it may be just through a miracle but he does it and God does it because of one reason because he loves us and this communion supper that we're about to take this Lord's Supper it actually goes back the two What's called the Passover and this Passover we know the original Passover was with Moses and it was one of the 10 plagues that God had placed upon the captors in Egypt and pharaoh and this was the last one and this was the harshest one this is when the death angel was going to come down through the city and it was going to look at the at the doorpost and it was going to look through all of this population and find those that were not lining up with God's word and kill the firstborn son of that family that wasn't lining up and it was one after the other and it brought pharaoh to his knees and it brought Egypt down and allowed Moses and the children of Israel to leave Egypt let's read so when Jesus um was with his disciples they were celebrating this this holiday called the Passover now there were certain holidays they're called Jewish feast days also that God instructed through Moses to for the people of Israel to remember these days and kind of act them out and this is one of those days this is the Passover it's one of the the great feast days that were set in order from Moses and it goes all the way to this day in the Jewish culture and this is the Passover this is the holiday day that Jesus and his friends were celebrating at the Lord's Supper it's like getting your family and friends those close to you together and celebrating Thanksgiving or celebrating Christmas it would be something similar to that let's go to Exodus chapter 1 and we'll go to the original Passover this is when that Death Angel these are the instructions of God that that would cause that Death Angel to pass over the families Exodus 12 verse 1 and watch the similarities in the Passover and the communion and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye into all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and the household and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb so if a lamb was to to big for this household then you would share with your neighbor your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats your lamb shall be without blemish and as Jesus and his disciples are there sitting and Jesus is breaking this bread and giving this wine here is that lamb that was without blemish the sacrificial lamb of God look at the perfect type a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it and who killed Jesus Christ it was the Assembly of the Jews look at the perfect line and Jesus is here and he's celebrating this Passover and eating this dinner and here he is is the very manifestation of it and they shall take of the blood and they shall strike it on the two posts and on the upper door of the houses wherein they shall eat it so this sacrifice and this blood is shown to the public just like a Christian Life this it should be shown to the public you notice that they didn't they didn't close the door and Put a Little Lamb's Blood on the inside it had be outside so everyone including the Egyptians including the world could see it so that the the worldly person whoever it is is walking by and says oh here's a Christian oh here's a Jew that really believes in that stuff and when they look at us they should look at us and say that man's a Christian that woman is a Christian not when when they get to meet us and and later on and on and on no right out in the open here I am I am a Christian and that's here what is here right here that's it's on the outside it's all around the door this Blood of the lamb and it's not just with the blood of the Lamb it wasn't just like the Passover was now that blood of the Lamb didn't just cover the outside of the house that blood of the lamb now covers all of the inside of the house it covers all of us not just on our door but it covers our every every being to where even God himself and this is one of the biggest miracles in the entire Bible that God himself the almighty Jehovah Yahweh the be the the beginning in the end the Alpha and the Omega that this God can look down upon this sinful man and not see any of my sins not seeing a sin I have ever C I've ever done in my life he can look down upon me and see nothing but the blood of the Lamb of God and not me and he doesn't even remember my sins how could that be if somebody's done me wrong I can forgive them but I'll always remember I might not hold it against them but I'll always remember it but God doesn't even know how he's God and they shall eat the Flesh in the night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor Soden all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the the pertinence thereof and yet and ye shall I'm sorry and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire and that is why we do not throw away the unused bread that we serve a communion if it's not consumed by us then it is burned before the dawn of another day this scripture right here is the reason for that look at how perfect the Passover and the communion are and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded that means your belt tied up with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover so if you're taking communion as I said this morning you're examining yourself it's the Lord's Passover this is something you need to be ready because this is getting this is saying that we're doing this because the Lord's returning so you have your staff in your hand you have your your pants tied up and you are ready to go you're ready to come out of Egypt you're ready to go up in the Rapture you are ready to go because it's coming this is about to be here that's why a man should examine himself before you take this communion this is this is the getting ready point this is the kickoff this is you're you're right there for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment I am the Lord I like that when he says that and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt Egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your Generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever and when Jehovah sees the blood of his son as I just said it makes it to where God cannot even see our sins and when God passes is over and he and he sees that blood he sees his son he sees Perfection he doesn't see my sins and that is the Passover and that is what Jesus and his disciples his friends that's what they were celebrating in this last supper what what we call the Last Supper it was a celebration actually as happens when once a year Matthew chapter 26 now let's get to the to the feast Matthew chap 26: 17 says this now the first day of the Feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Passover and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time time is at hand I will keep the Passover at thy house with my disciples in other words Jesus tells the messenger he says go and tell this certain man that the teacher says my time to suffer the atonement for sin is at hand and the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them and they made ready the Passover and when the evening was come he sat down with the 12 so they made the bread the unleavened bread ready same with with the unleavened bread that's one of the greatest parts of the Passover it means Purity it means Holiness it means without blemish and that's why we don't put the leavon or the yeast in the bread is because that symbolizes that there's nothing outside of this it's just just the wheat and water to to bake it so we have now the table set Jesus had broken the bread and Judas had betrayed him he sent Judas away to betray him and then they sit around the table and Jesus talks with his disciples he talks with his friends let me read a few things that he says John chapter 13:31 therefore when he was gone out talking about Judas Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him if God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little children yet a little while I Am with You ye shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews whether I go you cannot come so now I say so now I say to you remember these disciples had no idea this is a normal holiday that they were celebrating they didn't know what was going on and he has his friends around this table this communion table that we're going to come to tonight and he's telling them these very strange things he says this little he says a new commandment verse 34 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another these are Jesus's closing statements this is the last words that he says as a fleshly man when a lawyer when a defense attorney is defending his client he takes all of the highlights of the trial and at the very end he gives his best argument to to so that jury will hear what he says and that jury will make the right decision he wants that to be the last thing in the jury's mind this is the ultimate this is the most important thing that the defense of attorney has to say to save his client and here is Jesus Christ Our Advocate and he's giving his closing statements with his friends around the communion table and he says that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another John 14 start at verse 12 verily verily I say he's continuing to talk around the table verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to the father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and you a if you ask anything in my name I will do it he says it twice there and the second time he makes it very very plain if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it we learned from James this morning that you have to ask according to his will though and you have to get into his Spirit to be able to ask according to God's will if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever wow they're sitting there and they're listening to this and he's saying that that I'm going to pray to the father and he's going to send you another comforter even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you you know him for he dwelleth with you and look at this prophecy the side let's listen to this and shall be in you right here we have one of the greatest promises in the Bible we have the promise of the Holy Spirit coming down and dwelling in a person and he's saying Jesus is saying he dwells with you now and me but he shall be in you imagine the disciples how we would have all loved to have been a disciple we would all love to have been with Jesus and just to to to have seen what he looks like and to hear his voice and to to watch him do these Miracles but he promised a greater promise that know that this is there's something going to better coming if I go this spirit that you've been witnessing is not just you're not just going to see it it is going to abide within you what a promise I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you and yet and yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loves me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him wow so when Jesus when when God Almighty looks down and there's all of this sin that's within me he looks down and he does not see that he sees his son and now I am with the son so I am with the Father and Jesus is saying now you can be part of this I am and my father are one now you can be one with us Judas saith unto him not his carrot Lord how is it that thou Wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and if my father will love him and we will come and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers would sent me i' like to point out here that Jesus expects us to live by this Bible says if you love me keep my Commandments if you don't follow my Commandments then you don't love me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter now here he leaves nothing unset but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you so he saying that that this comforter is going to come down and not only are you just you're not just required you're not just required to just memorize scripture but this holy spirit is so great that this word remember John um John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and then later on the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us this word is going to come down inside of you and it is going to be able to answer every single question that's on your heart so when after this when you're you're going along and there's no ordinance in that's written in the Torah there's nothing there that you can that you can figure out Lord how how do I handle I'm trying to look and see how much time that I can spend on my cell phone every day so let me see it's going through it's not written in there but that same holy spirit that is the word comes down in you and answers that question for you and it's not just a cell phone that's just the easiest example it's every single thing how often do I have to come to church how often do we have to have church whatever it is that Holy Spirit is able to answer those questions all questions everyone where are we verse 27 peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid in just a couple hours Jesus was going to be tried and hung on a cross the very next day day and he's saying here he says peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid it was going to be just a short amount of time after he said that that the disciples were going to have more fear than they have ever felt in their lives they were going to be in the Garden of Gethsemane and torches and staves were going to be coming in and they were going to be threatened to be killed and Jesus was going to be taken and brought before Pilate and brought before the Sanhedrin and eventually crucified and here he is he's looking out for the other guy he's saying hey don't be afraid peace I leave with you you have heard how I said unto you I go away and come again unto you if you loved me you would rejoice because I say I go unto the father for my father is greater than I and now I have told you before it come to pass that when it has come to pass you might believe see and I'm telling you so that you're going to remember this Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me he's talking about Satan using men he's coming and Jesus a Young Man 3 3 years old and saying he's coming to get me and he knew what was before him but he had these 12 11 men and a few women to carry on this gospel herea I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and had nothing and hath nothing in me but the world but that the world may know that I love the father and as the father hath gave me commandment and as the father gave me commandment even so I do arise and let us go hence there are cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup so he's saying if you take this and you drink this unworthily then you are guilty of the blood of Jesus Christ but he said let a man examine himself and then he says and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that drink eateth and drinketh unworth worthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world go over and sister if you could start playing and we'll pray over the [Music] ordinances this bread is broken representing the broken body of the Lord Jesus Christ the one that went to the cross for you and me and he told us to do this to come to this same table that I described and do the same thing that he showed his disciples to do he said now you do the same same thing and do it and remember me so as you take these broken pieces of bread remember him remember the one that died for your sins place your sins upon the sacrificial lamb that was without blemish and he'll take them heavenly father as I I hold this bread that represents the body of Our Savior Jesus Christ father this table has been prayed over for 2,000 years Lord we continue to do it in remembrance of Our Savior Jesus Christ now Lord we pray that you would take this bread and that you would bless it father and as we take it and put into our mouths consume it father may it mean that that we would take the body of Jesus Christ and take him into our hearts Lord and take him into our lives and always be with him father we know that it is not the literal body but it represents the body father may your blessings be upon this bread and everyone that takes a peace may they be blessed in Jesus name [Music] amen this wine represents the blood of Jesus Christ that was spilled on the cross and ran out on the ground
