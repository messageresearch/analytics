and I had heard brother Branham quote that um that poem and when I heard we were in a song service and like I said I had just started to church not too long before and brother Chuck Lavin sang that song and I got blessed brother Jonathan and I started clapping and I scared the I scared the life out of the people around me and I didn't really know what had happened I was just I was so happy and just and just praising the Lord and and um his song still means it still brings out about that same emotion from me when I hear it Daniel and I were a little bit late uh coming to church today we stopped by you know the uh the little open-air church that's over on um Miracle Mile and Oracle you know have you ever seen them outside worshiping maybe before church on Sunday morning and Wednesday well we stopped by their sweetest people and I met the pastor and I invited the pastor I said you're welcome to come at any time I said maybe we can get together and worship together sometime and and he said he said oh brother he said something in Spanish but uh I gathered that it meant that they want to do it so yeah so uh sweet people and we all love the Lord Jesus he said he says you know what

they'll be okay God bless you I don't see any other visitors no brother Silas you're not a visitor anymore you've been here for two weeks now yeah you're you're permanent with us God bless you brother um Silas and I worshiped at the same church in Jeffersonville at uh Bible Believers in Louisville right across the river from Jeffersonville with Brother Brad Burgess a pastor he's a he's a good friend I know his dad's well um I have a prayer request here from Sister Martha I think I called her brother Martha last time sometimes I'm worse than Joe Biden you know in in the in the the way that I mess up and stuff I'm sorry I'm I'm improving though sister Martha writes this she says a couple of weeks ago I requested prayer for my nephew Stetson who was in the NICU he was able to go home on the 27th and is doing well thank you so much for your prayers foreign request uh sister Grace isn't here I was going to tell one another we um so uh Stephanie my wife and sister Grace Peterson were working on the church on our room upstairs on Monday and uh no I'm sorry it's on Tuesday it's on Tuesday and um Stephanie called me is late in the afternoon and Stephanie calls me and they were going to go out to buy some stuff and come back and she said she said honey I'm hungry she said could you pick something up for us and um we'll uh we can eat it when we get back to the church and I was just leaving work I think it was like four or four Thirty I said sure So I went up I went and picked up a pizza and I was driving and I pulled up to the church out here and uh there were some hobos out front um so I did my duty and I walked and I I asked the first two to leave and uh they're always nice and they left and then brother Arnie I went and I I looked and there was three more over in front of the planner over here and I could just see the backs of their heads and I walked up to them and one of them I knew him do you remember a couple weeks ago I gave the testimony about Alex the the homeless guy and and we prayed and and he said you know he was just in really bad shape and and he said as I was walking away he said would you pray that the Lord will forgive me for what I've done and I said brother he's he has forgiven you you just need to accept it but I'll pray for you I have a picture here I wish well Jordan I should have sent it to you earlier but I have a picture here so I walked up there and and I kind of snuck up behind them there's three of them three homeless people and they were sitting on the on the ground facing the other way reading something one of them was reading something and I walked up I looked over his shoulder and there was Alex reading to the Bible to these other homeless people [Music] look down at him I said Alex and he says oh Father Daniel [Laughter] I didn't tell him to say that but we we talked for a little while and I was I said Alex I'm really proud of you I'm really I'm encouraged and he says yeah he says since we talked he says I got this Bible and he says I want to start reading it and uh I I was I was really blessed so so they left and um they they walked over over here to there's this bread company over here and they walked over and they opened the dumpster and they started going through that so I ran back over there and I said what are you guys doing and they're like oh well we're just we're just looking for something to eat and needless to say Stephanie and Grace didn't get their Pizza [Laughter] so but yeah keep uh keep praying so then I got home and uh I was praying and I sent out that WhatsApp I lost my page here I sent on that WhatsApp I was on my knees praying I was praying for Alex and it just seemed it just seemed too much for me how could the Lord ever deliver somebody like this and he's strung out on meth and he told me he was taking the fentanyl the the really bad one told me that this last and anyways I went I went back and I can't remember if I was in the church prayer and if I went home and I was praying and I just sent out that WhatsApp um and I read this scripture and as I was praying this scripture came to my mind and I felt like the Lord said Do you believe what you sent out to the people for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen the words of our Lord Jesus that came back and I said Lord I claim that man in the name of Jesus Christ we have a couple prayer requests let's let's stand as as I read them first brother Glenn says this he says I truly want to thank everyone for their prayers the biopsy is still being worked on and I have not yet gotten the results the results are due at any time now I ask for your prayers and your Church's prayers for the results to be negative for cancer I'm praying that is as a benign cyst that can be drained and then removed without any problems of course if the Lord wanted to remove it without any type of surgery or or any more treatment that wouldn't bother me at all either again I am most thankful for the prayers to this point and ask for them to still go forward I know that there are many needs in all the assemblies as I've listened in on the various services online I've been praying for the people that have requested prayers well where one can put it a thousand to fight to flight [Music] where one can put one thousand to flight one can put ten thousand to flight and threefold court is not easily broken God bless you and thank you all I will keep you updated brother Glenn Tomlinson God bless him and sister Angela um it's a strange little Baggett here a lady that she watches her kids a stage four kidney disease and she asked for prayer for her so let's bow our heads friends and if you had something upon your heart if you'd raise your hand in the name of the Lord Jesus Heavenly Father you see these hands Lord God you know the secrets of the heart we bring these requests before you in the name of Jesus Christ and ask Lord that you would meet every need that you would Grant these requests and Lord as I read out of the Book of Mark the words of our Lord Jesus we claim those and we believe them [Music] Lord we claim these things that we've asked in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you all again but then if he'd help me sing Amazing Grace again we have the the blessing of our brother martin here to minister for us I'd like to welcome my brother God bless you [Music] all right I was blind but now why is she so let's just praise him for that word praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God [Music] praise God [Music] there is no praise God [Music] bless you tonight it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen I'm happy to be here with you tonight and you know we're traveling and it's nice to have a place to come amen you know when you're traveling and you you know you don't get the services and then there's a little group somewhere a little Lighthouse or you know you just go in and you just feel like at home amen and like uh our brother I think it's Joe I don't know his name but prayed on Sunday you know we come for each other you know and and we're here for each other that's how we serve the the Lord when we serve each other we're serving Christ right amen let's just uh turn in our Bibles tonight right away to Hebrews chapter one I also want to read from Isaiah but we'll try to be quick on this scripture tonight uh Hebrews chapter think it's uh one we'll start and then Hebrews chapter 2. and then Isaiah 6. Hebrews chapter one let's pray father we want to just once more just to ask you Lord the sacred word we're not even worthy the scripture said to look no one was worthy to look on the book father little read it father so we're privileged tonight that we can look on it and read it and have understanding of it Lord in this hour in this late day in this age we live in of Darkness father we just want to thank you for that Lord we want to confess our our mistakes our failures our any transgressions Lord forgive us Lord wash Us by the water of the word tonight cleanse us Lord Jesus by the washing of the water of the word we'll give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Hebrews chapter 1 verse we'll start with verse 6. Hebrews chapter one I don't know how far we'll get with this tonight I I know it's a Wednesday night but I'd like to try to get to something here that you can take home amen and you can just ponder it and go through the scripture and go through the message and just comb it out yourself he was chapter 1 verse 6 and again when he said when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship Him and of the angels He saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire verse 13 but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thy enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall have be The Heirs of Salvation speaking about Paul speaking about angels Isaiah chapter 6 familiar scripture to all of us I got a little bit of a rebound up here Brothers he Isaiah chapter six that's better verse 1. in the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and the prophet said what is his train that's the angels that was the Lord's train that was following behind him I thought that was so amazing above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face with Twain he covered his feet between he did fly and one cried onto another said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke amen that was an awesome presence amen and then said I woe is me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged amen God would to God that he did that tonight take a coal from off the Altar and touch our lips touch our hearts also I heard the voice of the Lord saying then whom shall I send and whom who will go for us then said I hear am I send me may the Lord bless his word tonight I wanna you may be seated take your seats I want to speak on a subject uh the administration and the influence of angels let's speak about angels amen and uh they're closer than you think and we just want to comb through a little bit of the message and lay a little foundation in that tonight and uh you know as a I I do home inspections I took that certification also I do home inspections and you know if you look at a foundation or a slab that that's cracked and a lot of people will ask me well what's you know is it a poor concrete mix was it the cement or was it you know uh the product itself I said you know a lot of times it's not and sometimes it is but a lot of times it's not it's the it's the base preparation it's the compaction when you're laying that slab brother Daniel they're putting your house on there they wanna you wanna compact that you're gonna have the right gravel the right sand so that's part of the foundation we just look at the at the concrete and say well that's the foundation but it can have a lot of cracks in it and it's because something wasn't prepared right something wasn't done right amen and that's the way it is with the building of God Paul said I as a master builder I have laid the foundation and another bill that they're on Amen so and he said take heed how you build but that Foundation was laid by the apostles and Prophets amen and we've got to stick with that you stay with that word right and that's why the prophet said I preached everything Paul preached so he had that we have that Foundation wonderful isn't it we have that Solid Rock foundation and uh you know I was I was thinking about these seraphims uh in in Isaiah here the holy crying holy holy holy unto the Lord you know they were not they were not just the angels and the seraphims and uh all these Angels were not just robots you know Satan had deceived a third of them so they had a choice they had some kind of choice they made a decision just like we have a have a choice we can go with the word we can stay with the word or we can go off the word we can follow popularity we can be pop the most popular preacher in the message and what would that good what that do us tonight nothing amen not a not a thing it wouldn't it means nothing to God hey man who's who's the most popular you know it God doesn't look at that so you know these seraphims I was thinking about them there's you know different orders of angels we might get into that a little bit but what I'm proposing to you tonight is we're at another Junction of time uh where we have been you know leaning like Isaiah on the arm of Flesh for many years we've been leaving leaning on strong man personalities in the message you know or favorite preachers nothing wrong with that in itself but your your foundation and then you start building you're getting getting off the foundation you're going to stay with the foundation and how how Paul laid it out in the scripture for us so what I'm proposing is that we've been leading on air of Flesh and you know sometimes preachers and uh you know a lot of them sometimes we you know we don't we give them credit but you know that's not they've run their race they've they've run their race they've finished their race they've finished their course and and they've done what they're supposed to do right but now we can't lean on that like Isaiah or Uzziah he was leaning on the arm of the king Isaiah was leaning on the arm of of Uzziah the king so you know there comes a point when God will cut that off and we're still here and we're still here so you know we got to pick up on that where where are we at what what time is it sirs brother sister what time is it how late is it if it was that late then so that's what I'm proposing we're at a junction of time where we're changing the prophet said in the message Rapture we're changing dispensations and it's quickly changing so you know there's more uh more I could say about Uzziah you know as in that respect leaning Isaiah leaning that King had done many things because I had done many good things but he tried to take a preacher's place right he got out of his position see and you could you can never take the place of the Holy Ghost no man amen and you know you can never take the place of Holy Ghost leadership and that's what that's what uh Isaiah needed he needed his own leadership right he had to take the leadership himself because he was leaning the prophet said on on the arm of of the king so you know the Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God that's what we want we want Holy Ghost leadership not man's leadership can I hear an amen the prophets and the church we don't want man's leadership we don't even want brother branham's leadership we want the Holy Ghost leadership amen so you know I'm not much for church Spirits you know National Spirits or you know I travel a little bit so you know I know there's German Spirits there's Canadian Spirits there's American Spirits there's African spirits and we're not Canadians we're not Americans we're not Africans we're Christians Hallelujah that's what we are we're Christians and that means to be christ-like hey man sometimes we take on the net the national spirit and just like the prophet said about America it's just like you know someone walking through the the graveyard laughing making jokes playing rock and roll music while they're doing it and listening to some ungodly thing which was back then our Audrey godford or whatever his name was and all those comedians you know that was the American Spirit but that's not that that's not what we're we're based on that's not our foundation amen this nation was based on freedom of religion that and we and we we stand behind that but you know it's too late now the nations are gone the prophet said I don't pray for America come on now Thanksgiving amen he said I don't pray for Mary I don't pray for the Ukraine I don't pray for the Ukraine I pray for the bride in Ukraine that's the ones God's looking for amen there's 144 000 going to come out of Israel that's the elect the rest are secular and and ungodly and there'll even be homosexualities there right in their politics their politics are just as corrupt as we are amen I'm getting a little you know I'm just going to get into the word tonight Saints I mean this is not I'm not going to try to butter it or you know put uh gloves on time to take the gloves off amen and know where we stand amen and and this is what we we pick up on the mission field you see these things you know you see people trying to take their culture and fit it in the message or make the message fit their culture ah you know you got to hit that thing you know that's that's not that's not message that's not Bible amen you know it's not about our culture it's not about our upbringing you know it's a word culture it's a word language we know amen as a bride so we see Isaiah he was a he was at that time he was a baby prophet amen he was just he had to come down to the altar to pray he had to go down on his knees he had to Humble himself he had to get in the presence of God himself and be influenced by angels amen that's what we need tonight we need to be influenced by angels amen Hebrews 2 I didn't read it but I'll pick it up uh Hebrews 2 chapter 2 verse 1. therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things that we have heard less at any time we should let them slip and if you ever seen it slipping it's now things are slipping I mean people don't even go to church forsaking the assembling of themselves amen as the manner of some is but for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of the reward will we will reap what we sow you stay at a church for a while you'll backslide you'll backslide you'll get lukewarm you know and and everything else starts to fall apart for if the word spoken by angels and the prophet said angels He said Prophets Messengers if the word spoken by the prophet and this day was steadfast and all the other Messengers was steadfast how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation amen you know the prophet said God help that man that walks away from this message God help them they'll be the most disappointed not the judgment isn't that true amen that's the truth amen it won't be the sinner it won't be the prostitute it won't be the the drug addict it will be them that walked away that were right at the doorstep right in the prophet's meetings some of them preached a message for 30 years 40 years and then walk away yeah you know they'll be disappointed disa you talk about disappointments at the Judgment so this Prophet uh Isaiah he had a you know if he had just humbled himself if he had just stayed in his position everything would have been fine but he died a leper with sin you know come come this far in the message and then die like that die in in a backslidden condition and you see it people are doing that you know and and uh it's a sad thing but as for me and my house hallelujah amen as for me I will follow the lord I will follow this message I will I will hang my soul on this message and and you know it hasn't been me because I've I've fallen many times I've made many mistakes but it hasn't been me it's been the grace of God and if God's grace is with you tonight you came out tonight there's something amen there's something pulling you there's something magnetizing you I mean you're not here just to just uh you know because someone will call you up why are you not here amen you're here because you want to be here you're here because there's something God has something for you amen and we should you know uh the prophet said he should have humbled himself you know I read one common commentator say there was uh there was about 80 priests had to go in and pull him out of that sanctuary you know it just it was you could never take someone else's place and the prophet referred to the businessmen they have no business in the pulpit they have no business preaching the word of God you've got to be called and you've got to know you're called amen and so he you know he he he got out of his position if he had stayed in his place I like to use a sports analogy and uh you know I I'm up in Canada we play hockey I think they were talking about it today they're you know with the hockey sticks and all that I think you got the Phoenix Coyotes up here and some hockey teams right in Arizona in the desert amen so you know the the famous guy there in Edmonton he's David uh McDavid Connor McDavid anybody heard of Conor McDavid oh got one Canadian there she's honest anyway I mean it's one of the he's one of the best in the league but you know he he's he's a he's a forward right he's a scorer he but he if he tried to play defense he'd just be out of his place I mean they just roll them over and you know it's it's like that and if I could use a a football analogy Tom Brady how many have heard of Tom Brady oh some more hands go up okay the Tampa Bay Buccaneers one of the best in the league right he's he he's the best but you know Tom Brady once in a while he'll run he'll run the ball and he could do that but you know that's dangerous because if they hit him there goes the there goes the quarterback right but Tom Brady you know a football in the in the hands of Tom Brady that's a big difference right and he and he can he can throw a long ways he's accurate and you know his wide receivers or you know they can go run a lot faster than Tom Brady his short receivers wide receivers you know Tom Brady can't run that fast not as fast as some of them so I'm using that to say you know stay in your position if you're not called to do something then the prophet said don't don't have don't do anything do what God calls us to do and what what he's blessed blesses us with amen so you know I I just I just thought of that you know uh it's it's so easy the prophet said to try to take someone else's place you know uh just like in the scripture the pro the scripture talks about Ephesians 4 11 there's prophets and pastors and teachers and Prophets evangelists and uh and one can't take the other's place amen warning than judgment but you see in the church there is a pastor and that Pastor is a special person he's built to where he can he can put up with all the fusses of the people can I hear an amen he's built that way uh you know I can't do that but he's felt that way he's a burden Bearer he's the ox of the team I remember brother green talking about the the thumb the short you know the the strong one right he can work with all the Ministries but the other ones can't work with with with each other you know but the the pastor he can work with all of them you know and and he can get over you know he can get over himself that's what we need to do brother Dan we need to get over ourselves sometimes we're so big you know so the pastor can do that he said he's a burdened bearer and brother Dan didn't tell me to preach on this by the way by the way no I you know I I don't get paid anymore or you know there's no no nothing in it for me so he's he's a man that can sit down somebody's got something against someone else sat down with them two families and take neither side and reason it out and bring it right back to sweetness oh brother bring it back to sweetness again we got you know we got so you know out of place and not a joint about things just little things and the pastor can bring it back in sweetness see he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things the Evangelist is special man burning like a fireball he runs into the city preach the message gets out of there and goes somewhere else he's a special man the teacher is a special man he sits under the anointing of the spirit able to take the words and put them together by the holy spirit that the pastor or evangelist could not even compare to him right and then we find the Apostle is a special man he's a Setter in order and you know the prophet said about Apostle they call them the nominational denominational realm called them missionaries but he said it's not the right name it's apostle a Setter in order not missionaries they're not you know people think missionaries people that go and build roofs and you know print books and things like that but Apostles set her in order order order why did the prophet preach conduct odor and Doctrine why is that there has to be an order there has to be a proper Foundation there has to be a calling amen he's a Setter in order he didn't say the the you know the Evangelist would set things in order or the teacher would set things in order the Apostle would and and so you know today we're denying that denying the power of that the word If you deny that If you deny any part of the fivefold ministry you're denying the the word you're coming against the word no it's it's that's where we live that's where the rubber meets the road we can say message message message but you know Paul said that that there'd be people in the last day have forms of godliness but would deny the power thereof the power to what do signs and wonders no they don't deny that but the power of God to fulfill his word to fulfill Malachi 4 to fulfill Revelations 10. that's what they're denying that's the first they won't they'll agree with you on Supernatural they'll agree but when you come to the Malachi 4 Revelations 10 Luke 17 30. no that's where it that's where they deny it they'll actually deny it see so he's a set or not he's a man sent from God to do things uh to set things in order the prophet is a special man he's a minute okay here the prophet says about the Apostle this is a warning in judgment you can read it he said you know the Apostle doesn't even have to be a minister isn't that amazing so it doesn't even have to be a minister he says a special man God God schools him and sends him out of a church you know we think of him as a minister sure but he's his office is an apostle to set it in order amen not see not I'm not trying to meddle tonight or you know but I'm trying to fulfill an office you know and we've we've had a prop prophetic office and I believe that prophetic office was infallible let me say it again anyone that's streaming or whatever that prophetic office was infallible he said it in himself he said who will have the power of infallibility it will be a prophet in the last days more Vindicated than any Prophet outside of the Lord Jesus Christ and people say brother Brandon made mistakes sure as a man he he made mistakes but as a prophet as an angel there's no mistake with this message I remember one man he preached he said you know God didn't protect this message from mistakes he protected it from error there's no error in the message amen amen with him with man yes but not with that office that was God in inhabiting a vessel amen sending a messenger to this age like he sent Paul amen and that's what we need to stand for Saints we need to really stand for that because people are letting it slip you know Isaiah saw these angels seraphims holy holy holy they're letting Holiness slip they're letting other things slip see and that's why you know uh that message standing in the Gap I I just go back to that because if the prophet didn't like Isaiah if he didn't see where where he came short if the if the prophet of this day brother Branham didn't see his own complexes he would have been up there with Bud Southwick a a separated man and and then he would have been cut become a bum do you believe that would have happened absolutely the Lord said this is what's going to happen you do what you're thinking of doing you see and so the prophet had to had to reset he had to see that complex of rejection he had to get over that he had to get over himself and we have to get over ourselves and the message our message complex we all sometimes have a message complex and we got we got to overcome that like Elijah I'm the only one remember we spoke that here I'm the only one I'm the only one before he could go across Jordan and into the Rapture he had to realize that there was a Elisha to come and it wasn't all about him and it's not all about us there's a bride Universal amen and we and we and we got to just stay in step I used to be in a marching band and we had to stay in Step did I ever show that here you know I had two or three brothers marching with me left left left right left and that's fine you know you're walking down New York we're on Fifth Avenue marching in the band you know and then but then when you take a corner then then you you got to stay in line and you got to stay in step You're Gonna Stand step for the with the word for this day amen and what the prophet said stay with it and uh you know and my job was to the little guy on the end stay in line stay in line yeah you know and just put your hand out there every Sunday we had a practice Sundays every Sunday the same old same old same old but yet when we get on display in New York or Philadelphia when we got on display and we were in competition then you're on display every eye is on you amen and you're doing Precision marching and and all these things but you know that's where we're at we're on display Saints and everything's gonna be right amen we're heading to the finish line now I want to exhort you tonight hey man just just put on the whole armor of God don't settle for some wind of Doctrine go into the message yourself amen study the message ask your pastor asked an elder amen ask someone that's seasoned in the word what you know if you have questions are good things so um so standing in the Gap was very important because that's if we didn't have if that never happened to the prophet then we wouldn't have Christ The Mystery of God reveal we wouldn't have the Rapture things that are to be we wouldn't have marriage and divorce we wouldn't have future home we wouldn't have any of those things so that that's where the profit was so it's important to stand in the Gap and that's that's why I read that about pastors pastors have to stand in the Gap a lot of times be neutral and and stand in the Gap see you you know and and people want the pastor to take their side can I hear an amen amen sometimes the people you know they're just wait and if he doesn't get on their side they'll go to a pastor that will get on their side oh my you talk about we need to grow up a lot of people need to grow up and the message I mean you've been in the message 40 years and you don't you know hey man we're all guilty sometimes you know if you like the brother said if you can't say Amen say ouch don't frown don't nod say ouch if you're not going to say Amen say ouch you know you never get an amendment out of some people the word of God is yea and amen it's yay and amen say Amen agree with it even if you're not living it and then you become it you'll become it say amen that's right I'm convicted by that but Amen brother you're right amen so you know uh those Soul pastors are special people you know there's I'm talking about the administration of angels now we're all under the administration the umbrella of of a of an angel for the age which was the prophet of this day but there's other Administrations you know the prophet said your pastor is an angel why is quiet your pastor is an angel to the church just like the prophet was an angel to an age but the prophet wasn't a local pastor amen amen you know there's lots of spirits out there that will claim that but the pastor wasn't the prophet wasn't a local Pastor he's not my pastor you know what the prophet said I would never be a successful pastor I got an amen there amen he will he said I would never be successful he passed her 17 years never took an offering put it all in church I thought well that's pretty successful saw signs and wonders no he said that wasn't my calling do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry amen so that's what he did so um let me go on uh in the order of angels you know it's strange because Hebrews 13 says be not forgetful to entertain strangers for some have entertained angels unaware amen you ever you ever meet a stranger to tell you something and you thought boy that was God God use that stranger tell me something oh my so there's minor Angels there's major Angels there's archangels there's seraphims there's cherubims there's living creatures so many types of you know a t a good teacher get on that and break it all down a good teacher that sometimes the ministry you see that can put that together see but now we're living in a Time you know when there's like we read in the scripture that there's ministering spirits sent forth from the presence of God to minister to them that will be the Heirs of salvation amen and and the prophet talks about he said there's an angel there's an angel when they stand in the Pulpit there's an angel ministering to you God sends angels to minister to you to stand in the gap hallelujah amen I was just got a phone call today where I made a phone call to a man I uh I I passed on some work to him because I I couldn't take it so uh he was a home inspector and an inspector and uh there was a there was another gentleman that was a a a a a friend of both of us that had been an inspector and just before I came I heard he was in the hospital and I heard he was sick and I heard he had cancer and it was pretty serious but Aaron so you know my heart goes out to those people you know I just there's a Ministry in hospitals just to minister to people you know just to give them a little hope you know give them they might accept the Lord even and I've seen it happen and you know I went in I just he didn't expect me I hadn't seen him for years and I just walked in and you know how you doing Brian and you know he had lost a lot of weight he was pretty thin and you know but he's he's just lit up you know when he's seen me he said Oh Martin thanks for coming in you know and I said well you know I just I I heard you were in the hospital I wanted to see you and and his brother was standing there and uh so we didn't have any one-on-one time so his brother walked out and you know he said what have you been up to and I said well I just got back from Africa I've been doing some Mission work always said that's great he said that that's good Martin he said you know and then his brother walked out and uh he said you know he said Martin he said would you would you have a prayer for me not Chris not a Christian not never talk to me about God or the Bible or anything you know and he said would you have a have a little prayer for me and I said Brian I sure would I sure would and I took his hand and he said sit here on the bed with me and we held hands and you know I could just feel him squeezing my hand and you know he just wanted someone to pray with him he said I you know I don't know what's going to happen you know it's terminal they're going to do another biopsy and it's way in the chest so well Brian you know God heals and God Saves and uh we'll just commit it to the Lord and we'll commit you to God and he said I'd like that amen I just so receptive you know it was just like a you know God had just got him down to his Deathbed and that there he was like a child and he just he just he was just wanting something spiritual and you know we had a nice prayer together and we smiled I shook his hand and you know I just said everything's going to be all right you know and I got a call that call phone call today said this guy said did you hear about Brian I said no I said I I was just with him I said in the hospital before I came he said he passed away two days ago and you know you know and I thought he said what do you think Martin he said because this other man was a Christian too and never spoke to him he said I felt he felt kind of guilty because he never witnessed him I said you know what I think he made it by just by his attitude and his respect just for his respect I said I I think he made it I like to see him on the other side amen praise God I I received that brother amen so standing in the gap a pastor's got to do that see and that and that's what we're anointed to do in the last stage by those living creatures and that's what the prophet did you know they asked the prophet you know are you going down to fuss with those denominational people and everything he said no I'm going down to guard that Mercy Seat the the mer the ark the word I'm going down the guard that and that's what we're here for brother Daniel we're here to guard that Ark that word amen we're not going to let it slip if they want if others churches want to let it slip let them let it slip but we're not going to do that amen we're going to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen so so I want to finish with another type of angel one you know we could talk about the cherubims and the seraphims and the living creatures I love because those are the throne guards you know uh Ephraim Reuben Dan amen the ox Judah the ox the lion the the man the eagle amen and then the prophet said you got Matthew Mark Luke and John and said now you got like Apostles prophets teachers bastards what are we doing we're guarding something and that when you're guarding something there's something precious there there's something worth value when you put a fence up when you have a security there's something of value and God values his word amen and so you know the these angels we don't want to get into that but you know this there's another Angel that's probably closer to you than you realize and uh you know I've had people tell me about visions and and seeing angels and all that and that's fine you know that that could happen like you know uh Joseph Smith he probably did see an angel you know there's an example in the Old Testament to two prophets and one lied and said an angel came to me they told me told me to tell you to come to my house but he lied there's there's all kinds of angels there's a lot lying spirits that are sent so we got to discern it how are you going to discern it by the word amen the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents and experiences if they experiences are okay as long as they line up with the word amen so amen so you know you don't go by experience I mean you know a lot of people had good fantastic experiences I I've had men I've had a man sat in my house that was in brother brana's meeting when he was a little boy he was a Haida Indian and and the prophet said told his mother she's praying for his mother but he said that child when he grows up he'll be he'll be in a fire there'll be Fire and Ice but God will bring him through it they didn't know what he was talking about and he grew up to be an Air Force pilot and when he was flying over Alaska his Pilot crashed in the mountains he ejected and he landed in a bunch of this area of snow and ice and the plane was burning there in front of him and his mind went back to the prophet when he was a little boy and he said you'll see fire and ice but he said God will take you through and he said it was fantastic testimony he talked about he he went to Full Gospel businessmen and and gave that testimony about being a brother man's meetings Full Gospel businessman have a lot to answer for so does this generation amen and and you know when he was he was telling us he was telling me that that testimony and he had been in many message churches but uh and then another brother sitting with me he he turns to him and he says you know he says uh you just came from Eastern Canada you were in a pat you were in a Baptist Minister's house and you you were witnessing the message to that Baptist Minister and in in his living room there's an organ and on the organ there's a name of a little girl that died and they dedicated that organ to the little girl he said you just came from there and the brother looked at me he says couldn't believe it he said how did you know that he said I just saw it you're talking about gifts you know but they experienced us but they have to line up with the word those gifts like discernment that is not a Pulpit Ministry what we saw was a sign of the Messiah that was one in a generation amen but I've seen that I've seen that gift work I've seen that gift work on Pulpit disordered me but it was only so that they could get influence that they could get money that they could use that influence themselves sad but true how haven't we haven't we fed on the word enough to discern that we should know that and yet people will run after those things wow what a Ministry and I've sat under the I've sat in those meetings and it's wow you know and told me one man told me what I was wearing in my bedroom what color suit I had on and how I changed my suit is that true Brother Martin yes it's true yeah they all go crazy what what's like what sign what Wonder made us believe the message what Vindication was it that made you believe the message no you heard the word you heard an eagle scream that's what I wasn't in any of the meetings I never seen those things I heard the tapes but I never seen any of that myself it was the word that came and and and and it and it just Shone light on that seed amen and so you know yes fine but let it line up to the word if you if you say you got a gift in the fivefold ministry it better line up to the word not your own Doctrine amen so I'm I'm just being a little bit forceful tonight amen but that that's what I'm called to do I want to fulfill my office and you know uh Paul Paul talks about these angels they're also celestial bodies bodies terrestrial Glory the glory of one Celestial and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the Sun the Moon and another glory of the stars and they all differ from one another in glory so also as a resurrect direction of the Dead is sown and Corruption it is raised into corruption it is sown a dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness that is raised in power it is sown a natural body it has raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and a spiritual body and so is it written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit we have another body Saints second Corinthians 4 and 18 and while we look not at the things that we see but the things that we do not see for the things which we are seeing are temporal but the things we do not see are eternal second Corinthians 5 and 1 for we know that if our Earthly body of this house Tabernacle be dissolved we will have a building not a house made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven earnestly Desiring how much are we Desiring that body you know how much are we Desiring that body change the Lord woke me up here last in the last six months and it was about you know early in the morning and he and the voice said you're not expecting the rapture boy I hit the floor over there I just hit the floor it was just like and then I realized I'm not I'm busy doing this busy doing that and serving the lord doing this doing that but I've lost that expectation that I had and you had when you first came in that you got in by the skinnier teeth and you didn't know if you had next week that expectation earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with that body from Heaven amen so that's what we're that's what we're losing that's what we need to stir ourselves up put ourselves in remembrance of these things though you know them but be stirred up see by these things earnestly Desiring Matthew 18 and 10 and you don't need to turn to it but uh I'll just read it take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven little ones you have representation you have a representation on the other side see they're Angels they're Messengers do you know you have an angel you have a messenger every one of us has an angel every one of us has a messenger amen Hebrews chapter 3. series in Jeffersonville IN 57 the prophet said in them days he was talking about Peter in Acts chapter 8. he was talking about Peter being released from prison and an angel came and opened the door right Angels the administration of Angels in the early church the administration of Angels in the last day Church the last day book of Acts oh I'm excited brother uh you know we're in contact with angels ministering spirits a five-fold Ministry also amen we have everything we need you know and he says here about that book of Acts incident he says and and he'll he opened the doors for Peter so Peter runs to John Mark's house and in them days they said the prophet said you just didn't open the door you had to look through and see who was there because they'd kill you sometimes to be a robber or someone you know so the the sister went to the door if you open the door they'd kill you he said he opened the she opened the door she said oh oh it's Peter they said oh my he's dead they must have killed him in prison that's his name that's now that's his Angel standing there they must have killed him they'd done he done got into his glory his glorified body or you know that theophany body he said he must have went into his theophany said you remember how we took it in the big diamond how it reflects the light how it went through back there and this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved so they thought Peter was uh in his in his theophany and he goes on to say we have we have a one already waiting he's quoting Paul and uh they thought Peter had done died and that old body had dropped and they just buried it they'll bury it in a few days and he entered into his angel into his angel his spiritual body that was his angel that was his messenger he said he entered it into it there see that theophany will pick up this body so and we enter it in into it there death will take us there the prophet said we bypass that death will take us there but I want to show you something else if you read read read the message and look look in context he said see that theophany body they thought he was in ethiopathy body his angel the body that body that's already prepared it could it see in that form it it couldn't shake hands see but Peter could shake their hands so he was an industry it has that the oven he has no chance to shake like nothing to Shake in that form but it's an image of a man that come down and was knocking at the door that's what they thought she said no it's Peter he's standing there they opened the door and he walked in and there he was now Peter has been Peter had been delivered by this light this angel who is this Melchizedek I won't be too much longer just stay with me for a few minutes who is this Melchizedek the prophet's talking about the eagle story you he said you know you then after you recognize the word of God like the eagle heard the scream he said then you left the other thing you've been then formed into the living image of the Living God you live then been formed into the living image of the Living God that's Genesis 1 27 when he made you a spirit man first you were made Spirit man first before you ever come to this he made you in Genesis 1 26 27. let us make man in our own image in the image of God what image was that the prophet said when he came out from the thoughts of God when Christ the anointing the logos came out it was in a form of a pillar of Fire which which then became a man in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh the logos he said he was a pillar of fire when he went out that's the form Paul met him in he had more than any of the disciples that saw him in the flesh the prophet said he met him in the form that he was in Genesis amen Saints amen we met him in that same form he took his picture with a prophet in this age we've met him in that same form the pillar of Fire so he said then then you heard that eagle scream see the new birth then you've been formed you're starting to be formed into the living image of the Living God see then you left the other thing you're formed you heard from your theophany you heard from your angel amen that which you were before the foundation of the world you heard something and it and it clicked amen so that's what the message is about it's about election it's about predestination it's about our Eternal destination and where we come from where we're going back to see that Pillar of Fire you know it came down became a man in Melchizedek it became became God and two angels the prophet said that met Abraham and told Sarah what she was doing in the in the tent right he said Gabriel and Michael just he took up some potash and 16 elements blew it and Gabriel and Michael stepped in went down with God then he said he made himself a body and then he stepped in he said that was God and two angels amen so Saints this is our heritage this is how it started this is how it'll end who is this Melchizedek who is this Melchizedek that that that God came down with two angels he's the same one that came down to with two angels and spoke to Abraham then he then he made another body and and uh stepped into that which was Melchizedek then Melchizedek we didn't see him anymore then he then he then he stepped into Jesus Christ made himself a body stepped into it amen sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not Hebrews 10 but a body thou has prepared me Hebrews 10 7. Revelation 10 7 he came down made himself a body chose a little body in this age a little prophet amen and use that vessel that angel to minister to those that will have eternal life It's a Wonderful message Saints and we just need to dig in we need to dig into it it's not about church attendance it's not about ties it's not all about that it's not about it's more than that it's not about just Doctrine it's a person without beginning of days or ending of life Amen in Hebrews chapter 6 Paul says let us now therefore go on go on to perfection let us lay aside the principles of the doctrines of Christ baptisms and doctrines and we argue over this and I said let's go on to Perfection amen not laying again the foundation the foundation's been laid in the message we've had a foundation amen we just need to build properly on it and and that's what Paul said in Hebrews chapter chapter 6. and then Hebrews chapter 7 after he's talking about that then it goes into Melchizedek chapter 6 says Man chapter 7 is God Melchizedek the Eternal Elohim that's who that's who's here Hallelujah that's who's here with us Saints and that should excite us I mean you know it you're going to have your trials you're going to have your daily battles and sometimes that doesn't mean a lot but you know what if you get a revelation of that those trials and those tests and those things that get you down that won't mean as much because you see something greater not on the things Paul said that we see but the things that are unseen amen that's what we're looking to the Unseen amen how many that you know what if if I was there and then I'd just be jumping I'd just be jumping up and down yeah we're looking to the things that are unseen we're looking at this milk has it who is this milk has it again me it's the same one that was that was in Jesus Christ if the Same Spirit dwells in you that that raised Christ from the dead he that raised Christ from the dead who was he God right and then Jesus turns around says destroys us Temple and I'll raise it up who is he that was him that was it that was the I am talking in Jesus there's the godhead it's so simple if that Spirit dwells in you and the prophet said you will raise yourself up how are you going to do that by your theophany by that body that was prepared before the foundation of the world that in Genesis 1 26 that's how you're going to do it when the prophet makes a statement like that he's not joking he said you will raise yourself up and you realize this Melchizedek the power that's in you you go out and create worlds and go live on them is that too big for us are we kind of hunkered down on just just oh I'm just surviving I'm just overcoming we should be victorious amen who cares if my hip doesn't work I don't care if brother Aaron is my body's breaking down amen who cares oh you know I I said when I was going overseas they they told me that our doctor said I don't know you're going overseas like well even if I have to crawl I'm gonna go amen and God sustained me God sustained me and he'll sustain you but you got to have a vision you gotta you gotta have a revelation of he that's within you is greater than he that's in the world who is this Melchizedek who was that theophany that was standing there that served Abraham communion amen oh my it's the Eternal one amen who became Jesus Christ amen Jesus had a beginning he had an end right he died God can't die amen neither can you die neither can I die the prophet said if someone you hear someone say you I died don't believe him they're very much alive tonight and they're here a cloud of witnesses and a theophany that you have sitting beside you has come to church with you sister amen but oh yeah well you know I don't feel it or I don't see it you don't have to feel it or you don't have to see it you just believe it and God will manifest it in Germany there when I when I was I didn't say that in the in the bishop report but in Germany under his ringin's church there was a sister that had cancer and and and it was terminal she knew that it was her time was close they uh she was at home and she wanted to get to service one more time she went on a Sunday before she died and she said I know I'm going to die she said but she told Brother Andre Dre's ring and she said I have such a piece that it scares me he said I have such a piece about this isn't that the way to go he said I have such a piece it scares me he said would you I just want you to pray one more time and and brother Andrea said there was a presence there that her angel was there and he said the word theophany came to him your theophany is here you know it was coming closer it was coming closer she was going it's coming closer and then standing closer and uh you know that theophany is only a few feet away amen and uh another little sister in Germany came up to me she said I was in the baby room said you know and I was I was you know you know how hard it is sometimes mothers you're taking for your children and you're distracted and all those things but she was you know she she had an ear open and all of a sudden she said Brother Martin she said I was up in the corner of the room watching myself fix the baby is that too Supernatural for us is that strange that shouldn't be strange to us it the message is full of it the prophet was in his theology when he prayed for Georgia Carter up in the room his theophany I got there before he got there try to explain those things you can't but it's real I know it's real like I said I was in Poland and I was I was up here and I was thinking how can I do that because there's two of me there's two of you there's your there's your spiritual man you're you have a body Celestial and a body terrestrial amen and and the prophet says here I didn't I didn't finish that quote you did I say that you've heard from your theophany when you heard that eagle scream you've heard from your theophany there's two places now I'm not just taking one isolated quote but he said then you've heard from your theophany your word body because your word body knows everything and we just bypassed it but we're in touch we're in touch I'm in touch and I'm waiting I'm waiting just to step into that one of these days amen you're gonna see like Enoch you're going to see a path you know Moses and Elijah they were in their theophonies on the mount Transfiguration and Peter James and John recognized them the prophet said how did they recognize him because they had theophonies that's in eternity you see and they were in that presence and that's why we don't recognize these things we don't get in the presence of God enough we got to be like Isaiah let's get down to the altar let's come here early and pray let's not show up in five minutes oops maybe I'm getting out of my place here maybe I'm trying to put things in order no the pastor will will do that amen but there there there's there's a place for it amen you know and and sometimes it's easier if someone else says it come early not the last but coming let's pray get down to the altar go like guys Isaiah down to the altar to the prey let's go down let's go down let's go down to the river to pray amen praise God Amen so you've heard see from your theophany and he talks about uh the male Transfiguration Moses and Elijah there so he says the prophet says thank God for these the opening of these Seven Seals that we can understand these things where in the denominational world do you hear about theophanes huh when you when you were in denomination but did you hear about your theophany amen it it took someone that was on the other side that went into his theophany that experienced that amen thank God for the opening of those Seven Seals that we see these things and things can come into order in the church amen so Hebrews 6 like I said leaving the principles let us go on to perfection amen and and uh Hebrews 10 a new body a body thou has prepared me God has prepared a body for us things that are to be when the prophet preached the rapture and then he couldn't finish that the next thing he preached was things that are to be that was the end of the Rapture amen and and uh you know the prophet preached many things like uh when he preached on that things that are to be he says he uses the the context in my father's house are many theophanes many mansions that's what he uses and the prophet was preaching his own funeral he said this sounds like a funeral text well it was God was taking him off the scene and he said I'm going to use it now things that were prepared for you when you came as a baby are things are prepared for you when you get to the other side things are being prepared now amen and you're being prepared by what listening to your theophany you see the new birth didn't do that for us see well you needed more than the earnest at Pentecost we're not the process we're not going just back to Pentecost the book of Acts we're going back to the Garden of Eden where we had Dominion over the whole thing you see that Pentecost didn't produce a Rapture tongues of fire came down yes fulfill the scripture Joel 2 28 but it didn't produce a Rapture neither did 1906 producer Rapture but this will produce a Rapture this message will produce a Rapture to get us back to the garden and and that image that we were in with no sin amen and we'll build and we'll plant amen will occupy remember we'll build new houses amen you know you know and and you'll be with your Eternal mate and you'll say Oh Sister Marjorie uh you know how would you how would you like this constructed well I like the Contemporary our architecture mid what is it modern contemporary or the one you like right something like the houses down here you know you're going to have a say in it you're going to create that yourself you know how would you like this you know and and your Eternal mate will be there you'll you'll be you'll be there that'll be real we'll plan we'll build we'll occupy no and no one else will take it over and that's why I love the Earth so much this is my world this is our world and it's beautiful from the from the you know from the jungles of Africa to to the to the Arctic then I've been in the Arctic and that's got its own Beauty too but they won't have we won't have snow thank God for that but if you see the Arctic without snow it's beautiful there's some beauty up there amen so that's where that's where we're going things that are to be and I wanted to just prick your conscience a little bit just think about that now pray God reveal this to me reveal this to me when you heard from your theophany you see Pentecost didn't produce it and the earnest doesn't produce it we've been given Ephesians we've been given the earnest of our Salvation that's only the down payment what they had then was only a down payment now we got the full thing it's paid off he paid it off Revelation 10 he paid it off now we heard from our original theophany and we're going home we're going home soon so let's prick ourselves let's let's not let these things slip we're under the administration and influence of angels and you've got that angel see and that's why you know that's why the prophet labored on who is this Melchizedek read that message again it's just a wonderful message see and and we wouldn't have had that if he didn't get over his complex Jesus said if I have told you Earthly things and you believe me not how shall you believe if I tell you Heavenly things not everyone can receive this even in massive circles not everyone can receive it and no man he says has ascended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven they're looking at them you're looking at me but there's another part of me another Martin Warner that's in heaven and he's standing just to hear that's not an imagination that's real and it's just that we can't see that dimension amen so so the prophet I'll just end with this the prophet maybe the musicians could come the prophet was talking about being past the curtain of time and he runs into his his daughter Sharon Rose and she's a young lady maybe like this young lady amen I don't know how old you are sister but I won't say but just a young lady didn't recognize her can you imagine you were talking about angels last night by the way remember you were talking about angels that's what we're talking about tonight he didn't recognize his own daughter why because when he saw her she had crossed eyes their eyes were crossed from suffering with pain a little baby that couldn't tell you how much it was suffering flies were on its face that's the last time he saw her on Earth now he sees her as a young woman beautiful young woman amen who are you don't you know me daddy I'm your Sharon Rose well I don't understand this he said I don't understand this he said Daddy don't you remember what you preached how did she know what he preached [Music] how did you know she was in her theophany her word body she knew because she knew all things and she knew the message of this hour she knew about who is this milk she could have said Daddy don't you remember what you preached on who is this Melchizedek and that's what you said don't you remember what you preached because in that body there's no yesterday There's No Tomorrow there's just now amen and you are the prophet you are the angel of this age you had a message for this age and that's what's brought you here to this place nothing but perfect love for the word amen because it's not be strong delusion will come even in the message not because you don't have the word but because you don't love the word you don't love the word enough you got to love it with all your soul all your mind all your heart that's how we need to love it we gotta we gotta forsake ourselves amen when you love it like that and you have that character like that like the prophet had when he was when he was dying in that intern turned him over and he's he's he he groaned in pain and and then he said oh I'm sorry he said and the prophet said oh no uh I forgive you for that even in that condition amen and he was ready for that body that body was prepared and you could tell his vessel was ready but we're so close now Saints this is the evening time it's later than we think and those bodies are coming to this body we've got representation Genesis 1 26 like I said when you have representation amen that's a different thing we we had representation on the cross when he died the prophet said you died in him and then when he was buried he said you were buried in him you were buried in it I was buried in him I was there that day you were there that day that's not just a colorful phrase we were there you were in him Amen brother you were in him there you died on that cross when I got saved that's what I saw I saw the cross over the over the Euler Stadium right over the Euler Stadium the one they're going to tear down brother Allen I thought I saw my sins and I saw Jesus hanging there your sins are there it became personal it was a personal thing and although I tried to run away from it I tried to run away from my calling I told you people that I had a complex I almost lost my lost my Ministry lost everything could have lost my wife amen but I had representation see I had you ever don't matter what you did amen God like the brother said God's forgiven you for that your your theophany is never sinned and you had a representation there so he said when you were buried you were buried in and then when you Rose he rose you Rose in him he said when he was on that cross he said he paid for your sins but he said you paid for your own sins [Music] that's a that's a mouthful why because you were in him yes he paid for it but you were in him so it's paid that's why you can raise yourself up that's why you've got a body that will raise yourself up amen I'm not trying to get technical I'm just saying these things are real and it's time for these things it's time you don't hear from your theophany just once that was the earnest you wouldn't then you got in contact become born again the new birth but you're a spiritual babe and the prophet lays that out and who's Melchizedek said you only become a spiritual babe then you have to grow up hear more from your theophany what is it that's speaking to you in the night [Music] what is it that reveals a word to you it's the Holy Ghost it's that eternal spirit it's that theophany that connection you have and we're going up into that so the earnest we got more than the earnest amen we're changing dispensations amen foreign beloved now are we the sons of God let's Stand Together now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is we'll have a body like his own glorious body the theophany will pick up and the prophet said it knows where the ashes it knows where the calcium it knows where the 16 elements are so if you go by way of the grave don't worry don't fear like that sister he said I have such peace he said she said it scares me and and and just that Wednesday that was Sunday she died and I come in on a Wednesday and I spoke on the theophany and she just had that experience on Sunday and her husband was just yes and the family the children they were yes moms in her new body how Hallelujah glory to God Amen that's what we got we got the real thing amen and other people are playing Church don't play Church in this message Saints amen it's real don't play with it don't walk away from it amen let's go down to the river to pray let's let's come early like Uzziah let's pray for the pastor the burden Bearer The Prophet said when he you know he he ordained the Church in in Tucson when brother Perry moved here and his family moved here sacrificed moved here said now they're going to need song leaders they're going to need deacons they're going to need support they're going to need this that they're going to need helps they're going to need now now you said you go out and tell everybody about this church you go out there and tell everybody about this church tell everybody about this pastor this pastor has got a burden for Souls amen this pastor has got a burden for the Lost amen like I was a man on the street I met a man that was backsliding this about this message he knocked on my door at the YMCA out of a million people one in a million saints were one in a million you're that one in a million God knocked on your door he sent an angel to me a complete stranger he said you want to come to church say come to church with me that's all he said he said you know that's all you have to say let him get in front of the pastor let him see the burden and if I was here in Tucson I'd I'd sit under under this pastor I would I would because the burden is the most important thing you've got to have the burden you can you can know the word inside out but if you don't have the ox anointing if you can't get in between the fusses of the people amen so did you get something tonight I hope you got something you have an angel hey man Hallelujah thank you brother amen that little guy clapping away there you know babies have angels he's got a theophany just like Sharon Rose amen and we're in connection with that I don't know I don't know what to sing sister I [Music] maybe just do you know that greater than all my sin I think you know your theophany has never sinned [Music] think about it your word body is never thin and we're looking at this and Satan is telling yeah but you did this but your theophany brother Arnie has never sinned oh raise your hand sister God your theophany has never failed it's never made a mistake it's perfect it's infallible Hallelujah I could just jump in Shelties oh my what we have in our hands we don't realize Wednesday night I know I kept a little bit I'm going away so it's like the Evangelist he can preach and then run away pastor's got to deal with it [Music] amen order order order order Order in the Court amen the judge is here The Advocates here the comforters what is the Holy Ghost it's a seal it's a sign it's a comforter it's all of that we have need of it's a new body amen it's a new world amen we're just starting Saints oh my I feel my theophany is very close right now and he's saying preach it brother martin preach it say Amen brother say amen sister amen it's time to go home you've never done it in the first place hey man let's go back to that where we came from let's not keep looking at this let's not keep looking at one another's fault let's look at let's come up a little higher John said come up higher amen start hearing from your theophany I better stop [Music] later [Music] mother Aaron started out with that it's not what you can do it's what he did it's what he'd done for us amen Saints we're the cream of the crop I'm looking at Burger I'm looking at the cream of the crop this is the cream of the crop amen and when I go to Africa in those places and they haven't got nothing two sticks to rub together and they got this great big smile they're just loving the Lord lose their house they're living alone lose everything they're loving the Lord how can you do that because your theophany is doing it it's behold in the face of the father amen it's greater than all my sins to praise him I will [Music] I cannot fall oh my I can't fall I can't fall sister and then the prophet said she can't fall the bride can't fall you make mistakes yeah dust yourself off repent get up again but you'll never fall God will see to it amen oh my I'm my heart's dancing amen one place I was they were saying that the pillar fire was going across the pulpit it's going across I can feel it I can feel Angels I'm not just imagining it I'm not just excited I can feel the presence of angels can you feel yours amen we get in that one Accord you watch what'll happen amen oh my I could just scream and shout amen like we were coming down through those Seven Peaks everything I could do Martin stop I should have done it Scream and Shout Oh My My Angel was so close one of these days Saints I'm just gonna step in amen greater than the whole my sins foreign [Music] I wish I had 30 more minutes brother wonderful there's there's a testimony some of the things the brother said tonight I don't have time tonight to tell them but I can testify that they're the truth I can testify by my own experiences that some of these things that our brothers said about the theophany are true because I have been there Job chapter 1 verse 6 says this now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord sister Shirley who are those sons of God who we have a representative over there friends and it is us it is this person right here not this corruptable flesh not this man that you see but there is another man there is another woman over there that is in the presence of God a theophany being I wish I understood it better oh it's just so wonderful It's a Wonderful is it good to be here tonight I want to I do want to tell something really quick our brother said he talked about the different offices in the fivefold ministry and brother Branham himself and he was quoting brother Graham say I could never be a successful pastor I've told the congregation here brother martin but I'll tell this tell this for you and and brother Alan that when I was in Ministry in Jeffersonville brother Billy Paul brought in an old Ledger for the Branham Tabernacle and he wanted me to I was in charge of the archives he wanted me to file it away and um it was in a it was in a file cabinet and I asked him for the key gave me the key and I started going through the the stuff and reading it and it was a ledger from 1934 up until about 1946. and on that ledger was the offering brother Brown said he never took an offering but they took an offering in the church and it had a it had a recording of that offering for I don't know what it was 34 to 10 12 years it was usually like 90 cents a dollar a dollar 25 that this offering was and then when brother Branham got his commission and he went out into the field the ministry just exploded the Branham Tabernacle people started coming in thousands of people coming through all the time but all that time there in Jeffersonville it just stayed small Brother Martin God bless you all you feel good we are you blessed tonight but Alan if you would come and close in prayer my friend again this is Easter week Brother Martin preached he touched on a couple things that I'll be preaching on this Sunday if
