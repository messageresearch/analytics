[10:29] now make it personal because
[10:31] [Music]
[10:55] sorry
[10:58] and my
[11:01] mind
[11:06] sometimes I could I think it's good just
[11:09] to make it personal same Lord it was for
[11:11] me
[11:12] I might look at myself and say I'm not
[11:14] worthy and no I'm not but he did it
[11:16] anyways
[11:18] and it has just as as brother Daniel was
[11:21] ministering this morning
[11:23] I'm thinking about
[11:26] the goodness of God and the goodness of
[11:29] God sometimes administers a little bit
[11:31] of
[11:33] straightening up
[11:34] and I'm glad he does
[11:37] and sometimes he just he reminds you how
[11:40] much he loves you but he does it for us
[11:42] and
[11:43] as he was saying it reminded me of a
[11:45] song and brother Jordan found the words
[11:49] to the uh to the chorus in um
[11:53] I heard this song A long time ago and
[11:56] the only part of it that I remember is
[11:57] the chorus
[11:59] and I asked such Martha and sister Lily
[12:02] and they didn't know this song the only
[12:04] one was Sister Angela said they used to
[12:06] sing it back home
[12:07] but the words make me willing to wait
[12:09] patiently
[12:11] for the answers I prayed for so long
[12:14] make me willing to listen to thee and to
[12:16] say not my will but thine be done
[12:20] make me willing to thank thee for tears
[12:23] and for the heartache that caused me to
[12:26] pray will you make me a vessel the
[12:29] master can use make me willing the rest
[12:33] of my days
[12:34] I just kept ringing over and I'd say I
[12:37] remember that song as a young man and
[12:39] that stuck with me and every once in a
[12:40] while I still sing it to him
[12:42] Lord let me be willing amen and then
[12:45] after I was just that it was count your
[12:47] blessings name them one by one so let's
[12:51] sing that get the words
[12:54] when upon life's philosophy

[17:44] Lord we

[17:48] Blessings

[17:52] that we wouldn't think would be a
[17:54] blessing
[17:55] but the end result was the purpose of it
[17:57] was to draw you closer
[17:59] to draw us closer to you Lord so that we
[18:02] would know how much you care for us Lord

[27:33] tonight take

[27:42] Lord we pray that you would be with us
[27:44] tonight
[27:45] that your Holy Spirit would be here
[27:48] Lord that we would be walking in your
[27:50] perfect will
[27:52] Lord that you deal with each soul that

[28:12] tonight
[28:13] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[28:17] amen God bless you all you can be seated
[28:22] I
[28:25] believe
[28:28] that
[28:30] Satan was not happy with our service
[28:32] this morning
[28:34] and I believe that God was happy
[28:36] I believe that he was pleased
[28:39] and um
[28:42] afterwards and reflecting about some
[28:45] things I am just grateful to God that
[28:49] that we have a Bible
[28:51] we have a message
[28:53] that we have a God that that can be
[28:56] touched a God that came down and dwelt
[28:58] Among Us
[29:00] God that loves us a God that knows us a
[29:04] God that cares about us
[29:07] I um I want to give a little testimony
[29:09] it just just thought about it
[29:12] I was
[29:15] I think I was 27 years old
[29:20] and uh
[29:22] Stephanie and I were just married
[29:25] and I had never taken communion before
[29:28] I was always afraid
[29:30] because I read in in this Bible I saw
[29:33] where if you take this unworthy that you
[29:38] are guilty
[29:40] of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[29:43] and I never wanted to be that
[29:45] as as a young man and it always it
[29:49] scared me all of those years because I
[29:52] would look on my life
[29:55] and I would see all of my sins and I
[29:59] would see all of my shortcomings and I
[30:02] would see how how many things that I
[30:04] would do wrong
[30:06] and all of those things would come to my
[30:08] mind
[30:09] especially before we take communion
[30:12] and I never take it
[30:15] and
[30:17] it was
[30:18] brother Heath it was Doug mccuse
[30:22] you all know brother mchughes I went
[30:24] fishing with him
[30:26] and we were
[30:28] forgot where we went
[30:30] um
[30:31] but we we went fishing in a
[30:34] he's talking with him the whole time
[30:37] and the subject of communion came up
[30:42] and Bill Doug was
[30:44] we were talking about it and and I he
[30:47] says well he says well do you believe in
[30:50] communion and I said yeah of course I do
[30:53] say it's in the word I said I've always
[30:55] believed in it
[30:57] and he said well
[30:59] why don't you take communion and I said
[31:01] brother Doug I said
[31:03] I am
[31:05] I'm not worthy
[31:07] to take communion
[31:10] I said I got all these sins in my life
[31:14] and brother Doug said
[31:16] he said well
[31:19] I can't remember his exact words but he
[31:21] told me that you will always do things
[31:24] wrong you always have sin in your life
[31:26] but if you're not checking up and if
[31:29] you're not doing your best to come up
[31:32] here before the Lord's table he said
[31:34] brother he says he says
[31:37] what are you here for
[31:39] and when we were we talked and I can't
[31:41] remember his exact words but brother
[31:44] Doug basically told me that I know
[31:48] that you're doing things wrong
[31:51] but you should still be coming
[31:53] to this communion table you don't want
[31:56] to do them
[31:58] and
[32:00] I think back now and me being 51 years
[32:04] old
[32:05] and being where I am now
[32:09] as a man of God and as somebody that
[32:11] that has dedicated my life
[32:14] to this word if I was living the life I
[32:18] was back when I was 25 26 years old 27
[32:21] years old no I shouldn't take communion
[32:25] but it's different for me now as I have
[32:28] progressed in the Lord
[32:30] that I if I if I backslid then no I
[32:34] shouldn't be coming to this table
[32:36] but back then
[32:38] I should have absolutely been here
[32:42] and I feel bad that I went those years
[32:45] not taking communion and should have
[32:48] been taking communion even though there
[32:51] were things in my life that that needed
[32:54] to be changed I still should have been
[32:56] here because my heart
[32:59] was wanting to serve the Lord
[33:02] and I was not
[33:05] I wasn't living a life that
[33:09] was
[33:11] full of sin like like what I'm going to
[33:13] read tonight
[33:15] my life didn't line up with what the
[33:19] Apostle Paul was saying on people that
[33:21] shouldn't be coming to the table
[33:24] I was
[33:25] a sinner saved by grace
[33:28] I was doing my best
[33:31] I was failing
[33:34] but
[33:35] I was trying
[33:38] my heart was right
[33:42] and I look at today I look at myself
[33:45] today and that would be very easy for me
[33:47] to say I shouldn't be taking communion
[33:49] because maybe I said something wrong
[33:52] before and and I or or maybe I
[33:57] I did something wrong there the devil's
[33:59] always going to throw things at us
[34:02] to say don't come to this table that's
[34:05] what he does he's going to do it but
[34:08] when we check up and when we're thinking
[34:10] about this communion table when we're
[34:12] thinking about taking these these
[34:14] ordinances the bread and the wine that
[34:16] represent the body of Christ do we have
[34:19] a part with them or are we going to not
[34:22] take it
[34:25] and you say Lord
[34:26] I'm going to do better I'm going to keep
[34:28] trying and then guess what you're going
[34:30] to fail
[34:31] and then you get back up like I said
[34:33] this morning and you keep trying and you
[34:36] keep moving and I feel like even now
[34:39] as a minister of the Gospel I look at
[34:42] all the things that that I've done wrong
[34:45] and and
[34:48] but I look back wow when I was 27 years
[34:52] old I've come a long way
[34:55] the uh the story that brother Branham
[34:57] tells about the uh
[35:00] the black sister
[35:02] that she said well
[35:05] I ain't what I want to be and I ain't
[35:07] what ought to be
[35:09] but I ain't what I used to be
[35:12] and that's how we feel in coming to this
[35:14] table uh Lord I am doing my best
[35:18] I'm trying yes
[35:21] I can stand here with these saints of
[35:25] God and I can take these ordinances
[35:29] according to your word
[35:32] even though
[35:34] I I do things wrong and I fail but I'm
[35:37] trying and the Lord will give us
[35:39] Revelation and bring us along as time
[35:42] goes on like I said 27 years old if I
[35:46] was if I if today if I had slid all the
[35:49] way back to that time
[35:51] then I'd say you know what I I shouldn't
[35:53] I shouldn't even be there
[35:56] but the Lord will continue to bring us
[36:00] towards Holiness and continue to bring
[36:03] us closer to him
[36:06] I am have a
[36:10] short message today and it's
[36:12] tonight and it's um
[36:15] it's kind of coming along after this
[36:17] morning after this morning's service
[36:20] let's turn to First Corinthians I'm
[36:22] going to go through First Corinthians
[36:23] chapter 10.
[36:25] and I didn't know this was here
[36:27] I I was I was reading this for for this
[36:31] morning's service a couple days ago
[36:33] yesterday
[36:35] and as I was reading these these
[36:37] scriptures
[36:39] that wow this is talking about communion
[36:42] even says communion
[36:44] what a tremendous
[36:47] teaching the Apostle Paul
[36:50] is teaching in this first Corinthians
[36:52] chapter 10.
[36:54] so let's just go verse by verse
[36:58] and I pray that
[37:00] the Lord will
[37:02] reveal a little bit more of his word to
[37:05] us and prepare our hearts for what we're
[37:08] going to do tonight
[37:10] First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1.
[37:13] moreover brethren
[37:15] I would not that ye should be ignorant
[37:18] how that all our fathers were under the
[37:21] cloud and passed through the sea you
[37:23] know what he's talking about
[37:25] he's talking about
[37:27] the Hebrews coming out of Egypt passing
[37:30] through the Red Sea
[37:32] and um
[37:34] and then going and then going into the
[37:37] into the wilderness
[37:41] and we're baptized unto Moses
[37:44] in the cloud and in the sea
[37:47] and did he eat did all eat the same
[37:49] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[37:52] same spiritual drink
[37:54] for they drank of that spiritual walk
[37:56] that followed them and that rock was
[38:00] Christ
[38:01] can you imagine how those if a Pharisee
[38:05] or a sadducee
[38:06] heard this drinking of that spiritual
[38:09] Rock and here is Paul saying oh and by
[38:13] the way it's the one that you killed
[38:15] he was alive way back when
[38:19] what is that is a beautiful statement
[38:23] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[38:25] that followed them and that rock was
[38:27] Christ
[38:30] Paul is doing nothing less than making
[38:32] Jesus God right here
[38:36] but with many of them God was not well
[38:39] pleased
[38:40] for they were overthrown in the
[38:42] wilderness
[38:43] you remember
[38:45] they were complaining all the problems
[38:48] that they had that popped up now these
[38:52] things were our examples
[38:55] to the intent that we should not lust
[38:57] after evil things as they also lusted
[39:02] very important
[39:03] the Apostle here is saying these things
[39:06] that that you know from the Torah
[39:09] these things are our example today
[39:14] neither be ye idolaters
[39:17] as were some of them as it is written
[39:19] the people sat down to eat and drink and
[39:22] they rose up to play now what he's
[39:23] talking about here is he's talking about
[39:25] Exodus 32 when Moses went up on Mount
[39:28] Sinai
[39:30] you know the story Moses Moses went up
[39:32] there and he was gone for a long time
[39:34] so the people started thinking hey is
[39:37] Moses ever going to come back down
[39:41] so they started talking amongst
[39:44] themselves and the sin that was in them
[39:47] the desire to sin started to come out
[39:51] and they told Aaron Moses's brother they
[39:56] said hey make us a calf make us a cat
[39:59] make us a god
[40:01] so Aaron says okay he says everybody
[40:04] take off their earrings and give them to
[40:06] me so they they all took off their
[40:09] earrings and and they gave them to Aaron
[40:10] Aaron fashioned this calf
[40:17] and they offered offerings to this calf
[40:21] instead of offering to Jehovah God
[40:25] so they placed this object of worship up
[40:29] and then they
[40:31] they uh they started making these
[40:34] offerings and these burnt offerings what
[40:37] they should have been doing to Jehovah
[40:39] they started doing to this calf
[40:43] and then
[40:45] they had this big feast
[40:48] and exodus 32 6 says that and they rose
[40:51] up to play
[40:54] that's when the Lord tells Moses he says
[40:57] go back down from the mountain because
[40:59] the people have corrupted themselves
[41:02] and God tells Moses God's looking down
[41:05] and he sees he says they're just sinning
[41:08] what we would call immoral Behavior
[41:11] living unclean sexually and and and and
[41:16] drinking and partying and doing doing
[41:18] exactly
[41:20] what God just despised
[41:24] remember
[41:25] Paul here is getting to the communion
[41:27] table
[41:28] and he's saying use this as an example
[41:33] God tells Moses he says these are a
[41:35] stiff-neck people and I'm going to
[41:37] consume them all
[41:40] and Moses cries out to Jehovah
[41:44] and he says Lord why are you so angry
[41:46] with your people
[41:48] that you brought out of Egypt
[41:51] we know that that is sister Shirley
[41:54] that's that sweet Spirit of Christ
[41:56] that's operating in God's prophets
[41:59] standing in the breach before an Angry
[42:03] wrathful God
[42:05] and those that deserve the Wrath on the
[42:09] on the bottom there and then here we
[42:12] have that Spirit of Christ in Moses
[42:15] saying Lord wait
[42:17] Lord wait you called these people out
[42:21] you brought them out and now
[42:25] you brought them into this Wilderness
[42:28] with a mighty hand
[42:30] and now all the Egyptians are going to
[42:32] say that you brought them out just to
[42:33] kill him in the wilderness
[42:35] he said Lord he said the King James says
[42:39] Lord this is a strange thing or someone
[42:43] to say but the King James says Moses
[42:46] said Lord repent
[42:48] of what you're going to do to these
[42:50] people that word repent means to to
[42:55] um reverse to come back
[42:58] so
[43:00] God listened to his servant Prophet
[43:03] Moses
[43:04] and he said
[43:06] okay
[43:08] and it says in the Lord
[43:10] the Lord repented the Lord stepped back
[43:12] from what he was going to do
[43:15] from his intention
[43:18] to destroy the people
[43:22] verse number eight in First Corinthians
[43:25] so
[43:27] we're looking now at these people these
[43:30] revelers these people that wanted to sin
[43:34] like I said out partying and drinking
[43:37] and and living unclean living immorally
[43:42] Paul says this neither let us commit
[43:44] fornication as as some of them committed
[43:47] and fell in one day three and twenty
[43:51] thousand he's talking about their sins
[43:52] over those 40 years in the wilderness
[43:55] neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[43:58] them also tempted and were destroyed of
[44:00] serpents now he's talking about when
[44:03] they were in the wilderness that these
[44:04] these poisonous snakes were out there
[44:07] they started they started getting bitten
[44:09] by these snakes and and the people they
[44:11] started dying and then remember Moses
[44:14] raised up the brass serpent
[44:16] and he said look on this when you get
[44:20] bitten by one of these snakes and you'll
[44:22] live
[44:24] verse 10 neither murmur ye
[44:27] as some of them also murmured and were
[44:29] destroyed of the Destroyer
[44:32] murmuring complaining right up there
[44:36] with fornication and adultery
[44:41] speaking of their complaining
[44:45] God brings them through the Red Sea
[44:48] and then they start complaining how they
[44:50] were going to die in the wilderness for
[44:51] star from starvation God starts raining
[44:53] down Manna From Heaven then they start
[44:56] complaining that they don't have enough
[44:57] water
[44:58] then God brings water out of the Rock
[45:02] which was Christ
[45:04] then God brings water out of the rock
[45:06] they drink oh and we don't like Manna
[45:08] anymore we want some meat so then he
[45:10] sends them quail
[45:11] continues to give them what they what
[45:14] they asked for and yet they continued to
[45:17] complain
[45:20] and the whole time fighting amongst
[45:22] themselves having to go to Moses so
[45:24] where Moses had to set um
[45:26] I think it was 70. underneath them to
[45:28] take care of all the problems and all
[45:30] the conflicts that they had
[45:36] verse number 11 now all these things
[45:39] happened unto them for examples
[45:42] and they are written for our admonition
[45:45] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[45:48] again Paul is saying here these things
[45:51] are examples to us look before you take
[45:53] this communion look at what they did in
[45:56] the wilderness look at all the sin
[45:59] so we don't fall into the same
[46:01] Temptations and make the same mistakes
[46:02] as they made
[46:04] wherefore let him that thinketh
[46:07] he standeth take heed lest he fall
[46:10] there has no temptation taken you
[46:13] but such is as is common to man
[46:17] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[46:19] you to be tempted above that you're able
[46:21] but will with the temptation
[46:24] also make a way of Escape
[46:27] that you may be able to bear it
[46:29] I spoke about that this morning how
[46:31] nothing's new all these temptations that
[46:33] we have all these problems that we have
[46:35] other people have had them
[46:38] and yes you can overcome these things
[46:43] wherefore my dearly beloved
[46:46] flee from idolatry
[46:48] now you have to think of Paul's audience
[46:51] here
[46:52] these are Jews and Gentiles that have
[46:56] have accepted the Lord Jesus just like
[46:58] us
[47:00] he's speaking to the conservative
[47:02] audience and he's speaking to the
[47:04] liberal audience
[47:06] and he says that these Christians
[47:08] these people that are Christians some of
[47:10] them some of them are probably new most
[47:13] likely are new converts but then there's
[47:16] some there that had been there for a
[47:18] while and that were well learned and
[47:22] understood these things and we're living
[47:24] this life
[47:26] that that was more above reproach than
[47:30] the others he's he's looking at this
[47:32] Corinthian Church and you see the whole
[47:33] spectrum of people
[47:38] he says this
[47:41] after he says flee from idolatry he says
[47:44] I speak as to wise men
[47:47] judge ye what I say
[47:51] I've heard
[47:52] some people say that that
[47:55] anyone who's standing in the pulpits
[47:57] anointed I would I would beg to differ
[47:59] with that
[48:01] you judge everything I say
[48:05] when I say it don't just think it's
[48:07] anointed because I'm standing behind a
[48:09] wooden box
[48:12] when I am ministering it's got to line
[48:15] up with the word through the Holy Spirit
[48:21] as I said it doesn't matter who's
[48:22] standing here and it doesn't matter just
[48:24] because I'm speaking to a to a church
[48:28] that doesn't mean that I'm right
[48:31] it doesn't mean that I can't make
[48:32] mistakes you judge what I say
[48:38] I'll do my best and I seek the Lord for
[48:41] these things and and I'm I'm trying
[48:44] but Paul right here says
[48:47] I speak as the wise men judge ye what I
[48:50] say
[48:51] this is the Apostle speaking so how much
[48:54] how much less how much more should I say
[48:56] that
[48:59] now this next verse
[49:01] shows us communion
[49:04] the cup of the blessing
[49:06] which we bless is it not the communion
[49:09] of the blood of Christ
[49:11] the bread which we break is it not the
[49:13] communion of the body of Christ
[49:17] showing that that the blood the the wine
[49:20] that we we take represents the blood of
[49:23] Jesus Christ the the bread
[49:26] represents that torn broken body of
[49:31] Christ
[49:34] for we being many are one bread and one
[49:39] body
[49:40] for we are all partakers of that one
[49:42] bread
[49:43] now remember when Jesus in his last
[49:46] supper
[49:48] he tells us to wash each other's feet
[49:52] he uh he tells the disciples he says
[49:55] that
[49:56] he said I can only imagine and and as we
[49:59] as we take these ordinances tonight
[50:03] we do
[50:05] reenact what happened
[50:07] there at that faithful night that last
[50:10] supper when Jesus the next morning was
[50:13] going to be on the cross
[50:16] and so Jesus is is there with his
[50:19] disciples and
[50:20] he's teaching them and he's he's talking
[50:23] he he brings the disciples in he kneels
[50:27] down and he takes a basin and he washes
[50:30] their feet
[50:31] girds himself with a towel and and
[50:34] dries their feet off and he does it to
[50:36] each one and and then they they sit down
[50:41] for supper and Jesus says that one of
[50:46] you is going to betray me
[50:49] you know those disciples we know what
[50:51] they said
[50:52] they said like we would probably say
[50:55] Lord I hope it's not me
[50:58] and maybe they were thinking just like I
[51:01] was as a young man well I've done this
[51:03] and I've done this and I've done this
[51:05] and I'm not worthy well we're not worthy
[51:09] but
[51:10] we're still commanded to be here
[51:15] so much so
[51:17] that the disciples start saying Lord is
[51:20] it me
[51:21] Lord is it me
[51:23] so then we have
[51:26] this young man John
[51:29] who's leaning
[51:31] on the Lord Jesus's chest Peter says
[51:40] John
[51:43] says uh
[51:45] Lord
[51:47] who is it
[51:50] the Lord Jesus says the same one when I
[51:55] dip this bread in the SOP who I give it
[51:59] to is that one
[52:01] dipped it
[52:02] and he gave it to the Man Judas is
[52:05] carrot
[52:06] and he says go do
[52:08] what you have to do
[52:10] Judas
[52:12] up
[52:14] and he leaves and none of them
[52:15] understood it
[52:17] even though he said it they still didn't
[52:19] get it they're like oh Judas he's the
[52:22] treasurer so he's probably going to give
[52:23] money to the poor or or go do something
[52:25] so out he goes and now we have our
[52:30] communion service and here is Jesus and
[52:33] he's breaking this bread for the
[52:35] disciples
[52:38] and
[52:40] he he says this let me let's turn to
[52:42] John chapter 13. I don't have it written
[52:45] down here but I want to read it
[52:48] John Chapter 13 Verse 31.
[52:51] this is at
[52:53] The Last Supper
[52:58] John 13.
[53:01] 31.
[53:03] therefore when he was gone out
[53:07] about Judas
[53:09] I'll start with 29. for some of them
[53:11] have thought because Judas had the bag
[53:13] that Jesus had said unto him by those
[53:15] things
[53:16] that we have need of against the feast
[53:19] or that he should give something to the
[53:21] poor
[53:22] and then
[53:23] having received the SOP went immediately
[53:26] out and it was night therefore when he
[53:29] was gone out Jesus said now
[53:32] is the son of man glorified and God is
[53:35] glorified in him
[53:38] if God be glorified in him God shall
[53:41] also glorify him in himself
[53:44] and shall straightway glorify him
[53:48] little children
[53:50] can imagine
[53:52] these are his friends
[53:55] these are the people that he loves more
[54:00] these are the ones that are closest to
[54:03] him I shouldn't say I don't know if he
[54:04] loved them more than anybody else
[54:06] because he died for all of us he died
[54:08] for me
[54:10] and I'm here 2000 years later
[54:13] but these were his disciples those that
[54:18] just stuck with him
[54:21] he says this
[54:26] little children
[54:29] yet
[54:30] a little while
[54:33] I am with you
[54:34] you shall seek me and I said unto the
[54:37] Jews whether I go you cannot come so now
[54:41] I say
[54:42] a new commandment
[54:46] commandment means he commands it
[54:51] a new commandment I give unto you
[54:55] that you love one another as I have
[54:57] loved you that ye also love one another
[55:02] so as much as I have loved you
[55:04] I want you to love each other
[55:10] by this the famous scripture that's
[55:13] quoted so often but how many people put
[55:15] it into practice
[55:17] by this shall all men know that you are
[55:20] my disciples if you have loved one for
[55:25] another
[55:28] so
[55:30] I'll know you
[55:33] not because you're fighting about
[55:35] doctrines not because you're you're
[55:37] cutting people out of communion or
[55:39] you're allowing this one to take
[55:41] communion or you're trying to enforce
[55:44] something but the way I'll know you is
[55:46] because you love one another
[55:50] let's go back to First Corinthians 10.
[55:54] verse 18.
[55:56] behold Israel after the flesh
[56:01] are not they which eat of the sacrifices
[56:03] partakers of the altar what say I then
[56:07] that the idol is anything or that which
[56:10] is offered in sacrifice to Idols is
[56:13] anything but I say that the things which
[56:15] the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to
[56:19] devils and not to God
[56:21] and I would not that ye should have
[56:24] fellowship with devils
[56:27] you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and
[56:30] the cup of devils you cannot be
[56:32] partakers of the Lord's table and the
[56:34] table of devils remember what I was
[56:37] saying about them in the wilderness
[56:40] and how they were acting and how Paul
[56:42] here was saying remember the calf and
[56:44] what they did and and their unclean
[56:46] living and sleeping around and drinking
[56:48] and doing all this
[56:53] and you want to bring that
[56:56] to the communion table
[56:59] you're going to eat you're going to be
[57:01] out there living a double life eating
[57:04] and drinking with the world and then
[57:06] you're gonna come in here
[57:10] and eat and drink with the Saints
[57:16] Paul just went through all of these sins
[57:20] complaining idolatry sexual immorality
[57:23] and all the other sins they were
[57:24] committing in the wilderness
[57:26] and he says that you cannot be living a
[57:29] double life
[57:31] if you are coming to this communion
[57:33] table
[57:35] that's the key
[57:37] you can't be living the double life what
[57:39] you are today
[57:42] in this church
[57:44] should be what you are tomorrow
[57:48] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and
[57:50] Saturday
[57:52] you can't be living on a sinful life
[57:55] outside
[57:56] different and then come here and try to
[57:59] be a saint
[58:03] verse number 20 let's skip to Let's skip
[58:05] for time's sake let's skip to verse 31.
[58:10] whether therefore ye eat or drink
[58:14] or whatsoever you do
[58:17] all to the glory of God do you like that
[58:20] scripture I like that one I'm gonna read
[58:23] it again
[58:24] whether therefore ye eat or drink we're
[58:27] going to be doing both tonight
[58:29] or whatever you do do all to the glory
[58:33] of God
[58:34] give none offense he neither to the Jews
[58:38] nor to the Gentiles nor to the Church of
[58:40] God
[58:42] even as I please all men in all things
[58:46] not seeking mine own prophet
[58:49] but the prophet of many
[58:52] I seek Paul as saying here it's a little
[58:55] hard to understand Paul is saying here
[58:57] that I'm not seeking this for myself I
[59:01] am preferring you over me
[59:05] is what Paul is saying
[59:08] even as I please all men in all things
[59:11] not seeking my own Prophet but the
[59:15] prophet of many that they may be saved
[59:22] I I have to admit
[59:24] that this first Corinthians chapter 10
[59:29] I didn't see the significance of the
[59:32] communion table even though it's as
[59:34] obvious as you can be
[59:37] he's talking about the communion and
[59:40] he's saying look at all of these sins
[59:42] that happened out there in the
[59:44] wilderness
[59:45] complaining
[59:47] was a big one
[59:49] immorality was another one
[59:53] and you can't do that
[59:57] and also call yourself a Christian and
[1:00:01] come to this table how can you eat at
[1:00:03] the table of devils which is when they
[1:00:06] built the calf
[1:00:07] worshiping that and eat the at the table
[1:00:10] of God which is the table we're going to
[1:00:12] come to tonight
[1:00:13] you can't
[1:00:15] and that's why it's so important for us
[1:00:18] to examine ourselves
[1:00:21] to make sure that I'm not just a Sunday
[1:00:23] Christian
[1:00:24] then I believe this with all of my heart
[1:00:27] I want to live this I want to serve God
[1:00:31] lord I want to do what you want me to do
[1:00:36] this is a question between
[1:00:40] you and God
[1:00:42] between me and God it says let a man
[1:00:46] examine himself
[1:00:49] brother Jeremy it doesn't say
[1:00:51] let brother Daniel examine brother
[1:00:53] Jeremy
[1:00:54] it's not what it's saying this is you
[1:00:58] and God
[1:01:00] this is each one here
[1:01:03] and the Lord you are making this
[1:01:06] decision saying Lord I know as I said as
[1:01:09] a Young Man Lord I know
[1:01:12] then I'm not worthy
[1:01:14] but I also know in my heart
[1:01:18] that I am a Christian
[1:01:20] that I do my best to live this gospel to
[1:01:24] the best that I know how
[1:01:27] and as I said before
[1:01:29] as a 27 year old man and as a 51 year
[1:01:33] old man there's a big difference
[1:01:35] in my life I was living a good life back
[1:01:37] then I wasn't I wasn't sinning and doing
[1:01:39] so many things that the world
[1:01:43] um does
[1:01:45] but I wasn't the place where I am now
[1:01:49] and we always need
[1:01:51] to be ready
[1:01:53] and I think that
[1:01:55] I know
[1:01:57] that Jesus will soon have another supper
[1:02:03] let me just talk about it for a minute
[1:02:05] I just I just think
[1:02:10] he
[1:02:12] is going to have a wedding supper he
[1:02:16] said he says this is the last time
[1:02:19] he says I'm breaking this he says you're
[1:02:22] not going to do it with me anymore until

[1:04:05] and this is my my seat
[1:04:08] I made it oh Lord Jesus thank you
[1:04:15] I wanna I Wanna Be There
[1:04:19] Let's Make Ready brethren for the
[1:04:21] communion service
[1:04:24] let's
[1:04:27] let's take
[1:04:30] two or three minutes
[1:04:32] of quiet meditation
[1:04:35] to think about what happened that day 2
[1:04:39] 000 years ago what happened in that last
[1:04:40] supper
[1:04:41] what this means
[1:04:44] this time that we have what it means to
[1:04:47] you and me
[1:04:51] ask the Lord in your own way
[1:04:55] any sin
[1:04:57] that might be separating you
[1:05:01] from the Lord Jesus
[1:05:03] ask him to take it away
[1:05:06] repent
[1:05:07] of it
[1:05:10] I am said this morning that
[1:05:14] that says
[1:05:16] in this last stage in Revelation chapter
[1:05:19] 3 it says be zealous therefore and
[1:05:22] repent amen
[1:05:24] the repentance is there too
[1:05:26] there's so little repentance in the
[1:05:28] world
[1:05:29] but as as we get quiet before the Lord
[1:05:32] and
[1:05:34] and the brothers get ready let's just
[1:05:36] take
[1:05:38] just a couple minutes I think it'd be
[1:05:40] well worth our time
[1:05:42] quiet meditation before the Lord
[1:06:33] foreign
[1:07:19] Lord we love you
[1:07:21] First Corinthians
[1:07:23] chapter 11.
[1:07:26] verse 23.
[1:07:32] it's so beautiful the very next
[1:07:35] chapter
[1:07:37] the one I just read
[1:07:40] makes sense
[1:07:45] for I have received of the Lord
[1:07:48] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:07:50] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:07:52] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:07:57] and when he had given thanks
[1:07:59] he break it
[1:08:01] and said take eat
[1:08:04] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:08:07] do this in remembrance of me
[1:08:11] after the same manner also he took the
[1:08:14] cup
[1:08:16] when he had sucked saying this cup is
[1:08:19] the New Testament in my blood
[1:08:22] this do ye as often as ye drink it in
[1:08:26] remembrance of me
[1:08:30] for as often as you take as often as you
[1:08:33] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:08:37] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:08:41] wherefore
[1:08:42] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:08:45] this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:08:47] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:08:50] blood of the Lord
[1:08:54] but let a man examine himself
[1:08:58] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:09:00] drink of that cup
[1:09:02] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:09:04] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:09:07] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:09:11] body
[1:09:12] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:09:16] among you
[1:09:17] and many sleep
[1:09:20] for if we would judge ourselves
[1:09:24] we should not be judged
[1:09:27] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:09:30] of the Lord
[1:09:32] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:09:36] world
[1:09:37] amen Brothers if you come forward
[1:09:40] for the ordinances sister Martha are you
[1:09:43] playing or sister Lily could you come
[1:10:08] this bread
[1:10:11] and it's broken into little pieces
[1:10:16] it's it's broken and it's torn
[1:10:19] and it represents
[1:10:21] the body of our Lord Jesus
[1:10:27] as you take this
[1:10:29] bread remember
[1:10:32] every piece is different
[1:10:36] and
[1:10:38] this bread is not the body we're not
[1:10:40] Catholic but it represents the body
[1:10:45] Heavenly Father
[1:10:48] as I hold this bread
[1:10:51] knowing Lord that it represents
[1:10:56] body of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:11:02] Lord may your anointing be with us as we
[1:11:06] take this in remembrance
[1:11:08] of the Lord
[1:11:12] and Lord may your blessings
[1:11:14] be upon this bread
[1:11:16] as we take it and we consume it
[1:11:21] as was commanded
[1:11:22] by our Lord and savior
[1:11:25] Jesus name
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:34] it's wine
[1:11:39] represents the blood of our Lord and
[1:11:42] savior
[1:11:46] it has so many times we see that
[1:11:49] different faiths May
[1:11:53] take grape juice
[1:11:55] or they may take water or something else
[1:11:58] but this wine
[1:12:02] active
[1:12:03] it has spirit
[1:12:05] inside of it
[1:12:09] God the Lord told us to drink the wine
[1:12:14] in remembrance of him
[1:12:16] and to think that this wine that I look
[1:12:20] on right now
[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:23] represents it's red and it represents
[1:12:27] the blood that was shed on the cross
[1:12:31] that was spilled down his body
[1:12:35] and went out on the ground
[1:12:38] the blood of the one man that had never
[1:12:42] sinned
[1:12:43] the blood of our Lord and our Savior
[1:12:45] Jesus Christ
[1:12:48] father
[1:12:49] [Music]
[1:12:51] I hold this wine in my hands
[1:12:55] representing the blood of our savior
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:12:59] Lord as it comes to our lips and we
[1:13:03] drink Lord May our minds go back to
[1:13:06] Calvary
[1:13:08] Lord we do this in obedience to your
[1:13:13] word to us
[1:13:15] Jesus Christ's name we pray father may
[1:13:19] your blessings be upon this wine
[1:13:26] the ordinances thank you

[1:22:48] and supper being ended
[1:22:51] the devil
[1:22:52] having now put into the heart of judas's
[1:22:55] caring
[1:22:56] Simon's son
[1:22:58] to betray him
[1:23:00] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:23:02] all things into his hand and that he was
[1:23:04] come from God and went to God he rises
[1:23:08] from supper and laid aside his garments
[1:23:11] and took a towel and girded himself
[1:23:14] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:23:16] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:23:20] to wipe them with a towel wherewith he
[1:23:22] was girded then cometh thee to Simon
[1:23:26] Peter
[1:23:28] and Peter saith unto him
[1:23:30] Lord thus thou wash my feet
[1:23:34] Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:23:37] what I do
[1:23:39] thou knowest not now
[1:23:42] but Thou shalt know hereafter
[1:23:45] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[1:23:47] wash my feet
[1:23:49] Jesus answered him
[1:23:51] if I wash thee not thou Hast no part
[1:23:54] with me
[1:23:57] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my
[1:24:00] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:24:03] Jesus saith and saith to him
[1:24:06] he that is washed needeth not saved to
[1:24:11] wash his feet but is clean every wit and
[1:24:14] you're clean but not all
[1:24:17] for he knew who should betray him
[1:24:20] therefore he said ye are not all clean
[1:24:24] so after
[1:24:26] he had washed their feet and had taken
[1:24:28] his garments and was set down again he
[1:24:31] said unto them know ye what I have done
[1:24:34] to you
[1:24:37] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:24:40] well for so I am
[1:24:43] if then your Lord and Master have washed
[1:24:46] your feet
[1:24:47] ye also
[1:24:49] ought to wash one another's feet
[1:24:52] for I have given you an example that you
[1:24:55] should do as I have done to you
[1:24:59] to you verily verily I say unto you
[1:25:01] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[1:25:04] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:25:07] that sent him
[1:25:09] if ye know these things
[1:25:11] happy are ye if
[1:25:18] men or the wrong Glide why would you
[1:25:20] come up and close my brother
[1:25:22] the men will go upstairs

[1:26:40] such a small thing that we've about
[1:26:42] ourselves before our brothers and
