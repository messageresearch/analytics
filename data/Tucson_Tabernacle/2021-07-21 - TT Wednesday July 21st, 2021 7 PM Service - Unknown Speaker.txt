believe [Music] god bless you this evening you may be seated as we start this sermon okay good evening to houston i certainly deem this the great privilege of being here again tonight in houston it's been many years since i've had the privilege of being here and i've been setting listening tonight to each of these speakers and the other day when i had arrangements made for something else another place and i knew that those children were facing death i thought if something would happen to those children i would never forgive myself of not coming here to give my opinion and doing all that i could help this uh mother and father and of these children and to do all that i could for the saving of their lives and houston has is a memorial place to me it holds many great memories that i have cherished ever since i first made my visit here many years ago over here to the herald of faith brother kidson and then down here to the auditorium when i was here with brother raymond richie and the ministers of the city and then of course mr iris mr kipperman the night that the camera proved that i wasn't telling anything that was wrong it was truth and when the mechanical eye of the camera caught the vision of the or not the vision the reality the christ that we preached and so loved was with us that he promised to be with us and the camera tuck his picture many times i said in times past that that i'd see that light all the time but sometimes people would be a little skeptic of it which you could believe they could be that way but that night it proved it that was the first time it was ever taken since then it's been taken several times in germany just recently coming down when the anointing was when it went back again and those things are not to magnify some human being but it's the vindicate the presence of jesus christ among these people and we believe that that same lord jesus is here tonight to help us in this case and i believe that he's more interested in it than we could be and i am certainly in sympathy with the parents of these children and shoulder-to-shoulder with every man and woman that's trying to deliver them from the jaws of death and now i understand that this is not a revival meeting but it's just a series of prayer meetings being held for these souls that's laying in the shadows of death and so i am late i will not speak very long but i would like to draw a text or context whether from a text that i would like to read in two places in the scripture and you who have the bibles if you would turn with me for just a moment to the book of philippians the first chapter and the 20th verse of the first chapter of philippians according to my earnest expectations and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but with all boldness as always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be life or death and then in also in the book of acts the second chapter and the 30th verse i might read the 25th through the 30th for david spake concerning him for i'll foresaw the lord always before my faith for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because i will not leave my soul in hell neither will i suffer thy holy one to see corruption thou has made known to me the way of life thou shall make me full of joy with thy countenances men and brethren let me freely speak to you the patriarch david that he's both dead and buried and his sepulcher is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to set on his throne he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither did his flesh seek corruption let us bow our heads just a moment for prayer our heavenly father we are grateful to thee for our mercy and that's truly lord why we are here tonight is to ask mercy we would not ask this if we did not have faith to believe that it would be granted to us man has flown across the country and prayers are going up everywhere to thee that the lives of these that we are earnestly interceding for tonight may be spare lord we would ask for strength for the mothers and fathers of these young people and as we understand that this young man has turned his life to thee and wants to serve the as we heard one of the speakers say that he wanted to become a minister of the gospel i pray god that you will grant this opportunity to the young fellow forgive us of our sins cleanse our hearts from evil thoughts and whatever would be in our way that would hinder our prayer from being answered for these people as we have read thy word we know both heavens and earth will pass away but thy word shall not fail we pray that you will add to us by the holy spirit the context that would take that would be your divine will in this case now as we've heard the attorney and many speaking and we pray that we will find just what to do next what is our next step to do lord we are here to do it make it known to us lord through thy word for we asked it in the name of thy son the lord jesus amen reading these few verses and i'll realize the occasion is great because it's concerned i would think when i heard and got that mother's telegram what if that was my son sitting in that role or my daughter and i we want to put everything that we can to it then some might say well that was just a very small portion of the word that you read brother branham well that may be true too but you see it isn't the the size or the amount of words it's what it means it's it's just what it is it's the promise of god and i want to draw from this night from this text tonight or a text from this uh absolute now i've chosen this text a while ago sitting in my motel room because i think that now we need something positive some absolute that we can hold on to and know that it's true crucial hour like this we must have something that we are positive that's right something that we can hold to to know whether uh how the case is going now according to to webster uh absolute in itself is unlimited in power and primarily is an ultimate and an ultimate is an amen it's the absolute as what if that's the end that's everything now every great achievement that's ever been in the world has been tied to some sort of an absolute you cannot do anything unless there's something that you can hold to when a young man is going to get married to a young woman he must know the character of this young woman or the young woman must know the character of the young man something that she can hold to will this man be a just man will he make me the right type of husband will this woman give to me in life what i what i expect out of her loyalty and so forth and then it's got to be somewhere that they can base their their vows upon knowing that there's something that will hold and that's the reason we bring them to the church and to the word of god to get this absolute uh tide now paul here as we see he had an absolute that he held to all his life after his conversion that was a christ-centered life and what a place to have an absolute a christ-centered life it was a different life than what he had lived at one time for he said the life that i now live which was a different from what he had lived there come a time that paul had this experience that brought him to this decision for paul was a great mighty man amongst the jews and a great theologian but he wasn't too sure of his standing but one day on the road down to damascus a light pillar of fire came down from heaven and paul being a jew was acquainted that this light pillar of fire had been the thing that had the god that had led his people out of egypt they had followed this pillar of fire so being a jew he said to him quickly lord who art thou he knew him as lord but who art thou and the voice came back from the pillar of fire i am jesus and it's hard for you to kick against the pricks from that time on paul knew that the jehovah of the old testament was jesus of the new and he had something that he could hold to and that's how you could write that great book of hebrews now if you if in your life you have an absolute you do things ordinarily you would not do especially if you have a god-centered life the god-centered life makes the person do things that ordinarily they would not do very odd peculiar why is a christian life so odd and peculiar it's because that they are looking to god's word which is almost foreign to the world today now we have churches and we have organizations and we have religion all much of it around the world am i seven times around since i was here with you at houston i've accumulated much knowledge on the gods and the religions of this world but that isn't what i'm talking about i'm talking about an absolute connected with christ then it makes you a a odd person you do odd things your thinking is all together different than the thinking you once did because you have found something that you've anchored a faith in someone that created the heavens and the earth that his very word itself is creative a god who spoke the world into existence and there's nothing too hard for him so it makes you a creative yourself because you take his words and a word is a thought expressed now paul had got into that state to where that he had had not a theological experience altogether but he had a personal witness he had met god and knew that he was called of god and nobody had to tell him anything about it he was absolutely hopes but our our positive thought upon what he says and we know that it is the truth and people act funny they seem to just forget about the negative side because they have found an absolute because it's the word of god jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail so if we've got the word of promise then there's no failing to it it cannot fail so i i'm believing that that's what the prayer meetings here the the religious people of houston are interested in human lives and that's what we are gathered here for is to is to call on a power that's beyond all man-made laws and powers something who can change the hearts of man like he did pharaoh in egypt and he's he's god and we must stop now looking at the the negative side and go to looking at the positive side and before you can have faith you've got to have something to have faith in and what more can you trust faith in than it can the word of the living god what's created the powers what more could we put our hopes in therefore it makes you look different act different you are looking for god to fulfill his promise and when difficulties arise like we have now it is an anchor it's something that that holds you something that you're tied to it's a promise that we have been tied to the word of god is just like the anchor is the absolute to the ship in the time of storm the ship can be sailing the sea the anchor is out in the front it's it rests you people here in houston so close to the sea see the ships come in and why i carry this excess weight of this great mighty anchor but you see when the storms come the the raging storms that rips up the sea and control the vessel into the bank somewhere and crash it or turn it over in the shallow waters it gets out into the deep waters and lets down this great huge anchor that's so fixed that it'll drag on the bottom of the sea and until it hooks into the top of some unseen mountain then let the storms rage if they want to it's got an absolute the anchor hole some worry on earth but it's it's tight and as the ship and the waves whip around the ship it's got an absolute because it's tied that's the way that a man is when he's tied to christ into his word and believes it there's an absolute there's something that holds him an absolute is like the north star when you're lost when you when you've lost your directions and you want to find your way back the north star is an absolute now these other stars but they turn with the world as the world turns around them the it turns away from them and the you know the same morning star is the evening star also because the world's just turned around but there's one star that does not move and it's centered right in the middle of the earth and therefore the it's a it's a sure star if you know the north star you can always find your way around but oh that's when a man's lost and he doesn't know just which way to go now i know a star oh it's more than a north star and to be tied and see his presence no matter how you're lost or where you are you can find your way back but his guidance that's his word it's the way out of all troubles it's the way to peace it's the way to success it's a way to life itself is to follow this star the lord jesus and now if you are tied to that star the holy spirit is a compass that will only point to the star the holy compass it is magnetized to that north pole and the only way no matter how much jungler you're in or how deep the thickets are around you how foggy it is to see that compass hand you can turn it any way you want to and it'll swing right back and point to the north star and when we're in trouble and trust in christ there's one thing sure the holy spirit will point us to the word that will guide us to the north star into the deliverance of everything we have in edom he is our absolute to the man that's lost in the wilderness the compass is the thing that guides him to the outward when we are in trouble there's only one thing it's just as sure as in our star as long as the world stands in his position and turns around the north star will remain in his place and long as there is an eternity christ will ever be the savior in a way out of every problem ever just every trial ever the thing and therefore we we when we are tied to him we don't get flustered and all worked up like the world does and all what will we do about this what will we do about that we seem as if we're not even anchored but a man who's anchored his soul into christ jesus his trust there knowing that when he asks the father anything in his name jesus said i'll do it that settles it that settles it it's the amen it's the absolute it's the ultimate when jesus said ask the father anything in my name i'll grant it now that's an ultimate that's it whatever you have need of when you pray believe that you receive it you shall have it that settles it that's all of it see if we're really anchored and believe it and we've made him our absolute of course he does he is the absolute that takes us from all fear there's no fear when you are really tied to the rock of ages there's no fear to the sailor how hard the ships are being buffeted by the waves as long as that anchor's holding in the top of the mountain down there well sure he knows the ship's going to stay up it isn't going against some rock somewhere it isn't going to get in some shallow water and be turned over because it's got the absolute anchored in the top of some mountain and when a man can pray the prayer of faith and anchor his soul you honor in the word of god where all heavens and earth will pass away for that word cannot there is no fear let them come say whatever they want to our faith is in god god alone we believe it there was a time that when the table manners of this nation rested upon the word of a woman i believe her name was called emily post now she was the absolute to table manners if emily poe said take and eat your beans with your knife that was it that was it because she was the absolute for table manners as she said drink your coffee out of your saucer and sup it as you did no matter how sloppy it sound it was still the absolute everybody bowed to it because they've taken her to be the absolute of table manners we've got to have an absolute no matter what we're doing if we're ever going to achieve anything we've got to have an absolute there was a time when hitler's word was an absolute in germany no matter what anybody else said hitler's word was an absolute if he said they die they die if he said they live they live and if he said we go to war we do not go to war whatever we do his word was an absolute there was a time that when italy had an absolute that was a word of their dictator mussolinia what he said do they said his chauffeur drove up one minute early to get him he shot him wow he said i don't want you here one minute early i want you here on the dock exactly time see his word was absolute all italy bowed to it there was a time when pharaoh in egypt was an absolute but you see but all these decisions that they made were man's made decision and they all fell why because they were not in accordance with human it wasn't accordance with god's word for human life i want that i hope to anchor if we expect to save human life we've got to come in accordance with god's word and god's plan for human life and the only way you're going to find this is to find it in his word and believe it now so them pharaohs i was in egypt not long ago and i think they had to dig 20 feet down in the ground to find the the place where pharaoh was seated as a king of the earth and great herod's and so forth passing down along the line we see where their kingdoms has fallen and gone on but there is one kingdom that's above all kingdoms it's so high to the heavens so he'll never pass away there sets a king that when he makes his decision on anything and we believe that decision that is an absolute it's going to be that way regardless of what anyone else says about it it's always now our supreme court our supreme court it is an absolute the end of all the trials now we have to have it sometime we might not agree with this decision like they didn't agree with hitler's and so forth but yet we've got to have this absolute and the absolute of the nation and trials is a supreme court our local courts can try anything and pronounce this but the supreme court rules over it all we must have it as a nation we must have its decision because a nation is tied to this absolute of the supreme court all right everything must have an absolute did you know a common ball game has to have an absolute how what is the absolute of a ball game an umpire what if there is no empire see a umpire no matter where you're standing what position you look at and you say it was a ball and he said it was a strike well that's what it was it was a strike why because his word no matter what the bleacher said what somebody else said it's a strike because he called it a strike and he's the empire now what if there was no umpire there'd be such a fuss and everything in chaos until you couldn't have the ball game therefore you've got to have a absolute to have a ball game it must be that way now there must be a an absolute in a traffic light a traffic light is an absolute rather to traffic what if there was no traffic light or what if the traffic light was out and you run down the street and one fellow was coming this way and he said i was here first i've got to get through that and said i'm late for work talk about a traffic jam you'd really have it but see the traffic light settles it's the absolute if the light is green go if it's red stop if there is no such a thing as a traffic light then we'd have traffic jams and that's what's the matter in the christian faith today we got too many traffic jams everybody making their own absolute when we got one absolute and that's the word of the living god that settles it forever no matter what anyone else says it's almost gotten to a place like it was in the days of judges everybody has their own absolute but it all fails like the pharaohs and so forth but god's absolute is his word he gives it and heavens and earth will pass away but it shall never pass away i like that now we haven't got much time so just just look for a few moments to a few people that did come into crisis and of times where death was at hand like we are standing tonight and they took an absolute let's interview some of them let's go back to an old story that's familiar to all of us in the days when sin had heaped into the world to god got sick and tired of it and the world was going to be destroyed and god gave noah an absolute that was his word and it no matter that absolute was of the saving of the people noah knew that the world was going to die and god gave him the absolute and that was his word now to save his people from death now what was the absolute to save people from death and noah's time was the word of god that was the absolute no matter what anybody else said what science said there's no rain up there we can shoot the moon with our instruments there's no rain there how's rain going to come down if god said that there would be rainfall god can put rain in the skies if he said so noah went right about his business relaxed and preparing an ark for the saving of the people for there was an absolute given to the people that they would be saved if they took god's provided way for this absolute so after sometimes when we've accepted the absolute i would like to say this because of the parent of these children of what i want to tell you just in a moment now if uh sometimes when we have accepted it we are put to trial to see if we really believe it we god usually does that and god works uh he cannot change his program because his word is himself in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever so it's always god when he's called upon a scene to act and the decision that he makes he has to ever remain with that decision he cannot change it because he's infinite now i can change my decision you can because we're finite therefore we make mistakes but god cannot change his decision because he's infinite and his his decision is perfect always he cannot say i was wrong here and i'll change my decision because that was sure god could change and god cannot change neither can his word change he's the same always so god gave noah trial after accepting his absolute noah went into the ark god shut the door behind him no doubt they said now in the morning there'll be black clouds and there'll be thunder and lightning and the rains will fall but you know the next day the sun come up just as bright as it ever did i imagine the borderline believers that said we'll grow up the old man could have been right about that so maybe science uh was wrong that there there could be some rain up there but remember it never rained but then the second day the sun was just as bright as it always was third fourth fifth sixth and even to the seventh day but noah had climbed up in the upper room so he could watch the skies and on that seventh morning when there come a time when people had refused god's absolute way of salvation of saving of the lives of the people the rains began to fall and the sewers filled up and the boat began to rise and it took noah and them to safety sure because they were trusting in god's word the absolute god's word of promise no matter how bad it seems like and how dark it gets still believe your absolute moses well his he had tried to save the life of those poor hebrews and they were almost as bad off or just as bad off as these two children are that were trying to save tonight they were slaves and they killed him just at random whenever they wanted to and moses felt in his heart that that wasn't the will of god so he he tried to do it through education he tried to do it to his own efforts and he found out that he miserably failed he did something himself that wasn't right because he took another man's life that was not right then he went into the wilderness and was there for 40 years but one day he was herding sheep on the backside of the desert and there was a light in a bush and when moses got near this light the voice of god spoke to him out of this pillar of fire laying back in this bush and said moses moses and he said you're my lord he said take off your shoes for the ground that you stand on is holy i have heard the groans of my people i've heard their prayer meetings i've remembered that i made them a promise if that ought to set the hearts of christian believers of fire tonight i am god i remember i promised how scriptural that voice was and he said moses i'm sending you down there to deliver them and moses of course as i said at the beginning when you take that absolute of god it makes you do things that uh well sometimes ridiculous in the sight of the people could you imagine a man that had run from the egyptians the next morning after seeing this absolute this word of god spoke to him positive witness because it was the word the promise was there and the vindication of the great god of creation how he performed a miracle in a in the presence of moses and showed that he was a god of creation and moses the next morning took his wife and set her on a mule with the the kid on her hip and the 80 years old whiskers hanging to his waistline his bald head shining with a crooked stick in his hand going down towards egypt shouting as hard as he could go where are you going moses i'm going down to egypt to take over take over a one-man invasion why he had an absolute he had something he had the word of god he could spit on a man of 80 years old with a mule and a stick in his hand that's all he had like a one-man invasion to russia today but he went down and took over because he had an absolute he had talked to god he had heard the voice of god and the thing of it was he did it right why that was with him all the days of his life it was an absolute no man has a right to climb into the pulpit to preach the gospel unless himself has treaded on those sacred sands where no agnostic or unbeliever can ever explain away the supernatural of god jesus would not let his disciples preach no matter how well they knowed him they must go to the city of jerusalem and wait till they was endued with power from unharmed they must have that experience moses knowing that he was a prophet nobody been raised up for this purpose but without that personal contact that absolute something it proved to him that when he went down there he was going to have deliverance for these people he was never the same he went down there because he had the absolute and he did just exactly what god told him to do there was no fear in his heart when he threw down the serpents or the rods and they turn to the serpent and the carnal impersonators come up with their type of ministry and throw down and done the same thing moses had done just exactly what god told him to do there was nothing for him to do but stand still and see the glory of god then we find out that god taken his serpent and eat up the rest of them that's the way it's done he was positive that the god that could tell him to do this could take care of him in the bad situations can't we tonight upon the basis of that young man giving his heart to christ stand upon this absolute that god can make the impossibles be possible he can change the hearts of judges [Applause] why do we skip so frantically about other things let's take god first bring it back to the promise god promised it if he would do it so remember moses was always a different person because he took god's word and believed it and he had a promise vindicated to him how many can we call we don't have time and writing note the day i was writing here of daniel how that it was a what it was it was a capital punishment for him to to pray to any other god but he had been in connection with god and he know that god was able to take care of him the hebrew children they'd be thrown into a fiery furnace and would be burned with heat seven times hotter than a furnace would ever be had that hebrew children believe god they said our god is able to deliver us from this furnace why they had had an absolute that had the word of god and the god that could deliver them hebrew children from the death cell of a fiery furnace how much more can he deliver this little jewish boy out here that's laying on her in a death cell how much more is in he's still the same jehovah god that he always was we like apostle paul can realize that same god lives today yesterday today and forever the same then christians can hold to god's unchanging hand and change the whole situation prayer changes things that's what we want to do how can we say about joshua how is he going to cross the jordan seemed like god was a strange military man right in the month of april when the waters was up like that but he said to joshua take the ark and go forward that's all he had to do and god moved back the jordan made dry grounds and they walked across and was delivered how well no one of joshua said for me and my house we'll serve the lord how david that great patriarch i would like to speak about him we have in time but in many times as we heard someone speaking a few moments ago about david and his sin but when all it was forgiven when he was going to battle and we call it in the world the chips were down and the opposition was great and david laid there under the tree and sweated out until he heard the sound going through the mulberry bushes then it was different david rose and went on because it he had an absolute that he knew that was god going on before him can't we pray a prayer of faith that will send god on to that parole board down there sure we can we believe that we can if we hold to that absolute how abraham called things that were not as though they were because he had an absolute promise from god that god was going to give him his give him a child by sarah when she was a hundred years old or he was and she was 90 he still didn't stagger at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god and we claim to be abraham's children when abraham when we've had the bible wrote since the days of abraham and all the witnesses that we've had behind the jehovah keeps his word that christ is the son of god he's a mediator between man and god and there's no other mediator besides him and promising if you ask the father anything in my name it'll be granted and we claim to be the children of abraham when abraham called things that were as though they were not because he believed god absolutely i believe it with all my heart paul's christ-centered life was his absolute entity christ was the absolute of the resurrection as we read here he said god swore by an oath to david that he would not leave his soul in hell the oath is the end of all strife and he swore that he would not leave his soul in hell but would raise him up and therefore he trusted god and was crucified died rose again and ascended into heaven because he believed god how much more as he's setting the example can we take the absolute if christ could take it upon that one promise there how much more can we take it with thousands of promises with the blood of jesus christ there to cleanse our way and bring us across that great chasm of sin that separated us of unbelief from god and bring us right into his presence to talk to him how much more could it be yes we've got to have an absolute i'm thinking of one right now as in closing would be george washington when america was young and we were fighting for life the life of this great nation that we have george washington was a christian he was a believer and down at valley forge i'm told that the american soldiers only had about one-third of them had on shoes and the winter was cold and the zero weather and the river frozen and gorging over and the british on the other side and the life of this little nation was at hand what did he do he was a christian he goes out in the night time and kneels down in the snow and prays until he was wet with snow water up around his waistline and he stayed there and prayed until he got the absolute the answer from god that god was going to give him the victory and the next day that valley forge was nothing to him he crossed the delaware pushed through the ice with half dressed soldiers half frozen their bare feet on the ground in the snow and he took it when three rifle bullets went through his coat why he was trusting in the absolute of an answered prayer hey man the very backgrounds of our nation based upon such a thing what's the matter with people today who claim to be christians why are we disturbed an hour like this let's not be disturbed let's be soldiers yes sir he prayed until he got that answer that no clouded river no bare feet soldiers regardless of the circumstance they could take it because god had said so a bullet couldn't even kill him for an enemy's rival certainly why it had a prayer meeting he got the answer how well it was one night when apostle peter was in the jail and they were going to kill him the next morning he was going to die under capital punishment this little jews go to do now but what did they do they did the same thing that we here in houston are trying to do they formed a prayer meeting at john mark's house while they were praying the angel of the lord went to the prison and opened up the prison bars and opened the gates and beyond that led peter i'd come right down to the prayer meeting i believe tonight that that same god lives if he is the same god then did something wrong certainly what was it done by a prayer meeting by faithful christians who believe and believe that god would deliver their brother from capital punishment them were christians who stayed all night and laid up on their faces and cried out and prayed as i heard one of the ministers a while ago saying he's gonna cry out all night long the trouble of it is today people let down they get tired sleepy they can't even sit through a 10-minute service harley it's something wrong if you love god where we should be busy it should be our our hopes our desires it should be everything that's in us should be in the love of christ hey man we set so slawful we set so unconcerned when the world's dying under our feet that's right man's lives going out without god and we set so so unconcerned about as long as we belong to the church that's all we think it makes a difference i was talking about the coming of christ a few weeks ago in a certain church an effort says someone met me in the back of the church and said brother brandon you scare people to death i said why do i do that he said well you're talking about the coming of christ i don't want to hear such things as that i got a little boy here i got to raise i got a girl in school well i said the coming of christ is the most glorious thing i can think of certainly see the bible said all those who love his appearing whoa my for a day that when this old marvel take on immortality in this this past house that a living will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and a body like his own glorious body it should be the heart's desire the church it should be every man and woman on fire preaching the streets and everywhere else trying to get souls saying certainly i'm wondering if we really tied to that absolute that we claim to are we looking at the right morning star if we're just trusting in our church and our denomination our affiliation as the world changes it changes with that round and around but there's one star that never changed there's one thing you can ever change that's god god cannot change his word cannot change his bible cannot change and if a man is born to the spirit of god with christ in him it punctuates every promise with an amen that is right certainly oh sure a prayer meeting is what we need we must be christians all christians must use this same absolute the word of god god's word is the christian state jesus said in his word if ye abide me my words abide in you then you can ask what you will and it will be done for you think of it what more of an absolute would you want what could you trust more in than something like that if you abide in me my words abide in you then ask what you will to ask for god to work upon the heart of that judge or that parole board and get that little fella out of that death cell if we asked it with faith believing in these prayer meetings we'll get it that's i just believe god like that i'm my faith that i have and god that's why i'm here tonight that's why i canceled out something else and got in here and got to drive hundreds of miles a night back to tucson arizona because i come to put my faith with yours that's a matter of souling hunter it's someone in need and we christians have got to wake up to a reality to real genuine faith tied to the word of god and plead that promise yes sir oh my if you abide in me in my word and you ask what you want and again if the people is called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then out here from heaven prayer meeting that's it i believe in talking to attorneys and talking to lawyers or judges or parole boards or whatever more that's all right but brother if your hope isn't tied to something and it's a carnal man of mine a mind of man rather you're sure be sadly disappointed but if you can tie your faith into such a place that you know and stay there and pray until god answers back and you know you've got it in your heart something's going to happen i've seen the dead race from a funeral home i've seen the the blind eyes come open the deaf ears unstopped i've seen cancer-ridden cases of sarcomas cancer leprosy healed by the power of the almighty god because they had faith to believe that that god who made the promise would be able to keep his promise that's real genuine faith like abraham had hi to their stay there and pray not just get out and god deliver the poor little fella and send him home we'd all like that but let's stay there until something happens oh when something happens then that assures could fall amongst this little handful of people sitting in this auditorium here tonight could fall among us right you're enough faith and power of god if we could pray through till we strike that homeline to that absolute comes down that same pillar of fire that was taken here in houston by ted kipperman's camera 12 years ago he's here tonight just as great as he was then to deliver that boy if we'll just believe it because he's the same yesterday today and forever i believe it with all my heart that's why i'm here to offer my prayer with you all that god will spare their life then if you can pray through until you've got to answer back got the assurance back like washington had like john mark had like daniel had like moses had so you've got an absolute something that you know that you can anchor to then up on this absolute i'll build my church and all the courts in the land cannot resist that's right upon that the very god that could take a little hook knows you like paul angry and going down there to put all the christians to death under capital punishment and could change him and make him a lovely christian that same god lives tonight can change law to grace any time that he takes an ocean to do it hallelujah you go to call me a holy roller anyhow so i might as well get started right now i believe that god amen yes sir then mark 11 22 when you prayed to he said i verily verily i say unto you have faith in god i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved when that absolute has come to you when you're anointed with that spirit that comes beyond all scientific control out yonder before there was an atom or a molecule that one has spoke everything into existence and when your soul is anchored to that there's nothing can stop it that's right say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you said if that ain't absolute to whole to certainly it is that's right an absolute now the nation has absolute your home life has absolute everywhere if it's ever going to achieve anything it's got to have an absolute we appreciate this attorney we appreciate all the other man this fine chaplain for here from california and what a marvelous message and our brother who tried to take the money and everything to try to help this poor woman and and with their children to deliver them that's all fine and we appreciate that and i'm for it but there's one thing beyond that friends when we're closing this meeting tonight we must tie it to an absolute a prayer meeting before god that will send the deliverers from the same jehovah god just as much god denied as he was saying hallelujah do you believe it let's stand up to our feet then and tonight form a prayer meeting in here until an absolute takes place raise up our hands before god pray until you strike home until an absolute falls into your heart lord god send your holy spirit down and sin and free those children your lord they're sitting in the regions of the shadows of death something sticks in the half and lord and we pray that these prayer meetings will strike far i believe you lord i'm accepting it and i believe that you'll deliver those children read it almighty god we your church asked it through jesus christ oh my can you take god at his word today like that can you know him in an assurity that he never fails it's it's it's inspiring to hear brother brandon preaching that way but even more so let it become an experience in your life that you're just as sure you're just as set you're believing that amen i don't know the results of that that boy they were praying for but i know god had it in his hands and i believe that the anchor holds though the ship is battered [Music] the anchor home though the ship is better i have fallen on my ears [Music] [Applause] in spite of the one more time the anger i have fallen [Music] on [Applause] in spite of the storms when brother murrell was praying and he said lord you know our thoughts you know everything about us and sometimes that might put a little fear in you but if you take him ahead his word he says if you'll confess and if he'll put it through the blood it's gone it's clear and you take a stand on that and you believe it you begin to take god at his word in everything he says and let that peace of god settle in your heart in in that atmosphere you create about yourself you know you might have come to church today and maybe you kneel down to pray and you start thinking and your mind starts to battle with the day you had or the problems you might have had but set all that aside and say lord i'm talking to you i'm going to you today and just believing that so we appreciate that the grace of god and the the excitement the um the energy that brother branham had to know that this god is alive and well by experience not by somebody else's testimony but by experience so i appreciate the grace of god to us to allow us to hear that and to know that i was telling brother jordan and went back there to give him the sermon because i forgot to tell him what it was and i just read an article today earlier somebody had posted about what the rich people that the very wealthy people are doing to prepare for the catastrophe they're expecting on this earth line up land in places that the oceans won't reach and they begin then to lay out all their plans what they're doing what they're thinking about because they know something's coming there's no question about it and where safety would be and the one thing i noticed they said it won't be caused by an earthquake it's going to be caused by something else i said the word of god tells us it will be caused by an earthquake so god keeps his word we know that but they're making all these plans to save their lives but we have an absolute we've committed our lives ourselves to jesus christ and just like those he's talked about daniel and the three hebrew children who said though they tell me and though god slays me yet i'll trust him that's our trust and that's our hope today so we stand on that [Music] i talked to my brother fred today and and he had the cancer in the esophagus and they declared him cancer-free on the last test and he said tell them tell them thank you for prayer because we know that's that's what would cause that to and we stand on that and if this old body fails i've got another one that's waiting for me nothing to fear so we appreciate that [Music] my daughter rachel and naomi took nina to the airport up in mesa to fly home and they were on their way back and nina called them and said my flight's been canceled and something happened with the crew and they couldn't fly so they drove back up to bring her back down and she's going to stay till saturday now so we're okay with that but god knows why you don't know the circumstances and i know stephen is probably a little disappointed or maybe he's not i don't know but i know they were talking to each other yesterday and they were missing each other quite a bit but god has it all in his hands and we appreciate that god would do those things for us brother jordan had to sing in the presence of jehovah troubles vanish everything when you can get into that presence rather than what's going on around you and let that settle in your heart so we'll sing that song with just a couple of announcements before we go but again this this sunday morning service [Music] followed by the potluck and then the church we call it a business meeting with the congregation around four o'clock but also brother matthew watkins will be coming in and be with us on sunday morning and also um we'll be staying through part of the week administering wednesday night and it's something he has asked this weekend when we we have some time and the church sits together maybe we will have more information as to which way to go forward also next sunday next weekend brother tim cross is coming down and we had previously invited him and it worked out the fellowship meetings up in flagstaff are the following weekend and lord willing myself and my wife will be going up there on thursday taking a few days spending a little bit of a celebration of our 42nd wedding anniversary and just get away for a few days but uh god said he'd be with us and never leave us so just keep that in mind be in prayer lord you lead us you guide us we're you are our absolute your word is the truth you know do you hear what people say and and and i know our feelings get in the way and our anxiousness and our worry we're human but take it back to the word of god and say lord you said lord you said and i'll stand on that if you stand with me in the presence man and hearts [Music] in the present [Music] from [Music] in ah let's try that first verse [Applause] for the answers that i need [Music] all my questions become clear and for a sacred moon no doubt can interfere in the presence [Music] trump and hearts [Music] the second verse [Music] a place to find the answers [Music] to give up in despair just in the presence [Music] hearts are made [Music] so sweet to trust in jesus just to take him at his word brother peter i don't know if you could come up and pray with abel or not or maybe you could just pray from back there if that would be okay you want to come on up is that be all right i know he's watching and he'll he'll dismiss us in prayer and we'll sing this psalm as we're going [Music] so you trusting in the lord amen he's unfailing [Music] let's all pray dear lord jesus it's been good to be gathered here in your presence today to have our faith lifted up lord look to your promises [Music] lord to know that there's no shadow of turning in you the lord that what you've promised you'll fulfill to us lord and the grace that's brought us this far is the same grace that'll bring us home pray that you forgive us of every sin lord everything that would hinder the movement of your spirit and pray go with each one lord and bless those that weren't able to make it father i pray that you would just help us to

give us not just wisdom but lord lead us by your spirit and give us wisdom as well help us just to surrender to you father we love you we thank you for calvary lord for your blood lord that covers all our sins and gives us a great hope that we'll be like you and when you come lord at your appearance thank you father in jesus name amen [Music] we'll sing a verse or two and then you're dismissed to
