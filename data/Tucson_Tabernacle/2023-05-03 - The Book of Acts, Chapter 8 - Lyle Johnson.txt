we leave this place what up what a time I've been I said the animals the lion shall lay down by the lamb what a day that's going to be [Music] God bless you all I wanted to make a couple announcements first hold off for just a few minutes um the as I said on the WhatsApp broadcast this morning the Jericho Tabernacle up in Phoenix I rented a van and I can take as many as can fit in that van with me and if you want to go I know some of the brothers have already told me but if you want to go tell me so I know how many hotel rooms to get and then next Friday we are going to have a youth Gathering and this one's for the younger youth the parents of course are welcome the uh we'll probably start at about six o'clock next Friday and go till about nine o'clock and that's that's again here at the church we're glad to have one of our pianos piano players back with us sister Lily [Applause] I was so worried she was going to meet some European boy and stay there you and your sister I'm glad you're back and then uh yeah so her and sister Grace have been there visiting friends and and seeing the country in Europe it's good to have them back and I'm also thankful that we have such a great piano player to back them up in Sister Martha just I saw her just take the baby back but God bless her and using her talent to be a blessing to us um I was looking at this brother right here in the front brother I forgot your name right brother Raphael I was talking with brother Rafael on Sunday and it was after service and brother Raphael told me he says he says I missed most of service he said because um you had trouble with the bus am I right I missed the bus and I and I walked down Romero and on Miracle Mile then came then they went then went on Blackledge and then went to first and then went down first to Glenn and then it went West on Glenn to Geronimo and then went down Geronimo to toe and then over here yeah let me tell you God bless your heart my brother foreign [Applause] touched me my brother telling me that on Sunday that he went to such an effort to get here because it's important to him brother Raphael God bless your heart I was in Peru a number of years ago and we have meetings there and we're over um I forgot I think we're in a church or I forgot exactly where we were but uh this man showed up in very very short man real real dark complected and um he came in he greeted agreed the Brethren and he um we shook his hand and he went and he sat down just quiet and just watching us so intently and um it's such a nice spirit and I noticed of course they speak Spanish in Peru I noticed that the brothers the translators were having trouble understanding him and it's because Spanish wasn't his native language he spoke in Indian dialect and as he was talking um with some of the brothers he wouldn't say anything while we were there he just wanted to listen to what we had to say and then he he would he would have the translator tell him and uh after a while I found out that he was a Shepherd that lived way up in the mountains of Peru up in the Andes Mountains and he had heard that we were going to be in town in Lima and he started his journey from way up there to his his little place and he lived in just a little Hut way up in the mountains and he started his journey and he walked all day to a road where he could catch a bus and he caught the bus and he traveled I think it was 24 hours on the bus and then he got off the bus and he he walked across Lima to meet us he was a three-day Journey just because he wanted to meet us and to hear what we have to say let me tell you who is the great man cousin Jonathan who's the great man that would make such an effort to do that and let me tell you that man just like our brother Raphael here he will have his reward so many of us won't even walk across the street to go to church or to to greet someone but to hear little things like like you did and it was hot on Sunday and and what you went through I know it wasn't what that that little Peruvian brother did but brother it was a great effort and I think about how many of us would make that effort so I mean God bless your heart my friend I pray that the Lord will return everything that you've given that he'll return it to you a hundredfold and I know that you'll receive whatever you have on your heart whatever you're asking for because you made the effort that kind of stuff blesses me to see Brethren like this and and the spirit is any different I've been to Africa and wherever I wherever we were in Africa we'd have these meetings and and we'd see people coming in that were on one day journey two day Journey three day brother Jonathan those big flatbed trucks that they travel on probably put 30 or 40 of them in the back of that truck traveling from way out in the bush in Africa just to to just get a little bit of the Lord to just hear a testimony to just to just get something that strengths and strengthens them and I just I'm I'm just grateful beyond measure that there's still people like that in the world and I want to be like that I want to be one of those people like our our brother here like that brother in Peru like these African brothers and sisters that would make such an effort and I'm just grateful I'm grateful that there is something that's worth our efforts right here um we we don't have any written prayer requests there brother Aaron told me about brother Justin Brown he um did the videos for harmony here and brother Aaron said he's even spoken at this church before he but Aaron told me his dad passed away recently so if we could remember him so let's stand friends God is still God we have about 50 people in service tonight and he's the god of the small Gatherings just like he's the god of the big gatherings he honors his word and as we go through this book of Acts maybe Place yourself as one of these characters we're going to hear about a lot of different people tonight as brother Lyle reads this chapter to us and expounds on it put yourself in the position of one of these brothers or sisters that you hear about and know that that he's the same God today as he was 2000 years ago so let's bow our heads and if you have requests upon your heart the same Lord Jesus that answered in the book of Acts is the same Lord Jesus that is on the throne today and he'll answer [Music] raise your hand if you have a request Lord God Almighty as you look down upon this congregation and you've seen the hands raised Lord we can just sing out how great you are how much we love you Lord and how much Lord we rely on you every single day knowing that these hands that were raised that they had to make an effort Lord however small that effort might seem it was still an effort Lord to have this request answered and we pray that every hand that was raised that you would answer those requests and Lord we want to tell you tonight that we love you we thank you for all that you've done for us we pray father for brother Lyle as he comes to take the pulpit Lord we pray that your anointing would be on him and father as he expounds on this this all-important chapter in the book of Acts father that we would understand what was going on at that time and that we would be able to apply it into our lives [Music] father we're just grateful we're grateful that we have a bible to read knowing that the people in this book of Acts very few of them probably none of them had a Bible they just had a few Scrolls that maybe they could get a hold of to read and go to the synagogue and have one of the brothers read to them and how much they appreciated it father we're grateful that you've given us so much in this day we don't want to take it for granted we thank you Lord we love you we pray that you would be with us tonight in the name of your son Jesus Christ amen [Music] foreign [Music] I have your words I have your way s [Music] as we pray speak your word once more please have your way I have your way making a prayer Holy Spirit fill our hearts and have your will as we as we pray to speak your word into our hearts and have your ways thank you so much good evening tonight we're going to continue our Wednesday evening study on the book of Acts this time our chapter is acts 8 but before I even do that I've got to share a little testimony with you you know it's the little things that that you know they say the little foxes spoil the grapes but it's the little things that if we just notice the Lord is so present I was back there reviewing my notes and even though we're dealing with Acts chapter 8 there's a portion of my notes that come from John chapter four and just as I was reading about the woman at the well from my notes brother Aaron was singing fill my cup Lord and it was the verse about that thirsting woman and I thought Lord Jesus if I had any doubts about tonight they're gone thank you Lord thank you Lord that there there's a lot going on in this section and yeah well it's not that's a long time till midnight we've got time but but we should get right to it so let's just pray together one more time lord Jesus we're here Lord because we love you we're here because we love each other we're here Lord because we want to join our Spirits together when worship and praise to you we're here because we want to hear from you we're an expectation Lord that you will use these frail broken human vessels Lord to speak your word to touch our hearts to answer our questions Lord Lord we commit this evening to you the rest of this evening to you we thank you for your mercy and Grace Lord and I pray that you would forgive me Lord for every wrong thought every every wrong deed every thing in my life that's not pleasing to you Lord and just get Lyle Johnson out of the way Lord that we can hear from you that's our desire we thank you in Jesus precious name amen amen while we're standing I'd like you to turn your Bibles to our introductory verse instead of Acts 8 1 let's turn to acts 1 8. in fact let's start at 1-6 to lay a foundation for one of the lessons of chapter eight these are among the very last words that Jesus spoke immediately before his Ascension telling the disciples the purpose of the infilling of the previously promised Holy Spirit acts 1 6 and when they that's the 11 disciples now called Apostles therefore were come together they asked of Jesus saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel you know take this room and he said to them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but he continued ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and to what end for what purpose ye shall be Witnesses unto me or Witnesses of me in Jerusalem and in all judeo and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the Earth and when he had spoken these things while baby held he was taken up acts 8 will detail for us how the followers of Jesus spread the gospel message exactly as Jesus instructed them in Acts 1 8 please be seated we ask ourselves what might Jesus have meant is this instruction or is it prophecy how does it apply to acts eight the disciples had asked if he would restore the kingdom to Israel at this time to take his throne as ruler of the world and he said that's not for you to know when that's going to happen but he continued you shall receive power and be my Witnesses and then he lists some places where are Jerusalem Judea Samaria What's significant about that what might this mean the uttermost part of the Earth let's take a brief look here I've got a little map of some of the the Roman provinces and uh and what we think of Israel at the time of Jesus Jerusalem I've got to your right a little arrow pointing where where Jerusalem is that's one of the places it was specified here and the districts or provinces of Judea and Samaria and we're also Familiar of course if you go north of Samaria to Galilee which is where Jesus grew up it's where his ministry was based but if we step back just a little bit I show here a map of the Roman Empire at the time of Jesus and at the time of the acts I've indicated Jerusalem again so you can sort of get get an anchor point there the lands there's you can see a dotted line going up and down in the middle of that map the the places that are to your right to the east we're conquered by Alexander in the 320s BC his territory extended beyond the right side of the map as far as the western edge of India modern day Afghanistan and Pakistan and uh and Iraq and Iran and so forth the area to the west of the dotted line including Italy and Spain and France which I've also labeled they weren't conquered by Alexander but by Rome this Mediterranean area this Roman Empire area is most of the world as the people of the Bible were aware when Jesus says the uttermost part of the earth he's not necessarily referring to the planet as we know it in the 21st century but he's referring to the world is just his disciples understood it in their context well with that background for acts 1 8 and the acts of the overall setting for the entire book of Acts will do a very brief condensed review of Acts and get rolling and acts 1 Jesus gives the instructions as we just read he ascends the Believers wait in Jerusalem for the baptism of the Holy Spirit to give them power to be Witnesses and during that time they select Matthias to replace Judas to bring their numbers back to 12. in Acts 2 we read about The Filling of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost Peter's first sermon the formula we're so familiar with in Acts 2 38 repent be baptized receive the promise of the Holy Spirit three thousand were added to their small number at that time and that's the first mention of having all things in common in Acts 3 Peter and John are headed to the temple they go by the gate called Beautiful there's a beggar that's been there for decades he's miraculously healed everybody wants to find out what's going on and Peter starts with his second sermon now in the temple area but before he can finish that sermon he's arrested put in jail the next morning they reply to the council the council is afraid of the people so they threaten and release them they go and report to the Believers and they all pray for boldness Lord we don't want to be discouraged in the face of these threats and they get the second in filling of the Holy Spirit the whole building shakes and there's a second mention of all things in common which leads into chapter five where we have some people that are trying to impress others and not being honest ananias and Sapphira die lying there's many miracles we're told that happen through the apostles and they're arrested arrested charged and respond the council wants to kill them but a man named Gamaliel intervenes to prevent their execution instead they're flogged beaten really badly again threatened and released at Acts chapter 6 people were starting to complain about well your group is getting more food at the distribution of the daily stuff than our group is and there's a some contention going on so the congregation dominates seven deacons the apostles approve that selection and Stephen one of the seven is witnessing and preaching and debating he's arrested lying Witnesses come and he's tried before that Council in Acts seven we hear about Stephen's defense before the council a masterful sermon well he seized taken outside the city and stoned and it's the first mention of Saul well let's let's pick it up now with the closing verses of chapter seven we'll start at verse 55 just to give us a a a a segue into into chapter eight at the end of his uh sermon Stephen has dropped all pretense of political correctness and he's just gets in their face hearing these accusations these guys become so enraged they start grinding their teeth and it says but but Stephen being full thank God he was full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and he wasn't afraid to tell these very angry people about that he said behold I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of God at this the the members of the council cried out with a loud voice they wanted to drown him out they didn't want to hear anymore they stopped their ears so they wouldn't hear this blasphemy and they ran upon Stephen with one Accord even Pharisees and Sadducees can agree on some things and they cast even out of the city stoned him that means they picked up big rocks and bashed him until his bones were broken and life was Christ and the witnesses remember these are the false Witnesses the lying Witnesses they laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul this is just part of their their process of doing this so Saul is playing a role in this it's a formal role it's it's a role and and this tells us that not only you Saul a young man she's well connected he's serving the council in this portion of this execution well we'll see much more of him in later chapters and as they stoned Stephen he was calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down as the rocks and stones began striking him and cried with a loud voice more lay not this into their charge and when he had said this Stephen fell asleep he collapsed he's badly injured he's no longer kneeling and the Lord Jesus received his spirit acts 8 verse 1. Saul was consenting unto his desk again Saul was playing a formal role in this martyrdom of Stephen but Luke is careful here to point out he didn't say Saul disagreed Luke is pointing out his attitude yes this is the right way to stamp out this heresy kill the Heretics and at that time that is just after the stoning of Stephen there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem it's not small it's not minor it's a great persecution but look at it from the perspective of Acts 1 8 that we just read the final words of Jesus before he ascended keep that in mind and they the Believers in Jesus of Nazareth a little footnote when we lived in Israel the Hebrew word for Christian is for Christians is notes ream which basically means from Nazareth right so even today in Hebrew they call you a Christian they're really calling you a person from Nazareth or that you believe in Jesus of Nazareth they were all scattered abroad through the regions of Judea and Samaria sept the apostles so we're setting the stage for the spreading of the Gospel that we just read you shall be Witnesses unto me and all Judea and Samaria so here we see the next stage of spreading the gospel is now set note Luke tells us that the apostles the twelve if you will were not among those that left Jerusalem under the persecution we'll see an aspect of the importance of this when we get to verse 5. I can't help but think there was another time when God commanded people this was after the flood to spread out fill the Earth take their place they wouldn't do it Genesis 11 4 tells us specifically they were resisting doing it Genesis 11 8 tells of the linguistic confusion that God sent them at Babel to force their compliance here we see that Jesus at his Ascension told the apostles to scatter after they carried in Jerusalem and received the baptism of the Holy Spirit to be Witnesses but we're just right here they remained in Jerusalem even with the persecution so persecution came forcing a scattering we read here and devout men carried Stephen while They Carried Stephen's body Jesus had received his spirit so They Carried Stephen's body to his burial and made great lamentation over him he was such a powerful witness that they had lost but it was fulfilling part of what we just read in Acts 1 8 you'll be Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem well if you were keeping a scorecard for acts 1 8 it might look something like this you might ask yourself well that's kind of strange brother Lyle well I'd say yeah why keep a scorecard the Believers expected Jesus return at any moment any day when they when they were asking him about when he was coming to restore the kingdom his reply is that they wouldn't know but they were given a job to do witness and preach Jesus in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the uttermost part of the Earth now some 20 years later Paul wrote In First Corinthians 15 to the Corinthian Believers as some people were dying they were getting older getting older and and they were very disturbed about this that they would miss the second coming of the Lord that they'd miss out on eternal life so Paul wrote the words in First Corinthians 15 that we read at almost every funeral to give them comfort and encouragement I remember back in the 1960s and 70s many of us were counting down the years to 1977. would say well now now here's the revelation of Christ's return the prophet said after a disclaimer that Jesus had returned by 1977. it's on tape more than once so it's got to be true I along with many others skipped college or university expecting the second coming between mid-1973 and the end of 1977. some of you were alive at that time many of you weren't but I can identify with these guys that just heard in Acts 1 8 about about I'm their question their question was when are you coming back and he said well that's not for you to know but and he gave them these instructions I can I can virtually guarantee that there were people that were keeping a scorecard when the gospel was spread in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the outermost part of the earth Jesus is coming you can take it to the bank that's what he said in response to our question I was there I heard him before he ascended but Jesus instructs instruction in Jerusalem and neither will we let's go to verse 3. as for Saul the well-connected young man before whom the false Witnesses laid their garments at the execution of Stephen Saul made havoc of the church what does havoc mean this is a strange word it means shamefully treated with cruelty and violence he made havoc in that church at Jerusalem entering into every house open up open up going from door to door and hailing that means dragging out men and women and committed them to prison prisons were not nice places setting up things for a Pastor Daniel for Acts chapter 9. therefore they that were scattered abroad that is those that fled from the persecution in the city of Jerusalem they went everywhere throughout the provinces of Judea and Samaria remember the map if you leave Jerusalem you're in Judea if you go very far north you're in Samaria and what were they doing as they were scattering they were hiding and cowering preaching the word the gospel the good news of Salvation through faith in Jesus Christ then Philip now this is Philip the Deacon one of the seven not the Philip mentioned in the gospels one of the twelve remember in verse 1 Luke specifically told us the apostles did not leave Jerusalem so there's no confusion here this is Philip the Deacon remember when we talked about that I said of these seven men there were two names that were really outstanding the first is Stephen that we just read about and the second this is Philip so this Phillip went down to the city of Samaria more about this in a moment and preached Christ unto them where Samaria oh another check box what that's what we read right be Witnesses in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria well who made the scorecard probably was Matthew he was he was litter he was a numbers guy hey Matthew please check the box Mark Samaria I can't read it but you can oh two down two to go then Jesus can come back how's it going down there in Samaria anyway there we go and the people of the city of Samaria with one Accord in agreement with one another gave heed now gave heed means that they didn't just hear but they listened they listened they paid attention and they followed through unto those things which Philip spoke and here's why they weren't just hearing his words they were also seeing Miracles which he did what sort of Miracles were being wrought by the hand of Philip there in Samaria for unclean spirits crying out with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies that's like paralysis or like Parkinson's disease and so forth and they that were lame were healed and as a result of all this there was great joy in that City there's so much Bible History associated with the region known as Samaria the people known as Samaritans and the City of Samaria the city of Samaria was built about 875 BC there was this guy named Omri he was a king in Israel I think he was about the seventh king of Israel after things got divided he was the father of the infamous Ahab he bought a hill property built a city which she named Samaria hence the city of Samaria and from which Ahab ruled this became the capital of the northern kingdom called Israel in the books of kings and Chronicles it was pillaged and depopulated about 150 years later by the syrians around around what 723 BC the Assyrians removed most of the Jewish population we talk about the 10 lost tribes and they resettled the area with people from other portions of their empire of that time that was a strategy that they employed whatever they conquered well when the temple was rebuilt under Ezra and Nehemiah about 200 years later 525 BC plus minus there was a problem when the returning Jewish population intermarried with the residents of the territory which were a mixture of peoples from the Assyrian resettlement in the end the people of Samaria were a mixture of Jewish and non-jewish ethnicity and culture and of course that spilled over into religion at the time of Jesus we talk about the Pharisees and the Sadducees sometimes we talk about the essays but the Samaritans were also a sizable group with their own set of doctrines and interpretations of the Torah the the Books of Moses which they held as being Holy scripture in fact they didn't recognize anything but what we call the pentateuch the five books of Moses well we read uh for example did you ever think when Jesus Met 10 lepers he told them to show themselves to the priests he was talking to Samaritans so they were being sent not to Jerusalem to the Jewish priests but to the Samaritan priests you can read it in Luke 17 verses 11 through 19. but Jesus told his disciples when he sent them out in Paris Matthew 10 these 12 Jesus set forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any City this Americans enter ye not huh yet earlier in his ministry he sent his disciples away to buy lunch so he could meet with the person we call the woman at the well and where is that Samaria specifically the town of psycho in John 4 this is what I was reviewing when brother Aaron sang that verse earlier this evening the woman saith unto him after he told her personal things he could not have known sir I perceive thou art a prophet so let me ask you something our fathers worshiped in this mountain that's Mount gerizim and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship our Doctrine and interpretation of Moses as we appear Mount charism not Jerusalem you Jews say the opposite what do you say about that which of us are correct Jesus said to her woman believe me the hour comes when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father it isn't about mountains angiography or temples and altars to obey is better than sacrifice right ye Samaritans worship ye know not what you worship what you don't comprehend we know what we worship salvation is of the Jews we're called to be a blessing to All Nations but the hour comes and now is when the true the real the worshipers that God will accept be they Jewish or Samaritan shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him and let me tell you why God is a spirit they that worship Him should want to no they must worship him in where or how spirit and in truth the spirit isn't enough the truth isn't enough both are necessary neither is sufficient by itself the unnamed woman goes into the town and tells of her encounter many people come to investigate her claim skipping down to verse 39 many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever I did but so when the Samaritans were coming to Jesus they besought him that he would tarry with them and he Abode there two days he went from sending his disciples to go grab some lunch while he talked with this lady he stayed there for two days I don't think he was sleeping during that time and many more believed because of his own word the son of God in Samaria and they said to the woman now we believe not because of I saying or not just because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world now after two days he departed fencing went into Galilee later as he was making his final journey to Jerusalem he passed through Samaria likely the same area mentioned in John 4 this is found in Luke 9. starting at verse 51. it came to pass when the time was come that Jesus should be received up he steadfastly he resolutely set his face he was determined to go to Jerusalem we'll read later in a passion and acts where there's another man that's determined to go to Jerusalem and Jesus sent Messengers some of his disciples before his face ahead of him and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him for Jesus that's very likely this could be the same Village or one nearby there's not that many roads that go between Galilee and Jerusalem given the Revival of just a few years earlier when they declared that he's the Christ the savior of the world they expected no issue in finding a place to stay for the night these people had asked them to stay for two days before however the Samaritans when they the Samaritans of the village did not receive Jesus why because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem he was determined to go to Jerusalem not good according to their doctrine of holy places thanks for the Miracles thanks for the healing Jesus yeah you're the anointed one but you know you're human and humans make mistakes and going to Jerusalem is a mistake and we're just going to have no part of that that just doesn't line up with the way we see things Jerusalem really when his disciples James and John John keeps coming up here and acts right when James and John saw this rejection they said Lord will thou that we command fire to come down from heaven Elias did these guys these ungrateful submares but Jesus turned and rebuked them sculpted them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of for the son of man is not come to destroy men's lives but to save them context Jesus is heading to Jerusalem knowing what lies ahead for this very purpose draw your circle of Fellowship larger don't get all exclusive and smug and they they all went to another Village presumably in other Samaritan Village remember the woman at the well debated with him briefly saying our father's Worship in this mountain not Jerusalem the Samaritans didn't want to have this Jesus around if he's going against their Doctrine about Jerusalem spirit and truth right well we Samaritans have the truth about where to worship and it sure isn't Jerusalem regardless Samaria had received witness directly from Jesus many believed Miracles had happened the ground in fact was already prepared for Philip Jesus said in the same section of John chapter 4 that one sows another reaps but both are blessed so we return now to Acts chapter 8 verse 9 will We join Philip among the Samaritans we read there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery Bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself with some great one sorcery sorcerer this is the Greek the word for this is Magi magician it's the very same word he used to described the three that we call the wise men that came to Jesus when he was very young and brought gold and frankincense and Moon Sorcerers magicians it's exactly the same word to whom they the people of the city all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God we certainly did have him Bewitched he was quite influential he's regarded as being so spiritual guy and to him to this Simon they had regard because out of long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries we don't have any details about how this influence and deception was cultivated just that it was but one day the people of the city believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women no longer following Simon then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done how do you do that Philip my incantations don't work quite that well there's no indication that Simon didn't believe he said he believed but we remember the words written in James 2 19. thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble however we see that Philip or someone he designated baptized Simon it only seems reasonable that he repented of his sins they knew you don't just baptize a person before they repent right so at least Simon must have claimed to have done so he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus now when the apostles which were still at Jerusalem a reminder that they hadn't left heard that Samaria had received the word of God the gospel they sent unto them they sent to the Samaritans two of their number namely Peter and John fire from heaven John going back to Samaria I'm sure that he remembered that he recalled that as he journeyed who when they were come down Peter and John to Samaria it's interesting you know the little sidebar that when we lived in Israel when one goes to Jerusalem if we say that a lot to go up you always go up to Jerusalem when you leave Jerusalem you always go down lamata that's just how it is there's only one person that ever went up from Jerusalem and we read about that in Acts it was Jesus at the Ascension so they came down and when they were come to Samaria Peter and John prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost that's interesting for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so they'd repented they were baptized they had the promise but they didn't have the possession yet Philip had the Holy Ghost of course but brother Raven tells us Peter had the keys well then late day Peter and John the apostles laid their hands on them the Samaritan Believers and this Americans received the Holy Ghost hmm Simon's observing all of this wow and when Simon wondering at all of this saw observed realized that through the laying on of the Apostles hands Holy Ghost was given he Simon offered them Peter and John money saying give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost the key to understanding this section of the narrative is motive right we're taught to check your motive why are you doing this your objective what do you hope to achieve this guy had a problem with it's not just a simple misunderstanding Simon wasn't seeking this power to help others but to help himself to retain or recover or retain his influence as the power of God said unto Simon thy money perish with thee that's strong words Peter is not a happy camper when he hears this from Simon by money perish with you because thou Hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money Simon this is a gift not a product this is not some sort of power based on an incantation in the name of Jesus I command you receive though it no no it's it's not sorcery we're not some secret capital you've got it completely wrong Simon you're coming from a bad place and not going to a good one thou Hast neither partner lot in this matter you have no part in this ministry and here's why why for thy heart is not right and the sight of sight of so Simon here's what you need to do repent turn around change your attitude change of heart repent therefore of this thy wickedness Own It Simon and pray God if perhaps the thought the evil intent of your heart may be forgiven you perhaps I say perhaps because I perceive I see I recognize I have Insight that reveals that thou art in the gall of bitterness Simon you're poisoned by bitter jealousy of what you see in US and you're in the bond of iniquity you're held captive Simon by sin then answered Simon and said pray you to the Lord for me that none of these things that you have spoken come upon me this is a request motivated by fear he knows he's seen the power of these Apostles but it's not accompanied by repentance there's no change of heart he recognizes Peter has what it takes but Simon doesn't respond with you're right help me overcome this brother I repent God forgive me no I don't want that to happen you've got the power to make it not happen intervene for me please Peter's given Simon Direction Simon's not taking the advice and it's the last we hear assignment now by the way it's not the last Hitler Simon there's one more thing I need to bring up there's did you know that there's a word in the English language that's derived from this part of Acts 8. when I read the definition to you you'll see the irony and the Catholic practice in medieval times of selling indulgences bishoprics and so forth to the office of the Pope which they claimed was held by Apostolic succession from Peter himself and the word is simony you can look it up in any dictionary you want going back hundreds of years it's an English word and I'll just read the first definition I'm not going to worry with all of it the buying or selling of ecclesiastical offices or of indulgences or other spiritual things okay now we will leave Simon we'll get back to Acts chapter eight we're not leaving acts verse 25 and they Peter and John when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord to the Samaritans in the city return to Jerusalem and as they made their way they preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans well so far in chapter 8 we've had an introduction to Saul we see the gospel preached in Jerusalem and in Samaria we're seeing the Holy Spirit as a gift from The Sovereign God not a product to be bought and sold we must always remember that we are tools in his toolbox I've too often seen it the other way around people commanding or demanding that God do this or that he's Sovereign he is in control we are not well let's see what else happens in this chapter verse 26 and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and go toward the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert this is a road that passes through a part of the parched Sinai Luke's careful to record the angel pointed out and this journey will go into the desert it's important that we understand that Philip has been as married to the north now he has a long hot Dusty walk south days and days like you were talking about earlier brother and Philip resisted this oh no he arose and went I I sometimes think that maybe this was a prompting of the Angel of the Lord rather than just a nudging of the holy spirit because he was going to be going through Jerusalem he was going through a dangerous place he'd fled from there and now the Lord is saying go down to this place on the road from the place you just left and by the way it's on the other side of that place so so here we see Samaria where he's coming down to Jerusalem and then taking a road across the desert to Gaza gaza's in the news even today I think it's uh it's not not a good place well so Philip's walking and Philip couldn't read ahead like we can he didn't know what would happen maybe martyrdom like his friend Stephen he simply obeyed trusting the word of the angel I think the Lord might have just been giving him a little extra assurance that things were going to be okay well let's continue Phillips now made his way down into the southern desert and behold a man of Ethiopia a eunuch of great Authority Under Candace Queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure all the nation's wealth he was he was the treasure he was kind of the the Janet Yellen of his day under that government he had come to Jerusalem for to worship that's a Curious Thing we see that this is a man of Jewish faith why else come to Jerusalem to worship from such a great distance this is many many hundreds of miles perhaps a thousand miles or more it's a long way to go well perhaps there's a link back to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba we don't exactly know where Sheba is but some place it as being in Ethiopia anyway regardless this is a man who has come to Jerusalem he believes Judaism right he's a high-ranking man and we read that he was returning to Ethiopia and he's sitting in his Chariot as a word that's used I think Carriage might be a little more appropriate this isn't have been her racing vehicle one designed for long-distance travel and what's he doing as he's wildling away the time he's not playing cards with somebody else in the carriage with him he read isaius the prophet there's a lot of things that are indicated here one this is definitely a person of great wealth he had possession of a scroll these are horribly expensive things and they didn't have Bibles you had a scroll of Genesis an a school of Exodus and a school and so forth if you've got you know 40 odd books in the in the Old Testament in the Jewish Bible the Tanakh then you've got that many Scrolls they're all very expensive but not only did he have that that he could say look at me I own a scroll he could read it so he was an educated man and the scroll as we'll see was written in Greek it was part of the Septuagint but we'll see why we know this in a couple of more verses but let's see it with this word Chariot this is our standard stereotype okay it's a lightweight racing vehicle no place to sit much less read a valuable and fragile scroll in the hot Judean Desert Sun in the summertime here we see a a reconstruction of a Roman Carriage that was found near Pompeii and they looked at the wrecked one that they found in the archaeological dig and constructed a model of it a full-scale one this is in a museum in Cologne Germany I doubt if you saw it when you were there I don't know if you were in Cologne on this trip okay well when you go back check out the carriage at the smaller illustration is a drawing depicting what a traveling Carriage may have looked like in the end we don't know what's convenience used by the Ethiopian might have been but it's more likely close to one of these a place to sit shade room for the sorts of things of very wealthy traveler going over great distances might require another thing to note is that while Roman roads were extensive and durable they were not smooth I I think that some of the folks that handled the roads here in Tucson went saw Roman roads and and bring that that Adventure back to us here in our town so travel would be slow noisy tiring not very comfortable this would allow Philip to walk alongside along with undoubtedly an armed retinue that's in the employee of Ethiopia that's protecting this guy and his stuff so the Ethiopian maybe he was reading aloud so he could maybe so he could better concentrate I remember when when I was younger yeah they had printed materials that when I was younger and I was reading or studying something sometimes I would read it aloud to help drown out noise distractions that were around me to help me concentrate well let's read on here in verse 29 read then the spirit that's not the angel this time Phillips already there he's gone past the dangerous place but it's that still Small Voice it's that nudge said unto Philip go near join yourself to walk alongside this Chariot discourage this conveyance and Philip hesitantly bashfully awkwardly no Philip ran feather to him Lord you told me to do this I'm going to do it with enthusiasm and dedication you told me to get next to that guy I'm getting next to him so he ran further to him and he heard him read so he was reading out loud he heard him reading out loud the prophet Isaiah and Philip recognizing the passage said asked understand thou with thou readest hey Ethiopian rich guy do you know what you're reading and the man from Ethiopia said how can I accept some man should guide me I need a teacher a tutor are you one do you know what this means so he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him now notice this man was spending his time seeking to better know the Lord he made a long trip to Jerusalem to worship he's making a long trip home but he's not leaving his religion behind in Jerusalem he's studying he's trying to understand he's reading the words of a prophet he was having trouble understanding it but that didn't stop him from reading it that didn't stop him from trying that didn't stop him for making that effort whatever do we make whatever does Lyle make the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shiver so opened he not his mouth and his humiliation his judgment was taken away who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the Earth this is from the Greek Septuagint not from the Hebrew masoretic text I'd like to just quickly compare this quote from acts verse 33 and we'll compare it with an English translation of that same verse an English translation from the Greek Septuagint and also a King James passage of that same verse it's found in Isaiah which is translated from the Hebrew it'll help you see how we can usually determine if the Greek or the Hebrew texts are being quoted and then there's a purpose for this acts 8 33 the King James and his humiliation his judgment was taken away who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the Earth lxx that 70. it's an abbreviation for this up too again it says in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken away from the earth almost exactly the same and we've gone through multiple levels of translation so it's the same but in the King James from the Hebrew it says he was taken from prison and from judgment and his humiliation as he was taken that's expressed very differently and who shall declare his generation for he was cut out of the land of the living so we can see that this fellow is reading from the Greek don't you love how God prepares things this guy is a deacon he's a Hellenistic Deacon he's a deacon that speaks and reads and understands Greek not Hebrew remember the the struggle that there was a couple of chapters ago between the Greeks and the Hebrews so God has arranged for this guy to be speaking the right language at the right time to be at the right place when this guy happens to be reading a scripture out of Isaiah 53 that things don't just happen things don't just happen and and he didn't get all uptight and say well here are you from the step two again what's the matter with you you got to go back to the original Hebrew yeah yeah he wasn't arguing about King James versus new international no no he said that's what you got we'll go with it brother let's go on let's read on so verse 34 and the eunuch answered Philip and said I pray thee please tell me of whom speaks the Prophet this of himself or some other man then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus you know in our day we claim to be part of those that have their hearts turned to the apostolic fathers we talk about it in the book of Acts note that in all cases of the miraculous there's active witnessing going on not just live the life that others can observe you but risk putting your foot in your mouth and say something and this is all accompanied by the joining of civil and ecclesiastical authority to persecute those through whom such Miracles occur we see in America today when you say the word Christian or Evangelical Christian it's become not a description of a person's Faith it's become a political label oh you're a Christian you're a Maga Republican that's that's what you that's that's they're synonyms right it's all political who knows where that might lead anyway let's see where this goes oh we're back to the scorecard preaching to the Ethiopian and the territory of Judea gives evidence for filling the third part of Jesus command or prophecy being his witness in Judea Matthew Mark the third one okay well let's continue reading as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see look here's water what does Center be to be baptized this is likely summer maybe there was a recent Monsoon you don't find standing water and the Sinai and the Negev in this part of the world you do not find pools of water just sitting there saying come here and be baptized this is unusual it gets his attention so at and and when did when do they pass this scarce body of water is it just the right time and the waters in just the right place after Philip has explained to him the right the need the importance of water baptism that that wasn't anything that they read in Isaiah but Philip has been preaching with for this guy he's been sharing with and they've been on the road for a while here so Philip responds he says if you believe with all your heart you can be baptized and and the unique answers he says I believe Jesus Christ and he the Ethiopian treasurer commanded the Chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both Philip and the eunuch and Philip baptized and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away Philip there was there was some Revival that was happening here at the eunuch saw him no more now we can interpret that many ways but but the Ethiopian went on his way rejoicing I I think probably rejoicing too but wait a minute there's something else going on here let's get back to that scorecard given the large and ancient Christian presence in Ethiopia even today it would seem the eunuch was a faithful witness well taught in his brief encounter with Philip and no doubt enlightened by the Holy Spirit as he continued to read Isaiah 53 one of the foundational chapters about the Messiah Jesus Christ so the gospel is now on its way to the uttermost part of the earth as they knew it in their day the man himself was from that other most part so either way whether he's carrying it down there or whether the witness that he had there in Judea to this man acts 1 8 is fulfilled Matthew whoa all the boxes are checked where's Jesus it's 1977. we're ready for the second coming hmm meanwhile Philip was found at azotus what's another name for ashdod it's not very far away and passing through Philip preached in all the cities till he came to caesarea now let's look at the map we see a zotus here it's just above Gaza the road where they were at and then the Bold arrow is showing going up the coast there from ashdod he goes to caesarea he's going home and and Philip lives in caesarea which is in the northern boundary of Samaria so he's going up that entire Coast so some of the disciples might have said well well but Jesus said all of Judea well yeah he's just pretty well covered all of it and it's covered a lot of Samaria as well so all these boxes are checked now we're going to meet Philip again it'll be in Acts 21. so you're gonna have to stay tuned for a while if the musicians would please return oh yeah it's still well before midnight okay meanwhile what can we take away from chapter eight that might help us in our lives today first we can expect resistance opposition not only from Outsiders second don't think that if this or that is fulfilled or the boxes are checked on your particular checklist for Jesus to return or that some box that's on your list hasn't been checked that Jesus can't come back until that box is checked on your understanding or interpretation so many years after the flag is raised in Israel a certain number of years after some vague reference in Daniel or Revelation waiting for some sort of pressure to force us to get along with each other above all our focus should be on our relationship with the law we've seen that example with Stephen we've seen that example with Philip doing what he wants us to do Jesus never said depart from me your Revelation about when I would come was wrong he said depart from me I never knew you it's relationship I'll paraphrase what brother Branham said in many places I was going to look up several of these quotes and put them up and I started to but then I thought I don't need to read quotes to prove what he said group of people have the Holy Spirit they'll know if what I'm saying is true or not so I'm going to paraphrase if you know that Jesus is coming this afternoon and your house has a leaky roof let them find you fixing the roof if you're a farmer let them find you hoe in your spuds or planting your wheat look for him every day you ready don't stop doing what you're doing unless it's sin keep reaching out to the Lost he called it being at your post of Duty a way I've expressed it most of my life is this live a simple humble Christian Life looking for the coming of the Lord live your life like he's coming today plan your life like you won't come for a hundred years my brothers and my sisters if our hearts are right if we're doing what he wants us to do he'll sort out all the rest don't be distracted by trying to figure things out setting dates a list of conditions or whatever humble Christians living a life worthy of the Gospel keep your eyes on Jesus now I hope you're not getting tired of singing It's the life behind the name it seems to me it's so applicable to this chapter of Acts that I'd like us to sing it together and again please it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes the proud part of the Lord it was God who devised a plan that in all things as a man he would win so he could care give us the life behind the name let's sing it again is our pastor comes to closest service it's the life behind my name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble it was God who devised the plan added all things as a man he would live so he could give give us a life behind the name did you appreciate that [Applause] I always get something answered I've always liked to study this word and when brother Lyle ministers I always get something it seems like that I thought about my whole life that he and and not only does he answer it anybody can just get up here and say something but the lion brings it back to the scriptures he says look at this and look at this and that is why this and there was a number of those things today one of those things was who was this man Philip it always bothered me I I always thought that he was one of these seven Deacons because it just matches up in the scripture but I could never prove it and and I thought wow I guess it could have been one of the 12 disciples but uh brother a while nice job and showing who this man was but I also touched on something and I I want I want to just go a little bit deeper in this brother Lyle was talking about how this Ethiopian great man he had a copy of the Scrolls and he was reading the Greek form the Septuagint he was reading the Greek form of the Hebrew original writings and brother Lyle proved that I want to tell you I want to show you something about the King James Bible that maybe you didn't know you go over to verse 28. it says this I can just read it to you was returning and sitting in his Chariot read essayists the prophet that word essayist that's Isaiah but that is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Isaiah you in other places you'll see you'll see Elias for like in the in the New Testament or in the Gospels it says well we thought Elias was to come first that word Elias is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Elijah the King James Bible it preserves that so if you read the King James you can see that the original language that this book of Acts was written because it says isais and not Isaiah is Greek and if you go to the book of Hebrews and you go from Hebrews on to Jude you'll see those names are no longer in the Greek but they're Elijah and Isaiah they're in the Hebrew so those after after Hebrews are the original language was either air Aramaic or Hebrew it was it was the original language of Hebrew so my point in saying you can see the target audience the target audience in most of the New Testament was the Gentiles was the common language of Greek and I like when brother Lyle he'll he'll he'll tell us those little things and it just it helps me to understand he didn't talk about that part but I just wanted to point that out to you in your King James Bible that you can see that and you can see that oh that original language here because it says is Greek a little bit of trivia God bless let's stand one more time it's a life behind it's a life behind the name that makes it was God who devised the plan that in all things [Applause] [Music] further Silas if you'd make your way up and his brother Silas is making his way up to close and also brother Lyle had an underlying theme in his lesson today and it was it was really beautiful how brother Lyle said that he had that score card up there and wow what an important lesson that we can see how many times and I just got penned out a couple weeks ago by somebody who had all the revelation of the Book of Daniel and this plus this plus this equals this minus that times this equals this equals two years from now or whatever it was Brethren the Lord Jesus warned us not to do that he said he says his brother Lyle said he'd be he said be ready all the time I remember when I was a kid thinking well when I see California sink and I see all these earthquakes happen then I'll stop being a sinner and that's just not it's not the way to do it and I've heard other people say that well when I see the dead in Christ rise when I see my mom or or my dad or my husband or my wife or whoever it might be when I see that person come to me then I'll know it's time and then I'll get ready no you won't you won't see them if you're not ready you get ready before that Resurrection you get ready before that scorecard is filled out all the way and then you'll see it amen God bless you brothers and sister brother you should come for the Silas [Music] let's bow our heads Lord we thank you so much for the message that we've heard tonight and just ask us to write this book in our hearts Lord this book of Acts it's not just acts of the people

I asked brother Daniel if they could pray for me I've been having problems in my stomach for the last three months or so and everything I eat you seems to go through not too sure so ask him I could be
