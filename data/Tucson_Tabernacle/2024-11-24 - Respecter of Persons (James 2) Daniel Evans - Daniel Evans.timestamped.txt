[31:41] paper over this past week I mentioned
[31:42] them last week and I said quite a bit

[31:50] be failing if if I didn't say something
[31:53] I know that you all have said we don't
[31:56] care
[31:58] and and I do appreciate that it really
[32:00] made me feel good I told Brother Lyall
[32:02] that after service last
[32:04] Sunday I I said I said man brother L I
[32:08] said you know what made me feel so good
[32:11] about the congregation is that they
[32:14] really I could tell they really don't
[32:15] care these these things coming out and
[32:19] and it's like we're not we're not part
[32:22] of that and and we just stand with what
[32:26] we believe we we stand with Jesus Christ
[32:29] and him crucified and and we acknowledge
[32:32] that God has done a great work in this
[32:34] day and we just continue on we continue
[32:37] on with with uh serving the lord but I
[32:41] want to also reme have the congregation
[32:44] remember and the reason I am saying this
[32:46] as many of you have come from these
[32:50] churches that are mentioned in these
[32:53] articles and all of you can testify that
[32:58] these words that are written are written
[33:01] about from written about real
[33:05] people and it's easy for us to
[33:07] stereotype a group of people or a church
[33:10] but we have to remember that these are
[33:13] real Flesh and Blood people and they
[33:16] have
[33:17] feelings they have thoughts on things
[33:20] they have the many of them I'm sure are
[33:23] embarrassed about these articles and
[33:25] they may disagree with them but it's
[33:27] still it's an embarrass inter in thing
[33:28] when when you put people up on the on
[33:31] the front page of the paper and and then
[33:34] negative things are said about them
[33:35] whether those negative things are true
[33:37] or false it's still it it hurts and
[33:41] remember these people on both sides
[33:43] remember to pray for them and always
[33:45] reach out a right hand of Fellowship to
[33:47] them and and love
[33:49] them
[33:52] ultimately we have to realize that each
[33:54] one of these people they have a soul
[33:58] and God cares about that Soul that's
[34:01] what's important to him never stereotype
[34:04] people brothers and sisters and we're
[34:05] going to if we can get to our chapter in
[34:08] James today we're going to see that
[34:10] James strictly forbids that this
[34:13] stereotypical way of viewing but we look
[34:16] at ourselves and we look at that um all
[34:19] that has gone on in this past week and
[34:21] we know that there are scriptures like
[34:23] Romans 8 verse 28 that says that all
[34:27] these things they all work together for
[34:30] the good to those who love God and to
[34:33] those who are called according to his
[34:35] purpose so these things are good and
[34:38] they they are working out for the good
[34:40] and this
[34:42] situation should be a time of
[34:46] reflection that we look at at what's
[34:50] going on and and what's said and as Paul
[34:53] said he said let a man examine
[34:55] himself we should exam examine ourselves
[34:59] as should every everyone Lord are my
[35:04] beliefs are my doctrines are they right
[35:08] according to your word and I I got to
[35:10] tell you I I've been a bit
[35:12] disappointed with some of the
[35:15] responses that have
[35:17] come um on well actually I've been
[35:20] disappointed on both sides and I think
[35:22] both sides everything in these articles
[35:24] I think has been
[35:25] misrepresented it's been misrepresented
[35:27] from the certain people that I know of
[35:30] now the people I don't know of I can't
[35:32] speak for them
[35:34] exaggerating and being a a a victim when
[35:38] they're not a
[35:39] victim and then other thing other on the
[35:43] other side
[35:45] representing the the their beliefs these
[35:48] pastors and and spokesmen and basically
[35:50] trying to run towards the middle and say
[35:53] oh we just believe
[35:55] Jesus but brother
[35:58] you've been preaching something else for
[36:00] your whole life or you've been preaching
[36:02] something else from your church and what
[36:04] you're saying now is just a response to
[36:06] somebody calling you out to out from it
[36:10] I don't agree with that
[36:11] either I I
[36:13] don't people say that you know that they
[36:17] they say we don't excommunicate people
[36:19] you may call it by a different
[36:21] name just an exercise and semantics
[36:24] really but you do
[36:28] and they say that oh we're not a cult
[36:29] we're not a denomination we just point
[36:31] people to the Bible Well then why are we
[36:33] trying to reflect the reporter's
[36:35] questions things that you regularly
[36:37] preach from the
[36:39] pulpit and trying to just just go back
[36:42] to
[36:44] mainstream almost every comment I saw
[36:49] was trying to get oh we're just normal
[36:52] we we just we just preach Jesus Christ
[36:54] yeah but you
[36:56] don't you preach Jesus plus something
[36:59] else I
[37:01] mentioned last week that brother
[37:03] braham's name was once associated with
[37:05] great healing revivals and and ministers
[37:07] meetings where Baptists and methodists
[37:09] and Pentecostals and Catholics they
[37:11] would come together in unity and now
[37:14] it's associated with Scandal and cultish
[37:18] behavior is that brother brandom's fault
[37:21] or have those who have followed his
[37:23] teachings M
[37:25] misrepresented him through Doctrine
[37:29] derived from his sermons that have
[37:31] nothing that have done nothing but
[37:34] caused Division and sometimes
[37:39] worse it's behaviors like telling your
[37:43] congregation stay away from church stay
[37:46] home listen to the tapes rather than
[37:48] fellowshipping rather than bringing your
[37:50] gift into the church and contributing to
[37:52] the church just stay home just be quiet
[37:54] and just sit there and and hold up in
[37:56] your house and just listen to a tape
[37:59] show me where show me where in the word
[38:02] of God or where where William brandom
[38:03] ever taught anything like that it's
[38:06] nonsense or their be behaviors like
[38:07] shunning people taking them out from
[38:09] under the blood when they disobey the
[38:11] teachings of the local
[38:13] church as I said they may put some other
[38:16] label on it that's just
[38:19] semantics but you do preach those things
[38:23] and those things do go
[38:26] beyond what has been taught in this word
[38:28] and they're constantly preaching about
[38:30] dress codes and about trying to get
[38:32] everyone to look exactly alike and then
[38:35] when the reporter ass oh they just
[38:36] downplay it oh no no no we're just
[38:38] normal but you do preach those things
[38:40] that do go beyond modesty and they do go
[38:42] beyond
[38:44] Holiness even speaking a
[38:47] language that people that are Christians
[38:50] they can't even understand it I've been
[38:54] I've been to be when we came here
[38:58] Stephanie and I moved here tried to go
[39:00] to
[39:01] every message church and some others
[39:04] just like Lord where do you want us
[39:06] where do you want us to go where is the
[39:08] place that would that would that that we
[39:11] could help and that would would benefit
[39:13] us and our families and and I went to a
[39:17] church that listen I was born in brother
[39:20] Brown's message if you listen to tapes
[39:22] you know who my family is I went to a
[39:25] church I had no idea what they were
[39:26] talking about
[39:28] saying things that that they mentioned
[39:31] William they mentioned brother brandom's
[39:32] name and then saying saying all these
[39:34] things it's like it's like what are you
[39:36] I don't I don't understand I don't
[39:38] understand these these ways of speaking
[39:40] it doesn't make sense to
[39:42] me and we do the same thing brother we
[39:45] got the UN unadulterated word of God
[39:48] spoken by the seventh angel messenger
[39:49] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[39:50] children hearts of children to the
[39:51] fathers and father and and call a bride
[39:54] out of the church to the third pole and
[39:55] return Ministry what
[39:58] what does this have to do with
[39:59] Jesus and you see so many people they
[40:02] just say brother I just want to give my
[40:04] heart to
[40:05] Christ I just want to change my way of
[40:08] living amen I I just want to I want to
[40:11] come I want I want to do like this Bible
[40:13] says I want to I want to have the same
[40:15] benefits that are promised in this Bible
[40:17] what are you talking
[40:20] about you need to ask yourself we need
[40:23] to ask
[40:24] ourself that when some of these things
[40:27] are brought up and I
[40:30] believe that these articles as I said I
[40:34] don't like them I think it's wrong all
[40:37] the way
[40:37] around but we have to ask
[40:41] ourselves Lord what about me what about
[40:44] the way I think and so many times you
[40:47] hear from the pulpit you got to just
[40:48] believe you got to just have faith you
[40:49] got to just just accept as a truth wait
[40:51] a minute It also says to work out your
[40:54] own salvation through fear and trembling
[40:56] you need to make sure that you are
[40:59] right we need to make sure we believe
[41:02] right there needs to be a
[41:05] self-reflection and if you claim to
[41:07] believe the
[41:08] prophet and you follow his teachings
[41:11] maybe you should look yourself in the in
[41:13] the mirror that I mentioned in James
[41:15] chapter 1 and see if you're actually
[41:18] following what he taught or has the
[41:20] ministry changed so drastically over the
[41:23] past 60 years that it's not even
[41:25] recognizable if he would return today
[41:28] would he even
[41:30] recognize what's being preached or would
[41:32] he even recognize what the what the
[41:34] people are propagating what the people
[41:36] look like he would he even do that you
[41:37] have to ask yourselves I'm not answering
[41:39] the question I'm saying that you have to
[41:43] ask that and it's always when when these
[41:46] type of things rise up and it's it's
[41:48] throughout history it's always Christ
[41:52] plus
[41:53] something it always seems to be that
[41:56] that the in the addition we believe in
[41:59] Jesus but there's something more let me
[42:02] tell
[42:03] you that man Jesus
[42:07] Christ the Bible said that he is the
[42:11] express image of God so you look at
[42:15] Jesus Christ you are seeing the one that
[42:17] created the heavens and the Earth you're
[42:19] seeing the Alpha and the Omega you are
[42:21] seeing that Elohim that self that all
[42:24] existing one you are seeing God in flesh
[42:29] and when you say just get them to Christ
[42:31] and then introduce them to something
[42:33] else what exactly are you going to
[42:35] introduce them that is better than
[42:39] Jesus you got to be
[42:41] careful there is nothing greater than
[42:44] Jesus Christ now I might want to
[42:46] introduce them to something that will
[42:48] get them to that man that's good I might
[42:51] want to introduce them to something that
[42:54] will help them get healed if they're
[42:55] sick that shows that Jesus Christ is
[42:58] alive today I will introduce them to
[43:00] something like that amen but the
[43:02] ultimate destination is to get them to
[43:05] Jesus Christ who is God God
[43:09] himself the prophets role you're saying
[43:11] well what about the prophets we should
[43:13] believe the prophets the prophet's role
[43:15] is to represent God to point the people
[43:19] is is to take a message that God gave
[43:21] them and the point the people back to
[43:25] God
[43:27] and since God was manifested in human
[43:30] flesh it is their role to point people
[43:34] to
[43:36] Christ there's a a Buddhist
[43:40] saying if someone is pointing at the
[43:43] Moon to show you the
[43:46] moon don't mistake the finger that is
[43:49] pointing at the moon for the
[43:52] moon and if
[43:54] I or anyone else is pointing you to this
[43:58] cross don't look at my
[44:00] finger look at what my finger is
[44:02] pointing at and it's this cross and it's
[44:05] it's the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:09] and I as I said I was disappointed very
[44:12] disappointed and and all the way around
[44:15] and it reminded me of the Mormons the
[44:17] Mormons over the past 15
[44:19] years they've the church has tried to
[44:22] move towards mainstream saying that
[44:25] they're Christians
[44:27] you
[44:28] know it's
[44:30] easy to
[44:32] see that the Mormon
[44:35] religion teaches extra biblical things
[44:39] and they're qu quick to say that we
[44:41] believe God sent a prophet to straighten
[44:42] out the apostasy that happened after the
[44:45] original
[44:47] disciples and that they what they
[44:49] neglect to say is that their core
[44:51] Doctrine comes from The Book of
[44:54] Mormon and not the Bible
[44:57] but when they're called out they're
[44:58] quick to point back to Jesus no no no no
[45:01] we're Christians but you're Christ plus
[45:04] something El joah witness the same thing
[45:06] they're seeing they're quick to say that
[45:07] they are Christians and they believe
[45:08] Jesus to be the Messiah but they take
[45:11] their Watchtower
[45:13] Publications and their own
[45:16] interpretation over the original text of
[45:19] the Bible and when they're called out
[45:20] they're Qui say oh no no no no we're
[45:23] Christians to to witness about Christ
[45:25] but then but there's something more
[45:26] there is nothing more brothers and
[45:29] sisters we've got it backwards so never
[45:32] say oh we appreciate what the Tucson
[45:34] Tabernacle is doing what brother Daniel
[45:35] Evans is doing he's getting them to
[45:37] Christ and then introducing to the
[45:39] message no no no no Christ is the
[45:42] ultimate
[45:44] destination he is God he is
[45:47] everything and I can show you that he's
[45:51] alive I can show you not only with what
[45:54] he's doing today I can show you what
[45:56] with with what he did 50 60 years ago 70
[45:58] years ago he is a mighty God and he
[46:01] changes
[46:03] not you say well oh well what about you
[46:08] as I said they it's it's quick when you
[46:11] get called out it's quick to try to go
[46:13] to the middle and it's quick no no no no
[46:15] we're we're not weird we're not
[46:19] different but you ask me it's like well
[46:22] is this
[46:24] exclusive you know or or is it just one
[46:26] one group of people that get to go to
[46:28] heaven
[46:30] yes Jesus said I am the way the truth
[46:33] and the life and no man can come to the
[46:35] father except by
[46:36] me does that cut out anyone that doesn't
[46:40] believe in Jesus
[46:42] Christ I don't know I'm not the judge
[46:44] but it looks like it
[46:46] does it's what Jesus
[46:49] said Jesus said you search the
[46:51] scriptures and for in them you think you
[46:52] have eternal life and these are they
[46:54] which testify of me but you're not
[46:56] willing to come to me that you may have
[47:01] life scripture you're not willing to
[47:03] come to me that you might have
[47:05] life you have to have Christ
[47:09] plus and the plus ends up being more
[47:12] important in
[47:15] Christ yeah I
[47:17] believe the gospel I believe eternal
[47:20] life is exclusive to Jesus Christ and
[47:23] his abl um blood atonement I believe
[47:27] that a woman should Adorn herself in
[47:28] modest apparel with shamefacedness and
[47:30] sobriety not with gold or pearls or
[47:32] costly I believe that you know why I
[47:34] believe
[47:35] it because it's in the Bible don't
[47:37] criticize me for that that's
[47:40] Paul it's right it's right here yes I
[47:43] believe in what Jesus said he said I
[47:46] will know my I will know my disciples
[47:50] for your love one one for
[47:54] another I believe what he said
[47:57] I believe Christians should be one he
[48:00] didn't separate he said there'd be one
[48:02] Shepherd and one
[48:04] fault and I believe that Christians
[48:06] should be one I believe
[48:09] that I believe and I I fall short as as
[48:13] everyone does but I also believe that
[48:16] Jesus said if you love me keep my
[48:20] commandments so we should be doing
[48:21] everything that we can to keep his
[48:23] Commandments not just what what Jesus
[48:26] said but I believe this Bible is all of
[48:28] his
[48:29] Commandments but
[48:31] instead you
[48:33] know to be a True Believer you got to
[48:35] have the Bible
[48:37] plus brothers and sisters let me tell
[48:39] you that's not what my Bible says it
[48:41] says don't add anything to it I'm taking
[48:44] anything away from it and that's not
[48:46] what brother random said
[48:49] either and the the Catholics they are
[48:52] the most
[48:53] bold with it because there's over a
[48:55] billion of them and they're quick to
[48:57] tell you they're so good they're quick
[48:59] to tell you I'm not Christian I'm
[49:01] Catholic but they'll still claim Christ
[49:04] they're just more advanced in their
[49:07] progression for them it's Christ plus
[49:12] Mary Christ plus Peter Christ plus the
[49:17] papal Authority plus the authority of
[49:20] the church over the
[49:22] word it's the same Spirit where they
[49:25] interpret the Bible to match their
[49:27] beliefs rather than changing their
[49:29] beliefs to match the
[49:31] Bible you can write that one
[49:35] down it's where they interpret the Bible
[49:37] to match their beliefs rather than
[49:40] changing their beliefs to match the
[49:43] Bible and the division doesn't come from
[49:47] Christ the division comes from additions
[49:51] to Christ many of the churches and the
[49:53] ones I mentioned in the new newspaper
[49:55] they claim to be these things but
[49:58] sometimes I believe that they're more
[50:00] Catholic than the pope
[50:01] is where you have to believe it this way
[50:05] and we have authority to add to it you
[50:06] don't have authority to add to it listen
[50:10] this I was uh saw this article I was
[50:13] telling uh Dylan yesterday that um just
[50:17] now that um his name his baby's name is
[50:19] Jubilee and and the pope he uh
[50:22] proclaimed a year a holy year or
[50:25] something like that so and I saw it on
[50:27] the headline so I I flipped down I
[50:29] didn't read the article I just wanted to
[50:30] go to the comments um which is
[50:33] often by the way my sermon last Sunday I
[50:36] started getting all these negative
[50:37] comments I just shut them down we we
[50:40] turn the comments off on YouTube for
[50:42] that one I I'll turn them back on but I
[50:44] mean what good does it do you know but
[50:46] but listen to some of these comments on
[50:48] Fox news for this um article on the pope
[50:52] proclaiming this it's a bit of a benign
[50:54] thing but it says
[50:57] this uh this is one this I'll go through
[51:00] a lot of the comments it says for there
[51:02] is one God and one mediator between God
[51:04] and Mankind the man Christ Jesus it's
[51:06] not the
[51:08] pope and then the ne the response I
[51:10] guess you don't pray to God on behalf of
[51:12] your family and loved on since you can't
[51:14] be a mediator it's
[51:17] sad so Jesus I'm not saying these aren't
[51:21] my words so Jesus was wrong and an error
[51:23] when he formed the Catholic Church your
[51:25] Jesus is weak mine and per mine is
[51:29] perfect next comment is you're
[51:30] absolutely correct amen
[51:33] hallelujah then the next one no one says
[51:36] it was the
[51:39] pope next comment Jesus said call no man
[51:42] father and then the next comment another
[51:44] worm trying to outsmart Jesus who
[51:46] bestowed upon Peter The Rock and the
[51:48] keys to the kingdom of heaven so
[51:50] tiresome and ancient reminds me of The
[51:52] Wretched scribes who rejected Jesus the
[51:55] Galilean because they ass assume he
[51:57] couldn't have been born in Bethlehem
[51:59] search the
[52:00] scriptures then the next one spot on and
[52:03] the next one read Matthew 16:18
[52:08] heretic then the next one funny how any
[52:12] mention of religion or spirituality
[52:13] brings out vile haters like a starting
[52:16] Bell at a horse
[52:18] race next one Cults you
[52:20] mean then the then the next in next one
[52:23] it says it brings out rabid
[52:25] anti-catholic Protestants as much as
[52:28] liberals poor poor schismatics jump off
[52:31] the bus and how they hate and how and
[52:35] now hate those that stayed on it's like
[52:39] man anti-catholic Protestants and
[52:42] liberals man they compared me to a
[52:46] liberal
[52:48] Ridiculousness and this is religion of
[52:52] today and we see it right back down at
[52:54] home brothers and sisters our words
[52:56] should always be positive our words
[52:59] should always be pointing to Christ and
[53:01] if they don't there's something there's
[53:03] something
[53:06] wrong mahat MC Gandhi you all know who
[53:08] that is the skinny Hindu guy that um he
[53:13] uh you know he stood against he he he
[53:17] stood against
[53:18] um
[53:20] uh war and stuff he was a good man he
[53:23] did great things he stood against war
[53:25] and he stood against um of the cast
[53:27] system in India uh really he was he was
[53:30] and he did great things and and Gandhi
[53:33] when he was
[53:34] younger he started reading the
[53:40] gospels and he started looking into
[53:44] Christianity and he said this is really
[53:49] something and he must have seen where
[53:51] where where that that Jesus said if
[53:54] somebody smacks you on this on the side
[53:56] of the face turn the other cheek and and
[53:58] let him smack that side and if you call
[54:00] someone a fool you're in danger of going
[54:02] to hell and if you look at someone who
[54:05] is not your spouse in a lustful way with
[54:08] a desire for that person rather than
[54:10] your spouse then you are guilty of
[54:12] adultery in your heart if your right
[54:15] hand causes you to sin cut it off for it
[54:18] would be
[54:19] better to lose your
[54:21] hand in this
[54:23] life than to perish in h in H now gny
[54:28] must have loved the discipline of Jesus
[54:30] Christ as he studied these gospels he
[54:32] read things like the tradition tradition
[54:36] has said that you should love your
[54:37] neighbor neighbor and hate your enemy
[54:39] but I say unto you love your enemies and
[54:41] bless them that curse you do good to
[54:43] them that hate you and pray for them
[54:45] which despitefully use you and persecute
[54:48] you that you may be the children of your
[54:50] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[54:51] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[54:53] good and since reigned on the just and
[54:55] the unjust G he must have looked at
[54:57] these words of of Jesus and must have
[55:00] said in his heart this is it this is
[55:03] what I've been looking
[55:04] for Christ teaches that everyone is
[55:07] equal in the size of God no matter the
[55:08] race or the cast or their appearance
[55:11] Christ wants all of them together in
[55:13] peace and in unity and quit pointing
[55:16] your finger at the other
[55:18] guy and he
[55:20] saw this Jesus Christ in the Bible and
[55:23] he was looking and reading about this
[55:25] and he saw that this is it this is
[55:28] something so he said I'm going to go to
[55:32] church one Sunday
[55:34] morning he visited a Christian Church in
[55:39] Kolkata walked in I got this this um
[55:44] story from um the
[55:48] uh the um Kansas City newspaper and you
[55:52] can always believe what the newspapers
[55:55] say I'm kidding on that one but um he
[56:00] came to this Sunday Sunday morning
[56:03] church and he walked in they looked at
[56:08] him they looked at him up and
[56:11] down and said uh
[56:15] no you're not part of
[56:18] us you're not dressed like us you don't
[56:21] look like us you don't talk like us
[56:23] you're not some from the same cast as us
[56:27] us you can go and beond your way it
[56:30] wouldn't allow him into the
[56:35] church because of that
[56:37] rejection muhamad Gandhi never he turned
[56:41] his back on Christianity and he never
[56:44] came
[56:45] back because of the way that that one
[56:47] Church in Kolkata treated
[56:50] him I read this quote with this act
[56:53] Gandhi rejected the Christian faith
[56:55] never began to consider the claims of
[56:59] Christ he was turned off by the sin of
[57:01] the of the segregation that was
[57:03] practiced by the church and it was due
[57:06] to this experience that Gandhi later
[57:09] declared I'd be a Christian if it were
[57:13] not for the
[57:15] Christians what a
[57:17] shame what a
[57:20] shame when it comes down to
[57:23] it when someone enters the church
[57:26] congregation or your fellowship or
[57:27] whatever it
[57:29] is the question is always asked in our
[57:32] mind do you look like me do you believe
[57:33] like me do you act like me and if not
[57:37] how can I make you more like
[57:39] me instead
[57:41] of how can you make how can I make you
[57:44] how can I make myself more like the one
[57:46] who died on the
[57:47] cross that's what should be thought but
[57:50] our minds and we all do it our minds are
[57:53] thinking how can I make you look more
[57:55] like me or act more like
[57:57] me as I said it's it's always Jesus
[58:02] plus
[58:05] and never and we can't we can't even
[58:09] imagine how great Jesus
[58:12] is we can't even
[58:14] imagine how the one who created the
[58:16] heavens and the Earth as I said the
[58:18] express image of God Jesus Christ
[58:21] himself he's even what God looks like
[58:26] so you want to introduce people to him
[58:29] and according to James you are not
[58:32] special he's
[58:35] special and we're special because we
[58:38] believe him in him and looking on the
[58:41] outside app parents is what we're going
[58:42] to get to in the first verses in James
[58:47] 2 you're looking at the outside
[58:50] appearance 1st Samuel
[58:52] 16:7 this is when Samuel the prophet was
[58:55] choosing
[58:56] the successor to King
[58:59] Saul and um Jesse had eight
[59:04] Sons brought the first one there he he
[59:06] thought that that was going to be the
[59:07] one and then Samuel disregards him goes
[59:13] through all of the top seven of
[59:16] eight and God God refused every one of
[59:20] them until he got to the last one David
[59:23] and it didn't make sense in Samuel's
[59:25] mind
[59:26] it didn't make sense in Jesse's mind it
[59:28] didn't make sense in anybody's mind why
[59:30] would you choose this one this is the
[59:31] best looking the be the most well spoken
[59:34] the the as a pastor would be the most um
[59:37] the most learned and
[59:39] educated 1st Samuel
[59:43] 16:7 says that
[59:46] man I'll read the whole thing but the
[59:48] Lord said unto Samuel look not on his
[59:51] countenance or on the height of his
[59:52] stature because I have refused him for
[59:56] for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for
[59:59] man lookth on the outward appearance but
[1:00:01] the Lord looks on the
[1:00:05] heart James chapter
[1:00:07] 2 there's two themes in this chapter
[1:00:10] there's one is don't show
[1:00:13] favoritism and the second one is to put
[1:00:15] faith in action I don't know if we'll
[1:00:17] get through the whole chapter but we'll
[1:00:19] go as time
[1:00:22] allows chapter 2 verse one my brethren
[1:00:26] have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus
[1:00:28] Christ the lord of G Glory with respect
[1:00:30] of
[1:00:32] persons the Lord Of
[1:00:35] Glory we I don't even I can't even get
[1:00:37] past that first that first phrase the
[1:00:39] Lord Of Glory the Glorious the Glorious
[1:00:42] Lord this one that rules over all the
[1:00:46] glory this is have not the Faith of Our
[1:00:50] Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory he's
[1:00:53] saying how great this man Jesus Christ
[1:00:55] is
[1:00:56] with respect to
[1:00:58] persons he's saying how can you even
[1:01:00] have faith in Jesus Christ if you prefer
[1:01:04] one person over the other usually as
[1:01:09] pastor and you know my Ministry I try to
[1:01:11] bring some correction to our
[1:01:14] congregation but I want to brag on our
[1:01:16] congre congregation here I want to tell
[1:01:19] you that I believe that this
[1:01:23] congregation is very good and treating
[1:01:27] everyone equal if you see somebody come
[1:01:30] in that you don't know I love the way
[1:01:32] that everybody's willing to shake their
[1:01:33] hand ask them where they're from talk to
[1:01:36] them it doesn't matter how they look I
[1:01:39] was last night we had the kids in the
[1:01:42] upper room and there was somebody out in
[1:01:45] the front of the church and I you know I
[1:01:47] was like well I'm going to go kick him
[1:01:48] out like I always do I walked out there
[1:01:50] as this man sitting there that I didn't
[1:01:53] recognize and he's he's sitting there
[1:01:55] and I said hey man this is private
[1:01:57] property and he says
[1:01:59] uh hey
[1:02:01] Pastor and I was like hi he says I'm
[1:02:06] Carlos he
[1:02:08] said I go to the I go to the church he
[1:02:12] says I come in and I I sit in the back
[1:02:14] he says do you know Arie
[1:02:15] Peterson I said yeah something that all
[1:02:18] the homeless people say by the
[1:02:20] way he said that's a great compliment on
[1:02:25] my friend yeah he said' do you know Arie
[1:02:27] Peterson I said yeah he said he's a very
[1:02:29] kind man he says no I come in and I sit
[1:02:33] in the back and he says I want to tell
[1:02:36] you that every time I come
[1:02:38] in he said I feel the presence of the
[1:02:43] Lord and he says you all are so nice and
[1:02:46] he said he says I really feel that God
[1:02:48] is with you and he says I just I'm
[1:02:50] looking for him right now I don't I
[1:02:52] don't see him come on Carlos let me down
[1:02:55] man
[1:02:57] but he he said that God is in that
[1:03:02] place
[1:03:04] and made me think back to what I'm
[1:03:07] preaching on right
[1:03:09] now that God is not a respector of
[1:03:11] persons that man that was sitting on the
[1:03:14] porch there has a soul that's worth
[1:03:16] 10,000 worlds a soul that's worth
[1:03:18] greater than anything that could ever H
[1:03:21] anything that could ever come from a
[1:03:23] rich man or or or a government or
[1:03:25] anything like that that soul is worth
[1:03:29] everything and he loves this place turns
[1:03:33] out he isn't homeless at all turns out
[1:03:37] that he got in a fight with his
[1:03:39] girlfriend and she kicked him out and um
[1:03:43] he was doing what the world has for you
[1:03:45] which is which is uh just hard times and
[1:03:49] uh he's going to be able to get himself
[1:03:52] straight so I was able to give him a
[1:03:53] little bit to help him and we had pizza
[1:03:55] upstairs so I brought him down some
[1:03:56] pizza and and I may have just sealed my
[1:04:01] eternal
[1:04:02] salvation by helping that one man who I
[1:04:05] believe is a child of
[1:04:06] God I saw brother Joel there as I said I
[1:04:10] bought a lot of stock in you so don't
[1:04:11] let me
[1:04:13] down I was driving down the highway I
[1:04:16] don't know a year ago or
[1:04:18] so and uh I'm cruising along and I see
[1:04:22] brother Joe's vehicle out there I
[1:04:25] believe is his van he's got his kids in
[1:04:27] there and and there's brother Joe out
[1:04:29] there and he's helping somebody change a
[1:04:31] tire a
[1:04:33] lady so I I pull in behind him and and I
[1:04:36] offer my help and I asked brother Joe I
[1:04:39] said um I said so who is this I just saw
[1:04:42] her beside the road and I just stopped
[1:04:45] to
[1:04:46] help and she didn't know what she was
[1:04:48] doing she didn't know how to change
[1:04:49] attire but there's God sent his
[1:04:52] angel in the form of Joe Robson and his
[1:04:56] family and there they are just helping
[1:04:58] somebody later on we won't get to it
[1:05:01] probably today but but James says you
[1:05:04] show me faith without works he said I
[1:05:06] show you my faith by my
[1:05:08] works right there it doesn't it didn't
[1:05:11] matter who she was it didn't matter what
[1:05:13] church that she was part of if she was a
[1:05:15] Christian or she wasn't a Christian he
[1:05:16] was there to
[1:05:20] help verse number
[1:05:23] two for there come unto your assembly a
[1:05:25] man with a gold ring in goodly apparel
[1:05:28] and there come in also a poor man in
[1:05:30] Vile reignment and you have respect to
[1:05:32] him that weareth the gay clothing and
[1:05:34] say unto him sit thou here in a good
[1:05:36] place and say to the poor stand thou
[1:05:39] there or sit under here under my foot
[1:05:43] stol are ye not then partial in
[1:05:46] yourselves and become judges of evil
[1:05:49] thoughts the Amplified version of
[1:05:52] that scripture says have you not discri
[1:05:55] rated among yourselves and become judges
[1:05:58] with wrong
[1:06:01] motives what is it's Prejudice is what
[1:06:04] it is and what is
[1:06:07] Prejudice
[1:06:10] pre-judging prejudging someone by what
[1:06:12] they look like prejudging someone from
[1:06:15] where they come from pre-judging
[1:06:20] someone and not doing what a Christian
[1:06:24] should do
[1:06:26] which is putting out the right hand of
[1:06:27] Fellowship to
[1:06:29] whoever hearken my beloved Brethren hath
[1:06:33] not God chosen the poor of this world
[1:06:35] rich in faith and Hees of the Kingdom
[1:06:37] which he hath promised to them that love
[1:06:40] him and it's not that you've treated the
[1:06:44] rich too good it's not that you've
[1:06:47] treated the Believers too
[1:06:51] good but it's that you haven't treated
[1:06:54] the others good
[1:06:56] enough maybe because they weren't
[1:06:58] important
[1:06:59] enough as I said Samuel said for the
[1:07:02] Lord Lord seeth not as a man
[1:07:05] seeth the man look looks on the outward
[1:07:08] appearance but the Lord looks on the
[1:07:14] heart verse number six but you have
[1:07:16] despised the poor do not rich man
[1:07:19] impress you and draw you before the
[1:07:20] Judgment seats do they not blaspheme the
[1:07:23] worthy Name by which you are called
[1:07:26] if you fulfill the Royal law according
[1:07:29] to the scripture Thou shalt love thy
[1:07:31] neighbor as thyself you do well he says
[1:07:34] the Royal law now we got to remember
[1:07:37] from from last week remember who James
[1:07:39] is James is the pastor of the church at
[1:07:43] Jerusalem he's also Jesus's half brother
[1:07:47] probably the same mother definitely a
[1:07:49] different
[1:07:50] father and here he
[1:07:52] is and he was with
[1:07:56] Jesus growing up when they were kids
[1:07:59] James was there can you imagine how that
[1:08:01] was being a brother of Jesus my brothers
[1:08:04] were always doing stuff
[1:08:07] wrong at least I accused them of it can
[1:08:10] you imagine
[1:08:12] being a brother to
[1:08:14] Jesus and then who did this well we know
[1:08:17] it wasn't
[1:08:19] Jesus had to be one of the other
[1:08:22] brothers or
[1:08:23] sister but he knew
[1:08:25] and even being as close to Jesus as he
[1:08:28] was he recognized this man his brother
[1:08:32] as the Christ as God in flesh and he
[1:08:36] said this and and James says if you
[1:08:38] fulfill the Royal law according to the
[1:08:40] scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:08:42] as thyself you do well what is this
[1:08:46] Royal law Jesus puts special emphasis on
[1:08:51] this
[1:08:52] commandment if you could put up Matthew
[1:08:54] chapter 2 2 2:
[1:08:57] 36 says
[1:08:59] this master which is speaking to Jesus
[1:09:04] speaking to Jesus Master which is the
[1:09:07] great commandment in the law Jesus said
[1:09:09] unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[1:09:11] God with all thy heart and with all thy
[1:09:13] soul and with all thy mind we know that
[1:09:15] one this is the first and great
[1:09:17] commandment and the second is like unto
[1:09:21] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:09:26] on these two Commandments hang all the
[1:09:29] law and the prophets so here's the whole
[1:09:32] Bible which we learned from Brother
[1:09:34] Lyall the other night that the law is
[1:09:37] speaking of the
[1:09:40] word and he's saying all of it hangs on
[1:09:44] these two Commandments that you love the
[1:09:47] Lord thy God with all your heart and
[1:09:48] with all your soul and with all thy mind
[1:09:52] and the second Thou shalt love thy
[1:09:54] neighbor as thyself
[1:09:56] how important these two Commandments all
[1:10:00] of the message all of the Bible
[1:10:02] everything hangs on those two
[1:10:05] Commandments back to James
[1:10:09] 29 but if you have respect to
[1:10:12] persons you commit
[1:10:15] sin and are convinced of the law as
[1:10:18] transgress transgressors there are so
[1:10:22] many ways to sin
[1:10:25] it's not just
[1:10:26] stealing lying or murdering or sexual
[1:10:30] improprieties or drugs or any of that
[1:10:33] there are ways to sin that are not
[1:10:36] defined they're
[1:10:39] everywhere and if you show
[1:10:42] partiality to someone you are
[1:10:46] sinning and it can send you to hell as I
[1:10:50] said there's a lot of ways to sin that's
[1:10:52] one of them just showing partiality to
[1:10:55] someone I've told this story
[1:10:57] before I want to tell it again of um
[1:11:01] there's a sermon that brother bran
[1:11:04] preached it's called um Souls that are
[1:11:06] in prison now at the beginning of that
[1:11:09] sermon if you listen to the tape someone
[1:11:14] faints and brother brandom it's so sweet
[1:11:18] brother brandom um she faints and he
[1:11:23] stops the service they have prayer for
[1:11:26] then they bring the lady
[1:11:28] up and he says you know what he says
[1:11:31] take her and he he says sit her on the
[1:11:34] platform behind
[1:11:40] me
[1:11:41] and they they bring her up and he says
[1:11:43] wait a minute he says as she's going by
[1:11:45] let me just lay my hands on her this is
[1:11:48] all on the
[1:11:49] tape She lays her hands on her prays for
[1:11:52] her background on this story those was a
[1:11:55] lady lady named Shirley
[1:11:57] no and
[1:11:59] Shirley was the sister-in-law to a young
[1:12:02] man named Garnet Peak does that sound
[1:12:04] familiar brother Joe you know who that
[1:12:05] is it's a young man who got
[1:12:08] polio and he lived down near act in
[1:12:11] Kentucky which is a couple hours south
[1:12:13] of
[1:12:14] Jeffersonville and he um got polio and
[1:12:19] and it just it it really went wild
[1:12:21] through his body he ended up being in an
[1:12:23] iron lung and having having a lot of
[1:12:25] applications and he ended up dying uh
[1:12:28] from it later on dying later on and this
[1:12:33] Garnet Peak somehow he
[1:12:35] heard and he somehow he got a hold of
[1:12:38] brother brandom's tapes he would save up
[1:12:41] his child support money his dad wasn't
[1:12:43] present in his life but he had to send
[1:12:45] the money so he would save up his child
[1:12:46] support money buy these tapes and
[1:12:49] listen and he just he just loved brother
[1:12:52] Brandon brother brandham knew him and
[1:12:54] he'd get sick and
[1:12:56] start um having problems getting close
[1:12:59] to death brother brand would call they'd
[1:13:00] pray together and he'd get
[1:13:02] better and time went on well he got
[1:13:04] really really
[1:13:06] low
[1:13:08] and he
[1:13:11] um was so
[1:13:14] bad that uh Shirley who loved him
[1:13:19] everybody loved this young
[1:13:21] man and he had a great personality and
[1:13:23] really fun to be around um and he'd lay
[1:13:26] in the in the living room and he loved
[1:13:30] to just look out the window at the birds
[1:13:32] he couldn't couldn't move from his
[1:13:34] bed and he tells Shirley and her husband
[1:13:40] dorlan um would you go here would you
[1:13:44] make the trip up to Jeffersonville to
[1:13:46] hear this
[1:13:47] man and uh Shirley's like I'm not going
[1:13:51] up there there a bunch of judgmental
[1:13:53] people they are I'm I'm not going to go
[1:13:56] up there I don't I don't want any part
[1:13:57] of
[1:13:58] them and he said would you just please
[1:14:02] just go for me and come back and tell me
[1:14:04] how it
[1:14:05] was and she
[1:14:07] says all right and so her and her
[1:14:12] husband they drive up to Jeffersonville
[1:14:14] they get there to towards the late
[1:14:17] towards the beginning of service they
[1:14:18] all the all the seats were taken so she
[1:14:21] goes up and she's
[1:14:23] standing against the
[1:14:27] wall and she's looking out across the
[1:14:32] audience and she's saying in her mind
[1:14:35] look at all these judgmental
[1:14:37] people and there she is she said her
[1:14:41] clothes weren't appropriate I don't know
[1:14:42] what that means when she told me the
[1:14:45] story and she says you know I was
[1:14:47] covered in makeup and my my clothes and
[1:14:50] and she's like oh you know I was just
[1:14:52] there and and she's looking out about
[1:14:54] all of these people and she says look
[1:14:55] out at all of these judgmental
[1:15:00] people and She
[1:15:04] fainted and she said she said brother
[1:15:06] Daniel she says I've never fainted to
[1:15:09] that point in my life and I never
[1:15:11] fainted after that she said but there I
[1:15:14] was she said doc brother brandom's
[1:15:17] brother takes out his handkerchief wets
[1:15:20] it and and puts it on her face to to try
[1:15:22] to to try to get get her back
[1:15:25] and and and brother brandom says bring
[1:15:27] her up here and set her on the platform
[1:15:30] right here behind me he sets her right
[1:15:32] outside right in front of his personal
[1:15:36] door where it went into his office and
[1:15:38] if you're familiar with the brandom
[1:15:39] Tabernacle there's a door right there it
[1:15:41] is right on the pulpit right where you
[1:15:43] can
[1:15:45] see and they take her up
[1:15:49] there and he looks down at her and he
[1:15:52] says these words he says I want to pray
[1:15:54] for her and he says Lord he says Satan
[1:15:56] is trying to trying to cheat your
[1:16:02] daughter out of a blessing your
[1:16:06] daughter and here she
[1:16:08] was like
[1:16:10] Gandhi didn't look the
[1:16:13] part maybe wasn't acting the part but a
[1:16:16] child of God brother Bram takes her up
[1:16:20] sets her the way she looked right in
[1:16:24] front of the congregation
[1:16:26] and preach that sermon souls are in
[1:16:28] prison
[1:16:29] now she was there and she's sitting
[1:16:34] there and she's thinking about these
[1:16:37] things
[1:16:38] and and she takes Doc's handkerchief was
[1:16:43] wet she wipes her face and she opens it
[1:16:47] up and she sees all of this
[1:16:50] paint on her
[1:16:53] handkerchief and she's said from that
[1:16:55] moment I was
[1:16:57] condemned and she said from that moment
[1:17:00] I
[1:17:01] believed and she turned out to be I tell
[1:17:04] you what if I've ever seen a Holy
[1:17:06] Spirit-filled
[1:17:07] Lady it's that lady very very
[1:17:18] special maybe it's the name
[1:17:20] Shirley it's a special
[1:17:22] name God doesn't show favoritism
[1:17:26] this is contrary it's contrary to the
[1:17:28] very nature of God if we show favoritism
[1:17:32] then we are representing something other
[1:17:35] than God and it's sin as I said there's
[1:17:39] so many ways to sin it may not be
[1:17:41] something outwardly that every that the
[1:17:43] whole world defines as Sin but it could
[1:17:45] be a black Sin of
[1:17:50] favoritism back to James verse 10 for
[1:17:55] whosoever shall keep the whole
[1:17:57] law and yet offend in one point he is
[1:18:01] guilty of
[1:18:03] all NIV version says this but if you
[1:18:06] show favoritism you sin and are
[1:18:09] convicted by the law as law Breakers
[1:18:12] everybody is quick to point out the sins
[1:18:14] of someone
[1:18:16] else but they're quick to also ignore
[1:18:20] their own sins remember I said in in
[1:18:23] last week's sermon that Martin Luther
[1:18:26] said that this book of James is the EP
[1:18:29] Epistle of straw and he didn't even
[1:18:31] believe it should be in the cannon of
[1:18:32] the
[1:18:34] Bible James is saying right here the
[1:18:36] same thing that Paul is saying because
[1:18:38] um Martin Luther was saying that this
[1:18:41] it's this is all about works and not
[1:18:42] Grace but look at what he's saying right
[1:18:44] here whosoever shall keep the whole law
[1:18:46] and yet offend in one point he is guilty
[1:18:48] of all he's
[1:18:50] ignoring that Paul he's not putting
[1:18:53] together that Paul said that all sinned
[1:18:55] and come short of the glory of God that
[1:18:57] we are all sinners and there is the
[1:18:59] grace
[1:19:00] there for he that said do not commit
[1:19:04] adultery said also do not kill now if
[1:19:06] thou commit ad no adultery and if thou
[1:19:09] yet thou kill thou are become a
[1:19:10] transgressor of the law so speak ye and
[1:19:13] do as they that shall be judged by the
[1:19:15] law of Liberty so the law must be obeyed
[1:19:19] and the law is
[1:19:20] liberating it's not a a hammer down on
[1:19:23] you saying you can't do anything
[1:19:24] anything just believing the law it's
[1:19:27] liberating that you can serve Jesus
[1:19:30] Christ and you can change your from your
[1:19:32] sinful ways for he shall have judgment
[1:19:36] for he shall have judgment without Mercy
[1:19:39] that has showed no mercy and mercy
[1:19:42] rejoiceth against judgment new King
[1:19:45] James says for judgment is without Mercy
[1:19:48] to the one who has shown No Mercy Mercy
[1:19:51] triumphs over judgment
[1:19:54] so the mercy that we show to others will
[1:19:58] be extended to us at the day of judgment
[1:20:02] if you are judging other people on the
[1:20:04] basis of their weaknesses then you will
[1:20:07] be judged on the same
[1:20:10] basis if you're looking at other people
[1:20:13] and many of our weaknesses are right out
[1:20:15] there for everybody to see and if you
[1:20:17] are judging someone or if I am judging
[1:20:19] someone on the B basis of their
[1:20:22] weaknesses when I come before the Lord
[1:20:24] do you think that he doesn't see my
[1:20:27] weaknesses do you think he can't see
[1:20:30] them he
[1:20:33] can but if he made the promise judge not
[1:20:37] that you be not
[1:20:40] judged and if we can we can look past
[1:20:43] those weaknesses and look towards that
[1:20:45] Soul that's
[1:20:47] there then I can rest assured Lord I
[1:20:51] looked at the good Lord I tried to get
[1:20:53] them to you and he can come he will say
[1:20:55] come on
[1:20:57] in you're perfect before
[1:20:59] me the blood of Jesus Christ has washed
[1:21:02] away your sins but if we judge
[1:21:06] those we will also be
[1:21:09] judged and I'm about out of time the
[1:21:11] musicians can
[1:21:12] come and we'll finish we'll finish um
[1:21:17] James at another time brothers and
[1:21:21] sisters I believe that the Lord has
[1:21:25] ordained
[1:21:27] Us in his perfect
[1:21:30] time
[1:21:32] to go through this book while we've had
[1:21:36] these articles coming out this past week
[1:21:38] wow every single day front page brother
[1:21:42] Joe sent me a text this morning and said
[1:21:45] yay it's off the front
[1:21:49] page you know what I think it's
[1:21:52] good as I said I think all things work
[1:21:55] together for the good to them who love
[1:21:58] God and are called according to his
[1:22:00] purpose I believe it is it should be a
[1:22:02] time of reflection not just a time of
[1:22:04] reflection for for the the the ones that
[1:22:07] were involved in that maybe the ones
[1:22:10] that came out of that but for all of
[1:22:13] us reflect upon Lord am I
[1:22:17] ashamed of something that I
[1:22:20] believe and do I not want to tell
[1:22:22] somebody that part if not why
[1:22:25] why
[1:22:28] why could it be that you're
[1:22:32] wrong I tell you what I want to say
[1:22:35] everything that I
[1:22:36] believe if somebody calls me out and say
[1:22:39] say well are you are you saying as I
[1:22:42] said at the beginning are you saying
[1:22:44] that you can't go to heaven without
[1:22:45] Jesus Christ
[1:22:47] yes I am saying that sorry it's an
[1:22:49] exclusive
[1:22:51] gospel I am saying that absolutely are
[1:22:53] you saying that that um transgender and
[1:22:57] and all of these these different things
[1:22:59] that we see today are you saying that's
[1:23:01] wrong yes I am saying that it is a
[1:23:06] sin are you saying lying's wrong
[1:23:11] yeah if I neglect any of the
[1:23:15] law then you can be
[1:23:18] condemned by any sin as I said just
[1:23:21] showing
[1:23:23] favoritism James the pastor of the
[1:23:26] church said here just showing
[1:23:29] favoritism you will be guilty of
[1:23:33] sin and it's the truth but I thank the
[1:23:36] Lord as I said I do want to brag on on
[1:23:39] our
[1:23:40] church and I am thankful it's not
[1:23:44] something that we so much struggle with
[1:23:47] we struggle with other things but this
[1:23:49] James the first part of James chapter 2
[1:23:52] I think we're excelling
[1:23:55] I want to continue
[1:23:57] that and um as I said brother Josiah as
[1:24:01] I said that as I said before if you have
[1:24:05] any questions it's my
[1:24:06] job ask and I'll be quick I'll be I'll I
[1:24:11] might not be quick to answer but I'll
[1:24:12] I'll answer the best that I know how and
[1:24:15] and I am I'm very disappointed I'm very
[1:24:18] disappointed on both sides it's like
[1:24:21] you're trying to hide the way you
[1:24:22] believe
[1:24:24] trying to
[1:24:25] hide that there is division you're
[1:24:28] trying to hide that because you believe
[1:24:30] this way that you're cutting out these
[1:24:32] people over
[1:24:33] here you're trying to hide the fact
[1:24:37] that that
[1:24:40] um you excommunicate
[1:24:43] people or you kick them out it's
[1:24:45] wrong there is a place for
[1:24:48] it but not just because you don't you
[1:24:51] don't believe the same
[1:24:54] the same way or or you don't you don't
[1:24:57] believe a certain thing is
[1:24:59] sin no there there's there's no reason
[1:25:01] for
[1:25:02] that so brothers and sisters I want to
[1:25:05] encourage encourage you stand strong
[1:25:08] with the book stand strong with the word
[1:25:11] of God because it won't forsake you
[1:25:14] it'll be there for you and
[1:25:18] don't
[1:25:20] judge according to James chapter 2 don't
[1:25:24] judge by
[1:25:26] appearance because it might be a muham m
[1:25:29] Gandhi that comes into your into your
[1:25:33] congregation or into your your circle of
[1:25:35] friends that may not look right that may
[1:25:37] not talk right that may not act
[1:25:41] right but make sure that you are acting
[1:25:45] right talking right and looking right
[1:25:47] brother Josiah
[1:25:54] the
[1:25:55] way he wants me to live I want to
[1:26:03] give till there's just no more to give I
[1:26:11] want to
[1:26:14] love love till there's just no more love
[1:26:21] for I could never never ever out love
[1:26:27] the
[1:26:29] Lord is that your prayer want to
[1:26:33] live the
[1:26:35] way he wants me to live I want to
[1:26:43] give until there's just no more to give
[1:26:50] I want to love
[1:26:54] love till there's just no more
[1:26:59] love I could
[1:27:02] never never out love the
[1:27:08] Lord I want to
[1:27:12] live the
[1:27:14] way he wants me to live I want to
[1:27:22] give until there's just no more to
[1:27:28] give I want to
[1:27:32] love love till there's just no more love
[1:27:39] for I could
[1:27:41] never never out love the Lord before we
[1:27:47] close I also want to point
[1:27:50] out the mistake that sister Shirley made
[1:27:55] and saying look at all these judgmental
[1:27:58] people like they were all looking at her
[1:28:01] and probably no one noticed
[1:28:03] her she was there and that was the wrong
[1:28:08] attitude to have so many of you brothers
[1:28:11] and sisters that come don't think
[1:28:15] because you look at a certain way that
[1:28:16] people are judging you don't you judge
[1:28:21] someone because you think someone is
[1:28:23] judging you
[1:28:25] judge not that you be not judged also
[1:28:28] counts for the one that's saying don't
[1:28:29] judge
[1:28:31] me you
[1:28:36] understand let's make it about
[1:28:39] Jesus you know brothers and sisters I
[1:28:41] just can't I can't get away of how great
[1:28:44] he is and how much wisdom he has to have
[1:28:47] this Hindu man mahat mandhi read these
[1:28:51] gospels and study on Christan
[1:28:54] Christianity and say wow this man was
[1:28:57] right this man he had the truth he had
[1:29:00] the way to live Jesus lived the life and
[1:29:03] he preached the
[1:29:05] gospel and he taught us how to live and
[1:29:09] he said if you love me keep my
[1:29:11] Commandments do these things that I
[1:29:14] teach
[1:29:15] you and then we'll see the
[1:29:19] benefits from it let's all stand
[1:29:25] Jesus at the center of it
[1:29:32] all Jesus at the center of it all from
