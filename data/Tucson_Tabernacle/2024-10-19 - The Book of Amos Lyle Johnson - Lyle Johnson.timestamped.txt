[30:48] much I'm excited to be here
[30:51] tonight I trust you are too there's so
[30:54] much that we can learn from the books of
[30:57] the Minor
[30:59] Prophets about the Lord about his
[31:03] perspective of his people about life and
[31:08] Society in Bible times about what the
[31:11] Lord expects of us in the 21st century
[31:16] however and you knew there'd be however
[31:20] right so please take your seats for just
[31:22] a
[31:24] moment don't get too comfortable
[31:31] tonight at
[31:33] Sunset the 15th day of the seventh month
[31:36] in the Hebrew calendar the month of tshr
[31:39] there's a full moon tonight in fact it's
[31:41] a super moon tonight which means the
[31:43] moon is closer to the Earth so it
[31:46] appears larger and it's brighter and I
[31:48] think as his people as a church
[31:50] reflecting the light of the lord we
[31:52] should be in a super moon phase of Our
[31:54] Lives tonight as well reflecting Jesus
[31:57] Christ
[31:59] well tonight at Sunset the third of
[32:01] three feasts or holy days that the Lord
[32:04] commanded his people to observe by going
[32:06] to the place where he would put his name
[32:10] Jerusalem do you recall what those three
[32:13] feasts
[32:16] were Deuteronomy 16 we read three times
[32:19] in a year shall thy males appear before
[32:22] the Lord thy God in the place which he
[32:24] shall choose in the Feast of unleavened
[32:27] bread we know that is Passover and as
[32:30] Christians we celebrate
[32:32] Easter in the Feast of Weeks that's
[32:36] Pentecost Lord set everything up so that
[32:39] in Acts two Peter would have the
[32:40] audience when the Holy Spirit
[32:43] fell and in the Feast of
[32:47] Tabernacles Tabernacles it means tents
[32:50] booths Huts temporary
[32:54] structures and they shall not appear
[32:56] before the Lord empty every man shall
[32:58] give as he is able according to the
[33:00] blessing of the Lord thy God which he
[33:01] hath given
[33:03] thee Tabernacles is at the end of the
[33:05] harvest season it's a time of
[33:08] celebration of the bounty of the land in
[33:10] worship to the Lord and expressing
[33:12] thanks for the Lord who gave such a
[33:15] bounty and recalling the years of
[33:19] wandering As Told in Exodus and not just
[33:23] that but every seventh year Deuteronomy
[33:26] 31 Moses wrote this law and delivered it
[33:29] unto the priests the sons of Levi which
[33:31] bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[33:33] and unto all the Elders of
[33:36] Israel and Moses commanded them saying
[33:40] at the end of every seven years in the
[33:43] solity of the year of release in the
[33:46] Feast of Tabernacles when all Israel is
[33:49] come to appear before the Lord thy God
[33:52] in the place which he shall choose thou
[33:55] the priests and the elders shalt read
[33:58] this law before all Israel in their
[34:01] hearing gather the people together men
[34:05] and women and
[34:07] children and the stranger that's within
[34:10] your Gates that they may hear that they
[34:13] may learn and fear the lord your God and
[34:17] to observe to do all the words of this
[34:21] law and that their children which have
[34:24] not known anything may hear and learn to
[34:27] fear the lord your God as long as you
[34:30] live in the land whether you go over
[34:32] Jordan to possess
[34:36] it it was during this week-long
[34:39] Gathering every seventh year the entire
[34:41] book of the law was to be read aloud to
[34:43] everyone not just in Jerusalem not just
[34:46] to the male pilgrims we saw this reading
[34:49] occur in Nehemiah chapter
[34:52] 8 spoiler
[34:55] alert looking ahead in our series of all
[34:57] the feasts and observances Tabernacles
[35:00] is the one the Lord emphasized in
[35:03] zachariah's Visions describing a future
[35:05] Kingdom on the earth Zechariah 14 we
[35:07] read the Lord shall be king over all the
[35:09] Earth and that day shall there be one
[35:12] Lord and his name one we look forward to
[35:15] that day it shall come to pass that
[35:19] everyone that is left of all the nations
[35:21] which came against Jerusalem shall even
[35:23] go up from year to year to worship the
[35:26] king the Lord of hosts
[35:28] and to keep the Feast of
[35:31] Tabernacles not Passover not
[35:35] Pentecost
[35:38] Tabernacles this celebration is done in
[35:40] temporary structures with a loose roof
[35:42] so one can see the stars of Heaven
[35:44] through it and the full moon it's a time
[35:46] of sharing of meals with friends and
[35:50] neighbors I remember these occasions
[35:52] when I worked at l in Israel and during
[35:55] sucot at lunch go to the cafeteria get
[35:57] your meal go out into a big Suka they
[35:59] had set up there and just mingle with
[36:01] people and
[36:03] share the booster Tabernacles recall the
[36:05] wandering after leaving Egypt and prior
[36:08] to entering the land of promise
[36:11] reflecting on total dependence on the
[36:13] Lord for life and sustenance in a harsh
[36:16] place that could not support the
[36:19] population a continuous 40 years long
[36:24] miracle for a people being punished for
[36:28] refusing to take the land when 10 of the
[36:30] spies brought a bad
[36:33] report there are of course many
[36:35] Traditions associated with the
[36:37] celebrations Leviticus 23:40 he shall
[36:39] take on you the first day the bows of
[36:41] goodly trees branches of palm trees the
[36:44] boughs of thick trees and Willows of the
[36:45] brook and you shall rejoice before the
[36:48] Lord your God seven
[36:51] days suot to me this signifies that we
[36:56] should Gather in in spite of differences
[36:59] break down walls that separate to
[37:02] celebrate the Bounty of the Lord to have
[37:05] genuine Fellowship together and worship
[37:08] and praise the Lord together not just
[37:12] during this Feast but all the time I I
[37:15] personally find it curious that of the
[37:17] three feasts that the Lord especially
[37:19] emphasizes and Christianity we observe
[37:22] the first two in some fashion but the
[37:24] third Tabernacles we generally
[37:28] ignore
[37:30] finally sukot is a perfect leadin for
[37:34] this evening's
[37:35] study and now to our book this evening
[37:40] Amos that's the Hebrew pronunciation
[37:43] Hebrew almost always accents the final
[37:45] cylinder Heather tells me in Spanish it
[37:47] is Amos I used to say Amos I'm likely to
[37:52] say it all three ways this evening so if
[37:54] I say Amos or Amos or Amos I'm talking
[37:57] about the same guy and the same
[38:00] book okay and and almost by the way
[38:03] means burdened or or
[38:05] burdensome difficult to carry out or or
[38:08] fulfill and he carried such a burden of
[38:11] Prophecy which he
[38:13] delivered before we dig into this book
[38:16] please let's stand together one more
[38:17] time and approach the Lord in
[38:23] prayer father we are in awe of you we're
[38:28] so grateful that you've given us the
[38:29] privilege to live in the 21st century to
[38:33] be here present at this time to be
[38:35] gathered together of our own free will
[38:37] Lord to hear from you Lord nobody's here
[38:40] to hear from Lyle Johnson nobody cares
[38:42] and he has nothing worth hearing to say
[38:45] but Lord we're here to hear from you all
[38:47] of us each of us so Lord speak to our
[38:49] hearts help us to lay aside the burdens
[38:52] of the day our thoughts everything Lord
[38:54] and just focus concentrate on you be
[38:58] sensitive to what you might say Lord
[39:00] Seagle my lips against saying anything
[39:02] that would cause anyone to stumble Lord
[39:05] and and anoint the ears of everyone
[39:07] that's hearing that they hear what you
[39:09] have this evening for them we thank you
[39:12] and we praise you and we're here in
[39:15] expectation Lord Jesus
[39:19] amen for our opening verses and before
[39:22] we're seated I'd like to I've got two
[39:25] I'd like to first read a short account
[39:28] from the gospels Jesus being challenged
[39:31] during his final week in Jerusalem was
[39:33] asked about the greatest commandment
[39:34] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[39:37] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[39:40] thy
[39:41] soul with all thy mind this is the first
[39:44] and great commandment and the second is
[39:47] like unto it Thou shalt love thy
[39:50] neighbor as
[39:52] thyself on these two Commandments hang
[39:56] all the law
[39:58] and the
[39:59] prophets this is a wonderful preview of
[40:02] The Book of Amos this book emphasizes
[40:06] both of these
[40:08] principles and next an account from 2
[40:13] Chronicles of an event that occurred
[40:15] about a century before the ministry of
[40:18] amosa the scene is that a massive Army
[40:21] has gathered comprised of several of the
[40:23] enemies of Judah they're on the shores
[40:26] of the Dead Sea near engedi King
[40:29] Jehoshaphat in the Judean Hills has
[40:32] turned to the Lord for help 2 Chronicles
[40:34] 2012 is the end of his prayer let's read
[40:38] Oh Our God wil thou not judge them we
[40:42] have no might against this great company
[40:44] that cometh against us neither know we
[40:47] what to do but our eyes are upon thee
[40:52] it's always good advice just like
[40:54] Hezekiah and the days of Isaiah's
[40:56] prophecy
[40:58] and all Judah stood before the Lord with
[41:01] their little ones their wives and their
[41:05] children
[41:06] Unity everyone standing together from
[41:09] the youngest to the oldest boys and
[41:11] girls men and women and in this unity in
[41:15] this hush turning to the
[41:20] Lord then upon yahel the son of
[41:23] Zachariah the son of bananah the son of
[41:25] yel the son of matani
[41:28] we given this identity because he's an
[41:31] unknown to us he's just a member of the
[41:34] priesthood a levite of the sons of Asaf
[41:38] Asaf you recall wrote some of the Psalms
[41:41] on this guy suddenly like out of nowhere
[41:44] came the spirit of the Lord in the midst
[41:46] of the congregation and jahaziel said
[41:49] hearken
[41:50] ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of
[41:53] Jerusalem and Thou King jehos ofet that
[41:57] that's pretty bold telling the king to
[42:00] pay attention to the simple priest thus
[42:04] saith the Lord unto you individually and
[42:07] collectively Be not Afraid nor dismayed
[42:10] by reason of this great multitude for
[42:12] the battle is not yours but God's
[42:15] tomorrow go ye down against them that
[42:17] means opposite them behold they come up
[42:19] by the Cliff of ziz they can't hide from
[42:22] me and ye shall find them at the end of
[42:24] the brook before the Wilderness of
[42:27] Jerel you shall not need to fight in
[42:30] this battle set yourselves stand ye
[42:34] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[42:37] with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not
[42:40] nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against
[42:42] them for the Lord will be with
[42:45] you go face this overwhelming Force
[42:48] against which you have no chance Don't
[42:50] Run Away don't flee don't hide face the
[42:54] enemy and see what the Lord Lord will do
[42:57] for you and Jehoshaphat showing good
[43:01] Godly leadership before all the people
[43:03] the king to which everyone else bows
[43:05] bowed his head with his face to the
[43:08] ground and all Judah and the inhabitants
[43:10] of Jerusalem fell before the Lord
[43:12] worshiping the Lord following
[43:14] jehoshaphat's example and the Levites of
[43:17] the children of the coites and of the
[43:19] children of the kites stood up to praise
[43:23] the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice
[43:25] on high no notice they're praising the
[43:29] Lord for his Deliverance before the
[43:32] battle is
[43:33] fought is is fought the enemy is still
[43:36] Gathering out there marshalling together
[43:38] the enemy hasn't been engaged they have
[43:40] confidence they have trust they're
[43:43] putting their faith in the words of an
[43:46] unknown
[43:49] prophet and they arose early in the
[43:52] morning and went forth Into the
[43:53] Wilderness of tcoa remember this
[43:56] location to COA and as they went forth
[44:00] Jehoshaphat stood and said perhaps his
[44:03] most Sage advice and Direction and
[44:05] admonition of his
[44:07] life hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants
[44:11] of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your
[44:14] God so shall you be
[44:16] established safe upheld endure believe
[44:20] His prophets so shall you
[44:24] prosper can we read that advice together
[44:28] out loud believe in the Lord your God so
[44:32] shall you be established believe His
[44:35] prophets so shall you
[44:38] prosper maybe one more time believe in
[44:41] the Lord your God so shall you be
[44:44] established believe His prophets so
[44:48] shall you
[44:49] prosper and when jeos had consulted with
[44:52] the people he appointed singers unto the
[44:55] Lord that they should praise the beauty
[44:57] of Holiness as they went out before in
[45:00] front of leading the way before the Army
[45:06] and to say praise the Lord for his mercy
[45:09] endureth forever maybe we can all repeat
[45:11] that too praise the Lord for his mercy
[45:15] endureth
[45:18] forever and when they began to sing and
[45:21] to praise not before not they saw
[45:24] something and began to sing they began
[45:26] to sing and pra prise and when that
[45:28] happened just like we were doing as I
[45:31] came up to the pulpit this evening at
[45:34] that time then the Lord set ambushments
[45:38] against the children of Amon Moab and
[45:41] mount seir which were come up against
[45:44] Judah and they were
[45:47] smitten how did the Lord do that just
[45:49] just one more verse for the children of
[45:52] Aman and Moab two of the groups that
[45:54] were United against Judah stood up
[45:57] against the inhabitants of Mount seir
[45:59] the third component of their Alliance
[46:02] Adam the descendants of Esau utterly to
[46:06] to slay and Destroy them and when they
[46:09] had made an end to the inhabitants of
[46:11] seir everyone helped to destroy
[46:13] another they turned on each
[46:17] other the Lord took away their
[46:22] Unity please be seated
[46:28] if I were a
[46:29] preacher I'd spend the next few hours
[46:32] expounding on the lessons of this
[46:33] portion of 2 Chronicles but I'm not so I
[46:37] won't besides tonight's about
[46:41] Amos I read this portion of scripture
[46:44] because it deals with the importance of
[46:46] hearing and believing what the Lord says
[46:49] through His prophets and Amos was such a
[46:54] prophet and because it takes place in
[46:56] the wilderness of tcoa where the spirit
[46:59] of the Lord fell on OS in the form of
[47:02] Prophecy and like jhazel Amos was an
[47:06] unlikely candidate to be a
[47:12] prophet OS is II among the group we call
[47:16] Minor Prophets minor simply means the
[47:18] amount of written prophets that they
[47:20] left as less than the amount of the
[47:21] Major Prophets like Isaiah or
[47:25] Ezekiel let's start start the study and
[47:27] by the way young people there's a quiz
[47:31] hopefully you have your
[47:33] quiz okay we'll start with verse one of
[47:36] chapter one of
[47:38] Amos we're trying to get context
[47:41] here the words of Amos who was among the
[47:45] herdmen and that means sheep herders and
[47:47] sheep breeders of
[47:49] tcoa which he saw concerning Israel and
[47:54] the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the
[47:57] days of jeroboam the son of joash king
[48:00] of Israel two years before the
[48:04] earthquake well this verse identifies
[48:06] almost by name tells us his occupation
[48:10] where he worked and lived and the
[48:12] approximate time of his ministry based
[48:15] on the overlapping period of The reigns
[48:17] of the two kings and then he says oh and
[48:20] by the way this was two years before the
[48:23] earthquake not an earthquake but
[48:27] the
[48:29] earthquake H well first let's get
[48:32] Geographic context we'll use references
[48:34] from the reading of 2
[48:36] Chronicles on the right side is an
[48:39] overall map showing the kingdom of Judah
[48:41] and violet and Israel in green the area
[48:45] inside the red box is expanded on the
[48:47] left side of the
[48:49] screen there I've marked the three
[48:51] nations gathered against Jehosaphat in
[48:53] rectangular boxes Amon Moab and Edom you
[48:56] can see that their
[48:58] neighbors the enemy armies are gathered
[49:00] at inti marked with a blue oval on the
[49:03] shores of the Dead Sea I'm sure you can
[49:05] see that right
[49:07] there and the path they will March is in
[49:10] red I've also indicated the locations of
[49:13] Jerusalem and tcoa with green ovals you
[49:17] can see tcoa is slightly South and a bit
[49:19] West of Jerusalem a distance of only 11
[49:21] or 12
[49:22] miles I've also marked bethl with yellow
[49:25] oval where where Amos will be delivering
[49:28] his message to Israel as you can see
[49:29] it's in Israel and you recall from our
[49:32] earlier uh lessons on in Kings and
[49:34] Samuel and so forth that that's where
[49:36] the first guy named jeroboam set up uh
[49:40] Idols to be worshiped there so people
[49:41] wouldn't go to
[49:43] Jerusalem well here's a satellite view
[49:46] of of the same areas you can see tcoa is
[49:49] on the edge of the Judean Hills where
[49:51] the land rapidly drops into the parched
[49:53] Bleak desert Wilderness leading to the
[49:55] Dead Sea the Hills are about 2,000 ft
[49:58] above sea level of tcoa the Dead Sea
[50:00] 1300 ft below sea level the lowest point
[50:03] on the surface of the Earth
[50:06] takoa is where the spirit of the Lord
[50:10] falls on a sheep breeder of Judah to
[50:13] deliver a prophetic message to the
[50:16] Kingdom of
[50:18] Israel well with a geographic context
[50:21] established let's see if we can be more
[50:22] precise about the the date of the
[50:24] beginning of amamos Prophecy
[50:27] what is this about the
[50:30] earthquake it was a well-known event
[50:32] back in the day some 250 years after Amo
[50:35] Zachariah would
[50:37] write yay ye shall flee like as you fled
[50:40] from before the earthquake and the days
[50:43] of Uzziah king of
[50:47] Judah turns out there's widespread
[50:50] evidence of a massive earthquake that
[50:52] occurred in the mid 8th Century BC
[50:55] throughout the Levant the POR of the
[50:56] Middle East that includes Israel a
[50:59] combination of that evidence biblical
[51:01] texts and even a comment from Josephus
[51:04] helps us nail this down most Scholars
[51:07] that study this sort of thing agree it
[51:09] was in 760 BC a few say 750 either way
[51:14] we know his ministry was then in the
[51:16] days of Hosea Isaiah and probably Micah
[51:19] and even
[51:20] Jonah the the photo has an arrow
[51:23] pointing to a tilting wall of an ancient
[51:25] Fortress and that tilt to that wall is
[51:28] from earthquake damage based on all the
[51:31] archaeological finds there's lots of
[51:32] things you can't read over here those
[51:34] are all places where they found evidence
[51:37] of of an earthquake the epicenter has
[51:39] been pretty well located in what is now
[51:41] Lebanon the magnitude is thought to have
[51:43] been about
[51:45] 8.2 this is a massive
[51:47] earthquake for example in May of 2008 a
[51:51] slightly smaller magnitude 7.9 Quake
[51:54] struck Eastern chesan China who
[51:56] resulting in over 87,500
[52:01] deaths let's take one more brief detour
[52:06] to help establish context this time to 2
[52:08] Kings 14 verses 23 to 29 are the only
[52:12] record we really have of the reign of
[52:14] King jeroboam II in Israel though he is
[52:18] referred to many times as we just read
[52:19] in verse one of almost this helps us
[52:22] understand the social and economic
[52:25] context of Israel at the time of Amos
[52:28] Ministry we need this context to
[52:32] understand why the prophecy is the way
[52:35] the prophecy is why the Lord is focused
[52:37] on the things he's focused on 2 Kings 14
[52:41] in the 15th year of amziah the son of
[52:43] joash King of Judah jeroboam the son of
[52:46] joash of Israel began to reign in
[52:49] Samaria and he reigned 41 years it's a
[52:53] long time especially with the kings in
[52:54] those days
[52:56] what sort of King was this guy he did
[52:59] that which was evil in the sight of the
[53:02] Lord he departed not from a few or some
[53:08] no he departed not from all the sins of
[53:10] jeroboam the son of nabat who made
[53:12] Israel to sin setting up Idols in bethl
[53:16] and Dan encouraging unfaithfulness to
[53:18] the Lord this is now the second king
[53:21] named jeroboam so we call him jeroboam
[53:24] II jeroboam the second second restored
[53:27] the borders of Israel from the entering
[53:29] of hamat Unto the Sea of the plain
[53:32] according to the word of the Lord God of
[53:35] Israel which he spake by the hand of his
[53:37] servant Jonah son of amiti the Prophet
[53:41] which was of gaer this is the same Jonah
[53:45] whose book we'll study in a couple of
[53:50] weeks he's this evil
[53:53] guy but he's restoring the borders
[53:56] according according to a prophecy from
[53:58] Jonah for the Lord saw the Affliction of
[54:01] Israel that it was very bitter for there
[54:05] was not any shut up nor any left no one
[54:08] slave or free was spared nor any helper
[54:12] for Israel nobody to help them and the
[54:15] Lord said that had not said that he
[54:18] would blot
[54:19] out what
[54:21] happened there we go sorry but
[54:26] maybe it's my personality getting too
[54:28] close to that thing I don't know I hope
[54:29] not there was not any helper for Israel
[54:31] the Lord had said not that he would blot
[54:34] out the name of Israel from under heaven
[54:36] but he saved them by the hand of this
[54:39] very jeroboam the son of joash the one
[54:42] who did evil in the sight of the
[54:46] Lord now the rest of the acts of
[54:48] jeroboam all that he did his might how
[54:51] he wared how he recovered Damascus and
[54:54] hamat which belonged to Judah for Israel
[54:57] are they not written in the book of The
[54:59] Chronicles of the Kings of Israel and
[55:01] jeroboam slept with his fathers even
[55:03] with the Kings of Israel and Zachariah
[55:05] his son reigned in his
[55:09] stead so we see he was an evil King yet
[55:13] the Lord used him to protect and
[55:15] preserve Israel this was prophesied by
[55:18] the very Jonah that would go to Nineveh
[55:20] and preserve them and they would then
[55:23] conquer and destroy the nation of Israel
[55:25] some 40 years after Jonah's Ministry
[55:27] there under jeroboam II Israel was
[55:31] Victorious they gained strength they
[55:34] gained wealth a new era of prosperity
[55:38] had arrived in
[55:39] Israel yet the nation continued to turn
[55:43] its back on the Lord and not only in
[55:46] worship but on the very Foundation of
[55:50] their
[55:52] society there are many ways to divide
[55:55] the book into sections or topics or
[55:57] themes this is just one you'll no doubt
[56:00] notice the term judgment appears along
[56:02] with guilt punishment
[56:07] destruction what do you think of when
[56:09] you hear the term the Judgment of God or
[56:14] God proclaiming judgment is it positive
[56:19] or negative to be embraced or to be
[56:23] feared to be welcomed or shun
[56:28] remember the story of Ahab Jezebel and
[56:30] the vineyard of nobot nobot was killed
[56:33] so Ahab could have a Vineyard he wanted
[56:35] but didn't need we'll see in the most
[56:38] that the Lord has harsh words for
[56:40] certain elements of Israel's
[56:43] Society under the law there was a
[56:46] jubilee every 50 years when land
[56:49] ownership was
[56:50] restored one never sold the land it was
[56:54] effectively leased for no more than 40 9
[56:56] years perhaps to raise money to pay a
[56:58] debt this is described in Leviticus 25
[57:01] 8-
[57:02] 55 but over time this had changed we'll
[57:07] see that in Amos that the Lord was very
[57:11] unhappy about the
[57:13] changes we'll see how this ties into the
[57:16] concept of judgment and its intended
[57:20] result
[57:22] Justice this is a good time I think to
[57:25] introduce the
[57:27] theme of Osa
[57:29] prophecies and that
[57:32] theme is God's passionate concern for
[57:41] justice Hebrew word happens to be
[57:45] mishpat what is Justice or what the King
[57:49] James version calls
[57:52] judgment what do you think of when you
[57:53] hear those words
[57:56] under Mosaic law The landholding
[57:58] Peasants or subsistence farmers were the
[58:01] foundation of Israel's
[58:04] society when Joshua led the conquest the
[58:07] division was of land not wealth not gold
[58:11] or silver or plunder if you will it was
[58:14] all about land and land is all about
[58:18] agriculture you'll notice when you read
[58:21] in the Old Testament ties were of crops
[58:23] and livestock offerings were generally
[58:26] not of money but of sacrificial
[58:28] animals Israel's renewed Prosperity
[58:31] under jeroboam II brought New Wealth to
[58:35] the upper classes the rich became richer
[58:38] the poor became poorer government
[58:42] including the courts was
[58:44] corrupt notice I mentioned at the
[58:47] beginning of this evening's lesson that
[58:48] sukot ties in perfectly with Amos we we
[58:51] read Deuteronomy 16: 16 and 17 about the
[58:55] men going to Jerusalem to observe this
[58:57] Feast let's read just the next three
[59:00] verses verse 18 judges and officers
[59:03] shalt thou make thee in all thy Gates
[59:07] which the Lord thy God giveth thee
[59:09] throughout thy tribes throughout the
[59:11] land not just in particular cities and
[59:14] they shall judge the people with just
[59:18] judgment settle disputes with complete
[59:22] fairness and a warning Thou shalt not
[59:25] rest that means to twist or distort or
[59:29] pervert or misapply or misinterpret
[59:32] judgment Thou shalt not respect persons
[59:36] show no favoritism or partiality whether
[59:39] it's the king or a
[59:41] slave neither take a gift never accept a
[59:46] bribe however it may be disguised for a
[59:50] gift doth blind the eyes of the wise and
[59:54] pervert the words of the rightous
[59:59] it reminds me of a time I was doing work
[1:00:02] in the aircraft industry and I went to
[1:00:04] Los Angeles to the FAA and we were
[1:00:06] trying to get something resolved about
[1:00:09] some modifications we were making to an
[1:00:11] aircraft and the fellow that I was
[1:00:13] meeting with we hit pretty well and we
[1:00:15] went down to get lunch in the cafeteria
[1:00:17] and I offered to buy his lunch I wasn't
[1:00:18] thinking about anything I was 27 years
[1:00:21] old or something and he no can't can't
[1:00:25] do that that's influence oh okay I I
[1:00:28] learned that lesson then but he was an
[1:00:30] ethical person and he was making sure
[1:00:33] that I was an ethical person I guess so
[1:00:35] pay close attention to the next
[1:00:38] verse that which is altogether just
[1:00:42] uncompromisingly righteous True Justice
[1:00:45] and Justice alone shalt thou
[1:00:48] follow and the benefits of this include
[1:00:51] that thou mayest live and inherit the
[1:00:54] land which the Lord thy God God giveth
[1:00:57] thee back to the land almost Ministry
[1:01:01] was a call to the leadership of Israel
[1:01:04] to repent and
[1:01:07] reform if they did not the Injustice to
[1:01:10] the poor and the weak would destroy the
[1:01:12] nation the Lord would not allow them to
[1:01:15] continue in such a way two choices were
[1:01:17] available repentance and
[1:01:20] reform or
[1:01:22] retribution
[1:01:24] Mercy or
[1:01:27] punishment
[1:01:28] choices recall our reading from Matthew
[1:01:32] love the Lord and love your neighbor if
[1:01:37] there's
[1:01:38] Injustice you're not loving your
[1:01:40] neighbor or the
[1:01:43] Lord if I had to reduce the entire Book
[1:01:46] of Amos to just one verse it would be
[1:01:51] this let judgment run down as Waters and
[1:01:56] righteousness as a mighty
[1:01:59] stream I I took a crack at trying to
[1:02:02] decode the Hebrew there and that's the
[1:02:05] King James version the Lyall Johnson
[1:02:07] version is let Justice roll down as
[1:02:09] water and righteousness as a Perpetual
[1:02:14] torrent sounds good to be
[1:02:18] desired but what is
[1:02:22] righteousness what what what is this
[1:02:25] thing that the Lord
[1:02:27] wants what is righteousness Sak what is
[1:02:31] it what do you think of how does it
[1:02:34] apply in your life or in
[1:02:37] mine dictionary says righteousness is
[1:02:40] the quality or state of being righteous
[1:02:43] it is the actor conduct of one who is
[1:02:47] righteous it sounds pretty circular to
[1:02:49] me what does righteous mean according to
[1:02:52] Webster it's it's an adjective acting in
[1:02:55] accord
[1:02:56] with Divine or moral law free from guilt
[1:03:01] or sin that same Hebrew word is
[1:03:03] translated innocent in other places
[1:03:06] morally right or justifiable like a
[1:03:09] righteous decision arising from an
[1:03:11] outraged sense of justice or morality
[1:03:13] like righteous
[1:03:15] indignation in God's eyes the Divine or
[1:03:19] moral law is from him it's according to
[1:03:21] the Bible every seventh year review all
[1:03:24] of this a person who is a radical Muslim
[1:03:27] might believe he's living in
[1:03:28] righteousness by killing one he
[1:03:30] considers an Infidel according to Sharia
[1:03:32] law so the laws to which you're striving
[1:03:35] to conform
[1:03:39] matter Isaiah tells us for the Lord is
[1:03:43] our judge the Lord is our
[1:03:47] lawgiver the Lord is our King he will
[1:03:50] save
[1:03:52] us and almost a righteous person was one
[1:03:55] who obey made the written law which came
[1:03:57] through
[1:03:58] Moses in our day Paul wrote in Romans 10
[1:04:02] Moses describes the righteousness which
[1:04:04] is of the law that the man that does
[1:04:06] these things shall live by them but the
[1:04:09] righteousness which is of faith speaketh
[1:04:13] on this wise it says the word is nigh
[1:04:16] thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:04:20] that is the word of faith which we
[1:04:23] preach that if Thou shalt confess With
[1:04:25] Thine mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt
[1:04:28] believe in thine heart that God hath
[1:04:29] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[1:04:31] saved for with the heart man believeth
[1:04:35] unto righteousness it's declared
[1:04:37] righteous acceptable to God and with a
[1:04:40] mouth confession is made to
[1:04:45] Salvation what the Lord desired at Amos
[1:04:48] day he still desires in our day today
[1:04:52] righteousness comes by faith
[1:04:55] righteousness is is a quality that
[1:04:57] results in being right in the eyes of
[1:05:00] God including our character or nature
[1:05:03] our conscience or attitude our conduct
[1:05:08] or actions our
[1:05:17] words one more thing to establish and
[1:05:19] then we'll dig into the book Let's
[1:05:21] establish what we know about OS the man
[1:05:24] we saw in the opening vers he was a
[1:05:26] sheep herder wasn't a priest he wasn't a
[1:05:28] levite he wasn't a trained Prophet or
[1:05:30] anything he owned his sheep he was not a
[1:05:34] hired Shepherd by the same token he
[1:05:36] tended his own sheep he was not wealthy
[1:05:39] enough to hire a
[1:05:41] Shepherd in chapter 7 OS had delivered
[1:05:44] most of his prophecies he was in Israel
[1:05:47] at at bethl and was ordered to leave and
[1:05:49] returned to Judah by a priest named
[1:05:53] amziah then answered Amos said to
[1:05:56] amziah I was no
[1:05:59] Prophet neither was I a prophet son I
[1:06:02] was a Herdman and a gatherer of sycamore
[1:06:06] fruit and the Lord took me as I followed
[1:06:09] the flock and the Lord said unto me
[1:06:12] go go to Israel prophesy unto My People
[1:06:19] Israel almost apparently own no pasture
[1:06:22] Lander if he did it wasn't year round
[1:06:24] pasture Shepherds would move the Sheep
[1:06:27] to suitable pasture and in Amo case and
[1:06:30] probably many others this was regularly
[1:06:32] on land used to raise Sycamore fig trees
[1:06:36] while the Sheep grazed almost worked for
[1:06:38] the owner of the orchard for the right
[1:06:40] to graze the Sheep
[1:06:41] there how do we know what was not his
[1:06:43] own Sycamore
[1:06:48] Grove the King James uses a curious term
[1:06:53] gatherer of the fruit my first reaction
[1:06:56] when I read this was oh he harvested the
[1:06:58] fruit he gathered it up right but I
[1:07:01] don't know if that's what you think when
[1:07:03] you see that that's what I thought it's
[1:07:05] not the case other translations say he
[1:07:09] tended or dressed or took care of
[1:07:11] it well what's going
[1:07:14] on it's time to
[1:07:17] dig in fact the Hebrew word Bas
[1:07:20] translated gatherer occurs only once in
[1:07:23] the entire Bible
[1:07:26] and its root means pinched that doesn't
[1:07:29] mean like today if somebody pinches
[1:07:30] something we mean that they took it when
[1:07:32] they shouldn't have but
[1:07:34] pinched these fruits or figs at a
[1:07:37] certain stage needed to be punctured or
[1:07:39] cut slightly to hasten their ripening a
[1:07:42] very tedious and labor intensive task I
[1:07:45] I I found this from a domestication of
[1:07:47] plants in the old world from the Oxford
[1:07:49] University press in 2001 you can see a
[1:07:52] picture of of of these of these figs
[1:07:55] Sumer more ripe than others and I'll
[1:07:58] just help summarize this because I'm
[1:07:59] sure it's a little hard for you to read
[1:08:01] there the cultivation of the Sycamore
[1:08:03] fig has been almost exclusively an
[1:08:05] Egyptian specialty compared with a
[1:08:08] common fig it is a much taller and
[1:08:11] larger tree where did we run across that
[1:08:15] zakus come down from there I'm going to
[1:08:17] spend the afternoon with
[1:08:19] you was a sycamore fig tree that zakus
[1:08:22] was in that is the part of Israel one of
[1:08:26] the parts of Israel where these trees
[1:08:28] were but it produces smaller fruit since
[1:08:32] early dynastic times in Egypt going on
[1:08:34] back to the time of Abraham and before
[1:08:36] the Sycamore fig was and still is
[1:08:38] commonly used fruit crop and valued
[1:08:40] Timber Source in the lower Nile Valley
[1:08:43] the Sycamore fig was introduced into
[1:08:45] warmer parts of
[1:08:46] Israel cultivation depends on rooting of
[1:08:49] Twigs rather than
[1:08:51] seeds some varieties bear fruit without
[1:08:54] pollenization while in others fruit
[1:08:57] maturation is artificially induced by
[1:09:00] gashing the surface of the young seonia
[1:09:03] the fruit this is an old tradition in
[1:09:06] Egypt and in
[1:09:10] Israel gashing puncturing the service
[1:09:13] isn't it amazing what you can learn just
[1:09:15] by trying to understand the meaning of a
[1:09:17] single word in the
[1:09:19] Bible Well from all of this we see that
[1:09:22] OS was a man of the people he was not of
[1:09:26] any privileged class the Lord sent him
[1:09:28] from Judah to prophesy to Israel he was
[1:09:32] likely in Israel only a few weeks before
[1:09:34] he had to return to the Sheep the fact
[1:09:37] that he indicates his ministry occurred
[1:09:40] two years before the earthquake rather
[1:09:42] than here's a list of Kings where my
[1:09:44] Ministry was or my Ministry started two
[1:09:46] years before the earthquake he says this
[1:09:48] happened two years before the earthquake
[1:09:50] it suggests it was a very brief public
[1:09:53] Ministry well
[1:09:56] let's look at some of his prophecies
[1:09:58] chapter by chapter starting with the
[1:10:00] first one after introducing himself
[1:10:03] almost lists five judgments of God on
[1:10:07] Israel's neighbors each follows a
[1:10:09] similar pattern we'll look at the second
[1:10:11] one against Gaza it's the same physical
[1:10:14] General geographic area of the Gaza
[1:10:16] that's in the news today and has been
[1:10:17] for the last year almost 1 16 thus
[1:10:21] sayith the Lord for three transgressions
[1:10:24] of Gaza and for for I will not turn away
[1:10:27] the punishment thereof because They
[1:10:29] Carried Away captive the whole captivity
[1:10:31] to deliver them up to Edom in other
[1:10:32] words the city the people they took they
[1:10:34] took them all to Edom Edom you recall
[1:10:38] was the territory of Esau Jacob's twin
[1:10:41] but I will send fire on the wall of Gaza
[1:10:43] which shall Devour the Palaces
[1:10:48] thereof for three
[1:10:50] transgressions no make it four God
[1:10:53] doesn't have a bad memory
[1:10:56] he's been around a long time a lot
[1:10:58] longer than I have I have problems with
[1:11:00] my memory God does not have problems
[1:11:02] with his and he can count accurately so
[1:11:06] this is an idiom it's an expression
[1:11:08] which tells us the Lord is weary of the
[1:11:10] continuing transgressions of
[1:11:13] Gaza next the nature of the problem is
[1:11:16] told in all five of these the Lord is
[1:11:18] holding the count the country the region
[1:11:20] or the people to a much lower standard
[1:11:22] than he holds Israel because they're not
[1:11:25] part of the Covenant it's just stuff
[1:11:26] that they should know better in the case
[1:11:28] of Edom it's the ongoing grudge against
[1:11:31] Jacob held over many generations as Edom
[1:11:35] assisted Israel's enemies Esau their
[1:11:39] ancestor knew better each prophecy ends
[1:11:43] with fire that destroys the Palaces or
[1:11:45] strongholds of the king or
[1:11:47] ruler in chapter two the Lord moves on
[1:11:50] to Judah and Israel and this is all that
[1:11:52] he says about Judah the rest of it
[1:11:55] pretty much is about Israel so I'm
[1:12:01] displaying the King James but I'm going
[1:12:04] to read you the text from the NLT so you
[1:12:06] can follow it there but what I'm saying
[1:12:09] is might be a little
[1:12:10] clearer this is what the Lord
[1:12:13] says the people of Judah have sinned
[1:12:16] again and again and I will not let them
[1:12:19] go
[1:12:19] unpunished they have rejected the
[1:12:22] instruction of the Lord refusing to obey
[1:12:25] his decrees they have been LED astray by
[1:12:28] the same lies that deceived their
[1:12:31] ancestors verse five so I will send down
[1:12:34] fire on Judah and all the fortresses of
[1:12:37] Jerusalem will be
[1:12:40] destroyed the remainder of chapter two
[1:12:42] is a much lengthier judgment pronounced
[1:12:45] on the Kingdom of
[1:12:47] Israel well let's go to chapter 3 verses
[1:12:50] from this chapter are often quoted so
[1:12:52] let's read all 15 verses
[1:12:56] it'll take less than two hours so bear
[1:12:59] with me OS
[1:13:01] 3:1 hear this word that the Lord has
[1:13:04] spoken against you oh children of Israel
[1:13:07] against the whole family which I brought
[1:13:09] up from the land of Egypt saying you
[1:13:12] only have I known of all the families of
[1:13:15] the earth therefore I will punish you
[1:13:19] for your
[1:13:20] iniquities then he starts giving a list
[1:13:22] of
[1:13:24] contrasts can two walk together except
[1:13:28] they be agreed we hear a lot of this
[1:13:31] what does that mean does that mean to be
[1:13:33] in lock step you agree with every
[1:13:35] thought I have and if you don't well you
[1:13:36] must be wrong and I must be right I
[1:13:38] can't have fellowship with
[1:13:40] you what did Brother Brandon say about
[1:13:42] this sort of thing he said check your
[1:13:45] motive check your objective why are you
[1:13:48] doing this going or not going what are
[1:13:50] you trying to achieve or avoid it's
[1:13:54] often used as an excuse to draw a
[1:13:56] smaller Circle to avoid Fellowship to
[1:13:59] assert
[1:14:01] exclusivity let me tell you a little
[1:14:03] story I I I used to work with a fellow I
[1:14:05] worked for a very small company in
[1:14:06] California for a number of years and we
[1:14:08] had a very small engineering team and it
[1:14:11] was this other fellow and myself and
[1:14:13] there were one or two other people that
[1:14:14] helped from time to time and we
[1:14:16] developed a lot of products but that's
[1:14:18] not what this is about the point is that
[1:14:20] this fellow that I worked with he he his
[1:14:23] his mother was a preacher in the
[1:14:25] Unitarian Church which basically says
[1:14:28] make up your own religion you're welcome
[1:14:30] here so he told me that well about the
[1:14:32] age 12 he stopped believing in Jesus and
[1:14:35] and he had a little bit of this attitude
[1:14:37] and I think that he was an agnostic
[1:14:39] trying to be an atheist or or or
[1:14:41] something like that and so we had a
[1:14:44] number of discussions and and and and
[1:14:46] and and I early on realized that this
[1:14:49] wasn't this and it wasn't this but I I I
[1:14:54] would say to to him when he would bring
[1:14:56] something up I'd say Wayne I I I
[1:14:58] appreciate you're sharing that with me
[1:15:00] as a person of faith I see it this
[1:15:03] way oh yeah there's a cross on the front
[1:15:05] of the pulpit it's about perspective
[1:15:08] right those of you here Sunday morning
[1:15:09] know that reference so so what so I
[1:15:13] would explain to him where I was coming
[1:15:15] from I'd understand where he was coming
[1:15:17] from but I wasn't trying to persuade him
[1:15:19] he was wrong and I was right or the
[1:15:21] other way just so we could understand
[1:15:23] each other and then we could set that
[1:15:25] aside and walk together as Engineers
[1:15:28] developing some pretty amazing products
[1:15:30] as a very small team where we had to
[1:15:32] cooperate very very closely we became
[1:15:35] very close over the years that we worked
[1:15:37] together even though we're very very
[1:15:39] different people so this doesn't mean
[1:15:41] you have to be in lock step or agreement
[1:15:43] with somebody but what's your motive
[1:15:45] what's your objective how can two walk
[1:15:48] together except they'd be
[1:15:51] agreed will a lion roar in the forest
[1:15:54] when he hath no prey will a young lion
[1:15:57] cry out of his den if he had taken
[1:16:00] nothing again I I and the business that
[1:16:04] I was in when I lived in Tucson more
[1:16:06] decades ago than I care to think about
[1:16:08] used to go to South Africa fairly
[1:16:10] regularly on business and i' go into uh
[1:16:14] uh Krueger Park from time to time and
[1:16:16] and go up in someplace where you can get
[1:16:17] out of your car
[1:16:19] and nobody catches you can get out of
[1:16:21] your car and and you can observe it and
[1:16:24] here's springb walk over here these deer
[1:16:26] that are feeding and here's a pride of
[1:16:27] lions over here and the lions are very
[1:16:32] quiet and you see the lionist leave the
[1:16:38] pride
[1:16:39] stealthily absolutely quietly
[1:16:42] downwind from the deer and the deer they
[1:16:46] sense something's going
[1:16:48] on very quiet until the lion Springs and
[1:16:51] maybe it catches prey and and maybe it
[1:16:53] doesn't but it brings that prey back
[1:16:57] then the Lions make noise we're having
[1:17:00] our dinner stay away or you'll be
[1:17:03] next the Lions don't make noise when
[1:17:06] they're doing about their business so
[1:17:07] he's saying a lion doesn't Roar without
[1:17:10] a
[1:17:11] reason okay same thing can a bird fall
[1:17:15] in a snare upon the earth when there's
[1:17:17] no trap set for him there's there's no
[1:17:20] bait shall one take up a snare from the
[1:17:22] earth and have taken nothing at all the
[1:17:25] the trap on the earth isn't going to
[1:17:26] Spring unless something steps on it the
[1:17:29] bird's not going to fly into oh that
[1:17:31] looks like a trap I think I'll just fly
[1:17:32] into thatn there's got to be something
[1:17:34] to draw it in we we at our house every
[1:17:37] now and then we've had pack routes
[1:17:38] around and I put out live traps for
[1:17:40] those things and and and that's how I
[1:17:42] catch them and if I don't put bait in
[1:17:44] the Trap it's empty in the morning I'm
[1:17:46] glad when the trap's empty but not
[1:17:48] because I forgot the
[1:17:50] bait
[1:17:52] so let's move on to the next next one
[1:17:55] shall a trumpet be blown in the city and
[1:17:58] the people not be afraid that was the
[1:18:00] warning that an enemy is
[1:18:03] approaching shall there be evil in this
[1:18:05] city and the Lord hath not done it he
[1:18:07] hasn't allowed it he hasn't planned
[1:18:10] it verse seven surely the Lord God will
[1:18:14] do nothing but he revealeth his secret
[1:18:16] into his servants of prophets that
[1:18:17] doesn't mean that God isn't going to do
[1:18:19] anything the prophet's got to do it all
[1:18:20] it's not saying that at all he's saying
[1:18:23] before the Lord does anything anything
[1:18:25] he'll warn he'll tell His prophets just
[1:18:29] like Amos here is warning Israel about
[1:18:32] what's going to happen if they don't
[1:18:33] wake up and pay attention then the Lord
[1:18:36] goes ahead and does it the prophet
[1:18:37] doesn't do it the Lord does it he always
[1:18:40] warns us before Calamity this whole book
[1:18:43] of Amos is just that a warning a call to
[1:18:47] repentance and reform it's not because
[1:18:49] God wants to punish the
[1:18:52] people the lion ha roared
[1:18:55] almost goes on and says this is the
[1:18:57] conditions under which a lion roars the
[1:18:59] lion has roared he has his prey don't
[1:19:03] approach him or he'll attack you like a
[1:19:04] rattlesnake rattling the Lord has
[1:19:08] spoken who can but
[1:19:12] prophesy publish in the Palaces at
[1:19:14] ashdod these are not their friends and
[1:19:16] in the Palaces in the land of Egypt and
[1:19:19] say assemble yourselves upon the
[1:19:20] mountains of Samaria Samaria was the
[1:19:23] capital of Israel behold the great
[1:19:25] tumults in the midst thereof and the
[1:19:27] oppressed in the midst
[1:19:29] thereof witness the open oppression of
[1:19:31] the weak the chaos that is in
[1:19:35] Israel for they know not to do right
[1:19:39] sayith the Lord they who store up
[1:19:41] violence and robbery what they have
[1:19:43] taken and looted in their palaces and
[1:19:46] their
[1:19:47] strongholds
[1:19:49] therefore because of this
[1:19:51] oppression thus sayeth the Lord and add
[1:19:54] adversary shall there'll be even round
[1:19:56] about the land and he shall bring down
[1:19:59] thy strength from thee and thy palaces
[1:20:02] thy stronghold shall be spoiled you the
[1:20:05] one that's going to be looted now thus
[1:20:08] saith the Lord as the shepherd taketh
[1:20:10] out of the mouth of the lion two legs or
[1:20:13] a piece of an
[1:20:15] ear so shall the children of Israel be
[1:20:17] taken out that dwell in Samaria in the
[1:20:19] corner of a bed and in Damascus and a
[1:20:21] couch there'll be a tiny Remnant that
[1:20:24] that will survive these coming
[1:20:28] disasters hear ye and testify in the
[1:20:32] house of Jacob saith the Lord God the
[1:20:34] god of hosts that in the day that I
[1:20:36] shall visit the transgressions of Israel
[1:20:39] upon him I will also visit the altars of
[1:20:41] bethl the the idol worship established
[1:20:44] when the nation was divided and the
[1:20:46] horns the power the horns of the altar
[1:20:48] shall be cut off and fall to the ground
[1:20:50] no one worships the idol at bethl
[1:20:52] anymore the horns of that altar have
[1:20:54] been
[1:20:55] broken and I will Smite the winter house
[1:20:58] with the summer house and the houses of
[1:21:00] ivory Shall Perish and the great houses
[1:21:02] shall have an end sayeth the Lord the
[1:21:05] houses of the wealthy the houses of the
[1:21:07] corrupt the oppressors of the people
[1:21:10] they'll be
[1:21:12] destroyed that's chapter
[1:21:14] three in chapter four The Lord continues
[1:21:18] to plead with Israel he even uses
[1:21:20] sarcasm to gain their attention now we
[1:21:23] know we've heard examples where the Lord
[1:21:25] has a sense of humor did you know that
[1:21:27] he uses
[1:21:29] sarcasm
[1:21:30] look Amos 44 the Lord is speaking come
[1:21:34] to bethl and transgress at gilo multiply
[1:21:38] transgression bring your sacrifices
[1:21:40] every morning in your tithes after three
[1:21:43] years offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving
[1:21:46] with leaven and Proclaim and publish the
[1:21:49] free offerings tell everybody what
[1:21:51] you've done how big of an offering you
[1:21:53] made for this is what you like to do oh
[1:21:56] ye children of Israel sayeth the Lord
[1:21:59] he's not telling them to go there and do
[1:22:02] that sarcasm I thought it was
[1:22:05] interesting that the Lord would speak in
[1:22:07] such a way just to get their attention
[1:22:10] they don't seem to be listening any
[1:22:12] other way the Lord continues in this
[1:22:15] chapter to call attention to every
[1:22:16] device he has used to get their
[1:22:18] attention since they ignore the law and
[1:22:21] the prophets verse six I also have given
[1:22:24] you cleanness of teeth in all your
[1:22:26] cities that doesn't mean he sent them
[1:22:27] dentists and want of bread in all your
[1:22:31] palaces yet ye have not returned unto me
[1:22:33] sayeth the Lord in other words he's used
[1:22:35] famine to get their attention your teeth
[1:22:38] are clean because you got nothing to
[1:22:40] eat I've withheld
[1:22:42] rain yet you have not returned to me
[1:22:45] I've sent mildew and
[1:22:47] pestilence yet you have not returned to
[1:22:50] me I've sent Palmer worms to destroy
[1:22:52] your Vines and fruit trees I've over
[1:22:54] thrown some of you I've slain your young
[1:22:56] men with a sword yet ye have not
[1:22:59] returned to me return means
[1:23:02] repent therefore verse 12 thus will I do
[1:23:06] unto thee oh Israel and because I will
[1:23:09] do this unto thee prepare to meet thy
[1:23:12] God o
[1:23:13] Israel but they seem to have forgotten
[1:23:16] who God is so he identifies himself for
[1:23:20] Lo he that forth the mountains and
[1:23:22] createth the wind and declareth unto man
[1:23:25] what is his thought that maketh the
[1:23:27] morning darkness and treadeth upon the
[1:23:29] high places of the Earth the Lord the
[1:23:32] god of hosts is his name I'm the one
[1:23:35] that did all this that's giving you this
[1:23:39] warning chapter
[1:23:41] five pointing out the error and
[1:23:43] wickedness it abounds in Israel the Lord
[1:23:46] keeps appealing to them leaving the door
[1:23:49] open for repentance
[1:23:52] reform righteousness just a few sections
[1:23:55] for verse four thus saith the Lord unto
[1:23:57] the house of Israel seek me and ye shall
[1:24:02] live verse six seek the Lord and ye
[1:24:05] shall live lest he break out like fire
[1:24:08] in the house of Joseph Joseph is used
[1:24:11] here as as a synonym if you will for
[1:24:14] Israel represents the northern kingdom
[1:24:16] Joseph's children ephra and Manasseh had
[1:24:19] their inheritance and they had the
[1:24:21] largest inheritance in the Northern
[1:24:23] Kingdom of Israel
[1:24:25] lest I break out I he break out like
[1:24:27] fire in the house of Joseph and devoured
[1:24:29] and there be none to quench it and bethl
[1:24:32] focus of idol
[1:24:34] worship ye who turn judgment Justice to
[1:24:38] Wormwood and leave off righteousness and
[1:24:41] the
[1:24:42] Earth verse 10 they they hate him that
[1:24:45] rebuke in the gate they abore him that
[1:24:47] speaketh uprightly they hate Justice
[1:24:51] they abore the righteous for as much
[1:24:53] therefore as your treading is upon the
[1:24:56] poor and you take from him burdens of
[1:24:59] wheat corruption bribes excessive
[1:25:02] taxation ye have built houses of heed
[1:25:06] Stone but you shall not dwell in them ye
[1:25:09] have planted Pleasant Vineyards but ye
[1:25:12] shall not drink the wine of them for I
[1:25:15] know your manifold transgressions and
[1:25:17] your Mighty sins they afflict the just
[1:25:20] they take a bribe they turn aside the
[1:25:22] poor in the gate from their right but
[1:25:25] even even in all this seek good and not
[1:25:29] evil that she may live and so the Lord
[1:25:33] the god of hosts shall be with you as
[1:25:35] you have spoken hate the evil love the
[1:25:39] good establish judgment in the gate it
[1:25:43] may be that the Lord of hosts will be
[1:25:44] gracious unto the remnant of Joseph of
[1:25:49] Israel and then building up to what I
[1:25:51] called our theme verse
[1:25:54] the Lord is speaking again to them he
[1:25:56] says I hate no I despise your feast days
[1:26:01] I will not smell your solemn assemblies
[1:26:04] though ye offer me burnt offerings and
[1:26:06] your meat offerings I will not accept
[1:26:08] them neither will I regard the peace
[1:26:11] offerings of your fat beasts take thou
[1:26:14] away from me the noise of thy songs I
[1:26:17] will not hear The Melody of thy vials
[1:26:20] but let judgment run down as Waters
[1:26:23] righteous
[1:26:25] as a mighty
[1:26:28] stream chapter six begins with woe to
[1:26:31] them that are at EAS in Zion he he
[1:26:33] describes their ostentatious luxury uh
[1:26:36] they that drink wine and bowls anoint
[1:26:39] themselves with the chief ointments but
[1:26:41] they are not grieved for the Affliction
[1:26:45] of Joseph of Israel therefore now shall
[1:26:48] they go captive with the first that go
[1:26:51] captive and the banquet of them that
[1:26:53] stretch themselves stretched out on the
[1:26:55] couches shall be
[1:26:59] removed in chapter 7 almost has two
[1:27:03] visions in which he pleads with the Lord
[1:27:04] to Spirit rer the Lord says I'm going to
[1:27:06] do this and Amos almost says Lord Israel
[1:27:11] is small and weak please don't destroy
[1:27:14] him and the Lord says okay you're right
[1:27:17] I won't do that so that happens twice
[1:27:20] reminds us of Moses a third Vision ends
[1:27:23] this way almost
[1:27:25] 79 and the high places of Isaac again
[1:27:28] representing Israel shall be desolate
[1:27:30] and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be
[1:27:33] laid waste and I will rise against the
[1:27:35] house the dynasty of jeroboam with the
[1:27:41] sword verse 10 then amziah the priest of
[1:27:45] beel sent to jeroboam king of Israel
[1:27:47] saying Amos hath conspired against thee
[1:27:50] in the midst of the House of Israel the
[1:27:53] land is not able to Bear all his words
[1:27:56] remember his name means burdensome and
[1:27:58] he's delivering that burden for thus
[1:28:01] saith Amos jeroboam shall die by The
[1:28:04] Sword and Israel shall surely be led
[1:28:07] away captive out of their own
[1:28:10] land also amziah said to Amos oh thou
[1:28:14] sear
[1:28:15] go go flee thee away into the land of
[1:28:19] Judah and there eat bread and prophesy
[1:28:21] there but prophesy not again anymore at
[1:28:25] bethl for it is the King's Chapel and it
[1:28:28] is the King's
[1:28:31] Court then answered Amos and said to
[1:28:34] amziah was no Prophet neither was I a
[1:28:36] prophet's son I was a Herdman a gatherer
[1:28:39] of sycamore fruit the Lord took me as I
[1:28:42] followed the flock and the Lord said to
[1:28:43] me go prophesy unto My People
[1:28:47] Israel now I'm Messiah therefore hear
[1:28:51] thou the word of the Lord thou sayest
[1:28:55] prophesy not against Israel and drop not
[1:28:57] Thy word against the house of Isaac
[1:29:00] Israel therefore thus saith the Lord thy
[1:29:04] wife shall be in harlot in the city thy
[1:29:06] sons and thy daughters shall fall By The
[1:29:08] Sword and thy land shall be divided by
[1:29:11] line and thou shalt die in a polluted
[1:29:13] land and Israel shall surely go into
[1:29:15] captivity forth of his
[1:29:17] land you can send me away but it's not
[1:29:21] going to change anything
[1:29:24] chapter
[1:29:26] 8 the theme
[1:29:28] continues verse four hear this oh ye
[1:29:31] that swallow up the needy even to make
[1:29:34] the poor of the land to fail saying when
[1:29:38] will the new moon be gone that we may
[1:29:40] sell grain and the Sabbath that we may
[1:29:44] set forth wheat making the epath small
[1:29:47] and the Shuckle great and falsifying the
[1:29:49] balances by deceit fewer goods for more
[1:29:53] money does that sound familiar kind of
[1:29:55] like shrink flation I I grab my my my H
[1:29:59] gallon jug of orange juice that I get at
[1:30:02] Costco it used to be 64 oun now it's 59
[1:30:05] ooun price didn't go down but there's
[1:30:08] less of it
[1:30:11] okay that we may buy the poor for silver
[1:30:15] and the needy for a pair of shoes yay
[1:30:18] and sell The Refuge of the wheat in
[1:30:21] other words they're selling wheat
[1:30:22] they're selling grain but the chaff
[1:30:24] that's supposed to be taken away from
[1:30:25] the threshing floor they're missing the
[1:30:27] chaff with the wheat they're giving bad
[1:30:29] grain they're they're stuffing it
[1:30:31] they're diluting it they're polluting
[1:30:34] it the Lord has sworn by the Excellency
[1:30:37] of Jacob surely I will never when never
[1:30:42] forget any of their
[1:30:45] works well skipping down to verse 11
[1:30:48] remember what amziah told Amos to go
[1:30:51] back to Judah and not prophesy to Israel
[1:30:54] again we just read that in chapter
[1:30:56] 7
[1:30:58] 811 behold the days come sayeth the Lord
[1:31:02] that I will send a famine in the land
[1:31:05] not a famine of bread nor a thirst of
[1:31:08] water but of hearing the words of the
[1:31:12] Lord and and they shall Wander from sea
[1:31:15] to Sea and from the north even to the
[1:31:16] east they shall run to and fro and seek
[1:31:19] the word of the Lord and shall not find
[1:31:22] it brother Bram quoted this many times
[1:31:26] identify it as being in the last days
[1:31:28] and being in his lifetime and it was
[1:31:31] manifested as
[1:31:32] denomination division a lack of courage
[1:31:36] to say the
[1:31:38] truth where are we
[1:31:41] now well the concluding chapter is
[1:31:44] chapter nine it starts with the prophecy
[1:31:47] of the destruction of the northern
[1:31:48] kingdom but ends with the promise of the
[1:31:52] restoration of the
[1:31:56] people starting at at verse eight behold
[1:32:00] the eyes of the Lord were upon the
[1:32:01] sinful Kingdom and I will destroy it
[1:32:05] from off the face of the Earth saving
[1:32:07] that I will not utterly destroy the
[1:32:10] house of Jacob I'll destroy the kingdom
[1:32:12] but I'll save some of the people for lo
[1:32:15] I will command I will sift the house of
[1:32:18] Israel among all nations like as grain
[1:32:21] is sifted in a Sie yet shall not the
[1:32:24] least grain fall upon the
[1:32:27] Earth all the Sinners of my people shall
[1:32:31] die by the sword which say oh the evil
[1:32:34] shall never overtake or stop us and the
[1:32:38] final the closing message of Hope the
[1:32:41] promise of
[1:32:44] restoration and that day I will raise up
[1:32:48] the Tabernacle of David that is fallen
[1:32:51] and close up the breaches thereof and
[1:32:53] and I will raise up his ruins and I will
[1:32:56] build it as in the days of old that they
[1:32:58] may possess the remnant of Edom and of
[1:33:01] all the he Heathen which are called by
[1:33:04] my name the Heathen called by my name
[1:33:07] that's
[1:33:08] us that's
[1:33:10] us Stephen when he was being martyred in
[1:33:13] Acts 15 that's he quoted this and said
[1:33:16] this is the Gentiles that are coming
[1:33:17] into the Lord
[1:33:19] now which are called by my name sayith
[1:33:22] the Lord that doeth this behold the days
[1:33:24] come sayeth the Lord that the plowman
[1:33:27] shall overtake the reaper the Treader of
[1:33:29] grapes him that se his seed and the
[1:33:31] mountain shall drop sweet wine and all
[1:33:33] the hills shall melt in other words the
[1:33:36] barren lands will become exceedingly
[1:33:38] fruitful you'll still be harvesting when
[1:33:40] the guy's coming out to sew more seed
[1:33:45] because it's so
[1:33:46] Bountiful if you're taking notes that's
[1:33:48] Leviticus 26 verse5 and Joel 3 ver8
[1:33:54] and I will bring again the Captivity in
[1:33:57] other words I will
[1:33:59] restore my people of Israel that I can
[1:34:01] go become captives again he's going to
[1:34:03] take them from captivity they're going
[1:34:05] to be restored brought again and they
[1:34:08] shall build the waste cities and inhabit
[1:34:11] them they shall plant Vineyards and
[1:34:14] drink the wine thereof they shall also
[1:34:16] make Gardens and eat the fruit of
[1:34:19] them and I will plant them upon their
[1:34:22] land and and they shall no more be
[1:34:25] pulled up out of their land which I have
[1:34:27] given them sayith the Lord thy
[1:34:32] God what a beautiful promise the amazing
[1:34:36] grace of our Lord the musicians would
[1:34:41] would please
[1:34:44] come what lessons can we take home from
[1:34:48] Amos while Amos prophecies are directed
[1:34:51] to Israel the northern kingdom they give
[1:34:53] us a clear view from the Lord's
[1:34:56] perspective of what's
[1:34:58] important in addition to honest worship
[1:35:01] of the Lord how we treat each other
[1:35:04] especially those who are in some sense
[1:35:06] under our care or protection or less
[1:35:09] fortunate is very
[1:35:11] important I'll close by rereading from
[1:35:15] Matthew's
[1:35:16] gospel Jesus said unto him Thou shalt
[1:35:19] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:35:23] with all thy soul with all thy mind this
[1:35:27] is the first and great commandment and
[1:35:29] the second is like unto it Thou shalt
[1:35:31] love thy neighbor as thyself on these
[1:35:35] two Commandments hang all the law and
[1:35:39] the
[1:35:40] prophets I think these words of Jesus
[1:35:43] summarize the Book of
[1:35:45] Amos
[1:35:48] eloquently I think that's a lesson for
[1:35:51] us for today
[1:35:54] and with that thought that context let's
[1:35:57] close this portion of the service and
[1:35:59] pass it back to brother Daniel as we
[1:36:01] worship and song with a song that we
[1:36:04] used to sing back around 70
[1:36:07] 7172 every week the Youth of the church
[1:36:10] would get together and we'd sing songs
[1:36:12] and back in those days my hands work and
[1:36:14] I even played the guitar um but the
[1:36:17] Friday evening youth Gatherings back
[1:36:19] then we sang this song it shall flow
[1:36:22] like a river I don't know if you know it
[1:36:24] but that's the entire song it's not hard
[1:36:27] and we'll sing it two or three times so
[1:36:29] that you can get the hang of it about
[1:36:31] the time you've got it will probably
[1:36:34] stop it shall
[1:36:36] flow like a
[1:36:39] river it shall
[1:36:41] fall like the
[1:36:44] rain it shall rise as the Jew in the
[1:36:51] morning or the
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] for the
[1:36:57] know of the
[1:36:59] Lord shall
[1:37:02] fill all the
[1:37:04] earth and the
[1:37:07] spirit of the
[1:37:09] Lord shall
[1:37:11] [Music]
[1:37:15] fall it shall
[1:37:17] flow like a
[1:37:20] river it shall fall
[1:37:23] like the
[1:37:25] rain it shall rise as the Dew in the
[1:37:32] morning over the
[1:37:35] plain for the
[1:37:38] knowledge of the
[1:37:40] Lord shall
[1:37:43] fill all the
[1:37:45] earth and the
[1:37:48] spirit of the
[1:37:50] Lord shall fall
[1:37:54] once
[1:37:56] more it shall
[1:37:58] flow like a
[1:38:01] river it shall
[1:38:03] fall like the
[1:38:06] rain it shall
[1:38:08] rise as the
[1:38:11] do in the
[1:38:13] morning or the
[1:38:16] plain for the
[1:38:19] know of the Lord shall f
[1:38:25] all the
[1:38:26] earth and the
[1:38:29] spirit of the
[1:38:31] Lord shall fall
[1:38:37] amen you like The Book of Amos yes it's
[1:38:41] a it's a powerful book it's full of
[1:38:43] Prophecy it's full of
[1:38:45] Correction I I
[1:38:46] think I don't mean to say that that um
[1:38:51] we've heard it before but it seems like
[1:38:54] every book that we go through the Bible
[1:38:56] says the same thing over and over I
[1:39:00] think the Amos can be summed
[1:39:04] up I think it was
[1:39:07] um One A Familiar verse that we all know
[1:39:10] Amos 8 verse 11 says this behold the
[1:39:14] days come sayeth the Lord that I will
[1:39:16] send a famine in the land and not a
[1:39:18] famine of bread nor a thirst for water
[1:39:21] but of hearing the words of the Lord
[1:39:24] when we neglect that is when we open the
[1:39:27] door for sin to come into our lives
[1:39:30] that's when we open the door for failure
[1:39:33] to manifest itself it's when we open the
[1:39:35] door for our children to go astray is
[1:39:38] when we lose track of the word of the
[1:39:41] Lord and it becomes a rare thing in our
[1:39:44] homes it becomes a rare thing in our
[1:39:45] churches it becomes a rare thing in our
[1:39:48] lives and
[1:39:50] then go back over to Amos chap 5
[1:39:53] 5 verse
[1:39:55] 14 and here is the repeat over and over
[1:40:01] in the book in whether it be the Minor
[1:40:04] Prophets whether it be Isaiah whether it
[1:40:08] be in in the
[1:40:10] Chronicles it's always the same
[1:40:13] thing seek good and not
[1:40:17] evil and love the good I'm sorry and
[1:40:20] seek good and not evil that you may live
[1:40:24] and and so the Lord the god of hosts
[1:40:27] shall be with you as you have spoken
[1:40:30] hate the evil and love the good and
[1:40:34] establish judgment in the gate it may be
[1:40:37] that the Lord God of hosts will be
[1:40:40] gracious unto the remnant of
[1:40:44] Joseph Brothers and Sisters the
[1:40:47] book it repeats itself over and over and
[1:40:51] brother Lyall and I can come up here and
[1:40:53] we can go through each book of the Bible
[1:40:54] like we're going and we can learn about
[1:40:57] each learn about the prophet we can
[1:40:59] learn about the historic context of the
[1:41:02] book and and of jeroboam II and how evil
[1:41:05] he was and how the people would stray
[1:41:09] from the Lord but it history has a way
[1:41:12] of repeating itself from the Garden of
[1:41:15] Eden when they
[1:41:18] wanted evil rather than
[1:41:21] good and then over and over and over
[1:41:25] brother Dennis it just happens back over
[1:41:28] and over and over again that the people
[1:41:31] want evil instead of good and then God
[1:41:34] steps on the scene and brings hardship
[1:41:38] and it usually turns them back turns
[1:41:41] them back to the Lord Brother Dennis you
[1:41:44] come up and
[1:41:46] close um brother Mark s sister Martha
[1:41:50] right God bless you welcome we
[1:41:53] appreciate you joining us brother Dennis
[1:41:55] come on up and
[1:41:57] close we um we go through we're going
[1:42:00] through the Bible chapter by or book by
[1:42:03] book and on Wednesday night bible study
[1:42:06] brother Theo and I are trading off and
[1:42:09] uh we're going Prophet by Propet book by
[1:42:11] book and uh it's it just more and more
[1:42:16] it hammers at home that when there is
[1:42:19] that famine in the land that famine for
[1:42:22] hearing the word of God and brothers and
[1:42:23] sisters it's not like like we heard in
[1:42:27] Joel where it was a swarm of locust that
[1:42:30] came through this famine for the word we
[1:42:33] bring upon
[1:42:34] ourselves because we don't spend the
[1:42:37] time we don't spend the time in prayer
[1:42:39] we don't spend the time in study we
[1:42:41] don't spend the time hearing the word
[1:42:44] and we bring these hardships upon us but
[1:42:47] God's a good god he's a loving God and
[1:42:50] even though we may stray
[1:42:54] just as our children stray
[1:42:57] sometime and we have to punish them to
[1:42:59] bring them back God is a loving God and
[1:43:03] he will he he brings us back through
[1:43:05] hardship as he's done with Israel every
[1:43:07] time and uh it's going to happen
[1:43:11] again but I thank God that the blood of
[1:43:15] Jesus Christ is upon us and even though
[1:43:18] in my failures and my faults I thank God
[1:43:21] that that he has
[1:43:23] his love brings chastisement to me to my
[1:43:28] family and uh we should we should always
[1:43:31] thank God for not just the prosperous
[1:43:35] times but also think thank God when he
[1:43:38] brings chastisement upon us and the
[1:43:41] hardships come and it makes us just look
[1:43:43] more towards him let's all stand
