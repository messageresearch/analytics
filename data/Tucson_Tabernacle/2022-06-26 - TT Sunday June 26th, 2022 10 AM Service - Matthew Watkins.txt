this in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen the scripture tells us in isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement for our peace was laid upon him and by his stripes we are healed and i was thinking about that he was wounded because i would get wounded he was hurt because i would hurt and then he could be touched by the feeling of my infirmities anything you're going through any any hard times any any problems and he went through them so he would have that understanding he says i am your i'm your help in the time of trouble and i appreciate that about him today amen oh how he loves you and me amen [Music] he loves you and me and he gave his life [Music] oh how he loves you and me and oh how he loves and me oh how

hallelujahs grow help me bring the savior's praises far and wide for i've opened up towards heaven all the windows of my soul and i'm living on the hallelujah sun though the world may sweep around me

what a place to be you may be seated thank you you got two choices where you're going to live you're going to live on his side or you're going to live on the other side amen [Music] we have a couple of requests to bring to your attention here do that now sister carly koba put a prayer request in for brother simrock he says he was test positive for covid last week and he fell down i guess it was i don't know if that was this morning yesterday and he was taken to the er by ambulance and his blood pressure was very low his oxygen level was low and he was dehydrated and also with pneumonia so sister carly was asking us to remember brother simrock this morning and i he was part of this congregation for many years and i know he's back in north carolina i believe now with the family back there so we'll remember him and then brother jeremy maggot says please pray for a neighbor who has lost their son and one lost their mom grandma and daughter all the same person so and then he puts his uh a good banana nut bread maker and you know you read like that and you i thought about it a bit i said but there are things that we're remembered for there are things that that reached out and touched somebody and i believe as brother jeremy is asking for them there's may god bless this family or help this person to think that and um and also he says to remember sister roberta as she's uh claiming victory over shingles amen every need is supplied every need is met anything that you would have and say lord i'm going through this time i'm having a hard time through this or it may be like you can't see light through the tunnel sometimes but there'll be another turn and there will be light at the end of the tunnel you have a need just maybe as your seed say lord remember me lord remember someone that i have on my heart i know eunice's husband sean is flying a transport plane and crosses all over the country and actually overseas and all and everyone has a need everyone need needs god to be with him at all times so lord this this morning lord just thinking about brother simrock going back with the memories as a group of young people we used to get together at the park and play softball quite a bit and he was always the pitcher there and here at the school with the kids and got to get to know him as a good friend and a good brother lord and today he's suffering in the hospital lord and er we're asking for your mercy and your grace to reach over in touch lord that healing virtue flow through his body even now lord may faith take hold of your promise lord and brother jeremy requesting here for someone who lost a mom a grandma a whole part of a family lord would you be their comfort would you be their strength today lord sometimes a peace be on our own understanding we couldn't say why but lord it's something that you provide for us lord and every hand raised in every heart represented here lord those listening in lord those that raise their hand at home today lord would you minister to them lord as you know best we ask in jesus christ's name amen what a mighty god we serve amen he's when the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin amen i am thinking of the rapture in our blessed home on high when the redeemed [Music] our gathering [Music] from all sins how we will shout and how we will stand when the redeemed our gathering hands there will be a great procession over on the streets of gold when the redeemed are gathering oh what music oh what's singing or that city will be wrong when the redeemed are gathering

redeemed are gathering then the angels always listen for they cannot join that song when they redeemed our gatherings when they're [Music] redeemed are gathering [Applause] [Music] and how [Music] then the savior will give orders to prepare the [Music] and we'll hear his invitation comedy [Music] [Applause] [Music] when oh when the readings are gathering and if you're one of those raise your hand say [Music] and how we will sing when our gatherings amen i'm one of those are you one of those same and washed by the blood you know they come from the east and west they come from the lands of four to feast with a king to dine as his guest [Music] they come from the east and where [Music] how blessed these pilgrims are [Music] divine blessed partakers [Music] [Music] stand no longer nor death in that good lament my savior has gone before preparing the way for me soon will be to part no more through time or eternity [Music] since jesus has set me free i'm happy as heart can be no longer are there the burden of care his yoke is so sweet to me my soul was as black as none but darkness has taken flight now i shout the victory for jesus has set me the gates of that holy place stand open by night and day all look to the lord more grace whose love has prepared the world a home in those mansions fair his hand has reserved for [Music] since jesus has set me free i'm happy as heart can be no longer i bear the burden of care his yoke is so sweet to me my soul was as black as night my darkness has taken flight now i shout the victory for jesus has set me free amen what a day that'll be amen and it's not going to be standing at the door how did you make it and we all made it in by the grace of god amen appreciate that god's goodness to us amen we have brother matthew watkins and his family with us today and brother matt will be ministering this morning and this this evening lord willing so brother matt sent forwarded to to us and i didn't get a chance to ask him where he got it but there's a recording of brother green in 1968 speaking at the full gospels businessman's up up in phoenix and i'd maybe maybe this wednesday we could play it's about a 20-minute clip of of the excitement in his voice i i heard brother green again how especially when he's a younger man the excitement of getting know what god has done for us in this day and age but even more than that a god being real and personal to each individual rather than well he was good for brother brandon was good but no but he's good for me too so possibly maybe on wednesday night we could play that little portion of it it was just encouraging to see that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen but sometimes you know we get to thinking why why lord why this how come and i opened the the song book and fell on farther along will understand we'll understand why we'll know maybe on that side looking back and saying that's why that's why you had this in mind god bless farther along tempted [Music] why it should be all the day long while there are living about [Music] farther along we'll know [Music] cheer up my [Music] i'm [Music] it leaves our homes [Music] living so farther along we'll know all about [Music] cheer up my brother [Music] faithful till death few more days [Music] as we sweep through the beautiful [Music] farther along [Music] will understand [Music] you know sometimes we do ask the lord why but he knows best he's already seen the end from the beginning he's seen you on the other side already rejoicing that i appreciate that so good to have each one of you here and brother matt sister rachel good to see you in the family with the man saying here rachel used to be duel good to see you all here god bless you lord's been good to us how many can say man lord's been good to us sometimes we don't understand some of the things we go through and why but therefore a purpose and a reason been working with steven now at work and it's been about a month now and trying to show him these are the things you're going to have to do down the road just didn't think we'd have to do them all in four weeks it's been quite busy but you know sometimes god god leads us along and and he takes us to a place where when that time and that trial that thing comes you're ready because you know god keeps you and he takes care of you so if we'll stand together and you know we we see the things that are happening and we we see what just supreme court did and what this country and even the whole world's reaction to what has happened but god said it would be that way he said these things she would they would turn against god so it's not a surprise but it's a hurt but all these things are pointing to a soon coming of our lord and savior jesus christ so cheer up my brother and live in the sunshine we'll say yes lord you knew what was best for us so set your wings on the winds of faith [Music] because that's how you soar above all these things there are two roads [Music] you may take a one by [Music] oh take the word of god or what you see [Applause] what you believe [Music] is what will be so set your wings oh the winds of faith you can fly to a higher place do not struggle it's my grace [Music] your wings to the winds of faith and watch your knees [Music] watch your mountain much too high speak the word of god [Music] and my [Music] [Applause] set your wings to the winds of faith you can fly in a higher place [Music] do not struggle it's my grace [Music] watch the eagle in the sky he does not struggle he does not strive for the power that makes him rise already [Music] let's sing it with our hands raised now set set your wish to the winds of faith you can fly in a higher place do not struggle it's yes lord set your wings to the winds of faith could we sing that song nobody loves you like you love me jesus nobody uh let's start with a verse actually morning i see you in the sun rise every morning and it's like a picture that you've painted for me love letter i love a letter in the sky sing that second verse story or story i could have had a really different story you came down from heaven to restore me forever save my life raise your hands now sing it to the lord nobody loves me like you do oh nobody loves me like you love me jesus and not standing o at your amazing ways and i worship you as long as i am breathing god you are faithful and true nobody loves me like you do mountains oh let's worship him now oh mountains you're breaking down the weight of all my mountains and even when it feels like i'm surround here's a promise oh you never leave my side [Music] nobody loves me like you love me jesus oh and i stand in all at your amazing ways i worship you as long as i am breathing god you are faithful and true one more time nobody loves me like you and nobody loves me like you love me jesus and i stand in o at your amaze lord oh i worship you as long as i am breathing god you are faithful and true nobody loves me like you do give him a praise offering if you love him hallelujah oh come on friends give him a real offering of praise how many can say thank you lord nobody loves me love me amen nobody knows me like he knows me i'm glad i serve a god who knows me from my inside out knows every part of me and loves every part of me amen praise the lord god bless you amen good to be here in the house of the lord can i just take a minute and look at all your faces before we read our scripture i hope you're as happy to see me as i'm happy to see you amen give the lord a hand amen praise the lord amen always just a privilege to come here and minister at the tucson tabernacle i was but aaron was mentioning there what i shared someone shared with me uh brother green speaking there at the full gospel businessman you'll get a chance i think to hear that you said wednesday and it was just uh something i began to just meditate on that even on the way i was listening to it in the airplane flying here and i thought my goodness how privileged we are that there were men who came before us long before maybe some of you or some of you uh even the little ones here today weren't even live but there were faithful men of god who held this truth stood for this truth preached this truth defended this truth and now you're a product of their of of their labor and their efforts and what they went through were a product of grace amen i'm certainly thankful for that hearing meditating and pondering that just flying and i thought my all the voices uh that was labored brother green for years behind this pulpit and the men of god even after him the brothers who would come and he would have minister and then to thank even prior to that you know god's prophet amen and i just thought lord i'm just who am i as david said that you would be mindful of me amen what grace is this amen truly we're blessed amen to be called the sons and daughters of god amen it's a privilege to be here with you i hope i could just be myself amen and that'll help me to be comfortable and if i could be comfortable if you can make me feel comfortable then we ought to be able to say lord you ought to feel comfortable amongst us amen come how many could say that raise your hand say lord feel right at home right here not not just in this building right at my seat today would you come and feel comfortable to minister to me amen i know that he will he's always faithful brother ed good to see you brother arne so many if i start calling names i'll get in trouble but uh good to have my family here my mother-in-law my wife my oldest son gideon amen good to have him here with us you love the lord amen romans chapter 7 if you have your bible we're just going to have you turn amen thank you for all that good singing and music amen the worship romans chapter 7. i'd like to just have this uh burden upon my heart while i was uh even while i was flying here but aaron would you mind getting my cell phone in the back there i've i've tethered it to my computer to give me internet but they do have the powerpoint that's wonderful just on the way driving here or flying here um i was the lord just begin to impress this upon my heart and as i was just looking at some of these notes and uh the scripture in romans i was just excited i began to become thank you i was beginning just to become excited to be knowing that i would minister this here today and i don't have uh the top we we only have today this morning and uh and tonight to be able to minister this i actually took this thought and ministered it for a few parts and um and so we only have two services so we don't want to be here through we don't we don't have permission to just preach this morning and just keep going till the night do we bring here no everybody's thinking no he doesn't but here um but we just want to say what the lord has for us to say and then we'll stop and we'll pick it up tonight but i do have a lot upon my heart i'd just like to minister and minister this over a few parts and i'd just like to be able to look at this romans 7 and and if i could say it this way through just studying this and the way the lord just spoke to me throughout the sermon it helped me understand me a little bit better now the lord understands me he understands every part of you he knows the parts that no one else does that only you know and even the lord knows the things about us that maybe we don't even fully understand about ourself you were a complicated creature and especially uh a believer who's who's got a seed gene of god and down inside of them you're complicated and trying to understand yourself and sometimes we we struggle with that and think i don't understand i i've gotta i know that something down inside of me has a desire to be pleasing to the lord and here's what else i know i didn't put that down inside of me but yet i know there's another part of me that struggles and i still battle and i still war with things in it before i came to the lord i how many could witness and be a test to have a testimony here and say before i knew the lord i was just evil my thoughts were evil i i might have had good reason and good parents and a good home but there was a nature down inside of me that just struggled with the things of the flesh and temptations of the flesh and and i was constantly my mind was on evil and and then i met the lord and then the lord saved me and he sanctified me and i'm glad for that but even after that i still find that i still struggle even after i'm born of the spirit of god you could say i know that i've met the lord i know that he's changed something inside of me i know as the woman said brother branham rehearses and he says that she said i may not be who i want to be but i sure ain't who i used to be amen and and so we could say that here today but we could we could look inwardly and say but yet there's still something down on the inside of me that still struggles and i don't understand why if i love the lord and i've got his word i've got his life living inside of me there's still this inward struggle well if you ever felt that way the apostle paul could relate with you really well and we're going to look at it here in verse let's just begin reading here i want to find my place i don't want to read the entire passage here let's just begin reading at verse 14. that'd be a good place to start romans chapter 7 verse 14. i want you as you read this with me to understand it's almost this isn't how paul wrote the letter but as as we begin to read these verses you're going to find it i i've said it this way it's almost like i found a diary of paul and he's going to write it he wasn't expecting anybody to ever read it but he's just expressing his thoughts and he's trying to almost as he expresses that he's he's figuring it out but he doesn't let's just pick it up here at verse 14. for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i can send unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me are you following verse 18. now notice for i know that in me now i want you to focus and key it on this word me because paul is going to begin to divide me into three parts he's not it's not just the when he says me he's not just talking about paul or uh the apostle paul but he's beginning to dissect who he is now watch how he says this here he says in verse 18 for i know that is that in me parentheses that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing how many could testify to that nothing good inside of my flesh for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not or in other words what i don't want to do that i do now if i do verse 20 that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me now notice verse 22 for i now this is another part of him he's speaking of not the part of the flesh that is a no good thing for i delight in the law of god after the inward man so you see what the apostle i know i have you standing but this is important just to lay this in right here you see how the apostle paul begins to divide so what does he begin to tell you there's more to you than what you see in the mirror there is more to you as a believer than what you see what you live with every single day there's another part of you in fact there's two people say brother mad am i schizophrenic i've got two personalities i'm two people well we're going to find out you as a believer born of the spirit of god people say well this was not to the this was not to the born again no it absolutely is the apostle paul is not just talking to a person who's born again he's talking about himself and so he says there's more to me i find that in my flesh there's no good thing and i the things that my inward man says i want to live like the lord but i don't find myself all the time doing that he says here i find that allah verse 21 that when i would do good evils present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring there's an important word if you are not in a war between what you know to do right and what you actually do if that struggle is not there i would say you're in a dangerous spot be thankful there's a struggle down inside of you he says warn against the law of my mind and bring me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am lord we thank you for this reading this passage that we've read we just stopped there lord because it has felt you felt your nearness we've invited you lord in this place lord you inhabit the praises of your people that's where you dwell it's not a building lord we're appreciative of this building this pulpit the stage the music the instruments the musicians the gifts the talents that you have in your family we're thankful there's a roof above us lord where we can come and gather but truly lord that's not your house that's just a building that one day will be destroyed but your house and your tabernacle is in these people who i'm speaking of here today so lord as you're building as your tabernacle we just raise our hands in unity and say lord flow through us holy spirit may your spirit flow through the innermost part of my being may you receive my worship as i enter in now in jesus christ's name and the church said you can be seated this morning so paul and i'm going to just take my time because i know we have the service here tonight and so i'm not going to be in too much of a hurry but i just want to i want to make sure that i get to what what the lord has for us but paul begins to break this down and you can see here he's speaking of a part of himself that he doesn't understand you know that he picks up in romans 8 and he says there's thou there no condemnation to them that are in christ who walk not after the flesh but who live walk after the spirit so there's a part of you that's a true believer that's a true believer of the word of god but yet there's a part of you that lives here today that came to church this morning that struggles in your flesh with the things of sin how many can say amen there was a part maybe some of you had an argument with yourself that you didn't want to come to church today i don't feel like waking up today i don't feel like going to the house of god maybe and the devil will give you every kind of reason and every kind of excuse why you should stay home but there's a spirit down inside of you that said uh uh you i'm not gonna listen to this flesh i'm gonna obey and bring my body subject to the nature that god has changed me with and i'm going to church this morning why because there's a part of me that needs it so paul begins to break this down and he comes to the very end and 24 he says oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me i thank god through christ jesus that he says so i thank god through jesus christ our lord so you could say brother matt maybe that would be a it would be hard to understand romans 7. well maybe it would be for us and i'm so glad that we have a a word prophet who we don't have to guess or wonder or ask what did romans 7 mean but we actually have an answer let's look at this here in romans 7. now this what you see is in bold because this was the person's question they quoted romans 7 14-18 the passage we just read and then they asked at the very end they say quote it here if you'll pick up here uh right here he says now then it is no more i that doeth it but sin that dwell offend me so they quote here's their question to god's prophet romans 7 there's a part of me that wants to do good but i don't find myself doing it there's a nature down on the inward man oh wretched man that i am they said let me brother branham says let me just kind of polish it up so the person asked this question and says this i don't understand brother branham can you explain it to me he said in me is two persons aha in me a believer born of the spirit of god is two people it means two persons right one wants me to do wrong the other wants me to do right and every time i start to do right then the wrong hinders me how many feel they could say i've been hindered many times to do what i know is right notice how many of you people in the interviews isn't incredible he says this how many of you people in the interviews uh this morning let me pick it up here he says how many of you in the interviews this afternoon has run that same thing and this morning so it's incredible people were coming to brother branham private interview and saying this is my struggle brother branham i don't i find that i'm a believer i know i'm born of the spirit of god i know i've received the baptism of the holy ghost but yet i still find a carnal nature down inside of me brother branham says you asked it even in the interviews because there's two people living down inside of you now watch out brother branham says this we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we are a spiritual man soul inside and that's faith in god's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what god said how can i take a cocklebur and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cockle burrow has been transmitted from a cocklebur wheat a cocklebur to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cocklebur and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right see because there has been a life of wheat put in the cuckleberry and the life of the cocklebur has been taken out but the nature notice but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky what is that crocodile right here you've taken remember brother madam in future home when he draws it out on the board and he draws the heart and he draws the snake that's living that first carnal sinful nature that you were born with you didn't ask for it i didn't ask for it but you were born with it i was trying to explain this to a good family member of mine who hadn't seen in many years and parted ways was best friends with him as a little as a boy until 10 11 years old and our lives went two directions my family moved he moved uh we moved away and hadn't heard from didn't even know if he was still alive as a cousin of mine and he then you know this many years later just a week or a week ago after 20 you know 30 years of not seeing him i get an email from our church saying uh you can you please have matthew reach out to me we were good friends i'm his cousin and i began to speak to him and he's he's he's telling me i'm catching up with him about his life and asking him you know we're just catching up haven't talked to him in so many years telling him about my family he's telling me about his and then he just begins to break down and he begins to weep and he says i don't know what's wrong with me um and i knew he wasn't serving the lord i knew he had not went to church his family had sort of drifted away from the house of god he was born in the message raised in a good church and he begins to just cry and he talks about how that he's uh he's beginning to tell me how he's a very uh renowned executive and of great big business he's making a six-figure income he's got the nicest things in life and he's got the nicest cars and he's got boats and atvs and just really he's telling me how made he's got it but yet he says i'm so broke on the inside and he said because i've got it i've got something i can't conquer and it was alcohol uh uh he had became an alcoholic and he was just beginning to confide in me hadn't told anybody said no no one even in his family except for his immediate family but he begins to confide in me and tell me how broken he is and what can he do he can't conquer this and he's tried over and over and he says i'm disciplined in every way of my life i i wake up every morning at five i exercise i have an exercise routine i'm healthy i eat healthy my body's in good shape i'm making good money i have a good life i'm i'm a good person he says but yet there's i can't conquer this it's got a hold of me and i'm like a slave that's what he told me i'm like a slave and it's my master and no matter how what i've tried of i've tried everything i've tried alcoholics anonymous i've tried uh self-help i've went to counselors and he says no matter what i've tried he said and he began to just he couldn't even speak he was crying he said i'm i'm so broke and he said it's going to destroy me i'm going to take someone's life he said in a car accident it's going to cost me my marriage it's going to cost me my my my career and he says i need i need freedom from this and i don't understand why i can't overcome this and i just began to deal with him i said what you've got to understand is that i don't care how polished up you've made your outside i don't care how disciplined and what grit iron will you have to live a good life and how determined and militant you are there's always a part of you that you were born with that is your master and you are its slave and until you're set free from the dominion of sin you could try all your self-help you can try all your iron will you could try your grit and your human ability but you'll come back to the same exact place you are born with the carnal nature and that nature is enmity with the things of god and it will always have a hold of you until you surrender your life to christ until you come and let the lord take out that cocklebur life and replace it with a wheat life oh i'm so glad i can say today that satan is no longer on the throne of my heart but jesus reigns supreme and i may not always do right i may not always make the right choices i may still make mistakes but in my heart i know i've got a desire to live for the lord jesus that's because of something he did not because of something i did brother madam says because there's a conqueror in the life of that congregate has been taken out but notice the nature of the cuckleburg is still sticky and it will be until i'm born again until i come to the altar and i get prayed over enough times until brother branham says and it will be until this new life has fully been developed say brother matt when will this new life fully be developed when you turn 18 for the second time now a believer will know exactly what i'm talking about you might have turned 18 you may not be 18 yet young people but let me tell you you'll be 18 one day and you'll be 18 a second time around 18 19 years old when that new body that's when the new life has been fully developed until then you're in a war he says it's still sticking until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth notice then it's no more cockapoo but wheat but wheat but while it's here on earth out of the earth at a cockleboro it's still sticky but it's got in the nature on the inside of it of wheat now this is how brother branham answers romans 7 as long as you're in this life how many still in this life i know some people live up in the ethereal and they're so high up here and they lose reality that you're still down here with us as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature you know we're sticky that's how we are we're sticky nature back home where there's a lot of humidity and you get real sticky maybe here you get real prickly like the cactus there's always you don't get too close there's a nature of thorns and you know what it'll always be there can you say amen so brother madam says this he says that's going to notice and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up in other words in the resurrection when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ that's why paul said we don't know what we will be when he appears but we know this we shall be like him in his very image you say hal brother matt will i be like him because i'm being changed from glory unto glory from line upon line precept upon precept and one day this body will change as my soul has changed how am i going to get there brother matt how am i going to receive a change of my body do you realize that the same supernatural power that changed you to a christian and to desire the word of god do you know that no amount of effort no amount of knowledge no amount of education can ever put that desire down inside of your heart but a supernatural power has put something inside of you to thirst for the things of god and to hunger for the things of god that's supernatural and the same power that transforms your inside is also what's going to come upon you as quickening power and change the outside so brother branham says here you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ all sin is going from you that's the thing now notice this he says somebody told me now now brother brandon begins to tell this story and he tells about the old indian chief and you remember the story really well and the man comes to the prayer line and billy's only giving out prayer he's he's trying to ask everybody because they only wanted to take enough time to take very serious needs very serious conditions and diseases and the man indian chief can't speak english and he comes up to the line and he and he says uh he says to to bill brother billy paul he says what's wrong with you me sick me sick and brother madam says all he could say to billy was me sick and and brother billy paul finally puts him through brother brandon prays for him and then you go on from that and brother madam says years later this man becomes converted he's converted he's born of the spirit of god and brother bannon begins to relate the story he said somebody told me he'd one time it was converted received the holy ghost and he said to him how are you getting along and this is the indian chief and he said pretty good and pretty bad now if you'd be honest today and ask you how you're doing that's what your answer would be too how you doing today pretty good and pretty bad he says well how do you mean pretty good and pretty bad he said well since me received the holy ghost he said there's been two dogs in me one of them a black dog and one of them a white dog he said they argue all the time he said they growl and they fight and at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad said well chief he says he says well chief which one of them wins the fight said that depends on which one chief feeds the most which one wins whichever one i feed the most so i think that's a good answer there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature notice this the carnal nature after the things of the world are the spiritual nature after the things of god that does it so in other words what's inside of me there's a nature that i've received by the baptism of the holy ghost and i have a choice every day to feed that seed or to starve that seed you as a believer have a choice every day to feed the carnal nature of the flesh with things of the world and holy wood and entertainment and you can feed that so much to where you wonder if you're even a believer at all but you've got a choice to feed on the word of god and to give that inner man spiritual food in due season you see brother brandon begins to break this down he says that's how you're born you're born in a carnal state and the prophet of god says there's always a part of you he says you're made up of body spirit and soul and he says and inside of that body there's five senses that contact the outside world and then in the spirit there's five senses that contact spiritually brother branham says there's five senses you have your memory you have your conscience you have your reasoning you have your imagination and you have your affection and brother madam says within those five spirits even after you're born of the spirit of god you still have those five senses of the spirit that can lead you astray as the flesh leads you astray it can give you a complex and it could prevent you from hindering it could hinder the word of god in your life if you don't clean out the channels remember brother branham says that's what's wrong with so many blowed up christians so many blown up believers they never clean out the channels memory conscience reasoning imagination affection and brother branham says they never clean it out and he says and they grow he says they they live because you know i've heard it said and this is a powerful thing because brother brandon begins to talk about how that he says do you believe in a guardian angel and brother madam says absolutely the bible teaches that he says when you're when you're born he says there's there's a spirit there to receive that life when it breathes its first breath and the prophet of god said and even as a little baby that angel is guarding over that soul and he's always trying to influence him always trying to woo it to himself always trying to influence that seed that's down inside of him what does he use he uses a mother a godly mother a godly father he uses a preacher a pastor it uses the word of god and he's trying to reach that child he's trying to get that child to surrender brother madam says but just as much he says as there's a angel following you there's also a spirit an evil spirit trying to destroy you remember the prophet said even i would have given my heart to the lord years before i did but there was a spirit that hung over me so there's always an evil spirit trying to call you trying to influence you and there's always a word that's trying to reach you and the word that's trying to influence you and a word that's why you're here today is because you surrendered to the influence of jesus in your life and he led you and wound you and called you unto himself but even after you're born of the spirit of god there is still that struggle down inside of you even after you're born of the spirit of god there's still a s there's still a struggle that you live with can you say amen notice what the the scripture says and let me just let me just find my place i just want to read this to you because i i just believe it would be helpful if we did and so i i want you to notice this here let me just pull it up in my in my notes so we know we know we know this here the bible says all of us everybody all men this is romans 3 9 are sinners say brother matt how did i start with this problem i've got sin i've got a sinful nature a carnal nature this cockleboro sticky nature all inside of me you know we could we could diagnose and we could look at and trace back the where did sin originate how did i end up like this and why do i have this and we could trace it all the way back to the garden of eden and where adam and eve fell and we could trace the origins of the problem you know but when someone has cancer they're not so much concerned on you telling them the scientific definition of cancer and how a sale begin to do this and they're not so much interested in that what they're interested in is how do i become free how can i get delivered of cancer so how do i get delivered of this problem that i was born with that i inherited that i didn't do anything to get but i find this nature down inside of myself now the bible says romans 3 it says in romans no one is good no not one and all the world is innocent it's like jordan peterson i was amazing not our brother here but jordan pierce and the the uh the professor he he just recently was converted to the to the lord through his wife his testimony of his wife you hear it it's pretty powerful and he began to just break down and and it was powerful he made a powerful statement he said really truly the only true christian that has ever lived the only true christian it's christ we're in we we want the life of christ and we walk after as paul said you follow me imitate me as i imitate christ but truly the only true christian was jesus all are sinners notice this here he says all have gone astray no one is good everyone has turned away no one has kept on doing what is right so it paints this picture of what sinful man is what a what the bible says the the heart is deceitful and desperately wicked all of sin all of i know people love to classify sin and they like to make big sin and then little sin and then they put you know this the pornography is somewhere up here and then pride is somewhere down here and then you know uh methane you know a meth addiction or some kind of drug is somewhere in here but then a temper is somewhere down in here we we like to classify sin but do you know in the eyes of god they're all sin i should get a big amen and god's eyes they're all equal all have sinned all have fallen short there is no not one all men alike are sinners or some better than others no all have sinned no one has done right no one has truly followed god the thus from the soul this is idea isaiah from the soul of the feet even to the head there's no soundness about us so sin is the disease that pollutes every part of us our body our spirit our mind our emotions all have sinned the heart is desperately wicked i know some of you maybe came here brother aaron there's a there's an entire if you could clean up those angel wings and all those halos that we just took off and ripped and threw them in the corner there what you realize is that we're all equal at the foot of the cross it's not big i and there's not a little you there's not one better not a preacher that's higher than a person sitting in the audience we're all equal and brother brandon begins to say this here and he says because that spirit that's down inside of you notice he says you're made up of body soul and and spirit and he says and inside of there he says you can you can get a complex he says even something inside of your spirit that hinders you and you watch how people are made and you've heard this statement before and i know it's very popular but it's it's a profound statement and and it's the hurt the statement says hurt people hurt people hurt people hurt people right and so you take a person who's born of a of a good family and a good home and maybe they're raised a certain way and then and then they they marry they take that person and their their their bread with all of the all of the the the brother brandon calls it the grab bag of life that's what he that's how he labels it the grab bag of life just you were born with with all of your whether they were good things or bad things i heard a man say one time your adult life is simply a reaction to your childhood your whole adult life is just a reaction of how you were as a child those good things that happened to you or those bad things that happened to you for all of us both things that we should have gotten that we didn't are the things that we didn't get that we should have whether that was love or emotion or or affection or or provision or whatever it is you're made up of all of those remember brother brandon begins to tell about the boy and it's it's even his nephew and he begins to say how this mother and this father i know that i've read this here before and he says that mother and that father came to me and he says and they said brother branham uh we don't know what to do with him he was d was dating a girl and getting serious with her about to engage her but he had this issue and the prophet doesn't say what the issue is but he said he had this this issue and and brother branham they come to him in counsel and they say our son has this problem and and we need we need help we know he's a good boy that's what they tell him we know he's a good boy but he has this hang up in this issue and he's starting to like this girl and they're starting to get serious and brother adam says now he says i started to look at them and he says and i he says i i looked at the mother and he says now look at you mom look at you and he says look at your family they're germans he said they're all germans you come from a german family german home he said they're very stoic they're very serious he says and in your family there's a strain in that family where they can't ask for forgiveness they can't it's just not in them to do it so they can't ask and say i'm sorry he says just not in them to do it brother branham says they're so just serious people it says even look at your sister he says you know just you know how she is he said she won't even hardly look at you he says her sister was the same exact way he said i i walked down the street and there she was in her yard and he looked at her and he said good morning and brother brandon says she just sat and stared at me sure fine morning brother brandon says you just stared at me look look me right in the face some of how some of you are doing to me today he said she just stared at me didn't say anything he says you should come down to the house and see us sometimes brother adam says she just sat there and stared very stoic german you know very exact very precise and brethren says now that's how your your family was he said you were bred with that that came into you but your dna and then that was passed on down to that boy and he says now look at you dad he says look at your family now brother brandon doesn't tell this on tape but this is actually brother billy paul this is only his this is brother brandon's own family my might be his cousin or his brother he says look at your family what are they they're all they're irish she says they're all fighters all of them are brawlers just he said just at that just in a moment they'll get into a fight real high strung and he says look at you he said all of them are fighters and all of them are brawlers and then he stops he says no but look at you mom you're not the way your family is they're all stoic can't ask for forgiveness he says we'll just stare at you and look at you and he says but you're not that way and he looks at the dead he says now look at you your family are all fighters and brawlers and they're all he says they they they always you know uh he says always just fighting and he says but you're not that way he says now what did that to you mom he says what did that to you dad you found the lord jesus in your life and he says and you're not the way you used to be brother branham says see when you come and become a new creature in christ i love how the prophet says it this way he says it's no more your people it's no longer your people it's your jesus living down inside of you and he says it's changed that nature down inside of you and he says now the same thing that happened to you will have to happen to that boy and the prophet says and until then i'd advise him never to get married he'd make a woman's life miserable so what what is it you're made up of body you're made up of soul made up of spirit listen how brother brandon begins to diagnose this i want you to watch and follow this if you went into a doctor's office and told him you were sick told him your symptoms and he was in a hurry he would probably give you a little prescription with some anesthetic in it of some sort some aspirin the doctor is merely trying to get rid of you just at that time because he hasn't time you know that's a lot how we treat people sometimes we don't have time for them so we just take the gospel you just need to be born again just take it you know i'm so glad that the lord jesus didn't treat me that way he says that doctor would just try to give you the medicine come into a doctor's office just take the medicine here's the prescription just get out of my office he said that doctor is just trying to get rid of you because he hasn't the time he says but a real good doctor before he give you the medicine would diagnose that case thoroughly till he found out what was wrong then give you the medicine if we're not careful that's how we treat people sometimes when when brother branham's preaching this and zacchaeus the businessman and he begins to talk about zacchaeus and how he was critical and and he was just you know he was critical of of the lord and he got up on a high tree and and he because he was a short man brother says a little short man and he couldn't he said he he's but really that that na that that that his stature his height brother branham says was a identification of his need and he says he couldn't see he says he says see zacchaeus was so critical and so skeptical but there was something that made zacchaeus that way maybe it was something down in his life down in the history of his life in a home and and you take a man you take a woman and they're both as brother brandon begins to tell the story and he says then the man's made up of this and the woman's made up of this and all their all their complexes and all their fears and all their issues and their teachers that they were raised under it the father that they had and the mother that they had and the mother that he had and the father that he had the influence of their home the atmosphere at their table the atmosphere of their house the atmosphere at their church that's what you're made up of you're made up of all of those ingredients and then you take two people that are in love with each other but yet they come from two different backgrounds two different families have different homes went to different schools had different teachers you know brother branham said all of those things are so important in your life even in leadership when he preaches about a boy and he says notice you were led from your mother and the very first love you ever had was the mother's love and he said and brother branham says you knew the love of the lord jesus because you related it to a mother's love a true mother's love is like the love of the lord jesus and he says who will love you in spite of anything and care for you no matter what and no and brother madam says you notice you started out there under the leadership of a mother and that mother led you as far as she could led you and brother madam says then there came a dispensation change and you went from the mother to the father and he says now the father is still love you're still learning love through the father prophet said it may be more corrective love than mother's love maybe it's through discipline as brother diggs preached back at home every parent is like law and grace you have law and then you have grace and brother digg says my mom was a police officer she was law all law and he says you then you go to the father and he says in that father now what is he doing he's training you he's leading you a little further he you come under the influence of that father and that father influences you in a good way or a bad way or probably a mixture of both he has his own hang-ups that he got from his dad and then his dad has his own hang-ups that he got from his dad listen there's none of us that are pure none of us are perfect we all are a mixture of good and bad and evil and righteous and all of us are a big grab bag of all of the things that make up us and brother brandon says then you go from the mother and then you let transfer that to the father and brother madam says then you're under the tutelage of that father and that father's instructing you and teaching you discipline and teaching you what it means to be a man and teach you know what it means to go to work and teaching you what it means to to you know you know take care of a one of a family remember that says then you move and you you go and there's a dispensational change again and you graduate from that mother to that father and now he says maybe you're teachers at school and he says and those teachers who will teach you they lead you a little bit further maybe the sunday school teacher and he says you come and you transition and they teach you and train you then you go from there to your employer then you go from there and he said you're out on your own and all of those things that you're made up of that boy and that girl when they get married he says they're made up of all of the differences and all of the complexes all of the atmospheres the good things that happen the bad things that happen maybe that mother maybe that girl went through a time of sorrow and maybe there was cancer in the family and she lost a loved one and maybe that boy had a dad who was militant and he was always on top of him and always just performed and everything was about performance and then he grew up to estimate his worth based upon how well he performed maybe he had a a mother who was uh didn't care how he lived and never taught him the bible never taught him about the lord jesus and then he grows up maybe had an uncle or a home or at the atmosphere of their church didn't preach the word of god maybe preached a hybrid virgin brother madam says all of those things that make you up then you take all of those differences and then you marry them together and inside of that union and that relationship of all of those things that are made up he says are all of those good all of that bad all of the good atmosphere the bad atmosphere the good experiences the bad experiences and the prophet of god says and if you're not careful if you don't constantly clean out the channels and constantly you say brother matt what and i want to just say this here because i want to make sure i don't get lost it's what the lord really burdened my heart with because i'm preaching to you today on the sermon title is being changed let me give my title that was that's my title being changed and if i can't if i don't want to lose this one thing i want to convey to you this morning when you're born of the spirit of god there's a part of you that is instantly changed from one kingdom of darkness to a kingdom of light you are changed when you're born of the spirit of god when you're born of the spirit of god you're changed there's a part of you that's changed but there's also a part of you that's being changed and you must i hope i could emphasize this and highlight it have it on a neon sign you must of necessity constantly be being changed you cannot stop i don't care how far the lord has brought you in your mind your marriage your spirit your relationship in your church as a believer you can never stop changing and growing and progressing don't ever stop as a believer you must continue to be changed there's got to be a desire from a christian from a believer to say lord you've brought me a mighty long way but i've got a long way to go and i want you to constantly change me evolve me let me always be cleaning out my mind let me be cleaning out my spirit always be moving on experience with the lord is not a one-off time one time you met the lord but it's a daily walk it's a daily relationship it's a daily battle that you're constantly in and you've got to keep moving on don't ever stop being changed i said brother how how's my body going to change let me just say this the body change will just be the final change that god brings in your life but until then you're cleaning out you're moving out you say i've tasted of the lord but i need more i've been filled with the spirit but i've got to be constantly being refilled you know you ought to wake up every day and say lord refill me one more time with your spirit refill me one more time lord clean out my memory my conscience my imagination my affection listen to what brother branham says here sometimes we find people going for the prayer lines across the nations and they just run up and think the lord ought to heal them right then but there's something maybe down in there and we set before the lord until he reveals it until he reveals that what it is then there's there's something now notice i got it in capital here and i want you to remember this there's a reason for everything there's a reason for everything and you've got to find the reason and then you can find what to work on i find someone now listen what brother adam says now excuse me on the interviews this morning i guess they're still here in the building that about speaking with tongues now brother brandon preaches that this is in questions and answers and he preaches that morning against what the pentecostal church is preaching that the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost is to speak it next now i want to just say this and i know i've said this here before brother branham was not against at all whatsoever in fact he was the polar opposite of what you could say brother adam was not against speaking in tongues in fact he was the direct opposite of that but brother adam was against preaching that the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost is that you speak with tongues brother paul says the bible clearly says not all speak with tongues so that's not what we're preaching on this morning i want you to notice brother brandon preaches this entire message and he says i just preached how the evidence of the holy ghost is not speaking in tongues and he says now he says the person is a genuine person a real person and they've lived right and they've heard me say the evidence of the holy ghost wasn't speaking in tongues and it isn't but i advise that person to ask god to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy now you just took the entire sermon to tell us how that speaking in tongues was not the evidence but now you've counseled with this sister and you counseled her and told her you should ask the lord to let you speak in tongues or prophesy why because it's the nature because it's the nature the nature of what the nature of this person brother bradham discerned and knew that she would always live in a constant state of unrest until she had a she had an experience of speaking in tongues she would always wrestle within herself because why that's how she was made you may not be made that way but she was listen to what brother madam says the first thing i went to that person and found their birthplace birthplace so you mean my birthplace has something to do with how i'm natured and how i'm made yes brother adam says and what sign they were born remember we were talking about i was talking with my son about this he says and what sign they were born under so brother branham as a prophet sees this person look finds out where she was born finds out what star what sign she was born under you know brother bran and believed in that first first bible was a strong was in the stars that's what brother branham said and he says i found out what sign she was born under and could tell what their birth was notice which way it said in their natural nature sets them in a certain line then when they're born again they're over here in another nature now notice what brother branham says this is with this woman he begins to diagnose this woman and he says there's a nature down inside of her she's born under a certain place she's born under a certain sign and because she's born and made that way i told her you should ask the lord to let you speak in tongues because he knew that would clinch something inside of her say would the lord jesus do that for me brother branham answers the question i love this so much he's he's asked the questions and questions and answers and says brother branham the bible says in the book of james lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover and he says but then over here the roman centurion he comes and just says to the lord speak the word and jesus says no great faith no greater faith if i found in all of jerusalem so brother adam says the person asked the question says i don't understand brother branham i thought that the to the gentile true gentile faith is not to come and have a laying on of hands but just to believe the word of god brother branham says now he says you must understand he says i love this the prophet's simplicity he says so one person needs something this woman needed a physical manifestation some people need that some people need to come out of their seat and come to an altar and have a minister lay their hands on them and pray the prayer of faith the bible says the prayer of faith shall save the sick others by faith can receive it right where they're at not mentally not talking about that but they can receive that same thing down in their spirit brother says but why would god do both because the prophet says because remember god will always meet you at whatever level of faith you can come to he'll never stop oh i'm so glad for that brother aaron he'll never stop and say you know what you don't need something you should just believe my word and you can't accept it you've got to be here brother says he never does that he'll meet you at whatever he'll come down to your level oh how many are here and can say i'm so glad jesus came to my level he met me no matter how low i was he reached down to my level brother man says he'll meet you at whatever level of faith you have he'll never stop on a technicality but he looks at the heart he says he says and then when you find out this nature that's the inside uh in conscience inside conscience now it's been one of the greatest listen to what he says here he says it's been one of the most amazing things i've noticed along the lines of my ministry of our lord jesus is the peculiarity of people how peculiar some people are i know some of you are laughing you go man he's a strange bird yeah we're different one from another and that's how god made us don't try to be me and i won't try to be you and will both be pleasing to the lord remember the brother brother adam says uh let me just move on i'm gonna i'm gonna get to this got too much keep getting stopped and he says uh he says the study of he says now is the peculiarity of people and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study to watch nature of people it's been one of the most amazing things notice and the different parts of the nations of the world where you go you'll notice that there's a difference there's a different attitude that people take towards christ towards the service towards his servants towards worship one of the things has been that one type of meeting in other words to preach a sermon over here would just be wonderful in one part of the country where it won't work in the other part of the country so he says notice this there's it's different because people are different you say then how how should i be brother matt then that's just that's just i'm just an i'm i'm just an american no you're not no you're not you're a citizen from above well that's just how my that's just how i was was raised well that might be fine but what if how you were raised was not pleasing to the lord you say brother matthew whose nature do i subject subject myself to this this nature and the new nature that you receive is the nature of the word and that's why paul says when you're in behold whoever's in christ is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things have become new notice and he says now notice brother begins today i'm going to close here i know we're out of time he begins here to to come to this place i want to make sure i don't skip this he says excuse me sister i have to relax my mind once in a while now we'll be strangers i see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're you're from away from here you've come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart and you've got heart trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of blackness i see a black sheep keep following you like that now brother adams this is a prayer line you can go watch this in 20th century prophet and watch it on video and he's beginning to tell the sister now here she's a believer she's born of the spirit of god she's got the baptism of the holy ghost but the prophet through a prophetic gift begins to discern and he says there's a blackness there's something there's a sheet there's something over you like a dark a dart a dark cloud and he says and brother branham says oh he says he says you've got a lot of trouble now notice you've got a lot of trouble on your heart and you've got hard trouble is that right there's a whole lot of blackness i see a black sheet keep following you like that oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you and that was a man professing divine healing you could hear the sister on the tape begin to cry and say that's that's right that's right brother branham he said you was a witch yes is that true and you've got a whole stir in your church or something another about it is that right you're pastor sick right now he's got polio is that right yes sir sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they're a lion and the only things wrong with your heart is that your nervous conditions got your heart worked up so this woman literally has an outward heart problem because of an inward disease that's not her heart she's born of the spirit of god but there's something that she's ingested in her spirit and it's affected her outside brother adam says now it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you and he says that man's professing to be divine healing he says they're a lion he says the only thing's wrong with you he's got your condition your heart god worked up go home in peace and god bless you you're all right god bless you you're not a witch do you see what happened you say brother matt what happened to that woman the light of the word exposed the devil in her spirit and she was free just like that say then what does it take brother now how can i become free let the light of the word of god shine down on your spirit move down into any complex any bitterness any jealousy any issues any grab bag of life that you've received let the word shine down on you and say lord shine on me shine in every part and fabric of my being expose any lie of the devil how many want that here today say lord i want you to expose any lie of the devil inside of my heart that's preventing me from coming to the image of your word notice how brother adam says this you believe with all your heart believe god will heal you of that tb believe he'll make you well if i ask him lord jesus i pray you'll heal the woman she may get completely whole this is what he prays for her go on your word rejoicing and his brother adam begins to tell this story here then strangely i went to a place or made an odd turn now this is the message he cares do you care instead of turning around i went to make a turn the lights flashed on a lovely couple on the outside two fine young ladies that i just married the two fine young ministers and satan after he'd seen the minister one of them his ministry being set took a life's companion right here at this altar they went away happily on their honeymoon and the enemy jumped on this young man brother branham marries them he's a minister marries a woman they go off on their honeymoon and then the enemy jumps on this man and brother branham says and i'm saying this to express what i'm saying does he care somehow with faith that would not take no they turned and returned back here knowing after they was all the way over way in the east here somewhere on their honeymoon returned back and was sitting waiting i walked in fine handsome young man his wife sitting on the outside crying her their little companion and the other man and the other brother coming running which is a friend of this young man saying oh brother branham such and such has happened we went there and seen this handsome young man sitting there just in the peak of his life a leader of the young of young men sitting there notice and satan bound him you say how did this happen to this fine young man here he marries this woman brother adam just prays over them just marries them and he says and now the enemy jumps on this man and he doesn't give us the details maybe an argument a blow up something happen just that fast and they come back and brother brandon says i looked at the young man here's the woman she's sitting in the car crying looked at this man satan had bound him he never noticed but i took my hand left to shake with his right with his hand right to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting and waiting upon the lord the anointing of the holy spirit was there and that's why it led us see and then seeing the shadow of darkness over him i never said what i was doing but in less than a couple of moments time it was all gone the coldness of his hands left he was shouting and praising god notice these words a few minutes to find himself and here they sit right here this morning sitting in the audience see i love this see how satan was trying to upset that young man by referring to him of some complex to be built back so it's something he had previously a complex that he had previously that the lord had taken away from him and now satan jumped on him trying to build that complex back she said brother matt why is that important because now you take a son of god a minister of the gospel and yet he has something in his spirit something that you don't see by looking at him something that you don't sense but god's prophet begins to take him into an interview and begins to discern his life and there's something in his past that was now affecting his presence something that he had never let given maybe something to that he had never fully given to the lord remember what brother branham says there's a reason for everything he says you notice so many blown up christians like a boiler that's that's the example that he gives he says like a boiler down a lot he says is building up pressure and building up pressure and building up pressure he says but if the flu if the flu of the exhaust is never cleaned out and the flu begins to get clogged he says eventually if you don't clean out that flu that boiler would just blow up and you watch so many people after serving the lord for so many years and they never clean out the channels and then suddenly boom there's a big blow up you say brother matt what are some of those things that clog up the channels unforgiveness grudges bitterness complexes jealousies envies maybe something that that happens between a man and a woman a father and a son a mother and a daughter and then you watch how little things the satan will take any kind of little thing and he'll put something and twist it and pervert it in your mind and then you start to believe that lie and then that lie after a while uh-huh okay you see brother branham says and he noticed this he says notice what happens to you when you're born of the spirit of god and he talks about that old indian chief that had that na that white dog and he says that black dog and says which one wins chief which one ever whichever one i feed the most you see you can feed a lie from the devil you can feed a complex from the devil or you could choose to say deliver me of that it's a no it's a lie in the first place and brother branham says notice here he says he never cleaned out that channel that flew he says what what happens he says what what happens to that man and he says maybe a lie maybe a complex maybe a grudge maybe unforgiveness maybe bitterness and he says then it suddenly like a cancer takes root inside of that man remember there's a reason for everything right and brother brandon says he never cleans out that channel and then maybe something happens in that relationship between that woman and that man and then something so small and then he begins to believe that and then that tense his vision and now he sees everything through yellow colored or whatever color of your complex you see everything through those glasses and brother branham says he never cleans out the channels and then eventually he builds up that pressure and builds up that pressure and then boom a bomb goes off and you don't even know where did it even come from it was like the the titanic that that that sinks and it you just had to it just you say how to the sink you see this little iceberg that was just sitting up out of the water but you see that was just the tip of the iceberg underneath what you couldn't see is usually what causes the problem it's not the outward little manifestations you see but usually under every battery a little small to usually you're only seeing the tip of the iceberg are you with me here church and that you don't see that that down inside there there's a complex that's taken a hold of that person or or something down inside that they fed and they begin to feed that and they begin to feed that and brother brandon says it this way he says you notice how he says when you're born of that he says when you're not when you're before you're regenerated before you're converted now just listen close i'm gonna i'm gonna close here in just a few minutes he says before you're converted he says satan lives on the dominion he lives on the throne he lives on the he's the king he's that he's living in the control room and he says he's the man pulling the levers and he says he's the man pushing the buttons and you can you can try to reform him and as i was explaining to my cousin i said you you could do everything you want to try to clean up the outside and he says you can do everything you can to try to clean up the outside but until you deal with that that inside of the inside of the inside of who you really are not who people see on the outside you'll always be a slave and it'll always be your master and brother baron says see what happens when you're born of the spirit of god he says that that he says before you're born of the spirit of god he says then satan sits on the throne of your heart and he's you're under his command and he says but when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost he says now he's removed from the throne room and the spirit of christ now lives inside of the throne and now the spirit of the holy ghost is pushing the buttons thank god and pulling the levers and he says but satan removes he moves from a place of dominion and he moves to a place of influence and now he's not in control per se but he's still in that spot trying to influence you trying to whisper to you trying to lie to you and he'll tell you every kind of a lie and build any kind of a complex and build any kind of jealousy in any kind of malice he's not in control but he's been removed and he's now he's in a point of influence and whichever one you feed the most will be the one that wins and and the prophet of god says he says now he takes take a man like legion and he starts with just one spirit brother branham says it was could have been a temper and he says that he never brought under subjection to the word of god he's born again of the spirit of god he's a new creature in christ the holy ghost you say brother matt what are you coming to coming down to the crux of my sermon the holy ghost changes every part of you except one because you've only received the down payment you've only received the earnest you still as brother branham said you still have this nature this sticky nature and that nature has the ability to lead you astray to give you the wrong directions and you end up in a dead-end street say but i'm bored of the spirit of god i've got the holy spirit to guide me not if you don't feed that spirit not if you don't if you lean to your own understanding born of the spirit of god that holy spirit has changed every part of you but it hasn't changed notice every part of you one day it'll change every part of you the what is the fullness of adoption the fullness of adoption is a change of my body when brother branham says that cockle burrow is no more cockle barrel now the outside cockroach turns into wheat life what's living on this inside of you right now zoe life wheat life real true life real true life what's living on the outside a sticky carnal nature so what do i have to do what is the struggle to bring this old carnal nature subject to the inner word of god that lives on the inside of me to feed that nature down inside of me to starve out this nature and brother madam says now that complex can start and legion started maybe with just his temper and i was a family man had a wife had children but he began brother adam says started with that never brought a subject and then he starts with one now you say well that's just a you know that's just a habit brother man it's just a habit that happened brother branham said habits are spirits don't ever just call it a habit it's a spirit and that man starts with one spirit maybe alcohol i think brother branham actually says that in one place he says it was maybe alcohol but he never got over it never overcame it and you know what one complex will do it just makes a platform and a foundation for another complex and then that builds a foundation for another spirit and then that builds a foundation for another spirit and you give access through one thing in your spirit give access and that's why the apostle paul says be not entangled again with a yoke of bondage as a believer you can be entangled and entrapped again and legion remember what legion means that wasn't his name you ever heard of the man named legion in the bible no you haven't heard of the man named legion because that wasn't the man's name that was the name that was the word for 2 000 spirits could you imagine how does a person end up with 2 000 demons how brother matt one at a time and that one spirit leads to another spirit leads to another spirit leads to another spirit jesus says when a man is unclean spirit is going out of a man it goes into dry places seeking rest and then he comes back and the house is swept and it's clean and it's sanctified and it's in church but the the strongman the lord jesus isn't there guarding the door he's not guarding the door and he says so he brings in seven other spirits with him and jesus says the condition of the man of the first of the last the latter was worse than before he started you see why it's so important not just to be sanctified and to clean up your life and to get the right dress code and get the right hair length and get the right skirt length and make sure everything looks the part listen friends if the real true zoe c gene life has came alive on you the outside will clean up itself but you're such a dangerous spot if all you've done is clean the outside and you've never filled the inside oh i say today lord may you feel me how many can join in and say lord i want you to feel me every part of me my body my soul my spirit dispel any sickness or any disease in my of a complex or bitterness in my heart how many kids stand to their feet and raise their hands and say lord i want that here today stand up and raise your hand wave it to the lord say lord jesus i want you to come and clean out every channel let the flu let the exhaust be clean so that i can live and feed the right spirit within me lord may you did may you destroy every complex every lie every fear everything that would be unlike you lord jesus how many could raise their hand and just close those eyes and bow to the lord and say lord jesus i want you to come right now i want you to clean out every channel in my heart i want to be changed i'm so glad i could say today you changed me when i met you but today lord i'm in a desire for more change i want to see more change in my life lord i i don't never want to settle i don't ever want to settle no matter how far i've gotten i don't ever want to sit still i want to move on i want to move on with the lord jesus [Music] i want to move on with his word grant it to us lord granted to us i'm speaking to people every head bowed ever i closed speaking to people lord just like myself all of us raised different places different underdipped and atmospheres all of us even after our home maybe we were in the perfect home had good godly parents that were raised raised us in the admonition of god and maybe even after we got out of their home maybe we were subjected to the wrong friends their own crowds the wrong things maybe through this life because this life is full of tribulation that's what you said maybe sorrow or something came upon our life lord that that is as your prophet describes even that little wheat as your prophet was looking across that field and he sees all those wheat standing straight up the corn the corn stalk and he says all those corn everything was growing straight straight up in the air all of them just lifting up their hands up to the lord raising their hands praising the lord and he said but i noticed there was one and he says it wasn't straight but it was crooked he said down from the ground it was it was bent over it was crooked it sort of went to the right and then it bent back to the left and and he said then it bit back over and he said he said maybe and i asked why how did that happen he says well maybe somewhere when that little corn was young when it wasn't fully grown when it was just a child he says maybe a stick or a branch or something fell down upon it and he says and it calls that that crook that that little corn to grow up crooked now the miracle is that it lived the miracle is that no matter how crooked his life was no matter how messed up no matter what paths he went down in life no matter what branch fell upon him he didn't ask he didn't ask for that branch to fall from that tree and to to distort his life and to make his life crooked he didn't ask for that he was just a child he couldn't do anything about it he didn't ask for that branch to fall on him brother madam says but i noticed he said it was crooked as it grew but the miracle the miracle is that it still was living you might be here today in your life maybe some branch or some complex or some some sorrow or maybe something you've went through in your life and satan has designed that thing to impact you in such a way to destroy you but i want you just to take a moment and i want you to notice no matter how crooked your life was you could look back at your life and think i've got so much baggage and so much water under the bridge and so many things have happened i've failed the lord so many times brother matt you don't have a clue i've i've went to some of the darkest places i felt him even just this morning or just yesterday you don't know you don't know where where my life is when and but i want you just to notice something here today you're here you're here you've got hands raised to the lord you've got a desire down inside your heart to be more like him the miracle is that through all of the crookedness you still say lord i want to live for you i want you to take my whole life clean out every memory clean out every imagination clean out every affection oh hands up all over the building god sees those hands no matter how crooked the miracle is you're still here you've still got a desire to fight you've still got to fight desire to say i may not be what i want to be i may fail him every day but i'm going to get back up to my feet and i'm going to say i want to live for you jesus i want to press the battle lord i want to be a soldier in the army of god i want to forget those things which are behind i want to be changed and i'm here with hands raised to say change me lord jesus change every part of my fiber that's not like you grant it lord every life every heart lord you see the hands that are up my hands both up before you now my hands lord i'm in need this morning some of these that are here today in great need come and remove all of the branches that have fallen upon our life come and remove every complex every fear come and come and remove it lord you're the only one who can bring healing lord a a a psychologist could come and diagnosis that science can come and diagnose a physical disease but they have no ability within themselves to heal that disease because you alone have the power to heal you alone have the power to open up a heart that's broken and put it all back together may you do it lord as we just surrender to you jesus mender of the broken pieces i pray that you'd come and heal every heart lord may you come lord jesus and may your life that that that true light that brings real life may it shine when every part of us this morning we ask in jesus christ's name [Music] amen make [Music] jesus make me more like you and give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like you could you raise your hands and sing it now make me more o make me more like thee [Music] jesus may me more like thee and give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee one more time oh make me more likely jesus may be more likely and give me a heart that's filled with love yes lord made me more likely [Music] i wonder if we could sing that song heal me o lord and i will be healed save me and i will be saved heal me o lord and i will be [Music] and i will be saved

praise when you go to the doctor brother branham said if you go to the doctor listen to what the doctor says don't just don't go waste your time and the doctors make some recommendations maybe change your diet maybe do a little more exercise maybe get some more rest just some things he's telling you to do and i think dr jesus has spoken to us today he said son daughter patient there are some things that could help you things that would be good for you when i went to the doctor and have some of the effects of the diabetes and the doctor said well you need some changes in your life these are things you need to do and when i do them i feel better and when i don't do them i have the same results that i had before you know and and one thing i would say god jesus said he said by this shall all men know you are my disciples [Music] when you have love one for another love covers a multitude of sins love makes you compassionate to someone else love makes you walk a mile in their shoes like he did for us it was knee that was sitting there getting ready to come out for song service just we usually get together and we pray first back there and then we prepare and i was sitting there and i just began to think of what he went through on calvary love made him do that the willingness to take my place so that i could become like him that same nature i just began to cry back there saying lord you did it for me amen let us love one another let us help one another let us pray for one another let us encourage one another say hey he done it for me he can do it for you pledge that right now to the lord let's do that lord as we walk together as we as we go lord waiting for that final call waiting for that final change lord may we encourage one another may we love one another may we take another by the hand and say come on my brother come on my sister get up let's keep going lord as we've heard lord that there is that that final change that we're looking for but in the meantime we'll press on lord let that be a commitment of every heart here today i pray in jesus christ's name amen appreciate the word of the lord appreciate what dr jesus has spoken to us to say i love you and i cared for you how many would say amen to that today amen amen through the blood through the blood we can come into his presence [Music] we can come into his presence through the blood jesus christ has made the way we can come into his presence through [Music] i was having conversation with brother matthew some time ago sitting in the back and as a father he desired for his children to be filled with the holy ghost he was talking about gideon and get in here what 18 some round i did it was a couple years ago you were 16 17. and i said brother matt i pray god gives gideon the holy ghost because that is what's going to keep him but brother matt he's still going to be a teenager brother matt looked at me and i said yeah just because he gets a holy ghost he still has to be a teenager and go that's a process that we all go through in growing that's a process that we're going some of you that already got there have a little bit of compassion that's some of us that are still grown but when god gets a hold of somebody's life there is that evidence that change oh that cornstalk may be bent a little bit a bit like this but guess what it's still corn nature hasn't changed god bless you as we come back this evening come believing god would minister more to us amen amen fill my cup lord as you were playing it earlier o fill my cup blow i lift it up come and quench this thirsting of my soul bread of heaven fade me till i wanna here's my cup fill it up and make me hold just one more time oh phil [Music] come and quench this thirsting of my soul bread of heaven [Music] fill it up and make me whole now make this confession to him as you go but until then my heart will go on singing [Music] [Music] with joy i'll carry on [Music] until the day my eyes behold that sin [Music] until the day god calls the first verse my heart can sing when i pause to remember [Music] is [Music] trail that's winding always upwards this trouble this trouble world this is the one you live with my final home god bless you but until then my heart will go unseen until then with joy i'll carry on until the day my eyes behold that city god calls me all the things of earth [Music] they'll lose their value if we recall all the things over [Music] the heart to tremble [Music] remember there will only bring a smile [Music] but until then my heart will go [Music] until the day my eyes behold that city until god calls me home yes until then foreign [Music] you
