to believe by faith take his promise and receive it so and I'm going to I'm going to read the request that brother Tim Cruz had put in last week and then we'll get the second part today also so if you remember brother Tim Cruz says my friend Daniel Walker's mom had a stroke in church this morning and uh she's in the hospital and she wasn't responsive praying for a touch from the Lord she's a Christian and she loves the Lord and it's it's it's good to be a Christian it's good to love the Lord but you know if you can believe all things are possible and our sister Amelia says I had uh some lab work done yesterday please pray that everything comes out okay so sister Martha Peterson says please continue to remember my dad in prayer last week he was taken to the Y because of internal bleeding he ended up getting a colonoscopy a showed a mass in his colon as well as assist on his pancreas that one has grown they took a biopsy of the mass on the colon but he does not have the results back dad is fairly positive and is doing well but is still experienced bleeding though they think that's coming from somewhere besides his colon pray that the Lord work his healing touch that

daughter Sarah went in for surgery because of the broken catheter and all the problems they were going and so you heard brother Daniel if you listen to that and I made to told them I said I I was sitting there at the at my desk and I'm thinking if I could just take her place and then later I thought Lord maybe I couldn't even bear it and she could and it just I was talking to my wife and she was by Sarah and Sarah was coming out of the anesthesia and all and she was moaning and groing and just didn't sound good at all and today I talked to her and didn't sound like the same Sarah of

God bless you it's h it's welcome it's good to have you and then uh brother Joel sister Priscilla and family God bless you welcome I think that's uh all the visitors you got everybody um I want to make a a couple announcements before we get started first uh next week next weekend next Saturday we will be traveling to a group is going to be traveling to Los cruus to deliver some of the um material that we got together a couple weeks ago and that material obviously it's brother brandom's material books and um bound books and stapled books those are going to be we're going to put those in with the brothers in Los cruus and they will be taking them to the country of Uganda it's a great need there not thousands of people and uh really not even tens of thousands of people but hundreds of thousands of people in the country of Uganda have given their hearts to the Lord and been baptized so I'm glad that the Tucson Tabernacle can pay play a little part in sending some material over there so we'll be going over next sat Saturday and coming home Sunday afternoon next Saturday if you are going to be here brother Ryan long will be ministering on Sunday morning and then brother Aaron if the Lord's willing Sunday evening um and uh looking forward I really love um brother Caleb Perez and and all that he does so if you're able to go let's go um brother Dan numer um brother Max um brother Jordan are going to be driving and uh so if if you want to get a spot on there especially if you're a young person talk to one of us in getting a spot to go over to New Mexico I think it'll be a really really nice time I always want to support brother Caleb he's been a great supporter of us here he's a good friend of mine somebody that I can always confide in so I would like to show him how much we love him from here in Tucson I really appreciated the uh the prayer request quests um Sister Sarah brother Aaron's daughter she's anyone that knows Sister Sarah she's a she's a miracle she should have been gone a long time ago but the Lord had something for her here and I'll tell you what she's a lot of fun and always has a big smile on her face and and uh she's just she's a joy to be around she's become a very very close friend with my wife um so really happy to hear that sister Sarah's doing better and then um brother Tim mentioned a lady that had a stroke and brother Tim if I'm right if I remember right she had a stroke in church am I am I right yeah last week and uh she or two weeks ago and uh that's probably where I'd want to have a stroke is in church and uh she went home and the Lord's taken care of her and and I just asked brother Tim um I went back there and I I said uh where does this sister go to church and um he said she's in sista she doesn't go to a message church and I thought you know she's still a child of God and I've I've heard so many people I've made this mistake my wife has made this mistake with with people that we've talked to that we've witnessed to that we've fellowshipped with to to call someone that maybe believes like us Believers and then someone like this sister that brother Tim knows not to call her a Believer brothers and sisters that's wrong you cannot pull that out of brother bram's message now we can we can teach that Doctrine in our churches and we can we can promote it and say oh well we're Believers we believe the end time message and all of this but you are speaking something that brother brandom didn't speak you can't you can't find it in his message he said that there are three kinds of Believers in every church and he mentions Baptists and Catholics and all the different churches so we either need to change his message or we need to just make something up that isn't right right so there are believers brothers and sisters everywhere if they believe on Jesus Christ then they are believers they may not have be as blessed as we are in certain things but then we might not be as blessed as they are in certain things I've heard tell you what I've I've received a lot of criticism there's an old saying brother ly it says that that's not a hill I'm willing to die on you know it's basically if I'm going to get into an argument I may be right but I don't want to argue about that one because that's it's just not that important that is a hill I'm willing to die on Jesus died on that same Hill it was called gotha he died for the Sinners and I just appreciate so much the church coming together and praying for people outside and sincerely praying and also praying for people within our church and then and seeing the results I'm going to talk about a man today named Gideon that made a statement he says if God is with me he says then where are all the Miracles and we can make up Miracles and we can we can say that that certain things because the Lord healed healed me of of a sickness or something we can make something up God is good God heals he heals The Atheist he heals the Christian he heals because he's a good God but sometimes we have to just say Lord if you're with us then where is your Holy Spirit where is the outpouring where are the gifts where are these great Miracles one time I was praying that I was in my closet and I was I was asking the Lord I said 'lord if you're with us then where is the god that parted the Red Sea where are these great Miracles Lord if you're actually here if you're with us then how come I don't see that and I got up out of the my closet and I walked out and I thought ah feel bad for saying that when I was praying I thought Lord maybe I got enthused I I just I didn't Lord forgive me if I grieved your spirit I loved you I love your word I love everything about you I said Lord I'm really sorry and I just had this horrible feeling of guilt and I I said Lord this book just I love it so much would you just give me a little bit just of encouragement and I open my bible and I didn't expect to say this to the Book of Jeremiah I don't know exactly where it is but it said God speaking to his prophet he said why have they not said where is the god that has done all these things my right when I opened my Bible it went my eyes went right there so I thought Lord thank you we should be asking that we should be asking Lord if you're with our church why are there there not more converts do people really sister Shirley do they want to be like me when I'm out and and working as I was ministering on on Sunday when I'm out in my job or when I'm out at the store wherever I am when somebody meets me do they want to be like me do they admire me my Christianity or do I not represent the Lord Jesus in that type of way and that's what many times is lacking I think in our in our fellowships and our churches and it shows that I believe that we have a long way to go and if we have lost the burden for the Lost then our Christianity is very much flawed we have become so much part so much lifting up ourselves and how great we are and how special we are and in lifting up ourselves I think we've done exactly what brother brandom came to tear down which is no you're not special no you're not better than anyone else the only reason that you are special is if you know Jesus Christ that's the only reason the disciples were special and I I do love I really enjoy seeing the the messages go back and forth and seeing the love that really is in our church and it's really starting to form and you'll notice when the people when they come in and then when they're leaving especially did you notice on Sunday just that sweet Spirit of love it was it was the nicest thing people just greeting each other and staying and and worshiping and and just just loving each other that is how we know that God's with us as if we have that love know you could have I know you don't but you could have a great preacher but if he doesn't have love then it it's not going to do any good he can come in and open up the Bible and and explain all of these things but if that love if that Spirit isn't there then it's not going to do any good it's just going to educate you but when we genuine love each other we can lay our hands on one another and we can enter into that suffering like for your daughter like you said brother Aaron I wish it was me that could take that that's love and that's what produces something is if we can love someone as much as Jesus did when he looked on the Rich Young Ruler and he loved him he loved him so much that he told them this is your problem get rid of it and if we can do that if we can really love one another it's greater than all the doctrines it's greater than everything that we could ever have and I look in this This Book of Judges that we've been going through and I see that they did exactly what God told them not to do they just kept going back and failing it was this vicious cycle of they would fall into the world and into idolatry and into sin and then their lives would get hard and oppressing Nation would invade and start taking all of their food and and they they would they would they would get their crops together and they would hide them and here would come the invading armies and take their food and then how do you feed your family for the rest of the year because they take the storehouses and they would they would Rob everything and then of they would cry out to the Lord because the hardship came and then the Lord in his sweetness and kindness and love he would look back down on them and he would send them a deliver deliver her he'd send them help and then they'd serve the Lord as long as that person was there they would continue to serve the Lord and then when that person would leave they would go right back into their denominations right back into their way their sectarian way of thinking right back into in the Book of Judges into their idolatry into their lying and cheating and fornication sleeping around and not not respecting the sanctity of marriage going right back into sin and then here comes the problems again in the same cycle for hundreds of years just over and over and over and that is the Book of Judges it started bad when God told them through Joshua when you go into this land drive out the inhabitants that are there and they didn't do it it goes through every single tribe and says and this tribe didn't drive them out and that tribe didn't drive them out they didn't go all the way even before I get S started I feel like that's many times what we do we don't go all the way we might get into church we might change our lives around we might stop sinning or drinking or smoking or or um running around and living a promiscuous life we might stop sto doing all of that but then God wants to bring us a little further but we still hold a little bit of the world in and we won't get rid of it and then let God fill us with the Holy Spirit and that is continually what happens we don't go all the way and that's what happened in the Book of Judges when they went across into this promised land they went over Jordan Joshua said drive them all out they didn't do it because it was too hard so then after Joshua passed away after the elders passed away then that next Generation started sinning and started Living like the Canaanites that they were living amongst that they didn't drive out the Canaanites Gods became their gods the Canaanites way of living and with without the sanctity of marriage living like that that's the way the Israelites started to live violence from the Canaanites that's the way the Israelites started to live so after they they're going and then God sends down an oppressor and takes over the country and as I said starts oppressing the people taking their food and then God sent this man named Anno the first judge and he conquered Ed the Invaders and then there was peace in Israel the Jews enjoyed peace for 40 years then annil died and the people again fell into sin and then this King named Egan the king of Moab oppressed the people for 18 years then God heard the Cry of his people and raised up a man left-handed named ahud ahood builds this two-edged knife puts it on his right thigh hides it then he goes to this egund King pulls the knife out stabs the king remember he was a very fat man that's a quote loses his knife inside inside the king he escapes the King dies and with the King dead is the Israelites launch a surprise attack and killed 10,000 soldiers they conquered Moab Moab became subject to Israel and there was peace for 80 years and it lasted until AUD died then shamgar not too much is written about him but he was one of brother bram's favorite people as I said when we started on part one of of the judges brother Brandon mentioned him in 16 different sermons how much he loved this man named shamgar shamgar took this cattle prod and he saw that these all of these Invaders were coming in and and taking his food and taking the food of his countrymen so his children were starving and and all of the the Israelites were starving he takes this cattle prod and he kills 600 of the Invaders great man of God that the spirit Came Upon and then then shamgar leaves and then they fall into sin again and then we have raised up this sister this woman named Deborah and this Warrior named baric now after the the death of ahud the judge they rise on the scene the same thing happens there there they they were oppressed for 20 years before God raised up D Deborah and baric baric commanded the Army and took 10,000 soldiers to battle with this King and his General named cicar Barrett commanded an overwhelming victory over cic's Army but CIS escaped and went on the run and went to this woman who he knew named Jil and Jil as I said before Jael says yeah come on in come into my tent lay down here's a blanket here's some milk relax go to sleep so CIS goes to sleep jail takes a tent Peg stick it sticks it in his Temple slams it down and nails cicora to the ground and then they they go forward and and they continue in peace for another 40 years and then God again they forsake God again and they start worshiping the idols of the Canaanites again the Vicious Cycle continues and now we get to Gideon Gideon is in Judges chapter 6 let's let's read it and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of the midianites the children of Israel made them dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds what I was saying before these these oppressors come in and then drive out the people of Israel and they have to go hide died and it was so when Israel had sown they planted their crops that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the East even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till Thou come unto Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor ass and they for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came up as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord the Bible says that man was made in the image of God we see that these children no matter how much they had sinned no matter how much problems they had caused for themselves and everything that they had done they see that this loving God this loving father was willing to take them back just as any loving mother just as any loving father no matter what our children would ever do we would always be willing to take them back we can live in a we can live in the world we can act like the world worship worldly Idols but when hardships come that's when we cry out to the Lord isn't it strange and then this Book of Judges it's really it is it's the story of mankind God blesses us we disobey God trials and tribulations come because of our sins then God bails us out if you read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation this story repeats itself over and over and over again and we think that there's coming a tribulation for this world and we look at this tribulation and we think this is God's Wrath that's going to come upon the Earth how the six seal is going to break and there's going to be earthquakes and we're going to see a false prophets arise and we're going to see all of these problems because of it of of God's Wrath but maybe it's God's love that he spreads across the Earth because we won't serve him or many won't serve him in the good times so he sends these hard times as a as an act of love he knows just as Jesus had talked to the Rich Young Ruler he knew that hey you might be poor on Earth for the rest of your life but you're going to inherit riches in heaven and it's the same with with this if if we could just accept God and make the sacrifices then the Lord will give us what's on the other side and bless us but here these people they sinned and sinned and sinned and then they got in trouble and they cried out to God and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel something probably most people don't know that this is the one time that a prophet is mentioned in the Book of Judges the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage notice the prophet reminds the people of God's goodness and of his power and he reminds them of what God has done in the past and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and I said unto you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice the prophet as all prophets do brings correction to the people and he said you have not obeyed God's voice you have not driven out the Canaanites you have not done exactly what I told you have done exactly what I told you not to do which is marrying among them taking on their way of living worshiping Idols instead of Jehovah and here's what happens so now there's a little pause here in verse 11 says and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in orpa that pertained unto joash the abizer and his son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites now the place that you thresh wheat you you're you're getting the chaff off of the wheat and you do this on top of a hill where the wind is blowing to get rid of all of the stuff and what he was doing is he was threshing this wheat down in the valley down in a hiding place so the enemy wouldn't see him and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him appeared unto Gideon and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us under the hands of the midianites I want to point out right here if you're reading reading in your Bible in your King James Bible that you'll see two different words in that sentence it says here oh my Lord he's talking to the man he doesn't know as an angel yet he says oh my Lord if the Lord be with us do you see how they're spelled differently do you see the small case capital L small case o r d and then you see all caps for l r d the all caps lrd is Yahweh Jehovah it is the self-existing one it is God himself this other Lord is a ruler or a um someone that would have importance so then Gideon the famous saying is Gideon is saying say he says he says sir are you saying that God is with me and it's the question as I said earlier that this is the question that all of us should ask and if you are with us then where are all these Miracles he wasn't just talking Little Miracles he's talking about parting the Red Sea and these great things that had happened and Gideon he was talking with his man he obviously didn't know who he was and then the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and Thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee and he said unto him oh my Lord where was shall I save Israel so you see God's talking through this man you see this is this is important you see how you have the all caps there and the Lord God Yahweh Jehovah said unto him through this Angel and then he says oh my Lord and he's using the small case so he doesn't know who this is oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in manasse and I am the least in my father's house so he's saying Gideon saying hey I'm just this common everyday guy and he's even probably the youngest or the least successful in his family and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man and he said unto him if now I have found Grace in thy sight then show me a sign that thou talkest to me so he's saying if you're a man of God that I think you are then Show Me A Sign Here depart not hence I pray thee until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said I will tar until there come so Gideon's being hospitable here and he's going he's going to go make this man a meal and Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an epha of flour and flesh he put in the basket and he put the broth on a pot and brought it brought it out unto him under the Oak and presented it and the angel of God said unto him take the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them Upon This Rock and pour out the broth put yourself in Gideon's Place what's going on here and he did so then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of his staff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh of the unleavened cakes and there arose up a fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight whoa Gideon did not expect that and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face now the in the Old Testament there's something about about seeing an angel that put fear into the people and most that saw this type of thing thought they were going to die and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die and Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom unto this day it is yet an orpa of the aites and it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto him take thy father's young bulock even the second bulock of seven years old and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath and cut down the Grove that is by it and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bulock and offer a burnt sacrifice with wood of the Grove which Thou shalt cut down and then Gideon took 10 men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day so he did it by night even after all those Miracles he still was a little bit scared of what was going to happen taking his dad's two cows and cutting down his Grove and destroying his idols so he even with 10 men with him this had to be a long night and when the men of the city arose early in the morning Behold The Altar of baale was cast down and the Grove was cut down that was by it and the second bulock was offered upon the altar that was built and they said one to another who hath done this thing and when they inquired and asked they said Gideon the son of joash hath done this thing so some of probably one of those 10 had ratted him out then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son that he may die because he hath cast down the altar of Baal and because he hath cut down the Grove that was by it and then joash said unto all that stood against him will you plead for Baal joash was Gideon's dad Gideon didn't ask his dad took two cows his dad's cows that were probably very expensive sacrifices them cuts down his dad's Grove tear down tears down his dad's idols and I I think not enough is said about this man that's Gideon's dad watch what he says he says and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for Baal Baal is their God that they're worshiping will you save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it is still yet mour if he be a God let him plead for him himself because one hath cast down his altar so if this God is real that we're all worshiping let me see him do something therefore on that day he called him jerub Bal saying let ball baale let baale plead against him because he had thrown down his altar then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the East were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezrael but the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Gideon and he blew a trumpet and and Abazar was gathered after him and he sent Messengers throughout all manasse who also was gathered after him and sent Messengers unto Asher and zebulun and unto Neftali and they came up to meet them and Gideon said unto God if thou wil save Israel by mine hand as thou has said behold I will put a fleece famous story here and we'll read it right out of the Bible behold I will put a fleece of wool in the flower in the floor and if the Dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon the Earth beside then shall I know that thou Wilt save Israel by mine hand as thou Hast said and it was so for he rose up early in the tomorrow and thrust the fleece together and ring the Dew out of the fleece a bowl full of water and Gideon said unto God let not thy anger be hot against me and I will speak but this once let me prove I pray thee but this once with the fleece and let it now be dry upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be due and God did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was due on the ground so Gideon here he's asking for a sign many signs from the Lord he's saying well let let the fleece be wet like the um Lamb's wool or the sheep's wool let it be wet and let the ground be dry and then says okay Lord just so I'm sure let's make it the opposite tomorrow he wanted to be sure I don't think Gideon was necessarily a man of little faith or God wouldn't have chosen him to lead Israel I think that this was something for us to even say now how many of us have said have you I put a fleece before the Lord so just as Gideon had done here so while Gideon lived the Israelites enjoyed 40 more years of peace and when he died they abandoned his family and they returned to worshiping Baal now what happened after Gideon is um it just it went South again and violence started to rise up so Gideon's son he gets all of his brothers together and then kills and Gideon had all kinds of wives and children and his son gets together and gets them all in one place and kills 70 of his brothers so that he could be king over this area that God had given him this Promised Land kills them one brother escapes this man um Gideon son he forms a league around with these with these different countries these different um cities and his brother comes that escapes and he curses Gideon he actually prophesies not Gideon but Gideon's son and he says listen if he cries out and says may the ones that you have made a league with may they hate you and may you hate them and may they destroy each other and they end up doing it and then this man Gideon's son dies so then the next judge toah he was a minor judge which just means the Bible doesn't say much about him he led Israel for 23 years after the death of ailec that's the one that I was just talking about Gideon's son who did all the bad stuff and killed 70 of his Brethren and then after toah was this man named jeepa now jeepa was was the son of an affair between a prostitute and his dad and the rest of his family they were more on a legitimate nature and being born from Jeff Jeff's father Gilead and Gilead's wife so jeffa was born from an affair with her prostitute so he was kind of the outcast and then all of his brothers were they they were just normal so Je to Drew up he grew up with his stigma and really he he was he was a bit of a thug he he was a tough guy but he was a mighty man and then God chooses this man jeepa to again deliver Israel from their enemies he became what we call a judge now a judge isn't sitting on a bench judging the law a judge is a military leader usually or a political leader now it's important to note that before Jeep it was again a period of sinful idolatry in Israel and the Israelites like the Canaanites worshiped Baal ASO and the gods of the Philistines gods of the moabites and Bas basically they worshiped anything but Jehovah this was ingrained in jeepa and you're going to see how we see this a little bit later one of the practices of the Canaanites was Human Sacrifice they'd sacrifice their children they would sacrifice others this was never the case with God except for Christ now Abraham was tested but he didn't kill his son so with that in mind listen to this story judges let's read it from the Bible Judges 11 verse 29 then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon jeepa and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh and passed over mispah of Gilead and from mispah of Gilead he passed over until the children unto the children of Ammon you see that then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon jeepa that's what happened with each of these each of these judges now we look and we think that that Spirit that's obviously the Holy Spirit but this is not the same thing that happened at the day of Pentecost what happened at the day of Pentecost is that same Spirit That Came Upon jeepa that same Spirit Came Upon 120 in the upper room but it dwelled there that same Spirit That Came Upon Samson and all these judges that would come upon them and then leave when it came to the day of Pentecost it came in there and then it took up residence in these people which had never happened this is an anointing that would come upon these and he passed over Gilead and manasse and passed over mispah of Gilead and from mispah of Gilead he passed over until the children of Ammon and Jeep the vowed a vow unto the Lord now watch the influence and said if Thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon shall surely be the Lord's and I will offer it up for a burnt offering now I can't say for sure obviously I know that he didn't think what was going to happen would happen but I also can't think that he thought he may have thought that what was going to come out my front door would have been a goat or would have been my my little dog that I love so much and I would sacrifice that jepa may have thought that but something happened that he never would have thought so jepa passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them and the Lord delivered them into his hands and he smote them from aora even till Thou come to menth even 20 cities and under the pl of The Vineyards and with a very great SL Slaughter thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel and jeepa came came to mispah unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timl and dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou Hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord in k cannot go back so here jeepa he says Lord whatever if if you will give me the victory whatever walks out my door I'm going to sacrifice and it was his daughter so she comes out and I know that there's a debate with theologians and Scholars whether he sacrificed her or not or or if it was a if he was metaphorically speaking or whatever it was but it says right here that he was very very sad so it looks like he actually did do this terrible thing um one okay that's a sad story let's tell a nicer Story one of the one of the things though we have we have this these fighting factions here with with jeepta and the different ones so there was these ones the gileadites and uh there was the the ephraimites and they're they're battling and and everybody looked the same back then they were they were all kind of from the same lineage and the two armies were fighting and the gileadites won and captured this River Crossing that led back to Ephraim so the ephraimites they they would go out and battle or do whatever and they would come back and they had to cross the river here at this Ferry or whatever it was and whenever an ephraimite wanted to cross cross the gileadites would ask if they were an ephraimite now the gileadites controlled the crossing if they said no the gileadites tested them and they said say shth and the ephraimites didn't pronounce it right so it'd be like it'd be like somebody from Georgia where my family's from telling somebody from two on all right if you want to come and you want to cross the swany river or whatever it is say you all and the the the arizonans would say you all no it's y'all so it was like that it was a way of saying things so jeepa LED Israel for six years when he died and he was buried in Gil Gilead now Judges chapter 12 let's go through the rest of the judges quick the these next three judges they're minor judges the Bible says very little about them so let's go ahead and read it judges 12 verse 7 and it says this and jeepa judged Israel six years and then died jeepa the gileadite and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead and after him is iban of Bethlehem judged Israel and he had 30 sons and 30 daughters whom he sent abroad and took in 30 daughters from abroad for his sons and he judged Israel seven years then died iban and was buried at Bethlehem and after him Elon a Zebulon judged Israel and he judged Israel 10 years and Elon the zebul died and was buried in aelon in the country of zebulun and then after him abdon the son of hel the parite panite judged Israel and he had 40 sons and 30 nephews and rode on three score and 10 asts and he judged Israel eight years and abon abdan the son of H the panite died and he was buried in Pon in the land of Ephraim in the Mount of the amalekites so we don't know much about those judges the next judge everybody knows about is the most famous judge which is Samson so let's read a little bit about Samson and then we'll finish up so Samson is the 12th and final judge of Israel Judges 13 and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord couldn't have guessed that over and over again and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of Zora of the family of the D ites whose name was monoa and his wife was Baron and bar not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and bearest not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines and deliver Israel out of the Phil out of the hands of the Philistines he certainly did the Bible says that Samson sought an occasion against the Philistines he married a Philistine girl had problems with her family he ends up burning down all of their crops he gets angry tears down everything that he sees that's that's with that's within these these Philistine people they they come and they hate him and they're trying to kill him he goes out in the field he s he they they attack him he sees the jabone of a mule there a donkey he picks it up kills a thousand Philistines just is raised up to kill Philistines that was his job and he did a very very good job of it he continues on and ends up killing and his death kills 3,000 Philistines you know the story about when Delila his girlfriend worldly girl don't date worldly girls because they'll mess you up but he dated this worldly girl and she ends up finding the secret of his strength and um has his hair cut they gouge out his eyes they bring him to the stadium and he says let me just put my hands on the pillars that hold up the stadium they put his hands there they're all making fun of him and then Samson pushes and the pillars come down the whole stadium comes down upon Samson that and 3,000 Philistines with him we all know the story very famous story about Samson he is the last judge the rest of the judges that that was the last one there's a couple more chapters in the book and it can be summed up with this in Judges chapter 17 verse 6 says in those days there was no king in Israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes there's two stories to close the book the first one really just shows how deeply Israel had fallen into idolatry this man there's this man named Micah he's a fairly rich man he hires this levite priest and uh the musicians can come and we'll close he hires this levite priest priest this levite priest serves Micah and he has this these like this temple with this Idols in it and these these clothes that the priests wear when they when they're worshiping these Idols so then this invading Army of 600 men from the tribe of Dan basically Rob this man Micah and they take his metal God and his religious garments and the the religious tools that he has and then he made they made the levite an offer and the priest basically he saw that there's 600 men or he could stay with this this Micah guy and he says well this is better for me I'll just go I'll go for where the money is and and I'll go with these 600 men they ended up killing a bunch of people burning down a town and it was just it was just sin just full of sin I mean you see this Minister and he's saying that yeah I'll go I'll go with you and we'll take these Idols he was a levite should have known the word of Moses we'll take these idols and I'll I'll bring them and I'll go with you and I'll serve you because it's a bigger church or there's more money or whatever it is just and then just violence and sin and then it goes into the last story that is really the absolute most awful story in the whole book where it it's just a it's a story that's filled with just sexual deviant homosexuality and violence and and death and it just it's a it's sin just pure unadulterated sin and it ends up with Israel having their first Civil War and as before they were even a country even had a functioning government so that's the end of the our Book of Judges on our Bible study our Wednesday night bible study um a tragic book that just shows the nature of humanity and how we always do it and God will send us a prophet in this case send a military leader out of his own kindness his own love bring the people out show Mighty works and then he'll take that servant of the Lord away and the people go right back into where they started it's the story of humanity but one day that cycle is going to stop brothers and sisters Tucson Tabernacle we need to be right when that cycle stops because when it stops there'll be no Redemption anymore there'll be no salvation anymore there will be a time that God will take his his people out it will come a tribulation as I said and then there'll be no more flesh sa and that's the time that we're coming we see the we see the signs we see that God did in fact send a messenger send a prophet to call the people out like Gideon like Samson like all of these ones like this Prophet that came this mysterious man that came to Gideon and preached to him and and told him why have they why have they done this and here we are I don't know what 3,500 years years after this Book of Judges was written 3,000 years whatever it is after this Book of Judges was written and we see the same nature of human beings being a disobedient group of people let's all [Music] stand I need you right now I want all of my life in your keeping I need you my yes Lord I need you my I need to I want all of my life I Brother
