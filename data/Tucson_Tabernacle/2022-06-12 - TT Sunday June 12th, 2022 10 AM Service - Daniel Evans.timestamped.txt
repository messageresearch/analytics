[30:45] head
[30:46] oh
[30:48] praise god
[30:49] he's so good to us
[30:52] let's start in the book of psalms
[30:54] chapter 90.
[30:57] brother matthew i'm sorry i'm going out
[30:59] of order i felt to put this one first
[31:01] this morning
[31:07] by the grace of god he's
[31:10] so good
[31:11] psalm chapter 90 verse 8
[31:15] thou has set our iniquities before thee
[31:19] our secret sins in the light of thy
[31:21] countenance
[31:23] for all our days are passed away in
[31:26] thy wrath we spend our years as a tale
[31:29] that is told
[31:31] the days of our years are three score
[31:34] years and ten
[31:36] and if by reason of strength they be
[31:38] four score years
[31:40] yet it is their strength labor and
[31:42] sorrow
[31:44] for it is soon cut off and we fly away
[31:49] who knoweth the power of thine anger
[31:52] even according to thy fear so is thy
[31:55] wrath
[31:56] especially listen to this
[31:59] so teach us
[32:01] to number our days
[32:04] that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom
[32:08] amen may god add the blessings to the
[32:10] reading of his word
[32:12] you can be seated thank you friends
[32:19] by the grace of god
[32:21] i am
[32:22] here and
[32:24] i always want to thank the lord for all
[32:26] that he's done
[32:27] i was i was in a service one time we
[32:29] were at a minister's meeting um
[32:31] with steve robson uh
[32:33] and some of the some of us other
[32:35] brothers we were in a minister's meeting
[32:37] in south carolina and there was a black
[32:39] brother he was
[32:41] there was a minister's meeting and then
[32:42] after the minister's meeting there was a
[32:44] dedication of a large message church in
[32:47] south carolina and the brother he had
[32:50] more charisma
[32:52] in his little finger than i do in my
[32:53] whole body
[32:55] and he gets up and he he stands before
[32:57] the people and he says he says do you
[32:59] love jesus
[33:01] and they said amen you know and he says
[33:03] he says i mean do you really love jesus
[33:08] amen he says how much do you love jesus
[33:10] and they started praising the lord he
[33:12] says because we're about to take the
[33:13] offering
[33:16] i thought that was so cute it was
[33:19] it was it was such a blessing to
[33:21] have been there and like i said that
[33:22] brother i can't remember his name
[33:25] but he's got a wonderful church in south
[33:27] carolina
[33:29] the lord is so is so good to us
[33:33] i i read that psalm i wanted to talk
[33:36] this morning
[33:38] i wanted to talk a little bit about the
[33:41] biggest mistake i have ever made
[33:45] and
[33:46] some of the brothers might be sharpening
[33:47] their pencil
[33:48] [Laughter]
[33:50] maybe get maybe get a few things on
[33:52] brother daniel evans this morning
[33:55] but um it is it's it's i think the
[33:57] biggest mistake i've ever made in my
[33:59] life and it's a mistake that i've made
[34:00] over and over again
[34:02] it's a mistake that i made as a young
[34:03] man
[34:05] in school it's it's a mistake that i've
[34:07] made as as i've grown up in my career
[34:11] it's a mistake that i've made as a
[34:12] servant of the lord
[34:14] it's a mistake that i've made in in my
[34:18] studies
[34:19] as far as the bible and brother braham's
[34:21] message it's a mistake that has
[34:23] reoccurred with me
[34:25] throughout the years and especially
[34:28] you young people
[34:29] i want to tell you please
[34:32] don't make this mistake and i think you
[34:35] will make the mistake
[34:36] but when you start making this mistake
[34:39] catch yourself
[34:41] and
[34:42] and stop it
[34:44] got them
[34:45] joe you got your family there good
[34:47] looking set of boys there it's good to
[34:49] see you
[34:50] you guys god bless you all it's uh
[34:53] you're welcome here and praise the lord
[34:55] i saw you i saw you there tonight
[34:57] and it's good to see you again
[34:59] and then brother david and sister sharon
[35:01] you know let me tell you you and your
[35:04] family mean the world to me
[35:06] you really do
[35:07] and sister sharon your family and
[35:09] brother vic and and um
[35:11] all that you all have stood for
[35:13] over the years and
[35:15] stand on playing brother brown's message
[35:19] to the people i appreciate you sister
[35:21] sharon and your family
[35:23] i appreciate your kids too
[35:26] god bless you all um
[35:30] the biggest mistake
[35:31] friends
[35:32] that i've made
[35:34] in my life
[35:35] and and i've said this and i said it
[35:38] it's it's from when i was a young man
[35:41] all the way
[35:42] until now
[35:45] it's i didn't give the lord enough time
[35:48] you know i didn't i didn't take
[35:51] i didn't give him enough of me
[35:54] and
[35:55] in
[35:57] our daily walk with lord
[36:01] we see that there's so many distractions
[36:04] especially for you youth now
[36:06] especially for you we never had
[36:09] this i call it the little square idol we
[36:12] never had this when i was a kid
[36:14] i had other things that took my time but
[36:17] now the enemy
[36:18] has has placed this in our hands and i'm
[36:20] not against cell phones i'm not against
[36:22] smart phones i i i think they can be
[36:24] used for the lord and they can be a
[36:26] blessing
[36:27] but uh
[36:28] they can also be a curse
[36:31] brother branham talked about
[36:33] he talked about how
[36:35] the pentecostal people they never go see
[36:37] a movie
[36:39] and and then he said well he said then
[36:41] the devil pulled one over on you and he
[36:43] said he put the movie theater in your
[36:44] home in the form of television
[36:46] and then we see so many message
[36:48] believers now they won't have a
[36:49] television
[36:50] but uh they sure do have this little guy
[36:54] and they spend enough time on it
[36:56] and and i'm not
[36:58] i'm saying that it can be a time waster
[37:00] friend
[37:01] it can gobble up
[37:03] the time that we could be spending doing
[37:05] other things
[37:07] and i'm not just talking about things of
[37:08] the lord i'm not just talking about
[37:10] praying and studying our bibles
[37:14] that's important and listening to tapes
[37:15] that's important but it also takes time
[37:17] of things other things you should be
[37:19] doing
[37:20] just doing your doing your school work
[37:22] doing doing your your work at home
[37:26] fellowshipping do doing things that
[37:28] please the lord
[37:30] and and you know when we say we're
[37:31] serving the lord it's not always
[37:34] visiting the sick it's not always
[37:37] praying
[37:38] when we're serving the lord
[37:39] a lot of times it's doing what we should
[37:41] be doing
[37:43] it's uh
[37:44] cleaning uh cleaning our rooms cleaning
[37:47] cleaning the house uh husbands helping
[37:49] our wives a little bit
[37:50] and some of the things that they do
[37:52] around the home or or finishing
[37:54] finishing our work paying our bills
[37:56] doing those things that's serving the
[37:58] lord too
[38:00] and many times we waste time
[38:03] and we put other things in front of the
[38:05] lord
[38:06] and i want to tell you friends it's the
[38:08] worst mistake that i make
[38:11] is not giving the lord enough time how
[38:13] much did he give me
[38:16] and then i don't give him
[38:18] my all and all right
[38:20] i um
[38:22] i want to give him more he deserves it
[38:24] let's turn to ephesians
[38:26] chapter 5.
[38:35] this is the apostle paul speaking
[38:37] ephesians is a very deep book
[38:40] so many of the ministers quote ephesians
[38:42] quite a bit because there's there's a
[38:44] lot of the ministry in there but there's
[38:46] also a lot in the book of ephesians
[38:49] that uh speaks to all of us
[38:52] ephesians chapter 5 verse 6
[38:54] says this
[38:56] let no man deceive you with vain words
[38:59] for because of these things cometh the
[39:01] wrath of god upon the children of
[39:02] disobedience
[39:04] and we see right here friends that there
[39:05] are deceivers in the world
[39:08] the apostle here is warning us that
[39:10] there's deceivers to come
[39:12] so we should be vigilant we should be
[39:13] ready
[39:14] for these things
[39:17] be be not partakers with them
[39:20] for you are sometimes darkness
[39:23] but now ye are light
[39:27] in the lord walk as children
[39:30] of light
[39:32] imagine how a son of god a son or
[39:34] daughter of god should walk through this
[39:36] world
[39:37] paul's saying here that you're children
[39:39] of the light so walk like children of
[39:41] the light
[39:42] he said do you
[39:44] do we as children of of of the light do
[39:46] we spend all of our time on unproductive
[39:48] things
[39:50] and i understand there's a time for rest
[39:53] and as i understand there's a time for
[39:55] relaxation i understand there's a time
[39:57] for entertainment
[39:59] understand that to relax ourselves
[40:02] and and to completely say we should
[40:04] completely deprive
[40:08] people of this
[40:09] i'm not by any means advocating for it
[40:12] but to say that we should completely
[40:14] take this sometimes it
[40:16] it puts a greater burden
[40:18] on the people than they can bear
[40:20] so we need to be careful and being being
[40:23] too hard on this but we also have to
[40:25] remember that when we are doing these
[40:27] other things and they may be
[40:30] perfectly
[40:33] moral and holy
[40:35] but when we are doing these other things
[40:36] we are taking time away from god
[40:39] so let's we need to watch that we need
[40:42] to be careful for the fruit of the
[40:43] spirit
[40:45] is in all goodness and righteousness and
[40:47] truth
[40:48] proving what is acceptable into the lord
[40:51] and have no fellowship with the
[40:52] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[40:54] reprove them
[40:56] for it is a shame even to speak of those
[40:58] things which are done of them in secret
[41:01] but in all things
[41:03] that are reproved
[41:05] are made manifest
[41:06] by the light
[41:08] for whatsoever doth make manifest is
[41:10] light
[41:12] listen to this
[41:13] wherefore he saith awaken awake thou s
[41:17] that sleepless and arise from the dead
[41:19] and christ shall give thee light
[41:23] see then that you walk circumspectly not
[41:26] as fools but as wise
[41:29] redeeming the time
[41:32] because the days are evil
[41:36] make the most of your time friends
[41:38] because these are evil evil days that
[41:41] we're living in
[41:43] wherefore be not unwise but
[41:45] understanding what the will of the lord
[41:48] is
[41:49] and i said
[41:51] as paul was saying here we are only here
[41:55] on this earth for a short time
[41:58] you know if we look throughout history
[42:00] and if we look for the for let's say
[42:02] let's say that man has been here on the
[42:04] earth about 6 000 years
[42:06] and we live as the bible just said 70 or
[42:09] 80 years
[42:11] that's a short time for the while that
[42:12] we have to get to work
[42:14] it's a short time that we have to do
[42:16] something not just
[42:18] not just to work for others
[42:20] but friends we don't get a second chance
[42:21] at this
[42:23] this is the time
[42:25] that we have to serve the lord this is
[42:27] the time that we have to accept jesus
[42:29] christ as our savior this is the time
[42:31] that we have to place our sins upon him
[42:36] and accept
[42:38] god
[42:39] and then get to work for him we don't
[42:41] have any other time
[42:43] we can waste it doing something else we
[42:45] can waste it on the phone we can waste
[42:46] it in front of the television we can
[42:48] waste it with entertainment we can waste
[42:51] it hunting or fishing or doing those
[42:52] things
[42:54] but there's something to do
[42:57] and if we are going to be raptured
[42:59] friends
[43:01] if we are going to
[43:03] come through
[43:04] on the other side now i know we can't
[43:06] earn our salvation i understand that but
[43:08] jesus said he also said by their fruits
[43:10] you'll know them you'll know them by
[43:12] their works
[43:14] what are my works
[43:16] how am i spending my time
[43:18] if we
[43:20] if we lose track of that
[43:23] then we might
[43:25] consider ourselves and where do we stand
[43:28] in this great economy of god
[43:31] when the saints all rise and we have
[43:33] this great resurrection day
[43:35] am i going to be there
[43:38] you know not just because
[43:39] i've heard of this man william branham
[43:41] and and my family has has has
[43:44] has followed him and i believe every
[43:47] word that he says
[43:48] not just because of that
[43:51] not just because i i do believe this
[43:52] bible when i call myself a christian but
[43:55] is this bible living in me
[43:58] is that message that brother branham
[44:00] preached do i do i believe it do i take
[44:02] it as the truth
[44:04] i believe i do
[44:05] but there's more to do and i fail i'm
[44:08] not living up i feel like i'm not living
[44:10] up to what the bible teaches
[44:13] let's turn to i'm going to go through a
[44:15] couple of scriptures and i'll slow down
[44:17] when i when i get when i get to
[44:21] my
[44:21] testimony here first peter chapter 5
[44:24] verse 8.
[44:27] it says this it says be sober be
[44:29] vigilant
[44:31] because your adversary the devil has a
[44:32] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[44:35] he may desire
[44:37] devour
[44:39] now friends this is a lot
[44:41] bigger deal than oh i like to hear this
[44:43] preacher or that preacher
[44:45] you know this is a lot bigger deal of or
[44:48] than where we choose to go to church
[44:52] this is our own salvation that we're
[44:55] talking about this is a devouring lie
[44:58] and this evil spirit called satan
[45:02] that is looking to each one of us
[45:05] wanting to devour us
[45:09] and is our prayer life
[45:11] are we able to stand up in his face
[45:14] are we able
[45:17] to take this word
[45:20] and apply it in our lives
[45:23] as satan comes in devouring who he may
[45:25] devour are we able to say it is written
[45:28] here
[45:29] and we have spent the time in prayer we
[45:31] have spent the time studying we have
[45:33] spent the time listening
[45:35] are we able to stand against him do we
[45:39] have that same spirit of god to stand
[45:42] against him
[45:44] friends this is this is a serious matter
[45:48] it's something that should be on our
[45:50] minds all the time
[45:52] and let me tell you
[45:53] satan's biggest tactic
[45:56] and where he really wins
[45:59] is he creates apathy
[46:01] he creates something that you know what
[46:04] i don't really care
[46:08] i don't care enough to really
[46:11] dig in and pray sister shirley
[46:15] i'll do it tomorrow
[46:16] you know it'll be well i'll pray tonight
[46:18] i prayed 15 minutes before i went to bed
[46:22] dig in
[46:24] and pray you know i hear i hear people
[46:26] say so much you know it's it's i'm gonna
[46:29] go on a diet and i'm gonna do this and
[46:31] this and this and uh and you know it's
[46:34] really easy to go on a diet just after
[46:36] you eat
[46:38] man i do it every time just about i
[46:39] probably do it three or four times a
[46:40] week
[46:41] you know i go i go on the diet right
[46:43] after i get done eating and boy you know
[46:45] it's i'm gonna do it but then i start
[46:48] getting hungry again
[46:51] and that's that's when i fail
[46:53] and friends it's the same spiritually
[46:57] it's i'm going to do it tomorrow
[46:59] i'm going to i'm going to really dig in
[47:01] i'm going to do this but no do it now
[47:05] now is the time this service right now
[47:07] this is the time to make a change
[47:10] and you you young people you're um
[47:13] you're about to embark
[47:16] on a life on a career
[47:19] you're you're thinking about what you're
[47:20] going to do in the future
[47:23] and so often
[47:25] i've seen so many young people fail
[47:28] i've seen them fail because they always
[47:30] say i'm going to do this
[47:32] you know this is my dream i'm going to
[47:34] do it but then they won't take the time
[47:36] to buckle down
[47:38] and study
[47:39] because nobody really wants to study
[47:42] school as far as school is involved you
[47:44] don't want to
[47:45] but if you want to be a success in life
[47:48] there takes a sacrifice to get to that
[47:51] success
[47:53] there was a at a football coach one time
[47:55] he said
[47:56] he said wherever you're at
[47:59] be there
[48:01] so if if i'm if i'm in this pulpit i
[48:03] want to give it my hundred percent if
[48:05] i'm here if i'm studying in school give
[48:08] it to your 100
[48:09] and you'll be successful
[48:12] and it's the same thing with
[48:13] christianity
[48:14] let's give it a 100
[48:16] let's not let's not wait around let's
[48:18] not say i'll do it tomorrow i'll do what
[48:19] if tomorrow doesn't come
[48:21] when we just i heard the prayer request
[48:24] horrible
[48:25] tragic news that brother jordan read
[48:27] about this young man young lady that
[48:29] passed away
[48:31] it's a and i know i i know that um you
[48:34] see the picture of them they're just
[48:35] beautiful people you can tell they have
[48:37] a nice spirit
[48:39] but what if that happened
[48:42] to certain people in this room right now
[48:44] what if it happened right now would you
[48:46] be ready
[48:47] would you be ready to stand before the
[48:50] righteous judge
[48:54] and say lord
[48:55] i did everything that i could
[48:57] or would you stand before the righteous
[48:59] judge and say i was going to do it
[49:02] yeah
[49:03] but
[49:04] i just never got there
[49:08] ephesians chapter four
[49:11] you know it says uh when we when we take
[49:13] communion we always read the scripture
[49:15] let a man examine himself and that's
[49:17] what we should do we should be doing
[49:19] that every day
[49:23] but joe adams was preaching last week i
[49:25] appreciate some of the things he said he
[49:26] was he talked about
[49:28] some pertinent things
[49:30] um
[49:31] and i wanted to
[49:34] go a little deeper into some of the
[49:36] things that he said
[49:38] ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. this is a
[49:41] famous scripture and we always
[49:43] use the scripture for the ministry and
[49:46] and it's it kind of sometimes i think it
[49:48] kind of justifies
[49:50] having a preacher up there and and that
[49:53] it shouldn't be that way it seems like
[49:54] so often we're we use this many minute
[49:57] this
[49:58] scripture to justify how we feel
[50:01] about things
[50:03] but i want to dig a little deeper and i
[50:05] want to i want to if the lord's willing
[50:08] read what is the purpose
[50:10] of this scripture
[50:15] and he speaking of jesus
[50:18] speaking of jesus gave these things
[50:21] and he gave some apostles
[50:23] and some prophets and some evangelists
[50:26] and some pastors and teachers
[50:28] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[50:31] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[50:32] the body of christ
[50:34] till we all come
[50:37] in the unity of the faith
[50:39] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[50:41] unto a perfect man unto the measure
[50:43] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[50:48] verse 14
[50:51] that we henceforth be no more children
[50:54] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[50:56] every wind of doctrine by the slate of
[50:58] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[51:01] lie in wait to deceive
[51:04] but speaking the truth in love
[51:07] may grow
[51:09] up into him in all things
[51:13] that we may grow up in every way into
[51:15] christ
[51:17] which is the head even christ
[51:20] that is the role friends of the ministry
[51:22] the ministry is not to point you to a
[51:24] man standing in the pulpit
[51:26] because this man will fail
[51:28] and let me tell you i'll fail
[51:31] everybody that stands in this pulpit
[51:33] fails we say things that that maybe we
[51:35] don't mean or we say things that are
[51:37] maybe we made a mistake we're wrong
[51:40] in saying them but you are responsible
[51:43] to be in this word enough to where you
[51:46] know
[51:47] to where and you're so in tune with god
[51:50] when the minister says something's like
[51:51] ah that doesn't sound quite right you
[51:53] don't say you don't have to criticize
[51:55] him
[51:56] but when it says something it's not it's
[51:58] not gonna
[51:59] hurt you you're not gonna suck down
[52:02] something that's just pure
[52:04] nonsense
[52:05] but you have to be in this word i have
[52:08] to be in this word
[52:10] this word and us have to become one
[52:14] it's that important you can't just go to
[52:16] church three times a week
[52:18] that's not what it's about going to
[52:20] church three times a week refreshes us
[52:22] and it gives us a reason to go and to
[52:24] hear the word and to fellowship together
[52:28] but every day
[52:30] paul said i pray always
[52:32] or he instructed us to pray always
[52:35] every step we take we're praying we're
[52:37] with god lord is this right
[52:40] is am i going down the right direction
[52:42] with this everything from our lives from
[52:44] our
[52:45] for you you uh young people who you're
[52:48] going to marry what job that you're
[52:50] going to have
[52:52] all the way
[52:53] to to where when you have kids how are
[52:56] you going to teach them you get
[52:56] homeschooled you're going to put them in
[52:58] public school what are you going to do
[52:59] you're not going to follow the
[53:00] establishment or necessarily what the
[53:03] preacher says you're going to do what
[53:05] god leads you to do
[53:07] and don't don't
[53:09] don't be afraid just make a stand
[53:12] see i stand on this because i believe
[53:14] god
[53:15] sent this to me
[53:19] and uh let me read it again verse 14
[53:22] that we henceforth be no more children
[53:24] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[53:26] every wind of doctrine by the slate of
[53:28] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[53:31] they lay lie in weight to deceive
[53:34] but speaking the truth and love may grow
[53:37] up into him in all things which is the
[53:41] head even
[53:42] christ
[53:45] and friends i don't know
[53:47] you may you may have a better way
[53:50] but i don't know a better way to
[53:53] accomplish that than to spend more time
[53:56] to spend more time with the lord
[54:00] philippians chapter 2
[54:06] verse 12
[54:08] says this
[54:10] wherefore my beloved
[54:14] as ye have always obeyed
[54:17] not as in my presence only
[54:20] but now much more in my absence
[54:24] work out your own salvation with fear
[54:26] and trembling the apostle paul here is
[54:29] writing this to the philippian church
[54:31] and he's saying i was once with you
[54:34] and i taught you these things
[54:36] but now i'm gone
[54:39] be careful study these things listen
[54:42] pray because you have to work your own
[54:44] salvation out with fear and trembling
[54:47] it's not up to me paul is saying to do
[54:50] it
[54:51] it's up to the individual
[54:53] and that individual must have a personal
[54:57] relationship with christ
[55:00] brother ronnie there's nothing better
[55:02] that we can do
[55:04] it's it's everything is to develop that
[55:07] relationship with christ and that is the
[55:09] reason for this pulpit
[55:11] that is the reason for this bible
[55:14] right here
[55:16] is for us to become one with christ
[55:19] it's everything it's everything that we
[55:23] we do
[55:24] and it's the ultimate goal as paul said
[55:26] here not only in my presence but in my
[55:28] absence work out your own salvation
[55:31] through fear and trembling
[55:34] we've uh friends we
[55:36] we've got to be get ready and how do we
[55:38] get ready
[55:39] like i said
[55:42] is time
[55:43] in preparing for service today
[55:46] you had to get ready you didn't come to
[55:48] church in your pajamas i don't think
[55:52] i've seen kids sometimes moms
[55:54] they put them on but but
[55:57] you didn't come to church in your
[55:58] pajamas you probably spent
[56:00] more time getting ready
[56:02] than you did driving here
[56:06] you had you had to make an effort to get
[56:08] ready
[56:09] and and now you're here
[56:12] and there was there
[56:13] was preparation
[56:15] it took to get here
[56:18] this the spirit
[56:20] that we see
[56:22] in the world
[56:23] today of this
[56:25] this not caring like i said apathy
[56:28] it's it's i don't i don't really care
[56:31] you know well i go to church
[56:33] and i believe the message and or i'm
[56:35] catholic or i'm baptist and and yeah and
[56:38] every all of salvation is built on just
[56:41] a few works during the week
[56:44] and it goes perfectly
[56:47] with this laodicean age
[56:50] this layout to see an age we see the
[56:52] different ages and and in each one it
[56:55] says to him that overcomes
[56:58] but there is one age
[57:01] there's one age
[57:02] that says be zealous
[57:05] doesn't say that in any other age
[57:07] but it says
[57:09] be zealous and i bet you can't guess
[57:10] what age that is
[57:12] this laodicean age
[57:15] and when
[57:16] and jesus instructs he says be zealous
[57:19] therefore and repent have zeal for this
[57:22] but you're lukewarm
[57:24] you know and and it makes me sick i
[57:26] would rather you be a hundred percent
[57:28] against it or a hundred percent for it
[57:30] but yeah you know i'll come to church
[57:32] everything's good i'm okay friends that
[57:35] ain't gonna cut it
[57:37] when we get to that day and it doesn't
[57:39] cut it now
[57:40] there is so much work to be done brother
[57:43] joe
[57:44] there's so much to do
[57:46] and yet
[57:48] here's laodicea
[57:50] and laodicea invites this spirit called
[57:53] nicolaitanism
[57:55] where that pastor
[57:57] becomes
[57:59] our
[58:01] mediator
[58:02] or that priest
[58:04] becomes our mediator
[58:07] and we rely so much on that person or
[58:09] our mother
[58:11] or dad
[58:13] that becomes that that becomes our walk
[58:16] with the lord is this this layout this
[58:19] nicolaitan spirit where he conquers the
[58:21] lady and you know what it does it takes
[58:23] out our relationship with christ and it
[58:25] puts the man in the middle
[58:28] and the laziness
[58:30] of the people and wasting time like i
[58:32] said i have done far too much it invites
[58:37] it right in well here's the holy man he
[58:39] can tell you what to do
[58:40] he can make all your decisions for you
[58:43] i think brother joe touched on that last
[58:45] weekend i appreciated what he said
[58:47] we have to be we have to be vigilant
[58:50] there's uh
[58:53] watching my time
[58:56] um
[59:00] the lord jesus
[59:02] he's great
[59:04] he's
[59:05] he's everything
[59:07] he didn't make a mistake not one
[59:10] he uh he walked from the cradle to the
[59:12] grave walk to life perfect before the
[59:15] father
[59:16] and he was our example
[59:20] he uh
[59:22] he prayed
[59:23] for these things
[59:25] this is the virgin born son of god
[59:28] why would he spend so much time in
[59:30] prayer
[59:32] he was that he was everything he was not
[59:34] only the savior but he was god in flesh
[59:38] but he spent
[59:40] time in prayer there's there's one place
[59:43] in in luke chapter 6 that it says that
[59:46] that jesus had he had a conflict with
[59:48] with the um
[59:50] pharisees or sadducees one of the clergy
[59:52] group
[59:53] and then
[59:55] he and then a little while later he goes
[59:56] to prayer and the bible says he prayed
[1:00:00] all night
[1:00:03] as i said this is the virgin-born
[1:00:05] sinless son of god
[1:00:07] he prayed all night he had a decision to
[1:00:10] make
[1:00:12] you know what the decision was
[1:00:14] he had to choose 12 disciples
[1:00:17] after he spent that night in prayer then
[1:00:20] the next day brother curtis joseph's 12.
[1:00:24] and they changed the world
[1:00:26] but my point in saying it is the virgin
[1:00:29] born son of god the sin sinless lamb
[1:00:32] that takes away the sins of the world
[1:00:36] he had to pray
[1:00:38] and he did pray
[1:00:40] and how much more should we how much
[1:00:42] more should we spend how much more time
[1:00:44] should we spend
[1:00:46] but we don't
[1:00:48] and i'm speaking to myself as i said
[1:00:50] this is my mistake
[1:00:52] this is the greatest mistake i've made
[1:00:54] in my life
[1:00:57] we uh
[1:00:59] i wish
[1:01:02] you boys i wish i could go back and be
[1:01:04] your age again
[1:01:06] i really do
[1:01:07] i would do things
[1:01:08] differently and the thing that i would
[1:01:10] do differently as i said i'd spend more
[1:01:12] time
[1:01:15] i'd learn more
[1:01:17] i'd uh
[1:01:18] i'd probably learn an instrument guitar
[1:01:20] or something i would definitely have
[1:01:22] invested in apple and amazon
[1:01:26] it would make things a lot easier
[1:01:28] but
[1:01:29] i would i would change some of the
[1:01:30] things that i've done
[1:01:32] and the main thing is i would do my best
[1:01:34] as a young man
[1:01:36] to give more time to the lord
[1:01:40] there's a man
[1:01:42] that's uh
[1:01:45] i think uh
[1:01:46] that did this
[1:01:47] in the bible
[1:01:49] there's a man that struggled with the
[1:01:51] same things we struggle with
[1:01:53] he was he was a man that gave his life
[1:01:56] to the lord
[1:01:58] and he was he was a great example
[1:02:01] to all of us
[1:02:03] and uh
[1:02:04] this man's name
[1:02:06] was elijah
[1:02:08] we've heard a lot about it
[1:02:11] he was a tremendous
[1:02:14] man
[1:02:15] he had
[1:02:17] wonderful character this man elijah
[1:02:21] powerful powerful man of god
[1:02:24] and i'll read at the end of service i'll
[1:02:26] read
[1:02:28] a scripture that says he was no
[1:02:30] different than you and me
[1:02:34] how can this man be so great
[1:02:37] and be like me
[1:02:40] well he
[1:02:41] brother kevin he made the choice
[1:02:44] he um
[1:02:46] i'd say when he was on a diet he didn't
[1:02:48] cheat
[1:02:50] when
[1:02:51] when he was living his life he lived
[1:02:54] what he said
[1:02:56] um
[1:02:57] i want i do want to mention a friend of
[1:02:59] mine you all know brother israel paul
[1:03:02] he uh i was at service i don't know as a
[1:03:05] while ago
[1:03:07] and uh brother poe made this statement
[1:03:10] that stuck with me
[1:03:13] and i thought man that is that is really
[1:03:16] good brother israel said he says why
[1:03:19] don't we if we we tithe we pay 10 of our
[1:03:22] income we should
[1:03:24] he says why don't we tithe 10 of our
[1:03:27] time
[1:03:30] it's not that much
[1:03:32] you know just like 10 of our income's
[1:03:34] not that much but why don't we take 10
[1:03:36] of this time that god gave us every day
[1:03:39] and give it to god yes
[1:03:42] but everything always steps in front
[1:03:45] and uh with this man that i want to
[1:03:49] talk about today
[1:03:52] um
[1:03:54] he still made it he made the sacrifices
[1:03:57] he did it
[1:03:59] i want to read a quote
[1:04:01] for you from brother branham
[1:04:03] this is from trying to do god a service
[1:04:05] without it being the will of god brother
[1:04:06] matt if you could put that up there
[1:04:10] brother branham says this now
[1:04:12] when i'm talking about
[1:04:14] when i'm talking about these things and
[1:04:15] devoting time and and serving the lord
[1:04:17] and serving the people i'm talking about
[1:04:20] what's called works
[1:04:22] works
[1:04:24] are as james i believe as james has said
[1:04:26] works are faith expressed
[1:04:28] works are something that will not get us
[1:04:31] to heaven
[1:04:33] they don't do it it's the unmerited
[1:04:35] grace of jesus christ that gets us to
[1:04:36] heaven but brother branham as always he
[1:04:40] said it perfectly listen to this
[1:04:45] but abraham says this he says he only
[1:04:47] reveals his word
[1:04:49] in the predestinated
[1:04:51] now when i use the word predestinated
[1:04:53] now it's a bad word to use in public
[1:04:55] especially when we have mixed crowds
[1:04:57] between armenians and calvinists
[1:05:00] excuse me
[1:05:01] i've asked you not
[1:05:03] to think i know it all
[1:05:06] i've asked you not to think i know it
[1:05:08] all
[1:05:09] but they're both wrong according to the
[1:05:11] scripture
[1:05:13] grace
[1:05:14] is what god did for me
[1:05:17] works is what i do for him
[1:05:20] isn't that beautiful
[1:05:22] the prophet in in his simplicity in in
[1:05:24] the way that he says things
[1:05:27] he shows us
[1:05:28] that
[1:05:29] we do oh christ
[1:05:32] we can't earn our way to heaven but we
[1:05:34] do owe
[1:05:35] him for what he's done for us
[1:05:39] next next quote is as i was with moses
[1:05:42] so i will be with thee
[1:05:45] says this
[1:05:46] just goes
[1:05:48] to show that time is fleeting
[1:05:51] and it waits on no one
[1:05:54] we must work while it is day for the
[1:05:56] time will come when we cannot work no
[1:05:58] longer
[1:06:00] and i always liked longfellow's psalm of
[1:06:03] life
[1:06:04] with partings leave behind us
[1:06:06] the footprints on the sands of time
[1:06:09] we must
[1:06:10] make
[1:06:11] footprints
[1:06:12] while we can make them each of us
[1:06:15] let's not waste one day but make every
[1:06:19] day count the best that we can for his
[1:06:22] glory
[1:06:24] amen brother branham
[1:06:26] he did that
[1:06:28] he dedicated his life
[1:06:30] to god's people
[1:06:33] this man
[1:06:34] elijah
[1:06:37] that
[1:06:38] he so pleased god
[1:06:41] that god didn't even let him die
[1:06:45] there's coming a group of people
[1:06:47] that are going to please god so much
[1:06:50] that he's not going to let them die
[1:06:51] either
[1:06:53] elijah was our example
[1:06:56] to this group of people
[1:07:00] elijah
[1:07:02] that spirit of elijah was so loved by
[1:07:04] god that that when elijah went up on the
[1:07:07] chariot
[1:07:08] that the
[1:07:09] spirit that same spirit that was on that
[1:07:11] man rested upon his servant a man named
[1:07:14] elisha
[1:07:16] and then we see hundreds of years later
[1:07:19] that god again he loved that spirit so
[1:07:21] much
[1:07:24] that he placed it upon a man named john
[1:07:26] the baptist who introduced the first
[1:07:28] coming of none other than jesus christ
[1:07:32] and then
[1:07:34] god again
[1:07:35] he loved that spirit so much that
[1:07:38] dedication that elijah had that love for
[1:07:41] the lord that willingness to put god
[1:07:43] above everything else that he brought a
[1:07:45] servant in this day
[1:07:49] name william branham
[1:07:51] who's setting the example for us not to
[1:07:53] waste time not to think about the things
[1:07:56] of the world he preached against those
[1:07:58] things but to think on the things of god
[1:08:00] and
[1:08:01] even further he said i am a sign
[1:08:03] as john the baptist was that the second
[1:08:07] coming of christ is at hand
[1:08:09] it's going to be here any minute so get
[1:08:11] ready and ah we heard a tape on
[1:08:14] wednesday night
[1:08:16] there were very few people here but uh i
[1:08:19] believe it was mary's faith was it
[1:08:23] oh mary's belief yeah it was wonderful
[1:08:26] and at the end of the sermon service
[1:08:29] remember that
[1:08:30] he starts going through the prayer line
[1:08:32] and he starts telling the people you are
[1:08:34] this you are this you're this and even i
[1:08:36] thought it was cute he gets this one
[1:08:37] lady and he was saying this he said i'm
[1:08:39] doing this to increase your faith
[1:08:42] he says it's not my faith that heals you
[1:08:44] it's your faith and then he gets to this
[1:08:46] one lady i don't know if you remember it
[1:08:47] he gets this one lady and he says he
[1:08:50] says now i could tell you who you are
[1:08:53] and um
[1:08:54] and he says but but that's not that's he
[1:08:56] said something like it's not needed he
[1:08:58] says do you want me to tell you who you
[1:09:00] are and the lady says you can hear on
[1:09:01] the tape yes i want you to tell you tell
[1:09:03] me who i am
[1:09:06] oh it's great and then he tells her
[1:09:08] and then go and be behold in the name of
[1:09:11] the lord he was it was a great sign
[1:09:14] and let me tell you friends i know that
[1:09:16] uh you know there's a there's a big
[1:09:20] ballyhoo about the infallibility of
[1:09:22] brother branham to everything they say
[1:09:24] was it thus saith lord or not but let me
[1:09:26] tell you one thing
[1:09:28] when he was in that prayer line
[1:09:30] it was never wrong
[1:09:33] never infallible perfect every single
[1:09:37] time
[1:09:38] you talk about prophecy it never failed
[1:09:41] and i think all of us
[1:09:43] many of us know people that were in
[1:09:44] those prayer lines
[1:09:46] and there's still people on this earth
[1:09:47] today that can testify to that
[1:09:50] this man elijah first kings
[1:09:53] chapter 17. i'm going to summarize it
[1:09:56] but i think maybe i'll read that first
[1:09:58] verse
[1:09:59] elijah
[1:10:02] he comes out of nowhere
[1:10:06] we don't know anything about him we
[1:10:08] don't know where he came from
[1:10:10] but it says this and i love this because
[1:10:14] if you want to hear a wonderful message
[1:10:17] there's a message called be certain of
[1:10:19] god
[1:10:20] and brother branham starts that tape
[1:10:23] with these words and nobody i don't
[1:10:25] believe could ever read it like he read
[1:10:27] it but it says this verse 17 i'm sorry
[1:10:30] chapter 17 verse 1.
[1:10:32] and elijah
[1:10:34] the tishbite
[1:10:35] who was of the inhabitants of gilead
[1:10:37] said unto ahab as the lord god of israel
[1:10:40] liveth before whom i stand there shall
[1:10:43] not be do nor rain these years but
[1:10:46] according to my word
[1:10:49] and at that time
[1:10:52] a drought started in israel
[1:10:55] and it didn't rain not even dew came
[1:10:58] down
[1:10:59] friends we're in a bad drought
[1:11:02] in the southwest right now
[1:11:05] but it still rains
[1:11:07] it still snows up in the mountain
[1:11:09] and we see our reservoirs starting to
[1:11:11] fall and it's becoming it's becoming a
[1:11:13] big crisis because we're not getting as
[1:11:15] much rain
[1:11:16] as we should and the snowpack isn't as
[1:11:19] much as it should be
[1:11:21] but imagine if it did not rain at all
[1:11:24] or snow or even dewfall
[1:11:27] for three and a half years
[1:11:29] we would be in a crisis situation and
[1:11:31] we're already getting a crisis situation
[1:11:33] now
[1:11:34] with just a little bit of rain that
[1:11:35] we're getting but imagine if this
[1:11:38] happened and there was no rain to water
[1:11:40] the crops they didn't have diesel pumps
[1:11:42] pumping groundwater 500 feet little
[1:11:44] while they didn't have that
[1:11:46] they had rain
[1:11:48] and they relied on god and it stopped
[1:11:52] by the word of this man elijah
[1:11:55] so the famine starts to set in
[1:12:00] and god is protecting
[1:12:02] his servant elijah he goes and and
[1:12:07] the ravens feed him
[1:12:10] and
[1:12:11] then he's sitting by a brook and he's
[1:12:13] drinking water out of the brook and then
[1:12:15] the brook dries up and god sends him
[1:12:20] into a town
[1:12:21] and he meets a widow lady
[1:12:23] and this little lady
[1:12:26] she's as you know she's gathering two
[1:12:28] sticks and she's gonna make her last
[1:12:31] meal for her herself and her son and
[1:12:33] they must have been right at the point
[1:12:36] of death
[1:12:38] and
[1:12:39] this man
[1:12:41] comes to her and he says
[1:12:43] give me some water
[1:12:45] first
[1:12:46] make me a cake first
[1:12:49] and by the grace of god elijah knew that
[1:12:51] god would bless her
[1:12:54] and she passed the test
[1:12:57] she put the brother over herself
[1:13:01] she passed that test and she she gave
[1:13:04] this man elijah she made him a cake and
[1:13:06] she gave him a drink of water and
[1:13:08] he made the prophecy that this little
[1:13:11] barrel of meal that you had you just
[1:13:13] took your last handful out
[1:13:15] try it again
[1:13:17] put your hand back in there
[1:13:19] and keep putting your hand in there
[1:13:21] until it starts to rain and this this
[1:13:24] this bottle of oil this crucifoil that
[1:13:26] you use to pack it together and to fry
[1:13:29] it up he said pour a little out and now
[1:13:32] pour a little out again it'll never fail
[1:13:35] by the by the grace of god
[1:13:38] and the power of god and the mercy of
[1:13:41] god
[1:13:42] elijah goes and then
[1:13:45] her son
[1:13:47] she was a widow she lost her husband so
[1:13:50] her son dies
[1:13:52] he probably had something like covet
[1:13:55] it says in the bible it says his breath
[1:13:58] had gone from him i assume it was some
[1:14:00] sort of a respiratory disease
[1:14:02] and the young man died
[1:14:04] elijah goes and brings them in to where
[1:14:07] he was staying the hospitality of this
[1:14:09] lady and raises her back up again
[1:14:13] because elijah
[1:14:14] was in the presence of god all the time
[1:14:17] he was trying he was he was spending the
[1:14:20] time he was praying he was studying he
[1:14:22] was doing everything that he knew how to
[1:14:24] do and look at even other people
[1:14:26] benefited from it it wasn't just elijah
[1:14:28] that benefited from it
[1:14:30] many many others benefited from from
[1:14:33] his dedication
[1:14:35] to the lord
[1:14:37] and then
[1:14:39] the lord speaks
[1:14:42] to elijah
[1:14:44] in first kings 18
[1:14:47] he instructs elijah
[1:14:51] to go to the king
[1:14:54] and tell them it's going to rain
[1:14:58] so elijah goes and he goes before the
[1:15:00] king and he gets he gets the meeting
[1:15:03] and he says this he says he says ahab
[1:15:07] he says
[1:15:09] get all of your profits
[1:15:11] get the best that you got take 450 from
[1:15:14] over here take 400 from over here and
[1:15:16] bring them down and we're going to have
[1:15:19] a showdown
[1:15:22] if this one that you worship this this
[1:15:24] god named baal
[1:15:26] and what's strange by the wild is when i
[1:15:28] read this again i thought that these i
[1:15:29] didn't know these were hebrews
[1:15:31] these are hebrews
[1:15:33] these are what we would call today in
[1:15:35] our little in our little group right
[1:15:37] here we might call message believers
[1:15:39] these are people that had gotten off the
[1:15:42] path that had gotten caught up in the
[1:15:44] world a little bit
[1:15:46] and they're worshiping baal
[1:15:49] and
[1:15:51] probably not even knowing it
[1:15:53] probably not even knowing that they were
[1:15:54] idolaters
[1:15:56] and they're
[1:15:57] he gets them together
[1:15:59] and he says let's take two bowls
[1:16:02] and he says you can pick which one you
[1:16:03] want
[1:16:04] they picked this one he takes this one
[1:16:07] and
[1:16:08] they they they sacrifice
[1:16:11] the bull and he says here's here's the
[1:16:13] here's the stipulation he said if baal
[1:16:17] be god
[1:16:19] then let fire come down from heaven and
[1:16:21] consume your sacrifice your burnt
[1:16:23] offering and if god be god if jehovah
[1:16:26] begot then he'll come down and he will
[1:16:29] consume my sacrifice
[1:16:32] i said great
[1:16:33] let's read it
[1:16:37] um
[1:16:41] verse
[1:16:42] first kings 18 verse 26.
[1:16:48] and they took the block which was given
[1:16:50] them and they dressed it
[1:16:52] and they called on the name of baal from
[1:16:53] the morning
[1:16:55] even until noon saying oh baal hear us
[1:16:58] but there was no voice nor any that
[1:17:01] answered and they leaped upon the altar
[1:17:03] which was made
[1:17:04] they they had all this emotion and they
[1:17:06] jumped up and down and they they were
[1:17:08] trying they tried to stir everything up
[1:17:13] and remember they were keeping the
[1:17:14] sacrifice
[1:17:18] and
[1:17:19] i have to ask
[1:17:21] i wonder
[1:17:23] these prophets of baal
[1:17:25] these holy men so-called holy men
[1:17:29] i wonder if baal ever spoke to them
[1:17:33] as i was reading this this morning
[1:17:35] actually
[1:17:36] i thought i wonder
[1:17:38] if
[1:17:39] baal actually if this evil spirit or
[1:17:42] whatever it was actually spoke to these
[1:17:44] so-called prophets or i wonder if they
[1:17:47] just generated these voices in their
[1:17:49] minds
[1:17:51] i wonder if they just drummed it up
[1:17:53] because this is how i think things
[1:17:54] should be
[1:17:57] this is how i think that that we should
[1:17:59] do things this is how i think that god
[1:18:01] should act and thinking they were
[1:18:03] worshiping god they were actually not
[1:18:05] they're actually worshiping satan
[1:18:08] so then
[1:18:12] friends when we get an answer from god
[1:18:15] if we're praying and we think we get an
[1:18:16] answer from god check that answer with
[1:18:18] the word
[1:18:20] because god can because satan can
[1:18:22] deceive and he can make it seem so right
[1:18:25] but check it with the word always and
[1:18:28] continue when you get an answer continue
[1:18:29] to pray about it
[1:18:31] don't just sell i got an answer because
[1:18:33] i had this thought like i believe that
[1:18:35] these men were doing
[1:18:37] and it came to pass
[1:18:39] at noon that elijah mocked them
[1:18:42] and said cry loud for he is for he is a
[1:18:44] god
[1:18:46] either he is talking or he is pursuing
[1:18:48] or he is journeying
[1:18:50] or pear adventure he sleepeth
[1:18:54] and must be awakened god has a sense of
[1:18:56] humor
[1:18:57] he was mocking them he's like hey
[1:19:00] you're yelling um maybe you should yell
[1:19:02] louder
[1:19:04] yeah maybe maybe he's busy if you yell
[1:19:07] louder then maybe he'll hear you
[1:19:10] because elijah stood fast he knew where
[1:19:13] he stood
[1:19:16] and he had prayed
[1:19:19] and i'm sure he had received word from
[1:19:20] the lord
[1:19:24] this is a very
[1:19:26] applicable scripture now especially for
[1:19:28] you young people
[1:19:30] and they cried aloud
[1:19:33] and cut themselves after their manner
[1:19:35] with knives and lancets
[1:19:37] till the blood gushed out upon them and
[1:19:40] we see that spirit beginning to manifest
[1:19:43] itself today
[1:19:46] that they cut themselves
[1:19:48] and and the science would say well well
[1:19:51] they're trying they have anxiety they're
[1:19:53] trying they're trying to
[1:19:55] trying to escape what they're suffering
[1:19:58] from
[1:19:59] but friends
[1:20:01] young people i'm sure you've heard of it
[1:20:04] right
[1:20:04] no boys am i right
[1:20:06] they do it
[1:20:08] people will cut themselves and and it's
[1:20:11] a spirit and that spirit comes all the
[1:20:13] way back
[1:20:14] twenty six hundred years or whatever it
[1:20:16] is and we see it right here in the
[1:20:18] scripture
[1:20:20] cutting themselves the heathen trait
[1:20:22] taking the place of god
[1:20:24] trying to take the place today of jesus
[1:20:26] christ
[1:20:27] if these young people would accept the
[1:20:29] lord if they would have christ in their
[1:20:31] lives
[1:20:33] then they wouldn't go to these things
[1:20:38] and it came to pass when midday was
[1:20:40] passed
[1:20:42] and they prophesied until the time of
[1:20:44] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:20:46] that there is neither voice nor any of
[1:20:49] the answer nor any that regarded
[1:20:52] they failed
[1:20:54] then elijah brings the people together
[1:20:56] he rebuilds the altar
[1:20:58] and he digs this big trench
[1:21:01] around the altar
[1:21:04] and he cuts up the sacrifice and the way
[1:21:05] that it should be cut up and he puts it
[1:21:07] on the ultra for the burnt offering and
[1:21:09] then he says you know what he says
[1:21:11] pour four barrels of water on it
[1:21:14] remember fire's gonna come down from
[1:21:16] heaven let's make sure that you see
[1:21:19] the men go out and they dump the water
[1:21:21] these four barrels of water on there and
[1:21:23] you know what he says do it again
[1:21:26] four more barrels
[1:21:28] i mean the the confidence of this man
[1:21:31] so they pour another four barrels on
[1:21:33] there
[1:21:34] i just says
[1:21:35] four more
[1:21:37] so they poured another four barrels and
[1:21:40] that big trench that elijah
[1:21:42] had dug
[1:21:44] around filled up with water
[1:21:47] it was wet there was no way to get this
[1:21:50] stuff started
[1:21:53] and
[1:21:54] then elijah prayed
[1:21:58] this man had prayed before he'd been on
[1:22:00] his knees before
[1:22:02] he knew how to contact god he had put
[1:22:04] the time in
[1:22:06] he had heard god's voice before
[1:22:09] it came to pass
[1:22:11] verse 36
[1:22:13] and it came to pass at the time of the
[1:22:14] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:22:16] elijah the prophet came near
[1:22:18] and said lord god of abraham isaac and
[1:22:20] of israel
[1:22:21] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:22:23] god in israel and that i am thy servant
[1:22:26] and that i have done all these things at
[1:22:28] thy word
[1:22:30] again
[1:22:32] you've been in the presence of god
[1:22:34] hear me o lord
[1:22:37] hear me
[1:22:38] that this people may know that thou art
[1:22:41] the lord thy god that thou art the lord
[1:22:43] god
[1:22:46] and that thou has turned their heart
[1:22:48] back again
[1:22:51] wow
[1:22:52] there is the spirit of elijah
[1:22:55] let me read it again and the thou hast
[1:22:58] turned their heart back again
[1:23:00] we all know malachi chapter 4
[1:23:03] verse 5
[1:23:05] to turn the heart of the fathers
[1:23:08] to the children
[1:23:09] or the children
[1:23:11] to the fathers brother branham taught us
[1:23:13] turn it back to that of the pentecostal
[1:23:15] fathers and here we have the original
[1:23:18] man elijah
[1:23:21] then the fire of the lord fell and
[1:23:23] consumed the bird's sacrifice
[1:23:25] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:23:27] and licked up the water that was in the
[1:23:28] trench
[1:23:29] and when all the people saw it they fell
[1:23:31] on their faces
[1:23:32] and they said the lord he is the god the
[1:23:36] lord he is the god
[1:23:38] and elijah said unto them
[1:23:40] take the prophets of baal and let let
[1:23:43] not one of them escape and he took them
[1:23:46] and elijah brought them down to the
[1:23:48] brook kishan kaishon and slew them there
[1:23:53] and elijah said on ahab get the up eat
[1:23:56] and drink for there is a sound of
[1:23:58] abundance of rain
[1:24:00] so ahab went up to eat and drink and
[1:24:02] elijah went up to the top of carmel and
[1:24:05] he cast himself down upon the earth and
[1:24:07] put his face between his knees look at
[1:24:10] the reverence of the prophet when he
[1:24:12] comes before the father in prayer
[1:24:15] and said to his servant go up now
[1:24:18] look toward the sea and he went up and
[1:24:19] looked and said there's nothing and he
[1:24:21] said go again seven times god does
[1:24:23] things so strangely
[1:24:25] you know with us it was like why would
[1:24:27] why do you have to go up there seven
[1:24:28] times and look there are no clouds in
[1:24:30] the sky you just said they're gonna rain
[1:24:33] there's nothing up there elijah's like
[1:24:34] go another time go seven times
[1:24:39] and it came to pass
[1:24:41] at the seventh time that he said behold
[1:24:43] there arises a little cloud out of the
[1:24:45] sea like a man's hand
[1:24:47] and he said go up say and they have
[1:24:48] prepare thy chariot and get thee down
[1:24:51] that the rain stopped thee not
[1:24:56] and it came to pass in the meanwhile
[1:24:58] that heaven was black with clouds and
[1:25:00] wind and there was a great rain
[1:25:02] and ahab road and went to jezreel and
[1:25:04] the hand of the lord was on elijah and
[1:25:06] he girded up his loins and it ran before
[1:25:08] ahab to the entrance of jezreel i'm
[1:25:10] going to i'm going to speed up here i'm
[1:25:13] running out of time but
[1:25:14] but
[1:25:16] things
[1:25:17] after all these victories
[1:25:20] things started to get bad
[1:25:22] for elijah and how many times
[1:25:25] has the lord blessed us and we've had a
[1:25:28] great victory and and things are going
[1:25:30] so good and we say lord you're so good
[1:25:32] and then all of a sudden we got a
[1:25:33] problem
[1:25:35] and we cry out to him lord
[1:25:38] what are you gonna do
[1:25:40] i'm in trouble and here is elijah now
[1:25:42] now he's fearing for his life because
[1:25:44] ahab goes and tells his wife jezebel
[1:25:47] jezebel says he did what
[1:25:50] he marked us
[1:25:53] he killed
[1:25:54] our prophets
[1:25:56] and she writes this letter says send
[1:25:58] this to him
[1:26:00] and it says this day won't pass until
[1:26:02] you're dead
[1:26:04] why did you get scared
[1:26:06] what am i going to do the whole
[1:26:08] kingdom's against me
[1:26:10] elijah goes up
[1:26:12] seeking the voice of the lord
[1:26:15] he goes up and he lays under i believe
[1:26:18] this is when he laid under the juniper
[1:26:20] tree
[1:26:21] and an angel came to him
[1:26:25] and as i was reading that again this
[1:26:27] morning
[1:26:28] i was thinking
[1:26:31] that i don't know if elijah knew that
[1:26:32] was an angel or not i don't think it
[1:26:34] matters
[1:26:37] but
[1:26:38] how many times do each of us
[1:26:41] have to have the opportunity to be an
[1:26:43] angel
[1:26:44] to someone else
[1:26:46] brother branham said that god loved his
[1:26:50] prophet and he sent the angel with the
[1:26:51] softest hands
[1:26:53] and how many times do we have that
[1:26:56] opportunity that we can go
[1:26:59] to someone
[1:27:00] and we can be that angel sent from god
[1:27:03] brother joe you do that to me so often
[1:27:04] and i've talked to the brothers you do
[1:27:06] that to other people too
[1:27:08] thank you my friend
[1:27:10] but it's
[1:27:11] it's an opportunity that we have i don't
[1:27:13] want to let it go brother jeremy you do
[1:27:15] too with these encouraging quotes that
[1:27:16] you send me and
[1:27:19] it means something to us
[1:27:21] we should be that angel we shouldn't be
[1:27:23] the one always waiting for the angel to
[1:27:24] come to us
[1:27:26] maybe we should be that angel
[1:27:28] this was a very very hard time for
[1:27:30] elijah and he's under this juniper tree
[1:27:34] he's seeking
[1:27:35] the will of the lord he's seeking the
[1:27:38] mind of the lord
[1:27:41] and how many of us have been in that
[1:27:44] situation brother ed dougal sent me such
[1:27:46] an encouraging
[1:27:48] video
[1:27:49] the other day and i think it's
[1:27:50] appropriate that we play it
[1:27:53] for the for the church it's about eight
[1:27:54] minutes
[1:27:55] and it's about a lawyer
[1:27:58] who was went up to alaska he was he was
[1:28:01] doing he was working he had he
[1:28:04] knew a pastor that was up there this man
[1:28:06] was a christian and he got himself into
[1:28:08] a precarious situation maybe very
[1:28:10] similar to what our friend elijah was
[1:28:13] doing so brother brother matt if you
[1:28:15] could play that
[1:28:28] i hope that i'm not going to be on on
[1:28:29] the spot and tell the story
[1:28:38] this man
[1:28:40] i hope that we can
[1:28:42] play the the video
[1:28:44] because it is inspiring but this man was
[1:28:47] uh
[1:28:48] he uh he like elijah he got caught up in
[1:28:51] a spot where he was gonna die
[1:28:55] and he desperately
[1:28:57] sought
[1:28:59] the voice of the lord
[1:29:01] not knowing what to do
[1:29:03] and here we go
[1:29:19] sometimes when you stand in this pulpit
[1:29:20] it's awkward
[1:29:28] we're way out in the aleutian islands
[1:29:30] getting ready to leave and go back to
[1:29:32] anchorage and then home
[1:29:34] and i had a ticket in my pocket
[1:29:36] to get on an airplane the pastor came up
[1:29:39] and he said listen i can save you money
[1:29:42] i said how's that
[1:29:44] he said i flew a small airplane up here
[1:29:47] and i fly a small airplane and i can
[1:29:49] take you in my little airplane and you
[1:29:51] can save your ticket and this did not
[1:29:53] sound i said gee thank you so very very
[1:29:55] much
[1:29:56] but i've got this ticket we'll just make
[1:29:58] our way on home me and this other lawyer
[1:30:00] with me
[1:30:02] he said no no no you got to do it you
[1:30:03] got to do it and against every better
[1:30:06] judgment i had
[1:30:08] i said okay well we went out to the
[1:30:10] airport
[1:30:11] took us by his little plane and i looked
[1:30:13] at it
[1:30:14] and i thought well one good thing it's
[1:30:16] shiny then he walked around it
[1:30:19] we got in
[1:30:21] he's on the left front i'm on the right
[1:30:23] front the other lawyer's sitting right
[1:30:25] behind me
[1:30:26] and he started it up and it started up
[1:30:28] just fine well we taxied out i said
[1:30:32] should we pray he said yeah that's a
[1:30:33] good idea we normally don't i said well
[1:30:35] this time we're gonna
[1:30:38] and i'm telling you i prayed five eight
[1:30:39] minutes i prayed a long time we went and
[1:30:42] got on the runway
[1:30:44] he starts down the runway the plane
[1:30:46] lifted off ever so gently and we start
[1:30:48] climbing
[1:30:49] and it's wonderful
[1:30:52] not a problem in the world we started
[1:30:54] climbing and we flew probably three four
[1:30:55] minutes
[1:30:57] and something happened that will never
[1:30:58] leave my mind
[1:31:01] the pilot turned to me and he said
[1:31:04] we're going in the clouds and i can't
[1:31:06] fly in clouds they make me pass out i
[1:31:09] said clouds make you do what
[1:31:12] now it's been cloudy all day and we go
[1:31:16] right up into the clouds and you can't
[1:31:18] see anything
[1:31:20] and he looks at me and his eyes roll
[1:31:22] back in his head
[1:31:25] and he starts mumbling
[1:31:27] and he passes out passed out cold now i
[1:31:30] grabbed him and i shook him and i said
[1:31:31] come on you got to wake up so i can kill
[1:31:33] you now we are in the clouds flying
[1:31:35] along with no pilot and my friend in the
[1:31:37] back seat said we're dead aren't we i
[1:31:39] said there's a very good chance of that
[1:31:41] yes he said what are we going to do i
[1:31:43] said i don't know but there was a radio
[1:31:45] right there and i handed him the
[1:31:47] microphone and i said start asking for
[1:31:49] help so he's in the back seat reaching
[1:31:51] up and he said hello hello we didn't
[1:31:53] know any proper radio etiquette all we
[1:31:55] were saying was hello and somebody
[1:31:57] answered back hello hello don't you guys
[1:31:59] know proper radio etiquette and i said i
[1:32:01] said we don't know nothing tell them
[1:32:03] we're in an airplane with a passed out
[1:32:05] pilot and we don't know how to fly this
[1:32:07] plane the guy said i'm a freighter
[1:32:09] flying out of anchorage on the way to
[1:32:11] tokyo and he said you're telling me you
[1:32:12] have nobody who can fly that plane with
[1:32:14] you said tell them that's correct now
[1:32:16] you've got to understand i am sweating
[1:32:18] bullets he said the first thing i'm
[1:32:20] going to do is start circling so i don't
[1:32:22] lose you
[1:32:23] because i'll fly out of range of your
[1:32:25] radio and you won't have me anymore
[1:32:28] and he said i'm going to get anchorage
[1:32:29] emergency for you an anchorage emergency
[1:32:32] will be the people that can maybe help
[1:32:34] you
[1:32:35] try to save your life after about five
[1:32:37] minutes anchorage came on said we
[1:32:39] understand you have a passed out pilot
[1:32:41] and those of you do not know how to fly
[1:32:43] that plane we said that's right they
[1:32:45] said well the first thing we got to do
[1:32:46] is find you now never forget what this
[1:32:49] man at anchorage said he said
[1:32:51] my job is to get you home safe he said
[1:32:54] that's my job but he said here's the
[1:32:55] deal if you want me to get you home safe
[1:32:58] you got to promise me you'll obey my
[1:33:00] voice he said you can't see me but i can
[1:33:02] see you and he said if you're not going
[1:33:04] to obey my voice
[1:33:06] you're going to die
[1:33:07] when you can't see anything
[1:33:09] you have no idea how disorientated you
[1:33:11] become
[1:33:12] finally he said okay i found you now
[1:33:14] hear me clear
[1:33:16] he said you're four minutes from a
[1:33:18] mountain he said you're gonna crash in
[1:33:20] that mountain and die follow my voice i
[1:33:22] never said
[1:33:24] i have to follow your voice
[1:33:28] is that reasonable you see i understood
[1:33:31] without his voice
[1:33:33] i had nothing and do you understand
[1:33:36] without god's voice you have nothing
[1:33:40] nothing
[1:33:42] finally he got us turned and he said i'm
[1:33:44] freezing all the traffic in the area he
[1:33:47] said it's going to take me an hour and a
[1:33:48] half to get you to anchorage and there's
[1:33:50] a lot of weather between you and
[1:33:51] anchorage you're in for a rough ride and
[1:33:53] he said i want you to hear me i don't
[1:33:55] want you to look at what's going on
[1:33:56] outside i don't want you to pay
[1:33:58] attention to the storm just my voice he
[1:34:01] said if you start watching the storm you
[1:34:04] will die
[1:34:05] but i'll take you through it
[1:34:07] now because they cleared all the traffic
[1:34:09] several pilots
[1:34:11] those nighttime freighters o747 started
[1:34:14] talking to us
[1:34:18] they said we're praying for you men
[1:34:23] you're going to make it
[1:34:26] but listen to the voice
[1:34:29] that's the key they said trust the voice
[1:34:32] you realize your head is full of voices
[1:34:34] and everybody in this world wants to
[1:34:36] talk to you and everybody wants to be
[1:34:38] the controlling voice and god says i
[1:34:41] want you to be a living sacrifice i want
[1:34:44] you to put yourself on the altar and let
[1:34:46] my voice be your voice finally we went
[1:34:48] through the worst of the weather but
[1:34:50] there was still more
[1:34:51] and then the voice came back and it said
[1:34:53] now
[1:34:54] i'm going to line you up he said i'm
[1:34:56] going to bring you in right down the
[1:34:58] runway and at the foot of the runway are
[1:35:00] some lights and they're in the form of a
[1:35:02] cross he said don't you forget this
[1:35:05] the cross is the way home
[1:35:10] finally he's bringing us down
[1:35:13] we still can't see anything
[1:35:16] and all he kept saying is stay with me
[1:35:18] my sheep the bible says hear my voice
[1:35:21] and they follow me
[1:35:23] finally just a couple hundred feet off
[1:35:25] the ground we saw the cross
[1:35:27] i landed the plane
[1:35:29] in fact i landed it seven times
[1:35:33] finally it all came to a stop and the
[1:35:34] minute we stopped the pilot woke up the
[1:35:37] voice said
[1:35:39] thanks for listening
[1:35:43] i watch them crash and burn all the time
[1:35:46] because they won't follow my voice
[1:35:48] they don't understand i'm the one who
[1:35:50] can see them even when they can't see me
[1:35:53] but they get the voices in their head
[1:35:55] and they kill themselves
[1:35:58] they self-destruct
[1:36:01] thanks for listening to the voice
[1:36:03] then they put us in a motel room in
[1:36:05] about
[1:36:06] four in the morning
[1:36:09] the knock at my door
[1:36:11] i opened the door and
[1:36:13] a man was standing and he said hello
[1:36:15] david
[1:36:16] i said you're the voice you're the one
[1:36:18] who got me home
[1:36:21] he said i
[1:36:22] am you understand one day you're going
[1:36:25] to stand before him and say you were the
[1:36:27] voice
[1:36:29] you're the voice that brought me
[1:36:32] home
[1:36:34] if you're not on that altar as a living
[1:36:36] sacrifice
[1:36:40] your head's full of voices
[1:36:42] and then we wonder why kids crash and
[1:36:44] burn
[1:36:46] we wonder why marriages are shattered
[1:36:51] and the lord's saying i'm the one
[1:36:54] who has the voice all i can remember is
[1:36:56] that voice saying stay with me
[1:37:00] stay with me
[1:37:02] don't listen to what's going on in your
[1:37:04] head and don't watch the storm stay with
[1:37:06] me
[1:37:10] and i'll take you through
[1:37:12] tonight you have a god
[1:37:15] who has promised to take you through
[1:37:20] a living sacrifice
[1:37:32] holy can't see me
[1:37:36] you can't see me
[1:37:38] but i can see you
[1:37:40] that's what the lord said
[1:37:43] or what uh
[1:37:44] what symbolized the lord in the story
[1:37:48] elijah
[1:37:50] went up
[1:37:52] to the mountain
[1:37:53] he was scared to death
[1:37:57] but he had spent the time with god that
[1:37:59] he
[1:38:00] needed he went up to the mountain
[1:38:04] he found himself in a cave
[1:38:09] he's praying and
[1:38:10] asking the lord for things
[1:38:14] and then the lord passed by and there
[1:38:16] was a great wind
[1:38:19] a tornado came and elijah ripped the
[1:38:22] rocks out of the side of the mountain
[1:38:25] but elijah had been with god
[1:38:27] he knew that
[1:38:28] god was not in it went
[1:38:32] and then as he as he continued his quest
[1:38:36] to hear the voice of god
[1:38:40] and he was praying an earthquake shook
[1:38:42] the whole mountain
[1:38:45] but god
[1:38:46] was not in the earthquake
[1:38:50] and then
[1:38:51] a fire
[1:38:53] came down and swept through
[1:38:56] but god was not in the fire
[1:38:59] friends how many times would we make
[1:39:01] that mistake
[1:39:03] if we're praying about something
[1:39:06] and we hear we hear a great wind or an
[1:39:09] earthquake or a fire but we're not
[1:39:11] mature enough in the lord like elijah
[1:39:13] was
[1:39:15] to know that that's not god
[1:39:19] and then
[1:39:21] a still
[1:39:22] small
[1:39:23] voice
[1:39:25] a still
[1:39:27] small
[1:39:28] voice
[1:39:29] spoke
[1:39:32] god
[1:39:33] he followed that voice and then elijah
[1:39:36] eventually
[1:39:37] got his
[1:39:38] answer let's stand friends
[1:39:45] i'm sorry to keep you i kept you a few
[1:39:47] minutes over
[1:39:49] but by the grace of god we have a voice
[1:39:55] that we can hear but we have to do our
[1:39:58] part
[1:40:00] to hear that voice
[1:40:03] we have to do our part
[1:40:06] to
[1:40:08] be a mature enough christian like this
[1:40:11] man elijah was
[1:40:14] that we can
[1:40:15] distinguish
[1:40:17] between the voice of baal
[1:40:19] and the voice of jesus just like elijah
[1:40:23] did
[1:40:24] friends i am
[1:40:26] so grateful
[1:40:29] that
[1:40:29] we have a voice
[1:40:32] we um
[1:40:34] we have a voice that was prophesied to
[1:40:36] come in this day
[1:40:37] and we can hear it
[1:40:39] it can help make that voice of god clear
[1:40:43] to us
[1:40:45] and the more that
[1:40:47] that
[1:40:48] we are in this word here
[1:40:52] the um
[1:40:54] more clear that that voice will be
[1:40:57] and as that that man that lawyer said
[1:41:01] and as the the tower told them he said i
[1:41:04] can see you
[1:41:05] but you can't see me
