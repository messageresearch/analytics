that the wheels of god grind slow but they grind eternally fine that he knows what he's doing in our lives and he'll accomplish that which he desired to accomplish there's a braised report written in from sister amelia that the physical therapy went pretty well except for today it was a little painful though thank god i'm doing a lot better so i thank the lord for that how many have something they're thankful today so that we can say lord you've been good to me amen we're gonna listen to the second half of the tape we started a little while back it's called jesus keeps all his appointments from 1964. so we're gonna play that in just a minute here let's let's um let's just say i come to the garden alone key of g you believe he walks with you and talks with you amen i come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses [Music] and the voice i hear falling on my ears the sun of god discloses [Music] and he walks with me and he talks [Music] tells me i am his all and the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known he speaks and the sound of his ward is so sweet the birds hush they're singing and the man that he gave to me within my heart is [Applause] and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own and the joy we share as we tear there none other has ever known amen as we pray this as we play this tape let's just listen to hear him walking with us talking with us here with the spirit saying to the churches god bless you the word can be made manifest among us and we still walk and let people talk about it oh my god but you know to hurry with our story let's change the scene tonight let's turn our cameras another way way down in the alley a little old dirty alley way up at the top of a little old room that was bar by the bar the door comes open and a woman steps out well she wasn't very well liked among the people she was a center and she made her living in the wrong way so she strolls out down the little creaking steps she gets into the alley and she goes down all along the garbage cans and goes out on the street well there's nobody out there so she begins to wonder what's oh i remember pharisee up there pastor pharisee he's uh given a big banquet everybody's up there business will be bad today so she mows these down the street and as she begins to walk and say well i'll just have to wait till that's over and she made her living in a bad way so she was walking down the street after a while her little hungry stomach smell that roasted lamb my heart smells good never had anything like that to eat my life maybe been turned out on the street by some parents you know a lot of times we think about juvenile delinquency i think a whole lot of it is parent delinquency the kids have been taught to pray and serve god instead of mama out somewhere at a card party and her religious card party and dad out of the golf course somewhere and sister out with junior out there on the street running around maybe things have been different had the old-fashioned prayer altar the bible instead of a deck of cards and throwed that television out the door a long time ago and it might have been a whole lot different you all used to be wrong go to pictures show the devil put it right over on her she brought it right in her house she's hungry she smelled man she said my smells good i wonder really how a piece of roasted lamb would really taste in a human's mouth i don't know how it would be i believe i'll just walk up now she couldn't get too close to him because she was a woman they were self-righteous you see they all belong to church so they couldn't get around where is that she was considered a sinner so if she walked up close and if you didn't look around seen all of them standing there in the water running out of their mouth is a gasp you know looking at this ram or lamb in there roasting and all the fine foods and things being packed around in there what a great time and she began to look through the crowd like that and her eyes fell upon me who's that he's got dirty feet i wonder who that what if somebody would tell me say well you turns away real quick won't nothing do with her she's a sinner so ask somebody else finally maybe a little lady that was believing and looking the same way said uh madam would pardon me but would you who is that sitting there how did that person well he said you know who that is did you hear him talk about that jesus of nazareth is supposed to be a prophet oh yes is that him that's him well he isn't washed i understood that everybody's forced to be washed before they come in there and anointed look at him well it's not right she had an opportunity presented to her she remembered a story that someone told her another woman of her trade one time up in in the samaria the city of psycho had been forgiven of every sin and she realized that that might be an opportunity for her so how is she going to get to him now she seen he was needy and she wanted to serve him and couldn't get to him that's about the way it is so she thought what can i do he has no anointing his feet's dirty nobody's paying attention oh if i could only get in there that's the real pin at heart if i can only get to it now she think get her mind catches something you know what i believe i'll do i know down the street she goes just as quick as she can down through the alley up this little creaky steps and opens the door goes in there and gets a stocking top you know and pulls it out counts how much money she's got she said hi is that enough to buy some anointing oil let's see if it is there's 20 pieces of roman denarii perhaps that's enough but wait i can't do that he's a prophet and he'll know where i got that money he'll know how i got it i just can't do it so she perhaps laid it back again and once she laid it back it was something kept speaking to her heart but would you let him sit there dirty like that would you let the only man that can take away your sins set dirty when you can give him service so she says to herself whether he knows or not i'm going down the street she went and run into a store where these little hook those fellas sitting in there well what do you want to hear she said i want the best alabaster ointment that you got not the cheapest i want the best she had a special reason and that's what we ought to do we are to give him our best everything we are our youthful life not wait till we're old and dying give the best we got to him and there she got the very best he went up said let's see how much money that is and he got the money first he knew her also so i said yes she had the money so where you going with this i have it for a special occasion so she goes up now she has no invitation but how's she going to get in but somehow if you want to do a service for jesus he'll make a way for you get in somehow another she got in and there was jesus sitting there yet and she had to think which got in there heart beating real fast oh my what if he'd happen to turn me down there's a lot of things to think about what if he'd come up here and say say you foul woman what are you doing here in my presence know you not that i'm a son of god you shouldn't be here in my presence her heart almost failed and she thought what can i do but i've got to get to him i can't pass this time this may be the last opportunity i'll have it might be yours too look down and her heart begin to swell up she she knows she's in his presence there's something happens when you get in his presence she noticed the tears began to fall off of her cheeks and she was sitting there shaking this box in her hand and she fell down at his feet and she thought i can't look up i'm so guilty and dirty i can't look up so she started crying they began to fall upon his feet and she began to wash him like that with her hands white and trying to wipe the tears off of his feet and washing his feet with her tears and after a while she didn't have no towel to wipe his feet with so her hair was hanging down and she began to wipe his feet with the hair that was on her head more than our sisters have a time doing that they'd have to stand on their head to do it our sisters today what if you one of the women realize that god keeps all his promise i wonder if you realize that it's totally impossible for you to get in like that he keeps all of his promises do you realize what you're doing when you're doing that you're denying virtue the bible said that if a woman kebabs her hair is even a common thing for her even prey and she dishonors her husband in doing so and remember it was a woman that broke one commandment of god that caused all this to do that do you think one breaking one will get back in think of it maybe sometimes ministers hasn't gotten nerve enough to tell you this is one time you're going to hear it it's the truth someone said why don't you leave off that women a great man told me that not long ago said well they believe you're a prophet you teach them how to receive the holy ghost and get these great big things and how to to be prophets and so forth i said i teach them greater things i said how can i teach them algebra when they won't even learn their abcs it shows the outside expresses what's on the inside but you go on to it anyhow why you're not conscious of it amen there she was with her hair she began to wipe his feet with it rhymes feed on she was scared to death that's why she picked up this bottom ointment she broke it and she tried to hit it and break it and put it on his feet and she was crying and every time she'd cry she reached out and kissed his feet she got hysterically when you get this presence it makes you hysterically i got hysterically any man ever gets in his presence that's weaves him and has faith in him it'll make you hysterically on the day of pentecost when you come in the form of the holy ghost thank god hysterically when you really believe and you know and recognize it's your opportunity and you're in his presence you're sure of it she'd kiss his feet and cry and wash him white and kiss his feet again you know jesus if he had moved one foot she'd have jumped up and run out there you know he just said let her do it you know if you want to do something for him he lets you do it it may be all out of order but he lets you in and he was doing him a service and she was washing his feet and he just sat there and looked at her she was free to look up because freddie would make her scat and see she was washing his feet his opportunity to do something foreign and she was just i see when he when jesus spoke back to the pharisee he justified her by her works but when he justified her to herself he justified by her faith thy faith is saved he showed pharisee what her works was because your works expresses your faith now let your hair grow out now see it expresses what you believe or not that's god's word there's no scripture in the bible but what that's the truth why do you do it now notice too much hollywood in pentecost that's what's the matter amen now we find out that's the truth it's just too much hollywood you watch these things and pattern yourself a lady said to me not long ago she said little tight dress on i said why don't you take that off of being a sister and she said well brother grandma don't make any other clothes i said they make sewing machines and they got goods i think you just want to i'll tell you why let me tell you sister thank you one of these days you're going to have to answer for committing adultery you say well brother brown i miss this pure to my husband as i can be i miss pure to my boyfriend that might be so too but jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her half committed adultery with her already in his heart and if you've presented yourself out there and that sinner thinks that about you because you presented yourself that the day of the judgment when he answers for committing adultery who's guilty think of it that's exactly right oh women come home back sisters come back to christ brothers you do the same and you man let your wife do that and call yourself a man head of the house notice we're in a terrible time friend and we're noticing here it was this little woman kissing his feet and washing his feet and whitening with her hairs of her head and all at once old pharisee within a corner he happened to notice it oh my his righteous ignatian rose and his his big chin swelled out his face looked like would burst oh my he said come here look here look over there and he said within his own heart now in his his mind he said if that man was a prophet he would know what manner of woman that is touched him see if he is a prophet or not see he perceived the thoughts that was in his heart and all at once he moved and the little woman raised to look up her eyes blaring he looked over and he said simon he said i i got something to say to you here you are simon i got something to say to you you invited me here i'll come on your invitation you invited me and when i come to the door you never wash my feet and when i come in you're never anointed my head you let me come in dirty and you never kiss me welcome though you invited me but this woman here let her be whatever she may be she has washed my feet with her tears she's wiped him with the hairs of her head and she has anointed my feet and constantly kissed my feet ever since she's been laying there he found out what he's a prophet or not then he said simon i want you to look at something he said what kind of i'll give you a riddle said when a uh much as forgiven uh uh much as love and he gave him the saying and simon answered him back notice simon didn't give him anything to wash his feet with but he had the best water that could be just think the tears of a repented sinner washing the dirt off of jesus feet tears out of a sinner's eyes washing the dirt from his feet oh man and women tonight when you see the reproach upon the gospel and we're so starchy we take all the makeup off of our face if we cried a tear we look horrible and get on the street what are you going to be when you face the portals of heaven on her and there she was she washed his feet kissed his feet and would anointed him and doing everything as she could because she wanted forgiveness and all of a sudden she she wonder what he's going to do now he had showed simon and that backfired on him the thing that he said he was the prophet was proved that he was a prophet that he was the word of god now he's standing there with his face swelled out either grab that little woman thought her out of the church but she got what she asked for amen imagine what the rest of them said she got what she asked for now he turns to her her little heart begin to beat real fast now what's he going to say there she is all of her pretty curls is hanging all down over her waist here and her her eyes are streaking with tears and her face and lips are all greasy where she's been kissing his feet and actually put that arm on him she sure looks messed up but then great big eyes looking to see what's going to say he said in ah say unto her all her sins which are many are forgiven that's it all her sins are forgiven that's what i want to hear oh that's the words that i don't know i don't care what the rest of him says i'm ready to stand in his denomination and declare that he is the word of god i don't care what they say let people turn on if you want to send a mind reader fortune teller whatever you want to i'm ready to kiss the reproach from him it's his word certainly he promised that he is the word just as much today as he was then you said so now friend there may be people sitting here that can't agree that he's the prophet you might not agree that he's a healer but there's one thing that every church member should agree he's a savior and i want to say this before closing not long ago a attorney friend of mine was trying a case of a man and woman that it was going to separate the attorney was a fine christian gentleman he said don't don't separate he tried his best to keep him from it but not this determined there was going to be something come up between them after a while he said well if you got the home down there you better go down and divide the spoils because if they have to get them down and lawyers and things get into it you know what's going to happen they'll take every bit of it so they went into the rooms to divide up what they had they went into the parlor they fussed and stood obliged this and i had this and they went on in the next room and divided in there and finally went up in the attic they had a remember they had an old trunk up there they got in there and began to say well this belonged to my mama this was my mama's like that they got down in the trunk a piece both of them kneeling on the floor with the trunk right open dividing up what was what they couldn't agree that belongs to me i paid for that i've done the work i stayed home when you did it fussing finally they raised up something else and both of them grabbed the same time what was it a little pair of shoes from a little baby that had been born to that union that god had taken they couldn't argue they had something in common as they held her hands he remembered that she was a mother that baby he remembered she was a mother she remembered he was a father as they helped the little shoes in their hands they pulled one another to each other put their arms around each other the divorce case was involved wow they found something they had in common you might have disagreed with me this week to see the holy spirit come in confirm these words and things do you might disagree with that you might disagree with the sick being healed but we do have one thing in common that's the blood of jesus christ that saves us from sins will you wash the dirt from his feet tonight let us bow our heads just a moment remember he keeps every promise he keeps every promise he promised though your sins be a scarlet they shall be wise know all your sins are forgiven you if you'll just believe it with our heads bound i wonder how many here will raise your hand and say brother branham i want to rest in my life i want to not let him sit and be disgraced and i have an opportunity like the little woman did i want to with my testimony to wash the dirt from him his precious name will you raise your hand say pray for me brother adam ah god bless you god bless you that's fine now heavenly father there were many many hands that went up here just now and we see that the name of jesus christ has been stomped into the dirt and everything in heaven's name that everything on earth is named then every every church member every member of the body of christ is miss jesus and we pray heavenly father that we'll see and understand that tonight may your grace come upon these people and forgive every sin that they know that in your presence now and know that you're here let your holy spirit teach us all now and may we be forgiven of all of our sins and our mistakes and from tonight on may we be new creatures fill with your spirit granted may we be conscious of your presence for we asked it in his name and while we have our heads bound i wonder tonight i'm talking to sinners and to church members and the backsliders and to those who have not the holy ghost i'm talking to you why didn't pharisee accept him we'll keep calling for him oh lord will you come when your baby was sick you called for him he was merciful no doubt when he's about to see that wreck out there you called on him he let you get out of it but i wonder just wonder well all these things that we ask him and we invite him then when he comes to visit us like this wonder if we're just ashamed to say well i've been a member of a church but i want to find him the baptism of the holy ghost tonight i want him i need him i don't care what the rest of the world says about it i want him would you like to have the baptism of the holy spirit if you would i'm going to ask you to do something i want you to come up here right here where i am now come right down here and stand right at this pit right here behind me every person in here every unsaved person first will you walk up here and stand here just a minute if you believe that he hears prayer will you come here and stand here just a minute now while we sing one verse of a song what is that softly and tenderly jesus is calling all right with our heads about everybody pray come right up here and stand here right down here in this paper jesus come will you friend anywhere you are calling for you jesus in this last days just before he's appearing in physical form sitting with dirty feet are you willing to come take your stand and take the reproach off of his name [Music] get out quickly now make up your mind come right on now we got plenty of time tomorrow sunday sunday school don't start till 9 30. come on [Music] do you realize jesus is here [Music] that's right come on out of the balcony come right on up each this means you're alive what happens look at the earthquakes all over the earth shaking the earth again look what's happening everywhere the time is in hand and look the door will be closed after a while and you'll cry to get in he can't [Music] i talked to a young woman some time ago i was holding a meeting in a baptist church and i asked her that night to come to christ and she wouldn't do it and then afterwards she met me outside and said don't you never embarrass me like that again a year later i pass through the streets she's an honorable young girl i pass through the street or underneath skirts hanging down smoking a cigarette going down the street she's a deacon's daughter and i said hello there aren't uh she said hello preach such a slang is that hello preach i said aren't you ashamed that cigarette she said hey would you like a little drink out of my bottle she's half drunk and i said aren't you ashamed of yourself she said come here i'll take you to where i stay i said aren't you at home no i said what's the matter she said take a little drink out of my bottle i'll tell you i said aren't you ashamed of yourself to offer me a drink out of a bottle or a cigarette she said i want to tell you something preacher you know that night she told me that was my last chance i said yes i remember she said you were right she said since then my soul's been so hard she said now here's the remark it just runs shivers over my back she said i could see my own mother soul frying hell like a pancake in life would you want to get in that stage don't you turn him down so right now won't you come stand here at the rest of these come home come turn him away that's what happened remember you'll [Music] he keeps all of his appointments and you've got one with him you're going to meet him at the judgment our meeting here [Music] you know i'm so surprised my heart feels real funny i thought today when i was praying had another message i was going to speak on he told me do that he told me to say that i thought every bob inherited woman would be standing here that overcome see you just get so hard and so far away you pass that line between that surging say not hearing the word of god i thought surely it would happen but i guess maybe it's later and i really think remember the blood is not upon my hands i have not shunned to declare you the counsel of god the way it is remember there's something inside identifying the outside get away from it sister dear brother get her by the hand come on up here why don't you won't you be once you want to be a real christian watch used to live that halfway life and living under condemnation don't you do that so you say well i i don't care what you've done your fruits is what you're known by i cross america constantly every year across it gets worse and worse so i know there's something wrong the day of grace is passing by don't let that happen to you here in tampa you're here in a great big fabulous city where everything's full of glamour just like hollywood the whole world has become contaminated all on televisions and things there's some old vlogger dirty stuff and you try to pattern yourself like that once you take jesus example once you let him once you listen to his word won't you do these things that's right how many in here will honestly say that you know you haven't got the holy ghost look at yourself in the mirror and know you have it no just look at your own life and the way you do not because you belong to church i belong to methodist baptist praise john that's all right i say nothing against that but i'm asking you to you know christ jesus is he living in you if he does he'll identify himself there if he's there he's bound to let himself be known you can't hide him he stands out you haven't got the holy ghost and you know you haven't raise up your hand be that honest say i haven't got the holy ghost i know i am god bless you for that sincerity god will honor that sincerity if you want the holy ghost once you come stand here with these now these penitent sinners here won't you come at this time come up and stand while we sing it again say i want it brother brandon i'll tell you that it takes that's you're going to have to have it for the rapture it's exactly right now you remember do you believe that god speaks to you you believe that's jesus christ raise up your hand if you believe this week you've been in the meetings you believe it's christ all right then your place is at the altar women's shame on you man shame on you for letting her do it you man out here doing those things and some of you ministers that almighty dollar instead of almighty god's word let that congregation get that kind of shape this because some organization you read the same bible i read just shame to yourself jesus with dirty feet and haven't you got the real christian spunk about you to stand up and take up for it look like you should god be merciful i pray that god will send the holy ghost and conviction just now that'll make this congregation realize where it's said are you conscious that this is your opportunity are you going to do like that courier did pass up your last opportunity are you going to do that don't you do it if there's a doubt any worse something wrong can you hear your place right down here take your place this is your place say well i don't want no need well do you think it went overseas set there they could have went and identified themselves but it's against their congregation but wasn't against him that little woman didn't care she knows she is a sinner she got forgiveness i don't know what happened where are they at tonight why is that woman at tonight you think and where is pharisee at tonight though religious if you could hear them both where they're at you sure take her place any time so no matter how religious you are if you jesus keeps every appointment every commandment you have to answer for so you better come now if you haven't got the holy ghost he commanded you to he said in the book of acts peter did said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to them as far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and as long as he's still calling he's still given the holy ghost while we sing again won't you come that's my last time now remember christ has been hearing you all raise your hands identified that it was him in his word and down that christ in my heart is greed jesus set up over jerusalem one time said jerusalem jerusalem how awful would i have hovered you as a hint those are bru but you would not a lot of times i come amongst as i sold you this morning in the breakfast you find pentecostal people and all kinds of people when i come among you the holy spirit down in you said how off would i have to gather them how the church had been standing today in his power but you would not see you would not once you do it now this is the time lay aside every weight that's the sin that doesn't easily beset you let's run with patience the race is set before us while we call one more time everybody sing with me now get right up and come up here if you haven't got the baptism of the spirit of your center backslider whatever you are come on up let's pray together with you now this is our last call softly and tenderly [Music] is [Music] is [Music] what a fair she could hear that old recall tonight sitting back there what would he do [Music] he sent his way hey wait will you do the same thing what if that courier boy could stand before him again what would be the first thing [Music] [Music] oh [Music] or have you passed that place is there still a tender spot in there if there is a pump let him come in take it over right there he'll make you a new creature your boy you're the happiest person you ever was calling [Music] now let's hum it [Music] come on are you concerned if you're convinced then you're concerned but if you're not convinced yet that it's jesus then you can't be concerned [Music] about us [Music] [Music] gate said let's see if your name show in the books said it isn't he said the lot of the minister said i can't have what you were if your name's not on here you can't enter the store just like high court years now you have to have the name of the book and he said well what can i do he said you might have beaten your face if you want to to this god's white throne judgment old brother sister don't ever want to go there so he said i guess i have no other people so he said look like he had started going somewhere i didn't know where was that this is the name he said i would come into a life there's no certain place that was coming forward but it got slower while i stopped i heard a boy said who approaches my support [Music] all right have you appealed your case to stand in my courts he said then i require justice he said i have the commandments said danny martin did you ever lie in your life he said i thought i've been a truthful man but sit in the presence of that light i realized that set some things ashamed she said uh yes sir i told lies he said did you ever steal he said i thought i've been honest but i'd see some deals then when you get the presence of that light you think you're all right now but this week you get there trying to approach it one time with bob there smoking cigarettes just trying to do you think i'm just saying that i'll prove it to you now in the scripture here exactly wearing a pair of slacks shorts find out where you're at the bible says an abomination to the sight of god said well did you ever do this or that yes he said and danny if you ever see it he said yes i see he's just about to hear he said his bones looked like he was coming out of the joint to hear that depart into everlasting hell for my presence said he heard the sweetest voice he ever heard he said he looked around and said he'd seen the sweetest face that he ever saw said he said father that's true that he tried to live in everything that he known how to live but he did do wrong but one thing he did down on earth he stood for me he stood up for me stuck up for me and all my work now i'll stand for him here that's what you're doing now you're making a stand for him here he'll make a stand for you before the founder lord jesus i pray that you will be merciful and grant the forgiveness of these people's sins they've come here to make a stand they each want to be filled with the holy ghost grant if you'll be given to them i claim that lord for your glory while they stand before this audience as a witness some of them are church members some of them are backsliders some of them have never accepted you before and they're standing here and they see the dirt that follows a real true christian confession and they're ready now to take their stand to that woman to confess their sinners but with their tears of repentance they want to wash the dirt from your neighbors grant that they can do it i'm going to ask you one thing we'll be out here before the public right here if you [Music] is want [Music] [Music] the attitude you take now you feel like that you're well enough all right that's between you and god i'm not going to judge i'm just responsible for the word they come out of churches too but they're going to settle right now it's all of us they're ready why don't we live a halfway christian life or either be far gone or be against them so the world they're going to be crucified to the things of the world in the fashions of this glamorous day where you are going to die to jesus christ whose presence is your right now they're going to die to themselves to be born new to jesus christ god bless this or someone else will come while we sing asleep [Music] [Music] wow [Music] the holy spirit [Music] to you jesus christ when you receive when you receive will you my sister for you my brother come and make her renew your vows that you will [Music] [Music] today from georgia she's got a great big tumor on the inside of her it's very bad off she'll believe she can be healed she's just coming her name is miss turner you'll jesus christ will make you well you believe it you believe in god are you a stranger you don't have no prayer card you just come in today somebody come and got you you come down here from the state of georgia you believe [Music] all right now you know it's totally impossible for me to know that because you just come in this water one sitting on here that's right raise up your hands now the same holy spirit is saying that it's just pumping against the people right here hallelujah he's identified folks don't don't do that you're making a rational mistake amen i love you remember you come to hear me and i appreciate that love is correct you see your kid out in the street would you say just say junior you want to do that you'll make him stay in if you love him love is correct i have to scold you remember it's even your offerings and things to pay for this meeting it makes it possible for to be here do i love you with all of my heart sister you might think i've got something against you for doing the things you do it is that i have anything against you sister it's my godly love for you someone said if he's a little bit younger you wouldn't think that i thought this when i was 14 years old the bible says so it's the same thing don't make that mistake don't you trust in speaking in tongues for the holy ghost only to speak sometimes don't you trust that doing the things that you're doing dancing in this spirit is some kind of a sensation christ is a person certainly and he's the word and if he's in there he always makes his work work just exactly the way it's supposed to you turn it down how can it be christ [Music] the door's [Music] he said in the days when the son of man will be revealed he's the same yesterday the very same jesus if set with dirty feet would he back up a hypocrite would he back up somebody didn't know his word that's identification that does hold the word i'm telling you true don't pass it um [Music] come home god have mercy have mercy can't you feel that breathing asleep tenderly [Music] jesus is calling all [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] smoking's not a sin drink is not a sin cursing is not a sin committing adultery is not a scene no no that's attributes of unbelief you do that because you're not believing there's only two one you are a believer or you're not a leader if you're not a leader no matter how religious you are you're still a sinner you're still a sinner if you don't accept every word every word of it or both heavens and earth will pass away but not one child or one tenta will pass from that and we will give an account you say well i belong to church my people don't i don't know how to do this i don't care what you've done you're either a believer or a sinner that's pretty strong but i'm just saying this because the same one that knows the hearts of it is telling me to say it are you finished i see two more coming i'm just waiting because i don't know it might be somebody else just one moment why don't you come get in while the water's trouble now be a great thing just in a few minutes back here come watch it raise something there make your mouth of god lord god forgive me for what i've done i promise you i've said i was a christian but lord there's something in me tells me i i i'm condemned right now in the presence of this one it's identifying himself as the lord jesus christ i'm condemned write my own heart and knowing it him you're making this so plain i'm condemned i'm going in to make this right right now i'll pledge about right here that from this night on i'll absolutely live for him i should do that all if right all now let's stand up for you out there i wish i could sing i'd like to sing that song forgive [Music] one more and believe that you're anchored in christ and you're ready for the coming judgment and you'll be able and when the trumpet sounds there won't be one thing to do and be caught away it'll be done so quick you won't have time to read the house in a moment in a twinkling of an eye what would it be one of these days whatever you've missed forever for eternity forever ever ever what will this little time of worldly pleasure mean nothing now i think we all are to dedicate our lives out here to christ don't you think so how many like to rededicate your lives upon this tonight i'll rededicate myself right now lord now think of what the what your besetting sin is and let's just raise our hands now to god each one in your own way remember he's omnipresent while he's maybe 1800 or 2000 praying in here there's millions of praying around the world at the same time and he hears every one of them there's not even a sparrow can fall in the street but what he knows that he knows every secret of your heart let's all pray now in our own way let's dedicate ourselves to christ lord jesus uh uh your presence was so great just a few moments ago i could hardly even catch my breath seem like it i was going to leave and i know that there's some reason that you want this done this way i i don't understand it but you do lord you're god but you've clearly identified yourself you're here we believe you we know you're here and here in the building is hundreds of hands up we're dedicating ourself a new lord upon this pulpit where i've preached and seen you stand here identifying yourself this week i reconsecrate myself i dedicate myself anew to your service forgive me of all my complaints about being tired and god just take me in your arms take all of us lord pack us away from this worldly care and these worldly things lord that we might be holy consecrated dedicated service of the lord jesus christ granted father hear us tonight bless those back to our seeking for the baptism of the holy ghost may there come a sound again from heaven like a russian mighty wind may it fill every person in there with a fire from off the altar of god granted lord we praise you we give you thanks and praise for for receiving us we give you thanks and praise for your people we praise you because you said if we'll confess our sins god is just to forgive them granted lord that we'll all be forgiven and tomorrow we'll see the greatest healing meeting this country's ever seen because of our confession granted lord we consecrate ourselves to thee in jesus christ [Music] that last half an hour of that sermon where god in his great mercy is reaching out and saying come back to me and i sat there in the room listening to that and they said lord let each one of us always never be ashamed never say lord i don't have time now but just even brother brandon reconsecrating his life right there and he said god is calling god is pulling just made me stop and think lord what about my life you know where's that fervency or where's that joy that i once had where's that forgive me and try me one more time even as david said and you know i said well that was for sinners without the grace of god where are we all you know it's come by god's mercy and his grace so amen i just some people would say maybe just you know skip that part but no god speaks reaches out and just says lord let me examine myself closely and say you know and it'd be like danny martin there and you begin to realize in his presence wow i'm short here boy i failed here i lost my temper at someone the other day i but i'm i'm grateful for his blood i'm grateful for his mercy but he asks us he tells us confess and say lord help me create in me a clean heart oh god you are the potter i am in the clay created [Music] me and renew a right spirit within me cast me now and take not thy is the joy of thy salvation within me sister lily continues to play that i know talking here where there are those listening in and maybe streaming and as i sat back there i just began to examine my own life and say lord what about my life where is my attitude and i just i know sometimes we don't listen to those parts of the service we hear the word and then well that was for them but no lord just maybe just bow your heads wherever you are at home and just say for a moment here just say lord what is it in my life what is it today that would make me be ashamed of you or that would cause me to turn my back or maybe that would cause you to be ashamed of me and let me just repent of that and say lord forgive me sometimes lord when our attitudes have gotten in a way lord or our actions and things that we know better to do lord our temptation comes our way or our human flesh gets back up and lord we get we pay more attention to that lord you're sitting there right in front of us lord and we're not washing your feet we're not acknowledging you we're not giving you the praise the glory the adoration or the the service that you deserve just for what you've done for us lord forgive us lord never let it in our lives we ever get to a point lord where we could walk away just leave you sitting there with dirty feet lord but let our at the tears of joy and repentance whatever those chairs would be just wash your feet daily let us not be embarrassed lord i pray lord wherever we're at we're at work i know that the cares of work and at school or at home wherever it is and get us caught up and things going on lord well let's remember lord to always worship you and adore you and make you feel welcome lord and let you bless your children lord i pray in jesus name amen create me a queen [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] restore until the joy of my salvation holy spirit [Music] the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me the joy that comes when you know you've been forgiven and and i know where you don't base it on emotion and feelings but when god blesses you you know you've been blessed when god has forgiven you even the joy of going to someone that maybe you've offended the offended and you can make that right and there's peace about it on the pleasure and the joy that comes with that how much more to know that your sins are forgiven that all is well i appreciate the grace and the mercy of god if we'll stand together amen into my heart into my heart say well he lives there just just just let more of him come in sometimes [Music] into my heart [Music] lord jesus [Music] lord jesus [Music] lord jesus [Music] this day lord jesus [Music] how many would pledge in my day tomorrow in my work tomorrow whatever i do tomorrow lord let me stand for you let my let don't let me be embarrassed don't let me be ashamed whatever that that is that it might be you don't know what tomorrow holds but you know who holds tomorrow say yes lord and don't let me be ashamed amen appreciate his grace and appreciate his mercy so lord willing this sunday brother joe adams and his wife will be with us both services so let's come prepare to hear and receive what god has for us say lord you know i need you let me honor you let me worship you let

so much yes jesus loves me [Music] loves me yes [Music] jesus when you read that last line god keeps his word and that's god's word [Music] yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me [Music] maybe tomorrow when your co-worker or your husband or your wife or your children get you a little upset or something remind yourself the lord loves me let that love be expressed back out amen [Music] when the alarm goes off in the morning when you really don't want it to remind yourself jesus loves me we were taught we spoke the other day with brother lonnie about the prayer aspirins they work when you stop for a moment when i had that song stuck in my head i couldn't get out and i said lord can you do something about this in that song think about his love i've had to do that more than once recently something comes and i just say stop start singing that song and the the atmosphere changes immediately you can't be singing a song like that and thinking evil about something or wrong about something or be upset about so you say why it works it's the grace and the mercy of god god bless you as you go tonight oh yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me yes jesus [Music] oh [Music] he gave his life
