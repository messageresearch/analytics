[Music] let's just sing that chorus [Music] is god bless you all this is a testimony for his honor and glory um back in may um well i worked in the building where i live we have five teams that work there on the first team and back in may just before mother's day i um i went to the mail like on a friday before mother's day my sons were sending me bert mother's day card and um and i got one card for one of my son but then on saturday um i just i couldn't get in my mailbox i put the key in there but i couldn't get in my mailbox and um and so i i you know i thought it was strange i reported it to maintenance on the monkey i think either monday or tuesday um they took the lock out and discovered that there was a little twig in there that was um you know not making it possible for me to unlock my mailbox so they fixed it they had to change the lock and the key then um that happened in may and um probably on i would say on the 13th then on june the the month went through and then in june um on the third team again i discovered uh i couldn't open my mailbox on i checked it on a friday but on saturday i couldn't get in there again and um so i said it's the same thing that happened in may so um i brought it to management's attention i brought it to our maintenance and it took them almost a whole week before they could fix it but in the meantime um like i said this was on the 13th um the meantime i would go and check my mail and just to see if the maintenance had fixed it my mailbox it's on the first floor um and um and it had been fixed going back a little bit back in may um management uh changed our our ways of working there's people that work in the back dog and there's some that work up in the first floor where their mailbox are and we have to change back and forth we have to monitor the elevators and and um it's a long way but just to make it short we there's two teams that work uh every every shift anyway um so um they hadn't fixed it and one tuesday it's an ex-co worker that works at 13. and one tuesday i says i'm going to test him i'm going to see if this is a guy that's you know vandalizing my mailbox so um i you know all the time i can't get my mail out and so this one tuesday i was going down the building to come here to the church for the food program and i brought down an envelope an envelope that was sealed and nobody could see it nobody knew anything about except me and so i i brought it down i'm i went to the mail room and all the time this ex-stock monitors could watch you know he could see what i'm doing and i brought i pretended i stopped at the door of the entrance pretended like i had gotten some mail and i looked up the envelope and then i walked out with my car and then that was on a tuesday on a wednesday i just get discovered my mailbox uh vandalized again but this time there was a stick in there just shoved in there yeah i could see it but i couldn't take it out i brought it to management's attention i'm about to maintenance attention i had like about four people that could see that a little stick was jumped in there uh it took them i guess about a week um i think about a week for them to um to take it out by then i suspected that it was this ex-co-worker that was doing this and because he was the only one that knew that you know that was um i had that envelope that pretend like i had gotten male um anyway so that happened and usually it all month long it doesn't happen it doesn't happen on the first team the second team the fourth or fifth team it usually happens on the third team well uh in june when i worked just before the 13th i worked and it was the strangest thing i had never had anything like that happen this man that moved him recently brought me a bunch of mail i was working in the lobby and he brought me this mail and guess what it turned out to belong to that guy that i suspected was messed around with my mail and he brought me all this mail and he says i don't know what to do with this mail i recently moved into this apartment and i'm getting all this guy's mail and uh and they told me that he had passed away or or moved and for me just to get rid of it i looked up the mail and it turned out to be to that guy that guy's apartment all of a sudden all this mail is right in my hands and i could have told guys so anyway you know if you don't throw it away but i knew that that guy hadn't died i knew he had moved so anyway this male is there in my hands and it was like god was in control all this time i'm so stressful i was oppressed and all of a sudden all this mails my hands and i told that man no i know that man what you need to do is take it to the office and i called to the office and i told them and um and and and anyway i told him that you know about this he was taking this mail over there and then the woman called me back from the office and she says no he has to put it back in the mailbox and i go no but he continues to get this mail and so i you know it's i you know he continues getting this mail in his mailbox i really in fact i i don't even think he'd live in that apartment 1323 i think he gives him 13 22. he you know it was just coming to the wrong but before all that happened too i had run into uh i personally asked to talk to my boss management i told them that this has been happening now i can understand one time could be you know two times could be a coincidence but three times that my mailbox is getting vandalized that's gotta be i'm concerned now i'm convinced that this is not a coincidence and usually happens when this one worker is working and um they're in the lobby anyway so uh praise god now i worked on the uh the third team came on saturday i went to go check my mail like always i checked my medal every day even if there's nothing there but anyway and it was evangelized so that man received his mail which he knew i could have um i could have disposed of but this month my mailbox was not vandalized at all so i know that god was in control yeah and now i gotta find out who's vandalizing my car oh praise god i just don't know what to say so let's sing i love to proclaim reading by the blood of the lord [Music] is [Music] his child in forever [Music] [Applause] [Music] no language my rapture can tell [Music] reading [Applause] [Music] ready [Music] [Music] i think [Music] [Music] [Applause] his love is the theme of my song reading reading reading by the blood of the lamb [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] down from his glory [Music] and jesus was [Music] tears [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my the great grace [Music] one [Music] [Applause] [Music] in [Music] [Music] god [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] my [Music] then [Music] is [Music] he took the form of many [Music] sacrifice [Music] oh [Music] all a great creature [Music] amen in him was every attribute a savior a healer a redeemer and he had some some way needed to to be expressed and you and i would have maybe thought it would be different or we would have done it differently but he knew exactly how to do it he said rather than send them i'll go myself and sure do appreciate that amen we have some requests to bring to your attention and a couple of announcements so brother brother gerald petty is asking um for wisdom to get all things technically worked out on the computer to get his his card card in it and pass the test on the computer and he can get his guard renewal in august because that's how he can keep his job if not he said then god would supply him with another job in a different field so he explained that to me the other night if the card expires he can no longer work with that but he it would say take several hours of renewal and he had to get access to a computer and so let's just remember that in prayer for for him there and then remembering brother peter and his family as they travel they were leaving this morning they would fly up to seattle i believe and then in the morning continue the flight up up into alaska and he said they'd be spending about a month over there so he would still be working remotely online but they would get chimed to travel in all in brother matthew watkins had sent me a text saying that brother daryl ward had tested positive for the coronavirus on monday but had a very mild fever and a little shortness of breath and no no major symptoms so ask that we would keep him um keep him in prayer i texted him a while ago see if there was an update or anything but that i didn't get a response so trusting that all is well and then i spoke with brother ed dougal and as he let us know he would be traveling and working up in bullhead city area spoke with him uh monday morning and temperatures there were running 119 to in the low 120s he said it was quite miserable and they were supposed to get hotter this week so let's remember brother ed and the crews that are out there working and not only them but all those that are physically working outside in a time like this so and then we got a text and i'll read it an update on sister angela boyd and let me uh this was sent from her sister sister angela yarbro and says she says i just or her sister christie said i just got off the phone with roy which is sister angela's husband he said they woke her up today she moved her toes and her fingers and she was answering their questions when they flipped her over she's oxygenating at 98 percent which is wonderful that means her body is taking the ventilator oxygen and it is breathing for her but they're believing that by the end of the week or monday she'll be they'll be able to start weaning her off of that oxygen and she is improving according to what the nurse said so we appreciate god hearing and answering prayers so he never fails and he does things at his time you know it's sometimes we would want it done right now but he has a reason as to why and we just have to accept that and believe lord you know what's best for me you know the situation so we have a praise here um maybe i should let you read it to brother lyle you want me to read it okay he says from proverbs 3 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy known understanding and in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path it says when heather accepted my marriage proposal we were so poor that i had to borrow an engagement ring and return it after the ceremony you might counsel some young men that don't have some money there brother i'll i even had to borrow a suit for the wedding two years ago heather's mom passed away and she received her mother's engagement ring from the family it's a very special reminder to her of her parents and her love for each other so god took care of that part too amen we moved into a different house last december and all the confusion of the move the ring along with a how do you say that mezuzah we purchase in the jewish orthodox quarter of jerusalem 33 years ago and one other very special item they were misplaced many prayers and frantic searches occurred and by late february we just gave it all over to the lord and stopped looking today we were preparing some things to get ready for a road trip to washington to help our second oldest granddaughter celebrate her engagement while we were looking for a king heather noticed a tiny plastic bag pinned in a hard to see location on a cork notice board beneath the cabinet in the kitchen and she retrieved the bag and opened it and in it were all three items amen did you any hear any shout late this morning around tucson he says our god is mindful in the smallest things he just wants us to trust him so amen how many have a testimony that god is mindful god keeps god takes care i heard the testimony of brother ron spencer that brother pruitt gave the other day and also the testimony brother pruitt and proud giving on his wife again god being faithful god keeping his word so appreciate that so let's stand there's a few needs things to to be remembered here so you know and you say brother and we always raise our hands that's okay sometimes you just have to remind yourself you're not reminding him you just have to remind yourself so let's bow our heads lord we thank you lord we appreciate that even even as you spoke to my heart a little bit ago how you you willingly came down and took our place lord there were those that actually witnessed that crucifixion that day all that happened at calvary and the the striping and the the bruising and the bleeding and the crying out for my god my god why is dolphers they didn't understand it many ran many left they were so disappointed thinking that you were their salvation but it didn't look that way but then brother matt had us saying oh how i love him how i adore him because to us it has been made now lord of what you've done for us how every need is supplied how everything is met parted we thank you we've put prayer requests we've requested for these saints here brother brother petty and brother ward and sister angela and the hands that are raised lord and we can testify about brother ron spencer and sister pruitt's healing and our sister media testifying that god takes care and keeps and watches over his children brother johnson giving testimony of over the years how he could testify that god is the same yesterday today and forever but you did it for one reason you gave your whole life you shed your innocent blood lord for us who could not redeem or save ourselves but you took our place and we accept it and we love you for it and we thank you for it in jesus christ's name amen amen you appreciate the grace of god and his mercy amen thank you sisters god bless you while you're standing let's take just one scripture the first scripture brother jeremy of the ones i sent you i believe now we'll start with psalms chapter 8 and it's verses 1 through 9 but i'm just going to read verse 1 while we're standing and it says oh lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who has set thy glory above the heavens o lord our lord amen willingly submit to him your my lord how excellent is i name in all the earth who has set thy glory above the heavens amen you may be seated so this this afternoon as as i on monday and tuesday getting things together and and putting it together and then i opened up scripture of the day on my phone and scripture of the day was in psalms 119 and uh so i began to read it and i said my how that ties into this and brother matt said he never got to his thought really on sunday because sometimes there's just my cup runeth over you know you would like to be able to get it all out and and he did mention that sunday morning he would be streaming service here and we'd be having one service we got a text from my daughter nina this afternoon that kansas had has lifted the the um quarantine from those folks coming to kansas or the ones that have gone from kansas back so she says i can come and travel again she was supposed to have come a couple weeks ago and couldn't do that so god has it all under control you know we myself brother arne speaking of things that are going on in politics and we realize god sets god takes down you know each king each prophet each man that god used they couldn't tell you why we have the advantage to know by reading and see the end results but while they were going going through they couldn't always understand it but god has it in place here he has your life in order he has the things you're going through you say boy i made a mess out of it he was aware of it he wasn't like oh no man what did he do you know that's not him he says i've got as he gave that story of the prodigal son and the other son at home you know the son asked for his inheritance and he got it and he went and he wasted it you know and and he's looking down he said the same way i've given you an inheritance i've passed about he goes many have wasted it many have ruined their testimony but god gets the glory in it you know and and so we we got to understand that and so i was looking at this and i read it and i said oh my this this can be a whole sermon in itself so it's going to start that way and then we'll see where we go but taking a portion first off of um daily strength the prophet job said let us choose for ourselves what is right let us know among ourselves what is good that's something that job said we know what is right and what is good because we have the word of god and we have the voice of god ring it out through his spirit god has never left us with the way we can't know you know if if it was up to every man's individual idea the scripture does tell every man did what they thought was right in their own eyes you know but god has his word but even more and above that he has his spirit dwelling in you to interpret the word to you because we'd all do it differently we would all have different ideas so he says we have the word of god and we have the voice of god ringing out to us through his spirit there are consequences to choose god's path something hard and painful sometimes we'd love for it to just be a a path an easy path slightly downhill all the time easier to go but you know when you want to get to certain places to see some of the beauty there is a hard path to get there a hard climb to get there maybe several hours or several days or in the case to get to one of some of the tallest mountains it takes years of planning i was sitting in an office doing some paperwork and there was a picture on the hanging up behind the lady that was the office and it looked like a huge ocean wave and i said where's that picture from and she goes that's the colorado river i'm looking she goes and our raft is in the middle of that wave and all i saw was a huge wave but she lived through it so she knew it was there you know and she said it took many years or many uh other rivers rafted white water rafting before you were qualified to go down the colorado river and she explained it you know and so the many things you've gone through the many trials you've gone through have their purpose and they have their reason if we could look back down the pathway of our life i would say i would change this i would do this differently sometimes we ask each other me and my wife he said if you could do it over again what would you different do differently and we would look at some things maybe i would have been more careful here maybe i would have saved a little more money maybe you know the things we would have as you're looking back on it because they say hindsight is 20 20. you know but god had it ordained god had it planned and so here it is job says he says when he's speaking that we choose that but some are painful but it leads to joy and peace it leads to an expected end like jeremiah 29 11 says we have an expected end when we choose his way and we and we choose to do what is right and what is good choose right no matter the consequences because then we have that expected end there is a reward if i could put it that day there is uh something to achieve there is something to to to get to if you choose a way sometimes we take shortcuts i was walking with the girls up through pima canyon when they were young and it was water running down after end of winter into early spring and i chose i said you girls go around the pathway i'm going to go this way and i'll meet you on the other side so i thought i had gone far enough to meet them on the other side and there was naomi and elizabeth maybe sarah and so i'm standing there wondering where they're at and not paying attention next to them standing next to sorrow i just decided to lean on it and i found out real quick you don't lean on saguaros because they're pretty sticky you know if i stayed on the path it would have been a different result i pray god i learned a lesson i haven't tried it again but there is an expected end and then brother branham says now when you you can't bluff it you've got to have it you can't bluff it satan knows when you're bluffing he also knows when you've got it okay your heart condemns you not and you're you're a christian you have a right to every promise that god made in his book it's yours no matter what the consequence is and what the outcome you don't look to that you look to at the faith that god gave you that god gave you to the promise you take and apply it god said so there it stands and nothing will move it that's where you stand that's where you hold lord i can't see the end of this i don't see what's past the turn on the road but you told me to go so therefore i will go and i'll walk that way abraham leave all that you have and go begin to walk i'm going to take you to a land that's all going to be yours but he didn't tell abraham every step of the way he just said go abraham began to walk begin to travel the same as you and i have and still do now david says you know i'm going to tie this into psalms 119 where we read you know we we read out of out of psalms that script but i want to just get in psalms 119 and start here first psalms 1 and 19 we'll read it from verse 89 to verse 96 and and just speak a little bit here forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven there's no this way about it there's no that way about it there's nothing that rocks it shakes it moves it they don't settle it's settled it's firm it's eternal he sometimes i wonder how much david understood what he was writing or saying how much of it was under inspiration and how much of a david had learned by experience because there are things that we've read and heard but one day all said the revelation of it comes to your heart because now you've experienced it i'm the lord thy god that healeth all thy diseases and you say amen because you has healed mine he's done this for me it's not just words spoken anymore but something that goes with it thy faithfulness is unto all generations so i'm included with that it wasn't just to that first generation it still continues he says thou has established the earth and it abideth here david could see what he has seen with could i say this with a limited view they couldn't get up into the heavens and look down they couldn't go around the earth in a in a spaceship and take pictures of it they didn't have those things but he what he could see understood what you said still abides and you're faithful with it it says they continue this day according to thine ordinances for all are thy servants they're under his command they're under his keeping they're under his protection and i'm on there too but i have to willingly place myself in there i have to say i surrender i have to yield i have to realize lord i don't understand it but i trust you i've had enough experiences with you when i didn't understand and you told me to go and i went it worked out exactly like you said it should work out and i've learned that he says and he says the heavens and and the earth the ordinances as thou has appointed for all things are subject to thy power and to thy pleasure it's another way to look at that scripture what you desired for your own pleasure because he could he's the only one that can want something to do something and be totally right with the right attitude spirit to have it because we've got to be careful would check our motives and our spirits first for things we do sometimes i want this this and this and then god says why but he could do it because there is no wrong motive in him and then david says this in in verse 92 unless thy law had been my delights when something delights you when something attracts you when something you love you'll pay attention to it you'll give a lot to it if not your all you'll spend a lot you know there are some things that we like to do and some things we don't like to do and the things we like don't like to do we we we spend the least amount of time doing it now i'm not talking about work now we got to do that but there's just things that you know they have to be done um we all like what happens after the dishwasher's been loaded and everything's washed but somebody has to do the loading and not everybody likes to load a dishwasher i love to eat off the clean plates though that's the part i like best you know and he says unless the law had been my delights i have should have perished in mine afflictions david looked at himself and said and i had not known what the word of god says and he's faithful to keep it i would have died in all that i've i've been afflicted by or i have afflicted myself with brother branham says i am my own worst enemy. and if i wonder sometimes why all this happening i just have to look at myself sometimes rather than try to say what's causing it look at yourself closely he says he says or you know and i would i just this is something i said i thought when i read this if i did not have a revelation of a place prepared for me he says i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be there also if i didn't have that an understanding revelation in my heart that this is for a purpose he said the new body might theophany that's god's greatest desire not necessarily a heaven a literal place a mansion to walk in but for you to go back to how he saw you in the beginning with that eternal body that perfect body in that perfect as a son and daughter of god you go and read through and go through the message you see where brother branham is talking about all that's in a seed you'll see where he's talking when he says he goes to prepare a place for you and he talks about this being the old coat and putting on the new coat because heaven would be wonderful but if i go in this body that still hurts and everything i'm just not going to enjoy this much i'm going to be a million 298 000 years old and still aches and pains but there's something greater than that and then he said so i will never forget thy precepts so when i hear precepts i immediately think scriptures thy word so i just looked it up what is a precept a command or principle intended especially as a general rule of action david realized if i take your word and i put it to action and i live in that then i have victory then i have confidence he says for with them thou has quickened me or brought me to life you you know he says another word is an order issued by a by legally constituted authority to a subordinate official and i said amen i'm subordinate to him but i'm his son so my name on the checkbook is the same as his you can take all of god's word and you can have it he says it's another way david said i will ever keep your orders in mind those will be my thoughts paul says think on these things stay with the word brother brandon says don't get outside of the word of god what god has said stay with that for in them i have life you know you see these people say this is life this is life you see these commercials you see advertisements this is life this is life but they don't show you the effects of 30 40 50 years down the road of that life you know and then so he says i am thine save me for i have sought thy precepts i've diligently certainly they've been they've been my heart's desire um i was reading somebody's testimony and and i i don't remember exactly when i was reading it yesterday or the day before and brother they had prayed for a young man's eyes and the young man a young boy said began to read comic books and brother branham said don't read that you'll lose your healing that caught me right there god gave me a good set of eyes he healed my eyes and i go back to the same trash that i wasted it all david says i have sought thy precepts that's what i look for that's what i spent my time with i want to be quickened i want to have my part in the resurrection what should i be looking at what should i be feeding on what should i be thinking of and he says the wicked have waited for me to destroy me but i will consider thy testimonies and again i will i will insert here i am my greatest enemy i'm the one i struggle with the most it's not my brother it's not my sister sometimes we get to looking around that way this one caused me this one this one did that this but this is a guy that i have to deal with mostly and he says so so he says they're gonna destroy and then i looked at i have thy testimonies and when i thought of that word that the the the things that we've heard about him but this also means a a sworn statement a statement a declaration in other words thy testimony is what you have said in your word and you keep it and then we can testify of it our lives testified our words testified how we act testify about it or as the scripture says your conversation testify about what he has said he's then he said this and this is what caught my attention also he says i have seen an end of all perfection and that stopped me and i you know i said i've seen the end of all perfection david got to the point where he saw it i looked i said no when you look at what david was saying he said i've seen everything around me and nothing comes to perfection everything has that end everything has a failure in everything that i've done in you know i i was talking with brother matt about this and we were just sharing a little bit and we've come to a place we've seen what should have been accomplished it didn't you know what other people had in mind what what this government wanted to do what this king wanted to do or what this pastor or this minister or try to do we've seen it come apart we've seen it fall apart that's why david said but thy commandment is exceeding broad so i know that the scripture says straight is the gate so i looked that up and i said thy commandments are eternal they're forever they don't stop they continue they don't end in incompleteness they don't end in in in a grave they are life that's a whole message in itself that was that one portion of psalms 119. david is saying this now i wonder sometimes how many times david didn't even realize what he was writing what he was saying how much of it was prophetic you know because david was like you and i he got up in the morning sometimes very tired had a headache unmotivated do we have to do another day like this but then he himself would go back i have to go back to the word of god i have to go back to what you said lord and then go that way i'll be with you even in you unto the end of the world i'll take that god you know this this world is not my home we sang that one i'll take that lord because i'm looking for that other one i trust that that was a blessing to you and then as it was a blessing to me this this afternoon just reading that and going through that so let's read a couple of quotes here and from a greater than solomon is here now solomon is considered the wisest man on earth david was a man listed as a man after god's own heart a man that who failed quite often the bible records a lot of it but who knows how many other things weren't recorded but it said solomon was it was a wise man he said help me lord to rule thy people in a right spirit but a greater than solomon is here now what a title huh greater than solomon the one who gave solomon the wisdom he had is here now and now we find that the antichrist in the last day will deceive all that dwells upon the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world your name was put in god's book before the lamb was slain god had already seen that he made sure it was there when his program was laid out the whole thing you were recognized in that program because you got eternal life the word eternal never did begin neither can it end and you are an attribute of god's thinking before the world was when he was on the cross you were on his mind he saw a time he didn't we would look at it as a on a time limit when when when but he saw it out whenever it was he said this will come to pass before the world was eve ever created that's only that's the only way you can have eternal life and that life that he was thinking of you is in you now there is a there is no way to separate it it's in there to stay so let me tell you this you can't lose it first of all you didn't buy it it was given to you and he said all that i have all whose names are i will not lose a single one of them so you can stand on what god has said that's his word now things that are to be the next quote i believe it is things that are to be look at the leaves come on the trees it's because brother branham was living in a place that had a lot of trees with leaves it comes up a good fine leaf brings out shade puts out its fruit next the first thing you know autumn comes strikes it death runs right down into the root into the ground again is that the end of it next spring she comes right back up to testify oh that's perpetual life but a tree has its final and it's there's some year trees that have are hundreds and hundreds of years old but they'll come a time when their life is gone so that's perpetual life he says but brother sister we got eternal life we've got eternal life to the great one who came has gone is able to pray prepare us a body and these growing pains we feel like you women feel a condemned of what you do you men that that hangs on to seminary doctrines and so forth you all want to i recite this creed i do this and and don't put that too far away because it happens right amongst us too but there's something right down in you when you see the eyes of the blind open when when god begins to unveil how does god unveil himself he said these signs shall follow them that belief this is what you're looking you're going to see a god in action and that's how he identifies himself the deaf under the blind all these things that's promised see the word preached in its power see a prostitute off the street made a lady see a drunkard come out of there and and become a real saint of god my see that's something life in there and you begin to feel well maybe i ought to do that but see what it what it is it's something your body wandering is is needing there's a call there's a draw i don't want to live in this guy any longer than i have to because there's something out there when there's a deep call there's a deep to respond when there's something tugging in your heart i feel the pull brother green used to say if there if there's if there's a place of of uh uh what's the word i'm not i want to say condemnation but no it's uh when god is speaking to your heart and trying to get your attention you know and he speaks to you it doesn't condemn you it causes you concern to to make it right satan loves to whisper in your ear and tell you you're condemned you're no good you're this that's the way he talks to you but god loves to convict your heart reach down and say hey let's do this different let's turn it let's not be that way he says he says so maybe i not to do that but what is it it's something your body under isn't it is needing come on but god's got the vitamins right in here for every bit of the body jesus has gone to prepare the place in the bosom of god yes sir a little germ son of god little son or daughter of god jesus only asked for one thing in his prayer to the father you know what that was one thing after all of his sacrifice that he did here on earth the life that he lived the path that he walked he asked for one thing that where i am there there may be also he asked for our fellowship that's the only thing he asked the father in the prayer your companionship forever now there's only one way to hand you had to be part of him in the first place and if you're desiring it shows what you have there you know if you want to read this in saint john he said the 24th then how much should we desire him if if he desired now listen if you were really born of the spirit of god that means everything to you see it ain't some books of rules you don't have to live you don't live by laws and so forth you live by the grace of god in the spirit of god well i was in prayer there just before the service again i was thinking lord i was just appreciating his sacrifice what he did going to that cross willingly go and there were those that witnessed it those that saw it and there was those that ran from it because they thought it was a failure there was a few that stayed close by but most of them walked away from it not understanding it and and the scripture tells us as he's walking down the they're walking through emmaus and he comes up close by him and he listens to their conversation a bit and he says what are you what are you boys talking about and they said well where have you been don't you know what just took place the one we thought was going to be our salvation was going to take it's going to redeem us was going to change he died and and we've lost our hope we're just going back to what we used to do and and you know god could have said well you're unbelievers i'll go try to find somebody else but they had representation they had something in their heart and god had to just go down and prick it a little bit just like he does it for you every once in a while he goes down and he turns it up and he turns it a little bit he says and you realize that's god speaking that's god drawing and he tells them oh slow of heart o fools he calls him you know what he was telling me guys do you guys don't believe god is alive a fool says there is no god they had gotten to that point he died and he calls him on it but he didn't tell him they were going to hell for that he began to expound he began to talk he began said this is what the scripture said this is this is this prophecy this is what david said this was what and then he just as he's a gentleman brother brahm said he's a gentleman he could have reached over and bought both of their heads together to get their attention but he's a gentleman and he talked to them and then he acted like he was going to go on and sometimes i think he does that to us so that we will call out and cry out to him no don't go and they turn around stay here with us that's what he had planned to do all along and then he reveals himself dead not our hearts burnt within us amen by the grace of god israel in the church number two now brother binge has been made fun of and persecuted and pushed back and everything one of these glorious mornings hallelujah the great master who stands in glory pointing out his servants not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord not by theology and not by grammar not by these other things but by simple holy unadulterated faith in the son of god and what he said in his word he's painting a picture he's painting the picture what is it a holy ghost-filled church that he'll for ordain before the beginning of the world to appear yonder in his glory and some of these mornings he'll sweep down from the heaven hallelujah like a great magnet he'll pick up the little church that's been persecuted hang her yonder in the hall of fame when she goes through the sky shouting this robe of flesh will drop and rise and sees that everlasting price shout while passing through the air farewell farewell sweet hour prayer amen all for that day you know and we've shared a little bit of of this brother that had sent out a few things to myself and brother matt and the he his barber was giving him a haircut and i i know his barber really well because he's my dad my dad cuts a brother's hair so the brother began to tell my dad some of these things and my dad is pretty blunt on his answer sometimes um i don't mean to embarrass him or i probably won't i might get in trouble though but my dad would be there and you know we're just kids learning and my dad did the concrete work and construction and and he would tell us nicely to help him he would say don't be afraid of the shovel it won't bite you pick it up and start working that's what dad used to say to us and sometimes i would get a little rough with the girls and my wife would say don't be like your dad please but it's okay dad loved us that's just how he did it but you know so so the brother was sharing with my dad you know how he felt and the rapture was spiritual so dad just answered complaining he said you can stay here brother but i'm going home with him pretty simple answer hey this world's not my home i'm just a passing through farewell farewell sweet hour prayer and then the last one conflict between god and satan but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's an infinite god now seeing that there was going to be a conflict so he knew there would be a conflict he knew there would be war he knew there would be battle he said there was going to be a battle god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition right kind of attack the right kind of everything they had need of that would sweep them all the way from eden to the rapture what was it the word the word that's what defeat satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing that there is the word because it never fails david said it's perpetual it's still doing everything you told this earth this creation do it's still doing it because it doesn't fail and i appreciate that an unfailing god who keeps his word so let's go back to psalms 8 1-9 and this is david's words here oh lord our lord how excellent or how majestic how noble is thy name and all the earth who has set thy glory above the heavens then he says out of the mouth of babes and sucklings has thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou might is still the enemy in the avenger he says you have made clear your strength even out of the mouth of babes at the breast because of those who are against you that you may put to shame the cruel and violent man god will do things in simplicity in such a simple way that you would look and say why and then he could say i can do with this simple thing what man has tried for years and has not accomplished i can do it this simple way and you can trust him for it you can believe him for it he says then david says when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which al has ordained i've got up on the roof of our house and and before they put the street lamps up and it was pretty dark out where we were at and i would lay when they were supposed to have a meteor shower you could just lay there and watch them go by see the work that god has said the things that we're going just the beauty of it all he says i see the work of thy fingers the moon the stars which thou has ordained and i think what is man when i see that that glory down from his glory the splendor and all i think what am i what is man he says that thou art mindful of him and the sons of man whom thou vist him david says what what in me causes you to come down and visit with me when you have all this prayer splendor this royalty this greatness i'm nothing in it is how dave is looking at himself right there he says thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned them with glory and honor but if you look at a lot of and even what brother branham said in the interview thou has made him a little over the god brother brahman said he made him a son of god and if you're a son of god you're part of god and if you're a daughter of god you're part of god he said the angels are going to stand there they're not going to be they don't understand this redemption they don't understand all this because they never fell they've never suffered the pain the sickness the disappointments and he says but you've made him that way and david realizes thou made us him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou has put all things under his feet david is speaking of the man that god made he says all sheep all oxygenate and the beast of the field the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever pass it through the paths of the sea and it just made me think the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god let me say it to you all they're waiting on you they're waiting on me but god knows we are getting there we're getting to that place and then he says oh lord our lord how excellent is i name in all the earth that's the name that cannot be defiled that's a name that nothing bad can be said about you know you might you might somebody might know me say brother aaron's really fine man somebody else might say yeah but i had problems with him same guy depends whose opinion it is but god there's only one opinion that matters he's perfect he's excellent he never fails romans 8 11 maybe we'll get into a little bit more of the subject here but if the same spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you quicken to make to live another definition is to take from the dead and bring it alive we thought we were living we thought we were doing great but we were dead we were dead in sins paul said we had no idea we thought we were having a great life until god got a hold you realize that wasn't a great life that was leading me straight what the wages of sin you know but the gift of god is eternal but paul says with that same spirit that raised christ from the dead it will quicken you when that trump shall sound in the in the dead in christ are risen you don't have to get be embarrassed you don't have to say where's my you have that same spirit in you some shall not see death but we shall be changed romans 6 1-9 paul gets into this a little bit here what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound no i i heard a brother say that one time he said something and i said well be careful brother it doesn't take long if you're you can take and make grace into a disgrace and he says i'm tired of hearing that he says i hate it when ministers speak that way he said grace is grace no matter what you do they graded me a little bit you know i know if if i did something wrong my wife would still love me because she's done it when i've done something wrong she's proved she would when i failed her wait a minute but if i really love her and accept the grace of her love i would do as as little as possible to make her upset to make her because of that but if i do make a mistake she would say i forgive you brother branham talked about that when he was getting ready to leave he knew travel overseas and he would say now what if i would tell sister branham i'm leaving and if i hear you were flirting with another man you're a divorced woman and she would what kind of fellowship kind of uh uh what would that be under living under a fear living under an ugly spirit he said so shall we live in sin because there is grace he said no god forbid he said how shall we that our dead to sin live any longer therein he says know ye not that so many of us were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death brother brahm says i was in him i was part of him when he was crucified and when he was resurrected you had representation in him there therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in the newness of life now we know baptism getting baptized up here wherever he was it's just an outward representation of what god has done in your life the church that we used to go on believed that when you went into the water and came out that cleansed you that's how they interpret it and we heard brother branham say you went in a a a dry center you came out a wet center because the water didn't clean you it took the blood of jesus christ it took you confessing it but that was a representation that you are willing to admit to the world of lodge i have accepted his death and is burial's resurrection in my place that's what paul's telling us here for if we have been planted together in his likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection because he lives he has risen you know so so we're we're here going lord you know uh i i know there's a resurrection there's something in my heart there's a deep calling so there's a deep response there's something that's drawing me that way knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin may be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin does it draw on you does it pull on yes you still have that flesh on you but you cannot serve two masters you serve god and because he is god and he is full of mercy when you do make a mistake you in turn ask him for forgiveness and he'll give it to you and not only that but gives you a peace and an assurance with it he doesn't say okay now you've got to do x amount of this and x amount of that to deserve it i remember talking with brother mark mcfadden one day and he was talking about an uncle that had passed away and they would go back and they would ask the priest so at what stage is uncle and he would say oh not too sure but if you say this this many more hail marys and if you give us this much more money we'll get them up a little higher well at that rate why let them go you can make yourself rich that way that's that's man's way but god rich in mercy for once and for all amen for he that is dead is free from sin paul says let's continue on there now if we'd be dead in christ with christ we believe that we also shall live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death has no more dominion over him so if it's christ in you death has no more dominion over you right if that same spirit that would raise christ from the dead it would raise you also amen let's finish the last few scriptures here on this i guess that was the last one there on verse 9. and then let's go to saint luke i was looking at the wrong one on top i saw the 11 from the previous scripture luke chapter 20 verses 35-38 he says but they which will shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead he says neither mary nor given in marriage now he is speaking to the men that said whose wife is is she going to be on that side he says but now he takes into this he says oh there's not going to be any of that over there he said neither can they die anymore for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection if you're a child of god you're a child of the resurrection because you're part of him next two verses 37 38 i believe now that the dead are raised even moses showed at the bush when he called the lord the lord the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him i'm calling out to the god of jacob to the god of isaac to the god of abraham to the god of my father to the god of my mother to the god of my brother to the god of my sister all part of the family of god i was listening as brother branham finishes up the message things that are to be and he's standing over the crowd he says now stand the heels and each one of you place your hands he says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover your brother your sister in christ he said it's yours it's yours and i understand sometimes you know there's a a brother that has a gift and there's a ministry and all and and he can bless us with it but what if he's on the other side of the world and you have a christian person right next to you who has the same spirit the spirit of christ you can have what you ask for he's not the god of the dead but a god of the living and all live unto him and remember we had read in romans 8 6 last week he says romans 8 6. or maybe i gave you the wrong one it's one we had read last week but to unto but to us there is but one god you know i think it's corinthians 8 6 i did that let's do first corinthians 8 6. i i wrote it down wrong here and i didn't ask her to help me check it i checked it myself so i can't blame right on this one i do it every once in a while i write down the one the scripture that i'm reading but it's not the one i'm referring to so but unto us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him all in him controlled by him bought by him loved by him the life of him that's all we don't we don't do this on our own at all it's through him saint john 11 25 and 26. this is when jesus is there after lazarus has passed away and and martha and mary are there and and and he tells the he she tells i know that he'll live in the resurrection they had that promise they had that thing but he says jesus says unto her i am the resurrection he had not died yet he had not resurrected yet this wasn't after the crucifix was before i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live in the spiritual sense and in lazarus in the physical sense nothing is impossible for god and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this and he is speaking of what never dying the same when brother branham says after he crossed into the other the other side he says i'm not afraid of death death is just that carrier to get me from this life to that life you know it's not how far down is he in in in in you know in in is the catholic doctrine you know in purgatory well we'll get him up a little bit we'll take him down we'll do this we'll do that we'll play with a man's life as long as you got the finances to play with us but god says no it's settled it's done already first corinthians chapter 15. we'll do verses 13 to 26. again paul deals with it but if there is no resurrection of the dead then christ is not risen and this religion is in vain it's like any other religion might as well as be a buddha might as well be something else hey find something else that you like better if christ hasn't written what appeals to you better but he said there is no resurrection of dead then christ has not risen and if christ be not risen then our preaching is in vain and your faith also is in vain comes to no end paul says that yea we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raise up christ whom he raised whom he raised not up if it be that the dead not raise not paul puts it pretty plain there excuse me for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is in vain now isn't that the same scream church again he said but if christ be not raised your faith is in vain and you are yet in your sins and the wages of sin is death then they which are also are falling asleep in christ are perish we have no hope but let me tell you one we just heard last week who crossed over and lord allowed him to go on to the other side and those who had passed on they weren't just a wisp in the clouds they weren't just a thought they were alive they were real and he says for if in this life only we have hope in christ then we are of all men most miserable let's go on but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits and afterward they that are christ at his comings paul said there's an order for this and because everything else god has has ordained and has come to pass and david said how magnificent how wonderful everything does exactly you say so will this it's still the word of god and it's eternal then cometh the end and he shall have delivered up the kingdom of god even the father when he shall have put down all the rule and all the authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all the enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death amen amen what a promise we have in god what a future we have in god but what i like now is we can have some taste of it now don't have to wait till after you're dead there's something in you that responds or something things that god does a healing something that he does is it's real it's alive and then we'll read 54 and 55 as paul finishes so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shaft put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is i staying o grave where is i victory job sat there and he looked and he said i see the flower it comes up in spring and then in summer it goes and then fall comes around and it disappears but i see it again next spring my wife has put some seed out there in front and and it grows up and it's uh you know either in the spring or the winter for us and then and then it disappears it gets dry and everything like that but let the rains fall in the springtime come around and they begin to blossom again and that job said that's what i see but i've seen many a men put in their grave and i haven't seen one come back up but something in job cries out that representation of god he said i know my redeemer liveth and with these eyes i shall behold him i have the same promise you have that same promise you know some of you younger ones are thinking well i've still got a lot of time to go brother brother arne was asking me he said so when did you guys move here i said in 1976 and i was 16 years old and 60 would never come but it's here but you know what i still have that same promise and it's closer now than it's ever been before and when you get into his presence and he comes around you you get a taste of it you begin to see when how he visits you and minister you watch somebody receive their healing a change in life a sinner become a saint like brother braham said a prostitute become a a sweet christian lady and you realize that's that's evidence of this eternal life he says oh death where is i sting o grave where is thy victory amen is that the truth is that the truth in your life can you stand in the face of death and says oh grave where is thy victory oh death whereas i sting i've stepped from this life into the next life no more sorrow no more crying no more pain no more all i can use is words to try to explain it and i'll say to you the same way brother brown said don't miss it don't miss it make sure your reservation is stamped make sure that everything is taken care of check your own life look at it closely and say god remind me bring it to pass in my life that when there's a deep calling there's a deep response a desire for you let us bury it lord we thank you you are the resurrection you are the life it's not a formula it's not if you study this so many messages if you pray this long if you give so much in offerings if you attend so many services if if you give it your biggest best effort or if you seclude yourself and and and become a monk to a religion it has nothing to do with that lord it's all in christ being in you living in you and and you said our names are written in the lamb's book of life therefore it's eternal life lord we thank you for it and lord we want to show our appreciation and our love back to you by saying be it unto me according to thy word let being recipients lord and letting it come and live in us today lord father for we know lord if this earthly tabernacle would perish and go away we have another one waiting a heavenly one not made with hands lord the one that you said father that there where i am they would be there with me lord and we thank you for it today and we love you for it in jesus christ's day amen you love him is he the same yesterday today today for you too knowing that the same god of yesterday is still with you dave will still be with you tomorrow he never leaves you never if i say let me see something here okay just my father mentioned this but a sister that used to attend the church here sister reynolds she passed away from kovitz so let's remember them part of the family used to sit up sit up uh up in the balcony some years ago so sister reynolds has gone on to be with the lord dad said she was about 73 years old i still remember the family would sit up there so let's just bow our heads and just ask lord this text just sent to me about sister reynolds passing away now there's that hope that lied within her that i mean lord it's she's just stepped from this life into the other but there are those that have stayed on this side her her daughter's your son and the family lord and they'll miss mom lord i trust that the same hope that was in mom is in them that same life lord and they know that soon and very soon lord they'll be together again so comfort and strengthen them lord in this hour we pray in jesus christ's name amen let's stand amen i am redeemed bought with a price jesus has

frustrated go back to the word of god remind yourself of jeremiah 29 11 i know the thoughts that i have towards you i know that expected end that i have for you just a little bit longer just one more
