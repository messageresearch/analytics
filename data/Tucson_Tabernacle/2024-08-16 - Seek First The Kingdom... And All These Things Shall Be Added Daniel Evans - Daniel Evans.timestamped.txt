[26:46] Josiah in the back and thought this
[26:50] Psalm is perfect for the message I want
[26:51] to bring this
[26:52] morning Psalm chapter
[26:56] 1 blessed is the man
[26:59] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[27:02] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[27:04] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[27:08] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[27:10] of the Lord and in in his law that he
[27:15] meditate day and
[27:16] night and he shall be like a tree
[27:19] planted by the riv rivers of water that
[27:21] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[27:25] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[27:28] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper what

[29:21] Japan and Hawaii and all over the place
[29:23] it's good to have you back my friend God
[29:25] bless
[29:26] you Stephanie and I were we're driving
[29:29] to church this morning and um it's
[29:32] really neat because she wanted to teach
[29:34] on the Beatitudes in her Sunday school
[29:37] class and um she asked me she said um
[29:40] there was one of them she didn't
[29:42] understand and she said it was blessed
[29:45] are the poor in
[29:46] spirit and she said what does that
[29:49] mean and I said you know what I don't
[29:52] know I said look at a couple of the
[29:54] other translations and and see if you
[29:56] can get it well so she gets on on her
[29:58] phone and she types it
[30:01] in and uh right away it comes up what it
[30:06] means and I'm driving I look
[30:09] over and that's not the
[30:13] Bible that was
[30:16] AI generated
[30:19] answer so she she types it in and these
[30:22] this it scrubs the internet and it it
[30:25] generates an answer from everything it's
[30:28] written and it's not even a human being
[30:31] that wrote this thing it's something
[30:33] that's not it's not real it's a
[30:36] machine and it makes it to where now
[30:38] it's like this artificial intelligence
[30:41] is better than even a
[30:43] preacher it's better than anything and
[30:47] it can give you an answer to whatever
[30:50] question you have and as I was thinking
[30:53] about that and going along and I was
[30:55] like honey turn that thing off just
[30:58] read read the
[31:00] Bible and she's like well it's it's it's
[31:02] a good answer I said yeah it sounds
[31:05] good but this this isn't even this is
[31:08] not even a living breathing
[31:11] organism it's it's fake it's it's a
[31:15] computer and you I was just thinking on
[31:19] that and that's the way that the enemy
[31:21] does the enemy wants to take the Holy
[31:26] Spirit out of the Church to take each
[31:30] one of us have a each one of us have a
[31:32] role in this divine plan of God and what
[31:36] the enemy does it's like no I'm going to
[31:38] take that out I'm just going to make it
[31:39] easy on you just so you can search the
[31:42] internet and I'll I'll make a machine
[31:45] that can give you the answer and it's
[31:47] almost always a better answer than a
[31:50] person could give you and I'll just give
[31:52] it to you right here really easy and
[31:55] it's pulling out the gifts out of the
[32:00] church and replacing them with something
[32:02] else and it makes for a lazy
[32:05] generation it makes to where we just we
[32:07] have all the knowledge we need we have
[32:11] everything that we have is right here in
[32:14] the little square Idol what I call it I
[32:17] mean it's more rectangular than it is
[32:19] square but you know
[32:21] it's it's it's a plan of the
[32:24] enemy and it's like I said it's to take
[32:27] that relationship that all of us have
[32:30] with God to take that out and replace it
[32:33] with something else
[32:34] wow I was driving home week or two ago
[32:39] from
[32:41] Flagstaff and uh I listening to um the
[32:46] Bible and Book of Matthew and I got to
[32:49] Matthew Chapter 5 and Matthew Chapter 5
[32:52] is the start of The Sermon on the Mount
[32:55] most famous sermon that brother that the
[32:58] Lord Jesus preached just a I mean a
[33:04] masterpiece and as I was listening going
[33:06] down the
[33:08] mountain I was just taking in this
[33:11] wisdom and I I was I was saying Lord How
[33:14] could a man speak with such words how
[33:16] could a man speak with such wisdom as
[33:18] the Lord Jesus taught and and one thing
[33:21] after the other when it went through the
[33:24] Beatitudes and it and then he he goes
[33:26] and he he Contin continues his
[33:29] sermon and out loud I was saying Lord
[33:32] who could say such
[33:34] words he's saying things like you are
[33:37] the salt of the
[33:39] earth but if a salt has lost its flavor
[33:43] then what good is
[33:45] it it's the same thing brother James
[33:47] taking
[33:48] out the Holy Spirit out of the church
[33:51] and just replacing it with a machine or
[33:56] phone he says you are the light of the
[33:58] world he said but don't hide your light
[34:01] under something he said let your light
[34:03] shine among
[34:06] men he said that and then he warns the
[34:09] people he says I've not
[34:12] come the Lord Jesus the Messiah God in
[34:15] flesh he says I haven't come to do away
[34:17] with the law and the prophets he said I
[34:20] came to fulfill what they taught and
[34:24] he's warning the crowd he's like you're
[34:26] going to hear something that might not
[34:28] be what you've grown up
[34:30] with he's warning the crowd that it
[34:34] might not be your way of
[34:36] thinking then he goes on and he starts
[34:39] talking about this law and he says
[34:43] you've heard it Tau that you shall not
[34:45] murder he said
[34:48] but and if you murder you're liable to
[34:51] judgment but he says this he says but if
[34:53] you're angry with your brother you're
[34:56] liable to judgment
[34:58] taking the Commandments The Ten
[35:00] Commandments and now he's making them
[35:03] real in people he says this he says you
[35:07] have heard that you shall love your
[35:08] brother and you shall hate your enemy he
[35:12] said but I say to you love your enemies
[35:14] and pray for those that persecute
[35:18] you so your F so you that this is very
[35:22] important pray for those that persecute
[35:24] you so that you may be sons of your
[35:26] father who is in heaven
[35:28] for he makes his son to rise on the evil
[35:31] and on the good and send Reigns sends
[35:33] rain on the just and the unjust for if
[35:36] you love those who love you what reward
[35:38] do you have I ask us in this
[35:41] congregation if you love that those that
[35:43] love you what reward do you
[35:47] have and because and then he says but
[35:50] the Sinners and the tax collectors they
[35:52] do the same thing he says and if you
[35:54] greet only your brothers
[35:58] what more are you doing than other
[36:01] people if you're just greeting those
[36:03] that believe like you if you're just
[36:05] greeting your your brethren that are
[36:08] part of your group then what good as
[36:11] Jesus said what good are
[36:12] you he says don't even the Gentiles the
[36:17] unbelievers don't they even do the same
[36:20] thing he said you must therefore be
[36:24] perfect as your father which is in
[36:26] heaven is perfect
[36:28] so how can we be perfect he and and as
[36:31] he's as he's ministering there and he
[36:35] has this big
[36:36] crowd out in the field in the grass it
[36:39] says that they were they were sitting
[36:41] there and and as he's
[36:43] ministering he starts to change
[36:46] direction from these Commandments in the
[36:50] law and it's such a sweet thing as I was
[36:54] going down the mountain I was like Lord
[36:58] you're so kind you're so sweet in the
[37:02] way that you are and he's looking out on
[37:05] the people and he must have started to
[37:07] feel their
[37:09] anxiety he must have started to feel
[37:11] that that these people are are
[37:13] struggling with themes every one of them
[37:15] is struggling with things at home
[37:17] they're struggling with their jobs
[37:19] they're struggling with their family
[37:20] they're struggling with their kids with
[37:23] their moms and their dads they're
[37:24] they're they're having problems and then
[37:26] the Lord in his kindness and his love he
[37:29] looks
[37:30] out and maybe and I can't speak for God
[37:34] but it seems like
[37:36] maybe he felt that from the
[37:41] people
[37:43] and
[37:45] then he he starts to move as I said he
[37:48] starts to change directions of the
[37:51] church I mean of of his sermon
[37:54] and the Lord Jesus the Bible says that
[37:58] he's a high
[37:59] priest that's able to be touched by the
[38:03] feelings of our infirmities he
[38:06] understands how it is he understands how
[38:08] it is to suffer he understands all of
[38:11] the sins that are out there he
[38:15] understands the Temptation for all of
[38:16] them all of us have different
[38:19] Temptations and all of us have different
[38:21] weaknesses I may be able to relate with
[38:24] brother Aaron's weaknesses but I might
[38:26] not be able to relate with brother
[38:28] Josiah's weaknesses that's why God has
[38:30] placed in this church different people
[38:34] with different experiences and different
[38:37] gifts to bring because I can't if
[38:39] brother Josiah as I said if I don't
[38:41] understand I can't counsel I can't
[38:43] encourage brother Josiah like someone
[38:45] else that maybe has gone through what
[38:47] he's going through and vice versa but
[38:50] the Lord Jesus was
[38:52] different he understood all of The
[38:55] Temptations
[38:57] and the enemy knew who he was and the
[39:00] enemy hit him with every Temptation
[39:02] that's on the earth so he is that high
[39:05] priest he understands he understands how
[39:09] it feels for somebody to have a weakness
[39:11] with addiction he understands how it
[39:14] feels for somebody to have a weakness
[39:16] with sexual immorality he understands
[39:19] all of those things while some of us
[39:21] might not understand it but he
[39:23] understood it and that's why Brothers s
[39:27] it's so as I just said we can't take
[39:30] those gifts out of the church we need
[39:33] the people here not for
[39:38] yourself everybody thinks going to
[39:40] church I'm going to go to church because
[39:41] I want to get
[39:42] something I say it a lot go to church to
[39:45] give
[39:47] something go to church to give out your
[39:50] love wow I just saw the garas back there
[39:53] brother and sister Gara God bless you
[39:55] welcome to
[39:59] patriarch it's good to have you in
[40:01] [Applause]
[40:03] service come to give and then we receive
[40:07] as we
[40:08] give so he looked at Jesus he he looked
[40:12] out on this audience
[40:16] feeling their their anxiety there was a
[40:19] on Wednesday night there's a woman that
[40:21] came um sister Missy is she here that
[40:24] that lady that you witnessed to um um
[40:27] the lady that you witnessed to that was
[40:29] talking uh her name
[40:32] was
[40:33] an she came and just a hard life elderly
[40:39] sister struggling and has has I mean
[40:43] struggling with a place to to sleep at
[40:45] night going from shelter to shelter and
[40:47] just not having anything and she she
[40:51] comes and brother Jordan and I were
[40:53] talking with her and she was just
[40:56] destitute and and I said are you a
[40:58] Christian she said well I don't really
[40:59] know what it
[41:00] means and I said let me tell you a
[41:04] scripture and and I quoted to her the
[41:07] Lord
[41:08] Jesus
[41:11] saying um come unto
[41:15] me all ye that are burdened and heavy
[41:19] laden and I will give you rest and she
[41:23] looked at
[41:24] me and she said I like that she said say
[41:29] it
[41:31] again and and I simplified it a little
[41:34] bit and I said come unto me all you that
[41:39] are carrying a heavy burden and I will
[41:42] give you rest I said that's what Jesus
[41:45] does and she said tell me again and it
[41:51] was three or four times that I repeated
[41:53] it and she said oh I like that I said
[41:55] sister I said there's a whole book book
[41:58] of quotes like that I said and and every
[42:01] one of them is just as good as that one
[42:04] it's really really blessing
[42:07] her but there's something that we have
[42:12] to do also let's turn to Matthew chapter
[42:15] 6 now again Jesus is on the
[42:19] mountain and he's giving this sermon on
[42:23] the mountain and as I said precious
[42:25] words like no man had ever spoken is
[42:29] what Jesus is is preaching
[42:32] here Matthew 6:
[42:36] 25 and he felt as I said he must have
[42:39] felt the anxiety that was in the people
[42:43] and he says this he says therefore I say
[42:46] unto you take no thought for your life
[42:49] what you shall eat or what you shall
[42:51] drink nor yet for your body what you
[42:54] shall put on is not the light life more
[42:57] than meat and the body than rainment so
[43:01] he's saying he's saying you're wor worth
[43:03] a lot more than the clothes that you
[43:05] have on your life is worth a lot more
[43:08] than the food that you're you're
[43:09] Desiring to have and God knows it and he
[43:12] says and he continues on he says behold
[43:14] the fowls of the air for they sow not
[43:17] neither do they reap nor they gather
[43:19] into the barns yet your heavenly father
[43:22] feeds
[43:24] them are you not much better than that
[43:29] imagine the people listening to this and
[43:32] the struggles that they were having at
[43:34] home and he goes on and he says he says
[43:36] which of You by taking thought can add
[43:39] one cubit to a statue the ESV says which
[43:41] of you by being anxious can add a single
[43:45] hour to his
[43:47] life he says you're worrying about
[43:49] anxiety and you that worry isn't going
[43:51] to change
[43:53] anything wow and why take ye thought for
[43:57] reignment for your clothes consider the
[43:59] lies of the
[44:01] field how they grow they toil not
[44:04] they're not working and that they don't
[44:07] Spin and yet I say unto you that even
[44:10] Solomon in all his glory was not AR raay
[44:13] like one of these so he's saying even
[44:14] the most prosperous King that had ever
[44:16] lived can't even compare to this one
[44:19] little beautiful
[44:21] flower in all of man's achievements he
[44:23] can never make something as beautiful as
[44:27] God's simplest achievements wow and
[44:30] these lilies they show up every year you
[44:32] can count on them being there you can
[44:35] count
[44:36] on sister
[44:38] uh sister Rebecca back back there you
[44:41] can count on the spring flowers coming
[44:45] up in Ohio and in Indiana you know that
[44:49] they're going to be
[44:50] there they they're going to show
[44:54] up and yet nobody's worrying about them
[45:01] the sun rises every
[45:03] morning no matter if we worry about it
[45:05] coming up or not it's going to be there
[45:08] whether I'm depressed whether I'm
[45:09] looking for a job whether I don't know
[45:11] how I'm going to pay my bills that light
[45:13] spreads across the Earth no matter how
[45:15] much my tiny problems are I've gave the
[45:18] testimony before as I was really
[45:21] struggling with things I was I was
[45:23] really sad and depressed and I didn't
[45:26] know what direction my life was going
[45:27] just a few years ago and I go up on an
[45:30] elk hunting trip in northern Arizona and
[45:32] I'm up there and and we come back after
[45:35] dark and we come back to the UTV and we
[45:38] turn out our lights and I looked up in
[45:41] the sky there was no moon no clouds just
[45:45] these beautiful
[45:46] stars you could see the Milky Way up
[45:49] there all the different colors and the
[45:50] Stars went all the way down to the
[45:53] ground most beautiful thing one of the
[45:55] most beautiful things I could ever even
[45:57] imagine and I'm looking up there and I'm
[46:00] thinking Lord every one of
[46:03] those those heavenly bodies up there is
[46:05] bigger than the rock that I'm standing
[46:07] on and you created everyone and I'm
[46:08] worried about my
[46:10] problems thinking that maybe you're not
[46:12] hearing me no he knows if he can create
[46:16] all of this then he can surely provide
[46:20] for us verse 30 wherefore if God so
[46:23] clothed the grass of the field which
[46:26] today is and tomorrow is cast into the
[46:28] oven shall he not not not much more
[46:31] clothe you oh you have little faith
[46:34] therefore take no thought saying what
[46:37] shall we eat or what shall we
[46:39] drink or wherewith All Shall we be
[46:42] clothed he's saying that's up to God to
[46:45] do those things so don't worry about how
[46:46] you're going to pay the bills if a car
[46:48] breaks down you're G to get it fixed
[46:52] brothers and sisters many of us have
[46:53] been here for a long time has God not
[46:56] provided Ed every time that we've needed
[46:58] it every single
[47:00] time and we worry we struggle how am I
[47:05] going to do this but he he does it we
[47:08] look back it's like well wow I got
[47:11] through it and we don't even remember
[47:14] those
[47:15] struggles but when it's here it's like
[47:17] man this is
[47:20] rough for after all these things do the
[47:24] Gentiles seek the unbelievers
[47:27] for your heavenly father knoweth that
[47:29] you have need of these things so he's
[47:31] saying that they hey the unbelievers
[47:33] worry about this stuff you know the
[47:35] people that don't believe in God the
[47:36] people that don't believe in the Lord
[47:37] Jesus they
[47:40] worry that they're not going to be able
[47:42] to pay the bills right they worry that
[47:45] their kids aren't going to be saved
[47:46] aren't going to have a a a happy life or
[47:49] they're going to marry the wrong person
[47:50] or they're not going to have the right
[47:51] career they worry about all these things
[47:54] and he's like hey so the unbelievers
[47:56] worry about this why are you worrying
[47:58] about it because you believe in God
[48:01] right then why are you worrying about
[48:05] it but there's a
[48:07] catch to all this remember Jesus
[48:10] preached earlier in this sermon on The
[48:12] Sermon on the Mount he preached about
[48:14] being honest about giving to others and
[48:16] when someone slaps you on the cheek turn
[48:18] the other cheek and let him slap
[48:20] that to even pray for those that would
[48:23] despitefully use you to love your
[48:25] enemies like you love your
[48:27] friends he just finished praying or he
[48:30] just finished pre preaching about that
[48:32] that was the first part of the sermon
[48:34] now here's the catch verse number
[48:37] 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God
[48:41] and his
[48:43] righteousness and all these things shall
[48:45] be added to
[48:47] you what a
[48:48] promise seek first the kingdom of God
[48:52] seek first the righteousness of God he
[48:54] had just said blessed are that hunger
[48:57] and thirst after righteousness for they
[48:59] shall be filled earlier in his sermon
[49:01] and now he's saying now you seek that
[49:05] righteousness and all these other things
[49:08] they'll be they'll be given to you but
[49:10] here's the most important
[49:13] thing take therefore no thought for
[49:17] tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought
[49:19] for uh for the things of itself
[49:21] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[49:25] thereof English Standard version says
[49:27] don't be anxious about tomorrow for
[49:29] tomorrow will be anxious for
[49:32] itself sufficient for the day is its own
[49:34] trouble I promise you that once you
[49:37] solve this
[49:38] problem you're going to have more
[49:41] tomorrow right they don't go
[49:45] away you just get new ones it's a
[49:49] variety I appreciate it at least it's
[49:51] not the same one
[49:57] I'm but it is though it's you'll get
[50:00] past this one there'll be another one
[50:02] but seek first that Kingdom
[50:05] amen brothers and sisters when we
[50:11] work seek God's righteousness in your
[50:17] career your work will be a better place
[50:19] if you're a Christian at work just like

[50:22] church practice Christianity at work if
[50:25] someone does you wrong at work be kind
[50:28] to
[50:29] them you're a Christian at work too so
[50:33] if somebody insults you or does you
[50:35] wrong or double crosses you let that
[50:38] Christianity come out and then you be
[50:40] kind to that person and help that person
[50:44] whoa It's what Jesus
[50:47] taught and it's not just for the folks
[50:49] in

[50:53] harder for
[50:55] him say what you has no right to treat

[54:35] sorry I just kind of say it broadly and
[54:39] then you take it and apply it to your
[54:41] life all
[54:43] right are you being frivolous brothers
[54:46] and sisters with your spending buying
[54:48] things you don't need to do taking the
[54:50] money that God gives us and blowing it
[54:54] are we doing things like that it's
[54:56] robbing
[54:59] God and if we are robbing God if we are
[55:01] not living up to our role which is
[55:04] seeking first the kingdom of God and his
[55:08] righteousness then we are robbing God of
[55:11] something we're taking the money that
[55:13] God gives
[55:16] us and robbing it you say well it's my
[55:18] money I'll spend it the way I want to
[55:21] what do you mean I Rob God Malachi
[55:23] chapter 3 says this
[55:26] verse eight will man rob
[55:29] God yet you have robbed
[55:32] me but you say wherein have we robbed
[55:35] you and tithes and
[55:37] offerings notice he said tithes and
[55:40] offerings you know me I'm not pandering
[55:42] for money I'm telling you what the word
[55:44] says you are cursed with a curse for you
[55:47] have robbed me even this whole
[55:49] nation bring ye all the tithes into the
[55:53] storehouse that there may be meat meat
[55:55] means food may they that there may be
[55:57] food in my house and prove me now
[56:00] herewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I
[56:02] will not open you the windows of
[56:05] heaven and pour you out a blessing that
[56:08] there shall be not room enough to
[56:12] receive it seek first the kingdom of God
[56:16] and his righteousness and these things
[56:18] will be added to you how do you expect
[56:21] to be successful in life financially if
[56:25] you're not doing what God told
[56:28] you if you're not giving him his
[56:33] first you're not making a deal with God
[56:35] either you know this Prosperity Gospel
[56:38] nonsense you're not making a deal with
[56:40] God is like Lord I'm going to give you
[56:42] my next paycheck then you're going to
[56:43] let me win the
[56:46] lottery that's not what he's
[56:49] saying he's saying just stand fast be
[56:53] steadfast give
[56:56] and then you will receive but as I said
[56:58] it's not it's not a
[57:02] deal and watch how God protects those
[57:04] who are faithful and
[57:07] giving verse 11 and I will rebuke the
[57:10] devour for your sake and he shall not
[57:13] destroy the fruits of your ground

[57:18] Lord of host of host if you're a far
[57:21] farmer your crops will do better if
[57:23] you're a businessman your business will
[57:24] do better if you have a steady job then
[57:26] your finances will go farther farther

[58:28] expensive now than they were a couple
[58:30] years ago so when we got our loan it was
[58:34] great we could pay for it but now it's
[58:36] like Whoa man how are we going to how
[58:38] are we going to finish this house and it
[58:41] was just it's really started to the
[58:43] pressure started to get to us and and so
[58:46] on
[58:48] uh yesterday day before
[58:50] yesterday so we started to bicker you
[58:54] know and I was like you don't need that
[58:56] and this and this and there too much
[58:57] money and and and and she got upset and
[59:00] and you know how husbands and wives do
[59:03] and you know brother brandham tells the
[59:05] story when sister brandham was
[59:08] upset and he walked up to her as a good
[59:14] husband would and he he said honey
[59:18] kindhearted and he said he he wanted to
[59:21] talk he started to talk about things
[59:23] that she would want to talk about and he
[59:25] started cons solar and just like a good
[59:28] husband you know I didn't do
[59:34] that I should have but I didn't do
[59:38] it and so we we continued on in our and
[59:41] our whatever we were doing and then
[59:44] finally we
[59:46] both honey I'm sorry and and I'm sorry
[59:49] and and you know we we made up but we'd
[59:51] already escalated it too far and got mad
[59:54] at each other and
[59:56] both of us just felt terrible about
[59:59] arguing and
[1:00:01] and but and I was like honey it's okay
[1:00:04] everything will be okay and she's like
[1:00:06] honey it's okay you know we're feeling
[1:00:07] good and and then out of the
[1:00:10] blue I get a phone call I get a text and
[1:00:14] we have this little piece of property in
[1:00:18] Jeffersonville and I've been trying to
[1:00:20] sell it for three years and finally we
[1:00:22] just gave up and and it the the um
[1:00:27] contract with the real estate agent
[1:00:29] expired and it was just sitting there
[1:00:32] and right after Stephany and I make up I
[1:00:35] get a phone call from some guy in
[1:00:38] Jeffersonville wanting to buy our lot
[1:00:41] and it was is pretty much exactly the
[1:00:43] money that we would need to finish
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:51] up but we sought first the kingdom amen
[1:00:55] we sought first
[1:00:56] righteousness we we admitted we were we
[1:00:59] were wrong and arguing and then the
[1:01:02] Lord's like if you just do this if
[1:01:04] you'll just be a Christian I'll add to
[1:01:07] it don't worry about it I know your
[1:01:09] heart when you went into this I know
[1:01:11] what you're doing and you may have
[1:01:13] regrets and and think that I made a
[1:01:15] mistake but the Lord
[1:01:17] knows and he's it's a promise right here
[1:01:20] he said I'm gonna provide for
[1:01:23] you there's a story
[1:01:27] that we all know but I I want to I want
[1:01:30] to tell this story again in the book of
[1:01:33] First
[1:01:34] Kings and what
[1:01:37] happens in chapter 17 is is this man
[1:01:41] this great Prophet
[1:01:43] Elijah he comes and he he just comes out
[1:01:49] of nowhere and he goes to the
[1:01:53] king and he says neither due nor rain is
[1:01:58] going to fall until I call for it later
[1:02:02] on we know that Elijah prayed under the
[1:02:05] anointing of God Elijah prayed that it
[1:02:09] wouldn't rain because of the evilness of
[1:02:12] this man Ahab and his wife
[1:02:15] Jezebel so he's Elijah prays this and
[1:02:19] brothers and sisters when we pray for
[1:02:23] something and it's the Lord's will we
[1:02:26] have to live in that
[1:02:28] prayer and it might not be the easiest
[1:02:30] thing when we're praying we want God's
[1:02:33] Will and we want to live in God's Will
[1:02:36] and here is Elijah and he prayed that it
[1:02:38] wouldn't rain and he had to live in that
[1:02:43] famine that was created from that prayer
[1:02:47] so Elijah the Lord tells Elijah he says
[1:02:50] go up to this Brook and stay there he
[1:02:54] says I've commanded Ravens to feed need
[1:02:56] you so Elijah goes up and he's sitting
[1:03:00] by this Brook and every morning and
[1:03:02] every evening the birds would bring him
[1:03:05] food what what a tremendous testimony
[1:03:08] Elijah sought first the kingdom of God
[1:03:10] and his righteousness and then it was
[1:03:13] added to him he got what he needed he
[1:03:15] got his food and he got he got his Dr
[1:03:17] his water from the brook and everything
[1:03:19] was working out good and he's there and
[1:03:22] then the brook dries
[1:03:24] up because
[1:03:26] again it was a famine and it was a
[1:03:29] drought so God tells Elijah he says go
[1:03:35] down to this place first Kings
[1:03:41] 178 and the word of the Lord came to him
[1:03:43] saying arise and get thee to zerath
[1:03:46] which belongeth to zidon and dwell there
[1:03:50] behold I have commanded a widow woman
[1:03:52] there to sustain thee stop there for a
[1:03:55] moment
[1:03:56] I have commanded a widow woman to
[1:03:58] sustain
[1:04:03] you that's amazing an amazing
[1:04:09] statement there's
[1:04:11] people in this situation now all many of
[1:04:15] us might be in this situation we might
[1:04:18] be this Elijah or we might be this widow
[1:04:22] woman God knew
[1:04:26] what his commandment was the widow woman
[1:04:30] or Elijah knew that God told him but you
[1:04:33] know who was left out of the knowledge
[1:04:35] the widow woman yet she was
[1:04:39] commanded to sustain this man of
[1:04:45] God so he arose and went to zerath and
[1:04:50] when he came to the gate of the city
[1:04:52] behold the widow woman was there
[1:04:54] Gathering sticks and he called to her
[1:04:57] and said fetch me I pray thee a little
[1:04:59] water in a vessel that I may
[1:05:02] drink and as she was going to f fetch it
[1:05:05] he called her and said bring me I pray
[1:05:08] thee a morsel of bread in thy
[1:05:11] hand and she said as the Lord thy God
[1:05:14] liveth I have not a cake but a handful
[1:05:17] of meal and a barrel and a little oil
[1:05:19] and a Cru and behold I am Gathering two
[1:05:22] sticks that I may go in and dress it for
[1:05:24] me and my son that we may eat it and
[1:05:27] die so she was starving to death and
[1:05:31] worse than her starving to death her son
[1:05:33] her little boy was starving to
[1:05:36] death and imagine she's going out there
[1:05:38] she grabs two sticks she's going to
[1:05:40] bring it in and start a little fire in
[1:05:42] her stove and she's GNA she's going to
[1:05:44] boil maybe this water and and she's
[1:05:47] going to put this this meal in there use
[1:05:50] the water maybe to to get the meal and
[1:05:52] then fry it up and that's going to be
[1:05:54] the last meal that she has there was no
[1:05:56] chance for
[1:05:58] anymore imagine her looking at her
[1:06:01] son his maybe sunken in cheeks little
[1:06:05] skinny
[1:06:06] arms she sees her boy
[1:06:10] dying and she looks and here comes this
[1:06:14] man maybe she knew him maybe she didn't
[1:06:16] I don't know and she says and he says go
[1:06:21] and get me a drink and she says okay
[1:06:23] I'll go get you some and he and he says
[1:06:24] and make me
[1:06:26] some food too and she says she didn't
[1:06:30] lie she says listen she says all I have
[1:06:33] is this handful of
[1:06:34] meal and just this little bit of oil
[1:06:37] it's all I've got in my house many of us
[1:06:40] someone might ask us for
[1:06:42] money and my first answer is I don't
[1:06:44] have any money and I might have a $20
[1:06:46] bill in my
[1:06:47] wallet but she was
[1:06:49] honest and she
[1:06:51] said we don't have anything but just
[1:06:53] this little bit and then I Elijah said
[1:06:57] something
[1:06:58] so strange but Elijah knew that he was
[1:07:02] commissioned of God he knew that God had
[1:07:05] prepared this woman to feed him to take
[1:07:08] care of him he knew that God was with
[1:07:10] him but the woman didn't know that God
[1:07:13] had commanded
[1:07:14] her all of
[1:07:16] us look at look at through your lives
[1:07:19] how many times have you gone forward in
[1:07:23] faith not knowing and then you do
[1:07:27] something and you look back and you say
[1:07:29] that was God it's the same thing he
[1:07:32] commanded you to do it you just didn't
[1:07:34] know you were walking perfectly in God's
[1:07:37] Will and that's this woman here she has
[1:07:41] no
[1:07:46] idea and Elijah said unto
[1:07:50] her fear
[1:07:53] not go and do as thou Hast said but make
[1:07:56] me there thereof a little cake first and
[1:07:59] bring it unto me and after make for thee
[1:08:02] and for thy
[1:08:03] son she must have thought and I know
[1:08:06] this man's a man of God but she's asking
[1:08:08] for the little he's asking for the
[1:08:10] little bit that I have God's asking just
[1:08:13] for this little morsel that I have how
[1:08:15] much more important was
[1:08:18] that than all the granaries that maybe
[1:08:21] Ahab had stored
[1:08:23] up this is what God had chosen
[1:08:26] this is the
[1:08:28] blessed as as we've heard the prophet
[1:08:31] say the hidden
[1:08:33] Mana maybe the Mana that was put into
[1:08:35] the ark this is something this meal is
[1:08:41] blessed for thus sayith the Lord God of
[1:08:45] Israel the barrel of meal shall not
[1:08:47] waste neither shall the Cru of oil fail
[1:08:50] until the day that the Lord sends reain
[1:08:52] upon the Earth so she was Pres presented
[1:08:56] with the word of
[1:08:57] God seek first the kingdom of
[1:09:01] God and his
[1:09:03] righteousness she was presented with
[1:09:06] that and it these things shall be added
[1:09:08] to you it's the same thing Elijah is
[1:09:10] telling her that the Lord Jesus was
[1:09:12] saying when he looked out upon the
[1:09:15] audience on The Sermon on the
[1:09:18] Mount and he said seek first the kingdom
[1:09:21] of God and all this anxiety that you
[1:09:22] have it'll be added to you and she did
[1:09:25] according to the saying of Elijah and
[1:09:27] she and her house did eat many days and
[1:09:30] the barrel of meal wasted not de neither
[1:09:33] did the Cru of oil fail according to the
[1:09:35] word
[1:09:36] of the
[1:09:39] Lord which he spake by his Prophet
[1:09:44] Elijah so every time she put her hand in
[1:09:46] that mirror that that
[1:09:49] Barrel she dumped it out she gave it to
[1:09:52] Elijah she goes back in there puts her
[1:09:54] hand in there there's another
[1:09:56] handful takes the Cru of
[1:09:59] oil wow she makes it up she fries it up
[1:10:04] they get hungry again she reaches in
[1:10:06] there it's another one a
[1:10:09] miracle how many of us can say lord
[1:10:12] always provided for me he always took
[1:10:15] care of me he was always there for me
[1:10:18] when I needed it he never forsook me I
[1:10:20] thought I was so poor and I thought I
[1:10:22] was so destitute I I thought everything
[1:10:24] was bad and I thought all my family was
[1:10:26] gone and then all of a sudden it's
[1:10:30] changed and there's a turn of events in
[1:10:32] each thing for
[1:10:34] us that the Lord has his hand on it just
[1:10:38] like he had his hand on this widow woman
[1:10:41] that was commanded to do one of the
[1:10:44] greatest things that we read in the
[1:10:46] book and she had no
[1:10:49] idea it's one of the best
[1:10:53] stories I mean we we look at all the
[1:10:55] people out there at that time with Ahab
[1:10:57] and Jezebel and and and all of a sudden
[1:11:00] this little widow woman shows up in her
[1:11:04] son and God had mercy on her and gave
[1:11:07] her a great work to
[1:11:12] do how many times can we say it and it's
[1:11:15] happened to
[1:11:16] us everybody can but we don't recognize
[1:11:20] God for what he
[1:11:21] does but seek first the kingdom of God
[1:11:25] live right be a
[1:11:28] Christian do your do exactly what Jesus
[1:11:32] says in all parts of your life honey I
[1:11:35] told them about our argument the other
[1:11:39] day it's all her
[1:11:42] fault that's what I told him no I
[1:11:45] [Laughter]
[1:11:49] didn't but when we sought the kingdom of
[1:11:52] God he provided and when we sought his
[1:11:55] his righteousness he provided
[1:11:58] it when
[1:12:00] Martha and and Mary when Jesus came to
[1:12:04] their
[1:12:07] house Jesus entered into the village a
[1:12:10] woman named Martha welcomed her into the
[1:12:13] house and she had called her her sister
[1:12:16] Mary who sat at the Lord's feet and
[1:12:18] listened to his teaching but Martha was
[1:12:21] distracted with much serving and she
[1:12:24] went up to him and said Lord do you not
[1:12:27] care that my
[1:12:31] sister I'm doing all the
[1:12:33] work and she's left me alone to do all
[1:12:36] this tell her to help
[1:12:38] me I'm cleaning the dishes and I'm I'm
[1:12:41] serving the food and I'm sweeping the
[1:12:44] floor and all look at look at the sink
[1:12:46] it's all full of dishes and nobody's
[1:12:48] there to help me and there's Mary just
[1:12:51] sitting at your feet listening to you
[1:12:53] talk
[1:12:56] and then Jesus rebukes her and he says
[1:12:59] Martha you're too you got too much
[1:13:01] anxiety about the things of the
[1:13:03] world Mary is more right because she
[1:13:08] sought the kingdom of God and his
[1:13:12] righteousness she wanted that
[1:13:15] word I always related more to to
[1:13:19] Martha I would have been that believe me
[1:13:21] I would have been the Martha I would
[1:13:23] have been been out there I'd have been
[1:13:24] the one working say no I'm not the only
[1:13:25] one the place does
[1:13:28] anything and then the other people would
[1:13:29] have been more right than
[1:13:31] me and here is Mary and she's just
[1:13:35] taking in these beautiful words from the
[1:13:38] Lord wouldn't you have loved to been
[1:13:41] Mary and listening to I would have loved
[1:13:43] to been Martha too and serving the lord
[1:13:47] Jesus such a such a wonderful wonderful
[1:13:50] thing and then he says Martha you're
[1:13:53] anxious and you're troubled but there's
[1:13:55] one thing that is necessary Mary has
[1:13:58] chosen the good portion which will not
[1:14:00] be taken away from
[1:14:04] her there's Cain and
[1:14:09] Abel they
[1:14:14] uh they come to the Lord and they build
[1:14:18] their Altar and they make their
[1:14:22] sacrifice and here is Cain and he's
[1:14:24] thinking here here is what's the best
[1:14:26] looking here is here is what that the
[1:14:28] Lord will be more pleased with look at
[1:14:31] how much better my altar looks than his
[1:14:33] pile of rocks with blood on it and a
[1:14:37] dead
[1:14:38] animal look at how much better mine is
[1:14:42] than his and then God looks down and he
[1:14:45] refuses
[1:14:47] Cain he says Cain just do it like
[1:14:52] this but Cain was full of him himself he
[1:14:56] would not
[1:14:57] change he wanted to do it his way he
[1:15:00] wasn't seeking the righteousness of God
[1:15:02] he was seeking the
[1:15:07] the he was he was seeking
[1:15:11] fame he was seeking
[1:15:13] recognition he was seeking
[1:15:17] validation when Abel he was just seeking
[1:15:20] the righteousness of God he just wanted
[1:15:22] he just wanted God to be glorified
[1:15:26] and then at the end of the story Jes the
[1:15:29] Lord says if thou doest if thou doest
[1:15:32] well Cain if you do well look at how God
[1:15:35] loved even
[1:15:37] Cain he wanted Cain to succeed he wanted
[1:15:41] Cain to be saved he didn't want Cain to
[1:15:43] make a mistake and he says he said if
[1:15:45] you if you do well then you then you'll
[1:15:49] be
[1:15:51] accepted but if you do not well he said
[1:15:54] then Cain sin lies at the door for you

[1:22:40] amen amen brothers and sisters
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:44] it's the best thing that we can do in
[1:22:47] life is to be a
[1:22:49] Christian I was
[1:22:52] wondering how do I know if if I was that
[1:22:55] widow
[1:22:56] woman how do I know that God has
[1:22:58] commanded me to do
[1:23:01] something because he didn't come down
[1:23:03] like he did to Elijah the prophet he
[1:23:05] didn't come down and talk to him talk to
[1:23:07] her like that she just was faced with a
[1:23:12] decision and she made the right decision
[1:23:16] and I think that there is a
[1:23:19] pull that's on
[1:23:21] us and as we pray and as we go through
[1:23:25] life there's something that's just
[1:23:29] pulling on us to do something and you
[1:23:32] know that if it's not God you know that
[1:23:36] it glorifies
[1:23:38] yourself but if it is
[1:23:40] God then
[1:23:42] it's glorifying
[1:23:45] him and it's usually the harder thing to
[1:23:48] do and it usually requires a sacrifice
[1:23:51] of your time a sacrifice of your prayer
[1:23:54] prayers he usually requires that like
[1:23:59] this widow woman then the rest of the
[1:24:02] story her son
[1:24:05] died and there was that man of
[1:24:08] God there and man of God raised up the
[1:24:13] child to live with his mom she was a
[1:24:17] blessed
[1:24:18] lady and I just think she was
[1:24:21] commanded by God to do something
[1:24:26] great I want to feel that commandment
[1:24:29] Lord I want to be in that channel you
[1:24:32] may not say it to
[1:24:34] me but you can still command me to do
[1:24:38] something we were talking the other
[1:24:42] night
[1:24:43] about how do I know when I have the Holy
[1:24:48] Spirit how do I know when it really is
[1:24:51] dwelling in me
[1:24:54] and there's a number of different ways
[1:24:57] that we
[1:24:58] know one of those
[1:25:01] ways is that there is just a continually
[1:25:07] refilling of the Holy Spirit we know the
[1:25:09] parable of the wise and the the foolish
[1:25:12] virgin the wise virgin kept that oil in
[1:25:15] the lamp all the time and it was
[1:25:17] constantly filling it up but then there
[1:25:20] is that place that we get to like this
[1:25:23] Widow woman where we bow down and we say
[1:25:26] Lord whatever you require that will I
[1:25:32] do then you know that Holy Spirit is
[1:25:37] operating right there and that's what we
[1:25:39] all need to be brothers and
[1:25:41] sisters Lord whatever you require of me
[1:25:45] whatever you want me to do I'll do it no
[1:25:48] matter what it
[1:25:49] is if you want me to go witness to
[1:25:52] homeless people if you want me
[1:25:55] to move to another
[1:25:58] place if you want me to serve every
[1:26:02] person
[1:26:03] here do whatever I can that's the Holy
[1:26:06] Spirit operating in
[1:26:08] us if we're completely
[1:26:12] surrender brother brandom said
[1:26:15] this he said but you can't become you
[1:26:18] can't be a
[1:26:21] Christian until Christ injects him
[1:26:24] himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:27] into you then you're connected with him
[1:26:30] you're no longer Twain you are one
[1:26:33] Christ promised to be in us as the
[1:26:37] father was in Christ I and my father are
[1:26:40] one you and I are one see Christ in us
[1:26:44] now listen to
[1:26:47] this all that God was he poured into
[1:26:52] Christ and all all that Christ was he
