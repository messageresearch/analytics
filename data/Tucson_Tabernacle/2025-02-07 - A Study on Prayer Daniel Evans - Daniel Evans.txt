========================================

[Music] you may take one by side the less you pray the harder it is to pray and she looked at me kind of funny and and um she she was taken back by what I said so then I had to get in touch with her later on I got in touch with her and she said I had a dream and she said you looked she said you were in my dream and she said you looked at me and she said you are Weeping because of my sins and she said and then what you told me came back the more you pray the more you want to pray and she said I've I've never heard anything that ever sounded like that in my life she said is is this like what Christianity is and I said yes sister it is and and I witnessed to her and I believe I gave her a Bible and um I pray that everything worked out and then that's the last I I ever lost touch with her obviously but wondering did that stick and where is that woman today another time um a man I've told this story before a man that was a prisoner pretty much his whole life real rough guy real big guy his name is Don Marsh I think I preached a sermon one Sunday night about him I had met him he was standing outside the brandom Tabernacle leaning up against the wall and I walked up to him and I I said uh hi brother I said I see you out out here standing here I I said I want to know who you are my name's Daniel Evans and and he said brother he said nobody ever talks to me and I said well I guess I'm a nobody then I said I'm talking to you and he says no brother he says I've done time he says I've done hard time he says I've got a past I said okay well that's all right I said we can put our past behind us and and I talked to him for a little while and it turns out he was in prison for violent crimes well he showed up at uh the church one day and and I was there during the middle of the day and he was upset and he walked in and he said my son was attacked and beat up by this other this other kid and he says he says brother I had to he says when I saw my son and and the shape that he was in he said I just had to leave he says and I came right down here and he says I'm goingon to kill him he says I need you to pray for me' I did one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my life I walked up to him and got right in his face and I said don't you dare waste my time I said if you're coming here to be delivered then God will deliver you I said but I don't want my time to be wasted on somebody like you who doesn't really believe and he looked at me he stepped back and this guy's huge Brother John dude Daniel yeah Daniel knew him well he said uh well he said that's good counsel Lord I said good I was ready man I was ready to block that right right hook and and run away I guess but he uh we prayed and uh everything worked out and then I became friends with him I was friends with him for years and he always told me he said brother that day that I came in and you prayed for me he said that temper and those violent tendencies they left me on that day and he says they've never come back Daniel Amen Daniel knew him and I look at I look at those times and then I look at times when my mother was dying of cancer and I fasted so much I lost like 25 or 30 pounds and and in prayer all the time and fasting and seeing my mom suffer and like I've said before I've never seen a Christian that that could compare to my mom and seeing her wither away to nothing and then Die Why did the Lord not seemingly answer my prayers here but he did in another place there was another time that I was I was having a dream about a friend of mine and this is the only time that I can remember in my life that I I've heard a voice I had a dream and and I woke up from the dream and uh the dream was was him and me and a bunch of friends playing basketball together was just a dream that just a normal dream that you have and we were just shooting hoops and playing basketball and I woke up from the dream and I was thinking of him and and his wife and a voice spoke not like that voice that we hear when we're when we're in prayer that the Lord speaks to you but a voice that you can hear like you're hearing my voice now said these words said pray for them and I got up and prayed for him and uh I see now that the brother has turned and is having a very very hard life and is a dear dear friend since I was a kid and has made some really bad choices in his life and I can see why maybe the Lord wanted me to pray for him some 15 10 15 years ago and then I'm going to go through a few of these testimonies another time we were um at the brandom Tabernacle and just going to church I was on a Wednesday night like this and probably about as crowded as as this room is right now and we were listening to a tape of brother brandom and I got we got towards the end of the tape and I've always in my whole life I've struggled I've suffered with a stomach condition and I would buy those you know the cheap like toms the big one the contractor pack and then I I'd have a handful of them I'd bring them I put them in my pocket and then I I would I would go to work and and the my chest would feel like I was having a heart attack and it was the worst pain you could have and I would just lay my head across my desk and I would eat the TS and drink water and and it would go away well that night at the Tabernacle it was the end of the tape and brother brandom said lay your hands on one another like he did so many times most of you have heard him and it was like this and we all laid our hands on each other and nothing I didn't feel anything and a brother behind me we would we would sit with my family here and brother Steve klopp and his family would sit behind us and brother Steve put hand on me and I had my hand on the person in front of me and we put our hands on each other and prayed and then we ended and I didn't feel anything every everything was normal it was nice nice service so I walked out and we were um by our car and we were talking fellowshipping and brother Steve walked up to me and he said brother Dan I just want to tell you he says I really believe the Lord's going to heal your stomach and I said well thanks brother Steve you know I appreciate that and that was in I believe 2009 2010 and I've S I suffered with my stomach problem my whole life in high school I suffered with it and that was the end of it and it never came back that was the end of my stomach problems that night I didn't feel anything but something about brother Steve he had faith and he laid his hands on me and and I was healed amen and then another time we were Daniel was there and Daniel's a witness to this we were at the brandom Tabernacle and this is um this is fairly recently we um we were taking they were taking up the offering and I saw my brother Adam get up and Adam was in charge of all the first aid Adam gets up and he goes and grabs Dr Golden who is another friend of mine and they go over and I look down our row and there is brother James Jackson and brother James Jackson is dead I could see it I looked over I told Daniel I told uh brother Trevor Eman behind me I said he's gone he's dead you could tell his his shirt was wet he his mouth was open his eyes were open turns out he was dead for over 30 minutes and looked down there and we continued taking up the offering that was when he was noticed and we we were we continued and and I remember I bowed my head and I asked the Lord I said Lord raise him up and there was such a feeling of faith in that room there's probably 800 people there so a lot of people witnessed what I'm saying right now there was such a faith in there I wasay praying and I and what's funny is um Brother David Phillips was I was on the aisle and Brother David Phillips was a deacon and he bumped me and I looked up at him and he pointed and oh the the offering basket was right there so I took it and I gave it to Brother David and when he woke me up or um when he didn't wake me up but when he when I came out of my prayer I looked down and the color had come back into brother James and he was breathing and he was back and we gave a a testimony the testimony is online I um I got I got uh I interviewed the doctor I interviewed my brother I interviewed another brother that was there and the doctor said he was dead there was no pulse there was no respiration my brother said he was dead both of them had seen many many people die both of them were there it's amazing that you have a trauma a surgeon here and you have an experienced EMT there both at the same time and someone dies and comes back to life I don't think there's been a more well documented resurrection of the Dead than that why then and you see how many times have we heard brother brandom and brother brandham would my grandfather was with brother brandom and and they were fishing and he was Bitten on the on the foot by a snake brother brandham goes over to him and his his his foot is throbbing and it's hurting brother brandham goes over to him lays his hand on my grandfather and says a very simple little prayer Lord that it is written in your word that they shall tread on serpents and scorpions and nothing by any means will harm them and immediately my grandfather was healed and they fished the rest of the day another time my grandfather's and was car was stolen from Louisville and they got a ride they they were out to eat they got a ride to Brother brandom's house brother brandham gets everybody together in his den all my dad's family they kneel down and they pray and brother brandom says Lord would you send the Holy Spirit after this person that has stolen their car and would you condemn him and have him bring it back brother brandom loaned my grandpa my grandpa and my family the car they're driving about I don't know a couple hours later and the car was stolen in Louisville on the south side of the river brother brandom lived in Jeffersonville they get the brother braham's car they drive over my dad looks over in Jeffersonville and says look dad there's our car the man had brought it back yes amen the prayers and the power of the prayers and yet brother brandom was there and his little daughter was dying and there is little Sharon Rose and he said she was he said she was shaking he he her little fat leg was shaking and and she was in such pain that she would go crosseyed and here's brother brandom and he says Lord Heal my baby girl and he said the Lord just like brought down a sheet between him between brother brandom and God brother brandom said Lord the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and the little baby his own sweet baby died and he buried her on top of his wife who had just died a little bit earlier this man that all of these people would come through the prayer line and so many people would get healed why did his daughter die many miracles had happened before and then brother brandom had a stomach problem himself he had it his whole life struggled with it and and and it was just it was eating his stomach up and he he had ulcers and it was just a problem that he just dealt with all of the time and then on the wings of a snow white dove he preaches a sermon gives a testimony that he was up in Sabino Canyon and he has an experience and the Lord healed him of something that he had struggled with his whole life been less than 30 days later he died why what is it about prayer why does God do it sometimes and other times he doesn't do it I was listening to the seventh seal yesterday by brother brandham and he was giving the testimony of when he was up in the mountain up in Sabino Canyon and he was praying had both of his hands up and he was praying and something struck his hand and he looked and it was a sword and he made the state and this is the statement that just took me back it said and I just knew that brother Brandon was so into prayer he was he was so outside of himself he said did I fall asleep I don't know he said was it a vision he said I can't say all I know is it happened in prayer what is it about this man that seems different than anyone else brother brandham said the gift that I have he says if I have a gift he says the gift that I have is being able to get William brandom completely out of the way that's what prayer really is let me go back you don't have to put it up there I just read likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we should but we don't know what we should pray for but the spirit itself makes intercessions for us with groanings with words that can't be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what the mind of the spirit is because he makes intercessions for the Saints according to the will of God Amen think about brother brandom up there he was just praying he wasn't may I don't know what he was praying for he was just praying and then God places that in his in his hand and it didn't matter if he was asleep it didn't matter if it was a vision it didn't matter what it was to brother Brandon What mattered that is that he was in God's will the uh the Prophet Elijah he went up to the to the brook he called for a drought to come he went up to the brook and the brook dried up God sent him over to this widow woman this widow woman fed him and Elijah was able to through the will of God and and and through a vision that the the Lord was blessed this widow woman because of what she did fed her all the time that this drought was going on and this this widow woman's son she had this young young boy that was her her who her only family the young man dies and she brings him to Elijah First Kings 17:19 it says this and Elijah said unto her give me thy son and and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he Abode and laid him upon his own bed this man Elijah prayed we know that we just went through James we know how much Elijah prayed and Elijah he knew that since he prayed he knew that that bed that he slept on was blessed so he puts this Baby First Kings 17 20 he puts this young boy on this bed and then he cries out to the Lord and he said oh Lord my God hast thou also brought evil upon the Widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her son and he stretched himself upon the child three times and Cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my God I pray thee let this child Soul come back into him again and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul the child came back into him again and he revived Hallelujah the prayer of a righteous man and then Elijah Elijah's Protege Elisha we know the story of the shunamite woman she was kind to him and she built this room off of her house where the man of God could come and stay and then one day he asked his servant gesi he says he says what can we do for this lady she's done so much for us can can I go and talk to the king for can I can I do can I can I help her with talking to the the the Master of Arms what can I do to help this lady and gesi says she doesn't have any children Elijah Elisha and her husband's old so then Elijah goes straight Elisha goes straight to her we don't have any record of Elijah praying Elisha praying he goes straight to to her and says you're going to have a son and she has this son just like the skin tag I didn't pray about it I just knew there was something about it that God just told me it was going to go away and here is Elisha and with the same Spirit he says God's going to give you a child this she has this child the child grows up he's out plowing with his dad and he he gets a headache and he says he says Dad my head hurts my head so he he takes a servant he says take take him in to his mom she comes in or he comes into her he lays down on her on her lap She lays him down on her lap and she and the boy dies this one that God had given them I'm sure she loved him so much so then second Kings chapter 4 we'll read the story verse 29 then he said to GES G up thy loins and and take my staff so so the shunamite woman comes and and she tells Eli Elisha what had happened then Elisha says to his servant Gesa G up thy loins and take take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child this man Elisha who had prayed so much he knew not because he thought something great of himself but he knew that whatever he touched was blessed that's why we have prayer claws it's perfectly scriptural according to this scripture right here take my staff and lay it on the child and the mother and and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and he arose and he followed her back to her son and gesi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went in again to meet him and he told him saying the child is not awake and when Elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed do you remember the story of Elijah and the shunamite woman she took that child and laid him on the bed of this man of God Elisha he went in therefore and shut the door upon them Twain and prayed unto the Lord and he went up and lay upon the child remember what Elijah did Elisha must have known that story that his teacher Elijah had taught him the testimony that he gave it's why these testimonies they're important that we hear them when we know it can be done and here's Elisha he does the same thing and Elisha was come to the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed and he went in and shut the door upon them Twain and prayed unto the Lord and he went and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and stretched himself upon the child and the Flesh of the child waxed warm L and then he returned but he didn't wake up the child didn't revive but warmth came in him and he walked back and forth Elijah was was struggling well Elijah when he prayed for him he just rose up and how come it's not working for me he continued to pray he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself on him and then the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes another answered prayer and then this man James 5: 16 says this confess your faults one to another and pray one for another amen that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much it makes a difference this Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are the one I told about the widow woman and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it didn't rain on the earth for the space of three and a half three years and six months and he prayed again and Heaven gave the rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit another answered prayer why why did he answer this prayer and not these other prayers the answer is in the word and I believe it's in that scripture that I read first but first let's go to First Peter chapter 3 and I think this will start to get us there 1 Peter chapter 3:1 likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word that they also May without the word be won by the convers of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of the plated hair and a wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection to their their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord James is getting to a point this is husband and wife here even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and aren not afraid with any amazement likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of Grace that your prayers be not hindered a fight between a husband and a wife your prayers are hindered love should take precedence over everything including getting your way if you start if you start giving then she'll start giving love will breed love and strife will be breed strife and this fighting will hinder our prayers in our family and everywhere else finally be ye all of One mind James tells this story and now he's saying okay now you be of one mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrary wise blessing knowing that you are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing again conflict and fighting will hinder your prayers why because it becomes about your own ideas Unity among Christians can only be can only become real if we truly desire God's will sister Shirley and I were talking before service brother brandham said if I have a gift as I said it's to get William brandham out of the way and if there is to be any Unity among Christian people or any people at all we have to set aside our own thinking we have to set aside our own desires even as a family when we fight somebody has to set aside what they want and that is the Christian way otherwise we have different divisions of Christianity fighting against each other not supporting or maybe not fighting against each other always but not supporting each other and because it's about our own desires it's about our own feelings and that's what causes the conflict and when we get down and pray we might be praying for our own our own wants and not setting aside our wants and really getting ourselves out of the way and saying Lord what do you want we forget about how go great God God is and how great God is is we want to get into his program and if we can get into his program that's when the Deb are raised that's when the prayers are answered is because it's his choice and not our choice I've heard so many times people say do you think God would wait a minute you can fill in whatever you want do you think God would want this well are you speaking for God have you prayed and have you got an answer from God on these things it may sound strange but we are not God it's not God's job to do what we want it is our job to do what God wants verse number eight or 26 I'm sorry likewise the spirit also helpeth our in infirmities I'm sorry I'm going back to Romans I want to read it again likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself makes intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he makes intercessions for the Saints according to the will of God so when we are praying we need to stop asking asking the Lord to do something unless it's the spirit speaking through us and then we ask but the hardest thing is not to pray for someone to be healed is to pray for God's Will and then if we can truly get ourselves out of the way then we will know what God's will is and we can say rise up and walk dead man you rise up God this is God speaking this isn't me speaking but instead we get our own desires we want our own way we want I want my own music I want my own pews I want my own Doctrine I want my own preacher I want my own religion I want it the way I want it that is the biggest failure of humankind it's the biggest failure of all of us we want our way and then we'd make God into this as brother brandom called him an Aaron boy and that's not right we should be his Aaron boy we should set aside our way of thinking Lord what do you want what is your perfect will Lord I I Surrender my will and that's when you see things happen and it can be a a fight between a husband and a wife whatever it is Lord what is your will for we know not what we should should pray for is what the Apostle Paul said as we should read it again for we know not what we should pray for but the spirit itself makes intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be othered wow wow and he that searches the hearts know what is the mind of the spirit so he that this holy spirit that knows our hearts he knows what's the mind of God so our role is just to get into his way of thinking just to get ourselves out of the way our own wants and our own desires and sacrifice ourselves Romans 12 121 my favorite scripture it says make your body a Living Sacrifice to God which is your reasonable service that is the hardest thing we have desires we have wants but get ourselves out of the way and get into his way of thinking disagree ments are normal and and many times they're healthy you should bring up concerns of course we all should because none of us are perfect but when they cause division then our prayers are hindered it could be in a church it could be a husband and a wife that's when the prayers don't work because they are self-serving amen listen to Christ's prayer for the church John chapter 17 verse 20 it says this Jesus now this is the last time this is the last prayer that we know of from Jesus he says neither I pray for these alone verse number 29 I'm I'm sorry 20 you're right neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me whoa their Unity is going to prove that Jesus Christ is the Messiah that they may also be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as We Are One in them i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me says it again and thou Hast and Hast loved them as thou has loved me father I will that they also whom thou G whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world Jesus in his prayer is interceding on the behalf of the ones that he loves remember job job interceded on behalf of his children he made sacrifices not even knowing what their sins were he sacrificed just in case that they had sinned so we if we can truly get into the spirit of Christ if we can truly get into him then we are able to make that prayer of intercession for each other because it's not us speaking we can't intercede there's no there's no Mary no Peter no James no John as the Catholic Church says but that same spirit that can speak through us through our prayers if we can set aside our own thinking and this is exactly what Jesus is doing here he says oh righteous father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou Hast sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou Hast loved me may be in them in i in them amen I'll go down a little rabbit hole real quick so this doesn't work with the trinitarian argument that there are three independent manifestations of God that's the Holy Spirit that's in us and Jesus here says that I am going to be in them so it kind of torpedoes that ship as far as as as far as the trinitarian way of thinking but if we have Unity if we're standing together in one common cause then we need to pray about what that cause is and how do we sincerely pray back to Romans again for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself makes intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be othered the key to prayer is to get our own desires out of the way and to seek the desires of God what is the desire of Christ we know we just read it his last prayer that his disci disciples heard that they would be one and how can we all be one it's not by my leadership in this church it's not by Brother brand leadership or by anyone's leadership it's only by the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's how we can be one for we know not what we should pray for as we should but the spirit makes intercessions I'll skip down let's go down to John 14:12 says this verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I that that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son not that you're going to get what you want but it's so the father would be glorified through Jesus Christ that is why he answers prayer if you ask anything St John a couple verses later if you ask anything in my name I will do it right after he says that the father may be glorified in the son and if this is so that you ask anything in my name and I'll do it and I'm running out of time so I'm going to go through these scriptures quickly Romans 12:12 I'll read the NIV version of this one it says Be Joyful in Hope patient in Affliction faithful in prayer Philippians 4:6 again I'll read the ni IV it says ' don't be anxious about anything but in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present with Thanksgiving present your request to God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus Colossians 4:2 King James version says continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving Philippians 5:17 says pray pray without ceasing second Timothy 1:3 says I thank God whom I serve Paul speaking from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day praying all the time James 5:13 says any is any among you Afflicted let them let him pray is any marry let him sing Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man Avail of much prayers that we have we bring them before God but first we need to know God's Will and the only way to know God's will is to consecrate ourselves to him and to ask him Lord what do you want and it's the hardest thing in the world to get yourself out of the way it is the hardest thing in the world to get your wants out of the way do you think God would want somebody to Suffer Well we shouldn't ask those questions because he did say that suffering perfects us so maybe he does I don't think he wants us to hurt but he knows what's right he knows what's good he knows the end Ephesians 6 I'll go through this one quickly we all know this and we we've probably heard many many sermons on this Ephesians 6:18 613 613 it says this wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may able be able to withstand the withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about with truth and have having the breast plate of righteousness we've heard this how many sermons have we heard on this above all your feet should be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God we know that this armor of the holy spirit that someone puts on as a Christian but don't forget the the next verse is probably the most important of all of them praying always how do you think you can put on the helmet of salvation praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplications for All Saints and for me that other utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the Gospel Paul's saying that the words may be given to me that I might open my mouth boldly to make known this mystery that I might speak the words of God and not the words of Paul but the words that are inspired by the Lord Jesus and those come through prayer how many times I was I was sharing with sister Shirley how many times have I been in prayer just talking to the Lord and something came out of my mouth like what in the world was that I'll share I was I was praying about I don't know Daniel's laughing um 12 years ago maybe Daniel knows a story I was I was at I was um at work in the closet that I would pray in and I was just praying my heart out just like I always do in worshiping and all of a sudden I prayed Lord if you want me to preach your gospel then and I said a few other words and I got up I didn't believe in Preachers I didn't like preachers it's like what in the world did I just say and now I know why I prayed that it was the Holy Spirit not Daniel Evans it was the Holy Spirit speaking through me in private in quiet I'm like wow what in the world was that I'll uh I'll I'll close on this and brother Josiah you and the team can come I talked this morning I don't see sister Amilia here she's one of our missing people I talked with her son Adam today he's he's incarcerated U and uh for a long time and he gave me a testimony this morning that he struggled with cigarettes smoking cigarettes and he would get on his knees and he would pray and pray and pray Lord take these cigarettes away from me and he had smoked for really decades and he would stop for a while and then then it would stir back up in him to smoke more and one day he was praying and he said he said the these words he said' Lord he says I've been lying to You' he said 'if I wanted to stop then I would have and he said it was the Lord then the Lord spoke back to him and said okay now are you done trying and then he said if so then I'll take over so Adam was was he he got up and he he said as he was praying he said that the the the the desire for smoking started to get more and more for for tobacco and he was he was down and and he was praying and and he felt like the Lord was speaking to him and he wanted a cigarette so bad right then so he was able to get through the night without a cigarette the next morning the guards come in and he he used the he used the term the guards told him roll up because you're going to what's called SMU and I guess a supermax is what it was you're going somewhere else so they took Adam to this supermax where there was no tobacco allowed so he gets he gets in there or there they didn't sell tobacco in there he gets in there and he had all of his personal stuff and there was a pouch of tobacco in his personal stuff and they lost it they lost his personal personal um things so he had no access to it so he was in this supermax for 9 months and couldn't smoke if he wanted to smoke he asked the Lord he said Lord I'm tired of it I'm done with it Lord says you ready for me to do it he says yes now you can't so nine months went by and the Lord delivered him from the tobacco and the urge would come up and he'd say I'm not going back and he told me today he said that was a 24y year marriage I had with cigarettes and he says it ended during those nine months so it gave him faith and he said the next thing he said was violence you remember the story about Don Marsh I told earlier he said I I I fought he said I was violent because that's what you had to do in prison and the Lord laid it on his heart to put away violence like he did smoking intimidation and rage was inside of him he intimidated people and he was a respected person in his in his gang and the Lord worked him worked on him on that for a while and he was delivered by that he was delivered from that spirit so then the Lord tested him and there was a black man he was part of the Mexican gang and there was a black man that was part of The Black Gang and this man had it out for him so he challenged Adam to a fight he he uh he wanted to fight him in the yard and Adam told me he says you show up for that fight or there's going to be consequences not just going to be one guy you're fighting now it's going to be the whole gang and they're going to beat you up or kill you so you better just go fight and if you you lose you lose so Adam goes out there and he says I'm not going to do it and then it started getting the group stirred up because he was a leader so now you have the Mexican gang over here and you have The Black Gang over here and they're starting to get fired up and they're they're going to fight and he says well let me just talk to the guy so he goes up to him and the guy says yeah he says you messed up my TV I know you did Adam's like I didn't mess up your television I didn't do that he says yeah you did and Adam's like I didn't do it and so what Adam did was he says hey I have a television you know you can have mine Adam said you don't do that it shows weakness and his gang members would would not back him up his gang members would say hey man you're showing weakness so but Adam says I'm going to do it so then the uh the the the black Clan over here they're going to to still um take out Adam and one of the black guys goes to the gang when and says no no no don't do it to him he's a Christian so the the fight didn't happen and then the the guy still didn't like him ad Adam gave up his television the guy still didn't like him and then Adam gets transferred to another cell block and he starts witnessing to the people and he starts doing well there again staying away from the fighting and he looks out in the yard months later and there's that same guy and Adam waves at him and he was not over it so he goes over over there and now they have the two gangs start to get heated heated up again and Adam says and he goes to talk to him and he says listen he says he says look what I've done for you over the month the time he says I helped you with your bunk he says I gave you food when you were hungry he says ould I do that against somebody that I was against and he said he still told him that you tore up my TV and Adam was like listen you know I gave you I'm sorry I told you you gave him the TV then he gave it actually gave it to him this time and he says he says that they they kind of made made amends and the guy still doesn't like him well then the guy gets transferred away and Adam said that he started preaching to the people around like we can't do this and he asked he asked the the the Christian group he says have you ever got into violence have you ever got into a fight and knew it was from God they all said no Adam used that testimony in the fights in to to subdue the fights in the prison and he's and all of them said no we had never fought for a righteous reason and Adam said now it's been months since there has been a fight in this yard and these gang members in his unit in his block there has not been a fight now for months and months because of Adam's testimony and he says brother that's going on right now and he says I've never seen someone who's really living the word of God go back to violence because Adam prayed and he was praying about it and then the Lord worked it out and did the exact opposite I see Christians me I see Christians who have a Wonder wonderful understanding of the word but they lack the life that comes with the revelation of the word and what's lacking is that because their prayer life is lacking what do you have what do you have to pray for you know you say Lord what do I pray for pray for everything all the promises in the Bible depend on a constant connection with God and the way that we have to do that is through prayer and prayer ultimately produces obedience am I to heal this person in the name of Jesus Christ the lord lays it on your heart then heal him am I to cast out this demon then cast it out but if not if it's not will God's Will and it may not be then you stay silent we seek God's will first and then he will speak likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself makes intercessions for us which groanings for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercessions for the saint Saints according to the will of God Amen so prayer brothers and sisters is obedience it's surrender to God and then once that surrender to God happens he'll do things that you never ever thought you would ever do and he'll do things that you never thought would were possible Adam fought and that's what gave him status but but he gave that up he gave it up and then the Lord took his part and then bless the entire block taking the violence away it's amazing what'll happen if we just truly surrender to God brother you say you all stand he's God that's the song when I come into His presence I humble myself I lift up both my hands and I begin to worship him I worship him when I come when I come into His presence I humble myself I lift up both my hands and I begin to worship him oh I worship him for for all that he's done for [Applause] me redeemed and set me free and because just because he's God when I come into His presence I humble myself remembering what he's done oh the victories he's one so I'll praise him so I'll praise him when I come when I come into His presence I humble myself remembering what he's done all the victories he's won so I praise him oh I'll [Music] praise him for all he's done for me redeemed and set me be free and because just because he's God for all he's done for all is done for me redeemed and set me free and because just because he's [Music] G about having a meeting and he said this he said the Lord willing will have some great Services out there with the Lord's blessings on us as you pray for us that's the only way that we can have it is is when you pray just one of us praying will help but when we all pray together that's when God will go to moving when we all go to praying that's his promise and we know his promises are true can you imagine if we all could have such a walk with God and I seek that so much from myself if we could all have such a walk with God that we could all pray together in these hard decisions that we make in life whether it be little things like the color that's going to be on the on the walls and and and the little decisions that we make every day or whether it be big things like is this person if we could pray for this person to be healed or or that person to meet the right mate but if we could really agree on something Jesus even said that if just two will agree but you have to have the Holy Spirit to agree you have to have God's will to agree or that's not even possible but if we can agree on those things then we can see great things happen I believe they had that at the day of Pentecost I believe they had that in the book of Acts they may not have they may not have agreed have they may have argued sometimes but they came back together in love and in unity and in the Holy Spirit and great things happen I just wonder if one day that we will see that when we have decisions to make we actually pray about them and we set aside our own thinking and we make decisions and we make prayers that it wouldn't be us speaking speaking it would be the Holy Spirit speaking through US wouldn't you love to see that maybe we'll see it one day I think that we can see it in our church I believe we're well on our way we have a wonderful group of people here that that um I've seen I've seen it with my own eyes and I've been so impressed that we feel so strongly about something and then we see the Holy Spirit maybe start to move and we are able to get our own way of thinking out out and make a decision to follow the lord and it may be something that we never thought happened me with me the other day with um um remember voting on the bylaws I was steadfast we're going to do it and uh some people said you know we should wait and not vote on the bylaws and I was like No we're going to do it and then finally I was able to surrender and I said Lord I'm sorry what do you want and I believe he said I don't want you to do it right now and then we were able to to put it off we're still going to do it but um God's time brother Jeremy would you come and close [Music] let's pray gracious Heavenly Father after hearing such a sermon Lord we we Quake within ourselves [Music] that there's there's no way but

the brothers and sisters here especially in the leadership that all of us have been willing to maybe set aside our opinions and really seek God and I I'm so thankful I'm so thankful for each one of you and and then those that aren't here I'm just so I'm so grateful of the kindness and and the willingness to for all of us to really to get down and say Lord what is your will on this I just don't
