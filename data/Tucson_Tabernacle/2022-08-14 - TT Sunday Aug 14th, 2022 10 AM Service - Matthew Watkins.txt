with the holy ghost he desires to fill you more amen he's a good god and he cares for you just another touch lord for me oh just another touch lord from you to help in heart trials i go through may be the night it rains a ray of light when i get a touch lord [Music] oh just another touch lord from you to help in heart trials i go through the dark may be the night it brings a ray of light when i get a touch lord from you we have an anchor aren't you glad of that that keeps the soul we have an anchor that keeps the soul stead fast and sure while the billows roll fastened to the rock which cannot move grounded firm and deep in the savior's love we have an anchor that keeps the soul steadfast and sure while the billows roll fastened to the rock which cannot move grounded firm and deep in the savior's love [Music] i'm gonna ask brother aaron to come and bring the prayer requests we've got our our brother matthew watkins here glad to have him with us and so and his family glad to have you with with us as well but well while brother aaron comes just an announcement something lord's put on my heart is to start having some youth meetings maybe once a month and so lord willing would like to have one this coming friday the 19th have the first one and we'll have we'll start at about 6 30 and that night is the same night as one of the prayer nights that we're going to have we're going to have next thursday friday and saturday from six to eight we're going to have people praying in here as they feel led and i thought it would be really nice to have this first youth meeting at the same time for the reason that it would be really nice to have people praying for this and for the youth and so maybe you're not youth anymore but if you'd like to come and pray then then i just believe that the lord would hear those prayers and that he'd really bless it we could start this this off in the right way we just want to be in the lord's perfect will and we don't want anything outside of that but know that he has everything in control and so for this youth meeting what we'd be looking to have is people come around 6 30 and then maybe 6 45 just to have a little couple songs a short bible lesson something maybe 20 30 minutes and then after that have some some food and refreshments and some games so if if you know any youth or if you are any youth and you'd like to come the ages are open it the the message would probably be geared to somewhere between like 7 and 25 would be kind of the the focused age but if you're younger than seven and you want to come as long as you bring a parent that's okay i can't watch everybody but if if you're younger than seven you want to come as long as you can bring a parent along with you that's great and if if you're older than uh 25 that's you're still totally welcome i would say if you get to be over you know 35 40 and you want to come then then just come and talk to me about a way that you can come and help because we want to have this be focused towards the youth so if you're much farther than that then let's let's figure out a way that we can work together and just minister the word of god and minister by our love one to another so if you pray for me i don't i've never done anything like this before but my confidence is not in my ability or my understanding but just that if the lord if it's lord's will that he can guide us and if it's not the lord's will we'll just stop right away as soon as he shows us so if you'd be in prayer for that if you'd like to come and pray for that on on thursday or friday and just get the word out to anybody that would like to come what we're going to do is we're going to send out on the on the church whatsapp we're going to send out a link um that if you'd like to come you could rsvp so we can know how much food to get and then try to get the amount of food there lined up with that and if if anybody would like to bring you know a dessert or a drink then that's totally fine too but we'll we'll supply the food and we'll just look forward to whatever the lord has for that so how many will pray for that [Music] all right well then just believe that the lord will hear those prayers and this will be a good thing so if brother aaron would come let's as as he comes let's sing reach out and touch the lord ki of f [Music] reach out and touch the lord as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he is [Music] reach out and touch the lord as he one more time reach out and touch the lord as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry he's passing by this moment reach out and touch the load as he goes he's never too far away he's never busy he's never have put you on hold but he pays attention he he speaks to each one of us there are some needs and some things too sister grace taylor stitch says asking prayer for the boys that started school and asking also for unspoken prayer requests so we know school season has started again and i know the young people going to school from from preschool all the way in high school maybe into college or things like that so remember them in a day like this when so much is happening sister amelia she says unspoken prayer request just she has before the lord so we we trust in him he meets every need we got a phone call friday afternoon for my brother they had taken my dad to the hospital he had fallen was not able to get up and that happened early friday morning and then later again uh about 10 o'clock he tried to stand up to answer the door and he fell he hit his head against the door and was not able to get up as my brother had gone to see dad and so he called an ambulance and they took him to uh the old keno hospital it's a u of a hospital now banner and um i found out he was positive for kobit and that's what caused some of the uh the weakness in his body i got there about three o'clock and stayed with him till about 10 o'clock at night and it was about 6 30 7 o'clock before they got him a bed to test and see what was going on so for some hours we didn't know what was causing the weakness and all but um by about eight o'clock he was beginning to respond well and talk standing up on his own and they took a scan of his his head to make sure it was no injury of his body see if he didn't break any bones but like i said about eight o'clock he was a lot more like dad so we uh we got the word out to some of the brothers we didn't know what to say yet before we would put it out to the church and after the full examination the doctors were confident to let him go home and that it was caused by having covered so got home about 10 30 and when i spoke to him yesterday he was able to take a shower on his own and walk around and all so appreciating the grace of god and he turned 86 on on wednesday and we know that to god that is nothing but mama being legally blind there's not a lot she can do to help at times but my brother does live next door my younger brother so he was there and my older brothers retired so they were able to come and by the time dad went home he was he was a whole lot more like dad and today and yesterday speaking with him um he was doing much better but he said they're going to stay home this week just to be on the safe side and be listening in so i just thank the lord for his grace and for his mercy so since work had been quite so busy and get home late and get leaving sometimes at 5 30 in the morning getting home getting home at six sometimes 6 30 in the evening the yard had gone to a place that was quite quite overgrown all so i put myself to cleaning the yard and i ended up spending five hours yesterday doing everything including going out cleaning the whole alley behind because nobody else would do it and i about passed out um i went to stand up and if i hadn't grabbed something i would have been flat on my face and the only one home was my daughter elizabeth at that time she thought maybe i had a heat stroke but i think it was my blood sugar my salt had dropped it took about a half an hour to recover but thank the lord i'm here this morning so i've made the decision that i can't do five hours of hard work like that i didn't realize the effect on it but this morning we got up and felt felt much better and thank the lord for that and just asked us the lord to to help us to pay attention sometimes i got to get it done i got to get it done there's always tomorrow sometimes so thank the lord for his mercy and his grace to us so if you'll stand with me you have a need lord i i raised my hand and i've raised my hands many of times lord but you've never failed you've never failed how many knows that that he's the unfailing god lord we thank you this morning that we can gather

requests for the the young people going back to school lord and in such a day in an age lord where just so much it happens but you are greater than any event that could ever take place lord for you watch over them lord and maybe not a single one of them ever feel that they're left alone but lord that they would know your presence goes with them lord father for each hand raised for our sister amelia's unspoken request lord and lord who those who maybe didn't write anything or even didn't raise their hand lord today would you minister to each one lord we thank you for that in jesus christ's

blessed people lord god that we have you we have your presence not just a doctrine not just a story not just a myth or an imagination not just a religion lord as thousands and millions gather in buildings lord and they come to lord some of them just to a religion just out of a religious duty or because it's what mom or dad or grandparents did lord but you've placed a reality inside of each one of us today lord and we don't serve you lord we're not gathered here based upon duty lord but because you've put something inside of our heart that hungers and thirst for you as david said i

the house of the lord with you amen if you have your bible we'll turn to the book of romans chapter 7 thank you amen for all that good worship and singing amen it's certainly a privilege to be back here in tucson and just to be able to be here and be a part amen to join in the fight that's why i'm here this morning amen just jumping right in the ditch uh with you right in the foxhole roll it up my sleeves will you roll yours up with me this morning and say lord i'm gonna i'm a soldier in the army of the lord you know i think every every time i preach and and you study and you prepare for a sermon and then you come and minister it's almost like a boxing match with the devil and you're always in a struggle and always in a war you're in a war uh before uh in in preparation and sometimes you get in the war on the way to church they call it the sunday scramble and uh the devil if he's ever gonna uh fight you to be on when you're on the way to church amen to disrupt but uh y'all got the same enemy i got right i'm not the only one amen but i'm here today to let the devil know i might have got knocked down but i'm getting back up amen and i'm rolling up my sleeves and i'm here to win amen praise the lord well we want you to turn to romans chapter 7 i just want to bring a prayer request to you and also just share a little testimony that i gave maybe briefly last time i was here just a prayer request that came to me just before this morning just coming out uh from someone that maybe some of you know uh brother michael bailey back in tennessee and his daughter caroline they just diagnosed with hodgkin's lymphoma cancer she's only i think 23 22 23 years old a wonderful family there they go to brother donnie reagan's church back in elizabethton tennessee good friends of ours and family of families at our church and so the brother just asked me to put a prayer request in where i was speaking today so if you remember in your prayer sister caroline bailey diagnosed with cancer and so we believe that jesus is still the great physician how many believers we have here today amen i shared with you a testimony last time i was here of a man and i'll just i'll just read it i actually wrote it out to a brother when the brother texted me that i said let me just share your little testimony and i gave a piece of this to be all right if i just tell that just for a moment back in march uh i was asked by a brother in our church but the travis you know brother travis from the time he visited here and gave his testimony i was asked by brother travis if i would go with him to lay hands and pray for a good friend of his marcus humphrey who had been recently diagnosed with stage four hodgkin's lymphoma cancer the same exact thing that sister caroline the doctors have given a diagnosis of and he was told he only had i think four months it was just a few months to live marcus is the associate pastor of what they call a vineyard church here in buford it's an evangelical church non-denominational he was brother travis's pastor before he came to the message more than 14 years ago the last church is going to you'll know why i'm saying this in a moment the last church in his search for truth that he went to was this vineyard church and marcus had a great impact in his life we went to his home uh where i could tell this is back in april or sometime in that that area that time frame we went to his home where i could tell immediately he was very sick and had a tumor the size of a large grapefruit on his neck brother travis told him that because of his death sentence there was no time to mince words but to be bold and very honest with him and i had met marcus maybe six months prior to this i'd met him you know big tall strong healthy uh he was he's probably in uh he's 70 years young 69 years young but he's real tall healthy uh you know guy real health consciences and and so i'd met him and now seeing him it was just immediately a quite quite a shock that i had you could tell this massive tumor uh was on his neck so brother travis just began there in his living room when we entered in it was not exactly he wasn't you know on a hospital but he's in his living room eating lunch he had another family there in his church from his church that were with him a man and a woman uh and the woman had lost her son to cancer when he was 16 and so she was a real advocate for cancer research and fighting cancer and so we came into this this you know in his living room there and told him we were coming and uh and it you know maybe not the most ideal setting not knowing the man and the woman not knowing the situation brother travis just began to testify and he said brother he said marcus i'm just gonna speak very straight not to hurt your feelings but i'm going to be real honest you know the doctors have because he had just begin to tell us how that you know he knows he's got to die at some point if this is the way it goes and doctors i think had given him four months and so i tell you what there's not a person with bolder faith that i know than brother travis and uh i said afterwards i said man if i was ever in a foxhole i'd want you right at my back just real bold and honest and uh and and but but a wonderful spirit so let me clarify a wonderful loving spirit that travis has on him and so brother travis just begin to testify uh how the lord led him to the truth of the end time message and to the living god who is still alive and living amongst his people he boldly declared to him that the true jesus wasn't living in his denomination denominational church amongst false doctrines like the trinity he mentioned but that god has revealed himself again in the last day through a prophet and restored the original apostolic gospel paul's message with apostolic past power to heal the sick and to raise the dead he shared how this was the fulfillment of scripture and malachi and marcus was very receptive as i'm sure anyone told that they only have four months to live would be and told us when travis after he got done testifying he said now marcus i don't say any of that to to offend you and he says travis he says you you didn't offend me at all he said in fact when you knocked on the door a voice spoke to me and said these are men sent from the lord and he said so before you came up my stairs i already said whatever they have to say lord i'll receive and so immediately when he said that i just felt the presence of the lord right then in that living room dropped down and and he shared how this was the fulfillment told us when we walked through the door lord to him we were sent from right i began to talk to him so after travis shared his testimony i just began to speak and all i did was take a the book that brother branham uh preaches what cancer is and it's titled healings wonderful book and i just began to share the same principles about how the prophets spoke and said that that life that's there is is a uh is a you can be seated i'm sorry i shouldn't hold you stand it i know some of you are leaning over just going to take just another minute but i shared with him how brother branham showed that that tumor was just a life it was a vehicle it was a body it was just the body housing a spirit and brother adam references mark chapter 9 when jesus spoke to the dead deaf and dumb spirit and jesus said i rebuke thee thou deaf spirit he didn't say disease didn't say what the doctors they've looked scientifically they've called it this but jesus said thou spirit thou deaf spirit to come out of the man and don't enter him again and brother branham uses that and said see a cancer is just a life that's living off of your life it's just a there's a spirit it's a demon spirit doctors have given in the name we know that but it's cancer so i'll just begin to testify uh to him about this and i told him when i pray for you i'm not gonna be praying for the tumor itself but i'm gonna be speaking to the life that's living behind the tumor as the doctor and i said marcus doctors have looked with you with all of their tools and they've they've they've used the best of theirs research and if they could use their tools to get the cancer out of you wonderful but i come with a different tool bag today and i said and i'm gonna i'm gonna speak and we're gonna call on the name of jesus and the blood of jesus who you've preached and you've lived for and you've served and given your life i remind him about hezekiah when he's given a death sentence and the bible says he prayed that god would add years and because of hezekiah's life that he had been a servant to the lord god adds years to the end of his life and so it is testified to him and then i begin to show him and testify about sister elena but sue many of you may not know but may know her testimony from brother tim pruitt's church there in louisiana and how that she was diagnosed also with stage four hodgkin's lymphoma and mary marcus's wife had just showed me on her phone marcus's pet scan full of cancer so i said elena also had the same pet scan and i pulled it up it matched exactly hers and she looked at it and i said here it is and i said you see the cancer she said yes i said this was after prayer and i showed her the pet scan that was 100 percent clean and you could see tears begin to grip her and marcus and they just began you could feel just the faith in the room raise up i said no god's no respecter of persons and i said and and and and the sister the woman there said well are you saying that he has to be healed if my son and i said no no no i'm not saying that but i'm going to tell you that we're believers and there's there's there's promises in the bible that are applicable and apply to you and and has begun to minister there for maybe 25 minutes and you could just feel as faith begin to rise we laid hands on him and begin to pray with him and i just in my prayer reminded the lord lord just as you gave hezekiah extending his life here this man has preached has stood for you has testified not been ashamed of you and i just began to pray and that god would supernaturally deliver him and heal him of this cancer demon that was killing him and so i prayed we left a month two months pass and i know that he's going to be you know uh we were sort of waiting for a report in my living room maybe two months about two months later brother travis just happened to be at my house it stopped in and we were speaking and he i remember in the living room he pulled out his phone and his eyes got about this big and he said and you could tell his breath was just taken away he said mary just texted me and capitals praised the living god marcus has been supernaturally healed and is 100 percent cancer free the doctor said it was the most aggressive cancer he's ever seen and then it miraculously was gone praise the lord that's our god the doctor said the doctor cried and cried mary's texting she said the doctor cried and said marcus this truly is a miracle we just found out last week that man marcus took his doctor to a san nats which is a minor league baseball team in savannah georgia with thousands of people got behind the microphone and for 40 minutes with his doctor beside him testified about a living god and how god healed him of cancer now if god could do that for that man how much more could he do it for sister carolyn bailey amen could you stand to your feet could you give the lord another hand clap of praise he's worthy he's the same come on friends give him a real hand clap of praise he's worthy of it amen so you be in prayer for that be in prayer for us as we go to visit him he's been uh we've been de waiting because of his he's getting the strength back but we're going to go and witness to him further and just believe that god's going to do something romans chapter 7 amen we just want to continue uh here this morning and i know that we have an evening service so we'll try to pull the parachute when we get about just a little ways in and feel like it's a good time good to see all of your faces amen good to be in the family of god aren't you glad to be a part i spoke the last time i was here and i'm going to take just a skip from that just a thought right along the same lines i spoke entitled being changed and i've ministered this in five parts uh took my title from brother branham when in standing in the gap when he says that the note that he puts there for brother roy who had the dream and he said me being changed so i spoke on being changed i'm going to speak to you i'm going to title this the real you the real you let's just begin in romans chapter 7 and let's just begin verse 17. now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me now i'm just going to take a moment to lay some teaching groundwork so you know right where i'm at this morning i want you to key in on this word me because we're going to speak on the real you and so there's a complexity to you that is deeper than what you see in the mirror and when you understand that it helps you understand the attack of the devil in your life when you understand you better and you understand the way that you're made up that there's a there's a complexity to a believer that's not just what we see every day and not what you deal with every day and what you look in the mirror but there's more to you than you and let me just make a statement i'm going to say this and it's going to maybe be a little bit paradoxical the holy ghost when the holy spirit by the true new birth comes into your life it changes everything the bible said who's ever in christ is a new creation creation he's a new creature so the holy ghost changes everything but the holy ghost doesn't change everything now it's a little bit paradoxical but just hold on with me don't throw any stones yet the holy ghost changes everything but it doesn't change everything there's a part of you that has been changed there's a part of you that is being changed and one day the holy ghost will change everything hallelujah paul caught it the down payment the earnest when the fullness of adoption to wit the redemption of the body we know that hasn't taken place now let's look here i know that verse 17 that is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me now notice the parentheses here and if you have a scofield or a king james bible that is in my flesh so paul makes a distinction there's a complexity here it's not just as simple as saying sin dwelleth in me but i'm going to clarify that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law when i would do good evil evil evil right here in your mind in your human spirit is with me for i there's another part of me for i delight in the law of god this is my delight david said as my portion how many believers could testify this is what i delight in for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law and my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members a wretched man what a good description a wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god and paul i thank god too through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin lord we just raise our hands as a body of believers here asking lord god we just want to say lord we're we're ready to receive what you have for us lord i pray that you would give us good ground good soil lord that could bring forth the fruit of christ in our life that's our prayer lord may your word lord it's a seed may it fall in good ground this morning be with every heart with the sick and the afflicted in mind body and spirit may you touch them this morning we ask it lord for sister carolyn bailey lord we just know that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord you're the same today as you was when you healed marcus the same when you healed elena lord and you're the same god here today for sister carolyn lord i pray that you would touch her in a supernatural way we join our faith together with thousands around the world praying for her right now now come and touch us lord this morning for we're in great need of you we ask it in jesus christ's name and and the church said amen you can be seated i know that in me i'm gonna just take you straight to your powerpoint brother jordan if you have that and you can go ahead and display that brother branham's answers this question and the man asked this question in uh in questions and answers in 1964 and the man asked the question and he references romans 7 the portion that we just read and i want you to notice the very last line there on your screen is his question after quoting romans 7. this i cannot understand let me just kind of polish it up so you can see in me is two persons right one wants me to do wrong the other wants me to do and the prophet's gonna say right and every time i start to do right then the wrong hinders me how many of you people on the interviews this afternoon has run that same thing incredible insight to something we don't have on tape but the prophet begins to tell how that in private interviews people were struggling with the same exact question i've been born of the spirit i believe that i've been changed i believe that god has completely changed me but somehow i still struggle to have the victory and how many believers would be honest and say brother branham i got the same question this morning how many of you running the same problem this afternoon is run the same thing this morning see notice we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we are spirit we are a spirit man now the prophet takes time and he uses in greatest battle of her fault and if you study that message it's just so so wonderful gives you good ammunition for the devil because you realize in that message that the greatest battle that you face is not just calling yourself a believer because we all can do that this morning the greatest battle you ever face won't even be to get to church but the greatest battle you'll ever face is believing what the word has said about you with real genuine faith the greatest battle ever fault the prophet says you're made up of body which is a which is made up of five senses what you see what you hear what you taste what you feel what you smell and then beyond that he draws a circle and says and inside of that body you have a human spirit and that spirit has five senses memory conscience reasoning imaginations affections and then beyond that realm is a little realm called the soul and the prophet says it this way that's the real you in other words what you see on the outside what you see on the inside of the spirit and what you see on the soul that real true seed gene of god that god placed in you before the foundation of the world that's the real you and that real part of you really loves the word of god that part of me believes the word of god that part of me stands with the word of god that part of me has faith in the promises of god it's this part of me that gives me so much trouble so within that complexity of the human spirit brother adam says you have memory conscience reasoning imagination affection and he says and in there you have channels and he says and then what happens to so many blowed up christians as they never clear out the channels and he says just like a boiler and a water heater and he says then the flu gets clogged up and it's clogged up in its memory and its imagination and its bitterness and jealousies and envies and fears and phobias and all kinds of things that are bottled up into what make you which are based upon your life's experiences and brother branham says but god not only does he have to clean sin out of your soul and i'm so glad we have an atonement to where he can clean sin out of me but also you've got to let the holy spirit come and clean your memory come and clean your conscience come and clean your imaginations your affections how many can say lord i want your holy spirit to clean every part of me so that there's no hindrance to believe the word so there's a part of you notice what he says here and inside that is faith in god's word then we bring our outside body under subjection that's an important word to the word by faith by how accepting what god said how can i take a cocker barrel and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cocklebur has been transmitted from a cockleboro weed a cockaboard to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cockle burr and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in the cockle borer and the life of the cockleboro has been taken out notice but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been i love those words has fully been this is how the prophet answers this question romans 7. in inside of you is two people and when you get the baptism of the holy ghost that doesn't change unless your body's changed how many here have new bodies maybe by a show of hand nobody you still got aches still got pain still get headaches still sleepy fight sleep in church when the preacher's preaching still struggle with the with the things of the world how many be honest brother branham says here's this here's the key your nature has been changed on the inside but the outside is still sticky and you say when will it not be sticky until this new life has been fully has fully been developed so what is happening right now when you believe the word of god is you serve the lord you're being developed from this to what's inside of here say brother matt what what what do i got to do add to your faith knowledge add to your knowledge virtue add to your knowledge under your virtue temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness jesus the bible says let this mind which was in christ be in you that means you've got a choice to allow the things of god to dwell in you and you feed upon those things he says it's fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth now he's speaking of the resurrection he's speaking of the body change then it's no more cocklebur but wheat but while it's here on earth and out of the earth because the curse was upon the earth and a cocklebur it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live when will it not bother me brother matt when you turn 18 for the second time yeah now let's you're catching it when you when you turn 18 19 years old for the second time then it won't be bothering you anymore but we shall know him as we are known paul said i know we know not what we shall be but we know this when he doth appear we shall be like him in his very image well i'm looking forward to that day and he says it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the end no no but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin is gone from you that's the thing i love that somebody told me this is the the old indian chief i'm just going to skip just to save time we're going to go through some of these this is when brother branham tells the story the white dog the black dog which one wins let's just skip down here and he said he said said well chief which one of them wins the fight that depends on which one chief feeds the most so i think that's a good answer here there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of god that does it you know we make overcoming a lot more complicated than it has to be it's really that simple whichever one you cater to the most so there's a part of you i'm going to read a quote here in a moment i'm just going to reference it here brother brandon says when a man's born he's born with a hole in his heart he's born with a void that needs to be filled and he says and then the lord begins to give him we're going to spend time on just a moment but he says the lord begins to give him a mother and he feels the love of that mother and then a father and he fills that place but even after that person is born of the spirit of god as romans 7 i know romans 8 that he that there now is no condemnation to them which are in christ which walk not after the flesh but after the spirit i understand when you're born of the spirit of god you're a changed person you're a new creation old things are dead all things are become new but yet there's still a part of you that is being changed and let me just stop here and say you cannot stop you cannot pause i don't care how far the lord has brought you in christ in maturity you're in need of something to be changed this morning you've got to constantly be changing a holy ghost-filled christian born of the spirit of god can still struggle with things he struggles with him you know what he's struggling with himself he's struggling with that part of him that's not been changed and oftentimes what hides the real problem is pride oftentimes in a marriage when there's a man and a woman and there's struggle and there's fightings and there's warrants usually the real problem the real cause is covered over and hidden in plain sight because of pride and if someone a believer especially could just lay down their pride swallow their pride and recognize it and admit it's not my brother it's not my sister it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer the zilla of the hour to say i'm wrong i repent notice this this is martin luther i am more afraid of my own heart than of the pope and all his cardinals i have within me the great pope self listen to what brother madam says you know who the biggest enemy i got is william branham he's always in god's way if i can just get him out of the way then god can go to work that's your worst enemy is yourself just get yourself out of the way and then god can go to work power of decision 1955 you find out you're the biggest enemy you've got if i could get william branham out of the way jesus can have a wonderful time if we'd be honest here this morning we'd say the same thing we'd swallow our pride and say if i could just get myself out of the way jesus could have a wonderful time in my children and my marriage and my home and my health and my job but my biggest enemy is me can you say amen the interval and a man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's complete he's completely overcome who himself man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's completely overcome who himself that's the biggest enemy you got is your self that's the reason you can't rise up in faith because of little bugs and little things you take covet as just a a thing that's just the fear of it uh more than you know people today never maybe you got sick with cover there's other been people who have died from it but there's been others who've never really been affected by the disease in a great way still here today maybe you've had covert three or four times and took a vaccine three or four times but you still got covet you know people maybe never you never really were severely affected by covid the disease but the fear of a pandemic you ingested in your human spirit and it's done more damage than the disease ever could well it's true because you ingest things into your human spirit all the way from the time you're a little boy a little girl remember i made the statement last time uh that i was here your adult life is mostly a reaction to your childhood when you understand that it's real it's very liberating your adult life is mostly just a reaction to your childhood things that you experienced that you never should have and now they affect you in a marriage or in a father and a mother to a child the things that you did experience the things that you didn't maybe love and affection that you should have received or nurtured that you never did and now you grow up you cover that over and you cover that over you're born of the spirit of god you meet the lord jesus you get filled with the baptism of the holy ghost but still inside that human spirit still inside of that nature still inside of that subconscious there's a there's a an issue maybe something a disease spiritually that you've taken on it's still there and when people step on that pain ouch and it hurts so you see you're made up more than just you more than just what meets the eye the biggest enemy you got is yourself right this one brother branham says i want to ask you something how many in here knows you've got a subconscious don't you read it again i want to ask you something how many in here ever ever you know you've got a subconscious don't you we are conscience of that that's the fellow that subconscious is causing you all the trouble tonight it don't agree with this one out here it gets scared and backs up but when it becomes in harmony with this one i believe brother adam's preaching about the seed when it comes in harmony with this one and this one becomes in harmony with god's word you're going then so the trouble is what's in your conscience what's in your subconscious the things that you've taken in that's why that's why that thing bothers you that doesn't bother her and that's why that thing bothers you that doesn't bother him you're different you're complex you're made up of all of your experiences when you're born of the spirit of god what changes brother branham and future home paints it out on the board draws it out the snake that's inside of the heart that old nature and he says that man is calling pushing the buttons he's like the little man down on the ship a massive cruise ship but inside of that cruise ship is a little bitty tiny room and inside of that little tiny room is just a little bitty man and he's pulling the lever and he's pushing the buttons and that entire ship is turning based upon his commands and brother branham says when you're not when you before you're born again baptism of the holy ghost that little man is a nature that you're born with the carnal nature and he's calling the shots but when you receive the holy spirit that snake is removed and the lamb the dove of god the holy spirit comes in and dwells in the human heart upon the throne room of the heart you remember the story but the brother tells about brother and when he references the picture the old indian nature behind him and and he uses the example that when you he says when the holy ghost comes into your heart he says it burns out that old nature it burns out and he says and that that that snake that was on the heart that spirit that that that that that spirit that was reigning that was ruling your life that was on the throne of your heart and he says now he's removed and jesus is on the throne of your heart but what happens to that spirit that was on the throne of your heart he moves from the throne of the heart and he moves to a place of influence and now he whispers in your ear you're not born again you don't have the holy ghost you don't even know the lord you're not a seed of god you're not part of the elected family of god you'll never make it oh is he am i the only one he whispers that to let me tell you something that's not jesus talking to you and you've got to learn to discern the voices and cast down the vain imaginations so he's brother madam says but what happens now now he's on the throne of the heart now jesus is there but notice brother madam deals and we we don't want to take time but he deals with a situation situation of a woman that's been told and she's heart trouble and and brother adam says it's what is it and he falls into this german you go see it on 20th century prophet and he says oh oh it's a lie someone's told a lie on you they said you were a witch that's a pastor claiming divine healing he's dealing with polio right now sister on the tape begins to cry yes that's right brother branham and he says you're not a witch you're a daughter of god and you can hear that woman immediately free and now heart trouble is free her spirit's liberated why was she not born again no she was born of the spirit of god but there was a lie that she had ingested that was told about her and it was affecting her body we gave example after example of that in the prayer line brother branham would deal with a woman who was chased by a dog when she was a little girl and now she's dealing with nervousness and a heart condition so he says that's the problem that's scared and backed up but when it becomes the harm of this one then you're going then notice what brother branham says here in america it never to work disregarded so much teaching in america so many different teachings to one has their own idea now my pastor said that a man was a spiritualist well that settles it with you oh you say i don't believe that now brother branham notice i don't believe that how many people say i don't know i i don't believe that no no that's not me but way down in that subconscious it's still there you usually move by your subconscious just like a big ship going on the sea the captain gives orders to a little man that goes down in the bowels of the ship oh you don't see nothing he just operates the way orders come from above he don't know he says steer this way turn this way full speed of head or back up he just works according to what the man does up here well usually that's the way your subconscious works it stirs you when you're up here when you're trying to think this you're trying to believe the word of god but way down in here there's something else moves you now i know that i've caught the patients by the thousands on the platform or they say brother branham i believe that with all my heart yes brother branham i believe that it's one thing to say it with your mouth it's another thing for you to say lord deliver me of all doubt and clean me of all doubt so that i can believe it here how many believe the lord can do that i've dealt with them thousands in the prayer line brother branham i believe that and yet down in there i think god if they believed it down here like they did up here it'd be different but they believe it up here but don't down here so that won't work this here will overrule that subconscious will move on can you say amen this morning notice brother brandon begins to deal with hell that you're born even even as a even as a boy now we're going to take this just for a moment prophet of god spends time and you go back to the message leadership and he starts to talk about how that you were led from a little he says when you're born you come into the world and he says and you're born into the earth he says you're led by a mother the first experience that a child has with the love of god is through a mother imagine that and he says the first love the first time that baby feels the love of god his nursing there with his mother when he's nurtured and he's taken care of he's born into this world with a hole in his heart he's born with a void and he says but that mother fills that void with the love of god fills that void with the things of god and he says then you move from that mother and you graduate maybe almost like dispensationally you move from a mother to a father and now listen what brother branham says here so of man he was made to want to be comforted that's so important we could preach a message on this he cares do you care he cares for you phoenix he was made man was made to want to be comforted so then if he doesn't accept god's way then he'll take away for himself and he'll try to substitute something to take the place of that holy spirit oh i want you to listen to it a man or a woman that will not accept i wish i could put this in neon wish i could put this in neon flashing lights listen to what brother adams is so powerful a man or a woman that will not accept the holy spirit the comforter will try to comfort themselves with some violent substitute man or a woman that will not receive the comfort of the holy spirit i want you to listen to me young people a man was made to want to be comforted brother branham tells the story of a man and this is this is i wish i had it here because it's almost too much to to just reference you need the quotes one of those quotes you really need to say show me the quote for that one by the man brother and reference is a pastor a minister and he talks about the man getting up behind the pulpit drunk and he's and he and he says he's intoxicated and he's come he says he's been named amongst us even in our church a man got up before the pulpit and he gets up before his church and he's he's he's buzzed from alcohol that's what brother madam says he's intoxicated and he preaches now what would you do had brother aaron came up here after i walked through the office door and said we found some liquor in the back there and brother matt actually came out here what would you do what would your reaction be if you knew the preacher was drinking incredible to think about brother branham says now we've criticized that man when we ought not to whoa give me some clarification here brother branham we've criticized that man when we ought not to we ought to go and find out what's missing inside of there to cause him to do that we spend so much time fighting attributes of sin we never get to the calls and he says we should have asked what happened what's happening in his life what emptiness is there that's causing a man like that to do that and you know when you get a wayward child you get a wayward situation child teenage or you get a wayward marriage or waiver at home or you just hear today feel wayward so many times the devil would love you just to chase all the symptoms but never get to the root calls of the problem and brother adam says if a man doesn't accept the comforter of the holy spirit he'll accept he'll take he said listen what he says he'll try to comfort himself that's what brother branham says in that message he says that man's trying to draw comfort from other some of the things then he goes in that same message brother brown says our sister's here that wears makeup cuts their hair and he says many times we've criticized them and we've looked down on them and he says we ought to we ought to question and wonder what's causing that they're trying to find comfort some other way they've never received the true comforter friends religion will not give you this doctrine indoctrination will not fill this void teachings good praise god we've got it but you don't need the quotes and the doctrines and the books and the tapes that we need we need all those but we need the person of the message to come and feel the void and then when that person comes in there's a life that says i want to live like that i desire to live a life that's pleasing to the lord less conformity culture of conformity and more transformity true transforming power when god transforms a life it is no more pressure to do something it's no more a pressure to come to church or to serve god it's no more fear that you're doing it but it's a relationship you have with the lord and he says with some violent substitute the same will present to them satan's just got plenty of substitutes an old buddy does he ever have substitutes today but why do we have to have a substitute when the pentecostal sky uh i didn't have it here before you apologize and he says why do we have to why do we have to have a substitute let's read it again there man made to be comforted with some violent substitute the same will presented them satan's just got plenty of substitutes why do we have to have a substitute when the pentecostal skies are full of the real why would i eat from a garbage can when a clean table sitting full of choicey food there would be something mentally wrong with me if i did that now what a pity it is to see that man will try to substitute something to take that place sometimes he'll try to ease his conscience by going out this is why children go wayward they're trying to satisfy a thirst they're trying to be comforted listen what was the matter this is this is uh i'm just going to skip that one let's go down here notice what brother madam says here what time we got we got 11 26 just give me 15 more minutes is that all right now what does he says now what does a mother now listen to what brother brandon begins to talk here because he says when you move in leadership he says you move from that mother and he says that first experience with the love of god that boy that baby has when he's born when he's born i want you to catch this when he's born into the world he has a desire he has a necessity down inside of him that god put there to made to be comforted and though you're a baby or you're 10 or you're 20 or you're 30 or you're 80 that need never goes away never changes inside of all of you today is the same need you had when you were a baby to be comforted you still have it today and if you're not accepting the comfort of the holy spirit you'll accept some violent substitute to fill it now notice what he says he says then that baby you move from that mother and you move to that father and he says now it's a little different kind of love and he says but it's still the love of god maybe a little bit more corrective brother branham says more disciplinary like brother diggs preaches in every home there's law and grace mother and father right one of them is law one of them's grace and your your children will find out which one of you is law then they'll go to grace and say mommy can i do this brother diggs mom was a security officer he said she came home every day packing a gun so she was the law literally and he says you go to that from that mother's love to a father's love and he's teaching you he's training you he's passing down traits honor and character and integrity and honesty and and and and he's given you his teaching brother adam says then you move from that father and maybe you graduate from there to a he says maybe a teacher sunday school teacher and he's teaching you he's instilling things in you and he says then you move from there maybe to an employer maybe a boss you go from there into your career and you're always that's why it's so important let me just say this brother adam takes a moment to show that from the mother teaching to the father teaching to the pastor teaching the sunday school teacher to the career to the employer to the school teacher it is so important what teachers you have in your life that's why we don't just become impressionable to anybody that's why we be careful about who what influences we subject our children to or ourselves to hello it's important brother branham says then you move from teacher to teacher to teacher and the first love that that baby feels i love that so much is the first love of christ listen to me mothers and fathers i just want to stop and say you we have the ability to transmit the love of god through us to our children or we have the ability to transmit our complexes our bitternesses our weaknesses we have the ability to to transmit those kind of things i just want to say lord clean me so much to where i transmit the nature and the love of christ to all of those around me how many want that here today and say lord let me transmit the true character of christ and not myself not my complex not my temper not my personality unless my personalities the personality of jesus now what does a mother with a little baby when he's sick and fretting she picks up the little fella she holds him to her breast and she nurses the the mother strengthened to his own body through the breast not only is he satisfied or he's quietened he's screaming to the top of his voice he's all disturbed but when the mother picks him up and puts her he says when the mother picks him up and puts her on her breast he begins to haul she begins to hum to him and rock him back and forth he feels his mother his head is on her bosom and he begins to nurse and draw the strength from his mother into his body he's rejuvenating himself building up strength and also satisfied while day by day he's growing stronger and stronger just as a baby nurses and gets strength you are to nurse from jehovah that same need to be comforted god can fill that need for you this morning you're to nurse from jehovah and say lord i want you to feel for every part of my being my body my soul my spirit let me receive strength from you this morning lord and let me draw from that and not a substitute you can't do that until you have love perfect love cast out all fear if i want to contribute anything to my success in the ministry amongst people if there's one thing is because that i have loved people and people knows that when you love someone they know that when you care for someone they feel that you take a little baby three months old he don't know nothing he's got a mind but it isn't developed you don't know who or nothing the doctors say they can see a light might see your hand but they can only follow it and he will just be kicking his little heels and screaming to the top of his voice well here comes some kind woman comes along past and he'll say well well dear he just kicks right on he don't know who the woman is he don't know nobody listen i want you just to don't think here for a moment i'm just showing you a powerful principle that from the time you're a little baby you don't change you get older you mature you get married you have children of yourself but there's a necessity there's a comforter that you always need are you here this morning there's a part of you the real you that needs to feed upon that that needs to nurse from that that needs to draw strength from that receiving the holy ghost is wonderful but the experience with god is not a one-time experience it's a daily experience with the lord it's a daily as paul said dying it's a daily death to self and a daily resurrection of the word inside of my life kicking to the top here comes a little woman he don't know her he don't know who the woman is he don't know nobody but let that mother walk up just put her hands on him that settles it now he don't know his mother listen now he don't know his mother but his little spirit knows there's something about that spirit that nothing else can inject that mother's love to him you might seek for all of the answers to your problem in the world and i'm so thankful for the voices of good godly men who i could counsel with and ask i'm thankful for good godly friends who i can speak to and and get advice from and say pray for me i love all of that i'm thankful for that but friends there's nothing like the voice of the lord when it's his voice that speaks that settles it for me oh how we need that voice to speak no matter how much the other person loves it ain't the mother's love is that right she lays their hands on him he'll dry up see he's ready because that mother there's a love about her that goes to that baby that the baby's little spirit recognizes that's a love that no other love is mother is so great you know the first one that receives you in life this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she bares you under her heart she's the first to know you the first two in this life to hold you then when you're born she's the one on the first hand that touch you and wipes back the tears of you out of your eyes she's the first one to pat you and to love you and to coo over you and this life is your mother now i think that there's not enough honor that we could give to a mother mother is the first with the child and she's a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has the responsibility from god to place that child on the right road and i think that's why mothers has a special little touch thankful for godly mothers of a boy in the city i think his mother's present now he's almost my age i don't say this to hurt the mother because she has enough hurts as all mothers what a statement because no one will hurt you deeper than your own children she has enough mothers listen to this but the boy drinks he drinks heavy gets real drunk he'll come home and jump in the bed with his mother put his arms around her he's got grandchildren but there's something about just the pad of a mother that seems to take a different place than anything else can touch that is in this life humanly speaking you know a man like moses if i could give credit anything to his character it was because he had a god-sent mother i'm saying all this for a reason to stick with me here the comfort that you receive brother adam says or he'll fill up he'll fill that void with a violent substitute listen to influence tell you i think today we have such juvenile crime wave across the nation but i think i really think it started in the home i think that parents begin to let go and if the child had been raised up in a good old-fashioned godly home i don't say it would be all over certainly not that means no matter how good your home is no matter how good you raise them that doesn't mean they're going to turn out perfect hello is this tucson tabernacle still awake today we need to preach to the streaming audience that doesn't mean that when you do everything right you may do everything right and still get a a bad situation right you may do everything right brother madam says i don't say that he says i don't say it be all over certainly not go if it had been raised in the good old godly home i don't say it'd be all over certainly not but it certainly give that child the right kind of influence i think many times you say brother matt then what does it mean it means that your children just remember this there's a part of them that's the real theme and then there's a part of them that's the struggling part with the things of the carnal nature and the carnal word don't ever let the devil get your eyes so fixed on the on that situation that you miss the true seed gene down inside of the heart and when you pray and you have faith you pray to that seed that god placed in them before the foundation of the world i don't say it would be all over i think many times homes the children have been brought up wrong turn loose on the street just live for themselves while the mother stays in a bar room the father and so forth they don't take care of this child another thing they don't love it and give it the affections to take it up it's young you've got to teach it to love and respect and to read the bible the lady was born god had a provided way i love this the lady was born in that nervous condition her mother and father died when she was a baby child baby raised up just tossed about everywhere never had the proper love and care the baby has you know mother i want to tell you something i know i got a little boy back there and he's really rankly spoiled but i would rather have him that way listen i would rather have him that way i believe it'll make a better man out of him if god lets him live than to let him scream and cry and upset his little self listen a few years ago some normal modern witch doctor said that let the baby cry don't pick it up that'll all things like that don't let grandma touch it you know what they hatched out you see what it is a juvenile delinquency a bunch of neurotics god made a baby to be loved that's why he made a mother to love a baby that's why we're supposed to be this way god made it that way and anytime you upset god's program you must remember you're wrong and you will be wrong as long as you're upsetting god's program follow god's program do it the way god said do it he goes to job had a bunch of daughters and sons when they knew they were out like birds people raised up children today i feel sorry for fathers and mothers today being a parent myself no in one reason i'm trying to get my children away from our city we don't have any christian schools there and i want to get them somewhere they'll be brought up in school in a real fundamental school where they learn to love the lord so what is the prophet saying you are teaching your children something whether you are teaching them or not you're teaching them whether you're actively teaching them how to love the lord teaching them how to worship the lord teaching them how to praise the lord you say well i'm just not going to teach them you're teaching them whether you want to or not and he says i'm teeth the teaching that i can give them to he says to love the lord the teaching that i can give them around home yet they get out there in that worldly crowd the devil is a shrewd felon he pushes that into them if you keep them under the hall under the spirit until they get old enough to receive the holy ghost and know what it's all about then god will take care of the rest of it i say lord help us to keep our homes under the spirit how many parents how many mothers how many fathers how many i don't care who you are today whether you have children or don't have children you could raise a hand and say lord let my home be a home where the spirit of the lord dwells where he's comfortable where he's where he's worshipped and he says until they get along the lord he says the lord god will take care of the rest of it but first they've got to get a little adolescent days now every person thinks of their children while they're under your wings you can watch them but once out from under the wings then the devil's got every little oscar he can out there to associate with your children that's infidelic and mean and devilish and everything else god help us god help us i'm just going to read just got a few more this the holy spirit gave this to me before coming out and i just i'm going to obey him this morning what brought out juvenile delinquency was parent delinquency was parent delinquency the parent failing to take care of the children you remember a few years ago when my boy was born that he's been about i think about 19 now i remember the doctor told my wife said just let that kid squall said it ain't going to hurt him and if grandma comes along to pick him up take her keep her hands off of him said he ought to be in the he ought to be crib broke at six months old now you know better than that sounds like a talking of a witch doctor instead of a real doctor you know what it hatched out i hatched out a bunch of neurotics and a bunch of gangsters listen god gave you that baby to love i don't care how bad you spoil it love it anyhow i hope so i hope you're catching it's not just about mothers loving a baby that void is always there we are to be people if there was anybody in the world who could transmit the love of god to everyone around us it should be believers i said this back home and i'll just repeat it it is not an attribute of a christian to be rude i may have to get sneaked behind this pulpit and say that again it is not the attribute of a christian to be rude in fact the opposite it is the attribute of a real believer to be kind the bible says that be kindly affectionate one to another you know those be kind bars they're biblical come on laugh it's okay to laugh be kind to bars you should eat more of them be kind be kind kindness has left the world but it shouldn't leave the body of christ we should be trans you're transmitting something you're either transmitting your complexes you're transmitting your tempers you're transmitting your your pet peeves you're transmitting your irritations your idiosyncrasies you're transmitting and you're giving that out or you're saying lord clean me of all of that i don't want to transmit and project that and let me pray transmit and project the love of christ and the nature of christ and the joy of christ how many can say that let it project out from me clean out my channels so that the real me is what people see let my family see it before anybody else sees it have kindness in the home before we have kindness out in public let the love of god dwell in our houses and our relationships how many want that i do he says god gave you that baby to love i want you to catch this god to love i don't care how bad you spoil it uh love it anyhow that's right love it if you don't love it now it'll grow up in a cold home and indifferent it'll seek love somewhere or something it'll make an out light listen it'll make an outline for somewhere mother take that baby and give it fellowship and love now make it a part of you which it is and act like it and hug it and kiss it and love it don't be too cold with the things of the world god gave you that as a treasure raise it right amen notice what's the matter we got away from the things of god you get away from nature and then you're out of the will of god now i want you to notice job thinking of his children he said prayer adventure the god they might sin so he offered the only preparation that he knowed it was a burnt off sacrifice set in the blood and he shed the blood of a lamb for his children making preparation if they did sin you see it job was mindful of his children to make a preparation for their sin and mother and father if we would quit spending money on our children learning tap dancing and things like that and some kind of how to be an actor and put more time of pleading the blood of jesus over them and showing them love and fellowship we'd get along better the child would too i just went through the experience with my rebecca see just committed to god when she got to be a little teeny and she was going with some girl when we first went out there going run over to some girl's house taking music lessons this girl i'll come by one day and hear this girl was sitting there at the piano playing rock and roll well that was just enough for me so i told her stay away from over there see i've seen it one time that was enough and i told her stay away then she said well it's the only place i got to take music you know what teenies get i said every kid has to go through that practically everyone goes through that age you did i did and i love this and we've got to think their thoughts i love that statement i read someone posted and i just have saved it be to your children be who you needed when you were their age we've got to think their thoughts so then a few days after the mother after her listen so then a few days after that her mother got after her for something and she sashed her now that's not rebecca at all took off and slammed the door almost knocked the things off the wall went to school now i ought to have seemingly just taken my belt off and followed her out in the yard and brought her back with warps around her see but i thought wait a minute i got to thank 18 year old thoughts see you see how important it is to always be controlled by the holy spirit hello sale important is to always in your reactions that are not your actions that get you in trouble it's your reactions it's always important to think and be controlled and tempered be moderated by the holy spirit brother adam says hold on hold on i should have grabbed a belt but hold on i gotta think 18 year old thoughts i said mother i know that she started crying me too i said i know you've done all you can do i've done all i can do now if it's out of our hands we have to take the next step i said well look honey now you've got to listen to me it's hard for you to do this i'm your husband but people drive across the nation and around just for a few words of advice now i talked to her the other day and she just walked away from me now becky never did do that to me see and when her mother said something about it she slammed the door and say you expect me to sit here and be a wallflower all my life and blammy she slammed the door and went out that was i didn't hear you let's read it again she went out blaming she slammed the door and that was you mean it wasn't her wasn't the real her you mean there's a part of you that you could manifest that's not the real you that was the devil i remember the first two years of her life she cried we'd go into a restaurant to eat i'd walk her on the street while mita ate and then she'd walk her a while and i just cried and cried and one day up here in canada cried all night i couldn't rest and everything me standing there now and something said to me it's the devil getting at your ministry i said hand me that baby i said satan in the name of jesus christ you take your hands off of her she stopped right then and never cried no more she's the quietest kid i got from that very hour it was gone notice you have to get that you have to have that in you though before you can do it meet about an hour i said meeta take your hands off me that's my kid i said isn't it mine too all right not often you get to read an argument a spat between a prophet and his wife said that's my kid i said isn't it mine too all right i said if she was dying this morning you'd have to commit her to god for her eternal destination why can't we commit her to god now for her earthly journey she said well that's my kid i said it's mine too i said now can you take your mean not say nothing to her i said i never said that well quit scolding her just advise her she needs a buddy and you're the one to be her buddy you and i were her parents these kids today need a buddy if they had a mother and father would stay home and take care of them instead of out here in a bar room running all overnight things like that wouldn't have a juvenile delinquent cc they got away from the bible they all went to church and made a bunko games and things like that see you're trying to polish up like satan's ground out of hollywood you could never bring hollywood into the church i mean bring the church into hollywood you've got to bring hollywood to your grounds see not go on their grounds let them come over here we've got something they know nothing about so we there got down on our knees and committed it to god i said i know she's 18 years old we'll be in a few days and she's a girl that age will think about boyfriends and we've kept her in i said i never wanted to see her get married i want to put her in the office here and do the work how many dads could identify with that told my daughter that you're never getting married you made a contract with you when you were born i never wanted her to see her get married i want to put in the office do the work i want to see her filled i love this i want to see her filled with the spirit oh how i could identify with that and say if there's anything more i could ask to say lord fill my children with the baptism of the holy ghost oh you could raise a hand this morning if that's your desire i don't care how old they are today say lord i want you to fill them with the holy spirit oh how i wanted to see her filled with the spirit notice his ambitions is not to go to college and to get a career oh i just wanted to see her get wealthy in the world and get successful and just i could sit back and listen their families today that's their pride and that's their joy maybe that's all they have in life i'm not criticizing them but that is not my ambition as a father for my children if they if they're successful that's wonderful but if anything i could give and say lord if i want you to bring them to any place let's bring them to your side get them to your throne lord we're going to close right here last one she said well we all wanted that she said well we can't do that said she just won't listen to it i said wait a minute we've raised her all we can now put her in the hands of god commit her and i said then when she does anything say becky darling mother don't want you to do that but i'm your pal i'll stick by you see let her know that you love her what a what a what a testimony let her know that you love her do you agree with it i may not agree with it but i want to project the love of christ in all that i do let her know that you love her she's going to get somebody to love her and it might be the wrong woman see i said you be the woman does the loving i said honey that sounds kind of crude but people come everywhere said on personal interviews and things i said i'm so common we're common one to another because we're husband and wife but we never let that happen you must remember this is the name of the in the name of the lord what was his desire musicians could you come what was his desire could you bow your heads with me here this morning service took a turn i didn't think it would take that's all right we just let the holy spirit do what he wants to do this morning let her know that you love her she's going to get somebody to love her might be the wrong one we're transmitters transmitters we project and that projection that we project is to our friends to our church to our family to our home and what you project what you allow say brother mad am i not born of the spirit no i'm not taking that away from you but if you're not careful the real you is not projected and instead maybe those fears and that complexes and those bad experiences and those things that you were taught that you were that were wrong those things you went through that were wrong caused you to be bitter maybe angry maybe short tempered maybe certain things in your in your maybe certain complexes that you have if you're not careful in your home you project all of those things and what you project determines your atmosphere and when you project the wrong thing you get the wrong atmosphere when you get the wrong atmosphere you get the wrong spirits when you get the wrong spirits they develop the wrong habits and they develop the wrong things and they think the wrong things old friends there's anything i could just raise my hand if someone would want to raise it with me and say lord i want to project you this morning i want you to be projected from my mind from my spirit from my mouth from my actions don't let me lord i'm made up of three parts and i need you to come in and clean out the channels this morning come and clean out my memory how many could pray that and say i've got something in my memory i want you just to clean it i want to have victory over it today i want to put it in the past and not allow it to project itself when circumstances arise and they come up and maybe a certain situation arises and i react a certain way but i don't want to do that lord i want to repent of that right now i want to project you lord so come and clean my memory oh hands up all over the building come and clean my conscience my imaginations my affections i'm reasoning i want to project jesus i don't want my personality i don't want to be a person who has my i want to i want to change my personality let me have the person of christ let me strive for that how many hands up would stand to your feet with your hands raised say lord i'm just bowing here humbly before you now humbly lord jesus i bow i've raised my hands lord now conviction is a good thing now conviction of the holy spirit it's a good thing we accept it we receive it i raise my hand and say lord i accept it this morning as your word has searched out hearts searched out minds and searched out lives of your children there's a reason that we desire these things lord it's because there's a real us one that matches the word that lives down inside of us and i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i want to bring this outward man subject i want to bring this outward conscience subject i want to bring this outward temper subject i want to bring this outward thought my eyes i want my eyes and my ears to be subject to the spirit of christ that dwell i know dwells down inside of me i want to say lord may that holy spirit that dove as your prophet described and he would say it this way that gentle humble kind loving compassionate spirit i want that dove to come and dwell in that little control room and i want him to push the buttons and i want him to pull the levers i want to go where you say go i want to speak what you say speak i want to be silent anything you don't want lord jesus i want that holy spirit to have complete control granted lord let us recognize our greatest enemy as our self in our battle in this life is mothers fathers single young teenagers elderly pastors preachers deacons all of the body of christ our battle will not be with a brother or a sister or a church or a drawing a fence here or a barrier there taking a stand here our greatest battle will be ourself lord to be overcoming that sticky nature and letting this mind which was in christ be in us i want to raise a hand lord when i say lord i surrender now to you jesus help me lord help me daily lord jesus help me lord god to project your spirit and your nature let it control the atmosphere of my home let it control the atmosphere let me be quick lord let me be quick to to stop and say lord what would you do what would you say how would you react what would you think i want to be in your footsteps i want to i want to follow after you lord i want to add to my faith virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and brotherly kindness and love lord i want that in my life i want it to be the crown of my life as you said don't don't let me be crowned as your prophet said with some old crabby spirit and somehow cranky uh irritable irritated don't the prophet said don't ever let me be crowned with that but let my life be crowned with the love of jesus flowing out from my person let it be jesus we ask let it be to each one [Music] to each home god as i lift my hands to worship and [Music] thy name flow through me holy spirit flow oh

an influence it's something that will always be there when dad got sick all of us rallied quickly together dad calls me every day rodrigo is there something i need to pray about that never goes away let it stay there i got a phone call from my insurance agent when the girls were getting their cars or i called them [Music] and i asked him one day are my girls up to date on their insurance because most of their loans were co-signed by me or grandpa and if something happened we'd be responsible and the insurance agent he said aaron he said if all the kids were like your kids we wouldn't have these problems that we have if they're going to be a day late they tell me they come and they pay for it made me very happy but as i was driving to work i said lord but how are they with you and them more so than the insurance agent how is their hearts with you are they making things right we've taught them our best and the lord took me to job some driving he says just as job laid a sacrifice every morning he goes for his children i will honor your prayers for them and made the drive to work a whole lot a lot better [Music] brother joe still works it does [Music] so i i was reading doing some studying did a word search and took a paragraph that brother brown said and i went up two or three paragraphs and read that just to get the whole meaning and brother braham said this now like any good father as job did he would lay a sacrifice for his children any good father would do that for their children [Music] oh but they're married no they're still your children you still pray for them you still hold them up before god and you be an example before your children you still can amend my heart oh god [Music] make it ever true [Music] change my heart oh god may i be like you change my heart oh god how many would honestly say that to make it ever true change my heart oh god may i be like [Music] [Music] mold me and make me this is what i pray change my heart oh god make it ever true

and you ministered to each one [Music] as fathers as mothers lord as as husbands and wives brother branham would just share that about him and sister meter lord it's no different than all of us sometimes as a mom and dad we might go to the rooms and close the door and we'll talk to each other and maybe ask why did you do that why was that your reaction i would have done it differently but lord you're still god over it all and to learn that lesson to commit commit ourselves to you lord just completely surrender and say here i am lord in whatever that situation is you know best you've already seen the end from the beginning lord you know the end result lord and sometimes we struggle through that part help us to have that rest that peace that confidence lord we dedicated our children to you right here maybe in this church somewhere else we gave them to you lord and you said in no wise would you lose one of them every one of them lord so we commit them again to you we commit ourselves to you lord our whole being lord in jesus christ's name amen god bless you this this day maybe you heard something you hadn't heard before but many of us can testify it is a truth it
