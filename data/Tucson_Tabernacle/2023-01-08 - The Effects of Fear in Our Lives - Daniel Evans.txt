[Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign thank you foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign thank you thank you foreign foreign foreign [Music] thank you thank you foreign thank you thank you I read this story I put myself in that armor Bears position and so he's going with Jonathan and he tells Jonathan brother he says whatever you have in your heart I'm with you so Jonathan says okay well here's the deal if they tell us to come up then we'll see it as a sign from God and then if they say we'll come down then we'll stand our ground I remember I wonder what that armor bear thought well what if they come down there's a bunch of those guys and they're big those guys are remember Goliath 10 feet tall these were big men Warriors and I could think the armor bear thinking uh yeah what if they come down Jonathan said we'll hold our ground we'll stay here so they they go up and there's two big rock out croppings they they go up there to that place and they stand up and they say here we are the Philistines looked down and they say oh you finally come out of your holes now why don't you come up and fight us you know that armor bear was like yes I was wondering what was going to happen so all right Jonathan let's go so Jonathan goes up and in a place about it less than an acre of land they killed 20 of these Warriors just Jonathan and his armor Bearer great victory I can imagine what they did they had to climb up the Bible says that they had to climb hand over a hand up this mountain to this Garrison come up and start finding that I love Bible so much you know I just love reading it this isn't Jedis and Stormtroopers this is real this really happened these things in this book so they go up there they beat these 20 men down and then this happens verse number 11. I'm sorry let's go to uh let's go to verse 13. and Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet and his armor Bearer after him and they fell before Jonathan and his armor bear slew after him and then that first Slaughter which Jonathan and his armor Bearer made was about 20 men within it within as it were a half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow and there was trembling this is the scripture I want you to look at and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people The Garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earthquaked so it was a very great trembling look at the fear that swept through these men remember Philistines they weren't animals they were men and women like you and I are they had feelings they um then what happened is they started losing their mind fear hit these men they started to panic they started to get scared and they started to turn on each other so they're they're up there they they know that this these 20 people there are 20 of their comrades had been conquered by these two guys and they started to panic and you know what they did pointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou dids laugh look at what this produced in Sarah Look What Fear now Sarah was a very prominent fine lady upstanding she was I mean if you read to the Bible she was a very respected lady Abraham I mean if you read to the Bible she was a very respected lady Abraham obviously was a respected man but look what fear produced in this very special lady she made a mistake and she lied to cover it up because she feared how many times does something threaten us threaten our way or maybe there's a chance that we're going to be embarrassed about something so we get put in this position and all of a sudden we will lie to get our way out of it or lie so we don't get embarrassed you don't have to raise your hand but it happens and that's what fear produces fear comes in and it builds that it makes us lie as we know with the Philistines it makes us fight one another and there is no fear friends there's no fear in God so whenever we have fear we're afraid of what's going to happen we're afraid of maybe changes in the church maybe changes in our lives maybe moving or staying or whatever it might be when you feel that fear that is not God there's concern but put it before him ask him what to do time went on you know we we see that throughout the Bible you can see throughout this Bible God says something very consistent many many times when God is speaking he says fear not don't be afraid until he tells Joshua he tells Moses he tells he tells he tells all of these people don't be afraid fear is not from God and then we fear the lord but that's all that we fear that's the beginning of wisdom because he is the one that can change things you know God he even says it even says in another place it says Don't Fear the ones that can take your life you know we think about I was just I've been watching that um deal with those college students and that murder and all that happened there is an awful thing that that happened in Idaho and I got to I got to thinking and you know as you know the DNA and all the stuff going on and you know they keep feeding you information so you keep going to the website but I thought did these people know the Lord did those three young ladies and that young man did they know God because that's the one that was important it wasn't it wasn't this evil man that took their lives it was the one that kept them away from Christ that's the big fear there you know and we lord the we want to be with you we always want to be close to you we want to know you and Satan is always throwing things that in front of us and making us afraid making us not want to come but I look at these girls and that young man did they know God I pray that they did they they met there in there with a very evil person but the Bible teaches us don't even fear that guy if you're the one that is able to keep us out of Out of Heaven Matthew chapter 21. we we have that these these group of men called the Pharisees and the Sadducees the herodians brother Lyle mentioned the essenes these different these different different groups of Judaism and they were afraid of anything coming against what they believed they were afraid of any type of change because they had their positions they were the ministers they were the preachers they had the respect among the people they had the money they were it and they didn't want to say any see anything come in to change what their quality of life was they were afraid of it Matthew chapter 21. verse 24 says this and Jesus answered and said unto them I also will ask you one thing he's talking to these people they asked him a question he says if you will tell me I and likewise will tell you by what Authority I do these things Jesus says this the baptism of John whence was it from heaven or from Men and they're reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did you not believe him but if we shall say of Men We Fear the people for all whole John as a prophet and listen to this cowardly answer because they were afraid they should have known this Jesus Christ was actually the Messiah that was promised to come but they didn't care what they cared about is their own way they cared about their own religion they cared about their own thoughts they cared about keeping their own positions what they didn't care enough about was their souls and they didn't care enough about The Souls of the people that were in their congregations and they answered Jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell I by what no to tell I you by what Authority I do these things hypocrites is what they were Jesus called them that if they had respect they did have the respect they had the power they had the money and they were going to do anything to keep it because that was what was important to them including threatening and killing not only Jesus but also his disciples they feared they feared the people they feared they're losing their positions fear had consumed these people there's fear all over the place today there's fear in these pulpits there's fear that maybe what I'm preaching or maybe what I've always preached is wrong there's that fear there's fear that that somebody's going to come in and take some of the people from this church and they'll go to that church not caring about the people and I'm not saying just in message churches are I'm not saying that I'm saying all over the place it's fear brother Branham said this Church age Book quote he said have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear they say that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow there are false prophets for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ and he won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says they spread rumors they spread they throw out little lies just to keep their own Doctrine just to keep their own ways and they ignore they ignore what the word says they're they're and it's fear friends it's dominated by fear that's why that's why people do things you know that's that's why they lash out that's why you'll see a lot of times you'll see the different churches fighting with each other it's their fear maybe maybe I'm not right of course you don't say that but there is an inward feeling many times maybe I'm not right and you'll see like that rattlesnake many times they'll lash out and they'll bite but that's not the spirit of Christ but there is a way there is something that will overcome that let me get before we get there let me get to Matthew chapter 26. verse 73. this is Peter Jesus is going to the cross all the disciples were afraid they were terrified of what was going to happen they saw their leader just plucked up being beaten they feared wait a minute were we wrong on this and now they're fearing for their own skin and here's Peter fearing for his own skin it says this Matthew chapter 26 verse 73 and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter surely Thou Art one of them for thy speech be writhe then began he to curse and swear this is Peter saying I know not the man and immediately the crew Peter was afraid and he wanted to separate himself from Jesus and the way that he did that was to change his way of speaking now we go to work go to school go to these different places what is a good way that people won't think I'm weird people won't think I'm religious throw a little swear word in there it'll separate us from God and it'll separate us God because from God because maybe we're afraid we're ashamed we don't want to be associated with that because it brings a lot of reproach so we'll change our way of speaking like Peter did because we're afraid and it causes us to sin you know I see when when our youth and all of us as we go to work and we want to fit in you know we want to be part you know everybody does it's natural and we should be we should be able to talk to people and and they should see us in a in a in a point of strength you know I look at uh sister Naomi they're telling telling the story about some of the work that you do and some of the people that you witnessed to and the ministry that the Lord's given you and talking to these people and I think what if Naomi what if she said you know what I'm going to change the way I look to look more like these people I'm going to change the way I talk to to talk more like this people that's not love for those people what that is is that fear of me being cast out and it's not love for the ones who might need it and now Sister Naomi's been living this this testimony before these people that she works with and she talks to and then when things go bad Naomi who do they call they call that pillar they call that point of strength if you wouldn't have act that way if you would have tried to fit in with them they would not hold you in that regard neither would they hold me in that guard or any of you in that regard because we just fit in we're just like everybody else which I'm not saying whatever but then you take that gift away from that person that might be in need one day you take that gift that they can't contact you and have confidence in this person that has lived this life of Jesus Christ before them and they don't know anybody else and then they contact you to pray for them and they have faith in your prayers you take that you take that away from the people they're the way to overcome fear friends there's one way to do it remember the little dog you know it was love when that dog saw that I loved it was and when I proved it I wasn't going to hurt it then it started trusting me it started It Started Loving Me and it's the same thing as we go out and we are among all the world if we treat people the same way the world treats each other how are we going to help anybody but if we really love the people then we would live this message before them we will live the life of Christ before these people and do our best to bring them together I think brother Bobby that back there and he's he's he's wanting his heart's desires to bring everybody together and Bobby's this rough tough guy if you don't get together I'm going to beat you over the head not really yeah you will but he loves them he loves the people you young people you ever talk with Bobby Wertz you know there's something about him he loves you and that's the way that we need to present ourselves all the time all the time to people so they can have confidence in US that when this man or when this woman and this boy or girl prays I have confidence in their prayer I I think about the scripture in first John for the Lyle I think that you may have preached this last Sunday but I think it'd be good to hear us again hear this again first John chapter 4. let me go back to something Paul said Paul said that God has not given us the spirit of peer of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor the nor of me his prisoner but be thou partakers of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God first John chapter 4 says this verse 11. beloved if God so loved us we ought to love one another don't fear one another love one another if you think somebody is trying to take something from you take a position in the church take a friend that you have or you fear that they're against them the Bible teaches us let them have it give it to them brother Brown preached this message called teaching on Moses how many have heard it all the youth have heard it I'm sure it's something that that Daniel and Madeline used to they listened to it over and over and over it's it's a it's a message that brother Brown preached to young people and brother Branham says this he says if you try to keep it you'll lose it but if you give it away then you'll keep it and it's the same with these when when somebody tries to take something from us or somebody comes against us let them have it and you'll find that you'll come out a lot better in the end I know and and uh at work I've been successful over the years in management because the way that I do things is is I might have an idea or might be working towards something or get a job or get it going we'll get it we'll we'll get it going on the right direction get it successful and then I'll give it to somebody else and then they can take it maybe to a place that I couldn't have taken it before and that's the way that we do with everything don't ever be afraid to give something up because God might have something better for you or more important for you I've seen people fail and then for the young people when as you as you move through life I've seen people fail so much there's this thing called job security don't get ever caught up in that because you know what if you're gonna have job security you know where you'll stay right there in that job and you won't do any better you'll never get better but if you can help somebody else to maybe do that job and if somebody's trying to take it from you let them have it and you'll find that that's the kind of person that the supervisors and the bosses want and that person will move up and that's how I've had some successes in life and that's really and it's not rocket science it's done that get it going give to somebody that can really do a good job verse 12. no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby we know that we dwell in him and he and us because he have given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he and God that's a powerful statement now where do we get off thinking because we believe a certain Doctrine or a certain way that we're better than anybody else let me read it again whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God so be careful how we talk about one another do they believe in Jesus Christ then that scripture pertains to them I don't care if they're Baptist I mean I could quote brother Branham all day on this Baptist Catholic whatever you are Do You Believe In Christ I don't care what brand you have I was witnessing to the lady across the street um on the mechanics shop there yesterday and I asked her I said I said are you Christian she said no I'm a Catholic I said why do Catholics always say that I said Do You Believe In Jesus she said yes I said why are you not a Christian she's because I'm Catholic I didn't get it to this day I don't get it do we believe in Jesus Christ or not I asked her I said Do You Believe In Jesus she said yes so all right I don't care what brand you put on yourself we're Christians together that's the same I don't care if your tapes only are five-fold or whatever you are brother Bobby do you believe in Jesus Christ or not if you do then you are my brother you are my sister he is the one that we lift up and we know and we have known and believe the love of God that the love that God hath to us I like this part right here God is love it is it brother Wilson God is love maybe if you just had three words in this Bible I think you could get it just from that and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the way of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love never fear we love him because he first love us loved us does that sound familiar it's a good song that we sing all the time if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen in this commandment we have from him that he who loveth God love his brother also don't ever fear the bravest man that had ever as has ever been mentioned in the history of the world the bravest person the one the warrior that conquered the most in this book the greatest man that has ever walked this Earth feared nothing why did he fear nothing because he had a greater love than anything this world has ever seen he had a love that he would lay down his life for all of humanity but the Lyle if it would have just been me he had laid his life down why did he not fear anything how could he stand in the face of these Pharisees and Sadducees knowing what his end would be and yet loving them and those same ones that I talked about earlier that were scheming against him and wouldn't answer the questions and wanted to keep their positions and all that and he gets up they nail him to the cross he goes up on this cross he's he's lifted up before the people and what does he say brother Ron what does he say he said father forgive him Lord forgive him they don't know what they do look at the love that Christ had and then we see the love later on we see the Same Love in that man named Stephen he said the same thing he was there he was kneeling down and they had the stones and they were they were hitting them with these stones and he's like he says he's the Lord forgive him I don't know what they're doing there's that same Spirit of Christ no fear and Stephen because he had that love wherever we go whatever we do going to work going to school going to church if there is any type of hatred if there is any jealousy if there is any type of feeling think about where is this feeling coming from could it be maybe because I'm not going to get my way could it be a fear of that could it be maybe the fear that I'm wrong and something could it be the fear of I'm not going to get a position or I'm not going to get a job I'm not going to get a promotion could it be that and then we slip in a little bit of a negative word and I've seen it with the young people a lot of times this boy I like this girl you know they do and and the girl might say something to the boy about boy number two oh yeah he's you know he's not going to be successful he doesn't get good grades or he's not a good Christian or whatever just throw it in there just to turn him off the path because he fears that he might like this girl but he fears that she might like him but if he really loved if he really had that love he'd say he's a good man he's a good brother don't worry you know just like you especially if you're positive yeah yeah maybe uh sisters if you could come to close I I think about how that we have been taught through the word to never extend God and I was there was a time a couple years ago I'll give a little testimony that it was almost three years ago and I knew in my heart I knew that I had to make a move in my life I knew that I had to I had to move on and I was scared I was like 48 years old I might have to find another job I'm gonna have to find I'm gonna have to support my family and I remember [Music] a heartache is but a stepping stone all along the train that winding always upward this troubled world [Music] on until then my heart will go on scene but but until then with joy I'll carry on [Music] until the day my eyes behold the city until the day God calls me home verse two the things I've heard will dim and lose their value if we hear me they're borrowed for a while [Music] and things of Earth that's caused the heart to tremble remember there will more we bring a smile but until then my heart will go on seeing foreign [Music] with joy I'll carry on until the day my eyes [Music] to all his turn to Romans chapter 6. it reads like this know ye not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with them by the baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for we for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that all old man is crucified that old Jonah is crucified that old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we henceforth we should not serve and that is the meaning friends baptism water's cold and as as I baptize our brother that he will go down into the water symbolizing going down into the grave and then I will bring him back up see symbolizing the resurrection of Jesus Christ a new man our dear brother has made this Choice himself he says he's been thinking about and praying about it for a year now now it's time to go into these Waters and be baptized in Jesus no you feel good raise your hand to the people saying I want to be baptized and I accept Jesus Christ as my savior I want to be baptized today instead of Jesus Christ is my savior oh my put your hands together and uh hold my hand foot tight and I'm gonna promise I'll bring you back up according to your own confession baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we thank you for our dear brothers now father may your promises manifest themselves in his life and may he go forth and be a witness disgusting to all the world in Jesus Christ's name congratulations do you know [Applause]
