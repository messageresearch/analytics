good to be in the house of the lord amen are you thankful we still have a privilege to gather publicly as christians oh you say brother daniel i thought we were always going to have that no we may not have that someday you know so most people would think the tribulation was on if that happened but you got to remember that our brothers and sisters before that they met in the catacombs they met just wherever they could it may happen again i say we appreciate the day that we have my grandfather used to get out of open throw his legs out of bed push the curtain open and he'd say this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice and be glad in it amen we're going to do something a little bit different we're going to read together maybe psalms 139 if you have your bibles we call it reciprocal reading back home we do it on sunday morning we pick a psalm and the the speaker will read the first verse and then the audience read the second verse and we read that way through the whole chapter and then maybe read the last verse verse 24 altogether so psalms 139 i don't know if the brothers have it if somebody how'd they say it the sisters with the babies want to be able to hold their babies and still see it on the screen we as warriors like to take our sword and know right where it is in our bible psalms 139 maybe we'll read this together do we have somebody back there that can pull it up on the on the overhead well let's go ahead and do it all right psalms 139 oh lord thou has searched me and knowing me amen that was really good thou compasses my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways thou hast beset me behind and before and has laid thine hand upon me whether shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea i hope you're seeing that david is saying that god knows every place that he is now you got to realize that the devil he can't create so all he does is pervert and duplicate what god has done so with science and technology he's tried to duplicate what god has done and gives you a cell phone so he can know where you go if you go under the earth he knows you there if you're flying in an airplane he knows you're there your phone knows when you lay down and it stops moving for a time they assume you're sleeping so the devil is just trying to duplicate what god had thousands and thousands of years ago god already had it he already knows your down settings he already knows your upright uprisings amen verse number 12 or was it 12 that we read the last one let's start with 11. if i shall say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously raw in the lower lowest parts of the earth amen aren't you thankful that god saw your substance even when you're unperfect amen we're not perfect now but by the blood of jesus christ but even when we weren't perfect god saw us verse number 17 how precious also are their thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them hey man my wife and i read this psalm the other day and it just really struck us verse 17 god says how great are the some of my thoughts towards you if we would ever get read these verses it'll take care of depression and anxiety and all of those things when the word of god says daniel i've been thinking you don't have any idea the sum the amount of the thoughts that i'm thinking about you now if you could put your name in that verse and know god has a great sum of thoughts that he's thinking about every one of you he knows your down settings your uprising everything about you isn't that wonderful amen god knows about you the creator of heavens and the earth and the thing about it he can be so great he can know that about every individual in the world seven billion people he knows all of that about them and he says my thoughts towards you are great if i should count them they are more in number than the sands of the sea next time you go to the beach just look at the sands of the sea and think the bible says those are like the thoughts of god towards me that's how many times he thinks about me praise the lord surely thou will slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore ye bloody men do not i hate them o lord that hate thee and m not i grieved with those that rise up against thee amen so it's not wrong to hate evil the bible says be angry and sin not a lot of people get angry and then they sin but the bible says be angry and send not here david said i hate them with the perfect hatred they are my enemies and then in verse 23 he says oh god search me o god and know my heart try me and know my ways and all together and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting amen [Music] search me [Music] try me [Music] every i praise the lord [Music] in me from sleep [Music] me [Music] me with [Music] with [Music] is we're gonna have a sister lily and sister grace sing us a song special please be seated [Music] god did great things [Music] he was with [Music] do you think god would do this for [Music] spill did they have to pay for i am the lord that killeth thee as long as they obey they did not change with fashion for their clothes did not wax old and the shoes upon their feet did not let in the cold hallelujah faith is the victory that overcomes the world overcomes the world faith is the victory that overcomes the world [Music] is [Music] is [Music] faith is [Music] with this message [Music] hallelujah faith is faith is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith in his word [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's all stand standing on the promises of christ my king through eternal ages let his praise [Music] yes i'm standing standing on the promises [Music] when [Music] standing on the promises of [Music] standing on the promises [Music] standing on the [Music] makes [Music] standing on the [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yes i'm standing [Music] i'm standing on the promises of god i like that first verse i'm standing on the promises of christ my king o through eternal ages let us praise us glory in the highest i'll shout and sing oh i'm standing on the promises of god oh yes i'm

standing on the promises of god amen i like standing on the promises with the one that says i'll never leave you nor forsake you lo i'm with you always do you believe that the other day my wife and i we went to a little park we went hiking up in the up in the little canyon there and brother robert this big storm started coming into clouds and we said we got to get off this hill it's uh we're way up there in the mountain and started raining we were trying to run down directly we looked back and there was a huge rainbow all over the hill big rainbow there we just stood there looking at it took some pictures of it and all of a sudden another one appeared right above it amen god made a covenant he wouldn't destroy the the world by water amen anymore and he's he's not going to destroy the righteous with the wicked he's just a little confirmation i'm with you brother daniel he's never leave us never forsake us aren't you thankful for that it's nice to see it in the word but it's nice when god comes and gives us a visible covenant said oh that's not enough here i'll give you another one amen a double rainbow rainbow is beautiful in fact it's on the top of my ipad you know hey here it is right there see if i can do this screen here you can see it there's the one picture of it nice that's just one side it was huge through the whole thing i keep it in front of me amen the bible says write them upon the tablets write them upon your your door post to your house when you look at it like oh yeah i remember that yeah i remember that experience that i remember that experience praise the lord god bless you musicians i appreciate the song that peterson sang wasn't that a beautiful song and what they didn't give the history of that their grandmother brother al's mother wrote that so there was a little tribute to her maybe she's got old hour to look over the balcony today and allow her to see her grandchildren standing up here singing about the the grace and the uh of god faith is our victory that overcomes the world amen i just today's mother's day god bless all the mothers with your mother would you raise your hand amen god bless you let's give them a hand clap today special day praise the lord amen none of us would be here without a mother amen may god bless them we're going to speak a little bit about that coming up and i got to tell you your testimony is reaching far in this city i was uh i was up we were had to get an airbnb we're staying a few miles about 15 miles up or oracle road there and i had to get a haircut i was looking a little shaggy and so i went in um the other day my brother john flew in actually wednesday night late and so thursday and friday we spent some time together and we need a haircut so we go in this place and i don't know how you all do it here and there was somebody there to cut my hair we just got to talking a little bit i said well we're what are you doing here i said well i'm in town helping down at tucson tavern like a tucson tabernacle we started talking they said where is that i said it's on north street you know you won't know where this place is like well you know we start talking a little bit like where where exactly is it on north street and he's talking a little bit and then directly a person said well you know i live in the apartments right down at the end of the street and i've been up to your food bank and i've got food up there and and they're just three blocks away from here so i try to invite them out to church come on out to church we not only have natural food we have spiritual food amen we got an angel that came in our day and said store this up daniel and the believers are going to need it in this generation so there's a people that are feeding on that word so amen just keep being a testimony for the lord you may not think that people aren't watching but they're watching they're watching everybody's watching amen may god help us to just do that which is right we were talking about a couple things just give me a couple minutes we've got to get through these announcements we were talking about having fellowship and things and there's a lot that we could do but we were just thinking maybe this friday night we would maybe be together and have like a meal together and maybe do like a pitch-in luncheon here maybe friday night if that's okay i know everybody's day timer's running through their mind friday and they want to pull their phone out check the calendar but just maybe keep in mind as we say back home no time is a good time so this you just set a time and say this is when we're going to do it but we'd love each everybody to come out maybe friday night and i don't know my wife or some of the ladies could get together and just coordinate so we don't have all baked beans there but maybe we can get kind of a variety and come together i think it would be good that we have fellowship amen fellowship is good encouragement you get together and realize you know i'm not the only one fighting this battle there's other people that's got teenagers you know and you look around like you know i got a pain in my knee like hey i got one in my back and you fellowship in your suffering sometimes amen but we all going through trials and battles it's good to come to church amen and see other christians so maybe we'll do that friday night about 6 30. if you can't make it at 6 30 come at 7 30. if you can't come at 7 30 come at 8 o'clock amen to encourage you just to be together with believers tonight we're going to have communion we had talked about having it last week and we baptized anthony and so it would work better to do it this weekend so tonight we're going to have the communion service also something special on mother's day i met with brother figueroa the other day and the lord's doing something special in his life and i asked him if he would maybe come and speak for us tonight brother robert figueroa i think he spoke here a couple weeks ago at the memorial service um so we just want to i invited him if he'd come back seemed like the holy spirit impressed that on me to just have him come back tonight so he's going to come back and and speak for us before the communion i appreciate him and his labors i think he labored here i don't know what it was 28 years or something he was here before he started helping the group in sara vista so just come expect and i know i'm excited to see an older man like that still has the fire and zeal for the lord i said you remember you may not have ever listened to the the testimony of jack cole but jack cole came and he sought the lord and he found the lord and he tells the story going through the grocery store and screaming hot dog i got it hot dog i got it and got salvation and i wish people would just get what jack cole got sometimes and he walked through there and he seen a tomato can it had red tomatoes he said that reminds me of the blood of jesus christ and he went running through the store and run you know we say we're message and we're way up here we just need to get what jack cole has a lot of time he's running through the thing and he comes to the end and there's a butcher standing there in his clothes and he said you know what he said i know you you've been up to that revival up there jack cole got something so great inside me went home and his mother was an unbeliever just a total center one day she came to the service said if it'll do that for jack cole i want it too said at the end of the service she came up to the altar and she said god i don't know anything about you but give me what jack's got god give me what jack's got god give me what jack's got i pray each one of us gets so full of the holy ghost people come they don't know anything about god but say lord give me what this brother's got lord give me what this sister's got give me with this i thought about brother anthony just got baptized he doesn't know anything about the bible doesn't know anything about god doesn't know he's just new to all of this and so there the bible says you are written epistles read and knowing of all men so he may never understand that he's trying to learn i said look this is the old testament this is the new testament 66 books 39 in the old 27 and he's just it's all new like a baby he's learning the whole thing but us have walked with god for so long he's not going to you know what he's going to look at your life more than he does this bible he's because you are the written bible and so he's going to look at your zeal and love for god more than he's like well they don't even care about then why do i why would i but i say lord fill me with the holy ghost amen lord they're going to read my life let me be a written epistle knowing and read of all men a song so touch me about the i don't know was it ray boltz that wrote that about the cross amen they gave their life on crosses and died you heard the story of them frozen i think don francisco talked about them being frozen out on the islands 49 soldiers for jesus is a good song if you've never heard it i mean these people gave their life i want to have what those people had in my life amen blessed be the name of the lord i haven't read the text yet y'all are just pulling me everywhere amen if you have your bibles let's go to ecclesiastes chapter 3. amen i'm just so excited about being a christian having the zeal of the lord and you know what it is it's because i'm getting older amen i can see the end and i realize i only have a few more days a few more years to do something for the lord and i want to go out with a bang you know they do those fireworks and they just send a few things up but at the end they have this grand finale and that's the way i want my life to be i want to go as one man said i want to go and i want to fall into the grave completely spent for jesus christ i want my body to be wore out i want my memory i want all of it to be wore out because i want to be how's paul say i'm willing to be spent spend and be spent for your sake amen praise the lord ecclesiastes chapter 3. let's just ask the lord to bless the reading of the word amen lord we just bow our heads to you we thank you for the inspiration of the holy spirit lord i would remember reading in the book of acts he said you have the unction lord and that's what we all need the unction of the holy spirit father in our lives lord as i remember your prophet saying in the message the token he said the theme of every apostle was to ask people have you received the holy ghost since you believed have you received the quickening power of jesus christ since you believed the word of god and the message of the hour and i pray god you'd fill us all with the holy spirit lord the bible says as peter spake the word the holy ghost fell upon them and lord i pray as we read the word of god and speak of you may the holy ghost fall among us lord may we hear the wonderful works of god how god is working among us and changing lives and moving us closer to you lord we thank you for what you've done looking forward to what you continue to do and i pray lord you'd work in me lord do a work a mighty work in my life i pray lord help me to throw away the things of the world and the desires of the world that are not like you and love you with all of my heart soul mind and body help us today lord and i pray as a body of believers lord we just lift up joseph lord roberts there who's there he just got his cast and is in pain this morning i pray in the name of jesus that you would go to him lord send your angels to him as a group of body of believers lord we lift our faith to our brothers in this wheelchair as a young man lord is 15 years old and he's sitting there suffering i pray you would touch his body and heal him today and amen lord bless him and help him and strengthen him and his father if he's there with him lord bless them together bless sister sarah lord who's given so much in their family going through this trial your word says when one suffers we all suffer together lord you said bear ye one another bird and lord and i pray that you would bless this family and help them and encourage them today i pray in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord ecclesiastes chapter three i want to read this chapter some of the verses here ecclesiastes chapter 3. the bible says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill a time to heal time to break down a time to build up there's a time to weep there's a time to laugh some people they just don't i just weep in time i'm just you know how's it saying lady it says they're poor wretched mind blind and miserable and you see some people they just get enough of god to be miserable and hateful and armory and do we have to do that and be a christian they're miserable but here the bible says there's a time to laugh and i think it says in another place the joy of the lord is our strength the david said lord restore unto me the joy of our salvation god bless you brother up in the balcony i don't know who you are but everybody look up there he's bouncing up and down something's happening in that brother's life and i guess it's only the second time he's been to church god bless you brother david said the joy of the lord is our strength and he got to a place the trials were so great he said lord restore to me the joy of my salvation some of us has lost the joy of our salvation and we're just going through the grind i tell you there's a place where the oil of the holy ghost can fill our lives amen and we say lord this is i enjoy this i enjoy church i enjoy god i enjoy the forgiveness of sins forgiven i enjoy the liberty the bible says where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty so if brother arnie takes off and starts running around this church you'll know wow he's got something give me what brother arnie's got he's back there smiling time to laugh a time to mourn time to dance time to cast away stones the time to gather stones together a time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing i like to preach a young people service right there there's a time to refrain from embracing and that's before you're married embracing other individuals of the opposite sex a time to get time to lose a time to keep a time to cast away a time to rend time to sow a time to keep silent there comes a time as a father you've got to speak you've got to say something time is a mother day's mother's time there's psalms mama says nope that's wrong we're not going to do that so the bible says there's a time a time to love a time to hate a time of war time of peace what shall it prof what prophet hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth i have seen the labor which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end go down to verse 14. i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him amen may god bless his reading of the word you may be seated praise the lord sometimes preachers just have to vent they kind of build this up kind of inside of them and i don't know if you ever had a thermostat stick on your radiator of your car you know but it and then it gets all that pressure and sometimes you just gotta vent it out and so you gotta vent it out in the right way i think i told you all about the big scar i have on my my arm right here i got a big scar people don't show their scars but i got a big scar on my wrist i was 17 18 19. i was up in vancouver visiting some friends and their car overheating you know i'm the hero and all the ladies and the guys around like hey and when i took it off and it sprayed up on my arm and in my face and so there was some malpractice they treated it wrong now i've got a big scar and it tells me don't vent in the wrong way some people they get under pressure in life pressure comes to everybody you know sometimes young people they get under pressure and they go drink and they do drugs or they may be living morally that's not the way to vent we have a way to let off pressure brother and preached the whole message he saw this days he preached a message called letting off the pressure letting off the pressure people it builds up and it builds up and it builds up i remember i was a 15 year old boy i was sitting in down in the basement in my brother's basement i was talking to my best friend jesse collins he was a diesel mechanic i knew he went to school and i said jesse what happens if this engine builds up if you know anything about compression engines and you know there's the piston comes up and the spark and the gas and diesel is just there's no spark plug it just comes up and the compression the heat and and then it explodes and pushes a piston down and so i was talking i said what happens if there and he went through this great scientific reason of what would happen i said and i was like you don't understand i am as a teenager i'm 15 years old and i'm under so much pressure and god began to deal with i mean it wasn't just a couple months later than a youth uh camp that i was sitting about where our brother here nathan is and they made a call and i got up and went down and i let off the pressure in jesus christ and gave it all to him say lord here's my life i've made a mess of my life and my testimony and when my teacher looked at me we went to a christian school you probably heard my testimony she said daniel you have the filthiest mouth in this christian school i thought oh god what a terrible testimony i have my father's a minister i've just made a mess of my life but you know i went to the altar and i laid it all down that's what altars are for they're places where living things die and i you know god just got to the place he said i'm sick and tired of lambs and goats and all this blood he said i don't want that i want a living sacrifice and i went down sister hannah and i laid my life down and said lord here's all of my life and i gave it to christ and he came in and i got up and i walked away a different person amen i went from the back row of just wanting to be a teenager and aloof i went up in a front lord i just want to be in your presence lord i want to be lord close to the flame of fire and i can hear my mom's voice speaking to me tonight i called her last night to wish her happy mother's day i haven't got to my first note on my page here but it's mother's day so i sit and talk to my mom and you know it's a mother it's amazing how a mother can shape your life she's probably watching today god bless you mom she doesn't they haven't been able to go to church in a long in over a year i guess their church and so she's streaming and so he said mom you can stream us today it's amazing there was a little book my mother had she said children are are wet cement and you mold them and shape them for a period of time and then that's all you have them and they're set for life the bible says train up a child in the way it should go and when he's old he'll not depart from it amen he might stray away from it a little bit but you've molded something in him so that's why you realize it's wet cement if any of you brothers any brothers ever poured concrete how many brothers we have yes we got some concrete so you pour that concrete and all of a sudden you get in a hurry like we got to get this done and we you get it all done and when you get done your little kid comes up puts his hand up here like puts his hand printed and oh we didn't wipe that out and there it is forever their hand print and those things make an impression in your life they they mold you and she had this little book so children are wet cement and it made an impression on me that young people they're there for a little time and you have an impression and then they grow older as the one man said arrows were never meant to stay in your quiver they're made to point in the right direction and shoot them and that's the way children are they uh oh this little girl shot love her we never had girls but i can imagine i'm going to keep this girl at home and then you know they get older and you know they're like you know and then maybe boys you're like you know i've got to point you and then i want you to go paul told timothy follow me as i follow christ it was imitation you follow me that's what parenting sometimes people they get to place they're telling their kids what to do is like instead of doing that say hey you just do what i do you just do what i do you respect the policeman and you do what's right you be responsible when sunday comes we go to church because they're gonna they're gonna do what you do you're where every one of us are preaching a gospel i remember one time is this okay this is just me this is kind of so i remember going in my basement i was like 17 18 years old and i preached i felt like there was a call in my life and i went down in our basement and i walked i remember walking in and my mom followed me in and i said mom i'm never going to preach again she said why daniel why why do you say that and i remember looking at her and i said you know what i've got some deep convictions in my heart about the bible and the word of god and and i just people don't want to hear that i don't i'm not going to do it and she looked at me and she shaped my life she said daniel that's what this world needs is men that have strong conviction and she made an impression on my life she molded me she shaped me and sometimes they shape you and maybe it's not for everybody but maybe it's just for me last night i was talking to her on the phone she had six children so she spent time in the nursery she said i spent that time in the nursery she said when i come out of that nursery she said i purposed in my heart that if i couldn't see the weight in the preacher's eyes she said i was sitting too far back so she said i had to see the white in the preacher's eyes and that was just her but it made an impression on me last night so you know now as a young person like i got to see the white in that preacher's eyes obviously brother branham's day there was 8 000 people in the congregation but she had a conviction in her heart she wanted to be close to where the minister was and that's the thing parents you're molding and shaping people's lives amen mothers and fathers alike we don't have father's day but god help us all going back to our subject here i just want to get started here and i want to read a quote brother and said you know we got to have a doctrine brother ham taught us he said you don't have a church without a doctrine every church has a doctrine and so we believe according to the scripture that god sent a message in this day malachi 4 says i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord so we believe god was going before he burnt the earth he was going to send elijah the prophet now he had two choices one i'll either strike the earth with a curse and destroy it like he did in noah's day or i'll send elijah the prophet jesus was concerned he said when the son of man cometh will he find faith so i believe it's what is it matthew 17 or matthew 11. the disciple says i thought elias was to come and jesus refers to william branham's ministry and says truly elias shall truly come and restore all things now he wasn't referring to john the baptist because if he had referred to john john the baptist and john the baptist was to restore he would have restored them back to the law of moses so jesus was they were talking to him about thinking it was john the baptist and jesus is saying future truly elias shall future he'll come and he'll restore all things jesus saw the church ages he saw it all fall he saw the dark ages he said i'm going to send you william branham's ministry and it's going to restore you back to the faith of our father so i say if jesus saw the ministry and acknowledgement how much more i should be able to see the ministry and acknowledge it and see what it does for my life and so i want to read this right here brother adam says and here we are down in the ladies in church age i love a prophet because he tells you where you are people they get in the world and they get lost like i don't know where we are it's the end of the world is this the beginning are the chinese it looks like the chinese are going to rule the world and it looks like they're building then they got armies and what they say you can name just doing the mass some of you are scientists you probably they said you can you can stand them for a breast and just march them into the ocean and the there's so many of them i don't know if it's 1.3 billion or 4 billion now that march them in the ocean they'll reproduce and you'll never run out of chinese and so it looks and if you watch the world or and watch how they're gaining dominance and things and like like that and so we had a prophet come in our day and he begins to talk about the roman catholic church is going to rule the world it's not going to be the chinese that rule the world we the roman catholic church is going to rule the world so you watch these players and we've lived long enough to see all these things coming to pass and see america go into debt and so a prophet comes and shows us the seven church ages in revelations chapter two and revelations chapter three these are things to help guide you through life we especially as men need to know because our children are going to come to us and no we're not going to it's not going to be a thousands and thousands of more years no right before the lord burns the earth with a and the earth is destroyed by fire we remember reading it over in peter hill the elements will melt like fervent heat so when you have a revelation of the scripture you don't put your whole life into becoming a millionaire and forsake god you remember amen that the bible says that the earth is going to burn with the fervent heat then we had a prophet come in our day had seven visions and every one of them come to pass we see them coming to pass we don't have time this morning to go through but the last one was america just in craters if you have a revelation of that it'll keep you from getting distracted and say oh how's the bible say six days shalt thou labor and the seventh day shalt thou rest it's the lord's day instead of working seven days if you go back in the book of um and study the romans and the jews the things that made romans romans and the jews were separated the jews would take a day and set it aside to rest where the romans they just work seven days a week so you see that culture coming today where the stores are now open seven days a week and there's no regard for god they just go on it's that roman spirit coming back in this day so now we have a prophet come goes to the book of revelations chapter 2 and chapter three and shows us that we're living in the last part of chapter three and the first verse of chapter four is come up higher which is the rapture so we're living right at the closing of the ladies and churches you said well how do you know it's the ladies in church age where we're living because the bible says thou art rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing have you ever seen in the history of the world where people are so rich and have need of nothing some of us think i need that other pair of shoes well what about those 15 that are in the closet that are right there you know when we were young you had play shoes and church shoes you had you had work play clothes and you had church clothes and that was you know and we were so blessed hey siri turn the temperature up hey siri uh turn the light out and we're so rich and increased with goods and haven't you and god said look you're wretched poor mind blind and miserable and you don't even know it brother and preach the message called and knoweth it not listen to the message if you're a young person listen to the message and knoweth it not brother ram talks about your body soul and spirit your triune being all these revelations of the prophet will help you identify where you are in the world history he'll go through and dissect you when you're tempted that's another sermon as well brother adam said this we're down at the ladies in church age and we're taught the lady in church aids that christ was put on the outside of his church and it was even knocking on the door trying to get back in and we see that happening and we we are we know the age that we're living in and now we're at the closing history of the world the world the book is now being finished the last line will be wrote across it someday and she'll be closed and time will be no more that's why we come to church to shake our minds away from the world shake our minds away from that young man that came to me that one day i think i did this illustration here a few weeks ago and that young man said i'm just going to walk away from god and i'm not going to serve the lord and when i get ready i'll come back and he was thinking that his desire for god was like this light switch i'm going to turn it off and when i get ready for god i'll turn it back on and we come to church to shake our minds and realize that jesus said no man comes to the father but by me it's not like hey i'm 16. i'm going to go do my thing when i get ready and i make a million dollars i'll be back when i'm 40 or 50. and the bible says we shake ourselves as young people shake yourselves from that jesus said i come in an hour that you think not when you don't think and you think authority and i'm going to come when at this age and so we shake ourselves from that and we shake away from the glitter and the glamour of the world because all of us are tempted every one of us have temptations you think well you're a 15 year old boy you're 18. i got these temptations mom and dad don't have any idea no mom and dad are tempted just like you it just changes every seven years you go through a change in your mind and your body and you say i don't believe that well you don't have to believe it but if you'll just practice it it'll help you when you get to those stained changes of your life and you realize that you go through a change but after when you're seven you're tempted to steal that cookie or steal something and you change in your 14 and then the boys and the girls and then you get 18 and then you get 21 and then you've got those kids you're like hey i'm just and i see sometimes parenting people have maybe a few children then they get their last one and they get tired and they kind of just check out they just like hey i'm down with this parenting and they kind of check out no no god gave them to us for a reason their responsibility i'd like to so many things you know i i i'm a minister that's not ashamed of where the the the things that have molded my life that i'm not ashamed to tell where i got them i see some ministers are ashamed they'll preach the message but they will not say i got this from william branham they're ashamed of many denominational people they'll preach the revelation of the message but they won't say hey i'm reading the messages of william branham and coming and preaching i'm not ashamed to say that i'm following a message that god sent by william branham and if you go back and read the message a man running from the presence of the lord and brother ram says now when you have children or we it's responsibility when you have those little children you get little fingerprints on the walls and you know you say i don't want those well that's the responsibility then you have a responsibility to raise them and to correct them and and educate them and so it's a responsibility and when you get married it's a responsibility some young men they get married and then they they want to go out and do all their hobbies and like well hey that you should have done that for you made a commitment to love honor and cherish and care about the way your wife feels or she's lonelier and then you and same with the wife you've got all these things and you make an obligation i promise to cherish and and value this it's getting really quiet in here but this is what pastors do all right evangelists run and scream and do all that but pastors just simple and talk and here i've got all these notes and the holy spirit's saying look you're not going to preach that so god help us today brother rahm says there's a great gran drama being set the angels are standing over the skies and they're watching as the actors are ready you can see them acting and on the uh they're acting you can see the evil one acting you can see the villain at the play and how he's coming to the scene and his cunningness to to deceive and here's a prophet showing us all these players that are in place and he said you can see the raptured church making herself ready and it's a great scene oh i trust that he saw me i trust him when he saw looked down in this thing and he saw all the preachers just quitting because some went to doctrine come and said look just stop preaching and and i trust he saw me reading the scripture jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel i trust he saw me standing here preaching today and preaching the gospel and being faithful he said all the raptured church is getting ready it's a great scene he said you can see the presence of god vindicating and making the great drama that's uh foretold here in the bible to act out what a what a time to live the most glorious time the men of all ages is long for this time the prophets of old long to see this hour but they wasn't privileged but we are privileged to live in this day we are privileged the darkest time there's never been a time where it's been more dark than this time isaiah said there'll be darkness on the earth and gross darkness on the people it'll be actually gross you don't believe it go down to walmart walk through walmart and just look at the people like this is just gross the bible prophesied said it'd be a gross time and in that time god chose you he chose me i'd love to live back there in that day and just you know get in the herd with the two million people leaving egypt like hey here we go cross and go right in there you know but no god chose you every day brother edward you have to fight a battle greatest battle ever fought greatest battle ever fought how we read at second corinthians chapter 10 casting down imagination when the devil's putting thoughts in your mind as we said now don't think of a pink elephant no you already thought about pink california because you can't control your thoughts the devil can put thoughts in your mind and that's you're sitting there trying to love the lord serve the lord ding a little text and then like go go go check your text go check your text and it's actually dopamine they say dopamine when you hear that ding and i can't preach that sermon the bible says that we are not ignorant of the devil's devices you go back and study facebook and they got people in the room and said how can we addict those people to their phones and they said we're gonna we're gonna pattern this just after the slot machines when you go to the gambling and they become addicted when they pull those slots down and ding i want something and they do the same thing with the facebook and it goes ding and they said it releases dopamine in your brain dopamine is more addictive than cocaine and now he's addicted all these people and people they love god a lot i want to say ding why can't you lay it down there's an addiction that comes with that and once you learn that like hey i'm gonna put that on silent i'm gonna talk to the creator lord help me i'm not ignorant of those devices i'm not gonna let that thing rule me i'm gonna put it in its place i'm not gonna let it rule over me and me become a master how do we read that the other day in corinthians he said yield your members as members of righteousness and not unto unrighteousness why would i let this little device come in and i become addicted to it and take me places that are bad and evil and i hear things that i wish i hadn't heard and i see things i wish i hadn't seen because of this device now i know preachers and then they say look you can't have facebook or you can't have a cell phone i don't think the bible says use the world but don't abuse it put it in its place lord help us today so much i would like to say but we're living in an age where the son of man ministry is coming our day luke 17 30 i was thinking of that scripture the bible says as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be luke 17 26 he says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the day of son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted building and build it and but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so what was going on in the days of sodom it was homosexuality you think homosexuality is going away not on your life it's prophesied remember they were going to legalize in one state and people like oh no texas has done it oh no i like hey get used to it's going to cover because it's prophesied all of sodom and gomorrah as it was in that day it's going to be in this day it's prophesied it's not going away so shall it be in the coming son of man when the son of man is revealed but what happened up on the hill in the days of lot abraham was sitting there remember the angel come elohim come and said you're going to bear a son and sarah laughed in the tent and the elohim said why did sarah laugh they called her out sarah why'd you laugh she said i didn't laugh he said oh but you did laugh you laughed in her heart wasn't an audible she laughed in her heart as it was in sodom so shall it be in this day remember jesus comes to the woman at the well and he's sitting on the well in the city of samaria said go get your husband she said i don't have a husband. he said you've said right you've had five the one you're living with now your sixth one is not yours but she said wait i know when the messiah comes he'll do what you just did messiah means the anointed one she said i know when the anointed one comes he'll do it he said i'm the one that's talking to you and so brother bam goes back and the angel comes to brother branham and says you're going to have a gift of discernment you'll know the thoughts and the intents of the heart then he takes them back to revelation or luke 17 30. as it was in that day it's going to be in this day and now we have 1200 tapes that you can listen to of the discernment of the son of man being revealed in our day and they'd stand up and they bring them around this side i keep doing this like this because brother ram said the angel of the lord is always on my right side he said that's why i bring the prayer line this way he said because the angel stands between me and those people and you can listen to it on the tape he said now you feel that presence that won't hurt you that's him that's standing between he said now that's a sweet humble tender presence and so we see we have 11 1200 tapes of that so he preaches a message recognizing your day and its message can we get through this doctrine will you bear with me a couple more minutes here brother man preaches a message anointed ones at the end time some of you maybe were raised in pentecost and they say look there's the holy spirit following that person she's speaking in tongues and running the aisles and i know that's the holy spirit maybe she's cut her hair and she's dressed in morally i know that's the prophet god said i know that stumbles you god showed him anointed ones at the end of time he preaches the whole message the rain falls on the just and the unjust on the wheat and the tares it falls in but what is the true evidence of the holy spirit is the life that you live by their life by their fruits you still know them so at the end of the message he comes down and this is really good this will help you because some people looked at the ministry of brother branham just like they did john the baptist remember they came to john said are you christ or do we look for another are you the one jesus said or john said no i'm just the voice of one crying in the wilderness i must decrease he must increase so when brother branham came in our day and had such a amazing ministry of the son of man that god gave to william it wasn't william brandon i want you to always remember this go back and watch deep calls the deep he's standing there he said i'm as helply as helpless as a baby unless he comes i i can't discern these people it was not william branham it was jesus christ borrowing a body and it was christ's ministry through him it's the same as the people getting up here singing a song or or or witnessing all of you all witnesses ain't you it's christ anointing your memory and then you do something for the lord and it wasn't william brandon it was jesus christ coming brother adam says this and he said i want you to know this for sure you that listen to this tape that you might know today that i was trying to say i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice some people try to make him god and here's william i'm saying look i'm just the voice i'm the microphone that this is flowing through and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but he said it was the will of my father that i declare to do and i'm determined to do it i wasn't the one now listen how he he he changes right here he said i wasn't the one that appeared on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only the one that's near when he does it isn't that what john was saying i must decrease it's him it's jesus christ and any ministry that doesn't point you to christ has got another uh objective and we want all of the ministry everything we do not to glorify man but to glorify jesus christ he said it wasn't what i knew he said it's what i just surrender myself to that he spoke through it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god it's the angel he said the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and then he makes this amazing statement he said if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above the denominations and the things of the world will you do it amen so he's bringing the people down to a challenge and i can tell you if you'll feed on the word of god's message in this day the son of man the things of the world will fade away from you the denominational idea even that comes into the message that will fade away from you and you realize that jesus christ loves you so much that he sent a message in this day all right done with the doctrine back to our text series ecclesiastes chapter 1. the bible says to everything there is a season i began to meditate on that yesterday brother lyle and i begin to think about the bible says to everything there is a season there is a season for this plex plexiglas there is a season for this speaker here there is a season for this microphone if you went back 20 years brother branham didn't necessarily have lapel mics there was a season and then technology changes and you discard it and so we find that everything has a seasons back home we have four seasons fall and winter and spring and summer and they go from one to the other we have a house it's just for a season you have children and they're just for a season how many of us would love to freeze our kids at 12 years old and they never went into those teenage years but you can't it's a season and then they move into that and chemicals kick into their mind and they become a different person and men young boys want to become men and start sparring and young ladies are concerned about their appearance and and things and it's a season that they go through it's not going to be forever they won't be teenagers forever you'll go through that and you'll come out the other side i had three boys and we made it through thank the lord you're changing diapers and you're in the nursery like oh i'm in the nursery it's just a season i see our sister in the back smiling it's a season you have to go through that season together you know you go through it i remember my wife when she got pregnant with one of our boys and the first one was really difficult she had a c-section and so the second one and then she got pregnant she came to me and said i'm not going to have this baby and i'd got a little wisdom after being married and i realized i would just agree with her you're right you don't have to have this baby you're right you don't have to have knowing that to everything there's a season within 10 months you're going to have this baby you're going to have this baby it's a season but you have to go through it most of our trials are when we have to change those seasons and we don't want to change seasons i'm going to say that again most of our trials is when we change seasons and we're not ready to change seasons so we're all young and it's as one man say it's a shame that youth is wasted on youth and you see people running and kids like man if i had that much energy i could do great things in the world but it's just youth and they're like stop playing stop playing no it's just something about a child they got to burn off that energy it's a stage and then they'll come up to the or they don't like i don't feel like doing that so y'all just smiling at me you know what i'm talking about and you have a season you know we read there further down there's a time to be born and there's a time to die it's appointed under man and we don't like to think about but as christians you know and and christianity is not all what are the some of the prosperity gospels you know i'm too blessed to be depressed i'm too anointed to be disappointed and sow a thousand dollar seed and god will bless you with a hundred thousand it's a gospel of prosperity and it's not real it's a gospel without a cross the gospel we preach has a cross a crucifixion a death to self and so so many people they sell christianity has no problems but life is real and the gospel came to bring us through life no matter what stage if we're 12 jesus was about his father's business as you go and become a young man and you worry about your career and amen you how they say with men they say i think it's um i think it's three minutes when you meet a man the average time is three minutes you you get through the weather and all that and you say hey what do you do for a living and a man's identity is created by what he does and and the bible tells us that a man should work and god told adam look go have dominion that's why if you're not a christian you don't know christ don't have a relationship with christ many times when you look at the world you and you don't have dominion the devil comes and he pushes you down you watch young people they come up in their senior year the pressure like a sliding board they come down and right at the end and they go out like where am i going to land and the devil comes in at times and there's alcohol and pressures and come on young men don't let the world the devil pull you out there somewhere come in the presence of the lord say lord help me the bible says commit your way unto the lord and he will direct your path the footsteps of the righteous they're ordered by god god has everything in his control he's leading us and guiding us every day things don't just happen by chance god's got it all in control oh if we would just get alone with god and pray and say lord i don't understand this i don't have it it's in my bible in their song he's got it all in control every road i walk down i know he's got a plan lord you're shaping me you're molding back at our church back home we have well you all have them here everyone those are probably man-made fabricated rocks and a mold but if you go out to regular rocks every rock is different and there's been conditions that happened in a per in a life to make that rock different and each one of us are different and god is shaping sister liliana differently than he's shaping sister heather and i think i'm a mother every time i see sister heather just that gentle nature and my daughter-in-law is named heather just a gentle nature each one of you have a character and no one can take your place god's made you different he's made us go through maybe some of you have been coveted through covet and maybe some of you haven't and so your life is different and you're going through just be a christian wherever you are just be a christian be a light say lord this is shaping me maybe you were born in your genetics your genes are weak and and you have a little illness you know or that don't don't discard your life or build a complex or go say look i can no in your weakness say remember paul he had his eyes he said i sought the lord three times that he would deliver and god said my strength is sufficient for you paul it'll keep you humble but look at how he changed the world by writing his letters and preaching the gospel may god help us everyone to say holy spirit empower me with our unique talents and abilities lord let me use my talents for the glory of god was it finney or one of them they'd listen to him say they did or went back and did a review said man the guy squeaks he's ball-headed he's ah look he's just nothing and he said but hey i'm winning souls for christ i'm winning souls for christ i say we do something for the lord jesus so i thought about this seasons changed from a boy to a man from a girl to a woman sometimes our health changes and we go through middle age i was thinking of this scripture back in the book of daniel in daniel chapter 2 verse 20. this is when daniel they were going to kill all the astrologers and daniel i'd like to preach a whole sermon right there when they come and say look we're going to kill you all the first thing daniel did he tried to buy time he said can you give us overnight and he tried to buy the second thing he got with the believers and the saints and he went to a prayer meeting we may need to know that someday always try to buy time when somebody forces you was talking to somebody yesterday and this has happened and this happened and this happened and this happened i said look just look let's just don't make decisions under pressure this is another pastoral thing never make a decision outside of the presence of the lord make all major decisions in the presence of the lord when we come down to the end of the service don't waste the time get down on your knees and pray say lord i have got to make a decision lord will you help me and only make major decisions in the presence of the lord how many young people if they would hear my voice and they say brother daniel said only make major decisions in the presence of the lord and it will save them from making a decision in the backseat of a car somewhere and they make decisions in the presence of the lord lord this is a righteous young man i think i'll take him to be my lord this is a godly sister i see the holy spirit in her life i'm going to make a decision in the presence of the lord so we come down here daniel chapter 2 and verse 20 and daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god forever and ever for wisdom and might are his oh the wisdom is in god what is it james the first chapter it says if any man lack wisdom let him ask of god i don't understand the world and the complexity well they used to say knowledge duplicates every five years uh with technologies and that's why the bible says in the last days knowledge shall increase it's fulfilling the scripture so everything you knew about machine work every five years it doubles and then it doubles now i think they say every year every that's why they have continuing education it doesn't matter if you're in nursing or what you're in the technology comes out and you have to go have continuing education because knowledge shall increase that will help every one of you and say look to keep your nursing license you got to go every two years and have these classes or this because knowledge see it as a scripture then the bible says knowledge shall increase the bible says if any man lack wisdom let him ask god don't get overwhelmed and just go down in depression say lord you help me lord i need wisdom god help me now i want you to notice that wisdom is different than knowledge okay wisdom is different than knowledge knowledge is information wisdom is to know how to apply that information so they tell me and i don't know everything about the fruits and vegetables but they tell me that that tomatoes are a fruit what is it whether you have seeds or something like that so if it's seeds it's a fruit so anyway knowledge tells me that tomatoes are fruit but wisdom tells me don't add a tomato to a fruit salad so i have the knowledge nope it's got seeds going in with the fruits but that wisdom tells me no no don't put that acidic tomato in with that fruit salad you'll ruin it so you see the world is full of knowledge but very little wisdom i'll say this the bible says the fear of the lord is the very beginning of wisdom what would it profit a man if he gained the whole world and he lost his soul it's not getting a lot of knowledge in making a career as a man but the beginning the wisdom of god amen the bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord this is the verse i wanted to get to verse 21 and he god changes the times and the seasons oh sometimes when we go through trials as brother daniel said many times our trials are when god is just changing the seasons of life and we're going through changes and and the bible says that is god that changes the times and seasons he removes the kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge unto them that no understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him daniel goes on to pray and says i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of our fathers who has given me wisdom and might and has made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou hast made known unto us the king's matter so the bible says god is the one that changes you might be going through a change maybe you're well one day and now you're sick and you're going through a different season we need to pray for joseph their whole family is going through a little season and telling how it changes where their beds are and trying to get him out and he can't walk he's in a wheelchair and he's going through a season but that's not the end it's just the season you're in darkness and it's night time you say oh it's nighttime but that it's just a season the sun will come up you just got to get through that that that dark season we've all been through those dark times in our life as long as you hold to christ don't let it bury you don't go out and and just stay with christ remember paul said they were going to abandon the ship and paul said stay with the shep stay with jesus christ amen may god help us because romans 8 28 says all things work together for good now the word of god is an anchor to the believer and your mind will start wandering you come go through seasons of your marriage you see people are engaged like oh we want to do a fairy tale it's like man it's coming life's coming at you it's real praise the lord it's good we got friends having get married in a couple weeks hey and you all laughing like hey it's coming yeah we went we had our honeymoon we came home i remember monday morning i had to you know we went on nice honeymoon and come back monday i had to go to work is this okay this is you become real vulnerable when you share personal things so now you're getting personal stuff so my wife she's like wonderful wife goes downstairs i hear making this orange juice and and all of a sudden i hear and then i hear her crying and so i come down the stairs she's sitting in the middle of the floor orange juice all over the floor and she's crying and i'm like honeymoon's over and we had a nice glass pitcher and it had a like a glass wand it's bubbled at the end and she put that frozen orange juice down in the thing and she was stirring it with this one and it the picture was so thin it cracked the side and it all flowed out the side of it and it's like you know the honeymoon life just comes at you you know that and then you get your first child and then it comes and you don't just have a love for your spouse but now you've got to divide that uh and it's just life it's seasons you're going through a season everybody y'all are just looking at me like yeah because every one of us are in seasons maybe we were once a kid and now like i'm not going to that party if there's if there's girls there and you went through a different season like i ain't going unless there's girls there maybe girls like no they got cooties like if they know guys they ain't going to that there's got to be some guys there don't it's just a season that you're going through a season of your life this is something and the bible says to everything there's a season thank god for the word of god there's a time to be born and time to die i was thinking of this brother rem said this right through this room is coming color every color shirt dress whatever you got on is eternal laying right on records going around and around the world every time you bat your eye it's on record watch television will prove it then he says this amazing thing i want you to understand this is in 1935 before the technology ever got there remember we read psalms 139 god knows your down settings your uprising he knows everything about you now prophet is coming in 1965 before this technology ever got here he said when you were born god sets a record on he didn't know how to say sd card and cameras and infrared lighting that even takes it in the in the dark he said he just said god puts a record on he said it don't make he said put a record on and it doesn't make much noise after a while you know and and that's a little baby till it comes to accountability then the noise starts he starts saying things listen to me young people he starts saying things and doing things that he has to answer for and when and when that life ends he said that record or that tape is taken off he didn't understand sd cards are you sticking in some of you have trail cameras we do back home and you track the deer and there's turkeys and there's a coyote and there's my neighbor and there's and you just pull the sd card brother and say that's what your life is when you start god puts something in a record he just had record players and he had a tape he didn't know what to call the technology but he's describing he's illustrating something that he's seeing he said there's a record there's a and he said and so he he said after your life ends it's taken off it's laid up in the great library of god now some of you have like uh now they you know i have um removable hard drives and i have it and i have it in my bag i accidentally stuck it in there it's got everything for my company and everything our life and pictures and all that stuff is laying in that cart in that little but now you have it in the cloud most of you put your data from don't even know where your pictures are they're just up there and i'm one of those old school guys like okay it's up there but i'm going to back it up so i own it you know because how many people i know my friend they changed their apple password and they lost all you know 20 000 pictures of their kids through five years of their life so i'm like oh i want to own those we don't even know where that but we believe listen to me we believe it's there and the prophet of god is telling us look when you're born there's a record that's put on and god is recording everything that you wear your thoughts he said and now how are you going to get around it on judgment at the judgment bar when it's played right back you every move you made every thought that went through your mind so it behooves us as we have this little season maybe just at a little hour brother daniel's here preaching say lord you really are recording not only my actions everything i wore everything i said but not only that but my thoughts sometimes you go into mcdonald's and they have the thing they turn the volume down and they just have their words transcribed and that's the way your thoughts are brother said at the judgment you come in the great canopy of god and they're the people that saints will judge the earth and they bring them in and there's the great candle lord i never thought that i am i've been a good person everybody sit down for a minute hey get the get the card out of the rack they come over all i can relate it to is the sd cards and he puts it in the player i just and he plays it back just goes through there's that person there they are in church there they are and their thoughts are like oh it's a bunch of nonsense wish we were out here he's too hard to preach that's a bunch of i hate this place any judgment needed no depart from me you worker of iniquity you see how but aren't you so thankful that there's something in the bible says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all i love the word all all unrighteousness so there's going to be blank spots on the tapes of the redeemed because they confess those little spots and god wipes the tape out oh blessed be the name of jesus aren't you thankful for the blood of jesus christ amen so the prophet of god is telling us look those tapes are there but the bible says that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from those sins they line them up i think it was brother borders might have been brother perry green came to brother branham said brother branham do you see everything in those people's lives that come up brotherhood said you know if they've confessed and it's under the blood i can't even see it god can't show it to me because god doesn't even know about oh that ought to just make us get up and run around and say blessed be the name of the lord i'm going to confess my sins lord i want them to be cleansed and erased from that great amen that that great tape that god has on that day amen so many things here i don't know how to get through it all i don't want to get through at all because i've been trying to be better i try to get better try to get better i've been trying to preach shorter but i thought about mother's day you know they're the first one that holds you first one to love you we should never ever disrespect our mother she held us under her heart for nine months before you breathed your first breath she was watching what going down the stairs with her baby she didn't want to trip because she was protecting you as teenagers we should never get in a place the chemicals kick in our mind that we would ever dis disrespect mom your mom say amen preach brother daniel and lower your voice when you do it but let it sink into these teenagers you should always the bible says i tell young people to say if you want to be a christian the evidence is you believe the word of god in ephesians 6 1 says children obey your parents in the lord don't ever call yourself a christian if you don't obey mom and dad and then mom and dad it behooves us to not make ridiculous rules for our children at 20 years old that they got to be in bed at 8 o'clock at night the bible says provoke not your children to wrath and so we grow up together as a family you go through sicknesses and good times and bad times you go through them together that's what happens somebody goes through a season and then adolph no we go through those things together as a church sometimes we go through we go through it together iron sharpened with iron well brother daniel i don't agree with that oh don't just do that wait just stick around you'll understand a little bit just talk you know let's talk through this sometimes you're misunderstood i was thinking about that because the bible says the scripture was written by holy men of god were moved by the holy ghost and then i was reading in second peter chapter three it talks about holy women so if holy men of god can be moved by the holy ghost and write the bible can't holy women be moved by the holy ghost and write and then script and change i was reading that this morning brother ram said the first preacher that ever gets a child is mother said there's five gospels matthew mark luke john and a mother should be a spirit-filled woman who can teach her children and teach them to pray and to know about god and so forth he said it's too bad that moms don't care about their children today and tell them bible stories he said it's hard to get a preacher that'll do that let alone a mother and he said if mothers would take more time to talk to their children about god and to pray for them we would have less juvenile delinquency he said first of all it's parent delinquency before we get juvenile delinquency if it said if mothers would take their their place in the home in the bible and pray for their children and lead them to christ he goes on to say i was listening to message mother's day it's just a really short message you said a child would listen to its mother he said some little touch about that mother and that child will listen to and when it's hurt it'll go to mother for consolation before it'll go to father oh i know that's true i got three boys they fall down and skin their knees blood right now like come on wipe it off we got to get this done right no they go to mama or their aaron's laughing over there i never had daughters so i don't i don't understand a lot of that but i'm learning you know and god help us all but it's a mother and he goes on to say because she was the first with it you know and there's some gift that god gives to a mother it's a gift that a man doesn't have and the world they want to make gender neutral and make everything neutral and all the same and you can take your right hand your left hand they look the same but they're different god made a man and a woman he made him different he gave gifts to a woman that a man could never ever achieve it's a special gift he goes on to say mother's day he said it's a racket they made a lot of money and flowers out of it but mother's day should be every day every day not just hey i'll send mom some flowers no we're gonna say to do more to sit down and talk to her call her on the phone say mom i love you thank you for every whipping you gave me i remember the one day my brother was two years old and he climbed up the stairs me and my brother slammed the door and hit him and he rolled all the way down the stairs she took us in there and she lined us up she said pull your trousers down i'm gonna whip you i said dad doesn't do it like this she said but i'm doing it like this and she made a an effect on my life mom has an effect brotherham said they're little treasures that god has given you the responsibility of raising and i always said and made this kind of saying we know that written gospels matthew mark luke and john but there is a fifth gospel unwritten and that's mother she gets them before matthew mark luke and john's teaching gets him so the responsibility is placed upon you mothers and you fathers to raise these children for a kingdom of god i woke up really early this morning went to bed late and woke up around five something my friend had texted me a minister and he sent me this quote he said a good praying mother or wife can do more for the kingdom of god on her knees at home than sometimes a preacher can do on the platform a praying wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of god on her knees at home than sometimes a preacher can do on the platform amen so there's something that you can do as a mom that the preacher can't do that the pastor can't do you can do it as a mom talking about seasons i just you know i was talking about sometimes brother perry green came here when he was 30 something years old and had a church and maybe many of you all went here and had him as a pastor and he thought this is going to be forever and now we realize that was just a season my friends grew up and brother branham was there and they said you know people believed him as god because you never had a problem whenever problem you had you just called brother branham and he prayed and your problem went away my father-in-law dallas you can hear it on the tape he run a stick through his ear he's squirrel hunt run a stick to his ear and bled a whole pillow of blood out in his ear he went to the doctor said your ear blends ear drums bursts so they called brother branham and brother branham just prayed said dallas your ears going to be all right he goes back to the doctor and his ear was completely here he healed his eardrum was healed he said we just our problems we just you know and we thought brother iran would be us forever and then they brother god took brother branham so that you would have faith will he find faith he delivered a message that all things are possible now you believe you pray you ask god and so i was thinking about that was just a season and sometimes you know we think about you know a season and and uh a time and you know we've talked about us being here for a time and a season and you know to bear one another's burdens and that's always been my burden is for the souls of people have one motive is that people would draw closer to jesus christ and i just you can see that my motive has been that that to draw people to closer to god or do whatever we can to draw people closer to god if we have a youth activity we come together and we read the bible and pray and conviction of the holy spirit and little nathan is there and in that conviction he gives his heart to the lord a few weeks later brother arnie baptizes him whatever we do is for the kingdom of god and i don't want to change my burden many churches are losing their identification they're changing their vision and it's about sports and activities and they build a a social club and a clan and they lose their original purpose of challenging people if they're ready to meet the lord jesus christ and not everybody wants a pastor and some people in this room maybe never had a pastor and i've said in the five-fold ministry people are changing the five-fold ministry to be apostle and prophet and evangelists and it was pastor and then teacher and they've changed the the p for pastor and they changed it to orator i want an orator i want to go to church once a week and i want somebody to deliver an oration to me and i want to leave and go home and so they think they have a pastor but they don't they have an orator and they're happy with the orator but a pastor is a shepherd like a father in the family paul talks about being a father in the gospel a shepherd of a soul to move a person from as they're on this journey to make it to a rapture so if we change that to an orator and we're just all together we're building a clan we're all coming together we feel good and say hey everybody's the bride and i get a better ship we're the bride we're the bride we're hallelujah we're the bride we're the bride and we all shout run the aisles we're the bride and then a real pastor says now wait a minute wait a minute you can say you're a brain surgeon but they have a whole if you say i want to go to school some of you have gone through nursing and you've done that and they they used to bring a whole set of books out now they probably said hey here's all the classes online but they stack a whole set of books down and they're this tall i say this this content is what makes you a brain surgeon you have to go through the books retain the information actually become the information and when you do that you're a brain surgeon so an orator just says we're the bride we're the bride i got all the quotes i got the message 12 minutes we're the bride but a pastor comes along and said look if you're the bride the bible says the bride made herself ready you have to go through the content become the content to be the bride is that fair to say so you can see how everybody wants an orator that just screams worth of bride as opposed to somebody says if you're a brain surgeon you'll go through the books become the content of the books remember john what is it 10 7 he took the book and gave it to john and he ate it the type of the bride it was sweet to his mouth i'm the bride but it was bitter in his belly it was bitter in his belly to say okay if you're the bride as young boy and girl getting married there's such a passion to be with the one they're going to marry they love him you write them a letter i want to open it i want to read it i want to what did he mean here what did he mean what i'm just so fascinated and then we have the bible and people don't even care about the word of god don't even care about being in the presence of god and in the church of god how can you be the bride and you love the world and the things of the world more than you love jesus christ so that's why we come to church and we check ourselves and there's a shepherd say are you really we say we're a brain surgeon but are you have you really gone through the books and become the books we say we're the bride but have we gone through the book and become the content of the book brother ram said this he said we he christ should be the principle theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our talks he should be the principal theme of our life if he's the principle theme of the bible and the bible's in us then he should be the principle theme of everything we do we say we think should be christ i know we get together we have kids we're cutting you all don't catch your grass you throw those rocks out there in the landscaping i love it i hate grass i hate weeds and see this grass and your landscaping just rocks and big rocks and little rocks and brown that's my kind of landscaping i like that and we all have those things in life and school and bills and troubles and that but the principle theme of all of that is jesus christ we all have to you know as the bible say we were reading it the other day in the bible i think it might be on ecclesiastes what comes to the animal comes to the human and that's right one dies and they all go to the grave but there's something greater than that we were made in the image of god we have a greater task than just raising children feeding them that's what animals do there's something greater than that as sons and daughters of god especially christians the world they just they show that their serpents see that's all they worry about is the animalistic but there's a christians made in the image of god they realize there is a purpose for them in life and we read it over there was the colossians on wednesday night how that he said that he wants to have a preeminence in a people he wants to be the primary thing of your thought now this isn't for everybody that's why this message isn't i can't see it i don't expect people to see it lot couldn't see what what abraham was saying but there was something abraham was up there was with the son of man ministry being revealed in his day and there's a people that are called to be the bride of christ i believe i'm going to believe that everyone in this room is called to be the bread of christ because something has drawn you here today the bible says no man can come except the father draws him and something knocked on your heart this morning and said get out of bed and go to church the bible says that that's not natural that's supernatural amen that god would deal with your heart amos and you'd obey your mama and you'd come to church and ride in a van and god would do something and amos says maybe he's like amos in the bible and he'll just be a a prophet of god he'd prophesy the coming of the lord and and each one of us i'm going to believe that god is dealing with our hearts and we're going through seasons each one of us going through seasons amen there's more here but we better save that for another service i'll turn that upside down 50 musicians will come that's the only way to get me to stop brother ram said this he preaches the message how can i overcome he said now i chose this because that i think that it's a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die and we're living in a time where they asked for the random brother and why can't i pray he said the revival is over and then the prophet of god said the way to overcome is keep the spirit of revival inside of you and if you've been camping and you burn it and it gets burnt down a little bit and the logs and it starts going out how do you create a revival brother david you just push those logs back together you push them together and it creates another revival and a great fire brother man says we've got to keep in revival constantly revived every day paul said that he had to die daily that christ might live and he said we must never say must never must never we daniel andes you must never let the spirit of revival die within us amen i say lord don't let me let the spirit of revival die so if you see me crying and lifting my hands or running the aisles or doing something like what are you doing i'm trying to keep the revival inside me i'm trying to keep the spirit revived inside of me i know the spirit of the world is ladies and to just roll over and become cool and and so i'm keeping the the logs together as we'd say i'm keeping the believers together and it's the same with the holy ghost on the day of pentecost who was it was standing here was talking about i was somewhere and they were talking about little licks of fire coming down on the individuals and when they they went out and witnessed but when you come together that's what church is it revives you you push those holy spirits together now you have a bonfire of believers that come together that renew our strength how's the bible say they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength they'll mount up with wings as an eagle amen may god help us let's bow our heads together heavenly father lord i've delivered what's been on my heart today father lord i have many many notes here but i pray god that you would just take the words that have been spoken the burden on my heart little experiences that i've been through with life godly mother godly father little stories lord and i pray that you would tuck them deep in our hearts or maybe there's a young person going through a season of their life they can't understand their life is changing their mind is changing their body is changing maybe someone else in the middle of their life and things are changing in their mind and their body i say brother daniel i understand what you're saying i i you're explaining to me what's happening in my life and in my mind maybe we're older lord and we're getting an ache and a pain and we go through a sickness and you heal us and maybe we don't come back as strong as we used to be father it's it's life father i pray you would strengthen us today you would help us lord we look at the scripture ecclesiastes chapter 3 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven help us today lord give us wisdom lord it's really quiet in here and that's when you speak to us your word says be still and know that i am god lord is the wisdom of god is coming down the aisle i pray that you would help us to open our heart up and capture it say lord bring that into my life lord when we go through times and our families when our wife won't listen to us anymore my husband just doesn't understand these kids they won't listen to me or we come in the presence of god and the holy spirit begins to deal with them and teenage rebellion goes out the window father as i was reading it yesterday and in the scripture i believe it's isaiah says that rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft lord take all rebellion away lord not only from the teenagers but someone that would rebel against the spirit of god i'm not doing that i'm not going to obey god's word i don't lord take that away today and give us a spirit of a lamb lord just really meek and humble lord i pray the holy spirit would just come in this room in a special way and touch our lives and help us lord this journey of life that we're going through lord i've just come to be a help along the journey to make life a little easier along the way father help us today maybe you're here today the holy spirit's dealing with you and you just like to raise your hand say lord you're speaking to me today i'm not going to embarrass you god bless you god bless you god bless you yes i'm going through a season in my life and i just want the lord to know that i want to be with him i want him to be with me god bless you god

you've put on my heart father lord hands have been raised you're dealing with lives lord we're complicated people we're going through seasons of our life and i pray you would help us through those

strengthen us today father i pray guide us through this time lord i pray we love you we dedicate our lives to you pray if there's any sin among us you'd forgive us lord lord i have both of my hands up

preach my notes on that but god heals my music and each one of you have gifts that god can use in the body of christ it's just not the anointed preacher it's just not the anointed musicians god wants to join every one of you with the holy spirit you have gifts and talents in your body we give a place i'll maybe talk about that a little later and god maybe he doesn't heal with brother daniel

brother said yeah that's right i've been in the way for 20 years another brother got up so that's right you've been in the way of god for 20 years so it's right to get in the right place and then saying i shall not be moved you don't want to be in the wrong place and say i shall not be moved if you're not on the winning side and a christian been baptized in jesus christ you know you need to
