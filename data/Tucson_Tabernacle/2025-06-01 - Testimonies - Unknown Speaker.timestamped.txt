[16:48] lot, but I never get tired of this song.
[16:50] Wasn't on the list. Amen.
[16:54] [Music]
[17:00] Even before moving here, this song just
[17:02] always made me think of Arizona cuz when
[17:05] we used to read the the supernatural
[17:07] books uh the story the life story of
[17:10] brother Brandham, he talked about being
[17:12] a young man out uh working on a cattle
[17:15] ranch and they would sleep under the
[17:17] stars out in the desert and this old
[17:20] cowboy would pull out a guitar and strum
[17:23] this song down at the cross where my
[17:25] savior died. So, I've always thought
[17:27] about Arizona, not knowing I was going
[17:29] to end up here one day. But more
[17:31] importantly, I think about what the Lord
[17:33] did for us, right? Amen. Let's sing
[17:36] this.
[17:38] Down at the cross where my Savior
[17:43] died. Down where for cleansing from sin
[17:48] I

[23:46] He touched me. Kia D.
[23:50] I was
[23:51] shackled by a
[23:55] heavy
[23:59] burden neath the load of
[24:03] guilt and
[24:09] shame. Then the hand of
[24:13] Jesus touched
[24:17] me and now I am no
[24:22] longer the
[24:26] same. Oh, he touched
[24:30] me.
[24:32] Oh, he touched me.
[24:37] And
[24:39] all the joy that floods my
[24:46] soul.
[24:48] Something
[24:50] happened. And
[24:52] now I
[24:55] know he touched
[24:57] me and
[24:59] made me
[25:02] whole. Since I've met Sister Naomi. Oh,
[25:06] since I met this
[25:10] blessed
[25:14] Savior, and

[26:26] So, I've been
[26:27] uh reading the um Christ is a mystery of
[26:31] God revealed and and then also another
[26:33] book that speaks of the plan of
[26:35] redemption and this song came to mind.
[26:38] If you guys know it, sing it with us.
[26:40] Um, but it just kind of
[26:43] speaks with the plan of redemption
[26:46] and how it is finished and the battle is
[26:49] over and you when Christ died, it was
[26:53] finished. The plan of
[26:54] redemption. This song's been on my
[26:56] heart. So, I want to sing it tonight.
[27:00] [Music]
[27:03] There's a
[27:04] line that is drawn through the
[27:12] angels. On that
[27:15] line stands an old
[27:18] ruging cross.
[27:21] [Music]
[27:23] On that
[27:25] cross, a
[27:28] battle is raing
[27:31] [Music]
[27:33] for the
[27:35] gain of men's
[27:37] soul for its loss.
[27:41] [Music]
[27:43] On one
[27:45] side are the
[27:47] fores of evil.
[27:53] all the
[27:54] demons, all the
[27:57] devils of hell
[28:02] and on the
[28:04] other the
[28:06] angels of glory
[28:12] and they
[28:14] meet on
[28:17] God's hill.
[28:22] The earth
[28:23] shakes with the force of the
[28:28] [Music]
[28:30] conflict and the
[28:33] sun
[28:35] refuses to shine.
[28:41] For there hangs God's son in the
[28:49] balance. And
[28:51] in through the darkness he
[28:59] cries, "It is
[29:01] finished. The
[29:04] battle is
[29:08] over. It is finished.
[29:12] There'll be no more
[29:17] war. It is
[29:20] finished. The end of the conflict.
[29:28] It is
[29:29] finished and
[29:32] Jesus is
[29:36] Lord. Yet in my
[29:39] heart the battle was still raised.
[29:45] Jean, not all
[29:48] prisoners of war had come
[29:55] home. These were
[29:58] battlefields of my own
[30:04] making. I didn't
[30:06] know that the war had been won.
[30:14] But then I
[30:16] heard that the King of the
[30:22] Asian, he had
[30:25] won all my
[30:27] battles for
[30:31] me. And the
[30:34] victory is mine for the claiming.
[30:42] And
[30:43] now praise his name. I am
[30:47] [Applause]
[30:49] free. Cuz it is
[30:52] finished. The
[30:55] battle is
[30:59] over. It is finished
[31:01] this. There'll be no more.
[31:09] It is
[31:10] finished. The end of the
[31:17] conflict. It is
[31:19] finished. And
[31:22] Jesus is over.
[31:26] Oh, it is
[31:28] finished. The
[31:31] battle is
[31:35] over. It is finished.
[31:38] There will be no more
[31:44] war. It is
[31:46] finished. The end of the
[31:52] conflict. Oh, it is
[31:55] finished. And
[31:57] Jesus is
[32:01] Lord. It is finished.
[32:05] And
[32:06] Jesus is
[32:09] Lord.
[32:10] Jesus is
[32:14] [Music]
[32:20] [Applause]
[32:28] Lord. Thank you for that. Was wonderful.
[32:30] Let's sing the
[32:31] blood. Another one I didn't send back
[32:35] before the service. The blood will never
[32:37] lose its
[32:39] [Music]
[32:45] power. Verse
[32:49] one. Oh, the
[32:52] blood that
[32:54] Jesus
[32:57] shed for me.
[33:02] Oh, way back on
[33:08] Calary. The blood that gives me
[33:13] strength from
[33:15] day to
[33:17] day. It will
[33:20] never
[33:22] lose its power. Let's sing that first
[33:25] verse again. The
[33:26] blood. The
[33:29] blood that
[33:32] Jesus
[33:34] shed for
[33:38] me. Oh, way back on
[33:46] Calary. The blood that gives me
[33:50] strength from
[33:53] day to day.
[33:56] It will
[33:58] never
[33:59] lose its
[34:02] power. Aren't you thankful for that? Oh,
[34:05] it
[34:06] reaches to the
[34:09] highest
[34:13] mountain. Oh, and it
[34:15] flows to the
[34:18] lowest valley.
[34:21] [Music]
[34:23] The blood that gives me
[34:27] strength from
[34:29] day to
[34:31] day. It will
[34:34] never
[34:36] lose its
[34:38] power. Sister hope, if you'd come, get
[34:41] ready. It
[34:43] soothes my
[34:45] doubts and
[34:48] calms my fears.
[34:53] Oh, and it dries
[34:57] all my
[34:59] tears. The blood that gives me
[35:03] strength from
[35:06] day to
[35:08] day. It will
[35:11] never
[35:12] lose its
[35:15] power. For it reaches for it reaches
[35:19] [Music]
[35:26] mountain and it
[35:28] flows to the
[35:31] lowest
[35:35] valley. Oh, the blood that gives me
[35:40] strength from

[35:58] highest
[36:02] mountain. Oh, and it
[36:05] flows to the
[36:07] lowest valley.
[36:12] The blood that gives me
[36:16] strength from
[36:18] day to
[36:20] day. It will

[37:18] I wanted to say that um um this song I
[37:22] chose it
[37:24] because I don't want hope buckles to
[37:26] exist anymore but Christ and Christ
[37:29] alone to be lived through me. Brother
[37:31] Graham said that we can live so close to
[37:33] the Lord that the devil doesn't know
[37:36] what to do with us. And that's what
[37:39] we're all looking to the Lord to
[37:41] transform us into.

[46:45] [Music]
[47:03] I searched the
[47:07] world but it couldn't fail
[47:13] me. Man's empty praise and treasures of
[47:18] fate are never
[47:23] enough. Then you came
[47:28] along and put me back
[47:34] together. Every desire is now satisfied.
[47:40] here in
[47:45] love. Oh, there's
[47:48] nothing better than you. There's
[47:53] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[47:58] nothing nothing is better than you.
[48:03] [Music]
[48:06] I'm not afraid.
[48:11] to show you our
[48:15] weakness, my failures and flaws. Lord,
[48:18] you see them fall and you still call
[48:22] [Applause]
[48:25] me. Cuz the God of the
[48:29] mountain is the God of the valley.
[48:36] There's not a place your mercy and grace
[48:41] won't find me again.
[48:46] Oh, there's
[48:49] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[48:53] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[48:58] nothing nothing is better than you.
[49:06] Oh, there's
[49:08] nothing better than you. There's
[49:13] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[49:17] nothing nothing is better than you.
[49:22] [Music]
[49:26] You turn mourning to
[49:30] dancing. You give beauty for
[49:34] ashes. You turn shame into
[49:38] glory. You're the only one who
[49:44] cares. You turn mourning to
[49:49] dancing. You give beauty for ashes.
[49:54] You turn shame to
[49:57] glory. You're the only one who can.
[50:08] There's
[50:09] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[50:13] nothing
[50:15] better than you, Lord. There's
[50:19] nothing nothing is better than you.
[50:26] Oh, there's
[50:28] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[50:33] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[50:38] nothing nothing is better than you.
[50:48] [Music]
[50:50] [Applause]
[50:56] Praise the Lord. Let's just give another
[50:58] hand for all those wonderful
[51:02] specials. Key is here. I believe key of
[51:05] G or key of G I think. Let's just stand
[51:09] one more time.
[51:12] be sitting a lot during this service.
[51:14] Just as we sing this song, Brother
[51:15] Daniel's gonna take it from here. Let's
[51:17] sing this. He is here.
[51:20] Hallelujah. He is
[51:24] here.
[51:28] Hallelu. He is
[51:32] here.
[51:34] [Music]
[51:36] Amen. He is here.
[51:42] Holy,
[51:45] holy, I will
[51:48] bless his
[51:50] name
[51:51] again. Oh, he is
[51:56] here.
[51:58] Listen
[52:00] closely. Hear him
[52:04] calling out your name.
[52:08] He is
[52:11] he.
[52:13] You can touch him. You will
[52:19] never be the same. One more time. He is
[52:27] here.
[52:31] Hallelu. He is here.
[52:38] Amen. He is
[52:42] here.
[52:44] Holy,
[52:46] holy, I will
[52:49] bless his
[52:51] name
[52:59] again. Listen
[53:01] closely. Hear him
[53:05] calling out your
[53:09] name. He is
[53:13] here. You can touch
[53:17] him. You will
[53:20] never
[53:22] be the same. Amen.
[53:27] There's no service that is complete
[53:29] without reading the word of God. Let's
[53:32] open our
[53:34] Bibles to the book of
[53:37] Psalms. Let's go to Psalm 1.
[53:40] [Music]
[53:46] [Music]
[53:52] Psalm
[53:54] 1, it reads like this.
[54:00] Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[54:03] the counsel of the
[54:05] ungodly, nor standeth in the way of
[54:08] sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the
[54:11] scornful, but his delight is in the law
[54:13] of the Lord, and in his law does he
[54:17] meditate day and night.
[54:20] [Music]
[54:21] And he shall be like a tree planted by
[54:24] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[54:27] his fruit. In his season, his leaf also
[54:30] shall not wither, and whatsoever he
[54:32] doeth shall prosper. The ungodly are not
[54:36] so, but are like the chaff, which the
[54:39] wind driveth away. Therefore the ungodly
[54:43] shall not stand in the judgment, nor
[54:45] sinners in the congregation of the
[54:47] righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way
[54:50] of the righteous, but the way of the
[54:53] ungodly shall perish. Amen. You can be
[54:56] [Music]
[54:59] seated. The word of
[55:03] God written in in the Psalms. And what a
[55:06] way it is to start that
[55:08] book. So tonight we will um we'll share
[55:12] a few testimonies. Uh, brother Paul,
[55:15] I'll give a testimony first and then uh
[55:18] if you would come up after I give a
[55:20] testimony and then I would like Josiah
[55:23] to go after you and then I will take the
[55:26] microphone into the audience and and we
[55:28] can share more testimonies. I
[55:31] just I wanted to thank the Lord.
[55:35] I got a friend here and Heath and I have
[55:40] we were friends a long time ago
[55:43] and we uh spent a lot of time in the
[55:47] mountains together and a lot of time
[55:49] just fellowshipping and rejoicing in the
[55:53] Lord and laughing and and just just
[55:56] feeling good.
[55:58] And I ended up leaving Tucson, moved to
[56:04] Jeffersonville. And
[56:07] after I don't know, 16 years
[56:11] there, I I just had it on my heart, I
[56:14] got to come back
[56:15] home.
[56:17] And I was praying that way. And and when
[56:20] the Lord lays something on your heart,
[56:23] it's best to pray about it and then give
[56:26] it
[56:27] time because we will make mistakes. No
[56:31] matter how sure you may be of
[56:34] something, still keep putting this into
[56:38] the hands of the Lord and and asking
[56:40] Lord, is this just me or is this you?
[56:45] And it was the
[56:47] Lord that um that he wanted us to come
[56:51] back home to
[56:53] Tucson. And he opened up the door and as
[56:57] soon as I was offered the position that
[57:00] I I
[57:01] have he
[57:03] um I started praying, Lord, I'd like to
[57:06] see Heath again.
[57:08] I uh I miss him and and I would go back
[57:11] to the good times that we used to have
[57:13] in the mountains and and the friendship
[57:15] that we had and and I started calling
[57:17] friends. I called my brother-in-law
[57:19] David who was a deacon at North Side
[57:21] when you were there and and he gave me a
[57:23] phone number. The phone number didn't
[57:24] work. And if you know brother Heath, his
[57:27] phone numbers work for about one month
[57:29] and uh then he gets a new one. Two
[57:32] months. All right. Well, I'm sorry.
[57:34] Sorry, brother. I didn't mean
[57:36] to underestimate
[57:39] you, but no, nobody everybody I called
[57:44] um didn't know where he
[57:47] was. And I had heard that no, Heath had
[57:51] uh had backsliden and hadn't hadn't been
[57:53] serving God and and he had had some
[57:55] trouble in life. And and my heart just
[57:59] really started to burn. I I really
[58:03] wanted to see my friend
[58:05] again.
[58:07] So we come out here and started
[58:09] attending shalom church um with brother
[58:14] Po as pastor and and asked around
[58:17] there. No, nobody get in touch with
[58:21] Heath. And I thought, "Oh Lord, I just
[58:25] it's longing in my heart. I want to see
[58:28] my old friend."
[58:31] And brother Israel had asked me to
[58:35] speak and I was uh it was on my heart
[58:39] and that even that day I wanted to see
[58:43] my friend and it had been
[58:48] uh probably 16 years since we had seen
[58:51] each other since we' even talked. And
[58:55] that day, that morning, I woke up and I
[58:59] he was on really on my heart. I asked
[59:02] the Lord, "Lord, please let me see him."
[59:06] And I believe it was that
[59:08] evening, this big bearded guy walks into
[59:12] service. I look out there and it's
[59:15] Heath. And I know, friend, that the Lord
[59:19] answers our prayers.
[59:21] And and brother, let me tell you, we're
[59:24] in this
[59:25] together. And we love each other. And
[59:29] pray for one another, friends. If you
[59:32] have a burden on your heart from an old
[59:34] for an old friend or a family member or
[59:36] whatever it might
[59:38] be, reach reach out that hand. the book
[59:42] of
[59:44] Jude, it uh Jude is is saying that he
[59:50] says this. He says, "But ye beloved,
[59:53] building up yourselves on your most holy
[59:56] faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep
[59:58] yourselves in the love of God, looking
[1:00:00] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:03] unto eternal life." And of some have
[1:00:06] compassion making a
[1:00:09] difference and others save with
[1:00:12] fear pulling them out of the
[1:00:15] fire hating even the garment spotted by
[1:00:19] the flesh. We need to be willing friends
[1:00:23] if if you have a burden on your heart
[1:00:26] for someone a loved one you got to be
[1:00:29] willing even to put your hand in the
[1:00:31] fire. And if you put your hand in the
[1:00:33] fire, you're probably going to get
[1:00:35] burned. But it's worth it. It's worth
[1:00:38] trying. It's worth reaching out. I just
[1:00:41] seen you here, Elijah, and um I just
[1:00:46] brings me back a long time ago when
[1:00:48] you're just a a baby, right? Yeah. and
[1:00:51] you came over to our house and Heath
[1:00:54] uh was a little
[1:00:57] late, walked
[1:00:59] up, knocked on the door and I looked at
[1:01:02] him and he was distraught. He looked
[1:01:04] really bad. We were having him over for
[1:01:05] dinner. You know, me and Stephanie were
[1:01:06] recently married and we we had um we've
[1:01:09] been married a couple years and we had
[1:01:11] at least Meline. I think we probably had
[1:01:12] Daniel, too. and we had these these two
[1:01:15] babies and we were excited in our house
[1:01:17] and we're having Heath over and and he
[1:01:20] walks up and the first thing he said
[1:01:23] was, "Dude, Bria threw up in the in the
[1:01:28] van. That's what kids do when they all
[1:01:31] over." Oh man, it was just Praise God,
[1:01:35] you know. Praise God for friends and and
[1:01:38] good times. And Elijah, I think you were
[1:01:40] just a little squirt, you know, then.
[1:01:42] And you know, I'm probably tearing stuff
[1:01:44] up in my
[1:01:47] house, but uh bro, it's good to see you,
[1:01:50] Heath, you know, and and um we're going
[1:01:54] to get through this life together, and
[1:01:56] we're going to I firmly believe we're
[1:01:57] going to sit across that table at that
[1:01:59] wedding supper, and we're just going to
[1:02:02] rejoice in all the the greatness of the
[1:02:04] things that have happened here. Um,
[1:02:07] brother Paul, if you would come up.
[1:02:08] Brother Paul shared a testimony with us
[1:02:10] with me this morning, and I thought this
[1:02:12] would be really good for the the church
[1:02:15] to hear. As I said earlier, we're having
[1:02:17] a testimony service tonight.
[1:02:20] Um, so feel free as the Lord leads you
[1:02:23] to share a short testimony with us when
[1:02:26] when we get out and I start bringing the
[1:02:27] microphone around in the audience. God
[1:02:30] bless you.
[1:02:36] Well, this is a little bit of a
[1:02:38] surprise. I didn't know I was going to
[1:02:40] be called up
[1:02:42] here.
[1:02:43] Um, this morning I shared with brother
[1:02:46] Daniel that,
[1:02:49] um, in the middle of the service, uh, I
[1:02:53] had written down I use my journal to
[1:02:55] take notes while in church and also to
[1:02:58] do my devotionals in the morning. And
[1:03:02] uh on the same entry for today, I had I
[1:03:06] had completely forgotten about all the
[1:03:08] stuff that I had written this morning.
[1:03:10] And uh in the middle of the service, at
[1:03:13] some point
[1:03:14] um the Holy Spirit kept nudging me to go
[1:03:18] back and read what I had written this
[1:03:20] morning for my devotionals. And it just
[1:03:23] really tickled me because of the the
[1:03:25] Lord just I totally forgot what I had
[1:03:27] written and it just went perfectly with
[1:03:29] the service. And I I had no idea where
[1:03:33] brother Daniel would be going this
[1:03:34] morning, but I'll just go ahead and
[1:03:37] share with you uh what I wrote this
[1:03:39] morning in my journal. Um but to give
[1:03:43] you a little bit
[1:03:44] of insight,
[1:03:48] um I don't think any of us really feel
[1:03:51] like we have an an amazing prayer life.
[1:03:57] Um I myself I know every day um every
[1:04:02] moment um I'm communing with the Holy
[1:04:05] Spirit.
[1:04:06] Um but I'm still not content. And when
[1:04:10] it comes to my actual private time, I'm
[1:04:13] definitely not
[1:04:15] satisfied. Uh I could I hope I hope that
[1:04:20] I have that hunger every day.
[1:04:24] Um, but I expressed that here in my
[1:04:28] journal. So, I don't The reason I'm
[1:04:30] giving you a little bit of insight is
[1:04:31] because you're gonna Oh, wait. Paul
[1:04:33] doesn't have a prayer life. Anyway, this
[1:04:37] is my entry. And I I didn't write this
[1:04:39] for you all. This is this is personal,
[1:04:41] but it's good. It'll bless you.
[1:04:44] Uh and sometimes um also when when I go
[1:04:48] to to put an entry in sometimes I
[1:04:52] just and you may experience this as well
[1:04:55] um you just release yourself to the Holy
[1:05:00] Spirit. And for me sometimes I wish it
[1:05:03] happened more often than it does but I
[1:05:06] just it feels like the Lord is riding
[1:05:08] through me because none of it's
[1:05:09] premeditated. And that's what happened
[1:05:11] here.
[1:05:13] You're feeling
[1:05:15] like you're feeling like you're lukewarm
[1:05:17] or backslid because you don't have a
[1:05:19] prayer life, but God isn't measuring
[1:05:21] your performance. It's not about you.
[1:05:25] Get your focus off your stinking no good
[1:05:27] self. You are dead and your life is now
[1:05:29] so hid in God that Jesus Christ can't
[1:05:32] even see you. You're not all that
[1:05:34] important. I don't know why you pay so
[1:05:37] much attention to you. Don't you know
[1:05:40] you become what you behold?
[1:05:44] You are accepted in the beloved. It is
[1:05:47] impossible to please God except by
[1:05:49] faith. You know something you said
[1:05:52] earlier, Sister Hope, before you sang
[1:05:54] that song, it just hit me. I I was like,
[1:05:57] I got to tell her this, but I don't
[1:05:59] remember exactly what you said, but we
[1:06:01] all want to die, right? But the fact is,
[1:06:04] you're already dead.
[1:06:07] It's not about It's not about your
[1:06:09] performance. It's not about you. Did
[1:06:12] Christ die?
[1:06:14] There's there's where you are. Did he
[1:06:17] rise again?
[1:06:19] There you go. Your life and and it was
[1:06:23] preached this morning so beautifully.
[1:06:26] Colossians 3:3, for you are dead and
[1:06:28] your life is hid where
[1:06:32] I I'm not called to preach, but boy, I
[1:06:34] could. Um,
[1:06:37] is there any darkness at all in Christ?
[1:06:40] No.
[1:06:42] reach you. Yeah, I can't. I wish I
[1:06:47] could. But you know this is this is all
[1:06:51] really good
[1:06:53] and there but there is a point where
[1:06:56] this becomes it drops to 18 in and the
[1:07:00] prophet called it stimulation of
[1:07:02] revelation. I often call it the joy of
[1:07:05] my salvation.
[1:07:07] And I I'm telling you the honest truth.
[1:07:09] There probably I doubt there's a day
[1:07:11] that goes by where I'm not just crying
[1:07:14] out to God
[1:07:15] for the joy of my salvation to be
[1:07:18] restored or that stimulation of
[1:07:20] revelation. I need it every day. And
[1:07:23] when this very simple message hits the
[1:07:27] 18 in, that's salvation. That's the
[1:07:31] stimulation of revelation. And that's
[1:07:33] what we all need. And
[1:07:36] uh I'm crying out for it right now.
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:46] It blessed me
[1:07:47] that he was writing this before even the
[1:07:51] sermon this morning which was on
[1:07:52] Colossians chapter 3. And he quoted to
[1:07:56] himself, I don't even know if he knew
[1:07:58] where this scripture was, but it was my
[1:08:00] opening scripture this morning. for you
[1:08:02] are dead and your life is hid with
[1:08:04] Christ in God. You know, when we when we
[1:08:07] don't when we're searching for something
[1:08:10] and and and there's something in us that
[1:08:13] is crying out and sometimes it feels so
[1:08:16] much it's like Lord, are you even
[1:08:17] listening to me? I haven't had an
[1:08:19] experience in a long time. I'm I'm just
[1:08:22] Lord, I'm just going through life. Is my
[1:08:24] life worth anything? Lord, what about
[1:08:26] me? It's been so long since you've
[1:08:30] spoken with me. And
[1:08:32] then in time, many times the time you
[1:08:35] least expect it, he steps in and he
[1:08:41] says, "No, son. No, daughter. I'm here."
[1:08:45] And then he might give you a scripture.
[1:08:47] He might give you a word like he gave to
[1:08:50] brother Paul. When brother Paul told me
[1:08:52] this
[1:08:52] testimony, I thought, you know,
[1:08:55] Josiah has a has a similar one. And so I
[1:08:59] asked brother Josiah, I said, "Hey,
[1:09:01] would you mind
[1:09:03] sharing the sharing your testimony of
[1:09:06] some of the things that you wrote down?"
[1:09:08] And Josiah was he was struggling with
[1:09:11] the same thing that I just said that I
[1:09:12] struggle with many many all the time
[1:09:15] like, "Lord, where are you? Have you
[1:09:17] forgotten about me? are you going to
[1:09:20] speak to me? And then the Lord blessed
[1:09:23] our brother and I want him to share his
[1:09:25] testimony now very similar to brother
[1:09:31] Paul's. When I told brother Daniel this
[1:09:35] testimony, I actually instantly
[1:09:37] regretted it.
[1:09:39] Um I would much rather
[1:09:43] sing. It's it's just that doesn't make
[1:09:46] me nervous, but to talk
[1:09:49] You know, a few words between each song
[1:09:50] is fine, but to actually share a whole
[1:09:54] length speaking
[1:09:56] words, don't envy I don't envy it at
[1:09:59] all. Um, one thing and and what brother
[1:10:03] Daniel said is exactly right. It, you
[1:10:06] know, there was a a long time even over
[1:10:09] the last couple years where it's like,
[1:10:11] man, I don't feel like I've uh heard
[1:10:13] from the Lord.
[1:10:17] But the funny thing is, and what I feel
[1:10:19] like the Lord kind of opened my eyes to
[1:10:22] was uh hearing from the Lord is your
[1:10:27] choice.
[1:10:29] Hearing from the Lord's your choice. I
[1:10:32] repeat myself a lot if you haven't
[1:10:33] noticed. So, I'll say the same thing
[1:10:35] three or four times in a row for my
[1:10:37] benefit. Just be patient with me. But if
[1:10:40] I was gonna say to my wife, I haven't
[1:10:43] heard from brother Lyall in a long
[1:10:46] time. Why is that? Why haven't I heard
[1:10:49] from Brother Lyle? She's like, "Well,
[1:10:50] have you called him? Have you gone to go
[1:10:53] get coffee with him? Have you invited
[1:10:55] him out to eat? Have you asked him
[1:10:57] something? Have you asked him a
[1:10:58] question? How how's the family doing,
[1:11:00] Brother Ly?" To to get a response, it's
[1:11:03] my choice to do that. And if I don't do
[1:11:07] that, I might never hear from him. And
[1:11:10] that's that is your choice. So, Brother
[1:11:13] Daniel preached a few weeks back that
[1:11:17] uh he got up. He's changed something in
[1:11:20] his life that he got up a half hour
[1:11:22] before he was supposed to get up and
[1:11:25] that
[1:11:26] week. So, so he said that he would he
[1:11:28] would get up a half hour before he
[1:11:30] usually got up and dedicate that time to
[1:11:32] the Lord. So, that was a Sunday. And I
[1:11:34] thought, man, I should do that. But that
[1:11:36] week I had a pretty big job and I had to
[1:11:38] get up really early every morning to
[1:11:40] beat the heat on the job site. And so I
[1:11:43] was like, so I'm already getting up at
[1:11:46] 4:45. So then I'd have to get up in half
[1:11:49] hour earlier than that. And I was like,
[1:11:52] I'm going to do it. And I had that whole
[1:11:54] week. I was like, I'm going to do it
[1:11:56] every day this week and get up and
[1:12:00] uh start breakfast and then just take a
[1:12:03] half hour or even 20 minutes and just
[1:12:05] give that time to the
[1:12:07] Lord. And what do you know? He'll talk
[1:12:10] back. When you reach out, he'll also
[1:12:14] reach out. And so I was like, well, what
[1:12:18] do I read? He's kind of just sitting
[1:12:20] down there
[1:12:22] like I could just read the verse of the
[1:12:24] day or do something like that. But
[1:12:27] that's not really that's not that's not
[1:12:30] going to sustain you. Just getting up
[1:12:32] and reading the verse of the day every
[1:12:33] day. That's fine. But you need to have
[1:12:36] your own personal plan. say, "I'm gonna
[1:12:38] read I'm gonna start Matthew 1, and
[1:12:41] tomorrow I'm going to read Matthew 2,
[1:12:43] and the next day I'm going to read
[1:12:45] Matthew 3 and go through it for what the
[1:12:47] Bible wants to tell you, not for the
[1:12:48] program that feeds you the verse a day.
[1:12:50] Might be
[1:12:52] fine. I
[1:12:55] can't." But
[1:12:58] uh, see, now that threw me off. I was I
[1:13:01] was I was moving, but I I was just like,
[1:13:05] "Okay, Colossians
[1:13:08] So, I started reading Colossians. And
[1:13:11] what do you know, brother Daniel? I
[1:13:13] didn't know he was going to start
[1:13:14] Colossians, but I started reading
[1:13:16] Colossians that week a few verses at a
[1:13:18] time, getting through working my way
[1:13:20] through the chapter. And then, Brother
[1:13:21] Daniel comes out. We're starting this
[1:13:22] series on Colossians, and it was like,
[1:13:24] "Oh, I haven't had something like that
[1:13:26] happen in a long time." It was so
[1:13:28] wonderful. And then I say all that
[1:13:32] because I I feel like the Lord really
[1:13:34] showed me this last night.
[1:13:37] after Katie had fallen asleep and uh I
[1:13:41] was lying there in bed and Psalm 1,
[1:13:44] which brother Daniel read, which he knew
[1:13:46] I was going to talk about Psalm 1, so he
[1:13:48] thought it would be a good idea to read
[1:13:49] it, which is uh blessed is the man who
[1:13:52] walks not in the counsel of the
[1:13:55] ungodly, nor stands in the way of
[1:13:58] sinners, nor sits in the seat of the
[1:14:02] scornful, but his delight is in the law
[1:14:06] of the Lord. Amen. And in his law he
[1:14:09] meditates day and night. Amen. And he
[1:14:12] shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:14:15] rivers of water. That bringeth forth
[1:14:18] fruit in his
[1:14:19] season. His leaf also shall not wither,
[1:14:23] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
[1:14:26] Sounds sounds too good to be true. The
[1:14:29] ungodly are not
[1:14:30] so, but are like the chaff which the
[1:14:33] wind driveth away.
[1:14:36] Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand
[1:14:37] in the judgment, nor sinners in the
[1:14:40] congregation of the
[1:14:43] righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way
[1:14:45] of the
[1:14:46] righteous, but the way of the ungodly
[1:14:49] shall
[1:14:51] perish. I just want to take a little bit
[1:14:53] to explain how this was so convicting to
[1:14:58] me.
[1:14:59] The first half of this, the first half,
[1:15:02] if we could go back to verse
[1:15:04] one, blessed is the man that walketh not
[1:15:07] in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
[1:15:08] standeth. So those three things, they
[1:15:10] all have to do with others. They all
[1:15:13] have to do with other people. This this
[1:15:15] hypothetical person could be us during
[1:15:18] different parts of our lives who is
[1:15:20] standing in the way of sinners who is
[1:15:22] walking in the counsel of the
[1:15:24] ungodly and eventually sitting in the
[1:15:28] seat of the
[1:15:29] scornful.
[1:15:31] Now the first part you're actually
[1:15:35] taking an action. You're walking in the
[1:15:37] counsel of the ungodly. You're choosing
[1:15:39] to do that. And same with the standing
[1:15:41] in the way of sinners. You're choosing
[1:15:42] to take a
[1:15:43] stand. And then the third part, you're
[1:15:46] sitting, which there's so much could be
[1:15:49] said about that cuz now you're not even
[1:15:52] standing for anything
[1:15:54] anymore. You're just sitting and you're
[1:15:57] scorn. You're being scornful about
[1:15:58] others who choose to take a
[1:16:01] stand. I'm going somewhere with this.
[1:16:04] Nevertheless, you're choosing. You are
[1:16:05] you are choosing. I'm going to sit in
[1:16:07] the seat of the scornful. And the second
[1:16:09] half isn't like that at all. So if you
[1:16:11] could put up verse
[1:16:13] two, but his delight, so instead of
[1:16:17] that, his delight is in the law of the
[1:16:22] Lord. Nobody else involved. The first
[1:16:26] part walking in the counsel of the
[1:16:28] ungodly. You're with you're in the way
[1:16:29] of sinners. You're in the seat of the
[1:16:31] scornful. This part has nothing to do
[1:16:32] with anyone else. It says, "This man's
[1:16:35] delight is in the law of the
[1:16:38] Lord, and in his law doth he meditate
[1:16:41] day and
[1:16:46] night." First half's amongst others. The
[1:16:49] second half is completely personal and
[1:16:51] it doesn't require anyone else to do
[1:16:52] anything for you. Now, I wanted to come
[1:16:56] to church and just let the Lord speak to
[1:16:58] me through the pastor, through the
[1:17:00] songs, through whatever it was. But this
[1:17:03] is a personal thing. This man is
[1:17:04] choosing to delight. That's the other
[1:17:07] thing. Delighting in the law of the Lord
[1:17:09] is a choice.
[1:17:11] You choose what you're going to delight
[1:17:13] in. I heard a story about a guy who
[1:17:15] didn't like seafood, but the more he ate
[1:17:18] it, the more he liked it. It's simple.
[1:17:20] You choose whether you're going to
[1:17:22] delight in the law of the Lord, whether
[1:17:24] you are going to make that happen,
[1:17:25] whether you're going to make the time to
[1:17:26] hear from brother
[1:17:28] Lyall. Now, it is a choice to meditate
[1:17:31] on the law of the Lord. The other thing
[1:17:32] I want to say is David when he wrote
[1:17:37] this
[1:17:38] had
[1:17:41] Leviticus and
[1:17:43] Deuteronomy and Numbers and Genesis.
[1:17:48] He didn't even have
[1:17:51] Isaiah,
[1:17:53] Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, much less the
[1:17:57] Gospels. So he's saying to meditate on
[1:18:01] those five books of
[1:18:04] Moses. Can you imagine? David is saying
[1:18:07] this, this man's delight is in those
[1:18:10] things. And we have volumes of the
[1:18:12] greatest story ever told to sit and
[1:18:15] meditate on day and night. And what
[1:18:18] happens when you do this next
[1:18:21] verse? He shall be like a tree
[1:18:25] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:18:28] bringeth forth fruit in his season.
[1:18:30] He'll be like a tree because what is
[1:18:32] what is a tree that's constantly by the
[1:18:34] water? Is constantly getting fed. It's
[1:18:36] constantly drinking. So, you're choosing
[1:18:38] to meditate on these things. And if
[1:18:40] you're like a tree in this metaphor and
[1:18:42] you're choosing to med you're choosing
[1:18:44] to meditate on these things day and
[1:18:46] night, it's like you're just being
[1:18:47] watered
[1:18:49] nonstop. Non-stop hearing from God
[1:18:52] non-stop. No wonder no wonder it says
[1:18:54] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. If
[1:18:56] you are constantly meditating on the
[1:18:59] things of God, constantly thinking in
[1:19:02] each you're, you know, you're going to
[1:19:03] work, you're driving there, you're
[1:19:05] coming home, whatever you're doing,
[1:19:06] decisions you're making day and night,
[1:19:08] meditating on his
[1:19:11] word. No wonder whatever. No, whatever.
[1:19:14] Now it the thing I thought about
[1:19:17] is but wait a minute we all go through
[1:19:21] hard
[1:19:22] times and it's not always going to be
[1:19:26] easy and I often use that type of thing
[1:19:29] as an excuse. Well, this is just a hard
[1:19:31] time. This is just a low point. But it
[1:19:34] says you continue to do this and it'll
[1:19:37] bring forth fruit in the in the season.
[1:19:40] So if you take two people that have been
[1:19:42] dished a hard time like say Hitler and
[1:19:44] Abraham
[1:19:46] Lincoln, they both lost their
[1:19:49] mothers. They both lost Hitler lost his
[1:19:53] older brother or his younger brother who
[1:19:54] was his best friend. Abraham Lincoln
[1:19:57] lost uh the girl who he wanted to marry
[1:19:59] who he was deeply in love with. Two two
[1:20:02] completely opposite people who were fed
[1:20:05] very terrible things. One his life grew
[1:20:10] up reading the Bible, meditating on
[1:20:12] scripture. Abraham Lincoln, that was one
[1:20:14] of the only books he read growing up.
[1:20:16] And one of them heeded to only the
[1:20:18] wicked things that came into his life.
[1:20:20] They were both fed the same thing. So
[1:20:22] you can't say hard times are an excuse
[1:20:24] cuz they were both thrown horrendous
[1:20:27] things in their life, but produced one
[1:20:30] fruit in season and one fruit in a
[1:20:32] different season. And the la the next
[1:20:36] verse, the ungodly are not so, but are
[1:20:39] like the chaff which the wind driveth
[1:20:41] away. They're not planted like that
[1:20:44] tree.
[1:20:45] Just the next thing. Oh, they're walking
[1:20:47] in the counsel of the ungodly. Then
[1:20:49] they're standing in the way of the
[1:20:50] sinner. Then they're sitting in the seat
[1:20:51] of the scornful. They're never
[1:20:53] grounded. There's no solidarity. There's
[1:20:56] no there's no future. There's no fruit
[1:20:58] in the season to come. And they won't
[1:21:01] stand. The next
[1:21:05] verse, the ungodly shall not stand in
[1:21:08] the jud in in in the judgment, nor
[1:21:10] sinners in the congregation of the
[1:21:12] righteous. And the next
[1:21:14] verse, for the Lord knoweth the way of
[1:21:17] the righteous. Of course, he knows it
[1:21:19] because it's his way. He's the one who
[1:21:23] gave them those things to meditate on.
[1:21:25] That's what they've been feeding on
[1:21:27] their whole life. And the Lord will say,
[1:21:29] "I know that way.
[1:21:31] That's the way I have chosen for
[1:21:34] you. And so the
[1:21:36] Lord opened this psalm to me. Delighting
[1:21:40] in his law is a choice. Hearing from him
[1:21:43] is a
[1:21:44] choice. And in the
[1:21:47] end, the Lord will know it because it's
[1:21:49] his way. And isn't it wonderful the
[1:21:53] imagery? A tree like the by the water.
[1:21:56] Isn't that a wonderful thing?
[1:21:58] Praise God. I hope that made some sense.
[1:22:08] Both those brothers said, "Well, I can't
[1:22:11] preach. I can't do it." Yes, you can.
[1:22:14] And you did a very, very good job.
[1:22:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:21] What Brother Josiah didn't say was that
[1:22:25] uh the Lord gave him this these things
[1:22:27] in the middle of the night.
[1:22:29] He got up in the spirit and just started
[1:22:33] writing as fast as he could go. I guess
[1:22:35] typing probably, but just recording and
[1:22:38] recording what the how the Lord was
[1:22:39] dealing with them. Okay. Testimony
[1:22:42] first. Yes.
[1:22:47] Right now. Okay. Good. Well, we have
[1:22:50] we'll start.
[1:22:54] I'm getting to the age where I'll forget
[1:22:56] in a minute. Why don't you why don't you
[1:22:58] go out here so so the camera
[1:23:02] so as brother Josiah and brother Paul
[1:23:05] gave their testimony I know I get the
[1:23:07] opportunity but you know if you ask of
[1:23:10] the Lord he will answer
[1:23:12] he doesn't say only the perfect and only
[1:23:14] the good ones he said call upon the name
[1:23:17] of the
[1:23:18] Lord I was when my girls were growing up
[1:23:22] I um I was driving down the road and I
[1:23:24] said I wonder if the girls are all cut
[1:23:26] up in their insurance cuz I said, "You
[1:23:28] can have a car when you can afford the
[1:23:30] insurance." So, I called the insurance
[1:23:33] agent and I asked him, I said, "Are my
[1:23:36] girls all paid up in their insurance?"
[1:23:37] And these were his words. He said,
[1:23:40] "Aaron, if all the kids were like your
[1:23:43] kids, we wouldn't have the problems we
[1:23:45] have today. They pay their insurance and
[1:23:48] if they're going to be a day late, they
[1:23:50] let me know."
[1:23:53] Well, that I mean dad got happy and kind
[1:23:56] of like thank you
[1:23:58] Lord. But as soon as that happened I
[1:24:01] said now
[1:24:02] Lord where where are they between how is
[1:24:05] it between them and
[1:24:07] you what kind of
[1:24:10] assurance is there? And the Lord said
[1:24:14] like Job who laid a sacrifice every
[1:24:17] morning in case his children had sinned
[1:24:21] and they were married children. I was
[1:24:24] just reading through it right now. If
[1:24:25] you take and read the first few verses
[1:24:27] of chapter one in Job. He laid a
[1:24:29] sacrifice every morning in case his
[1:24:33] children had sinned. It made the ride to
[1:24:36] work a blessed ride.
[1:24:39] So, I I was doing some studying
[1:24:43] and God will confirm it. He'll make it
[1:24:45] so you can't miss it. And I was doing
[1:24:49] some uh studying the message for some
[1:24:52] thoughts I was having. And I'll find
[1:24:54] something that maybe Brother Bam said
[1:24:56] I'm looking for. And that's the quote.
[1:24:58] But I'll read three or four lines up and
[1:25:00] three or four just to get the filling of
[1:25:02] the hole.
[1:25:03] And brother Bam says like any good
[1:25:07] father like Job, he would lay a
[1:25:10] sacrifice every morning for his
[1:25:12] children. Amen. And each one of you are
[1:25:15] a children child of God. Yeah. And he
[1:25:18] loves you.
[1:25:24] That sacrifice that we can lay before
[1:25:26] the Lord every morning for our
[1:25:29] children, it should be our prayers.
[1:25:33] lay those before the Lord. And believe
[1:25:36] me, that's time well spent. Someone
[1:25:44] else. God bless you, brothers and
[1:25:46] sisters. Um, this is actually I'm
[1:25:49] nervous. Um Um I never uh had a
[1:25:54] testimony. um never well I have a
[1:25:57] testimony but I just want to say and uh
[1:26:01] I'm just grateful for Pastor Daniel
[1:26:04] here, brother Manny, brother Johnny,
[1:26:06] brother Aaron, and all the deacons and
[1:26:08] and and just everyone here in the
[1:26:11] congregation, my aunt Janie, Eva, you
[1:26:14] know, they've been a really uh my aunt
[1:26:16] Christy and uh Lo, on and on. I can just
[1:26:20] go I mean uh a huge family that I have
[1:26:23] and and all of you.
[1:26:26] Um I love the Lord. That's first and
[1:26:29] foremost. I love the Lord with all of my
[1:26:31] heart and soul. Um I wouldn't if it's a
[1:26:35] choice, you know, it's a it's a it's a
[1:26:38] choice like brother Josiah spoke to us.
[1:26:40] You know, it's a decision for us to come
[1:26:42] to him and and we have for free more
[1:26:44] agency to either do right or wrong in
[1:26:48] our lives. And that's a choice. You
[1:26:50] know, I speak of a message how brother
[1:26:53] Brandham spoke of the world spinning and
[1:26:55] and the world spinning in blood and he
[1:26:57] was goes into the bar and he sees a a
[1:27:00] lady, you know, just deep in sin and she
[1:27:03] was just drinking. And many of you may
[1:27:05] know that story and um that's one thing
[1:27:08] that I remember is just the world
[1:27:09] spinning in blood. How Jesus just covers
[1:27:11] the whole earth and he's always there
[1:27:13] for us. He never takes his blood away
[1:27:15] from us. Um, we're saved. You know, he
[1:27:18] he died on the cross for all of our
[1:27:22] sins. Um, I I have a uh I want to make
[1:27:26] this quick. You know, um I spent 15
[1:27:29] years in prison um for armed robbery. Um
[1:27:34] was raised reared in the word all of my
[1:27:36] life. You know, I was dedicated here as
[1:27:39] a as a child right here in the front. Um
[1:27:42] when brother Green was here. Um, I never
[1:27:45] been, uh, you know, I came searching for
[1:27:48] the Lord. You know, I came with open
[1:27:50] arms. I came here to the altar. Brother,
[1:27:53] uh, Pastor Daniel was here. You know, I
[1:27:55] didn't I didn't really know anyone. I
[1:27:56] just knew that this was a place of
[1:27:58] refuge uh, for me. Um, and the Lord just
[1:28:03] really touched my heart. You know, I cry
[1:28:05] out. I have a lot of of uh, pain. You
[1:28:08] know, I've I've been through a lot. We
[1:28:10] all have um been through our own our own
[1:28:13] um trials and tribulations in life and
[1:28:18] we can't judge one another. We can't say
[1:28:21] oh you know you did that, you did that.
[1:28:23] Oh, you you're you're a worse sinner.
[1:28:25] You're you're this. You know, um God's
[1:28:28] mercy and grace and love has covered us
[1:28:32] all and he saved us. Um and we've got to
[1:28:36] cry out to him though. There's a there's
[1:28:37] a choice. Um through my time, you know,
[1:28:41] I I always thought of, you know, being
[1:28:44] read in church that it was either um oh,
[1:28:47] my mom, my dad, you know, and this and
[1:28:49] that, you know, it my brother passed
[1:28:52] away from fentanyl um overdose, you
[1:28:54] know, my father passed away um from
[1:28:57] dementia while I was in prison. Um and
[1:29:00] it was really hard on me, you know.
[1:29:03] Um I can't begin to tell you the things
[1:29:06] are expressed to you what I've been
[1:29:08] through things I cannot even say um here
[1:29:12] uh you know just by the children being
[1:29:14] here and things like that. Pastor Daniel
[1:29:16] knows more um more in depth of what I've
[1:29:20] been through.
[1:29:22] Um 15 years in prison, you know, I was
[1:29:26] always reading the word. I never I I
[1:29:28] backslid, you know. I was I was in a
[1:29:31] backsliding condition. And it was a
[1:29:32] place of where you are in a place of
[1:29:36] war. You know, it's kind of like a war.
[1:29:38] You you don't you don't have a choice.
[1:29:40] You're in a place of demonic powers. I
[1:29:43] mean, you see it left and right in in
[1:29:46] that in a prison state. And I have to be
[1:29:49] open. It's hard for me, but also this is
[1:29:51] I have to be honest here, you know,
[1:29:54] uh seeing um just everything that
[1:29:57] everyone's been through. Brother Manny,
[1:29:59] you know, I I I w I was I always I
[1:30:01] stream, you know, and I stream and I'm I
[1:30:03] go back, you know, try to catch up on
[1:30:05] all the brothers and sisters, what
[1:30:06] they've been through. Um, and brother
[1:30:09] Manny's testimony, brother Johnny's
[1:30:11] testimony. It was something that just
[1:30:13] was shocking to me. I just couldn't. I
[1:30:15] was like, well, if these brothers can
[1:30:17] get on the microphone and speak these
[1:30:19] things, you know, I feel I can.
[1:30:22] Um, I I just know
[1:30:25] that religion and and a mom's religion
[1:30:29] or a father's religion, it's not going
[1:30:31] to save me. That that's not going to
[1:30:34] save me one bit. I've been it at 17
[1:30:36] years old. I just left and I was like,
[1:30:38] I'm
[1:30:40] gone. But afterwards, you know, I wasn't
[1:30:43] baptized. You know, at that point, I
[1:30:45] wasn't baptized. I just was like, I'm
[1:30:47] done with this.
[1:30:48] I
[1:30:49] left when I was at 20 years old, you
[1:30:52] know, I went and did armed robbery. Was
[1:30:54] sentenced to 17 and a half years in
[1:30:57] prison. Did 15 years. Barely been out
[1:30:59] maybe about a year and a half. So, this
[1:31:02] is hard. This is a very serious thing.
[1:31:04] But I love the Lord. I always would hear
[1:31:06] hear the word. I would open up Brother
[1:31:08] Brandham's messages day in day out
[1:31:10] reading the reading the word, crying
[1:31:13] out. I cry a lot because there's just I
[1:31:16] love the Lord. My tears are for for God.
[1:31:19] I just I just I love him so much. And
[1:31:22] I'm here and I come here on my own
[1:31:25] accord, you know. Um I just I see
[1:31:29] brother Lyall, you know, how he how he
[1:31:31] speaks. It's beautiful, you know, how he
[1:31:34] in said has different voices, you know,
[1:31:37] he has and you know, it's encouraging
[1:31:39] and and he's he's just really he's he's
[1:31:43] a brother filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:31:46] and I really and I really love that. You
[1:31:48] know, we all love the Lord. You know,
[1:31:52] we're here because of the Lord because
[1:31:54] he died for us. We're making a stand
[1:31:56] like saying we're rejecting the world.
[1:31:59] We don't want nothing of the world. We
[1:32:00] don't want the sin, but we also live in
[1:32:03] a place where there's sin. It's
[1:32:05] constantly around. Satan is an adversary
[1:32:08] and he's always trying to get us. No
[1:32:10] matter what we do, what we say, he's
[1:32:12] trying to always He's a, like I always
[1:32:14] say, he's a roaring lion, but he's a
[1:32:16] lion with no teeth. He's a bee with no
[1:32:19] sting. You know, he just buzzes and and
[1:32:22] you know, um, Brother Brandham says in a
[1:32:24] message, he's he's just thunder, you
[1:32:27] know, and I'm not sure the exact
[1:32:28] message, but he does say it. He says
[1:32:30] he's just all thunder, but God is
[1:32:33] lightning, you know. He just he just he
[1:32:36] that's all he is just a big threat.
[1:32:39] Um, I just want to say um I want to say
[1:32:42] one thing that our pastor was um
[1:32:45] speaking on
[1:32:47] and one one second in Colossians
[1:32:55] um one
[1:32:59] second in Colossians
[1:33:02] uh u scripture that uh really came to
[1:33:06] mind says
[1:33:08] We're all strengthened with his with
[1:33:10] with all might according to his glorious
[1:33:13] power unto all patience because I we
[1:33:17] need patience sometimes. I need
[1:33:19] patience. I am I am sometimes I lack
[1:33:21] that you know
[1:33:23] um and longsuffering with joyfulness.
[1:33:27] Longsuffering means you know we need to
[1:33:30] be there. It's it's a
[1:33:33] longsuffering you know with joyfulness.
[1:33:35] Don't you got to do it with joy. Giving
[1:33:37] thanks unto the father in in in
[1:33:39] Colossians chapter 1 verse uh 11
[1:33:43] through4 giving thanks unto the father
[1:33:46] which has made us meat to be partakers
[1:33:48] of the inheritance. We're we we have an
[1:33:50] inheritance. We have a crown um of the
[1:33:54] saints of light who has delivered us
[1:33:56] from the power of darkness and has
[1:33:58] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:34:01] dear son in whom we have
[1:34:03] redemption through his blood even the
[1:34:07] forgiveness of sins.
[1:34:10] So I I look back and I and I talked to
[1:34:13] our pastor many times. I I call him, you
[1:34:16] know, sometimes daily just I I'm I'm not
[1:34:20] I'm not a perfect Christian, you know, I
[1:34:23] have I have my problems. Believe me, I
[1:34:26] have my problems. But when you are in a
[1:34:28] in a state of prison for that long, you
[1:34:31] better seek wisdom and counsel from your
[1:34:35] pastor. You know, the word teaches us
[1:34:37] that you see seek wisdom from your
[1:34:39] pastor, from my my elder brother Aaron.
[1:34:42] I speak to him. I'm crying. Uh, believe
[1:34:46] me, I I I'm sometimes just I feel just
[1:34:49] dirty and just shame and and uh I just I
[1:34:55] know that in this
[1:34:57] congregation that I see the Holy Spirit
[1:35:00] indwelling in the in the brothers and
[1:35:03] sisters here. It's evident, you know,
[1:35:05] it's very evident here. Um this morning
[1:35:08] I got up, I didn't sleep well, you know.
[1:35:12] Um I was I was kind of uh just low. My
[1:35:15] spirit was low and I came and just the
[1:35:17] service and the preaching and
[1:35:19] everything. I seen a sister here
[1:35:21] standing up raising her. I don't know
[1:35:23] your name sister but you know it's
[1:35:25] respect to the elders and it's to those
[1:35:27] that are have been in and just it where
[1:35:31] two or three are gathered he's here. I
[1:35:34] hear the music. Um I cry man. I I but
[1:35:38] all of my tears are for the Lord. You
[1:35:40] know, I I have so much to say. I didn't
[1:35:42] plan nothing to speak, but my Psalms I'm
[1:35:44] going to read a Psalms to you that's
[1:35:46] always been my Psalms. When I've been in
[1:35:48] prison in darkness and and um and in
[1:35:52] these situations, I I
[1:35:54] just this is the Psalms I just want to
[1:35:57] share with you. I I have so much to say,
[1:35:59] but
[1:36:03] um one second.
[1:36:09] Psalms 51 has always been my Psalms, you
[1:36:12] know. Um I know the word. I know the
[1:36:15] Lord. I I know I I've I just know but
[1:36:19] but the thing is not it's it's it's
[1:36:21] doing um have Psalms 51. I'm just going
[1:36:26] to say this. I don't I'm I'm nervous. I
[1:36:28] didn't plan to really speak um speak
[1:36:30] much, but I just want to share this with
[1:36:33] the congregation. I hope that this
[1:36:35] touches your heart to us. I I don't
[1:36:38] know. Um, but let the Lord just uh lead
[1:36:40] us. Have mercy upon me, oh God,
[1:36:43] according to thy loving kindness,
[1:36:45] according unto the multitude of thy
[1:36:46] tender mercies. Blot out my
[1:36:50] transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from
[1:36:52] mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
[1:36:54] sin. For I acknowledge my transgression,
[1:36:57] and my sin is ever before me. Against
[1:37:00] thee, thee only have I sinned, and have
[1:37:02] done this evil in thy sight, that thou
[1:37:03] mayest be justified when thou speakest,
[1:37:06] and be clear when thou judgest. Behold,
[1:37:09] I was shapen in iniquity, and sin did my
[1:37:11] mother conceive me. Behold, thou
[1:37:13] desireest truth in the inward parts, and
[1:37:15] in the hidden part, thou shalt make me
[1:37:17] to know wisdom. Purge me with high soap,
[1:37:20] that I shall be clean. Wash me, and I
[1:37:22] shall be whiter than snow. Make me to
[1:37:25] hear joy and gladness that the boss that
[1:37:27] has broken may rejoice. Hide thy face
[1:37:30] from my sins, and blot out all mine
[1:37:32] iniquities. Create in me a clean
[1:37:37] heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit
[1:37:40] within me. Cast me not away from thy
[1:37:42] presence, and take not thy holy spirit
[1:37:45] from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:37:48] salvation, and uphold me with thy free
[1:37:50] spirit. Then will I teach transgressor
[1:37:52] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[1:37:55] be converted unto thee. Deliver me from
[1:37:58] bl guiltness. Oh God, thou God of my
[1:38:01] salvation, and my tongue shall single
[1:38:02] out of thy righteousness, oh Lord, open
[1:38:05] thou my lips, and my mouth shall show
[1:38:08] forth thy praise. For thou desireest not
[1:38:11] sacrifice, else I will give it. Thou
[1:38:14] delightest not in burnt offerings. The
[1:38:16] sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a
[1:38:20] broken and contrite heart. Oh God, thou
[1:38:23] will not despise. Do good in thy good
[1:38:25] pleasure unto Zion. Build thou the walls
[1:38:27] of Jerusalem. Then shalt thou be passed
[1:38:30] pleased with the sacrifices of
[1:38:33] righteousness with burnt offerings and
[1:38:34] whole burnt offerings that thou and
[1:38:36] shall thy and shall they offer bullocks
[1:38:39] upon thine altar.
[1:38:41] I just want to I just want to say thank
[1:38:43] you to everybody for having me and um
[1:38:47] and uh just pray for me. I just really
[1:38:51] really pray for me and and and
[1:38:54] um that's the strongest thing is is
[1:38:56] prayer. Um I just want to thank you. God
[1:39:00] bless you all.
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:08] We see how important a church is,
[1:39:10] friends. And one day, Brother Jonathan
[1:39:13] might share his testimony with us and
[1:39:16] what he's been through. And he's been
[1:39:17] through a lot, this young man. But God
[1:39:20] bless God blessed us by bringing him to
[1:39:23] us.
[1:39:25] [Applause]
[1:39:33] Um, I just wanted to to thank the Lord.
[1:39:37] Um, so about a week ago,
[1:39:41] uh, just a quick testimony.
[1:39:43] Um, my stomach, uh, I've been having a
[1:39:47] lot of problems with it over the last
[1:39:48] couple years. Uh, and, um, it started
[1:39:52] like three years ago. So, I I was
[1:39:54] working up on the roof and I had a
[1:39:57] really sharp pain uh in my stomach,
[1:39:59] worse than I've ever had. Um and I got
[1:40:02] so sick and I I just I was actually
[1:40:04] bedridden for a couple days and and it
[1:40:07] took months and months to get better. Um
[1:40:11] and for a while I'd been good. It come
[1:40:13] back and it go
[1:40:14] away. Uh but two weeks ago uh I think I
[1:40:18] don't know if it's just a lot of stress
[1:40:20] uh my job um a lot of things piled up
[1:40:24] and I actually I got two letters from
[1:40:26] the Arizona Department of Revenue and
[1:40:30] that uh that pushed me I think that just
[1:40:32] that was the thing that broke that was
[1:40:33] the straw that broke the camel's back.
[1:40:35] Uh, and I I saw those letters. They
[1:40:38] actually they didn't turn out to be
[1:40:39] anything bad. They underpaid me and they
[1:40:41] wanted to give me more money. But I just
[1:40:42] saw them and I was like, "Ah, this is
[1:40:45] all I need now." And and I was driving.
[1:40:48] Normally I'll have a medicine or, you
[1:40:49] know, something that I can grab. But I
[1:40:52] was driving and my stomach just started,
[1:40:54] you know,
[1:40:55] gnawing. And the pain is so bad it like
[1:40:58] wraps around on my back. And I was just,
[1:41:01] it was a miserable drive. And I couldn't
[1:41:03] do anything. And I stopped by the Circle
[1:41:04] K. They didn't have medicine. I don't.
[1:41:07] So, I got home and I finally took the
[1:41:10] medicine that I take and um kind of
[1:41:12] calmed down, but the the pain kind of
[1:41:15] lingered and I was just worried cuz if I
[1:41:18] don't catch it in time, I don't know if
[1:41:19] it does damage or what. Um, so I I put
[1:41:23] in a prayer request and
[1:41:25] um, honestly
[1:41:28] uh, honestly the next day it felt better
[1:41:30] and it it felt pretty much healed. Uh, I
[1:41:35] know that the brothers here in church
[1:41:36] were asking me, are you better? Are you
[1:41:37] better? I was like, well, I think I'm
[1:41:38] mostly better.
[1:41:40] it it was better
[1:41:43] and uh you know I stopped taking the
[1:41:45] medicine and I was able to eat whatever
[1:41:47] I want uh yesterday and today and I'm
[1:41:50] fine. So just wanted to thank the
[1:41:56] Lord. Believe it was Habacook that said
[1:41:58] the just shall live by faith. We put our
[1:42:01] faith in these prayers and and turn it
[1:42:04] over to the Lord and he always answers.
[1:42:07] Did I miss one?
[1:42:12] We'll let your wife go first. Did you
[1:42:13] want to go?
[1:42:16] I just want to say um thank you for the
[1:42:18] church for praying for the fire at my
[1:42:20] parents' farm about a month ago. They
[1:42:23] were at church service at Easter Service
[1:42:25] meetings and a fire broke out. Um a
[1:42:27] wildfire broke out about a just a couple
[1:42:30] or a mile away from the house and my
[1:42:33] parents have a large ranch that I grew
[1:42:35] up on. And when they were coming home
[1:42:38] that night, um the road was all closed
[1:42:40] off and they didn't even know any
[1:42:42] information, but it was a neighbor that
[1:42:44] called them and said, "Hey, there's a
[1:42:46] fire. Where are you guys?" And they were
[1:42:47] like, "We're at church." But when they
[1:42:49] got home, they got through the police um
[1:42:52] barricade and they got home and the
[1:42:54] police said, "You know, your farm was
[1:42:56] one of the lucky ones that weren't even
[1:42:58] touched." And he said, "It was really
[1:43:01] interesting." He said an hour ago, and
[1:43:03] it was right around the time when we um
[1:43:06] asked for a prayer, but he said about an
[1:43:08] hour ago, the wind changed and that fire
[1:43:11] moved into the um Elk Island Park
[1:43:14] National Park and it started burning
[1:43:16] there. And so anyway, the fire is out
[1:43:18] and I just want to say thank you for all
[1:43:20] your prayers. They appreciated it.
[1:43:28] Just want to read one scripture in 1
[1:43:30] Timothy
[1:43:32] 66. But godliness with contentment is
[1:43:35] great
[1:43:36] gain. And I was thinking about an
[1:43:40] anchor. And I'm so glad the anchor on a
[1:43:44] ship is tied to the ship. So when you
[1:43:48] drop your burden in that sea, you can
[1:43:51] leave it there. Amen. And then you can
[1:43:54] say hello
[1:43:55] on. So just a little encouragement.
[1:43:59] Amen.
[1:44:01] Praise God.
[1:44:07] This actually is one of my sister's
[1:44:09] testimony, but I asked her if I could
[1:44:10] share it.
[1:44:12] Um, so Friday night we had a family
[1:44:14] night and um after the family night my
[1:44:17] sister left and her car stopped working
[1:44:19] at the light down the road and uh so I
[1:44:23] had left and we live in the same
[1:44:25] direction. So I passed her and asked if
[1:44:27] she wanted me to stay and she's like no
[1:44:29] I'll be here a while. So I went to drive
[1:44:31] away and then I just felt to stay. So I
[1:44:34] kind of parked off to the side and just
[1:44:36] waited. Well, she ended up needing a tow
[1:44:39] truck, so she was going to leave her
[1:44:42] keys there and I could take her home.
[1:44:44] So, we started driving and she was
[1:44:46] sharing some things on her heart with
[1:44:48] me. And she had been struggling with
[1:44:50] some depression and just feeling um
[1:44:53] alone, just alone and maybe unseen.
[1:44:59] And she said, I think she said a little
[1:45:02] abandoned. And she said, 'But I always
[1:45:04] try to just remember and count the
[1:45:06] blessings, count the good things that
[1:45:07] the Lord has done for me and keep going.
[1:45:10] So we got to her apartment and she's
[1:45:12] like, "Oh man, I left my house key at
[1:45:14] the car, so we were going to have to go
[1:45:16] back." So we called the tow truck guy
[1:45:18] and he's like, "Don't worry, I'm going
[1:45:20] to have the car there before you know
[1:45:21] it. Don't worry about it." So we went
[1:45:23] back and I dropped her off and went
[1:45:26] home. About half an hour later, I got a
[1:45:29] call from her and she's like, "You won't
[1:45:30] believe what just happened. And it was
[1:45:31] the craziest thing. She's like, "He got
[1:45:33] my car, I think, off of the truck, but
[1:45:36] he could not get it to go in the parking
[1:45:38] spot cuz it just would not start, would
[1:45:39] not hold a charge." And he told her, "I
[1:45:41] cannot get the car to move." So, she
[1:45:44] closed her eyes and she prayed, or I
[1:45:45] don't know if she closed her eyes or
[1:45:46] not, but she prayed. And um she asked
[1:45:49] the Lord to do what needed to be done to
[1:45:52] get that car into its spot. So, she said
[1:45:55] as soon as she prayed, the car just came
[1:45:57] to life and just pulled right into that
[1:45:59] spot.
[1:46:00] So the guy said something along the
[1:46:03] lines of, "Did you see that? That was so
[1:46:04] crazy." And she said, "Well, it's just
[1:46:07] because I prayed." And um he said, "You
[1:46:10] did?" And she said, "Yes." And he said,
[1:46:12] "Well, will you pray that I can get back
[1:46:14] together with my
[1:46:15] ex?" And she was like, "Well, is that
[1:46:19] what you want? Is that what you need?"
[1:46:21] And he said, "No, but I feel so lonely.
[1:46:24] I feel so and she said he said I feel
[1:46:28] abandoned and unseen and along those
[1:46:32] lines and she said you would not believe
[1:46:34] the situation or the conversation I just
[1:46:36] had with my sister like right before we
[1:46:39] got here she said do you want me to pray
[1:46:42] with you and he said yes I would so she
[1:46:44] prayed for him right there at the
[1:46:46] parking lot asked the Lord to guide him
[1:46:49] to show him to let him realize that he
[1:46:53] is loved by his family and by God. And
[1:46:56] we were thinking how the Lord's timing
[1:46:58] is so great because, you know, if I
[1:47:00] hadn't stayed or she needed a ride or
[1:47:01] somebody else gave a ride, whatever, all
[1:47:03] the things wouldn't have fallen into
[1:47:04] place for her to be able to testify to
[1:47:06] this man. Um, and his name is Mark. If
[1:47:09] you remember him in prayer, maybe
[1:47:11] something that I believe something that
[1:47:13] she said will trigger in his heart where
[1:47:15] he can't ever deny that God is alive.
[1:47:19] Amen.
[1:47:23] Amen.
[1:47:31] The other day we were going to Prescott
[1:47:33] for my cousin's wedding and we were
[1:47:35] pulling the trailer for the sound system
[1:47:37] for the wedding and we were coming up
[1:47:39] the steep kind of highway there coming
[1:47:41] in out of Anthem or coming into Anthem
[1:47:43] there heading up through Ballot Canyon
[1:47:46] and uh Lydia just got my attention said,
[1:47:49] "Hey dad, someone's trying to I think I
[1:47:51] was listening to something on my
[1:47:53] earphones and she's somebody's trying to
[1:47:55] get your attention." And I look over and
[1:47:56] there's a guy in a car waving,
[1:47:58] passenger, and uh I rolled down the
[1:48:01] window and he says, "Your trailer hitch
[1:48:03] is about ready to come off." And uh so
[1:48:06] pulled over and the these big nuts,
[1:48:09] they're real big. I think an inch and
[1:48:11] 7/8 was almost fallen off completely
[1:48:13] where the hitch would have come off. And
[1:48:15] I mean, we have chains and everything,
[1:48:17] but you know, you could flip a vehicle,
[1:48:20] trailer could come off, kill somebody.
[1:48:22] It been real serious. And we were just
[1:48:24] moments away from that happening. And
[1:48:26] just for somebody to even look over and
[1:48:28] notice that it was loose and about ready
[1:48:30] to drop off, I've never had a a ball
[1:48:33] like that with the nut loose in the
[1:48:36] first place. And so it was just the
[1:48:38] Lord. I was able to tighten it by hand
[1:48:39] and get to the next exit and go to a
[1:48:42] auto parts store and get a correct
[1:48:44] wrench to really tighten it down. But
[1:48:45] the Lord was really mindful of us. It
[1:48:47] could have been a lot more serious. I
[1:48:50] just thank the Lord.
[1:48:55] Like like brother Jordan said, who even
[1:48:57] looks over at a a ball and a hitch going
[1:49:01] down the
[1:49:02] highway? I think the angels were
[1:49:05] encamped about the one that the little
[1:49:08] family that loved him. Somebody else.
[1:49:18] All right. I just want to say I uh I've
[1:49:21] been
[1:49:22] noticing something about uh church. It's
[1:49:26] been a lot different for me. I used to
[1:49:28] go to
[1:49:32] Sorry. Sorry
[1:49:34] everybody, but I I used to go to um
[1:49:38] North Side Fellowship years ago. Loved
[1:49:41] it. Uh uh I used to work for Brother
[1:49:45] Green uh putting hardwood floors
[1:49:47] together for him and uh uh I remember
[1:49:51] one day I I got a little Volvo and uh I
[1:49:57] was kind of telling the Lord on the way
[1:49:58] to church. I was on my way
[1:50:01] here. Uh I said uh you know Lord I could
[1:50:05] go to North Side or I could go to the
[1:50:09] one of the other churches. where do you
[1:50:11] want me to go? And North Side just kind
[1:50:13] of popped in my head and I was thinking
[1:50:16] to myself, you know, I was on my way
[1:50:18] here. I thought, you know, if he did
[1:50:20] want me to go to North Side, he'd
[1:50:23] probably throw a vehicle right in front
[1:50:25] of me and I would h I would have to I
[1:50:28] slammed on my brakes because he did. And
[1:50:31] so that's where I went. But uh I've
[1:50:35] really started to notice something
[1:50:37] around here which is I just think is
[1:50:39] wonderful and that is uh with brother's
[1:50:42] testimony earlier and and some of the
[1:50:45] things I've heard how much the Holy
[1:50:47] Spirit is starting to try and move
[1:50:50] us to a
[1:50:52] full relationship
[1:50:55] with uh with Jesus.
[1:50:58] That's what I want.
[1:51:00] I don't care about houses. I don't care
[1:51:03] about property. I don't care about uh
[1:51:07] any of the things I used to really
[1:51:09] really care about. I don't want nothing
[1:51:12] to do with them no
[1:51:14] more. You guys, we're getting ready to
[1:51:16] go home. Amen. And that
[1:51:20] door is starting to close, you know, and
[1:51:24] and we need to be really really present
[1:51:27] about that and really really con uh
[1:51:30] considering those things. Um
[1:51:33] uh we really need to put our
[1:51:37] faith in God and like the brothers are
[1:51:40] saying it's it's not a perfection
[1:51:44] contest. This is uh this is the thing
[1:51:47] that that the Lord
[1:51:49] knew, you know, we probably a lot of us
[1:51:53] we're going to mess up sometimes,
[1:51:55] but he made a way for us to get there.
[1:52:00] And I I I'm seeing that way just by the
[1:52:03] different testimonies, just little
[1:52:04] things I've heard. You know, it it
[1:52:07] sounds little, but I think it's really
[1:52:10] big. And and we're starting to be pushed
[1:52:14] that way. I could see it in different
[1:52:16] people's hearts, different people's
[1:52:19] perspectives. Uh and
[1:52:23] um that it's it's important to me. It's
[1:52:26] really important to me because I don't
[1:52:28] know if I had that before.
[1:52:30] Uh, I've argued with a lot of people
[1:52:33] over
[1:52:34] doctrine. I don't know why. It's
[1:52:37] incredibly stupid when you could just be
[1:52:40] testifying of something that Jesus did.
[1:52:43] Amen. You know, a lot of people want to
[1:52:45] argue about doctrine. I don't want to
[1:52:47] argue about doctrine. I'm not trying to
[1:52:48] take anybody's convictions away from
[1:52:50] them. I'm not trying to tell anybody how
[1:52:52] to believe it. But just for
[1:52:55] me, I want a relationship. Amen. With
[1:53:00] God.
[1:53:01] I mean, a real true relationship with
[1:53:06] God. Think about that. How many people
[1:53:09] out there have that for real?
[1:53:12] you know, I I you know, you see a lot of
[1:53:15] stuff uh especially on on Christian
[1:53:17] sites and stuff and it it seems like
[1:53:20] more people are interested in doing
[1:53:23] something affiliated with
[1:53:26] Christianity, but you have to wonder,
[1:53:30] are they do they really have that
[1:53:31] relationship? Do they are they really
[1:53:34] that close with the Lord?
[1:53:36] you know, and uh I mean, not judging
[1:53:38] them or anything,
[1:53:40] but but that's what I want because like
[1:53:44] I said, the doors starting to close and
[1:53:47] we want to
[1:53:49] be right. We want to be We want our
[1:53:53] lives to be good. Sometimes, you know,
[1:53:56] you go through divorce, you go through
[1:53:58] baloney, sometimes you go to prison, you
[1:54:02] know, but praise God because we're here
[1:54:04] now.
[1:54:06] And uh I just uh I just wanted to really
[1:54:11] uh thank brother Dan
[1:54:14] uh for coming out here, you know, and
[1:54:17] and uh having this little place for us
[1:54:20] and and us
[1:54:22] knowing that this is some place that we
[1:54:25] can come and we can hear the gospel and
[1:54:30] we can rejoice in it and uh we can make
[1:54:34] our hearts what's right with
[1:54:36] God. Um, and
[1:54:40] uh, uh, I wanted to tell you uh earlier
[1:54:44] to pray for
[1:54:46] my girlfriend's knee because she's she's
[1:54:50] had knee surgery. So, you
[1:54:52] guys be present about
[1:54:55] that. Let that let that sit with you
[1:54:59] because I don't want it just for me. I
[1:55:02] want it for my family.
[1:55:04] And I don't know how you guys feel, but
[1:55:07] I feel like your family.
[1:55:10] So,
[1:55:11] [Applause]
[1:55:21] like in 2009, I lost my first wife to
[1:55:24] cancer and um I started drinking heavily
[1:55:27] and they put me on probation. I was
[1:55:30] fighting this case and I had to go stay
[1:55:32] with my grandma on the south side and I
[1:55:34] was I couldn't be in the west side. They
[1:55:36] didn't want me there. So I went to go
[1:55:37] stay with my grandma and I was drinking
[1:55:39] heavily and she got mad at me because I
[1:55:41] said I'm going to go back to the store.
[1:55:42] She
[1:55:44] goes again. I go, "Yeah." So I give her
[1:55:47] my wallet. So I go to the food city. I'm
[1:55:49] walking back and I see this man just
[1:55:51] come out of nowhere. I said, "He's going
[1:55:53] to hit me up for some money. I got
[1:55:54] nothing for him." So he says, "Excuse
[1:55:56] me, s I got nothing for you." So I kept
[1:55:58] on walking. And I felt bad. I said, "I'm
[1:56:00] lying." I said, "I got 10 bucks." He
[1:56:02] hugs me and he towels me straight up.
[1:56:05] Getting drunk and drugging ain't going
[1:56:06] to bring her back. Whoa. And I said,
[1:56:08] "Excuse me?" And he was gone. And I had
[1:56:11] and I had this smell of roses all on me.
[1:56:13] And and I went home. I still get the
[1:56:15] goosebumps. And I went to my grandma and
[1:56:17] I told her this what happened. She goes,
[1:56:18] "You I think he probably entertained an
[1:56:20] angel or something." But but how does he
[1:56:23] know that I was mourning for my dead
[1:56:24] wife? Yeah. But that's what he said.
[1:56:27] getting drunk and druggy ain't going to
[1:56:28] bring her back. And when I turned
[1:56:30] around, excuse me, he was gone.
[1:56:34] That's a real story.
[1:56:40] Whoa.
[1:56:43] This guy was
[1:56:45] dirty. When he hugged me, he smelled
[1:56:47] like roses. Wow.
[1:56:50] He was tore up from the floor. He was
[1:56:53] dirty. All of nasty looking.
[1:56:58] Wow. Reminds me of that story of of
[1:57:00] Martin and how he cut his coat in half
[1:57:04] to to give to that beggar on the street
[1:57:09] and then later on that beggar comes to
[1:57:10] him with that half of a coat over him
[1:57:14] and it was the Lord Jesus. Wow, man.
[1:57:17] Amazing. Couple more. Okay.
[1:57:28] Um, sorry that's really
[1:57:31] loud. As a few months ago, I told Paul
[1:57:33] that we should probably figure out what
[1:57:35] to do with our work car because we put
[1:57:37] about 150,000 miles on it. It's a Camry,
[1:57:40] so it can go two to 300,000, but I was
[1:57:43] getting worried. So, I told him we
[1:57:45] should keep praying about it. And on
[1:57:48] Mother's Day, Paul said, um, "Don't let
[1:57:52] Malachi borrow our car." But I talked
[1:57:54] him into
[1:57:55] it. He totaled our last, the last time
[1:57:59] we let him drive a car was seven years
[1:58:01] ago, and he totaled it. And I was like,
[1:58:02] "It's been seven years, second chance."
[1:58:05] So, we let him drive the car on Mother's
[1:58:08] Day. And he called me and said, "Mom, I
[1:58:10] was in an accident." And I laughed at
[1:58:11] him. And I said, "Stop lying to me." And
[1:58:14] he's like, "No, really. come you come to
[1:58:16] the the accident. So we went down there
[1:58:19] and he had Malachi or he had Genesis and
[1:58:22] Elijah in the car. Thankfully everybody
[1:58:25] is pretty much okay. Malachi is he has a
[1:58:28] back injury and a torn meniscus.
[1:58:32] But
[1:58:34] um our car would be really hard to sell
[1:58:37] and we've been just worried whether they
[1:58:39] were going to total it or what they were
[1:58:41] going to do. They finally called and
[1:58:43] said that they totaled it and they gave
[1:58:46] us $3,000 less than what I paid for it
[1:58:48] four years ago, which is about $5,000
[1:58:52] more than we could have sold it for.
[1:58:55] Amen.
[1:58:56] Good. God is merciful.
[1:59:05] I messaged Malachi because he kept
[1:59:07] saying, "Why, Mom? Why did it happen?
[1:59:08] Why did it happen? Why did it happen?"
[1:59:10] And I started getting on the same thing.
[1:59:11] Why? Why? Why? So, I was praying about
[1:59:14] it and I was like, "Why this? Why this?
[1:59:17] Why that?" And I felt like God was
[1:59:19] talking to me and he said, "Do you love
[1:59:20] me?" And I said, "Yes." He said, "Do you
[1:59:23] believe you are called?" I was like,
[1:59:25] "Yes, then why don't you believe my
[1:59:27] word?" And I was like, "What?" And he
[1:59:29] goes, "What's your favorite scripture?"
[1:59:31] I was like, "Romans 8:28." And he's
[1:59:33] like, "Well,
[1:59:35] then." So, I messaged that to Malachi
[1:59:38] and he said, "Is this even my mom?" But
[1:59:42] don't tell don't worry about Romans 8
[1:59:44] and all well Romans 8:28 all things work
[1:59:48] together for God are all things work
[1:59:50] together for good to them that are
[1:59:52] called and are to them that love God and
[1:59:54] to them that who are called according to
[1:59:56] his purpose. A perfect mess. Amen.
[2:00:00] That's good.
[2:00:08] I'm kind of like brother Jose. I don't
[2:00:10] talk. Um, public speaking and college
[2:00:13] algebra were nightmares in school. Um,
[2:00:17] but about 13 years ago, I think it's
[2:00:20] been about 13 years now, I was at Still
[2:00:22] Waters Camp around
[2:00:25] Jeffersonville, and I had just gotten
[2:00:27] through going through a very painful
[2:00:29] situation that happened to me actually
[2:00:31] in
[2:00:32] church. It scarred me. And it was Friday
[2:00:36] morning. And that was when we kind of
[2:00:37] had like our almost like a Sunday
[2:00:39] morning service. And brother Daniel
[2:00:42] probably remembers it was either Why
[2:00:43] Christ speak or by faith Moses. It was
[2:00:46] one of those two. I don't remember. We
[2:00:48] listen to one for quiet time and one
[2:00:49] Friday
[2:00:50] morning. But I just remember something
[2:00:53] about that
[2:00:55] service. I was convinced that I had a
[2:00:58] certain spirit on me and I heard it
[2:01:02] preached about all the time. You were
[2:01:03] hellbound if you were this way.
[2:01:06] And I just remember they had dismissed
[2:01:07] for the baptismal and I was just still
[2:01:09] sitting
[2:01:10] there crying, praying. And I felt
[2:01:14] somebody praying with me. And when I
[2:01:16] looked
[2:01:18] up, Daniel was there praying for me. And
[2:01:21] he looked at me. He said, "Whatever you
[2:01:22] were praying about is gone now." And I
[2:01:25] just looked him in the face. I said, "I
[2:01:27] need to be baptized." He said, "Well,
[2:01:29] let's go." And he drove me down there.
[2:01:32] Um, I'll be in 4 weeks. I'll be 30 years
[2:01:37] old. A few years after that, I left
[2:01:40] church. I left God. I got publicly
[2:01:44] humiliated from behind the pull pit
[2:01:46] after going through some other things.
[2:01:48] And I was like, you know what? I'm done.
[2:01:50] I went from one denomination to the
[2:01:52] other, one messed up situation to
[2:01:55] another.
[2:01:58] All those all these years
[2:02:01] later, this man right here kept, "You
[2:02:03] used to come to church with me." I was
[2:02:05] like, "I don't do message churches
[2:02:07] anymore." He's like, "Come to church
[2:02:09] with me." He's like, "You'll really like
[2:02:10] Brother Evans." And I was like, "Why do
[2:02:12] I know that
[2:02:14] name?" I come to church sitting here.
[2:02:18] Brother Daniel walks out that door up
[2:02:20] there and I was like, "I want to slide
[2:02:21] under the pew." I was like, "Uh-uh." I
[2:02:23] was like, "Nope."
[2:02:25] I felt so ashamed of myself. I really
[2:02:29] struggled in that service with anxiety,
[2:02:31] asthma attacks. Um, couple weeks later,
[2:02:34] I came back and I'll be honest, I was
[2:02:37] inappropriately dressed. I had on a pair
[2:02:40] of shorts. My mama would have taken me
[2:02:42] over her knee at 30 years of age and
[2:02:44] wore me out for walking into the house
[2:02:46] of the Lord the way I was dressed. And
[2:02:49] the churches I grew up in in Arkansas, I
[2:02:52] had my splits measured, had my heels
[2:02:54] measured. Deacons would meet girls at
[2:02:57] the door with measuring
[2:02:58] tape. I was in an attitude when I came
[2:03:01] to church. I'm not going to lie. Um, and
[2:03:04] I've prayed and asked the Lord to
[2:03:05] forgive me. I've asked Brother Daniel,
[2:03:07] too. Um, but when I walked in, Brother
[2:03:10] Daniel was standing in the back. He just
[2:03:13] shook my hand and said, "Good to see you
[2:03:15] back in church, Rebecca."
[2:03:17] I came and sat down and he silence can
[2:03:19] tell y'all I started crying. By the end
[2:03:22] of the service, I was under so much
[2:03:26] conviction. I hated
[2:03:28] myself. Any other churches that I knew,
[2:03:32] I would have been blasted at the front
[2:03:34] door and I would have gotten an attitude
[2:03:35] and been like, "Watch
[2:03:38] me." Um, I'm a preacher's daughter, by
[2:03:40] the way. We're the worst.
[2:03:42] Um,
[2:03:44] but over the last couple
[2:03:47] months when I first started coming to
[2:03:49] church, I was in a program and they were
[2:03:55] talking about, oh, you have a higher
[2:03:56] power, you know, letting God change your
[2:03:58] life. And I was like, I don't believe in
[2:04:00] all that. I was like, I don't pray. I
[2:04:02] don't have any faith. I was like, God's
[2:04:04] done with me. And I don't know, it's
[2:04:07] been maybe six weeks to two months ago
[2:04:09] on a Wednesday night. We listened to
[2:04:11] From That
[2:04:12] Time, I went up to the altar and just
[2:04:16] started crying, pouring my heart out to
[2:04:17] the Lord. Couple weeks ago, Brother
[2:04:20] Daniel preached on Saul and some stuff
[2:04:23] he said about it convicted me so much
[2:04:26] that for the first time in so many
[2:04:29] years, I finally was able to say, "I'm
[2:04:33] wrong. Yeah, this person wronged me.
[2:04:35] That person did this. But I have lived a
[2:04:40] horrible, horrible life to a point I was
[2:04:42] convinced I had gone beyond God's mercy
[2:04:46] line. And now I can sit
[2:04:48] here and
[2:04:54] say I shouldn't be alive right now. Five
[2:04:56] months ago, I was in a hospital after I
[2:04:59] tried to end my own life.
[2:05:03] I shouldn't be sitting here. I shouldn't
[2:05:05] be alive. I should be behind prison bars
[2:05:07] or six feet
[2:05:09] under. But I'm living out answers to
[2:05:13] prayers that I had forgotten I had
[2:05:15] prayed as a child. I grew up in the
[2:05:18] message. I got hurt. I went from this
[2:05:21] denomination to that denomination, one
[2:05:24] drug to the next drug, one man to the
[2:05:27] next man, looking for love, looking for
[2:05:30] answers.
[2:05:32] And I'm just I'm thankful because I
[2:05:35] don't deserve to be here, but I just
[2:05:37] wanted
[2:05:39] to I know none of that probably made any
[2:05:41] sense. I I don't know how to talk. Um
[2:05:44] but I thank God that 13 years ago,
[2:05:47] Brother Evans was there to confirm to
[2:05:51] me what I was praying about. And now I
[2:05:55] get to sit under his ministry. I'm
[2:05:57] growing. I am highly
[2:05:59] imperfect, but I am just I'm I'm very
[2:06:02] thankful for where God has brought me.
[2:06:06] Um so, and thank y'all for the love that
[2:06:09] y'all have shown me here in this church.
[2:06:11] It
[2:06:12] has genuinely made a difference in my
[2:06:15] faith, in people, in God.
[2:06:19] So, thank you to all of y'all and thank
[2:06:21] you, brother Daniel, for your
[2:06:23] encouragement and the ways that you've
[2:06:26] helped
[2:06:33] me. Now, I can say I can't talk.
[2:06:42] I saw when when um Rebecca came to the
[2:06:44] altar
[2:06:47] um was it after
[2:06:50] um the sermon on
[2:06:53] Saul and there was a
[2:06:55] change an amazing amazing
[2:06:59] change and I read in Colossians today
[2:07:03] for you are
[2:07:05] dead and now we put on that new life and
[2:07:09] that's what our sisters done And that's
[2:07:11] what so many of us have done. And we're
[2:07:14] going to keep going. We're going to keep
[2:07:16] doing this. We're going to keep getting
[2:07:17] these souls. We're going to keep
[2:07:19] bringing them in. We're going to keep
[2:07:20] witnessing to them. We're going to keep
[2:07:22] preaching the gospel. We're going to
[2:07:23] keep praying for the sick. We're going
[2:07:24] to keep serving God. Amen.
[2:07:31] Good, Johnny.
[2:07:35] Amen. Okay. Good. I've wondered. Okay.
[2:07:43] As you know, I've been in before. Some
[2:07:46] of you know who I am. Some of you don't
[2:07:49] know who I am. But one thing I want to
[2:07:52] say is God is a miracle. That's why I'm
[2:07:56] here today to share my testimony with
[2:08:00] you all. I am the person that God saved
[2:08:04] seven times. Amen for that.
[2:08:08] There's a song that I heard
[2:08:11] earlier that said, "He had touched me
[2:08:14] and he put me back together." Yes. I'm
[2:08:18] going to use those words. An example,
[2:08:20] when I was dying back in
[2:08:24] 2009, when the
[2:08:27] word touched
[2:08:29] me, when I was
[2:08:32] dying, those
[2:08:34] word touched my
[2:08:37] leg. And when I was
[2:08:41] dying and I heard those words, he
[2:08:44] touched me. He did touch me. He touched
[2:08:47] my name and he called my name. He
[2:08:50] touched my feet and he called my
[2:08:53] name. I was dying. There was no hope for
[2:08:56] me.
[2:08:58] I was on the list a couple not even on
[2:09:01] the list. There was people ahead of me.
[2:09:05] I didn't want the liver kidney
[2:09:07] transplant. I lived my life age 42. I
[2:09:11] should have been gone. But I'm still
[2:09:14] here as a miracle as you all are. Never
[2:09:18] give up on faith.
[2:09:20] Never. Amen. I'm a proof of testimony.
[2:09:25] That the man up there is a miracle for
[2:09:27] each and one of us. Amen. We are the
[2:09:30] children of God. No matter what we go
[2:09:33] through, we got to have our faith.
[2:09:36] Without faith, there's no miracle.
[2:09:39] You got to have faith to have miracle.
[2:09:42] just like me and all of
[2:09:44] us. And when I met, he put my pieces
[2:09:48] together. He knew I needed a liver and a
[2:09:53] kidney that will keep me going. And did
[2:09:57] he answer my prayer? Yes, he did. He put
[2:10:01] me back together with the pieces I
[2:10:04] needed to live my life.
[2:10:07] And I thank him for that every day,
[2:10:10] every morning, and every minute.
[2:10:14] I'm happy to be here. There's no regret
[2:10:16] of my life. I did used to have regret. I
[2:10:20] never believe in the Lord. But what
[2:10:23] happened to me got saved seven
[2:10:26] times. We all need to believe that
[2:10:29] miracle will happen. It takes time, but
[2:10:33] it's going to happen. Just like me.
[2:10:37] It's been 16 years I've been here and I
[2:10:40] thank the Lord and the person they gave
[2:10:43] me what I
[2:10:44] needed and may that person I don't know
[2:10:47] where she's at her family bless her
[2:10:50] family cuz the way they blessed me what
[2:10:53] I needed and may we all get blessed in
[2:10:58] life what we need to hear our spirit and
[2:11:01] our health in
[2:11:04] life
[2:11:05] Remember when you walk out these doors
[2:11:08] is to always love each other no matter
[2:11:11] what. Cuz once you walk out that door,
[2:11:14] you never know when you're going to come
[2:11:16] back. So you always love each other no
[2:11:20] matter what kind of day you're having
[2:11:22] when you walk out these
[2:11:23] doors because there's going to be
[2:11:26] somebody waiting and the man is going to
[2:11:28] be waiting for you to answer your
[2:11:31] prayers just like he did to mine. and he
[2:11:34] will answer to everybody in this house.
[2:11:37] And I just want to thank you all for
[2:11:39] being
[2:11:41] here. I mean, I don't know. It's just a
[2:11:44] miracle to see you guys here. And may
[2:11:48] God keep blessing you all as well as he
[2:11:52] did me. Thank you and amen.
[2:11:56] That's
[2:11:57] good. Praise God.
[2:12:03] the
[2:12:06] brothers we can uh we can make ready the
[2:12:12] um
[2:12:14] friends there's something greater than
[2:12:16] any force in the
[2:12:18] world and when people come into this
[2:12:22] sanctuary when people come into this
[2:12:25] building Rebecca said it Johnny said it
[2:12:30] Manny
[2:12:31] said it. Heath said it. When people come
[2:12:35] into this building and they are greeted
[2:12:38] with
[2:12:39] love, it is healing.
[2:12:42] There are miracles in
[2:12:49] love. I got to just share one more as we
[2:12:51] close. Let's all stand.
[2:13:04] Listen to
[2:13:06] this. 1 Corinthians 12 26. And whether
[2:13:09] one member suffers, all the members
[2:13:12] suffer with it. Or one member be
[2:13:15] honored, all the members rejoice with
[2:13:17] it. And that's where we we rejoice over
[2:13:20] these testimonies. We rejoice when
[2:13:22] something great happens. Rebecca, when
[2:13:25] you came up, I told my wife on the way
[2:13:27] home, "That girl has
[2:13:28] changed. She got past
[2:13:31] it." And we rejoice together when we see
[2:13:36] a healing, when we see a deliverance,
[2:13:39] when we see a stomach trouble leave,
[2:13:41] whatever it is, when one member suffers
[2:13:44] or or one member honors, all the members
[2:13:47] rejoice with
[2:13:49] it. Now, you are the body of Christ and
[2:13:51] members in particular. He didn't want
[2:13:54] anybody to to misunderstand what he was
[2:13:57] talking about. When one member suffers,
[2:14:00] all the members suffers. And you're the
[2:14:05] members. And God has set some in the
[2:14:07] church. First apostles, secondary
[2:14:09] prophets. Thirdly, teachers. After that,
[2:14:12] miracles, then gifts of healing, helps,
[2:14:14] governments, diversity of tongues. Are
[2:14:16] all
[2:14:17] apostles? Are all prophets? Are all
[2:14:20] teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
[2:14:22] have all the gifts of healing? Do all
[2:14:24] speak with tongues? Do all
[2:14:26] interpret, but covet earnestly the best
[2:14:30] gifts? And yet I show unto you a more
[2:14:35] excellent
[2:14:37] way. Though I speak with the tongue of
[2:14:40] men and angels, and have not charity,
[2:14:43] which is love, I am become as a sounding
[2:14:46] brass or a tinkling symbol. And though I
[2:14:48] have the gift of prophecy and understand
[2:14:50] all the mysteries and all the knowledge,
[2:14:52] and though I have all faith, so that I
[2:14:55] could remove mountains and have not
[2:14:58] love, I am
[2:15:01] nothing. Friends, love is
[2:15:04] powerful. There's healing, there's
[2:15:08] deliverance, and there's joy in
[2:15:14] love. You could put up verse one.
[2:15:20] a
[2:15:24] country. This is just what heaven means
[2:15:26] to me. Verse
[2:15:29] [Music]
[2:15:33] one. A country where no
[2:15:37] twilight shadows
[2:15:42] deepen. unending days where night will
[2:15:46] never
[2:15:50] be. Oh, a city where no storms will ever
[2:15:59] gather. Oh, this is just what heaven
[2:16:04] means to me.
[2:16:07] [Music]
[2:16:09] What will it be when we get over
[2:16:17] yonder and join the throne upon the
[2:16:21] glassy
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:25] sea to greet our loved ones and crown
[2:16:30] Christ forever.
[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:16:35] Oh, this is just what heaven means to
[2:16:39] me. And when at
[2:16:42] last and when at last we see the face of
[2:16:48] [Music]
[2:16:51] Jesus before whose image of their loves
[2:16:56] all
[2:16:58] flee. Hallelujah. And when they crown
[2:17:02] him Lord of all, I'll be
[2:17:07] there. Oh, this is just what heaven
[2:17:12] means to be a king.
[2:17:17] What will it be when we get over
[2:17:24] yonder and join the throng upon the
[2:17:29] glass sea
[2:17:32] sea to greet our loved ones and crown
[2:17:37] Christ forever.
[2:17:41] Oh, this is just what heaven means to
[2:17:46] me. And when at last, let's sing that
[2:17:48] verse
[2:17:49] again. And when at last we see the face
[2:17:54] of
[2:17:57] Jesus before whose
[2:18:01] image loves all flee.
[2:18:06] And when we crown him Lord of all, I'll
[2:18:11] be
[2:18:13] there. Oh, for this is just what heaven
[2:18:18] means to me.
[2:18:22] This what will it be when we get over
[2:18:28] [Music]
[2:18:30] yonder and joy the throng upon the
[2:18:34] glassy
[2:18:37] sea. Yes, we'll join our loved ones and
[2:18:41] crown Christ forever.
[2:18:47] Oh, this is just what heaven means to
[2:18:52] [Music]
[2:18:56] me. Let's Let's
[2:18:59] pray. Dear God, we thank you. Thank you
[2:19:02] for all these
[2:19:04] testimonies. Oh Lord, I can see how

[2:19:45] lives. Lord, you are

[2:19:55] sisters. It's been a good
