[35:51] to hear from the lord i'm here to hear
[35:54] from the lord i want
[35:55] this guy to be someplace
[35:58] else so that he can speak
[36:01] if we yield ourself help me lord jesus
[36:04] i'd
[36:04] wonder uh if we could just uh if we
[36:07] could just
[36:08] pray together for a moment or two here
[36:11] lord jesus
[36:12] lord we're here lord we we confess that
[36:15] we trust you with
[36:16] all of our heart lord and all our ways
[36:19] lord we strive to acknowledge you
[36:21] lord we lean not to our own
[36:24] understanding tonight lord but we trust
[36:26] you to direct our paths our words lord
[36:27] that nothing be said that would cause
[36:29] anyone to stumble or to stray
[36:31] but lord that could be you speaking to
[36:33] us lord we believe
[36:35] that you're still on the mercy seat not
[36:37] the judgment seat
[36:38] we believe that there is still grace
[36:40] lord to the to the unworthy to the
[36:43] unqualified and that certainly includes
[36:45] me
[36:45] lord jesus we just pray now that you'd
[36:47] be present you'd continue to be present
[36:50] as we share lord the thoughts that uh
[36:54] better hear that we believe are from you
[36:57] when we thank you in jesus precious name
[36:59] amen
[37:03] i'd like us to read together our
[37:06] opening verse and this seems to be on
[37:09] and that's a good thing
[37:11] uh and i'd like you to instead of just
[37:13] looking at the screen
[37:14] i'd like you to open your bible if
[37:16] you've got it with you that's great if
[37:18] you don't there's probably one in the
[37:19] seat pocket in front of you and
[37:20] if there's not then someone near you
[37:22] might have one that you can sort of
[37:24] look and see we're going to read
[37:28] from paul's letter to the philippians
[37:31] the fourth chapter
[37:34] the eighth verse
[37:40] yeah so i
[37:43] hope you've all found it that you're not
[37:45] cheating and looking up here
[37:47] there now you can't cheat okay so let's
[37:50] read together philippians chapter 4
[37:52] verse 8.
[37:53] finally brethren paul's summarizing
[37:56] something that he's
[37:57] been talking about whatsoever things are
[37:59] true
[38:01] whatsoever things are honest
[38:04] or just or pure
[38:07] or lovely or of good report
[38:10] if there's any virtue or any praise
[38:14] think on these things
[38:17] those things which you have both learned
[38:19] and received and heard and seen in me
[38:22] do and the god of peace
[38:26] shall be with you that sounds like a
[38:29] promise if we do
[38:30] our part he does his i think we heard
[38:32] something about that this morning
[38:33] brother aaron
[38:35] please be seated now
[38:38] this letter was written in greek not
[38:41] hebrew or aramaic
[38:43] and the word for peace here is not the
[38:45] word shalom as
[38:46] as we would think but it's a hebrew word
[38:50] that's irane
[38:53] strong's tells us that it's probably
[38:56] from a primary verb
[38:57] iran which means to join it
[39:01] it's about peace and and by implication
[39:03] brother peter it means
[39:04] prosperity and it
[39:08] it strong further goes on to say at one
[39:10] peace
[39:11] quietness rest said it one again
[39:15] so i hope everyone catches that when
[39:17] paul's talking about peace here
[39:19] he's not just talking about quietness
[39:21] he's talking about
[39:22] unity that's how one of the ways that we
[39:26] get peace
[39:27] how do we achieve this this unity this
[39:29] peace how do we get there
[39:31] well we just read it by purifying our
[39:33] minds
[39:34] purging our thoughts focusing on christ
[39:38] his word good things honest
[39:42] lovely pure good reports not
[39:45] gossip not tearing down forgiving
[39:49] offenses
[39:50] not harboring ill will
[39:53] well the title i've chosen for this
[39:57] evening's message is
[39:59] some other disciples we're going to
[40:02] touch on several disciples tonight but
[40:04] i want to focus on one in particular
[40:08] what made this disciple different
[40:12] than all the others but perhaps what we
[40:14] just read in philippians
[40:16] is part of it who
[40:19] brother who you talking about well i'm
[40:21] not going to tell you yet
[40:23] we'll we'll get there but first let's
[40:25] set the context
[40:27] last week was easter we had a wonderful
[40:31] series of meetings here the lord really
[40:32] moved in our midst and i'm
[40:34] so grateful we reviewed the events
[40:37] of the last few days of the life of
[40:39] christ
[40:41] from good friday and climaxing on easter
[40:46] i'd like us to go back to that eventful
[40:48] week
[40:49] not last week here in tucson tabernacle
[40:51] but
[40:52] all the way back to the first century
[40:56] let's try and imagine what it was like
[41:01] to be among his disciples at that time
[41:05] let's enter the room or the rooms that
[41:08] they were gathered in
[41:10] let's sit with them let's let's be a fly
[41:12] on the wall
[41:13] let's let's listen while they talk about
[41:16] the events
[41:18] while they think on these things
[41:21] as paul would later admonish try to
[41:25] imagine
[41:26] the uncertainty they felt what is this
[41:30] what happened what's going on
[41:32] to comprehend the incredulity of the
[41:34] events
[41:36] look on as they share the moments they
[41:38] cherished
[41:40] as well as those that brought shame
[41:44] come with me back to the first century
[41:49] into the environs of jerusalem
[41:52] let's join this small group of amazed
[41:55] and terrified
[41:56] people who follow jesus
[42:00] for some three years many of them had
[42:02] walked with jesus
[42:04] they'd heard him teach they'd witnessed
[42:07] miracle after miracle healings raising
[42:09] the dead
[42:11] opening of blind eyes they'd seen his
[42:14] humanity they'd seen him get tired
[42:16] they'd seen him groan with a headache
[42:18] they'd experienced his divinity
[42:22] a number of them at least 84
[42:25] had been sent out two by two to proclaim
[42:28] the gospel the good news
[42:31] of salvation given power to heal
[42:34] to cast out demons the first evangelists
[42:39] and that included judas iscariot we all
[42:43] know
[42:43] judas had issues but but remember the
[42:45] gospel of luke tells us
[42:47] it was after palm sunday and before
[42:50] monday thursday the last supper that
[42:53] that then
[42:54] entered satan into judas
[42:57] carry it being of the number of the
[42:59] twelve
[43:01] prior to that he wasn't possessed to the
[43:04] devil
[43:04] he was a thief he had weaknesses
[43:08] i have weaknesses paul said i must die
[43:11] daily
[43:12] it's a struggle it's a struggle to take
[43:14] up your cross and follow him
[43:17] some days more successful than others
[43:21] but judas isn't the guy we're going to
[43:23] talk about tonight
[43:25] and we call jesus followers his
[43:27] disciples
[43:28] all of the english translations from the
[43:30] king james all the way to the most
[43:32] modern new living translation when they
[43:33] come to these
[43:34] folks that says disciples
[43:40] disciple
[43:43] uh look here luke his disciples asked
[43:46] him saying what might this
[43:47] parable be what makes a person a
[43:50] disciple
[43:52] okay and another greek word we're not
[43:55] going to memorize greek words there's no
[43:57] test i just want to help set the context
[44:01] what are they talking about the
[44:02] mechanics if you will
[44:04] of the narrative we'll get to the
[44:06] dynamics the spirit and the life as
[44:09] as we go on the the word here is
[44:11] mathites
[44:13] it simply means a learner a pupil
[44:16] a disciple a student
[44:20] it doesn't mean it can mean other things
[44:23] we can
[44:24] ascribe other meanings to it but the
[44:26] basic meaning is
[44:27] a people a student one who's learning
[44:30] so so when we say disciple we're not
[44:32] talking about
[44:33] the 12 we're not limiting it to that or
[44:36] to the
[44:37] other 70 in the upper room
[44:40] at pentecost there were 120.
[44:44] if i could borrow and paraphrase a lie
[44:47] from
[44:48] brother john andes i would say it's
[44:50] sunday
[44:52] but pentecost is coming hang on
[44:56] the dynamics the power of the spirit
[44:59] will soon arrive
[45:01] will you be ready will
[45:04] lyle be ready i tend to get a bit
[45:08] technical at times
[45:09] that's part of my passion in the bible
[45:11] it's part of my nature it's how i'm
[45:13] wired
[45:14] the events of easter are often confused
[45:17] and mixed up the four gospels tell
[45:19] different parts
[45:21] of what happened that day some
[45:24] are explicit some are implied not stated
[45:27] clearly or
[45:28] or directly but maybe they're hinted at
[45:30] or or referred to
[45:34] now they're all accurate you can't say
[45:36] well
[45:37] well the bible is true but mark is more
[45:39] true than matthew
[45:41] or or john is less true than luke
[45:44] it's all true it all fits together it
[45:47] does not contradict
[45:50] so for example here's an example
[45:54] peter had a private meeting with the
[45:56] risen savior
[45:58] john tells us this so does paul
[46:01] but the recording of the event itself is
[46:04] is vague and
[46:06] and and indirect let's look at what paul
[46:09] relates
[46:10] paul tells us an order of events it's
[46:12] not a complete list
[46:14] but the items that it mentions are
[46:17] in order even if there are a number of
[46:20] gaps
[46:22] first corinthians 15 paul says i
[46:24] delivered unto you first of all
[46:26] that which i also received i passed it
[46:28] along
[46:29] how that christ died for our sins
[46:32] according to the scriptures
[46:34] and that he was buried and he rose again
[46:36] the third day
[46:37] according to the scriptures and that he
[46:39] was seen of cephas
[46:41] that's peter then of the 12.
[46:46] after that he was seen of more than 500
[46:49] people at once
[46:50] and after that he was seen of james this
[46:53] is the only record we have of that
[46:55] private meeting with james
[46:56] and then of all the apostles
[46:59] last of all he was seen of me also as of
[47:02] one
[47:03] born out of due time
[47:06] so paul is saying that before christ
[47:08] appeared to the 12
[47:10] and it's interesting he uses the 12
[47:11] because there weren't 12
[47:13] right there were 11. and in fact the
[47:15] first time there were only 10.
[47:16] so he's not talking about 12 as a number
[47:19] a body count if you will he's talking
[47:21] about the group that we think of
[47:23] usually when we think of the disciples
[47:27] but before he appeared to them he
[47:30] appeared to peter
[47:32] paul's very clear about that so so
[47:33] there's one witness that we have of
[47:35] peter having had a private meeting with
[47:37] the risen lord
[47:42] luke tells us that columbus
[47:45] clay cleopas and his companion had an
[47:48] encounter with the risen jesus at emmaus
[47:51] and rush back to jerusalem
[47:53] to tell of their experience we read
[47:55] about that in luke 24
[47:58] and they the travelers clampus and his
[48:00] companion rose up the same hour returned
[48:02] to jerusalem
[48:04] and found the eleven gathered together
[48:06] and them that were with them saying the
[48:08] lord has risen indeed and hath appeared
[48:10] to simon
[48:11] so they walk into this room in jerusalem
[48:14] maybe they have to knock on the door
[48:16] maybe it's locked
[48:17] we don't know how we don't know the
[48:18] steps are involved we know these guys
[48:20] are
[48:21] basically hiding they're they're scared
[48:24] they're
[48:25] uncertain what's really going on and
[48:28] and and they hear this group talking
[48:30] about that jesus
[48:31] has risen and that peter has seen him in
[48:33] and then it's it's their turn to chime
[48:35] in
[48:36] and and so they told what things were
[48:37] done in the way
[48:39] as they were walking to emmaus and how
[48:41] jesus
[48:42] was known to them and breaking of bread
[48:47] so we know of course that thomas must
[48:50] have left
[48:52] about this time because uh
[48:56] jesus is going to appear right after
[48:58] this or during this and
[48:59] thomas won't be there but we'll get to
[49:01] that later so there's no gospel account
[49:04] that describes peter's meeting with
[49:06] jesus
[49:06] but we do have these two witnesses that
[49:08] said in fact it happened
[49:10] it happened sometime after he
[49:13] went to the tomb and before the folks
[49:16] from emmaus arrived
[49:18] well let's look let's look when did
[49:20] peter go to the tomb
[49:21] how might this have happened john
[49:25] 20 starting at verse one the first day
[49:27] of the week
[49:28] easter morning right cometh mary
[49:30] magdalene
[49:31] early when it was yet dark
[49:36] it's not the rising of the sun it's not
[49:38] the pre-dawn light
[49:40] it's dark now we we know
[49:43] that there's a full moon because that's
[49:46] how it works that's how the jewish month
[49:48] is set up passover's a 14th day the
[49:50] month begins
[49:51] when the moon is a new moon right you
[49:53] can't see it so
[49:54] 14 days later you've got a full moon so
[49:56] there's moonlight
[49:58] but that's that's the light that there
[50:00] is
[50:01] so she goes to the sepulcher that's a
[50:04] dangerous thing for
[50:06] a woman to be doing by herself going out
[50:08] the gates of the city
[50:10] a very crowded city crowded with
[50:12] pilgrims one of the three festivals are
[50:14] ordered to go to jerusalem every year
[50:16] it's a pagan place by now run by the
[50:18] romans there's all sorts of
[50:20] opportunistic crime that can happen
[50:22] people hiding in some very dark shadows
[50:25] but she makes it there to the sepulcher
[50:27] and she sees the stone
[50:29] taken away from the sepulchre it doesn't
[50:32] say
[50:32] rolled away it says taken away well
[50:36] back to a little bit of greek here the
[50:38] the word here is
[50:40] ahiro and only john uses this word
[50:44] only john uses it and it means to loose
[50:48] or to remove and in other words the
[50:50] stone was
[50:51] displaced it was out of place the seal
[50:54] was broken
[50:54] it wasn't rolled away but it was
[51:00] shifted a bit the other gospels when we
[51:03] get to them will find all three other
[51:05] gospels
[51:06] it's rolled away the tomb entrance is
[51:08] totally open people can go in and out
[51:10] and that word they use there is apocalyo
[51:14] i'm sure that's what you really wanted
[51:15] to know is apocalyo right
[51:17] but it's a word that the other three
[51:19] gospels use and john doesn't it's a
[51:21] different
[51:22] time it's a different circumstance it's
[51:24] a different case
[51:26] and that word means rolled away so then
[51:28] it says
[51:29] and then she sauntereth
[51:32] no then she's strolleth
[51:36] no no she runneth
[51:40] she runs and comes to simon peter and
[51:42] the other disciples so she's left she's
[51:44] left that tomb the stone's
[51:46] moved she doesn't know what's going on
[51:49] she's alone it's outside it's dark it's
[51:53] outside the city walls what's going on
[51:55] she runs back she gets peter and john
[51:58] right says cometh to simon peter and the
[52:00] other disciple whom jesus loved
[52:03] john's gospel whenever he refers to
[52:04] himself he always talks about him being
[52:06] the one that jesus loved or the other
[52:08] guy or something he
[52:09] he never just comes out and says me that
[52:12] that's just
[52:13] john's nature we catch that as as we
[52:15] read his gospel
[52:17] so and so she runs and she says and i'm
[52:19] sure it's not she says oh
[52:21] guys by the way i think she's a little
[52:23] more excited than that
[52:24] they've taken away the lord out of the
[52:26] sepulcher
[52:27] we don't know where he's laid him what's
[52:29] going on guys help come come see
[52:31] oh
[52:35] peter therefore went forth
[52:39] went we see the next verse he ran but it
[52:42] says here
[52:42] he went forth and that other disciple
[52:45] john
[52:46] okay and came to the sepulcher they both
[52:49] ran together
[52:51] they ran what
[52:54] and and john outran peter and came first
[52:57] to the sepulcher
[52:59] and they both outran poor mary guys
[53:02] guys i came for some help
[53:05] they both outran mary oh
[53:08] oh she's struggling back there got her
[53:11] skirts hiked up and
[53:12] as you know a reasonable modest amount
[53:15] and is charging along the best she can
[53:17] right and so she sees these guys as they
[53:19] get there ahead of her
[53:20] yeah and and and uh what happens here
[53:24] so he this is john again john stoops
[53:27] down
[53:28] and he looks in and he sees the linen
[53:31] clothesline it's from the moonlight
[53:33] the sun hasn't come up yet they don't
[53:34] have street lights right
[53:37] then cometh simon peter following them
[53:40] he's an older guy kind not as old as me
[53:43] but but he's still huffing and puffing
[53:45] and so he he just went in
[53:48] get out of the way john and he just kind
[53:50] of wedges his way in there to see what's
[53:53] what's going on here and and what does
[53:55] he see
[53:56] he sees the linen clothes lying there
[54:00] and and the napkin the head cloth that
[54:03] was about his head
[54:04] not lying with the linen clothes but
[54:05] wrapped together in a place by itself
[54:09] and then went in also john
[54:13] and he saw and believed
[54:17] not quite sure what he believed but he
[54:19] saw what he saw and and
[54:21] and he had faith in what he saw and
[54:25] then john admits he says for his yet
[54:27] they knew not the scripture that he must
[54:29] rise again from the dead
[54:30] right psalms 16 10 for thou will not
[54:33] leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou
[54:35] serve for thy holy one to see corruption
[54:38] then the disciples and hear that term
[54:40] means peter and john
[54:41] went away again unto their own home
[54:46] they they didn't have an encounter with
[54:48] jesus
[54:50] they didn't see any angels what did they
[54:53] see
[54:55] linden wrappings and otherwise empty
[54:58] tomb
[55:00] maybe they only saw that because that's
[55:03] really all they were looking for now
[55:06] luke's gospel account of
[55:08] easter morning begins after
[55:11] the stone is rolled away not merely
[55:14] displaced
[55:14] like in john's gospel it's been rolled
[55:17] away by an angel accompanied by an
[55:19] earthquake as
[55:20] matthew relates to us luke tells us that
[55:23] some of jesus female followers met with
[55:25] quote two men in shining garments
[55:27] who told them jesus was risen and then
[55:31] returned from the sepulcher and told all
[55:34] these things
[55:35] unto the 11 and to all the rest it
[55:38] wasn't
[55:38] just the 11 or 12 disciples that were
[55:41] there
[55:42] there were there was a crowd we don't
[55:44] know how big it was
[55:46] but there were a lot of people there
[55:48] certainly more than 11.
[55:50] and luke tells us it was mary magdalene
[55:53] and joanna
[55:54] and mary the the mother of james and
[55:57] other women that were with him
[55:59] which told these things unto the
[56:00] apostles so
[56:02] we've got these these groups of of
[56:05] ladies that have come back
[56:08] and their words luke tells us
[56:12] seem to them as idle tales and they
[56:15] believed
[56:16] them not so clearly this is later in the
[56:19] day
[56:20] and it's a different event than that of
[56:22] a lone mary magdalene
[56:23] fetching peter and john watch
[56:27] watch now watch what happens then arose
[56:29] peter
[56:30] not peter and john it's not just a solo
[56:33] mission from mary magdalene
[56:34] that arose peter by himself
[56:37] ran unto the sepulcher again and
[56:40] stooping down he beheld the linen
[56:42] clothes laid by themselves
[56:45] and departed wondering himself at that
[56:48] which
[56:48] had come to pass so here we have peter
[56:50] by himself going to the tomb
[56:52] whose stone has now been rolled away not
[56:54] just displaced
[56:55] he goes inside he stoops down and again
[56:58] sees the lid and clothes
[57:00] i i think i don't know but i think it's
[57:02] likely this is when he met jesus
[57:05] it's the only account we have for peter
[57:07] being alone and his meeting with jesus
[57:09] was private as paul and those gathered
[57:11] when the travelers returned from emmaus
[57:13] are told that
[57:14] jesus had been seen by peter maybe it
[57:16] was later maybe it was after that
[57:18] we don't really know but perhaps his
[57:22] wondering it would have
[57:23] come to pass wasn't only about the
[57:24] resurrection but
[57:26] what had transpired in that meeting that
[57:28] he had peter is guilt-laden
[57:31] he is guilt-laden he publicly and
[57:33] vehemently denied that he even knew
[57:35] jesus and jesus caught his eye while he
[57:38] was being beaten
[57:39] as the rooster crowed and peter ran away
[57:42] he was miserable
[57:43] peter was just wracked with guilt
[57:48] peter needed healing peter needed
[57:53] to come to terms with this he needed to
[57:55] make this right he needed to confess
[57:57] his sin well
[58:01] as we sit remember we're back to being
[58:04] flies on the wall again
[58:06] as we sit and listen to these discussion
[58:08] and remembrance of the days
[58:10] we might hear others that are ashamed
[58:13] after all none of the twelve stuck
[58:16] around after gethsemane
[58:18] right they scattered john and peter were
[58:21] told ventured
[58:22] into the near the area where jesus was
[58:24] being abused
[58:26] peter left it dawn
[58:29] john stayed a bit longer we're told
[58:33] now there stood by the cross of jesus
[58:35] his mother
[58:37] and his mother's sister mary the wife of
[58:40] cleopas
[58:42] and mary magdalene when jesus therefore
[58:46] saw his mother and the disciples
[58:49] standing by whom he loved in other words
[58:51] john he said to his mother woman
[58:55] behold thy son and
[58:58] said he to john behold my mother
[59:04] and from that hour that disciple took
[59:07] her
[59:07] into his own home jesus
[59:10] asks john to take care of his mom
[59:14] john leads her away from that awful
[59:15] scene i can you imagine
[59:18] her heart must have just been crushed
[59:19] she sees her firstborn her son this
[59:22] miracle child crucified
[59:26] she can't tear herself away but she
[59:28] can't stand to be there either
[59:30] so jesus compassionate and caring even
[59:33] in his hour of extremity
[59:36] asks john to take care of her
[59:41] well when jesus died when he
[59:44] gave up the ghost when he yielded his
[59:46] spirit when the work
[59:48] was finished who came and took his body
[59:52] did the soldiers take his body what what
[59:54] what happened
[59:55] who removed it from the cross that must
[59:59] have been a grisly
[1:00:00] task who wrapped it and
[1:00:03] carried it put it in a nearby tune
[1:00:07] now this is the first century we're
[1:00:08] talking about a few weeks ago heather
[1:00:10] and i were in alexandria egypt and we
[1:00:12] went through the catacombs
[1:00:14] the area where christians had been
[1:00:16] buried in the you know i don't know if
[1:00:18] it was the first century might have been
[1:00:19] the second or third century by then
[1:00:22] very different variable practices from
[1:00:24] our day very different but
[1:00:26] but let's get back to the first century
[1:00:28] in that first easter who did this
[1:00:31] who took care of his body some of the 11
[1:00:34] disciples
[1:00:36] the ones he taught his closest friends
[1:00:39] those he empowered to preach and teach
[1:00:42] and heal
[1:00:43] and deliver no
[1:00:47] no it was two members of the sanhedrin
[1:00:53] the very council that had condemned him
[1:00:55] to death they weren't in agreement it
[1:00:56] wasn't a
[1:00:57] unanimous vote but they were members of
[1:01:00] the sanhedrin
[1:01:02] the very council one of them
[1:01:05] is a fellow named joseph from a town
[1:01:08] called aramatia
[1:01:10] we're told by luke he was an honorable
[1:01:12] counselor and did not agree with the
[1:01:13] rest of the council
[1:01:15] but he was a disciple of jesus
[1:01:18] we read in john after this joseph of
[1:01:21] arimathea
[1:01:22] being a disciple of jesus
[1:01:27] but secretly for fear of the jews
[1:01:30] besought pilate that other accounts say
[1:01:32] begged or craved
[1:01:34] went right into the lion's den the very
[1:01:36] guy that had said
[1:01:38] see you to it condemn this guy crucify
[1:01:40] him
[1:01:41] he went to pilate i don't think this was
[1:01:44] secret
[1:01:45] and he begged him that he might take
[1:01:47] away the body of jesus
[1:01:50] and pilate gave him leave he came
[1:01:54] therefore and took the body of jesus now
[1:01:57] the gospel of john here says that he's a
[1:01:59] disciple but secretly for fear of the
[1:02:01] jews
[1:02:02] what is he in fear of really i think
[1:02:03] he's in fear of his position he's going
[1:02:05] to be kicked off the council lose his
[1:02:06] influence
[1:02:08] that sort of thing i don't think that he
[1:02:09] was in fear of his life
[1:02:12] he'd been a disciple for a while while
[1:02:14] jesus wasn't under threat of death but
[1:02:16] still secret joseph of pharmacy is
[1:02:20] mentioned in all four
[1:02:21] gospel accounts mark and luke
[1:02:24] and their account they tell us that he
[1:02:26] took the body down
[1:02:29] meaning i think that he removed it from
[1:02:32] the cross what a task
[1:02:36] who's the other person who's the other
[1:02:38] person
[1:02:39] that helped in all this nicodemus
[1:02:43] yeah the guy that came by night
[1:02:45] nicodemus brought spices and linen
[1:02:47] together we're told they transported
[1:02:50] anointed
[1:02:51] wrapped his body together
[1:02:54] they carried it to joseph's tomb
[1:02:58] joseph we're told rolled a great stone
[1:03:00] over the entrance to the tomb
[1:03:02] the next day the guards came and secured
[1:03:04] the tomb which i think means they looked
[1:03:06] inside to be sure the body hadn't been
[1:03:07] stolen or removed yet
[1:03:09] and then they sealed it
[1:03:13] well who knew where the tomb was
[1:03:16] mary magdalene and we're told another
[1:03:18] mary
[1:03:19] there are five other mary's in the new
[1:03:21] testament at least four of them appear
[1:03:22] in the gospels it gets a little bit
[1:03:24] confusing and
[1:03:25] say hello mary and half the people raise
[1:03:27] their hand it's it's
[1:03:28] a little difficult but but these two
[1:03:31] marys
[1:03:32] watched joseph and nicodemus
[1:03:36] and noted where jesus body was entombed
[1:03:41] the 12 or the 11 now
[1:03:44] nowhere to be seen isn't it interesting
[1:03:49] and so very sad that those who stood by
[1:03:52] him in the good times were nowhere to be
[1:03:54] seen in the bad times
[1:03:57] to be identified with him during his
[1:03:59] ministry were unafraid
[1:04:01] to be seen caring for his body after the
[1:04:03] awful crucifixion
[1:04:06] even to confronting the very man who
[1:04:08] ordered the crucifixion how willing are
[1:04:12] we
[1:04:13] to be identified with him today amid
[1:04:16] scoffing
[1:04:17] politicization nowadays you say you're
[1:04:19] christian oh you
[1:04:21] you're one of those guys that stormed
[1:04:22] the capitol you're one of those
[1:04:24] anti-vaxxers or or you're just a
[1:04:27] gullible believer in myths and
[1:04:29] fairy tales joseph and nicodemus stood
[1:04:33] up
[1:04:34] in the face of opposition and rendered
[1:04:37] care and dignity
[1:04:38] to the body of jesus god often has
[1:04:42] people who seem invisible remember when
[1:04:44] elijah was in the cave and he was
[1:04:45] whining
[1:04:46] and god said i've got seven thousand
[1:04:49] that happened bowed the knee
[1:04:51] they were invisible to elijah to the
[1:04:53] prophet they were invisible
[1:04:55] but they were there but at the right
[1:04:58] moment
[1:04:58] it seems that these people come out of
[1:05:00] the woodwork
[1:05:02] they perform some crucial task in his
[1:05:04] plan
[1:05:05] and then maybe they fade back into the
[1:05:07] shadows again
[1:05:09] even today but the disciple i want to
[1:05:12] focus on for the next few minutes
[1:05:14] the mystery disciple this evening is
[1:05:16] mary magdalene
[1:05:19] all four gospels tell the various
[1:05:22] aspects
[1:05:22] of her role at the crucifixion and the
[1:05:25] resurrection
[1:05:27] excuse me
[1:05:31] mark tells us that jesus had previously
[1:05:34] cast seven devils out of her
[1:05:37] luke's gospel is the only one that
[1:05:39] mentions her
[1:05:40] prior to the events of that passion week
[1:05:46] let's read that
[1:05:52] luke uh chapter eight verse one it says
[1:05:54] and it came to pass afterward
[1:05:55] what is the afterword referring to the
[1:05:58] event just prior to this
[1:06:00] was jesus was at the house of a pharisee
[1:06:04] named simon he'd been invited there but
[1:06:06] he'd been ignored nobody washed his feet
[1:06:08] nobody did anything
[1:06:10] and an unnamed lady came
[1:06:14] washed his feet with her tears wiped his
[1:06:17] feet with her hair
[1:06:20] jesus scolded simon talked about
[1:06:24] to whom much is forgiven there's much
[1:06:27] love
[1:06:28] and forgave that woman over sin some
[1:06:30] people
[1:06:31] assert that that was mary magdalene we
[1:06:33] don't know it doesn't say
[1:06:35] it doesn't say but after that after that
[1:06:38] event he went throughout every city and
[1:06:40] village
[1:06:40] preaching and showing the glad tidings
[1:06:42] of the kingdom of god
[1:06:43] and the 12 were with him who else was
[1:06:46] with him
[1:06:47] certain women which had been healed of
[1:06:51] evil spirits and infirmities more than
[1:06:53] one
[1:06:54] mary called magdalene out of whom went
[1:06:57] seven devils that's the first mention of
[1:06:59] this
[1:07:00] and joanna the wife of husa herod's
[1:07:03] steward
[1:07:04] had susanna and many others
[1:07:07] which ministered unto him of their
[1:07:10] substance
[1:07:12] the guys were out spreading the word
[1:07:16] the ladies were providing the support
[1:07:19] well you say okay okay brother but does
[1:07:22] that make her a disciple
[1:07:26] well come with me come with me let's
[1:07:30] let's listen in let's get in that room
[1:07:33] and and let's hear
[1:07:34] mary relating her experiences that
[1:07:37] morning to the others that are
[1:07:39] gathered there that afternoon and and
[1:07:40] now the
[1:07:42] this is mary speaking and i'm
[1:07:43] dramatizing this of course but
[1:07:45] but it it was early it's well before
[1:07:48] sunrise
[1:07:49] and in the evening i had gone with mary
[1:07:52] and siloam to buy spices to anoint his
[1:07:54] body
[1:07:55] but but i remembered he told us many
[1:07:58] times
[1:07:59] that he would be given over to sinners
[1:08:01] and killed
[1:08:02] and it would rise on the third day i
[1:08:05] didn't know what to think
[1:08:07] what does that even mean here in
[1:08:10] jerusalem
[1:08:11] it's really crowded passover is one of
[1:08:14] the three times that observant jews like
[1:08:17] us
[1:08:17] are required to come to the city there
[1:08:20] are lots of pagans here all sorts of
[1:08:21] people
[1:08:22] taking advantage of the pilgrims
[1:08:24] harassing
[1:08:25] robbing beating what does this place
[1:08:28] come to
[1:08:30] anyway there's a full moon and i just
[1:08:33] couldn't shake the idea that today
[1:08:35] something momentous was going to happen
[1:08:37] something inside of me was just drawing
[1:08:40] me pulling me tugging at my heart
[1:08:42] to go to the tomb where mary and i had
[1:08:44] seen joseph and nicodemus
[1:08:46] place his body i we knew the tomb was
[1:08:50] sealed
[1:08:52] i just couldn't sleep so i got up
[1:08:55] dressed slipped out of the place where
[1:08:57] i'm staying
[1:08:59] i carefully made my way to the damascus
[1:09:02] road
[1:09:03] which passes by that awful golgotha
[1:09:07] to get to the tomb it's a full moon of
[1:09:10] course
[1:09:10] it's passover right so so i i can see
[1:09:13] where i was going but
[1:09:15] but i hurried along there's no telling
[1:09:17] who
[1:09:18] or what might be lurking in the shadows
[1:09:21] and i was going by myself out of the
[1:09:24] city
[1:09:25] into the countryside nervous
[1:09:28] of course nervous i came to the tomb
[1:09:31] with without any problem
[1:09:33] i i didn't see the guards i
[1:09:36] approached the tomb
[1:09:39] i had no idea what to expect but i never
[1:09:43] expected to see that stone displaced
[1:09:47] i was i was afraid
[1:09:50] i hitched up my skirt and ran for all i
[1:09:52] was worth back to the city gate
[1:09:54] i went to the place i knew where peter
[1:09:56] and john were sleeping
[1:09:58] i awakened them guys
[1:10:01] wake up wake up i was nervous i was
[1:10:04] scared
[1:10:06] i didn't know what to think i just bored
[1:10:09] it out to those who
[1:10:10] jesus bodies been removed from the tomb
[1:10:13] where mighty be i was i was so upset and
[1:10:16] so scared
[1:10:18] these two guys they woke up
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:23] they woke up and then they looked at
[1:10:25] each other
[1:10:28] they looked at me and then they ran to
[1:10:31] the tomb
[1:10:33] hey wait for me i ran after them
[1:10:37] it would have been nice if they'd waited
[1:10:38] for me so we could go together but
[1:10:41] you know them well as i approached the
[1:10:44] tomb
[1:10:45] i could see them stooping over and
[1:10:48] peering in
[1:10:49] john was there but peter shoved them
[1:10:52] aside and crawled into the tomb
[1:10:54] that's peter bull in a china closet but
[1:10:57] but a moment later
[1:10:58] john followed him inside by the time i
[1:11:01] got there
[1:11:02] they had just exited the tomb and they
[1:11:04] were talking to each other and hurrying
[1:11:06] back to the city
[1:11:08] i heard them say there's just a grave
[1:11:10] close inside what what happened
[1:11:12] they seem perplexed and who wouldn't be
[1:11:15] they brushed past me as if i weren't
[1:11:17] there continued on their way
[1:11:21] i was exhausted i've run both ways
[1:11:24] already i'm
[1:11:24] not a marathon person i don't
[1:11:27] participate in the olympics here
[1:11:30] i was anxious they left me alone in that
[1:11:33] place
[1:11:34] i was hurt i was being ignored by the
[1:11:37] people that i came to for help
[1:11:39] so i did what any self-respecting woman
[1:11:42] would do when she's at her wit's end
[1:11:44] i bawled i cried
[1:11:47] and though still in tears
[1:11:51] weeping uncontrollably i leaned over and
[1:11:54] looked inside
[1:11:56] to see what are they talking about
[1:11:59] there was still enough light from the
[1:12:01] setting of the full moon to see inside
[1:12:03] if i really concentrated i was squinting
[1:12:05] through my tears
[1:12:07] i expected to see the linen grave
[1:12:09] clothes peter and john have been talking
[1:12:11] about as they left only a moment before
[1:12:13] but but but jesus told us
[1:12:17] about more than that and i saw
[1:12:22] something more well
[1:12:25] let's leave mary we'll we'll come right
[1:12:27] back we'll let's see what john writes
[1:12:29] about this moment
[1:12:32] mary stood without at the sepulcher
[1:12:34] weeping
[1:12:36] and as she wept she stooped down and
[1:12:39] looked
[1:12:39] into the sepulcher
[1:12:43] and saw two angels
[1:12:46] in white sitting
[1:12:49] one at the head the other at the feet
[1:12:52] where the body of jesus had lain
[1:12:57] had lain it was gone
[1:13:01] and they say unto her mary speechless
[1:13:04] right they say unto her woman why
[1:13:08] weepest thou
[1:13:10] she saith unto them because they've
[1:13:13] taken away my lord
[1:13:14] i know not where they have laid him
[1:13:18] let's get back to mary i saw two angels
[1:13:21] they asked me why are you crying
[1:13:24] can you imagine i told them what should
[1:13:27] have been obvious
[1:13:29] someone took the body of jesus i don't
[1:13:31] know where he is
[1:13:32] is he is he somehow really alive and
[1:13:35] someone has taken him somewhere to get
[1:13:36] refreshed
[1:13:38] a more comfortable place in a tomb maybe
[1:13:40] to lay down and rest or
[1:13:41] maybe they went to breakfast somewhere i
[1:13:43] don't know what's going on
[1:13:46] and why did they ask me anyway they're
[1:13:48] angels
[1:13:49] why did they ask me i i didn't know
[1:13:51] that's why i was there how could i know
[1:13:53] hello well we'll leave
[1:13:56] mary again for a moment but we'll come
[1:13:58] back to hear her story
[1:14:01] i'd like us to go to the book of exodus
[1:14:04] chapter 25.
[1:14:06] now jesus confirmed to us in the gospels
[1:14:08] that moses in fact wrote
[1:14:10] the first five books there's a very
[1:14:13] interesting investigation at least
[1:14:15] i find it interesting maybe we can delve
[1:14:17] into that someday about how it was
[1:14:19] possible that moses could have actually
[1:14:21] written those books but at this point
[1:14:26] jesus has vouched for the authenticity
[1:14:28] and
[1:14:29] that's good enough for me exodus
[1:14:32] 25 we'll read a few verses here i want
[1:14:34] you to get a picture
[1:14:35] i want you to remember what mary saw in
[1:14:37] the tomb
[1:14:39] and then i want you to superimpose that
[1:14:42] with this they shall make an arc of
[1:14:44] em wood
[1:14:45] two cubits and a half she'll be the
[1:14:46] length of the cube and a half the
[1:14:48] brethren a cubit and a half the height
[1:14:49] thereof so this thing is
[1:14:51] three and a half feet by a little under
[1:14:52] two feet or something
[1:14:55] it's made out of wood it's a wooden box
[1:14:58] right
[1:14:58] and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold
[1:15:00] within and without thou shall overlay it
[1:15:02] shall make a pondered a crown of gold
[1:15:04] round about that a little ridge and
[1:15:06] edging
[1:15:06] right sticking up so that when you put
[1:15:08] the lid on it doesn't just slide
[1:15:10] over it's going to bump into that that
[1:15:12] crown so
[1:15:13] so we've got a wooden box it's covered
[1:15:15] with gold foil
[1:15:17] and there's a rimmer crown around the
[1:15:19] top to keep the lid from falling off
[1:15:22] verse 16 and thou shalt put into the ark
[1:15:24] into this box
[1:15:25] the testimony which i shall give thee so
[1:15:27] this box is going to carry a copy
[1:15:30] of the revealed word of moses day that's
[1:15:32] what's going to be in it
[1:15:34] and thou shalt make a mercy seat
[1:15:38] not a judgment seat a mercy seat of pure
[1:15:41] gold
[1:15:42] two cubits and a half should be the
[1:15:43] length of and a cube and a half the
[1:15:44] breath around in other words this is a
[1:15:46] lid
[1:15:47] that fits perfectly on this box
[1:15:51] and thou shalt make two cherubs of gold
[1:15:53] oh angels
[1:15:55] of beaten workshop thou make them in the
[1:15:57] two ends
[1:15:59] of the mercy seat
[1:16:02] two angels one at the head the other at
[1:16:04] the feet
[1:16:06] perched on the mercy seat not the
[1:16:08] judgment seat
[1:16:11] verse 21 thou shalt put the mercy seat
[1:16:14] above upon the ark
[1:16:15] and in the ark thou shall put the
[1:16:17] testimony i shall give thee
[1:16:19] the words hidden in the ark by word lord
[1:16:22] have i hid in my heart
[1:16:24] it's covered by mercy the same mercy
[1:16:26] that we depend on what well then what
[1:16:28] what
[1:16:28] after you do this what's going to happen
[1:16:32] and there will i meet with thee and i
[1:16:34] will commune with thee from above the
[1:16:36] mercy seat from between the two
[1:16:38] angels which are upon the ark of the
[1:16:40] testimony of all things which i shall
[1:16:42] give thee in commandment unto the
[1:16:43] children of israel
[1:16:46] wow we have this in exodus
[1:16:49] we have this picture of things and in
[1:16:52] the tomb we have
[1:16:54] the same thing yeah certainly very
[1:16:56] similar so
[1:16:57] peter and john they were looking for a
[1:17:00] physical
[1:17:00] dead body they saw evidence a body had
[1:17:03] been there
[1:17:04] but remember they didn't even know where
[1:17:05] the tomb was at least we don't know that
[1:17:07] they knew
[1:17:09] peter was hiding john was taking care of
[1:17:11] jesus mom
[1:17:13] only mary and mary saw jesus body being
[1:17:16] put in the tomb and of course nicodemus
[1:17:18] and
[1:17:18] and uh joseph of arimathea knew of it
[1:17:21] and the guards knew of it
[1:17:23] perhaps some of the other sisters had
[1:17:25] also seen the
[1:17:26] body being put in but mary magdalene's
[1:17:30] vision
[1:17:31] wasn't limited to searching for a
[1:17:33] physical body
[1:17:35] something was burning in her heart
[1:17:38] something was burning in her soul she
[1:17:40] wasn't lugging
[1:17:40] jars of ointment or boxes of spices
[1:17:44] she wasn't coming to do what jewish
[1:17:45] women did in those days as part of the
[1:17:47] beginning of a morning period
[1:17:49] to anoint a corpse she wasn't looking
[1:17:52] for a corpse
[1:17:53] she didn't know what she would find but
[1:17:56] she was looking for jesus
[1:17:59] his word was hidden in her heart
[1:18:02] she was a disciple she was a student she
[1:18:04] paid attention
[1:18:05] to her teacher a single
[1:18:08] vulnerable woman in a scary place
[1:18:11] abandoned by the two disciples she'd
[1:18:13] recruited to help her
[1:18:15] a bit like jesus abandoned by the
[1:18:18] disciples
[1:18:20] the morning of his triumph no one
[1:18:23] welcomes him
[1:18:25] no one's there to celebrate his hard-won
[1:18:27] victory
[1:18:29] no one's looking for him they're hiding
[1:18:32] oh wait there was one
[1:18:36] there was one let's read again from
[1:18:38] john's account
[1:18:40] i love this story not a story like
[1:18:42] fiction
[1:18:44] this is the most important story that's
[1:18:46] ever been told
[1:18:48] it's been brought to us over the
[1:18:49] centuries by faithful witnesses
[1:18:51] who risked all that we could have the
[1:18:55] opportunity to learn of it
[1:18:56] and become part of it ourselves
[1:19:01] john 20 starting at verse 14. and when
[1:19:04] she that's mary magdalene had thus said
[1:19:08] about these angels right she turned
[1:19:10] herself back
[1:19:11] and saw jesus standing
[1:19:15] and knew not that it was jesus
[1:19:20] she didn't recognize him and jesus spoke
[1:19:23] to her
[1:19:25] woman why are you weeping
[1:19:28] who are you looking for
[1:19:32] she supposing him to be the gardener
[1:19:35] said unto him sir if i have borne him
[1:19:38] hence
[1:19:40] tell me where you've laid him and i'll
[1:19:42] take him away
[1:19:43] i'll take care of him
[1:19:47] i love this i'm sorry jesus was the
[1:19:49] second adam right
[1:19:50] there was adam number one back in the
[1:19:52] garden of eden here's adam number two
[1:19:54] who'd
[1:19:55] been in gethsemane now he's in a garden
[1:19:57] tomb right
[1:19:59] and and and and she thinks he's the
[1:20:03] gardener
[1:20:04] adam was a gardener you say well wait a
[1:20:06] minute adam was the garden of eden that
[1:20:08] was just a perfect place wait
[1:20:10] wait and in genesis 2 15 we're told that
[1:20:14] god put adam in the garden to work to
[1:20:17] work peter
[1:20:18] put him there to work well wait a minute
[1:20:22] brother while the garden was perfect it
[1:20:24] didn't need anybody to work in there
[1:20:25] there weren't weeds nothing needed to be
[1:20:27] trimmed
[1:20:29] is that really what the bible says
[1:20:32] genesis 2 15 the lord god took the man
[1:20:37] and put him into the garden of eden why
[1:20:40] to dress it and to keep it if what does
[1:20:43] a fine dresser do
[1:20:45] kick back drink lemonade and wait for
[1:20:47] the grapes no
[1:20:49] he's trimming it he's doing stuff he's
[1:20:50] pruning it he's taking care of it he's
[1:20:52] making sure that everything is just
[1:20:54] right that it's got the right
[1:20:55] environment
[1:20:56] there's this whole garden of eden to
[1:20:58] take care of there's two people in there
[1:21:00] there's adam and eve
[1:21:02] they've got a job to do we're told that
[1:21:04] god came down and communed with adam in
[1:21:06] the cool of the evening
[1:21:08] maybe it's after the work day is done
[1:21:09] he's punched out right
[1:21:11] now he can relax and commune with god
[1:21:14] hey
[1:21:15] hey adam i like how you trim that bush
[1:21:17] over there
[1:21:18] that's good oh yeah you've had this
[1:21:20] inspiration and the two of us worked
[1:21:21] together we got that done
[1:21:22] good job adam you're taking care of the
[1:21:24] garden just like i told you
[1:21:26] that's that's just me maybe i'm wrong
[1:21:28] but he said he was put there to address
[1:21:30] it
[1:21:30] and to keep it so
[1:21:34] god worked right days of creation after
[1:21:37] it said god rested if he rested he must
[1:21:39] have worked or why would he need to rest
[1:21:42] adam rested the cool of the evening okay
[1:21:45] get back to
[1:21:46] we're we're way way behind here let's
[1:21:49] get going
[1:21:51] while you got to get moving here okay
[1:21:54] back to back to the garden here so jesus
[1:21:57] said to her
[1:21:58] after he said why are you weeping and
[1:22:00] she says i'm looking for jesus
[1:22:02] right jesus said unto her mary
[1:22:07] she turned herself up till now she's
[1:22:09] seen the gardener there but her eyes
[1:22:10] have been averted we're not really sure
[1:22:12] why but it appears that her eyes were
[1:22:14] averted a little bit as she was talking
[1:22:15] kind of maybe out of the side of her
[1:22:16] mouth or something we don't really know
[1:22:19] but now she turns to face him full on
[1:22:23] she turned herself and saith unto him
[1:22:25] rabboni
[1:22:27] which is to say master now this isn't
[1:22:29] mass like master slave kind of thing
[1:22:32] rabbi just the word rabbi means
[1:22:35] a teacher or a master in that sense
[1:22:38] but this is a personal possessive form
[1:22:40] robonai means
[1:22:42] my teacher my master
[1:22:46] and he didn't deny it he didn't say i'm
[1:22:49] not your
[1:22:50] master he didn't deny it so by
[1:22:54] implication he acknowledges her as
[1:22:56] my student right by definition
[1:23:00] disciple jesus said unto her
[1:23:04] touch me not she's turned to him
[1:23:07] my master don't don't touch me don't
[1:23:10] touch me
[1:23:11] i'm not yet ascended to my father but go
[1:23:14] to my brethren and say unto them that
[1:23:16] i ascend to my father and your father
[1:23:21] to my god and your god
[1:23:25] mary magdalene came and told the
[1:23:27] disciples
[1:23:28] that she had seen the lord and she had
[1:23:30] spo and that he had spoken these things
[1:23:32] under her
[1:23:33] she's a faithful witness whoa it was
[1:23:36] true what he said
[1:23:38] now i know what it means because god has
[1:23:41] interpreted his word by bringing it to
[1:23:43] pass
[1:23:43] and i've seen it so
[1:23:46] she knew that jesus said he'd return
[1:23:49] from the grave
[1:23:50] this is the third day why no one else
[1:23:53] was there was
[1:23:55] not her concern she just had to come and
[1:23:58] see
[1:23:59] not to scoff or doubt but to see what's
[1:24:02] going on here well
[1:24:05] why did mary see the angels and peter
[1:24:08] and john at virtually the same moment
[1:24:10] didn't
[1:24:11] they took their heads out they got out
[1:24:13] of the tomb they headed out
[1:24:14] she put her head in and there was angels
[1:24:17] there did they wait for john and peter
[1:24:19] to
[1:24:19] leave and then they suddenly appeared
[1:24:23] i don't think so i of course this is
[1:24:25] just me this is speculation
[1:24:27] right but but peter and john and the
[1:24:31] others
[1:24:31] they'd witnessed jesus ministry at as
[1:24:34] had mary
[1:24:36] peter and john and the other disciples
[1:24:38] they had participated in it preaching
[1:24:40] and teaching and healing and delivering
[1:24:42] having power over evil spirits
[1:24:44] they were the ushers sitting the crowds
[1:24:46] oh there's five thousand sit them down
[1:24:47] here in groups of fifty and then we'll
[1:24:48] feed these five thousand people right
[1:24:51] they were the deacons right serving the
[1:24:53] meal they were the
[1:24:54] cleanup crew right they issued the
[1:24:57] prayer cards and jesus said
[1:24:58] let the children come right
[1:25:02] we have no record of any of those men
[1:25:05] being delivered or demons or devils
[1:25:08] or evil spirits coming out of them but
[1:25:11] mary magdalene
[1:25:13] had seven devils cast out of her
[1:25:17] she wasn't just managing the prayer line
[1:25:19] she was in
[1:25:20] the prayer line she had
[1:25:24] that spiritual experience and like
[1:25:26] elisha praying that the eyes of his
[1:25:28] servant might be open to see the host
[1:25:30] the chariots of fire that were around
[1:25:32] them to protect them from the syrians
[1:25:35] so mary was privileged to see the angels
[1:25:39] seated in the tomb not peter
[1:25:42] not john they were looking for a corpse
[1:25:47] but mary was looking for a living lord
[1:25:51] she didn't understand she'd heard
[1:25:54] and believed even though she didn't
[1:25:56] understand she still believed that she
[1:25:58] didn't claim some special revelation
[1:26:00] she didn't claim some interpretation i'm
[1:26:02] going to go to the tomb and i'm going to
[1:26:03] see two angels and
[1:26:05] no no nothing dramatic about it
[1:26:08] she was just open to receive whatever
[1:26:11] the lord had for her whatever
[1:26:12] he meant when he told her that he would
[1:26:15] rise again on the third day
[1:26:17] and she didn't just sit back and say
[1:26:19] well if he rises again on the third day
[1:26:20] he knows my address he'll come here
[1:26:22] no she put action to her face she went
[1:26:24] looking for him
[1:26:26] she put herself in danger she put
[1:26:28] herself at risk
[1:26:30] and she of all the followers of jesus of
[1:26:35] all the disciples was the first
[1:26:39] to see him john tells the story
[1:26:44] mark attests to it let's let's look here
[1:26:46] in mark now when jesus was risen early
[1:26:48] the first day of the week
[1:26:50] he appeared first to mary magdalene out
[1:26:52] of whom he had cast seven devils
[1:26:56] he doesn't record that but it happened
[1:26:58] but he tells us that it
[1:27:00] had happened right and she went and told
[1:27:02] them
[1:27:03] that had been with him as they mourned
[1:27:07] and wept and they
[1:27:11] when they heard that he was alive and
[1:27:13] had been seen of her
[1:27:15] believe not it wasn't just the 11 or the
[1:27:19] 12
[1:27:20] and it wasn't just the men that scoffed
[1:27:23] at her testimony
[1:27:26] well that doesn't match my revelation of
[1:27:28] what jesus meant
[1:27:30] well that's not how i heard the prophet
[1:27:32] proclaim it
[1:27:33] no the other women it says then that had
[1:27:36] been with him
[1:27:39] also doubted her story she was alone
[1:27:44] oh mary you get so emotional
[1:27:47] you've had a terrible shock look peter
[1:27:49] and john were there at the same time and
[1:27:51] they didn't see any angels they didn't
[1:27:53] encounter jesus
[1:27:54] you're hallucinating or the strains just
[1:27:57] too much
[1:27:58] you've always had such an imagination
[1:28:00] mary
[1:28:02] and look at you you've run back and
[1:28:04] forth you're exhausted
[1:28:06] all this running about and in the dark
[1:28:08] besides you're lucky you weren't
[1:28:10] accosted
[1:28:11] have a cup of tea dear it'll soothe you
[1:28:15] well let's pick up the story again maybe
[1:28:18] the
[1:28:18] the other mary might have turned to mary
[1:28:21] magdalene and says something like
[1:28:23] let's go to the tomb dear together so
[1:28:26] we'll be safe enough it'll soon be light
[1:28:29] you'll see it's just your nervous
[1:28:31] disposition come on now i'll go with you
[1:28:32] let's go
[1:28:35] so what does matthew tell us about this
[1:28:38] in the end of the sabbath as it began to
[1:28:40] dawn it's no longer dark
[1:28:42] it's we're getting right there we're
[1:28:44] getting the light
[1:28:46] for the day the first day they became
[1:28:48] mary magdalene and the
[1:28:49] other mary to see this evil car
[1:28:53] and behold there was a great earthquake
[1:28:55] for the angel of the lord descended from
[1:28:57] heaven and came and rolled back
[1:28:59] the stone from the door the stone had
[1:29:02] not been rolled back
[1:29:04] it was displaced now it's rolled back
[1:29:07] and this angel his countenance was like
[1:29:09] lightning his raiment white as snow
[1:29:11] and for fear of him the keepers did
[1:29:14] shake and became his dead men
[1:29:16] that takes care of the guards easy to
[1:29:18] get past them
[1:29:20] they're just knocked out the angel
[1:29:23] answered and said to the women
[1:29:25] fiernachi for i know that you seek jesus
[1:29:29] who was crucified now
[1:29:31] that's an interesting way that that
[1:29:32] angel expresses that to these two ladies
[1:29:34] because one believes that he's risen and
[1:29:36] is seen and the other believes that
[1:29:38] that hasn't happened but to say that
[1:29:40] you're looking for jesus who was
[1:29:42] crucified
[1:29:43] is an accurate statement to both of them
[1:29:46] so
[1:29:47] what goes on he's not here
[1:29:53] now he's talking to both of these ladies
[1:29:56] he has risen well now the other mary
[1:29:59] understands that he has risen he has
[1:30:01] risen as he said come
[1:30:03] see the place where the lord lay so he's
[1:30:05] inviting them
[1:30:07] ladies come right on into the tomb here
[1:30:09] you can just come and see for yourself
[1:30:11] come on in and go quickly
[1:30:14] and tell his disciples that he has risen
[1:30:17] from the dead
[1:30:18] and behold he goes before you to galilee
[1:30:20] and you'll see him there i
[1:30:22] i've told you okay now now come on go
[1:30:25] inside
[1:30:25] it's okay go go on now go on now
[1:30:28] we'll pick up the story in mark's
[1:30:30] account and
[1:30:32] entering into the sepulcher undoubtedly
[1:30:35] with some trepidation
[1:30:36] having cautiously accepted the
[1:30:39] invitation of the angel perched on the
[1:30:41] stone
[1:30:42] they saw a young man sitting on the
[1:30:44] right side clothed in a long white
[1:30:46] garment
[1:30:47] and they were affrighted affrighted
[1:30:52] trembling shaking i'd say they were
[1:30:55] scared spitless
[1:30:57] and he said unto them be not a frighted
[1:31:02] you seek jesus of nazareth which was
[1:31:04] crucified he's risen he's not here
[1:31:06] behold the place where they laid him
[1:31:11] but go your way tell his disciples
[1:31:14] and peter that he goeth before you went
[1:31:16] to galilee there you shall see him as he
[1:31:18] said unto you so we have two angel
[1:31:20] witnesses there's one message
[1:31:23] right in the mouth of two or three
[1:31:25] witnesses god abides by his own word
[1:31:28] he's given them two witnesses
[1:31:30] and they went out quickly and fled from
[1:31:33] the sepulcher
[1:31:35] they were running as fast as they could
[1:31:38] for they trembled
[1:31:39] and were amazed neither said anything to
[1:31:42] any man
[1:31:43] for they were afraid god's got a sense
[1:31:46] of humor
[1:31:47] duh they were afraid yeah
[1:31:50] yeah well let's get back now we're
[1:31:54] synchronized here with matthew's gospel
[1:31:57] and they departed quickly from the
[1:31:59] sepulcher with
[1:32:00] fear and great joy
[1:32:04] and did run to bring his disciples word
[1:32:06] oh dear
[1:32:08] you were right mary there are two angels
[1:32:10] here now don't say i told you
[1:32:12] so and as they went through the country
[1:32:16] slowing down as the adrenaline wears off
[1:32:25] maybe stopping to catch their breath
[1:32:27] slowed down to a walk
[1:32:30] mary magdalene has run almost i don't
[1:32:33] know a marathon or something right now
[1:32:35] this lady is tired
[1:32:38] okay so what's going on as they went
[1:32:39] through the countryside and they were
[1:32:41] scared and
[1:32:41] it's one thing for somebody to tell you
[1:32:43] don't be afraid they're holding a knife
[1:32:45] to your throat maybe and saying don't be
[1:32:46] afraid yeah right
[1:32:47] right it's one thing to be told not to
[1:32:49] be afraid it's another to actually
[1:32:52] set your fear aside so they slowed to a
[1:32:55] walk
[1:32:56] hearts pounding palms sweating panting
[1:33:00] gulping air and as they went to tell his
[1:33:04] disciples
[1:33:06] behold jesus met them
[1:33:11] saying all hail hi
[1:33:14] you too right and they came and held
[1:33:18] them by the feet
[1:33:21] and worshiped him now this is the second
[1:33:25] time that mary magdalene has seen jesus
[1:33:27] the first time to me
[1:33:28] now it's okay for her to grab him by the
[1:33:30] ankles
[1:33:33] then said jesus unto them
[1:33:37] be not afraid go
[1:33:40] tell my brethren that they go into
[1:33:42] galilee and there they shall see me
[1:33:44] but the same message that the two angels
[1:33:46] had given them to do
[1:33:48] now now mark we'll get back to mark now
[1:33:51] he tells of this encounter
[1:33:53] with tale but he includes the reaction
[1:33:55] of the disciples to these two ladies
[1:33:57] story
[1:33:58] mark 16 says after that
[1:34:01] he formed two of them as they walked and
[1:34:04] went into the country
[1:34:06] another form they grabbed him by the
[1:34:09] feet
[1:34:10] the first encounter mary magdalene was
[1:34:12] instructed not to touch them
[1:34:14] another form went into the country
[1:34:17] that's a space between the tomb in the
[1:34:18] city the country the countryside
[1:34:21] some people the two people on the road
[1:34:22] to emmaus is what this is referring to
[1:34:26] no no because and they went and told it
[1:34:28] to the residue
[1:34:30] the people that were still gathered
[1:34:33] neither believed they them
[1:34:36] so the pair of the road to emmaus they
[1:34:39] already knew that jesus was risen peter
[1:34:41] had seen him they accepted the report
[1:34:42] they were rejoicing
[1:34:44] this reported these two they're not
[1:34:46] accepting it this is
[1:34:47] mary magdalene and the other mary
[1:34:51] a group of women the group that are
[1:34:53] prepared spices before the sabbath
[1:34:55] mary and mary and solomon purchase
[1:34:57] spices after the sabbath we've got two
[1:34:59] groups here
[1:35:01] and that other group the ones that had
[1:35:03] prepared the the spices ahead of time
[1:35:05] they went to the tomb
[1:35:06] they met two angels they didn't see
[1:35:09] jesus
[1:35:10] they arrived to share their news they
[1:35:12] arrived about the same time that mary
[1:35:14] and mary arrived luke records that mary
[1:35:16] and mary were reporting
[1:35:23] we just read earlier where peter left
[1:35:24] after this report and went down to the
[1:35:26] tomb by himself
[1:35:28] okay while you're taking up a look
[1:35:31] recall the two
[1:35:32] on the road to emmaus we know one is
[1:35:34] collapse
[1:35:35] luke tells us it was reasonable that the
[1:35:38] unidentified companion of columbus was
[1:35:40] his wife
[1:35:42] would he have just left her in jerusalem
[1:35:43] after all this turmoil and stuff and
[1:35:45] he's heading back home and she's back
[1:35:46] there and he's chatting with one of his
[1:35:48] buddies
[1:35:49] possible but why would he why would he
[1:35:51] leave her behind
[1:35:53] i don't know regardless regardless of
[1:35:57] who his companion was
[1:35:58] they both rushed to jerusalem
[1:36:01] and we read they rose up the same hour
[1:36:04] and returned to jerusalem
[1:36:05] and found the eleven gathered together
[1:36:07] then that were with them saying the lord
[1:36:08] has risen indeed
[1:36:09] it appeared to simon so again they got
[1:36:12] to the group
[1:36:14] and the group was already discussing
[1:36:15] that jesus had been risen
[1:36:17] that he had appeared to simon and then
[1:36:19] they got their turn to share
[1:36:22] and they told what things were done in
[1:36:24] the way and how he was known to them in
[1:36:26] breaking of bread
[1:36:27] now we know that thomas left
[1:36:30] somewhere because they came
[1:36:37] testimony jesus himself stood in the
[1:36:40] midst of them
[1:36:42] and saith unto them peace be unto you
[1:36:47] that's when he comes right we read that
[1:36:49] in philippians think on these things
[1:36:51] whatsoever things are
[1:36:52] of a good report true honest that's what
[1:36:55] they were doing
[1:36:57] and he showed up just like he shows up
[1:36:59] here
[1:37:01] just like tonight but they
[1:37:04] were terrified and affrighted
[1:37:08] and supposed they had seen a spirit
[1:37:12] and he said unto them
[1:37:15] maybe he did an eye roll
[1:37:18] why are you troubled why do thoughts
[1:37:21] arise in your hearts you've heard these
[1:37:23] testimonies
[1:37:24] you know that i'm alive hello
[1:37:27] what's up with you people don't you
[1:37:30] believe anything that i told you
[1:37:32] he says behold my hands my feet
[1:37:35] it's me touch me handle me
[1:37:38] spirit doesn't have flesh and bones you
[1:37:41] see that i do
[1:37:43] and when did this spoke and he showed
[1:37:45] them his hands
[1:37:46] and his feet
[1:37:50] well up to now just prior to jesus
[1:37:52] entering this room with these folks
[1:37:54] he's appeared four times four we're told
[1:37:57] is the number associated with man
[1:38:00] to five people five right the number of
[1:38:04] grace
[1:38:04] first he appeared to mary magdalene then
[1:38:06] again to mary magdalene and the other
[1:38:09] mary
[1:38:10] then we're told he appeared to peter at
[1:38:12] some point
[1:38:13] and then there's the two on the road to
[1:38:15] emmaus
[1:38:16] now his fifth appearing even more grace
[1:38:20] to the gathered group the 11 plus others
[1:38:23] except
[1:38:24] thomas left he's not there
[1:38:28] we're told thomas one of the twelve
[1:38:31] called didymus
[1:38:32] we think of doubting thomas did he miss
[1:38:34] doesn't mean doubting didymus means twin
[1:38:37] either he had a a twin brother or sister
[1:38:40] or he was a doppelganger a dead ringer
[1:38:44] for one of the disciples or maybe even
[1:38:46] for jesus himself
[1:38:48] but thomas was not with them when jesus
[1:38:51] came
[1:38:52] the other disciples therefore said unto
[1:38:54] him
[1:38:55] we have seen the lord there's a lot of
[1:38:58] witnesses now
[1:39:00] people that thomas had spent years with
[1:39:02] people that
[1:39:03] he should know how to trust how to
[1:39:06] believe but
[1:39:07] he said unto them except i see in his
[1:39:12] hands the print of the nails and put my
[1:39:14] finger
[1:39:15] into the print of the nails and thrust
[1:39:17] my hand to his side
[1:39:19] i will not believe you guys
[1:39:22] i don't know what's happened i don't
[1:39:24] know what's going on i don't know it's
[1:39:26] got a hold of you
[1:39:27] but you're nuts okay
[1:39:32] so after eight days again
[1:39:35] they're gathered together and thomas was
[1:39:39] with them
[1:39:41] then came jesus the doors being shut
[1:39:45] and stood in the midst and said
[1:39:48] peace be unto you
[1:39:52] then he said to thomas reach hither thy
[1:39:55] finger
[1:39:55] behold my hands reach into the hand
[1:39:57] thrust in my side
[1:40:00] be not faithless
[1:40:03] but believe
[1:40:07] that was enough thomas answered and said
[1:40:10] unto him
[1:40:10] my lord and my god there's no record of
[1:40:14] him actually poking jesus
[1:40:16] he saw it that was enough and jesus said
[1:40:19] thomas because you have seen me
[1:40:23] you've believed blessed are they that
[1:40:26] have not
[1:40:27] seen and yet have believed
[1:40:32] this is jesus calling us who
[1:40:36] have not seen his physical resurrected
[1:40:38] body
[1:40:39] but have accepted the testimony of other
[1:40:42] witnesses
[1:40:44] thomas wouldn't accept those testimonies
[1:40:47] but those of us that have accepted those
[1:40:48] testimonies jesus
[1:40:50] says we're blessed
[1:40:53] why do we believe those testimonies
[1:40:58] because the holy spirit leads us
[1:41:01] into all truth and those testimonies are
[1:41:05] true
[1:41:06] of him who is the truth if the musicians
[1:41:09] would uh
[1:41:10] please come at this time and today
[1:41:14] i've got a challenge for you and a
[1:41:16] challenge for me
[1:41:18] we're in this together right today is
[1:41:21] the anniversary
[1:41:23] of thomas's encounter it's the eighth
[1:41:25] day
[1:41:27] right it was easter a week ago now it's
[1:41:30] the eighth
[1:41:30] day this is this is diddy miss sunday
[1:41:34] right thomas sunday but
[1:41:37] my question do we still harbor doubt
[1:41:42] do we still discount the testimony of
[1:41:44] others
[1:41:45] as thomas did do we only trust our own
[1:41:48] experiences
[1:41:50] just like thomas because
[1:41:54] again to paraphrase brother john andes
[1:41:56] from last week
[1:41:58] it's sunday and pentecost is coming
[1:42:02] it's only 42 more days are you ready
[1:42:07] am i for what brother lyle are you
[1:42:11] making some prediction no no but
[1:42:14] the dynamics came an outpouring of his
[1:42:18] spirit like they'd never experienced
[1:42:20] can't we look forward to the same thing
[1:42:22] don't we have the right to expect if
[1:42:24] that expectation is in our heart
[1:42:27] perhaps god will honor it
[1:42:30] let's return to our roots let's enter
[1:42:32] the book of acts acts 2
[1:42:34] chapter 1 when the day of pentecost was
[1:42:37] fully come they were all with one accord
[1:42:42] in one place
[1:42:45] they were gathered in one place and one
[1:42:48] accord
[1:42:49] both conditions one accord
[1:42:53] brother green has told us that the
[1:42:54] greatest miracle the new testament is
[1:42:56] you get 120 jews in one room and
[1:42:58] agreeing on something
[1:42:59] but but but but one accord look one of
[1:43:02] the disciples was called simon the
[1:43:04] zealot
[1:43:06] what was a zealot this is a political
[1:43:08] term
[1:43:09] the zealots were a violent group
[1:43:11] dedicated to armed rebellion
[1:43:13] to overthrow the yeoman yoke and bring
[1:43:15] about a new jewish kingdom
[1:43:17] think of them as a jewish equivalent of
[1:43:19] isis
[1:43:22] they were out there to wreak havoc to
[1:43:25] tear apart the structure so that the
[1:43:28] messiah could come so that
[1:43:30] the kingdom could be restored
[1:43:33] sitting next to him sitting next to
[1:43:36] simon the zealot
[1:43:38] is matthew collaborator
[1:43:43] a guy who collected taxes for the romans
[1:43:47] from his own people he collected money
[1:43:49] and handed it over to the enemy
[1:43:52] these two guys had enough of the spirit
[1:43:55] of god about them
[1:43:56] that they could sit next to each other
[1:43:58] to the point that they were
[1:44:00] on one accord
[1:44:04] they didn't have to stand toe-to-toe and
[1:44:06] violently disagree and still love each
[1:44:07] other they could finally agree
[1:44:11] matthew and simon who couldn't be more
[1:44:13] different seated together
[1:44:15] verse 15 peter's now addressing the
[1:44:18] crowd he says
[1:44:18] these are not drunken as you suppose
[1:44:22] seeing it's about the third hour of the
[1:44:23] day what third hour of the day about 9
[1:44:25] a.m
[1:44:26] here we're talking about the third hour
[1:44:27] of daylight
[1:44:30] and this is another anniversary because
[1:44:33] what happened
[1:44:34] at the third hour on good friday
[1:44:37] that's when jesus was crucified that's
[1:44:39] when the morning
[1:44:41] sacrifice was made
[1:44:45] these are not drunk these are not
[1:44:47] intoxicated
[1:44:49] what what what happens when a person is
[1:44:51] mildly intoxicated
[1:44:54] it removes their inhibitions the veneer
[1:44:57] is stripped away
[1:44:59] instead of projecting the persona that
[1:45:01] they want you to see
[1:45:02] you begin to see what's really in the
[1:45:04] person
[1:45:07] maybe you see them maybe you see
[1:45:10] the spirit of god in them maybe you see
[1:45:13] some other spirit
[1:45:14] in them right pentecost
[1:45:19] 42 days six weeks
[1:45:23] what is that may the may the 13th or
[1:45:25] something
[1:45:28] i challenge us to be ready
[1:45:31] not to get ready but to be ready be like
[1:45:33] mary magdalene
[1:45:34] believe don't doubt be looking for jesus
[1:45:39] not the legend not the memory
[1:45:43] not the story not your interpretation
[1:45:48] in spite of your uncertainties in spite
[1:45:50] of any hesitations
[1:45:52] in spite of personal risk
[1:45:55] the living christ here in our midst
[1:46:00] be somewhere listening for your name
[1:46:03] like mary

[1:46:08] him
