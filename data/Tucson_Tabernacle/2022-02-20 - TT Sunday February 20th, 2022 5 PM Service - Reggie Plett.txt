to see brother and sister stroke or sister stroke we don't get to hear you all that much up where we're from and i was just wondering if you would have a song that you could bless us with tonight i

forgive me if i mess up [Music] i want to live each day as if the last one i want the truest values in my life for one day it will truly be my last one and i will have to leave this world behind i want to make the most of every moment redeeming to the fullest passing time by putting on his love and bowels of mercy and my grace put on his humbleness of mine each day i come before the god of judgment where i appear for deeds that i have done to give account for idle words i've spoken [Music] and be judged on how i have received his son the days i've wasted are not few but many but i'm praying for a difference in my life till all my friends and loved ones see me changing till they see no longer me but only christ filled me with the holy spirit fill me with eternal life till grace or takes this needy pilgrim and i spread my wings and like an eagle fly fill me with the holy spirit my prayer is please don't pass me by till grace or takes this needy pilgrim and i spread my wings and like any and i spread my wings [Music] thank you i don't know how you feel brother mark but it's such a blessing you know to have a wife who can sing for the glory of the lord i'm certainly thankful i was really admiring that um brother grady's song for us tonight brother grady thank you really appreciated that song and putting those different songs together when i was young i asked my mother why do they always sing about me and dad in church she said what are you talking about well they were singing about i think all of us i said no there's that one song we always sing it's about me and dad why do we sing that song she said well i don't son i don't know what song you're talking about what what song are you talking about i said amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a reg like me and i really thought the word was reg as in reginald which is was our name and and uh you know my mom got a kick out of that but that was truth i didn't know what a wretch was you know as a young boy so i thought it was reg and uh and then i married a grace and uh so i sometimes i feel like calling up her her mom and dad once in a while and and saying you know your grace still amazes me and uh i'm sure i amaze her too sometimes with embarrassing her in church um sure have enjoyed our time down here you know today at lunch uh brother and sister senior dougal were sitting at a booth and after they were finished with their meal together they came over and greeted us and uh sister dougal was just sharing some of her testimony and and just how nice it was at their marriage and their children and i i just it just touched my heart you know it just really touched my heart to see a happy family and um so i just want to say to each and every one of you uh thank you for the invitation and allowing us to feel so at home here uh with you all and if the lord and terry and we'd have more time we'd love to spend just so much more time with each of you but i just want to say thank you um i'm hoping that i can keep this evening as short as well um and i was wondering if you have your bibles if you'd like to just stand with me to honor the reading of the word of god like to turn in the book of deuteronomy chapter 32. and we'll read just two verses uh verses nine and and ten for the lord's portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye i wonder if you just bow your heads for a word of prayer with me precious heavenly father lord we're so grateful to be able to look into these pages and read this word of yours lord we're blessed and god we have probably no excuses in the day and age we live lord for we've been given so much lord abundance of word abundance of the ability to read and lord an abundance of revelation has been delivered god to us in this hour and lord we don't want to take it for granted i was thinking of sister strokhorp's song and god i know that i will have to answer for every idle word and god each of us when we think of that lord it brings a real soberness to us but god we pray that your grace would be sufficient for us as well that lord you would help us instruct us lord every day lord to be a a proper child lord that we would be pleasing to you we thank you god for your love to us and lord this time we have together we want to commit this service to you god we invite you to walk every aisle lord send again that pillar of fire lord to begin to discern every thought and intent of our heart and lord minister to the need that each of us has we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you can be seated i would like to speak about in in desert places tonight and i am certainly not going to probably teach you all much of anything about the desert um and i'm not an eloquent enough speaker i know that we have some ministers here that could far better um are probably have studied into this far in far greater detail so i'm not even going to come close to to uh scratching the surface as to um these desert places and and why why does the bible so many times and so frequently use the pattern of the desert um because we find it in multiple places in the bible and i know that there are ministers who have who could far do a far better job and and there's so much to it so i'm only going to just scratch a little bit and i'll tell you what what inspired this thought was i was at home and we have our devotions in the morning as a family and more times than not it's just my wife and my children and we've um we've started uh listening to a portion of of some of the messages along with our bible reading and prayer and so forth and sister grace will take about 15 minutes and play a portion of a message for the children well for all of us and uh she started i think with the church age book and then she went through the seven seals with the children and now they're going through the hebrew series which i i i've preached so much about that here um between brother dennis and i um but it's such a blessing you you just to hear those tapes playing and then you hear something brother branham says and the way he says it even just really strikes your heart and you say my that was so perfectly put that the the way he even said it is so perfectly said and so of course the the inspiration for what i'm about to say um came from this hebrew series and i'm going to read it for you but of course at the end because i want to i want the anticipation to build here in your hearts and say when's he gonna get to it please um but this the bible does speak a lot about the desert and the wilderness and sometimes i wonder why why why this pattern over and over and what is the significance of the desert and we look at what is a desert what what what what characteristics of the desert do we notice and do we see when we when we look into them not only into the bible but into the message of the hour uh you know brother branham uses a lot of types and shadows throughout his ministry and he said that's just how he preached he didn't have the theological ability according to brother branham to be able to um i don't know what he couldn't do but according to him he you know he just wasn't a theologian he said so i type from i use types and shadows and i'm so thankful for that it makes me to be able to understand what he's what he you know makes the picture very clear to us when we're reading our bible but when we look at the desert we notice certain characteristics of the desert there's a lack of water therefore a lack of life it's very scarce we notice that it's very vast especially uh well you know phoenix the phoenix area between here in phoenix you know that's quite a large span of desert and quite frankly i was shocked to find out that even flagstaff is considered a high high plateau desert and so i suppose the whole southwest when you look at new mexico arizona colorado nevada even into california they're a portion of the way so much desert it's very vast it's a very large area but it's very lonely again because of the lack of water there there's just you don't see a lot of wildlife running through the desert like you would a heavily wooded and watered environment and i have several quotes and and if i'm hoping the brothers can pull this up i'd like to read you uh something brother branham says from ashamed and there's so many uh times brother branham says this very same things he's going to say here but in a different way and he says it multiple times and so you can find this said many different ways from brother branham but he says here well i said i had to come out here and separate myself come to this desert and i thought wonder why god would bring me to a desert out here where there's nothing but scorpions and gila monsters it's not only a desert is it hot but it's spiritually a desert oh my there's no spiritual life at all in the churches they're against why you never seen such in your life we don't even have a church to go to or nothing and then when the people almost perish spiritually i notice it in the people that come out there see the differences in them watching it and so you stay under the spirit of god and your life becomes sweet tender like water brings this grass and soft buds if this grass and arizona wouldn't grow these trees would be cactus them them leaves just wind up and make stickery that's the way it is when you get dry around the church everybody's sticking one another you know and see you got to have soft waters of rain soften you up and make leaves and shade for the pilgrim that passes by find many many places brother branham said out in the desert uh the what it is is there's these stickers and if they would just be uh get receiving the water that that we receive on the east coast why those stickers would open up and they'd be soft leaves and so forth and i'm sure you all know what i'm talking about this is said many a time through the message of the hour and so just looking at this brother branham said i had to come out here and separate myself and that is something that is a pattern we see over and over and over in the scripture is that there is a desire that god desires men and women to get alone with god to separate themselves from the abundance of other people the abundance of other influence the voices that can be here and there and here and there god wants to get you alone so that he can talk to you one on one and he uses a desert as a type there now i don't know about i don't know how you feel but i always as a an as a arizona native when i read something like this and he says it's not only a desert is it hot but it's spiritually a desert it's like ooh well i happen to live in a desert state and i think if we're overly sensitive it'd be easy for us to kind of hang our heads a little bit and say well you know i'm kind of one of those you'll find places where brother branham says that uh the people uh the climate that they live in you'll find that that the characteristics of the people are a lot like the climate they live in if it's real dry the people are real dry and stickery if the p if the place is real cold the people are cold and starchy well i got the worst of all of that not only do i live in the desert southwest but i live up in northern arizona where it gets real cold so i guess i should be hanging my head lower than anybody in this room saying if if the people are like the climate they live in then woe is me but you and i as children of god have got to be able to understand what who brother branham is talking about and what he's talking about when he says this and you've got to be able to when you read the bible no is that speaking of me now or is that speaking of me back then or is that speaking of me in future reference and that's called rightly dividing the word of god and so if you read this and you say well man we live in the desert and it's a spiritually a desert you know there's no spiritual life at all in the churches what churches is brother branham speaking about the churches he's speaking about is a church that is called to the moving of the spirit of god a church who is not living in the full word of god that would be a cold dry dead church now if you say that's not our church well praise god the waters of god are falling upon the church and it's soft keeps you soft and it and it makes you flowery and lovely like the lord jesus would want and and if that's you you can say praise god that's that's us by the grace of god i fit that and and then you're not in you're not wondering oh god is it me am i sticking everybody am i punching at everybody it's rightly dividing the word of god now we want to see that this is these examples these uh these patterns in the bible are patterns for not necessarily physical location but for a spiritual speaking spiritually and we see that god is a god of variety and in 1957 the india trip report brother branham says and god made us all different because he's a god of variety do you believe that he makes big mountains and little mountains and he makes deserts and he makes oceans and he makes white flowers and he makes blue flowers and he makes red flowers and he makes little men big men red-headed black-headed blue-headed he makes yellow brown black men he's a god of variety he's not a sears and robot harmony house he's he's a god of variety see now he makes a variety because that's what he likes i like the way he likes i like it because he likes it and when he's in here you like the things that he likes that's the reason i love nature in its primitive condition so you see brother branham said that he makes mountains he makes deserts he makes oceans and if we were looking at the physical and we were saying well i don't want to be in a place that's desert-like i don't want to live in a spiritually dead condition and we said well is that speaking about tucson is that speaking about arizona well then we'd all need to get up and we'd need to move to some location where there's lots of water there's lots of trees and lots of flowers and lots of mosquitoes and ticks and chiggers and cockroaches and and then we could then maybe we could spiritually type the cockroaches and the mosquitoes as blood suckers and vampires and so on and so forth and and and i don't mean to make light but listen to this next quote from questions and answers number three brother branham says i'm something like abraham was i'm looking for a city see i can't find it but i know it's there but i certainly can't get adjusted to any certain place on this earth it just don't look like find people find places and you go here it's too wet go there it's too dry go up here it's too cold go down there it's too hot see and you there's no place it just ain't home don't want to take up my time crying on your shoulder but see brother branham calls himself uh restless winds and shifting sands you hear him talk about that and he says you know i go here for a little while i go home and you know and and and i feel itchy i gotta go i gotta go preach the gospel somewhere so he says i go overseas and i'm preaching the gospel and i start missing home and i wanna go back home and i see an airplane fly over and i just think i need to get on that i gotta go again that's that restless feeling that every believers got knowing this is not our final destination this is not home for us in this too hot too dry too cold too wet to this condition we're not satisfied with this place we're waiting for this sin condition to be removed from this earth let this earth receive its baptism and then it would be a fit place for a believer but no wonder we feel so restless is this home is this home is this home we don't belong here and i just wanted to i just wanted to get that out there and get that clear because we go through some desert times in our life and the devil would like to get you restless he'd like to get you thinking uh why are you in this dry condition feels like the water's been shut off it feels like things are drying up and is something wrong with your walk with the lord and you begin searching your life and it might be that the lord is desiring a personal audience with you or me he's wanting to get you alone you know brother dennis preaches a beautiful message on grapes and wine and he speaks about the vineyard he says you know when growing grapes they grow them in a real rocky place and they'll let the the vines kind of grow up and they'll really pour the water on them and it'll push all that water to the fruit and it'll get that fruit to where it's real big and plump and juicy and then what they what the vineyard men do the husband they'll cut the water off and what it does is it causes that the fruit to pull all the sugars from the rest of the plant and pull it into the grape and the grape becomes real sweet and sometimes when you when when you see that type how that there's times when god will seemly cut the water off and you think god what is going on i feel so alone i feel so dry and god is desiring to sweeten your life with prayer he's wanting to get you to look to him to get alone with him in prayer so that he can sweeten your life not to just be be grapes but to have that stimulation of revelation to have that wine ability that that ability to create uh like a like wine dozen bottles that expansion that life that fermentation of god in your life it's not me now when we read in the bible and again i realize i'm going through this quickly but i think that everybody will be happier with that in the end when we go home early but we see these characters throughout the bible and the more i began to go through and say how many of these characters do we find god calling into the desert the more i realized there's a lot more than i can i think i could mention but i looked at these characters that god called into the desert and i be i started now i only started with abraham i think we could go back further in fact i think we could look at adam and eve leaving the garden and going into the wilderness but i started with abraham and i thought well certainly abraham was called out into the desert and we can you can read all about that and how that he was there with lot and he said lot take your pick where you would go and what lot saw the well-watered plains of of sodom and gomorrah and that's the direction he went well well abraham stayed up in the high plains and into the desert area and we see god uh speaking to abraham in these desert places while lot living down in the well-watered places seemingly he just rejects the word of god to live in pleasure for a season we know his his soul was vexed and so forth but you see the type then i looked and i thought well if if abraham was i i know of jacob was because i i i had done enough study on jacob but i thought what about isaac and sure enough he also would call isaac out into the desert as well and you can see that when he goes especially to go um he's digging wells because of of droughts so you see isaac out in the desert as well but we look at jacob and jacob being the jacob that he was as soon as he gets in trouble with his brother he flees and he flees to the desert and that's where we find jacob is in a desert place when he's laying down his head upon the stone and god gives him the dream jacob's ladder and and it's in that moment that that and it's such a beautiful thing when you when you listen to brother branham express to us that that ladder that that that jacob was seeing was was christ and how that that ladder was access for men and women to have access to god and it was anchored in jesus christ on earth it was anchored on earth in jesus christ so that we could have access into heaven and and when you read that it's so beautiful it's so marvelous and even when you look into your scripture when he wakes from the dream he builds this altar and god tells jacob look north look south look east and look west and he perfectly draws out the cross and he says remember this place for this is the land that i've given you but it's only through the cross it was only through christ that we had that access it's just it's beautiful and you can read into in into these scriptures and see that that's beautiful but you see him in a desert place we see joseph joseph when his brothers cast him into a pit it was out in the wilderness out in the desert and you can if you go back and you you read these scriptures you see that joseph was in a desert place when he's down in that pit representing christ having to die and and go go into hell for our sins but joseph when he comes out he goes into we we know the story of joseph uh going into egypt and then sitting at the right hand of pharaoh but we see that that desert place was necessary for joseph it was another step into the visions that he had had that had to be fulfilled it was a process that god needed to get joseph through we look at moses and that one's pretty self-explanatory when we see moses who kills an egyptian and goes into the backside of the desert we look at elijah we look at elisha we look at john the baptist we look at jesus jesus after being baptized goes up into the wilderness and is tempted of the devil we see him in this desert place and afterwards after using the word to overcome satan the angels minister to him but we see this time of desert temptation this desert trial in his life and also you can read in many a place where jesus would bring the people out and his disciples out into a desert place he brought the people out in a desert place when he multiplied the fishes in the loaves and the disciples said what are we going to do with these people we've pulled them into a desert place how are we going to feed them send them home and he says go feed them they said we don't have any he says what do you have and that's when he begins to break the fishes in the loaves it's in the desert that you find that god will sustain life in a desert condition you think that's impossible it's so dry there's how are you going to find water how what seems impossible is just an opportunity for god to exercise who he is in 1958 the message time tested faith brother branham says no man has the right to take the pulpit to preach the gospel unless he's had a backside of the desert experience no man no person has the right to call themselves a christian until they've had a backside of the desert experience it's still the backside of the desert we call it upper room but it's still the back side of the desert too it's where you meet god it's so much more pleasant to think upper room because we've got air conditioning we've got electricity today so we think sure upper room sure i'll stay in the upper room for 10 days that'd be a great vacation for a while but what brother branham is showing us here is call it up a room all you want to it's still a backside of the desert experience it's where you and god meet alone it's where all the noise of everything else can be shut out and you are relying upon god to give you an answer because if you stay there too long what could happen oh lions and tigers and bears oh my just let your mind go to work there what could happen if you stayed out there too long this was the upper room experience just go up there and tarry until well until what's that mean one two days three days we don't know well it just so happens we know now it was 10 days but they didn't know 10 days how long does it take for you to get quiet enough how long does it take for you to get to shed the things of the world to shed the noise of work to shed the noise of church to shed the noise of family and and everybody will shed the noise and get alone with god he knows how to do it you think of those children of israel out on the backside of that desert he knows how to shed all those things he knows how to get rid of it but the good news is their feet never swell their clothes never rotted god has a sustaining ability you don't worry god will take care of his end you just get rid of the things you need to get rid of and get alone to talk to god see god provides and he sustains life in the desert i don't know if you've ever seen any of these uh national geographic uh documentaries of the different places of the earth uh they've got all these ones and the arctic and the tropical forests and the oceans and well they also do the desert and it's just amazing to see the different creatures that are in our desert and the way that they sustain life you look at these spiders who are able to create spider webs to collect the dew so that the dew will run down the strings and sustain them with enough water that they could live you look at the toads that live in the desert that dig themselves down deep enough they wait for the rains then they form themselves a bubble and they dig way down in the ground and it maybe not won't rain for years and then as soon as rain shows up again those toads are there and you think where did these toads come from where's moses speaking these things into existence out of but it's because they've sustained life down into the mud they know how to do that god put it within them to do that and it's just amazing how god provides in desert conditions when when you're in a desert place god has got a way that he can give you life hey i i look at abraham who goes out into the wilderness and he and and god just tells him you've got to go you you got to you've got to go and you've got to take your son and you've got to sacrifice him and he goes and he's way out in the wilderness and and then after three days he sees the mountain a long way off and he goes way out there brother brandon said he goes so far out there there's no life out there and he goes up on this hill and his son says father where's the sacrifice he says where's the lamb a son god will provide himself a lamb and brother brahma said there how could there be a ram out there that lions would have eat them up they would have been hunted and killed at that rampant been there in that thicket the whole time but god was jehovah jireh god was able to put a ram there for a sacrifice when he needed a ram there the the story is not for us to see that god can create rams we could just read genesis 1 and see that god's able to create rams but for us to see the faith that abraham had in god that's the point we want to get from the story is that god abraham finally got to a place that he knew god can provide when moses took the children of israel out into the wilderness and the children of israel finally said hey we're free from egypt oh praise god we're free from egypt we're out of that place no more bondage and whips on our backs this is great i'm kind of hungry i'm kind of thirsty hot out here you know i used to be able to go down to the supermarket in goshen and grab myself some food but maybe we didn't think this one through all the way but god was able to sustain them god gave them quail god sent them manna and god gave them a rock of all things he gave them a rock that put out enough water to sustain all those people and all their animals any guests that would like to come visit the camp to hear a good sermon he provided enough water for that he's able to sustain life when elijah brother ed when elijah was called out into the desert that god called him to separate him out into the desert and he found himself underneath a juniper tree god was able to provide sandwiches for elijah and have them delivered from ubereats the crows he sent the crows to feed elijah and then he sent him angels to sustain him as well and then he sent him to a widow woman to sustain him god is able to sustain life in desert places we look at elisha who's sitting in the city and the people are in this desert city and it's so bad they're eating children but elisha gets a word from the lord and says tomorrow we'll be eating the finest flower and we'll be eating these finest cakes and it'll be cheaper than you've ever seen it before and they think that's impossible and then god sends four lepers to go to the enemy's camp to sustain not just the lepers but the city god was able to let the enemies hear the the feet of soldiers coming and let them run in fear so that these four lepers could bring back the good news that god keeps his word and he sustains life in the desert we look at john the baptist who from the time he was a child was called out into the desert called out into the wilderness and here we find john feasting on locust and honey the desert delight but it was molding that elijah character in john it was making him a certain way so that when he could bring the word of god he could use types and shadows of wilderness talk to get the message across to those people in that day and it shook the known world we look at jesus when he calls like i said he calls us multitude out into the desert and he's multiplying fishes and loaves so much so that they're taking up baskets afterwards for the leftovers now i'm getting to this i'm getting to the highlight how about that i'm gonna get i'm gonna read for you what we heard in our devotions that excited me so much and in the end when i ask the question why the desert why does god speak of these desert places and why why can we as children of god relate so well you know god loves to take you into these desert places there's something about it i felt so bad when i married my wife she was from south carolina everything's green vines you know if you spit out the window you grow a tree you know it's just you can't kill grass i don't think you know it's and she came out to arizona and she said yuck it's so brown it's so dry my beautiful south carolinian moistened skin all the time is cracking and i feel like i'm becoming a lizard in arizona and i thought uh uh it is seems a little selfish um but i feel like i don't know how you men feel but to me arizona's ma is man's land it's it's just man's land i don't know what it is every every giant boulder i see i want to go climb it except with brother john and brother peter with ropes but you know there's just something about it's real rugged when you see the mountains even this evening when we pulled up into the church and i looked out and saw the shadows on the mountains i just thought oh man that looks so good i want to be there i want to climb that so bad but it's it's me it's real rugged it's very man-like uh you know it's just what men would like real ruggedness and i think with time i'm you know i have talked to my wife uh from time to time and and she has admitted when we've taken a trip maybe from uh phoenix up to northern arizona we go up by payson and you go up in that area and you see that change from saguaro cactus up into granite boulders and so forth so she's admitted that's it's very beautiful and that's a miracle you know that god could you know either pull the scales off her eyes or maybe just put a lens of man on her eyes i don't know but uh it seems so selfish to me you know as a man i love it i love that that that desert ruggedness and rocks and mountains and so forth and there's something about the desert and and i again i think it would be wrong for me to over spiritualize and say well the prophet came here uh because the prophet went everywhere around the world seven times and like we just read he couldn't find home no matter where he went but to get out alone into the desert i find so many times when i have gone out i think you all remember i think it was the last time i was here i was hunting and i and i went on a desert walk to go hunting i took a long way longer than i thought it was and i brought two bottles of water and that was it and i thought i was gonna die uh i was like marking my spot on my gps so i could send it to my wife the last button i pushed when i died so she could find my body um but i tell you what if you've ever been so thirsty that you say i would drink anything right now i mean you see the filthiest stagnated water and you think i might drink that knowing full well you're going to be sick if you do but you're just when that dryness hits your mouth but what's amazing to me is the amount of times i called on god went on that walk lord i know this is a vast place but you fill all time in space god i need you to get me out of here i need you to get me to water and the idea is that why can't i do that when i'm in the green times the water times why does it take as brother branham say desperation and you hear him say you know i wished it was that way all the time i suppose it's human nature and what a shameful thing for us as human nature in our fallen state that it takes desperation for us sometimes to call on god like we ought to all the time but god knows he knows how to get you to call upon him and to have a discussion with him and i want to read this for you it's from hebrews chapter 3 says god loves to bring you in trouble he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it so he just stopped up the red sea and the first thing you know marched them right out into this place then sent pharaoh after them see how god likes to do it he loves to display his power and love he's god and he just loves to show you who he is amen and the trouble of it is today people say oh them days has passed no how can god display himself when you're taught such stuff as that but god loves to manifest himself here come the children of israel walking in the light moses going on before them there they was come on this is the way god is calling we're going out we're going to the promised land oh hallelujah here they all was shouting and jumping and having a good time you know and the first thing you know they looked back and said oh what's that dust one of them climbed up on a hill said oh oh alas alas it's pharaoh's army god said what you're scared about didn't you believe what i did down there what you worried about why you make me angry when they got down there moses went out and interceded to god god just opened up the red sea and they walked across closed the enemy in that's the way god does it don't get scared don't get all excited don't be frustrated you provoke god then what did he do look like well we had one big trial bless god we god over it we won't have no more we're on our road to the promised land and he led them right out into the desert where there's no water could you imagine god with it with this sanctified holy people led them right out in this trap then got them out of that trap and led them right out here where there's no water when he could have took them some way where there was water why he could just made a river all the way along if he wanted to he could have broke every mountain into joy spurting water 50 feet in the air if you wanted to sure he could but if he'd done that it had been too easy oh i like that blessed be the name of the lord why did god let this happen brother branham so now maybe they're asking him brother branham why did god let this happen why did god god is doing that let him alone just walk on that's god's business the footprints of the righteous are ordered by the lord yes sir what difference does it make lost all my money brother branham well bless god anyhow oh i did this and this happened storm blowed away my house bless god anyhow the lord give the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord just keep walking on it's all the glory of god god knows what he's doing some through the water some through the flood some through deep trial but all through the blood some through the deserts some through the rain forest some through the mountains but really all through the blood that's the way he leads them that's right oh my i feel like i could just stop and scream that's the way he leads his dear children oh can you just feel now i'm not a psychologist but can you just feel that lovely spirit now bathing over the building what if our eyes would come open just now and look what is standing around the sides of these walls up and down these aisles i believe that as a child of god you will go through desert experiences you will go through desert places in your life there is going to be times that it seems the water's been cut off it feels real dry feels real lonely it's very vast feels like where's the end but that's god doing that that's god taking you into that place like he's brought so many others he's got a purpose for it maybe it's to make you sweeter maybe it's to display who he is to you maybe it's to show you that you you think that you're you're capable of providing for your family that you're you've got things under control and he just wants you to know i've got things under control it's me no child of god can call themselves a child of god without a backside of the desert experience how can we call ourselves a christian if we're not like christ and if christ himself went through desert experiences then so us must we and god help us that when we're in a desert time in our life and perhaps you're not perhaps you say oh no um i was in one but i'm out of that now thank god i i'm up on a mountain i can see around well but if you've ever been in one then you know when how to pray how to enter in when somebody else is in one and if you've not been in one get ready you will be you will go through that as a child of god god there are times that god needs to get alone with you as an individual as a husband as a wife as a child as a young person as an old person though you may have been with him time after time he may need an even closer more intimate walk with you than he's ever had before and he may introduce the desert into your life again and when i read this in hebrews chapter 3 brother branham saying this and how that he said god loves to do it i thought well we read earlier if he likes it then i like it the things that he likes i want to like because it's if he's in here and he likes it then i want to like it too and i want to be able to when i'm in a desert moment in my life i want to not be able to say why lord but oh god what have you got for me here lord i want to love this time with you alone and and maybe that means that i've got to say no to some dinner parties maybe that means that i've got to say uh you know i need to go home i need to go get a loan maybe we need to actually go physically get out into the desert and find a rock and find the shady spot and go get alone with god and talk to him but during those times when it seems so dry when it seems so vast and so lonely god help me to say lord i i like it right here to be alone with you god bless you tonight i wonder if we could stand together the musicians would come play something softly i'd like to pray with you and i'd just ask with every head bowed in every eye closed if you're in a desert condition in your life right now you feel very dry like the water's been shut off and you've wondered why or how long is this gonna last and you'd like to just lift your hand to god and say god i'm i'm in a dry time in my life but while i'm in this dry time god would you speak to me personally you'd just like to slip your hand up to him god bless you he chained god bless each of you god sees your hand precious lord [Music] forgive the lord your servant for lord if it wasn't brought out properly or lord as thoroughly as it could have been but lord we all can look into this word and we all hear these words from your servant prophet god our everything within our heart says that's so true that is so true god we can begin to relate to all these different ones that were called into these desert places god we've seen so many times that you've kept your word you have been jehovah jireh lord you've provided so many times for us even in the dry times of our life god there came a time where lord you would open the waters again and you would then begin to refresh us lord we would feel that presence of the lord and be so cool and refreshing [Music] and lord we thank you for that we thank you for being faithful you're a faithful god and lord i want to pray for those that raised their hands tonight and god for those hearts that god were crying out perhaps their hands didn't go up but their heart was crying out god i'm in a dry time of life lord i pray that you would speak to them individually that one-on-one god you would meet them lord perhaps that place would be in their closet lord maybe it'd be in their vehicle might be lord out in the wilderness lord wherever that place would be that you'd like to meet with them i asked lord jesus that your sweet holy spirit would meet them call out to them as you did adam and walk with them in the cool of the evening lord just pour your love out upon them let them know that you are in control that you are that great jehovah eagle that hovers over us lord with those great mighty powerful wings lord jesus the next scripture in deuteronomy is the scripture that as the eagle gathereth her young and fluttereth over them lord god your prophet taught us about the eagle lord god we know you to be a great jehovah eagle we're asking lord that you would once again hover over your sons and your daughters and minister to them we love you lord just pray that god as we're here in this desert land land of arizona that god we would not be those churches that are stickery and punchy at one another but that god in this place in in our church in the church of god in the body of christ lord we would be a lovely plant growing up in your house now lord we would be soft and gentle and lord we would be a shade for a weary pilgrim we would be a place of fellowship where somebody who just needs fellowship could come and gather and refresh themselves in the fellowship of your word and lord help us as sons and daughters of god no matter what church we belong to but knowing that we belong to the church of god lord help us lord to keep that refreshing spirit to keep that water in our churches to keep it in our homes so that your holy spirit can move so gently and so freely that you would have liberty lord to speak to us and to use us god [Music] to help some weary pilgrim granted heavenly father i pray that you would bless each one gathered here tonight that you would go with them to each one's respected homes and to their respected places of worship and god you would bless them abundantly we love you lord we we look for your soon coming lord we long for that day we realize this is not our home we're just a passing through no god we're looking for that we're waiting for you and god we're so thankful for the word that you've given us to sustain us we would just ask all these blessings now in jesus christ's name amen feel my cup lord let's sing it together oh fill my cup i lift it [Music] this thirsting of my soul oh bread of heaven won't you feed me till [Music] and make me hold just one more time as i invite brother aaron to come oh fill my cupboard [Music] of my soul of heaven [Music] is [Music] here's my cup don't keep it in your pocket don't keep it in the cupboard say here's my cup fill it up and make me hope you know sometimes it's not god it's us not letting him do what he wants to do i remember a time his brother reggie talked about being out there with two bottles of water that was a group of us young brothers went out on a hunting trip about 45 minutes out of town not too far on the last day we went friday i think just friday saturday saturday afternoon we out went out one more last time everybody went their own direction and each one of us either had a canteen or a bottle of water and we drank it all we all get back to the campsite and each one of us to ask the other one do you have any water left there was not a drop of water in any one of our canteens or any of our bottles we are 45 minutes from tucson but we felt like we were lost the next time we went hunting we had enough water to put out a forest fire [Music] but i still remember that moment of realizing nobody in the camp had water and we felt so what are we going to do but if we put out our cup and say here's my cup lord there's a song i was looking i remembered and it said springs of living water but right next to it the next song was how long has it been since you talked to the lord i don't know if you have the words to that there brother peter in there how long has it been since you talked to the lord and you told him [Music] how long has it been since you talked with [Music] how long since you prayed how long since [Music] how long [Applause] has since your mind can you call him your friend how long has it been since you knew that he cared for how long has it been since you now buy your bag [Music] how long since you knew [Music] through how long has it been since you woke and fell can you call him your friend how [Music] how long have you put your has it been since you put your cup out and say lord please fill it up you've got it in your pocket you've got it in your shelf you've got it in the cupboard i'm wondering why god haven't you filled it up but you haven't given it to him maybe we just power heads for a moment lord you knew that other song i was looking and right next to her was this song right next to it how many times have we gone to you and said why lord where lord and we might even say lord i walk through that valley and there's just one set of footprints where were you and all this and he said son daughter those were my footprints and i was carrying you i am the living water i am the bread of life i am the breath you take i am your all in all yes sometimes we go looking lord today we got reminded that when you pull us aside you take us somewhere it's because you want that fellowship you want to be able to show and express yourself to us lord how much you cared help us never to walk lord with our cup in our pocket but our cup and our hearts saying here lord fill it up let it be a testimony that lord we know you care even in a desert in a dry land you are the spring of living water thank you for your word and your promise today in jesus christ's day amen the other song i was looking at was i thirsted in the barren land [Music] i thirsted in the barren land of sin and but to the blessed cross of christ one day i came where springs [Music] happy now am i [Music] a wonderful and bountiful surprise it makes me mad and happy all the way [Music] hallelujah [Music] i'm drinking at the springs [Music] a mountain there is flowing deep and wild yes i'm drinking at the springs happy now am i [Music] a wonderful and bountiful surprise the same god they could say tell moses strike that rock and it will give water heat the same yesterday today and for every evening some of the sisters have gone out there was quite a bit of food and things left over from friday evening and they're warming them up now so they'd like if you'd like to come up and have some fellowship over and and partake of the food that was left over and the water that was left over in the drinks and all and some fellowship so if you'd like to do that you're welcome so to think that god cares so much for us and i'm going to say it this way tucson tabernacle okay all from harmony this way how many sermons have we heard right along this line and i know that there is a place where you all brothers go together and you meet you talk what are you preaching what am i going to no no this is all serving the same living god he inspires somebody's heart he shares this and he knows what the need is when god is called and his broader brother out and we think maybe we invited him but god said no i already had that in the plan and i've already given him something to minister and it's been one after another from a juniper tree experience to the different things that just got in here one more time a dry desert somebody else remember brother joe adams he called it ugly desert and those dry saguaros and i heard from some people and they said no that wasn't very nice of him but you know i like going up up to the white mountains and up to flagstaff too and we took a trip to indiana and it's the first time i'd ever been out to the midwest you know never seen so much green in our life that type just we were out there for 10 days came back and this was my wife's words give me my mountains and my brown dirt and i will be happy the rest of my life god knows where to keep his children and put his children amen let's bow our hands lord we thank you lord we would be be ungrateful children if we would say oh not another sermon like that but lord you're dealing with our hearts you're telling us how much you care for us that you're the ever-present water from the rock lord that you can meet the need the spiritual need the financial need the physical need lord there is nothing that's not covered oh lord and not only that but a promise that one of these days and soon lord we'd be leaving this life behind and going to that life that you saw us in with you lord father just a few more days just over the next hill would be home lord what a day that'll be lord bless each one lord bless the food one more time as the sisters are getting it ready lord in the natural lord because we've been given a reminder in a spiritual feeding again today that we can continue to go on drinking of the living water eating of the spiritual manner [Music] that can strengthen us today

name we thank you for it amen thank you brother reggie and your family for coming down and ministering today i know it's it's it's a it's a um effort you know especially when you've got a young family and you've got to get them and bring them and take care of them but i believe the effort you'll receive a blessing from it also amen many appreciated that today amen praise god as as you go out if you would like to it says i'm drinking from the springs of living came from the springs of living water happy now am i my [Music] drinking at the springs of living water [Music] yes i'm drinking at the
