this church uh was over in in on Vancouver Island with some friends and one of one one of these friends was a man who was a pastor's son who had grown up in church all his life and had seen the spirit of God move he had seen people healed had seen people saved but they were walking down this street in uh in Victoria British Columbia and he turned and he said you know what I don't know that I've ever met him and his brother Tom he said you can meet him right now and right there on that street corner they knelt down busy street corner cars people walking by they knelt down right there and that man received the baptism of the Holy Ghost on that street corner Cor in Victoria British Columbia I felt to share this because if you want the Holy Ghost you can have it right now if you want salvation you can have it right now there's people at the back that can pray for you there's people up here but you don't even need that right where you're at you can be filled with the Holy Ghost right now do you believe it do you believe that let's stand to our feet let's sing this the Lord can do it for you and you can look back and say that Father's Day 2024 at that old church building on Stone he filled me with the Holy Ghost you believe it let's sing this song when I think about the Lord how he saved me how he raised me how he filled me with the Holy Ghost how heal yield me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up and turned me around how he placed my feet on Solid Ground let's sing that one more time when I think when I think about the Lord how he Sav me how he raised me how he fill F me with the Holy Ghost how he healed me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up and turned me around place my feet on Solid Ground it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus oh Lord you're worthy of all of the glory all of the honor and all of the praise it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy all of the glory all of the honor and all of the praise when I think about the Lord when I think about the Lord how he Sav me how he raised me how he filled me with the Holy Ghost how he healed me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up and turned me around how he placed my feet on Solid Ground it makes me wonder to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy of all the glory all of the honor all the praise it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord your worthy all of the glory all of the honor and all of the praise can you say hallelujah can you

God bless you welcome it's good it's good to have you and all the other visitors welcome we're grateful as always when um we have loved ones that come into the house of the Lord and worship our lord Jesus with us I um I was talking with uh the the pool the um guys were working on my house in the backyard the other day and I was uh I went out there and I started talking to one of the kids that was he was in his 20s um that was working on the on in the Landscaping in the backyard and he said um I uh I said so you know what do you do is this is your job he says yeah he says uh he says well he says um I said do you have a pool because they were building the pool in my house I said do you have a pool and he said he says no he says um I moved out uh a little while ago he says I got started and he said then I ran into some problems and the girl I was with we split up and he said um he said but then he says you know he says it was good I moov back at home with Mom and Dad and first of all I told him it's good that you have a mom and dad to move back in with he should be thankful for that and he says yeah he says I was I moved back in with Mom and Dad and he says you know he says I just I I needed it and he says you know I just started praying and uh I said wow you I thought in my heart wow that's not common for somebody to say something like that' and he says ' yeah and he says ' then he says I started going back to church and he said 'you know it was it was all best I said I responded so so you go to church huh and he said he says yeah he says I do um and uh I said uh well I said I'm a pastor and he said I knew it he said there was something about you he said it was just you can he says you can feel that presence when you when you come into contact with someone else that believes the Lord Jesus and I must admit I felt the same about him he was he was just you know he's out there working and I I said there's just something special about this young man and I wanted to go out and I wanted to talk to him so he was he was out there and we we just had a really nice conversation and and his colleagues were getting mad at him because he wasn't working I was like hey man I'm the boss I'm paying the bills kid can do what I tell him to so anyways it was it was a really it was a nice time but it's important brothers and sisters we recognize that there is a spirit about a Christian and it's not our spirit all of us have our own individual Spirits we all have flaws and and things with our personalities but when we actually receive God's spirit it has nothing to do with us it's not by our own Merit it's not because we're special it has nothing to do with us it's all him and if we can just portray that Spirit to the world then we will be successful I was uh talking with a friend of mine I I go to Yuma every once in a while and uh a friend of mine who is he's listening in now he's considers himself part of this church him and his wife they and they as I said they live in the Yuma area and we had dinner and he was is telling me that this testimony of this man that he had met he's a Catholic man and uh the man had a stroke and he said that he frustrates people because he he has a tough time getting words out and he he can't like have a normal commun communication you have to be patient with him and he says you know he says he comes by and he comes by all the time now he he rides his bike and he he'll be like hey James and and then um James will say hey come on in and and they'll come in and they'll have this nice conversation and he says he says he's really found the Lord since he has had this stroke his wife left him because now there's no use for him really he can't make a living he can't he can't provide for the family so she went on to uh what she probably considers better things well this man went to God and he as I said he rides by and his bike so he comes in and visits brother James and brother James says that we have the nicest conversations and and the man apologizes I know I take a a long time to get stuff out and brother James's attitude is like hey I'm retired I got all day long just keep talking and he said he told me and tears came to his eyes eyes and he says you know he says I can't remember things brother Daniel he says that I can't remember the scriptures like you can remember them and he says I guess it's just that I'm not very smart or something and he says but I wish that I could be a good influence on this man I wish I I wish I could be a a witness to him I wish I could just take the Bible and and just open it up and go from scripture to scripture like you can and and present it to this this man he says I just but I just fail and big tears were in his eyes and I said brother James what are you talking about I said how do you think it would go with this man if I walked up with my Bible and I said now listen I want to show you some scriptures and how you are wrong and explain to you about what you're believing and how and how that it is flawed I said how would that go with this man and he says well I don't know I said God has placed you there because you have something that is beyond any type of Theologian how somebody could dig into the Bible and explain these things I said what you have presented to this man and why he loves you so much is because you are showing love to him and love is so rare today and this man just loves brother James he's always coming by and brother James says well yeah I mean he he goes to church every single day and and I said brother James let me ask you this okay he's Catholic okay do you want to change him he goes to church every day he loves the Lord that much he's that serious about it and you want to get this man to maybe stop doing that and he says no I said that's what you're asking for no you need to just show him love and be a witness to him and you are both brothers you are Christians you love the Lord Jesus and that's why you are successful and if I went to the same man I wouldn't be successful God placed you there my friend and you are you are doing it you're helping this man but do you see how the enemy attacks them have compassion on them love them you understand remember we've been going through the book of Hebrews he is a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he has been tempted in every way the Bible says yet without sin so he has felt all of these problems that we feel he's felt all of these Temptations all of these angers everything the enemy hit him with everything that the enemy has and yet he didn't sin but he did it he chose to do it so he would understand what we go through what a wonderful wonderful father if I I never want to go through those things because they make you miserable I remember one time I was living in Jeffersonville I um I was doing some landscaping and I picked up this big rock and man I hurt my back and I've always had a good strong back and it torqued it and I couldn't breathe for days it was just hurting really bad and and I remember laying there in such pain and I couldn't move I remember thinking that this is how people with chronic back pain feel every day and the Lord allowed me to experience that now we may not understand how things are we we might not understand when people have different weaknesses that are are ours but God does understand it a loving father really understands what his children go through and he could not have done it he was the he was the all knowing all he was the Eternal God he created the heavens and the Earth he did all of these things but then he lowered himself to a man and not just a man he lowered himself to a flesh and blood man that got old that had back pain that had all of these different feelings attacking him so he would understand what he what we all go through and yet he did it without sin showing us that we can overcome I um uh a friend of mine um when I was in Yuma um a brother that I work with um down there he's I spent the day with him and he's leaving so um I wanted to get some get some time with him and he was telling me of a camp that his wife and his daughter went to and it was kind of a Coming of Age camp for the young ladies and he told me that they were teaching them about living right and about how to how to just how to just be a good Christian and and one of the things was the fathers would write a letter to the daughters and warn them about some of the perils mainly was Immortal living and that was kind of the focus and the daughters or the the dads would wrote the daughters a letter for them to open up when they were at the camp and he said he goes he goes Dan he goes man this is this is rough write my daughter about this stuff and and he said what I wrote to her was that young men they they will deceive you many times to get what they want and you know what I'm speaking about and I said I said bro I said you know isn't that sad I said isn't it sad that you have to write your daughter a letter warning her about these things when it should be the young man that is stronger when it should be the young man that has a closer walk with the Lord when it should be that young man who is worshiping more because the Bible very plainly teaches that the man is the stronger vessel it should be the young man that leads but instead we live in a society right now that teach teaches us weakness and it teaches us immorality and it it teaches us that no you don't have to live a moral life and it's just what it is is it's the lack of dads in the world today and it's even going farther where the the the fathers are pulled out of the family and they don't have that influence that they should on the children children sister Amilia um I Heard the the testimony that brother Josiah read that um so sister Amelia called me and she needed some help with her car yesterday so I um I drove out there and I I looked at the car and the battery was dead so I put the jumper cables on it which she told me that somebody else a kind soul had stopped and helped her and the car started and I put the jumper cables on it started running then I took the jumper cables off and the car stopped and and I told sister amilio it's your alternator um because the um the car should should be generating power even if the battery's dead when uh when that alternator is running so your alternator is bad and and after we got sister milia um back up and going I was driving home last night and I was thinking about Father's Day and I was thinking Lord the reason I know that is because my dad my dad taught me these things my dad helped me work in my my cars my dad was always in my life and he uh he taught me how to fix things he taught me from everything from vehicles to I mean how I know how to drive a scraper and a back ho you know the big giant Earth movers my dad taught me how a drive on how many people can say that how many pastors know how to drive a scraper put that on my my resume um but I know how to do it because my dad taught me and the most important thing my dad taught me he taught me a good work ethic and I do I just appreciate him so much he wasn't my dad wasn't someone that that had a real deep understanding maybe of the Bible he didn't read his Bible very much but what he did do is he listened to tape sermon all the time and he he just he loved those sermons and then he just love to talk with me about it talk with me about brother brandom would say this or or that and he wanted to discuss these things and then and With Me growing up I heard all the time these stories my my dad my my dad's family in 1950 they were listening to the radio in south Georgia and this man was preaching on the radio broadcast and my grandpa Welch Evans he's listening he's like man I like what this guy's saying so he got all the kids together after it was over they said he's gonna they're going to be up in I believe it was Cleveland Tennessee and so that night so my grandpa got all the kids together and took the car and they took off North about five or six hours to Southern Tennessee to hear this man so they started listening to him and following him around the country and the first time they went to William bram's home base which was in Jeffersonville they drive up there they hear that he's going to be in Jeffersonville they drive up there and they get to the town and that's all that they knew they didn't have Google Apple Maps they didn't have any of that it's so strange today but they didn't have it they arrived in this good siiz town and they're like okay well uh where do we go now because we're going to go to these meetings so they see this lady going into this grocery store and remember what I said about the pool guy the uh the construction guy in my backyard my grandpa said he says she looks like a Christian he said my grandma's name is Cle he said CLE go talk to her and see if she's ever heard of William Brandon so my grandma gets out of the car and she goes over and she sees this this um older sister and she says older lady and she says um ma'am she says uh we're here from down south Georgia she said would you know a man named William brandom and she says uh yeah um he's he's a preacher oh she says oh yeah she's well I I think so um my son's name is Bill brandom and he's a minister and she says my grandma says good she invited our family over she made my family a meal they stayed with her and then they went to to those meetings that night they went to that service that night my dad and all the family they had seen the Holy Spirit moving around in the audiences and people coming up to the platform and they would be healed of diseases like cancer or or deformities in wheelchairs coming up and they had seen these things in the short time that they had been following this man and there was a problem in my dad's family and that was his little brother named Jimmy had cross eyed cross eyes couldn't see the eyes were were were locked crossed my dad was sitting in the front in in Jeffersonville sitting in one of the chairs in Jeffersonville and he was praying towards the end of the service the pastor the the minister Prophet had people bow their heads and he and my my dad bowed his head and he was praying for his little brother saying Lord healed Jimmy's eyes had a burden for his brother but what he didn't know is the man in the Pulpit had an experience decades earlier where his daughter his little infant daughter was dying and was in so so much pain as the father would look over her his his wife had just died and now he's looking at his daughter and she is in so much pain that her little eyes would cross from the pain and it just ripped his heart out of him and he looked down and and seeing his his little baby in so much pain and shaking and then she ended up dying and it made an impression such an impression on this Minister that anytime time someone would come to the platform with crossed eyes that same thought would come to this man and it be gave so much compassion that God honored it and every single time that that person would be healed of those crossed eyes my dad didn't know that but there he is in in the audience and he's praying Lord please heal my brother of his crossed eyes at the end of the prayer the Minister William Brandon says amen my dad's eyes were still closed praying for his brother he looked up the minister was looking at him and he said Son God has heard your prayers for your brother he's going to be fine amen and he was healed that moment that young man was healed of his cross eyes they went back well now God doesn't we always think well I've heard this saying before saying God doesn't do do things halfway God does things his way the young man his eyes weren't crossed anymore but he still wore glasses you know for for the rest of the time that he lived he ended up dying in a auto accident but he was healed right then and it was because of the burden of his brother my dad praying for him and just loving him and that's the burden brothers and sisters we think of that love we think of a little baby dying and what if it was my baby let me tell you something the father Our Father the one that brother Lyall recognized earlier and said Happy Father's Day He has more of a burden for us than we do for that baby maybe even if it's ours we don't understand how much God the Father how much his love is for us and we on Earth us men and you young men please listen to me closely we have a great responsibility in raising our children we represent the Father Figure to not only our children but our wives we must represent God in that same loving compassion that the same God that healed the young man of his eyes would be in us I read these statistics last year and I added a couple I think I'm going to read them again because Unfortunately they haven't changed Father's Day is the lowest attended church day of the year Mother's Day is the third highest next to Easter and Christmas um Sean McConnell director of LifeWay research says this clearly mothers want to be present for the affirmation that is typically offered in most churches but families also are present knowing their attendance will honor their mother the attendance difference between Mother's Day and Father's Day is telling either churches are less effective in affirming fathers or families believe Christ Christian fathers don't value their participation in worship services for new converts a survey found that if a child is the first person in the household to become a Christian there is a three and a half% probability that everyone else in the household will follow if the mother is the first to become a Christian there's a 177% probability that everyone in else in the household will follow however when the father is first there is a 93% possibility probability that everyone else in the household will father follow wow so if Dad gives his heart to the Lord Jesus look what happens to the family 177% for the mother 93% for the father a father who regularly attends service even if the mother does not 66% of the children will attend church when they become adults that's a good stat you're building something in your family when both parents attend church 75% of children will become regular worshiper worshippers so if Mom and Dad both are attending church 75% of our children will continue on after they are on their own what's the first thing I thought of when I read that what about the other 25% that's what made me feel that it's like wow that's supposed to be a good thing but we lost 25% even in the best best case scenario the following is true from a fatherless home 63% of suicides come from fatherless homes 71% of high school dropouts come from fatherless homes 75% of Youth in chemical abuse centers come from fatherless homes 80% of rapists come from fatherless homes 85% of all children with behavior disorders come from fatherless homes this one hits hard this next one because we see it a lot here 90% of homeless and runaway children come from fatherless homes I can say that I've seen that how many times have I witnessed to people in this neighborhood and homeless people all around and many of these homeless people I always say how did you get here and where is your family and many of them say well my mom is in prison or or yeah yeah my mom's worried about me or I talk with my mom but they almost never mention their dad it's because Dad's almost never there most of them that I talk to don't even know who don't even know their dad have no idea where he's at if you don't have a father in your life you are four times more likely to go into poverty you're twice as likely to suffer obesity girls are seven times seven times more likely to get pregnant out of woodlock as a te I'm sorry as a teen without a father in their home focus on the family I found this stat that positive father care this is this is in a book by Dr puit positive father care is associated with more pro-social and positive moral behavior in boys and girls this comes from research from the University of Pennsylvania which indicates that children who feel a closeness and warmth with their father are twice as likely to enter College 75% less likely to have children while they're in their teens as I just mened mentioned 80% less likely to be incarcerated and half is likely to show signs of depression just if there's a dad at home in the 26 year yearlong study researchers found that the number one factor in developing empathy in children was father involvement number one father spending regular time alone with their children translated into children who become more passionate adults James chapter 1: 27 says pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world we all know we've heard about the widows and helping the widows but what about those that don't have a dad how much can we do for those people and how much would it help our congregation how much would it help the people that just are everywhere it doesn't say just a Christian here it says to visit these people to help them if you don't have children or if your children are older I'm sure that there are people that young people that could really use your wisdom and the fathers they're so influential because we are made in God's image so many of the attributes that we have they first started in heaven in God and then he passed them down to us we've all heard of the Redemptive names of Jehovah this is how there is redemption made this is how we are redeemed there are seven Redemptive names in the Old Testament the first one Jehovah righ the Lord is my shepherd you've heard Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want Jehovah gyri the Lord is my provider Jehovah RI the Lord my healer Jehovah Shalom the Lord my peace I remember one time with with my um I was like 16 years old and and I let a friend drive my car and he he wrecked the front panel of it and man I loved my car I was devastated and I didn't know what to do I was a kid and I came home I was like Dad I just messed up I shouldn't have let him drive and and you know my dad did we didn't have the money really to to to have it done right to put it in a in a shop but me and my dad we unbolted the quarter panel of the car we bought a new panel we put it on there we had it sprayed and I my car wasn't wrecked anymore he gave me such peace I always knew Dad could handle it that I could take care of things Jehovah RI the Lord is my healer Jehovah Shalom the Lord my peace Jehovah n the Lord my banner Jehovah said kenu the Lord my righteousness and the one the last one I want to mention number seven is Jehovah shama the Lord is there for me how beautiful brother how many times has been there for us to in the past couple weeks we have sister Grace here the Lord took care of her she was she was in the hospital and we were praying for you the Lord took care of it the Lord was there for you he's there for me he's there for all of us and that is how a Dad should be amen we should always be there for our families we should always be there for our children remember brother Jordan and I were uh were talking with a brother um I think it was right Before Christmas out in the parking lot and he was talking about how all of these retired folks or or um folks that can't uh work anymore how that they don't have a relationship with their children and how their children don't help them like it used to be in previous generations where you would move your your family in and you'd all take care of each other and there was this great family bond but now we don't see anymore especially here in the United States and the brother was telling brother Jordan and I he said I we all think that it's because of this derel generation this disrespectful generation but the brother told us he says I don't think it's that way he said I think it's because the parents didn't give the kids enough time that they didn't invest in their families that they didn't give the kids the time that they needed if you remember from our Wednesday night bible study I'd like to turn in our Bibles to Deuteronomy chapter 6 I read it at the beginning in our Bible study we we as we've gone through and the next one in a few weeks will be Song of Solomon but when we got to Deuteronomy we learned that that book is a series of sermons by the prophet Moses and what it was is Moses was old everybody that was in that generation that came out of Egypt they had all passed away they had all died out in the wilderness when they were wandering around for 40 years and then Moses takes them right up to the edge of this promised land that was given to their ancestor Abraham and that had come all the way down and was given to them and it they were about to go over into this Promised Land This Modern Day Israel you hear the Palestinians talking about from The River To The Sea this is that land that God himself promised to the Jews and it goes way back Beyond 100 years goes like 5,000 years ago and this land that was promised to them a land that was flowing with milk and honey they came here and now Moses is old Joshua was old there there there's just a couple in Caleb's old there's just a few left and they're about to go over into the promised land and Moses is getting from God this message to the people and what it is is it's a history of what has happened the book of Deuteronomy isn't necessarily anything new it was already chronicled in Exodus and numbers but Deuteronomy is saying God telling the people here's what happened and remember let's read chapter let's read verse one Deuteronomy 6 verse one now these are the Commandments the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you that you might do them in the land whether you go to possess it this is a father telling his children that listen you're about to get out on your own there's no more Mana going to fall there's no more water coming out of the rock there's no more quailes going through the camp you are going to be out out on your own there's no more food in the refrigerator if you don't pay the light bill it's going to get shut off now you're on your own son you're on your own daughter you're going to be going into this new land and he's preparing them for that and I also want to mention too I told a testimony earlier a couple testimonies I want to point out very plainly that these people in Deuteronomy that none of them witnessed what I'm about to read except for Moses Joshua Caleb it's just amazing what he says verse number one again now these are the Commandments and the statutes and the judgments which your lord God commanded to teach you that you might do them in the land whether you go to possess it he promised many things brothers and sisters and and what did what had happened is the people had chosen sister Shirley I believe it as you and I that were talking about this the people had chosen they got afraid when God started to speak on the mountain and the people had chosen that no we're afraid for God to speak we want Moses to speak instead of God because if God is speaking we're going to die because they saw all these problems in their lives so we would rather have Moses speak imagine if you're a father imagine how that would make you feel if your kids would say no um actually you live to half of a life for me dad so I'd rather just have someone else speak for you imagine how that would feel you think God doesn't have feelings that's what they said so here we see that that the people had chosen for a man to speak to them instead of God and then we go all the way to the New Testament in the book of Hebrews and we can see why it was so great great that Paul or whoever the author was writing to the Hebrew audience he said in Hebrews chapter 1 he said God who had Sund Dr times and in diverse manners God who in old times and in many ways spoke in time past by the prophets because you chose it he spoken time past by the prophets hath in these last days spoken by his son so now God gave us another opportunity to hear him speak himself directly to us through the Holy Spirit and through his son Jesus Christ what a great honor it doesn't take prophets out of the picture by no means god uses prophets God uses prophets to bring a message to to to bring warning to the people he he uses ministers he uses churches he uses Apostles he uses these things but now because of Jesus Christ we don't understand how great it is that we can have a relationship now with God that we couldn't have had before and now we get to talk to the father ourselves and it doesn't have to go through a high priest it doesn't have to go through anyone else I can get on my knees and I can cry out to God the father and he will hear me it doesn't need an Aton I don't have to go to the high priest and have him kill a goat for me now I can talk to him and say Lord I'm pourn out my life to you I need help and because of Jesus Christ that atonement we can talk to him directly brothers and sisters one of the it's one of the greatest scriptures I know in the entire Bible Hebrews chapter 1 God who had Sun drry Times and divers manner spaking times passed by the prophets asked in this last day by his son it's wonderful I get to talk to God can you imagine can you imagine actually talking to God himself and then having him talk back oh I I just it's beyond even thinking that the Father the the Creator the Eternal God that we can get down and we can actually have a conversation with him the apost the the the author of Hebrews said it that's why he died on the cross that's why we had the sacrificial lamb or the whatever it sacrificial lamb in the Garden of Eden and then with Abel they sacrificed animals and all of this came all the way down to Jesus Christ and he was the perfect sacrifice and now we can have a relationship with him it's everything I don't think we even understand how great how great this cross is like light's not on it's not plugged in he didn't have a light on his cross either he was the light he was the shikina glory he was he was he was everything and because of him we can speak to the father brothers and sisters it's all about Christ sir I better get going haven't even got to my scriptures yet let's go back to um Deuteronomy 6 that thou mayest fear the lord thy God and keep all his statutes and all his Commandments which I commanded thee thou and thy son and thy son's son all the days of thy life that thy days may be prolonged he's saying that pass this on to our children and our children's children and you will benefit from it I'm not just talking about spiritually you'll benefit from this life here therefore Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee that thou may increase mightily as the Lord go Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land flowing with milk and honey he's saying there that if you keep the Commandments of God when you have a family when you're on your own whatever it might be then you will prosper Jesus said that if you prefer your brother over yourself he told he told us to do that Jesus said to serve others Jesus said when someone says something against you to forgive them Jesus told these things and if we would really apply those you young people looking for careers if we would really apply that to our lives people would want to hire us we'll be a better employee am I right brother Tony the people we work with there's people that you like to work with it's because they're not always serving themselves they're not all about themselves they're not selfish people and those are the people that Prosper this is just Basics right here this is going to help you whether you're a Christian or not if you live this Christian life you are going to do better and when we give this time when we study but the line the time that we spend in in reading our Bibles the the time that we study the time in in prayer that's an investment it's an investment in our careers it's an investment more importantly in our families in our children Proverbs 13:22 says a a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children it's amazing that I can leave an inheritance not only to Daniel and meline but I can leave an inheritance to my grandchildren and you know what I want my inheritance to be yeah I would like to leave them something monetarily but I want to leave them that my dad loved the Lord and he taught me to love the Lord he taught me a good work ethic he taught me to respect he taught me to to to respect others to to to be successful and then I want to teach it to my son my daughter and I want them to teach that that is the inheritance that's the greatest inheritance that they might receive the same holy spirit that I have that they might receive they might have the same love for Jesus Christ that I have that's the inheritance I want to leave for my children verse number four we read it at the beginning here o Israel the Lord our God is one brothers and sisters that's why baptism it's it's important that we recognize God in all things and we talk about being baptized and there's of often the question why would I want to be baptized if God has done something for you and you see I have my salvation but there's something else above your salvation now that you you have your salvation there's a Thanksgiving that you give to God and you want to go into the Waters of baptism and say Lord now you have done this for me now here I stand in this pool of water and I am taking on the name of Christ to where I can be a Christian so often we see baptism in the names of the fathers the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit there's not a name associated with that and it's so easy when we are baptized in that way to be baptized into a church or into a denomination because there's no name associated with it now I am baptized into this church yeah I started attending that church and I got baptized now I'm part of that church no that is why it's so wrong you have to be you have to take on a name there's no name in those baptisms but I want to be associated with Christ I am a Christian I want Christ associated with my name therefore I am baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you can go to this church or that church or wherever it doesn't matter but what matters is that you have accepted Christ it is vitally important to set your name with his name otherwise it just doesn't mean as much I believe it it means something it means that there's a burden there to be baptized but when you're actually getting up in the water and saying I am taking on the name of Jesus Christ there is a change in my life now I want to change and I am showing all of the people here present that I take on the name of Christ I'm a different person not in titles not to a church but to the one true God where was I he what verse five okay and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might Jesus himself quoted this scripture as being the greatest commandment I'll break it down and then I'll just stop when I run out of time love him with all your heart the Bible seems many times it's strange it it interchanges mind and heart it seems like when there's something that means a little bit more when there's a deeper understanding when there's a deeper meaning that the Bible says heart Proverbs says as a man thinks in his heart so is he so your thoughts and my thoughts brothers and sisters they Define us remember when I was walking I was all these problems were going through my mind and and I was I I was struggling that defines who I am I don't want that to Define me I want the spirit of Christ to Define me I want it in my heart I want those things to come out love him with all your heart and with all your soul our soul is eternal it came from God and it goes to God the father's telling us to love him with a deeper love an eternal love but between the father and his child if we're going to be eternally with God in heaven then we need to have that love deep in our souls that Eternal agape love and with all your might so with all of your heart with all of your soul and now we have something to do we have to put it into action this is an action here with all of your might as I was talking about to be baptized that's something that's important and to the men if we love the Lord with all of our hearts and with all of our minds and all of our souls then we need to represent the Lord to our children to our families and teach them about these things as as the Lord commanded here in Deuteronomy remember when Daniel and meline when they're babies when they're little the best time of the day really for our family was bedtime how many can say that we would sit there and and the kids would would be excited and and I'd have the Bible book you know the little kids Bible book and I'd sit down and and my babies would sit next to me and we'd open it up and we would read just chapter after chapter I'm talking about the little picture Bibles you know with with the the short words and they tell little stories and here I am reading in the kids are just locked on and they just they just loved it it was so it was just such a good thing and let me tell you something I didn't go to Seminary school I'll tell you my secret that's how I learned the Bible I learned it very well in those little bible stories and then I would go and and read them in the big book The Mom and Daddy book but the little one we would we would be I'd be I'd be telling them those stories and they were just locked on one after the other building this Foundation of my children and then I remember with u with meline I'd let the kids watch some DVDs like some Christian DVDs and and meline would always say Daddy um daddy I gotta go potty pause it and I'd be like no we'll just said no Daddy no Daddy just pause it okay so she'd go and come back and jump back on me and I'm I'm I'm reading and then I'd always do the same thing buddy do you remember when I would close the Bible I would get to the end of a story and I would take the little Bible book and I would do that and those little guys were so fast inevitably and meline was faster than Daniel inevitably I would be in the process slow motion of closing that book I was going full speed and my little girl could slip her hand in there and stop the closing of the Bible and she just one more Daddy just a little bit more building brothers and sisters building that relationship with with my family I have I'll um I'll finish with my notes I got halfway through that's good enough um but with brothers and sisters with raising our children we have to be that Dad to our sons like my dad was to me and teaching me how to drive the heavy equipment and having how to fix a car and talking about the Lord and sharing these testimonies with me and then and then even to the right before dad passed away he just loved me coming over and he'd always say bud I I heard this you know the Bible says what what does this mean and we would just talk about the Lord and and talk about the the meaning of the word and then I pass that I want to pass that on I hope I passed it on to my son and in in putting the word first and and him loving the word like he does and look at my son and how we're together every day we talk every day we love each other it's because he trusts me and I trust him and our daughters we don't want to ever forget our daughters Brothers let me tell you this if you are not that manly fatherly figure to your daughter she will find someone else that is and you won't want that it'll be bad for her and it just cause her problems over the years love your daughters when my daughter she one time she was teenagers they all go through they lose their minds from age 14 to about age 21 there but to have a parent that loves them there and takes care of them in that time and when my daughter she was going through a hard time and and she had lost her mind and she was I had a full head of hair before my before my daughter was a teenager not really um but I did age quite a bit but she trusted me and when she needed dad to lay down the law I did and she trusted me and she loved me but I saw that I need to replace place I need to be that person that she is needing right now so my daughter and I every few weeks we set a date that we would go out to dinner just her and me and just have that fellowship with a father and a daughter and she would tell me things and and we would talk and and and we we would dress up and we'd go out to a nice restaurant and she'd always pick she'd be like Daddy I want to go to to this place this time and and that place and it was something that we both just really looked forward to but I had to take the time to do it dads I don't care if you're 80 years old if you have children take the time now to spend with them they may be 50 years old but it's time you can do more spend time with your kids and then you'll find that that Legacy starts trickling down to your grandkids and your great grandkids it's worth our time be a good dad set a good example be that representation of the father to your children and to your spouse and let me tell you it's an investment the Bible says very plainly so that things will be good and they will be good your kids will do better financially your kids will do better relationship wise everything will be better and it's never too late I promise you the musicians would come I didn't uh I didn't get through my notes but it's on my heart I want to read one scripture um it's in first John chapter 2 I believe I think it's in first it is first John chapter 2 and and this as I was ministering this just came it came to my my mind and it's really a message from a father now John was probably he's writing to these disciples that he led them to the Lord and he was a father figure to them but listen to these beautiful words he says this I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake I could stop right there and we could Rejoice for the rest of our lives right there I Rite unto you you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write to you young men because you have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because you have known the father look at the relationship talk about Father's Day look at the relationship between the children and the father I have written unto you [Music] fathers because you have have known him that is from the beginning I written unto you you young men because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the wicked one why are they strong C why are they strong man it's because they have the word in them and when you have the word in you you can do all things it needs to be taught Church happens a couple times a week but we should have church every day even if it's just a little coloring book or a picture book talk about the Lord with your children not just the Lord talk about everything with your children think about them take the time if you want to return on your investment you have to invest verse number 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him me ministering this morning one thing I want to tell you I can say this before for the Lord Jesus Christ I have fallen short in just about everything that I said in my life and in my being a dad I wish I would have done more I wish I would have spent more [Music] time but what time I did spend God honored it it's that every night devotions with my kids it's that that time that I spent taking them on vacation it's that time that that we spent just being a family making my poor daughter go for a walk and she hated it she complained but she doesn't complain anymore she loves her daddy and I thank God that she saw something in me and then she chose a man that has the Holy Spirit and that's a good husband to her and one day will be a good father to her [Music] children I pray that our legacies brothers and sisters as I've said it's not too late if it was too late your heart would not be beating it's not too late reach out move forward as a father as as a mother as a grandparent and help the ones that need it James says visit the fatherless do it reach out to those who need help and I promise you I promise you it'll make a [Music] difference I pledge aliance to the land with all my strength with all I am I will seek to honor his command pledge alance to the lamb don't you love him just Pledge Your Allegiance to the Lamb of God now Christians long ago were brought before a Ty Throne they were told that he would spare their lives if they would renounce the name
