[8:29] grace,
[8:31] how sweet
[8:33] the sound

[8:39] like me.
[8:43] I once

[8:47] but now
[8:49] I'm found.
[8:52] was blind,
[8:54] but now
[8:56] I see. Was grace.
[9:00] It was grace
[9:02] that taught
[9:04] my heart
[9:07] to fear
[9:09] and grace
[9:11] my fears
[9:13] relieve.
[9:17] How precious
[9:20] did
[9:22] that grace
[9:24] appear?

[9:28] I first
[9:30] be.
[9:33] My chains are gone.
[9:37] I've been set free.
[9:41] My God, my Savior

[17:17] Thank you, Sister Hope. As brother
[17:19] Daniel gets ready to come out, they that
[17:21] wait upon the Lord. Let's start with the
[17:25] verse. Teach me Lord Jo.
[17:28] Teach me Lord
[17:31] to wait.
[17:34] Down on
[17:36] my knees
[17:38] tell in your own good time.
[17:44] You answer
[17:47] my please.
[17:49] Teach me not
[17:51] to rely
[17:54] on what others
[17:57] do.
[17:59] Not to wait
[18:02] a prayer for the answer
[18:07] from you. For they that way upon the
[18:13] Lord
[18:15] shall renew
[18:17] their strength. They shall mountain
[18:23] with him
[18:25] as he goes.
[18:30] They shall run and not be weary.

[19:43] with his
[19:46] as he goes.
[19:50] They shall run and not be weary.
[19:56] They shall walk and not faint.
[20:01] Teach me Lord.
[20:03] Teach me
[20:06] to
[20:13] [Music]
[20:16] we stand a moment. Let's pray.
[20:21] [Music]
[20:25] Heavenly Father, we approach you in the
[20:27] name of Jesus Christ
[20:29] and ask Father that you'd be with us
[20:33] this evening as we read your word and
[20:36] and Lord that we would get out of it,
[20:40] the purpose that you had in recording
[20:42] it. Bless us tonight, Father, and all
[20:45] those that came here that might have a
[20:48] need. I pray that you'd meet those needs
[20:50] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be
[20:54] seated.
[20:56] Special thanks KG Fuji, my friend. God
[20:59] bless you. Good job
[21:04] bringing his talent all the way here all
[21:06] the way from Japan.
[21:09] Very uh kind-spirited
[21:12] brother.
[21:14] Um, I I asked Josiah to sing that song,
[21:20] They That Wait Upon the Lord, because
[21:22] we're going to be talking about King
[21:23] Saul again tonight. And it's something
[21:25] that Saul had a very difficult time
[21:27] doing. And that's that's waiting on the
[21:31] Lord. And, you know, I just I think all
[21:35] of us probably can relate to this man,
[21:38] Saul. I was telling Stephanie last night
[21:40] that that he's much more relatable to me
[21:43] than than David is. He just David was
[21:47] flawed like all of us, but Saul's flaws
[21:50] are just so easy to see. And and he
[21:53] suffered from from all of his flaws. He
[21:57] He made hasty decisions and he suffered
[22:00] for those hasty decisions. He got overly
[22:02] spiritual and he suffered for doing
[22:05] that. He lost his temper and he suffered
[22:08] for doing that. He said foolish things
[22:11] and he suffered for that. He was
[22:13] jealous. He got threatened by this young
[22:16] man David and he suffered for that too.
[22:20] To uh to be right it just when David
[22:25] came on the scene
[22:27] to be right Saul really should have just
[22:30] handed the whole kingdom over to David.
[22:34] But who could really do that? Who could
[22:37] have enough faith to really even though
[22:40] that they knew that God had Saul knew
[22:44] that God had chosen him, how could he
[22:47] have faith like that? I just I I look at
[22:50] Saul and and I see he he repented just
[22:53] over and over again. But then he would
[22:56] go and he would make the same mistake.
[22:59] How many of us, you don't have to raise
[23:02] your hand, do the same thing
[23:06] I do all the time. And I look at this
[23:10] this Saul and I just maybe God recorded
[23:14] so much about King Saul is because he
[23:16] wanted us to examine ourselves. And if
[23:20] you're like me, I thank God that I don't
[23:24] have to suffer like Saul suffered for
[23:28] making many of the same mistakes that I
[23:29] make. I um it's so easy to condemn other
[23:33] people.
[23:34] And whether in our everyday life or even
[23:38] when we read about them and it just he
[23:43] is is such a relatable person is King
[23:46] Saul. And I pray that I'm approaching
[23:48] this in the right way. I know that he an
[23:50] evil spirit took over his life and and
[23:53] he he really struggled with depression
[23:55] and and anxiety and there was a lot of
[23:58] problems with Saul. But I want to make
[24:01] Saul somebody that is easy to relate to
[24:05] so that we can see our flaws and we can
[24:08] thank the Lord that we don't have to
[24:10] suffer like he did and maybe make our
[24:13] wrongs right in a better way than Saul
[24:16] did.
[24:18] um the beginning of his reign. I'll do a
[24:20] little um recap. He was a humble man.
[24:24] He's tall. He was good-looking. He was
[24:26] well spoken. He was a king that the
[24:29] people of Israel could be proud of. He
[24:31] he uh at the very first when he was when
[24:36] he was presented with a problem,
[24:38] somebody was talking bad about him. He
[24:40] didn't lose his temper when these sons
[24:41] of Balile
[24:43] um started ridiculing him, started
[24:45] making fun of him and and putting him
[24:47] down. But he had mercy on them. He
[24:50] showed great leadership skills and
[24:54] really that never ended all the way till
[24:56] he died. He showed great leadership
[24:58] skills when he rallied all the tribes of
[25:00] Israel to battle at Jabish Gilead, his
[25:04] first battle with the Ammonites.
[25:06] Saul truly, he had the gifts to be a
[25:09] great king, but the whole reign of Saul
[25:13] from the beginning was just it was
[25:15] fundamentally flawed.
[25:18] I could never understand and and I I
[25:21] really believe that now I I can I kind
[25:23] of have a have a handle on it, but I
[25:25] could never understand why that God said
[25:28] that the people had rejected him. They
[25:31] had rejected God when they asked for a
[25:34] king.
[25:35] And then yet God gave them a king. And
[25:38] David that was a man after his own
[25:40] heart. It was obviously God's perfect
[25:44] will for the people of Israel to have a
[25:47] king.
[25:48] And Saul, he was God's choice as a king
[25:51] for Israel. And the people didn't choose
[25:54] Saul. God chose Saul. But I believe when
[25:57] the people asked for a king, they asked
[26:00] a miss. They wanted a king because of
[26:03] their lack of faith. They wanted a king
[26:06] because of their lack of desire to have
[26:08] a relationship with God. And that is
[26:12] that is why that this Saul came along.
[26:15] And let's understand the mistake that
[26:19] Israel made in wanting a king. It's
[26:22] really it's very very important that we
[26:25] we do a little uh recap on this because
[26:28] it really helps us understand Saul and
[26:31] it helps us really understand the whole
[26:33] Bible. The prophet Samuel, he was the
[26:36] last judge in Israel. The judges started
[26:39] after Joshua. They were leaders. Um one
[26:42] was a woman. Most were men who led
[26:44] Israel really out of harm that resulted
[26:47] from Israel's sins. Israel would send,
[26:51] then God would send a deliverer. Gideon,
[26:55] Samson, Deborah. Um, and the last judge
[27:00] was a prophet, one of the mightiest
[27:02] prophets that had ever walked the earth,
[27:03] and that was Samuel. Israel prospered
[27:08] really under the leadership of Moses.
[27:10] They prospered under Joshua. They
[27:12] prospered under all the the judges. And
[27:16] I'll say it again. They sinned when they
[27:21] did not have good leadership.
[27:23] Israel did. And Samuel was one of the
[27:27] greatest leaders in in all history. But
[27:30] he was getting old. His sons were
[27:33] sinful. People saw it. Other nations had
[27:37] kings who had led them in battle. And
[27:40] some of these kings are listed in the
[27:42] book of Judges. and the ones that fought
[27:44] against is Israel. And uh the books of
[27:48] books of Samuel, 1, 2 Samuel, 1, 2
[27:50] Kings, and then the books of the
[27:51] Chronicles list some of these foreign
[27:53] kings. And
[27:56] so they they had seen these other kings.
[27:59] And without the godly leadership of
[28:02] Samuel, their question was, who is going
[28:05] to lead us into battle against our
[28:08] enemies? And I really believe that
[28:09] that's where they they didn't have faith
[28:11] in God. And that's where they had
[28:12] forsaken God is because they they wanted
[28:15] someone to lead them rather than have
[28:17] faith. And God had always led them. He
[28:20] led them out of Egypt with Moses. He
[28:21] conquered the greatest army in the
[28:23] world. He he led them with Joshua. They
[28:26] they won almost every battle when when
[28:29] they were right with God. It was a good
[28:31] example from from Joshua and how the is
[28:34] Israel people lived. And after that,
[28:39] when they would fall into sin, they got
[28:42] used to having somebody be their really
[28:44] their Holy Spirit for them.
[28:47] Samuel was a prophet and everybody knew
[28:49] that.
[28:51] But what about when this prophet dies?
[28:53] What about when he leaves?
[28:55] The one thing that Saul, as we go
[28:58] through his testimony,
[29:00] he never failed in what the Israelites
[29:05] asked him to do, which was lead them in
[29:07] battle. He was a master. And he won war
[29:14] and battle after battle. He was exactly
[29:18] what the people asked for. Somebody they
[29:20] respected. He came from an affluent
[29:23] family
[29:24] and he was battleh hardened and battle
[29:27] tested.
[29:29] So really he was an outstanding
[29:32] choice for a king. But as he reigned, we
[29:34] saw that he started to make mistakes.
[29:37] The Lord told Samuel or the Lord told
[29:40] Saul through the prophet Samuel when
[29:43] they were preparing for battle to wait
[29:45] seven days before they went to battle.
[29:48] And then Samuel would arrive. They would
[29:51] make a sacrifice and they would go into
[29:54] battle which was very common before they
[29:57] would they would go. So Saul seven days
[30:01] passed Samuel didn't show up. So Saul
[30:05] made a hasty decision and he didn't wait
[30:08] for the prophet.
[30:10] Seven days came and then he decided that
[30:12] he was going to assume the role of a
[30:14] priest and make the sacrifice himself.
[30:16] Samuel showed up and then right after
[30:19] Saul had done that and he got a rebuke.
[30:23] Saul got a rebuke from Samuel. God still
[30:27] wanted and this is the thing that we
[30:29] have to understand. God wanted the
[30:31] sacrifice to be made. God wanted Saul to
[30:35] ride into battle and and defeat the
[30:37] enemy. But God has his way of doing
[30:41] things. And just because something
[30:43] sounds good religiously does not mean
[30:46] that it is good.
[30:48] Now, brother Brandham, one of uh my
[30:52] favorite sermons brother Brandham
[30:53] preached was trying to do God a service
[30:55] without it being the will of God. And in
[30:57] that sermon, in fact, I I don't know,
[31:00] probably 30 years ago, 25
[31:04] years ago, whatever it was, I wrote down
[31:07] in my Bible a quote from Brother
[31:10] Brandham about trying to do God a
[31:12] service without it being his will. And
[31:16] uh let's I want to read that quote to
[31:18] you. It says this.
[31:22] There's your five musts. It's got to be
[31:24] that way.
[31:26] his time. Speaking of God's time, it's
[31:30] got to be the right time to do it. God's
[31:32] time, his season when he said it would
[31:35] be the man that he chose to do it. And
[31:41] it must come to the prophet and the
[31:43] prophet must be a vindicated prophet. We
[31:45] find out many of them in the Bible when
[31:47] it comes to prophets. And it wasn't
[31:50] vindicated. So, Brother Brandham, leave
[31:53] the quote up there. Brother Brandham
[31:54] lines out the things that we have to do
[31:58] in making a a decision like this. And
[32:01] Saul
[32:03] may have been the right person to ride
[32:05] into battle and to defeat the enemy, not
[32:07] Samuel. But it was supposed to be Samuel
[32:10] to make the sacrifice, not Saul. God has
[32:14] his perfect his person ready for the
[32:18] job. And then he close then the end of
[32:21] the quote there it says our prophet is
[32:25] Jesus Christ.
[32:27] It shows that we can have
[32:31] that spirit of God within us that can
[32:36] make those decisions. It has to be the
[32:39] right person has to be the right time
[32:41] and it has to come from God really.
[32:47] So Saul was called to be king. Samuel
[32:50] was called to be prophet. Others were
[32:51] called to be priests. Each gift was
[32:54] ordained to operate in its own way. And
[32:57] Saul had taken too much on himself at
[33:00] that at that time. And under the
[33:02] pressure to go to battle and wanting to
[33:03] do the right thing, he made a hasty
[33:06] decision and made the sacrifice.
[33:08] Something God didn't want him to do.
[33:10] Many times he made a decision because it
[33:14] sounded good. And as we get deeper into
[33:17] Saul's life, we're going to see that he
[33:19] did this often. And it was often based
[33:22] on his emotions. It was an emotional
[33:25] response that Saul had or and many times
[33:30] it came out of fear, sometimes out of
[33:31] hatred, that he made
[33:35] a mistake. And as I was going through
[33:38] some of the mistakes that Saul made, I
[33:40] came up with a few things that that
[33:43] really that really influenced his
[33:47] problems. And the first one, and I think
[33:49] this is really the strongest one, is
[33:51] fear. And it's probably Saul's biggest
[33:55] weakness and called caused most of his
[33:57] mistakes. And it's the one thing that we
[33:59] don't see any, this is what's amazing.
[34:02] We don't see that fear in Saul when he's
[34:04] going into battle against the enemy.
[34:07] It's because he was in his calling from
[34:10] God. And there was no fear in that man.
[34:13] And and he was he was great at it. But
[34:15] when he was operating outside of that
[34:18] and he made poor choices, that's when
[34:21] you see that fear come in on him. And
[34:25] these hasty decisions
[34:27] that he made, these led to poor
[34:29] decisions. And we'll see tonight another
[34:32] hasty decision he made. Later on, if we
[34:35] continue on in this series, we'll see
[34:37] that Saul developed a temper.
[34:40] And uh this was brought on by fear and
[34:44] uh fear of David taking his kingdom and
[34:46] he tries to kill David multiple times.
[34:49] He followed his emotions rather than
[34:52] seeking God. a very easy thing for us
[34:56] all to do following our emotions rather
[35:00] than because our emotions can be very
[35:02] easily deceived.
[35:04] But if we would just seek God, get past
[35:07] those emotions, then then we can we can
[35:10] find the the right answer. And all this
[35:12] led as time goes on, it led to more and
[35:15] more pride on this man Saul. So for the
[35:20] lesson tonight, we'll see that uh that
[35:22] Saul again went on his emotions and did
[35:25] what seemed right on the outside. So he
[35:29] was excited.
[35:30] Saul was excited to see the power of God
[35:34] that I'm going to talk about in this
[35:36] story that I'm about to read. And then
[35:37] he brought the blessing. So So Saul Saul
[35:40] saw saw a miracle from God. And then he
[35:45] took those blessings that he had seen in
[35:48] that miracle and then he brought it to a
[35:51] place that God did not want it to go.
[35:55] And we'll read that tonight. And it,
[35:57] like I said at the beginning, it is so
[35:59] easy to make these mistakes that he
[36:01] made.
[36:03] He made a decision to get a little bit
[36:05] more spiritual than God required. And in
[36:08] doing that, he lost the respect of the
[36:10] people in his kingdom. and he almost
[36:13] lost his son Jonathan over this mistake.
[36:16] It's an ironic happening because his
[36:20] position as king, this is it's a very
[36:24] odd thing that happens. Saul's position
[36:27] as king, God required that the people
[36:31] honor his position as king and honor his
[36:35] directives even though he was wrong.
[36:39] It's it's it's an amazing thing and I
[36:41] we'll uh we'll get to it. Very very
[36:42] interesting story I'm going to talk
[36:43] about tonight. Let's get into it. 1st
[36:46] Samuel 14.
[36:48] Start with verse one. Now it came to
[36:51] pass upon a day that Jonathan the son of
[36:55] Saul said unto the young man that bear
[36:57] his armor, come and let us go over to
[37:00] the Philistines garrison that is on the
[37:02] other side. But he told not his father
[37:05] father. And Saul terried in the
[37:08] othermost part of Giba under a
[37:10] pomegranate tree which is in which is in
[37:13] Migron.
[37:15] And the people that were with him were
[37:18] about 600 men. And Aaya, the son of
[37:22] Ahitub, Icabad's brother, the son of
[37:26] Fineas, the son of Eli, the Lord's
[37:29] priest in Shiloh, wearing in Ephod.
[37:33] And the people knew not that Jonathan
[37:36] was gone. So what happened here
[37:41] is Jonathan.
[37:44] He was a warrior too. Mighty warrior.
[37:49] This is this is Saul's son. This is the
[37:51] heir to the throne. So Jonathan
[37:55] tells his armor bearer. He says, "Let's
[37:59] go up, you and me, and there's a
[38:02] garrison of the Philistines up on the
[38:04] hill. Let's you and me go up there,
[38:08] and we're going to climb up, and if the
[38:11] Philistines look down on us and say,
[38:15] "You stay down there. We're going to
[38:17] come down to you. Then we'll run back to
[38:20] camp." But if they say, "You come up
[38:23] here to us, then you and me will go up
[38:27] there and we'll kill them all." These
[38:31] are Philistines. These are big dudes.
[38:34] Big, strong warriors. So the armor
[38:37] bearer says, "Do whatever's on your
[38:39] heart, Jonathan. Let's go."
[38:41] So they go up there and there's two
[38:43] these two big sharp rocks and they go
[38:48] between those and then they they start
[38:50] up the mountain and and they get up to
[38:52] the area
[38:54] that these Philistines were and the
[38:58] Philistines they made themselves known
[39:00] these two men
[39:02] smaller men Israelites make themselves
[39:06] known to these 20 warriors up on the
[39:09] hill. They look down. And I always put
[39:13] myself whenever I tell this story, I
[39:15] think about the story. I don't put
[39:16] myself in Jonathan's place because I
[39:18] know Jonathan knew exactly what was
[39:20] going to happen. But I put myself in the
[39:22] armor bearer's place. And as they were
[39:25] as they were climbing up there, he was
[39:28] probably thinking in his mind,
[39:31] are they gonna tell us to come up or are
[39:33] they gonna say come down? And I wonder
[39:36] if he was scared
[39:38] that they were going to say, "Come up."
[39:42] So he's there. Jonathan says, "Okay,
[39:45] let's make oursel known to him." They
[39:47] stand out in the open. And you know what
[39:50] they said? They said, "Come up here."
[39:54] And Jonathan's like, "Let's do it." So
[39:57] they go up there, they climb up the
[39:58] mountain, they get up to the top, and
[40:00] they start they kill 20 of these these
[40:04] warriors. the uh the the armor bearer
[40:07] has Jonathan's back. Jonathan's killing
[40:10] them all. The armor bearer is killing
[40:11] them too. And they defeat all of these
[40:13] Philistines. So then all once this
[40:16] happened all of the whole army, the
[40:18] Philistine army, they all got scared and
[40:22] and then at that time the earth starts
[40:26] to shake.
[40:27] So the Philistines, they lose their
[40:30] minds and they start fighting each other
[40:34] and the Lord just does a mighty miracle.
[40:37] Let's start uh let's go to verse 16.
[40:41] And the watchmen of Saul in Giba
[40:45] of Benjamin looked and behold the
[40:48] multitude melted away and they went on
[40:51] beating down one another. Talking about
[40:53] the Philistines beating each other. And
[40:55] then Saul said unto the people that were
[40:56] with him, "Number now, and see who is
[40:59] gone from us." And when they had
[41:00] numbered, "Behold, Jonathan with his and
[41:02] his armor bearer were not there." And
[41:05] Saul said unto Aaya, "Bring hither the
[41:09] ark of God." For the ark of God was at
[41:12] that time with the children of Israel.
[41:15] And it came to pass while Saul talked
[41:17] with talked unto the priest that the
[41:20] noise that was in the host of the
[41:22] Philistines went on and increased. And
[41:25] Saul said unto the priest, "Withdraw thy
[41:27] hand." So what happened here is the
[41:29] priest Aaya who is uh mentioned at the
[41:31] beginning of the chapter some um
[41:35] they they go and get the ark and and
[41:38] Saul's going to seek the Lord and he
[41:39] sees hey the battle's on. He's like,
[41:40] "You know what? Forget it. Let's just go
[41:42] fight." So Saul goes down there. Saul
[41:45] and all the people that were with him
[41:47] assembled themselves together and they
[41:49] came to battle and behold every man's
[41:51] sword was against his fellow and there
[41:53] was a very great discomure.
[41:56] Philistines were killing each other and
[41:59] there was a great confusion
[42:01] everywhere. Moreover, the Hebrews that
[42:04] were with the Philistines before that
[42:06] time, which went up um which went up
[42:09] with them into the camp from the country
[42:11] roundabout, even they also turned to be
[42:14] with the Israelites that were with Saul
[42:17] and Jonathan. So, the Hebrews that were
[42:19] on the Philistine side, they turned and
[42:24] they turned on the Philistines
[42:27] and they started fighting with their
[42:28] fellow countrymen, the the Hebrews.
[42:30] Likewise, all the men of Israel, which
[42:32] had hid themselves in Mount Ephraim,
[42:35] when they had heard that the Philistines
[42:37] fled, even they also followed hard after
[42:40] them in the battle. So the Lord saved
[42:44] that day, and the battle passed over
[42:47] unto Beth Haven. So this was a great
[42:50] victory that the Lord had given the
[42:51] Israelites under the leadership of of
[42:53] Saul. Jonathan and his armor bearer are
[42:56] the ones that actually got it started.
[42:58] They got the ball rolling and they
[43:00] probably increased the faith of these
[43:02] Israelites and then Saul jumped on board
[43:05] and he destroyed this Philistine army.
[43:08] It's a great example of God's power. And
[43:12] imagine the victory. Here's Jonathan and
[43:15] his armor bearer killing 20 warriors. An
[43:18] earthquake
[43:20] comes. The Philistines panic. They start
[43:23] killing each other. And then Saul's army
[43:26] rolls down through and just destroys
[43:28] everything in their path. And God was
[43:31] the head of all of it. Can you imagine
[43:33] the rejoicing? Can you imagine the
[43:34] encouragement? Can you imagine how they
[43:36] felt? Now Saul makes a crucial mistake.
[43:42] Instead of just leading his army into
[43:45] battle, he did something that might
[43:47] sound good religiously.
[43:51] He commanded all the people to fast.
[43:54] don't eat. We have them on the run
[43:57] because of God. So, let's keep this
[44:01] going and devote more of ourselves to
[44:03] God. We want more consecration. It
[44:05] sounds good, right? But wasn't God's
[44:09] will.
[44:11] And the men of Israel
[44:13] were distressed that day. For Saul had
[44:16] adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be
[44:18] the man that eateth any food until
[44:21] evening, that I may be avenged on mine
[44:25] enemies, so none of the people tasted
[44:28] any food." We have to be careful with
[44:32] our religious ways.
[44:35] I talk about the Holy Spirit a lot and
[44:38] how the Holy Spirit is the word of God
[44:41] that's really dwelling within us.
[44:44] There's a time to fast. There's a time
[44:47] to eat. Really, there's a time to pray.
[44:50] And there's a time to work. There's a
[44:53] time to go to church. And there's a time
[44:55] to rest.
[44:57] You know, let's let's read it. Let me
[44:59] read. I didn't give Ecclesiastes 3, but
[45:03] uh could we turn to Ecclesiastes 3?
[45:06] We'll go to um verse number one.
[45:11] says this, "To everything there is a
[45:13] season,
[45:15] a time for every purpose under heaven. A
[45:18] time to be born and a time to die. A
[45:22] time to plant and a time to pluck what
[45:25] is planted. A time to kill and a time to
[45:28] heal. A time to break down and a time to
[45:32] build up. A time to weep and a time to
[45:35] laugh. A time to mourn and a time to
[45:37] dance. A time to cast away stones and a
[45:40] time to gather stones. A time to embrace
[45:43] and a time to refrain from embracing. A
[45:45] time to gain and a time to lose.
[45:49] A time to keep and a time to throw away.
[45:52] A time to tear and a time to sow.
[45:56] A time to keep silence and a time to
[45:58] speak. A time to love, a time to hate,
[46:02] and a time of war and a time of peace.
[46:06] And although
[46:08] Fasting
[46:09] is right and praying is right. That was
[46:13] not the time to do that. When they were
[46:16] going to battle, remember that Jonathan,
[46:20] this is very important. Jonathan didn't
[46:22] know the order to fast. He was killing
[46:25] Philistines at the time when when Saul
[46:27] gave it. And it all comes to a very very
[46:31] odd set of circumstances that really has
[46:35] no wind because of Saul's decision.
[46:38] Verse number 25
[46:40] of uh 1 Samuel. Thank you.
[46:44] And all they of the land came to a wood
[46:47] and there was honey upon the ground. And
[46:50] when the people were come into the wood,
[46:51] behold, the honey dropped, but no man
[46:54] put his hand to his mouth, for the
[46:57] people feared the oath, that oath from
[46:59] Saul to fast.
[47:02] But Jonathan
[47:03] heard not when his father charged the
[47:06] people with the oath. Wherefore he put
[47:08] the end of his rod that was in his hand,
[47:10] and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put it
[47:14] put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes
[47:17] were enlightened.
[47:19] So it gave him strength. I remember I
[47:22] was fasting one time. I don't remember
[47:24] what I was praying for. Maybe in my mom
[47:26] or I don't remember what it was. Um, but
[47:30] I was on the about the third day of a
[47:33] fast and you get really weak and I was
[47:37] outside
[47:38] and uh we were working at a youth camp
[47:42] and somebody came by and gave me a
[47:46] Gatorade.
[47:48] And I'll tell you, I was weak. And I
[47:51] took that Gatorade and I was like,
[47:56] I'm thirsty and and I'll just I'll just
[47:58] drink I'll just drink a little bit of
[47:59] it. And I knew I was fasting
[48:02] and it was I don't know if my mouth
[48:05] absorbed the sugar, but it was an
[48:09] immediate
[48:11] just just rush of strength. It didn't
[48:14] last very long because it was just a
[48:15] little bit. But just that little bit of
[48:17] Gatorade really lifted me up. And that's
[48:22] what happened with the with Jonathan is
[48:23] he took that honey. And it just gave him
[48:26] some strength. Then answered one of the
[48:29] people and said, "Thy father straightly
[48:30] charged the people with an oath, saying,
[48:32] "Cursed be the man that eateth any food
[48:35] this day." And the people were faint.
[48:38] Then Jonath then said Jonathan, my
[48:41] father hath troubled the land.
[48:44] See, I pray you how mine eyes have been
[48:47] enlightened because I tasted a little of
[48:50] this honey. How much more if happily the
[48:53] people had eaten freely today of the
[48:55] spoil of their enemies which they found.
[48:58] For had there not been now as much
[49:01] greater a slaughter among the
[49:02] Philistines. So Jonathan is undermining
[49:06] his dad
[49:08] and he's saying
[49:10] no matter how how wrong Saul was and
[49:13] he's saying that we would have done a
[49:16] better job killing these Philistines if
[49:19] you guys were eating all of the food
[49:21] that you took from the Philistines. So
[49:23] So you're you're going into the camp and
[49:25] they got some good bread here and they
[49:27] got honey and they got butter and they
[49:29] got all this and you're starving to
[49:30] death. Why didn't you just eat some of
[49:32] the food? You would have had more
[49:33] strength.
[49:36] But the king, even though he was wrong,
[49:39] had given a decree not to do it.
[49:43] And they smoked the Philistines that day
[49:45] from Mcmash to Agelon. And the people
[49:48] were very faint. And the people flew
[49:50] upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen
[49:55] and calves and slew them on the ground.
[49:58] And the people did eat them with the
[50:01] blood.
[50:03] Now this is an abomination.
[50:05] We know about kosher food. This is an
[50:08] abomination. What the people were doing
[50:11] for a Jew to eat meat that hasn't been
[50:14] properly prepared. And this was not
[50:17] properly prepared because the the blood
[50:20] the because of the laws about the blood,
[50:22] the laws from Moses. So they were hungry
[50:25] after the battle. They followed Saul's
[50:28] command until the evening. So now they
[50:31] did no disobey the king, but now they
[50:34] disobeyed God
[50:37] for eating this this this unclean way.
[50:43] So Saul's ill-thought command
[50:46] caused the people really to commit
[50:48] another unrelated sin. And then it gets
[50:52] worse.
[50:54] Then they told Saul,
[50:57] saying, "Behold,
[50:58] the people sin against the Lord, and
[51:01] that they eat with the blood."
[51:05] So this whoever it is, a priest came to
[51:07] him or one of his servants came to him
[51:09] and said, "Listen, the people are
[51:11] sinning. They're they're breaking
[51:13] Moses's commandment and they're eating
[51:15] this the this meat with the blood in
[51:19] it." And then here's what Saul does.
[51:21] Here's what Saul says. King Saul, he
[51:23] says, "You have transgressed.
[51:26] It can't be my fault.
[51:29] You've done wrong.
[51:32] Roll a great stone to me this day." So,
[51:36] he's blaming somebody else for his
[51:39] mistake. Now, he says, "Roll this stone
[51:42] up
[51:43] up to me."
[51:45] So remember how I said earlier that Saul
[51:49] passed the blame on to others and here
[51:51] he blames the people. He says, "You have
[51:53] transgressed.
[51:55] Anybody but himself is to blame." So now
[51:59] we've got a mess.
[52:01] A great battle was won
[52:04] and the Lord did a miracle.
[52:07] And because of because of Saul's
[52:09] misplaced zeal,
[52:12] it caused the people to sin.
[52:14] So he gets a big stone. Saul gets this
[52:17] this big stone and then they start
[52:18] killing the animals on it and properly
[52:21] preparing the food.
[52:23] And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves
[52:27] among the people, and say unto them,
[52:31] bring me hither every man his ox, and
[52:35] every man his sheep, and slay them here,
[52:39] and eat, and send not against the Lord
[52:42] in eating with the blood." So he's
[52:45] saying, "Do it right now." and all the
[52:48] people brought every man his ox with him
[52:50] that night and slew them there. Remember
[52:54] Saul's decree, the fast was over now. So
[52:57] s now Saul is in damage control.
[53:01] He's trying to keep the people from
[53:02] sinning and facilitating keeping co the
[53:05] kosher way of eating the animals. But
[53:08] really, it's his fault that they were
[53:10] starving to death.
[53:12] And Saul built an altar unto the Lord.
[53:15] The same was the first altar that he
[53:17] built unto the Lord. And Saul said, "Let
[53:20] us go down after the Philistines by
[53:23] night, and spoil them until the morning
[53:26] light, and let us not leave a man of
[53:29] them."
[53:31] And then they said, "Do whatever seemth
[53:34] good unto thee."
[53:36] Then the priest said, "Let us draw near
[53:40] hither unto God." So the army was behind
[53:44] him, but the priest said, "Don't you
[53:48] think we had to pray about this first?"
[53:50] what we would say today and it's so many
[53:53] times and brother Aaron knows how many
[53:54] decisions are made in a church
[53:58] that it may seem like something trivial
[54:02] but we need to pray about every single
[54:05] thing because even the little thing
[54:08] that Saul said about
[54:12] let's fast it caused all of these
[54:15] problems.
[54:17] So
[54:19] this this priest says, "Hey, well, let's
[54:21] let's seek God about this. Let's pray
[54:23] about this first." So today
[54:27] we one of the lessons we get from this
[54:30] and Saul really made this mistake many
[54:32] many times
[54:34] is always bring things before the Lord.
[54:37] And I read that quote from brother
[54:38] Brandham at the be beginning that we
[54:41] need to seek God and make sure it may be
[54:44] the exact right decision to make but it
[54:48] may be the wrong time to make it. It may
[54:52] be the right thing to do but it may be
[54:54] the wrong person to do it. There's so
[54:57] many different things going on. And
[54:59] that's why Paul said that he said I pray
[55:02] I I pray always. That's why we should
[55:05] always be seeking the Lord on everything
[55:06] that we do. Every little decision, Lord,
[55:08] what is your will? And then the Holy
[55:10] Spirit, if our heart's right, the Holy
[55:12] Spirit will, he may allow us to make
[55:14] make a mistake, but he'll fix it because
[55:17] our heart is right or he'll let us make
[55:20] the right decisions.
[55:23] So this man says, "Let's pray about it."
[55:24] And obviously
[55:26] Saul, it was good. And Saul asked
[55:29] counsel of God, and he said, "Shall I go
[55:32] down after the Philistines?
[55:35] Wilt thou deliver them into the hand of
[55:37] Israel?"
[55:39] But he answered him, "Not that day."
[55:42] This is strange. Saul knew he was to go
[55:45] to battle.
[55:47] Saul knew he was in the Lord's will and
[55:49] doing these things. And then yet, God
[55:51] would not answer. So, there was
[55:54] something wrong. Remember Saul's king.
[55:58] He's the one that is seeking the Lord
[56:00] over this. And
[56:03] he also had that authority. And even if
[56:05] Saul makes a bad decision, God still
[56:08] placed him as king. So the people in the
[56:10] kingdom are obligated to follow what he
[56:13] says to do. As long as it's not against
[56:16] God and not sin, they're obligated to do
[56:19] it. Even if he makes the wrong decision,
[56:20] we're going to see that right here. He
[56:23] had the God-given authority as king.
[56:26] But God didn't answer yes or no. And he
[56:28] remained silent. And as I said, this was
[56:31] a bad sign. Something was wrong.
[56:34] And Saul said, "Draw ye near hither,
[56:39] all the chief of the people, and know
[56:41] and see wherein this sin hath been this
[56:44] day."
[56:46] Someone in the camp had sinned. Remember
[56:48] the story of Achen and Joshua. Achen
[56:52] disobeyed Joshua's orders of not taking
[56:55] any of the spoils of the battle of Ai.
[56:59] Uh or was it Jericho?
[57:02] Don't take any of the any of the spoils.
[57:04] And then um Achen goes in and he steals
[57:08] a wedge of gold and he steals a
[57:09] Babylonian garment. He just takes them.
[57:12] No big deal. Nobody's going to know. He
[57:14] takes them. But God knew. and he hit him
[57:18] and then they go to battle and they lose
[57:22] men. The curse of one little sin that
[57:26] Achen made
[57:28] was poured out upon all of Israel.
[57:32] And here is the same thing. Someone had
[57:37] sinned in the army.
[57:40] What had happened?
[57:42] So Saul is seeking God and he's not
[57:45] answering. So he knows something is
[57:47] wrong. And he says this, "For as the
[57:51] Lord liveth, which saveth Israel, though
[57:53] it be Jonathan my son,
[57:56] he shall surely die."
[57:59] But there was not a man among all the
[58:01] people that answered him. So remember
[58:04] back
[58:05] couple lessons ago when Saul prophesied
[58:07] with the prophets, whether he made a bad
[58:09] or a hasty decision or not, he was and
[58:13] always would be a gifted man. this man
[58:15] Saul. There's a bit of foreshadowing
[58:17] here. And I doubt that Saul had any idea
[58:20] in saying what he said that this was
[58:23] going to affect his son Jonathan.
[58:27] And as many of the leaders probably knew
[58:31] exactly what was going on, but you
[58:33] notice they held their peace because
[58:35] they respected that great warrior
[58:37] Jonathan.
[58:39] Then said he unto all Israel, "Be ye on
[58:44] one side, and I and Jonathan, my son,
[58:48] will be on the other side." And the
[58:49] people said unto Saul, "Do what seemth
[58:51] good unto thee?" So Saul and his son,
[58:56] his right-hand man, the heir apparent of
[58:58] his throne, were standing here, and
[59:01] they're looking out on all of the
[59:03] soldiers and all of the generals and all
[59:05] of the people that were going to battle.
[59:07] And there and Saul is looking and he's
[59:09] thinking, "Okay, which one is it going
[59:11] to be?
[59:12] Which one of these men sinned? Which one
[59:15] of these men went against my decree?"
[59:18] Which which was against the king?
[59:23] And he said, "Unto all Israel, be ye on
[59:26] one side. I and my I and Jonathan my son
[59:28] will be on the other side." And the
[59:30] people said unto Saul, "Do what seemth
[59:32] good unto thee?" Therefore Saul said
[59:34] unto the Lord God of Israel, give a
[59:37] perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were
[59:40] taken. But the people escaped. Let me
[59:43] read another translation of that. And
[59:44] I'll explain what's going on. NLT
[59:48] translation says this. Then Saul prayed,
[59:51] "Oh Lord, God of Israel, please show us
[59:53] who is guilty and who is innocent." Then
[59:56] they cast sacred lots and Jonathan and
[59:59] Saul were chosen as the guilty ones and
[1:00:03] the people were declared innocent.
[1:00:07] So it's like, whoa, all of these ones,
[1:00:11] they're not the ones, it's me or my son
[1:00:16] are the guilty ones. Now, what is this
[1:00:18] casting lots?
[1:00:21] I uh I looked this up and I I found and
[1:00:24] this is the best
[1:00:27] um explanation of casting lots that I
[1:00:30] could find. It's on um a Christian
[1:00:33] website called gotquestions.org
[1:00:36] and it says this, "The practice of
[1:00:38] casting lots is mentioned 70 times in
[1:00:41] the Old Testament and seven times in the
[1:00:44] New Testament. In spite of the many
[1:00:47] references to casting lots in the Old
[1:00:48] Testament, nothing is known about the
[1:00:51] actual lots themselves.
[1:00:54] They could have been sticks of various
[1:00:55] lengths. They could have been flat
[1:00:57] stones like coins or some kind of dice,
[1:01:00] but their exact nature is unknown. The
[1:01:02] closest modern practice to casting lots
[1:01:05] is likely flipping a coin.
[1:01:09] Now, this is important.
[1:01:11] The practice of casting lots occurs most
[1:01:14] often in connection with the division of
[1:01:16] the land under Joshua. Joshua chapters
[1:01:20] 14- 21. A procedure that God instructed
[1:01:24] the Israelites on several times in the
[1:01:27] book of Numbers.
[1:01:29] God allowed the to God allowed the
[1:01:32] Israelites to cast lots in order to
[1:01:34] determine his will for a given
[1:01:37] situation.
[1:01:38] Various offices and functions in the
[1:01:40] temple were also determined by lot. The
[1:01:43] sailors on Jonah's ship also cast lots
[1:01:45] to determine who had who had brought
[1:01:48] God's wrath down upon the ship. The 11
[1:01:51] the 11 apostles cast lots to determine
[1:01:53] who would replace Judas in the book of
[1:01:55] acts. So casting lots and the yur and
[1:02:00] thumb
[1:02:02] in the old testament were really now
[1:02:05] this is me speaking were replaced by the
[1:02:07] holy spirit operating in the person to
[1:02:11] make a decision all after the day of
[1:02:12] pentecost
[1:02:14] but the casting of lots in the old
[1:02:18] testament was god a godgiving given way
[1:02:23] to make a decision. God was with it. All
[1:02:27] right?
[1:02:29] And Saul said verse number 42.
[1:02:33] And I I do believe I we don't we don't
[1:02:35] have a Ouija board. We're not throwing
[1:02:36] dice. We're not flipping a coin today.
[1:02:38] We are praying about things and we're
[1:02:40] asking God and we're trusting that the
[1:02:42] Holy Spirit will lead us. Back then it
[1:02:46] was different.
[1:02:48] And Saul cast lots between and and Saul
[1:02:52] said, "Cast lots between me and
[1:02:55] Jonathan, my son." And Jonathan was
[1:02:58] taken.
[1:03:00] Imagine how Saul felt.
[1:03:02] Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me
[1:03:06] what thou hast done."
[1:03:09] And Jonathan told him and said, "I did
[1:03:12] but taste a little honey with the end of
[1:03:14] the rod that was in mine hand. and lo, I
[1:03:18] must die."
[1:03:20] Saul answered, "God, do so and more
[1:03:23] also, for thou shalt surely die,
[1:03:25] Jonathan." Now, Israel had never had a
[1:03:27] king. Other kings had to abide by their
[1:03:30] own decrees, even if that decree was
[1:03:33] made an error. So, here is Saul. He was
[1:03:35] either angry or he was just trying to be
[1:03:37] a king. But he sentenced his own son to
[1:03:41] death because of his own hasty decision
[1:03:44] earlier to have the warriors fast while
[1:03:47] they were in battle.
[1:03:49] A decision that sounded good and
[1:03:52] spiritual at the time to do it, but it
[1:03:54] had dire consequences.
[1:03:57] And it leads to this tense situation
[1:03:59] between Saul
[1:04:01] and Jonathan. He's about to have his son
[1:04:04] killed because he broke that decree that
[1:04:08] he didn't even know about.
[1:04:11] And what's amazing to me,
[1:04:14] and this is when I when I read this
[1:04:16] story, I thought, "Wow, God
[1:04:21] is the one that identified Jonathan."
[1:04:24] God is the one that wouldn't speak to
[1:04:26] Saul because of what Jonathan did
[1:04:30] because he broke the decree of the king.
[1:04:34] Very odd thing. Very very it it was it's
[1:04:38] hard for me to understand that because
[1:04:40] you you see here you have you have the
[1:04:42] king was wrong in doing it. But then
[1:04:44] Jonathan not knowing ate the honey but
[1:04:48] then he kind of undermined his dad. And
[1:04:51] the people said unto Saul,
[1:04:54] "Sa, shall Jonathan die?
[1:04:57] Who hath wrought this great salvation in
[1:05:00] Israel?
[1:05:02] God forbid.
[1:05:04] As the Lord liveth, there shall not one
[1:05:07] hair of his head fall to the ground."
[1:05:09] They probably lifted up their swords,
[1:05:12] their spears, and like Saul, no, you're
[1:05:16] not touching him.
[1:05:19] There shall not one hair of his head
[1:05:20] fall to the ground, for he hath wrought
[1:05:23] with God this day. So the people rescued
[1:05:26] Jonathan that he died not.
[1:05:30] So fortunately,
[1:05:32] Jonathan's fellow warriors
[1:05:35] and all the people, they really stuck up
[1:05:38] for him to the king.
[1:05:40] And so my question
[1:05:43] is that isn't I don't really have an
[1:05:45] answer for it, but
[1:05:48] where is God in all of this? What
[1:05:52] position did God take in all of this?
[1:05:54] Jonathan didn't know and he ate the
[1:05:56] honey, but Jonathan criticized the
[1:05:58] king's degree decree. And Jonathan was
[1:06:01] the main man. He was the top general. He
[1:06:04] was the heir to the throne. and his
[1:06:06] words meant more much more than just the
[1:06:09] common soldier. But God didn't answer
[1:06:13] the question when Saul asked to go to
[1:06:16] battle because someone had sinned and
[1:06:19] then God told on Jonathan and the people
[1:06:22] protected Jonathan. So who is right in
[1:06:24] all of this? Then Saul,
[1:06:28] he still has the original question.
[1:06:31] Well, do we go to battle or not?
[1:06:35] And really here,
[1:06:38] how many times
[1:06:40] have all of us been in that same
[1:06:43] situation?
[1:06:44] It's like, "Wow, Lord, I really messed
[1:06:46] this up. I did wrong. Maybe I caused
[1:06:51] somebody else to do wrong.
[1:06:54] And maybe I was my heart was wrong in
[1:06:57] the beginning. And
[1:06:59] what a mess that I've created. And now
[1:07:01] I'm having to live in this. Lord, I
[1:07:04] don't know what to do.
[1:07:07] And Saul's in that position right now.
[1:07:10] And Saul's like,
[1:07:14] "My army's not following me.
[1:07:17] They've forsaken me. My son went against
[1:07:21] my decree.
[1:07:25] I maybe made a mistake." So Saul's like,
[1:07:30] "What do I do?" It doesn't say say this,
[1:07:33] but he's about to make a decision and we
[1:07:35] know that that was that was in his mind.
[1:07:37] So really Saul's great victory
[1:07:41] at Mcmash
[1:07:43] with the earthquake and with Jonathan
[1:07:45] and and with the Philistines fighting
[1:07:48] each other and then them coming in and
[1:07:50] routing it. It was really overshadowed
[1:07:55] by his own people overruling him. So
[1:07:59] Saul went home that day. They should
[1:08:01] have been celebrating
[1:08:03] and he really went home defeated
[1:08:08] and it's starting to build this complex
[1:08:11] in Saul.
[1:08:13] And you can see now that he's making
[1:08:17] decisions and he's getting chastised
[1:08:20] for it. And even the people that he is
[1:08:22] king over now are forsaking it.
[1:08:26] And here's the decision he makes.
[1:08:29] And Saul went up from following the
[1:08:32] Philistines
[1:08:33] and the Philist Phil Philistines went to
[1:08:35] their own place. So really believe he
[1:08:37] made a good decision here. And that's so
[1:08:40] often when we find ourselves heard
[1:08:44] when you see that you've dug yourself a
[1:08:46] hole,
[1:08:48] the first thing you do is stop digging.
[1:08:51] And and Saul did that. He said, "Okay,
[1:08:55] well,
[1:08:57] let's just go home. Let's not chase him
[1:09:00] down. Let's not destroy him. Really, if
[1:09:03] God's not with us, then let's just let's
[1:09:06] just go home." So then Saul went up from
[1:09:09] following the Philistines, and the
[1:09:10] Philistines went down to their place.
[1:09:15] And they didn't try to chase this
[1:09:18] victory. A lot of times it's just the
[1:09:21] best to just stop. Just stop,
[1:09:26] regroup, go home, and then maybe sleep
[1:09:29] on it sometime.
[1:09:32] The musicians can come when we'll close.
[1:09:35] But then God continues to bless Saul's
[1:09:37] leadership on the battlefield.
[1:09:40] He doesn't fail as a military leader. He
[1:09:42] continues winning battles. God continues
[1:09:44] to bless Israel. But in the next
[1:09:47] chapter, Saul again makes a hasty
[1:09:50] decision. We don't have to time to go
[1:09:51] through it tonight, but the next
[1:09:53] chapter, Saul again makes the hasty
[1:09:55] decision. He does what makes sense in
[1:09:58] his mind rather than doing what God had
[1:10:00] commanded.
[1:10:02] And that will be the mistake that leads
[1:10:06] to the anointing of this young man named
[1:10:09] David
[1:10:11] to one day take his place as king.
[1:10:16] And uh we'll see
[1:10:18] Saul descend into a very dark depression
[1:10:22] that will really stay with him the rest
[1:10:24] of his life. Verse number 47. So Saul
[1:10:28] took the kingdom over Israel and fought
[1:10:31] against all his enemies on every side
[1:10:33] against Moab and against the children of
[1:10:35] Ammon and against Edom and against the
[1:10:38] kings of Zoba and against the
[1:10:39] Philistines. And whethersoever he turned
[1:10:42] himself, he vexed them.
[1:10:46] And he gathered a host and smokeote the
[1:10:48] Amalachites and delivered Israel out of
[1:10:51] the hands of them that spoiled them.
[1:10:54] Other translations, English Standard
[1:10:56] Version says, "And he did valiantly and
[1:11:00] stuck the Amalachites and delivered
[1:11:03] Israel out of the hands who pl of of
[1:11:05] those who plundered them."
[1:11:09] Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan
[1:11:12] and Ishua and Melishua.
[1:11:15] And the names of his daughters were
[1:11:17] these. The name of the firstborn was
[1:11:20] Miraab. And the name of the younger was
[1:11:22] Michael. That name has come up in
[1:11:25] brother Lyall's ministry on David. And
[1:11:29] the name of Saul's wife was a Henino,
[1:11:34] the daughter of Aheime.
[1:11:37] The name of the captain of his host was
[1:11:39] Abnner,
[1:11:40] the son of Nurr, Saul's uncle. And Kish,
[1:11:44] was the father of Saul, and Nurr, the
[1:11:47] father of Abnner, was the son of Abiel.
[1:11:51] And there was sore war against the
[1:11:53] Philistines all the days of Saul. And
[1:11:55] when Saul saw any strong man or any
[1:11:58] valiant man, he took him unto him.
[1:12:02] Remember, God had told the people of
[1:12:04] Israel, he said that this king that
[1:12:07] you're asking for, he's going to take
[1:12:09] your young men
[1:12:11] and he's going to send them into battle.
[1:12:13] And here Saul does just that. He builds
[1:12:16] this army and he fights valiantly, but
[1:12:21] he will continue to make these
[1:12:25] illadvised mistakes
[1:12:28] and
[1:12:29] act on fear. act on temper, act without
[1:12:35] praying or take try to take the place of
[1:12:38] a priest and continue to make mistakes.
[1:12:42] And as I said in this next chapter
[1:12:45] in uh chapter 15, we saw this was the
[1:12:48] final point that God rejected Saul. And
[1:12:51] at one point even says that he regretted
[1:12:53] that he even made Saul king.
[1:12:56] And uh he uh
[1:13:00] goes and um
[1:13:04] he
[1:13:06] loses his repentance. He loses his his
[1:13:10] character as one that uh really um is
[1:13:15] willing to take other people's advice.
[1:13:19] And um I just it's a tragic story, but
[1:13:24] as I said at the beginning, so many of
[1:13:26] the mistakes that Saul made, I can see
[1:13:29] in my own life, and I think you probably
[1:13:31] can, too. Like, wow, I thank God that I
[1:13:36] don't have to suffer like Saul did in
[1:13:40] his kingdom. Josiah,
[1:13:46] whatever you feel, it's fine.
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:51] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:13:58] Make it ever true.
[1:14:04] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:14:11] May I be like you. Sing that again.
[1:14:14] Change my heart.
[1:14:17] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:14:23] Make it ever true.
[1:14:29] Change my heart. Oh God,
[1:14:36] may I be like you. You are the father.
[1:14:43] You are the father.
[1:14:48] I am the clay.
[1:14:55] Hold me and make
[1:14:58] me.
[1:15:00] This is what I pray.
[1:15:06] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:15:13] Make it ever true.
[1:15:19] Change my heart. Oh God,
[1:15:25] may I be like you.
[1:15:29] Change my heart. Change my heart. Oh
[1:15:33] God.
[1:15:37] Make it ever true.
[1:15:43] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:15:50] May I be like you.
[1:15:55] Now when we get into the Lord terries
[1:15:58] and we continue on the psalm,
[1:16:02] we,
[1:16:04] you know, it's it's I believe ordained
[1:16:06] of the Lord. I was about to say
[1:16:10] that
[1:16:13] the enemy has a way of getting in our
[1:16:16] lives
[1:16:18] and he can really attack us. He can
[1:16:21] really beat us down.
[1:16:24] And Sister Becky's beating you down.
[1:16:28] But you have to know and we always have
[1:16:30] to realize
[1:16:32] that
[1:16:34] God loves us.
[1:16:37] God loves you. God loves me.
[1:16:41] God He and He cares.
[1:16:45] And
[1:16:47] Sister Elizabeth, if you come up, he
[1:16:49] cares about us.
[1:16:52] And
[1:16:54] with this King Saul, mistake after
[1:16:58] mistake after mistake,
[1:17:01] but
[1:17:03] God was still with them.
[1:17:06] God God still won the battles for him,
[1:17:09] but it was when he got out of his role,
[1:17:13] when he got out of his calling that he
[1:17:16] had is when he failed. And I do I really
[1:17:20] believe that God allowed this King Saul.
[1:17:24] I believe that he allowed this story to
[1:17:27] be in the Bible so that we could place
[1:17:30] ourselves in this book and see all of
[1:17:34] these weaknesses, all of these failures
[1:17:36] and say, "Lord, I have many of these
[1:17:39] same problems. Help me to overcome them.
[1:17:44] Lord, let your spirit rest upon me."
[1:17:48] And then when that enemy comes in and he
[1:17:50] tries to attack you and he tries to get
[1:17:52] you down and he tries to just draw the
[1:17:55] the the happiness out of you, then we
[1:17:59] can cry out like David cried out, "Lord,
[1:18:02] put the joy back into my salvation."
[1:18:07] And he will. The same God that was there
[1:18:11] with Samuel, the same God that won these
[1:18:14] battles for King Saul, the same God that
[1:18:18] led Samuel to anoint David King, is the
[1:18:22] same God that's here with us tonight
[1:18:25] and he's with you.
[1:18:28] And it's so hard, friends. It is so hard
[1:18:32] to have faith in God. We want to do like
[1:18:36] Saul. It's human nature. We want to take
[1:18:39] control. We want to make the decision.
[1:18:42] We want to make everything work. But
[1:18:44] that is not God's way. God wants to be
[1:18:48] our king. He wants to be our ruler. He
[1:18:52] wants to fill us with the Holy Spirit.
[1:18:54] He wants the Holy Spirit to lead us in
[1:18:58] everything. He doesn't want us to make
[1:19:00] the same decision that the Israelites
[1:19:02] made saying, "Lord, we want someone to
[1:19:05] lead us into battle because we don't
[1:19:07] want to have that relationship with
[1:19:09] you." As I said at the beginning, I
[1:19:11] believe with all of my heart that it was
[1:19:13] God's will that they had a king
[1:19:17] and then Jesus came through that
[1:19:19] lineage. I really believe that.
[1:19:23] And it's his will that we have the Holy
[1:19:28] Spirit. And and there's an order of
[1:19:31] things, of course, but God wants that
[1:19:34] relationship with us. Amen. Let's all
[1:19:36] stand.
[1:19:38] Just silent,
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:49] winds of faith.
[1:19:55] There are two roads
[1:20:00] you may take,
[1:20:04] one by side
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] and one by faith.
[1:20:12] Take the word of God
[1:20:16] or what you see.
[1:20:20] What you believe
[1:20:24] is what will be.
[1:20:29] Set your way
[1:20:33] to the winds of faith.
[1:20:37] You can fly
[1:20:41] in a higher place.
[1:20:46] Do not struggle.
[1:20:50] It's by grace.
[1:20:54] Set your wings
[1:20:57] to the winds of faith.
[1:21:02] Oh, what's your need
[1:21:06] and what's your cry?
[1:21:11] What's your mouth?
[1:21:14] Much too high.
[1:21:18] Oh, speak the word of God.
[1:21:23] By and by,
[1:21:26] it will move
[1:21:30] for you.
[1:21:34] Set your wings
[1:21:38] to the winds of fame.
[1:21:42] You can fly
[1:21:46] in a high place.
[1:21:50] Do not struggle.
[1:21:54] It's by grace.
[1:21:58] Set your wings
[1:22:02] to the wind
[1:22:06] and watch the eagle
[1:22:10] in the sky.
[1:22:14] He does not struggle.
[1:22:18] He does not strive.
[1:22:22] For the power
[1:22:26] makes him rise
[1:22:30] is already
[1:22:34] in the sky.
[1:22:38] Set your wings
[1:22:41] to the winds of faith.
[1:22:46] You can fly
[1:22:49] in a higher place.
[1:22:53] Do not struggle.
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:22:57] It's by grace.
[1:23:01] Set your wings
[1:23:05] to the winds of faith. Verse two.
[1:23:09] Oh, what's your need?
[1:23:13] And what's your cry
[1:23:17] and what's your mountain
[1:23:22] to high?
[1:23:25] Speak the word of God
[1:23:29] and by and by
[1:23:34] it will move
[1:23:37] or you will fly.
[1:23:42] Set your wings
[1:23:45] to the wings of faith.
[1:23:50] You can fly
[1:23:53] in a higher place.
[1:23:58] Do not struggle.
[1:24:02] It's by grace.
[1:24:06] Set your wings
[1:24:09] to the winds of faith.
[1:24:12] A beautiful song
[1:24:14] inspired
[1:24:16] written by the hand of brother Josai's
[1:24:19] dad.
[1:24:22] Friends,
[1:24:24] I pray that these Bible studies, I pray
[1:24:27] that they're a blessing to you.
[1:24:30] They teach us lessons for today. I truly
[1:24:35] do not believe that God would record the
[1:24:39] things that he recorded. I don't believe
[1:24:42] it if it was not for us to read and for
[1:24:45] us to be inspired by, for us to be
[1:24:49] corrected by, and for us to be warned
[1:24:53] by.
[1:24:55] Saul
[1:24:57] had
[1:25:00] weaknesses
[1:25:02] that many of us have. I'd say all of us.
[1:25:06] Saul was one that is a very, very good
[1:25:08] example
[1:25:10] of a man that was full of weaknesses
[1:25:12] that we can relate to. Take these
[1:25:16] scriptures, take these stories, apply
[1:25:20] them, apply them to your life, and just
[1:25:23] thank the Lord. Lord, I'm thankful that
[1:25:26] I don't have to suffer like Saul
[1:25:28] suffered and that the people around me
[1:25:31] don't have to suffer like the people
[1:25:33] around Saul had to suffer because of my
[1:25:36] bad decisions.
[1:25:38] Amen. Let's pray. Father, we're
[1:25:41] grateful. Thank you for your word, Lord.
[1:25:45] Thank you for what you've done for us,
[1:25:47] for preserving this this Bible.
[1:25:51] And Lord, we pray that we could take a a
[1:25:54] lesson or two that was learned tonight
[1:25:56] and that it would stay in our hearts and
[1:25:58] stay in our minds. And Lord, that we
[1:26:00] would make good decisions in the future.
[1:26:03] Decisions that consult you, oh God.
[1:26:07] And Lord, you're so much more available
[1:26:09] now
[1:26:11] than you were back then.
[1:26:14] Lord, your son came
[1:26:18] and died for our sins.
[1:26:21] and made a promise that the comforter
[1:26:24] would come.
[1:26:27] And then that day
[1:26:30] we call the day of Pentecost.
[1:26:34] Lord, the promise of that comforter was
[1:26:36] made manifest at 120 in the upper room.
[1:26:40] And then Lord, by the words of your
[1:26:43] apostle Peter,
[1:26:46] Lord, you gave us a promise that we
[1:26:48] might also receive that comforter,
[1:26:50] that we might receive the gift of the
[1:26:52] Holy Spirit.
[1:26:54] Lord, we're so grateful that we live in
[1:26:57] this day now. That you've chosen us to
[1:27:00] live here.
[1:27:02] That Lord, your Holy Spirit is is so
[1:27:05] available
[1:27:07] if we would just dedicate our lives and
[1:27:09] if we would just surrender to you. May
[1:27:12] it be so, Lord.
[1:27:14] Pray that everyone here
[1:27:17] would truly surrender.
[1:27:22] Lord, help us to be right in our minds,
[1:27:25] see our faults,
[1:27:28] confess them,
[1:27:30] and then Lord, we pray that when we make
[1:27:33] that effort, Lord, that your spirit
[1:27:35] would come in and help us, Father, to
[1:27:39] conquer
[1:27:41] these WS and these these darts of the
[1:27:44] enemy. Protect us, Lord. Strengthen us.
[1:27:49] And Lord, may your Holy Spirit reign for
[1:27:52] reign supreme in our lives.
[1:27:56] May we go forward,
[1:27:59] the power, the demonstration of the Holy
[1:28:01] Spirit
[1:28:03] as our Lord Jesus command.
[1:28:06] Granted, Father, may your will be done
[1:28:08] in our lives in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:28:14] I have a guest speaker on Sunday,
[1:28:18] Brother Ryan Long, friend of mine, good
[1:28:21] brother. We're all familiar with him.
[1:28:23] He'll be speaking on Sunday morning. So,
[1:28:26] pray for service this week. And um I
[1:28:30] appreciate Brother Ryan. I trust him.
[1:28:33] He's not only I believe he's he's a uh a
[1:28:38] good minister, but he's also a good
[1:28:39] friend.
[1:28:40] So, please keep that in prayer this
[1:28:42] week. And uh may God be with each one of
[1:28:46] you. Stand strong. Remember,
[1:28:50] if I could choose any day
[1:28:52] in all of history to live, I would
[1:28:55] choose this day.
[1:28:58] This is the day that that I believe the
[1:29:02] second coming of Christ will be known.
[1:29:06] And I want to see him. Do you want to
[1:29:08] see him when he returns?
[1:29:11] I would rather see him in his second
[1:29:14] coming
[1:29:16] when he comes in all of his glory with
[1:29:17] his angels with him and he takes us out
[1:29:20] of this world. I would rather see him in
[1:29:22] this day
[1:29:24] because this will be the day that it's
[1:29:26] all wiped clean. Amen. God bless you,
[1:29:29] brothers and sisters. You're dismissed.
[1:29:33] Have faith in God.
[1:29:43] Have
[1:29:45] faith
[1:29:47] in God.

[1:33:26] bonds of Satan that so they they bind
[1:33:30] us. They put us down. They shackle us
[1:33:34] with with these weights that we should
[1:33:38] not have.
[1:33:39] that song. I I I've heard that song ever
[1:33:42] since I was a baby. The random liked it
[1:33:45] and it's always just every time we see

[1:37:23] Spirit's nice, isn't it? Such a sweet
[1:37:26] spirit.
[1:37:27] Sometimes he goes into battle.
[1:37:30] Sometimes he shakes the earth.
[1:37:33] Sometimes he destroys our enemies.
[1:37:37] And then sometimes it's just a sweet,
[1:37:40] quiet spirit.
[1:37:42] He's God. He uses many ways.
[1:37:46] He uh the power of God is is great and
[1:37:49] it's not always loud and it's not always
[1:37:51] shouting.
[1:37:53] Brother Random said one time, he said,
[1:37:56] "The power of God." He said, "Do you
[1:37:57] ever hear the sunrise?"
[1:38:00] There's a lot of power in the sun rising
[1:38:04] and yet it's quiet. It's sweet before
[1:38:07] the Lord. And other times, we're to blow
[1:38:09] trumpets and then walls come down. He's
[1:38:11] just good. He's good. Friends, I do
[1:38:15] believe that he was with us tonight. I I
[1:38:17] really believe that. And I believe that
[1:38:20] he answered prayers tonight. I don't
[1:38:22] know which ones, but I believe that he
[1:38:26] was pleased with our service. I believed
[1:38:27] he was pre pleased with our worship. So,
[1:38:31] as you go,
[1:38:33] as you go, rejoice with God. Thank him.
