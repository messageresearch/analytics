[43:51] you certainly good to be here back
[43:53] gathered with god's people amen and i
[43:56] just
[43:57] believe
[43:58] that there's a purpose in our heart
[44:00] there's a reason that we gather the
[44:02] bible says that we should do it more as
[44:04] we see the day approaching we should
[44:07] assemble ourselves so we're here tonight
[44:09] the lord of jesus is here and that's all
[44:12] that matters amen romans chapter 7 i
[44:14] just want to say again amen it's a
[44:17] privilege to be here with you and i
[44:18] trust that the lord spoke to you and
[44:21] something was said that blessed you and
[44:23] so we just like to continue from where
[44:25] we left off tonight brother matthew i'll
[44:28] start at slide 13 i said 23 but we'll go
[44:31] to that after slide 13. let's just begin
[44:34] uh with romans 7 we've read it this
[44:36] morning but i just want to pick it up uh
[44:38] just one more time amen i'd like to just
[44:41] continue this being changed and this
[44:43] will just be where we left off let's
[44:45] just begin reading here at verse 20
[44:48] uh 21. i find that a law
[44:51] that when i would do good
[44:54] evil is present with me
[44:56] for i delight in the law of god
[44:58] after the inward man
[45:00] but i see another law in my members
[45:04] warring against the law of my mind and
[45:07] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[45:09] sin which is in my members o wretched
[45:12] man that i am
[45:13] who shall deliver me from the body of
[45:15] this death
[45:16] and i say with paul i thank god
[45:19] through jesus christ our lord
[45:22] so then with the mind i myself serve the
[45:25] law of god but with the flesh
[45:28] the law of sin lord we're grateful to be
[45:30] here one more time with you lord and
[45:33] just believing that
[45:35] you're
[45:36] lord the need meter you're the speaker
[45:39] you're the great physician
[45:40] you're the healer of our hearts our
[45:42] redeemer
[45:44] lord your everything that we need in
[45:46] this journey of life
[45:47] lord and we've come to this service here
[45:49] tonight just
[45:51] needing one more drink from your water
[45:54] lord i pray that we would have hungry
[45:56] hearts thirsty hearts and we could just
[45:58] say lord i pray that we would be able to
[46:00] move everything aside all of the
[46:03] thoughts aside everything that would
[46:04] distract us and help us lord jesus just
[46:07] to hear from you this evening i pray it
[46:10] bless each person that gathered here
[46:11] tonight those that will by archive or
[46:14] live stream i pray god that you would
[46:16] just be near to them now we ask it in
[46:18] the name of jesus christ amen you can be
[46:21] seated
[46:24] you love jesus
[46:26] amen praise the lord i just want to pick
[46:29] up just right from where we left off and
[46:31] we've got just uh something we did we
[46:33] wanted to
[46:34] get to and so i just feel like the lord
[46:37] just still has this uh this thought here
[46:40] to express so let's just pick up right
[46:42] where we left off and i came back to
[46:45] this slide and i want to read it with
[46:46] you again
[46:47] prophet of god says and sometimes we
[46:49] find that people going through these
[46:51] prayer lines out across the nations and
[46:53] they just run up and think that the lord
[46:57] ought to heal them right then
[46:59] but there is something maybe down in
[47:02] there and we set before the lord until
[47:05] he reveals that what that is
[47:08] there is something god and notice how he
[47:10] says this there's a reason
[47:13] for everything i want you just to
[47:15] remember that here tonight as we
[47:17] minister there's a reason for everything
[47:20] so brother baron begins to tell how that
[47:22] people would come through the prayer
[47:23] line and just think there we go that's
[47:25] it i have this condition i have this
[47:28] issue i have this disease
[47:30] however physical it was but the prophet
[47:32] of god understood that sometimes there's
[47:36] a spiritual connection between what you
[47:39] see outwardly or naturally jesus would
[47:42] see the same exact thing he would take a
[47:44] man and he would pray for him and he
[47:47] would lay his hands upon him and speak
[47:49] and that man was healed there was other
[47:51] times when he would pray he would take
[47:53] and spit in the dirt and pick up the
[47:55] dirt and ball it up in the mud and rub
[47:58] it on the man's eyes and then the man
[48:00] was ill you say why
[48:01] was there a difference because there was
[48:03] jesus could see there was a connection
[48:06] maybe deeper than what you or i could
[48:08] see physically on the outside paul
[48:11] begins to say this that inside of me and
[48:14] he says that is in my flesh
[48:16] there's nothing good
[48:18] but he says but after there's another
[48:20] part of me an inward man that loves the
[48:24] lord with all of my heart
[48:27] and how to connect those two how to put
[48:29] those two together now listen to what
[48:30] brother branham says there's a reason
[48:32] for everything
[48:34] and you've got to find the reason first
[48:37] and then you could find what to work on
[48:40] so the prophet is saying sometimes
[48:42] there's an outward cause whether it was
[48:45] a heart trouble or a nervous condition
[48:47] or whatever disease it was
[48:49] and he says but yet there's something
[48:52] that's connected to that
[48:54] maybe down inside of there maybe down on
[48:58] the inside of there there's a reason
[49:00] that you see that
[49:02] and sometimes what we find is one person
[49:05] can get delivered from something
[49:07] just by the prayer of faith they accept
[49:10] it they accept the word of god god comes
[49:12] down and they're delivered and then you
[49:14] watch other people and that battle just
[49:16] seems to drag out and drag out and drag
[49:19] out and they're months and they're
[49:21] asking for the same exact need and you
[49:23] wonder where is the struggle well
[49:25] sometimes the prophet says there's
[49:28] something deeper something on another
[49:31] level and you've got to find the reason
[49:35] for it now let's pick up slide 23. let's
[49:37] just follow this along and i love this
[49:40] um the these messages that he cares do
[49:43] you care and or we're going to read from
[49:44] let's i think we said 23 brother
[49:47] brother matthew
[49:48] he says coming uh that was where we we
[49:50] stopped and let's just begin let's just
[49:53] look at 23 and just the very end of it
[49:55] he says here and the prophet of god says
[49:57] a few minutes to find himself
[50:00] and here they sit right here this
[50:02] morning sitting in the audience see how
[50:04] satan was trying to upset that young man
[50:06] by referring to him of some complex to
[50:08] be built back which the holy spirit knew
[50:12] and i seen it by the vision of the lord
[50:14] and i love this but god cared for that
[50:17] man god cared for that young boy
[50:22] so the prophet says here it's just
[50:24] coming in a few moments ago this is he
[50:27] cares do you care uh just coming in a
[50:30] few moments ago a lady see her sitting
[50:32] here in the aisle just got her seat
[50:34] someway and sat down she said nine years
[50:37] brother branham i've tried to get a hold
[50:40] of you she said i'm so desperate
[50:43] i'm here late i couldn't even get a
[50:45] prayer card to be in the line the lady
[50:47] moved back she said brother branham just
[50:50] a word with you
[50:52] standing there a vision broke over this
[50:54] fine looking young woman
[50:57] sorry didn't advance it standing there a
[50:59] vision broke over this fine looking
[51:01] young woman and see that her heart was
[51:04] burdened and she was trying to work to
[51:07] make a living and a great thing happened
[51:10] way back in the time of her parents
[51:13] so the prophet points all the way back
[51:15] here's this woman she's trying to reach
[51:17] the prophet of god i've got this
[51:18] condition nine years i've came to you
[51:21] and my heart is so burdened and brother
[51:23] branham says she was trying to work to
[51:24] make a living and he says and a great
[51:26] thing happened way back in the time of
[51:28] her parents that it caused this great
[51:32] thing to happen to her
[51:34] so something in her past even before her
[51:40] and now it was affecting
[51:42] her presently
[51:43] and he says and the lord jesus revealed
[51:46] it and showed what it was and there in a
[51:50] moment's time
[51:52] took it from the woman
[51:55] she went around rejoicing and now
[51:57] sitting here in the audience with us now
[51:59] rejoicing with tears as she continues
[52:02] wiping her eyes now
[52:04] knowing that the truth of the thing was
[52:07] made known
[52:08] and that what that poor little neurotic
[52:11] woman that was so nervous she didn't
[52:14] know what to do with herself notice and
[52:17] thinking that she was gone and there was
[52:19] no holy spirit and this is her last day
[52:23] if you've ever had that thought you're
[52:25] not the only one
[52:27] and he says she was little neurotic
[52:29] woman thinking there was no holy spirit
[52:31] this is her last day she had tried for
[52:34] nine years and she was about at the end
[52:37] of despair
[52:39] god
[52:40] cared for that little woman who no one
[52:43] cares for
[52:45] love that the prophet of god uses these
[52:48] examples uses these testimonies and the
[52:50] message he cares do you care
[52:54] brother branham says god cared for that
[52:56] little woman who no one cares for what a
[52:59] time
[53:00] he does care
[53:02] when he was here on earth
[53:05] and i say brother adam says when he was
[53:07] here on earth as i say he cared for the
[53:09] people so much
[53:11] until he healed their sick comforted
[53:14] their hearts told them about a place
[53:16] where he would go and prepare for them
[53:18] and would come again to receive them
[53:20] unto himself he cared for them and
[53:22] notice he cared so much until when he
[53:25] knowed he must leave in order to bring
[53:27] this great thing to us he said i'll not
[53:30] leave you comfortless but i will send
[53:32] the holy spirit and he shall continue my
[53:36] care for you until he returns there's no
[53:39] one cares like jesus
[53:42] you say brother matt we don't have a
[53:43] prophet here to sit down in a private
[53:45] interview with a gift to go over my life
[53:47] and to discern what took place
[53:49] as i was younger maybe in the time of my
[53:52] parents but here's what promise we may
[53:54] not have that but here's what we do have
[53:56] the same jesus that cared for that
[53:58] little woman cares for you tonight
[54:02] are you thankful for that
[54:04] he says there's no one cares like jesus
[54:07] and knowing
[54:08] that he sent back the holy spirit to
[54:11] continue to comfort his people does he
[54:15] care
[54:16] certainly he cares
[54:18] now he was to continue care for the
[54:20] people his people here on earth in the
[54:23] same manner that he cared for them
[54:25] when he was here so the prophet of god
[54:28] begins to give this example how that
[54:30] there was
[54:31] something in her past even in the time
[54:34] of her parents you remember brother
[54:36] branham tells the story of this woman
[54:38] and i don't have it here on the slides
[54:39] but brother madam tells the story of
[54:41] this woman who came through the prayer
[54:42] line and she has heart trouble same
[54:45] exact as the woman we read earlier she's
[54:47] suffering with some condition and
[54:49] brother branham goes on to say hell that
[54:51] the number one thing that troubles uh
[54:54] the world today and i i looked this up
[54:57] about a month ago when i
[54:59] ministered this and it's statistically
[55:01] the same exact thing the number almost
[55:04] the number one as the prophet said
[55:06] almost the number one medical trouble in
[55:09] the uni in the planet not just the
[55:11] united states not just the nation and
[55:13] the planet is heart disease
[55:16] heart trouble and heart issues and heart
[55:19] problems
[55:20] because so much and doctors are finding
[55:23] out now what a kentucky hillbilly told
[55:25] us back in the 60s
[55:26] that stress and the neurotic age and
[55:29] conditions lead an anxiety lead to heart
[55:33] trouble
[55:34] and if you remove this the can if you
[55:37] remove the the stress and you lower your
[55:40] level of anxiety and your level of worry
[55:43] you can sometimes cure disease
[55:47] and we have a doctor back home and would
[55:49] he would testify to that that so much of
[55:51] the trouble is the amount of pressure
[55:54] that people are under it's causing
[55:57] physical pressure that's maybe in your
[55:59] mind or in your spiritual in a spirit
[56:01] realm is causing physical diseases
[56:07] remember there's more to you than what
[56:09] you see in the mirror
[56:12] there's more to you than what the doctor
[56:14] in the hospital or the er or the
[56:16] specialist can work on
[56:19] now you say brother mighty against the
[56:21] doctors absolutely not brother branham
[56:23] called them god's agents
[56:25] and so we're all for medical i'm
[56:27] thankful very grateful today for medical
[56:29] science saved my dad's life
[56:32] jesus ultimately is the healer but god
[56:34] uses the agents of men and medicine and
[56:37] knowledge
[56:39] to bring healing to people
[56:41] now healing can only take place by the
[56:44] lord
[56:45] outside of that it's just mechanics
[56:47] you're still working on the body so
[56:48] there's things that the doctor the
[56:50] specialist
[56:52] can't see his tools are not designed
[56:56] to touch those parts his tools are not
[56:58] designed to expose those parts but
[57:01] there's a physician that we know that
[57:03] can
[57:04] brother adam tells the story of this
[57:06] woman and he begins to tell how hard
[57:07] trouble's the number one outside of
[57:09] cancer is one of the most not no one of
[57:11] the the most diseases that's affecting
[57:14] more people than any other and brother
[57:16] adam begins to tell of this woman and
[57:18] she has this condition
[57:20] and he looks at her and he begins to
[57:21] discern and he and he's he says now you
[57:23] have heart heart trouble heart disease
[57:25] she said yes that's right brother
[57:26] branham and the prophet begins to look
[57:28] back down breaks in division goes all
[57:31] the way back to the time she was a
[57:32] little i think eight nine something like
[57:35] that year old girl and she walks out of
[57:38] her home leaves her driveway going to
[57:40] her neighbor's house and a dog runs out
[57:42] of the next house and begins to chase
[57:44] her and she starts running running
[57:46] panicking for her life and the brother
[57:49] branham says it was from that moment
[57:51] trauma came in your life and you were so
[57:53] fearful and now you've lived your entire
[57:56] life with the physical condition because
[57:58] of that moment you were chased by a dog
[58:03] now listen as we said brother branham
[58:06] says there's more to you than what meets
[58:09] the eye there's more paul says there's
[58:11] two of me
[58:12] living inside of me
[58:14] and the prophet says and i didn't put it
[58:16] on the screen but we quoted it this
[58:17] morning that's what's wrong with so many
[58:20] blowed up christians like a boiler and
[58:23] he said that flu gets clogged up and
[58:24] they never clean out the channels and
[58:26] then we have an explosion and he says
[58:29] but believers that's what's wrong with
[58:30] so many blowed up christians they never
[58:33] clean out the memory they never clean
[58:35] out the conscience they never clean out
[58:37] the imagination the affection
[58:41] say brother matt what are you saying i'm
[58:42] saying that you should spend every day
[58:44] of your life and say lord purge my mind
[58:47] purge my spirit purge my thoughts
[58:51] free me of any thought the bible says it
[58:54] this way cast down any thought or vain
[58:57] imagination that exalts itself above
[59:00] what this word says
[59:03] cast it down
[59:05] and so you can take things you can
[59:07] ingest even through covid and people
[59:10] that never got sick with covet in a
[59:12] serious way but they ingested fear in
[59:16] such a level that it's affected them
[59:18] today and how they live yet they never
[59:20] were seriously ill with covet
[59:22] but the fear that came with that
[59:24] pandemic
[59:26] caused more trouble than any disease or
[59:28] sickness that kova ever could imagine to
[59:30] do to that person
[59:33] because it in you ingest that into your
[59:35] and you say brother matt well i'm not
[59:37] fearful well i may not name
[59:39] as i say here tonight i may not name
[59:41] your this specific uh issue here tonight
[59:44] with the words that i use but just
[59:46] remember as we preach today these things
[59:48] are spirits
[59:50] and the way that a spirit gets access is
[59:54] the access that you give him
[1:00:00] you could take a complex you could take
[1:00:02] something and the devil let me say this
[1:00:04] this way
[1:00:05] satan has sold
[1:00:07] believers more believers more
[1:00:11] i call it this phantom pain you know
[1:00:13] what phantom pain is
[1:00:15] someone goes into the into the uh into
[1:00:18] the er and they've got it they've got
[1:00:19] they've they've got pain yet nothing's
[1:00:21] wrong with them the doctor back home one
[1:00:23] of our brothers who's in the er he says
[1:00:25] he gives out more placebos
[1:00:28] than he does real medicine
[1:00:32] to people who will actually just in
[1:00:33] their mind because they're in such a
[1:00:35] neurotic state let me say that satan has
[1:00:37] sold more christians
[1:00:39] phantom pain of how hurt i am or this
[1:00:42] person's talking about me and they're
[1:00:43] thinking this and that's why they did
[1:00:45] this and they've just got an agenda and
[1:00:47] that person maybe has no idea about any
[1:00:49] of your pain that you think that they're
[1:00:51] causing you and they have nothing to do
[1:00:53] with it whatsoever but you've believed a
[1:00:56] lie of the devil and now you've acted
[1:00:58] and reacted as though that person has
[1:01:00] done something and they may not have a
[1:01:01] clue
[1:01:05] well it's the truth anyhow
[1:01:08] and this person comes against this
[1:01:10] person and this group over here and then
[1:01:12] the entire time there's not really ever
[1:01:14] was really an issue but you you begin to
[1:01:17] your reality uh your your perception is
[1:01:19] reality
[1:01:21] and the prophet of god even begins to
[1:01:23] speak of this and he and i just want to
[1:01:25] take a moment to read this
[1:01:27] he begins to tell this and let's just
[1:01:29] look at it here together he tells about
[1:01:31] something that happened to him in the
[1:01:33] message standing in the gap
[1:01:35] and brother bannon begins to tell about
[1:01:37] this dream that brother roy uh has and
[1:01:41] brother branham says that he has this
[1:01:43] dream of him
[1:01:44] and the lord woke him up and and i just
[1:01:47] want maybe we'll just take time just to
[1:01:48] read it here let's just read it together
[1:01:50] one night the lord woke him up one
[1:01:52] morning we're sitting here and i looked
[1:01:53] like in jerusalem at the lord's
[1:01:55] communion table and i was talking he
[1:01:57] couldn't understand it brother roy set
[1:01:59] him present looking at me right now he
[1:02:01] saw it he called me up in houston or out
[1:02:04] in arizona sent me a letter and i called
[1:02:06] him back he said you were sitting there
[1:02:07] brother branham
[1:02:09] and i saw that big pillar of light come
[1:02:12] in notice and get you and take you away
[1:02:16] from the lord's table and you went
[1:02:18] westward cause he was sitting on the
[1:02:20] east side watching me go west
[1:02:23] and he says and this light come in
[1:02:26] and taken me out
[1:02:28] said it was one morning like it was a
[1:02:29] vision got up in bed about three or four
[1:02:31] o'clock in the morning something like
[1:02:33] that saw this happen and he said he
[1:02:35] screamed looked like for days brother
[1:02:37] bill
[1:02:37] come back
[1:02:39] roy and i have been real brothers we
[1:02:40] lived together hunt together and we're
[1:02:42] just brothers and he screamed for me
[1:02:44] until he was hoarse in his throat come
[1:02:47] back
[1:02:48] bring him back bring him back crying he
[1:02:50] said here come that pillar of fire
[1:02:53] coming back or a cloud come back and he
[1:02:55] set me at the head of the table
[1:02:58] notice
[1:02:59] and i had been changed
[1:03:02] it was a mystery to brother brother roy
[1:03:06] me being changed this is where i got the
[1:03:08] title for this message being changed it
[1:03:11] was a mystery to brother roy me
[1:03:15] being changed
[1:03:17] to look
[1:03:18] different
[1:03:20] and brother branham takes out a piece of
[1:03:21] paper and he and he takes just a little
[1:03:24] sticky and he and he writes a little
[1:03:26] note on that sticky and then he places
[1:03:28] it up on the up on the platform and it
[1:03:31] for his for his memory he says i lay
[1:03:33] this up here for something i want to
[1:03:35] remember
[1:03:36] being changed when i give him the
[1:03:39] interpretation of it now i know where
[1:03:41] your minds immediately go as you read
[1:03:42] the message that this is surely some
[1:03:45] mysterious thing that brother branham
[1:03:47] gives maybe it's about the opening of
[1:03:49] the seals or that you know the something
[1:03:51] that brother adam's going to preach on
[1:03:52] the trumpets or it was a vision but i
[1:03:54] want you to notice actually what this
[1:03:57] dream was about when brother branham
[1:03:58] says brother roy notice me he says he
[1:04:01] sent me the pillar of fire comes in the
[1:04:03] room takes brother branham pulls brother
[1:04:06] branham out of the lord's table
[1:04:08] takes him from his seat
[1:04:10] and then brother brother roy says then
[1:04:12] brother branham that light came in
[1:04:15] the holy spirit comes in the room and he
[1:04:17] sets you at the head of the table but
[1:04:19] you were different you looked different
[1:04:21] you were changed
[1:04:24] now let's look at what that change
[1:04:26] was
[1:04:28] that brother branham writes that sticky
[1:04:30] note and he writes it down listen to
[1:04:32] this
[1:04:33] prophet of god says now i'm preaching to
[1:04:35] myself
[1:04:36] could we stand and see a human being
[1:04:38] that's blind now brother branham tells
[1:04:40] us here this is uh this this what we
[1:04:42] just read here is prior and then he goes
[1:04:44] into his sermon standing in the gap
[1:04:47] i'm preaching this to myself could we
[1:04:48] stand and see a human being that's blind
[1:04:50] physically blind
[1:04:52] and know that he was walking over a
[1:04:54] cliff
[1:04:55] could we
[1:04:56] in our stall state of mind that we're in
[1:04:59] this morning
[1:05:01] pretty honest
[1:05:03] could we stand and see a blind man
[1:05:06] walk over a cliff blind
[1:05:08] and not try to warn him
[1:05:11] it would be
[1:05:12] would be so cruel
[1:05:15] we would be so
[1:05:17] indifferent
[1:05:19] in our heart
[1:05:21] now brother branham
[1:05:22] tells us here in a moment
[1:05:24] he's speaking about himself
[1:05:28] and he says i became so
[1:05:30] cold and indifferent
[1:05:33] in my heart could you see a blind man
[1:05:36] know he was going to walk over a cliff
[1:05:38] and not warn him
[1:05:39] brother branham says we would be so
[1:05:41] indifferent in our heart could you
[1:05:43] imagine a person getting so indifferent
[1:05:47] that he could almost laugh and see a
[1:05:49] blind man that cannot see and can't help
[1:05:51] himself deliberately walk over a cliff
[1:05:54] that would be a bad thing
[1:05:56] do nothing about it well to my brethren
[1:05:59] world over i want to make this
[1:06:01] confession
[1:06:04] he says i want to make this confession i
[1:06:06] humbly say it that that
[1:06:09] just about what i was doing
[1:06:12] or fixing to do
[1:06:14] i had been preaching for years you say
[1:06:16] how did brother branham get to such a
[1:06:18] place
[1:06:19] now here's god's prophet
[1:06:22] but remember he's a man just like you
[1:06:26] just like me
[1:06:27] he's made up of memory conscience reason
[1:06:29] imagination affection emotion
[1:06:32] now the prophet of god says you could
[1:06:35] get so indifferent and so cold in your
[1:06:37] heart
[1:06:39] that you would look at someone and
[1:06:40] brother adam says now brothers i want to
[1:06:42] confess that that's about how i was i
[1:06:44] had gotten so calloused and so cold in
[1:06:47] my heart
[1:06:49] not in his soul where he's born of the
[1:06:51] spirit of god where he's living in an
[1:06:53] eternal day he's been translated he's a
[1:06:55] new creature in christ but in his spirit
[1:06:58] he became so bitter and so hardened
[1:07:01] towards people brother brandon begins to
[1:07:03] tell i've been preaching for years i've
[1:07:06] become an old man and an old veteran
[1:07:07] preacher and had a lot of hard battles
[1:07:10] and maybe i'm scarred all cut up on the
[1:07:13] inside from fights
[1:07:15] because my lot that the lord gave me was
[1:07:17] not to kiss the babies and marry the
[1:07:20] young and bury the old but it was to
[1:07:22] hold a two-headed two-handed sword at
[1:07:25] the battlefront against the wiles of
[1:07:26] paganism and demonology and the powers
[1:07:29] of darkness and fight it with the word
[1:07:31] of god till i seen the enemy defeated
[1:07:37] i've been cut deep
[1:07:40] many times
[1:07:45] now ahmed a man was a christian he's got
[1:07:47] a great country right under alaska and i
[1:07:49] made him made up my mind that
[1:07:52] being that i had left here and going
[1:07:54] west that i would take my wife
[1:07:57] and kind of
[1:07:59] trap her into something
[1:08:01] any of you brother's ever done that you
[1:08:03] know just trap her don't tell her just
[1:08:06] sort of his brother adam says i'm gonna
[1:08:08] just get her up there and get my wife up
[1:08:09] there and
[1:08:10] sort of you know then reveal to her why
[1:08:12] i brought her there
[1:08:14] uh oh oh y'all don't do that i know you
[1:08:16] don't here in arizona
[1:08:18] i get her up here and i become a guide
[1:08:19] and then the lord wanted me to do
[1:08:21] something listen
[1:08:22] i'd let my hair grow out
[1:08:25] my whiskers and i'd go back there and be
[1:08:27] a guy there's only two or three indians
[1:08:29] live back in the country there i'd just
[1:08:30] be a guide i'd help bud and if the lord
[1:08:32] would wanted me to do anything i'd say
[1:08:34] all right lord give me a vision i would
[1:08:35] slip on out and he says then i be a
[1:08:38] nervous you will not find
[1:08:41] and here's what i just want to stop here
[1:08:42] and say i am so thankful that we didn't
[1:08:45] have just a sage on the stage we didn't
[1:08:48] have a man with pride that was so
[1:08:50] indignant he could never be transparent
[1:08:52] but we had a prophet who could be so
[1:08:54] honest with us
[1:08:56] so that you can relate and i can relate
[1:08:58] and say i'm the same built the same
[1:09:00] exact way as he was
[1:09:03] and brother branham is going to become
[1:09:05] you won't find him being more honest and
[1:09:07] transparent that i find than you will in
[1:09:10] this message standing in the gap listen
[1:09:12] what brother branham says here he says
[1:09:13] then i being nervous i say this kind of
[1:09:16] quietly maybe a neurotically type of
[1:09:18] person that i am
[1:09:19] knowing that i was insufficient at the
[1:09:23] beginning for the job
[1:09:28] here's what a man here's what brother
[1:09:29] branham could tell you about himself
[1:09:31] knowing that in myself
[1:09:33] i'm insufficient for the job
[1:09:37] for the job as many has complained that
[1:09:39] had to do it was hard but i thought god
[1:09:41] why didn't you just call somebody that
[1:09:42] could have done it i'm sorry
[1:09:45] but i failed
[1:09:47] the people just won't listen to me
[1:09:49] and i failed to do what i should have
[1:09:51] done somewhere because they won't listen
[1:09:54] my mother that's just passed on to glory
[1:09:56] about a little over a year ago my mother
[1:09:58] father was a hunter i think i got all
[1:10:01] that come out from him in that stand
[1:10:03] because i love the woods i thought if
[1:10:04] this people that call themselves
[1:10:07] christians if they don't want to listen
[1:10:09] to the message that i'm preaching then
[1:10:10] let them alone i'll just stop all
[1:10:13] together and i'll go up into the
[1:10:14] mountain
[1:10:16] and i know a friend to where before
[1:10:18] leaving here i might drop this in we'll
[1:10:20] hurry i dreamed a funny dream an odd
[1:10:23] dream i hope when my brother-in-law gets
[1:10:25] a hold of this it doesn't hurt his
[1:10:26] feelings i hope it don't hurt my wife
[1:10:28] who's sitting present now but she knows
[1:10:30] it about many months ago right on around
[1:10:34] about october november i dreamed that i
[1:10:36] was roaming out in the dark and well i
[1:10:39] had no place to go and nobody cared for
[1:10:41] me and i had become a bum just a bum and
[1:10:45] i was cold and i looked in the distance
[1:10:47] i saw a fire
[1:10:49] and when i got over there it was a city
[1:10:50] dump and they had ditches and the fire
[1:10:52] was in these ditches between the ditches
[1:10:54] was slick where bums would sleep there
[1:10:56] to keep warm keep from freezing between
[1:10:58] these fires on a cold winter night and i
[1:11:00] was cold i walked up to this fire to get
[1:11:03] warm and it was laying full of bums i
[1:11:05] didn't see any of them but they like had
[1:11:07] stalls or places where their sleeping
[1:11:09] place was and i saw my brother-in-law
[1:11:12] fletcher broy when i woke up before i
[1:11:14] woke up fletch said to me he said in the
[1:11:16] dream he said billy i'll hunt for you a
[1:11:18] place brother bill you fed my children
[1:11:21] and they were hungry and said you was a
[1:11:22] daddy to them now i'll find you a place
[1:11:25] here to keep warm and we went by walking
[1:11:28] by the bums places and finally come to a
[1:11:30] place he said i'll sit down here and
[1:11:33] i'll walk up here and see if i could
[1:11:35] find a place i walked and looked out
[1:11:36] into the dark cold night and i thought
[1:11:39] think of it
[1:11:40] one time
[1:11:42] god almighty let me lead his church
[1:11:44] one time he let me preach his gospel and
[1:11:47] see souls saved men and women come from
[1:11:50] around the world to speak with a few
[1:11:52] speak with for me for a few minutes and
[1:11:54] here i am now a bum
[1:11:57] and nobody wants me and i'm cold what
[1:12:01] must i do
[1:12:02] then i woke up
[1:12:04] i told my wife i said
[1:12:06] maybe it means fletcher's in need so we
[1:12:08] hurried up to see if we could find him
[1:12:10] his brother found him i come back down
[1:12:12] from canada with fred and them the other
[1:12:14] day and in my mind now notice this
[1:12:16] notice remember he's three parts
[1:12:18] he's a he's a person there's two of him
[1:12:21] listen to what brother adam says here
[1:12:22] and in my mind not the lord the lord
[1:12:25] didn't tell him that not in his soul
[1:12:27] but in my mind i had made up if these
[1:12:31] people don't want to hear my message
[1:12:33] they didn't have to i had preached now
[1:12:35] for about 35 years in the last 15 to 18
[1:12:38] years i've done nothing but just to the
[1:12:41] lord i've tried to live so close to him
[1:12:43] and not say a word till he told me first
[1:12:45] everything then i come down from canada
[1:12:47] and fred told her brother roy told me
[1:12:49] his dream as he and i brother banks rode
[1:12:52] along together just before we separated
[1:12:55] and i say the people i've never regarded
[1:12:58] myself anybody knowing the people have
[1:12:59] said brother brandon the lord called you
[1:13:00] to be his prophet i've never regarded
[1:13:02] myself as that but i began to get the
[1:13:03] time that i was just i was about ready
[1:13:06] to do it to think well maybe i am if i
[1:13:08] am i'll live back in the wilderness if i
[1:13:10] look back in the wilderness then i'll be
[1:13:11] his prophet if he wants me to send me
[1:13:13] somewhere and while he's not using me
[1:13:15] then i'll sure to catch some fine fish
[1:13:16] and do things of course that was kind of
[1:13:19] a selfish attitude because i wanted to
[1:13:22] do that
[1:13:23] now it isn't just exactly the thing
[1:13:25] that's to do and now i had that made up
[1:13:28] my mind to do that so i got up about
[1:13:30] four o'clock got started driving billy
[1:13:33] was sleeping we went to a place i was
[1:13:34] thinking on my mind everybody's asleep
[1:13:37] and brother branham's just you know he's
[1:13:38] he's he's he's problem solving he's
[1:13:41] crunching this he's just thinking about
[1:13:43] what he could do and he said i was play
[1:13:44] thinking in my mind you know what one of
[1:13:46] these days as soon as i can get the wife
[1:13:48] up there i won't tell her what i'm going
[1:13:50] to do but i'd get up there and then i'm
[1:13:51] going to tell her i love this place so
[1:13:53] well no no need of us going anywhere
[1:13:55] let's just stay here and that's back
[1:13:57] from civilization 1100 miles from
[1:13:59] anywhere say
[1:14:00] way in the wilderness i thought won't
[1:14:02] that be fine i won't have to get a
[1:14:05] haircut
[1:14:08] now don't you nobody use that for
[1:14:09] justification to not get a haircut
[1:14:12] i won't have to dress up
[1:14:15] i'll just be a regular mountaineer
[1:14:17] what i always wanted to be
[1:14:21] and i said i got some guns and some
[1:14:23] people give me and i'll be a guide like
[1:14:25] you never heard of i'll just love it
[1:14:28] then the lord tells me to go and
[1:14:30] somebody's i'll run out and tell them
[1:14:31] and come back again and i'll help bud
[1:14:33] and we really have a place here
[1:14:35] i love how brother branham says this
[1:14:38] i was thinking on that
[1:14:40] i was really pondering that that's a
[1:14:42] good thought man
[1:14:44] what a life
[1:14:45] now remember
[1:14:47] he's not saying i wanna you know he's
[1:14:50] not pondering to go sit in a bar
[1:14:52] somewhere he's not pondering to go
[1:14:54] backslide on the lord he's not pondering
[1:14:56] to give up on the lord or just just he's
[1:14:58] gotten so hurt and so scarred no what
[1:15:01] he's pondering is just a little detour
[1:15:06] and you know oftentimes
[1:15:07] if we're not careful we we succumb to
[1:15:09] the pressure and rather than staying on
[1:15:11] the path that god's given us we we
[1:15:14] really think on a detour you know i'll
[1:15:16] still serve the lord
[1:15:19] but you never know where that road's
[1:15:20] going to lead
[1:15:23] and it goes further and further and
[1:15:24] further and further away and brother
[1:15:26] brandon's rationalizing all this in his
[1:15:28] mind
[1:15:29] he says i was i was thinking on that
[1:15:33] it said
[1:15:34] carry out your plans
[1:15:36] and you'll be like that
[1:15:39] immediately brother brandon you imagine
[1:15:41] when that voice spoke
[1:15:43] carry out your plans
[1:15:45] and you'll be like that take that detour
[1:15:48] that you've justified and you've made it
[1:15:50] out in your mind well i've been hurt
[1:15:52] i've just been cut so many times and
[1:15:54] people have hurt me and they've they've
[1:15:55] just now listened if anybody ever had a
[1:15:58] good excuse
[1:16:00] if anybody ever had a good reason to
[1:16:03] take a detour it would have been god's
[1:16:04] prophet
[1:16:07] and now brother branham here you think
[1:16:08] he's not doing something it's it's just
[1:16:10] innocent he's just trying to escape the
[1:16:12] pressure and the lord speaks and says go
[1:16:14] ahead and do that you know that bum
[1:16:16] you'll end up just like that
[1:16:18] and listen what brother branham says
[1:16:20] here
[1:16:21] said
[1:16:22] the voice said your wife will go too she
[1:16:24] won't live up there in the hills like
[1:16:26] that and you'll become a bum
[1:16:29] just as the dream showed you you would
[1:16:32] i said
[1:16:33] i don't i don't want to be that i don't
[1:16:36] want to have to live like that i want to
[1:16:38] do something different i was told that
[1:16:39] you called me to be a prophet i want to
[1:16:41] live in the wilderness like the prophet
[1:16:43] but i was using my own excuse so i can
[1:16:46] hunt my own good
[1:16:49] i let the sick lay
[1:16:51] i want the lord to tell me where to go
[1:16:53] and not do that's wrong i had built my
[1:16:56] self
[1:16:57] a complex
[1:16:59] because the people didn't hear my
[1:17:01] message
[1:17:02] and if god forbid that i'll try to
[1:17:04] compare the life now of like moses but
[1:17:06] it's exactly what moses did that people
[1:17:08] wouldn't listen to him when he come to
[1:17:10] deliver them so he just left them alone
[1:17:12] and went in the wilderness but god
[1:17:13] turned him around and he had long forgot
[1:17:16] the suffering people
[1:17:18] now listen
[1:17:19] and these rickys and raketas that have
[1:17:22] so sassed the words
[1:17:24] and i've called them ricky and raketta
[1:17:28] god give me to understand i shouldn't do
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:33] because that's many of them are still
[1:17:35] his children
[1:17:39] so god corrects him and says you call
[1:17:41] them rickies and mercators you shouldn't
[1:17:43] do that
[1:17:45] they can't help because they act so much
[1:17:47] different some of these old cold formal
[1:17:49] churches has got them that spirit upon
[1:17:51] them
[1:17:52] they're in as much prison as israel was
[1:17:54] in prison just as much just as moses
[1:17:56] went down to deliver them from slavery
[1:17:58] slavery human beings that loved jesus
[1:18:01] christ would serve him if they only knew
[1:18:05] what to serve him by and they're in
[1:18:07] bondage under denominationalism that
[1:18:09] tells them don't do this and you don't
[1:18:10] do that but the call of god listen the
[1:18:13] call of god must come whoever wants to
[1:18:16] march towards the promised land let him
[1:18:18] march when i rode to the promised land
[1:18:19] let him come on our road to meet christ
[1:18:21] at the end time and i wanted to bring
[1:18:24] this to you so that you would see and
[1:18:27] show you that the mistake that a man can
[1:18:31] make yet being sincere
[1:18:38] a mistake that a man could make
[1:18:41] yet
[1:18:42] being
[1:18:43] sincere
[1:18:47] moses lost the feeling of his people
[1:18:49] because they wouldn't listen to him and
[1:18:51] brother roy
[1:18:53] you see your dream
[1:18:55] and now i cannot go with the ministry
[1:18:57] like that until i feel different in my
[1:19:00] heart about it no matter if god did tell
[1:19:04] me but that
[1:19:07] is that change
[1:19:09] that brother roy
[1:19:11] seen coming
[1:19:14] what was the change
[1:19:16] in that dream
[1:19:18] that god would remove him from the head
[1:19:20] of the table
[1:19:21] and then have to do a surgery in his
[1:19:24] heart and then set him back
[1:19:26] it was his attitude and his feeling
[1:19:30] towards people
[1:19:32] and if god cared so much how god's
[1:19:36] pronoun i know this is just simple but
[1:19:37] it's just i know i'm impressed to preach
[1:19:39] this to you here today
[1:19:41] if god would care so much
[1:19:43] about how god's prophet viewed people
[1:19:47] that sassed the word and wouldn't listen
[1:19:50] to the word of god and brother branham
[1:19:52] developed develops a complex and so much
[1:19:55] he just wants to quit the ministry and
[1:19:57] god cared so much about brother
[1:20:00] branham's attitude towards people
[1:20:02] you don't think god cares how we treat
[1:20:04] one another
[1:20:09] i should get a much bigger amen
[1:20:12] you don't think god cares how we treat
[1:20:14] one another
[1:20:16] let me go just a little bit further
[1:20:18] you don't think god cares about husband
[1:20:21] how you treat your wife or wife how you
[1:20:23] treat your husband or father how you
[1:20:25] treat your son or vice versa and how
[1:20:27] children treat each other you don't
[1:20:29] think god cares how we treat and our
[1:20:31] attitude towards one another and the
[1:20:33] attitudes we take towards people listen
[1:20:36] god's prophet allowed a complex brother
[1:20:39] adam says i allowed myself even to build
[1:20:41] a complex to where it tinted his vision
[1:20:45] or it tinted how he viewed people so
[1:20:48] much you say well you know we all get
[1:20:50] the bad the wrong attitude sometimes
[1:20:52] brother matt i mean sometimes we get you
[1:20:54] know we just get upset at one another
[1:20:56] and you know i know i got to get better
[1:20:58] about that you know sometimes i think we
[1:21:00] minimize that just a little too much
[1:21:04] whether brother branham would care so
[1:21:05] much about it that he said i'm just
[1:21:08] going to leave the field listen to what
[1:21:09] he says something's got to change me
[1:21:13] because in my heart if i go out there
[1:21:16] feeling the way i do now i still feel
[1:21:18] that they ought to have heard the
[1:21:19] message they ought to done it and i
[1:21:21] don't have the feeling for the people
[1:21:23] that i should have until i can get that
[1:21:25] feeling there's no need of me going
[1:21:27] because i'd be a hypocrite and all these
[1:21:29] years i've tried to serve him with a
[1:21:30] true heart and i won't go out there
[1:21:32] being a hypocrite i've got to feel that
[1:21:35] this isn't ricky and raketa it isn't
[1:21:37] this bunch it's god's children that's in
[1:21:40] bondage
[1:21:42] what a shift
[1:21:45] you say brother matt does it mean that
[1:21:46] the prophet wouldn't call out the same
[1:21:48] sin no you can call out the same and
[1:21:51] view the sin the same exact way
[1:21:54] brother branham could still call out the
[1:21:56] sin but his attitude he had towards it
[1:21:59] was two totally different things
[1:22:03] i must go them until i could feel that
[1:22:04] way i'll just loaf around preach some
[1:22:06] conventions and things but wait god
[1:22:08] bless you each one hope to see you again
[1:22:10] real soon until then will you do this
[1:22:11] one favor for me now both here and on
[1:22:13] tape also you brethren pray that god
[1:22:15] will place into my heart that's
[1:22:17] something that i lost
[1:22:19] out there
[1:22:21] in that complex
[1:22:23] it's so
[1:22:24] easy to build a complex
[1:22:28] and you could take
[1:22:30] and you don't even realize it prophet of
[1:22:32] god says i have lost
[1:22:34] pray that god will place into my heart
[1:22:37] that's something that i lost
[1:22:41] the bible says he's a satan's a a thief
[1:22:44] he comes to kill
[1:22:46] steal
[1:22:48] and destroy and if he can't get you on a
[1:22:50] bar stool somewhere he'll allow you to
[1:22:51] stay right in church but give you a
[1:22:53] grudge or a bitterness or a complex and
[1:22:57] rob you of everything
[1:22:59] and you don't even realize you've lost
[1:23:01] something as a believer you've lost your
[1:23:04] joy and now there's no joy you know joy
[1:23:06] is your strength
[1:23:08] hello
[1:23:11] and you lose something as a believer you
[1:23:13] don't even realize you're bitter and
[1:23:14] you're angry and you don't know listen
[1:23:17] you say brother matty here i'm not here
[1:23:19] to kick you
[1:23:20] or hurt you or condemn you i'm here to
[1:23:23] tell you jesus can heal every part of
[1:23:25] you he can heal what a doctor can't heal
[1:23:28] his tools his tool bag has tools that
[1:23:30] physicians don't have
[1:23:34] and just like that he says i've he says
[1:23:37] it's so easy to build a complex i don't
[1:23:40] know the video the other day with
[1:23:41] brother way sitting here standing here
[1:23:43] in front of good man but build himself
[1:23:45] around a complex another kind of complex
[1:23:46] did the same thing brother ray by the
[1:23:48] way you can so easily do it it's you
[1:23:51] just get a little something in your mind
[1:23:53] keep thinking that way
[1:23:56] go back and check it with the scripture
[1:23:58] and see if it's right or not then go
[1:24:00] from their own don't lose the feeling of
[1:24:03] the people you must remember they're not
[1:24:05] made out of sawdust they're flesh and
[1:24:08] blood human beings and a soul pray for
[1:24:10] me all of you if you will god bless you
[1:24:12] we're going to bow our heads and ask
[1:24:14] brother
[1:24:16] i'm glad we had that kind of honesty
[1:24:20] go to that next one if you could brother
[1:24:21] matthew it's just six o'clock now
[1:24:24] can i have just a few more minutes
[1:24:26] so something would come in brother
[1:24:28] branham's life
[1:24:29] cleaning out those channels now he
[1:24:31] builds a complex listen what brother
[1:24:33] branham says here uh about cancer and
[1:24:36] i'm just going to read some of these
[1:24:37] quotations let me pull it up on my
[1:24:39] screen my brother brian and my brother
[1:24:41] matthew is getting these quotes pulled
[1:24:43] up of the prophet listen to what brother
[1:24:46] branham says here in healing this is
[1:24:48] 1953 its parenthesis message is what
[1:24:51] cancer is
[1:24:52] now a cancer
[1:24:54] that second greatest enemy the world has
[1:24:58] heart troubles first then cancer
[1:25:00] tubercular according to according to the
[1:25:02] insurance companies now the cancer would
[1:25:04] be caught in a natural a scavenger or a
[1:25:07] buzzard something that eats dead things
[1:25:10] a cancer usually comes from a bruise a
[1:25:13] bruise it strikes
[1:25:15] and the cells break in other words they
[1:25:18] backslide and then in there sets up
[1:25:23] everybody say this with me together
[1:25:25] another life
[1:25:27] say it again another life
[1:25:30] so here's what a cancer is it's another
[1:25:33] life
[1:25:34] it starts brother branham says those
[1:25:37] cells
[1:25:38] he says he says cancer comes from a
[1:25:40] bruise strikes and the cells break in
[1:25:42] other words they backslide
[1:25:44] and he says and then there
[1:25:47] sets up the betting ground or the
[1:25:49] foundation
[1:25:51] for another life
[1:25:53] i was just maybe two months ago now
[1:25:57] had a good friend very close you
[1:25:58] remember brother travis actually came
[1:26:00] here how many remembers brother travis
[1:26:02] good friend of mine and he sat here and
[1:26:03] gave his testimony how he came to the
[1:26:05] message just powerful you won't find a
[1:26:07] bolder witness for the message of the
[1:26:09] hour than brother travis just will tell
[1:26:11] you what the lord's done for him and how
[1:26:13] he's changed his life
[1:26:15] and
[1:26:16] brother travis had came to me and long
[1:26:19] before he had came into the message
[1:26:21] before the church actually before he
[1:26:23] came to our church and and found the
[1:26:25] truth he was he was at a what they call
[1:26:27] a vineyard church and it's a
[1:26:30] a non-denominational evangelical type of
[1:26:33] church
[1:26:34] and there was a man there the associate
[1:26:36] pastor name is marcus
[1:26:38] and big strong guy i mean just in the
[1:26:41] very healthy eight his his diet was very
[1:26:44] good he was kept himself in shape and
[1:26:47] just a really good really good genuine
[1:26:50] guy i met he had a chance to meet him uh
[1:26:52] three or four months prior to this and
[1:26:54] and just got to shake his hand and
[1:26:56] travis introduced me to him he was a
[1:26:58] associate pastor and travis had told me
[1:27:01] that he was diagnosed with cancer and
[1:27:04] that it was very bleak and it was it was
[1:27:06] bad and the doctors had given up on him
[1:27:09] given any hope for him to live and when
[1:27:10] they found it was already stage four
[1:27:13] hopkins lymphoma and and it looked like
[1:27:16] he was just gonna go and he was alright
[1:27:18] his health was already breaking down and
[1:27:20] this person was very close very close to
[1:27:23] brother travis and he asked me said
[1:27:25] brother matt would you come with me and
[1:27:26] would you pray
[1:27:28] and lay your hands on him and let's pray
[1:27:30] the prayer of faith for him and i want
[1:27:31] to go and visit him and have just a
[1:27:32] conversation with him and i said
[1:27:34] absolutely you know brother travis i
[1:27:36] mean count me in whenever you want to go
[1:27:38] we'll go and speak to him and we'll pray
[1:27:40] pray the prayer of faith for him and so
[1:27:43] that maybe
[1:27:44] a week passed by two weeks and travis
[1:27:47] called me and said okay i've just spoke
[1:27:48] to mary uh marcus is at home and we
[1:27:51] could go in and so we had a moment just
[1:27:53] there very special i just even here now
[1:27:57] uh reminiscing about it just a very
[1:27:59] special moment uh that we had there in
[1:28:02] the living room of this man's home and
[1:28:04] he's man much elder to me um and and and
[1:28:08] he's a wonderful christian man
[1:28:10] and he just begins to you could tell
[1:28:12] just by looking at him that he looked
[1:28:14] different from the last time i had seen
[1:28:15] him as you could tell his health had uh
[1:28:17] you know you could almost see just that
[1:28:19] look to where his health had just left
[1:28:21] him and and he was stooped over and he
[1:28:24] could still speak to us and you know he
[1:28:26] began to just reminisce with travis and
[1:28:28] you know and and and just begin to tell
[1:28:30] us about his condition and how the
[1:28:32] doctors said there was another family
[1:28:34] there from his church a woman who had
[1:28:36] lost her
[1:28:38] 16-year-old son to cancer
[1:28:40] and she was a big advocate
[1:28:42] uh there for uh cancer research and she
[1:28:45] was there and her husband was there and
[1:28:47] i asked her they believers yes they go
[1:28:49] to my church and and so we just i just
[1:28:51] began to listen and begin to tell us you
[1:28:53] know a little bit about his diagnosis
[1:28:55] and you could tell on the side of his
[1:28:57] neck there was a growth about the size
[1:28:59] of a grapefruit just massive growth
[1:29:02] off of his neck and that was just one
[1:29:04] tumor that he had in his body many more
[1:29:06] that you couldn't see
[1:29:08] and and i began to just even before we
[1:29:11] went there to the uh to the the
[1:29:15] man's home i just in the vehicle right
[1:29:17] there with brother travis so let's just
[1:29:18] pray right now get our spirits right
[1:29:21] before we go and speak to this man and
[1:29:23] so you know i just was waiting on the
[1:29:25] lord as you do and just feeling just
[1:29:27] waiting for the holy spirit there in
[1:29:29] that moment just to maybe say something
[1:29:31] that i could say to help him or to to
[1:29:33] get his faith in the right place you
[1:29:35] know it's really hard often for yourself
[1:29:38] it's very easy to have faith for other
[1:29:40] people but when it's you and you're the
[1:29:42] one it's much harder to you know to have
[1:29:44] a positive attitude let alone faith to
[1:29:46] believe god is going to do something for
[1:29:48] you and so a lot of times you encourage
[1:29:50] you try your best to encourage that
[1:29:52] person and you remind them the word this
[1:29:54] man knew very well
[1:29:56] you know was a bible theologian knew
[1:29:58] that knew the bible very well the verses
[1:30:00] i would quote to him i knew he knew but
[1:30:02] sometimes god just uses something just
[1:30:03] to give a spark of faith and begin to
[1:30:06] speak to him and a lot of the things i
[1:30:08] began to tell him was right out of this
[1:30:10] message what cancer isn't brother travis
[1:30:13] begin to testify a little bit about uh
[1:30:15] you know he says you know brother he
[1:30:17] says marcus i'm just going to cut to the
[1:30:19] chase you're at your end of a lie here
[1:30:20] at you you know the end of your life the
[1:30:22] doctors have told you not going to be
[1:30:23] here much longer so it's not a time for
[1:30:25] me to mince words or you know and just
[1:30:27] beat her on the bush i'm just going to
[1:30:29] come right out and tell you that you
[1:30:31] know and man brother travis i tell you
[1:30:32] what he just began to witness
[1:30:35] to this man the message of the end time
[1:30:37] and the end time truth and and just
[1:30:39] begin to witness to this man how god had
[1:30:41] changed his life and he found a real
[1:30:43] living god and a real true living savior
[1:30:46] and and uh man just was bold if you
[1:30:49] everybody i told him afterwards i said
[1:30:50] man if i was ever in a a foxhole i'd
[1:30:52] want you on at my back
[1:30:54] um just a person you just could count on
[1:30:57] and uh and and and so we just begin and
[1:31:00] i begin to tell him how that cancer that
[1:31:03] was there in his body and i began to say
[1:31:04] marcus you know the the doctors they're
[1:31:07] you know they they use the only tools
[1:31:10] science has given them and the research
[1:31:12] that they have and and if they could go
[1:31:14] in there with a knife and they could cut
[1:31:15] out all of the cancer then great that'd
[1:31:17] be that'd be wonderful and they'll do
[1:31:20] their best to you know to do what they
[1:31:22] can do and and then i said now but you
[1:31:24] have to remember those doctors only look
[1:31:27] at a physical
[1:31:28] uh they look at the flesh the physical
[1:31:31] outward realm
[1:31:32] and they deal in that outward realm
[1:31:34] their scans and their pet scans that
[1:31:36] they that they have are all dealing not
[1:31:39] looking into another dimension they're
[1:31:40] looking at the dimension that you see
[1:31:42] and what i see and i said they deal with
[1:31:44] the they deal with the body i said but i
[1:31:47] want you to understand here that cancer
[1:31:50] is just a name that science has given
[1:31:53] that disease
[1:31:55] but and i said i also want you to
[1:31:57] realize that that tumor that's on your
[1:31:59] neck that's just a body of a life that's
[1:32:02] living inside of you it's a spirit
[1:32:06] and i said because cancer is a life it's
[1:32:08] another life that's not your life that
[1:32:12] is sucking the life out of you and
[1:32:14] trying to destroy you and if it could
[1:32:16] have its way it will destroy you and
[1:32:18] it'll kill you
[1:32:20] and i said so when i pray for you i'm
[1:32:23] not going to do like the doctor i'm not
[1:32:25] praying at that outward physical thing
[1:32:27] that i see on your neck i'm going to
[1:32:29] speak to the life or the spirit that's
[1:32:32] hiding behind that tumor
[1:32:34] and you remember the random this morning
[1:32:36] we read about it when he comes and he
[1:32:37] says you've got a heart trouble you've
[1:32:39] got a heart condition yes brother
[1:32:40] branham that's right i do and he says
[1:32:42] you're even living with it now and he
[1:32:44] says oh
[1:32:45] it's a lie
[1:32:47] and he says they've told a lie about you
[1:32:49] he says they called you a witch a man
[1:32:51] that's confessing a divine healing and
[1:32:53] the woman says that's right he says
[1:32:55] you're not a witch sister you're a child
[1:32:57] of god go home and be free what was he
[1:32:59] doing he was going beyond the heart
[1:33:02] condition that was the outward external
[1:33:05] evidence and he was exposing the spirit
[1:33:08] that was hiding behind that heart
[1:33:10] trouble
[1:33:12] and when he did she was free
[1:33:15] and so brother branham says notice what
[1:33:17] cancer is he says it sets up another
[1:33:19] life
[1:33:20] now look the pollen from the male to the
[1:33:22] females are tiny little germs so they
[1:33:24] can i cannot see it it has to be seen
[1:33:26] through glasses the first little thing
[1:33:28] looks like there's a knot tied in that
[1:33:30] little cell starts in the spine begins
[1:33:32] to develop he's talking about how life
[1:33:34] begins and the seed it begins to
[1:33:36] germinate and the egg and then he says
[1:33:38] then from there you gotta he says the
[1:33:40] spine begins to develop and cells and
[1:33:42] every seed after it's kind dog after dog
[1:33:44] human after human foul after fall so
[1:33:46] forth according to the metal and female
[1:33:48] now if you'll notice that little germ
[1:33:50] begins to swell
[1:33:52] and it forms
[1:33:53] and that was you one time begin to push
[1:33:57] out cells push out push out cells until
[1:34:00] it becomes nine months of age born then
[1:34:04] it becomes an adult woman or man and
[1:34:06] here you are today come from one little
[1:34:10] germ just developing cells
[1:34:13] sell on cell
[1:34:16] that's how it begins now if you'll
[1:34:18] notice that line over there says no now
[1:34:20] for instance a cancer comes from a
[1:34:23] bruise and it's a growth too
[1:34:26] so is tumor cataract or we could spend
[1:34:28] hours on what it is now those let's say
[1:34:31] cancer first it's a teeny little cell
[1:34:34] and it begins to develop cells and it
[1:34:36] doesn't have any form it just goes
[1:34:39] anyway spreads out with legs some wrap
[1:34:42] around and some like rose cancer and red
[1:34:44] cancer and black cancer sarcomas cancer
[1:34:46] different varieties of them but they're
[1:34:48] not any certain way because they are
[1:34:50] spirit
[1:34:51] and spirit has no form
[1:34:55] do you know that a demon spirit has no
[1:34:58] form except the form or life or the host
[1:35:01] that it dwells in
[1:35:04] you say how could a man go into a school
[1:35:07] of little elementary children go in
[1:35:09] there with a gun and kill children and
[1:35:11] begin to shoot people that wasn't that
[1:35:13] man that did that the man was just the
[1:35:15] host or the body of a spirit that had
[1:35:18] and infiltrated that man's mind
[1:35:20] he may not even have realized that he
[1:35:22] was under demonic control
[1:35:25] and brother branham says i prophesy to
[1:35:26] you in the name of the lord
[1:35:28] this world will go completely insane
[1:35:34] you say a cancer spirit yes sir i can
[1:35:37] prove it to you that it's a life and the
[1:35:39] devil now as old-fashioned as it seems
[1:35:41] to be but there's not a sickness in the
[1:35:43] world but what's caused by the devil
[1:35:45] sickness came from the devil sickness is
[1:35:46] a direct end result he says a direct or
[1:35:49] indirect result notice sickness now this
[1:35:51] is a fleshly this is a a something he's
[1:35:54] speaking about in the flesh sickness
[1:35:56] came from the devil sickness is a direct
[1:35:58] or indirect result from sin maybe not
[1:36:02] your sin
[1:36:04] but something you
[1:36:07] inherited aha
[1:36:10] something you inherited before we had
[1:36:13] any sin we had no sickness after sin
[1:36:16] came then sickness was the attributes of
[1:36:18] sin now watch this cancer now say on my
[1:36:22] hand now there's none there now there
[1:36:25] could be some day well there it is then
[1:36:28] if it's a growth comes on that hand a
[1:36:30] cancer or whatever it may be it's
[1:36:32] another
[1:36:33] life
[1:36:35] it's developing a different cell though
[1:36:38] it is a cell but it started from a life
[1:36:42] just like you started before that little
[1:36:45] germ that's as far as we can tear your
[1:36:46] body down to that one single cell that
[1:36:49] little germ is a tiny little cell just
[1:36:51] beyond that cell is a spirit because
[1:36:54] it's got a life well that life came from
[1:36:56] god for you but where did this life of
[1:36:59] death come in your body which is called
[1:37:01] cancer who brought that there
[1:37:03] that's the devil
[1:37:06] now jesus called it a devil and by being
[1:37:08] a minister that's the terms i take
[1:37:10] notice what the bible says notice listen
[1:37:12] what brother adam says today we see a
[1:37:14] man that's deaf and dumb the doctors say
[1:37:18] well his vocal cord is dead his hearing
[1:37:21] over his eardrums the nerves died what
[1:37:24] caused it doctor well i don't know it
[1:37:26] just died some fever done it or
[1:37:29] something well why didn't the nerves die
[1:37:31] all over see it just died there now
[1:37:33] jesus said that it was a deaf spirit
[1:37:36] the doctor says the nerve died jesus
[1:37:38] said a deaf spirit did it
[1:37:41] notice now jesus said that it was a deaf
[1:37:43] spirit is that right that when the deaf
[1:37:45] and dumb spirit came out of a man he
[1:37:48] could speak and hear now it's just like
[1:37:50] a transparent band around my hand
[1:37:54] shutting the circulation off you notice
[1:37:57] these people come up on the platform
[1:37:59] here's the deaf and dumb
[1:38:00] walk off speaking and hearing see what
[1:38:03] happens a man comes here he's deaf
[1:38:06] you've seen it night after night he
[1:38:08] can't hear a woman she's looking around
[1:38:10] in the years notice if you go to this
[1:38:13] tape in healing there's a man in the end
[1:38:15] after brother adam gets through
[1:38:17] preaching this and the prayer line is a
[1:38:18] man who's completely deaf
[1:38:21] and brother brandon begins to talk to
[1:38:22] him and he has the man up there trying
[1:38:24] to uh get you know tell give him sign
[1:38:26] lane or to uh he brother branham this
[1:38:28] man is completely different brother
[1:38:29] brandon actually when he tells the man
[1:38:31] gets real close to him he says now sir
[1:38:32] now i'm going to pray for you he says
[1:38:34] sir can you hear me can you hear me and
[1:38:36] the man can hear mumbling maybe
[1:38:38] something muddy and he i don't i don't
[1:38:40] and no i could no i don't i don't and
[1:38:42] the the man that's there with him on the
[1:38:44] tape brother brandon says okay well
[1:38:46] let's just begin to pray and brother
[1:38:47] brandon begins to call out and he speaks
[1:38:50] and says now you spirit that's got that
[1:38:53] man that eardrum and you're pinching
[1:38:55] that nerve i speak to you in the name of
[1:38:58] the lord jesus christ let go of that
[1:39:00] nerve
[1:39:01] and brother branham gets in his face and
[1:39:03] says sir can you yes sir i can hear you
[1:39:05] now praise the lord i can hear what
[1:39:07] you're saying now brother branham just
[1:39:09] like that a deaf spirit is cast out
[1:39:11] leaves the man and now the man can hear
[1:39:16] listen what jesus says in mark chapter 9
[1:39:18] when jesus saw the people come running
[1:39:20] together he rebuked the foul
[1:39:24] spirit saying unto him thou dumb and
[1:39:28] death
[1:39:30] spirit
[1:39:31] notice not disease
[1:39:34] not dead nerve now a spear can kill it
[1:39:37] that is what deafness is but a spirit
[1:39:41] calls that
[1:39:43] jesus says thou deaf and dumb spirit i
[1:39:45] charge thee come out of him and enter no
[1:39:48] more into him then it's an unseen force
[1:39:51] just like a transparent ban around my
[1:39:53] hand now notice how brother branham
[1:39:55] describes this with a transparent band
[1:39:58] you got a band around my hand and it's
[1:40:01] cutting the circulation off
[1:40:03] brother branham says no matter how much
[1:40:05] salve you put on the end of this finger
[1:40:09] it's got the circulation shut off and it
[1:40:11] can't get well
[1:40:13] until you move
[1:40:15] this band
[1:40:18] you see remember what brother branham
[1:40:20] says there's a reason for
[1:40:23] everything
[1:40:26] and what is a spirit you say well that's
[1:40:27] just my temper well that's a spirit
[1:40:30] well i was just i was just born that way
[1:40:32] don't you believe a lie of the devil
[1:40:35] there's a band that's got your
[1:40:37] circulation cut off
[1:40:39] and until you remove the band
[1:40:43] as brother branham says no matter how
[1:40:44] much salve you put on the end of this
[1:40:46] finger you've got to remove the band
[1:40:49] you've got to remove the curse you've
[1:40:51] got to know what it is that's why i love
[1:40:53] even at our at our we had a youth camp
[1:40:56] just about to have one here coming up
[1:40:58] and we had one last year and at the
[1:41:00] prayer line there was many you know they
[1:41:02] have many camps and youth youth meetings
[1:41:04] and they'll they'll take young people
[1:41:06] and they'll pass them through a line
[1:41:08] where there's ministers i'm thankful for
[1:41:10] that and there's camps that have too
[1:41:11] many young people and that's the only
[1:41:12] way you can pray for them but we did it
[1:41:14] differently uh back home and we actually
[1:41:17] a brother minister said brother matt
[1:41:19] i've noticed in prayer lines it's
[1:41:21] important for the people for the young
[1:41:23] person to say what their problem is to
[1:41:27] say what their need is to speak because
[1:41:30] when you speak and when you identify you
[1:41:34] expose
[1:41:35] the spirit
[1:41:38] and as they begin to speak what was it
[1:41:40] they were using their voice to say i'm
[1:41:42] not that's not who i am my depression is
[1:41:45] not me my addiction is not me the change
[1:41:49] that's that's a band that's around my
[1:41:51] life and we watch night we watch night
[1:41:53] after night god deliver people from
[1:41:56] those spirits
[1:41:59] brother branham says until you move this
[1:42:01] band
[1:42:03] well now that band in this case i'm
[1:42:04] talking about a deafness is a spirit an
[1:42:06] unseen person and what that thing is
[1:42:08] cast away of course that gives a nature
[1:42:10] he says that gives nature a chance to
[1:42:12] operate and then they begin to hear now
[1:42:14] lung cancer it begins to develop a body
[1:42:16] gets larger larger it's got one
[1:42:18] alternative it's got one alternative
[1:42:21] take your life
[1:42:24] this is how a complex starts
[1:42:27] say oh brother we're talking about
[1:42:28] cancer yes we are spiritual cancer
[1:42:33] you say i'm cancer i don't you know i
[1:42:35] don't have any kind of disease in my
[1:42:36] flesh oh but let's look beyond the flesh
[1:42:39] because remember there's another part of
[1:42:40] you than what you see in the mirror
[1:42:44] and you watch what that
[1:42:47] what that spirit will do remember we're
[1:42:49] preaching about deliverance how do you
[1:42:51] get free from this
[1:42:53] there's a part there's a reason for
[1:42:55] everything brother branham says it's got
[1:42:57] one alternative take your life
[1:42:59] now all the natural is a spiritual as i
[1:43:02] said you believe that do you now the
[1:43:04] cancer come into this store place or
[1:43:06] this bruised place and he took a body
[1:43:09] and he begins to suck on your blood one
[1:43:11] purpose take your life the doctor can
[1:43:15] cut it out if there's one speck of it
[1:43:17] left it'll start right there growing
[1:43:18] again now the thing happened in the way
[1:43:20] if the doctor could operate and take it
[1:43:22] out that's very well that's good he'll
[1:43:24] take it out now on the doctor's way of
[1:43:26] destroying my body or your body if you
[1:43:28] as a cancer will be just to diminish me
[1:43:30] from the earth that's all now the way of
[1:43:33] divine healing it isn't dealing with
[1:43:37] that body at all
[1:43:39] it's dealing with that life that's in
[1:43:42] that body
[1:43:45] are you here tonight you're catching
[1:43:46] this
[1:43:47] if you was a cancer and i was a healing
[1:43:49] he says and i was healing the earth of
[1:43:51] you being a cancer i call your life out
[1:43:52] of you well there lays your body your
[1:43:55] body is just as natural there as it
[1:43:57] would be if the life was in it it's
[1:43:59] laying there in every feature and
[1:44:01] everything now many people don't
[1:44:03] understand divine healing that's the
[1:44:05] reason they never get their divine
[1:44:07] healing they don't understand it's
[1:44:10] deeper than what you might see that's
[1:44:12] why brother branham says you've this is
[1:44:14] what happens
[1:44:15] to him when he develops this complex and
[1:44:17] it begins to build it up and now he's
[1:44:19] gotten so calloused and so indifferent a
[1:44:22] minister as
[1:44:24] a a a prophet of the age and he's
[1:44:26] developed such an attitude
[1:44:29] the prophet seventh angel messenger the
[1:44:31] prophet to the latest in church age and
[1:44:33] he's developed such an attitude that
[1:44:34] he's ready to leave the field and stop
[1:44:36] preaching all together
[1:44:39] because there's a there's a complex
[1:44:41] that's being built in his life
[1:44:46] you've got to loose
[1:44:49] the band
[1:44:51] you've got to become free
[1:44:54] and let the channels become cleaned out
[1:44:58] how do i get free brother matt
[1:45:00] how do i get free of that of that
[1:45:02] problem you let the lord come down
[1:45:05] and heal every single part of your being
[1:45:10] that cancer
[1:45:13] starts off brother branham says starts
[1:45:15] off with just a little cell and then it
[1:45:18] gets it gets struck it gets hit it gets
[1:45:21] damaged
[1:45:22] and he says then it backslides
[1:45:25] and he says then it lays the betting
[1:45:27] ground
[1:45:29] for life
[1:45:31] and if you continue to feed it
[1:45:33] and you continue to feed it as brother
[1:45:35] adam talked about that black dog and
[1:45:37] that white dog you continue to feed it
[1:45:39] it gets stronger it builds more life and
[1:45:42] more life and more life and now that
[1:45:45] life is living off of your life
[1:45:48] and it's trying to destroy you
[1:45:52] you know what that that spirit that
[1:45:53] complex wanted to do to god's prophet it
[1:45:55] wanted him to take a detour now remember
[1:45:58] what we said not backslide
[1:46:01] not to go off into sin but just deviate
[1:46:04] a little bit from the word
[1:46:06] to deviate a little bit from the path or
[1:46:08] the plan of god that he had for his life
[1:46:12] and i just as i sat there i was reading
[1:46:14] this
[1:46:15] these quotes from standing in the gap
[1:46:16] and i thought my goodness
[1:46:18] here the prophet of god is preaching to
[1:46:21] us telling us about this standing in the
[1:46:24] gap he's telling us about this complex
[1:46:26] that he's developed
[1:46:29] and here it is
[1:46:31] june
[1:46:33] 1963
[1:46:34] and i thought to myself
[1:46:36] what would have happened
[1:46:38] had brother branham took in that detour
[1:46:43] what would have happened
[1:46:45] had he succumbed to the pressures of his
[1:46:48] own remember his own justification of
[1:46:50] how he was justifying that
[1:46:52] and rather than letting the lord
[1:46:55] change him from that
[1:46:57] from that place that he was at he just
[1:46:59] decided i'm good i'm going to settle in
[1:47:01] right here you see why it's so important
[1:47:03] what we said to you today you've got to
[1:47:06] constantly be
[1:47:08] being
[1:47:09] changed
[1:47:11] you can never settle or stop
[1:47:15] you can never let something sideline you
[1:47:18] or put you on the side i don't care what
[1:47:19] it is or what you want to list here
[1:47:21] today
[1:47:22] you've got to move on
[1:47:25] you've got to continue to move you've
[1:47:27] got to continue to live you've got to
[1:47:29] continue to go
[1:47:31] because if satan can accomplish anything
[1:47:33] that he that he can in your life may not
[1:47:35] get you to turn around and do a u-turn
[1:47:37] but it'll get you to take a left turn
[1:47:38] when god says no keep going straight
[1:47:40] child don't go that way and oh i just
[1:47:42] say here today lord would you send your
[1:47:45] word to expose the devil how many could
[1:47:47] just raise a hand and say lord i want to
[1:47:49] be free of any cancer that i've got
[1:47:51] building in my body right now i want you
[1:47:54] to deliver me and heal me of any cell
[1:47:56] spiritually speaking of anything in my
[1:47:58] life that's not according to your word
[1:48:01] i want you to set me free from it we
[1:48:03] prayed the prayer of faith for that man
[1:48:05] laid my hands on marcus begin to call
[1:48:07] out to god said i'm going to pray for
[1:48:08] you maybe in a way you've never heard
[1:48:10] prayed for and i began to speak to that
[1:48:12] demon spirit me and brother travis
[1:48:15] called on the name of god and i could
[1:48:17] feel the anointing just drop in that
[1:48:19] room as that man's faith you can feel
[1:48:21] was accepting of that
[1:48:23] doctors gave him i testified to him i
[1:48:25] said you know hopkins lymphoma stage
[1:48:28] four
[1:48:29] there was a little sister we've got in
[1:48:31] our sister church in louisiana who was t
[1:48:34] i was testifying too and i said she was
[1:48:36] diagnosed also with stage four hopkins
[1:48:39] lymphoma he said really
[1:48:41] he said you got to be kidding me i said
[1:48:42] no we i said here she was in a little
[1:48:45] she was in a church service and she
[1:48:47] began there was diagnosed ass and each
[1:48:49] because he had just showed me his pet
[1:48:51] scans he brought up his phone said mary
[1:48:53] his wife had showed me the pet scans and
[1:48:55] here's marcus and you could see his pet
[1:48:56] scans of the cancer just completely
[1:48:59] eating his body
[1:49:00] and i said that's i said let me show you
[1:49:02] her pet scan marcus so i pulled up the
[1:49:04] testimony from brother tim pruitt's
[1:49:06] church there if you don't know the
[1:49:07] testimony of sister elena butts i'd get
[1:49:09] i recommend you to go and find that
[1:49:11] video and watch it it's just wonderful
[1:49:13] and you could see the pet scan of sister
[1:49:14] elena and i showed him i said you see
[1:49:16] this here here's her and i compared it
[1:49:18] to his almost looked identical and you
[1:49:20] could see the cancer and sister sister
[1:49:23] elena's body and i said you know marcus
[1:49:25] i said that woman was prayed for that
[1:49:27] sister was prayed for she was sitting in
[1:49:29] the service and now i don't know why you
[1:49:32] know not saying this is something that
[1:49:34] everybody's got to do but she began to
[1:49:36] to to ponder how that david danced
[1:49:38] before the lord when he seen the ark of
[1:49:40] the covenant coming back to jerusalem
[1:49:43] and i said and the lord just struck
[1:49:44] something inside of her heart and said
[1:49:45] get up and john get up and dance uh run
[1:49:48] around the do a jericho march run around
[1:49:50] the the uh the the sanctuary so said
[1:49:52] that sister got up she began to run and
[1:49:55] no one else was running no one else was
[1:49:56] jumping she began to run around the
[1:49:59] sanctuary and just praising god and
[1:50:01] praising god i said you know what god
[1:50:02] did for her marcus god supernaturally
[1:50:05] healed her of that stage 4 hopkins
[1:50:06] lymphoma the doctor said had no chance
[1:50:09] and you'll never live she's living today
[1:50:12] cancer free
[1:50:15] you know what that did that brought his
[1:50:16] faith up just a little bit just where he
[1:50:18] could believe the word god is no
[1:50:20] respecter of persons friends
[1:50:22] i got a text just last week
[1:50:25] from his wife hallelujah big capital
[1:50:28] praise the name of the lord marcus is
[1:50:30] cancer-free
[1:50:34] hallelujah
[1:50:36] what was it there was a life
[1:50:39] trying to take his life
[1:50:41] there was a life trying to suck the life
[1:50:43] out of his life and if satan could do
[1:50:45] anything to you he'll try to destroy you
[1:50:48] in any way that he can
[1:50:50] remember that's
[1:50:52] his goal
[1:50:54] is to destroy you to annihilate you to
[1:50:57] deform your mind of your thinking
[1:51:00] brother branham
[1:51:01] brother branham uses that and says that
[1:51:03] life of that cancer and you hear at the
[1:51:05] end of that message as he begins to call
[1:51:07] it even to that death man i testified of
[1:51:09] today now you may not have
[1:51:12] sp you may not have a you know an issue
[1:51:15] with any of these diseases cancer or
[1:51:17] deafness or tuberculosis or heart
[1:51:20] trouble you know or anything maybe you
[1:51:21] do here today
[1:51:23] i was testifying just thinking of sister
[1:51:25] connie she told me even right at the end
[1:51:27] of the service today she was cancer-free
[1:51:28] and i thought you know the god who could
[1:51:30] heal a physical cancer surely could heal
[1:51:33] something down inside of your heart
[1:51:36] the god who could deliver and
[1:51:38] set someone free of stage four hopkins
[1:51:40] lymphoma if he's a physician that can do
[1:51:42] a work on the outward body don't you
[1:51:44] think he's a physician that if you would
[1:51:47] open up your heart to him tonight and
[1:51:49] say lord i open up every door and every
[1:51:51] avenue i open up every come on friends
[1:51:54] can you do that here today i open up
[1:51:56] every channel lord to you i'm not going
[1:51:58] to hide any of it i'm going to open up
[1:52:00] every closet could you stand to your
[1:52:02] feet today with your hands raised and
[1:52:04] say lord i open up every avenue to you
[1:52:08] right now bow your heads with me if you
[1:52:09] could say lord i open up every channel
[1:52:13] i want to i want to be i want
[1:52:15] as brother branham gives the vic the
[1:52:17] brother gives the vision and he says you
[1:52:19] were different brother branham you
[1:52:20] looked different you were changed what
[1:52:22] was it
[1:52:23] his heart had been healed
[1:52:26] and i wonder if maybe something inside
[1:52:28] of you you could say here tonight with a
[1:52:30] hand
[1:52:32] head bowed eyes closed if you just play
[1:52:33] something softly for me
[1:52:37] and you could relate
[1:52:39] to god's prophet
[1:52:42] here tonight
[1:52:44] maybe i didn't call out your
[1:52:46] specific
[1:52:48] need that you've got upon your heart or
[1:52:49] what's on your
[1:52:51] mind right now
[1:52:54] but maybe you could identify
[1:52:58] you could say i too
[1:53:00] brother matt just as brother branham
[1:53:02] says
[1:53:06] pray that god
[1:53:08] will place into my heart
[1:53:10] that's something that i lost
[1:53:13] out there
[1:53:15] in that complex
[1:53:17] god did this
[1:53:18] gave this service even here tonight
[1:53:21] i believe the lord jesus has spoken
[1:53:24] specifically maybe to you here tonight
[1:53:28] and you just want to raise a hand and
[1:53:29] pray that and say lord
[1:53:32] i want
[1:53:34] everything
[1:53:35] that you want to give me
[1:53:37] and i'm not going to surrender any of it
[1:53:39] to the devil
[1:53:41] i'm not going to allow him to steal from
[1:53:43] me
[1:53:44] deceive for me something you have given
[1:53:47] me and i claim it in the name of the
[1:53:49] lord jesus i got uplifted hands
[1:53:52] and i claim whatever i've lost
[1:53:54] whatever satan has tried to steal from
[1:53:56] me and rob remember all that that woman
[1:53:59] needed was god to expose that lie in her
[1:54:02] life and she was free just like that
[1:54:04] and so tonight satan has been exposed
[1:54:08] and i raise my hands and say lord i
[1:54:10] accept my healing
[1:54:11] at whatever level you want to bring my
[1:54:14] healing maybe it is your physical body
[1:54:16] here tonight and you say that part of me
[1:54:18] needs it just raise a hand and accept it
[1:54:20] maybe it's healing in your mind or your
[1:54:22] spirit your emotion
[1:54:24] your memory your reasoning somewhere in
[1:54:26] there that you know satan is robbing you
[1:54:28] from
[1:54:29] you just want to surrender and say lord
[1:54:31] i give it to you right now
[1:54:33] i want that feeling as the prophet of
[1:54:36] god says give me that tender sweet
[1:54:39] humble kind love
[1:54:43] of the lord jesus
[1:54:45] will you restore it to me lord lord you
[1:54:47] see these hands up all over the building
[1:54:50] i didn't do that lord
[1:54:52] i didn't do that lord your word did that
[1:54:54] these are believers of your word

[2:20:47] appreciate that
[2:20:49] lord we thank you for today
[2:20:54] things in our own lives as we looked at
[2:20:56] him and maybe we've we've been afraid
[2:20:58] for them to be exposed
[2:21:02] maybe we'd think well that would ruin my
[2:21:04] image
[2:21:06] i've carefully built this image up
[2:21:08] around i've
[2:21:09] i want everybody to know that i am a
[2:21:11] christian

[2:21:14] said there's some things that are
[2:21:15] troubling you there's
[2:21:17] maybe we wonder why something like this
[2:21:19] might flare out a little bit and
[2:21:22] how that reaction would come from
[2:21:24] maybe a little bit of anger and
[2:21:27] something will say lord i don't want to
[2:21:28] do any and today lord you said let's go
[2:21:30] down to the root of it let's go down to
[2:21:32] the cause of it
[2:21:34] lord as you know how to do and you know
[2:21:36] how to expose
[2:21:37] but you do it for a reason not to shame
[2:21:40] us
[2:21:41] not to embarrass us
[2:21:43] not so people could laugh and look but
[2:21:44] for deliverance
[2:21:46] but to be set free for healing
[2:21:49] to be restored back to that fellowship
[2:21:52] without interference lord yes lord to
[2:21:55] walk with you to talk with you to hear
[2:21:57] that same voice that spoke to brother
