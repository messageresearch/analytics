[Music] chapter we'll start with the seventh verse [Music] then shall the dust return to the Earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it vanity of vanities sayeth the preacher all is Vanity the word vanity means meaningless a meaningless meaningless says the preacher is all meaningless and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yet he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many Proverbs the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even the words of truth the words of the wise are as goats and As Nails fastened by the master masters of assemblies which are given from one Shepherd and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there's no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for these words we pray father that the spirit the Holy Spirit would be among us this morning and Lord your will would be done and that we could glorify you father with our praise and with our worship with our songs with our words with our thoughts in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can take your seats again God bless you all it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord this morning I am welcome um first of all I want to well probably got to report that there's a lot of people sick um I see that there's quite a few missing this morning um so and then um tomorrow's a holiday let's cancel service this evening I um want to uh start in a series on the book of Hebrews and we'll if I can get that far in my notes this morning we'll um we'll start on that this morning and then we will play a uh a recorded sermon um on W on Wednesday night and maybe possibly next Sunday night and then I will be ministering on Sunday morning on on this book of Hebrews so we are going to put off our Wednesday night bible study a few weeks as we get into this wonderful wonderful book um welcome to guests see Michael back there Michael rhods God bless you with sister Ruth ra raise your hand there welcome it's good to have you a man a man in a white shirt and a tie with a little bit less on top you fit in perfect in this church man so God bless you welcome we we appreciate you you joining us I um in reading this brother Lyall minister on the Book of Ecclesiastes on Wednesday night and it's just the whole book is it's this message brought To Us by Solomon that is just it's a message of futility and it says that is this Vanity Vanity it's all vanity everything's meaningless everything's feudal and and reading this book and as brother Lyall was ministering on on Wednesday it's just it's something like why do we even come to church why do we pray why do we read our Bibles why do we do everything that we can what is the purpose in all of it there's got to be a purpose there's got to be something there that all the efforts that we make from the way that we look to come into church to to everything that we do there's got to be an ultimate goal in all of this and as Solomon said he said let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter and my sermon today is is the conclusion of the whole matter and what is that conclusion of this whole book I was this week I was um I asked a few of you to pray um that I was going to be helping a family with um with a young man that's was being sentenced on Friday and been praying about it as as many of you that were present on Wednesday night have been praying with me and the family was hoping for a miracle to happen there was a minimum sentence and it could have gone anywhere from the minimum all the way to many many many years in prison and the family was hoping that the attorney had suggested that there may be a hope for probation here that the judge could do it so the family was hoping for this and and and we were praying and and as I woke up on Friday morning and I was praying about these things he asking the Lord Lord have mercy on this young man bless his family and bless these people and as I was praying the thought came to my mind what is the conclusion of this matter so and so often we we're so s shortsighted that we think well the conclusion would be that this there's that there's a miracle in this and and we all give God the praise and all of a sudden this young man he's going to be in church every day he's going to be fellowshipping with us all and his life is just going to line up perfect and that's going to be the conclusion of the matter and it all starts with us getting our way and and the prayer being answered that the judge signs off on him and lets him go and as I was praying the thought came to my mind this this verse in Ecclesiastes of saying what is the conclusion what is the ultimate goal of all of this and my prayer just took a different direction and it was Lord if you need to keep this young man in prison keep him in prison what is the conclusion of this matter what is the end of these things it's not that he has to go sit in a jail cell for a few years but the end is a long way down the road where he has to come into the presence of God and when he stands in the presence of God what will be his eternal destination and a little bit of suffering right now is well worth it because the end is what what matters so I was praying about this and and then the thoughts came to my mind what good would it do for him for him to get released so actually we went I felt what the Lord was going to do and was trying to encourage the family and he ended up the judge gave him the minimum sentence which was still incarceration and and of course the family some of the family was upset other others were like no this is this is good he he had mercy on us and then I in talking to the family afterwards I said what decision would you make do we really believe in God I think we like to say that we do we like to come to church we like to maybe think that we're going to be okay on the other side but do we really believe that there is a God and do we really believe that he has a plan and if we do we don't want our will how often do I say it's not about me it's not about you but we want his will because his will will end up in Perfection we will benefit from his will because he has us in mind I'm spending some time in a cell or a room with just you and God it'll do you good I believe it'll do this young man good and and I committed to him no matter what that that hey I'm going to be there and I'm going to help them brother Jeremiah this is the one I was talking about when I I talked to you earlier he needs friends he needs help he needs God and he he told me he said when I first met him I started visiting I don't know over a month ago and he he said this that happened to me he said this is right and he says I'm thankful I'm here I'm thankful all of this happened he said because if I was out I didn't think about God he says but now all I do is think about God and I believe and I I believe the Lord laid it on my heart that I just need a little more time with him God speaking the Bible says that there is a way that seems right to a man but the end its end is the way to death and we we look around in the world and we all want to be successful and we all want we seek maybe popularity and riches and having fun and it leads to maybe hanging out and drinking with your friends enjoying the pleasures of the world loving the things of the world but the end and that sounds right in our minds but the end of that is death the Bible says and then God in his kindness who is rich in Mercy will cut our legs out from under us sometime and bring us to him but he ultimately he wants us to make the decision Lord I want you more than I want the things of the world first John says don't love the things of the the things don't love the world or the things of the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the desires of the Flesh and the desires of the eyes and the pride of life it's not from the father but it's from the world is what the scripture says and the world is passing away along with its desires but whoever does the will of God abides forever the world today brothers and sisters we get so caught up in the things of life and we want so bad to to fit in and we want so bad to prosper and we want so bad this this Society to PE for people to respect us and to people to think that we're something special and the end of those things is death they don't matter he wants us to enjoy life I believe I believe he wants us to have love with each other and and I believe he wants us to have peace but we can't find peace in the things of the world we find peace in the things of God that's where our that's where our lives rest that's where we put our whole confidence is in the things of God I'm going to tell a story um I'm going to wait to the kids the kids get here I was helping a uh there's another man that I helped out I I wanted to see him give his heart to the Lord he was he was on the streets and he had he had children and and he came to me and he he he wanted some help so he seemed to be sincere the words that he said seem sincere so I helped him out I gave him I gave him some money to to get a place to stay I got him a job good job and he started working at that at that job then I called a few days later and I talked to my friend who employed him and I said How's this guy doing and he said he says I haven't seen him since Tuesday he says he worked two days he he says he asked me for um some money for the for the days that he worked he said he had to pay some bills and he says I gave him I gave him the check I was expecting him to show up on Wednesday he didn't show up and he hasn't showed up since and I can't get a hold of him I think brother you had it you had what you needed right there to get going you had a job you had a place you had a really you had a church you had a pastor that cared about you you had somebody that was advocate for you and what did you do you took it and you just you you got what you needed right now you didn't think of the conclusion of the matter what you thought of is here's what I want to do right now and you left and now he's back on the streets back homeless and there's a reason he's homeless and it's no one else's fault it's his own fault and it's the selfishness of people that they want to serve themselves rather than than serving God and serving other people when we see brothers and sisters when we see the homeless people and I have a burden for them brother Arie has a burden for them both of us we're reaching out all the time we're trying to help and we're doing everything that we can but I see such a selfishness that I'm going to serve myself I know I have a family but I'm going to get what I want first and then you send the you see the end of that you see the conclusion of the matter is where they are now there's a story that brother brandom tells it's a fairy tale that I thought would go perfect with this so there's this as I said it's a fairy tale I actually found it on uh I found it on YouTube and it's like this really old video and and they they they played it there but it's it's the story of the magic flower and there's this prospector he's never had any money his life he's never been successful and he he's walking along and he sees this flower down on the ground and he picks the flower and the flower speaks to him and the flower says you don't have any money he says you've never you've been poor all of your life he says ask what you will and I'll give it to you so the man his flowers talking to him and and he looked out at this mountain and he says tell that mountain to open up and then all the gold and all the treasures that are in that mountain will be revealed and I will go and I will take that so the flower he takes the flower and he starts walking towards the mountain and the and an earthquake starts to happen starts to shake and the mountain opens up and they walk inside and they see that there's gold nuggets all over the place there's there's great gemstones over over here and there's there's silver and there there's gold and there's all of these things so the man goes in and he grabs the biggest gemstone and he takes it and he starts to run out he sets the flower down he starts to run out and the flower says wait you're forgetting the main thing man says oh yeah you're right so he goes back in and he says I'll take some of this silver and he he grabs the silver and he starts walking out and there's the flower there and the flower says wait you're forgetting the main thing he says oh yeah you're right so he goes back in and he grabs the gold and he starts out and the flower says once again you're forgetting the main thing he looks down and he says you're right he takes all the riches lets him down he knows the geology of the area so he sees this this rock that's there and he he grabs this rock and he says this rock is only in this area he says if I just have this rock I'll know exactly where to come back to this place and I can get my wagon and I can get my mule and I can go and I can fill it up and then I can have all of these riches so he takes the Rock and he starts out and the flower says sir you're forgetting the the main thing and he says he says he says I've got everything that I need I don't need you anymore and he walks out and as he's walking down the mountain he starts to hear the rumbling again and he looks back and there where the mountain had opened it closed with the flower inside and everything that he had and he was left with nothing but this rock he didn't consider the in end of the story he didn't consider the conclusion he didn't consider the sum of everything job when job was sick and and he was dying and his children had died and his wife was against him and he's there and he's he's picking the the scabs off of his arm and and he's sick and and he and he looks and he sees that there is a dead tree there and he sees that once the water had hit that dead tree that had been cut off that life started coming from it and job was thinking of the conclusion of the matter and job looks at the tree he wasn't looking at his dead family he wasn't looking at his wife he wasn't looking at how he had lost all his riches he looks at the tree and he sees the conclusion of the matter and he says if a tree can live again with just the scent of water he says whatat about a man what about the conclusion of that matter what about me when I die what about my children they're dead what about my loved ones what is the conclusion of the matter and then we see that you I was praying this morning I said Lord what's going to be the conclusion of the matter with my sermon today I I did I was serious did you ever um do you ever use Excel the spreadsheet I'm always in Excel and my favorite part of of excel is the little summation symbol and you can highlight a whole line as many numbers as you want and you can hit that summation symbol and WR at the bottom it adds them all up and you've got your answer right there it is so easy I can have I can have page and page and page and page of spreadsheets and then right at the end I'll hit copy copy copy copy paste summation boom and it gives me the answer I wish I could do that with life I do I wish I could say Lord I messed up over here what's the summation of all of this Lord we we've we we're doing this with the church what's what's the conclusion of the matter Lord I see all the problems Lord what is the conclusion I wish we could say that I wish we could do that but but we can't God wants us to come come always trusting in Him and we don't know we do know the end and the point is to get from here to get to there when Moses when he brought this law and the people wanted the law when Moses brought this law and he set the Ten Commandments and he said set all of these these these rules and one of them I believe it's the um sixth commandment was to honor the Sabbath and to keep it holy so let's turn to Numbers chapter 15 and let's see the conclusion of the matter with the law numbers 15:32 and he said from God he said honor the Sabbath keep it holy and while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon on the Sabbath day and they that found him Gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron and un all the congregation they didn't know what was going to happen this is the first one that had broken one of the laws that Moses brought down so what is the conclusion of the matter and they put him in the ward because it was not declared what should be done to him and the Lord said unto Moses The man shall be surely put to death and all the con congregation shall Stone him with stones without the camp and all the congregation brought him without means outside the camp and they stoned him with stones and he died as the Lord had commanded Moses remember when Moses was out up on Mount Si and all the rumbling and all the smoke that was going on and the people they came to the mountain and Moses was really excited he says you're going to get to talk to God and the people came and they saw the rumbling and they saw everything and they were like no no no no no these Stakes are too high let Moses speak and not God because they saw that their sins they didn't want to give up their sins they didn't want to start living right what they wanted they say oh just put a man between us and God and then we'll be okay because over here God's going to put us to together death but Moses he has compassion on us and it ruined they didn't think of the end game they didn't think of the conclusion of the matter they didn't think that hey this is going to separate us from God I'm not going to get to talk to him face to face I'm not going to get to to correspond with God but we do we want you to put a man or a priest or a prophet in that area so I can talk to this one and then he can go to God on my behalf because I don't want to back it up with my life God says okay I won't speak to him anymore and from that point on now we have these high priests and the high priests have to go in to the tabernacle into the holy of holies every year and make atonement for the sins and the then the priests have to kill the sacrifice and what God wanted in the in the whole time he just wanted fellowship with his people but instead of that the conclusion of the matter was the people didn't want fellowship with God so they said let put somebody else in our place I always say that it's not about you you know we're s we're such a selfish generation we're always thinking about ourselves we're always serving ourselves this is what makes me feel good this is what makes me happy this is what I want to do and that's I'm always saying hey listen it's not about you it's about what he said but in the end brothers and sisters it is about you it is about me because God loves us God wants us to be with him so this whole book all of it it's written for us it's all about us and the kindness of God the question then constantly comes up says how do we serve God and so here we have the law and we see that that God not only he gave the The Ten Commandments but then he gave many many other hundreds of other Commandments that the people were to live by and they took that and they said okay here's how we serve God and they started interpreting these laws and they interpreted them without the understanding of the conclusion of the matter what they did is they just started looking at the law and they didn't understand why it was written there's a place in the law that it says this it says Thou shalt not see a kid in his mother's milk it means in Modern English don't boil a baby goat in its mother's milk you may not have ever heard that it's like oh well that's odd I can check that box haven't done that one yet nor do I want to so they took this and they started interpreting this and they said okay well technically if you have this pot and you have milk in there that and you ever you ever cook with milk in there well that's got to be separate than this dish over here because this dish that you you could have meat over in this one and there could be a chance although outside there could be a chance that that pot that boiled that milk and this meat was made this was this goat's Mama's milk so you got to have separate dishes and we think of kosher and then it becomes getting too much it's like what do you this isn't this wasn't this wasn't the conclusion of the matter that's not why God said that well what did he say it you won't boil a baby goat in his mother's milk why would he say that it was because at that time when they were going over Canaan these people were idolators very worldly worshiping all of these different idols and that was Pro that was one of their practices that they would to make an offering to their God or whatever they were doing that they would boil this baby goat in its mother's milk so God was saying hey don't act like them don't be like them but what they did they didn't consider the conclusion of the matter what they did is they said okay well we're going to make a rule and this is how we're going to interpret it and then it went on and on and on and on all the way to today to where they have this big conglomeration of all these rules that don't make sense that they don't and they don't work and these are the same people people years later doing the same thing with the separate dishes and all of that these are the same people that broke the sixth commandment Thou shalt not kill and kill Jesus Christ amen keeping their dishes separate and the ninth commandment I believe it is that believe it is Thou shalt not bear false witness the Big 10 and they're separating their dishes they didn't understand the conclusion of the matter you can see that they killed Jesus they killed stepen they killed all the disciples they they hated the Christians and keeping their laws keeping their rules I'll say this how often do we do it you know Thou shalt not bear false witness one of the Ten Commandments how often do we gossip about somebody else amen even if it's true how often do we let something come out of our mouths that is not edifying to that person and then yet we keep our rules wow when Jesus speaking of the Sabbath when Jesus was he was coming into the fields and and he's this prophet and they they were a against him and Jesus's answer to them was in Matthew 5:1 17 The Sermon on the Mount his first sermon he says think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets he was saying things like I just said like hey you're not getting it it wasn't about separating your dishes because you're afraid that there might be a little bit of remnants of a milk of milk in this pot and you don't want to cook it in the same pot as this baby goat because it could be the same family and Jesus is like listen you don't you don't get it and they're saying but you came and you came to destroy this law and Jesus says in Matthew 5:17 he says think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I'm not come to destroy it but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass away not one jot or one tit shall in no wise pass from the law till it all be fulfilled so he's not saying that they need to start boiling a goat in his mother's milk he's saying that there is a greater meaning be of the law and of the prophets and he's saying listen it all comes what is the conclusion of the matter Jesus is saying I am the conclusion of the matter all of this was was working towards him they accused him of not respecting the Sabbath when he walked through the fields on that day and his disciples so they were going we would it would be on Sunday for us it was Saturday for them there they're going through and they're taking the they're taking the the Grain and they rub it in their hands and get the chaff off of it and they're eating it and there's all these fingers pointing at them saying listen you're not supposed to do that on the Sabbath all these these stories were coming to mind it's really neat what happened yesterday is I was praying I wanted to tell this story about Jesus saying that I desire mercy and not sacrifice that scripture was coming to mind and then another story where Jesus and his disciples as I just said we're walking through the fields eating the Grain on the Sabbath and then I wanted to talk about and I thought well maybe this one maybe he said this where Jesus said that he is the lord of the Sabbath and I looked it up Heath it's the same story all of those that I had in my heart to tell ma Mark chapter 2 verse 23 and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the Sabbath day and and his disciples began and they they went to pluck the ears of corn and the Pharisees said unto them behold why do they on the Sabbath day which is not lawful and he said unto them have you never heard what David did when he was in need and he was a hungered and they that were with him how he went into the house of God in the days of abiathar the high priest and did eat the shoe bread which is not lawful for the eat but for the priests and gave also to them that were with him so what happened if you remember the story that that David his his people needed food and David goes to to the synagogue to the temple and he asks the priest will you give us food to eat and the priest takes the food that was for the levitical priesthood for the Levites and was Abomination for anyone else David was from the tribe of Judah and he gives the food to David because they were hungry because they needed it and he went in the house I'll I'll read it again went to the house of God in those in the days of ABIA the high priest and did eat the shoe brid which is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gave also to them that were with him and said unto them the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath he's trying to say you're not getting the conclusion of the matter the reason you go to church is not because the rule says that we go to church on Sunday then you may you make it a r rule we we devote this time because we won't set aside that time otherwise we're human beings so when Jesus is saying that that this sabbath that this is a gift to you it's not he's God of the Sabbath God doesn't need the Sabbath we need the Sabbath because we're human beings and we're not going to take the time so he sets Church aside and says here's a rule rule that you go to church on Saturday in in the Jewish time because you're not going to do it in if if it's not a rule therefore verse 28 therefore the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath this is the conclusion of the whole matter here's the Sabbath here's Jesus saying hey I'm the god of the Sabbath what is it about the Sabbath the conclusion of the fourth I believe it's the fourth Commandment the Sabbath is hey go and worship set aside a day for the Lord because if you don't you're a human being everything else and work and and play and everything else is going to be taken place the place of that so set a rule and go to church worship pray don't work on this day no matter what and that's what it's for it's not for God it's for us wow so as I was asking the question what is the conclusion of the matter of this whole book why do we have preachers on Sunday and Wednesday why do why do we have preachers preaching about this book what's the reason is it just to get people into church is it just to get them to live a better life or is there a a higher calling is there more of of it than just that I see the world today and I I look and I there is such a force of knowledge in the world today we look at our phones and Daniel prophesied that the that knowledge would increase in the last days and we look at our phones and it's amazing when was a kid you know we didn't have cell phones we uh didn't even have internet when I was really young I couldn't just look something up I had to go and and look it up in a book and now it's just right here I don't even have to punch a button I can just say I don't say it because she'll answer but hey Siri you know oh there she did loyal assistant um but anything that you want to know and and and it'll tell you that knowledge shall increase and then now the this wisdom of the world it hurts our faith because all we have to do now is we just look it up and we can search and how it's like well there's it's not possible for the Red Sea toart it's not possible for these things to happen in fact we can't find any evidence that all of this happened and all through the internet so really why should I believe it it why should I even believe that there is a God what has he done for me and people really say that people think that why is it why does this even matter and here we have these people at the turn of the Millennia when Jesus Christ comes and they're all caught up in all of their their pots and their dishes and and you have the the Sadducees over here and they're like yeah there's no afterlife it's just it's it's just God Almighty and you just believe the the laws of Moses and then you have the Pharisees over here and they're teaching in the synagogues and they're teaching like no there is an afterlife and all of them are fighting and all of them disagree and it's like where is the conclusion of the matter as Solomon said in Ecclesiastes what is the conclusion of the matter then this mysterious book this mysterious letter pops up in it's probably in Jerusalem we don't it doesn't have an author most people think it was written by the Apostle Paul some people think it was written by Apollos there's little hints that you can see in it but it doesn't have Paul an apostle of Christ to the Philippians it doesn't have something like that and it doesn't have a signature at the end of this is who I am it's just this this letter that pops up and it's not even really a letter it's a sermon and that's this book of Hebrews so all of these Hebrews around Jesus's time they had seen that this man is the Messiah but what's different how what what's the sum of the matter what's what's the conclusion of all these things and this book of Hebrews answers that question most of the book much of the book is just quoting scriptures and prophecies you don't see it in your book but you can see the little notes that are in there that this book is is introducing people to the end of all things the the introducing to the conclusion which is this man Christ and it's not about boiling a goat it's not about keeping the law law it shows here's why this is the ultimate goal the theme of the book is well brother brandom said it was to separate the prophets from Jesus they're different and as I get through this first chapter you will see that they are very very different people and as I said Hebrews it's it's a sermon it's it's not a letter it doesn't doesn't sound like anything else really written in the Bible it's the theme as I said the first part is to separate Jesus from the prophets and the angels and we see in the entire Old Testament there's a cry out from God for the people to live righteously and to come into fellowship with God but he is a holy God and His presence is Holy nothing un unclean can come into His presence from the fall in the Garden of Eden and Moses on Mount siai where the people didn't want to hear God speak they chose a man to mediate for them and it's always been the desire of God to Fellowship directly with his people and it has been their their his desire always let's say this before we get into Hebrews one thing that I see not just in our circles but especially in our circles the enemy is trying to fool us into not Desiring the baptism of the Holy Spirit and it's you're special you have a special Revelation you're the elite you're the bride you're all of these things and what does it do it pulls away that burning desire to fall down at the altar and to give your heart to the Lord Jesus and to say Lord fill me with that spirit and this book of Hebrews it's introducing that spirit and that Messiah to these people they had already had a little Foundation but now Paul is or whoever the author of this is saying that now I'm going to show you that this is actually the conclusion of all things this is what you've been praying for this is what the goat and the pot this is what it's about the scapegoat in the in I believe it's in Leviticus when they send out one goat and they keep the other and kill that one it's about Christ the whole Book of Leviticus every single sacrifice every single offering is about Jesus this is the conclusion of all things Hebrews 1 watch how he introduces this God who at Sund drry times and in diverse manner spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high that is the conclusion of the matter the letter gets right to the point as I said this is a sermon and it's one of the most powerful sermons ever preached back to verse one God who at Sund drry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets saying God who in old times and in many ways spoke in the past to the fathers to our ancestors by the prophets remember the story on Mount Si where they were there were thundering and smoke and it was given to Moses the Ten Commandments and the people were afraid they didn't want to approach God so they cried out let Moses the prophets speak and not God lest they die the author is saying that God spoke to the in the past through their ancestors by the prophet but now they have the opportunity for him to speak directly to them hath in last hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things and by whom also he made the worlds now the author is raising the stakes this is a man he's saying that you have heard is the Messiah but he's more than a deliverer as you've been taught he's more than a prophet like Moses he's God's own son this is what is being introduced by the author to these Hebrew people John 3:16 Says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved back to Hebrews verse three who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the Angels you'll see a theme as we get through Hebrews he was better he was better than the prophets he was better than the angels He was better than men he just better he was everything about him was better as he by as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they for under which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be a to him a father and he shall be to me a son he's quoting scriptures there were a lot of Angels in the Old Testament as we all know Isaiah heard the seraphim singing Holy Holy Holy the the burners that that had the fire of God the angel that came to Jacob and wrestled with him all night the death angel that came to Egypt when Moses was there and killed all the firstborn the archangel Michael and Gabriel they're all through the Bible and the people they started lifting the Angels up almost like they were God and some of them even worshiped the Angels like God Scofield's comments if you have a skolfield Bible says this the Old Testament expression the angel of the Lord usually expresses deity in Angelic form so you can see how much these angels meant to these people so the author is saying that this man who came he's not like an angel he's far greater than that for unto which verse five for under which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be a father to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship him so these angels that were basically deity Angelic form they are also worshiping this man he is so great he is even worthy of the worship of a sinless angel so the author again he's separating Jesus from the prophets he's SE separating Jesus from the angels and the angels and of the angels He saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but under the sun he saith thy Throne oh God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom I want to stop there for a minute and we we'll take a little detour because I want to teach on this book of Hebrews right here the author lifts up Christ to God he says thy Throne oh God is forever I want to talk about two um different denominations that are in the world today and that's that's more ISM and that's um Jehovah Witness now both of these Michael I hope that you're not either one of them but if you are you'll learn um the uh the translations the King James was was translated and it's usually that I read in this church it's but it's 500 years old the English is our English has changed since and and many of the words don't mean the same that's why I sometimes mention other translations um just the way we speak my my favorite is the King James it's beautiful it's very poetic and and it's just beautiful the way that it's written I believe it is per perfectly accurate but our language may not be as perfectly accurate as the King James is um so I also mentioned the English Standard Version it's a little bit more literal translation than even the king Jame James is the NIV the NLT um and the new King James they're all different translations but I want to mention how the Mormons do and what they what they do is they they had a statement that says that they have this Book of Mormon they have other holy books that they call them and what they do is they put these other books over the Bible and it says this in Joseph Smith's article of fa faith for the Mormons it says we believe the gift of tongues prophecy Revelation Visions healing interpretation of tongues and so forth we believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God so when you talk with the so right here it says we believe the Book of Mormon we believe the Bible if if it's translated right so what they will tell you is the Bible's been translated over and over and over again so much of the meaning behind the Bible has been Lost in Translation because of all the different translations that have come forth you know that's not true the Bible's only been translated once if you look at the King James version it was translated from the original manuscripts the original Greek then the original original Hebrew English Standard Version was translated from the original Greek the original Hebrew they're not translated from each other they are translated from these original Scrolls that were found and these original Scrolls in Hebrew and Greek and and however the original language was written they are almost perfect there are thousands of Scrolls that they have found both in caves and in archaeology and they look at these and they all almost say exactly the same thing sometimes there's a a slip of a pen or sometimes there's a um a typo but these have been TR these have been preserved by the hand of God through these men called scribes and they were very very careful in how they copied each manuscript and then distributed them so when someone tells you that oh the Bible's been translated over and over and over again it hasn't it's only been translated once and it was translated from the original no matter really what Bible that you use whether it's a King James the English Standard Version the NIV these are original documents original translations if you translated from German or if you took the English and and made it match today then then it it would have error in it but it doesn't you know you can say words you can say things differently but that's just fundamentally that's that's a wrong statement to make and then the Jehovah Witness and I'm not really trying to pick on anybody but I just want to tell you how important it is for you to know this word so the Jehovah Witness they have their own Bible let me find it here and you know that they deny the deity of the Lord Jesus and I just read that scripture in Hebrews 1 18 here's the English Standard Version it's says but of the son he says your throne oh God is forever and ever the scepter of right un the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom just using different words to say the exact same thing but the New World Translation says this but about the son he says God is your throne forever and ever and the scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of righteousness they changed the Bible the very Bible itself because the Jehovah Witness Doctrine does not put Jesus as Divine so we'll just change it because it can't it can't be right because it doesn't match our way of thinking so the conclusion of the matter for all of these churches and all of these denominations the conclusion of the matter it's not having the word of God as the absolute it's having our church as the absolute and the way that we things see things as the absolute and then we will actually take the words of God and twist them to make them match our doctrines so what is the end of things when we try to convert someone the end of things is are we converting them to a Jehovah Witness Doctrine or are we converting them to Christ are we trying to get them the to think the way we think or we trying to get them to speak directly to the Lord Jesus tell you the end of all things or the conclusion of the matter as it says in the Book of Ecclesiastes this is the last thing William Brandon wrote this is the conclusion of his ministry this is a conclusion of the matter with him he says this in an exposition of the seven Church ages he says not for one moment do I bring a message that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may you rejoice and may his coming Rejoice your heart look at the similar similarities of brother brandham and that book he even titled the Ser even titled a sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed look at the similarities there it's the same Spirit he's trying to get the people to come to the Lord Jesus but then what do the people do they make pots and pans and separate them and he says you're the Lord's says you don't get it it's all about Christ it's all about this dialogue between us and the Lord Jesus the conclusion of the matter of the book of Hebrews is that Christ is exalted to the throne of God not through a denomination not through a church and not through their understanding of the law back to verse eight but unto the son he saith thy throne oh God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou Hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and thou Lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thy hands they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they shall all wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy years shall not fail later on in the book of Hebrews we'll read that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and he's saying that all these things we see around us will pass away our clothes will wear out and we'll get new clothes and the church will one day this church will one day it'll be reduced to dust it's going to it's it's one day it will be it's not eternal etal it'll burn like everything else will burn but this God is the same and he never changes and this man Jesus Christ this author is saying that you have been introduced as the Messiah he is God in human flesh and the whole book continues on about that and we'll close if the musicians can come verse 13 but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation chapter two therefore we ought to give the most Earnest the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we shall let them slip these people had heard that the Messiah was coming and now the author that is saying that you should give the most Earnest heed to these things that you have heard that's why coming together is important that's why worshiping together is important later in the book that we say that we should not neglect our assembling together as the manner of some is but we encourage one another especially as we see the day approaching we should take this word the author is saying more seriously it's more than life and death it's Heaven and Hell I know that a lot of churches don't talk about hell because oh it's a I Jesus let me tell you something you probably didn't know Jesus talked more about hell than he did Heaven Jesus Christ did there is a hell there is a punishment and the Lord does not want us there remember I've said before that Jesus voted for me Satan voted against me and now I have the deciding vote who I'm going to vote am I going to take my way with Jesus or am I going to take my way with Satan for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just Rec recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard them so the author here here he's like us he was not present when Jesus was in flesh this is confirmed by when he says it's confirmed To Us by them that heard him so the author here is a convert to Christ probably and he says right here through the witness really of someone else God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to to his own will so how can we neglect how can we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation that was proven by signs proven by wonders with many miracles and many gifts of the Holy Ghost according to the will of God I'm going to take a couple minutes in closing I just say that the prophets are fouble the prophets make mistakes every one of them does every single one did that's why this book of Hebrews was written to separate Christ from the men and to separate Christ even from angels He was greater he was better than all of these but I hear so much criticism today it's on the internet criticizing men of God that mean very much to us criticizing William brandham saying that that he lied that he was a charlatan that he he did all of all of this evil stuff and the the author right here says God also bearing them witness with signs and wonders and diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his will and then we want to attack this man's reputation did he make mistakes did he exaggerate did he all the do all these things I don't care I really don't care what I know is God was with him and that love that he produced is what I want that relationship that he had is what I want Doug mugh how many people know Doug McHugh Perry green how many people knew Perry [Music] green Carl wheeler my grandfather Welch Evans I don't know maybe the Marriott you did God bless you sister glidewell and brother Rome these people were Witnesses was it Perry green that saw the eyes formed in the sockets Doug McHugh was there had cancer in his eye had dark sunglasses on brother brandom told them not only you have a you have this this thing in your eye that's going to cause you to go blind I don't know if it was a cancer he called it an allergy but you're going blind he said I saw you at the doctor and the doctor said that and further your mother has tumors on her feet how did he know that he said go home your mother will be healed and you are healed in the name of Jesus Christ that is a sign my grandfather Evans I've told you the story he was bitten by a rattlesnake his foot swelling and all of these the these pains going through him brother brandham laid his hands on him and almost as soon as he laid his hands on him he was healed in the name of Jesus Christ Miracle after miracle my other grandfather was healed of stomach problems when he went down there and the prophet discerned him and said here is what your problem is these signs and these wonders they were real they came to show us that God is real that he is alive that he could do whatever we have need of but we have to know the conclusion of the matter which is to come to Jesus Christ don't get caught up in pots and pans come to Jesus Christ that is the conclusion of the matter that's what the whole book is about and this book of Hebrews I can't wait to dig into it further because more and more it talks about how God manifested himself the father in the son for our salvation and that now we can receive his Spirit prise God this book of Hebrews is a masterpiece and I'm so looking forward to teaching on it I'm looking forward to learning about it I'm looking forward to worshiping and let me say once again how shall we verse three how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him how can we neglect God also bearing them witness was with signs and wonders and diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his will it's real God is real and he sends ministers he sends prophets he sends gifts on Earth to manifest himself to draw people to him and not to something else not to some intellectual understanding if you learn God God through an intellectual understanding you can be pulled away from God through an intellectual understanding you must know him in his spirit I must know him in his Spirit he is Everything Jesus Christ is the conclusion of the matter let me read verse one again chapter 1 verse one I can quote it God who at suy times and in diverse manners spake in time past by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he made heir of all things and by whom also he created the world he did everything by this man Jesus Christ he is the conclusion of the matter and the whole Ministry should get us to that conclusion and get us away from The World God loves loved the people and he gave these commandments so they didn't mix with the world so they didn't weren't influenced by the world but what did they do they washed pots and pans and sinned that is not the intent Jesus said he says I didn't come to do away with the law I came to fulfill the law it all comes down to Jesus Christ I love him do you love him brothers and sisters if I could do anything if the Lord would allow me one thing in my life if I could truly help develop a relationship between the people in this room and Jesus Christ even if it's just one if it's just one it's worth more than 10,000 worlds and my life would be [Music] complete the conclusion of the matter is Jesus Christ is the Fulfillment of this book and he is alive today he's not dead he heals the sick he raises the Dead the gospel has the gospel preached to the poor he is the king of kings the Lord of lords the Mighty God it's Him worship Him and don't neglect what you've heard because there is salvation there we love the Lord we love his servants and let me tell you I am sick and tired of people talking about William Brandon I uh he was a good man he meant a lot to me and like I said I really could care less of the weaknesses he had you'll never hear me say them a lot of ministers will get up there and say oh well you made a mistake here and here and here those mistakes don't matter brother Rome your mistakes don't matter mine don't matter God can take our mistakes and make them stepping stones for others I love the Lord so much let's all stand Blessed assurance [Music] Jesus is mine oh what a foraste of Glory Divine of [Music] Salvation purchase of God born of his [Music] spir washed in his blood this is my story this is my story oh this is my song Oh praising my saor all the day long this is my story oh this is

[Music] soul oh this is my song I'm praising My Savior all the day long this is is my story oh this is my song I'm praising my saor all the day long brothers and sisters how shall we escape if we neglect so great of Salvation we have truly seen great things in this age and I want to make sure when we get to Hebrews chap 13 verse 8 it says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the same God that Barry green saw the same God that Welch Evans Saw the same God that Doug McHugh saw same God that Carl wheeler saw is the same God that is with us today and he changes not and his name is Jesus he came to Earth in the flesh and he led captivity captive and he gave gifts to Men He gave gifts to us and we should have the faith that God will answer our prayers just as he answered the prayers of others in the past so brothers and sisters as you go today think about the power of God and think about how the conclusion of the matter this is the matter this is everything the conclusion of everything is Jesus Christ he did it he is everything he's our Lord he's our savior he's our healer and he is alive brother Dan he's alive today and he loves us let's all bow our [Music] heads Heavenly Father we are thankful Lord for your word and father we're thankful that this word is not dead it's not just words on a page but Lord it is alive today Lord you gave it to us

by giving you our hearts giving you our lives or being baptized in your name test testifying to others praying for one another Lord all of these things you commanded us to do we want to do them that we might live Lord in your will and in your way that we might have that relationship that personal relationship that all men have sought that they might be able to speak to God and have him speak back
