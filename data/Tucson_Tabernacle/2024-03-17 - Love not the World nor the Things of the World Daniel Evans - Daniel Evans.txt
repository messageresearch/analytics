amen before we dismiss the children to the to their Sunday schools just got a couple announcements after service Brothers have asked that we just let all the parents and the children know not to play

can play there as well let's just try to keep the plane minimal in the fellowship hall and um starting also on Wednesday night the fellowship hall is going to be closed and sealed off for some uh

and we were upstairs in the youth room and we were practicing some songs and he says I'm going to go out in front and see if I got a captive audience and he goes out there and just starts preaching to them and talking to them and I think that's a a good attitude to have that you know maybe you're not brave enough to go engage with them but maybe it'll give you a perspective and say Lord help that person and maybe that will be what changes them and maybe they'll come in to this house and be changed we've been changed amen amen the Lord knows everything we're going to dismiss the children now on

worship together and brothers and sisters I say it probably every Sunday let's never take it for granted that that we have a place to worship that that we can we can all gather together and the love that's in this church and and we are fighting we're not this this life that we are living right now it's not what it seems we're fighting against we're not fighting against flesh and blood like we see in the Old Testament we're fighting as the Bible says we're fighting against spirits that influence us that influence us to hate our Brethren that that that teach us to judge one another that that teach us to to Really you see the churches that it drives divisions in between us and we judge people on exclusive doctrines or or the clothes that we wear or the churches that we attend and really we are fighting spiritual wickedness in high places it's not human wickedness it's the spiritual wickedness that influences us to immorality or self-righteousness or or hatred and it's really it influences us to the darkness of this world I want to talk this morning about really about about the difference between darkness and and light and we brother Jordan sang that song that we there's a city where the lamb is the light it's scriptural it's it's from The Book of Revelation and in the Book of Revelation there's there's coming this city the Earth will be wiped clean of sin and there's this coming this city that's going to be built on this mountain that's four square and the Lamb of God will be at the top and and there won't be a sun there won't be a moon there won't be an ocean it's going to be the lamb is the light and you thinking as a scientist you you think how how could that be that this lamb will be the light it'll light up the whole world brother Andrew I bet you there's not even a shadow in the whole city there's going to be some way that this light just covers everywhere and it's going to be the purest light ever and it's just going to always illuminate this world that we're we're coming to but right now we should be representing that light to the world I look at uh Melissa God bless you it's good to have you I didn't notice you there um our church if we are not representing this light brothers and sisters our church would become stagnant and and would stop growing I don't understand how we can be Christians and how we can be excited about what we believe and our church not continue to grow I don't see it I don't see I don't see how we could be in the Lord's will I see right now I see us witnessing to our neighbors and bringing our neighbors in and witnessing to friends and bringing those friends in and the visitors and that's the way it should be and it shows that we are excited about this gospel that's being preach this gospel that is represented by us but so often people aren't excited they're not proud of what they believe they're almost ashamed to bring somebody to church that's not that's not how we should be I was praying this whole week and I was I was thinking about that green banana that I talked about last week and I was watching that crazy bunch of bananas there up on my refrigerator and they're just not ripening looking at things say these things and what happened was they were just picked too early they weren't developed yet and they might eventually ripen but what I was talking about last week is laying in the presence of the Sun and ripening and I was I was this week praying about our church and a church nowadays churches all over the United States they're defined by they're defined by their pastor and then they're defined by their music and you go and you visit from church to church and you you think okay well I like the way this pastor preaches or I like this music but wouldn't it be wouldn't it be wonderful if our church church was defined by the desire of the people that is in their hearts to be right with God that are seeking God that are that are expressing the Lord Jesus Christ to where you come in and you say those people are searching those people are trying to get closer to God I want to be part of that instead of relying on what comes from the pulpit the pulpit is important I understand that but it's for the people the people are the church not the pastor not the music those things are wonderful and we appreciate the Lord blessing us and and continuing to get better but it's about the people that are there and can you imagine if everyone here had a Ministry we should no matter who you are you're not too old when you retire it means you have more time now it's up to you what you're going to do with that time you're going to Ser are you going to serve the Lord more as as I said our church should be growing I look back brother Wilson the day the isua Street Revival they came in and there was a there was one man that that that was maybe a catalyst for it this William Seymour but it was the people people that they prayed and there was people in the church 24 hours a day really excited about what they were doing and it goes back to the day of Pentecost the same thing there these people had something real they had walked into the light and we come to this church and it should be a house of correction it should be it should correct sin but it it's not just for correction for the new Believers it's not just for correction for the people who are outwardly sin sinning it's for correction also for those that have been here for 50 years for those that have been a part of the of the message or the church for all of these years they need correction too and I'm one of them I was born in this but we should always be willing to take that correction and if we don't we deceive ourselves and we walk in what the Bible calls darkness and we get wrapped around the different doctrines and the different groups and the different leaders and we forget that in this world as I said there are powers of light and there are powers of darkness and both are influencing us so what is what is this Darkness all all the way back to the very beginning of the Bible Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was void and without form and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved over upon the face of the waters and they then things began to change something very important happened on at that time after this Spirit moved across the face of the deep and across the waters then God separated the light from the darkness and from that point how many years ago we don't know but from that point Darkness and Light could not coexist exist they were forever separated at that time and we look today and you can have be in the darkest of rooms and if you just even light a match the darkness will flee from that match and it can't it can't be together and it'll it'll light many times it it can light the whole room just one little candle Proverbs chapter 4 verse 18 says this but the path of the just is as The Shining Light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day The Way of the Wicked is as Darkness they know not at what they stumble so when we think of darkness in the Bible we we think of sin but it's not that don't all of us you think well this person is walking in darkness or or you think of the many times it's mentioned it's not sin there's a difference between darkness and sin Darkness means you don't know where you're going you don't have leadership in your life you're just walking along and you're bumping into this and you're bumping into that and you're going through life without a focus without anything lighting your path and it may be a religious system that you're in and you just walking along and you see people that they don't they don't really want to walk in the light they're they're teaching their children to live certain ways they may teach them to be good people or they may they may teach them to be successful but the light is not where they want to go because it might condemn them and by our own choice we seek answers and many times we seek the answers in the darkness of our own minds and of our own reason rather than seeking the answers in the light of God and brothers and sisters every one of us here struggles we all struggle with sin but before you came into the light let me ask you and think about this before you came came into the light of the Holy Spirit did you struggle with sin no you didn't care you just went out and you sinned and you you did you you ruined your life or or you caused problems in your life and then when you come back and when you come into this light now you start struggling with sin because this light tells you now what sin is from everything in your life from A to Z this light of the holy spirit will tell you what sin is now let's go I'm going to be speaking about today about this Apostle John and I'm going to we'll start in the Gospel of John and then we'll move on to um John's first letter so let's turn to John 3 the Gospel of John 3:14 and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God this is an exclusive religion brothers and sisters and no one else is included in this statement from the Lord Jesus it is to believe on Jesus Christ and him only it's not any other Savior and this is the condemnation that the light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil it's hard for a Christian to imagine that that this spirit is among us we immediately think of someone who's cheating on their wife or or going to bars or sleeping around but those who love to walk in darkness they they don't want the light to be turned on because they like the way that they're living and I'm not just talking about the obvious as they keep saying I'm talking about the people who come to church but they get offended at the word when it calls them self-righteous or they dis or disagrees with their own way of thinking people want to come to church and call Jesus their savior we all do but they don't want him to be their lord and ruler in every aspect of their life for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved you don't have to come to this church this church you don't have to come here to be a Christian I'm not saying that you don't have to there's no specific church that that God just deals specifically with it is through his son Jesus Christ but I have invited people to this church and they have there's a two-fold reason that they have not come now they weren't going to other churches it wasn't trying to pull them from somewhere else they weren't going to church but the first one is because they didn't want to change their life they knew what the church stands for they didn't want to come here and then change the what they're doing on the weekends change their their sinful living they wanted to go if they going to go to church they're going to go to another church that accepts that and doesn't say anything about it and in doing so they're walking in darkness the light is there to tell them what's true but they want they choose to walk in this Darkness that's that I'm saying I'm not talking about this this specific Church I'm talking about a church that truly preaches the word of God that people don't want to be part of because they would have to change their lives and then there's others that come that they genuinely are how do I say it without offending a lot of people they're they're genuinely they're self-righteous and they might come to the church and say oh you don't they don't teach this they don't look like they should here he the the pastor doesn't preach hard enough against this and in doing so they are lifting themselves up and they're putting out everything else like the Pharisees like the Sadducees and this is who Jesus is talking to right here he's talking to a Pharisee when he's when he's speaking these words and they think that they're too good and in doing so they are sinning just like the one over here that wants to keep going to the bars they're doing the same thing and then they choose a church that doesn't condemn them for being that sinful person of a self-righteous self-righteousness verse number 21 one but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be manifest may be made manifest that they are wrought in God so friends our F our light as I said should be shining all the time the world sees sees us but through our Deeds it see it sees us and we're doing things by the spirit of God now let's go to John 12:46 the Lord Jesus says this I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness the same one that wrote those words is the same one that separated the light from the darkness in the Book of Genesis is the same one that brother Jordan was singing that song that um there's a city where the lamb is the light he is that light light and he came here and like he did with the Apostle John John witnessed this light I want to talk about John for a minute while just trying to get into the spirit here this man John he was a young man a disciple of the Lord he was a disciple of John the Baptist and John the Baptist taught him he said sat under his ministry and then when John the Baptist saw Jesus John said John the Baptist said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world and this young man John who I'm talking about right now he and Andrew sees John the Baptist say this and he goes and then he follows this Jesus that John the Baptist was talking about and then he became very close to the Lord he was the one that laid on Jesus's chest in the last supper and he was the one that was exiled to the island called patmas he was the one that was boiled in oil and they couldn't kill him and he was the one that lived to be an old man and he writes this epistle 1 John chapter CH one he says this that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life so he's saying that hey I saw this man I was with him and you know who John was John was probably the last person on Earth that was ever with Jesus Christ when he wrote this letter later on I believe is uh in chapter 2 he says he says I am the Elder and he really was the Elder he was the oldest one everybody else had been killed Paul had been executed Paul wasn't with Jesus but Paul had had his head cut off Peter was crucified all of these other ones had been put to death and he was the one that was left brother brandom talks about him and he says that and this is also in historians have written this too that John would preach and he would say little children just love one another just love each other don't don't don't argue don't bicker just be one together for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which is with which which with the Father which was with the father and was manifest manifested to us so John's talking about this eternal life which was with the father and was manifested through his son Jesus Christ there's a lot of misconception about forgiveness and about salvation in the world and and as probably many people here probably don't understand what this idea of Christ is God is a God of Justice which means if someone sins or if there's a crime committed or if there is a debt that debt must be paid God wouldn't be a righteous God if he said don't worry about the debt you're forgiven uh just don't do it again that's not a God of Justice a just God requires payment 100% of the time all the time if you sin or if I sin God requires an atonement for that sin all the time he is just and that's why I can forgive you he you can you can do something to me and I can say oh you're forgiven but God requires an atonement for that so right remember this payment was in his son Jesus Christ when he died on the cross the song what does how does the song go he He Paid a Debt he did not owe I I owed a debt I could not pay God the father he required payment but Jesus was able to make an atonement for that so that's Christianity in a in a nutshell so when we understand that he someone has to pay for our sins do we really want to sin do we really want to put the Lord through that when we know that that he was the atonement that he died on the cross for me he made all of this efforts for me and and made all of this sacrifice and then I want to go and I want to sin more just so he will atone for it that's not a Christian that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you ye Also may have Fellowship that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him no Darkness at all remember Darkness and Light Co cannot coexist they're separated from the beginning by by by definition darkness is the absence of light so if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth don't assume as I said don't assume that walking in darkness is walking in sin when you're walking in darkness you have no Direction Darkness brother and sisters darkness is way worse than sin do you remember the story that brother Bram tells when he was in Memphis and he was walking along the the road and he had to catch a flight and he was singing I think he was singing one of them I'm one of them and something told him to just keep walking brother L you sing a song about it he goes and he sees this this black lady there and she knows him because she had seen a dream about him the night before and her son it's probably in his late teens I would guess was dying of a venial disease and he's laying in the bed out of his mind and he's clutching the blanket and he's saying it's dark it's dark you can see that that darkness is something far worse than sin when brother brandom had when he went on the other side when he was under anesthesia and he was being operated on his leg and remember he went to hell and he said it was all it was Darkness he said he cried out for his mom and there was no Mom there he cried out for his daddy there was no Daddy there he said he cried out for God and there was no God there that's what hell is it's this it's this never ending it's this darkness that we that that we choose to go to when we have fellowship and John talks a lot about Fellowship here when we have Fellowship we want to fellowship with those that are in the light not not cut people out but we want that light to be around us when we're fellowshipping I was I'm building a house and I uh walked in and brother Dan the uh the drywall guys were fighting with the electricians and it was bad I could hear it outside and uh obviously well the drywall guys didn't speak very good English but they spoke enough English to uh to say things that they shouldn't have been saying the electricians they they were they they spoke English so they were going back and forth and I walk into my house and there's my general contractor and he's sitting there and he's just watching these guys and he doesn't know what to do do and when I walked in they kind of quieted it down so I go I go to the electrician and and what had happened is the drywall guys they were young they were kids and they were hanging the sheetrock and they poked holes in the ceiling in places that the electrician didn't want the wires to come through and it was terrible it was all off and and the electricians were mad they were like they shouldn't have poked any holes we go in there and we have everything mapped out so I was like listen I told the electrician I said listen it was my fault I said I was here when those guys were there I said they're kids I was here when they were cutting the holes and I said it was my I should have known better I knew the lights weren't going to W to go there and they even looked at me and asked me a couple questions and and I said it's my fault and the electrician was like oh all right well you know well we'll fix it we'll we'll get it all right you know so they get in there the electrician go up they stuff the wires back in there and then the drywall guys patch it then I go over to the drywall guys and they're like they're they're they're mad at these guys and I said listen I said I was here when you were hanging the sheetrock I said it's my fault I should have told you not to poke any holes and just let leave the leave the wires up there and then they well well we're sorry we we shouldn't have done it so so then calm down and then they start working and they start talking and and things get better so I go to my general contractor and really this was all his fault you guys know Michael he's not here right no if he's sorry Michael if you're streaming in so so Michael said he said Daniel he says I've never seen anything like that he says everything just calms right down and I said I said Michael I said listen I said this wisest man that had ever lived King Solomon said he said a soft answer turns away wrath and Michael's like wow he says he says you know that Bible he says I never knew that stuff like that was in I said I said Michael it's it's our whole life everything that's in this Bible is just filled with wisdom and we can live our whole life by by by just watching this and reading it and then applying it to every aspect of our life and as I was thinking about this whole situation I was like Lord that worked out well um why did it work out so well and like I said this was not my fault the contractor he should have known and and the kids hang in the drywall they should have known not to punch these holes in there and pull the wires out electrician he was just he's a hotthead he was he was mad and when I thought about it what diffused the whole situation is that I was a man of authority and I took the blame even though it wasn't my fault but look at the Spirit of Christ in a Christian don't always think that if it's someone else's fault that you can't take the blame Jesus Took the blame for you and if we have the spirit of Christ then we can also take the blame for other people but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin remember God requires payment he requires somebody to take the blame if we say that we have no sin then we deceive ourselves and the truth and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins to cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord I'm walking in your light it doesn't mean that I don't sin it means that the Holy Spirit Within Me corrects me of my sins and I repent and when I Repent I ask God to forgive me and he does because of Jesus Christ if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us so who's John talking to here he's he's talking to he's writing this letter to Believers and he's telling people that if you walking in sin that there's no light in you and you make God a liar if you say that you are you have no sin have you ever met someone that says they have no sin I haven't everybody say oh well I sin well what do you do well um and then they'll come up with some little thing but they have the attitude of someone that doesn't sin they have the attitude of being better than someone else but if you commit there are there are different sins and people say that oh well every sin's the same every sin is not the same every sin will send you to hell but some sins have a greater magnitude and a greater effect on you than other sins have if you go and you cheat on your wife or you come you rob a bank or you Mur murder someone that has a lot stiffer consequences in the flesh but if you tell this you know a white lie or or or you do something that is wrong but it doesn't have the consequences you don't have to suffer the consequences as much in the flesh however all sin whether it's the lowest or the highest can send you to hell and just because you commit a little sin don't think that you're better than someone else because you might be committing the greater sin in self-righteousness or living like the Pharisees I'll hurry up let's go to um chapter two my little children these things write I onto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the perpetuation of our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world Jesus is not exclusive to a denomination or a sect or a cult or a certain group of people even if they believe Malachi 4 he is not exclusive to them he's just too big for our religion we can't put him in a box and limit it to one little group of people he died for the sins as John said of the entire world and it is our responsibility to get the world to him and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments so if we take the law and we apply it to our lives we apply what Jesus said to our lives and we don't say well it's not a big deal if I do this but it's a big deal if you do that we're not keeping the Lord Jesus's Commandments we keep all of his commands Commandments and friends don't think I'm preaching something different here than brother Brandon preached every sermon he wanted us to follow Jesus Christ what we have done is we've taken little things and we have made dogmas out of those things but listen to him yourself it is to be applied to every aspect of Our Lives from when we wake up in the morning to when we go to bed at night if our message becomes a set of Creeds then the sin and darkness really the sin and darkness they really follow it removes the Holy Spirit out of the out as leadership of the individual we um we when we were in Jeffersonville we um had we started the young foundation's um youth ministry and and it was really going good all these kids are they're really they're they're really excited about serving the lord and this was when the social media started going do you remember what Myspace is well Myspace comes out and Brother Joseph brandham he was like this is just this is not good and we were all talking it's like this is this is just you can tell this is not going to end well so Brother Joseph starts telling the kids hey preaching against mypace and we all start saying hey don't don't this Myspace thing don't get caught up into that so then they say okay we won't we're doing what Brother Joseph said and then they go to Facebook and it's like what are you guys doing and then say something about that then they go to this then they go over here to that they didn't catch the vision I'm not preaching against social media but we all know the Perils of social media they didn't they it it became a rule and rule rules bring in sin that wasn't the purpose of it the purpose of it was to watch this because the enemy can use these things let's skip down to uh verse 11 but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that Darkness has blinded his eyes again walking in darkness doesn't mean that you're walking in sin it means that you can't see your sins I write unto you the little children because your sins are forgiven you of his for his name's sake I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because you have known the father how encouraging I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men in because you are strong and the word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him so brothers and sisters if we're looking at the world for our example of course then we're patterning ourselves after the world I want to get down to um verse uh let's go down to verse 25 and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life these things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you you shall abide in him and that's what I want to concentrate on for the next couple minutes as we as we wind it down as we close that John is telling us to let the Holy Spirit lead in every aspect of our lives and if you have the Holy Spirit then you are able to abide in Christ in all things and many churches are all about rules there that that you cut this length this this this is appropriate this isn't appropriate and when we do that Heath we take out the Holy Spirit out of the equation many times not many times a couple times I've had people ask me be more specific when you're talking about what we should and what we shouldn't do brothers and sisters I can't do that John right here is teaching the exact opposite of that because when I teach that if I had if I was teaching specifics like don't do this do that then I would allow sin to come in to the congregation and take out the holy spirit in the individual that that Holy Spirit will make you more holy than if you have a set of Creeds or dogmas for the church that's what people don't understand it's all about this Spirit as John is saying here that this spirit is going to teach you you don't need that any man teach you it doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a preacher up here teaching the Bible it doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a pastor pointing you in the right direction that's not what it means but it means that you don't need someone to teach you in every aspect of your life because that is the role of the Holy Spirit one example examp le as we close and the musicians can come one example I want to read of brother brandom it's so easy for us to divide the Mormons will divide on Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon the 7eventh day Adventist they will divide on worshiping on Saturday and if you don't adhere to that then you're cut out again it takes out the Holy Spirit from the individual brother brandom said this in questions and answers now first question I pulled out of here brother brandom is it wrong for a Christian to put her hair in pin curls also what length should her sleeves be thank you a sister that's a pretty common question can we wear this sleeve oh should I wear that or is this is um is this knit skirt okay or is is is this jean skirt all right right questions all the time about that listen to way the prophet answers it he he talks about the pin Cur the uh the whatever they're called he didn't know what they were either um but he didn't um and uh the links of the sleeves I think being a Christian God would tell you what to do about those things you see I believe as a Christian person you know about how to do that I don't think God Cuts any certain links or whatever it is as long as you're decent and look honorable and clean I think that's all right don't you look at the wisdom that brother brandom speaks because if he would cut a length we are people we would find a way to stick sin in there I talked with uh years ago husband and a wife was was uh talking with them and the sister the the husband said he says you know he says the woman's dress he says it's not that's not what gets you to heaven and the wife she snaps back at her husband and she says well why don't I just put on a short skirt and high heels and and just strut around like that and then I believe believe the lord gave me the answer I said sister I said why would you want to look like that I said what is in you that would want to look so much like the world there's something there's something there and the the answer is she had not gone far enough her Holiness was a self-righteous Holiness but her own testimony said that she was walking in darkness because the Lord wasn't dealing directly with her she had not I could tell she did not have that experience pure religion brothers and sisters pure religion requires a complete surrender to God in every aspect of Our Lives from the way we dress to the way we talk to the to how we earn our money everything requires a complete and utter surrender and if we're trying to go by what the pastor says and trying to cut certain links and cut certain lines it will bring in sin and then we'll be just walking around in darkness and now little children verse 28 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at is coming if ye know that he is righteous ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of [Music] him and praying about this sermon and and talking about the difference between light and darkness and and talking about loving the world or the things that are in the world brothers and sisters there's so many times that we really don't know what to do we really don't understand things we say God where are you am I even right is is what's what's going on here I feel like I'm just walking around through this world and I just don't understand things I don't know if anyone else has had that feeling but it's really it's common but the bottom line is that light of the holy spirit will light our path if we diligently seek Him imagine it my wife and I were walking the other day and she said imagine if your child was dying and the only way you knew that there was a cure and you had to find some way to get over on the other side of the world say say China to get that vaccine or whatever it was and bring it back to your child and that child would be healed what effort would you make to do it you would do everything that you could but now death and darkness is at the door and we won't make an effort to get on our knees we won't make an effort to reach out to someone who who who is suffering or that is in sin we talk about being Christians but are are we really are we really doing everything that we can I say it all the time we need to do [Music] more Darkness and Light can't abide together and in darkness does not necessarily mean outward sin there's many times that we will go to a church and we want to walk in darkness because we don't want to change and we choose that I hope that everyone considers I was talking with uh brother Sean I see you back there Sean and I were talking the other day outside and there was uh all the kids were out there and everybody was playing and and brother Sean was I like can you imagine can can you believe just how the Lord's blessed us and but Sean said something to me that I mean it meant the world to me he said yeah he says I'm going to hope I get you right when when I say it but if not I'll make you come up here and say it Sean's like um but Sean says that he says yeah I've talked about the church before and some people have said oh you know not not you know not not that church not that and Sean said no he said it's not like that and I it made brother Sean that made me feel so good I want to make sure it's something real and it's not just going through the motions of going to church it's finding God and walking out of Darkness into his glorious light that's what I wanted to be and I believe that's what all of us want we don't want this dark world where we serve ourselves and and we are making all of our decisions even if it's not what we want it to be Lord Let It Be Your Will and not our will let's let's all [Music] stand empty and B Lord he my prayer for more of you more of you I've had it all but what I is more of you of things I've had my f and yet I hunger still empty and be Lord hear my prayer for more of you more of you more of you

come up with close my brother you going to be all right you know you [Music] can't I um brothers and sisters I think the most important thing that we can do is pray yes and I um tonight let's um let's have a prayer service where we we all come and I'll say a few words we'll sing some worship songs and uh then we'll just get quiet before the Lord and pray I had um a lot more in this um in the sermon that I wanted to say but I just felt like the Lord said no let's uh let's stop it there and let's bring the people to pray and to present their lives before the Lord and ask Lord if I am walking in darkness I don't want to walk in darkness I want to walk in this glorious light and I want to I want to give my life over to him and I I want to Lord not lower your word to just a set of Creeds and I ideas but Lord I want your word to live within me yes and I want it to come forth and have your Holy Spirit be the law that is within me I want your Holy Spirit to correct me in all things and Lord I don't want to love the world or the things of the world I want to love you and I want to live a life that's worthy of your gospel if there's something within me if it would be any type of sin Lord take that sin away from me reveal to reveal it to me as as John was saying that you don't need any man to teach you that you need the Holy Spirit to convict you that's all bow our [Music] heads Heavenly Father we're oh I just I almost can't imagine that the the same God that we're praying to now is the same God that John prayed to the same God that John talked about the same Jesus Christ
