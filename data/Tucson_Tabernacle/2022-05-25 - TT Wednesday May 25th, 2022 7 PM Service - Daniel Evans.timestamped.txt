[27:24] bless you
[27:25] oh yeah
[27:27] um
[27:29] what a
[27:30] what a
[27:32] world that we live in
[27:34] now
[27:35] and and what is
[27:37] what's happening in the world and what
[27:39] we're seeing going on
[27:42] is without precedence
[27:44] and it's just
[27:46] it's
[27:47] been on my heart so much
[27:50] over the past few days and thinking
[27:52] about these families that have been
[27:54] have been just destroyed by this
[27:57] horrible thing that's happened in texas
[28:00] and
[28:01] and seeing the many other things that
[28:03] has happened
[28:05] to the to the world
[28:07] and it's it's truly these are perilous
[28:10] times
[28:12] and
[28:13] we know that before the coming of the
[28:16] lord that there are certain signs that
[28:17] we're going to see
[28:19] certain things will be brought before us
[28:22] and they'll be brought before us as
[28:24] signs
[28:25] and if we
[28:26] are in this word
[28:30] and and we're always thinking about this
[28:32] then we'll recognize these signs
[28:35] and when the lord jesus appears
[28:38] to take us away and this rapture happens
[28:41] we'll be ready for it
[28:43] we'll be prepared
[28:45] the bible in the book of revelation says
[28:46] the bride has made herself
[28:49] ready so often we were
[28:53] counting on someone else to make us
[28:55] ready
[28:56] we're counting even on the lord jesus
[28:57] lord jesus make me ready and the lord
[28:59] jesus said i told you to make yourself
[29:02] ready
[29:04] you do all that you can to prepare for
[29:06] the coming
[29:07] be ready and that's what we're seeing
[29:09] now we're seeing things come to light
[29:12] and it's it's uh it's an awful day to
[29:14] live in
[29:16] the bible teaches us that there would
[29:18] become a falling away
[29:22] before the end
[29:23] and i believe friends i believe we're
[29:25] seeing that we're
[29:27] we're seeing uh awful things happen i uh
[29:31] but there is a light
[29:33] at the end of a tunnel
[29:35] and there is a happy ending to the story
[29:37] no matter how bad it is at first
[29:39] a special thing happened to me i'll
[29:41] share it
[29:43] there was um many years ago i'd say it
[29:45] was around in 2012 2013.
[29:50] i was working
[29:52] on a weekend at voice of god and there
[29:55] was another brother
[29:56] that was working there
[29:59] and i was praying i had a place that i
[30:02] would go to underneath the staircase
[30:05] um
[30:06] and i would go in there and pray and i
[30:07] was praying and he really came heavy on
[30:09] my heart what just so happens he was at
[30:11] work
[30:12] and it was it was an off day there
[30:14] weren't people there
[30:16] and
[30:17] i went to his office
[30:19] and i said i said brother i said
[30:23] i feel like you're doubting
[30:27] i feel like that you don't believe this
[30:30] message anymore
[30:32] and
[30:34] he looked at me he said no he says
[30:36] everything's fine
[30:38] and i said well maybe i'm wrong and we
[30:40] talked we talked for a little while
[30:42] longer and he shared some things with me
[30:46] and it just tore my heart out of me some
[30:49] of the things that he was going through
[30:52] and
[30:54] turns out
[30:55] a couple weeks later he quit
[30:58] and
[30:59] he and his wife
[31:01] left
[31:03] brother branham's message
[31:05] they said we don't want anything to do
[31:06] with it anymore
[31:08] and they they can they continued on and
[31:10] they they took the path of of maybe the
[31:13] skeptics
[31:15] and and how that they um they took
[31:18] brother brahm's message and say well
[31:20] there's all these mistakes
[31:22] in it and there's all these things that
[31:23] he he lied about and he said these
[31:25] things that were wrong
[31:27] and they they they went in this
[31:28] direction
[31:30] and
[31:31] and his wife ended up leaving him
[31:34] another man
[31:36] and
[31:37] he just
[31:39] he just his life was it became really
[31:41] hard
[31:42] and
[31:44] i would reach out to him brother lie
[31:45] every once in a while he was always on
[31:47] my heart
[31:48] i would reach out to him every once in a
[31:50] while and and i just sent him a text or
[31:52] i'd call him and he usually wouldn't
[31:53] respond every once in a while he he'd
[31:55] talk to me but he just didn't really
[31:57] want anything to do with me
[31:59] but i didn't let over six months or so
[32:01] go by and i would just send them a text
[32:03] say thinking about you praying praying
[32:05] for you and time went on
[32:08] and
[32:10] he
[32:11] continued on his path i continued on my
[32:14] path
[32:15] and
[32:16] then i was out uh
[32:18] we had a visitor here by the scott
[32:20] winner

[33:52] he had done and is now serving the lord
[33:55] as a strong christian so we should never
[33:58] ever cut someone out we should never say
[34:01] that that oh because
[34:03] i hear so often they went out from us
[34:05] because they were not office you have no
[34:07] way to judge that
[34:09] the bible says judge not that ye be not
[34:11] judged we have no reason we can judge
[34:14] the sin
[34:15] but we cannot judge that sinner
[34:18] and i'm so grateful for that for that
[34:20] story
[34:22] and you know i think
[34:23] i think that this world needs people
[34:26] this world needs people like us
[34:29] people that are sincere people that'll
[34:31] make the effort on a wednesday night
[34:34] for the for the robbers back there to
[34:36] drive as far as you drive
[34:38] to come just on a wednesday night
[34:40] and fellowship with us god bless your
[34:42] loyal hearts every one of you
[34:44] so proud of you it's so good to see you
[34:46] you know you're real servants of the
[34:48] lord standing strong
[34:50] i love that your encouragement to me you
[34:52] really are
[34:53] i'm just i'm grateful for that and i i
[34:56] think that lord what can we do
[34:59] and this world is so built around it's
[35:03] so built around ourselves
[35:05] you know we see iphones and ipods and
[35:08] ipads and ios and i i i everything's
[35:11] about me
[35:13] everything's about whoa i have to love
[35:14] myself and i have to put myself first
[35:18] that is a lie
[35:21] that's what the world tells you but that
[35:23] is not what jesus christ taught and
[35:25] that's why we have so much suicide in
[35:26] the world we have so much depression we
[35:28] have all that because we're putting
[35:30] ourselves first
[35:32] and it's rotten
[35:33] when we start putting other people first
[35:36] like our lord jesus taught us
[35:38] then we will find the joy sister surely
[35:40] it'll just well up within us
[35:43] that's where we will find the joy i
[35:45] remember when i was
[35:46] i was
[35:47] a couple days ago i found this book
[35:51] that um
[35:52] some of the
[35:53] all the employees when i left tucson in
[35:57] 2004
[36:00] all of all the employees they put
[36:02] together and they bound this really nice
[36:04] book for me and had pictures of
[36:05] everybody in there
[36:07] and i was going through it
[36:09] i found it and i i brought it to work
[36:11] and i was going through it
[36:13] and there was a picture
[36:15] of a man a young man he's one of the one
[36:18] of the most talented scientists that we
[36:20] have i work for the government for the
[36:22] department of interior we do
[36:24] environmental research and and climate
[36:27] trends and and water resources and that
[36:29] and he was one of the most up-and-coming
[36:32] scientists
[36:33] that that we had in the government
[36:35] very very bright
[36:37] young man
[36:40] and
[36:40] he ended up committing suicide
[36:43] and i looked at that picture
[36:47] and i thought why did i not see
[36:51] i looked at that picture and i could see
[36:53] that there was pain in that young man's
[36:56] life
[36:57] and i thought why didn't i see that why
[36:59] couldn't his name was jeff why couldn't
[37:01] i see jeff why couldn't i see that he
[37:03] was having trouble at home
[37:05] not because he went to my church or
[37:07] anything else but because he was a soul
[37:09] in need
[37:10] and i look at it i said lord why
[37:12] couldn't i see that why didn't i see it
[37:14] i was too
[37:15] involved in myself
[37:17] in my career
[37:18] and then things going on in my life
[37:21] i was too much about me not to look at
[37:24] this man who was
[37:26] who was in pain
[37:27] he was in dire need
[37:29] i ended up taking his life and i i said
[37:31] lord no more
[37:34] no more i'm tired of serving myself
[37:37] i'm tired of of
[37:40] of the eyes that are in the world i'm
[37:43] tired of all the me
[37:45] that's here i wish i could go back
[37:48] and just
[37:49] put my arm around it take him to lunch
[37:52] spend some time with him
[37:54] but we all have that opportunity now
[37:56] never overlook someone friends it could
[37:59] be at work the vilest sinner
[38:03] but i've seen the vilest sinner come to
[38:04] the lord
[38:06] never overlook anyone always be there
[38:10] god has placed us here
[38:12] he's placed us here
[38:14] according to scripture we see the signs
[38:17] of the times we see this thing that
[38:18] happened in texas that i'm going to talk
[38:20] about in a little bit we see
[38:23] all of this abortion
[38:26] mayhem that's going on i'm going to talk
[38:28] about that in a little bit we see all of
[38:31] these things going on right now these
[38:34] are all signs that we have expected to
[38:36] happen
[38:37] and now they're happening
[38:39] and friends we have a role
[38:42] in all of this
[38:43] and we need to take that role we need to
[38:46] take up our cross and move forward as
[38:49] christ did we are his representatives
[38:52] these are his hands
[38:54] these are his feet this is his mouth
[38:57] that's the way that he does things ever
[38:59] since the day of pentecost that's the
[39:01] way he did it and he's doing it now
[39:04] and we need to take our place and we
[39:06] need to get serious
[39:08] about this if i keep talking about this
[39:10] i'm never going to get to my my
[39:12] scriptures i uh
[39:15] i was
[39:16] i'd go a little bit further i was i was
[39:19] walking
[39:21] i went for a walk the other day i work
[39:24] on campus
[39:25] at the university
[39:27] and
[39:29] it's just an awful place but there's no
[39:31] school going on right now so i decided i
[39:32] was going to go for a walk
[39:34] and and i'm walking i'm walking around
[39:38] and
[39:38] i hear this sound
[39:41] of screaming and hollering a big crowd
[39:46] and
[39:46] i was
[39:48] what is that so it was
[39:50] kind of right my path
[39:51] so i continue on and i'm walking and it
[39:54] gets louder and louder and i hear i hear
[39:56] all this swearing over the uh over the
[39:59] loudspeaker and i get there and there's
[40:01] this
[40:01] giant crowd
[40:03] probably 500 people
[40:06] and they're they're all they're all
[40:08] gathered around
[40:09] and they have all their signs up the
[40:11] most awful looking group of people that
[40:15] you can imagine
[40:16] men with men
[40:19] women with women
[40:21] they're evil signs signs with just
[40:24] things i wouldn't i would never want to
[40:26] repeat
[40:27] to my family
[40:29] saying the most awful things from the
[40:30] loudspeaker
[40:33] and and i go walking by like lord what
[40:35] is this i gotta get to the other side
[40:38] over there so you know i walk walk
[40:40] around
[40:42] and this young woman
[40:45] takes the stage
[40:46] she gets the microphone
[40:49] and
[40:50] she gets up there and she says
[40:53] i am gay
[40:55] non-binary
[40:57] freshman in college
[40:59] and she starts cussing like a sailor
[41:03] it was it was absolutely awful
[41:07] and and the people even the people there
[41:09] were covering their mouths like oh man
[41:11] and this girl's right out of high school
[41:13] and then she makes this statement
[41:15] she says and i'm a christian
[41:18] it's like whoa so i stopped
[41:21] it's like okay
[41:23] you know you just spoke
[41:25] a word of all the words you said you
[41:27] just spoke one that i actually
[41:28] understood
[41:31] so
[41:32] she starts talking this awful talk about
[41:36] abortion
[41:38] and how they have no right to tell us
[41:41] what to do and all of this all of this
[41:44] nonsense this modern nonsense about
[41:49] about uh
[41:51] men and men and women and women and and
[41:53] abortion and how how the white man has
[41:55] no right to tell anybody else and i'm
[41:57] thinking
[41:58] well
[41:59] about a third of these people are
[42:00] actually white men
[42:02] you know but they they were dressed the
[42:05] way they dressed and then a lot of men
[42:07] had makeup on
[42:08] and it was just it was absolutely
[42:11] sodom and gemara
[42:13] and i was standing there
[42:16] and i was afraid
[42:18] not not really afraid i mean i was kind
[42:20] of on guard
[42:22] am i going to take a swing
[42:24] or what but
[42:25] but
[42:27] that
[42:28] evil aggressive
[42:30] spirit
[42:31] was there and it was aggressive
[42:34] it was we are going to come after you
[42:37] violent
[42:38] spirits threatening violence
[42:41] so i listen to this this young woman for
[42:44] a while and
[42:45] and and then i i went my way
[42:49] and i thought you know i thought this is
[42:51] this is a sign
[42:52] of the times
[42:54] and i want to tell you what a prophet
[42:56] said
[42:57] about this subject of abortion just just
[43:00] to to clench it down a little bit sister
[43:03] shirley that he was a prophet
[43:06] because he prophesied you know when when
[43:08] when a prophet is speaking
[43:10] he's speaking in present tense
[43:12] you know and and it was like like isaiah
[43:15] when he said a virgin shall conceive you
[43:16] know the situation that he was in
[43:19] the city was besieged
[43:22] and and and they were in dire need of a
[43:24] savior to come in of a calvary to come
[43:27] in and save the city
[43:29] so the king goes to isaiah and he's like
[43:31] hey hey hey you know pray to god
[43:35] to help us because we've got to get out
[43:36] of here we're starving to death and
[43:38] isaiah says no you pray to god
[43:41] and he says
[43:42] and the king the king says no no ask ask
[43:45] the lord to give you a sign and isaiah
[43:46] said behold the lord will send you a
[43:48] sign
[43:49] a virgin shall conceive a bear and bear
[43:52] a son
[43:53] and they should call his name emmanuel
[43:54] and you know the scripture right in the
[43:56] middle of this
[43:58] this horrible situation
[44:00] and this prophet was speaking for
[44:02] something that was going to happen seven
[44:03] or 800 years later
[44:04] when jesus was born
[44:07] we know that the prophets they speak
[44:10] in present tense
[44:12] and these things may happen thousands of
[44:14] years later let me show you let me tell
[44:16] you what the prophet said just about
[44:17] this
[44:18] the subject
[44:20] of abortion he says this
[44:23] and straight as the gate 1959 my brother
[44:26] do you have it brother jordan
[44:29] he says this
[44:32] he said let let me give you some
[44:34] estimations that'll shake you
[44:37] according to medical science in the city
[44:39] of chicago according to doctor's
[44:41] statistics that there's 30 000 abortion
[44:44] cases in chicago alone
[44:47] and 30 days that the doctors had
[44:50] how many of these little pills and
[44:52] things they take of abortion cases
[44:55] they never had
[44:57] the abortion pill
[44:59] back then
[45:00] it's called prophecy
[45:02] they never had that too recently
[45:04] and here the prophet is just saying like
[45:06] it's going right along and it would be
[45:08] 50 50 years later
[45:10] that this would be fulfilled but i just
[45:13] want to throw that in there
[45:15] this man that we talk so much about that
[45:17] we like to listen to his tapes he was
[45:20] actually a prophet
[45:21] and he spoke things that way back when
[45:25] that are still coming to pass today and
[45:27] they will be for years to come
[45:30] let's turn again i could i could go on
[45:33] and on but let's turn turn to the word
[45:36] luke the 17th chapter
[45:38] and i'm not going to have you stand
[45:40] because i'm just going to keep going on
[45:42] and on
[45:47] brother branham
[45:49] said many times
[45:51] he talked about this luke 17 let's start
[45:53] with verse 26.
[45:55] he talked about this luke 17 and he
[45:57] related it to the ministry of malachi 4.
[46:02] luke 17 26
[46:05] and as it was in the days of noah
[46:08] so shall it be in the
[46:10] so shall it also be so shall it be also
[46:13] in the days of the son of man
[46:15] they did eat they drank they married
[46:17] wives they were given in marriage
[46:20] until the day that noah entered into the
[46:22] ark and the flood came and destroyed
[46:25] them all
[46:26] so they were going along along just like
[46:29] normal
[46:30] normal ways they were in the middle of
[46:32] this sin that was going on
[46:36] and then the flood came let's turn
[46:39] keep your finger in luke
[46:41] and then i'm going to be turning back
[46:43] and forth let's turn to genesis chapter
[46:44] 6.
[46:46] now our lord jesus says he's talking
[46:47] about this in luke he's referring back
[46:50] to the story of noah
[46:53] and we go in genesis
[46:56] chapter 6
[46:59] now listen to this
[47:02] the lord jesus prophesied
[47:05] of his second coming
[47:08] here's what was going on
[47:10] in noah's day
[47:13] verse 10.
[47:17] and noah begat three sons shem ham and
[47:19] jabeth
[47:21] the earth also was corrupt before god
[47:25] and the earth was filled with violence
[47:30] today
[47:33] and god looked upon the earth and behold
[47:34] it was corrupt for all flesh had
[47:37] corrupted his way upon the earth
[47:39] and god said unto noah the end of all
[47:41] flesh has come before me for the earth
[47:44] is filled with violence
[47:46] through them
[47:48] and behold i will destroy them with with
[47:50] the earth
[47:53] and then he talks about the ark
[47:57] now we look
[47:58] at this mass killing that happened in
[47:59] texas i think it's i think that i hadn't
[48:01] checked the news today i think the
[48:03] number was 19
[48:04] 19 kids 19 children
[48:08] killed and then and then at least two
[48:09] adults
[48:11] were also killed
[48:12] and i
[48:13] i don't know anything about this this
[48:15] young man that that killed these
[48:18] children
[48:19] but i'd be willing to guess that he
[48:21] didn't have a godly mother or a godly
[48:23] father
[48:25] i'd be willing to guess that he didn't
[48:27] have a good home life
[48:30] you know when we look we look at the
[48:31] world today and we look at some of these
[48:33] things that happen
[48:35] with with these young people with this
[48:37] this murderer
[48:39] where are his parents
[48:41] where are the ones that raised him
[48:44] the parents so often we hear about
[48:46] divorce and we hear about we hear about
[48:48] splitting up and it's we we see that
[48:51] even the parents it's all about me
[48:54] it's about i
[48:55] well i just i couldn't get along
[48:57] with your dad
[48:59] you know i just couldn't get along with
[49:01] your mom and then there's there's the
[49:03] children
[49:04] there
[49:05] and who suffers
[49:07] because it's all about me
[49:10] i'll tell you a secret for those of you
[49:12] who who have never gotten married
[49:14] you're gonna argue with your spouse
[49:19] and and when you when you argue with
[49:21] your spouse
[49:22] am i right sister
[49:25] do you ever argue with brother aaron
[49:27] it'll be okay
[49:28] do you
[49:30] i'm just i know you do we all just
[49:33] happens it's okay
[49:36] but we put we don't put each other first
[49:39] when we get into these things
[49:41] it's
[49:42] it's not me we come together as a family
[49:47] and if if these differences become so
[49:49] irreconcilable what about all these
[49:51] babies
[49:52] that we have what about your daughters
[49:54] my sister
[49:56] they're the important and that's why you
[49:58] have such a lovely family excuse you and
[50:00] brother and put them first
[50:02] you put them first and you raise them
[50:04] right
[50:05] and that's where i see this young man
[50:08] he probably didn't have parents that
[50:09] raised him right
[50:11] and i feel bad for him i know he
[50:12] committed a horrible crime
[50:14] but i feel
[50:15] what was his destination he was doomed
[50:17] from the start
[50:19] because of probably
[50:22] he didn't have parents that would put
[50:25] the lord first
[50:30] let's uh let's continue on well let's go
[50:32] to in in talking about that and putting
[50:35] ourselves first let's let's go to
[50:37] philippians 2 3. we're going to remember
[50:39] keep keep your finger there on
[50:42] on luke but let's go to philippians
[50:44] chapter two verse three
[50:46] it says this it says let nothing be done
[50:50] through strife or vainglory
[50:53] but in lowliness of mind
[50:56] let each esteem others
[50:58] better than themselves
[51:00] well what an odd thing to say in this
[51:03] this world of 2022 put the other guy up
[51:05] first don't step in front of him in line
[51:09] let the other guy go i mean we're
[51:10] driving around and you you see you know
[51:13] we're cutting everybody off and going
[51:15] we're christians when we're behind the
[51:16] wheel too
[51:18] let's not forget that
[51:20] we are
[51:21] we're christians all the time and that's
[51:23] what this world is about you know it's
[51:25] it's you know when we're in the car when
[51:27] we're at work
[51:28] or when we're a husband and a wife
[51:31] and they're ready to split up and then
[51:32] there's these babies
[51:34] that are suffering
[51:37] let nothing be done through strife or
[51:38] vainglory verse 4
[51:40] look not every man on his own things but
[51:43] every man also on the things of others
[51:46] don't just worry about yourself
[51:48] worry about that other guy
[51:52] let this mind be in you which was also
[51:55] in christ jesus
[51:57] who being in the form of god thought it
[51:59] not robbery to be equal with god
[52:02] he was god
[52:04] he was there
[52:06] but made himself of no reputation
[52:10] and took upon him the form of a servant
[52:13] and was made in the likeness
[52:16] of men
[52:18] and being found in fashion as
[52:20] a man he humbled himself and became
[52:23] obedient unto death
[52:26] even the death
[52:27] of the cross
[52:30] that was our example we lower ourselves
[52:33] friends and we put others in front of us
[52:36] we were i was over at my mother-in-law's
[52:38] house last night
[52:40] and uh i wanted to watch the news i
[52:42] wanted to see what was going on with
[52:44] this with this thing so so we turned it
[52:46] on there and we had the talking heads
[52:48] and and depending on who you watched
[52:51] there was an angle
[52:52] there was always a political angle you
[52:54] know you go to fox news and here's the
[52:56] here's the guy saying oh the president
[52:58] he's politicizing this and then you see
[53:00] the president up there the democrat and
[53:02] he is politicizing it he said oh we need
[53:04] to take away all the guns and then we
[53:06] see this other guy over here saying that
[53:08] um that that there need to be stronger
[53:11] gun laws and you see the other ones over
[53:12] here no saying we need more guns
[53:14] we need we need guns in the schools with
[53:16] the teachers and all of this and
[53:18] watching this it's like this is
[53:20] ridiculous
[53:22] everybody just wants their own way
[53:24] and then there was a man
[53:26] there was a man that they interviewed
[53:29] nobody really respected him
[53:31] but uh i think i mean it was on fox i
[53:34] think
[53:35] but but they they brought this man up
[53:37] there
[53:39] and this man nailed it he said even on
[53:43] national tv
[53:45] this man gets up there
[53:48] and he says you know he says
[53:49] politicizing all this stuff won't work
[53:52] he said he said you know he says he says
[53:54] throwing money at the schools he said
[53:57] that's not the answer and that's what
[53:58] the republicans wanted to do they want
[54:00] to put money into the into fortifying
[54:02] the schools making them this big
[54:03] fortress
[54:04] and he said taking the guns away from
[54:06] the people that that's not going to work
[54:08] either
[54:09] and then the man said
[54:11] he said something all that something on
[54:13] order of this
[54:14] he says these people need to be in
[54:16] church
[54:18] and serve the lord jesus
[54:21] he said and only then will things change
[54:26] i thought god blessed that man's loyal
[54:29] heart
[54:30] the whole country just heard that
[54:33] and that is the only thing that will
[54:35] change these things it won't be going
[54:38] out brother lyle and voting for the
[54:39] republican it ain't going to matter it
[54:42] won't be voting for
[54:44] for
[54:45] this one or that one and oh boy i hope
[54:46] this one wins in georgia then then we
[54:48] can get the senate back and all this
[54:50] it's all lost
[54:53] it's all fodder it's all going to burn
[54:55] but if you can get that soul to christ
[54:58] if you can get that soul to the lord
[55:00] jesus if you can lift him up then things
[55:02] and only then will things change
[55:05] and they're going to change and then god
[55:07] is going to come down and he's going to
[55:09] grab that bride take her out satan is
[55:12] going to come down the bride's going to
[55:14] go up
[55:16] tribulation's on and we go to the
[55:17] wedding supper and i want more people
[55:20] at supper
[55:22] i want i want as many people around that
[55:24] table as we can get
[55:28] verse 28
[55:30] luke verse 28.
[55:34] in chapter 17.
[55:36] likewise also
[55:38] as it was in the days of lot
[55:40] they did eat they drank they bought they
[55:43] sold they planted they built it they
[55:45] were going along like everyday life
[55:48] living
[55:49] their life
[55:51] with these sins all around them
[55:54] let's say just like lot did
[55:56] as the lord jesus
[55:58] said here
[55:59] they were surrounded by sodom as we are
[56:03] and it vexed lot's
[56:05] righteous soul i believe it was peter
[56:08] that said it vexed lot's righteous soul
[56:11] daily but he stayed there
[56:15] it bothered him he struggled with it
[56:19] but he he just couldn't break free of it
[56:22] it's it's a perfect parallel brother
[56:24] let's go to ezekiel chapter nine
[56:28] we're surrounded by by these sins and it
[56:32] bothers us
[56:33] but it doesn't bother us enough
[56:36] it doesn't bother us enough to drive us
[56:39] to our knees
[56:40] unless it's one of our children
[56:43] unless it's one of our loved ones
[56:45] then it drives us to our knees but it
[56:47] should drive us to our knees
[56:50] with the sins that are throughout the
[56:51] world ezekiel chapter 9 it says this
[56:56] verse 3.
[56:58] and the glory
[57:01] of the god of israel was gone up from
[57:03] the cherub whereupon he was to the
[57:06] threshold of the house
[57:08] and he called to the man clothed with
[57:10] linen
[57:11] which had the writer's ink horn by his
[57:13] side
[57:14] and the lord said unto him
[57:16] grow go through the midst of the city
[57:20] through the midst of jerusalem
[57:22] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[57:24] men that sigh and cry
[57:27] for all the abominations that be done in
[57:30] the midst thereof
[57:32] all
[57:33] the abominations not just the ones
[57:36] from our loved ones
[57:38] and friends those are the only ones that
[57:40] were sealed
[57:42] those are the only ones
[57:44] that made it and jesus is saying here as
[57:47] it was in the days of lot
[57:49] so will it be
[57:51] at the second coming of christ let's
[57:53] continue on with with ezekiel here
[57:56] we all know that scripture but we might
[57:58] not know the rest of it
[58:01] verse 5
[58:02] and to the others he said
[58:04] in mine hearing this is ezekiel speaking
[58:07] go ye after him through the city
[58:10] and smite
[58:12] let not your eye spare neither have ye
[58:15] pity
[58:18] slay utterly old and young
[58:21] both maids and little children and women
[58:25] but come not near any man upon whom is
[58:28] the mark
[58:31] and begin at my sanctuary
[58:36] oh
[58:37] my
[58:40] then they began at the ancient men
[58:43] which were before the house
[58:46] what a sobering scripture
[58:50] those
[58:51] that had the seal of god
[58:53] that sighed and cried for these sins
[58:55] that are going on around us now
[58:58] they were sealed
[59:00] and those that
[59:02] weren't sighing and crying
[59:06] they were lost
[59:07] they were killed
[59:10] it scares me
[59:12] i think lord where am i
[59:14] where am i i try to put myself in the
[59:16] scripture where
[59:18] is daniel evans
[59:20] in this
[59:21] where are we
[59:23] for the life
[59:24] sister heather where are we
[59:26] place ourselves in the scripture
[59:32] verse 29 in chapter in luke
[59:39] you know i think about lot
[59:44] and lot wasn't even the right one even
[59:47] though it did vex his soul he was still
[59:50] not where he should have been
[59:52] i mean he he left sodom
[59:55] and then he went
[59:57] and
[59:57] and had two children with his two
[59:59] daughters
[1:00:01] and
[1:00:02] and and then the these they started this
[1:00:04] raid the race of the moabites and anime
[1:00:06] nights and there were problems
[1:00:08] throughout history
[1:00:10] that came from lot
[1:00:12] even lot wasn't right even though it
[1:00:14] bothered him
[1:00:16] now the sins of the world
[1:00:18] it bothers us
[1:00:20] but do we sigh and do we really cry
[1:00:23] for these things
[1:00:25] verse 29.
[1:00:28] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:00:30] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:00:32] heaven
[1:00:34] and destroyed them all
[1:00:36] even thus shall it be
[1:00:39] in the day when the son of man is
[1:00:41] revealed
[1:00:42] i always wondered as a young man
[1:00:46] i listened to brother braham's tapes
[1:00:49] and i always wondered
[1:00:50] why brother branham so often related
[1:00:54] this luke 17 30
[1:00:56] 17 28-30 why did he relate that to his
[1:01:00] ministry
[1:01:02] and and as a young man i couldn't make
[1:01:05] it fit
[1:01:07] i couldn't i could take the scriptures
[1:01:08] and i could read it and i was i was
[1:01:10] always like i don't understand that
[1:01:14] why why does that pertain to brother
[1:01:16] branham's ministry
[1:01:18] and remember
[1:01:20] what i said about a prophet speaking in
[1:01:22] present time
[1:01:25] it wasn't happening back then
[1:01:27] but now we see
[1:01:30] we see
[1:01:31] this situation
[1:01:33] that lot was in
[1:01:36] and now we all find ourselves right
[1:01:38] there
[1:01:39] i have a friend in jeffersonville
[1:01:41] his name's alex williams
[1:01:44] but alex was telling me he uh he opened
[1:01:47] up a chain of um asian food restaurants
[1:01:51] in um
[1:01:53] asheville i think it is asheville north
[1:01:55] carolina
[1:01:57] and
[1:01:58] he he was doing well
[1:02:00] and
[1:02:02] on his menu
[1:02:04] he had a lot of he had bible verses you
[1:02:06] know he had the jesus fish he wanted to
[1:02:08] make sure everybody knew
[1:02:11] that he was a christian
[1:02:13] and he made a stand well alex told me he
[1:02:15] said i got a call from the mayor
[1:02:18] and he said hey um
[1:02:21] i would suggest
[1:02:22] you take that stuff off of your menus
[1:02:26] and i'll say i'm not taking this off
[1:02:29] he says what are you talking about
[1:02:31] remember lot
[1:02:32] in the days of sodom
[1:02:35] he says we're getting we're getting
[1:02:37] complaints
[1:02:38] and he said the mayor said i would
[1:02:40] recommend that you take them take this
[1:02:42] stuff off
[1:02:43] alex
[1:02:44] you're going to be sorry
[1:02:46] alex said i'm not going to do it
[1:02:48] no
[1:02:51] then
[1:02:52] alex started getting reviews
[1:02:56] on yelp
[1:02:58] google
[1:02:59] and the different ones
[1:03:01] lies
[1:03:02] about his restaurant
[1:03:05] unsanitary conditions i found a roach in
[1:03:08] in my plate i found hair in my plate all
[1:03:10] of these things they were lies
[1:03:14] and you know who perpetrated it the
[1:03:15] homosexual lobby
[1:03:17] they got together and formed a boycott
[1:03:20] against brother alex and his in his
[1:03:22] restaurants put him out of business
[1:03:25] he had to leave it
[1:03:27] destroyed his business
[1:03:29] because he made a stand for christianity
[1:03:31] you make a stand for christianity
[1:03:34] there's a boycott
[1:03:35] the prophet prophesied about a boycott
[1:03:38] we see it right there
[1:03:40] in asheville north carolina and now and
[1:03:43] brother alex williams
[1:03:46] i was a
[1:03:48] daniel a couple years ago oh my this is
[1:03:51] my son by the way
[1:03:52] it's good to have him here
[1:03:54] proud of the boy
[1:03:56] daniel was um he was uh getting uh some
[1:04:00] some trying to get some classes together
[1:04:02] at pima community college honey i think
[1:04:04] it was daniel see daniel madeline trying
[1:04:06] to get some classes together at pima
[1:04:08] community college and um stephanie and
[1:04:11] daniel were were in the school and and i
[1:04:14] was waiting it was going to take like an
[1:04:15] hour
[1:04:17] for um for them to get finished so there
[1:04:19] was a pot a park
[1:04:21] by
[1:04:22] the west campus of
[1:04:24] pima i saw it there when we drove in so
[1:04:27] i i drove back out dropped them off and
[1:04:28] i drove
[1:04:30] and i started walking through this park
[1:04:33] and i'll tell you what it was a creepy
[1:04:37] feeling
[1:04:38] there was a bunch of men in the parking
[1:04:39] lot
[1:04:40] each one in their own vehicles probably
[1:04:42] 10 trucks 10 cars
[1:04:45] and i got out of my car and i thought
[1:04:48] this doesn't feel right
[1:04:50] and i said well i'm going to just go for
[1:04:52] a walk you know in the trail and i go
[1:04:55] walking
[1:04:56] and these men
[1:04:58] start following me
[1:05:00] and i'm like
[1:05:02] all right you know this is going to be
[1:05:03] fight or flight here pretty soon so so
[1:05:06] i'm walking along and i'm getting these
[1:05:09] these weird feelings and then they
[1:05:11] started coming out of the of the desert
[1:05:14] and i'm on the trail and i'm
[1:05:17] like
[1:05:18] i'm starting to freak out you know
[1:05:19] they're all by
[1:05:20] themselves you talk about a a horribly
[1:05:23] creepy feeling
[1:05:25] i know how lot felt
[1:05:27] and sodom so i'm walking along and and
[1:05:31] you know they're making
[1:05:32] they're they're making like gestures and
[1:05:36] and and i'm walking by and i gotta get
[1:05:38] out of here i got out
[1:05:41] got in the car took off
[1:05:43] get back to the parking lot and i
[1:05:44] started typing him okay what is going on
[1:05:46] here so i i searched this park and yes
[1:05:49] it was a pickup place
[1:05:52] for the those kind of people
[1:05:54] it was scary
[1:05:57] and you look at lot you look at lot in
[1:06:00] in this in this place
[1:06:02] and lot is
[1:06:05] he's
[1:06:06] he's uh
[1:06:08] intimidated
[1:06:09] by these people these men
[1:06:12] when they came to his door
[1:06:15] they had power that lot didn't have
[1:06:18] even though he was the mayor of the city
[1:06:20] he was afraid of them
[1:06:21] so they came in
[1:06:23] and lot
[1:06:24] they they threatened lot he was afraid
[1:06:27] of them and and you know the story so
[1:06:29] now we find ourselves in this day
[1:06:34] in that in this time as it was in the
[1:06:36] days of lot
[1:06:41] verse uh
[1:06:43] and friends i i look at i talk about
[1:06:45] this
[1:06:46] that's a sin
[1:06:48] and it's a sin
[1:06:50] that's not above any other sin
[1:06:52] you know it's a particularly kind of
[1:06:54] dirty sin
[1:06:55] but those
[1:06:56] those people can be children of god
[1:06:59] i'm not condemning those people
[1:07:02] that struggle with that believe me i
[1:07:03] promise you i'm not
[1:07:05] i pray for them
[1:07:06] it's a sin like any other sin but my
[1:07:09] point in saying this is it's a sign
[1:07:12] it's a sign of the last days
[1:07:15] it's not the unpardonable sin
[1:07:17] it's it shows us where we are at
[1:07:22] verse 31
[1:07:24] in that day
[1:07:25] he would shall be upon the housetop
[1:07:29] he he would shall be upon the housetop
[1:07:31] and his stuff in the house let him not
[1:07:33] come down to take it away and he that is
[1:07:36] in the field let him likewise not return
[1:07:38] back
[1:07:39] verse 32
[1:07:41] remember lot's wife
[1:07:44] and we know what what happened to lot's
[1:07:46] wife let me read you a quote what
[1:07:47] brother branham said jesus christ the
[1:07:49] same yesterday today and forever 6207
[1:07:53] 07 18 thank you my brother
[1:07:55] brother brown said this he said i
[1:07:57] believe that lot's wife
[1:07:59] as she was commanded by the angel not to
[1:08:02] look back
[1:08:03] and she turned and looked back and she
[1:08:06] stands today a pillar of salt
[1:08:09] because she just misbelieved god's word
[1:08:11] that much
[1:08:13] now she had better reason
[1:08:16] now she had a better reason than you and
[1:08:18] i have
[1:08:20] see her children and her grandchildren
[1:08:23] were burning up in the judgments of god
[1:08:26] and the screams of her own children and
[1:08:28] her grandchildren and the mother's heart
[1:08:30] crying out just disobeyed god's word
[1:08:32] enough to look over her shoulder and
[1:08:36] there she turned
[1:08:40] wow
[1:08:41] just that little bit
[1:08:45] she just
[1:08:46] looked back
[1:08:48] and
[1:08:49] put it put yourselves in that situation
[1:08:51] all of us
[1:08:53] i might have done i pray i wouldn't have
[1:08:55] but you can see how that that lady would
[1:08:57] do that
[1:08:58] i think of i think of nellie sanders
[1:09:01] and i know the story about nelly sanders
[1:09:03] how she she she gave her heart to the
[1:09:05] lord and she used to be a dancer and
[1:09:06] then and then she went by the dance hall
[1:09:09] and she just stopped for a moment
[1:09:12] and friends let me tell you there are
[1:09:13] pitfalls and there are traps everywhere
[1:09:16] for all of us
[1:09:17] you think because we have a little age
[1:09:20] on us
[1:09:21] that those traps aren't aren't there for
[1:09:23] us
[1:09:23] they're there for us
[1:09:25] right there for us brother
[1:09:27] every one of us satan wants each one of
[1:09:29] us
[1:09:30] not only does he want us he wants to
[1:09:32] hurt our influence
[1:09:33] also
[1:09:35] he's there for our children
[1:09:37] he's he's
[1:09:39] always after us
[1:09:42] and uh
[1:09:44] let's continue on
[1:09:46] where was i at verse
[1:09:51] verse 33
[1:09:53] whosoever shall seek to save his life
[1:09:56] shall lose it
[1:09:57] and whosoever shall lose his life shall
[1:10:00] preserve it remember what i said about
[1:10:02] preferring your brother
[1:10:04] seek the well-being being of the other
[1:10:06] person
[1:10:08] jesus continues on he says i'll tell i
[1:10:10] tell you
[1:10:12] in that night there shall be two men in
[1:10:14] one bed
[1:10:15] the one shall be taken and the other
[1:10:17] shall be left two women shall be grinded
[1:10:19] together the one shall be taken and the
[1:10:21] other left two men shall be in the field
[1:10:23] the one shall be taken and the other
[1:10:25] left now we know from brother branham's
[1:10:27] ministry that he's talking about
[1:10:29] there'll be two in the field here
[1:10:31] there'll be two in the bed here he's
[1:10:33] talking about there on different parts
[1:10:34] of the world
[1:10:35] there'll be two sleeping when the
[1:10:37] rapture happens over here they'll be out
[1:10:39] working and the rapture will happen
[1:10:41] it'll be a it'll be a rapture at the
[1:10:43] same time
[1:10:49] and they answered and said unto him
[1:10:51] where lord
[1:10:52] and he said unto them wheresoever the
[1:10:54] body is tither will the eagles be
[1:10:57] gathered together
[1:11:01] in other words where the carcass is
[1:11:03] where the slain lamb is
[1:11:06] where the word is
[1:11:08] that's where we will be gathered
[1:11:10] together and i say we because i'm part
[1:11:12] of it
[1:11:14] there's a movement friends there's a
[1:11:16] movement
[1:11:17] and it it started
[1:11:20] the the enemy is so good at what he does
[1:11:23] there's a movement to keep us out of
[1:11:26] church
[1:11:27] to keep us out of fellowship
[1:11:29] i thank god that we can tune in
[1:11:32] and and god bless you all that are
[1:11:34] streaming in
[1:11:36] but there's a movement
[1:11:38] to take the people out of church
[1:11:41] to prevent their fellowship and and we
[1:11:44] hear things like well you know i get fed
[1:11:47] i get fed at home
[1:11:49] you know or or well i i watch this
[1:11:51] brother on on youtube or that that
[1:11:53] brother and that's where i get fed or

[1:11:58] and we just listen to tapes we feed on
[1:12:00] the unadulterated word of god brother we
[1:12:02] just we love the prophet's message and
[1:12:04] we just stay home and listen to tapes
[1:12:06] i i i
[1:12:09] it's all about me
[1:12:11] it's all about how i can be fed
[1:12:16] but are we bringing our gift to church
[1:12:19] what about the other person
[1:12:21] what about what about coming to church
[1:12:25] and maybe a gift would operate in you
[1:12:28] sister your your your talent
[1:12:31] on the piano
[1:12:33] how could you share that talent with us
[1:12:36] if you're at home
[1:12:38] you can't
[1:12:39] but god bless you for being here so we
[1:12:41] can be blessed by it you know i see
[1:12:44] jeremy and angel i see you here every
[1:12:45] service god bless you for being here
[1:12:48] you come here and it's a it's a strength
[1:12:50] to us
[1:12:51] brother lyle isn't that wonderful to see
[1:12:53] these people as you're up here
[1:12:54] ministering it is such it's it's just as
[1:12:57] much of a blessing for me up here
[1:12:59] to feel that
[1:13:02] but
[1:13:03] you stay home
[1:13:06] you know maybe you're not hurting
[1:13:07] yourself but you're hurting me
[1:13:10] it hurts me
[1:13:11] it hurts sister surely
[1:13:13] it hurts my son it hurts it hurts the
[1:13:16] gear is here for everybody to stay home
[1:13:19] we need you
[1:13:21] how can the gifts operate if we want to
[1:13:24] see tongues and we want to see
[1:13:25] prophecies and we want to see healing
[1:13:27] how can it operate if we're at home
[1:13:30] it's impossible
[1:13:32] you see the devil's tactic he's sly
[1:13:35] he gets in there and he says what i'm
[1:13:37] going to do is i'm going to separate
[1:13:38] them
[1:13:39] and we're going to be thinking about
[1:13:40] it's just me
[1:13:42] i just i'm just going to you know i just
[1:13:44] i just feed on this and i just love this
[1:13:47] and and i like brother lyle but i don't
[1:13:49] like brother dan
[1:13:50] you know what
[1:13:52] just come
[1:13:53] you know
[1:13:54] i'll i'll wear you out
[1:13:59] i'll keep i'll keep pushing and i'll
[1:14:01] keep trying and finally i'll say
[1:14:02] something that'll be a blessing
[1:14:04] but
[1:14:05] but you come and you'll be a blessing to
[1:14:07] me
[1:14:09] because
[1:14:10] we want the gifts
[1:14:12] we want the gifts in church and they
[1:14:13] can't operate with a divided body
[1:14:17] let's continue on
[1:14:20] i um
[1:14:22] let's go to hebrews chapter 10 we'll
[1:14:25] move from luke
[1:14:26] and i still have a few minutes
[1:14:28] um
[1:14:29] i'm never going to finish by the way on
[1:14:31] this one so maybe i'll pick it up at
[1:14:33] another time but i'm just going to keep
[1:14:34] going until
[1:14:35] until they tell me to leave
[1:14:37] [Laughter]
[1:14:40] stay back there brother ed
[1:14:44] hebrews chapter 10
[1:14:46] verse 23
[1:14:52] let us hold fast the profession of our
[1:14:54] faith without wavering
[1:14:56] for he is faithful that promised
[1:14:59] and let us consider one another
[1:15:03] oh
[1:15:04] i'm getting there let us consider one
[1:15:07] another
[1:15:10] now the apostle here is a very important
[1:15:12] topic
[1:15:13] let us consider one another to provoke
[1:15:16] unto love
[1:15:17] and to good works
[1:15:21] verse 25
[1:15:23] no not forsaking the assembling of
[1:15:26] ourselves together
[1:15:29] as the manner
[1:15:30] of some is
[1:15:33] but exhorting one another
[1:15:36] and so much the more as ye see the day
[1:15:40] approaching
[1:15:41] and friends i i tried to lay a
[1:15:43] foundation for this tried to show the
[1:15:46] the hours that we're living in tried to
[1:15:48] show the violence that we're in
[1:15:49] according to luke 17 and according to
[1:15:52] the book of genesis with noah and and
[1:15:54] and to show the
[1:15:56] the um
[1:15:57] the immorality that's happening
[1:16:01] for this point right here
[1:16:04] and so much more as you see the day
[1:16:06] approaching
[1:16:08] we've got to stand strong together
[1:16:11] for if we sin willfully
[1:16:14] after that we have received the
[1:16:16] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:16:17] no more sacrifice for sin why would the
[1:16:20] apostle put that right after that
[1:16:22] sentence
[1:16:24] don't forsake assembling together but if
[1:16:26] we sin willfully
[1:16:28] whoa
[1:16:29] why would he say that right after that
[1:16:31] right after that
[1:16:37] we know
[1:16:39] we should be here
[1:16:42] and
[1:16:43] it's the ministry's job
[1:16:46] we need to make it a blessing to be here
[1:16:49] we need to do our best
[1:16:52] study as well as we can
[1:16:54] pray
[1:16:56] that we might be refreshing to the
[1:16:59] people so that the people want to come
[1:17:02] and then also
[1:17:03] the people have to come so that the
[1:17:06] other people are blessed
[1:17:08] remember the body of christ it's fitly
[1:17:12] joined together i gave the analogy one
[1:17:14] time of a puzzle
[1:17:16] and this puzzle this body of christ is
[1:17:19] put together and when when they're all
[1:17:21] piled up they all look the same
[1:17:24] but you start putting them together and
[1:17:26] it starts forming the image of of the
[1:17:29] the painting or the masterpiece whatever
[1:17:31] it is and each piece is placed in there
[1:17:35] and it is not complete
[1:17:39] until sister surely sitting right there
[1:17:42] it is not complete until every piece is
[1:17:45] placed and each one of us are a police
[1:17:48] piece and there's a bunch of pieces
[1:17:50] missing
[1:17:51] and i'm not just talking to the people
[1:17:53] streaming i'm saying the church body as
[1:17:56] a whole throughout the world
[1:17:59] each of those pieces have to take their
[1:18:02] place
[1:18:04] and i'm responsible for this piece right
[1:18:06] here
[1:18:07] and i want to make sure that i am right
[1:18:11] let's uh
[1:18:12] have time let's go to second timothy
[1:18:15] chapter 3.
[1:18:21] ii timothy 3
[1:18:23] this know also
[1:18:25] that in the last days perilous times
[1:18:27] shall come
[1:18:29] brother branham himself said that's
[1:18:30] today
[1:18:34] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:18:36] selves
[1:18:37] covetous boasters plow proud blasphemers
[1:18:40] disobedient to parents
[1:18:42] unthankful unholy
[1:18:45] friends this is a social media age
[1:18:48] what is social media about it's about
[1:18:51] promoting
[1:18:52] yourself it is i'm not against social
[1:18:55] media i i you know i don't partake in it
[1:18:58] but i'm not against social media but it
[1:19:01] is designed
[1:19:04] to glorify ourselves
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:07] it is and it's
[1:19:09] you look at right here lovers of their
[1:19:11] own selves
[1:19:13] can you imagine
[1:19:15] putting a pic when we were kids putting
[1:19:16] a picture of myself up in my room or
[1:19:19] something
[1:19:20] and and now i mean it's we have these
[1:19:23] pages it's all pictures about us
[1:19:26] and it's like you know you see pictures
[1:19:28] like they don't look like that i know
[1:19:30] that person they know that's the best
[1:19:31] picture they ever took it's all
[1:19:33] photoshopped and you know and you know
[1:19:35] thin where it should be thinned and you
[1:19:36] know and everything it's like
[1:19:39] it's not even real
[1:19:41] and now and then we see these so-called
[1:19:43] influencers
[1:19:45] and these influencers they
[1:19:48] they make it to where everybody should
[1:19:50] look the same
[1:19:52] they all have the big
[1:19:53] eyelashes and the paint and the and they
[1:19:56] all look the same
[1:19:58] and and it's like
[1:20:00] what they look like you have these women
[1:20:03] we saw on that same news program i
[1:20:05] shouldn't watch i mean i watched the
[1:20:06] news like whoa it really messed me up i
[1:20:09] mean
[1:20:10] i think it scarred me watching that bit
[1:20:12] of news last night but both me and
[1:20:13] stephanie and merrily are watching and
[1:20:16] they had this this woman on there
[1:20:18] that um she was a normal fox newscaster
[1:20:21] and she had some kind of work done and
[1:20:23] her face was squeezed back
[1:20:26] and
[1:20:27] it's like oh you look like all the other
[1:20:29] ones and they look like a catfish
[1:20:32] their face is squeezed back their lips
[1:20:33] are all sticking out it's like
[1:20:36] you look like everybody else
[1:20:39] they want uniformity
[1:20:42] and we're different we're all different
[1:20:44] pieces
[1:20:45] all of us are different
[1:20:48] but the world wants us to conform to
[1:20:50] their way
[1:20:52] i'm not watching the news anymore
[1:20:58] without natural affections that's an
[1:21:00] intimate
[1:21:02] word
[1:21:03] without natural affections
[1:21:06] truth-bakers false accusers
[1:21:09] incontinent
[1:21:10] word incontinent they can't control
[1:21:12] themselves
[1:21:13] they fly off at every little thing any
[1:21:15] little bit of criticism they fight back
[1:21:18] they have bad tempers
[1:21:21] fierce
[1:21:22] despisers of those that are good
[1:21:23] traitors heady high minded lovers of
[1:21:25] pleasure more than lovers of god having
[1:21:27] a form of godliness
[1:21:30] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:21:33] turn away
[1:21:34] they may go to church
[1:21:37] they may study their bibles
[1:21:40] they may listen to tapes
[1:21:43] they uh
[1:21:45] but there's always an excuse
[1:21:47] why the power of god isn't present
[1:21:50] there's always an excuse why we don't
[1:21:52] see the gifts in the church
[1:21:54] there's always an excuse why we don't
[1:21:56] see the healings that we should oh
[1:21:57] someone so got healed one time
[1:22:00] there's always an excuse
[1:22:02] why
[1:22:04] that that we don't see these things i
[1:22:05] remember i think it was gideon
[1:22:07] that said if god be with us then where
[1:22:10] are all the miracles
[1:22:12] amen and i say the same thing if god is
[1:22:14] with us i'm not talking about the tucson
[1:22:16] tabernacle
[1:22:18] i'm talking about christianity in
[1:22:19] general i'm talking about the message in
[1:22:21] general
[1:22:23] if god is with us
[1:22:25] then where are these miracles that we
[1:22:26] saw in the 1950s
[1:22:28] they should be with us
[1:22:31] god is a supernatural god
[1:22:35] for this for of this sort are they which
[1:22:38] creep into houses and leave captive
[1:22:39] silly women laden with sins and led away
[1:22:42] with diverse lusts
[1:22:44] that word lust doesn't necessarily mean
[1:22:46] like the lust that we think about is
[1:22:48] just different passions different
[1:22:50] desires ever learning
[1:22:53] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:22:55] of the truth
[1:22:57] they're constantly studying the word
[1:22:59] looking at it but they're looking at it
[1:23:02] through denominational eyes
[1:23:05] they're looking at it with their own way
[1:23:07] of thinking i preached that message on
[1:23:09] images
[1:23:10] they're looking at it through their own
[1:23:12] glasses and all they are seeing is what
[1:23:16] agrees with their doctrines
[1:23:19] it has to agree with my doctrine or it's
[1:23:22] out and then they ignore
[1:23:24] the rest of it
[1:23:26] and that's that's what we're seeing here
[1:23:29] and uh let's let's go over to verse
[1:23:31] let's go over to chapter four
[1:23:34] in second timothy
[1:23:37] i charge thee therefore before god
[1:23:40] and the lord jesus christ who shall
[1:23:42] judge the quick and the dead at his
[1:23:44] appearing
[1:23:45] and his kingdom
[1:23:46] preach the word
[1:23:48] be instant in season out of season
[1:23:51] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:23:54] long-suffering and doctrine
[1:23:56] for the time will come
[1:23:59] when they will not endure sound doctrine
[1:24:02] but after their own lusts
[1:24:04] shall they heap to themselves teachers
[1:24:07] having itching ears
[1:24:10] now friends that scripture is very
[1:24:12] important
[1:24:14] for a church that scripture is very
[1:24:16] important we see these mega churches out
[1:24:18] there
[1:24:19] and it's like just love one another
[1:24:22] and friends if we just love one another
[1:24:25] and we just are good people and and you
[1:24:28] make your offering if you just make an
[1:24:30] offering for a thousand dollars then
[1:24:32] brother then then god would just pour
[1:24:34] out his blessings nonsense
[1:24:39] it is not about that so the people go
[1:24:41] it's like oh i just pay a little bit i
[1:24:42] can do that that's the kind of preacher
[1:24:44] i want to hear i don't want to hear any
[1:24:45] correction
[1:24:47] so then they go and they they get these
[1:24:49] preachers that are just going to say
[1:24:51] what's according to their doctrines
[1:24:54] not bring any correction
[1:24:56] not bring any changes
[1:24:58] not not preach that there's something
[1:25:00] wrong if we're not having miracles
[1:25:02] not say that
[1:25:04] not say where are the gifts where are
[1:25:05] the tongues not say not say where is the
[1:25:08] healing not say where is the prophecy
[1:25:10] but oh you're good because you have the
[1:25:12] word
[1:25:13] oh that's what i want to hear
[1:25:15] and it's the congregation it's the
[1:25:16] people that are drawing this out
[1:25:20] and then they that
[1:25:22] these teachers
[1:25:24] these these people are hearing what they
[1:25:26] want to hear
[1:25:28] and they're drawing that out of these
[1:25:31] men
[1:25:33] and that's what this scripture is
[1:25:34] talking about here
[1:25:39] for the time will come
[1:25:42] when they will not endure sound doctrine
[1:25:44] but after their own lusts shall heap to
[1:25:46] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:25:50] and they shall turn away their hearts
[1:25:51] from the truth
[1:25:53] and it shall be turned unto fables
[1:25:56] it runs many of the things that we hear
[1:25:58] just are simply not true
[1:26:01] everything
[1:26:03] should be checked with this word
[1:26:05] and not just reading this word but the
[1:26:08] holy spirit inside of you will quicken
[1:26:10] this word
[1:26:11] amen
[1:26:15] because you see
[1:26:17] that they twist
[1:26:18] this word will be twisted and this
[1:26:20] laodicean age this lukewarm age
[1:26:24] where people are into their own thing
[1:26:26] it's all about me
[1:26:28] don't want to make an effort
[1:26:31] that's
[1:26:32] when we have to look into this book and
[1:26:35] we're all pulled by it
[1:26:37] all of us there's many times we don't
[1:26:39] want to do it
[1:26:40] but we have to take a step and we have
[1:26:42] to do it and don't be part of this
[1:26:44] laodicean
[1:26:46] lazy spirit
[1:26:48] and they shall turn i'm going to read it
[1:26:50] again and they shall turn away their
[1:26:52] ears from the truth
[1:26:53] and shall be turned unto fables
[1:26:57] ii timothy chapter 4
[1:27:00] brother branham
[1:27:03] was led
[1:27:05] in 1933
[1:27:07] when he built the branham tabernacle
[1:27:11] wrote that scripture
[1:27:13] on a piece of paper
[1:27:15] and dropped it in the cornerstone of the
[1:27:17] branham tabernacle
[1:27:20] that's how much that scripture pertains
[1:27:24] to today
[1:27:25] we need to always be watchful
[1:27:29] always be into the word
[1:27:35] like i said
[1:27:37] i'm never
[1:27:39] going
[1:27:41] to finish it's uh
[1:27:44] sister sisters if you come
[1:27:48] brother aaron i'm going to ask you to
[1:27:49] close here in a moment
[1:27:52] revelation chapter 19.
[1:27:54] you know when when you read your bible
[1:27:56] when you really study it there's these
[1:27:58] books called the prophets amos malachi
[1:28:02] and and and in all of these books
[1:28:05] they really hammer
[1:28:07] the people
[1:28:08] but then almost always god comes comes
[1:28:10] out at the end and he gives you some
[1:28:12] encouragement you know it's it's the
[1:28:14] book of jonah it's like boom boom boom
[1:28:16] and then oh
[1:28:18] here but it's going to be okay
[1:28:20] and that's usually god's theme he he
[1:28:22] brings a prophet that prophet brings
[1:28:24] correction but then there's hope there's
[1:28:28] hope associated with his message and he
[1:28:30] always gives us hope
[1:28:33] revelation chapter 19
[1:28:35] verse 5.
[1:28:40] and a voice came out of the throne
[1:28:42] saying praise our god
[1:28:45] all ye his servants
[1:28:48] and ye that fear him both small and
[1:28:50] great
[1:28:53] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[1:28:55] great multitude
[1:28:56] and as the voice of many waters
[1:28:59] and as the voice of mighty thunderings
[1:29:01] saying alleluia for the lord god
[1:29:04] omnipotent reigneth
[1:29:06] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:29:09] and give honor to him
[1:29:11] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:29:13] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:29:16] we're doing it now
[1:29:20] and to her was granted that she should
[1:29:22] be arrayed in fine linen
[1:29:25] clean and white
[1:29:28] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:29:30] of the saints
[1:29:32] and he sayeth unto me right
[1:29:34] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:29:37] the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:29:39] and he saith unto me these are the true
[1:29:42] sayings of god
[1:29:43] and i fell down at his feet to worship
[1:29:45] him
[1:29:46] and he said unto me
[1:29:48] see that thou do it not
[1:29:51] i am thy fellow servant
[1:29:53] and of thy brethren that have the
[1:29:55] testimony of jesus
[1:29:58] worship
[1:29:59] god
[1:30:01] for the testimony of jesus
[1:30:04] is the spirit of prophecy
[1:30:08] amen
[1:30:09] and uh
[1:30:11] i'll close with one more scripture in
[1:30:13] mark chapter 13.
[1:30:17] and i'll start with verse 35 brother
[1:30:19] jordan now let's start with verse 33
[1:30:26] mark chapter 13
[1:30:29] verse 33 take ye heed watch and
[1:30:32] pray for ye know not
[1:30:35] when the time is
[1:30:37] for the son of man
[1:30:39] is a is as a man taking a far journey
[1:30:42] who left his house
[1:30:44] and gave authority to his servants
[1:30:46] and to every man his work
[1:30:48] and commanded the porter to watch
[1:30:51] watch ye therefore
[1:30:53] for ye know not when the master of the
[1:30:55] house cometh at even
[1:30:58] at midnight
[1:30:59] at the crowing or in the morning
[1:31:02] unless coming suddenly
[1:31:04] he finds you sleeping
[1:31:07] and what i say unto you i say and all
[1:31:11] watch
[1:31:14] friends we have seen the signs
[1:31:17] the times
[1:31:19] i hope that i have a lot there's there's
[1:31:21] a lot more
[1:31:23] on there let's stand there's there's a
[1:31:25] lot more there
[1:31:27] that we could talk about
[1:31:29] that we could fellowship about
[1:31:31] knowing that these signs that have come
[1:31:33] before us
[1:31:36] but as the lord jesus instructed
[1:31:39] let's watch
[1:31:41] watch these things happen and when i
[1:31:43] talk about these sins i'm not talking
[1:31:45] about the sinner
[1:31:47] these sins are signs
[1:31:49] maybe at another time
[1:31:50] we could talk about the sins and and and
[1:31:53] how that we should stay away from those
[1:31:54] but but i'm talking about these sins or
[1:31:57] signs now
[1:31:59] we have to be careful
[1:32:00] and we have to pray
[1:32:02] don't miss church
[1:32:04] we need to be here
[1:32:06] not for ourselves
[1:32:09] but for the ones sitting next to us
[1:32:12] and then we'll see this puzzle come
[1:32:14] together
[1:32:15] and we'll see
[1:32:17] the gifts start to operate
[1:32:20] we'll see the love
[1:32:21] flowing
[1:32:23] and we'll see
[1:32:25] the coming
[1:32:26] of our lord jesus

[1:38:07] a little bit after work and sat down and
[1:38:09] that scripture says know ye not ye are
[1:38:12] the temple of the holy ghost
[1:38:15] i just began to think of that for a
[1:38:16] little while this afternoon being the
[1:38:19] temple of the holy ghost
[1:38:20] clean pure sanctified
[1:38:23] for the presence of god for himself to
[1:38:25] dwell in us
[1:38:28] and then we would take them to places
[1:38:30] where we would shouldn't be
[1:38:31] listen to things we shouldn't be hearing
[1:38:35] when you have to say lord
[1:38:37] let me let me respect you reverence you
[1:38:40] so that you could be manifested in us
[1:38:44] and then others would say
[1:38:45] there's something that i need
[1:38:48] that's what i desire
[1:38:50] let's just pray lord
[1:38:54] it's a serious time we're living in it's

[1:39:16] those
[1:39:19] lord who are still struggling still
[1:39:20] going maybe
[1:39:22] maybe have turned their back on and just
[1:39:23] doesn't seem to work for them lord our
[1:39:25] heart still reaches out to them
[1:39:28] when you see these things happening lord
[1:39:32] just as you looked over israel you
[1:39:33] looked at jerusalem and you said oh
[1:39:35] jerusalem and you listen how oft
[1:39:38] would i have drawn you under my knees
[1:39:40] but you would not lord it's the same
[1:39:42] spirit in us lord hearing brother daniel

[1:39:56] somebody lord

[1:40:06] lord this water this that you place on
[1:40:08] it's not for ourselves it's to give out

[1:41:32] they
[1:41:33] will never pass away
[1:41:39] hold to god's unchanging hands
[1:41:46] hold to god's unchanging hand
[1:41:53] build your hopes on things eternal
[1:42:00] hold to god the first verse
[1:42:07] time is filled with swift transition
[1:42:14] not
[1:42:15] of earth and move can stand
[1:42:21] build your hopes on things
[1:42:26] eternal hold to god's unchanging hand

[1:43:01] i say this to you mom and dads
[1:43:07] sometimes it's hard
[1:43:09] sometimes it hurts
[1:43:11] sometimes you kind of want to just say
[1:43:13] oh it's okay
[1:43:16] but then the fruit of that comes back
[1:43:18] you say why did i do that
[1:43:22] stay true
[1:43:23] hold firm
[1:43:25] stand on the truth
[1:43:27] and that that
[1:43:29] that would you put will bring back that
[1:43:31] which you you put out
[1:43:34] i was driving home with one of my
[1:43:36] daughters one evening we were headed
[1:43:38] home and i
[1:43:40] i asked her tell me something that you
[1:43:42] appreciate about mom and dad
[1:43:46] and then she just said the fact that you
[1:43:48] and mom stand together and agree
[1:43:50] together
[1:43:53] you're consistent
[1:43:54] if i go to mom
[1:43:56] i won't get a different answer than i
[1:43:58] get from you
[1:44:00] you'll stand together
[1:44:03] and
[1:44:04] it pays off
[1:44:06] it pays off
[1:44:08] because
[1:44:10] your children will come back to you and
[1:44:11] say help
[1:44:13] i had a neighbor i've shared this at a
[1:44:15] neighbor
[1:44:16] when we were kids
[1:44:18] and they had a tv at home and i wanted
[1:44:20] to go to their house to watch cartoons
[1:44:23] but they always wanted to be at our
[1:44:24] house
[1:44:26] and one day we went to their house lived
[1:44:28] up the street
[1:44:30] and we were there watching cartoons and
[1:44:32] in about 10 15 minutes his little
[1:44:35] brother comes running out the room and
[1:44:36] says mom and dad are out again at it
[1:44:38] again let's start let's get out of here
[1:44:41] and then you heard the banging dad was
[1:44:43] hitting mom with a frying pan they were
[1:44:45] going at each other
[1:44:46] and we ran down we ran back to my house
[1:44:48] and my friend said
[1:44:50] that's why i'd rather be at your house
[1:44:52] that doesn't happen here
[1:44:56] we probably took it for granted
[1:44:59] but hold to god's unchanging mom and dad
[1:45:02] stand firm
[1:45:03] stand firm
[1:45:05] i still my father and mother i can go to
[1:45:07] them and i know they're christians they
[1:45:09] have never changed for that they always
