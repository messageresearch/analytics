[10:32] amen every day with Jesus just been
[10:35] thinking a lot about day and daily
[10:39] given the testimony the other night
[10:40] about every service and then just
[10:42] thinking about every day we want to be
[10:45] closer to the Lord and just seeking him
[10:47] and as I started thinking about it more
[10:50] and more and Psalm 68 19.
[10:54] brother Peter or Brother Joseph
[10:56] whoever's there
[10:58] says blessed be the Lord who daily
[11:00] loadeth us with benefits even the god of
[11:02] our Salvation Selah and I thought
[11:06] well he's given us and seeking us and
[11:09] doing all these things for us every day
[11:11] we don't need to we don't we we kind of
[11:14] sit there and maybe think oh I have you
[11:16] know I don't want to say we but
[11:17] sometimes some of us maybe get to
[11:19] thinking in our mind that oh I got got
[11:21] to do this for God today but he's every
[11:24] day seeking us and every day doing
[11:26] things for us we don't you know and it
[11:28] just gives you a joy when you start
[11:30] realizing how much the Lord's doing for
[11:32] us every day you know and it shouldn't
[11:34] be something where we just have to work
[11:36] it up or try to do it but it just is
[11:38] there because the Lord Is With Us amen I
[11:42] was searching the songs in the database
[11:44] back there before service and I typed in

[34:13] Matt Watkins
[34:15] brought us a powerful message
[34:17] about the anointing of the supernatural
[34:21] Sunday evening at Shalom Tabernacle
[34:23] brother Paul Dirksen brought a striking
[34:25] message
[34:26] about the atonement
[34:29] I want to share with you tonight what I
[34:31] believe the Lord's placed on my heart
[34:33] for this evening some of it will be a
[34:36] bit of a follow-up from Sunday but
[34:38] before we do that
[34:40] let's petition our heavenly father one
[34:42] more time
[34:43] ask his Blessing oversight and guidance
[34:47] Lord Jesus it is such a privilege to be
[34:50] here
[34:51] to be here amongst your people purchased
[34:55] by your blood
[34:56] Lord Jesus that you loved each one of us
[34:59] individually so much that you would go
[35:01] through that sacrifice Lord how we love
[35:04] you how we should respond to that Lord I
[35:07] pray that you'd help me tonight Lord to
[35:09] just not be here as Lyle Johnson but
[35:13] Lord to be able to step aside and
[35:15] somehow yield to you that you could
[35:17] speak words of encouragement words
[35:20] whatever they happen to be that are
[35:22] needed by whoever happens to be hearing
[35:24] them wherever I might misspeak Lord may
[35:26] you translate into the ears of the
[35:29] hearers Lord for those that are not able
[35:31] to be here but are are streaming the
[35:34] service or dialing in Lord I pray that
[35:36] your presence would be with them and
[35:38] Lord draw us closer to yourself help
[35:40] prepare us Lord for that great day that
[35:43] we believe will soon be upon us when
[35:45] we'll be caught up together to be with
[35:47] you forever we thank you Lord Jesus we
[35:50] thank you again for this blessed
[35:52] opportunity in Jesus precious name we
[35:55] pray amen
[35:59] while we're still standing in honor of
[36:02] his word we'll we'll be reading
[36:04] from second Kings chapter two it's part
[36:08] of the text that brother Watkins used
[36:10] Sunday morning
[36:11] but for context
[36:14] the setting
[36:16] is the time that Elijah was taken up in
[36:18] Elisha received the spirit that had
[36:21] animated Elijah into what he called a
[36:23] double portion
[36:25] the two of them were walking together
[36:28] quite some distance and the map on the
[36:30] screen you see Jerusalem in the lower
[36:33] left it's circled in blue just as a
[36:35] point of reference Bethel
[36:37] is in the upper left
[36:40] this is where Jacob had built an altar
[36:42] many centuries earlier
[36:44] were jeroboam had built a shrine with
[36:47] the golden calf after the breakup of the
[36:50] United Kingdom
[36:51] into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah
[36:55] as they walked through Bethel Elijah
[36:57] told Elisha stay here
[36:59] but Elisha said no
[37:03] well they continued on to Jericho they
[37:05] they went down this this path here
[37:07] approximately that's about 14 miles
[37:11] at Bethel the elevation is a couple
[37:12] thousand feet Jericho is about 1200 feet
[37:14] below sea level so they had about a 3
[37:17] 000 foot elevation change and they're
[37:19] walking along
[37:23] again
[37:24] as they got to Jericho Elijah turned to
[37:27] Elisha and said you you wait here
[37:31] and Elisha said no he refused to be
[37:35] dissuaded
[37:36] from staying with the prophet well they
[37:39] continued their journey together
[37:40] another few miles to the Jordan River
[37:45] it's a rightmost location marked on the
[37:47] map Elijah removed his cloak or his coat
[37:50] or outer garment the King James version
[37:52] says his mantle
[37:54] and struck the surface of the river with
[37:56] it
[37:58] the waters parted
[38:00] and the two of them crossed on dry
[38:03] ground
[38:04] now this is near or at the very place
[38:07] that Joshua had crossed into Canaan
[38:10] almost 600 years prior
[38:12] when the priests bore the Ark of the
[38:14] Covenant and the waters parted at the
[38:17] time of the spring flood for the entire
[38:19] assembly the entire Congregation of
[38:22] Israel to cross
[38:23] it's also the same place where Jesus
[38:26] would be baptized some 900 years later
[38:30] by John another one with the spirit of
[38:32] Elijah well let's join them now second
[38:35] Kings 2 verse 9.
[38:38] we mean it came to pass when they Elijah
[38:42] and Elisha were gone over the the parted
[38:46] Waters of the Jordan which closed behind
[38:48] them after they crossed over that Elijah
[38:51] finally said to Elisha ask what I shall
[38:55] do for thee before I be taken away from
[38:57] thee up until now it's been mostly stay
[39:00] here I'm gonna go on stay here but now
[39:02] it's okay what do you want
[39:04] Elisha said I pray thee let a double
[39:08] portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[39:13] and
[39:14] Elijah said to Elisha you've asked a
[39:19] hard thing
[39:20] nevertheless if you see me when I'm
[39:23] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[39:25] but if not
[39:27] it shall not be so
[39:30] and it came to pass as they still went
[39:33] on and talked I I wonder what they were
[39:36] talking about I wonder what their
[39:38] conversation was
[39:40] well as they communed behold there
[39:43] appeared a chariot of Fire
[39:46] and Horses of Fire
[39:48] and parted them both asunder
[39:51] and Elijah went up
[39:53] not by the fiery chariot but by a
[39:56] whirlwind
[39:58] into heaven
[40:00] and Elisha saw it and he cried my father
[40:04] my father The Chariot of Israel the
[40:06] horsemen thereof
[40:09] and Elisha
[40:10] saw Elijah
[40:12] no more
[40:14] and Elisha took hold of his own clothes
[40:17] and rent them in two pieces
[40:20] a sign of anguish
[40:22] grief
[40:24] morning
[40:27] please be seated
[40:31] Elisha had requested a double portion
[40:35] of the spirit
[40:37] that was on Elijah
[40:40] what does a double portion mean
[40:44] the Bible records twice as many miracles
[40:46] for Elisha as for Elijah is that what a
[40:51] double portion means is this a
[40:52] mathematical construct of some sort
[40:55] or or is this perhaps some kind of an of
[40:58] an idiomatic expression an indirect way
[41:01] of saying that Elisha knowing that
[41:04] Elijah was soon to be gone and
[41:07] realizing that Israel needed that
[41:09] prophetic Ministry to continue
[41:12] desired to be Elijah's successor with
[41:14] the same Spirit upon him
[41:16] not to be a Moses he didn't want a
[41:19] double portion of Moses spirit not to be
[41:22] a Samuel whose Ministries were for a
[41:24] different time
[41:26] but to be a continuation
[41:28] of Elijah's Ministry the anointing or
[41:31] Spirit appropriate for that moment in
[41:33] history
[41:36] how does one have twice as much of the
[41:39] spirit of God as another person
[41:42] how does one measure such things
[41:45] I'm sure God knows he knows how to
[41:47] measure he knows how to allocate
[41:50] I don't
[41:52] well the topic Sunday morning
[41:56] was the supernatural anointing I believe
[41:59] is what the brother called it but but
[42:01] what does that mean
[42:04] well in the Old Testament the word
[42:07] anoint or anointing is typically used to
[42:10] describe an oil often combined with
[42:12] other aromatic ingredients a common
[42:15] context is that it's poured on or
[42:17] applied
[42:19] to a person being installed in a high
[42:21] office
[42:22] perhaps a priest or a high priest
[42:25] perhaps a king
[42:27] the word is first mentioned
[42:29] in the book of Exodus and last mentioned
[42:32] and the writings of Isaiah
[42:35] in the New Testament the Greek words
[42:38] translated as anoint or anointing are
[42:40] usually ones that again mean an ointment
[42:42] or an oil or applying it like anointing
[42:45] the sick with oil or when the woman
[42:47] poured the expensive ointment on Jesus
[42:50] feet
[42:51] we know that in the Bible
[42:54] oil is a representation it's a symbol
[42:57] of the Holy Spirit
[43:00] well and and this and some of the
[43:03] scriptures we'll be reading this evening
[43:04] you might want to pay attention
[43:07] to the use of the terms thee or thy or
[43:10] ye and you recall and King James English
[43:14] this this second person pronoun if it
[43:17] starts with the th thee thy thou it's
[43:20] it's a singular it's addressed to one
[43:23] person or one nation or one entity but
[43:26] if it begins with a Y like ye or you
[43:28] then it's a plural it's it's there might
[43:31] be the congregation but the plural is
[43:34] the Believers within that congregation
[43:38] don't get too hung up on that but I'd
[43:41] like to read to you from from first John
[43:44] chapter 2.
[43:49] it says the anointing
[43:51] which you have received from him abideth
[43:54] lives in you
[43:56] you need not that any man teach you
[43:59] but as the same anointing teaches you of
[44:01] all things and is truth
[44:04] and is no lie and even as it hath taught
[44:07] you you shall abide live
[44:10] in him
[44:12] the the Greek word used in this passage
[44:15] of scripture is chrisma it literally
[44:18] means an unquote it's translated as
[44:20] anointing but in this context it means
[44:23] the Holy Spirit
[44:25] so we can read this verse from the
[44:28] Apostle John as but the Holy Spirit
[44:30] which you have received of him lives in
[44:33] you you need not that any man teach you
[44:36] but is the same Holy Spirit teaches you
[44:38] all things and is truth
[44:42] and there's no lie even it has taught
[44:45] you
[44:46] you shall live in him
[44:48] so John's writing to a group that he
[44:50] calls his little children
[44:53] and note John's using the plural so he's
[44:56] addressing
[44:58] each person within this group so the
[45:01] obvious conclusion I suppose is it for a
[45:04] church
[45:05] for a group for a church to be
[45:08] Spirit-filled
[45:10] we need to each be individually
[45:13] filled with the Holy Spirit
[45:17] the undercurrent
[45:19] is we need each other
[45:23] just like the emperor penguins need each
[45:25] other to survive the cold dark winter
[45:29] they huddle in close Fellowship
[45:32] together there's not a lot of social
[45:33] distancing in that picture
[45:36] they do this to survive
[45:38] and they rotate in that huddle
[45:41] so each carries a portion of the load
[45:46] bearing one another's burdens and so
[45:48] fulfilling the law of Christ comes to
[45:50] mind
[45:51] now if one of those Penguins leaves the
[45:54] group
[45:55] it'll perish
[45:57] the group
[45:58] the weakened
[46:00] will still survive
[46:04] at the end of his ministry
[46:06] Jesus told his disciples that the Holy
[46:09] Spirit which he would send from the
[46:11] father
[46:12] is the spirit of
[46:14] truth
[46:16] it confirms that we just read in first
[46:18] John that the the Charisma that lives in
[46:20] them and teaches them is truth
[46:24] therefore it's the Holy Spirit
[46:27] John 16 13 how be it when he
[46:30] the spirit of
[46:32] truth
[46:34] is come he will guide you into all truth
[46:38] he shall not speak of himself but
[46:39] whatsoever ye shall hear that shall he
[46:42] speak and he will show you things to
[46:44] come
[46:45] it's the same thing teaching by that
[46:48] Holy Spirit of Truth so just simplify
[46:50] when we speak of a supernatural
[46:53] anointing
[46:54] the anointing of the supernatural
[46:57] we're speaking of the Holy Spirit
[47:01] the Holy Spirit living in and working
[47:03] through us
[47:04] individually
[47:06] and as a body
[47:08] I want to be part of that
[47:10] don't you
[47:13] well moving on
[47:15] a few weeks ago I spoke on Ephesians
[47:18] possessing the promises we discussed
[47:21] that Paul wrote about a revelation that
[47:24] he received from the Lord
[47:26] in chapter 3 having expounded on Unity
[47:30] faith and Reconciliation let's read
[47:33] Ephesians 3 starting at verse 1.
[47:38] Paul's after expounding on these things
[47:40] says for this cause I Paul the prisoner
[47:44] of the Roman government
[47:46] wait it doesn't say that that was the
[47:48] outward appearance
[47:50] but in reality
[47:52] before his arrest
[47:54] before his deportation to Rome
[47:57] he was already the prisoner of Jesus
[48:01] Christ
[48:02] for you gentiles
[48:05] again he's writing to a gentile Church
[48:08] people who would until recently been
[48:11] pagans
[48:12] and all that that implies
[48:15] he goes on if ye have heard of the
[48:17] dispensation of the grace of God
[48:20] which has given me to you word for your
[48:23] benefit
[48:25] how that by Revelation he made known
[48:28] unto me the mystery as I wrote before in
[48:32] few words whereby when you read you may
[48:34] understand my knowledge and the mystery
[48:36] of Christ he goes on this mystery
[48:40] which in other Ages was not made known
[48:43] Unto the Sons of man
[48:45] it's now revealed
[48:48] unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets
[48:51] by the spirit
[48:53] and this is the revelation of that
[48:55] mystery that the Gentiles
[48:58] should be fellow heirs
[49:01] joint heirs with Israel
[49:05] and of the same
[49:07] not a different or separate but the same
[49:10] body
[49:12] singular one body not two not many
[49:16] one
[49:18] and partakers of sharing in his promise
[49:21] in Christ
[49:23] by the gospel
[49:25] the
[49:26] not just the good news but for these
[49:28] guys for us it's really good news
[49:31] well
[49:33] I imagine this this was a little hard
[49:36] for the Gentiles and Ephesus to
[49:38] understand
[49:39] much less to appreciate
[49:44] okay
[49:45] we're allowed to derive all the benefits
[49:48] of Judaism
[49:51] but without all the rules
[49:53] wonderful
[49:56] there's a problem
[49:58] and the problem is that the practice of
[50:01] the Jewish religion in Paul's day was
[50:04] adherence to a set of rules
[50:07] the law given by God himself on Mount
[50:09] Sinai through Moses to the people if you
[50:12] obey this I'll do that
[50:15] if you don't
[50:16] look out
[50:19] look at this
[50:21] not just from the
[50:23] perspective of the Gentiles or their
[50:25] Church of Ephesus but what about the
[50:27] perspective
[50:28] of the Jewish people
[50:31] the chosen of God
[50:33] are now to relinquish or or maybe more
[50:36] accurately to share
[50:38] there are privileged position as the
[50:41] chosen
[50:43] which by the way they received by grace
[50:46] and which they attempt to maintain by
[50:50] careful observance of all the rules
[50:54] as they've been commanded by God to keep
[50:57] and now this position of being the
[51:00] chosen
[51:01] is suddenly going to include all sorts
[51:04] of rabble
[51:06] from their perspective
[51:08] also by grace who by the way neither
[51:11] know
[51:12] nor have to keep all those rules
[51:16] let's recall
[51:18] how the Jewish Nation
[51:20] came to the place
[51:22] of being the chosen
[51:25] God is addressing the congregation
[51:28] through Moses Deuteronomy 7.
[51:31] verse 6 we read
[51:33] for thou
[51:34] singular the nation Thou Art and holy
[51:39] set aside a sanctified people unto the
[51:43] Lord thy God
[51:45] the Lord thy God hath chosen thee
[51:48] that's that's choosing the nation as a
[51:51] unit
[51:52] and the nation didn't choose him
[51:55] there was no election campaign no
[51:57] counting of ballots no ranked Choice
[51:59] voting no waiting for the results
[52:03] the nation
[52:05] yes special
[52:07] unto himself
[52:09] above this isn't above as an over or
[52:13] ruling but above as in selected or apart
[52:18] from all people
[52:20] that are on the face of the Earth
[52:24] watch out for bride Pride Israel
[52:27] the Lord did not set his love upon you
[52:30] now the plural form speaking to each
[52:33] member of that Nation
[52:35] nor choose you because you were more in
[52:39] number than any other people you are the
[52:41] fewest of all people compared to the
[52:43] planet's population you represented an
[52:46] insignificant percentage a drop in the
[52:48] bucket
[52:51] but
[52:53] here's why you're chosen first because
[52:57] the Lord loved you
[53:00] and next because he would keep the oath
[53:03] which he had sworn unto your fathers not
[53:06] literally their fathers but their
[53:08] ancestors Patriarchs Abraham
[53:11] Isaac
[53:13] Jacob
[53:14] because of his oath to them hath the
[53:16] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand
[53:19] this wasn't done in a corner
[53:21] and redeemed you out of the house of
[53:25] bond men
[53:26] they no longer have any claim on you
[53:29] and from the hand of pharaoh king of
[53:32] Egypt the superpower of that time and
[53:35] place
[53:37] no therefore
[53:40] from this you can rest assured you can
[53:43] be fully confident
[53:45] that the Lord thy God
[53:48] he is God
[53:49] the faithful God which keeps Covenant
[53:52] and mercy with them that love him and
[53:55] keep his Commandments to a thousand
[53:57] Generations that's not a math equation
[53:59] well a thousand how long is your
[54:01] generation when's the Lord going to stop
[54:02] keeping his Covenant and of between 20
[54:05] and 40 000 years no no no it means
[54:07] continually
[54:09] it's just an expression
[54:12] so we see
[54:14] Israel was chosen of God
[54:17] because God wanted to express his love
[54:20] and demonstrate his reliability
[54:24] to and through a group that would
[54:26] otherwise be easily overlooked or
[54:30] ignored
[54:31] at Sinai we're told that people chose
[54:34] law over Grace
[54:36] prior to that they had the Covenant of
[54:39] Noah what were the rules under the
[54:41] norwayic Covenant don't eat blood don't
[54:43] murder be fruitful and multiply
[54:46] not too many rules
[54:48] and with Abraham he added one more
[54:51] circumcision
[54:53] that's not a lot
[54:55] it's pretty much it
[54:57] well not
[54:59] let's review the calling of the Gentiles
[55:02] us
[55:04] of Ephesians chapter two starting at
[55:06] verse 1.
[55:08] and you
[55:09] Paul says again plural speaking to each
[55:12] member of the Ephesian Church you hath
[55:15] he quickened that means Made Alive
[55:19] who were dead in trespasses and sins so
[55:23] they're not just made alive like a
[55:25] newborn
[55:26] they're resurrected from death
[55:29] they were dead and are now alive
[55:33] wherein that is in that state of
[55:36] trespass and sin and time passed
[55:40] before you were quickened you walked you
[55:43] lived according to the course of this
[55:46] world according to the prince of the
[55:49] power of the air
[55:50] Satan the spirit that now works
[55:55] and the children of disobedience
[55:57] what we call Satan's Eden
[56:01] among whom
[56:03] that is among the children of
[56:06] Disobedience also we all
[56:09] we Paul has changed from telling them to
[56:13] including himself in that group he's a
[56:16] Jew Jew in tangile
[56:18] we had our conversation our way of life
[56:21] in Times past and the lusts of our flesh
[56:24] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[56:26] of the Mind
[56:27] and we're by Nature
[56:30] the children of Wrath
[56:32] even as others
[56:34] we weren't special
[56:36] or even distinguishable from the mass of
[56:39] humanity around us
[56:41] but God
[56:43] who is Rich
[56:45] virtually without limit and abundance
[56:48] and mercy
[56:50] kindness
[56:52] forgiveness
[56:54] for his tiny
[56:56] no
[56:58] for his great love
[57:01] wherewith He Who
[57:04] God
[57:05] loved
[57:07] who
[57:08] us
[57:10] that includes you
[57:13] I'm thankful by faith I can claim it
[57:15] includes me
[57:18] even
[57:19] when we
[57:21] all of us
[57:22] were already worse past tense we're
[57:26] already dead in sins
[57:29] hath quickened
[57:31] brought us to life
[57:33] resurrected redeemed
[57:35] cooking does together with
[57:38] United Us in and with Christ
[57:42] and then he tells us by goodness
[57:46] oh no it doesn't say that by diligent
[57:49] effort
[57:51] no
[57:53] by unmerited favor by grace
[57:56] are you saved
[57:59] and have already
[58:02] half he's already raised us up
[58:06] us Jew and Gentile together
[58:12] that's an important word
[58:14] it's an important concept it's the title
[58:18] of the sermon together together is to
[58:21] gather
[58:23] together and made us sit with social
[58:26] distancing
[58:29] made us sit together
[58:31] in Heavenly places
[58:34] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[58:38] time without end
[58:40] he might show the exceeding the
[58:43] boundless the Limitless the incomparable
[58:47] the infinite Riches of his grace
[58:51] how
[58:52] in his kindness toward us through Christ
[58:57] Jesus
[59:00] for by by that very boundless Grace are
[59:05] ye each and all
[59:08] saved
[59:09] from death and destruction
[59:12] through faith which you worked hard to
[59:15] achieve
[59:16] no
[59:17] not of yourselves
[59:20] not by your own efforts the grace that
[59:23] brought you that Faith it's a gift
[59:26] it's tendered to us
[59:30] of God
[59:32] now as with any gift
[59:34] if I offer it to you you have to accept
[59:36] it
[59:38] you have to possess it you have to reach
[59:40] out and take it
[59:41] otherwise it's offered
[59:44] but if you don't receive it it has no
[59:47] value to you it has no benefit
[59:50] Paul underscores this
[59:52] by rephrasing
[59:54] he says again it's not of works
[59:57] it's not by what you do
[59:59] he says lest
[1:00:01] lest that's an interesting word one
[1:00:04] syllable but it means in order to
[1:00:07] prevent that
[1:00:08] any man should boast
[1:00:12] and now the verse brother Aaron's been
[1:00:14] patiently expounding to us
[1:00:16] for we
[1:00:18] Paul
[1:00:19] the Believers at Ephesus
[1:00:22] you here tonight me
[1:00:25] we are his
[1:00:27] who's
[1:00:29] God's workmanship
[1:00:31] created in Christ Jesus unto for the
[1:00:35] purpose of
[1:00:36] good works
[1:00:38] wait a minute we're not doing it by
[1:00:41] works but we're created so we have we're
[1:00:44] here we're created to do the things God
[1:00:46] requires your desires of us
[1:00:48] our Salvation is not dependent or earned
[1:00:51] by that or through them
[1:00:52] it's a response
[1:00:55] what we do is a response which God hath
[1:00:59] before ordained
[1:01:00] that we should so live that we should
[1:01:03] walk in them
[1:01:05] well let's skip down to verse 13.
[1:01:08] but someday
[1:01:11] no it doesn't say that
[1:01:13] no but now
[1:01:16] where
[1:01:17] in Christ Jesus
[1:01:20] who who sometimes at other times in the
[1:01:24] past were far off
[1:01:26] Outsiders
[1:01:28] have been made by
[1:01:30] brought in
[1:01:32] made Insiders
[1:01:34] how
[1:01:35] by the blood of Christ
[1:01:38] the life is in the blood the the the
[1:01:41] nephesh the Hebrew the the nature
[1:01:44] the nature of that life is in the blood
[1:01:46] that he shed for us for he
[1:01:50] who
[1:01:51] Jesus is our peace
[1:01:54] who hath made both one and hath broken
[1:01:57] down the middle wall of partition
[1:01:59] between us
[1:02:00] between Jew and Gentile between man and
[1:02:03] God
[1:02:04] the song that we sang as we opened the
[1:02:07] service he is our peace
[1:02:10] he is broken down every wall
[1:02:14] so Paul says he's broken down that
[1:02:16] middle wall of partition between us
[1:02:18] verse 15 having abolished
[1:02:20] banished destroyed
[1:02:24] cast away from us in his flesh the
[1:02:28] enmity the adversarial relationship
[1:02:32] the distrust
[1:02:34] the hostility
[1:02:36] even the law of Commandments contained
[1:02:39] in ordinances for to in order to make it
[1:02:44] himself of Twain of the two
[1:02:47] one
[1:02:48] new man
[1:02:50] and so making peace
[1:02:55] well what is this middle wall of
[1:02:58] partition
[1:03:00] that's mentioned in verse 14.
[1:03:06] Paul is using a physical barrier to
[1:03:08] illustrate this there there was a wall
[1:03:10] of separation between Jew and Gentile
[1:03:13] in the temple
[1:03:16] in the second temple period
[1:03:18] the time in which Paul lived and wrote
[1:03:21] there was a stone barrier or wall that
[1:03:25] separated the Sanctified space for only
[1:03:27] Jews who were purified could enter
[1:03:30] outside of that wall was the the profane
[1:03:33] space where anyone could be Gentiles
[1:03:35] included we we see this uh illustration
[1:03:39] of somebody's conception of what the
[1:03:41] temple and that wall and that Temple
[1:03:43] Mount might have looked like
[1:03:45] so this image is illustrating that wall
[1:03:49] but again it's not necessarily how it
[1:03:51] looked we don't know how it looked it
[1:03:53] was all destroyed in 80 70 and so were
[1:03:56] all the people that were taking selfies
[1:03:58] in front of it so we don't have any of
[1:04:00] those images
[1:04:02] this image however
[1:04:05] is from a stone wall that was part of
[1:04:08] that middle Wall of Separation
[1:04:12] it was likely near a gator entry point
[1:04:14] where one could move from the profane to
[1:04:16] the Sanctified space
[1:04:20] that's a little hard to read
[1:04:23] um let's see if this helps
[1:04:26] is that better
[1:04:27] uh
[1:04:29] not so much okay well the inscription
[1:04:32] for for those of you who are somewhat
[1:04:34] challenged and classical Greek it it
[1:04:37] says No Stranger is to enter within the
[1:04:41] balustrade the wall round the temple and
[1:04:44] enclosure
[1:04:46] whoever is caught
[1:04:48] will be himself responsible
[1:04:51] for his ensuing death
[1:04:54] you cross this line
[1:04:55] you die
[1:04:57] not exactly a welcome mat
[1:05:00] but the blood of Christ
[1:05:02] not only breaks down that figurative
[1:05:04] wall between Jew and Gentile that breaks
[1:05:06] down the wall that separates us
[1:05:12] well
[1:05:14] let's talk about some of these
[1:05:16] scriptures we've read see what common
[1:05:18] thread there might be among them
[1:05:20] if we find such a thread maybe we can
[1:05:23] apply it to our lives and be more like
[1:05:25] Jesus tonight
[1:05:27] tomorrow the next day
[1:05:32] first we read about Elijah and Elisha
[1:05:38] Elisha knew Elijah's time was up his
[1:05:41] ministry
[1:05:42] was coming to a close
[1:05:44] as they journey to Elijah's departure
[1:05:47] gate if you will others along the way
[1:05:49] told Elisha that Elijah was leaving
[1:05:52] Elisha told them I know hold your peace
[1:05:55] this is not news
[1:05:58] Elijah kept telling him to stay here or
[1:06:01] stay there
[1:06:03] but Elisha was too stubborn
[1:06:06] he declared he would not leave Elijah's
[1:06:08] aside
[1:06:09] you're stuck with me
[1:06:12] well after Crossing Jordan
[1:06:14] and closing in on his final moments
[1:06:17] Elijah find the AST Elijah
[1:06:20] well what is it you want
[1:06:23] and Elisha replied he wanted a double
[1:06:26] portion he wanted to continue the
[1:06:28] ministry of the Prophet after Elijah had
[1:06:30] left the scene
[1:06:33] Elijah said
[1:06:34] that's a tough one but if you see me
[1:06:37] if you see me go
[1:06:39] okay
[1:06:40] if not
[1:06:42] no and I'm sure Elijah said if you think
[1:06:45] I was sticking close to you before watch
[1:06:47] me now
[1:06:48] Elisha did see the event
[1:06:52] and he cried out it was a terrible loss
[1:06:55] he mourned
[1:06:57] Elijah's departure
[1:07:00] but brother Watkins on Sunday morning
[1:07:02] made I think was a very important
[1:07:04] observation
[1:07:06] that Elisha not only had to see Elijah
[1:07:09] leave
[1:07:10] but he had to accept
[1:07:13] that Elijah had left
[1:07:16] let's pick up the story where we left
[1:07:18] off see what happened verse 12 we read
[1:07:20] this before and Elisha saw Elijah being
[1:07:23] carried away and he cried my father my
[1:07:25] father
[1:07:26] The Chariot of Israel the horsemen
[1:07:29] thereof
[1:07:30] and Elisha saw Elijah no more
[1:07:34] Elisha took hold of his own clothes and
[1:07:37] rent them in two pieces
[1:07:39] a sign of Anguish mourning over the loss
[1:07:43] of a loved one or a dear friend
[1:07:46] but that didn't end it
[1:07:48] he didn't stop
[1:07:50] stock he didn't have a pity party
[1:07:52] wallowing self-pity or despair
[1:07:57] he took up also the mantle that's the
[1:08:01] cloak the coat the outer garment
[1:08:05] kind of like a I guess sarapis or
[1:08:08] sleeveless kind of like a sleeveless
[1:08:10] Sarape that Elijah that fell from him
[1:08:13] and he went back
[1:08:16] he got up
[1:08:17] from his anguish
[1:08:19] and his Mourning
[1:08:21] and he returned
[1:08:23] and stood by the bank of Jordan
[1:08:27] and Elisha took the mantle of Elijah
[1:08:30] that fell from him and
[1:08:33] smoke the waters
[1:08:35] just as he'd seen Elijah do
[1:08:38] and said where is the god of Elijah
[1:08:44] and we're told when Elisha had also Smit
[1:08:47] in the waters
[1:08:49] they parted hither and thither
[1:08:52] and Elisha went over
[1:08:55] just as he expected to
[1:09:00] he believed the promise he believed the
[1:09:03] word spoken to him by the prophet of his
[1:09:05] time
[1:09:06] he'd made a request and he knew he had
[1:09:09] fulfilled his portion of the requirement
[1:09:12] contained in the answer
[1:09:15] so he became not an imitation Elijah
[1:09:20] but an imitator of Elijah
[1:09:24] did exactly what Elijah had done
[1:09:29] last time that I spoke I talked about
[1:09:31] not being an imitation Jesus
[1:09:35] but an imitator of Christ
[1:09:39] so Elisha came to the Jordan
[1:09:42] I took that cloak of Elijah he had
[1:09:44] retrieved when Elijah was taken from the
[1:09:46] scene and he exercised his faith
[1:09:51] he struck the surface of the water
[1:09:54] he expected
[1:09:56] the same result
[1:09:58] and he got
[1:10:00] the same result
[1:10:03] he didn't get a wet cloak that he had to
[1:10:05] now go squeeze out and put on a cactus
[1:10:08] somewhere to dry no he got a dry path
[1:10:11] through the midst of the waters
[1:10:13] across back to the world in which he
[1:10:16] lived
[1:10:17] the place he was called of God to be
[1:10:20] and his life became an extension
[1:10:24] of the same testimony
[1:10:26] the same power
[1:10:28] the same anointing
[1:10:30] the same witness that the Prophet Elijah
[1:10:33] had
[1:10:33] now right after this when he gets to
[1:10:36] Jericho we're told that they pestered
[1:10:37] had been pestered and they wanted to
[1:10:39] send out a search party well maybe he
[1:10:41] fell out of that Whirlwind and he stuck
[1:10:42] on a rock somewhere we got to go find
[1:10:44] him he might be hurt
[1:10:46] so they sent out the search party for
[1:10:49] three days
[1:10:50] they went looking for an injured or dead
[1:10:54] Elijah
[1:10:56] no
[1:10:58] they came back empty Hampton
[1:11:01] they had a hard time accepting what
[1:11:04] Elisha do
[1:11:06] the prophet was taken
[1:11:08] and it was time to move on
[1:11:12] the same Ministry but greater this
[1:11:14] double portion
[1:11:16] Jesus said Greater Works than these
[1:11:19] shall you do because I go to my father
[1:11:21] now we know one example of that is
[1:11:24] greater in number right
[1:11:28] but brother Paul Dirksen pointed out
[1:11:30] that because our times are after the
[1:11:34] cross
[1:11:35] after the resurrection
[1:11:37] after the Ascension when the blood of
[1:11:40] the atonement would be sprinkled on the
[1:11:41] Heavenly altar that
[1:11:43] that the way he expressed it we can
[1:11:45] impart eternal life
[1:11:47] that sounds a little strange bear with
[1:11:49] me it's not by waving a magic wand and
[1:11:52] saying some sort of incantation in the
[1:11:54] name of Jesus
[1:11:56] but by using the keys to the kingdom
[1:11:59] the same way that Peter did
[1:12:02] at Pentecost
[1:12:04] which all whoever sends you retained or
[1:12:07] retained whoever sins you remit they're
[1:12:08] remitted but it's not by going to a
[1:12:10] priest and lighting a candle and doing
[1:12:12] some penance
[1:12:14] no this is how Peter did it
[1:12:17] in Acts 2 38.
[1:12:19] he said the promise they were asking
[1:12:21] them what's going on so he's talking
[1:12:23] about the infilling of the spirit is
[1:12:24] prophesied by Joel that promises to you
[1:12:28] it's to your children
[1:12:30] it's to them that will come later
[1:12:34] here's how repent
[1:12:37] you have something to do repent be
[1:12:41] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:12:43] the remission of sins whose sins you
[1:12:45] remit they're remitted and you shall
[1:12:48] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:52] like Elisha
[1:12:55] we have to recognize
[1:12:57] our Elijah's left the scene
[1:13:01] pick up the mantle I'm not talking about
[1:13:03] an eighth day messenger I'm not talking
[1:13:05] about a replacement Prophet I'm not
[1:13:07] talking about that
[1:13:09] he dropped it to us
[1:13:11] and we have to pick it up and carry on
[1:13:14] it's not some sort of a return Ministry
[1:13:16] but the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:18] through the bride the body of Christ
[1:13:22] if Jesus is Alive and doing then he is
[1:13:25] alive and doing
[1:13:27] Know Who You Are
[1:13:30] step into the role
[1:13:32] the anointing from God and our Modern
[1:13:35] English pick up not the cloak not the
[1:13:38] mantle but pick up the ball run with it
[1:13:43] stop living below our privileges in
[1:13:45] Christ while while stop living below
[1:13:48] your privileges in Christ
[1:13:51] there's something else in all of this
[1:13:54] that I read to you this evening I I
[1:13:56] wanted you to see these promises these
[1:13:59] admonitions are not just to each of us
[1:14:02] individually they are
[1:14:04] but they apply to us collectively
[1:14:08] we saw that in the case of Israel God
[1:14:10] spoke to Moses a person singular
[1:14:13] to deliver his message of that hour to
[1:14:15] his chosen people
[1:14:17] plural
[1:14:18] it was then up to that nation that group
[1:14:21] of individuals
[1:14:23] to carry out that message it was
[1:14:25] delivered to them they individually had
[1:14:28] to perform each part so the group as a
[1:14:31] whole
[1:14:33] could fulfill their calling
[1:14:37] Moses didn't enter The Promise Land with
[1:14:40] him
[1:14:41] he saw it he described it brother
[1:14:44] Branham told us about what we call the
[1:14:46] Rapture the catching away the return he
[1:14:51] warned us to not miss it
[1:14:53] he wanted to be a part of it alive at
[1:14:56] the return of the Lord for his chosen
[1:14:59] he told us it's so very close
[1:15:05] but his body lies in the dust of the
[1:15:07] Earth
[1:15:08] as for almost 60 years
[1:15:12] and the message brother Watkins brought
[1:15:14] us he showed us that brother Branham
[1:15:16] told those here in Tucson at that time
[1:15:18] to attend the Tabernacle it was the only
[1:15:21] message church at that time to lendeth
[1:15:23] their support
[1:15:24] to gather together
[1:15:27] to worship
[1:15:28] it was the only what we now call Message
[1:15:31] Church here at that time
[1:15:33] this church was established 57 years ago
[1:15:36] this week I first attended it 56 years
[1:15:40] ago two weeks from now
[1:15:43] brother green
[1:15:45] founded this church she's been gone for
[1:15:47] seven years
[1:15:49] we have like Elisha we have to move on
[1:15:53] I'm reminded of the title of a message
[1:15:55] brother Branham brought what shall I do
[1:15:58] with Jesus called Christ
[1:16:01] shortly after this was towards the end
[1:16:03] of his ministry he brought it again with
[1:16:04] the revised title what shall we do with
[1:16:07] this Jesus called Christ the text being
[1:16:10] from Matthew 27 when pilate was
[1:16:13] appealing to the crowd
[1:16:15] Brother Brad has subtitled it Jesus on
[1:16:17] our hands I'm not saying that we should
[1:16:19] move on from the message
[1:16:22] not at all please don't misunderstand
[1:16:25] I'm saying we need to move on with the
[1:16:28] message
[1:16:29] be what we're called to be manifest
[1:16:33] Jesus Christ who are lost and Dying
[1:16:35] World spread the good news while Mercy
[1:16:38] is still available
[1:16:40] just like Elisha moved on with a the
[1:16:42] anointing the spirit the life that was
[1:16:44] in Elijah
[1:16:46] the Bride of Jesus Christ the called out
[1:16:49] must move on with the same Holy Spirit
[1:16:52] Supernatural anointing that was brought
[1:16:55] to us by God through the messenger to
[1:16:57] our age
[1:16:58] just as Israel had to move on with the
[1:17:01] word that Moses fought
[1:17:03] when Noah entered the Ark the rain had
[1:17:07] not yet started
[1:17:09] but it was too late to enter
[1:17:11] when the coming storm was apparent to
[1:17:14] everyone
[1:17:15] the door by then
[1:17:17] had been sealed shut
[1:17:19] I wonder how Noah must have felt
[1:17:23] rain coming down people frightened
[1:17:25] scared screaming running around the ark
[1:17:27] pounding on the door let me in I can't
[1:17:30] trying to as the water level Rose trying
[1:17:33] to climb up the side
[1:17:35] drowning
[1:17:38] they wouldn't listen
[1:17:40] they wouldn't listen
[1:17:43] you know something else
[1:17:46] we can't make it on our own
[1:17:48] one separated from the other
[1:17:51] Paul wrote that the blood of Jesus
[1:17:53] breaks down the wall of separation
[1:17:57] in the world of churches at large
[1:18:00] denominational walls exist
[1:18:03] those who also really just disagreements
[1:18:06] on interpretation of some scripture or
[1:18:09] doctrine
[1:18:12] I'm afraid that in this message
[1:18:14] there are many denominations
[1:18:18] walls
[1:18:20] separation over some interpretation of
[1:18:23] the Bible or some quote
[1:18:26] or just finding fault in others what
[1:18:29] Jesus called the moat and the beam in
[1:18:31] the eyes
[1:18:34] I was so glad
[1:18:36] when brother Aaron canceled the Sunday
[1:18:39] evening surface
[1:18:40] for the purpose of us all going to
[1:18:43] worship and fellowship with our sister
[1:18:44] Church
[1:18:45] Shalom Tabernacle
[1:18:48] it's vital I believe that we realize
[1:18:51] that we it's not only we as a
[1:18:54] congregation that are in this thing
[1:18:55] together
[1:18:57] but we're also in the body of Christ
[1:18:59] together with our sister churches
[1:19:04] brother Watkins read some excerpts from
[1:19:07] what house would you build me which
[1:19:09] brother Branham spoke at Tucson
[1:19:11] Tabernacle the Second Sunday it was in
[1:19:13] existence November 21
[1:19:15] 1965.
[1:19:18] as I was
[1:19:20] seeking the Lord preparing the Lord what
[1:19:22] is it that you want for Wednesday
[1:19:25] I read that message yesterday afternoon
[1:19:28] and some parts of it struck me really
[1:19:30] hard
[1:19:32] I mean hit me over the head
[1:19:35] made me sad
[1:19:37] made me wonder which areas
[1:19:40] is liable guilty
[1:19:43] and how to correct
[1:19:45] those things
[1:19:47] I want to read a
[1:19:49] few small portions of that service
[1:19:52] some of which would be the same we heard
[1:19:54] Sunday morning I'll make a few comments
[1:19:56] as I read and I'll try to be clear where
[1:19:58] I'm commenting rather than
[1:20:00] reading
[1:20:03] what house will you build me
[1:20:05] 1965.
[1:20:08] but he meaning God the Lord is this is
[1:20:12] both of random saying but he as far as I
[1:20:14] know anything I know of God I I was sent
[1:20:17] by a vision to Tucson
[1:20:19] I've wondered how I ever was sent to
[1:20:21] this desert place
[1:20:24] and then here where there is
[1:20:27] spiritually speaking over the city he
[1:20:30] says I don't know of any place that's
[1:20:32] any more spiritual dead than in the city
[1:20:34] of Los Angeles
[1:20:36] oh
[1:20:38] no
[1:20:40] no he proclaimed judgment on Los Angeles
[1:20:42] right
[1:20:43] but
[1:20:45] no city is more dead he says than the
[1:20:49] City of Tucson
[1:20:52] Tucson
[1:20:54] why do you say that brother Branham
[1:20:57] what's the reason for this spiritual
[1:21:00] death
[1:21:02] here it comes
[1:21:03] he says there is war
[1:21:06] between the churches
[1:21:10] he says there's fusses
[1:21:12] between the congregations
[1:21:15] there's no Unity
[1:21:17] everyone grabbing and holding and
[1:21:19] squeezing and trying to get this one and
[1:21:21] prosely Lighting
[1:21:22] it's a desert spiritually speaking also
[1:21:28] wow
[1:21:30] that was amongst the Pentecostal and
[1:21:32] outer churches here 57 years ago
[1:21:35] and today
[1:21:37] how often do we have joint services or
[1:21:40] activities with other message churches
[1:21:42] in town
[1:21:43] or even non-message churches
[1:21:46] what separates us
[1:21:50] differences in interpretations of the
[1:21:52] message
[1:21:53] people who want to be in charge
[1:21:58] excuse me but I believe that this is
[1:22:00] absolute carnality
[1:22:02] I think that Satan is delighted to see
[1:22:04] that
[1:22:05] to see those walls fighting each other
[1:22:07] means we aren't fighting him
[1:22:10] he has free reign in his Eden
[1:22:14] every January the last several years we
[1:22:16] have Harmony in the desert a supreme
[1:22:19] effort spearheaded by brother Bob Wertz
[1:22:22] to Simply Fellowship
[1:22:24] and Worship the Lord
[1:22:28] gather
[1:22:31] some Churches won't even come
[1:22:33] their pastors won't come
[1:22:37] what did Brother Branham we just read it
[1:22:39] he called this lack of unity he called
[1:22:41] it War
[1:22:44] he called it a symptom of being
[1:22:46] spiritually dead
[1:22:49] it's his words it's not mine we just
[1:22:51] read them this Saturday we have a
[1:22:54] Statewide ministers meeting and there's
[1:22:57] some pastors that won't come
[1:22:59] some that never have come
[1:23:04] my question
[1:23:06] how will there ever be a rapture
[1:23:09] where we're to be caught up together
[1:23:12] to meet the Lord if we can't sit down
[1:23:15] together
[1:23:16] here on Earth
[1:23:19] let's read some more
[1:23:22] he says I'm so grateful brother Perry
[1:23:24] followed the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:25] and today we have a tabernacle it's a
[1:23:28] small one that's just good enough to
[1:23:30] start with to see what the Holy Spirit
[1:23:31] not knowing let's just move step by step
[1:23:35] now I believe if God has spoken to
[1:23:38] brother and sister green to come here
[1:23:39] and has opened a place where our
[1:23:41] children and instead of on Sunday
[1:23:43] morning riding their bicycles on the
[1:23:45] streets and running around they have a
[1:23:47] place to come to worship instead of us
[1:23:49] sitting around and listening to
[1:23:51] something we've heard on radio which is
[1:23:53] all right
[1:23:56] that was 1965.
[1:23:58] there was no church to Fellowship in
[1:24:00] brother Branham wasn't welcome
[1:24:03] No Place To Worship together as as
[1:24:05] believers
[1:24:07] so wind up listening to some service on
[1:24:11] the radio Radio preaching was for those
[1:24:14] who had no church those who had no other
[1:24:16] option
[1:24:19] fast forward this is now 2022.
[1:24:23] now we decided we don't like this
[1:24:25] preacher or that brother or that sister
[1:24:27] they offended us it's something that
[1:24:29] hurt we don't like the music whatever
[1:24:32] so people sit at home
[1:24:34] surf the web scream from this church and
[1:24:37] that church
[1:24:39] streaming my opinion is for those who
[1:24:43] perhaps due to distance or age or
[1:24:46] disability or some other impediment
[1:24:48] cannot physically come to the surface
[1:24:51] and this is just for the while
[1:24:54] I think that if you're physically able
[1:24:57] you need to come to church
[1:25:00] if not this one find one and worship
[1:25:04] there
[1:25:05] every servant is open every service that
[1:25:09] it is open and you can
[1:25:12] you should be there if you don't have
[1:25:15] that urgency
[1:25:16] that drive brother Branham said you
[1:25:19] can't wait for those doors to open if
[1:25:21] you don't have that then force yourself
[1:25:23] to come anyway and when you come come to
[1:25:27] the altar
[1:25:29] and don't leave it
[1:25:30] until that urgency is there
[1:25:34] if you don't
[1:25:37] you're drying up
[1:25:39] and you're depriving the local Body of
[1:25:42] Christ of that portion of his spirit
[1:25:43] that he's placed in you I know
[1:25:46] I've been there
[1:25:48] I've done that I testified to you all
[1:25:51] about that a few weeks ago when I
[1:25:53] separated myself from this body for a
[1:25:55] season
[1:25:57] I was wrong
[1:25:59] dead wrong
[1:26:02] back to brother Branham
[1:26:04] but we as this group of people we have a
[1:26:07] message for this day we we believe God
[1:26:09] has given us a message brother Branham
[1:26:12] goes on talks about brother green
[1:26:13] leaving Texas and coming to Tucson he
[1:26:16] left everything that was dear to him
[1:26:17] also to come to the desert just to
[1:26:19] support what God has given to us now
[1:26:23] brother Branham says I say I I believe
[1:26:25] it's not only should be in our hearts it
[1:26:28] should be our duty to back him up
[1:26:30] everything that we can to attend the
[1:26:33] services to come here to worship to make
[1:26:36] this a place where God can reveal to us
[1:26:38] the things he has for us to reveal
[1:26:43] I want to read that last part again
[1:26:45] spoken in 1965 I think it applies
[1:26:50] in 2022.
[1:26:53] I believe it should not only be in our
[1:26:55] hearts it should be in our duty
[1:26:59] to back him up
[1:27:01] everything that we can to attend the
[1:27:03] services to come here to worship to make
[1:27:06] this a place where God can reveal to us
[1:27:08] the things he has for us to reveal
[1:27:13] and as his word said he's talking about
[1:27:16] what brother green said that brother
[1:27:18] green said the message doesn't come to
[1:27:19] me through the giving of the inspiration
[1:27:21] as it does to maybe some of us but he
[1:27:24] said I'm here to back up what God has
[1:27:26] given
[1:27:28] brother Brandon says what a statement
[1:27:31] and I believe if we will all cooperate
[1:27:35] together
[1:27:37] we'll put our hearts to it
[1:27:40] I know that each one of you
[1:27:42] if you feel like I do I'm so hungry to
[1:27:46] see the spirit of God moving I just
[1:27:48] can't hardly stand it
[1:27:51] cooperate together put our hearts in it
[1:27:54] some experiences I've just had up in the
[1:27:56] mountain just to feel that once again
[1:27:58] that's something when I was first Saved
[1:28:00] was So Glorious to my heart
[1:28:02] he goes on
[1:28:04] we can come into a place
[1:28:06] we can sit
[1:28:09] and see it among us
[1:28:11] if it were drying
[1:28:14] he says
[1:28:15] I begin to feel us all reclining
[1:28:19] getting away from the spirit
[1:28:21] it's become too natural a thing to us
[1:28:25] we must Worship in the spirit where the
[1:28:28] spirit of God not only our message
[1:28:30] should be the flame of the hour it
[1:28:33] should be the flame in our hearts
[1:28:36] can you hear that song
[1:28:38] burn
[1:28:40] Holy Spirit
[1:28:42] burning me
[1:28:44] set my heart on fire
[1:28:47] fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:28:52] and God's full desire
[1:28:56] back to brother Branham see it's got to
[1:28:59] be in our hearts
[1:29:02] or we can't rightly present it to the
[1:29:04] people the spirit has to pack the
[1:29:07] message itself
[1:29:09] and he says I'm trusting and believing
[1:29:13] in every one of you
[1:29:15] to be a real
[1:29:18] Christian
[1:29:19] if the musicians would come
[1:29:23] of course I'm I'm not saying that
[1:29:27] everyone needs to come to Tucson
[1:29:29] Tabernacle I'm not saying that at all
[1:29:31] there there are other sister churches in
[1:29:33] this area but but everyone who's a real
[1:29:36] Christian
[1:29:37] needs to find a home Church
[1:29:39] just stick with it to put they all they
[1:29:42] can into it
[1:29:44] be in every service you can possibly be
[1:29:46] where the spirit can move not just when
[1:29:49] your favorite preacher is going to be
[1:29:50] there or your unfavorite you're not
[1:29:52] going to go because you really don't
[1:29:53] want that guy no or what did Brother
[1:29:56] Branham say the
[1:29:58] option was
[1:30:00] sit home
[1:30:02] try up
[1:30:05] my brothers
[1:30:06] my sisters
[1:30:08] we are in this together
[1:30:10] I cannot make it without you
[1:30:15] I can't make it without the body of
[1:30:17] Christ I just become a frozen penguin
[1:30:21] perhaps you can make it without me
[1:30:24] but Lord help me to be like Elisha
[1:30:28] you're stuck with me
[1:30:30] God is no respecter of persons
[1:30:34] and none of us
[1:30:36] not what will make it without him
[1:30:40] without him
[1:30:42] I'm just flapping my gums up here and
[1:30:44] wasting your time
[1:30:48] how will all men know you're my
[1:30:50] disciples Jesus said
[1:30:52] our love
[1:30:53] not our separating and picking and
[1:30:55] choosing which minister will come to
[1:30:57] hear and which we won't I so appreciate
[1:31:00] it
[1:31:01] that brother Israel Paul did not
[1:31:04] identify who would be speaking at the
[1:31:06] services
[1:31:07] no pre-announcements
[1:31:10] I remember in the December meeting so
[1:31:12] very many years ago brother green often
[1:31:14] did the same thing
[1:31:16] he came to hear from the Lord
[1:31:18] and trusted the leadership of the holy
[1:31:20] spirit in the ministry to provide what
[1:31:22] you needed
[1:31:25] we need to be here to hear from the Lord
[1:31:28] not to tickle our ears
[1:31:31] gather together the more so as you see
[1:31:33] the day approaching
[1:31:35] the Bible says it
[1:31:37] brother Brandon said it time and again
[1:31:39] through his ministry
[1:31:41] let's be doers
[1:31:44] not just yours
[1:31:46] let's pray together one more time
[1:31:50] Lord Jesus
[1:31:51] some of these words are hard to say
[1:31:55] and I suspect that
[1:31:57] many of the things that were said aren't
[1:31:59] for the people that are necessarily
[1:32:01] sitting here in these pews or even
[1:32:03] necessarily those that are streaming
[1:32:04] maybe it's for some who will listen or
[1:32:07] hear it later I don't know
[1:32:10] but you know
[1:32:12] Lord I just pray that something has been
[1:32:14] said tonight that for each person that's
[1:32:16] come
[1:32:17] that there's something that they can
[1:32:18] grab a hold of that they can grasp but
[1:32:20] that will be an encouragement Lord to
[1:32:23] each Heart Lord to help us grow in you
[1:32:26] closer to you closer to one another Lord
[1:32:29] that we can be seated together in
[1:32:32] Heavenly places together with you
[1:32:35] together with each other
[1:32:38] Lord be with us this week
[1:32:40] the remaining days until we gather
[1:32:43] together again Lord how our hearts
[1:32:45] should be burning
[1:32:46] just can't wait for those doors to open
[1:32:49] that we can have Fellowship again with
[1:32:51] our brothers and sisters to gather
[1:32:53] together to worship you accept our
[1:32:55] worship move by your spirit in our midst
[1:32:58] Lord answer needs in each heart help us
[1:33:00] to grow and grow and glow with the
[1:33:04] gospel
