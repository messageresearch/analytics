driving across town to get here and fellowshipping with us God bless you brother stay with it this morning um I know that that you weren't here this morning you had a a previous engagement um just Jacob I talked about the Lord Jesus and every sermon that I preach that's who I want to talk about you I could I could try to expound on some things and try to try to bring out the scriptures but if I am lifting up Jesus Christ then I believe I am in God's Will and that's what I want to do every service every time I'm up here every time I open the book every time I speak a word I want to lift up Jesus Christ because he's he's God brother liono there's nothing we could say more about him he's God he is God made flesh he's my savior he's my comforter and I really believe he's my friend I'm grateful to have him and I'm grateful that that he uh he knows me um I brother Wesley I'm sorry I didn't welcome you this morning welcome brother Wesley is all the way from the Netherlands in [Applause] Europe it's good to have you bro it nice to meet you today um fine young man loves the Lord he's uh wanted to come visit Arizona and he's he's here by himself and um brother we pray that you enjoy yourself while you're here I I got you some of those books brother Wesley wanted some of the acts of the prophets books and and while brother Jordan and I were back there looking um for the books I found I saw this book right here and it's titled footprints on the sands of time and it was originally published uh by Spoken Word Publications I believe that brother Roy borders is the one that put it together and uh it's it's really a it's really a neat book it's just a it's a um compilation of sermons and uh and then it has some different topics in here and and some different quotes and just some different tracks that spoken word put out it's it's really just a it's it's a neat little book um it's a bit obsolete now because we have software and we have an app that we can just look this stuff up but um it it brought back it brought back some really good memories for me this book I met a man and I've given a testimony about him his name is Don Marsh he was a prisoner for many years um in prison for violent crimes and um he uh drug addict heavy drug user he was he was Airborne in the Army and uh they named his um platoon or I don't know what you call it his group they named him the jumping junkies because they were heroin users heavy heroin users and uh he ended up um assaulting someone going to prison getting out doing it again going back to prison and one day he was just contemplating on on life in general he's in prison and they had a library in uh in the prison there and he uh he looked up and he saw this book sitting on the shelf and it was sticking out a little bit it it was it didn't look like it belonged there so he went and he picked this book up and he started reading it and that began the change in brother Don's life he ended up giving his heart to the Lord Jesus in prison I believe he got baptized in prison he um got out and um he was uh he was there for I don't know a few months in Jeffersonville and I kept uh I walked out of church one day and I I saw him there and if you know me I don't like to have any strangers in church I I I I want to meet everybody and it's not just because I'm Pastor I've always been that way and I saw him standing there so I walked up to him and he was leaning up against the wall and nobody talking with him because I guess he had a reputation and the people knew who he was and uh I walked up to him I shook his hand and and I said hey I've seen you I said I wanted to introduce myself and and he said he says he had the best voice he used to sing me songs and leave them on my voicemail um Stephanie used to get a kick I don't listen to Brother Don singing on my voicemail but uh he said brother he says nobody talks to me and I said something on the order of well so you're calling me a nobody and he said no no he says no man he goes I've done time brother Jer Jeremiah I didn't know what that meant when he said it so I was like what and he says no he says I I I've been in prison and and he says he says nobody wants to talk to me and I said well brother I'd like to get to know you so that was the beginning of of a just a wonderful friendship between Brother Don and I and he ended up just he ended up being just a wonderful person and he ended up dying of liver cancer from all of those years of of abusing his body with alcohol and drugs and um I just got to say say he's one of those people that when they go on you know you miss him and I miss Brother Don he's probably been uh I don't know five or six years since he passed away but he was truly a testimony of God's grace he was the worst of the worst violent belligerent um drug using criminal and God changed him and it was this book right here was the St of his change so when brother Jordan and I were back there looking and I saw this book I just thought you know I'd like to tell the church about that testimony I uh I had a nice day we had lunch lunch with brother Wesley there and um some of the some of the Brethren and um I was uh before we went to lunch I was talking with brother Kevin sister Connie Cary and I just every person I just appreciate this whole congregation so much everyone has tremendous strengths and I was talking with sister Connie and and we were just fellowshipping about how the Lord can use each one of us and he can lay things on our heart to allow us to maybe enter into the suffering of someone else I was just in the back praying for my son Daniel I've had a toothache before and it's an awful awful thing so I was able to enter into that suffering with him and and pray for him and it's not just because I love him but it's because I've been there and that's Jacob that's what I was talking about this morning is the Lord Jesus how he can enter into our suffering because he's been there and he he knows how it is is to for people to talk bad about you he knows how it is for the enemy to come into your mind and try to poison your thoughts because he's been there he was tempted in the wilderness for when he fasted for 40 days Satan came to him was trying to get in his head Satan even tried to get him to commit suicide to jump off the temple so Jesus knows how it is he knows how it is to get down he knows how it is to AR arue to feel like you want to argue with someone he he he's been there and yet we're going to read in the book of Hebrews yet he was without sin he was he was great Jacob he's my hero he's you know we look at when we're growing up and and we're looking at athletes and we're looking at famous people and and and all these these Great Men I never had any Heroes there I I always um liked the the superheroes you know and the AC action figures and all that when I was little but now I see that they are all just a copy of Jesus Christ he is the superhero he is awesome Not only was he did he have like Powers unlimited Powers which is that is so neat but he also had compassion he was a hero he he he had love and he he he could he could help somebody when they're really down they could come to him like Mary magdalin did and he just had a way just to make it all go away so much so that all of my sins and all of I I have committed in my life he just sister Debbie just W wiped it right away I'm so happy I'm just so thankful that he could do that I I think about look at this book when I think about that man Don Marsh big giant intimidating guy and yet he got to come into the presence of Jesus Christ at his death no matter how bad he was no matter what he had done and I would venture to bet that he had done far worse than anyone in this building right now and yet Jesus Christ was able to save that man and to bring him into his presence and when he died he was glorifying God uh Daniel and I would go visit him on his on his deathbed and and the guy just loved Jesus he he was he was just so happy we were talk about doctrinal stuff and he'd he'd say brother I just don't know where all this is coming from can't we just focus on God I was like yes amen he he just he had it I um I just miss that guy so much he was he was really really a special person let's um I have a fairly short message tonight we will finish up with um Hebrews chapter 4 and then we I think we can get through chapter 5 tonight so I read part of chapter 4 this morning so let's start with uh let's just go ahead and start with with verse one and um I believe stopped on on verse 5 so then we will um we'll we'll go on with verse 6 through the end but let's start with verse one it says this let us fear let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should she seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest again he's quoting Psalm 95 there and let's continue on to verse six it says this seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief let me read the um I believe it's it's the Amplified version of the of verse six therefore since the promise remains for some to enter his rest and those who formerly had the good news preached to them failed to grasp it and did not enter because of their their unbelief evidenced by Disobedience so it shows that that the evidence of our unbelief is our sins and is our Disobedience again he limith a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart so again he sets a definite day it's a new day today providing another opportunity to enter into that rest saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before in the words that were already quoted again Psalm 95 verse eight for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day does that sound strange I heard brother Lyall Mumble it under his breath so it's King James so when he says that if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward word have spoken of of another day the the author here is talking about when Moses had had gone to be with the Lord and Joshua had taken them over into the promised land and the the translation as it comes through it was Joshua was has been translated as Jesus and really yahoshua I believe is the the Hebrew name for it Jesus and Joshua are actually the same name so the the the way that this is translated into English here it's actually for if Joshua had given them rest then would he have not afterward of spoken of another day remember when Joshua and and the children of Israel remember when they went over into Jordan they went over into the promised land and and God was saying that that he wouldn't give that first generation any rest he he wouldn't give them the promised land because they rebelled against him they provoked God so they all died out except for Joshua and Caleb and they bring the people over the Jordan River and they fight this battle at Jericho that is not rest that's not peace even though they went over into the promised land so what the author here is saying is that does not fulfill this rest of the Sabbath that was that was promised so they uh that was just filled with with problems there was it was ACH and sin at Jericho when he took the wedge of gold and then a bunch of they lost the battle at Ai and and it was just problems they were fighting with Giants and and then another person would sin and and and this was just a very very difficult time but yet it was in the promised land but there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God it wasn't fulfilled there in the Old Testament for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his so when you truly enter into the rest of God then you will no longer be doing your old works so what are the old works that we're talking about here there's sin so when you enter into God's rest when you are baptized into the faith when you are making a you are making a commitment that that old person that was here that was sinful changed into a new person and that new person is doing his best to serve God again my friend Don Marsh he was a rough one he is he is a great example because it's such a start contrast he goes and he's he's partying and he's he's shooting up and he's fighting and he's he's he's committing crimes and he's doing all these things he goes to prison he he he finds the Lord he he gets baptized he makes this commitment and now his sins are washed away and he's a different person he was very much a different person but yet he still sinned he still made mistakes but there was something different that difference was he repented and he was trying to be right and God honored that so again when we're baptized into the faith then we are making a commitment that that old person is changed into a new person and this new person is going to do his best to serve God let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of UN belief so sin can only come through unbelief if you really believe that there is a God and you really believe that he punishes sin then you wouldn't sin in the first place knowingly sin you wouldn't do it in the first place if you really believed so sin and unbelief they really they go hand in hand brother brandom even said one time he he made a statement actually many times he said that there is only one sin and that's unbelief and now you can see why that's true is because that you you wouldn't really do it if you knew that God was watching if you knew he was right there you knew that you would have to answer for this you probably wouldn't do it in the first place but because of a lack of faith then we go and we sin for the word of God is quick I like that word it means alive for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of the Soul and Spirit of the joints and of the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intense of the heart what that means is God can look down into my mind into my heart and he knows my motives he knows everything that I have done he knows all of my sins he knows everything about me there is nothing hidden before God and it says the word of God is is powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword a two-edged sword if it's very sharp when you when you thrust that sword in it cuts on both sides it goes it it goes smoothly in It just strikes right to the heart and that's how the word of God is and it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it knows everything and then in the in um John chapter one it says in the beginning was the word the discerner of the of the the thoughts and and the the joints and the marrow and the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and it and it it's everything it knows everything about us and then it says in John chapter 1 it says in the beginning was the word this what what I just read and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen so we know that God and the word they are the same thing and then later on in that chapter chapter I believe it's verse 14 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us which was Jesus Christ himself neither is there any creature that is not manifested in his sight that's not just open in his sight he knows everything but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do English Standard Version says and no creature is hidden from his sight but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him who to whom we must give an account so if we believe God is real then we must believe that he knows every sin that we commit he knows everything that we're doing and we look back and we think of that man that I mentioned this morning that was picking up sticks and he met his condemnation and if God sees that that sin it was pointed out God knew it was happening it was pointed out and there came to punishment but now if we truly accept Jesus Christ and that sin it it may be present but it becomes wiped out through the blood of Jesus Christ and then God looks down and he can't see it all he can see is Jesus it's a good testimony never thought about that if if God looks down at me and my sins and everything that about me and all he sees is Jesus man it's neat that we can look around and then all we can see is Jesus and that's the only thing I want to see is Jesus Christ seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast to our profession so the author of this he may not have been there but he knew the disciples like Peter and James and John he knew those brothers and they gave him witness they said hey that we were there Jesus raised from the dead and he was with us and then he went up into heaven and we watched him going up when we were sitting there like wow and then these two angels said hey what are you looking up in the sky for and he said angel said listen that he is going to come down in the like manner that he went up telling he's going to come back this man Jesus Christ he went up and he's God he's up he ascended up to the right hand of God but he is also coming back and he's going to come back in the same way that he left and we're looking for that today for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are so he knew he' been there he knew how was to be tempted he knew he knew what that was but yet without sin that's just amazing let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need it's a throne of grace and it's not a throne of Justice if it was that Throne of Justice we would all be lost but Jesus Christ stood for us Hebrews chapter 5 for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins so this is the high priest who is ordained to go into the holy of holies like we talked about this morning and present the sacrifice and the offering and stand in Pre in the presence of God the Father that is what it is for every high priest is taken from among men so so one of these men one of these Levites is ordained as the high priest for these things pertaining to God and this high priest this man who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity so this high priest this man we're not talking about Jesus here we're talking about the man he is able to have compassion on the ignorant because he himself also has faults a sister came to me the other day and she told me that she doubted her salvation because of the sins that were in her past and it was just the hardest thing for her to get over and she was she was telling me about all these things that she had done and and that God hasn't forgiven her for these sins and she is just filled with guilt for these past mistakes that's a very common thing by the way and especially and many times is with the sisters they really have a tough time getting over mistakes that they have made the some of the brothers do too but it's it's hard for certain personalities and certain people to get over that and she feels feels like she's not forgiven and my answer to her was that sister it doesn't matter if you feel forgiven or not your your feelings really don't matter in this it's have you repented of your sins have you asked God for forgiveness of those sins and no matter what the sin is then you have a promise that they are forgiven and you can always there's always something that you can there's always a some sort of a loophole that you can say well I'm not saved you can always do it because that's that's in your mind but the fact is the formula is that if you repent of these sins you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you bring these sins before the Lord you lay them out the altar say Lord I'm not able to do anything about this and then he forgives you that's called Christianity and it's so hard for for many times it's so hard for us to just lay those sins aside we sinned In the Flesh so many times we have to suffer in the flesh but remember that's just the flesh this flesh is carnal it's going to be gone one day it's it's going to cease to exist so you may have sinned like like Don he sinned and he heard his body and he suffered towards the end of his life for that but but that was his flesh he was as pure as pure can be inside in his soul and the spirit that that feeling that we have of that guilt and and and that that just hits people so hard that Spirit of condemnation does not come from God if you have made things right then that cannot be from God Satan right now is at the Throne of God condemning each of us for our sins but Jesus Christ stands between Satan and the father and he is the pritu for that sin he is paying for that sin let's read it let's uh let's turn to Revelation chapter 12 yeah Revelation chapter I think chapter yeah Revelation 12 verse 10 it says this and I heard a loud voice in heaven now is come salvation and strength and and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night so he's there if you feel that SP if you feel that Spirit of condemnation coming what you're doing is you're just feeling that Devil's con that he's he's he's accusing you and you're getting a little bit of that imagine if you were on trial and you hear the prosecuting attorney telling the judge everything that you've done wrong imagine how that would make you feel and here he is he's saying well in the secret life that no one else can see here's what he did here is what she did and you're just thinking oh this is so bad the judge is hearing this and you feel this this guilt and that's what we're feeling when we can't when we can't we don't have to forgive ourselves by the way that's a worldly statement oh you got to forgive yourself before you can forgive everything no no no that's that's not the forgiveness is not up to us as far as ourselves we forgive other people but ourselves we don't have that power it's up to him to forgive us but imagine how you feel when all of those accusations and the fact is that those accusations are true but someone else took the blame for you and we are immune from prosecution we have diplomatic immunity nobody can accuse us Satan cannot accuse us because my fair has been paid my sins have been covered they have been paid for so you have your salvation through the sacrifice of Christ but the devil is still accusing you David said in the Psalms he said restore the joy of my Salvation let's just read it Psalm 51 I love this man I love this Psalm 51 uh 13 you know let's just read let's just read from verse one it says this Psalm 51 it says have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before for me against thee thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me we're born Sinners behold thou desirest truth let me let me go back to that when I said we were born Sinners I mentioned this on Wednesday night I want to mention it again because I believe that it pleased the Lord we are born some of us may be born Liars some of us may be born thieves some of us may be born uh with a loose tongue others as I was witnessing to those boys on Wednesday night one of them may be born with a perverted Spirit homosexual Spirit maybe born with that I'm not saying I I know a lot of the a lot of the churches say oh well you're not born with that well you can be born with these other things why can't you be born with that the answer is you can but the answer also is that you can overcome those things no matter what the sin you will not be tempted in you so much that that you cannot overcome amen and David here is saying behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me I was born in sin and I was shaped in iniquity behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with hup and I shall be clean you know what hup is hup is just a common weed a common plant in Israel that they used to apply the blood for the atonement it says here it says Purge me with hup and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou Hast broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities Lord don't look at my sins for they are many hide my iniquities create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me you can see how we can sing these cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then then so Lord deliver me here is Satan he's accusing he's accusing he's accusing and and it's just coming down upon us Lord deliver me deliver me make a clean heart in me Lord help me restore that Joy of my salvation I Lord I want to know that I'm saved and re and Lord let me have that joy that I once had and here's David saying that and he said once Lord then once I received that strength and I understand that no I have been been forgiven now look at how the stakes are raised here and he says then will I teach transgressors th transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee oh how wonderful Lord if you'll just show me if you can just help me with with my transgressions and then help me to receive this Victory then I'm not just going to stand up and jump up and down well I might for a little while but then there's something for me to do now I'm going to help somebody else who's struggling with it because I've been through it I'm going to help somebody and that's that high priest he has been through it verse number three back to Hebrews and by reason hereof he ought speaking of the high priest and by reason here of he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins what he's saying is this high priest he wasn't perfect so how could I if I am that high priest how could I go and make an atonement for you if I have sin in my life I can't so the first thing that this high priest has to do is he has to go and make a sacrifice for his own sins because because he's a sinner I don't care if he's a preacher I don't care if he's the high priest he's got sin in his life so he has to go and he has to make atonement for his own sin kill the lamb and then he can go and he can make an atonement for someone else and no man taketh this honor unto himself but he that is called of God as was Aaron so even this high priest like Aaron he was chosen by God to be in that position and he's not there by his own choosing it's an election for this Minister this priest to be in that position and with that Authority and with that relationship with God so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he that said unto him Thou Art my son today I have begotten thee as he saith also in another the place thou art a priest after the order of MDC the author mentions this is the first time he mentions this mysterious man melchisedek and we're going to get to that in future chapters but he's planting the seed right here this is kind of for foreshadow foreshadowing who in the days of his flesh when he speaking now of Jesus who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with a strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared other translation says that he was heard because of his reverence Jesus Christ was heard in his prayers because of his reverence because of his sincerity uh we could stay for a long time on that how Jesus Jus himself the reason that God heard him the reason that God bent down his ear wasn't because he had the title of the Messiah it wasn't because of of any of these other things the reason that God heard him right here the author is saying is because of the reverence of Jesus Christ so how should we follow in his footsteps how much should we Revere God and approach him in a reverent way because even the son of God says that he was heard because he had that sincerity he had that respect though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him I don't need to expound on that let me read it again though he were a son yet he let yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect speaking of Jesus and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him wow that's beautiful that's our savior that's right called of God a high priest after the order of MDC of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing seeing you are D all dull of hearing now the end of this chapter is going to end with a rebuke of all of us and I think we need it I think that part of the Gospel when Jesus preached much of his ministry was of was correction yes it was salvation but we forget that Jesus warned us that if you don't do things you're going to go to hell he warned us that if you don't live right then you're going to suffer and he said things like come on to me all ye that are burdened and heavy laden and I will give you rest he said those things but he also brought us correction and he he brought us um really not the law but he brought us a magnified law where before the Bible says Thou shalt not commit adultery so here Jesus is one of the ten commandments so Jesus comes and he says oh yeah don't commit adultery he said but if you look at a woman and you want to have a relation with her then you are guilty Jesus raised the bar it says that he said Thou shalt not murder and then Jesus comes back and he says if you just hate a Man Without a Cause And if you are just tearing his character down then you are guilty of murder so Jesus raised this law up and he brought correction and the author of this book of Hebrews here in every chapter you'll notice there is a bit of correction and he said that he says of whom many and speaking of Jesus in mzc he says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing it you are dull of hearing you're not listening for when for the for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat he's telling them that you should be a lot further along than you are now look at me when I read this and I hope that each one of us each one of us are looking at ourselves saying we should be a lot further along than we are for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are full of age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil you're always in the word you're always praying you're always ready and and if you're always ready to do something for God to follow God's um Commandments let's go back brother Jordan if you start with verse 11 and I'm going to read the Amplified version as I said before the Amplified it adds some words in there that aren't in the original context but they're uh they're they help to understand it says this concerning this we have much to say and it is hard to explain since you have become dull and sluggish in your your spiritual hearing and disinclined to listen for though by this time you ought to be teachers because of the time that you have had to learn these truths you actually need someone to teach you again the elementary principles of God's word from the beginning and you have to come you have come to be continually in need of milk and not solid food for everyone who love lives on milk is doctrinally inexperienced and unskilled in the word of righteousness since he is a spiritual infant but solid food for the spiritually mature whose senses are trained by practice to distinguish between what is morally good and what is evil unless we have the close of Hebrews chapter 5 but here's the man here's the book of Hebrews saying you should be teaching these things seeing that you've come so far but you're claiming these things but you're still not there yet you're still living this this life and and you're not you're not excited about it it's it's not a center part of your life you should be eating meat you should be teaching and not just drinking milk and we'll close I uh I do at the musicians could come I do love I like our uh Sunday night Wednesday night meetings because I feel like I can just relax and and talk with people that that I know I love and I know that love me and brothers and sisters one thing I can say and as I was sitting in the back and just Lord what should I say should I say this should I not say that and one thing that came to my mind is that I want to say is after saying those things I know that I'm preaching to the choir I know that you all are strong in those things I know that you love the Lord Jesus I I know that and I know that you put him first but remember in all of these things don't just take part of it take take the whole thing believe in the Lord and and be strong in the Lord because he's good and he loves us brother Michael [Music] you ask me why I'm happy so I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone and when I meet the scers and ask me where they

this evening I'm thinking about this group of people that you've given given me you've given me to them I'm thinking about this day and this time that we're living in and I think about the great presidential debate that they had the other night so where these two men went in front of the entire world to give an account for their actions and for their views and in listening to that I thought what would I do if I was placed on the center stage in front of the whole world and I had to give an account for you and I had to give some words and I was given brief time a brief period of time to say something on your behalf and the great debate was on oh Father I think about this group that you've given me what would they say what would we say if we were given just a few minutes to speak on your behalf and I think would I show up to that great debate with a semi full of books of Revelations and famous writings of Doctrine would I show up with with all of that written material of all these doctrines and religions that were given down through the history father I think about that and I think when it's my turn and a question is presented to me would I pull out these pile of books and quickly go through them to give an answer or would I simply just hold up the blood soaked Banner soaked and dripping in blood father and on that Banner it says Jesus Christ of Nazareth he is my healer he is my savior and he is my king and that is the only answer that I could give here today to these questions that are presented let us be a group of people father that would just hold up that Banner father let us just hold up the word let us hold up the blood of Jesus when anybody asks us to give an account of anything father let us go forward from this day in ever knowing that you are our peace and you are our refuge Refuge you are our healer you've given us a great day to have one more chance to Proclaim your word and your name and to Proclaim that blood of healing over oursel and over our brothers and sisters father for there's no greater thing than what anybody could do on this Earth than to pray and to stand on behalf of their brothers and sisters father and Proclaim your Holy Name father Amen Let us be that group of people father who will come forward with that word father with that Revelation and with that testimony when when asked about us we will simply present the words of Jesus to the people father let us be that group I thank you for this blessed day I ask you to bless everybody as they go here today bless my my beautiful brother Jonathan father and be with
