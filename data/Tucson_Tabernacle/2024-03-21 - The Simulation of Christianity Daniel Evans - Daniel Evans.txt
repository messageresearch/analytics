in your Bibles to Second Corinthians chapter 5. as you're turning appreciate the songs from Sister Cheryl sister Jessica they were definitely In The Same Spirit about speaking the name of Jesus it's

Corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 says this For the Love of Christ constrainteth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and he and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth no we no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new uh words from the Apostle Paul you can be seated it's good to see everyone I am appreciate I do again I appreciate the songs appreciate sisters using the talent that they have to glorify our lord Jesus and song and it's a Ministry and it certainly blesses us how we can just we can feel that spirit coming and I believe that it does it does uh has an effect on us I want to welcome our visitors Brother David you have somebody with you there sister Sharon is it sister Sharon raise your hand all the way from Kenya right God bless you [Applause] it's good to have you um brother Michael my friend contractor Builder God's Builder good to have you

brother Tony you got a special lady with you here this is your mom sister God bless you welcome I'll tell you I appreciate your boy he's got a he's got a nice spirit about him and maybe when I first met him I thought wow he's a that brother he's sincere I can tell he loves the Lord I assume it's because he's got a good Mama right God bless you Sister well welcome it's good it's good to have you in service I am had some on my heart this week to uh well it's over the past couple weeks to minister on and it comes from and uh I'll tell them about it maybe at the end of service it's about a dream I had about 30 years ago more than 30 years ago and and um it uh it really became real to me a couple years ago and it has to do with something that Daniel and I had the honor of doing um you know most of you know Brother David fontener he's a tremendous brother he and sister Sharon they do so much for the Lord they do so much for the young people what Brother David knows he knows I like airplanes and Brother David is an F-16 fighter pilot he's uh he's in the Air Force and he's an instructor and and he he texts me and he says hey he says I've got some time in this F-16 simulator he said would you and Daniel want to come and I was like yeah that's like a dream so as I said I've always loved airplanes and jets and stuff so Daniel and I went out to the base and brother Davis sat us in his simulators and the simulator it's it's an actual it's an exact replica of a cockpit of an ex F-16 fighter jet and so it's got all the controls it's got all all of the displays up there and then around you is a is a screen that that you can see and it looks like it looks like the sky it looks like the ground it's just an exact simulation of when you're flying in this fighter jet So Daniel and I of course we get in there and and Brother David he teaches us the the different controls and stuff and you know I think I can do this okay so so he says okay take off and he tells me how to take off and then he goes over to Daniel and tells him to how to take off and so I I followed your directions I immediately crashed into the into the end of the runway because I couldn't get the flaps down and and the nose up and all that so the the uh the simulator had Grace on me so it eventually got me up in the air and I'm flying around then Brother David goes from Daniel's simulator and he comes over into mine and he says okay do this and and do that and have this control and here's the afterburner and here's here's the propulsion and here's the here here's the the he's using these different technical terms on how you fly the jet and and I'm flying and I'm feeling pretty good about myself and he says okay now go down into the mountains around Tucson and we're flying over Tucson and I mean you could see our houses over over in the on the simulator and you know I'm looking around and and I'm flying I'm putting my nose down and I can see the ground and and up and I'm flying so I go down into the mountains over in the Tucson mountains and I'm flying around the the the the valleys and and stuff and and I was just trying not to crash and uh and I got what I thought was pretty good I I didn't Daniel's over there doing the same thing and uh then Brother David he he puts us into a combat scenario and here come these these hostile airplanes and they're these big giant jumbo jets flying really slow you know and and and we're flying around we're trying to get in behind them and shoot them with the guns and and uh and it's just a great time and as I was flying as I was in that cockpit Brother David would come over and he'd put his hand over mine and he'd say okay do this and do that and and pull up and and down and then he then we were able to uh it was a couple hours running buddy and then we were able to finally land the jet and um he told us how to approach the runway in that and it made me think of this experience I had when I was a young man this dream that I had and uh I was thinking that this simulator it's not real it's a video game it's it's probably cost Millions upon millions of dollars but you're not actually in a jet you're just you're just flying around on on this simulation and they make it as real as they can but it's still not real and my thought as always goes to the Lord and I and I'm thinking about Lord how many men and women that call themselves Christians today brother Glenn sister did not didn't see you back there God bless you it's good it's good to see you how many Christian men and women today that claim to be Christian are just flying around in a simulation that they think is Christianity but it's not they're they're in a they're in something faster in just a big video game and I was this past week we've a lot of things have happened with with the people in the past week and and still some people have been on my heart that I would like to pull and and come to church and try to try to get them to enjoy the spirit around around church and and I've been just reaching out to different people and there's there's many times that I'm I'm getting a a love you Dan or or brother Daniel or however my relationship with with them is I love you but I don't want that and they don't have to have this church it's not this church that that matters but it's that that they have that relationship with the Lord that matters they don't have to come they don't have to come here but they have to find Christ that's the only way that you can come is that if you find Christ otherwise it's just a similar it's a simulation of Christianity and that's the title of my sermon today is the simulation of Christianity and so often I think it's it's actually not most but it seems like today it's almost every person that claims Christianity are they really finding Christ are they really a Christian or is it just flying around in a simulator and it's it's been on my heart and talking with certain people and it's it's like well I don't want to if I go to that church and they're thinking in their mind if I go to that church then I'm going to have to give up certain parts of my life and they say not directly but they say they know that if they start going to a certain church then they will have to give up certain things that are in their life those things are more important than Christ and they would never say that so often we want to say the Lord is my savior and he is and how much I love Jesus and oh I'm all about Jesus and Jesus he saved me from my sins and I know that if I sin he's going to save me and he is but that will make him their savior but they will not make him their lord he is Lord and savior Lord is ruler every part of our lives should be ruled by Jesus Christ not ruled by the church not ruled by church doctrine heaven forbid not not that but ruled by the holy spirit of God which is Jesus Christ in spirit form dwelling in the human being yet they'll claim as a him as Savior but not as Lord because I'd have to give up too much and if they really had him as Lord if this was really important to them it wouldn't be I have to give up anything you would just start loving the Lord and those things they just fall off let's read a scripture first John chapter 2. it's a scripture that's common to us but we need to it needs to come to our mind all the time first John 2 verse 15. first John says this love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him what does that mean does it mean that we love our lives more than we love God for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father The Pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever he that does the will of God is with God forever as I said they're fine with calling Jesus their Savior and giving glory to God for bringing them out of some sort of sin or some sort of problem or losing a job and getting a new job or or falling into into sin and being delivered they're fine with giving Jesus the credit for that but they don't want to make him their ruler every day it's just too much and I say to those people and to myself are you just flying around in a simulator are you just playing a video game or is this real to you are you willing to do anything for the Lord Jesus Christ not because you have to but because you love him because you love him more than you love your life you love him more than you love your wealth you love him more than you love your job you love him more than you love your Styles and your fashion you love him more than you love your vacations you love him more than you love everything you love Jesus more than anything will you put him first I it's with with these some of these people though they'll raise up in the faith that that many of us or most of us have been raised in and for some of the visitors I'm going to quote a man named named William Branham who was a he was a a prophet of God a great man that revolutionized the Christian Church way back in the 1950s and and showed people that Jesus Christ is alive and he's he's done he's powerful and he's not a God that's dead and he's a God that does Miracles and he is a God that stays with his word and many times you'll see people they'll they'll leave a church or they'll leave their their way of thinking and the reason is because it wasn't real in the first place it was a simulator as I say many times it was simply a book of rules and it didn't hold fast it didn't it didn't take they didn't see that Christ is in his word and I I was a we talk about modesty in church and we talk about how important it is for us men and women to look like Christians in every aspect of of Our Lives I was with um you all saw many of you saw my nephews that came out Joel and Benjamin my brother Adam's Sons um Daniel and Joel and Benjamin and another young brother we met for lunch in my office and uh we went out to lunch we just walked from my office my office is over on campus at the University and we we went out and I said well you guys just park in the lot here come up to my office and and then we'll go and uh we'll go eat on campus and I thought it'd be good you know these these these kids are young they'll enjoy going on the University of Arizona campus and it'll be a good experience for them so we get out there and we walk from my office and we walk down campus and I was so embarrassed by the way that almost all nine out of ten of these young women were dressed I was like feeling so bad and we're walking down and and these girls are walking along and the boys are behind me and and I was like oh man I I feel bad they're wearing clothes that they shouldn't wear in front of their mama so we're going along and and we go to eat and we come back and I I pray and it's like Lord wow I didn't I didn't know it was that bad and we talk so much about in our circles we talk so much about a a woman's dress and let me tell you something with the woman's dress the thing that bothers me so much is that you see the people leave and some of these people that I'm I'm witnessing to you see the people leave and they and the first thing they say is oh you left the message she put on a pair of pants what a shame what an absolute shame that our message the thing that we believe has been lowered and degraded to a dress code what a shame let me tell you God sent a messenger to preach the gospel and that gospel was Jesus Christ is alive today and he is and we have ruined it by making it a little thing like a dress code shame shame on the ministers over all these years for doing that but I want to approach things of course with a balance and my point to these other these people that have left wait a minute the Bible still says First Timothy 2 9 a woman shall Adorn herself in modest apparel the word still says that you can't change it well I don't really I don't really want to uh I don't want to do that so and and well if you don't want to follow that part of of the word then do you want to follow the part about baptism do you want to put follow the part about salvation do you want to follow the part about giving your heart still to the Lord what part do you want to follow and what part do you not want to follow you're playing a video game so these these women walking around the thought came to me take one of these women that we saw on campus at the University take one of them pull them out stick them over here on Oracle Road say walk down the road and see how many men stop to pick him up as a prostitute that's how we should be thinking how am I presenting myself to the public how am I presenting myself to a man is it that if you picked me up and set me out there on Orca road that the men would be stopping to pick me up as a prostitute there's something wrong that's never been the case I don't believe until today that we have gotten so low that we look it's just normal the vast majority look like that and you know me I am not someone that preaches a book of rules in a legalistic Doctrine but the facts are the facts take one and put them on the road see what happens 9 out of ten of them but it is it's it's sad to me that that our message has just become a dress code no no if you want to please the Lord Jesus then you are going to please him you are going to do whatever it takes not because I set a rule how long your skirt should be ridiculous but because the holy spirit is guiding you brother is guiding you sister in everything that you do I get criticized on one end I get criticized you need to preach you need to preach about these girls wearing those clothes you need to get them how dare you I preached Jesus Christ let them come to him and then there's the other side that says you need to preach that it's okay to do whatever you want and just accept Jesus how dare you the word is the word but if you have that relationship with Christ then then you're not in a simulator anymore you're not in a fake religion you're following Christ so I was a little bit um sometimes you know you get ticked off and you shouldn't we shouldn't so so I get on I get on the table and I start searching brother Brown's message like okay how many times did he really say pants so I started I've read every single quote my brother Brown talked about pants 1200 sermons 1206 1207 whatever it is three he talked about a woman wearing pants now there's there's other ones that he used other words but I was taken back by the quote that kept coming up this should be the message this should should be what we are preaching in message churches let me read you read to you this quote from God's provided way this quote kept coming up over and over and let me tell you what the message is you don't judge a man you don't judge a man by the callous in his hand but by the bags in the knees of his pants where he's been praying Hallelujah that's what we need today some more men like that got real Godly old-fashioned Holy Ghost conviction I'd rather have a man like that with my boy if he didn't know even his ABCs to stand out there by a stump somewhere in a broom sage and pray for him till he come through with the Holy Ghost than to have all the teachers there is in the world trying to poke theology in him amen brother that's the truth what we need today is to get back to God's provided way for Sinners friends that provided way for Sinners is to meet Jesus Christ to understand him to to have a relationship with Christ and then he will correct our heirs not to have a weak pulpit not to have a jellyfish up here preaching to you that won't stand up for anything no not to have that to have someone that preaches this word but will also stand up against the the dogmas that we have created over the years that's right also we when it the more that we get closer to Christ the more that we give our hearts over to him the more that we see that many of these doctrines that we've had over the years that we've accepted over the years you know what they're not they're not right we've taken a quote here and a quote there and a quote over here and put them all together and now it's message theology and instead we ignore what every sermon whatever thing that was preached was about which is about Christ which is about that relationship with Christ which is about receiving the Holy Spirit then once you receive that Spirit now you have something I've heard people saying oh well if you get them to Christ then they will come to the message of brother Branham no no no no no no no that is you got it backwards everything is to get to Christ brother branham's message I'll tell you will help you get there I promise it was the truth it is the truth it's beautiful but it will help you get to Christ not the other way around you don't put somebody's message over the Lord Jesus every prophet in this Bible was pointing us to Christ that is where we need to go is the Lord Jesus and it will bring Holiness it will it will bring pureness and uh then I was reading I was thinking about this sermon in Isaiah 64. it says this Isaiah 64. 6 many of us have probably quoted this it says but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags and we all do and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away and there is none that called upon the name that stirth up himself to take hold of thee for thou has hid thy face from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities but now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father we are the clay Thou Art our Potter and we are the work of thy hand and I see that the Pharisees and Sadducees I talk about them a lot I see that they're righteous deeds and how they preached a legalistic Doctrine and they live this legalistic way and God looks down at him says it's a stink in my nose it's filthy rags before me but then I see someone else come in and bow down and wash his feet he looks over here he sees the Pharisees it says Your Righteous Deeds are filthy rags to me but this little lady over here this righteous deed that she did it's a blessing it comes up before me as a sweet smelling savor why because we think that maybe our way of living our righteous Deeds make us righteous they don't Christ makes us righteous Jesus is the one he is he is the one that makes us to serve him doesn't make us serve him but He blesses us by serving him I am with Christ and and and with the these these people and I looked and and as I said I was looking at these these girls out on campus at the U of A I was like man this is this is rough this world and I go outside and and I see that all of the drug addicts and and all that are out there and I see the thing that troubles me the most is really the church goer is really the one that says well I'll take the Lord's word as long as it fits my lifestyle and if it doesn't fit my lifestyle whatever that lifestyle is friends if it doesn't fit my lifestyle then I think I'll go to another church that teaches more along my way of thinking it should not be your way of thinking it shouldn't be my way of thinking it should be Christ's way of thinking and we should get into his program whatever that program is and we should be able to surrender ourselves to the Lord and give our hearts to him give our lives to him and then he would lead us and he would put that Holiness in there and and as these some of these people have been on my heart and I and I've said that they've left because they didn't want to maybe look this way or dress that way and it's because it was taught wrong it's not that it's Christ in you as that that's for scripture that I read but there's still you don't throw out the word the word is still there and everything that Holy Spirit when you receive that Holy Spirit it will align with his word but the first thing the first thing is we need to make a commitment we need to make our lives do our best to match up to what Christ teaches Matthew chapter 15 said that Jesus says they honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me how many how many in this room now is that true for talk about the Lord and how good the Lord is and how much I love the Lord and and and how I and how I do this for him and and how I come to church and I and but inside I want something else and if the preacher says something that disagrees with my theology I'll just go to another church and I was thinking about some of these I was praying for him last night and I was thinking that's Lord they don't have to come to our church they don't have to come to our way of thinking but will they find Christ if they find Christ somewhere else God bless them they found Christ we talk about there's different ages and and ages change times change God doesn't change he's he's God and he changes not but but people change and God loves the people so much that he will make ways in different ages to help us and we see that I was talking with somebody yesterday that from a pre from a from an earlier generation than mine and saying that that the lord gave you away in your generation and it wasn't like the previous generation before you when I when I was growing up I have a different desire on my heart and and I like different things it's it's my generation and God provides for me and we look now and we Face a generation of of people that have come up differently they've been raised differently some of the kids we would consider maybe brats it's like man a kid would never act like that when I was a kid I remember in school that the principal or the teacher would spank the tar out of you in school you remember that I remember I remember sitting in class and this kid uh Brian petticord he he's this little kid and he came he came back to class he was out of class for a little bit he came to class and his eyes were red and he was still crying I was like what happened man well I got principal spanked me what'd you do I don't even remember what he did but he got spanked that was my generation but this new generation you can't do that I'm not saying that that was right I'm saying it was a different generation so God now provides for this new generation he provides he provides for them and you see the the direction I'm trying to go they need time the kids need they need to be together that's why I'm building these rooms out there they have to have that and you might say well they just need the word and they just need services and they just need somebody preaching them it's not going to work that may have worked for the generation before me but it doesn't work for this generation yet God is still God and he still meets he still meets our needs he still takes care of us he still provides for us I was and if we truly are not in that simulator it should draw people to us not say I don't want to be like them and that's how it is so often well that church I don't want to be like them they're rude to me and they're this way and that way Christ says draw if I would be lifted up I would draw all men to me and we have that Spirit we draw those people in not being weak you don't draw somebody in by being weak you draw someone in by having love and I was a few years I don't know five years ago or so I got a call when I was in the ministry in Jeffersonville I got a call from a lady in Georgia and we were talking about dress and we um just now I was talking about how important it is that we represent ourselves as a Christian and not somebody that would be picked up on Oracle Road well this lady calls and she says I don't know who they were she says but I walked into McDonald's and there were three women in there and she said they were dressed so nice they look so pretty and she said they just had such a spirit about them and she said I just want to be able to get in touch with them they gave me this track and has your phone number on the back and I said well sister I could uh let me let me see where are you at and she's told me what town she was in Georgia she says I was in McDonald's and she said there was something about these three women she was that I wanted to be like she said sir she said I could tell that they knew God that they knew Jesus and I wanted to have what they had and I said I said well that's that's quite a testimony that lady and her husband and her family she gave her heart to the Lord not because of church not because of a Doctrine but because of the spirit that those women had and the love that they presented to this lady they weren't flying in a video game those sisters were flying a jet fighter they were doing it right when I was when I was young I was 19 years old I had a dream and I won't go through the whole dream I'm just going to give you just the very first part of it and it shook me up so bad that it was it was coming to the close I was I was up in Phoenix and I was playing ball up there I was going to college it shook me up so bad that I ended my baseball career I wanted to just come home I wanted to change my life because of this dream it shook me up that bad what it was I dreamed that I was with a friend of mine who was a a good he was a good person love the Lord and we were we had gone on to another place that was not this world and it was a beautiful place and we were walking along these wooden sidewalks and the place was just gorgeous and I was I and I was looking around and and my I asked my friend I said are we in heaven and my friend said yeah he says we're in heaven ah it's beautiful this is one and I was just I was so happy and as we were walking along out comes this this young lady and she's in this long skirt long hair she she walks she walks by us in front of us and we're walking along the sidewalk and she stumbles a little bit and she said oh and then she said a four-letter word not a bad four-letter word a four-letter word that probably many people you shouldn't be but many people in this congregation might say not something that is cussing but not appropriate for me to say at the pulpit I'll tell you out there if you want to know but she said a word that was not necessarily acceptable and I looked and I said oh no and my friend immediately didn't notice and he said yep we're in heaven I said no we are not so the dream goes on law very symbolic very spiritual dream that I know came from God and I will say this for 30 years I didn't think about that dream often I thought about that dream every day of my life for 30 years and what it was is I was in a place that I thought I was right but I was right on the gates of hell living a good life I was right there ready to go and I didn't know it it was a simulation of Christianity I was going along and it was something that wasn't real and I thought about that my whole life until the Lord finally revealed to me what it was and it's been since that time I was a couple years ago that the Lord showed me what it was and since that time it's been one of the greatest blessings that I've ever had in knowing what it meant and knowing that God had my life in his hand this whole time but he showed me that you are not going down the right Road even with all of your religion with all of your church with all of your legalism with all of that it doesn't matter unless you know the true Jesus Christ it's a simulation of Christianity if you don't know him personally I just preached on you have to have a testimony if you don't know Christ and you are not sure then you could be walking on the same road that I was walking on same age as many of you young people but thank God he gave me that and I always thought Lord why did you why did you give me this dream if my my destination was just going to be hell but my destination wasn't hell he was warning me be careful no Christ it's not about a church it's not about what your pastor thinks it's not about what the priest says it's about do you know the Lord Jesus I was in that simulator me and Daniel are going having so much fun you know crashed a couple times what if Brother David would have picked me up and said okay take me out to the runway and set me in the cockpit of a real F-16 . I said all right take off I'd be like well it will no maybe that was fun the video game was fun but I don't really I don't really think that I want to do that because now my life is on the line and it's the same thing with so many so-called Christians today yeah well we got a good pastor yeah we got a good church yeah I I I um I read my Bible sometimes and I pray sometimes and everything's all good but wait a minute I don't know if I want to sit in that cockpit same thing happened in the book of Exodus when they came up to the mountain Moses the prophet was so excited and he's like you're gonna meet God today get ready sanctify yourselves because you're gonna meet God and then they go up and they see the thundering and the lightning and they see the pillar of fire there and they're like wait a minute we'll just take a man because if God speaks then we'll die so we'll just we'll just take what a man says and we'll just we'll just we'll just believe what that man says that man was Moses that was a grave mistake so what does God say the Eternal God he says okay from now on if that's what you want if you don't want to talk to me I'll send you I'll send you a prophet I'll speak through him or maybe I'll send you a pastor and I'll speak to him I was speaking good I'll give you good parents and I'll speak to them because Lord I don't know if I really want to step into a complete sanctification a complete separation from the world I don't know if I really want to do that so I'll just go through the motions and and the Lord can be my savior but he's not going to be my ruler how many how many of us think that way how many of us know it is right to do something or to not do something and yet we forsake it just because we want our way rather than God's way how many I'll close if the musicians could come I want to close with a chapter I read a lot because it means so much to me it's it's in the Book of John and it's it's Jesus and it's the last recorded prayer that we have of the Lord Jesus in The Book of John and Jesus didn't want us to be flying around in a simulator or playing a video game that simulator is good when we're raising our kids it's good don't do this do this don't do that don't do this that simulator gets us to where we can maybe fly the jet in the future but it's still a video game it's still not real but let me read to you the ultimate pilot what he said in John chapter 17 the Lord is praying for his disciples and he's praying for all of us too this is right before he goes to the Garden of the Gethsemane right before he is taken to the cross John chapter 17 verse 16. Jesus praying to the father they are not of the world [Music] even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world pretty soon [Music] the day of Pentecost was going to come and they were going to sit in that fighter jet that engine was going to come on those afterburners were going to go and they were going to leave that Runway filled with the Holy Spirit listen to this our lord Jesus saying this and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also maybe might be Sanctified through the truth the Lord Jesus it could have been anything that he wanted he was a man he was God made flesh he could have made any choice any career anything he wanted to do he was given free moral agency as we are and he said this I sanctify myself sister Jessica your song it wasn't for us it was for other people the reason I lived the life that I live is for other people like these sisters that were in McDonald's living a Sanctified life living a life that that was above reproach and kindness and gentleness and love not not not condemning and and and preaching and and getting on people but living a life that was full of love and it brought someone to the Lord Jesus because that woman saw something real [Music] saw somebody that wasn't just playing a video game that was actually flying a fighter jet Jesus says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee that they also maybe won that the world may believe that thou has sent me why do we live do we do our best to live a holy life why do we why do we pray say Lord I want to live my life pleasing to you why do we why do we do that the real relationship with Christ is not through the organization or the organization's way of thinking where you have to talk like this and dress like that but the individual relationship with Christ is where it's at and that's when he speaks to us that's when it grabs a hold we can put our kids in the simulator and it's good teach them get them get them to where they understand the word flying around and that it made me learn the learn the um the levers and the gauges but when I said I'd asked Brother David I said what's the difference between the simulation and the real thing and he says he says he says they're exactly the same he said but but when you're actually flying he says you can feel the airplane beneath you you can feel it Flex he says you can feel the wind speed he says you can feel all of these these different things that aren't in the simulator you have to look at the gauges in the simulator but when you're actually in the jet you can feel the stuff it's real and if we are not there then friends ask yourself Lord am I in a simulation that dream let me tell you if there's anything that's been in my life that's from God it was then it shook me up as a 19 year old boy it started the changing of my life and and as the years went by it's I struggled with it and I had many different interpretations of it I said oh this must be that that must be this and then boom I saw it and it it was I was in a simulation because it wasn't real [Music] and I was standing I was standing right there at the edge and the Lord came in and saved me right before I was lost don't take don't take something that's that's not real friends it may be it may be all have all the the look of something real but if you're not really in the jet if you're not really taking off then it's just a simulation of Christianity don't let it be that you keep going we're going to hear testimonies tonight I want to hear testimonies of how your candle got lit I want to hear testimonies of this is how it became real to me and make sure as we give testimonies tonight sing songs of praise make sure it is real to you because people are watching and if I'm claiming to be a Christian if I'm claiming to be a believer if I'm claiming these things and I don't have the life to back it up what good is it going to do it's not about me as Jesus said I Sanctified myself for what so I can go to heaven Jesus said I sanctify myself for them and if you have the same Spirit of Christ that Jesus had [Music] then you will be the same way Lord I do my best not for myself or do you save me I do my I do my best for them that's why I live my life that's what I do what I do for other people and that's the life of a Christian it's a life I want to live there's um food after

witnessing the biggest hindrance to the church is a hip to the church is a hypocrite that doesn't live the life behind what they're saying that's what hinders us follow follow the lord live that consecrated life whatever he requires do it one of the things that he requires [Music] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus something that Jesus said he said go out and make disciples Make Disciples of what of your church Make Disciples of me of Christ teach them about me Make Disciples of them baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost baptized them lead them to the Lord the disciples took that commandment seriously Matthew 28 19. they took it seriously first thing first thing they did after they received that same Spirit of Christ Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name Jesus Christ Peter with the revelation Father the Son and the Holy Spirit their God [Music] and God has a name associated with him and that name is Jesus he ascended up to the right hand of the father [Music] if you have a need to be baptized if you would like to be baptized it'd be a good time today to do it brother sister Stephanie brother Tony we have

people I love it when someone makes a decision and as I talked about just now that that Jesus commanded us to be baptized Peter's told us that we are baptized for the removing for the taking away of our sins for the remission of sins as it says in the Bible and I really appreciate it when someone comes and when someone is prepared and when someone has thought it out even as a Young Man it's young Maddox he drew a picture and you can't see it very well obviously it's far away but it's a it's a beautiful mountain scene and it's a river running through there and there's a gravestone there and it looks like a fresh grave it's near this tree and it says said old sins it says old sins on the gravestone I think the young man has a good understanding of what baptism is for he wrote this he said he knew I was going to ask him this and he says what baptism means to me is it means that you are leaving your sins behind and you're letting Christ into your life you bring the Holy Spirit into you and with you when you let Christ into your life that's basically starting a new life with Christ in that new life that is starting a new Christ yeah I would say we should clap for that [Applause] in front of all of these people and by your own testimony you're coming into these Waters to tell everyone I am now a Christian and my sins are washed away in the blood of Jesus Christ you believe that raise your hand you believe it if you do raise your hand yeah brother Maddox if you you can hold your nose or you and you can grab my hand right here I'll put you down under the water it is a great honor this young man who has more of an understanding of baptism than probably many Through the Ages that have ever been baptized problematics I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] unless this young man father may your Holy Spirit go before him May the spirit guide him and protect him father may he if you would tarry may he lead souls to you in Jesus Christ's name [Applause] thank you foreign [Music] come here he just told me he says I was baptized when I was young and I really didn't know what it meant I'm going to let you speak God bless you all uh so I was yeah I was baptized as a baby um and you know we started coming back to church here here recently and and I just want to get baptized to recommute that that walk with Jesus and to not be in the stimulator I want to be in the cockpit that's good Tony the Bible teaches us that we in Romans I believe is chapter six that we go down into this water and it represents the grave and we come out a resurrected being a new being with our sins washed away in the blood of Jesus Christ feel good about it you stand right here got a hold of my hand there and one more step this way my friend fellow servant of the Lord Jesus father husband melatonia we pray that the Lord guide you in his ways always and I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] looks like there's an angel walking into the baptismal pool right now friends doesn't it feel good doesn't it feel good to see there's there's this thing called repentance and that repents is it's the Bible says that we are cut in our heart and we want to make all things right we want to make sure that everything is real and according to his word sister hope he made this decision to be baptized give me a little testimony why I got baptized when I was young but I I didn't truly understand everything and I I've been feeling for a couple years and I needed to get baptized again never leave anything undone brothers and sisters always be
