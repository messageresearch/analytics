[1:10:38] myself also
[1:10:40] that weekend will be the weekend of the
[1:10:42] 25th
[1:10:43] and so that weekend i'd like to
[1:10:47] start i've already we have some things
[1:10:49] in motion i'll announce tonight
[1:10:51] don't have all of the details yet but
[1:10:53] we'd like to start our children's
[1:10:55] sunday school that sunday
[1:10:59] and so that's sunday the 25th we're
[1:11:02] going to have
[1:11:03] this is this is not the full
[1:11:04] announcement you'll get you'll get the
[1:11:06] full one coming once we structure it
[1:11:08] how we want but we're going to have two
[1:11:10] groups
[1:11:11] we're going to have a junior class and a
[1:11:13] senior class the junior class will be
[1:11:15] ages
[1:11:16] 4 to 9 years old and then the
[1:11:19] the senior class will be ages 10 to 16
[1:11:23] years old now
[1:11:24] if you have any reservations or anybody
[1:11:27] listening by way of archive or online
[1:11:29] you have any reservations about sending
[1:11:31] your kids to sunday school with covid
[1:11:32] and
[1:11:33] that's completely understandable so we
[1:11:35] understand that
[1:11:36] we we want to go ahead and have it felt
[1:11:38] led to do this
[1:11:39] and so i just was looking to this
[1:11:41] weekend would be a good time
[1:11:43] so the 25th lord willing hold that in
[1:11:45] prayer lord will and we're going to do
[1:11:46] that
[1:11:47] that'll be ages 4 to 9 and ages 10 to
[1:11:51] 16.
[1:11:52] i'm going to have two groups and i know
[1:11:54] i'm gonna get a lot of questions about
[1:11:55] what time
[1:11:56] i don't know all those details yet i can
[1:11:58] tell you that
[1:12:00] i would like the young people the youth
[1:12:03] the sunday school class
[1:12:04] to be in church i don't like a sunday
[1:12:08] school class where they're
[1:12:09] having sunday school while we're having
[1:12:11] church i believe it's important for kids
[1:12:13] to be in church
[1:12:14] so we can work that out at a very
[1:12:16] minimum
[1:12:17] the class would dismiss before the
[1:12:20] ministering of the word begins
[1:12:22] now what i'd prefer if we could make it
[1:12:25] work would be
[1:12:26] for even them to come even 15 minutes
[1:12:29] before the saw into this get 15 minutes
[1:12:31] of worship
[1:12:32] uh amen and then go into the the sermon
[1:12:35] the
[1:12:36] ministering of the word but we want to
[1:12:37] make sure that happens don't really know
[1:12:39] yet
[1:12:40] um so um still just we're still just
[1:12:42] working out
[1:12:43] some details about that another thing
[1:12:46] that i'm i'm praying about
[1:12:48] uh and so i don't know if this will
[1:12:49] happen that same weekend
[1:12:51] uh but i'm praying about possibly
[1:12:53] starting an adult sunday school class
[1:12:55] like they do like they did in
[1:12:57] jeffersonville for years with brother
[1:12:59] collins
[1:12:59] and at the same time that the children's
[1:13:02] class would happen we'd have an adult
[1:13:04] bible study sunday school class here
[1:13:08] and the sanctuary and so the kids would
[1:13:10] have a class
[1:13:11] and the adults would have a class we do
[1:13:14] that in beaufort and it's been such just
[1:13:16] a blessing
[1:13:17] you take a topic that is not preaching
[1:13:20] at all just teaching as best that you
[1:13:22] can take a real bible topic a real bible
[1:13:25] study
[1:13:25] maybe a question someone would have and
[1:13:27] be a good opportunity
[1:13:29] for that that be okay
[1:13:32] i don't know if we're gonna do that yet
[1:13:33] but just be praying about that that's uh
[1:13:35] just upon my heart
[1:13:37] and so uh so we'll see definitely the
[1:13:39] the kids sunday school class
[1:13:40] if that was the take place we'd do it on
[1:13:42] the same weekend and of course
[1:13:44] the 20 uh 5th
[1:13:48] is what i said is that right is the 25th
[1:13:49] of sunday
[1:13:51] can somebody help me out on that i think
[1:13:53] the 25th is a sunday
[1:13:54] brother jordan i thought you just know
[1:13:56] that off the top of your head
[1:14:00] and so i thought the 25th okay good that
[1:14:02] is good so the 25th we'll start that
[1:14:05] and uh i will teach that first adult
[1:14:07] sunday school class
[1:14:08] if we have it if we go forward with it
[1:14:11] regardless the kids class will begin
[1:14:14] that weekend so be in prayer amen and
[1:14:17] expectation for that
[1:14:18] you love the lord jesus amen i'd like to
[1:14:22] um
[1:14:23] there are some things that we can do
[1:14:25] some things that we can't do
[1:14:26] we want to have wisdom and be careful
[1:14:28] about we're praying about
[1:14:30] young people's services for the for the
[1:14:31] youth uh to have some youth meetings but
[1:14:34] just really
[1:14:35] trying to be um prudent in what we do
[1:14:38] could you turn me back up brothers lost
[1:14:40] the volume don't know why
[1:14:42] up here it sounded great before there we
[1:14:43] go thank you um
[1:14:45] but we're trying to be real prudent
[1:14:47] about what we do
[1:14:48] and just to take caution but we i do
[1:14:51] believe that it's important
[1:14:53] for the family of god young and old to
[1:14:56] uh not be
[1:14:57] separated but to be together amen to
[1:15:00] have unity if anything
[1:15:01] this uh this pandemic has done is it
[1:15:04] separated people
[1:15:06] and uh separated people from church
[1:15:09] and i don't like that i know the lord
[1:15:12] doesn't like that he's got all things in
[1:15:13] control
[1:15:15] but but i just i love to come together i
[1:15:17] love as much as we can do
[1:15:19] as much as possible while remaining
[1:15:22] safe and and prayerful and as we've said
[1:15:26] many times we've just took taken
[1:15:27] everything as best we can
[1:15:29] by prayer and consideration and it's a
[1:15:31] it's a moving target
[1:15:33] you don't just uh make one decision and
[1:15:34] stick with it you sort of have to move
[1:15:36] as
[1:15:37] it moves and so things seem to be
[1:15:40] slowing down
[1:15:41] and uh getting better and opening up
[1:15:43] more and more and more we're thankful
[1:15:45] very grateful for that all right that's
[1:15:47] all the announcements i had
[1:15:49] amen you come to hear the word say amen
[1:15:52] amen uh genesis chapter one we'd like to
[1:15:55] just pick up right where we were
[1:15:56] right where we left off this morning
[1:16:00] so god created this is verse 27 of
[1:16:02] genesis 1.
[1:16:09] so god created man in his own
[1:16:12] image in the image of god
[1:16:15] created he him male and female
[1:16:19] created he them verse 28
[1:16:24] next next verse there brothers and god
[1:16:27] blessed them and god said unto them
[1:16:29] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[1:16:32] the earth and subdue it
[1:16:34] and have dominion over the fish of the
[1:16:36] sea and over the fowl of the air
[1:16:38] and over every living thing that moveth
[1:16:42] upon the earth turn to genesis chapter 2
[1:16:44] we just want to read here
[1:16:46] also in verse 7.
[1:16:52] genesis 2 7 and the lord god formed man
[1:16:55] of the dust of the ground and breathed
[1:16:58] into his nostrils
[1:16:59] the breath of life and man became
[1:17:03] a living soul heavenly father we thank
[1:17:05] you lord for yet again another
[1:17:07] opportunity that we have to serve you
[1:17:10] to be in your service lord lord to do
[1:17:12] something for the kingdom of god for
[1:17:14] your purposes
[1:17:16] we just ask lord that you would sanctify
[1:17:18] our vessels our
[1:17:19] lips lord the words that we'll say are
[1:17:21] thoughts
[1:17:22] and god would you get glory lord in the
[1:17:24] service here tonight
[1:17:26] lord those that are here gathered lord
[1:17:28] with an
[1:17:29] expectation to hear from you lord i pray
[1:17:32] for those that couldn't be here
[1:17:34] those that are online may be listening
[1:17:36] later by archive
[1:17:38] i pray lord the word would just meet
[1:17:39] their expectation we ask
[1:17:42] granted lord to everyone here we ask in
[1:17:44] jesus name
[1:17:45] amen you can be seated
[1:17:52] we said this morning that
[1:17:55] if you notice here in genesis 1 27 the
[1:17:58] bible says that god created
[1:18:00] man in his own image the image of god
[1:18:03] created he
[1:18:07] and so none of the animals we know from
[1:18:09] the bible were created in the image of
[1:18:11] god
[1:18:12] only man something was unique
[1:18:15] different about man about male and
[1:18:18] female
[1:18:19] they would be created in the image of
[1:18:22] god
[1:18:23] and the bible says as we said here that
[1:18:24] he breathes the breath of life
[1:18:27] into this vessel this human that he's
[1:18:30] created in his image
[1:18:32] and we know that the first human here
[1:18:35] the first
[1:18:35] original type this was the seed chapter
[1:18:38] as we said this morning
[1:18:40] the book of beginnings that the this
[1:18:43] first
[1:18:43] man adam the bible says was created a
[1:18:46] living soul
[1:18:47] and god creates him and and forms him
[1:18:51] and he was he was uh brother branham
[1:18:53] says he was just a
[1:18:54] he was perfect he was beautiful his his
[1:18:57] the way that god created him
[1:18:59] and it was was as far as as far as a
[1:19:03] a person he was non-perishable
[1:19:06] there was no disease there was no uh
[1:19:10] very different than the body that you
[1:19:12] live in today in the body that
[1:19:14] you come into the world in as you get
[1:19:16] older you're reminded of
[1:19:18] how much corruption is in your body as
[1:19:20] your body begins to
[1:19:22] fail and if you're if your body doesn't
[1:19:24] fail then your mind will begin to fill
[1:19:27] and and and the body is ever decaying
[1:19:29] it's ever
[1:19:30] in a cycle of a curse it's it's under a
[1:19:33] curse just
[1:19:34] as much as the earth is under a curse
[1:19:36] our bodies live under a constant
[1:19:38] curse uh curse with can be our bodies
[1:19:41] can become
[1:19:41] sick they can age they do age and
[1:19:44] and they can die and so the bible says
[1:19:48] but this man was
[1:19:49] was he wasn't a baby uh god didn't
[1:19:52] create him and
[1:19:53] he came in the form of a babe uh neither
[1:19:56] was he an old man
[1:19:57] elderly in age there was no age but we
[1:20:00] understand that this was prior to time
[1:20:03] so
[1:20:04] time is a bottle brother branham said it
[1:20:06] that way he said time was like a little
[1:20:08] bottle
[1:20:09] uh a a a a a time a body of time a
[1:20:12] beginning
[1:20:13] and an in a segment we measure it
[1:20:16] by literally so we look at it from the
[1:20:19] beginning like a line
[1:20:20] like a linear line but in the beginning
[1:20:24] here
[1:20:24] there was no there was until the curse
[1:20:27] uh this was and he was an eternal
[1:20:29] attribute of god he wasn't a baby
[1:20:32] and adam wasn't an old man but he was
[1:20:36] a young man that's why brother branham
[1:20:37] says that when you
[1:20:39] get your glorified body he says you'll
[1:20:41] be at the prime of life
[1:20:43] and what age is that 18 19 20 something
[1:20:47] like that the prophet thought something
[1:20:48] about that
[1:20:49] he said he looked like they were about
[1:20:51] when he goes beyond the curtain of time
[1:20:53] and he sees people in glorified bodies
[1:20:55] they were he didn't know
[1:20:57] that the ages said it was just they were
[1:20:58] there was just such beauty
[1:21:00] uh such he said it's just just a they
[1:21:03] were in the prime of their life
[1:21:06] and so a god you notice this man
[1:21:09] uh here you have a son the first son
[1:21:12] that this man adam
[1:21:14] and and who was his parent who was his
[1:21:16] father the creator
[1:21:17] it was god jehovah jehovah it was it was
[1:21:20] that eternal attribute that
[1:21:22] elohim who was this self-existing one
[1:21:25] now has expressed himself
[1:21:27] into creation can you say amen tonight
[1:21:30] but a son
[1:21:31] looks like his parent right so it's a
[1:21:34] son looks like his but the father
[1:21:36] doesn't look like the son
[1:21:37] the son you don't say uh to a father boy
[1:21:40] you look a lot like your son no no
[1:21:42] your son looks a lot like you and so a
[1:21:44] son
[1:21:45] is an attribute he came from something
[1:21:48] and the genes are passed down and so
[1:21:51] so the the son looks like his parents
[1:21:53] and he's
[1:21:54] his very being his image is
[1:21:57] in his own father's likeness
[1:22:01] he acts like his father he speaks like
[1:22:04] his father
[1:22:04] he thinks adam didn't have a mind of his
[1:22:07] own
[1:22:08] his mind was synchronous with the
[1:22:10] heavenly father
[1:22:12] and so what what mind is eve you say
[1:22:14] well then what mine does eves have
[1:22:15] brother madam says
[1:22:16] eve had the same mind she she he she
[1:22:19] would say to it
[1:22:20] to a tree uh that tree should be picked
[1:22:22] up and planted over here
[1:22:24] and adam would say that's exactly what i
[1:22:26] was thinking
[1:22:27] because she was in tune in harmony what
[1:22:29] did brother branham say says the bride
[1:22:31] of christ
[1:22:32] has the mind of god is this what the
[1:22:35] prophet said
[1:22:36] she knows what he wants done with his
[1:22:38] word
[1:22:40] and so he's is very being he acts he
[1:22:43] speaks like his father
[1:22:45] adam could do everything he could walk
[1:22:47] on water he could speak
[1:22:48] he could say tree be uprooted and be
[1:22:50] planted over there
[1:22:52] it was natural it came as his first
[1:22:55] nature now we live under a fallen nature
[1:22:57] it doesn't come under our first nature
[1:23:00] our first nature is carnal it's enmity
[1:23:04] the bible calls it with the things of
[1:23:05] god
[1:23:06] the carnal mind is enmity it's like oil
[1:23:10] and water it doesn't mix
[1:23:12] the carnal mind is enmity with god
[1:23:15] come on i need your amens here tonight
[1:23:18] there's a it doesn't it doesn't bible
[1:23:21] says it this way nor can it even know
[1:23:23] the things of god that's why the carnal
[1:23:26] mind an
[1:23:26] unregenerate person who isn't born again
[1:23:28] what did brother branham say about he
[1:23:29] says you send them
[1:23:30] you send them to cemetery what he was
[1:23:33] calling seminary
[1:23:35] and he says and one who's already dead
[1:23:37] then you pump them full with theology
[1:23:39] if they if they've never had the
[1:23:41] experience by the baptism of the holy
[1:23:42] ghost all they can do is pile on
[1:23:44] intellect
[1:23:45] and intellectual knowledge but
[1:23:46] intellectual knowledge produces death
[1:23:50] you know intellectual knowledge of this
[1:23:52] produces death
[1:23:55] learning this the bible says ever
[1:23:57] learning but never able to come to the
[1:23:58] knowledge of the truth
[1:24:00] because the truth is is not a the tr no
[1:24:02] one has rights on the truth because the
[1:24:04] truth is a person
[1:24:07] hello what did pilate say what is truth
[1:24:11] that wasn't the right question the right
[1:24:12] question was who is truth
[1:24:15] because truth wasn't intellect it wasn't
[1:24:17] wasn't you couldn't understand it
[1:24:19] trying to understand the things of god
[1:24:21] uh intellectually that's why the bible
[1:24:23] says
[1:24:24] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[1:24:28] life
[1:24:30] so trying to understand it
[1:24:31] intellectually only produces death
[1:24:34] but with the spirit it produces life can
[1:24:37] you say amen
[1:24:38] and so so adam could his faith it was
[1:24:41] natural it was his first
[1:24:42] nature it's how he acted it's it was his
[1:24:45] first
[1:24:45] reaction his first instinct he had a
[1:24:48] faith
[1:24:49] faith was natural to adam
[1:24:52] it's not very natural to you
[1:24:56] it's not very natural to me you know
[1:24:58] what
[1:24:59] you know what's natural you said brother
[1:25:00] matt but you're born again yeah that's
[1:25:02] right
[1:25:03] i trust you are too now let me speak to
[1:25:06] you that are born again
[1:25:08] do you know what comes natural to you
[1:25:11] doubt not faith
[1:25:15] see but i got the holy ghost that's
[1:25:17] right but you live under in a body
[1:25:19] that is cursed
[1:25:23] hello so so adam's first nature
[1:25:27] faith was natural to adam
[1:25:31] he could speak the word and there was
[1:25:33] never a thought
[1:25:34] of doubt there was never fear the bible
[1:25:37] says in first corinthians 11
[1:25:38] 7 man is the image of the glory of god
[1:25:41] and the glory of god but the woman is
[1:25:42] the glory of the man
[1:25:43] so man is in god's image he's in his
[1:25:46] likeness
[1:25:47] and so therefore he he speaks uh like
[1:25:50] god what did brother branham say
[1:25:51] every seed would produce after its own
[1:25:55] kind
[1:25:56] if dogs dogs will bring forth dogs
[1:25:59] cats will bring forth cats and so if god
[1:26:03] reproduces himself what will god
[1:26:05] reproduce
[1:26:07] likeness the seed of his own a messiah a
[1:26:10] a a a a a an an eternal attribute of his
[1:26:14] father that's what it's what the son is
[1:26:16] he's a reflection
[1:26:17] they now you're not speaking here
[1:26:18] naturally i'm speaking spiritually
[1:26:21] that as a son of god you've been
[1:26:22] translated from this kingdom of darkness
[1:26:25] into the kingdom of his dear son
[1:26:28] you are now seated now in heavenly
[1:26:31] places in christ jesus
[1:26:34] but brother madam in tucson yeah your
[1:26:35] body is but
[1:26:37] spiritually where are you at
[1:26:41] hello and so
[1:26:44] we see that the the the bible says the
[1:26:46] woman uh who the scripture says is the
[1:26:49] glory
[1:26:50] of the man and so she was to reflect if
[1:26:53] she's a glory
[1:26:54] she's a reflection uh when the woman
[1:26:57] the bible says that the woman disobeys
[1:26:59] and listens to the serpent
[1:27:01] and so so adam adam of course couldn't
[1:27:03] deny himself
[1:27:05] that's why brother branham says god adam
[1:27:07] took her in because he couldn't deny
[1:27:09] she was a part of him so he took her
[1:27:12] in committed the actual because brother
[1:27:14] of adam said that god
[1:27:15] knew adam knew that if he couldn't
[1:27:18] destroy him because he was part of god
[1:27:21] and so as an act of redemption he brings
[1:27:24] eve
[1:27:24] unto himself you say then
[1:27:28] how what did the second adam do well the
[1:27:30] same thing the second adam
[1:27:32] brought you to himself and nailed you to
[1:27:36] a tree and crucified you brother and
[1:27:38] says i was there
[1:27:39] i was there when they crucified him i
[1:27:41] was there when when he rose
[1:27:43] from the tomb
[1:27:46] and so it was it was it was
[1:27:50] it was the characteristic of eve
[1:27:54] she had the character of this
[1:27:57] atom there was there was a there was a
[1:28:00] life that came forth it was a reflection
[1:28:04] because she's of him she's from him she
[1:28:07] has to be part of him
[1:28:09] and in order to be part of him she had
[1:28:10] to originate with
[1:28:12] him from him can you say amen
[1:28:17] and so the bible says just as we spoke
[1:28:19] to you this morning about eliezer we
[1:28:21] took a lot of time to show you that
[1:28:23] that that that the bible says that not
[1:28:25] everyone who says
[1:28:27] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:28:29] of heaven
[1:28:30] not everyone who says lord lord there
[1:28:32] will be many as we
[1:28:33] read to you in isaiah 4 7 women who take
[1:28:36] a hold of one man
[1:28:38] many who profess the name of christ many
[1:28:42] of them who are
[1:28:43] saved but that doesn't mean that they're
[1:28:44] elect
[1:28:47] and it doesn't mean they're redeemed and
[1:28:49] and that doesn't mean they have the holy
[1:28:51] ghost you say how how can
[1:28:52] how can we have the holy ghost today
[1:28:54] because brother branham says
[1:28:56] only the elected can be reborn because
[1:28:58] what is the nat what is the rebirth
[1:29:00] that the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:29:03] the new birth
[1:29:04] and what happens when a person is born
[1:29:06] again that
[1:29:08] seed that was in them before the
[1:29:10] foundation of the world
[1:29:11] takes life what is the baptism of the
[1:29:15] holy ghost it's when the seed of god
[1:29:17] is quickened to life
[1:29:21] say when did i get that seed when i was
[1:29:24] at an altar no
[1:29:25] when i was born no actually way
[1:29:28] beyond that in the back part of god's
[1:29:32] mind that's election you were
[1:29:34] pre-you'll never understand election
[1:29:35] till you understand predestination
[1:29:37] what is election election isn't the way
[1:29:39] we would think because we're about to
[1:29:40] have an election here and what is an
[1:29:42] election it's based upon votes which are
[1:29:44] based upon
[1:29:44] what people like and the merits of one
[1:29:47] candidate
[1:29:47] but that's not the election that's the
[1:29:49] kind of god the kind of election that
[1:29:50] god does
[1:29:51] god's election is eternal
[1:29:56] jacob have i loved he saw have i hated
[1:29:58] and this per this
[1:29:59] decision paul says was made before
[1:30:01] either were born
[1:30:03] or either had done right or wrong go
[1:30:06] read your bible
[1:30:08] and he says that election might stand so
[1:30:11] election was in the back part of god's
[1:30:13] mind
[1:30:13] it's eternal that's why the prophet says
[1:30:16] if you
[1:30:17] he says you you didn't he says act and
[1:30:20] he picks this up in the sumerian church
[1:30:21] age
[1:30:22] he says even in in the upper room
[1:30:25] and he says peter he says they they
[1:30:27] didn't he says they didn't become
[1:30:29] sons on the day of pentecost
[1:30:32] they always were sons
[1:30:35] they only recognized who they were
[1:30:40] you didn't become a son by the infilling
[1:30:42] of the holy ghost
[1:30:43] you only recognized i'm not a chicken
[1:30:46] i'm an
[1:30:47] eagle you only recognize
[1:30:50] i'm not an alcoholic i'm a son of god
[1:30:54] i'm not part of this world i'm from
[1:30:56] another world
[1:30:58] you don't become a son by the birth you
[1:31:00] are reborn because
[1:31:02] you're a son and daughter of god that's
[1:31:04] why you're filled with the baptism of
[1:31:06] the holy ghost that's why because you've
[1:31:07] got a seed down inside of you
[1:31:11] and in that seed is the potential
[1:31:16] because a person can can go their whole
[1:31:18] life
[1:31:20] and and and never that seed never quick
[1:31:22] until the very last could be could be
[1:31:24] to the very end very last breath that
[1:31:26] they breathe
[1:31:29] it shouldn't ha it doesn't have to be
[1:31:30] that way
[1:31:32] but we know that the bible says that
[1:31:34] that that there's a
[1:31:35] but yet and we we to we we we've we've
[1:31:38] showed you all through the scripture
[1:31:39] you can go all the way from genesis and
[1:31:42] adam and eve you can move into the song
[1:31:44] of
[1:31:44] songs that's what the hebrew bible calls
[1:31:46] the song of solomon
[1:31:47] it was the song of songs in other words
[1:31:50] it was like the king of
[1:31:51] kings the lord of lords the song of
[1:31:54] songs it was the song of all songs it
[1:31:56] was his greatest
[1:31:58] writing and what was it about
[1:32:01] what was it about it was about a groom
[1:32:03] and a bride
[1:32:04] a husband and a wife a love affair
[1:32:07] what was the story of esther about what
[1:32:10] was the story of ruth and naomi about
[1:32:13] oh friends do you catch it here what was
[1:32:15] paul saying in ephesians when he said
[1:32:17] behold i speak of a mystery of christ
[1:32:20] and his bride and so this this
[1:32:24] theme is laced all the way out you move
[1:32:27] into the book of revelations
[1:32:28] now what do you have in revelations you
[1:32:30] have the end
[1:32:32] you have the beginnings in genesis you
[1:32:35] have the end in revelation
[1:32:36] the alpha the omega in the beginning
[1:32:39] there's a
[1:32:40] there's a there's a dominion an eden you
[1:32:42] have a husband
[1:32:43] adam you have a wife eve what do you
[1:32:45] have in revelation
[1:32:46] instead of an eden you have a new
[1:32:48] jerusalem
[1:32:50] and instead of adam and eve you have a
[1:32:52] bride
[1:32:53] and her groom the lord jesus christ
[1:32:56] you have the bride the spirit and the
[1:32:58] bride say
[1:32:59] come we read with you in revelations 21
[1:33:04] it's it's it's a story it's a love story
[1:33:06] that's why we said the bible is a book
[1:33:08] of marriage
[1:33:09] it's a love story
[1:33:12] but it's only written it's only those
[1:33:15] who are part of the love story can
[1:33:17] catch that it's a love story
[1:33:21] only those who are part of that you know
[1:33:23] why because you need
[1:33:24] you know there could be a there could be
[1:33:26] a a secret mission for all you know
[1:33:28] right now
[1:33:29] you know somewhere in in nevada there's
[1:33:31] a helicopter taken off with
[1:33:33] secret service agents or sills you know
[1:33:36] navy seals
[1:33:37] you don't know we don't know that you
[1:33:38] know you know why we don't they could be
[1:33:40] going on a special mission for all we
[1:33:41] know
[1:33:41] you know why we don't know because we
[1:33:43] don't need to know
[1:33:46] you know who knows about that mission
[1:33:48] those who are on a
[1:33:49] need to know basis you know why the rest
[1:33:51] of the world looks at the message and
[1:33:53] can't see anything in it but you see
[1:33:55] something about it because you
[1:33:57] needed to know hallelujah and because
[1:33:59] you're on a need to know basis
[1:34:01] no one else knows about it but god's
[1:34:03] secret elected family of god
[1:34:05] has been made privy to the secret things
[1:34:07] of god because you needed to know
[1:34:12] and so who is she she's the bride of
[1:34:14] christ she's a called out body
[1:34:16] a holy remnant who is this as we read
[1:34:19] this morning
[1:34:20] brother ram says who is it i don't know
[1:34:22] i hope i'm one
[1:34:23] i hope you all i hope there's many here
[1:34:24] it'll be one it'll be individuals it
[1:34:26] won't be a group
[1:34:27] it won't be some certain it won't be
[1:34:29] some certain certain group of people
[1:34:31] is it going to be in tucson is going to
[1:34:32] be jeffersonville where is it going to
[1:34:33] be where do we need
[1:34:34] what are they asking brother brandon
[1:34:36] after the seals brother and should we
[1:34:37] pack up should we move to tucson should
[1:34:38] we
[1:34:39] show you one person say this brother
[1:34:41] adam says you've missed all of it you
[1:34:42] missed everything
[1:34:46] he goes on further even after the seals
[1:34:49] are broke and he says
[1:34:50] he says what he says i'm not sure anyone
[1:34:53] even called it
[1:34:54] and he says what happened there in the
[1:34:56] corner national forest what happened
[1:34:59] uh there they missed it they're still
[1:35:01] scratching their heads that's exactly
[1:35:02] what he said he said they're still
[1:35:04] wondering what happened
[1:35:05] and god had already spoken god had
[1:35:08] already called out a bride and the rest
[1:35:09] of the world just
[1:35:10] kept going but someone got
[1:35:14] someone's attention i'm glad it got mine
[1:35:19] and so it's compromised as we said it
[1:35:22] comprises
[1:35:24] of all nations of all tongues of all
[1:35:26] people of the entire world of
[1:35:28] all ages not just this age there wasn't
[1:35:31] just a bride in this age there's been a
[1:35:32] bride throughout every age
[1:35:35] and and brother branham says that it he
[1:35:37] says even that that bride of the ages he
[1:35:40] calls for that in the preview of the
[1:35:41] church
[1:35:42] and he says then i seen this modern
[1:35:44] american church
[1:35:46] and he said just filthy rickies and
[1:35:48] raquettas he said if i ever seen a bunch
[1:35:50] he said just twisting and shaking and he
[1:35:52] says i bowed my head
[1:35:54] and he says and he says i just thought
[1:35:56] he says here they were
[1:35:57] barely just something gray covering them
[1:36:00] almost nude
[1:36:01] and he says and this is the church of
[1:36:03] america and brother man says i bowed my
[1:36:05] head i thought lord after all the
[1:36:06] preaching after all the ministry after
[1:36:08] the gospels went short of shore sea to
[1:36:10] sea
[1:36:12] he says this is the best and he says
[1:36:14] just a group
[1:36:15] we're dancing to the time of rock and
[1:36:16] roll
[1:36:18] being led by a witch that's what he's
[1:36:20] seen in the vision
[1:36:22] he says she was being led by a witch
[1:36:25] and he says as they they and the way
[1:36:27] brother ran him in three different
[1:36:28] places he speaks of this
[1:36:30] and he says they i watched them as they
[1:36:31] descended over like an edge or like it
[1:36:33] was like a canyon
[1:36:35] and he says following that witch as they
[1:36:36] went off into the abyss
[1:36:39] and he said i just bowed my head he said
[1:36:40] then the voice spoke and said but the
[1:36:42] bride will come into preview again
[1:36:45] and he said and here they were he said
[1:36:48] that spotless
[1:36:49] clothed in white group marching to the

[1:37:49] out of rhythm

[1:41:50] bride uh that the scripture speaks about
[1:41:52] all the way throughout the whole bible
[1:41:54] and he's preparing that bride for what
[1:41:57] for the marriage
[1:41:58] the marriage supper of the lamb where
[1:42:01] he'll introduce just as he introduced
[1:42:03] eve to adam
[1:42:04] he'll introduce he'll present that's
[1:42:05] what the scripture says that he may
[1:42:07] present to
[1:42:08] himself a glorious church not having
[1:42:12] spot or
[1:42:12] wrinkle and so you say brother matt what
[1:42:15] is bride character
[1:42:16] what is a characteristic let me give you
[1:42:19] some characteristics of the bride
[1:42:21] the bride a bride character is that you
[1:42:24] have a
[1:42:25] passion for jesus christ
[1:42:30] there's a passion i i can't i have no
[1:42:32] other
[1:42:33] way to describe that than to say there's
[1:42:35] a passion that she
[1:42:37] has that something some part of her when
[1:42:40] brother begins to describe that ephesian
[1:42:42] age
[1:42:42] who lost the love of god and he says
[1:42:45] what did they lose they lost their
[1:42:46] passion for the word
[1:42:49] they lost something he says the cry for
[1:42:53] reaching out in the spirit
[1:42:55] all began to fade and that church became
[1:42:58] formal
[1:43:01] and he says they read they lost their
[1:43:03] passion
[1:43:04] you know you can be passionate people i
[1:43:07] have met people
[1:43:08] who are passionate about their life
[1:43:10] dreams
[1:43:11] they're passionate about something ever
[1:43:13] seen someone met someone who's
[1:43:14] passionate yeah sure you have
[1:43:16] every single one of you are passionate
[1:43:17] about something
[1:43:20] just may not be passionate about the
[1:43:21] same things i'm passionate about
[1:43:24] some people are passionate about their
[1:43:26] job passionate about their home
[1:43:28] passionate about their career passionate
[1:43:31] about sports passionate about something
[1:43:33] some recreation
[1:43:35] passionate about hunting passionate
[1:43:37] about fishing oh no brother man no you
[1:43:39] didn't
[1:43:40] yes i did you can take something that's
[1:43:44] not sinful and make it sinful by
[1:43:46] letting it become an idol that stands
[1:43:47] between you and god
[1:43:49] and you prostitute your time to it
[1:43:52] that's the words of a prophet
[1:43:56] you give yourself so much to it now that
[1:43:58] was free that wasn't on my nose
[1:44:01] but they have a passion that's that's
[1:44:03] that's the first
[1:44:05] sign of bride character she's not a
[1:44:08] lukewarm as i hear the words of a
[1:44:10] prophet
[1:44:10] in the ladies in age she's not going to
[1:44:12] be he says who's that bride going to be
[1:44:14] she won't be a lukewarm hallelujah she
[1:44:17] won't be lukewarm
[1:44:19] she won't be cold she won't be
[1:44:21] half-hearted she won't be in one week
[1:44:23] and out the other she'll be passionate
[1:44:24] about the lord in his word
[1:44:28] she'll have a passion she'll have a
[1:44:31] passion
[1:44:32] she's loved why because she's in love
[1:44:34] she's in a love affair
[1:44:36] she's love sick for her lord she wants
[1:44:39] her lord
[1:44:40] that's what marks the bride is that they
[1:44:43] love the lord
[1:44:44] they want the lord they want his word
[1:44:46] but they don't want just an intellectual
[1:44:48] understanding they want him
[1:44:51] they want his person they they they you
[1:44:54] say what is it brother man
[1:44:56] they're marked by their love rather than
[1:44:59] their knowledge
[1:45:03] the bride of christ is marked by their
[1:45:06] love for the lord not their knowledge
[1:45:08] for the lord
[1:45:09] not their knowledge of him but him
[1:45:13] can you say amen it's at the church you
[1:45:17] look at the church world today
[1:45:18] it's it's it's it's spiritual death i
[1:45:22] ruined you say but how do they get to
[1:45:23] that spiritual uh
[1:45:25] state of death by an incessant pursuit
[1:45:28] of knowledge but they missed him
[1:45:32] they have all the knowledge and they
[1:45:34] fill all their minds with all some of
[1:45:35] the most intellectual preaching
[1:45:37] uh uh articulate gifted men with
[1:45:41] a great articulate beautiful sermons
[1:45:44] with

[1:45:54] i can barely speak one brother aaron
[1:45:58] you got to know five you gotta do five
[1:46:01] there by the man are you criticizing
[1:46:02] them no i'm not
[1:46:05] because you know why that's what they're
[1:46:07] called to be
[1:46:09] and they've got a purpose and god has a
[1:46:11] plan
[1:46:13] i'm not any better than they are hello
[1:46:17] nothing of myself
[1:46:22] brother branham says it that way says
[1:46:24] you're he says you're you're you're
[1:46:25] loved in the beloved it's only the love
[1:46:28] of christ that makes you different than
[1:46:29] anybody else
[1:46:32] they're known by their knowledge not
[1:46:33] their not their intellect not their
[1:46:35] theology
[1:46:36] bible schools cemeteries seminaries if
[1:46:39] you want to call them
[1:46:40] filled with teachers and students who
[1:46:42] spend years engrossed in
[1:46:44] doctrines and and and the inerrancy of
[1:46:47] the bible and the infallibility
[1:46:49] and all the textual variants of all the
[1:46:51] different languages and
[1:46:52] all the ways it was translated all of
[1:46:54] those things are good brothers and
[1:46:56] sisters don't
[1:46:56] don't let me don't take me wrong those
[1:46:58] things are fine
[1:46:59] but that's not who the bride is the
[1:47:02] bride doesn't want knowledge
[1:47:04] she wants him can you say amen tonight
[1:47:08] the bride doesn't she it's good to know
[1:47:10] but it's better to know him paul said to
[1:47:12] know him as life
[1:47:13] that's why the brother of adam says i
[1:47:14] may not know his book but i know the
[1:47:16] author
[1:47:17] i mean you know that's such an amazing
[1:47:19] thing because he knew the book really
[1:47:20] well
[1:47:22] knew the book really well but yet it was
[1:47:24] a man who was humble enough to just say
[1:47:27] i may not know the book as you know the
[1:47:30] book
[1:47:31] but i know the author of the book
[1:47:38] you say brother matt what are you uh are
[1:47:40] you preaching against that
[1:47:42] intelligence no no no no no not
[1:47:44] preaching against
[1:47:45] education it's good good to have
[1:47:47] education you're preaching against
[1:47:49] learning more about the bible absolutely
[1:47:51] not it's what i spend my life
[1:47:52] doing learning learning more about about
[1:47:55] about the
[1:47:56] the mysteries in the in the message
[1:47:58] learning more about the mysteries
[1:48:00] revealed by the message that came out of
[1:48:01] the bible
[1:48:02] no i spent my life doing it love it it's
[1:48:04] my passion love studying the word of god
[1:48:08] but let me just say this it's that ins
[1:48:10] is
[1:48:11] a lady a seeing lukewarm church
[1:48:15] the church that intellectually has
[1:48:17] everything right
[1:48:19] knows how to knows how to do everything
[1:48:21] for anybody
[1:48:22] uh uh can and you know has has some of
[1:48:25] the greatest
[1:48:26] programs some of the greatest resources
[1:48:31] there they're they're rich
[1:48:33] the bible says that they're rich and
[1:48:34] increase with goods
[1:48:36] have need of nothing
[1:48:40] have everything covered have their in
[1:48:42] their in their church
[1:48:44] staff they have psychologists and
[1:48:46] psychiatrists and
[1:48:48] counselors and and just everything you
[1:48:50] could think of in
[1:48:51] school programs and after school
[1:48:53] programs and day cares in the church
[1:48:57] and and and and all kind you say
[1:48:59] programs they outshine us
[1:49:01] by by by ten to one
[1:49:05] by programs but they're the the this is
[1:49:08] exactly what the bible describes
[1:49:10] let me just say this there's never been
[1:49:11] a church an age
[1:49:13] knowledgeable with more access to
[1:49:16] information
[1:49:18] that was the dawning of information
[1:49:21] where you can just google anything
[1:49:23] and and find it on on good old brother
[1:49:26] wikipedia
[1:49:27] and it's the gospel truth apparently
[1:49:28] everybody thinks so
[1:49:31] then you just know everything does that
[1:49:33] mean everything's right
[1:49:34] oh boy if you believe
[1:49:38] that you you don't believe nothing you
[1:49:40] don't believe in anything
[1:49:43] hello well how do you know it's true
[1:49:46] google and no one may never say it but
[1:49:49] their lives reveal what they really
[1:49:51] believe
[1:49:52] they ain't living in expectation like
[1:49:54] he's coming tomorrow
[1:49:56] hello that's what brother branham says
[1:49:59] he says they
[1:49:59] they plant your potatoes like he's
[1:50:02] coming in 100 years
[1:50:03] but live like he's coming tomorrow a lot
[1:50:06] of people love that i'm planting my
[1:50:07] potatoes but are you living like he's
[1:50:08] coming tomorrow
[1:50:11] you took one part you didn't you left
[1:50:12] off the other i'm planting my potatoes
[1:50:14] i'm just going to keep on building the
[1:50:15] business going to keep on building my
[1:50:17] homes
[1:50:17] and i'm just planting my potatoes but
[1:50:19] but are you living
[1:50:20] how's your life are you living an
[1:50:23] expectation
[1:50:24] like he's coming in the morning
[1:50:27] or do you have you taken prey to this
[1:50:30] spirit
[1:50:30] of delusion that comes in the last day
[1:50:32] of he just delayeth is coming
[1:50:34] and and and you know what that does you
[1:50:36] know when a person loses
[1:50:38] their that when a person loses their
[1:50:40] expectancy of the lord
[1:50:42] is coming could come in the morning you
[1:50:44] know what that does
[1:50:45] immediately you lose your intensity and
[1:50:48] your love
[1:50:48] and your zeal and your passion for the
[1:50:50] lord
[1:50:53] because he's just coming any old day
[1:50:54] doesn't really don't really know
[1:50:57] you live life to the fullest you get
[1:50:59] everything you can out of life and as
[1:51:01] quick as you can and as much as you can
[1:51:04] sadly this is the state of many people
[1:51:06] who sit on church pews
[1:51:09] living confessing oh i believe the lord
[1:51:12] could come but their life shows that
[1:51:13] they don't really believe that
[1:51:16] they they really don't i mean you know
[1:51:18] if you really believe that you'd be at
[1:51:19] church every time the doors are open
[1:51:24] oh man might have to just go under here
[1:51:26] brother aaron and preach from behind
[1:51:27] here
[1:51:28] make sure no one throws nothing at me
[1:51:32] can you say man hey confess it but they
[1:51:35] don't live like it
[1:51:36] live like it's coming tomorrow there's
[1:51:38] an expectation
[1:51:40] it's bright character she believes that
[1:51:43] he's coming
[1:51:44] in the morning he can come at any moment
[1:51:47] notice what it says in matthew 25
[1:51:50] this is the parable of the ten virgins
[1:51:52] it says while the bridegroom
[1:51:54] tarried notice while the bridegroom
[1:51:57] tarried this is matthew 25 verse 5.
[1:52:00] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[1:52:04] slumbered and slept
[1:52:07] what produced slumber and sleep
[1:52:10] drowsiness
[1:52:11] and laziness spiritually when the lord's
[1:52:14] just in that delay
[1:52:15] in that terry uh but but but the bride
[1:52:19] what is bright character she's awake
[1:52:22] she's arising she's shining
[1:52:26] she's in expectation why because she's
[1:52:28] in the word she's feeding on the word
[1:52:31] and the words giving her life and the
[1:52:33] words giving her revelation
[1:52:35] and she knows he could come at any
[1:52:37] moment i see his signs appearing
[1:52:39] around everywhere his signs are
[1:52:42] appearing
[1:52:44] but while the bridegroom tarried they
[1:52:47] slumbered and slept
[1:52:48] peter says it this way in second peter 3
[1:52:51] 12 looking for
[1:52:53] and hasting unto the coming of the day
[1:52:55] of god
[1:52:56] where in the heavens being on fire shall
[1:52:58] be dissolved in the elements shall mur
[1:53:00] melt with fervent heat so what is it
[1:53:04] he's he's coming soon how are you going
[1:53:07] to live your life
[1:53:08] like he's coming soon say what about
[1:53:10] those who died
[1:53:13] and they lived like he was coming soon
[1:53:15] brother branham answers that question
[1:53:17] and he says those that went in the grave
[1:53:19] and he says if they went into a grave
[1:53:22] expecting the coming of the lord they
[1:53:24] come out of that
[1:53:25] grave with the same expectation in their
[1:53:28] heart
[1:53:29] he says they come out and they expect
[1:53:31] and they see what they expect
[1:53:34] how long are you going to expect till i
[1:53:36] breathe my last breath he said brother
[1:53:38] man is he coming if he's not coming as
[1:53:40] we said this morning then why do i
[1:53:41] feel him in my heart why do i hear his
[1:53:44] footsteps
[1:53:45] why do i hear his voice is the lord
[1:53:47] jesus coming
[1:53:48] i believe it's now closer than it's ever
[1:53:50] been before for now
[1:53:51] as the bible says for now your salvation
[1:53:54] is
[1:53:55] nearer than it's ever been before you
[1:53:57] say how do you know because i can feel
[1:53:59] it in my heart
[1:54:00] because there's a yearning there's a
[1:54:01] burning and i didn't put that there
[1:54:03] god put that there there's a deep
[1:54:05] calling to a deep
[1:54:07] and there's got to be a deep to respond
[1:54:09] to the cry that i feel
[1:54:12] there's a yearning for the holy spirit
[1:54:14] oh do you feel that church
[1:54:16] there's a yearning and a pulling to tell
[1:54:19] me
[1:54:19] get away from the world get away from
[1:54:21] the things of the world get don't don't
[1:54:23] get distracted
[1:54:24] don't get your eyes focused on the world
[1:54:26] and the entertainments of the world
[1:54:28] but get your eyes on jesus
[1:54:34] get your eyes on jesus you can hear the
[1:54:37] words
[1:54:38] of the lord if you listen if you listen
[1:54:41] close

[1:54:45] those
[1:54:46] those uh golden bells if you listen
[1:54:49] close you can almost hear that angelic
[1:54:51] choir
[1:54:52] if you listen close you can almost hear
[1:54:54] as paul said we are surrounded by a
[1:54:56] cloud of
[1:54:56] many witnesses who are those witnesses
[1:55:00] that's my grandfather
[1:55:01] who went to a grave believing for the
[1:55:04] coming of the lord he's in the cloud of
[1:55:06] witnesses
[1:55:07] saying lay aside all the weights of the
[1:55:09] world
[1:55:10] don't be distracted don't get your line
[1:55:12] tangled up
[1:55:13] but lay aside the weights of the world
[1:55:16] get your eyes focused on
[1:55:18] jesus
[1:55:21] get your eyes focused on the lord be
[1:55:23] like mary
[1:55:25] magdalene who the bible begins to speak
[1:55:28] of in john first and in john chapter 20.
[1:55:30] if you want to turn there john 20 verse
[1:55:32] 1. we're going to close
[1:55:33] here just bear with me give me a couple
[1:55:35] more minutes here
[1:55:38] this is this is a woman who loves the
[1:55:40] lord it's a woman who's
[1:55:42] passionate she's a type of the bride
[1:55:46] who's passionate for the lord she wants
[1:55:49] him she hasn't she has
[1:55:51] affections it's it consumes her
[1:55:55] this woman uh the bible says that
[1:55:58] the scripture says that she comes in
[1:56:00] john 21 the first day of the week
[1:56:02] i want you to notice this here for a
[1:56:04] minute mary now here's what mary
[1:56:06] magdalene wasn't
[1:56:08] mary magdalene wasn't an intellectual
[1:56:12] wasn't educated per se but you know what
[1:56:15] her life was marked by
[1:56:16] her lovation and her affection
[1:56:20] for the lord she was a woman who
[1:56:23] who the bible says that that she's now
[1:56:26] noticed this a lot
[1:56:27] because you you can get confused on
[1:56:28] these which mary this is mary magdalene
[1:56:31] here
[1:56:32] and that the scripture says this is the
[1:56:33] woman whose demon spirits were cast
[1:56:36] out of this is that mary
[1:56:39] she's got a lot to be grateful for he's
[1:56:41] got a lot to love the lord for us he's
[1:56:43] got a lot to live for jesus for
[1:56:45] because he did so much for her and and
[1:56:48] the bible says that
[1:56:50] here she comes and and and and let me
[1:56:53] just find my place here in the scripture
[1:56:55] it says the first day of the week cometh
[1:56:57] mary magdalene early when it was yet
[1:56:59] dark
[1:57:00] unto the sepulcher and seeth the stone
[1:57:04] taken away from the sepulchre
[1:57:08] this was a bin uh bible historians
[1:57:10] believe at about four o'clock in the
[1:57:12] morning
[1:57:13] she's up early in the dark in the night
[1:57:17] she comes there early now you notice
[1:57:20] who's absent
[1:57:22] peter
[1:57:25] any of the rest of the disciples doesn't
[1:57:26] say the church was gathered at the
[1:57:28] sepulcher early
[1:57:30] but one woman out of the many
[1:57:33] won one is an expectation
[1:57:37] one is in travail one is looking for the
[1:57:40] lord
[1:57:44] sleeping where's peter where's the rest
[1:57:48] of the disciples
[1:57:49] while the others slept
[1:57:55] early when it was yet dark and the bible
[1:57:58] says she sees the stone rolled away
[1:58:01] and then his body's not there and so she
[1:58:04] she runs and she
[1:58:05] she finds peter and john and the
[1:58:07] disciple says that the bible says that
[1:58:10] that all of peter and the rest of the
[1:58:11] disciples come to the tomb and
[1:58:13] they see the linen uh cloth and it's
[1:58:16] verse eight i think it is
[1:58:17] and it says they they see the linen
[1:58:19] cloth and it's folded
[1:58:21] and then when also that the other
[1:58:22] disciple which came first to the
[1:58:24] sepulcher and he saw and believed
[1:58:26] oh so they see all this they hun here's
[1:58:28] what they knew he's not there
[1:58:32] it's not there and the bible says then
[1:58:34] they then
[1:58:35] he saw and believed
[1:58:38] you know what they're remembering
[1:58:39] they're now they're remembering the
[1:58:41] words of jesus
[1:58:43] now they're remembering what he told
[1:58:45] them now they're
[1:58:46] seeing and believing and the scripture
[1:58:50] says in verse 10. now notice this
[1:58:52] verse 10 and it says then the disciples
[1:58:56] went away again unto their own
[1:59:00] home left
[1:59:02] came to church he's not there he's risen
[1:59:05] now we're going to lunch
[1:59:06] i mean home
[1:59:09] now we're going home the bible says
[1:59:13] they were they he's not there he's not
[1:59:15] in the tomb they see that
[1:59:17] they in fact go further and the bible
[1:59:19] says they believed
[1:59:20] and now that they go back home but but
[1:59:24] you know you see that so much today my
[1:59:25] brother and my sister people are just
[1:59:27] content
[1:59:28] with coming and believing he's
[1:59:29] resurrected we came for the honors
[1:59:31] resurrection we're here now we're going
[1:59:32] home
[1:59:33] some people don't you know some people
[1:59:35] only show up for easter
[1:59:37] and for christmas and for holidays where
[1:59:39] are they the rest of the year
[1:59:43] they go home they're satisfied
[1:59:46] with the knowledge oh i hope you catch
[1:59:48] it
[1:59:49] they're satisfied with the knowledge
[1:59:51] that he's not there that he's
[1:59:52] resurrected
[1:59:53] but mary magdalene's not satisfied with
[1:59:56] that knowledge
[1:59:57] she wants to know where is he where is
[2:00:00] my lord where have they taken him
[2:00:02] i want to have him not just the
[2:00:04] knowledge of his resurrection i want to
[2:00:06] know where
[2:00:07] is my lord she's one woman
[2:00:10] a bride type of the bride who's an
[2:00:13] expectation
[2:00:14] not just with the knowledge that he's
[2:00:16] not there but she says where's he at
[2:00:20] mary stood the bible says in verse 11.
[2:00:23] now the disciples verse 10 the disciples
[2:00:25] went away again into their own home but
[2:00:27] verse 11.
[2:00:28] but mary stood without
[2:00:33] at the sepulcher weeping
[2:00:36] and as she wept she stooped down
[2:00:40] and looked what's wrong mary what's
[2:00:42] wrong
[2:00:43] what's bothering you why are you crying
[2:00:46] he's not there
[2:00:47] he's risen go home
[2:00:51] go home mary he said enough to know
[2:00:54] it's enough to know that he's not theirs
[2:00:56] you've seen the linen cloth you see he's
[2:00:58] not there he's risen just like he said
[2:01:01] what's wrong mary the bible says mary
[2:01:04] stays
[2:01:05] disciples go but she stays she stood
[2:01:09] without the sepulcher
[2:01:11] weeping why because for mary's
[2:01:15] world this was her world
[2:01:19] for her the world without jesus was not
[2:01:22] a world she wanted to live in
[2:01:24] the world without him not the knowledge
[2:01:26] of him
[2:01:27] not the intellect of him but without
[2:01:29] having
[2:01:30] him it wasn't worth living and mary said
[2:01:33] i'm going to stay here
[2:01:34] because this is the only spot i've came
[2:01:36] to the end of everything unless i have
[2:01:39] him
[2:01:39] what does the song say because he lives
[2:01:42] i can face tomorrow
[2:01:44] because i know yes i know oh he holds my
[2:01:48] future then life is worth the living
[2:01:51] just because he lives
[2:01:57] verse 13. notice what mary begins to say
[2:02:00] here
[2:02:01] and they say unto her woman
[2:02:04] why weepest thou she said unto him
[2:02:07] because don't you know how important
[2:02:10] this is
[2:02:10] you know what you're seeing you're
[2:02:11] seeing a bride who's passionate
[2:02:15] you see you know you're not seeing a
[2:02:16] woman who's casual
[2:02:19] and i've seen a woman who's distracted
[2:02:21] and her mind's on a thousand other
[2:02:22] things
[2:02:23] she's focused she's laser focused
[2:02:26] you've seen a woman who's passionate she
[2:02:29] says because
[2:02:30] they have taken away my lord and i
[2:02:34] know not where they have laid him
[2:02:40] i know not or they have laid him
[2:02:43] and nothing is going to satisfy me
[2:02:46] nothing's going to satisfy me
[2:02:48] until i know and the bible says in verse
[2:02:50] 12 and verse look at verse 11 go back to
[2:02:53] verse 11.
[2:02:54] trump says but mary said without the
[2:02:55] second girl weeping and she wept she
[2:02:56] stooped down and looked at the sepulcher
[2:02:58] verse 12
[2:02:59] and it says it says and seeth two angels
[2:03:02] in white sitting the one at the head and
[2:03:04] the other at the feet
[2:03:06] wherein they laid where in the body of
[2:03:08] jesus said lane verse 13 the verse we
[2:03:10] just read
[2:03:11] and notice what it says here and as she
[2:03:13] wept she stooped down look at the
[2:03:14] sepulchre seeing the two angels
[2:03:16] now notice here's here's the rest of
[2:03:18] everybody at home
[2:03:21] here's the rest of everybody content and
[2:03:24] now because
[2:03:25] because mary stayed she gets a
[2:03:29] visitation from angels
[2:03:32] the rest of them didn't get this brother
[2:03:33] aaron brother peter didn't get it
[2:03:35] the rest of the disciples didn't get it
[2:03:36] they were home but one woman because she
[2:03:38] was passionate
[2:03:39] for the lord who does the lord reveal
[2:03:41] himself to
[2:03:43] say i want though if i could just hear
[2:03:44] from the lord how much do you wait on
[2:03:46] him
[2:03:47] i just want to see the lord how much do
[2:03:49] you look for him really
[2:03:52] i didn't see the lord when i went to
[2:03:53] church well what'd you come looking for
[2:03:58] how often do you wait in in prayer
[2:04:01] friend i know it's so simple but i just
[2:04:03] want to challenge you tonight
[2:04:04] how passionate we're the bride of jesus
[2:04:07] christ how passionate are we really
[2:04:10] how much do we want to see him what does
[2:04:13] it mean to us
[2:04:15] it ought to mean everything it ought to
[2:04:17] we ought to be totally
[2:04:19] devoted completely sold out
[2:04:23] to see in the lord every day in our life
[2:04:27] she turned the bible says in verse 14
[2:04:30] scripture says now notice this verse 14
[2:04:32] the next verse brother
[2:04:34] it says she turned herself back and and
[2:04:37] and so
[2:04:38] and when she had this uh and when she
[2:04:40] had thus said she turned herself back
[2:04:42] and saw jesus standing
[2:04:44] and knew not that it was jesus jesus
[2:04:46] said unto her
[2:04:47] woman notice what he calls her woman now
[2:04:52] she doesn't respond to that
[2:04:54] that does nothing for her doesn't open
[2:04:57] her eyes she's still blind to who he is
[2:05:00] doesn't see it's jesus
[2:05:05] woman why we piss now ask the same
[2:05:09] question
[2:05:11] whom seekest thou she's supposing him to
[2:05:15] be the gardener
[2:05:16] said in him sir if thou had borne him
[2:05:20] hence tell me where thou has laid him
[2:05:24] and i will take him away what did she
[2:05:27] want she wanted him
[2:05:28] for herself she said if no one else
[2:05:31] can have it if no one can have him i can
[2:05:33] have him if no one else can get him i
[2:05:35] want to have him he's mine
[2:05:37] oh as the song says mine mine mine jesus
[2:05:40] is mine
[2:05:41] mine when i'm weary mine when i'm dreary
[2:05:43] this is what mary was saying i want him
[2:05:45] for myself verse 16
[2:05:50] jesus said unto her
[2:05:53] mary now he's no longer calling her
[2:05:57] woman
[2:05:57] why because he first comes to her
[2:06:00] at a voice that she can't recognize as
[2:06:03] many times the lord pushes upon your
[2:06:05] heart
[2:06:05] and he doesn't reveal himself until you
[2:06:07] accept him
[2:06:08] and let him in and then he says mary
[2:06:11] because what did he see
[2:06:12] seen a passion about her that she wanted
[2:06:15] him not his knowledge
[2:06:16] not his books not not his intellect not
[2:06:18] anything about him
[2:06:20] not the history of him not the miracle
[2:06:22] of yesterday
[2:06:23] she wanted hume
[2:06:27] and the bible says he said unto her mary
[2:06:31] she turned herself and said unto him
[2:06:33] rabboni which is to say now the same
[2:06:35] voice but now
[2:06:37] she recognizes it notice he called her
[2:06:39] by name
[2:06:40] why because he knows you by name he knew
[2:06:43] mary by name
[2:06:44] it wasn't just going to be woman it was
[2:06:46] going to be bride that's why brother
[2:06:47] adam says i no longer call you church
[2:06:49] you got a name your name is bride
[2:06:51] elected
[2:06:52] lady the elected lady of god
[2:06:56] mary and now she hear
[2:06:59] something's different about that voice
[2:07:02] you see something changes
[2:07:04] when you really press into god something
[2:07:07] changes
[2:07:10] i'm speaking very naturally here just
[2:07:12] for a moment as
[2:07:13] we close musicians could you come
[2:07:17] something changes you know there's a
[2:07:20] certain
[2:07:22] there's a certain threshold that you can
[2:07:25] cross
[2:07:26] brother branham preaches a message and
[2:07:28] he calls it
[2:07:30] a hidden life in christ
[2:07:33] and he he speaks about that life that's
[2:07:36] that's
[2:07:36] that's hidden hidden away the lord
[2:07:40] and you know what you're in your
[2:07:42] knowledge of the lord i've felt it many
[2:07:44] times
[2:07:45] i can't tell you i can't testify to you
[2:07:48] enough
[2:07:49] how many times i've got down on my knees
[2:07:51] and
[2:07:52] begin to speak to the lord just uh
[2:07:56] just a recent memory here just beginning
[2:07:59] to speak to the lord
[2:08:01] i knew the lord was listening saying how
[2:08:03] do you know the lord is listening
[2:08:05] because the bible tells me that he's
[2:08:07] listening
[2:08:08] he said did he stop and say i'm
[2:08:10] listening no but i believe his word and
[2:08:11] his word says he listens
[2:08:12] he says this is our confidence when we
[2:08:14] pray he hears our prayer
[2:08:17] i began to pray and just and begin to
[2:08:19] just talk to the lord
[2:08:20] you know just begin to pour your heart
[2:08:22] out to the lord
[2:08:23] as you can do in your own way
[2:08:28] many times it's happened and and and and
[2:08:31] prayers
[2:08:32] and you pray and you're pouring your
[2:08:34] heart to the lord and i knew the lord
[2:08:35] was listening
[2:08:36] the lord is hearing him and
[2:08:39] let's begin to to worship many times in
[2:08:42] prayer
[2:08:42] i'll just in the middle of my prayer
[2:08:44] i'll just start singing
[2:08:46] worship to the lord and then go back
[2:08:48] into prayer then go back into psalm and
[2:08:49] go back into
[2:08:50] prayer maybe you do it a different way
[2:08:52] but in each his own way
[2:08:54] and and and you know many times i've
[2:08:57] i've got down on my knees and i've
[2:08:58] prayed and
[2:08:59] talked to the lord felt like i'd made my
[2:09:00] positions known
[2:09:02] and i said amen the prayer was i left i
[2:09:05] left it at the lord and i went on
[2:09:07] but you know there's been there's been
[2:09:09] times when i've prayed
[2:09:11] and i've talked to the lord i know he's
[2:09:13] listening
[2:09:14] and i just begin to pour my heart out
[2:09:17] sinks onto the lord
[2:09:18] and then suddenly something changes and
[2:09:21] it's like the whole atmosphere and the
[2:09:22] whole room
[2:09:24] in my living room just completely
[2:09:26] changed
[2:09:28] and i know this this isn't this isn't
[2:09:30] this wasn't like it was one second ago
[2:09:34] and i could feel the nearness of the
[2:09:36] holy spirit the lord to settle down
[2:09:39] and it's and and and you can you just
[2:09:41] know the presence of god is there
[2:09:44] right now begin to pray
[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:48] just once i knew the lord was in the
[2:09:50] room that i
[2:09:51] really began to just let it all out just
[2:09:54] let it all out said lord now i know
[2:09:56] you're here
[2:09:57] now i know you're listening so i'm going
[2:09:58] to tell you everything i've been wanting
[2:09:59] to tell you
[2:10:00] i'm going to tell you all my problems
[2:10:02] i'm going to tell you everything i'm
[2:10:03] facing i'm going to
[2:10:04] i'm going to pour out my heart about
[2:10:06] everything i'm going to because i don't
[2:10:07] have anyone else to talk to
[2:10:09] that can really help me in the way you
[2:10:11] can help me so now lord
[2:10:12] now that i know you're listening now you
[2:10:14] just take a moment to
[2:10:15] let me just let me just cry out to you
[2:10:17] and what i need
[2:10:19] what i what what what's happening in my
[2:10:21] own life and i knew the holy spirit was
[2:10:23] listening
[2:10:24] can just feel the presence of the lord
[2:10:25] you just feel so small
[2:10:27] you know what it is it's oppressing to
[2:10:29] where just like he spoke to mary and he
[2:10:31] calls her woman and then it changes and
[2:10:33] he says mary
[2:10:34] and then everything changes that's
[2:10:37] happened he said brother matt that
[2:10:38] happens in prayer it does you can cross
[2:10:40] brother branham says you can go deep
[2:10:41] enough in the lord in prayer
[2:10:44] many times people have i testified you
[2:10:46] before you know many times that's
[2:10:48] happened to me the lord i'll start
[2:10:49] speaking in tongues right in my prayer
[2:10:51] closet
[2:10:52] you say why does that happen well i
[2:10:54] don't know the lord decides that it's
[2:10:55] going to happen
[2:10:56] and it happens many times it's not
[2:10:59] tongues many times it's tears
[2:11:02] tears are a language god understands you
[2:11:05] may not speak in tongues
[2:11:06] paul said not all speak with tongues you
[2:11:09] may
[2:11:10] speak with tears but there's something
[2:11:13] different
[2:11:14] it's not just words it's not just a
[2:11:16] prayer that you're praying it's not just
[2:11:18] singing
[2:11:19] you know many times in worship i've been
[2:11:21] sitting in a church pew
[2:11:23] and come to church after church service
[2:11:25] and praise and raise my hands
[2:11:27] but then there's some unique special
[2:11:29] times when i feel the presence of god
[2:11:32] charge me like an electricity like an
[2:11:34] electric bolt
[2:11:35] going through my body and now it's no
[2:11:37] longer woman
