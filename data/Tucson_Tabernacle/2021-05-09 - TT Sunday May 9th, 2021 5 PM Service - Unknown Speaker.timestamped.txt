[55:04] give them a whole bouquet we just give
[55:06] them a little rose
[55:06] in fact we just keep giving roses how's
[55:08] that sound amen happy mother's day to
[55:11] all the mothers
[55:12] amen i want to thank you all for
[55:14] listening this morning my goodness i
[55:15] don't know if i've ever seen you all
[55:16] listen
[55:17] everybody's eyes are just so intense and
[55:19] listening and i probably could have
[55:20] preached another hour but
[55:22] i'm trying to be better right trying to
[55:24] be good and not preach as long
[55:26] amen we want brother robert figueroa to
[55:28] come i remember when he was here
[55:31] and we'd been down to his church when
[55:32] brother zach wallace had preached here a
[55:34] few years ago
[55:36] but when he came to the easter meetings
[55:37] we had him pray i just felt the kindred
[55:39] spirit the lord kind of welded our
[55:41] spirits together and we had
[55:43] lunch together the other day and i just
[55:45] appreciate our brother robert i
[55:46] appreciate his spirit
[55:48] amen so many ministers as they get older
[55:51] they've been through so many battles
[55:52] sometimes their spirit gets a little
[55:54] bitter
[55:56] he was telling us the other day how you
[55:57] gotta sweeten your spirit
[56:00] with prayer and drain all of that stuff
[56:02] out put the
[56:03] drain plug back in and say lord fill me
[56:05] up with the holy spirit
[56:06] yes amen amen i was thinking about that
[56:08] i think he's
[56:10] actually helped here at the church about
[56:12] 28 years i think he mentioned something
[56:14] like that and he's been helping the
[56:16] sister church down in sarah vista and
[56:19] i just asked him if you wouldn't mind
[56:21] coming and just
[56:22] preaching the gospel and amen i told him
[56:24] to just take his liberty and preach
[56:26] whatever is on his heart
[56:27] and this is a spirit-filled church right
[56:29] that means you let the holy spirit say
[56:31] whatever he wants to say
[56:32] because if it's the holy spirit saying
[56:34] it'll be right and we as ministers we
[56:36] have to go back and study and get in the
[56:38] word and the message and be sure that
[56:39] it's what the bible says what the spirit
[56:42] says to the church what the message says

[1:04:25] christ's name
[1:04:26] and the church said god bless you and be
[1:04:28] seated tonight
[1:04:32] some time ago i was reading the bible
[1:04:35] before going to work and
[1:04:38] i was reading there in second
[1:04:39] corinthians chapter
[1:04:41] 10 verses three and four and i've read
[1:04:44] that many many times and
[1:04:46] the brothers could put it on on the on
[1:04:47] the board there uh
[1:04:50] you know you can read a scripture all
[1:04:53] your life and
[1:04:54] one day you read it and it will just
[1:04:56] jump out of the page at you
[1:04:58] and i looked at it and i'd never noticed
[1:05:00] before where it says
[1:05:01] for the weapons of our warfare though we
[1:05:04] walk in the flesh we wore not after the
[1:05:06] flesh
[1:05:07] amen we're not fighting with an m16
[1:05:10] or hand grenade it is a spiritual
[1:05:13] warfare
[1:05:14] i heard brother brown saying the tape
[1:05:15] this morning that our
[1:05:17] our armor is spiritual because the
[1:05:20] battle is spiritual
[1:05:22] amen but that spiritual will can destroy
[1:05:26] your life here on earth if you're not
[1:05:28] careful
[1:05:29] and it says there though it says though
[1:05:31] we walk in the flesh we wore not after
[1:05:33] the flesh
[1:05:34] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:05:36] carnal but mighty through god
[1:05:38] and i never noticed it before i'd read
[1:05:40] it i've memorized it
[1:05:42] and reading it that morning i saw the
[1:05:45] word
[1:05:46] weapons and i said weapons it's a plural
[1:05:50] more than one weapon and i know that
[1:05:53] the word of god is likened unto a weapon
[1:05:56] amen is the sword of the spirit
[1:05:59] for the word of god is quick and
[1:06:00] powerful and sharper
[1:06:02] than any two widget sword piercing even
[1:06:04] to the dividing asunder of soul and
[1:06:06] spirit
[1:06:06] and of the joints and marrow and there's
[1:06:08] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:06:10] of the heart
[1:06:11] so we know that this word is god this
[1:06:13] this word of god is a weapon
[1:06:15] if you ever heard the message the
[1:06:17] greatest battle ever fought
[1:06:19] you have a better understanding of this
[1:06:21] of this word
[1:06:22] and how it is to be utilized as a weapon
[1:06:25] and i was reading that i said lord i
[1:06:27] said weapons and i never thought about
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:30] i said what other weapons are there i'm
[1:06:32] praying i'm meditating
[1:06:33] talking to god said lord what are the
[1:06:35] weapons and immediately he impressed
[1:06:37] upon my heart where brother branham said
[1:06:39] when the weakest saint gets on his knees
[1:06:42] before god
[1:06:43] satan trembles and i thought wow
[1:06:47] that's a weapon that is a weapon
[1:06:51] and i and i began to preach it to my
[1:06:53] church i said this is a weapon
[1:06:55] and i began to bring a series on it and
[1:06:58] and and it wasn't until later some
[1:07:01] months later
[1:07:02] i happened to find this little pamphlet
[1:07:04] in my bookshelf
[1:07:05] just collecting dust there and it's
[1:07:07] called a call a call to prayer
[1:07:10] and then there are quotes from brother
[1:07:11] branham about prayer
[1:07:14] and he talks about this this this prayer
[1:07:16] being more powerful
[1:07:18] than a hydrogen bomb than an atom bomb
[1:07:21] greatest weapon that ever been placed in
[1:07:23] the hands of humans
[1:07:24] just quote after quote not knowing the
[1:07:26] prophet has said these things
[1:07:28] and i believe in my spirit sometimes you
[1:07:31] don't you don't need to hear the prophet
[1:07:33] say it
[1:07:33] in your spirit you receive something
[1:07:36] that sounds right
[1:07:37] that sounds true why because the holy
[1:07:39] spirit in you
[1:07:40] will say amen to every word of god
[1:07:44] some people might stand back and say
[1:07:45] well i don't know if the prophet said
[1:07:47] that but if you got the holy ghost
[1:07:49] amen and if that's the word of god that
[1:07:51] that spirit in you go say amen
[1:07:54] amen every time to that word of god
[1:07:58] and so i began to preach that and
[1:08:02] and if you if you get your bibles turned
[1:08:04] to isaiah 66
[1:08:06] chapter one and two and there's
[1:08:07] something about prayer there's not just
[1:08:09] about praying but you know one of the
[1:08:11] things how we approach god
[1:08:13] in our prayer it's important we approach
[1:08:16] it in the right way
[1:08:18] you know we're we're coming unto the
[1:08:19] king of kings
[1:08:21] if you were going to approach the queen
[1:08:22] of of england
[1:08:24] how would you approach her there's a
[1:08:27] certain etiquette there's some way
[1:08:28] that you things you've got to do that
[1:08:30] it's expected of you when you when you
[1:08:32] when you step into her presence or
[1:08:34] when you leave her presence and and how
[1:08:36] much more
[1:08:37] god how much more god
[1:08:40] we gotta we gotta learn we need to know
[1:08:42] how to approach god
[1:08:44] and here isaiah 66 1-2 i believe is the
[1:08:47] key it says
[1:08:48] thus saith the lord the heaven is my
[1:08:49] throne and the earth is my footstool
[1:08:52] where is the house that you build unto
[1:08:54] me and where is the place of my
[1:08:56] rest you know we see jesus saying come
[1:08:58] unto me all you that are
[1:08:59] heavy laden and i will give you rest and
[1:09:02] we want that rest but here god's talking
[1:09:04] about his rest where is the place of my
[1:09:07] rest
[1:09:08] where can i come and live where's my
[1:09:12] house
[1:09:13] all those things have have been handmade
[1:09:17] saith and those things have been saith
[1:09:19] the lord you see we can
[1:09:20] say well god we we made this sanctuary
[1:09:22] for you but he made everything here
[1:09:25] the trees that made the lumber and
[1:09:27] everything that came out of the ground
[1:09:28] god created his all these things have a
[1:09:30] my have my hand made
[1:09:32] where is a house that you build unto me
[1:09:38] think about that but to this man
[1:09:42] will i look he's looking to a house
[1:09:45] even to him that is poor and of a
[1:09:49] contrite spirit
[1:09:50] and trembleth at my word that's the kind
[1:09:53] of man and woman he's looking for
[1:09:56] humility amen real
[1:09:59] godly humility in first peter 5
[1:10:03] verses 4 and 7 4 7
[1:10:07] and when the chief shepherd shall appear
[1:10:09] ye shall receive a crown of glory
[1:10:12] that fadeth not away likewise you
[1:10:15] younger submit yourselves unto the elder
[1:10:18] yea all of you be subject one to another
[1:10:22] until we begin to do that we we don't
[1:10:23] know what true humility is
[1:10:26] the bible says in philippians uh
[1:10:29] look not every man on his own things but
[1:10:31] every man also
[1:10:32] on the things of others not to live and
[1:10:35] strive not to be envious
[1:10:37] but to love one another be subject one
[1:10:39] to another
[1:10:41] he says be subject one to another and be
[1:10:44] clothed
[1:10:45] with humility for god
[1:10:48] resisteth the proud and giveth grace
[1:10:51] unto the humble
[1:10:53] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:10:56] mighty hand of god
[1:10:58] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:11:02] casting all your cares upon him for he
[1:11:04] cares for you
[1:11:06] in the message thou knowest all things
[1:11:08] brother banham says
[1:11:09] now see what prayer does prayer is not
[1:11:13] exactly bringing god down to man
[1:11:15] and we always say well the presence of
[1:11:17] god just came down and
[1:11:19] and we say that and that's fine but
[1:11:22] brother bran says no it's not quite that
[1:11:24] way
[1:11:25] it's bringing man up to god
[1:11:29] see as you pray you lose
[1:11:32] you lose the sight of these earthly
[1:11:34] things he says
[1:11:36] you sway out into somewhere else wait
[1:11:38] i'm talking about breaking through now
[1:11:41] somewhere else way beyond and on and on
[1:11:44] and on till you till you come
[1:11:47] into his presence
[1:11:51] so what what happened is it's in it's in
[1:11:53] in heavenly places
[1:11:55] in christ jesus amen
[1:12:00] uh more scriptures on that james 4 7-10
[1:12:04] submit yourselves therefore to god
[1:12:06] resist the devil how about a whole
[1:12:08] uh uh some sermons just on this just on
[1:12:10] these these scriptures right here
[1:12:12] draw an eye to god and he will draw an
[1:12:15] eye to you we're expecting god to draw
[1:12:16] an eye to us
[1:12:17] but there's something we have to do
[1:12:19] there's a part we got to
[1:12:21] we we need us to humble ourselves god's
[1:12:24] not gonna give us everything in a silver
[1:12:26] platter
[1:12:26] he'll set up before us but we've got to
[1:12:28] reach forth and we've got to take it
[1:12:31] he says draw night to god he will draw
[1:12:33] an eye to you
[1:12:34] and then here it is cleanse your hands
[1:12:36] you sinners
[1:12:38] you and purify your hearts you
[1:12:40] double-minded
[1:12:42] the bible says that a double-minded man
[1:12:43] is unstable in all his ways
[1:12:46] if you're double-minded change your ways
[1:12:48] ask god to come and change you
[1:12:51] be stable stand that the bible says
[1:12:54] god's looking for people that are going
[1:12:55] to take a stand
[1:12:57] as it says here in the ephesians stand
[1:12:59] there for having your lawyers girl about
[1:13:01] with truth
[1:13:02] amen that you may be able to stand
[1:13:04] against the wiles of the devil
[1:13:07] we're to stand and face the enemy the
[1:13:09] armor is only on one side
[1:13:11] it's not on the back for for those that
[1:13:12] turn and run it's get
[1:13:14] only in the front we stand and we face
[1:13:17] the enemy
[1:13:18] amen glory to god we're in a war you
[1:13:21] know that don't you
[1:13:22] this is the conflict we're in
[1:13:25] be afflicted and mourn and weep
[1:13:30] let your laughter be turned to mourning
[1:13:32] and your joy to heaviness
[1:13:35] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[1:13:37] lord and what
[1:13:39] what will he do he will lift you up
[1:13:42] that's how we approach him in humility
[1:13:47] in humility just lord i'm nothing lord
[1:13:49] god i don't know
[1:13:50] lord i made a lot mess of my life lord
[1:13:54] help me god i don't know what to do will
[1:13:56] you just
[1:13:57] guide me will you just show me the way
[1:13:59] lord
[1:14:00] please lord i need you i don't know i
[1:14:03] don't know what to do i don't know where
[1:14:04] to turn
[1:14:06] come to him on a basis like that humble
[1:14:09] yourself
[1:14:11] approach unto him in humility to this
[1:14:14] man while i look
[1:14:16] even to him that is broken a contrite
[1:14:19] spirit amen of a broken heart
[1:14:23] one time brother branham was in the
[1:14:24] woods and and he went and he felt
[1:14:27] he wanted to talk to the lord he wanted
[1:14:29] to be in this presence and
[1:14:31] so he bowed his head and he's sitting on
[1:14:33] the stump i think and
[1:14:35] nothing happens and so then he he's by
[1:14:38] himself out there in the woods and
[1:14:40] he kneels down gets on his knees before
[1:14:43] god
[1:14:44] still nothing then he said he laid
[1:14:47] himself prostrate on the on the ground
[1:14:50] on the floor just laid himself out in
[1:14:53] just
[1:14:54] humility and immediately
[1:14:57] his presence he lifted him up into his
[1:15:00] presence
[1:15:01] we gotta know how to come in i'll come
[1:15:03] unto him
[1:15:05] in ephesians chapter two verse six
[1:15:08] and it raises up together and made us
[1:15:10] sit together in
[1:15:11] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:15:15] in the message perfect strength by
[1:15:18] perfect weakness
[1:15:19] in 61 he says i hope that gets down
[1:15:22] deep to us both here and the tape world
[1:15:26] too
[1:15:27] that you realize that you've got to
[1:15:29] become nothing
[1:15:32] not a know-it-all not a great somebody
[1:15:34] but a nobody
[1:15:37] you got to come to dust
[1:15:40] are you hearing me people you've got to
[1:15:42] get to a place
[1:15:44] that you know that you're nothing
[1:15:47] and don't never rise above it
[1:15:52] for as soon as you rise above it listen
[1:15:54] to this
[1:15:56] you rise above god
[1:15:59] that damascus rode dust
[1:16:03] that paul fell into brother brown said
[1:16:06] you got to lay there
[1:16:07] don't rise above it because the minute
[1:16:10] you rolls up above that dust

[1:17:18] shake with the power of the holy ghost
[1:17:21] that's the gospel that we believe that's
[1:17:24] the one we're following tonight

[1:18:40] amen talking about humility in these
[1:18:44] things i
[1:18:45] was reading one time a book i stole from
[1:18:47] my sister irma
[1:18:48] who's sitting back there she lent me a
[1:18:49] book and i'll tell you anything don't
[1:18:51] ever let me your books because i'll
[1:18:52] never give them back
[1:18:54] brother green was the same way i learned
[1:18:56] some of mine i never saw them again
[1:18:58] but he said he says here in this book
[1:19:00] written by frank bartleman in the sister
[1:19:02] street he says the whole place
[1:19:04] talking about that the the the the the
[1:19:08] the great visitation there in 1906
[1:19:12] the revival he says the whole place was
[1:19:14] steeped in prayer
[1:19:16] god was in his holy temple
[1:19:20] it was it was for a man to keep silent
[1:19:24] the chicano glory rested there
[1:19:27] in fact some claim to have seen the
[1:19:29] glory by night
[1:19:31] over the building brother larry
[1:19:34] i don't see him here tonight but he gave
[1:19:36] me a testimony back during that
[1:19:38] revival there was a little mission there
[1:19:40] in california
[1:19:42] where some believers had gathered to to
[1:19:44] to pray
[1:19:46] and the holy ghost came down inside that
[1:19:47] little building people on the outside
[1:19:50] saw the building they saw the pillar
[1:19:51] fire coming over that building they
[1:19:53] called the fire department
[1:19:54] to come put out the fire i'm talking
[1:19:58] about that kind of a book of accident
[1:19:59] man being written over again
[1:20:02] he said the whole place was steeped in
[1:20:04] praise i i have stopped
[1:20:06] he said there's a kind of glory rested
[1:20:08] there in fact something they've seen the
[1:20:10] glory by night over the building
[1:20:11] i do not doubt it i have stopped more
[1:20:14] than once within two blocks of the place
[1:20:16] and prayed for strength before i dared
[1:20:19] go on
[1:20:20] can you imagine having services like
[1:20:21] that before you come in here you'd stop
[1:20:24] and say oh god
[1:20:27] i'm coming to your presence lord help me
[1:20:33] i come in nonchalant chewing gum and
[1:20:35] talking about the thinking
[1:20:36] oh coming into the presence of jehovah
[1:20:40] lord god almighty creator of heavens and
[1:20:43] earth
[1:20:44] he says i'll be there amongst you two or
[1:20:46] three gather there i will be in your
[1:20:48] midst
[1:20:48] amen how many believe it tonight glory
[1:20:52] glory
[1:20:56] pray for strength before i go there go
[1:20:58] on the presence of the lord
[1:21:00] was so real presumptuous men would
[1:21:04] sometimes come among us especially
[1:21:07] preachers
[1:21:08] who would try to to spread themselves in
[1:21:10] self opinion
[1:21:12] but their effort was short-lived the
[1:21:15] breath would be taken from them
[1:21:17] their minds would wander their brains
[1:21:19] real
[1:21:20] things would turn black before their
[1:21:22] eyes they could not
[1:21:25] no one cut them off we simply
[1:21:28] prayed the holy spirit did the rest
[1:21:32] we wanted the spirit to control we
[1:21:35] he wound them up in short order they
[1:21:37] were carried out as dead
[1:21:39] spiritually speaking they generally bit
[1:21:42] the dust and humility
[1:21:44] going through the process we all had
[1:21:46] gone through
[1:21:47] in other words they died out came to see
[1:21:50] themselves
[1:21:51] in all their weakness then in childlike
[1:21:55] humility
[1:21:56] and confession were taken up of god
[1:21:59] transformed
[1:22:00] through the mighty baptism of the spirit
[1:22:03] the old man died with all his pride
[1:22:05] arrogancy
[1:22:06] and good works
[1:22:10] that's why the preachers died hard they
[1:22:11] had a lot of good works
[1:22:13] you know your own good works can hinder
[1:22:15] you
[1:22:16] did you know that i never understood
[1:22:19] that until i read this
[1:22:20] i put two and two together i said wow no
[1:22:22] wonder god says
[1:22:24] that our our most righteous deeds
[1:22:27] are as filthy rags i never could
[1:22:29] understand that how could our righteous
[1:22:31] deeds
[1:22:32] be filthy rags not that the deed
[1:22:35] is filthy but what it causes us
[1:22:38] to think in our mind of ourselves
[1:22:41] because we've done the good deed
[1:22:43] we began to think of ourselves as pretty
[1:22:46] good i'm pretty good guy
[1:22:48] i'm pretty good person look what i did
[1:22:50] you know that can hinder you
[1:22:53] you got to remain humble i hear the
[1:22:55] prophet of god with
[1:22:56] who stood in places for thou 10
[1:22:59] times times thousands were healed
[1:23:03] in one hour he was in meetings where ten
[1:23:06] thousand times thousands came to the
[1:23:09] lord
[1:23:09] and the saving grace of jesus in one
[1:23:12] meeting
[1:23:13] yet i hear him say here i am lord
[1:23:16] your unworthy servant
[1:23:20] your unworthy servant and that's what we
[1:23:22] are brothers
[1:23:24] we're unworthy we're unworthy to preach
[1:23:27] to the blood blood-bought saints of god
[1:23:31] we're unworthy amen may we never think
[1:23:35] that because of what we've done
[1:23:37] oh i've preached this and i've preached
[1:23:39] over there and i've done this
[1:23:40] that could be a hindrance to our life
[1:23:42] not not the deed
[1:23:44] how we perceive it in our own life can
[1:23:47] be a hindrance
[1:23:48] in our own life
[1:23:51] old men died with all this pride
[1:23:53] arrogance seeing good works
[1:23:55] in my own case i came to abhor myself
[1:23:59] i could never understand where jesus
[1:24:01] says
[1:24:03] in john chapter 12 verses 24 and 25
[1:24:07] verily verily i say unto you except the
[1:24:10] corn of wheat fall into the ground
[1:24:12] and die it abideth alone but if it die
[1:24:16] it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:24:19] and though we walk in and and oh and he
[1:24:22] that
[1:24:22] loveth his life shall lose it
[1:24:26] he that hateth his life
[1:24:29] in this world shall keep it unto eternal
[1:24:33] life and i never could understand
[1:24:35] that scripture how why would we have to
[1:24:37] hate
[1:24:38] our life and hear i hear this man say
[1:24:41] when they came into that presence
[1:24:43] and they began to see themselves began
[1:24:46] to abhor
[1:24:47] their own selves hate their own life
[1:24:51] in my prayer i've laid there sometimes i
[1:24:54] say god how can you even stand me
[1:24:57] so i i fought the battle all day long
[1:24:59] and i i try to
[1:25:01] be victorious and everything yet as i'm
[1:25:03] laying there
[1:25:04] in this presence these things come to me
[1:25:06] of things maybe i said or thought
[1:25:08] or whatever and i say lord how can you
[1:25:10] even stand me
[1:25:12] lord i begin to abhor myself my life
[1:25:16] i say god let me die out that's when we
[1:25:19] began to really realize
[1:25:21] we need a dying out we need the brother
[1:25:24] branson we need to die now for the
[1:25:25] pulpit
[1:25:26] clear out to the janitor's closet amen
[1:25:28] every one of us
[1:25:30] are included in that
[1:25:35] in my own case i came to abhor myself i
[1:25:37] begged the lord to drop
[1:25:39] a curtain so close behind me on my past
[1:25:43] that it would hit my heels amen i can
[1:25:46] say amen to that
[1:25:52] for though we walk in the flesh we wore
[1:25:55] not after the flesh
[1:25:57] for the weapons of our for the weapons
[1:26:00] of our warfare are not carnal but
[1:26:03] mighty through god the reason
[1:26:06] what's happened with us as christians
[1:26:08] many of us
[1:26:10] we've we no longer believe in prayer
[1:26:12] like we should
[1:26:18] that's the reason many many of us don't
[1:26:20] pray
[1:26:21] brother bryan said many christians don't
[1:26:22] even pray until they come into church
[1:26:27] you know we should always pray that the
[1:26:29] first scripture i gave always wherever
[1:26:31] we go
[1:26:32] there's that kind of a prayer where
[1:26:34] you'll be driving the road on the down
[1:26:36] the road now
[1:26:36] no brother erin driving down the road
[1:26:38] he's praying
[1:26:40] i do the same thing you do the same
[1:26:41] thing my sister might be washing the
[1:26:43] dishes doing your
[1:26:44] things around the house and you're in
[1:26:46] prayer
[1:26:47] but there's a different kind of prayer
[1:26:49] that that we need in our life
[1:26:52] and that's where jesus said when you go
[1:26:55] to your closet and you
[1:26:56] close the door behind you and you kneel
[1:27:00] down and
[1:27:01] you begin to look for his presence in
[1:27:03] that kind of prayer
[1:27:04] there's something about that prayer and
[1:27:07] what i want to say this this evening is
[1:27:09] that many of us have
[1:27:10] left prayer because we stopped believing
[1:27:13] in it
[1:27:14] brother branham said in the message
[1:27:16] greatest battle ever fought
[1:27:19] talking about the word of god and i'm
[1:27:21] have to i'm just going to skip around in
[1:27:23] my
[1:27:24] i've got it right here as a matter of
[1:27:25] fact here in the greatest battle of her
[1:27:27] father he says see his attack
[1:27:29] watch listen close this closing his
[1:27:32] attack is what
[1:27:33] disbelieving god's word not believing in
[1:27:37] the word of god
[1:27:38] see that's his attack there you can see
[1:27:40] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:27:42] there's only two forces satan and god
[1:27:45] and what is satan's weapon against you
[1:27:47] listen to this though
[1:27:48] what is satan's weapon against you you
[1:27:51] know brother branson said
[1:27:52] a baxter against and he he studies the
[1:27:54] tactic of of his opponent whether he's a
[1:27:56] southpaw
[1:27:57] how he fights is he a boxer is you're
[1:27:59] just a man just
[1:28:00] burrows in he studies his tactics we
[1:28:03] need to study
[1:28:04] the tactics of our enemy and brother
[1:28:06] brandon said you see his tactics
[1:28:08] he says what what is satan's weapon
[1:28:10] against you
[1:28:11] is to try to get you to disbelieve your
[1:28:14] weapon
[1:28:16] are you hearing me tonight we're talking
[1:28:18] about prayer
[1:28:20] brother obama's you're talking about the
[1:28:21] word of god but that applies to our
[1:28:23] prayer as well
[1:28:24] he's gotten us to disbelieve that our
[1:28:27] prayer
[1:28:28] is any good because if we believe
[1:28:31] truly believed in prayer every one of us
[1:28:33] would be prayer warriors tonight
[1:28:36] you see we spend more time in prayer
[1:28:39] than
[1:28:40] anything else in our life he gets you to
[1:28:43] disbelieve that weapon
[1:28:45] is to try to disbelieve your weapon he
[1:28:47] disarms you
[1:28:49] he lis let's listen real quiet now
[1:28:52] listen he says
[1:28:53] if he if he can get you to disbelieve
[1:28:55] your weapon is equivalent
[1:28:57] if he can get you to believe that your
[1:28:59] weapon is not strong enough
[1:29:02] your prayer not strong enough he has
[1:29:05] disarmed you

[1:29:10] never leave that
[1:29:12] i hope and pray not look he's disarmed
[1:29:16] you
[1:29:16] and when he gets you to disbelieve that
[1:29:19] weapon
[1:29:20] when you lay down lay that down that
[1:29:22] finishes your fight
[1:29:24] you're done hold that weapon
[1:29:29] don't lay it down talk about the weapon

[1:29:36] and you and you slash that devil

[1:29:47] and you whack him again and you whack
[1:29:49] him again by his stripes i am healed
[1:29:52] by his strength he's a healer of all of
[1:29:54] my diseases

[1:30:07] anything to the devil oh
[1:30:08] your way your head does it makes them
[1:30:10] back up he said you cut that devil to
[1:30:12] pieces
[1:30:13] and after you're done with that devil

[1:33:31] can i get a witness on that flesh don't
[1:33:33] want to pray
[1:33:35] flesh don't want to serve god flesh
[1:33:38] don't want to witness
[1:33:40] flesh don't want to do any of that amen
[1:33:42] it takes the spirit of god in us
[1:33:44] but we've got to surrender to that
[1:33:45] spirit to have the power and the
[1:33:47] strength to overcome
[1:33:48] this one right here when you stand there
[1:33:51] in the mirror in the morning
[1:33:53] especially your brother's a shave in the
[1:33:55] morning you're looking at your worst
[1:33:57] enemy right there
[1:33:58] he's staring back at you that old flesh
[1:34:02] you gotta you gotta you've got you've
[1:34:03] gotta dominate that flesh by the holy
[1:34:04] ghost
[1:34:05] amen jesus said when you pray
[1:34:09] pray or pray that you enter not into
[1:34:16] temptation
[1:34:18] and joel almost isn't finishing now
[1:34:20] almost four minutes here
[1:34:22] well not really he said to take my
[1:34:26] liberties so you can blame brother
[1:34:30] daniel
[1:34:32] in joel chapter 2 verse 12 through 19
[1:34:38] says therefore also now saith the lord
[1:34:40] turn ye
[1:34:41] even to me with all your heart and with
[1:34:44] fasting
[1:34:46] and with weeping why does it always say
[1:34:48] that
[1:34:49] why is it what is this about the
[1:34:50] mourning and the weeping
[1:34:53] and the heavy heart having our joy turn
[1:34:56] to heaviness
[1:34:58] what is it we're crying out because we
[1:35:01] know
[1:35:02] if the more spiritual you'll get the
[1:35:04] more you begin to realize
[1:35:06] how what kind of a fight you got ahead
[1:35:08] of you and how hard it is
[1:35:11] and we come before him weeping and
[1:35:13] crying saying lord help me
[1:35:15] i want to overcome this flesh i want to
[1:35:18] be an overcomer lord
[1:35:21] we come with fasting i preached a very
[1:35:25] very difficult message
[1:35:26] a few weeks ago and i and i said this
[1:35:30] i heard brother green say this one time
[1:35:31] he said
[1:35:33] what did you invest in the service
[1:35:37] tonight what was your investment was it
[1:35:42] more than just getting ready
[1:35:44] putting on the shirt and the tie and
[1:35:45] picking the right blouse and the right
[1:35:47] shoes go with this with a dress and
[1:35:50] comb your hair and or were you preparing
[1:35:53] the inner man
[1:35:55] to come to service what did you invest
[1:35:58] this this evening
[1:36:00] and i came and i saw brother daniel on
[1:36:02] his knees are praying there
[1:36:03] with all his heart and he's making an
[1:36:06] investment
[1:36:07] we need to start making investments in
[1:36:10] the service
[1:36:12] as believers we're not children anymore
[1:36:18] amen you know children they give them
[1:36:20] they have to give them milk
[1:36:23] we should be coming the coming of age
[1:36:27] there's a maturity that's going to come
[1:36:29] to us as believers
[1:36:31] i've seen people serving 30 years god's
[1:36:34] 30 40 years
[1:36:35] and they're still babes in christ they
[1:36:38] never grew
[1:36:39] they never matured there's got to be a
[1:36:42] maturity in us
[1:36:44] and it comes from the through the
[1:36:45] battles that we fight
[1:36:48] when we lay on our knees before god all
[1:36:50] night and i said how many how many have
[1:36:52] ever prayed all night when was the last
[1:36:55] time you fasted three days
[1:36:58] when was the last time you went out and
[1:37:00] witnessed what was the last person that
[1:37:01] you ever brought to the foot of the
[1:37:03] cross
[1:37:03] through your witness scene well that's a
[1:37:06] pastor's job no
[1:37:08] it's all our jobs you see
[1:37:12] there are so many things that we fall
[1:37:13] short on
[1:37:15] but i believe we get everything
[1:37:17] everything straight in our lives and we
[1:37:19] begin to come
[1:37:20] back to a life of prayer
[1:37:23] amen we're going to have it it's to live
[1:37:26] a life of
[1:37:26] a victory to be an overcomer of this age
[1:37:31] this is the most over deceiving age has
[1:37:33] ever been
[1:37:35] amen we are we are to be we should be
[1:37:39] matured by now brother branstad i just
[1:37:41] gave that quote
[1:37:41] we should be so far along right now and
[1:37:44] we're not
[1:37:46] because our every maturity we don't
[1:37:49] learn
[1:37:51] we've got to learn
[1:37:54] let the holy spirit begin to teach us
[1:37:57] amen
[1:37:58] how to be a strong christian
[1:38:02] how to learn how to fight our battles up
[1:38:04] on our knees
[1:38:06] but the man said we need that more
[1:38:07] theology we need more neology
[1:38:11] be on our knees before god
[1:38:16] joel verse 13 says rend your heart
[1:38:20] and not your garments and turn unto the
[1:38:23] lord your god
[1:38:25] for he is gracious and merciful slow
[1:38:28] to anger and of great kindness
[1:38:31] and repented him of the evil in the
[1:38:34] message desperations brother brown says
[1:38:37] desperation signs of his coming should
[1:38:39] throw every member of christ
[1:38:41] into desperation now
[1:38:45] about our souls about our welfare for
[1:38:47] hereafter
[1:38:49] well what are we going to do to amount
[1:38:52] what are we going to amount to if we
[1:38:55] gain the whole world what are we what
[1:38:58] are we living
[1:38:59] for what that's a good question what are
[1:39:02] we living for
[1:39:06] what do you work for what are you eating
[1:39:09] for
[1:39:10] what are you struggling for to live
[1:39:15] what are you living for to die
[1:39:18] and you're not fit to live until you're
[1:39:20] fit to die
[1:39:23] it's true
[1:39:27] there's a time to weep in a time
[1:39:31] to laugh a time to mourn the bible says
[1:39:36] a time to dance we're in a time right
[1:39:39] now
[1:39:40] of mourning crying out
[1:39:44] we have loved ones that aren't saved
[1:39:47] there are those around us some are in
[1:39:49] need
[1:39:51] and we're still struggling because we
[1:39:55] don't
[1:39:56] sacrifice paul said in
[1:39:59] romans chapter 12 verse one he says i
[1:40:03] beseech you
[1:40:05] i beg of you i ask you
[1:40:08] please present your bodies
[1:40:12] a living sacrifice they used to bring
[1:40:15] the sacrifice in their arms
[1:40:18] to the priests and they laid upon the
[1:40:20] altar
[1:40:22] and the priest would take that knife and
[1:40:24] he'd slit that animal's throat
[1:40:26] and the little animal began to kick
[1:40:28] because they wanted to live
[1:40:30] and the blood began to spurt out all
[1:40:33] over the
[1:40:34] believer blood everywhere
[1:40:38] he would bring a sacrifice but now we
[1:40:40] come to the altar this is
[1:40:42] an altar we come to the altar
[1:40:46] we're not bringing a sacrifice we are
[1:40:49] the sacrifice you are the sacrifice
[1:40:54] you're coming here to die that's what an
[1:40:56] altar is for that's where you die
[1:40:59] you lay there you die in that dust
[1:41:03] amen you lay there in that door you stay
[1:41:06] there don't ever get up
[1:41:08] you of course you have to get up from
[1:41:09] this place but in your heart
[1:41:12] in your spirit in your experience
[1:41:15] don't ever rise above that damascus road
[1:41:17] dust
[1:41:18] remain there in humility dying out to
[1:41:21] yourself
[1:41:22] amen disciplining your life in the
[1:41:25] message blind bartimaeus in
[1:41:27] 57 brother brandon says you know there's
[1:41:31] something about getting alone to
[1:41:32] yourself
[1:41:34] many people never pray until they come
[1:41:37] to church
[1:41:38] many people think that's the only place
[1:41:40] to praise the church
[1:41:41] but the bible said for men to pray
[1:41:43] everywhere lifting up holy hands
[1:41:46] and then we when we get to by ourself
[1:41:49] we're usually we'll usually pray
[1:41:52] different than we would
[1:41:54] if we prayed in church it's a secret
[1:41:57] prayer
[1:41:58] that jesus spoke of saying enter ye
[1:42:01] into the secret closet and close
[1:42:04] the door and when you have
[1:42:08] did so pray to your father who sees in
[1:42:10] secret
[1:42:11] and he that seeth in secret shall reward
[1:42:13] you openly
[1:42:15] and when we're when we're praying like
[1:42:17] that there seems to be something to the
[1:42:19] prayer
[1:42:20] that takes all the hypocrisy out of it
[1:42:24] it seems like it we get it in a better
[1:42:27] connection with god
[1:42:30] to get alone
[1:42:33] and there's been many times in my life
[1:42:36] brother bram talking
[1:42:37] saying this as perhaps in your life
[1:42:41] that you just have to get alone once in
[1:42:43] a while with jesus
[1:42:44] i took my car and drove down the road
[1:42:47] and just studying and
[1:42:48] after i got to the highway where it was
[1:42:50] free
[1:42:51] or often some country road until i would
[1:42:53] become so
[1:42:54] filled with his mercies and goodness
[1:42:56] till i just stopped the car
[1:42:58] and held the wheel and wept like a baby
[1:43:02] in the presence
[1:43:08] of
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:22] troubles vanish
[1:43:26] my heart is mended
[1:43:31] some of us need that in
[1:43:35] the presence of
[1:43:39] the king amen
[1:43:44] goes on he says that being alone
[1:43:48] many times i've climbed up into the
[1:43:50] mountains
[1:43:52] where every man thought was with me i
[1:43:55] was going hunting
[1:43:57] go up there and sit down on a rock and
[1:43:58] just look up to the sky
[1:44:01] until i looked like my whole innermost
[1:44:03] being become filled
[1:44:05] with something that you could just feel
[1:44:08] oh everything of the world seemed to
[1:44:10] pass away
[1:44:12] oh for those precious hours alone
[1:44:15] with god oh it's there that
[1:44:19] when the greatest revelation and
[1:44:21] inspiration
[1:44:23] comes is when we're alone
[1:44:27] with god we take more time
[1:44:31] on that i'm sure that we would live a
[1:44:34] better life
[1:44:35] more victorious in christ
[1:44:39] this is how i fight my battles
[1:44:42] when you kneel down early in the morning
[1:44:45] before you go to work before you go to
[1:44:47] school
[1:44:49] take that extra time take an hour
[1:44:52] whatever you can take
[1:44:53] so you can read your bible alone
[1:44:57] pray get on your knees and prepare your
[1:44:59] heart
[1:45:00] because you're going to step out that
[1:45:01] door and satan will be waiting for you
[1:45:04] right there
[1:45:05] the battle will begin but you've already
[1:45:08] won your battle
[1:45:09] if you laid before god in prayer that's
[1:45:12] your strength amen
[1:45:14] and before i turn it over brother daniel
[1:45:17] i'd like to give just a couple of quotes
[1:45:20] on brother branham
[1:45:22] a few quotes here in expectation 1950
[1:45:24] says prayer that i depend on
[1:45:27] that's the secret of all the mysteries
[1:45:28] of god
[1:45:30] that's the key that opens the door to
[1:45:32] everything of god
[1:45:33] is prayer if you pray and believe
[1:45:36] when you pray then believe that you will
[1:45:38] receive what you have asked for
[1:45:40] and god will make it known and believing
[1:45:43] god 1952
[1:45:45] so therefore that's the reason said the
[1:45:47] prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:45:49] an individual's prayer the effectual
[1:45:52] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:45:54] availeth much oh if you only knew that
[1:45:56] in your hand
[1:45:58] christ gave us the authority with his
[1:46:00] name
[1:46:01] by being christians the most powerful
[1:46:03] weapon
[1:46:04] the world has ever known prayer it even
[1:46:07] changes everything
[1:46:08] it will change the mind of god
[1:46:12] my angel shall go before thee 53. the
[1:46:15] christian doesn't realize what a force
[1:46:18] he has when he kneels on his knees
[1:46:21] before almighty god in the name of jesus
[1:46:23] christ
[1:46:24] he doesn't realize what power
[1:46:27] that is do you now believe 53
[1:46:32] prayer is the most powerful weapon was
[1:46:35] ever put in the hand of mankind
[1:46:38] believe us all this 1950 if we fail to
[1:46:41] pray
[1:46:42] through daily and i want you to listen
[1:46:44] to this one this is very important
[1:46:46] if we fail to pray through daily
[1:46:50] all the time keep under the blood
[1:46:54] you'll wither up and die in your
[1:46:57] christian experience
[1:46:59] too many people are running on empty
[1:47:05] too many christians too many passage
[1:47:07] people are drained
[1:47:09] spiritually and they're running they're
[1:47:11] going through the motions
[1:47:13] they're coming to church they sing the
[1:47:16] songs
[1:47:17] but they're empty on the inside
[1:47:20] you don't have to stay that way tonight

[1:48:45] mistakes

[2:04:59] gifts and mend them so close together
[2:05:02] brother robert the things we've been
[2:05:04] talking about i think it was wednesday
[2:05:06] talking about our weapons
[2:05:07] the word of god and prayer being our
[2:05:10] weapons
[2:05:11] i was thinking about that the effectual
[2:05:12] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[2:05:14] avails much james 5. no matter what the
[2:05:16] devil says
[2:05:18] your prayer avails much he said we
[2:05:21] shouldn't be like children anymore
[2:05:23] babies but we should be growing
[2:05:24] growing up amen god help us to grow up
[2:05:27] some of us
[2:05:28] well they say little children don't
[2:05:29] drink coffee it'll stunt your growth

[2:05:46] a little boy that'll stun his growth how
[2:05:48] much we as christians ought to say lord
[2:05:50] i'm not getting involved in that that'll
[2:05:52] stunt my growth as a christian and then

[2:05:57] we brought a time to laugh a time to
[2:05:58] weep amen god just

[2:06:06] musicians and the
[2:06:07] song leader they get together in the
[2:06:08] back and they pray together and say lord
[2:06:11] merge our spirits together then the song
[2:06:13] leader comes over and we pray there and
[2:06:15] say lord let it just not one gift it's

[2:06:21] that's with the special songs i didn't
[2:06:23] get that this morning now
[2:06:24] it's just not the minister is anointed

[2:06:28] anointing's in the people and you say
[2:06:29] god put this song in my heart we open a
[2:06:31] little special

[2:06:43] communion service amen let's just have a
[2:06:45] word of prayer

[2:06:56] to the communion

[2:07:00] as we have appreciated the word tonight
[2:07:03] it's touched our hearts and
[2:07:05] lord we just pray god that the word
[2:07:06] that's been spoken would go deep
[2:07:08] father the prayer life i pray that you
[2:07:10] would help us i was thinking of psalms
[2:07:13] 91 david said thou art my god and early
[2:07:16] will i
[2:07:17] seek thee help us lord early in the
[2:07:19] morning before the thoughts of the day
[2:07:21] and
[2:07:22] social media and all those thoughts come
[2:07:24] into our minds help us to seek you and
[2:07:26] read our bibles and pray
[2:07:28] lord while our mind which is a fertile
[2:07:30] ground in the morning when it's fresh
[2:07:33] help us to put good thoughts in it as
[2:07:35] our brother robert
[2:07:36] has encouraged us to read our bibles and
[2:07:38] to pray and take time to put good
[2:07:40] thoughts in our
[2:07:41] garden of our mind that they might grow
[2:07:43] during the day help us lord
[2:07:45] lord as we change the communion service
[2:07:48] lord a time to commune and communicate
[2:07:50] and fellowship with you i pray that you
[2:07:52] would bless this time lord
[2:07:54] we ask it in the name of jesus christ
[2:07:56] amen
[2:07:58] if you have your bibles we'll just read
[2:08:00] psalm corinthians
[2:08:02] chapter 11 first corinthians chapter 11.
[2:08:08] amen
[2:08:17] paul says here in first corinthians
[2:08:19] chapter 11 verse 23
[2:08:22] talking about the communion
[2:08:26] he said for i received the lord that
[2:08:28] which also i delivered unto you
[2:08:30] that the lord jesus the same night in
[2:08:32] which he was betrayed took
[2:08:33] bread and when he had given thanks he
[2:08:36] break it and said take e
[2:08:38] this is my body which is broken for you
[2:08:40] this endue
[2:08:42] in remembrance of me after the same
[2:08:44] manner also he took the cup
[2:08:46] and when he had sucked saying this cup
[2:08:48] is the new testament in my blood
[2:08:50] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[2:08:53] remembrances
[2:08:54] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[2:08:56] and drink this cup you do show the
[2:08:58] lord's death
[2:08:59] until he come wherefore whosoever shall
[2:09:02] eat this bread and drink of this
[2:09:04] cup unworthily shall be guilty of the
[2:09:06] body and the blood of the lord
[2:09:08] but let a man examine himself
[2:09:11] and so let him eat of that bread and
[2:09:13] drink of that cup he that eateth and
[2:09:15] drinketh
[2:09:15] unworth worthily eateth and drink a
[2:09:18] damnation to himself not discerning the
[2:09:20] lord's body
[2:09:22] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:09:24] among you and many sleep
[2:09:26] for if you we would judge ourselves we
[2:09:28] should not be judged but when we are
[2:09:30] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[2:09:32] we should not
[2:09:33] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[2:09:36] brethren when you come together to eat
[2:09:37] terry
[2:09:38] it means to wait for one another terry
[2:09:41] one for another
[2:09:43] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[2:09:44] home that ye come not together unto
[2:09:47] condemnation
[2:09:48] and the rest will i set an order when i
[2:09:51] come
[2:09:52] amen we're just going to change the
[2:09:54] order of the service now if the brothers
[2:09:56] will come and
[2:09:57] we'll prepare to take the communion
[2:10:01] and what we've done if brother
[2:10:06] brother ed will usher you down as many
[2:10:09] people as we can in the front
[2:10:11] and then we have the bread and the wine
[2:10:12] and i know we've done it a little
[2:10:14] different in the past maybe with one cup
[2:10:17] i think brother random's done it both
[2:10:18] ways individual cups
[2:10:20] and with the one cup tonight we're going
[2:10:23] to have it with the individual cups just
[2:10:25] trying to be cautious with the
[2:10:27] pandemic and so if you just come whether
[2:10:30] ed will
[2:10:31] usher you up and then if you'll just
[2:10:32] come and brother arnie will
[2:10:34] serve the bread across and then brother
[2:10:37] aaron will serve the wine across
[2:10:39] amen we'll just pray over the sacraments
[2:10:41] at this time
[2:10:43] isn't it good to be in god's house and
[2:10:44] take communion
[2:10:46] amen jesus said this do and remembers me
[2:10:48] until i come
[2:10:50] now we know christ came in word for him
[2:10:52] when we understand the son of man
[2:10:54] appearing that he appeared but he said
[2:10:56] he's going to come again and catch us
[2:10:57] away and
[2:10:58] my feet are still on the ground so amen
[2:11:01] we still got to do this until he comes
[2:11:02] that's what the bible says
[2:11:04] amen let's pray over this this bread
[2:11:07] first
[2:11:09] heavenly father i hold in my hands this
[2:11:12] bread
[2:11:13] lord that has been made by human hands
[2:11:16] and now we just sanctify it lord to your
[2:11:19] use
[2:11:20] to the communion service lord it's made
[2:11:23] unleavened father it's
[2:11:24] there's no leaven of the world in it
[2:11:26] father and as we come to you

[2:11:35] mistakes knowing there's none righteous
[2:11:37] among you for us father but

[2:11:46] broken for you lord
[2:11:48] in a communion time lord our lives

[2:11:52] will our mind broken father not
[2:11:55] our will let your will be done and as we
[2:11:57] commune in this
[2:11:58] lord i pray there will be a true
[2:11:59] communion father maybe some here
[2:12:02] come from a broken family and others
[2:12:04] made a decision not to serve you and
[2:12:06] they
[2:12:06] have a broken life today lord and i pray
[2:12:09] god you would just
[2:12:10] bless them there would be a time of
[2:12:11] fellowship father with you and
[2:12:13] i pray you bless this bread and sanctify

[2:28:26] and the joy we
[2:28:29] share as we tear
[2:28:44] amen let's stand together saint john
[2:28:47] chapter 13
[2:28:48] verse 2. this is the
[2:28:51] scripture of the foot washing
[2:28:57] st john chapter 13 verse 2
[2:29:00] aren't you glad that everything that you
[2:29:02] do comes from the bible
[2:29:04] jesus only gave us three ordinance water
[2:29:06] baptism
[2:29:07] communion and foot washing that we had
[2:29:09] to do
[2:29:11] verse number two and supper being ended
[2:29:13] the devil having now put into the heart
[2:29:15] of judas iscariot simon's son to betray
[2:29:18] him
[2:29:19] and jesus knowing that the father had
[2:29:20] given all things into his hand
[2:29:22] that he was come from god and went to
[2:29:25] god he rises from supper and laid aside
[2:29:27] his garments
[2:29:28] and took a towel and girded himself
[2:29:31] after that he poured water into a basin
[2:29:33] and began to wash his disciples feet to
[2:29:36] wash them with the towel wherewith he
[2:29:37] was disguised
[2:29:40] then cometh he to simon peter and peter
[2:29:42] said that him lord dost thou wash my
[2:29:44] feet
[2:29:45] jesus answered and said unto him what i
[2:29:47] do thou knowest not now but thou shalt
[2:29:49] know hereafter
[2:29:51] simon sayeth unto him thou shalt never
[2:29:53] wash my feet
[2:29:54] you know you learn there you never say
[2:29:56] never
[2:29:58] never say never peter said you're never
[2:30:01] i'm never you're never gonna wash my
[2:30:03] feet jesus answer him if i wash thee not
[2:30:06] thou has no part with me
[2:30:08] now peter expressed what a true son or
[2:30:10] daughter of god when the word corrects
[2:30:12] you his reaction to that was lord
[2:30:15] simon peter saith the name lord not my
[2:30:18] feet only but also my hands and my head
[2:30:21] amen whatever the word of god ask you to
[2:30:23] do let's do it verse number 10
[2:30:25] jesus saith unto him he that is washed
[2:30:27] needeth not saved to wash his feet
[2:30:29] but is clean every wit and year clean
[2:30:32] but not all
[2:30:33] for he knew who should betray him
[2:30:35] therefore said he you are not all clean
[2:30:38] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:30:41] had taken his garments and was set down
[2:30:43] again he
[2:30:43] said unto them know ye what i have done
[2:30:46] to you
[2:30:47] you call me master and lord and you say
[2:30:49] well for so i
[2:30:50] am if i then your lord and master have
[2:30:52] washed your feet
[2:30:55] you also ought to wash one another's
[2:30:57] feet
[2:30:59] now when your master says you ought to
[2:31:00] do this parent tells your child you
[2:31:03] ought to take the trash out
[2:31:05] hey you need to take some vitamins jesus
[2:31:08] is saying here
[2:31:09] you ought to wash one another's feet i
[2:31:11] believe as christians we ought to do it
[2:31:13] don't you think
[2:31:15] so what about people that don't take the
[2:31:16] communion told peter said you don't have
[2:31:18] any part with me
[2:31:20] and he told him you ought to do this you
[2:31:22] ought to do this
[2:31:23] as a minister of the gospel he said you
[2:31:25] ought to be washing feet you ought to be
[2:31:26] part of the communion service
[2:31:28] verse number 15 for i have given you an
[2:31:31] example that you should do as i have
[2:31:32] done to you
[2:31:34] verily i say unto you the servant is not
[2:31:36] greater than his lord neither he that is
[2:31:38] sent greater than he that sent him
[2:31:40] if you know these things happy are ye
[2:31:43] if you do them amen
[2:31:46] praise the lord as we change the order
[2:31:48] of the service and
[2:31:49] we just go to the communion maybe we
[2:31:52] just
[2:31:53] not have it preset that the sisters
[2:31:55] would be downstairs in the room here the
[2:31:56] brothers will
[2:31:57] go upstairs go through the hallway and
[2:31:59] come to the uh
[2:32:00] the chapel area there we just ask that
[2:32:02] all the brothers would go there whether
[2:32:04] you're taking the communion or not if
[2:32:05] you'll just gather there to be good time
[2:32:07] to be together
[2:32:08] not a time of fellowship but just a time
[2:32:10] to wash one another's feet
[2:32:12] and we as the brothers we tarry one for
[2:32:14] another we have the foot washing and
