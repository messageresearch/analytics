[6:01] [Music]
[6:27] verse one. Brother Tim,
[6:38] there's a light in the window.
[6:42] It's okay. We can clap our hands for a
[6:44] little bit while they get the lyrics
[6:45] going.
[6:58] Oh, there's a light in the window.
[7:04] Table spread in splendor.
[7:08] Someone standing by the open door.
[7:15] Oh, I can see the crystal river. And I
[7:21] must be near forever.
[7:24] Lord, I've never been this home sick
[7:29] before.
[7:32] Oh, see the bright light shine.
[7:37] It's just about home time.
[7:42] I can see my father standing
[7:46] at the door.
[7:49] This old world has been a wilderness.
[7:54] I'm ready for deliverance.
[7:59] Lord, I've never been this homesick
[8:04] before. Verse two.
[8:07] I can see the family gathered.
[8:13] Faces are familiar,
[8:16] but no one's old or feeble
[8:20] anymore.
[8:23] Oh, this old lonesome hearts are crying.
[8:28] I think I'll spread my wings for flying.

[9:11] before. Sing. What a day that will be.

[9:19] Each saint in victory,
[9:24] walking through those gates forever
[9:28] more.
[9:29] Hallelujah. Oh, as we greet one another,
[9:36] every sister, every brother. Lord, I've
[9:41] never been this home sick before.
[9:47] I see the bright light shine.
[9:52] It's just about home time.
[9:56] I can see my father standing
[10:01] at the door.
[10:04] This old world has been a wilderness.
[10:08] I'm ready for deliverance.
[10:13] Lord, I've never been this home sick
[10:18] before. Sing. I see the bright light
[10:19] shine again. I see the bright light
[10:23] shine.

[10:40] [Music]
[10:42] I'm ready for deliverance.
[10:46] And Lord, I've never been this home sick
[10:51] before.
[10:53] Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of
[10:56] praise this morning.
[11:00] Can someone say praise the Lord? Can
[11:03] someone say hallelujah?
[11:05] Amen. Our hope is in the Lord this
[11:08] morning. My hope is in the Lord. We're
[11:10] going to sing that.
[11:12] Let's just worship him. There's no other
[11:14] place to put our hope or trust but in
[11:16] him this morning. Let's sing this song
[11:18] and dedicate it to the Lord.
[11:22] Oh
[11:24] my hope
[11:28] is in the Lord
[11:32] from this time on
[11:36] and ever more.
[11:40] Oh,
[11:42] my hope
[11:45] is in the Lord
[11:49] forever
[11:51] more. Let's sing verse one.
[11:57] I stand in awe within the presence of
[12:03] the Lord.
[12:06] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[12:11] lies.
[12:14] For whom the raging of the seas
[12:19] subsides.
[12:22] The living sacrifice.
[12:27] The only source
[12:29] of life.
[12:32] My hope
[12:35] is in the Lord
[12:39] from this time on
[12:43] and ever more.
[12:47] Oh my hope
[12:50] [Music]
[12:51] is in the Lord
[12:55] forever more. His tender mercies
[13:00] His
[13:04] tender mercies come with every rising
[13:09] sun
[13:11] to meet the sinner in his brokenness.
[13:16] [Music]
[13:19] To offer healing and forgiveness.
[13:27] Oh, and those who trust
[13:30] in him will find their hearts
[13:34] at rest.
[13:36] My hope
[13:39] is in the Lord.
[13:43] From this time on
[13:47] and ever more.
[13:51] Oh, my hope
[13:55] is in the Lord
[13:59] forever more. Sing it again. My hope is
[14:02] in the Lord.
[14:04] Oh yes, my hope
[14:09] is in the Lord
[14:13] from this time on
[14:17] and ever more.
[14:20] Oh, my hope
[14:24] is in the Lord
[14:29] forever more.
[14:34] Brother Ed, Brother Arie, and the
[14:35] brothers would come forward now to open
[14:38] the service in prayer. Key of D.
[14:43] I know there's people here with needs
[14:44] this morning. God will make a way for
[14:48] you.
[14:51] God will make a way
[14:56] where there seems to be no way.
[15:02] He works in ways we cannot see.
[15:08] He will make a way for me.
[15:13] He will be my guide.
[15:18] Hold me closely to his side
[15:23] with love and strength for each new day.
[15:29] He will make a way.
[15:34] God will make a way. Let's sing that
[15:37] again as brother Ed comes.
[15:39] God will make a way
[15:44] where there seems to be no way.
[15:50] He works in ways we cannot see.
[15:55] He will make a way for me.
[16:00] He will be my guide.
[16:05] Hold me closely to his side.
[16:10] with love and strength for each new day.
[16:16] He will make a way.
[16:21] God will make a way.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Before we go to the praise and prayer
[16:30] requests, just a little bit of church
[16:32] business,
[16:33] just to give you a little update. You
[16:35] can see we have the little wings here uh
[16:37] that been installed. And we will be
[16:39] installing some
[16:42] cultured stone or dry dry stone here in
[16:44] the near future.
[16:47] The rear window for the nursery has been
[16:49] installed. So, we'll be moving into the
[16:51] the nursery to do some work there.
[16:54] And then the wood here uh that was up uh
[16:58] has been stained and uh sealed and that
[17:01] should be going up here in the near
[17:03] future along with the carpet being
[17:05] installed within the next week or two.
[17:07] So, just to give you a little you folks
[17:09] a little update. Uh pray for the pray
[17:13] for us that are doing this. It's there's
[17:15] a lot of logistics going into
[17:17] everything. So, we truly would
[17:18] appreciate all your prayers. Uh start
[17:21] off with some of the praise. I'd like to
[17:24] give God praise that you brought brother
[17:27] Jordan's sister Martha and the family
[17:30] home. It's good to see them.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Lionel, Sister Lonnie, welcome
[17:34] back. It's it's a blessing to have you
[17:37] back in our midst and I know you were a
[17:38] blessing um up there on the fire line.
[17:42] So, it's good to have you back and I'm
[17:44] glad God kept you safe. Um
[17:48] the praise from Sister
[17:51] Lonnie and brother Lionel. We want to
[17:53] thank everyone for their prayers. We
[17:55] while we were up on uh working on the
[17:58] fire uh line up north, God was using us
[18:02] to pray for many people. everything from
[18:04] some lady's son's appendix bursting.
[18:08] They were able uh they thought he would
[18:10] die, but after prayer, he went home the
[18:13] very next day. So, we're thankful to
[18:15] God.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; God still answers prayer.
[18:22] And if you think you got to be somebody
[18:24] really special with all sorts of uh
[18:26] spiritual, no, it it just it's faith.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; That's all it is. It's faith.
[18:33] where two or three are gathered in his
[18:35] name, the presence of the Lord is still
[18:38] there.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Um there was a also in this praise uh
[18:44] there was a firefighter firefighter
[18:46] wanting to commit suicide, kill himself.
[18:49] Now he says he wants and needs more of
[18:52] Jesus. So please please pray for all
[18:56] those still on on the fire line up
[18:58] there. So, I know it is a dangerous
[19:01] business. So, I want to remember all
[19:03] those that are putting their life on the
[19:05] line. I have uh two requests. Uh
[19:10] our daughter Ruth is due to have surgery
[19:13] tomorrow to have a thyroid removed and
[19:16] she wants and needs uh the prayers of
[19:19] the brothers and sisters here that
[19:21] everything will go well and that God
[19:24] will use um guide the doctor's hands.
[19:28] And our son Nate has asked prayers
[19:30] concerning some unspoken needs where
[19:33] he's at. Sister Rachel Gara
[19:37] turns in a request. Please remember her
[19:40] sister uh Elizabeth in prayer. She's not
[19:43] feeling well. Also pray for my
[19:45] mother-in-law,
[19:47] Sister Meline. She's going to have a
[19:49] procedure done on her leg tomorrow
[19:51] morning. Pray all goes well and she
[19:54] recovers quickly. Thank you for praying.
[20:02] Got uh another request here. I don't
[20:04] know who it's from.
[20:06] Uh
[20:08] please pray for brother Sal Curillo. Um
[20:13] I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[20:15] He was feeling stomach pain. He went to
[20:17] the hospital and was told he needed open
[20:20] heart surgery. He has three blocked uh
[20:23] veins that are 90% blocked. So let's
[20:26] remember this. this person, God can
[20:30] still
[20:31] um he can do an absolute miracle, open
[20:34] everything up, or he can use the
[20:36] doctor's hands. And I believe honestly
[20:39] doctors are here to help God's children.
[20:44] And then brother um Kalahano
[20:47] Salazar uh writes a request. I have a
[20:50] friend who got in trouble and shot a
[20:52] woman. I know he has a good heart and a
[20:55] one-year-old boy. We are not sure what
[20:58] led up to the situation. We want to lift
[21:01] up his family and pray for everyone
[21:03] involved.
[21:05] [Music]
[21:06] We live in peerless times. Brothers,
[21:09] sisters, do you have a request that
[21:11] you'd like to make known to the Lord
[21:13] with an uplifted hand? I know we're all
[21:17] needing in one way or another. Let's
[21:20] approach him.
[21:23] Precious heavenly father, first of all,
[21:25] Lord, we
[21:27] thank you. We thank you for the the
[21:30] praise
[21:32] of
[21:34] that was written out from brother
[21:35] Lionel, Sister Lonnie, the work that
[21:37] they were able to to do up there with
[21:41] these firefighters, the testimony that
[21:43] they were. We want to thank you, Lord,
[21:46] for bringing them back into our midst.
[21:48] Thank you, Lord, for bringing brother
[21:50] Jordan, sister Martha, and the family
[21:52] back, granting them safe
[21:55] journeys, Lord. And
[21:57] Lord, it's always good to have our
[21:58] brothers and sisters back.
[22:01] Now, Father, there are many that are
[22:03] probably not with us this morning.
[22:07] They're traveling or or whatever. We'd
[22:10] ask that you'd be with them. the hands
[22:12] that were raised. We want to ask that
[22:15] you'd minister unto each need.
[22:19] Even though it was unspoken, Lord, we
[22:21] knew we know that.
[22:24] You knew about this before the
[22:27] foundations of of the earth. So Lord,
[22:32] minister to the needs of your people,
[22:34] your children. Nothing's too great for
[22:37] you, Lord. And these requests that were
[22:39] written out, we commit them
[22:42] to you and lay them at your feet,
[22:45] knowing Lord
[22:47] the needs of each of your these
[22:50] requests. Be with us, Lord, in the
[22:52] remainder of the service. Come move
[22:55] among the aisles and bless us with your
[22:57] presence. We invite you, Lord.
[23:01] And Lord, I just want to say thank you,
[23:04] Lord. I love you and I know that each of
[23:06] my brothers and sisters love you dearly.
[23:10] Come be glorified this morning. Lord,
[23:14] bless our pastor as he would minister
[23:16] the word. Bless the remainder of the
[23:19] songs and Lord, as the offering is taken
[23:22] up,
[23:24] would you bless the offering, Lord,
[23:26] bless the giver and use it for your
[23:28] honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name.
[23:30] Amen.
[23:34] Thank you, brother.
[23:37] You can all have your seats.
[23:42] Lord, I lift your name.
[23:45] I said earlier about the one song that'd
[23:48] be dedicated to the Lord, but really all
[23:49] these songs are dedicated to the Lord.
[23:52] [Music]
[23:54] Lord, I lift your name.
[24:02] Oh Lord, my heart can grow
[24:07] so far away and cold.
[24:13] And yet for me your love is still the
[24:18] same.
[24:20] [Music]
[24:23] Lord, I bend my knee
[24:28] in awe and fear of thee.
[24:33] My head bowed down in reence to your
[24:38] name. Let's sing that verse again. Lord,
[24:40] my heart can grow.
[24:43] Lord, my heart can grow
[24:48] so far away and cold.
[24:51] [Music]
[24:53] And yet for me, your love is still the
[24:58] same.
[25:03] Lord, I bend my knee
[25:08] in awe and fear of thee.
[25:13] My head bowed down in reverence to your
[25:18] throne.
[25:22] Lord, I lift your name.
[25:28] Your holy
[25:30] name.
[25:33] Jehovah
[25:35] God.
[25:37] Elohim.
[25:42] You're the great
[25:45] I am
[25:48] the risen
[25:51] lamb,
[25:53] my comforter
[25:57] and king. Lord, my heart's desire.
[26:03] Oh Lord, my heart's desire
[26:07] is to be filled with the spirit's fire.
[26:13] My purpose is to worship you alone.
[26:23] Open up my soul. Yes, Lord. To worship
[26:29] and adore.
[26:32] to be a fragrance offered
[26:36] to your throne.
[26:41] Lord, I lift your name,
[26:47] your holy
[26:49] name.
[26:52] Jehovah
[26:54] God.
[26:56] Elohim,
[26:58] [Music]
[27:00] you're the great. I am
[27:06] the risen
[27:09] lamb,
[27:11] my comforter
[27:13] [Music]
[27:15] and king. Let's sing that second verse
[27:18] again. My heart's desire,
[27:21] oh Lord, my heart's desire
[27:25] is to be filled with the spirit. How
[27:28] many want that? Oh, my purpose is to
[27:33] worship you alone.
[27:38] Open up my soul. Open up my soul
[27:45] to worship and adore
[27:50] to be a fragrance offered to your
[27:54] throne.
[27:58] Oh Lord, I lift your name,
[28:04] your holy
[28:06] name.
[28:09] Jehovah
[28:11] God. Elohim,
[28:17] you're the great I am.
[28:23] The risen
[28:26] lamb,
[28:28] my comforter
[28:32] and king. The great I am.
[28:36] Oh, you're the great I am
[28:42] the risen
[28:45] lamb,
[28:47] my comforter
[28:49] [Music]
[28:52] and king.
[28:56] Amen. Would you stand with me as brother
[28:58] Daniel comes?
[29:01] We're going to sing I feel the pole
[29:04] key of E flat. will start.
[29:07] Um, we were out of town last week and we
[29:10] got to hear the man who wrote this song
[29:11] tell the story. He's a pastor and has a
[29:15] real heart for the for the lost, a real
[29:18] heart for God's people. And when he was
[29:21] uh young and had just freshly started
[29:24] his church, he wrote this song about
[29:28] feeling the pull of God
[29:31] every day in his life. and he didn't
[29:33] quite know why or what the reason was.
[29:35] And if you can put the first verse up
[29:37] there and I just thought about our
[29:40] pastor, Brother Daniel, when I heard
[29:41] this, I know he's got such a burden for
[29:44] the lost here in Tucson. And I thought
[29:47] about uh how he how he wants to see a
[29:51] group of people that really know the
[29:52] Lord and to feel that pull just to be
[29:56] closer to him.
[29:58] Let's sing this and let's worship the
[30:01] Lord. Let's create an atmosphere that
[30:03] the Lord can be pleased to dwell in as
[30:05] the word comes this morning so that we
[30:08] could all leave better Christians than
[30:10] when we came in. Do we want that? Amen.
[30:16] At night, I lay in bed and I begin to
[30:24] cry.
[30:29] And my mind just fails to know
[30:34] exactly
[30:36] why.
[30:40] I can't explain
[30:43] with tongue or pen.
[30:47] The spirit's groanings
[30:50] deep within.
[30:53] But it must be God
[30:56] here in my soul.
[30:59] For I feel the pull.
[31:06] I feel the pull.
[31:09] [Music]
[31:12] I hear the call.
[31:16] [Music]
[31:18] And I know the spirit's
[31:22] moving
[31:23] me to give my all.
[31:29] [Music]
[31:31] He speaks to me
[31:36] [Music]
[31:38] and I agree.
[31:42] Make this your prayer right now. Oh
[31:44] Lord, please come and take control cuz I
[31:51] feel the pull.
[31:56] [Music]
[31:58] And I went to hear the word. That's why
[32:00] we're here this morning.
[32:03] And I went to hear the word. And with
[32:09] each line and phrase,
[32:13] [Music]
[32:17] he was drawing
[32:19] me to give a higher
[32:24] praise.
[32:28] For there's a deep
[32:32] call to the deep
[32:35] like a great magnet pulling
[32:39] me. Oh, I know for sure
[32:44] I'll reach the goal for I feel the pull.
[32:53] I feel the pull.
[32:59] And I hear the call.
[33:04] [Music]
[33:06] And his spirit's
[33:09] moving
[33:10] me to give my all.
[33:18] He speaks to me
[33:24] and I agree.
[33:30] Oh Lord, please come and take control.
[33:37] I feel the pull. Oh, just draw close to
[33:41] him this morning. Oh, I feel the pull.
[33:46] Oh,
[33:49] I hear the call
[33:55] and I know the spirit's
[33:59] moving
[34:00] me to give my all.
[34:08] He speaks to me
[34:14] and I
[34:15] [Music]
[34:20] Lord, please come and take control.
[34:26] I feel the poor.
[34:32] Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[34:37] Almighty God,
[34:40] Lord, it feels so good when we feel that
[34:43] pull. Just Lord, it we can't explain it,
[34:48] Lord. We almost It's like the wind. We
[34:51] don't know where it comes from and we
[34:54] don't know where it's going, but Lord,
[34:55] we know it's there.
[34:58] Father, when when we feel that pull,
[35:01] Lord, as David wrote in the psalm, when
[35:04] the deep as the deep calls to the deep,
[35:08] Father,
[35:10] may the deep respond to the pole.
[35:14] Lord, if there would be one or more here
[35:17] today that is feeling your call, Lord,
[35:22] we pray that they'd be recognized and
[35:26] answered.
[35:28] We love you and we thank you.
[35:31] Father, we just now humbly invite your
[35:33] presence that you would be here with us.
[35:36] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[35:40] If you continue to play, Sister Katie,
[35:43] let's
[35:45] remain standing and let's turn to the
[35:47] book of Micah,
[35:49] chapter 6.
[35:53] We'll start with verse six.
[36:04] It reads like this.
[36:10] With what shall I come before the Lord
[36:15] and bestow myself
[36:18] before the high God?
[36:27] Let me read it again. Wherewith shall I
[36:29] come before the Lord and bow myself
[36:31] before the high God? Shall I come before
[36:34] him with burnt offerings, with a calf of
[36:38] a year old?
[36:41] [Music]
[36:43] Verse number seven says, "Will the Lord
[36:46] be pleased with a thousand rams or with
[36:49] 10,000 of rivers of oil? Shall I give my
[36:52] firstborn for a transgression, the fruit
[36:54] of my body, for the sin of my soul?
[37:00] He has
[37:02] shown thee, oh man, what is good, and
[37:06] what do the Lord require of thee, but to
[37:09] do justly, and to love mercy, and to
[37:13] walk humbly with thy God. Amen. What
[37:17] words from the prophet Micah? You can be
[37:19] seated here. Um,
[37:23] something
[37:25] is in my trash can in my office
[37:29] that you usually don't see.
[37:33] And Heath, I just want to I want to tell
[37:35] the congregation just because I love
[37:38] you. Brother Heath walked in to my
[37:42] office this morning. Brother Aaron Gara
[37:44] and I were there and he walked in
[37:48] and he said, "I'm done." And he takes a
[37:52] pack of cigarettes,
[37:54] he throws them in my garbage, my my
[37:57] garbage can.
[38:05] And I said, "Bro, is it okay if I tell
[38:06] the church?" He goes, "Oh, yeah." He
[38:08] says, "I'm done."
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; He He said um he said this is it and I
[38:16] believe him or I wouldn't say it in
[38:18] front of all of us. Very proud very
[38:20] proud of my friend Heath. We've been
[38:22] friend for a long friends for a long
[38:23] time and he's been struggling with
[38:25] cigarettes and this is the end. Man,
[38:27] praise God.
[38:30] I I was gone this past week. I was in
[38:33] Washington DC. I was at a leadership
[38:35] conference and the whole week was
[38:38] dedicated. They they had a group of
[38:40] people that they that they put together
[38:42] and and they had certain people with
[38:45] this strength and others with that
[38:47] strength and they they put us together
[38:49] in a few different groups, four
[38:51] different groups and we were to solve a
[38:53] problem. So all week we were working on
[38:57] this one problem and really worked hard
[39:00] on it. And the the last day I was the
[39:03] main presenter to the um to this
[39:07] executive team
[39:09] and I was all excited about getting up
[39:12] there and and giving the presentation
[39:15] and representing our team and they they
[39:18] had their part in the presentation also.
[39:21] But when I when I finished, I just I
[39:25] felt like, boy, I really failed. I felt
[39:29] like I didn't do a good job. And was
[39:32] going home and I got to the airport and
[39:36] man, I was just pondering on this like
[39:38] like Lord, I I really I didn't do a good
[39:42] job. It wasn't received like I thought
[39:44] it was going to be received. It wasn't
[39:47] successful like I thought it was going
[39:48] to be successful.
[39:51] And I'm really down in the airport and
[39:57] I was, you know, trying to get my mind
[39:59] off of it, scrolling, and I I read a
[40:01] story that I'm going to talk about here
[40:02] in a minute. And I got on the airplane
[40:05] and and I just started to pray saying,
[40:08] "Lord, what did I do wrong?
[40:12] What why did I fail?"
[40:15] And
[40:18] something said, I don't I believe it was
[40:21] the Lord that
[40:24] told me, "Were you humble
[40:27] when you presented it? Were you humble
[40:30] during this whole time?"
[40:33] Look at your motives and what you wanted
[40:35] to do. And as I was on the airplane and
[40:38] I was praying and I and you know when we
[40:41] get a correction sometimes
[40:45] it's it's like a a baby
[40:48] or a kid that gets a spank and the first
[40:50] thing they they want to do is they want
[40:52] to love on you. You don't want to spank
[40:54] them but but sometimes you have to and
[40:56] then there's this love and and as I was
[41:00] flying I was like Lord I love you so
[41:02] much. You're right. It was when when I
[41:06] was given this presentation, when I was
[41:07] working all week and the night before I
[41:09] stayed up really late and putting the
[41:11] presentation together, I thought this is
[41:12] going to go really good. They're going
[41:14] to really like this answer. And then the
[41:16] next morning I woke up early and the
[41:18] same thing and and the whole thing was
[41:19] like this is going to be really really a
[41:22] good presentation. All is going to work
[41:25] well. And then it really fell kind of
[41:27] flat. And I I look back after I really
[41:31] believe I received my correction from
[41:32] the Lord and really it was just all
[41:35] about me.
[41:38] I wanted to do a good job.
[41:41] Was it really the subject that I was
[41:44] that we were trying to solve but has a
[41:47] potential of affecting over 100,000
[41:49] people
[41:51] or was it just me? I wanted I wanted to
[41:53] perform well. I wanted to do a good job.
[41:58] And I saw that with my failures it was I
[42:02] just it was about me.
[42:05] And that's how we fail friends so much
[42:08] is that we want to present something or
[42:11] we'll have a conversation with someone
[42:13] and we'll we'll answer in a certain way
[42:16] or present ourselves in a certain way
[42:19] that really you're just trying to
[42:22] impress whoever you're talking to or
[42:24] you're trying to take a certain side and
[42:26] you're not really searching out for what
[42:29] is the truth, what is the right thing.
[42:34] There was so I said I was kind of get my
[42:37] mind off and I was reading the news
[42:40] and there was a uh there was a woman
[42:44] that got arrested in Connecticut. I
[42:46] don't know if you all saw it. She was a
[42:49] a lawyer and they were coming out of uh
[42:52] I believe it was a restaurant
[42:55] and the restaurant called the cops. They
[42:57] were causing some sort of her, it was
[42:59] her, her friend and a man and they were
[43:03] causing some sort of a disturbance
[43:05] inside the establishment
[43:08] and they called the cops and it was just
[43:12] it was just these women getting loud and
[43:14] they were like just we just want these
[43:15] people out of here and and the and the
[43:19] cop is like well are they trespassing?
[43:21] They said yes we just want them out. So
[43:23] the cop goes over to the two women and
[43:27] he says, "Listen." He says, "You just
[43:29] got to leave." And the woman was like,
[43:31] "You you can't tell me what to do." And
[43:33] she says, "Listen." And she starts
[43:34] telling the cop how to do his job. She
[43:36] says, "If the if I request it, you have
[43:38] to turn off your your body camera." And
[43:41] he's like, "No." He's like, "Listen, can
[43:43] you just leave?" And she's like, "No,
[43:44] you have to turn off your body camera."
[43:46] Starts fighting back and forth. And the
[43:48] cop the cop is like, "Listen, can you
[43:50] just leave?
[43:53] And she had a point to prove.
[43:56] She was being arrogant.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; So she, the cop, finally says, "Listen,
[44:04] I'm going to put you in handcuffs." He
[44:06] puts her in handcuffs. She starts
[44:07] freaking out. She says, "I'm a DA. I'm a
[44:09] district attorney." And she kept yelling
[44:12] this. And the cop, to his credit, he
[44:14] said, "Good for you." He says, "I don't
[44:16] care." He didn't say it in those words,
[44:19] but it was kind of like that.
[44:22] He says, "I don't care."
[44:24] And she's yelling and her friend, they
[44:27] they go over to get her friend and they
[44:29] put her in handcuffs and these two women
[44:31] are yelling and they put the woman the
[44:34] the lawyer in the car. The other woman
[44:36] is like, "You should listen to her.
[44:38] She's a lawyer." And the cops are like,
[44:39] "Listen, just you guys just leave." So
[44:41] once they even get them in handcuffs, he
[44:44] the cop is trying to calm them down and
[44:45] saying, "Listen, you're not under
[44:46] arrest. Can you just leave?"
[44:49] But the arrogance in her if she would
[44:51] have just been a little humble,
[44:53] she could have just left.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; But she was not going to give it up. She
[44:59] gets put in handcuffs and they stuff her
[45:01] in the car and she makes this statement.
[45:05] She says, "You're going to regret this."
[45:08] Get her in the car and she's arrested
[45:12] for disorderly conduct and trespassing
[45:14] or whatever it might be.
[45:17] And If the woman
[45:20] would have just humbled down
[45:24] and just accepted the fact even if she
[45:27] didn't think he's wrong, just she was
[45:28] wrong, just be humble. Jesus said, he
[45:31] says, listen to this. He Jesus says, he
[45:33] says, don't judge others
[45:37] and you won't be judged
[45:39] for you will be treated as you treat
[45:42] others.
[45:44] the standard you use in judging is the
[45:47] standard by which you will be judged.
[45:50] So, she's telling the cops how to do
[45:52] their job. And then right at the end,
[45:55] she says, "You're going to regret this."
[45:57] And all of a sudden, we see now this
[45:59] lady's not going to work tomorrow
[46:03] because the standard that she was
[46:04] setting for these cops now came down on
[46:07] her and she's famous now. The video went
[46:11] viral and she's embarrassed. This
[46:15] district attorney, she's suspended
[46:18] without pay. She's not going to work
[46:20] tomorrow. And it all comes down to she
[46:23] tells the cops, "You're going to regret
[46:24] this." Now, who is regretting it? And
[46:26] the poor girl, I feel bad for her
[46:28] because she made a fool of herself. But
[46:30] if she would have just humbled, the Lord
[46:33] gave her, the cop gave her chance after
[46:37] chance after chance, just leave. but she
[46:40] wouldn't give it up. If she would have
[46:43] just had a little bit of humility,
[46:46] then she'd be going to work tomorrow.
[46:49] But she didn't.
[46:51] And that's how it is with so many of us,
[46:54] friends.
[46:56] A lot of times, if we would just humble
[46:57] ourselves,
[46:59] &gt;&gt; and we would just stand back
[47:03] and and say, you know what, it's not
[47:05] worth it. It's not worth a fight. or
[47:08] heaven forbid you say, "You know what? I
[47:10] was wrong.
[47:12] I was deceived. I made a mistake. I I
[47:16] just I shouldn't have done it." And then
[47:18] you'll see that the Lord is so often is
[47:22] just like that cop. The Lord's like,
[47:24] "It's okay. Come back."
[47:26] &gt;&gt; And then he takes care of everything.
[47:28] Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; But if we if we get this arrogance to us
[47:31] and we get this strong will that no I'm
[47:35] I'm right in this or you're the way that
[47:38] this direction is going or whatever it
[47:40] might be that no I want my way and then
[47:44] God will take the the judgment that we
[47:47] have put on someone else
[47:49] &gt;&gt; and then bring it right back on us like
[47:52] he did that lady
[47:54] &gt;&gt; where it's like
[47:58] You said you're going to regret this.
[47:59] Now she's regretting it. And I do. I
[48:01] feel bad for the the lady. But she
[48:04] brought it on herself. And that's how we
[48:07] are. We need to be very very careful in
[48:11] how we do things and why we are doing
[48:13] things. I look at our our worship team
[48:16] with with brother Josiah and and Daniel
[48:20] and and the girls
[48:24] and and brother Michael and the
[48:26] different ones and
[48:28] When we are leading worship,
[48:31] we need to make sure that we're not
[48:34] leading worship because it's like the
[48:37] audience will like that. The audience
[48:39] will appreciate that because it'll be
[48:41] like me. This is what I thought that the
[48:44] audience wanted to hear and I failed
[48:47] because I was doing it for the audience
[48:50] instead of doing it for the main issue.
[48:52] and with us whether I'm ministering my
[48:55] my biggest failures even as a minister
[48:59] have been because this sounds good
[49:03] this will help this the congregation
[49:05] will like this
[49:07] and it doesn't work out because I'm not
[49:11] humbling myself
[49:13] and seeking the Lord on this and
[49:17] humility
[49:18] friends it is one of the most important
[49:21] lessons that we can live that we can
[49:23] learn in life whether it be work,
[49:26] &gt;&gt; church, whether it be a husband and a
[49:28] wife.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Is it really worth the fight? It's not.
[49:34] It almost never is. But because one or
[49:38] both won't humble themselves, usually
[49:40] it's if if one humbles themselves
[49:43] themselves, then the other one will fall
[49:45] right in. And I use driving as a
[49:47] scenario a lot. I talk about traffic
[49:50] because we're all in traffic. We all
[49:52] drive and we all sin in traffic. You are
[49:58] not a Christian
[50:00] outside of your car, but you're okay.
[50:03] You're exempt inside.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; You're a Christian inside of your car
[50:07] just as you are outside. And do you
[50:09] think that the way you drive
[50:12] that that doesn't count? It does count.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; In all seriousness, it does matter.
[50:19] So when you're driving along and
[50:21] somebody wants to cut in front of you,
[50:23] let them have it.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Be a Christian in your car, be a
[50:27] Christian everywhere you are. And humble
[50:30] yourself.
[50:32] This humility that I'm talking about,
[50:34] this goes on in heaven. It's not just
[50:36] here. There is an absolutely tremendous
[50:41] scripture that I want to talk about
[50:42] that's about humility here in a moment.
[50:48] and my failures. And I'm sure many of
[50:51] you can say the same thing. It's because
[50:54] that I wouldn't just humble myself.
[50:57] Proverbs 18:12 says this.
[51:00] Before destruction,
[51:02] the heart of a man is is hotty and
[51:06] before honor is humility.
[51:10] So notice it says before
[51:13] honor is humility. So to get to the
[51:17] honor part, you have to go through
[51:20] humility.
[51:22] And to get to destruction, friends,
[51:27] you have to go through pride.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; You have to go through a hotty way. You
[51:33] have to go through a highway. So you see
[51:36] the destination here. And if you want to
[51:39] be honored before the Lord, you've got
[51:41] to go through the humility part. It says
[51:44] before honor, before
[51:48] comes humility. My failure when I was in
[51:51] DC,
[51:53] before I could have got what I wanted to
[51:55] get, I had to go through the humility
[51:58] part. And that's the part I skipped and
[52:00] I failed.
[52:02] That lady, if she would have just gone
[52:05] through the humility part, she'd still
[52:07] have her job today and still be doing
[52:09] well.
[52:12] So in this, let me read it again. Before
[52:14] destruction, the heart of a man is hotty
[52:16] and before honor is humility. And one of
[52:19] the reasons, and and I'll say this as I
[52:21] was praying about this yesterday,
[52:24] one of the reasons that I really do have
[52:28] such admiration
[52:30] for so many people in this church
[52:34] is because I see a humility in our
[52:38] people. And I I greatly admire it. I
[52:42] greatly love it. I see how that there
[52:46] really isn't a self in many people. And
[52:49] and you see, you wonder why miracles
[52:54] follow
[52:55] new converts?
[52:58] Why do miracles follow those that were
[53:03] sinners not too long ago? Why do they
[53:05] have all the miracles? And it seems like
[53:06] they do. It's because they're humble
[53:09] before the Lord. They've been humbled.
[53:13] And then why doesn't it follow all of
[53:16] the heady, high-minded um religious
[53:19] people? Why isn't it there? It's because
[53:23] they are not they don't have that
[53:25] humility that so many others have.
[53:29] It's just to me it's just it's this
[53:32] humility is such a great thing.
[53:36] It's in heaven. Listen
[53:38] to this.
[53:42] Isaiah chapter 6.
[53:46] And I really believe that our failures
[53:50] in this church
[53:53] both in the past and in the future
[53:57] will be because we want a certain thing.
[54:00] We want a certain style because it is
[54:02] acceptable in our circle of friends or
[54:04] in our communities.
[54:06] And that's where we will fail
[54:09] &gt;&gt; and not be humble before the Lord and
[54:10] not not be ready to move as he wants to
[54:13] move. And our successes will because
[54:16] will be because that we can humble
[54:17] ourselves before the Lord and let him
[54:22] use us. As I said, our our our worship
[54:24] team, Josiah, you are not
[54:28] singing. You are not leading for the
[54:32] congregation.
[54:34] You are leading as the Lord leads to
[54:38] please him
[54:40] &gt;&gt; and then we all will benefit.
[54:43] But if if and same thing with me and
[54:45] ministering, I am not ministering to
[54:48] please you. The Bible forbids that. It
[54:52] says in in um Paul writing to Timothy,
[54:55] he said, "For in the end times,
[54:58] for the time will come when they will
[55:00] not endure sound doctrine, but they
[55:02] shall heap for themselves teachers
[55:05] having itching ears." These teachers
[55:07] will be there to please the audience,
[55:11] to please the system, to please the
[55:14] world,
[55:16] and not to please God. Isaiah chapter 6,
[55:21] listen to the angels and listen to their
[55:23] humility.
[55:25] Says this, "In the year that King Uzziah
[55:29] died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[55:34] throne high and lifted up, and his train
[55:39] filled the temple." This is the prophet
[55:40] Isaiah speaking of a vision.
[55:44] Above it
[55:46] stood the seraraphims.
[55:49] Each one had six wings.
[55:52] With twain he covered his face. With two
[55:54] he covered his face. And with two he
[55:57] covered his feet. And with two he did
[55:59] fly.
[56:01] So these angels have six wings. One set
[56:04] of wings is to fly. But what are these
[56:07] other two set of wings for?
[56:10] They cover his feet and they cover his
[56:13] face.
[56:15] Their humility
[56:17] before the Lord. And here they are and
[56:20] they're flying around here with these
[56:23] wings covering themselves in humility
[56:27] before God. And we we always talk about
[56:30] winning a soul to Christ. We always talk
[56:32] about talk about doing miracles and all
[56:35] that. And now we have we we have all of
[56:38] these internet
[56:40] miracle workers going out there and what
[56:43] are they all doing? It's 100% because of
[56:45] where it's at. All of them are videoing
[56:48] themselves.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; And here they are. That's why so many of
[56:53] them are false. Jesus said in the last
[56:55] days false prophets would arise and and
[56:57] deceive many. So we have doesn't mean
[57:00] that they won't. They are. They're
[57:01] everywhere. And how can they deceive
[57:03] many? They can deceive many on social
[57:04] media. And here their biggest thing is
[57:07] not that they care maybe about the
[57:09] person, but they care about the video
[57:11] that's videoing them.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; And look at the difference with these
[57:15] angels. They're covering their face.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; If you really want to win a soul to
[57:21] Christ, get in your closet
[57:24] &gt;&gt; and quiet.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Get on your knees
[57:28] &gt;&gt; and you pray for that person. Then
[57:32] you can pray. And then there's works
[57:33] associated. Then you reach out to that
[57:36] person. You love that person. You're
[57:39] willing to help that person. That's what
[57:41] wins a soul. And it's not
[57:45] Facebook or Instagram or whatever. Here
[57:48] I am this morning having my coffee,
[57:50] reading my Bible. Little picture,
[57:53] you know. Here I am out feeding the
[57:54] poor. Little picture.
[57:57] These angels had their faces covered.
[57:59] And we want our faces out everywhere
[58:00] today. Wow.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; If you really if you want to win a soul,
[58:07] if you really want miracles, if you want
[58:09] these things to happen, then
[58:11] think about the person that needs them.
[58:14] Think about God
[58:16] &gt;&gt; and take yourself out of it. If you can
[58:19] just be that one that's in the closet
[58:23] praying. Jesus said that the the
[58:25] Pharisees, they have their reward
[58:27] because they're standing out in the
[58:28] street quarters and they're making these
[58:29] big long prayers and they they're
[58:30] they're out on YouTube and they're doing
[58:32] all their thing. And then this other
[58:35] one,
[58:36] Jesus said, "No." He says, "They have
[58:38] their reward. You go into your closet."
[58:42] And he said, "You go before the Lord
[58:45] secretly,
[58:47] and then he will reward you openly, not
[58:51] you, but the Lord will reward your
[58:55] prayers because you did it in humility."
[58:58] And he would heal that person. He would
[59:00] deliver that person. That's a true
[59:02] prayer. That is true humility. It's not
[59:05] that you can get the credit for it.
[59:08] And these angels here they are. I mean,
[59:10] these are great angels,
[59:14] and they're in the presence of God, and
[59:15] they have their faces covered and their
[59:18] feet covered in reverence, in humility
[59:21] before the Lord.
[59:23] Verse number two,
[59:26] again, above it stood the saraphim. Each
[59:30] one had six wings. With twain he covered
[59:33] his face, and with twain he covered his
[59:35] feet, and with twain he did fly. And one
[59:37] cried unto the other and said, "Holy,
[59:39] holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The
[59:42] whole earth is filled with is full of
[59:44] his glory." So they were, you notice
[59:48] they're not looking up at God. They're
[59:50] looking at each other.
[59:53] Says very plainly, "And one cried to the
[59:56] other one."
[59:58] And they were saying, "Holy, holy,
[1:00:00] holy." They were saying, "Can you
[1:00:01] believe how great God is? Can you
[1:00:03] believe how holy is he? Can you believe
[1:00:06] how wonderful he is? And they're looking
[1:00:09] at each other and they're saying these
[1:00:11] things and they have their face covered
[1:00:13] before the Lord. It's not about the
[1:00:15] seraraphim. It was about God. And they
[1:00:17] were rejoicing with each other about how
[1:00:19] great God is.
[1:00:22] And that's our example
[1:00:25] here. And it's they aren't
[1:00:28] there's a there's a lot of times that we
[1:00:30] get worked up
[1:00:33] and we get an emotional response.
[1:00:37] I saw a lady who was dying of cancer.
[1:00:42] And
[1:00:44] here are these seraraphims and they're
[1:00:46] they're they're worshiping God and
[1:00:48] they're talking to each other how great
[1:00:49] God is. And I saw this video of this
[1:00:51] this woman who was dying of cancer and
[1:00:53] she goes to a Taylor Swift concert
[1:00:55] and she was had her hands up and
[1:00:58] shouting and crying.
[1:01:01] That's not real. That's just emotion.
[1:01:05] But when we can look at each other and
[1:01:07] say, "Can you believe how great God is?
[1:01:09] Can you believe how wonderful he is?
[1:01:11] Man, he did this for me. He can do it
[1:01:14] for you." And you're out there and
[1:01:15] you're witnessing and you say, "God is
[1:01:17] great. He's wonderful." Let me tell you
[1:01:19] what he did for me. And and you're holy,
[1:01:21] holy, holy. It's not about me. My face
[1:01:24] is covered, but God is wonderful. Look
[1:01:26] to him. That's when you get results.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; And here's these saraphims.
[1:01:32] And it was such a powerful thing. And
[1:01:35] they're looking at each other and
[1:01:36] they're like, "Can you believe it?
[1:01:39] Can you believe that God would call me
[1:01:41] out?"
[1:01:42] We can say today,
[1:01:44] can you believe that God would choose me
[1:01:48] to believe him? To believe his word to
[1:01:52] believe on Jesus Christ? Can you believe
[1:01:54] that God would choose me that that the
[1:01:56] blood of Christ would cover me? Can you
[1:01:59] believe that he's he is he's awesome. He
[1:02:03] is great. He did this in my life. Now he
[1:02:05] can do it in your life.
[1:02:08] And its power is associated with that.
[1:02:12] And watch the power of God manifest
[1:02:14] itself when he is worshiped in humility.
[1:02:19] And the posts of the door moved at the
[1:02:23] voice of him that cried and the house
[1:02:26] was filled with smoke. So the very posts
[1:02:30] maybe of the church were shaking because
[1:02:32] they were worshiping God. It wasn't
[1:02:34] about them. It was about him. And they
[1:02:37] were looking at each other and they were
[1:02:38] saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord."
[1:02:40] And they were all excited and they were
[1:02:42] just rejoicing. And the walls, it was so
[1:02:44] great that the walls were shaking
[1:02:47] because there was power there.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; It was humility in these angels. How
[1:02:53] great are these angels? And yet they
[1:02:56] were humble.
[1:02:58] Now watch what happens when Isaiah sees
[1:03:00] the power.
[1:03:03] And humility
[1:03:05] will point
[1:03:08] not as the angels,
[1:03:10] it won't point to the angels, but it'll
[1:03:12] point to God.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; And and they're looking at each other
[1:03:17] and they're amazed by the greatness of
[1:03:19] God. And Isaiah sees them and what they
[1:03:22] are doing. And now Isaiah's eyes,
[1:03:27] the humility that he's seeing in these
[1:03:29] angels when they're covering their
[1:03:31] faces. Now Isaiah is seeing wow. He's
[1:03:34] saying he he sees their humility and now
[1:03:36] he's looking at God and Isaiah says woe
[1:03:39] is me
[1:03:42] for I am undone
[1:03:45] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[1:03:47] dwell in the midst of people of unclean
[1:03:49] lips for mine eyes have seen the king
[1:03:51] the Lord of hosts. These angels are so
[1:03:54] have such a great representation
[1:03:57] of how a w how to witness to others.
[1:04:02] It's a great witness and how we should
[1:04:04] pray for others. It's a great witness of
[1:04:07] how we should minister,
[1:04:09] how we should lead worship. We look at
[1:04:11] him. He's awesome. And as we're singing,
[1:04:14] it's like he is great. He is wonderful.
[1:04:17] Keep your eyes on him. And as humans, we
[1:04:21] can say, "Here's what he did for me."
[1:04:25] Can you believe how great he is? And
[1:04:27] here the walls of the place were shaken
[1:04:31] because of the humility of the angels
[1:04:36] and their love and their admiration of
[1:04:38] God.
[1:04:40] Now, there's a have time to to tell it.
[1:04:43] There's a testimony of a
[1:04:46] of a man in the Bible. I think he may be
[1:04:50] the only Gentile to have anything
[1:04:53] written in the Bible. He was pretty much
[1:04:58] the greatest gentile king that had ever
[1:05:01] lived. It's not Donald Trump.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; This man named Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar was a rough guy as you
[1:05:11] know. He's the one that invaded
[1:05:13] um Jerusalem and he took all the people
[1:05:17] captive. He took Daniel the prophet
[1:05:18] captive, put him in exile there. The
[1:05:23] Hebrews were there for 70 years. And
[1:05:25] here is this Nebuchadnezzar, probably
[1:05:27] the most powerful man on earth. And he
[1:05:30] writes his own testimony in Daniel
[1:05:31] chapter 4.
[1:05:34] And Daniel includes it in his book.
[1:05:38] Let's go to Daniel chapter 4 28.
[1:05:43] And this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:05:46] I'll read the New King James version.
[1:05:47] It's a little easier to understand. And
[1:05:49] and all this came upon King
[1:05:51] Nebuchadnezzar at the end of the 12
[1:05:53] months he was walking about the royal
[1:05:56] palace of Babylon. The king spoke
[1:05:59] saying, "Is not this great Babylon that
[1:06:03] I have built for a royal dwelling by my
[1:06:07] mighty power and for the honor of my
[1:06:09] majesty?" So look at the pride in
[1:06:12] Nebuchadnezzar. Look at the lack of
[1:06:14] humility.
[1:06:16] This is not the way to approach God.
[1:06:19] This is not the way to approach anything
[1:06:21] in our lives. Look at the DA and the
[1:06:23] trouble that she got into. She was like,
[1:06:25] "Look at how great I am. I'm a DA. I am
[1:06:28] I am a lawyer. I I know your job better
[1:06:30] than you and it didn't work out well for
[1:06:32] her and it's not going to work out well
[1:06:34] for this man Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:06:37] Before we get too far into
[1:06:39] Nebuchadnezzar, we got to see what is is
[1:06:43] inspiring
[1:06:44] this kind of spirit where we look at
[1:06:47] ourselves and we want to please
[1:06:48] ourselves rather than looking at God.
[1:06:50] Ezekiel 28 says this verse number 11. It
[1:06:54] says, ' Moreover, the word of the Lord
[1:06:55] came to me, saying,
[1:06:58] Son of man, take up a lamentation
[1:06:59] against upon the king of Tyrus, and say
[1:07:02] unto him, thus sayeth the Lord God, thou
[1:07:04] sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and
[1:07:06] perfect in beauty. Now watch the spirit
[1:07:10] of Satan that enters into those that are
[1:07:13] not humble.
[1:07:14] Thou hast been in Eden, in the garden of
[1:07:17] God.
[1:07:19] Every precious stone was thy covering.
[1:07:22] The sardis and topaz and diamond and
[1:07:23] barrel and onyx and jasper, the
[1:07:26] sapphire, the emerald, the carbuncle and
[1:07:28] the gold. The workmanship of thy tabets
[1:07:31] and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in
[1:07:35] the day that thou was created. Yet
[1:07:38] another scripture where Satan is in the
[1:07:39] Garden of Eden
[1:07:42] and he was in the most beautiful place
[1:07:44] and he was probably it looks like he was
[1:07:46] the most beautiful thing in that place.
[1:07:49] The pride welled up in this spirit.
[1:07:55] Thou art thou art the anointed cherub
[1:07:57] that coverereth
[1:07:59] and I have set thee so. Thou was upon
[1:08:02] the holy mountain of God. Thou hast
[1:08:04] walked up and down in the midst of the
[1:08:05] stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy
[1:08:08] ways from the day that thou was created
[1:08:10] till the till iniquity was found in
[1:08:12] thee.
[1:08:13] So what is this iniquity? What's this
[1:08:15] sin that was found in this this man?
[1:08:18] Amen. But the multitude of thy
[1:08:21] merchandise they filled the midst of
[1:08:24] thee with violence and thou hast sinned.
[1:08:27] Therefore I will cast thee as profane
[1:08:29] out of the mountain of God. And I will
[1:08:31] destroy thee, oh covering cherub, from
[1:08:33] the midst of the stones of fire. Thine
[1:08:36] heart was lifted up because of your
[1:08:39] beauty.
[1:08:42] Thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[1:08:44] of thy brightness. I will cast thee to
[1:08:46] the ground. I will lay thee before kings
[1:08:49] and that they may behold thee.
[1:08:54] Scripture in Proverbs before destruction
[1:08:57] the heart of man is hotty.
[1:09:00] Comes before
[1:09:02] and before honor is humility. So Satan,
[1:09:04] he's he's hotty and he's he's arrogant
[1:09:06] and he's self- worshiping and he's
[1:09:08] lifting himself up here.
[1:09:11] Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the
[1:09:13] multitudes of thine iniquities, by the
[1:09:15] iniquity of thy traffic. That's the
[1:09:17] modern translation that your trading
[1:09:19] your business. Therefore will I bring
[1:09:21] forth a fire from the midst of thee. It
[1:09:24] shall devour thee, and I will bring thee
[1:09:26] to ashes upon the earth in the sight of
[1:09:29] all them that behold thee. They that
[1:09:31] know thee among people shall be
[1:09:33] astonished at thee. Thou shalt be a
[1:09:35] terror
[1:09:38] means a horror and never shalt thou be
[1:09:40] anymore. Do you see the spirit of the
[1:09:42] enemy? Do you see the spirit of of I am
[1:09:46] I matter. I am special. I in my opinion
[1:09:49] is what's the most important?
[1:09:53] The enemy wants to the enemy is not our
[1:09:56] friend.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; He's no one's friend.
[1:10:00] He wants to see people fail
[1:10:04] and he will set us up, pump us up, and
[1:10:07] I've seen it happen many times. And so
[1:10:09] someone will be successful and then they
[1:10:12] will start getting this idea that
[1:10:14] they're important and that they mean
[1:10:16] more than someone else. And Satan will
[1:10:18] set them up and then they will fall and
[1:10:21] they will fail.
[1:10:23] He's not anyone's friend. He wants to
[1:10:26] see failure.
[1:10:28] And here he sets this king of Ty up
[1:10:32] and represents Satan and God's like, I'm
[1:10:34] going to bring you down.
[1:10:37] Isaiah also talks about this same guy,
[1:10:39] which is Satan. Isaiah 14:12.
[1:10:43] Isaiah prophesied just before Ezekiel.
[1:10:46] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[1:10:48] Lucifer,
[1:10:50] son of the morning?
[1:10:53] How art thou cut down to the ground
[1:10:54] which is weakest the nakans nations? For
[1:10:57] thou hast said in thy heart, I will
[1:11:00] ascend into heaven. I will exalt exalt
[1:11:03] my throne above the stars. I will sit
[1:11:06] upon the mount of the congregations in
[1:11:09] the sides of the north. I will ascend
[1:11:11] above the heights of the clouds. I will
[1:11:14] be like the most high. Yet thou shalt be
[1:11:17] brought down to hell to the sides of the
[1:11:20] pit.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I will cast out devils.
[1:11:25] I will preach the gospel. I will lead
[1:11:28] many to the Lord. I will do all this.
[1:11:31] And when it's all about I, we leave God
[1:11:34] out. Think of the chair. Think of the
[1:11:35] seraraphims in the in in heaven around
[1:11:38] the throne and their faces are covered.
[1:11:39] There is no I with them.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; It's all about him.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And it sets up for failure is what it
[1:11:47] does when it's all about me.
[1:11:51] Let's go back for time sake. Let's go
[1:11:54] back to Daniel
[1:11:57] um back to Daniel 4. Really pride
[1:12:02] and lack of humility. Satan uses it to
[1:12:05] destroy
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; because Satan himself knows
[1:12:10] that God's going to punish it.
[1:12:12] Remember the question about the evil
[1:12:14] spirit I answered the other day about
[1:12:16] the evil spirit coming from God that
[1:12:18] came upon King Saul. For those that are
[1:12:20] on our in our Wednesday Bible study,
[1:12:23] this is what happened. God can use
[1:12:26] Satan. Satan will come up before God and
[1:12:28] say, "I'll go down." God will say,
[1:12:29] "Okay, go ahead." It comes from the
[1:12:31] presence of God and it goes down and it
[1:12:33] deceives the people and makes them think
[1:12:35] that they are more special than they
[1:12:36] are. Makes them think that they are more
[1:12:38] powerful than they are. Tells them
[1:12:40] things like you can create worlds,
[1:12:43] you can cast out devils, you can do all
[1:12:45] of these things, and then nothing
[1:12:47] happens. And we're always looking for it
[1:12:49] to happen. We're looking for it to
[1:12:50] happen. It's because we have set our
[1:12:52] sights on ourselves and there's I there
[1:12:55] have forgotten about God and it's all
[1:12:58] about him and it's all about the person
[1:12:59] that's suffering. Instead, it's about
[1:13:01] us. That's why it doesn't happen.
[1:13:05] That's why it doesn't work.
[1:13:09] Verse number 28, we're back to
[1:13:11] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:13:12] and he's giving his testimony. He's
[1:13:14] standing before maybe like us standing
[1:13:16] before the congregation saying, "Hey, I
[1:13:18] messed up.
[1:13:20] I got prideful."
[1:13:22] All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:13:24] at the end of the 12 months. He was
[1:13:27] walking about the royal palace of
[1:13:28] Babylon. The king spoke saying, "Is not
[1:13:31] this great Babylon that I have built for
[1:13:34] a royal dwelling by my power and for the
[1:13:36] honor of my majesty?"
[1:13:39] While the word was still in the king's
[1:13:42] mouth, a voice fell from heaven, saying,
[1:13:45] "King Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:13:48] to you it is spoken, the kingdom has
[1:13:51] departed from you, and they shall drive
[1:13:53] you from men, and your dwelling shall be
[1:13:56] as the beasts of the field. They shall
[1:13:58] make you eat grass like oxen and seven
[1:14:01] times that means seven years shall pass
[1:14:04] over you until you know that the most
[1:14:06] high rules in the kingdom of men and
[1:14:09] gives it to whoever whoever he chooses.
[1:14:12] I don't care how powerful you are
[1:14:14] president. I don't care how powerful you
[1:14:16] are king. I don't care how powerful you
[1:14:18] are priest or pope or whatever. God is
[1:14:21] God.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; He is sovereign. If any of us have
[1:14:25] anything, it's because he gave it. And
[1:14:28] if we don't give him the glory for what
[1:14:30] we have, then he might just take it away
[1:14:33] as he did with Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Where was I at? Verse
[1:14:41] 33.
[1:14:43] That very hour the word was fulfilled
[1:14:45] concerning Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven
[1:14:47] from men and ate grass like oxen. His
[1:14:50] body was wet with dew of heaven and his
[1:14:53] hair till his hair had grown like
[1:14:55] eagle's feathers and his nails like
[1:14:57] bird's claws.
[1:15:00] He was humbled.
[1:15:02] I'll tell you, when you're a child of
[1:15:03] God,
[1:15:06] God will humble you.
[1:15:08] And we better thank God he does.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; He may allow us to fail just like me.
[1:15:14] And I I tell my little story about this
[1:15:20] conference
[1:15:22] this week,
[1:15:25] but he loves me and he allowed me to
[1:15:28] fail. It wasn't a big deal, but he
[1:15:30] allowed me to fail so that I would look
[1:15:33] at myself, examine myself, and say,
[1:15:35] "Lord, I'm sorry. I didn't make it about
[1:15:39] you. I made it about me." My story, my
[1:15:44] testimony with this district attorney.
[1:15:47] It was about her.
[1:15:49] Everything was about how she was looking
[1:15:51] in front of her friends. And then she
[1:15:54] suffered for it. If there would have
[1:15:56] been humility, it would never have
[1:15:58] happened. They would have been blessed.
[1:16:02] But because I believe maybe she is a
[1:16:05] child of God. I know I'm a child of God.
[1:16:07] He allows us to make mistakes. He allows
[1:16:09] us to fail so that we will repent and
[1:16:13] say, "Lord, I was wrong. Now I'm going
[1:16:15] to put you first."
[1:16:18] And at the end of the time, I
[1:16:20] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:16:23] lifted my eyes to heaven and my
[1:16:26] understanding returned to me. And I
[1:16:28] blessed the most high and praised and
[1:16:30] honored him who lives forever. For his
[1:16:32] dominion is an everlasting dominion
[1:16:37] and his kingdom is from generation to
[1:16:39] generation.
[1:16:44] All the inhabitants of the earth
[1:16:47] are reputed does nothing. He does
[1:16:49] according to his will in the army of
[1:16:51] heaven and among the inhabitants of the
[1:16:53] earth.
[1:16:55] No one can restrain his hand.
[1:16:58] What does the King James says? It says,
[1:17:00] "No one can stay his hand."
[1:17:06] Or say unto him, "What doest thou?" Or
[1:17:09] say to him, "What have you done?" None
[1:17:12] of us have a right to do that.
[1:17:17] There was a We can close here and Josiah
[1:17:21] can and the worship team can come. There
[1:17:23] was a lady that I was working with
[1:17:26] and uh she was on my team, scientist,
[1:17:29] and
[1:17:31] she said, "So, you're a pastor?"
[1:17:35] And I I said, "Yeah." And she says, "You
[1:17:38] know, my dad's trying to get me to go
[1:17:39] back to church." She might be watching
[1:17:41] right now. She said, "My dad's trying to
[1:17:43] get me to go back to church." And she's
[1:17:44] my age and she's successful. She's a a
[1:17:48] PhD and and uh very very very successful
[1:17:51] in her career. And she says,
[1:17:56] "I can't stand."
[1:17:59] She says, "I love Jesus." She says, "I
[1:18:03] love what he did. I love what he stood
[1:18:05] for." She says, "But I just every time I
[1:18:09] go to church," she said, "the people are
[1:18:11] so mean to me."
[1:18:13] She says, "They really they they judge
[1:18:15] me.
[1:18:16] And she says, 'I just I can't I I can't
[1:18:19] stand going. She says she says, 'I can
[1:18:21] tell you're different.'
[1:18:24] She said,
[1:18:26] 'You actually, it seems like you care
[1:18:28] for the people and not for your
[1:18:32] narrative or what you're trying to do.
[1:18:34] And uh it was really neat because
[1:18:37] another person on our team, he and I
[1:18:39] were talking about the Lord the whole
[1:18:41] time. And this is just so odd to have
[1:18:44] this group of people together, all of us
[1:18:48] on our team. We're talking about the
[1:18:49] Lord.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; And
[1:18:52] she and she was like, "I'm just I'm
[1:18:54] torn." She says, "I'm confused." And she
[1:18:57] says, "You, my dad gave me a book."
[1:19:00] She said, "Uh, he's he's Baptist now. He
[1:19:02] was Presbyterian before when I was
[1:19:03] growing up, but my dad gave me a book."
[1:19:06] And she said the the title of the book,
[1:19:07] I won't get it exactly right, but I
[1:19:10] would be a Christian if it wasn't for
[1:19:12] the Christians.
[1:19:14] And she said that this book really makes
[1:19:18] sense. She says Jesus what he taught was
[1:19:23] great. She says, but these people don't
[1:19:26] represent him.
[1:19:29] And then the guy that that um the other
[1:19:34] Christians all of us were Christians in
[1:19:36] the room. He said you know he said being
[1:19:41] a Christian is very difficult.
[1:19:44] He said Jesus requires a lot from us. He
[1:19:49] requires really everything.
[1:19:52] And
[1:19:54] the point was these people that say that
[1:19:57] they're Christians, they're just being
[1:20:00] Christians in one aspect of their life
[1:20:02] and they are not being in the other
[1:20:03] aspect of their life. And if we could
[1:20:06] just friends, if we could just be a real
[1:20:08] Christian, if we could just act like
[1:20:11] Jesus acted, if we could just do like
[1:20:13] Jesus taught, if we could prefer our
[1:20:16] brother over ourselves or our neighbor
[1:20:19] over ourselves, if we could just not
[1:20:22] judge when someone comes in, you don't
[1:20:25] know what that person where that person
[1:20:26] comes from. You don't know what that
[1:20:28] person's dealing with. If you if we
[1:20:30] could just reach out like Jesus did with
[1:20:34] Mary Magdalene or with Peter or with the
[1:20:36] other these other rough characters. If
[1:20:38] we would just act like that instead of
[1:20:41] being like this lady experienced
[1:20:46] then things would happen if we would
[1:20:50] just be humble and act in humility like
[1:20:53] these saraphims did before the Lord. And
[1:20:56] I mean covering their faces. It's not
[1:20:58] about me. It's about him. If we would
[1:21:01] just do that,
[1:21:03] then we would see the blessings of God
[1:21:07] just poured down on us. And this man
[1:21:10] Nebuchadnezzar, he got full of himself
[1:21:12] like so many do and say, "I'm important.
[1:21:17] I'm this and I'm that." And they lose
[1:21:20] sight of the humility that God requires.
[1:21:23] And with humility, I promise you, will
[1:21:26] come success in your walk with the Lord.
[1:21:28] If we were just be humble and have
[1:21:31] humility,
[1:21:33] it'll work
[1:21:37] and not offend.
[1:21:39] Be so careful. The Lord Jesus says, "Woe
[1:21:41] unto the world because of offenses." He
[1:21:44] says, "enses must come." But he said,
[1:21:47] "Woe unto them by whom those offenses
[1:21:50] come."
[1:21:53] Humility.
[1:21:55] Friends, it's
[1:21:59] It'll solve the problems I promised.
[1:22:02] It'll make you more successful.
[1:22:06] It'll lead
[1:22:08] those
[1:22:09] people to the Lord that you want to come
[1:22:12] to the Lord. If you were just act like
[1:22:15] those seraraphim act those seraphim
[1:22:17] acted, they looked at each other and
[1:22:18] they were just giving glory to God and
[1:22:21] they had their face covered. It's not
[1:22:23] about me, but it's about what he is.
[1:22:26] And now we can say it's not about me,
[1:22:30] but it's about what he did for me on the
[1:22:35] cross.
[1:22:37] Humble ourselves before the Lord,
[1:22:39] brother Josiah.
[1:22:51] I give myself away.
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:22:58] I give myself away
[1:23:02] so you
[1:23:04] can use me. I give myself away.
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:14] I give myself away
[1:23:18] so you
[1:23:20] can use me. Here
[1:23:27] I am.
[1:23:31] Here I stand.
[1:23:34] Lord, my life
[1:23:38] is in your hands.
[1:23:42] Lord, I'm longing
[1:23:47] to see
[1:23:50] your desires
[1:23:53] revealed
[1:23:55] in me.
[1:23:57] I give myself away.
[1:24:05] I give myself away
[1:24:09] so you
[1:24:11] can't use me. I give myself away.
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I give myself away
[1:24:25] so you
[1:24:27] can use me.
[1:24:32] Oh, take my heart,
[1:24:37] take my life
[1:24:41] as a living
[1:24:45] sacrifice,
[1:24:49] all my dreams,
[1:24:52] all my plans,
[1:24:56] Lord, I place them in your hands.
[1:25:03] I give myself away.
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] I give myself away
[1:25:15] so you
[1:25:17] can use me. I give myself away.
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:26] I give myself away.
[1:25:30] So you
[1:25:32] can use me.
[1:25:36] My life is not my own.
[1:25:39] To you I belong.
[1:25:43] I give myself I give myself to you. Sing
[1:25:48] that again.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; My life is not my own.
[1:25:55] To you I belong.
[1:25:58] I give myself I give myself to you. Sing
[1:26:03] that again. My life.
[1:26:05] Oh my life is not my own.
[1:26:10] To you I belong.
[1:26:14] I give myself I give myself to you. One
[1:26:18] more time. My life. Oh my life is not my
[1:26:23] own.
[1:26:25] To you I belong.
[1:26:29] I give myself I give myself to you.
[1:26:34] I give myself away.
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:42] I give myself away
[1:26:45] so you
[1:26:47] can use me. I give myself away.
[1:26:57] I give myself away
[1:27:00] so you
[1:27:02] can use me.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] That song
[1:27:10] makes me think of this scripture.
[1:27:14] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[1:27:16] the mercies of God, that you present
[1:27:19] your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[1:27:23] acceptable unto God,
[1:27:26] which is your reasonable service.
[1:27:29] And be not conformed to this world, but
[1:27:32] be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:27:35] your mind, that you may prove
[1:27:38] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:27:41] perfect will of God.
[1:27:45] Friends,
[1:27:49] this world teaches us
[1:27:52] not to be humble.
[1:27:55] From the time that that we're born all
[1:27:59] the way through our life, especially
[1:28:02] this world, more than this time, more
[1:28:04] than any other time in history, teaches
[1:28:06] us to exalt ourselves.
[1:28:09] Teaches us to lift ourselves up. lift
[1:28:12] ourselves up in the religious world,
[1:28:14] lift ourselves up in the corporate
[1:28:15] world, lift ourselves up in the public
[1:28:18] world, on on social media. It is
[1:28:20] teaching us to lift ourselves up.
[1:28:24] And when we do that, the humility is
[1:28:27] pushed down. Think about those
[1:28:29] seraraphims
[1:28:31] going before the Lord and they're
[1:28:33] looking at each other
[1:28:36] in awe
[1:28:38] of this mighty God.
[1:28:42] And they're looking at each other and
[1:28:43] they're just crying, "Holy, holy, holy
[1:28:45] unto the Lord." Like us, we can look at
[1:28:49] each other saying, "Can you believe how
[1:28:50] great he is?
[1:28:53] Can you believe what he's done for me?
[1:28:55] Can you believe what he's done for my
[1:28:57] family?
[1:28:59] He is just, he's holy, holy, holy unto
[1:29:03] the Lord." And then we cover our face.
[1:29:06] We go into the closet and pray in
[1:29:09] secret. We go and pray for each other.
[1:29:12] We help each other behind the scenes so
[1:29:15] that nobody knows about it.
[1:29:18] And then God steps on the scene and the
[1:29:21] glory of God comes in and the walls were
[1:29:26] shaken
[1:29:28] because of the power
[1:29:30] and really it was their humility. That's
[1:29:33] what makes those angels so great and
[1:29:37] that's what makes a Christian great is
[1:29:41] humility
[1:29:42] before the Lord and before each other.
[1:29:45] Let's all stand.
[1:29:51] My Jesus, my savior. Shout to the Lord.
[1:29:54] My Jesus,
[1:29:59] my savior.
[1:30:02] Lord, there is none like you.
[1:30:08] All of my days,
[1:30:12] I want to praise
[1:30:16] the wonders of your mighty
[1:30:21] love.
[1:30:23] [Music]
[1:30:27] My comfort,
[1:30:30] my shelter,
[1:30:33] tower of reuge and strength.
[1:30:39] Let every breath
[1:30:42] all that I am
[1:30:46] never cease to worship
[1:30:51] you.
[1:30:55] Shout to the Lord, all the earth. Let us
[1:31:00] sing.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Power and majesty,
[1:31:06] praise to the King.
[1:31:10] Mountains bow down and the seas
[1:31:14] will roar at the sound
[1:31:19] of your name.
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:24] I sing for joy at the work of your
[1:31:29] hands.
[1:31:31] Forever I love you. Forever
[1:31:36] I'll stand.
[1:31:38] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[1:31:45] in you. Let's exalt him this morning.
[1:31:48] Verse one.
[1:31:50] My Jesus,
[1:31:54] my savior.
[1:31:57] Lord, there is none like you.
[1:32:02] All of my days,
[1:32:05] oh, I want to praise
[1:32:09] the wonders of your mighty
[1:32:14] love.
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:19] My comfort,
[1:32:23] my shelter,
[1:32:26] tower of reuge and strength.
[1:32:31] Let every breath
[1:32:34] all that I am.
[1:32:38] Never cease to worship
[1:32:43] you.
[1:32:47] Shout to the Lord, all the earth. Let us
[1:32:51] sing.
[1:32:54] Power and majesty,
[1:32:57] praise to the king.
[1:33:01] Mountains bow down and the seas will
[1:33:05] roar at the sound
[1:33:09] of your name.
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:14] I sing for joy at the work of your
[1:33:19] hands.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Forever I love you. Forever
[1:33:26] I'll stand.
[1:33:28] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[1:33:34] in you.
[1:33:40] Maybe tonight I'll I'll finish on this
[1:33:42] subject and I'll answer at least one of
[1:33:45] the questions that I've received from
[1:33:47] the congregation
[1:33:50] in closing
[1:33:52] heard brother Brandham say one time
[1:33:55] he said talking about the power of God
[1:34:00] and let's think of the humility that God
[1:34:03] has
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; he said do you ever hear the sunrise
[1:34:07] guys.
[1:34:10] And yet, look at all the power in the
[1:34:13] sun. And look at all the power and all
[1:34:15] the gravity of the of the the universe.
[1:34:18] All the power that's in our solar system
[1:34:23] and the sun just comes up quietly.
[1:34:27] No fanfare,
[1:34:29] no no trumpets being blown.
[1:34:33] And then when it starts coming up, the
[1:34:35] roosters start to crow. The birds start
[1:34:38] to sing.
[1:34:40] Life starts to stir around. The night
[1:34:44] animals go back to their place. Light is
[1:34:48] shed. We can see. And all the power of
[1:34:52] that. And it all happened with no sound
[1:34:54] whatsoever.
[1:34:56] How beautiful is our Lord. And think
[1:35:00] about his humility. the humility of God,
[1:35:04] the one that the angels are surrounding.
[1:35:07] When he came to earth, he didn't come as
[1:35:10] a king.
[1:35:12] He didn't come with all the fanfare.
[1:35:15] He came
[1:35:17] to a poor, meaningless couple
[1:35:22] in a meaningless little town called
[1:35:24] Bethlehem.
[1:35:26] born in a meaningless stable with a
[1:35:30] bunch of meaningless animals
[1:35:34] with a bunch of meaningless shepherds up
[1:35:38] on the hill
[1:35:40] and all of these had the greatest honor
[1:35:42] that anyone could ever have. The king of
[1:35:45] glory came down in that baby in all of
[1:35:49] that humility and they got to witness
[1:35:52] it.
[1:35:53] Praise God. Look at the humility in God.
[1:35:55] Now, do you think we should be humble?
[1:35:58] Let's bow our heads. Father, we're
[1:35:59] grateful
[1:36:01] for your goodness to us.
[1:36:05] And Lord,
[1:36:07] we don't like it's hard to be humbled,
[1:36:13] but Lord, it's because of your grace
[1:36:15] that you've done it to us. Lord, give us
