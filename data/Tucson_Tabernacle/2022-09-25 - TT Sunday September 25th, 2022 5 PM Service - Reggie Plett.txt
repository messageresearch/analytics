that he said he will do each morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true and man I like what brother Reggie said this morning about he's the true one not just not false but he's the whole truth it's him he's the one brother brother Noel maybe you could come and we've got a couple needs don't have a lot of needs written in but I was just talking to brother Reggie and his father-in-law brother Gerald Hughes is on his way to India right now and he sends his greetings but also I know that he'd be glad and depend on the Lord helping on him and so he'd appreciate our prayers I know and today I received a text from our brother Colin in Israel and just an update of the work that they're continuing there and I just want to keep them in prayer remember that we're part of this big body that the Lord is doing great things all over the world and my my little boy he heard somebody say it's good to pray for Israel and so now he's the one piping up well we should pray for Israel too and I love that we ought to we ought to not be so self-centered but say Lord bless is your Lord bless my brother my sister amen but we have needs too so for the north you'd come on up let's just stand and if you have a need just lift it up by faith to the Lord that God can meet that need today in his perfect timing whatever it is if you've got a question is the answer of questions so let's look to him [Music] let's all just pray our most gracious and loving Heavenly Father it is always our privilege to come and gather ourselves together Under One Roof and there Lord be able to lift unto you songs of praise and worship unto you and Lord they've come from our heart and so Lord we know that you've accepted them we know Lord you don't look down from heaven because you dwell in each and every one of us and Lord through our eyes you're able to see the things going on in this world and the things going on around about us so Lord we know that you're aware of the situations going on I know in indialor the prime ministers tried to Stamp Out Christianity he's been makes it very difficult for us to go there and to be able to minister and to be able to get money into there but Lord You've placed it on the hearts of different men to go there into that country and their lord offer their assistance Lord by their presence by their preaching by their resources to be able to encourage the brothers and sisters which dwell in that land because lord they're under extreme persecution and they dwell in a landlord and where everybody they worship idols all they do is worship Satan and so Lord there's an oppression that goes with all of that that's going on in India and so I'm thankful Lord that you're able to send some other brothers and sisters into there to encourage them and dislodge them to minister unto them and Minister unto their knees but Lord I think of Ukraine and I hear from different brothers and the things going on there and Lord I hear stories of how of how Rockets have landed in people's front yards but they never detonated so Lord you spared their lives but others have been able to manage to get out of the country and Lord now they need their their needs to be supplied you spoke about these things would be in the end time and Lord we're there it's no longer a future Lord we're in the midst of all of this and so Lord we are in the time when we are going to receive the changing of our bodies we're coming to the time lord when you are going to so Unite with your bride until it's no longer us but it's you living your life through us but Lord as we know dwell in temples of clay Satan attacks these temples but Lord you said that we are healed because Lord you've already paid for the price of that healing and so lordy we ask you to help us to have the faith to accept what you've already purchased for us because lord it's all the work has already been done but Lord and we need you instill within us the faith to be able to accept that which is already accomplished for us so Lord rise our levels of faith and understanding so Lord we can trust you for the very Necessities we have day by day and as the world continues to go into its Darkness Lord we need your light to shine through us so Lord take your light so live in US Lord until your light can shine into a dark world that Lord there are others that are out there that's your seed but Lord they have to see the light so Lord through our Lives May that light so shine Lord that it will shine unto them and and it'll Quicken the seed of God that you place within their lives so they can receive what you have done and they'll be able to join this great body of Jesus Christ of which we're apart and there Lord be able to join into the Bride of Jesus Christ and be able to be a partakers of the Rapture that's Lord soon to take place within our lives be with this in this service Lord I know there's needs within the people I know there's needs around the world but Lord we ask you Lord right now in this body of Christ the Lord through the minister that you have chosen the Lord you would give him the words that he could speak that he would encourage the hearts of the people that that are here and I ask you to Grant this Lord for I asking in Jesus Christ's name [Music] amen let's sing all is well key of G as our brother Reggie prepares to come and deliver what the Lord's put on his heart I believe all is well amen oh [Music] as well we have heard the message shalom all is well there there's a place of perfect grass behind the inner Veil so rest little bride rest for all as well oh is well yes we have heard the message Shalom and all is well and there is there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner bed so rest little bride rest for all his will amen thank the Lord for that true Sabbath that rest that's been given in a Pentecostal experience for each and every one of us amen greetings this evening in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ good to see all of you out and man brother Armando Rivera thank you for bringing these young people here this evening and coming yourself God bless you [Applause] good to have each one if you have your Bibles I'll just have you turn with me into the book of Psalm chapter 16. and we will read verse 11. it says Thou Wilt show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forevermore amen let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer our lovely Lord Jesus we Just Want to Thank You Lord for this opportunity Lord to be healthy enough to come into this house of prayer Lord to Bow our heads before you Lord in honor in reverence Lord in humility to to say before our great king that we love you Lord we Lord are humbled in your presence and Lord we're so grateful that you have promised that where two or three would come and gather together in your name you said you would be there and Lord that's all we are depending upon is for you to be here this evening Lord I pray that for those that could not be here this morning perhaps their home or wherever they would be in in other services ministers ministering in their assemblies I pray God that you would bless them where they are go and meet them Lord where they are at we just ask that Lord you would take this bread of life that Lord you'll break it to each one of us the portion that we have need of we are depending upon you this evening and we just would ask that you would take the preeminence here this evening we surrender it to you we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you can be seated I uh really appreciated the song from the Guerra sisters and I I'm a little uh not not upset but disappointed that you never did that before and I'm we're going to have words after words to be hiding a talent like that like you have and then to pass it off as if they couldn't do that ever again and that was a real blessing my father is the Ancient of Days and I as I began to think about that in the back my eyes begin to tear up just to think that I have a father who's who through the since the dawn of time he knows our needs he's seen our needs before he's met others that have had the same needs that we've got and I'm so grateful that he knows that just comforts you you know when you feel alone and and uh or you're in pain and and but to know that he knows it means a lot this evening uh I read this scripture brother Branham used this scripture uh in a message called the path of life and uh this evening we want to minister a sermon called give life and I want to jump right in I I really said it in my heart tonight to make a deal with sister Elizabeth Guerra to take the time off that I I overspent on this morning's sermon and go ahead and cut it off of this evening's sermon so I hope that it works out I will warn all of the young people here I I'm not so good at it I I've failed many of times when I made promises like that so um but Lord help us this evening ah brother random in this message he's speaking to ministers and a Minister's meeting I believe is is where this message is taking place and he says brethren I believe that we have the thing that the world must have but we got to approach it in a way what if you were a carpenter now I stopped right there I don't want you reading on ahead of me I don't like when you all are already know what I'm about to say I was a carpenter before I did artificial grass I was a carpenter and brother Branham is about to get into what if you were a carpenter and so to uh that right away stirs me up because I know okay I know what that means I know what it is to be a carpenter I know what it is to be a builder but brother random is saying Brothers we have what the world needs and I hope that you believe that I hope that you believe that we've got as brother Brandon said in one place we've got the answer to the devil's question we've got that and I believe that I believe that the thing that that that Holy Spirit that quickened germ inside that's living inside of you is what the world is looking for it's the reason Elon Musk is going to Mars they they want to know how can we live how can a person live what how in the way that this world is going how can we live in the they can see themselves we're destroying one another and we're really robbing this planet of its resources and and how is it that we're going to live and we've got the answer we know how we're gonna live we know where we're gonna live we know what the size of that place is going to be we know who's going to be there and who's not going to be there we've got those answers but brother Branham says it's all in the approach so young people listen I've got a 15 year old I've got a 14 year old I've got a 10 year old I've got a three-year-old and their daddy is a preacher but he's still a daddy he's still dead and to the teenagers I want to be friend I want to be buddy and there's so many times I want to make a point to my children I really want to get something to them I want to tell them how much I love them and and and and how the uh you know when the room isn't clean how I'm disappointed but I still love them but all that seems to come out is how disappointed I am so how do I get through to them that I love them it's all in the approach it's all in the approach so brother Brandon says now if he was a carpenter imagine you're a carpenter just take them in on the end here or brother borders over there's a carpenter I believe well what if he was driving with a hammer like this and driving nails and I had an automatic Hammer of some sort that I pour a keg of nails into and hold it up like this and and drive them boards up like that a whole lot better than he could with his hammer well that's called a nail gun today and we know what that is anybody that's done any framings like that Hitachi give me my Hitachi gotta have that Hitachi pass loader you know well what if you had one of those but you were talking to the Amish guy who doesn't have that and he's just nailing them up with just his 16 penny nails in a in a you know in a big stiletto hammer and he's driving those Nails in just by hand and you go hey I've got a I've got a nail gun duh brother Brandon saying now if I walk up to him and say ah boy you're not even in it you know nothing about it while you're mashing in your fingers Ma you just haven't got a product to begin with I'm offending him I'll never sell the hammer that's right see it's my Approach with what I have my product I know is better than what he's got but I've got to remember I got to approach him in the right way now I stop right there we all said amen we believe we've got what the world needs now how do we sell it to him how are we doing if I walk up to the person in the world say you've got the Holy Ghost well then you don't know you're just a you're dead you're dead it's where you stand you Hit the Road Jack it's the approach our sermon is give life and I suppose I could say this is a sermon for the ministry for you ministers that are in this building tonight this is for you but I could say fathers that have children and mothers that have children that desire them to receive this is for you and then I would say to you young people if you've got a friend that you just are yearning for them to to see the light this is for you and if you've got a co-worker that you know needs the Lord he's just he's tried every other way to satisfy his life but you know he needs the Lord I suppose this is for you so I I suppose then this evening it's for us all okay and if I walk up to him and say how do you do sir my name is Branham mine is borders I see you're a carpenter yes yes sir I am I really believe you're a real Carpenter too yes I was watching the way he was handling your Hammer oh yes oh Betsy has been with me a long time many of us that have been in carpentry we name our hammers I say yeah that's a good one yeah sure good too and you can really handle it yeah you know we just we used to do hammer tricks when we were framing you could spin our Hammers and then we would spin it and then turn it and spin it this way and then we'd throw it down in the into the loop that was what we did to entertain ourselves after we mashed our fingers go ahead talk to him a while I say it did you ever hear of the new such and such a hammer no I don't believe I ever did well here it is you put your nails in here and let's just tack those boards up up down there look at the time this does and what a product I've got show it to them like that say take it try it for a few days and see what you think about it it'll be I'll be back see if it's the right kind of a product it'll sell itself you know what I mean don't you brethren see see we got the right thing we got to approach the people with it right see that's the thing see it's the real genuine thing this is the holy spirit I believe it with all my heart I don't believe that Brethren are Renegades I believe their brethren I do not believe that the spirit that does the discernment is any soothsayer I believe it's the Holy Spirit revealing himself in his church just making the church come to its place oh my that does my heart so good to hear that that the world which when you would want to share with them the discernment or the gift that God sent this generation when he sent the gift in brother Branham we look at that and say what this is the most glorious gift to hit our generation a man who could look into somebody's life and say you live it such and such an address you've been to the doctor one two three four five surgeries but the doctor says he can't do anything for you thus saith the Lord go home in your will hear that and we think this is the most glorious thing I've ever heard in my life and the world says that's a witch doctor you go that's not the response I was looking for I was really hoping you were gonna say yeah that's really wonderful but instead you get the response I don't know about that I've seen a lot of fanaticism like that I don't know I'm gonna hold off no problem you ever experience the moving of the Holy Ghost you just try it on a few days I'll come around in a couple days I'll be around why because I love you I will be checking in on you again because I'm genuinely concerned about you I will be checking back in now unless we're wanting to rubber stamp a bunch of Believers in this world and just everybody at work come here Palm hella ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost yeah did my job that's not what we're doing you start meeting people at work you start meeting people at school you somebody comes in walks into your church you think oh there's a stranger in here oh they kind of smell funny oh they look funny I don't know about them you know after church somebody goes up to them and says you know what's your story where are you from would you why'd you come into our church well here's the thing I'm lonely I I you know I'm broke I'm looking for God most of all my soul is hungry suddenly your heart begins to bleed you say oh man well you do the best you can you know you got a place to stay you know you're I can give you some money you know we're not made of money but I can give you some we can get you to a hotel we can you know help you get a haircut get a shower you know whatever but but what was that last thing you said I'm lonely and I'm looking for God okay I got something that you can try on for a few days and see if you like how about that I'll tell you what it sells itself I'm thinking about selling putting lawns in some of your front yards and then I'm in a year I'm gonna come take them away and then we'll see how much you loved it and then I know I'll have sold an artificial grass job at your house when I rip it out of your yard in a year it works I met a man one time he said best car salesman I ever met I was just buying a car from an individual no no he said it was a dealership he said I walked into that dealership he said I really couldn't even afford a new car he said but that dealer didn't come over you know how the dealers do when you go walk onto a car lot and you can like see them coming you know right out of the swamps you know slithering over we said this car salesman just kind of stood off and he said you know you're looking for any certain car well you know I was looking at this one and he just took the keys and he threw it to the guy and he said take it home for a couple days come back tell me what you think what you think he goes I bought that car he said I couldn't even afford that car but I bought it he said because that man knew how to sell a car he just said try it for a couple days and you might find that you like it I've got to tell you that growing up on under the Pew as a little baby and then finally up on the pew and around the Pew you know as your toddler but finally up on the Pew as a young person I've heard about the Holy Ghost so much I could finish quotes for you I could finish scriptures for you I could do all of that but then I met him and he didn't force himself on me but he just offered himself to me and it changed my life changed my heart change my desires if we could just have some way that we could take the whole Pentecostal move and just break down our little barriers and a place to come together and set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus to which we're baptized in by one Spirit oh I think that there would be manifestations that had never been known before and if we could approach the Methodist the Baptist the Pentecostals could go everywhere to every place I believe it could be done oh my I would just love and I would just love to see a Baptist receive this I would love to see a Methodist receive this love to see Catholic receive this I'd love to see a Pentecostal receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'd love to see it and it can be done here we are back in Romans Romans chapter 10 I'm going to just read verses one to eight and I just kind of want to emphasize really these first two verses really really three verses Brethren my heart's desire now this is Paul Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness now we already hit that this morning we know that's Christ and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth for Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them that that's the word of God but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from heaven or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach my heart's desire for my children is that they be saved heart's desire for my employees is that they'd be saved my heart's desire for every person I come and I see sitting on a pew that they be saved and I want to be able to convey it to them I want to be able to approach every individual that I come in contact in life not with the rubber stamp but with a life with a real life of what are you going through what is happening in your life can I relate to that or do I know someone who can and then if we can I enter in with you can I join with you in helping you overcome and if I can't do I know somebody who can and would you want would you want it would you want to know them and would you want the help in any way in any aspect of life would you want it now Pride Keeps Us Pride's a big one keeps a lot of us from accepting a lot of things we end up doing that to ourselves and I don't mean just in church I mean in life keeps us from from receiving a lot of help sometimes it's pride and then sometimes it's it's it's shame it's we're ashamed I'm ashamed I don't want to let him in I don't want to let him know ah if they found out that uh what would they think of me but let that thing Fester a while in your life and one day you'll cry out I need help and you may not cry out to that person but hopefully you'll cry out to God and maybe God will send that person again or maybe he'll deliver your you instantly or send somebody else but God is his whole desires that we'd be whole that's my desire now we read here Psalm 16 11. now we'll show me the path of life thou Wilt show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forevermore brother Branham says oh excuse me David here was speaking of Life thou will show me the path of Life did you notice it will you show me or could you show me I hope you show me thou will show me I believe that everyone that God has called will hear and will come if you feel tonight I believe that I have this unction or there's something that is calling me to God well do you who do you think it is that's doing that Satan I don't think so so who is it that's giving you that tug in your heart that's giving you a call to God it's God Desiring to show you and me the path of life the path of life now listen what brother Branham says here I believe that that's what we're facing now in our meeting we can only sow the seed some will fall by the wayside sure we know that some will fall One Way some fall another but some will fall on good ground that's right show me the path of life now I'll stop here only to say this for the parents the advice that you offer your children sometimes will fall on deaf ears sometimes will fall on stubborn ears sometimes we'll fall I don't know on distracted ears but sometimes it'll fall in good ears that doesn't mean we give up as parents and say they're bad eggs hope not now life is the greatest thing that we could achieve there's nothing no greater than life who life now remember brother Brandon went in that hotel and there was a New Year's Eve there was those two girls steps out of the elevator they're drinking saying whoopee this is life and he tried to grab their hands and say girls that's not life death but let me show you real life and it was like get away from me you creep that's not life if I could go to Glory this morning and we could go up and go could all go up there and I could meet Abraham what's the greatest thing there is Abraham he'd say life there no matter what anything else is life is the greatest thing that anyone can achieve his life what would you give for life I believe it was random gives an example of a book that was written and there was some person famous person who said I would give everything for five more minutes of life and I want you to know it was oh Steve Jobs the creator of Microsoft the creator of Apple Microsoft not Microsoft Macintosh right mac Apple Steve Jobs died here a few years ago a young man in it by by by means of all you know the ages he was a young man considering I think he may have been the wealthiest man at the time he knew he was dying he had cancer and he knew he was dying he said I'd give every penny I had for 10 more minutes of life life that's just a man talking about natural living life what we're talking about is eternal life eternal life it's the greatest thing somebody could achieve eternal life it's the greatest thing it's what we're long for and you know what as far as your natural life I would ask that God would give you the fullest life that you could ever experience in the natural but if in the end you you had the fullest of life to know that when you go in that grave that is that is it I feel bad for you be happy that you got to live the kind of life that you thought was real full but I'd be real sad but for that person who knows that if my life is short if my life is is suffering and my life is miserable but to know that when when this life is over when this flesh drops into the Earth I've got I I I've only just begun living I've just started this eternal walk with God who buddy you have achieved brother random uses this quote so many times to know him is life you'll hear him say it over and over again not to know your Creed is life not even to know the Bible is life he says but to know him is life and he quotes it as if there's like it's a direct scripture and I looked for it and I couldn't find it but I found this John 14 6 Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me John 17 3 chapters later he's praying and he says and this is life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ whom now has sent to know him is life to know God not to speculate of what is God where is God how could God but to know God but to say I know God that's a real presumptuous statement in the minds of all the scientists of this world how dare you but brother sister when I'm eating an apple and I ask you is this apple sweet or sour you say I don't know I'm not eating it I say that's right I'm the one eating it I know if this Apple's sweet or sour and when you meet Jesus Christ and you know him as God then you say to know God I know him I know God Rebrand goes on and he's telling a story his mother just passed away recently his sister Dolores he says Dolores called me and she said Billy I just can't get over it she said mother I said Dolores look out across the road from where you live isn't there a large oak tree standing there she said yes this is just a few days before mother died she said yes I said it's coming fall now I said about a month ago those leaves were real pretty and green yes she said bill I said when was what does it look like now she said well they're yellow and brown and green red I said Dolores what makes them turn yellow brown green and red she said they're dying I said when was the tree its prettiest she said now I said the Bible said precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints see that's when the time comes I said the life is going back life is a tree we're all hanging on a tree of life that's right now the imagery is in your head right now you see the tree and you see the leaves and you know about the Turning of the colors not not the saguaros but like the oak tree and I got to tell you up in Flagstaff I know it's coming fall and a part of me is so happy to see those beautiful colors so pretty we just love to take people and let's go up into the Aspens let's go look at the leaves turning and get graduation pictures and the Aspen leaves and we love that but I know what's coming next and part of my anxiousness begins to come up within me because it's going to get cold Winter's coming and I begin to get nervous but it's fall again we're coming into fall again and every year it comes and every year it goes life is a tree we're all hanging on a tree of life about 50 paragraphs later brethren we are hanging on the tree of life and someday this old Leaf is going to drop off but there will come a resurrection someday a great Millennium lays ahead of us a great Resurrection we'll come back again someday because we have eternal life we understand it from the way of a word if we had time you know how it is we could approach it by many ways people sometime you have to use different methods to get to a person hey I I love that we're not all the same we're individuals and we each can can can can understand things in different ways I've met so many people who say you know I'm an audible learner I I learn by by hearing I you know I have to have an Autumn I have to hear an audio book going for me to understand I can't read I can't sit and read a book I'm not real good at it I have to have it played for me and then I really soak up more I've seen I've heard uh people argue you know for me I have to sit in front of a TV all the time I'm going I don't I that's tough for me to believe but okay but we all learn different ways now brother Branham goes on and he tells a story I'm gonna be I'm gonna be sure sister Beth I'm gonna be sure I know you're gonna have words with me afterwards too okay as a landscaper the lesson from the tree I get it see it all the time I understand it I used to you could probably catch me out in the middle of somebody's property on a good spring day when the wind is howling you used to probably catch me saying words verbally out loud like I'm a crazy person and punching and fighting and throwing things and somebody would probably look out their window of their house going what is wrong with that guy out there but the wind when you're shoveling out a ditch to put in a water line or something and you throw a whole shovel full of dirt that way and the wind just carries it right back into your eyeballs I think God why did you allow wind to exist and then you go home and you're not only sunburned but wind burned and you're putting aloe vera on your face and laying in bed tenderly going why the wind why the wind and your windows are shaking going why the wind and you're just grading and then I heard brother Branham say that the wind is for the growth of the trees that the Wind Blows the tree and all that weight up top in the top of the tree shakes the tree and it causes the dirt underneath around the roots to get loose it Wiggles a little bit of room in the soil so now the roots can expand Now The Roots can go longer and when I heard brother Branham say that I never complained about the winning no I can't say that I never complained but instead while I was gritting my teeth in the Wind I said Thank you Lord for the growth thank you for the trials in life that help the trees to grow deeper and more in love with you now I can understand now from Landscaping I can learn from the things like the trees I understand us hanging on a tree of life like a leaf and as I get older I understand the seasons of Life getting older and the life going back and one day those trees and those leaves they drop off and when you begin losing friends who go home to be with the Lord and you recognize those leaves falling off of the tree you really begin to understand what that is but the lesson of that tree coming back again and those leaves coming back again the next spring to know that that tree's Not Dead that tree's alive and there will be life again and brothers and sisters that's how now I can understand eternal life not uh uh uh what is uh the the the belief of uh coming coming back is something else reincarnation but Resurrection now I put this up here a nice beautiful tree nice and green and you see the root system of that tree and that's a good healthy tree look at that so flourishing and that's you young people so healthy and then we get to fall and though that's a root system if you just cover up that bottom green part it just looks like a tree at the end of fall that's lost all its leaves while there's green leaves full trees on this part of the Earth on another part of the Earth there's this now right now we're getting pretty close up in Flagstaff if you want to come visit before too long it you'll still get leaves but after hearing a little bit that's what flagstaff's gonna look like the trees up in Flagstaff but you know that it's becoming into fall here now but down in Australia they're coming into spring they're just working on this and brother sister we can't afford to let people that we love and who Christ has died for get away from this life to die without life eternal let's do everything we can should have I should have highlighted that let's do everything we can to get them into that place where they can rise again in the resurrection thou will show me the path of life there are some things we can't do baby but the things that we can do the things that God has given you the gifts God has given you get our sisters brother Reggie each and every one of you the things that God has given you want to use it to try to give life in Ezekiel chapter 37 verses 3 through 5 and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered O Lord God thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth there's a story there's a musical group their name is Phillips Craig and Dean and they're all pastors and uh the Phillips part of the group I forgot his name but something Phillips they wrote a song and the story behind this song went like this there was a patient Mrs Johnson who went in for uh heart condition heart surgery open heart surgery and you may have heard this story this happened some time ago and the surgeon went in opened up the chest cavity took her heart did the repairs that he could with the surgery and then he began to massage the heart he put the heart back into the chest cavity but he began to real softly begin to massage the heart and and by hand pump on that heart and this is and that's factual they really do do that and they begin to massage the heart to get it beating again and it wouldn't beat again now normally it would it just this would this process worked in an open heart surgery but it wouldn't wouldn't work her heart was not beating again so they took a little bit more drastic measures and still the heart would not beat and the story is that the surgeon leaned down next to the patient who's laying on the table unconscious and he whispered in her ear and he said Mrs Johnson I just want you to know the surgery was performed and it was successful but now I need you to tell your heart to beat again and immediately her heart began beating again and I tell that story because though we want to reach out for those that have yet heard the word of God though we want to give life though we want to be able to approach them in such a way that they would desire the baptism of the Holy Ghost there are some people who've experienced it and they're walking in it and they're sitting in the church and they've been there years and years and years and they know about the things of God and they love God but devastational things have happened in their life hard things have happened and as much as we want new life as much as we want the new life to come on this tree and we want this tree to grow out we want new leaves and we want longer branches and we want this tree to grow Fuller what we don't want to see is the tree the leaves that have been there for years to drop off to die to be cut short prematurely some people know what that feels like like you've had a real heart damage in your own church brother Branham said in one of those earlier quotes I believe these brothers are real brothers they're not Renegades not Renegades they're Brothers and I could safely honestly I could safely say before you here this evening that every one of the ministers that's in this room I want to tell you that I believe their desire is to give life I believe if they've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they understand and they they're recognizing the day their day and their message they're recognizing where we're living they understand they they believe would you believe and maybe they approach things differently than the way you would approach things and and so many times somebody's offended at something they would say but ultimately I believe they're Brothers I believe their desire is to give life sometimes we can be damaged in church we can get hurt real hurt and it's it's more those those pains in church that I would think of God the great surgeon the great physician leaning down to us and and whispering to us in service tell your heart to beat again I know your heart's been damaged there's a broken heart syndrome is a real thing people die of tell your heart to beat again surgery was successful the surgery was successful God's A Healer God's a provider we believe that now tell your heart to beat again speak to those Dry Bones speak prophesy the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth tell your heart to beat again brother Branham makes this statement as my last statement sister Beth so we can have words here shortly in a few minutes okay he says say God say God it's the truth and there alone I stand God your word is true I believe it I'm standing upon that and let that just keep in here until it drops down into here from your head to your heart and becomes a reality then it'll work now don't try to pretend don't try to kid yourself don't say it did it dropped it dropped you'll know it'll work itself it'll sell itself you don't have to convince anybody that it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will bear itself record if it dropped from here to here it will bear fruit it will you drink more than your allotted portion and it will push out fruit Let It Drop from here to here and becomes a reality then it'll work only can it work when it comes to the heart I heard it said one time I I thought brother Branham said it I couldn't find it I would love for you Brothers to find it and come and and give it to me so that I could pin it and and tag it but I heard it say somebody say it like this one time the greatest distance that God has got to travel is that 18 inches from here to here not from the other end of the universe not from that far-off Galaxy that the JW Webb is trying to find that other uh in infinite reality that's yours from here to here it'll only work when it drops down into here I just love that brother Branham I just love that brother Brandon would say when he was talking about brother Billy Graham how the brother Billy said it's you preachers it's you lazy preachers got your feet up on the desks brother Branham made it clear and he said it's not it's they're not taking them far enough it's taking somebody not just to a Justified condition not just to a Sanctified condition but all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the way introducing them all the way to A Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever not a historic Jesus not a story of a Jesus not a picture of a Jesus not an icon of a Jesus but an actual the real person of the of Jesus Christ in this day the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when somebody really fully truly meets him and and and receives that life into themselves that's when they can rest and it's no longer wrestling up here this is the greatest battle ever fought we know is is is up here but when it's settled is when it comes down into here and you say the battle is won the battle I was having that battle has been won now will there be more yes there will be more but when it drops from here to here that one will be won and when the next one comes and that one and and and the turmoil comes up in here and it drops from here to here that one will be one and it will be a life of overcoming it will be a life of battles one because it's dropped from here to here say Lord I believe it I'm standing upon it and then let it drop Let It Drop what is that going to take brother is that going to take a few minutes in prayer maybe is it going to take a few hours maybe maybe a week maybe as Abraham would say 25 years but if you can stand upon the word of God it will come to pass we want to give life I want life I want life for our children I want life for our young people I want life in our churches and for those that are saying I've got I I've been damaged I've been hurt I want life for you too I want your youth to be renewed like the eagles to be able to rise up on the wings like an eagle amen God bless you this evening let's stand together I wonder if the musicians would come you know the goodness of God goodness of God yeah I wonder if you would just bow your heads and prayer with me precious Heavenly Father Lord the greatest thing that a person could achieve is life life Lord we can read between the lines we can understand what's being said there God gives us so much joy when we watch our children enjoying life to see them go places and make friends God to accomplish the things that they accomplish in their school and their life God his parents are we feel good Lord our greatest joy is to see when our children receive the Lord when they receive that eternal life oh God it puts our hearts at ease Lord we think the same for the young people we think the same in our churches we think of the same for The Sinner that came in and it was going One Direction and Lord how you turn his life around and you clean them up and you fill them God you set him on fire oh Lord how we love to watch them burn Lord with their spirit Lord I just pray Lord for God my brother Armando his congregation these young people of his Lord I stand with my brother shoulder to shoulder I want you to know that together is brethren Brothers Lord as sons of God look at brother Noel Johnson brother Lyle brother Aaron Guerra or brother Peter God the ministers here brother Dan Evans out preaching God it's it's our desire that we would see life that we could give life we could be like Dr Peter on the day of Pentecost with the prescription what shall we do to be saved repent repent turn away turn around quit going the way you're going repent about face be baptized with the spirit of God not by handshake not with a name on a book but a full baptism of the Holy Spirit take on that name of Mrs Jesus Christ don't ever be that old rotten person that that old man you were married to before let that man die and let this new man Christ Jesus live out of you that's our desire God is ministers or his parents as friends as colleagues Lord we want to see life we want to see life Lord we've seen so many God that had that life and Lord they it was a season that they've dropped off but God we know they're on the other side they're living in that that eternal life tree thank you and oh God we desire Lord that with this tree would be fruitful this tree would be healthy tree would not be choked but this tree would not be hurt by some some some bug that would come and eat at it but God that life life would be in this last day bride that fruit would be ripe and not rotten and not eaten by the yellow jackets but God they'd be healthy and every year God every fall we could come back and we could see each other and say oh we've had a good harvest we've had a good harvest God is sadding to the church daily and God is saving lives and young people are being filled and they want to live for God they want to live a a good life a happy life but most importantly a life for God oh Lord that's our desire [Music] I pray for those feel damaged
