[26:48] going to Sprint through Joshua we're
[26:50] going to get an overview of its contents
[26:52] there's going to be a lot of reading but
[26:55] before we do let's pray once again again
[26:57] to the one who inspired the unknown and
[27:00] unnamed author of this book lord Jesus
[27:04] we are so grateful that we can be
[27:05] gathered here this evening thank you
[27:07] Lord for these people that have come
[27:10] each of us that are here Lord because
[27:12] it's the last week of the year it's the

[27:19] care to tell you how much you mean to us
[27:21] Lord forgive us where we have fallen
[27:23] short today Lord and let our hearts just
[27:26] draw together and draw dra to your word
[27:28] and draw from it what you have for us
[27:30] this evening Lord you you put it there
[27:32] for a purpose and you put it there for a
[27:33] purpose for us tonight in this place we
[27:36] thank you Lord and we thank you and we
[27:40] thank you again in Jesus precious name
[27:45] Amen in the simplest summary this book
[27:48] covers Israel's history During the
[27:49] period from the death of Moses to the
[27:52] incomplete conquest of Canaan under
[27:55] Joshua and the apportionment of the
[27:57] lands to to the various ancestral
[27:58] lineages of Jacob's
[28:01] sons as a person Joshua is is an
[28:05] inspiring story Moses faithful servant
[28:08] and follower the one who wholeheartedly
[28:11] believes in trusting the Lord's word
[28:14] becomes a new leader the rise of Joshua
[28:18] yahoshua in Hebrew the same name as
[28:20] Jesus thus parallels the one that we
[28:23] know as Jesus Moses commissioned Joshua
[28:26] to lead the people was recorded in
[28:28] Deuteronomy 31:7 Moses called unto
[28:32] Joshua and said unto him in the sight of
[28:35] all Israel be strong and of a good
[28:38] courage for thou must go with his people
[28:41] unto the land which the Lord has sworn
[28:43] unto their fathers to give them and thou
[28:46] shalt cause them to inherit it and the
[28:49] Lord he it is that death go before thee
[28:52] he will be with thee he will not fail
[28:54] thee neither forsake thee fear not
[28:58] neither be
[29:00] dismayed Paul recounts an early victory
[29:03] in the conquest as he shares examples of
[29:06] faith in Hebrews 11 we read in verse 30
[29:08] by faith the walls of Jericho fell down
[29:13] after they were compassed about seven
[29:18] days somewhat sadly the Book of Joshua
[29:21] also records the planting of the seeds
[29:23] of fulfillment of the prophecy Moses
[29:25] recorded in Deuteronomy 31 and 32 a
[29:28] prophecy of failure and ultimate
[29:31] ejection from Canaan also in the same
[29:33] portion of Deuteronomy as Joshua's
[29:36] commission we read in verse 16 of
[29:39] chapter 31 the Lord said unto Moses
[29:41] behold Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers
[29:45] and this
[29:46] people will rise up and go whing after
[29:49] the gods of the strangers of the land
[29:51] whether they go to be among them and
[29:54] will forsake me and break my Covenant
[29:56] which I have made with
[29:58] them Paul addressing the Galatians
[30:01] Echoes the lesson of Joshua to his
[30:03] contemporaries some 1500 years later in
[30:06] Galatians 5 we read starting at verse 7
[30:08] you did run well who did hinder you that
[30:12] you should not obey the truth this
[30:16] persuasion cometh not of him that
[30:17] calleth you but pointing to one of the
[30:20] root causes in galatia and as we'll
[30:23] discover in the Book of Joshua he
[30:25] summarizes a little 11
[30:28] Levens the whole
[30:29] lump like the story starting with the
[30:32] Exodus Joshua shows that strong Godly
[30:34] leadership is necessary but by itself
[30:39] insufficient we each regardless of our
[30:43] gifts or calling must possess faith and
[30:48] once possessing it we must exercise it
[30:53] Joshua is not simply a history it's a
[30:56] warning that speaks to us across
[30:59] centuries and
[31:01] Millennia please be
[31:05] seated we can sometimes look at that at
[31:07] being a little kind of sad about the
[31:10] future failures that happen but you
[31:12] know the Jewish people say that the the
[31:16] five books of Moses were written to
[31:17] bring the law so that they could uh
[31:20] please God if you will but but really I
[31:23] think when you look at the end of
[31:24] Deuteronomy and where Moses is talking
[31:26] about the failure what they're really
[31:27] doing what God is really doing is not
[31:29] bringing them to the law he's trying to
[31:32] bring them through the
[31:35] law to The Ultimate Gift the ultimate
[31:39] Grace the ultimate recognition that we
[31:42] have to try we have to do all that we
[31:43] can but we can't depend on what we do we
[31:46] have to depend on him I should get back
[31:49] to my notes we're going to run out of
[31:50] time The Book of Joshua can be thought
[31:52] of as having three components the first
[31:55] is a narrative of the physical movements
[31:56] of the people the the battles with the
[31:58] Canaanites and so
[32:00] forth the second component is geographic
[32:04] it describes a division of the land
[32:06] including the internal borders between
[32:08] the various Clans or or tribes this
[32:11] includes a listing of the pasture lands
[32:13] and towns for the Levites scattered
[32:15] throughout the territory as well as
[32:18] Cities of
[32:19] Refuge the land a gift from God is
[32:24] divided by
[32:25] lot similarly
[32:27] the gifts of the Spirit in our lives are
[32:30] at the Lord's discretion we don't get to
[32:33] pick and
[32:34] choose he's not a tool in our toolbox
[32:38] we're Tools in his toolbx the third part
[32:41] is a warning and encouragement to trust
[32:45] in the Lord and to keep the
[32:48] faith a heads up here Joshua is full of
[32:53] violence we look on it 7500 miles miles
[32:57] away and 3,400 years later as as a type
[33:01] or as a lesson but for the people in
[33:04] Canaan at that time it was not symbolic
[33:08] it was horrific it was physical it was
[33:11] real for each Victory mentioned there
[33:14] were terrible consequences for those
[33:16] over whom the victory was won if nothing
[33:19] else Joshua should help us truly
[33:21] appreciate the grace of God in our lives
[33:25] and the blessing we have to be Here and
[33:28] Now rather than there and
[33:31] then at least I'm grateful for that
[33:34] Joshua has a total of 24 chapters if you
[33:37] listen to the voice message this morning
[33:39] our pastor read to us a large chunk of
[33:41] uh of one of the last of those chapters
[33:43] so we'll be able to save a little time
[33:45] this evening because we've all
[33:48] remembered exactly what he said when you
[33:49] listen to that this morning but we'll
[33:52] proceed through each of these chapters
[33:53] reading from some summarizing others be
[33:56] aware that the chapters and the events
[33:59] described in them are often not in
[34:02] chronological order often can be
[34:05] confusing starting what a good place to
[34:08] start Joshua how about 1 one now after
[34:11] the death of Moses the servant of the
[34:13] Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke
[34:15] unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[34:17] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[34:21] now therefore arise go over this Jordan
[34:25] thou and all the people unto the land
[34:28] which I do give them even to the
[34:30] children the descendants of Israel
[34:33] skipping to verse 5 there shall not any
[34:35] man be able to stand before thee all the
[34:38] days of thy life as I was with Moses so
[34:42] I will be with thee I will not fail thee
[34:45] nor forsake thee be strong and of a good
[34:50] courage For unto this people shalt thou
[34:53] divide for an inheritance the land which
[34:55] I swear unto their fathers to give them
[34:59] skipping to verse nine have not I
[35:01] commanded thee be strong and of a good
[35:04] courage Be not Afraid neither be thou
[35:08] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[35:10] thee whether soever thou
[35:13] goest multiple words of encouragement
[35:17] and repeated strong courageous Fearless
[35:21] the Lord is with thee now we just read
[35:24] verse 9 the entirety of chapter 2 Falls
[35:27] between verses 9 and 10 chronologically
[35:30] but we'll just go ahead and read 10 and
[35:32] then we'll get into chapter 2 here
[35:34] pretty quick then after the events
[35:36] recorded in Chapter 2 Joshua commanded
[35:38] the officers of the people
[35:41] saying pass through the host command the
[35:44] people saying prepare you victuals for
[35:47] within three days ye shall pass over
[35:49] this Jordan and go in to possess the
[35:51] land which the Lord your God giveth you
[35:54] to possess it Jos josua then reminds the
[35:58] descendants of Reuben God and Manasseh
[36:01] whose land grant was east of the Jordan
[36:03] that they promised to help their
[36:05] relatives secure the territory west of
[36:07] the Jordan they renew their pledge to do
[36:10] so and in chapter two we read Joshua the
[36:15] son of nun sent out to shittum two men
[36:18] to spy secretly saying go view the land
[36:21] even Jericho and they went and came unto
[36:25] an harlot's house named Rahab and lodged
[36:28] there and verse four the woman took the
[36:31] two men and hid them and when questioned
[36:34] as they hid said thus to the local
[36:36] authorities who were inquiring did you
[36:38] see these two guys there came men unto
[36:41] me but I didn't know where they were
[36:43] from skipping to verse n and after she
[36:48] misdirected the authorities which left
[36:50] she said unto the men I know that the
[36:52] Lord hath given you the land and that
[36:54] your terror is Fallen upon us and that
[36:57] all the inhabitants of the land faint
[36:59] because of you for we have heard how the
[37:02] Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea
[37:06] for you when you came out of Egypt and
[37:08] what you did un the two kings of the
[37:10] amorites that were on the other side
[37:12] Jordan Sion and OG whom he utterly
[37:15] destroyed as soon as we heard these
[37:18] sayings our hearts melted neither did
[37:21] there remain any more courage in any man
[37:24] because of you for the Lord you your God
[37:28] he is God in heaven above and in Earth
[37:33] beneath she extracts a promise that
[37:36] she'll be protected when Israel attacks
[37:38] Jericho and the spies replied in verse
[37:40] 18 behold when we come into the land
[37:44] Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet
[37:46] thread representing danger safety
[37:49] through atonement in the window which
[37:52] thou did let us down by and thou shalt
[37:54] bring thy father and thy mother and thy
[37:56] brethren and all thy father's household
[37:58] home unto thee and it shall be when we
[38:01] attack and capture this city that
[38:04] whosoever shall go out of the doors of
[38:06] thy house into the
[38:09] street his blood shall be upon his head
[38:12] and we will be Guiltless and whosoever
[38:14] shall be with thee in the house his
[38:16] blood shall be on our head if any hand
[38:17] be upon
[38:19] him and furthermore if thou utter if you
[38:22] warn anyone about our business then
[38:24] we'll be free of this oath with which
[38:26] you've made us to Swear to protect
[38:29] you and she said according to your words
[38:33] so be it and she sent them away and they
[38:36] departed and she bound the Scarlet line
[38:39] in the
[38:41] window and they went and came unto the
[38:45] mountain and Abode there three days
[38:46] until the pursuers the folks that were
[38:49] out looking for them had returned the
[38:51] pursuer sought them throughout all the
[38:52] way but found them not so the Two Men
[38:56] return turned descended from the
[38:58] mountain came to Joshua the son of nun
[39:00] and told them all things that befell
[39:01] them they said unto Joshua truly the
[39:04] Lord hath delivered into our hands all
[39:06] the land for even all the inhabitants of
[39:09] the country do faint because of
[39:13] us in chapter three the nation crosses
[39:16] the Jordan River from the East to the
[39:18] West at verse 7 we read the Lord said
[39:21] unto
[39:22] Joshua this day will I begin to magnify
[39:26] thee in the sight of all Israel that
[39:28] they may know that as I was with Moses
[39:31] so I will be with thee Thou shalt
[39:34] command the priests that bear the Ark of
[39:36] the Covenant saying when ye are come to
[39:39] the brink of the water of Jordan ye
[39:41] shall stand still in Jordan and now
[39:45] Joshua instructs the congregation
[39:47] skipping to verse 13 he's telling them
[39:50] it shall come to pass as soon as the
[39:52] souls of the feet of the priests that
[39:53] bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all
[39:56] the the Earth shall rest in the waters
[39:58] of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan
[40:00] shall be cut off from the waters that
[40:02] come down from above and they shall
[40:04] stand upon a heap verse 17 the priests
[40:08] that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the
[40:09] Lord stood firm on dry ground in the
[40:13] midst of
[40:15] Jordan and all the
[40:18] Israelites were passed clean over
[40:22] Jordan now in Exodus after crossing the
[40:25] Red Sea they sang and danc the song of
[40:28] Moses was so inspired that in the Book
[40:30] of Revelation we read that they sing
[40:34] it but this
[40:36] time the time of crossing the Jordan the
[40:39] flood the spring of the
[40:41] year they don't sing and dance they
[40:43] build a memorial each tribe provides a
[40:46] male representative and in Joshua 4:4 we
[40:49] read then Joshua called the 12 men whom
[40:51] he had prepared of the children of
[40:53] Israel out of every tribe a man Joshua
[40:57] said unto
[40:58] them pass over before the Ark of the
[41:01] Lord your God into the midst of Jordan
[41:04] and take you up every man of you a stone
[41:06] upon his shoulder according to the
[41:08] number of the tribes of the children of
[41:11] Israel this may be a sign among you when
[41:14] your children asked their fathers in
[41:16] time to come in the future
[41:19] saying what's with these rocks what do
[41:22] you mean by these Stones you shall
[41:24] answer them the Waters of the Jordan
[41:27] were cut off before the Ark of the
[41:29] Covenant of the Lord when it passed over
[41:32] Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut
[41:36] off notice you may not recognize this
[41:39] but this is a form of Hebrew poetry when
[41:41] something is said and then it's same
[41:42] thing is said again slightly differently
[41:45] you'll find these kind of couplets in in
[41:47] many places and it's as I say it's a
[41:49] form of Hebrew poetry and it's wonderful
[41:52] in a way because it doesn't depend upon
[41:54] rhyming in pentameter and that
[41:57] so when you translate it into other
[41:59] languages it still retains that same
[42:02] format that same
[42:04] Beauty and these Stones shall be for a
[42:06] memorial unto the children of Israel
[42:09] forever now brother Daniel I think when
[42:11] Joshua was looking for guys he didn't
[42:13] say let's find
[42:15] a 73 year old guy to carry this Boulder
[42:18] I think he I think they got Daniel Jr
[42:21] and and other folks like him because
[42:23] this wasn't to be Pebbles this wasn't to
[42:25] be stones
[42:26] these were to be Boulders these were to
[42:28] be a burden they were to show the the
[42:32] the work and the turmoil and the travail
[42:34] they were a testimony they were a
[42:36] testimony just like two and a half weeks
[42:38] ago we had a testimony service here many
[42:40] of those testimonies were of many of you
[42:43] that have come through some pretty rough
[42:45] places carrying those Boulders on your
[42:48] shoulder to stack them up as a testimony
[42:51] as a witness and that's exactly what
[42:54] they did here
[42:58] the children of Israel did as Joshua
[43:00] commanded took up 12 Stones Out of the
[43:01] midst of Jordan as the Lord spoke unto
[43:03] Joshua according to the number of the
[43:06] tribes of the children of Israel and
[43:08] carried them over with them into the
[43:10] place where they lodged and they laid
[43:11] them down there Joshua didn't stop there
[43:15] Joshua set up what another 12 Stones in
[43:20] the midst of Jordan in the place where
[43:23] the feet of the priests which bear the
[43:25] Ark of the C
[43:26] stood and at the time the book was
[43:29] written the author says and they are
[43:31] there unto This
[43:33] Day verse 14 on that day the Lord
[43:38] magnified Joshua in the sight of all
[43:40] Israel and they feared that word there
[43:42] means revered were in awe of him as they
[43:46] feared Moses all the days of his life he
[43:51] didn't give them a reason to
[43:55] not unlike with Moses who stretched out
[43:58] his staff over the Red Sea the Jordan
[44:00] opened when the feet of the priests
[44:02] carrying the ark touched the water the
[44:04] waters returned when the priest's feet
[44:06] came to the normal Shoreline of the
[44:08] river and we
[44:10] read and the people came up out of
[44:13] Jordan on the 10th day of the first
[44:15] month and encamped in gilgal and the
[44:19] east border of Jericho so they're
[44:22] between Jericho and the river that's a
[44:24] distance of about six miles between the
[44:26] walls of Jericho and the Jordan
[44:28] River and these 12 Stones which they
[44:31] took out of Jordan did Joshua pitch did
[44:35] he place in
[44:39] gilgal so we now come to chapter five
[44:44] you recall when we studied the book of
[44:45] Acts I mentioned that the people falsely
[44:48] accusing Paul of teaching against
[44:50] circumcision of Jewish Believers being a
[44:52] violation of the law of Moses that they
[44:55] could have picked a better example and
[44:57] here's why Joshua 5:2 at that time the
[45:01] Lord said unto Joshua make the sharp
[45:03] knives and circumcise again the children
[45:06] of Israel the second time that is
[45:08] circumcise this second generation this
[45:11] new generation and this is the cause
[45:13] this is the reason why Joshua did
[45:15] circumcise all the people that came out
[45:17] of Egypt that were males even all the
[45:19] men of War died in the wilderness by the
[45:21] way after they came out of Egypt now all
[45:24] the people that came out were
[45:25] circumcised but all the people that were
[45:28] born in the wilderness by the way as
[45:30] they came forth out of Egypt them they
[45:34] had not
[45:36] circumcised and their children whom he
[45:38] raised up in their stead them Joshua
[45:41] circumcised for they were uncircumcised
[45:43] because they had not circumcised them by
[45:45] the way 40 years under Moses 40 years
[45:50] Moses was disobeying the law of Moses if
[45:53] we want to take how the people in Acts
[45:55] were talking about
[45:57] it with all the Revelation that came
[46:01] they didn't practice this fundamental
[46:04] institution I I find that
[46:06] amazing the Lord said unto Joshua look
[46:09] how important this was to the Lord this
[46:12] day have I rolled away the reproach the
[46:15] shame the stigma of Egypt from off you
[46:20] this right was that important to the
[46:23] Lord as he told Abraham the same thing
[46:25] when he instituted it wherefore because
[46:28] of this the name of the place is called
[46:31] gilgal unto this day gilgal is derived
[46:34] from the word that means wheel and it
[46:36] means
[46:37] rolling this day I have rolled away the
[46:40] reproach and the reminder of that is the
[46:42] name of the
[46:44] camp remember in chapter 4 we read it
[46:47] was the 10th day of the first month when
[46:49] they crossed the Jordan now on the 14th
[46:51] day they observe the Passover in the
[46:53] land the next day the Mana stops we're
[46:57] told in verse 13 and came to pass when
[47:01] Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up
[47:04] his eyes and looked and behold there
[47:07] stood a man over against that means
[47:09] opposite near in in in front of him with
[47:13] his sword drawn in his
[47:14] hand and Joshua went unto him and
[47:17] demanded of him are you for us or for
[47:20] our
[47:22] adversaries and he said nay but as a
[47:25] captain
[47:26] of the host of the Lord am I now
[47:30] come and Joshua fell on his face to the
[47:33] Earth and did worship and said unto him
[47:36] what saith my Lord unto his servant and
[47:38] the captain of the Lord's host said unto
[47:42] Joshua loose off thy shoe from off thy
[47:45] foot the place whereon thou standest is
[47:50] Holy and Joshua did so brother bradam
[47:53] tells us that Joshua met Jesus that
[47:57] in chapter six we
[48:00] read now Josh now Jericho was straightly
[48:03] shut up because of the children of
[48:05] Israel none went out none came in the
[48:09] Lord said unto Joshua see I have given
[48:11] unto thine hand Jericho and the King
[48:13] thereof and all the Mighty Men of Valor
[48:15] and you shall compass that means
[48:18] encircle the city all ye Men of War and
[48:21] go round about the city once thus shalt
[48:24] thou do six days days and seven priests
[48:28] shall bear before the ark seven trumpets
[48:30] of rams horns and the seventh day you
[48:33] shall Compass the city seven times and
[48:36] the P priests shall blow with the
[48:38] trumpets and it shall come to
[48:40] pass that when they make a long blast
[48:43] with the Rams Horn and when you hear the
[48:45] sound of the trumpet all the people
[48:47] shall Shout with a great shout exactly
[48:50] what the song said this evening and the
[48:52] wall of the city shall fall down flat
[48:55] and the people shall send up every man
[48:58] straight before
[49:00] him well they did that in verse 20 we
[49:03] read so the people shouted when the
[49:05] priests blew with the trumpets and it
[49:08] came to pass when the people heard the
[49:09] sound of the trumpet and the people
[49:11] heard people shouted with a great
[49:14] shout that the wall fell down flat so
[49:18] that the people went up into the city
[49:20] every man straight before him and they
[49:22] took the
[49:24] city
[49:26] now those of you sitting in the back you
[49:30] might want to bring your
[49:32] binoculars a little late tonight so
[49:35] squint or move
[49:37] forward this is a drawing from the
[49:40] excavation that was done Jericho back
[49:43] around 1950 and uh you can see this is
[49:46] what what it looked like at the time
[49:48] just a lot of dirt but when they got rid
[49:50] of that dirt that was on the level they
[49:52] found that there was a fallen wall it
[49:55] wasn't knocked down from the outside
[49:57] pushed in it fell down it fell out and
[50:00] there was a second wall around Jericho
[50:03] and it also fell down
[50:06] flat
[50:08] huh interesting the Bible says you dig
[50:13] in the right place and you find it it's
[50:16] there it's
[50:18] there I recently acquired a book Exodus
[50:21] route restored I was going to bring it
[50:23] out here but it's big and heavy and I I
[50:25] would have had to put it on my shoulder
[50:27] it provides an in-depth examination of
[50:29] the archaeology of The Exodus under
[50:31] Moses and the subsequent Conquest under
[50:33] Joshua now there's no archaeology that
[50:36] can say yeah trumpets were blown or
[50:39] people shouted but the archaeology can
[50:41] show that the walls fell down
[50:45] outward let's read on Joshua had said
[50:49] unto the two men that had spied out the
[50:51] country go into the harlot's house and
[50:53] bring out then the woman and all that
[50:56] she hath as she SAR unto her and the
[50:59] young men that were spies went in and
[51:01] brought out Rahab and her father and her
[51:04] mother and her Brethren and all that she
[51:08] had unlike all those people in Noah's
[51:11] day more people listen to
[51:14] Rahab and they brought out all her
[51:16] Kindred and left them without outside
[51:19] the camp of Israel and they burnt the
[51:21] city with fire and all that was
[51:24] therein well I know that these are a
[51:26] little bit hard to see
[51:28] but the guy on that side at the far end
[51:32] of the screen with a red shirt he's
[51:34] showing that here's these pots big big
[51:38] ceramic pots and what's in them seeds
[51:42] that had been burned burnt seeds there's
[51:45] evidence of the
[51:46] fire but the amazing thing here is that
[51:51] this shows that Jericho didn't give in
[51:54] after a lengthy Seas the people starving
[51:56] to death and all the rest of the things
[51:58] that happened in Warfare in those days
[52:00] they had plenty of food they had plenty
[52:03] of food no it the walls fell down when
[52:07] they blew the trumpet and when they
[52:08] shouted there was food there was
[52:10] everything they needed in the city it
[52:12] wasn't a Siege it was an instantaneous
[52:15] Victory and the archaeology demonstrates
[52:18] that 3,400 years later it's there as a
[52:24] witness and Joshua saved Rahab the
[52:27] Harlot alive and her father's household
[52:29] and all that she had and she dwelleth in
[52:31] Israel even unto this day because she
[52:35] hid The Messengers which Joshua was sent
[52:37] to spy out Jericho Paul refers to this
[52:39] also in Hebrews 11:31 by faith the
[52:43] Harlot Rahab perished not with them that
[52:45] believe not when she had received the
[52:48] slies with
[52:49] peace and not only that we read in the
[52:53] list of the ancestors of of Jesus
[52:55] adoptive parents and Matthew as the
[52:58] children did so wonderfully this last
[53:00] Sunday morning I'll do it in the NIV to
[53:02] make it a little clearer talking about
[53:05] this lineage it says salmon was the
[53:07] father of Boaz whose mother was Rahab
[53:11] yeah this Rahab the Harlot a
[53:15] Canaanite a woman of Jericho Boaz was a
[53:19] father of OED whose mother was Ruth of
[53:23] Moab two of the only three women that
[53:26] are mentioned in the genealogies of
[53:28] Jesus adoptive parents and the only two
[53:30] that are mentioned by name the third one
[53:33] not mentioned by name was basba OED the
[53:36] father of
[53:37] Jesse Jericho wasn't just an important
[53:40] gateway to the land it contained an
[53:43] extremely important person a woman at
[53:46] whom we might look a scance but whom God
[53:49] looked upon with great
[53:52] favor we must be very
[53:55] very careful how we see and treat not
[53:59] only each other but
[54:03] everyone we find in chapter 7 that when
[54:05] the city of AI was attacked the army of
[54:07] Israel suffered losses and retreated
[54:10] they they discovered that a young
[54:11] soldier named achen had taken some
[54:13] things from the city of Jericho that he
[54:15] had been told not to
[54:17] touch his punishment was severe I think
[54:20] we all know that he and his family and
[54:22] everything he had were
[54:24] destroyed and the Disobedience was
[54:26] eradicated so it's important not just to
[54:29] seek the will of the Lord but once
[54:33] having it shown to us to follow in it
[54:37] Aon knew the will of the Lord was for
[54:39] him to not take that he
[54:42] disobeyed once this was dealt with
[54:44] Joshua led the forces of Israel to
[54:46] victory over AI as recorded in chapter 8
[54:50] after the victory we
[54:52] read then Joshua built an altar unto the
[54:55] Lord God of Israel and mount Abal as
[54:58] Moses the servant of the Lord commanded
[55:00] the children of Israel as it is written
[55:02] in the book of the law of Moses an altar
[55:04] of whole Stones over which no man have
[55:06] lifted up any iron that's Exodus 20:24
[55:09] which you remember because we studied
[55:11] Exodus and they offered thereon burnt
[55:13] offerings unto the Lord and sacrificed
[55:16] peace offerings the background in this
[55:19] slide is the archaeological site of an
[55:21] altar on Mount Abal believed to include
[55:24] that of Joshua it's been excavated in
[55:27] the last archaeologists have been there
[55:30] Excavating and sifting through things
[55:32] and they found some pretty amazing
[55:34] things starting about 2016 I think it's
[55:37] all very recent stuff the more the
[55:39] skepticism arises the more the Lord
[55:41] raises up a standard through science
[55:43] through faith through every Dimension
[55:45] that you can think of of human activity
[55:47] his witness is there it's consistent and
[55:49] it's
[55:51] true and he Joshua wrote thereon upon
[55:55] the stones a copy of the law of Moses
[55:57] which he wrote in the presence of the
[55:58] children of
[56:00] Israel Deuteronomy
[56:03] 27 we also discover in Deuteronomy that
[56:06] this altar Moses said when you build
[56:08] this altar in this place covered in
[56:12] plaster well makes it possible to write
[56:16] if it's covered in plaster otherwise
[56:17] it's just rocks that you've picked up it
[56:21] all fits together and all Israel and
[56:24] their elders and officers and their
[56:26] judges stood on this side of the Ark and
[56:29] on that side before the priests the
[56:31] Levites which be the Arc of the Covenant
[56:33] of the Lord as well as a stranger as he
[56:35] that was born among them half of them
[56:37] over Mount against Mount girisim half of
[56:40] them over against Mount ebal as Moses
[56:43] the servant of the Lord had commanded
[56:44] before that they should Bless the people
[56:46] of Israel that's Deuteronomy 11 and
[56:48] Deuteronomy 27 and afterward he Joshua
[56:53] read all the words of the law the
[56:55] blessings and cursings according to all
[56:57] that is written in the book of the law
[57:01] one of the things that they found in
[57:03] this site at Mount eel is some lead uh
[57:07] tablets that are kind of folded up but
[57:09] they contain
[57:10] cursings of the god of
[57:14] Israel in chapter nine the leaders of
[57:17] the cities of gibian jeffa Barth and kth
[57:21] yum pretended to be from an unnamed far
[57:25] country they're good actors maybe they
[57:27] were from the Hollywood of their day I'm
[57:29] not sure and Joshua and the princes of
[57:31] the congregation made an agreement with
[57:33] them to not kill
[57:35] them they then find out that these
[57:38] Travelers are in fact from the local
[57:40] area that God through Moses and
[57:42] Deuteronomy told them to
[57:44] annihilate they became bond bondmen in
[57:47] modern terms slaves to Israel then in
[57:50] chapter 10 now it came to pass when Adon
[57:55] zc adoni is is means Lord basically and
[57:58] zedek is is righteous or holy so this
[58:01] guy's title is is I'm I'm a righteous
[58:04] Lord king of Jerusalem had heard how
[58:06] Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly
[58:09] destroyed it as he had done to Jericho
[58:11] and her King so he had done to Ai and
[58:13] her King and how the inhabitants of
[58:16] gibian had made peace with Israel and
[58:18] were among them that they feared greatly
[58:22] because gibian was a great city is one
[58:24] of the Royal cities because it was
[58:26] greater than Ai and all the men thereof
[58:28] were Mighty and now they're in League
[58:30] with Israel wherefore ad onedc king of
[58:35] Jerusalem son unto ham it's not ham it's
[58:38] ham king of heon and unto Pam king of
[58:42] yut and unto yafia king of leish and
[58:44] unto deil king of Egon and and Kings
[58:47] here are more like city managers or or
[58:50] Mayors today is like he sent to the to
[58:52] the king of Oro Valley and the king of
[58:54] South south Tucson and the king of
[58:56] Sarita okay so these are cities they're
[58:58] not countries as we think of countries
[59:00] and kings and he said to them come up
[59:03] unto me and help me that we may Smite
[59:07] gibian for it hath made peace with
[59:10] Joshua and with the children of
[59:14] Israel I'm glad you brought your
[59:17] binoculars so we see here this red line
[59:21] in this map that's towards the outside
[59:24] wall there
[59:25] that's the route that Joshua takes from
[59:27] gilgal up to gibian which is circled in
[59:30] red and he surprises the Army assembled
[59:33] against
[59:34] gibian we read about two Miracles
[59:36] associated with with these battles one
[59:40] is that the Lord gives him a great
[59:42] Victory with more of the Enemy being
[59:44] destroyed by giant
[59:46] hailstones a massive desert hail storm
[59:50] we live in the desert how often do we
[59:53] have hail that's big enough to hit you
[59:55] and kill you it's a miracle it's
[59:58] unusual more were killed by giant
[1:00:01] hailstones than by the Army led by
[1:00:02] Joshua the city circled in yellow are
[1:00:04] the cities where the five kings were
[1:00:06] that came to destroy gibian again gibian
[1:00:09] circled in
[1:00:11] red if you can't see that map very well
[1:00:13] we got lots of seats in the front Okay I
[1:00:15] placed a rectangle on the other map
[1:00:18] which is modern borders and modern
[1:00:20] territories to show you uh where this
[1:00:23] other one is zoomed in in front to give
[1:00:25] you an idea where this particular
[1:00:27] campaign was
[1:00:28] fought in blue I circled I
[1:00:32] alone this is where the second Miracle
[1:00:34] occurs while they're fighting we read
[1:00:36] that the sun over gibian and the Moon
[1:00:38] Over the Valley of Ione Stood Still for
[1:00:41] about a
[1:00:42] day by the way you may have heard about
[1:00:45] oh there's a computer simulation they
[1:00:47] did at Nasa at Caltech and it shows that
[1:00:50] there's a day that's missing or almost a
[1:00:52] day and there's 20 minutes that's
[1:00:54] missing
[1:00:55] those reports are not
[1:00:56] true you can look it up you can research
[1:00:59] it you can contact NASA or jet
[1:01:01] propulsion labri Caltech if you want or
[1:01:03] you can take my word for it those
[1:01:05] reports are not true there's controversy
[1:01:08] over what does this actually mean the
[1:01:10] the the Hebrew word Dam has many
[1:01:12] meanings to stop also means to cease to
[1:01:14] forbear to hold peace to quiet self to
[1:01:17] us to be silent uh to stand still to
[1:01:20] chry to wait so we don't know the the
[1:01:23] mechanism by which God performed this
[1:01:24] miracle but we do know that whatever it
[1:01:26] was it was
[1:01:29] miraculous and we read in the New
[1:01:31] Testament of another Supernatural
[1:01:34] occurrence in the valley of
[1:01:37] Iowa did you know what it
[1:01:41] was nobody's raising their hand okay
[1:01:44] I'll tell you then Luke 24 we read
[1:01:47] behold two of them that went that same
[1:01:50] day to a village called Deus which was
[1:01:52] from Jerusalem about three score fur
[1:01:54] belongs it's located in The Descent to
[1:01:56] the valley of
[1:01:57] ion and they talked together of all
[1:02:00] these things which had happened and it
[1:02:01] came to pass that while they commun
[1:02:02] together and reasoned that the
[1:02:04] miraculous happened again in the valley
[1:02:06] of Ione and Jesus himself Drew near and
[1:02:10] went with
[1:02:12] them a personal
[1:02:15] note brother Arie May recognize this
[1:02:19] this is a painting that was done by
[1:02:21] Brother Steve schwitzer about 45 years
[1:02:23] ago of of a mon are the large building
[1:02:26] that you see there that was built about
[1:02:27] a 100 years ago when we lived in Israel
[1:02:30] nearly 50 years ago my oldest brother
[1:02:32] Paul and his family lived there helping
[1:02:35] to repair it to restore it in fact his
[1:02:37] youngest daughter was born in that
[1:02:39] building and her name is Iona because
[1:02:42] she was born in
[1:02:44] IO and and the foreground of this
[1:02:47] painting you can see a little bit of an
[1:02:48] arch and
[1:02:51] whatnot is the ruins of a fourth Century
[1:02:54] Church complete with Mosaic floors and
[1:02:57] believed by some to be the site of the
[1:02:59] building in biblical emus where Jesus
[1:03:02] broke bread brother Arie you may recall
[1:03:05] we had communion in one of the upper
[1:03:07] rooms of that building with brother
[1:03:08] Green in
[1:03:10] 1976 in the ruins there's a
[1:03:13] baptistry indicating that baptism by
[1:03:15] immersion was the practice at that
[1:03:19] time okay back to Joshua chapter 11 we
[1:03:22] read of a northern campaign of Conquest
[1:03:25] West again the same thing a rectangle in
[1:03:27] the modern map showing you what's going
[1:03:29] on in the other
[1:03:31] map uh I'll tell you what's on the map
[1:03:34] um it's it's it's various battles that
[1:03:38] are described in chapter 11 and while
[1:03:41] it's a little bit hard to see and I
[1:03:43] apologize for that because I I got this
[1:03:45] map from uh from a program that made it
[1:03:49] hard to make things Bolder but in any
[1:03:52] event you'll notice that most of the
[1:03:54] fighting most of the things that are
[1:03:56] going on here the red is the path of the
[1:03:59] children of Israel the blue is the path
[1:04:01] of the of the bad guys if you will that
[1:04:04] uh that these battles occur in the Hill
[1:04:07] Country what they're conquering is the
[1:04:09] Hill Country when you get down by the by
[1:04:11] the
[1:04:11] shorelines uh there's not too much
[1:04:13] activity going on there well chapter 12
[1:04:17] lists the kings of the various cities
[1:04:19] and territories defeated under the
[1:04:21] commands of Moses and of Joshua in
[1:04:23] chapter 13 there's a Flash Forward in
[1:04:25] time and we
[1:04:27] learn verse one now Joshua was old and
[1:04:31] stricken in years and the Lord said unto
[1:04:33] him Thou Art old and stricken in years I
[1:04:37] I I love this can you see the humor
[1:04:41] here Joshua I'm going to reveal
[1:04:43] something to you my friend you're old
[1:04:45] and stricken in
[1:04:47] years and and and and you can just say
[1:04:49] you're old you don't have to say you're
[1:04:51] stricken in years right Hebrews a very
[1:04:54] compact language and it's expensive to
[1:04:56] to write things down so to take the time
[1:04:59] to write this and to write it twice I
[1:05:01] just think God has a wonderful sense of
[1:05:02] humor I I read this and I just well I
[1:05:05] did more than
[1:05:07] chuckled Thou Art old and stricken in
[1:05:09] years and there remaineth yet very much
[1:05:12] land to be
[1:05:14] possessed the extensive territories that
[1:05:16] remain are then listed the territory
[1:05:19] east of the Jordan is listed where the
[1:05:21] descendants of Reuben manasse and Gad
[1:05:25] were given under Moses here's a pop quiz
[1:05:28] for you it's the descendants of Reuben
[1:05:31] manasse and Gad what do those three guys
[1:05:34] share in
[1:05:37] common okay they're all firstborns
[1:05:41] they're all firstborn son Ruben is the
[1:05:43] firstborn of Leah Manasseh is the
[1:05:46] firstborn of Joseph who was the
[1:05:48] firstborn of Rachel and Gad is the
[1:05:51] firstborn of Zila who was uh Leia as
[1:05:55] slave okay that was just a pop quiz
[1:06:00] you're not going to be graded it's fine
[1:06:02] but there's a warning sign that gets
[1:06:04] flashed in verse 13 nevertheless the
[1:06:07] children of Israel expelled not the
[1:06:09] gites nor the maites but the gites and
[1:06:12] the maites dwell among the Israelites
[1:06:13] under this day this is in the land east
[1:06:16] of the Jordan This is while they were
[1:06:17] still under the leadership of Moses
[1:06:21] incomplete chapter 14 starts the process
[1:06:24] of dividing the land both conquered and
[1:06:27] still to be conquered among the
[1:06:28] descendants of Jacob and
[1:06:30] Joseph at the start of this there's
[1:06:33] something that we learned but but notice
[1:06:35] that they're dividing the land even
[1:06:37] though they haven't conquered it yet
[1:06:39] it's part of the territory that's
[1:06:42] described I think that speaks to Faith
[1:06:45] but let's there's a little bit of a
[1:06:47] surprise it was a surprise to me in
[1:06:50] Joshua 14 at verse 6 we're going to
[1:06:53] learn a little bit bit of something here
[1:06:54] and the thing we're going to learn I'll
[1:06:56] make it easy for you is that this these
[1:06:58] campaigns these battles after they
[1:07:00] crossed over from Jericho until they
[1:07:02] stopped fighting was about seven years
[1:07:06] that's a long time to be fighting but
[1:07:09] seven years Joshua lived for decades
[1:07:12] after they crossed the Jordan but they
[1:07:14] stopped fighting after seven years the
[1:07:16] children of Judah came unto Joshua in
[1:07:19] gilgal and Caleb the son of jhuna the
[1:07:22] kenite now now some people say well well
[1:07:26] he was a mixed multitude guy or he
[1:07:28] wasn't Jewish or something but but when
[1:07:31] they're picking the 12 Spies earlier
[1:07:34] back in numbers to go into the land and
[1:07:37] and check and and see what's going on
[1:07:40] and the 12 guys come back and Joshua and
[1:07:41] Caleb say we can take the land and the
[1:07:43] other 10 guys persuade people that they
[1:07:45] can't that Caleb is the representative
[1:07:48] of the tribe of Judah he is a major guy
[1:07:51] in the tribe of Judah so he his dad
[1:07:54] would jauna and the the kenite doesn't
[1:07:58] mean that he's from some place called
[1:07:59] Kenny and therefore he's a kenite it
[1:08:02] just it has something to do probably
[1:08:05] with where he was from but probably in
[1:08:07] Egypt because he'd been in Egypt for 4
[1:08:09] something years they hadn't been in
[1:08:11] Canaan
[1:08:13] anyway calb came and said unto him thou
[1:08:16] knowest the thing the Lord said unto
[1:08:19] Moses the man of God concerning me and
[1:08:21] thee and Kadesh barnea 40 years old was
[1:08:25] I when Moses the servant of the Lord
[1:08:27] sent me from KES barnea to spy out the
[1:08:29] land and now behold the Lord has kept me
[1:08:32] alive as he said these 45 years ever
[1:08:36] since the Lord spake this word unto
[1:08:38] Moses while the children of Israel
[1:08:40] wandered in the wilderness and now lo I
[1:08:43] am this day four score and five years
[1:08:46] old excuse
[1:08:48] me so he's age 85 it's 45 years after
[1:08:52] being a spy they want wandered for about
[1:08:54] 38 years after that uh uh rejection of
[1:08:58] going into the land at that time so that
[1:09:01] leaves about seven years for the
[1:09:03] conquest of Canaan now some people do
[1:09:04] the math and say well it's six years
[1:09:06] because it was this month and that month
[1:09:08] and other people say well no it was
[1:09:09] really eight years seven years plus or
[1:09:12] minus now therefore give me this
[1:09:14] mountain where of the Lord spake in that
[1:09:18] day and Joshua blessed him and gave unto
[1:09:21] Caleb the son of jauna heon
[1:09:24] fore an inheritance Hein therefore
[1:09:27] became the inheritance of Caleb the son
[1:09:29] of jauna the kenite unto this day
[1:09:31] because that he wholly followed the Lord
[1:09:34] God of Israel the name of hrin before
[1:09:36] was cirat arba which means settlement or
[1:09:39] Community number four and the land had
[1:09:42] rest from war so at age 885 of Caleb
[1:09:47] they stopped the
[1:09:51] fight so this map shows in Salmon I
[1:09:57] guess that's the right color to describe
[1:09:59] that as being uh the territory the
[1:10:02] approximate borders the region of the
[1:10:04] territory that they that they conquered
[1:10:06] but their territory that their promise
[1:10:08] goes all the way to the Sea so a lot of
[1:10:10] that white area between the
[1:10:12] Mediterranean and that salmon colored
[1:10:15] area is land that is supposed to be
[1:10:17] theirs but they didn't
[1:10:20] take so under Joshua the hill country
[1:10:23] was bacon some of the Southern desert
[1:10:25] and the Jordan Valley but the campaign
[1:10:27] ended with large portions of the divided
[1:10:29] territory still in the control of the
[1:10:31] Canaanite
[1:10:32] population why is
[1:10:35] that I'll give you a lead in when we
[1:10:37] when we get to the first part of the
[1:10:38] Book of Judges you may hear about that
[1:10:40] that why that was which would be next
[1:10:43] Wednesday
[1:10:44] approximately or we may not hear so you
[1:10:46] might want to go ahead and read chapter
[1:10:49] 15-8 continue describing the borders
[1:10:52] within the division of the land land and
[1:10:54] in chapter 18 we read the whole
[1:10:58] Congregation of the children of Israel
[1:11:01] assembled together at Shiloh and set up
[1:11:04] the Tabernacle of the congregation there
[1:11:07] and the land was subdued before them the
[1:11:10] background of this slide is the
[1:11:13] archaeological dig now occurring in
[1:11:16] Shiloh this is where the Tabernacle was
[1:11:19] pitched this is where the ark
[1:11:21] resided when we get to
[1:11:24] the book of Samuel Samuel served under
[1:11:27] the priest there at the Tabernacle at
[1:11:30] Shiloh this is that very spot the ark
[1:11:34] was moved to Shiloh about 1399 BC it
[1:11:38] remained there acting as a de facto
[1:11:40] capital of Israel certainly its
[1:11:42] spiritual center for over 300 years
[1:11:44] until the Philistines capture it around
[1:11:46] 1094 BC Shiloh is located about 20 miles
[1:11:50] north of
[1:11:52] Jerusalem
[1:11:56] chapter 19 concludes the land division
[1:11:58] among the tribes and 19
[1:12:01] ends these are the inheritances which
[1:12:04] elaser the priest and Joshua the son of
[1:12:07] nun and the heads of the fathers of the
[1:12:09] tribes of the children of Israel divided
[1:12:12] for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh
[1:12:15] before the Lord at the door of the
[1:12:17] Tabernacle of the congregation so they
[1:12:20] made an end of dividing the
[1:12:22] country so when we see in uh acts: 126
[1:12:26] where the disciples cast lots to to
[1:12:28] choose a replacement for judas's carriot
[1:12:31] they were following a long established
[1:12:37] practice so here what I've done is I've
[1:12:40] taken a a modern map on the one side and
[1:12:44] in the middle the approximate division
[1:12:47] of the territories among the tribes and
[1:12:48] you'll see that different Maps will show
[1:12:51] things a little bit different but it
[1:12:53] gives you the general idea and even if
[1:12:55] you had binoculars you probably couldn't
[1:12:56] read the labels of all that but that's
[1:12:59] not what's so terribly important what I
[1:13:01] wanted to also put in there the black
[1:13:02] lines that I put in show you the borders
[1:13:05] of modern Israel and the red lines show
[1:13:08] you the Palestinian territories the West
[1:13:10] Bank and Gaza just to give you an idea
[1:13:13] of the things you see in the news today
[1:13:15] and what's going on and how that fits
[1:13:17] into the into the Book of Joshua how it
[1:13:21] fits into things today you know it's
[1:13:24] it's interesting that we read about
[1:13:25] something that's 3,400 years ago and
[1:13:28] then we turn on the news today and you
[1:13:30] see exactly the same places and exactly
[1:13:34] the same struggles and
[1:13:36] exactly the more
[1:13:39] things go on the more they seem to not
[1:13:42] really change that
[1:13:43] much anyway I just wanted to give you
[1:13:46] that I that idea of context and and
[1:13:49] again this shows the territories of uh
[1:13:53] divided on the one side versus the
[1:13:56] territory they actually conquered on the
[1:13:57] other side so you can see that uh way
[1:14:01] over here the purple going up on that
[1:14:04] edge is ashers territory he uh he's
[1:14:08] going to have a hard time living there
[1:14:09] because they they didn't conquer that
[1:14:11] and a big chunk of what's called West
[1:14:13] manasse uh a large chunk of Dan big
[1:14:17] piece of Judah they uh they've got some
[1:14:20] work ahead of
[1:14:22] them
[1:14:25] so I think there's another lesson in
[1:14:28] there that that we can take and that is
[1:14:31] to be strong to be
[1:14:34] encouraged and to press on Don't Stop
[1:14:38] Don't
[1:14:39] Stop chapter 20 identifies six Cities of
[1:14:44] Refuge this is for protection of one
[1:14:47] accused of murder but more likely guilty
[1:14:49] of what we would think of as
[1:14:51] manslaughter it becomes a safe place to
[1:14:54] act as a temporary place to stay until
[1:14:55] he or she may stand trial this is a
[1:14:58] major advancement in criminal justice
[1:15:00] distinguishing between causes of death
[1:15:04] as opposed to the social status of the
[1:15:06] accused and the
[1:15:08] deceased Joshua 20 the Lord also spake
[1:15:12] unto Joshua saying speak to the children
[1:15:14] of Israel saying appoint out for you
[1:15:16] Cities of Refuge whereof I spake unto
[1:15:19] you by the hand of Moses that the Slayer
[1:15:21] that kth any person unaware bears and
[1:15:23] unwittingly May flee thither and they
[1:15:26] shall be your Refuge from the Avenger of
[1:15:29] blood and when he that doth flee unto
[1:15:32] one of these cities shall stand at the
[1:15:34] entering in of the Gate of the city and
[1:15:36] shall declare his cause in the ears of
[1:15:38] the Elders of that City they shall take
[1:15:41] him into the city unto them and give him
[1:15:43] a place that he may dwell among them and
[1:15:46] if the Avenger of blood pursue after him
[1:15:48] then they shall not deliver the Slayer
[1:15:50] up into his hand because he smote his
[1:15:52] neighbor unwittingly and hated him not
[1:15:56] Before Time hate
[1:16:00] crimes that's something that we hear
[1:16:02] about a lot
[1:16:06] today and he shall dwell in that city
[1:16:09] until he stand before the congregation
[1:16:10] for judgment and until the death of the
[1:16:12] high priest that shall be in those days
[1:16:14] then shall the Slayer return and come
[1:16:16] into his own City and unto his own house
[1:16:19] unto the city from whence he
[1:16:22] fled
[1:16:25] excuse me
[1:16:26] please so this map I've circled in red
[1:16:29] the Cities of
[1:16:31] Refuge I realize you probably can't read
[1:16:33] them but you can see that they're
[1:16:34] scattered throughout the territory three
[1:16:36] on the east side of Jordan three on the
[1:16:38] west side of Jordan the one in the
[1:16:39] middle on the west side is a city of
[1:16:42] sheam which plays a big role in in in
[1:16:45] many things here in uh this portion of
[1:16:47] the Old
[1:16:49] Testament uh now they're not close
[1:16:52] together if you happen to be unlucky
[1:16:53] enough to have accidentally killed your
[1:16:55] neighbor and you're halfway between
[1:16:57] those places you're going to have to
[1:16:59] almost run a marathon you've got you got
[1:17:02] to cover 20 miles before the people that
[1:17:04] are mad at you can catch up to
[1:17:07] you okay that was supposed to be a
[1:17:09] little bit of humor sorry in chapter 21
[1:17:12] a total of 48 cities and their
[1:17:14] surrounding pasture lands are divided
[1:17:16] out amongst the priest and Levites from
[1:17:18] the various Clans territories that's
[1:17:20] what we were talking about the other day
[1:17:23] about uh um in uh in in in Samuel where
[1:17:28] Hannah yeah Dad yeah yeah okay that's
[1:17:32] something private revealed publicly so
[1:17:35] when we get to the fir the book of 1
[1:17:38] Samuel uh you've got a clue that that
[1:17:40] there's something interesting coming up
[1:17:44] okay um in chapter 22 we see that people
[1:17:48] are often
[1:17:49] prone to think the worst
[1:17:53] about others it's a warning to us to be
[1:17:57] careful how we View and especially how
[1:18:00] we interpret the actions of others
[1:18:04] Joshua 22 verse one then Joshua called
[1:18:07] the reubenites and the gadites and the
[1:18:09] halft tribe of Manasseh and said unto
[1:18:11] them you have kept all that Moses the
[1:18:13] servant of the Lord commanded you and
[1:18:15] have obeyed my voice and all that I
[1:18:17] commanded you You' have not left your
[1:18:19] brethren these many days unto this day
[1:18:23] but have kept the charge of the
[1:18:24] Commandment of the Lord your God and now
[1:18:27] the Lord your God hath given rest unto
[1:18:29] your brethren as he promise them
[1:18:32] therefore now return ye and get you into
[1:18:34] your tents and unto the land of your
[1:18:36] possession which Moses the servant of
[1:18:38] the lord gave you on the other side
[1:18:41] Jordan but take diligent heed to do the
[1:18:44] commandment and the law which Moses the
[1:18:46] servant of the Lord charged you to love
[1:18:48] the Lord your God and to walk in all his
[1:18:51] ways and to keep his Commandments and to
[1:18:53] cleave unto him and to serve him with
[1:18:55] all your heart and with all your soul
[1:18:58] it's good advice to all of us so Joshua
[1:19:02] blessed them and sent them away and they
[1:19:04] went into their
[1:19:05] tents so far so good as they turn into
[1:19:10] their inheritance we get to verse
[1:19:12] 10 when they came unto the borders of
[1:19:15] Jordan that are in the land of Canaan
[1:19:18] the children of Reuben and Gad and Hal
[1:19:20] tribe manaza built there an altar by
[1:19:23] Jordan a great altar to see
[1:19:25] too and the children of Israel heard say
[1:19:29] behold the children of Reuben the
[1:19:31] children of G and the half tribe of
[1:19:33] Manasseh have built an over an altar
[1:19:36] over against the land of Canaan in the
[1:19:37] borders of Jordan at the passage of the
[1:19:40] children of
[1:19:41] Israel uhoh when the children of Israel
[1:19:44] heard of it the whole Congregation of
[1:19:47] the children of Israel gathered
[1:19:50] themselves together at
[1:19:51] Shiloh to to go up to war against
[1:19:56] them go to war these guys had just been
[1:20:00] their brothers and arm standing shoulder
[1:20:02] toosh shoulder and putting their lives
[1:20:03] on the line for seven long and dangerous
[1:20:05] years but the instant they hear of
[1:20:08] others even close Associates doing
[1:20:11] something that's not according to their
[1:20:13] interpretation of way they thought the
[1:20:15] prophet had said their Revelation they
[1:20:18] want to excommunicate them in this case
[1:20:21] to go to war to kill
[1:20:24] them fortunately they're willing to
[1:20:28] communicate before they knock their
[1:20:30] arrows and their bows the leaders of the
[1:20:33] various PL Clans came first to those
[1:20:35] whose lands were east of the Jordan and
[1:20:37] said in verse 16 thus saith the whole
[1:20:40] Congregation of the Lord what trespass
[1:20:44] is this that you have committed against
[1:20:45] the god of Israel to turn away this day
[1:20:48] from following the Lord and that ye have
[1:20:51] build it an altar that you might Rebel
[1:20:54] this day against the Lord we've got our
[1:20:57] altar in Shiloh what do you do in
[1:20:59] building an altar down
[1:21:00] here
[1:21:02] remember an altar is made of uncut
[1:21:05] Stones so this is an effect carefully
[1:21:08] arranged pile of
[1:21:10] rocks it's not unlike the 12 Stones
[1:21:13] stacked in nearby gilgal or the Joshua
[1:21:16] placed in the midst of the Jordan River
[1:21:18] as memorials or reminders When Future
[1:21:20] Generations would ask what this group of
[1:21:22] rocks
[1:21:24] means and the ones moving back across
[1:21:26] Jordan declared in verse
[1:21:28] 26 guys you got it wrong therefore we
[1:21:31] said let us now prepare to build us an
[1:21:34] altar not for burnt offering nor for
[1:21:37] sacrifice but it may be a witness a
[1:21:40] testimony between us and you and our
[1:21:43] Generations after us that we might do
[1:21:45] the service of the Lord before him with
[1:21:47] our burnt offerings and with our
[1:21:49] sacrifices and with our peace offerings
[1:21:51] that your children may not say to our
[1:21:53] children in time come you have no part
[1:21:56] in the Lord you live over on that side
[1:21:58] of the river we live on the better side
[1:22:00] of the river you're on the wrong side of
[1:22:02] the tracks you can't be part of us
[1:22:04] therefore said we that it shall be when
[1:22:08] they should say to us or to Our
[1:22:10] Generations and times to come that we
[1:22:13] may say again behold the pattern of the
[1:22:16] altar of the Lord which our fathers made
[1:22:19] not for burnt offerings nor for
[1:22:21] sacrifices but it's a witness between us
[1:22:24] and you not against us between
[1:22:27] us God forbid that we should rebel
[1:22:30] against the Lord and turn this day from
[1:22:32] following the Lord to build an altar for
[1:22:33] burnt offerings meat offerings or
[1:22:35] sacrifices beside the altar of the Lord
[1:22:38] Our God that is before his Tabernacle in
[1:22:42] Shiloh and when pinkas the priest and
[1:22:45] the princes of the congregation and
[1:22:47] heads of the thousands of Israel which
[1:22:49] were with him heard the words that the
[1:22:52] children of Ruin and the children of G
[1:22:54] and the children of Manassa spoke it
[1:22:56] pleased them go Gosh guys we
[1:23:01] misunderstood their motive we
[1:23:03] misunderstood and fellowship is
[1:23:06] restored we must not be quick to judge
[1:23:09] others or impute the intent behind their
[1:23:13] actions we should
[1:23:15] always we should always seek
[1:23:19] understanding often we react based on
[1:23:22] limit and perhaps inaccurate
[1:23:25] information
[1:23:26] guilty we need to respond with love not
[1:23:30] accusation we need to be circumspect not
[1:23:33] jump to conclusions we need to go to the
[1:23:36] source not second or third hand

[1:23:45] moving on to chapter 23 the second to
[1:23:49] last chapter Joshua addresses the
[1:23:51] leaders of isra Israel towards the end
[1:23:53] of his
[1:23:55] life and it came to pass a long time
[1:23:59] after that the Lord had given rest unto
[1:24:01] Israel from their enemies round about so
[1:24:03] this is years later that Joshua waxed
[1:24:07] old and stricken in age Joshua called
[1:24:10] for all Israel for their Elders their
[1:24:12] heads their judges their officers and
[1:24:14] said unto them I am old and stricken an
[1:24:19] age and you have seen all the Lord your
[1:24:22] God hath done unto thee all these
[1:24:23] nations because of you for the Lord your
[1:24:26] God is he that hath fought for you he
[1:24:29] goes on to rehearse many many of the
[1:24:32] things that they have witnessed and
[1:24:35] experienced verse 11 take good heed
[1:24:38] therefore unto yourselves that you love
[1:24:41] the Lord your God else if you do in any
[1:24:44] wise go back and cleave unto the remnant
[1:24:46] of these nations even these that remain
[1:24:49] among you and shall make marriages with
[1:24:51] them and go in unto them and they unto
[1:24:54] you know for a
[1:24:56] certainty there is no doubt the Lord
[1:25:00] your God will no more drive out any of
[1:25:02] these nations from before you but they
[1:25:04] shall be snares and traps unto you
[1:25:08] scores in your sides thorns in your eyes
[1:25:13] until ye perish from off this good land
[1:25:17] which the Lord your God hath given
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:23] we conclude in chapter 24 with something
[1:25:27] that may surprise
[1:25:30] you pardon
[1:25:34] me Joshua gathered all the tribes of
[1:25:37] Israel to
[1:25:41] sheim I love sheim to sheam and called
[1:25:45] for the Elders of Israel and for their
[1:25:47] heads and for their judges and for their
[1:25:49] officers and they presented themselves
[1:25:50] before God and Joshua said unto all the
[1:25:53] people thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[1:25:56] your fathers dwelt this is what our
[1:25:59] brother Daniel read this morning in in
[1:26:01] his message to us all but did you
[1:26:05] notice Joshua the leader the general is
[1:26:10] speaking as a
[1:26:11] prophet thus saith the Lord God of
[1:26:15] Israel it's only two times in the Book
[1:26:17] of Joshua that he says thus sayeth the
[1:26:20] Lord this is one of them the other
[1:26:22] there's in in uh chapter uh seven I
[1:26:25] think it was after the sin of
[1:26:27] achen so a number of things are
[1:26:30] rehearsed and then in verse 13 we
[1:26:34] read this is again Joshua saying thus
[1:26:37] sayeth the Lord and I have given you and
[1:26:40] I have given you a land for which you
[1:26:41] did not labor and cities which you built
[1:26:44] not and ye dwell in them of The
[1:26:47] Vineyards and Olive yards which he
[1:26:49] planted not do you eat and I think at
[1:26:53] this point it stops being Joshua
[1:26:55] speaking as a prophet but now responding
[1:26:59] to the
[1:27:00] prophecy now therefore fear the lord and
[1:27:04] serve him in sincerity and in truth it
[1:27:07] takes
[1:27:08] both and put away the gods which your
[1:27:12] father served on the other side of the
[1:27:14] flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[1:27:18] and if
[1:27:19] it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord
[1:27:23] choose you this day whom ye will serve
[1:27:26] whether the gods which your fathers
[1:27:27] serve that were on the other side of the
[1:27:29] flood gods of the amorites in whose land
[1:27:32] you dwell as for me and my house we will
[1:27:38] serve the
[1:27:39] Lord and the people answered and said
[1:27:42] God forbid that we should forsake the
[1:27:44] Lord to serve other
[1:27:47] gods verse 19 Joshua said unto the
[1:27:50] people you cannot serve the Lord
[1:27:52] he's a holy God he's a jealous God he
[1:27:56] will not forgive your transgressions nor
[1:27:59] your sins if he forsake the Lord
[1:28:01] and serve other
[1:28:08] gods okay looks like I blew it again
[1:28:10] brother
[1:28:11] Jordan then he will turn and do you hurt
[1:28:14] and consume you after that Heath done
[1:28:16] you
[1:28:18] good and the people said unto Joshua but
[1:28:22] we will serve the
[1:28:24] Lord and Joshua said unto the people ye
[1:28:27] are witnesses against yourselves that
[1:28:30] you have chosen you the Lord to serve
[1:28:33] him and they said we Are
[1:28:36] Witnesses now therefore put away the
[1:28:40] strange Gods which are among you and
[1:28:42] incline your heart unto the Lord God of
[1:28:46] Israel and the people said unto Joshua
[1:28:49] the Lord Our God will we serve and his
[1:28:51] voice will we we
[1:28:52] obey so Joshua made a covenant with the
[1:28:55] people that day and set them a statute
[1:28:58] and an ordinance and shck
[1:29:00] them did they do
[1:29:03] it did they serve the Lord and not
[1:29:06] forsake his ways and Obey him the people
[1:29:08] that took this pledge skipping to verse
[1:29:10] 31 we read and Israel served the Lord
[1:29:15] all the days of Joshua and all the days
[1:29:19] of the elders that outlived Joshua which
[1:29:21] had known all The Works of the Lord that
[1:29:23] he had done for
[1:29:24] Israel so I think the answer is yes they
[1:29:28] made that pledge and they fulfilled it
[1:29:30] but
[1:29:31] sadly many in the following Generations
[1:29:34] did not as we'll see as we continue
[1:29:36] through the
[1:29:37] Bible and Joshua the first of the
[1:29:40] history books ends much as Genesis the
[1:29:45] first book of the Torah with mention of
[1:29:48] the bones of Joseph also in the second
[1:29:52] to last verse just as it was in Genesis
[1:29:55] we
[1:29:56] read and the bones of Joseph which the
[1:30:00] children of Israel brought up out of
[1:30:02] Egypt buried they in
[1:30:05] sheim and a parcel of ground which Jacob
[1:30:09] bought of the sons of hamor the father
[1:30:11] of shakam for 100 pieces of silver back
[1:30:14] in Genesis 33 and it became the
[1:30:17] inheritance of the children of Joseph
[1:30:21] it's the musicians would please come
[1:30:24] sheum is a city on the border between
[1:30:27] Manasseh and Ephraim it's hard to see
[1:30:29] there I've circled sheam and this kind
[1:30:31] of gray area is a territory of rhri and
[1:30:34] this green area above is ter territory
[1:30:36] of manasse sheum lies in both
[1:30:39] territories it's a
[1:30:43] border it's on the border between
[1:30:45] manasse and ephriam which are the sons
[1:30:48] of Joseph it's the sight of the horrible
[1:30:51] Massacre by Sim and Levi it's the last
[1:30:53] place in Canaan where Joseph had peace
[1:30:58] his neck stop searching for his brothers
[1:31:00] in Genesis was when he went from shakum
[1:31:02] to Dothan and was there beaten and sold
[1:31:04] into slavery thus Joseph's bones are
[1:31:07] laid to rest in peace in the very spot
[1:31:09] of his inheritance shared by his two
[1:31:12] sons whom Jacob had claimed as his own
[1:31:14] and on the very plot of land Jacob
[1:31:16] purchased some 500 years earlier and
[1:31:20] that's not all was one of the six Cities
[1:31:23] of Refuge speaking both of mercy and
[1:31:27] Justice what a poetically beautiful and
[1:31:30] fitting way to end the first of the book
[1:31:33] of
[1:31:35] histories along the way this evening we
[1:31:37] noted a number of things we can relate
[1:31:39] to I think in our lives today lessons of
[1:31:42] Faith consistency not jumping to
[1:31:45] conclusions not judging others not
[1:31:48] relying on second or third hand reports
[1:31:50] or imputing motives motive or intent and
[1:31:53] so on to follow the lord as he guides us
[1:31:56] through life and not be distracted from
[1:31:59] this primary goal or mission to be
[1:32:02] obedient to do the things the lord
[1:32:04] requires of
[1:32:06] us aren't you glad that this book has
[1:32:09] been preserved for us by faithful
[1:32:11] scribes for three and a half thousand
[1:32:13] years and its story contains lessons
[1:32:17] that are so Timeless we can apply them
[1:32:20] profitably to our our lives today in
[1:32:23] Tucson in
[1:32:25] 2021 as our pastor comes to close the
[1:32:28] service and thinking about Joshua as
[1:32:30] well as the theme of the service on
[1:32:32] Sunday morning making room in our heart
[1:32:34] for God to write his story let's worship
[1:32:39] together and
[1:32:41] song with Jesus be the Lord of all the
[1:32:45] kingdoms of my
[1:32:48] heart Jesus be
[1:32:52] the Lord of
[1:32:55] all Jesus be the Lord of
[1:33:02] all Jesus be the Lord of all the
[1:33:09] kingdoms of my
[1:33:14] heart
[1:33:15] Jesus I
[1:33:18] surrender
[1:33:20] all Jesus I
[1:33:25] surrender
[1:33:27] all
[1:33:28] Jesus I
[1:33:31] surrender all the
[1:33:35] kingdoms of my
[1:33:39] heart Jesus be the Lord of
[1:33:45] all Jesus be the Lord of all
[1:33:53] Jesus be the Lord of all the
[1:33:59] kingom of my
[1:34:02] heart for if he's not Lord of
[1:34:09] everything then he's not
[1:34:12] Lord at
[1:34:14] all God bless you
[1:34:18] brother
[1:34:20] amen I uh want to highlight a couple
[1:34:23] things our brother
[1:34:25] said one thing is a bit humorous when
[1:34:28] the Lord was telling Joshua you had to
[1:34:31] tell him a couple times you are
[1:34:34] old and you are stricken in
[1:34:37] years when that angel stood before
[1:34:40] Joshua when he looked out and he saw
[1:34:42] this man in armor coming with his sword
[1:34:44] and and and how powerful he
[1:34:47] looked that man that was coming towards
[1:34:50] Joshua was not an old
[1:34:53] man Joshua looked at him he drew his
[1:34:56] sword and he said are you for us or are
[1:34:59] you for an
[1:35:01] enemy I think Joshua was like 80 years
[1:35:04] old wasn't he about that when that
[1:35:06] happened so Joshua was not aware of his
[1:35:09] age he didn't care Caleb wasn't aware of
[1:35:12] his age either when Caleb is as uh
[1:35:16] brother Lyall said when Caleb came to
[1:35:18] get his inheritance he looked up at the
[1:35:20] mountains and he saw this hill country
[1:35:22] of Judea and he said I want these Hills
[1:35:27] I want to take that mountain right there
[1:35:29] and that mountain just happened to be
[1:35:31] full of giants the
[1:35:34] Anakin and Joshua said I want to take it
[1:35:37] or Caleb said I want to take it Same
[1:35:39] Spirit as he had before as Joshua had I
[1:35:44] also want to point out I believe it was
[1:35:47] in
[1:35:48] Joshua chapter 22 I believe believe that
[1:35:51] you said when um it was Reuben and Gad
[1:35:58] and manasse good job on the firstborn
[1:36:01] that that helped me Reuben and Gad and
[1:36:05] manasse they built this Altar and they
[1:36:09] wanted it for
[1:36:11] Fellowship they wanted to reach out to
[1:36:13] their Brethren just like Joshua had
[1:36:16] built had built the stones at gilgal and
[1:36:19] placed them there they had placed this
[1:36:22] Memorial there am I right and it was for
[1:36:25] Fellowship they wanted to say hey here's
[1:36:27] what happened
[1:36:28] here and word got
[1:36:31] out to the other
[1:36:34] tribes and they thought that these
[1:36:37] people had fallen into
[1:36:40] idolatry they thought that these people
[1:36:42] had fallen into sin and they started
[1:36:46] preparing for battle this would have
[1:36:47] been a civil war between this country
[1:36:50] that had just formed
[1:36:52] and it was all because of a
[1:36:54] misunderstanding Thank God as brother
[1:36:56] Lyall said thank God they thought enough
[1:36:58] of each other to talk to each other and
[1:37:01] how many times do we fail at doing that
[1:37:04] let's all
[1:37:07] stand do you
[1:37:09] appreciate brother Lyle in the Book of
[1:37:15] Joshua I do too what a powerful story
[1:37:20] this is when this is is what they had
[1:37:21] all wanted for 40 years they wandered in
[1:37:25] the wilderness and only two of them went
[1:37:27] over Joshua and Caleb they went over and
[1:37:30] the walls of Jericho and brother Lyall
[1:37:33] even showed us the archaeological
[1:37:35] evidence the walls of Jericho fell
[1:37:38] down they went through and all of these
[1:37:41] great stories and all of these great
