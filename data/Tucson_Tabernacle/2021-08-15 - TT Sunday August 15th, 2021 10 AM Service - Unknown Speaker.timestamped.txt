[42:10] thank you musicians
[42:12] god bless you may be seated for a few
[42:14] moments
[42:18] just a few
[42:20] a few things to inform you of and remind
[42:23] you
[42:24] and i know the
[42:26] number one question in a lot of people
[42:28] is
[42:29] where where are we at with brother matt
[42:33] and the church
[42:35] we had a meeting with him on this past
[42:37] friday
[42:39] phone conference and
[42:41] probably for
[42:43] half an hour to 45 minutes
[42:45] just going over things and
[42:48] a lot of questions
[42:50] with few answers let's just be honest
[42:52] about that
[42:54] spoke with the brothers and say how do
[42:56] we
[42:57] brother matt's words was you tell the
[42:58] congregation
[43:00] what i've said to you
[43:03] and uh
[43:05] oh
[43:06] four of us heard it four of us probably
[43:08] heard it a little different
[43:10] so
[43:11] i'll uh we spoke and i just said we'll
[43:13] just say it as best we can in the honest
[43:16] way
[43:18] brother matt told us there are things
[43:19] that have cleared up for them
[43:21] things that they had questions on
[43:23] and the lord has made them clear
[43:26] but there are still some things that
[43:28] they're asking about
[43:29] and he asked us to give him one more
[43:31] week
[43:33] the question was asked
[43:36] why don't we go
[43:37] elsewhere now
[43:39] the honest truth we don't have an
[43:40] elsewhere to go right now
[43:43] we haven't don't have a list or a line
[43:45] of brothers waiting
[43:47] and the few brothers that
[43:50] and let me just say it this way have
[43:52] come up and said i want to be your
[43:54] pastor
[43:56] generally those aren't the ones that
[43:57] you're looking for
[43:59] um
[44:01] i had this
[44:03] sitting in the office with brother green
[44:05] over the years and if if you were here
[44:08] at that time brother greene called us
[44:10] the pastors
[44:12] myself
[44:13] brother dale smith brother newton
[44:15] bennett
[44:16] brother caleb duran he called us the
[44:18] pastors all the time
[44:21] and um
[44:23] him being the senior pastor and
[44:25] it's a responsibility
[44:28] that until you've actually been there
[44:31] you realize how much
[44:33] how heavy it is
[44:35] but if god has called you to do it you
[44:37] can bear the burden
[44:39] and we we would look at at brother green
[44:41] and we would say big shoulders
[44:44] big big man could carry
[44:46] but i've seen some little pastors and
[44:48] did they do the same thing so it's not
[44:50] in the stature of the man but it's in
[44:53] god
[44:54] taking care of that so
[44:56] you know
[44:57] we were talking myself and the brothers
[45:00] we haven't
[45:01] gone out quote unquote looking for
[45:03] another brother right now
[45:05] but we also know that god is in charge
[45:07] and we must rest in that so
[45:10] brother matthew
[45:11] in speaking to us
[45:13] he asked us if we would give him about
[45:15] another week there is something personal
[45:17] that him and sister rachel
[45:19] are asking the lord to answer for them
[45:22] um but some things were made clearer
[45:25] some things
[45:26] we i we as he as he told it to us
[45:29] some of the
[45:30] in the words he used the clouds
[45:32] and sometimes it is there's just there's
[45:34] not a clear vision
[45:36] do i go this way do we go that way
[45:39] so
[45:40] um
[45:42] i would love to say we have all the
[45:43] answers we don't
[45:45] but there is one
[45:47] that knows exactly
[45:49] and he's the one that we should be
[45:50] talking to every day
[45:52] sometimes we talk to each other more
[45:54] than we talk to him
[45:55] but we should be talking to him every
[45:57] day so
[45:58] um i know that didn't answer a whole lot
[46:00] but i can't tell you a whole lot more
[46:02] because i don't know any more than that
[46:04] and it's not that we're we're not trying
[46:06] we are praying we are asking the lord
[46:08] um and every day
[46:10] but god is mindful i shared with you
[46:14] something the lord did for me a couple
[46:15] of weeks ago
[46:17] in that one house where the painter had
[46:19] the music on
[46:21] and it was playing over and over and it
[46:23] was
[46:24] music that goes way back
[46:26] as a younger man i remembered i never
[46:28] sang those songs i never listened to
[46:29] those songs and never had those those
[46:31] stations on
[46:32] but you remember them
[46:34] and when i left that that house after
[46:36] working in there for a couple hours i
[46:38] couldn't get one of those songs out of
[46:39] my head
[46:41] and i don't know if you've done it but
[46:42] there's one line of the song that you
[46:44] remember and it just goes over and over
[46:45] and over and you wish you could unplug
[46:48] that thing and it can't
[46:50] so as i was driving down the road i
[46:51] asked the lord how do i get rid of this
[46:54] in my mind and as soon as i said that
[46:57] that song
[46:59] he began and i said he began because
[47:00] it's it's the lord that does these
[47:02] things
[47:04] think about his love
[47:05] think about his goodness just begin to
[47:08] sing in my mind i told my wife this
[47:11] morning it has been different from that
[47:12] day this way
[47:14] because god did it
[47:16] i tried a lot of different ways i've
[47:18] shared with you the time that i
[47:19] unplugged his radio i cut his cord
[47:23] he fixed and started it back again
[47:25] and i finally asked the lord what can
[47:27] you do about this
[47:29] and he kind of said well why didn't you
[47:31] ask me a long time ago instead of trying
[47:32] to do this yourself
[47:34] i didn't ask for the young man to be
[47:36] fired but they fired him right after
[47:38] that and his radio went with him
[47:40] i didn't ask that but that's how god
[47:42] arranged it
[47:43] let's leave it in god's hands
[47:46] let's tell him lord we're going to pray
[47:47] we're going to ask we're going to trust
[47:49] in you or we're going to leave it in
[47:50] your hands so
[47:53] and i know that that it is a great
[47:55] concern for this church and it is for
[47:56] all of us
[47:58] but today there are things that other
[48:00] families are going having a hard time
[48:02] with right now
[48:05] the ramirez gaxiola family if you saw in
[48:07] the whatsapp are sister olga
[48:10] brother zion the youngest son was
[48:12] supposed to be coming into town today
[48:14] there's a decision on what would have to
[48:16] be done with our sister the doctors give
[48:18] her no hope
[48:19] she was part of this congregation part
[48:21] of the family for many years here
[48:25] brother if you saw the what's up brother
[48:28] edugal's son-in-law matt sanger lost his
[48:30] father yesterday
[48:32] now it's a loss in the flesh but if the
[48:34] father goes home to the lord
[48:36] there is a comfort in that
[48:38] and of course we know
[48:41] sister pruitt passing on and and the
[48:43] effect of that
[48:45] as a mother as a wife
[48:47] as a grandmother as a
[48:49] as part of a church for many years
[48:52] it's a hard time
[48:54] and then the rojas family it was part of
[48:56] our congregation for quite some time
[48:59] both the father and son were in the
[49:01] hospital at the same time with covid
[49:04] one at
[49:05] banner south which is the old keno and
[49:07] one is the old u of a hospital
[49:10] and the son i believe he was in his
[49:11] early 30s passed away several weeks ago
[49:15] and yesterday the day before dad
[49:18] rojas passed away
[49:20] so today they're making plans to bury
[49:23] the dad and the son
[49:26] and
[49:27] it's part of life
[49:30] if god doesn't come tomorrow somebody
[49:32] else will cross over
[49:34] but my expectation is lord if you don't
[49:37] come tomorrow and i go home tomorrow i'm
[49:39] just going to go be with you
[49:42] i'm trusting that everything is written
[49:44] but again sometimes we get caught up
[49:46] close to what's affecting us and forget
[49:48] that are others that are that are
[49:49] suffering and going through a hard time
[49:51] so
[49:52] let's remember those
[49:54] and in no way am i saying you're not
[49:56] having a hard time but sometimes
[49:58] we just have to stop for a minute and
[49:59] say lord you've been good to me
[50:02] but remember my brother remember my
[50:03] sister so
[50:06] sometimes it's
[50:07] oh it's it's all of us there's not one
[50:09] of us that's that hasn't gone through
[50:11] this you just you can't get past that
[50:13] that you're going through
[50:15] and as i was kneeling down praying as
[50:18] the service started in there
[50:21] i've i've come in
[50:23] some of the brothers leave the door open
[50:25] some close the door
[50:27] i walked in and one brother had his arms
[50:29] just walking back and forth worshiping
[50:31] the lord back there
[50:32] other brothers kneeling down
[50:34] one brother i thought he was asleep he
[50:36] was just deeply concentrating
[50:38] everybody said right now down to pray
[50:41] i began to thank the god for his mercy
[50:43] for listening to us
[50:45] for hearing us for
[50:46] for for being part of us
[50:48] and willing
[50:50] and it just
[50:52] just how he speaks to me what he does
[50:54] for me and and to each one as an
[50:55] individual
[50:57] you know how god deals with you
[51:00] i begin to think about
[51:02] him being able to be touched by the
[51:04] feeling of our infirmities
[51:06] by our feelings by our hurts by the
[51:08] things we're going through by our
[51:09] questions
[51:12] you know maybe the robert's family
[51:14] looking there with with sister sarah and
[51:15] if sister sarah could run up and take
[51:17] care of everything she would she's a mom
[51:19] but sometimes you can't and you go
[51:22] through these things and
[51:24] i just felt that the lord showed me he
[51:26] goes that's why i took on flesh
[51:31] or else i'd just be like a god of stone
[51:34] to you
[51:35] could not be touched by the filling of
[51:38] your infirmities
[51:39] i don't know maybe all of you have seen
[51:40] that before but it just spoke so much i
[51:43] took on flesh i robed myself in flesh i
[51:46] hurt i cried i suffered so that when you
[51:50] talk to me i would understand
[51:52] it became so real or else i would just
[51:54] be
[51:55] a god
[51:56] on a piece of stone that you were
[51:58] worshiping a picture a figure something
[52:01] but no i'm the lord god that healeth
[52:03] thee
[52:04] i'm the lord god that can be touched by
[52:06] your anxieties your worries your
[52:08] nervousness
[52:10] he knew those disciples going across on
[52:12] the boat
[52:14] after he had just fed five thousand
[52:17] he knew what they were going to go
[52:18] through
[52:19] but he had to get on the other side and
[52:21] he had to get spent some time talking to
[52:23] the lord himself
[52:25] and as he comes walking down over the
[52:26] over the water right over the water
[52:29] you would think peter and all them said
[52:31] that has to be the lord he's the only
[52:32] one that can do those things
[52:34] well what was their question is that you
[52:36] lord
[52:38] that would give you the impression that
[52:40] peter had seen a lot of people walking
[52:41] on the water didn't know for sure who it
[52:42] was huh
[52:43] no i think it was the first time peter
[52:45] ever saw somebody walk on the water yet
[52:47] he still questioned
[52:49] he still asked is that you lord
[52:52] and he said is it i
[52:54] i wonder sometimes if come on peter if
[52:57] you if you could have been there with
[52:58] the lord peter who else would it be you
[53:00] know but he says come peter
[53:03] and i'm glad that he does that for all
[53:05] of us every time
[53:07] and and maybe you today you're strong in
[53:09] faith tomorrow you have a hard time but
[53:11] god says come on brother eddie come on
[53:14] it's all right
[53:16] i just i just
[53:18] just understand the lord is with us he's
[53:20] not left us
[53:22] you know it's it's it's he said i'll be
[53:24] with you even in you
[53:26] i'm gonna take him at his word
[53:28] over what i'm thinking and what i'm
[53:30] feeling
[53:31] because my thoughts and my feelings will
[53:33] fail me
[53:34] but god's word
[53:36] never fails
[53:37] and that's our hope so
[53:39] and it's more than a hope it's an
[53:41] experience that you've had with god and
[53:43] he's faithful so
[53:47] you may be seated we'll read the first
[53:49] scripture
[53:51] there and then
[53:53] if i was going to
[53:55] say we'll continue from last sunday our
[53:57] hope our expectation our desire
[54:01] but i trust that we've had enough
[54:03] experiences with god that we know he
[54:05] fulfills
[54:07] we're not hoping he does but you have to
[54:10] have a hope
[54:12] you can't be a hopeless people you can't
[54:14] be in despair
[54:17] but hope becomes a reality in god
[54:20] it's more than just walking with a hope
[54:23] but there is a hope
[54:25] trying to find that
[54:27] right balance
[54:28] psalms 119
[54:31] well three three verses of psalms 119.
[54:36] brother lyle i might have been a little
[54:37] bit like you were
[54:39] up to yesterday afternoon
[54:41] how's this gonna go
[54:44] i thought maybe i'll call brother lyles
[54:45] that you're preaching in the morning
[54:48] no i wouldn't do that i wouldn't do that
[54:50] but then god just if you just surrender
[54:53] yourself and yield yourself okay lord
[54:55] you do that so
[54:57] david said thy word have i hid in my
[54:59] heart
[55:00] that i might not sin against see
[55:04] if if you know you can look at that
[55:06] literally
[55:08] have i hid in my heart
[55:10] you know we kind of say right here
[55:13] but it's it's it's also an attitude you
[55:15] take it's also an uh
[55:17] a a a spirit could i say it's the holy
[55:20] spirit that does that for you
[55:22] i've put it in there and i check what
[55:25] i'm doing against the word of god
[55:28] it's the checkpoint that i have it's
[55:30] that that says
[55:31] is that what god would want it does is
[55:34] it what the word of god says it is is it
[55:36] what we've been taught or is it just my
[55:38] feeling is it just something
[55:40] david went through a lot of things in
[55:42] life
[55:43] as a young man being told you are being
[55:46] anointed king over israel
[55:50] as a young man could you imagine
[55:53] let me let me find a young man here
[55:58] i have to go with brother eddie because
[55:59] i can remember his name
[56:02] what if i told you brother eddie the
[56:04] lord told me to tell you you're the
[56:05] pastor starting tomorrow
[56:07] that door would provide me wide open
[56:08] you'd be going out there but but put
[56:10] yourself in in in david's place he's not
[56:13] tending the sheep
[56:15] he's not even aware that samuel has come
[56:17] to his father's house
[56:18] the other brothers have samuel hass
[56:21] i mean
[56:23] jesse has
[56:24] they know when the prophet comes he's
[56:26] coming for a reason
[56:29] they prepare and he says the lord the
[56:31] salmon times the lord has sent me here
[56:34] to anoint your son as king over israel
[56:36] he has refused saul
[56:40] well
[56:41] of course the oldest son comes first
[56:43] and as they go down the line they
[56:45] started with peter
[56:47] too bad you don't have six or seven
[56:48] brothers
[56:50] you should go down the line
[56:52] until there was but one left and samuel
[56:54] knew god had told him go to jesse's
[56:56] house and anoint
[56:58] his son as king over israel
[57:01] so when jesse says that's all of them
[57:03] samuel says there's got to be another
[57:04] one god doesn't god doesn't make
[57:06] mistakes and then jesse goes yeah but
[57:08] he's my youngest and he's out tending
[57:10] the sheep really jesse is saying it
[57:13] can't be him
[57:15] and samuel says go bring him
[57:18] and he comes and samuel says this is the
[57:20] one
[57:22] it does not tell us immediately how
[57:24] david reacted but david it had to be
[57:27] quite a shock i'm sure
[57:29] me king
[57:30] he probably looked at his brother's he's
[57:33] more capable he's he's he's older than
[57:35] me he has more experience
[57:38] but david had a heart before god
[57:42] and that's what god was looking he told
[57:44] samuel he says you look at the outward
[57:46] you look at the outward appearance of
[57:48] man
[57:49] but i look down into the heart
[57:51] i look what to see what's motivating i
[57:53] look to see what's causing that to
[57:56] happen
[57:57] now sometimes we look at our heart and
[57:59] you say oh lord help me
[58:01] because i know some of the thoughts and
[58:02] some of the intentions that have gone
[58:04] through my heart
[58:05] gone through my mind i have to say lord
[58:06] let me get rid of that quickly
[58:09] you know brother brown when he says that
[58:11] brother green reminded us many times you
[58:13] can't keep the birds from flying over
[58:14] your head
[58:16] but you can keep them from making a nest
[58:19] because getting rid of the nest is the
[58:20] hardest part
[58:23] it's easier to let the thoughts go
[58:24] through
[58:26] as quick as they can
[58:28] say lord forgive me and help me to go on
[58:30] and david just says i have hid thy word
[58:32] in my heart and against that will i
[58:35] check every motive every spirit and
[58:36] every desire
[58:38] is this acceptable to you lord
[58:40] and then in verse 14
[58:44] this is a scripture that caught my
[58:46] attention i have rejoiced in the way of
[58:48] thy testimonies
[58:50] as much as in all riches
[58:54] and then maybe i have taken as much
[58:56] delight in the way of your unchanging
[58:58] word
[58:59] as in all wealth
[59:02] when you find something that doesn't
[59:04] fail
[59:05] it's consistent
[59:07] it works every time without fail
[59:10] then you can anchor right down on that
[59:13] but if sometimes
[59:15] dad says yes and dad says no the next
[59:18] time
[59:20] or as naomi got a good laugh today
[59:23] i'm wearing my tie and asking my wife
[59:25] where is it
[59:27] because this button was a little tight
[59:29] so she was trying to adjust it didn't
[59:31] realize the tie got pulled down and i'm
[59:32] saying okay now what did you do with my
[59:34] tie
[59:35] and she goes you're wearing it i looked
[59:37] down guess what i was wearing it
[59:40] mama told her and i walk into the
[59:42] kitchen and she is laughing over there
[59:45] things happen to us okay
[59:48] but he's the faithful one
[59:50] david says i have rejoiced in the way of
[59:53] thy test the keeping of your word the
[59:55] pro everything that is said about you is
[59:57] so true and faithful and i rejoice in
[59:59] that more than all that i have acquired
[1:00:03] he says
[1:00:04] and then verse 24
[1:00:08] thy testimonies also are my delight
[1:00:11] and my counselors
[1:00:13] your unchanging word is my delight and
[1:00:16] the guide of my footsteps
[1:00:20] lord i need to go forward i need this
[1:00:22] what is your word what do you how would
[1:00:24] you lead me how would you direct me now
[1:00:26] i pray that if you're a faithful worker
[1:00:28] you don't get up in the morning and ask
[1:00:30] the lord if you should go to work today
[1:00:32] i think you already know that there are
[1:00:34] things that we know to do be kind to
[1:00:36] your neighbor love one another we should
[1:00:38] not be asking the lord do i need to love
[1:00:40] my neighbor today or it might excuse it
[1:00:42] those are givens
[1:00:44] but there's things in our lives that we
[1:00:46] get down we say lord i need some
[1:00:47] direction in life i need to know which
[1:00:49] way i need to go here
[1:00:52] and david said thy testimonies thy word
[1:00:54] thy unchanging word
[1:00:56] are also mighty light and the director
[1:00:59] of my footsteps
[1:01:02] so again
[1:01:03] just taking that and saying what is our
[1:01:06] expectation he tells us in his word what
[1:01:09] you can expect of him
[1:01:12] and he never fails so let's read the
[1:01:14] first there's just two quotes that i
[1:01:16] pulled up here i'd like to
[1:01:18] let's read those together and how many
[1:01:21] appreciate now being able to see
[1:01:23] and and
[1:01:24] i got up here and brother ed says can
[1:01:26] you stand over the pulpit before service
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:29] let's adjust the lights so it's not too
[1:01:31] bright
[1:01:32] and i was like wow i can see up here
[1:01:35] that's good and i appreciate all those
[1:01:36] things
[1:01:37] the simple things that that help us do
[1:01:40] we're where we might be working with a
[1:01:41] candlelight today or we might be working
[1:01:44] outside or i see some of the the uh
[1:01:47] pictures that our brother the elano
[1:01:49] brothers that sang for us here part of
[1:01:51] wmo the work they do in africa and other
[1:01:53] place and they're they're in in
[1:01:55] buildings that are just of mud and straw
[1:01:57] and they're
[1:01:58] but they're worshiping and loving the
[1:01:59] lord anyways but i appreciate that he
[1:02:02] allows us
[1:02:04] brother branham it just took the word
[1:02:05] expectation and he says and now last
[1:02:08] evening we were speaking on discipline
[1:02:10] in the church
[1:02:11] and i think if we could just get the
[1:02:13] church in a real spiritual attitude
[1:02:16] then there will be a revival really in
[1:02:18] it and it'll be so much better for our
[1:02:20] prayers for the sick
[1:02:22] as long as our conditions are slumping
[1:02:24] then we just don't seem to pick it up
[1:02:26] like we should
[1:02:27] but when everybody is just prayed up and
[1:02:30] keep high and a great expectation
[1:02:33] i've walked to the platform and many
[1:02:35] times be five six seven thousand people
[1:02:38] and not be one feeble person left just
[1:02:41] as soon as you walked out on the
[1:02:42] platform
[1:02:43] everyone gets up out of wheelchairs and
[1:02:45] cots and stretchers and everything walk
[1:02:48] right away because
[1:02:50] he says they just you're under such
[1:02:53] expectations
[1:02:55] now that was in the days of the early
[1:02:56] beginning of the ministry before there
[1:02:58] was anyone else in the field and it it
[1:03:00] had been kind of a letdown for a while
[1:03:03] so thou now everybody it it was new and
[1:03:05] the people were just expecting anything
[1:03:09] now watch what he says and now if you
[1:03:10] had the same expect expectations
[1:03:13] you'd get the same results god has not
[1:03:16] lessened there's not less of god today
[1:03:19] and and i've heard this and and there
[1:03:21] it's true we have the full word of god
[1:03:23] today
[1:03:24] but he's still the same yesterday today
[1:03:26] and forever
[1:03:27] when somebody and i've had people tell
[1:03:29] me brother i'm so in the word i don't
[1:03:31] need any of that
[1:03:33] i'm sorry i need all of god
[1:03:36] but through the unveiling of the word he
[1:03:38] just made it more real to me than it's
[1:03:40] ever been
[1:03:42] i am the lord god that healeth all
[1:03:44] thy diseases
[1:03:46] and i want to stand on that i want to
[1:03:48] believe on that i want to take that
[1:03:50] the next quote there's just two of them
[1:03:51] today
[1:03:56] dear heavenly father i am so grateful to
[1:03:58] know that there's still faith moving in
[1:04:00] the earth oh the great hour just now
[1:04:03] when we're expecting some great
[1:04:04] something to take place a believing
[1:04:06] people they believe because you've told
[1:04:09] them these things and you said to
[1:04:11] nathanael you shall see greater things
[1:04:13] than this
[1:04:14] grant it now lord
[1:04:16] may they be conscious that christ keeps
[1:04:19] every word in every promise
[1:04:21] may the holy spirit come powerfully upon
[1:04:23] this audience just now and that there
[1:04:26] would then and if there would be a
[1:04:28] shadow of doubt anywhere
[1:04:31] i think we could finish it let that be
[1:04:33] done with let it be cast away
[1:04:36] he didn't say that was only for that
[1:04:39] time
[1:04:40] and of course we know when brother
[1:04:42] branham first gets out in the field
[1:04:44] something had to draw the people to him
[1:04:47] something to say hey this is different
[1:04:49] just like when philip goes and meets
[1:04:51] nathanael
[1:04:52] nathanael says
[1:04:54] what's different nothing's good ever
[1:04:55] come out of there city
[1:04:57] let's just that's just kind of what he's
[1:04:59] thinking nothing good has ever come from
[1:05:01] there tell me what's different
[1:05:03] and philip says come see a man
[1:05:06] just come and find out for yourself
[1:05:10] you know we we we shared this testimony
[1:05:12] with
[1:05:13] when brother frank lopez they had the
[1:05:14] memorial here a friend of my father's i
[1:05:17] asked him after his when did he meet
[1:05:19] brother frank in 1953 they met back in
[1:05:21] california
[1:05:23] i asked my dad do you remember there in
[1:05:25] southern california when brother branham
[1:05:26] came through and he said yeah but they
[1:05:28] told us not to go because he was a false
[1:05:29] teacher so we didn't go
[1:05:32] brother tony ramirez i didn't know this
[1:05:34] he shared with me that he did go to
[1:05:36] under brother matt brown's meetings in
[1:05:37] in up in the fresno area somewhere up
[1:05:39] there
[1:05:40] in california but they got there late
[1:05:42] and it was so crowded they were way in
[1:05:44] the back and never really got to see him
[1:05:46] we just heard them from a long
[1:05:48] distance but brother frank's pastor told
[1:05:51] them let's go
[1:05:52] just don't listen to what he's got to
[1:05:54] say but he's a great healer there's
[1:05:56] great miracles let's go see what god
[1:05:58] does so brother frank told me or the
[1:06:01] they told me his testimony was he took
[1:06:02] his bible because he was going to go
[1:06:04] prove brother brahm wrong he was going
[1:06:05] to show brethren i'll show him where
[1:06:06] he's wrong in the scriptures
[1:06:09] i trust that we would have enough
[1:06:11] confidence that we could take the
[1:06:12] scriptures and say
[1:06:14] i'm going to show you by the scripture
[1:06:16] not by my opinion
[1:06:18] and if i'm seeing it wrong and i will
[1:06:19] approach that god will allow me to see
[1:06:21] it right
[1:06:22] he's not going to allow me to teach
[1:06:23] somebody wrong
[1:06:25] so brother branham made a statement and
[1:06:27] brother frank opened the bible and said
[1:06:28] well it says that in the bible
[1:06:30] brother brown said all things he opened
[1:06:31] the scripture it says that too
[1:06:33] but frank said when it was all said and
[1:06:35] done everything brother brahm said was
[1:06:36] in the scriptures
[1:06:38] didn't find anything that wasn't
[1:06:40] so they got together as a congregation
[1:06:42] or the with the pastor after he said
[1:06:43] what do you think
[1:06:45] so brother frank began to share with the
[1:06:47] pastor
[1:06:48] well everything he said is in here
[1:06:50] pastor got upset and threw him out of
[1:06:52] church
[1:06:54] dad said i didn't see him anymore he
[1:06:55] disappeared we moved to tucson brother
[1:06:57] franken come
[1:06:58] to tucson to follow this message
[1:07:00] because
[1:07:02] it was in the word of god
[1:07:04] and if you're a child of god the word of
[1:07:06] god draws you to him
[1:07:09] and if he's proven himself to be
[1:07:11] faithful unfailing
[1:07:13] then such a confidence can be built
[1:07:15] you can't always keep my word i can't
[1:07:17] always keep your word because we happen
[1:07:19] to be human
[1:07:21] we make a promise and something comes up
[1:07:23] we can't
[1:07:24] you know maybe you're feeling really
[1:07:26] good in the morning and in the evening
[1:07:27] you're not feeling well a situation
[1:07:29] comes up and you have to say sorry i
[1:07:31] can't make it
[1:07:33] but jesus never fails
[1:07:35] he keeps every one of his appointments
[1:07:38] now
[1:07:40] understand he keeps his appointments
[1:07:43] i don't set my appointments for him
[1:07:45] he sets them for me
[1:07:48] i don't dictate to what god is going to
[1:07:50] do i just get on my knees and say lord i
[1:07:52] need your help
[1:07:53] and let him come
[1:07:55] and he doesn't always come the way i
[1:07:57] think because if i'm looking at this and
[1:07:59] he's doing that i'm going to miss it
[1:08:01] but open my eyes lord i want to see
[1:08:03] jesus
[1:08:06] now the scriptures i'm going to go start
[1:08:08] with the old testament here and i i
[1:08:10] trust
[1:08:12] i i like i said i have my wife usually
[1:08:14] it's her i said i'm going to read you
[1:08:16] the scripture you verify that i got the
[1:08:18] right scripture that i didn't tran
[1:08:21] so i asked her i said
[1:08:23] does this have a continuity how are you
[1:08:25] hearing it you know she's the first one
[1:08:27] usually the one that gets to hear it
[1:08:28] first
[1:08:30] i don't know that she wants to but she
[1:08:32] does
[1:08:34] and i appreciate having a good wife that
[1:08:36] will sit there and do that and encourage
[1:08:40] brothers how many appreciate your wife
[1:08:43] how many honestly know that
[1:08:46] brother brother arnie has both hands and
[1:08:47] standing up is it to rachel
[1:08:51] but it is you know sometimes we get but
[1:08:53] god god has given us
[1:08:55] the one that we
[1:08:57] the one that we needed and
[1:09:00] i believe the one we desired to because
[1:09:02] when we ask god give us
[1:09:04] the desire my heart he does that
[1:09:06] and i know that and
[1:09:08] i asked her five times before she said
[1:09:10] yes
[1:09:13] and uh
[1:09:14] but she did say yes
[1:09:16] and every once in a while she said
[1:09:17] something says something to me i said
[1:09:19] but you said yes
[1:09:22] i thank the lord for
[1:09:24] for god giving us that which we have
[1:09:25] need of
[1:09:27] i appreciate that so jeremiah 33 these
[1:09:30] scriptures are all well-known scriptures
[1:09:32] and if you read your bible you should
[1:09:34] they should all be well known scriptures
[1:09:37] he says call unto me and i will answer
[1:09:39] thee
[1:09:40] immediately exactly what you want to
[1:09:42] hear right then and there no he didn't
[1:09:44] say that he just said i will answer thee
[1:09:46] and show the
[1:09:48] great and mighty things which thou
[1:09:50] knowest not
[1:09:52] and i appreciate that because he knows
[1:09:54] the end from the beginning everything in
[1:09:55] between
[1:09:57] and you're saying lord this is what i
[1:09:59] need and he says really you think so huh
[1:10:01] no i know what you need and i know how
[1:10:02] to get it there
[1:10:04] and we have to have that confidence
[1:10:07] one of my favorite scriptures jeremiah
[1:10:08] 29 11
[1:10:12] for i know the thoughts that i think
[1:10:14] towards you
[1:10:16] saith the lord and if we stopped it
[1:10:17] right there some of us would say
[1:10:21] but look thoughts of peace
[1:10:25] and not of evil
[1:10:27] to give you an expected end and what is
[1:10:30] expected and what he promised what he
[1:10:32] said
[1:10:34] because you're his children you're part
[1:10:36] of him
[1:10:38] so you know david david could write
[1:10:39] these scriptures because
[1:10:41] god was influenced and david this is
[1:10:43] what it is you shall be like a tree
[1:10:45] planted by living waters
[1:10:48] you shall root you shall grow you shall
[1:10:49] give fruit in a timely season that was
[1:10:52] god's thoughts
[1:10:54] an expected end
[1:10:56] it's not going to fail
[1:10:59] isaiah 45
[1:11:02] verses 5 and 6.
[1:11:04] just want to establish this something
[1:11:06] that should be well established but
[1:11:08] let's maybe anchor it down a little more
[1:11:10] i am the lord and there is none else
[1:11:14] we've got to be careful
[1:11:16] because we put other things in the way
[1:11:18] but god said
[1:11:20] he realized that we do that but they're
[1:11:21] nothing to him
[1:11:23] he's not having to stop saying oh no i
[1:11:24] got to deal with that guy boy he was a
[1:11:26] battle last time
[1:11:27] no
[1:11:28] he says there is none else
[1:11:31] there is no god beside me
[1:11:33] i girded thee
[1:11:35] though thou hast not known me while i
[1:11:37] did not even realize it was god he was
[1:11:39] already working
[1:11:42] it's not like he had to modify a plan or
[1:11:44] make up a difference or write another
[1:11:46] chapter for me it was already there
[1:11:49] you have to see yourself in god's plan
[1:11:52] if you were the only one he would still
[1:11:54] come and give his life to redeem you
[1:11:59] that they may know from the rising of
[1:12:02] the sun
[1:12:03] in the morning when i rise
[1:12:06] and from the west
[1:12:08] and then you know rise themselves the
[1:12:09] east but it just made me think in the
[1:12:11] morning when it rise mary realized i
[1:12:12] understand right off that your god
[1:12:15] and from the west and there is none
[1:12:17] beside me
[1:12:19] i am the lord and there is none else
[1:12:26] and
[1:12:27] period
[1:12:28] it's done
[1:12:29] there's no question in his mind there's
[1:12:31] nobody like me
[1:12:33] even the stone
[1:12:35] that you took or the goal that you took
[1:12:38] or the wood or whatever you did to build
[1:12:40] that god i made it
[1:12:44] you didn't create that it was created by
[1:12:46] me there is no other god but me
[1:12:50] and he's the only one that can say that
[1:12:54] now there's nobody else but me
[1:12:57] because i'm the only he may like this
[1:12:59] and all of you can say thank god
[1:13:01] that's a little different but he has his
[1:13:03] reasons why
[1:13:05] but him the unfailing god the unchanging
[1:13:08] god
[1:13:10] not having to adjust to different
[1:13:11] seasons not having to adjust to
[1:13:13] different moods i wasn't expecting that
[1:13:15] i wasn't prepared for that now my trip
[1:13:18] has to no
[1:13:19] god has a way
[1:13:20] israel comes he says in 400 years you
[1:13:23] shall sojourn down there in the land of
[1:13:25] egypt
[1:13:26] 400 years and then he says moses go down
[1:13:30] because i keep my word
[1:13:33] and they're rejoicing not only that but
[1:13:37] egypt gives them all the gold everything
[1:13:38] they need they
[1:13:42] brother lyle you know when you when you
[1:13:44] were getting ready to move to this new
[1:13:45] place did your neighbor come over and
[1:13:47] give you everything before you left
[1:13:50] no in fact maybe the neighbor came or
[1:13:51] you're leaving that i'll take it
[1:13:53] it might be the other way around
[1:13:55] but egypt gives israel all their wealth
[1:14:00] that's the god you serve
[1:14:03] he can take one and make a million out
[1:14:05] of it
[1:14:06] when we take a million and make one out
[1:14:07] of it we're not careful
[1:14:09] but he's god
[1:14:11] there is none else he says
[1:14:18] deuteronomy
[1:14:20] the book of two laws
[1:14:22] the law of death and the law of life
[1:14:26] and here god says
[1:14:28] hear o israel the lord our god
[1:14:31] is one lord
[1:14:33] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[1:14:35] with all thine heart and with all thy
[1:14:38] soul and with all thy might that doesn't
[1:14:40] leave room for much else to sir
[1:14:44] and these words which i command thee
[1:14:46] this day shall be
[1:14:48] in thine heart
[1:14:51] let it be first
[1:14:52] let it be uh above everything else no
[1:14:55] there are other things that in life i'm
[1:14:57] not questioning that but all that should
[1:14:59] come underneath uh under that
[1:15:03] hear o israel oh thou spiritual seed of
[1:15:06] israel hear o israel the lord thy god is
[1:15:10] one god
[1:15:11] one lord
[1:15:14] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:15:16] unto thy children
[1:15:17] and shall talk of them when thou sitteth
[1:15:19] in thine house and when they'll walk is
[1:15:22] by the way and when thou liest down and
[1:15:24] when thou risest up
[1:15:27] and if you go look at the new
[1:15:28] translation thou shalt teach them and
[1:15:30] talk about them when you're in church
[1:15:34] he says all the time
[1:15:35] daily continue should be the meditation
[1:15:38] of your heart
[1:15:40] and i know troubles come and i know
[1:15:43] thoughts happen and things happen and
[1:15:44] we're all guilty
[1:15:46] brother bradman was as quick as you can
[1:15:49] make it right get a hold of yourself
[1:15:51] make it he said you should do this and
[1:15:53] thou shalt bind them for a sign
[1:15:55] upon thine hand there shall be as a
[1:15:57] frontlets between thine eyes and thou
[1:16:00] shall write them upon the post of thy
[1:16:02] house and on thy gates and i was reading
[1:16:04] this to my wife or just making sure
[1:16:06] these are the scriptures that that i had
[1:16:09] put down and i remembered in in high
[1:16:11] school back in california i took a world
[1:16:14] religions class because i thought that
[1:16:16] was going to be a class that was going
[1:16:18] to teach me about what the baptists
[1:16:19] believed and
[1:16:21] well world religions if you read the
[1:16:22] title pay attention you realize it
[1:16:24] wasn't going to be that but that's what
[1:16:25] i thought and i wanted to know what the
[1:16:27] lutherans believed in the baptist
[1:16:29] no this was talking about world
[1:16:30] religions but they had two young men
[1:16:33] they were twins i remember one of them
[1:16:35] was steve i can't remember the other
[1:16:36] name and they brought
[1:16:38] the things the the frontlet and the
[1:16:40] things and they demonstrated to us i had
[1:16:42] never seen that before
[1:16:44] how they literally would tie them and
[1:16:45] put them and and that but that's not
[1:16:48] what he's talking about right here for
[1:16:49] us to literally do that it should be in
[1:16:52] our hearts he says
[1:16:53] and thou sh then and thou shalt write
[1:16:55] them upon the post of thy house on thy
[1:16:57] gates
[1:16:58] remembering when brother branham when
[1:17:00] when he any the lord stops the airplane
[1:17:03] in tennessee and puts down and says get
[1:17:05] up and walk when he's in the hotels to
[1:17:07] start walking brother branham prophet of
[1:17:09] god following the leadership of the lord
[1:17:11] and knew when god was talking to him is
[1:17:13] still questioning god while he's walking
[1:17:15] but my plane but my plane but my
[1:17:17] airplane lord
[1:17:20] but he was doing what god told him
[1:17:24] let's just be honest let's be honest
[1:17:26] about ourselves
[1:17:28] i'm doing what god told me to do but
[1:17:29] sometimes i'm still questioning
[1:17:32] i happen to be a little bit human still
[1:17:34] a lot sometimes too much
[1:17:36] but he's walking down there and there's
[1:17:39] a sister
[1:17:41] standing by and he's going to walk right
[1:17:43] past because god hasn't said anything to
[1:17:45] him you're going to this address this
[1:17:46] person he didn't describe he just said
[1:17:48] walk
[1:17:49] brother branham was obedient enough and
[1:17:51] understood at this time that
[1:17:53] that's what he had to do so he begins to
[1:17:55] walk
[1:17:56] and this sister whenever god told her um
[1:17:59] because she asked him where is your
[1:18:02] elijah
[1:18:04] god said oh he's right down the street
[1:18:05] i'll send him your way
[1:18:08] strange how elijah happened to be there
[1:18:09] like god whoa boy that worked out
[1:18:11] perfect man i'm glad i planned that no
[1:18:13] that's how god works
[1:18:15] okay puts a plane down
[1:18:17] for whatever reason the plane had to go
[1:18:18] down delayed it for whatever reason it
[1:18:20] was
[1:18:22] maybe
[1:18:23] something minor they just couldn't find
[1:18:24] it i don't know why the plane stopped
[1:18:27] i know why the plane stopped but i don't
[1:18:28] know what he caused in the plane to stop
[1:18:30] let me say it that way because there was
[1:18:32] a sister down there that needed elijah
[1:18:34] to come by
[1:18:36] and god will stop everything for you if
[1:18:38] you can believe it
[1:18:40] you should believe it for yourself
[1:18:43] you should have come enough experience
[1:18:45] in your life that you know god will stop
[1:18:49] to come and meet you
[1:18:50] he does it
[1:18:52] so she's out there whatever time it was
[1:18:55] she put herself at that front gate and
[1:18:56] said he's coming i'll wait for him here
[1:19:00] brother branham just says morning auntie
[1:19:02] and she says morning parson
[1:19:05] and that catches his attention
[1:19:07] and he turns he goes how'd you know i
[1:19:08] was a parson
[1:19:10] god told me you were coming
[1:19:12] could you imagine being a prophet
[1:19:15] and a sister says the lord told me you
[1:19:16] were coming already
[1:19:19] i'm the prophet i'm the man sister you
[1:19:22] have no
[1:19:23] he said oh my this is god working
[1:19:26] immediately he realized god is working
[1:19:28] if we could just be sensitive hey god
[1:19:30] this is you let me let me pay attention
[1:19:34] he walks into her house and he says oh
[1:19:36] you could tell she was a christian in
[1:19:38] her home
[1:19:39] god bless our home
[1:19:42] thou shalt write them upon the post of
[1:19:44] the house in thy case
[1:19:46] that's what god showed me right there
[1:19:48] there should be a physical evidence
[1:19:51] around you
[1:19:52] that you love the lord
[1:19:54] there should be things that people would
[1:19:56] say hey you're a christian aren't you
[1:19:59] you sisters
[1:20:01] especially you sisters the way you dress
[1:20:03] the way you come the way you act
[1:20:05] and it shouldn't be something honestly
[1:20:08] it shouldn't be something you say well i
[1:20:09] have to it should be the desire of our
[1:20:11] hearts
[1:20:13] you know there's things that brothers
[1:20:14] could do too
[1:20:16] sometimes you'll see the and it's
[1:20:20] maybe it's to the shame of the parents i
[1:20:21] don't know
[1:20:22] i didn't have any boys so i can't tell
[1:20:24] you
[1:20:26] but some of the boys don't look any
[1:20:28] different than the world sometimes yet
[1:20:29] they come to church
[1:20:31] there should be something about us
[1:20:33] that is different
[1:20:35] there should be
[1:20:36] i'm not saying you have to be so weird
[1:20:38] so different i'm just saying let christ
[1:20:40] shine here let him tell you what's good
[1:20:44] what he appreciates you know be like
[1:20:46] david and stan before and they said let
[1:20:49] me tell you let us four eat this meal
[1:20:54] and see if in 10 days
[1:20:56] there's not a difference
[1:21:00] the the the only thing that i've seen in
[1:21:03] in the barber shops
[1:21:05] is the young men that come in
[1:21:07] and they get all these haircuts
[1:21:10] and
[1:21:12] i'm going to be 62. i don't want a
[1:21:14] haircut like that
[1:21:16] but these young men they want to look
[1:21:18] they want to look you know this one
[1:21:19] getting it this way and this one doing
[1:21:21] that and these three years old
[1:21:22] four-year-old dad there and they're
[1:21:23] shaping their hair and everything so
[1:21:25] they can look like
[1:21:27] somebody else that has a hair like that
[1:21:30] and my heart says make me more
[1:21:33] like you
[1:21:36] rather than i want to be like that
[1:21:39] lord let our hearts desire be that
[1:21:41] someone say now that's a christian
[1:21:44] i'd rather suffer persecution for that
[1:21:48] a life lived
[1:21:50] and satan hates it and he'll have him
[1:21:52] come after you
[1:21:54] then because i can't control my mouth
[1:21:57] because i bring that upon myself
[1:22:00] but a life lived satan hates
[1:22:03] he walks sorry he he approaches god
[1:22:05] there the bible tells us he comes and
[1:22:08] and say god asked him where have you
[1:22:09] been oh walk into it from and he says
[1:22:11] have you considered my servant job
[1:22:14] and satan goes well of course you got
[1:22:16] him so protected
[1:22:18] you don't even let me near his house
[1:22:22] give me a chance and i'll get him to
[1:22:24] turn his back on you
[1:22:26] god says okay go
[1:22:29] because job was perfect the bible says
[1:22:32] i'll tell you why job was perfect
[1:22:33] because the scripture says he laid a
[1:22:35] sacrifice every morning
[1:22:38] and god said i look at the sacrifice
[1:22:42] therefore job is perfect
[1:22:45] let let your life
[1:22:47] be a sacrificial life before god
[1:22:50] lord i'm willing to give up i'm willing
[1:22:52] to let this go i'm willing to turn my
[1:22:55] back on that and let you be magnified
[1:22:58] let that be written on the post of thy
[1:23:01] house and on thy gates
[1:23:07] psalms
[1:23:08] 62.
[1:23:11] did we finish that
[1:23:13] i'm sorry we did that tenant let's go
[1:23:15] back where i missed two scriptures there
[1:23:17] 10 and 11 and it shall be when the lord
[1:23:20] thy god shall have brought thee into the
[1:23:22] land which he swear unto thy fathers to
[1:23:24] abraham to isaac and to jacob to give
[1:23:27] thee great and goodly cities which thou
[1:23:30] build us not
[1:23:32] and houses full of good things which
[1:23:33] shall fill us not and wells digged which
[1:23:36] thou s dignant vineyards and olive trees
[1:23:38] which thou plan is not
[1:23:40] when thou shalt have eaten and be full
[1:23:44] every need supplied
[1:23:47] they're all god's in the first place
[1:23:49] he says you're going to go into a land
[1:23:51] and these people think they've taken
[1:23:53] this land and they said but they're
[1:23:54] doing it for you
[1:23:56] you ever looked at it this way god
[1:23:58] allowed those people and they dig the
[1:23:59] wealthy because my children are going to
[1:24:01] come in and it's going to be theirs it
[1:24:02] all belonged to them in the first place
[1:24:07] god has a way of meeting needs
[1:24:10] and he doesn't have to meet him the way
[1:24:12] i think he should do i want him to do
[1:24:14] them the way he knows it's best
[1:24:17] it's it's it's nice to work and out of
[1:24:20] the of the the fruit of thine own labor
[1:24:22] but it's also nice to come and god has
[1:24:24] already had it already
[1:24:26] i appreciate that psalm 62 5-7
[1:24:31] my soul wipe thou only upon god
[1:24:35] for my expectation is from him
[1:24:41] i didn't put god and say god you have to
[1:24:44] do this he said i will do
[1:24:48] this
[1:24:50] and if i think by telling him i'm going
[1:24:52] to and for him no he's way ahead of that
[1:24:55] already he's already made provision
[1:24:58] you're going to go into a land and all
[1:25:00] this is already going to be there you're
[1:25:03] not even going to have to dig you're not
[1:25:04] even going to have to plant it's going
[1:25:06] to be there already he only is my rock
[1:25:09] and my salvation he is my defense i
[1:25:12] shall not be moved
[1:25:14] the god in god is my salvation
[1:25:17] and my glory the rock of my strength and
[1:25:21] my refuge is in god that is david david
[1:25:25] had learned now understand in god do i
[1:25:29] have everything i have need of
[1:25:32] not just because i'm king today i have
[1:25:34] it all he's he spent half of his life
[1:25:37] running while he was a king hiding
[1:25:41] but god he was still king
[1:25:44] you're still a child of god
[1:25:46] you were a child of god in god's mind
[1:25:49] you didn't know until later in life
[1:25:51] but you were always a child of god
[1:25:55] and god is my salvation and my glory the
[1:25:57] rock of my strength
[1:25:59] and my refuge is in god
[1:26:02] now let's go over to the new testament
[1:26:03] and read some scriptures here
[1:26:08] matthew again
[1:26:11] god just puts it straight out heaven and
[1:26:13] earth shall pass away
[1:26:14] but my words shall not pass away they'll
[1:26:17] not come to an end they'll not fail
[1:26:20] they'll not be forgotten they will be
[1:26:22] doing as the sun rises every morning he
[1:26:24] said when the sun neither will i forget
[1:26:27] my promises
[1:26:29] now he gave us things that we could see
[1:26:31] we could understand
[1:26:34] maybe maybe some folks would have a
[1:26:36] greater understanding on on the
[1:26:37] atmosphere than i would have i just know
[1:26:39] that there's air to breathe and i
[1:26:41] breathe it every day
[1:26:44] but i can't tell you how it works
[1:26:48] doctors and scientists could have a
[1:26:50] great explanation
[1:26:52] but they breathe the same way i do
[1:26:55] they still have to
[1:26:59] where's that right
[1:27:01] those are some of the things that i know
[1:27:03] brother lyle has shared that they got to
[1:27:05] do
[1:27:05] but
[1:27:06] they still had to grab it do it with
[1:27:08] their hands they still had to see it
[1:27:09] with these eyes that
[1:27:11] you know
[1:27:12] god is in charge of all of this
[1:27:16] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[1:27:18] words shall not pass away
[1:27:20] and then matthew 11 25 and 26 and i just
[1:27:23] i like this
[1:27:25] and at that time the disciples asked him
[1:27:28] why do you show these things
[1:27:30] in mysteries and then he goes look
[1:27:33] and he's talking to them and he shares
[1:27:35] these things and at that time jesus
[1:27:37] answered and said i thank the o father
[1:27:39] lord of heaven and earth because thou
[1:27:41] has hid these things from the wise and
[1:27:42] prudent and has revealed unto them them
[1:27:46] unto babes
[1:27:47] and why even so father for it seemed
[1:27:49] good in thy sight
[1:27:52] it's what god chose to do
[1:27:55] you know if god came down
[1:27:57] and interviewed each one of us today you
[1:27:59] know sat right here and said brother
[1:28:01] lyle how would you like it down sister
[1:28:03] heather out brother robert and he would
[1:28:04] go down the line
[1:28:06] his book would be about this thick
[1:28:08] with each one of our ideas how we think
[1:28:10] it should be done
[1:28:11] but he says even so father because it
[1:28:14] seemed good in thy sight
[1:28:17] and he's eternal
[1:28:19] he's pure
[1:28:21] what he said the first time brother
[1:28:23] branham teaches this so strongly how he
[1:28:25] did it the first time he's faithful to
[1:28:27] continue because he did it perfect the
[1:28:29] first time
[1:28:32] i'd love to say that every invention
[1:28:34] every time they did it there was no
[1:28:35] testing no it just hit it on
[1:28:39] no why do you think that they
[1:28:41] put no lawsuits against certain vaccines
[1:28:44] and all because they know there's a lot
[1:28:45] of testing and trying and guessing and
[1:28:47] hoping
[1:28:49] but in god it was perfect the first time
[1:28:55] matthew 13
[1:28:57] 10 and 11.
[1:28:59] and this is the disciples came and said
[1:29:01] unto him why speak us thou unto them in
[1:29:04] parables
[1:29:06] he says why why do you show it this way
[1:29:08] why do you kind of make a story a
[1:29:10] drawing and then yes this
[1:29:12] and the answer to them because it is
[1:29:14] given unto you
[1:29:16] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:29:18] heaven
[1:29:19] but to them it is not given
[1:29:24] god had a
[1:29:25] let's just be honest god had a people
[1:29:28] go ahead of thought there were people
[1:29:30] that god said they're going to be part
[1:29:32] of it they're going to receive it
[1:29:34] they're my children it's given to them
[1:29:38] i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of
[1:29:40] god
[1:29:43] i we just sent out my wife and rachel i
[1:29:46] believe did the ancestry
[1:29:49] thing
[1:29:51] and they just sent out mine because they
[1:29:53] really want to know
[1:29:55] about dad
[1:29:58] i hope i hope it's not that
[1:29:59] disappointing but
[1:30:01] you know they're going to look and say
[1:30:03] you know your percentage of that there's
[1:30:05] a part of this there's a little bit of
[1:30:06] this in you there's a little bit of this
[1:30:08] and that
[1:30:10] but i did a checkup the other day
[1:30:13] and i used this dna testing right here
[1:30:17] and said i'm his
[1:30:20] did you find your name in here
[1:30:23] have you found your name in here
[1:30:27] then you go back to god
[1:30:30] you always were
[1:30:31] you always will be
[1:30:34] and his dna is pure
[1:30:36] it's not affected by anything else
[1:30:40] you have to believe that
[1:30:42] you have to stand on that
[1:30:44] i don't know what mine's going to say i
[1:30:46] know listening to the girls
[1:30:49] we're all kind of guessing
[1:30:51] there's a good chance i'm going to have
[1:30:52] indian in me
[1:30:54] there's such a good stuff i'm probably
[1:30:56] going to have some from europe because
[1:30:57] the spaniards came across with the
[1:30:59] indians and that's where the mexican
[1:31:00] came from basically so there's that
[1:31:03] possibility
[1:31:04] one of my daughters wanted french
[1:31:08] she says there has to be french in me
[1:31:12] well i don't know she didn't do the dna
[1:31:14] yet did she so she doesn't know yet
[1:31:18] that's okay
[1:31:20] i just want to be sure of this dna above
[1:31:23] all
[1:31:24] that my lineage throws back to him
[1:31:28] the unfailing one the eternal one
[1:31:33] i i think sometimes what might be in
[1:31:35] there and
[1:31:37] good lord help us
[1:31:41] i don't know if being bad is found in
[1:31:43] there but they might find mine
[1:31:45] some of the things we do like looking
[1:31:47] for our tie that we're wearing you know
[1:31:51] oh my
[1:31:55] so again he tells us
[1:32:01] we were just reading matthew
[1:32:03] 13 10 11
[1:32:05] because it is given unto you to know the
[1:32:07] mysteries of the kingdom of him but to
[1:32:09] them it's not given
[1:32:11] i appreciate that god is so mindful of
[1:32:13] us
[1:32:15] that he opens these doors and says look
[1:32:17] i know you've got a question here's the
[1:32:19] answer
[1:32:20] this is how it goes this is and there's
[1:32:23] just a peace
[1:32:24] that comes when god settles in your
[1:32:26] heart
[1:32:28] romans 8
[1:32:29] 18 and 19
[1:32:32] paul is saying this for i reckon that
[1:32:33] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:32:36] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:32:38] which shall reveal be revealed in us
[1:32:41] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:32:43] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:32:46] of the sons of god
[1:32:52] i i just it it's it's
[1:32:55] for another way to say for the anxious
[1:32:58] looking out
[1:32:59] an anxious a desire a drive
[1:33:03] the trees the plants
[1:33:07] the the atmosphere
[1:33:09] used to be pure
[1:33:11] no sin involved no nothing
[1:33:14] it was natural it was healthy
[1:33:17] look what has happened here in the last
[1:33:18] month with all the rain that has hit
[1:33:20] southern arizona
[1:33:22] doesn't even look much like a desert in
[1:33:23] some places
[1:33:25] brother branham made it made a comment
[1:33:27] he said
[1:33:28] when the water gets to it those those
[1:33:30] cactus thorns will turn into blooms
[1:33:34] watch what begins to happen
[1:33:36] when the things that should be happening
[1:33:38] are there
[1:33:39] there's a change about it
[1:33:42] the the wolf and it shall lay with the
[1:33:44] lamb and the bear you know because that
[1:33:47] was in the beginning
[1:33:50] but it's changed
[1:33:51] but they're waiting for the
[1:33:53] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:33:57] that's me and you
[1:33:59] wait until we come into that place
[1:34:03] and i'm under that expectation that soon
[1:34:06] and very soon
[1:34:08] i was talking to a brother the other day
[1:34:10] and i asked him a question
[1:34:13] and he said brother aaron i think it's
[1:34:15] so close
[1:34:16] i think it's very close i just can't see
[1:34:20] uh that being i'm talking close i'm not
[1:34:23] talking about two years from i'm talking
[1:34:24] close
[1:34:25] we'll be going home it's just falling
[1:34:27] apart so fast it's just things are
[1:34:29] happening so quick you know
[1:34:32] and my answer to him was
[1:34:34] lift up your head your redemption
[1:34:36] draweth nigh and he says oh i hope
[1:34:38] you're being so prophetic it's going to
[1:34:39] be tomorrow
[1:34:41] let that be our expectation
[1:34:43] let that be our desire lord that it
[1:34:45] would be
[1:34:46] now
[1:34:48] but until then my heart will go on
[1:34:50] singing but until then with joy i'll
[1:34:52] carry on
[1:34:55] this world is not my home i'm just a
[1:34:57] passing through
[1:34:58] but while i'm in passing through here
[1:35:00] let me be a christian
[1:35:01] let me be a light
[1:35:03] let me be example let there be enough
[1:35:05] that i would want to reach out to one
[1:35:07] more say come go with me
[1:35:10] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:35:13] waiteth for the manifestations of the
[1:35:15] sons of god i think brother branham said
[1:35:17] many times
[1:35:18] we should be further along down the road
[1:35:21] but god knows why
[1:35:24] second corinthians
[1:35:25] 4
[1:35:26] 7.
[1:35:30] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:35:32] vessels
[1:35:34] that's you and me
[1:35:36] you have this treasure in your vessel
[1:35:40] that the excellency of the power of may
[1:35:42] be of god and not of us
[1:35:45] because no one in their earth and vessel
[1:35:47] has been able to produce this
[1:35:52] you have a mother teresa and thank god
[1:35:54] for people like them who've done all
[1:35:56] they could to help
[1:35:58] i'm surely not opposed anybody doing
[1:36:00] some good to help somebody
[1:36:03] but when you do that good thinking
[1:36:04] you're going to merit heaven you've
[1:36:06] missed the reason why
[1:36:09] you do that good because the good god
[1:36:11] lives in you
[1:36:12] and you're sharing him
[1:36:14] see we have this treasure in earthen
[1:36:16] vessels that the excellency of the power
[1:36:19] may be of god and not of us
[1:36:22] he said
[1:36:23] we have the wealth of vessels in the
[1:36:25] vessels of earth so that it may be seen
[1:36:28] that the power comes from god not from
[1:36:30] us but from god
[1:36:33] you're too human to be able to do that
[1:36:35] they're going to say no it's the god
[1:36:36] that lives in me
[1:36:39] ephesians
[1:36:43] chapter 3 or verses 9 to 12.
[1:36:48] and to make all men see what is a
[1:36:50] fellowship of the mystery paul is
[1:36:52] speaking the unveiling of god
[1:36:55] in this day what used to be the law if
[1:36:57] you go back and see where ephesians what
[1:36:59] used to be all the law and all the way
[1:37:01] that god brought it but he said today
[1:37:03] god has unveiled this mystery and the
[1:37:05] fellowship we have in this unveiling of
[1:37:08] god
[1:37:09] he says which from the beginning of the
[1:37:11] world has been hid in god
[1:37:14] who created all things by jesus christ
[1:37:16] he's explaining in the unveiling jesus
[1:37:19] christ becomes here and begins to unveil
[1:37:22] god before us
[1:37:24] it's god walking in flesh
[1:37:26] it's god he said i and my father are one
[1:37:29] brother peter spoke um here wednesday
[1:37:32] night the true place of worship
[1:37:35] god's chosen place of worship and if you
[1:37:37] read it
[1:37:38] over time as brother brahms speaking on
[1:37:40] those things and you get there to the
[1:37:42] end and he begins to put it out plainly
[1:37:44] there is only one place
[1:37:48] it's not varied you can't have a little
[1:37:50] bit there a little bit it is or it isn't
[1:37:54] well god accepts because it had to come
[1:37:57] through the sacrifice
[1:38:00] and until he said this is my son in who
[1:38:04] i am well please until he said it is
[1:38:06] accepted
[1:38:09] and then you and i can come in through
[1:38:11] that
[1:38:13] if you go read that one in 65 he said if
[1:38:15] you're coming in any other name
[1:38:18] your worship is not being accepted to
[1:38:21] god
[1:38:22] and i don't know if you've done this but
[1:38:24] i have i've gone on youtube and looked
[1:38:26] at what people call worship today and
[1:38:28] i have a cousin
[1:38:32] her mother is my mom's sister and her
[1:38:35] dad is my father's brother and she's
[1:38:38] quite a little preacher
[1:38:41] oh they won't use the word as a preacher
[1:38:43] they'll go all the way around it but
[1:38:45] she's preaching the services
[1:38:47] but because she says she's not a
[1:38:48] preacher i guess it makes it right
[1:38:51] and i watch them and i listen because
[1:38:54] sometimes they'll say
[1:38:55] it was really good listen to this and i
[1:38:56] can last about five minutes of it and
[1:38:59] i can't take it anymore
[1:39:01] it and just to watch what they call
[1:39:04] worship
[1:39:05] what they call giving god honor and
[1:39:07] glory
[1:39:09] it's not there
[1:39:11] it's it's it's exalting themselves
[1:39:14] it's
[1:39:16] in one moment they're they're talking
[1:39:17] about jesus in the next moment they're
[1:39:19] lifting up what they're doing they're
[1:39:21] talking about how the bishop of the
[1:39:23] church
[1:39:24] is here and one of the brothers they
[1:39:26] believe in speaking tongues is the
[1:39:27] evidence of the holy ghost so the bishop
[1:39:29] got up and for the next 10 minutes 15
[1:39:31] minutes he had them stammering and
[1:39:32] stammering just trying to get him to
[1:39:34] speak speak in tongues
[1:39:36] that's not god
[1:39:39] that's another man another church's way
[1:39:40] of worship
[1:39:42] not acceptable unto god because it's not
[1:39:44] coming through the proper way
[1:39:48] there is a way to approach god
[1:39:50] an accepted way
[1:39:53] and he says it's been unveiled
[1:39:57] it's been the veil was rent into from
[1:40:00] top to bottom
[1:40:02] they tried to sow it back up
[1:40:05] to keep him bound in that religion but
[1:40:07] god said no the way has been made
[1:40:10] to the intent that now unto the unto the
[1:40:12] principalities and power in heavenly
[1:40:14] places might be known by the church the
[1:40:17] manifold wisdom of god
[1:40:19] how god chose to do it it's perfect
[1:40:24] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:40:26] he purposed in christ jesus our lord
[1:40:29] in whom we have boldness and access with
[1:40:32] confidence by the faith of him
[1:40:36] not in my works
[1:40:38] not in my abilities
[1:40:40] i should kneel down and pray but if i
[1:40:42] think god owes me an answer because i
[1:40:44] knelt down to pray i'm missing it
[1:40:47] god i'm going to pray for 30 days and
[1:40:49] you better have an answer for me on the
[1:40:51] end of that day
[1:40:52] that's not how we lord i'm going to get
[1:40:54] on my my knees and kneel down before you
[1:40:57] and i'm going to ask you
[1:40:59] lord be merciful to me and i'll wait on
[1:41:01] you
[1:41:02] i'll worship you i'll praise you i'll
[1:41:05] give you honor i'll give you glory
[1:41:08] obama wait on your answer
[1:41:11] now what it what did what do you tell
[1:41:13] daniel god heard your prayer
[1:41:16] god heard your prayer from day one
[1:41:19] but i was withstood
[1:41:22] he said because there satan's doing
[1:41:24] everything he can to make sure god that
[1:41:25] answer does it from god doesn't get to
[1:41:27] you
[1:41:28] but it's going to get to you
[1:41:30] because god's going to get it there and
[1:41:31] he has his reasons why
[1:41:39] and then we go to colossians
[1:41:42] wherever i am made a minister paul says
[1:41:44] according to the dispensation of god
[1:41:46] which is given to me for you
[1:41:49] it was not for paul it was for us
[1:41:51] to fulfill the word of god
[1:41:53] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:41:56] ages and generations
[1:41:58] but now is made manifest to a saints
[1:42:01] at a time
[1:42:03] you know it was not
[1:42:04] but god said in this day i'm going to
[1:42:06] open it up
[1:42:08] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:42:10] riches
[1:42:11] of this mystery among the gentiles which
[1:42:13] is christ in you
[1:42:16] the hope of glory
[1:42:19] not christ and the prophet
[1:42:20] not christ in the preacher not christ
[1:42:23] just in this church or this group or
[1:42:24] this tangent christ in you
[1:42:27] so that wherever you are god is
[1:42:31] you ever realize that
[1:42:33] christ in you brother matt god is there
[1:42:37] he said oh got to be careful no
[1:42:39] understand
[1:42:41] god goes with you it's christ in you
[1:42:43] the hope of glory how do i know because
[1:42:46] his word says so and his word never
[1:42:48] fails
[1:42:50] and as you begin to surrender and yield
[1:42:52] and let god you begin to see it's him
[1:42:58] he manifests himself through his word
[1:43:00] and he brings things to pass
[1:43:04] god's word says so so therefore it
[1:43:06] happens brother branham says i'm just
[1:43:08] waiting on him i'm helpless without him
[1:43:12] although brother branham had done it
[1:43:14] thousands of times already you would
[1:43:16] have thought okay i know how to work
[1:43:18] this now no he would take the word of
[1:43:20] god and he would minister the word god
[1:43:22] and then he would wait on the angel of
[1:43:24] the lord to come
[1:43:26] but once the angel of the lord was there
[1:43:28] he says okay he's here now
[1:43:32] and everything now was under my control
[1:43:35] who was speaking in brother brahm the
[1:43:36] man no the the one that realized that's
[1:43:39] god
[1:43:41] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:43:43] forever
[1:43:44] you stand over a situation he said i'll
[1:43:46] be with you even in you and you can
[1:43:48] stand and say i take everything under my
[1:43:49] control
[1:43:51] why because he's there with you
[1:43:53] that's not you speaking that's god
[1:43:55] saying i'm in charge here i've got in my
[1:43:57] hand
[1:44:00] brother that was for the prophet only
[1:44:03] don't let satan get to that he's done
[1:44:05] that for so long that was for brother
[1:44:07] and money that was for the brother green
[1:44:09] only that was for that brother because
[1:44:11] he's good and you're being robbed of
[1:44:13] your blessings
[1:44:15] it's christ in you
[1:44:17] the hope of glory you better put your or
[1:44:19] in there
[1:44:20] maybe maybe write it right there right
[1:44:23] under there so when you read it it'll
[1:44:24] remind you
[1:44:25] it's christ and eddie the hope of glory
[1:44:29] it's christ in amanda the hope of glory
[1:44:32] it's each one of us
[1:44:36] is this
[1:44:40] it's it's
[1:44:42] when you get god you get everything
[1:44:45] he's all in all
[1:44:47] he's
[1:44:48] there's no limit to him
[1:44:50] there's there there's no resources that
[1:44:52] he can't tap into there is in the first
[1:44:56] i own the cattle in a thousand hills he
[1:44:58] said
[1:45:00] so what what could you say well he's not
[1:45:02] capable of doing
[1:45:06] in first peter
[1:45:09] 1
[1:45:10] 3 and 4
[1:45:13] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:45:15] lord jesus christ which according to his
[1:45:17] abundant mercy
[1:45:19] has begotten us again unto a lively hope
[1:45:22] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[1:45:25] the dead
[1:45:26] take a couple of minutes right now and
[1:45:29] think a bit about had you been there and
[1:45:31] watched him die
[1:45:34] and you had been one of those that had
[1:45:36] walked with him three and a half years
[1:45:38] and watched
[1:45:40] from day one when he called you by name
[1:45:43] told you who you were
[1:45:44] unveiled the secrets of your heart and
[1:45:46] began to land you had to realize this is
[1:45:48] god
[1:45:50] and you watch things like feeding five
[1:45:52] thousand with
[1:45:54] three loaves of bread and two fish
[1:45:56] telling peter go over and take the gold
[1:45:58] out of the mouth of that fish and go pay
[1:45:59] the taxes
[1:46:01] take another one of it says rise up
[1:46:02] daughter and life is given back call out
[1:46:05] lazarus come forth and he did
[1:46:08] you you got to the point where
[1:46:10] what is impossible for god nothing
[1:46:16] but peter realized i said by his
[1:46:18] resurrection
[1:46:20] from the dead
[1:46:22] we have this hope
[1:46:25] not just the scene and the watching of
[1:46:27] the three and a half years but because
[1:46:29] he resurrected from the dead it makes it
[1:46:32] all real and true
[1:46:35] because had he not
[1:46:37] that it would have said he's just
[1:46:40] another
[1:46:41] man that god used
[1:46:44] there are many
[1:46:46] that would go now they still do on
[1:46:47] easter
[1:46:49] and wait there at the temple or the the
[1:46:51] tomb of brother branham where he's
[1:46:53] buried and they wait for his
[1:46:54] resurrection there
[1:46:57] talked to different folks who said they
[1:46:58] were there they seen it people come
[1:47:00] waiting for brother branham to resurrect
[1:47:04] he's coming up in the general
[1:47:05] resurrection of all the saints
[1:47:08] but the one that needed to resurrect
[1:47:11] already did
[1:47:14] he's the one
[1:47:16] and that's what peter says here to an
[1:47:18] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled
[1:47:22] and that fadeth not away reserved in
[1:47:24] heaven for you
[1:47:27] because he lives
[1:47:29] i can face tomorrow
[1:47:31] i'm not a fear afraid of there's no fear
[1:47:34] in it peter says of all the people peter
[1:47:38] the one who denied him
[1:47:40] the one who said i'll go with you
[1:47:43] let me come across and he he's he was uh
[1:47:48] boisterous enough bold enough to say
[1:47:49] those things maybe some of the other
[1:47:51] ones wanted to but they didn't but peter
[1:47:53] did
[1:47:54] let me come up if that's you lord let me
[1:47:56] walk on the water and the lord says come
[1:47:57] on peter
[1:47:59] do you think the lord didn't know what
[1:48:01] peter was going to do of course he knew
[1:48:03] but he still invited him he didn't say
[1:48:05] no peter don't you dare you're gonna
[1:48:06] drown
[1:48:09] okay
[1:48:10] now
[1:48:11] understand peter you know
[1:48:14] you're gonna deny me three times
[1:48:17] no way lord there is no i've seen too
[1:48:20] much of you i've had too many
[1:48:21] experiences with there is no way i'm
[1:48:22] going to deny you peter's saying
[1:48:25] he said you're going to hear that
[1:48:27] rooster crow after he denied me the
[1:48:29] third time
[1:48:31] and it says peter's heart just broke
[1:48:33] apart when that rooster crowed
[1:48:36] peter says let's go back to fishing as
[1:48:38] one brother said they went back to
[1:48:40] fishing and couldn't even remember how
[1:48:42] to fish god had to tell them where the
[1:48:43] fish were
[1:48:46] you ever thought about that i thought
[1:48:48] that was interesting
[1:48:49] peter had done it all his life but
[1:48:51] they're fishing they can't catch
[1:48:52] anything god said cast it on the other
[1:48:53] side peter
[1:48:55] you still need me peter no matter what
[1:48:59] i'm so glad that
[1:49:00] he reached down his hand for me
[1:49:05] and then to finish
[1:49:07] in ephesians
[1:49:08] the musicians want to
[1:49:10] make their way up

[1:49:13] play the organ you know
[1:49:15] i'll finish here
[1:49:18] ephesians now unto him that is able to
[1:49:20] do exceeding abundantly above all that
[1:49:23] we ask or think
[1:49:25] according to the power that worketh in
[1:49:28] us
[1:49:29] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:49:33] to do above and beyond anything you
[1:49:36] could ima ask of him
[1:49:39] and he says unto him be glory
[1:49:42] in the church by christ jesus through
[1:49:44] all ages
[1:49:45] world without end
[1:49:48] and he said
[1:49:49] amen
[1:49:50] so
[1:49:51] beat
[1:49:53] that settles it
[1:49:55] god's word never fails

[1:57:38] having somebody have confidence and
[1:57:41] somebody you can go to
[1:57:44] i know that after brother green's
[1:57:46] passing and things we began to go
[1:57:48] through
[1:57:49] some good friends
[1:57:51] brothers that we got to know
[1:57:54] brother ray erickson
[1:57:55] brother jim ed dalton
[1:57:58] brother robert figaro brothers that had
[1:58:00] more experience than myself
[1:58:04] in this that said hey brother aaron if
[1:58:06] we can help you we'll help you
[1:58:08] and it was good
[1:58:09] it was good to be able to share
[1:58:11] something or pass something along what
[1:58:13] would you do in this situation have you
[1:58:15] dealt with this before
[1:58:17] and sometimes they left and they weren't
[1:58:20] laughing at me they were just laughing
[1:58:21] because they realized
[1:58:24] brother ray asked me one day so so what
[1:58:27] does a pastor need to know what does
[1:58:30] what is it
[1:58:31] oh i said he understands everything he
[1:58:34] has an answer for it all
[1:58:35] he can solve everybody's problems he
[1:58:37] never gets frustrated he's on top of it
[1:58:40] all
[1:58:40] and brother ray started laughing
[1:58:43] i said i know you're laughing i know why
[1:58:44] you're laughing because i know what i'm
[1:58:45] saying is but that's just what i think i
[1:58:47] should be able to do to help the people
[1:58:50] but it's god that helps the people
[1:58:53] what we each one of us have to do is
[1:58:54] yield and surrender
[1:58:56] father of the home
[1:58:59] mother of the home
[1:59:01] say lord help me with my children
[1:59:03] teenagers young people saying lord help
[1:59:05] me as part of the family god knows he
[1:59:08] went through all of it
[1:59:10] believe it or not he was a teenager
[1:59:14] that's how he can understand because he
[1:59:16] went through it
[1:59:17] yeah i was a teenager a long time ago
[1:59:19] and i realized it was different in my
[1:59:21] life than what someone go through
[1:59:23] but we went through it but he went
[1:59:25] through it purposely so that when you
[1:59:27] and i talk to him he says i understand.
[1:59:30] this is how we go through
[1:59:31] and i appreciate the god of mercy and
[1:59:33] the god of grace for all of us
