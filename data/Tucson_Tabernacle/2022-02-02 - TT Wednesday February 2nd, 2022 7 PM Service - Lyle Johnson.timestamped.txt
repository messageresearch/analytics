[40:08] amen
[40:12] before we're seated
[40:14] please open your bible to the gospel of
[40:16] mark i don't see mark i see jenny god
[40:18] bless you jenny but mark's not here
[40:20] we'll read a short but very familiar
[40:22] passage from the 12th chapter
[40:25] beginning at the 28th verse in fact it's
[40:28] one we read together only a short time
[40:30] ago
[40:32] the context
[40:33] is jesus in the temple
[40:36] during his final week we often call this
[40:38] the passion week
[40:40] it's after palm sunday before the sham
[40:43] trial and cruel death
[40:45] he had just silenced the sadducees
[40:48] and the pharisees
[40:50] masters of the jewish faith
[40:52] as well as the herodians
[40:54] political people of the ruling power
[40:57] but there was an insightful observer
[41:00] nearby
[41:01] who came
[41:03] and spoke up
[41:09] we read and one of the scribes perhaps
[41:12] he was just a record keeper or one who
[41:14] copied the scriptures maybe he was a
[41:16] minor official
[41:17] maybe a recent graduate of a prominent
[41:20] yeshiva a place where they study the
[41:22] bible but he came
[41:24] and having heard jesus
[41:26] and the officials
[41:28] and the high-ranking priests who had
[41:29] been challenging him
[41:31] reasoning together
[41:33] and and describe perhaps he was a young
[41:35] man perceiving that jesus had answered
[41:38] his challengers well
[41:40] asked jesus
[41:42] that's always a good idea
[41:44] go right to the source
[41:47] which is the first commandment of all
[41:51] and and jesus who may have been a little
[41:53] bit suspicious he's just been going
[41:55] through this interrogation by these
[41:57] other guys and here's another person
[41:59] coming up and asking a question maybe
[42:02] it's another attempt to twist his words
[42:04] or trap him a little bit we we see a
[42:06] couple of verses later that
[42:09] why this may have been
[42:11] so probably turning to face this person
[42:13] nonetheless and it gives them a very
[42:15] honest straightforward answer as jesus
[42:17] always does
[42:19] he says the first
[42:21] the commandment of primary importance
[42:24] is hear
[42:26] o israel
[42:27] the lord
[42:28] our god is one lord
[42:32] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[42:35] to what extent
[42:37] with all thy heart
[42:39] with all thy soul
[42:41] with all thy
[42:42] mind with all thy strength
[42:46] this
[42:47] is the first commandment
[42:49] have you ever noticed that this primary
[42:53] commandment isn't part of the ten
[42:54] commandments
[42:56] ten commandments are in exodus 20 in
[42:58] deuteronomy 5 but this is from
[43:00] deuteronomy 6.
[43:03] and then jesus asked he added this he
[43:06] wasn't asked
[43:08] it's not part of the ten it's found in
[43:10] leviticus
[43:11] 19
[43:12] but he added this he pointed it out the
[43:14] second is like
[43:16] namely this
[43:18] thou shalt love thy neighbor
[43:21] as thyself
[43:24] as
[43:25] thyself there's none other commandment
[43:27] greater than these
[43:29] matthew's account of this conversation
[43:31] jesus says on these two commandments
[43:34] hang all
[43:36] the law
[43:37] and the
[43:38] prophets
[43:40] and the scribes said to him
[43:42] well master
[43:45] teacher rabbi
[43:47] you've said the truth
[43:49] there is one god
[43:50] there's none other but he
[43:53] and to love him
[43:54] with all the heart
[43:56] with all the understanding with all the
[43:59] soul
[44:00] with all the strength and to love his
[44:02] neighbor as himself now notice they're
[44:04] standing in the courtyard of the temple
[44:07] they're on the temple grounds the altar
[44:09] of sacrifice is no doubt visible from
[44:12] where they're standing and and and this
[44:14] young man probably just gestured toward
[44:17] it
[44:18] as he makes the rest of his statement
[44:20] here
[44:21] more than all whole burnt offerings and
[44:23] sacrifices
[44:26] and when jesus saw that he answered
[44:28] discreetly
[44:30] wisely intelligently with understanding
[44:34] jesus saw this wasn't an attempt to trap
[44:36] or to twist
[44:38] it was a genuine question
[44:40] it was from a sincere heart
[44:42] he said to describe thou art not far
[44:46] from the kingdom of god
[44:49] and no man after that dare to ask him
[44:52] any questions
[44:54] please be seated
[44:57] the passes we just read is
[44:59] one that we've read often
[45:02] we're all familiar with the parable that
[45:04] we call the good samaritan
[45:06] which was jesus shocking answer to the
[45:09] question
[45:10] who's my neighbor
[45:12] a couple of weeks ago i shared with you
[45:13] a brief testimony about a question i had
[45:15] in the message regarding the angel that
[45:18] launched brother branham's ministry and
[45:20] how he tied it to the birth of the
[45:22] modern state of israel another question
[45:25] had been on my heart and my mind
[45:27] for a long time
[45:29] the answer was right in front of me in
[45:32] fact i'd heard it i even knew it
[45:35] but i hadn't recognized it as the answer
[45:38] until very recently and that's tonight's
[45:41] topic it's what i want to share with you
[45:44] please open your bibles to the gospel of
[45:46] saint john
[45:48] we'll read briefly from the 13th and the
[45:51] 15th chapters
[45:53] scriptures so familiar to most of us
[45:55] here that they're written in indelible
[45:57] ink on our hearts
[46:02] john 13
[46:04] verse 34 we read
[46:06] jesus speaking a new commandment i give
[46:09] unto you
[46:12] we've got 613 do we need another one a
[46:15] new commandment i give unto you that you
[46:17] love one another
[46:20] as i have loved you
[46:22] that ye also love
[46:24] one another
[46:27] by this
[46:29] shall all men know
[46:32] shall all men know
[46:34] that you're my disciples
[46:37] if you have love one to another
[46:40] tonight i want to speak about the nature
[46:42] of that love that we're to have
[46:45] how it identifies us
[46:47] when heather and i moved back to tucson
[46:49] from washington in december of 2012 i i
[46:53] had a lingering question about this very
[46:55] passage
[46:56] i asked brother greene and others
[46:59] somehow i didn't register the answer
[47:03] and messages were brother branham
[47:05] references this verse there are
[47:06] approximately ten
[47:07] he often speaks of love compassion
[47:11] breaking down walls
[47:14] helping a fallen brother drawing his
[47:16] circle of fellowship larger
[47:18] to encompass his critics
[47:20] putting out your hand in your heart to
[47:22] others
[47:23] who disagree
[47:25] he used denominational barriers to
[47:27] illustrate the walls that separate
[47:30] and it's all true
[47:32] and it's all applicable and we need to
[47:34] do those things
[47:36] but my question was
[47:38] what is the nature what is the
[47:40] expression
[47:42] of that love that will mark us to all
[47:44] men
[47:45] as christians
[47:47] put another way what's different
[47:50] about the love we should have for each
[47:51] other that almost anyone who observes us
[47:55] will recognize
[47:56] that we are jesus disciples his students
[48:00] his apprentices what brother branham
[48:02] once called messiah ets
[48:05] little messiahs
[48:07] in john 15 12 we read
[48:10] this is my commandment
[48:12] that you love one another as i have
[48:15] loved you
[48:17] and he goes on he says greater love has
[48:19] no man than this
[48:21] than a man lay down his life for his
[48:23] friends
[48:25] now in my mind i'd always separated
[48:28] these two verses
[48:29] where to love is jesus loved but but his
[48:32] sacrifice laying down his life was
[48:35] all-encompassing
[48:36] we're not going to die on a cross to
[48:38] take away the sin of the world
[48:40] we're not that perfect sacrifice
[48:43] that's an act that can inspire us and
[48:45] for which we are eternally grateful but
[48:48] that was something for him to do
[48:50] and him alone
[48:52] he laid down his life for us
[48:54] not while we were even his friends while
[48:56] we were yet in sin
[48:58] his enemies
[49:00] we were part of that crowd
[49:02] that screamed crucify him
[49:06] we
[49:07] i
[49:08] drove the spikes in his outstretched
[49:10] limbs
[49:11] and even in that ultimate agony he
[49:14] screamed out father forgive them
[49:16] they don't know what they're doing
[49:20] why did he do this
[49:24] that we might be the children of god
[49:27] think about that for a moment jesus
[49:31] is our brother
[49:34] let's read from first john the third
[49:36] chapter
[49:38] you might want to leave a mark on your
[49:39] bible because we'll be going back to
[49:41] this one
[49:42] again tonight
[49:45] starting at verse 1
[49:47] we read behold
[49:50] what manner
[49:51] what type
[49:53] behold the nature
[49:54] of the love of the father the father is
[49:58] the expression of god's office of
[50:00] highest authority
[50:03] the love the father has bestowed upon
[50:06] has given
[50:07] to us
[50:08] that we should be called the sons
[50:12] the children
[50:13] the offspring
[50:16] think of that
[50:17] the very children
[50:19] of god
[50:24] therefore
[50:30] i'm sorry
[50:32] we should be calm
[50:36] i clicked it one too many times excuse
[50:39] me
[50:41] therefore the world knoweth us not
[50:43] because it knew him not
[50:45] beloved
[50:46] now are we the sons of god
[50:48] when
[50:50] we don't have to wait for this
[50:52] relationship it is our relationship at
[50:56] this very moment
[50:58] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[51:00] but but we know that when he shall
[51:03] appear we shall be like him
[51:05] for we'll see him
[51:07] as he is
[51:08] paul mentions this last part in his
[51:10] second letter to the corinthians 2
[51:12] corinthians 3 18 we read
[51:14] but we all with open face beholding as
[51:17] in a glass that's a mirror
[51:20] we see only a reflection of the glory of
[51:23] the lord
[51:24] and are changed into the same image the
[51:26] same likeness
[51:28] from glory to glory
[51:30] even as by the spirit of the lord
[51:34] god's children
[51:37] children
[51:39] i want to digress here for just a moment
[51:41] let's jump to the year 1996
[51:45] and we'll go across the atlantic ocean
[51:48] an amazing thing happened
[51:50] in england that year
[51:53] some scientists took a cell
[51:56] from an adult you a female sheep it
[51:59] wasn't an egg it wasn't a stem cell it
[52:02] was
[52:03] just a cell
[52:04] they extracted the nucleus of the cell
[52:07] and from it they created a cell that was
[52:09] implanted in the uterus of another
[52:10] female sheep
[52:12] this cell divided and grew
[52:15] and after the allotted time that you
[52:18] gave birth to a lamb
[52:20] from that cell
[52:22] they named that lamb dolly
[52:26] she was a clone
[52:28] genetically identical
[52:31] to the sheep from which the cell was
[52:33] taken if she had fingerprints her
[52:35] fingerprints would match that in the
[52:37] adult sheet that donated the cell
[52:40] not an egg not a stem cell
[52:43] just a cell
[52:45] well dolly got sick and died a few years
[52:47] later and there was speculation that
[52:48] well she died early because she was a
[52:49] clone and and and that cell was old and
[52:52] so therefore she was born old and so
[52:54] forth so so they cloned dolly again
[52:57] but this time they made four sheep
[53:01] that's daisy
[53:02] debbie
[53:03] denise and diana
[53:06] there won't be a test
[53:08] they lived the normal lifespan of sheep
[53:10] they got along just fine because they
[53:12] weren't just siblings
[53:14] they were copies
[53:16] they had slightly different outcomes one
[53:18] got injured and so forth
[53:20] because
[53:21] we do not have a predetermined outcome
[53:24] based solely on our genetics
[53:26] or our dna we're also a product of an
[53:29] influence by our life experiences isn't
[53:32] that part of the reason we're here
[53:34] to develop character
[53:37] through our experiences
[53:40] god doesn't want clones
[53:42] doesn't want to stamp out on an assembly
[53:44] line mindless robots
[53:47] or identical people
[53:49] when you've seen one you've seen them
[53:50] all does not apply to humans
[53:53] he wants children
[53:55] that's his desire
[53:57] that's his will
[54:00] and children though from the same
[54:02] parents are different
[54:04] each is unique
[54:06] here's a rather poor photo of myself and
[54:08] my two brothers taken in the early days
[54:10] of photography yeah they had invented
[54:12] photography before i was born believe it
[54:14] or not this picture was taken on 1954-55
[54:18] paul my oldest brother
[54:20] is there on the right
[54:22] noel
[54:24] is on the left
[54:25] noah was bigger than me at one point
[54:28] that cute little kid in the middle
[54:31] and yes my mother made the shirts
[54:34] you can see that the three of us are
[54:36] quite different you've seen me here with
[54:39] my brother noel
[54:40] we're recognizable as brothers have many
[54:43] similarities
[54:44] but we're very different
[54:46] in appearance
[54:47] and in other ways
[54:53] god loves diversity
[54:58] i may sound like a politician but that's
[54:59] not what i'm driving at i'm i'm not
[55:01] focusing on our differences
[55:04] only noting that we are all different
[55:07] our planet teems with myriad species and
[55:10] variations
[55:11] it's by design
[55:14] it's for a reason
[55:17] in 1957 and the message i will restore
[55:20] brother branham mentions this just sort
[55:22] of in passing he says you know
[55:24] there's none of us just alike
[55:26] if we should all go up this morning and
[55:28] they give us fingerprint we find out
[55:30] there's no two fingerprints exactly
[55:31] alike
[55:33] that's known they claim there's no to
[55:34] people god knows is just exactly alike
[55:37] be grateful
[55:40] we're so different one to another and
[55:42] many make up but we can certainly agree
[55:44] that we're all humans
[55:47] and in our religious beliefs we find the
[55:49] same thing
[55:50] we might not believe on every principle
[55:53] but we believe on christ
[55:56] and that's the main thing
[55:59] regardless of those differences that
[56:01] diversity
[56:03] what has god made us
[56:05] as children
[56:07] what has he called us to
[56:09] unity
[56:11] not uniformity
[56:13] but unity
[56:15] different
[56:17] but with a common aim and goal force is
[56:19] us to resolve our differences
[56:21] find common ground
[56:23] grow
[56:25] develop character
[56:27] those four sheep clones got along fine
[56:30] they're clones
[56:32] they're the same
[56:34] paul talks about this ephesians the
[56:36] fourth chapter verse 1 we read i
[56:39] therefore the prisoner of christ beseech
[56:43] implore
[56:45] appeal to i urge you
[56:48] that you walk worthy of the vocation
[56:51] what what is your vocation it's not your
[56:53] hobby that's what you do for a living
[56:55] your work your calling wherewith ye are
[56:58] called with all lowliness and meekness
[57:01] long suffering for bearing one another
[57:03] in love
[57:04] humility gentleness
[57:06] unselfishness
[57:08] deference
[57:10] patience endeavoring
[57:13] making every effort
[57:15] diligently persevering to keep the
[57:18] the what
[57:20] unity
[57:21] of the spirit
[57:23] and the bond of peace
[57:25] i'd like to show you a little
[57:26] illustration here
[57:29] the story behind this picture
[57:32] is that when this father's kid started
[57:33] fighting he didn't join in
[57:36] he just got out the big shirt
[57:39] the kids knew what that meant they'd
[57:40] both have to wear it
[57:42] until the fighting stopped
[57:45] and it worked
[57:46] because the big shirt
[57:48] taught you that harmony with others
[57:51] is always in your own best interest
[57:55] just like harmony within ourselves we
[57:57] must pull ourselves together
[57:59] or we'll rip ourselves apart
[58:02] i wonder
[58:03] if the upper room
[58:05] during the 10 days between the ascension
[58:07] and the day of pentecost
[58:09] wasn't a big shirt experience
[58:12] we read in acts 2 1 that they were all
[58:14] with one accord in one place
[58:17] then
[58:18] the holy spirit came
[58:20] the spirit didn't bring unity unity
[58:23] brought the spirit
[58:26] i recall a meeting that i attended in
[58:28] washington dc about 40 years ago i was
[58:31] 32 years of age
[58:33] i was part of an international
[58:35] all-volunteer group called amsat that
[58:38] that designed built and arranged for the
[58:40] launch of satellites for use in amateur
[58:42] radio
[58:44] we were preparing to launch our most
[58:45] ambitious spacecraft ever
[58:48] another volunteer group which i was a
[58:50] president wanted to do some
[58:52] groundbreaking experiments with digital
[58:54] communications computer networking if
[58:56] you will
[58:57] using this spacecraft
[59:00] in order to succeed
[59:02] we had to come to agreement on some
[59:04] specific ways in which we could enable
[59:06] these communications through a satellite
[59:08] that at times could see half the planet
[59:12] and there were strong proponents of
[59:14] differing incompatible approaches to
[59:17] accomplish this goal
[59:19] think of it as a kind of a tower of
[59:21] babel problem
[59:22] we had to speak the same language encode
[59:25] the data in an agreed way
[59:27] it quickly gets pretty technical i won't
[59:29] bore you with the details but the
[59:31] president of amsat saw that this problem
[59:34] had to be solved
[59:37] so he solved it with the big shirt
[59:40] he put us all
[59:41] everybody that wanted to
[59:43] develop and participate in these
[59:45] experiments we all went into a room with
[59:48] him he locked the door
[59:50] he held up the key
[59:52] he said no one leaves until we all agree
[59:57] it worked
[59:59] so did the experiments
[1:00:01] getting back to paul
[1:00:03] he says endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:00:05] the spirit
[1:00:07] in the bond of peace
[1:00:09] he says there's one body one spirit
[1:00:12] you're all called in one hope of your
[1:00:14] calling one lord one faith one baptism
[1:00:18] one god and father of us all who is
[1:00:20] above all and through all and in you all
[1:00:23] but unto every one of us
[1:00:26] is given grace
[1:00:28] according to the measure
[1:00:30] of the gift of christ
[1:00:32] skipping down to verse 11
[1:00:34] we read he gave some apostles some
[1:00:37] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[1:00:41] teachers
[1:00:42] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:00:45] that's a plural that's us
[1:00:48] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:00:50] edifying of the body
[1:00:51] that's one of christ
[1:00:54] the body of christ that's also us
[1:00:58] till we come to the unity
[1:01:01] of the faith of the knowledge of the son
[1:01:03] of god unto a perfect man unto the
[1:01:05] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:01:08] of christ that we henceforth be no more
[1:01:10] children
[1:01:12] toddlers without understanding
[1:01:14] tossed to and fro
[1:01:16] carried about with every wind of
[1:01:18] doctrine by the slight of men and
[1:01:20] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[1:01:22] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[1:01:25] in love may grow up into him becoming
[1:01:29] adult offspring
[1:01:31] in all things which is the head
[1:01:34] even christ
[1:01:36] from which the whole body
[1:01:38] fitly joined together and compacted that
[1:01:40] by which every joint supplieth
[1:01:43] according to the effectual working in
[1:01:45] the measure of every part
[1:01:48] maketh increase of the body and to the
[1:01:50] edifying of itself
[1:01:53] in love
[1:01:55] so we see
[1:01:57] we're all different
[1:01:59] we have different purposes
[1:02:01] different functions within the one body
[1:02:06] one is not more important or less
[1:02:08] important than another
[1:02:11] all have a role
[1:02:13] each
[1:02:14] is necessary
[1:02:17] all right but what about that love
[1:02:18] brother lyle oh
[1:02:20] thank you let's get back on track here
[1:02:22] john wrote his three epistles his
[1:02:25] letters
[1:02:27] after his patmos exile
[1:02:31] after
[1:02:32] the book of revelation of jesus christ
[1:02:35] after he witnessed the life of christ
[1:02:39] after he was present on the mount of
[1:02:42] transfiguration
[1:02:44] after walking with jesus for the
[1:02:46] duration of his ministry
[1:02:48] after he witnessed the resurrection of
[1:02:50] jesus and the outpouring of the spirit
[1:02:52] of pentecost
[1:02:54] these are among john's last words to the
[1:02:57] church
[1:02:58] after all those
[1:03:01] they express his final
[1:03:04] overriding concern he's sharing and
[1:03:06] teaching his last lesson
[1:03:09] back to first john chapter 3
[1:03:12] verse 11.
[1:03:14] this is the message you've heard from
[1:03:16] the beginning
[1:03:18] that we should love one another
[1:03:21] nothing new here he's saying you've
[1:03:23] heard this from the beginning it's been
[1:03:24] consistent
[1:03:26] love one another
[1:03:30] a surprising statement not as cain
[1:03:33] who was of that wicked one and killed
[1:03:35] his brother
[1:03:37] and why did he kill him
[1:03:39] because
[1:03:40] cain's works were evil and abels were
[1:03:42] righteous cain was overcome with
[1:03:45] jealousy
[1:03:47] marvel not my brethren if the world hate
[1:03:49] you
[1:03:51] we know that we have passed from death
[1:03:54] unto life
[1:03:56] that's interesting it usually goes the
[1:03:58] other way
[1:03:59] because
[1:04:01] how do we know it
[1:04:03] we love the brethren
[1:04:05] he that doesn't love his brother
[1:04:07] abides in death
[1:04:10] whosoever hates
[1:04:12] whosoever detests
[1:04:14] his brother
[1:04:16] is a murderer
[1:04:18] hence the earlier reference to cain
[1:04:20] and you know that no murderer hath
[1:04:22] eternal life abiding in
[1:04:24] him and now comes the verse
[1:04:27] that hit me between the eyes
[1:04:30] hereby perceive we
[1:04:32] this is how we understand
[1:04:35] this is how we recognize the love of god
[1:04:37] because he lay down his life for us
[1:04:41] and
[1:04:42] here it is
[1:04:43] we ought to lay down our lives
[1:04:46] for the brethren
[1:04:49] i like how the niv puts this verse
[1:04:52] this is how we know what love is
[1:04:55] jesus christ laid down his life for us
[1:04:58] and we ought to lay down our lives
[1:05:01] for our brothers and sisters
[1:05:04] it says brothers and sisters we've
[1:05:06] pointed out before that the greek word
[1:05:07] that's usually translated brothers and
[1:05:09] brethren is a gender neutral word not a
[1:05:12] transgender word a gender-neutral word
[1:05:15] so what does this mean
[1:05:17] well
[1:05:18] john goes on sounding a bit like james
[1:05:21] this point
[1:05:22] who so hath this world's good and sees
[1:05:24] his brother have need and shuts up his
[1:05:26] bowels of compassion from him
[1:05:28] how dwells the love of god in him
[1:05:31] my little children let us not love in
[1:05:33] word neither in tongue but indeed and in
[1:05:36] truth
[1:05:37] james puts it be not hearers but doers
[1:05:42] and hereby we know that we are of the
[1:05:44] truth and shall assure our hearts before
[1:05:47] him for if our heart condemn us god's
[1:05:50] greater than our heart and knows all
[1:05:52] things beloved our heart condemn us not
[1:05:56] then
[1:05:57] we have confidence towards god
[1:05:59] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:06:02] because we keep his commandments
[1:06:04] and do those things that are pleasing in
[1:06:06] his sight
[1:06:09] which commandments are john speaking of
[1:06:11] here
[1:06:12] he tells us in the next verse this is
[1:06:14] his commandment
[1:06:16] that we should believe on the name of
[1:06:17] his son jesus christ
[1:06:20] faith
[1:06:20] and too many of us
[1:06:22] stop there
[1:06:24] but there's an and
[1:06:26] love one another
[1:06:28] our opening scripture this evening as
[1:06:30] jesus conversed with the scribe
[1:06:33] as he gave us commandment which we just
[1:06:35] read in john's gospels
[1:06:38] chapter 13 and 15 to love one another
[1:06:42] as jesus loved us
[1:06:45] and he that keepeth his commandments
[1:06:47] dwelleth in him and he and him and
[1:06:49] hereby we know that he abides in us by
[1:06:51] the spirit which he's given us
[1:06:56] we are to love
[1:06:58] as he loved
[1:07:02] he died for us
[1:07:04] that was sin offering it's done past
[1:07:07] completed at calvary
[1:07:09] that's why he had to be the uniquely
[1:07:12] begotten son of god
[1:07:14] but we're also told romans 8 29 the
[1:07:17] verse after the one that we always quote
[1:07:20] we're told that he was the firstborn
[1:07:22] among many brethren
[1:07:26] that's us
[1:07:28] the firstborn is a rank it carries
[1:07:30] privilege and responsibility as well as
[1:07:32] reward but what is the underlying lesson
[1:07:35] for us
[1:07:37] of his example
[1:07:38] of love
[1:07:41] journey with me back to that last night
[1:07:43] he spent with his apprentices they just
[1:07:46] had a meal together
[1:07:48] jesus had identified judas as the
[1:07:49] traitor after washing judah's feet
[1:07:54] humility
[1:07:55] he had told peter in front of them all
[1:07:57] that peter would turn his back on him
[1:08:00] and then where did he and the remaining
[1:08:02] 11 including peter where did they go
[1:08:06] guess how many
[1:08:08] let's read from luke's gospel chapter 22
[1:08:10] starting at verse 39
[1:08:13] he came out and went as he was want to
[1:08:16] the mount of olives
[1:08:17] in other words he went here often
[1:08:20] one of his favorite places to get alone
[1:08:22] with the father when he was in jerusalem
[1:08:24] to pray
[1:08:25] to seek his will
[1:08:27] and his disciples also followed him
[1:08:30] and when he was at the place a place
[1:08:32] where he often went to pray he said to
[1:08:34] them pray that ye enter not into
[1:08:36] temptation
[1:08:38] temptation is king james english for
[1:08:41] testing
[1:08:42] put to proof
[1:08:43] adversity
[1:08:45] jesus
[1:08:46] was about to confront his greatest test
[1:08:51] and he was withdrawn from them about a
[1:08:53] stone's cast
[1:08:54] and kneeled down
[1:08:57] and prayed
[1:08:58] saying
[1:08:59] father
[1:09:01] if thou be willing
[1:09:03] remove this cup from me
[1:09:08] nevertheless
[1:09:12] not my will but thine be done
[1:09:17] and there appeared an angel unto him
[1:09:19] from heaven
[1:09:21] strengthening him
[1:09:23] and being in an agony
[1:09:26] he prayed more earnestly
[1:09:28] i can't believe that jesus was never
[1:09:30] earnest in his prayers but he's praying
[1:09:32] more earnestly
[1:09:35] and his sweat was as it were great drops
[1:09:37] of blood falling down to the ground this
[1:09:39] was his biggest trial
[1:09:42] matthew tells us he implored his father
[1:09:45] three times to bypass the cross in
[1:09:47] matthew 26 42 we read he went away again
[1:09:50] the second time and prayed saying oh my
[1:09:53] father
[1:09:55] if this cup
[1:09:57] may not pass away from me except i drink
[1:10:00] it
[1:10:02] thy will be done
[1:10:04] and he came and found them asleep again
[1:10:08] for their eyes were heavy
[1:10:10] and he left them and went a gay way
[1:10:12] again and prayed the third time
[1:10:15] saying the same words
[1:10:19] what's the lesson here for us
[1:10:23] jesus died to himself
[1:10:26] at gethsemane
[1:10:28] he surrendered his own will
[1:10:32] and he did it for us
[1:10:36] likewise
[1:10:37] the example
[1:10:39] we must die to self
[1:10:41] surrender our own will reflect that
[1:10:45] nature
[1:10:47] for one another
[1:10:50] oh my
[1:10:51] or is it oh me
[1:10:54] love one another as i have loved you by
[1:10:58] this
[1:10:59] will all men know you're my disciples
[1:11:02] let me share with you something brother
[1:11:04] branham said about this topic from
[1:11:06] revelation chapter five number one
[1:11:07] preached in 1961
[1:11:10] he's giving us a little anecdote here
[1:11:12] about when he was visiting he says a few
[1:11:14] days ago i was sitting talking to my
[1:11:17] loyal little friend here in the city a
[1:11:18] medical doctor sam adair and he said how
[1:11:21] you doing bill
[1:11:23] and i said oh pretty fair i suppose doc
[1:11:26] i said yourself
[1:11:27] and he said oh a lot of patients said i
[1:11:30] had 15 examinations this afternoon
[1:11:33] i said well that's good as long as it's
[1:11:35] just examinations and finding nothing
[1:11:37] wrong
[1:11:38] i said you know that we got talking
[1:11:41] about back when we were boys i said well
[1:11:44] doc i don't know just how long i'm going
[1:11:46] to be around we're both in our 50s and
[1:11:49] he said oh that's true bill
[1:11:52] i said but but all these years about 31
[1:11:54] years of ministry now i've kept my heart
[1:11:57] prepared for that hour when he comes
[1:12:00] so it doesn't matter when he comes
[1:12:02] and he said oh that's true
[1:12:04] i said the greatest thrill i have is
[1:12:08] living for others and he said
[1:12:10] that's what life is makes life real is
[1:12:13] when you not what you can do for or
[1:12:14] accomplish for yourself
[1:12:16] what you can do for others that's sam
[1:12:18] adair talking
[1:12:20] brother brandon goes on see that's when
[1:12:22] you're really living if there happens to
[1:12:25] be someone among us who has never did
[1:12:27] that try to deliver somebody else
[1:12:29] give that a try
[1:12:31] see just how much more life holds for
[1:12:34] you
[1:12:34] well you will not live for what you can
[1:12:36] get yourself out of life
[1:12:38] but what you can give someone else in
[1:12:40] life
[1:12:41] such as i have give i unto you is what
[1:12:44] peter said right
[1:12:46] and you'll find it's more blessed than
[1:12:47] riches or anything that can be thought
[1:12:50] of
[1:12:51] is that what you can
[1:12:52] do for someone else to make life's
[1:12:54] burdens which life itself is a burden
[1:12:57] and will make it a little lighter for
[1:12:59] someone else you just don't know the joy
[1:13:01] unless you tried it once
[1:13:03] to do something
[1:13:04] for someone else
[1:13:08] well that's exactly what john's talking
[1:13:10] about
[1:13:11] and jesus was telling his students
[1:13:14] and demonstrating
[1:13:16] by example that's what surrendering your
[1:13:19] will to him is is to live your life for
[1:13:22] others
[1:13:24] i want to share another excerpt
[1:13:26] this is from
[1:13:27] that day on calvary 1960.
[1:13:31] random saying you're lost to begin with
[1:13:34] as long as you look to what you've done
[1:13:36] but don't look to what you've done
[1:13:39] look what that day on calvary did to you
[1:13:42] it paid your price it settled the
[1:13:44] question your sins be as scarlet they're
[1:13:47] white as snow
[1:13:48] red like crimson fight like wool
[1:13:51] then you have no sin you're perfectly
[1:13:53] sinless no matter what you've done or
[1:13:55] what you do
[1:13:56] you're still sinless as long as you've
[1:13:58] accepted jesus christ as your savior
[1:14:00] your sins are forgiven
[1:14:03] anything is forgiven is remitted and
[1:14:06] forgot about
[1:14:08] then what does it do
[1:14:09] it gives you after that condition his
[1:14:11] spirit to follow him
[1:14:13] and to do as he did
[1:14:15] for others who was following on he was
[1:14:17] just one man the perfect man
[1:14:20] he gave his life and he made an example
[1:14:22] for you
[1:14:24] now what must we do
[1:14:26] now the first thing i want to say is
[1:14:28] jesus never lived for himself
[1:14:31] his life was spent for others
[1:14:33] that's perfectly eternal life when you
[1:14:36] say you go to church and you do good
[1:14:37] things that's fine
[1:14:39] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:14:42] you have an eternal life
[1:14:44] eternal life is living for others
[1:14:47] it proved that when it come in the lamb
[1:14:49] of god he lived
[1:14:51] had eternal life because he did not live
[1:14:53] for himself
[1:14:54] he lived for others
[1:14:56] and you receive eternal life by
[1:14:58] receiving that day and you don't live
[1:15:00] for yourself no more
[1:15:03] you live for others
[1:15:05] someone said how can you stand let
[1:15:07] anybody call you such bad names you
[1:15:10] don't live for yourself
[1:15:12] you live for others that you might
[1:15:13] redeem that man
[1:15:15] you become sons
[1:15:20] and the trouble of it is the church has
[1:15:22] forgot that they were sons
[1:15:25] you're a son
[1:15:27] you're taking christ's place
[1:15:29] you're a son
[1:15:31] so don't live for yourself
[1:15:33] live for others
[1:15:35] well brother branham i can live for this
[1:15:37] brother he's sure a nice man
[1:15:39] that's not it
[1:15:41] live for that man that hates you
[1:15:43] live for that person who would kill you
[1:15:44] if they could
[1:15:46] that's what they'd done to him they
[1:15:47] killed him and he died
[1:15:49] that he might save
[1:15:50] them that's eternal life
[1:15:54] when you that's in your bosom you're
[1:15:56] facing heaven then
[1:15:57] but you sacrifice your own things give
[1:16:00] them up like the sheep gives up its wool
[1:16:02] you look on
[1:16:04] towards calvary
[1:16:06] i hope this helps you to get in a place
[1:16:08] that's what the tabernacle is that's
[1:16:10] what all people has got to do
[1:16:12] is find out what you are
[1:16:14] what's the purpose church isn't going to
[1:16:16] church just to play music sing songs
[1:16:19] church is a place where correction
[1:16:22] judgment begins at the house of god
[1:16:28] matthew and luke allude to this from the
[1:16:30] lips of jesus let's start with luke 13
[1:16:33] 23
[1:16:35] then one said unto him lord
[1:16:38] are there few that be saved
[1:16:41] and he said unto them
[1:16:43] strive
[1:16:45] it's a battle
[1:16:46] it takes work
[1:16:48] hard difficult not always pleasant work
[1:16:51] effort
[1:16:52] strive to enter in at the straight gate
[1:16:55] for many i say unto you will seek to
[1:16:58] enter in and shall not be able
[1:17:02] wait
[1:17:03] i thought you said seek and you shall
[1:17:05] find
[1:17:06] why aren't these able to find
[1:17:09] because it has to be according to his
[1:17:11] will
[1:17:12] it isn't our effort though that effort
[1:17:14] is absolutely required but
[1:17:17] he's sovereign
[1:17:19] he sits on the throne
[1:17:21] as i've said before this isn't her
[1:17:23] democracy
[1:17:24] it isn't politics it's his life in you
[1:17:28] continuing when once the master of the
[1:17:31] house
[1:17:32] who's the master of the house
[1:17:35] you
[1:17:36] me
[1:17:38] it's the father
[1:17:39] when he has risen up and has shut to the
[1:17:42] door and you begin to stand without him
[1:17:44] to knock at the door saying lord lord
[1:17:46] open unto us he shall answer and say
[1:17:48] unto you
[1:17:49] i know you're not once you are.
[1:17:53] what about knock and it shall be opened
[1:17:56] remember who's on the throne
[1:17:58] now is the day of salvation now he's our
[1:18:01] savior then
[1:18:03] he's our judge
[1:18:04] it's all about him
[1:18:06] it's not about us
[1:18:09] then you shall begin to say we have
[1:18:11] eaten and drunk in thy presence
[1:18:14] it's not about bride pride or i was a
[1:18:16] friend of the prophet
[1:18:18] and thou has taught in our streets
[1:18:20] i sponsored your meeting
[1:18:23] he shall say i tell you
[1:18:25] i know not once you are depart from me
[1:18:28] all you workers of iniquity
[1:18:33] let's see what matthew relates chapter 7
[1:18:36] verse 21
[1:18:38] not every one that sayeth unto me lord
[1:18:40] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:18:42] heaven
[1:18:43] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:18:46] which is in heaven
[1:18:51] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:18:53] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:18:55] and thy name have cast out devils and
[1:18:57] thy name done many wonderful works
[1:19:01] well look what he says
[1:19:03] then i will profess unto them i never
[1:19:06] knew you
[1:19:07] we never had a relationship
[1:19:09] depart from me
[1:19:11] yet at work iniquity
[1:19:15] in chapter 25 starting at verse 31
[1:19:19] he really brings it home
[1:19:21] when the son of man shall come in his
[1:19:23] glory
[1:19:24] and all the holy angels with him
[1:19:27] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[1:19:29] glory
[1:19:30] the throne of his glory turns out
[1:19:33] is a throne of judgment
[1:19:35] and before him shall be gathered all
[1:19:37] nations
[1:19:38] and he shall separate them one from
[1:19:40] another as a shepherd divides his sheep
[1:19:42] from the goats
[1:19:44] he shall set the sheep on his right hand
[1:19:46] and goats on the left
[1:19:48] then shall the king
[1:19:51] say unto them on his right hand
[1:19:53] come
[1:19:54] be blessed of my father
[1:19:56] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[1:19:59] from the foundation of the world for
[1:20:02] i was hungry and you fed me i was
[1:20:05] thirsty you gave me a drink i was a
[1:20:07] stranger you took me in naked you
[1:20:09] clothed me i was sick you visited me i
[1:20:11] was in prison you came unto me
[1:20:15] then shall the
[1:20:20] righteous answer him saying
[1:20:22] lord
[1:20:24] when did we see you hungry and fed you
[1:20:26] were thirsty and and gave you a drink
[1:20:28] when did we see you a stranger and took
[1:20:30] you in or naked and clothed you or saw
[1:20:32] with these sick or in prison and came
[1:20:34] unto thee
[1:20:36] and the king shall answer and say unto
[1:20:38] them
[1:20:40] verily i say unto you
[1:20:42] inasmuch as ye have done it unto the one
[1:20:44] of the least of these
[1:20:47] my brethren
[1:20:48] my siblings
[1:20:50] you have done it unto me not my
[1:20:52] followers
[1:20:54] not my servants not my friends
[1:20:57] not my business associates not my
[1:20:59] schoolmates but my family
[1:21:01] my siblings
[1:21:03] god's children
[1:21:05] expressed the love by which all men
[1:21:08] would know that you're my disciples
[1:21:12] then shall we say unto them on the left
[1:21:14] and depart from me you cursed into
[1:21:15] everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[1:21:17] and his angels i was hungry you didn't
[1:21:20] feed me i was thirsty you gave me no
[1:21:22] drink i was a stranger you didn't take
[1:21:24] me in naked you didn't give me clothes
[1:21:26] sick prison you ignored me
[1:21:29] and they'll answer them lord when did we
[1:21:31] see you in this state and didn't help
[1:21:34] you out
[1:21:36] and he answered saying
[1:21:38] verily i say to you in as much as you
[1:21:40] did it not
[1:21:42] to the one of least of these
[1:21:45] you did it not
[1:21:46] to me
[1:21:48] and these shall go away into everlasting
[1:21:50] punishment
[1:21:51] but the righteous
[1:21:53] and to life eternal
[1:21:56] living for others
[1:21:58] as brother branham puts it
[1:22:00] is really summed up as
[1:22:02] dying to self
[1:22:05] dying
[1:22:06] to live
[1:22:08] and john's first letter of the church
[1:22:09] expresses it is dying
[1:22:12] to self for others
[1:22:15] it's all the same thing
[1:22:18] that's exactly how that love that we
[1:22:20] must have
[1:22:21] is expressed
[1:22:23] the love by which all men
[1:22:25] shall know
[1:22:26] that you are my disciples is how jesus
[1:22:29] put it it's a constant struggle
[1:22:31] it's a battle
[1:22:32] it's not a one and done sort of thing
[1:22:35] listen what jesus said found in matthew
[1:22:38] 10 verse 38
[1:22:42] and he that taketh not his cross
[1:22:45] doesn't surrender his own will
[1:22:48] and follow after me
[1:22:50] is not worthy of me
[1:22:53] he that finds his life shall lose it
[1:22:56] he that loses his life for my sake
[1:22:59] shall find it
[1:23:01] he's talking about dying to self
[1:23:04] not a literal cross
[1:23:06] but think of the effect this
[1:23:08] illustration had
[1:23:10] on his audience
[1:23:12] they witnessed literal crucifixions
[1:23:15] regularly
[1:23:17] the horror of it
[1:23:18] the fact that it was imposed on them by
[1:23:21] the hated conquerors
[1:23:23] the romans
[1:23:24] gentiles heathens
[1:23:27] ruling over them
[1:23:28] inflicting terrible pain and suffering
[1:23:31] and that's the context that they heard
[1:23:35] this
[1:23:36] luke tells us a bit more about this
[1:23:39] chapter 9
[1:23:41] verse 23
[1:23:43] he said to them all if any man will come
[1:23:46] after me let him deny himself
[1:23:50] let him die to himself
[1:23:52] and take up his cross
[1:23:55] ooh
[1:23:56] two steps die to self
[1:23:59] live for others
[1:24:00] how often must we do this
[1:24:02] we must deny our own will and take up
[1:24:05] the cross death to self he says daily
[1:24:09] this is a daily thing this is ongoing
[1:24:14] and follow me he's carrying his cross
[1:24:17] too
[1:24:19] he was alone
[1:24:21] my god
[1:24:22] why have you forsaken me
[1:24:25] here now when i need you the most
[1:24:30] but we're not we're not alone
[1:24:33] he says i'll never leave you
[1:24:36] nor forsake you
[1:24:38] he's been there
[1:24:40] for whosoever
[1:24:41] will save his life
[1:24:44] shall lose it
[1:24:45] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:24:49] the same
[1:24:50] shall save it
[1:24:52] it's not optional
[1:24:54] today we'd say it's a mandate
[1:24:57] die
[1:24:58] daily
[1:25:00] it's not easy
[1:25:02] it's an ongoing exercise
[1:25:04] i'm closing now
[1:25:07] it requires dedication
[1:25:09] work
[1:25:11] failing
[1:25:12] falling down
[1:25:14] getting up
[1:25:16] falling again
[1:25:18] getting up
[1:25:20] falling again
[1:25:22] and again
[1:25:23] and again
[1:25:25] because he wants children with character
[1:25:28] not clones without choice
[1:25:31] how can we do this
[1:25:33] back to john's gospel
[1:25:35] the first chapter
[1:25:37] as many as received him
[1:25:39] to them gave he power
[1:25:41] to become
[1:25:43] the sons of god
[1:25:45] even to them
[1:25:47] that believe on his name which were born
[1:25:50] not of blood
[1:25:51] nor the will of the flesh nor the will
[1:25:53] of man
[1:25:54] but of god
[1:25:57] we must be born again
[1:26:00] born of his spirit
[1:26:02] become his children
[1:26:04] dying to self
[1:26:07] loving each other
[1:26:09] what assurance do we then have paul
[1:26:11] tells us in our final verse of the
[1:26:13] evening
[1:26:14] found in the first chapter
[1:26:16] of philippians
[1:26:18] being confident
[1:26:20] assured
[1:26:22] not a shadow of a doubt of this very
[1:26:25] thing
[1:26:26] that he that hath begun a good work in
[1:26:28] you
[1:26:29] who is that
[1:26:32] papa god
[1:26:33] will perform it until he gets bored with
[1:26:37] it all tires of us and takes a nap
[1:26:39] no
[1:26:41] until the day of jesus christ
[1:26:44] if he's begun that good work in you
[1:26:47] then you can possess that confidence
[1:26:51] as brother aaron comes to close the
[1:26:53] service maybe we could sing he's all i
[1:26:56] need
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:04] need
[1:27:06] he's
[1:27:08] all i need
[1:27:13] jesus
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:23] is
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:35] jesus
[1:27:38] he is
[1:27:40] all i
[1:27:42] need
[1:27:54] he is
[1:27:56] all i know
[1:28:00] he is
[1:28:02] all i
[1:28:04] need
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:06] jesus
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:14] if you'll stand with me i'm going to
[1:28:16] live
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:28] wants me
[1:28:30] to live
[1:28:32] i'm going to give
[1:28:36] until they're just no
[1:28:40] more to give
[1:28:43] i'm going to love
[1:28:47] love till there's just no more
[1:28:54] i could never
[1:28:57] never out love
[1:29:00] the lord one more time
[1:29:04] i'm going to live
[1:29:08] the way he
[1:29:11] wants me
[1:29:13] to live
[1:29:15] i'm going to give
[1:29:18] until there's just no more
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:46] i'm going to live
[1:29:48] the way he wants me to live
[1:29:51] i'm going to give until there's just no
[1:29:54] more ticket
[1:29:56] that's what the song says and that's
[1:29:58] what we've sung
[1:30:01] but you can't do it by yourself
[1:30:04] you can't make this happen on your own
[1:30:07] you have to surrender to him first
[1:30:09] you have to yield to him and let him
[1:30:11] live in you
[1:30:13] and then his nature because you are his
[1:30:15] children begins to reflect
[1:30:18] in our best efforts and our best
[1:30:20] how many times have gotten them in the
[1:30:22] morning today lord i'm gonna give myself
[1:30:24] to you i'm gonna i'm gonna help somebody
[1:30:26] and then something else comes up and
[1:30:28] then
[1:30:28] the days gone by you didn't accomplish
[1:30:30] the things you thought you could
[1:30:32] accomplish
[1:30:33] but you say in the morning when you get
[1:30:35] out of bed when you wake up get your day
[1:30:37] started lord i surrender all
[1:30:39] you guide me you lead me
[1:30:42] you allow me to give that which you've
[1:30:44] placed in me
[1:30:46] and then he being that's my child that's
[1:30:48] my daughter that's my son
[1:30:50] and he begins to express himself
[1:30:53] in you
[1:30:55] because you are a child of god
[1:30:57] you are a son and daughter of god
[1:31:00] he
[1:31:01] did that for you
[1:31:03] and and sometimes a message like this is
[1:31:05] just makes a stop for a woman look at
[1:31:07] ourselves closely
[1:31:10] lord i didn't do too good today or but
[1:31:12] help me lord
[1:31:14] i wanna i wanna do that i get up in the
[1:31:16] morning and say well i'm gonna do this
[1:31:17] i'm gonna do this i'm gonna
[1:31:19] but first we should say lord what would
[1:31:20] you have me do today
[1:31:22] and he brings someone across your way
[1:31:24] something happens and you're able
[1:31:27] to manifest christ to others amen
[1:31:31] and he puts it clearly in the scripture
[1:31:33] he said when did we do this to you lord
[1:31:36] when you did it to one of my little ones
[1:31:39] amen it makes life worth the living so
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:43] let's just bow our hands for a moment
[1:31:44] lord
[1:31:47] all of us here under the sound of
[1:31:50] the voice she used today and brother
[1:31:51] lyle lord and those listening
[1:31:54] we all look at ourselves closely and
[1:31:56] said i definitely could do better
[1:31:59] i definitely could give more
[1:32:02] lord help us just to surrender and let
[1:32:04] you
[1:32:05] lord with that purpose in life
[1:32:08] lord
[1:32:09] to be a true disciple
[1:32:11] a true follower a true example
[1:32:15] of jesus christ on this earth is our
[1:32:17] prayer lord
[1:32:18] to one another lord
[1:32:20] and that others may see
[1:32:22] god christ in us
[1:32:24] for it's the hope of glory lord
[1:32:27] we ask it in jesus christ's name
