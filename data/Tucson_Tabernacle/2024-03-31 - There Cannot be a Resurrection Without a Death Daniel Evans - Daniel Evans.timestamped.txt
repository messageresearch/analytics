[14:58] shalom
[15:01] sh English English the peace of God be
[15:05] with you truly the peace of God be with
[15:07] you this morning my name is Mark I wrote
[15:10] a book about the life of Jesus Christ
[15:14] most books about a person end with their
[15:16] death but that's in chapter 15 my book
[15:19] goes on to chapter 16 and we're going to
[15:21] share that with you this
[15:23] morning now when the Sabbath was passed
[15:26] Saturday night after the sun had gone
[15:28] down Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of
[15:31] James and slom bought spices that they
[15:34] might come and anoint the body of
[15:37] Jesus very early in the morning on the
[15:39] first day of the week Sunday morning
[15:42] they came to the Tomb at the rising of
[15:44] the Sun and they said among themselves
[15:48] who will roll away the stone for
[15:51] us but when they looked up they saw that
[15:54] the stone had been rolled away it was
[15:56] very large and entering the tomb
[15:59] they saw a young man clothed in a long
[16:01] white robe sitting on the right side and
[16:04] they were alarmed but he said to
[16:09] them do not be alarmed you see Jesus of
[16:12] Nazareth who is crucified he is risen he
[16:15] is not here see the place where they
[16:17] laid him but go tell his disciples and
[16:19] Peter that he will go before you into
[16:21] Galilee there you will see him as he
[16:23] said to
[16:24] you so they went out quickly from the
[16:27] tomb for they trembled LED and were
[16:31] amazed they said nothing to anyone for
[16:34] they were
[16:35] afraid now when Jesus rose early on the
[16:40] first day of the week he appeared first
[16:42] to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had
[16:45] cast seven
[16:49] demons she went and told those who had
[16:52] been with him as they mourned and wept
[16:55] and when they heard that he was alive
[16:57] and had been seen by her
[16:59] they didn't believe her after that he
[17:02] appeared in another form unto two of
[17:04] them as they walked and went into the
[17:06] country and they went and told it to the
[17:09] rest but they didn't believe them
[17:12] either later he appeared to the 11 as
[17:15] they sat at the table and he rebuked
[17:18] their unbelief and Hardness of Heart
[17:20] because they did not believe those
[17:22] Witnesses who had seen him after he had
[17:25] risen and he then said unto them go ye
[17:29] into all the world and preach the gospel
[17:30] to Every Creature he that believeth and
[17:32] is baptized shall be saved but he that
[17:34] believeth not shall be damn condemned
[17:37] and these signs that shall fall they
[17:38] believe in my name they shall cast out
[17:40] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[17:42] they shall take up serpents if they
[17:43] drink of any deadly thing they shall not
[17:45] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[17:47] sick and they shall recover amen so then
[17:51] after the Lord had spoken to them he was
[17:53] received up into heaven and sat down at
[17:57] the right hand of the god and they went
[18:00] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[18:03] with them and confirming the word
[18:06] through accompanying signs

[28:17] bike while riding in Mexico I believe
[28:22] and he is now uh unconscious and his

[28:28] responding so we're praying that God
[28:29] will heal him that's a serious need it's
[28:32] not too serious for the Lord and another
[28:34] request from Sister Salazar she's she
[28:36] was cleaning this week and she got
[28:38] something in her right eye and for the
[28:40] past four days she's been seeing uh with
[28:42] a film over it and it's scary because
[28:45] some of you know she already has a
[28:46] problem in her left eye and she relies
[28:49] on her good eye to do things that she'd
[28:53] need to do on an everyday basis if we
[28:54] could have the brothers come up to
[28:56] prepare for prayer this morning she
[28:58] relies on that good eye and so now this
[29:01] eye is is damaged and she's been having
[29:03] headaches and trouble driving and she
[29:05] doesn't want to have to go to the doctor
[29:07] or the or the ER she's asking God to
[29:11] heal her and restore her he can he's
[29:15] able he's done it before he'll do it

[50:02] on them I'm going to tell a secret on
[50:05] I'm not going to embarrass you though
[50:06] okay so Daniel after I ministered last
[50:11] Sunday Daniel came up to me and and I
[50:14] know my
[50:15] son and he said uh he said hey Dad how's
[50:19] it going and that means I could care
[50:21] less how it's going but I got to tell
[50:23] you
[50:25] something so he says uh here here's the
[50:28] thing he says you know you were talking
[50:30] about um Taylor
[50:32] Swift in in uh last last Sunday sermon I
[50:36] said yeah he goes here's the thing dad
[50:38] he says he says you know that that um
[50:41] that place is it is a boba is that what
[50:43] it's
[50:44] called that place it's a it's a Boba
[50:47] place he said he says you know that
[50:49] place and and the owner a a Christian
[50:51] guy and I said yeah he says you know
[50:53] they have a car karaoke machine there
[50:55] and I said yeah he said dad last night I
[50:57] sang Two Taylor Swift
[51:02] songs like
[51:05] buddy and he said yeah dad he says and I
[51:09] was like well I said you know I probably
[51:10] wouldn't have said it if I would have
[51:12] known that that you were doing that but
[51:14] that was just the Lord and and when we
[51:17] do something if we make a mistake the
[51:20] best thing that we can do is to correct
[51:22] that mistake amen so d said but Dad
[51:27] while we were there he said that this
[51:31] owner he's a Vietnamese man he said he
[51:34] invited us to sing in his
[51:38] church and I said sing
[51:43] what no so so the actually our young
[51:47] people went to this Vietnamese Christian
[51:51] church and Daniel was taking videos
[51:53] while while they were um fellowshipping
[51:56] and they sang for this church and they
[51:59] blessed this church it was it was you
[52:02] all right the new the numer sisters were
[52:04] there and Daniel was there and I think a
[52:06] lot of them were there and it just
[52:09] blessed this this church to reach out
[52:12] like that so
[52:14] then they go there they went hiking
[52:17] yesterday and they they had the the
[52:20] youth together and they came here and
[52:21] practiced and then they went back last
[52:25] night to the Boba te place and Daniel
[52:29] took some
[52:31] videos when he was there our young
[52:36] people were there with that karaoke
[52:39] machine and they had the whole
[52:41] establishment up and praising the Lord
[52:45] and and dancing to the spirit of the
[52:47] Lord singing gospel
[52:50] songs I'm so proud of you all yes let's
[52:56] keep this going you know it's we've
[52:58] everything's been going so well and the
[53:00] Lord's been blessing us so much I what I
[53:02] want to say is Satan get out of the way
[53:04] because we just
[53:05] started we're coming and you better get
[53:08] out of the
[53:11] way what a what an exciting time that we
[53:16] live in and on this
[53:19] Resurrection on this wonderful day that
[53:23] happened 2,000 years ago when Jesus came
[53:25] out of the Tomb
[53:27] we have to understand what happened
[53:30] during this time and remember you can't
[53:34] have a resurrection without a
[53:37] death I mean you can't raise something
[53:40] from the dead if it's not dead right and
[53:42] you can't have a death brothers and
[53:44] sisters you can't have death without
[53:46] suffering so it's all part of this great
[53:51] plan and the best times in our lives
[53:55] brothers and sisters are not the good
[53:56] times are not the prosperous times the
[53:59] best times in our lives and many many of
[54:02] us can look back are the times that we
[54:04] were
[54:04] suffering let's turn to Isaiah chapter
[54:07] 53 now this was written 700
[54:11] years before the prophecy came to pass
[54:16] in this Messiah this man named Jesus
[54:20] Christ Isaiah
[54:22] 53 verse number one says this who hath
[54:26] believed our report and to whom is the
[54:29] arm of the Lord revealed for he shall
[54:32] grow up before him as a tender plant and
[54:35] as a
[54:37] root out of a dry ground he hath no form
[54:40] nor comeliness and when we shall see him
[54:43] there is no beauty that we should just
[54:45] desire him so he's saying he's just
[54:47] going to be an everyday young man not
[54:50] even particularly goodlooking maybe like
[54:53] Moses was or like Joseph was in the
[54:55] Bible this is an ordinary
[54:59] man he's despised and rejected of men a
[55:03] Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and
[55:06] we hid as it were our faces from
[55:10] him he was despised and we esteemed him
[55:14] not surely he hath borne our griefs and
[55:19] carried our sorrows and yet we did
[55:21] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[55:24] Afflicted but he was wounded wounded for
[55:26] our
[55:27] transgressions he was bruised for our
[55:29] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[55:32] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[55:35] healed all we like sheep have gone
[55:40] astray we have turned everyone to his
[55:45] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[55:49] the iniquity of us all he was oppressed
[55:51] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[55:54] his mouth he he is brought as a lamb to
[55:57] the slaughter and as a sheep before the
[55:59] shears is dumb so he opened not his
[56:01] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[56:05] judgment and who shall declare his
[56:08] generation for he was cut off out of the
[56:11] land of the living for the transgression
[56:14] of my people was he
[56:16] stricken and he was and he made his
[56:19] grave with the
[56:20] Wicked the thieves on the
[56:23] cross and with the rich in his death
[56:27] Joseph of
[56:28] arthea because he had done no violence
[56:30] neither was there any deceit in his
[56:33] mouth I wish I could have that testimony
[56:36] amen yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[56:40] him he hath put him to
[56:43] grief when thou shalt make his soul an
[56:46] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[56:49] he shall prolong his days and the
[56:51] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[56:53] his
[56:54] hand he shall see
[56:58] of the travail of his soul and shall be
[57:01] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[57:04] righteous servant justify many for he
[57:07] shall bear their
[57:08] iniquities
[57:10] therefore will I divide him a portion
[57:13] with the great and he shall divide the
[57:15] spoil with the strong because he hath
[57:19] poured out his soul unto death and he
[57:23] was numbered with the transgressors and
[57:25] he bear the sin of many and made
[57:27] intercession for the
[57:30] transgressors what a prophecy that was
[57:32] wholly and fully fulfilled in this man
[57:35] named Jesus Christ that came 700 years
[57:39] after the prophet Isaiah prophesied
[57:43] that a man of sorrow and
[57:48] grief and today we celebrate the
[57:50] resurrection of Jesus but last week was
[57:54] Palm Sunday the Bible says he rode into
[57:57] Jerusalem the most important city in the
[58:00] world rode in on a donkey and people
[58:03] were celebrating his arrival like David
[58:06] coming in to the city with the Ark on
[58:09] the shoulders of the Levites and David
[58:11] danced before it was a wonderful time
[58:13] that Jesus came they were they were
[58:15] taking off their garments and they were
[58:16] throwing them down in front of the
[58:19] donkey that Jesus rode on and and with
[58:22] the Palm leaves and singing
[58:24] hosana To The King
[58:26] King but that time fulfilled scripture
[58:32] but as far as Jesus's Ministry it was a
[58:35] very small almost very almost
[58:39] unimportant
[58:41] part if you and I were there we would
[58:43] think that this was my highlight of my
[58:45] life this was the greatest time that
[58:47] I've ever
[58:48] lived that when they finally recognized
[58:51] who I
[58:52] was but it wasn't with Jesus his time
[58:57] his greatest time was yet to come and it
[58:59] would happen within a week a week later
[59:02] after he rode
[59:04] in on Palm
[59:07] Sunday
[59:09] now when he came
[59:13] in it it it was a it was a good day and
[59:18] then during that week things gradually
[59:20] got worse and then it came to the real
[59:24] suffering the Bible says in 2
[59:26] Corinthians 12:9 the Apostle Paul says
[59:28] this and he said unto me so Paul he
[59:32] couldn't see he had a thorn in his flesh
[59:36] his eyesight wasn't very good he may
[59:37] have been suffering from some sickness
[59:39] and he sought the Lord three times and
[59:41] the Lord said to him my grace is
[59:43] sufficient for thee my my strength is
[59:45] made perfect in
[59:47] weakness most gladly therefore will I
[59:50] rather GL glory in my infirmities that
[59:53] the power of Christ May rest upon me
[59:56] therefore I take pleasure in infirmities
[59:58] and reproaches and necessities and
[1:00:00] persecutions in distresses for Christ's
[1:00:03] sake for when I am weak then I am
[1:00:08] strong 1 Peter chap 5:10 says this but
[1:00:12] the God of all Grace who hath called us
[1:00:15] unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus
[1:00:20] after that ye have suffered a
[1:00:24] while make you perfect
[1:00:26] perfect establish you strengthen settle
[1:00:32] you Ecclesiastes 71 says this a good
[1:00:36] name is better than precious ointment
[1:00:39] and the day of
[1:00:41] death than the day of one's
[1:00:44] birth it is better to go to the house of
[1:00:47] mourning than to go to the house of
[1:00:49] feasting for that is the end of all men
[1:00:52] and the living will lay it to his heart
[1:00:56] sorrow is better than
[1:00:59] laughter for by the sadness of the of
[1:01:02] the countenance The Heart Is Made better
[1:01:04] the heart of the wise is in the house of
[1:01:07] mourning but the heart of fools is in
[1:01:10] the house of Mirth I don't
[1:01:14] think when we read this and we we read
[1:01:16] of of the The Passion of Christ this
[1:01:20] this week that that Jesus went to I
[1:01:22] don't believe that the Lord wants us to
[1:01:25] suffer I don't think that's the point I
[1:01:28] don't think he he wants bad things to
[1:01:30] happen to us it's like if you know
[1:01:35] like going to going to my wife is like
[1:01:38] hey honey I got a $1,000 bonus today oh
[1:01:42] I'm sorry
[1:01:44] honey I'm I'm really sorry we we should
[1:01:47] we should lament that no good things are
[1:01:49] good things and he doesn't it doesn't
[1:01:51] say it's like hey uh hey honey remember
[1:01:54] that speeding ticket I got the other day
[1:01:56] our insurance went up
[1:01:59] 25% yes we're going to suffer for that
[1:02:02] one that's really good yeah the dog died
[1:02:05] this
[1:02:07] morning that's not that's not what he
[1:02:10] wants that's not what it's about but
[1:02:13] it's during those low times that God
[1:02:17] really speaks to
[1:02:20] us human nature brothers and sisters
[1:02:22] human nature requires suffering our
[1:02:26] nature gravitates towards sin and God
[1:02:29] uses the suffering that we have to
[1:02:32] perfect us even you go all the way back
[1:02:34] to the Book of Genesis and you look the
[1:02:37] first thing God says do whatever you
[1:02:40] want but don't do this one thing look at
[1:02:43] the nature of a human being goes
[1:02:45] directly to that one thing that he said
[1:02:47] not to do it's the nature of a human
[1:02:49] being to go towards sin and it's the
[1:02:53] good times when times are easier and we
[1:02:56] have we have memories maybe of having
[1:02:58] more money or or having a little bit
[1:03:01] better job or an easier time of life
[1:03:03] most of the time that that our lives
[1:03:06] don't make any changes we only make
[1:03:08] changes maybe for the worst in those
[1:03:10] times but the best times the good times
[1:03:13] are not
[1:03:14] associated brothers and sisters with
[1:03:16] positive change wow in fact the good
[1:03:20] times are the hardest times to
[1:03:22] change it's in the hard times that we
[1:03:25] make changes in our lives like the Rich
[1:03:27] Young Ruler things were going really
[1:03:30] good for this young man he had a lot of
[1:03:32] money everything was good he had a high
[1:03:34] standing in the church everyone
[1:03:35] respected him and he sees this man who
[1:03:39] people were calling the Messiah and a
[1:03:41] prophet and he sees this this he hears
[1:03:43] his teaching he says oh this man is
[1:03:45] great and he knew that this Jesus
[1:03:48] something about him was associated with
[1:03:51] eternal
[1:03:52] life so this Rich Young Ruler goes to
[1:03:56] the Lord he bowed bows down before him
[1:03:58] he pays him respect and he says what
[1:04:01] must I do to obtain eternal
[1:04:04] life and Jesus looked on him and loved
[1:04:07] him there was something about this young
[1:04:09] man Jesus saw he said you haven't
[1:04:14] suffered things are too
[1:04:17] good and he said sell everything that
[1:04:21] you have give it to the
[1:04:24] poor and then come follow
[1:04:27] me because this young man hadn't had any
[1:04:30] problems in his life there was no there
[1:04:32] wasn't that great character that was
[1:04:34] there so then he he goes and he the man
[1:04:38] was
[1:04:40] grieved and he couldn't do
[1:04:43] it he had a chance maybe to be a
[1:04:47] disciple we don't even know his
[1:04:49] name if he would have made the right
[1:04:52] choice yes he would have suffered yes
[1:04:54] there would have been problems s but
[1:04:57] instead the next time we see this young
[1:05:00] man he's in
[1:05:01] Hell lost his
[1:05:04] salvation and then on the other side
[1:05:06] there was a beggar named
[1:05:09] Lazarus that just had nothing in his
[1:05:11] life that was always
[1:05:13] struggling and we see that Lazarus when
[1:05:16] he died he went up right into the bosom
[1:05:19] of
[1:05:20] Abraham the Rich Young Ruler he died he
[1:05:22] went down to
[1:05:24] Hell we see which is more important the
[1:05:26] good times and the bad times I was
[1:05:30] talking with a uh a guy at the gym I've
[1:05:34] known for a while he's come to church
[1:05:35] here a couple times he's not he'd be
[1:05:37] fine with me telling the
[1:05:40] story he came up to me and I I said I
[1:05:43] said hey how you doing um and he said uh
[1:05:46] he said not so
[1:05:48] good I was like okay
[1:05:51] um here we
[1:05:54] go and uh
[1:05:57] he says you know he said I'm sick of
[1:05:59] it and I said what do you mean you're
[1:06:02] sick of it he says you know he says God
[1:06:04] always sends these women into my
[1:06:08] life and he said and I get attached to
[1:06:11] them and and and I I I give them I start
[1:06:14] talking with them they tell me their
[1:06:15] problems and I counsel them and he says
[1:06:18] then they just they then they leave
[1:06:22] me and I said I said really and I said
[1:06:26] that's God's
[1:06:27] fault and he says yeah he says why does
[1:06:30] he send them into my
[1:06:32] life if it's if it's not for me if it's
[1:06:37] just to make just to hurt me just to
[1:06:39] upset me and I said I said okay I said I
[1:06:42] knew the answer but I said and how old
[1:06:45] is this
[1:06:47] girl he says she's
[1:06:50] 25 and I said and how old are you 47
[1:06:58] I said don't blame God for your bad
[1:07:03] decisions right we can look at these we
[1:07:07] can go through life and say oh just
[1:07:09] because God puts something something
[1:07:10] comes into my path that doesn't mean to
[1:07:13] take
[1:07:15] itow make a
[1:07:17] decision in your
[1:07:19] life so he's he's there he says he says
[1:07:22] what I do he says I talk to these people
[1:07:24] he says I spend my time and and they
[1:07:27] they tell me all their problems and I
[1:07:28] help them and I counsel them and and
[1:07:31] then he said finally they get they they
[1:07:35] they don't want to talk to me anymore
[1:07:36] and then then they just shun me I was
[1:07:39] like oh yeah takes all your time he goes
[1:07:42] yeah and I just give and give and give
[1:07:43] and give and God never gives me anything
[1:07:46] I was like listen man I've been sitting
[1:07:47] here for 30
[1:07:50] minutes you just got a free counseling
[1:07:52] session from the
[1:07:54] pastor and I said what did I get out of
[1:07:59] this said write a check Tucson
[1:08:01] Tabernacle make an
[1:08:05] offering but it's all about me he was
[1:08:07] thinking about himself and when I told
[1:08:09] him I said listen I said you haven't
[1:08:11] gone far
[1:08:12] enough I said what you should do is you
[1:08:15] should say Lord if you never want me to
[1:08:19] have a wife I just want to be in your
[1:08:21] will if you never want me to have
[1:08:24] another job Lord just let me be in your
[1:08:26] will I will do everything that I can to
[1:08:28] serve you and work as hard as I can but
[1:08:31] if you don't want it Lord I want your
[1:08:33] will and I said you're not there yet and
[1:08:37] I believe this young man I believe young
[1:08:39] man he's almost my age
[1:08:42] is a child of God I really
[1:08:45] do and I think that his time is coming
[1:08:50] that he's going to have to make a
[1:08:51] decision he might be forced to make a
[1:08:53] decision I was talking with
[1:08:56] another young man's about Daniel's
[1:09:01] age found himself in
[1:09:04] jail been there for a little while and I
[1:09:07] went and visited
[1:09:09] him and I never met him
[1:09:13] before he's got a good family he's a
[1:09:15] good mom got a good brother he's he's
[1:09:19] he's he's got a good
[1:09:21] child and he just made bad decisions all
[1:09:25] through his
[1:09:27] life and finally this bad the last bad
[1:09:30] decision landed him in jail and now he's
[1:09:33] awaiting waiting
[1:09:35] sentencing and
[1:09:37] he he was talking to me and I was I
[1:09:41] was understanding what he was what he
[1:09:44] was doing and and and he said I said Do
[1:09:48] you believe
[1:09:49] God is in all this he goes I know he
[1:09:52] is he made the wrong decisions all the
[1:09:55] time until he got put in a jail cell and
[1:09:59] then he says now he goes he goes Pastor
[1:10:02] now all I have is time he says I think
[1:10:05] about the Lord all the time when I now
[1:10:07] that I'm here but before I was here he
[1:10:08] says I never thought about
[1:10:11] him and he says now I'm
[1:10:13] here and I don't have anywhere else to
[1:10:17] go and he says now I'm praying and I
[1:10:20] said brother this is the best time of
[1:10:23] your
[1:10:24] life it may seem hard this may seem like
[1:10:27] the hardest time but it's
[1:10:30] not it is when it is the hardest times
[1:10:33] in our
[1:10:34] lives that God finally can he's knocking
[1:10:39] all the time but it's the hard times
[1:10:42] that we finally
[1:10:45] listen there's a woman Matthew chapter
[1:10:49] 15 we call her a syap phenician woman
[1:10:52] she was her daughter
[1:10:55] was mentally ill her daughter had ma
[1:10:59] major major problems so she comes to the
[1:11:02] Lord
[1:11:04] Jesus let's read it Matthew
[1:11:08] 15:21 then Jesus went then and departed
[1:11:11] under the coast of Ty and siden and
[1:11:13] behold a woman of Canaan came out of the
[1:11:15] same coast and Cried unto him saying
[1:11:17] have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of
[1:11:20] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:11:22] with a vexed with a devil but he
[1:11:24] answered her not a
[1:11:26] word and the disciples came and besought
[1:11:28] him saying send her away for she crith
[1:11:30] after us so this woman came to Jesus and
[1:11:33] he ignored her let me tell you she
[1:11:36] wasn't quite low
[1:11:38] enough she wasn't quite surrendered
[1:11:41] enough she wasn't quite at Rock Bottom
[1:11:44] there yet she was about as bad as it can
[1:11:46] get but there there was still a little
[1:11:48] bit more that she had to
[1:11:50] do all the pride maybe was not out of
[1:11:53] her yet
[1:11:57] it's a hard one to
[1:11:58] swallow but he answered and
[1:12:01] said I am not
[1:12:04] sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[1:12:07] House of Israel he looks at her he says
[1:12:09] look at you you're not even a
[1:12:12] believer you don't look like us you
[1:12:14] don't act like us you're not worth my
[1:12:18] time what would I have done if someone
[1:12:22] treated me like
[1:12:24] that
[1:12:29] it wasn't the
[1:12:31] case for this woman though her daughter
[1:12:34] was the most important
[1:12:37] thing then came
[1:12:40] she and worshiped him saying Lord help
[1:12:44] me was she low enough
[1:12:47] yet but he answered and said it is not
[1:12:51] meat to take the children's bread and to
[1:12:53] cast it to dogs he's saying do you want
[1:12:55] to take my
[1:12:57] time you think my time is worth giving
[1:12:59] to a dog like
[1:13:03] you but her daughter is more important
[1:13:07] than her
[1:13:09] pride and she said truth Lord yet the
[1:13:13] dogs eat the crumbs which fall from
[1:13:15] their master's
[1:13:16] table she says Lord you are my master
[1:13:19] Lord You're my king I'm not worthy even
[1:13:21] to sit at this table but I'll take just
[1:13:24] a few crumbs that fall off then Jesus
[1:13:26] answered and said unto her oh woman
[1:13:28] great is thy faith be it unto thee even
[1:13:30] as thou Wilt and her daughter was made
[1:13:32] whole from that very hour so she had
[1:13:35] reached rock bottom but notice she
[1:13:39] didn't just sit there and not do
[1:13:41] anything and then when she came into a
[1:13:43] little resistance she didn't just say I
[1:13:46] will it must not be the Lord's
[1:13:48] will she didn't just say well I'm
[1:13:50] trusting that the Lord will heal my
[1:13:51] daughter it's a promise and I accept it
[1:13:54] brother sister I'm just going to hold
[1:13:55] fast to that that's not what she
[1:13:58] did that's the mistake that many of us
[1:14:02] make we get lazy we're not willing to
[1:14:05] give
[1:14:07] everything so that we can receive what
[1:14:09] we ask for so then God in his kindness
[1:14:12] and his compassion he will put on this
[1:14:15] hardship to
[1:14:17] us put us on our
[1:14:19] back and then finally he can get through
[1:14:22] to us and speak to us
[1:14:26] my children are here I'll tell you the
[1:14:29] hardest
[1:14:30] time in our lives with me and Stephanie
[1:14:34] was when our kids weren't serving the
[1:14:38] lord and we we would cry and we would
[1:14:42] pray and and and we we didn't know what
[1:14:44] to
[1:14:45] do crying out to God saying Lord I don't
[1:14:49] care what it
[1:14:50] is Lord I will I will give everything up
[1:14:54] I will give my job up I will give my
[1:14:56] Ministry up I will give it all up and
[1:14:58] Lord save my
[1:15:01] kids I don't care what it is wow Lord I
[1:15:05] am
[1:15:06] humbled Lord help
[1:15:10] us and they saved my
[1:15:12] kids and it was at the hardest time that
[1:15:16] really we get an answer back and and I
[1:15:19] remember praying it's like Lord we've
[1:15:20] homeschooled them we've never missed a
[1:15:22] service at
[1:15:23] church I've done everything I've known
[1:15:26] how to do to just walk this perfect
[1:15:30] line kept them from the neighbor
[1:15:34] kids protected them as far as who they
[1:15:37] hang out with and then I felt like
[1:15:41] Stephanie and I both got an
[1:15:44] answer was
[1:15:46] that my
[1:15:48] will God
[1:15:50] speaking or was that your
[1:15:53] will is that how you think this should
[1:15:57] be happen is that how you think or have
[1:16:00] you really surrendered your life have
[1:16:02] you really fallen
[1:16:04] down and ask the Lord Lord I don't care
[1:16:09] however you want to lead me we will
[1:16:11] follow and that's what these hard times
[1:16:16] that's what these
[1:16:18] troubles give us they give us a
[1:16:21] surrender that's what they gave to the
[1:16:26] lord it's in the lowest times in our
[1:16:28] lives that God really speaks to us and
[1:16:31] that's the time when we respond to him
[1:16:33] as I said he's always
[1:16:35] knocking but in the good times in our
[1:16:37] minds everything's going good that's not
[1:16:40] when we
[1:16:44] answer the hard times the worst times
[1:16:47] they're the greatest
[1:16:50] times we love hearing testimonies from
[1:16:52] people that that they go through a hard
[1:16:54] time time and and then they come out we
[1:16:56] love
[1:16:58] that because they went through it as I
[1:17:02] said you can't have a resurrection if
[1:17:04] you don't have a
[1:17:05] death and you can't have a death if you
[1:17:08] don't have
[1:17:11] suffering that's what happened in the
[1:17:12] Garden of
[1:17:14] Gethsemane Jesus comes
[1:17:18] down his
[1:17:20] disciples heaviness he knew what was
[1:17:23] going to happen
[1:17:26] he goes and he asks his friends he says
[1:17:28] can you just pray with me a little
[1:17:31] bit I didn't think it was that
[1:17:36] important he gets there and he gets on
[1:17:38] his knees and he ask the Lord the father
[1:17:43] remember he was a
[1:17:45] son he was the high priest that can be
[1:17:47] touched by the feeling of our
[1:17:48] infirmities he was
[1:17:51] real he knew how it was to suffer he
[1:17:54] knew knew how it was to feel
[1:17:57] Temptation he knew what we were going
[1:17:59] through and there he was with everything
[1:18:02] on him and he's praying and he's saying
[1:18:04] Lord let this cup pass from
[1:18:08] me but thy will be
[1:18:12] done you think well brother Daniel he uh
[1:18:18] he was the son of
[1:18:20] God he should have
[1:18:23] known he should have known what was
[1:18:26] prophesied about him he should have
[1:18:27] known his role in these things that's
[1:18:30] why maybe it wasn't so hard for him it
[1:18:33] was hard for him think about you I'm G
[1:18:36] to ask the church here something how
[1:18:39] many people here and I want you to raise
[1:18:41] your hand if this is true how many
[1:18:44] people
[1:18:45] here believe that Jesus Christ is their
[1:18:50] Savior and how many people here are
[1:18:53] Christians
[1:18:56] amen don't raise your hand on this next
[1:19:02] question so if you are really
[1:19:05] Christians the Bible says I believe is
[1:19:08] brother ly did you read Mark yeah
[1:19:11] brother Lyall read Mark at the end there
[1:19:15] and when Jesus is giving his disciples
[1:19:18] his people he says if you believe on me
[1:19:21] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:19:24] and then in mark 16 he said they shall
[1:19:26] cast out
[1:19:27] demons they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:19:30] and they shall
[1:19:31] recover so if that's the case then why
[1:19:35] do we fear when we get diagnosed with
[1:19:38] cancer
[1:19:39] wow why is that there anxiety there why
[1:19:43] do we fear if we're diagnosed with heart
[1:19:45] disease what says right here there's a
[1:19:47] prophecy right here for me and I just
[1:19:50] gra why shouldn't I just be healed well
[1:19:52] here's Jesus the same way and he's like
[1:19:54] he's like yeah I
[1:19:56] know I know what's prophesied of me but
[1:20:00] do you think the enemy wasn't there
[1:20:02] every every gun in hell was pointed at
[1:20:06] him you think that the enemy wasn't
[1:20:09] coming in saying maybe you got the
[1:20:10] prophecy
[1:20:11] wrong maybe maybe you're not this or or
[1:20:15] all of this this confusion comes in our
[1:20:19] mind if we don't have enough Faith to be
[1:20:22] healed how could we ever say that Jes
[1:20:24] Jesus
[1:20:26] knew he was the Messiah so it should
[1:20:28] have been easy for him it was not
[1:20:32] easy he knew how it was to
[1:20:37] suffer and then we worry about our kids
[1:20:39] like like I have like many of you have
[1:20:43] St John chapter 14 verse1 14 says ask
[1:20:47] anything Jesus speaking talking to us he
[1:20:50] says ask anything in my name and I'll do
[1:20:53] it yet we struggle we worry about our
[1:20:59] children it's a time of suffering but
[1:21:02] there's a time when you when you finally
[1:21:04] you get so low and you just cry out say
[1:21:06] Lord I don't care I just want your will
[1:21:08] I just want you I just want to be I just
[1:21:11] want to be what you want me to be I want
[1:21:13] to do what you want and there was Jesus
[1:21:15] in The Garden of the Gethsemane saying
[1:21:17] Lord whatever your will be
[1:21:20] done and then he gets up and here it
[1:21:23] comes
[1:21:25] the people to take him
[1:21:27] away they take him as you know to be
[1:21:31] tried and
[1:21:34] beaten all of his friends that
[1:21:37] night you know the ones that we rever so
[1:21:40] highly Peter and James and John they all
[1:21:43] ran
[1:21:45] away they all forsook him every want
[1:21:47] which fulfilled
[1:21:49] scripture and here's
[1:21:52] Peter and he just he just told him at
[1:21:55] the Last Supper Lord I will never
[1:21:57] forsake you I will never do it and and
[1:21:59] Jesus said you're going to do it three
[1:22:01] times before the next morning Peter you
[1:22:04] going to do
[1:22:06] it before the rooster craws and here's
[1:22:08] Peter and now the the Lord's taken away
[1:22:11] and they was surely thinking that he
[1:22:12] could save himself and somebody asked
[1:22:15] him do you know him and he was afraid he
[1:22:16] said no I don't even know the
[1:22:19] guy when this
[1:22:21] book when these gospels were written you
[1:22:24] notice one of the most beautiful things
[1:22:28] about the Bible is they record their
[1:22:31] mistakes wow they record their own
[1:22:35] failures and here read out of the Book
[1:22:38] of Luke and here's here's Jesus or
[1:22:41] here's here's Peter and he's probably
[1:22:43] telling Luke here's what happened that
[1:22:45] night I cut off the guy's
[1:22:48] ear I ran away from him and then I I
[1:22:51] forsook him three times they kept asking
[1:22:53] me I forsook
[1:22:55] him and then the last time not only when
[1:22:59] somebody asked me not only did I say I
[1:23:01] didn't know him I started cussing and
[1:23:03] then you know what
[1:23:05] happened there a far
[1:23:08] off Jesus looked
[1:23:11] over caught Peter's eye and Peter just
[1:23:16] was destroyed he started weeping and he
[1:23:18] he ran off crying the lowest time for
[1:23:22] Peter the lowest time for all of these
[1:23:25] people then Jesus is put up on the cross
[1:23:28] here he is stand up there nailed to the
[1:23:32] cross still this man he's still getting
[1:23:35] lower he didn't even reach the lowest
[1:23:38] yet and the disciples as I said they
[1:23:41] were giving their testimonies
[1:23:44] later maybe Luke was writing them down
[1:23:47] and Peter maybe said yeah I was one of
[1:23:49] the ones with with that was with
[1:23:52] Jesus oh you were the one one of the
[1:23:54] ones that stood a far
[1:23:56] off you were one of the ones that that
[1:24:00] were far away from him they didn't have
[1:24:03] enough courage to be with him yeah that
[1:24:06] was me it was a low
[1:24:10] time so there's Jesus up on the cross
[1:24:14] and there is a man that was crucified
[1:24:17] next to
[1:24:19] him that said
[1:24:23] Lord I'm mercy on
[1:24:26] me he tells the other one he says he
[1:24:29] doesn't deserve to be here you and I
[1:24:31] deserve to be here and Jesus said this
[1:24:34] day you will be with me in Paradise what
[1:24:36] was the greatest day in that thief in
[1:24:41] that criminal's
[1:24:43] life it was his lowest day wow it was
[1:24:46] the day that he was crucified it was the
[1:24:49] day that he was suffering that was his
[1:24:51] greatest
[1:24:53] day and it's our greatest times or when
[1:24:58] we're suffering because that is the time
[1:25:00] that we can speak to
[1:25:07] Jesus we
[1:25:09] were when Jesus died and he he got got
[1:25:13] to his lowest and it was his greatest
[1:25:15] achievement he conquered death Hell In
[1:25:17] The Grave right there he conquered all
[1:25:20] sin right there when he died who could
[1:25:23] say
[1:25:25] that I Lay My Life down many of us could
[1:25:27] say that brother Leo we can't say I take
[1:25:29] it up again that was reserved for one
[1:25:32] man one man with the power to do it how
[1:25:36] could somebody be dead for three
[1:25:39] days and then have still the power to
[1:25:43] take his own life to raise his own life
[1:25:45] up so here's
[1:25:48] Jesus he
[1:25:51] dies
[1:25:52] and all the
[1:25:55] disciples they
[1:25:58] they they they run away and and they're
[1:26:01] sad and and they don't know what to do
[1:26:04] and they had already forsaken him really
[1:26:06] the lowest the lowest point in their
[1:26:09] entire lives and then they start
[1:26:11] questioning he couldn't have been the
[1:26:13] Messiah I saw him
[1:26:16] die well yeah but didn't he say that he
[1:26:19] would raise again so easy easy for us to
[1:26:22] forget the promises of God
[1:26:25] we might not forget them like St John
[1:26:27] 14:14 ask anything in my name I'll do it
[1:26:30] but we just don't think that he's going
[1:26:32] to do
[1:26:33] it and here are these
[1:26:35] disciples
[1:26:36] struggling going through and
[1:26:40] and Jesus is put in the
[1:26:44] Tomb
[1:26:46] they the disciples go back and and and
[1:26:49] and
[1:26:50] they're don't know what to do they're
[1:26:53] afraid
[1:26:56] Saturday was a a
[1:26:58] very very difficult
[1:27:00] day let's let's
[1:27:04] read Luke
[1:27:13] 23 I want to read about that man that
[1:27:15] was on the cross verse we'll start with
[1:27:17] verse 42 for time
[1:27:21] sake and he said unto Jesus Jesus Lord
[1:27:24] remember me when thou comest into thy
[1:27:27] kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I
[1:27:29] say unto thee today Thou shalt be be
[1:27:31] with me in paradise and it was about the
[1:27:33] sixth hour of the day and there was
[1:27:34] Darkness all over the Earth until the N
[1:27:36] 9th hour and the sun was darkened and
[1:27:38] the veil of the temple was rent in the
[1:27:43] midst and when Jesus cried with a loud
[1:27:45] voice he said father into thy hands I
[1:27:48] Comm in my spirit and having thus said
[1:27:51] he gave up the ghost so when Jesus died
[1:27:55] over in the temple there was a
[1:27:59] curtain and this curtain inside the
[1:28:01] temple was in this area that only the
[1:28:04] high priest could go one time a
[1:28:07] year and then that high priest when he
[1:28:10] went in there he would make a sacrifice
[1:28:12] and atone for the sins of the people and
[1:28:15] then the presence of God would come in
[1:28:18] to that area into that holiest of
[1:28:21] holies was covered with a curtain thick
[1:28:26] heavy curtain and when Jesus died on the
[1:28:29] cross that curtain was ripped from the
[1:28:33] top to the bottom top to the bottom if
[1:28:37] you would have if it would have RI
[1:28:38] ripped from the bottom to the top any of
[1:28:40] us could grabbed it and maybe ripped it
[1:28:43] but it was God that broke that curtain
[1:28:46] think about that curtain how long was
[1:28:49] that curtain in the temple we don't know
[1:28:51] it could have been new it could have
[1:28:53] been there a year it could have been
[1:28:54] there for a hundred years we don't know
[1:28:56] how long that curtain was covering that
[1:28:59] holiest of holies but that curtain the
[1:29:02] greatest day of that curtain's
[1:29:05] life was when it was ripped
[1:29:09] in wow and it's the greatest day of our
[1:29:12] life when we are ripped into and we
[1:29:15] finally surrender to the Lord
[1:29:19] Jesus
[1:29:21] then after Jesus had died
[1:29:26] Joseph Vera got his body and he wrapped
[1:29:30] it and another man that came to Jesus by
[1:29:33] night this guy
[1:29:35] Nicodemus he uh didn't really want
[1:29:37] everybody to see he was a he was a a
[1:29:39] priest he didn't want everybody want to
[1:29:40] see was associated with Jesus but he
[1:29:43] came with Joseph of arthea because he
[1:29:45] Joseph couldn't have done it by himself
[1:29:46] so he takes this body and they wrap it
[1:29:48] up and I think probably the sisters were
[1:29:52] watching and
[1:29:54] I'm like
[1:29:55] yeah maybe they didn't do such a good
[1:29:58] job when they wrapped up Jesus so when
[1:30:01] they saw that then the sisters that same
[1:30:05] day on
[1:30:06] Friday remember the the Sabbath starts
[1:30:09] at sundown they went and they got a
[1:30:12] bunch of ointment and spices and they
[1:30:14] got it together and then they were going
[1:30:16] to
[1:30:17] go on the first day of the week and they
[1:30:20] were going to do it again they were
[1:30:23] going to embalm this Jesus with the
[1:30:26] spices so he's put in the grave he's
[1:30:29] there all day
[1:30:32] Saturday and then on Sunday morning as
[1:30:35] you saw the
[1:30:36] play The Sisters go to the tomb and and
[1:30:40] he's not there they go and tell the
[1:30:42] disciples Peter and John they run back
[1:30:45] and they they look in they look in there
[1:30:47] and he's they like he's gone he's not
[1:30:50] there Mary Magdalene was probably saying
[1:30:53] Hey listen
[1:30:54] he is
[1:30:55] risen the Bible says it was like idle
[1:30:58] Tales to them like what he's risen it's
[1:31:03] like guys he said he was GNA
[1:31:06] rise Mary believed
[1:31:09] it but so these brothers are like I just
[1:31:12] I can't I can't I can't
[1:31:15] really like digest all of this they were
[1:31:22] down Luke chap 2 24 verse 13 so while
[1:31:27] those disciples were talking about
[1:31:29] things a couple of them a couple of
[1:31:31] followers of Jesus they go on the road
[1:31:33] and they're walking to EMAs this town
[1:31:36] that's right really close there to
[1:31:39] Jerusalem and
[1:31:41] behold two of them went that same day to
[1:31:44] a village called theas which is from
[1:31:47] Jerusalem about three score furlongs and
[1:31:49] they talked together of all things which
[1:31:51] had happened and it came to pass that
[1:31:53] while they communed together and
[1:31:55] reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and
[1:31:57] went with
[1:31:58] them but their eyes were Holden they
[1:32:02] shouldn't that they should not know
[1:32:04] him and he said unto them what manner of
[1:32:06] communications are these that ye have
[1:32:09] one to another as you walk and are sad
[1:32:12] and one of them whose name was Copus
[1:32:14] answered and said unto him art thou only
[1:32:16] a stranger in Jerusalem and hast thou
[1:32:18] Hast not known the things which are come
[1:32:21] to pass in these days and he said said
[1:32:24] unto them what things and they said unto
[1:32:26] him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which
[1:32:29] was a prophet Mighty indeed and the word
[1:32:32] before and mighty indeed and word before
[1:32:35] God and all the people and how the chief
[1:32:37] priests and the rulers they delivered
[1:32:39] him to be condemned to death and have
[1:32:42] crucified
[1:32:43] him but we
[1:32:46] trusted that it had been he which should
[1:32:49] have redeemed
[1:32:51] Israel beside all this today is the
[1:32:53] third day since these things were done
[1:32:56] we thought he was Messiah but we were
[1:32:59] wrong he wasn't because he
[1:33:03] died yay and certain women also of our
[1:33:07] company made us astonished which were
[1:33:10] early at the supplier so this morning
[1:33:13] these sisters were up there and when
[1:33:15] they found not his body they came saying
[1:33:17] that they had also seen a vision of
[1:33:20] angels which said that he was
[1:33:22] alive and a certain and certain of them
[1:33:26] which were with us went to the
[1:33:29] supplier and found it even as the women
[1:33:32] had
[1:33:33] said but him they saw
[1:33:36] not then he said unto them oh fools and
[1:33:40] slow of heart to believe all that the
[1:33:42] prophets have
[1:33:43] spoken he
[1:33:45] said you don't remember what he
[1:33:50] said you don't remember the promises
[1:33:53] that he gave
[1:33:56] gave ought not Christ to have suffered
[1:33:58] these things and to enter into his glory
[1:34:01] and then the spirit started to build
[1:34:03] they started to hear the word of God and
[1:34:06] they started to apply it to their lives
[1:34:08] ought not Christ to have suffered these
[1:34:10] things and to enter into his glory and
[1:34:13] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[1:34:15] he expounded unto them all in all the
[1:34:17] scriptures the things concerning
[1:34:22] himself and they drew nigh to the
[1:34:25] village where whether they went and he
[1:34:27] made as though he would have gone
[1:34:29] further but they constrained him saying
[1:34:31] abide with us like wow this guy is
[1:34:35] awesome he's
[1:34:37] special they didn't recognize him
[1:34:40] yet for it is toward evening and the day
[1:34:43] is far spent and he went in to tr with
[1:34:46] them and it came to pass as he sat at
[1:34:48] meat with them he took bread and blessed
[1:34:51] it and break and gave it to them and
[1:34:53] they eyes were
[1:34:55] open and they knew him and he vanished
[1:34:58] out of their sight and they said one to
[1:35:01] another did not our heart burn within us
[1:35:05] while he talked with us by the way and
[1:35:07] while he opened to us the
[1:35:10] scriptures at the lowest point in these
[1:35:13] brothers
[1:35:14] lives they were
[1:35:17] wrong we thought he was Christ we
[1:35:20] thought he was Messiah we thought he was
[1:35:22] all these great things we saw do these
[1:35:24] Miracles maybe he was just a
[1:35:26] prophet maybe he was just a good man
[1:35:28] maybe he was just maybe we were all
[1:35:30] wrong about this no Copus you weren't
[1:35:34] wrong he promised these things you just
[1:35:37] had to get really low before God could
[1:35:41] really speak to
[1:35:45] you then Jesus
[1:35:49] said he told his disciples he made a
[1:35:52] very strange statement he said take up
[1:35:54] your cross and follow
[1:35:58] me these things that I've
[1:36:01] suffered now you suffer
[1:36:03] them if you stand for me you're going to
[1:36:06] be hated so when we get down when we get
[1:36:09] low and it seems like things are just
[1:36:12] going so
[1:36:14] wrong no that's the time that God
[1:36:19] speaks and it's sad it's sad that the
[1:36:22] only time that he can speak in a human
[1:36:24] being's life is when he is so low that
[1:36:27] he just completely has nowhere else to
[1:36:31] go there was another guy I was
[1:36:35] witnessing
[1:36:37] to
[1:36:41] and he just wouldn't I was he's like oh
[1:36:45] you're you're you're wonderful and
[1:36:47] you're great and and I love all of this
[1:36:49] and and everything that you've said me
[1:36:50] it's it's such a blessing told me it's
[1:36:52] such a blessing from the Lord and and
[1:36:54] all and everything's just so
[1:36:58] good
[1:36:59] and then when he got what he needed I
[1:37:04] haven't talked to him since he just
[1:37:07] left just lip service he wasn't low
[1:37:12] enough but when you get so low that you
[1:37:15] have nowhere else to go
[1:37:17] then everything changes imagine that
[1:37:20] thief on the cross his worst day in his
[1:37:23] life life was his greatest literally it
[1:37:25] was greater than the day he was born as
[1:37:28] the proverb said that torn
[1:37:31] Veil the greatest day in that curtain
[1:37:35] was the day that it was ripped in half
[1:37:37] and torn
[1:37:38] up what was Jesus's greatest
[1:37:41] day wasn't Palm
[1:37:44] Sunday when everyone was singing his
[1:37:47] praises and everything was good it was
[1:37:49] when he bowed his head he said father
[1:37:51] into thy hands I commit my spirit the
[1:37:54] greatest day is my greatest
[1:37:58] day because that's the day that all my
[1:38:00] sins wiped
[1:38:04] away there was a a young
[1:38:08] brother that uh he's a good friend I
[1:38:10] haven't talked with him in a while but
[1:38:11] he's he's a good friend wasn't living
[1:38:13] for the Lord he was 20 in his
[1:38:17] 20s and he's just drinking partying
[1:38:22] doing what kids do sometimes and and he
[1:38:26] was just going down the wrong
[1:38:29] road and had this this girlfriend and
[1:38:34] and they were just there there wasn't
[1:38:36] there wasn't much to
[1:38:38] them but he got invited to a youth
[1:38:42] meeting and in this youth meeting the
[1:38:46] Lord started dealing with the young
[1:38:49] man and they were up at the altar and
[1:38:53] they were they were worshiping brother
[1:38:56] Josiah the musicians can make your way
[1:38:58] up they were they were worshiping and
[1:39:01] and he felt there was a call that was
[1:39:04] something was pulling on him and he was
[1:39:06] he didn't have a job he he was like I
[1:39:08] said he was he was doing drugs and and
[1:39:10] drinking and everything was just really
[1:39:12] bad in his
[1:39:14] life but there was something pulling on
[1:39:17] this young
[1:39:19] man came to the
[1:39:21] Altar and he was
[1:39:24] praying all the young people were up
[1:39:26] there and they were all weeping and and
[1:39:28] he was just just just everything was
[1:39:30] coming out and he was repenting and and
[1:39:32] he was crying on his sleeve of his suit
[1:39:35] of his new suit that he had
[1:39:37] bought and he kept wiping himself and
[1:39:41] and and praying and something inside of
[1:39:44] him said raise your hand up to the Lord
[1:39:47] and he looked down at his sleeve and
[1:39:50] there was snot and everything all over
[1:39:53] his sleeve he says I can't raise my hand
[1:39:57] I'm embarrassed everybody will see
[1:39:59] what's what's on on
[1:40:02] this he kept praying and something said
[1:40:05] raise your hand doesn't matter what
[1:40:08] everybody thinks of
[1:40:10] you he raised his
[1:40:12] hand and the Holy Spirit came down and
[1:40:15] filled the young
[1:40:17] man changed his life and he never went
[1:40:21] back from that point and then he went
[1:40:24] and led that young lady to the Lord now
[1:40:27] they're married have a beautiful
[1:40:31] family he was influencer on my son
[1:40:35] Daniel and his
[1:40:38] guitar he's a really great guy that a
[1:40:42] lot of the kids would look up to and he
[1:40:44] he when he changed then he was able to
[1:40:46] give something back to the
[1:40:49] youth he
[1:40:51] helped my son
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:55] that day at the altar when he was as low
[1:40:58] as he could be then he was able to make
[1:41:00] a choice that was the best day for
[1:41:03] him this man that's this young man
[1:41:05] that's in jail right now let me tell you
[1:41:08] this is his greatest
[1:41:10] day he's in the he's in the cell right
[1:41:13] now what is he thinking about he's
[1:41:15] probably thinking about a resurrected
[1:41:16] Lord Jesus he's probably thinking about
[1:41:19] our conversation from a couple days ago
[1:41:22] where I told this is your greatest
[1:41:25] day this is the day that God's going to
[1:41:27] deal with
[1:41:29] you so why is Easter important to us why
[1:41:32] is the crucifixion
[1:41:34] important when Jesus said take up your
[1:41:37] cross look what I have done as a sister
[1:41:42] saying now you go do the same brothers
[1:41:47] and sisters none of us we have problems
[1:41:50] those problems are a blessing but none
[1:41:52] of us has stooped as low or hit as Rock
[1:41:55] Bottom as Jesus Christ did he knows what
[1:41:58] we go
[1:42:00] through if it's a
[1:42:02] child if it's a
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:06] job if it's an attitude if it's a
[1:42:11] religion if it's a
[1:42:14] denomination if it's a judgmental
[1:42:20] Spirit he's he humbled me
[1:42:24] he humbled my
[1:42:25] wife with my kids to the point where we
[1:42:28] said Lord I don't
[1:42:30] care I don't care what it is I need you
[1:42:36] God I need
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:41] you we need
[1:42:44] him but he went through
[1:42:47] it he suffered and he died so that we
[1:42:51] might live

[1:42:57] sisters if things are going good if you
[1:43:00] think everything's okay fall down on
[1:43:03] your
[1:43:04] knees and thank God for his goodness and
[1:43:08] surrender your life to him as I said it
[1:43:12] might be sin but sin comes in many many
[1:43:15] different
[1:43:17] forms sin very very plainly comes in
[1:43:21] self-righteousness s sin very very often
[1:43:25] comes in judgmental

[1:46:21] a sinner my whole life and I I am ready
[1:46:23] to give my life to Jesus
[1:46:27] Christ brothers and sisters not just to
[1:46:31] go to heaven but because he is
[1:46:35] worthy he died he went through all of
[1:46:38] that if for no one
[1:46:40] else he went through it for
[1:46:42] me Daniel Evans he went through this for
[1:46:48] and I will love him for my whole life
[1:46:49] because he did it and I will preach him
[1:46:53] and I will lift him up I will give him
[1:46:55] my
[1:46:56] life and it's him and him
[1:47:01] alone any Minister that's worth anything
[1:47:04] will point to Jesus
[1:47:06] Christ and this
[1:47:09] Easter brothers and sisters if there is
[1:47:12] something in your
[1:47:15] life that you want to get rid of if
[1:47:17] there is if there is a dedication that
[1:47:20] that you want to
[1:47:21] make
[1:47:23] and you are welcome to come here at this
[1:47:26] Altar and make that
[1:47:29] choice and I would suggest that you do
[1:47:32] it if you haven't done
[1:47:34] it Jesus Christ is
[1:47:38] alive the Easter not only celebrates his
[1:47:42] resurrection but Easter celebrates his
[1:47:45] suffering and his
[1:47:47] death and he did it for me and he did it
[1:47:50] for
[1:47:51] you
[1:47:53] now the least that we can do is give him
[1:47:55] our lives let's all
