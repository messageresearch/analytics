there there were no written or called in prayer requests I'm sure there are some needs yes as we bow our heads to pray before we minister will consider we remember those who would have a need the Lord as we we've gathered today in that precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus and you are the light if we're walking in you and you're in us you are that light it's not a light that we manufacture but Jesus is the light of the Father you know the needs that are out there you know whatever they might be Lord every day we're a needy people are to me we need more of you Lord and there's more of you to be Hance the Lord would you minister to any of those or who at this time Lord maybe they're in their home maybe traveling maybe some working wherever they might be today and they're crying out or is it with a need or something would you minister to them Lord and as we Minister the word Lord trusting that it would be you would put the words and you would anoint them in us Lord to minister Lord to those where we have need of you Lord and we know you are the word made life today or become that life that Living Word in us today Lord father we ask it in Jesus Christ we love 4:8 thank you sister amen it's good to think it's good to be in the house of the Lord again this evening and those of you wherever you're gathered today and may that be that place that excited and dedicated this evening and always a place that God is welcome in your home in your vehicle wherever you might be never never a place that God would feel unwelcome but he'll always be welcome there so just appreciate the goodness of the Lord in His grace as we as you hear the news and you read this and you hear that and you just know that God is mindful us and he's in charge of it all and we don't have to fear where God is there is light there is no darkness so and we'll walk in that light and I'd like to read them open up with this scripture found in Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 5 it says where the thoughts started with this scripture it says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations and that was a word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah and as I read it and I thought about and I said you know that's for us to also you may be seated those standing here to church are standing at home and as I read that scripture and I was looking at it and I realized that was not only to Jeremiah but each one was known by God when you were formed before he even came out of the womb you were known by God and it might be a strange thought to some that they would think that but he's the eternal one he dwells an eternity and if you were part of God now you were always part of God and so as I spoke to brother Matt on Monday morning we usually do spend a little I'm just going to reviewing the past week and what we're looking forward in in plans for this week and I had several thoughts that had been you know just in my mind and which way to go and his brother Matt ministered I felt this would be the way to go and we shared some things but to know that he knew us and he loved us anyways but he loves his own so as I was looking at this and just the different thoughts that came with and I began to look at there's so many scriptures in the Bible that testify to this that God already knew and and brother Branham says and there's quite a few quotes in you could bring so I chose a few of them but God knew you he even knew your name and we'll show that to some of the scriptures but let's let's take this first quote take him from the message speak to the mountain and he says you say if I knew there was a scripture that pertained to me like that I believe I could have the same faith well my beloved friends every divine promise in the Bible belongs to you and it's just as essential to you as it was to him he says you find one and he was speaking of Abraham there you find one promise here that God has made and all the heavens and earth will pass away before that promise would ever fail to act in your stead because it is to the believer God has given these promises to them that belief and if you have that seat of God in you you are a believer you know and you say well how can that be how could we know every see brings forth of its kind and and based on the scripture and based on the time that we're living this is manifestation time so seeds are bringing forth of their kind so you say well you know my faith is little but it is faith and if you have the faith of a mustard seed you could speak to this mountain and it'll move and brother branham in this semester's speak to this mountain he says this is when you lose it or this is where you lose it when you get up and you spoke to the mountain and you look out the window at the mountain and it doesn't seem to have moved in yourself and he said you lose it right there but he said one grain of sand has moved already and it has began to happen he said then you stand on that and watch how it happens to go so in and say well how does that tie in every scripture pertains to you you're a child of God so from the message identification he says if he is a redeemer he come to redeem become a redeem as to pick up that which has fallen to redeem back to a place where it was at the beginning so none of none will be picked up but what was but them that was with him his thoughts at the beginning now you didn't choose this he chose us you know and he looked back in it and in the scripture that says and and when Abraham was meeting Melchizedek and I've been in his own grandchildren it was the tithe paid where a tribute him because they were in that vintage so again you say well hey I'm not worthy or I'm not good in if it doesn't speak of that and speaks of he thought of you you were part of him and as you go especially later in the messages you start as I was going through looking at these quotes in the beginning brother Branham is making reference to but he said now we are becoming the sons of God but later on as he begins to unveil he because know you were a son of God already the answer realize that you don't work up you don't earn up to that you were a son of God but it's a manifestation time now and it begins as you see as we go to and then in questions and answers look he never went in got dirt and made Eve but he made from the original dirt he took a rib from his side and made him a helpmate that was Eve she was made for the man and part of the men she was part of him in the beginning in the creation in a theophany she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided in another creation she had to be made in the same creation so he's speaking in a spiritual sense there he's talking about this had him in this Eve today the second Adam and this Eve that will not fall she's part of him and I know and I've I've seen over the years you've heard and people get to a point and begin to manifest the wrong spirit with that they begin to get proud in themselves they begin to lift themselves up they begin to say things and act in a way that it's contrary to the Spirit of Christ because you're part of him so you have to you would have the same response the same thing and you know and and I do remember there was a situation of a church and the minister was speaking and their windows were open it was a small Church and there was it was right in the middle of a neighborhood and he was speaking and and he's he addresses congregation he was talking to them saying you know you're the bride you're the chosen you're the elect therefore you don't have to treat your neighbors right you don't have to he began to tell them they have nothing to do with the neighbors and begin to put it in a position that we don't belong because that was not Jesus Christ spirit he even cried out Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing if it is possible that's the Spirit of Christ and as I was looking into this and I was sitting down them listening to the brother Matt in the office there Sunday morning and I said Lord you already know what's in my heart and brother Matt's going in this direction right now and I said but what about that spirit and I'll just identify as some of title they call it bride pride as if we made ourselves but we did it make else he did and brother Matt then there at this there at the end of sermon began to talk of having the Spirit of Christ and how it would manifest itself so I said Lord you you have everything but I just I want to I want to just show you this and I don't know that I've ever approached this subject this way but I just felt the Lord began to show me some things here and trusting that that I can deliver it that way in broken cisterns the next quote there I believe it was and I watch rubella Bram says that if I had to if I would have known before there was a world when we were Souls a part of God that we are for we were with him before the foundation of the world because there's only one form of eternal life and that's God and we're a part of him we was not so much that we would know and could think and had a being but we were in his thoughts of what we were before the foundation of the world because we are part of him like my son is part of me and I am part of my father and so forth we are sons and daughters of God can we move that up a little bit there by his foreknowledge and back there if I could have known as I know now and could have looked over the whole span of time and he would have said to me what time do you want to live I'd have said this time right now just the eve or the ending of the world history and the uncommon coming of the kingdom of God to be established in the earth I think it's a most glorious time of all ages is right now but God put you here there were those even the scripture tell us they longed to see this day but God put you here for a reason from the message in absolute and I can see eternity break and come down into time since eat and when it did there come a line of blood all the way up unto of Calvary and from Calvary tied with this lining goes on to the post Jesus and some day when he comes to claim his own everyone that's tied to the ultimate will be raised up into eternity why they have been in eternity all the time they were predestinated to attorney return 'ti they are part of God they were in his thinking at the beginning my brother branham begins to a defy you were a thought in his mind and and I know that these aren't strange and new scriptures or quotes to you but it just like to with I think we have two more of them to read them who do you say this is just notice how if you recognize him to be the anointed word of that day see God in the beginning being infinite and know all things from the beginning and the only thing that these things are is the display of his attributes and attribute you have an attribute it's your thought you think of something then you speak it then you take it that's God he in the beginning if if ever if you ever was or ever will be in heaven you wasn't heaven to start with you're part of God you were his thought he knew your name he knew who you were before you there ever was a molecule before there ever was a light and before there was anything he knew you and your name he put it in the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was ever formed see you were his thought and then you became a word and a word is a thought expressed and there you are manifested and he does know your name he knows who you are he can call you by name and as I was reading some of this I just I was there just kind of going over some of these thoughts and anything and brother branham would be in that prayer line and the the the different folks coming up to be prayed for and and you know brother Branham couldn't do this on his own he would say you know what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for that angel and then he would say he's here and then he would begin to speak anyway say now wait a minute in case you're from this place you were here and he began to tell him anyway say now your name is and he would tell them their name who was telling him that the angel of the Lord was telling him that it shows he knows exactly who we are and where we come from where we've been he knows the end from the beginning the beginning from the end everything is covered there and then the last one Christ is revealed in his own word the last quote there now the same thing is this if you're a son of God and if I am a son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning and when Jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him jerm form life form seed form and when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he arose from the dead we rose with him and now since we have recognized it now we set together with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus see we if we are sons and daughters of God we are God's children we are attributes of God so then we we we got eternal life and God is the only eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word then we were part of him then Amen there you are that's in there there is no devil no power no nothing can ever move it that's the type host of the soul you have to understand you're not doing this on your own it was God that did all the work and you can anchor on it because he never fails he said if the Sun comes up every morning and he in he tells exactly what we see every day he said you know my word will never fail and he said you were part of it and and so it it was encouraging to me as I when I read this scripture that's what started the thought of Jeremiah and I said than you knew me also you already knew my name you knew you knew my ups and downs of my life yet you still you didn't say no can't use that one can't do that one you knew every situation you knew everything that would happen and you chose me it was in your thoughts nothing that I had to do but he did and I'm thankful for that but something in me responds back to that and brother branham said that's that attribute of God in you you know you could be somewhere else you could be in another and in another religion in another group something else you know one day beam up and the next day being down one day being saved the next day being lost but God's children know where they stand and now David said in Psalms 138 verse 8 the Lord will perfect or accomplish complete that which concern a--the me God will perfect bring to perfection bring to an end bring to a full accomplishment that which concerns me thy mercy O Lord endures forever forsake not the work of thine own hands David said don't I'm the work of your hands don't forsake me it's not my own works it's not my own ability and as as brother Peter was leading the song service and I just quieted myself down and I was kneeling down there and just talking to the Lord and each one of us you know yourself and you know your shortcomings you know your strong points brother Bram says each one of us has a weak point and we know we have to learn to defend that and in life and all and we're going and I was just talking to the Lord I said help me to get out of the way help me to just deliver these thoughts and brother Peter begins to say heal me O Lord and I shall be healed I said thank you Lord you're listening and and maybe to nobody else but to me just lord knows I'm just trying to say Lord I just want to get out of my way just I want nothing Lord let this be you this speaks and so God just shows us in little ways sometimes in great ways and a simple thing here whatever it is that he's mindful of us Philippians 1:6 Paul says this in Philippians being confident or assured it's a certainty of this very thing that he he which have begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ he the began of that good work is not going to leave it half done sometimes you you go by maybe a construction site or you go by and you watch this houses have been sitting there you drive by it two years five years ten years it never went beyond that point in fact it's falling in decay or or a subdivision that they started and I know there's one by our house that one builder started and there was like ten houses there and then the rest of the lot set vacant overgrown with with shrubs and weeds and all they weren't able to complete it they weren't able to finish it somebody else then had to come in and do it down time but it's had vacant for a long time somebody didn't count the cost somebody didn't look and say am I able to but God counted the cost he knew what it would cost him and he said I'm willing to go and pay the full price for it because I want to express those thoughts those attributes that were in me so they brought to brought me to this point and I don't know how far we'll get along today I'll try not to be too long but Isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 and in one that we we all know very well Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel Isaiah I mean Jerry Yan Isaiah he gives this God gives this promise and it's recorded in the book Isaiah a son to a virgin his name he didn't say a child shall be worn to someone down the road and we'll see what they named him it is very specific behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel now we go from there and and you know we've heard you you think about it at different different ministers that are ministered it and talked about it when that promise is given and and the congregation the people there believed that seeing God fulfilled the word of the prophets and and you know people began to prepare and make ready for a virgin to conceive but he didn't say oh by the way this will be eight hundred years down the road he just gave the promise and brother branham says if we read that quote for brother Branham says if I would have had a choice and they told me I would choose this day because this is the fulfillment of the day because we have the opportunity and the privilege to read and know what this day is but then they all began to make preparation there's going to be a virgin but it had a time and a place so now we go to Luke chapter one and we'll look at verses 26 to 38 and as I thought about this and and and and begin to read the scripture here because this when I read Jeremiah then this was the next thought that came that promise and the fulfillment of it in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth and it stopped and I thought to myself you know angel didn't come down and Lord didn't say go down to go down to the planet Earth go find a virgin and tell her this he didn't come down and walk and knock on the door excuse me is there a virgin in this house I've got a promise to him but I don't know who it is no there was a he was specific he says a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph all the details are put in right there of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary it was very specific to one and just like he can call your name specifically we've shared those testimonies how God has done that it showed in the scripture actually called out a name we've seen it in the testimony we've seen it in the in the in reading and hearing the messages God knows exactly their home address what street they lived and he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever you're from this city you say I see you're not from here you're down kind of south from here in fact you're from this city and you live on this street and here's your address and your name is he's still the same yesterday today and forever so it's a Gabriel knew exactly where to go because God said these are the specifics verse 27 28 and the angel came unto her and said hail thou art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled had his saying and cast in her mind what manual manner of salutation should be this is not a standard greeting this is not what people come up and tell you this is you know maybe at the moment she didn't think of hope this is Isaiah when Isaiah said and caught her by surprise how many times did you hear when they would say and you would they would begin to cry that's exactly the truth that's right they couldn't deny it so it caught her it was strange to her it was it but she didn't say oh this can't be it was just different that's gone and the angel said unto her fear not Mary be at peace about it being arrested about it for those found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus Emmanuel God is with us and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father not only that but he told him where the lineage went back and where the throne was there was no there was no question about this and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for error forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end now watch there is a part for us to play oh well lord chose me oh right great no then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be seen I know not a man she has a question this is not how you have children this is not what happens how can this be she does have a question last two verses and the angel said answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God he says it's not gonna be of your ability it's not gonna be your work it's not anything that a man's gonna have to do it's God the Holy Ghost having overshadowing you and you know what it's the exact same thing today it's not of our ability it's us yielding to the Holy Ghost and letting him have his way and watch her answer here did I did I miss the one scripture be it unto me according to of it and behold thy cousin Elizabeth I'm I'm sorry I I think I go ahead back thirty Six's and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she have also conceived a son in her old age and this is a six month with her who was called barren he knows Elizabeth by name and he knows exactly what's going on with her and for with God nothing shall be impossible in God's Word never returns void and this is Mary's response and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her she had to make that a declaration of faith say be it unto me according there comes a time in your life whenever it is when you have to make that same choice lord I am that promise is mine be it unto me according to thy word and that's seed then that that that that that was implanted in her by the Holy Ghost begins to grow begins to form and and there is a time and and we know in a human it's it's about nine months it can vary a little bit but there is amount of time so there is a space of time a growth period could I put it that way of the manifestation of Christ in you there there is a growing a bringing to maturity of and brother Branham says in this age I would want to leave why because this is when the full manifestation of a child of God the Bride of Christ and again you say well how do you know that the scripture tells us when these things begin to happen when you begin to see the fulfillment of these things when these prophecies these events look up your Redemption draweth nigh this is the day we're looking at that now you would say well what a marvelous thing with Mary that God would know her and as she accepts it and and you know we know the history and the story of Mary she was raised there as a young lady in the temple she never went out into the world that is recorded well well of course she deserved it let's look at another one here let's go to Acts chapter 7 and we'll gonna go through chapters 7 8 9 parts of it we'll start first with 758 through 60 and this was when Steven was was being stoned and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at the young man's feet whose name was saw and they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying and they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep this is after acts 2:38 the spirit of Christ and Stephen says lay this not to their charge now you begin to see the attributes of Christ in a man of the Holy Ghost in a person but look saul was there and you and I would have looked at Saul and blamed this on him now wait a minute Saul consented to their death that's going to acts 8 1 2 4 and Saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the reasons of Judea and Samaria except the Apostles the church began to be scattered around he says and devout man carried Stephen to his a burial and made great lamentation over him not realizing that this was part of the plan of God you and I would have said hey this is all wrong but and force as for Saul he made havoc of the church entering into every house and Haley men and women committed them to prison you know when Satan knows someone is getting close and opening their heart he's going to turn everything he can against it and I can tell her this when we first heard the message I was a young man 14 15 years old and and we were still living in California the message just come we're listening to the tapes and we're and and it was it was an exciting time for us to to to hear something that was beyond the emotion of a Pentecost sure - when - then those those that had had come in the Pentecostal or should I say that the 40s 50s 60s like my parents and maybe some of your parents and and saw the reality of it when I got there I saw the entertainment of it I still remember that going to services and this was the move of the Holy Spirit and watch it become just an entertainment the music would start and all the young people sat in the first two or three rows and as soon as the music started and they had the drums all all the young people were jumping and shouting and they're screaming and yelling and as soon as the music started so did the dancing and I usually sat with our parents and I noticed it and then the minister would get to speaking and half of the young people would walk of church and they wouldn't stay in there until after and then the worship starting today come back in I caught the end of it the entertainment of it and when this message comes that we began to hear it begins to say this is what I've been longing for this is there's some reality in this and what an excitement so I remember dad he made he we had a three-car Garage and he made a little portion of it put some chairs so we could have Church in there and we received the message of the movie the deep call is to the deep and dad want to show so we invited our relatives we invited the neighbors and began to to watch Deep Ecology and there was a response from the some of the relatives and like wow this is absolutely amazing this is God and suddenly the door opens to the garage the light gets flicked on and the pastor of the church that we were attending comes in and he begins to scream and yell at us turns out turn that thing off that's of the devil and just totally opposes it well the shocked us all over here we are all you know and some of those folks that were there never came back never know because Satan will oppose the truth every time he's always tried to put a stop to it so here's salt okay and and and it scatters the people and it doesn't look like it's a work of God the people are scattered Sall is threatening he's having people committed to prison but we know the rest of the story let's go to chapter 9 therefore that we had already read that I believe chapter 9 and saw yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord went unto the high priests and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogue's that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound into Jerusalem Paul in his in his great what would you what's the word I'm looking for in his his zeal his want to crush this heresy because Paul says later in this way that's called heresy it's now the way I serve the Lord but to him it was an area I'm going to put a stop to this he says and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there was shined around him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and Paul Saul at this time still knowing the Scriptures because he knew the scriptures he knew the law as he tells you later on he says if you want to if you want to compare experiences of knowledge ability let me tell you of mine he knew the scriptures he knew what is it and he realizes this is God and he says who aren't though and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and heat timber trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do the same guy that just a minute ago five minutes ago whatever amount of time this experience was was on his way to get those Christians thrown into jail and and to death or what else now he says what will you me to do now you could read the whole story when when you know we won't go into all of it but when Paul comes back they're saying isn't this the same Paul that wrecked havoc with the children Christians the people were still very about it okay let's go on the next and the man were journeyed with him stood speechless hearing the voice but see no man this was to Paul and saw rose from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and he brought and brought him into Damascus he still went into Damascus as he was going and he was there three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias and the Lord had to him had the said the Lord in a vision and an eye as he said behold I am here Lord Ananias had already known the voice of God being being a man a prophet he knew that so here I am Lord this is you I know that and it should be in our lives to a place well that we know when God is speaking when God is calling us one and get our attention there we should say Here I am stop for a moment say Lord is that you know yeah let's go on come to the next yeah and they said and the Lord said unto Him arise and go into the street which is called straight again look at the details are and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus before behold he prayeth again I'm just I'm trying to show you how specific goddess he knows everything about it and he is he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight and then Ananias answered said Lord have you read the news lately have you been staying up-to-date with the news Lord do you know what's happening out there do you know who this Saul is and what he's done kind of like I sometimes lower where are you in this I think Lord that that that if you were in this it would be going in this direction it would be it wouldn't be so hard it wouldn't there's a reason for it I nice Ananias answered lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he had done to the Saints at Jerusalem to thy Saints and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call him thy name Lord are you aware of this but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me I know him by name I've called him a fact I called him I said Saul Saul he's a chosen vessel to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake the same one who just a couple days previous to that is attacking the Christians trying to destroy them God has st. him I've chose him and he's called to do this again I just want to show you Isaiah tells of a virgin to be conceived of origin conceiving and his name shall be called and is it and we look at Mary and we say well sure she was a holy child she was raised in the temple she never went out into the world she was raised in church and all she was worthy of it well then how do you explain Saul it's God's choosing it's God's doing it's not mine it's not yours it was not brother branham's choosing to be the prophet of this day it was God in the back of his mind although when we look at it now as brother Brown said I would have chosen if I got in the truth to live in this day to see the fulfillment all of this but God chose it that way just like God chose it that way for you now again we look at those things why brother branham why Oral Roberts why Billy Graham because God chose it that way each one playing their part when when Elohim comes down the three men come down and visit Abraham and why Abraham his father made idols that they weren't even Christians we could say they weren't believers but before the foundation of the world as brother Ram said in the back part of his mind in his thoughts he was there already because the scripture tell us before the foundation of the world he was slain to him all of that and if brother Branham says he was in eternity we know it in a block of time but he was an eternity and you were part of it so here we would wonder why brother Branham hawaii's man because God chose it that way why didn't he take this man he seemed to be an even brother branham when he walks through a Roberts University and he's looking at his grandeur and the splendor and all of it and brother Branham begins to say Lord you must have not had confidence in me you must have known that that I wouldn't be able to handle this wealth this beauty to me it's just given a little - I just got you know and he describes his is his living and and how they were raised and what he had and all so in his mind he's looking at himself and saying I couldn't have done this Lord you would know didn't have that confidence in me but you know what there was something greater than that because as it when he walks out and he steps out of that or Roberts University and the Lord tells him because I am your and that's exactly what I want to hear I am NOT this world's good not the popularity not to be well-known not to be no but he is my portion he is mine and I am his now if brother Branham would have had like he said the the education the study that he might have depended on some of that he might have looked at it Paul said I had to learn to let all of that go I had to count it as nothing but for a reason God allowed Paul do because Paul was going to write a lot of the New Testament so God allowed it to be to him to know the Scriptures and have the ability to do it but he didn't need that in this age these scriptures didn't have to be written again they were written already they were going to be demonstrated to be living to be the same yesterday he needed a man they could humble himself and surrender himself and yield himself and say Here I am Lord and I'm not trusting because I know I don't have the abilities to do these things and that's sometimes where we get into a little bit of trouble lord I prayed all night Lord I studied all night Lord I'd done this I'd done that and I'm not saying not to do that but don't depend on it you depend on the Lord to do what he says I know brother green used to tell us ministering wise he said study like there's no God and then come out depending on God like you never studied there's a big difference in agency so we see these two two opposites if I could put it that way here Saul and here's Mary both fulfilling the Word of God and he says I knew both of you I knew where to send the angel I knew where to meet you Paul I knew where to Santa Anna Ananias I knew where where you were going to be and I knew what you were gonna do and he's the same yesterday today and forever now let's look at first Peter 2:9 and I believe brother Jeremy had this put up here before service but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light you're chosen and it's not a eenie meenie miney mo I'll take one I'll take the odd numbers I'll take thee no you were part of him you were an expression of him I like this but you're a chosen raced a priesthood of a kingly lineage this is a holy nation of people belonging specially to God that you may make known the perfection of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous that I nu God will be made manifest perfected shown but you are an Electress a royal pre-hook priesthood a holy nation a people for God's own possession that ye may show forth the excellencies of him was called you out of darkness into his own Marvis li it's God's working you you got to put your name in there you've got to see that you're part of it you know and this is what Peter is saying you're a chosen generation and and and to each generation you could say this scripture to blame because to each generation they had a part to fulfill but there comes a time when it's all fulfilled and and he's and it's still the same yesterday and then Peter says in first Peter 1 verse 2 elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father brother Ram talks about predestination being foreknowledge not that he just decided well I'm gonna make a choice today I'm gonna take this one but I want to know it was foreknowledge he knew because he already had representation there he said elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied grace unto you he called your name out grace I don't know how many times you read the scripture and you see grace in there you say thank you Lord for grace you can take it personally I know when I read and I see my name in there I say thank you Lord my name is in there if I'm not any more smarter than that at least I can read my name in there but you know it is the grace of God his his own choosing as to it not to him that willeth but to whom God chooses here now let's look at how Paul deals with some of this here in Romans chapter 9 we'll go through 11 through 16 here and again for the children be not born not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth nothing you did to deserve to earn there was no could I say a thing we had to earn this you got to meet this standard in order to become a child of God no he said it's not it is by grace he said it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God said God for a bit no it's nothing to do with unrighteousness he says for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of God that show is Murthy and you know what I don't know who those are and you don't know though whose are you just need to make sure your calling and election is sure God doesn't have to make your calling and election sure he knows it it's not god that's wondering about you it's sometimes you wondering about yourself if I was really a son of God if I would did I wouldn't struggle I wouldn't go through this and we begin to look at ourselves that way and we might trouble ourselves don't get frustrated with ourselves because it seems like sometimes we run godly but the scripture tells us you make sure of your election you check it over you look at it closely God is sure of it it's just settling it in your own heart Lord I surrender all Lord I yield to you III do this not because I'm trying to merit your goodness not because I'm trying to merit salvation I do this because I want to show you that I love you and I care for you you know III refer to that quite often in a relationship especially through a husband and wife if we're still trying to merit the the affection and the love and and and should I say the respect and we've been married 20 30 or 40 years and we still haven't figured out how to do it I would say that relationships not doing too good but a relationship after it's began to build and to begin he didn't you know you learn it it's a learning process it's an experience you go through but a time comes in their relationship that it's based on the love for one another that's the motive behind it all I do this because I want her to be happy I do this because it pleases her I do this because I love her not because if I don't do it she's going to be mad at me or it's the same way with God I'm not doing this to try to please you so you won't be mad at me Lord I'm doing this because I love you you've already showed your love to me you already gave your life you gave your all for me I just want to give my all back for you because I want that relationship with you it's the same way he said to do him God show as a mercy Colossians 3:12 there 17 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness and long-suffering who is Paul describing right there none other than Jesus that's describing him bowels of mercy kindness humbleness of my meekness long-suffering he says put on others put on Christ receive him receive the whole let him manifest himself forbearing one another and forgiving one another Father forgive them they know not what they do having that spirit and if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do you Paul is just giving a long explanation as put on Christ the nature and the character of Christ is gone and above all things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness for we know charity is gone we know the whole motive God is love is perfect love me and Rachel's we're coming in the church and she comes with me usually to drive me home want him to drive me home at night my vision is not as good and I'm usually tired after ministering so I just feel safer although sometimes the way she drives I get prayed up to so I got to say no I'm just kidding about them but we're talking about that the motive what is the motive behind the action and we are talking a little about and the things are happening today and how the fear has swept into the people so much fear so much nervousness so much what's going on what's going on what's going to happen you know what do you think about it ask your opinion and all and I said well fear is what Satan works with that's what he's always worked with through fear but god's motive god is love and his motive is love and everything that god is does is motivated by love for you and because it is love when he chastises you when he corrects you when he gets your attention it is for your good not for your condemnation not to put you down not to make you feel worthless see you're not a child of God then you begin to brother brother green used to say it this way condemnation it's what Satan uses to to talk to you with see if you were really a child of God you would have done that you wouldn't had a thought you wouldn't acted like that you know and he begins but conviction is what God were see says now daughter no son you know you know that's not how a Christian asks so let's do something about it and he comes and he touches your heart he talks to your heart you say Lord you're right I'm sorry I'll make that right I'll take care of that I don't want to offend you neither do I want to offend any of your children I don't want to offend anybody because I don't know remember brother branham is ministering in his preaching and he says he said don't call them Rickey's and Raquette us because some of them are my children I don't know who they are and my God had mercy in me I would ask God to have mercy on them again he says put on charity which is the bond of perfect completeness wholeness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts your Lord you know the song is a song of worship it's a song of gratitude it's a song of praise back to him your heart is just the song is thing is to worship him to praise him to lift him up it's not a song and in in some of the songs that are being in composed today and they call him Christian songs and sometimes you listen and there is no worship to God in them it's self gratification it's just self praise it's a lifting up of self but he says in singing and spiritual songs Psalm singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord understanding Lord this is my love and my worship back to you and whatsoever you doing were in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him everything is based under that motive and that way we do and you know I know everybody in here and those listening you never get upset you never get angry and ever you never think a bad thought because you guys are all way ahead of me I know that but some of us know we're not there yet so sometimes we have to say Lord I'm sorry and sometimes I have to go to my brother and my sister my wife one of my children my coworker so my hey I'm sorry I shouldn't act it that way I shouldn't have done that and he says again that's it and whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father if in my asking for forgiveness in my humble in myself that fits right in there because that's how father that's how Jesus was that same spirit saying Lord lay it not against their charge don't hold him guilty for it Lord forgive them give him a chance give him an opportunity brother branham the Lord said they're going to lay a trick for you there Satan is going to come in and he's going to try to and and he talks about that that young couple he said that they were being ungodly in the church and he said anything you say will be and he looks at him but the Spirit of Christ in the man says I forgive you I'm glad that Spirit of Christ says I forgive you because how many times have we needed forgiveness have we needed the Lord to say son daughter I forgive you and he says do everything in the name of logic all that I say or do let it be pleasing Lord to you now he says you know we look at this and we say well brother Aaron you know if I'm elect I'm chosen of God I'm his you know then you know it's I've got it made I can be what I want to be I can do as I want I'd question that a child of God is not that way a child of God is looking and saying Lord let my life be pleasing to you let me a being a true ambassador of the kingdom of God just like a husband and wife or just like parents to children just like a brother and his sister just like a mother and a father to their own children if we're truly a true father a true mother with her we're not looking to hurt to damage to take a rule over them we're trying to encourage or trying to raise them I was talking a little bit with Rachel as in the sometimes you might have thought the dad and mom were angry with you upset with you and we might have been at times I'm gonna saying we were we weren't at times but it was it was we are our motive was to help to raise you to be a young lady a Christian lady grow up and they say that was our motive we mean always done it right but that was our motive now in today's world sometimes it's not the motive of people I was listening to a testimony of a young lady or she was giving her testimony as she was trying to to speak to other women who had and she talked about her raising and and and how she was she was trafficked out to two men and everything and and all that she was raised in and such an ungodly thing and it is out in the world it does happen I'm not saying it doesn't but when you have Christian parents and when you have God in you you're at you're your hope your desire all you want to do is to raise to encourage to lift somewhat of the Lord just like you were merciful merciful to me be merciful to that one also remember Jesus when he's talking about that that man that was laying there on the side of the road and he was wounded and hurt and he said and the priest gave it a wide turn and the leave I gave him oh I turned and everybody the Christians all went around him but the Samaritan came by and took and he dressed them any any any any help can clean up his wounds and he took him to the end close by and says take care of this man and and here here's some money to cover it and when I come back because I will be coming back through here if there's any more I'll pick up that charge - that's the life of a Christian because of the grace of God in their life they realize that that's how God treated them and again Paul is talking about this and in Romans chapter 11 and I don't know how far along we'll get on this but let's look at Romans chapter 11 starting with verse 1 and Rome and and Paul here is speaking about his children his people Israel and he said I say then hath God cast away his people god forbid for I also AM an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew what not that ye the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying let's go on Lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God and to him I have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knees the knee to the image of bale he said Lord these people they've turned against you they've they've even killed your prophets but God specifically tells him I have seven thousand who have not bowed their knees he didn't say oh there's a bunch of people if there's a handful of people he said I have seven thousand he is specific God knows every one of them let's go on even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace and if by grace then it is no more works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work so again when you go to your job and you work you put the hours in you do what you're called to do you do what you signed to do and to hand you a paycheck you're thankful for it but you're did you did you did what you were supposed to but if the boss comes by and he says Peter you've done a great job you really I'm happy with you and everything you've done that here's a check for $5,000 on top of what you going now that's grace that's that's unmerited in a sense you're doing what they've told you to do you met your obligations and you know they they promised you a certain salary or Harvard whatever that is but then they give you something like that a bonus if we would call it that way that's grace but you would come and say Lord I've worked I've worked I've worked and I did all of this I deserve all of this no you made it into works then it is the grace of God and this is what Paul is talking about here that's gone what then Israel have not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election has obtained it and the rest were blinded it's God's working all this according as it is written God has given the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear and to this day God blinded his own children Israel the seed of Abraham the literal seed of Abraham so that you and I would have an opportunity but was it just something he says well I got no it was all part of God's plan it's all part of God's plan let's go on and David says let their table be made a snare in a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their their back alway now let's go on and I say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid but rather through their fall salvation has come unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy God chose to do it this way God called it this way God said this is how I'm going to lay this plan out now I'm even going to take a man named Saul whom the Christians of that time would have said no he would have not got voted on they would have said no we will not elect it but God said I'm gonna do this that's gone now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the Minish them be the richest of the Gentiles how much more their fullness for I speak to you Gentiles here as much as I am apostasy of the Gentiles I magnify in my office he say no I mean showing you where I stand what I'm called to do let's go through that was gone if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them for the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead God chose to do that and Paul recognizes this and he says God cast him away for the salvation of the Gentiles and you and I were included in that because God had it in the back of his mind let's continue on here for if the first-fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree were grafted in amongst them and with empar takes of the root and the fatness of the olive tree we receive over the same God and but they didn't know him as Jesus because to them is still to be revealed but it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's still God both not against the branches but if thou boast thou Bharath not the root but the root D thou will say then the the branches are broken off that I might be graft in Paul is telling us how we came in how God chose to do it here I'm going through this as quick as again well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high-minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and the severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou shall be cut off Paul says don't glorify don't magnify yourself don't lift yourself up stay in that humbleness that sweetness and that grace of God because it's through His goodness and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for God is able to graft them in again forth outward cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and we're graft contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which shall which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree now we are coming to that place to see that place when all of that is coming to his fulfillment now let's finish up here for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery unless he should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in the part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in and I'm glad that God did it this way because if it had been my choice being a human I would have said Lord they've turned their back on you having nothing to do with him but God allowed them to turn their back on him so that you and I would have this opportunity had God chosen to take the children the the first generation home the first church age you and I would have never had the opportunity and if the Ephesian Church come to a full perfection gone into rapture you and I would have never been here but God has a reason and a way to do the things he did he does that's gone and so shall all Israel be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away the ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins there comes to the that day when they say where did you receive those scars and he says in the house of my friends he still called him friends and concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes for the gifts and callings of God or without repentance you didn't earn him you didn't deserve him God gave them to you for as Ian tine pass have not believed God you have now obtained mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believe that through your mercy they cell ups also obtain mercy it gets reversed right back I'm glad that God is merciful to me and how am I going to express that by being merciful to others by saying God as you had mercy in me as you love me as you washed me as you do it unto them also give unto them also for God hath concluded all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past fine get out for who have known the might of the Lord or who has been his counselor Paul says look at this you and I would have never done it this way you and I wouldn't have never planned it this way but God did so and he didn't ask your opinion of it either do you think I should do he chose to do it this way and I love him for his choosing in his election and the way he does things because he knows what's best for us or who have first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen you say amen to that amen to God be all the glory to God be all the praise to God be may he be exalted in all of this not ourselves and this is where I was saying let's be careful that we worship Him and love him and praise him and don't walk around saying I'm it and you're not because you don't know where they are in fact let your life what does the scripture tell us you're a light to this world you're the salt of the earth that they might want what you have they might desire and if there is that representation of God they would see it in you and say that is remember that little eagle brother Branham talks and that was was taken by the farmer and put in the nest of the with the chickens there but he was an eagle he didn't know that he was born under and under that mother hen he thought he was part of that chicken group but there was a mother Eagle saying hey I'm missing one of mine and she begins to search for him she begins to go out and look for him and and he's going you know I'm I was born here I was raised here this is what we do but I just don't fit with them I'm not like them I look different than them I act different than him sometimes they do this and I don't want to do that sometimes I do it and I go and ask God for forgiveness cuz that's not my desire but he didn't know who he was yet but then she comes flying by and she says there's that one that's missing and he hears that Eagle cry he hears that screaming hisses hey there's something about in that responding back to that that is something and he's looking at me said but hey I've never seen any of these chickens fly never seen them go up into the heavens how do I do that and mother begins to tell him God begins to speak back to you and say here some of this some of that get into this book and begin to read begin to listen begin to hear get on your knees and ask God to unveil this thing and he will show you he'll say set your wings he go and fly and what was it he was always an eagle but he there was a time for that to come but you know brother Branham never has turns around and says when he flew away he looked at chickens and said I hate you I think nothing of you he said I'm an eagle I belong over here by the grace of God and you know my heart's desire is Lord that they would have that same opportunity that I have that you've given to me to know you and your fullness to know you and your love to experience you to have a change in their lives as I've had because it's Christ in us and he said oh that he said o Israel o Israel how oft as a mother would hen would spread your wings how often I want to do that that same desire when you see your neighbor going the opposite way you say God have mercy on them the same way you've had whereas if the musicians would come for it I trusted that the thought came across the way it was in my heart that it is a work of God it is a choice of God it's a call it's a representation in your life but be grateful for it be loving for it I have the Spirit of Christ in you because it is the Spirit of Christ the life of Christ and let that express the love and the mercy back to others around you to your brother to your sister to your mother to your father to your child to your neighbor to whoever it might be let Christ let the light of God reach out to wherever there is I am redeemed I am redeemed bought with a price redeem means you were there at one time and maybe you got traded maybe you got sold off maybe you fell into something but the Redeemer came I've come back to seek just to to save that which was lost and I am reading Oh [Music] ah [Music] have changed my [Music] ha [Music] ah [Music] lorded cost you everything to redeem to bring back out of the pawn shop out of the clutch of Satan's hands you went down Lord as you you said I lay my life down when you you were there Gethsemane and the decision had to be made the choice had to be made or to redeem that which was lost to redeem which which back in the beginning when when Adam willingly stepped out with Eve Lord knowing that they would lose that that inheritance or the rights there to eat and Lord but in this there was a plan in this there was a something that you had seen and you Fortin you and you were going to do Lord but it costs you everything Lord it cost you your life and cost you your reputation it costs you the splendor of heaven your throne there had cost you everything you didn't even have a place to lay your head a house to sleep in Lord you didn't have a place to really call your own home you didn't have your own church to stand there and preach on every Sunday with a congregation you you went from place to place it cost you everything you are called Beelzebub your own your own Lord received you not they turn your back on you Lord but it was all part of your plan Lord but as a man Lord being robed in flesh you felt the heard of it you felt the anguish you felt the rejection Lord so she would understand that you would know but that day came and Gethsemane and they said you said father can we redeem them a different way can we get back to eat in a different way but then you said no father whatever your will is because it would take like in the very beginning the blood of an innocent one Lord to pay the price and you willingly win and on that day Lord when you gave up the girls and in it you travel down into the depth of hell and you went down there and you preached to those souls in prison Lord and you went there too to those Lord that had died before Lord those Saints and you opened the door and you called them out Lord and you began to tell you begin to show all the reason and the plan that you had and what you intended to do Lord and on the third day you rose again and you gravid your disciples together and you told them go up go up into that upper room and wait because this spirit that's in me will be in you and therefore you can go out and preach and teach and show what this is what God has done what God is doing Lord we thank you for it Lord we thank you that you were willing to do that Lord may our hearts and our attitude in our life or our whole being just show the appreciation and the love or what you've done for us or that you're redeemed us and you care for us thank you in Jesus Christ hi Oh [Music] [Music] more than ever [Music] [Music] or there Oh [Music] ha for that [Music] [Music] more than boy [Music] for the I want [Music] we've been made more than conquerors we've been made more than overcome [Music] Oh Oh [Music] more than all the [Music] we [Applause] [Music] [Applause] big [Music] I [Music] big [Music] big heart [Music] me [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] I [Music] maybe life is worth it it's it's sometimes things get hard and sometimes secrets and contrary to what we thought they should but because he lives and because he's he overcome then God bless each one of you tonight trusting that this it was said and delivered would be the Lord would unveil it to you just what my heart was what my intention was it's not by chance it's not by accident by managers it's what God has chosen to do and I want to walk in his choosing I want to walk in his favor because when you go against it it's a hard life then you're like the prodigal son when you finally find yourself down there at the bottom eating with the pigs saying how did I get here but it was still a son and fear in that place today just say I want to go back to the house of my father because in my father's house there's food to eat there's a place to sleep there's rest and if that desire is to go back to the house of the father's because the father is drawing you Lord there might be one right now may be sitting there wherever they're at their hope may be outside of it alone maybe in a you know in a hard place right now they'd be locked up in a prison cell in a hospital so bad mental ward even let them come to themselves or maybe they aren't coming to themselves and may they turn their heart back to your father say father will you accept me Lord in you and no wise would ever turn one of your own you said my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow Lord sometimes we get a confused maybe we get we get off the path Lord but we are your shoes there might be what needed that today and they turned our heart back to Jesus Christ Jesus has the table spread where the saints of God Jesus has we're the Saints of gonna face [Music] [Music] to sweeten up with [Music] Specter [Music] [Music] Oh the disciples [Music] the master [Music] they found [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] almost Oh [Music] Jesus neighbor [Music] the master call [Music] all the time [Music] turn the water [Music] [Music]
