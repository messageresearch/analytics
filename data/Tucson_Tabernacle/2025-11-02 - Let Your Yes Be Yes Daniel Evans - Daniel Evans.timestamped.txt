[4:19] knee will bow and every single tongue
[4:21] will confess that Jesus is Lord. And
[4:24] we've said it before, but we don't have

[10:20] Before we sing it, let's sing that old
[10:22] hymn of the church. Amazing grace, how
[10:24] sweet the sound [music] that saved a
[10:26] wretch like me. Key of F.
[10:31] Amazing

[10:36] how sweet
[10:38] the sound
[10:41] that save
[10:44] a rich

[10:51] Oh, I once
[10:54] was lost, [singing and music]
[10:57] but now
[11:00] I'm found.
[11:03] I [music] was blind,
[11:05] but [singing]
[11:06] now
[11:08] I see. It was grace [music] that taught.
[11:12] Let me hear you. Was grace
[11:16] that taught
[11:19] [music] my heart
[11:22] to fear
[11:25] and grace
[11:27] my fears [singing]
[11:30] breathe.
[11:34] [music]
[11:35] How precious
[11:39] did
[11:41] that [music] grace [singing]
[11:44] appear.
[11:46] The [music]
[11:47] hour
[11:49] I first
[11:51] believe
[11:54] through many dangers.
[11:57] through many
[12:00] dangerous
[12:03] toys to [singing]
[12:06] snares.
[12:08] I [music] have
[12:11] already
[12:14] come [singing]
[12:18] to [music]
[12:19] grace
[12:21] that brought [singing]
[12:24] me safe.
[12:26] thus [singing] far. Oh, and grace
[12:32] will he
[12:34] be home when we've been there.
[12:39] And when we've [singing]
[12:42] been there

[12:49] years,
[12:50] bright shineing
[12:54] as [music]
[12:56] the sun. [singing]
[13:01] We've no [singing]
[13:03] less days [music]
[13:06] to sing
[13:09] God's praise [music]
[13:12] than when
[13:14] we first
[13:17] began.
[13:18] Let's raise our hands and sing. Praise
[13:20] [music] God. Oh, praise God.

[14:04] I'm really lying.
[14:06] If you have a need, as you know, you can
[14:09] raise your hand and the Lord will see
[14:10] your need. Even if you don't raise your
[14:12] hand, he already knows it. But you raise
[14:14] your hand in faith that you know he's
[14:16] going to he's going to answer. He's
[14:18] going to be there for you. And then if
[14:20] you don't have a need, you can raise
[14:22] your hands and worship to him this
[14:24] morning. He is worthy of all praise.
[14:26] [music]
[14:29] Good morning and God bless you all.
[14:32] You know this morning we were reading in
[14:34] our devotion about uh [music] when the
[14:36] ark was brought into the temple that
[14:38] Solomon had just built and when the
[14:40] people were in unity with one voice
[14:43] [music]
[14:44] and the musicians were in unity.
[14:47] Everything was in unity in one accord.
[14:49] And then the spirit of God came down in
[14:53] such power and such presence that
[14:56] everything had to stop. They just had to
[14:59] stop in awe and worship of God. And I
[15:03] pray this morning that as we're joined
[15:06] together here, that our hearts are
[15:08] joined together, our minds are joined
[15:10] together, our thoughts are joined
[15:12] together, our spirits are joined
[15:13] together, our hearts are joined together
[15:15] as [music] one in Jesus Christ. that we
[15:18] can approach the Lord together and
[15:20] [music] just invite his continued
[15:22] presence because his presence is surely
[15:24] surely here. We have one written request
[15:26] this morning from brother John and
[15:29] sister Anne Lucer.
[15:31] Please remember an as she travels to
[15:34] Pennsylvania tomorrow to be with family
[15:36] as her father's health is failing. Thank
[15:39] you for your prayers. And sister, we
[15:41] pray that God go with you and minister
[15:43] [music] to your father and to your
[15:45] family that's there. So, let's just join
[15:48] our hearts together in prayer. Lord
[15:50] Jesus, Lord, it's such a privilege. It's
[15:53] such an honor, Lord, to be gathered here
[15:56] in 2025,
[15:59] Lord, to look back at Calvary, see the
[16:01] price that you paid, Lord, that you made
[16:03] the way for each one of us by your
[16:05] grace, Lord. that in spite of our the
[16:08] many dangers, toils, and snares that
[16:10] we've come through, you've seen us
[16:11] through them all. Lord, we just pray
[16:14] that you continue to be with us. Help
[16:15] us, Lord, to bring as many as we can
[16:18] with us, Lord, as we someday will be

[27:40] [music]
[27:42] he breathed again
[27:46] and rose [singing] to [music] stand
[27:51] in my [singing] defense.
[27:59] So [singing and music] I come
[28:02] to tell you he's alive. [singing]
[28:06] to tell you that he [music] dries
[28:11] every tear that falls. [music]
[28:15] Oh, so I come
[28:19] to tell you that he saves [singing]
[28:23] to shout and to proclaim
[28:27] that he's coming. Stand and let's sing
[28:29] that again. And so I come, oh, so I
[28:33] [singing] come [music]
[28:35] to tell you he's alive. [singing]
[28:38] [music]
[28:39] To tell you that he drives
[28:44] every tear that falls.
[28:47] [music]
[28:48] Oh, so I [singing] come
[28:52] to shout you that he [music] sings.
[28:55] [singing]
[28:56] to shout and to proclaim [music]
[29:00] that he's coming [singing] back for you.
[29:03] [music]
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[29:07] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[29:14] Amen.
[29:18] God bless you friends. Let's bow our
[29:20] heads.
[29:24] Lord God Almighty, we thank you,
[29:28] Lord. Thank you for your spirit.
[29:32] Thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you
[29:34] for your love.
[29:36] Thank you for the blood that was shed on
[29:38] the cross,
[29:40] for our sins, Lord, that we might spend
[29:42] an eternity with our savior.
[29:45] Lord, we pray that your spirit would be
[29:48] present with us this morning. And Lord,
[29:51] as I open up these scriptures and as I
[29:53] read the word, may the same spirit
[29:57] that was there when it was originally
[29:58] spoken be with us this morning, we pray.
[30:02] Father, may each person that's here, if
[30:06] they would have something on their
[30:07] heart, something that they would need, I
[30:08] pray that they would receive it this
[30:10] morning.
[30:12] That all of us would leave this building
[30:16] better people. Father, in Jesus name we
[30:19] pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated.
[30:26] First welcome
[30:29] to our visitors. I have uh brother
[30:32] Brian, Sister John
[30:34] Vanden Langenberg. Where are you?
[30:37] Welcome, brother, sister. Welcome. It's
[30:39] good to have you in service. is I think
[30:40] that you know a lot of people here
[30:42] probablyize [applause]
[30:47] for all the construction out out here
[30:50] and and ripping up all the concrete. You
[30:52] know, sometimes
[30:55] you have to rip things out. You have to
[30:57] tear something down to rebuild it in the
[31:00] right way. And it's the same with us.
[31:03] The Lord sometimes has to tear us down
[31:07] &gt;&gt; so he can rebuild us in the right way.
[31:10] We could we could take the sanctuary and
[31:12] we could just slap a coat of paint on
[31:14] the walls, but it's the same wall. It's
[31:17] just got some paint over it. It's the
[31:20] same wiring behind the wall. The
[31:22] problems are still there.
[31:25] But when you tear something down, when
[31:27] you really get rid of the old and
[31:30] replace it with, the Bible says the new
[31:32] man,
[31:34] &gt;&gt; then you have a change. Not just
[31:38] changing the outside, but Jesus goes in
[31:42] and he changes the inside of a person.
[31:44] That's what we've been talking about on
[31:46] this sermon on the mount. We'll continue
[31:47] that in a little bit, a little bit later
[31:50] on, but that's what the whole thing
[31:53] about Jesus Christ is. Before
[31:56] Christ, it was the outside.
[31:59] Jesus didn't do away with the law,
[32:03] but he fulfilled the law and he started
[32:06] to work on the inside of a person so
[32:09] that word could come out from the inside
[32:11] and manifest itself on the outside of
[32:13] us. I want to give a report, a short
[32:16] report on the trip that uh Daniel and
[32:19] Lily and I went to Louisville to do an
[32:23] outreach. I asked the church to pray and
[32:24] and we went I sent a video when we were
[32:26] there. We um it wasn't what we expected
[32:31] and uh if if you want to put the picture
[32:34] up of the place that we had. This is our
[32:37] um the location. We expected about 50 or
[32:40] 60 people. We got about what we expected
[32:42] and uh we had our service there in that
[32:46] room. We um my brother bought dinner for
[32:50] everybody and it uh as I said it turned
[32:53] out different. Thank you. It turned out
[32:55] different than what we expected. What we
[32:58] wanted was
[33:01] my brother talked to all of the it was a
[33:05] gym if you don't know if you're not
[33:06] familiar with it. So we started this
[33:09] boxing gym about six or seven years ago
[33:12] and we wanted to make it an outreach to
[33:14] the local community and it's done very
[33:16] well. We have a Bible study every week.
[33:19] Many of the uh fighters that have come
[33:21] in have made changes in their lives and
[33:23] and their families. So, what we wanted
[33:25] to do is take the next step. And the
[33:28] next step was to have a service and to
[33:31] open up the altar for those that may
[33:34] need something to come in to come down
[33:37] to the altar and give their hearts to
[33:38] the Lord. So, what we were planning on
[33:41] Adam got everything together. He got
[33:42] everything rented and he and he uh had
[33:45] it catered. He spent a lot of money
[33:46] putting all this together and a lot of
[33:48] prayer and a lot of work that he put
[33:50] into it. He asked me if I would
[33:52] minister. So, we brought uh Lily and
[33:55] Daniel out to do the music and my nephew
[33:59] Adam's son also helped with the music
[34:01] and we had it all ready. And what we
[34:03] were going to do is we were going to
[34:05] have good worship and then I was going
[34:08] to speak and I was going to open up the
[34:10] altar and all of these people that had
[34:13] not given their hearts to the Lord, they
[34:14] were going to come to the altar. They
[34:16] were going to give their hearts to the
[34:17] Lord. They were going to be crying and
[34:19] there was going to be big changes in all
[34:21] these people's lives. And we had it
[34:23] figured out and and we had it ready.
[34:26] everything we had. We told the Lord what
[34:28] we wanted and
[34:31] he reminded us that he's in charge
[34:34] and not us.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; That's what I wanted. That's what my
[34:39] brother wanted. And that's not the way
[34:41] it turned out. We went there
[34:44] and we got about the same amount of
[34:47] people as we were expecting, but they
[34:48] weren't the people we were expecting. It
[34:50] wasn't the sinners, the gang members,
[34:54] the inner city ones that showed up. They
[34:57] didn't show up.
[34:59] Very only two of them really came.
[35:03] But who did show up
[35:06] were
[35:08] a few of the leaders in the community.
[35:11] Two young pastors
[35:13] at a church who were just starting a
[35:15] church right down the road. They came.
[35:18] We didn't know. Um, a pastor that I knew
[35:24] of a fairly large church in
[35:25] Jeffersonville, he came, which I wasn't
[35:28] expecting him to come, and um
[35:33] there were uh a number of more of the
[35:36] leaders in the community that came. one
[35:40] uh brother came that he's he's kind of a
[35:42] pastor, but he has this big building and
[35:46] they actually bring in some of the the
[35:49] poor people and give them a place to
[35:51] stay for the night if they need a place
[35:53] to stay and give them food packages in
[35:55] that big beautiful beautiful building
[35:58] that they have. So they they showed up
[36:03] and the coach for the mixed martial art
[36:08] uh part of the gym, he showed up with
[36:10] with his fighters and they're already
[36:13] Christians. They're good men. The the
[36:16] leader is he lost his son last year. His
[36:21] 19 I believe he's 19 drowned
[36:24] and it just really really hit him hard.
[36:27] tore him apart and he doubled down and
[36:32] he said that that was one of the pivotal
[36:35] times in his life and he was just kind
[36:38] of riding the fence. He could have just
[36:39] went off into the world and done his
[36:41] thing or he could have just jumped in
[36:43] with both feet to serve Jesus Christ. He
[36:46] jumped in with both feet
[36:48] &gt;&gt; and tremendous testimony from him. We
[36:50] had him open up the service and I
[36:54] ministered on on some things and uh
[36:57] which I'll share in a moment. And uh
[37:01] some other ones that showed up is uh
[37:03] David Andes, you know, Daniel Andy's
[37:05] ministered here for a while. His
[37:07] brother, a friend of mine, we worked
[37:09] together when I was in Jeffersonville.
[37:11] He showed up and one of the pastors, one
[37:15] of the young pastors that had recently
[37:17] been, he'd really been in the saddle for
[37:19] like two weeks. He had just been elected
[37:21] pastor of his church. They don't have a
[37:23] church building. They're renting. And he
[37:25] showed up and and he had a jacket that
[37:28] said Andes Roofing on it. That is David
[37:32] Andes and and Daniel Andes's brother has
[37:35] this company. Well, he ended up he was
[37:37] he worked for that company and he had no
[37:40] idea
[37:41] what we were somebody just had invited
[37:44] him and it was the community. So he came
[37:46] he had no idea that we were close with
[37:48] Andy's family. So here he is and he
[37:50] meets David and David's like, "Hey,
[37:52] that's my name and that's my brother."
[37:53] And he says, "Oh." And then they they
[37:55] start talking. So it was it was really
[37:56] we could see that the Lord was with us.
[38:00] So, we didn't have this outpouring
[38:05] of the Holy Spirit that we wanted. But
[38:07] we have to be careful in not trying to
[38:08] put God in our own box and try to make
[38:12] him meet our expectations. Because I
[38:15] tell you, if we do that, it won't be as
[38:17] good. It won't be as farreaching
[38:22] if we get our needs met. And then it
[38:25] really becomes about self.
[38:29] I wanted just me, my flesh. I wanted to
[38:33] see these these young people coming
[38:36] together and coming to the altar. I
[38:38] wanted to see that. I wanted to see them
[38:41] from my sermon come up there and just be
[38:45] touched and fall down at the altar and
[38:48] just start praying and start worshiping.
[38:50] I'm going to talk. Take a time out here.
[38:54] Gotta lace up the cleats or I'll fall
[38:56] over.
[38:58] Um, that's what I wanted,
[39:01] but it isn't what God wanted. There was,
[39:04] by the grace of God, one young man came
[39:07] to the altar and gave his heart to the
[39:08] Lord. And that was, that was beautiful.
[39:12] But what we had, we had these two young
[39:16] pastors who had recently been elected.
[39:18] They have a church of about 100 people.
[39:20] They have no building.
[39:22] This other
[39:25] man is a leader in the community. He's
[39:28] got this big building that he does all
[39:30] of this uh humanitarian work from and
[39:34] nobody to occupy it
[39:38] and they never met each other and they
[39:39] were literally two blocks from each
[39:41] other.
[39:42] So they get to get well I talked to both
[39:45] of them and I said hey I want to
[39:48] introduce you to him. Pastor with no
[39:51] building and congregation meet brother
[39:55] with building
[39:57] or a pastor with congregation and no
[40:00] building meet brother with building and
[40:02] no congregation. And then they got
[40:04] together and this other man that I knew
[40:06] this other pastor is a fairly large
[40:08] church over across the river in
[40:10] Jeffersonville. He had the resources and
[40:13] he has the resources to help these
[40:14] people and to mentor these people. And
[40:17] afterwards I just felt for some reason
[40:21] I look and it and I I think we had
[40:23] beautiful music. The the um Lily and
[40:26] Daniel and Benjamin did a great job. And
[40:30] I ministered and my sermon
[40:35] didn't really didn't really do anything.
[40:36] And I'm I'm thinking, well Lord, what is
[40:39] going on? Why do I feel good when I went
[40:42] home?
[40:43] And I felt good because God used this to
[40:48] build a foundation for something that's
[40:51] coming. And so when I was talking with
[40:53] Adam, Adam was like, "Man, I'm sorry
[40:54] that all these fighters didn't show up.
[40:56] I don't know why." I said, "Adam, if
[40:58] they would have shown up and they would
[40:59] have done what we wanted and they would
[41:01] have fell down at the altar and they
[41:02] would have given their hearts to the
[41:03] Lord Jesus, where would you have sent
[41:05] them?"
[41:08] They didn't have a place to go
[41:10] in that community where they lived.
[41:12] They're not going to drive an hour away
[41:15] or 45 minutes away. They needed a place
[41:17] right there. And what happened was we
[41:19] built that foundation. And now the Lord,
[41:22] I believe the Lord is going to use what
[41:24] happened. And it's going to be a much
[41:26] greater work than what we wanted to do,
[41:28] what we were expecting. God was in it.
[41:31] Can you imagine when the Apostle Paul
[41:33] when he went to the church at Ephesus?
[41:36] He went there, there weren't 60. Like in
[41:40] Louisville, there were 12.
[41:44] Can you imagine when he got there how he
[41:46] felt? It's like, wow, just 12 people.
[41:52] And he stayed there for three years and
[41:55] ministered to these people, building and
[41:56] building and building. And then he turns
[42:00] the church over to a young man. We all
[42:03] know his name. His name is Timothy.
[42:06] The church continues to grow. But way
[42:08] back when it was 12 people, Paul saw
[42:11] that there is potential there. He didn't
[42:13] just say, "Oh, there's not enough
[42:14] people. I'm going to go to the next
[42:15] place." He didn't say, "Oh, well, nobody
[42:18] fell down at the altar." You know, none
[42:19] of this. All he said was, "Have you
[42:21] received the Holy Spirit since you've
[42:22] believed?" They're like, "Whoa,
[42:26] we don't know that there is a Holy
[42:27] Spirit." and he tells him how to be
[42:29] baptized. And then it started to grow
[42:31] and grow. And then here comes Timothy.
[42:33] And Timothy takes over and continues it
[42:35] to grow. And then another man came there
[42:38] in the in the last years of his life.
[42:41] One of the greatest people that we have
[42:43] ever seen in this Bible. His name is
[42:45] John,
[42:47] the beloved disciple of Jesus.
[42:51] He ministers at Ephesus. And he
[42:54] continues to grow to where Ephesus was,
[42:56] if it wasn't the biggest, it was one of
[42:57] the most important and biggest hubs of
[43:00] Christianity in that whole area was
[43:03] Ephesus.
[43:05] Started with just a little group. And I
[43:09] look at what happened with our trip. It
[43:13] was not what I wanted,
[43:17] but thank God it wasn't what I wanted.
[43:20] They would have came to the altar.
[43:23] They would have done what we want, what
[43:25] we, our measure of a success is.
[43:29] And then they would have just gone right
[43:30] back and it would have worn off and they
[43:33] would have been the same people that
[43:35] they were before. But now we have these
[43:39] men who are invested in that
[43:41] neighborhood, in that area that have a
[43:45] burden. All of them are doing outre
[43:47] outreach work and helping out. They're
[43:49] doing everything that they can. They
[43:52] have a burden. I jump in. I'm going to
[43:54] leave. Adam has a burden. And Adam is
[43:57] working now with those men and they're
[43:59] putting they're helping get this thing
[44:01] together. Now, those pastors are going
[44:04] to start teaching the Bible study.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's going to it's just Thank
[44:09] God. Thank God
[44:11] &gt;&gt; that he didn't do what I wanted him to
[44:14] do.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [applause]
[44:22] I spoke on
[44:24] and we
[44:26] ministry is
[44:29] is such an important thing and if you
[44:31] really have a burden from for the people
[44:35] it's not your ministry that matters.
[44:38] My friend Steven Bryant sent me this
[44:41] quote this morning from Charles
[44:43] Spurgeon.
[44:45] He said, 'If sinners be damned, at least
[44:48] let them leap to hell over our dead
[44:50] bodies.
[44:52] And if they perish, let them perish with
[44:54] our arms wrapped around about their
[44:56] knees, imploring them to stay. If hell
[44:59] must be filled, let it be filled in the
[45:03] teeth of our exertions, and let not one
[45:06] go unwarned and unpaid for.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; That's how it should be.
[45:12] You're going to go to hell over my dead
[45:13] body is how we should be saying it with
[45:16] everyone that's around us. With our
[45:17] children, with our friends, I stand for
[45:20] Christ. And brother or sister, if you're
[45:23] going to go to hell, if you're going to
[45:24] choose to go to hell, I'm going to do
[45:25] everything I can to keep you from that
[45:27] place. And that was what Jesus Christ
[45:29] did. He came here. He gave his life. He
[45:31] went to the cross so we wouldn't go to
[45:33] hell. He was spit on. A crown of thorns
[45:37] was pressed into his scalp.
[45:39] He was laughed at. He was stripped naked
[45:41] and hung up on a cross dying for all of
[45:45] us so that we would not go to hell.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; And if we have his same spirit,
[45:53] we should have the same motives as Jesus
[45:55] had.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; I told a story. I was the night before
[46:03] um the outreach meetings. I woke up at
[46:06] uh like 4:30 in the morning and there
[46:09] was a time difference. So, it was like
[46:10] 1:30 here. And
[46:14] for some reason, I feel like the Lord
[46:17] laid an experience that I had a a couple
[46:20] weeks ago on my heart. Very common
[46:23] experience that all of us have have been
[46:25] in. I was driving and I came to a red
[46:30] light. There was a truck, a pickup truck
[46:34] in front of me and I I was behind the
[46:36] pickup truck and the it was a nice
[46:39] pickup. It was a a man about my age. He
[46:42] had a beard about like mine. He uh the
[46:46] you could tell he was well off. You
[46:48] could tell he was conservative. And I
[46:51] was just I when I pulled up, you know,
[46:52] you can sometimes see him in the in the
[46:54] the mirror, the side mirror. I could see
[46:56] his face in there. and I pull up behind
[47:00] him and the light turns green and he
[47:04] doesn't go. He's distracted with
[47:07] something. So,
[47:10] I'm like, "Okay, how do I handle this?"
[47:13] I obvious can tell right now I like this
[47:15] guy. Um, what do I do? Do I give him a
[47:21] little do I just not do anything or do I
[47:24] give him a little tap or do I do like so
[47:27] many people do and lay on the horn go
[47:30] stupid, you know? And so I have this
[47:34] quandry. Not that I would ever do that,
[47:36] the latter. Um,
[47:39] but I'm I'm I'm sitting there, the
[47:43] lights green and I just give him a
[47:47] little tap
[47:48] and he looks up. Oh, sorry. And he he
[47:51] goes, "The Lord brought this back to my
[47:54] mind in the middle of the night and I
[47:57] actually woke up and I was preaching on
[47:59] it
[48:01] and
[48:03] this man that was in front of me,
[48:07] I feel like he represents so many
[48:10] so-called Christians today
[48:13] where the light is green and they're
[48:16] sitting at a green light and they're not
[48:18] going. They're just sitting there
[48:22] and they're causing the people behind
[48:24] them to get backed up
[48:27] and sometimes it takes a little tap.
[48:30] Sometimes it takes something a little
[48:32] bit more. But the point of it is move.
[48:37] The lights green. Go.
[48:40] And with these folks in in the the
[48:43] Louisville outreach, I told them, I
[48:46] said, "The lights green. You leaders in
[48:49] the church, hit the gas, start doing
[48:52] something. Don't just sit there and look
[48:55] around and daydream.
[48:58] Go.
[48:59] And that's the way a Christian should
[49:01] be. We should always have that thought.
[49:02] I'm not just going to sit at the at the
[49:04] green light. I'm going to go. I'm going
[49:06] to do something. Jesus, when he came,
[49:10] the first the first record we have of
[49:12] him besides when he was about 12 years
[49:14] old, he came he came to John the
[49:16] Baptist. He gets baptized.
[49:20] He's John says,
[49:23] "I should you should be baptizing me."
[49:25] And Jesus is like, "Well, yeah, that's
[49:27] true, but it becomes us
[49:32] to fulfill all righteousness." He's
[49:34] like, "John, you and me.
[49:37] We need to fulfill this." John baptizes
[49:40] him. He comes out. He goes into the
[49:43] wilderness. He's tempted in the
[49:45] wilderness for 40 days. All the
[49:47] temptations that you and I feel, Jesus
[49:50] felt those. He was a high priest that
[49:53] can be touched by the feeling of our
[49:54] infirmities. He knows how it is to have
[49:57] a desire that you shouldn't have. Jesus
[50:00] knows how it is. He overcame it. Then he
[50:04] comes out of the wilderness
[50:06] and he starts preaching, "Repent for the
[50:09] kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[50:12] And then he gets his disciples and he
[50:15] brings them to this place on the shore
[50:18] of the Sea of Galilee, a hill there.
[50:22] And he starts to preach his first
[50:27] recorded sermon.
[50:29] And I believe it is the greatest sermon
[50:32] that has ever been preached in the
[50:34] history of mankind. And that is this
[50:36] sermon on the mount. He starts out with
[50:39] the biatitudes. We've gone through those
[50:42] those
[50:43] blessings.
[50:45] And then he gets into and we're in
[50:48] Matthew chapter 25. He gets into he
[50:49] says, "You have heard it was said of old
[50:51] time, thou shalt not kill." He starts in
[50:52] the ten commandments into the law. He
[50:55] says, "I didn't come here to do away
[50:57] with the law. I came here to fulfill the
[50:58] law." And he says, "You've heard it said
[51:01] of old time, thou shalt not kill. And
[51:03] whosoever shall kill shall be in danger
[51:04] of judgment." The sixth commandment. But
[51:06] I say unto you, whosoever is angry with
[51:08] his brother without a cause shall be in
[51:09] danger of the judgment.
[51:11] Jesus is starting to work on the inside.
[51:15] The law was working on the outside. You
[51:18] have heard it said by them of old time,
[51:20] thou shalt not commit adultery. Seventh
[51:21] commandment. But I say unto you that
[51:23] whosoever looks on a woman to lust after
[51:25] her has committed adultery with her
[51:27] already in his heart. And Jesus talks
[51:30] about divorce, which we went over a
[51:32] couple weeks ago. And now Jesus is going
[51:35] to reference the eighth commandment.
[51:38] We know it as thou shalt not bear false
[51:40] witness and other state statements in
[51:43] the Torah about lying.
[51:46] We go to read. Let's start in Matthew
[51:48] 5:33. And let's get into our scriptures.
[51:52] It says this. Matthew chapter 5 verse
[51:56] 33. Again, you have heard that it has
[51:59] been said by them of old time, thou
[52:01] shalt not foresear thyself, but shalt
[52:03] perform unto the Lord thine knows. But I
[52:05] say unto you, swear not at all. Neither
[52:08] by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor
[52:10] by the earth, for it is his foottool,
[52:12] neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city
[52:15] of the great king. Neither shalt thou
[52:17] swear by thy head, because thou canst
[52:20] not make one hair white or black.
[52:25] Well, the sisters do today.
[52:30] I'm just kidding.
[52:32] But we can't.
[52:34] You have to dye it. Neither shalt thou
[52:38] swear by thy head because thou cannot
[52:39] cannot make one hair white or black. But
[52:42] let your comm communication be yay yay
[52:46] nay nay. For whatsoever is more than
[52:49] these cometh of evil.
[52:53] Now, it seems like these first couple
[52:55] script scriptures I read, it seems like
[52:58] they're about swearing an oath.
[53:01] And James,
[53:03] one of Jesus's disciples, his halfb
[53:06] brother,
[53:08] um, is probably quoting Jesus in his
[53:11] epistle when he writes this. James 5:12
[53:14] says, "But above all all, my brethren,
[53:16] do not swear either by heaven or by
[53:18] earth or with any or after any other
[53:20] oath, but let your yes be yes and your
[53:22] no be no, lest you fall into judgment."
[53:25] Same as what Jesus said on the sermon on
[53:26] the mount. So James was probably and
[53:28] you'll see many of the disciples will
[53:30] quote Jesus in their in their
[53:34] ministries. So many people read these
[53:36] scriptures in James and in Matthew and
[53:38] they come up with the tradition that we
[53:40] are not supposed to swear an oath.
[53:43] Court of law.
[53:48] Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole
[53:49] truth and nothing but the truth? So will
[53:50] help you God. I do.
[53:54] And then many Christians will say, well,
[53:57] we're not supposed to swear. We're not
[53:59] supposed to do that because James and
[54:01] Jesus said not to do it. So, I can't
[54:03] swear that oath.
[54:06] And friends, so often people look at the
[54:10] New Testament
[54:12] with an Old Testament mentality.
[54:16] Now, here's a rule. We're not allowed to
[54:18] do this. But remember, Jesus isn't
[54:20] working on the outside. Jesus is working
[54:23] on the inside. He wants a change of a
[54:25] heart of heart. And the point of this
[54:27] scripture, when you do that, you miss
[54:29] the whole point. When you say, "Okay,
[54:32] well, I'm not allowed to do that." No,
[54:34] no, no. You're missing the whole thing.
[54:36] The whole the the meaning behind that is
[54:39] Jesus says is saying that you should
[54:41] always be honest.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; You should never have to swear. You
[54:47] should never have to ever promise or or
[54:50] say, you know, I swear on my mother's
[54:51] grave or whatever. You never do that
[54:54] because every word that you say should
[54:56] be the truth.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Everything. And he's saying that if you
[55:00] have to swear, there's something that
[55:02] you're doing wrong before you have to
[55:04] swear.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Verse number 33 again. Again, you have
[55:10] heard that it hath been said by them of
[55:12] old time, thou shalt not forcewear
[55:14] thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord
[55:16] thine oaths. So the Jews is what he's
[55:19] saying here. The Jews just by tradition,
[55:21] they would swear by something greater
[55:23] than themselves. And we do the same
[55:25] thing as God is my witness. I never said
[55:29] that.
[55:31] God is always your witness. He hears it
[55:33] all.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; You know, I sw I I swear to God, you
[55:37] hear sometimes say, why are you swearing
[55:40] to God?
[55:42] Why won't you just speak the truth all
[55:44] the time?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; I swear by, as I said before, I swear by
[55:49] my mother's grave. Again, they're trying
[55:50] to add more credibility to your words
[55:53] when you should just always be telling
[55:54] the truth anyways.
[55:57] So the Jews had too much respect to
[55:59] swear by God. So they would swear by
[56:03] something a little bit lower than God,
[56:05] but still something greater than
[56:06] themselves. So they would swear they
[56:08] would say, "I swear by the temple or I
[56:11] swear by Jerusalem or I swear by
[56:14] heaven."
[56:16] And then saying these things was was
[56:18] something like saying I swear by
[56:20] something a little bit lower than God
[56:22] just to give me a little bit of wiggle
[56:24] room maybe in my statement. You see when
[56:26] you were kids you know I promise I
[56:29] didn't do that.
[56:33] That's not
[56:36] Jesus is saying don't do that.
[56:39] I'm not talking about opinions. I'm not
[56:42] talking about uh some people say, "Well,
[56:45] I'm just too honest." No, what you're
[56:47] really saying is, "I have no wisdom."
[56:50] And I say whatever comes into my mind.
[56:54] When people say, "I'm just too honest."
[56:56] Honey, do I look fat in this dress? It's
[56:59] like, don't lie,
[57:02] but use wisdom in your answer.
[57:07] You don't have to give your opinion all
[57:09] the time. It's like,
[57:15] do I look fat in this dress?
[57:18] And did you see the Dodgers won the
[57:19] World Series last night? 11 innings.
[57:24] No, you say something like, you know,
[57:25] that's I've never liked that dress.
[57:26] That's not my favorite dress. I'd rather
[57:28] you wear something else, you know. But
[57:30] don't don't just lie because then that
[57:32] lie will propagate into something else.
[57:36] And
[57:39] you should it should be addressed maybe.
[57:43] So I'm I'm I'm gesting a little bit. But
[57:48] even something like that, something as
[57:50] simple as that, it can result in
[57:51] something bad if you lie about that. So
[57:55] what God said in the Old Testament
[57:58] was really that you shouldn't swear,
[58:01] but that you shouldn't do that you
[58:03] should do what you promised that you
[58:06] would do that you should do what you
[58:09] say. He's not saying don't swear. He's
[58:12] saying do what? Do what you promise to
[58:13] do. Do what you say. But I say unto you,
[58:16] verse number 34, swear not at all,
[58:19] neither by heaven, for it is God's
[58:21] throne. Remember the Jews would say, I
[58:23] swear by heaven. He's like, "Don't do
[58:25] that. That's God's throne. It's still
[58:27] God,
[58:28] nor by the earth,
[58:31] for it is his foottool. Neither by
[58:33] Jerusalem, for it is the city of the
[58:34] great king." You can't swear by these
[58:36] things. This is all God. So, you're
[58:38] really just you're just lying. Don't
[58:41] Don't do that. It doesn't add it should
[58:43] not add any credibility to your
[58:45] statement at all. Neither shalt thou
[58:47] swear by thy head because thou canst not
[58:49] make one hair white or black, but let
[58:51] your communications be yay. Yay nay nay
[58:55] for whatsoever
[58:57] um whatsoever is more imp more than
[58:59] these cometh of evil. Big statement
[59:03] right there from our Lord Jesus. New
[59:05] International Version says all you need
[59:08] to say is simply yes or no. Anything
[59:12] beyond this comes from the evil one.
[59:15] Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus said 56 times
[59:22] in the book of Matthew, I tell you the
[59:25] truth. You read verily, verily. That's
[59:28] all that we don't talk, we don't say
[59:30] verily, verily today, but we do say, I
[59:32] tell you the truth. And that's what he
[59:33] was saying.
[59:35] I tell you the truth.
[59:37] Like 50 times in the book of John, he
[59:40] says the same thing. I tell you the
[59:42] truth.
[59:44] The fact is that Jesus was the truth.
[59:47] And what I'm trying to get at is how
[59:49] important it is. The truth is John 14:6
[59:54] Jesus said unto him, "I am the way, the
[59:56] truth, and the life. No one can come to
[59:58] the father except through me."
[1:00:03] John chapter 4 says this, "But the hour
[1:00:06] is coming, and now is Jesus speaking,
[1:00:08] when true worshippers will worship the
[1:00:10] father in spirit and truth.
[1:00:13] For the father is seeking such to
[1:00:15] worship him. God is spirit and those who
[1:00:18] worship him must worship in spirit and
[1:00:22] truth. We talk about the spirit all the
[1:00:25] time. But do we talk about truth as
[1:00:27] much? It's both.
[1:00:30] We should never ever speak a lie or
[1:00:33] speak a halftruth or propagate a lie.
[1:00:39] Facebook started in 2004
[1:00:43] and that kicked off modern social media.
[1:00:48] Have you ever shared a post,
[1:00:52] shared a Tik Tok video, shared a YouTube
[1:00:53] video, shared shared an email, shared
[1:00:56] whatever it is? Have you ever forwarded
[1:00:59] something like that?
[1:01:02] You put your name on that post.
[1:01:06] whatever it is, you're sending it out.
[1:01:09] You're sharing a news article that some
[1:01:13] whatever it might be that this celebrity
[1:01:15] is is heading up a um child trafficking
[1:01:20] scheme or something like that or Donald
[1:01:23] Trump's working with the Pope to create
[1:01:25] a new world order or something like
[1:01:27] that. You see that? You see it? You you
[1:01:29] forward it along. It's harmless, right?
[1:01:32] Well, I didn't write it. I just
[1:01:34] forwarded it. Here, read this. I don't
[1:01:37] know if it's true, but read us, man.
[1:01:39] Man, that's messed up, isn't it? Your
[1:01:42] name, both physically and spiritually.
[1:01:47] Your name is now tied forever to that
[1:01:51] thing that you just forwarded.
[1:01:55] Your posts on social media are forever
[1:01:58] recorded on on cyerspace. You can't if
[1:02:00] you delete them, they're still there. If
[1:02:02] you forward something now, you are
[1:02:04] tagged with that article.
[1:02:07] You are now part of that and you own it.
[1:02:11] If it's a lie, if it's an exaggeration
[1:02:14] of the truth, you are part of it. You
[1:02:17] forwarded it.
[1:02:19] It is now
[1:02:22] within you. It is now on you
[1:02:25] and it can't be deleted. And everything
[1:02:28] that we say too, there's God's recording
[1:02:30] angels. We have this in cyerspace in the
[1:02:32] natural world and we have God's
[1:02:34] recording angels recording everything
[1:02:37] that we say and tying it right back to
[1:02:40] our name.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; You hear something about someone, you
[1:02:43] repeat it. If it's a lie or whatever,
[1:02:46] now you are guilty of that lie.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; If it's an article about something,
[1:02:52] whatever it is, and you forward it, now
[1:02:54] you are part of that lie.
[1:02:57] Remember the last lesson? If your hand
[1:02:58] causes you to sin, cut it off. If your
[1:03:00] eye causes you to sin, gouge it out.
[1:03:03] Because it's better to lose one part of
[1:03:07] your body than for your whole body to go
[1:03:09] to hell.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; The stakes are very high. We think, "Oh,
[1:03:15] it's just an article. I didn't write it,
[1:03:17] but you forwarded it. You sanctioned
[1:03:20] it." Well, I don't know if it's true,
[1:03:21] but
[1:03:23] and you still propagated it. I don't
[1:03:26] think we understand the seriousness
[1:03:28] of our words and everything that we do
[1:03:31] every single day. Jesus said,
[1:03:35] "If you just hate a man, you're
[1:03:38] you are in danger of going to hell."
[1:03:43] There's a
[1:03:45] awful thing that happened. It's called
[1:03:48] the big lie. I'm going to read I um I
[1:03:52] wrote this from different articles and I
[1:03:54] want to read it to get it right, but uh
[1:03:58] the protocols of the elders of Zion.
[1:04:00] Could you put up that picture?
[1:04:03] It's one of the most evil publications
[1:04:04] ever printed.
[1:04:08] And I'll read I'll read what it is.
[1:04:10] Thank you. You can take it down. The
[1:04:12] Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a
[1:04:15] fabricated text purporting purporting to
[1:04:18] detail a Jewish plot for global
[1:04:21] domination. Largely plagiarized from
[1:04:23] several earlier sources, it was first
[1:04:25] published in Imperial Russia in 1903,
[1:04:28] translated into multiple languages, and
[1:04:30] disseminated internationally in the
[1:04:31] early part of the 20th century. It
[1:04:33] played a key part in popularizering
[1:04:37] popular popularizing
[1:04:39] belief in the international Jew in an
[1:04:42] international Jewish conspiracy.
[1:04:44] The text was exposed as fraudulent by a
[1:04:48] British newspaper in 1921 and by a
[1:04:51] German newspaper in 1924. So friends, if
[1:04:53] there is something that's wrong, I don't
[1:04:56] believe that we must keep quiet. I
[1:04:59] believe that we can stand up and say,
[1:05:00] "No, this is wrong.
[1:05:03] But we don't want to take it an a step
[1:05:06] further
[1:05:08] into gossip. But beginning in 1933,
[1:05:11] versions of the work were assigned by
[1:05:13] some German teachers as if they were
[1:05:15] factual to be read by German school
[1:05:18] children throughout Nazi Germany. It
[1:05:21] remains widely available in numerous
[1:05:23] languages, in print, and on the
[1:05:25] internet, and continues to be presented
[1:05:27] by anti-semitic groups as a genuine
[1:05:30] document.
[1:05:31] It has been described as probably the
[1:05:35] most influential work of anti-semitism
[1:05:38] ever written.
[1:05:42] Although Nazi Germany perpetuated
[1:05:45] centuries old lies about the Jews, this
[1:05:48] time those lies would have their most
[1:05:50] devastating effect. Like never before,
[1:05:52] anti-semitism was manifested in a
[1:05:54] sweeping national policy. This is in
[1:05:57] Germany known as the final solution.
[1:06:00] which sought to eliminate Jews from the
[1:06:02] face of the earth.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; To accomplish this, Adolf Hitler and his
[1:06:08] minister of propaganda, Joseph Gobles,
[1:06:11] launched a massive campaign to convince
[1:06:14] the German people that the Jews were
[1:06:16] their enemies.
[1:06:18] Having taken over the press, they spread
[1:06:20] lies about lies blaming Jews for all of
[1:06:23] Germany's problems, including the loss
[1:06:24] of World War I. One outrageous lie
[1:06:28] known as blood liel dating back to the
[1:06:31] Middle Ages claimed that Jews engaged in
[1:06:33] the ritual killings of Christian
[1:06:35] children and use their blood in
[1:06:36] unleavened bread eaten at Passover
[1:06:40] and a lie.
[1:06:43] Using the Jews as a scapegoat, Hitler
[1:06:45] and his followers orchestrated what they
[1:06:47] called the big lie.
[1:06:51] This theory states that no matter how
[1:06:54] big the lie is, people will believe it
[1:06:57] if you repeat it enough.
[1:07:00] Something as outlandish as those things
[1:07:03] that I just read, if you keep repeating
[1:07:05] it and repeating it, people will teach
[1:07:08] their children those things. People will
[1:07:10] start believing those things and they
[1:07:13] will present them as the truth. If you
[1:07:16] keep repeating it enough, no matter how
[1:07:17] big the lie,
[1:07:20] think on religion in these things, in
[1:07:23] this context, a burning in your bosom,
[1:07:26] say the Mormons,
[1:07:28] something that might seem scriptural.
[1:07:31] You're praying about about accepting
[1:07:34] this Mormon faith, and it might seem
[1:07:36] scriptural after you get this burning in
[1:07:38] your bosom, but it's not. But if you say
[1:07:41] it over and over, you think that it is
[1:07:44] the word because it's said so often. You
[1:07:46] think that it's in the Bible when it's
[1:07:48] not.
[1:07:49] Catholics, they constantly give homage
[1:07:52] to Mary.
[1:07:54] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is is
[1:07:56] with thee. Blessed art thou amongst
[1:07:58] women, and blessed is the fruit of thy
[1:07:59] womb, Jesus, now and at the hour of our
[1:08:01] death. Over and over and over, they say
[1:08:04] it,
[1:08:05] and then it becomes scripture to them.
[1:08:09] becomes real. Oh, well that's that's
[1:08:11] what's the word says. It is not what the
[1:08:13] word says because you won't take the
[1:08:15] time to stand back and question how you
[1:08:17] believe and dig into the Bible and say
[1:08:19] is what I believe right?
[1:08:24] And it happens so often things that
[1:08:28] people think this is a fact. This is how
[1:08:30] God speaks. This is exactly what it is.
[1:08:33] And it's said over and over and over.
[1:08:35] And then they teach their children the
[1:08:37] same thing over and over and it just
[1:08:39] becomes real. This is just how I
[1:08:41] believe. This is just a fact. And when
[1:08:43] in fact that it is just a big lie and it
[1:08:46] has done nothing but pull us away from
[1:08:48] the Bible and Christ.
[1:08:51] The thing that I say a lot, it's always
[1:08:53] Christ. Plus,
[1:08:55] anytime you add something in there that
[1:08:58] diverts your mind, diverts your eyes
[1:09:02] from Jesus Christ and his word, which
[1:09:04] points to him. Every every word in the
[1:09:07] Bible, as we were talking the other day,
[1:09:09] points to Jesus Christ. And if anything
[1:09:13] comes in and points you to something
[1:09:15] else,
[1:09:17] question it.
[1:09:21] One of the stipulations for the peace
[1:09:23] agreement between the Palestinians
[1:09:26] and the Israelis was that the
[1:09:28] Palestinians stop teaching their
[1:09:29] children that it's an honor and morally
[1:09:32] correct to kill Jews.
[1:09:36] Teaching their children.
[1:09:38] The big lie. Oh, it's good. They're not
[1:09:41] real people.
[1:09:44] They're evil people. And it's said over
[1:09:46] and over enough to where they believe
[1:09:48] it. And it's normal when we raise our
[1:09:52] children up with rhetoric.
[1:09:55] How can we expect them expect them not
[1:09:57] to believe it?
[1:10:00] And then they will teach their children
[1:10:02] and their children and their children.
[1:10:04] And I go back to the Mormon faith.
[1:10:07] It was all made up in the beginning.
[1:10:10] And then
[1:10:12] you have 10 million people or whatever
[1:10:15] it is believing this Book of Mormon that
[1:10:19] was a that wasn't even real.
[1:10:24] We should never just believe what we
[1:10:26] hear. Whether it's on the news or social
[1:10:28] media or something that we've grown up
[1:10:30] saying or something we always hear at
[1:10:33] church.
[1:10:35] Our words have meaning. friends. I was
[1:10:38] flipping through YouTube this morning
[1:10:39] and um looking for something that
[1:10:42] something else and I saw a recent video
[1:10:45] came up of a minister
[1:10:47] calling a man
[1:10:49] that I used to work for when I was in
[1:10:51] Jeffersonville calling him the
[1:10:52] Antichrist because his do his doctrines
[1:10:54] were wrong.
[1:10:56] I don't mind disagreeing with someone,
[1:10:58] but when you start raising it the to the
[1:11:01] level
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; of saying that he's possessed by a demon
[1:11:05] or something like that, whoa, you've
[1:11:07] gone too far. Now you're getting back
[1:11:10] over here where they were in Nazi
[1:11:13] Germany or wherever it is, and you're
[1:11:15] propagating these lies. And then people
[1:11:17] are going on and I saw the comments on
[1:11:19] his on his uh YouTube page.
[1:11:23] And it it was like, "Oh, brother, thank
[1:11:26] you for telling us the truth. Thank you
[1:11:27] for doing this.
[1:11:29] What do you What are we doing calling
[1:11:32] each other names like that? I don't care
[1:11:34] how much I disagree with a brother.
[1:11:37] We should never
[1:11:39] attack someone like that and calling
[1:11:41] them an awful name like that. That is
[1:11:43] horrible."
[1:11:45] And that propagates hatred among the
[1:11:47] people. And then it propagates a church
[1:11:50] that has a chip on its shoulder and
[1:11:52] that's willing to say bad things about
[1:11:54] other thing other things and willing to
[1:11:56] to share these videos. When you say
[1:11:59] things like that, you are outside the
[1:12:01] word of God.
[1:12:04] I mean, I believe it's in the book of
[1:12:06] Jude.
[1:12:08] The Bible says that even Michael the
[1:12:11] archangel
[1:12:13] did not bring bring a railing accusation
[1:12:18] against the devil. But he said, "God
[1:12:20] rebuke you. Satan,
[1:12:24] even Michael the archangel didn't do
[1:12:26] it." And here we are saying bad things,
[1:12:29] saying these things and propagating
[1:12:31] these lies about other people.
[1:12:34] We are in direct violation of what Jesus
[1:12:37] said in Matthew chapter 5 and all
[1:12:39] throughout his ministry and in what the
[1:12:41] disciples said.
[1:12:43] I disagree with a whole lot of things in
[1:12:45] the Catholic Church and what it stands
[1:12:46] for. But I would not lower myself to
[1:12:49] saying that even the pope is the
[1:12:50] antichrist
[1:12:52] before these conspiracy theories and you
[1:12:54] and your name is tied to each one.
[1:12:57] Friends,
[1:12:59] what what if the post is wrong? Now
[1:13:02] you've lied and have you repented of it.
[1:13:06] And it's so easy today to not repent.
[1:13:09] It's like, "Oh, well that one wasn't
[1:13:10] wrong or or or that one was wrong. Well,
[1:13:12] I'll just forward the next one."
[1:13:16] And if it doesn't happen, you just go on
[1:13:17] to the next post.
[1:13:20] Jesus said, "But let your communication
[1:13:22] be yay, yay, and nay nay. For whatsoever
[1:13:26] is more than that, more than these
[1:13:28] things comes from evil.
[1:13:40] There's a a man
[1:13:42] that prophesied
[1:13:44] that uh you probably heard of it that
[1:13:47] the rapture was going to happen on
[1:13:49] September 23rd and 24th. How many have
[1:13:51] heard that? Anybody see that? Oh, more
[1:13:54] than I thought.
[1:13:57] [sighs]
[1:13:57] after he predicted that rapture would
[1:13:59] happen on on September 23rd and 24th. I
[1:14:03] mean, they were on there. They were
[1:14:04] doing a live feed. They were expected to
[1:14:05] be taken up and everything was going to
[1:14:06] go blank and the rapture was going to
[1:14:08] happen. It didn't happen. So, then he
[1:14:12] goes and he changes his prophecy. Oh,
[1:14:13] well, maybe I got the numbers wrong. And
[1:14:16] he he sets another date. Three times
[1:14:18] this guy did that.
[1:14:20] And the last one of the last things that
[1:14:25] he said, I went on there and I saw some
[1:14:27] of the of the comments made on his
[1:14:30] YouTube page. This is the guy prophesied
[1:14:33] September 23rd, prophesied whatever it
[1:14:36] was in October, prophesied another. It
[1:14:38] didn't happen every time.
[1:14:41] Here's some of the comments. I'm a
[1:14:44] Nigerian. I got my own confirmation in
[1:14:46] December 2024 before you came out.
[1:14:49] Nothing can change my mind. The man's
[1:14:51] name is Joshua. I love you, brother
[1:14:53] Joshua. Failed. A failed prophecy, but
[1:14:56] I'm going to dig in.
[1:14:59] I believe you, Joshua. Stand strong. We
[1:15:01] understand you, brother. Jesus is
[1:15:03] coming.
[1:15:04] Sounds good.
[1:15:06] September 23rd, 24th did not fail. But
[1:15:10] is the start of the rapture event that
[1:15:12] extends through the Feast of
[1:15:12] Tabernacles, which is over, by the way.
[1:15:15] The rapture time frame now being watched
[1:15:17] is for October 13th and 14th or shimini
[1:15:21] at
[1:15:22] past. It's believed that the current
[1:15:25] delay is because of the 21 because of a
[1:15:27] 21 day a 21-day war in heaven that
[1:15:30] occurs before the start of the rapture
[1:15:31] great tribulation. And he goes on for
[1:15:33] paragraphs to explain this. Digging in
[1:15:35] say I was not wrong. I'm I'm right.
[1:15:39] Just a comment. Another comment. When
[1:15:42] Jesus and his brothers were supposed to
[1:15:44] go to the Feast of Tabernacles together,
[1:15:45] Jesus decided not to go yet because he
[1:15:48] was waiting for his father's timing.
[1:15:49] Just because he didn't come on time
[1:15:51] doesn't mean that he's not coming. Keep
[1:15:53] your lamp keep your lamps trimmed with
[1:15:55] oil with oil. Again, making an excuse.
[1:15:58] Sometimes it's time to step back and
[1:16:00] say, you know what, I was wrong.
[1:16:02] But this stuff spreads around the world
[1:16:04] now with social media. Brother Joshua, I
[1:16:07] see the spirit of God rest upon you
[1:16:09] because of this scripture, 1 Peter 4.
[1:16:12] If you are insulted for the name of
[1:16:13] Christ, you are blessed because the
[1:16:15] spirit the spirit of glory and God rests
[1:16:17] upon you. All the insulting that's going
[1:16:20] on now is only because you stand with
[1:16:22] our Lord Jesus Christ. Take your reward
[1:16:24] for great great is your reward in
[1:16:25] heaven. We love you, brother.
[1:16:28] I understand you don't want to condemn
[1:16:29] the man,
[1:16:31] but he got up there and told the world
[1:16:33] that this was going to happen.
[1:16:36] Another one. I was asking God for weeks
[1:16:38] for confirmation about a rapture that
[1:16:40] you said. He gave me one, but I wasn't
[1:16:42] satisi satisfied. So I gave then he gave
[1:16:44] me another confirmation. Then yesterday
[1:16:46] while I was taking a nap, he brought he
[1:16:48] brought my spirit to an open field. And
[1:16:50] then when I looked up in the sky, it was
[1:16:52] perfectly blue. No clouds except the
[1:16:54] numbers that were written in the blue
[1:16:55] sky. 23 23 23. And they was and the way
[1:16:58] it was written is like God using a a
[1:17:01] board pen, but it was a cloud. I was
[1:17:03] shocked. When I woke up, I felt so heavy
[1:17:06] because people out there are sleeping
[1:17:07] and numb.
[1:17:10] of supporting a false prophecy.
[1:17:14] And these people are saying that I was
[1:17:18] right when I believed it
[1:17:22] and I passed it on to everybody else and
[1:17:25] now I'm just going to dig in and say
[1:17:28] that I'm right.
[1:17:32] social media.
[1:17:34] When you forward
[1:17:37] one of these posts,
[1:17:41] your name is written right on there
[1:17:44] forever.
[1:17:48] When you post something,
[1:17:51] it is you that's saying it.
[1:17:55] Let your yay be yay and your nay be nay.
[1:17:58] It's not okay, friends. It is not all
[1:18:01] right to post something wrong or say
[1:18:04] something wrong and just go on to the
[1:18:06] next thing.
[1:18:09] Jesus is saying that here. He's saying
[1:18:12] everything that you should that you say
[1:18:14] should be truthful.
[1:18:17] I don't have time
[1:18:20] to go through these, but let me just
[1:18:21] read some scriptures. Just sit back and
[1:18:23] listen to these Old Testament and New
[1:18:26] Testament. Zechariah 8 says this,
[1:18:30] "These are the things [snorts] that you
[1:18:32] are to do. Speak the truth to each other
[1:18:35] and render true and sound judgment in
[1:18:37] your courts. Do not plot evil against
[1:18:39] each other and do not love to swear
[1:18:41] falsely. I hate this, declares the
[1:18:44] Lord." Psalm 15. Lord, who may dwell in
[1:18:49] your sacred tent? Who may live on your
[1:18:51] holy mountain? The one whose walk is
[1:18:55] blameless, who does what is righteous,
[1:18:57] who who speaks the truth from their
[1:19:00] heart, whose tongue utters no slander,
[1:19:03] who does no wrong to a neighbor and
[1:19:05] casts no slurs on others.
[1:19:08] Mark 7, the Lord Jesus, what comes out
[1:19:11] of a person is what defiles them. For it
[1:19:14] is from within, out of a person's heart,
[1:19:17] that the evil thoughts come. Sexual
[1:19:19] immorality and theft and murder,
[1:19:21] adultery, greed, malice, deceit,
[1:19:23] lwdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and
[1:19:25] folly. All these things come from the
[1:19:28] inside and defile a person. Colossians
[1:19:32] chapter 3, the Apostle Paul, you used to
[1:19:34] walk in these ways. He's talking about
[1:19:36] sinful life in the life that you once
[1:19:38] lived. But now you must also rid
[1:19:41] yourselves of all things as these anger
[1:19:44] and rage, malice, slander, filthy
[1:19:48] language from your lips. Do not lie to
[1:19:50] each other since you have taken off your
[1:19:51] old self with its practices and have put
[1:19:54] on the new self which is being renewed
[1:19:57] in the knowledge in the image of its
[1:20:00] creator. See how Jesus
[1:20:02] Jesus went after the inner man, not the
[1:20:05] outside. Proverbs chapter 8. To fear the
[1:20:09] Lord is to hate evil. I hate pride and
[1:20:13] arrogance. Evil behavior and perverse
[1:20:16] speech.
[1:20:18] Proverbs 11, a gossip betrays a
[1:20:21] confidence, but a trustworthy person
[1:20:24] keeps a secret.
[1:20:26] Think about social media.
[1:20:29] Proverbs 2019, "A gossip betrays a
[1:20:32] confidence, so avoid anyone who talks
[1:20:34] too much.
[1:20:37] James chapter 1. Those who consider
[1:20:40] themselves religious and yet do not keep
[1:20:42] a tight reign on their tongues deceive
[1:20:45] themselves and their religion is
[1:20:48] worthless.
[1:20:52] They do not keep a tight reign in their
[1:20:54] tongues. They deceive themselves and
[1:20:55] their religion is worthless.
[1:20:58] Friends, think about it. Think about the
[1:21:01] the bar that that the Lord sets before
[1:21:04] us.
[1:21:06] And we think just I'm not against social
[1:21:09] media by any means. I think social media
[1:21:11] can be used for the Lord. I really do.
[1:21:14] But when we are just forwarding things
[1:21:16] along,
[1:21:18] what if they're wrong?
[1:21:21] What if it's false? Now you have lied to
[1:21:25] as many people as you sent it to and
[1:21:26] however many people they sent it to. The
[1:21:28] worship team can come.
[1:21:32] We have a friend. We have a saying,
[1:21:34] friends, that a man is only as as good
[1:21:36] as his word.
[1:21:38] We've heard that. Well, you're only as
[1:21:40] good as your word. I'll go a little
[1:21:42] further to say that a man is his word.
[1:21:45] That's how important our honesty is. We
[1:21:48] are what we say. John chapter 1 verse
[1:21:51] one says, "In the beginning was the word
[1:21:55] and the word was with God and the word
[1:21:58] was God."
[1:22:01] So God is his word.
[1:22:05] So we made in the image of God are also
[1:22:08] our word. How important is honesty in
[1:22:11] our lives? How important is telling the
[1:22:13] truth?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I'll close with Matthew chapter 5:33.
[1:22:18] I'll read I'll read it again.
[1:22:23] Hopefully it's a with a little bit more
[1:22:25] understanding this time. Matthew chapter
[1:22:27] 5:33. Again, you have heard that it hath
[1:22:31] been said by them of old time, thou
[1:22:33] shalt not foresear thyself, but shalt
[1:22:36] perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I
[1:22:39] say unto you, swear not at all, neither
[1:22:42] by heaven, for it is God's throne,
[1:22:43] neither by the earth, for it is God's
[1:22:45] foottool, neither by Jerusalem, for it
[1:22:47] is the city of the great king. Neither
[1:22:49] shalt thou swear by thy head, because
[1:22:51] thou cut not make one hair white or
[1:22:53] black. But let your communication be
[1:22:58] let your communication be
[1:23:03] everything that you say.
[1:23:06] Let your communication be yay yay
[1:23:11] nay nay
[1:23:13] for whatsoever is more than these comes
[1:23:16] from evil.
[1:23:22] Jesus said these things.
[1:23:26] And do you see when we deviate, when we
[1:23:29] stray a little bit
[1:23:33] from the scriptures,
[1:23:35] do you see it can create a big lie.
[1:23:39] We see politicians do it all the time.
[1:23:41] The Russian dossier for Trump. They knew
[1:23:44] it was wrong in the beginning and they
[1:23:47] purposely spread it.
[1:23:50] Lies. And then we hear them so much and
[1:23:54] they become real.
[1:23:56] The things that we say,
[1:23:59] the things that you teach your children,
[1:24:02] the things that you say to each other,
[1:24:05] the little sayings that we have,
[1:24:08] go back and say, you know what, is that
[1:24:10] scriptural that I say these things,
[1:24:13] the religious words that we say?
[1:24:17] go back to this Bible
[1:24:19] and say, "Is that what this Bible
[1:24:23] teaches or is it just that what I
[1:24:25] learned?"
[1:24:28] He raises the bar high and he puts it
[1:24:31] upon the believer
[1:24:33] and says, "You do these things. If your
[1:24:37] hand causes you to sin, cut it off."
[1:24:40] He's not saying, "Get a saw and saw off
[1:24:42] your hand." He's saying, "Get to the
[1:24:44] root of the matter.
[1:24:47] If your eye causes you to sin,
[1:24:50] gouge it out. He's not saying to spoon
[1:24:52] it out because you just look at the bad
[1:24:55] stuff with the other eye. He's saying
[1:24:57] get to the root of the matter. And here
[1:25:01] he's saying, don't swear by anything.
[1:25:04] You shouldn't need to swear. Yeah, if
[1:25:06] you have to go to court and you have to
[1:25:07] put your hand on the Bible, that's fine.
[1:25:10] But your word all the time, every day
[1:25:14] should never have a lie in it. Never.
[1:25:20] And Jesus warns us that anything more
[1:25:24] than the truth
[1:25:28] cometh of evil.
[1:25:32] Very
[1:25:34] the Lord Jesus. As I said before, when I
[1:25:36] read this sermon on the mount,
[1:25:40] it's why I like in my ministry, I
[1:25:42] believe the Lord's led me to just read
[1:25:46] the whole
[1:25:48] don't skip over. Don't take a verse here
[1:25:50] and over there and over there and try to
[1:25:51] put them into a sermon. Read it all in
[1:25:53] context.
[1:25:55] One of the things that when you read it
[1:25:57] in context, you can't just skip over
[1:25:59] part of it because maybe I'm not living
[1:26:02] up to it or maybe our church doesn't
[1:26:04] think that that's important.
[1:26:07] If it's important enough to put into the
[1:26:08] Bible, if it's important enough for
[1:26:10] Jesus's day, it's to say it's important
[1:26:12] enough for the man for us to believe.
[1:26:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:30] I speak Jesus, brother Tim. First verse.
[1:26:43] I just want to speak the name of Jesus.
[1:26:50] over every heart and every mouth.

[1:26:57] Cuz I know there is peace within your
[1:27:00] presence.
[1:27:03] I speak Jesus.
[1:27:06] Verse two.
[1:27:11] I just want to speak the name of Jesus
[1:27:14] [music]
[1:27:18] till every dark [singing]
[1:27:20] addiction starts to break. [music]

[1:27:28] is freedom.

[1:27:59] Burn like a fire.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; I just want [singing] to speak the name
[1:28:11] of Jesus
[1:28:15] over [singing] fear and all anxiety.

[1:28:25] depression,

[1:29:22] the holy name.
[1:29:25] Jesus.

[1:29:30] Oh,

[1:29:33] mountains.

[1:29:56] Oh,

[1:29:59] Jesus from the mountains.
[1:30:03] Jesus in the streets.
[1:30:06] Jesus [music and singing] in the
[1:30:08] darkness over every enemy.
[1:30:13] Jesus for my family. I speak the
[1:30:17] [singing] holy name
[1:30:20] Jesus.
[1:30:22] Cuz your name is power. Cuz your name is
[1:30:27] power.

[1:30:38] Oh,
[1:30:39] break every stronghold.
[1:30:43] Shine through the shadows.
[1:30:46] Burn like a fire.
[1:30:52] I just want to speak the name [singing]
[1:30:55] of Jesus
[1:31:00] over [singing] every heart and every
[1:31:03] mouth
[1:31:06] cuz I know there's [singing]
[1:31:08] peace within your presence.
[1:31:13] I speak Jesus
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:31:20] I assume the Apostle James.
[1:31:24] The pastor of Jerusalem church
[1:31:27] was quoting the Lord Jesus when he said
[1:31:29] this. But above all, my brethren, do not
[1:31:31] swear
[1:31:33] either by heaven or by earth or with any
[1:31:35] other or with any other oath. But let
[1:31:38] your yes be yes and your no be no, lest
[1:31:42] you fall into judgment.
[1:31:47] As for us, the same friends, be honest.
[1:31:51] The Bible commands it.
[1:31:54] Love one another. Be honest with one
[1:31:57] another. Be careful. Don't take anything
[1:32:00] lightly. Even if it's a if it's a Tik
[1:32:03] Tok post or or it's a YouTube video,
[1:32:06] take it seriously
[1:32:09] because it says here, lest you fall into
[1:32:11] judgment.
[1:32:14] These are perilous times. As the Bible
[1:32:16] said, we should use caution in
[1:32:19] everything we do. Don't let a negative
[1:32:21] word about anyone anyone come out of
[1:32:23] your mouth.
[1:32:25] Be positive.
[1:32:29] It doesn't mean don't stand up against
[1:32:30] something that's wrong,
[1:32:33] but it does mean don't propagate
[1:32:36] anything that's questionable and don't
[1:32:38] call anyone names and insult anyone.
[1:32:41] Jesus said a few verses before, he said,
[1:32:43] "Call no man Raqqa." It's calling a man
[1:32:45] a name.
[1:32:47] Calling him worthless.
[1:32:49] Should never do that, friends. As I
[1:32:51] said, serious times. Amen.
[1:32:56] I hope you feel good.
[1:33:02] [applause]
[1:33:06] I'll tell you what, if you really read
[1:33:09] Jesus's preaching,
[1:33:11] like I talked about the rubble out
[1:33:13] there, he reduces us to a pile of
[1:33:16] rubble,
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; but then he rebuilds it. And boy, that
[1:33:20] rebuilding feels good, man. It feels
[1:33:23] good.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; It feels so just He's good. He is good.
[1:33:30] He loves us. And I'm thankful that he
[1:33:33] gives us correction because we need it.
[1:33:35] I need it. You need it.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; And if we think that we don't need
[1:33:39] correction, then we really need
[1:33:41] correction.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:33:46] Our Father, we thank you.
[1:33:49] We thank you, Lord, that this sermon was
[1:33:52] recorded, that we might read it.
[1:33:55] And Lord,
[1:33:58] it's hard, Father, it's hard to even
[1:34:01] move past one verse, just one sentence
[1:34:04] Jesus said.
[1:34:06] It's hard to just move past them because
[1:34:08] it's there's so much wisdom in
[1:34:09] everything that he said.
[1:34:12] Oh God, we thank you. Thank you for the
[1:34:14] correction
[1:34:15] that this word brings. And Lord, I want
[1:34:18] to do better.
[1:34:20] I want my yay to be yay and my nay to be
[1:34:23] nay.
[1:34:24] I want people to look at me and say that
[1:34:27] every word that that man says is true.
[1:34:31] Every word I want them to look at our
[1:34:33] congregation. Every word that that woman
[1:34:34] says is the truth.
[1:34:38] She never has to swear. He never has to
[1:34:39] swear. He never has to put his name his
[1:34:41] hand on the Bible. His words are true.
[1:34:45] And Lord, your words are true.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And as you said, I am the truth.
[1:34:52] Oh God, we thank you for the truth.
[1:34:56] Now Lord, as we go, pray that your hand
[1:34:58] would be upon us.
[1:35:01] Lord, may we be strong in your spirit,
[1:35:04] living your word
[1:35:07] and Lord, getting better every day.
[1:35:08] Forgive us of our sins. Forgive us of
[1:35:10] our failures.
[1:35:12] And Lord, we claim the blood of Jesus
[1:35:15] Christ over our sins. And we are
[1:35:18] grateful and we are a happy people that
[1:35:21] you've given us what you've given us in
[1:35:22] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:35:26] Have one more village.
[1:35:28] I pledge allegiance to the lamb.
[1:35:32] These Christians had one question.
[1:35:35] Renounce Jesus Christ and live
[1:35:38] or don't renounce him and die.
[1:35:42] Will you renounce him? Yes or no? And
[1:35:45] they said, "No, I will not." And they
[1:35:48] gave their lives. How many people today,
[1:35:52] this very morning, if someone tells you,
[1:35:57] "Renounce the Lord Jesus and walk away
[1:35:59] from this thing called Christianity
[1:36:02] [music] and you'll live and you'll
[1:36:03] prosper."
[1:36:07] How many people would want to do that
[1:36:09] versus how many people would say, "You
[1:36:11] know what? I'll take my way with the
[1:36:12] Lord's despised few." How many people
[1:36:15] will take their way with Jesus Christ
[1:36:17] today?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Today, it's not dying for him. That's
[1:36:23] easier,
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Today, it's living
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; for him. So, will you play? Would you
[1:36:29] pledge allegiance to the lamb this
[1:36:31] morning? Pledge allegiance. Give him
[1:36:34] your life. [applause] Give the lamb your
[1:36:37] life. Say, "Lord, I pledge allegiance to
[1:36:38] you. I will walk in your spirit. I will
[1:36:42] be your servant. Lord, I give my life to
[1:36:45] you." Will you pledge allegiance to the
[1:36:46] lamb this morning, Brother? Verse one.
[1:36:52] I have heard
[1:36:54] how Christians [singing]
[1:36:57] long
[1:36:58] ago
[1:37:00] were brought before
[1:37:05] a trend [singing and music] stone.
[1:37:08] They were told
[1:37:10] that he would spare [singing]
[1:37:15] their lives
[1:37:17] if they would reounce [singing]
[1:37:21] the name
[1:37:23] of [music] Christ.
[1:37:25] But one by [singing] one
[1:37:29] they chose to die.
[1:37:33] the son of God.
[1:37:37] They [singing] would not deny.
[1:37:41] Like a great
[1:37:43] angelic
[1:37:46] choir
[1:37:48] sings, [music]
[1:37:49] I can almost [singing]
[1:37:51] hear
[1:37:53] their voicees
[1:37:56] ring. [music]
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Now sing it to him. I pledge
[1:38:00] alance
[1:38:02] to
[1:38:04] the lamb.
[1:38:06] With all [music and singing]
[1:38:07] my strength,
[1:38:10] with all I am, I will seek
[1:38:16] to honor
[1:38:19] his
[1:38:20] commands.
[1:38:22] I pledge
[1:38:24] alce [singing]
[1:38:26] [music] to
[1:38:30] the land.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Now the years
[1:38:34] Now the years have [singing] come
[1:38:38] and the [music] years have gone,
[1:38:42] but the cause of Jesus
[1:38:47] still goes on.
[1:38:50] Now our time has come
[1:38:54] to count the cost,
[1:38:58] to reject this world
[1:39:02] or embrace
[1:39:04] the cross. [music]
[1:39:06] And one by one,
[1:39:10] let us live our lives
[1:39:14] for the one [singing] who died
[1:39:18] to give us life. [singing]
[1:39:22] Till the trumpet sounds
[1:39:26] on that final day. [music]
[1:39:29] Oh, let us humbly stand [singing]
[1:39:34] and boldly
[1:39:36] say [music]
[1:39:38] it.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I pledge [singing]
[1:39:40] alance
[1:39:42] [music] to
[1:39:44] the lamb.
[1:39:46] With all [singing]
[1:39:48] my strength, [music]
[1:39:50] with all I am, [singing]
[1:39:54] I will seek
[1:39:56] to honor
[1:39:59] his [singing and music] command.
[1:40:02] I pledge
[1:40:04] alce [singing]
[1:40:07] to
[1:40:10] the lamb to the lamb of God.
[1:40:14] To the [singing] lamb of God
[1:40:18] who bore my pain, [music and singing]
[1:40:22] who took my place,
[1:40:26] who wore my shame. [singing]
[1:40:30] I will seek
[1:40:32] to honor
[1:40:35] his commands.
[1:40:38] I pledge [music]
[1:40:40] alce
[1:40:42] to
[1:40:46] the lamb. Just our voices now on the
[1:40:48] chorus.
[1:40:50] I pledge
[1:40:52] alce
[1:40:54] to
[1:40:56] the lamb.
[1:40:58] With all [singing]
[1:41:00] my strength,
[1:41:02] with all [chant] I am, I will seek
[1:41:09] to honor
[1:41:12] his
[1:41:13] commands.
[1:41:15] I pledge [singing]
[1:41:17] alce
[1:41:20] to
[1:41:24] the one more time all our voices
[1:41:27] I pledge
[1:41:30] alce
[1:41:32] to
[1:41:34] the lamb
[1:41:36] with all [singing] my strength
[1:41:40] with all I am [singing]
[1:41:44] I will seek
[1:41:47] to honor
[1:41:49] his command.
[1:41:53] I pledge
[1:41:55] alce [singing]
[1:41:58] to
[1:42:01] the lamb.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Boy, that felt good.
[1:42:08] Oh
[1:42:10] Lord, thank you. Oh boy, I want to do
[1:42:15] that every day. Lord, I pledge
[1:42:16] allegiance
[1:42:18] to you. I give my life to you.
[1:42:22] Tonight, we'll have um
[1:42:26] we will I'll probably answer a couple
[1:42:28] questions. One of the questions that uh
[1:42:30] has come in fairly often is about tithe,
[1:42:32] tithing, and offerings. I will um give a
[1:42:36] shorter answer on that and maybe a
[1:42:38] couple other ones. And uh if the Lord's
[1:42:40] willing, we'll have a shorter service
[1:42:42] tonight, maybe a little longer worship
[1:42:44] service and a little longer time for
[1:42:48] prayer. So, hope to see you tonight
[1:42:51] 5:00. Brothers and sisters, I love you
[1:42:53] very much.
[1:42:56] Jesus wanted a church
[1:43:00] that people would walk into
[1:43:04] and that they would give their hearts to
[1:43:07] him.
[1:43:09] Not necessarily because of their love
[1:43:11] for the Lord,
[1:43:13] but Jesus said because of their love for
[1:43:15] each other.
[1:43:17] And that's how
[1:43:19] that Jesus prayed
[1:43:21] John chapter 17
[1:43:24] that people would accept him
[1:43:27] as the Messiah because they see a church
[1:43:29] that loves each other so much. Friends,
[1:43:32] I think we have it.
[1:43:34] I want to continue.
[1:43:37] Love one another. Pray for one another.
[1:43:39] Help one another.
[1:43:43] God bless you. You're dismissed.
[1:43:48] Glory.
[1:43:50] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:43:57] Glory.
[1:43:59] [singing] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Glory,
[1:44:08] glory, hallelujah.
[1:44:14] His truth is marching
[1:44:18] on.
[1:44:22] Oh, glory,
[1:44:24] glory, hallelujah.
[1:44:30] Glory,
[1:44:32] glory, [singing]
[1:44:34] hallelujah.
[1:44:39] Glory,
[1:44:41] glory, hallelujah. [singing]
[1:44:46] His truth [music]
[1:44:48] is [singing] marching
[1:44:51] on. Mine eyes,
[1:44:54] mine eyes have seen [music] the glory of
[1:44:58] the coming of the Lord.
[1:45:02] He is trampling out the vintage where
[1:45:06] the grapes of wrath are storm. He has
[1:45:10] loosed the faithful lightning [music]
[1:45:14] of his terrible [singing]
[1:45:16] swift sword. His truth is marching
[1:45:22] [music] on.
[1:45:26] Glory,
[1:45:28] glory, hallelujah.
[1:45:32] [singing]
[1:45:33] Glory,
[1:45:35] glory, hallelujah.
[1:45:41] Glory,
[1:45:43] glory, hallelujah.
[1:45:48] His [singing] truth is marching [music]
[1:45:52] on in the beauty of the liies.
[1:45:56] In the beauty of the liies, Christ was
[1:46:00] born across [music] the sea with the
[1:46:04] glory [singing]
[1:46:05] in his bosom that transfigures you and
[1:46:09] [music] me.
[1:46:11] As he died to make men holy, let us live
[1:46:16] [singing] to make [music] men free.
[1:46:19] While God is marching
[1:46:23] on. [singing]
[1:46:27] Glory,
[1:46:29] glory, hallelujah.
[1:46:33] [singing]
[1:46:35] Glory,
[1:46:37] glory, hallelujah.
[1:46:43] Glory,
[1:46:45] glory, hallelujah. [singing]
[1:46:50] His truth is marching
[1:46:54] on.
[1:46:58] Glory,
[1:47:00] glory, hallelujah.
[1:47:05] [singing]
[1:47:06] Glory,
[1:47:08] glory, hallelujah.
[1:47:14] Oh, glory,
[1:47:16] glory, hallelujah. [singing]
[1:47:20] Oh, yeah. His truth is [singing]
[1:47:24] marching.
[1:47:26] One more time. Glory, [music]
[1:47:27] hallelujah.
[1:47:29] Oh glory, [singing]
[1:47:32] glory, hallelujah.
[1:47:37] Oh glory, [singing]
[1:47:39] glory, hallelujah.
[1:47:46] Glory,
[1:47:47] [music] glory, hallelujah.
[1:47:52] His truth is marching
[1:47:57] [singing] on.
[1:48:00] His truth is marching
[1:48:05] on. [singing]
[1:48:08] His truth is marching [singing]
[1:48:13] on.
[1:48:14] His
[1:48:17] truth [music]
[1:48:18] is marching
[1:48:21] on.
[1:48:26] Give the glory.
