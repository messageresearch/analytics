through the scriptures this morning about all the signs of your your soon coming Lord I so want to be here so want to be alive at the day of the return of Jesus Christ Lord if there' be any hindrance caused by me or anyone that would hear this prayer I pray that we could be right Lord not hinder that second coming of Christ be with us father we pray bless our worship father may it be a blessing to you in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated I want to instead of remaining remaining standing I'm going to read a little bit longer scripture this evening and I um I want to read the whole Parable that we went through this morning and then after I read this Parable I mentioned that it's um there's a beautiful story that brother brandom tells about uh this young lady who's an orphan and how she finds the love of her life and it's just a very very sweet story and I thought it goes really good with this Matthew chapter 12 this parable of the 10 virgins um but first brother Stephen good to see you Stephen Miller here Joe Miller's son God bless you it's good to have you in service sister Margie of course bless you good to see you and I didn't recognize him this morning I forgot my friend Brother Sam baggot it's good to good to see you again so joury with us here a little bit longer want to keep you as long as we can Brother Sam God God bless you let's turn to Matthew chapter 25 and I'll read the parable we read this morning and then uh we'll play that quote uh that story from brother Brandon Matthew chapter 25 verse1 it says this then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened under 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise G give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh we don't know when our lord Jesus will return the Lord talked a lot during his ministry about his second coming and the promises that are associated with his second coming and it'll be a a great day for those that have given their heart to the Lord and and have accepted him as a personal savior remember I said this morning not as joining a church not as joining a denomination or a group of people but as a one onone relationship between the bridegroom and the bride there's a one-on-one relationship between Stephanie and me and I love her and and I I love our fellowship together and I love to talk with her we are just we're one we are perfectly one as the Bible says and that is how the bride will be with the B bridegroom we've been asked for marriage and the question is do we accept the invitation from this bridegroom to be married for all of eternity to the Lord Jesus or do we reject him and that's the question that's the question that's presented to the world brother brandom tells this story I think that you enjoy it it's 10 minutes long and he tells this story about this Rich cattle rancher and he was about time for him to get married so he goes out looking and he goes down to the ranch and and there's the these these sisters and they're all getting prettied up and doled up and they're going to marry this Cattle Baron and he just didn't see much in these girls but he saw something very very special in this barefooted little poor little girl that had a whole lot of character and many times I think that's this bride of Christ we may not have a lot of money we may not be rich we may be orphaned we may not have what the world would call importance or wealth but our bridegroom loves us our Jesus loves us let's go forward with that quote as I said it's um about 10 minutes and I believe it is revelation look it up here Revelation chapter 4 and preached on December 31st 1960 and we'll start with paragraph 6 63 God bless you the bride has made herself ready reminds me of a little story I just must say it before we go on out west here sometime ago many years there was a this great armor and Swift Packing Company how they do they come out there and buy cattle and buy ranches and they're worth a lot of money and buy up all the small ranchers and have millions of Acres of ranch like that run these big fine Herford cattle and in sections R own their own railroads and things that bring them cattle from one pasture to another armor and Swifts had a big Ranch and one day they had a foreman there the superintendent it was of the ranch he had about four or five daughters and they found out that one of the big Aral Brothers was uh or not Brothers but Sons were going to visit the ranch and he was a a young single man and all these girls sure was going to Vamp this boy as soon as he he come and so they all was getting ready and making everything ready to come when he got there this going to meet him and put on an old Frontier day with their little dresses on with the Fringe on it and 44s on each chip and them uh hats on the back of their head you know there's going to be regular westerners and each one of the girls was going to get one of them was going to get this boy and they had a a little cousin there that her mother was dead her father was dead she was a cousin and she almost was the slave to all that was there all the dirty work she had to do it washing the dishes and everything and she had no clothes she had to take handy downs and so when the time come that the boy was to arrive they all got in their Buck boards and way down to the station they went to receive him and they were shooting the guns and the horses nickering and everything they brought him out to the ranch and that night they had a big Shin dig and they got out there on the H stacks and the crow fence and they they sang and they danced and all through the night he was there for two or three days this little cousin now I'm going to liken this to something now our cousins that's all dressed up big spires and fine churches and looks like there's any dirty name that has to be given to the Pentecostal something is wrong they do the wrong thing too but they they heard about you see they're kind of classical so they you don't hear about that but let some Pentecostal Minister make a mistake one time brother I'm telling you they all Packer across the country newspaper yes sir let some Pentecostal brother pray for a child and it dies every newspaper in a country will pack uh Divine Healing is fanaticism well then how not put every case in the paper that the doctor loses sauce for the goose is sauce for the ganders so if uh they do that you wouldn't have enough room in the columns and the papers to write all the de if I go out here in the graveyard and say everybody that ever died under Divine Healing stand up then say everybody ever died under medical treatment stand up that without number a million to one that's exactly right so if they going to criticize one criticize the other that's right but they kill millions of a year with medicines and operations you never hear a word about it so this little girl she had all the rough work to do so when all at once the boy one night when supper was over and they had d and each one of these girls is pretty all up you know and this poor little girl had to have a little ragged dress on and one night she sitting in the mess hall after supper was over and she washed the dishes and she R out through the backyard to throw the dishwater out she when she turned around the cray fence there he stood leaning at the CR fence he said hello she was so ashamed because that was the superintendent's boy the son of the owner of the ring she help the dish down pan down so he wouldn't notice her s raged started backing off with the bare feet looking back like this and he walked up here said don't be afraid of me I want to tell you something he said I come out year for one purpose I come out to find a wife and said I've been looking everywhere said I didn't want to marry any of the girls back there in the city I want to get what I thought was a real wife instead of all that I've seen I've been noticing you around here and I found out through some of the hands that you're a cousin said that's right sir but I want to ask you something will you marry me why she didn't know what to do she was so beset she didn't she didn't know how to answer the man oh I just about imagine how she felt don't you when me a sinner once no good for nothing drunkard's Child Jesus Christ said I want you for mine how could he ever come to somebody like me how could he ever say I'll give you a home in heaven how could he ever say I'll save you such a wretch as me how could it ever be but he did it she said sir I'm not I'm not worthy I couldn't make a wife to a man like you said because you are used to great things and I know nothing about them I'm poor he said but you are my sh and wasn't it nice when Jesus told you that you know you wasn't worthy to be a Christian you it wasn't nothing you could ever do but it's nothing he just chose you it was his goodness his Mercy that he chose you you didn't choose him you know he chose you that's right she said said I don't she said don't look at your clothes I don't look at your clothes I look at what you are he said would you marry me and finally the agreement was made he said one year from this day I will return you be ready have the wedding garment on for I will return and marry you right here on these grounds I'll take you to Chicago to Outer Drive there where you'll have a castle to live in all this dishwashing will be over and things down when the sisters of the cousins heard about that they said you poor little ignorant fool why you know that man didn't mean that and isn't that just exactly what they say today how could a bunch of Holy Rollers a bunch of people who hardly can write their own name how would they ever be the church how would a group like that ever be but that's just all right when we got engaged and felt that bet kiss of Jesus Christ on our heart to take away our sins something tells us that he's coming back again thank someday he'll come back all years she worked slaving saving her little 75 cents they give her for her wages a day and she was saving up her money to buy her wedding gown to make everything ready oh that was all of her thought making ready and he had has she has made herself ready she got her clothes her wedding clothes while her cousins laughed at her and made fun of her finally come to the finally the days she dressed herself in her wedding Garden got all ready and cleaned up and her little cousins come around and Bow by her and said you silly little thing why you know he didn't mean that he wouldn't speak to a a mar a girl like you but she made herself ready anyhow so come along late in the evening and they begin to Mock and make fun of her she stood right at the door waiting anyhow and so she he said what time did he say it be here he said he didn't say but said she told he told me the night that he Mar he gave me the engagement ring he said he told me it would be about one year from now therefore I've got an hour left amen just kept waiting I got one hour left 30 minutes left 10 minutes left and they laughed and made fun of her and called her everything but finally right at that crucial hour they heard the sand turning under the wheels they horses are coming what a thing it was to see that little bride and made herself ready jump out of the door and round through the roast covered TRS out there to fly into the arms of the man that she loved is to be her husband to pick her up in like that and be married and ride away and he knew what it was to be poor we listen to his tapes and he he tells a story of his life story and that I I met a um a man old man named Don Weber Don Weber believe it was his mother or his grandmother that brother Bram tells the story about he couldn't make ends meet in his church they didn't have very many people back then he probably had I can't even guess how many people had but I'd say between 20 and 50 people and he could make in meet and he said that he was going to go up and he was going to take an offering now usually they pass the plate and uh it wouldn't be brother brandom that would do it it would be the um the Deacon or or the song leader whatever it was but he decided he was going to take an offering and he was going to go up and he was going to announce it and he goes up there and he says now we're going to take an offering and we're short on money and we're going to we going to pass the plate we need this much money and he looked down in the front row and there was a little lady her name was Sister Weber and she opened up her purse and brother brandom saw that little lady open her purse and he said no I was just kidding he said we're not We're not gonna we're not going to take an offering so brother somebody gave brother brandom a bicycle uh either right before that or right after that brother brandom cleaned it up painted it and sold it and paid the bills for the church so he he didn't have to ask the church for money I I was talking with this Don Weber and he introduced me to his sister and both of them knew brother brandom dawn was there when they um he was a little kid when they laid the foundation the Cornerstone for the random Tabernacle and his sister told me she said you know those brandom she said they were rough they were uh she said they were drinkers he heard brother brandom in this quote he said he said I'm the son of a drunkard he really was and uh this this Mrs Weber told me she said they were she said they uh she lived across the street from a couple of Brams a couple brother brandom's brothers they were she said they were always drunk and she says so I don't have a lot of respect for that brandom family and I said I said 'yes ma'am I I knew I knew that and she said but let me tell you she said I went to school with the Broms and she said this is during the Depression she said everybody was poor she said but those Broms they were the poorest of all of us they were the poorest of the poor so when brother brandom tells a story like that that he was there he experienced poverty he experienced hard times and you know I think it I really believe it built his character I don't think it hurt him one bit I think that is why so many people loved him is because he related to the common person it wasn't he didn't hang around all the the big preachers and all the important people and the politicians he could have brother Brandon was pretty the pretty much the biggest name in um biggest evangelist in the whole world in the 1950s he was big but he didn't want to hang around the important people he wanted to hang around people like my grandpa who was nothing more than a service station owner poor man that would save up all his money during the week and drive from tiffon Georgia to Jeffersonville to go to the meetings they didn't have YouTube back then they didn't have what we have and uh then he do it again for years and years so when brother brandom was telling the story you can tell it meant something to him because he related to that young lady and this Parable that we heard of this bride this this virgin it it's perfect with this story even as I was researching over the past couple days even the Hebrew weddings they're not like our weddings a tral an engagement was a marriage basically and then from what I read it was about a year's time from the betrothal that's when brother L you can probably correct me but I think that's about the betral is when they paid the dowy and that's when the the family of the the groom paid the family of the Bride a certain amount of money and they uh then there was a a time there where they were married but they weren't legally married to live together as husband and wife and then the bridegroom after that period of Engagement which I think it was a year then that bridegroom would come and there was a lot of Pomp and a lot of excitement and uh and a lot of as we heard as we read in the in the um Parable there's lamps and and and these just a lot of lights and a lot of just a really neat thing and the bridegroom would come and take his bride and take his bride home this story I don't know if brother brandham ever knew that when he told when he told the story but it is really really perfect with that parable of Matthew chapter 25 brother Daniel who's first and Sarah brother Aon Sister Sarah if you could you could make ready to sing I um I do this as they're coming up um this Don Don Weber it was really it's neat getting to know him he had so many stories of just the old times and and the depression and um I think I videoed him I think it's on voice of God Recordings we site if I remember right under the video section if you want to see him but just a wonderful person he was good friends with Billy Paul brandham and you know they were you know kind of grew up together and just to see the firsthand um testimony of all these things that had happened building the random Tabernacle he said that that he was there when they they brought the trusses down from the quadrangle which is just a few blocks up on on wagons and he said that they they came across both sides of the road and they they brought them down and and then brought the the trusses and set them up on the on the blocks on the masonry and he's the one he told me about um um Mr Ingram who was a wealthy businessman that he is the one that funded the brandom Tabernacle and getting it started and loaning brother brandom the money and um I believe it was in 1933 and then of course they finished it just shortly after that I could go on and on tell them those those stories God bless you brother and sister sir this morning brother Daniel ministering and he talked that about having the oil and make sure it was full it reminded me of something we happened as as a young group of PE of boys young men we went hunting out the Sita mountains and we were out there from Thursday to Saturday come Saturday at the end of the hunt we all got back to the vehicles and the camp tents and we all began to ask each other if we had water and everybody had run out of water there was no water in the camp there was no water in our canteens there was no bottle of water anywhere we were only 45 minutes away from the from where we could get water but it was a desperate feeling so the next time we went camping we had enough water to put out a forest fire you just make sure and I thought just reminded me be sure your lamp is burning so this song I asked Sarah if we could sing it together what will it be when we get over [Music] Yonder oh a country where no Twilight Shadows deepen unending days where night will never be a city where no storms will ever gather oh
