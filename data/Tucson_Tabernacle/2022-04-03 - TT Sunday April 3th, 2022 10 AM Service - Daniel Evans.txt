the one i praise [Music] amen what a promise we have from god he's uh he watches over us he keeps us brother peter if you would put that scripture back up the scripture that was up before for god hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind i read that this morning i said oh this just to be reminded of that in a day in a time when so much is happening and satan works through fear fear binds you it it has so many um reactions to it things that happen because of fear and as our brother joe spoke he said not even cancer and he said brother brown says if you don't fear it because fear allows other spirits to come in with it and it's just amazing that god's word has an answer for every situation if we can believe it and then the other scripture brother peter first peter chapter 1. i didn't give him this one but first peter chapter 1 verses 3 to 7 if we to get that up blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead what a promise to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you it's got your name on it it's yours who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice and then peter says is though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations and all of us would raise our hands and say we've had our days like that and we might have it or months like that at times but there's a promise of god there [Music] and it says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ sometimes you've got to read the last verse and i'll get stuck on the verse of one or two see what god has said so we thank the lord a bit he is mindful of us and merciful to us we have some requests to remember and brother tony ramirez had called me yesterday and this morning he sent a text him and sister maria had gone out to take sister maria at a doctor's appointment and as they stepped out he didn't notice the cement tire guard there and he tripped over it and he felt flat on his side on his ribs and he said he just couldn't get up and of course sister maria couldn't pick him up but right about then he said two healthy young men came walking by and they were able to stand him up so he would say well but he fell but god still met his need and he sent a text this morning that it was quite sore whether he damaged him or bruised him so we would remember him in prayer and then also continue to remember sister lydia mcfadden's mother and the family at this time in prayer and then our sister victoria goxiala told me that her nephew was sent to the hospital and he had had possibly a heart attack so we'll keep him and remember and then i asked sister rachel how brother al peterson was doing he says his vital signs are good but he has very little strength very little energy so i think often of brother l what a blessing brother l has been and encouragement and for me a mentor allowed me to stand back there with him way back in the beginning and learn watch him how he treated people how he acted in certain situations and watch the godly man work and it's been a blessing and i remember that so we'll keep him in prayer brother toby if you would come up and you'll stand just three times my heart said call brother toby so trying to learn to listen and there's a reason to why god knows you have a need you would raise your hand lord i've raised it a hundred times but you're still the same yesterday today and forever if we could just all bow our heads grace is heavenly father lord lord we love you god we gather here this morning god father a needy people lord god so many needs in the in your children today lord and father we lift them all to you god god lord not that not that we are worthy in and of ourselves god of the many blessings father that you give us lord nor are we worthy in our flesh god to ask anything of your throne but lord through your blood god through your blood lord father it is our inheritance father healing is the children's bread and god we pray lord heavenly father lord visit our visit your children god according to your will lord god lord those that are discouraged encourage them god those that need healing in their body heal them lord god loves the need to be restored lord restore them heavenly father we just love you lord and god we don't ask these things although our hearts break for our friends and our brothers and our sisters we don't ask them lord just for the easing of of the flesh lord but we ask them god that we would be able father to live god how you called us to lord to be written epistles living in red of all men the lord when you touch our lives other people see it and you're glorified through it god heavenly father we love you lord we invite you into our midst lord please help us lay aside all things that would so easily beset us father and lord please lord help the minister get out of the way lord may the church poll father and lord may your will your perfect will be realized through the service we ask this in your name the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen oh heal me sing it in faith saying i know that's what you're [Music] save me and i will be saved heal me and i will be the one i pray [Music] before you're seated turn around and greet those around you say good to see you this morning good to be in the house of the lord together amen god bless you amen [Music] amen you may be seated when you're done greeting amen god bless you all good to be in the house of the lord today where the lord said where two or three are gathered i'll be in a minute so we do have some praises brother jerry let me baggage it says thank the lord jesus for he healing touch at my seat sunday night i walked walking work through the storm i walked worked through the storm while we walked together this week yet my eyes are no longer weary and that headache has all but stopped i it's all stubborn i will always ask for miracle yet he knows what's best you know he's watching over you constantly sometimes you're driving down the road and you don't even next thing you know you went through something and you said that had to be god it was come down the freeway yesterday and we're all doing the speed limb about 75 miles an hour and a motorcycle goes right more on the inside and suddenly he pulls off to the inside of the freeway so we all slow down and then he just goes straight across in front of everybody but god kept us all stopped slow enough or else it would have been a serious accident in front and it just reminds you lord i'm glad you're watching over me so i have no control in reality you don't really have control of your own self you have to commit it to god so appreciate that so as we know have you heard of sister joyce dougal in her graduation returning back to who she was in the beginning and we kind of laugh about it even brother ed said something but my daughter elizabeth had wanted to give her some cookies and she said lord please don't take her yet i haven't got her the cookies yet but she got she got to go home and and brother ed could share this better but his prayer had been don't let mama suffer and um as she laid there in bed and brother keith holding her hand she took a breath closed her eyes and went home the death of a child of god is precious in his sight and he's our comfort so elizabeth sent a text he goes oh sister bed he was waiting for sister joyce best of friends i said that to brother ed and he goes no brother aaron peter turned around he said we're barely getting over sister betty being here and now we got to deal with sister joyce too i can imagine when the saints of god cross over and they're rejoicing and the wonderful time that it'll be but now we have another one to to look forward to to being with and and just the testimony of our sister is wonderful so [Music] this is uh from the dougals the burial will be family only on april 15th and the celebration of life here at the tabernacle saturday april the 16th from 11 to 3 pm lord willing here at the tabernacle so as we get further confirmation but one of god's children has gone home and it won't be long we'll be going home too so amen and at times you get to wondering why why but let's stand i bless your name i bless your name because he knows the reason why i bless your name i bless your name give you honor i give you praise [Music] the truth away your name i bless the midnight hours if you should find you're in a present in your mind reach out and praise defy those chains and they will fall in jesus name i bless your name [Music] i bless your name i give you honor i give you praise [Music] the truth [Music] god bless you all let's let's pray almighty god it feels good to be in the house of the lord this morning father that know that though we may not see you lord and know that that father our normal senses may not sense you here but you're here lord by your promise we pray father that you be welcome that you be welcome in each soul and each mind and father that you bless this service father may it be glorifying to you and encouraging to the people i pray in jesus name amen god bless you all you can be seated it feels it feels good it feels really good to be in the house of the lord this morning i think i think especially good it always feels good to be here but it feels especially good i think it started with the song choices from my brother matthew i appreciated that i know brother aaron i heard him in the back in in the other room back there but aaron was just rejoicing and he was he was singing along with it and and i just i just appreciated it so much and appreciate being here and i don't see uh brother i don't think i know you in the back there it's good to have you and the very black god bless you it's good to see it's always good to have people joining us and and worshiping with us brother daniel my friend it's good to see you over there too um we uh i was especially blessed you know with the song choices and then and then brother aaron put up first peter chapter three verses three through seven and and this morning as i was going over in my notes i had those scriptures in my notes and i took them out because i figured this was getting too long but it looks like god wanted those red this morning so i do appreciate that i appreciate the holy spirit leading brother aaron and and the things that he does and he's such a kind person he um his patience you know and uh sometimes if you have a personality like mine you're always pushing pushing and pushing and and trying to get things done and and sometimes when you have my personality you push and you push right up to that line sometimes you go over that line a little bit you don't mean to but but you do and i was been struggling this week with with some just some things i felt like i didn't do a good job on wednesday night i felt like it it didn't please the lord in the way that i presented it but i don't think i said anything wrong but i just uh i felt like the lord wasn't pleased with me and and my and my experience and and um but he knows he knows that i tried and he gave me a he gave me a special treat the other day and and i was really i was worried about it and you know my i unload and my wife and she's she always takes care of me and you know i thank god for a good help mate so so many of us we're so blessed by we put the pressures on our spouse and and they carry it for us and um but i think god if he could have given us something better than a spouse he would have done it he gave us eternal life but he gave us to help me to go through this life together as i was as i was praying about things and and repenting to the lord um i think it was on friday morning i was just sad down on myself and i read this scripture in psalm 30. brother i'm sorry i didn't give you this but it's okay if you don't put it up at uh psalm 30 verse five he's the psalmist david says this he says he's talking about the lord he says for his anger endureth but for a moment what a blessing that we can we can displease the lord and all of us do but his anger endureth just just for a moment in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning how encouraging you think about david and and all the mistakes that david made and you can think maybe david was he was repenting of something that he did he did some some hard things you know he caused a man to be murdered he committed adultery and he did and you can see how david could go before the lord and say lord i'm sorry and then that peace of the lord would come down upon him what a blessing and i i was a little tell a little story on me i don't see jordan here so this is this is good i'm gonna i'm gonna say something about brother jordan he um after service on wednesday night um i was going through on wednesday night i was going to first timothy chapter 3 and the qualifications of a pastor and i was going through each one and brother jordan after service he says brother daniel he says you left out something you just read right over it you skipped it and i said i did i said what was that he said patience and he was right i just i just went right i was like well that's fitting it's there and it's a weakness that i have i think that's why we love each other so much by the end his brother aaron has the patience of job and he's like slow down brother dan slow down come on let's move so thank god you know i think i thank god that he's made us all different and all of us come together perfectly to serve the lord and to and to make one united body i'm so i'm so grateful i'm so grateful for that i um i read i read a story the other day and uh it was a study that uh was done by harvard university in the 1950s a long time ago and uh it was a story um it was it was an experiment that they did on uh on rats and and they had they had um domesticated rats and they had wild rats and they and the kind of the purpose of the experiment was to see the difference in fortitude between these domesticated rats and these wild rats and and kids don't do this don't repeat this this uh this experiment at home with your pet gerbil or something because i'm not responsible for what might happen but what they did what these scientists did was it was a man named richter i believe his name was dr kurt richter from harvard university and he took a a sample set of these rats domesticated rats and white and wild rats and he put each of them in a bucket of water and he let him swim around for a little while and with all the rats he did i don't know how many was in his experiment how his sample set was but they all would swim for about 15 minutes and then they would drown and he didn't see a difference between the domesticated rats and the wild rats they all kind of croaked at the same time they all they all gave up and died so then he went on to do the next part of his experiment and he took the same amount of rats the domesticated rats and the wild rats and he put each one of them in a bucket of water and he let them swim and they started about 15 minutes they started to drown and he grabbed him out of the water and he took them and he put them in a place let them dry off a little bit let them dry out and he did that with this whole set of rats and after a while after they had a chance to recover he took them and he put them back in the bucket of water to see how long they would swim this time again there was no difference between the domesticated and the wild rats the first set died at 15 minutes took him out the second said he took them out put them back in for the lyle the second time they swam for 60 hours big difference they had been in there they started to sink at 15 minutes the scientists took them out set them aside let them dry out a little bit then put them back in what was the difference for the while what was the difference between the second time and the first time amen brother say it louder amen the second time even in in this little rat the second time they had hope the first time they had no hope and it just blessed me so much reading that and i read it a couple times i said you know surely this is this can't be 60 hours versus 15 minutes but it was and as as we all do we look at things we look at things with the spiritual way and we see that even these little animals that once they had hope they were just going to swim with that hope that there was going to be a hand come down and pluck them out and save them amen in uh in second kings we we know the story of uh of the special lady and we all know the story we call her the shunammite woman the shunamat woman she she and her husband built this this room on top of their house for this prophet named elisha she saw something special in this man elijah he saw something special in this prophet she knew that that he was special so they built this room up there and just were kind to him where after a while elisha he didn't maybe didn't feel that he was worthy of all these blessings and all this work that this family did for him and he and he asked his servant he says what does she need what can i do for her can i talk to the king for he's an important man can i do something for her and his servant gehazi said well she doesn't have a child she's childless and he says he says okay he said tell her this and he prophesied he said you're gonna have a child so she had this baby and the baby you know she loved him like any mother does and the baby grew up and he was working out in the field with his dad and and we know the story he said my head my head and he probably got overheated out of sun stroke she brought him back and she laid the boy on the bed of the prophet he was gone so then she saddled the donkey and she went to find this man of god and she found him and he saw her out out in the in the distance coming and he says hey there's something wrong here she's she's coming and she doesn't do this type of thing and jesus said i i don't know so she got to him and she fell down and she said my son's died the son that you prayed that i would have he's he's dead so elisha did a very strange thing he takes his staff and he gives it to his servant he says go lay the staff on this child and he says i'll be there in a little bit and there i believe it's the first time that we see the prayer cloth the the the um taking some sort of a a garment or something from a man of god and putting it on someone else i believe that's the first time in the bible that we see it so and elisha knew he knew that everything that he touched was blessed how much should the bride how much can we say the same thing that everything that we touch is blessed we're in tune with the spirit we're in tune with god so much confidence that everything that we would touch would be blessed i want to get to that place i don't feel and i'm even close to that place yet but i want to get to get to that place i have the hope that maybe those rats had swimming around that one day i'll get there so elisha came and he came to the house and he went up and he saw the dead baby laying on the bed and he knew elisha had experience he had been plucked out before he had seen the power of god before he had been a protege of another prophet named elijah and elijah elisha was following him and elise elijah knew that he was going to go up with the lord he took off his coat he came to this river he took off his coat and he smote the river and the river jordan opened up on both sides and then elijah and elisha walked through on dry ground and elisha was standing there and he saw this chariot of fire come down and it picked up this man of god and elijah threw his mantle his coat down to elijah elisha took that coat and he came to this jordan river and he smacked it he says where is the god of elijah and the waters parted elisha knew he had an experience he knew that god was on the throne he knew what god could do so he came to this baby and this baby was laying there and he laid his hands upon his hands his mouth upon his mouth he laid upon this baby and he prayed and the baby started to get warm and then he got up and he walked around and he walked around and he paced around the room and and and and you know there was a there's probably anxiety there and he was he was going he says well the baby's not he's not up yet but he still had the hope he still knew that god was on the throne he paced and he laid down on the baby again his mouth upon his mouth his hands upon his hands and we know the story the baby sneezed seven times and came back and he gave the baby back to his mother elijah knew elisha knew he had been there before he had been he had been taught well in in john chapter eight there's a story you don't have to you don't have to turn there there's a story about a woman that was caught in the very act of adultery the very act she was in adultery with another woman's husband and she was she was with that man and caught in that act it uh it says that she was she was out at the mount of olives which is outside the city of jerusalem it was a place they can't stone the people inside the city so they brought her out to be stoned and she was and she was there and she was looking at all the people there and all was lost she was going to die they had the stones in their hands and she looked at these stones and all was lost she was sinking in the water all was lost but then there came someone and he was there someone that she never knew she didn't know who this man was and the uh these pharisees these men that were going to kill this women this woman they knew this jesus man had a soft spot in his heart for people they knew that he would have trouble following moses's law here what they thought so they said we're going to catch him but aaron we know this guy we know that he loves the people so they're going to catch him so they ask him they say jesus they said she was caught in adultery and here are all these men with these stones in their hands they said this they said what would you do you know what jesus did he knelt down he ignored him he starts drawing in the sand and you can imagine this sister sitting there all of a sudden she had hope there was something hopeful going on right now and she's he's drawing and he says this he says he stands up and he says let he that is without sin let him cast the first stone and they're standing there and then he turns back around and kneels back down starts drawing in the sand and you see the wisdom over there and you see how age is important here from the oldest first these pharisees they dropped the rock they walked away from the oldest all the way to the last one there he was the youngest he dropped his and he left can you imagine how this lady felt could you imagine the hope that she felt she was about to die she was guilty of death she deserved it but she's standing there and and uh jesus he uh says where are your accusers and she says they're gone and he says this he says sister he says neither do i accuse you he says and then he says go and sin no more what a story if you look at the old testament law she had to die but then grace steps in and i just think about that lady i think that she never once that hope was placed she was pulled out of that water she could swim forever and i would i one day i want to talk to her and say now what happened after that you know she was an encouragement she said he did it for me he can do it for you i was just i think of uh let me go to let me uh let me go to scripture here romans chapter 8. well let me finish before before i get to romans chapter 8 jesus when she left he said go and sin no more he makes this statement then spake jesus again unto them and he says i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life amen and then and then you look and and that lady she could testify that i was about to go yes he's got the life he's got the light romans chapter 8 verse 24 for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for why would paul say that i mean it actually it makes it makes sense when when you read it it but it's but it's a it's a strange statement that he would would say but it it just makes sense it's like if you hope for it and you already have it why are you hoping for it we have the hope friends of something like those and i don't want to compare us and i feel i don't feel checked i feel it's right i don't want to compare us to these rats that are in the water but the amazing grace that saved a wretch like me i mean we can we can we can compare ourselves to those little animals that were in the water and we see that that if we have that hope we can keep swimming we can keep going we can keep pushing we can keep moving verse 25 but if we hope for that we see not then we with patience wait for it amen how beautiful likewise the spirit also help with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered i love that scripture it's probably my favorite scripture in the whole bible i absolutely love that because it's not when we are praying we have the hope we know that god can do it we've seen him do it but when we are praying there is something there is a next step that we make then it's not us praying brother jeremy it's the holy spirit that is speaking through us and then god takes that faith of jesus christ and he places in our hearts we can't do it ourselves god has to do it himself he takes it and he places it in our hearts so we don't have to worry about it it's his we know he can do it we have the hope we have we have the patience to wait for it we can keep swimming i can keep swimming until the cows come home i'm going to keep going i'm going to keep swimming because i know that he can do it and then he takes that faith he places it there and it happens amen galatians chapter 2. knowing 2 verse 16 thank you knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be saved be justified that poor sister that had sinned she was gone but christ came in and we can't friends we can't so often it's just like say it over and over and over and over and over and then it'll happen that's not how it works you know we all of us we've seen that fail so many times it's like just confess it just confess it that is good and we should do that but there is something that happens that we get into that channel and then god sends down that faith and we're healed and i've seen it happen so many times but i've also seen it happen the other way i've seen people say over and over and over i got it i got it i got it i got it but you don't have it yet you have the hope of it which is good we need the hope but you haven't got it yet it takes god so have faith in him just wait on him and friends that's why brother brown's ministry means so much to me because we saw through the through the ages we've seen people we've seen blessings come and we've we've seen them go and and it's always been on a man or a woman's heart to really touch god to really have that relationship on a real son or daughter of god it's really in us and then boy back in the late 40s and 50s a man came to this world and he had it he had the goods and he could come to the platform and he could say your name is this and this and this you're you're suffering with this this and this go and be healed and friends the the hope raised and they said somebody can do this we haven't seen this and it raised the people's hope it raised the people's faith and then as they came to the platform and he would tell them their name he would tell them what was going on in their lives and there was no way anyone could know that it could be nothing other than god telling this man this and then then they were able to grab hold of that faith that's why it means so much to me brother bran's ministry it it's it's so dear to my heart and it makes me it hurts me that people attack it the way they do i know brother branham was not infallible i know that i know brother branham was not god i know that that doesn't bother me but what bothers me is people constantly attacking and then they will take brother branham's ministry and they will see look at how he messed up here look how he made this mistake here and look at all this over here therefore he's false and get away and then the people lose the hope they lose that and it hurts the people it doesn't help anybody to do that i could go up here and i could say brother branham said this here and this here brother branham was wrong here and here and how would that help anybody i wouldn't want somebody to do that to me would you want somebody to stand in this pulpit and tell you how wrong you were tell and tell everybody else how wrong you were that's not right that doesn't do any good to anybody and with brother branham of course he made mistakes of course he was a man but let me tell you something he had something that i want he had a relationship with jesus christ that i want to have and because he came and because i have seen it i've seen it on video i listen to his tapes i hear the testimonies because he came i have the hope that i can have it too and sorry friends you can't take that away from me he holds a special place in my heart and his ministry i will stand on it and i will fight for it because it was the truth it showed us that god is alive and it increased my faith and tell the truth it introduced me to a living christ it did and that's that's my testimony i tell it all the time brother branham's ministry introduced me to a living jesus christ just as john the baptist did with with andrew and andrew and john he introduced them to christ you know what he introduced me to him too and he gave me the hope that whatever i have need of that god is able he is able to take care of it there was a there was a friend of mine in jeffersonville um the reason that i know i know so many testimonies and i like to give testimonies when when i'm when i'm speaking jesus did jesus most much of his ministry was testimonies with stories it was parables because if i if i'm reading all these scriptures brother aaron you'll forget them you know and it's we're human and if you're not writing them down and then going back to the sermon and going over things you'll forget those things but you won't forget these stories just like jesus and he's telling the good samaritan story all of us know it we don't know the details we know the details but we don't know where in the scriptures and all this it may be but it's stuck with us and that's that's why i enjoy telling these stories because i know that you're going to remember these there was a there was a friend of mine in jeffersonville he and i we would often go out and and just find old folks and and ask them if they knew a man named william branham well this friend of mine was in salem indiana and he asked this older lady he said you ever heard of a man named william brown she says yeah she says she says there was these two ladies in the hospital she said they were they were in the same room both of them were dying of cancer and two this one lady her two friends went to brother branham's meeting and they got a handkerchief and brother branham in the meeting he said take this handkerchief and take it to this lady that's in the hospital your friend and lay it on her so they did what they instructed they took and they went to the hospital room and they said oh we went to william branham's meetings and it was great and we saw these heels healings and and here's a handkerchief he said to lay it on you he said to pen it to your to your garment your undergarment and uh she was embarrassed this lady was and she didn't she didn't want to do it she she was embarrassed and she's like oh no you know i don't uh i don't really want to do that um you know i'm not it's not that's not for me so then the lady there was a curtain and then the lady in the bed next to her says um if you're not going to take that i'll take that there was hope she was dying both of them were dying and there was hope there was hope in this one lady she had hope that this man was of god that these stories that she had heard as she was listening that these were true she said if you're not going to take it i'll take it so she takes the prayer cloth she pins it to herself and then my friend talking to this lady the lady says that was my mother the other lady died and she said my mother lived because she had hope she had that and she got a hold of it and then she made she made a step we uh my mom she uh she died of breast cancer and she uh we um stephanie was there we were we had we were having home meetings because mom couldn't move mom could not get up out of the chair and walk across the room and she was the cancer was here she couldn't raise up her arm she was very very sick and we were we would we would go over to her house with dad and and the whole family would come together it was a nice time of fellowship with the family and we would listen to one of brother braham's tapes we'd sing and we'd have service there at home and one day it had been raining it seemed like for a month and it's dark outside and we uh we listened to a tape and i told the family i said okay let's let's pray let's pray for mom so i went over to mom and i laid my hands on her and i remember saying these words i remember saying satan you have no right to her back off my brother adam was standing with his hand on mom here right next to where the cancer was and the cancer pushed out of my mom and my brother felt it on it he was afraid it pushed out and it pushed into my brother and my brother kind of backed up and he told me what had happened afterwards and and as we were praying and and my wife can remember this remember when the sun just shone into the window it had been raining for for weeks it seemed like and the sun just came in the window and it was just it was such a beautiful time and and my mom was sitting in her chair and she stood up and we kept singing and then she raised her hand and then she raised both hands she hadn't been able to raise that hand she hadn't been able to walk then she raised that hand and then she said this she said it's leaving she said it's leaving and she started walking around and rejoicing and the next day my mom walked hiked four miles in charlestown state park but then it came back five years later the sickness came back and she suffered friends she suffered like i don't know if it would be possible for any human being to suffer that much i don't know why i always wondered lord why would you do that to mom and then have her suffer the way that she did remember god's ways are not our ways his thoughts are not our thoughts i think about job job he was a great he was a great man and and he was he was a godly man a good man if anybody didn't deserve persecution it was job and then sister shirley there was a meeting in heaven and the sons of god came and presented themselves before the lord and satan was with them and then you know what happened god picked a fight with satan he says this hey have you ever considered my servant job and satan was like well yeah you protect him all the time he said he said yeah you know of course of course you know he's a good man you protect him all the time and then god tells satan he says okay just don't take his life but you can take whatever else you want god picked a fight with satan and poor job is here on earth and he has no idea what's going on he has no clue what's going on but there was something going on in heaven that we didn't understand just like there's something going on now in heaven that we may not be privy to but we want to be on the right side of these things so then satan comes in and he takes job's children the worst thing that a parent could think of he takes job's children yet job stands strong so then we have another meeting sister shirley that we talked about the other day the same meeting the second time the sons of god came up satan was with him god does it again have you considered my servant job i'm proud of the guy he's my boy i'm proud of this guy this is my servant job and poor job is down here on the ash heap and he's just struggling man and god's up there saying that's my boy i'm proud of him satan see satan says well you know you're still protecting him he's still got his health he says take his health so he goes and he gives him cancer or or whatever it was skin boils and just made job miserable but he had seen he had seen the tree and he had seen it fall down and saw another he'd seen another tree grow and he knew that there was a god he had that hope and then brother aaron you quoted to me when we were praying in the in the back i mean i thought came out of my shoes i didn't tell you but but brother when brother aaron and i were praying brother and quoted the same thing that i'm going to say right now job stood strong and he said though my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i will see god he had hope he was swimming and he was like i'm not sinking and god's up there and he's like that's my boy and friends that's how we are so often you know we unders we don't understand why and and this is where i had aaron the the um the scripture that you put up in first peter you know what we don't understand why these things happen why why do they happen but there's something going on beyond our understanding that should be encourage us that we know just keep swimming just keep swimming because god is on the str on the scene and he's watching over as he knows about romans chapter 5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this great this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god amen and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulations the tribulation worketh patience we think it's strange when we go through these things but god is up there he's watching just like he was with job and he's proud of us he loves us he knows we're going to pass the test he knows we have hope he knows we're going to keep swimming he knows we're not going to sink but when we do start to sink there's a mighty hand that comes down and he'll pluck us out and we rejoice in tribulations in verse 4 and patience experience and experience hope i've had these experiences and you've all had these experiences we've seen others plucked out of the water and we've been plucked out ourselves amen and hope maketh not ashamed it doesn't put us to shame it uh it doesn't disappoint us because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us we may not understand it when we're praying we can say lord i don't understand why i'm going through these things i don't understand why my children go through these things why my brother why my sister i don't understand but i have faith i know that you have you have a handle on these things 4 and i'll just go on for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly now look back at verse 3 there if you could put verse 3 back up and not only so but we glory in tribulations knowing that tribulation worketh patience that word tribulation and suffering and then all the it's it's all over the bible it's strange that it's in there that we would have to suffer i talked about my mom there i talked about job i talked about that lady that was in the hospital they were suffering and it's that's what god's will is can you imagine if if you were counseling somebody and they were saying i'm really struggling with this you know i have i have uh i have these people at work and they're really mean to me and and you know and i'm sick and i don't know why it's like man that is so great i'm so envious of you you imagine saying that no but that's the way we should be oh you're struggling great you're right in the lord's will yes you're partaking in this i'm not recommending that we do that but that's the way we should be but it sounds strange that sounds really odd but that's how jesus taught matthew chapter 5 verse 11. jesus taught when we're struggling we're blessed these tribulations work with patients these tribulations are good for us it's hard for us when we're hurting my my aunt jacqueline right now i don't know if if you all know her she's she's struggling with cancer and she's sick and i was i was in there with her yesterday and she was just down and she was sick and and she told me she says you know she says it's so easy for people to say you know just believe just be strong but when you feel it it hurts you know when you're sick man it's hard it's hard to have that faith because you feel that sickness but rejoice is what jesus said blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you who talks like that besides the lord jesus but he had a wonderful he changed everything acts chapter 5. another example of suffering verse 40. and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded them that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer to suffer shame for his name and daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach and to preach jesus christ they literally rejoiced because they suffered amen and that's the way that god's children should be we should rejoice that we are suffering i know it it's against our dna but god can change our dna i have a i have a friend um he's uh kind of famous in message circles a few years ago his name is yusef nardakani brother youssef is a minister as a pastor in iran and he made a stand against the iranian government the iranian government was teaching islam to all the children in the school and brother yusef went to the school board and said this and said this is wrong you are forced we're christians you're forcing our children to believe this way and it's in the iranian constitution that that we are have freedom of religion so what did they do they threw yusuf in prison and then another brother brother matthias the same role as brother youssef there translating brother branham's message into farsi he felt he did the same thing with in a different way wanting to have church stood up against the government back in prison and these brothers they were in prison they were waiting they were saying i can't wait to get out to go back and preach the gospel and then i'll go right back in prison with young children with children that were five six seven years old yet it's worth it to me i'm gonna go right back into prison but i am going to preach this gospel and they counted it a blessing that they could suffer persecution brother youssef and those brothers we have it so easy here in the united states but over in different places in the world things are tough things are tough for a christian and uh you know what let me let me back up a little bit there to tell you the truth i don't know of a tougher place to be a christian than the united states of america i don't know of a harder place and it's not because so much that they throw us in prison or they kill us but it's that pressure that we feel it's that pressure that our young sisters feel that you sister's feeling you stand strong i am not going to bow to it you stand strong you keep swimming we're not going to do it we are going to stand with the convictions that we believe and you can be in work brother aaron it could be wherever we are it is persecuted it is looked down upon oh you're one of those weird people you know they say it and if they don't say it they look you up and down you know you're different you know this aaron garrett guy he's different you know he comes in and and he's doing his word he's different you know is one of those people but let me tell you something you sisters you go out the men don't they don't cuss around you they watch their tongue at least they should and i know they do it more they wash their tongue because they respect that they respect it but it is a tough place this united states to tough place to serve the lord i'm going to wrap philippians chapter 3. verse 8 yea doubtless and i count all things but a loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ i like that you know i i didn't plan on stopping there but but it's like all these things that i lost because i'm a christian you know what i think of them he said it it's not it's dumb it's garbage it's it's it's it's nothing for whom i have for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that i might win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is the law but that which is through faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings there it is again christ is suffering i'm going to go right in there with it being made comfortable being made conformitable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead that was paul's prayer he said lord let me suffer let me suffer like you suffered you've heard that you've heard the statement take up your cross and follow me take up your cross what does that mean that doesn't mean pick up a piece of wood that means take up my suffering this suffering that i had take that take that and carry that through this life jesus had people spit in his face what would we do they spit in his face for this gospel and paul's saying here he's saying i want to have someone do that to me paul is saying here he says i want to be so different from the world that i want my friends to leave me i want these people that have always been around me and been my friends growing up i want them to leave me because that's what happened to you lord jesus even your very best friends left you i want to suffer the same thing not of course to drive people away but to live that life of christ first peter chapter 4. for as much then as christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind so friends that means prepare yourselves for these persecutions that come to us every day for he that suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god you know friends i went i went into the ministry i knew full well that i was going to fail that i was going to fail multiple times i knew that and in in but it was worth it to me it was worth it to me that knowing that i'm a carnal person knowing that that i make many mistakes probably more than most but i knew i was going to fail and i was prepared for it i was prepared prepared to suffer there and i still am you know but it's worth it more to me if i could see people standing with this word standing with this bible standing with what this word says and to tell them keep swimming because this bible says that he's going to pluck you out one day this bible says that you have the hope of glory you have the hope of these things but one day that faith that rapturing faith is going to come into you and that master is going to pick you up out of that water and he's going to take you to glory that's what this word says and friends if we can point people to that brother peter as a minister of the gospel we point people to that hope it's going to happen one day and i want to be numbered with that group of people it could be any dire situation whatever it might be whatever the worst is jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest whatever the problem is and he goes on he says this matthew 11 28 brother peter come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and loyally in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light i am more than able to carry your problems just just bring them to me friends i i think about those those little animals swimming around and and i'll close if sisters if you could come to your instruments i think about those little animals and and i think about them swimming around for 15 minutes and they didn't have the hope they didn't have christianity you know i look at the world and they they don't have it and if we are true christians if we love the lord jesus and if we truly know him we want to give that hope to someone else we want others to have that hope to us keep swimming keep swimming keep going things aren't so bad these these these sufferings that you have they're prophesied to come you're just fulfilling prophecy these these bodies they get sick and they die we want to be healed of course you know i but we're going to get old and if the lord doesn't come we're all going to walk that path i think if sister douglas you know we she's talked about it probably her whole life i didn't know sister dougal very well but she was friends with stephanie's family and ever since i've known stephanie i've heard the name sister dougal all the time as somebody that always was an encouragement to us and i think that apple didn't fall far from the tree brother you know brother i just lost his lost his mom and uh i was up and i was just kind of down like i was saying and brother ed calls up to encourage me and he just lost his mom you know to encourage us to keep going and then sister dougal passes over and now it's a reality she's not swimming anymore now she's safe in the hands of the master she's there she's protected and she's the lord's got her in his hands you know she's she's in his presence right now and you know what she's now doing she's not waiting for us and one day one day we will be there let's let's stand friends [Music] thank god that we have hope brother peter if you put up the masterpiece 64 705 brother branham says this and i hope this encourages you and like i said i love this man's ministry it has been such a blessing to me it has given me hope my whole life whenever i had things go wrong when i was a kid all the way to now i can i can listen to this man preach and know that he was a real deal he says this he says on an interview a few moments ago i was speaking to a person in the room that's present now i said brother branham i've had so many things that i know that's wrong godly little woman i said but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you try to do and if you really love the lord you try to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hidden in the blood of jesus christ see he made a way amen [Music] i lost brother aaron but brother aaron if you could come and friends let's just let's let's bow our heads and and and think about the hope that we have and the blessings that we've that we've been given and what is going to come in the future and i want to encourage you to be strong and don't get caught up then we had that prayer line when brother joe was here the people were coming through and i was i was telling my brother peter about this yesterday that there was so much pressure on the people pressure from the world pressure pressure from depression and sister he delivered you from it how wonderful is he just plucked you right out but so many more people need that friends remember he is he is able and he loves us and and he's there and just keeps swimming because we have a promise that it's we're about to be plucked out let's bow our heads let's pray oh god we're so thankful for the promise lord we're so thankful that we can read your word lord and we can believe those those testimonies that are in the bible and we know that we can claim those lord for ourselves we know lord that your mighty hand is there whenever we have trouble whatever it may be that you can just pluck us right out oh god we're so grateful and we just want to give you the glory lord and tell you we love you oh god thank you lord we thank you for each other that that you've given us friends that can swim in this water together and encourage each other and point to that hope that is in your word that hope that is in jesus christ dear god we're so grateful and i'm so grateful to you father we love you and lord whatever trials that this day may have or this upcoming week i pray lord that you would be with every believer that's here and father that you'd be with everyone that is streaming in [Music] father that that you'd be with this little church may your hand be upon them oh god we thank you for that hope we thank you for christ we thank you for your promises because we know that one day we'll be plucked out lord let us just keep swimming in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you my friends stand strong but aaron i appreciate you appreciate the gifts that you have [Music] oh my god is in the lord forever [Music] is [Music] you take a little child in fact they say teach a child to swim when they're very young because the older you get the harder it is to throw yourself in take a child and we watch it when my niece got their swimming pool and my my grandchildren wanted to be in the pool so bad gave them some swimming lessons and then they terrified grandma and grandpa because they had no trouble jumping right in when you know that god is able because you've experienced him already taking you out then you're willing to go right in and you have calms as he started to give that story i said oh i know why because they had a hope also that they were going to be rescued and what a joy that gives you what strength that gives you amen thank the lord for that and when you are having a little bit bit of trouble call somebody else and just say pray for me and they'll share you the trouble they've gone through and how god has delivered them because each one of us has gone through our times you know and as much as we'd love to say everything is always perfect it isn't that way we have the family over for dinner at the house and everybody on a friday evening my daughters my grandchildren and all and i got a little upset at one of the girls and i kind of chewed on her a little bit and she went home crying [Music] and big tough daddy i was right for about 30 minutes and i had to go to the room and say i'm sorry because i wasn't right but you know how quickly you can say i'm sorry i'm wrong god is willing to step in and say it's okay i still love you son i still love your daughter and the reason you're going through what you're going through is because i love you and i want to see their character in you amen so let the storms clouds rise let them go by they don't worry me i'm sheltered safe in the arms of god let's start with the first verse [Music] they're leading me in a path i have no fear when jesus walks beside me foreign [Music] within the arms of god he walks with me and god of earth within the arms of god i shall hear the call from my child it's the last it's the last time you're gonna be in that bucket he's coming with this i'll fall asleep and waking god's new heaven shall turn within the arms of god [Music] shall [Music] brother ed would you come up [Music] i've been really encouraged with brother ed since mom got sick and went i call him to encourage him and he went the other way around he encouraged me
