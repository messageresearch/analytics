[Music] Hallelujah yes if we would just do that brothers and sisters we would Fly Like an Eagle I remember one time I was up hunting and I saw this beautiful golden eagle flying they're just huge it seems like wherever you see an eagle there's always a crow or something pecking at it and it was flying along and and and that thing that it had a crow following it and that thing was dive bombing it and that eagle just kept on flying just ignored it just ignored the the little demon that kept on after him and after him and after him and then after a while he kept on and that Crow came to dive bomb him and he turned over on his back in mid-flight and stuck out those Claws and that Crow pulled away and he flew away and Eagle turned around and started flying along they're so beautiful let's let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 sister Lily if you could keep playing for a little bit Hebrews 11 let's start with chap uh verse number 32 and I'll read through the end of it says this Hebrews chap 11:32 and says and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and of Samson and of jeepa and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised from life again to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of crew mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder they were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worth worth y they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which do easily beset us and and let us run the race let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was not that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father what faithful words you have given us thank you for this book of Hebrews and father we pray that that as this sermon progresses as this day progresses father that you would instill more of that Faith from those great Patriarchs that we read about father May that Faith be more and more in our hearts and in our souls that we may represent you better

throughout the Bible and we all love we love to worship and good music really um sets a good atmosphere for worship I uh had something on my heart I've had it on my heart about six months now I believe the Lord's he continues to bless us he's just he's just so good I've had it on my heart um Stephanie was reading a book and she was so excited about it it was called the cross and the switchblade is anybody familiar with that book it's uh it's written by a man named David Wilkerson it's it's basically his story about how he started this organization called Teen Challenge and it's done just it's been a tremendous work it's done so much for uh for so many people and it's not just for teens it's for the whole spectrum of society um by the way way brother Aaron pointed out to me this morning speaking of of our young people that they're about to go back to school if you haven't already brothers and sisters pray for our youth amen and when you go back to school young brothers and young sisters be a light wherever you are be wherever you go bring that faith of Jesus Christ with you be encouraged and then you encourage others also sister Becky I just saw you back there God bless you it's good to see you um but uh so this is been on my heart this Teen Challenge and and thinking about the tremendous testimony of this man named David Wilkerson how he was led and and I can't give the story now it's so long and just so powerful but how he was led to these in inner city Youth and the drug addicts and and all of the the abusers and the Crim ridden gangs and all that and and just how the the Lord just paved his way provided not only provided an audience for him but provided the money that he needed to go out and and do the work and it's just it's been something that's just been on my heart to have a type of a Ministry that we can help people off the streets and I think we're in a good place in this this portion of Tucson that we can really use that so I've been praying about it and and just thinking about it for for quite a few months now now really I mean it's been a couple years now ever since I started coming to this Tucson Tabernacle um so sister um sister Zyra gave me a testimony the other day um we spoke on the phone and she said that she was at this thrift store just down the road here on um stone stone and Roger around there and she was in there and she was doing some shopping for or something and she started listening to the music that was being played in the store and she heard oh this is Christian music it just made her feel good so so she she uh she had uh someone on her heart a family member that really needs to get into some sort of program so she was talking to the people there and it turns out it's a it's a Christian thrift store and she wanted she asked do you have any programs that you know of that could be for this this um family member that needs it and they said yeah and and they told her about this program that they have so I was talking with sister Zyra and she um relayed this to me and I said you know what it's on my way home I'll stop by there so I was driving by and I had a hard day at work and and I was just really struggling with some things and I always like to drive by the church just makes me feel better so I just drove by and just just to look at the building and and see what the Lord's doing it just gives me Faith brothers and sisters just makes me feel good so I drove by and and looked at the church and then I remembered oh sister zyus said to to visit this this thrift shop so I go in there and uh I walk in and there's a bunch of people at the cash register and I immediately notice that um the m Christian music I thought okay this this feels good and it's just it's pretty bear and there isn't a whole lot of stuff in there so if I forget I I recommend this place if you have any donations that you want to make of of decent furniture or anything bring it to this thrift store I think they could really use it they're doing a good work so I was I was in there and I waited till everybody left and then the guy behind the counter um I walked up and I asked him I said uh uh a a friend of mine told me that you all have a um a program for substance abusers and I said uh and not just for kids for for adults I said uh do you have something like that and he looked at me and said not me I said not for me and I said well you know I on Tabernacle I'm the pastor of that church and it's like not for me and and he says he says yeah and he gave me a flyer oh I left it in my vehicle um he gave me a flyer and it was Teen Challenge and he says 'y yeah he says if if you someone needs help he says ' we'll help them and no we won't require any payment and I said well I would like to I would like for our church to help in this so I'm talking with him and as when he mentioned Teen Challenge this kind of squirly guy he was working there he he has one eye that goes this way and one ey that goes straight and he said he says I'm six months into the program doing good it's like oh wow good and he goes by and then somebody over here he says I'm I graduated I'm past a year he says he I'm serving the lord now he says I'm doing doing good I'm off I'm off all the drugs and I I said all right and then another guy over here he says he says I'm nine months in and he says it's the best program in the in the world he says he says we're serving the lord we're doing this and what did this place does is it hires these people to help get them off the streets and give them a job to do and I was like Lord this is feeling really good do you have maybe some sort of a of a sign and just a little bit more you know you want a little bit more Gideon was like well yeah you know it's it's wet on this side and it's dry on this side but let's do it backwards just so I'm sure so that's how I was feeling and I said I said uh maybe just Lord maybe just a little bit more and and kind of the squirrly looking guy he comes he comes by and I said well I said kind of my history I said I was in um Louisville for about 17 years and I recently moved back to Tucson and the the the guy he says I was in Louisville and he said it right he said Louisville I say Louisville still the girls here from Jeffersonville they know so he said uh he says yeah I was in Louisville he says I was I was I was raised there and I said really what part of town were we on he said well I wasn't really in in Louisville he says I was I was from across a river from a little town wow I said What town he said Jeffersonville Indiana you ever hear that I said actually I'm not from Louisville either I'm from Jeffersonville I said I was there 17 years he said really he goes I'm a red devil he says he says I went to Jeff High I was like wow man thank you Lord this is this is still feeling good I said really I said I said uh you ever hear of uh brandom Tabernacle he goes oh yeah he goes brother brandom he goes Joseph Brandon voice of God Recordings he says oh yeah I was like wow wow yes so I started talking with him and he said oh he and he tells the the um the guy running the cash reg as we talked for a while and I said here's what I used to do and all that he goes he goes hey and he walks over the cash register he says uh you need to talk with this guy pointing to me he said you guys really need to talk so I got um he put me in touch with one of the directors for Teen Challenge here and uh we'll see we'll see we we don't want to get ahead of the Lord but we'll see how it moves and brother Arie maybe we might have something to direct some of these people that we witness to all the time that really need the Lord I know brother Arie has such a burden amen for the homeless people and the substance abusers so maybe we'll start moving that direction and we we'll start helping in that way it was just it it was just a a the Lord was with was with me there and I was telling this testimony and somebody tells me they said how do you have all these testimonies like wow you're you're always how do you have how does the lord always do this stuff in your life he said you know the Lord I feel like the Lord's not doing doing anything in my life he said I serve the Lord and I do all this and because I put myself in that situation exactly because I put myself where the Lord can use me I could have just drove right by the thrift store and I wouldn't have had that testimony to to give to the church but we need to put oursel in the Lord's way put oursel out so the Lord can use us and in doing that always be ready to give a witness always be ready to talk about the Lord and then he he can use you and we're about to read about these Heroes of Faith in in Hebrews chap 11 they were always available for God they always put themselves out there they they walked in God's path and they stopped at the thrift store they did itow when Matthew was there and Jesus Christ walked by he's there with changing the money he had this great career this man walked by he said I'm done with it I'm following him and if he would have stayed a tax collector we would never know his name but instead he wrote the first book in the New Testament I mean tremendous on because he got up and he did it he put himself out there so that God could use him and what I don't tell you all is the nine out of 10 times that I fail maybe 99 out of a 100 I don't tell you the story I embarrassed my wife I don't tell you the story when we were at an ice cream place in Jeffersonville and these people got out of church and these two old ladies were sitting at the table there in the in the in the ice cream area and I went down and I said so did you just get out of church the woman said yeah and I said uh what the what the preacher preach about uh I don't know it's like okay do you love the Lord um yeah okay um uh what's your favorite scripture in the Bible well and these two old old women um she said something I said I said have you given your heart to the Lord Jesus and and the old woman says you know what I believe a Christian is she said I believe a Christian is someone that would allow two women who just got out of Church to enjoy their ice cream without bothering them I don't tell you those stories but that's usually what happens we've got to put ourself out there and if you fail 99 times out of a 100 you succeeded one time and we want to succeed I got the brothers together last night and we went to visit a church literally across the street over here and I appreciate the brothers coming and and we went over there just to put out the right hand of Fellowship to this this little Spanish church and we went in there and uh it was people were so nice and there's a small group what was it maybe 30 people something like that it's all men all from young men all the way up to older men and uh they uh we we got our place and we all sat down and then the music started and it was terrible it was loud banging drums I was like oh man and I was struggling my head started hurting I couldn't understand anything that was saying because it was so loud and so turned up and the speakers were were cracking it was just it was it was just like I was like oh man I said Lord and I had to bow my head during the the the the pre-service during the worship service and say Lord I'm sorry I made a mistake for bringing these brothers over here with me I said Lord I'm sorry and and U I said I said Lord just just help us to get through and and and I made a mistake and and it continued on and then they uh you know when we clap at the end of the of the song I was clapping because it was over and then they uh they invited the the guest speaker and uh he came up and immediately I was in a bad mood I immediately didn't like him he came up and after about two minutes my thoughts completely changed brothers and sisters we always have to be careful about judging and just because that music didn't sound right right to me just because I didn't I couldn't hear the words just because it it gave me a headache and it made me nervous it doesn't mean that it's not right we're not changing our music to match that but it doesn't mean that ours is any better than theirs that's the way that they like to worship right so it's okay and when this brother started ministering he has uh he has a church in Monterey Mexico and he started his sermon with his with his testimony and I was telling sister Lily and Daniel earlier it is so important that all of us have a testimony that is what you can tell people that's what grabs their attention if you would have just opened up the Bible and started teaching it would not have been effective like this but he started with his testimony he said I was he says I started drinking at 10 years old he says my dad was an alcoholic my dad used to beat me and he said he would beat me so bad he said the only when he would finally stop is when I would wet my pants he said he beat me so bad he said I hated my dad got to be 15 years old he meets a 20-year-old girl she has a 5-year-old son this they get together she she she's um gets pregnant he's 15 he starts beating her just as he had learned and he's on drugs and he's drinking he's an alcoholic he's doing all of this stuff he's a thug you should have seen the pictures of him tattoo across his stomach I mean just someone that you would not you would be afraid to even walk into this building and there he is up there and he's got this he's got this girlfriend and the picture of him there and and they're just she's not living right she had a bad profession she was um like a a a model that you would see at a ball game and she's she's not looking good he's he's has his problems and then he he come he gets mad at her and he beats her she leaves and then she doesn't have anywhere to go she's on the streets she calls him back she calls him and she says I want to come home I don't have anywhere to go she said but I can't I can't come home and and H and have you beat me like this he made a change in his life a young man 15 years old he made a change in his life the Lord God of of hold of him wow the drugs and the alcohol let me tell you this guy was the perfect example of a loser on the streets substance abuser everything that he could have done wrong he did wrong but then God got a hold of him and he starts they have more children they have three boys and a girl the one of the boys is the adop he adopted the 5-year-old boy that his wife had and then they had one so he's only 10 years older than his oldest son and they're raising these children and he said I had to get over that with my dad and and he started quoting his dad his dad would be sitting there with a bottle in his hand and saying son never drink but he set a bad example how can you tell someone not to do something if you're doing it and yet this young man he the Lord is on his mind and he's he's he's moving forward in life and he's raising these children and he starts he gets gets a hold of the Lord he starts going to church he starts preaching the gospel and what a testimony I got to tell you I bowed my head so Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for thinking anything bad about this music forgive me and he's giving this testimony and he raises these children and he put up a picture they all had a wedding at the same time all three of his boys they all married very fine young ladies and his daughter she's she is too young to get married yet but she's she's serving the lord and he said these brothers are a witness he said my children have my boys my daughter have never drank they have never done drugs and they have never slept with someone had sex with someone before marriage prise God and the same thing for these young ladies that these boys married they met young and these girls have the same testimony as the boys that they married I looked at that I said Lord that man is a hero he is a great man he could be listed in in some of these people that I'm going to talk about today they get he has he starts this church and this church grows and grows and he starts a Ministry out to the homeless people and the substance abusers now he's helping countless people he's got five or 600 people in his church and they have this ministry through Monteray helping the substance abusers and getting them back on their feet praise the Lord for this man for what he's done that young man well he's not a young man he's 40 years old I was I was looking at him like Lord that is a hero of the Gospel right there and I was so proud to have been there what a testimony from this man Hebrews chapter 1 I mean 11:1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear God requires Faith brothers and sisters we look at the things things now and they're here and God creates them but they came from nothing but he is God so when he speaks nothing becomes something that's with us in our in our lives this man right here nothing became something when God stepped into my life the man that we heard last night nothing became something when God stepped into his life by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh you know that story Genesis the beginning of Genesis Abel was born Cain was born twins Abel gave an offering to God that pleased God it was he killed a lamb he killed an animal knowing that his that something must die for life to be produced for life to continue Cain made a flowery altar it may have been much prettier much nicer but Abel's was accepted by God and Cain's was rejected because it wasn't right it was his self-righteous way that he said Lord you're going to do it my way because this looks better to me and then the anger welled up in Cain and he killed his brother and here comes God walking and he says where is your brother Cain he says his blood is crying out to me me from the ground think of the think of the faith that Abel had so much so that that when he was killed his blood poured out on the ground and even his blood was so full of faith that it cried out to God that's Faith how wonderful that we know that when we die whether you're I know people argue should be cremated should you be buried you whatever this listen wherever you are if you're an ash blowing in the wind it's going to cry out to God and God will answer Cain's own blood I mean Abel's own blood crying out to God and God heard you remember the story of Elisha when Elisha got sick and died and they put him in the Tomb and then there was there were there was a funeral possession coming by and I believe it was the moabites the Raiders they came down and they were going to rob this funeral possession they take the body and kick throw the body in the they threw the body in the grave and they took off well that grave just happened to be Elisha's grave the prophet that dead body of that that dead man that had died fell upon the body or even the grave we don't even know if the body was in there it fell in the grave of Elisha and that faith that was in Elisha that spirit that was in Elisha was so great that that body jumped up again came back to life that's how important this faith is and when we have that faith that is in us that we are Eternal there's nothing can ever take us take life from us if our blood is spread out on the ground it will cry out to God Beautiful by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God am how many want that testimony Lord when I die when I pass from this Earth let me have the same testimony that Enoch had I don't Enoch said we we don't know much about Enoch it's only a couple lines in the Bible but we do know that he something was so great about this man his faith was so great He's listed here that God just raptured him took him up and that same faith that was in Enoch has to be the same faith that will come at the Rapture it has to be the same can you imagine living a life that pleased God so much that he says this is my bride all right sweetheart let's go and he takes us up just like he took Enoch just like he took Elijah but is but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is must believe that there is a God and he and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him think about everybody says oh I know there's a God do you really do we really know that there is a God then how come we don't have faith if he's God then he knows what's going on in my life if he's God then he knows my problems if he's God then he knows how he to get me out of him if he's God he knows how to save me if he's God he knows how to save my children my grandchildren but we have to believe that there really is a God and I think so much do we we say it we give it Lip lip service but do we really believe that there is a God if we really believe that there's a God then we should have faith in him that he can do it not faith in ourselves we always want to have faith in ourselves that's not it you have faith that he is God and that he is able by faith Noah being warned of God of things not yet as not seen as yet moved with fear here prepared an ark for the arc to the saving of his house by the which he com he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive an for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went if you read in the Bible God just calls Abraham out he says he says leave so Abraham gets his family and they just they leave he didn't tell him where he was going he just said come out so Abraham by faith just starts walking he probably walked hundreds of miles trust in God every step of the way knowing that God is there knowing that God had spoken to him we want it right now but Abraham reason that he is used as an example throughout the Bible is because he had such Faith by faith he soldiered in a Land Of Promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God Amen through faith also Sarah her self-re receiving strength to conceive seed and was delivered of child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised we are so hard on Sarah you know oh Sarah laughed you know it it was it was Abraham's Faith oh Sarah did this and you know she had Abraham go and and sleep with her concubine and then and then they had this child and then she kicks them out and and and she gets mad and all this the Bible sets Sarah as an example to us right here in Hebrews 11: 11 Sarah was a great woman and a leader she was tremendous because she had Faith she had faith in her husband's testimony that he had been with God right what a precious sister therefore sprang there even one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude ude and as the sand which is in the which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth they saw these things far off they knew they had promises Abraham had a promise you are going to be a father of many nations he said look up see all the Stars can you number them start counting them Abraham it's like one two three I lost my place all right try it again one two I lost my place there's Millions up there and God said look up Abraham that's how your seed's going to be but I don't have any children but that's how your seed's going to be and he held to that promise walking around doing everything that he could and yet making mistakes plenty of them but he had that the all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on Earth they saw as I said they saw these these promises a far off I remember I was hunting a few years ago and it was hot we were out for the morning hunt and we were coming back down in the catalinas and I looked brother John and I saw my truck and it was way out there like uncomfortably far I looked and I'm on the side of this mountain and there's this little white dot out there and it's my binoculars yeah that's I think that's my truck so start walking but I kept it in sight and it wasn't a straight journey I had to go down the valley and up the mountain and and down through the through the thickets and the bushes and I'd get up high and it would be a little bit closer and then I'd go down and and fight through the sticker bushes and everything and hot and tired and I'd get up to another Ridge and it was a little closer and that's how these these these tremendous people in this book they saw it a far off and they were willing to go get it they were willing to put their lives on the line they were willing to have faith in this because they knew I knew my truck was there I just had to get there for they that that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a a better country that is a Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city not ashamed God's not ashamed to be called our God we're ashamed of him it's sad but how many people are ashamed of God how many people won't stand up and say I'm a Christian I don't act like that I don't make fun of God I Revere prayer I Revere God and maybe I don't fit in but you know what I'll Stand with the man that died on that cross more than I will stand with the pressures that the world puts on me as I said God's not ashamed of us I believe he's proud of us I believe he loves us and we should be proud of him we should always be singing his glory we should always be talking about him never be ashamed of the Lord never be ashamed of this Bible it's everything always be willing to quote it always be willing to tell your testimony as I said we all need to have a testimony by faith Abraham when he was tried he offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac thy she seed Shall be Called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he had received received him in a figure this boy Isaac was promised to Abraham remember the stars of the sky and Abraham still was without child so so he had a baby with his concubine Sarah maybe doubted Abraham didn't really know what to do so they did this and and and Abraham's like well maybe maybe this ishmail maybe this other son Maybe that's the seed that are raised up and God said no it's going to be another one and then this young this boy is born and he and he he raises him and Isaac was not a 10-year-old or 12-year-old or seven-year-old boy like you see when Abraham brought him up to mount Mariah to sacrifice him he was like 2530 years old his beloved Son now look at my son Daniel thinking about think about taking him up knowing good and well and here he goes going up the mountain God had told him to sacrifice this boy that I gave you that didn't yet have children and take him up lay him on the altar build an altar kill him and burn it and that's what I want can you imagine so he's walking up there and here's his son going and he's like hey Dad uh yeah we have the bundle of sticks and there's no sacrifice where's the lamb where's the RAM and he says says son God will provide a sacrifice you go up there he lays his son on the altar the young man lays down he takes the knife to kill his son according to God's promise God says it's enough Abraham I know you I know you love me I know you believe me and there they looked and in this desert place there's a Ram stuck in the tree they go get that and that becomes the burnt offering that's what he's saying here he's saying that he was he was going to give up his son but whose spirit is that in in Abraham think about someone else who gave up his son and this son was greater than Isaac probably the same age 33 years old but this one really happened nailed him to a cross imagine how proud the father was of his son Jesus Christ never sinned never did a thing wrong and yet put him on the cross for everybody to laugh at to strip naked spit on his face Abraham a beautiful type of God and his son by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of Joseph Joseph and worshiped leaning upon the top of his staff brothers and sisters he blessed his family bless your family bless your children you have to have a blessing to give a blessing make sure you are right with God and lay your blessings upon your family you can do it says in the book you have every right to bless your family not only your children but your grandchildren so there's Jacob you know the story about Jacob how he how he wrestled with the angel so he's going he has his twin brother Esau and he had left and he had stolen the birth Birthright Esau was not happy with him bad deal Esau is a great warrior Jacob wasn't so Jac is like man what do I do so he sends his servants out he's got to meet he's got to come back home so he's going to meet his brother he's worried his brother is gonna kill everybody take everything away so Jacob goes before the Lord and a man comes that night an angel of God the Bible says that Jacob wrestled with God and he wrestled with him all night you know you know how that was me neither but it happened he wrestled with his Angel so finally all night long then the Sun starts coming up and the Angel's like let me go the sun's coming up and he's like I'm not going to let you go until you bless me so then the angel did some sort of a move and struck Jacob in the hip caused him to be crippled for the rest of his life life Jacob says I'm still not letting go until you bless me so then the angel gives his Blessing to Jacob now we see Jacob limped the rest of his life and here he is he's got his children before him and he limps up and he leans on his staff because of that crippled hip and he lays his blessings upon his children each one of them all 12 of them and then after that his son Joseph brings his two sons to their grandpa Jacob and has him blessed them you know the story where he crosses his hands with Ephraim and Manasseh but he laid His blessings upon them so those blessings come down you think that your grandpa and his prayers brother Burgess you think you're not benefiting from those blessings that he's given you he has blessed you I want to bless my children the same way amen lay my blessings upon them brother helped me out the other day so much and I wanted to pay him and he wouldn't take any money and I was sitting in my study and I was like Lord this brother has has done so much what can I do for him he won't take any money now I'm not saying that if you owe somebody money I give you my blessing I'm enough you have to give you have to pay them but this brother he's sitting in the back wouldn't take anything so I said Lord I'm reading this chapter right here I said Lord if I have anything let me give my blessings upon him and may he be blessed for what he's done for me amen and that's how we can do brothers and sisters we have that we have that Authority we have that ability to lay that those Blessings by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw that he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's Commandments by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter this man Moses um amram and jabed they had this son they knew that he was special they were killing the babies at that time the the boy baby throwing them to the crocodiles out in the Nile River and here they build this little basket and they take their son and they had faith in God how many of us would have faith in ourselves in hiding our children more than faith in God they put them they they felt the leading they put him in the basket and put him out among the crocodiles and Out Among everything else and he floated right down to Pharaoh's daughter then she raised him as a king he had everything that he could ever want raised him as as rich and and and as whatever he had a desire to have he was given to him and then he looked and he says you know what he said I would rather be a Christian than to have all of the the world's money and everything else all of the women all of the popularity all of the influence all of the Tik Tok all of the Instagram all of that stuff I would rather have Jesus Christ and if I'm going to be on there I am going to lift up Jesus Christ and I'm going to influence people in that way he says I don't want to be with Pharaoh he became a slave by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season Moses his greatest desire was to serve God esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of reward the English Standard Version says for he kept his eyes on the future reward right he saw that truck out in the distance and he's focusing on that he wanted that future reward and not the Quick Fix he knew he had a promise Deuteronomy he had this promise he said the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me Moses speaking among you from your fellow Israelites then you must listen to him for this is what you asked of the Lord God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said let us not hear the voice of the Lord Our God nor see this great fire anymore or we will die the Lord said unto me Moses speaking talking to the people the Lord told me what they say is good I will raise up for them a prophet like you Moses from among their fellow Israelites and I will put my words in his mouth and he will tell them everything I command I myself will call to account anyone that does not listen to my words that he that this Prophet speaks in my name who was he talking about Jesus Christ amen he says he's going to be like you Moses except better by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is visible invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them faith is action Faith is doing something faith is not sitting there and saying Lord I just want you to I just want you to be first in my life I just want you to help me Faith is is something that you do Jesus said have faith it means have faith it doesn't mean just sit back stop by the thrift store witness to someone put yourself in God's service by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians aade to do were drowned by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by by faith Rahab the Harlot perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace so so Joshua goes over he attacks um Jericho big giant walls they walk they March around the city the walls fall down they go in and Rahab had protected the spies that we went that went in before because she had the Revelation that these brothers were right in what they were saying so she hid them didn't tell on them and then Joshua's destroying Army comes in kills everybody but Rahab and her family everyone in her house because Rahab had that Faith does it say if her brothers and sisters and Mom and Dad were Sinners or not doesn't say but because of her faith they were saved because of rahab's faith and then you know what happened she was a prostitute she made her living in a bad way right but then God turned that around through her faith in God and married her to one of the greatest Generals in Joshua's Army and gave her a Wonderful Life and then she had children and those children had children and then you know who sprang up from there King David from the from the union of Rahab and Salon and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon of baric and of Samson of jeepa and of David and also Samuel and of the prophets and brothers and sisters I wish I had like all day long now I know what this brother's saying when he wrote this like we can keep going let's talk about all of these who through faith subdued Kingdom wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions I'm not and what more shall I say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and Samson and jeepa and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained the obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again the shunamite woman and Elisha the boy died Elisha came and laid his body upon the boy and he came back to life again same happen happened with his predecessor Elijah and the widow woman women received their dead to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings Y moreover over bonds and imprisonment they were stoned believe it was Zechariah that was stoned the prophet and others they were son aunder Isaiah son in half they were tempted they were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute and Afflicted and tormented John the Baptist in the New Testament wandered about in his goat skin being destitute T tormented didn't have anything he ate Grasshoppers and honey that was his that was his diet but they took god seriously they put God's word first these were great people who put faith into action they actually did it they didn't just talk about it they didn't just teach it they did it couple minutes but they were brothers and sisters they were fallible normal people that had problems every single one of them they they weren't these great people on a pedestal that you might think here they they they did things wrong but it's okay Moses was a murderer he forgot to circumcise his son Abraham gave his wife to another man because he was afraid of being killed Sarah laughed at the promise of God Noah got drunk when he got off the ark planted a Vineyard made some wine got drunk Rahab was a prostitute they were average ordinary people just like you and me yes but they put God first they had faith and they changed the world and we can do that of whom the world is not worthy amen H that is so beautiful of whom the world was not one worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provide some better thing for us than these people a better thing for us that they without us should be made perfect better than the burning bush experienced with Moses better than than David killing Goliath better than the walls of Jericho coming down with Joshua better than the prostitute Rahab finding a Godly husband better than all of these things better than the blessings that Jacob gave to his sons better for us because they had not received the promise of Jesus Christ yet and we have our faith should be higher than theirs it should be we should be walking in faith saying Lord you've done all of these things I read in my Bible read read Hebrews 11 wherefore we wherefore seeing we are Al we also are encompassed about with so great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight Hebrews 121 let us lay aside every weight and the sin do easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us this cloud of witness that's all over the place it's in the Bible here all of these great men and women of God and we read it and it's everywhere we have no excuse we're surrounded by this now let us run the same race that they ran looking unto Jesus it's better than my truck out there a few miles away keeping your your eye on the cross looking at looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God amen amen brothers and sisters we live below yes our means we live below what we were called for we should be so much more now look at that brother that that spoke yesterday I look at him and I think what a man but he started right with his family he started with his family got everything in order with his family and then he started reaching out and he started helping other people but he started right at home he built this foundation and now he's helped hundreds or even thousands of people because he was led by faith to do these things we were Made for More We Were Made for More than we give we were made for more than we do every one of us every person in this building was made for more listen to this I know who I am because

for myself don't lay in that grave that you made that I've made get up and get out of it make a change have faith in God know that it's not even your faith it's Christ's faith that comes into you so
