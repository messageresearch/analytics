[42:37] spiritual vitamins as it was it helps
[42:40] the sheep to grow into strong faith
[42:43] in our god
[42:45] and so i appreciate such man
[42:47] and now
[42:49] speaking this morning on the thought of
[42:51] the church growing see coming like a
[42:55] seed in the ground
[42:56] and that seed as its planting grows from
[42:59] glory unto glory
[43:01] and
[43:02] it becomes after a while into a blossom
[43:05] and then goes back to the seed
[43:08] that's like the original seed that was
[43:09] planted
[43:11] and so has the church been the church
[43:13] age started in this last days after the
[43:16] dark ages it started with martin luther
[43:18] in the reformation preaching
[43:20] justification by faith
[43:23] after his time and they organized the
[43:25] church it died out
[43:27] and then there comes swingly after
[43:28] luther and swingley didn't even believe
[43:30] in the virgin birth he went over into
[43:32] switzerland they still don't believe and
[43:35] the swingly doctrine do not believe that
[43:37] jesus was virgin born they said he was
[43:39] the son of joseph call the son of god
[43:42] but that takes the whole prop out from
[43:44] under uh the whole foundation of
[43:46] christianity he was virgin born or he's
[43:49] just a man like you or i
[43:51] he was the son of god and then after
[43:53] that come calvin and on and on finally
[43:56] the church got in such a condition there
[43:58] kind of had to have another reformation
[44:00] and god sent john wesley with a message
[44:03] of sanctification cleansiness of the
[44:06] spirit
[44:07] and then he and whitfield and many of
[44:10] them went on in the great reformation
[44:12] and asbury they come to the united
[44:14] states and that great revival saved
[44:16] england and the world at that time
[44:19] what did they do after them founders
[44:21] died out they began to organize upon
[44:23] their doctrine and the first thing you
[44:24] know they made an organization
[44:26] then we had others break off mayor such
[44:28] as alexander campbell john smith from
[44:30] the baptist church and so forth and then
[44:32] the nazarene pilgrim holiness and others
[44:34] come on and then come the great
[44:36] reformation again pentecost coming out
[44:38] of those organizations with the
[44:40] restoration of the gifts speaking in
[44:42] tongues divine healing great miracles
[44:45] and signs come off that went for a long
[44:47] time it's been 50 about 58 years now
[44:50] since the holy spirit began to fall on
[44:52] old azusa street out in california
[44:54] you're in the united states where it
[44:55] started falling the great
[44:57] time come then what did pentecost do one
[45:00] made him an organization one said he's
[45:02] coming on a white horse another no white
[45:03] cloud and the way they went the
[45:05] organizations split up
[45:07] breaking up the brotherhood among the
[45:09] people and just like israel little did
[45:12] israel know
[45:13] that when they were shouting the victory
[45:15] on the bank
[45:16] of the river they were only about four
[45:19] days journey about 40 miles away from
[45:22] the promised land they didn't realize
[45:24] they were
[45:25] 40 years it would take them but what was
[45:28] it
[45:28] grace had provided them a profit a
[45:31] pillar of fire a sacrifice lamb a
[45:34] deliverance and still they wanted a law
[45:37] they wanted something they could have
[45:39] something to do into they want to put
[45:40] their hands to it that's the most
[45:42] rational mistake they ever made and
[45:44] exodus 19 when israel rejected grace and
[45:48] accepted law
[45:49] and then what did they do he just let
[45:52] them stay right there in the wilderness
[45:54] for 40 years they plant vineyards and
[45:57] they eat fruit and they married wives
[46:00] they raised children until that old
[46:02] generation died off and another
[46:04] generation come on 40 years later and
[46:07] not hardly 40 hours away but had to wait
[46:10] for 40 years
[46:12] before they went over and then a new
[46:13] leader came in joshua
[46:16] and they moved on into the land with the
[46:17] new group now
[46:20] i think it's a very beautiful type here
[46:22] that we find out
[46:23] long ago when our forefathers in the
[46:25] pentecost they raised up they had the
[46:28] old general counsel from that form of
[46:30] the assemblies of god out of that come
[46:31] the ubc and then united and so forth
[46:34] till they got the organization after
[46:36] organizations fussing and fighting god
[46:38] just let them sit right there
[46:40] merry wives
[46:41] raise children
[46:43] speak in tongues shout the spirit
[46:45] but now there's a new group come up
[46:49] they were only just a few days from the
[46:50] promised land
[46:52] all these blessings ahead was fine but
[46:54] you remember the whole land belonged to
[46:57] them
[46:58] now we're fixing to go into the promised
[47:00] land so may the lord help us as we look
[47:03] upon these things
[47:04] just like the pyramid did you notice how
[47:07] the pyramid was made
[47:08] not a pyramid doctrine now
[47:10] just a pyramid look on your one dollar
[47:12] bill
[47:13] the seal of the united states is that
[47:15] eagle well why does it stay over there
[47:17] on the pier made the great seal
[47:20] why would it be greater here in the
[47:21] united states and and the seal of the
[47:23] united states
[47:24] the great seal the eye watching and the
[47:28] the capstone that goes upon the pyramid
[47:32] was
[47:33] it was rejected it never was on the
[47:35] pyramid isn't to this day the stone was
[47:39] scrolling late plain but
[47:40] it never was put on the capstone why
[47:43] when enoch and them in the early days
[47:45] built the pyramids down in egypt we find
[47:48] out and in there they knew that the
[47:50] cornerstone the capstone would be
[47:52] rejected
[47:53] and that pair made his puzzle perfectly
[47:55] together too they don't need martyr
[47:57] it was so mechanically hewed out until
[48:00] one stone fits against the other so
[48:02] tight you can't even put a razor blade
[48:04] between them
[48:06] now
[48:07] it's kept weeping up and now it's all
[48:09] honed off on top ready for the capstone
[48:12] when it will come that's the way god's
[48:14] brought his church
[48:16] from justification sanctification
[48:18] baptism the holy spirit and now the
[48:20] ministry
[48:22] of the spirit which is the
[48:24] what quickens the word that ministry in
[48:27] the church will have to be just exactly
[48:29] like this just like this when my shadow
[48:32] here of my hand if i never see my hand
[48:35] seen the shadow it's kind of it gets
[48:37] pale as it gets away but it gets closer
[48:39] and closer the negative and positive are
[48:42] coming together until they both become
[48:43] the same thing
[48:45] and that's exactly when the church and
[48:47] the word has to be one like jesus and
[48:49] god was one just exactly the god has was
[48:53] in christ reconciling the world to
[48:55] himself and so will christ have to be in
[48:57] the church the anointed of the word to
[49:00] make everything fulfilled and that's a
[49:01] capstone that comes up on the last
[49:04] church age
[49:05] not the lady ocean now it's a calling
[49:08] out of that a bride out of a church
[49:11] church out of a church in other words
[49:13] it's like he called a nation out of a
[49:14] nation in egypt and now we're living in
[49:17] that day
[49:18] and we're grateful for these great
[49:20] things that we've been seeing now
[49:22] tomorrow afternoon the lord willing is
[49:25] going to be the closing of this service
[49:28] this part of the service and uh we're
[49:30] going to designate that all together for
[49:33] praying for the sick
[49:34] and everybody that wants to be prayed
[49:36] for may come out and get a prayer card
[49:39] to come through the prayer line now the
[49:40] reason we get prayer cards on these is
[49:42] keep them lined up and then if you don't
[49:44] then just keep passing around around
[49:46] around and see you there so you we give
[49:48] them a prayer card you have a prayer
[49:49] card you come in the line and you'll see
[49:52] and believe you'll see the glory of god
[49:54] take place it'll be great
[49:57] and now we thank you for all that you
[49:59] have done and for the great welcome that
[50:02] we've had amongst these ministry
[50:04] brothers and so forth now tomorrow is
[50:06] sunday
[50:08] and these churches will be open there'll
[50:09] be no service here tomorrow morning it'd
[50:11] be sunday school and you visitors i've
[50:14] got some friends in here myself
[50:16] at uh it's with us in a party and some
[50:19] has come down from my home town
[50:22] here to be with us now these are the man
[50:25] that sponsors this meeting they believe
[50:28] this type of meeting if i lived here in
[50:31] this city i'd belong to one of their
[50:34] churches i certainly would because they
[50:36] believe the same thing that i believe
[50:37] and i belong to one of their churches if
[50:40] i lived here and you gave your life to
[50:42] christ this week and you don't have a
[50:44] church home why don't you talk it over
[50:45] with them
[50:47] they believe this same thing
[50:49] or they wouldn't be sitting up here
[50:50] represented see so now you
[50:53] you you find your nice one of these nice
[50:55] churches tomorrow and go to it and i'm
[50:57] sure they'll do you good they'll help
[50:59] you they'll help you to believe and if
[51:01] you haven't been baptized ask them if
[51:03] you haven't received the holy ghost ask
[51:04] them about it and they'll help you right
[51:07] on through to christ and shepherd you
[51:08] right on down the road until he returns
[51:12] now the lord bless each one of you and
[51:14] now
[51:15] you know the presbyterians are always
[51:17] raising up and setting down they say
[51:20] and i'm not a presbyterian but i do
[51:22] believe that when we read the word we
[51:24] ought to stand because it's an honor to
[51:27] god to stand is like we salute the flag
[51:29] or pledge allegiance or what more and
[51:31] now
[51:32] for tonight i have chosen some scripture
[51:34] reading here out of the book of saint
[51:37] luke the seventh chapter beginning with
[51:38] the 36th verse
[51:41] and now all week long i've been working
[51:44] on a
[51:45] thought that come to me on the road
[51:47] coming down here on the unveiling
[51:51] of the
[51:52] mighty god
[51:54] but when i got through looking at my
[51:55] scriptures and things i had nearly 20
[51:57] pages
[51:58] so i never get through that no hour here
[52:01] so i thought i'd have to change it
[52:03] tonight so
[52:04] i have
[52:05] i believe it's will of the lord and i
[52:07] say these things now in seventh chapter
[52:10] of saint luke and the 36th verse
[52:13] one of the pharisees desired him that he
[52:16] would eat with him
[52:18] and he went into the pharisees house and
[52:21] sat down to meet
[52:23] and behold a woman in the city which was
[52:25] a sinner
[52:28] when she knew that jesus sat at meat in
[52:30] the pharisees house brought an
[52:32] ambassador box of ointment and stood at
[52:36] his feet behind him weeping and began to
[52:39] wash his feet with tears and did wipe
[52:42] them
[52:43] with the hairs of her head
[52:46] and kissed his feet and anointed them
[52:49] with the ointment
[52:50] now when the pharisee
[52:52] which had been him saw it
[52:55] he spake within himself
[52:59] remember not out loud but then himself
[53:02] saying
[53:03] if this man was a prophet
[53:06] he would know
[53:07] who and what manner of woman this is
[53:10] that touched him for she is
[53:12] a sinner
[53:14] jesus answered and said unto him simon
[53:19] i have somewhat to say unto thee
[53:21] and he said
[53:23] master say on
[53:25] there was a certain creditor which had
[53:30] two debtors
[53:31] and they owed
[53:34] one owed 500 pence and the other 50
[53:38] and when they had nothing to pay he
[53:40] frankly forgave
[53:42] them both
[53:43] tell me therefore which of them
[53:46] will love him most
[53:48] simon answered and said
[53:51] i suppose that he to whom he forgave the
[53:54] most
[53:55] and he said unto him thou as rightly
[53:57] judged
[53:58] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[54:01] simon
[54:03] seest thou this woman
[54:06] i entered into thy house thou gives me
[54:08] no water for my feet
[54:10] but she has washed my feet with tears
[54:14] and has wiped them with the hairs of her
[54:16] head
[54:17] and thou giveth me no kiss
[54:20] but this woman since the time i came in
[54:23] has not ceased to kiss my feet
[54:26] my head with all thou didst not anoint
[54:29] but this woman has anointed my feet with
[54:33] aura
[54:34] wherefore i say unto her
[54:38] say unto thee her sins which were many
[54:41] are forgiven
[54:43] for she loved much
[54:45] but to whom little
[54:47] is forgiven the same loveth little
[54:51] and he said unto her thy sins are
[54:53] forgiven and they that set at me with
[54:56] him begin to say within themselves
[55:00] who is this that forgive us sins
[55:03] also
[55:04] and he said to the woman thy faith is
[55:07] say thee go in peace
[55:10] let us pray
[55:11] lord jesus
[55:13] this story
[55:15] has taken place
[55:17] many years ago but it's a true story
[55:22] for it is written in the pages of our
[55:24] bible
[55:25] and we know that it's true
[55:28] and now
[55:30] we would by no means try to portray this
[55:33] again tonight
[55:35] but we would like for you to help us
[55:39] to bring this as a message tonight
[55:42] to the people
[55:44] that they might see
[55:46] that that you're still the same lord
[55:50] jesus
[55:51] and we pray for your blessings upon us
[55:54] all as we are needy people
[55:56] we have need of thee lord
[55:59] and
[56:00] we believe tonight though we see you
[56:03] make the blind the sea and the death to
[56:06] here and the lame to walk
[56:09] and by doctor's statements have seen you
[56:12] raise up five people from the dead
[56:16] in different times different nations
[56:20] but yet lord i believe the most sickest
[56:22] thing i know of tonight is the body of
[56:24] christ here on earth
[56:26] the church
[56:28] it's really safe
[56:32] heal it tonight lord
[56:35] this potion that sets your together this
[56:38] this bunch of soul journey here in in
[56:40] tampa this lovely bunch of people
[56:44] lord heal every womb tonight
[56:48] let the spirit grant this to us
[56:51] for we asked it in jesus name and for
[56:54] his honor
[56:55] for his glory here in this city or we
[56:58] are a journey
[56:59] amen
[57:01] let me see
[57:05] i should call it now just for a few
[57:07] moments
[57:08] and um
[57:10] try not each night i have to apologize
[57:12] to you because it you've been so nice
[57:15] and i you're such an easy audience to
[57:17] preach to
[57:18] uh you just don't know when to stop
[57:21] and that makes the minister know that
[57:23] you're feeding or receiving the words
[57:25] that i'm seeing
[57:27] and i'll come to you on a bit i'm the
[57:29] tardis i've ever been and i don't know
[57:30] when see i haven't let up since
[57:32] christmas
[57:33] i'm going right from here to tucson to
[57:35] start again come right from there to go
[57:37] to british columbia to baptize a whole
[57:39] tribe of indians that are led to christ
[57:42] were formerly catholic last fall was on
[57:44] a hunting trip and the whole group gave
[57:46] their heart to christ by the healing of
[57:48] the mother one of the mothers that the
[57:50] doctors no one could touch her she's
[57:52] laying dying and they want me to come
[57:54] back as soon as the ice gets melted so
[57:56] it gets 85 below zero there and so and i
[57:59] smell it i'm taking them and all a great
[58:01] bunch of trappers and hunters up down
[58:03] alaska and highway are all meeting with
[58:05] me to be baptized and accepting christ
[58:08] they seen the lord show a vision of a
[58:10] certain thing where a certain bear would
[58:12] be how much he'd weigh what kind he was
[58:15] and where a certain animal would be
[58:16] staying
[58:17] who would be there and what to be
[58:19] wearing and all about it and told him
[58:20] before it happened and they said it's
[58:22] not even that kind of things in this
[58:23] country and we went right straight to it
[58:25] and happened word by word
[58:28] the trophies hangs in my room today
[58:31] they said we want to be baptized too
[58:34] rough
[58:35] man
[58:37] but you know
[58:38] he's got seed laying everywhere
[58:41] my subject tonight is jesus
[58:44] keeps all his appointments
[58:48] i want you to bear that old mind as we
[58:49] speak
[58:51] and i i won't talk too long
[58:54] and i want you to think it over now that
[58:56] remember you've got to meet this one
[58:58] that's present with us tonight someday
[59:01] now
[59:02] it must have been
[59:04] almost sundown
[59:06] when our sitting starts out tonight
[59:09] it must have been about sundown
[59:12] and this courier
[59:14] had run all day maybe two or three days
[59:17] he was trying to find him he went down
[59:20] maybe almost from dan to besheba
[59:24] because jesus in his ministry
[59:27] was going to
[59:29] speak here
[59:30] perform his signs and wonders
[59:33] and the people are all together he would
[59:34] take off somewhere else
[59:36] i must go to another city
[59:38] and it had a hard time
[59:41] perhaps it went over to capernaum and
[59:43] they said well he left you a week ago we
[59:45] don't know exactly where he went but he
[59:48] went somewhere else and he oh he was
[59:51] tired his hair was wet was perspiration
[59:55] his legs were dusty and sweaty
[59:58] and
[59:59] as he come up into the party
[1:00:02] where jesus had been speaking
[1:00:05] and jesus also was tired he'd been
[1:00:08] speaking all day his mouth was dry
[1:00:10] from much speaking and his hands begin
[1:00:13] to look trembling and his eyes weary as
[1:00:16] the sun began to sink
[1:00:19] and
[1:00:20] he wanted to see jesus
[1:00:23] he had a message for him
[1:00:25] and now jesus had 12 men around him that
[1:00:28] kept the people away from him
[1:00:30] uh of course he just
[1:00:32] coming up on him and so the
[1:00:34] i'm making this in a drama so that
[1:00:36] everybody can catch it
[1:00:38] and so
[1:00:38] we find that in this
[1:00:41] jesus man he must have come let's say he
[1:00:43] come to philip
[1:00:45] and philip might have said something
[1:00:46] like this uh uh sir or young fella we
[1:00:50] would certainly like to let you see
[1:00:52] the master but but he's so tired we just
[1:00:56] got to watch him because he he just goes
[1:00:59] to the almost drops and we've been in so
[1:01:01] many meetings and so forth lately to uh
[1:01:04] i'm sorry i don't believe we can do it
[1:01:06] but he says i i have a note here that
[1:01:10] comes from a very important man in
[1:01:13] religious realms
[1:01:15] and it's an invitation for your master
[1:01:17] which will be a great
[1:01:19] great thing if if he shall go and i'm a
[1:01:22] scene because i've been commissioned
[1:01:24] that i must take this note to him and
[1:01:27] see that he gets it personally
[1:01:30] so finally if they tuck him up to the
[1:01:33] lord jesus and
[1:01:35] while he was looking at him the lord
[1:01:37] jesus perhaps leaving his place pulpit
[1:01:39] from where he was speaking were the
[1:01:41] disciples and them and fixed for him to
[1:01:43] talk from
[1:01:44] as he was looking why
[1:01:46] he looked upon the young man he must
[1:01:48] have liked him
[1:01:49] and the young man told him he said i am
[1:01:52] on a errand sir
[1:01:55] and there's a very
[1:01:57] high
[1:01:58] ranking man down in a certain city
[1:02:01] and he's a pharisee the strictest of the
[1:02:04] religions
[1:02:05] and he's uh he's making a dinner a great
[1:02:10] time of banquet
[1:02:11] and he wants you to come to be the guest
[1:02:14] of honor
[1:02:16] and he's uh manny would like to attend
[1:02:18] this banquet but he has selected you and
[1:02:21] i've been three days trying to find you
[1:02:24] across the country
[1:02:26] and i was certainly happy to get your
[1:02:28] sir i'll deliver this note to you from
[1:02:31] it and from him and he took the note and
[1:02:33] read it and he find out that this
[1:02:35] certain pharisee had was making a feast
[1:02:38] and and had bid him to come down and be
[1:02:40] a guest of honor with him
[1:02:42] so
[1:02:43] jesus standing for a few moments and
[1:02:45] looking at the young man and yet as busy
[1:02:49] as he was
[1:02:51] but you can never invite him but what
[1:02:53] he'll come
[1:02:54] i don't care what the situation is he'll
[1:02:57] come
[1:02:58] he uh said you tell your your master
[1:03:02] that i'll be there on this certain day
[1:03:05] at this certain time i'll be there
[1:03:08] and the courier must smile satisfied and
[1:03:12] turned away and run off down the hill to
[1:03:14] take the good news back to his master
[1:03:16] that he had succeeded in getting the
[1:03:18] message to this one that he wanted
[1:03:22] what was the matter with that courier
[1:03:25] how could it be
[1:03:29] was he conscious of what he done
[1:03:33] the first time maybe in his life that he
[1:03:35] ever stood in the presence of jesus
[1:03:39] and never even asked forgiveness of his
[1:03:41] sins
[1:03:43] he never he never took the opportunity
[1:03:47] oh
[1:03:48] how
[1:03:49] it's the same way with people today many
[1:03:52] times they they're realize that they're
[1:03:54] in his presence and never ask
[1:03:56] forgiveness well that
[1:03:59] he maybe never presented the opportunity
[1:04:02] another time and turned down his
[1:04:04] last opportunity to ask forgiveness
[1:04:08] how could he ever have done that
[1:04:11] how could this boy ever so been
[1:04:13] wrapped up
[1:04:15] and bringing this message from his
[1:04:17] master that he failed in the presence of
[1:04:20] the son of god that asked forgiveness it
[1:04:22] was all a business
[1:04:24] affair
[1:04:26] and you know that's something like the
[1:04:28] people today
[1:04:30] church christ has become
[1:04:32] a a business affair
[1:04:35] or or social affair
[1:04:37] to join church and get just a a a little
[1:04:41] better social standing for your business
[1:04:43] or something to stand out a little
[1:04:45] better in the neighborhood it is the
[1:04:47] thing of of really coming and repenting
[1:04:50] like a sinner should do
[1:04:53] many times in church people are brought
[1:04:55] right in the presence of christ
[1:04:58] and turn away and do as rational thing
[1:05:01] as this courier uh did
[1:05:05] oh you should have fell upon his knees
[1:05:07] when he first realized
[1:05:09] that it was who he was and he's saying
[1:05:12] master
[1:05:13] i have a message for you but first i
[1:05:16] want you to forgive me
[1:05:18] that would have been the right approach
[1:05:20] and then if there's any business to be
[1:05:22] done let that be done later but to first
[1:05:24] get his own soul right with god
[1:05:27] that's why i think so much healing
[1:05:29] becomes a failure
[1:05:31] or professed healing because the first
[1:05:33] place the people are not ready for
[1:05:36] healing
[1:05:37] they won't confess their wrongs the
[1:05:39] bible said confess your faults one to
[1:05:41] another and pray one for the other
[1:05:44] and we're not willing to do that if we
[1:05:46] can take the healing and go ahead and go
[1:05:48] on back and do what we was doing they
[1:05:50] would accept that but when it comes to
[1:05:52] really first coming and getting right
[1:05:55] with god people don't want to do that
[1:05:57] and that's the reason it throws a a bad
[1:06:01] a damper over divine healing you see so
[1:06:03] many people that walk in like it walk
[1:06:05] out and don't and god knows all about
[1:06:08] those things
[1:06:09] now this fellow made a real rational
[1:06:12] thing we would think
[1:06:14] we would think if i could only take his
[1:06:16] place
[1:06:17] if i could go up before his throne and
[1:06:20] take a message the first thing i would
[1:06:22] do what would you do be interested in
[1:06:23] what your organization has sent you up
[1:06:25] there to find out about
[1:06:29] or would you be looking around and see
[1:06:30] how heaven was decorated
[1:06:32] or in his presence with the first thing
[1:06:34] you say lord god forgive me a sinner
[1:06:38] that would be the right thing to do
[1:06:41] now
[1:06:42] as jesus watched the boy and
[1:06:45] as he went away
[1:06:47] might come in his mind why didn't that
[1:06:49] boy do that
[1:06:50] was because he wasn't conscious
[1:06:53] who that was
[1:06:56] may i say this not sacrilegious
[1:06:59] may i say this not because it's this
[1:07:01] meeting
[1:07:02] or any meeting but i think that's what's
[1:07:04] the matter today
[1:07:06] people are not conscious of it amen
[1:07:10] they see the scripture exactly
[1:07:12] identified
[1:07:14] but they're not conscious of who it is
[1:07:17] they'll see something and they say oh
[1:07:19] that was wonderful that was fine
[1:07:21] but you're not conscious of what it is
[1:07:25] if it was there to be a repentance going
[1:07:27] on weeping and crying
[1:07:30] the city would have such a revival to
[1:07:32] half of you be locked up before morning
[1:07:35] it's right if we be conscious of what it
[1:07:38] is and we pass by many times
[1:07:40] and missed the opportunity
[1:07:42] but not being conscious i don't think
[1:07:44] the boy really realized he'd been raised
[1:07:46] up among this pharisee which was a a a
[1:07:49] great ruler a prince or a religious man
[1:07:53] and he'd been raised up with him and and
[1:07:55] and just took his side of religion and
[1:07:57] the pharisees
[1:07:59] laughed at jesus and made fun of him or
[1:08:01] something that he did as they in that
[1:08:02] day and that he just thought it off that
[1:08:05] wasn't enough but it's an ordinary
[1:08:06] message he had to deliver he just sat
[1:08:08] there and he's in his presence and that
[1:08:10] was all it was to him it didn't mean
[1:08:11] nothing to him but if he'd been
[1:08:12] conscious
[1:08:14] that boy could rise up from the dead
[1:08:16] today and set in this meeting this week
[1:08:19] he'd have done something about it
[1:08:21] he'd have a testimony that would have
[1:08:23] shook us all
[1:08:26] but he wasn't conscious
[1:08:29] now in the scene here there's something
[1:08:32] wrong
[1:08:34] it is it isn't
[1:08:37] as jesus watched that boy go away tired
[1:08:40] and weary
[1:08:41] but the whole setting there's something
[1:08:43] wrong
[1:08:45] them pharisees hated jesus
[1:08:48] why would they invite him for a guest of
[1:08:50] honor
[1:08:51] when they hated him
[1:08:54] that pharisee had a as the old
[1:08:57] gambler's expression he had us
[1:09:00] some of his sleeve
[1:09:02] he had a trick
[1:09:04] card in his sleep
[1:09:06] because they hated jesus
[1:09:09] i believe jesus realized that right then
[1:09:12] see people must have things in common
[1:09:16] my mother
[1:09:18] she used to have an expression birds of
[1:09:20] a feather flock together
[1:09:22] you don't see you don't see buzzards and
[1:09:25] doves feeding together
[1:09:27] there there one's a scavenger and the
[1:09:30] dove couldn't eat the buzzard's food
[1:09:31] because he don't have any gold
[1:09:35] he couldn't digest it
[1:09:37] and you don't see
[1:09:38] believers and unbelievers together
[1:09:40] unless there's some kind of a purpose
[1:09:42] bar
[1:09:43] there's something something wrong
[1:09:47] this guy
[1:09:48] had a trick up his sleeve you want to
[1:09:51] play it on jesus
[1:09:53] how you take people like you take young
[1:09:56] people young teenage children they don't
[1:09:59] like to be around the old folks because
[1:10:01] they they have things in common
[1:10:03] the young married couples they have
[1:10:05] things in common the old people they
[1:10:08] don't want to be around the kids so much
[1:10:10] they they got things in common when you
[1:10:12] see a little girl hanging with grandma
[1:10:15] all the time
[1:10:16] now there's there's something wrong
[1:10:18] there's too much difference in their age
[1:10:20] she's either grandma's pet or grandma's
[1:10:22] got a sack of candy somewhere see
[1:10:25] there's a trick somewhere i got a
[1:10:26] grandchild myself and i
[1:10:28] know there's a little trick somewhere
[1:10:31] seen and you see her hanging around
[1:10:33] grandma grandma's got a uh sack of candy
[1:10:36] or something
[1:10:38] so this pharisee had something up his
[1:10:41] sleeve it all happened at a ministerial
[1:10:43] meeting
[1:10:45] where they gathered together and the
[1:10:47] subject was discussed about this fellow
[1:10:49] who called himself a prophet
[1:10:53] and they didn't believe he was a prophet
[1:10:56] because they couldn't see a man that
[1:10:58] wouldn't go along with them and all
[1:11:00] their doctrine that could be a prophet
[1:11:04] and so in this ministerial meeting they
[1:11:06] had decided that he wasn't a prophet and
[1:11:08] this old pharisee was going to prove it
[1:11:10] to him that he wasn't a prophet
[1:11:13] the pharisee was going to
[1:11:17] to make it sure and to show the
[1:11:19] congregation all the people in that city
[1:11:21] that he wasn't a prophet before he ever
[1:11:23] visit the city he'd never been in that
[1:11:24] city before so before he come he's going
[1:11:28] to expose him
[1:11:30] all that
[1:11:31] spirit it still lives
[1:11:34] going to expose it do something to
[1:11:36] hinder the meaning that he would have
[1:11:37] had there
[1:11:39] so we find out that he said i'll make a
[1:11:41] dinner
[1:11:42] and i'll invite everybody and get
[1:11:43] everybody in the city around and then
[1:11:45] we'll prove that he's not no prophet
[1:11:48] we'll prove it
[1:11:49] so
[1:11:51] pharisee might have thought that if he
[1:11:52] were doing this he would uh he would uh
[1:11:55] got a little uh maybe become after a
[1:11:57] while one of the presbyters or something
[1:11:58] he'd
[1:11:59] it really made a hit with his group
[1:12:02] he was going to make fun at the banquet
[1:12:05] of the lord jesus to prove that he was
[1:12:07] the prophet do put him on the spot
[1:12:09] somewhere
[1:12:11] then he would be a
[1:12:13] big fellow among them become some great
[1:12:15] man
[1:12:16] now we find out
[1:12:18] that the courier returns back and tells
[1:12:20] his master i found him
[1:12:23] he promised
[1:12:25] and he'll be here because i just tell
[1:12:26] the way he acted he'll be here
[1:12:29] all right
[1:12:30] now the pharisee waited for this certain
[1:12:32] time and they know when to make this
[1:12:34] banquet when everything was just right
[1:12:36] perhaps you will think in our little
[1:12:37] drama tonight that that he made it in a
[1:12:40] time when the grapes was ripe if he was
[1:12:42] ever in palestine when a great time or
[1:12:44] even in california when i'm great big
[1:12:46] clusters of grapes are just bleeding
[1:12:48] right the whole
[1:12:50] uh
[1:12:52] country the valley is just full of that
[1:12:55] sweet smelling odor from those grapes he
[1:12:57] knows just when to make it right so he
[1:13:00] set that time on a certain day they
[1:13:02] would have this feast
[1:13:05] and finally the time come with when the
[1:13:07] feast was going to be carried on and he
[1:13:09] invited everybody to come that he could
[1:13:12] to come up all the celebrity and all the
[1:13:14] associations and so forth and all the
[1:13:17] clubs that was in the city that he
[1:13:19] belonged to it was all coming out to his
[1:13:21] great fine palace that set out high
[1:13:25] stood out as an estate there in the city
[1:13:29] and the time arrived for this to be done
[1:13:32] of course the yard was all taken care of
[1:13:34] and the tables were all set and the
[1:13:37] banquet room ready and then
[1:13:40] now he's going to have to take care of
[1:13:42] the his guests when they come any host
[1:13:44] will do that so he had to hire some
[1:13:47] stable boys because some of his hosts
[1:13:50] would be or some of his guests would be
[1:13:51] coming on uh chariots and some riding on
[1:13:55] mules some walking
[1:13:57] so anyone that makes a uh has a banquet
[1:14:01] has to make ready to entertain their
[1:14:03] guests
[1:14:04] so pharisee got everything just fixed up
[1:14:07] in all of his servants and got them
[1:14:08] ready got the stable boys where they
[1:14:11] could take the horses and all the fodder
[1:14:13] and stuff ready for him and
[1:14:15] then
[1:14:16] you had an innkeeper or door keeper that
[1:14:19] had to take up the invitations cause you
[1:14:22] you could not come unless she was
[1:14:23] invited
[1:14:24] and to take up the invitations he had
[1:14:26] their names down ever who was going to
[1:14:28] be there and they come they identified
[1:14:29] their name and so they could come in
[1:14:32] then let's just look what what they had
[1:14:35] to do for a while i've been in the
[1:14:36] orients and
[1:14:37] maybe many of your has and watch how
[1:14:39] they do it it's it's really striking and
[1:14:42] you notice then when everything's taken
[1:14:44] care of then when they come in the door
[1:14:46] the first thing the the keeper the door
[1:14:49] as to the r
[1:14:51] and they tell who they are he looks on
[1:14:53] his list and here's the name then he
[1:14:55] checks it then what he does he takes his
[1:14:57] staff sets it in the corner
[1:15:00] the boys takes the horses if he's
[1:15:02] walking or if he's on the horse and puts
[1:15:04] it in the stable now the next thing he
[1:15:06] does he enters into a hall
[1:15:09] and in here there's a bunch of a man
[1:15:12] what's called
[1:15:13] the
[1:15:15] feet washers
[1:15:16] the flunkies it's the lowest paid job
[1:15:20] there is is the foot wash flunky and to
[1:15:23] think of it we who think we're somebody
[1:15:25] and our lord
[1:15:27] identified himself on earth as a foot
[1:15:30] wash flunky
[1:15:31] so exactly what he did and then we think
[1:15:33] we're somebody
[1:15:35] we'll run off here to school and get a
[1:15:37] little
[1:15:38] education in it
[1:15:39] and learn to say a few
[1:15:42] big words and come back and put on a
[1:15:45] suit of clothes and walk out here and
[1:15:47] want to be called
[1:15:49] dr reverend or somebody
[1:15:52] i was up at a big museum not long ago
[1:15:54] and looking at some of the estimation of
[1:15:57] a man weighed a 150 pound how much
[1:16:00] chemicals there was in his body you know
[1:16:02] how much there is when he's all rendered
[1:16:03] up is worth 84 cents
[1:16:06] then you'll put a ten dollar hat on at
[1:16:08] 84 cents and a 500 mink coat and turn
[1:16:11] your nose up if it rained it would drown
[1:16:12] you and then go along
[1:16:14] taking care of that 84 cents
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:18] thinking you're somebody
[1:16:20] and you don't give a care you act like
[1:16:23] it about that soul it's worth 10 million
[1:16:25] worlds
[1:16:30] the difference the rational how we can
[1:16:32] get
[1:16:34] now
[1:16:35] this foot wash flunky
[1:16:38] he had to wash their feet now in the
[1:16:40] when you travel in palestine the
[1:16:42] palestinian garment is a robe it hangs
[1:16:44] low
[1:16:45] and then the underneath garment this
[1:16:47] comes to about the calf of the leg here
[1:16:50] for the underneath garment
[1:16:52] and as the the animals and the man
[1:16:55] travel the same trail
[1:16:57] the animals of course going along the
[1:16:59] trail and and um and as as they travel
[1:17:03] the same trail and and the dust would
[1:17:05] come up from where the animals had been
[1:17:07] and it was a stink in the dust and it
[1:17:09] got on their feet when they were
[1:17:11] perspiring and their feet was
[1:17:13] shot with sandals
[1:17:16] and that would get all full of
[1:17:18] perspiration and and be wet
[1:17:21] sticky and then this stink from where
[1:17:23] the animals across the trail would the
[1:17:26] palestinian garments sweeping like a
[1:17:28] skirt
[1:17:29] down low would pick up this dust and it
[1:17:31] would get beneath here and get all over
[1:17:33] their feet and over their their limbs
[1:17:35] and they really
[1:17:36] smell like that trail
[1:17:39] where the animals have been so coming
[1:17:41] into a home like those pharisees had
[1:17:44] they're sent into persian got those
[1:17:46] great big fine rugs and and everything
[1:17:49] why
[1:17:50] you wouldn't feel welcome to come in
[1:17:52] before the host and uh and and then be
[1:17:55] all stinky like that
[1:17:57] so they had a way of taking care of that
[1:17:59] they had a foot wash flunky
[1:18:02] and he stayed there and as soon as you
[1:18:04] come in and your name was registered the
[1:18:06] boys taking the horses or your animals
[1:18:09] and taking them back to feed them one
[1:18:11] group of boys and then the door keeper
[1:18:14] recognized you by the chart that he had
[1:18:15] in his hand and then you're ready for
[1:18:18] the foot wash flunky then you go in you
[1:18:20] set your foot up he pulls off the sandal
[1:18:23] sets it up to a place so he'll know
[1:18:25] where you're at and on this other side
[1:18:27] he has a little shoe
[1:18:29] and actually gets through washing your
[1:18:31] feet washing it all off real good all
[1:18:33] the dust and everything make you fresh
[1:18:35] then he puts on this little cloth uh a
[1:18:38] shoe that goes over like you see in
[1:18:41] airplanes and crossing over overseas now
[1:18:43] they give them to you at night when you
[1:18:45] like uh the women have those little
[1:18:47] things they wear when they're not
[1:18:49] wearing stockings i see my wife and
[1:18:51] daughter and him getting some time they
[1:18:53] it's a little i like i don't know what
[1:18:55] they call them but it's just like a
[1:18:57] bottom part of a sock you know and and
[1:18:59] you put it on your foot there's
[1:19:00] something on that order it's a little
[1:19:01] higher because you don't want to take
[1:19:04] your old dirty sandal and walk over them
[1:19:06] rugs in there so then your feet's washed
[1:19:10] then you got the next thing takes place
[1:19:12] you got this little booty on i'll call
[1:19:14] it
[1:19:15] and then the next thing takes place
[1:19:17] there's a man standing there with a
[1:19:18] towel over his shoulder
[1:19:21] and he's got some ointment in his hands
[1:19:23] and that's a perfumed oil
[1:19:26] now the direct rays of that palestinian
[1:19:29] sun upon your neck is just blistering
[1:19:32] and another thing that dustin picks up
[1:19:35] sometimes get into their beard and in
[1:19:37] their hair
[1:19:39] and this man stands here then with
[1:19:41] ointment and he holds it out in this
[1:19:43] little pan you get on your hands and rub
[1:19:45] it in your face and over your neck then
[1:19:47] you take this towel and wipe it off
[1:19:50] groom your hair
[1:19:51] now sometimes this is very rare
[1:19:54] because it really gives a wonderful odor
[1:19:58] they get it many times from way high in
[1:20:00] the mountains on a wild rose bush you've
[1:20:03] seen the rules at the pedal drops off
[1:20:05] and it gets a little a little apple-like
[1:20:07] on it and out of there they crush it and
[1:20:10] get this perfume it's said that the
[1:20:12] queen of sheba when she come to solomon
[1:20:15] brought much of this fine perfume of
[1:20:17] that and give it to solomon very rare so
[1:20:20] hard to get into the mountains
[1:20:22] and then when they wipe this their beard
[1:20:24] and cross their necks and with this
[1:20:26] towel groom themselves now they're ready
[1:20:30] to meet the hoax to meet the one that
[1:20:32] invited them
[1:20:33] see they wouldn't feel right to go with
[1:20:35] all that dirt that's why feet washing
[1:20:37] see they
[1:20:38] they were smelling bad
[1:20:40] and they had to have their feet washed
[1:20:41] and with their big old heavy sandals on
[1:20:43] them fine rugs they wouldn't feel right
[1:20:46] to feel embarrassed but now his feet's
[1:20:48] washed now he's all groomed he smells
[1:20:52] with the perfume that's on him from this
[1:20:54] ointment what they call anointing their
[1:20:57] heads with oil and rubbed it on their
[1:20:59] face then wiped it with a towel now he's
[1:21:02] freshed up now the next thing he does he
[1:21:05] meets his horse the one that invited him
[1:21:07] he feels like meeting him now he
[1:21:09] wouldn't feel like meeting with all that
[1:21:10] dirt on him so he's all groomed up and
[1:21:13] ready now then the host meets him at the
[1:21:15] door and they have a very odd way
[1:21:19] and uh it's still uh in some of the
[1:21:21] churches
[1:21:22] a greeting with a kiss
[1:21:25] so they take a hand cross this way
[1:21:28] embrace one another man
[1:21:31] with with their arms around each other
[1:21:33] like this and kiss each other on the
[1:21:35] neck
[1:21:36] and when the horse kisses you
[1:21:38] you are welcome
[1:21:41] that's the welcome kiss now you wouldn't
[1:21:43] want your horse to kiss you with all
[1:21:44] that old dirt and stuff on on you so you
[1:21:47] had to be cleaned up before you're
[1:21:50] kissed welcome but oh
[1:21:52] one once you're kissed welcome you are a
[1:21:55] full-fledged brother that's all you
[1:21:57] could today the only thing you can do
[1:21:59] like today you're going a house and you
[1:22:01] feel at home you're one of them he's
[1:22:04] kissed you welcome you remember judas
[1:22:06] kissing jesus
[1:22:08] hypocritically see because if he kissed
[1:22:10] him it was a welcome it was a friend
[1:22:13] kiss
[1:22:14] not in the lips but on the neck
[1:22:16] kissed him on the neck
[1:22:18] now we noticed saying that you could go
[1:22:21] in if you want to go to the refrigerator
[1:22:23] it would be today and get you a great
[1:22:25] big sandwich and lay across the bed and
[1:22:26] eat it just make yourself at home
[1:22:28] you're welcome come in that's your all
[1:22:31] right now you just feel one of the
[1:22:32] family now because you're on the inside
[1:22:36] now
[1:22:37] you get all this done and anointed
[1:22:39] and uh all fixed up you're kissed
[1:22:42] welcome and then you go in shake hands
[1:22:44] at the banquet you meet your friends the
[1:22:46] host of done kissed you in and so you're
[1:22:48] you're free now you just feel like
[1:22:50] you're one of them you've been invited
[1:22:52] you've been clean you've been kissed
[1:22:54] welcome and now you're what i'm going to
[1:22:56] have your fellowship
[1:22:57] now
[1:22:58] about this time i'd imagine that rose
[1:23:01] lamb out there and the barbecue pit in
[1:23:04] the back was just smelling all around
[1:23:06] over the country with them grapes and
[1:23:08] things you'd imagine the poor people
[1:23:10] standing around the fence their mouth
[1:23:12] water they wasn't invited in just the
[1:23:14] celebrity to this so the the feast was
[1:23:17] now getting in pretty good sway
[1:23:19] everything is getting along fine
[1:23:23] for good sway
[1:23:25] now
[1:23:26] i'd imagine pharisee and his all of his
[1:23:30] friends is tipping the glass one to
[1:23:32] another and taking a good healthy drink
[1:23:34] of the very best wines there was in
[1:23:36] palestine at the time because they were
[1:23:38] rich
[1:23:40] they could afford it and they everybody
[1:23:42] the women they're fine jeweled women was
[1:23:45] over in a corner having their fellowship
[1:23:47] sitting around on the vans and so forth
[1:23:50] as a custom was in that day and the man
[1:23:52] all up having their toast and talking
[1:23:54] and the priests and all the rabbis
[1:23:56] everything having a great time
[1:23:59] and the the feast is getting pretty well
[1:24:02] uh
[1:24:03] on the way
[1:24:05] and then jesus
[1:24:08] although busy as he was in his busy
[1:24:10] schedule
[1:24:11] he always keeps his appointment
[1:24:15] you can depend on that
[1:24:18] he keeps his appointment
[1:24:22] now
[1:24:23] let's look into the room
[1:24:26] and see what's going on
[1:24:28] i can see pharisee over there tipping
[1:24:30] his glass and saying rabbi you know what
[1:24:33] and the great conversation going on the
[1:24:35] businessman talking of their business
[1:24:37] and everything the bank and some
[1:24:39] banquets in full swing now this great
[1:24:41] feast
[1:24:43] look sitting over against the wall
[1:24:47] not being noticed
[1:24:49] because jesus
[1:24:51] he kept his appointment he come
[1:24:54] he always keeps his word all his
[1:24:56] promises he fulfills
[1:25:00] but lord see he's sitting over there
[1:25:04] dirty
[1:25:05] i hate to say that it kills me to say it
[1:25:08] but his feet was dirty
[1:25:11] he had been anointed
[1:25:14] he hadn't been kissed welcome
[1:25:16] though he was invited
[1:25:18] that's like some of our modern revivals
[1:25:25] the frenchman calls him jesus
[1:25:29] jesus with dirty feet
[1:25:32] could you imagine it
[1:25:36] he was invited and he come
[1:25:40] and there he is it got in some way
[1:25:43] and unnoticed he sets over as a wall
[1:25:46] flower
[1:25:48] he was just as much out of place there
[1:25:50] he is in some of our modern revivals
[1:25:54] banquets so-called religious gatherings
[1:25:59] he was out of place
[1:26:01] nobody is paying any attention to me
[1:26:05] they were too busy with other things
[1:26:07] although he was invited
[1:26:11] but he wasn't welcome when he come
[1:26:15] what happened to that foot wash flunky
[1:26:19] how did he ever miss that opportunity
[1:26:22] yeah
[1:26:24] i wish i would have had his opportunity
[1:26:26] oh my god
[1:26:28] if i knew he'd been coming out i've been
[1:26:29] standing there waiting for him
[1:26:31] i'd
[1:26:32] have
[1:26:33] been ready for it
[1:26:35] how did he do it
[1:26:38] now let's not condemn him too much
[1:26:40] because we might do the same thing and
[1:26:41] not know it
[1:26:45] he missed him
[1:26:47] oh my
[1:26:52] notice he comes today to our
[1:26:54] callings too
[1:26:57] he comes in our midst
[1:27:02] i don't want to say this
[1:27:04] but i must say it
[1:27:07] and in our midst he's understood among
[1:27:09] us sitting there just as dirty to the
[1:27:11] people as he was saying
[1:27:14] it's exactly right call them holy
[1:27:15] rollers and everything else and yet we
[1:27:18] cry for a revival
[1:27:21] and he comes and when he does come we
[1:27:24] treat him about like they did then
[1:27:28] somebody raised up in the spirit of god
[1:27:31] holler a man or scream or something like
[1:27:33] that when jesus happens to pass by
[1:27:36] why the they put out a church
[1:27:41] well they think that's an awful shame to
[1:27:44] disgrace the church
[1:27:46] disgrace to people when it's jesus
[1:27:49] himself passing by
[1:27:52] and we can see him come and identify his
[1:27:54] word and do just like he did then and
[1:27:56] today they sense fortune telling mental
[1:27:59] telepathy
[1:28:00] or some evil spirit before the people is
[1:28:03] just as dirty as he was sitting there
[1:28:06] jesus the word of god
[1:28:10] and we do nothing about it
[1:28:12] we're too interested in our organization
[1:28:15] or our our social standing
[1:28:18] we're ashamed to be called by his name
[1:28:22] we're actually ashamed of him
[1:28:25] they was ashamed of him because he was
[1:28:28] dirty
[1:28:30] the guests didn't know him
[1:28:32] and they was ashamed of him because he's
[1:28:34] dirty
[1:28:35] that's the way it is today
[1:28:37] they're still ashamed of him because
[1:28:39] they pile the dirt that they can upon
[1:28:43] call it holy rollers and everything else
[1:28:45] that they can think of
[1:28:47] nobody does nothing about it
[1:28:51] there he says
[1:28:53] dirty feet
[1:28:54] wallflower at the party
[1:28:56] wallflower in a religious meeting
[1:29:00] invited
[1:29:03] we asked him to come for revival when he
[1:29:06] comes we treat him the same way they did
[1:29:07] there
[1:29:09] he come and identify himself
[1:29:11] but nobody wants nothing to do with him
[1:29:14] if he can pull some kind of a gimmick or
[1:29:17] or or do some kind of a miracle like he
[1:29:19] did before pilate pilot his only
[1:29:21] opportunity he ever had and he asked
[1:29:23] he'd want to see something done
[1:29:26] i wonder if let's see some sign
[1:29:28] he ought to repent
[1:29:31] that's what this cruel
[1:29:33] hell-bound world ought to do tonight's
[1:29:36] repent of their sins that's what these
[1:29:38] church members ought to do repent of
[1:29:40] their unbelief
[1:29:43] stand up for him
[1:29:45] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:47] forever
[1:29:49] and he identifies himself just like he
[1:29:52] did then and the people today take the
[1:29:53] same attitude that pharisee took
[1:29:57] same kind of an attitude
[1:30:00] let him settle
[1:30:01] after inviting him yet they don't want
[1:30:03] him
[1:30:04] they just do it like for manners
[1:30:06] he knows it
[1:30:09] we done to him today just like they did
[1:30:11] then
[1:30:14] instead of washing him
[1:30:17] washing his the reproach away instead of
[1:30:20] trying to stand up
[1:30:21] saying you're mistaken it's the word of
[1:30:23] god made manifest it's what he promised
[1:30:26] he said he poured out the spirit in the
[1:30:27] last days we're living in the last days
[1:30:29] instead of that we just kind of set back
[1:30:32] like they did
[1:30:34] we're afraid to take a stand
[1:30:37] why the i'm gonna raise up and say
[1:30:38] that's jesus of nazareth i believe he's
[1:30:41] a prophet of god
[1:30:42] you know the reason they didn't do it
[1:30:44] because they didn't believe he was a
[1:30:46] prophet
[1:30:47] and they still don't today
[1:30:50] they think he's an educator
[1:30:52] they think he's a denomination
[1:30:55] they don't know he's still a prophet
[1:30:57] that's what they're heading down there
[1:30:58] for in question
[1:31:02] that's the same thing as in question
[1:31:04] about today
[1:31:06] nobody's ready to take up for him they
[1:31:07] just say well you got nothing to do with
[1:31:09] him
[1:31:10] i belong to church there's my pastors
[1:31:11] all of them sitting around here i'm a
[1:31:12] good person and jesus
[1:31:15] with dirty feet
[1:31:17] nobody cared
[1:31:19] the very bible
[1:31:21] now we walk up and shake hands put our
[1:31:23] name on the book the methodist and they
[1:31:25] don't want us we're taking towards the
[1:31:26] baptist they kick this out we go to
[1:31:27] nazarenes
[1:31:29] the one that's kicked us out we go up to
[1:31:30] two and this the two of us kick us out
[1:31:31] we go to threeinus
[1:31:33] we don't have to put up with none of it
[1:31:35] all starchy
[1:31:38] that's it's the same way we and when
[1:31:40] jesus comes
[1:31:41] amen we don't even recognize we don't
[1:31:44] care
[1:31:45] that's right that's the way they do and
[1:31:47] yet we're crying come lord jesus come
[1:31:49] lord jesus and he comes
[1:31:53] and what do we do
[1:31:54] same thing they did
[1:31:56] why if they say anything except it
[1:31:59] somebody else will here make fun of them
[1:32:01] and they let him set dirty
[1:32:05] it's called an evil spirit
[1:32:08] you remember jesus told him one day
[1:32:10] when they said this man does this by
[1:32:12] beelzebub he said you say that against
[1:32:14] me to be forgiven but someday the holy
[1:32:16] ghost will come to do the same thing and
[1:32:17] one word against it will never be
[1:32:19] forgiven
[1:32:23] there we are
[1:32:25] jesus
[1:32:26] with dirty feet
[1:32:27] could you imagine it
[1:32:29] could you imagine people who claim to
[1:32:32] love god
[1:32:33] and it got so mixed up in their creeds
[1:32:36] and their denominations and isms jesus
[1:32:39] said your traditions you've made the
[1:32:40] word of god of no effect
[1:32:42] there he was there and the word was in
[1:32:45] effect
[1:32:46] because it was made flesh
[1:32:48] and was proven exactly that he was the
[1:32:51] christ
[1:32:52] and the people with their traditions
[1:32:54] wouldn't let it be effective upon the
[1:32:56] other people that's what he was doing
[1:32:58] trying to show it off if
[1:33:00] see they didn't believe he was a prophet
[1:33:03] and yet the bible said he would be a
[1:33:04] prophet
[1:33:07] the bible moses said the lord your god
[1:33:09] shall raise up a prophecy around the 18
[1:33:11] 15.
[1:33:12] and the bible predicted just exactly
[1:33:14] what he was doing here he come doing it
[1:33:16] among those people
[1:33:19] and today we leave him with just his
[1:33:20] dirty name as he had then
[1:33:23] let him say things against it in the
[1:33:25] days of miracles just pastors though
[1:33:27] such a thing when the bible said he's
[1:33:28] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:33:31] and we're still ashamed to stand out and
[1:33:33] say something about it
[1:33:37] we're ashamed of our testimony that we
[1:33:39] we claim we believe
[1:33:42] instead of washing him
[1:33:44] trying to wash him with tears of joy
[1:33:46] that he's here we just let him sit dirty
[1:33:50] i won't have not do it i cooperate
[1:33:52] nothing like that put my hand on it
[1:33:55] there you are
[1:33:56] it's the same bunch of pharisees
[1:34:01] just under another knee
[1:34:04] we again let him set like that for the
[1:34:06] same reason we don't believe he's a
[1:34:08] prophet we're ashamed of it
[1:34:11] why the same reason we don't believe it
[1:34:14] the people don't know sir he can come do
[1:34:15] whatever he wishes to they're setting
[1:34:18] their ways and there's nobody trying to
[1:34:19] fool with him and you know the bible
[1:34:20] said they'd be that way
[1:34:22] exactly the bible said they'd be that
[1:34:24] way
[1:34:25] lukewarm
[1:34:28] form of godliness to have no power
[1:34:30] thereof think that's right
[1:34:34] we join up with this educational
[1:34:35] polished up group standing there and
[1:34:37] having our big socials and times our
[1:34:39] fine churches and find decorations then
[1:34:42] jesus christ can come in and you let him
[1:34:43] stay dirty
[1:34:45] the word can be made manifest among us
[1:34:47] and we still walk around let people talk
[1:34:48] about it
[1:34:50] oh my god
[1:35:00] you know we
[1:35:02] we would look and say that's them that's
[1:35:04] other churches but let's look at
[1:35:06] ourselves
[1:35:08] he's jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:35:10] today and forever
[1:35:12] and he keeps all his appointments

[1:40:49] and um
[1:40:52] i um
[1:40:53] me and brother arne sister rachel my
[1:40:55] wife and brother nathan had gone out
[1:40:57] sunday evening and
[1:40:59] brother arne saw
[1:41:01] someone that he had known and
[1:41:03] brother john peterson so we asked and
[1:41:05] brother arne found out brother john
[1:41:07] passed away
[1:41:09] last week
[1:41:10] one week ago today so
[1:41:13] asking
[1:41:14] prayer for his brother fred and before
[1:41:16] his dan his son
[1:41:18] bruce
[1:41:20] and if you remember the testimony of
[1:41:21] brother
[1:41:22] john
[1:41:23] how he was going up the road one day and
[1:41:25] he saw a blind man
[1:41:27] out there with his cane so he stopped to
[1:41:29] give him a ride
[1:41:30] and he gets on the car and
[1:41:33] he tells a brother john about the lord
[1:41:35] jesus christ
[1:41:36] and he said that's what i do i stand out
[1:41:38] here and people pick me up and i witness
[1:41:40] to them
[1:41:41] about the lord jesus christ so
[1:41:44] this morning
[1:41:46] i got up the roof
[1:41:48] went outside around 6 30 this morning to
[1:41:50] leave to work
[1:41:52] and i didn't hear the
[1:41:54] fire trucks or anything come but they

[1:41:57] house fire truck ambulance police
[1:42:01] and i at first with all the police
[1:42:02] around i thought maybe there's some kind
[1:42:04] of something else that happened so
[1:42:07] i was starting to walk towards the
[1:42:09] police to find out what was going on
[1:42:11] when

[1:42:22] get in there but we told them we would
[1:42:24] pray for them
[1:42:25] and
[1:42:27] our neighbor paula and she's she's been
[1:42:29] a real kind neighbor to us
