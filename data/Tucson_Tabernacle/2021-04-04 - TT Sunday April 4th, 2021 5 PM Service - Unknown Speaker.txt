[Music] amen we sing that other song when the saints go marching in i want to be in that number when the saints go marching in amen that's the number i want to be in amen well this comes to our last meeting of our revival and the lord's revived me how many can say amen to that can you lift your hand and say god's done something in my life he's revived me amen turned a lot of things upside down in our life and that's a good thing amen get all the trash out of our life get our prayer life right get our attitude right some of us need just a little attitude adjustment amen god's made some changes i know in a lot of things amen i would just want to say thank you for your support coming to the meetings and support and be so attentive and amen the brothers and sisters in each one your singing your attendance may god bless you and i want to thank all the people that did all the work to make this possible i know brother jordan said he had 32 hours in this week amen just getting ready trying to stay up with me i feel bad sometimes i feel like i'm wearing everybody out but hey man i appreciate our musicians i wonder if we could give them a handclap amen and all the singers everybody that sing sang and all that they did and appreciate william flying out here to be with us in the meeting and he's my son by the way somebody asked me about that said dude i said no that's william my son i appreciate my brother john he's my little brother hey man i appreciate john hey man brother john sister sharon she's a wonderful person if you haven't got to shake sister sharon's hand shake her hand she's a saint we call her saint sharon amen she's a wonderful person now the catholics believe you have to die to be a saint but we find out in the book of ephesians paul wrote and said to the saints that are at ephesus so they had to be alive and they had to be able to read his letter so we believe saints can be alive so it's not bad it means a sanctified one right so we ought to be able to look at everybody in the holy ghost field church and say saint sean saint noah saint jeremy right if somebody leaves the saint off you're like lord am i not sanctified may the lord help us amen we've got one more service let's just put our all into it let's just pull on the word of god don't get lazy and sit back amen just pull on the word of god and amen let's say amen to the word and tree the devil this is our last service maybe the last service we ever have the privilege to be in i know in canada brother john amen come closer brother up in canada they opened the service up and allowed them to have one service in canada they started i think breaking the names up in the church and who could come and who couldn't they had one service then they had a lady official i don't know if it's over the whole country the providence come in and shut the whole thing down done with all the churches and restaurants and all of that so we don't know what could a year ago people have oh that won't happen in america and then all of a sudden it turns and they're telling you when you can have church and when you can't have church if you're going to wear something on your face or not wear something on your face and you know and they were we lived in indiana and across the river was kentucky and the governors had opposing ideas so the laws were all completely different from one just driving across the river and so i said look just tell me if i got to wear a mask or not wear a mask or sit six feet apart or what i got to do i don't you know i'll do the whatever but they were confused amen but i know that the lord is with us can you say amen some of us got sick but the lord is our healer amen i don't know what tomorrow holds but whatever i go through tomorrow as long as he's with me amen amen he said i paul said i can do all things through christ who strengthens me jesus said lo i am with you always so whatever it is that he's got us to go through it might be a fiery furnace might be a den of lions it might be through the red sea whatever it is as long as he's with us i feel okay about that now if you've got sin in your life he's not with you that little dove's taking flight then you're just kind of on your own with like the disciples out there with no pilot just amen but they cried they said lord save us lord help us and that's the thing say lord forgive me it's just he's just a breath away i know the one brother preached the sermon said he said miss in heaven by 18 inches have it all in your head but don't have anything in your heart you miss miss heaven by 18 inches and go to a devil's hell we don't want to just have it all in our brain we want it to drop down in our hearts say lord cleanse my heart amen make me new amen do we know that song changed my heart oh god amen do we know that one amen brother his brother jordan's got something to say god i i've neglected to make an announcement for the local assembly here the deacons reminded me when i walked off brother julio figaro's memorial service will be this saturday at 12 o'clock i believe i was told 12 30 one point but my understanding when i talked to the family this afternoon at noon on saturday for brother julio i neglected to mention that we'll probably make another announcement on what's happened i just want to let the congregation know you're all invited lord bless you amen thank you brother brother jordan praise the lord let's pull on the word of god as if it's our last service amen let's sing this little song change my heart oh god make it your prayer make it ever true it's more than a song change my heart [Music] let's sing that again can you just lift your hands to the lord change my heart change my heart make it ever true [Music] i am [Music] change amen that's our desire tonight isn't it amen welcome to your sunday evening service hallelujah we've had friday sunday was coming we had saturday sunday was coming we've arrived hallelujah glory to god sunday morning it's been a long day today it's sunday afternoon so tonight we're going to travel back to sunday afternoon what was happening 2000 years ago maybe it's been a long day for you it's easter a lot of took their easter lunches today with their families they're not here tonight and that's you know family time is important it's very do we believe that so we're going to have some family time thank you musicians can you just have your seats for a moment brother murray is brother elijah doing is he strong enough to come and see me brother elijah come up here just let him walk up here brother brother elijah come up here and see brother john let's give brother elijah a round of applause hallelujah hallelujah can you come up here my goodness glory to god let me just hold you okay amen now if i understand this right the doctors the doctors didn't give this little boy hardly a chance to be normal is that right brother murray and here he is this weekend he has sang with the choir every time and i just wanted to give glory to god jesus loves the little children there was a time in the bible there was a time in the bible elijah when all the adults wanted to find out about marriage and divorce and a lot of deep things like that and jesus took up a little child in his arms and said unless we become like one of these we're not going to enter in amen sometimes we grow up and we get too old and we forget about little boys like elijah that the world gave up on but jesus didn't so elijah we love you and thank you for singing to us this weekend let's give him another round of applause god bless you brother amen brother elijah you can go back to your daddy go back to your daddy back there amen and he jumps good too amen i think that's important for us to to recognize our little children and especially those that might be needy among us or seem small i also wanted to make note of brother perry green how many know that it was brother perry green that started up the phone hookup who knows that back in the 60s we would have called it like modern connection it was something that wasn't very popular is that right brother and brother perry greene a younger man in the message a younger minister but he wanted to let that voice go to as many people that desire to be connected and i just looked in the back study all the way back into the 60s and you know right up through the late 65s there it was brother perry green that had that kind of a vision today we'd say well the internet's horrible and it's evil and all of that but i still believe there's the voice of the bride that there's others that deserve to be connected and i think what happened right in this building of tucson tabernacle has just continued on it's a bride's revival but i wanted to remind you that your previous pastor brother perry was on the cutting edge and uh of technology he just wanted to make that available and i thank god for that amen sister laurie and sister melissa wasn't that a wonderful song i think brother jordan um called uh her auntie and cousin i'll just call her like my mother and my sister we go way back to the into the 90s and back in phoenix we knew them the snow family from way back in the 90s and shared some years together in phoenix and then and then in cloverdale and in washington state here we are again tonight and we just thank the lord for that you know we're having our easter afternoon dinner today and i'm so thankful for that well i promise you tonight i'm not going to be long and we're just relaxed and i'm going to let you go a little earlier we have a baptism tonight brother joseph is going to be baptized and so we just want to give time for that you know there's one thing about having the service at five and sometimes you leave the morning you go eat and then you rush back everybody's just kind of ate and all our food's kind of settling down so let's let's just be strong and finish strong can we agree if i promise you i'll be short you promise me that you'll just stick it out there and on the edge of your seat amen it was a it was on a sunday night of easter that uh some believers were walking down a road and all of a sudden someone appeared out of the shadows and by the time they got done with that little walk their eyes were open and what took a few miles of a walk they ran back to jerusalem maybe tonight you feel a little sluggish or it's been a long weekend and it's been a little bit you're tired but maybe by the end of tonight you can just say god you as we heard your word my heart was burning within me so let's turn to that scripture as we stand together luke chapter 24. i wanted to thank the trustees of tucson tabernacle and the elders that allowed my wife and i to come this weekend and also for the room that you provided and the meals that you've provided and so we haven't had a lot of time to be able to see you because we've just been preparing but after the service and when our little fellowship there's a little fellowship tonight right everyone invited maybe we'll get to say hi to some of you tonight luke chapter 24 i'm just looking at my time but before we read this scripture let's just bow our heads and pray our dear heavenly father lord you're made known in the opening of your word sometimes it may be loud sometimes it might be quiet but lord still waters run deep and i pray on this sunday night father on easter sunday night that you would step out of the shadows step out of the shadows of the scripture step out of the shadows of just this evening time it's almost six o'clock but i pray father the same lord jesus that revealed yourself two thousand years ago would come into this building of tucson tabernacle and just make yourself known to us tonight we acknowledge your greatness in simplicity tonight open our lives and give us strength in jesus name amen luke 24 verse 1 to 12 is again the resurrection of jesus christ this happened on sunday morning and our title tonight is our easter has arrived so when we look at um luke 24 verse 1 to 12 that is the resurrection of the lord jesus and verse 10 verse 10 talks about mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and the other women so there was quite a few of the sisters that were first to the tomb now let's look in verse 13 as we come into easter afternoon this is sunday and behold two of them went that same day luke 24 13 to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs i believe that's about six miles is that right i think it's about six miles and they talk together of all these things which had happened on friday and on saturday and now they hadn't heard that jesus they didn't know where jesus was it's and here it is the afternoon time but they were talking about it and it came to pass that while they communed together and reason jesus let's all say jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto them art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priest and our elders delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him here they're talking about the man that had just went through all of this and we trusted we had hoped we had believed that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself they weren't bored they weren't confu they but as god begin to talk to them jesus their hearts begin to burn and i pray tonight just for the next few minutes that while we're sitting at tucson tabernacle that the lord jesus would step out of the shadows and may our hearts start burning within us god bless you you can have your seats tonight just keep your bibles open because i had you seated because we just finished half of their walk just their half of their walk from toward emmaus but i want to speak tonight on our easter has arrived we talked friday about how what jesus went through and the crucifixion and things we spoke about saturday and how it was dark and how we just don't understand what is happening and then now sunday morning and i'm so thankful we heard the message this morning on the surge the surge at easter wasn't that wonderful just to know the holy ghost the spirit raising jesus from the dead what a resurrection that was but to not look back 2 000 years ago and try to make a drama and a hollywood passion about it and and not just to focus on history but to be able to know that right now what god is doing in our hearts now what a resurrection this is hello tucson tabernacle don't don't miss what god is doing some are missing what god is doing and jesus is walking with us and they don't even know it they don't even know that jesus is doing these things and i'm glad that we didn't stop in verse 27 because a lot of us have heard about moses and all the prophets and you can put that up brothers luke 24 verse 27 how the beginning of moses and all the prophets let me ask you tonight who would have liked to have taken this walk with jesus i mean we don't understand we don't understand how it could be like this what happened friday what happened saturday and then you know we've heard some of our sisters have told us remember it was the sisters that that saw the empty tomb first it was a lady in the church that actually heard the voice of jesus in the garden mary mary and you know she she believed it was joanna it was some of the maybe it was a musician maybe it was one of the sisters their heart was so happy he has risen and the brothers didn't believe it at first some of us are slow of heart now we're walking down a road and we're sad we've heard about all this but we haven't seen jesus ourselves it's like a story it's like uh it's like a dream it's like we've heard about all these things but now someone is talking to us about the word of god and something's happening in our hearts that's more than a story verse 28. if you have your bibles it would be good to just follow along the brothers are putting it on the screen but if you follow as they were talking and walking these six miles my they got some good exercise that day i didn't get my afternoon walk today as they were getting in some exercise and walking with jesus down the road they drew nigh to a village with her they went and he made as though he would just keep on going further jesus had brought him through these great times in this moment of resurrection talking now about the scriptures and talking about their day and but he made like he was just going to keep on going and maybe that's where tucson tabernacle is tonight maybe god has done great things among us and talked to us along the road and it makes it look like he's just gonna go on his way but verse 29 says they constrained him that means with strong desire they loved what they had been hearing what had been happening as he talked to them along the road they constrained him maybe they grabbed a hold of him and said we don't want you to leave us would you come with us to our emmaus meal come and have some more fellowship we want to spend some more time with you jesus i want you jesus i love this presence i love this atmosphere i loved how he just talked to us wasn't that so good it made it come alive it wasn't like the scribes and pharisees and and you know we weren't bored at all it was just like those minutes went by so fast but my it made it so real to us our hearts are burning and and then he made it like he was just gonna go and they said no we want more of this i hope there's some here tonight that are like that abide with us for it is toward evening it's sunday how many know this is sunday in the bible the the evening after the resurrection and here we find ourselves in april 2021 on the evening time of easter the same time i just think it'd be amazing if the same lord jesus that did it for them would do it for somebody in this building maybe tonight's crowd is the least of the whole weekend but god reveals himself to just a few maybe we're just enjoying the few that god can now focus down on your heart and your needs and it's not the sunday morning crowd and it's not the easter morning crowd it's just you tonight and us and just a few of us before we go have a little fellowship and god is just it wasn't planned that jesus meet these men cleopas and his friend hadn't made this appointment they're just walking along kind of kicking the pebbles brother aaron saying how can all this be and we don't understand and their countenance is falling they didn't see the nail scarred hands they didn't know that this man that was walking with them was jesus they just thought it was another man but something was happening to them and they constrained him it was toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with him and it came to pass brother jeremy as he sat at meet with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave to them something was happening beyond a man breaking bread and having fellowship and let's have a meal their eyes were open verse 31 and their eyes came open they said there's only one man that can do that and that is jesus hello believers of the message surely this far down the road there's only one man that can open our hearts like that and that is jesus when he had done something that was familiar to them the same voice that had called them from a little girl sister laurie the same god that called you as a little boy when you didn't understand the same one that broke it to your heart when you first gave your heart their eyes come open it was the same jesus but their eyes come open and they knew him what does the bible say that next he vanished out of their sight he's in a new body that's why he told mary don't touch me yet i've not ascended yet to my father but now he's coming and he's in a new body he just he he can walk through a wall he can appear in another city which we're going to find out he did it's the same quickening power that was on jesus was on philippine and the book of acts that in a great revival in samaria god calls him to go baptize one one colored brother one man that was writing in a chariot and reading the bible of isaiah but he didn't understand and all of a sudden there's a man walking on the road that had just come from a massive message revival demon spirits cast out and hundreds of people in it and then now he's just walking along a road and there comes a chariot it was for one it was just for one hello tucson tabernacle god will leave the thousands for you tonight and by the end of that story they're walking out in the water he's getting baptized the colored brother he rises him up out of the water and philip disappears speaking bible right now and he appears in another city that's between 150 and 200 miles away he was translated and brother branham said he never went back to samaria again he didn't go back to the revival he didn't go back to those believers that had given their heart to the lord and been filled with the holy ghost and he didn't go back but god had another plan he had another vision friends who would like to get translated just caught up and just forget about everything of work and my boss and the school and the money and the politicians and the virus hallelujah just get caught away and now jesus now we're coming back to our scripture he just vanishes out of their sight wow did you see that brother did you see that and one might have said i knew it was him all the time no you didn't y'all know what i'm talking about somebody say something it's kind of a riddle a riddle a riddle and oh we don't know tell us the answer and you say i knew it it was on the tip of my tongue and cleopa says no you didn't i got some of you to smile amen now watch this they had just been breaking bread and having some fellowship with a person and just when he began to speak to them and break the bread their eyes come open that's jesus oh jesus but he disappeared it's sunday night we talked about friday we talked about saturday all of us were looking forward to sunday morning now this is right in line sister melissa with your song because a lot of believers and a lot of churches and a lot of ministers they really look forward to easter sunday morning is this the morning is the resurrection going to happen is sunday morning the red what my the greatest day of the whole year you would think that would be the day for the great resurrection but it didn't happen like that this morning now we're already in the afternoon i'm not talking 2 000 years ago i'm talking about tonight easter has just kept moving god must have something for us down the road so the general resurrection didn't happen this morning i'm talking about tonight you all understand so there must be a work for us to do there must be a work for us to do down the road 2 000 years ago the resurrection took place but i'm talking this morning april the 4th the resurrected saints didn't come walking into tucson tabernacle and that surge oh my that's so and so and that so and so we're still here in fact we're fewer in number there's more room for the angels to be social distance all the social distancing angels that if the lord would open our eyes i tell you what brother jordan if there was already a sudden be a light over and just come down and go back to brother arnie and just kind of the pillar of fire just like amber back there and brother brother jordan looked back and saw his father just his face aglow and there was like a pillar of fire over his he'd probably grab his little cell phone and take that photo and i wouldn't mind just sharing it with this that'd be incredible if all of a sudden angel started appearing on your pew and you looked down looked down and there was an angel sitting there just pulsating with light and pulsating and god opens your eyes to the angels that are in this service you'd get excited too and don't tell me you wouldn't we all would but i believe the the pillar of fire is in this building right now i believe the angel of the lord is in this building right now i believe he's here the holy ghost is here jesus is here part of the bride of christ is sitting right in this building right now some of you brothers have been faithful years keeping the standard and holding the church together and being faithful you've taken care of the bride you've kept the standard god's going to honor that god's going to honor that verse 32 and they said one to another did not our heart burn this is cleopas and his friend did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way while he scriptures it was like the scriptures came alive it's like what brother branham said in entombment and that's what brother john was quoting out of yesterday if you want to know where we got that inspiration and just the word we're talking about what jesus was doing on saturday morning saturday night it's in the message i was listening to it on friday and on saturday this morning and my wife can tell you i was listening to the next sunday morning of the mighty conqueror then sunday night of the same weekend brother branham spoke a message and their eyes were open so literally what you've heard this weekend is just the message it's quotes of brother branham i might not have been saying brother but i'm saying brother but i'm saying but i but i was speaking to you the message some of your children and some of your young people their hearts were burning within them as he opened to us verse 33 and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together remember judas went out and hung himself so the twelve disciples became eleven and they were gathered together in them that were with them saying the lord is risen indeed hallelujah and hath appeared to simon that was simon peter and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread how many would like to see that more and more in your life in your devotion in the hearing just the lord's making himself known he was made known to them in the opening of the word in the breaking of the bread the same lord jesus is making himself known to the elect bride today our easter has arrived so where do we go from here it's going to be easter now and some of us are flying away monday some are leaving you on tuesday you are maybe going back to work or school and we see from the emmaus road cleopas and his friend and all the things that happen remember it wasn't just jesus that uh resurrected on sunday morning the bible says that the graves were open and the old testament believers were walking around and were seen of many how many believe the bible so it's not just jesus walking around it's the saints of old we're walking around jerusalem and that's a good question when did they go up to heaven when did those believers go up to heaven that's a good question well it's right in the message too i was listening to brother branham this morning he took he said they went up when jesus went up 40 days later so they were walking around jerusalem for 40 days and when jesus ascended up into heaven that's when those others had and the bible says he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men that's the scripture brother branham used that those disciples of jesus from they ascended up also some of you didn't know that well it's time to get back in the message let's go to this western town just for a moment this western town i see is the buildings are along the side of the road and there's a horse carriage and in the horse carriage is a little baby boy and for some reason there's a shot in the western town a shot of a gun and it scared the horses that were carrying the carriage and they started running down the street toward the cliff toward a drop off because they had been spooked they had been scared by the gunshot and a young man saw all this happening and he ran out into the middle of the road and he stopped those horses just before it went over and saved the little baby boy years went by in this town and the story goes and it's not just a story it's the truth a young man took the wrong road and he got to drinking carousing and he actually shot a man and now they're in court and now he's before the judge and he's standing there this is the inspiration from this whole weekend i kept saying it's friday but sunday is coming it's saturday but tomorrow sunday where we're standing on sunday are we just all supposed to get confused and disillusioned and go back monday and be the same no years went by and this young man took the wrong road and murdered someone and he's standing in the court and the judge is there and he sentenced this man to death for murdering someone and that young man he broke the whole court procession and he jumped over the rail and he and he fell at the judge's feet and he said judge judge don't you recognize me don't you recognize me and the judge was a little bit uh just taken back by this huge outburst in his court he said no son no i i don't reckon don't you recognize me years ago when i was a little baby in a carriage with some horses and there was a gunshot that scared them they ran down the r and it was going toward a cliff and it was you judge when you were younger you stopped those horses and you saved my life and the young man has pleaded and he said judge judge you saved me then can't you save me now and the judge just kind of said he's just still shaking a little bit from the outburst and they but he made the statement and he said young man that day i was your savior but today i'm your judge that day i was your savior but today i'm your judge and brother bradham is the one that spoke this story he actually is the one that gave this illustration in a service and he's bringing the reality that today god is dealing in your life today god is your savior today you have grace today you have mercy today we're feeding from the resurrection but to reject our day of grace is to stand before the judge and hear the same words that day i was your savior but today i'm your judge and friends that's the reason of tucson tabernacle that's the reason it was even started back in 1965 and it still exists today in 2021 is that lives could be saved lives could be healed lives could hear the message declared over the pulpit and by that the new generation could rise up and their hearts could burn within them as they walk along the road and their eyes when they come open they see jesus we don't see a man we don't see just a family we don't just see the walls we we don't just see the fans turning in the rocks we're looking beyond that brother joseph beyond the water the water doesn't save brother joseph it's his confession of faith and now you tonight in a few minutes are going to see a dry a man that is dry go down into the water it's a type of the grave and come up and we don't want to see him go down down a dry center and come up a wet center it's a type that the water is like the grave you only put dead people in the grave somebody say man tonight we don't put live people in the graveyard and i don't think in tucson in your cemeteries you'd go by and see you know feet's hanging out and hands lifted out and skulls lifted out you put them totally under the water it's like our whole life we went under the water that we would rise in newness of life the same spirit that gave you old-timers and i'm middle-aged myself that joy and that thrill and the ecstasy of knowing jesus the new generation deserves to have that too we had our revival the older generation had our revival and brother bradham talked about this and spoken word is the original seed and other messages he said but the new generation deserves their chance at the word this is their time for their revival oh how our hearts burn within us when we heard the word is that true brothers and sisters you that are older know when the message came by your way it just was an excitement it was a joy you wanted to be there where god help us now in 2021 to allow the same jesus to step out of the shadows and make himself real in this generation that day i was your savior but today i'm your judge i don't want any person under the sound of our voice or ever has heard a message from this tabernacle to be standing that day and hear the judge our easter has arrived our time of the resurrection has arrived back in february i told you this already i brought the original piece of paper right here that god dealt with us in our office and home not knowing that we would be in tucson this weekend and i had written down in my notes token resurrection and the quickening power of rapture and rapturing quickening power and i've been studying that on the quickening power and how we've been elected for a resurrection but there was one quote of brother branham that i've kept here and i put it in my notes all the way from february can i share it tonight brother branham said it was easter morning i heard a chaplain from the first world war he said this right in arizona 1965 a chaplain from the first world war and the chaplain said he had to go down to the hospital said so many boys were laying in the tent and had just come from the outside and he went so he went in there and one of the officers said chaplin we want to ride out and take a look at the fields out there they had throwed he's talking about world war how they had thrown the mustard gas and the chlorine gas as they did in those days it just killed everything i said uh i got out there brother branham this is a chaplain's first-hand account i got out there that morning there wasn't bark on the tree there wasn't a sprig of grass and it was on easter morning he said there was some old wrecked tanks down there and the officer had to get a record of them to see if there was anything could be done for them this is near the argeon forest and he said i was standing there by myself and i i looked up and i said oh god here's a man looking out over a field there was no grass there was not even bark on the trees and he said oh god is this the way it's all coming to it was all burnt up no life nowhere at all just grass burn off the tree that gases the trees were killed everything was killed twisted hanging down where bulletin thing had riddled it and brother branham was applying that to the spiritual condition of the church are you listening i know it's friday evening i know many of you are weary but here's something that was already reserved for tonight back in february brother branham was looking out over the spiritual condition of the church how it had been riddled with gun shot and tanks were destroyed and no grass no bark on the trees which is a type of of the religion had been able to hold things together no the trees the bride tree he would say he said it's a picture of today where satan is spraying his unbelief and his hybriding of science and his knowledge until when it was at the beginning when god put adam and eve in the garden that beautiful paradise without death without sickness without sorrow everything was perfect in order look at what satan's ddt has done he's talking about look what satan's poison has done to this generation brother branham said she's in chaos there is nothing left in it and i think we could all agree this global pandemic has brought the world to its knees financially emotionally mentally just chaos and this man is looking out over this field and he's just started crying this chaplain just started crying and i walked back just started walking back to the tent but i was attracted to something that was there to a certain rock so i just went over there i just went over to this rock i was attracted to it i just went over there i looked at the rock and then i pushed it over and down beneath that rock was a little white flower growing the only living thing left because it had been sheltered by a rock he said god my rock shelter us today oh god when these poisons are flying everywhere in the name of science and education here's a prophet saying shelter us keep me until that day o god is my prayer i hope that we each one are under that rock which is christ hello believers tonight on easter evening god is getting our attention to what's under the rock stop looking at the death stop looking at the brokenness stop describing the ddt and the chaos and the poison and the numbers brother branham said it's science and education let god show you a revelation and as you look at the revelation as you ponder these things just go over there and start moving things around a little bit and under that rock brother jeremy was a white flower the only life in the whole field tucson tabernacle we need to look at the word we need to move around in the word let our hearts burn within us and see the white flower speaks of new life new growth the power of god moisture got down there but it had been the rock that had been sheltering it from all of this poison and all of the world friends all of you that make the rapture are gonna say thank god for the rock and this rock is jesus he's the only one i hope tonight as we leave these easter meetings that you'll start turning over the rocks in your life and looking for the rose looking for the white lily white flower just after tonight and you go home and then it's going to be they call it i think brother aaron easter monday because it's the monday after easter it's the time when many people they just okay we had a great crescendo and it was a wonderful time and it was a great surge and my the meetings and we were clapping we were rejoicing and we had three specials we had four specials and my it was incredible but you are gonna have your monday after the revival but i pray that we would all be able to say my easter has arrived christ that made himself known the sunday before on palm sunday when they were all shouting hosanna hosanna and by friday morning those same ones that were shouting hosanna hosanna were saying crucify him crucify him they had been so influenced by the religious spirit of the city i hope you're listening they were so influenced by the division in the city that they one sunday they loved him by the next friday morning they wanted to destroy his character they wanted to speak negative things that were twisted about the messiah about the word that was being made flesh and was so evident right before them they nailed him to the cross oh you say brother john those scribes and pharisees didn't nail him to the cross well they said his blood be upon us and on our children and for all of these years the jewish catch this tonight the jewish race their eyes has been blinded from the messiah but one day friends when the bride leaves this earth the same message that you have received is going to be revealed to the jewish people oh you ought to be excited right now and 144 000 are going to be saved you all know revelations 10 right christ coming down the earthly s messenger which was william branham now he's revelations 10 7 and and he's going to reveal the mysteries but what's revelations 11 it's moses and elijah they're coming back to the jews they're delivering a word the same jesus that you have crucified you crucified 2 000 years ago it's going to be a global thing they're going to kill moses and elijah publicly and when the bible says in revelations 11 that the world will gaze on this the only way the world will gaze on that all the news and all the major stations are going to be showing this globally while the bride is in another place thank you jesus i i'm just giving you a little bit of something that the message has made very clear the jewish people their eyes are blinded but one day their eyes are going to come open are you serious we killed the messiah so now as we close tonight as we come to the end of the service right before the baptism you that are familiar with a will or a trust you that have might know anything about life insurance or insurance car insurance or life insurance know that there's a beneficiary that you designate that if a man or a woman dies and i've got a million dollar life insurance policy by the death of that person then whoever you say is a beneficiary or would benefit from this million dollars i i promised you i was going to be short i'm going to be short some of you are shocked man i'm going to keep my part of the deal some of you are falling asleep man you got to keep your part of the deal amen do you know that the bride is the sole beneficiary of the rapture the bride is the only lady that at the death of the one the male that she would receive and the benefits of his death do you know that and on sunday morning he rose to seal the deal i died for you on friday you thought it was over saturday but i was really working behind the scene and now it's sunday here i am i'm giving you everything i'm giving you rapture i'm giving you healing i'm giving you joy i'm giving you peace i'm giving you revival i'm giving you a future home hallelujah some would say oh i want to go back to eden well somehow in eden that's when the fall happened so we're going back before that eden this bride won't fall we're going back to a place where the serpent and the devil is now under our feet hallelujah i give you eternal life i give you a future home you are beneficiaries of his generosity like it would be said in a trust or or in a insurance policy i give you certain amount of funds or property or benefits i give to you you friends we have been made heirs of all of these promises and you don't have to be weary and depressed and allow these spirits to walk all over your mind and your spirit and i don't know if i'll ever be invited back here to speak again but this morning i actually wrote a note brother arnie in my notes because after all of the ones that were coming for prayer last night i i realized we can say we're in the message all day long but we still have wounded ones among us we have wounded ones among us and we can spend all our services dealing with the soul realm getting people saved getting them filled with the holy ghost then we can have prayer lines and prayer meetings and we can go in that direction but there are individuals that have been neglected in their spirit realm and they sit right in our message pews and they are wounded and god raised up ministries that know how to deal in that realm brother branham did he talked about menopause he talked about nervousness i know we don't like to talk about those things publicly but a prophet did he talked about things that happened in a person's life and you're saved you have the holy ghost and he talked about that in masterpiece and and the sister that came to she was struggling and he went back in her life he went back in the life of one person and said it was a dog that was chasing you when you were a young girl i see you running from a dog another person fell down into a whale and it dislodged their insides friends we can try to cast out all demons and all that but it's going back into a person's life and having a gift and being able to deal with that thing it'll give our sisters victory give our brothers victory some of you that have lost loved ones or been abused or had sexual abuse in your family there's a word for that and i wrote right in my notes brother arnie wounded lives can still love they sit right in our message pews and they're just wounded they're hurt they've been broken but broken hearts can still love we are benefits we are beneficiaries of the resurrection hello everyone tonight this is easter and right before our musicians come they were walking down the road so sad at the start of the evening but by the end of the evening they were running back the messiah's alive he's appeared to us he broke bread to us we didn't even realize he called us fuel fools and slow of heart he rebuked us but we didn't get all nasty and throw him out we said you're true lord we should have known the promises they were embracing jesus whether it's in rebuke whether it's in correction or whether it's in encouragement or whatever it is we've heard the voice of god we are beneficiaries of it this week it would be horrible if tomorrow morning we went right back to the same rut the same unbelief we woke up with that depression and we just started feeding that spirit of fear no it's time to stand up and say our easter we have arrived let's stand to our feet tonight it is the rising of the sun the seal has been broken the easter seal has been broken and on a sunday night here in tucson arizona we're a free people how many is thankful for the lord jesus all the don't leave it 2 000 years ago on a

gospel hallelujah let's lift up those hands that were weary holding down lift them up and say thank you jesus heavenly fathers we bow our heads tonight on sunday evening easter sunday night it's a lot like that sunday night two thousand years ago many are weary many are tired many are trying to put it all together and trying to understand tomorrow but as we heard the word tonight and you made it more real i want to find that white flower i don't want to talk about the chaos and the desert and all the poison show me the flower with every head bowed i wonder who would lift up your hand and say

chaplain was weeping and crying saying god has it all come down to this oh jesus open our eyes lord i have both of my hands lifted up lord open my eyes lord and if any of us have gotten hardened and calloused and critical we're always seeing the negative it's sometimes people can have it so good and god do so great of things and they're always seeing the hinder parts they're they're always saying yeah but and they're they lean toward the negative god forgive us all lord when your prophet said it was a positive token lord i pray that you had blessed two son tabernacle i pray that you bless our brother joseph bless every man and woman every little baby oh jesus every child and young person and every elder i bless them tonight i bless this assembly they have been a lighthouse they have been a

want to be in that number don't let anything stop you from being in that number amen i want to sing that little song the anchor holds do we know that song don't you want your anchor to hold where would you like your anchor to hold in the word of god i want my faith to anchor in god's word it doesn't matter what i go through brother john as long as my faith is in christ christ the word it'll hold you're going to get battered your sale is going to get torn life's going to come at you that's right as long as my anchors hold you know anything about boat boats if a storm comes up and the waves are rolling this way if a boat's like this it'll roll that boat roll it this way preached a sermon one time on anchors but if the waves are rolling this way and you throw your anchor into the waves and then the winds begin to blow you it'll always point your boat towards your anchor oh blessed be the name of the lord amen when the troubles come and the storms you can really quickly find out what someone's anchor is it might be their pocketbook it might be their healthcare card it might be some medicine but when trouble comes they'll point right towards their anchor oh for a christian blessed be the name of the lord when the winds blow and sickness comes maybe a financial trouble problems in the church problems in your family amen a real christian to point right towards the anchor the word of god the word says the bible says jesus said it is written it is written amen tonight we don't know what tomorrow holds but let's get our anchor deeply fastened in christ i don't know i might never see you again i might die in a car wreck in a week you never know but i want you so anchored in the word of god when the winds blow you'll just point right towards your anchor and is christ amen let's sing this song and lift it up to the lord [Music] [Music] i have fallen as i face the raging seas [Music] ship sail is torn but my anchor is holy [Music] [Applause] i have fallen [Music] my [Music] amen you may be seated as we just change the order of the service and have this baptism we're gonna have a little food outside after words i don't like to say things about food before because i've had some scars in my life i'll tell you about that one time i was having a youth thing they were in this barn and it was just man we were having this the holy spirit was getting ready to fall i said let's bow our heads and like right there in this other room i heard all the chip bags opening you talk about a preacher plowing man we plowed right through that thing we had a prayer line a people just the holy spirit fell at the end and man just the holy spirit and everybody praising worshiping god at the end the pastor come up and said pray for me brother daniel the next day he said have you never seen the book of acts he said you should have been there last night when young people there in the holy spirit falling down amen so i never like to let the natural few distract us from the spiritual food we want to make sure we keep our attention on the important things in life and that's the word of god man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god it's okay to go do without a little bit of food here and there but we don't want to do without the spiritual food we need it i think it was brother john saying last night as we get deeper and deeper into this battle we see christians getting weaker and weaker and people are canceling their church services like i just don't understand that why in the world would you do that when the battle has never been raging and christians are getting weaker and weaker we're like oh we just give up my goodness god help us not to be like that say lord when they are training and they start getting new tactics let's come to church get in the presence of god and say holy spirit reveal what this is how's the devil getting us how's he coming against my mind and amen let's just raise up a standard against the devil let's not just roll over and pull our anchor up well it's all over and let him turn our ship amen we need to be fighters and warriors amen blessed be the name of the lord we're going to change the order of the service i don't know where brother joseph go did they already whisk him away all right they're up there hope he can hear me amen we're going to have a a baptismal but everything we do we do it because of the bible when a little baby's born we don't baptize that baby because the bible tells us to repent and be baptized and a baby cannot repent it's not cognitive enough to know what right and wrong is and that's why we don't baptize babies but the bible says that jesus did take up little children and bless them so we do have baby dedications where we bring children and we bless them and we give them back to god but a baptism i want to if you have your bibles i want you to turn in some scriptures acts chapter 2 what we do comes from the scriptures and we say amen in churches because the bible they read the scriptures and they said amen we call people brothers because in the scripture they called them brothers amen and so acts the second chapter verse 38 we went through these scriptures last night after the service brother joseph and i and brother daniel we went and in the we were talking about the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ and so in acts chapter 2 verse 36 peter has just been filled with the holy spirit now he comes and preaches the gospel the death burial and resurrection in chapter 2 and in verse 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that jesus had made the same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brother and what shall we do in other words we're lost we've disobeyed god we just hung the savior we crucified him what are we going to do to be saved well how do we rectify this brother ram said this is when peter gave the eternal prescription remember he was given the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'll loose it in heaven so jesus gives him the key brother i am said this was the eternal prescription for salvation he said then peter said unto them repent which means make an about face you're going this way to repent you turn and you go this way asking forgiveness does not mean necessarily repentance sometimes people just repent or they say i'm sorry because they got caught a repentance is a lifestyle change and you say i've done this and i was wrong and i'm sorry and you repent say god forgive me and you turn your life and go the other way and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission for the washing away and the cutting off your of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promise of the holy ghost is unto you and to your children he's talking to the jews and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words he did testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received the word were baptized in the same day they were added unto them about 3 000 souls amen go to romans chapter 8. we're going to find this in the bible when somebody asks you about baptism we say well what we believe comes from the scripture was there anybody sprinkled in the bible there was no one that was sprinkled water over in the bible brother john talked about the eunuch and the bible says that philip came and he preached jesus unto him you go back and look at it i think it's acts 8 said he preached jesus unto him and as he was traveling in the chariot all of a sudden the next subject was the eunuch said well hey here's water i want to get baptized because jesus said go and teach them all that i've commanded you he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved so to preach jesus to someone the next thing that follows that is a repentance and a water baptism is that what the bible teaches us so if you've never been baptized you need to be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins amen so in in romans chapter six verse one what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead and sins live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death so that's what brother john was trying to say is the water is a symbol of the ground when you go past the cemetery there's not parts of you sticking out that's what happens to a lot of people they don't die to everything they say i want to be buried with christ but hey i don't want my wallet to get converted i don't want my day timer and calendar to get converted that's why there were so many people here this morning they're not here tonight they got their cat part of their their sunday morning converted but not their sunday night and god this is a holy day we dedicate this day to the lord so brother ram tells us everybody has a thirst he said the indians they came over here and they had a thirst to worship they put up a totem pole and they were she said everybody has a thirst to worship and there's something in them made in man to worship and they go to church they say oh i've done my religious duty for the week and they just go back home and they just go and live but that's not the christian the christian is dedicated to christ brotherhood tells us that christ the mystery of god revealed every time the door is open that christian is there to line up online word upon lord word and they're dedicated to christ and so we're buried unto death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him paul said i die daily i am crucified with christ that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god amen so we're going to take brother joseph and we're going to bury him in water which is a symbol of of the grave we'll bury him and then when he raises we'll raise the newness of life amen
