was thinking about a child maybe a three-year-old or a two-year-old child and how the mom and the dad they they take the little boy a little girl's hand and they they walk him along and that child doesn't understand where he's going that child doesn't he he doesn't understand and he doesn't need to understand he just needs to hold Mom's hand and that's that's how we are um one day I'm gonna have this guy give his testimony and I'll tell you what it's tremendous how he is here and what he's gone through back home in his home country of Zambia and in Botswana and I know it'll be a blessing to you but I have to warn you I don't think there's going to be a dry eye in this whole place um for uh for next weekend announced that we'll have meetings with Jericho Tabernacle in Phoenix brother Aaron McGary will be preaching on Friday night I will be preaching on Saturday night and brother Steve Robson will be preaching on Sunday morning I will probably um probably go up and I might I might

up for it he'll be he'll be preaching next Sunday we're not sure if it's going to be the morning or the evening surface he's already agreed to it um I wanted to ask for prayer for two friends of mine um one his name is Andrew mellema he I know him in Jeffersonville and uh his wife had a heart attack and died today she's young lady she's Stephanie's age unexpected his son Andrew's son is one of my

promise that we're going to see them on the other side and I want a couple praise um but Justin Badgley here he writes I put in a prayer request for two young women a couple of weeks ago for Deidre and Amanda I want to thank the Lord that both both prayers are in the midst of being answered as his light has shined on them since the prayer request was put in and both are now in contact with their mothers and seeking a more positive path and then another one he says same brother Justin he says I want to thank the Lord he knew I had car trouble and I had prayed and he made a way and my car was fixed today praise the Lord [Applause] um I want to share a little something I baptized a sister on Sunday morning and um she obviously she's a ladies lived a hard life she's been on drugs and she she carries the marks from being on drugs you could see it enter and um but I'll tell you what that lady is changing she uh sister Amelia was given the testimony to me earlier she said that she's been going around the building that she lives in and preaching to other people how they need to get right [Applause] but brother Daniel she's she's judging the other people sister it's okay praise the Lord that she's she's pointed in the right direction I was so honored to baptize her when she went up there and as I said before to the congregation be patient with these people they've lived a hard life and we see many many coming that that maybe bear the scars of the world but remember that those scars are in our flesh but that Spirit can be renewed so I do appreciate the church's kindness and and the patience and she's she seems very happy am I right sister Amelia God bless her heart you know Define the Lord and as low as she was is it Fentanyl is that uh that was that was one of the drugs that she was taking God just you don't come back from that stuff coming back I I thank the Lord for that I thank the Lord for a group of people that are willing to make us sacrifice and friends we do we we can just we can just have a church that's just all a certain class of people or a certain group of people but what about those Souls that are lost they're the most important Jesus himself said he said it's the ones that are sick that need a physician not the ones that aren't sick I I'm just so blessed and I have a feeling we're gonna have some more baptisms coming up soon [Music] I'm grateful I'm grateful to the Lord let's stand as we bring these requests before our lord Jesus [Music] Bauer heads think on the Lord think on how good he is [Music] and he's here and he answers prayer

believe [Music] D thank you musicians please stay everyone else you may please take your seats for a moment I want to say good evening tonight we're going to continue our study in the book of Acts and it's my privilege and responsibility to share with you this evening that before we dig into Acts I'd like to share a song with you that I've learned Back in 1970 that summer myself brother Francois lipicard of Switzerland and brother John Simon of Guyana all piled onto the bench seat of my Ford pickup truck we headed for a camp meeting just a bit west of Edmonton Alberta Canada we were bringing hundreds of message books and other materials to that meeting three young men packed together in a pickup truck in the middle of summer no air conditioning covering almost 2 000 miles of mostly not freeway stopping only for meals gasoline Francois and I switched off driving Duty John had no driver's license who could afford a hotel or motel we were pretty much they're poor you can imagine we smelled a bit ripe when we arrived in Edmonton the only other time we three have been together after that trip in the summer of 1970 was in the mid-1990s here in Tucson brother John on your right now pastors a church in Ontario brother Francois in the center pastors the church in Switzerland anyway brother John taught us a song that summer and it's applicable to Acts including chapter six which is our chapter for tonight it tells about Peter and John two of the Apostles we've read about so far and it introduces Stephen a primary focus for acts chapters six and seven you may have heard some version of the song it's called almost home if you know it please sing it with me if you don't know it please learn it with me and sing laughs they took the Apostle Peter and beat him more and on but he would not deny the Lord as he had done before they hung him by his feet to die they thought he was alone but he cried out unto the Lord I'm almost home almost home almost home I've got a mansion waiting and I'm almost home almost home almost home I've got a mansion waiting and I'm almost home they took the Apostle John out put him on an Isle to die but he had a great connection with the Lord up in the sky he saw the New Jerusalem they thought he was alone but he said it's not so hard to die when you can't see your home almost home almost home I've got a mansion waiting and I'm almost home almost home almost home I've got a mansion waiting and I'm almost home and now a verse you've probably not heard before even full of faith and power the Holy Ghost also he would not deny the Lord his time had come to go they beat him and they stoned him till his life was almost gone but he looked up to heaven and said oh Lord I'm coming home almost home let's make it plural almost home include those around you we've got a mansion waiting and we're almost home almost home almost home we've got a mansion waiting and we're almost home thank you so much [Applause] I'm excited to be with you this evening act six is a short chapter it's only about 15 verses but it contains lessons for us almost 20 centuries later before we read let's stand once more and invite the Lord once again to be here guide whatever is said that it would suit his Divine purposes Lord Jesus we're truly grateful we're honored we're privileged to be here this evening each one of us and the company of our brothers and sisters and cousins and Lord we just pray Lord that your spirit would continue to move in our midst because we feel your presence here the atmosphere has been set Lord help me Lord to be yielded to you Lord that people wouldn't hear Lyle Johnson because he's got nothing worth hearing but that we would hear from you that you'd meet needs and lives that you'd answer questions and hearts Lord that you draw us closer together and should help us Lord to see the book of Acts as a living book it's alive in our hearts today Lord and Lord we're so grateful that we can know you in this hour we commit the remainder of this service to you now and we thank you for your mercy and your grace your love your kindness your forgiveness we ask it and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen while we're standing please open your Bibles to Deuteronomy chapter 26. we'll read there first then we'll skip to Nehemiah chapter 13. both his background for Acts chapter 6. since it's a Bible study please use your Bible or the one in the seat holder that's in front of you the context for the first scripture is an instruction from Moses or through Moses to the Israelites as they were still in the desert about an action that they were to take after they entered the land of promise and acts we're dealing with a diverse group that has just come to Faith in Jesus Christ the scripture here is dealing with sharing their bounty Deuteronomy 26 verse 11 and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee like his Amazing Grace as we just sang and unto thine house thou and the levite and this stranger that is among you when thou has made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year which is the year of tithing and has given it unto the levite the stranger the fatherless and the Widow why that they may eat within thy Gates and be filled here we see the taking care of strangers widows orphans it's a requirement we're also familiar with the Commandment to perform an incomplete Harvest so the poor May glean the fields we see the importance of that when we read the book of Ruth it's all about sharing and acts we've read the believer's had all things in common sharing next we read from Nehemiah 13 verse 12. then brought all Judah the tithe of the Corn that corn that doesn't mean what we think of this this yellow stuff that we use in foods that we eat it's talking about grain it's talking about barley and it's talking about wheat corn simply means kernel it means grain the tithe of the Grain and new wine and oil unto the treasuries and I as Nehemiah he's the appointed governor of the territory he says I made treasurers over the treasuries shalimaya the priest and zadok the Scribe and of the Levites padaya and next to them was Hanan the son of the zakur the son of matanaya for they were counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their brethren here we see that specific responsibility for the distribution of these agricultural products was assigned the context is that it had not been properly collected or distributed prior to nehemiah's intervention we'll see the parallel in Acts chapter 6. please be seated let's pause a moment and recap what we read in acts so far in chapter 1 Jesus ascends there's a small group of some 120 Believers waiting in Jerusalem they'd been promised the baptism of the Holy Spirit to give them power to be witnesses to Jesus Christ I'm sure they were uncertain what that exactly meant or how it would manifest itself meanwhile the 11 disciples appointed Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot and bring their number back to 12. chapter 2 recorded the first in filling of the spirit on Pentecost they may not have accurately anticipated what it would be but they had no doubt when it happened Peter's first sermon to the crowd gathered near David's tomb the formula repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ receive the Holy Spirit was first summarized we we hear that there are three thousand that were added to their number and it's also the first mention of having things in common sharing Acts 3 and related to miraculous very public healing of a lame beggar through Peter and John for decades he's been bigger unable to walk having severely deformed ankles and feet instantly made whole walking and leaping praising God the disturbance gave opportunity for Peter's second recorded sermon this time in Solomon's Colonnade within the temple area acts 4 told her the overnight Detention of Peter and John and it appears the beggar some five thousand are added as a result of Peter's interrupted sermon Peter and John are threatened and released the Believers hear this report these threatens and their response is to pray for boldness and God's response is the second infilling of the Holy Spirit the building is shaken the second mention of things being in common and it introduces Barnabas which gives us a background for Paul's first stop in his first missionary journey that we'll talk about when we get to Acts 13. acts 5 which Pastor Daniel taught from last Sunday evening recorded the death of ananias and his wife they don't lie dying they die lying further miracles of healing and spreading of the Faith by the apostles the second arrest of Peter and other Apostles in their release a few hours later by an Angel they're found teaching in the temple the next morning and they're arrested for the third time the Sanhedrin Council seeks to kill them in order to silence them but Gamaliel intervenes instead they're flogged that means they're beaten with whips that tear the flesh further threatened and released they Rejoice that they can suffer for Christ let's turn now to act six starting at the first verse we read King James version in those days which days are these 24-hour periods are they 1 000 year Millennials or is it a more generic reference during these times I I think that's what it means and how do we determine which days these might be when the number of disciples was multiplied other translations read as a number of disciples was greatly increasing so we're looking at an early period of the church a time of rapid growth and numbers and these people are all self-sacrificing walking in complete unity all of One mind all of One Accord they're super Saints right right there were Rosa murmuring of the grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration [Music] um they're not super Saints ah I'm part of that group well this brings up several questions well who are the grecians or does that mean that they're Greeks they're gentiles who are the the Hebrews weren't they all Jewish at this time what does it mean when it says that kind of mumbling or what are daily that are the apparent reason for this murmuring in the first place some of this is slightly clarified in the following verses but I think it's more easily understood if we look to a different translation for this verse and the NIV it reads in those days when the number of disciples was increasing the Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the hebraic Jews because there the hellenists widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food huh so these are all Jewish people but some of them are Hellenistic whatever that means what what is meant by a Hellenistic Jew what we have here is a clash between cultures it here's a little background recall that Israel is a nation ceased to exist several hundred years prior and self-rule ended with the conquest of Judah around 586 BC well that may be a little hard to see but that's uh on the left side as you're facing it is the Mediterranean Egypt is below it this little tiny Speck here is Jerusalem this is Israel but this whole territory that's in color is an Alexander conquered so he conquered this territory by about 325 BC and he infused Greek culture into the conquered region language arts social values philosophy religion Under The Maccabees a brief period of Independence in in Israel what we think of is Israel and sued about 200 years before the events recorded in Acts the land we think of is Israel then became a vassal state to Rome and with Rome behind him Herod the Great and irumian seized control of the provinces of Judea Galilee and so forth part of the local Jewish population clung to the old ways and language although it is reported as Hebrew here was more likely Aramaic kind of a street Hebrew if you others adopted many Greek Customs Greek as a language was so widespread in that area that a Greek language translation of the Hebrew scriptures known as the Septuagint occurred during the third and second centuries BC under the ptolemies who ruled Egypt after the breakup of Alexander's Kingdom in fact you'll find that the scriptures quoted in the New Testament are from the Septuagint which differs in many places in minor ways from the Hebrew text this Greek or Hellenistic influence is widespread throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and what we now call the Middle East it had been for nearly 400 years so the Hellenistic Jews were those who had lived under or embraced to some degree Greek language and culture the bottom line for Luke's purposes is that the hellenized Jews complained that the needy in their ranks were not being treated as equals with the non-hellonized and the distribution of relief there was division there was a schism one assumes it was the hebraic Jews that were administering the relief whatever it was food clothing money other forms of aided assistance we don't know if any of the apostles were involved directly we're not told where or how or how many how things were handled in general at this time is unclear we're just told they had things in common we do know that not everyone sold their homes it wasn't a commune as you might think of today we're reading in a later chapter about an event at John Mark's house for example finally it's interesting to note that the term disciple used in the gospel accounts to almost always mean the twelve is now being used by Luke to describe the general body of Believers all our now-term disciples which really means Learners or pupils we'd say students well let's go on to verse two we read then the 12 apostles called the multitude of disciples Believers unto them in other words they had a general congregational meeting and said it's not reason it's not reasonable it isn't appropriate it would not be right that we should leave neglect the ministry or the teaching or the preaching of the word of God and serve tables oversee the distribution of food run a food program these complaints had become such an issue that a meeting was called of everyone to settle the matter the apostles were not interested in being distracted by this they were filled with the Holy Spirit to be Proclaimers of Jesus's Messiah and they wanted to retain that Focus in verse 3 we read wherefore and so Brethren look ye Out Among you you choose from among yourselves seven men oh this suggests there were more than a few widows that were being neglected if to administer it properly would take seven men these seven men of honest report ethical honest whose trustworthiness you as a group recognize and accept and Beyond simply being honest they must each be recognized as being full of the Holy Ghost full not just a little not just a taste but full of the holy spirit and wisdom wisdom so they can deal with human frailties and emotions see below the surface whom we may appoint you'll select them but they will become our Representatives with our full Authority behind them to be put in charge of this Duty over this business but we 12 Apostles will give ourselves continually spend our time exclusively in prayer and to the ministry the teaching and preaching of the word the gospel the good news that Jesus is the Messiah who brings eternal life to those who accept him the saying the direction given by the apostles pleased the whole multitude that's the multitude of Believers including those who are murmuring and they the Believers at large chose the following seven individuals we're not told the means or the methods that they use to select these seven but they were Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and Philip is not the Apostle but another the same name and pro-chorus and nikonur and Timon and parminus and Nicholas across the light of Antioch a proslight in this case simply means that he was a person who converted to the Jewish faith so we assume he was a pagan he became a Jew he from Antioch he went down to Jerusalem and now he has been converted and he is a Christian and he is risen in the ranks to the point where people respect and trust him and he's filled with the Holy Spirit we see that the congregation was pleased with this proposed solution to the problem then they the body of believers who were all converts from the Jewish faith this had an ordained hierarchy of high priests and Priests and Levites from the time of Moses some 1500 years before they were accustomed to this sort of thing it was in their DNA we might say what we see here is a formal division of Labor or responsibility the beginnings of a church hierarchy this may well have been a seed planted which later allowed the spirit of the Nicolaitans to take authority in the first church age Revelation 2 6 but this thou Hast that thou hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate the church is changing from a body of believers to one that consists of Apostles and pastors and Bishops and overseers and deacons and so forth It's a process that begins it takes time this kind of organization or structure is not necessarily evil in fact it's often necessary but the great Danger is that it can condition people to substitute a hierarchy of human authority and assigned responsibility in place of an intimate relationship with the holy spirit to guide and direct and reveal we must all be vigilant to not fall into such a trap brother Aaron has shared with us and he was sitting back there and he would look at his password if his Pastor raised his hand he'd raise his hand if the Pastor said amen he'd say amen and then the Lord told him that man's not your Holy Ghost we need to have that relationship with the Holy Spirit well back to verse 5 if you look at this list of names Stephen Phillip prokary Smith you'll notice these are not Greek forms of Hebrew names like Jeremy for Jeremiah or isaiahs for Isaiah or Elias for Elijah these are Greek names the seven chosen men appear to be of the hellenized group none of them have hebraic name okay so whom they said before the apostles in other words the congregation brought the seven before the apostles and when the apostles had prayed the apostles laid their hands on the seven and it's the last we hear of the problem laying on of hands it's a very Jewish thing to do having contact or at least it was at this time James a leader of the Jewish segment of the early church advises laying hands and anointing with oil and the apostles are all converts from Judaism in fact they don't see themselves as not being Jew this will become a big controversy in a few chapters when Peter and Cornelius meet God moves the spirit fills some non-jewish people that accept the gospel message it will also guide the later Jerusalem Council in Acts chapter 15 regarding Gentile believers who set certain rules to ensure that they'll be accepted to enter Jewish synagogues to hear the reading of the of the word the Tanakh the Torah the Bible of the day what we call the Old Testament understand that the synagogues were the only way that a follower of Jesus could hear the word to hear it read whether in Hebrew or Greek there were no Bibles skulls are outrageously expensive and most people were not able to read my friends literacy which is so common in our world today is a great gift of our society end of our times similarly inexpensive Bibles in abundance or or free downloads to our smartphones and computers leave us no excuse to be unfamiliar with its contents Luke tells us in his gospel quoting Jesus in Luke 12 48 he says from everyone who has been given much will be demanded and from the one who has been entrusted with much much more will be asked verse 7. the word of God the gospel message that Jesus is the Messiah increased it kept spreading the number of the disciples multiplied increased in Jerusalem greatly and a great company a large number of the priests were obedient to the faith I I wonder when I read that what a conundrum that must have been for a priest to be offering a sacrifice at the temple but he's a Christian he's accepted Jesus as his Messiah as his sacrifice but he's offering this a I it would have been interesting to talk to one of these fellows and find out how they dealt with this well I I note that in some of my Bibles you've probably notice it in yours is this heading of of this chapter six it says that this group of seven are sometimes called the first deacons I don't know if you've noticed that in your Bible I said my Scofield bible it's not in the text we didn't read anything about Deacons and in fact if you do a search you'll find that the word Deacon only appears twice in the Bible twice I'm talking about English of course and that both times in first Timothy 3 where Paul is telling about the qualifications for a deacon it's interesting that he talks about the qualifications but not the duties so why are these seven so often referred to as the first Deacons well the word Deacon is not used in the text the word translated as serve like we just read in verse two about serving tables is the same Greek word diacaneo which means to wait upon menially as a host or friend to minister unto to serve and and this Greek word diacaneo occurs 37 times in 32 verses in the New Testament it's translated Deacon only in first Timothy 3. and it's the only word that's translated as deacon the qualifications if you read first Timothy 3 mirror what the apostles laid out here in verse 3. diaconao is more often translated as Minister it's translated this way in Corinthians Hebrews find amen first Peter and it's the very word translated as ministered when describing the women who ministered to Jesus and the disciples in all four gospels makes me wonder if maybe they were the first Deacons not formally of course these seven were the first in that sense but in other words these are people who render service regarding physical needs within the assembly I can't help but recall what we've read so far the words of Jesus again re record reported by Luke in Luke 22 verse 24. we read there was also a Strife a Strife this is this is an argument this is a fight Strife is a stronger word than for example they've had a gentle discussion it was Strife among the 12 disciples about which of them should be accounted the greatest hmm this is not the first time that this argument broke out but now as at the very end of Jesus ministry and they still don't get it so Jesus said unto them the kings are the Gentiles exercise lordship over the gentile people and and they that exercise this Authority upon them are called benefactors benefactor the word here it means a worker of good a philanthropist a a friend of the people using irony with this label he might have done air quotes just as I did around that word pilate certainly was not Jesus benefactor nor was Nero Paul's benefactor I suspect the disciples likely laughed at this description just like tell Herod that fox but however when the laughter stopped who's got their attention again he says ye shall not be so but instead he that is greatest among you that's what you think you want to be your role model is incorrect don't think like the Gentiles don't think like the Heathen rather let him be as the younger and he that is Chief rather than exercise some sort of lordship because he that doth serve there's that same word again diacaneo here is serve the disciples must have looked at each other when he said this for weather which who is greater the one that sits at the table to eat or the one that serves the one who is seated is not he that sitteth at me but around guys wake up I am among you as he that serveth there's that word again diacaneos twice in verse 27. well moving on in Acts Luke now leaves the issue of solving the distribution problem it's not mentioned again we read Stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people and I don't think that this was handing out food it's not serving tables in other words Stephen is doing the same work as the apostles who didn't want to serve tables and I don't mean that disrespectfully frankly I find it mildly amusing but we all need to recognize that we're in a different place in our walk with Christ we can't judge others based on where we think way we are or where we think that someone else should be we are all imperfect people Works in progress on a life Journey via the Cross of Christ to our eventual transition from physical life as brother Daniel spoke on Sunday a newborn baby doesn't walk doesn't eat solid food some are born quietly some are born less quietly there's growth involved I shared a bit in Sister Angela's class before Sunday school with two of her students about growth that someday the little girl sitting at the craft table would be a full-grown woman like her mommy but that's a process it takes time it reminds me of another song when I learned from Brother Francois also in 1970. don't worry I'm not going to sink this song basically says read your Bible and pray every day if you want to grow he taught it to me in French and then translated it to English we used to sing it quite often in any event we now see Stephen doing the work as an apostle a work of an evangelist I can't help but think of my youth I I was so excited when NASA announced the first Seven astronauts the Mercury Seven in 1959 I was nine years old I memorized their names committed their photographs to memory admired their spacesuits I was euphoric When Alan Shepard launched into space for a few minutes soon after I turned 11. and when John Glenn orbited the Earth 10 minutes later a couple of weeks after I turned 12. everyone talked about those events my friends at school my parents snatches of conversation overheard in random places the second group of astronauts weren't nearly as instantly famous their names not quite as impactful when they were announced they were known as the next nine were or the new nine and selected in 1962 but several months after John Glenn's mission but among this group was Frank Borman raised in Tucson he became famous for publicly reading from the Genesis creation account in the Bible while orbiting the moon as commander of Apollo 8 in December 1968. Neil Armstrong commander of Apollo 11 the first human to walk on the moon two names many of us recognize so we had both the Mercury Seven and the new nine and the astronaut core and in the New Testament in Acts six we have the 12 apostles and then this second group of men whose names we just read the second group became known as the seven but we'll see this when we get to Acts 21. and like the new nine astronauts there are two names that stand out from this second group Stephen and Philip we're now looking at Stephen Philip will come along in Acts chapter 8. well back to acts six verse 9. then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of The Libertines at the translations read there arose certain of the freedmen as it was called or of the free Jewish slaves as it was called and the membership of the synagogue included cyrenians I'm sure would I put up that map you all zeroed in on a little spot on North Africa and Tanya appointment said Cyrene so you know where that is right if I say it's like Tunisia or Libya probably still will give me a blank look but that's all right sirenians and alexandrians those are from Egypt North Africa and also included men of them of cilicia and Asia this is parts of what we now call Turkey and they were disputing with Stephen disputing is a pretty strong word disputing has a negative connotation and modern usage the Greek conveys the sense of reasoning discussing questioning What's Happening Here is exactly how Paul and others carried the gospel in one convert says we'll read in later chapters in Acts remember there were two primary sects within Judaism at this time the Pharisees and the Sadducees the Sadducees were very strict conservative they ran the temple they dominated the Sanhedrin Council as well Pharisees on the other hand were more liberal focused on the word that the Scrolls the writings how to apply them to daily life they were all about rules they were not focused so much on the temple in its ritual Jesus had many discussions with the Pharisees the gospel accounts often portray the Pharisees as being insincere trying to trip Jesus up in his own words certainly it's true in some and perhaps even most cases but this was how Pharisees learned that's how rabbis learned today when when a young child is put into Yeshiva to study the the Bible the Torah the writings they're paired so that they can argue back and forth so they can test each other so they can they can drive things in a little deeper they don't just listen to the teacher droning on and on but they have discussions amongst themselves so debate is always encouraged staking out defending positions interpretations probing for weaknesses and Mark's account of the man asking Jesus about the greatest commandment Jesus is sympathetic tells the man he's not far from the kingdom of God but in Matthew's account of the same conversation the Pharisee is almost portrayed as an enemy the King James version uses the word tempted which and in our uses is a pejorative it has a negative connotation but a better word today might be tested to to scrutinize examine objectively inquire understand the basis of the statement or the position well in this case we'll see that these men debating with Stephen became frustrated decided to keep up appearances by cheating thus their discussion became disputing verse 10 and they these folks from this synagogue of The Libertines were not able to resist to overcome to refute the wisdom and the Spirit by which Stephen spake a lot of times if you're listening to some of the messages of brother Branham you can feel the spirit in which he's saying things and that carries oftentimes as much or more weight than the words that he says so these folks they were unwilling to convert they were unwilling to concede so they suborned men what does suborned means it means to secretly persuade not not in public views go behind persons back they support they induce men which said oh oh oh we've heard Stephen speak Blasphemous words impious just respectful words against Moses and against God and they this aborned man along with those who would support them stirred up the people so they didn't just say this once and then went home and the elders and the scribes and Came Upon Stephen who wasn't hiding and caught the word who caught it means they They seized him they snatched him and they brought him to the council now this is the same Council that had Peter and others flogged in chapter four and had no compunctions about brutalizing people who disagreed with them or from whom they felt threatened in their positions and the the men who couldn't withstand Stephen's arguments set up false Witnesses you'll see this phrase in the King James frequently false Witnesses just think Liars they set up Liars and and by doing that they're violating the very law that they claim to follow and defend the ninth of the Ten Commandments Exodus 2016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor and and there's a price to pay for bearing false Witnesses it's detailed in Deuteronomy 19 but the gist of it is if you come and lie about something about your neighbor and the expected result of that is that he's going to be punished in some way maybe pay a fine or be put to death if it's discovered that you're lying you will be subject to that same fine or that same death this is very serious in the law and the rules if you obey them so they had these false Witnesses which said this man ceases not to speak Blasphemous words in other words Steven's constantly saying Blasphemous words against this holy place oh the temple offending the Sadducees and the law the written word of God thus offending the Pharisees these are the two groups whose leadership comprise the council this these lies were targeted specifically to enrage that Council for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth what these guys are probably talking in the name of Jesus of Nazis his very counsel has forbidden that to happen so now if they're calling into question the authority of the council and shall destroy this place loosen up Sadducees and shall change the Customs which Moses delivered us you got that Pharisees this is such blatant hypocrisy by the council you know you may be surprised but I found a picture of the council the court and the lying witnesses that Stephen faced that day let me show it to you the kangaroo court is is a proceeding and its leaders who are considered sham corrupt and without regard for the law this isn't in Moscow this is in Jerusalem this is his Council recall the high priest the chief judge is sitting here ananias and Caiaphas were the very ones that had sought lying testimony false witnesses to destroy Jesus they knew the game they were playing with Jesus life and now with the life of Stephen they had no respect for the law they imposed on everyone else justifying their own sin as being for the greater good note Stephen is facing the very same accusation as Jesus before the same Council the same judges Matthew 26 57 we read and they that had laid hold on Jesus the soldiers of the guards led by Judas is carried and Gethsemane Let Jesus away to Caiaphas the same Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and Elders were assembled but Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's Palace Palace what a contrast and went in and sat with the servants to see the end now the chief priests and elders and all the council the chief priests and the elders and all the council sought false witness against Jesus put him to death Deuteronomy 19 says all of those guys should have suffered a death penalty as a result they they found none yet though many false Witnesses came yet they found none at last came to liars and said this fellow said I am able to destroy the temple of God and build it in three days and the high priest arose and said to Jesus answer thou nothing what is it which he's witness against thee Jesus held his peace back to Acts 6. and all that sat on the council for hearing this false testimony looking steadfastly intently fastening their eyes on Stephen so his face is his countenance his appearances demeanor as it had been that of an Angel there are no explanations of what this means the face of an Angel what no other examples and Acts or elsewhere that I could find that deal with what the face of an Angel might look like or what the expression might mean brother Branham clarifies it he tells us in four different sermons it doesn't mean that he glowed it doesn't mean that a beam of light came down from heaven and illuminated him it simply means he was a messenger he was displaying complete confidence absolutely certain of what he said he was unshakable and verse 7 it starts out then said the high priest to Stephen are these things so that you said this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and change the Customs Moses delivered to us and Stephen said men Brethren and fathers hearken listen to what I'm going to tell you please musicians come to your instruments yeah we're going to stop here you want to find out what happened you're going to have to come and hear our Pastor Daniel tell you what happened in Acts chapter 7 because we've just run out of chapter six but but in closing remember what Jesus said about greatness about service that we'd be known by our fruits by our love the people we find in acts are no different than we are we're told thousands upon thousands were added to the ranks of the Believers but we're not told very many names just because a person's name only appears once or twice don't assume it means they fell out of fellowship or abandoned the faith Luke's trying to tell certain things to record them for us as a Spirit guides him a lack of evidence is not the same as evidence of a lack it's not important that our names be recorded for posterity here on Earth what is important is that our names are found and remain and the Lamb's Book of Life I'd like to close with the song that I closed with last time it's the life behind the name it was appropriate for Peter in Acts 3. I think it fits Stephen's testimony as well and now that I know that you're familiar with the song I'd like you to do everyone a favor and drown me out it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes the proud part of [Music] he would live live so he could give give us the life behind the name once again it's the life behind the name that makes the demons trouble life behind the name that makes the cloud work humble it was God who divides the plan that in all things as a man he would live live so he could give us the light behind the name again [Music] please [Applause] let's all stand as we sing it's like behind the name behind [Music] [Applause] how do you devise the plan that it all things give us [Music] it was good to be here tonight amen brother Amos could you come here and help me for a second again brother a Mr microphone brother uh brother more woman asked you to close in prayer okay [Music] friends I always [Music] brother okay I am I always learned something when our brother preaches and it's always something that makes me a better person and thinking about the kind of the theme that brother Lyle and I have both been preaching on this book of Acts it's that these were normal everyday people and I love what he's what you brought out in the very first first there that they even had disputing among themselves and his brother Lyle said these are Holy Spirit-filled people in perfect unity and they were but they still had little little things because we're human and it's it's okay praise God you know we we worry so much about things about this person said this and all the preacher said that and I didn't like the way to do that who cares is not a big deal the Lord's going to take care of it just like he did right here in the book of Acts and it's pretty soon my friend it's gonna go to the Gentiles and and things are going to get really really big God bless you all brother Merle if you would close in prayer precious Heavenly Father worth thankful for another service to enjoy it here amen bring forth expectations and things Lord to help us to understand we pray Lord that you'll go with each and every one of us be with us encourage our hearts and the things we've heard and help us to go stronger through these next days Lord amen [Music] pray your blessings upon each one thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy Lord thank you Lord for the Forgiveness of our sins amen thank you Father [Music] let me ask it in the precious name the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you friends I don't know if I said it right I'll be ministering this weekend then brother Jonathan um he and I will both be ministering the following weekend if I wasn't clear about that I want everyone to know the schedule let's um let's keep keep things in prayer keep as I mentioned this situation in Kenya in in prayer and and the things that are going on there these are people that um probably some of our friends in Kenya might know brother brother David you know the situation I'm talking about my friend you do um serious serious situation over there and it would it probably has the potential to bring some bad reproach on some of the things that we hold dear so so keep that in prayer keep each other in prayer and um let's have a good week in the name of our Lord Jesus God bless you all it's a life behind the name one more time it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble that makes them full it was God who devised [Music] be honorable [Music] and May and makeup [Music] we appreciate it when brother Jonathan was leaking leading songs earlier I got a text from a good friend I won't say his name um but it says at the top it says hear from Brother Jordan it says for years I've wanted to Charter a plane and take the congregation to Africa didn't think about bringing Africa's worship here God bless you all you're dismissed in the name of our Lord Jesus [Music] The Rock s of myself oh magnify the Lord with me for him [Music] magnify [Music] for him [Music] please bring to his name is [Music] Glory Glory To This Day foreign [Music] Blessed Be The Rock [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] me you can kill my body when I was sick you should have been good because somebody when I was somebody when I was sick was sick you sure [Music] [Applause] [Music] mind when I'm home [Music] imagine he's gone with us [Music] ing his name is [Music] Paul [Music] foreign [Music] flow through your Holy Spirit [Music] foreign [Music] today [Music] foreign thank you [Applause] [Applause] thank you all right [Music] foreign
