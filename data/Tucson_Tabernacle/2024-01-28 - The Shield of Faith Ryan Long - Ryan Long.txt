update on brother Glenn and what God has done the red line Mike so I want to say thank you for everybody who's been praying so about two and a half weeks ago my dad started um internally bleeding and so he got taken by ambulance to the hospital seemed like he was doing okay it seemed like you but he got he got taken from Cottonwood because there Inon he got taken from Cottonwood to um where they had an available bed in Phoenix and he's been there ever since for two and a half weeks and he's been bleeding not bleeding bleeding you know and it's kind of been kind of um you know trying to sort out what's going on is it stopping is it you know what's going on and so they were going to move him to a different hospital where the GI doctor that he's been talking to Works in that Network and they were waiting for a bed to come available and finally a bed came available they were supposed to transport him on like Monday night and he was tired he said don't so they came back the next night to transport him and he's like I do not feel well enough to do this like they had just done and um endoscopy where they went down the throat and were were taking pictures and stuff like that so that was Monday night they came to transport him very early Tuesday he started bleeding uncontrollably and the nurse that was taking care of my dad at that point he um started calling some shots this nurse is only about a year and a half into their nursing thing but he was just an absolute Angel he he started doing things he started calling for things whatever um they in eventually if you know my dad uh you'll find this amusing he they eventually had to say date him put him under for him to stop talking but he was he was praying out loud he was just doing whatever he could he was calling on the name of the Lord and finally they're like you got to stop talking they and they put him out and they started pumping blood into him it was not by the unit it was by the box and by the time that they got done with him they had used over 50 units of blood plasma and blood units a unit is about a half a liter so that was approximately five gallons that they used and the hos the hospital staff afterwards said it's an absolute miracle that you lived and talking to my oldest sister who's been a nurse for over 20 years she says the all I've only seen that done a few times in my own career and she said that was on gona and trauma victims so they were able to find he it turns out that he had an aneurysm of the spleenic artery which goes so it's the artery that goes straight to the bleed they're able to locate that they were able to plug it up um it's not fun watching somebody intubated and then watching them come out of it but he came out of it he's sitting up he is talking and whatnot so that was just a little thing where we were sitting there going okay the Lord's got his hand on it we did get results back on Thursday that the mass that we thought was just assist is actually a fairly rare cancer and it's massive um so we are you know and then it was like you can't do really can't do radiation we don't have chemo treatment that will really touch it essentially it's our options are kind of like go home and Live Well to the end of your life type of thing except my sister texted a friend and she said my dad has had that cancer for the last number of years this is what we've been using so it's like a little ray of light sitting there're going okay here's here's something that it looks like maybe the Lord has dropped in our laps to say this is an opportunity and a possibility they are looking for other treatments to try for him um to see what they can do to shrink it but we absolutely covet your prayers but just having that little miracle dropped in our lap where even the hospital staff was saying this is a miracle has been enough to sit there and remind us that no matter what we do God's got everything under [Applause] control we serve a God it is more than able sometimes we question sometimes we ask why but he knows what's best amen you know one of these days he's going to call us all home not a sick not a weak not a troubled one at all oh When the Saints Go Marching I'm going to be in that number amen testify I'm going to be in oh I'm a pilgrim and a stranger wondering through this world of sin on my way to that fair City When the Saints Go Marching In

sister Grant and brother Grant good to good to have them with us you know Sister Grant spent a lot of time here and her kids her boys were I kind of adopted them as my boys took them out a lot and did a lot of things and I always wondered did I do them any good did I help them and it was her son Nathaniel that said brother Aon will'll never know what he meant to us so you share what you got help somebody you never know the effect that's going to have on somebody so this this morning we have our brother Ryan long down we have his family his wife and his children with us God bless them um I know you get to hear them all the time we get to hear them again or we were we were blessed the last time he was here it was such a such an inspiring s so trust it that the Lord would would speak again how many how many need something from the Lord today you know you need something and brother Ryan doesn't know what that is but God does and he could take a brother that's ministering suddenly just go in this direction and meet that and then go back to his sermon I've seen that happen over and over I'll share a testimony I was at a meeting one day and it was a brother preaching and he had a lot of energy and a lot of lot of uh just just and I was sitting up in and it was on the balcony area and we're sitting up there and I said oh Lord if I could just be like that brother if I not and I started to say that in my mind and I'm sitting on that side and he moves over that way and it looks like he's looking directly at me and he said now brother you got to be yourself you got to be who you are you can't be like me just started to say that for about 30 seconds and then he went right back and kept on preaching God knew exactly what I was where I was sitting and what I was thinking so he can meet your your need the same way so amen have your way have your [Music] way have your way have your way Holy Spirit fill our our hearts and have your way as we wait and as we pray speak your word into our hearts and have your way as our brother Ryan comes have your way have your way Holy Spirit fill our heart and have your way as we wait and as we pray speak your word let's just sing that again if we could have your have your way hold me Spirit fill our heart and have your way as we wait as we wait as we pray speak your words into our hearts and have your way amen as they just continue to play that sof pleas sister let's just bow our heads if we could Lord Lord we just love you and want to approach you this morning Lord as as humbly as we're able to Lord and Lord as a needy people and Lord you've made us you've made us this way Lord you've made us to be able to cry out to you Lord in our time of need we want to do that this morning Lord we want to Lord just set aside any any obstacles any things in our minds Lord in our hearts that might be between us and you this morning Lord maybe distractions Lord from yesterday or from this morning Lord would you just help us to get those out of the way Lord you may speak directly to our hearts this morning Lord we we want to just lean on you and rely on you Lord for all of our our needs Lord and Lord we want our praise and our worship to go to you Lord just unhindered father unfiltered Lord just from our hearts to you Lord just appreciate you Lord and what you've done for us this morning what you continue to do for us tomorrow Lord would you just come now and open your word to us this morning Lord and just one word from you father would just mean so much and I I believe would just encourage us Lord to make it through another day Lord until you're coming father and Lord we just want to ask you just as sincere as we we can Lord would you just come and speak to us this morning Lord we ask all these things in Jesus name amen God bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning how many how many feel the same amen and it's good to come down and be with you here in in Tucson here at the Tabernacle and just uh really do uh don't want it to be just words or really do deem it a privilege to stand before you and um we appreciate the Pastor here brother Dan and his uh invitation and and the the willingness to for you to come and listen and and to be here this morning brother Aaron appreciate the hospitality brother Ed that just taking just such good care of us I I just have nothing but but uh but goodness in my heart toward you and um don't know what uh brother Dan necessarily sees in me but I'll just appreciate it I definitely don't see that in myself and don't think that I'm uh you know most of the time time you get invited and you speak and maybe that's the last time you ever go back so it's a privilege to to stand before you again and that the church wasn't half as full so you know that's a good sign and so just uh want to uh take some time maybe just talk to you this morning from my heart if that's okay and uh let's read a scripture and then you could have your seats thank you to the Musicians I appreciated that special uh sister and brother that was real nice I was in the back and just enjoyed that uh Ephesians 6 let just read a script one scripture here or two and then we'll just let you have your seats how many is feeling okay this morning all right if you're not feeling okay you came to the right place this morning and uh we we serve a God that uh like the brothers said it can turn it around just just instantly and turn it around he could speak to you and you know I I don't have a an if an issue with confidence because you know when there's when there's Believers in the in the congregation who are needing something and when they have uh the faith to pull God is actually obligated to meet their need and so as as a as a person standing up here unworthy to stand before you you know I could worry about what do I what am I going to say to help you and and the answer is nothing I can't say anything to help you but God through his sovereignty can pull from somebody who doesn't know anything about your need and doesn't know anything in general and give you exactly what you have need of and so that is what I want to lean on this morning and I pray that you would lean on that same thing this morning if you came to hear me you're going to be disappointed morning but if you came to hear something from God and receive something that you know it's not just uh well I want this little thing but that that one thing that would just save your life I don't know if you're in the same situation as me but sometimes I just don't need to hear a good a good word but I need something to save my very life and to keep me going that day and the next day and that's what the Lord is willing and able and wanting to give to you this morning so um just if you need have a need pull if you have a need don't just tell God God I'm not leaving this spot until you help me until you give me what it is that I have need of and watch him you know he loves he loves to hear a child of his say that he he doesn't you know he doesn't get offended at that that's what he wants us to do he wants us to pull from him amen let's just read this scripture Ephesians 6 and this is um I think a familiar scripture we'll just read um one or two verses here in uh Ephesians 6 verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GED about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication to the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen you may be seated and uh well I don't know if of a day that's more applicable to that when it's talking about if you are standing in the evil day I don't think there's a more evil day than we've been um I would say a privilege to live in you say well why do you say that because this this is this is the age that that many people in the Bible brother Brown would tell us long to live in this age even though it's the most evil age this is the age we should be most encouraged and proud to live in and that's because you know it's not because we're special it's because you know in in the darkness as the days get darker you will be brighter and you don't have to do anything more you don't have to be more uh more special than somebody else but a a a light will shine brighter in the darkest day than it will in the daytime and you know the same the same type of faith that we read about in the Bible we have to have that faith and I believe that we do that's why we were placed in this day amen and so in this evil day we we we have this scripture I think we I think most of us are familiar with it but it's talking about the armor of God and I just wanted to to take one of these and um I pray that the Lord will will just guide what want to talk about this morning I I I talked a little bit with brother Dan yesterday and um he kind of told me what uh you know what to expect maybe and and just kind of gave me some encouragement which I appreciated and I I didn't know exactly what I want to talk about but you you forgive me I just want to relax a little bit this morning I'm not a not a great um not a great anything but I'm definitely not a evangelist or I could say I barely even know how to speak a little bit uh but I just want to tell you what's on my heart and I just want to talk to you this morning so you know this this scripture about this this uh this Armor of God it it applies to the Christian applies to you and I and you say it does it applies to whether you are a new Christian or whether you're a Christian that's been in the in in a Christian for 30 40 50 years we have to have this Armor of God and and if you don't have this Armor of God you well you're not going to have a very good time in battle and if you decided if you have made the decision to be a Christian you have also at the same time decided to be in a battle and so this Armor of God is important and just wanted to to take one of them out of here that just says above all taking the shield of faith and and uh I had i' done a little bit of study on this and I I had studied what why it was so important and you know it's maybe I don't have a visual for you but you know I I pictured a a an army of soldiers lined up together a picture of an army of soldiers lined up together and they had their armor on brother Aaron but you know one of the most important things that they have is their Shield that's right and you know the shield is important because the shield it it's not necessarily an offenseive weapon but it protects you against the attacks which you are going to be attacked and and I don't know about you but I'm going through attacks myself right now so it's not just something well I'm going to be attacked tomorrow no I'm I'm being attacked right now uh mentally spiritually whatever it might be you're being attacked and this Shield but the beautiful part about the shield and I and I was I was looking at these different armies that that have existed through times use of course we don't use Shields now really but but we're talking about this armor and these these armies that have existed with these shields they would stand in a formation they would stand right next to each other and so their Shields would actually start to overlap into somebody else's Shield yes sir and what would happen is the the armies that were great and the armies that really conquered the world like the Roman armies they stood in a way where their Shield protected them but it also provided protection for the person next to them and you know I started to think about that a little bit as as a as a as a human being although I believe I'm a I'm a soldier of in the army of the of the Lord do you believe that now sometimes we don't feel very soldierly right right sometimes we don't we don't feel like we do the best about fighting sometimes the devil fights us and we lose most of the time I don't know I feel I feel like that sometimes and I wonder am I really an a soldier in the army of the Lord but I I want to encourage you and tell you you might lose and you might you might get injured you might actually make the mistake maybe it's not just the devil who's fighting against you but you might decide to do something you you know you shouldn't do and it's and it's completely your failure but I still want to tell you that you're a soldier in the army of the Lord and that's you could say well that sounds real great but I don't feel like a soldier but I'll take you to the word and I'll take you to the to the message that tells you despite your failings and despite the way that you feel you are a soldier in the army of the Lord and and and I think a lot of times we have these failures and these weaknesses to so that so that God exposes what it is that we're weak to I don't know about you but a lot of times I fail and and immediately I know what I'm vulnerable to what my weak points are and maybe maybe yours are different than mine I'm sure that they are and maybe something I struggle with if I were to tell you about it you would say brother why do you struggle with that right and each one of us if we were to share with one another well I don't struggle with that but that's the whole point of being in the army of the Lord is that brother Aaron I might see your weakness but if I'm a soldier I'm going to cover up your weakness see because I have my shield and my shield you know I want to protect myself I want to live but that Shield is also designed that I could go and stand next to my brother and I could protect his weakness and vice versa you might see mine and you know what we could do I don't know about you this this happens you know we could see somebody's weakness and we could go tell somebody else about it that one never gets as many amens but that's that's usually what happens right we see somebody's weakness you know that person they struggle a little bit with showing up to church maybe that person struggles a little bit with uh with prayer I'm just going to name off the ones that I know are true right maybe that that person struggles a little bit with with uh with with a little bit of gossip we talking about somebody right and we see that and a lot of times we'll go to somebody else and you know it maybe the phrase always starts with I just want to tell you about this so you pray for them right but what we're doing a lot of times and what I've been guilty of is instead of covering up their weakness and to help them with it I expose their weakness even more and then they feel like that're they're not a soldier anymore because somebody instead of saying you know what I see that you're weak here on your side' I'm going to go ahead and stand right here and I'm going to protect you from attack and you can go to that person one-on-one you can say you know what I'm I'm going to pray for you I'm GNA pray not for you I'm going to pray with you I don't know about you but I've I've heard a lot of people tell me I'm GNA pray for you brother and it and it feels good I I appreciate those prayers but it's nothing like when somebody says you know what I'm going to pray with you let's pray right now I don't know about you but but sometimes I you know when you tell somebody something you say well I'll be praying for you I wonder I don't know if you've done it I've definitely been guilty but sometimes I've forgotten to pray about that and I wonder if maybe I just changed my behavior when somebody tells me something rather than say well you know what I'm going to pray for you brother how about we pray right now maybe you're on the phone with them maybe you're talking about over text or or email whatever it might be you know what let's pray right now over this thing rather than let's put it off until later and I think we have good intentions but you know we get busy and I've forgotten but I but if I see that weakness because we certainly see each other's weaknesses right we're human beings that's one of the things we're really good at is we're really good at seeing the weaknesses of somebody else sometimes not our own so good right but we definitely see the weaknesses of somebody else and I think that's actually for a purpose now I know this isn't a real big exciting message or anything but this to me this is what's on my heart we see those weaknesses and I think that the Lord allows us to see those because then we have a chance to prove really if we're a soldier in the army of the Lord because you could go out and fight a battle for yourself and that you know you're a soldier but do you have the shield see do you have a shield if you have a shield you're going to go and stand at your brother or your sister's vulnerable side and you're going to say no attack is going to get through here no attack of Satan is going to get through here and you know a lot of times the Lord has made made us dependent on one another for that exact thing because he's made you and he's made me and I have weaknesses and I think Lord why did you make me with those weaknesses and it maybe it's just so another brother or sister can find their place as a soldier next to me and say I'm going to protect this brother's weaknesses and when a whole congregation can do that that's right when a whole church can do that when a whole family can do that and you know we could we could limit it to these walls but I don't want to limit it to these walls cuz that's that's a little bit easy right well I love this brother and they're my family or they get along with me and I agree with them but how about the Christian who doesn't necessarily agree with you all the time I I don't know about you but it's a lot easier to see the weaknesses of somebody who doesn't agree with you right their weaknesses become even more apparent but guess what as a soldier in the army of the Lord it is your duty to go and cover their weakness now does that mean that we accept all wrongdoing no but neither does God accept our wrongdoing but that's not what I'm talking about I'm not talking about seeing something that's wrong and calling it right I'm talking about protecting them from an attack of the devil as the Lord heals them and works on them and changes them like I pray he's doing to you and I but sometimes we just need a shield up while we're trying to push through in prayer trying to hit our knees Lord I'm struggling this I'm battling with this and at the same time the devil's just hammering on you and I think it's I think it's our duty and I think really it should be our privilege it should be our desire to go and cover up our brother and our sister with our shield and it really will prove if you have that Shield or not and if if you find that you don't have the ability to cover up well guess what you have just found out what to pray for you've just found Lord I don't I might not have the shield Lord give me that shield and I'll tell you what Lord I'll use it I don't know where you're at but that's that's where I'm at if I find myself exposing my brother and sister's weaknesses and I just want to say that sometimes we do that and the way out of it is that we actually find a way that they're not a brother or a sister you know a lot of times when we start poting out somebody's mistake and we realize that we shouldn't be doing that then it's real easy to say well maybe they're not a Believer well they do believe this kind of crazy thing brother Aaron maybe they're not a brother and sister and see it's okay for me to do that right now that might just be a a slim major some of us just a slim margin but I know that's the case because I've struggled with that de christianizing somebody so that I can feel better about criticizing him and that that is not how a soldier operates that that's a that's a oneman army and I tell you a oneman army is going to fail that's not what we were made to be we were made to be a many membered body many membered body and when one part of the body hurts the whole body should hurt when one soldier even if it's somebody way over here that maybe you don't fellowship with that much or you don't know that much when they are being attacked the whole body should feel that attack and the whole body should shift and cover them until that healing can take place or a change can take place and so and a lot of times it's hard to do that because the soldier that's on your that's on your side they may not see the same view as you in fact hardly any of us think the same way we could all read the same message or hear the same message and you could ask somebody afterwards what did you think about that and you would get so many different perspectives of it right now now there isn't one right one because your perspective from your point of view is just as right as mine from my point of view man and and and I I actually don't even know what's on the uh the front of the pulpit because I came in from the backside there's a cross there no there isn't brother Aaron yeah see there's no cross on the pulpit I see some books and some water and a and a light and a microphone and you say there's a cross well you're off the word right it's it's a silly example but but that's exactly what we're guilty of a lot of times I know I am and yet if I were just to walk a mile in your shoes on your side I would see very clearly that there's a cross on the side of on the side of the pulpit and somebody come to you and say well you know brother Brown said this and this what it means no it doesn't you know the Bible says this and this is what I believe nope you're wrong this is what it means and and and I've been guilty of doing this it's the same thing and I have to realize that in order to protect my side I actually need a soldier who's facing the enemy a different way than I'm facing him you know because he's not always just going to come and and attack you on your front where you're strong actually he's rarely GNA do that he's GNA come and try to attack you on the side he's going to try attack you from the back and guess what I need Soldiers with a different perspective than me because they're facing this direction and they're guarding me who is right here against an attack that's coming on my side and if I go and tell that brother well you're wrong because you're looking at a the message or the Bible a different way than me I'm not I'm doing myself a disservice because that Soldier was placed there you were placed with your experience with your church with your ministers with your everything you were placed a certain way so that you can guard the body of Christ from a certain attack and don't let anybody take that away from you don't let anybody say oh well you know you're you have this certain vision and you're wrong in this say brother I'm facing the attack that I'm facing today and and Lord willing I'm protecting somebody from an attack because I'm strong when I'm facing this attack but they might not be strong because it might be hitting them on the side and Lord willing if I'm facing this way and and I just we don't see the same Lord willing you're protecting my side you're protecting me from an attack that I might not see coming if we have that mentality if we have that really in our hearts you know that we would be an Unstoppable Army we would be an invincible Army because we would be protected as the Bible says on all sides so even if your weaknesses which we have which I I believe I don't know about you I believe we're going to have those weaknesses until we're out of this body we're going to have those weaknesses so I don't think you can get stronger you can overcome but you're always going to have weaknesses and I think until until we're raptured out of here we're going to have and I need somebody to be protecting my weaknesses and I promise you I'll protect yours and if we could make that if we could have that attitude towards each other and not just the ones that we like not just towards the brothers and sisters we like but the ones that that really need protection I believe we would I believe it would change the Church of God I believe it would transform the Church of God into an invincible Army now I'm not telling you you don't do this I'm just I'm just preaching to you I just want to talk to you you cannot have if somebody comes to you and they have a different perspective you your reaction will tell you a lot whether you believe they're a soldier or not if if they tell you you have a different well we just I won't go into that but but it's it's it's important how we react to somebody who doesn't agree with us that's what I want to say it's important how you react to somebody who we believe the same thing but maybe they just have a different view of it and maybe it's because I'm not in position you know maybe that person we were talking about this with a brother last night and he said he was I I it was just it just kind of really touched me he said you know there was there was a little bit of doctrinal things going on in his church and he said he prayed to the Lord Lord why do I have this evil spirit on me that I can't see where my brothers are coming from have you ever prayed like that you know most of the time I pray Lord my brother's got an evil spirit on him you know why don't you help him to see my point of view right and we were talking about this and we were talking a few days ago I was talking with the same brother and I was you know you know know the the the the the message says that the right spirit will correct the wrong Doctrine amen we we we were familiar with this and and I'll just be honest with you this is a little bit of confession most of my life up until really really recently I thought okay if I'm going to go and I'm going to talk with a certain brother and we don't see eye to eye if I have the right Spirit there's a chance that his Doctrine could be corrected and then the Lord was just like like knocking on my head and I for the first time now maybe you all know this but for me it was a revelation if I have the right Spirit my Doctrine can be corrected see instead of me having the attitude of the right Spirit here we'll correct the wrong Doctrine there it's the right Spirit here if I'm willing to receive correction will correct the wrong Doctrine here and if my brother has that same attitude guess what we're both going to end up unified rather than me coming with the attitude well if I have the right spirit I I'm you're going to get some correction that that doesn't even sound right after you think about it that way but yet the natural part of us says man I just want to have the right spirit so that my brother or sister can be corrected in a loving way and a right way and I think our intentions are good but you see how just a simple shift of our mind and our hearts would change that scenario and you know somebody you might have you might have friends you might have family that you think are are a soldier and and I'm not here to tell you who is a soldier of God and who isn't but if somebody doesn't have a a shield and is on your side you have to be careful with that you have to be careful who you line up next to because I'm telling you you need to have Your Flank protected and you might have good good friends who have the best intention for you but if they don't have a shield in their hand that's not somebody you want to line up with now and I don't mean you have have to cut them off I don't mean you have to never talk to them again but I'm telling you when you go into battle don't rely on that person unless they have a shield in their hand to protect you amen I want to read a quote if that's okay with you he says in take on the whole armor of God he says in brother brandom 62 says now watch God doesn't have to do anything more to make it any more appealing the only thing he has to do is raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy when the Bible the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it what does he do he makes the word that he has already said now we've heard the word amen we have the word he makes the word that he's already said more positive he taking his same word and just making it more positive and and for me what does that mean that means the same exact word that you heard and said that's the truth that's the truth I don't know what I don't know what it is but that is the truth and I'm going to give my heart to the Lord you know that same exact word is the same word that you go defeat the Devil with you say well now okay now that I've given my heart to the Lord and now I'm coming to church I need to take on and and we we believe in learning we we believe in coming and hearing the word but now I need to take on this all this word in order to go defeat the Devil no it's the same exact word that you heard you can go and defeat the Devil with that same word that one that called you and called me out of sin is the same exact word you can take right to the devil and say no I have this word maybe I don't know all of the scripture maybe I don't know all the message but I know this because this spoke to me and I'm going to comat you with this and you know that that can beat the devil you said no you you have to have more than that no you don't need any more than that that is the word that's been revealed to you and so I I I can't stress that enough because I think sometimes as a especially as a new Christian we feel a little bit you feel overwhelmed by the amount of word that there is and how much you need to learn to go defeat the Devil when it's not that way you have been given the word of God because he called you out of Darkness not into a man's word not into a man's light not into a man's Church no he called you into his light into his word and if you understand a portion of his word you can take that portion and you can go defeat the Devil with it because you understand it and you believe it now is there more to learn yes there's more to learn is there more to believe yes there is but it's the same exact word and it won't contradict that maybe that you maybe you just have one little sentence that that called you out of sin you can take that sentence to the devil and you can defeat him that is the word word of God and and I just want to stress that because because a lot of times we lose battles because we don't believe we have enough of the sword of of the word of God to go strike the devil and I tell you you have it and it's not just this isn't just a feel-good message about it this is the word of God saying no no no you have it you have it yeah but I I brother I just no no no no you have it don't let this don't let the devil come in and tell you Oh no you're weak oh you're you know what you're just a new recruit and I I want to read you something you you got you got a moment here I want to read this to you he says this and hear ye him no I'm sorry in God's covenant with Abraham he says and he's talking about Jesus meeting Satan in the wilderness he says when he met Satan he never used any of his power you imagine that imagine that Jesus he act Satan comes from him and says you know you could turn these rocks into bread and Jesus could have done that he could have turned those rocks into bread but he says he never used any of his power listen now he proved Jesus proved that the weakest Christian could defeat Satan I don't know if that excites you but I I don't know what I could be maybe I know I'm not the strongest Christian brother Aron but I could be the weakest Christian I could be that you know I I could tell you all the things that I'm weak in I could tell you all the things I'm not good in but but I know that he saved me that I know he did I I know that he came and he spoke to me and I had an experience with him guess what you are now qualified to be minimum the weakest Christian that there is and guess what the weakest Christian this is right out of the message the weakest Christian can defeat Satan when Satan come to him and said now I want you're the Son of God you're a great miracle worker if you are I want you to perform a miracle here for me turn stones into bread and and Jesus could have used his power but he didn't he used the word amen he said it is written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God he defeated Satan on his own ground you know he went into Satan's territory and he defeated him on his territory with the word of God and he says and the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition thus th saith the Lord now you can take that amen and then he goes on to say you just believe it God said so don't now now if the next words out your mouth brother I don't know a lot that's I don't care about that that's not what he said he said you if you even consider yourself the weakest Christian are able to defeat the Satan anywhere anytime on any grounds under any condition now if you if you don't have anything else to hold on to hold on to that if you don't know a lot of the word you can know that word right there and you can cut that out and you can keep it right in front of you and when the when the devil attacks you because he certainly is going to attack you you can say you know what you're right you're right you're right I'm weak over here you're right I failed here you're right I'm not mentally strong I'm I'm not I'm not strong you're right but but I am the weakest Christian and I can defeat you and that will I guarantee you because it's the word of God will send him running because then he knows okay and he's going to come back and he's going to attack you again and what are you going to do take him to the word now he might quote work back to you like he did with Jesus you know what you do take back to this word amen let's let's move for I want to I want to talk about something if we could in Joshua if you could turn to Joshua maybe this is a little bit of a change but you know I I just personally I get so tired of the devil attacking Christians and and and him telling them that they're not strong enough to defeat him and I just feel like to stay right there if that's okay let's go to Joshua I got to find it myself here Joshua 10 and I don't know maybe we won't move off of that I just I just get so tired of the devil and it's not just for new Christians he does it with he does it with seasoned Christians he does it with everybody he comes in I don't know about you but he attacks by saying you know what you've been a Christian for 10 years 5 years 20 years and you still struggle with this you still struggle with that it's that same attack that he's attacking a new convert with oh you still have a problem look at brother so and so he doesn't struggle with that now he's showing you a Brother's strengths to try to deceive you that's what he does he'll and then by comparison you look at your weaknesses and you go oh I must not I must not be what I thought I was you know maybe I'm not able to handle this sword brother brandom says if he can get you to disbel believe the word he has disarmed you which tells me you were armed to begin with if you if he can get you it's in the greatest battle of her fought you can read he says about four or five times if he can get you to disbelieve one word and he goes and he said eve he says he got her to disbelieve one word and he goes right there she was disarmed now I know sometimes you don't feel like you're like you're a soldier right maybe you don't feel even like you're a good Christian or not maybe you don't feel like you're a Believer I don't know sometimes I feel like I'm a make believer just with some of the mistakes that I make and Lord I'm trying but here I go and I do this and here I think this thing and here I say this thing that I don't want to say and then the devil will come and oh you're just yeah you're trying but you're just one of those make Believers and if you stop and you listen to that he disarms you and now you're in trouble because now attacks are going to start to work because you've been disarmed but I'm going to read something to you in a minute here where even his attacks are lies even his attacks are bluffs in Joshua 10 verse1 15 might seem like a strange verse to read but this is Joshua coming back from a battle he's coming back from a battle he says Joshua return verse 15 of chapter 10 and all Israel with him under the camp to gilgal five Kings escaped this battle and they fled and they hid themselves in a cave and it was told to Joshua saying the five kings are found in a cave at M Mada and and Joshua says to paraphrase and to save time he says roll these Stones up upon the cave and just just leave them in there for a little while as the young people would say my son would know let him cook just just just let them let them let them sit there for a little while and they actually go and have a whole another battle and defeat a whole another Army and then after the battle he comes back and he says in verse 22 okay now open the mouth of the cave and bring out those kings and they did so and brought forth five Kings them out of the Cave the king of Jerusalem Hebron jarmuth lashus and eglon I hope I said those right and it came to pass they brought out those King under Joshua and I love this now he called for the Warriors the ministers right he called for the apostles and the prophets that's not what my Bible says he called for the men of Israel you know who he called for congregation come over here well brother I I just I just got here I just got saved yep come over here well brother I i' I've been in I've been in the message for many years I've but I I'm not a preacher I'm not a warrior I'm I'm a I'm a good yep come over here well you know but I I failed a lot yeah I got weaknesses I I I I struggle in my prayer life I struggle overcoming yep come over here that's what he's telling them called for all the men of Israel and then he said unto the captains of Men of War which went with him come near and put your feet on the necks of these Kings and they came near and put their feet upon the necks and he said unto them fear not because I think a lot of times we don't defeat the enemy because we're afraid of the enemy and we're afraid that we're not Mighty enough to defeat him and if you went off of your feelings that would be true but we're not asked to go off of our feelings we're asked to go by the word of God that and you know when it says under any conditions you can defeat the Devil I think the condition that most keeps us is fear it's these conditions that keep me from defeating the enemy sometimes it's nothing that's external but my own fears my own thoughts my own doubts my own doubts about myself keep me from fighting the devil and defeating him but I love this now it's one thing if Joshua would have went and and killed these Kings everybody would have been like well it's Joshua of course he's going to kill them right it can I just say this I hope it doesn't offend but if brother Branham goes and slays the enemy none of us would be surprised that's the prophet of God and he goes and he casts out demons in a prayer line he goes and calls this and we can say Amen to that but brother bram's trying to get a point across this to say no no wait a minute it the weakest of you can defeat this devil the same way and it's in the Bible Joshua says okay now I can kill these Kings and you could say man what a what a mighty warrior Joshua is but he says no no you come over here and you put your foot on the neck of this King that held you down on the neck of this enemy who who who enslaved you who was over here you put your foot on the neck and he says and be not afraid he says fear not nor be made be strong and of good courage for thus the Lord shall do to all your enemies whom who fights you if we are waiting for I think I know I think you know what I mean when I say this but if we're waiting for a Ministry to go and fight our battles for us we are going to lose we are going to lose the minister is an important part of of a congregation but they are a servant to to the people there is a people individual people in here that must go and fight their battle someone else cannot overcome your battle for you I can protect your flank you can protect mine but you have some overcoming to do and guess what when you when you when you go forward not with the not because you're strong and because you're good and because you're just you're a powerful work no no no you just go forward with a simple word of God that says the weakest Christian can defeat Satan guess what when you go into battle with that you are going to win you might get hit you might get wounded you might get injured but you are going to win and it's not my word it's the word that's telling you that thus the Lord do to all your enemies against whom you fight and afterward Joshua smote them and slew them he said let me show you exactly how do you do it and you imagine a mighty I don't know about I don't know if you could picture this but imagine just a mighty warrior king who had power over you power over people and to see him laying on the ground with a foot on his neck guess what even a child could come up and kill him even a child in the in the word could come up and slay him why because he's been defeated already and this I'm going to tell you all this has already been done this is exactly brother what you just said if he would have died and went to the Grave it'd be a sad day but when he Rose when he rose he put his foot on the neck of the enemy that holds you and in and this entire time all the things you battle all the things I battle he's standing right there with his foot on the neck of that enemy saying come over here oh Lord I don't feel strong enough I know you're going going to feel strong after this you're going to feel Mighty after this because I've already done the work for you but I want you to come and I want you to kill this enemy and he says and he slew them and hang them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening this is not just for ministers this is for you this is not just for the prophet of God who we believe in this is for you to do he went ahead and BL BL a trail what's the point of Blazing a trail if nobody's going to walk on that trail he went ahead and made a way where God was making a way through a man but he made a way so you and I could walk on that same path and those same enemies that seemed insurmountable well they seem like nothing when you see them defeated and I want to tell you that the enemy is under your foot you say it's one thing to picture him under Jesus's foot but he's actually under your foot why well where does where is Jesus right well where is Jesus at he doesn't have a as far as I know he doesn't have this a physical foot that he has down in the neck no he has my foot he has your foot I'm not strong enough to Shield you but if Jesus is here then that Shield holds up amen I'm not strong enough to defeat the Devil but if I have him now I'm at least the weakest Christian at the very least I'm the weakest Christian and and and he's trying to but he's trying I know how he works he's trying to disarm you even right now he's trying to disarm you you say that sounds good but but you don't know what I struggle with if you knew the things I struggle with I'm G tell you this I've seen it all and there's nothing that the Lord can overcome and I want to go a step further I've seen it all and there's nothing that you cannot overcome the weakest Christian with the most weaknesses the most failures the most battles can defeat the devil on any ground and any time on any condition that's not my word that's the word if it was mine you know you might not be able to take that to the bank brother Aaron but you can take the word to the bank but he wants to convince you that that's not true and uh there was another there's another quote he says and I want you to remember this this is for the weakest Christian that there is in the building you don't have to have gifts I was going to say that again you do not have have to have gifts you don't have to wait until some person comes by who prays for the sick he says and I'll go on record because there's a tape recorder taking it here and I'll say this and we know this I think we know this quote the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can get the right mental attitude towards that promise let's let's let's go over to another scripture here in Genesis doing it right on time okay I always tell myself I'm going to look at the clock and then it's right in front of me and I always forget I genuinely forget I I apologize let's go over to Genesis 14 I want to maybe just on on on the on the change turn a little bit of a corner but I want to just talk about practical application of this that's one thing to hear you can do it and it's another thing to go do it right I think most of the time we we leave church I mean I hope I hope so anyways we leave church feeling pretty good sometimes you're a little bit sometimes the Lord comes and you know scour you out a little bit and cleans out but overall I think we we leave church feeling I I hope we do encouraged and we we leave church feeling like I'm goingon to go do this right and then I would say Monday morning but sometimes Sunday afternoon hit you right in the face right sometimes right on the way home it hits you and the thing that you just heard and the thing that you just learned you forget to apply it and then Satan comes and goes see you're not a soldier see that message wasn't for you you're weak what are you going to do what are you gonna do take him back to the word I know it sounds it sounds cliche but if that's the weapon you've been given then use it if that's the weapon I've been given then use the weapon you might be you might be clumsy with it not everybody just picks up a sword and knows how to swing it skillfully and block you might be terrible at it but but that sword can defeat him yeah you don't have to be eloquent you don't have to know exactly where the quote is or where the scripture you just say you know what this is what I heard today I heard that I could be I am weak you know what you're right I am weak but I could still defeat you and that might seem clumsy that might seem awkward guess what and I'll read it to you he's afraid of somebody who wields a sword like that because they are somebody who's coming into their position as a soldier maybe they haven't fought a 100 battles but it only takes one battle to defeat him and over here in Genesis let's read in 14 I read about we we talked about these five Kings over here I want to read about four more Kings and I just thought this was really interesting because of I don't think there's any coincidences in the Bible I think even your name matters and I just went into a little bit of a study on what the the names of some of these Kings meant and it was like it just the Bible just opened up to me verse um Genesis 14 we'll start with verse 9 and I I know I want to keep you so I'm going to skip a few verses here verse 9 now I'm I'm I'm going to admit I don't know how to pronounce most of these names so if you forgive me for a lot of things one of them is going to be my pronunciation of them but cedor Lor is how I would say that the king of Elum with tidle the king of Nations amrel the king of shinar and arot king of elisar Four Kings with the five verse 12 and they took took lot Abraham's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and they departed and I love this scripture in verse 14 now I know this I just point this out because it's really simple but Abraham's brother's son what would that what is lot to him his nephew right Abraham's brother's son but yet in verse 14 when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive see lot was no longer his nephew you know what lot was he was a soldier right next to him my brother has been taken my sister has been taken we have some we we need to get out of this I say we me included but just I I see this in so many churches we need to get out of the attitude of my church my group my congregation no no no no if someone else across town or across a state or another state has been taken by the enemy if you're you're a soldier of God you will say no no my brother's been taken my sister's been taken and I'm not just going to let that slide I'm not anybody I'm not Mighty but you know what that's not going to happen because I'm a soldier and they're a soldier and and I've swore an oath to serve under a commander and so have they and guess what that makes us equal maybe I'm maybe I'm a 10-year veteran and they're they're a new convert maybe I'm a new convert and they're a 20-year veteran in the army they cannot be taken without me going and pursuing that enemy and again if we have that mentality where Church boundaries don't matter and church attendance don't matter I'm just going to say it because I know it's true when those things stop mattering anymore and all of our doctrines that we have when they don't matter anymore and we can look across to a Believer and say you're a soldier and I'm a soldier I have weaknesses and you have weaknesses which means I can be wrong and am wrong and you are wrong if if we both can recognize that I got my shield and I'm going to go stand next to you and guess what if I'm standing next to you with my shield I believe that God's going to provide someone else to come and stand next to me sure I could call up brother Aaron and I could tell you all about it brother Aaron oh you know brother so and so this and you know what he believes but instead I could go and put a shield up next to you and if we do that worldwide it's an Unstoppable Army and I going to tell you this I believe the bride will do that it's not just a hopeful I hope that we do this I hope we no no I believe that God is training and pushing and showing us exactly how to do that because that's the kind of bride he's going to Rapture he's not going to Rapture a bride who is disjointed who doesn't doesn't get now do we have to agree in everything I can guarantee you that we all in this room don't agree 100% on everything and yet we're sitting here right yet we're brothers and sisters we're not going to agree upon everything but if I know despite maybe something I disagree with you I'm going to stand right next to you and my Shield's up and maybe sometimes our disagreements are just a different perspective right that thing that I'm so sure that I'm right on no there is not a cross on the front of this Pulpit that thing that I just I know I know I know God might put me in a situation probably against my will let's be honest that drags me around to where I can see things from your point of view and vice versa let's read about these Four Kings these these Four Kings now now now he goes on in in in 14 he says and when Abraham heard they took the brother captive he armed who his Warriors nope you know what he took servants train servants brother guess what I can be that I can be a servant I don't consider myself one of these these powerful ministers I don't consider myself an apostle or an Evangel I could be a trained servant I can do that I could be the weakest Christian that's who he took born in his own house 318 and pursued them under Dan and he divided himself against them him and his servants by night and smoke them and he brought back all the goods and also brought back again his brother lot and his goods and his women also and the people when when you go up against the devil when you go to rescue somebody guess what you get everything back there is not a single thing that the devil is entitled to I I don't care what it is you know a lot of times we we we'll give up something to well you know the devil he gets his shot in the devil's not entitled to anything he's not entitled to your goods he's not entitled I want to tell you this he's not entitled to your thoughts he's not entitled to those well we live in a body of Flesh I I I I recognize that I recognize we're humans but he's not entitled to those things and you don't need to give that territory to him he's not entitled to your time your thoughts your money your fellowship your prayer he's not entitled to any of those things and when God when you have a revelation of that drop and you go after the enemy you realize no no no I'm going to take back my time that you've been taken up I'm going to take back my thoughts that you've been taken up I'm going to take that back my family oh well they're not Believers I don't care if they're Believers you're not entitled to them I'm going to take them back that's right oh your own weaknesses I'm sorry but you're not not entitled to those those are mine that's right I know this is I know maybe this is just basic but I tell you this is where the devil tricks us he tricks us into thinking oh no those belong to me and so if they belong to me I have a little peace in your life no you don't have a peace in my life you don't have any territory in my land it's my land it was given to me my family they're my family you don't have a place in there well you know there they have weaknesses I don't care I'm the weakest Christian and I can send you running and Abraham here we could say a lot of things about lot right we could say a lot of things about him if you read his read his life but Abraham said oh no you don't get anything of lots you don't get you don't get his family you don't get his Goods you don't get his land you get nothing I'm taking it all back and these Kings and I just want to go into this and we're we'll we'll close on this but these Kings this first one it says his name is tidal I'm not going to have these in any particular order but I wanted to go into what they mean because I want you to know how the enemy attacks you which I'm sure you know but may maybe just a reminder this word this this King his name means fearfulness now I want you to know the enemy that not only has already been defeated but but but your foot your foot is on his neck he's already been defeated fearfulness that's what his name means and that's one of the greatest weapons that the devil has against us is fear and and and it's again it goes back to that if he can get you to disbelieve if he can get you to fear he's disarming you um brother R says this there's many that pretend to be in there there's many Waring themselves anybody ever feel like that everybody feel like the greatest enemy you have is you I think if we're human beings that's probably how we feel there's many that's Waring themsel and trying to live right and trying to press in he says but if they're in there it's just as easy to live a Christian Life as it is to live any life because you're in Christ and nothing else but the full of the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you and direct you and sure you'll make mistakes yes sure you'll make mistakes and fall but you can't stay down no more than you can make a stock of corn into a sycamore tree you can't do it Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them you have everlasting life and one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear Everybody's scared to death what's going to happen who and what and Jesus said even when the fearful sights come lift up your head and rejoice for great your Redemption is drawing nigh when these things happen like we see in this day and age and he says in Divine love and Sovereign Grace the reason you're fearful is because the right Temperance of love has never entered yet you think that the way to combat fear is Cur courage but he says the way to combat fear is love love for my brother and sister although I see their weaknesses in spite of me seeing their weaknesses when there is real love all fear passes away that's what he says and I and I don't know where I heard this from it might have been from um I think it was in discussion we were at up in Flag step but Be not Afraid is in the Bible 365 times one for every day brother Aaron every single day there is a new scripture with Be not Afraid in it which to me is just it's it's a it's a it's a fulfillment of his Mercy is new every morning and God whenever he even in this scripture Joshua is saying hey come over here don't be afraid don't be afraid and I I thought about this if Satan can inflict you with fear we can agree that he could do that then where does where does Fear come from from him if fear comes from the devil that tells me he's afraid if he can try to put fear onto you now I know this might see so simplistic and maybe just but think about it if the devil has the ability to put fear on you then he has fear what he's trying to do is just trying to get you to take on his fear you to take on his fear because listen he knows the word and he knows what his end is he knows what his end is and guess what though he is afraid of that end I don't care what he says he's afraid of his end and what he wants to do is he wants to put his fear on you so that you're afraid and he gets a little bit of Peace but he doesn't have any peace and and all these scriptures all these quotes should be reinforcing the fact that you put fear into Satan he is afraid of the weakest Christian he is afraid of a trained servant in the house of a mighty man he's it's not even the Mighty Man a trained servant in the house of the mighty man he's afraid of him that's you that's me at least now I'm not I don't know where you're at and maybe you're mightier than that but I tell you I can be the weakest Christian I can be that and and he just brother Ram says this I'm trying to hurry and close here he says regardless of how little we are so so if you thought you were little you can just throw that out regardless of how little we are or how low we are or how impure we are or how Unholy we are how sick we are or how Afflicted we are that should cover everything right there the law of God's spirit Spirit by his word makes it obey him and forces the issue and says give it back and if we could just think about that for a minute it forces it regardless of the condition no matter what the condition is the law of God's word forces the condition to cope with its word with his word it's got to this this other king chador LaMore his me his name means the one who binds you and I don't know about I don't know your life I don't know about you I don't know you personally but I know that people are bound with a lot of things and we just start just right at the obvious ones addictions we're bound a lot of times by addictions and when I mean bound means we feel powerless against them we feel like they control us not we control them that's what that's this King he literally represents that thing that binds you and the problem is is that that King has been killed it's been killed already so the thing that binds you is already dead and defeated what does it take to to realize that is that we need to be trained we need to be trained servants and in order to be trained servants we need to spend time in the word the word and the message is not it's not just for a minister to study if you're relying on the minister to study the word for you and to preach you the word you're not doing your due diligence as a soldier every one of us should be in this word being a trained servant and that way you know when when maybe the a minister or the pastor something says you know I need I need some I need a couple people to go and pray with me guess what you've been training I'm not saying you're going to be Mighty but you could be the weakest Christian you say you know what I I've been training a little bit and I'm not anything great but I I know enough to keep the devil running I'm going to go with you and I'm going to pray but do we train every day do we prepare do we spend time in prayer I I had to ask myself the same thing and and sometimes I don't like that answer but we have to we have to prioritize that and God said he says this he says I believe the most important thing in any life is to entertain Jesus Christ properly in the first place in your worship first place in your life first place in Everything Jesus Christ deserves that place I believe with all my heart but if you don't he'll take second place he'll go down in the basement with you if you're ashamed of him when you go among the people and you go down in the basement to see him he'll still come that ought to make you love him above everything else in the world Jesus in second place Jesus in fourth place in 10th place but he'll still come when you invite him and see I think what it is is sometimes we're not bound by Satan we're Bound by ourself we're Bound by ourself and I I I I don't just talk about addictions we're Bound by our religion we're Bound by our our uh whether it be cold and formal and starchy or on fire screaming and running sometimes we're Bound by our own religion if you don't believe it like this oh you're guess what you're binding yourself to a religion well if you don't just believe it the way I believe if you don't worship like oh if you don't if if you get up and shout there's something wrong with you if you don't get up and shout there's something wrong with you we're binding ourself by our own thoughts and our own religion and our own know really it's our own it's our own religion it's not God's religion it's our own idea of what church should be and and you know he says brother BR says in both places that just because you jump and shout and make a lot of noise doesn't mean you have it we we all read that and then he says in other places if the spirit moves through the congregation and you sit still it means there's no life in you so I don't have to take one and throw out the other one I can take both I can take both and I tell you that sounds really simple but that's that is the battle you want to know what the battle is in our time is to be in the middle of the road it's to be able to take this side and this side and come into the middle and I believe that was brother bram's purpose his ministry he even said he goes you Brothers over here and you Brothers over here you actually believe the same thing and you don't even know it he goes and what I have been sent here to do is to grab you by the hand and grab you by the hand and join you in the middle as a unified church and and we we hear unified church and immediately think oh that's the the World Council of churches you know that's just an imitation of what the bride will be doing say there is going to be a unified Church of the world but that's only he he can't create that's not his idea he can only pervert what he knows is going to happen anytime you see that happening oh well then there must be a genuine dollar bill if there's a counterfeit dollar bill out there if the world is uniting together against the church guess what the church is going to be United and we we're going to come from all different backgrounds and all different thoughts and all different doctrines and some might see a cross and some might see no cross but if we unite together and if you have the Holy Spirit guess what you don't have a choice I hate to say that but if you have the Holy Ghost living inside of your heart the Holy Ghost isn't going to disagree with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost isn't going to disagree with the word and that that's what I want I don't want it to be up to me brothers and sisters if it's up to me I'm going to fail I'm going to tell you what to do and if it's up to this flesh I'm going to go out and it won't be a day or a week from now be like ah brother so and so sister but the Holy Ghost if I let that govern my life if I let that take over that does the work for me it's the surrender that we have to do as a soldier you got time for you got time for two more we got five minutes brother arok says this other king like a lion I love this because that is the definition of his name like a lion but he is not a lion he's like one the Bible says I don't want to misquote it but the Bible says he's going around roaring as a lion what does that tell you he is he's a bluff even when he attacks you he doesn't have power he operates through fear through your own your own knowledge of your own weaknesses and he gets you to give him power that's what he does he doesn't have power he's on the ground with your foot on his neck but if he can just convince you to just lift up that foot a little bit and give him back some life give him back some power he says this brother brandom Witnesses that's the way the devil will do he'll let you build up a little bit of something and then come and knock the props out from under you and the reason is you let them do it there's just nothing like the word of God because he just calls it what it is you let him do it he's just a bluff and he has no legal right he says if you've got an experience of God of the resurrection of Jesus Christ then he strips Satan of every privilege that he has and robbed him of everything he had took it away from him yes sir he robbed him and stripped it and gave the power it doesn't say to the ministry it doesn't say to the prophet although we believe in those things he says he gave the power to the church you have the power to defeat Satan now go do the same things I did he says that's right he took the sword out of Satan's hand and put it in your hand you know you fight a devil that has no sword oh brother he knows the word you know he knows the letter real well he knows this letter better than you and better than I and you could pick up a message book and he knows that better than you I but he doesn't have the word because it takes the Holy Spirit to make this the word without the holy spirit this is not life this is death but if you have the Holy Spirit it quickens this word and and he doesn't have the ability to place the word where it belongs he goes and does battle with Jesus in the wilderness and he's quoting the word to him but he doesn't know where to place it he's taking word out of out of Psalms and he's saying oh surely if you're cast down the angels will sweep you up and Jesus is like you don't even know what you're talking about it's also written and he takes them to the word amen that's the way it is every time a good meeting started some hypocrite will come in and say days and miracles has passed might as well stop this he says that's the devil anytime you get the church going good somebody slips in and says oh that's just all enthusiasm that's just worked up that's fanaticism that's the way they do it same old robbers old Philistines coming right back that's exactly right and he's talking about shamgar in this which I I just love that story because shamgar is a perfect picture of you and I that we don't maybe think much of oursel right we don't think we're this Great Mighty Warrior shamgar was a farmer and he just got tired of year after year after year the Philistines coming in he says his righteous indonation got up here they were big heavy armor what did he do he says I'm an Israelite you know what he was saying I'm the weakest Soldier I could be at least that in other words he's like he says right here I'm not a warrior I'm not a fighter and there's nothing I can do but I know one thing that God's with me that's all I know and he reached up and got an old Ox goat a stick with a piece of brass on it and he jumped out there under the power of God of the Holy Ghost knowing he had the right and slew 600 Philistines and that last one is that last king is the one who accuses you and I know he does this he says you're not forgiven I mean you I don't I don't know if he tells you that you're weak you're worthless you're not strong God hasn't forgiven you God doesn't hear your prayer how about you you're sick because you deserve to be sick you're bound by addiction because you deserve to be bound by that addiction you fall down and you fail because God isn't with you you're suffering because of you um you're no good you're a s I'll just go go down the list you're a sinner you're a failure you don't have enough Faith you're not in the bride you don't deserve forgiveness God doesn't hear you God doesn't see you God doesn't know you that's the accuser and and when presented with this Jesus says when the woman is brought to him caught in the very Act of sin he asks her a question he says Where have your accusers gone why because he had already defeated them with what the word and he looked around and he says and I don't accuse you either and I didn't I didn't have this this I had this quote written down maybe a few weeks ago but it but when we when I was hearing that testimony sister Martha just it just came to my mind he says he defeated Satan on the word of God and it shows no matter what you can defeat Satan on the word of God it'll defeat him any place anywhere in any condition if it's in the belly of the whale or if it's in a lion's den or if it's laying on a bed with cancer weeks ago sister Marth I had this written down if it's laying on a bed with cancer or if it's laying Yonder bleeding to death the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere and the weakest Christian can use it because it's your god-given privilege to use it amen God bless [Applause] you amen thank you for the the extra time I appreciate that I I actually don't know how long I went but I'm sure it was more than I more than I was allotted so we appreciate it bless you
