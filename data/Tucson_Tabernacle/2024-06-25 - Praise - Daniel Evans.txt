she says I would like to give praise to God about two weeks ago I was going through a hard trial and was asking God to help me through the trial at the same time I was praying at the same time I was praying God showed someone what I was going through so they could pray for me God helped me through the trial God is so good I can't praise him enough I also thank God for Christians I like that part sister Shirley he can I like God I thank God for Christians that he can use when we are in need brothers and sisters we are a body that body is knit together and there are different parts of that body and each part is vitally important brother Jeremy was running around and he and he hid his his knee and his finger and all of a sudden that knee and that finger became the most important part of his body because it was in pain 1 Corinthians 12: 26 says when one member of the body suffers the entire body suffers and that's with sister Shirley she's giving praise that that the Lord used somebody else to help her and reveal that to that person at that same time that she was suffering and then they were able to pray about these things and worked it out amen doesn't it feel good to be in this

about the word I um I'm just so blessed the Lord Jesus is so good to us let's let's bow our heads for just a moment father we invite your presence once again Lord that now that we have worshiped father and Lord as we read a little bit of your word and talk about your word I pray that you would also be with us tonight in Jesus name amen you can take your seats bu can I have that M there's something there is just there's something about praising the Lord that there there's really there's nothing like it we can we can preach the gospel and you can you can learn something but then there is a time also for worship and the lord loves to be worshiped and he loves to be worshiped through song and praise and and I mentioned this last night at our meeting and it's very important when we are listening to music whether it be in our car and our at home and our earbuds wherever it might be music was designed to worship and as you are listening to to the music that you're listening to or you're singing along you are worshiping and I ask you what are you worshiping as you're listening to the music and singing along the Lord has given us music and the devil so often he has taken music and he perverts it and he turns it into something that worships him and looks at him so brothers and sisters music is is vitally vitally important I gave that I talked about that last night and we had some visitors and uh there was there was three uh Mormon missionaries that were there and after our service they they wanted to talk and and we had a really nice conversation and uh the one that was kind of the leader in the group he said hey I wanted to tell you what you said about worship and about listening to music he said uh he said sir he said I fall short there he says I never thought about that and then both of the other ones these are good boys both of the other ones said the same thing I know I know I do too and we had it started a really nice conversation with them and I told them they they said well why are you why are you here what's your story and I gave a little bit of of my history and I said you know I said one of the biggest things with me was that I saw that there was many times preaching a narrative or preaching a what a church thinks rather than genuinely seeking God and seeking what he wants instead of just preaching what my church says or or what a certain book says but Lord what do you have for me to do what is right in my life and what would you like me to say and I said that's the reason I said I got I got really discouraged and as I was talking I knew who I was talking to as I was talking to these young men one of them he bowed his head and I could see that it was starting to get through and he knew what I was talking about the one he was like oh yeah yeah that's that's good and the other one took what I was saying and he applied it to his own life and he and he stopped talking and the other two would talk and this young man he he wouldn't he wouldn't say anything else and I could I could see that he applied this to the LDS church and how they are going out not necessarily to win souls but to win converts to their church and brothers and sisters we need to be careful that we are not doing the same thing we are not trying to win a convert to the Tucson Tabernacle or to anything else what we are trying to do is introduce someone to the Lord Jesus Christ that is the most important thing it's in every Epistle of the New Testament everyone without without exception that is the motive behind them and if if we truly have the Holy Spirit of God that is what we are going to do and many times that witness can come through just worship just songs sister Rachel I I heard secondhand a testimony that you gave how you had something on your heart was it you and then brother Josiah sang the song and it gave you the answer if that's true raise your hand it was a song didn't necessarily have to be the minister up here reading the Bible and breaking down the Scriptures it was music it was praise it was it was adoration to the Lord Jesus and it gave an answer we should always have such high expectation of what the Lord can do in a worship service come expecting it's not just oh this person I like this person singing or or I like the way that this sister plays the piano or the brother on the guitar or whatever it is no I want to come and I Lord I Want To Praise You I Want To Worship you and that was what our meeting was about last night that Lord we just want to praise you we can set aside any differences or any doctrines they don't matter anyways what matters is that we know our Lord and we know our Savior Jesus Christ there's a story about a king in the Bible his name is Jehoshaphat and we all know the famous story of Jehoshaphat and Ahab and Ahab brought 400 prophets to Jehoshaphat he asked he said have you josaphat asked him he said would you like to go to war with us and and or Ahab asked josph that and josph had respond and said hey we're brothers I'm Jud and you're Israel we were once perfectly together we're still Brothers yes but let's seek the Lord's will on this and Ahab says I have 400 men of God prophets of god let's bring them down there and they were all in one Accord but there was something about this man Jehoshaphat it's it didn't seem quite right he says don't you have just one more and then there was mcka mcka J Ahab hated him and he said go on up go to battle but if you return at all God didn't speak to me prophesied of the death of this King and I always wondered they went to battle I always wondered why did josa go why did he why did he go and fight with this man Ahab and they went to battle and you know the story Ahab got killed in the battle he was shot an Archer just pulls up and shoots wasn't even aiming at anything and there Arrow comes down and goes in between a and ahab's armor and kills him I always wondered why did he go to battle but maybe the question is why didn't I read the next chapter the Bible's wonderful so what happened was josaphat went back home went back came back home safely got out of the battle and he probably thought he was doing pretty good and then a prophet came to Jehoshaphat and he says something very strange to him he says he says should you help the ungodly and love them that hate the Lord therefore is right wrath upon thee from before the Lord 2 Chronicles chapter 19 says that so then Jehoshaphat he gets this word from this prophet and he says we got to do something about this so he goes and he starts what we would call in today's in today's U vernacular in today's language he goes and he starts preaching the gospel across Judah and he starts encouraging the people to get closer to the Lord come out of the world get closer to the Lord and and let's let's put our lives behind God loving the Lord then after he did that he hears word that there were armies forming against him and against Judah these were not just armies these were overwhelmingly powerful armies and there's no way that Judah could ever survive this Jehoshaphat doesn't know what to do and he says to the people he says fast and pray he says brothers and sisters we are about to lose our kingdom we're about to lose our homes this Army that is is coming out of inti brother Li I believe it's it's uh it's southeast of Jerusalem this Army that's forming down there is is massive and it's going to come against us and we have nothing to do we need God people start praying and then a very unlikely Source gave a prophecy from god let's turn to 2 Chronicles chapter 20 verse 15 in this man that gave the prophecy it wasn't a king it wasn't the prophet that had just spoken this man named juu this was a different man you know who it was it was a song leader it was a worship leader that gave this prophecy this was a man who was filled with the holy spirit that loved the Lord and then God came down through this worship leader and says these words 2 Chronicles chapter 20 we'll start with verse 15 and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus sayeth the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but is God's tomorrow go ye down against them remember this is this is an unconquerable army that's coming against them they had no chance but he says go down against them behold they come up by the Cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jeru you shall not need to fight in this battle I'm in 2 Chronicles 20: 17 now ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord with you when you love to hear a prophecy like that oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of the coites and the children of the kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high they were worshiping they were praising the Lord the battle hadn't even started yet and they were already praising the Lord for the victory because they had word from God and they Rose early in the morning and they went forth forth Into the Wilderness of tocoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so believe in the Lord your God so shall ye be established believe as prophets and so shall you prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that should that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever so Jehoshaphat this great king this great warrior he receives word that the battle is the Lord's and it's not yours and brother he sends out not The Archers not the calvary not the footman he sends out the piano player he sends out the guitar player he sends out the singer he sends out the symbol player and he sends them before these great warriors and they start praising the Lord and they start singing and you got to wonder what these Warriors thought wow these little guys and here they go out before this Army that was before them and they're singing and they're praising just like we were doing today sister hope we're singing We're praising we're loving the Lord and that's what they're doing they're out there just thanking God singing how important is it to praise him to love him and to sing praises to Him and they go they go down and what they didn't know is over here the Lord had ordained another Army that nobody knew about it wasn't from Judah it wasn't from Israel it was for someone else and then this Army comes out and starts fighting with this other Army and here's the singers and they're praising and they're singing and they're playing and they're going and they're fighting and killing each other all these other people and then once they're done then the army that I was just talking about this big one then they get all scared and they start fighting each other and every man every Warrior was killed so here comes the army of Jerusalem they come down and all they see is dead bodies they don't see there's not a there's nobody to fight and it's because the worshippers went forward if the musicians could get ready and what I want to do is I want to give us a little taste of we what we had last night with our musicians and and playing and singing and that's what happened here is the worshippers went out and and as I said don't ever underestimate the power of worship worship it's wonderful when things get hard I Praise Him amen when things when I get all turned around when I get sick I praise and brother Jeremy back at this when when I talked to him before I came out here he was praising God not because he got hurt but he was praising God that that the Lord protected him and can you imagine how the worshippers they go out before the before the the Army and they're praising and here comes the Army and you know what happened even if you couldn't sing you started praising you started singing you started praising you started thanking God for his goodness and that same God that was back there with the King Jehoshaphat is the same God that is here and he is the same one that we worship today that's right bring him out of History yes sir Lord you are alive you're great you're wonderful you are the almighty God and you have already won the battle amen you won the battle brother ly he won the battle on the cross that battle there was no more battles after that he went on this cross and he died and he destroyed death hell in the grave and then he raised up in the power of the Resurrection in the power of the Holy Spirit and then it's so wonderful that my sins were forgiven that day but you know what he promised he promised oh yeah and by the way that same spirit that Rose Jesus Christ from the grave in Acts chapter 2 is the same spirit that is promised to us amen so we praise him for it praise the Lord amen he is wonderful it's the same Spirit The Same Spirit that was with Jehoshaphat The Same Spirit that was with Paul and Silas when they started singing and the the gates of of the prison threw open and they walked out it's the same God and it's he can be contacted through praise amen amen so we're going to sing [Music]
