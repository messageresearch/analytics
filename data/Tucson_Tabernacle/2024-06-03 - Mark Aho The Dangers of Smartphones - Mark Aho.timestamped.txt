[11:06] [Music]
[11:12] let's let's all stand for a minute and
[11:15] we can open in
[11:20] prayer our heavenly
[11:23] father Lord we count on an honor when we
[11:25] can come together whether it be to
[11:28] worship on Sunday morning or whether it
[11:31] be something like this where we come
[11:34] here
[11:35] to understand Lord the world a little
[11:37] bit more that
[11:39] is the Lord Jesus commanded us to be
[11:43] wise as serpents but harmless as doves
[11:46] and father we pray that today that we
[11:49] could learn something that would help us
[11:52] through this life that father that we
[11:55] would be able to keep an eye out always
[11:57] for the enemy because we know know that
[12:00] he's always there lurking and trying to
[12:03] get his way with us father we pray that
[12:06] your blessings would be upon each person
[12:09] upon the speaker as he talks to us about
[12:13] these perils that that face us every day
[12:16] and Lord most of all that you would be
[12:19] glorified in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[12:22] amen you can be
[12:25] seated this um this presentation brother
[12:28] Josiah sent it to me uh a couple weeks
[12:31] ago and uh his dad brother Mark gives um
[12:36] gives a really nice testimony of the
[12:40] perils that face us every day in on the
[12:43] internet and on um these devices that we
[12:46] have whether it be a computer or whether
[12:48] it be a um a smartphone or or a
[12:52] tablet and I would just like to share as
[12:55] as we get started I would just like to
[12:58] share a couple test
[12:59] testimonies this happened actually
[13:02] brother Josiah told it to me
[13:04] today he's selling a
[13:07] vehicle and he gets a call on this
[13:11] vehicle and when did it happen yes where
[13:14] did you say
[13:15] yesterday what happened this morning and
[13:18] it's it's amazing I believe this is
[13:19] fortuitous that we're here and we're
[13:22] going to be talking about what just
[13:23] happened to Josiah so this person texts
[13:27] him and says I'm
[13:33] here they said they were interested in
[13:35] the car and like maybe asked one
[13:39] question and then said uh send a code to
[13:43] know that you're legit and you're not a
[13:46] scammer so they're trying to say so we
[13:49] know that you're real and then uh so a
[13:52] code pops up and it was a Google
[13:54] verification code that ex specifically
[13:57] said don't share this code with anyone
[14:00] and so I said uh I am real I'm not
[14:03] sending you a code and then so this guy
[14:06] freaks out and starts cussing me out
[14:09] over text and saying you're a scammer
[14:11] you must be a scammer because you won't
[14:12] send me the code you won't help out you
[14:14] won't and but if I would have sent him
[14:16] the code he could have logged into my
[14:19] email and not only his email but if he
[14:22] has his Google code there's many
[14:24] different ways that you can you can
[14:27] extort someone and um I I have gotten
[14:31] emails before and I got an email uh I
[14:34] don't know about five years
[14:36] ago and uh it the subject line was my
[14:42] password that I used for most
[14:45] things and I looked at it and I was like
[14:48] whoa what is what is that that's my
[14:50] password and I clicked on
[14:53] it and the email said we have have video
[14:59] of you evidence of you looking at nasty
[15:05] websites and send us it was like
[15:10] $831 and we won't share this information
[15:13] but if you don't we are going to share
[15:15] this information through social media so
[15:17] I sent it immediately forwarded it to
[15:19] our it department and I said what in the
[15:23] world is this and um they did some
[15:26] research and what had happened was
[15:29] there's a website called LinkedIn
[15:31] brother Jordan I'm sure you're familiar
[15:33] with LinkedIn probably brother Michael
[15:35] it's a it's a very popular um like a
[15:38] professional um for lack of a better
[15:41] word social media that you can just you
[15:43] can share information and job
[15:45] applications and that well what happened
[15:47] is they had a data link
[15:49] leak and my information was on that data
[15:54] leak and they use that
[15:57] information to
[15:59] um send out these threatening emails and
[16:03] try to get money and you can imagine if
[16:05] the person was guilty of doing that they
[16:08] wouldn't want their inform this all this
[16:10] stuff spread out on the web so they
[16:13] would immediately fall for this and pay
[16:15] the
[16:15] money it was a way to extort money and
[16:21] we all know and you've seen my messages
[16:23] on Whatsapp over the past couple months
[16:26] a couple at least twice this church has
[16:30] been hit with potential scams one of
[16:33] them was an email that looked like it
[16:36] came from pastor at Tucson Tabernacle
[16:39] and it went to a number of you one of
[16:42] the people that it went to was Sister
[16:45] Angela
[16:46] baggot and it was it looked like it was
[16:49] for me it said hey Angela um I need you
[16:52] to get some gift cards for me and we
[16:55] were having a an event later on so
[16:59] sister Angela immediately she's she gets
[17:03] ready and she's going to the store to
[17:05] get some of these gift cards for me and
[17:07] the instructions were were very plain I
[17:09] need four $50 gift cards or something
[17:12] like that and I need the number off of
[17:13] those and it looked just like it was me
[17:15] in fact there was a picture of me on the
[17:19] um on the email did anyone here get it
[17:22] you got it sister Debbie you got it
[17:24] there was a picture of me right on there
[17:27] and it was me ministering
[17:30] and so sister Angela
[17:33] immediately
[17:35] she gets ready and she's going to go to
[17:37] the store and get me these gift cards
[17:39] well brother
[17:40] Jeremy he text me and he's like hey
[17:43] what's basically what's the deal with
[17:45] this and I said uh I didn't do that nor
[17:47] would I ever do that and it was a scam
[17:52] and a number of people got this and then
[17:54] another one came there was another scam
[17:56] another a sister in this church
[18:00] there was a number of emails that went
[18:02] out through her did you all get that one
[18:04] from there was I think a lot of us got
[18:07] got this one but I didn't but another um
[18:12] I think it was WhatsApp no it was a
[18:14] Facebook Messenger went out from the
[18:18] sister asking for information and saying
[18:23] that there was this good deal on
[18:26] something to make money and and sent out
[18:29] to a number of the sisters in the
[18:32] church and someone called me who was it
[18:36] sister
[18:37] Amelia sister Amelia called me and she
[18:39] said brother Daniel I got this um
[18:42] email uh or I got this what this uh
[18:45] Facebook Messenger from this sister in
[18:48] the church she said and it says that we
[18:50] our social security we can get more
[18:52] money if we if we fill out this
[18:54] application I said no sister let me call
[18:57] her so I called the sister she said no
[18:59] she says a couple other people have
[19:01] asked me so what it was was it
[19:05] was another way to get your personal
[19:08] information so that they can go up and
[19:11] open up a credit card in your name or
[19:13] they can extort some money from you
[19:16] they're out there and these things are
[19:19] evil and they are getting very very good
[19:22] at what they do so when I saw this when
[19:25] brother Josiah sent me this information
[19:27] I said you know what this would be good
[19:30] for the church to hear and like I said
[19:34] you know what let's just read it brother
[19:35] brandom said that no service is complete
[19:38] without reading the word let me read a
[19:41] couple scriptures
[19:43] here um first brother Jordan if you turn
[19:47] to Matthew chapter 10: 16
[20:00] now Jesus was sending out his disciples
[20:03] to go out and spread the
[20:05] gospel and it says this behold I send
[20:08] you forth as sheep in the midst of
[20:11] wolves that's what we are today we're
[20:14] good people in a very evil World behold
[20:18] I send you forth as sheep in the midst
[20:20] of wolves be ye therefore wise as
[20:22] serpents and harmless as doves what does
[20:25] it mean to be wise as a serpent you need
[20:27] to know that serpent tactics and then
[20:31] Proverbs
[20:34] 22:3 I got this for from uh brother
[20:43] Mark Proverbs 22:3 says this a prudent
[20:48] man foresee the evil and hideth himself
[20:53] but the simple pass on and are
[20:56] punished excellent scripture

[23:47] well she says I got into my house and um
[23:51] and there's somebody following me and
[23:54] Sam says Mom did you lock the door and
[23:56] she says yeah she says but I I don't
[23:58] know what to do and he says well what
[24:00] kind of what kind of car is he driving
[24:02] and she says I don't

[24:08] he look like she says I don't
[24:11] know and he says mom well who's
[24:13] following you she says I don't know I

[24:21] mom if you don't if you can't if you
[24:23] haven't seen
[24:24] him and you don't know what kind of car
[24:27] he's driving
[24:29] driving he says how do you know
[24:31] somebody's following you she says I got
[24:32] a I got a text on my phone said that
[24:35] this person is following me now it's
[24:40] Facebook just following her on
[24:43] Facebook same
[24:45] person this one is not so
[24:49] funny sister Helen got a uh phone
[24:53] call from her son um her other son
[24:57] Stephen
[25:00] and he says mom I need some money and it
[25:04] wasn't like Stephen she says she says
[25:06] okay what uh what's wrong he says Mom I
[25:08] just I just need some
[25:10] money and he says okay and um it was a
[25:15] phone number that she didn't
[25:17] recognize and he says mom if you could
[25:20] just if you could just Apple pay me the
[25:22] money and I think it was to that phone
[25:24] number I don't remember exactly the
[25:26] details and she said says o okay okay
[25:29] well
[25:31] um what do you need it for and and he
[25:33] says Mom I just I just need the
[25:36] money and she ended up calling Sam her
[25:41] other
[25:42] son and she said Sam she said Stephen
[25:45] just call me and he he needs
[25:47] money and he's like Mom that doesn't
[25:50] sound like
[25:51] Stephen so he says call Stephen back she
[25:55] called him back on his phone and he says
[25:57] no Mom that wasn't me do you know those
[26:01] voice
[26:01] recognition
[26:04] software it sounded ex exactly like her
[26:08] son
[26:09] Stephen and it was someone trying to get
[26:13] money out of her and I think that leads
[26:16] in
[26:18] perfectly do I need this or uh the
[26:22] other's fine okay yeah and that the
[26:24] technology is so good that they need
[26:27] three seconds of your voice
[26:28] if they've got three seconds of your
[26:30] voice they can do a realistic fake of
[26:32] your voice that's how good it's getting
[26:35] so well God bless you for coming the
[26:38] last time I gave this was in Santiago
[26:40] Chile in a week or a year ago in
[26:44] February and uh those young people were
[26:47] so pumped to be there it was their first
[26:50] Camp after the shutdown there's over 500
[26:53] young people from every uh country
[26:56] except Brazil in South America so so
[26:58] they didn't want to give anything up so
[27:00] they had this really packed agenda and
[27:02] if an event ran over they would just
[27:05] start the next event later so by the
[27:08] time I got to my presentation it was
[27:09] after midnight and they had done soccer
[27:12] they' done skits they' done games they
[27:14] had done all this stuff all day and I
[27:17] just felt bad these poor young people
[27:19] and nobody moved and nobody blinked and
[27:21] nobody fell asleep they're right with me
[27:23] the whole time so I was pretty impressed
[27:25] so if you ever get a chance to meet
[27:26] those young people in Chile you know in
[27:28] South America they're great you'd really
[27:31] love them and we've got some older young
[27:33] people here tonight too so there's two
[27:35] kinds of young people you know there's
[27:37] young young people there's older young
[27:40] people so we've got both here
[27:43] tonight but thanks for coming especially
[27:46] on a Monday and this topic we're in is
[27:48] sometimes scary to people it's a topic
[27:51] that makes people nervous because they
[27:52] use all these products that are out
[27:54] there and they're afraid somebody's
[27:55] going to tell them they got to quit
[27:57] doing what they're doing but what I've
[27:59] got here is information based and I've
[28:02] learned over almost 10 years of working
[28:05] with this topic if you just get the
[28:07] information to the people so they
[28:09] understand what's going on the Holy
[28:12] Ghost can teach them how to deal with it
[28:14] so I'm not here to do the Holy Ghost job
[28:16] and tell you how to deal with your
[28:18] device and your internet and your usage
[28:20] and all of that I'm here to get you the
[28:22] information as best as I can and the
[28:24] Holy Ghost will help you because it is a
[28:26] treacherous age we live in many dangers
[28:30] very very tricky and getting
[28:35] trickier that is a beautiful
[28:38] guitar I had one kind of like that in
[28:41] college and I sold
[28:43] it and I didn't know what I sold and it
[28:46] took me years and years to find another
[28:49] ianz hollow body like the one I had in
[28:51] college and it's not exactly like but it
[28:53] was pretty close isn't that pretty has
[28:57] anyone ever seen a guitar like that
[28:59] before an ianz semih hollow body with
[29:03] the kind of tiger stripes on the wood
[29:05] and all that they're pretty rare they're
[29:07] kind of hard to find but I finally found
[29:09] one and so that's a picture of it in our
[29:14] house um I usually maybe you don't but
[29:18] when I'm using my laptop I usually keep
[29:21] a little piece of tape over the camera
[29:24] and a little piece of tape over the
[29:26] microphone I don't know why I just do
[29:28] that you know it's just a habit I have
[29:30] but I took it off one night and U cuz I
[29:33] had to do a zoom U call with someone and
[29:36] I had the tape off the
[29:39] camera
[29:41] and I had the zoom call sat down on the
[29:43] couch played the guitar a little bit
[29:46] went to
[29:47] bed got up the next morning opened my
[29:50] computer and what do I see this ad so I
[29:53] took a screenshot of
[29:55] it does that guitar look familiar to
[30:04] anyone close or exactly okay side by
[30:08] side so I went to Google images and I
[30:11] typed in ibenz semi Hol body guitar and
[30:16] I looked at every image all the way to
[30:18] the end that's all where it says you
[30:20] know no more images and there was no
[30:23] picture exactly like my guitar on the
[30:26] internet
[30:29] is that a
[30:31] coincidence or what I had my my tape off
[30:34] my camera for a couple of hours that was
[30:39] it
[30:42] coincidence you're all looking like I
[30:44] don't know I'm not not so sure could be
[30:47] a coincidence well then I started to
[30:49] think
[30:51] okay maybe it's not exactly like my
[30:56] guitar maybe it is a picture of my
[31:00] guitar but through software they
[31:02] transposed into an image and made an ad
[31:05] that would catch my eye the very next
[31:08] day wouldn't that be interesting if that
[31:11] actually were my
[31:16] guitar um there's another thing that
[31:19] could be happening here it could be that
[31:22] because I leave a profile on the
[31:25] internet that they figured out my
[31:27] personality
[31:29] and they figured out my income and they
[31:32] figured out what kind of guitar I would
[31:34] be likely to have and so they took a
[31:36] really good guess and that's what they
[31:39] came up with that's possible too
[31:43] right so which do you think it is did
[31:46] they profile
[31:47] me or did they get a picture of my
[31:50] guitar number one who thinks number one
[31:52] who thinks they profiled me no okay
[31:56] we've got a couple who thinks they got a
[31:58] picture of my guitar through my okay I
[32:02] don't know but here's the next question
[32:04] which of those things would be more
[32:08] troubling which of those two things
[32:10] would be more troubling that they could
[32:12] profile you that
[32:16] well Prett or that they could actually
[32:19] get into your living room and get a
[32:22] picture through your camera it's hard to
[32:24] say which is worse right they're both
[32:27] pretty bad
[32:29] anyone know this fell
[32:32] here all together now Mark
[32:37] Zuckerberg
[32:41] okay you notice anything interesting on
[32:43] this picture let's zoom in a little
[32:45] closer there he is and you see his beady
[32:48] little eyes
[32:50] there but if you look over to the left
[32:52] there's his personal
[32:55] laptop what do you see there
[33:00] tape over the
[33:02] camera and tape over the
[33:06] microphone why would he do
[33:10] that any idea anyone why would he do
[33:14] that you know I I started researching
[33:17] this uh subject in digital years
[33:20] centuries ago that would be like
[33:23] 2016 so in digital years that's long
[33:26] long long time ago only eight years but
[33:29] I started to read the interviews with
[33:32] developers like Zuckerberg and find
[33:34] places where they would ask them
[33:37] questions like is it possible for you to
[33:40] look through the camera of someone's
[33:44] smartphone if they give permission to
[33:47] the app to use the camera is it possible
[33:51] to hear through the microphone this is
[33:53] back in the olden days we're just
[33:54] figuring this out and they say well
[33:59] technology Wise It's possible to do
[34:03] that but we assure you we would never do
[34:07] a thing like that that's the kind of
[34:09] answers they give we would never it'd be
[34:12] illegal it would be immoral you can just
[34:14] take our word for it we would never look
[34:17] through your
[34:18] camera and we would never listen to your
[34:22] through your microphone okay next
[34:25] question if you did do do
[34:28] that would there be any way anyone else
[34:32] could find
[34:35] out well
[34:37] no not
[34:39] really you could never get caught you
[34:42] could never get caught no not not
[34:45] really okay so they have the
[34:49] ability how about motive do they have
[34:52] the
[34:53] motive they are in the information
[34:56] gathering business
[34:58] that's what they do so that they can
[35:01] sell
[35:02] advertising so they've got the
[35:05] ability and they've got the
[35:07] motive and they can't get
[35:12] caught are we that
[35:16] naive are we that naive they can't get
[35:19] caught they have the ability and they
[35:21] have the motive and their profit depends
[35:23] on it and what we have from them is
[35:27] their word
[35:29] that's what we have to go on we have
[35:31] their word we will never look through
[35:33] your camera we'll never listen through
[35:34] your microphone has anyone ever given an
[35:37] app permission this app needs your
[35:40] camera access to your camera to
[35:44] work just a little something to think
[35:47] about where do you take that phone do
[35:49] you take it into the bathroom into the
[35:52] bedroom all through your
[35:55] house see you don't know what's on the
[35:58] other side of that we just see the I I
[36:01] have one here oh I left it I have a
[36:03] smartphone okay I carry it
[36:07] around but you're carrying around a spy
[36:09] device just remember that there's people
[36:12] behind there you only see the screen but
[36:16] they're just beyond that there's people
[36:19] that are running those things and
[36:20] pulling the
[36:22] strings so back 10 years ago when I
[36:26] started researching ing this topic by
[36:28] the way do we have a bottle of water
[36:30] somewhere
[36:32] okay I'm from the Northwest water falls
[36:34] from the sky there so
[36:38] you um this brand new thing this wave of
[36:41] technology that came down and people
[36:44] were jumping in and getting involved and
[36:47] I was feeling a little easy some uneasy
[36:50] about it something's off about this
[36:52] something just doesn't seem right and
[36:56] couldn't quite put my finger on what was
[36:57] thank you
[36:59] [Music]
[37:01] brother and I would hear the preachers
[37:04] would throw out comments to warn people
[37:07] that some of these apps and some of
[37:09] these things that are coming out might
[37:10] not be good for you and it was very
[37:12] vague and very general and I couldn't
[37:15] really see put my finger on what the
[37:17] problem
[37:18] was after all look at what all these
[37:21] wonderful things they promised they can
[37:23] do for you but it was a burden for me so
[37:26] I started to re rearch resarch and I
[37:28] realized why it was so General because
[37:31] it's such a huge subject and ministers
[37:34] have a lot to do they've got to teach
[37:36] the word they got to manage a church and
[37:37] it really takes a lot of concentration
[37:40] and a specialty to get your mind around
[37:42] what's going on out there and then the
[37:44] Lord started to deal with me well why
[37:46] don't you do it so I started researching
[37:49] we just finished a book I have a partner
[37:52] that works with me it's by that same
[37:54] title choose digital Holiness so I've
[37:57] actually got for you tonight is a whole
[37:59] book and about 12 sessions crammed into
[38:01] one evening so if there's a lot of
[38:03] information that's why but any of this
[38:05] that we're going through tonight if you
[38:06] want to find out more about it we'll
[38:08] just stop when we run out of time but
[38:10] we've got more information to back up
[38:13] the things that we throw out here
[38:14] tonight the book was actually designed
[38:16] as a workbook that a church or youth
[38:19] group could go through together with a
[38:22] chapter on a subject and then some
[38:23] discussion questions and you can work
[38:25] through all the issues as a group
[38:28] hasn't been reviewed yet by a church but
[38:30] I would like some church to try it and
[38:32] give us some feedback because we want
[38:34] what we're putting out there to really
[38:35] be helpful to
[38:37] people so churches Christians in general
[38:41] jumped into the wave and started getting
[38:44] all these products and these phones and
[38:46] these apps on their phones and message
[38:48] Believers in general jumped into the
[38:50] pool to this is something brand new with
[38:53] the rest of the world and everyone was
[38:56] doing it because
[38:58] everyone was doing it nothing succeeds
[39:01] like success that's part of the
[39:04] marketing strategy is to get everyone
[39:06] doing it and they asked uh Mark
[39:09] Zuckerberg what are you going to do to
[39:11] the the people who don't sign up for
[39:13] your Facebook which he was starting at
[39:15] that time and he said simple you just
[39:18] get their
[39:19] friends and once you get their friends
[39:21] you get them because everybody wants to
[39:23] be with their friends did it work of
[39:25] course it did
[39:28] well last year in 2023 so now we're 10
[39:31] 13 years later the Surgeon General
[39:33] issues an advisory that social media is
[39:36] harmful to mental health just like they
[39:39] used to put warnings on the packs of you
[39:41] know boxes of cigarettes I hope they
[39:43] still do harmful to your mental health
[39:46] isn't that wonderful after 10
[39:50] years after a sharp rise in everything
[39:54] bad I've got lots of graphs I could show
[39:56] you suicide depression everything bad
[39:59] that coincides exactly with this digital
[40:02] wave that came out so after 10 years of
[40:04] that they come out with you know we
[40:08] think these things might be harmful by
[40:10] the time the world notices a problem
[40:13] it's way way way way the horse has left
[40:17] the barn a long time ago the trains left
[40:19] the station we're way down the
[40:21] road and now they're using phrases like
[40:24] I'll quote one of them we are in the
[40:26] middle of a National Youth Mental Health
[40:29] crisis that's a quote from the Surgeon
[40:32] General and we think that social media
[40:35] might have a part of
[40:38] it oh my could the church and because we
[40:42] got into this too and are showing a lot
[40:44] of the same problems could the church
[40:46] have avoided
[40:48] it well the world isn't going to be
[40:50] warned but the church should be warned
[40:53] and threat should be identified by the
[40:55] Holy Ghost if we are listening
[40:58] even now the government is putting most
[41:00] of their focus on harms to young people
[41:04] well I'm going to give a little news
[41:06] flash 10 years from now they might
[41:08] figure out that it's not just young
[41:10] people that are being harmed right it's
[41:12] human beings of all ages that's why
[41:15] everyone who knows someone who has a
[41:17] smartphone was invited tonight it's I'm
[41:20] not a prophet but it's much more than a
[41:22] youth crisis even though we have lots of
[41:24] young people here it's scrambling God's
[41:27] provided way and that has negative
[41:30] repercussions that go through every
[41:32] strata of people adults of all ages are
[41:36] damaged families marriages the fabric of
[41:39] society are threatened democracies you
[41:42] can read about some of that in the book
[41:44] if you want to go that deep it's even
[41:45] threatening democracies and the Surgeon
[41:48] General might figure that out eventually
[41:50] also but they're behind the curve so I'm
[41:53] inviting Believers to prayerfully look
[41:55] at some of what we've reach searched and
[41:58] be ahead of the problem and get ahead of
[42:01] the problem
[42:03] why because there are new things coming
[42:06] down now that are about to explode on an
[42:11] unprepared
[42:12] world so with the first wave we're in
[42:15] damage control for the next wave we have
[42:17] a chance to be ahead of the problem
[42:20] before it hits and what's coming down
[42:23] now is many more times dangerous than
[42:25] social media ever was and more
[42:29] addictive I'm going to show some
[42:31] highlights we started a website also I
[42:34] had it on the first screen digital
[42:35] holiness. org so we're have that as a
[42:38] repository of information as we find out
[42:41] new things we can post it on there and
[42:43] hopefully help people be informed
[42:45] information and tools still under
[42:48] construction but we're lowbudget and
[42:50] we're just a couple of brothers so we're
[42:51] doing the best we
[42:53] can so if I say something here that
[42:55] tweaks you you can go to that and and
[42:58] read more about it so when I began
[43:01] speaking on this in the beginning I
[43:03] sensed a little reluctance among
[43:05] Believers even to talk about it and that
[43:07] was puzzling this is something big that
[43:10] our people are getting involved in
[43:12] shouldn't we be probing it and talking
[43:15] about it and I understand a little more
[43:17] why now there's actually spiritual
[43:19] forces there's demonic forces involved
[43:23] and in some of the longer presentations
[43:26] we can show you in quotes where some of
[43:28] this has been identified already in the
[43:31] message if you study the message and the
[43:34] scriptures together you can put a puzzle
[43:36] together that we should have known that
[43:37] some of these things were coming so you
[43:40] young people thank you for coming I know
[43:42] that you're often the Target and you get
[43:44] preached at but you're going to find out
[43:46] very quickly that um I believe young
[43:49] people should be spoken to respectfully
[43:52] you're very smart you go to school you
[43:54] do amazing things and you don't need to
[43:57] be talked down to so I'm going to speak
[43:59] to you respectfully and gently that's
[44:01] how brother random talked to young
[44:02] people go find some of the on the tapes
[44:04] where he had young people's meetings and
[44:07] see how respectfully and gently he spoke
[44:10] to young people and so I believe in
[44:12] emotions but this isn't going to be that
[44:15] kind of meaning and you don't have to be
[44:16] whipped up into a
[44:18] frenzy you can be spoken to in a by the
[44:21] Lord in a calm orderly meeting and you
[44:24] don't have to put be put under a guilt
[44:26] trip and con ition either I believe you
[44:29] just need to be shown the facts so
[44:31] that's what we're going to do
[44:34] tonight you deserve to know what's going
[44:36] on you don't need to be manipulated now
[44:39] that's what these platforms are trying
[44:40] to do is manipulate
[44:44] you but they attract you first what kind
[44:47] of Life do you want to
[44:49] have the choices you make determine the
[44:52] kind of life you're going to
[44:55] have or depend depending on the Holy
[44:57] Spirit to help you make those
[45:01] choices so this digital wave that came
[45:04] on the world the world was unprepared
[45:06] for we were not expecting it the church
[45:09] was not prepared for it and that little
[45:12] subsection of the church called the
[45:14] message was not prepared for it
[45:17] either what am I talking about it's
[45:20] pretty much anything that comes on a
[45:22] screen so that could be a video game it
[45:25] could be Skype it could be a phone it
[45:27] could be an app it could be a program
[45:29] and eventually it'll get Beyond screens
[45:30] onto Holograms but right now it's on
[45:33] screens and they come making many
[45:36] promises to us they're going to give us
[45:40] things they
[45:43] say things that are so attractive that
[45:45] we would almost jump at without thinking
[45:48] like a fish would take
[45:51] bait Mark Zuckerberg says we're just
[45:54] connecting people with people what's
[45:57] wrong with
[45:59] that what we didn't notice was so many
[46:02] of these things it's giving us one
[46:05] thing but it's taking away something
[46:07] more
[46:08] valuable see and you're gaining the
[46:11] thing and you have all your attention on
[46:13] that but it's taking away something more
[46:16] valuable um it would help I think to
[46:19] learn from our past mistakes so there's
[46:22] two common mistakes I think that have
[46:24] been made by believers well-meaning
[46:26] brothers and sisters ministers everybody
[46:29] but I've boiled it down to two there's
[46:31] probably more but there's two that
[46:37] recur this is a balance sheet I'm sure
[46:40] some of you have seen it it has all of
[46:43] your assets and income on one side and
[46:47] on the other your expenses your bills
[46:49] your
[46:50] liabilities so when this digital age
[46:52] burst upon us it showed us the asset
[46:55] side this is what you're going to gain
[46:58] these are all the things you're going to
[47:00] be able to
[47:01] do it didn't show us the cost side maybe
[47:05] didn't even know what the cost side was
[47:07] and any business any budget any family
[47:10] any government if you're working from
[47:13] one side of a balance sheet can you make
[47:15] good
[47:17] decisions no you need both
[47:21] sides let's think about the tactics of
[47:24] the serpent
[47:28] he offered something to the
[47:31] woman you're going to gain this this
[47:34] wisdom you're going to gain you're going
[47:36] to gain gain gain and then he gave her a
[47:38] dose of fomo who knows what fomo
[47:42] is fear of missing
[47:45] out if you don't listen to me you're
[47:48] going to be missing
[47:50] out he didn't show her the cost
[47:54] side in all those years have his his
[47:57] tactics
[47:58] changed no so he would be still doing
[48:01] the same thing he will offer something
[48:04] you you perceive is valuable when you
[48:06] take it he takes away something much
[48:09] more valuable so technology that is in
[48:12] the world
[48:13] today what is the source and the origin
[48:16] of Technology message Believers that
[48:18] listen to the tapes
[48:21] occasionally
[48:23] technology comes from the Devil
[48:27] the Lord will use
[48:29] it sometimes but he's not the author of
[48:33] it it's not going to be there on the
[48:35] other side
[48:38] see so technology is offering something
[48:42] and when it is we better stop a moment
[48:45] back up and say wait a minute what's the
[48:48] catch what is it taking away don't just
[48:51] jump right in so that was the first
[48:53] mistake I think we jumped in too quickly
[48:55] without thinking
[48:57] and we took the
[48:58] bait I put myself in that it looked
[49:01] really good but the cost started to show
[49:04] up after a while and whenever I speak on
[49:06] this topic usually there's someone who
[49:09] will come up to me afterward and give me
[49:12] a list of all the benefits so if you're
[49:15] that person I look forward to seeing you
[49:17] after but let I know the benefits I
[49:19] understand I'm just saying that we need
[49:21] to look at the other side of this too
[49:23] get the whole picture together so so the
[49:27] second mistake if that made sense I just
[49:30] made this little graph here this is what
[49:32] I call the resistance and Temptation
[49:35] scale so whichever is stronger that's
[49:37] the way you go so if your temptation is
[49:40] stronger than your resistance your
[49:42] Temptation wins out if your resistance
[49:45] is stronger than your Temptation then
[49:47] your resistance wins
[49:49] out so all these things come and the
[49:52] young people start using them and the
[49:55] ministers and the pastors don't
[49:57] understand them and it takes a lot of
[49:59] work and they can't possibly articulate
[50:01] all the dangers even though they kind of
[50:03] sense it's there so they take this
[50:06] shortcut by putting emphasis all the
[50:09] emphasis on the resistance side of the
[50:12] scale to the neglect sometimes of
[50:15] dealing with the Temptation
[50:17] side but by the holy ghost in the
[50:20] scriptures you can actually reduce the
[50:23] weight of the Temptations you can work
[50:26] on both sides of this so the advice
[50:28] usually comes in this abbreviated form
[50:31] we just need to get the Holy
[50:34] Ghost if we get the Holy Ghost we will
[50:38] be able to overcome all the Temptations
[50:41] and we said amen and I say
[50:43] Amen
[50:46] but Turn the Page how does the Holy
[50:50] Ghost do that you have to drill down a
[50:54] little bit if we examine
[50:57] how the Holy Ghost helps you to overcome
[51:01] Temptations there's a lot more to the
[51:03] story than that he strengthens your
[51:06] ability to resist
[51:09] temptation and he teaches you how to
[51:14] avoid Temptation I'll show you a few
[51:17] examples this is in the scriptures I
[51:19] don't have the time here to do 10
[51:21] scriptures so we'll do
[51:24] three if we don't uh is that all on
[51:28] there oh it's not all on there okay the
[51:30] Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly
[51:32] out of Temptation 2 Peter
[51:36] 2:9 you'll see a pattern here as you go
[51:39] through the scriptures there's so many
[51:41] of them that are like this and lead us
[51:43] not into temptation but Deliver Us from
[51:46] Evil that's in the Lord's
[51:51] Prayer watch and pray that you enter not
[51:54] into temptation if you haven't been
[51:56] watching for this sometimes we translate
[51:58] in our mind lead us not into sin we we
[52:02] substitute
[52:04] sin but it always says not always but so
[52:07] much of the time the emphasis is
[52:10] defeated at the Temptation
[52:13] level before it gets to the sin
[52:17] level I'll give you one more example get
[52:19] the Holy Ghost is always the right
[52:21] advice but it doesn't go far enough sin
[52:24] is overcome at the Temptation therefore
[52:26] if you have have the Holy Ghost he will
[52:28] be teaching you how to minimize the
[52:31] Temptations you face how many believe
[52:34] that Timothy remember Timothy in the
[52:37] Bible had the Holy Ghost God's Great you
[52:42] know one of his great Apostles and one
[52:44] of Paul's uh favorite men that he leaned
[52:48] upon so Paul writes these letters to
[52:50] Timothy and he gives him some advice
[52:53] that might not all be on the screen do
[52:55] you have your Bibles second Timothy 222
[52:58] that's all twos 2 Timothy
[53:01] 2
[53:03] 22 pull it
[53:05] up pull it right up second Timothy
[53:11] 2:22 and I kind of divide it into three
[53:14] different um phrases here so we can
[53:17] break it down because there's three
[53:18] things in this verse flee also youthful
[53:21] lust so this older Minister talking to
[53:24] the younger Minister both Having the
[53:25] Holy Ghost
[53:28] but adversative conjunction instead of
[53:31] that do this but follow righteousness
[53:35] Faith charity and
[53:36] peace and
[53:40] with them that call on the Lord out of a
[53:43] pure heart now that's
[53:47] loaded Timothy resist okay you do need
[53:51] to resist but the word that Paul chooses
[53:53] is even
[53:55] stronger
[53:57] flee get out of
[54:00] exposure to youthful lusts that's the
[54:04] Temptation you're fleeing the
[54:10] temptation but follow and that's not
[54:13] like following someone on social media
[54:16] follow righteousness Faith charity and
[54:22] peace with everyone else on your
[54:25] platform
[54:27] no see he's got the church in there with
[54:31] them that call on the name of the Lord
[54:33] out of a pure heart so he's got a social
[54:35] group for you these kinds of people are
[54:38] your social
[54:39] group this is what you're running away
[54:42] from and this is what you're running
[54:44] away to in one little verse there he
[54:47] wipes out a lot of the things that we
[54:50] could stumble over it's one little verse
[54:52] contains all of that the Holy Ghost is
[54:56] teaching avoidance of Temptation work on
[54:59] the avoidance side of the scale to get
[55:02] Temptation down to a level where you can
[55:05] resist so we're going to get practical
[55:08] in a moment we're doing a little bit of
[55:10] theory to start with but I want to get
[55:12] to write down to how exactly do we do
[55:16] that so I'll have a slide in a minute
[55:18] that we can look at we're doing
[55:22] good and all of this is in the workbook
[55:25] too so keep that in your mind I'm going
[55:28] to hit one more thing and then we'll
[55:29] Circle back around but brother Mark I'm
[55:32] not really tempted by Youthful
[55:35] lusts well you're tempted by something I
[55:37] guarantee
[55:39] you there's Temptations for older people
[55:41] too brother Mark I'm just keeping in
[55:46] touch with my friends and family on
[55:48] these platforms maybe you are but I have
[55:51] six words for you to ponder it wasn't so
[55:54] from the beginning
[55:56] six words that's right let's look at
[56:00] this little chart here there's quite a
[56:02] bit here to look at God's provided way
[56:04] for our time and attention God actually
[56:07] has a way for it when he designed us he
[56:10] also thoughtfully designed the society
[56:14] that we would live in that would meet
[56:17] our needs
[56:20] organically it's like a glove made for a
[56:23] hand and a hand made for a glove so God
[56:26] made both he made both the society you
[56:28] would live in and he and he structured
[56:30] you and it's in a balance so all those
[56:33] things work in a balance so if you start
[56:35] changing and messing around with the
[56:38] society structure or the individual
[56:40] either way you mess up God's Perfect
[56:44] Balance so I took this from the
[56:46] Israelite
[56:47] calendar because the Lord was setting up
[56:50] an entire
[56:51] nation and all of their needs so their
[56:54] physical emotional social all their
[56:57] needs would be met in the way that God
[57:00] set it up so you've got right in the
[57:02] middle the intimate family group so that
[57:04] was the where it starts with and they
[57:07] have constant daily
[57:10] attention in the Israelite worship they
[57:13] would have what we would call church or
[57:15] synagogue weekly so that puts you into a
[57:18] larger circle of people other families
[57:22] okay very simple and then as a nation
[57:25] all the way on the outside you see uh
[57:28] annual events so the Israelite family
[57:32] three times a year travels to
[57:35] Jerusalem and I'm sure with all the
[57:38] other Israelite families that travel
[57:40] also it's like going to camp and they
[57:42] see these other people once or twice or
[57:45] three times a year so they have a much
[57:47] larger circle of people there that
[57:49] they're connected with so they've got
[57:52] the
[57:52] daily the yearly and the weekly so all
[57:55] of your social needs are met through
[57:58] that what social media does through
[58:03] technology this is how it's going to
[58:05] scramble God's provided way it takes
[58:08] every distant relationship that's way
[58:11] out
[58:12] there and puts it right down into your
[58:15] immediate daily Circle that's
[58:18] good that's what it does and God never
[58:22] designed it that way that's right he
[58:24] didn't design you that way you don't
[58:26] operate that way that's a good thing
[58:29] they say well it's a good thing for the
[58:31] developers because then you have to be
[58:33] on there all the time to maintain those
[58:37] relationships that God never ordained
[58:39] for you to have anyway at least not in
[58:42] that kind of frequency our time and
[58:48] attention they're the only things God
[58:50] gave
[58:52] us that's all we have is our time and
[58:56] our
[58:57] tension it cannot expand endlessly to
[59:02] embrace an infinite number of
[59:06] people if we are giving time and
[59:09] attention to maintaining on a daily
[59:11] basis distant relationships and this
[59:14] becomes a religion too because it has a
[59:17] reward and a
[59:21] guilt if you don't maintain those if you
[59:24] didn't reply
[59:26] oh then you've got this social pressure
[59:28] this social guilt that didn't come from
[59:30] the Lord it came from the platform now
[59:32] they've got a guilt trip on you you've
[59:34] got to reply to it's false
[59:38] guilt it causes you if you're deceived
[59:41] by this to defraud your primary
[59:47] relationships wow because you have t
[59:49] less time and attention for him you're
[59:51] trying to maintain this whole huge it
[59:54] was not so from the beginning
[59:58] W Paul said it do not defraud one
[1:00:01] another that's a scripture well there's
[1:00:03] a lots of ways you could defraud it's
[1:00:05] not just Financial there's lots of ways
[1:00:08] you can defraud people of your time and
[1:00:10] attention Jesus said it in Mark 10:19
[1:00:14] it's all through the law of Moses
[1:00:15] defraud not your brother what do we owe
[1:00:18] each other we don't owe every person the
[1:00:21] same way you don't owe Those Distant
[1:00:24] relationships the same attention that
[1:00:26] you owe that the God put right in your
[1:00:29] house your husband your wife your family
[1:00:33] all those
[1:00:34] people there has to be a
[1:00:38] focus you actually don't have the
[1:00:40] emotional resources to do it you'll wear
[1:00:43] yourself out that's why we start getting
[1:00:45] all these repercussions of of depression
[1:00:48] and and this worn out feeling it weakens
[1:00:51] families it weakens primary
[1:00:53] relationships husband and wife
[1:00:55] relationship ships parent child
[1:00:58] relationships the Surgeon General hasn't
[1:01:00] figured this part out yet I think they
[1:01:03] will I hope they do but by the word of
[1:01:06] God we can see the Lord didn't set it up
[1:01:08] that
[1:01:09] way because of social media many times
[1:01:14] every
[1:01:15] day people pull away from interaction
[1:01:18] with a live
[1:01:21] person to maintain a relationship with
[1:01:24] some digital image of a person which
[1:01:27] isn't the real them anyway it's a
[1:01:29] carefully curated version of
[1:01:34] them so all relationships don't have the
[1:01:37] same priority I'll just tell you a story
[1:01:40] I was I came to a hotel one time and I
[1:01:43] was trying to check in and there was one
[1:01:45] person at the desk and there was kind of
[1:01:47] a line forming behind me because the
[1:01:50] phone kept
[1:01:51] ringing and every time the phone rang
[1:01:54] the clerk would leave dealing with me
[1:01:57] and deal with the person on the phone
[1:02:00] and it happened like three or four times
[1:02:01] in a row and eventually I'm saying hey
[1:02:04] I'm
[1:02:05] here they're out there deal with me you
[1:02:09] know that's kind of what it's like God
[1:02:11] wants us to have real face-to-face
[1:02:14] relationships with the people that are
[1:02:16] in our
[1:02:17] Circle so it
[1:02:19] scrambles God's Perfect
[1:02:22] Design it was not so from the beginning
[1:02:26] brother
[1:02:29] Mark I have to use it for
[1:02:31] school I have to use it for
[1:02:34] work in eight years I've encountered a
[1:02:37] few of these questions and they're
[1:02:39] they're legitimate they're
[1:02:42] legitimate up in the Northwest we have
[1:02:44] spiders and they uh they make these webs
[1:02:47] do you have those here yeah okay I'm I'm
[1:02:51] not from around here all right so the
[1:02:54] question why does a spider not not get
[1:02:56] caught in his own
[1:02:58] web because not all of the web is sticky
[1:03:00] and he knows where to
[1:03:03] step so those longitudinal framing
[1:03:06] strands that go through if he puts his
[1:03:08] feet on those he doesn't get stuck the
[1:03:11] other bugs don't know that so he can
[1:03:13] crawl all over that web but the ones
[1:03:16] that go horizontally in between those
[1:03:19] are
[1:03:20] sticky so just by way of example and I
[1:03:24] put this up as an example Le but it's
[1:03:27] always evolving so don't engrave that
[1:03:29] down as what's safe and what
[1:03:33] isn't uh but the business model of many
[1:03:36] platforms it is their business model to
[1:03:39] be
[1:03:40] sticky they have to be sticky that's how
[1:03:43] they profit there's others that aren't
[1:03:46] and so their business is to grab and
[1:03:48] hold as much of your attention as they
[1:03:52] can how do they do it by demanding your
[1:03:55] attention
[1:03:56] no through
[1:03:58] attraction they do it through attraction
[1:04:01] so using
[1:04:03] supercomputers they crack the code on
[1:04:05] your
[1:04:08] brain and learn what attracts
[1:04:11] you and what holds you you aren't just
[1:04:15] looking at that little device behind
[1:04:16] there is supercomputers that are more
[1:04:20] powerful than the military
[1:04:22] has and their one job is to crack the
[1:04:25] code on
[1:04:28] you you just see the little device
[1:04:31] there's a huge machine behind that
[1:04:35] thing creates a new type of
[1:04:39] addiction back in the old days it was
[1:04:41] like alcohol
[1:04:43] addiction and if someone had an alcohol
[1:04:45] addiction and they were a little bit
[1:04:47] embarrassed about it they would go into
[1:04:50] the bathroom shut the door take the
[1:04:53] drink there
[1:04:58] nowadays people might go into the
[1:04:59] bathroom close the door and get on their
[1:05:04] smartphone or the
[1:05:06] closet because they know something's a
[1:05:08] little bit wrong
[1:05:10] there it's a sign of an
[1:05:13] addiction what do these platforms want
[1:05:16] from you let's talk about that for a
[1:05:18] minute what do they want from
[1:05:20] you they want to have the most intimate
[1:05:24] place the most intimate place in your
[1:05:27] life that's what they want the most
[1:05:30] intimate place they want to be your
[1:05:33] closest buddy they want to be where you
[1:05:36] go for
[1:05:38] Comfort they want to be the first thing
[1:05:41] you look at in the
[1:05:43] morning and the last thing at
[1:05:47] night do they have the
[1:05:51] right to that
[1:05:54] place
[1:05:58] Christians that ought to be a little bit
[1:06:00] of a problem for a Christian sure
[1:06:02] because the most intimate place in a
[1:06:05] Christian's life is already
[1:06:07] taken by the
[1:06:10] Lord the place is not open the Lord has
[1:06:13] that
[1:06:15] place the next place is your husband and
[1:06:18] wife husband or wife the next place
[1:06:21] would be your family the next place
[1:06:23] would be your church the Believers where
[1:06:26] you
[1:06:28] Fellowship okay so how far down that
[1:06:30] list is the platform supposed to
[1:06:33] be quite a ways down yeah amen and what
[1:06:38] they want to do is
[1:06:40] budge do you ever budge in line in
[1:06:42] school they want to budge all the way to
[1:06:45] the front of the line and be the most
[1:06:48] important thing the most intimate thing
[1:06:51] in your
[1:06:53] life let's put it this way these
[1:06:57] platforms want the place in your heart
[1:07:00] that God has a
[1:07:03] good that's what they want they want the
[1:07:05] place that God has
[1:07:08] amen well we could go a little farther
[1:07:11] they want to be your God
[1:07:15] Amen some things on the internet are
[1:07:17] much more neutral we know that
[1:07:20] navigation tools such as the ones that
[1:07:23] got me here from the hotel today
[1:07:26] I turn that thing on and it's not trying
[1:07:28] to get me back when I turn it off it's
[1:07:31] not sticky it's just
[1:07:35] useful some things are like that
[1:07:37] navigation tools maybe email maybe some
[1:07:40] Commerce certain things online classes
[1:07:44] their business model isn't dependent on
[1:07:47] being my God or my
[1:07:50] buddy they're providing a service so
[1:07:52] this is the tree of the knowledge of
[1:07:55] good
[1:07:56] and evil so both things are in there
[1:07:59] that's why it's tricky that's why I made
[1:08:01] this little uh graphic silly as it
[1:08:04] is there's good in there useful things
[1:08:08] and evil things that can trap you and
[1:08:11] Rob you so we have to be paying
[1:08:14] attention to the
[1:08:17] difference anything can be addictive but
[1:08:19] some things are
[1:08:21] designed to be addictive and the
[1:08:24] shareholders that have invested in it
[1:08:26] demand that be addicted because they
[1:08:28] need
[1:08:31] users does their business model require
[1:08:35] your engagement for them to profit yes
[1:08:38] or no if yes be very careful it's sticky
[1:08:42] it's a sticky part of the
[1:08:46] web okay I told you we get into some
[1:08:50] practicals this is what we call the
[1:08:52] digital intervention scale and it kind
[1:08:54] of moves from left to
[1:08:57] right so what level of intervention you
[1:09:00] do you need so I'm not going to tell you
[1:09:02] that but this is something that you need
[1:09:03] to decide when we did the camp in Chile
[1:09:08] over 500 young people and we did an
[1:09:10] anonymous survey with them and the vast
[1:09:12] majority were not satisfied with how
[1:09:15] they were handling their device as a
[1:09:17] Christian and they were good young
[1:09:19] people but in an anonymous survey they
[1:09:21] would admit that they're not satisfied
[1:09:23] would you like to be satisfied so we
[1:09:25] developed this as a road map to get you
[1:09:29] there and older people
[1:09:32] too it's not a matter of just trying
[1:09:35] harder how about a strategy so we've got
[1:09:38] these are different things you could do
[1:09:40] on a device we'll just use a phone for
[1:09:42] an example but it could also be a
[1:09:43] computer so on the left here we've got a
[1:09:46] wide openen phone there's no
[1:09:49] restrictions on it and way over on the
[1:09:51] right side we have no phone
[1:09:55] believe it or not I have known people
[1:09:58] that have gone to that
[1:10:00] level but if your faith is important to
[1:10:03] you you're going to do what it takes so
[1:10:04] what this will do for you is it's going
[1:10:06] to allow you to cycle through and try a
[1:10:10] level and if it's not working you can go
[1:10:12] up to the next level so the next level
[1:10:15] native filters what is already on your
[1:10:18] device that you can set up to manage
[1:10:20] your screen time to not go places you
[1:10:22] know you shouldn't go to not take the
[1:10:24] clickbait whatever it is is there's
[1:10:26] native filters then the next level up
[1:10:29] self monitoring with extra filters so
[1:10:31] you can get apps that will actually help
[1:10:33] you manage your device you can try that
[1:10:36] so you cycle through that nope it didn't
[1:10:38] work brother Mark I'm
[1:10:41] still
[1:10:44] failing takes a brave person to admit
[1:10:47] it monitoring with a partner okay I know
[1:10:51] people who have done this and there's
[1:10:54] apps that you can get well have some of
[1:10:55] them on the website where they'll pair
[1:10:58] you up with another person where you can
[1:10:59] kind of look over each other's
[1:11:02] shoulder see none of this is imposed on
[1:11:04] you you you decide to do this this is
[1:11:07] all your own choice we call it choose
[1:11:10] digital Holiness what do you want to be
[1:11:12] what's your
[1:11:13] goals outsourced
[1:11:16] monitoring putting the filtering
[1:11:18] controls into the hands of another
[1:11:21] person I am actually doing that for
[1:11:24] someone right now
[1:11:28] if I'm going to get another app on my
[1:11:31] phone brother Mark you have to put in
[1:11:33] the password before I can put it on so
[1:11:36] this person has to hand me their phone I
[1:11:38] put in the password what do you need
[1:11:40] this app for we have a little
[1:11:43] conversation we put it on they come back
[1:11:46] a week later and say brother Mark we got
[1:11:48] to take that up back off it's
[1:11:51] happened it's happened I have the
[1:11:54] humility to do do that but give another
[1:11:56] person that level of control how
[1:11:58] important is your faith to you to you
[1:12:01] you know if you're about to lose your
[1:12:03] salvation if you're if you're in a tail
[1:12:06] spin sometimes you have to get pretty
[1:12:08] radical to break these things because
[1:12:10] the addictions can be really strong the
[1:12:12] sanct ofh I came up with that little
[1:12:15] name there that's a phone that we don't
[1:12:17] have available yet but I hope to that
[1:12:20] you could order that's already um almost
[1:12:23] like a company would have restrictions
[1:12:25] on the phone out of the box that you've
[1:12:28] got to go through headquarters to change
[1:12:30] anything on it so they have those in
[1:12:32] businesses all the time I think it'd be
[1:12:34] great for families if there were such a
[1:12:36] thing and then all the way on the other
[1:12:39] side no phone at all I don't know where
[1:12:42] the what what did they call the one that
[1:12:43] you had the dumb the the Light phone the
[1:12:47] Light phone that just only does certain
[1:12:49] things you know you can't it's just a
[1:12:51] different device it's not a smartphone
[1:12:53] but it only does certain things
[1:12:55] I don't have that on here but that's
[1:12:57] another option you can
[1:13:01] do if nothing
[1:13:04] changes nothing changes so if you're not
[1:13:07] satisfied with how this is going for you
[1:13:10] if nothing changes nothing changes so we
[1:13:13] put this together so you can say okay
[1:13:16] it's not working maybe it's time for me
[1:13:18] to try another level this will work if
[1:13:23] you stay with it
[1:13:25] okay if you keep cycling through it
[1:13:27] you'll eventually get to an a level
[1:13:31] where it will work the only way it won't
[1:13:33] work is if you give
[1:13:35] up if you don't give up and you stay
[1:13:37] with it and keep cycling through at high
[1:13:41] levels higher and higher until I'm
[1:13:44] satisfied I'm overcoming then maybe
[1:13:46] you're building some strength what are
[1:13:48] we
[1:13:49] doing those scriptures we taking the
[1:13:52] Temptation level down
[1:13:56] who teaches you to do that the Holy
[1:13:59] Ghost this is how the Holy Ghost helps
[1:14:02] you
[1:14:03] overcome by avoiding those
[1:14:07] Temptations we're doing good we did this
[1:14:11] in our home Bible study laws versus
[1:14:15] disciplines two different things this
[1:14:18] whole presentation is on the disciplined
[1:14:22] side of the chart those are two
[1:14:24] different things
[1:14:25] laws are externally imposed disciplines
[1:14:29] are voluntarily
[1:14:30] chosen laws are mandatory disciplines
[1:14:34] are
[1:14:35] self-developed laws are formal
[1:14:38] disciplines are
[1:14:39] customizable to what's going to work for
[1:14:41] you laws are fixed disciplines are
[1:14:45] adaptable laws are enforced disciplines
[1:14:49] are
[1:14:51] self-regulated the purpose of laws are
[1:14:54] to EST establish and maintain order and
[1:14:57] fairness in a group the purpose of a
[1:15:00] discipline is to support growth and
[1:15:02] development toward your chosen
[1:15:08] goals I kind of like to throw in this
[1:15:11] this little question that's off the
[1:15:13] topic once in a
[1:15:15] while but when the Lord came and and
[1:15:19] brought a message to the
[1:15:21] world which of these categories was it
[1:15:24] in which of these two categories did
[1:15:27] Brother Branham operate in as he's
[1:15:29] bringing it to the world not going to
[1:15:31] answer it but it's an interesting thing
[1:15:33] to think about because the age of law is
[1:15:37] a past dispensation God isn't going
[1:15:40] backwards he's trying to grow us up as
[1:15:43] Sons and Daughters of God he wants us to
[1:15:46] volunteer into this Kingdom
[1:15:50] amen could it be that most of it is
[1:15:53] disciplines and we opt into it and we
[1:15:56] decide to do it because we have decided
[1:15:59] this is what we want to be it's our
[1:16:01] choice it's not imposed on
[1:16:07] us brother
[1:16:09] Mark how are we doing for time few more
[1:16:11] minutes yeah okay we're doing
[1:16:15] good this seems like a lot of
[1:16:18] work anyone go through
[1:16:21] college it's a lot of work right
[1:16:25] some things you just have to work for
[1:16:27] this seems like a lot of work let's just
[1:16:29] can't we just do a
[1:16:33] shortcut well let's go to one of the
[1:16:35] great Psalms in the Bible brother Mark
[1:16:38] why don't I just rely on the Lord to
[1:16:41] protect
[1:16:42] me he's good he like to protect his
[1:16:44] children let's go to Psalm 91 It's a
[1:16:47] Wonderful Psalm of
[1:16:50] protection you can see it on the screen
[1:16:52] you can look it up one of the greatest
[1:16:55] promises all the greatest many of the
[1:16:57] greatest Promises of protection in the
[1:17:00] Bible in Psalm
[1:17:04] 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place
[1:17:07] of the most high shall abide under the
[1:17:09] shadow of the Almighty I will say of the
[1:17:11] Lord he's my refuge in my Fortress my
[1:17:14] God in him I will trust so if you know
[1:17:17] the answer to this next question don't
[1:17:19] blurt it out so the question
[1:17:22] is this Psalm is quoted
[1:17:26] in the New Testament by
[1:17:28] which New Testament
[1:17:32] character this Psalm is quoted in the
[1:17:34] New Testament by a very important New
[1:17:37] Testament
[1:17:39] character
[1:17:41] who look at it real close did you see
[1:17:44] you have an
[1:17:46] idea David no it it'd be someone in the
[1:17:49] New Testament
[1:17:51] Jesus no not Jesus that's good though in
[1:17:56] Sunday school that's the answer to two
[1:17:58] out of three questions so that's always
[1:18:00] a good guess not
[1:18:02] Jesus it is quoted in the New Testament
[1:18:05] you know Pastor don't you okay was that
[1:18:09] yeah go ahead Satan exactly it's quoted
[1:18:15] by
[1:18:17] Satan to
[1:18:21] Jesus to him to entice him
[1:18:25] to rely upon the protection of
[1:18:30] God to voluntarily walk into a known
[1:18:36] danger he quoted Psalm 91 to
[1:18:42] him Satan was tempting Jesus to commit
[1:18:46] the sin of presumption presuming upon
[1:18:50] the protection of God to protect you
[1:18:54] from dangers that you could
[1:19:01] avoid and he was quoting it
[1:19:04] accurately but he's missing applying it
[1:19:07] to the
[1:19:09] situation this is one of the devil's big
[1:19:11] three he had three Temptations He had
[1:19:14] three pitches that he
[1:19:17] threw interesting that he would pick
[1:19:20] this one as one of the three if he could
[1:19:24] bring down Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:19:26] so it's got to be kind of tricky one
[1:19:28] that people stumble over
[1:19:31] frequently misunderstanding the
[1:19:34] protections of
[1:19:35] God to put yourself into a dangerous
[1:19:39] situation jump off the temple Jesus I've
[1:19:43] got a scripture stand on that
[1:19:47] scripture word of God is true right
[1:19:49] stand on that scripture don't you know
[1:19:52] the Lord will protect you and if Jesus
[1:19:55] had taken Satan's interpretation he
[1:19:57] would have
[1:19:59] jumped do we take Satan's
[1:20:04] interpretation
[1:20:06] no but if you are deliberately swimming
[1:20:09] next to a world
[1:20:11] poool will God protect
[1:20:15] you he
[1:20:17] might but you don't have a promise to
[1:20:20] stand on
[1:20:22] then he might be gracious and protect
[1:20:24] you for a
[1:20:26] while he might have to let you learn a
[1:20:28] lesson if you're walking into known
[1:20:32] dangers all over the Internet there are
[1:20:35] digital
[1:20:38] whirlpools and they want to suck you
[1:20:41] down brother Mark I'm just depending on
[1:20:43] the protection of the
[1:20:46] Lord the protection of the Lord will get
[1:20:49] you away from that thing that's right
[1:20:52] that's how he protects you he gets you
[1:20:54] away away from that thing he'll teach
[1:20:56] you not to swim there he doesn't give
[1:20:59] you blanket perect protection when you
[1:21:02] know there's a danger
[1:21:07] there all right oh we'll do that one in
[1:21:11] a minute anyone know Sister
[1:21:14] Brooke well you'll like to meet her
[1:21:16] someday wonderful
[1:21:18] sister um that's on the website you can
[1:21:21] look that over we hope to fill it out a
[1:21:23] little more but I encourage you to think
[1:21:25] about that do I need to move up a
[1:21:28] notch do I need to move up a notch am I
[1:21:31] serious about my faith am I serious
[1:21:33] about not swimming next to whirlpools
[1:21:35] that could drag me down and destroy my
[1:21:44] faith all right couple little things and
[1:21:47] then we'll be done sister Brooke um I'm
[1:21:51] sorry I don't have the video but um a
[1:21:54] lot of what you find on the internet is
[1:21:57] what we call impulse Temptations impulse
[1:22:00] Temptations are really interesting
[1:22:02] they're based on impulse Temptation
[1:22:04] something that you didn't have
[1:22:05] forethought about but somehow it just
[1:22:09] throws something at you that in the
[1:22:11] moment is kind of hard to resist and
[1:22:14] what they've learned about impulse
[1:22:16] Temptations is I I've actually
[1:22:18] researched this is an Impulse temp
[1:22:21] Temptation has a life of about 20 20
[1:22:27] seconds and in that 20 seconds it's
[1:22:30] really
[1:22:31] strong but if you can get past the 20
[1:22:35] seconds it Fizzles out so a lot of the
[1:22:38] failings that happened happen in that
[1:22:41] moment so we created the Philippians 4:8
[1:22:44] block let's turn to
[1:22:46] it it takes about 20 seconds to quote
[1:22:50] Philippians 4:8 wow had a nice gentle
[1:22:56] pace so if you become a clickto
[1:23:00] maniac and you just can't help but click
[1:23:03] on that you need a block you need a 20
[1:23:05] second Block in that 20 seconds you can
[1:23:08] get away from that click too so this is
[1:23:10] your
[1:23:11] Escape we actually had a lot of the
[1:23:14] young people record themselves and send
[1:23:16] us a video of them reading Philippians
[1:23:19] 48 we've posted some of them on the
[1:23:22] website and do it nicely and do it
[1:23:24] energetically or do it creatively or do
[1:23:26] it with your personality or do it
[1:23:28] hanging upside down from a tree like one
[1:23:31] sister did but Philippians 4:8 it's the
[1:23:34] Temptation blocker did anyone find it
[1:23:37] any Vol anyone volunteer to stand up and
[1:23:39] read it for
[1:23:41] us is your Temptation block I have to
[1:23:45] volunteer
[1:23:46] somebody okay finally Breen whatsoever
[1:23:50] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:23:52] honest whatever are
[1:24:08] amen amen so in that moment so you're in
[1:24:11] that moment and recognize it okay I'm in
[1:24:14] that moment grab your block Philippians
[1:24:16] 4:8 read it or have it
[1:24:19] memorized you'll get down you
[1:24:22] go this isn't so hard and you're on to
[1:24:25] something else and you didn't stumble in
[1:24:27] something that could have just took you
[1:24:29] down a Whirlpool of something really bad
[1:24:32] but you need that little block when
[1:24:34] Jesus blocked The Temptations of the
[1:24:36] devil what did he
[1:24:38] use scripture yeah so it works it really
[1:24:43] does work I knew one brother that
[1:24:45] actually he identified the
[1:24:49] place the room in the
[1:24:52] house where the problem usually happen
[1:24:55] happened and on the door he printed the
[1:24:58] words finally
[1:25:00] Brethren so as soon as you're headed
[1:25:02] into that room okay that whole scripture
[1:25:05] is running through his mind
[1:25:09] so that's what we're doing when we talk
[1:25:11] about tools and tactics it's little
[1:25:14] things like that that you need to have
[1:25:17] to survive this battle and they're in
[1:25:20] the scripture I'll show you one more uh
[1:25:23] then another little thing then we have a
[1:25:24] song for you we'll be about
[1:25:27] done um one of the the great stumbling
[1:25:30] grounds for a lot of people is
[1:25:34] YouTube and there's a little thing you
[1:25:36] can get called YouTube DF so it's a um
[1:25:40] it goes on your Chrome browser and what
[1:25:44] it does is it takes away all the
[1:25:47] recommendations because the way that
[1:25:49] YouTube works of course we know you put
[1:25:51] one thing in and it shows 10 other
[1:25:55] things you might like if you're trying
[1:25:57] to learn how to cook something or fix
[1:25:59] your car and you're only looking for one
[1:26:01] thing and 20 minutes later you're into
[1:26:04] several videos and then you go how did I
[1:26:05] get here because it showed them to you
[1:26:08] but if you put this extension on your
[1:26:10] browser only the thing that you look for
[1:26:12] will come up so you aren't getting the
[1:26:15] recommendations
[1:26:17] Temptation avoidance and it's
[1:26:21] free so there's there's different ones
[1:26:24] this is one DFD DTU distraction free for
[1:26:28] for YouTube but there's different ones
[1:26:29] that kind of do the same thing actually
[1:26:32] what I did for a while is I turned my
[1:26:34] phone into black and white you can
[1:26:36] actually take the color out of it and
[1:26:38] then it's less appealing then you spend
[1:26:40] less time there just little practical
[1:26:43] things like that can really help you get
[1:26:45] that wrestle that thing down get it
[1:26:47] under
[1:26:49] control um for people who are Really
[1:26:52] Brave and only a couple people have done
[1:26:55] this but there's a chapter on it in the
[1:26:57] book we call it the 30-day digital
[1:27:02] detox and what is that it's exactly what
[1:27:05] you think it
[1:27:06] is you notify everybody you're going to
[1:27:09] have to get a hold of me some other way
[1:27:10] if you want to because I'm taking
[1:27:13] everything out for 30
[1:27:15] days except what I need for for safety
[1:27:17] or income it's absolute necessity but I
[1:27:20] am completely off of everything for 30
[1:27:23] days
[1:27:25] sometimes see the people have done this
[1:27:27] and I know a few of them that
[1:27:30] have it's sometimes easier to build up
[1:27:34] from a clean
[1:27:35] slate starting from nothing than to try
[1:27:39] to pick one thing out one at a
[1:27:43] time so after 30 days and we know it
[1:27:46] takes about 30 days to defeat an
[1:27:48] addiction and most of the pull of it is
[1:27:50] gone they can reevaluate and okay oh
[1:27:53] what do I read really
[1:27:55] need and they only bring that back into
[1:27:57] their life so the people have have done
[1:28:01] this say you know
[1:28:02] it's it's amazing to
[1:28:06] realize how much of a pull it had on you
[1:28:10] that's the Revelation they get this had
[1:28:12] a much bigger pull on me than I realized
[1:28:15] until I was away from a while and then
[1:28:17] it's like almost like waking up from a
[1:28:19] dream oh the real world is here I didn't
[1:28:21] realize all this is here and the other
[1:28:23] thing is I was so busy before I just
[1:28:25] couldn't get everything done and now I
[1:28:27] have all this time see time is getting
[1:28:30] sucked away stolen there's a thief out
[1:28:34] there a Time Thief that's right you
[1:28:37] don't gain anything from it it's just
[1:28:38] stealing your life
[1:28:41] away um so that's two tools and uh we
[1:28:47] like to have people involved in this
[1:28:49] ministry you can subscribe if you want
[1:28:52] to but if you come up with something
[1:28:53] that really works and you want to share
[1:28:56] with others that's really helped me we'd
[1:28:58] like to have those things
[1:29:00] too um and we'll just have a repository
[1:29:03] of of support so we don't want to fight
[1:29:06] this battle alone see that that's what
[1:29:08] the platforms want they want you on your
[1:29:11] own the devil is like a roaring lion
[1:29:14] seeking whom he may devour but the the
[1:29:16] lion doesn't attack the whole herd it
[1:29:19] attacks the Stray he's trying to get you
[1:29:23] on your own you're a lot easier to
[1:29:25] defeat so if you work on this together
[1:29:27] and we're all supporting each other so
[1:29:30] we can defeat
[1:29:32] this wow this is amazing you guys did so
[1:29:35] good you're so
[1:29:37] quiet what we known for that's what
[1:29:39] you're known for
[1:29:43] tring you know they're really known for
[1:29:45] being noisy in South America but I on
[1:29:48] that night they were quiet though I
[1:29:49] don't know if they were exhausted or
[1:29:51] what stay but they they stayed away wait
[1:29:54] then we had a little uh time for
[1:29:56] questions and answers afterwards and
[1:29:58] they had some really great questions uh
[1:30:01] we have a song for you I guess could we
[1:30:03] take anyone just has a question you're
[1:30:05] dying to ask or a comment or some
[1:30:08] insight we'll do a little song for you
[1:30:10] and then that'll be enough for tonight I
[1:30:12] think you can take a question if you
[1:30:15] have one if you don't that's
[1:30:20] okay I sprung it on you I didn't tell
[1:30:22] you to have a there there be questions
[1:30:24] later on maybe I'll have a follow-up
[1:30:27] meeting after I'm gone brother Daniel
[1:30:30] and they'll have a little more
[1:30:31] discussion about
[1:30:34] it yes
[1:30:42] sister well the smartphones are much
[1:30:44] more
[1:30:45] dangerous because of the apps and uh
[1:30:49] their ability to access the internet so
[1:30:52] that they they can have a lot more
[1:30:54] ability to get you um capture your
[1:30:59] spirit I'll put it that
[1:31:01] way
[1:31:05] so well we could everything is a
[1:31:08] smartphone now but there are some phones
[1:31:09] that you know what the other one would
[1:31:11] be a flip phone that all it does is dial
[1:31:13] so you can talk to someone in voice call
[1:31:17] but all right any anything else comments
[1:31:20] questions or flowers or bricks
[1:31:27] have you have you heard of the book
[1:31:28] digital minimalism by yes yeah I've
[1:31:32] studied a lot of C stuff and he's one of
[1:31:35] the one that kind of started this
[1:31:37] digital uh detox idea with college
[1:31:39] students a lot of their experiences are
[1:31:41] in his books too yep digital minimalism
[1:31:46] yep y That's a good
[1:31:48] one so even the world is is figuring out
[1:31:51] some of these things in fact there are
[1:31:53] schools I've I've heard about him
[1:31:54] recently where the whole school is
[1:31:56] detoxing
[1:31:58] together and communities and people not
[1:32:02] even Believers not even Christians just
[1:32:04] recognizing that it's not doing anything
[1:32:06] good for them well if the world can do
[1:32:09] that I think churches could probably do
[1:32:10] that too right we should be ahead of the
[1:32:13] game not behind
[1:32:16] so our song we're going to do today is
[1:32:19] based on um Psalm 91 secret place so
[1:32:24] we'll have Josiah and Katie and my wife
[1:32:26] come up we'll do a little song for you
