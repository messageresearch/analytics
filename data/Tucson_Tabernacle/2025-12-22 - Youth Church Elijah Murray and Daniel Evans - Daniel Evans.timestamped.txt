[9:25] Amen.
[9:28] Down from his glory. Amen. We're going
[9:30] to take the requests at this time. We
[9:32] didn't have any specific written ones in
[9:36] except for the Daniel Junior's headed to
[9:38] Phoenix here in a little bit. So, just
[9:40] pray for traveling mercies
[9:42] for him as he travels up there. I
[9:46] appreciate traveling mercies. Seems like
[9:48] lately we've just been driving and just
[9:51] so many accidents around us and just
[9:55] people not paying attention. We were
[9:56] driving down here asto this morning and
[9:58] a guy was just walking down the middle
[10:00] of the road and he was so in the middle
[10:01] I couldn't decide whether I go around
[10:03] him on the left or the right. So I just
[10:04] kind of went slower and slower and
[10:06] slower until he was 5t from our hood and
[10:10] then he looked up and was like, "Oh,
[10:11] you're you're there." So
[10:14] it's the Lord's gracious and merciful to
[10:16] us. Amen. So that's the only request I
[10:19] have is traveling mercies for brother
[10:22] Daniel Jr. Let's stand this evening.
[10:23] We're going to sing Jesus Loves Me. This
[10:25] I know. And uh Asher's going to come
[10:31] and I'm sorry. Liam's going to come and
[10:34] he's going to pray over the prayer
[10:36] requests tonight. He doesn't want to
[10:38] anymore.

[22:29] [singing]
[22:33] This one right here is going to work.
[22:37] I'm happy. Wow. This is this an exciting
[22:40] time.
[22:42] Our first youth church and they've done
[22:45] a great job so far.
[22:48] And now
[22:50] I have a little testimony to share
[22:51] before we get started.
[22:54] I was praying this morning. I was
[22:56] getting ready my service early early
[22:59] this morning. I leaned back in my chair
[23:02] and I had asked Elijah
[23:05] if he would minister a little bit for us
[23:09] this coming Sunday night to to the
[23:11] youth. And uh he said no.
[23:18] And he didn't even give it any give it
[23:20] any thought. He was resolute.
[23:23] He said no. And I said, "Okay." I said,
[23:26] "You sure?"
[23:28] And he said, "Yeah."
[23:31] Okay. So that was when was that? What?
[23:34] Was that on Wednesday
[23:36] or maybe last Sunday? I think it was
[23:38] like maybe Wednesday or something. Then
[23:40] this morning, early in the morning,
[23:43] I
[23:45] sitting back in my chair.
[23:48] I said, "You know what? I think I'm
[23:51] going to ask Elijah. Will I really need
[23:54] some help?
[23:56] Because we really need a minister on
[23:58] Sunday night. And I think I'm just gonna
[24:01] ask him, will he will he do it? Will he
[24:03] do it for me?" Because he loves boy.
[24:06] Really loves Pastor Daniel. And uh so I
[24:12] get to church and I I was back in in the
[24:15] back back here and as I was walking this
[24:19] way, Elijah came walking in and didn't
[24:22] even greet me. Greet me. He said,
[24:24] "Pastor, I want to do it."
[24:27] Okay, very good. Because I was going to
[24:29] ask you. I felt like the Lord wanted you
[24:31] to to minister this evening. So,
[24:33] brother, now the next step. Do you want
[24:36] to open in prayer and have the people
[24:37] seated or would you like to have them
[24:39] seated now? What would you like to do?
[24:44] &gt;&gt; They can be seated. Okay, you can be
[24:46] seated.
[24:49] Let's make sure your microphone's
[24:51] working good.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; All right.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Just talk.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; It sounds like it's working.
[25:04] You need water. There's your water.
[25:09] Feel good. All right. My good friend
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Elijah Murray is going to bring the
[25:16] message for us this.
[25:20] [applause]
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads for prayer?
[25:30] Lord, we thank you for everything you've
[25:32] done. Bless the people out there, the
[25:36] people that don't love you.
[25:39] Can you please bless them to to love
[25:41] you, Lord? Lord, we love we love you and
[25:45] you love them. The people that don't
[25:48] love you, you love them so much. You
[25:50] love every creation that you created.
[25:54] It's when you build something and you
[25:56] just love it. you'll keep it forever
[25:59] safe in your heart.
[26:01] Lord, we just ask if you could bless
[26:04] this church, bless everyone in it in
[26:06] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[26:10] [applause]
[26:15] &gt;&gt; And I was going to say that I hope that
[26:19] you can get a
[26:22] good feeling when I say this.
[26:25] I would want I want to share a message
[26:29] called just one drop.
[26:32] And the scripture that's first up is
[26:35] Luke 16:24.
[26:39] The rich man shouted, "Father Abraham,
[26:42] have some pity. send Lazarus
[26:46] over here to dip
[26:50] the tip of his finger in water and cool
[26:54] my tongue.
[26:56] I am in anguish
[26:59] and those flame in those flames.
[27:03] And what I like about that scripture is
[27:07] he just it's like just one drop from the
[27:10] finger. he wants like it's just one
[27:13] drop.
[27:14] And the next scripture I would like to
[27:16] share is John 7:38.
[27:22] He that believes in me as the scripture
[27:28] that said out of his belly shall flow
[27:31] rivers.
[27:34] Jesus living water, holy holy spirit.
[27:38] And that's one.
[27:40] And the last scripture is Matthew 11:28.
[27:47] That labor and are heavy laden and I
[27:54] will give you rest.
[27:58] Take my wait. Take my
[28:05] yoke upon you and [sighs]
[28:08] learn of me for I am
[28:13] mean
[28:15] meek and lonely
[28:18] in heart
[28:22] and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
[28:27] For my burden is
[28:30] light
[28:32] light. [applause]
[28:39] Now,
[28:41] all right. I'm going to take your notes.
[28:43] I want you to stand in front of this
[28:48] podium here and I want you to tell all
[28:51] of us how special the Lord Jesus is to
[28:54] you and what he means to you. Okay?
[28:58] stand.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I would like to say that the Lord
[29:06] is a blessing. He'll always be a
[29:09] blessing to all of you. And I trust him.
[29:14] I believe in him. He's helped me
[29:16] countless times. He's helped my father.
[29:19] He's helped He's helped Pastor Dan. He's
[29:22] helped every single one of you. He's
[29:25] helped my mother a lot. And how special
[29:28] that love is [snorts] is like
[29:32] so much love that we can't we don't
[29:35] compare.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; His love is just
[29:40] outstanding.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; And we love him so much that
[29:46] he loves us so much that he died on that
[29:48] sins for us.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; We should have paid the price, not him.
[29:54] Amen.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; So I'm just saying Jesus loves us so
[29:58] much that he was sacrificed his own life
[30:01] for us.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:04] God, [applause]
[30:09] &gt;&gt; that was good. It should have been us
[30:12] that died on that cross, but it was him
[30:15] because he loves us. Amen. Good job. Do

[31:22] might from sin be free,
[31:27] bled and died upon the tree.
[31:32] Yes,
[31:34] Jesus loves me.

[37:14] &gt;&gt; Praise him when the sun goes down.
[37:18] [singing]
[37:19] &gt;&gt; My name
[37:21] this evening is Matthew. I was going to
[37:25] come out as Luke, but we didn't have
[37:29] Luke's outfit.
[37:32] So, this is Matthew. That was supposed
[37:34] to be funny because we don't know the
[37:36] difference in their outfits.
[37:39] So
[37:41] in speaking from the point from the
[37:45] perspective of Matthew
[37:48] what I will be talking about this
[37:49] evening and I would like for the young
[37:52] people to help me. So the way that we
[37:55] used to do this thing in my time is I
[37:58] would take a seat here because I am the
[38:02] one ministering and then all of you
[38:04] would come up here. So, all the young
[38:06] people, come on up here. And I want you
[38:08] up here.
[38:11] Stay there. Yeah. Come on.
[38:16] Everyone under
[38:18] 16. Come on.
[38:21] Come on. No, no, no. What are you facing
[38:22] them for? I'm the important one here.
[38:25] Come on up here and sit.
[38:29] Yeah. So, the way that we did it in
[38:32] Bible time, now you got to face this
[38:33] way, Abraham.
[38:35] The way that we did it in Bible time is
[38:38] you can sit Indian style,
[38:40] you can sit with your feet out or
[38:42] sometimes you can just sit like this.
[38:45] All right?
[38:47] So just relax.
[38:50] So again, my name
[38:53] is Matthew.
[38:56] Not like that. Liam,
[39:00] &gt;&gt; you can be seated. Parents, I'm sorry.
[39:04] Thank you. Abraham, sit up.
[39:07] So,
[39:10] if I am Matthew,
[39:12] tell me what
[39:15] was my job before I met Jesus? You have
[39:19] to raise your hand to give an answer.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:24] Fisherman. No.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Tax collector.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Tax collector. Yeah. Yeah. So, Matthew,
[39:32] what you didn't know about Matthew in
[39:34] the Bible is he liked candy.
[39:38] And when and when you get a question
[39:40] right, you get a piece of candy. All
[39:42] right.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; So, what I wanted to do is I wanted to
[39:47] talk about
[39:49] the birth of the Lord Jesus.
[39:53] I was a tax collector and Jesus walked
[39:58] by my tax collecting booth one day and
[40:01] guess what he said? Raise your hand.
[40:07] He said, "Oh."
[40:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come follow me." And you know
[40:12] what I did? I left my booth and I went
[40:16] and I followed the Lord Jesus. I knew
[40:19] there was something special about him.
[40:22] So I also knew that
[40:26] it was my going to be one day my job to
[40:30] write a book, write a letter
[40:35] about this man, Jesus,
[40:38] because I wanted all the world to know
[40:41] about this man.
[40:43] So I started watching Jesus closely
[40:48] and I was watching how he would do
[40:51] things. And one of the things that that
[40:56] intrigued me
[40:59] was that Jesus
[41:01] was from the lineage from the tribe of
[41:07] who? Raise your hand.
[41:10] from the tribe of Judah, right?
[41:14] He came from the tribe of Judah.
[41:17] And who else is from that tribe of
[41:20] Judah?
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Matthew.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; No,
[41:27] &gt;&gt; David. Right. So, David was from this
[41:32] tribe of Judah. So, I like numbers.
[41:35] Okay? And if you'll watch in my book,
[41:38] there are a lot of numbers. And there
[41:40] are a lot of lineage there. So if you
[41:44] look from
[41:46] Abraham
[41:48] down to David,
[41:51] there are a certain number of
[41:54] generations. Does anybody know how many
[41:55] generations there are?
[41:59] No.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; 100? No.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; You're getting closer. No. Now you're
[42:07] getting farther away.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[42:10] N
[42:10] &gt;&gt; 200.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; 14.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, look at you, Bianca. How did you
[42:16] know that there were 14 generations?
[42:18] &gt;&gt; I just say it. The last Christmas
[42:19] players.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Very good. Give Bianca [applause] a
[42:22] hand.
[42:24] That's why we have Christmas plays so we
[42:27] can learn. So there were 14 generations
[42:30] from Abraham to David. And then from
[42:33] David there were a certain number of
[42:35] generations to the Babylonian captivity.
[42:38] Can anybody guess how many generations
[42:40] there were from that, Liam?
[42:44] &gt;&gt; 14, right? Good job, buddy. All right.
[42:48] And then from the Babylonian captivity,
[42:51] I'm going to ask one of you. From the
[42:52] Babylonian captivity
[42:54] to Jesus, guess how many re how many
[42:57] generations there were?
[42:58] &gt;&gt; 14.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; No. Yes. But I asked them, 14, right?
[43:04] 14. Right. There were 14 generations. 14
[43:08] 14 14 generations from Abraham
[43:12] to to David.
[43:14] Do you does anybody know what a
[43:16] generation is?
[43:27] So I from me to my son Daniel is one
[43:32] generation. Okay. So from from brother
[43:35] Paul to Elijah is one generation. Then
[43:40] from brother Paul to his parents is a
[43:43] generation. So every time you have a
[43:45] family like you said is a generation. 14
[43:50] generations from Abraham
[43:52] to David. 14 generations from David to
[43:56] the Babylonian captivity. Okay, I said
[43:58] Babylonian captivity. Who knows what the
[44:00] Babylonian captivity is? Is he?
[44:06] They did. It was captivity. It was the
[44:09] kingdom that came in and took over
[44:11] Judah.
[44:13] But
[44:15] who was that meanspirited king that did
[44:18] it?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. Right. Very, very good.
[44:22] Nebuchadnezzar.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; I read that.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; You read that, too? Huh?
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Well, then you need you need
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Don't eat them right here. This we're in
[44:31] church. We can't eat in church. What?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; I was going to say the captivity that
[44:35] took me and
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Shadrach.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Shadrach.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; And what was the prophet's name that was
[44:45] in the Babylonian captivity?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Shadrach.
[44:50] That was his buddies, his friends.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Daniel.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Daniel, right? Did you already get
[44:56] candy?
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're in church. You know what?
[45:02] I'm gonna I'm gonna give it I'm going to
[45:04] give it to Jenny.
[45:06] All right. [laughter]
[45:08] So, then we have from the Babylonian
[45:10] captivity to Jesus, we have another 14
[45:12] generations. So, I studied this
[45:16] &gt;&gt; and I Nope. No Indian church. So I
[45:18] studied this
[45:20] generations and I saw all these very
[45:23] very interesting things and I saw that
[45:26] the prophets had prophesied that the
[45:28] Messiah would come from the line of
[45:31] Judah. So that that really intrigued me.
[45:35] So now I'm looking at this man Jesus and
[45:40] I see that he's very special. I see that
[45:42] he is really what I think is the
[45:44] Messiah. But there was a prophecy that
[45:47] we talked about this morning
[45:50] that was very, very interesting to me.
[45:54] And it was a prophecy that I saw that
[45:56] had never been fulfilled.
[45:59] It was a prophecy by this prophet named
[46:03] Isaiah.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can anybody tell me what the
[46:10] prophecy is he?
[46:19] unto you.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, left out part of it. You're
[46:26] right. But left out part of this.
[46:30] So Isaiah said that there would be born
[46:36] a baby
[46:39] from a woman
[46:42] that had never been with a man.
[46:46] This would be a a baby born of a virgin.
[46:51] So you know the story behind that.
[46:54] Let me let me tell you the story. So
[46:57] what happened was there was this king of
[47:00] Israel. You're not going to know this.
[47:04] How about any of the adults? Does any do
[47:06] any of the adults, any of the parents or
[47:08] families know what the king's name was
[47:11] that was king when Isaiah gave the
[47:13] prophecy that a virgin would conceive?
[47:16] Does anybody know?
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Nerd Aaron the
[47:19] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. We got We're asking the
[47:21] parents now. Anybody? You get a piece of
[47:24] candy. Anybody?
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Hezekiah is a good good guess, but no,
[47:32] it wasn't.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Anybody? Come on. Moms and dads and
[47:39] &gt;&gt; grandpas and grandmas.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; This king. The king's name.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Let me make sure I'm right. And I am
[47:48] because Matthew's [snorts] always right.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; This king's name was Ahaz.
[47:53] And what had happened with Ahaz the king
[47:57] is he was afraid.
[47:59] Do you know what he was afraid of?
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Daniel.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; No. What was happening to his kingdom?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; It was getting like
[48:07] &gt;&gt; No, not yet.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Anybody is he?
[48:12] &gt;&gt; He was afraid that someone would take
[48:15] this place.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Ahaz Ahaz was afraid. Does any How about
[48:20] any of the parents? Do you know what was
[48:22] going on? Why King Ahaz was afraid?
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Okay, now I'm now I'm just gonna I'm
[48:29] gonna tell the story now because I'm
[48:32] Matthew.
[48:34] Matthew tells stories. You know who else
[48:35] tells stories? Mark and Luke and John.
[48:38] All the disciples like to tell stories
[48:40] about Jesus. This is a story. It's a
[48:42] true story. Back way back in the Bible
[48:46] in the book of Isaiah. The king Ahaz was
[48:50] afraid because he was the king of
[48:52] Jerusalem
[48:54] and there was an army forming against
[48:57] him.
[48:59] And it was two countries that made a
[49:03] deal with each other. It was the country
[49:05] of Syria
[49:07] &gt;&gt; and it was the country of Israel. So
[49:10] remember Israel and Judah had split
[49:13] apart.
[49:14] Judah was Was Judah in the north or the
[49:18] south? Who hasn't who hasn't got candy
[49:19] yet?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; I didn't.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. Was Judah in the north or the
[49:24] south?
[49:26] In the south?
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Judah was in the south.
[49:35] Israel was where?
[49:37] &gt;&gt; In the north. Right. So we have Israel
[49:40] in the north. Judah in the south and
[49:44] Israel makes a deal with this creepy
[49:48] king of Syria and they are going to come
[49:51] in and they are going to invade
[49:54] Jerusalem. All right. Invade me. What
[49:58] does invade mean?
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Like if Yeah. Right. Say it again.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:11] Exactly. Good job. Invade means to take
[50:15] over.
[50:17] So this army was forming between these
[50:20] two kingdoms. The one
[50:23] &gt;&gt; what's their name?
[50:26] &gt;&gt; You want to know the name?
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Syria.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Syria. And who is the king of Syria?
[50:31] Nobody knows.
[50:33] Anybody knows? Reason
[50:36] like candy kind of not spelled that way
[50:38] but reason. And there was this other the
[50:42] son of the king of Israel his name was
[50:44] Pah. So they make this deal and they are
[50:47] going to invade
[50:49] um Jerusalem and they are and this king
[50:52] Ahaz he's afraid. So he goes so the
[50:56] prophet
[50:58] comes to him comes to the king who
[51:02] hasn't got candy yet.
[51:04] You haven't got candy. What was the
[51:05] prophet's name? I just said it. I said
[51:07] it a while ago.
[51:11] Look at you. Good job.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Right. Isaiah was the prophet. He goes
[51:18] to the king Ahaz and he says, "Listen,"
[51:22] he says, "God is going to protect you."
[51:25] All right, you with me? He says, "No,
[51:28] you're you're strong. You're going to be
[51:29] able to get out of this. God is going to
[51:32] protect you from these two kings that
[51:33] are coming down." So the king Ahaz,
[51:38] he tells the Lord tells Ahaz to seek
[51:42] after a sign. You know what a sign is?
[51:47] &gt;&gt; A spiritual sign.
[51:49] A spiritual sign is something that God
[51:52] gives that doesn't usually happen. So
[51:55] there was this man I I'll tell you what
[51:57] a sign is. There was this man named
[51:59] Gideon. One time he was seeking a sign
[52:01] from God and he said, ' Lord, if this is
[52:03] your will, then I'm going to lay out
[52:06] this piece of sheepkin and if the dew
[52:10] comes on the ground and not the sheep
[52:12] skin, then I'll know it's you. Well, it
[52:14] did. The dew came on the ground and not
[52:15] the sheep skin. So then he says, well,
[52:18] let me just want I want to make sure I
[52:20] want another sign that let the dew come
[52:22] on the sheepkin and not the ground. God
[52:25] did both. So that's a sign. So the Lord
[52:29] tells this king Ahaz, he says, "So seek
[52:31] after a sign." He says, "A big sign.
[52:34] Anything that you ask for and I am going
[52:37] to do it." Well, the king was afraid.
[52:40] He says, "No, I don't want to seek after
[52:42] a sign. I'm kind of I don't want to test
[52:45] the Lord."
[52:47] And then the prophet
[52:49] tells Isaiah,
[52:51] he says, "The Lord will send you a
[52:55] sign."
[52:56] You with me?
[52:58] He said, "A virgin will conceive
[53:02] and bear a son
[53:04] and his name will be called Emmanuel."
[53:08] All right.
[53:10] So,
[53:12] Matthew, as I am studying this, the Lord
[53:16] protected Ahaz,
[53:18] but I never saw this sign ever
[53:23] fulfilled, this prophecy. Way back
[53:26] hundreds of years, it didn't happen.
[53:29] So, when is God going to give this sign?
[53:33] And when I heard the story of Jesus,
[53:37] I saw that The prophecy was not
[53:41] fulfilled with Ahaz, but it was
[53:44] fulfilled with this man Jesus. This
[53:47] baby, remember, who was born in a manger
[53:52] and his mother had never been with a
[53:56] man. So 7 800 years, right? And his name
[54:00] was Jesus. And he was called
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Say it louder.
[54:08] And what does Emanuel mean?
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Christ,
[54:13] &gt;&gt; it means God with us.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; And that was the fulfillment. So, as I
[54:19] see I'm I'm I'm studying and
[54:23] I see that this wasn't fulfilled in
[54:25] Isaiah. But when I wrote it down in my
[54:29] book of Isaiah when I first started the
[54:32] book, I wanted the people to know that
[54:34] this was the prophecy that wasn't
[54:37] fulfilled with Ahaz. This was the
[54:39] prophecy that the prophet gave. This was
[54:42] fulfilled in this man Jesus. Are you
[54:44] with me?
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[54:47] very very important.
[54:50] What questions do you have for me,
[54:52] Matthew,
[54:54] about anything?
[54:57] &gt;&gt; How long did you live?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; How long did I live? Well, I didn't live
[55:02] very long.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, how long did Jesus live? Jesus
[55:07] &gt;&gt; on the earth, Jesus lived about 33
[55:09] years. But how long did I live? Me,
[55:12] Matthew, I didn't live very long. So
[55:15] after Jesus went up to be with the
[55:18] father, after he was he was crucified
[55:23] and he rose after the third day and he
[55:25] went up to be with the father, I started
[55:27] preaching.
[55:28] All right? I preached around in in
[55:32] Jerusalem there and then I went to a far
[55:35] away land and this king
[55:41] wanted to marry this young girl
[55:44] and I told him you are sinning and I
[55:47] said it in front of everyone and that
[55:49] king had me killed
[55:52] because I stood for Jesus and that's how
[55:54] Matthew died. Yeah. Next question.
[55:57] You got
[55:59] &gt;&gt; You could tell me how I got healed.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Killed. How did I get killed?
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Got beheaded.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Matthew, I want to remember if I got
[56:09] beheaded or not.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus lived 33 years old till they
[56:20] killed a mother.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Let's see. Joseph, how old are you?
[56:25] &gt;&gt; 30. So everybody turn around and look at
[56:27] brother Joseph. Jesus was just barely
[56:30] older than him when he was put to death
[56:33] on the cross. Okay, turn back and look
[56:35] at me. Any other questions from for
[56:37] Matthew?
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Anybody?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Chloe,
[56:46] &gt;&gt; I did. They're not in the Bible,
[56:50] but I wanted to tell everybody about
[56:52] Jesus. I wanted to tell every about
[56:55] buddy about my experience
[56:57] with with this man. I wanted to tell
[56:59] everyone how he did all of these
[57:01] miracles. I wanted to tell everyone that
[57:03] if you just go back and you look at the
[57:04] Old Testament that you can find Jesus in
[57:08] the Old Testament like I did in Isaiah
[57:11] where this this prophecy that was given
[57:13] by Isaiah was fulfilled when Jesus was
[57:15] born in the manger. I wanted to tell
[57:17] everybody. So, Chloe, yeah, I did. I
[57:19] wanted to tell everybody. But my letter
[57:23] was in was in this book. And guess what
[57:26] language I wrote it in?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hebrew.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; That's a good answer because you would
[57:32] think I wrote it in Hebrew. Right.
[57:34] Right.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; But I didn't write it in Hebrew.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Greek. Greek.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; I wrote it in Greek. Does anybody know
[57:42] why I wrote my letter in Greek?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Because you were Greek.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; No, I was not Greek. I was Hebrew.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Adam.
[57:50] Greek as Adams. Did you get candy yet?
[57:53] Okay. As Adam said, Greek was the common
[57:57] language. So I wrote my letter not in
[57:59] Hebrew so all the all the Jews could
[58:01] read it. I read it. I wrote it in Greek
[58:04] so it could go around the world and
[58:06] other people who didn't speak Hebrew,
[58:09] but almost everybody spoke Greek could
[58:11] read it. Have you ever heard of
[58:15] evangelism?
[58:17] evangelist.
[58:19] I was an evangelist. I went out and told
[58:24] people about Jesus. That was what I did
[58:26] after. And I preached it in Greek
[58:29] because they spoke Greek. Izzy,
[58:31] question.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Why do I think that my book comes first?
[58:39] Because it's the best.
[58:42] Next qu [laughter]
[58:45] the the reason I think that Matthew's
[58:48] book comes first.
[58:50] Now I wrote my book and it's very very
[58:53] well researched and I was there when
[58:55] Jesus did all of these things. So, it's
[58:57] a very very important book. But the
[59:00] reason that my book is first
[59:03] is probably because
[59:06] Mark,
[59:08] he was with us
[59:10] and then Luke, they all go in the same
[59:14] order.
[59:16] And mine, because it's probably the most
[59:19] comprehensive,
[59:21] mine is first. But the reason John's is
[59:26] last is because it goes in a different
[59:29] order. Still just as true as mine is,
[59:33] but John's is a little bit different.
[59:35] The other ones are
[59:38] pretty well. They're the same, just
[59:40] different perspectives, but John's has a
[59:42] much different perspective. John does a
[59:44] little bit more preaching than we did.
[59:47] Question.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; How did you get killed?
[59:49] &gt;&gt; I you already answered that. I don't
[59:52] really remember, but it was because I
[59:53] told that king that he shouldn't be
[59:55] living bad. Yeah.
[1:00:00] What was my favorite I scripture I
[1:00:02] wrote?
[1:00:05] Let me think.
[1:00:10] You know, I wrote in my 10th chapter,
[1:00:14] I wrote, "He that receives a prophet
[1:00:19] in the name of a prophet
[1:00:22] shall receive a prophet's reward, and he
[1:00:25] that receives a righteous man in the
[1:00:27] name of a righteous man shall receive a
[1:00:30] righteous man's reward." So when I
[1:00:33] receive
[1:00:35] someone, I get the blessings of being
[1:00:38] friends with them. If I receive a
[1:00:39] prophet, I get the blessings of being
[1:00:40] with a prophet or accepting a prophet.
[1:00:43] If I receive a good man or a good a good
[1:00:45] woman, if I if I'm their friend, then I
[1:00:47] get the benefit of that. But as I think
[1:00:50] about it, I think it's one of the last
[1:00:52] things I wrote. Who you did you ask it
[1:00:54] or did Chloe ask it? You asked it.
[1:00:57] In my very end of my book, I wrote, you
[1:01:01] know what? Let me read it.
[1:01:04] It's pretty cool reading your own
[1:01:06] writing.
[1:01:08] Matthew chapter 28:1 19
[1:01:11] says this,
[1:01:15] "Go ye therefore and teach all nations."
[1:01:18] All right. Teach them what?
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; About Jesus.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; How do I know that? Because of the next
[1:01:28] verse. Bapt baptizing them in the name
[1:01:31] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:01:34] holy ghost. And then what did we do when
[1:01:36] we went and baptized?
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; We washed them out.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; We baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:46] But what I was saying here, baptizing
[1:01:49] them in the name of the father and of
[1:01:51] the son and of the holy ghost, I was
[1:01:53] saying that you need to baptize in the
[1:01:56] name of God. And what is the name of
[1:01:59] God?
[1:02:00] Jesus.
[1:02:02] teaching them to observe all things
[1:02:04] whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo,
[1:02:07] I am with you always, even unto the end
[1:02:09] of the world. The Lord Jesus speaking.
[1:02:12] So that's probably my favorite one. Any
[1:02:14] more questions, Liam?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; My name is Matthew
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; and my book is long, so I speak long.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Any more questions, Liam?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; I mean Liam, I mean Asher.
[1:02:32] One more question about any more
[1:02:33] questions about Matthew
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; 28.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I think it is
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; either Matthew or Luke. I think I think
[1:02:47] Luke might have edged me out a little
[1:02:49] bit because he he did a lot of research.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Who was my friend? Well, I had a I had a
[1:03:00] bunch of friends.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me let me let me finish with
[1:03:04] with this question about who was my
[1:03:06] friend.
[1:03:08] Um,
[1:03:11] I didn't have many friends.
[1:03:14] And this is this is going to be the last
[1:03:17] question that I answer. I didn't have
[1:03:20] many friends
[1:03:22] because
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; because nobody liked me.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Nobody liked me. They didn't like me
[1:03:29] because I didn't live
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; a lot of friends.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; I didn't I didn't have a I didn't have a
[1:03:35] lot of friends until Jesus came.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; And now listen,
[1:03:40] nobody liked me.
[1:03:43] I grew up and I I started this work and
[1:03:45] being a tax collector and I made a lot
[1:03:48] of money, but
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; I cheated my friends
[1:03:55] out of their money.
[1:03:58] So, does anybody know what taxes are?
[1:03:59] Your parents do.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; So, what I would do is is Rome
[1:04:09] who who required the taxes, I would say,
[1:04:13] let's say, brother brother Joseph and
[1:04:15] sister Zyra, I would say that you owe
[1:04:21] $2,000.
[1:04:23] Well, Rome would tell me, I would look
[1:04:25] at my book and Rome would tell me that
[1:04:28] Zyra and Joseph owe $2,000 in taxes.
[1:04:33] Okay?
[1:04:34] So, then I would go to them and I would
[1:04:38] say that will be $3,000.
[1:04:41] And then they would look at the book and
[1:04:43] they'd say, "Well, I just owe $2,000."
[1:04:45] And I'd say, "Yeah, I know. That'll be
[1:04:47] $3,000. and if you don't give me my
[1:04:50] $3,000, I'm going to take your donkey
[1:04:53] and I'm going to take your land and I'm
[1:04:55] going to take whatever it takes to get
[1:04:57] my extra thousand dollar. So, what I was
[1:05:00] doing is I was cheating my own people.
[1:05:03] And people hated me because I cheated
[1:05:06] them. But then when I met Jesus,
[1:05:11] I I stopped
[1:05:14] cheating because then I saw that I was
[1:05:16] doing wrong.
[1:05:17] And when you meet Jesus
[1:05:21] and you're doing wrong,
[1:05:23] something in your life wants to change.
[1:05:26] Are you with me?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Something in your life wants to change
[1:05:30] when you meet Jesus. Then you know
[1:05:32] you're doing wrong. And when I met him,
[1:05:34] I knew I was doing wrong.
[1:05:37] So that's why I didn't have any friends.
[1:05:39] But then
[1:05:41] when I met Jesus and I changed, then I
[1:05:43] had a lot of friends.
[1:05:46] Good.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.
[1:05:58] But because he died, we can live
[1:06:01] forever. Okay. Go back to your seats.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Did anybody not get candy
[1:06:08] a piece?
[1:06:16] Get out of here. You guys cheating like
[1:06:17] tax collectors.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Any any questions from the parents about
[1:06:26] the book of Matthew?
[1:06:30] You see, when Matthew was there, you can
[1:06:32] imagine when Jesus walked by and here's
[1:06:35] here's this guy Matthew. There's another
[1:06:37] tax collector named Zakius that had a
[1:06:40] similar testimony as Matthew. Everybody
[1:06:42] hated his guts.
[1:06:44] He was a cheater. He was a liar. He was
[1:06:47] an absolute creep. And then Jesus walks
[1:06:50] by and Matthew says, "You know what? I'm
[1:06:52] going to leave all of my riches. I'm
[1:06:54] going to leave everything. I'm going to
[1:06:56] become a poor man and I am going to
[1:06:59] follow Jesus." And you know what it
[1:07:01] resulted in? All of the disciples except
[1:07:04] one.
[1:07:06] It it resulted in their death.
[1:07:09] And I, Matthew, knew I was going to my
[1:07:11] death. In fact, I remember when Jesus
[1:07:13] was going down on the mountain, he said
[1:07:16] that you're going to suffer
[1:07:19] from knowing me. You're going to suffer
[1:07:20] for being my friend, but you're blessed
[1:07:22] if you do suffer.
[1:07:25] And we do and Christians. And now 2,000
[1:07:28] years later,
[1:07:30] you can see that you will suffer for
[1:07:32] being a true Christian, for standing up
[1:07:34] for Jesus. You will suffer as Matthew
[1:07:37] suffered, as Paul suffered, as John the
[1:07:40] Revelator suffered on the aisle of
[1:07:41] Patmas. We will all suffer. But it is
[1:07:44] better to suffer now
[1:07:47] than to suffer over on the other side.
[1:07:50] You with me? Any any questions? Any more
[1:07:53] questions from Matthew?
[1:07:56] Do you like children's church?
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; I do too.
[1:08:01] [applause]
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to get some of the
[1:08:05] older ones involved next time and we'll
[1:08:06] see. This is this is the birth of Christ
[1:08:08] that we're celebrating now. Maybe next
[1:08:11] time we'll uh we'll be on a series and
[1:08:14] uh we'll move in that direction. But,
[1:08:16] uh, we'll always have a theme and we're
[1:08:18] always going to have a preacher and I
[1:08:20] want to get some of the older ones
[1:08:21] involved and start ministering and start
[1:08:23] talking about the Lord and start
[1:08:25] witnessing. And this is this builds. I
[1:08:26] wish I had this Paul when I was little
[1:08:28] that I could I had the confidence to
[1:08:31] witness to other people. If you can
[1:08:32] stand in front of 50, 60, 70 people,
[1:08:36] however many people we have, if you can
[1:08:37] stand in front of them as a young man
[1:08:39] and minister, then you can certainly
[1:08:42] witness to your friends. Amen. Brother
[1:08:45] Jordan, thanks.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] [snorts]
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; The last word in Matthew was it amen?
[1:08:58] Is that correct? Let's sing that song.
[1:09:00] Amen. Amen. And I don't know, Sister
[1:09:03] Abby, if you have the words to the
[1:09:05] version I'm going to do here. So, we'll
[1:09:07] try it. You guys don't actually have to
[1:09:09] sing that part, but you guys can do the
[1:09:12] echo part.
[1:09:15] When we get to the verses, brother
[1:09:16] Daniel, you can help me and all the
[1:09:18] adults. I'll say something like, "See
[1:09:20] the baby." And you all say, "Amen." Yep.

[1:09:25] chorus first. Amen. Amen.

[1:11:07] sing as a congregation. They said it was
[1:11:08] a happy song. So, we're going to sing
[1:11:11] We're Going to a Mansion on the Happy
[1:11:13] Day Express. Then we'll sing maybe a
[1:11:17] might become a theme song for Children's
[1:11:19] Church and we'll dismiss. Amen. We're
