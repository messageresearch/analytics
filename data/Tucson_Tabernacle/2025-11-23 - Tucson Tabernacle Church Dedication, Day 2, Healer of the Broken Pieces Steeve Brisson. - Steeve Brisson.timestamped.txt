[15:00] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father which are in heaven.
[15:04] Lord, you're our great father. Lord, I
[15:07] think of myself being a father. Lord,
[15:11] I'd give my children anything they need,
[15:13] especially salvation and healing. Lord,
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're our great father. You're
[15:20] not just a father, Lord. You're our
[15:22] father. You're my father.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; You're every Christian's father, Lord.
[15:27] And you have the resources of heaven and
[15:29] earth, Lord, in the palm of your hand.
[15:32] And you can control it all, Lord. And
[15:34] you can just [music] give us our needs,
[15:36] Lord.
[15:37] Needs maybe we don't even know we have,
[15:39] Lord. Maybe a refilling of your Holy
[15:42] Spirit that we need, Lord. Maybe a
[15:43] topping off, Lord.
[15:45] Maybe something that's bothering us,
[15:47] Lord. I was hearing something recently,
[15:49] Lord, where sometimes we don't realize
[15:52] what we know we have need of, Lord. But
[15:54] you know, Lord,
[15:57] and you can just come in, Lord, and take
[15:59] control, whether it's a spirit or it's a
[16:01] natural cause, Lord.
[16:05] Lord, each need that's been [music]
[16:07] represented by an uplifted hand, Lord,
[16:09] this evening, unspoken, Lord, you know
[16:12] each one, Lord. Lord, forgive us of our
[16:15] sins, [music] our iniquities. Lord,
[16:17] where we failed and fallen short. Lord,
[16:20] forgive us for our doubts. Lord, our
[16:22] lack of faith. Lord, increase our faith.
[16:24] Lord, increase our love for one another,
[16:27] our humility, Lord.
[16:29] Lord, just help us, Lord, in these
[16:31] services. May all things be done
[16:33] pleasing and acceptable to you, Lord.
[16:38] Lord, be with Brother Steve as he
[16:40] prepares the minister. Lord
[16:43] be with the musicians, the singers.
[16:46] Lord,
[16:47] brother Josiah, Lord, as he leads us in
[16:50] song, Lord, just may everything be done
[16:53] pleasing and acceptable to you, Lord.
[16:55] Lord Jesus, we thank you for all these
[16:58] things. We thank you for your blessings
[16:59] in our lives. We thank you for Christian
[17:01] believers that we can unite with
[17:05] in faith, Lord, in unity. Lord,
[17:08] just be with us this evening. We ask
[17:10] these things in your precious lovely
[17:12] name, [music] our Lord Jesus Christ.

[17:20] sisters and William if you want to come
[17:22] up and get ready to sing
[17:26] right now.
[17:29] I don't know if you were all here last
[17:30] night, whoever was and wasn't. Let's
[17:33] just say, are you ready to have church
[17:35] tonight?
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to have church tonight?
[17:40] Amen. This is going to be good. We're so
[17:43] grateful to have brother Steve and his
[17:45] family here.
[17:46] Um, let's just welcome them.
[18:28] There will be mountains
[18:32] that I will have to climb.
[18:36] And there will be battles
[18:40] that I will have to fight.
[18:44] Victory or defeat.
[18:48] It's up to me [singing] to decide.
[18:52] How can I [music]
[18:54] expect to win?
[18:57] If I never try,
[19:01] I just
[19:04] &gt;&gt; I [singing and music]
[19:05] just can't give up now.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've come too far.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Too far [singing] from where I started
[19:16] from. [music]
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, nobody told me. God told me
[19:21] [singing]
[19:22] the road would be
[19:29] brought [singing and music] me this far
[19:30] to leave me.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Never said there wouldn't be trials.
[19:38] Never [music] said I wouldn't [singing]
[19:40] fall.
[19:42] Never said that everything would go the
[19:47] way I wanted to go.
[19:50] Oh, but when my back is against the wall
[19:54] and I feel all hope is gone,
[19:58] I just lift my head up to the sky. Say,
[20:03] "Help me to be strong."
[20:07] I just can't.
[20:10] I [singing]
[20:11] just [music] can't give up now.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; No, I've come too far.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Too far from where [singing] I started
[20:22] from.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Nobody told me.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Nobody told me the wrong would be.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; And I don't
[20:32] &gt;&gt; And I [singing] don't [music] believe he
[20:35] brought me this far to lead me.
[20:40] Oh, I know you didn't bring me out here
[20:45] to leave me lonely.
[20:48] And when I can't see clearly,
[20:52] I know that you are with me and I can't
[20:59] just [music and singing]
[21:00] give up.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've come too far. I'm [singing] too
[21:06] far from [music] where I started from.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Nobody told me
[21:15] &gt;&gt; this old road
[21:17] [singing] would be
[21:21] [music]
[21:22] brought me [singing] this far to leave
[21:25] me.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe. No, I don't.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; I don't believe [music and singing]
[21:30] he's brought me this far to leave me.
[21:33] And he didn't bring you this far. He
[21:36] didn't bring
[21:36] &gt;&gt; I don't believe he's [music and singing]
[21:38] brought me this far to leave me.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just can't believe he brought me
[21:43] this far.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; I don't believe he's brought me
[21:46] [singing and music] this far to leave
[21:48] me.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; If you're in a storm, he didn't bring
[21:51] you this far.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; I don't believe he's [music] brought me
[21:54] [singing] this far to leave me.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; One more time. He didn't bring you this
[21:59] far. I don't [singing] believe he's
[22:02] brought [music] me this far to leave me.
[22:08] [applause]
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.

[25:55] friend of mine. I've seen the Lord work
[25:57] in his life amazingly. And your
[26:00] testimony is one of the most spiritual
[26:02] and powerful testimonies I really have
[26:04] ever heard. And we're just going to get
[26:06] a little piece of it tonight. And I I
[26:09] got to tell you, this is just like the
[26:11] cherry that's on top. And there's a
[26:13] whole Sunday underneath it that Brother
[26:15] Manny could give. So, brother Manny,
[26:18] come on up. This is Brother Emanuel
[26:20] Cosio. And uh yeah, let's let's go to
[26:22] this one right here.
[26:25] And again, last night we had these
[26:27] testimonies. And I talked to the
[26:29] congregation. Sometimes we can't put our
[26:32] scriptures together just right. If
[26:34] somebody asks you, "Well, what church do
[26:35] you go to?" Or if you ask them if
[26:37] they're a Christian, and you just get
[26:38] maybe to that next sentence, and you
[26:41] think, "Oh, I just don't know what to
[26:43] say. Hey, I I can't I can't put the
[26:45] scriptures together and I can't quote
[26:47] the right ones. Listen, don't ever worry
[26:49] about that. You just tell them how you
[26:51] got your candle lit and that is what's
[26:54] going to mean the most to everyone. It's
[26:56] you can tie in the scriptures and that's
[26:58] good. But do you think Mary Magdalene
[27:00] was opening up her Old Testament and
[27:02] explaining to everyone how that this man
[27:05] that that came Jesus was the Christ? No.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; No. She was telling, "I saw that man
[27:13] when he came out of the tomb after he
[27:15] was dead for three days.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; I saw that man raise the dead. I saw
[27:20] that man heal the sick. I was It was me
[27:24] that seven devils were cast out of.
[27:27] That's what meant the most probably
[27:29] those people that Mary Magdalene was
[27:30] testifying to." Brother Manny, God bless
[27:32] you, my friend.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody, it's good to be in the house
[27:35] of the Lord.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'm going to start off. Um,
[27:40] I grew up a Catholic. I was never a a
[27:43] church goer, you know. Uh, I didn't like
[27:45] to go inside the church to see Jesus on
[27:47] the cross. I would start crying and they
[27:49] would tell me, "You have a demon in
[27:50] you." I said, "No, it just don't feel
[27:51] right." I felt out of place. So, I
[27:54] stopped going. So, I would just hang
[27:55] around with my cousins in the
[27:56] neighborhood. I come from one of the
[27:59] oldest neighborhoods in Tucson. My
[28:01] family been there since it was Mexico
[28:03] because Arizona didn't become a state
[28:05] till 1912.
[28:07] So I I grew up in a prideful
[28:10] neighborhood. We were all proud being
[28:12] where we were from. And growing up in
[28:14] the 80s in that neighborhood was was
[28:16] rough. Like the streets would tell
[28:19] stories. You would see the this the the
[28:23] murder scene with the yellow tape, the
[28:25] chalk lines. You know, it was rough
[28:27] growing up in the 80s in my
[28:28] neighborhood. You know, you had to
[28:32] be real or you're not going to make it.
[28:34] So it was really rough.
[28:37] You know, it was different times,
[28:38] different era. My dad,
[28:41] he was like one of the most feared mans
[28:43] in my neighborhood. You know, uh he was
[28:45] very mean, abusive, drug user. My mom
[28:49] was alcoholic. Uh my dad was a drug
[28:52] dealer. You know, that's what he taught
[28:54] us. Uh if you didn't have his money, he
[28:56] would you know what happens, you know.
[28:58] And then I remember it was like I was
[29:02] like seven or eight years old. It was
[29:04] summertime. I went to my grandma's and
[29:06] he was there with his friends and he
[29:09] forced me to smoke a joint and I didn't
[29:11] want to but if I didn't do it he would
[29:12] hit me and I remember his friend telling
[29:14] him man don't get your son eye and he
[29:17] said shut your mouth not in those words
[29:19] but you know he said you don't tell me
[29:22] what to do so then I didn't want to hit
[29:24] him he said don't be a so I just
[29:27] want I I just want to make my dad proud
[29:28] cuz I didn't want to get hit
[29:31] so you know it just went on and then uh
[29:34] around 15, I just got tired of being his
[29:37] punching bag and I left to the streets
[29:39] and I went to the neighborhood where I'm
[29:42] from and became a
[29:45] a gangster, I guess, whatever you want
[29:46] to call it, a gang member. And I was
[29:49] like 15 and and I I was out in the
[29:51] streets and my my friend told me, "Let's
[29:53] go to Aunt Mary's." I go, I really don't
[29:54] want to go there because she was a drug
[29:57] dealer, but it was a safe haven. Like,
[29:59] it's better than getting my butt whoop.
[30:01] So, I went there. I stayed there and
[30:03] before I knew it, I became what I hated
[30:06] the most, a drug dealer. At 15,
[30:10] stopped going to school cuz I thought
[30:12] school wasn't wasn't for me. You know, I
[30:14] was making that fast money and it would
[30:17] just it wasn't right. You know, I was
[30:19] just waiting for my mom or my dad to
[30:20] come get me, but they never did. So, I
[30:23] just ended up just becoming ruthless,
[30:26] heartless, and became I started walking
[30:29] in darkness. You know, when you walk in
[30:31] darkness, you do wickedness.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; And my uncle did 25 years and he came
[30:37] out and tried to tell me about Jesus.
[30:39] And I said, "Where was Jesus when your
[30:41] dad when my dad was beating me up, you
[30:44] know what I mean?" And I said, "Where
[30:45] was God at?" I go, "I don't got time for
[30:47] that." But they're like, "It pricked
[30:49] me." And I I still get the goosebumps.
[30:52] And he's
[30:54] kept on talking about him and I'm like,
[30:56] "Yeah, whatever, dude." You know, and
[30:58] then then like one day he just said,
[31:01] "You got to read it." So I started
[31:02] reading Matthew. He said, "Just just
[31:04] read Matthew." And I started reading
[31:05] Matthew and it got me.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; It got me. And I like I was like,
[31:10] "Whoa." And then then I started drifting
[31:14] away from the world, but
[31:18] still, you know, you still have your
[31:19] cousins, you spirits me. And then I go
[31:21] back to the world,
[31:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:23] &gt;&gt; And I stayed there for a long long long
[31:26] time.
[31:27] doing the work of the devil, destroying
[31:29] lies, marriages, you know, selling
[31:32] selling poison. Like I was like that
[31:34] poor man that oppresses the poor and
[31:36] leaves no food. I didn't know what kind
[31:38] of man I was till I went to prison. You
[31:41] know, I was so selfish that I was taking
[31:44] money from people. Didn't realize that
[31:47] they had bills. Didn't realize they had
[31:48] children.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; I just wanted me is all about me. I was
[31:52] selfish, greedy. My heart was like like
[31:55] titanium.
[31:57] If you have something I want, you didn't
[31:58] want to give it, you're going to give it
[32:00] either way. You're going to break it.
[32:02] You know what I mean? So, uh, like in
[32:05] 2009, uh, my my my wife, my first wife
[32:07] got cancer and, uh, she died of it and
[32:11] it changed it. It really did a number to
[32:14] me. Uh, I was on probation and and and I
[32:17] I was trying to get help. They they sent
[32:20] me to cope, my uh my probation officer.
[32:22] She sent me to cope and uh she goes, "I
[32:25] I want you to meet Danzelle Buchanan."
[32:28] And I was already being a big guy. I go,
[32:29] "Damn, he's a black dude." I like,
[32:31] "Dang." And he goes, "He's from the
[32:33] south side of Chicago. He's up your
[32:35] alley." I like, "Oh, wow. He's going to
[32:37] be a mean guy." And when cuz I'm already
[32:40] reading my Bible, so I'm still reading
[32:41] my Bible. When I see him walk in, I look
[32:44] at him, he has this this white glow
[32:46] around him. And he says, "Who you mad
[32:48] dogging?" I said, "I'm not mad dogging
[32:50] you." I go, "You got the Holy Spirit on
[32:51] you." He goes, "Who you talking to?" I
[32:53] said, "He's telling me." Then he goes,
[32:55] "You know what? I'm going to to school
[32:57] to become a pastor."
[32:59] &gt;&gt; And when we became best friends and and
[33:01] and he baptized me, and then then uh
[33:05] there's that whisper again, got into
[33:08] that whisper, got caught, went to
[33:11] prison, went to prison, I came out,
[33:14] started started walking with God, and
[33:17] once again in that neighborhood,
[33:20] started back in darkness. and and I
[33:23] stayed there till about
[33:26] probably almost 3 years ago. Uh my son
[33:28] and I I was still selling weed and
[33:31] whatever, you know. I had a job, but I
[33:33] still doing doing it because that's more
[33:36] addicting than anything is the money.
[33:39] So, uh we were cruising around doing
[33:41] deliveries and
[33:43] on river and was it Stone and River at
[33:46] the old Sweet Tomatoes.
[33:49] This guy pulls on the side of me and I
[33:51] tell my son, "Look at this guy with the
[33:53] ski mask." I said, "Brace yourself." He
[33:56] said, "For what?" And he shot like four
[33:58] times. He hit me on the side of the
[34:01] head. My son lost his eye. And I think
[34:04] that was like just a sign for God like,
[34:07] "Dude, you went to prison for this. Why
[34:09] you being like the dog returning to his
[34:10] vomit?"
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Right? So sometimes God works in
[34:15] mysterious ways. It might take a little
[34:17] sting like that to Hey, I I got you. I
[34:20] thought I was going to die, but I did.
[34:22] You I was like, my son said, I don't
[34:23] want to die. I think I'm dying. Look at
[34:25] all the blood I'm dripping on. And and
[34:27] my son, I had he's he's a big boy. And I
[34:30] was rocking like he was a baby. I said,
[34:32] "You're not going to die." And I was
[34:33] crying like, "You're not going to die.
[34:34] You're not going to die." So, I'm going
[34:36] to die before you. And then, thank God
[34:38] just it was just birdshot. And thank God
[34:41] it was birdshot. It was a saw off
[34:44] shotgun because if it was a a fuller
[34:46] barrel, I probably wouldn't be here. And
[34:48] I tell everybody, you got to you can't
[34:50] tell me God wasn't with me.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; And that's when everything changed for
[34:54] me. I stopped, put everything away. I
[34:57] told God,
[34:59] separate everything that ain't of you
[35:01] from me. And that was everybody, my
[35:04] cousins, my friends. And I was alone.
[35:07] And I was like, what's happening? Then I
[35:10] remember what you asked for.
[35:12] So,
[35:15] so uh about uh about two years ago, I I
[35:18] met I met this I met this girl
[35:21] uh Grace Sella. Her family came here
[35:23] since for the long time. And uh I asked
[35:27] for God. I asked God, I need a God. I
[35:29] need a woman of God. And I don't care
[35:31] how she comes broken. Care what color
[35:33] she is. Long as she has the same belief
[35:35] I have. And he sent grace. am. That was
[35:39] like one of the best things that ever
[35:40] happened to me that he sent me. My my
[35:42] woman of God, my virtuous wife, she's
[35:45] prudent. She's she's strong in the Lord
[35:48] and she's making me strong. My
[35:49] mother-in-law,
[35:51] she she's has a big influence on me
[35:54] coming to church cuz like I said, I
[35:57] wasn't really a church cohort. And she
[35:59] invited me one day. We were going to
[36:00] Brother's Bakers. That's way out there.
[36:03] and my my mother would work like a 12 or
[36:05] 13 hour shift on Saturday. Don't sleep,
[36:08] go home, shower, and go to church.
[36:10] That's that's a soldier.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; That's a soldier for for for the God for
[36:14] you know what I mean? And so, you know,
[36:16] I just started hanging around and
[36:19] my my heart started chipping that that
[36:21] that titanium.
[36:24] So, it started chipping away. And
[36:28] when uh I got baptized,
[36:31] I went in the water and when I came out
[36:33] cuz I cast all my cares and worries on
[36:35] him and and when I got off of when I
[36:38] came off of that water, I felt all those
[36:40] chains just released
[36:44] &gt;&gt; and and I still feel them. I feel this
[36:46] rush and I don't know how to explain it,
[36:49] but I my cousin said, "You're crazy." I
[36:51] said, "Well, if Jesus is crazy, I'm
[36:54] crazy. I'm crazy for him.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; But that's my testimony I want to share.
[36:58] If Jesus could change a wicked, wretched
[37:01] man like me, he could change anybody.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; You got to keep your faith in him
[37:06] &gt;&gt; and your hope in Jesus because he's the
[37:08] truth, the way, and the life.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; No one comes to the father except
[37:11] through him. Remember. Amen. Thank you.
[37:14] [applause]
[37:19] [applause]
[37:24] Brother Manny walked up there when I was
[37:26] baptizing
[37:27] and didn't expect him to come up. He
[37:29] didn't ask before service or anything.
[37:31] He just he just came up there and uh
[37:34] baptized him.
[37:36] And then a week later, he got my phone
[37:39] number and he texted me and he gave the
[37:42] testimony. He said, "I've done drugs
[37:45] about every day of my life since I've
[37:46] been seven years old." And he said,
[37:49] "When I came up out of the water," he
[37:52] said, "That was the last time I've done
[37:54] drugs." And he said, "It's been seven
[37:56] days now. I wanted to wait till a week
[37:57] was over before I told you." And now
[38:00] that's been over a year.
[38:04] [applause]
[38:12] We have a special blessing tonight. Our
[38:15] brother Steve Brasson is he's
[38:17] tremendous, [snorts] wonderful preacher,
[38:19] very very deep in the scriptures. And uh
[38:23] he's you saw his family here. His family
[38:25] is a testimony to him sitting here in
[38:27] the front row. And you know the Bible
[38:30] teaches us that a pastor is to be judged
[38:35] in part by their family. that their
[38:37] family must be in order and subjection
[38:39] and and respect of their dad. Brother
[38:42] Steve certainly checks all the boxes,
[38:44] but we can see that that's a very very
[38:46] good box that he checks. He's become a
[38:50] good friend of mine over the past few
[38:51] months and I am really excited. He he
[38:54] did a tremendous job last night and I'm
[38:57] really looking forward to what he has
[39:00] for us here this evening. So, let's all
[39:02] stand. Josiah, if you could
[39:05] help me, please.

[39:32] I was lost
[39:34] and undone
[39:37] without God [singing] or his son.
[39:43] when he reached
[39:46] down his hand
[39:49] for me.
[39:51] Would you raise your hands to the Lord
[39:53] and sing that again as brother Steve
[39:54] comes? When he reached
[39:58] down his hand
[40:02] for [singing] me.

[40:10] down his hand
[40:13] for me. [singing]

[40:56] out his hand
[40:58] for me.

[41:13] for his son. [music and singing]
[41:15] when he reached
[41:18] down his hand
[41:21] for [singing] me.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; How many felt the hand of the Lord upon
[41:28] their life?
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're all witness.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; We all witness tonight of the precious
[41:35] grace of the Lord.

[44:57] um, last night and tonight, I feel it's
[45:00] appropriate to have this kind of title.
[45:02] But also something that really the Lord
[45:05] touched me. I'm I'm coming back from
[45:07] Congo. We preached several service over
[45:10] there and on the plane from moving
[45:13] around in the country over there,
[45:14] something really struck me and I want to
[45:16] share that with you tonight.
[45:19] And so
[45:21] just to give you a little bit of
[45:22] background about my life, I was I was uh
[45:26] my mom gave her life to the Lord in
[45:28] 1979. So I was two years old. So, I was
[45:31] raised I was raised in the church and
[45:33] and um when I was seven years old, my
[45:37] father left uh left our our life and so
[45:40] I'm Greek. So, he moved back he did move
[45:43] back to Greece. And the night that he
[45:45] announced his departure that he would he
[45:47] would leave us, my mom said I cried all
[45:50] night and she was kind of desperate
[45:52] because she was a bit afraid that I
[45:54] would come like never get over it. It
[45:56] was I was so devastated.
[46:00] I don't remember that. But she said the
[46:02] next day I got up and went to school and
[46:05] seems like I'd forgot about it and I was
[46:07] fine. You know, sometimes is as as kids
[46:10] we we underestimate the impact when
[46:13] something bad happened to them because
[46:15] seems like a couple of days after
[46:16] they're like, well, he's just fine. But
[46:18] they're they're not fine. It's just that
[46:20] there's a co coping mechanism that
[46:23] they'll they'll move on, but it's it
[46:25] stays inside of them. And after that I
[46:27] became uh an anxious an anxious child
[46:32] with a anxiety uh disorder what I fought
[46:36] I fought all my life with that. It's
[46:38] until uh uh later in my life I realized
[46:41] that I was I was affected by that. And I
[46:46] I always thought my mom, you know, she
[46:48] was a Christian, so she prayed, Lord, I
[46:49] I pray that that my son would never be
[46:52] affected by the fact that this dad left
[46:55] and and and so I heard my mom said that.
[46:57] And I always thought that, you know, it
[46:59] was not a big deal. You know, I was
[47:01] raised with my mother and and and
[47:04] you don't know what you're missing if
[47:05] it's not there. It's kind of an
[47:07] invisible pain which is is is it's kind
[47:10] of a tricky because if I've heard the
[47:11] the testimony of a brother here tonight
[47:14] and and he had he had a father that was
[47:16] present and he he he did hurt him. So
[47:18] you can't identify the pain the bruise
[47:21] you can't identify but something that's
[47:24] a bit tricky is that when when when
[47:26] father leaves to be raised in a home
[47:29] with a f father fatherless home is a bit
[47:31] tricky because it's an invisible womb.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's it's a pain caused by
[47:38] something that you've lacked, but you
[47:39] don't know what you've because you don't
[47:41] know what you don't know, but it follows
[47:43] you. And so I was raised I was raised in
[47:46] church and and it was not a positive
[47:50] experience especially for my mother. Uh
[47:52] she struggled for many many years, 15
[47:54] years in church wondering if her sins
[47:56] were forgiven and she would go see the
[47:58] pastor, do I have the Holy Spirit? And
[47:59] the pastor's yes, you have it. And and
[48:01] there was a lot of spiritual struggle.
[48:03] And so my my mom, you know, being in
[48:06] church and being supposedly being you're
[48:09] in church and you're supposed to be
[48:10] close to the Lord, but she was always
[48:12] affected by this this uh h um lack of
[48:17] spiritual security, feeling that I'm
[48:19] being accepted by God. My sins are being
[48:21] forgiven. And so there's always been a a
[48:24] a level of a certain sadness around our
[48:26] home because something was was
[48:28] spiritually something was lacking. And
[48:31] so I was raised just with my mom and my
[48:33] mom was working obviously she had to
[48:35] make a living and so she uh she was
[48:38] working. So I was I found myself most of
[48:40] the time I was just by myself and so I
[48:42] can I can spell loneliness and you know
[48:45] just wandering in the streets and trying
[48:48] to find some friends and and and I I for
[48:51] me when I remember my childhood I I I I
[48:53] just see the streets and me riding my
[48:55] bicycle going nowhere
[48:57] and and it's it's it's it's a it's a
[49:00] feeling that stays with you and and so I
[49:03] I grew up like that and you know in
[49:06] church and in church and you struggle
[49:08] because you you're in church and they
[49:11] you know that he's a holy God and and
[49:13] this is holy word and there's a call for
[49:15] a holy life but you don't have no
[49:18] victory. So, you're sitting in church
[49:19] and you feel like a hypocrite because
[49:21] because you don't have victory in your
[49:23] life and you know you're you're you're
[49:25] overwhelmed and overcome by sin. And I
[49:28] remember playing guitar in church and it
[49:30] was communion service, brother.
[49:32] Communion service was that when they
[49:34] would announce communion service, I was
[49:35] so afraid. I was like, "Oh Lord,
[49:37] judgment day." And and and and so I
[49:41] remember sitting and being sitting in
[49:42] front, me and my cousin, we're pretty
[49:44] much in the same rut. like we wouldn't
[49:45] have no victory in our life and playing
[49:47] music in church and remember everybody
[49:50] moves forward taking communion and we're
[49:52] sitting there you know like pity and not
[49:55] moving not feeling wordy and and that
[49:57] night would be Lord you know I will do
[49:59] my best and and it's the last time I do
[50:01] this and I'm I'm going to be I'm going
[50:03] to be a better Christian just to find
[50:05] yourself a week later going back to the
[50:07] same thing and living a defeated life in
[50:10] church is is is horrible. It's not like
[50:13] you're you're out there in a bar and
[50:15] like, okay, you can take a stand and
[50:17] give your life to the Lord and go to
[50:18] church. You're in you're in church and
[50:21] so you're supposed to be close to the
[50:23] thing, but you're so far.
[50:26] And so I my mom got spiritually got
[50:30] discouraged when I was 16. She backslid
[50:32] and she left and she even left the home
[50:35] and she went on to live with a man. And
[50:37] just to just before I forget now she
[50:40] when when God called me to the ministry
[50:42] she never missed one service and she was
[50:43] still in the world then because I came
[50:45] back before her and just be before I
[50:48] forgot because sometime I tell the bad
[50:49] part of my mother's testimony and I
[50:52] don't give the good part because I
[50:53] forget and so since I started
[50:56] ministering many years ago she never
[50:58] missed a service. She always wanted to
[51:00] hear a son preaching and she ended up
[51:02] giving her life back to the Lord and
[51:04] she's in our church right now and so
[51:05] she's serving the Lord. And what is
[51:07] amazing [applause]
[51:10] she what is amazing is when she came
[51:12] back she came back on a solid foundation
[51:15] and having a revelation of the grace of
[51:17] God the cross and and and how you know
[51:20] her sins were forgiven and she she never
[51:22] looked back and that the sin question
[51:24] was settled for her and which is which
[51:26] is a good news because it's horrible to
[51:28] spend 15 years in a church wondering if
[51:30] God has accepted you and has my sins
[51:33] been forgiven or there's God is holding
[51:35] this against me and So going back uh uh
[51:39] uh to so at 16 she she backslid and she
[51:42] she left and she even left home and so
[51:44] at 16 I end I ended up living by myself
[51:46] in the house and I never realized that
[51:49] what's you know when you're young you
[51:50] just go with the flow you don't think
[51:53] you just you know it's it's you go by
[51:55] instinct so you just go with it it's
[51:57] just until my son got 16 and I looked at
[52:00] my son he was 16 and like really
[52:03] &gt;&gt; right
[52:04] &gt;&gt; is that age I found myself alone in the
[52:06] house like oh my goodness that was that
[52:09] was not good like I don't imagine doing
[52:11] that to my son you know but my mom out
[52:13] of despair and with the sadness and all
[52:16] that she she was trying to find
[52:18] happiness somewhere and so I when she
[52:21] left I'm like no I'm going to stay you
[52:22] know I'm going to stay and and and I'm
[52:25] going to serve God I'm not in I'm not
[52:27] serving God I'm not in church because of
[52:29] my mother I'm there because I I made a
[52:31] decision because I I got baptized at 8
[52:33] years old I forgot to say that and I
[52:35] remember I was playing in in the house
[52:37] and and something came down on me and
[52:40] and and I I I and I got up and I went to
[52:42] see my mother and I says I want to be a
[52:44] Christian and that was sincere really
[52:45] the presence of God came on me and it
[52:47] was like one of my first experience with
[52:49] God but then after that I started
[52:52] struggling with many things you know
[52:54] holiness and you know sexual temptation
[52:56] and all that you know and you fall and
[52:59] you get up back up and you fall again
[53:01] and that you get discouraged of living a
[53:04] defeated life. And so at 17, I ended up
[53:07] backsliding and going in the world for
[53:08] four years and and I went and everything
[53:11] I I I could. And I I remember though
[53:13] when I left uh I I was raised uh our our
[53:17] church was in Montreal and it was
[53:18] downtown and so it was a rough part of
[53:20] Montreal and and so I've seen drug
[53:24] addict before and I've heard many
[53:26] testimony of drug addiction. And so when
[53:28] I when I when I left church and I went
[53:30] in the world, I remember I told myself
[53:33] there's I I've I've put only one limit.
[53:35] I'll I'll never do drugs because I knew
[53:38] that there is nothing there because I've
[53:40] seen so many people coming out of it and
[53:42] with their testimony uh like we heard
[53:44] tonight when you hear that as a kid it's
[53:47] you get you get it that okay there's
[53:49] nothing there. And so I went in the
[53:52] world and you know you know the bars and
[53:54] sports and I did a lot of things and and
[53:56] the girls and everything but but you're
[53:59] you're seeking for pleasure you know
[54:00] you're you're going for pleasure and and
[54:03] and at one point you know you it's it's
[54:05] the bars and then the bars close up and
[54:07] that during that time they started to do
[54:10] some raves. So raves was that that where
[54:13] you go places you have to take ecstasy.
[54:15] So, uh, after the bar closed, then you
[54:17] go and then after the rave was not
[54:19] enough. They invented the after rave.
[54:21] So, that the the sun would get up and
[54:23] then you go on the beach and then
[54:25] there's that music and all that. But you
[54:27] So, you go full around the clock, but I
[54:29] had a problem. I was not doing drugs and
[54:31] I was surrounded by people on ecstasy,
[54:33] you know, and and they can go around the
[54:35] clock because they're they on speed, but
[54:37] you're not. And so, at one point, I had
[54:39] to make a decision. If I want to follow
[54:41] that kind of pace, I need to do drugs.
[54:43] And that's where I realized that I was
[54:45] not going anywhere. And during that
[54:47] period of time, you know, with that
[54:48] lifestyle, I was I was working on in a
[54:51] printing uh business and I was doing
[54:53] like $825 an hour, but my lifestyle was
[54:56] more much more expensive than that. So,
[54:58] I had a problem with money. Uh I was
[55:00] short on money but my friend was always
[55:03] coming and he he had this you know you
[55:05] know he was paying you know all right
[55:06] guy you know it's on me and he would I
[55:08] was like and I knew like he was working
[55:10] in another shop and he was not doing
[55:12] much more money than you know he's like
[55:13] where do you take all that money bro
[55:15] like ah you know forget about it you
[55:17] know so he always had this big chunk of
[55:20] money and and he's like and I and I kept
[55:23] you know I kept bugging him I was like I
[55:25] want to know where do you get this money
[55:26] and he didn't want to and this this this
[55:29] this guy, we grew up in in church
[55:31] together
[55:33] and um he backslid before me and when I
[55:36] started to drifting, I started to hang
[55:38] out with him and he was he was all cool,
[55:39] all nice and he he he became a real
[55:42] friend, but a bad friend, but he was a
[55:44] real friend. He was all nice with me and
[55:46] he never wanted to influence me for me
[55:48] to leave church. He never said anything.
[55:50] He just what he did, he cared for me. He
[55:53] loved me and he was a good friend. And
[55:54] that's what I needed. I needed a good
[55:56] friend, somebody who cared for me. And
[55:58] and that's why sometime when you don't
[56:00] have the real love and the real
[56:02] attention, you'll go you'll you'll go
[56:04] get it somewhere else. And and and
[56:06] that's where you end up with having bad
[56:08] friends. A lot of people a lot of young
[56:10] people end up in gangs and street gangs
[56:12] and all that. And they they at first
[56:14] they don't do that to become evil or to
[56:16] do bad things. The first portion
[56:19] sometime is just that well it's it's my
[56:21] only family. They accepted me and they
[56:24] look for care. They look for acceptance
[56:26] and and and they get it there and then
[56:28] it comes with the rest. And so I ended
[56:31] up backsliding and and and and I I was
[56:34] bugging him. I wanted to know where you
[56:35] get all that money. I want that kind of
[56:37] money. Me too. And he finally told me
[56:39] that he was he was he was stealing money
[56:41] in stores.
[56:43] And the way he was doing is that in in
[56:45] the groceries these days, you know, the
[56:47] the manager would go from cash cashier
[56:49] to cashier. He grabbed all the money,
[56:51] put that in a tube, and then they would
[56:53] put that in a in a tube and and it would
[56:55] go up, you know, in in the office there.
[56:57] And so while they were going from casher
[56:59] to casher, we you you could grab the
[57:01] envelope at the end and then just run
[57:03] away with it. And so that's what he was
[57:05] doing. So I'm like, "Yeah, that seems
[57:07] like a good idea. I want to do that, you
[57:09] know, because I wanted the money to
[57:11] support my lifestyle."
[57:14] And so but we we we planned another coup
[57:18] that another old up that we wanted to
[57:20] do. It was a big store and during those
[57:22] days people were paying there was a lot
[57:24] of cash going on. and it was less
[57:25] plastic and credit card. And so we kind
[57:27] of planned this that when he was leaving
[57:30] the store at 9:00, he was he was driving
[57:32] his car and getting close to getting
[57:34] close to the bank and he was doing that
[57:35] night deposit, you know, just open put
[57:38] the money and and so my my friend had a
[57:40] a shotgun. And so we we kind of prepare
[57:43] that and we were we were supposed to rub
[57:45] him. And so one night, so every Thursday
[57:48] night, which was the big night, uh uh we
[57:50] we watch couple of Thursday night, we
[57:52] watch him doing his deposit. Okay. He
[57:54] was always on time. We were parked there
[57:56] in the parking lot just looking at him.
[57:58] Okay, he's is this he's on time and all
[58:00] that. And so one night, one Thursday
[58:02] night, we decided, okay, let's go. Let's
[58:04] let's go do this. And so I was the
[58:06] driver and um he had the shotgun.
[58:10] And so I had my own car, not the plates,
[58:14] not covered like it's a it's like just,
[58:16] you know, junior uh junior Bandido.
[58:20] And so
[58:24] the manager comes with his car, get out
[58:26] of his car. My friend is sitting just by
[58:27] the just on the sidewalk there and he's
[58:29] waiting for him to to get out of his car
[58:31] just to pull out his gun, grab the
[58:32] money. But the the manager get out of
[58:34] his car, pass by him, and my friend
[58:37] doesn't move. And he does a disobite. He
[58:40] leaves. He leaves. And then I was so
[58:42] mad. So I got in my car and I came to
[58:45] close to him. I started yelling, "What's
[58:46] your problem? What's your what?" He
[58:47] said, "I don't know. I froze, man. I
[58:49] don't know what's wrong with me. I just
[58:50] froze. I I I couldn't do it. And I was
[58:51] like, "Man," and I was so mad. I was mad
[58:54] after him, but I don't know I would have
[58:55] the courage to do it myself, but I was
[58:57] the driver, so I was doing my part. And
[59:00] so he says, "No, man. I'm sorry. Next
[59:02] week we're going to do it next week." So
[59:03] I says, "Well, you better like next week
[59:05] we're going to do this." And uh so
[59:08] finally the next week uh we're supposed
[59:10] to do that at 9:00. But he comes around
[59:12] and he says, "You know what? we going to
[59:14] do? We going to we going to uh uh do go
[59:17] to this grocery store and we going to
[59:20] go, you know, and so he wanted and that
[59:22] was like a $3,000 robbery, a small one.
[59:24] The other one with the big store was
[59:26] probably 50 50,000 maybe 100,000.
[59:29] There's a lot of money going on. And so
[59:32] he decided and so just like that, we
[59:34] decided to do this small little hold up
[59:37] and think like not much. And then we got
[59:39] caught on that one. So after when you
[59:43] become a Christian, you realize probably
[59:45] Angel of God was standing there for him
[59:47] to froze because God that's not what
[59:51] that was not my calling.
[59:53] So God wanted to make sure I got a short
[59:55] career in in in in crime in crime. And
[59:59] so I got caught for a small thing and I
[1:00:02] ended up in jail that night. And and
[1:00:04] that was one of the first, you know, one
[1:00:06] of her first blow where where God knocks
[1:00:09] at your door. I cried. I remember I had
[1:00:11] broken with my girlfriend the day
[1:00:13] before. And I was I was broken. I was
[1:00:16] crying. And I was just this little
[1:00:18] church little boy. Now I'm 18year-old.
[1:00:20] And I remember I did the old up with my
[1:00:22] church shoes.
[1:00:25] And I remember when they got me into
[1:00:27] jail, you know, they rip my shoes apart
[1:00:30] and you know, they treat you rough. And
[1:00:32] I remember the they always the detective
[1:00:35] comes, you know, and there's the good
[1:00:36] cup and the bad cup, the ones the rough
[1:00:38] guy and the and so he's they wake me up
[1:00:41] at 4:00 in the morning and and sat me
[1:00:43] there and and then the rough cup starts,
[1:00:46] you know, and they wanted to lick me
[1:00:47] link me with all the oldups that
[1:00:50] happened in the city. Like they they
[1:00:51] didn't believe I was I was a starter.
[1:00:53] [laughter]
[1:00:55] And so I said, "No, it's my first. It's
[1:00:58] my first." And then he bang on on the
[1:01:00] table and he he he he was trying to
[1:01:03] rough me up and it worked cuz I started
[1:01:04] crying. So when I started crying, he's
[1:01:06] like, "Okay, this is not a tough guy.
[1:01:08] This is like this is like a this is a
[1:01:10] softy." So
[1:01:13] he
[1:01:14] then the the good cop came and he says,
[1:01:16] "Okay, let's call the somebody you want
[1:01:18] to call." And I called my mom and but
[1:01:20] but something broke something broke
[1:01:22] there inside of me. And and and the next
[1:01:25] step was when I was doing raves and I
[1:01:28] then I realized the next step I needed
[1:01:30] to take drugs and I realized I saw the
[1:01:32] line that I draw myself and I'm like now
[1:01:36] do I do I step over this line or not?
[1:01:38] And that's where I realized and that's I
[1:01:41] was going nowhere and that God was
[1:01:44] calling me home because I knew I knew
[1:01:46] better.
[1:01:48] And I remember that night I I went by my
[1:01:52] bed
[1:01:54] and I was not crying. I was not
[1:01:56] emotional. There was this was a r
[1:01:58] rational decision. I just, you know,
[1:02:01] went on my knees just by my bed and I
[1:02:03] said, "Lord, I've been leading my own
[1:02:06] life for four years and I'm going
[1:02:08] nowhere. I'm going in circle." And I
[1:02:11] knew I was going nowhere.
[1:02:13] And just the fact that Lord, I'm going
[1:02:15] nowhere and I'm giving you my life. I I
[1:02:19] repented of my sins and I said, "Lord,
[1:02:21] I'm giving you the control of my life.
[1:02:24] Take the control back."
[1:02:26] And I started going back to church and
[1:02:31] I was really on fire for God.
[1:02:34] And then I got an experience with God.
[1:02:36] Holy Spirit came in my life and that's
[1:02:38] where I started to have a call for the
[1:02:39] ministry.
[1:02:40] In the same time that happened, the call
[1:02:42] for the ministry, God showed me that
[1:02:44] Esther was would be my wife. And it it's
[1:02:46] weird because I was struggling because
[1:02:49] all the youth, all the young people knew
[1:02:51] in in our church that Esther had a
[1:02:53] special call that she would marry a
[1:02:54] minister. So when God started dealing
[1:02:56] with me that I would should marry her, I
[1:02:58] was like, "No, Lord, like she's reserved
[1:03:00] for a minister. Like I'm I'm this is not
[1:03:03] a question. I will I cannot marry her."
[1:03:06] and and at the same time separately two
[1:03:09] separate box God was calling me to the
[1:03:11] ministry and I was struggling and I was
[1:03:13] fighting it and I was fighting it and I
[1:03:15] was so I was fighting both ideas
[1:03:17] separately
[1:03:18] and the day that
[1:03:21] God really clenched the nail is that he
[1:03:24] I remember I was working on the night
[1:03:25] shift at a printing shop and and God
[1:03:28] came down it's it was not an audible
[1:03:30] voice but it felt like one and God told
[1:03:32] me the minister that Esther is going to
[1:03:34] marry is you.
[1:03:36] And then it dawned on me like, "Wow, I
[1:03:39] never thought about that." And that that
[1:03:41] day it was settled. And so we moved on
[1:03:44] and and we got married and I was
[1:03:46] ministering during that time and we
[1:03:48] started to have children.
[1:03:50] And this is where the part of the min
[1:03:52] the the the
[1:03:54] meeting that my testimony that I want to
[1:03:56] convey to you. And so I had accepted the
[1:03:59] Lord as my savior. He has saved me from
[1:04:02] my sins. He saved me from a from the
[1:04:05] filth and perversion and all that. He
[1:04:07] cleansed me and and when I when he
[1:04:09] called me to the ministry, he became he
[1:04:11] became my lord. He became because
[1:04:13] there's a difference between savior and
[1:04:14] lord.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; You know, as savior, he saved you from
[1:04:18] something. He pulls you out of the
[1:04:19] water. But lord is after he pulled you
[1:04:23] out of the water, your reaction is is
[1:04:25] now Lord, I want to follow you. You're
[1:04:28] going to be my Lord. Which is a
[1:04:30] different thing. And and when that
[1:04:32] happened, you know, there's a difference
[1:04:34] between uh uh when he when he saves you
[1:04:37] and the difference when he becomes your
[1:04:40] Lord.
[1:04:43] There's, you know, in modern religion,
[1:04:45] modern Christianity today is, you know,
[1:04:47] Jesus says, you know, come as you are.
[1:04:50] And it's true. Come as you are. Jesus
[1:04:52] will accept you as you are. Come as you
[1:04:54] are. But the next step is Jesus message.
[1:04:59] Jesus message is not stay as you are.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; He has a life for you.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; He has a plan for you. Yeah. He save you
[1:05:05] as you are. But then if you keep your
[1:05:08] heart open to the Lord, he's going to re
[1:05:11] he has a life for you. And when he has a
[1:05:14] life for you, he has a plan for you. If
[1:05:16] if I if if you'd have told me when I was
[1:05:18] 18, when I gave uh when I was 21 and I
[1:05:21] gave my life to the Lord, if you'd have
[1:05:22] told me that one day I would be a pastor
[1:05:24] and I would travel and I had five
[1:05:26] children and and all of that, I would
[1:05:27] have panicked. I had no clue that when
[1:05:31] he got me out of the world, this little
[1:05:34] little boy, no name and nobody anxious
[1:05:39] little nobody
[1:05:41] that when God called me, he had a full
[1:05:46] life ahead of me.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Every detail was already prepared. He
[1:05:51] had children. He had a wife. He had a
[1:05:53] life. He had a calling. He had so many
[1:05:55] things. But I was clueless. But that's
[1:05:57] where he became my Lord.
[1:06:01] So I started to have children one after
[1:06:02] the other. We we had a lot of children
[1:06:05] in a short time. We had five in seven
[1:06:07] years. And I do not advise anyone to do
[1:06:10] that. Now today I don't I don't regret
[1:06:12] it. It's it's it's it's marvelous.
[1:06:14] They're all almost the same age and they
[1:06:16] have a lot of fun. But at first it was
[1:06:17] it was a big challenge and and I owe a
[1:06:20] lot to my wife because she came from a
[1:06:23] balanced what let's call it a normal
[1:06:25] family a father and a mother Christian
[1:06:27] serving the Lord and she had they were
[1:06:29] they were five and so she knew what
[1:06:31] family life was she knew what a father
[1:06:33] was she knew what a mom was and so but
[1:06:36] for me I came from such a broken family
[1:06:38] and I never imagined I would be affected
[1:06:41] as a father I never imagined that it
[1:06:44] would it would hinder me.
[1:06:46] And so
[1:06:48] I owe a lot to my wife to kind of kept
[1:06:51] the balance and and so I was I was a
[1:06:53] minister. I loved the Lord, the Holy
[1:06:55] Spirit, and God used you in your
[1:06:57] ministry. But when you come back home, I
[1:07:00] was a poor father because something was
[1:07:02] lacking in my life. Something was
[1:07:04] missing. But at first, I didn't know it.
[1:07:06] And it's until until that I got my third
[1:07:09] child started to realize that something
[1:07:11] was lacking in my life. And and all
[1:07:14] those years even though I became a
[1:07:15] Christian and I was serving God and had
[1:07:18] supernatural experience with God, a call
[1:07:20] in my life, when the anointing was on me
[1:07:21] preaching, I felt I felt invincible. I
[1:07:24] felt so happy. I felt like I was on top
[1:07:27] of everything. But when the anointing
[1:07:29] was leaving, I was fighting depression.
[1:07:32] I was fight I felt I felt broken.
[1:07:36] And that brokenness followed me all the
[1:07:40] time.
[1:07:42] And it became it. So I would I was
[1:07:44] carrying that he heaviness and I was
[1:07:46] wondering why. And so it made me a
[1:07:49] father that was distant that was not
[1:07:51] really involved and and and so and I was
[1:07:55] wondering what's wrong with me. I'm a
[1:07:56] Christian. I'm sure I I'm supposed to be
[1:07:58] happy. But that brokenness
[1:08:02] I was carrying
[1:08:04] this I would I would struggle to get up
[1:08:07] in the morning. Always this this dark
[1:08:09] cloud following you. And when the
[1:08:11] anointing was on me, that cloud would
[1:08:13] leave me and God would use me. But after
[1:08:15] that, I would I would go back to my
[1:08:17] default settings. Now, I had the Holy
[1:08:19] Spirit. I loved the Lord, but something
[1:08:21] was lacking in my life. And I didn't
[1:08:24] know what it was. And I carried that for
[1:08:26] many, many, many, many years.
[1:08:29] And I and I tried to to to to bring
[1:08:32] these things to the Lord and pray. And
[1:08:34] Lord, you know, there's my heart is
[1:08:35] trouble and I don't know what it is. And
[1:08:37] I did a lot of things. Tried to find the
[1:08:39] answer. But I I couldn't find I I
[1:08:43] couldn't find the answer to that
[1:08:45] brokenness, through those defeated
[1:08:48] thoughts, that depression, that that
[1:08:50] depressed feeling that I was carrying.
[1:08:53] When I got close to 40 years old, I
[1:08:56] decided to look for my father.
[1:09:00] And I had this thought. I said I said if
[1:09:02] I don't do it now,
[1:09:05] uh my father was around 70 years old.
[1:09:08] And I and so I my father reappeared in
[1:09:10] my life when I was 22 when I was about
[1:09:12] to get married. So he stayed he was at
[1:09:14] my wedding and then he disappeared again
[1:09:16] for all those years. So when I'm 40
[1:09:18] years old around I think I was 38 I
[1:09:19] start to look for him start to wanted to
[1:09:22] find him and so I I went on Facebook and
[1:09:24] I so my father's Greek so I had to type
[1:09:27] his name and and then type his name type
[1:09:29] I have two brothers over there in Greece
[1:09:31] that doesn't know I exist and so I was
[1:09:34] typing I I know their names so I was
[1:09:36] typing their names and and I spent hours
[1:09:38] and hours on Facebook trying to find
[1:09:40] them and and I couldn't find it until
[1:09:43] I see a picture of my father doing
[1:09:47] barbecue. He's cooking some meat with
[1:09:49] his son, which is my brother. And when I
[1:09:51] saw that picture, it's like it's like I
[1:09:54] was hit by a truck.
[1:09:56] The the the negative impact it was it
[1:09:59] was in my heart my my my head started
[1:10:01] spinning and that question was so that
[1:10:04] sorry that picture was so violent. That
[1:10:07] picture was so brutal because that
[1:10:09] picture was asking a question. It was
[1:10:11] asking the question that I had in my
[1:10:14] heart and I was not aware the level of
[1:10:17] pain when that picture when I saw that
[1:10:20] picture all that pain came out as a
[1:10:22] volcano and I was overwhelmed. I was I
[1:10:26] was it was it was too much because that
[1:10:29] picture was like this is my brother.
[1:10:31] He's allowed to be with his father. He's
[1:10:33] my father. He's my brother. But I'm out
[1:10:35] of that picture. Why? Why that question?
[1:10:38] Why?
[1:10:39] Why I was not allowed to have a normal
[1:10:41] family? Why I was not allowed to be
[1:10:43] raised like other like my friends? They
[1:10:44] had a father. They could do projects.
[1:10:46] They could do this. And I never had
[1:10:48] that. And so I'm a pastor. I'm a
[1:10:50] minister. I have five children. But
[1:10:52] still that that that that that pain that
[1:10:56] I carried, it was still there.
[1:10:59] That brokenness was still there.
[1:11:05] And so I ended up contacting my mother.
[1:11:07] We contacted a friend because my my my
[1:11:09] father was a restaurant owner when he
[1:11:11] was in Quebec and his friend was a
[1:11:13] restaurant owner. So make a long story
[1:11:14] short, he contacted my father. My father
[1:11:16] called me and we ended up making a
[1:11:19] couple of phone calls. And dur during
[1:11:21] the first phone calls, he's like, "You
[1:11:23] know what, Steve?" He said, "Yep." He
[1:11:25] says, "You're going to come to Greece?"
[1:11:26] And he says, "I'm going to have you at
[1:11:28] my home and I'm going to introduce you
[1:11:30] your brothers." And and so when I was on
[1:11:32] the phone, I was so excited. I was like,
[1:11:34] "Finally, I'll have a family. Finally,
[1:11:37] my father's going to receive me in his
[1:11:39] home." And I was so excited. I was so I
[1:11:42] was so looking forward to do this this
[1:11:44] trip in Greece. And finally, because you
[1:11:46] know what? The the a mother's great, but
[1:11:49] what makes it home is the father's home.
[1:11:53] And I never realized that I never felt
[1:11:55] at home even. And that's why I was
[1:11:58] wandering in the streets because I was
[1:12:00] never I never felt I belong anywhere.
[1:12:04] And even when I started my own home with
[1:12:07] my children, I was still wondering. I
[1:12:09] was still I would often leave my wife
[1:12:11] for the children and go out and
[1:12:12] restaurant. Guess what? I was almost
[1:12:14] born in a restaurant. My father was a
[1:12:16] restaurant owner owner. And I would
[1:12:18] leave and my wife would be would be
[1:12:20] puzzled. What what's wrong with my
[1:12:21] husband? Like when he doesn't feel good,
[1:12:22] he leaves the house and he doesn't come
[1:12:24] until late in the afternoon. I was
[1:12:26] wondering and wondering and and it's
[1:12:28] until I realized that my father never
[1:12:31] received me in his home that wandering
[1:12:34] spirit feeling like you don't belong
[1:12:36] nowhere. Now I was a Christian. I still
[1:12:39] I still felt that way.
[1:12:42] And so the next phone call my father
[1:12:45] called me again. He says, "You know
[1:12:46] what, Steve? I thought I thought about
[1:12:47] it and and during that time Greece was
[1:12:50] going through a financial crisis and
[1:12:52] there's riots in the streets and my
[1:12:54] brother has lost their business. They
[1:12:56] lost their money and so my father said,
[1:12:57] "You know what, Steve? It's not a good
[1:12:59] time. Your brother doesn't do good and
[1:13:01] it's not time to come up with, you know,
[1:13:03] family issues like that." So, you know
[1:13:04] what? She says, "When are you going to
[1:13:05] come? We're going to meet in a
[1:13:07] restaurant." And when he said that, I
[1:13:10] just like I just like crush. I hung up
[1:13:13] the phone and I sat on my lazy boy in my
[1:13:16] office and I was I was crushed. Like I
[1:13:20] thought I thought I could make it
[1:13:22] finally and like you're getting your
[1:13:25] door slam in your face. That was so
[1:13:27] brutal.
[1:13:29] And I was so in pain. I remember I open
[1:13:32] I opened my Bible
[1:13:35] and when I opened my Bible
[1:13:39] is that remote you can maybe switch. Uh,
[1:13:42] okay. When I open my Bible,
[1:13:46] I'd open in John 14 verse one and it
[1:13:50] says, "Let not your heart be troubled.
[1:13:53] Ye believe in God, believe also in me.
[1:13:57] In my father's house are many mansions.
[1:14:00] And if it were not so, I would have told
[1:14:02] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:14:06] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[1:14:08] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:14:10] myself, that where I am, there ye may be
[1:14:14] also. Oh, my heart felt so much joy. I
[1:14:19] remember I went up and went to see my
[1:14:21] wife and it says, "Honey, look, the Lord
[1:14:23] just spoke to me." And it was the first
[1:14:25] time, remember I said, "God God was my
[1:14:27] savior." That was that was that was
[1:14:29] clear as clear can be. And he he became
[1:14:32] my Lord. I was a I was like a soldier.
[1:14:34] If if God asked me to do something, yes,
[1:14:36] Lord, he was my Lord. I would, but I was
[1:14:39] like a soldier. But it was the first
[1:14:41] time that God spoke to me as a father.
[1:14:45] And that was totally new to me that he
[1:14:48] would speak to me in the channel of
[1:14:50] being my father. And now when my father
[1:14:53] let me down, God stepped in the scene
[1:14:56] and he became my father. And he said,
[1:14:58] "That man won't receive you in his
[1:15:00] house, but I I prepared a place for you.
[1:15:03] So let your heart not be troubled
[1:15:05] because I was deeply troubled. But now
[1:15:08] my father in heaven stepped down to to
[1:15:12] step down in that brokenness. And he
[1:15:14] told me he said and and he used that
[1:15:16] scripture and I was so I was so blessed.
[1:15:19] I was so touched but still my mind was
[1:15:23] set. I want I want that natural father
[1:15:27] which is a good desire. There's nothing
[1:15:29] wrong about it. And so I kept and so I
[1:15:32] did two trips in Greece with my wife and
[1:15:35] I met him and I remember one of the
[1:15:39] I think it's yes it's on the first trip
[1:15:41] we were sitting there at the the at the
[1:15:44] table and he kept he start to talk to me
[1:15:46] and when he talked to me he he he he
[1:15:48] touched my arm like this and when he
[1:15:51] touched my arm
[1:15:53] my head started like you know like you
[1:15:56] know when everything shift and I look at
[1:15:59] him and I was like whoa
[1:16:04] the touch of a father.
[1:16:06] I didn't know what it was. And so me be
[1:16:10] be being so distant with my own
[1:16:12] children. Guess what? When I came back
[1:16:14] from that trip, I knew now the power of
[1:16:18] a father, just a touch of a father, what
[1:16:20] it means for a child. You actually
[1:16:23] you're telling your son, you're telling
[1:16:24] your daughter, you actually you exist.
[1:16:27] You're affirming them. you're and so
[1:16:29] that's where I got the revelation. I was
[1:16:31] 40 some but when my father touched me I
[1:16:35] realized oh my goodness
[1:16:37] and so the third trip we went and I
[1:16:41] wanted my father to meet my children. So
[1:16:44] guess what you know at grandpa usually
[1:16:45] you meet your grandkids one at a time
[1:16:48] every year, two years, three years. He
[1:16:50] met his all five within 15 minutes. And
[1:16:53] so they all went on the on the in the
[1:16:55] separate room and all dressed nice and
[1:16:57] we were sitting in the living room and
[1:16:59] then I I I I introduced every child one
[1:17:02] at a time and this is uh William and
[1:17:04] this is Mary and oh nice to meet you
[1:17:06] Mary and we all sat in the living room
[1:17:09] and when we sat in the living room the
[1:17:12] one of the first thing he told my kids
[1:17:14] is you are Greek
[1:17:18] and it was so important for him for for
[1:17:20] my children to understand you're not
[1:17:22] Canadian you're not from Quebec. You are
[1:17:24] Greek and don't let anyone tell you
[1:17:27] otherwise. You have Greek blood and you
[1:17:28] are Greek. And so that's him talking in
[1:17:31] the living room and all kids looking and
[1:17:33] thinking that was quite funny. And
[1:17:37] and I realized that for him, you know,
[1:17:39] the origin was really important. And
[1:17:42] that really inspired me a message that
[1:17:43] I'm not preaching tonight, but what is
[1:17:46] our real origin?
[1:17:48] When Jesus came on earth, he says, "I
[1:17:50] come from God.
[1:17:52] and I go back to God. On your first
[1:17:55] birth here on earth, born of this flesh,
[1:17:58] you have origin. You're from Tucson.
[1:18:00] You're from this. You're from that
[1:18:01] country, that country. But when you're
[1:18:03] born again,
[1:18:05] there's something different setting in.
[1:18:07] Your origin isn't from heaven because
[1:18:10] you're born of the spirit of God and and
[1:18:12] your name was in that book and that's
[1:18:15] your true origin and that changes
[1:18:17] everything.
[1:18:19] And so we were sitting there in the
[1:18:20] living room and then we we moved on to
[1:18:22] the kitchen around the table and we
[1:18:25] started talking and and and my father's
[1:18:27] Greek so he's the Greek are like that,
[1:18:29] the Arabs are like that and I think the
[1:18:31] Jews are like that. So the lineage is
[1:18:33] really important. The lineage goes
[1:18:34] through the son. So I have four
[1:18:36] daughters but one's missing is my my my
[1:18:39] son, my oldest son. He's he's married
[1:18:41] and he has a he has a baby, so he
[1:18:43] doesn't follow us anymore. So he has his
[1:18:46] own life now. But so my father totally
[1:18:49] turned towards my my son and and yeah
[1:18:52] the girls are nice. Oh, you're cute
[1:18:53] girls. But now he focused my son because
[1:18:56] now he wanted to transfer all his
[1:18:58] wisdom. You know when the Bible says
[1:19:00] that that uh Greeks require a sign, but
[1:19:05] the uh Jews require a sign, but the
[1:19:08] Greek seeks after wisdom. I've witnessed
[1:19:10] that. He was sitting there at the table
[1:19:13] and you look he's like this and he's
[1:19:14] he's talking to his his his grandson. is
[1:19:16] like, you know, you got to think, son.
[1:19:18] And he's trying to transfer all his
[1:19:20] wisdom and he's there giving all kinds
[1:19:22] of advice about life and about this and
[1:19:25] but he's not a Christian. So all his
[1:19:26] wisdom was not worth much because it was
[1:19:29] not based on the Bible. So, we're all
[1:19:31] listening to him and and and but he's at
[1:19:34] my son and he's like, you know, William,
[1:19:36] now you need to realize this is really
[1:19:37] important in life and when you get
[1:19:39] married, you got to find this kind of
[1:19:40] wife and and don't let her and this and
[1:19:42] that and oh, he had a lot to say. And
[1:19:44] we're all sitting there and listening.
[1:19:47] And then at one point he get to this and
[1:19:48] he said, he says, "You know what,
[1:19:50] William?" He said, "There's something I
[1:19:51] want you to learn." He says, "There's a
[1:19:54] song I want you to listen." He says, "I
[1:19:56] want you to listen to that song every
[1:19:58] day." And he says that song if you
[1:20:01] listen it to every day you're going to
[1:20:02] get something out of that song every
[1:20:04] day. It's like for us when we read the
[1:20:05] Bible we might have read the verse many
[1:20:08] time but the word is alive. It's not
[1:20:11] just letters. It's more than letters.
[1:20:12] It's spirit and life. So you read the
[1:20:14] scripture you know it but but it's
[1:20:16] alive. You get something out of your
[1:20:17] Bible even though you read it before.
[1:20:19] And so he was applying the same
[1:20:21] principle for that song. And he says
[1:20:22] it's really important. We were all
[1:20:24] curious what is that song? He says
[1:20:27] William it's really important. you got
[1:20:28] to listen to this, listen to that. And
[1:20:30] so at at one point it says and the song
[1:20:32] is he says it's it's I did it my way
[1:20:35] from Frank Sinatra.
[1:20:39] But now brother Matt Watkins uh Matthew
[1:20:42] you know you know he's he's been here
[1:20:44] one of my close friend. And so he had
[1:20:46] been at our church a couple of months
[1:20:49] before and he had spoke about that song
[1:20:51] of Frank Sinatra. I did it my way. And
[1:20:54] he he told the church he preached and he
[1:20:56] says this is one of the most satanic
[1:20:58] song out there because it's I did it my
[1:21:01] way. And actually Elvis Presley one of
[1:21:04] his last show maybe his last show he
[1:21:05] pulled out a paper out of his pocket and
[1:21:07] he turned to his band and that's what he
[1:21:09] sang. He's saying, "I did it my way."
[1:21:11] Because that song is like it pretty much
[1:21:13] it says, you know, I've I've I've I've
[1:21:16] lived the life I wanted and I and I
[1:21:18] sometime, you know, I I took a bite that
[1:21:20] I could barely chew, but at the end I
[1:21:23] don't, the song says pretty much I live
[1:21:25] the life I wanted and at the end I don't
[1:21:27] regret it. Why? Because I did it my way.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; And so it's self-will, you know, and all
[1:21:33] that. And so, Brother Matt had preached
[1:21:36] that this is so this is the most satanic
[1:21:38] song. And there my father's trying to
[1:21:41] tell my son that he needs to listen to
[1:21:43] that every day and he going to learn
[1:21:44] something and get something out of it
[1:21:46] every day. So we all look at each other
[1:21:48] around the table with a smirk, you know,
[1:21:50] respectfully. We I respected my dad. We
[1:21:52] didn't say nothing but we were like,
[1:21:54] "Okay."
[1:21:58] And so that night I went to bed
[1:22:03] and I don't know if I slept that night
[1:22:05] because my that night felt like a vision
[1:22:10] and all I can remember is that
[1:22:14] the full night was God showed me my
[1:22:16] whole life and that was an appointment
[1:22:19] that night that God had set up for me. I
[1:22:21] I I didn't see it coming.
[1:22:23] And the first thing he did is he showed
[1:22:25] me when I was in the street wandering
[1:22:28] and he showed me at a young boy and he
[1:22:30] showed me the street of my of my youth
[1:22:32] where I was wandering in the streets and
[1:22:35] he showed me that I was going from store
[1:22:37] to store and one of the store was a
[1:22:39] sports store because for me when I was
[1:22:41] young I I try to compensate that that
[1:22:44] emptiness and that anxiety with like and
[1:22:46] trying to find some comfort and find
[1:22:48] some identity in sport. So I was I was
[1:22:51] in sport heavy a lot. And so he showed
[1:22:54] me I'm I'm I'm I'm in the window and
[1:22:56] looking at the sports store. Then I go
[1:22:59] to the next store and it's an adult, you
[1:23:01] know, a perversion, sexual stores with
[1:23:03] with all and and and he shows me all the
[1:23:05] temptation of my childhood and how I'm
[1:23:08] wandering and I'm and I'm and I'm have
[1:23:10] nowhere to go and I'm I'm going into one
[1:23:12] temptation after the other.
[1:23:16] And then God told me and he said, "Then
[1:23:18] he showed me
[1:23:23] my son and my dad talking at the table,
[1:23:26] but now I'm outside the picture and I'm
[1:23:28] looking and he says, "You see now," he
[1:23:30] says, "you see your father how he's
[1:23:32] talking to your son." He says, "Your son
[1:23:36] would have been you."
[1:23:38] And he said, "If I would have let you
[1:23:41] being raised by that man, he would have
[1:23:43] fill you and confuse you and fill your
[1:23:46] head with all that nonsense."
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; And and he showed me and then it it
[1:23:52] struck me because yes, William was me
[1:23:54] and that was my father. And he so God
[1:23:56] told me, he says, "That's why I removed
[1:23:58] this man out of your life because I had
[1:24:01] a call for you. had a special call and I
[1:24:04] didn't allow that man to stay in your
[1:24:06] life to confuse you because he has no
[1:24:08] part in the inheritance and in the call
[1:24:11] I have for you.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And then he showed me that at a at a
[1:24:16] young age where my mom brought me to
[1:24:18] church and that the voice of my father
[1:24:21] was replaced by the voice of the prophet
[1:24:23] William Brham and that was the male
[1:24:26] voice that carried me all my childhood.
[1:24:29] A voice that would guide me. a voice on
[1:24:31] earth that would guide me.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; And then he showed me while I was
[1:24:36] driving from Athen to Patras, which is
[1:24:38] the city of my father. I was driving the
[1:24:41] car and kids were sleeping in the back
[1:24:42] and I had a message of William Brown
[1:24:44] playing and he showed me, he says, "You
[1:24:46] see," and he showed me me in the car
[1:24:48] listening to that voice and God told me
[1:24:51] and he says, "I've I've replaced the
[1:24:54] voice of your father by that voice."
[1:24:57] And he said, and he says, 'The reason
[1:25:00] why I did that is because I have I have
[1:25:02] called you and you have a special call.
[1:25:06] And now when God talks to you like that,
[1:25:10] I can say that when I went to bed that
[1:25:12] night, I went to bed as a victim of
[1:25:14] life, a fatherless kid, broken. And I
[1:25:20] was still carrying that brokenness with
[1:25:22] me. Even though I was loving the Lord, I
[1:25:24] was married. I had I had wonderful kids.
[1:25:27] I had a ministry. I would carry and
[1:25:29] fight that brokenness. But when that
[1:25:32] night God revealed that to me, I can say
[1:25:35] that I went I went in bed that night as
[1:25:37] a victim of life. But when I get up that
[1:25:39] morning, I I I got up out of the bed as
[1:25:41] a VIP of the Lord. I felt special. I
[1:25:45] felt reserved. And that's where God
[1:25:47] stepped in my life in a greater measure
[1:25:49] than my savior, my lord. But that's
[1:25:52] where he became my father. And he
[1:25:54] revealed to me the purpose of my life
[1:25:57] which I already partially knew because I
[1:25:59] was preaching. I knew I was serving God.
[1:26:01] But it took such a level such a it it
[1:26:04] filled my heart in such a level. I've
[1:26:06] I've never been the same man after that.
[1:26:09] It it that experiences transformed me
[1:26:12] because God has revealed to me the
[1:26:14] purpose of my life.
[1:26:18] If God would not have a purpose behind
[1:26:20] your trial,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; if God would not have a purpose behind
[1:26:24] your broken life,
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; I've heard testimony in all testimony,
[1:26:29] you had a I would say a more broken
[1:26:32] background. Mine was soft, but it broke
[1:26:34] me anyway.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; If your heart's broken, it's broken. So,
[1:26:37] it's not about who got broke the more
[1:26:39] the most.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Broken is broken, brother.
[1:26:43] But God wants to come down and reveal
[1:26:47] the reason. He has a plan. And what I
[1:26:51] thought was unfair, what I thought was a
[1:26:53] mistake, what I thought what God where
[1:26:56] was God, where did did he did he see
[1:26:58] that and did nothing.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; But when God steps down in your life and
[1:27:03] reveal I have a purpose.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; I am doing something. And your childhood
[1:27:08] is part of a plan of something I want to
[1:27:11] do for you later. And I remember one day
[1:27:13] I was like, Lord, why why I'M SO BROKEN?
[1:27:16] WHY WHY WAS I raised in such a sad
[1:27:19] environment? And it was just such
[1:27:21] brokenness. And and and there also
[1:27:23] another thing God told me. He said, God
[1:27:25] says, I want to use that.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; This is why in my in not my ministry,
[1:27:30] but the Lord, the ministry he gave me, I
[1:27:31] have such a burden for family. I have
[1:27:34] such burden for youth. I have such
[1:27:36] burden for people who have such a broken
[1:27:38] background because I I feel it.
[1:27:42] But I'm also a witness that God God
[1:27:45] wants to step down in your life and have
[1:27:48] a personal conversation with you.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And that night, God told me, he said, "I
[1:27:54] would have told you before,
[1:27:57] but he says, you didn't want to listen
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; because that day on the lazy boy, God
[1:28:02] already said I am your father, but I
[1:28:05] kept wanting that my way. I want that. I
[1:28:09] want that." and I had to go to that
[1:28:11] journey.
[1:28:12] But there was an appointment for me in
[1:28:14] Greece that night. I woke up that
[1:28:16] morning a different man. And that night
[1:28:19] felt like I I felt like I didn't sleep.
[1:28:22] I felt like my whole night was a vision
[1:28:25] where God was speaking to me. And what
[1:28:28] is amazing is that when God tells you
[1:28:31] something, when God reveals you
[1:28:33] something, he doesn't give you
[1:28:35] information.
[1:28:37] A revelation from God is not
[1:28:39] information. A revelation from God is
[1:28:42] like he's downloading in you a new
[1:28:44] identity.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; When I got up that morning is not like,
[1:28:47] oh, now I know that this was better.
[1:28:50] When I got up that morning, I became
[1:28:53] that.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; It's not I know. I feel it. This is now
[1:28:57] who I am. Now when I got up that
[1:29:00] morning, I would have been the one to
[1:29:01] say that was the best for me.
[1:29:06] That was the best thing he could do
[1:29:08] because what God had in store for me was
[1:29:10] better than whatever my dad could
[1:29:12] provide for me.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Now, that story doesn't apply to
[1:29:16] everyone. Some of you have had good
[1:29:18] fathers, Christian fathers, or even a
[1:29:19] good father who was there for you. And
[1:29:21] so, that story doesn't apply. You don't
[1:29:23] have to kick your father out of your
[1:29:24] life to for God to be your father. But
[1:29:27] it's just an example that whatever
[1:29:30] whatever was broken in your life,
[1:29:32] whatever whatever you think that is it
[1:29:34] it it was a mistake and it was an
[1:29:36] injustice and it was never supposed to
[1:29:38] be that way. I invite you to have a
[1:29:42] conversation with Lord with the Lord and
[1:29:44] say Lord
[1:29:46] because the victim question is why did I
[1:29:49] go through this and it was an injustice
[1:29:51] and the victim questions because we
[1:29:53] still we ask victim questions we remain
[1:29:56] a victim
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; because the dialogue is all about me
[1:30:00] being a victim and me suffering and I
[1:30:02] and and I know what it is. I've asked
[1:30:04] victim questions way too long. But the
[1:30:07] other question is a freedom question is
[1:30:09] Lord was there a purpose for that
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; did did like you just looking somewhere
[1:30:16] else and then Satan sleeping and destroy
[1:30:19] my family
[1:30:21] or was it part of a plan and Lord if
[1:30:24] that was part of a plan what were you
[1:30:26] doing can you show it to me and that
[1:30:30] changes you because you're no more a
[1:30:32] victim of life
[1:30:35] you're part of a greater plan.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:30:41] Jesus says in the same scripture John 14
[1:30:44] we read verse 1 2 and three but John 14
[1:30:47] verse 18 it's the Lord says I will not
[1:30:50] leave you comfortless
[1:30:53] now the word comfortless in Greek is
[1:30:58] orphanos orphanos which mean fatherless
[1:31:05] which is sense but it's not just orphan
[1:31:07] because orphan in America and the way we
[1:31:11] use is both parents are missing
[1:31:14] but in that Greek word the general
[1:31:16] meaning of that Greek word comfortless
[1:31:18] which mean orphan or fatherless means
[1:31:21] deprive of parental protection.
[1:31:24] So sometime you had parents but you were
[1:31:28] not protected
[1:31:30] and a child has not been protected will
[1:31:33] be broken.
[1:31:35] But Jesus said I will not leave you
[1:31:38] deprived of parent parental protection
[1:31:42] because he says I will come to you.
[1:31:46] Jesus says I will come to you. That's a
[1:31:49] promise and I'm a witness tonight that
[1:31:52] he came. And some of you might say he
[1:31:55] came late. Yeah, he came late because I
[1:31:57] start to ask those question late.
[1:32:00] And then when I start to ask those
[1:32:01] question, I asked those questions for
[1:32:02] many years and the Lord says I would
[1:32:04] have told you I would have come before.
[1:32:07] But says you didn't want to. Because
[1:32:09] sometimes you know what we ask a
[1:32:11] question but we already want the answer
[1:32:14] we want.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Why I didn't have a father? Because I I
[1:32:23] I feel pity for myself. Why? It is
[1:32:25] because I'm a victim. Because well,
[1:32:27] nothing good can happen to me. I was
[1:32:30] always negative. If something bad,
[1:32:32] you're doing something, you're doing
[1:32:33] your project and it fails. Now, of
[1:32:34] course, of course, it fails. Of course,
[1:32:36] because I touch it's going to fail.
[1:32:37] Yeah, I know. And and we feel this way.
[1:32:39] And it's and and and when we speak like
[1:32:41] that, we speak from our brokenness. And
[1:32:45] my wife would like, Steve, stop talking
[1:32:46] about it because she didn't feel this
[1:32:48] way. No, it didn't work. So you you you
[1:32:50] do it and it's going to work. No, no,
[1:32:52] no. It's because I touched it.
[1:32:53] Everything I touched doesn't work. And
[1:32:55] you're mad. You're mad after life.
[1:32:56] You're mad everything. And of course,
[1:32:58] after a while, you just sabotage
[1:33:00] yourself. You kind of auto prophesy
[1:33:02] yourself to failure.
[1:33:04] And it's a vicious cycle. It's a
[1:33:06] defeated life. But when we when we're
[1:33:08] like that, we do it from our brokenness.
[1:33:11] But God says Jesus says, "I will come to
[1:33:14] you."
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's his desire. and and I'm a witness
[1:33:18] tonight that he did it for me. And if he
[1:33:20] did it for me, he can do it for you.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Psalm 68 says
[1:33:28] that he wants to be a father of the
[1:33:31] fatherless
[1:33:33] and a judge of the widows
[1:33:37] is God in his holy habitation. So
[1:33:39] fatherless here in the Old Testament
[1:33:41] means to to be lonely. He wants to be a
[1:33:46] father to those who are lonely. I can
[1:33:49] spell spell lonely. There's I'm sure
[1:33:52] there's people here who knows that. But
[1:33:53] I want you to know
[1:33:55] that God wants to be the father of those
[1:33:59] who's been lonely.
[1:34:02] He's He's real. And that's our opening
[1:34:04] scripture we talked about here.
[1:34:08] The Lord is nigh
[1:34:11] unto them that are of a broken heart.
[1:34:17] He's nigh. He wants to come close to
[1:34:19] you. But sometime we feel like because
[1:34:22] we have that brokenness, we feel that
[1:34:25] this disqualify us from having a
[1:34:28] relationship with God.
[1:34:30] And what I want to show you through the
[1:34:32] scripture is that the Lord's promise is
[1:34:35] that I'm getting close to those who are
[1:34:38] broken. But for us, we feel
[1:34:40] disqualified. Lord, I'm way too broken.
[1:34:43] I'm I'm shattered to pieces. There's
[1:34:44] nothing you can do. I'm not I'm no good
[1:34:46] for nothing. But the Bible says the
[1:34:48] contrary. He health the broken in heart.
[1:34:52] Now, broken heart here in the Old
[1:34:54] Testament, if you break up the word is
[1:34:55] inner man broke in pieces. The inner man
[1:34:59] is broke in pieces.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; And we had testimony yesterday. I think
[1:35:04] I heard that, you know, shattered
[1:35:06] inside. You might look great outside,
[1:35:08] but inside it's shattered. It's broken.
[1:35:11] The Lord says, "I want to be close for
[1:35:14] to to them that are brokenhearted." He's
[1:35:17] interested in you. But sometime we feel
[1:35:19] our brokenness disqualify us. But Jesus
[1:35:22] says, "No, that's not the case." And so
[1:35:24] when we talk about the good news of the
[1:35:26] gospel, you know gospel means good news.
[1:35:29] There is a good news
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; and that was prophesied in the Old
[1:35:33] Testament in Isaiah 61 when Isaiah
[1:35:36] prophesies the spirit of the Lord of God
[1:35:38] is upon me because the Lord hath
[1:35:39] anointed me to preach good tidings uh
[1:35:41] unto the meek and he has sent me to bind
[1:35:44] up the brokenhearted to proclaim
[1:35:46] liberty. So when Jesus was in the temple
[1:35:48] and he opened the scroll that's the
[1:35:51] scripture he read and you find out in
[1:35:53] the book of Luke 4:18 and he repeat that
[1:35:56] same scriptures and he read it and he
[1:35:58] says the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:36:00] because he had anointed me to preach the
[1:36:02] gospel. What's the meaning of the word
[1:36:04] gospel? Gospel mean it's a good news.
[1:36:08] The good news is what? I came to heal
[1:36:11] the brokenhearted. I came to heal those
[1:36:14] that the inner man is broken and
[1:36:16] shattered in pieces
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; which we felt for many years that that
[1:36:21] was that would disqualify us that would
[1:36:23] keep us away. We don't deserve to be in
[1:36:25] church. I'm way too broken. People in
[1:36:27] church are perfect. And that's why I was
[1:36:29] talking yesterday as a church. We need
[1:36:31] to be geared toward receiving people.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; That are broken. And the reason I open
[1:36:38] my heart tonight is maybe you look at me
[1:36:40] as a pastor and says, "Well, he got all
[1:36:41] figured out and he has beautiful
[1:36:43] children. They all No, you need to know
[1:36:46] that God can take a broken pieces,
[1:36:49] broken vessel and restore it and build
[1:36:52] it and give it a life. [applause]
[1:37:00] That call is not for perfect people or
[1:37:02] people who look good. He take us there
[1:37:04] on the side of the streets and he built
[1:37:06] us back. That's my title tonight. Built
[1:37:09] from brokenness.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; That's why I opened my heart because
[1:37:16] sometime people they come to church and
[1:37:17] say, "Oh, people in church, they look
[1:37:19] all perfect." That's why even though you
[1:37:20] are in church for many years, never
[1:37:23] forget where you come from.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Because if you forget where you come
[1:37:27] from, you'll never able to receive
[1:37:30] broken people.
[1:37:32] That's good.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; But if you remember where you come from,
[1:37:36] you're never that far in saying, "Lord,
[1:37:38] you did it to me. You can do it for this
[1:37:41] man. Come out of the street and he's all
[1:37:43] broken and all he's all in pieces, but
[1:37:46] you receive it with our wide arms."
[1:37:48] Because like you you and you have a
[1:37:50] testimony, God, I was broken like you
[1:37:53] were broke. There's hope
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; and you become a witness in your own
[1:37:58] church. And that's how a church can be
[1:38:00] welcoming. It's a church. The church is
[1:38:03] supposed to be a hospital.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; So Jesus says, "I came to heal the
[1:38:13] brokenhearted." That's the first when he
[1:38:16] gave his mission.
[1:38:18] That's what he says. That's why I came.
[1:38:22] I came to heal the brokenhearted, to
[1:38:25] preach deliverance to the captives, and
[1:38:27] recovering of sight to the blind, and
[1:38:29] set at liberty them that are bruises. Do
[1:38:31] you know that there's a link to all
[1:38:32] those words? It's a link of cause and
[1:38:35] effect. Because brokenhearted,
[1:38:38] when you're brokenhearted, it will lead
[1:38:40] you to captivity. Because out of our
[1:38:43] brokenness, that's that's why we that's
[1:38:45] WHY WE DRINK. THAT'S WHY WE DO DRUGS,
[1:38:47] because we're trying to find comfort.
[1:38:50] That's why we go in sexual perversion
[1:38:52] because we're trying to kill the pain
[1:38:54] and alcohol and per sexual perversion.
[1:38:57] These are all painkillers
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; and and and well, you know, you know,
[1:39:01] well, well, I was really bad. I went so
[1:39:03] far. But you know what? If you take
[1:39:07] aspirin,
[1:39:09] if I see you take one aspirin, tilenol,
[1:39:12] I'm like, okay, you know, you got a
[1:39:14] headache. You know, I understand you
[1:39:16] take one. But if I see you take the
[1:39:19] whole butt onto like, "Oh man, he's
[1:39:21] really in pain." I mean, woo. All right.
[1:39:24] It's the same thing. How far went you
[1:39:27] did you go to the word in the world? How
[1:39:29] deep did you go? Will tell me how much
[1:39:32] pain you had inside.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You had to go so far just to try to find
[1:39:38] comfort.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; The devil has a lot of violent
[1:39:41] substitute. But Jesus said, "I will send
[1:39:44] you the comforter."
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. For many years, I wondered why why
[1:39:47] why comforter until God showed me be my
[1:39:51] own brokenness because I didn't realize
[1:39:53] I was carrying that heaviness and that
[1:39:55] brokenness and I didn't realize I was
[1:39:56] carrying it. I thought I was all right
[1:39:58] because I was a Christian.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I thought I thought me becoming
[1:40:01] Christian has fixed me everything.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; But when I realized that I was not
[1:40:05] handling my family right and I was
[1:40:07] looking in my own children eyes that
[1:40:09] they they they were afraid of me. There
[1:40:11] was something that was lacking. I said,
[1:40:12] "Lord, there's something I'm broken. I'm
[1:40:15] not able to give.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; I didn't receive it. I'm not able to
[1:40:19] give it.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; So, was I condemned? Was I condemned to
[1:40:24] be a poor father all my life? Or God was
[1:40:28] able to restore me
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; so I can become the father that I didn't
[1:40:31] have?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; So that generational curse can stop.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And that's why the the privilege of the
[1:40:37] new birth is so amazing because it
[1:40:40] stopped generational curse. Your family
[1:40:42] was drinking and they were drunker and
[1:40:44] they were destroying the family. New
[1:40:46] birth. God steps in your life and say it
[1:40:48] stops with you.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; This is the good news. It stop with you
[1:40:51] and I will not change you on the
[1:40:53] outward. I will heal your brokenness
[1:40:55] because all your bad behavior is caused
[1:40:58] by the brokenness inside of you. So I'm
[1:41:00] going to heal, restore, remove that
[1:41:02] brokenness. And your taste and your
[1:41:05] thirst and your desire will change. You
[1:41:07] won't desire destruction anymore because
[1:41:09] I'll remove the destruction from inside
[1:41:11] of you.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So brokenhearted leads us to
[1:41:16] captivity. We become captives. We become
[1:41:20] we become bound to addiction. Why?
[1:41:22] Because we're broken.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; And when we're captive, it brings us in
[1:41:28] blindness. We become blind to the style
[1:41:31] of life. Like our brother testified. He
[1:41:32] says, he says, "I didn't realize I
[1:41:34] destroyed life. I didn't realize I
[1:41:36] destroyed family because why? Because of
[1:41:38] the brokenness. You become captive. You
[1:41:40] become addicted. And be when you're
[1:41:42] addicted, you become BLIND TO TO ALL THE
[1:41:45] BAD THAT we do.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And when we do that, WE GET BRUISED EVEN
[1:41:49] MORE. YOU SEE THE CYCLE? And out of that
[1:41:51] bruise, out of our brokenness, we repeat
[1:41:53] the cycle and we go down. we go down
[1:41:55] until the Lord steps in our life and
[1:41:57] brings light and brings the blood of
[1:41:59] Jesus that can cleanse our heart and
[1:42:02] change our life and heal that brokenness
[1:42:04] and that is the good news of the gospel.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:11] In closing,
[1:42:18] I'm just coming back from Congo and I
[1:42:20] preached to a lot of people. I preach to
[1:42:23] most people I never seen in my life.
[1:42:25] Thousands of people can't go there, big
[1:42:27] churches and and and I and I and I and I
[1:42:30] preach on the these kind of things and
[1:42:33] because you know what sometimes churches
[1:42:34] they get caught up into they want the
[1:42:36] big spiritual things, the mysteries and
[1:42:38] the depth of God and it it's all good. I
[1:42:40] don't I don't despise that. It's part of
[1:42:42] the gospel.
[1:42:44] But sometime we forgot the basics
[1:42:47] and while we feast on great spiritual
[1:42:50] things and we go back in our home and
[1:42:54] our homes are still broken.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And so I did this family series in two
[1:42:58] cities in Congo and pre preached to
[1:43:00] thousands of people
[1:43:02] and I was I was exhausted. I was it's
[1:43:04] it's it's really asking you a lot. And
[1:43:06] then I got on the plane and I they
[1:43:09] closed the line in the plane. People are
[1:43:11] falling asleep and I'm sitting there and
[1:43:13] suddenly it strikes me and God showed me
[1:43:16] the little boy I was in my little when I
[1:43:20] was young this little broken boy that I
[1:43:23] was and then he showed me preaching to
[1:43:26] thousands of people and then I started
[1:43:28] crying
[1:43:31] and that's where God showed me he says
[1:43:32] you know what I took this little boy
[1:43:36] this broken little boy but because you
[1:43:39] gave that brokenness goodness to me.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I was able to take you and bring you and
[1:43:45] use you in a way that you never thought
[1:43:48] would be possible.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And it reminded me of that story
[1:43:54] of that little boy. You know, one day
[1:44:00] there was thousands of people. They were
[1:44:01] starving.
[1:44:03] Jesus finished preaching and there's no
[1:44:05] food and people are starving and they're
[1:44:08] looking for bread and they're looking
[1:44:09] and and finally there's a little boy who
[1:44:11] steps in. He has a lunchbox and that
[1:44:14] that boy steps in with his lunchbox and
[1:44:16] he has five loaf of bread and two small
[1:44:19] fish. That's all he had which was which
[1:44:23] compared feeding 5,000 men is nothing.
[1:44:26] And there's a there's a powerful lesson
[1:44:28] there because that lunchbox
[1:44:32] in the hands of that boy was nothing.
[1:44:35] But when when that young boy brought
[1:44:37] that lunchbox to the Lord and gave
[1:44:40] whatever he had,
[1:44:42] God took that and was able to feed 5,000
[1:44:46] men, not counting the children and not
[1:44:47] counting the the woman.
[1:44:50] And that's what God showed me in that
[1:44:52] plane. He says, "Because you gave me
[1:44:54] your brokenness. You didn't run away
[1:44:56] from me. You came to me." And sometime
[1:44:59] we feel so little. Especially if you're
[1:45:01] a new convert, you're just coming to
[1:45:02] church. You feel overwhelmed. Lord, like
[1:45:04] where where do I start? And and I see
[1:45:06] those Christians, they've been there for
[1:45:07] years. And what can you do with me? And
[1:45:09] and and the devil want to step in and
[1:45:11] discourage you like there's you're
[1:45:12] nothing and you're never amount to
[1:45:14] nothing. And my my my final say tonight
[1:45:16] is bring your two fish and your five
[1:45:19] bread.
[1:45:20] Well, I don't have five forever. Bring
[1:45:22] whatever you had. Bring your nothingness
[1:45:24] to the Lord and see him multiplied for
[1:45:27] his glory because it won't be about you.
[1:45:30] I'm not here tonight about myself. Even
[1:45:32] though I gave my testimony, it's not
[1:45:34] about myself. It's about what God wants
[1:45:37] to do in your life. It's about you
[1:45:39] tonight.
[1:45:43] Bring this brokenness.
[1:45:45] bring this life of you think you some
[1:45:48] some of us were so broken we despise our
[1:45:51] I was so had such a spirit of such a
[1:45:54] defeated spirit I would I would despise
[1:45:56] myself that's what brokenness do we we
[1:46:00] don't we we have such a low self-esteem
[1:46:05] so we feel like running away from God
[1:46:06] like I'm not worthy and it's not even
[1:46:08] you even though if I don't show up at
[1:46:10] church nobody cares even God won't see
[1:46:12] it and and we we carry those thoughts
[1:46:14] those defeated thoughts, negative
[1:46:16] thoughts.
[1:46:18] Imagine if that young man, young boy
[1:46:20] sitting there, he's looking his lung
[1:46:21] brush like,
[1:46:25] forget it. Like, who has food? Like,
[1:46:29] better hide it.
[1:46:32] Stop hiding whatever you have in your
[1:46:34] life.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; It's not much. It's negative. I have
[1:46:37] nothing to bring. Bring this
[1:46:38] nothingness.
[1:46:40] Believe me tonight if you can hear my
[1:46:42] voice. Bring whatever you have and give
[1:46:44] it to the Lord and watch for the
[1:46:47] miracle.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:46:54] Now, I want you to
[1:46:57] a lot's been said, but I want you to
[1:47:00] pause tonight
[1:47:02] and meditate on those things. And
[1:47:05] maybe the Lord maybe while I was
[1:47:07] preaching the Lord was showing your
[1:47:09] life.
[1:47:10] You had pictures coming to your mind.
[1:47:12] You had you had images of your
[1:47:14] childhood. You have images of your
[1:47:16] brokenness. Maybe some of you had tears
[1:47:18] while I'm talking because you still feel
[1:47:20] it inside.
[1:47:22] And my words tonight that are inspired
[1:47:24] by the Lord gave you hope.
[1:47:27] Lord, if you did it for for this man,
[1:47:30] you can do it for me.
[1:47:38] And we want to invite the Lord tonight
[1:47:40] to step in the scene to come in your pew
[1:47:43] to come to your chair.
[1:47:50] And while that we they sing this song, I
[1:47:52] want you to keep your eyes closed
[1:47:55] and let those words in that song and the
[1:47:57] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit speak to
[1:47:59] your heart. And I want you to invite
[1:48:01] Jesus to your chair to your heart
[1:48:03] tonight and say, "Lord,
[1:48:05] can you take Can you take that
[1:48:07] brokenness? Was there a purpose for this
[1:48:10] life? I never thought that it would make
[1:48:14] sense,
[1:48:16] but is it possible, Lord, that you were
[1:48:19] shaping me? Is it possible that you were
[1:48:21] molding me for a plan for the future? Is
[1:48:24] it possible that this pastor right now,
[1:48:26] is it possible that he's saying the
[1:48:27] truth? that there's hope for me that
[1:48:30] from that nothingness that brokenness
[1:48:32] actually you were doing something that
[1:48:35] maybe Lord even you're going to use that
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; while this song is singing right now
[1:48:43] take that time with the Lord open your
[1:48:46] heart to the presence of the Lord let
[1:48:48] him mend your heart let him soften your
[1:48:51] heart in the name of Jesus
[1:49:07] the healer [singing] of my heart.
[1:49:14] The maker and the [singing] God of
[1:49:17] [music] all we are.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:25] Oh,
[1:49:29] I was the broken [singing]
[1:49:34] [music]
[1:49:37] vessel [singing] in your hand.
[1:49:43] You look beyond the hurt and made me
[1:49:47] whole [singing]
[1:49:49] again.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Healer of the [singing] broken pieces.
[1:49:59] [music]
[1:50:02] You [singing] touched my heart and made
[1:50:04] it new.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:07] Yes, Lord.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Now my whole life [singing] I surrender.
[1:50:12] [music]
[1:50:13] Lay it down before the men. Lord, I
[1:50:18] [singing] give my heart to you.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Give my heart to you. Lord, take my
[1:50:23] heart, Lord.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Take this broken heart
[1:50:26] before I knew you [music]
[1:50:32] has [singing] brought me near to where
[1:50:35] you are.
[1:50:37] [music]
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Now I live to praise [music and singing]
[1:50:43] you.
[1:50:45] Ever may I praise you,
[1:50:48] healer of my [singing and music]
[1:50:51] heart.
[1:50:59] Nothing compares [singing]
[1:51:02] Lord [music]
[1:51:07] to knowing [music]
[1:51:08] [singing]
[1:51:09] you
[1:51:14] and [music and singing] seeing what the
[1:51:16] grace of God can do.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] praise. Oh, [singing]
[1:51:28] you [music] faithfully
[1:51:30] love me
[1:51:35] [music]
[1:51:36] and call me [singing]
[1:51:38] your own.
[1:51:42] Then made a way [singing]
[1:51:44] to bring my [music] wondering heart back
[1:51:49] home.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Healer of the broken [singing]
[1:51:57] pieces.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; You touched my heart. [music] You
[1:52:01] touched my heart and made [singing] it
[1:52:04] new.
[1:52:07] My whole life
[1:52:09] now. My whole life I [music and singing]
[1:52:11] surrender. Lay it down before the men.
[1:52:16] Lord, I give my heart
[1:52:18] [singing and music] to you.
[1:52:24] Love that saw before I knew you
[1:52:27] [music and singing]
[1:52:31] has brought me near [singing] to where
[1:52:33] you are.
[1:52:35] [music]

[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Now I live to praise you
[1:53:27] ever may I praise [singing] you.
[1:53:31] Healer of my [music]
[1:53:34] heart.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Stay here, girls.
[1:53:40] You can stay here.
[1:53:43] last week, you know, Brother Steve, he
[1:53:48] mentioned that he didn't have a dad.
[1:53:52] And then the Lord showed him that no, he
[1:53:55] did. He had a mentor all these lives and
[1:53:57] he was listening to these sermons.
[1:54:00] Well, I had a good dad that loved me
[1:54:03] very much, but I have the same mentor
[1:54:06] that Steve had. And one of the things
[1:54:10] that he struggled with the most, and
[1:54:14] it's the same thing that the Lord Jesus
[1:54:16] struggled with,
[1:54:18] was that person that
[1:54:22] they won't admit
[1:54:26] that there's something that they need in
[1:54:28] their life. They think, "I have it.
[1:54:32] I I want to see other people come to the
[1:54:34] altar. I want to see other people give
[1:54:36] their heart to the Lord, but I'm okay.
[1:54:40] And that's the spirit that is hardest to
[1:54:42] deal with.
[1:54:44] I was this past week,
[1:54:47] we tore out all the concrete in the back
[1:54:50] and and u we're getting ready to pour
[1:54:54] new concrete and there's all these piles
[1:54:55] of rubble
[1:54:57] in the concrete mason. It's one of the
[1:55:00] finest Christians I think that I've ever
[1:55:02] met.
[1:55:04] as a [music] sweet family.
[1:55:07] And I I got here and
[1:55:10] he was standing there and he was looking
[1:55:12] at the
[1:55:14] the pieces of concrete there on the
[1:55:16] ground. And and I walked up to him and
[1:55:20] and he looked back at me and he says he
[1:55:23] says, "Hey, [music] pastor." He says,
[1:55:24] "Um, Hispanic," he's a Hispanic brother.
[1:55:27] And he said, he said, "You see all this
[1:55:31] these pieces on the ground?"
[1:55:35] He said, "That's me."
[1:55:38] And he said, "God has to tear me down.
[1:55:42] He has to break me up." And then he
[1:55:45] says, "And then he rebuilds me."
[1:55:48] And he says, "We're going to rebuild all
[1:55:50] of this, pastor, and it's going to look
[1:55:52] really good." He says, "But this all
[1:55:54] this concrete here," he says, "that's
[1:55:56] me."
[1:55:57] He says, "I thank God
[1:56:00] that he would tear me down like he's
[1:56:02] done." And I thank God that he can
[1:56:05] rebuild me up. And I said I said,
[1:56:07] "Brother, you're you're right. And and I
[1:56:10] feel like he does it to me every day.
[1:56:11] And if I would just let him [music] tear
[1:56:13] me down,
[1:56:15] if I would just let these pe pieces just
[1:56:17] be broken and fall down and and and say,
[1:56:20] "Now, Lord, now it's just a big pile.
[1:56:22] Now, Lord, would you just put it all
[1:56:24] back together and would you make it
[1:56:25] better than it was before?"
[1:56:28] That's a true Christian, friends.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Sisters, can you sing it again?
[1:56:45] You are the [music and singing] healer,
[1:56:52] the healer of my [singing and music]
[1:56:55] heart. Amen.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; The maker [singing and music]
[1:57:00] and the God of all we are.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:57:13] [music]
[1:57:14] I was the [singing] broken
[1:57:20] [music]
[1:57:22] vessel [singing] in your hand.
[1:57:26] [music]
[1:57:28] You looked beyond the hurt and [singing]
[1:57:31] made me whole again. [music]
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Oh dear God, we thank you.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Healer of the broken.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; We thank you, oh God.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; You touched my [singing] heart and made
[1:57:49] it new.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Now my whole life I surrender. Lay it
[1:57:58] down before the men. [music and singing]
[1:58:01] Lord, I give my heart to you.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Love that saw before I knew you
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; has brought me near. [music and singing]
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; has brought me near to where you are.
[1:58:20] [music]
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Now I live [singing] to praise [music]
[1:58:26] you
[1:58:28] ever. May I praise you,
[1:58:31] healer of my [singing and music]
[1:58:33] heart.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Nothing [singing] compares Lord
[1:58:49] to [music]
[1:58:50] knowing
[1:58:52] you.
[1:58:56] Go and [music and singing] see what the
[1:58:58] grace of God can do.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; You faithfully serve me
[1:59:15] [singing]
[1:59:18] and call me your own.
[1:59:22] [singing]
[1:59:24] Then made a [music] way to bring my
[1:59:27] [singing] wondering heart back home.
[1:59:31] Let's just sing it now. Just sing it,
[1:59:34] friends.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand, friends. Stand and let
[1:59:41] it rebuild you.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; You touched my heart [music and singing]
[1:59:44] and made it.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Now my whole life I surrender. [singing]
[1:59:54] Lay down before the men. Lord, I give my
[2:00:00] heart to [singing and music] you.
[2:00:05] Love [singing] that's all before I knew
[2:00:08] [music] you
[2:00:10] brought me near brought [singing] me
[2:00:13] near to where you are.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Now I live to praise you
[2:00:24] ever may I praise [singing] you.
[2:00:28] Healer of my [music]
[2:00:30] heart.
[2:00:32] [singing]
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Bow our heads, [music] friends.
[2:00:48] And the sweet spirit that's here.
[2:00:56] There's a time
[2:00:58] to be broken down and then there's a
[2:01:00] time to rebuild.
[2:01:06] Allow him, friends. Allow yourself to
[2:01:10] surrender to the Lord Jesus.
[2:01:15] Allow yourself to be seen as a broken
[2:01:17] person before him.
[2:01:21] saying, "Now, Lord, would you take
[2:01:25] these [music] pieces as maybe the the
[2:01:28] potter had broken them and he brought he
[2:01:30] brought them back together
[2:01:32] and this [music] concrete was broken up
[2:01:35] and then Lord, you poured a fresh new
[2:01:38] piece there. [music]
[2:01:41] Allow him, friends, to to change you.
[2:01:45] Let that heart that may have been once
[2:01:49] stony, let it be broken and be soft and
[2:01:52] tender now.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Allow the Holy Spirit [music] to correct
[2:01:59] and to nurture and to
[2:02:03] teach us.
[2:02:05] Lord God,
[2:02:08] we thank you father for this testimony
[2:02:11] and how Lord you have been a father to
[2:02:14] so many of us
[2:02:18] and Lord many of us
[2:02:20] had earthly fathers and many of us
[2:02:23] didn't
[2:02:25] but there was always a father there that
[2:02:28] was looking after us and taking care of
[2:02:31] us and oh God we're thankful for for
[2:02:35] that father that was there from the time
[2:02:38] we were born until this time now.
[2:02:42] And Lord,
[2:02:45] we pray that you would build build us
[2:02:47] back up, Father.
[2:02:50] May we be [music] better person, a
[2:02:52] better Christian, a better believer as
[2:02:54] we leave this place,
[2:02:58] Lord, that we might that our lives
[2:03:00] wouldn't be wasted, Father, wasted on
[2:03:03] ourselves or on chasing something else,
[2:03:05] but our lives would be used by you to
[2:03:08] win souls to you and to build you up. Oh
[2:03:11] God,
[2:03:14] you said if you would be lifted up that
[2:03:16] you would draw all men to you. Lord, let
[2:03:18] us lift you up. Let us point to that
[2:03:21] cross
[2:03:24] and say, "My friend,
[2:03:28] you may be broken. You may be hurting,
[2:03:31] but I came to that cross
[2:03:34] and it built me back up and it can do
[2:03:36] the same to you,
[2:03:39] Lord.
[2:03:41] We thank you,
[2:03:44] Father. We pray that,
[2:03:48] Lord, that we could just find your will,
[2:03:51] Lord. That we could just walk in the
[2:03:54] light of the gospel all the time, Lord.
[2:03:58] And Father, each day, day by day, Lord,
[2:04:00] tear us down and rebuild us, Father. Let
[2:04:03] there be no Daniel Evans even anywhere
[2:04:06] near me. I pray that it would all be
[2:04:08] Jesus Christ. Oh dear God, that Christ
[2:04:12] would just flow from me and Lord that it
[2:04:15] would flow from each person in this
[2:04:17] audience and father that it would flow
[2:04:19] out into others and it would just spread
[2:04:21] and deeper and deeper until Father that
[2:04:24] the whole world would just Lord be at
[2:04:27] least ex
[2:04:30] introduced to it. Then I believe that
[2:04:33] you would come
[2:04:35] for Lord
[2:04:37] the book closes
[2:04:40] with the bride crying out in the spirit
[2:04:43] Lord come.
[2:04:46] Father we pray that while you were Terry
[2:04:49] that we could be a witness.
[2:04:53] Lord that you'd be with us all. May your
[2:04:56] will be done. And then Lord, as we go,
[2:05:02] this meal that's been provided, Lord, we
[2:05:04] pray that you would bless the hands that
[2:05:06] provided it. Those that work so hard so
[2:05:09] that we might enjoy fellowship and a
[2:05:11] meal tonight. Bless them, Father, many
[2:05:13] times over from the blessings that
[2:05:15] they've given us. We pray. [music]
[2:05:17] And Lord, we pray that the Holy Spirit
[2:05:21] would be with us as we fellowship and
[2:05:23] that the food would be sanctified
[2:05:26] in Jesus' name. And Father, for your
[2:05:29] glory, we pray. Amen.

[2:06:53] of

[2:06:57] and the forgiveness
