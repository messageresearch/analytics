when the saints go marching i am waiting for their chairs [Music] [Applause] when the saints go marching oh when the saints go marching in oh when the saints go marching in [Music] how many of us already got their ticket stamped and they know they're in that number amen you may be seated for a few moments here we do have prayer requests and some things to bring to your attention and i'd like to share a testimony it it's it's how mindful god is and it's there are no surprises with god he's not oh my i wasn't prepared for that you know he takes care of things but sister amelia has asked us to keep her in prayer as for an urgent need that she has also she's going to the dentist to have a tooth removed so just remember that and she shared the need for some work they're going to be doing in their home and she has to find a place for a few days but i know god will supply that need while they take care of that because he says i own the cattle on a thousand hills got a call this afternoon and it's amazing how god allows things to work out i was sitting in the there in front of the office resting a little bit and kind of dozing off and i thought i left the church door unlocked because usually my girls come in after and i got a call saying would you please open the door dad so i went out to open it but it got me wide awake for the phone call that was coming next and sister tony cruz called me or asked sent me a text asked me to call her and she hasn't been able to be here with us and brother tim her son is here and he had put in a praise last wednesday about how she was being able to eat some more and her back was feeling better but she called me and she said she was having a lot of trouble standing and not being able to move and she had some tests done and they drew blood and they found cancer in her blood and it has gotten onto her bones now so the doctor said that she shouldn't be walking around because her bones could break and so she shared some things and and all in i just failed to ask her how how are you with god right now that's the most important thing god could hear you make you well but let's let's make sure our hearts are right before the lord so we able to share some things i didn't know she was a retired nurse she lost her husband um or i knew she i believe your father passed away is that right tim or was there separation okay but she said told me she said i did not want to live on welfare so i went back to school and i got my nurses degree at 45 years old i said i'm retired for that she said so i understand the medical portion of it but i said but we've got a god who's the healer and we're able to pray and and two people came on my heart to possibly could go help her sister heather and sister shirley moore and they're the first two people that walked in they came in and i said just the two people that god put him a heart to talk to and they walk in for the possibility of maybe being able to go and be with her god does things he's already got it laid out god had already planned i believe that tony's sister tony loves the lord jesus and i know he loves her and her desire she said i i don't want to go now i have a of my dad and my brother said older i'd like to live to see them and i believe that's a good request something in her heart but she said i'll make sure everything is right and i'll be ready to go if he calls me home and that's the assurance we have so let's keep our sister in prayer also i failed to call brother david zavala there in san diego because tomorrow is the memorial service and then tuesday is a burial for our brother lucero and brother lucero was a um how do i say just an integral part of the church he's such a fine brother and he had just remarried probably in his 70s and had just remarried and he passed away with cobin and brother david told me the church was having a hard time with that because he was such a part it's a small church but i said how are you doing he said well brother newton called me and asked me if it was okay if he came so he came and covered service for us today it's going to help us tomorrow so god already made that provision too so i know that god is mindful sometimes we say lord help thou my unbelief and so let's remember them in prayer and but i'd like to read you something as you know and and i don't know how many of you folks here knew brother tom earnest uh some of you may be to raise your hand um he he attended the tabernacle years ago he worked for brother joe greene and he came administered to us one service right before nina and stephen got married and he got sick with kovid he was associate minister for brother jim but let me read what happened before he passed away um nina sent it to us just to let her know says i wanted to share with you with you guys last night stephen and i went to visit sister sandy and that's brother tom's wife and their family that's brother tom's family that passed that had passed away i was amazed how strong they are in the lord because in a time like this it is only the strength of the lord if the lord gives it it can carry you they really shared testimonies of how the lord was preparing them for his death without them knowing it says so the day before brother tommy passed away i believe jessica which is his oldest daughter just felt to go to the hospital and call the doctors and tell them i am down in the parking lot and just letting you know if you need to have some questions or have some questions for us and you want us to come and talk to you about the decisions about the ventilator and so on we're in the parking lot and stephanie who is the other sister said she felt really strongly that day just to stay near the hospital and she hadn't told any of the family that she had felt strongly so she just kind of stayed near the hospital drove around and she got a call from her sister said they that they felt strongly to go to the hospital if you want to come and hang out with us we might just be in the parking lot so this was the two sisters getting the same so she was like i feel the same i'm around the corner so she went and jessica called and then told her they have to go ahead and to come up which is not what not they're letting not people do but the doctors told him to come on in he says no one is allowed near the patients and so on so they let sister sandy the moms jessica and sephie go up and they asked if josh your brother could go expecting to know but the nurse said yes he can come also he said so they all went in with the intent of answering questions and helping the nurses convince brother tommy to get on the ventilator because that is what the doctors thought would be best anyway when the decisions were made they were able to see for the tommy for a good time and talk with him which a lot of families are not being able to drink and the banana the next day brother tommy passed away now you'll get this impression this feeling i need to go do this and it tell your sister and your mom and all and they were all able to go spend the day before with brother tommy but god is still in charge god is still mindful sometimes he gets hard no question about it but we serve a living god do you have a need you have a request maybe you'd raise your hand and say lord lord i need you right now brother dan evans would you come up and if we'll stand let's just sing that part of lord i believe and let's testify [Music] lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe [Music] lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible [Music] let's pray our great heavenly father how we approach you lord knowing that throughout the ages that you've always been there to answer the prayers of your people father we humbly bow our heads and bow our hearts before you tonight lord if if you would be standing here at this pulpit how we would like to come and lay our our bodies down at the altar before you and just lord thank you for giving yourself for us lay these requests before you father that these requests that our brother aaroness told us lord as a body of christians we bring them before you in the name of your son jesus christ knowing that it is written in your word that ask anything in my name and i will do it father we ask it in your name that we would hear of testimonies and miracles that would come from this night and these prayers that we put before you lord as as we approach you we we bring these requests before you as your espoused bride and lord knowing that you're able to do it bless brother lyle tonight as he ministers and father speak to each one of us tonight that we could go from here knowing as the disciples as they walked on the road to emmaus they could say as our hearts burned within us as you talked with us along the way lord let us be able to say the same tonight we ask these things in the name above all names jesus christ amen [Music] amen isn't isn't he wonderful the way he does things jesus jesus [Music] there's just something about that day [Music] master savior jesus like the fragrance after the rain jesus jesus [Music] and earth proclaim kings and kingdom shall all pass away but there's something about that name [Music] you may be seated thank you my heavenly home is bright and fair and i feel like traveling on you know sometimes we get maybe a little uh we lock ourselves up at home and we don't want to go out sometimes it's just safety in the comfort of home well i got a draw that's pulling me and i'm wanting to go home oh my heavenly home is [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes i feel like [Music] is [Music] the sun out shines oh i feel like traveling on heavenly mansion shall be mine i feel like traveling on yes i feel like traveling [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] but i feel like yes i feel like [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] travelling yes i feel like traveling on [Music] sometimes when you're traveling you just want to get home but when you're not there yet you want to get on the home so we're not quite home yet but we're almost there [Music] you want to sing that song you're saying as a special the one that he cares i think you're saying it the last time you stand for us i just she always said i could call on her and then today naomi what's the name of the song the collins worth song that you're saying and i just know naomi said when she sang it she had just wanted that song so much that day and now i'm asking we're all lost i can trust jesus would you do that i guess i put her in a spot she doesn't have much choice now does she she could say no but i can't trust jesus it it it's it's an assurance when you know you can ask and he says i've got it under control so thank you [Music] he brushed off its woods and then watched it soar into the sky if he's mindful of creation on this i can depend [Music] i am his and i can place all my trust in him [Music] i can trust jesus [Music] he is strengthening i can trust jesus he takes care of me [Music] i have prayed some prayers and felt they never heard but i held to god's hand and kept pride on trusting in his words my wants and god's desires don't always agree but i lean on his will for he always knows what's best for me sing with me i can trust jesus i can't trust jesus [Music] he never once has he is [Music] is [Music] i can trust [Music] he is my son i can trust jesus [Music] i can trust you [Music] is [Music] you can trust him he's never failed amen thank you sister martha it's the privilege of the song leader i guess but also she has always said you can call on me so and you know the body enjoys one another everyone has a part to do everyone has a part to play every even if it's just raising your hand tears running down and the joy to see the moving of the lord over the people it's a wonderful thing to see and appreciate the grace of god in our lives as a brother lyle comes tonight god knows what we have need of and how to deliver it and so we'll just trust in that so amen just amazing grace how many knows it is grace if if if not then it would be nothing but a competition who did better who did best but jesus paid it all and all to him amazing [Music] like [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm found was blind but now i see twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears [Music] how precious did that grace appear the hour i first believed praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] thank you good evening it's so good to be back back in that leaky trailer with no hot water and a malfunctioning toilet driving back to the desert in a car with no air conditioning because some rodents found the wires to be a little too tasty not so much but back in fellowship with you my brothers and sisters my family in christ that's why it's good to be back as many of you know we left town on july 28th to attend the funeral and help comfort the family of brother allen hopkinson in dallas texas he passed away unexpectedly that morning suddenly but peacefully he was laid to rest on monday morning august the second allen was a world war ii veteran just a few weeks shy of his 97th birthday afterwards heather and i decided we needed a break so we headed out to colorado planned to do some national parks and just get away but who's in charge us as we try to plan and exercise control over our lives or our lord who's slaves we are you know the answer thus we find ourselves back in tucson in august and not cooling off in some national park because in the end we are his we must yield to his control we can do it the easy way or the not-so-easy way but if we're his we must do it let's join our hearts together in prayer one more time lord jesus we're so grateful for this opportunity that we can be together that we can gather around your word that we can worship you lord in spirit and in truth accept our worship except our praise because in the end it's all about you lord lord jesus i pray that you'd help me to step out of the way forgive me where i've fallen short attitudes words actions thoughts lord that your people are here tonight lord desiring to hear from you to draw from you to receive from you and lord i just pray that you'd help me to be a channel for your honor and for your glory this evening we commit the remainder of this service into your hands and we thank you in jesus precious name see if i can remember how to use this our opening verses for this evening are found in ephesians the second chapter ephesians 2 verses 8 and 9. for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it's a gift of god not of works you can't earn it lest any man should boast please be seated i was going to use these verses for a very different sermon but who's in charge tonight let's go on a brief journey to israel and to egypt the purpose of the journey to see the hand of the lord expressing his grace and his love to realize that he's at work in the background when he seems invisible and silent when it seems that he's not answering your prayer that it seems like you're not getting through and in spite of appearances to the contrary he really is in charge no matter what struggles you or i might be enduring how well we've convinced ourselves that we've stepped over the line from which there is no return his grace is sufficient not sure i'm going to give you a test i'm going to give you a word test it's an easy one it's a true or false if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness true or false in fact not only can he cleanse us from all unrighteousness he can even cleanse us from self-righteousness as brother peter spoke about last sunday evening if we're under the covering of the blood of jesus christ god doesn't see us our sin our unrighteousness we're identified with our sacrifice which is jesus if we accept him as our savior and as our lord and that's the only is acceptable to god he inhabited human flesh he inhabited human flesh to offer himself for us so he could restore the fellowship lost in eden as we just read in ephesians it's by grace unmerited favor undeserving through faith which itself is a gift nothing we can do you can't work it up there's no earning it i think one of the books of the bible that is all about grace and goes into great length demonstrating god's grace and mercy is my favorite old testament book genesis much of genesis is about the family of abraham's grandson jacob it's actually visible now i almost need sunglasses here here's a chart showing the children of jacob and who birthed each one jacob had two wives leia and rachel he also lived with two other women zilpah and bilhah which were slaves of his wives it's important to understand that leia was his first wife she was given to him by a deception of her father a week later he was given rachel as the second wife and the woman he thought he was marrying all along initially rachel couldn't have children so she encouraged jacob to have children by her slave bilhah thus bill haas closely associated with rachel leia followed the same path if she can do it i can do it and encourage jacob to have children by her slave zilpah leia and bilhah play significant roles in our message this evening the final 14 of the 50 chapters of genesis center around joseph jacob's 11th son and the elder of the two children by his favorite wife rachel the other child being benjamin in fact joseph's name appears some 157 times in 138 different verses in the book of genesis judah's name is next it only appears 28 times in 26 verses yet the messiah is the lion of the tribe the line of judah not joseph benjamin the 12th son appears 17 times in 16 verses and then we come to reuben he's the firstborn thus the holder of the birthright or the right of the firstborn he's the son of leia his name occurs the fourth most often but it's only 13 times in 13 verses tonight let's focus a bit on reuben and the crucial role that he plays in this story now brother branham mentions reuben 50 times in the messages we have almost always it's in conjunction with either 144 000 being saved at the end time or illustrating jesus as being the alpha and omega beginning and end reuben and benjamin jasper and sardis donate the priestly breastplate when we think of birthright and jacob's involved we think of jacob and esau jacob was able to get esau to upsell him his birthright for a bowl of stew apparently isaac was powerless to restore it rebecca later connived with jacob to trick isaac into giving jacob the blessing intended on and to giving jacob with the blessing intended for esau again isaac was unable to reverse it yet we also see that jacob was able to take the birthright from reuben and give it to joseph skipping over nine of his brothers who by birth order were more entitled to it than joseph it's a very curious thing so i wanted to cut down reuben and ask him reuben hey what's up with all this i couldn't and of course neither can you but what we can do is we can turn to the bible and see what it tells us and we often need to read between the lines to get the bigger picture referring to what we call the old testament paul tells us in ii timothy all scripture is given by inspiration of god as profitable for doctrine reproof correction instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works tonight i'd like to focus on forgiveness rescue and god's timing and something else too some of the story contains what we often call these days adult material but i'll tone it down for the sake of the children among us we can identify at some level with the family of jacob in their monumental struggles because we all struggle we're all at war with our flesh with our nature which we're told is an enmity actively working against god none of us think ourselves worthy of god's love or grace and we aren't but he's bigger than we are and his love transcends our frailty after all he made us the way he made us to serve his purposes paul's very first writings tell us the book of galatians be not deceived god's not mocked whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap he that soweth to his flesh of the flesh reap corruption he that so should the spiritual of the spirit reap life everlasting so make no mistake we pay for our self will our fleshly indulgences our disobedience but we pay a price that's intended to correct and guide and teach us not a price of revenge or cruelty god gets no joy in punishing or destroying us he's not a sadist he's our father he gets joy watching us grow and mature moving from milk to meat from being taught to teaching from being helped to helping moving from the classroom to the field from the academy to the battle moving from defeat to victory from hesitation to confidence i've titled tonight's lesson reuben to the rescue you can actually see it we're going to be jumping back and forth in time perhaps a total of 40 years and places canaan and egypt this map will help plant those locations in your mind we we see canaan is separated from egypt by the sinai desert dothan a small town in canaan in the upper right is marked with the bold green arrow this is where joseph is sold to an ishmaelite spice cavern bound for egypt memphis an early capital city of egypt is marked with a blue arrow there this is near where joseph was sold into slavery and the area of egypt from which he eventually ruled it's where his brothers will come to buy grain from him during the famine now the distance between these two locations is about 300 miles that's about the distance from tucson to el paso or tucson to kingman goshen where jacob's family will eventually settle and be enslaved is marked with a purple arrow it's north of memphis in the nile delta region even today this is very fertile and productive farmland well where to start let's go to the last words of jacob his dying words to his son this speech takes place in goshen genesis 49 reuben he's 137 years old so he has a little trouble projecting his voice here reuben thou art my firstborn my might the beginning of my strength i'm sure he's looking at reuben right in the eyes as he's saying this the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power but unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed then thou defiled us did he went up to my couch jacob reminds reuben of a grievous sin that he had committed against his father it cost him his birthright that birthright was apparently never restored to him it seems jacob never forgave reuben brother branham said that unstable as water indicated reuben was weak unstable other translations used the word turbulent also suggests he was passionate acting without thinking things through one tradition and it may be just that a tradition asserts that after rachel's death jacob promoted bilhah to be the one who slept in his tent it's certainly consistent with what jacob is saying here if we go back further back when they were in bananaran we recall from genesis 30 that is a little boy reuben found some mandrake in a field and brought it mommy look what i found gave it to leia rachel wanted it give me that leia swapped the mandrake for a night with her own husband it seems clear that jacob and rachel were together while leia was treated like bilhah and zilpah a concubine a slave not as his wife she was used and unloved the tradition further states that jacob promoted bilhah rachel's handmaid to his tent after rachel's death while giving birth to benjamin remember the violation occurred on jacob's bed perhaps bilhah reminded him of rachel regardless this arrangement would have been an utter humiliation to leia reuben's act and violating bilhah resulted in jacob dismissing her jacob would then move leia to his tent this is tradition but reuben it seems by this foolish and sinful act not only rescued his mother leia from shame and degradation at the hand of jacob but ultimately rescued jacob from his attitude toward leia in contrast with rachel as we'll see in a moment did this event define reuben does it illustrate his character was he just an immoral person taking advantage of his deceased stepmother's slave an angry young man reacting to his mother's humiliation whether this was planned by reuben or conspiracy involving lay in reuben or just an impulsive and thoughtless act we don't know jacob tells us reuben is impetuous unstable turbulent unruly what we do know is that eventually jacob came to love leia his dying words and his final wish are recorded for us and jacob charged his sons and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field to ephron the hittite in the cave that is in the field of mach pella which is before mom ray and the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field of ephron they hit type 4 a possession of a burying place there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebecca his wife and there i buried leia what a change in heart he buried leia his previously unloved wife in the most hallowed and honored place he put her body in the family tomb with abraham and sarah with his parents isaac and rebecca he didn't move rachel's bones to that tomb she was laid to rest near bethlehem and jacob wanted to be buried next to leia what about reuben what happens to him after this sordid episode dan and naphtali must have really hated him he raped their mother see this relationship circled and read on the screen we just read that jacob didn't forgive reuben but what punishment might have been exacted on reuben when their sister dinah was defiled simeon and levi murdered all the men of the entire town when his daughter-in-law tamar was found to be pregnant long after the death of her husband judah was about to burn her alive reuben's life might well have been taken for his act ruben's brothers are not gentle people they're passionate angry sometimes violent men they're part of an extremely dysfunctional family yet they're the patriarchs the part of the chosen are we part of his chosen what does that mean paul puts us in our place first corinthians 1. god hath chosen the foolish things of the world god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to naught things that are why that no flesh should glory in his presence in other words the chosen or not picked because they're exceptional were quite ordinary and quite often looked down upon so much for bride pride back to reuben we see the consequences of his act could have cost him his life two of his brothers would hate him for violating their mother another two of his brothers are cruel violent men as we'll soon see regardless of reuben's motives jacob stripped him of his authority and rights as the firstborn and transferred them not to simeon the second born the one who would have normally received it consider the example of isaac as the second border of jacob himself but to joseph joseph the 11th born back to canaan 40 years before jacob's death joseph is 17. we're told now israel that's jacob's other name loved joseph more than all his children because he was a son of his old age jacob was 90 or 91 when joseph was born he's about 107 at this point benjamin was much younger so son here implies more than biological relationship think of adoption well let me turn this off and turn this on okay so he made a coat he made him a coat of many colors can you hear me okay with this mike okay i don't know if that's good or if that's too bad but there you go and when his brethren saw or understood or realized that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him they could not give him shalom this garment signified authority we have to be careful how we read when it says his brethren because if it means all of his brothers it has to include benjamin and benjamin's a toddler at this point it's unlikely that he hated his big brother joseph as we'll see it's also unlikely that reuben hated him even though he may have had the most reason because of the code of authority and the birthright so his brethren means some many most but not necessarily all keeping in mind the title of tonight's message reuben to the rescue let's look next at joseph's dreams and the next verse dream number one joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brothers and they hated him yet the more he said unto them listen up guys listen about this dream i dreamed behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheave arose above yours and and and it stood upright and behold your sheaves stood around mine and and made obeisance to my sheaf his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words now we have this 17 year old boy who's just been given serious recognition by his dad at the expense of his siblings there's no indication he should have shared the dream but he does there's no indication the dream is from god he says i dreamed a dream note that jacob who must have heard about it doesn't record it as objecting to this dream maybe he thought it lent a little bit of authority or or recognition or justification to his elevation of joseph we notice the dream is about them bowing down making obeisance to him the recent recipient of that code of authority does it seem a little odd that the dream is about wheat and these guys are shepherds not farmers it seems joseph attitude when he shares it may have been prideful or condescending because we're told they hate him not only for the dream but for his words those that hate him hate him more joseph has a few lessons to learn let's continue on to dream number two in the next verse and he dreamed yet another dream and told that his brethren i'm sorry i tend to wander back and forth here and said behold i dreamed another dream behold the sun and moon and eleven stars made obedience to me and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father jacob rebuked him and said what is this dream thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come down to bow ourselves to thee to the earth his brothers envied him but his father observed the saying niv says kept the matter in mind the nlt said wondered what the dreams meant he dreams and again seems compelled to share it it's similar only in that joseph is exalted and those around him must bow down no wheat no setting this time but in this dream rather than a vague observation that his brother's wheat cheese bowed down to his we have the detail that all 11 brothers are included this time it includes his father and mother which was to must have met one of his stepmothers because his mom had passed away i think reuben was comforted by this dream what how can that be brother lyle remember reuben sinned against his father and his stepmom he could have been killed who knows in the next chapter of genesis judah is about to burn tomorrow live for a similar sin but in this dream it says that all 11 of his brothers are included for reuben that means his life is spared regarding this sin he's not going to be killed or or excommunicated or shunned or driven away or made an outcast because if that were the case he couldn't participate with his brothers in this so genesis is all about this and what is this grace and marriage and favor and notice something else here hatred has been overshadowed by what envy envy why would they suddenly envy the one they hated let's jump forward 22 years and move 300 miles from jacob's tent to pharaoh's palace senior threat too the pharaoh has had a pair of dreams he's disturbed by them the court dream interpreters can't tell them what it means you may recall we went into this in some detail last year genesis 41 25 joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god has shown pharaoh what he is about to do the the seven good cows are seven years and the seven good years or seven years the dream is won the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he shows to pharaoh behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land and to plenty shall not be known by the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous well what do we have here that's like joseph's dreams the subject plenty followed by famine no what is parallel is that joseph had two different dreams about the same topic his family bowing down to him and pharaoh had two different dreams about the same topic so years of plenty followed by years of famine well so what why is that significant why would that make the brothers jealous envious of joseph well let's listen because in the next verse joseph explains why to pharaoh and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass so in canaan in joseph's time at least within his family a dream repeated was accepted to mean that a it's from god and be it will soon be fulfilled so the brothers are envious because not only do they hate joseph but they now believe that this is really going to happen they're going to have to bow down to him they'd rather that he bowed down to them they're envious back to jacob and the family back in canaan 22 years earlier this is this is back to genesis 37. so joseph's brethren went to feed their father's flock remember their shepherds not wheat farmers and sheckle and israel jacob said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock and sheck them come i will send the unto them and joseph said to them said to him here am i and and jacob said to joseph go i pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so jacob sent them out of the valley of hebron and joseph came to shechem why would jacob be worried about them they're pretty strong able-bodied young men is it just his nature or did he have a reason we read in genesis 34 some months to know more than a couple of years earlier that jacob's daughter dinah went to visit the young women in the town of shechem this was near jacob's camp at that time shechem the son of hamor who ruled the town also the name of the town can be a little confusing here defiled dinah hamor tried to make amends and we read in genesis 34 the sons of jacob answered shechem and hemorrha's father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dana their sister they said unto him we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us but in this will we consent unto you if you will be as we be that every male of you be circumcised they're going to use a sign that god gave abraham as a weapon we aren't told which of jacob's sons said this but they had a great teacher and their father on the subject of deception the men of the town agree and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinah's brethren all three are children of leia each man took his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew killed all the men and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechem's house and went out the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister they took their sheep their oxen their asses that which was in the city and that which was in the field and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and spoiled even all that was in the house jacob has a reason to worry what reuben did pales in comparison to what simeon levi and others of sons have done so he sends joseph wearing that code of authority to find out if they're okay young 17 year old hated by his brothers that joseph turns out the brothers had moved on from shechem to dothan a stranger at shechem informed joseph of this and joseph found him there and when they saw joseph afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against joseph to slay him they said one to another behold this dreamer's coming come now and therefore let's kill him cast him into some pit and we'll say some evil beast has devoured him we'll see what will become of his dreams and now we have reuben coming to the rescue reuben heard of it and he delivered him joseph out of their hands and said let us not kill joseph reuben said to them shed no blood but cast him into this pit so the wilderness lay no hand upon him he said that reuben might rid joseph out of their hands and deliver joseph to jacob again the brothers are plotting here reuben persuades them not to kill joseph outright but to cast him into an empty cistern a stone pit he plans to rescue joseph from the pit and return him to jacob reuben to the rescue but he then steps out of the story for a short time and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stripped joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it so part one of reuben's attempted rescue has succeeded joseph isn't killed he's imprisoned the terms used here imply violence they weren't gentle with joseph oh joe take off your coat or let me hang it up for you please step down into this uh pit here uh yeah it's a little hot it's a little dry but you know everything's okay no no they weren't gentle later in the story in egypt there's a flashback that tells us that it was in fact violent well let's flash forward to that conversation in egypt genesis 42 and joseph's brothers said one to another we are verily guilty concerning joseph and that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us he begged us we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us it it seems likely that joseph was in that cistern for three days but first as a type of christ we're told that joseph was a perfect type of christ he was crucified buried in a stone tomb and rose on the third day and second because joseph later throws his brothers into a pit a prison in egypt for three days if we move back a few verses still in chapter 42 we see that joseph recognizes his brothers recalls the dreams he had when he was 17 and contemplates what he will do with or to them joseph said unto them that is that i spake unto you saying your spies hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh you shall not go forth from here except your youngest brother come here send one of you let him fetch your brother you'll be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely you are spies and he put them all together into ward for three days this is a very dangerous place not only for the brothers who are now in fear for their lives what's the penalty for being a spy even today death but for joseph joseph seems here to be bent on a path of revenge he swears not one but two oaths by the only one greater in egypt than himself pharaoh he puts him in the dungeon he's contrived an accusation of spying to put them in mortal fear we usually think of joseph as a larger than life nearly perfect person perfect type of christ comes to mind jesus never sought revenge so we assume joseph never did either but joseph is capable of such thoughts and actions he's as human as we are he'd been wounded deeply he'd suffered for many years as a result of his brother's hatred and envy and after some 22 years he now has a chance to pay them back and he's taking the first steps of doing just that we'll return to this scene a little bit later but back to genesis 37 when and kanan and joseph is 17 we see the brothers are so very callous joseph is in a pit fearing for his life beaten bruised hungry but no food hot and thirsty but no water we're told the cistern is both empty and without water it has to be hot because the sister will only be in that case in the very late part of summer maybe september or so meanwhile his brothers his tormentors they sat down to eat bread they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmaelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spices and bomb and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt and judah said to his brethren come now therefore sorry what prophet is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood come let's sell him to the ishmaelites let not our hand be upon him he is our brother in our flesh and his brethren were content and they're passed by midianites merchantments these are ishmaelites from midian and the brothers drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt in spite of reuben's previous effort the brothers are still contemplating killing joseph then they see ishmaelites people who hate them and especially hate their grandfather isaac as having dispossessed ishmael coming the brothers decide to make joseph really suffer by selling him to their enemies who will then sell them into egypt sweet revenge for the ishmaelites a fate worse than death for joseph and they don't have to kill him there's another whole sermon in the ishmaelite midianites but that's not for tonight keep in mind that joseph didn't know of their plotting judah's influence to sell him into slavery or reuben's intervention that spared his life he only knew he was violently attacked by his brothers beaten up put into an empty cistern with no food or water after some time he's taken out of this pit and sold into slavery traveling with a band of spice not slave traders who really really hate his family really he's got a 300 mile trek to go through the desert it's a long trip they're gonna pass not far from where jacob lives but oh oh my father lives just over the hill he's a very wealthy man he'll give you so much more than you'll get from me as a slave in egypt just take me to my dad he'll reward you handsomely i know he will shut up we're taking you to egypt now reuben appears back from whatever he had to do seeking to rescue joseph but reuben returned to the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and reuben tore his clothes he returned to his brothers and said the child is not i whither shall i go reuben comes to the pit to rescue joseph joseph isn't there the nlt puts it this way sometime later reuben returned to get joseph out of the cistern when he discovered that joseph was missing he tore his clothes in grief then he went back to his brothers and lamented the boy is gone what will i do now now the remaining nine brothers realized reuben was going to betray them to their father by rescuing joseph shaky ground for reuben but there's no indication that they told reuben that they sold joseph they let him think he was killed maybe simeon kept the two shekels that would have been rubens for the share of the sale of joseph to the traders right firstborn gets double portion he might as well get the double portion why tell reuben about this they took joseph's coat killed a kid of the goats that the coat and the blood and they sent the coat of many colors they brought it to their father and said oh we found this do you know it was this joseph they're all in on the deception of the deceiver meanwhile the last verse in chapter 37 the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaohs captain of the guard reuben's attempt to save joseph's life succeeded but his attempt to rescue and restore him to jacob has failed but unknown to all of them unknown to joseph unknown to reuben as the fact that joseph did not need to be rescued years later when the brothers come to egypt to buy grain the first time joseph accused them of being spies and put them in prison we read that like the cistern the prison was a stone pit the penalty for being a spy is death the brothers like joseph 22 years earlier were in fear for their lives you can be sure that they were roughly treated they weren't being chaperoned to the local hilton as guests of egypt they were being treated like enemies of the state and put in a dungeon under grim circumstances well let's jump forward to that episode in egypt they'd been in prison he put them into ward for three days and joseph said unto them on the third day this dude live for for i fear god noticed what he put him in it was oaths by the life of pharaoh this and by the life of pharaoh that but now it's i fear god there's there's something happening here if you be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses so it's not send one back now it's i'm only going to keep one but bring your youngest brother unto me so that your words will be verified and you shall not die and they did so he knew they'd have to come back because he knew the famine was going to be for years they were going to starve they'd come back and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother and that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us and now reuben rescues joseph a second time reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and you would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required his blood is required means that reuben thinks he's dead they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreter and he joseph having just heard the words of reuben just understood that things were different than what he thought turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and spoke with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes and again bound him took him this these are these are not gentle terms so here's joseph he's been contemplating revenge making them suffer like he suffered abusing them like he'd been abused but upon hearing reuben's words joseph quickly leaves them he just learned that reuben thought that joseph had been killed and that reuben had intervened for joseph joseph weeps this certainly suggests he's repenting of at least reconsidering what he'd planned for them when joseph returns to them he has simeon bound simeon and levi were the cruel pair and simeon was the older of the two bound before their eyes is violent driving home joseph's power to do whatever he wants let's jump forward a few months later after the second trip to egypt to buy green joseph plants his cup and benjamin's sack of grain and uses this roost to keep benjamin with him and send the rest of his siblings back to canaan judah pleads with joseph joseph realizes his brother's heart has truly changed i hope someday we can look at how this happened but for tonight we're short of time so we'll skip to the last part of judah's speech genesis 44. now this is judah the one that said let's sell them to the slavers that'll really serve him right so judah is has intervened with joseph and said because joseph wants to keep benjamin he says and thy servant my father jacob said unto us you know that my wife rachel bear me two sons and the one joseph went out from me and i said surely joseph is torn in pieces and i saw him not sense and jacob says and if you take this benjamin also from me and miss you if you follow me shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now therefore when i come to thy servant my father this is reuben begging and pleading with joseph and benjamin be not with us seeing that jacob's life is bound up in the lad's life it shall come to pass when jacob sees that benjamin is not with us that jacob will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave here comes judah to the rescue expressing his complete change of heart the patriarch of the tribe that would produce the lion for thy servant judah became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father forever i myself not myself and my siblings i now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman a slave to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren i'll be the substitutionary sacrifice for my brothers for how shall i jew to go up to my father and the lad be not with me last pear adventure i see the evil that shall come on my father this time judah has revealed his changed heart from the one that said let's sell him and really get revenge on this person that we hate and envy to my life for his as joseph is about to keep benjamin and send the other siblings home at this revelation joseph breaks down and shows himself to his brothers not as the vizier of egypt but as their brother the next verse i'm sorry i didn't keep up with this then joseph could not refrain himself from before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph does my father yet live his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled that his presence and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that she sold me hither this is after judah's impassioned plea joseph realizes that not only is he changed his brothers have as well for god did send me before you to prepare to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earring nor harvest and god sent me before you to preserve you with posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt what an ironic twist if reuben's rescue back in dothan has succeeded they'd probably all be dead did ruben's rescue fail no and this time reuben coupled with judah did rescue joseph not from his brothers but from himself and joseph rescued all of them from starvation during a great famine there's something here that that we need to recognize joseph here repeats three times that his going to egypt was god sending him so we have to ask were joseph's brothers walking in the fear of the lord were they seeking god's will for joseph oh lord show us what we should do with your servant joseph were they consciously and sincerely trying to follow the will of god or were they fleshly spiteful freewill people motivated by hate and envy it's clear they were the latter the apostle paul helps us understand this dynamic we're all familiar with this verse we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose have you ever considered how this verse fits so perfectly with joseph's story paul also tells us in his letter to the church at philippi but i would you should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me he's in prison have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in christ are manifest to all the palace and in all other places and many of the brethren and the lord growing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife some also of good will the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds the other of love knowing that i am successful what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice and yea i will rejoice this doesn't mean that we should do bad things evil things be motivated by revenge or lust or hate or envy god will correct us if we're his and do such but the real point is that god can use the actions of free will self-indulgent wrongly motivated people to bring about his will in spite of them we might say he makes lemonade out of lemons look at the events that god used but didn't necessarily motivate or direct to get joseph to egypt and set him up to be trained how to raise wheat on potiphar's plantation how to operate within the egyptian culture and legal and government systems and on and on and on all that training we have joseph promoted by favoritism by his father in response to a wrong committed by reuben sold into slavery by jealous siblings who despised him marched to egypt by ishmaelites who hated him because of his father jacob and grandfather isaac who was still alive at that time the very one who took what they saw is rightfully theirs through ishmael isaac's older brother god was able to arrange all the details so that wickedness wickedness manifested through free will would accomplish his sovereign plan the physical through joseph the spiritual through jesus the lion of the tribe of judah consider joseph had to be sent from hebron exactly when he was to arrive in shechem exactly when he did to be directed by a stranger that he just happened to encounter while wandering in the surrounding fields the stranger having just happened to have overheard the brother's plan to go to dothan dothan which happened to be a remote place with cisterns and caves and the right setup to plot and execute a murder reuben had to persuade his brothers not to kill him and his subsequent rescue plan had to fail so that at the exact moment a caravan of spice traders headed from gilead to egypt happened to take the route through dothan at the exact time the brothers were sitting down to eat lunch while joseph was in the cistern so that this caravan could be seen and the traitors had to be ishmaelites to ensure that their hatred for isaac and jacob would dissuade them from taking a large reward from jacob for the return of his favorite son they had to get to that slave market at exactly the right day at the right time under the right circumstances in the right city in egypt 300 miles away and they had to sell them to a specific man who would happen to be in the market at that precise time and in need of a slave and the buyer had to happen to be the captain of the guard so things could eventually result in joseph being taken to pharaoh to interpret his dreams but only after several years of working in the wheat fields so he'd know exactly how to deal with the future harvest and famine joseph had to have the morocca character to resist the advantages of potiphar's wife so he could be put in the right prison at the right time to meet the right people to interpret the dreams of the butler and baker who had to offend pharaoh so that they could meet joseph though this goes on and on and on it doesn't say that god moved this person here chapter 37 of genesis god's not even mentioned he's working in the background but he's at work these are not coincidences these people were not dedicated servants of god seeking his will in their lives every day and stressing over little things no the musicians would please come god used all of these people in all of these roles in all of these places to bring about salvation and show us that even when he seems to be absent he's present and working for our benefit i will never leave you or forsake you has god called you are you his child does your my occasional or all too frequent disobedience change that relationship rest in this we know we don't guess we're not just hoping we know that all all things work together for what good for whom them that love god and are called according to whose purpose our own no his purpose be it disease death sickness pandemics economic stress doesn't matter all things like i said just pray together for a moment and sing a song of worship as brother aaron comes to close the service lord jesus we are so grateful for your word so grateful the things that we can read that took place 4 000 years ago apply to us today we can see your hand at work lord when when you're in the meanwhiles and in the backgrounds and sometimes it seems that we call we reach out and sometimes it seems that you don't hear that we know you do sometimes it seems to us that that that we just wonder where are you where are you in this where are you in that but you're there you're there because you're here because you're in our hearts lord i pray that you would accept our worship this evening i pray that things that have been said tonight might be of a benefit to some that are here lord to some that are streaming or listening in lord whatever the case may be lord we read your words from your word and pray lord that they would and know that they will not return void but they'll bring about your perfect will in each of our lives we thank you in jesus name amen um i'm thinking brother it's not the song i said but maybe he is here hallelujah he is here amen he is here holy holy i will bless his name again he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name he is here you can touch him you will never be the same he is here hallelujah he is here [Music] he is here holy holy i will bless his name again he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name he is here you can touch him you will never be the same here [Music] is [Applause] [Music] i will bless his name again [Music] hear him [Music] it takes me back to another account of a taxation and they had to go back to the city that they were born in so that jesus could be called from that city there had to be romans in that time so he could be lifted up on a tree what seemed to be cruel and hard and ugly was exactly what god used to fulfill back all the way in isaiah when he said behold the virgin shall conceive oh how could that be oh when people looked down and said no way that could not be god he would have come down as brother branham very often described they were expecting them to come out of heaven and golden stairs but god has a way to bring to pass his word and sometimes we'd say oh don't that can't be the lord but i think we could all testify god has done things in our lives that we would have never said that would have been god how many knows that how many can see that in your life how many realize it that is god he knows you by name let's stand [Music] the bible teaches us all these things were recorded for us to learn to understand to see that god has it all under control to imagine moses go deliver my people from egypt go tell that pharaoh let my people go brother branham calls him the one man army yeah we would have said oh yeah whatever moses you've been out in the sun way too long but the word of god said it would be you look at your situation you look at maybe what you're going through and you say there's no hope but god says go back to what the word of god says and stand on that and i'll bring it to pass because he never fails let's pray lord we thank you that you could take of lives of men it's just not a story in the bible but things that actually happen lord and you had them written down so that we could see that you're the same yesterday today and forever and we can look back in our own lives and see how god moved maybe through the what we thought was an oppression or a jealousy or somebody taking advantage of us and caused us to go a different direction do something differently but you already had something there waiting for us lord had we tried to figure it out try to do it we would have missed it by millions of miles but you said your word would not fail lord and we're trusting in that today lord we thank you for that lord to remind us how much you care for us lord we love you in jesus christ's name amen do you imagine remember when we spoke this morning he took an airplane and brought it down in tennessee because there was a sister that needed an elijah but he didn't tell elijah he just told elijah go walking that's all he told him but the sister said god told me he was sent him so she put herself out there and said i'll wait here until god sends him along teach me lord to wait turn out to believe amen he is here hallelujah he is here [Music] his name again he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name [Music] lord willing this wednesday night brother dan evans will be speaking for us whatever god lays in his heart and i know for the next three days he's going to be nervous thinking about it but you all be praying for him would you see what god has for us because god saw this day already and he's got something laid out for us even one word if he said peace to you today
