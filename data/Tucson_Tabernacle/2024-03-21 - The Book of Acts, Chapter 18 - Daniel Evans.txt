[16:12] again for this privilege that we have to
[16:14] come to you and Jesus precious name
[16:17] amen
[16:21] brother Jordan if you could put up that
[16:23] picture that I gave you this morning
[16:24] yeah there we go now there's two
[16:27] wonderful things in this image
[16:29] the first of course is my sweetheart
[16:32] and the second you notice in the
[16:36] baptistry there's a painting in the
[16:38] background of these mountains and these
[16:40] are those mountains this is at the
[16:42] monida border we were going up to a
[16:44] family reunion in the very northern part
[16:47] of the panhandle of Idaho this last week
[16:49] and we'd driven past this place a couple
[16:52] of times since we've been married but
[16:54] it's always been either coming in the
[16:56] wrong direction bad weather you can't
[16:57] see it and this time it was visible and
[17:00] we could see it and we wanted to get get
[17:03] a picture of it and Heather was so happy
[17:05] to be able to to finally see this I was
[17:08] happy to I'd seen it back in 1970 with
[17:10] brother Francois when we were on a trip
[17:13] but uh anyway and and and I won't tell
[17:17] you about how he had to make a huge turn
[17:19] on the free where it says authorized
[17:20] Vehicles only but but I said Heather I'm
[17:24] authorizing this turn and we went ahead
[17:26] and and we made it so anyway that's on
[17:29] the moon either border if you're ever
[17:30] headed up Interstate 15 and just as you
[17:33] approach the Border Crossing into
[17:35] Montana you'll see a sign that says
[17:37] monida one mile
[17:39] uh don't go that far just before you get
[17:42] there there's a chain up area on the
[17:43] side of the road that's where you want
[17:45] to stop and that's where you can get
[17:47] that picture and the and the mountains
[17:49] are just perfectly framed there uh
[17:51] anyway that was just a real blessing but
[17:53] we had opportunity to be with family
[17:56] have their side of the family the wear
[17:57] side and a couple of cousins that uh
[18:00] they're not Christians uh I'm not
[18:03] certain that they're anti-christian but
[18:05] they certainly don't believe in uh in
[18:08] the Lord and their dad
[18:10] uh Heather's father's brother Heather's
[18:13] Uncle he was very adamant about not
[18:16] being a Christian but his wife Gwendolyn
[18:19] she became a Christian and I know that
[18:21] she was praying for her sons two boys
[18:23] Greg and Keith and and it turned out
[18:26] that in this property that we went to uh
[18:29] to have this family reunion that the
[18:31] cabin that Heather and I were in was the
[18:33] same cabin that these two brothers were
[18:35] in her cousins that she may be seen
[18:37] twice in her life and we were way off at
[18:40] one end of the property together so we
[18:42] were able to spend some time in
[18:43] Fellowship there and and we were able to
[18:46] answer some questions in a way that was
[18:49] not offensive to them that respected
[18:51] them but still brought in the Lord Jesus
[18:53] Christ and and and and and you know we
[18:56] were invited to stop by then see them
[18:58] and so forth so I I feel like there was
[19:00] progress made if you happen to think of
[19:03] of Keith and Greg Ware Greg is a retired
[19:06] University professor in Keith is is I'm
[19:09] not sure exactly what he is except he's
[19:12] basically retired as well I think but
[19:14] but these these men and their families
[19:17] need the Lord Jesus and and and I
[19:20] believe that that we won't be complete
[19:22] without them so we need to reach out and
[19:24] embrace him if you remember them in your
[19:26] prayers we'd really really appreciate
[19:28] that
[19:29] um and uh I don't know what else to say
[19:32] except that we had a good time a good
[19:34] time in the Lord a good time renewing
[19:36] connection with family and uh and and
[19:40] that in some way we were able to uh to
[19:45] to be a witness for Jesus Christ and and
[19:48] that is always always a privilege so God
[19:52] bless you thank you for humoring me with
[19:55] uh This Isn't She Lovely
[19:58] I don't know how I could be such a lucky
[20:01] guy to be married to Heather God bless
[20:03] you
[20:08] our wives love us when we get to stand
[20:10] behind
[20:11] it's amazing
[20:13] I remember seeing sister grain somewhere
[20:15] around what sister Matisse says
[20:19] and going like this to brother Greene
[20:23] but it never stopped him
[20:27] it's the the Seven Peaks on that border
[20:30] the brother Brandon the Lord showed him
[20:31] that was his his life and all that's
[20:34] what that was there's

[24:06] all right so
[24:07] appreciate that you know this this
[24:10] morning brother Daniel speaking
[24:12] speaking of a relationship with God
[24:15] talking about
[24:17] it's not just to know him by name or an
[24:19] acquaintance from a distance
[24:21] but a relationship a fellowship that's
[24:24] true
[24:25] and as he was finishing up sitting there
[24:27] and I just had my eyes closed and
[24:29] praying felt the Lord just tell me
[24:32] it's a job where it's work something you
[24:35] do to establish the relationship
[24:39] and and I just thought well we don't
[24:40] work for this he said no but it's a
[24:42] denying of self
[24:44] and I just felt he said to me you see I
[24:47] had to go to Calvary
[24:50] I had to deny myself to go to Calgary to
[24:53] make sure this relationship was going to
[24:56] work and it is working I said to brother

[25:01] wife on Thursday I believe it was
[25:04] we we passed 44 years married

[25:15] think she's she's been a wonderful lady
[25:18] and a sister and all but it's it's a
[25:21] relationship just just because you say
[25:23] you're married doesn't start it's a

[42:09] blessed
[42:10] by our study on this book I've been
[42:15] hearing a lot of people say that you
[42:17] know I never I thought I've read the
[42:19] book of Acts I thought I understood it
[42:20] but I never really understood it I never
[42:23] understood that there was so much that
[42:25] this book was so rich
[42:27] and it is it's just
[42:29] it's so as uh the song goes so deep you
[42:35] can't get under it so high I forgot but
[42:38] you know the song I'm talking about it's
[42:40] a great song I just can't remember it
[42:44] Let's uh let's get started in this in
[42:47] this book of Acts chapter 18.
[42:50] So what had happened in chapter 17 is
[42:53] Paul had just been to this place of of
[42:58] Greek
[42:59] culture and Society with Greek gods
[43:03] everywhere lining the streets and the
[43:06] marketplaces it was this place called
[43:08] Athens
[43:09] so Paul Paul was there and and he was
[43:12] able
[43:13] to preach to these people and to bring
[43:17] it right down to the level that they
[43:20] understood as I said
[43:23] Athens was a hub
[43:25] of Greek culture and we see that
[43:29] Paul as he was walking down the
[43:31] marketplace he saw all the different
[43:33] idols and all the different temples and
[43:37] he went by this place called the Temple
[43:39] of the unknown God
[43:41] and he used that place as he went up on
[43:44] the mountain he used that place to
[43:46] preach a message to these gentile people
[43:52] and we know that we have seen now from
[43:55] our study in the book of Acts that that
[43:57] we see really three different kinds of
[44:00] people that Paul is preaching to he's
[44:03] preaching number one to the Jews in the
[44:06] synagogues these are the ones that have
[44:08] accepted the Lord Jesus and have a
[44:11] background that have been taught by
[44:13] probably the Pharisees but the Pharisees
[44:16] or the Sadducees and they have seen Paul
[44:19] has explained to them and showed them
[44:22] this Jesus Christ in the Old Testament
[44:26] in from from Genesis from Abraham all
[44:30] the way through Moses teaching and all
[44:32] the prophets Paul has been able to show
[44:35] them how Jesus fulfills all these
[44:38] prophecies so we have those Jews and
[44:40] then we have these other folks that
[44:43] the Bible says that they feared God
[44:47] so these are these Gentiles that have
[44:51] come in and accepted at least part of
[44:55] the Jewish Theology of the one God a
[44:59] monotheistic religion which is not
[45:01] normal for really anyone outside the
[45:04] Jewish people so they were able to come
[45:06] in and they had accepted this Jewish god
[45:09] but they had not yet accepted the Jewish
[45:12] way of living with all the rules and the
[45:14] regulations so we have that group and
[45:18] those two people those two types of
[45:20] people were in the synagogues and then
[45:22] we see in the Athenians we see in the
[45:25] the ones from Athens we see this other
[45:27] this whole new group of these people
[45:30] that knew absolutely nothing about God
[45:32] all they knew was idols and and and and
[45:35] idol worship and and all of these
[45:38] different Greek gods and Zeus and
[45:40] mercury and all all these different ones
[45:42] that there are thousands of them that
[45:44] they had worshiped so we see in Athens
[45:46] we see those people start to show an
[45:50] interest in this Christianity
[45:53] I appreciated what brother Lyle said
[45:55] when you came up here you said um
[45:57] that
[45:59] you asked for prayer are these were
[46:02] these family members I couldn't quite
[46:03] hear that their family members and I
[46:07] appreciated brother Lyle saying that he
[46:09] was able to answer some questions
[46:11] without being offensive
[46:14] very very wise and we see the Apostle
[46:17] Paul has he's the master of that wisdom
[46:21] to where he could bring it right down to
[46:25] where everyone he was talking to whether
[46:27] it's the Pharisee theologians
[46:30] or whether it's these Greek Jews or
[46:33] whether it's these converts or whether
[46:35] it's these completely heathen
[46:38] people he could speak to all of them
[46:42] so I see you brother Lyle maybe you were
[46:45] able to apply some of this book of Acts
[46:48] that maybe that we've been studying to
[46:50] to your wisdom and I did appreciate the
[46:53] way that you said that without being
[46:55] offensive
[46:56] we saw that Paul in Athens he quotes
[46:59] actually he's talking to these
[47:02] completely idolaters
[47:04] and he actually quotes a famous
[47:07] celebrity of the day
[47:10] and he says that that this celebrity
[47:13] says that we are all the offspring of
[47:18] God
[47:19] and that celebrity when he had taught
[47:21] that that celebrity was talking about
[47:23] that we are all offsprings of Zeus
[47:26] so Paul is able to take that and then
[47:29] he's able to get their attention and
[47:33] preach about the true God
[47:36] and how we are actually offsprings of
[47:39] this true God and then he was able to
[47:41] bring Christ into it and it really
[47:44] intrigued
[47:46] these people in Athens
[47:50] so now
[47:52] Paul goes from Athens
[47:55] which was like I said the Hub of the
[47:58] Greek religion he goes to one of the
[48:01] most awful places on Earth at that time
[48:07] and that is the city of Corinth
[48:12] verse number 18 says this and after
[48:15] these things Paul departed from Athens
[48:17] and came to Corinth
[48:21] now
[48:22] Paul and his team they go from Athens
[48:25] they take a ship and I found out today
[48:26] from Brother Lyle that they they sail
[48:29] along and then there's this little
[48:31] Peninsula or this little section of land
[48:34] that they have to they have to go
[48:37] through and they actually Portage the
[48:39] boat they take it and they put it on
[48:41] some sort of of rails or rollers and
[48:43] they drag it across this two is it two
[48:47] miles one or two miles
[48:53] come on brother Lyle
[48:56] we're not we don't live in England
[49:01] thank you about four miles that that
[49:04] they had to bring this boat across this
[49:07] piece of land
[49:08] and then they they get over to this
[49:10] place
[49:12] called Corinth
[49:13] now Corinth was an absolutely massive
[49:17] City
[49:19] we think about Athens and how famous
[49:21] that was but Corinth is somewhere around
[49:23] 15 to 20 side 20 times the size
[49:26] of Athens and it was absolutely evil
[49:33] it was a terrible City and it's neat
[49:36] because I as I was studying on on this
[49:40] this city of Corinth I said you know
[49:43] this looks like a modern day Las Vegas
[49:48] and uh because
[49:51] it was
[49:52] it was filled with prostitution
[49:56] filled with immorality filled with just
[50:00] every type of advice that you had in
[50:03] that day that City had it and it was an
[50:06] absolutely disgusting City I can't say I
[50:11] can't say enough bad about it
[50:14] so Paul
[50:16] he goes into this city like I said a
[50:20] modern day Las Vegas and it blessed me
[50:22] today because when I saw brother Lyle
[50:24] this morning before service brother says
[50:27] hey I'm really looking forward to Acts
[50:28] chapter 18 and he says you know that
[50:31] place was like Las Vegas
[50:33] I was like oh brother we're on the same
[50:35] page that's exactly what I thought so
[50:37] really gave me confirmation in
[50:40] talking about this so we see that Paul
[50:44] goes to this city
[50:46] and there's Believers there not yet but
[50:50] there will be so Paul goes there and
[50:53] he's going to build a church now this
[50:56] place Corinth there's a couple letters
[50:59] that we have in our book
[51:03] that are written to these Believers in
[51:05] Corinth it's called first and second
[51:07] Corinthians
[51:09] so now you see what a bad place this is
[51:13] and you see now Paul is going here and
[51:16] he's going to start this he's going to
[51:17] start this church and he starts up this
[51:20] church and he's preaching like I said
[51:22] he's preaching to the Jews and he's
[51:23] preaching to the Gentiles and he's
[51:24] preaching to the kind of the the
[51:26] converts there he's preaching to all
[51:28] these people but what do you think that
[51:30] they struggled with
[51:32] they struggled with the same things that
[51:34] were prominent in their City
[51:36] so let's let's quickly let's turn to
[51:38] First Corinthians chapter 6. verse 9.
[51:45] now remember
[51:47] Paul is writing this this letter to the
[51:51] Corinthians
[51:52] to correct them
[51:55] and it says this
[51:57] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[51:59] not inherit the kingdom of God
[52:02] be not now Paul remember as I preached
[52:05] on acts 15 and in Galatians last last
[52:08] Sunday remember Paul isn't the farthest
[52:11] thing in the in the world from a
[52:12] legalist
[52:14] but that doesn't mean that Paul is
[52:16] against a holy holy life
[52:20] says here first Corinthians 6 9 know ye
[52:24] not that the unrighteous shall not
[52:25] inherit the kingdom of God
[52:28] be not deceived neither fornicators nor
[52:31] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[52:35] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[52:37] nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards
[52:39] nor nor revelers nor extortion or shall
[52:42] enter shall inherit the kingdom of God
[52:46] now look at this next verse
[52:49] as such were some of you
[52:52] wow
[52:53] so these people that Paul had witnessed
[52:55] to they came out of that
[52:58] but you're washed you're Sanctified but
[53:02] you are justified in the name of the
[53:04] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[53:09] do you remember my sermon on Acts
[53:12] chapter 15 and on the Galatians Paul was
[53:15] correcting a problem of legalism within
[53:19] the church at Antioch there now
[53:24] Paul is writing in First Corinthians he
[53:27] is writing to correct immorality
[53:30] and writing to correct the sin that was
[53:33] prevalent in that area and
[53:37] don't you love the book of Acts now when
[53:40] we read these books and we'll get to
[53:43] Ephesians a little bit later but when we
[53:45] read these books Galatians
[53:47] the Corinthians we see oh this is who
[53:51] this is written to
[53:53] these people in that area were
[53:55] struggling with these types of things
[53:57] that's why you see Corinthians it's a
[54:00] lot of Correction
[54:03] it says here
[54:04] well in Corinthians IT addresses a lot
[54:07] of immorality IT addresses sleeping
[54:09] around before marriage which is called
[54:11] fornication
[54:12] having relations with someone who's not
[54:14] your spouse which is called adultery the
[54:17] difference there between adultery and
[54:18] fornication
[54:21] effeminate it says here and I'm going
[54:24] through these these uh what he mentions
[54:26] here in First Corinthians effeminate
[54:28] which is homosexuals abusers of their
[54:31] selves with mankind which is also
[54:33] homosexuality
[54:35] idolaters which is worshiping anything
[54:37] other than Jehovah God like in Athens
[54:40] thieves
[54:42] covetousness covetous drunkards
[54:45] you know what all those are
[54:48] revelers reveal here revilers which is
[54:52] actually a a modern word is Slanders
[54:58] Slanders that are causing harm to other
[55:01] with others with their words
[55:02] extortioners
[55:06] none of these shall enter the kingdom of
[55:09] God as such were some of you wow that is
[55:13] the church at Corinth so you can see why
[55:16] this church this letter that's written
[55:19] to these people that we're going to be
[55:20] talking about here why it is so
[55:22] corrective
[55:24] it talks about a woman having long hair
[55:26] it talks about how when men and women
[55:29] divorce and and how that that
[55:32] of a man should treat his wife and a
[55:36] woman should treat her husband it's all
[55:38] of these things that are very very
[55:40] important that they didn't know about
[55:43] because they came from such sin
[55:46] so that is the book of First Corinthians
[55:49] and this who I'm talking about right now
[55:52] is who he is he is writing to and now
[55:56] we're seeing he is starting this church
[55:58] in this Sin City called Corinth are we
[56:04] together
[56:05] so we know now what Paul is facing there
[56:12] and he Paul found a certain Jew this is
[56:15] verse number two yeah there we go thank
[56:17] you and found a certain Jew named Aquila
[56:20] born in Pontius
[56:22] lately come from Italy with his wife
[56:25] Priscilla because that Claudius had
[56:27] commanded all the Jews to depart from
[56:29] Rome and came unto them
[56:34] I I don't have time but I could talk
[56:36] about how that that this Emperor had
[56:40] kicked out all the Jews of Rome it you
[56:44] know where it gives an excellent
[56:46] um description as this is in the church
[56:48] age book
[56:49] but it's it's when this man he kicked
[56:53] out all of these Jews because he thought
[56:55] they're causing problems I'll just I'll
[56:58] just say it for a minute so what
[57:01] happened is we had the First Church of
[57:03] Rome okay
[57:05] and this Church of Rome was all of these
[57:09] just
[57:10] solid Jewish believers
[57:14] and these people these people are like
[57:16] Paul Aquila and Priscilla were part of
[57:19] it they were just solid Jewish
[57:23] people that understood Jehovah they
[57:26] understood Christ
[57:28] but this man goes and he kicks out
[57:32] all of the Jews for this First Church of
[57:36] Rome
[57:37] so they all leave and we see that these
[57:43] other people take their places
[57:46] that don't have that walk with the Lord
[57:49] that these Originals had
[57:52] and they bring in idolatry now this is
[57:55] all in the church age book I I recommend
[57:57] that you read it they are they bring in
[57:59] idolatry
[58:01] and then we have
[58:03] the foundations for the Catholic Church
[58:09] that was a bonus I didn't have that in
[58:10] my nose
[58:15] and found a certain Jew
[58:18] named Aquila born in Pontius lately come
[58:21] from Italy with his wife Priscilla
[58:23] because that Claudius had commanded all
[58:25] the Jews to depart from Rome and came
[58:27] unto them and because he was of the same
[58:30] craft he Abode with them so Paul had the
[58:33] same profession as Aquila and Priscilla
[58:36] and wrought for by their occupation they
[58:40] were tent makers
[58:41] so now just because Paul was a minister
[58:44] didn't mean that he was solely dependent
[58:47] on the Believers to support him
[58:51] the in lean times these Ministers of
[58:54] these rabbis back then they always had
[58:57] another craft that they could fall back
[59:00] on that they could do
[59:03] and that's where Paul
[59:05] he must have been taught that in his
[59:08] hometown of Tarsus
[59:10] and that's what that's what happened
[59:12] here so he goes to this Corinth and he
[59:15] goes to work
[59:17] and I think about me I kind of had a
[59:20] similar
[59:22] um
[59:24] experience
[59:26] to where I used to be I used to I went
[59:29] to college and I and I got I I got this
[59:31] job and and when I came back here I
[59:36] needed something to do I needed a job
[59:39] and the Lord provided a job doing the
[59:42] same thing that I used to do way back
[59:44] when and the same thing here happened to
[59:46] Paul he comes here to Corinth and he's
[59:49] able to to step right in and to work in
[59:53] this profession of tent making now when
[59:56] they had the um
[59:58] when they had the synagogues many times
[1:00:01] people that were of the same occupation
[1:00:04] would sit in the same areas
[1:00:08] so when Paul was probably sitting in an
[1:00:14] area he that's maybe I don't know it may
[1:00:17] be how that he met Aquila and Priscilla
[1:00:20] because they were of the same craft they
[1:00:23] did the same type of work
[1:00:26] so we see that that they had this in
[1:00:29] common and then Aquila and Priscilla
[1:00:32] this really great couple and they come
[1:00:34] they come up later on in the scriptures
[1:00:36] they are just a wonderful wonderful uh
[1:00:39] couple people but this friendship that
[1:00:42] they had
[1:00:43] lasted forever
[1:00:45] it really lasted until the end
[1:00:47] we see Aquila and Priscilla we see them
[1:00:49] in Romans
[1:00:51] we see them in First Corinthians
[1:00:54] and we even see them in the second
[1:00:56] letter that Paul wrote to Timothy
[1:01:00] which is the last work that he penned
[1:01:03] that we have record of
[1:01:06] so the right at the very end of his life
[1:01:08] Paul even mentions Aquila and Priscilla
[1:01:11] so they were lifelong friends and they
[1:01:14] probably met most likely met right here
[1:01:16] in Corinth
[1:01:18] and he reasoned and Paul reasoned in the
[1:01:20] synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded
[1:01:23] the Jews and the Greeks
[1:01:25] so again as I mentioned we have the Jews
[1:01:27] and the Greeks in the same church we
[1:01:29] have the the ones that feared God these
[1:01:31] are those converts that came in and then
[1:01:34] we have the the real Jews
[1:01:38] and when Silas and timothius would come
[1:01:40] from Macedonia Paul was pressed in the
[1:01:43] spirit and testified to the Jews that
[1:01:46] Jesus was Christ now we all know who
[1:01:49] Silas is
[1:01:51] but this timotheus this is Timothy
[1:01:55] this is someone that Paul writes his
[1:01:58] letters to when he's in when Timothy's
[1:02:01] in Ephesus
[1:02:03] and when they oppose themselves
[1:02:06] that word opposed it means that they
[1:02:09] opposed Paul
[1:02:11] and when they opposed themselves and
[1:02:14] blasphemed he shook his raiment and said
[1:02:17] unto them your blood be upon your own
[1:02:19] heads I am clean from henceforth I will
[1:02:23] go until the Gen unto the Gentiles
[1:02:26] Paul was fed up with this hypocrisy
[1:02:29] among the Jews and he said
[1:02:33] he said if they don't accept now Paul
[1:02:37] was doing something a Jewish Tradition
[1:02:39] now you remember in the gospels when
[1:02:42] Jesus sent out his disciples to preach
[1:02:46] and to heal the sick do you remember
[1:02:47] that
[1:02:49] and he said when you come to a city
[1:02:52] and they don't accept you
[1:02:54] he said Shake the Dust off of your
[1:02:57] sandals Shake the Dust off of your
[1:02:59] clothes and then go to the next one now
[1:03:01] what that was is that was a Jewish
[1:03:03] tradition so what would happen is the
[1:03:05] Jews they would be in the Gentile area
[1:03:08] and they would go and then they would
[1:03:10] come home to their Hometown to their
[1:03:13] home Jewish country and before they
[1:03:17] would walk in they would stop at the
[1:03:19] border they would take off their shoes
[1:03:21] and they would knock the dirty Gentile
[1:03:24] dust off of their shoes and then they
[1:03:28] would put them back on and they would
[1:03:29] walk these proud stuck up Jews I hate to
[1:03:35] say it but that's what it was
[1:03:36] so what Paul is doing here
[1:03:39] this is a serious insult to the Jews so
[1:03:45] what Paul is saying is I'm going to
[1:03:48] shake this legalistic gust
[1:03:51] off of my clothes and I'm going to go to
[1:03:54] these more pure Gentiles the exact
[1:03:58] opposite of what the Jewish tradition
[1:04:00] was that was that was a slap
[1:04:03] right there but the boldness of Paul
[1:04:07] he's he's like well it's what's good for
[1:04:10] what's saying what's good for the goose
[1:04:12] is good for the gander and he's like
[1:04:15] listen you're the ones that are dirty
[1:04:17] not them
[1:04:18] so he shakes that nasty dust off of his
[1:04:22] clothes and then he's going to the
[1:04:25] Gentiles he's saying I'm done with you
[1:04:27] with your closed-minded legalistic
[1:04:30] self-righteous ways finished with it
[1:04:34] and he departed vents
[1:04:36] and entered into a certain man's house
[1:04:38] named justice one that worshiped God
[1:04:40] whose house was joined hard to the
[1:04:43] synagogue
[1:04:44] so Paul is in there and he's debating
[1:04:47] maybe with these with these Pharisees
[1:04:49] and and these Jews these legalistic Jews
[1:04:53] now he is able to
[1:04:56] if it got rough
[1:04:59] but for God's serious Paul could just
[1:05:02] exit stages left right into
[1:05:05] or stage right whatever this may be
[1:05:07] right for you but right into this house
[1:05:10] of justice
[1:05:11] and go right in there and be safe
[1:05:15] I think it was a
[1:05:19] he stayed with Justice and I think
[1:05:22] who was it that he stayed with
[1:05:24] last chapter
[1:05:27] um
[1:05:29] same thing he stays with this guy
[1:05:31] Justice is Jason Jason is who it was he
[1:05:33] stayed in Jason's house and Jason
[1:05:35] suffered persecution for housing Paul
[1:05:41] and Christmas the chief ruler of the
[1:05:44] synagogue believed on the Lord
[1:05:47] with all his house and many of the
[1:05:51] Corinthians hearing believed and were
[1:05:53] baptized
[1:05:55] so still
[1:05:57] Paul with that gift of being able to
[1:06:00] bring the message to the people
[1:06:04] now
[1:06:06] Crispus
[1:06:08] he was you know what there is a let's go
[1:06:11] to First Corinthians 1 14 real quick let
[1:06:13] me let me read that
[1:06:15] so he was he was Paul's convert and it
[1:06:18] says here
[1:06:19] I thank God that I baptized none of you
[1:06:21] but Crispus and Gaius so this man right
[1:06:24] here this Christmas this this leader of
[1:06:28] of the synagogue
[1:06:30] Paul actually baptized him I love when
[1:06:32] the two scriptures come together it's
[1:06:34] like oh that's that guy
[1:06:35] just just great
[1:06:40] but we see in the next verse we see
[1:06:43] these conversions going on and we see
[1:06:45] the the Lord moving but we see in the
[1:06:49] next verse that things aren't all
[1:06:51] butterflies and daisies in Corinth
[1:06:53] things are going to go south here in
[1:06:56] just a minute
[1:06:57] it was a case in lystra when Paul was
[1:07:00] stoned it was he was threatened in
[1:07:01] thessalonica if you remember as we're
[1:07:03] going through this book The Believers
[1:07:05] snuck him out of thessalonica in Berea
[1:07:08] same thing they had to get him out of
[1:07:09] there pretty much everywhere Paul has
[1:07:12] been it's been persecution persecution
[1:07:15] persecution by these Jewish people and
[1:07:18] Corinth was turning out the same
[1:07:21] the in the Bible
[1:07:23] doesn't say it but he had to be having
[1:07:27] problems because of this next verse
[1:07:31] the Lord then spake the Lord to Paul in
[1:07:35] the Night by a vision
[1:07:36] so there must have been something coming
[1:07:38] against Paul
[1:07:39] be not afraid but speak and hold not thy
[1:07:43] peace
[1:07:44] for I am with thee and no man shall set
[1:07:47] on thee to hurt thee for I have much
[1:07:51] people in this city I think what an
[1:07:53] encouragement
[1:07:54] what an encouragement to Paul that the
[1:07:56] Lord Jesus speaking to his servant and
[1:07:59] telling him that I'm with you Paul
[1:08:04] and these people that the Lord is
[1:08:07] talking about they had no idea that they
[1:08:09] were about to become Christians they had
[1:08:12] probably never heard the name of Jesus
[1:08:13] before in their lives but it was about
[1:08:16] to happen that there was going to form a
[1:08:21] Christian Church in the city of Corinth
[1:08:25] for the Lord he said that I have much
[1:08:28] people in this city
[1:08:30] and I would like
[1:08:32] I wish that I could get sometimes I wish
[1:08:34] I could get that same Assurance for here
[1:08:36] in Tucson
[1:08:38] that there are a lot of people
[1:08:40] that are God's people that still need to
[1:08:43] come to him I would love to have that
[1:08:45] Assurance from God that there are that
[1:08:48] there are still people hungry for the
[1:08:50] Lord but I believe this day is is not
[1:08:53] the day that Paul was in
[1:08:54] it's just few and far between
[1:08:57] the Lord hasn't told me but
[1:09:00] I just have to go on believing that
[1:09:02] there are more people
[1:09:04] in our city that can come to God that
[1:09:06] can come to Christ
[1:09:08] and he continued there a year and six
[1:09:11] months he was in Corinth for a long time
[1:09:14] and he continued there a year and six
[1:09:16] months teaching the word of God among
[1:09:18] them
[1:09:20] so even after he shook the dust from His
[1:09:23] Garment he stayed there
[1:09:27] and when galio
[1:09:29] was the deputy of a a Kai AKA
[1:09:33] the Jews made Insurrection with one
[1:09:35] Accord against Paul and brought him to
[1:09:38] the Judgment seat here we go again
[1:09:41] we know this story well it's happened
[1:09:44] over and over and over
[1:09:45] so they they the Jews go and they stir
[1:09:48] things up and they bring them to the
[1:09:51] Roman Authority
[1:09:53] saying this fellow persuadeth man to
[1:09:56] worship God contrary to the law same
[1:10:00] thing that these two troublemakers when
[1:10:02] they came to Antioch they're saying the
[1:10:04] same thing this guy isn't preaching what
[1:10:08] our law says he could he should preach
[1:10:11] and just like Antioch and everywhere
[1:10:14] else the legalistic Jews do not like
[1:10:17] Paul's message about Christ
[1:10:20] and not having to live according to the
[1:10:22] law they cannot stand
[1:10:25] that message
[1:10:26] so they try to get the Roman Authority
[1:10:28] as I said to arrest Paul
[1:10:30] why not have worked in Jerusalem with
[1:10:33] Jesus
[1:10:34] why wouldn't it work here
[1:10:38] you know Satan has a bag of tricks
[1:10:40] and those tricks work pretty well
[1:10:43] and he takes those tricks and he uses
[1:10:45] them over and over and over again
[1:10:50] many times
[1:10:51] he appeals to the legalistic nature of a
[1:10:55] religious person
[1:10:58] and when Paul was now about to open his
[1:11:01] mouth so he was about to say
[1:11:03] give himself a defense
[1:11:07] galio said unto the Jews now Galileo is
[1:11:10] this ruler said unto the Jews if it were
[1:11:12] a matter of wrong or Wicked lewdness
[1:11:15] OU Jews reason would that I should bear
[1:11:18] with you but if it be a question of
[1:11:21] words and names and your law look Ye Ye
[1:11:24] into it
[1:11:28] for I will be no judge of such matters
[1:11:32] the same thing very very similar thing
[1:11:33] that happened to Jesus Remember When
[1:11:36] pilate had Jesus and he's like oh what
[1:11:38] am I going to do this is just this is a
[1:11:40] mess and he says oh
[1:11:42] hear it I'll send them to Herod and let
[1:11:45] him deal with it so that's exactly what
[1:11:47] happens to here here that they're trying
[1:11:51] to get this man to do their dirty work
[1:11:57] and now this galio
[1:12:00] didn't even give Paul a chance to talk
[1:12:02] now
[1:12:04] this is where the Lord remember he just
[1:12:07] promised Paul protect you
[1:12:09] Now watch how God protects Paul
[1:12:15] he says
[1:12:17] if it were a matter of wrong or Wicked
[1:12:19] lewdness or ye Jews reason would that I
[1:12:22] should bear with you but if it be a a
[1:12:25] question of matters and names and of
[1:12:26] your law look ye into it for I will be
[1:12:29] no judge in such matters and he galio
[1:12:33] drove them from the Judgment seat
[1:12:36] then all the Greek Greeks so now they're
[1:12:40] all fired up Paul's gone
[1:12:42] so the Greeks took this guy named
[1:12:45] sosthenese
[1:12:46] the chief ruler of the synagogue and
[1:12:48] beat him before the Judgment seat and
[1:12:50] Galileo cared for none of those things
[1:12:53] who is sosthenese where did he come from
[1:12:56] I thought the other guy
[1:12:58] was the rule of the synagogue
[1:13:01] so we have a new ruler of the synagogue
[1:13:03] somebody must have got kicked out
[1:13:06] so now we have sustanies
[1:13:09] and uh sustanese is also
[1:13:14] in the Bible
[1:13:20] where is he
[1:13:22] he's Paul's writing a letter from
[1:13:24] Corinth and it says and oh yeah it was I
[1:13:27] think it was first Corinthians first or
[1:13:29] second Corinthians there Paul is writing
[1:13:31] back to to the Corinthians and and he's
[1:13:35] he's saying these things and he says oh
[1:13:37] ingredients from softon he's our brother
[1:13:39] and like oh sosthenes you remember him
[1:13:42] yeah he just disappeared one day oh he's
[1:13:44] with Paul good I'm glad I'm glad he's in
[1:13:46] good shape
[1:13:47] so Paul was Paul this sustines actually
[1:13:51] traveled with Paul and Paul after this
[1:13:54] Terry there
[1:13:56] a good while
[1:13:59] and then took his leave of the Brethren
[1:14:01] and sailed thence to Syria and with him
[1:14:04] Priscilla and Aquila having shorn his
[1:14:07] head in centria for he had a vow
[1:14:11] now so Paul is leaving Corinth
[1:14:16] and it seems like he shaves his head but
[1:14:19] actually he really just cuts his hair
[1:14:23] and what did this mean
[1:14:25] that that he he he was shorn because he
[1:14:30] had a vow well if you look back in the
[1:14:33] Old Testament
[1:14:34] you have there's a word that all of us
[1:14:37] are familiar with
[1:14:39] and it's called a Nazarite vow
[1:14:43] and this Nazarite vow means that this
[1:14:46] this man he wouldn't drink wine he
[1:14:49] wouldn't do a lot of other things and
[1:14:51] one of the things that he also wouldn't
[1:14:52] do is cut his hair
[1:14:54] now can you think of someone that had a
[1:14:57] Nazarite vowel
[1:14:59] just say it
[1:15:01] Samson right Samson had a Nazarite vow
[1:15:05] so he let his hair grow long you know
[1:15:08] somebody else that did
[1:15:09] Samuel
[1:15:11] the prophet he also had this vow so they
[1:15:15] they would go they would go for this
[1:15:17] period of time when they had this vow
[1:15:19] and then when their their time was over
[1:15:22] then they'd get a haircut
[1:15:24] and that's what happened right here is
[1:15:26] Paul got a haircut
[1:15:28] before he left now we think so much
[1:15:33] because of Paul's message especially to
[1:15:35] the Galatians but all throughout Paul's
[1:15:37] message he is saying listen you don't
[1:15:41] have to live up live up to all these
[1:15:43] Jewish rules
[1:15:45] circumcision and and diet and all these
[1:15:48] things and and really pressing that but
[1:15:51] if you look at Paul right here Paul
[1:15:53] greatly reverenced
[1:15:57] the tradition of the Jews
[1:16:00] for himself that Nazarite vow
[1:16:03] Paul
[1:16:05] held that in a high regard so much that
[1:16:08] he took this Jewish vow
[1:16:11] and we see
[1:16:15] that Paul
[1:16:18] and and we'll see here in a little bit
[1:16:22] that
[1:16:25] he even more reverenced the Jewish the
[1:16:29] Jewish traditions
[1:16:31] and when he came to Ephesus
[1:16:34] and left them there
[1:16:36] but he himself entered into the
[1:16:39] synagogue and reasons with the Jews so
[1:16:41] now he's out of Corinth and he goes to
[1:16:43] Ephesus Ephesus is a big city like
[1:16:46] Corinth
[1:16:47] and there's a lot of Jews
[1:16:50] so the so the Jews at at Corinth they
[1:16:53] disgusted him so much he shook the duff
[1:16:55] dust off of his clothes and he didn't go
[1:16:57] back into that synagogue but now he goes
[1:17:00] to another city oh and he goes right
[1:17:01] into the synagogue
[1:17:03] at Ephesus
[1:17:06] Paul doesn't care
[1:17:08] he doesn't care if you're Jewish if you
[1:17:10] come from his background he doesn't care
[1:17:12] if you're Greek he doesn't care if
[1:17:13] you're Roman he doesn't care if you've
[1:17:15] you accept Jehovah or not he doesn't
[1:17:17] care if you're an idolater Paul wants
[1:17:20] everyone to come to Christ
[1:17:24] and he proves that in every city that he
[1:17:26] preaches look at the variety of people
[1:17:27] that Paul is preaching to
[1:17:29] so he comes to this city at Ephesus
[1:17:32] again there's no Christian churches yet
[1:17:34] so he goes in and the only places that
[1:17:37] he has to preach are in these synagogues
[1:17:42] so when they
[1:17:45] desired now remember he's in Ephesus
[1:17:48] when they desired him to tear a longer
[1:17:51] time with them he consented not wow
[1:17:55] that's different
[1:17:57] remember all the other places like get
[1:17:59] away get away get away
[1:18:01] kill him you know throw him in jail get
[1:18:03] rid of them but these people at Ephesus
[1:18:05] they're like well we want to hear some
[1:18:07] more
[1:18:09] so these people the Ephesians had
[1:18:13] something a little bit a little bit
[1:18:15] special it seems like to me and if you
[1:18:18] read the book of Ephesians
[1:18:20] you'll see that it's a much more
[1:18:22] advanced letter
[1:18:25] than the book The Book of Corinthians
[1:18:27] the books of Corinthians
[1:18:30] and he goes back to Ephesus later on
[1:18:34] in fact he goes back to Ephesus in the
[1:18:36] next chapter in chapter 19. so we talk
[1:18:39] about a little bit more about the
[1:18:40] Ephesians in in there but I will say
[1:18:43] this that the central theme
[1:18:46] of the book of Ephesians is the Holy
[1:18:48] Spirit
[1:18:49] and
[1:18:51] Paul
[1:18:53] preaching a deeper Doctrine to these
[1:18:56] people
[1:18:57] than he does to the Corinthians and
[1:19:01] we'll see here in the next chapter and
[1:19:04] I'll leave that into the capable hands
[1:19:06] of brother Lyle to show us what message
[1:19:09] Paul preaches to in to the Ephesians in
[1:19:14] the next chapter
[1:19:16] verse number 21.
[1:19:17] but Paul made them farewell
[1:19:20] saying I must by all means keep this
[1:19:22] Feast that cometh in Jerusalem but I
[1:19:25] will return again to you if God will and
[1:19:27] he sailed to Ephesus again Paul Paul is
[1:19:30] showing that he has not forsaken his
[1:19:31] Jewish roots
[1:19:33] he was honoring the Jewish tradition of
[1:19:36] the feast in Jerusalem
[1:19:38] and when he had landed in caesarea and
[1:19:40] gone up and saluted the church he went
[1:19:42] down to Antioch
[1:19:44] now there's a lot in that verse 22 that
[1:19:48] may not that may not be all of that
[1:19:51] apparent
[1:19:53] it says here and when he landed at
[1:19:54] caesarea and gone up
[1:19:58] right Jerusalem he salute to the church
[1:20:02] and he went down to Antioch now
[1:20:05] Jerusalem
[1:20:07] is a high elevation in that part of the
[1:20:10] world
[1:20:11] in fact it's about the same elevation as
[1:20:14] Tucson
[1:20:15] fact it's about the same latitude as
[1:20:17] Tucson and if if you go to Israel it
[1:20:21] actually looks a lot like Arizona looks
[1:20:24] like this part of the world so Paul so
[1:20:27] pretty much anywhere in that area you
[1:20:30] have to go up
[1:20:32] to Jerusalem and that's why it says here
[1:20:35] and had gone up it's up in elevation
[1:20:39] so they went up to Jerusalem
[1:20:43] now it's odd to me that we don't know
[1:20:46] more about this visit
[1:20:48] than a politics it's odd to me that it's
[1:20:50] like well why isn't a little bit more
[1:20:52] written we don't know there's nothing
[1:20:56] significant enough to be recorded in the
[1:20:58] Bible of this trip but one thing that we
[1:21:01] can assume is this was a short trip
[1:21:05] and after he had spent some time there
[1:21:07] in Jerusalem he departed and went over
[1:21:10] all the country of galatia and frigia in
[1:21:14] order strengthening all the disciples
[1:21:16] and a certain Jew named Apollos
[1:21:19] born at Alexandria an eloquent man and
[1:21:23] mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus
[1:21:27] now this guy is intriguing
[1:21:31] this man Apollos
[1:21:34] very very interesting man this is the
[1:21:37] first right here this is the first we
[1:21:39] hear about Apollos but he plays a very
[1:21:42] important role in the message going out
[1:21:45] to the different churches
[1:21:47] in First Corinthians Paul mentions that
[1:21:49] there are fightings among the people you
[1:21:51] remember that scripture that there's
[1:21:53] fighting among the people some say that
[1:21:55] I am of Paul
[1:21:56] and some Apollos and some Peter
[1:22:01] so Paul is putting this man Apollos
[1:22:04] right up there with him and Peter
[1:22:07] this man must have been very very good
[1:22:11] at what he did
[1:22:15] this man
[1:22:16] was instructed in the way of the Lord
[1:22:19] and being fervent in the spirit he spake
[1:22:22] and taught diligently the things of the
[1:22:25] Lord knowing only the baptism of John
[1:22:29] now for those who say baptism isn't
[1:22:31] important right here you can see that
[1:22:34] that if you just knew the doctrine and
[1:22:38] the baptism
[1:22:39] of the Prophet John the Baptist your
[1:22:42] understanding was incomplete
[1:22:47] this man of paulus
[1:22:48] was from Alexandria Alexandria is in
[1:22:51] Egypt
[1:22:53] which is one of the biggest cities in
[1:22:55] the world and it had an enormous Jewish
[1:22:58] population
[1:23:00] it also had some of the best schools on
[1:23:02] the planet
[1:23:04] so we can assume that Apollos was
[1:23:06] probably highly educated in this city in
[1:23:09] his hometown of Alexandria
[1:23:11] so somehow the teaching of John the
[1:23:13] Baptist came to Apollos and he began
[1:23:16] preaching John's message
[1:23:19] now he didn't know about anything about
[1:23:21] the day of Pentecost he didn't know
[1:23:22] about the Holy Spirit he didn't even
[1:23:24] know about the baptism in the name of
[1:23:25] Jesus Christ but he is still one of the
[1:23:27] most gifted preachers that anyone had
[1:23:29] ever met
[1:23:31] so he shows up at evidence Ephesus and
[1:23:33] he starts preaching John the Baptist's
[1:23:35] message
[1:23:39] and it goes to show that there is so
[1:23:41] much about John the Baptist that we
[1:23:43] don't know
[1:23:45] he John the Baptist
[1:23:47] we know that he was a powerful Minister
[1:23:49] we know that he preached against
[1:23:51] marriage marriage and divorce when Herod
[1:23:54] married his brother-in-law's or his
[1:23:57] brother's wife Philip's wife
[1:23:59] we know that he preached the Messiah we
[1:24:03] know
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:06] he preached against obviously preached
[1:24:10] against divorce and he preached against
[1:24:12] the priests and he preached the Messiah
[1:24:14] but it must have been a very deep
[1:24:17] message to have gone as far as John the
[1:24:20] Baptist message went he must have been
[1:24:23] really something that we don't read here
[1:24:26] in the Bible
[1:24:31] now Paul now Apollos
[1:24:34] and he began to speak boldly in the
[1:24:36] synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla
[1:24:38] had heard they took under they took him
[1:24:41] under them and expounded unto them the
[1:24:44] way of God more perfectly
[1:24:47] so Aquila and Priscilla they knew Paul
[1:24:50] and they knew Christ and they knew the
[1:24:54] Holy Spirit and they knew baptism so
[1:24:57] they take one of the most gifted
[1:24:59] ministers probably in the world at that
[1:25:01] time he comes into their home and
[1:25:04] they're probably like hey Apollos you're
[1:25:06] really good
[1:25:08] but you need to know a little bit more
[1:25:12] so they bring him in and they start
[1:25:14] teaching him and what struck me the most
[1:25:18] from the scripture is look at the
[1:25:20] humility of Apollos
[1:25:23] educated
[1:25:25] knew the word knew the scriptures knew
[1:25:28] the Torah knew it better than anyone and
[1:25:31] here he is with this humble Little
[1:25:33] Couple comes in and they tell him about
[1:25:36] Christ and they tell him about the Holy
[1:25:38] Spirit and he accepts it with all of his
[1:25:41] heart what a humble man
[1:25:43] what a good man
[1:25:46] and when he was disposed in fact brother
[1:25:49] Branham
[1:25:50] Likens Apollos
[1:25:52] to Billy Graham
[1:25:55] Billy Graham was probably
[1:25:58] as far as the church world the one of
[1:26:01] the greatest ministers Christian
[1:26:02] ministers the world's ever seen
[1:26:06] and for brother Branham to compare this
[1:26:08] man of paulus
[1:26:10] to Billy Graham is a great compliment
[1:26:13] from him also
[1:26:18] and when
[1:26:20] he was disposed to pass unto Ikea
[1:26:24] the Brethren wrote exhorting the
[1:26:25] disciples to receive him who when he was
[1:26:28] come helped them much which had believed
[1:26:31] through Grace
[1:26:33] for he mightily convinced the Jews and
[1:26:36] that publicly showing by the scriptures
[1:26:38] that Jesus was the Christ and and we can
[1:26:42] close if the if the musicians would come
[1:26:44] so this man Apollos Aquila and Priscilla
[1:26:48] they explained to him these things and
[1:26:50] you know like the bereans do you
[1:26:51] remember the bereans from last week
[1:26:53] they went and they checked the
[1:26:55] scriptures I guarantee you Apollos did
[1:26:56] too
[1:26:57] so they take they take Apollos takes
[1:27:00] what Aquila and Priscilla had told him
[1:27:03] and enlightened him
[1:27:05] and then he was able to take that
[1:27:09] Revelation
[1:27:10] and really present it
[1:27:14] to the people
[1:27:16] and there were groups
[1:27:18] that had heard now Apollos as I said he
[1:27:21] was all over the place in a great
[1:27:23] Minister there were groups that had
[1:27:26] heard Apollos before that he probably
[1:27:29] had this revelation of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:31] and of Christ
[1:27:34] and Paul actually goes and encounters
[1:27:40] one of these groups
[1:27:43] and how did Paul handle this
[1:27:47] when he encountered Apollos this great
[1:27:50] man
[1:27:51] comes and he preaches this Gospel of
[1:27:54] John the Baptist and he converts these
[1:27:57] people and then Paul comes in
[1:28:01] and he starts preaching Jesus they're
[1:28:04] like oh yeah we know
[1:28:07] and how did Paul handle it
[1:28:11] brother lie I was going to tell you
[1:28:14] in his in his sermon on Wednesday it's
[1:28:17] beautiful Acts chapter 19 is is a
[1:28:20] wonderful wonderful chapter

[1:28:37] see the different people you see from
[1:28:39] Athens
[1:28:41] in 17 and you see these just idolaters
[1:28:46] and Paul is able to speak to them in
[1:28:48] their language you see that he comes
[1:28:51] here to Corinth and the most evil Sin
[1:28:54] City that that you could ever find Paul
[1:28:56] goes right in jumps in and forms a
[1:28:59] church right there

[1:32:00] Lord Jesus we're thankful Lord that we
[1:32:04] were able to gather together here in
[1:32:05] this building Lord we love to dig into
[1:32:09] your your word your Bible Lord and and
[1:32:12] we see
[1:32:13] they were just humans they were just
[1:32:16] people just like we are and we can
[1:32:19] relate to to many of their
[1:32:23] misunderstandings maybe their questions
[1:32:26] that they had on on who you are they're
[1:32:29] their thirst for understanding
[1:32:33] uh who created them wanting to to know
[1:32:38] where they came from and and their
[1:32:42] excitement when they found answers in
[1:32:45] the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:47] we can relate to a lot of these stories
[1:32:50] Lord and
[1:32:52] they failed just like we do and
[1:32:56] quarreled among each other just like we
[1:32:58] do
[1:33:00] they needed to ask for forgiveness just
[1:33:03] like we do Lord and
[1:33:07] we love to to see your Bible come alive
[1:33:10] and
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:13] just ask that
[1:33:16] one day Lord will be able to to spend
[1:33:20] time with these characters that we're
[1:33:22] reading about Lord and to think that
[1:33:25] it's really we're part of the same story
[1:33:28] and we get to spend eternity with some
[1:33:33] of these characters Lord and
[1:33:37] we I I don't understand it here on this
[1:33:39] side but what a
[1:33:43] what a remarkable thing that'll be to to
[1:33:46] be able to to talk for a thousand years
[1:33:49] to each one and they're going to have
[1:33:52] questions for us just like we have of
[1:33:55] them and
[1:33:58] all part of
[1:34:00] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:34:03] we're thankful that's again more that
[1:34:06] we're able to to Fellowship around your
[1:34:09] word we just ask that you would forgive
[1:34:12] us where we've fallen short
[1:34:14] give us
[1:34:16] strength and courage to depress the
[1:34:18] battle and maybe
[1:34:20] take this light of the gospel and shine
[1:34:24] it to those around us in a
