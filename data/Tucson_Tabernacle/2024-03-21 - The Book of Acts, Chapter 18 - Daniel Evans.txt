draw closer to you to one another Lord we thank you we thank you again for this privilege that we have to come to you and Jesus precious name amen brother Jordan if you could put up that picture that I gave you this morning yeah there we go now there's two wonderful things in this image the first of course is my sweetheart and the second you notice in the baptistry there's a painting in the background of these mountains and these are those mountains this is at the monida border we were going up to a family reunion in the very northern part of the panhandle of Idaho this last week and we'd driven past this place a couple of times since we've been married but it's always been either coming in the wrong direction bad weather you can't see it and this time it was visible and we could see it and we wanted to get get a picture of it and Heather was so happy to be able to to finally see this I was happy to I'd seen it back in 1970 with brother Francois when we were on a trip but uh anyway and and and I won't tell you about how he had to make a huge turn on the free where it says authorized Vehicles only but but I said Heather I'm authorizing this turn and we went ahead and and we made it so anyway that's on the moon either border if you're ever headed up Interstate 15 and just as you approach the Border Crossing into Montana you'll see a sign that says monida one mile uh don't go that far just before you get there there's a chain up area on the side of the road that's where you want to stop and that's where you can get that picture and the and the mountains are just perfectly framed there uh anyway that was just a real blessing but we had opportunity to be with family have their side of the family the wear side and a couple of cousins that uh they're not Christians uh I'm not certain that they're anti-christian but they certainly don't believe in uh in the Lord and their dad uh Heather's father's brother Heather's Uncle he was very adamant about not being a Christian but his wife Gwendolyn she became a Christian and I know that she was praying for her sons two boys Greg and Keith and and it turned out that in this property that we went to uh to have this family reunion that the cabin that Heather and I were in was the same cabin that these two brothers were in her cousins that she may be seen twice in her life and we were way off at one end of the property together so we were able to spend some time in Fellowship there and and we were able to answer some questions in a way that was not offensive to them that respected them but still brought in the Lord Jesus Christ and and and and and you know we were invited to stop by then see them and so forth so I I feel like there was progress made if you happen to think of of Keith and Greg Ware Greg is a retired University professor in Keith is is I'm not sure exactly what he is except he's basically retired as well I think but but these these men and their families need the Lord Jesus and and and I believe that that we won't be complete without them so we need to reach out and embrace him if you remember them in your prayers we'd really really appreciate that um and uh I don't know what else to say except that we had a good time a good time in the Lord a good time renewing connection with family and uh and and that in some way we were able to uh to to be a witness for Jesus Christ and and that is always always a privilege so God bless you thank you for humoring me with uh This Isn't She Lovely I don't know how I could be such a lucky guy to be married to Heather God bless you our wives love us when we get to stand behind it's amazing I remember seeing sister grain somewhere around what sister Matisse says and going like this to brother Greene but it never stopped him it's the the Seven Peaks on that border the brother Brandon the Lord showed him that was his his life and all that's what that was there's amen Sweet Hour of Prayer I'm sorry the lily of the valley I have found a friend in Jesus you know I found him but he knew me already and that's that's wonderful [Music] [Music] the lily of the valley in him all I need to cleanse and make me [Music] if

that you know this this morning brother Daniel speaking speaking of a relationship with God talking about it's not just to know him by name or an acquaintance from a distance but a relationship a fellowship that's true and as he was finishing up sitting there and I just had my eyes closed and praying felt the Lord just tell me it's a job where it's work something you do to establish the relationship and and I just thought well we don't work for this he said no but it's a denying of self and I just felt he said to me you see I had to go to Calvary I had to deny myself to go to Calgary to make sure this relationship was going to work and it is working I said to brother Daniel I said you know we just me and my wife on Thursday I believe it was we we passed 44 years married and uh I uh I I owe it all to her basically I think she's she's been a wonderful lady and a sister and all but it's it's a relationship just just because you say you're married doesn't start it's a constant constant working and doing and I felt he just said just give of yourself and work that relationship all drawn out to you so if you just sit there and say Lord here I am waiting he's wanting to see

put everything on God make sure that we are also doing our part to have that relationship with him I am I appreciated that for the Lyle sister Heather it's good to good to have you all back with us there you are God bless you Let's uh we've been going into the book of Acts and I've been getting some feedback from some different folks that have been blessed by our study on this book I've been hearing a lot of people say that you know I never I thought I've read the book of Acts I thought I understood it but I never really understood it I never understood that there was so much that this book was so rich and it is it's just it's so as uh the song goes so deep you can't get under it so high I forgot but you know the song I'm talking about it's a great song I just can't remember it Let's uh let's get started in this in this book of Acts chapter 18. So what had happened in chapter 17 is Paul had just been to this place of of Greek culture and Society with Greek gods everywhere lining the streets and the marketplaces it was this place called Athens so Paul Paul was there and and he was able to preach to these people and to bring it right down to the level that they understood as I said Athens was a hub of Greek culture and we see that Paul as he was walking down the marketplace he saw all the different idols and all the different temples and he went by this place called the Temple of the unknown God and he used that place as he went up on the mountain he used that place to preach a message to these gentile people and we know that we have seen now from our study in the book of Acts that that we see really three different kinds of people that Paul is preaching to he's preaching number one to the Jews in the synagogues these are the ones that have accepted the Lord Jesus and have a background that have been taught by probably the Pharisees but the Pharisees or the Sadducees and they have seen Paul has explained to them and showed them this Jesus Christ in the Old Testament in from from Genesis from Abraham all the way through Moses teaching and all the prophets Paul has been able to show them how Jesus fulfills all these prophecies so we have those Jews and then we have these other folks that the Bible says that they feared God so these are these Gentiles that have come in and accepted at least part of the Jewish Theology of the one God a monotheistic religion which is not normal for really anyone outside the Jewish people so they were able to come in and they had accepted this Jewish god but they had not yet accepted the Jewish way of living with all the rules and the regulations so we have that group and those two people those two types of people were in the synagogues and then we see in the Athenians we see in the the ones from Athens we see this other this whole new group of these people that knew absolutely nothing about God all they knew was idols and and and and idol worship and and all of these different Greek gods and Zeus and mercury and all all these different ones that there are thousands of them that they had worshiped so we see in Athens we see those people start to show an interest in this Christianity I appreciated what brother Lyle said when you came up here you said um that you asked for prayer are these were these family members I couldn't quite hear that their family members and I appreciated brother Lyle saying that he was able to answer some questions without being offensive very very wise and we see the Apostle Paul has he's the master of that wisdom to where he could bring it right down to where everyone he was talking to whether it's the Pharisee theologians or whether it's these Greek Jews or whether it's these converts or whether it's these completely heathen people he could speak to all of them so I see you brother Lyle maybe you were able to apply some of this book of Acts that maybe that we've been studying to to your wisdom and I did appreciate the way that you said that without being offensive we saw that Paul in Athens he quotes actually he's talking to these completely idolaters and he actually quotes a famous celebrity of the day and he says that that this celebrity says that we are all the offspring of God and that celebrity when he had taught that that celebrity was talking about that we are all offsprings of Zeus so Paul is able to take that and then he's able to get their attention and preach about the true God and how we are actually offsprings of this true God and then he was able to bring Christ into it and it really intrigued these people in Athens so now Paul goes from Athens which was like I said the Hub of the Greek religion he goes to one of the most awful places on Earth at that time and that is the city of Corinth verse number 18 says this and after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth now Paul and his team they go from Athens they take a ship and I found out today from Brother Lyle that they they sail along and then there's this little Peninsula or this little section of land that they have to they have to go through and they actually Portage the boat they take it and they put it on some sort of of rails or rollers and they drag it across this two is it two miles one or two miles come on brother Lyle we're not we don't live in England thank you about four miles that that they had to bring this boat across this piece of land and then they they get over to this place called Corinth now Corinth was an absolutely massive City we think about Athens and how famous that was but Corinth is somewhere around 15 to 20 side 20 times the size of Athens and it was absolutely evil it was a terrible City and it's neat because I as I was studying on on this this city of Corinth I said you know this looks like a modern day Las Vegas and uh because it was it was filled with prostitution filled with immorality filled with just every type of advice that you had in that day that City had it and it was an absolutely disgusting City I can't say I can't say enough bad about it so Paul he goes into this city like I said a modern day Las Vegas and it blessed me today because when I saw brother Lyle this morning before service brother says hey I'm really looking forward to Acts chapter 18 and he says you know that place was like Las Vegas I was like oh brother we're on the same page that's exactly what I thought so really gave me confirmation in talking about this so we see that Paul goes to this city and there's Believers there not yet but there will be so Paul goes there and he's going to build a church now this place Corinth there's a couple letters that we have in our book that are written to these Believers in Corinth it's called first and second Corinthians so now you see what a bad place this is and you see now Paul is going here and he's going to start this he's going to start this church and he starts up this church and he's preaching like I said he's preaching to the Jews and he's preaching to the Gentiles and he's preaching to the kind of the the converts there he's preaching to all these people but what do you think that they struggled with they struggled with the same things that were prominent in their City so let's let's quickly let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 6. verse 9. now remember Paul is writing this this letter to the Corinthians to correct them and it says this know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not now Paul remember as I preached on acts 15 and in Galatians last last Sunday remember Paul isn't the farthest thing in the in the world from a legalist but that doesn't mean that Paul is against a holy holy life says here first Corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor nor revelers nor extortion or shall enter shall inherit the kingdom of God now look at this next verse as such were some of you wow so these people that Paul had witnessed to they came out of that but you're washed you're Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God do you remember my sermon on Acts chapter 15 and on the Galatians Paul was correcting a problem of legalism within the church at Antioch there now Paul is writing in First Corinthians he is writing to correct immorality and writing to correct the sin that was prevalent in that area and don't you love the book of Acts now when we read these books and we'll get to Ephesians a little bit later but when we read these books Galatians the Corinthians we see oh this is who this is written to these people in that area were struggling with these types of things that's why you see Corinthians it's a lot of Correction it says here well in Corinthians IT addresses a lot of immorality IT addresses sleeping around before marriage which is called fornication having relations with someone who's not your spouse which is called adultery the difference there between adultery and fornication effeminate it says here and I'm going through these these uh what he mentions here in First Corinthians effeminate which is homosexuals abusers of their selves with mankind which is also homosexuality idolaters which is worshiping anything other than Jehovah God like in Athens thieves covetousness covetous drunkards you know what all those are revelers reveal here revilers which is actually a a modern word is Slanders Slanders that are causing harm to other with others with their words extortioners none of these shall enter the kingdom of God as such were some of you wow that is the church at Corinth so you can see why this church this letter that's written to these people that we're going to be talking about here why it is so corrective it talks about a woman having long hair it talks about how when men and women divorce and and how that that of a man should treat his wife and a woman should treat her husband it's all of these things that are very very important that they didn't know about because they came from such sin so that is the book of First Corinthians and this who I'm talking about right now is who he is he is writing to and now we're seeing he is starting this church in this Sin City called Corinth are we together so we know now what Paul is facing there and he Paul found a certain Jew this is verse number two yeah there we go thank you and found a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontius lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome and came unto them I I don't have time but I could talk about how that that this Emperor had kicked out all the Jews of Rome it you know where it gives an excellent um description as this is in the church age book but it's it's when this man he kicked out all of these Jews because he thought they're causing problems I'll just I'll just say it for a minute so what happened is we had the First Church of Rome okay and this Church of Rome was all of these just solid Jewish believers and these people these people are like Paul Aquila and Priscilla were part of it they were just solid Jewish people that understood Jehovah they understood Christ but this man goes and he kicks out all of the Jews for this First Church of Rome so they all leave and we see that these other people take their places that don't have that walk with the Lord that these Originals had and they bring in idolatry now this is all in the church age book I I recommend that you read it they are they bring in idolatry and then we have the foundations for the Catholic Church that was a bonus I didn't have that in my nose and found a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontius lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome and came unto them and because he was of the same craft he Abode with them so Paul had the same profession as Aquila and Priscilla and wrought for by their occupation they were tent makers so now just because Paul was a minister didn't mean that he was solely dependent on the Believers to support him the in lean times these Ministers of these rabbis back then they always had another craft that they could fall back on that they could do and that's where Paul he must have been taught that in his hometown of Tarsus and that's what that's what happened here so he goes to this Corinth and he goes to work and I think about me I kind of had a similar um experience to where I used to be I used to I went to college and I and I got I I got this job and and when I came back here I needed something to do I needed a job and the Lord provided a job doing the same thing that I used to do way back when and the same thing here happened to Paul he comes here to Corinth and he's able to to step right in and to work in this profession of tent making now when they had the um when they had the synagogues many times people that were of the same occupation would sit in the same areas so when Paul was probably sitting in an area he that's maybe I don't know it may be how that he met Aquila and Priscilla because they were of the same craft they did the same type of work so we see that that they had this in common and then Aquila and Priscilla this really great couple and they come they come up later on in the scriptures they are just a wonderful wonderful uh couple people but this friendship that they had lasted forever it really lasted until the end we see Aquila and Priscilla we see them in Romans we see them in First Corinthians and we even see them in the second letter that Paul wrote to Timothy which is the last work that he penned that we have record of so the right at the very end of his life Paul even mentions Aquila and Priscilla so they were lifelong friends and they probably met most likely met right here in Corinth and he reasoned and Paul reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks so again as I mentioned we have the Jews and the Greeks in the same church we have the the ones that feared God these are those converts that came in and then we have the the real Jews and when Silas and timothius would come from Macedonia Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ now we all know who Silas is but this timotheus this is Timothy this is someone that Paul writes his letters to when he's in when Timothy's in Ephesus and when they oppose themselves that word opposed it means that they opposed Paul and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads I am clean from henceforth I will go until the Gen unto the Gentiles Paul was fed up with this hypocrisy among the Jews and he said he said if they don't accept now Paul was doing something a Jewish Tradition now you remember in the gospels when Jesus sent out his disciples to preach and to heal the sick do you remember that and he said when you come to a city and they don't accept you he said Shake the Dust off of your sandals Shake the Dust off of your clothes and then go to the next one now what that was is that was a Jewish tradition so what would happen is the Jews they would be in the Gentile area and they would go and then they would come home to their Hometown to their home Jewish country and before they would walk in they would stop at the border they would take off their shoes and they would knock the dirty Gentile dust off of their shoes and then they would put them back on and they would walk these proud stuck up Jews I hate to say it but that's what it was so what Paul is doing here this is a serious insult to the Jews so what Paul is saying is I'm going to shake this legalistic gust off of my clothes and I'm going to go to these more pure Gentiles the exact opposite of what the Jewish tradition was that was that was a slap right there but the boldness of Paul he's he's like well it's what's good for what's saying what's good for the goose is good for the gander and he's like listen you're the ones that are dirty not them so he shakes that nasty dust off of his clothes and then he's going to the Gentiles he's saying I'm done with you with your closed-minded legalistic self-righteous ways finished with it and he departed vents and entered into a certain man's house named justice one that worshiped God whose house was joined hard to the synagogue so Paul is in there and he's debating maybe with these with these Pharisees and and these Jews these legalistic Jews now he is able to if it got rough but for God's serious Paul could just exit stages left right into or stage right whatever this may be right for you but right into this house of justice and go right in there and be safe I think it was a he stayed with Justice and I think who was it that he stayed with last chapter um same thing he stays with this guy Justice is Jason Jason is who it was he stayed in Jason's house and Jason suffered persecution for housing Paul and Christmas the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized so still Paul with that gift of being able to bring the message to the people now Crispus he was you know what there is a let's go to First Corinthians 1 14 real quick let me let me read that so he was he was Paul's convert and it says here I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius so this man right here this Christmas this this leader of of the synagogue Paul actually baptized him I love when the two scriptures come together it's like oh that's that guy just just great but we see in the next verse we see these conversions going on and we see the the Lord moving but we see in the next verse that things aren't all butterflies and daisies in Corinth things are going to go south here in just a minute it was a case in lystra when Paul was stoned it was he was threatened in thessalonica if you remember as we're going through this book The Believers snuck him out of thessalonica in Berea same thing they had to get him out of there pretty much everywhere Paul has been it's been persecution persecution persecution by these Jewish people and Corinth was turning out the same the in the Bible doesn't say it but he had to be having problems because of this next verse the Lord then spake the Lord to Paul in the Night by a vision so there must have been something coming against Paul be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city I think what an encouragement what an encouragement to Paul that the Lord Jesus speaking to his servant and telling him that I'm with you Paul and these people that the Lord is talking about they had no idea that they were about to become Christians they had probably never heard the name of Jesus before in their lives but it was about to happen that there was going to form a Christian Church in the city of Corinth for the Lord he said that I have much people in this city and I would like I wish that I could get sometimes I wish I could get that same Assurance for here in Tucson that there are a lot of people that are God's people that still need to come to him I would love to have that Assurance from God that there are that there are still people hungry for the Lord but I believe this day is is not the day that Paul was in it's just few and far between the Lord hasn't told me but I just have to go on believing that there are more people in our city that can come to God that can come to Christ and he continued there a year and six months he was in Corinth for a long time and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them so even after he shook the dust from His Garment he stayed there and when galio was the deputy of a a Kai AKA the Jews made Insurrection with one Accord against Paul and brought him to the Judgment seat here we go again we know this story well it's happened over and over and over so they they the Jews go and they stir things up and they bring them to the Roman Authority saying this fellow persuadeth man to worship God contrary to the law same thing that these two troublemakers when they came to Antioch they're saying the same thing this guy isn't preaching what our law says he could he should preach and just like Antioch and everywhere else the legalistic Jews do not like Paul's message about Christ and not having to live according to the law they cannot stand that message so they try to get the Roman Authority as I said to arrest Paul why not have worked in Jerusalem with Jesus why wouldn't it work here you know Satan has a bag of tricks and those tricks work pretty well and he takes those tricks and he uses them over and over and over again many times he appeals to the legalistic nature of a religious person and when Paul was now about to open his mouth so he was about to say give himself a defense galio said unto the Jews now Galileo is this ruler said unto the Jews if it were a matter of wrong or Wicked lewdness OU Jews reason would that I should bear with you but if it be a question of words and names and your law look Ye Ye into it for I will be no judge of such matters the same thing very very similar thing that happened to Jesus Remember When pilate had Jesus and he's like oh what am I going to do this is just this is a mess and he says oh hear it I'll send them to Herod and let him deal with it so that's exactly what happens to here here that they're trying to get this man to do their dirty work and now this galio didn't even give Paul a chance to talk now this is where the Lord remember he just promised Paul protect you Now watch how God protects Paul he says if it were a matter of wrong or Wicked lewdness or ye Jews reason would that I should bear with you but if it be a a question of matters and names and of your law look ye into it for I will be no judge in such matters and he galio drove them from the Judgment seat then all the Greek Greeks so now they're all fired up Paul's gone so the Greeks took this guy named sosthenese the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the Judgment seat and Galileo cared for none of those things who is sosthenese where did he come from I thought the other guy was the rule of the synagogue so we have a new ruler of the synagogue somebody must have got kicked out so now we have sustanies and uh sustanese is also in the Bible where is he he's Paul's writing a letter from Corinth and it says and oh yeah it was I think it was first Corinthians first or second Corinthians there Paul is writing back to to the Corinthians and and he's he's saying these things and he says oh ingredients from softon he's our brother and like oh sosthenes you remember him yeah he just disappeared one day oh he's with Paul good I'm glad I'm glad he's in good shape so Paul was Paul this sustines actually traveled with Paul and Paul after this Terry there a good while and then took his leave of the Brethren and sailed thence to Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila having shorn his head in centria for he had a vow now so Paul is leaving Corinth and it seems like he shaves his head but actually he really just cuts his hair and what did this mean that that he he he was shorn because he had a vow well if you look back in the Old Testament you have there's a word that all of us are familiar with and it's called a Nazarite vow and this Nazarite vow means that this this man he wouldn't drink wine he wouldn't do a lot of other things and one of the things that he also wouldn't do is cut his hair now can you think of someone that had a Nazarite vowel just say it Samson right Samson had a Nazarite vow so he let his hair grow long you know somebody else that did Samuel the prophet he also had this vow so they they would go they would go for this period of time when they had this vow and then when their their time was over then they'd get a haircut and that's what happened right here is Paul got a haircut before he left now we think so much because of Paul's message especially to the Galatians but all throughout Paul's message he is saying listen you don't have to live up live up to all these Jewish rules circumcision and and diet and all these things and and really pressing that but if you look at Paul right here Paul greatly reverenced the tradition of the Jews for himself that Nazarite vow Paul held that in a high regard so much that he took this Jewish vow and we see that Paul and and we'll see here in a little bit that he even more reverenced the Jewish the Jewish traditions and when he came to Ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasons with the Jews so now he's out of Corinth and he goes to Ephesus Ephesus is a big city like Corinth and there's a lot of Jews so the so the Jews at at Corinth they disgusted him so much he shook the duff dust off of his clothes and he didn't go back into that synagogue but now he goes to another city oh and he goes right into the synagogue at Ephesus Paul doesn't care he doesn't care if you're Jewish if you come from his background he doesn't care if you're Greek he doesn't care if you're Roman he doesn't care if you've you accept Jehovah or not he doesn't care if you're an idolater Paul wants everyone to come to Christ and he proves that in every city that he preaches look at the variety of people that Paul is preaching to so he comes to this city at Ephesus again there's no Christian churches yet so he goes in and the only places that he has to preach are in these synagogues so when they desired now remember he's in Ephesus when they desired him to tear a longer time with them he consented not wow that's different remember all the other places like get away get away get away kill him you know throw him in jail get rid of them but these people at Ephesus they're like well we want to hear some more so these people the Ephesians had something a little bit a little bit special it seems like to me and if you read the book of Ephesians you'll see that it's a much more advanced letter than the book The Book of Corinthians the books of Corinthians and he goes back to Ephesus later on in fact he goes back to Ephesus in the next chapter in chapter 19. so we talk about a little bit more about the Ephesians in in there but I will say this that the central theme of the book of Ephesians is the Holy Spirit and Paul preaching a deeper Doctrine to these people than he does to the Corinthians and we'll see here in the next chapter and I'll leave that into the capable hands of brother Lyle to show us what message Paul preaches to in to the Ephesians in the next chapter verse number 21. but Paul made them farewell saying I must by all means keep this Feast that cometh in Jerusalem but I will return again to you if God will and he sailed to Ephesus again Paul Paul is showing that he has not forsaken his Jewish roots he was honoring the Jewish tradition of the feast in Jerusalem and when he had landed in caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to Antioch now there's a lot in that verse 22 that may not that may not be all of that apparent it says here and when he landed at caesarea and gone up right Jerusalem he salute to the church and he went down to Antioch now Jerusalem is a high elevation in that part of the world in fact it's about the same elevation as Tucson fact it's about the same latitude as Tucson and if if you go to Israel it actually looks a lot like Arizona looks like this part of the world so Paul so pretty much anywhere in that area you have to go up to Jerusalem and that's why it says here and had gone up it's up in elevation so they went up to Jerusalem now it's odd to me that we don't know more about this visit than a politics it's odd to me that it's like well why isn't a little bit more written we don't know there's nothing significant enough to be recorded in the Bible of this trip but one thing that we can assume is this was a short trip and after he had spent some time there in Jerusalem he departed and went over all the country of galatia and frigia in order strengthening all the disciples and a certain Jew named Apollos born at Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus now this guy is intriguing this man Apollos very very interesting man this is the first right here this is the first we hear about Apollos but he plays a very important role in the message going out to the different churches in First Corinthians Paul mentions that there are fightings among the people you remember that scripture that there's fighting among the people some say that I am of Paul and some Apollos and some Peter so Paul is putting this man Apollos right up there with him and Peter this man must have been very very good at what he did this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John now for those who say baptism isn't important right here you can see that that if you just knew the doctrine and the baptism of the Prophet John the Baptist your understanding was incomplete this man of paulus was from Alexandria Alexandria is in Egypt which is one of the biggest cities in the world and it had an enormous Jewish population it also had some of the best schools on the planet so we can assume that Apollos was probably highly educated in this city in his hometown of Alexandria so somehow the teaching of John the Baptist came to Apollos and he began preaching John's message now he didn't know about anything about the day of Pentecost he didn't know about the Holy Spirit he didn't even know about the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but he is still one of the most gifted preachers that anyone had ever met so he shows up at evidence Ephesus and he starts preaching John the Baptist's message and it goes to show that there is so much about John the Baptist that we don't know he John the Baptist we know that he was a powerful Minister we know that he preached against marriage marriage and divorce when Herod married his brother-in-law's or his brother's wife Philip's wife we know that he preached the Messiah we know that he preached against obviously preached against divorce and he preached against the priests and he preached the Messiah but it must have been a very deep message to have gone as far as John the Baptist message went he must have been really something that we don't read here in the Bible now Paul now Apollos and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took under they took him under them and expounded unto them the way of God more perfectly so Aquila and Priscilla they knew Paul and they knew Christ and they knew the Holy Spirit and they knew baptism so they take one of the most gifted ministers probably in the world at that time he comes into their home and they're probably like hey Apollos you're really good but you need to know a little bit more so they bring him in and they start teaching him and what struck me the most from the scripture is look at the humility of Apollos educated knew the word knew the scriptures knew the Torah knew it better than anyone and here he is with this humble Little Couple comes in and they tell him about Christ and they tell him about the Holy Spirit and he accepts it with all of his heart what a humble man what a good man and when he was disposed in fact brother Branham Likens Apollos to Billy Graham Billy Graham was probably as far as the church world the one of the greatest ministers Christian ministers the world's ever seen and for brother Branham to compare this man of paulus to Billy Graham is a great compliment from him also and when he was disposed to pass unto Ikea the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through Grace for he mightily convinced the Jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ and and we can close if the if the musicians would come so this man Apollos Aquila and Priscilla they explained to him these things and you know like the bereans do you remember the bereans from last week they went and they checked the scriptures I guarantee you Apollos did too so they take they take Apollos takes what Aquila and Priscilla had told him and enlightened him and then he was able to take that Revelation and really present it to the people and there were groups that had heard now Apollos as I said he was all over the place in a great Minister there were groups that had heard Apollos before that he probably had this revelation of the Holy Spirit and of Christ and Paul actually goes and encounters one of these groups and how did Paul handle this when he encountered Apollos this great man comes and he preaches this Gospel of John the Baptist and he converts these people and then Paul comes in and he starts preaching Jesus they're like oh yeah we know and how did Paul handle it brother lie I was going to tell you in his in his sermon on Wednesday it's beautiful Acts chapter 19 is is a wonderful wonderful chapter and Acts chapter 18 17 16 15. oh they're all great I love them all and and I've just been so blessed to be to been going through we've all been blessed to go through these and you see the different people you see from Athens in 17 and you see these just idolaters and Paul is able to speak to them in their language you see that he comes here to Corinth and the most evil Sin City that that you could ever find Paul goes right in jumps in and forms a church right there absolutely beautiful the gifts of this great man the Apostle Paul God bless you brothers and sisters continue
