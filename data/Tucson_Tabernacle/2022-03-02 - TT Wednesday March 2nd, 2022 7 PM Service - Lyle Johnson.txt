the beginning of the season of lent the focus of this season is about repentance and prayer fasting reflection denial of self looking forward to easter the resurrection of jesus the confirmation of our faith our hope our joy as always i'm grateful for an opportunity to be gathered with you whether i'm sitting there next to my sweetheart or or if the lord chooses to put me up here but if we could join our hearts together in prayer one more time lord jesus we're so grateful we're so honored that we can be here your children in this day in this hour in this place and in this time lord i pray that you would forgive me lord that you would get me out of the way nobody has come here to listen to lyle johnson if if i'm the person that's speaking lord we should just shut off the microphone and

here someone that's screaming someone that's listening lord jesus we're gathered here to worship you above all lord you're our savior you're our king you're the one that we love lord you're the ruler of our soul and lord tonight i can't help but think of the problems that are happening in ukraine and pray lord that we have brothers and sisters over there lord they're not only there we've got brothers and sisters in belarus and in russia lord and throughout europe and lord it's not just our brothers and sisters but the human suffering that's going on lord i pray that you would have your will and all of this we thank you in jesus precious name amen please be seated i'll have you stand up again to read the opening verse but i i just you know my heart this evening is heavy because of what's happening in europe it's nothing new dictators and despots make war wreak destruction cause havoc misery every generation or so in every part of the world such evil has occurred throughout history in america we're often isolated from these events we send our soldiers overseas to keep the wars over there so they don't come on our shores we see about what's happening in ukraine and we think oh my this is so sad and then we switch off the news and think what are we cooking for supper tonight we go on with our lives but the people there can't switch it off they have to live through it but we have to remember we're in satan's eden what we're witnessing are the fruits of sin of unbelief but it doesn't make them less painful to endure we're often reminded to look up to expect a rapture a carrying away of the faithful that will witness the resurrection and shortly after slip away but it's much more than a last-minute rescue or evacuation plan for us to avoid the unimaginable physical spiritual psychological toll for those who remain on earth and the midst of what we call the great tribulation we need to ensure that our motive for being a part of that is pure it's to be with the lord not to escape destruction we must have compassion on those that suffer this evening i want to encourage each of you as well as warn you and remind you please stand with me now as we read tonight's topic verses we'll read two passages together first from the gospel of luke chapter 4 starting at verse 25. the setting is nazareth in a synagogue on a sabbath being handed a scroll jesus has just read from isaiah chapter 61. everyone's waiting for him to comment on this reading it may have been the expected reading from the prophets with what's called the half torah on that particular sabbath or not we don't know i i was unable to find it being part of any half torah reading in modern jewish liturgy i i was looking to find out what time of year was this but regardless it's what he did read to them that day now you've got it in the king james in your hand i'm going to read this particular couple of verses in the niv jesus is now addressing that congregation he says i assure you there were many widows in israel in elijah's time when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout all the land that extended beyond the borders of israel yet elijah was not sent to any of them not any not one not even one of the many suffering widows in israel instead where did you elect you go but to a widow and zerefat and the region of sidon to a foreigner and a foreign land well let's read the account that jesus was referring to if found of course in the old testament jesus bible the tanakh please turn in your bible to first kings the 17th chapter and i'll use the king james version to make it easy to follow and this portion is a bit lengthy so please feel free to be seated the context is this elijah had recently declared a drought that would last three and a half years he'd been living next to a small brook called terret a tributary of the jordan ravens had bringing been bringing him bits of food to eat but now due to that very drought the brook and dried up let's join elijah there the word of the lord came unto elijah saying arise get thee to zeraphat which belongeth to zidane now that's in modern-day lebanon it's well outside the boundaries of the portion of canaan that was prescribed to the uh to abraham and dwell there this isn't a short visit this isn't a weekend meeting you're going to have there elijah you're going to live there for a while behold i've commanded more ravens no no i've commanded a widow woman there and there's no indication that this wooden woman was jewish if you recall jezebel was a daughter of the king of this same zidane and she was married to ahab the king of israel behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee he's spoken as if he's already commanded this widow woman but we find out in a couple of verses she didn't seem to know anything about this so he arose and went to zarephath i'm going to be a while here please go ahead and take your seeds well where is theraphat where is zeiden oh well here's a map this map gives us an idea of the distances it's a journey of at least 80 miles from that brook to sidon it's probably more like a hundred if you're not being carried by a raven and have to go on the ground elijah had to travel across it by foot in a hot dry dusty place no uber no buses no chariot or donkey walking alone at least four days probably six or more and he was the guy that most people blamed for that drought and for that famine after all he'd called for it and that was the official government position king ahab called elijah the one who troubles israel when they met at the end of the drought so as elijah journeyed the people he encountered were probably not very friendly they didn't physically attack him they realized he was the only one that could end the drought and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering sticks small dry branches from parched trees good kindling easy to burn thanks to that drought and he called to her now he must have looked a sight trudging through a hundred miles without a bath tired sore dirty smelly scruffy at best pitiful really he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water and a vessel that i may drink throat dry voice scratchy pat hadn't rained in a long time water was precious and here's this widow woman gathering sticks not somebody gathering them for her not even her son maybe he was too infirmed to help or too weak or too young she may have been fairly young herself perhaps having lost her husband to the effects of that very drought and subsequent famine we we don't know and as she was going to fetch this drink probably taking pity on this half dehydrated stranger that's asking for help he called to her and said and bring me please a morsel of bread with that water in your hand bread water jesus identified himself with both of these and she said as the lord thy god notice she knew of the god of israel but did not identify him as her god or our god as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake i don't have any bread but a handful of meal in a barrel a little oil in a cruise and and look i'm gathering just two sticks here that i may go and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah acknowledging her desperate plight said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and and bring it unto me and after make for you and your son she might have rolled her eyes at this point how coarse and unfeeling to demand from the last morsel from a starving widow he's treating her a bit like a servant or a slave seems to be dismissing her need in favor of his own i can see her drawing her breath getting ready to lash out in some manner why why are you the very nerve but but before she could object he goes on to say for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not go empty neither shall the cruce of oil fail until the day that the lord sends rain upon the earth talk about a test of her faith and obedience she's being asked to risk everything i think of the widow tossing her mites in the temple treasury she decided that she and her boy were going to die she was at the end of the rope she'd given up hope but it's still an act of supreme faith in the word of a prophet who had called the drought and thus the famine in the first place and now she is being asked to help him i think she may have felt a bit like ananias in acts 9 he was told to go pray for saul's healing the very guy who had caused so much trouble to the believers in jesus probably while he was celebrating with others that the lord had struck down this menace to the faith an answer to their prayers to stop this demon of a man hallelujah thank you god for answering our prayers shutting down this man's soul praise god you can be sure they were praying for that and what does god tell him i want you to go help him oh no no i don't want you to just help him i want you to heal him well let's get back to elijah and she went and did according to the saying of elijah notice he said go make something for me and bring it to me and then go and make something don't make something for all three of us right so what happens she does that and what happens when she goes back there's more meal and more oil than there was when she left he and her house did he many days uh oh can you imagine the gossip that nasty israelite desperado elijah fleeing prosecution from his government he's moved in with the widow larkin they're shacked up together in her late husband's house how shameful of them both right people are people reading on the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruce of oil fail according to the word of elijah no no the word of the lord which he spake by elijah it wasn't elijah's word it was god's word spoken through his prophet somehow she recognized it she might have heard of elijah but probably never met him before had no idea what he looked like he didn't walk up and say here's my here's my id here's my driver's license check the picture it says right there elijah tishbyte right no no she he didn't have any picture id she had no idea who he was from from a wanted poster that might have been in the post office or something there was no facebook posting these are sobering verses not ones that make you want to jump up and shout or dance or cry for joy they portray human misery suffering and god's seeming hardness to ignore the plight of so many of his chosen the sons and daughters of israel instead he sends his prophet to help and be sustained by a gentile of the people of the hated jezebel consider the situation in elijah's time elijah was commanded by god to invoke a drought ultimately lasted three and a half years they didn't have deep wells no irrigation pumps no grocery stores or frozen food lockers no container ships plying the waters of the mediterranean to bring food to them from distant lands no desalination plants no railroads no 18 wheelers on interstate highways we've not experienced famine in america in our lifetimes the temporary shortages of some foods and other supplies in our supermarkets at the onset of the pandemic we're nothing we really have no concept of how devastating such weather extremes were for an agrarian society largely based on subsistence farming we're only just now starting to experience the first of a crescendo of calamities due to weather extremes as the earth's climate changes floods and drought brother dan right wildfires hurricanes tornadoes for these people and these were people they're not imaginary these are not fictional people from a storybook or some character in a hollywood movie these people it was a period of extreme hardship sickness death jesus audience was familiar with this sort of thing they existed under the oppressive heal of roman occupation and he reminded them that shabbat of the story of elijah and the widow now remember ahab was a wicked king there was widespread idolatry and lack of faith in god at that time and notice though elijah had been sustained probably for well over a year and possibly as many as three by the miraculous wheat and oil through that widow he despaired that he was alone in israel maybe the fact that she was a foreigner helped feed that despondency we soon find him hiding out in a cave let's read from first kings 19 familiar passage we read and it was so when elijah heard it heard what a still small voice in the midst of earthquakes and winds and all sorts of things he's in this cave so he wraps his face in his mantle and he went out and stood at the entering into the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what are you doing here elijah having a pity party are we and and he said i've been very jealous for the lord of posts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars slain thy prophets with a sword i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away well the lord responds to elijah gives him directions what to do to anoint certain guy to be king and so forth and then skipping down to verse 18 he gently reminds him of something something that he just may not have been aware of yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed down to all every mouth which hath not kissed him i want us to consider those seven thousand tonight that's the title of tonight's message the seven thousand they were faithful to the lord they kept his word in a time of apostasy in the midst of false teaching compromise idolatry with the government led by ahab and jezebel whose policies encouraged them to leave the faith of the bible it's a book of fables and contradictions and instead to pursue pleasure if it feels good do it forget lent it's carnival time very like today here in america in tucson yet these faithful ones had to endure the drought brought on by the apostasy of the nation of which they were apart even though they had no say in the matter they lived right they did right they worshiped the lord endured scoffing ridicule persecution didn't elijah list among his complaints that the nation had slain the prophets and torn down the altars yet somehow these had survived or at least 7 000 of them did perhaps there were more for some had passed away perished through that three and a half years we don't know we're not told but we can be sure there was widespread disease suffering misery despair and death and added to all of that was this drought this famine no rain meant no crops no crops meant no harvest there was no preceding time of plenty there was no joseph storing grain no food death by starvation can you hear them crying in despair god why are you doing this to me i've kept your word i've held my head high in the midst of all this idolatry why am i being punished why did you command your prophet to seal up the heavens lord i'm so hungry my wife and children are starving what have i done how can i appease you david said he'd never seen the righteous forsaken remaking bread but lord i am begging you for bread help me god help me i can hear their cries they're real people it's not realistic to think that the seven thousand somehow avoided suffering that their plots of land miraculously had rain and their apostate neighbors did not they weren't in goshen they were in the land of promise they were obedient to the lord and they were suffering we sometimes think of abraham's pleading for lot in sodom i imagine they did too in genesis 18 abraham said oh let not the lord be angry i will speak yet but this once maybe ten will be found there and the lord said i will not destroy it for ten's sake and the lord went his way as soon as he left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place we know that the lord rescued four there weren't even ten there were four yet he pulled them out before destruction fell and here we're not talking about ten or four we're talking about seven thousand but abraham's ten speaks to us of the of the of the rapture of the catching away being pulled out of the destruction the final destruction that falls on our planet in a baptism of fire but elijah 7 000 i think speaks to us today of our present time of the church ages of what we often refer to as the last days the time that leads up to that rapture let's turn to ii timothy chapter 3 paul's telling timothy this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous posters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such to turn away and we know we're living in those very times that paul warned of not just of a general unsaved population but also among those that profess to be part of god's family and not just here but not just now we believe we're in the last the seventh age of the church we have no idea how long that age will last it could end before our service concludes this evening it might go on for years or decades no one knows when brother branham expected 1977 to bring the end other places he expressed that he believed would never see the conclusion of the 20th century so the point isn't when it'll happen when god deems it to be the right moment he doesn't owe us an explanation he doesn't need our approval so then what is the point the point is that we need to always be ready weren't those words brother green's final admonition to us the last dream he shared with us be ready be ready don't get ready for the rapture brother while certainly but also for our final breath whenever that may be meanwhile expect testing character building and evaluation but aren't we in the last days aren't we told the rapture could be any moment now yes yes and i believe we're very close but there's a balance to that the church has always been in the last days the day of pentecost was in the last days as peter quoted joel regarding the infilling of the holy spirit acts chapter 2. jesus disciples tried to pin this time down when they asked him recorded in matthew 24 and as jesus sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world i wonder why human nature is such that we always want to predict tomorrow what's the weather going to be tomorrow we're told one of the strategies of satan is to get us and despair about yesterday or be so worried or focused on tomorrow that we do nothing today the serenity prayer of alcoholics anonymous comes to mind god grant me the serenity the peace to accept the things i cannot change like yesterday the courage to change the things i can today now and the wisdom to know the difference so the disciples were just being human they wanted an inside track on the future when will these things be what did jesus reply what were the signs deception wars rumors of wars famines disease earthquakes persecution betrayal things that have always been as long as humans have been on planet earth or at least as long as there have been more than three in other words life will simply continue until it doesn't as it was in the days of noah that's why he says it comes as a thief in the night regarding the when he told them of that day and hour knoweth no man not the angels of heaven but my father only i couldn't tell you because i don't know and he says a few verses later watch therefore be ready for you know not what hour your lord doth come now the disciples were persistent after the resurrection and just before the ascension they asked him again and he told them again acts 1 6 when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times are the seasons which the father had to put in his own power not just the day or the hour but not even the times or the seasons that's why things didn't end in 1977 that's why we're here in the 21st century it's why all christians from the apostolic days until us assembled here this very evening have been convinced the lord jesus return in their lifetime i'm not saying that as a scoffer i believe that he is coming soon and he's certainly coming sooner than he was in their day but going back to matthew 24 with all the warnings and indicators in his reply to their question of when jesus put it this way therefore because these signs these events that i just described to you are ongoing be he also be always ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh in other words knowing the signs of the end doesn't actually prepare you for it according to jesus it'll take you by surprise if you're alive when it occurs the ye that he's speaking to are his closest followers his disciples the very ones who asked and to whom he's addressing his reply are you one of his followers if so then jesus is speaking to you he's speaking to me here and now in this verse therefore be ye also ready we must always be ready not just preparing we should be about our father's business we should be redeeming the time dying to self loving one another praying worshiping gathering together but notice he included a promise to us in all of this an exceedingly reassuring one in verse 13 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved endure what until the end of what we'll get to that the fact that those close to him asked jesus these questions indicates that they had forgotten or perhaps were ignoring something he'd emphasized to them earlier back in matthew 6 he told them he talked about the birds of the air he talked about the flowers of the field he told us that your heavenly father knows what you have need of he said but here's what you're supposed to be doing seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you don't seek an order to collect the added things it's hypocrisy check your motive check your objective take therefore because of this take no thought for the morrow don't ask when shall these things be for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness well let's read that promise again this time from mark's account he shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved what does it mean to endure if we you know look up the greek and go to strong's it's he's going to tell us that this particular word means to remain to undergo to bear trials to have fortitude to persevere abide endure patiently suffer terry behind and modern colloquial english we'd say to hang in there webster defines endure as an intransitive verb to continue in the same state like the style endured for centuries kind of like my tie i suppose to remain firm under suffering or misfortune without yielding or as a transit of an action verb to undergo especially without giving in to suffer to regard with acceptance or tolerance for example he could not endure noisy children or wiles sermons what about to the end again from strong's it means to set out for a definite point or goal the conclusion of an act or state termination endure to the end whether the end is the rapture whether the end is passing to that other dimension through the doorway of death we all look to the raptures the catching away the final act but we shouldn't think of it as a way out we in our lifetimes may not be caught up like elijah we may have to endure through the build up to it like the seven thousand this situation this this endurance it's not a bride versus church thing it's life it's in living today not in yesterday not in tomorrow paul told timothy 2 timothy 4 he said for the time will come when they will not endure or put up with or receive sound doctrine sound doctrine thank you brother frank for this i really enjoyed reading it sound doctrine but after their own lusts their own desires they shall heap to themselves teachers having itching ears they want to hear what they want to hear the way they want to hear it don't confuse me with the facts my mind's made up and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables to unsound doctrine the truth is being proclaimed but they'll refuse to listen to it instead they listen to fables and deep revelations and believe them paul's warning timothy that someone in the church would find sound doctrine too hard to bear unwilling to endure the life that obedience to the gospel requires the people would drift to whatever they found that eased their discomforts while still claiming to be following the truth and they'll find heaps of those teachers they won't be hard to find and not just in some distant future like our day paul expected it to be during timothy's lifetime remember paul wasn't consciously saying i'm writing the bible and these people are going to be reading it 2000 years he's pending a letter of advice and warning and encouragement to one that he looked upon as his own son warning him encouraging him but there's another element of endurance that paul shares with him found in the next verse watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of my ministry if i could paraphrase that he's saying timothy my boy you're gonna have to put up with all this nonsense and hurt and rejection but hang in there buddy be faithful to your calling in spite of it and in the face of it don't give up never waver be steadfast endurance implies patience hebrews 12 a very familiar passage wherefore seeing we also i can pass to bout with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight the sin which death so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us i'd like to emphasize this just a little bit taking from various translations the king james the niv the complete jewish bible nlt nasb amplified bible this is paul's conclusion after laying out a list of those who we often call the heroes of faith in chapter 11. therefore then since we are surrounded by such a huge cloud of witnesses who have borne testimony to the truth let us strip off and throw aside every encumbrance every unnecessary weight rid ourselves of every obstacle everything that hinders every impediment everything that slows us down and that sin which so readily and deftly and cleverly clings to and entangles us easily hampers our forward movement trips us up let us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence perseverance the god-appointed course of the race that set before us we spoke about this race a while ago it's your individual race we aren't promised coddling we're not promised physical comfort we're promised comforting by the comforter the holy spirit in our lives the coddled don't need comforting and encouragement the suffering the weary the wounded they do do you have times in your life when you're in a cave perhaps of self-doubt or fear the lord comes and asks what are you doing here lyle i've been there many times i'd like to share a testimony with you one that i've not shared before i was drafted into the army in december 1972. in mid-1973 i was ordered to fort campbell kentucky i was assigned to b troop second squadron 17th calvary a component of the 101st airborne division the screaming eagles a very pregnant heather and i along with our 11 month old son samuel drove to kentucky we were desiring fellowship and knew of no message churches in the area somehow we ended up corresponding with sister helen borders and she sent us a letter and go down highway 68 towards elkton when you come to a quarry on the right look on the left there's a little road that leads behind mr case's barn and you'll find a church back there okay i was at this time feeling like i had failed the lord people i had confidence in were convinced that i shouldn't be in the army and they let me know it i was feeling very downcast this is mid-1973 1977 is hanging over our heads there's three and a half years of uncertainty is is the rapture going to be in 1977 or three and a half years sooner than that or since 1977 being january 1st or december 31st or was i an outcast has god rejected me i'm ripped away from the congregation and stuck in western kentucky somewhere with a bunch of soldiers well at that tiny country church pastored at that time by a brother billy fuller we met a family that was driving over a hundred miles each way to have fellowship paul and mary risley some of you may remember them when they were here in the 70s and 80s and their two young children paul and debbie they had only recently come into contact with and embraced the message how did that happen paul's dad psy risley was a spiritual man a solid christian for many decades and the lord spoke to him in dreams think of joel 2 28. for example when the grizzlies first received a few tape recordings of brother branham's sermons they were wondering about it something excited them but they were this is is this you so they talked to psy they shared with him so i had a dream and he told them you'll find the truth so and so miles south of booneville indiana now i don't recall the number but it was precise it was an exact number so they drove to the town square of booneville where lincoln studied law and started driving due south monitoring the car's odometer at that precise distance when the odometer had the exact reading the precise reading that matched psy's dream they stopped and looked where they were they were at the foot of their own driveway in yankee town indiana where they had just received the tapes those were the kinds of spiritual dreams that cy risley had well a couple of weeks after we met the grizzlies at brother fuller's church so i came to a sunday service with paul and mary and he acted a little odd when he met me collapsed my hands became a little emotional remember i was in a spiritual valley at this time doubting struggling fearful do i even have the holy ghost what am i doing here in the army i was drafted i didn't join lord you could have kept me out and people that i have confidence and said that i shouldn't be in here is this punishment why didn't you do that lord am i an outcast i was struggling turns out syde recently had a dream might have even been the night before i don't remember exactly though he had never met me he saw in that dreamy young man dressed in a certain patterned plaid shirt brother aaron and the lord told him he has the right spirit and that sunday morning the first time we ever met i was wearing the shirt that he'd seen in that dream well you can imagine we were both a little emotional when i heard that it still brings emotions when i recall that moment the overwhelming flood of reassurance i needed the encouragement a few weeks later i'd be summoned late at night three o'clock in the morning the phone rings report to fort campbell there's a war the yom keeper awarded just started and we were in the rotation to intervene if that was required god saw fit to encourage me just when i needed it when my barrel of meal seemed empty my crews of oil nearly dry and at the same time help and encourage another a few months later as sly lay in his deathbed heather and i were privileged to spend an hour or two with him singing as he waved his hands to the song that we sang a bittersweet time precious memories i felt like i was part of that seven thousand even now when i get discouraged when i think or i know that i'm just not doing my part doubting wondering i sometimes recall that sunday morning in the summer of 1973 when i met psy risley and i still draw encouragement from it not to dwell in the past or on my faults and weaknesses and failings but comfort and strength to carry on to get up to get out of the cave to continue to be part of that seven thousand there's other personal testimonies i'd like to share with you maybe over time i'll have that opportunity i'm sure many of you have similar experiences something that when you recall in moments of doubt or despair you can say like paul wrote to timothy i know whom i have believed i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day my brother and my sister we are called to endure to be steadfast to watch and pray to be like paul part of that seven thousand and that's what was on my heart to share with you this evening to encourage you to hold fast and to be ready always to be ready jesus words he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved thinking of jesus words i'm reminded of a song the race by lanny wolfe the chorus is the part i remember the best i'll put the words up i'm no singer i'll just read them but maybe after the second verse we can try and sing the chorus together some of you may know it certainly better than i i tried to keep it a bit short tonight so we could worship for a while isn't that what he wants from us to draw nearer many souls have started out to run this race many feet have stumbled trying hard to keep the pace at times my steps have grown so weary as i watch others pass me by it makes me wonder who will make it is there hope for such as i it's not the one who runs the swiftest nor the one who shines for a day but the one who endures to the end he he shall be saved a crown of life is waiting for those who make it in those who've run the race with patience casting off the weights of sin it doesn't matter when we've started or how long the race has been it's the end that's so important i just got to make it in not the one who runs the swiftest nor the one who shines for a day but the one who endures to the end he shall be saved maybe we can try and sing that not the one who runs the swiftest nor the one who shines for a day but the one who endureth to the end he [Music] he shall be saved not the one who runs the swiftest nor the one who shines for a day but the one who endorsed the end he [Music] [Music] nor the one who shines but the one who endureth [Music] you know a race it's always to the one who crosses the line first that gets the prize but when you run as a team making cross-country it's the five that cross the line with a combined score and the higher the score the lower the place or the further back because if you run first second third fourth and fifth and you add those numbers that's the lowest amount numbers and if you run five through ten well you've got higher numbers and that's the running that i did was cross country so we'd start looking to see who was placing where maybe they weren't winning but if he could get past that one he could get our team to win and that was a different type of race but to each individual has been given a call and a place and a race to run but we can encourage one another we can strengthen one another we can say don't give up come on keep running i like that testimony the preciseness of god right in front of your driveway but i didn't have my phone on but set it down next to me there and it turned on and somebody sent me this and it's joshua 23 14. they sent it to me before service i'm looking at the time now if we can get that up joshua 23 14. [Music] let's am i reading it right here [Music] okay you know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the lord your god gave you has failed every promise has been fulfilled not one has failed without fail god went to the very end to make sure it was all completed and by a show of hands who is here in 77 at the meetings few of you i was here as young men and the fear that swept the congregation in that service as a brother stood up and spoke in tongues and another one prophesied saying we're down to or this was december 18th through 24th with the meetings and the brothers got up and and said this is the last few days you better be ready you better get ready now we're down to our last couple days before the lord comes because of what brother randomly said about 77 and what people took it to be and mean and somewhere between what was it 125 135 people somewhere in that place were rebaptized or baptized that night including myself by the fear that set upon us now after the brother finished interpreting the message brother graham stood up behind the pope and he said brother i judge you enthused but not inspired but the fear had run through the church there doesn't have to be fear but there is an assurance that god keeps his word and you and i are just to run this race to the end if he says make me [Music] give me a cup of water and make me that bread he says and yours will not fail do what he says to do he says to do because this scripture just they send it to me and it says he has not failed on a single one of his promises i know i can testify and down in hard times god has spoken to me to me because he knows who i am and each one of you should have that assurance in your life that god knows who you are your place and he'll talk to you whether it's through somebody else speaking to you what god wants you when he gives you a dream or he personally comes and visits you i'll testify will you testify with me that god would do that for you amen stand on this stand [Music] i i know what's been in my heart for the last week or so [Music] and that's just to take what god has said and stand on that and it's the words that go he did will you that's what's been ringing out he did will you take them when he said and he he nailed there at gethsemane and he said father is there a way to go around this what's about to happen can we do this a different way and then he humbled himself he says but not my will but thy will be done and then he said i he had his faith steadfast to jerusalem and that's just what he did will you that's what's been asking me will you do the same thing let's just bow our hands lord we're in a time and [Music] part of our our cry and our desire is even so come quickly lord jesus but sometimes i wonder if we do that as an escape as uh i don't want to deal with this anymore just get me out of here but as i was you know lord as i was thinking that the other day and i was just saying lord when is that cry how is that cry how should it be made because the scripture says even so come quickly lord jesus but then my heart went what but what about those who have not heard what about those who have have not made their heart right lord to give them an opportunity also to be ready but lord help us to be ready let each one of us hear under the sound of brother lyle's voice that you used to speak this today to be ready to be prepared to endure to the end lord sometimes we just throw our hands up and say i just don't want to do it anymore lord and you know that because you even asked the father there was a way to go around this but you said not my will but thy will be done may that be our purpose in our heart today we pray in jesus christ's name amen let's worship him he's worthy of all honor all glory we sing that song i bless your name i bless your name [Music] i bless your name if you are i give you praise you are the truth [Music] i bless your name [Music] all inside prayed [Music] and they were free my bless your name i bless your name i give you honor [Music] [Applause] [Music] i bless your name i bless your name some midnight if should i go this way should i do it like that how's

doing and i give you praise and honor for it to god [Applause] [Music] for the things he has done [Music] he has saved me by his power he has [Applause] [Music] for the things he has done brother peter her sister was playing brother peter had to sing that song i'd rather have jesus what a fitting song in all of this i'd rather have him above all and anything you're safe in him he has everything taken care of covered when he cried it is finished it was finished i'd rather [Music] is [Music] oh i'd rather have jesus [Music] insane [Music] have jesus is [Music] you're talking about your lover you're talking about your lord and savior you're talking about the one who gave his life for your singing to him is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we have to yield to his bleeding [Music] yes i'd rather have jesus than anything that is [Music] king surrender this to that king give all of this to that king [Music] is [Music] to think of that little widdle lady with her little child two two sticks but the ram said that was a cross she didn't know that she's got two sticks to make that last little fire but then she found out that every need supplied every needs applied healing cleansing and sweet peace inside [Music] every [Music] supply healing cleansing and sweet peace every sing it in thankfulness sing it as a praise to him say lord you've met every need is [Music] and sweet peace [Music] all is when all is well we have heard the message alone and all his words is a place of perfect rest behind this [Music] is [Music] all is well [Music] we have heard the message alone and all his words there is a place behind [Music] to think that the high priest was the only one that could go behind the interval and the people stood on the outside waiting to see if it was going to be accepted but today he's rent the villain too and you can go right in and fellowship with him and have that peace in a time of trouble in a time of storm in a time of drought in a time of of everything and your cruise is about this much in your meals about this and you look and he says go ahead and eat it'll never be it'll never fail walked in the manner was still fresh walk in in errands of bud erin's rod headbutted the shekinah glory of god was there and he's invited you come on in that's a place of rest right there i guess we could let you go home now but it's been good to be here it's been good to be here to know that in a storm in a trouble in a heartache in all that's happening and in no way are we looking at the at the people that are suffering and say well it's their fault no your heart better say lord have mercy on them as you had mercy on me as he looked over jerusalem and said how oft had i wanted you drug but you would not he said but he gave up he even told cain if you'd done like your brother you would have a chance that's the heart of god that should be our heart also lord we thank you for today maybe today for somebody at work or somebody's school a situation came up today and there was a disappointment there was something that fell apart something that didn't work or maybe just didn't come out the way we thought it should come out or we had hoped for but you oversaw it all lord there's not even a bird a sparrow that falls out of the sky it says you're not that you're not aware of it lord we serve a living god not a statue not some like those 400 prophets that were screaming and yelling trying to get bale's attention but you answered it fire lord jesus you're still the same yesterday today and forever lord may each one get into that rest father that rest that all is well with you lord jesus and run the race that is set before us let all the encumbrance let all the weight let all that drag all that let us set it aside and run
