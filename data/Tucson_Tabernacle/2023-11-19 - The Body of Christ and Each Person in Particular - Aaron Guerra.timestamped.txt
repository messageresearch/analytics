[40:55] that and the joy of the
[40:59] grandparents and the parents to see
[41:01] their children
[41:02] baptized it was it was worth it just to
[41:05] to see somebody the the joy of that and

[41:10] had we had the opportunity for this and
[41:12] now for them so he's working in in um

[41:34] one as we were hearding the other day
[41:36] brother Dan was speaking of that
[41:37] prodigal
[41:39] son but the father when he was out
[41:42] looking down he said could this be the
[41:43] day he's coming
[41:45] back and it's just what a what a
[41:48] wonderful thing and and this
[41:51] morning brother Eli sharing his heart
[41:55] and he said let's open into the book of
[41:57] Ephesians and I said oh my he's going to
[41:59] preach my message it just seems to to be
[42:02] that how often that happens you go along
[42:04] the same line but I thought the spirit
[42:07] of the Lord moved and and it just it was
[42:09] a wonderful time this this this morning
[42:13] and I appreciate him that that he would
[42:16] come and and visit with us not only
[42:19] visit but be part of us and be at home
[42:21] with us and we would make him welcome
[42:24] and he said we're two or three are
[42:26] gathering in his name he'll be there in
[42:29] in the midst of them and without him
[42:31] it's just another gathering it's just
[42:34] it's could I say it's just noise it's
[42:36] just you know those but when he's here
[42:38] it's lifegiving
[42:40] lifechanging God working show appreciate
[42:43] that and I went I was talking to brother
[42:47] Daniel about this
[42:49] before before he uh he left on his trip
[42:53] and I was talking to Daniel and I said
[42:56] said you know and sister marily I said
[42:58] brother Daniel said on his WhatsApp
[43:01] message he said oh I sure wish you all
[43:03] were
[43:04] here and I said oh I'd like to see what
[43:06] sister Stephanie had to say about that
[43:08] one and sister marily said she probably
[43:11] would have said yes bring them
[43:13] all and it's it's good to to have
[43:16] fellowship with one another and and to
[43:18] want to be around one another you know
[43:20] when when a person has to be by
[43:22] themselves all the time and maybe you
[43:24] get used to it and you learn to do but
[43:27] you know when there's another one to
[43:29] help you along then there's another one
[43:30] to encourage you when there's somebody
[43:32] else to pick up the slack and kind of
[43:35] like to go in that direction and I told
[43:36] Brother Daniel I would something been in
[43:39] my heart for a while and just kind of
[43:41] looking at some things about the body of
[43:43] Christ and each member in
[43:46] particular and and each part that each
[43:49] person plays and you
[43:52] know some parts of the body some parts
[43:54] that are not evident things that are
[43:56] hidden you don't know much about them
[44:00] until they don't
[44:02] work until something goes wrong with
[44:05] that part then you're suddenly aware of
[44:08] it and
[44:10] so as Paul really addresses this this in
[44:13] the book of Ephesians and also in
[44:16] Corinthians but today just just a base
[44:19] to lay down what Paul says starting in
[44:22] in
[44:24] Ephesians and we we'll go with that
[44:27] direction but
[44:29] also some things that brother brandham
[44:31] said concerning that from the message
[44:34] the voice of the sign preached in
[44:38] 64 and I believe the brothers have
[44:42] that to put that up you can read it
[44:48] along it says Moses no one else could
[44:52] take his
[44:54] place no one else could do the job he
[44:57] was ordained to do it and Brethren
[45:00] sister if you've got eternal life you
[45:03] were ordained to do a certain
[45:06] thing now watch what he says maybe a
[45:09] good housewife maybe something else but
[45:12] nobody can take your place God has made
[45:17] you a place don't try to take somebody
[45:19] else's place that's carnal
[45:23] impersonations see shows that the
[45:25] there's something wrong with you so what
[45:28] you are just be what you are just
[45:32] exactly don't be nothing
[45:35] else and uh I I was thinking about that
[45:38] and I was
[45:39] talking a little bit we're talking with
[45:41] my wife and I said you know just some
[45:43] things are not noticed some some people
[45:45] come in they just seem to be so
[45:47] quiet but if none of the musicians
[45:49] showed up
[45:51] today nobody to play the piano nobody to
[45:54] song Lead everybody's like where are
[45:57] they but there's some folks that come in
[45:59] and out you don't hardly see them you
[46:01] don't you don't hear much about
[46:04] them but they're still part of the body
[46:06] of Christ they still have a
[46:09] point you know if you look at I was
[46:12] talking to uh um someone who knew a
[46:15] little bit I said and and they said I
[46:18] said you know you see the the fuselage
[46:20] of an airplane or maybe the body of the
[46:21] boat especially the older man they were
[46:24] all
[46:24] riveted
[46:26] now they can do some stuff differently
[46:29] today but back then it was all rivets
[46:31] and every rivet was
[46:33] necessary to maintain the full the full
[46:36] value the full structure the strength of
[46:38] that of that whatever it
[46:41] was and yeah you can fly without missing
[46:44] one here and missing one
[46:46] there but eventually as more and more
[46:49] begin to miss that's when you begin to
[46:52] have problems situations of things not
[46:55] not coming you know working together and
[46:58] and so some things may seem more
[47:00] important the others more
[47:03] noticeable but what is going on behind
[47:05] the scene usually is what's keeping that
[47:07] one that's noticeable going brother
[47:10] Brandon makes a statement and he says do
[47:12] you know what keeps me going do you know
[47:14] what the success of my my meetings are
[47:17] is those that are behind the curtain
[47:18] praying those who were praying last
[47:20] night those who spent time on their
[47:22] knees nobody knew it but God did
[47:26] and then the the what would began to
[47:29] take place it was that which those that
[47:31] had asked God to come and he began to
[47:34] minister and and you know there was a
[47:38] prophet in this age in this time who God
[47:42] said this is hear ye
[47:45] him now the brother brandom said the
[47:48] gift is not for me he said the gift is
[47:52] for you he would be standing there and
[47:55] the prayer pray line weak and tired and
[47:58] and struggling and the people would be
[48:01] going through being healed but he said
[48:03] the gift is not for me the gift is for
[48:07] you and again like some gifts are very
[48:11] evident and other things you don't know
[48:14] until they're not
[48:16] there in the message
[48:19] why brother B says I want to get on that
[48:22] this week if I could how that one Tri to
[48:26] impersonate another you can never do
[48:29] that God never made two people alike you
[48:32] just got you just go the way the Holy
[48:35] Spirit leads you we might take the
[48:37] millions that's in the world and not two
[48:40] of them got the same thumb print that's
[48:43] right God made them different he's a god
[48:47] of variety he made them different and
[48:50] don't try to impersonate the next fellow
[48:53] you do what God tells you to do and stay
[48:55] with
[48:56] it because there because there's no one
[48:59] in heaven or in Earth can take your
[49:01] place God Made You for a purpose stay
[49:05] with
[49:06] that but sometimes we look at what
[49:08] somebody else is doing and it just seems
[49:10] to be more glorious more out front
[49:13] more but God made you the way you are to
[49:17] do what he wants you to
[49:22] do
[49:24] yesterday or my wife went to see sister
[49:26] Mercy somano she had wanted her maybe
[49:28] she could do some some clothes fix some
[49:31] clothes for her so when she came home
[49:34] she said sister Mercy sent you this
[49:37] which was some homemade good Mexican
[49:40] food and um so went to eat it last night
[49:44] and and when we opened it up there was
[49:46] some homemade Mexican food there was
[49:48] some apples in there and there was a box
[49:50] of french
[49:52] fries you know and I thought well
[49:56] I'm going to eat I said no she sent she
[49:58] sent it also for the first time ever
[50:00] I've eaten two um what are they called
[50:04] we call them gorditas it's like a
[50:06] thicken chilada full of chili and all
[50:08] and a box of french fries with
[50:11] it that's what sister Mercy sent and I
[50:15] said she would be happy to hear that I
[50:17] ate it now if I went to the restaurant I
[50:20] probably wouldn't order
[50:21] that but we were kind of laughing about
[50:23] it but you know in her heart she s that
[50:26] and you know what I enjoyed
[50:29] it and brother Jonathan singing in his
[50:32] language and as I was sitting back there
[50:33] and I saying God understands it fully he
[50:36] knows everyone maybe if if brother
[50:39] Jonathan had sung a song that we didn't
[50:41] know didn't know the words too we would
[50:43] be listening to him singing We really
[50:45] wouldn't know but he sang a song we knew
[50:47] we could follow but God knows every
[50:51] language what he's done what he's
[50:53] created then in the message I
[50:57] identification he came as a redeemer and
[51:00] to redeem anything is to bring it back
[51:02] amen bring it back it was God's thought
[51:06] you think little you little me no one in
[51:09] the world could take my place nobody can
[51:12] take yours you being a Christian filled
[51:15] with a spirit God and before the
[51:17] foundation of the world seen you and
[51:19] knowed every feature that you got see
[51:22] and Jesus came come to bring bring you
[51:26] back I'm part of the family the family
[51:29] of God and it's a whole
[51:32] family you know I I've shared this with
[51:35] you when we had
[51:37] the had to have the my toe amputated and
[51:40] and all that we went through and and the
[51:42] doctors and and them helping you out you
[51:44] know change your diet do this do that
[51:46] and they're doing it for for a
[51:49] reason but the the case manager sat down
[51:52] me and my wife and she's explaining
[51:53] thing to us you know and she says there
[51:57] about 6,000 things going on in your body
[52:00] at all
[52:02] times she said that you're not even
[52:05] aware
[52:06] of until one of them doesn't go right
[52:11] and something
[52:13] happens you go to the doctor and the
[52:15] doctor begins to listen to your symptoms
[52:17] they take X-rays or or however they do
[52:20] it now you know and and scan you and all
[52:22] and they say oh they start looking for
[52:24] certain things that are not supposed to
[52:27] be that
[52:28] way you know this this blood count is
[52:31] too high or this blood count is too low
[52:34] this because God made a perfect
[52:38] body but sin got in there and change
[52:41] things but you understand you're part of
[52:45] the body of
[52:47] Christ acknowledge that say I am part of
[52:50] the body of Christ amen and every part
[52:53] is necessary he saw each each one of us
[52:56] not one greater than the
[52:59] other because every part is
[53:02] needed I'm I'm going to read this I
[53:04] didn't give it to the brothers it's just
[53:06] uh from daily strength and I really
[53:08] thought this would go well with tonight
[53:12] and then we're going to get into the
[53:13] book of
[53:15] Ephesians the scripture this is out of
[53:17] Acts 8: 26-31 and the angel of the Lord
[53:20] spake unto Phillip saying arise and go
[53:22] towards the South unto the way that
[53:25] goeth down from Jerusalem un to Gaza
[53:27] which is the desert and he arose and
[53:30] went and behold a man of Ethiopia a unic
[53:32] of great Authority Under Candice Queen
[53:34] of the Ethiopians who had the charge of
[53:37] her treasure and had come to Jerusalem
[53:39] for to worship was returning and sitting
[53:42] in his Chariot read Isaiah the prophet
[53:46] then the spirit said unto Phillip go
[53:48] near and join thyself to this Chariot
[53:52] and Philip ran thither to him and heard
[53:54] him read the prophet Isaiah and said
[53:57] understandeth what thou readest and this
[53:59] was his answer and he said how can I
[54:02] except some man should guide me and he
[54:05] desired Phillip that You' come up and
[54:07] sit with
[54:09] him he says unless there's somebody here
[54:12] to help me how can I understand but God
[54:15] had already sent
[54:16] Phillip said go that way you're going to
[54:20] be needed down that
[54:24] way a normal Ethiopian unic was led to
[54:27] Christ simply because one man followed
[54:30] an abnormal leading from the
[54:33] Lord this is in the the story of book
[54:36] Vex tells us that we must always follow
[54:39] the leading of the Holy Spirit however
[54:42] crazy or contrary it may
[54:44] seem we we can know from experience and
[54:47] the scriptures that the Lord's ways are
[54:49] not our ways regardless of the situation
[54:52] or the circumstances we should always
[54:55] rely on his leading someone's salvation
[54:59] might depend on how much you do respond
[55:02] to the Holy
[55:04] Spirit what if it was that one
[55:06] opportunity that you this person was
[55:08] going to have and you were sent that
[55:12] way and you you said I don't want to do
[55:16] it now we know that God ordains these
[55:19] things but we have to be willing to say
[55:21] yes Lord I
[55:24] will Charles Spurgeon wrote about this
[55:27] particular Ethiopian he said he had
[55:30] followed the light he had and though he
[55:32] had not yet come to the full Glory of
[55:34] Christianity it was more than probable
[55:36] that he would do so because he was
[55:39] evidently prepared to follow truth
[55:41] wherever her flaming torch should lead
[55:44] the way if there's a desire there
[55:47] there's something to respond to
[55:49] it we see the lives working we see the
[55:52] Lord working in the lives of two
[55:54] individuals even though they didn't know
[55:56] what what was going to happen the Holy
[55:58] Spirit was in
[55:59] control that Ethiopian didn't know that
[56:03] what he was reading and the Holy Spirit
[56:05] provided him a teacher he used Phillip
[56:07] to teach him the
[56:11] truth Phillip a man with the Holy
[56:15] Ghost you a child of God with the Holy
[56:19] Ghost are in that same position to be
[56:21] used by
[56:23] God God will will use you if you stay
[56:26] focused on the Holy Spirit God will
[56:27] teach you through someone else if you
[56:30] are the in the right attitude this is
[56:33] how the Holy Spirit Works in his people
[56:35] by placing a thirst in one and placing a
[56:38] burden on another the two come together
[56:41] perfectly led by
[56:43] Christ what would it be if we laid our
[56:46] side aside our differences and simply
[56:48] relied on the leading of the Holy
[56:52] Spirit brother brandom said that's what
[56:54] the the Ian said to Phillip how can I
[56:56] know this lest some man Teach me the
[56:59] Holy Spirit was sent for a teacher let
[57:01] him come into your heart he will teach
[57:04] you that Jesus is the same he said when
[57:07] the Holy Ghost has come he will testify
[57:10] me and we know that's
[57:13] true Philip said the the angel told him
[57:16] go so Philip
[57:19] went he made himself
[57:22] available Hebrews 13:21 make you perfect
[57:26] in every good work to do his will
[57:28] working in you that which is pleasing in
[57:32] his sight through Jesus Christ to whom
[57:34] be glory forever and ever amen many of
[57:38] us Wonder so often what is it exactly
[57:41] that the Lord wants me to
[57:43] do some might think on a daily basis and
[57:46] what must I do for the Lord and how do I
[57:49] do
[57:49] it it is right to think that way when we
[57:53] G gave our hearts to the Lord we
[57:55] submitted ourselves to a life of service
[57:57] to the king going about regular business
[58:00] then might seem like nothing is being
[58:02] accomplished toward the towards a king's
[58:04] business even Jesus as a young boy was
[58:08] about his father's
[58:10] business and and sometimes we compare
[58:13] ourselves to others compare ourselves to
[58:15] this and it looks greater it looks
[58:16] better it looks more
[58:20] effective but if you could see the whole
[58:22] structure you would realize that every
[58:24] every part is
[58:26] needed you must realize one thing that
[58:29] God will use however much of yourself
[58:31] you give him in whatever capacity he
[58:35] created you for to some he gave the
[58:37] ability to sing others to preach others
[58:41] to organize and manage and some to
[58:44] encourage God had God has made you
[58:47] perfect for the work he needs you to do
[58:51] and it is he who will develop that skill
[58:54] and and gift in his own time frame it is
[58:57] up to you simply to surrender your gift
[59:00] back to his service for him to use what
[59:04] whenever and however he
[59:06] chooses and that's the hard part I have
[59:09] a gift I know I have this Lord and this
[59:11] is how I think you should use it this is
[59:13] how I think it should be applied I'm
[59:15] ready now I'm ready
[59:17] today and God says no it's not time just
[59:21] wait the Lord could prepare you 50 years
[59:24] for 5 minutes of service for him someone
[59:27] else he might just prepare for 5 minutes
[59:31] for 50 years of
[59:33] service and you say that's not fair but
[59:36] God knows what he's doing your job is to
[59:39] just be usable living live pleasing to
[59:43] him wait on the Lord and He will use you
[59:46] you are precious to the kingdom of God
[59:49] because you were fearfully and
[59:50] wonderfully made just let him use you in
[59:54] his way in his
[59:56] time and the message what went ye out to
[59:59] see brother bam says when I think of
[1:00:01] that it it wakes me to something what
[1:00:04] must we do I said to the wife the other
[1:00:07] day honey I'm 50 years old and I can't
[1:00:09] be here much
[1:00:11] longer then I walked out I stood there
[1:00:13] in the woods I went out hunting I stood
[1:00:17] there in the woods a little bit I
[1:00:18] thought of that 50 years old what's the
[1:00:21] matter then something said and and said
[1:00:24] to me God could train you for 50 years
[1:00:26] to do 50 minutes of work whatever the
[1:00:29] training's been God knows what he's
[1:00:31] doing he's TR he trained Moses 80 years
[1:00:34] to get 40 years of service from him
[1:00:37] God's training his people God's training
[1:00:39] his church if we only if we're only
[1:00:43] willing to let God have his way to do
[1:00:46] that thing which is right if we're only
[1:00:49] willing to submit ourselves unto him
[1:00:52] that's a thing to do God takes the
[1:00:54] simple
[1:01:01] things you know this water has been
[1:01:04] sitting every service there's a bottle
[1:01:06] of water up here or a cup of
[1:01:09] water and I never drink it and then
[1:01:12] after I said why didn't I drink any
[1:01:14] water it's the problem with the water
[1:01:17] isn't
[1:01:18] it no it's just me not taking a drink of
[1:01:23] water sometimes when we look at things
[1:01:26] we look at them under our own
[1:01:28] perspective and it's not always
[1:01:30] right so we're going to get into some
[1:01:32] scriptures here in
[1:01:34] Ephesians and Paul when he's speaking we
[1:01:37] know to Ephesians he's speaking to a
[1:01:39] mature Church a group you know when he
[1:01:42] talks to the Corinthians with it's
[1:01:44] always been about a church that was
[1:01:45] still going through a lot of growing up
[1:01:47] and but to the Ephesian but he writes
[1:01:50] the same thing to
[1:01:51] both he doesn't change the scripture for
[1:01:54] the Ephesian for the Ephesians or or the
[1:01:57] Corinthians he just ministered to them
[1:01:59] in the level where they need it so we're
[1:02:02] going to go through the first four
[1:02:03] chapters of Ephesians just picking out
[1:02:06] some scriptures here where you'll
[1:02:08] realize it's God who's plac the gift in
[1:02:12] you it's not you choosing the gift you
[1:02:16] want because most of us would choose
[1:02:19] this over here and very little of this
[1:02:21] is needed would be getting
[1:02:22] done but every part is
[1:02:27] needed so Ephesians chap 1 verse one
[1:02:30] we'll start with
[1:02:32] that Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[1:02:36] the will of
[1:02:38] God to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[1:02:42] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus he
[1:02:46] addresses you as a saint and as a
[1:02:50] faithful one that's how God looks at you
[1:02:53] one of his one of his his
[1:02:56] own and and I like this Paul an apostle
[1:02:59] of Christ Jesus by the purpose of God or
[1:03:02] for the purpose of God now we're we're
[1:03:05] reading where Paul is saying this but
[1:03:08] it's your name in there you've got to
[1:03:10] apply yourself in the
[1:03:12] scripture and sisters this means you too
[1:03:15] sometimes well that's for that position
[1:03:17] for a brother and that no there's a
[1:03:19] place for every one of
[1:03:20] us by the will of God not by any Merit
[1:03:24] of my own if anything if you look at the
[1:03:27] first portion of Paul's life if anything
[1:03:30] he was contrary to everything what God
[1:03:32] was
[1:03:32] doing and he was self-righteous in what
[1:03:36] he was
[1:03:37] doing these people are going against the
[1:03:40] law that it was established by Moses and
[1:03:42] we we've just had all this teaching
[1:03:45] through the through the book of Acts and
[1:03:47] now getting into the old how the law and
[1:03:49] the law and the
[1:03:51] law in one sense it's easier to live by
[1:03:54] the
[1:03:55] law I can do this and I can't do this I
[1:03:58] can go this fast and I can't go this
[1:04:03] fast but when God gives you
[1:04:06] Grace and says I will lead you I will
[1:04:09] guide you sometimes it's just be it's
[1:04:11] easier just to be told what to
[1:04:14] do in the in working in in in the uh
[1:04:17] countertop shop I'd have some guys that
[1:04:20] just tell me what to do and I'll do it
[1:04:23] and others would say teach me how to do
[1:04:25] it and then I can do it
[1:04:28] myself and God wants folks that would
[1:04:31] say Lord I want to be led directed get
[1:04:33] Guided by you you teach me what my place
[1:04:36] and part
[1:04:38] is and then in verse four of chapter 1
[1:04:41] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:04:45] before the foundation of the world that
[1:04:47] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:04:50] before him in love that's how he chose
[1:04:53] us
[1:04:55] he
[1:04:57] says he choses chap verse 5 having
[1:05:01] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:05:04] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:05:07] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:05:12] will we were designed before by him for
[1:05:16] the positions of sons to
[1:05:20] himself Sons and Daughters part of his
[1:05:22] thing it was his children in his
[1:05:28] doing verse six to to the praise of the
[1:05:32] glory of his grace wherein he hath made
[1:05:36] us accepted in the Beloved so Paul
[1:05:39] establishes it right in the beginning
[1:05:41] it's God's choosing it's God's desire
[1:05:44] it's what he wanted to
[1:05:45] do and you were included in what he
[1:05:48] desired to
[1:05:50] do and then if we go over to verse n
[1:05:55] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:05:57] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:06:01] which he has purposed in
[1:06:03] himself you know and if it was that if
[1:06:06] it was me telling you that hey this is
[1:06:09] what I want for you and this because you
[1:06:11] know I would say um maybe you should go
[1:06:14] find somebody a little better somebody
[1:06:16] can better keep their word but we're
[1:06:17] talking about the Eternal Creator we're
[1:06:19] talking the one that understands it all
[1:06:21] and knows it all and he chose to do it
[1:06:23] this way because he's able to do
[1:06:25] so and I like it this way having made
[1:06:28] clear to us the secret of his purpose in
[1:06:32] agreement with the design which he had
[1:06:34] in mind to put into his
[1:06:37] hands now I I uh was having a
[1:06:40] conversation with with brother Lyall
[1:06:42] when we first got to to meet him and get
[1:06:44] to
[1:06:45] know some of the things that he's done
[1:06:47] same thing with brother Mike yarro and
[1:06:49] and um and their work and
[1:06:52] all but God gave them that
[1:06:55] ability put those things in their mind
[1:06:57] that to me it's just a whole another
[1:07:00] language it's foreign is Chinese would
[1:07:03] be to me what they were talking and one
[1:07:06] day they were both standing outside here
[1:07:08] talking and I got up close and listened
[1:07:10] to their
[1:07:12] conversation
[1:07:13] and might as well have been another
[1:07:15] language I didn't understand half of
[1:07:17] what they were
[1:07:18] saying so I stopped them and I said
[1:07:22] Brothers I could not re recommend your
[1:07:24] brain to
[1:07:26] anybody I said but mine would be worth a
[1:07:29] lot of
[1:07:30] money well that caught their attention
[1:07:33] they both look I brother Lyle didn't
[1:07:34] know me very well then he was relatively
[1:07:37] new and had he hadn't been here for a
[1:07:39] while and brother Mike yes so they gave
[1:07:43] me a strange look I said look at you
[1:07:45] your
[1:07:47] brains millions and millions and
[1:07:49] millions of miles of usage in those
[1:07:51] brains they've been put to work work
[1:07:54] they've been they they've extracted
[1:07:56] everything you could mine is brand new
[1:07:58] hardly even touched yet probably still
[1:08:00] in the original
[1:08:02] package I said that's why it would be
[1:08:04] worth so much a 1959 brain that hasn't
[1:08:07] even been hardly used brother Mike just
[1:08:10] looked at me says get out of
[1:08:12] here but to listen to them talk and see
[1:08:15] some of the things that brother L the
[1:08:17] Lord has allowed him to design to
[1:08:19] develop that and go it's amazing but
[1:08:22] that's what God chose to do with
[1:08:24] life brother Mike Aro was listed in the
[1:08:27] top 10 uh doctors or or um scientist I
[1:08:31] guess at the University of Arizona
[1:08:35] hospital I was talking to his boys after
[1:08:37] after to John and them after the the
[1:08:39] memorial service they didn't even know
[1:08:43] that about their dad because he said
[1:08:45] nothing about it he just went and did
[1:08:47] it it's the one that stands on the
[1:08:50] Mountaintop and says hear me hear me
[1:08:51] hear me that you got to be a little more
[1:08:53] leery about sometimes but God has done
[1:08:59] this and when you realize it's God has
[1:09:01] done it for you then give him the glory
[1:09:03] and let him use you the way he wants to
[1:09:06] be
[1:09:11] doing in verse 11 in whom also we have
[1:09:16] OB obtained an inheritance being
[1:09:19] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:09:21] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:09:25] counsel of his own
[1:09:28] will and his will is
[1:09:31] perfect then we'll jump to verse
[1:09:35] 22 through and 23 and has put all things
[1:09:39] under his feet and gave him to be the
[1:09:42] head over all the things of the
[1:09:45] church and if you ever wanted a headship
[1:09:48] that's the perfect
[1:09:50] headship because he knows all things he
[1:09:52] has control of it all and he has the
[1:09:54] best intention for
[1:09:57] you and he has given him to be the head
[1:09:59] over all things to the church a head
[1:10:02] both of guidance and government and
[1:10:04] likewise of life and influence to the
[1:10:07] whole and every member of it she said
[1:10:11] I'm just a little part yet he's still
[1:10:14] concerned which is his body the fullness
[1:10:18] of him that filth all and all I'm so
[1:10:22] glad I'm a part part of the family of
[1:10:25] God join HS part of it every part of it
[1:10:29] will be
[1:10:30] there go to Ephesians chapter 2 veres
[1:10:37] 8-10 for by Grace ye are saved through
[1:10:41] faith and that not of yourself it is a
[1:10:44] gift of
[1:10:46] God by Grace God's choosing he chose to
[1:10:49] have mercy on you he desired it you know
[1:10:52] why because there is Mercy mer in him
[1:10:54] there is Grace in him he is giving out
[1:10:56] what he
[1:10:58] is you know uh uh that stream that that
[1:11:02] little U fountain that brother brand
[1:11:04] said he he used to go drink out of he
[1:11:05] said if I if I could talk to it if it
[1:11:07] could talk back to me and I would ask it
[1:11:10] he said what makes you so happy why are
[1:11:12] you bubbling all the
[1:11:14] time is it because the animals come and
[1:11:17] drink it would say no is it because the
[1:11:20] birds come by is it because I say no
[1:11:22] what is it's just something in inside me
[1:11:24] that's bubbling and I can't help it it's
[1:11:27] Christ in me the hope of
[1:11:29] glory he says it is a gift of God not of
[1:11:34] Works lest any man should
[1:11:37] boast and this is where it gets a little
[1:11:39] bit hard for us because we want to do
[1:11:44] works because we feel and honestly
[1:11:47] believe that's what pleases God that's
[1:11:49] what's evident for us when you see
[1:11:51] somebody doing something somebody
[1:11:52] cleaning uh brother Ben comes here opens
[1:11:55] up the door turns the air conditioner on
[1:11:58] cleans out the front and all and
[1:12:01] sometimes brother Ben's not here and we
[1:12:04] get here and everything's still off and
[1:12:07] our first question is where's brother
[1:12:09] Ben because you're used to it taking
[1:12:12] care of it you
[1:12:15] know but it's it's it's he
[1:12:19] says not of Works lest any man should
[1:12:22] boast brother Ben has never said haha
[1:12:25] you can't do this without me in fact
[1:12:27] he'll call and say I can't be here
[1:12:28] tonight he's one of the kindest men I've
[1:12:31] met and and most people and and I'll
[1:12:34] just be honest with it look at that as a
[1:12:36] starting job but it's his desire to do
[1:12:39] it I want to be a doctor I want to be
[1:12:42] the head of this I want to be this
[1:12:44] because everybody's going to notice
[1:12:46] me but somebody has to do the other part
[1:12:50] and if if that's what he wants me to do
[1:12:52] Lord help me to have the attitud to do
[1:12:56] that not of Works lest any man should
[1:12:59] boast and then verse 10 for we are his
[1:13:04] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:13:07] good works which God hath before
[1:13:10] ordained that we should walk in them so
[1:13:13] there is no fear in them because God has
[1:13:15] already ordained
[1:13:17] it Lord you know what you want me to do
[1:13:19] you know what it is help me just to
[1:13:21] trust in you and do what you want
[1:13:24] workmanship workmanship refers to more
[1:13:27] than the product of creation it also
[1:13:31] refers to the degree of skill which with
[1:13:35] which a product is made that degree of
[1:13:38] skill imparts value to the thing made
[1:13:41] for
[1:13:42] example we could say that vase is of
[1:13:45] excellent
[1:13:48] workmanship the vase itself is lovely
[1:13:51] but its value is derived from the
[1:13:53] talents of the one who designed and
[1:13:56] produced it with that definition in mind
[1:13:59] workmanship may be a more fitting term
[1:14:03] than either Masterpiece or handiwork
[1:14:06] because of the emphasis it places on the
[1:14:09] Creator rather than the
[1:14:13] creation it's his workmanship and he
[1:14:16] doesn't do anything wrong or failure he
[1:14:19] doesn't have to go back and try it again
[1:14:21] he doesn't have to go back and read the
[1:14:22] book and see where did I miss it where
[1:14:24] did I get
[1:14:26] it when when I would lay out the
[1:14:28] countertops and and we would draw them
[1:14:30] out we were working with acrylics and
[1:14:32] and you would lay it all out template
[1:14:34] before it cut I used to tell the the
[1:14:36] guys as I was training them and I was
[1:14:38] doing a lot of training then and I would
[1:14:40] say take the templates take the
[1:14:42] measurement double check everything I
[1:14:44] laid
[1:14:45] out I may have read 89 but I went
[1:14:50] 98 or I may have taken the the measure
[1:14:53] measuring tape and burned an inch hold
[1:14:54] it at the one inch Mark go out to that
[1:14:56] but forget to add the other inch on the
[1:14:58] end so now you're an inch
[1:15:00] short and if they took 10 or 15 minutes
[1:15:03] before we actually took a blade and
[1:15:04] started cutting they could catch those
[1:15:07] airs and it was a whole lot easier to
[1:15:10] erase that Mark and do another Mark than
[1:15:13] it was to have to rebuild it after it
[1:15:14] been cut too
[1:15:16] short and God's workmanship is
[1:15:19] perfect it's without flaw is without
[1:15:22] failure
[1:15:24] he said so we are his
[1:15:26] workmanship you but it gives emphasis to
[1:15:31] the Creator rather than the
[1:15:33] creation because you are doing your part
[1:15:36] because you are letting God work through
[1:15:38] you you know who's getting glory god is
[1:15:40] getting glory and he deserves it
[1:15:42] all it's when we try to get the glory
[1:15:45] and we try then that we begin to to
[1:15:47] cause
[1:15:51] trouble verse 20
[1:15:54] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:15:56] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[1:15:58] himself being the Chief
[1:16:01] Cornerstone it starts from him and it
[1:16:04] ends with
[1:16:06] him in whom all the building fitly
[1:16:09] framed together groweth unto an Holy
[1:16:13] Temple of the lord it's not this
[1:16:17] building I appreciate everything we have
[1:16:20] in this building how many folks come and
[1:16:22] they say oh that we could have this oh
[1:16:24] that we could have it like you oh that
[1:16:26] we you know I I know Sister L and sister
[1:16:29] Grace enough if they could have somebody
[1:16:31] else play they would have somebody else
[1:16:33] play am I right you've said it enough
[1:16:36] times because they're not here to say
[1:16:39] hey you got to listen to me they're
[1:16:41] doing and others would say you guys are
[1:16:44] so privileged to have them
[1:16:46] mo sometimes it gets uh what's the word
[1:16:50] we just get used to it and we forget to
[1:16:52] appre appreciate what we got we got
[1:16:55] brother Daniel now in the guitar up
[1:16:57] there and it does make a
[1:17:01] difference sometimes brother Daniel may
[1:17:03] not feel that way but sometimes just
[1:17:05] listening to that strumming that beat
[1:17:07] and it's a
[1:17:09] blessing every part whatever it
[1:17:14] is of whom all the building fitly framed
[1:17:17] the whole fabric of The Universal Church
[1:17:20] Rises up like a great p of living
[1:17:24] materials unto an Holy Temple in the
[1:17:27] Lord living
[1:17:30] materials you and
[1:17:33] me in whom ye also are building together
[1:17:36] for an habitation of God through the
[1:17:39] spirit why because we're God is wanting
[1:17:42] someone some place to dwell and to walk
[1:17:45] on this Earth again to manifest himself
[1:17:48] and he's chosen me and you and every one
[1:17:51] of his
[1:17:55] Ephesians chapter 3 and we're just going
[1:17:58] to take verse
[1:18:01] 6 that the Gentiles should be fellow
[1:18:04] Heirs of the same body and partakers of
[1:18:09] the promise in Christ by the gospel and
[1:18:13] I find myself included right there the
[1:18:15] Gentiles a lot of this the first part of
[1:18:19] the Old Testament was speaking of the to
[1:18:21] Israel to Abraham and all
[1:18:24] his but if you saw brother bam said
[1:18:28] you've got to see Jesus Christ in every
[1:18:30] scripture if you didn't you go back and
[1:18:32] read it again and there in Hosea as our
[1:18:35] brother spoke today of that perfect type
[1:18:39] of Christ marrying a bride having a
[1:18:42] bride and she goes away yet he goes back
[1:18:45] to redeem her and pays the price for her
[1:18:48] full
[1:18:50] Redemption I was included in that that
[1:18:53] my name was there I've gone wrong off
[1:18:57] him I failed him I've turned my back on
[1:18:59] him I've done what I should but he went
[1:19:02] back to bring me back to
[1:19:04] him that's what Paul says
[1:19:07] here he
[1:19:12] says through though that the Gentiles
[1:19:14] should be fellow Heirs of all the
[1:19:17] promises of all the things receiving the
[1:19:21] same and of the same body and partakers
[1:19:24] of his promise in Christ by the
[1:19:26] gospel now we'll get into Ephesians
[1:19:29] chapter 4 and this is more where Paul
[1:19:32] really begins to speak
[1:19:35] here breaking if you could say starting
[1:19:39] to show how this body is begin to be
[1:19:42] formed Ephesians
[1:19:45] 41 and Paul says I therefore the
[1:19:47] prisoner of the Lord beseech beg implore
[1:19:52] recommend and just just desire that ye
[1:19:55] walk worthy of the
[1:19:57] vocation wherewith ye are called what
[1:20:01] God has called you to do walk worthy of
[1:20:04] it you do not make yourself
[1:20:08] worthy he makes you worthy he saw you
[1:20:11] already doing it he puts a nature in you
[1:20:15] to do it he gives you the desire to do
[1:20:19] it and and I could call some of you by
[1:20:22] name here and see what you all do I I've
[1:20:25] been in here with and I'm not going to
[1:20:26] call them by name but I've seen some of
[1:20:27] the sisters just walking up and down the
[1:20:29] benches and straightening all the books
[1:20:31] and making everything look nice and
[1:20:33] neat because the books don't do it by
[1:20:38] themselves at least I've never seen it
[1:20:40] happen that way I've seen the sisters
[1:20:42] doing it and I've done it myself
[1:20:44] sometimes walking through and picking up
[1:20:46] you know after the kids of somebody
[1:20:48] didn't clean up after the kids were
[1:20:50] eating cookies in the back rows or
[1:20:51] something like that and cleaned it
[1:20:54] up it's part of the nature of doing
[1:20:58] those
[1:21:00] things nobody nobody tells me nobody has
[1:21:05] told me so I'll just ask don't start
[1:21:08] doing it
[1:21:08] please do this go pick up that go after
[1:21:11] that you got to you no no I I when he
[1:21:15] used to sit there in the back where
[1:21:16] brother Lyle is now I did for many years
[1:21:19] kind of you know watching that door and
[1:21:21] all brother green stood there one day
[1:21:24] and he's just looking at
[1:21:26] me and sometimes you're not too sure
[1:21:29] what he's thinking but you're you kind
[1:21:31] of feel like you were about to hear
[1:21:32] something from
[1:21:33] him so I said brother green I never put
[1:21:37] myself in this position because I wanted
[1:21:40] to be
[1:21:41] here just it needed to be done so I came
[1:21:45] and started doing it and he looks at me
[1:21:48] he says brother Aaron God put that in
[1:21:50] you so that's why you're doing it
[1:21:53] he said and he just walked
[1:21:56] away and that's how God
[1:22:00] works uh he doesn't call you know one of
[1:22:04] you or or brother Merl over and say
[1:22:06] brother Merl do I have your permission
[1:22:08] to let brother son he puts it in that
[1:22:11] brother's heart and in brother Merl's
[1:22:12] heart he put brother Mer's heart to pray
[1:22:14] for the brother that's doing it that's
[1:22:16] how God
[1:22:19] works
[1:22:21] so
[1:22:23] Paul maybe in another way I then the
[1:22:26] prisoner in the Lord make this request
[1:22:28] from my heart that you will see that
[1:22:31] your behavior is a credit to the
[1:22:34] position which God purpose God's purpose
[1:22:37] has given
[1:22:40] you sometimes reading it in another
[1:22:43] translation just opens it up a little
[1:22:44] bit the purpose that God placed you
[1:22:49] therefore with all loneliness and
[1:22:52] weekness and
[1:22:54] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[1:22:58] love
[1:23:00] loneliness not you trying to exalt
[1:23:03] yourself meekness keeping a sweet humble
[1:23:05] spirit and with longsuffering because
[1:23:08] sometimes people judge you wrong they
[1:23:12] miss you know your intention your heart
[1:23:15] but somebody didn't see that that
[1:23:17] way forbearing one another in love love
[1:23:21] covers them multitude of sins the
[1:23:24] scripture says and I'm glad because I
[1:23:26] need his love to cover me through his
[1:23:30] blood with all gentle and quiet behavior
[1:23:35] taking whatever
[1:23:36] comes uh putting up with one another in
[1:23:41] love and uh you know I I
[1:23:45] shared this morning what we both looked
[1:23:48] at and Sh said I'm sorry you had to put
[1:23:49] up with this and she turned around
[1:23:51] looked at no you had to put up with me
[1:23:53] and we just smile to each other there's
[1:23:55] a you get to know each other and we knew
[1:23:57] we both meant hey it's okay it's all
[1:24:03] right endeavoring making an effort to
[1:24:07] keep the unity of the spirit in the bond
[1:24:10] of peace there's only one spirit of God
[1:24:14] and that's his
[1:24:16] Spirit to keeping and and his Spirit has
[1:24:20] a peace that comes with it us an
[1:24:22] assurance that comes with it a blessing
[1:24:24] that comes with it he
[1:24:27] says endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:24:30] the spirit that Mutual Union and Harmony
[1:24:33] which is a fruit of the spirit the bond
[1:24:35] of peace is
[1:24:38] love when you love someone you honestly
[1:24:41] love
[1:24:42] someone you can accept their
[1:24:45] failures you can accept their
[1:24:48] wrongdoings because the greatest one
[1:24:50] that loved you accepted yours and took
[1:24:52] it upon
[1:24:54] himself when I wasn't worthy when I
[1:24:57] couldn't save myself he said I'll go
[1:24:59] take your place and do it for
[1:25:01] you he said I'll put my shoulder and
[1:25:04] help bury the care of the
[1:25:10] burden verse 7 but unto every one of us
[1:25:13] is given Grace according to the measure
[1:25:17] of the gift of Christ to every one of
[1:25:21] us now now sometimes it takes some
[1:25:23] growing into that gift understanding
[1:25:26] that what it is
[1:25:28] that you don't you just don't lay and
[1:25:31] sit there I'm going to wait till the
[1:25:32] gift comes upon me and then I'll begin
[1:25:35] to manifest the gift no there's a
[1:25:36] working of the gift there's a learning
[1:25:38] how to surrender to yield and being a
[1:25:40] part
[1:25:41] of growing up as a young child and
[1:25:44] growing up to being a little bit bit
[1:25:46] older I remember Asher about 3 years old
[1:25:49] and he got this tool belt with with
[1:25:52] plastic tools in it and he was he was
[1:25:55] getting to talking quite a bit make
[1:25:56] himself understood and we were putting
[1:25:59] up a a a uh ceiling fan and it had one
[1:26:03] of those sensors in it and I wired It
[1:26:06] reversed the wiring and it didn't want
[1:26:08] to work and he's looking at it and he
[1:26:10] goes Papa if I had my tools I could fix
[1:26:13] that for
[1:26:14] you and my thought is when you're 16
[1:26:17] years old I'm going to ask you and see
[1:26:18] if you'll come over and still want to do
[1:26:20] that no papa I'm with my friends no papa
[1:26:22] I'm with my girlfriend you know
[1:26:25] something else going but he said and
[1:26:27] then Abby told me yeah we were over she
[1:26:29] was over at the in-laws and he's walking
[1:26:31] around looking at his grandpa's house
[1:26:34] over there and he said Mom if I had my
[1:26:36] tools I could fix right there where it's
[1:26:37] not fixing Grandpa's
[1:26:39] rough and if they gave him a lad and
[1:26:41] Tool he probably would have went up
[1:26:42] there you
[1:26:43] know but he's not at that place where he
[1:26:46] can do it that comes with time and
[1:26:49] learning and
[1:26:51] experience God places you in a position
[1:26:54] for you to learn what God wants you to
[1:26:56] do by
[1:26:58] experience to comfort someone because
[1:27:00] you've been through that
[1:27:02] already to help someone because you've
[1:27:05] Beed that burden
[1:27:13] before according to Christ as Christ is
[1:27:16] pleased to give to each the measure of
[1:27:18] the gift of Christ wherein he saith when
[1:27:21] he ascended on high he led captivity
[1:27:24] captive and gave gifts unto men and then
[1:27:29] probably one of the most used scriptures
[1:27:31] and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:27:34] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:27:37] pastors and some
[1:27:40] teachers five we call it the five full
[1:27:44] ministry and I guess nobody else has
[1:27:47] anything but
[1:27:49] them that's how some of the five full
[1:27:51] min Ministry acts at times you got to
[1:27:54] listen to me you got to do it my way I'm
[1:27:57] no because he
[1:28:00] says for the perfecting of the
[1:28:05] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:28:08] the edifying of the body of Christ that
[1:28:12] is their
[1:28:14] work because that portion of the body
[1:28:17] needs to help the rest of the
[1:28:20] body you know when when you feed
[1:28:23] yourself and you especially eat the
[1:28:25] things you should be
[1:28:27] eating doing the healthy type
[1:28:30] eating
[1:28:32] um whether it's good for you or bad for
[1:28:35] you most of it goes through the mouth
[1:28:37] first right because that's how most of
[1:28:39] us eat I
[1:28:41] think now I know if you're there's some
[1:28:44] conditions where they have to feed you
[1:28:45] through IVM but I'm talking the natural
[1:28:48] you know it it is in other words for the
[1:28:50] edifying of the body of Christ God chose
[1:28:53] to use men to
[1:28:56] speak to minister it's how God chose to
[1:28:59] do
[1:29:00] that but that man that God has chosen to
[1:29:04] do has to understand like Phillip God
[1:29:06] sends me to do this God tells me to do
[1:29:09] this God is working through me it's God
[1:29:11] in
[1:29:12] Me Not me telling God how to handle
[1:29:17] this and some of the one of the things
[1:29:19] that you you know the the thing that's
[1:29:22] going on in today's message that we
[1:29:24] don't need the fful ministry anymore we
[1:29:26] need this God took it in the scripture
[1:29:29] he'll take it out when he's
[1:29:30] done every part of the body is needed
[1:29:35] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:29:38] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:29:40] the body of Christ that's me and you the
[1:29:43] body of Christ for the equipping of the
[1:29:46] Saints for the work of service to the
[1:29:49] building up of the body of Christ
[1:29:53] and I appreciate brother Lyall and
[1:29:55] brother Dan what they just did here
[1:29:58] going through the book of Acts and
[1:29:59] neither one of them ever stood up and
[1:30:01] said you got to listen to me it's got to
[1:30:04] be this way they stayed with the
[1:30:07] scripture and they encourage each one of
[1:30:09] us to receive what God has for
[1:30:14] us till we all come into the unity of
[1:30:17] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:30:20] Son of God unto a perfect man a whole
[1:30:24] man a complete man a builtup adult yes
[1:30:29] that's what he's talking about there
[1:30:32] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:30:34] fullness of Christ the same way he
[1:30:37] learned and the same way he
[1:30:39] grew till he heard his father say this
[1:30:43] is my beloved Son hear ye
[1:30:46] him he was tested he was tried he was
[1:30:50] proved he can be touched by The Filling
[1:30:52] of their in of our infirmities he can
[1:30:55] understand where we say I I don't
[1:30:56] understand this I can't he went through
[1:31:00] that he even cried out father if it be
[1:31:02] thy will let's do this
[1:31:05] differently but he said I yield to your
[1:31:07] will Lord I'm so glad he
[1:31:12] did till we all come in the unity of the
[1:31:16] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:31:18] God unto a perfect a whole complete unto
[1:31:22] the measure of the stature of the
[1:31:24] fullness of Christ and as Paul said
[1:31:26] Christ in you the hope of glory so if
[1:31:29] it's Christ in you the hope of glory you
[1:31:31] know what you share Christ to
[1:31:34] others and you know what he becomes
[1:31:37] their hope of glory
[1:31:39] also as we saw that the two young lady
[1:31:41] and the two young men getting bapt today
[1:31:44] baptized today and they have that same
[1:31:46] opportunity and and ability to receive
[1:31:49] the Holy Spirit the hope of glory in
[1:31:51] them
[1:31:53] oh but brother they didn't come to our
[1:31:55] church they didn't come our way they
[1:31:57] didn't do this leave that to God you
[1:32:00] pray for them you be a Christian before
[1:32:03] them you be an example to them you be a
[1:32:05] help to them to get to that same place
[1:32:08] where by the grace of God you've been
[1:32:10] able to get
[1:32:13] to and then Paul says in 14 that we
[1:32:16] henceforth be no more
[1:32:19] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:32:22] about with every wind of doctrine that
[1:32:24] we henceforth be no more
[1:32:27] children now all of us to the best of my
[1:32:31] knowledge looking at all of you we all
[1:32:33] started the same as a newborn to
[1:32:37] whatever age we are and we all had to
[1:32:40] grow and
[1:32:42] learn is there anybody that just came
[1:32:44] out
[1:32:46] perfect you're willing to raise your
[1:32:48] hand no probably not no we all went
[1:32:51] through a process say that children
[1:32:52] growing so Paul says this he says that
[1:32:55] we be no more children tossed to and fro
[1:32:57] but we've grown up beyond that point to
[1:33:00] understand those things to have
[1:33:01] experienced them not just by head
[1:33:03] knowledge and hearing but by application
[1:33:06] by learning and put into
[1:33:08] use brother Daniel you're you're going
[1:33:11] through some medical training and stuff
[1:33:12] like that are
[1:33:13] you anybody need surgery brother
[1:33:16] Daniel's
[1:33:18] a I noticed nobody
[1:33:20] volunteered
[1:33:22] not quite ready there yet are you but
[1:33:24] you're willing to go to whatever you're
[1:33:26] going to right that's that training that
[1:33:28] learning and having a right attitude a
[1:33:30] right motive a right and you can be be
[1:33:33] taught you can be
[1:33:36] trained and maybe one of these days
[1:33:38] brother Daniel is going to be able to
[1:33:39] help one of us we had a brother in the
[1:33:42] Spanish Church who was a
[1:33:44] doctor and and he had actually got his
[1:33:47] his Doctrine in
[1:33:48] Mexico but it didn't cross over so he
[1:33:52] just became a a physician's assistant
[1:33:54] here but he he because they really
[1:33:57] appreciate him where he worked at SEL
[1:33:59] mind they would let him bring some of
[1:34:01] the stuff home and he did some minor
[1:34:04] surgery on me at my house at no
[1:34:07] cost but we knew about it and I had full
[1:34:10] confidence in him because he knew what
[1:34:11] he was doing but had it been brother
[1:34:14] Daniel H he might said let's not this
[1:34:18] time you
[1:34:19] know but Lord will over time it would be
[1:34:23] the same with you because you've learned
[1:34:25] you've
[1:34:26] grown the same thing with handling this
[1:34:30] word you give it to a novice they have a
[1:34:33] lot of desire and want to but who knows
[1:34:36] what could
[1:34:37] happen but when you give it to someone
[1:34:39] who has met Christ and has experienced
[1:34:41] Christ and has walk with Christ and
[1:34:43] knows him he can take this word and said
[1:34:45] look what it's done to
[1:34:48] me let my life be an Evidence of what
[1:34:51] this word of God
[1:34:56] does it says henceforth we be no more
[1:34:59] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:35:01] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:35:04] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[1:35:07] whereby they lie in wait to
[1:35:11] deceive and I I I pray that that
[1:35:13] wouldn't be true but it does happen
[1:35:16] because it's happened to me where
[1:35:17] they've come to me there was a I didn't
[1:35:19] know them we went to to visit at a
[1:35:23] uh a family was coming to church they
[1:35:25] had their their um daughter son had a
[1:35:28] birthday and our our children about the
[1:35:29] same size they invited us all and we
[1:35:31] come walking into the house and there's
[1:35:33] a couple of Brothers there that I didn't
[1:35:35] know but they were brothers they were
[1:35:37] there so greeted them all and one of the
[1:35:39] brothers says where do you go to church
[1:35:41] oh we're at susson
[1:35:43] Tabernacle I might as well have said I
[1:35:45] go to a Catholic church because you
[1:35:47] could see it in his face like oh my have
[1:35:49] all the places to go why there so they
[1:35:52] sat down and we we and he began to
[1:35:54] preach to me and preach to me and tell
[1:35:56] me and tell me this that and the other
[1:35:58] the other two brothers knew it so they
[1:36:00] just walked around they never stopped
[1:36:02] that I walked in with because they
[1:36:03] already knew well after a while I I'd
[1:36:06] heard enough he was he had his eyes
[1:36:08] closed and just preaching I got up and
[1:36:09] walked away he kept preaching to the
[1:36:11] wall he didn't even know I had left the
[1:36:14] other brother tapped him on the shoulder
[1:36:16] and said brother the brother has left
[1:36:17] already and he looked up and I wasn't
[1:36:19] there anymore I was watching from over
[1:36:21] there
[1:36:22] you know what I've run into him before
[1:36:23] still my
[1:36:25] brother I have no reason to look down on
[1:36:27] him and hate him and still my brother
[1:36:30] because that was me at one time but God
[1:36:33] rich in Mercy reached down and got a
[1:36:36] hold of my
[1:36:38] life and now by the grace of God maybe
[1:36:41] we can be a help to someone
[1:36:43] else but speaking the truth in
[1:36:48] love what did we hear this morning
[1:36:52] love is God's motive love is what God is
[1:36:55] who he
[1:36:57] is and sometimes when he is correcting
[1:37:00] he's correcting because he loves
[1:37:03] you because if he didn't care he would
[1:37:06] say whatever go do what you ever want
[1:37:08] whatever makes you
[1:37:10] happy but he knows the end result on
[1:37:14] that speaking the truth and love may
[1:37:16] grow up into him in all things which is
[1:37:20] the head even Christ speaking the truth
[1:37:24] in love truth is never to give way to
[1:37:27] false Doctrine but it must be spoken in
[1:37:31] love some cling to the truth tenaciously
[1:37:34] but forget to speak it in
[1:37:38] love and as a dad and his mom especially
[1:37:41] when the young ones are first growing up
[1:37:44] and you get impatient you get tired I
[1:37:47] don't know how much love is being
[1:37:48] expressed around that time
[1:37:52] you know I I I some of my girls and said
[1:37:55] how come she got away with it and I
[1:37:58] didn't because you happen to be the last
[1:38:01] one born in the family and you got away
[1:38:03] a whole lot more ask your older sister
[1:38:06] she'll tell you I couldn't do that I got
[1:38:08] in trouble for that they they they
[1:38:10] learned how to work that uh Abby Rachel
[1:38:13] and nah were in the same bedroom before
[1:38:16] we got the the extra bedroom and they
[1:38:18] would get quite loud at night and dad
[1:38:20] was trying to go to sleep and I would
[1:38:23] politely yell out down from the from the
[1:38:25] hallway go to sleep you know and they
[1:38:28] wouldn't so they would hear me coming
[1:38:30] and I would open their door and one
[1:38:33] would be kneeling praying the other one
[1:38:35] would be under the covers and I don't
[1:38:37] know where the third one was until they
[1:38:40] told me she would slide in behind the
[1:38:42] door once I opened it and I didn't know
[1:38:43] she was behind the door but I would say
[1:38:46] boy these angels one is praying one is
[1:38:48] sleeping but just a minute ago they were
[1:38:50] making all this noise and I'd go back to
[1:38:52] my bedroom and then later on life they
[1:38:54] told me what they were
[1:38:57] doing if they tried it now I'd be
[1:39:00] worried did did we not do a job a good
[1:39:03] job in growing them up but you know we
[1:39:04] all learned that way we all had to grow
[1:39:07] up by the lessons we learn the things
[1:39:10] don't do that again that hurts don't
[1:39:12] touch that again that
[1:39:14] burns
[1:39:16] now but it must be done in love love
[1:39:21] motive behind the correction needs to be
[1:39:25] love for your benefit for your growth
[1:39:28] for you to be more Christlike for you to
[1:39:31] get to know him more to you to be able
[1:39:33] to be effective to help with a motive of
[1:39:36] love then he says from whom the whole
[1:39:39] body fitly joined together and compacted
[1:39:43] by that which every joint
[1:39:47] supplieth according to the effectual
[1:39:50] working in the measure of every part
[1:39:52] maketh increase of the body unto the
[1:39:56] edifying of itself and again Paul says
[1:39:58] in
[1:40:01] love so looking at that whom the whole
[1:40:04] body fitly joined together and compacted
[1:40:07] by that which every joint
[1:40:12] supplieth every part is needed every
[1:40:16] cell
[1:40:17] every whatever it is I I was listening
[1:40:20] to a brother one day and he was talking
[1:40:22] about how he had gone to the dentist
[1:40:25] because one of the MERS was cracked and
[1:40:27] it was
[1:40:28] hurting so the dentist gave him two
[1:40:30] options he said I can do a crown or I
[1:40:33] can pull it
[1:40:35] out so he asked and he said what's the
[1:40:38] difference 2,000 for the crown and 50
[1:40:41] for the pull so he said pull it for
[1:40:44] $50 and he said but later on I'm eating
[1:40:47] something hard and crunchy and it pokes
[1:40:50] me and I thought to myself oh that I had
[1:40:53] paid for the
[1:40:56] crown and sometimes if we're not careful
[1:40:59] we find ourselves saying oh my Lord had
[1:41:02] I not done that had I done what you said
[1:41:05] had I had let you work through me maybe
[1:41:08] I wouldn't be going through this
[1:41:11] today from whom the whole body fitly
[1:41:14] joined together and compacted by that
[1:41:17] which every joint supplieth
[1:41:21] but I'm just a little nobody but you're
[1:41:24] needed you're part of the body of
[1:41:29] Christ according to the effectual
[1:41:31] working in the measure of every part no
[1:41:35] we can't I can't run on my
[1:41:38] pinky I run using my legs but when I
[1:41:42] take a grip of something my pinky is
[1:41:43] involved with
[1:41:45] that it's what it's supposed to do
[1:41:49] there's a uh you may have seen it in
[1:41:51] Snoopy it's he's he's
[1:41:54] jogging Snoopy from peenuts and all
[1:41:57] these thoughts it's all his body parts
[1:42:01] talking the eyes saying no you really
[1:42:03] need me because you need to see where
[1:42:05] you're going the hands are saying no you
[1:42:06] need me the arm because you need that
[1:42:08] momentum they're going on the heart's
[1:42:09] talking I'm pumping finally the feet say
[1:42:12] would you be quiet I'm carrying all of
[1:42:16] you every part is needed
[1:42:22] and you each one of you are a part of
[1:42:25] the body of
[1:42:26] Christ so this is
[1:42:29] just that part just to
[1:42:32] establish that each one of us is part of
[1:42:35] the body of Christ and each one of us
[1:42:38] has a part to play and each one is
[1:42:42] necessary even if you're young or maybe
[1:42:45] you're getting to the other side
[1:42:49] now and and and and you're looking back
[1:42:51] but you still have a part to play until
[1:42:54] God says we're done it's time to go
[1:42:58] home I enjoy it when uh um some of the
[1:43:04] young people come up here and I say the
[1:43:05] young people some of the the younger
[1:43:07] ones was Sister Angela brought the young
[1:43:09] children to sing it's a joy to to see
[1:43:12] that in all that they're being taught
[1:43:14] they're being brought up that way cuz
[1:43:16] they're going to learn something from
[1:43:19] somewhere my daughter and now works in a
[1:43:21] school with little children
[1:43:23] three-year-olds and things like that and
[1:43:25] little children like that when they can
[1:43:27] talk they will tell you everything
[1:43:28] that's going
[1:43:30] on Rachel my old my youngest daughter
[1:43:33] worked at a
[1:43:34] preschool for I think 7
[1:43:37] years and little little one would come
[1:43:40] in Oh Daddy was hitting Mama again
[1:43:43] today oh this they just spoke what it
[1:43:47] was because it was happening in the home
[1:43:52] I don't think very often did they have
[1:43:54] one come in do you know what Mom and
[1:43:56] Daddy did with me before I came to
[1:43:57] school what they prayed with me they
[1:44:00] read the Bible and they asked God to go
[1:44:02] with me to church to
[1:44:03] school I don't think you hear very much
[1:44:06] of that in in school
[1:44:07] today but oh what a blessing that would
[1:44:10] be for the
[1:44:11] children what a blessing that is for all
[1:44:14] of us when we're lifting one another up
[1:44:17] and helping for the body of Christ to
[1:44:20] grow
[1:44:21] every
[1:44:23] part and one of the things is don't
[1:44:27] compare yourself to another
[1:44:30] part compare yourself to what the word
[1:44:33] of God says about you and say Lord am I
[1:44:37] fitting to have the musicians would come
[1:44:39] up am I fitting to that part am I if not
[1:44:42] hone me some more work with me some more
[1:44:46] until I can be part of that body where
[1:44:48] you say she's whole some complete she's
[1:44:50] she's complete let's go home
[1:44:55] together maybe if the Lord
[1:44:57] allows another
[1:44:59] time we'll get into dealing with more
[1:45:03] how all that works together what some of
[1:45:05] those were me every joint supplieth how
[1:45:08] does that work not so much in a a
[1:45:10] medical way although a lot of it has
[1:45:12] referred to that but rather how we help
[1:45:16] one
[1:45:17] another I know the other day my
[1:45:21] my wife went with a friend of hers to
[1:45:22] have lunch and she lives up on the hill
[1:45:27] Foothills over there and she said oh you
[1:45:28] should have seen the birds they were
[1:45:30] just all over that place and there were
[1:45:33] deer in the backyard and all of this and
[1:45:35] she came so happy because she loves
[1:45:39] those
[1:45:39] things she loves she still sit on our
[1:45:42] window and look at the birds I saw a
[1:45:43] bird with a you know the orange it just
[1:45:45] pleases her makes her happy somebody
[1:45:48] else may be looking at something totally
[1:45:50] different different God knows each part
[1:45:52] of the
[1:45:54] body to each one is
[1:45:56] given as a spirit gives it and you would
[1:45:59] say yes Lord I surrender to that just
[1:46:03] bow our
[1:46:05] heads father your word is is
[1:46:09] true and it's
[1:46:11] unfailing when you cried out on the
[1:46:14] cross it is
[1:46:16] finished every need had been met and
[1:46:19] supplied now we were just watching it
[1:46:21] come into its maturity and its fullness
[1:46:24] Lord we are part of the body of Christ
[1:46:27] not by our own choosing but because you
[1:46:31] chose us you called us as we heard there
[1:46:35] when brother Eli was ministering about
[1:46:37] Peter at the end
[1:46:39] of you're talking to Peter and asking
[1:46:41] him do you love me do you love me Peter
[1:46:45] is thinking and answering yes I love you
[1:46:47] but probably thinking of what had just
[1:46:49] happened and how he had denied you but
[1:46:52] you saw past that and saw that what you
[1:46:55] had placed in
[1:46:57] Peter and you said feed my sheep give
[1:47:00] unto them share with what you have Lord
[1:47:03] let each one of us be willing to do that
[1:47:05] no matter where we're at maybe just a
[1:47:08] simple smile just a good morning or even
[1:47:11] a God bless you something that would be
[1:47:13] a help to somebody that day
[1:47:17] Lord a a a cool drink of water Lord
[1:47:21] maybe just something to eat Lord
[1:47:23] whatever it might
[1:47:25] be Lord we thank you for your love and
[1:47:27] your mercy to us in Jesus Christ's name
