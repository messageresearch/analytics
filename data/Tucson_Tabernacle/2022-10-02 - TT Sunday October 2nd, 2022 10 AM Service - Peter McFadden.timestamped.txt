[25:35] amen
[25:37] he's given us that power amen amen we
[25:40] didn't really have any specific requests
[25:43] turned in
[25:47] Mr Nina the Aaron's daughter wasn't
[25:49] feeling well
[25:50] so let's just remember her in prayer
[25:53] Also let's remember all the saints and
[25:55] Believers in the Florida and Coastline
[25:58] there with the hurricanes and all the
[26:01] different things that is going through
[26:03] the weather events and so forth
[26:05] there's many places that go through a
[26:08] lot of different situations so let's
[26:09] remember each one of them the Lord would
[26:11] grant them mercy and Grace and you might
[26:15] think well that's just the will of the
[26:17] Lord of a storm coming through but Jesus
[26:19] got up in the edge of the boat and said
[26:21] peace be still and he just he just
[26:23] stopped and I think of brother Green's
[26:25] testimony there where he woke up in the
[26:27] middle of the night in British Columbia
[26:28] with brother Branham
[26:30] and he heard brother Brandon praying he
[26:32] said he didn't think brother Brandon
[26:33] knew he was awake
[26:34] or she don't know but
[26:37] Brandon was praying there and he said
[26:39] Lord
[26:41] he said if brother if Perry knew that
[26:43] this that hurricane was coming off the
[26:45] coast of
[26:46] Texas there and his little children were
[26:48] his wife were in in
[26:51] danger he would be all worried Lord but
[26:53] you can just take that storm and send it
[26:55] back out and make it avoid the the coast
[26:58] and
[26:59] they got back two weeks later they're in
[27:01] the middle of British Columbia where
[27:02] there's no internet of course in 1960s
[27:05] and whatnot but
[27:07] they get him back and brother green
[27:08] found out the storm had come right up to
[27:10] the coastline and then just turned
[27:11] around and went back right out into the
[27:12] ocean so Lord can protect us for all the
[27:16] different situations we're in amen
[27:18] amen and even if we go through a storm

[38:17] freedom today
[38:19] amen so it's a good day and it's good to
[38:21] be here
[38:23] let's just read here in Genesis 3 and
[38:27] 14.
[38:30] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[38:33] because thou Hast done this Thou Art
[38:37] cursed above all cattle
[38:39] and above every beast of the field upon
[38:42] thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt
[38:45] thou eat all the days of thy life
[38:48] and I will put enmity between thee and
[38:51] the woman
[38:52] and between thy seed and her seed it
[38:55] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[38:58] bruise his heel
[38:59] and let's go to Mark 16 while you're
[39:01] standing in verse 15.
[39:16] we'll read down to verse 18 Mark 16 and
[39:19] 15.
[39:22] and he said unto them
[39:25] just wait a wait a second here
[39:28] and he said unto them
[39:32] I believe he's not just speaking to them
[39:34] but I believe these are still current
[39:36] words
[39:37] these are still relevant words these are
[39:39] still true words he said unto them
[39:41] go ye into all the world
[39:44] and preach the gospel to every creature
[39:47] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[39:49] be saved
[39:50] but he that believeth not shall be
[39:52] damned
[39:54] and these signs shall follow them with
[39:55] that believe
[39:57] in my name shall they cast out devils
[40:01] you say Amen
[40:03] they shall speak with new tongues
[40:05] they shall take up serpents and if they
[40:08] drink any deadly thing it should not
[40:09] hurt them
[40:10] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[40:13] they shall recover
[40:14] amen God bless you you may be seated
[40:19] I've got a lot of
[40:22] a lot of things that I like to say today
[40:24] but just pray for me that the Lord will
[40:26] help
[40:27] help me and
[40:29] believe that he has something good for
[40:31] us today
[40:32] but uh
[40:34] I hate snakes
[40:36] I think that's a good thing
[40:38] I think you know some people get real
[40:40] friendly to them and maybe that's okay
[40:42] for some people in some circumstances
[40:44] but I hate snakes
[40:46] and yesterday there was a really nice
[40:50] tea party I hear that I was not invited
[40:52] to but that's okay
[40:54] I hear it was good for those that were
[40:56] invited and I'm glad for that and I
[40:58] think those um
[41:01] if I understand right the intention of
[41:03] this was this was a way that the sisters
[41:06] could serve one another and I think
[41:07] that's a beautiful thing I think to to
[41:10] be able to show one another you're
[41:13] you're worth investing time and effort
[41:15] and love into I think that's a beautiful
[41:17] thing and so I'm not even hurt that I
[41:19] wasn't invited that's fine but I was um
[41:22] I got to spend some time with my boys
[41:24] because they weren't invited either
[41:25] and so what we wanted we uh we had to go
[41:29] spend some time
[41:31] and I didn't really get a chance to plan
[41:33] ahead so there I'm sitting outside of
[41:35] the church on my phone well what's going
[41:36] on in Tucson today
[41:39] and
[41:40] what I found that was going on in Tucson
[41:42] today was a exhibition with reptiles and
[41:46] amphibians
[41:48] so me and the three boys said let's go
[41:50] see what reptiles and amphibians we can
[41:52] see
[41:54] so we drove over to the Expo Center and
[41:56] I'd never
[41:57] been to one of these things but I found
[41:59] myself in a big room full of more snakes
[42:01] than I've ever thought about in my life
[42:04] every kind of snake
[42:07] every kind of snake lover there and just
[42:11] all these snakes and all these
[42:12] containers all these little tupperwares
[42:14] all these little plastic containers
[42:18] and
[42:21] so it got me thinking
[42:23] about snakes
[42:25] and what was amazing to me snakes can be
[42:29] small or big but what's amazing to me is
[42:31] how little the containers were that
[42:33] these snakes would fit into you'd have a
[42:36] big old
[42:37] a couple foot snake just in this little
[42:39] thing that's I'd rather add cookies
[42:41] inside which is this little little thing
[42:43] you have this big old snake but it'd be
[42:46] all curled up and and hidden and so if
[42:50] you wanted to you could these a lot of
[42:54] these snakes were for sale
[42:56] hundreds of dollars for these snakes so
[42:58] if you wanted to you could have a big
[42:59] old coat you could buy this snake and
[43:01] that snake and this snake and that snake
[43:02] and you could go out of there
[43:04] with 100 snakes
[43:07] all hidden in your coat
[43:09] I mean these things are collapsible
[43:10] these things are hidable
[43:12] these things are are pocket size for
[43:14] your convenience
[43:20] but I hate snakes
[43:23] and there's a there's an enmity
[43:25] between this serpent in the Garden of
[43:28] Eden
[43:29] and between the sons of God and the
[43:31] daughters of God
[43:35] and we've got
[43:36] Authority
[43:38] we've got power
[43:40] over snakes which is good
[43:43] because I hate snakes but the biggest
[43:45] snake I know is the devil
[43:47] and he was a snake in Genesis and he's a
[43:51] snake all the way to revelation
[43:53] and he's a lion
[43:55] deceiving nasty snake worse than the
[43:59] pythons worse than the Rattlers
[44:02] and he's trying
[44:05] to kill the life out of the Church of
[44:07] God
[44:08] out of those that are are born to be
[44:11] like Jesus
[44:12] he's trying to to kill the life
[44:15] out of that
[44:17] and uh
[44:20] he's pretty good at what he does
[44:22] you know
[44:23] we're not ignorant of his devices we
[44:25] know how he works
[44:27] but I was listening to uh I was
[44:29] listening to a sermon of brother green
[44:31] and he was referencing another sermon
[44:33] where this man got up in a church and he
[44:37] said there's no one like Jesus
[44:40] and everyone said hey man that's right
[44:43] they got excited they said that's a
[44:46] shame
[44:48] we ought to be like Jesus
[44:51] that's that's what this Resurrection is
[44:54] about is that it's not just a
[44:55] resurrection for one but it's a
[44:56] resurrection of many
[44:58] that he's the firstborn among many
[45:00] Brethren and that although he was the
[45:03] only perfect man
[45:05] that could step on all the snakes
[45:09] that could walk above sin
[45:12] it's not going to stay that way
[45:15] but there's coming what the scripture
[45:17] talks about a manifestation of the sons
[45:19] of God
[45:21] that they're going to be just like him
[45:24] and all the way back in in
[45:27] Genesis when God was right in his first
[45:30] Bible in the sky
[45:33] he made two
[45:35] two lights a greater light to Rule the
[45:37] Day in a lesser night light to rule the
[45:39] night
[45:41] and that lesser light has got no light
[45:43] of its own
[45:45] the Moon
[45:46] but it reflects that same original light
[45:49] that same light that shined forth when
[45:52] God separated the light from the
[45:54] darkness and and he started to make this
[45:56] Earth beautiful and bring life to it
[45:59] that same light is what we see in the
[46:02] Moon
[46:04] and I was thinking that you know we've
[46:06] got this promise in Malachi and to you
[46:09] that fear my name the son of
[46:10] righteousness will rise with healing in
[46:13] his wings
[46:15] see the sun rises to those that fear his
[46:18] name
[46:20] right now the world doesn't see that
[46:23] light
[46:24] of the Gospel that light of
[46:26] righteousness the son of righteousness
[46:28] but where that Moon that that we see it
[46:32] it's risen to us the fear his name is
[46:35] this son of righteousness has risen and
[46:38] we've
[46:39] we're being healed by this healing
[46:41] that's in his wings we're being healed
[46:43] in our bodies in our minds
[46:46] in our spirits
[46:48] in our walk
[46:50] we're being healed we're seeing that and
[46:52] as as we bathe in that light from the
[46:55] sun that's not visible here on Earth we
[46:58] reflect that out
[47:00] that those that can't see that sun yet
[47:02] they can see the moon
[47:03] they can see your light and they can
[47:05] know that there is a God
[47:08] you know one of these
[47:11] so these snakes
[47:14] we've got power over them
[47:16] but we could still be bitten
[47:18] these things still come after us we've
[47:20] got our Our Big Brother Paul
[47:23] he was not on an island making a fire
[47:26] and this Viper came in it
[47:29] it got him
[47:30] the power of God didn't keep this Viper
[47:33] uh you know whatever the kova distance 6
[47:36] 10 whatever feet that is you know we'd
[47:38] like that oh no sin in my bubble no
[47:41] snakes no vipers in my bubble no pain
[47:46] but that's not the way it works
[47:48] we're in a battle
[47:50] we're in a fight
[47:52] and these snakes are going to come at us
[47:55] this snake bit him and it probably hurt
[47:59] sin hurts
[48:04] but he had the authority to shake that
[48:07] thing off in the fire
[48:09] and it didn't hurt him
[48:12] so this these uh these
[48:17] these snakes
[48:19] are these Whispering lies of the devil
[48:23] these things that are meant to destroy
[48:25] your faith to destroy your spiritual
[48:26] life
[48:28] and they'll come they'll attack you
[48:33] there's
[48:35] there's two hundred thousand thousand
[48:37] Devils were told that you know that
[48:39] they're not just sitting around but
[48:41] they're busy they're trying to see what
[48:42] they can do who they can bite
[48:46] and one
[48:47] one came to me last night I was trying
[48:50] to study and these doubts come oh well
[48:53] how do you know this how do you know
[48:54] that
[48:55] you know anytime you make a move towards
[48:59] God God will make a move towards you but
[49:02] the devil will also try to stop that
[49:04] they'll try to get in there anywhere he
[49:06] can and so these doubts come well how do
[49:08] you know this is true how do you know
[49:09] this is true
[49:11] and
[49:14] the way that I believe the Lord helped
[49:16] me to shake that thing off in the fire
[49:19] was
[49:20] I thought well how do I know this is
[49:23] true
[49:24] what
[49:26] what do I have that that shows me that
[49:28] this is more than just stories more than
[49:31] just Fables
[49:32] and I thought well let let me see what
[49:34] testimonies
[49:36] I can think on
[49:39] is there any light that I can look to in
[49:41] my day
[49:43] and I watched I was able to to pull up a
[49:45] testimony brother Dwayne Lawson some of
[49:48] the things that he's seen and you know
[49:50] I've sat down to eat with him I've been
[49:51] rock climbing with him I know him to be
[49:54] a faithful Witness
[49:56] and I was able to see God just doing
[49:58] things in his life
[50:02] that at that moment in this fight
[50:05] I couldn't see the sun
[50:08] but I could see the moon
[50:11] I could see that somebody's life
[50:13] was bearing witness of this gospel
[50:16] saying this is true
[50:18] and when we come to church and we come
[50:21] like Jesus and we've come with love in
[50:24] our hearts and we serve one another and
[50:25] we lay down our lives for one another
[50:29] your ministry
[50:31] you're showing that light of the Sun
[50:34] and that light is is a healing light
[50:38] it delivers us
[50:41] but I'm
[50:43] I hate snakes
[50:45] I hate sin
[50:48] because of what it does
[50:51] you know
[50:52] the devil's plan is to have you walk
[50:55] walk around carrying a whole bunch of
[50:57] snakes
[50:58] hidden in your coat somewhere hidden in
[51:00] your pants your shoes whatever your
[51:02] backpack
[51:05] but God's plan for you is to be free
[51:09] to be free not just from Death the end
[51:11] result
[51:12] but to be free from sin
[51:14] that you don't have to be bound up in
[51:16] these say oh it's just a bad habit or
[51:19] you know we make excuses for these
[51:21] things well Nobody's Perfect
[51:25] that's not true
[51:28] the Christian is meant to be perfect
[51:30] in Christ through the shed blood through
[51:33] the Holy Ghost
[51:35] that's where we're going
[51:37] I'm not there yet
[51:40] but that's where I'm going
[51:41] that's where you're going if you'll if
[51:43] you'll endure to the end
[51:45] if you'll keep holding on that's where
[51:47] we're going
[51:49] I believe the Lord wants to set us free
[51:51] from these snakes that we carry around
[51:54] these sins
[51:55] I want so the the the title of my sermon
[51:58] today is power over sin
[52:02] and it comes with a question
[52:04] what will you do with the snake
[52:08] we have power over sin
[52:11] we have the ability to take up serpents
[52:15] but then what we do with the snake it's
[52:17] up to us
[52:20] Paul had this snake on his hand
[52:22] he could have taken it home
[52:24] fed it
[52:25] showed his friends
[52:28] enjoyed this snake
[52:31] or I could throw it in the fire
[52:33] and that's up to you you've been given
[52:35] power
[52:36] to loose the serpent
[52:39] to bind the serpent
[52:41] what are you going to do
[52:42] and it skip all the way to the end
[52:46] do you want to be healed
[52:49] do you want to be free of these snakes
[52:52] or do you want to keep carrying them
[52:54] around
[52:55] and you say well I don't have any snakes
[52:57] in my life
[52:59] well sir Maybe
[53:03] let's let's search our heart let's see
[53:05] is there something
[53:08] that's eating away that life something
[53:10] that's choking out the moving of the
[53:12] spirit
[53:15] in my own life
[53:19] I believe there's things that the Lord's
[53:21] helping me to
[53:22] to fight
[53:24] to get rid of
[53:25] I believe we all have these fights
[53:28] and we we need to
[53:30] we need to get rid of these snakes we
[53:32] were driving along
[53:35] on Friday
[53:37] we saw this
[53:40] this site that would just tug at your
[53:41] heart and it was these two little dogs
[53:43] running around on the road
[53:46] running around free
[53:48] and oh the way your heart Wells up these
[53:51] dogs are gonna get
[53:52] run over
[53:55] if no one
[53:57] gets them to their owner
[54:00] and I thought you know we're so
[54:02] concerned and we stopped and prayed and
[54:04] and oh these these poor dogs they're
[54:07] they're running around in the street
[54:08] they're in danger
[54:12] but we need to have that concern for
[54:15] so many people we see are playing in the
[54:17] street
[54:18] they're running around sin has separated
[54:20] them
[54:21] from the one that cares for them the one
[54:24] that will keep them from danger
[54:28] and that that's what sin does it gets
[54:32] gets these these Souls out there where
[54:35] they're helpless
[54:37] and so it's not just this oh it's a
[54:39] little pet snake
[54:41] but you can't take fire into your bosom
[54:43] and not be burned
[54:45] sin is going to take you farther than
[54:47] you want to go and you get your first
[54:48] snake and it's it's a little gardener
[54:51] snake this thing's pretty harmless
[54:52] nobody ever ever got bit by one of these
[54:57] then it grows and then it's taking more
[55:00] of your time and more of your food and
[55:02] this is this is something in your life
[55:05] and then we can't have just one snake
[55:08] all these all these snake enthusiasts
[55:10] there I don't think any of them had one
[55:11] snake they all had tables full
[55:14] because you get one and then you get
[55:16] another one you get another one and then
[55:18] these ones are boring so you've got to
[55:20] get one a little bit more exciting
[55:22] you've got to get one that's got a
[55:24] little bit more power to it you've got
[55:25] to get something that's uh
[55:28] and it grows and it grows
[55:32] the next thing you know your legion
[55:35] you're bound just with so many big
[55:38] snakes
[55:39] that didn't start out that big
[55:42] but whatever you feed is going to grow
[55:44] and whatever you think on is going to
[55:45] grow in your life
[55:47] in your mind whatever you give your your
[55:50] affections to
[55:52] it's going to be more and more of your
[55:54] life
[55:57] but we had one
[56:00] that came down where none of us could
[56:03] none of us could beat these snakes
[56:08] but we had the one that came down to
[56:09] bruise the head of the snake
[56:12] with Jesus Christ come in the flesh and
[56:14] die on Calvary
[56:16] that he was sin judged he was that snake
[56:19] lifted up that brass serpent that he
[56:22] became sin for us though he knew no sin
[56:24] that we could become the righteousness
[56:27] of God and that's the gospel
[56:30] if the gospel that we're preaching is
[56:32] not a gospel that lets us become the
[56:34] righteousness of God that lets us
[56:36] overcome these snakes in our lives then
[56:38] it's not this original gospel that Paul
[56:41] preached
[56:44] but we're called to be Overcomers
[56:47] I don't want to have any pet snakes
[56:51] I remember when I was in Sunday School
[56:54] long time ago and and the kids would
[56:56] come in and they're talking about their
[56:58] Pokemons
[56:59] the little pocket devils
[57:02] and I said that's wrong we don't talk
[57:04] about that in church
[57:06] and still still true what
[57:10] what are the things that we talk about
[57:12] after church are we talking about
[57:16] how good God is
[57:18] we're talking about the scriptures
[57:20] or we're talking about lost souls
[57:23] we're talking about
[57:24] eternal things
[57:27] were we talking about some some devil
[57:29] that we hold in our pocket to the end of
[57:31] church and then that's all we've been
[57:32] thinking about anyway
[57:34] say and it could be something that looks
[57:37] pretty harmless
[57:38] no it's just fishing
[57:40] just golfing it's just thrifting just
[57:44] whatever it is
[57:47] but if that's taking our time
[57:50] our thoughts our affections
[57:53] is that choking the life out of us
[57:57] and isn't it just another pocket devil
[58:03] but because he lives we live also
[58:08] because he overcame we overcome too
[58:11] and all
[58:13] All Through the Bible God has showed
[58:15] that he has authority over these things
[58:18] and not just he has Authority
[58:21] but a man a woman that surrendered to
[58:25] him also has authority over these things
[58:27] we've got Moses
[58:30] the Egyptians worshiped snakes
[58:33] raw their big sun god
[58:36] he was a snake
[58:39] and here's the miracle with with Moses
[58:41] not just that he threw a stick down it
[58:43] became a snake
[58:46] but he could take that thing up and make
[58:48] it on a snake
[58:50] he had power to bind power to loose
[58:53] he could bind that thing back into a
[58:55] snake I think that's the greater Miracle
[58:56] just to go stick to snake
[58:59] that's pretty great
[59:01] but that's um
[59:03] that's only part of it but can you take
[59:05] a snake and turn it into a stick
[59:13] I think of of Joshua
[59:16] and the promise given to him
[59:18] every place that the soul of your foot
[59:21] will tread upon that I've given to you
[59:24] and so we know footsteps are possession
[59:26] if there's this promised land that we're
[59:29] supposed to walk into but how Joshua
[59:32] taught about this this the Practical lab
[59:36] application of of footsteps or
[59:38] possession
[59:39] he had these men of Israel these
[59:42] captains of the men of War put their
[59:44] foot on the necks of Kings
[59:47] stand on them
[59:49] it's not just about walking through a
[59:51] picnic but it's this is my enemy
[59:54] this is that which is trying to kill my
[59:56] family
[59:58] this is that which is taking my land
[1:00:01] I'm gonna put my foot
[1:00:03] on his neck and we're gonna kill him
[1:00:06] and God's still the same
[1:00:09] his plan then
[1:00:12] his plan now
[1:00:13] total victory
[1:00:15] not just walking through the land and
[1:00:17] these guys can stay but no let's kill
[1:00:19] them
[1:00:21] because if you don't kill them they're
[1:00:22] going to kill you
[1:00:25] we don't make friends with the Enemy
[1:00:29] but this is this is a Time
[1:00:31] to be totally separate from the things
[1:00:33] of the world
[1:00:43] I don't know why anyone would keep a
[1:00:45] snake in in Romans
[1:00:47] well let's go to uh let's go to John 8
[1:00:51] and 31
[1:00:54] we're talking about being free this
[1:00:56] morning
[1:00:58] he set me free
[1:01:01] he set me free but let's walk into it
[1:01:03] let's let that be more than a song but
[1:01:05] let's not be let that be a power in our
[1:01:07] lives
[1:01:13] then said Jesus to these Jews which
[1:01:15] believed on him if you continue in my
[1:01:18] word
[1:01:19] then are you my disciples indeed
[1:01:22] we've got to continue in it we we hear
[1:01:24] John 3 16 for God so loved the world
[1:01:26] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:01:28] whosoever believes in him would not
[1:01:30] perish but have everlasting life amen
[1:01:32] that is true
[1:01:34] but let's continue in it
[1:01:36] let's see what else Jesus taught
[1:01:40] because he taught a lot
[1:01:42] and he doesn't do anything in vain so if
[1:01:44] everything we needed to know was in John
[1:01:46] 3 16 that's all he would have given
[1:01:48] but he gave us more instruction
[1:01:51] he said in verse 32 ye shall know the
[1:01:54] truth
[1:01:55] and the truth shall make you free
[1:01:59] if you want to be free today of these
[1:02:02] snakes if you really want to be whole of
[1:02:03] these things that are are trying to bind
[1:02:05] you up
[1:02:07] we have to know the truth
[1:02:10] the Bible talks about a group of people
[1:02:12] that are ever learning
[1:02:14] but they never come to the knowledge of
[1:02:16] the truth
[1:02:18] because the truth is a person that's not
[1:02:19] how much you you can figure this things
[1:02:21] out but it's do you know Jesus Christ to
[1:02:24] know him is life and if we're just
[1:02:27] learning and we just have doctrines
[1:02:28] added in this and that no this is a nice
[1:02:30] Revelation in this
[1:02:33] will still be bound up
[1:02:35] we'll never be totally free
[1:02:38] but if we'll know Jesus Christ the
[1:02:41] person
[1:02:41] if we'll walk with him
[1:02:45] that's the eternal life
[1:02:48] that's how when we believe on him
[1:02:50] we don't go into the Judgment but we've
[1:02:53] passed from death and I is to know him
[1:02:56] as life
[1:02:57] amen
[1:03:00] the Jews answered him we be Abraham's
[1:03:02] seat we were never in bondage to any man
[1:03:05] snakes are tricky
[1:03:07] these guys are all tied up and they said
[1:03:09] no no
[1:03:10] we're free man
[1:03:13] how safe thou ye shall be made free
[1:03:17] watch it It's Tricky
[1:03:19] but here's what Jesus says
[1:03:21] I'm so glad we have his words his words
[1:03:24] are spirit and their life
[1:03:27] verse 34 Jesus answered them verily
[1:03:30] verily I say to you
[1:03:33] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[1:03:35] of sin
[1:03:36] that was true when he said it and it's
[1:03:38] true now
[1:03:40] if we're still bound up committing these
[1:03:42] sins we're still the servants
[1:03:46] of sin
[1:03:50] the servant abideth not in the house
[1:03:52] forever but the son abideth ever
[1:03:55] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:03:58] ye shall be free indeed
[1:04:03] do you want to be free
[1:04:05] only he can do it
[1:04:09] but he has given us that Authority
[1:04:12] that if we walk in faith
[1:04:16] we will overcome
[1:04:27] Romans 6 16.
[1:04:31] says know ye not that to whom you yield
[1:04:33] yourselves servants to obey
[1:04:36] his servants you are to whom you obey
[1:04:38] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:04:41] obedience unto righteousness
[1:04:43] but God we think that you were the
[1:04:44] Servants of sin
[1:04:46] but you have obeyed from the heart that
[1:04:48] form of Doctrine which is delivered from
[1:04:50] you delivered you
[1:04:52] being then made free from sin
[1:04:55] you're become the Servants of
[1:04:57] righteousness
[1:04:58] I believe that
[1:05:01] I believe that we're being made free
[1:05:03] from sin that this is the work of God in
[1:05:05] our lives
[1:05:07] that he finished the work at Calvary but
[1:05:09] we're still seeing the manifestation
[1:05:13] that were
[1:05:14] were becoming the Servants of
[1:05:16] righteousness there's a growth in a
[1:05:18] Christian's life
[1:05:20] there's the Lord has allowed these
[1:05:23] things like like the brother was talking
[1:05:24] last week about the winds that allow the
[1:05:27] roots to go deeper
[1:05:30] God didn't just empty the promised land
[1:05:32] of all these these Hittites and
[1:05:34] jebusites and everything
[1:05:37] but he let the
[1:05:39] let the sons of God go and fight for
[1:05:43] because it was good for them
[1:05:45] it was something that they needed
[1:05:49] to grow roots to go seek the Lord to
[1:05:51] grow down deepen in Christ and so if you
[1:05:54] say well you said I was free you said go
[1:05:58] go step on the snake and I'm still
[1:06:01] wrestling with it I'll keep wrestling
[1:06:05] just believe
[1:06:08] just keep holding on to the promises of
[1:06:10] God
[1:06:12] we must fight if we must win
[1:06:15] increase my courage Lord
[1:06:19] let us be courageous sons and daughters
[1:06:22] they're going to say well I went and
[1:06:23] tried it and and I I fell again no the
[1:06:27] righteous man
[1:06:29] falls seven times
[1:06:31] but he rises again
[1:06:33] he says no that's my land
[1:06:35] that's my inheritance
[1:06:39] I'm gonna fight for that
[1:06:41] you go down I'll get back up
[1:06:45] it's worth fighting for
[1:06:49] of of whom a man has overcome the same
[1:06:51] he's brought into bondage
[1:06:55] but where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:06:57] there is Liberty
[1:07:00] if we can just
[1:07:02] get in that Spirit of the Lord
[1:07:05] there's liberty there
[1:07:07] there's Freedom there
[1:07:09] that you can Worship the Lord and spirit
[1:07:11] and the truth because he has set us free
[1:07:15] he has taken the The Sting of death
[1:07:19] he overcame
[1:07:23] but Jesus
[1:07:26] is in need
[1:07:28] of a free people
[1:07:32] that's quite a statement to say well
[1:07:34] he's he owns the cattle on a thousand
[1:07:36] hills how can you say he needs something
[1:07:39] let's go to Luke 19.
[1:07:42] and 29.
[1:07:49] Luke 19 and 29 and it came to pass
[1:07:52] when he was come nigh to bethphage and
[1:07:55] Bethany to the Mount called the Mount of
[1:07:57] Olives he sent two of his disciples
[1:08:00] saying go ye into the village over
[1:08:01] against you in which that you're
[1:08:04] entering you shall find a cult tide
[1:08:06] whereon never yet man sat loose him
[1:08:11] and bring him hither
[1:08:13] and if a man asks you why do you loose
[1:08:15] him
[1:08:16] thus shall you say unto him because the
[1:08:19] Lord hath needed him
[1:08:22] and they that were sent with their way
[1:08:24] and found it even as he had said unto
[1:08:26] them
[1:08:27] look at this though
[1:08:30] loose him
[1:08:32] for the Lord half need of him
[1:08:34] this is just I don't know if this was a
[1:08:37] cult or a donkey
[1:08:40] but this wasn't some race winning
[1:08:43] racehorse this was one that nobody ever
[1:08:45] sat on before
[1:08:48] but Jesus needed
[1:08:51] this cult
[1:08:53] because there was a prophecy
[1:08:57] that the Lord Jesus had said it's going
[1:08:59] to be this way
[1:09:00] and so it had to be that way if there
[1:09:03] was no prophecy he wouldn't have needed
[1:09:04] it right
[1:09:05] if there's no prophecy he could have
[1:09:07] just walked
[1:09:08] he could have done whatever
[1:09:09] but he said this is the way it's going
[1:09:11] to be
[1:09:12] and that's the way it had to be
[1:09:15] he's done the same thing in our day he
[1:09:17] said it's going to come
[1:09:20] like this
[1:09:22] there's going to be many songs
[1:09:25] brought to Glory
[1:09:27] there's going to be a bride without spot
[1:09:29] or wrinkle that's made herself ready so
[1:09:31] now because of the prophecy
[1:09:34] God needs somebody
[1:09:37] to fulfill that prophecy
[1:09:41] and we can't fulfill that prophecy if
[1:09:43] we're all bound up if we're still tied
[1:09:45] up this quote could say yes yes I'm
[1:09:47] gonna I'm gonna be the best cult I can
[1:09:50] but until that cult was loosed it could
[1:09:52] not do what was prophesied of it
[1:09:56] and until we'll be loosed of these
[1:09:58] things that are trying so hard to bind
[1:09:59] us
[1:10:01] how can we fulfill these Prophecies of
[1:10:03] us
[1:10:08] same thing with Lazarus he was risen
[1:10:11] from the dead
[1:10:12] but he was all bound up
[1:10:15] Jesus said loose him and let them go
[1:10:19] amen so that's what
[1:10:23] that's why we stay in the word that's
[1:10:25] why we we've come to church
[1:10:28] is because
[1:10:30] it is this word that looses us
[1:10:33] it's the hearing of this word that has
[1:10:36] the power to
[1:10:38] to let us walk on those snakes
[1:10:42] to defeat sin
[1:10:44] and have power over it
[1:10:50] there is a great work for us to do
[1:10:52] in John 14 12 Jesus said verily verily I
[1:10:56] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:10:58] works that I do shall he do also
[1:11:01] and Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:11:03] because I go unto my father
[1:11:07] that's why we're here
[1:11:10] that's why we were born
[1:11:12] that's why we were born again
[1:11:15] is to do the works that he did
[1:11:19] and so we don't have the case we've got
[1:11:21] okay the the groom he's into destroying
[1:11:24] the works of the devil and he came to
[1:11:27] seek and save that which was lost
[1:11:29] and that's what he's about and then
[1:11:31] we've got the bride and she's into
[1:11:35] fill in the blank whatever other thing
[1:11:38] no her mission is his mission
[1:11:41] whatever his heart's about
[1:11:43] that's what her heart's about
[1:11:46] Jesus said and he's our example he's our
[1:11:49] perfect example he said I must be about
[1:11:51] my father's business
[1:11:53] he did nothing but what he saw the
[1:11:55] father doing and that's what the son did
[1:11:56] likewise and that's what we're supposed
[1:11:58] to be
[1:11:59] say father what are you doing because
[1:12:01] that's what I want to do that's what I
[1:12:03] need to do that's why I'm here that's
[1:12:05] how I can be this lesser light to rule
[1:12:09] the night
[1:12:11] these 11th Hour workers I believe we're
[1:12:13] we might be the 11 11th hour or 45
[1:12:16] minute workers
[1:12:19] what were they doing they were working
[1:12:21] the same work that had been going on all
[1:12:23] day
[1:12:24] God's not doing some
[1:12:27] totally different work at the end
[1:12:29] although there are differences
[1:12:32] but the work is still the same I believe
[1:12:34] he's changing the laborers
[1:12:38] but I believe the work is the same
[1:12:40] that if we're about our father's
[1:12:42] business
[1:12:43] we're about destroying the works of the
[1:12:45] devil
[1:12:46] about seeking and saving that which was
[1:12:48] lost
[1:12:52] Jesus said the Harvest is plentiful but
[1:12:55] the workers are few and I think a lot of
[1:12:56] times we get we get discouraged one of
[1:12:59] the promises about
[1:13:01] about Jesus about the Messiah was that
[1:13:03] he would not be discouraged
[1:13:06] that can be our promise too we're part
[1:13:08] of him
[1:13:09] and sometimes we get discouraged and say
[1:13:11] well there's nobody out there they
[1:13:12] wouldn't listen you know we're all
[1:13:14] coming
[1:13:17] Jesus said
[1:13:19] that the Harvest is plentiful it's the
[1:13:21] workers that are few
[1:13:23] should pray that Lord sends workers
[1:13:26] Lord send us use us
[1:13:29] whatever it is we get so focused on the
[1:13:31] 99.
[1:13:34] but God's heart is for the one that's
[1:13:35] gone astray
[1:13:37] more than the 99 that that never left
[1:13:40] God's heart is for that one lost sheep
[1:13:43] that gone astray and there's more
[1:13:44] rejoicing of that one sheep that comes
[1:13:47] back and comes and gets the snakes
[1:13:49] pulled off
[1:13:52] then of 99 people said well we're still
[1:13:55] here we're still doing pretty good we're
[1:13:57] still holy and righteous
[1:14:00] that's not where God's heart is
[1:14:02] God's heart is
[1:14:04] where is that lost one running around on
[1:14:06] the road where is that one that's going
[1:14:08] to get plastered by sin
[1:14:10] if somebody doesn't reach down in love
[1:14:13] and show the light of that son of
[1:14:15] righteousness and say there's healing in
[1:14:17] his wings
[1:14:18] he cares for you
[1:14:20] you don't have to live like this
[1:14:23] you don't have to see sin is gruesome
[1:14:25] and bad and we we make excuses for it
[1:14:28] but there was a king in Israel
[1:14:31] that send I forget his name but the last
[1:14:34] thing he saw before his eyes were put
[1:14:36] out were his sons be killed before him
[1:14:40] and that's what sin always does
[1:14:43] is that
[1:14:44] as we sin we fail the ones that we love
[1:14:50] and we'll watch them die spiritually
[1:14:54] but even if that's happened he is the
[1:14:57] resurrection and the life
[1:15:00] though a man be dead yet can he live if
[1:15:02] we'll believe on him
[1:15:04] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:15:09] we have power to bind power to lose
[1:15:12] but if we don't use that power to loose
[1:15:15] it will be too bound up to do anything
[1:15:19] but the Lord has need
[1:15:22] of a free people
[1:15:26] he's a man of war
[1:15:28] and so we're called to be like him we're
[1:15:30] called to be a people of War
[1:15:32] this is in Exodus it says the Lord is a
[1:15:35] man of Hope of war the Lord is his name
[1:15:40] we're Fighters
[1:15:43] we're snake Stompers
[1:15:48] in Ezekiel
[1:15:50] I was reading
[1:15:51] and the Lord shows the prophets
[1:15:54] all these snakes that are going on in
[1:15:56] the church
[1:15:58] says come and see this and he gives them
[1:16:00] the inside view
[1:16:01] everything looked alright on the outside
[1:16:03] but there were there are serious sins
[1:16:05] going on
[1:16:06] this group was was weeping for this God
[1:16:09] and this group was worshiping the Sun
[1:16:11] and
[1:16:12] these people were bound up in sin
[1:16:16] and what what was told then
[1:16:19] is that there was to be a mark on those
[1:16:22] that sigh and cry for the Abominations
[1:16:24] that are done in the midst thereof and
[1:16:26] everybody else was going to be slain
[1:16:28] young and old maids and maids and
[1:16:30] children and it says begin at My
[1:16:32] Sanctuary
[1:16:34] if we don't get rid of these snakes
[1:16:39] it's very serious
[1:16:41] it starts here
[1:16:42] it starts in the house of God
[1:16:45] that God knows what we're hiding God
[1:16:47] knows what we're what we're feeding what
[1:16:49] we're holding on to what we think that
[1:16:50] we're powerful enough to keep it alive
[1:16:52] in our lives
[1:16:55] don't mess with that
[1:16:58] don't be
[1:17:00] part in part out
[1:17:04] We Believe Christ is the Ark in this day
[1:17:06] that there's another destruction coming
[1:17:10] and this Ark was covered people talk
[1:17:14] about Perfect Pitch this Arc had Perfect
[1:17:16] Pitch it kept everything out
[1:17:20] kept everything that was supposed to be
[1:17:21] in in kept everything that was supposed
[1:17:24] to be out
[1:17:26] if we'll get into Christ
[1:17:29] and just stay there
[1:17:32] that's what we're called to do
[1:17:34] then these sins they won't be able to
[1:17:37] get in
[1:17:39] that if we know
[1:17:41] the truth the truth will set us free
[1:17:46] this truth is Jesus yes he's the one
[1:17:49] he's the rock he's the only one
[1:17:53] like this verse that I've been
[1:17:55] just chewing on except we abide in him
[1:17:59] we can do nothing
[1:18:09] in
[1:18:11] in John 13 8
[1:18:16] here's a man
[1:18:18] that has been through a lot with Jesus
[1:18:20] he's heard all the sermons
[1:18:23] he's cast out devils
[1:18:26] he's eaten communion
[1:18:31] but then he says
[1:18:34] you'll never wash my feet
[1:18:37] and I believe Jesus answered him is the
[1:18:40] same answer that we have today
[1:18:43] if I wash thee not thou Hast no part
[1:18:45] with me
[1:18:48] if we won't humble ourselves to the
[1:18:50] washing of the Water by the word
[1:18:53] to be clean every wit
[1:18:57] we have no part with him
[1:19:00] Jesus can't use a cult that's all tied
[1:19:02] up
[1:19:07] but we're to
[1:19:09] we're to make straight the paths for our
[1:19:11] feet
[1:19:12] or to pursue peace and holiness
[1:19:14] without which no man can see God
[1:19:21] but see the way this works the great
[1:19:24] thing about a snake
[1:19:27] so if you step on the head
[1:19:31] the rest of it loses its power
[1:19:36] and that head we're told is unbelief
[1:19:39] that these all these other things that
[1:19:41] are in our lives
[1:19:43] they come from this unbelief
[1:19:48] these things that come in
[1:19:50] these Prides these hatreds of our
[1:19:52] brother These Eyes of lusts that can't
[1:19:55] cease from adultery
[1:19:57] these these uh
[1:20:00] putting on of garments
[1:20:02] that pertain to a man
[1:20:04] putting on of makeup The Cutting of the
[1:20:05] hair these things
[1:20:07] we still believe those right
[1:20:11] we still believe that the adorning
[1:20:13] should be of a a Meek and quiet Spirit
[1:20:17] which is in the sight of God is a great
[1:20:19] price
[1:20:20] that our women are to be dressed in
[1:20:22] modest apparel
[1:20:25] the men are are to stand with backbone
[1:20:28] and fight for what's right
[1:20:30] put up with sin we still believe those
[1:20:32] right
[1:20:34] we still believe that we can't have the
[1:20:37] the grace of God the faith of the Lord
[1:20:40] Jesus Christ with of
[1:20:42] with respective persons
[1:20:44] that when somebody comes in and their
[1:20:46] clothes aren't so good
[1:20:47] we're supposed to just treat them just
[1:20:50] as good if it was the king himself
[1:20:53] sometimes we entertain angels unawares
[1:20:58] so we've got a lot of different areas
[1:21:00] that there are snakes in our lives
[1:21:02] a lot of things a lot of
[1:21:05] things of the world the music that's got
[1:21:07] this snake-like power
[1:21:10] to choke the life out of us
[1:21:12] the wrong podcast the wrong things that
[1:21:14] we could watch or read
[1:21:17] those are still snakes
[1:21:20] maybe we don't preach about them all the
[1:21:22] time
[1:21:23] but those are still snakes and they're
[1:21:24] still trying to kill you
[1:21:26] they're still trying to kill me
[1:21:34] for Luke 10 19
[1:21:37] is a promise
[1:21:39] for us
[1:21:41] Luke 10 19 says behold I give you power
[1:21:45] I give unto you power to tread on
[1:21:48] serpents and scorpions
[1:21:50] and overall the power of the enemy
[1:21:53] whatever that snake is whatever
[1:21:56] say well what's your what's your
[1:21:58] favorite sin
[1:22:00] what's your favorite snake what's your
[1:22:02] favorite devil
[1:22:03] what's the one that's troubling you
[1:22:07] start with that one
[1:22:11] because that's the one that's going to
[1:22:12] cost you
[1:22:14] say well I'm good on all these
[1:22:17] I've got 99 of my sheep are great what's
[1:22:20] the one percent of your life that's gone
[1:22:22] astray
[1:22:23] let's go there
[1:22:26] that's what God cares about
[1:22:28] not the 99 points in your life that are
[1:22:31] ducks in a row
[1:22:33] what's that one sheep in your life
[1:22:35] that's gone astray
[1:22:37] Jesus says I give you power over all the
[1:22:41] power of the enemy whatever it is
[1:22:44] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:22:49] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that
[1:22:51] the spirits are subject unto you but
[1:22:52] rather Rejoice because your names are
[1:22:54] written in heaven
[1:22:56] the wages of sin is still death
[1:23:01] whatever sin we let in our lives is
[1:23:03] going to bring death in one form or
[1:23:05] another
[1:23:08] but we've got power over it
[1:23:15] but the way that we've got to do that
[1:23:18] is by faith in his word
[1:23:21] you know that there was a lunatic
[1:23:22] brought to the disciples
[1:23:24] fell off into the fire in the water
[1:23:27] and brought this guy to the disciples
[1:23:29] and they said heal him
[1:23:31] they couldn't do it
[1:23:33] and Jesus rebuked them
[1:23:36] and then this is Matthew 17 19.
[1:23:39] the disciples came to Jesus apart and
[1:23:41] said why could we not cast him out and I
[1:23:43] think that's a good question if there's
[1:23:44] a snake in our life
[1:23:46] that's been there for a long time and
[1:23:48] we're fighting with this thing well
[1:23:50] what's going on
[1:23:52] why can't we get rid of this thing
[1:23:55] what do we have in our life that's the
[1:23:56] same thing that we've been fighting for
[1:23:58] days weeks months years
[1:24:01] God what's going on
[1:24:04] why aren't we being healed
[1:24:07] we know that you're the son of
[1:24:09] righteousness was healing in your wings
[1:24:12] why am I still Bound by this sin
[1:24:16] and Jesus said unto them because of your
[1:24:18] unbelief
[1:24:20] for verily I say unto you if you have
[1:24:22] faith as a grain of mustard seed
[1:24:26] and shall see unto this mountain remove
[1:24:28] hence Beyond replace it shall remove
[1:24:31] this is still true
[1:24:33] this is still for you that will believe
[1:24:39] that if we'll speak it in faith
[1:24:42] say devil get out of my life
[1:24:45] it will remove
[1:24:47] and nothing shall be impossible unto you
[1:24:50] I'll be at the sky and goeth not out but
[1:24:52] by prayer and fasting
[1:25:07] in John 5 and 5
[1:25:10] a certain man was there by the pool of
[1:25:12] Bethesda which had an infirmity 30 and
[1:25:15] eight years and Jesus saw him lie
[1:25:18] and knew that he had been now a long
[1:25:20] time in that case
[1:25:23] a lot of our ailments are not new
[1:25:24] ailments it's the same old snake
[1:25:28] think back five years were you fighting
[1:25:30] with the same thing you're fighting now
[1:25:34] he says he's saith on him
[1:25:37] wilt thou be made whole
[1:25:41] how much do you want it
[1:25:44] do you really want it
[1:25:48] here was the testimony that I listened
[1:25:50] to that was an encouragement to me
[1:25:53] brother Wayne was over in India
[1:25:56] and he was preaching
[1:25:59] and this woman
[1:26:01] fell down she rose up and I think she
[1:26:03] fell down and and she was
[1:26:05] she was demon-possessed it was
[1:26:07] essentially what it was
[1:26:11] sticking her tongue out and different
[1:26:12] things
[1:26:14] she was really
[1:26:16] bound up with a snake
[1:26:19] they prayed for her
[1:26:21] they went and cast that devil out
[1:26:24] because this word is still powerful
[1:26:26] and she fell down that's when she fell
[1:26:29] down she was she rose up and was acting
[1:26:31] demonic they prayed for her she fell
[1:26:33] down and they woke her up and she was in
[1:26:36] her right mind she was free
[1:26:40] then they go to a different city
[1:26:43] they come and there's another demonic
[1:26:45] Spirit on a woman
[1:26:47] so both stories have the same start and
[1:26:50] this thing in a prayer line it's it's
[1:26:52] kicking and it's fighting it's against
[1:26:55] them
[1:26:57] and they they pray for this woman
[1:27:01] and she passes out too
[1:27:03] the stories are the same up here
[1:27:06] but they wake her up and she comes up
[1:27:08] with the same
[1:27:09] more of the same
[1:27:11] these things are real
[1:27:13] this isn't the boogeyman or spooky scary
[1:27:15] but
[1:27:17] there are snakes that we can't see
[1:27:22] she comes up the same thing and they're
[1:27:24] they're praying for they're praying
[1:27:26] trying to intercede for her
[1:27:29] and eventually the Lord revealed
[1:27:31] to brother Wayne
[1:27:33] that she worshiped that thing
[1:27:36] she didn't really want it to be gone
[1:27:39] she didn't really want to be free
[1:27:41] you say how ridiculous here she is and
[1:27:45] in the presence of the god that made her
[1:27:49] that's willing to loose her
[1:27:52] and she would hold on to this nasty
[1:27:54] devil
[1:27:56] but don't we do the same sometimes
[1:28:00] don't we make excuses and say it's not
[1:28:02] that bad
[1:28:03] I've got this one under control
[1:28:08] it before it kills you
[1:28:10] the wages of sin or death and if you
[1:28:13] want God to use you
[1:28:16] let him wash you
[1:28:19] let him loose you let him heal you
[1:28:23] say well
[1:28:26] I really do want to be delivered
[1:28:31] you know this word tells us how to be
[1:28:33] healed
[1:28:34] and if there's something that you've
[1:28:36] been fighting for a long time have you
[1:28:38] tried this prescription
[1:28:41] James 5 16 says confess your faults one
[1:28:44] to another
[1:28:46] and pray one for another that you may be
[1:28:48] healed
[1:28:49] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:28:51] righteous man of Health much
[1:28:53] we like to quote that last part say well
[1:28:56] I'll just effectually pray and be
[1:28:58] righteous
[1:28:59] sometimes we need the first part it's
[1:29:01] been there for a reason too
[1:29:04] if you're fighting with this thing you
[1:29:06] can't get loose to it
[1:29:08] this is a way that you can be healed
[1:29:10] say brother
[1:29:12] sister
[1:29:14] I hate this snake so much
[1:29:18] that I want to be accountable
[1:29:20] I want to get this thing out of my life
[1:29:23] I want you to pray with me I want you to
[1:29:24] pray for me
[1:29:26] expose this thing
[1:29:33] how much do we hate this snake
[1:29:36] do we just hate it enough to get rid of
[1:29:38] it if we can get rid of it without
[1:29:39] looking
[1:29:41] without being embarrassed
[1:29:43] without looking like we don't have all
[1:29:44] our ducks in a row
[1:29:47] well we uh
[1:29:49] we only look for that lost sheep if we
[1:29:51] can do it well while still appearing to
[1:29:52] have all hundred rounded up
[1:29:56] or we come to the place
[1:29:59] or wherever like Samson
[1:30:02] we say I don't care
[1:30:04] if it kills me
[1:30:07] I've got to have Revenge
[1:30:09] on this my enemy
[1:30:11] let me die with the Philistines
[1:30:14] and if we get there if we'll get to the
[1:30:16] place where we don't care what happens
[1:30:17] to us but say no these snakes have got
[1:30:19] to die
[1:30:21] I'm gonna expose these I'm going to
[1:30:24] confess my sins I'm not just going to
[1:30:25] say Lord sorry for my sins
[1:30:28] what sins are you sorry for
[1:30:31] are you willing to make them right do
[1:30:34] you want to be healed
[1:30:38] when Samson got that way he slew more in
[1:30:40] his death
[1:30:42] and all they that were slow that he slew
[1:30:44] in his life
[1:30:46] I believe we'll really get to that place
[1:30:49] we'll say Lord
[1:30:52] your kingdom come on this Earth
[1:30:55] as in heaven
[1:31:00] I believe we'll see prophecy fulfilled
[1:31:05] I believe we'll see demons craft Sabbath
[1:31:07] I believe we'll see the sick heals the
[1:31:09] dead raised spiritually physically
[1:31:11] whatever it is
[1:31:15] but Jesus needs
[1:31:18] a loosed call
[1:31:21] do you want to be loose
[1:31:24] I want to
[1:31:25] I'll tell you I've been confessing
[1:31:27] things I've been telling my wife look
[1:31:29] I'm struggling with this I'm struggling
[1:31:31] with that
[1:31:32] because I believe that that's how I'm
[1:31:34] being healed
[1:31:37] is to say Lord what is it that I'm still
[1:31:40] fighting with
[1:31:41] what is it that my unbelief
[1:31:44] is keeping in my life
[1:31:50] but now is the day of salvation
[1:31:53] now is the time
[1:31:58] Hebrews 3 and 7.
[1:32:10] wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith
[1:32:13] today if you will hear his voice
[1:32:17] is he speaking to you today is there
[1:32:20] anybody here that
[1:32:21] yes Lord I hear you
[1:32:24] have you heard him say that in your life
[1:32:27] needs to go
[1:32:30] if you'll hear his voice
[1:32:32] Harden out your hearts as in the
[1:32:34] provocation
[1:32:36] in the day of Temptation in the
[1:32:37] wilderness
[1:32:39] when your father's tempted me prove me
[1:32:41] and saw my Works 40 years
[1:32:44] wherefore I was grieved with that
[1:32:45] generation and said they do always err
[1:32:47] in their heart and have not known my
[1:32:49] ways
[1:32:50] they were bound up
[1:32:52] because they didn't know the truth
[1:32:56] they didn't really know
[1:32:58] the person
[1:33:00] so I swear in my wrath they shall not
[1:33:03] enter into my rest
[1:33:05] unless I wash you you have no pardon me
[1:33:09] take heed Brethren watch out
[1:33:11] lest there being any one of you an evil
[1:33:13] heart of unbelief
[1:33:15] in departing from the Living God
[1:33:20] going astray
[1:33:22] where once you were free do you remember
[1:33:24] when you were at this altar you were
[1:33:25] free
[1:33:27] he broke all the chains you saw Calvary
[1:33:31] said yes Lord
[1:33:33] thank you
[1:33:35] thank you for bruising the head of that
[1:33:37] serpent
[1:33:40] don't depart from that don't depart from
[1:33:43] this living God
[1:33:44] but exhort one another daily
[1:33:47] that's what I'm trying to do
[1:33:49] I'm not trying to be anything or lift
[1:33:52] myself up but I'm saying brother
[1:33:54] sister remember when God gave you power
[1:33:57] over serpents
[1:33:59] that's for a reason
[1:34:00] exhort one another daily while it is
[1:34:02] called today lest any one of you be
[1:34:04] hardened
[1:34:06] through the deceitfulness of sin
[1:34:09] for we are made partakers of Christ
[1:34:13] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:34:15] confidence steadfast unto the end
[1:34:18] artists said today if you will hear his
[1:34:21] voice Harden out your heart says in the
[1:34:23] provocation
[1:34:25] for someone they heard did provoke how
[1:34:27] be it not all
[1:34:29] that came out of Egypt with by Moses but
[1:34:32] with whom was he grieved 40 years was it
[1:34:34] not with them that had sinned whose
[1:34:37] carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:34:39] and to whom swear he that they should
[1:34:41] not enter into his rest
[1:34:43] but unto them that believe not
[1:34:45] so we see that they could not enter in
[1:34:47] because of unbelief
[1:34:49] that's the head of the snake right we've
[1:34:52] been called out
[1:34:54] where the church that called out
[1:34:57] been wandering in the wilderness a long
[1:34:59] time
[1:35:01] but do you believe that there's an
[1:35:02] entering in for you
[1:35:04] do you believe it's not just being
[1:35:05] called out of
[1:35:07] denominational systems out of the ideas
[1:35:09] of man but do you believe that we are
[1:35:11] more than able to take the land that we
[1:35:13] can go in we can put our feet on the
[1:35:15] necks of these Kings
[1:35:18] have the victory
[1:35:21] don't Harden your heart don't don't pull
[1:35:24] away from God don't fall into unbelief
[1:35:29] say oh God I believe
[1:35:33] God wash me God loose me
[1:35:36] I believe
[1:35:38] that I'm to be free
[1:35:41] that who the sun sets free is free
[1:35:43] indeed oh that can be any that could be
[1:35:45] all of us
[1:35:47] if we just know him
[1:35:49] to know him is life
[1:35:51] is freedom
[1:35:53] it's for you
[1:35:56] we're called to walk in these promises
[1:35:58] of God
[1:36:00] cast down imaginations and every High
[1:36:02] thing that exalts itself against the
[1:36:04] knowledge of God and to bring into
[1:36:05] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:36:07] of Christ
[1:36:09] that's for you
[1:36:10] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:36:14] how can we do that by the Holy Ghost by
[1:36:17] his spirit
[1:36:18] by surrendering
[1:36:21] by looking to him
[1:36:25] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:36:28] he is the one that perfects us
[1:36:31] but he does it by his word
[1:36:33] and he doesn't bull you into it
[1:36:36] he says
[1:36:37] here it is
[1:36:39] is this what you want
[1:36:41] or you want something else
[1:36:44] what is your desire
[1:36:47] do you want to be made whole
[1:36:51] we have a promise
[1:36:53] if we resist the devil he'll he'll flee
[1:36:55] from us
[1:37:02] so if he isn't fleeing
[1:37:05] maybe we don't have the faith to really
[1:37:07] resist
[1:37:09] maybe we don't hate the thing enough to
[1:37:10] really push back
[1:37:12] you might have to resist every day
[1:37:15] you might have to push back but this
[1:37:17] thing shouldn't be growing in your life
[1:37:19] out of cactus once that I was trying to
[1:37:21] get rid of and I hacked everything off
[1:37:23] of it
[1:37:24] came back up
[1:37:26] and I hacked everything off of it and it
[1:37:27] came back up and I hacked everything up
[1:37:30] eventually it died
[1:37:34] but if this Cactus is bigger now than it
[1:37:36] was
[1:37:39] yesterday
[1:37:41] a year ago
[1:37:42] keep hacking
[1:37:44] keep fighting get to the root of that
[1:37:46] say Lord where do I not believe your
[1:37:47] word
[1:37:48] where is there an unbelief that would
[1:37:50] cause me to pull back from your presence
[1:37:52] for his in your presence there is
[1:37:53] freedom where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:37:55] there is Liberty
[1:37:58] and that's our inheritance
[1:38:00] that we can come boldly into his
[1:38:02] presence you don't have to wait for
[1:38:03] Sunday to Sunday to come into His
[1:38:05] presence but every day
[1:38:08] go boldly in say Lord you're a man of
[1:38:11] war
[1:38:12] and I'm in a battle
[1:38:14] father put your arm around me
[1:38:17] father bind up my wounds
[1:38:20] give me Vision to see what I need to
[1:38:22] fight today
[1:38:25] he wants to show you he wants to guide
[1:38:27] us
[1:38:28] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:38:30] they are the sons of God they are the
[1:38:32] daughters of God
[1:38:37] the son has risen to us
[1:38:40] we can see the son of righteousness
[1:38:45] are we going to fulfill that
[1:38:47] the world would see this manifestation
[1:38:50] that the whole creation's groaning for
[1:38:55] to see us
[1:38:57] do the works that Christ did
[1:39:00] not just the Miracles
[1:39:02] but to live above sin
[1:39:06] every promise in the book is mine amen
[1:39:10] Peter said at Thy word Lord
[1:39:13] don't make it too complicated
[1:39:15] there's a
[1:39:18] there's a pamphlet I was reading and
[1:39:21] it's talking about you don't need to
[1:39:23] make it so complicated and
[1:39:26] say oh well I'm going to go fast for 40
[1:39:28] days and I'm gonna do this great thing
[1:39:30] that thing
[1:39:32] just take God at his word
[1:39:36] Just Surrender it to him
[1:39:40] just say Lord help out my unbelief
[1:39:44] it's not some great
[1:39:46] things so far out there
[1:39:48] it's right Within Reach
[1:39:50] if you want to reach out and touch it if
[1:39:52] you want to reach out
[1:39:54] and claim that if you want to step out
[1:39:56] in faith and put your foot on that neck
[1:39:59] that thing that's been bothering you
[1:40:02] that's for you
[1:40:03] if the musicians would come let's put up
[1:40:07] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 and we'll
[1:40:11] we'll close with this
[1:40:19] says therefore leaving the principles of
[1:40:21] the doctrine of Christ let us go on
[1:40:25] unto perfection
[1:40:30] do you believe that
[1:40:34] I believe that's for us
[1:40:39] not laying again the foundation of
[1:40:41] repentance from dead works and Faith
[1:40:44] toward God we keep that Foundation
[1:40:48] but God's Building a building on top of
[1:40:51] that Foundation he's building a
[1:40:52] tabernacle for his holy spirit
[1:40:56] the doctrine of baptisms and of laying
[1:40:59] on of hands under the resurrection of
[1:41:01] the dead and of Eternal judgment for
[1:41:03] this
[1:41:05] will we do if God permit
[1:41:07] but it is impossible for those that were
[1:41:10] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:41:12] Heavenly gift
[1:41:14] or made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:17] and have tasted the good word of God and
[1:41:19] the powers
[1:41:20] of the world to come
[1:41:22] if they should fall away
[1:41:24] to renew them again unto repentance
[1:41:27] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[1:41:29] son of God afresh
[1:41:31] put him to an open shame
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:36] keep fighting
[1:41:40] Don't Fall Away
[1:41:44] don't just say I've been fighting this
[1:41:46] too long and I've fallen too many times
[1:41:51] we give up that's when we crucify him
[1:41:53] afresh
[1:41:55] that our sins
[1:41:58] this is a heavy scripture
[1:42:00] but I believe we gotta keep the whole
[1:42:03] Council of God in our mind
[1:42:05] foreign
[1:42:06] there's going to be a people that
[1:42:09] they tasted of the Heavenly gifts they
[1:42:11] were partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:13] they started well but they were made
[1:42:16] Shipwrecked
[1:42:18] because they didn't let the Lord
[1:42:20] wash them and loose them
[1:42:22] [Music]

[1:42:36] you have power to bind it
[1:42:38] you have power to step on its neck to
[1:42:40] believe God's word
[1:42:42] or you can keep it hidden
[1:42:46] let it grow in your life
[1:42:49] what are you going to do with it

[1:47:08] Paul writes in the scripture he says I
[1:47:10] Die daily
[1:47:12] constant battle
[1:47:15] until we're changed from this Mortal to
[1:47:17] that immortal
[1:47:18] but the scripture doesn't say you have
[1:47:21] to be overcome by it no you overcome it
[1:47:25] when that man came up challenged brother
[1:47:27] Branham I believe I was up in Washington
[1:47:31] it comes all the way and that spirit is
[1:47:33] cast out and
[1:47:36] they asked brother Brown why didn't you
[1:47:38] why didn't you do that and he says no
[1:47:39] that man worships
[1:47:43] and we when we give it when we feed it
[1:47:45] when we get paid heat to it we do we
[1:47:48] just strengthen it
[1:47:50] I was playing golf one time and with a
[1:47:53] just walked on and the guy told me he
[1:47:57] said it was the first time I played golf
[1:47:58] in six months and I said why he said
[1:48:00] because I was standing on the edge and a
[1:48:02] little rattlesnake bit me
[1:48:04] in the ankle he said for six months I
[1:48:07] couldn't do nothing
[1:48:09] they say the small snakes inject all the
[1:48:12] Venom
[1:48:14] the older snakes knows how to play with
[1:48:17] you
[1:48:19] they give you a little bit here and they
[1:48:20] give you a little bit there just to hold
[1:48:22] you captive
[1:48:24] they don't inject it all at one time
[1:48:28] Lord I don't want any of it
[1:48:30] none of it
[1:48:32] I wanna if it's if it's something like
[1:48:34] that I want to step on it and get it
[1:48:36] over with now

[1:48:41] I'll make an excuse well I'm just a man
[1:48:43] and men are tempted that way
[1:48:45] greater is he that is in you
[1:48:48] than he that is in the world
[1:48:50] that's where you stand and as quickly I
[1:48:54] know brother Branham shared this with
[1:48:56] brother green brother green shared with
[1:48:57] as quickly as you can make it right
[1:49:01] don't let it Fester don't let it grow
[1:49:04] in in as husband and wife as as parents
[1:49:07] with children as brothers or sisters

[1:49:11] until it gets a little too embarrassing
[1:49:14] a little too hard to make it right but
[1:49:16] as quick as you can as quick as you can
[1:49:19] get a hold of yourself say Lord I'm
[1:49:21] sorry
[1:49:22] I'd want to make it right Lord we we I
[1:49:25] think we could all raise our hands today

[1:49:34] when we go to the doctor and when we're
[1:49:37] having some some issues in our life we
[1:49:39] we don't go to the doctor just because
[1:49:41] we want to go to the doctor but we go
[1:49:43] because there's an issue something going
[1:49:44] on
[1:49:45] our body is reacting in a way we're
[1:49:48] showing some type of symptom Lord and
[1:49:50] and the doctor sits down and they begin
[1:49:52] to examine us and they look and they
[1:49:54] they check the blood and they check your
[1:49:57] temperature and and your heartbeat and
