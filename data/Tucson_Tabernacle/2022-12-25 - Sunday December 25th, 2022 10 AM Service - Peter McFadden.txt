great Resurrection we worship you for how you were brought into this world we worship you for the life you lived the atonement you provided for all of us in this actually for the sins of the world

to as you offer yourself [Music] to us we want to offer ourselves to you this morning we could think of no better prayer than to ask you to help us to open up all the doors that are in our heart this morning every single one we'd ask that that great resurrection power would be upon the speaker but that that same anointing would be on the audience and that together you would be able to accomplish your will here on Earth as it is in heaven that's our reason for being here and so that you can change us Lord and so that you could make us Lord be fulfilled the purpose that you've given us would you do that Lord we would be so joyful and happy if you would accomplish that this morning that's what we want we thank you for the stripes you took for these requests for healing we're mindful of the pain you must have suffered for these two requests in particular which are spoken and those that are unspoken in the audience for Divine Healing as we pray this prayer Lord would you go and anoint the faith that's in the heart of the people to move under the anointing of those stripes that you provided would you do that Lord and Lord finally we just want to conclude this prayer Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and would you help us all of us to give ourselves to you this morning and to let you change us from the inside out it'd be a great joy in our life if you would do that in the

concerning Church business brother Peter's going to be ministering this morning a little Christmas message and then he'll be given his vision for the church if he's elected pastor Wednesday night this

Lord and love you and love your word and father more than anything we want your spirit to move Lord and that it wouldn't just move by without us recognizing it but Lord that we would perceive you as you pass by and Lord that we would just surrender lay down everything in our lives and in our hearts father that you would be glorified that you would receive all glory and honor father all praise Lord this is our desire that you would be that you would have the total preeminence this morning and every day of Our Lives father till he call us home To Be With You Lord we believe it soon we don't know how many days we have left but Lord this day let it be yours father you've made it you've made our ourselves Lord and we're your children Lord the Sheep of your pasture fetus father as only you can Lord close my lips anoint them Lord anoint the ears of the year that we could have a wonderful time in your presence father for where your spirit is there's liberty Lord there's healing faith and joy thank you Father in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you can get a Merry Christmas anywhere but if you come here you can get a God bless you and I think I don't know exactly how they rank but I think God bless these uh that's the one I want amen but uh while you're standing I really appreciate everyone being here um let's just turn to Isaiah chapter 40. and we'll read verses one to five while we're standing and I'll keep standing all right Isaiah chapter 40. verse 1. how many is in need of comfort this morning anybody there's comfort in this book for you it says come for ye this is Isaiah 40 chapter Isaiah chapter 40 verse 1 come for ye come for ye my people saith your God speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her Warfare is accomplished and her iniquity is pardoned for she is received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God every Valley shall be exalted and every mountain and Hill shall be made low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough place is playing and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it amen and let's while you're standing also go to the Book of Matthew and we'll read chapter 2 and verse 11 in the Book of Matthew and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they'd opened the treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh hey man you may be seated this is a little bit different of a morning for me and so let me just say a few things and then we'll just preach okay so we'll just take a minute here and just say a few things um and the first thing that I like to say is if there's any sort of perception that what's going on here is me versus brother Daniel that's false that's of the devil that's not the way it is but the Daniels my brother and I believe that he would call me his brother and we just both want the Lord's will and we want to see I believe uh each one here and those that aren't here prosper and draw near to God and be filled with the Holy Ghost and so wherever that voice wherever that feeling would come in that oh there's this there's this politicking there's this campaign there's this you know who's who's gonna who's gonna you know step up and who's gonna step down we're all here to exalt the Lord Jesus to lift him up and the only way that can happen is if it were all step down humble ourselves and and come on our knees to the foot of the cross and so just let's let's kill that right now that that's sort of a spirit of of conflict and emulations that's not what's going on here um the other thing that I like to just say real quick um I approved the way that the the announcement was was written and at the time I thought it was you know exactly right and then just some some little things that maybe I the more that I thought about I thought a little bit differently and one of them is that in the announcement it said that I would present my vision for the church if I'm elected pastor and first off we're gonna have a vote for brother Daniel first so don't even don't even think of me until we get there and and just um just keep me in your prayers but um what I'm going to preach today I'm not going to preach and then give a vision I'm just gonna preach and in there I believe you'll see my heart and you'll see what my vision is so I'm not gonna you know split this up but I'm just gonna preach the word of God and I believe you'll see my heart and you'll see what I'm what I'm looking to um and the other thing is that this isn't my vision if I become pastor but this is just what I believe that the Lord's shown me for today and what I believe would be good and helpful for us as a body as a group of people seeking the Lord Jesus Christ and so this isn't um copyrighted this is mine and and brother Daniel can have this this is just what I believe is true and I believe it's true whoever's pastor and I believe that every word in here is yea and amen and it's all good and it's not well these are my scriptures and these are your scriptures but no let's let's just take all this book and let's Worship the Lord Jesus let's do our best just to to let this word this Living Word have the preeminence so now that's out of the way let's just have church let's just preach let's just look to the Lord Jesus and um this maybe is a little bit of a different kind of Christmas message but I've been thinking a lot about this myrrh that the wise men brought and so I was really encouraged when I talked to brother Ed in the back and he talked about these wise men these Magi Magi I don't know how you say it but they brought these gifts to the Lord Jesus and even as a young child one of the gifts that they brought him was this myrrh This Bitter perfume this prophecy of a death to come and and so I I thought about being real real punny and saying well this isn't a Merry Christmas this is a Murray Christmas but I don't want to be jokey I want to be sincere and myrrh is not you know a jokey lighthearted subject but it's death it's the way that they get myrrh it's it's this ointment that comes from a tree that it's not something that you know falls down from the North Pole with Christmas elves and Jingle Bells but the way that they get Myrrh is there's this tree that in the tree is healing for the tree there's this this sap this life blood of the tree is to keep the tree healthy and to keep the tree alive and this sap is for the tree and what they do is they come and they wound this tree they'll come and they'll drive spikes into it they'll cut it and that healing comes out what's inside comes out when you're wounded when you when somebody strikes you you find out what's inside how do you scream out do you scream out oh let Fire come down from heaven on you or do you say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and this tree something about this tree something about the healing that's in this tree when it's wounded and when it's injured that comes out and other people can take it and they can use it and and it's got medicinal purposes and it's got good fragrance because this this tree was wounded and what comes out from it now can be used to help others this healing that was for the tree now it's for others and so I believe that as we look to this Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world we a lot of times around this time of year we just like to look at at the baby side of things and just the the cute and the nice and happy side of things but when our lord Jesus was born he was born to die he came into this world to to destroy the works of the devil and he came to do that by offering giving himself as an offering for sin you can get this idea that he was just this you know just this good man that they came and killed and there's a truth to that but more than just this good man that was killed he said no man could take my life from me but I lay it down I give it it wasn't just that he was going around doing good and they snuck up and killed him but no his entire purpose his entire reason that he came was to lay his life down to give his life for you and me that in this world though we have tribulation we can have joy in the good times and the bad times and in the Happy Times the dark times when it's when it's night that we can say Oh Our Savior came and gave us life eternal he gave us a way but the way that he'd given us is the way that he walked and so he didn't come and and live in one way and then say okay now just um sing some happy songs and and I'm getting a little bit of feedback so maybe I just need to speak up I'll try to speak up a little bit um but he called us to follow him he called us to live this way that when we're born again of the spirit the gift that would be appropriate would be myrrh for us as well that we're born of the spirit to lay down our lives for one another that we could have such love for our friends that see my death is is not the sort of Redemptive death of the Son of God Jesus Christ when I lay my life down there's not that same atonement that can be made but if we'll lay our lives down one for another that's part of God's plan that's part of the way that this healing blood of Jesus Christ that now flows in our veins that's part of how this this life is expressed out that the people that are out there they need this life and unless the tree is wounded they can't come out it'll just stay inside and we'll have good for us you know good good life good healing but this was given to us that it it can go out from us that we can be the light of the world and so I want to read Isaiah 54 or 53 and I've got a lot of scriptures to just pull and pray the Lord help us because I was thinking last night well this could be my first four-hour sermon and then I don't know uh I don't know how many friends I would have after that so let's just trust the Lord and believe that he'll help us today but Isaiah 53 if I have a vision I pray that it's always a vision of Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever and so if I have a vision maybe it would be this Isaiah 53 says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no Beauty that we should desire him this gospel is in the gospel of outward Beauty we can twist it and make it beautiful and and make it hip and and cool but this man Jesus Christ when you really see him there's no Beauty there outwardly there's an inner beauty of holiness but he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not and so when you say I want to follow this Lord Jesus I want to be a Christian I want to to go and walk in his footsteps you can only walk in those footsteps if you become like him if you take his nature these steps are not footsteps that can be walked with our old human nature but to walk to follow after him we must become this we must live in such a way that we're despised and rejected of men we must become men and women of Sorrows and acquainted with grief we all want to get to Easter we all want to get to Resurrection and we all want to get to Pentecost but the road there leaves leads to Gethsemane leads to Calvary and if we would want our lives to be good lives if we want our church to be a good church where people can be healed and people can receive what they need it's not going to come without a sacrifice without a dying to ourselves without a crucifixion of this flesh surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him smitten they're stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth to that nature of Christ the ability to keep quiet sometimes that takes all the character in the world just to keep quiet did he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before his sheer her shears is dumb so he opened on his mouth see the one thing we're in this time of sheep and goats right sheep and goats they're eating the same thing but a sheep will be led of the spirit of God to the slaughter the Sheep will go there a goat might go a little way and it's going to jump out of the chute he's not going to go all the way but that nature of a lamb that's the only nature that that Dove of the Holy Ghost will come and stay on that nature of a dove of a lamb will go all the way lay his life down he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation he was cut off from the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth she when we're reading this we're reading this about the Messiah but we're reading this as what we must become that let it be said of us there's no deceit in their mouth whatever we say Let It Be True Let It Be genuine there's the spirit that you know I have to fight this this joking and this Folly and this Frolic and just say something because it it was good for the moment but let us be lovers of the truth lovers of the truth when it's on our side and lovers of the truth when it cuts us like a knife let there be no deceit found in our mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when he shall make his soul an offer him for sin he shall see his seed any of his seat here this morning he sees you he knows you he's not forgotten you should prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many any Justified today how did that come was it just through good preaching just through you know some some superficial love know our justification came through that awful day on Calvary to that terrible sacrifice for us he should bear their iniquities and if we're his children will bear one another's burdens yes when one of us sins we won't just condemn them be quick to write them off and condemn them but will restore such a wonder and a spirit of meekness we don't just bear each other's burdens as you know just in the physical but if there's a spiritual need Among Us if there's somebody that's got a wrong Spirit see Jesus even turned to Peter and he said get thee behind me Satan sometimes you'll see in your brother or sister say well that's the devil you get ready just uh all right I'm gonna cut your head off I'm going to feed you to the birds right but no Jesus loved Peter he prayed for Peter let's be that way when you see iniquity in your brother your sister say oh God please help them to see it how can I lay my life down more that they can see you how can I provoke them to love and good works therefore because of this because of all those things that came before this therefore I will divide him a portion with degree you want to portion with the Great here's the map here's the way and he shall divide the store spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death are we willing to do that to pour out our soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressor transgressors and bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors sometimes we've even just got to let ourselves look like the bad guy just be numbered with the transgressors we don't have to go fight for our you know make sure our reputation stays good if they spit on us if they hate us than to do the same to our Lord we don't have to go and and plead our own cause but vengeance is mine says the Lord he'll recompense he'll fight for us but we've got to be like that Lamb of God that's the only way that I see forward and and I'd love to see a church that just filled with the Holy Ghost and on fire and and just people coming to the altar people coming to be saved and coming to be healed but I think this is the way there is that we've got to get sincere we've got to get humble and I believe I was looking I couldn't find it but I believe I've heard that I believe I've heard it said that we've gone as far as we're going to go with God until we're willing to to pay a greater sacrifice so we'll be willing to be like Samson and just say let me now die with my enemies but let your name be glorified and just willing to bring down the whole thing though it cost us our death that there could be victory for the Lord's people and that's the only way that I see forward in John chapter 12 and verse 20 we know that there were certain Greeks among them Where She Came To Worship at the feast the same came there for the Philip which was the which was of bethsaida of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus and really every person that you meet whether they know it or not that's what they're looking for they're looking for what we claim to have what we sing about what we come and and say that our lives is all about they're coming in there saying we would like to see him is it true is there any anything to this is it all just talk and smoke and mirrors when somebody comes in these doors they're not coming I hope to to see and hear us but they're coming to see Jesus and that's the only thing that'll help them not the best of our intentions and the best of our wisdom and the best of our programming and organization but if they can see Jesus they can be changed they could be set free and they can walk a newness of life and Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified they're thinking oh good this this sounds nice we've been waiting for this he says verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die that abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit that was true then and it's true now that if we want to see spiritual growth and we want to see people added to the kingdom it's not enough just to be wheat say well I've got I've got it all you know I'm pure perfect wheat got it all figured out I've got the right spirit and everything unless that fall into the ground and die that abides alone and so if that's all we want it's just too bad alone then carry on we're okay but if we want to see God multiply this seed and we want to see our loved ones receive what we've been given it's not going to happen unless we die unless we lay down our lives if Jesus didn't have a way around this how can we if the Son of God the perfect sinless one needed to die how can we be as followers and just walking not go to Calvary he says he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be If any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled foreign what you're hearing in this Bible if it never troubles your soul maybe you need some ice to have because these words they cut Like a Knife they cut away things from your life that you thought were part of you but they're not part of you and it it hurts and it's uncomfortable and it's supposed to be that way it has to be that way we can never be formed into His Image if we're not willing to let go the way that we are my soul is troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour is that is that our prayer no there's got to be some other way save us from this but for this cause came I into this hour that's why we were born of the spirit that's why we're here father glorify thy name Lord take me through Gethsemane don't take me to Calvary they'll have to lay down everything in my life father glorify thy name and there came also a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again and the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said of angels speak to him Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes this isn't just for the Lord Jesus this is for our sakes now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out that's what I want to have happen here is I want every Antichrist Spirit every Spirit that's not magnifying the Lord Jesus let's cast it out in my life let's cast it out everything that would bring hatred and strife let's cast it out but here's what I wanted to get to in verse 32. he says and I if I be lifted up from the Earth will draw all men unto me if we want to bring people to Lord Jesus we must lift him up whatever else we do could be good could be bad that's okay but we must lift up the Lord Jesus if we're to draw men to him and this he said signifying what death he should die there's no way to magnify and to lift up the Lord Jesus if we're also trying to magnify and lift up our flesh if we're trying to keep a good image for ourselves alive no flesh will lower in his presence we have a choice we can either lift up the Lord Jesus through our death or we can kill the word of God and lift ourselves up and so just like pilate said what shall I do with this Jesus he asked the crowd I've got this Jesus what do I do with him I said crucify him and that's always the answer of the flesh that's always the answer of the crowd unless the spirit of God moves because everyone loves baby Jesus but when he comes and he starts convicting men of sin he starts calling people whitewashed tombs and he starts saying if you'd known the prophets you'd know me things get uncomfortable people don't like to be uncomfortable they want to marry Christmas at all costs let's just be happy if it makes you happy it can't be bad that's the spirit of the sage just do what makes you happy it all work out it's not true we have One Life to Live with one opportunity to follow in the footsteps of our Lord Jesus so I was thinking I was going to read all that before I had you sit down aren't you glad I had you sit down that was going to be my opening two scriptures so maybe I'm learning that's why I switched to the other two I was thinking though about this Christmas thing right this is the day that's Christmas and so it was first going to be announced I was going to preach a Christmas message and I don't know what a Christmas message is like I I just I don't know um but I was thinking we believe that Christ was born with the Lambs in the spring just thinking well what is this time of year all about what is this Christmas about and and really if you look up the history of it it's a lot of pagan activity right a lot of of Hooten and hollering and worshiping the Sun and that sort of thing because on Wednesday it was the shortest day of the year and so it's it's the the days get shorter and shorter and then you get to this solstice time where then the light starts returning and so this Christmas the roots of it are people watching the Sun and saying okay something's going on and then whenever we see something that's going on we say okay we've gotta we've got to do something about this right the the universe needs our help hear the the sun's going away and and so we'd better go Hoot and Holler and light some fires and and get the sun to come back that's paganism right but I believe that God gave the light in heaven for signs and seasons for days and years so whatever's happening in the heavens there is some meaning to it there is something that's going on and so when we look at this this time we don't want to be like the heathens and we don't want to have a pagan approach to this where we say okay the light's going away and now we've got to go and and jump and holler and get the light to come back the light's coming back God God set this all in order son in its place the Earth's gone in its place the light's coming back we don't have to go and Hoot and Holler and make it happen and cut ourselves that's um that's bail worship when you cut yourselves and you you try to you know just Bend bend the the lights to obey you but there is something to do when it's dark and I thought of Jesus in Gethsemane praying the light's coming back but there's one group that they're just trying to to work something up there's another group that's sleeping that's the disciples just well times are times are not great wake me up when things are better two extremes right ones no come back son come on got the others ah it's okay see you in the morning that you got the Lord Jesus pray he's watching he's pouring out his soul unto death so in this dark time I believe the light's coming I believe there's coming a day a real glorious day but it's not in our ability to work things up come and whatever we do but let's be ready let's make ourselves ready let's be clothed in the righteousness of God let's be laying aside every sin and every weight and the things that you so easily beset us let's seek the Lord let's see if there's somebody that we can in another time of great darkness in the land in Egypt in Goshen it was a time to try to bring people in underneath the blood maybe we're okay and we could just spend the night sleeping but let's look out the window and see is one of our neighbors somebody that could be persuaded to come under the blood as one of our loved ones gone outside the light's coming but what we do here in the night is important too not to work ourselves up and cut ourselves with knives but just like Jesus did he found in prayer but he could get to the place where he'd say not my will but thine be done that's all we need to do it's not this self-crucifixion it's not well let me go find 10 ways to appear real holy and and okay I'm not um not washing my clothes anymore that might might be holy yeah that's just uncomfortable and stinky but what we need to come to is a place for our own will has been crucified we're not crucifying you know we're not actually going and driving spikes in our hands but we need to come to that place where we say not my will of God let thine be done whatever you do you slay me yet I'll trust you I will follow you wherever you lead for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God not anything else but will you follow will you be led these are perilous times These are times that we don't believe every Spirit but we try the spirits whether they be of God this is a time when the spirits are so close that it'll deceive the very elect if it were possible and so it's easy to say well I'm Alexa it's not possible going to bed I'll see you but I believe part of the reason the elect's not deceived is because the elect loves the truth and they love the voice of the shepherd and they've got to be where they can hear his voice and feel his spirit that's why they can't be deceived greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world I mean it's not a time to be scared it's not a time to oh me is the sun going to come back the sun's coming back don't worry we'll hold them to the hand of God and don't believe any spirit will make sure it lines up with this word not just a couple verses here or there but make sure it goes all the way through Genesis revelation you can take see the letters killeth but the spirit gives life you can take any any portion of this and you could just go around killing people you know killing your neighbor well you're not right you're feeling here but what we need more than anything is the spirit of God to move because he's the only one that can open this book and divide it out in the right timing in the right spirit in the right way and so where you've got in the beginning you've got the Earth without form and void there was nothing the Earth could do to get out of that condition all the earth's best tricks and and whatever get all the dinosaurs to go over on this side and jump in unison wouldn't matter but it took the spirit of God brooding over the Earth moving upon the face of the waters and separating dividing the light from the darkness that's what it'll take for this church to be a success whatever we do let's allow that Spirit to move let's not grieve the spirit away with our unbelief with our insincerity and with our hatred and strife we could have everything good but if we don't have the spirit of life it's nothing I heard a story it was about Walt Disney one of the there see there's so much uh you say he's going to preach about Walt Disney well hmm not good well let's let's think about this this is the world of fakes this is the world of counterfeits this man Walt Disney was one of the first ones to realize that you could make something that's not real look interestingly real and so that I heard this story where he was building this um most magical place on Earth or whatever this this place this this little kingdom and he wanted to have some birds there what's a kingdom without birds so he had these fake birds and they were really really good fake Birds every feather was just right and the way that they were these these scientists and Engineers really studied to get just the best fake bird the world had ever seen and so they're all impressed and they're with themselves and they're ready to show this guy Walt Disney look at this bird isn't this just great and he says it's not breathing won't work and they said well uh people won't notice that he says people can feel perfection and sometimes real people can sense that genuine so I think what they did is they went and put in some sort of actuator to get these guys to breathe I don't know but to me that's still a fake bird I don't want a fake bird I don't want us to get to the place where okay we've got every feather is just right and every every fingernail and everything's just right over to churches and breathing oh this is a problem oh let's put in some sort of motor let's let's get a good music program make it seem like we're breathing no let's just let the spirit move let's just call in the name of the Lord and humble ourselves and turn our face towards heaven let's just repent of our sins see a broken and contrast Spirit he will not despise you say oh Lord where is your spirit well let's come the right way let's humble ourselves let's really love one another let's not have secret things hidden in our lives we've got the store of Aiken that this one man's sin this one man's hidden thing in his life caused his friends his brothers to die I believe we're coming back to the full sincerity of the Gospel to where we can't afford to have these hidden things that we've had these snakes that we've allowed just to keep us pet snakes I believe we need the spirit of God moving more than anything foreign so that's that's what I think our step one is get the spirit moving now by working it up not by oh let's make it look like we're breathing you know let's receive the Holy Ghost let's let it lead us to death to lead our lives for one another because if we can do that it doesn't matter really for a good preacher a good singer or whatever when the spirit of the Lord really came down to the Temple of Solomon the ministers couldn't even minister it didn't matter if he was a good speaker or not or you know if you had a nice tie but the spirit of God was moving I believe that's what we need for God to breathe into our nostrils the Breath of Life just like he breathed into Adam we're coming we're being built up into a habitation for this Holy One but unless he actually lives here it's just a house yes it's just walls let's make him welcome let's receive him into our hearts today let this Christmas be Christmas that we really really sincerely say oh God be it unto me according to your word to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven so don't get discouraged when you know where we're at and and what you see right now it's for a reason this word It Cuts Like a Knife but it also says comfort you comfort ye my people he also says she's already received from the Lord's hand double for her sins I believe though there's an anointing on us right now it says prepare the way for the Lord he's coming Let's Straighten Up let's make the the mountains High let's make the mountains low let's let's prepare for him to come maybe his spirit's not moving yet like we want it to move but how can we get ready how can we get out of the way how can we prepare a Manger if all we got for him to to be in our house we don't have a nice bassinet or whatever you whatever you'd like to have let's make our manger the best that we can for him whatever we've got let's let's make it ready that we can say Lord I don't have much but all that I have is yours if we're so in tears we'll reap enjoy if we'll go forth weeping bearing precious seed well doubtless come again rejoice and bear in our sheaves with us but we can't get to the joy we can't get to the sheaves without the Weeping without the sowing Without Really following the Lord Jesus matters what we do and matters how we do it we don't want to just realize the ark's got to get from here to here and and the cart would be a nice way to do it you know let's seek the Lord say Lord we know where we need to go show us how to do it lead us Lord because otherwise people are going to die people are going to get hurt it's not just you know Blaze ahead and and try something out and see if it works no we we have an example I love what brother Daniel said about this this leader of the Louisville fire department that he he was up ahead and and people could follow him I believe that that leader is the Lord Jesus Christ and our job isn't to run ahead of him but our job is to point to him and say oh Lord Jesus I can see where you were lifted up I want to follow you and that's our job is not to go and Blaze a new Trail but to point to the one who's gone on before it's important to the captain of our salvation the first born among many brethren we're not going to have victory in a different way than he had victory but if we'll just follow he's the only mediator between God and man we take a lot of times the scripture that Paul told Timothy in in First Corinthians 11 1 and he says be followers of me even as I also am of Christ and that's true and I believe that and I think sometimes we only look at that partially and we kind of take it to say well at least myself let me just be honest with you guys sometimes I take that and just say well Paul had it figured out you're saying Timothy I'm pretty much there I've got to pretty much figured out so if you'll just do what I'm doing you'll be okay Timothy I think that's the way at least I interpret it sometimes right it's somebody that's got it mostly figured out and just do what they do and that's close enough but I believe there's more to this scripture than that and I believe in this scripture be followers of me even as I also of Christ I believe this is a prophecy of two deaths because Paul's story wasn't over when he wrote this but where he was following Christ was to lay his life down for this gospel that he was martyred I believe he was beheaded and Paul's following of Christ was not just I've got the right Doctrine I've got the right spirit it was Timothy I'm gonna die for this just like Jesus died for you and Timothy when that happens don't give up don't lose Heart Don't Run Away follow me as I follow Christ you can do the same and Timothy did Timothy was martyred as well and so it's not just this easy oh find a good man and do what he's doing but it's Jesus is the good man and we know what he did and that's where we're called that's where we're called to follow Paul Timothy and each one of us the way that we do that is different now there's different ways that we've got to fulfill different parts of the scripture and it may be that not one of us has a gun held to our head says are you a Christian are you not that may never happen to any of us but each one of us still has to choose will we lay our life down or will we keep part of it back I've got a I've got a contractual agreement that they the sales people call it life insurance well that's just a sales gimmick it's actually death insurance they don't pay me nothing if I keep on living but this life insurance thing it's not worth a penny to me or to my wife or my family unless I actually do the thing that I've contractually agreed to do which is to die and if I can do that my wife will be a rich woman if I don't do that she's not getting a dime and that's the way a lot of these promises are is that there are powerful promises powerful things that will happen for the believer if we'll just lay our lives down if we'll crucify our will the life insurance company doesn't care if you're mostly dead they want a scientific declaration there are no signs of life in this this guy Pete don't worry about him he's he's really dead then she gets the money are we willing to go all the way of this Jesus said in Matthew 16. and 24 and then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it what does a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul and what shall a man give in exchange for his soul in Romans 6 verse 3. he says know you not that so many of us as we're baptized into Christ into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death don't you know when we get baptized up here that's what we're saying that will be with him in death will be with him in Resurrection that will love not our lives to the death therefore we are buried with him by baptism unto death but see it doesn't end there don't fear going into the valley of the shadow of death you're not going to stay there it's though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of death there's a promised land on the other side of Jordan for us death is a doorway into the promises of God to the land of the Holy Ghost where God can move it doesn't end just with being buried in baptism but if we're buried within in by baptism unto death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life so once the jet crosses that sound barrier can do incredible things once we can get away from our own ability that we can cash in on that life insurance policy we can see God move and we can see God heal and and discern spirits and raise the Dead but we've got to go through God's provided way walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection amen that corner wheat doesn't stay in the ground rotten Undead but it's planted there is a resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin dropping down into Romans 8 18. this this this goes all through Romans it's not just oh well you know you're just taking a couple scriptures out of context now go back and read it go back and read Romans and see if this isn't what Paul is talking about he says in Romans 8 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature weighed us for the manifestation of the sons of God verse 22 it says for we know the whole creation groaneth and travieth and pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wet the Redemption of our body are we groaning like that do we just say oh yeah that's me and then we go home and we're like totally satisfied totally happy with the way we are totally fine with the amount of the spirits moving in our lives we're in our service saying oh God I need something of life to burst forth from this dead seed and I'm not rotted enough yet Lord there's still something in me that's keeping that life from bursting forth oh God I've got the down payment I've received your Holy Ghost to the sea but Lord glorify thy name let it spring forth I believe there's a people that's groaning for that and the devil tries to mask that tries to distract us away from that smoke and mirrors and balls and get you looking at oh this one's wrong and this one's wrong now look to Jesus just keep your eyes on him don't look to the winds and the waves just walk to him then Romans 12 1 says I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service this is the gospel of Jesus Christ this is the gospel that Paul said If any man preaches any other gospel then what I've preach unto you let him be accursed there's no life outside of this there's no good news out of this follow Christ yes you'll have to go through death but you'll share in his resurrection you'll share in his life but everything else outside of that is the spirit of antichrist and it's the spirit of Cain worship it just says let's let's fake a breathing bird let's make it look really pretty what is there life there is there death there is there Godly sincerity it's the word of God being received as it was spoken or are we twisting in some way when they wandered in the wilderness before they could cross over they had to circumcise their children they had to make sure that everyone was ready to go over I believe now we're getting ready this is a time that we're to go into Christ into these promises of God we need to make sure have we got the Holy Ghost have we put away all the things of the flesh have we have we let worldliness creep back in have we let our disputations and murmurines quenched the moving of the spirit of God or are we totally surrendered totally ready to have the Lord move he said circumcise the foreskin of your heart he said to obey is better than sacrifice and a hearken than the fat of lambs it says in Matthew that within Jesus Old Country he did not many mighty works there because of his unbelief what move into the spirit are we hindering by our unbelief by the thing is that we just won't let go of the areas in our lives that we just won't die let's let's go to Mark 10 and 35. I don't think I have a full three hours left don't worry we get like this sometimes like James and John the sons of Zebedee that came unto him saying master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we desire isn't that our kind of religion sometimes God will you give me whatever I want he'll give you what's good for you and he said unto them what would you that I should do for you they said to him Grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on my left hand in my glory Jesus said but Jesus said unto them you know not what you ask can you drink of the cup that I drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with and I think that's a great question for each one of us say oh God I want to be with you I want to be like you but are we willing to drink the cup are we willing to take that baptism they said unto him we can and Jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of see this wasn't just a rhetorical question this wasn't just well could you oh it's not for you don't worry he says you're gonna drink it and with the baptism that I'm baptized with all shall you be baptized he's not giving them a different Holy Ghost than he's given us he's not giving them a different cup than he's given us but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with James and John but Jesus called them to him and said unto them you know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise Authority upon them but so shall not be among you these are Jesus words but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant to all you say okay well that's for the pastor that's for all of us can we be the footwash flunky can we be the one that says what do you need brother sister how can I help how can I minister to you not tell you you're wrong and here's why but how can I love you how can I wash your feet with my tears and dry your feet with my hair for the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many that's if the musicians would come I've got more but let's go to First John 3 and 14. if this seems heavy to you this seems like well count me out if that's it I can't do it the word of God says there hath no temptation taking you but such as common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you were able but what would the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear if you desire to drink this cup to be baptized with this baptism this is for whosoever will this is for those that will say yes Lord I receive it let's let's read here in First John 3 and 14. it says we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we love the brethren this is how we check up say God where am I at am I where I need to be have I laid my life down do you love your brother do you love your sister he that loveth not his brother abideth and death still something needs to die something needs to arrive whosoever hateth his brother as a murderer and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren [Music] it's not just giving your life to give it just for the sake of let me let me show what a Christian I am we lay our lives down for the brother [Music] that we can give healing that we can give strength [Music] that somebody can eat of the Fruit of the Spirit rest underneath the shade but whoso hath this world's good and see if his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in Word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth do you want to love like that if you can love like that I don't know if you'll have a Merry Christmas but I believe you'll have a good Easter I believe you'll have a wonderful Pentecost I believe your brothers and your sisters well thank God for you whatever happens I love you I'll pray for you don't fear there's no fear in love but perfect love casts out all fear so we don't need to be afraid we just look to Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith he's gone on before we just have to follow him let's stand and pray let's really pray dear Jesus you've shown us the way Lord You're our example our perfect example help us to walk after your ways Lord to follow after you Lord we cannot do it Lord without your spirit so I pray o God that you'd baptize us each one with your spirit a new Lord and anything that's that's crept in anywhere that we've backed through the Lord anywhere that our love has grown cold father circumcising in the foreskin of our hearts father and let us love you with all that we are and love our neighbors ourselves father that you would be glorified in the Tucson Tabernacle and in our lives father have your way Lord we thank you that this isn't your gospel is never bad news Lord but your gospel is always good news Lord It's always a comfort to us do it though it convicts us Lord and though it causes us Lord to groan and and say oh God so Lord we're so thankful for it for your word Lord for your truth bless each one I pray thank you for it Lord in Jesus name amen [Music] sing that song the more that I Surrender the lighter my load amen I know people probably have places to be but if you want to just stay and sing to the Lord worship if you want to stay and pray uh this is a House of Prayer this is a place that

another but talk to him and be led by by the Lord so and just quickly no service tonight it's been canceled and and then on Wednesday evening will be questions and answers for Brother Dan Brother Peter so we need to have those questions in writing in time for them to look be able to see them and and meditate on those questions and then meeting on Sunday mornings so if you need to go God bless you and if not if you would stay just for a short time and just yield your heart to the Lord and and just say Lord direct us lead us I'll be willing to set myself aside for the good of the church

is possible that this cup that I have to go through this this yielding of myself this giving of myself completely is there another way to do this but then you humbled yourself and you said not my will thy will be done Lord and Lord each one of us has thoughts each one of us just things that we would we would love to see and how we the Lord we want to yield ourselves completely are in Salem not my will but thy will be done Lord and then as as you express your will to us Lord that we'd be willing to say yes Lord where you lead I will follow God and Father just help us this coming week we as
