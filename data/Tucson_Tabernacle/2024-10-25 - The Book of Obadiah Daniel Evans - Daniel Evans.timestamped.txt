[30:47] been here before Wednesday night we
[30:49] dedicate to a Bible study and brother
[30:52] Lyall and I go back and forth and uh we
[30:55] started in Genesis and we're all the way
[30:58] to the book that everybody knows that
[31:03] what that's it's almost everybody's
[31:04] favorite book in the Old Testament it's
[31:09] Obadiah right does everybody know what
[31:11] Obadiah is about it's the shortest book
[31:14] in the Old Testament it's only one
[31:17] chapter and it's actually a tremendously
[31:23] interesting book it's it's um
[31:28] it has some really really great lessons
[31:30] in it it it talks about it's it's
[31:33] addressed not to the normal audience
[31:37] it's addressed to these people called
[31:39] the it's addressed to the
[31:41] people of Edom so we have to understand
[31:44] who these people from Edom are and we
[31:47] have to understand the context of the
[31:50] book so the book starts out and and what
[31:52] had happened is these had
[31:56] betrayed their brothers in Israel there
[31:59] was a great attack that came from
[32:02] another country most Scholars think that
[32:06] it is the attack of
[32:09] Nebuchadnezzar that came in and
[32:12] destroyed the temple and took all of the
[32:16] captives and brought them back to
[32:19] Babylon and these
[32:22] who we're going to find out are
[32:24] related to the Israelites they sat there
[32:28] and they watched it happen and they
[32:31] didn't help their Brethren and not only
[32:33] that when the Israelites tried to
[32:37] escape they actually went after the
[32:39] Israelites and grabbed them and and held
[32:42] them so that the Invaders could take
[32:46] them
[32:47] captive so they really betrayed their
[32:51] Brethren and this is a prophecy to those
[32:55] people it's in two parts the first
[32:58] 15 verses are directed to Edom and then
[33:03] the rest of the book is directed to
[33:06] really everyone and it has a lot of
[33:09] pride in there and um has a lot of as I
[33:12] said a lot of lessons it's um it's it's
[33:17] really it's a unique book and to
[33:21] understand it we have to understand some
[33:23] history now brother ly and I have spent
[33:26] a lot of time on the Bible and
[33:30] explaining where these people Israel
[33:33] came from because pretty much every book
[33:36] every book in the Bible refers back to
[33:39] the Israelites so who are
[33:42] they and what is their significance so
[33:46] we see this man we in the Book of
[33:47] Genesis we see this man named
[33:51] Abraham God visits him the Bible says
[33:55] he's a friend of God God
[33:58] God gives him a promise even though he's
[34:02] his wife is Barren he has no children
[34:04] gives him a pro promise and said you are
[34:06] going to be the father of many
[34:08] nations promises him that he's going to
[34:11] have this land that's beyond the Jordan
[34:14] River
[34:16] and that his offspring will inhabit that
[34:19] land and that's pretty much what the
[34:21] whole Bible's about after that it talks
[34:24] about this group of people that come
[34:26] from this descendant of Abraham
[34:28] so Abraham then by a miracle he has a
[34:31] son named
[34:33] Isaac then Isaac has two sons
[34:38] Twins and those are firstborn is Esau
[34:42] and the second born is
[34:45] Jacob Jacob's name is changed to Israel
[34:51] so now we have the country of Israel and
[34:54] the rest of the Bible is pretty much
[34:56] about that group of people that come
[34:58] from Jacob so it's the sons of Jacob are
[35:01] also the sons of Israel the children of
[35:03] Israel that is who that is but this
[35:05] other guy
[35:07] Esau he was blessed
[35:10] also and he his lineage is called the
[35:15] or Edom so we have to
[35:19] understand that to properly understand
[35:21] this book of Obadiah
[35:25] now when ES and Jacob were born and
[35:29] we're going to read the scripture that
[35:30] they were born but when they were born
[35:34] let's just read it let's go to
[35:36] Genesis the
[35:41] um 25th
[35:48] chapter and start with the 20th verse
[35:51] now remember a Abraham had a son named
[35:55] Isaac and Isaac Genesis
[35:59] 2520 and Isaac was 40 years old when he
[36:03] took Rebecca to wife the daughter of
[36:06] bethu the
[36:09] Syrian of pan mamam I'm sorry it's a
[36:14] hard one to pronounce the sister to laan
[36:16] the
[36:17] Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for
[36:20] his wife because she was Barren and the
[36:22] Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca
[36:26] his wife conceived
[36:28] and the children struggled together
[36:30] within her and she said if it be so why
[36:33] am I thus and she went to inquire of the
[36:36] Lord and the Lord said unto her now
[36:39] she's inside of her womb we have these
[36:42] two
[36:44] babies would be called fetuses I guess
[36:47] if you don't believe that they're alive
[36:50] and there was some sort of
[36:53] cognitive um function going on and they
[36:56] were fighting inside of their mother's
[37:00] womb and the and the one people it says
[37:05] the two nations are and and the Lord
[37:07] said unto her two nations are in thy
[37:09] womb and two manner of people shall be
[37:11] separated from thy bowels and the one
[37:14] people shall be stronger than the other
[37:17] people and the Elder Shall Serve the
[37:20] younger keep that in your mind because
[37:24] that is going to be a theme now through
[37:26] the book of obadi
[37:28] keep that prophecy there in your mind
[37:30] that one shall be stronger and the Elder
[37:33] the the Elder Shall Serve the
[37:35] younger and when her days were when her
[37:39] days to be delivered were fulfilled
[37:40] behold there were twins in her womb and
[37:43] the first came out red and all over like
[37:46] a hairy garment and they called his name
[37:48] Esau so when Esau was born he was a
[37:51] little red hairy
[37:55] baby and after that came his brother out
[37:59] and his hand took hold of Esau's heel
[38:02] and his name was called Jacob and Isaac
[38:06] was three score years old when she bare
[38:09] them so Esau came out first he was the
[38:12] Elder Jacob was the younger and they
[38:14] battled inside the womb and the boys
[38:17] grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter and a
[38:20] man of the field and Jacob was a plain
[38:22] man dwelling in tents so these two boys
[38:26] they grew up and they were always at
[38:28] odds with each other and you'll see that
[38:30] the prophecy they started at odds in the
[38:33] womb and they they were at odds all the
[38:35] way
[38:37] for hundreds and hundreds of years after
[38:40] that their offspring so as they grew
[38:43] up the
[38:45] older Adam I'm the
[38:52] oldest so the older tradition was the
[38:57] older had the birthright which means
[39:01] that he got the the biggest share of the
[39:05] inheritance from the Father the younger
[39:09] here was
[39:11] Jacob and Jacob he saw that so there was
[39:16] one day and Jacob wanted this Birthright
[39:19] so he saw he he saw an opportunity Esau
[39:22] was out hunting he was a man's man he
[39:24] was rough he was out he he probably
[39:26] smelled like the field he did smell like
[39:28] the field he um he liked to hunt he
[39:30] liked to kill deer his dad was really
[39:33] proud of him Jacob was more you know
[39:36] he's he's more comfortable at home you
[39:38] know just a little bit of a of a of a
[39:41] softer person it seems like so he cooked
[39:44] up this nice bowl of red
[39:47] stew and Jake or Esau was tired he comes
[39:53] back
[39:54] in to the house and he's
[39:58] am and Jacob says here's some
[40:02] stew and Esau looks at it smells good
[40:07] and he's hungry and Jacob says give me
[40:10] the birth right first Esau didn't care
[40:15] about the
[40:15] birthright it wasn't important to him so
[40:19] he says sure he says you can have it
[40:21] just give me the stew I feel like I'm
[40:22] going to die so Jacob gives him the stew
[40:26] now that was just Aver conversation
[40:27] between two brothers in
[40:30] private but it shows that we should
[40:32] always be careful of everything that we
[40:34] say even the thoughts that we think
[40:37] because God was watching this
[40:39] conversation between these two
[40:43] brothers and that decision that was made
[40:47] by Esau to give that Birthright to his
[40:51] younger brother God saw and God honored
[40:55] now I believe it was God's will
[40:58] according to the prophecy given to
[40:59] Rebecca their mother that he would that
[41:02] the younger would have the birthright
[41:05] but
[41:07] still it was it was the oldest older
[41:11] ones to have so he had to give it up and
[41:15] he did and God was watching and God saw
[41:19] that Covenant that was made even though
[41:21] it was over a bowl of
[41:23] soup and later on we see that
[41:27] that um Jacob and Esau were coming their
[41:32] dad was getting old their dad Isaac was
[41:33] getting old he was blind and they wanted
[41:36] this blessing from their father that was
[41:38] a big deal so Isaac was calling his sons
[41:44] in Jacob's mom both of their
[41:49] mom preferred Jacob over Esau she
[41:53] dressed him up in in a in hairy hairy
[41:56] garment must have smelled like a goat
[41:59] and and made him smell and feel like the
[42:04] brother Esau goes
[42:07] in the father Isaac he's
[42:11] blind and Jacob is imitating his brother
[42:15] Esau and he says here I am dad will you
[42:19] give me the blessing and he says Ah you
[42:21] know you sound like
[42:24] Jacob but you smell like Esau you feel
[42:27] like
[42:28] Esau and he says no I'm Esau
[42:32] so the prophet Isaac gives his
[42:37] Blessing to the younger he was tricked
[42:41] into doing it but I always think that
[42:44] Jacob gets a bad
[42:45] rap because Esau had already given that
[42:50] Birthright to
[42:51] Jacob and God's Prophet Isaac a
[42:55] wonderful man a great great man of God
[42:58] he was just falling in the order of
[43:01] God's ordained plan even though he
[43:03] didn't know it so wasn't a mistake I
[43:05] don't think so I think it was just God
[43:08] leading Isaac to do this even though he
[43:10] didn't know what he was doing he gives
[43:12] the blessing to the younger because the
[43:14] older one didn't care the Bible says he
[43:16] despised the birthright it wasn't
[43:18] important to him so then he comes in
[43:22] after his brother leaves and he gets all
[43:24] mad and and um
[43:27] there's the it's it's just a continued
[43:30] fight between those two for pretty much
[43:33] forever so this book of
[43:36] Obadiah it is talking about the sons of
[43:42] Esau the sons of
[43:44] Edom and the lineage that Esau had so
[43:49] let's go to Obadiah and let's read the
[43:52] whole
[43:53] thing it says this OB
[43:57] verse one there's only one
[43:59] chapter the vision of
[44:01] Obadiah thus sayith the Lord God
[44:04] concerning Edom so Obadiah this prophet
[44:07] he comes and he is going to give a
[44:09] prophecy to this group of people called
[44:13] Edom we have heard a rumor from the Lord
[44:17] and an ambassador is sent among the
[44:19] Heathen arise ye and let us rise up and
[44:23] go against her in battle so the prophecy
[44:26] begins by saying that God sent a message
[44:30] which is declaring war on these
[44:34] and now he is going to speak to
[44:37] the behold I have made thee
[44:40] small among the Heathen the Heathen are
[44:42] the
[44:44] Gentiles Thou Art greatly
[44:46] despised the pride of thine heart hath
[44:49] deceived thee that thou dwell Us in the
[44:51] cleft of the in the Clift of the rock
[44:54] whose habitation is high that saith in
[44:57] his heart who shall bring me down to the
[45:00] ground now if you could put up that map
[45:03] first brother
[45:04] Jeremy let's first of all let's let's
[45:06] see where Edom is as opposed to Israel
[45:08] it's in the South you can
[45:11] see um there's
[45:13] Judah and then there's Israel on the
[45:16] left side of the Jordan River and the
[45:18] Dead Sea there and you can see Moab and
[45:20] Ammon but what we're looking at right
[45:22] now is Edom which is the yellow on the
[45:25] very south so
[45:27] this this country right here has be
[45:29] become a very powerful country and the
[45:32] scripture here God is saying through his
[45:34] Prophet he's saying the pride of your
[45:36] heart has deceived you because you dwell
[45:40] in the Cliffs of the rock whose
[45:42] habitation is high that saith in his
[45:44] heart who shall bring me down to the
[45:46] ground now if you could go to the next
[45:48] slide brother Jeremy this is
[45:52] um I forgot the name of it um the city
[45:55] of what is it brother ly the pet Petra
[45:59] this is uh this is Petra now this is
[46:01] probably what it looked like this is in
[46:04] modern day Jordan this is probably what
[46:06] it looked like it is very close to what
[46:08] it looked like when they first built
[46:09] this these are where the are
[46:11] dwelling and you can see that it's built
[46:14] into the Rock and it's built up really
[46:16] high so an invading Army has a major
[46:18] disadvantage there they can't Tear Down
[46:21] the Walls because there's no walls they
[46:23] can't tear down a mountain they don't
[46:24] have cannons they don't have a way to
[46:26] attack this so they have The High Ground
[46:28] so any attacking Army is going to be at
[46:31] a major major
[46:34] disadvantage because they can shoot
[46:35] their arrows down they can throw rocks
[46:37] down on them and it's going to be just a
[46:39] very very difficult thing for someone to
[46:41] attack and you can go to the next
[46:43] picture there and this is a modern day
[46:45] this is what the what it looks like
[46:48] today right here and uh it stood the T
[46:54] test of
[46:55] time so what the Lord is saying here
[46:59] he's saying that you think that you're
[47:02] in this impen impenetrable Fortress you
[47:05] you think that no one can get you
[47:08] because you are making your Abode up in
[47:12] these these
[47:14] Cliffs and nobody can get to
[47:17] you
[47:20] so he he is saying that you're going to
[47:24] be brought down though no matter how
[47:26] great you think that you are though thou
[47:29] exalt thyself as the eagle way up high
[47:34] and though thou set thy Nest Among the
[47:37] Stars Then will I bring thee down sayeth
[47:40] the Lord if thieves come to thee if
[47:44] robbers by
[47:46] Night how art thou cut off would they
[47:49] not have stolen till they had enough if
[47:52] the grape gatherers came to thee would
[47:54] they not have left some grape so what
[47:55] he's saying is if if a robber comes in
[47:57] your house or if someone comes in at
[48:00] night in your Vineyard and steals your
[48:03] grapes they can't steal everything
[48:05] they're going to leave some stuff there
[48:07] because they can't carry everything they
[48:09] can't get get all of your your
[48:12] possessions so you can still go through
[48:14] and glean something but he's saying here
[48:17] that no not you eat
[48:19] them you're not going to have anything
[48:22] after this is
[48:24] over I'll read that one again the though
[48:26] thou exalt thyself as the eagle and
[48:28] those they set th and thou set thy Nest
[48:31] Among the Stars Then will I bring thee
[48:33] down sayeth the Lord if thieves come
[48:35] unto thee if robbers by Night how art
[48:38] thou cut off would they have not have
[48:40] stolen till they had enough If thy grape
[48:44] gatherers came to thee would they not
[48:46] have left would they not leave some
[48:49] grapes how are the things of Esau
[48:52] searched out how are his hidden things
[48:55] sought up all the men of thy Confederacy
[48:58] have brought thee even to the border the
[49:00] men that were at peace with thee have
[49:03] deceived thee and prevailed against thee
[49:05] that they eat thy bread and have laid a
[49:08] wound under thee there is none
[49:11] understanding in him shall I not in that
[49:15] day sayeth the Lord even destroy the
[49:17] wise men out of Edom an understanding
[49:20] out of the Mount of
[49:22] Esau and thy Mighty Men oh teeman shall
[49:26] be dismayed to the end that everyone of
[49:29] the Mount of Esau may be cut off by
[49:32] Slaughter so basically he's
[49:35] saying
[49:37] that that you've done this to this to to
[49:41] these people they this let's say Babylon
[49:44] Nebuchadnezzar invades you sat there and
[49:47] you watched it come in and because
[49:49] you've done
[49:50] this you've messed with Israel you've
[49:54] messed with God
[49:58] and you can't you are going to be
[50:01] punished let's go
[50:04] to numbers let's stop there for a second
[50:07] and let's go back in time to the book of
[50:11] numbers and this is balam's prophecy I
[50:13] want to show you something about this
[50:15] battle between Esau and Jacob and that
[50:18] had has gone on for years and years
[50:21] let's go way back to numbers chap 26
[50:24] verse 16 and this is balum prophesying
[50:27] if you remember when we went through our
[50:28] Bible study in numbers balum was a man
[50:32] that was very gifted but he was a hling
[50:35] Prophet this King baac hired balum to
[50:38] prophesy against
[50:40] Israel balum who was gifted he couldn't
[50:43] do it when he was anointed by the Holy
[50:46] Spirit he prophesied for Israel now
[50:49] listen to this this is his
[50:51] prophecy he hath said which heard the
[50:54] words of God and knew
[50:56] numbers
[50:58] 26:16 he hath
[51:01] said I got the wrong one I'm
[51:06] sorry let's
[51:20] see all right it's worth it's worth the
[51:23] wait let me there you go numers 2416
[51:26] thank you
[51:27] Brothers numbers 24:16 he hath said
[51:31] which heard the words of God and knew
[51:33] the knowledge of the most high which saw
[51:36] the vision of the almighty falling into
[51:38] a trance but having his eyes open I
[51:40] shall see him but not now I Shall Behold
[51:45] Him but not nigh there shall come a star
[51:49] out of Jacob we remember who Jacob was
[51:52] they shall come a star out of Jacob and
[51:56] a scepter shall rise out of Israel and
[51:59] shall Smite the corners of Moab and
[52:01] destroy the children of of Seth so what
[52:05] is this prophecy of it's very common
[52:08] very prophecy we all know it's a
[52:11] prophecy of the coming
[52:12] Messiah verse number 18 and Edom shall
[52:16] be a possession SE also shall be a
[52:19] possession for his enemies and Israel
[52:21] shall do valiantly out of Jacob shall
[52:24] come he that ha shall have dominion and
[52:27] shall destroy him that remaineth of the
[52:30] city so we see way back A Prophecy of
[52:35] the Messiah coming and that he will D he
[52:39] will take charge of everything now let's
[52:42] go to Jeremiah this is a very very
[52:45] interesting series of scriptures so
[52:47] listen
[52:48] close Jeremiah chapter 31 verse 15
[52:59] thus sayeth the
[53:00] Lord a voice was heard in Rama
[53:04] lamentation and bitter
[53:08] weeping roel I believe that's Rachel
[53:11] weeping for her children refused to be
[53:14] conf comforted for her children because
[53:17] they were
[53:20] not a prophecy that you would have no
[53:23] idea what that is until it happens let's
[53:26] go to Matthew Chapter
[53:30] 2 now this is the Fulfillment of that
[53:35] prophecy then was fulfilled that which
[53:37] was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet
[53:39] saying in Rama there was a voice heard a
[53:43] lamentation and weeping and great
[53:45] mourning Rachel weeping for her children
[53:47] and would not be comforted because they
[53:49] are not so that was when King
[53:53] Herod came on the scene the wise men
[53:56] didn't give him the information that he
[53:58] wanted so then he goes and he starts
[54:01] killing all of the young all of the baby
[54:04] boys and then this cry comes out out of
[54:08] Israel this mourning from all the babies
[54:11] from all the mothers from all the
[54:13] families that were suffering from this
[54:16] so This Herod was doing that and
[54:18] remember way back in balum he says that
[54:20] this star would come up so we see that
[54:24] that these two things are happening now
[54:27] remember way back he said the star of
[54:29] Jacob so remember that these two
[54:32] battling factions started in the womb
[54:35] between Esau and Jacob and they were
[54:37] fighting for all of these years now I'm
[54:39] going to get to my point I wanted to lay
[54:41] this foundation so they're killing these
[54:44] babies when Jesus is here and who is
[54:47] killing the babies you remember what was
[54:49] his name
[54:51] Herod Herod was an
[54:54] Edomite he was some someone from this
[54:57] lineage of Esau and you see they're
[55:00] still battling this out but right at
[55:03] this time just after this time Edom
[55:07] ceases to
[55:10] exist when Rome came in destroyed the
[55:13] temple destroyed and killed all killed
[55:16] all the the thousands of people that
[55:18] they did that is the last of Edom right
[55:21] there
[55:23] so there's this battle that has been
[55:26] going going on for hundreds and hundreds
[55:28] of years now let's go back to Obadiah
[55:30] verse 10 for thy violence against thy
[55:34] brother Jacob shame shall cover thee
[55:37] remember what Herod
[55:40] did to the children of Israel killing
[55:43] their babies for thy violence against
[55:45] thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee
[55:47] and also them not helping out when when
[55:50] this invading Army came and thou shalt
[55:53] be cut off forever in the day that thou
[55:56] us on the other side now every almost
[56:00] every modern
[56:01] translation that it says on the day that
[56:04] thou stood us on the other side it says
[56:07] that on the day that you stood aloof
[56:11] basically you didn't do anything you saw
[56:13] all of this happening and you just stood
[56:16] should stood back you shied away you
[56:18] didn't you didn't do anything and that's
[56:20] when when we look at it brothers and
[56:22] sisters we we've said before that if you
[56:25] see something happening if you see a
[56:28] wrong being done if you see violence
[56:30] being committed if you if you see
[56:32] something and you just stand back and
[56:34] you hide your face and you don't do
[56:36] anything then you can be just as
[56:39] responsible for not doing anything as
[56:43] you would be for doing something wrong
[56:46] so not doing something is not always the
[56:49] safe way to do it we should always be
[56:52] working and serving God and doing the
[56:55] best that we can
[56:56] and this this chapter right here is very
[57:02] a very good lesson like don't stand back
[57:04] and not do
[57:05] anything be up and doing we live in this
[57:09] age now that we call the Leo Dean age
[57:14] from from Revelation chapter 3 it says
[57:17] I'm Luke just lukewarm I have need of
[57:20] nothing and it's a laziness and it's a
[57:23] it's a refusal of the people people to
[57:26] be up and doing up and and making things
[57:34] happen Psalm 1377 says this remember oh
[57:37] Lord the children of Edom in the day of
[57:40] Jerusalem who said raise it raise it
[57:43] even to the foundation thereof that mean
[57:45] that word raise it means tear it down
[57:47] English Standard Version says remember
[57:49] oh Lord against the the day of
[57:51] Jerusalem how they said Lay It Be lay it
[57:54] be down to its foundation
[57:57] so God is accusing Edom here of doing
[58:02] nothing James
[58:04] 4 CH James 4:16 says this but now
[58:09] rejoice in your boasting all such
[58:11] rejoicing is evil therefore to him that
[58:14] knoweth to do good and doeth it not to
[58:17] him it is
[58:21] sin so if you know to do good if you
[58:24] know you should be doing something if
[58:25] you know you should be making an impact
[58:28] and you don't do it it's still sin even
[58:31] though you're doing
[58:34] nothing back to Obadiah number 11 in the
[58:39] day that thou stood us on the other
[58:41] side basically you saw that your brother
[58:44] need help but you did nothing in the day
[58:46] that the strangers carried away captive
[58:48] his forces and the foreigners entered
[58:50] into his Gates and cast lot upon
[58:52] Jerusalem even thou was one of them but
[58:56] thou should us not have looked on the
[58:58] day of thy brother in the day that he
[59:01] became a stranger neither should us thou
[59:03] have rejoiced over the children of Judah
[59:06] in the day of their destruction neither
[59:08] shouldest thou have spoken proudly in
[59:11] the day of distress thou should us not
[59:13] have entered into the the Gate of thy
[59:15] people in the day of their Calamity yay
[59:18] thou should us not have overlooked their
[59:19] Affliction in the day of their Calamity
[59:21] nor have laid hands on their substance
[59:24] in the day of their Calamity so what did
[59:26] is they watched as let's say it was
[59:28] Nebuchadnezzar they watched as
[59:29] Nebuchadnezzar's armies came in all the
[59:31] people ran away from the cities they
[59:33] took the captives they and then the ones
[59:36] that ran away they went out and they got
[59:38] them and they gave them over to the
[59:40] Babylonian armies and they went and they
[59:43] inhabited some of their cities
[59:46] even and God here is saying I saw when
[59:51] you did
[59:55] that and you they took
[59:57] advantage of their
[1:00:00] brother's
[1:00:02] Misfortune really and how many times do
[1:00:05] we see that somebody may get on your
[1:00:09] nerves or or do something against you or
[1:00:11] somebody you just don't like and you see
[1:00:14] hardships or you see something come upon
[1:00:17] them that you look on those
[1:00:21] people and there's something in you that
[1:00:24] says good
[1:00:26] I'm glad they deserved it it's a wrong
[1:00:30] spirit it's the same Spirit right here
[1:00:32] that Edom had for
[1:00:34] Israel that oh this is good finally
[1:00:38] they're getting Justice all that they've
[1:00:40] been given through all these years
[1:00:41] finally they're getting their Justice
[1:00:43] and God's saying you should have helped
[1:00:49] them
[1:00:52] neither should us thou have stood in the
[1:00:54] Crossway to cut off those of his that
[1:00:57] did Escape neither should us thou have
[1:00:59] delivered up those of his that did
[1:01:02] remain in the day of
[1:01:04] distress for the day of the Lord is near
[1:01:07] upon the Heathen as thou Hast done it
[1:01:10] shall be done unto thee thy reward shall
[1:01:14] return upon thy own head do you remember
[1:01:16] when we went through the Book of Joel
[1:01:19] the recurring theme was the day of the
[1:01:21] Lord the day of the Lord is great for
[1:01:25] some and the day of the Lord is terrible
[1:01:29] for others it depends on where you stand
[1:01:32] with the Lord when the day of the Lord
[1:01:34] comes is it going to be a great day for
[1:01:36] you or is it going to be a terrible day
[1:01:40] but the day of the Lord is coming for
[1:01:41] all of
[1:01:45] us for as ye have drunk upon my Holy
[1:01:48] Mountain so shall all the Heathen drink
[1:01:51] continually yay they shall drink and
[1:01:53] they shall swallow down and they shall
[1:01:55] be as though they had not been but upon
[1:01:58] Mount Zion shall be deliverance and
[1:02:00] there shall be Holiness and the house of
[1:02:02] Jacob shall possess their possessions
[1:02:05] House of Jacob is Israel possessing that
[1:02:08] of
[1:02:13] Edom and the house of Jacob shall be a
[1:02:15] fire and the house of Joseph a flame a
[1:02:18] flame and a fire these flame and this
[1:02:20] fly are are executing God's judgment and
[1:02:24] the house of Esau for
[1:02:27] stubble and they shall Kindle in them
[1:02:29] and devour them and there shall not be
[1:02:32] any remaining of the House of Esau for
[1:02:35] the Lord hath spoken
[1:02:37] it and they shall and and they of the
[1:02:41] South shall possess the Mount of Esau
[1:02:43] and they of the plain the Philistines
[1:02:45] and they shall possess the fields of
[1:02:47] Ephraim and the fields of Samaria and
[1:02:49] Benjamin shall possess Gilead and the
[1:02:52] Captivity of this host of the children
[1:02:55] of Israel shall
[1:02:56] possess that of the Canaanites even unto
[1:02:59] zerath and the Captivity of Jerusalem
[1:03:02] which is that at Shephard shall possess
[1:03:06] the cities of the
[1:03:07] South and the Captivity as they said the
[1:03:10] Captivity of this host of the children
[1:03:12] of Israel shall possess all of the
[1:03:16] Canaanites place now that hasn't
[1:03:19] completely happened yet Israel is back
[1:03:23] in their Homeland but I mean Solomon
[1:03:26] probably had the biggest kingdom that
[1:03:28] Israel has ever had but it still has not
[1:03:31] fulfilled this there is still land that
[1:03:34] is was given to Israel that they do not
[1:03:37] have yet and it says right here and all
[1:03:41] of this land was given to
[1:03:44] them and savior shall come upon Mount
[1:03:47] Zion to judge the Mount of Esau and the
[1:03:49] kingdom shall be the Lords for thy
[1:03:52] violence against thy brother Jacob shall
[1:03:55] come
[1:03:56] shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut
[1:04:00] off
[1:04:02] forever so most of the prophecy of this
[1:04:05] book has been fulfilled but there's
[1:04:08] still some that hasn't as far as the
[1:04:11] land and in
[1:04:13] closing in this book of
[1:04:17] Obadiah the first part is a judgment
[1:04:20] upon Edom for what they did and then the
[1:04:23] second part is warning all the people
[1:04:25] basically don't mess with
[1:04:28] Israel don't mess with my
[1:04:31] people because if you do then God's
[1:04:34] judgments will come down upon you and
[1:04:37] look at what's going on right now I mean
[1:04:40] this is this is a perfect example we see
[1:04:43] it on the news where these
[1:04:47] Hamas and Hezbollah they're coming in
[1:04:51] they're shooting Rockets over the border
[1:04:52] and they're trying to attack these
[1:04:54] people of Israel and when they do that
[1:04:56] they are fighting against God and let me
[1:04:58] tell you something when you fight
[1:04:59] against God you will
[1:05:01] lose and look what's happening they're
[1:05:04] taking people out with pagers and
[1:05:07] walkie-talkies and Rockets and bullets
[1:05:10] and the things that are happening it's
[1:05:11] every single one every time they someone
[1:05:14] else gets promoted he's gone another one
[1:05:17] gets promoted he's gone these these
[1:05:19] things that we're seeing over in the
[1:05:21] Middle East right now are I don't know
[1:05:23] how they could even be possible
[1:05:25] with the way that they're doing it one
[1:05:28] by one they're taking out these
[1:05:31] leaders and it shows here God is still
[1:05:34] fighting God's word is still true this
[1:05:37] word in Obadiah even though this this
[1:05:40] these have been wiped
[1:05:42] out there are still people coming
[1:05:44] against Israel and they're still
[1:05:46] forsaking Israel and they're still
[1:05:49] fighting against Israel and it seems
[1:05:51] like we would learn by reading this book
[1:05:54] don't do that
[1:05:57] because then you'll find yourself
[1:05:58] fighting against God and that is a
[1:06:00] losing
[1:06:01] proposition and we're seeing it now and
[1:06:04] pretty soon these prophecies will be
[1:06:08] fulfilled
[1:06:10] Israel will be in control peace will
[1:06:15] eventually
[1:06:17] come but until then it's just amazing to
[1:06:23] watch and we should always be friends
[1:06:26] with that
[1:06:27] country it's the Bible says it's the
[1:06:30] apple of God's
[1:06:31] eye and this book of Obadiah
[1:06:35] shows that it was another invading
[1:06:39] Army that came
[1:06:41] in and just because they stood back and
[1:06:46] allowed this Army to come in and Destroy
[1:06:49] these people they were punished and they
[1:06:52] were wiped off the map the lineage was
[1:06:55] was compl completely destroyed if they
[1:06:58] would have gone in and fought against
[1:07:02] Nebuchadnezzar let's say it was
[1:07:03] Nebuchadnezzar they would have probably
[1:07:06] lost but they would have been blessed
[1:07:10] and the lineage after them would have
[1:07:13] been blessed and they would have never
[1:07:14] been guilty of fighting against God's
[1:07:18] people but they were and then we see
[1:07:22] some of the worst people come from this
[1:07:24] line of Edom
[1:07:26] which is Herod himself and how we see we
[1:07:30] see Israel
[1:07:32] there and living their lives and we see
[1:07:36] the Fighting by Herod killing the babies
[1:07:39] and doing what he did and it it just
[1:07:42] continued it started in the womb and it
[1:07:44] continued all the way until that time
[1:07:47] and that's the book of Obadiah it's a
[1:07:49] short book very interesting book and uh
[1:07:53] and one that now you can say what it
[1:07:55] means means Daniel and and and the
[1:07:57] musicians
[1:07:59] Kum it's um I
[1:08:03] thoroughly
[1:08:05] enjoyed as I always do in every in every
[1:08:08] book thoroughly enjoyed all that um was
[1:08:13] part of of reading about this this book
[1:08:17] of Obadiah it's it's situated perfectly
[1:08:19] with Amos and Joel very similar in its
[1:08:22] Spirit we don't know when Obadiah
[1:08:25] uh was was actually given the prophecy
[1:08:28] was given it doesn't give us a date it
[1:08:30] doesn't give a king for a reference but
[1:08:34] it can say it was probably right after
[1:08:37] the invasion of Babylon into Israel when
[1:08:41] they took the captive into Judah when
[1:08:43] they took the
[1:08:44] captives Daniel
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:56] and he answered
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:08:59] me and delivered
[1:09:04] me from every
[1:09:09] fear and those look on
[1:09:14] him are
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:18] ready they'll never be
[1:09:23] ashamed they'll never be be
[1:09:28] ashamed oh
[1:09:32] magnify the
[1:09:34] Lord with
[1:09:38] me and come
[1:09:41] exalt his
[1:09:44] name
[1:09:47] together oh
[1:09:50] glorify the
[1:09:52] Lord with me
[1:09:57] and come
[1:09:59] exalt his
[1:10:01] name
[1:10:07] forever
[1:10:13] this we uh we're not in
[1:10:17] sync tonight God bless you brothers and
[1:10:20] sisters I appreciate our Bible study
[1:10:22] it's good to have everyone come together
[1:10:23] it's good to learn about these books
[1:10:25] books and you know I've been been
[1:10:28] praying this
[1:10:30] week
[1:10:32] about the
[1:10:34] future and the direction of our
[1:10:38] church
[1:10:39] and as I always do and I always
[1:10:42] have and I really don't think that we
[1:10:46] can do anything
[1:10:48] better than to learn this
[1:10:51] book we call ourselves Christians
[1:10:56] how can we call ourselves Christians if
[1:10:57] we don't know this
[1:10:59] book how can we call ourselves
[1:11:01] Christians if we don't know what Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ was sent for what he died for and
[1:11:07] what he
[1:11:09] said we
[1:11:11] can't and I believe it's very very
[1:11:14] important that our church that we come
[1:11:16] together on these Wednesday nights we
[1:11:18] learn about this Bible and then on
[1:11:21] Sundays we we dig deeper into the
[1:11:24] scriptures and and bring out how this
[1:11:26] can be applied to our lives but I don't
[1:11:29] think there's anything better that we
[1:11:30] can do than to study the Bible so let's
[1:11:34] continue study it on your own read it on
[1:11:36] your own and stand strong on what it
[1:11:40] says and let the Holy Spirit interpret
[1:11:43] it to you and give your life brothers
[1:11:46] and
[1:11:47] sisters to the
[1:11:49] Lord and Lead others and don't do like
[1:11:53] these did where you just stand
[1:11:56] back and we watch as people be destroyed
[1:12:01] as hope uh brother Matt's still here he
[1:12:05] just is he still back
[1:12:08] there pray for one
[1:12:10] another no matter what situation that
[1:12:13] someone else is in enter into their
[1:12:16] suffering with them and pray for them be
[1:12:19] a
[1:12:22] friend be a brother
[1:12:25] not like Esau and Jacob were but be a
[1:12:30] brother like the
[1:12:32] Lord is to us and how much he loves us
[1:12:36] and he's always there for us we need to
[1:12:38] be like that for each other this book of
[1:12:40] Obadiah expressly
[1:12:43] condemns being
[1:12:45] aloof and not standing for each
[1:12:49] other so always do it brother and
[1:12:52] sisters always stand for your your your
[1:12:54] family your friends friends and those
[1:12:56] that are in need and I promise
[1:12:59] you that the Lord will bless you for it
[1:13:01] remember our lord Jesus said when the
[1:13:04] two came before him one thought he was
[1:13:06] going to heaven and he was going to hell
[1:13:08] the other
[1:13:09] one Jesus gave
[1:13:11] him compliments and and said enter into
[1:13:14] the kingdom and he said when I was in
[1:13:18] prison you visited
[1:13:19] me when I was in need you helped
[1:13:24] me when I when there there was many
[1:13:27] things and and and the man said when
[1:13:30] were you in prison and I helped you when
[1:13:33] were you hungry and I gave you food when
[1:13:36] did I do these things and he says in so
[1:13:38] much as you've done it unto these the
[1:13:40] least of these you did it to
[1:13:42] me and I believe that that is the big
[1:13:45] lesson Out of This Book of
[1:13:47] Obadiah is never stand
[1:13:51] back and let
[1:13:53] something let let someone be
[1:13:57] hurt and then never take advantage of
[1:14:00] someone's
[1:14:01] Misfortune amen let's all stand brother
[1:14:05] Daniel I'm going to pull on you to have
[1:14:07] you come and close in prayer if you
[1:14:08] would my

[1:14:25] and the Lord heard
[1:14:29] me and save me
[1:14:34] from my
[1:14:39] enemies the Son of
[1:14:43] God surrounds his
[1:14:47] sa he will deliver
[1:14:52] them he will deliver
[1:14:59] [Music]

[1:15:04] Living

[1:15:23] our focus on you and whatever trials and
[1:15:27] challenges we face um this week and
