[59:19] that where i am that's just where i want
[59:21] to be lord i want to be where you are
[59:24] and he says and whither i go you know in
[59:26] the way you know
[59:28] thomas said unto him lord we know not
[59:30] whether thou go and how can we know the
[59:32] way
[59:32] jesus said unto him i am the way
[59:36] let me add to that i am the way and i am
[59:39] the truth and
[59:40] i am the life no man cometh unto the
[59:43] father but by
[59:45] me first corinthians one more scripture
[59:47] we'll have you be seated
[59:49] first corinthians chapter 15 amen
[1:00:03] brothers i sent a powerpoint also a pdf
[1:00:06] you could have that powerpoint ready
[1:00:08] first that'd just be fine
[1:00:10] uh let's just begin reading there's a
[1:00:12] lot i want to catch from this but
[1:00:14] let's just begin reading in verse 14.
[1:00:18] verse 13. let's back up to that no
[1:00:21] let's go to verse 12. now if christ be
[1:00:25] preached that he rose from the dead how
[1:00:27] say some among you
[1:00:30] that there is no resurrection of the
[1:00:32] dead
[1:00:34] but if there be no resurrection of the
[1:00:36] dead
[1:00:37] then is christ not risen
[1:00:41] you see how important resurrection is
[1:00:44] let's read it again in verse 13 but if
[1:00:46] there be no resurrection
[1:00:48] of the dead then is christ
[1:00:51] not risen and let's make it worse
[1:00:54] if christ is not risen then are
[1:00:57] preaching
[1:00:58] vain in other words we're wasting our
[1:01:02] time
[1:01:03] and your faith also vain
[1:01:08] yea and we are found false witnesses of
[1:01:11] god
[1:01:12] because we have testified of god that he
[1:01:14] raised up christ
[1:01:16] whom he raised not up if so be that
[1:01:19] the dead rise not for if the dead
[1:01:23] rise not then is not christ raised
[1:01:27] and if christ be not raised your faith
[1:01:29] is vain
[1:01:30] ye are yet in your sins
[1:01:34] thank god he's raised
[1:01:38] i said thank god he's raised
[1:01:42] then let's keep going verse 18. then
[1:01:44] they also which are fallen asleep
[1:01:46] those who have passed in christ are
[1:01:49] perished
[1:01:50] and then here's this famous verse here i
[1:01:52] love so much
[1:01:54] i love it because i identify so much
[1:01:56] with it
[1:01:57] if in this life only
[1:02:00] we have hope in christ we are
[1:02:03] of all men most
[1:02:06] miserable now i want you to catch what
[1:02:08] paul is saying here he's saying that if
[1:02:10] in this life we have hope in christ it's
[1:02:13] good i'm glad i have hope in christ
[1:02:15] and i'm glad in this life i have hope
[1:02:17] with christ but paul says if it's
[1:02:20] only hope in this life then i am of
[1:02:23] all men most miserable because
[1:02:26] my hope of christ in this life points to
[1:02:29] a hope in the next life
[1:02:32] but now is christ risen from the dead
[1:02:34] and become the firstfruits of them that
[1:02:37] slept
[1:02:38] for since by man came death by man also
[1:02:41] the resurrection of the dead by man also
[1:02:43] came the resurrection of the dead
[1:02:45] for as an adam all die even so in christ
[1:02:47] shall all be made
[1:02:48] alive but every man in his own order
[1:02:51] christ the firstfruits afterward they
[1:02:54] that are christ
[1:02:55] at his coming then cometh the end
[1:02:58] when he shall have delivered up the
[1:03:00] kingdom to god even the father
[1:03:02] when he shall have put down all rule and
[1:03:05] all authority and power for he must
[1:03:08] reign till he hath put
[1:03:09] all enemies under his feet
[1:03:13] and some of those enemies will be christ
[1:03:16] and you
[1:03:17] putting under your feet the last enemy
[1:03:20] that shall be destroyed
[1:03:21] is death let's just move on down here
[1:03:24] just for a minute
[1:03:26] let me just uh maybe maybe we'll just
[1:03:28] pray let's do that since i've had you
[1:03:29] standing
[1:03:30] for so long then i'll we'll read it one
[1:03:32] more seated in verse 51
[1:03:34] lord jesus we thank you lord for your
[1:03:36] word lord we just
[1:03:38] feel so unworthy
[1:03:42] lord as we stand here today we feel so
[1:03:45] lord unworthy of the grace that you've
[1:03:47] bestowed upon us
[1:03:49] how we can read these words lord and
[1:03:52] it's not like reading a novel it's not
[1:03:54] reading the newspaper it's not reading
[1:03:56] just the local
[1:03:58] events of what transpired in the
[1:04:00] sporting event or what transpired last
[1:04:02] week in the white house
[1:04:04] lord but when we read these words they
[1:04:06] mean so much to us
[1:04:07] lord they're our life story we're
[1:04:10] they're interwoven as part of us
[1:04:13] lord and we stand here today unworthy of
[1:04:15] that kind of grace
[1:04:16] but with hands raised we say thank you
[1:04:18] lord jesus
[1:04:20] that your mercy has been bestowed upon
[1:04:22] us that we can
[1:04:23] believe that we have the ability to
[1:04:25] believe your word
[1:04:27] in a world that's unbelieving in a world
[1:04:29] that's
[1:04:30] lord turn their back on you lord yet
[1:04:33] father you've placed something in our
[1:04:35] heart lord where you mean everything to
[1:04:37] us
[1:04:38] lord what manner of love is this that
[1:04:40] you've bestowed upon us
[1:04:41] we thank you for it may god you come
[1:04:43] with your
[1:04:44] spirit lord now i pray god that you
[1:04:47] would come and speak your word to your
[1:04:49] children
[1:04:50] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[1:04:53] you can be seated
[1:04:54] just move down there in your bible to
[1:04:56] verse 51 and we'll just keep reading
[1:04:57] there
[1:04:58] and then i'll have you turn also to one
[1:05:00] more we're using
[1:05:01] again here on our sunday nights teaching
[1:05:05] i believe it's as we've said many times
[1:05:07] it's extremely important
[1:05:09] amen is is teaching it's one thing to
[1:05:11] believe
[1:05:12] false doctrine but it's almost just as
[1:05:14] bad to believe
[1:05:15] no doctrine and so we know what we know
[1:05:18] that that the lord has given us
[1:05:20] something to believe
[1:05:22] and we're grateful for that but we want
[1:05:23] to know what to believe
[1:05:25] and so i believe that teaching is
[1:05:27] important so just bear with me here
[1:05:29] tonight
[1:05:30] amen as i just deliver what the lord
[1:05:32] told me to minister here tonight
[1:05:35] behold verse 51 behold i show you a
[1:05:39] mystery
[1:05:40] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:05:43] be
[1:05:43] changed in a moment in a moment
[1:05:47] just like that in the twinkling of an
[1:05:50] eye at the last trump that twinkling of
[1:05:54] an eye
[1:05:55] is uh there's no exact that i can find
[1:05:58] specific uh correlation that we could
[1:06:01] give a
[1:06:02] modern-day term to correlate that but as
[1:06:05] if
[1:06:05] as i've studied it it's like the light
[1:06:08] uh coming into the iris when uh when a
[1:06:11] light strikes your eye and there's a
[1:06:13] just a moment
[1:06:14] of a sparkle that hits the iris and paul
[1:06:17] is just using an example
[1:06:19] here's here's what he's trying to say
[1:06:21] it's going to happen
[1:06:22] and it's going to happen very fast
[1:06:26] it's going to happen very quick in a
[1:06:28] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:06:31] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:06:33] sound
[1:06:34] and the dead shall be raised
[1:06:37] incorruptible incorruptible
[1:06:41] the dead shall be raised without
[1:06:45] need for any prophet or any ministry or
[1:06:48] any man to perfect their body
[1:06:52] hello the dead will be
[1:06:55] raised already incorruptible
[1:06:59] why we don't need a the brother branham
[1:07:02] to come back and
[1:07:03] as people have labeled him too to come
[1:07:04] back and to do some work
[1:07:06] he finished his work now it's our work
[1:07:08] now it's what are we going to do are we
[1:07:10] going to finish our race
[1:07:12] that they there's a ministry coming and
[1:07:14] brother bannon will all receive our body
[1:07:16] change well then tell me how
[1:07:17] are they in need of a body when the
[1:07:19] bible says they raise out of the ground
[1:07:22] incorruptible already
[1:07:25] and so he says the dead shall be raised
[1:07:28] incorruptible and we shall be
[1:07:32] changed i need to change i got so much
[1:07:36] about me that needs to change and i'm
[1:07:37] changing day by day
[1:07:39] glory unto glory he's changing me he's
[1:07:42] changing me
[1:07:43] but the last change is not a change that
[1:07:46] takes place in your mind
[1:07:48] or in your spirit it takes place at the
[1:07:51] at the uh the the molecular level
[1:07:56] when your body's changed and this mortal
[1:07:59] shall put on immortality in this
[1:08:01] corruptable
[1:08:02] shall put on incorruption i'm looking
[1:08:04] forward to that day
[1:08:06] he says that in verse 53 for this
[1:08:08] corruptible
[1:08:09] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[1:08:12] must put on immortality so when this
[1:08:16] corruptable shall have put on
[1:08:17] incorruption and this mortal
[1:08:19] shall have put on immortality then shall
[1:08:21] be brought to pass
[1:08:22] the saying that is written death is
[1:08:24] swallowed up
[1:08:25] and victory o death where is your sting
[1:08:28] o grave where is your victory and so we
[1:08:32] know here in first thessalonians we're
[1:08:33] just going to go through these just for
[1:08:35] a moment i want you just to follow along
[1:08:36] with me
[1:08:37] if you have a bible i'd be good if you
[1:08:40] use it first thessalonians chapter 4 if
[1:08:42] not they have it on the screen for us
[1:08:44] first thessalonians 4 furthermore we
[1:08:48] beseech you
[1:08:49] brethren and exhort you by the lord
[1:08:52] jesus
[1:08:53] that as you have received of us how you
[1:08:56] ought to walk and to please god so that
[1:08:58] you would abound
[1:08:59] more and more now i know this scripture
[1:09:02] has been
[1:09:03] all of these the ones we read in
[1:09:04] corinthians and the one in thessalonians
[1:09:07] make things so clear for us in in as far
[1:09:10] as what we have set our expectation
[1:09:13] to it's amazing sadly how that some have
[1:09:16] even believed
[1:09:17] and some have suggested that that the
[1:09:20] body chan
[1:09:21] that the resurrection is already passed
[1:09:23] it's amazing you find that spirit even
[1:09:25] in the day when paul wrote this and
[1:09:27] there are some
[1:09:28] even today uh who would who would try to
[1:09:31] to to promote a false doctrine that the
[1:09:34] resurrection's already taken place and
[1:09:36] we must have misted him
[1:09:37] there are some even who suggested to me
[1:09:39] that we're currently right now
[1:09:42] in the great tribulation and that covet
[1:09:44] 19 is the great tribulation and this is
[1:09:47] germ warfare that brother branham spoke
[1:09:49] of you got to be so careful
[1:09:52] how we so many times let me just back up
[1:09:55] here just for a moment
[1:09:56] to make sure i don't gloss over this you
[1:09:58] have to be so careful in your
[1:10:00] understanding
[1:10:01] because your understanding of of of
[1:10:04] truth will then determine your
[1:10:07] expectation
[1:10:09] and how you live in other words if
[1:10:12] you're
[1:10:13] if you're if you're living like the lord
[1:10:15] is coming tomorrow
[1:10:16] then the bible says you purify yourself
[1:10:21] but when you don't live like he's coming
[1:10:22] tomorrow then you don't purify yourself
[1:10:25] you don't live a sanctified life
[1:10:27] if that day's already passed if we're
[1:10:28] not an expectation
[1:10:30] that it could happen in the morning so
[1:10:32] it's important what we believe
[1:10:34] it's important what is taught and that
[1:10:37] it's based upon
[1:10:38] the word because brother branham was a
[1:10:41] bible prophet
[1:10:42] in other words he was a bible-based
[1:10:45] prophet he didn't come
[1:10:46] with a new doctrine or a new theory or
[1:10:49] some new doctrine
[1:10:50] the message of the hour is not a
[1:10:52] conglomeration of doctrines given to
[1:10:54] william branham
[1:10:57] but the message rightly seen
[1:11:00] was a message that was a restoration
[1:11:04] of the apostle paul's message
[1:11:08] i couldn't say it more simply than that
[1:11:11] the message did not come to take us
[1:11:14] beyond paul that's false doctrine
[1:11:17] how could you go beyond paul's ministry
[1:11:19] how could you go
[1:11:20] beyond be how could you go beyond the
[1:11:22] abstract
[1:11:23] how could you go beyond the the alpha
[1:11:25] church it was a restoration
[1:11:28] back to the truth because the truth is
[1:11:31] not
[1:11:32] a doctrine the truth is not a story the
[1:11:35] truth is
[1:11:36] the truth is not a denomination the
[1:11:38] truth is not
[1:11:39] brother branham the truth is not just
[1:11:41] the bible or the message the truth
[1:11:43] is a person
[1:11:46] and he's revealed in his own word
[1:11:52] it's important that we clarify that he's
[1:11:53] revealed in his own word he's the person
[1:11:55] of the word
[1:11:58] is he jesus of nazareth yes he was is he
[1:12:01] jesus who we heard about in sunday
[1:12:03] school
[1:12:03] yes he was but who is jesus today he's
[1:12:07] jesus revealed in his
[1:12:08] own word and so that's why brother
[1:12:12] branham says they've crucified the word
[1:12:14] of god afresh they've crucified christ
[1:12:16] not that
[1:12:17] jesus came back and was born in a virgin
[1:12:19] again and then he was crucified
[1:12:22] but he had became the word and they
[1:12:25] rejected the word they crucified when he
[1:12:27] preaches
[1:12:27] indictment he's indicted a generation
[1:12:30] for the second crucifixion
[1:12:32] of the word
[1:12:36] so it's important how we it's important
[1:12:38] what we
[1:12:39] say let me come back to my thought here
[1:12:41] for a moment it's so important
[1:12:43] that we that we're that we are have a
[1:12:46] proper understanding that because
[1:12:48] there's so many things
[1:12:49] that you'll find and i'm speaking from
[1:12:53] experience here
[1:12:54] there's so many things that you'll find
[1:12:56] that maybe you've heard
[1:12:58] and you say didn't brother you ever said
[1:13:00] this before didn't brother branham say
[1:13:01] something about this over here you ever
[1:13:03] said that oh yeah
[1:13:05] i know brother branham didn't he say i
[1:13:06] can't really exactly find where he
[1:13:08] mentions this exactly and
[1:13:09] and you know what's amazing i was
[1:13:11] looking for something the other day and
[1:13:12] i was trying to find something that i
[1:13:14] just knew brother branham said
[1:13:18] and i go back and i'm having trouble
[1:13:19] searching it finding it searching it and
[1:13:21] i'll call another minister another
[1:13:22] brother a few other
[1:13:23] brothers i know i've heard yeah brother
[1:13:25] man i've heard that too and finally when
[1:13:27] i got down to the bottom of what he
[1:13:29] actually said it was so different it was
[1:13:31] close
[1:13:34] but it was preached through maybe a
[1:13:36] brother a preacher a
[1:13:37] person who said it at a table drinking
[1:13:39] coffee and then somehow we get that oh
[1:13:41] brother branham said that when he never
[1:13:43] really said it
[1:13:44] and if he didn't say if he did say it he
[1:13:46] didn't say it the way maybe that we've
[1:13:48] twisted it to say
[1:13:51] and so there's so many things even even
[1:13:53] let me just stop here for a moment
[1:13:55] you know with with with germ warfare
[1:13:58] you know and we we have the quote where
[1:14:00] brother adam talks about this in german
[1:14:02] warfare
[1:14:04] what you'll realize when you go back and
[1:14:05] you read the context of what brother
[1:14:07] branham is talking about
[1:14:08] german warfare that he's talking about
[1:14:10] happens in the tribulation period
[1:14:15] then what is covet brother matt it's a
[1:14:17] germ
[1:14:19] yeah so is the flu
[1:14:22] so was the bird flu
[1:14:26] so was the dog flu or the cat flu or
[1:14:29] whatever other foods they've had
[1:14:32] the other strains that they've had of
[1:14:33] the flu it's all germs it's part of the
[1:14:36] curse
[1:14:37] that happens in the garden of eden but
[1:14:39] it's not the plagues
[1:14:42] of the tribulation and when you believe
[1:14:45] that and you get an expectation
[1:14:47] you can almost create listen listen you
[1:14:49] can make the message say whatever you
[1:14:51] want it to say
[1:14:52] you take snip a little quote here and
[1:14:54] snip a little quote there
[1:14:56] you know jesus said to those on the road
[1:14:57] to emmaus he says you
[1:14:59] fools you fools and slow of heart to
[1:15:01] believe all the prophets have spoken
[1:15:03] you remember that now watch how i can
[1:15:06] just change the words of that
[1:15:08] you fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:15:10] all
[1:15:11] that the prophet spoke
[1:15:14] you believed it all you see just a
[1:15:17] little inflection and you changed the
[1:15:19] whole meaning
[1:15:20] or i could say you fools and slow of
[1:15:22] heart to believe all the prophets have
[1:15:23] spoken
[1:15:25] it's different two different meanings so
[1:15:28] you've got to be careful
[1:15:29] that we make sure we bring it back so
[1:15:32] many times we've been so
[1:15:33] guilty in the message of just saying
[1:15:35] brother branham said brother branham
[1:15:36] said and we never
[1:15:38] take it back and tie it into where he
[1:15:40] got it from the bible
[1:15:43] and we don't have a biblical
[1:15:44] understanding of the doctrine and so
[1:15:46] therefore
[1:15:47] we can hybrid it if we're not careful
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:56] and so even even i had a brother even
[1:15:58] just just a good brother godly
[1:16:00] sincere this brother was just wonderful
[1:16:03] didn't mean anything by at all and he
[1:16:05] starts telling me yesterday
[1:16:06] you know he starts looking at some of
[1:16:08] the things a restaurant that he got
[1:16:09] shown during cove and he said you know
[1:16:11] i'm realizing now all these things
[1:16:12] brother branham said he talks about how
[1:16:13] the shutter
[1:16:14] you couldn't buy or sell you know and
[1:16:16] and how that it's taken on what you know
[1:16:18] taking away
[1:16:19] you know the and it was again like i
[1:16:21] said it wasn't in
[1:16:22] any way you you you hear so much of this
[1:16:25] so many times
[1:16:27] that that sometimes even you yourself go
[1:16:29] yeah i think so i think i've
[1:16:31] i think i've heard that before and i
[1:16:33] think brother branham said that over
[1:16:34] here and maybe it was said in a certain
[1:16:36] way
[1:16:37] you know and as we said you've heard it
[1:16:38] over here in a certain way and
[1:16:40] and and then then we can just we can go
[1:16:42] so far as we said we can make it say
[1:16:44] whatever we want to say
[1:16:47] if we don't go back ourself if we don't
[1:16:50] go back ourself
[1:16:52] and study it out for ourselves we can
[1:16:54] come up with so much
[1:16:55] it's amazing because the brother was
[1:16:57] beginning to say he said now this
[1:16:59] is you know i can see it right here
[1:17:01] they're even limited they'll be able to
[1:17:02] buy or sell and
[1:17:03] and you know brother adam talked about
[1:17:04] that i'm thinking and i stopped i said
[1:17:06] wait a minute hold on just pause for one
[1:17:08] moment
[1:17:10] that's revelations chapter 13 where it
[1:17:13] talks about he that had the power
[1:17:15] you know they took the mark in the
[1:17:16] forehead a spiritual mark
[1:17:18] and he had the power to to to cease from
[1:17:21] you know the the scripture speaks about
[1:17:22] i think he even had it written down
[1:17:24] he had he had power to give life to the
[1:17:26] image of the beast that is
[1:17:28] tribulation that's not pre-tribulation
[1:17:30] that happens in the tribulation
[1:17:34] and just so carefully so quickly we can
[1:17:36] try so hard to apply certain things that
[1:17:38] are even happening in our world today
[1:17:40] and we misapply them and brother branham
[1:17:43] says when you disjoint the word of god
[1:17:46] you've done a terrible disservice to the
[1:17:47] word
[1:17:48] when you disjoin it
[1:17:52] i'm so glad we had a prophet who was
[1:17:54] vindicated
[1:17:55] and we could go back to what he said
[1:17:59] can you say amen tonight i'm just being
[1:18:01] careful with where i go so to make sure
[1:18:03] we don't
[1:18:04] we don't lose our train of thought here
[1:18:05] but i want to make sure we cover all of
[1:18:07] this
[1:18:08] he says here for the lord himself shall
[1:18:10] descend from heaven notice this here in
[1:18:12] verse 14 again
[1:18:13] or verse 16.
[1:18:16] for the lord himself
[1:18:21] no we didn't read that sorry brother
[1:18:23] let's go back to verse 13.
[1:18:25] first thessalonians 4 13. he says but i
[1:18:28] would not have you to be ignorant
[1:18:30] brethren concerning them which are
[1:18:31] asleep
[1:18:32] that you sorrow not even as others which
[1:18:35] have
[1:18:35] no hope for if we believe that jesus
[1:18:39] died and rose again i believe that do
[1:18:42] you believe that
[1:18:43] even sow them also which sleep in jesus
[1:18:46] will god bring with him
[1:18:48] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:18:51] the lord
[1:18:52] notice that this is by revelation this
[1:18:54] is for a word from the lord for this we
[1:18:56] say unto you
[1:18:58] by the word of the lord that we which
[1:19:01] are alive
[1:19:02] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[1:19:06] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:19:09] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:19:12] heaven with a shout
[1:19:14] with the voice of the archangel and with
[1:19:16] the trump of god
[1:19:18] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:19:23] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:19:26] be
[1:19:26] called up together with them in the
[1:19:28] clouds to meet the lord in the
[1:19:30] air and so shall we ever be
[1:19:34] with the lord we which are alive
[1:19:37] and remain shall be caught up
[1:19:41] now we know that the coming of the lord
[1:19:42] here that he's speaking of when he says
[1:19:44] the lord himself shall descend
[1:19:46] brother brandon picks this up and he
[1:19:48] says in the seals he says
[1:19:49] now christ did all three
[1:19:53] in his dissension so he says
[1:19:57] christ did all three in his dissension
[1:19:59] when he descended the shout
[1:20:01] the voice the trump what was the shout
[1:20:04] it was the message of the hour
[1:20:07] it was come out of her my people and be
[1:20:09] you not partakers of her sins
[1:20:12] so that you receive not her plagues that
[1:20:14] was the message
[1:20:16] of this of the generation that you're
[1:20:18] living in come
[1:20:19] out of her and a shout went forth who
[1:20:21] was shouting brother branham
[1:20:23] no it was christ doing all three
[1:20:26] he does the shout he does the voice and
[1:20:28] he's the trump
[1:20:32] so brother branham says he now notice
[1:20:35] this
[1:20:36] it's not you you you know i want to say
[1:20:39] this just here for a moment
[1:20:40] the message of the hour is not brother
[1:20:43] branham's message
[1:20:44] it's not
[1:20:47] it's not the message of william branham
[1:20:50] no more than amos's message and amos 4
[1:20:53] was amos's message
[1:20:56] amos was just a mailman
[1:21:01] amos received the word of the lord and
[1:21:03] god
[1:21:04] gave him his message you know go read
[1:21:06] the words of jeremiah
[1:21:07] it's not the words of jeremiah to israel
[1:21:10] it's not the word
[1:21:11] or the message of jeremiah's heart but
[1:21:14] god takes jeremiah a vessel of god and
[1:21:18] god has something to say
[1:21:20] to israel so he takes a vessel
[1:21:23] and he baptizes him with his thoughts
[1:21:25] his words and his feelings
[1:21:28] and then jeremiah becomes the mouthpiece
[1:21:31] or the messenger
[1:21:32] of that message from god
[1:21:36] it wasn't amos's message it wasn't
[1:21:38] jeremiah's message
[1:21:40] it wasn't william branham's message
[1:21:42] that's why brother madam says i was just
[1:21:43] standing there when he appeared
[1:21:49] but let me stop and say this but
[1:21:52] because it was god's message then to get
[1:21:56] mad at jeremiah you're just getting mad
[1:21:58] at the mailman
[1:22:00] he's just delivering the message you
[1:22:03] might get mad at me the preacher but i'm
[1:22:04] just the mailman
[1:22:08] i'm just delivering the message don't
[1:22:10] get mad at me take it up with god
[1:22:14] but to reject amos because
[1:22:17] amos had the word from god then to
[1:22:20] reject amos you weren't rejecting amos
[1:22:23] you were rejecting god
[1:22:26] to reject jeremiah you weren't rejecting
[1:22:29] jeremiah
[1:22:30] you were rejecting jehovah and that's
[1:22:33] why when people turn away from the
[1:22:35] message they're not turning away from a
[1:22:36] kentucky man from kentucky
[1:22:39] they are turning away from jesus christ
[1:22:42] and it's not that brother branham was
[1:22:44] jesus christ and that's not what i'm
[1:22:45] saying
[1:22:46] you got to be careful because people so
[1:22:48] misconstrue things well we worship the
[1:22:50] god that's in william i don't worship
[1:22:51] the god that sent that was in william
[1:22:53] bran and i worship god
[1:22:55] worship god we're just worshiping the
[1:22:57] god that's in the man well what does
[1:22:58] that mean
[1:22:59] what does that even mean
[1:23:02] and it's so sly and so just carefully
[1:23:06] worded and carefully said well we're not
[1:23:08] following a man well
[1:23:09] uh when you're praying to that man when
[1:23:11] you're getting married to the with that
[1:23:13] man's voice when you're burying people
[1:23:14] with that man's voice i think you're
[1:23:16] i think you're you're pretty well
[1:23:18] following a man
[1:23:21] when you believe that when you have
[1:23:22] communion and you play a tape from
[1:23:24] brother branham coming to that communion
[1:23:26] service that brother branham is actually
[1:23:28] in spirit in that service
[1:23:30] serving communion you know what brother
[1:23:32] branham called that
[1:23:34] spiritualism and then he said it's of
[1:23:37] the devil
[1:23:39] communing with demonic spirits you don't
[1:23:41] commune with spirits of saints who have
[1:23:43] gone over the men and said is that
[1:23:44] spiritualism that's demonic worship
[1:23:48] you say brother man are you crying out
[1:23:50] against people not at all good godly
[1:23:52] people love the people real good godly
[1:23:55] people
[1:23:56] various brother branham said very
[1:23:57] sincere but very very sincerely wrong
[1:24:02] may god help us i said may god help us
[1:24:09] as paul says as such were some of you
[1:24:14] hello so it's not
[1:24:17] it it was it was notice this here
[1:24:19] because he says
[1:24:21] i i just want to go just if you have
[1:24:23] that power point brother peter i want to
[1:24:24] get to this to make sure we get to this
[1:24:26] tonight even if we run out of time
[1:24:28] i want to make sure we get to this
[1:24:29] brother aaron i hate to do this would
[1:24:31] you do me a favor and grab my
[1:24:33] power cord we have lost all power here
[1:24:35] in just a minute we're going to lose all
[1:24:37] power and i want to make sure we have
[1:24:38] the power point
[1:24:39] on the screen we'll need somewhere to
[1:24:41] plug that in
[1:24:44] sorry oh you don't my goodness well
[1:24:47] that's that's going to be important that
[1:24:49] we have that
[1:24:51] let me make sure i sent it to the right
[1:24:53] address i sent it to brother jeremy
[1:24:55] but jeremy may be to the uh the email i
[1:24:57] typically send it to
[1:24:59] could you go back there and get that
[1:25:00] pulled up thank you brother aaron you
[1:25:01] mind plugging that in for me
[1:25:04] you love him tonight
[1:25:08] sometimes you gotta depend on wires
[1:25:12] sometimes you know i forget what brother
[1:25:15] said it but he said uh
[1:25:16] that's not gonna reach maybe maybe it
[1:25:19] will it will good
[1:25:20] he said you know i'm so glad there won't
[1:25:22] be any liars in heaven and there won't
[1:25:24] be any wires in heaven either
[1:25:27] did he get that brother uh brother peter
[1:25:30] if he got that that'd be wonderful
[1:25:34] amen brother jeremy you're getting it
[1:25:36] okay if you could get it pulled up
[1:25:38] that'd be good
[1:25:39] so i want you to as we read some of
[1:25:41] these quotes as the brothers are just
[1:25:42] getting it pulled up
[1:25:44] i want you to watch how the prophet of
[1:25:46] god says this because
[1:25:48] as we said it's so important to follow
[1:25:50] some of the progression
[1:25:52] and and i'm being careful how i how we
[1:25:54] lay this out because i want to make sure
[1:25:56] that we
[1:25:57] we don't just gloss over it if we gloss
[1:25:59] over then it just creates more questions
[1:26:01] and i
[1:26:01] believe in having us things that are
[1:26:04] clear
[1:26:04] amen and not things that are
[1:26:06] misunderstood but you'll watch how
[1:26:08] brother baron begins to say some of the
[1:26:10] things that we're about to read in some
[1:26:12] of these quotes
[1:26:13] because so many even some have started
[1:26:16] to assert
[1:26:17] beyond those that have said the
[1:26:19] resurrection has passed
[1:26:20] and and that you know the rapture has
[1:26:22] already taken place and we miss the
[1:26:24] coming of the lord and we're in the
[1:26:25] tribulation now
[1:26:26] this is all tribulational stuff going on
[1:26:29] as off as that can be
[1:26:31] there are there are some things brother
[1:26:33] branham said that if you don't follow
[1:26:35] them in their proper
[1:26:36] context and their proper timeline
[1:26:39] of when he said them you'll
[1:26:42] misunderstand and say well hold on
[1:26:43] brother matt brother madam says this
[1:26:44] over here how does
[1:26:45] he say this over here so let's follow
[1:26:47] them today just here just for a moment
[1:26:50] prophet of god says what we need today i
[1:26:52] believe first
[1:26:54] is some good old-fashioned persecution
[1:26:57] to run us together now notice 1955
[1:27:01] we find out that when the church is
[1:27:03] really persecuted
[1:27:04] i believe that god is permitting
[1:27:06] communism to hit the land just keep
[1:27:08] going to the next
[1:27:09] slide there brother peter go to the next
[1:27:11] one and he says
[1:27:13] and oh is that the next one or maybe
[1:27:15] that's the third one go to this
[1:27:16] yeah but i believe my brethren there is
[1:27:19] coming
[1:27:20] an hour that when a real ranked
[1:27:22] persecution
[1:27:24] will run us together and you'll notice
[1:27:26] that if you go and search this out in
[1:27:28] the message
[1:27:28] he says this in a few places to if you
[1:27:31] type in to run
[1:27:32] us together i believe there's a
[1:27:34] persecution my brethren there's come in
[1:27:36] an
[1:27:36] hour that when a real ranked persecution
[1:27:39] will run us together
[1:27:40] then we will be one the church will come
[1:27:43] together
[1:27:44] i believe it's all in the making of god
[1:27:47] after painting this picture
[1:27:48] to you so notice what it's all for to
[1:27:51] bring us together to run us together
[1:27:53] to unify us now brother branham
[1:27:57] says this in the midst of a
[1:28:00] denominational church now you've got to
[1:28:02] understand
[1:28:03] he preaches a message called the seed
[1:28:05] shall not be heir with the shock you go
[1:28:07] back and listen to that message
[1:28:09] after he's pushed out of that
[1:28:11] denominational system
[1:28:12] after he's all the doors are closed
[1:28:14] after all the pulpits have shut him out
[1:28:17] he realizes it was even the revival that
[1:28:20] he thought was
[1:28:21] he was a part of was not the real
[1:28:23] revival because the real revival
[1:28:25] hadn't came yet and so he begins to say
[1:28:29] a real persecution that will
[1:28:31] really run us together he says then we
[1:28:34] will be won the church will come
[1:28:35] together
[1:28:36] i believe it's all in the making of god
[1:28:38] what's important to understand
[1:28:40] and we're going to make this as an
[1:28:41] important point
[1:28:43] brother brandon prior to the seals not
[1:28:46] that any things
[1:28:47] that not that we take we put on the
[1:28:49] shelf things that were pre-sealed
[1:28:51] not at all but prior to the seals
[1:28:55] brother burnham has
[1:28:56] a church view of the bible
[1:29:01] he has a church view of the bible
[1:29:05] or a denominational view of the bible or
[1:29:08] his baptist church
[1:29:09] view of the bible
[1:29:12] he looks at everything through those
[1:29:14] lens
[1:29:16] so when you read things like this you
[1:29:18] have to understand
[1:29:19] he's reading things or saying things
[1:29:21] from the lens of a
[1:29:23] church view and the entire bible even
[1:29:26] the book of revelations
[1:29:27] is a church view you said for the matter
[1:29:29] oh then it must have all but no no no
[1:29:31] no no the church had a lot of it right
[1:29:34] a lot of it right it's not that we just
[1:29:37] say oh the church view oh denominational
[1:29:39] view
[1:29:39] denomination of you has it very right we
[1:29:41] believe a lot of what they believe
[1:29:45] so the message of the hour was not a
[1:29:46] separation
[1:29:48] it was a further revelation it was more
[1:29:52] like to something you were already
[1:29:53] looking at it was
[1:29:54] to tie the loose ends even people
[1:29:58] brother brandon plagiarized larkin
[1:29:59] brother brandon plagiarized this man
[1:30:01] over here i
[1:30:01] i don't know how they can think that
[1:30:03] when brother branham himself
[1:30:05] admits you're only plagiarizing when you
[1:30:07] don't
[1:30:08] tell people who you're copying
[1:30:12] and brother and over and over says i've
[1:30:13] read larkin's dispensational truth i've
[1:30:15] read his books over here i've read the
[1:30:17] even before he preaches the seals he
[1:30:19] said i had studied and read them all and
[1:30:21] read them all and written all the notes
[1:30:23] down for it
[1:30:24] and he says oh what a terrible mistake i
[1:30:26] was about to make
[1:30:28] and he says until the angel showed up
[1:30:30] about two or three or four this
[1:30:31] afternoon
[1:30:32] and he said and showed me where i had it
[1:30:34] all wrong
[1:30:36] so he has a even his bible remember
[1:30:40] it's after the seals that brother
[1:30:42] branham says this became a brand new
[1:30:44] book
[1:30:47] hello this became a brand new book
[1:30:52] looked at it totally differently not
[1:30:53] that he threw out everything
[1:30:55] but now the picture has been focused
[1:30:59] it's clear he says but i believe my
[1:31:03] brother now
[1:31:03] even before that you say brother matt i
[1:31:06] have trouble with that
[1:31:07] i have trouble you saying that brother
[1:31:09] branham uh you know
[1:31:11] changed that that that he had a church
[1:31:13] well well then let's let brother branham
[1:31:14] do it himself here go to the next quote
[1:31:17] and oh this is the first seal and oh i
[1:31:20] would have
[1:31:21] absolutely today and i hope that people
[1:31:24] are spiritual
[1:31:25] i would have had a horrible mistake
[1:31:31] on that if it hadn't been about 12
[1:31:33] o'clock
[1:31:34] i was wrong there when the holy spirit
[1:31:36] came in the room and corrected me on
[1:31:38] something that i was
[1:31:40] writing down to say
[1:31:43] prior to the seals brother branham
[1:31:45] preaches
[1:31:46] that the white horse writer in the book
[1:31:48] of revelation is jesus christ
[1:31:51] you go on the table and you go search it
[1:31:53] up and you can listen to tapes and you
[1:31:54] hear brother adam say that now does that
[1:31:56] mean
[1:31:56] that we preach that the white horse
[1:31:59] writer in the book of revelations
[1:32:00] is christ well brother branham said it
[1:32:03] and that you got to say what he said
[1:32:05] hold on a minute brother branham says i
[1:32:07] would have made a horrible mistake god
[1:32:09] corrects him on that and he says that's
[1:32:11] not christ
[1:32:12] that's the spirit of the antichrist
[1:32:17] so notice this here he has so in other
[1:32:19] words
[1:32:20] if you can give brother branham grace to
[1:32:23] change
[1:32:23] that after then surely you can give
[1:32:26] brother baron him grace to change
[1:32:29] anything else that he brother branham
[1:32:30] says the angel of the lord had corrected
[1:32:32] him on that
[1:32:35] he says i wish you would i would have
[1:32:36] made a horrible mistake had it been
[1:32:38] notice this here
[1:32:39] uh he says it again continue to follow
[1:32:42] just this thought
[1:32:43] how are we going to lose this great face
[1:32:45] now notice the date
[1:32:46] this is 64 april he says how
[1:32:50] are we going to lose this great race
[1:32:53] it's because we're divided
[1:32:54] how we going to do it we got to stay
[1:32:56] together we're all believers in god the
[1:32:58] holy ghost takes us
[1:32:59] all in it'll be a paradox if god ever
[1:33:01] gets us together
[1:33:03] but he will just trust him the virgin
[1:33:06] birth
[1:33:06] he knows how to send
[1:33:09] the persecution that will run us
[1:33:14] together
[1:33:18] many have looked at these kind of
[1:33:19] statements that he said and said see
[1:33:20] brother the man it's coming they're
[1:33:21] going to come and close the doors
[1:33:23] they're going to shut down our churches
[1:33:24] and
[1:33:25] we won't be able to to preach anymore
[1:33:27] and they're going to hunt us down like
[1:33:28] dogs because there's a quote where
[1:33:29] brother brandon makes reference to that
[1:33:32] even though in that reference it's in
[1:33:33] the tribulation somehow people have
[1:33:35] pointed that and said that
[1:33:36] happens to us we'll all suffer we'll all
[1:33:39] have to be given our we'll have to give
[1:33:40] our lives we'll all be persecuted
[1:33:43] there's coming a great persecution he
[1:33:45] knows how to send the persecution that
[1:33:47] will run us together
[1:33:49] and in the court trial 64 in april 12 he
[1:33:52] says
[1:33:52] there is where i knew all the
[1:33:53] pentecostal groups come together then
[1:33:55] it'll take a persecution to run you
[1:33:58] people together you'll never believe it
[1:33:59] but when
[1:34:00] that time comes
[1:34:04] now if we were to stop there
[1:34:08] if we were just to pause there just for
[1:34:10] a moment let me make sure i don't want
[1:34:11] to
[1:34:12] display uh the second i sent also
[1:34:15] brother jeremy a pdf just forgive me
[1:34:17] friends
[1:34:18] can you give me a little grace here
[1:34:19] tonight i want to make sure i don't want
[1:34:22] to miss any of this and it was it was
[1:34:23] just
[1:34:24] too important to just skip over let me
[1:34:26] open it up on my screen to make sure
[1:34:28] that i didn't
[1:34:30] miss anything that i want the brothers
[1:34:31] to display and if i do you're just have
[1:34:33] to pause that just hold that
[1:34:35] there and so brother branham says
[1:34:39] he says uh he comes now
[1:34:42] we'll continue there i'll have you
[1:34:44] display that pdf in a moment
[1:34:46] he comes to this place and he's saying
[1:34:48] this now
[1:34:50] something takes place something
[1:34:53] happens the same exact way
[1:34:57] that it happened
[1:35:01] in the seals something takes place
[1:35:05] in august of the same year
[1:35:08] brother branham is going to preach the
[1:35:11] feast of the trumpets
[1:35:14] now even prior to this trumpets brother
[1:35:16] brandon buys himself a plane ticket
[1:35:18] actually goes to israel thinking he's
[1:35:21] preached the seals next will come the
[1:35:23] viles then the trumpets and
[1:35:24] and and brother branham's wondering is
[1:35:26] this my place and the holy spirit stops
[1:35:28] him and says no no
[1:35:29] it's not your it's not the time and it's
[1:35:32] not your place
[1:35:34] because what the seals were to the
[1:35:37] gentiles the trumpets are to the jews
[1:35:41] and so he preaches this message the
[1:35:43] feast of the trumpets and something
[1:35:45] takes place
[1:35:46] in that message i don't have it here on
[1:35:48] the screen to display the
[1:35:50] the correct quote but i just want to go
[1:35:52] on
[1:35:53] i want to show you what is the
[1:35:54] tribulation for if you'll pull that pdf
[1:35:56] up brother you can do that
[1:35:59] because here's here's what here's what
[1:36:01] it uh the
[1:36:02] great tribulation that the bible speaks
[1:36:04] of uh calls it
[1:36:06] a day that will never ha there's never
[1:36:08] been a day like it
[1:36:10] and no there'll never be another day
[1:36:12] like it the great day of the lord
[1:36:14] remember that in the bible and so what
[1:36:17] is the tribulation for what's
[1:36:19] its purpose why does god need to send
[1:36:21] this tribulation let's find out
[1:36:23] and the seventh seal you can just on the
[1:36:25] bottom right there there's a plus button
[1:36:27] you can go quite a bit bigger
[1:36:28] than that just go till they can yep it's
[1:36:30] a little bit you maybe have trouble
[1:36:32] seeing that
[1:36:33] for the peter going up up up up right
[1:36:36] there
[1:36:36] down right there click click click keep
[1:36:39] clicking
[1:36:40] you in the back can you see that
[1:36:43] perfect you can just scroll over just a
[1:36:45] little bit
[1:36:50] we're cutting off some of the right edge
[1:36:52] there
[1:36:54] amen just scroll over just a little bit
[1:36:55] you should be able to do that
[1:36:58] i yeah just try to scroll in try to
[1:37:00] scroll in again until it does that keep
[1:37:02] going keep going
[1:37:03] one more time right there can you see
[1:37:05] that maybe once more
[1:37:06] there perfect he says the first thing
[1:37:09] was the sleeping virgin had to go
[1:37:11] through the tribulation
[1:37:13] for purification she had to be
[1:37:18] purged is the tribulation
[1:37:21] it's the purging he says she had to be
[1:37:24] purged of her sins
[1:37:26] of unbelief and rejecting the message
[1:37:30] this she was done in the tribulation
[1:37:32] period
[1:37:33] he cares do you care we're at the end
[1:37:35] time
[1:37:36] and we see we're at the end there's no
[1:37:38] not no way to build upon that corruption
[1:37:41] how can we build a city upon the charred
[1:37:43] ruins of sodom of a sodom and gomorrah
[1:37:45] how can we do it there's only one
[1:37:47] phoenix left
[1:37:48] and that's the coming of the lord jesus
[1:37:52] oh my a purification
[1:37:55] through the tribulation period to bring
[1:37:57] back a restoring of a world
[1:38:00] for a people who are just in the sight
[1:38:03] of god
[1:38:04] and live by his word
[1:38:08] you say brother matt what is the
[1:38:09] tribulation period for
[1:38:11] the tribulation is for the earth
[1:38:15] what the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:38:17] for you
[1:38:18] now the tribulation period to the earth
[1:38:23] which remember the earth is just not to
[1:38:25] be cast off it's not a new earth
[1:38:28] it's not brother madam says what is it
[1:38:30] he said it's this same earth
[1:38:32] remodeled
[1:38:36] it'll be completely redone because how
[1:38:37] you say brother matt why wouldn't he
[1:38:38] just create in the earth because brother
[1:38:39] brandon says it's part of the book of
[1:38:40] life
[1:38:41] it's an eternal attribute of god mother
[1:38:43] earth mother
[1:38:44] the earth that you came from
[1:38:48] it's part of god it's an eternal
[1:38:50] attribute of god even the apostle paul
[1:38:51] says
[1:38:52] all creation all the earth groaneth and
[1:38:55] traveleth within itself waiting for the
[1:38:57] manifestation what's it doing it's in
[1:38:59] birth pains the same
[1:39:00] exact way that you look at sin and your
[1:39:03] life and go i don't want it lord get
[1:39:05] get rid of it god clean me of it god
[1:39:08] purge me of it
[1:39:08] is the same way the earth is groaning at
[1:39:11] sinful
[1:39:12] mankind saying get rid of it lord burn
[1:39:15] it god get
[1:39:16] annihilate it and brother branham says
[1:39:18] one day he will
[1:39:21] one day the elements shall mur shall
[1:39:24] melt with
[1:39:24] fervent heat what's it going to be it's
[1:39:28] going to already been
[1:39:29] it's already been baptized under noah's
[1:39:31] baptism it's already been
[1:39:33] sanctified by the blood at calvary it's
[1:39:35] only needing a
[1:39:36] fiery cleansing when all of the elements
[1:39:40] melt with fervent heat
[1:39:43] and it will purge itself
[1:39:46] can you say man to bring back he says
[1:39:50] a purification through the tribulation
[1:39:51] and bring back a restoring of a world
[1:39:53] for a people
[1:39:54] why is the earth purged for you because
[1:39:58] the earth has to match the purification
[1:40:01] that's inside of you you say i don't
[1:40:04] have it right now but one day we will
[1:40:06] one day the bible paul said i know not
[1:40:08] what we shall be when he appeared but
[1:40:10] here's what we know
[1:40:11] we shall be like him in his very image
[1:40:15] i say lord i'm looking forward to that
[1:40:17] day when i match
[1:40:18] this when i look in the mirror and i see
[1:40:21] this looking
[1:40:22] back at me when me and this become as
[1:40:24] brother adam says what you never dreamed
[1:40:26] possible
[1:40:31] and the earth has to match the condition
[1:40:33] the atmosphere is the earth
[1:40:34] matches what god has done in his family
[1:40:38] can you say amen he says now
[1:40:41] notice this this is questions and
[1:40:43] answers then at this time then at that
[1:40:45] time see the gentile bride is in heaven
[1:40:48] the sleeping virgin the gentile virgin
[1:40:50] is not to be saved during that time
[1:40:52] she's already been saved but has been
[1:40:55] rejected in the bride
[1:40:56] she only goes through the tribulation
[1:40:59] period for the time of purification
[1:41:02] because she has rejected christ not
[1:41:04] jesus of nazareth
[1:41:06] the word not a story not a sunday school
[1:41:10] lesson
[1:41:11] but she's rejected christ the word
[1:41:14] uh he says he says uh for her
[1:41:17] purification then she had to suffer
[1:41:20] for her deeds but the bride are you the
[1:41:23] bride
[1:41:24] who has become the word a complete
[1:41:27] atonement was made of christ because he
[1:41:29] is the word
[1:41:30] the body was rendered and when that body
[1:41:32] was rendered the bride
[1:41:34] was in that body because it's all the
[1:41:36] word
[1:41:37] amen you see it he says in conflict
[1:41:40] between god and satan there's no place
[1:41:42] where the church
[1:41:43] ever goes through the tribulation period
[1:41:46] christ's blood and the fullness of the
[1:41:49] application of the blood of jesus christ
[1:41:51] cleanses
[1:41:52] all sin
[1:41:57] now pull up my power point if you could
[1:41:59] i want you to notice brother branham has
[1:42:00] asked this specifically
[1:42:02] and questions and answers he's asked
[1:42:04] very
[1:42:05] very specific the next quote after that
[1:42:08] one
[1:42:09] brother branham will the bride go
[1:42:12] through the persecution
[1:42:14] as the early apostolic church did
[1:42:17] drum roll please
[1:42:21] you ready for this long theological get
[1:42:24] out your pins and papers
[1:42:26] no that's it
[1:42:31] that's it no
[1:42:34] i just explained that a few minutes ago
[1:42:37] no
[1:42:38] next thing is a rapture
[1:42:41] now remember we're at the promised land
[1:42:45] we're at the border you understand the
[1:42:46] march of israel
[1:42:47] no will the bride be persecuted no the
[1:42:50] next thing for the bride
[1:42:52] is rapture say brother matt why does
[1:42:54] that make you excited because then that
[1:42:56] tells me
[1:42:57] no matter what happens in this earth in
[1:42:59] my time
[1:43:00] on earth no matter what happens tomorrow
[1:43:02] at the white house
[1:43:03] or no matter where you want to point to
[1:43:06] it doesn't affect me because the next
[1:43:07] thing for me
[1:43:09] is to get out of here one day
[1:43:13] he says no the next thing is the rapture
[1:43:17] the next slide if there isn't he says no
[1:43:19] notice but i was thinking is this
[1:43:20] precious godly brother
[1:43:22] john go to the next one i may i may skip
[1:43:24] that next one there
[1:43:25] back up there he sees the martyr's altar
[1:43:27] he says now they were not under the
[1:43:29] altar of sacrifice mine wasn't
[1:43:31] but these they were martyrs mine wasn't
[1:43:33] under the martyr's altar
[1:43:34] i want you to tell i want you to listen
[1:43:36] real close and i'll close honestly about
[1:43:37] in 10 minutes
[1:43:38] he says go to the next slide there he
[1:43:41] says look they were not my the ones that
[1:43:43] the lord showed me the bride
[1:43:45] she was not under the martyr's block no
[1:43:48] the sacrifice altar of the martyrs but
[1:43:50] had received white robes
[1:43:52] by accepting in the pardoning grace of
[1:43:54] the living word christ had to give them
[1:43:57] a white robe she wasn't under the
[1:44:00] martyr's block is there one after that
[1:44:01] brother
[1:44:02] oh don't you see where we're at don't
[1:44:05] you see now this is in feast of trumpets
[1:44:08] he says don't you see why them trumpets
[1:44:11] means
[1:44:12] nothing to us
[1:44:15] means nothing to us they all
[1:44:19] sounded under our sixth seal you see why
[1:44:22] the holy spirit wouldn't let me speak it
[1:44:26] now i don't have i apologize i wanted to
[1:44:28] have this i don't think let me just
[1:44:30] check and go to the next one there that
[1:44:32] should be
[1:44:32] there it is thank you lord jesus i do
[1:44:34] have that there
[1:44:36] this is in feast now paul's that just
[1:44:38] for a moment now
[1:44:39] remember how we said brother brandon
[1:44:41] before the seals he says before
[1:44:43] he says i was about to make a terrible
[1:44:45] mistake
[1:44:46] and he said just about to make a
[1:44:48] terrible mistake he said till the lord
[1:44:50] jesus showed up
[1:44:51] now up until this point brother branham
[1:44:54] is you read
[1:44:54] persecution's coming watch the squeeze
[1:44:57] watch the third pull then
[1:44:59] when it will really manifest itself he
[1:45:02] says you watch there will be a
[1:45:03] persecution that comes
[1:45:04] to run us together but now watch
[1:45:06] everything
[1:45:07] change and you say when did it change
[1:45:10] brother matt well let's read when it
[1:45:12] changed
[1:45:13] back up one more quote i want to read
[1:45:14] the one we just read again oh don't you
[1:45:16] see where we're at
[1:45:17] don't you understand why them trumpets
[1:45:19] mean nothing to us they all sound
[1:45:21] another six seal you see why the holy
[1:45:22] spirit wouldn't let me speak about it
[1:45:24] speak it and the heavenly father knows
[1:45:27] with this bible before me that's the
[1:45:29] truth
[1:45:32] didn't know it till yesterday
[1:45:37] i didn't know it until yesterday
[1:45:41] he says in my room just like in the
[1:45:44] seals
[1:45:45] in my room there where he revealed it
[1:45:49] come to me and spoke to me i come back i
[1:45:51] said wife i've got it now
[1:45:53] he just met me in there and told me here
[1:45:55] it is
[1:45:56] honey see there it is see perfectly just
[1:45:58] in harmony
[1:46:00] you see brother brother matt was that
[1:46:02] important because that means that prior
[1:46:04] to yesterday which would have been
[1:46:06] the saturday before this
[1:46:09] everything brother branham had looked at
[1:46:11] was persecution persecution persecution
[1:46:14] and now he says then the angel of the
[1:46:16] lord came and revealed to me
[1:46:17] that has nothing to do with us
[1:46:23] yeah amen is right praise the lord is
[1:46:27] right
[1:46:27] thank you jesus is right some of some
[1:46:30] believers ought to be going
[1:46:32] thank god but isn't this what the bible
[1:46:36] teaches
[1:46:37] we're not we're not we're not ordained
[1:46:39] to wrath
[1:46:41] that's not what the bride that's not
[1:46:42] what the body of christ is ordained to
[1:46:44] jesus says though that you may escape
[1:46:47] these things and stand before the son of
[1:46:48] man
[1:46:49] he says i didn't know it till yesterday
[1:46:51] day before yes in my room where he
[1:46:52] revealed it
[1:46:53] go keep going brother oh people without
[1:46:56] him
[1:46:56] get in quick it might be the last
[1:46:58] opportunity you will ever be able to
[1:47:00] have you don't know what time he might
[1:47:02] come
[1:47:03] so was brother branham still looking for
[1:47:05] the coming
[1:47:08] was he still looking for the coming of
[1:47:10] the lord or had that already passed
[1:47:13] did that happen on the ohio river that
[1:47:15] wasn't the coming of the lord
[1:47:17] brother branham says the coming of the
[1:47:19] lord he says it's a
[1:47:20] physical keep going in the next slide
[1:47:22] there he says now people say
[1:47:24] what about the early saints i think i
[1:47:26] have it he says that was the changing of
[1:47:28] the dispensations that was under
[1:47:29] persecution
[1:47:30] which if you was here to hear this
[1:47:32] church is now this is questions and
[1:47:33] answers this is just the next month
[1:47:37] he says if you were to hear the church
[1:47:38] ages and to see how they went into that
[1:47:40] darkness and had to do that
[1:47:41] i had to do that then that shows where
[1:47:43] they had to take that persecution
[1:47:46] keep going because each one of the
[1:47:48] church ages and everything began to show
[1:47:50] that they were darker and darker so they
[1:47:51] finally went to a complete place
[1:47:53] that they denied his name and picked up
[1:47:54] another name that they lived and were
[1:47:55] dead and sardis
[1:47:57] and then it come on out thy tyrus sardis
[1:47:59] then come out began to come out to
[1:48:00] philadelphia and so forth
[1:48:02] then come to the time of the calling out
[1:48:03] of the bride which was to escape
[1:48:06] somebody say this together all
[1:48:09] damnation calling out of the bride to
[1:48:12] escape
[1:48:13] all damnation it counted
[1:48:16] worthy to escape all this damnation and
[1:48:19] wrath
[1:48:20] that's to come upon the earth that you
[1:48:22] might be counted worthy to escape it
[1:48:24] not go through it escape it that's him
[1:48:27] quoting the book of luke
[1:48:30] that you'd be sober that that you'd be
[1:48:32] not drunken with the cares of this life
[1:48:34] or surfing he says that you may be
[1:48:37] counted worthy to stand before the son
[1:48:39] of man and escape
[1:48:40] all these things and he says
[1:48:43] it kind of worthy he says not he says he
[1:48:46] says that you might be kind of worthy to
[1:48:47] escape it
[1:48:48] not go through it escape it
[1:48:52] do you understand now everybody i
[1:48:55] understand
[1:48:56] thank you lord next one here brother if
[1:48:59] we got an
[1:48:59] if we got another one another slide
[1:49:01] there just go to the the powerpoint
[1:49:03] or the the pdf then notice he says this
[1:49:06] he says where where we were in the in
[1:49:08] the pdf that you had pulled up
[1:49:10] he says there's no place where the
[1:49:12] church ever goes through the tribulation
[1:49:14] period
[1:49:15] christ's blood and the fullness of the
[1:49:17] application of the blind you say brother
[1:49:19] matt does that mean hold on
[1:49:20] pause that brother man oh good i escaped
[1:49:22] tribulation no you missed it
[1:49:25] that means i escaped any kind of purging
[1:49:27] no you missed it
[1:49:30] you see the only difference is is that
[1:49:31] your tribulation which is to be purged
[1:49:34] is happening right now
[1:49:38] so that you don't have to have purging
[1:49:40] there
[1:49:41] christ is purging you now
[1:49:45] he says there's no place where the
[1:49:46] church ever goes to the tribulation
[1:49:47] christ's blood and the fullness of the
[1:49:48] application of blood jesus cleanses all
[1:49:50] sin
[1:49:51] and why do we have to be purged we are
[1:49:53] purged
[1:49:54] daily no tribulation listen
[1:49:57] listen what jesus said saint john 5 24
[1:49:59] that hear with my words believeth on him
[1:50:01] that sent me
[1:50:02] hath everlasting life and shall not
[1:50:05] come to the judgment but is passed from
[1:50:08] death unto life
[1:50:10] questions and answers standing in line
[1:50:11] to get into the church is going to be
[1:50:13] only a memory
[1:50:14] what's going to happen this is a
[1:50:15] question if we're not going through the
[1:50:16] tribulation
[1:50:17] are we to be see are we to be seen same
[1:50:21] some suffering
[1:50:22] if we're not brother branham gets he
[1:50:24] starts to read the question
[1:50:26] are we going to see some suffering now i
[1:50:28] want to pause here and say brother matt
[1:50:29] that means we don't suffer at all no
[1:50:32] the bible says all who live godly we
[1:50:34] heard it wednesday
[1:50:36] all who live godly in christ will suffer
[1:50:38] persecution
[1:50:40] we have brothers and sisters over in
[1:50:42] syria and in turkey who are persecuted
[1:50:44] daily
[1:50:46] you want to talk about serving the lord
[1:50:47] and and having to have a real testimony
[1:50:51] go live in syria go live in turkey we
[1:50:53] got a brother
[1:50:54] of jason to mars who travels there and
[1:50:56] is missionary to there that's
[1:50:58] real living faith every day
[1:51:01] persecuted there's big saints of he said
[1:51:03] brother matt is that unique no that's
[1:51:05] been
[1:51:06] happening since the days of the apostles
[1:51:12] amen i don't feel we need to even say
[1:51:13] any more on that you understand that
[1:51:15] he says tribulation are we to be some
[1:51:18] suffering if not
[1:51:19] this question is probably i'm trying to
[1:51:20] hurry i'll not do this ought to lay
[1:51:22] these back because there's a place you
[1:51:23] could stay in
[1:51:24] on an hour just tear it down i'll stop
[1:51:26] keep going keep scrolling down
[1:51:28] nope other way keep coming down
[1:51:32] he says look the people are wanting to
[1:51:34] say thinking that the church is going to
[1:51:36] hit the tribulation see
[1:51:37] it won't it can't because it's already
[1:51:41] redeemed now the church the nominal
[1:51:44] believers like lot he's going through
[1:51:46] the tribulation period
[1:51:48] and be saved as if it was by fire
[1:51:51] noah went through the tribulation period
[1:51:52] just the type carried above it
[1:51:55] come out with him ham who polluted the
[1:51:56] earth again see lot came out his own
[1:51:58] daughter slept with him
[1:51:59] and had children by his own daughter see
[1:52:00] but abraham brought forth the royal seed
[1:52:03] brought forth the seed of the promise
[1:52:05] enoch went to glory in the rapture
[1:52:07] just took a walk and went home he never
[1:52:09] went through the tribulation period you
[1:52:11] see
[1:52:12] there you are the bible cannot he says
[1:52:15] these types can't fail
[1:52:17] it does not predict that the bride now
[1:52:19] the church will go through the
[1:52:20] tribulation period
[1:52:21] now the people say what about the early
[1:52:23] saints that was the changing of
[1:52:25] dispensations we've already read that
[1:52:27] keep going down to 233. he says the
[1:52:30] church the lukewarm anything
[1:52:31] outside of the elected bride will go
[1:52:34] through the tribulation
[1:52:35] they will not raise in the first
[1:52:36] resurrection the rest of the dead live
[1:52:38] not for a thousand years
[1:52:39] just the four ordained predestinated
[1:52:42] elected bride god's own
[1:52:44] election who is it brother branham so
[1:52:47] arrogant and so elite of course it's me
[1:52:52] who is it brother branham i love this
[1:52:55] who is it then brother branham oh i love
[1:52:58] how he says it
[1:52:59] i don't know i can't tell you who it is
[1:53:03] but i know it's going to be there
[1:53:04] because the lord said they would
[1:53:06] they are the ones that will go up from
[1:53:08] the tribulation but the rest of them
[1:53:10] will go through the tribulation who is
[1:53:12] it brother branham
[1:53:13] i don't know but there will be somebody
[1:53:15] i say put your name there have enough
[1:53:17] faith to say lord if it's going to be
[1:53:19] somebody let it be my life
[1:53:20] let it be me lord let it be this church
[1:53:22] let it be my home god
[1:53:26] there's no elitist title that because
[1:53:29] you go to this church or
[1:53:30] this was your pastor you were part of
[1:53:32] this family none of that
[1:53:34] even the prophet himself he was asked in
[1:53:36] another place
[1:53:38] is your name on the lamb's book of life
[1:53:39] but the random says i don't know
[1:53:41] but i believe by faith that it is
[1:53:46] i have that same faith
[1:53:50] notice this here he says he says uh
[1:53:54] keep keep going down brother just keep
[1:53:56] scrolling that down what is it done in
[1:53:58] the cunningness
[1:54:00] he said he come like unlike flatteries
[1:54:02] and what has he done
[1:54:03] he is bringing the protestant ecumenical
[1:54:05] council of the world churches the spirit
[1:54:06] of antichrist upon both of them
[1:54:08] bringing them to the slider just like
[1:54:10] they did the other in the hour to call
[1:54:11] the bride how
[1:54:13] loose in the ecclesiastical church
[1:54:15] spirit loosed upon what
[1:54:17] not upon the denominations upon the
[1:54:19] bride so what is
[1:54:20] the bride while while the while the
[1:54:23] israel receives
[1:54:24] a physical persecution the gentile bride
[1:54:28] is persecuted spiritually
[1:54:33] ecclesiastically by an ecclesiastical
[1:54:37] church
[1:54:37] spirit that tries to destroy our
[1:54:40] churches
[1:54:41] tries to take away the power of the
[1:54:42] preaching of the word of god
[1:54:44] tries to make us cold and formal and
[1:54:46] lukewarm
[1:54:47] and indifferent and traditional
[1:54:50] you say brother man what spirit is going
[1:54:52] to come and attack our church it won't
[1:54:54] be a physical army
[1:54:55] that comes and shuts this church down it
[1:54:58] will be a demonic force that presses
[1:55:00] against
[1:55:01] us and rushes in like a flood and tells
[1:55:04] us to stop preaching the word of god
[1:55:06] stop trying to stop hurting the people's
[1:55:08] feelings itching ears to try to get a
[1:55:10] teacher to tell them something they want
[1:55:11] to hear
[1:55:12] it'll be a spirit that tries to make us
[1:55:14] cold formal
[1:55:15] lukewarm and powerless but the bible
[1:55:18] says when the spirit
[1:55:20] comes in like a flood the spirit of god
[1:55:23] raises up a standard against him
[1:55:28] that's the spirit that you've got to
[1:55:30] fight
[1:55:32] bring them to the slaughter he says not
[1:55:33] upon the nominations behind the bride
[1:55:35] but here you'll get it
[1:55:37] let's get it the bride will not go
[1:55:40] through
[1:55:40] that time the bible says the church will
[1:55:43] but not the bride can't you
[1:55:45] see ministers can't you see that
[1:55:48] brethren
[1:55:48] you say the church has got to has to go
[1:55:51] through the persecution
[1:55:53] the church has to go through the
[1:55:54] persecution for the perfection of it
[1:55:57] brother branham says the blood of jesus
[1:56:00] christ perfects the bride
[1:56:05] a man who chooses a wife don't put her
[1:56:07] through a lot of punishment even those
[1:56:09] who believe in a post
[1:56:11] a pre-trib and post-trib rapture people
[1:56:14] who believe in a
[1:56:15] post-tribulation rapture i think how
[1:56:19] how would that even make sense that you
[1:56:22] believe that god's going to rapture us
[1:56:24] out
[1:56:25] after all of the persecution i thought i
[1:56:28] was his wife
[1:56:29] that's the same thing brother branham
[1:56:30] goes to i thought she was the elected
[1:56:33] lady
[1:56:33] who he's purchased with his own blood
[1:56:35] that so ought you men to love your wife
[1:56:37] so as christ loved the church and gave
[1:56:39] himself for it
[1:56:41] and you mean to tell me he's going to
[1:56:43] espouse us it'd be like a man
[1:56:47] be like a man espousing getting engaged
[1:56:49] and then uh
[1:56:50] physically abusing his future wife
[1:56:54] beating her and then saying
[1:56:58] okay now that's all over now let's uh
[1:56:59] let's go have dinner or something
[1:57:02] you realize you'd laugh but that's
[1:57:04] exactly what you'd have to believe
[1:57:06] if you believe in a post-tribulation
[1:57:08] rapture listen how brother brandon picks
[1:57:10] this up
[1:57:10] you say the church has got to go brother
[1:57:12] adam says the blood of jesus perfects
[1:57:13] the bride
[1:57:14] a man who chooses a wife don't put her
[1:57:17] through a lot of punishment
[1:57:19] he's already found grace too with her
[1:57:22] she's found grace with him he engages to
[1:57:26] her and if there's
[1:57:27] anything in other words if anything
[1:57:29] comes up in her life
[1:57:31] he'll keep her from every place to turn
[1:57:34] her hand
[1:57:35] his grace is so great upon
[1:57:38] them oh you ought to rejoice church
[1:57:42] you want to say thank you jesus for that
[1:57:44] grace and so it will be upon the bride
[1:57:47] and so
[1:57:48] is it on the bride we unworthy creatures
[1:57:51] can you can you identify with that
[1:57:54] deserving of hell but his grace
[1:57:57] holds us through it that's the reason i
[1:58:01] do believe that when the bride is called
[1:58:03] and elected
[1:58:03] and said in the book of life there will
[1:58:05] come a sound from heaven
[1:58:07] oh this is my blessed hope here that'll
[1:58:09] take such a baptism of the holy spirit
[1:58:12] into that bride
[1:58:12] that'll take her from the earth in a
[1:58:15] rapturing grace
[1:58:16] god promised it i don't care how many
[1:58:18] science how many astronauts they signed
[1:58:20] up
[1:58:21] and everything else how many million
[1:58:23] miles they can see
[1:58:24] i don't care nothing about it there is a
[1:58:27] heaven
[1:58:28] and there is a literal jesus christ
[1:58:31] there that will come in a body form to
[1:58:34] receive his church to himself
[1:58:36] no matter how old the story seems
[1:58:40] it's still the truth god
[1:58:43] said so that's what believers
[1:58:47] believe that's
[1:58:50] what believers believe
[1:58:55] lights on if you could brothers no
[1:58:57] matter how old the story gets
[1:59:01] there is a literal not spiritual
[1:59:05] there is a literal physical bodily form
[1:59:09] of jesus christ that's going to come
[1:59:11] back one day
[1:59:12] and he's going to take you and your
[1:59:14] family and your children
[1:59:16] he's going to take us all to glory
[1:59:20] i want to close here just just here in
[1:59:22] just a moment
[1:59:24] can you give me oh my we're out of time
[1:59:26] can you give me about 10 minutes can you
[1:59:28] can i hear a good amen give me about 10
[1:59:30] minutes thank you
[1:59:34] first thessalonians 4. let's go back to
[1:59:35] that here just brother jeremy just here
[1:59:37] for a moment
[1:59:38] he says for this we say by the word of
[1:59:40] the lord
[1:59:42] let me let me make sure i got the right
[1:59:44] the right spot here
[1:59:51] yes he says let's just pick up verse 16.
[1:59:54] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:59:56] heaven with the shout the voice of the
[1:59:57] archangel
[1:59:58] with the trump of god and the dead and
[1:59:59] christ shall rise first then we which
[2:00:01] are alive and remain shall be
[2:00:06] caught up now this word caught up is the
[2:00:09] word
[2:00:09] harpazo amazing because this word's used
[2:00:13] multiple times in the bible
[2:00:15] it's a it's a word here i want to read
[2:00:18] it just one more time it says we which
[2:00:20] are alive
[2:00:20] shall be caught up that word in english
[2:00:23] means to be snatched
[2:00:25] to be snatched you ever snatch something
[2:00:28] out of someone's hand
[2:00:29] out of your child's hand maybe you
[2:00:31] snatch it out of their hand
[2:00:32] you're snatching something you're you're
[2:00:35] saying give me give me that back
[2:00:37] children do that to their brothers older
[2:00:39] brothers do that to the younger sisters
[2:00:41] give me that back that's mine
[2:00:42] what are they doing they're snatching it
[2:00:44] out of their hand this is exactly what
[2:00:46] the bible is saying
[2:00:47] we shall be snatched we shall be pulled
[2:00:51] out of it
[2:00:51] we shall be at the moment destruction's
[2:00:53] about to fall god will come down and
[2:00:55] snatch us out of it what's he going to
[2:00:58] do
[2:00:59] he's going to be taking back what's his
[2:01:03] hallelujah notice this here this word
[2:01:07] means to seize
[2:01:09] to carry off we shall be harponzo
[2:01:13] we shall be seized we shall be carried
[2:01:17] off by
[2:01:17] force to seize on to claim for one's
[2:01:21] self eagerly to snatch out
[2:01:25] or away this word harponzo was found 17
[2:01:29] times in the new testament
[2:01:31] and the greek new testament and 13 and
[2:01:34] 13 different verses
[2:01:35] and every single time you'll find this
[2:01:37] word we're going to look at some
[2:01:38] examples here
[2:01:39] harpanzo it's referred to as a quick
[2:01:43] that's why paul says in the moment in a
[2:01:45] moment
[2:01:46] in the twinkling of an eye just that
[2:01:48] fast it'll it'll happen just that quick
[2:01:50] it's every time you read about it it's a
[2:01:52] fast quick violent
[2:01:54] rapid pulling away and he says
[2:01:58] it's a thing of thinking of an idea so
[2:02:00] it's used it refers to now notice here's
[2:02:02] something else important we
[2:02:04] shall be caught up together did you know
[2:02:06] called up
[2:02:08] that word harpazo specifically when i
[2:02:11] clicked on it and i thought this was
[2:02:13] just amazing
[2:02:14] it says not spiritually but literally
[2:02:19] so every single time it's used it's
[2:02:21] never used in a spiritual sense
[2:02:23] it's used physically
[2:02:26] literally substantively
[2:02:30] something happened something
[2:02:33] happens and in fact every time it's used
[2:02:36] it's used as a physical
[2:02:38] bodily snatching a removal
[2:02:42] from one place to another place
[2:02:45] from one sphere to another sphere
[2:02:48] from one condition to another condition
[2:02:51] from a world that's in chaos to a world
[2:02:54] that is peace
[2:02:57] snatched away the five times harponzo is
[2:03:00] used
[2:03:01] it it talks about people you notice you
[2:03:03] remember the scripture we'll turn there
[2:03:05] if we could turn to the book of acts if
[2:03:07] you have your bible just turn over to
[2:03:09] the book of acts or they could
[2:03:10] display it may be quicker to acts
[2:03:11] chapter eight uh brother maybe you can
[2:03:14] just write it down just for
[2:03:15] so for time's sake in acts chapter eight
[2:03:19] used very uh very literally here i want
[2:03:22] you you've probably read this before in
[2:03:24] your bible
[2:03:28] he says here in acts chapter eight and
[2:03:30] let's just skip on down to
[2:03:32] uh let's go to verse
[2:03:36] 38 37 and philip said if thou believeth
[2:03:39] with all the heart thou mayest and he
[2:03:40] answered and said i believe that jesus
[2:03:41] christ is the son of god this is acts 8
[2:03:43] 39 and when they were come up out of the
[2:03:46] water
[2:03:47] display that if you could brother peter
[2:03:48] brother yeah thank you and when they
[2:03:50] were come up
[2:03:51] out of the water the spirit of the lord
[2:03:54] harpazo
[2:03:57] the spirit of the lord snatched the
[2:04:00] spirit of the lord
[2:04:01] grabbed the spirit of the lord violently
[2:04:03] pulled peter
[2:04:04] caught him away philip that the eunuch
[2:04:07] saw him no more and he went on his way
[2:04:09] the next time philip's seen he's in
[2:04:10] another city
[2:04:14] you see the rapture that we're waiting
[2:04:16] on there's already been raptures that
[2:04:17] you can go read about in the bible
[2:04:19] you just think of enoch the bible says
[2:04:21] he walked with god and he was not
[2:04:23] think of elijah who was caught up in a
[2:04:25] chariot philip who was
[2:04:26] translated philip who was raptured
[2:04:29] philip who was
[2:04:30] harpazo snatched away god just pulls him
[2:04:34] out
[2:04:34] and the eunuch saw him no more what did
[2:04:37] the eunuch do it went on his way
[2:04:38] rejoicing
[2:04:41] and the next time philip hassini's in
[2:04:42] another city what was it it was the
[2:04:45] power of god
[2:04:46] physically not spiritually physically
[2:04:48] pulling
[2:04:49] removing a person
[2:04:52] from one place and putting them in
[2:04:55] another place
[2:04:56] what is the rapture it's the removal
[2:04:59] from this place
[2:05:00] to another place a real place
[2:05:04] brother brandon said it wasn't i i
[2:05:06] realized it wasn't us brother me and
[2:05:08] brother neville over there on harps
[2:05:09] floating around on clouds he said it was
[2:05:10] a real place
[2:05:11] with real people living real life
[2:05:13] breathing a real world jesus said
[2:05:17] to that day that he's preparing a place
[2:05:19] could you imagine
[2:05:20] how beautiful that place must be
[2:05:24] even this world that you live in do you
[2:05:26] know that the world that you have
[2:05:28] contacted since the day you breathed
[2:05:29] your first breath
[2:05:31] is a world that is under a curse
[2:05:35] it's a cursed earth yet
[2:05:38] it's beautiful it's a curse have you
[2:05:42] ever thought about that
[2:05:43] it's a cursed earth yet you can see some
[2:05:46] of the prettiest things in this earth
[2:05:48] you make postcards about it
[2:05:50] you take pictures and think oh how
[2:05:51] beautiful do you realize
[2:05:53] that is the earth under a curse imagine
[2:05:56] the beauty when the curse is lifted
[2:06:00] you think it's beautiful now jesus said
[2:06:02] i'm going to prepare a place
[2:06:05] that where i am there you may be also
[2:06:10] snatched pulled out seized
[2:06:17] you love him notice this here even paul
[2:06:22] you can go read and we won't we won't
[2:06:23] take time to read it when paul uses
[2:06:25] uses this word and he speaks of this in
[2:06:28] second in second corinthians and paul
[2:06:30] says i knew a man
[2:06:31] now he's speaking of himself in the
[2:06:33] third person
[2:06:34] he says who was called up who was
[2:06:36] translated
[2:06:38] that that's the word harponzo to the
[2:06:40] third heaven and seen things that is not
[2:06:42] lawful to be uttered i knew a man

[2:06:52] to the third heaven verse three let's
[2:06:54] keep going there
[2:06:56] and he says and he says and he and he he
[2:06:58] says he heard things that were unlawful
[2:07:00] to speak up he
[2:07:01] paul couldn't even speak about it just
[2:07:04] go to the next verse if you got it
[2:07:06] brother brother
[2:07:06] uh verse three you got it pulled up we
[2:07:08] might as well read it now second
[2:07:09] corinthians 12 verse three
[2:07:11] and i knew such a man whether in the
[2:07:13] body or out of the body i could not tell
[2:07:15] god know us verse
[2:07:16] verse 4 just keep going how that he was
[2:07:18] caught up into paradise snatched up
[2:07:20] seized up and heard unspeakable words
[2:07:23] which is not lawful for a man
[2:07:25] to utter even the bible speaks of this
[2:07:28] in
[2:07:28] even in luke uh chapter 24 at the
[2:07:31] ascension notice what happens with jesus
[2:07:34] it says in luke chapter 24
[2:07:36] and verse 15 he led them out as far as
[2:07:38] to bethany and he lifted up his hands
[2:07:42] and he blessed them and it came to pass
[2:07:44] while he blessed them
[2:07:46] he was harpazo
[2:07:50] he was snatched he was
[2:07:53] parted for them and carried in fact it's
[2:07:55] the word carried
[2:07:57] he was carried up into heaven
[2:08:01] snatched away pulled away suddenly
[2:08:04] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[2:08:08] her pazzo physically
[2:08:12] not spiritually physically
[2:08:15] something happened
[2:08:20] something's going to happen one day to
[2:08:23] the whole entire world
[2:08:26] to the entire earth
[2:08:30] isaiah warns of this and isaiah begins
[2:08:33] to speak of a time
[2:08:35] where the bible says in isaiah if you
[2:08:37] want to put that up isaiah chapter 24
[2:08:40] i'm going to close here isaiah speaks
[2:08:43] about a time
[2:08:45] in isaiah chapter 24 verse 1 isaiah
[2:08:48] tells us in the last days he says behold
[2:08:50] the lord maketh the earth
[2:08:53] empty and maketh at waste
[2:08:56] and turneth it upside down
[2:09:00] and scattereth abroad the inhabitants
[2:09:04] thereof he's going to you think they
[2:09:06] think
[2:09:07] that covet has turned the world upside
[2:09:10] down they have not
[2:09:11] seen nothing yet
[2:09:14] when the lord isaiah says on that day
[2:09:17] the day of the
[2:09:18] lord the day of the lord
[2:09:22] when it's the lord's day you had a day
[2:09:25] of the tank
[2:09:26] you had the day of the military the day
[2:09:28] of the air force
[2:09:29] and unless you had air force you you
[2:09:31] didn't stand a chance
[2:09:33] you had the day of the chariot and you
[2:09:35] unless you had a chair you had the day
[2:09:36] of the
[2:09:36] calvary and then there matured and it
[2:09:38] was the day of the
[2:09:40] military army well guess what there's a
[2:09:41] day of the lord
[2:09:44] and unless you've got the lord your
[2:09:47] tanks and your planes and your nuke
[2:09:49] bombs won't do nothing to defend you
[2:09:52] he'll turn it upside down isaiah says
[2:09:55] what a what an illustration
[2:09:57] he turneth the world judgment that's
[2:10:01] belching waiting his brother branham
[2:10:02] says what are we seeing today you say
[2:10:04] brother matt what do you believe covet
[2:10:05] is pre-tribulation signs
[2:10:08] as we read here before from a brother
[2:10:10] from africa who wrote that
[2:10:11] poem a dress rehearsal
[2:10:15] they think this is bad it's only going
[2:10:17] to get worse
[2:10:19] it's only going to get so bad until the
[2:10:20] world is turned completely upside down
[2:10:23] and in a single hour the bible says
[2:10:26] judgment's coming upon the earth and in
[2:10:28] one hour
[2:10:30] within just a short span of time
[2:10:33] the whole world will witness destruction
[2:10:37] upon not just a city not just upon a
[2:10:40] nation
[2:10:40] but the entire world
[2:10:44] john gives us this in revelation in
[2:10:46] revelations 18 verse 8
[2:10:49] he says in one day death and mourning
[2:10:52] revelations 18 8 and one day death and
[2:10:55] mourning
[2:10:56] and famine and she shall be utterly
[2:10:58] burned with fire for strong as the lord
[2:11:00] god who judgeth her for in one
[2:11:04] hour verse 17 for in one hour
[2:11:08] notice this so great riches
[2:11:11] is come to nothing
[2:11:14] one hour the vatican will be destroyed
[2:11:20] in one hour just 60 minutes
[2:11:25] in one hour it says so great riches has
[2:11:28] come tonight and every shipmaster and
[2:11:30] all the company and ships and sailors
[2:11:31] and as many as trade by the st
[2:11:34] stood afar off keep going
[2:11:38] and cried when they saw the smoke of a
[2:11:39] burning saying what city is like unto
[2:11:42] this great city isaiah begins to
[2:11:46] prophesy this and says
[2:11:47] every house is shut up it says the city
[2:11:50] in isaiah 24
[2:11:51] 10 the city of confusion is broken down
[2:11:54] every house is shut up so that no man
[2:11:56] may come in
[2:11:57] the entire world will be left desolate
[2:12:01] upside down the city is left in
[2:12:02] desolation and the gate is smitten with
[2:12:04] destruction
[2:12:07] in just a moment everything
[2:12:10] will change everything will change
[2:12:16] we think covet has changed things
[2:12:19] there's come in a day that's going to
[2:12:21] permanently change everything
[2:12:24] suddenly suddenly cataclysmic
[2:12:28] destruction on a scale never before seen
[2:12:33] what will it be for the matter to be the
[2:12:35] strike of god's judgment his final
[2:12:37] cup of wrath that is poured out
[2:12:40] the bible says the earth will begin to
[2:12:42] reel within itself
[2:12:44] and isaiah says there will be nowhere
[2:12:46] for man to escape
[2:12:48] he says in isaiah 24 verse 6
[2:12:51] it says the lofty proud city
[2:12:54] he layeth it lo my he says and that they
[2:12:58] that dwell there and are desolate
[2:12:59] therefore the inhabitants of the earth
[2:13:00] are burned and few men
[2:13:02] left the lofty verse 5
[2:13:05] the the 26 chapter 26 sorry
[2:13:09] chapter 26 isaiah 26 5 the lofty proud
[2:13:12] city he layeth it low
[2:13:14] even to the ground he bringeth it

[2:28:40] moment that you're he's
