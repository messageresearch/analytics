[36:02] it's not far away we don't we think
[36:06] about it we read about it we hear about
[36:09] it but until that day when were there
[36:12] real then we're gonna know what it's
[36:13] gonna be but I think his brother branham
[36:16] said after he came from that time beyond
[36:19] the curtain of timon and he said can't
[36:21] explain it but don't miss it
[36:23] that was the best so we have a couple of
[36:26] prayer requests to bring to your
[36:28] attention and then submit praises and a
[36:33] couple announcements that we heard
[36:37] through a sister that attends a Spanish
[36:39] Tabernacle with Isaac Noriega and Golden
[36:43] Dawn that sister Lucy is brother Isaac's
[36:46] wife has been in the hospital for
[36:48] several weeks she's had some serious
[36:51] heart problems and has been sick for
[36:54] some time and the word that was
[36:56] announced was they don't know that she's
[36:59] going to make it she is she's she's
[37:01] close to death so a lot of loved ones a
[37:05] lot of friends a lot of the family of
[37:06] folks that we've known for years and
[37:09] people children daughters sons brother
[37:15] Isaac and all them they would it would
[37:16] be a hard hard loss so we just keep them
[37:20] in prayer and also I have put on my
[37:24] notes to remember bread they had do
[37:26] going he he came today and got a chance
[37:28] to talk with him the surgery went well
[37:30] and that was just some recovery recovery
[37:33] from on the right wrist surgery so we'll
[37:36] keep him in prayer in it as we talked to
[37:39] the Lord you know the needs and you know
[37:41] what what's on your heart so as we talk
[37:44] to them don't talk to them as a god that
[37:47] you have to plead and beg to but one
[37:48] who's your friend when you could share
[37:50] so let's stand wherever we are maybe at
[37:53] home those are
[37:55] able to be here today and let's just
[37:58] talk to the Lord we come to you in that
[37:59] precious name the only name in which we
[38:03] can approach you we cannot approach you
[38:04] through our own name through our own
[38:06] merits the name of our pastor the name
[38:10] of our prophet no lore we approach you
[38:12] in the one name the name of the Lord
[38:14] Jesus Christ
[38:15] every demon trembles every knee shall
[38:18] bow to that precious name Lord and we
[38:21] come to you Lord you know the needs and
[38:23] our sister Lucy Lord sister Lucy Noriega
[38:25] Lord the report was she was in the
[38:27] hospital not doing well but Lord you're
[38:30] the great physician the doctor of
[38:33] doctors the heart specialist whatever
[38:35] the need is Lord you know what is their
[38:38] Lord in Lord may the faith of your
[38:40] children rise up and take hold of your
[38:42] promise and claim it not good to see
[38:45] brother head here Lord just asking you a
[38:47] complete restoration of health therefore
[38:49] his right wrist Lord and thank you for
[38:51] the surgery going well or to appreciate
[38:53] every heart every hand maybe in in their
[38:56] homes today wherever they might be with
[38:58] their hands raised Lord saying Lord
[39:01] remember me Lord in this hour we're
[39:03] looking to you Lord and we thank you for
[39:06] in the precious name of our Lord and
[39:08] Savior Jesus Christ amen you may be
[39:12] seated
[39:14] just a few things to bring to your
[39:18] attention let's see for the Matthew
[39:24] McFadden was the leading song service
[39:26] and today's his birthday so god bless
[39:29] brother Matthew and
[39:32] I know there's been quite a few
[39:37] birthdays this past week from different
[39:39] parts of the family we celebrated my
[39:41] daughter Abby's yesterday and I know the
[39:44] Carey celebrated quite a few birthdays
[39:46] in the last few days and but one of
[39:50] these days we'll be young forever so
[39:54] brother Graham said somewhere between 19
[39:57] and 21 so that's kind of a memory for
[40:00] some of us now but it'll be it'll be
[40:03] wonderful so also we'd like to
[40:06] congratulate those that have graduated
[40:08] there have been some graduations
[40:09] recently and I know this year it's been
[40:11] different than normal where somewhere
[40:15] had to do virtual graduations all but to
[40:18] those who have graduated from whatever
[40:20] whatever schooling you graduated god
[40:23] bless you and and congratulations so
[40:26] appreciate that and then we know some of
[40:29] the churches have opened up started here
[40:33] in Arizona and other states also and
[40:37] some churches stayed open during the
[40:39] during this whole time and I had a
[40:42] pastor call me I'm one of a small church
[40:46] and he said what do you think I should
[40:47] do I said I can't tell you what to do
[40:50] you're the pastor I just told him this I
[40:54] said as the pastor if all goes well
[40:56] you'll get the credit and if all goes
[40:59] bad you'll get the blame so you have to
[41:02] deal with both sides of it so as those
[41:05] that chose to keep the their church is
[41:07] open god bless them those that chose to
[41:09] run it the way they did God bless them
[41:11] also so we we had a I guess you'd call a
[41:16] meeting through whatsapp a little bit
[41:18] yesterday with brother Matt and he did
[41:20] for those of you who have whatsapp you
[41:23] probably seen the announcement but those
[41:29] that you may have not heard I'll just
[41:30] read to you what brother Matt wrote here
[41:32] he says God bless you Saints I want to
[41:35] let you know that we will be making a
[41:36] church wider announcement on behalf of
[41:39] myself and the church officers
[41:41] concerning when and how we will be
[41:43] resuming regular gatherings at church in
[41:45] the very
[41:46] future we are aware that the state of
[41:48] Arizona is reopening but for tomorrow
[41:50] and next Wednesday we will continue the
[41:53] format we have been using with a minimal
[41:55] crew and live streaming phone hookup and
[41:57] then says please look for upcoming
[41:59] announcements now brother Matt is doing
[42:02] his best to be here next Sunday and at
[42:06] that point I'm not going to put words in
[42:09] his mouth and say we are going to be
[42:10] open we're not going to be open but Lord
[42:13] willing it'll be very soon and as we've
[42:16] talked to different folks and brother
[42:19] Matt said it's good to see some folks
[42:20] here today that that have we haven't
[42:23] seen and for those of you that are at
[42:25] home and wanted to be here the church is
[42:27] not full it's just a couple people okay
[42:29] don't don't feel too bad but we are
[42:32] looking forward to seeing all of you it
[42:34] is something we have missed something
[42:36] that is part of the family god I'd like
[42:38] to read something for you to you I was
[42:41] reading the message lean not to your
[42:44] understanding and brother Branham says
[42:46] this is on paragraph 45 and he's
[42:48] speaking of of those who had accepted
[42:51] the Lord and God did something wonderful
[42:54] to them but they chose by their own
[42:56] understanding to go a different way to
[42:59] join a different group or or somebody
[43:01] that had a bigger church and and he's
[43:03] not condemning them but this is what he
[43:05] said about you while you're the best
[43:08] class that there is sons and daughters
[43:11] of God well I like that company better
[43:14] than I would with all the kings and
[43:16] potentates and everything else give me
[43:18] that humble bunch of people if they
[43:20] don't know their right hand from their
[43:22] left as long as they know God and love
[43:25] him and serve Him that's the celebrity
[43:28] of heaven to me yes sir so you might you
[43:32] might say well I'm not a whole lot but
[43:34] in God's eyes you're part of part of the
[43:36] celebrity of heaven and I thought I
[43:38] would share that with you today and just
[43:40] say it'll be good to get together and to
[43:43] worship the Lord God bless

[1:02:27] are just looking amen to what the Lord
[1:02:29] has for us today there's a great
[1:02:31] expectation upon my heart and I just
[1:02:33] want to be yielded to the Holy Spirit
[1:02:36] and I believe he'll speak to you today
[1:02:38] no matter where you're at no matter your

[1:02:48] our stability that is our hope amen we
[1:02:51] are not without hope we have hope today
[1:02:54] amen and so let's look at our at the
[1:02:56] word today and then if you have your
[1:02:58] Bible we'll turn to the Book of Ruth and
[1:03:01] I would like to just have you turn there
[1:03:02] to Ruth chapter 1 and we'll just start
[1:03:04] at the very first verse I'd like to
[1:03:06] continue on from where we were two
[1:03:08] Sundays ago on the unstoppable purpose
[1:03:12] of God
[1:03:12] I'd like to preach a part two of that
[1:03:14] today and we're going to see more of
[1:03:17] this unstoppable purpose we're gonna
[1:03:19] look at the purpose of God in the life
[1:03:21] of a Moabite woman and her mother-in-law
[1:03:24] now I don't have time today and just in
[1:03:28] one service to cover all that's in this
[1:03:31] book and all of the details and all of
[1:03:33] the story you can go home and read it
[1:03:35] for yourself and it's just a wonderful
[1:03:38] book that I believe the Lord has so many
[1:03:41] different things we could say about it
[1:03:43] but we just want to key in on just a few
[1:03:46] portions of the story of Ruth we're
[1:03:49] gonna start with the situation that
[1:03:52] starts with Naomi a mother-in-law and a
[1:03:55] limo lek leaving the land of Bethlehem
[1:03:58] Judea
[1:03:59] so we're preaching today on the
[1:04:00] unstoppable purpose part - and brother
[1:04:03] Jordan has a PowerPoint for the Jeremy
[1:04:05] there if it displays good that would be
[1:04:07] wonderful we have a few quick take
[1:04:09] quotations we would like to
[1:04:10] read and then we're looking forward to
[1:04:12] the day we could meet together and and
[1:04:15] everyone would meet not just in their
[1:04:17] homes we've appreciated this time and
[1:04:19] I'm glad we have stability in the midst
[1:04:21] of an unstable word a world we have a
[1:04:23] stable word Amen it's our security it's
[1:04:26] our anchor and it holds and I'm grateful
[1:04:29] for that but we're looking forward to
[1:04:31] the time when we could be together again
[1:04:32] Lord willin that will be next weekend
[1:04:35] I'll be there in person and not just in
[1:04:37] a virtual studio and so if the Lord
[1:04:40] would lead that's what we're gonna be
[1:04:42] there this coming weekend and more
[1:04:43] announcements to come on on what type of
[1:04:45] gathering we'll have so just look for
[1:04:47] that as we announced last night in the
[1:04:50] coming days but for now we just believe
[1:04:52] that this is the Lord's Day
[1:04:54] amen it's Sunday and the Sun is risen
[1:04:56] and we we have the proof of that we have
[1:04:59] the fruits of that in our own life amen
[1:05:02] and the the risen Savior has changed
[1:05:05] everything about us and we're grateful
[1:05:06] for that we'd like to look here today in
[1:05:09] Ruth chapter 1 and if you just want to
[1:05:11] begin reading here we'll begin reading
[1:05:13] just at the first verse Ruth chapter 1
[1:05:16] verse 1 it says now it came to pass in
[1:05:19] the days when the judges ruled that
[1:05:22] there was a famine in the land and a
[1:05:25] certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to
[1:05:27] sojourn in the country of Moab he and
[1:05:30] his wife his sons in the name of the men
[1:05:35] of the man was a limo lek in the name of
[1:05:37] his wife Naomi and the name of his two
[1:05:40] sons may Alon and chilly on verse 3 and
[1:05:42] Elimelech Naomi's husband died and she
[1:05:45] was left and her two sons and they took
[1:05:49] them wives of the women of Moab the name
[1:05:52] of the one was Orpah and the name of the
[1:05:54] other Ruth and they dwelled there about
[1:05:58] 10 years and may Ilan and chilly undyed
[1:06:02] also both of them left of her two sons
[1:06:05] and her husband then she arose with her
[1:06:09] daughters-in-law that she might return
[1:06:11] from the country of Moab for she had
[1:06:14] heard in the country of Moab how the
[1:06:15] Lord had visited his people and giving
[1:06:18] them bread wherefore she went forth out
[1:06:20] of the place where she was and her two
[1:06:23] daughters-in-law
[1:06:24] and they went on the way to return into
[1:06:27] the land of juda verse eight and Naomi
[1:06:31] said unto her two daughters-in-law go
[1:06:33] return each to her mother's house and
[1:06:36] the Lord deal kindly with you as you
[1:06:38] have dealt with the dead and with me
[1:06:40] Lord grant you that you may find rest
[1:06:42] each of you in the house of her husband
[1:06:45] then she kissed them and they lifted up
[1:06:48] their voice and wept what sorrow what a
[1:06:52] confusion it was almost impossible to
[1:06:56] find the purpose of God in this story
[1:06:59] but let's look a little further verse 10
[1:07:02] and they said unto her Cheryl surely we
[1:07:04] will return with the unto thy people and
[1:07:08] Naomi said turn again my daughters why
[1:07:11] will you go with me are there yet any
[1:07:14] more sons in my womb that they may be
[1:07:16] your husband's turn again my daughters
[1:07:19] go your way for I am too old to have a
[1:07:21] husband if I should say I have hope if I
[1:07:24] should have a husband also tonight and
[1:07:26] should also bear sons would you tarry
[1:07:28] for them till they were grown would you
[1:07:30] stay for them from having husbands name
[1:07:32] my daughters for agree with me much for
[1:07:34] your sakes at the hand of the Lord is
[1:07:35] going out against me they lifted up
[1:07:37] their voice and wept again a Norbit
[1:07:39] kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave
[1:07:42] unto her very big difference there and
[1:07:44] she said behold thy sister-in-law was
[1:07:48] going back unto her people and unto her
[1:07:50] God's return thou after thy
[1:07:53] sister-in-law and Ruth said treat me not
[1:07:56] to leave thee or to return from
[1:07:59] following after thee for whether thou
[1:08:02] goest I will go and where thou lodgest I
[1:08:07] will Lodge thy people shall be my people
[1:08:10] and my god and thy God my God where
[1:08:15] they'll Dyess will I die and there will
[1:08:18] I be buried the Lord do so to me and
[1:08:21] more also if all but death part thee and
[1:08:25] me when she saw that she was steadfastly
[1:08:29] minded to go with her then she left
[1:08:32] speaking unto her so they too went unto
[1:08:35] so they too went until they came to Beth
[1:08:38] ham and it came to pass when they were
[1:08:40] come to Bethlehem that all the city was
[1:08:42] moved about them and they said is this
[1:08:44] Naomi and she said unto them call me not
[1:08:47] notice this here here's her spirit this
[1:08:49] is a barometer this is a woman who's
[1:08:52] lost her husband lost her sons and she
[1:08:55] comes and they said is this Naomi and
[1:08:57] she said to them call me not Naomi call
[1:09:00] me Mara for the almighty hath dealt very
[1:09:03] bitterly that word Mara even the name
[1:09:06] she gives means bitterness the Lord hath
[1:09:09] dealt very bitterly with me I went out
[1:09:12] notice this I went out full and the Lord
[1:09:15] hath brought me home again empty why
[1:09:19] then call you mémé Naomi seeing the Lord
[1:09:21] had testified against me and the
[1:09:23] almighty hath afflicted me so Naomi
[1:09:25] returned and ruth the moabite us our
[1:09:29] daughter-in-law with her which returned
[1:09:31] out of the country of Moab and they came
[1:09:33] to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley
[1:09:36] harvest let's just pray by your heads
[1:09:38] here with me there at the tabernacle and
[1:09:40] there at home Lord Jesus father we look
[1:09:43] to your word today God for truly it's
[1:09:46] our answer it is a refuge Lord it is our
[1:09:49] hope Lord it's upon where we put our
[1:09:51] feet where we place our home where we
[1:09:53] build our family where we plan our life
[1:09:55] where we put it all of our trust Lord
[1:09:57] it's in your word God it is our all in
[1:10:00] all Lord we look to it today God we pray
[1:10:02] father you would come by your spirit
[1:10:04] your word Lord it's already anointed but
[1:10:07] God may as I raise my hands Lord and
[1:10:09] those at home those in the church raise
[1:10:11] their hands may you anoint your people
[1:10:14] now Lord not just to hear the word not
[1:10:16] just to speak the word but father - to
[1:10:19] come into communion and fellowship and
[1:10:21] worship with you right now
[1:10:23] believing Lord that you're in control of
[1:10:25] all things we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[1:10:28] name Amen amen you can be seated seated
[1:10:33] by the Jordan let me know if there's an
[1:10:35] audio delay at all I can fix that on my
[1:10:37] end amen we would like to look here at
[1:10:39] this story of God's unstoppable purpose
[1:10:43] as we said there's so many things in the
[1:10:46] life of Ruth and her story is going to
[1:10:50] we know have a great
[1:10:51] heart in the redemption story but we
[1:10:54] just want to zoom in here just for a
[1:10:56] moment as we continue God's unstoppable
[1:10:58] purpose and I'd like to this take some
[1:11:00] lessons because I believe there's so
[1:11:02] many that that we could learn from this
[1:11:05] story of Ruth starts out so confusing
[1:11:09] such tragedy even the very words that it
[1:11:13] starts out with drew snapped er one
[1:11:15] starts by telling us there was a famine
[1:11:19] in the land
[1:11:20] I believe it's represented above the day
[1:11:22] and age that you and I live in that
[1:11:25] there are there's a famine a great
[1:11:27] spiritual famine in the land churches
[1:11:31] don't know where to turn denominations
[1:11:33] don't have answers great preachers with
[1:11:36] great auditoriums filled with thousands
[1:11:38] of people there's a spiritual famine for
[1:11:42] the real hungry souls who are really
[1:11:44] looking for Christ and I believe this
[1:11:47] was the time that Ruth was living in and
[1:11:49] the buyer Naomi the Bible says that
[1:11:51] there was a great famine in the land and
[1:11:54] the land that it's speaking of is
[1:11:56] Bethlehem Judea this was the promised
[1:12:00] land that were fill meaning house of God
[1:12:04] and then the word Bethlehem Judea means
[1:12:07] the house of bread the house of blessing
[1:12:10] the house of love of resource this is
[1:12:15] what it means they left the land of
[1:12:17] blessing we know it was Bethlehem Judea
[1:12:20] and Judah means praise so they leave the
[1:12:23] land of blessing they leave the land of
[1:12:25] praise and they go to Moab ulema lek
[1:12:28] being the father the leader the husband
[1:12:31] he makes a choice under pressure no
[1:12:34] doubt there was great pressure because
[1:12:35] there was a great famine in the land but
[1:12:38] how did the famine come this famine in
[1:12:41] Bethlehem Judea was not the cruelty of
[1:12:43] God it was not the punishment of it was
[1:12:46] not the cruelty of God just being cruel
[1:12:48] or just bad chance but but the story
[1:12:52] that we find in Israel is that they had
[1:12:54] been so backslidden that they had turned
[1:12:57] from God for so many years and God had
[1:12:59] sent him prophet after prophet trying to
[1:13:02] woo them back to himself but we know
[1:13:05] that
[1:13:05] they they were they were sinful they
[1:13:07] were lustful they were idolatrous and so
[1:13:10] God before he takes them out of the land
[1:13:12] he starts to send them different curses
[1:13:16] and those curses would start with
[1:13:18] sickness then it would go to and their
[1:13:20] animals and their animals would die and
[1:13:22] plagues would come and they would lose
[1:13:24] their harvest and their harvest would
[1:13:25] fail and scorching Sun would come and
[1:13:28] God would stop the rain and the supply
[1:13:30] of water and but you said brother Matt
[1:13:33] why is that important because it's
[1:13:34] important so important to understand
[1:13:37] that ulema lek could interpret this any
[1:13:41] way he wanted as you and I no matter
[1:13:43] what trial we find ourselves in no
[1:13:46] matter what difficulty comes our way no
[1:13:48] matter what problem or circumstance we
[1:13:50] face we can sometimes if we're not
[1:13:52] careful we can start to interpret the
[1:13:55] voice of that trial as some cruelty or
[1:13:58] just some bad luck but my brother my
[1:14:01] sister this was God trying to get the
[1:14:04] attention of his family unfortunately a
[1:14:08] little light translates it and
[1:14:09] interprets it wrong and under pressure
[1:14:12] no doubt pressure they were under
[1:14:15] immense pressure uh there was a great
[1:14:18] famine in Bethlehem Judea I couldn't
[1:14:20] imagine what it would be like to live
[1:14:22] there and and to live under such hard
[1:14:26] times and such shortage of food and even
[1:14:29] their two children melon and chili on
[1:14:31] these boys were not born in Moab they
[1:14:35] weren't Moabites they were Israelites
[1:14:37] they were born in Bethlehem Judea but
[1:14:40] just as an indication about how bad the
[1:14:42] famine was look at the meaning of their
[1:14:45] name when Naomi and a lemon lack names
[1:14:47] these sons they named the mail on which
[1:14:50] means sick or dying and then chili on
[1:14:54] which means pining or wasting away this
[1:14:58] tells you an indication of how bad the
[1:15:01] famine was that was so bad that they
[1:15:04] were wasting away but you say by the man
[1:15:06] that should have give them license to
[1:15:07] leave let me tell you something brother
[1:15:09] no matter how you naturally feel no
[1:15:12] matter how bad your natural life shifts
[1:15:15] or turns out to be it is
[1:15:18] the right choice to leave the land of
[1:15:21] promise no matter what your emotion
[1:15:24] tells you no matter what your what your
[1:15:26] mind is telling you those are all lyin
[1:15:28] vanities God may be bringing famine in
[1:15:31] your life too
[1:15:35] maybe that trials there for a purpose to
[1:15:37] try to bring something greater from your
[1:15:40] life that God knows he can bring you to
[1:15:42] it is not the time when it's up when
[1:15:44] there's when there's a feeling of
[1:15:46] drought or famine or coldness is not the
[1:15:50] time to leave Bethlehem Judah and go to
[1:15:53] Moab but a little knack unfortunately
[1:15:57] the Bible says leaves this land of
[1:16:01] Bethlehem Judah and he leaves it's going
[1:16:04] to soldier in the land of Moab Moab you
[1:16:08] say what is Moab Moab is going to
[1:16:12] represent it's a place of idolatry this
[1:16:14] was not this was an anti-jewish nation
[1:16:18] they hated the Jews
[1:16:19] this wasn't a people for God this was
[1:16:22] representative of the lustful sinful
[1:16:24] world Moab where Moab was even who was
[1:16:27] Moab we know in the Bible the Moab was
[1:16:29] the ancestral of productt he was up he
[1:16:32] was he was from the incestual affair
[1:16:34] between lot and one of his daughters and
[1:16:37] brother Adam said what did Moab
[1:16:39] represent it represents the flesh it
[1:16:41] represents our sinful nature it
[1:16:44] represents lust it represents the
[1:16:46] congregation of the wicked David would
[1:16:49] seat of the scornful this was this was
[1:16:52] the this was the land of the wicked but
[1:16:55] because of pressure because of
[1:16:57] circumstance a limit like makes a choice
[1:17:01] now he had no intention of turning his
[1:17:03] back on God he why I'm not you know we
[1:17:06] got to be careful how we how we paint a
[1:17:08] limo like here he wasn't a sinner he
[1:17:10] wasn't just looking for lustful things
[1:17:12] he was in a famine and he was looking
[1:17:14] for answers and my brother my sister if
[1:17:16] we're not careful sometimes and
[1:17:18] difficulties we start to push panic
[1:17:20] buttons we started and maybe we don't do
[1:17:23] anything naturally anything substitute
[1:17:25] Lee but even in our own spirit and own
[1:17:27] mind we begin unsettled we get unnerved
[1:17:29] we start looking to different things and
[1:17:32] starting to look into temporary
[1:17:33] satisfactions and this was the case of a
[1:17:35] Lim Allah he was under pressure and so
[1:17:38] he decides he's gonna leave the land of
[1:17:40] Bethlehem Judea and because of that
[1:17:43] pressure he's going to go into Moab just
[1:17:45] to sow
[1:17:45] the Bible says he's just gonna soldier
[1:17:47] him which means temporary is he I'm just
[1:17:49] gonna go there just for a little while
[1:17:50] I'm gonna check out of my current
[1:17:52] problem the grass is greener on the
[1:17:53] other side of the fence and so I'm gonna
[1:17:55] go to the to the land of Moab I'm gonna
[1:17:58] take my wife I'm gonna take my children
[1:17:59] my boys you know he never intended the
[1:18:04] consequences that would follow but he
[1:18:07] makes a choice to leave and he goes into
[1:18:10] a land called Moab that even the very
[1:18:13] name the definition of Moab means
[1:18:15] fornication think about that just for a
[1:18:18] moment here
[1:18:18] he goes into Moab and and this was this
[1:18:22] Moab was the same one who seduced Israel
[1:18:25] and and they lose in the wind and
[1:18:28] him in the wilderness and they lose
[1:18:31] 24,000 people from a plague live alike
[1:18:34] knew this history he knew he had no
[1:18:36] association he knew he should have never
[1:18:38] yoked himself up he knew it he knew he
[1:18:41] should have never lived there he should
[1:18:42] have never dwelled there he shouldn't
[1:18:43] have even a visited there brother we
[1:18:46] don't visit sinful places we don't even
[1:18:49] we don't even do it for a temporary stay
[1:18:51] we don't have a temporary sin in our
[1:18:53] life be and just check out from from our
[1:18:57] life of holy living just to dabble in
[1:19:00] sin just a little bit you know you play
[1:19:02] with fire you're gonna get burned and
[1:19:04] I'm preaching this for somebody here
[1:19:05] today
[1:19:06] you play with fire and play with the
[1:19:08] wrong things that there's eventually
[1:19:09] there's consequences to every seed you
[1:19:12] sow whether it's a seed of God that you
[1:19:15] sow and you reap a good hardness or you
[1:19:18] sow a seed of discrepancy you'll reap
[1:19:20] what you sow the jeremiah says you sow
[1:19:24] to the wind and now you reap the
[1:19:26] whirlwind and boy did eliminate
[1:19:28] Elimelech reap the whirlwind god forbade
[1:19:32] them to marry Moabites why say for the
[1:19:37] men why because the Bible says what
[1:19:38] fellowship does light have with darkness
[1:19:40] what what fellowship you go into a
[1:19:43] relationship I don't care if it's a
[1:19:45] business relationship to where you turn
[1:19:47] it turns into a friendship and then
[1:19:49] there's a social gather and then there's
[1:19:50] the social set in the social East my
[1:19:53] brother my sister were to be separate to
[1:19:55] be separated for God set
[1:19:57] for His purposes what fellowship does
[1:20:00] light have with darkness
[1:20:02] the Bible says get bad company corrupts
[1:20:04] good character it'll always happen no
[1:20:09] matter how innocent it seems you're to
[1:20:11] be suffered we're in the world but not
[1:20:13] of the word you say brother Matt does
[1:20:15] that mean we don't have business
[1:20:16] dealings with unbelievers no that's not
[1:20:18] what I'm saying here today but you don't
[1:20:19] enter into a relationship into some
[1:20:21] place to where it becomes a that person
[1:20:24] has control or influence over you you
[1:20:27] just go read what brother Branham said
[1:20:28] about that making a league with an
[1:20:30] unbeliever now listen
[1:20:35] god forbade them to marry MOBOT women
[1:20:38] see says in and you can read it in the
[1:20:40] book of first Kings God says he says you
[1:20:43] yeah I'm gonna forbid you to marry them
[1:20:45] and you said with Matt why God gives
[1:20:47] them the purpose he says for surely they
[1:20:50] will turn away your hearts after their
[1:20:54] gods and this is exactly what we do oh
[1:20:57] we that we fellowship with the wrong
[1:21:00] things now just stay with me here's
[1:21:02] we're getting somewhere here today it
[1:21:04] begins to turn and I'm afraid today
[1:21:05] whenever there's a famine God's people
[1:21:08] can turn to the world themselves to
[1:21:11] seducing spirits and idolatry and mixing
[1:21:15] what's holy and what's unholy and what's
[1:21:16] godly and what's ungodly oh but but but
[1:21:20] today let me tell you don't leave your
[1:21:22] place of blessing I don't care how bad
[1:21:24] your circumstances are I don't care how
[1:21:27] bad the situation is
[1:21:29] don't leave Bethlehem Judea no matter
[1:21:33] what you face today stay in your land of
[1:21:35] promise even if you don't feel anointed
[1:21:38] if you feel cold
[1:21:39] if you feel distant if you feel
[1:21:41] disconnected if you feel I don't care if
[1:21:44] you felt like a failure I don't care if
[1:21:46] you no matter what emotion you feel
[1:21:48] today stay in the promised land for
[1:21:51] there's no life outside of it as Naomi
[1:21:55] learned she loses her husband she loses
[1:22:00] her son's young men men who she loved
[1:22:05] oh what a lesson here we find from this
[1:22:09] story but it was no accident that this
[1:22:12] happens to sister Naomi even though she
[1:22:15] doesn't realize it it was a terrible
[1:22:17] decision for a limit like to make but
[1:22:19] God was in control God had a purpose in
[1:22:22] everything he takes his family out of
[1:22:24] God's promised land and the house of
[1:22:26] bread and he takes them into this land
[1:22:28] of Moab under pressure he makes this
[1:22:30] decision and and and but but you know
[1:22:33] what my brother and my sister that
[1:22:35] famine was the tender loving hand of
[1:22:37] Jehovah I came back to this just here
[1:22:40] for a moment because I don't I want to
[1:22:41] make sure don't miss it
[1:22:42] don't ever interpret your trial don't
[1:22:45] ever interpret your hardship
[1:22:46] don't let the dead
[1:22:47] we'll reinterpret that situation I don't
[1:22:50] care how dark and how purposeless your
[1:22:53] life seems don't ever let the devil lie
[1:22:57] to you and tell you it's anything
[1:22:59] outside of the tender loving hand of
[1:23:02] Jehovah who sees the end from the
[1:23:06] beginning and you don't and I don't and
[1:23:08] we don't understand everything we'll get
[1:23:12] to that more here just in a moment but
[1:23:15] now everyone's running to Moab and
[1:23:17] everyone's hungry there in famine he
[1:23:20] leaves there a limit like leaves this
[1:23:22] house of bread as we said and he makes a
[1:23:25] conscious decision I'm just gonna go and
[1:23:27] dwell just temporarily but what he
[1:23:31] doesn't realize is that in fact what
[1:23:33] he's doing is he's abandoning his
[1:23:35] blessing as the Bible says in Isaiah you
[1:23:37] forsaken your own mercy you're forsaking
[1:23:40] your own mercy he abandons the land of
[1:23:43] Moab at the land of Bethlehem Judea he
[1:23:46] leaves the blend of blessing the land of
[1:23:48] praise for a land of idolatry and sinful
[1:23:51] lust notice this here and and and you
[1:23:55] look at this here notice his heart as
[1:23:59] you consider this passage you can see
[1:24:01] the situation little X in we find in
[1:24:03] verse 1 that it says that he planned to
[1:24:06] sojourn that means a temporary dwelling
[1:24:09] it's a temporary state it's a temporary
[1:24:12] existence oh I'm just gonna go there I'm
[1:24:16] just going to jitters be temporary
[1:24:18] you're not trusting God you're trusting
[1:24:20] the arm of flesh it'll always lead you
[1:24:22] down the wrong road it's gonna be
[1:24:24] temporary I'm just gonna go there for a
[1:24:26] while I plan on going back to Bethlehem
[1:24:28] I don't plan on living there forever you
[1:24:30] know many people today you could find
[1:24:34] yourself in that same exact spot as he
[1:24:38] was in with a genuine desire to serve
[1:24:40] the Living God to live wholly for the
[1:24:42] Lord you really don't ever plan up get
[1:24:44] you don't ever plan on getting caught
[1:24:46] and getting addicted you don't ever plan
[1:24:48] on the situation going from bad to worst
[1:24:51] you don't ever plan on the little things
[1:24:53] becoming big things you never plan on
[1:24:55] that you never plan on getting lured in
[1:24:58] and stuck we never play
[1:25:01] that you know mid me that wonder even
[1:25:04] start to wonder from the Lord and and
[1:25:06] their own spirit and their own heart
[1:25:08] they begin to wander from the things of
[1:25:10] God they wonder away from the Fellowship
[1:25:12] of the Saints they wonder away from his
[1:25:14] word they wonder away from the voice of
[1:25:15] the Prophet they wonder and they wonder
[1:25:17] into all kinds of different temporary
[1:25:20] pleasure and some of those things are
[1:25:23] not necessarily sinful hear me sometimes
[1:25:26] those things aren't necessarily simple I
[1:25:28] know I could talk about being back
[1:25:29] slidden the Bible says even when doing
[1:25:31] when Jesus is speaking he says he says
[1:25:36] be sober I'd be ready to stand before
[1:25:39] the Son of Man don't be caught up in the
[1:25:41] cares of this life not the sins of this
[1:25:44] life the cares of this world even Jesus
[1:25:47] and the parable says that word becoming
[1:25:49] unfruitful the cares of this life
[1:25:50] choking the word sometimes it's not the
[1:25:53] sinful things that chokes the word out
[1:25:55] of our life sometimes it's just life and
[1:25:59] we get so stuck in the habits of life
[1:26:01] and we forget we're pilgrims or
[1:26:03] strangers many wonder they begin to
[1:26:07] wonder in their spirit but they don't
[1:26:08] have an intention desire to abandon the
[1:26:11] Lord all together you know this is a
[1:26:13] dangerous spot to be and I know I don't
[1:26:15] really plan on leaving forever I'm just
[1:26:17] you know just I just need a little bit
[1:26:18] of temporary peace a little bit of
[1:26:20] temporary satisfaction so I'm going to
[1:26:21] make this decision I know it's gonna
[1:26:22] take me out of the house of God you know
[1:26:24] and Wednesdays we're taking out of the
[1:26:26] house of God here I'm just gonna make
[1:26:27] this little choice and you know I'll
[1:26:28] come back it won't be that big of a deal
[1:26:30] Oh al Emelec did you really count the
[1:26:35] costs when you made that choice you know
[1:26:38] Satan will never show you the end result
[1:26:44] my father is famous for saying you know
[1:26:46] they'll show you the picture of the
[1:26:48] marble oh man with his cowboy hat
[1:26:50] handsome and young and full of life and
[1:26:52] his his blue jeans and he's got that
[1:26:54] Marv blow cigarette and all he looks
[1:26:56] just so like he's got everything what
[1:26:58] the devil will he'll show you that he'll
[1:27:00] never show you that man in a hospital
[1:27:02] bed gasping for his life with cancer
[1:27:05] I'll never show you the destruction of
[1:27:07] what that sin brings in your life it'll
[1:27:09] never show you
[1:27:10] broken home he'll never show you the
[1:27:12] broken marriage he'll never show you the
[1:27:14] the broken children he'll never show you
[1:27:16] the results of the consequences he only
[1:27:19] shows you the grass is greener on the
[1:27:20] other side of the fence your situations
[1:27:23] bad here what do you have to lose I
[1:27:26] never show you it'll only show you those
[1:27:29] things that appeal to your flesh now I'm
[1:27:32] afraid many are fallen to have fallen
[1:27:33] away not even serving the Lord today
[1:27:35] they didn't say they did but let me tell
[1:27:37] you this they're not in church today but
[1:27:39] they didn't set out to abandon the law
[1:27:41] they just set out to going to Moab for a
[1:27:42] little while then years later years
[1:27:46] later years and years and years of waste
[1:27:48] goes by they came into the country of
[1:27:52] Moab and the Bible says here's what it
[1:27:54] says in verse 2 and they came in the
[1:27:56] land of Moab and continued there here we
[1:28:00] find a totally different arrangement
[1:28:03] what started out to be temporary what
[1:28:06] became a desire to sojourn and developed
[1:28:09] into a dwelling place into a home in the
[1:28:12] land of Moab rather than a temporary
[1:28:14] place they now settle down and they get
[1:28:17] comfortable and as time went on you know
[1:28:20] that the thought of Bethlehem Judea you
[1:28:22] know and all that all the famine the
[1:28:24] time of all that it was so hard back
[1:28:26] there that's what they thought it was so
[1:28:28] hard back there now Moab they got food
[1:28:30] they got they got they got everything
[1:28:32] but they're really losing about to lose
[1:28:35] everything and that memory of Bethlehem
[1:28:37] Judea begins to fade from their minds
[1:28:40] begins just to settle down that voice
[1:28:43] begins to slow and and I hope you're
[1:28:45] getting the picture here today you can't
[1:28:48] just dabble in sin and expect that to
[1:28:51] please the flesh just for a season and
[1:28:54] then leave whenever you choose I'll just
[1:28:56] go out of it no my brother my sister the
[1:28:59] Bible says you take fire into your bosom
[1:29:01] you're permanently imprinted with it
[1:29:03] that's why jeez that's why the scripture
[1:29:05] says in the New Testament don't you know
[1:29:07] that he lays with that he that lays with
[1:29:08] the harlot is one there one day that did
[1:29:11] they take an imprint of in in themselves
[1:29:13] you take an imprint and sin and it can
[1:29:16] stay with you for the rest of your life
[1:29:18] Oh what begins as a
[1:29:22] temporary arrangement turns into an
[1:29:24] extended stay you know the statement all
[1:29:26] too well sin will take you farther than
[1:29:28] you ever wish to go
[1:29:30] it'll keep you longer than you ever
[1:29:32] intended to stay and it'll cost you more
[1:29:34] than you were willing to pay living in
[1:29:38] sin is never without consequence
[1:29:41] as we said there you notice these verses
[1:29:46] it's evident that Naomi has a repentant
[1:29:49] heart and and she realized that Moab had
[1:29:52] brought her nothing but defeat despair
[1:29:55] death she wants to return to Bethlehem
[1:29:58] and she begins to seek for restoration
[1:30:00] you know the story of her life as it
[1:30:02] goes oh it just begins to slip off into
[1:30:05] such chaos as we know that now the
[1:30:08] father dies a limb alike dies loses her
[1:30:12] husband she she loses she loses her her
[1:30:15] her sons and now she's joined to these
[1:30:19] daughter-in-laws who you know she she
[1:30:21] didn't know before but now now notice
[1:30:24] this here just here for a moment as a
[1:30:26] despite not place you noticed the story
[1:30:29] if you just back out of that here for a
[1:30:31] moment you said where the man is that
[1:30:32] what the book of rau don't know it's
[1:30:35] about so much more he said by the mount
[1:30:37] was the purpose of God how can you
[1:30:38] preach the gods as having purpose
[1:30:40] because God had a purpose in every
[1:30:41] single bit of that God had a purpose he
[1:30:44] was wanting to bring out of all of that
[1:30:46] death and all of that sorrow the story
[1:30:49] of Ruth you say brother Matt it means so
[1:30:51] little listen to what the Prophet says
[1:30:53] here I want you to listen close listen
[1:30:54] know what brother Branham says brother
[1:30:56] Jordan if you want to display that first
[1:30:57] slide he says this book of Ruth was one
[1:31:01] of the outstanding books that they
[1:31:03] accepted why it's just a love story
[1:31:06] oh why would the writers an ancient sage
[1:31:08] accept this book he says there's a
[1:31:09] there's a hidden revelation in it and in
[1:31:13] this hidden revelation you catch the
[1:31:15] real meaning it'll bring you real close
[1:31:17] to God and I pray my whole soul this
[1:31:19] morning that God will catch every heart
[1:31:22] so spellbound till he reveals himself
[1:31:25] just as what do you just what he is in
[1:31:28] the story what is to you how to accept
[1:31:31] him and once listen and when you once
[1:31:34] see it it's so simple you wonder how you
[1:31:37] ever went over the top of it but it can
[1:31:40] only be revealed by the Holy Spirit we
[1:31:45] know it's going to speak of this
[1:31:46] lukewarmness even even greater than that
[1:31:50] it's going to speak of this clear-cut
[1:31:52] decision that Ruth as they as they die
[1:31:55] and they they they they they the husband
[1:31:59] passes away the boys passes away and now
[1:32:02] you come to this spot in this story
[1:32:04] where naomi is so bitter and she's so
[1:32:07] empty and and and she just says oh I
[1:32:11] just I can't make sense of everything
[1:32:13] but just leave me go back and and you
[1:32:16] have nothing I have nothing to give you
[1:32:18] oh and and the Bible says that Orpah
[1:32:21] just kissed the face of the message some
[1:32:26] of the Matins you mean to say that I
[1:32:27] meant to say that she kissed the face of
[1:32:30] the message and she kissed it goodbye
[1:32:32] but there was something different in
[1:32:34] Ruth notice this story as we go just a
[1:32:37] little bit further here today
[1:32:39] Ruth you know Ruth being a pagan girl
[1:32:42] Moe - Marie's you know and then here's
[1:32:45] Naomi and and and here just ears boys we
[1:32:49] have all the characters in the story but
[1:32:51] now you come to this spot in the story
[1:32:53] where where where you find this and I
[1:32:57] just want to turn to it here today you
[1:33:01] find this so listen what brother Branham
[1:33:02] says here and that brother Jordan's you
[1:33:04] could display that next quote says Arba
[1:33:06] a type of the lukewarm church that once
[1:33:09] started a type of the church that won't
[1:33:12] go all the way she said that sounds
[1:33:14] pretty good
[1:33:15] so she kissed her mother-in-law and
[1:33:17] returned back again that's a type of the
[1:33:19] lukewarm believer who will believe Jesus
[1:33:21] to be the Christ and then turn around
[1:33:22] and go back to the things she'd come out
[1:33:24] of to the men that will take the way
[1:33:25] with the Lord's despise fuse and then
[1:33:27] turn around and go back like a dog to
[1:33:29] its vomit and a halt to its wallow as
[1:33:32] the Bible says now she returned back to
[1:33:35] her gods many times we return back to
[1:33:40] the gods of our beginning what a
[1:33:43] statement maybe we'd go I got eyes of
[1:33:46] lust
[1:33:46] the wrong thing will turn back to lustin
[1:33:48] again maybe we got idols of drinking
[1:33:50] idols of smoking idols of lying idols of
[1:33:53] stealing all kinds of idols and then
[1:33:54] profess and be baptized and then turn
[1:33:57] again what a sad thing you remember this
[1:34:00] now listen here you remember it never
[1:34:02] spoke her name no more she was
[1:34:06] excommunicated because of her decision
[1:34:09] it never spoke of her name no more
[1:34:13] she's excommunicated because of her
[1:34:15] decision imagine this here just for a
[1:34:17] moment as we look a little bit further
[1:34:19] oh he and brother brother Branham says
[1:34:21] hold can't hold the Bible next slide but
[1:34:24] because of popularity listen to this
[1:34:26] because of popularity will kiss the
[1:34:29] church kiss the message kiss Christ
[1:34:33] goodbye go back to where he was hollowed
[1:34:36] out of oppa lukewarm excommunicated you
[1:34:41] know that's exactly what Jesus said he
[1:34:42] said when persecution arises for the
[1:34:46] words sake immediately they are offended
[1:34:49] when he's speaking of that wayside
[1:34:50] ground I think it is said some seed
[1:34:53] falls on stony someone thorny someone
[1:34:54] wayside and he says that those that fall
[1:34:57] I think is on the wayside granny says
[1:34:59] those that hear the word anon with joy
[1:35:00] receiveth that he says but when
[1:35:02] persecution arises because the word
[1:35:04] because for the words sake they're
[1:35:07] offended you say brother Matt what is
[1:35:08] all these things that's been happening
[1:35:10] lately do you know what it's been doing
[1:35:11] it's been shaking the tree it's been
[1:35:14] shaking the church and let me tell you
[1:35:16] my brother no matter how you interpret
[1:35:18] it today it's been the tender loving
[1:35:19] hand of Jehovah no matter what's
[1:35:22] happening on the message no matter
[1:35:23] what's happening in the world today it's
[1:35:25] been the tender loving hand of Jehovah
[1:35:28] shaking to make believers away but
[1:35:30] securing the truth given
[1:35:34] Sherman's to the truth of today the
[1:35:37] elected bride of Jesus Christ brother
[1:35:41] Branham says kiss Christ goodbye
[1:35:43] lukewarm excommunicated think of this
[1:35:47] story here
[1:35:48] you could bring out so many types and
[1:35:51] here's Ruth who sticks to God sticks to
[1:35:54] sticks to the Word of God says I'll go
[1:35:56] where you go out or your people might be
[1:35:58] my people
[1:35:59] oh and and then and then she she comes
[1:36:01] to that place and she's gleaning the
[1:36:03] field of Boaz in that God seems to
[1:36:05] notice all these stories all the types
[1:36:07] of them and said of him in a hidden
[1:36:09] revelation even and then this book you
[1:36:11] know we with the it's a story with so
[1:36:13] many lessons and so many types of it
[1:36:15] that we can learn but we see the purpose
[1:36:17] of God the unstoppable purpose from
[1:36:20] chapter went all the way through the
[1:36:21] entire book it wasn't going to stop with
[1:36:24] the story to limit lack and his death it
[1:36:26] wasn't gonna stop mail on and chillin on
[1:36:28] it wasn't going to stop with Orpha I
[1:36:30] want believing Naomi but it was gonna be
[1:36:33] a story of Ruth of someone who should
[1:36:35] have never been found in the pages of
[1:36:37] the Bible but because she made the right
[1:36:39] choice and the right decision she falls
[1:36:42] in line with the purpose of God and she
[1:36:45] goes on to a line of redemption glory
[1:36:48] you know we've preached on that here
[1:36:51] before judges and Ruth we showed how
[1:36:53] that the book of judges and Ruth the
[1:36:55] Jewish Bible have bound is one book
[1:36:56] they're not two separated books because
[1:36:58] judges was going to be all of our
[1:37:00] circles and cycles and patterns but
[1:37:03] judges ends just three miles from
[1:37:06] Bethlehem Judea where the story of Ruth
[1:37:08] takes place judges the book of Judges
[1:37:11] ends and now you have judges who are
[1:37:14] circles and now Ruth is going to be not
[1:37:17] a circle it's gonna be a line a line of
[1:37:20] redemption it's a story about a mole by
[1:37:22] this woman a worldly girl who never had
[1:37:24] a chance who should have never been
[1:37:26] found written that in the in the end of
[1:37:28] in the Bible today but now we're
[1:37:29] preaching about her today because she
[1:37:31] made the right choice oh it's a romance
[1:37:34] but the random says whose type in the
[1:37:36] romance between Christ and his bride you
[1:37:38] can see it in so many facets and lessons
[1:37:40] and great lessons it shows the kindness
[1:37:42] of a man like Boaz as the kindness
[1:37:45] the hard kind-hearted of Jesus Christ
[1:37:47] that take upon himself unworthy Moabite
[1:37:50] woman named Ruth and not just take her
[1:37:53] but take everything that belong to her
[1:37:56] he didn't dis take her my brother my
[1:37:58] sister I want you to catch this here
[1:38:00] today because it's a type of your
[1:38:01] kinsman redeemer he didn't just purchase
[1:38:04] you he took all your baggage he took all
[1:38:07] of your tile he took all of your past he
[1:38:10] took it all unto himself and he says
[1:38:13] Ruth I'll take you and I'll take
[1:38:15] everything that comes with you I know
[1:38:17] what I'm getting when I buy it I know
[1:38:18] I'm buying I'm purchasing not just you
[1:38:20] as an individual but everything
[1:38:22] connected to you I'm redeeming because
[1:38:25] I'm your kinsman redeemer it was
[1:38:27] literally the story of redemption being
[1:38:30] played out in the life of a little
[1:38:33] Moabite woman brother Brandon would use
[1:38:35] this story to preach the message the
[1:38:36] kinsman redeemer go listen to it if you
[1:38:38] haven't listened to it recently and he
[1:38:40] took this out of Naomi being a type of
[1:38:43] that wore that oxygen church ruth being
[1:38:46] a type of that Gentile bride and how
[1:38:48] this woman ruth or the rhythm says
[1:38:50] should have never been in the story we
[1:38:52] should even read about her she should
[1:38:54] have this died like all the other girls
[1:38:55] heathens in in MO and in the land of
[1:38:57] Moab but somehow God leads a man a limo
[1:39:00] like God I limit like makes a choice you
[1:39:03] said by the night was that the
[1:39:04] leadership of God brother and it says
[1:39:05] even the permissive will of God God will
[1:39:07] turn it around and make it bring glory
[1:39:09] out of it look what he does here he
[1:39:12] takes this decision of a limit like a
[1:39:14] brother and sis a woman who should have
[1:39:15] never been mentioned in the Bible he
[1:39:17] says he says you should have never found
[1:39:19] and found in the story and the pages of
[1:39:22] what we read but now her name is forever
[1:39:25] imprinted on the story of redemption but
[1:39:29] you didn't think that sister Naomi when
[1:39:31] you were dealing with your bitterness
[1:39:33] and you were dealing with the hardness
[1:39:35] of that situation you had no idea that
[1:39:38] it was going to redeem you oh so much of
[1:39:41] this story of Ruth this Moabite a
[1:39:43] stranger from the promises of God but
[1:39:46] some how in her life God came and made a
[1:39:51] decision I'm gonna rewrite her life I'm
[1:39:54] gonna interrupt the story I'm gonna
[1:39:57] and erupted the program I'm gonna
[1:39:59] interrupt the program the satan had for
[1:40:01] I'm gonna implant myself I'm gonna
[1:40:03] interject myself and rewrite Ruth's
[1:40:05] entire story of her life and she finds
[1:40:09] herself with a mother Lorna and Naomi
[1:40:11] and in here married to her son son dies
[1:40:15] we see death you know all of these types
[1:40:17] and shadows you could look at the type
[1:40:19] of the death of the husband being a type
[1:40:20] of Israel and that the the brother
[1:40:23] branham picks this up and says being a
[1:40:24] widow she's left a widow like Israel is
[1:40:27] left widowed away from Jehovah because
[1:40:29] they had left him and I want how that
[1:40:31] she has two sons and just like whose
[1:40:35] sons are gonna be split two kingdoms and
[1:40:39] Judah and Benjamin and how that death
[1:40:41] would happen in Canaan it was all typed
[1:40:43] here right here in the story of Ruth we
[1:40:45] find that Ruth how that Ruth was a
[1:40:48] nobody
[1:40:48] as we said she was nobody but she finds
[1:40:53] herself gleaning in the right field
[1:40:57] somehow fast forward her story was
[1:41:00] started with such bitterness was such a
[1:41:03] bad stones or self-cleaning and the
[1:41:05] right field she made the right choice to
[1:41:07] stay with the word and she finds herself
[1:41:09] gleaning in the field of Boaz and the
[1:41:12] Bible says that Boaz looks upon her and
[1:41:14] little corner in a little field
[1:41:16] somewhere Boaz pays attention and he
[1:41:18] pays special interest she finds favor
[1:41:20] this little nobody and the Bible says
[1:41:23] she finds favor and the sight of Boaz
[1:41:25] old sister Ruth let me tell you
[1:41:28] something you didn't have a chance in
[1:41:29] your lineage you didn't have a chance in
[1:41:31] your inheritance
[1:41:32] your family was know was was Moabites
[1:41:35] they were heathens they were just gonna
[1:41:36] die they were living under a curse all
[1:41:38] of your blood and let me just say this
[1:41:41] to you today
[1:41:42] if Ruth's blood had prevailed Ruth would
[1:41:45] have never been found in the pages of
[1:41:47] this Bible but it was going to not be
[1:41:49] Ruth's blood it was going to be God's
[1:41:52] blood who was going to prevail it wasn't
[1:41:54] going to be Ruth's bloodline and Ruth's
[1:41:56] lineage it was going to prevail but she
[1:41:59] would find herself in the lineage
[1:42:01] Redemption because an unstoppable
[1:42:03] purpose of God an unstoppable plan an
[1:42:06] unstoppable determination decided to
[1:42:09] redeem an unworthy Moabite all my
[1:42:12] brother my sister you are only here
[1:42:14] today under the preaching of the
[1:42:16] revealed Word of the hour because God
[1:42:19] changed your story god interjected and
[1:42:23] interrupted your life and decided to
[1:42:25] redeem you when you were on redeemable
[1:42:27] we ought to give him thanks and giving
[1:42:30] praise for that it's only by Sovereign
[1:42:32] Grace we find this unstoppable purpose
[1:42:37] this is stoppable plan oh this
[1:42:41] unstoppable God Oh what we spoken last
[1:42:44] asunder the unstoppable two Sundays ago
[1:42:46] though for Ruth listen there Ruth you
[1:42:49] can see the unstoppable purpose of God
[1:42:51] that God had a plan for Ruth's life long
[1:42:55] before the devil had planned to destroy
[1:42:58] and leave her in ruin he thought he had
[1:43:01] planned her life to die as a Moabite
[1:43:03] serving Moloch that's the god of the
[1:43:06] Moabites but God who is rich in mercy
[1:43:09] who had an unstoppable purpose oh my
[1:43:14] brother my sister we can just preach to
[1:43:15] you right there the Bible says but God
[1:43:18] who was rich in mercy
[1:43:20] oh I don't care what you want to put
[1:43:22] behind there today you could say I was
[1:43:24] living in sin but God who is rich in
[1:43:27] mercy I was on a barstool but God who is
[1:43:30] rich in mercy
[1:43:31] I was groveling in despair but God who
[1:43:35] is rich in mercy I was a million miles
[1:43:37] away but God who is rich in mercy
[1:43:40] decided to save me and redeem me it's an
[1:43:43] unstoppable purpose that was being
[1:43:45] written in the life of this woman Ruth
[1:43:49] in you know what you see is an overall
[1:43:50] theme when you read the entire story of
[1:43:53] the Book of Ruth here's what you see
[1:43:54] there's a theme that comes out of every
[1:43:56] chapter God is in control God is in
[1:44:03] control let that settle your heart today
[1:44:07] I don't care what what situation here
[1:44:09] and today no matter what the home that
[1:44:11] you're in that chair you're sitting in
[1:44:12] there in the church today watch it
[1:44:14] online and streaming
[1:44:15] just let the would let the Word of God
[1:44:17] be a security to you no matter what you
[1:44:20] face here's what I'm gonna say to you
[1:44:22] God is in control he is controlling
[1:44:28] everything he's not just the creator of
[1:44:31] the universe
[1:44:31] he's the dictator he's the controller
[1:44:34] he's the architect he's the designer of
[1:44:37] time of stories no matter who it is no
[1:44:39] matter what it is God is in control and
[1:44:43] he's sovereign in every situation he's
[1:44:48] sovereign in every situation the Bible
[1:44:51] says in this way that he worketh
[1:44:53] everything after the counsel of his own
[1:44:57] will that mean means God doesn't need to
[1:45:01] advise with anybody doesn't need
[1:45:02] advisors yeah he does he doesn't need to
[1:45:05] counsel with anybody
[1:45:06] God is not influenced by anyone his
[1:45:10] choices are not based on the influence
[1:45:12] of something that happened and at least
[1:45:14] a brother Matt wasn't important because
[1:45:16] that means you're gonna see your bad
[1:45:17] mess ups and mistakes and failures
[1:45:19] doesn't influence his opinion and his
[1:45:22] purpose of what he's gonna bring in your
[1:45:24] life nothing changes
[1:45:26] this God he's unstoppable he's
[1:45:30] unshakable he's unrelenting he has an
[1:45:33] unstoppable purpose hallelujah oh he's
[1:45:37] not required to give an explanation to
[1:45:39] anyone for the choices he what do we
[1:45:42] realize this is the God that we're
[1:45:43] serving here today
[1:45:44] he doesn't know an explanation anyone
[1:45:46] not me not you not the president not
[1:45:47] anybody he doesn't know an explanation
[1:45:49] to anybody he doesn't need to give her a
[1:45:52] reason you know he doesn't rely on the
[1:45:54] wisdom of anyone he doesn't have a
[1:45:57] counsel that he goes to in the time of
[1:45:59] crisis why because he never has a crisis
[1:46:03] everything is orchestrated I didn't the
[1:46:05] studies we've been during the book of
[1:46:06] Daniel hope you've called that theme
[1:46:08] that God is orchestrating everything
[1:46:11] it's all one big drama and you're part
[1:46:15] of it and I'm part of it and I say today
[1:46:19] Lord let me play my part let me play it
[1:46:21] well bring forth the sweet fragrance of
[1:46:25] your purpose out of my life and
[1:46:26] everything that I do
[1:46:27] oh let me just say this to you here
[1:46:31] today my brother my sister the ants were
[1:46:34] preaching on the in stoppable purpose of
[1:46:36] God let me just say this here sometimes
[1:46:38] we won't spend our entire life trying to
[1:46:42] figure out the purpose of God what is
[1:46:45] God's purpose for me for that for this
[1:46:48] that happened for this over here let me
[1:46:50] just let me just let me just break the
[1:46:52] ice here you will never fully understand
[1:46:55] the purpose of God in this life I won't
[1:46:57] you won't designed it that way they
[1:47:02] designed it that way
[1:47:03] because faith is it's not things hoped
[1:47:08] for the evidence of things not seen are
[1:47:10] things that we don't understand we won't
[1:47:13] ever understand all the purposes of God
[1:47:15] I can say this he doesn't have to
[1:47:18] explain his purpose to me he doesn't
[1:47:19] even have to reveal his purpose to me
[1:47:21] let me let me go further
[1:47:23] you can't dissect the purpose of God
[1:47:26] it's not made that way you can't deduct
[1:47:29] the purpose of God by looking at certain
[1:47:32] things and rationalizing certain things
[1:47:34] people have tried to do this for ages
[1:47:36] let me just say if you try to this son
[1:47:38] dissect everything that's happened as a
[1:47:40] son of God or a daughter of God you try
[1:47:41] to deduct everything you'll lose your
[1:47:43] mind going crazy you can't understand it
[1:47:46] all why does God allow what has got a
[1:47:48] lot of us we try to figure it all out we
[1:47:50] have to come to this resolution and I
[1:47:52] hope you can lift your hand and say this
[1:47:54] today by faith I can't figure out
[1:47:56] everything that's going to happen I
[1:47:58] can't figure out everything that's
[1:47:59] happened in my past or what's happened
[1:48:01] in my present I can't have know God's
[1:48:03] purpose for everything but I will rest
[1:48:06] in this confidence I will rest in this
[1:48:10] revelation that he is sovereign over
[1:48:12] everything in my life he is perfect in
[1:48:15] all of his decisions and he doesn't make
[1:48:19] mistakes I said he doesn't make mistakes
[1:48:24] there are no accidents there's no
[1:48:27] mess-ups
[1:48:28] there's no reduce God doesn't make
[1:48:31] mistakes let that resound in your soul
[1:48:36] today he never
[1:48:38] makes I don't care what the devil has
[1:48:40] ever lied to you about no matter what
[1:48:42] ever happened to you or didn't happen in
[1:48:44] your life no matter what dream was
[1:48:46] unfulfilled no matter what purpose and
[1:48:48] you're trying to find them trying to
[1:48:49] figure it out just know this God makes
[1:48:52] no mistakes your life is not a mistake
[1:48:54] nothing's happened to you today that's
[1:48:57] not been by His perfect order the
[1:49:00] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:49:02] of the Lord it's why brother Aaron says
[1:49:04] God deals with Israel as a nation but it
[1:49:06] gives with the Gentile brightest
[1:49:07] individuals
[1:49:08] meaning he deals with you on an
[1:49:10] individual basis and this great planner
[1:49:16] this great schemer the same one who
[1:49:19] wrote the life of Naomi and Ruth this
[1:49:22] great architect this great engineer has
[1:49:26] written a blueprint for your life he's
[1:49:29] written a blueprint and there's no
[1:49:32] revisions you no blueprint work when I
[1:49:34] have to study blueprint had studying
[1:49:36] blueprints for jobs and projects man you
[1:49:37] have to go through every detail every
[1:49:38] note then you'd have to be updated on on
[1:49:42] a software that they used so that you
[1:49:43] could get all the revisions and
[1:49:45] architect all we made a mistake over
[1:49:46] here engineer made a mistake over here
[1:49:47] we got a fixers got a rabbi this let me
[1:49:49] just give you the simple plain truth
[1:49:51] today
[1:49:51] there's no revisions needed from your
[1:49:54] life there's no revisions needed from
[1:49:56] anything that's happened it is perfect
[1:49:58] his plans that he's made for me David
[1:50:01] said are perfect
[1:50:03] hallelujah nothing happens by chance
[1:50:07] I know that's hard to get your mind
[1:50:08] around today some of us it's harder for
[1:50:11] others because some of us have went
[1:50:12] through some really tough things some of
[1:50:14] us are going through some tough things
[1:50:16] some of us are facing difficulties and
[1:50:19] we can only say a man by faith because
[1:50:21] there's a seed gene of God down inside
[1:50:22] of us because you could never muster out
[1:50:24] an amen going through some of these
[1:50:26] things some of the hardships that you
[1:50:28] went through some of the difficulties in
[1:50:30] your past some of the wreckage and
[1:50:32] carnage you look at in your past
[1:50:36] make sense of it it's hard mentally to
[1:50:40] just accept that you've got I can only
[1:50:41] accept it by revelation in faith but I
[1:50:43] say to you today accept it by revelation
[1:50:45] and faith it's hard to understood to sit
[1:50:49] to say that it's hard to understand
[1:50:51] because some of us have dealt there said
[1:50:52] winters and really painful things in our
[1:50:55] life you know that was that word pain
[1:50:58] was the only thing these three girls
[1:51:00] really Naomi Ruth Orpah they had one
[1:51:03] thing in common pain they had one
[1:51:06] commonality what's what what sorrow
[1:51:09] suffering pain they were in sorrow
[1:51:12] together asking why did I lose my
[1:51:14] husband why I wanted to lose they were
[1:51:22] dragged away from Bethlehem notice this
[1:51:24] here to Moab just for their loved ones
[1:51:27] to die is that was that the purpose of
[1:51:29] God in their life they were surrounded
[1:51:31] and suffocating under this feeling of
[1:51:36] despair under this filling of pain in
[1:51:41] the space of just 10 years she loses now
[1:51:44] and loses as a husband both sons this is
[1:51:46] why she says notice what she says here
[1:51:48] she says I went out fool oh and Naomi
[1:51:52] she felt so empty she felt so confused
[1:51:57] oh she felt such loss
[1:52:00] oh she loses everything she's in the
[1:52:04] midst of a famine and pain is the word
[1:52:07] that she's familiar with Retta just a
[1:52:11] little devotional was by a man I'm just
[1:52:14] speaking about some of the trials in his
[1:52:16] own life it was one a wonderful little
[1:52:18] devotion I thought it was so wonderful
[1:52:19] he spoke about pain and he spoke about
[1:52:21] some of the successes and the some
[1:52:24] horror he went with there's some really
[1:52:25] hard things in his life and had a lot of
[1:52:27] loss in his life and a lot of
[1:52:28] misunderstanding things he couldn't make
[1:52:30] sense of and he pinned this and I'm
[1:52:32] gonna read it a thought of a so profound
[1:52:34] he said pain is a strange company keeper
[1:52:38] it brings the oddest people together
[1:52:44] there's a secret fraternity that exists
[1:52:47] between people who have been in pain
[1:52:50] that is mind boggling the connection
[1:52:53] that they have it transcends the color
[1:52:56] of your skin when you have been through
[1:52:59] certain things that other people have
[1:53:00] been through you feel like you can
[1:53:02] relate to them you know it's amazing you
[1:53:05] can take two people who have nothing in
[1:53:06] common never met each other but just let
[1:53:08] them go through the same loss or same
[1:53:10] sorry both lose a husband both lose a
[1:53:11] son and some accidents just whatever it
[1:53:13] is both of them have to go through some
[1:53:15] same trial there's immediately an
[1:53:17] affinity and a bond and a connection and
[1:53:19] they feel they can they you you know you
[1:53:21] can relate to them they have something
[1:53:23] in common something comes between
[1:53:25] there's something between those people
[1:53:27] because they can relate to each other
[1:53:29] they can enter in it says why brother
[1:53:31] Branham says you can pray for people but
[1:53:32] if you really want to pray you enter
[1:53:34] into their suffering and he says here he
[1:53:40] says there's a bond and he says he says
[1:53:43] you feel for other people who have been
[1:53:45] through those things because you can
[1:53:47] relate to them and he goes on further he
[1:53:49] says personally he says I I don't I
[1:53:52] don't have a lot to do with people who
[1:53:54] have never been through pain it's
[1:53:56] nothing against them I hold nothing
[1:53:59] against them I just can't relate to them
[1:54:01] and I'm sure they can't relate to me
[1:54:05] either he says because the parts of me
[1:54:09] that make up who I am the parts of me
[1:54:12] that I need to have touched the parts of
[1:54:16] me that I need fellowship in the parts
[1:54:19] of me that I need to be healed in there
[1:54:23] tied up not in the successes of my life
[1:54:27] but they are tied up and bound up in the
[1:54:30] struggles of my life for God has done
[1:54:34] more through my struggles than in my
[1:54:37] successes and if you look carefully at
[1:54:40] my successes they are made up out of the
[1:54:43] ingredients of my struggles and you can
[1:54:46] never know my successes until you
[1:54:49] understand my struggles because they are
[1:54:53] the pathway that led me to my successes
[1:54:57] this is exactly the
[1:55:00] domani of cisternae on me it was going
[1:55:04] to be the hardest struggle of her life
[1:55:06] it was going to be the hardest pain that
[1:55:09] she ever went through she has something
[1:55:11] in common with these girls they have
[1:55:13] suffered loss they had suffered pain it
[1:55:16] struggled they were struggling the Bible
[1:55:19] says they lifted up their voices and
[1:55:20] they wept all together you can hear them
[1:55:23] weeping over the sorrow that they had
[1:55:26] died in their life and to make matters
[1:55:28] worse Naomi is a stranger in Moab she's
[1:55:31] been sitting there she doesn't know
[1:55:32] anybody she has no family
[1:55:34] she's not just suffering pain but the
[1:55:36] Bible says they lifted up their voice
[1:55:39] and they wept and I could imagine here
[1:55:42] as I just ponder that here for a moment
[1:55:45] as I enter in and maybe you can just
[1:55:46] peek in just here for a moment as sister
[1:55:48] Naomi she feels so empty she feels so
[1:55:52] confused her life just doesn't make any
[1:55:55] sense doesn't make any sense what
[1:55:57] happened oh that's what she says I left
[1:56:00] full but now I'm empty don't call me
[1:56:05] Naomi call me Mara from bitter God has
[1:56:08] dealt bitterly with me she was saying
[1:56:10] leave me alone
[1:56:11] my life is over don't you understand my
[1:56:14] mind my life is over I don't have time
[1:56:18] to live life again I can't win back the
[1:56:21] hand of time I don't have time to have
[1:56:24] more children and yet she says if I did
[1:56:27] you would want you to wait on them and
[1:56:28] Marianela them already don't you get it
[1:56:31] I I can't do it all over again you ever
[1:56:34] felt that way I don't get a redo can't
[1:56:38] redo it all my story's already been
[1:56:41] written I'm already done my husband has
[1:56:46] died I'm a widow in a strange land
[1:56:49] Oh sister Naomi was so discouraged
[1:56:52] she was so suffocating under this
[1:56:55] distress she literally was saying don't
[1:56:57] lean on me anymore because I have
[1:56:59] nothing to give you I'm empty I have
[1:57:01] nothing to offer you
[1:57:02] I can't offer you any wisdom I can't
[1:57:04] offer you any blessing because I myself
[1:57:07] I'm empty I can't give you anything my
[1:57:10] life is over don't you see she but you
[1:57:13] know what my brother my sister here's
[1:57:15] what damn we didn't realize she realized
[1:57:17] it later but Naomi didn't realize one
[1:57:20] secret about this trial and about the
[1:57:23] sorrow she didn't realize that though
[1:57:26] the devil and tempt attempted and was
[1:57:28] intent on destroying her to bring her
[1:57:31] such suffering but she didn't realize
[1:57:34] that it would be through that suffering
[1:57:39] that God would produce Ruth in her life
[1:57:43] it would be Sir Ruth where God was going
[1:57:47] to connect to a bull as it would be
[1:57:50] through a Boaz the gunner was gonna make
[1:57:52] a Jesse oh it would be through a Jessie
[1:57:54] the dog was gonna bring it David it
[1:57:56] would be through a David this Jesus
[1:57:58] Christ would come Naomi you didn't
[1:58:00] realize that it was your suffering that
[1:58:02] would secure your own Redemption Oh
[1:58:06] hallelujah friends I feel anointed right
[1:58:08] now it is through your suffering that
[1:58:11] God is going to bring a Ruth and bring a
[1:58:13] bow ass and does that bring Jesse in a
[1:58:15] David and a Jesus who would save your
[1:58:17] family Naomi and it would be through
[1:58:20] your suffering but you didn't realize it
[1:58:23] it was going to be that suffering that
[1:58:25] was literally going to secure your
[1:58:29] Redemption
[1:58:31] why than that because God has an
[1:58:35] unstoppable purpose it was literally a
[1:58:40] drama playing out in Naomi's life right
[1:58:44] when she thought of her time was up and
[1:58:46] her time was over it was just the
[1:58:48] beginning of her joy and her Redemption
[1:58:52] God is sovereign over your life today
[1:58:58] he's sovereign over my life today oh I
[1:59:02] hope you can just receive that here as
[1:59:04] we close here today musicians could you
[1:59:07] return I hope you can just receive this
[1:59:09] brother Branham says she made it was why
[1:59:12] you say why because Ruth made a
[1:59:14] clear-cut decision she made a clear-cut
[1:59:17] decision oh listen to what brother
[1:59:20] Branham says
[1:59:21] he says in the next slide he says all
[1:59:23] how I like that little Ruth
[1:59:26] he says she had to make a decision he
[1:59:30] says I had to make a decision you've got
[1:59:32] to make a decision you never walk out of
[1:59:34] those doors this morning without some
[1:59:36] kind of a decision you'll not leave this
[1:59:38] room today there being a better woman or
[1:59:40] a worse man or a worse woman to reject
[1:59:42] it it'll be worse so to be harder the
[1:59:43] next time before you to get over or
[1:59:45] you'll get better it'll come a showdown
[1:59:47] next slide in her life it comes to
[1:59:50] showdown in everybody's life and Ruth
[1:59:52] had to make a decision so the Bible says
[1:59:54] that her mother-in-law taught her go
[1:59:55] back to your gods like your sister did
[1:59:57] go back like the lukewarm did why don't
[1:59:58] you just go back the gospel preacher if
[2:00:00] you want to go on go on the real
[2:00:02] truthful preacher that'll put it before
[2:00:04] the class of people you make your
[2:00:06] decision you stand on your feet the
[2:00:08] lukewarm wishy-washy
[2:00:10] in and out won't say that but a real
[2:00:11] servant of God will lay it on your lap
[2:00:13] make your decision and Ruth said next
[2:00:17] slide I'll go where you go your people
[2:00:21] will be my people your God will be my
[2:00:23] god where you live I'll live where you
[2:00:25] die I die where you're buried I'll be
[2:00:27] buried that's there's the real decision
[2:00:30] Lord I'll take you as my Saviour if the
[2:00:32] Bible says repent and be baptized in the
[2:00:34] name of Jesus Christ that I'll do if the
[2:00:35] must receive the Holy Ghost that I'll do
[2:00:37] Bible Tesman Jesus Christ the same
[2:00:39] yesterday today and forever that I'll
[2:00:40] believe I'll take the Bible and God for
[2:00:44] what he's raped and what he is no matter
[2:00:46] what any body else says there's the real
[2:00:50] next slide there's the real Ruth she
[2:00:54] made her decision she had to either go
[2:00:56] back or go forward we stand on the same
[2:00:59] grounds this morning go back or go
[2:01:02] forward don't never go back let's go
[2:01:06] forward
[2:01:07] Onan through the promised land they went
[2:01:11] into the land of strange people oh
[2:01:13] brother Branham says oh he says that's
[2:01:17] what the Ruth had to do she had to come
[2:01:20] from her own over to know the people she
[2:01:21] was converted she made a decision and
[2:01:23] you make a decision you've got to take
[2:01:25] your choice you want to go back to the
[2:01:26] things of the world you want to go with
[2:01:28] God you want to act like the ward of the
[2:01:29] rest of them then kiss Christ goodbye
[2:01:31] and go back but if you want to take
[2:01:33] way with the Lord's despise fuel can you
[2:01:35] raise your hands this morning and say
[2:01:36] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[2:01:38] despise few and a hold of God's
[2:01:41] unchanging hands regardless of what the
[2:01:43] rest of the world says you hold right
[2:01:45] there God said so it's true I believe it
[2:01:47] though I can't make it manifest in my
[2:01:50] life God said so I believe it I'll hold
[2:01:53] right there go to the next slide that's
[2:01:55] the way she did to Naomi
[2:01:57] I'll not leave you I'll go where you go
[2:01:59] your people will be my people the way
[2:02:01] they act that's the way our the way they
[2:02:03] do that's what I'll do the way they
[2:02:05] think that's what Ollie where you die
[2:02:07] I'll die but you're buried I'll bow be
[2:02:09] buried and the Lord do more to me if I
[2:02:11] fail that's a real clean-cut decision
[2:02:13] God wants clean-cut decisions out of his
[2:02:18] church I say to you to you today get on
[2:02:21] the unstoppable purpose of God for your
[2:02:24] life
