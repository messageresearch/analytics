[9:51] He brought me out of the I
[9:56] reclaim. He set my feet on the rock to
[10:02] stay. He puts a song in my soul
[10:08] today. A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[10:12] [Music]
[10:16] My heart was
[10:18] distressed Jehovah's dreadf frown. And
[10:23] low in the pits where my sins dragged me
[10:27] down. I cried to the Lord from the deep
[10:33] my
[10:34] reclaim who tenderly brought me out to
[10:38] golden days.
[10:41] He brought me out of the mighty
[10:46] clay. He set my feet on the rock to
[10:52] stay. He puts a hole in my soul
[10:58] today. A song of praise.
[11:04] Hallelujah. He placed me upon the strong
[11:08] rock by his side.
[11:11] My steps were established and here I'll
[11:15] abide with no danger of falling from
[11:20] here I
[11:22] remain. But stand by his grace until the
[11:26] crown I
[11:28] bring. He brought me out of the mighty
[11:33] flame.
[11:35] He set my feet on the rock to
[11:40] sing. He puts the song in my soul
[11:46] today. A song of praise.
[11:52] Hallelujah. He gave me a song was a new
[11:57] song of praise. By day and by night,
[12:02] it's sweet notes I will raise. My
[12:05] heart's
[12:07] overflowing. I'm happy and free. I'll
[12:11] praise my redeemer who has resued
[12:16] me. He brought me out of the myy flame.
[12:23] He set my feet on the rock to
[12:28] stay. He puts the song in my soul
[12:34] today. A song of praise.
[12:40] Hallelujah. I'll sing of his wonderful
[12:44] mercy to me. I'll praise him to all men.
[12:50] His goodness shall sing.
[12:52] I'll sing of
[12:55] salvation home and abroad. Till many
[13:00] shall hear the truth. Trust in
[13:04] God. He brought me out of the mighty
[13:10] clay. He set my feet on the rock to
[13:15] sing.
[13:17] He puts a song in my soul
[13:21] today. A song of praise.
[13:28] Hallelujah. Count of the dead with its
[13:32] gloom and
[13:33] despair. I'll praise your father
[13:38] who my prayer. I'll sing my new song in
[13:43] the joy of love. world and joy in the
[13:48] forest. You got that reservation made
[13:51] for
[13:51] that. He brought me out of
[13:56] the
[13:57] clay. He set my feet on the rock to
[14:03] sing. He puts the song my soul
[14:09] today. A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[14:17] Amen. He did it all. Amen. That's so
[14:20] good. So, we do have a a couple of
[14:24] requests and um
[14:29] uh pray for for Rebecca. Believe she's
[14:33] been visiting here. She had to go to the
[14:36] hospital today.
[14:38] Sister Amelia, she is in pain, having
[14:41] some trouble walking, and possibly
[14:43] having to have some surgery. So, let's
[14:45] remember her. And I believe Sister
[14:48] Sharon here asks prayer for the
[14:50] neighbors family for their their loss
[14:52] from a past, someone passing away. So,
[14:55] you know, it's it's well, we have a
[14:57] great comforter.
[14:59] You know, it's it's he was the only one
[15:01] that could give his life and raise it
[15:04] back in, back it up, and he can be
[15:07] touched by the filling of our
[15:09] infirmities. So, if you you believe that
[15:11] and you have a request, if you'll stand
[15:14] and brother Dan, would you take that
[15:17] prayer
[15:21] request? God bless you, brothers and
[15:23] sisters. Let's bow our heads.
[15:26] [Music]
[15:28] Almighty God, we should never take it
[15:29] for granted that we can bow our heads to
[15:33] the ground from once we came and lift
[15:36] our prayers up to the Almighty
[15:39] God. Father, Sister
[15:42] Amelia, and her knee problem. Lord, she
[15:46] trusts in you so
[15:49] much. Father, I know that that you have
[15:53] your hand on her and you love her now as
[15:55] her friend. Lord, we lift up a prayer
[15:58] for her that you would heal her
[16:01] body and Rebecca, Father, and the
[16:05] troubles that she has. I pray for her
[16:07] that that you would help her, Father.
[16:10] May the doctors find nothing wrong with
[16:13] her. Father, I pray that you would
[16:15] encourage her
[16:16] heart, Lord, to come closer to you and
[16:20] and Father, be a better Christian and a
[16:23] better servant to you, Father. And then
[16:26] all of us, Lord, and the requests that
[16:28] we have on our hearts for ourselves and
[16:32] for our
[16:33] families, those Lord that are streaming
[16:36] in right now and and listening to the
[16:40] song and worship service and listening
[16:42] to this prayer for each one, Lord, that
[16:45] would have a request upon their heart. I
[16:47] pray that, Lord, that you would hear it
[16:49] and then, Lord, that you would answer
[16:51] from heaven. Father, we ask these things
[16:54] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[16:58] [Music]
[17:01] He brought me out of the miry clay and
[17:03] now I want a closer walk with him. You
[17:06] know how you you get a closer walk with
[17:09] somebody? You walk with them. You talk
[17:11] with them. You spend time with them.
[17:13] That's how you get to know them.
[17:17] [Music]
[17:21] I am weak, but thou art
[17:25] [Music]
[17:29] strong.
[17:31] Jesus, keep me from all
[17:37] wrong. And I'll be
[17:41] satisfied as
[17:45] long as I walk. Let me walk close to
[17:54] thee.
[17:56] Just a closer walk with thee.
[18:01] [Music]
[18:05] Grant it. Jesus is my
[18:11] place.
[18:14] Daily walking close to
[18:19] thee. Let it
[18:22] be, dear Lord. Let it be.
[18:29] and
[18:30] through this world of toils and
[18:37] snare. If I falter, Lord, who
[18:45] cares? And
[18:47] who with me my burden
[18:53] share? None but
[18:56] thee, dear Lord. None but
[19:03] thee.
[19:04] Just a closer walk with
[19:11] thee.
[19:13] Granted, Jesus is my plea.
[19:22] daily walking close to
[19:27] thee, let it
[19:30] be, dear Lord, let it be.
[19:37] And
[19:38] when my feeble life is
[19:45] old,
[19:47] time for me shall be no
[19:54] more.
[19:55] Guide me gently, safely,
[20:01] oh to thy kingom.
[20:05] show to thy
[20:11] shore.
[20:12] Just a closer walk with
[20:19] thee.
[20:21] Granted, Jesus is my plea.
[20:30] daily walking close to
[20:35] thee. Let it
[20:38] be, dear Lord. Let it be. One more time.
[20:42] Just
[20:44] asking. Oh,
[20:46] just a closer walk with thee.
[20:55] Granted, Jesus is my
[21:02] place.
[21:04] Daily walking close to
[21:09] thee. Let it
[21:12] be, dear Lord. Let it be.
[21:18] [Music]
[21:20] Sister Hope, if you would make ready to
[21:23] sing, you may be
[21:24] seated. Sister Shirley Moore, she says,
[21:27] "I want to thank everyone for their
[21:30] prayers and praise God." He says, "Most
[21:34] of all, for a safe trip, but there's no
[21:38] place like home." Amen. With God's
[21:40] family. Amen. Amen. I had asked somebody
[21:44] to sit in your place so that chair
[21:46] wouldn't be empty.
[21:48] It's she's usually the first one here
[21:50] when you walk out and you're setting up.
[21:52] She's there. It's just you just get used
[21:53] to it. Sister Hope has a song. I
[21:56] appreciate that. Amen.
[22:04] [Music]
[22:06] Little
[22:10] David,
[22:13] oh, the eyes were just too high for
[22:17] little
[22:20] David. So he shook off all of his
[22:24] foes. With the power of God, he was
[22:27] clothed. The battle's not mine. and I
[22:30] give it to you. Lord, it's
[22:34] mine. Oh, the battle's not
[22:37] mine. Little David, Lord, it's in your
[22:42] favor. Sing it with me. I give it all to
[22:47] you. I knew not to
[22:54] do that. You're really all that I need.
[22:58] The battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[23:02] Lord. It's
[23:05] mine. Now, little David
[23:09] unafraid. But for the giant, he stood
[23:12] that
[23:13] day. It seemed to be the end for little
[23:18] David.
[23:21] But like the lion and the bear that he
[23:24] slew, that old giant would come down to
[23:28] the battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[23:32] Lord, it's
[23:35] mine. Oh, the battle's not mine, said
[23:38] little David. Lord, it's mine and I'm in
[23:42] your
[23:43] favor. I give it all to
[23:47] you. I knew not what to do. And I'm so
[23:52] glad you made me
[23:54] say that you're really all that I need.
[23:58] The battle's not mine. I give it to you.
[24:02] Lord,
[24:05] it's now little he stood
[24:10] tall. The giant stood so small.
[24:14] Sweet victory I reign for little
[24:20] David for he gave the battle to
[24:24] one who believed in getting things done
[24:28] the battle's not mine I give it to you
[24:32] Lord it's
[24:34] mine oh the battle's not mine said
[24:38] little David Lord it's mine and I'm in
[24:42] your
[24:43] favor I give it all to
[24:46] you. I knew not what to do. And I'm so
[24:51] glad you made me
[24:54] see that you're really all that I need.
[24:58] The battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[25:02] Lord. It's
[25:04] mine. The battle's not mine. I give it
[25:08] to you, Lord. It's mine.
[25:14] [Applause]
[25:23] I've asked brother Josiah to help us
[25:26] with this song. My hope is in the Lord.
[25:28] But as she sang the
[25:30] song, the battle is not mine. Dear Lord,
[25:33] I give it to you. When you give it to
[25:36] him, just let it go. Don't give it to
[25:38] him like this. I want to hang on to it.
[25:41] So I I I can help you out or no, just
[25:43] give it to him and let him lead you.
[25:45] Amen.
[25:48] My
[25:50] hope is in the
[25:54] Lord from this time
[25:57] on and ever more.
[26:02] Oh my
[26:05] hope is in the
[26:09] Lord
[26:11] forever more. Let's sing verse one.
[26:17] I stand in oh within the presence of the
[26:24] Lord in whom the wisdom of the
[26:32] aes for whom the rage of the
[26:36] sea
[26:39] subides the living
[26:42] [Music]
[26:43] sacrifice the only soul source of
[26:48] life. My
[26:51] hope is in the
[26:55] Lord this
[26:58] time and never
[27:01] more. Oh my
[27:05] hope is
[27:09] in forever
[27:13] more.
[27:17] first. His tender mercies come with
[27:21] every rising
[27:24] sun to meet the sinner and his
[27:28] [Music]
[27:32] broken to offer healing and forgiveness.
[27:40] And those who trust in him will find
[27:45] their
[27:46] hearts I bless my
[27:51] hope is in
[27:55] the time.
[27:58] Oh and never more.
[28:03] Oh my
[28:06] hope is in the
[28:10] Lord forever
[28:17] more. His tender mercies come with every
[28:22] rising
[28:25] sun to meet the sinner in his
[28:29] broken name.
[28:33] who offer healing and
[28:40] forgiveness. And those who trust in him
[28:45] find their
[28:47] hearts at rest. My
[28:51] hope is in
[28:55] good this
[28:59] time and ever
[29:02] more. Oh my
[29:06] hope is in
[29:10] the forever more.
[29:15] My
[29:16] hope, my
[29:19] hope is in the
[29:24] Lord. This time
[29:27] on and ever
[29:31] more. My
[29:34] hope is in the
[29:38] Lord forever more.
[29:45] Amen. Amen. I appreciate I have asked
[29:49] them to do this enough times. Sometimes
[29:51] I have trouble with some of the rhythms
[29:54] and they make it look so easy, but
[29:57] that's okay. And worship the Lord that
[30:00] way. My hope was in the Lord. And as I
[30:03] was listening to that song and the next
[30:06] song that came out, so let me walk with
[30:09] you,
[30:10] Jesus. It is it's not he's not letting
[30:13] you. You're actually telling yourself,
[30:15] "Let me walk with him because he'll
[30:18] never turn you away."
[30:23] So
[30:24] let me walk with you,
[30:31] Jesus. Don't
[30:34] ever leave me alone.
[30:39] [Music]
[30:41] For
[30:42] without you
[30:45] I could
[30:49] never. No,
[30:52] never make heaven my home. That first
[30:56] verse.
[30:59] Oh, I've been on the mountain with
[31:07] Jesus and I've been in the
[31:11] valley so
[31:15] long. But
[31:17] not one time has he failed me.
[31:25] and to him with my burdens I
[31:32] go. So let me walk with you
[31:40] [Music]
[31:41] Jesus. Don't
[31:44] never leave
[31:46] me. He promised he never would.
[31:50] For
[31:51] without you
[31:54] I could
[31:58] never. No,
[32:00] never make heaven my
[32:04] [Music]
[32:06] home. Oh, he found me when I was so
[32:12] lonely.
[32:16] He found me when I was so
[32:23] good. Yes, he found me when no one could
[32:29] help
[32:31] me. And I did not need a clean heart.
[32:42] Oh
[32:45] God, and renew a right
[32:49] spirit within
[32:55] me. Oh, create in me a clean heart.
[33:05] Oh
[33:09] God, renew a right
[33:12] spirit within
[33:19] me, and cast me not
[33:24] away from thy
[33:27] presence, oh
[33:30] Lord, and take not thy my holy spirit
[33:37] from
[33:38] [Music]
[33:41] me. Oh,
[33:43] restore unto
[33:47] me the joy of thy
[33:52] [Music]
[33:54] salvation and renew a right
[33:58] spirit within. Let's stand as we sing
[34:01] that one more time.
[34:05] Create in me a clean
[34:12] heart. Oh
[34:17] God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[34:26] [Music]
[34:28] Create in me a clean
[34:34] heart, oh
[34:39] God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[34:47] [Music]
[34:50] Cast me not
[34:53] away from thy
[34:56] presence, oh
[35:00] Lord. Take not thy holy spirit from
[35:10] me.
[35:12] Restore unto
[35:15] me the joy of thy
[35:22] salvation and renew a right
[35:25] spirit within
[35:30] me. Says, "Take not thy holy spirit for
[35:34] me. Restore unto me the joy of thy
[35:37] salvation." So you're not saving
[35:39] yourself. He's saving you and there's
[35:42] I'll fail myself every time but if he
[35:45] did it comes through that that's the joy
[35:47] of our salvation is him. So as brother
[35:50] Ly prepares
[35:53] um talking a little back there and he he
[35:57] talked about how many how much about
[35:59] Joseph and there's about three times as
[36:01] much about David as there is of Joseph.
[36:04] So, we got the next few months lined out
[36:06] that way. And I I
[36:09] won't Yeah, I will. Brother Dan goes,
[36:12] maybe I'll take the the Saul part of it
[36:16] and show the kind of the
[36:21] [Music]
[36:22] There's two sides, you know, and the
[36:26] Bible is it will show both sides. If we
[36:29] would get where only the good was shown
[36:31] in every scripture, we'd wonder what's
[36:34] wrong with
[36:35] us. But when you realize, hey, just like
[36:38] Paul who persecuted, God turned him
[36:42] around, God will do the same thing for
[36:44] us. Amen. In the presence of Jehovah.
[36:48] [Music]
[36:51] In the
[36:53] [Music]
[36:56] presence of
[36:58] [Music]
[37:03] Jehovah, God
[37:08] Almighty, the prince of peace.
[37:14] [Music]
[37:17] Trles
[37:19] [Applause]
[37:21] vanish and hearts are
[37:26] [Music]
[37:28] mened in the
[37:34] presence of the king. One more time.
[37:41] Oh, in the
[37:46] presence of
[37:52] Jehovah God Almighty.
[37:57] [Music]
[37:59] These
[38:02] [Music]
[38:05] branches
[38:06] trles
[38:08] [Music]
[38:11] vanish. Hearts are
[38:16] [Music]
[38:17] mended in the
[38:23] presence of the king. Once more, please.
[38:30] in the
[38:35] presence of
[38:37] [Music]
[38:41] Jehovah, God
[38:45] [Music]
[38:47] Almighty, Prince of
[38:50] [Music]
[38:53] Peace, trles manage,
[38:59] Hearts are
[39:04] bended in the
[39:08] [Music]
[39:10] presence of the
[39:16] King. Thank you so
[39:18] much. Good evening everyone.
[39:23] I'm really happy to be here tonight. I I
[39:26] wasn't here on Sunday because I wasn't
[39:29] feeling well. Turned in her prayer
[39:31] request and the Lord answered. On on
[39:35] Sunday, I was running a high fever. I
[39:38] could not speak a complete sentence and
[39:41] my breathing was very
[39:43] erratic. But God is here. He's present
[39:47] with us. He touches us. The fever broke.
[39:50] Praise the Lord.
[39:53] and my temperature has been normal for
[39:56] more than 48 hours. So, you're not going
[39:58] to get infected from what I had. I don't
[40:00] have it anymore. It's gone. Uh, and as I
[40:04] did with Joseph, I've got in the back
[40:06] there a few copies of a handout with the
[40:08] scriptures and so forth that we'll be
[40:09] using tonight that may be of
[40:14] assistance. It's Wednesday night. It's
[40:16] Bible study night. And this time, we're
[40:18] going to begin a series on the life of
[40:19] David. Our approach will be different
[40:22] than any I've seen or heard. So, I
[40:24] solicit your prayers that the Lord help
[40:26] and guide us. And I also solicit your
[40:30] feedback. And speaking of prayer and
[40:34] knowing that God hears and answers our
[40:36] prayers, and I'm standing here as a
[40:38] witness and a testimony tonight that
[40:40] that's exactly what he does. Let's go to
[40:42] him one more time. Lord Jesus, we're so
[40:46] grateful. the song that we just sang in
[40:48] the presence of Jehovah. Lord, that's
[40:50] where we want to be, Lord. We just thank
[40:54] you for your spirit, for your presence,
[40:56] for your love, for your grace, for your
[40:58] goodness, for your kindness, Lord. And
[41:01] most of all, not for what you do, but
[41:03] for who you are, Lord. We just pray that
[41:06] we can draw ever closer to you, ever
[41:08] closer in fellowship with one another,
[41:10] Lord. And till that time comes when
[41:12] we're just totally inseparable, Lord,
[41:15] that you can't tell one from the other.
[41:17] You can't tell anything from anything
[41:19] except it's just your presence
[41:21] permeating completely. Lord, we look
[41:24] forward to that time. And Lord, in the
[41:26] meantime, help us to be witnesses for
[41:28] you. Lord, help our lives to reflect the
[41:31] Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord, the grace
[41:34] that you extend to us, the unmmerited
[41:36] favor that you draw us to yourself. be
[41:39] with us this evening, Lord. Let nothing
[41:40] be said that would cause anyone
[41:42] difficulty or cause anyone to stumble or
[41:44] misunderstand, but Lord, may you just
[41:47] move by your spirit and through your
[41:49] word. Lord, we're so grateful for this
[41:52] opportunity and we thank you in Jesus
[41:54] precious name.
[41:59] Amen. For our opening verses, I'd like
[42:02] to read from two different places.
[42:06] The first is found in the New
[42:08] Testament. Paul, also first known as
[42:11] Saul, who happened to be a Benjaminite,
[42:14] and Barnabas are in the beginning of
[42:16] what we think of as their first
[42:18] missionary journey. They've left Cyprus,
[42:20] landed at Pergia. I'm sure everybody can
[42:23] read. It says right there, Pergia. You
[42:24] got Okay. And made the way to Antioch of
[42:28] Pacidia.
[42:30] The first sermon of that journey is
[42:31] recorded in Acts 13. Witnessing in the
[42:35] synagogue about Jesus the Messiah, Paul
[42:38] rehearses the Exodus under Moses and the
[42:40] conquests in Canaan under
[42:44] Joshua. We read after that the Lord gave
[42:48] unto Israel judges about the space of
[42:50] 450 years until Samuel the prophet.
[42:54] Afterward they desired a king. God gave
[42:58] unto them Saul, the son of Kish, a man
[43:00] of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space
[43:03] of 40
[43:04] years. And when the Lord had removed
[43:07] Saul, the Lord raised up unto Israel
[43:10] David to be their king, to whom he also
[43:13] gave
[43:14] testimony, and said, I have found David,
[43:18] the son of Jesse, a man after mine own
[43:22] heart, which shall fulfill all my will.
[43:27] of this man's descendants hath God
[43:29] according to his promise raised unto
[43:32] Israel a savior Jesus. I thank God he's
[43:36] raised him to us as well. The second
[43:39] reading before we're seated will be from
[43:42] 1st Samuel 13. That's the portion of the
[43:45] scripture that Paul was referring to in
[43:47] this sermon. The prophet Samuel is
[43:50] scolding King Saul for incomplete
[43:53] obedience to the Lord.
[43:58] And Samuel said to
[44:00] Saul, excuse me, thou hast done
[44:03] foolishly. Thou hast not kept the
[44:06] commandment of the Lord thy God, which
[44:07] he commanded thee. For now the Lord hath
[44:11] established thy kingdom upon Israel
[44:14] forever. But now thy kingdom shall not
[44:17] continue. The Lord hath sought him a man
[44:20] after his own heart, and the Lord hath
[44:23] commanded him to be captain over his
[44:27] people, because thou hast not kept that
[44:31] which the Lord commanded
[44:34] thee. Please be
[44:39] seated. What's the first thing that
[44:41] comes to your mind when you hear David
[44:44] in the context of the Bible?
[44:48] Do you think
[44:50] shepherd Goliath Basheba king Bethlehem
[44:56] Abselum bringing the ark to Jerusalem?
[45:00] Census or maybe
[45:03] musician, songwriter,
[45:05] poet, enthusiastic dancer,
[45:09] or do you think a man after God's own
[45:12] heart? Amen. And if
[45:15] so, what does that actually
[45:18] mean? In this series, I I'd like us to
[45:22] explore David's life through his
[45:25] heart. After
[45:27] all, if he was a man after God's own
[45:30] heart, then if we learn more of David's
[45:33] heart, we'll learn something about what
[45:35] God looks for and appreciates in us. And
[45:40] we should never lose sight of God's goal
[45:42] in all of
[45:43] this. It's about a right relationship
[45:46] with
[45:48] him. In studying Joseph, we read the
[45:51] final 13 chapters of Genesis, commented
[45:54] on them, drawing from other scriptures
[45:56] as well as some archaeology, history,
[45:58] and other extra biblical
[46:01] sources. David's story comprises 61
[46:05] chapters and portions of three books. 1
[46:08] Samuel, 1 Kings, and 1 Chronicles, and
[46:11] the entire book of 2 Samuel, there five
[46:16] times as much information. We're talking
[46:18] about a little bit in the back that,
[46:20] well, Joseph was a type of Christ, I
[46:23] said, but David was a type of
[46:28] us. We have almost no extra biblical
[46:32] evidence from the early years of the
[46:34] kingdom of Israel. No stone monuments,
[46:37] coins had not been invented. They
[46:39] wouldn't happen until uh the district of
[46:42] of Lydia, Anatolia in western Turkey
[46:45] about 500 years after David, the very
[46:48] first coins were ever minted. There's no
[46:50] commemorative plaques. There's no
[46:52] engraved items, no stones of celebration
[46:55] like we found in Egypt. No signate rings
[46:58] that have been found. no correspondence
[47:01] with other kingdoms or empires that have
[47:04] survived the approximately 3,000
[47:07] years. Virtually all the information
[47:11] that we have about David in the times in
[47:13] which he lived is from the
[47:15] Bible. That's our source and it's our
[47:18] trusted guide. We saw in Joseph it's
[47:22] reliable. We can trust it. So now when
[47:24] it becomes our only source, it's
[47:27] reliable. We can trust it. that's been
[47:30] established. And don't worry, we won't
[47:34] be reading all 61 of those chapters. I'm
[47:36] 75 years old and I'd like to survive
[47:39] this series. So, but we'll be reading
[47:42] from portions of
[47:44] them. Joseph's story, which we just
[47:46] finished exploring, was first written by
[47:48] Moses some 400 years after Joseph's
[47:52] death. There's no firsthand accounts
[47:55] relying solely on oral tradition and
[47:58] inspiration.
[47:59] That's true for the entire book of
[48:01] Genesis. On the other hand, David's life
[48:05] is mostly written by contemporaries, a
[48:08] sort of diary. The author or authors of
[48:12] First and 2 Samuel and First Kings are
[48:14] unknown to us. The reasons they wrote
[48:17] are
[48:18] undisclosed. 1 Chronicles is an
[48:21] exception. It was composed about 500
[48:24] years after David's death. It was
[48:27] written after the return from exile in
[48:29] the times of Ezra and Nehemiah, perhaps
[48:32] even later. In the Hebrew Bible, which
[48:35] we look at as the Old Testament, the
[48:38] very last books in the Hebrew Bible are
[48:40] 1 and 2 Chronicles because they were the
[48:42] very last books that were written that
[48:44] are included in that text.
[48:49] When you read not just the accounts and
[48:51] chronicles, but see which events are
[48:53] recorded and which are left out, you can
[48:55] see a very clear pattern used by the
[48:58] ones who compiled and edited those
[49:00] manuscripts. Keep in mind, these are not
[49:03] books written by prophets, but histories
[49:06] recorded by various scribes, likely
[49:08] officials in the king's courts.
[49:11] Well, you may be thinking, "Okay,
[49:14] brother." So, if you're not, just going
[49:16] to sort of read and comment like last
[49:18] time. How will we pursue this
[49:21] study? Here's the approach I'd like us
[49:24] to try. If it doesn't work, we'll find
[49:26] another one. Always subject to change.
[49:30] Tonight, we'll step back. We'll take an
[49:33] overview of David's early life in more
[49:35] or less chronological order. Uh, I say
[49:37] more or less because the stories of his
[49:39] life are not all presented in order.
[49:42] There are many flashbacks, many flash
[49:45] forwards. An obvious example is that
[49:47] after we're told David has died, we're
[49:50] then told of several events of his life
[49:51] not previously
[49:53] mentioned. I don't think he came back to
[49:55] do those things. I think they just
[49:57] happened in an earlier time. So, these
[49:58] are flashbacks.
[50:00] And the people that wrote the Bible
[50:03] weren't concerned about specific orders
[50:05] of of events. They were concerned about
[50:08] finishing a thread of thought and then
[50:09] moving on to the next thread, moving on
[50:11] to the next
[50:15] lesson. After the context, an overview
[50:18] of David's early life up to the death of
[50:20] King Saul, we'll examine some of the
[50:22] events in closer detail. First from a
[50:25] narrative perspective reading from the
[50:27] books of Samuel, Kings andor Chronicles.
[50:31] Next we'll look at his heart at that
[50:33] particular time in his life through one
[50:36] or more of the psalms that he wrote and
[50:39] specifically identified with that part
[50:42] of his life. So with the Lord's help and
[50:46] with your extreme patience, we'll see
[50:49] not only David's heart, but God's heart
[50:51] for us and how we can apply the lessons
[50:55] of David to our lives
[50:58] today. To begin, you know me by
[51:03] now. I always find it helpful to
[51:05] establish overall context to set the
[51:07] stage for the story. When did David
[51:10] live? This helps establish the
[51:12] political, economic and technological
[51:15] environments. What about the geography?
[51:18] Where did these events take place? What
[51:21] sort of neighbors did they have? Was the
[51:24] kingdom isolated like Egypt with
[51:25] tremendous natural barriers to proford
[51:28] protection to afford protection or or
[51:30] not? Let's start by figuring out the
[51:35] time in which David lived.
[51:40] You might recognize this slide from
[51:42] before. Yeah, I see you've got your your
[51:46] binoculars up there, Sister Martha. Good
[51:48] for you. Good for you. Somebody was
[51:50] paying
[51:51] attention. As you may recall from our
[51:53] earlier study of Joseph, the oldest time
[51:56] anchors between the Bible and secular
[51:58] history is Egypt's invasion of Judah
[52:00] during the reign of Rahoboam, David's
[52:03] grandson. From this we know the year
[52:05] Solomon, David's son by Bath Sheba,
[52:08] became king, which is the same year that
[52:10] David died, which is
[52:12] about 970
[52:17] BC. In 2 Samuel
[52:21] 5:4, we're told that David was 30 years
[52:24] old when he began to reign and he
[52:27] reigned 40 years. So from this, we see
[52:30] David was born about 1040 BC. He became
[52:33] king about 1010 BC and died about 970
[52:38] BC. He lived some 70 or 71
[52:43] years. Here I've indicated a few of the
[52:46] major events of his life. It' be
[52:48] difficult to see if I added more.
[52:50] Hopefully that's not too difficult with
[52:52] those
[52:53] few. Most of the time we can only guess
[52:56] it at his age. And in fact, the exact
[52:58] sequence of many of the events of his
[53:00] life is often not clear.
[53:02] But what technology existed at that
[53:05] time, particularly in reference to
[53:07] warfare? War seems to play a major role
[53:10] in the stories of David's
[53:12] life. 100 BC was at the end of what is
[53:16] known as the Bronze Age. That's
[53:18] generally considered from about 3000 BC
[53:20] to 1,000 BC. Don't go to sleep on me
[53:22] yet, please. Bronze is an alloy of
[53:25] copper and tin. It was the metal most
[53:27] used for tools and weapons. It was easy
[53:29] to work with and you could build a fire
[53:31] hot enough to do something with it. The
[53:34] Iron Age, where the superior qualities
[53:37] of iron over bronze were recognized and
[53:40] used for most purposes, was from about
[53:43] 1300 BC to about 1,000 BC. And after
[53:46] that point, we don't talk about
[53:47] different metals of ages. This is not
[53:49] the titanium age or the or the carbon
[53:52] fiber age or whatever.
[53:55] Iron was known and used earlier than
[53:57] 1300 BC. But this period is when its use
[54:00] became widespread. Now when you read in
[54:03] Joshua and the very first part of Judges
[54:06] about the difficulties that the
[54:08] Israelites had with the Canaanites,
[54:10] you'll notice one reason given for not
[54:13] being able to conquer them had to do
[54:15] with the Canaanites and Philistines
[54:17] possessing iron
[54:18] technology. Israel did not. Judges 1:19.
[54:24] And the Lord was with Judah, and he
[54:26] drove out the inhabitants of the
[54:28] mountain, but could not drive out the
[54:31] inhabitants of the valley because they
[54:34] had chariots of
[54:35] iron. It doesn't mean that they were
[54:38] solid iron chariots. They were wooden
[54:40] chariots, but they were reinforced with
[54:41] iron in the right places.
[54:43] Israelites had no chariots. They didn't
[54:47] even have war horses. They just spent 40
[54:49] years crossing the desert, living on
[54:52] mana.
[54:54] This is about 1400 BC about 350 years
[54:57] before David's birth. So we see that
[55:00] this technology certainly had an
[55:03] impact. The result was that Israel under
[55:07] Joshua conquered and occupied the
[55:09] central mountainous region of Canaan,
[55:12] the Jordan Valley in the hill country
[55:13] east of the Jordan Valley. Further east
[55:16] was desert. And I know this is hard to
[55:18] see and and and Barth is probably not
[55:21] going to share her binoculars with
[55:23] everybody. So these this is mountain is
[55:25] here. Here's the Dead Sea, the Jordan
[55:27] River. Uh the Sea of Galilee as we call
[55:31] it. The Med is out here. Here's modern
[55:34] day Tel Aviv. Here's Jerusalem. Uh but
[55:37] you can see this is all
[55:39] mountainous. And along the coast, the
[55:42] plains they didn't conquer. They
[55:44] conquered the green area.
[55:49] So, Israel had begun as a loose
[55:52] confederation of tribal agricultural
[55:55] communities. They'd been under
[55:57] subjection by these coastal powers,
[55:59] which we usually refer to loosely as the
[56:05] Philistines. As a result of constant
[56:09] harassment and subjugation by their
[56:11] neighbors for these 350 or 400 years,
[56:15] the tribes united under a king. They
[56:17] said, "This is not working. We need a
[56:20] king." The prophet Samuel anointed Saul,
[56:25] a man of Benjamin, as
[56:28] king. Saul was not looking to be
[56:31] selected as king. He was shocked when
[56:34] Samuel came to him. I'm sure that
[56:36] brother Daniel will uh make that very
[56:39] clear. Israel became much stronger
[56:41] militarily, but in spite of regular
[56:44] warfare with its neighbors, the
[56:45] territory controlled by Israel, though
[56:47] consolidated under one government,
[56:49] remained essentially the same. So you'll
[56:52] see here in this map the the little
[56:54] brown outline that's showing the borders
[56:56] of Saul's kingdom. And you'll see that
[56:59] it's essentially the same as the area
[57:02] that was initially conquered. They
[57:03] filled in most of this spot right here.
[57:06] And
[57:07] uh that's pretty much what they filled
[57:09] in. Uh up here there's this little town.
[57:12] You can't read it. It's Bet Sheen. They
[57:14] didn't conquer that. That was still
[57:16] unconquered territory. That's why
[57:18] it's Don't look straight into it, Ly.
[57:20] There we go. Wrong button. Wrong button.
[57:24] Wrong button. Okay. Take my word for it.
[57:28] Over here in the upper part is Bet
[57:30] Shion. down here. The other little
[57:32] circle is Jerusalem. They didn't conquer
[57:34] that
[57:38] either.
[57:41] Okay. This map shows the approximate
[57:44] distribution of the regional powers that
[57:46] were emerging in David's time as well as
[57:49] the overall geography of the region.
[57:51] I've marked the location of Israel with
[57:53] a star of David. To the west there was
[57:57] the Mediterranean Sea.
[58:00] To the southeast the Arabian desert.
[58:02] Both of these provided
[58:03] protection. To the southwest was Egypt,
[58:07] a superpower of the era. To the north
[58:09] were the Hittites. Across the desert to
[58:11] the east where it would says Elam and
[58:13] Mesopotamia. That Mesopotamia became
[58:16] Babylon. Elam became Persia. And they
[58:18] were the people that four and 500 years
[58:20] after David conquered Israel.
[58:25] Israel lies at the junction of
[58:29] Europe, Asia, and
[58:32] Africa. As such, it would be an
[58:34] important transit for the armies
[58:36] battling for dominance of their growing
[58:39] empires. They didn't much care about
[58:41] Israel
[58:42] itself. Some farmers and some hills were
[58:45] not too worried about them, but they
[58:46] care very
[58:47] much about the location. They were real
[58:51] estate guys. location, location,
[58:53] location. And as a result, there was a
[58:57] lot of traffic of unfriendly people
[58:59] going through Israel.
[59:02] Well, we now have a context of when the
[59:04] sort of technology that existed and was
[59:07] developing, the geographic location and
[59:09] its importance and the sorts of near and
[59:11] approaching neighbors with whom the
[59:13] nation
[59:14] lived, and that Israel had demanded and
[59:18] received into power its first king, Saul
[59:21] of
[59:23] Benjamin. It's worth noting that when
[59:25] Samuel told Saul he would be king, Saul
[59:27] was shocked and very
[59:29] humble.
[59:31] Excuse me. Later, jealousy and pride
[59:35] will be his
[59:41] downfall. There's that word
[59:44] again.
[59:46] Pride specifically states in the Bible
[59:49] that that was it. Let's follow the
[59:52] thread of David's early life through the
[59:54] Bible. Again, laying
[59:57] background. Pardon me.
[1:00:00] This will be by means of brief chapter
[1:00:02] summaries like we did last year with our
[1:00:04] overview of the Old Testament
[1:00:06] books. Bear with me through this. It'll
[1:00:08] take about 10 minutes, but it'll set the
[1:00:11] stage of the big picture from high
[1:00:14] altitude of David's life before we zoom
[1:00:18] in. In 1 Samuel chapter 9, Saul is
[1:00:22] chosen by the Lord to be king. In
[1:00:24] chapter 10, he's anointed to be king by
[1:00:27] the prophet Samuel and proclaimed as
[1:00:30] Israel's king, though not everybody was
[1:00:32] happy about Saul being selected. We're
[1:00:34] told he was head and shoulders taller
[1:00:36] than any of the
[1:00:37] people. Saul establishes capital at
[1:00:40] Gibia, circled in
[1:00:42] red. In chapter 11, he gathers an army,
[1:00:45] defeats the Ammonites at a place called
[1:00:47] Yabesh Gilead, which is just north of
[1:00:49] this map.
[1:00:52] The people who were opposed to Saul now
[1:00:54] step up and say, "We were we were for
[1:00:56] you all the time. We were just kidding."
[1:00:58] The kingdom is renewed by Samuel at
[1:01:01] Gilgal circled in yellow on the
[1:01:03] map. Note that Jerusalem is circled in
[1:01:07] brown. It's it's in the middle there.
[1:01:09] That marks the borders of Saul's
[1:01:10] kingdom. Jerusalem is not yet part of
[1:01:12] Israel. During Saul's time, Jerusalem
[1:01:15] was not part of the kingdom. They were
[1:01:17] independent. the
[1:01:19] Jebusites. They won't be conquered until
[1:01:22] David becomes
[1:01:24] king. Chapter 12 is Samuel's farewell
[1:01:28] address to Israel, warning of one, the
[1:01:30] consequences of disobedience, and two,
[1:01:33] providing assurances to Israel if they
[1:01:36] will be obedient to the commandments of
[1:01:38] the Lord.
[1:01:41] Chapter 13 tells of a battle with the
[1:01:43] Philistines near Giba, of Saul's
[1:01:46] impatience waiting for Samuel at Gilgal
[1:01:49] and offering a sacrifice. Chapter 14
[1:01:53] tells of more battles and of Saul's
[1:01:56] what's the word that chapter 14 uses?
[1:01:59] Pride. Yes. What does pride precede?
[1:02:03] Let's
[1:02:04] see. Chapter 15. Saul battles the
[1:02:07] Amalachites. is told to destroy them and
[1:02:10] tells of Saul's incomplete obedience.
[1:02:13] Like so many of these events, the
[1:02:15] showdown between Samuel and Saul takes
[1:02:18] place in that little yellow circle place
[1:02:20] called Gilgal. 1st Samuel 15:22. We
[1:02:26] read, "And Samuel said, am I speaking
[1:02:29] loud enough, brother? I'm okay.
[1:02:32] I'm I'm trying to uh control recovery
[1:02:35] here." And Samuel said, "Hath the Lord
[1:02:38] as great delight in burnt offerings and
[1:02:41] sacrifices? As in obeying the voice of
[1:02:44] the Lord?
[1:02:47] Behold, to obey is better than
[1:02:50] sacrifice." Sacrifice is a form of
[1:02:53] worship. To obey is better, and to
[1:02:56] hearken, to listen than the fat of rams.
[1:03:01] For
[1:03:01] rebellion is as a sin of
[1:03:05] witchcraft.
[1:03:06] Stubbornness is as
[1:03:09] iniquity and
[1:03:12] idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the
[1:03:15] word of the Lord, he hath also rejected
[1:03:18] thee from being
[1:03:21] king. Incomplete obedience. Convincing
[1:03:26] yourself this is my interpretation and
[1:03:28] I'm doing it right by my interpretation.
[1:03:30] But it's not what the Lord
[1:03:32] said. Saul will still have 10 or 15 more
[1:03:35] years of his reign
[1:03:39] remaining. Chapter 16, Samuel goes to
[1:03:41] Bethlehem, circled in yellow, to see
[1:03:44] Jesse, who God indicates has a son, who
[1:03:46] will succeed Saul as king. God tells
[1:03:50] Samuel, "Don't look at the stature or
[1:03:52] appearances a man looks. God looks at
[1:03:54] the heart."
[1:03:55] Samuel anoints Jesse's youngest son,
[1:03:58] David, to be Israel's future
[1:04:01] king. In the latter part of the
[1:04:03] chapter, not necessarily in
[1:04:06] chronological sequence with other
[1:04:08] chapters, God sends an evil spirit to
[1:04:10] trouble Saul. Saul is told of and then
[1:04:13] sends for David, the son of Jesse,
[1:04:15] described as a man of war, to come to
[1:04:18] Saul and play music on his harp. And
[1:04:21] music refreshes Saul. The evil spirit
[1:04:25] departs. This is a recurring
[1:04:30] pattern. These were not harps like you'd
[1:04:33] see in a modern orchestra or something.
[1:04:35] This is a small handmade instrument. You
[1:04:38] see here a couple of one fairly old and
[1:04:40] another one that a replica that somebody
[1:04:42] made of. What it may have looked like.
[1:04:44] We don't really know. Nothing nothing
[1:04:46] has survived from that era or that
[1:04:49] period. In chapter 17, a young David
[1:04:52] fights and defeats Goliath, the
[1:04:54] Philistine champion. Probably the most
[1:04:57] famous story of
[1:04:59] David. Our title slide is a portion of a
[1:05:03] statue of David with his sling sculpted
[1:05:05] by Michelangelo about 520 years
[1:05:09] ago. Starting with chapter 18, Saul
[1:05:13] becomes jealous of David, tries to kill
[1:05:16] him with ever greater hostility as time
[1:05:19] passes. When David plays music to soothe
[1:05:22] Saul, Saul tries to kill him by throwing
[1:05:24] a spear at
[1:05:25] David. He then makes David a minor
[1:05:28] commander in the army. Maybe I can get
[1:05:29] rid of him that way. Then he tells
[1:05:32] David, "If you can kill a hundred
[1:05:34] Philistine men and bring me irrefutable
[1:05:37] evidence, David will then be given the
[1:05:39] hand of Saul's daughter in marriage."
[1:05:41] Saul expected the Philistines to kill
[1:05:44] David. Instead, David and his men killed
[1:05:47] 200 Philistines instead of only 100. And
[1:05:50] David marries Saul's daughter, Michael.
[1:05:53] And we're told that Michael very much
[1:05:56] loved
[1:05:58] David. Chapter 19 is more war, more
[1:06:01] efforts to kill David. In this chapter,
[1:06:03] Michael saves David's life. The Lord
[1:06:06] protects David through Samuel in a very
[1:06:08] unusual way.
[1:06:11] After this event, David will remain a
[1:06:13] fugitive until Saul's
[1:06:16] death. In chapter 20, David comes to V's
[1:06:19] friend Jonathan, the crown prince,
[1:06:22] trying to understand, why is your dad
[1:06:24] trying to kill me? Jonathan verifies
[1:06:27] that Saul is determined to kill David
[1:06:28] and warns him, stay
[1:06:35] away. In chapter 21, David goes to Knob
[1:06:39] circled in yellow. You can see it's not
[1:06:41] very far
[1:06:42] away. Couple miles, three miles maybe.
[1:06:45] And there is an event where he eats shoe
[1:06:48] bread from the altar. Jesus talks about
[1:06:50] that. In fear of Saul, David then flees
[1:06:54] to the Philistine city of Gath circled
[1:06:56] in red. He is then in fear of Akish, the
[1:07:00] ruler of Gath, and prescends. He's out
[1:07:03] of his mind to escape. In chapter 22, he
[1:07:07] flees to Moab, shown by the red arrow.
[1:07:10] And after hiding out for a time, returns
[1:07:12] to Judah, and hides in a forest.
[1:07:16] Meanwhile, Saul hears that David had
[1:07:18] gone to the priest at Knob, which we're
[1:07:20] told this is a city of priests, and Saul
[1:07:23] has the entire population of the city
[1:07:25] slaughtered.
[1:07:30] Chapter 23. The Lord tells David to
[1:07:32] rescue Keelia, circled in yellow, from
[1:07:35] the Philistines. He does, but is warned
[1:07:37] the Keelites will turn him over to Saul.
[1:07:39] So, he flees to the wilderness, Nema,
[1:07:41] circled in red. Saul chases him, but
[1:07:45] then is called away to fight yet another
[1:07:47] battle with the Philistines. David then
[1:07:49] moves to the caves of Denghetti by the
[1:07:51] Dead Sea, circled in black, not so far
[1:07:56] away from where the Dead Sea Scrolls
[1:07:58] were eventually
[1:08:00] found. This photo shows a present- day
[1:08:03] nature reserve at Engeti. The inset
[1:08:06] shows us sorts of caves that are all
[1:08:08] over the area. There's water available,
[1:08:11] but not from the Dead Sea. Can't drink
[1:08:13] that stuff. You can see this as a remote
[1:08:16] and forbidding place, especially if in
[1:08:19] your mind's eye you remove the paved
[1:08:21] roads and irrigated fields and various
[1:08:23] buildings in the present day
[1:08:28] site. Just for give you an idea, the the
[1:08:32] sea level there is about 1300 feet below
[1:08:34] sea level. The top of the rocks
[1:08:38] there are slightly above sea level. So
[1:08:42] it's about a 1500 foot difference in
[1:08:44] elevation there. Not so different from
[1:08:47] the difference in elevation from Tucson
[1:08:49] at about 2500 feet and the peaks of some
[1:08:52] of the Tucson mountains here at about
[1:08:55] 4,000. In chapter 24, Saul ends up
[1:08:58] sheltering in the same cave at In Getty
[1:09:01] where David is
[1:09:03] hiding.
[1:09:05] Saul David spares Saul, provides him
[1:09:07] with evidence that he could have killed
[1:09:09] him. Saul gets David to agree that when
[1:09:11] he becomes king, he will not kill Saul's
[1:09:14] descendants. Chapter 25, Samuel dies.
[1:09:18] David and his men, meanwhile, are camped
[1:09:21] out uh at some property owned by a
[1:09:24] fellow named Nabal. Nabalu, they don't
[1:09:27] get along so well with David, and he
[1:09:28] dies, but David had nothing to do with
[1:09:30] that. David marries his widow, Abigail,
[1:09:33] and about the same time marries a Hinam
[1:09:36] of Jezriel.
[1:09:38] Michael, David's wife, who protected him
[1:09:40] from Saul, had been taken by Saul and
[1:09:43] given to another
[1:09:45] man. Chapter 26, David again comes upon
[1:09:50] Saul, who is sleeping, again, refuses to
[1:09:52] harm him, but takes his spear as
[1:09:54] evidence he could have. They again part
[1:10:01] ways. Chapter 27. David tires of fleeing
[1:10:04] from Saul and decides to go and live
[1:10:07] among the Philistines, knowing that Saul
[1:10:09] won't pursue him in the enemy
[1:10:12] territory. Again, he goes to Gath,
[1:10:15] circled in red. This time, he's not
[1:10:17] afraid of Akish, and he's allowed to
[1:10:19] settle among the Philistines in the town
[1:10:21] of Ziglag, circled in
[1:10:24] yellow, just for fun and to demonstrate
[1:10:27] how small this place really is.
[1:10:33] and drawn an arrow from the coast at
[1:10:35] Ashdod down to Engeti at the border of
[1:10:37] the Dead Sea. That distance is about the
[1:10:40] same or greater than the distance from
[1:10:42] the Jordan River to the Mediterranean
[1:10:44] along most of the nation of Israel.
[1:10:46] Anybody care to guess how long that
[1:10:48] arrow
[1:10:51] is? I think they're afraid I'm going to
[1:10:53] yell at him or something. They get it
[1:10:55] wrong. It's It's not a test.
[1:11:00] Well, it's more than one mile. Yeah. 10.
[1:11:03] It's it's it's actually 50
[1:11:06] miles. So, if you left from here and and
[1:11:09] got on I 10 and went towards Phoenix,
[1:11:12] when you get to when you get to uh uh
[1:11:16] Eloy, you've gone to 50 miles. Or if
[1:11:18] you're going to go visit Sister Hope and
[1:11:21] you get to Benson, you've gone about 50
[1:11:23] miles. Or if you're going to stay on
[1:11:25] Oracle Road and go up Highway 87, you
[1:11:27] get to about Dudleyville.
[1:11:29] I'm sure you wanted to know
[1:11:32] that. Chapter 28. Saul is faced with
[1:11:36] another battle with the Philistines. In
[1:11:37] the north, there are mount Gilboa
[1:11:39] circled in
[1:11:42] red. He wants the Lord's will, his
[1:11:45] guidance. To me, Saul is just such a
[1:11:48] tragic character. Samuel is dead. The Um
[1:11:53] doesn't answer. They they were supposed
[1:11:55] to go to the priests and they had the
[1:11:56] arm and if the lights would flash they'd
[1:11:58] know what the Lord was telling them. He
[1:12:00] tried to do the right
[1:12:02] things. No answer. The prophets, no
[1:12:06] answer. In
[1:12:08] desperation, Saul consults a medium,
[1:12:11] sometimes called a witch at Endor. She
[1:12:13] somehow connects with the dead prophet
[1:12:15] Samuel, who tells Saul he and his sons
[1:12:18] would be killed the next day in battle
[1:12:19] with the
[1:12:21] Philistines. Chapter 29. The Philistine
[1:12:24] lords tell Akish, "We don't trust David.
[1:12:27] We don't want him up here. We're going
[1:12:28] to be fighting against his people. So,
[1:12:30] he must return to their land while they
[1:12:32] go to fight against
[1:12:34] Saul." So, in chapter 30, David returns
[1:12:38] to Ziglag, circled in yellow, his city
[1:12:40] there. It's a three days journey
[1:12:43] about, and he finds the Malachites have
[1:12:45] attacked and burnt the city, taken the
[1:12:47] women captive, including David's wives
[1:12:49] and all the children.
[1:12:51] David dramatically rescues
[1:12:54] them. Chapter 31. Saul and the Israelite
[1:12:58] forces are defeated by the Philistines
[1:12:59] at Mount Gilboa up there in red. Saul's
[1:13:03] body and the bodies of his sons are hung
[1:13:05] on the wall of Betshienne. Remember I
[1:13:07] pointed out Betian was a tiny area that
[1:13:10] had not been conquered by them. It was a
[1:13:11] stronghold to the enemy. In a daring
[1:13:14] raid, the bodies are removed by the men
[1:13:16] of Yabesh Gilead and buried there,
[1:13:19] circled in
[1:13:21] blue. Now, a parallel account of the
[1:13:24] death of Saul is found in 1 Chronicles
[1:13:27] chapter 10. That's the only mention of
[1:13:29] any kingdom in Israel prior to David in
[1:13:32] Chronicles is that one chapter and it
[1:13:35] deals with this particular thing.
[1:13:37] Chapter 31 concludes the book of 1
[1:13:40] Samuel. Originally, I thought to
[1:13:42] continue this overview, get all the way
[1:13:45] to the end of David's life, and then dig
[1:13:46] into some of the specifics in the
[1:13:48] related Psalms,
[1:13:49] but I thought this is Bible study, not a
[1:13:54] context study with brief chapter
[1:13:55] summaries. We're at a good point to
[1:13:57] pause the summary at the death of Saul.
[1:14:00] David's now on the threshold of becoming
[1:14:02] king of a portion of Israel. He'll be
[1:14:05] crowned at age 30, so it's near the
[1:14:07] middle of his life.
[1:14:10] Well, during these early years of his
[1:14:12] life or or maybe reflecting on them
[1:14:14] later, David wrote eight specific psalms
[1:14:17] that those are psalms that mentioned
[1:14:20] they are specifically associated with
[1:14:22] this event in his
[1:14:25] life. Before we look at any of those
[1:14:27] psalms though, we need one more bit of
[1:14:29] background, one more angle of
[1:14:31] perspective. We get it from the New
[1:14:34] Testament. When Paul was recounting some
[1:14:37] of the heroes of faith in Hebrews chap
[1:14:39] 11, he wrote verse 32, "And what shall I
[1:14:44] say more? For the time would fail to
[1:14:47] tell me of
[1:14:49] Gideon hiding from the Philistines to
[1:14:51] thresh a little grain from his family,
[1:14:54] and of Bareric, who refused to do
[1:14:56] anything without Deborah accompanying
[1:14:58] him, and of Samson and his diance with
[1:15:02] Delilah. and of Jeepa whose vow cost his
[1:15:06] daughter her life. Paul's telling us to
[1:15:09] stop looking at the weaknesses we all
[1:15:12] possess. That's not what this is
[1:15:15] about. God looks beyond our flaws. He
[1:15:19] looks for something else. That something
[1:15:22] else is a gift he alone can give.
[1:15:27] He goes on and says of David also and
[1:15:31] Samuel the prophets. I've highlighted
[1:15:32] David in yellow here and the
[1:15:34] descriptions and some of the following
[1:15:36] verses that apply to David's life who
[1:15:40] through their cleverness and
[1:15:43] skill through their knowledge of
[1:15:47] doctrine political
[1:15:49] connections wealth. No, through their
[1:15:53] faith.
[1:15:54] through their faith, subdued
[1:15:57] kingdoms, wrought
[1:15:59] righteousness, obtained
[1:16:02] promises, stopped the mouths of lions. I
[1:16:06] used to think of Daniel when I read that
[1:16:08] line, but David when he's going to take
[1:16:10] on Goliath as me and my sling, lion,
[1:16:16] bear, quenched the violence of fire,
[1:16:19] escaped the edge of the sword.
[1:16:22] out of weakness were made strong, waxed
[1:16:26] valiant in fight, turned to flight the
[1:16:30] armies of the
[1:16:31] aliens. Skipping to verse 38, of whom
[1:16:34] the world was not
[1:16:35] worthy. They wandered in deserts and
[1:16:38] mountains and dens and caves of the
[1:16:41] earth. I never thought of David in that
[1:16:43] context till I was reading this the
[1:16:45] other day. We just read in the summaries
[1:16:47] where he hid in the forest, he hid in
[1:16:49] the
[1:16:50] caves. And these all having obtained a
[1:16:54] good report through not their merits but
[1:16:59] through the gift God gave them their
[1:17:01] faith received not the promise. God
[1:17:05] having provided some better thing
[1:17:07] for for who?
[1:17:10] for us that they without
[1:17:14] us should not be made complete, should
[1:17:18] not be made
[1:17:20] perfect. Faith is a gift, brother Lyall.
[1:17:23] Yeah. Yeah. Ephesians 2, Paul tells us,
[1:17:25] "For by grace are you saved through
[1:17:28] faith, and that not of yourselves, it is
[1:17:32] what? The gift of
[1:17:35] God." Why? Not of works, lest any man
[1:17:40] should
[1:17:41] boast. It's a gift. God is sovereign. We
[1:17:46] are not. It's only our pride or
[1:17:49] arrogance that suggests that we
[1:17:52] are. Now, let's look at some specific
[1:17:56] events in David's
[1:17:58] life. at his anointing by Samuel. We
[1:18:01] read
[1:18:05] in 1st Samuel 16 verse
[1:18:09] 11. Samuel said unto Jesse, "Are here
[1:18:13] all thy children?" And he said, "Well,
[1:18:16] there remainth yet the youngest, and
[1:18:18] he's out keeping the
[1:18:20] sheep." Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and
[1:18:23] fetch him. Will not sit down till he
[1:18:25] come hither."
[1:18:27] And Jesse sent and brought David in. Now
[1:18:30] he was ready. That means he had a
[1:18:32] reddish complexion and with all of the
[1:18:35] beautiful countenance, literally with
[1:18:37] fine eyes and goodly to look to. He was
[1:18:40] a handsome young man. And the Lord said,
[1:18:44] "Arise, anoint him, for this is he."
[1:18:49] Then Samuel took the horn of oil and
[1:18:51] anointed him in the midst of his
[1:18:53] brethren. And the spirit of the Lord
[1:18:56] came upon David. Other translations many
[1:18:58] say that spirit of the Lord fell upon
[1:19:00] David with power from that day
[1:19:05] forward. So Samuel rose up and went to
[1:19:08] his home in
[1:19:15] Rama. From this and other statements, we
[1:19:18] know that David's background was as a
[1:19:20] shepherd. He looked after, cared for his
[1:19:23] flock. Jesus likened himself as the good
[1:19:26] shepherd. From that
[1:19:28] perspective, David worshiped the Lord
[1:19:31] with the song he wrote, one with which
[1:19:33] we're all familiar. It was not written
[1:19:35] after or associated with any particular
[1:19:38] event, but from his background as a
[1:19:41] shepherd. Turn your Bibles if you wish
[1:19:44] to the book of Psalms number 23. You
[1:19:47] probably can recite it without even
[1:19:49] looking. We used to have himnels in the
[1:19:52] pockets in the back of what we used to
[1:19:55] have
[1:19:56] pews. The word translated as psalm
[1:19:59] literally means a
[1:20:02] melody. The psalms are songs. They're
[1:20:05] meant to be sung or chanted. The book of
[1:20:09] psalms then is literally a song book.
[1:20:12] And David didn't write all of it. They
[1:20:14] were written over a period. Moses wrote
[1:20:17] one of them that was 500 years before
[1:20:21] David and the last ones were about 500
[1:20:23] years after David. So they were written
[1:20:24] over a period of about a thousand
[1:20:27] years. But David wrote a lot of them. In
[1:20:31] ancient times, people didn't have books.
[1:20:33] Scrolls were made by hand and very
[1:20:36] expensive. They didn't even have screens
[1:20:38] and
[1:20:39] projectors. Literacy was not widespread.
[1:20:43] The songs were memorized. They weren't
[1:20:46] recited. They were sung.
[1:20:52] Psalm 23. I know we're all familiar with
[1:20:55] this. A psalm, a melody of
[1:20:58] David. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
[1:21:02] not want. Now, when I was a
[1:21:04] kid, I read this and I thought David was
[1:21:07] saying, "The Lord is my shepherd, but I
[1:21:09] don't want
[1:21:11] him." That's how my brain worked back
[1:21:14] then. Hopefully, the Lord has healed me
[1:21:16] from that.
[1:21:17] He maketh me to lie down in green
[1:21:20] pastures. He leadth me beside the still
[1:21:22] waters. And I
[1:21:23] thought sheep have to stand up to
[1:21:26] eat. He's making them lie down in their
[1:21:29] food and not letting them eat and making
[1:21:31] them drink stagnant water. Why does he
[1:21:34] treat them this way? I'm glad I'm a
[1:21:36] human and not a
[1:21:37] sheep. Well, when I was a child, I
[1:21:40] fought as a child. I did as a child. But
[1:21:42] when I became a man, I put away childish
[1:21:44] things. So let's let's start
[1:21:47] over. A psalm of David. The Lord is my
[1:21:50] shepherd. He looks after me, protects
[1:21:53] me, takes the best possible care of me
[1:21:56] that he can. As a result, I shall not
[1:21:59] want or lack for anything,
[1:22:02] for anything which I need. If if I think
[1:22:05] I lack something, he knows what I need
[1:22:08] better than I do. He makes me to lie
[1:22:12] down in green pastures. She grants
[1:22:13] peaceful
[1:22:15] rest in a context that reminds me all is
[1:22:19] well. He leads me beside the still
[1:22:22] waters. Not stormy, churning, muddy,
[1:22:25] polluted, dangerous, but good, clean,
[1:22:28] bacteriarefree, pure water. Jesus said
[1:22:31] he'd give us water that would quench our
[1:22:33] thirst
[1:22:37] forever. He restores my soul. He
[1:22:40] comforts me when I'm stressed or in
[1:22:42] distress. He leads me. He shows me the
[1:22:46] way is safe. He doesn't send me. He goes
[1:22:48] before
[1:22:50] me in the paths of righteousness,
[1:22:53] guiding and helping me to be in right
[1:22:55] relationship with him. Why? Because I'm
[1:23:00] so smart, strong, clever, wise. No. In
[1:23:04] the end, it's all about him. It's not
[1:23:07] about me. He does it for his name's
[1:23:12] sake. Reading that I I
[1:23:14] thought back in the 50s from 53 to 61,
[1:23:18] the the president of the United States
[1:23:20] was Dwight David
[1:23:22] Eisenhower. He used to keep a lengthy
[1:23:24] keychain on his desk. When asked about
[1:23:27] it, he said words to this effect. It's a
[1:23:29] reminder of leadership. You can't push
[1:23:32] the chain from behind. It just gets
[1:23:34] tangled up. You have to lead it and it
[1:23:37] will follow.
[1:23:40] He leadth me in the paths of
[1:23:43] righteousness. Yay, though I walk
[1:23:45] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:23:47] death, will all eventually walk through
[1:23:49] that valley, I will fear no evil, even
[1:23:53] if I know it's present, near, trying to
[1:23:56] snatch me. And why am I
[1:24:00] calm? For thou, my Lord, my shepherd,
[1:24:04] you're with me. Your rod and your staff,
[1:24:08] they guide and protect and comfort me.
[1:24:12] Thou preparest a table before me. You
[1:24:14] take care of me even when I'm in the
[1:24:15] presence of my enemies. You anoint my
[1:24:18] head with oil. My cup runs over. Lord,
[1:24:22] you truly are all we need regardless of
[1:24:26] the circumstances. As a result of my
[1:24:29] life experiences with you and what your
[1:24:31] word tells me, and you confirm in my
[1:24:34] heart by your
[1:24:35] spirit, I have confidence that surely
[1:24:39] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:24:43] the days of my life. And after my life
[1:24:47] ends here on earth, I will dwell in the
[1:24:50] house. I will forever be a part of the
[1:24:53] family of the Lord forever.
[1:24:57] David knew what it meant to be a
[1:25:01] shepherd. He viewed the Lord and his
[1:25:04] relationship to the Lord in that light,
[1:25:06] that perspective, that that training the
[1:25:09] Lord was giving him for his future
[1:25:11] work. Now, his his relationship with the
[1:25:15] Lord was not only from the perspective
[1:25:17] of his shepherd, but it
[1:25:19] included that role as an aspect of the
[1:25:22] relationship.
[1:25:23] In the early part of our marriage,
[1:25:24] Heather and I traveled to New Zealand,
[1:25:26] and we were privileged to stay with
[1:25:28] Brother Reg
[1:25:31] Surl. He would often remind
[1:25:34] us, "A sheep does not have to work at
[1:25:37] bearing wool. It bears wool because it's
[1:25:40] a sheep, not because it's trying to be a
[1:25:44] sheep." He had apple trees in his yard.
[1:25:47] He'd point out, "An apple tree bears
[1:25:49] apples because it's an apple tree."
[1:25:52] Apple trees don't fight if you pick an
[1:25:54] apple. Neither do sheep fight when
[1:25:57] they're shown their wool. They just keep
[1:25:59] bearing
[1:26:00] wool. When our oldest son and his family
[1:26:03] lived in Christ Church, New Zealand in
[1:26:05] the late 90s and early 2000s, they
[1:26:08] attended a church whose pastor, Brother
[1:26:10] Greg Alfred, had been a shepherd for
[1:26:12] many years before the Lord called him
[1:26:14] into ministry. You can see the impact of
[1:26:17] that background in his approach to
[1:26:18] shephering people in his church. kind,
[1:26:22] gentle yet firm. Teaching, affirming, a
[1:26:26] ministry of reaching out and
[1:26:29] understanding, forming community within
[1:26:31] the congregation, and as a congregation,
[1:26:34] reaching out to the local
[1:26:37] community. We may come back to the
[1:26:40] training God provided for David as a
[1:26:41] shepherd in a later part of this series.
[1:26:47] But getting back to David, you might
[1:26:50] wonder, well, brother Ly, if we're going
[1:26:51] to be picking a psalm now that's in the
[1:26:54] earliest part of David's life for which
[1:26:56] there is a psalm identified with an
[1:26:59] event, what might that event
[1:27:02] be? His anointing to be king by
[1:27:05] Samuel, killing a lion or a bear,
[1:27:08] attacking his father's
[1:27:10] sheep, playing music to soothe Saul.
[1:27:14] Oh, maybe it's the showdown with
[1:27:18] Goliath.
[1:27:20] No, it's about a trap set for David by
[1:27:25] Saul. Let's read 1st Samuel
[1:27:31] 19. And Saul spake to Jonathan his son,
[1:27:34] and to all his servants that they should
[1:27:37] kill
[1:27:38] David. Jonathan defends David to Saul.
[1:27:41] Skipping to verse six. Saul hearkened
[1:27:43] unto the voice of Jonathan. And Saul
[1:27:46] swore, "As the Lord lives, he shall not
[1:27:50] be
[1:27:51] slain." And Jonathan called David, gave
[1:27:54] him the good news, showed him all these
[1:27:56] things, and Jonathan brought David to
[1:27:59] Saul. And David was in Saul's presence
[1:28:02] as in times
[1:28:03] past. And there was war again. David
[1:28:07] went out, fought with the Philistines,
[1:28:08] and slew them with a great slaughter.
[1:28:10] And the Philistines fled from
[1:28:14] David. And the evil spirit from the Lord
[1:28:17] was upon
[1:28:19] Saul. Evil spirit from the Lord. And he
[1:28:23] sat in his house with his javelin and
[1:28:25] his spear in his hand. And David played
[1:28:28] soothing music for Saul with his hand on
[1:28:31] his
[1:28:32] harp. And Saul sought to smite David
[1:28:36] into the wall with a javelin. David
[1:28:38] slipped away out of Saul's presence as
[1:28:41] the javelin's throne and the javelin
[1:28:45] went right into the wall. David fled,
[1:28:49] escaped to his home. That
[1:28:52] night, Saul also sent messengers. Now,
[1:28:55] sometimes we see messengers and angels
[1:28:57] and so forth, but these are not angels.
[1:29:00] These are
[1:29:00] assassins. Sent messengers unto David's
[1:29:03] house to watch him and to kill him in
[1:29:06] the morning. And Michael, David's wife,
[1:29:10] who loved him, became aware of the plan
[1:29:13] and told David, saying, "David, if thou
[1:29:17] save not thy life tonight, tomorrow
[1:29:20] you're going to be
[1:29:22] killed." So Michael risked her life,
[1:29:26] risked the wrath of her unstable,
[1:29:29] bipolar father, Saul, and she let David
[1:29:34] down through a window. And David went
[1:29:38] and fled and
[1:29:40] escaped. And Michael took an image.
[1:29:43] Other translations say a a household god
[1:29:46] or an idol kind of a thing. And laid it
[1:29:48] in the bed and put a pillow of goat's
[1:29:50] hair for his bolster. His head had a
[1:29:52] pillow and covered it with a cloth. Put
[1:29:54] a bed spread over it. Looked like
[1:29:55] somebody sleeping in the bed. And when
[1:29:58] Saul sent messengers to take David,
[1:30:01] Michael said, "Oh, he can't come right
[1:30:04] now. He's sick.
[1:30:06] Saul sent messengers again to see David,
[1:30:09] saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed
[1:30:10] that I may kill
[1:30:12] him." And when the messengers were come
[1:30:14] in, behold, there was an image in the
[1:30:16] bed and an idol with a pillow of goat's
[1:30:20] hair for its pillow, for its bolster.
[1:30:23] And Saul said unto Michael, "Why hast
[1:30:25] thou deceived me so? And son away mine
[1:30:28] enemy that he's escaped." And Michael
[1:30:30] answered, "Saul, he he said unto me, let
[1:30:33] me go. Why should I kill?" He was going
[1:30:35] to kill me if I didn't find a way for
[1:30:36] him to get out of
[1:30:40] here. So David fled and escaped and came
[1:30:44] to Saul Samuel to Rama and told him all
[1:30:47] that Saul had done to him. And he and
[1:30:49] Samuel went and dwelt in
[1:30:56] Neut. David flees from Giba circled in
[1:31:00] red to Rama circled in yellow.
[1:31:05] Well, what were David's thoughts? What
[1:31:06] was going through his
[1:31:09] mind? What was in his
[1:31:12] heart? He very specifically tells us in
[1:31:15] Psalm number
[1:31:18] 59, Psalm 59, to the chief
[1:31:21] musician
[1:31:23] Baltishkith Mam of David, when Saul sent
[1:31:28] and they watched the house to kill him.
[1:31:30] So, he's identifying this specific
[1:31:32] event. We often skip the introductory
[1:31:34] words in a psalm, but they are part of
[1:31:37] it. I chose this psalm because it
[1:31:40] clearly states it's concerning the time
[1:31:41] Saul sent people to watch David's house
[1:31:43] with the intent to murder him, as we
[1:31:45] just read in 1st Samuel 19. One reason
[1:31:48] that we often skip over these remarks is
[1:31:50] because they're strange words and for
[1:31:52] some reason the translators didn't
[1:31:54] bother to translate those words. What
[1:31:57] does alt mean? Or is that the name of
[1:32:01] the chief musician? What is a m mix m?
[1:32:06] How do you pronounce these anyway? What
[1:32:08] is
[1:32:09] that? Alter is literally not to spoil or
[1:32:13] ruin. Do not destroy. In this case, it's
[1:32:16] taken to mean the title of a song or
[1:32:18] tune familiar at the time this was
[1:32:19] written titled do not destroy. Some
[1:32:22] Bibles may say to the chief musician to
[1:32:25] the tune of do not destroy.
[1:32:29] Mikam literally an inscription. It's
[1:32:32] taken to mean a
[1:32:33] poem. Of course, it loses much of its
[1:32:36] poetic form when translated from Hebrew.
[1:32:38] So, this is telling us that that it's to
[1:32:42] the chief musician to the tune of do not
[1:32:45] destroy as a poem of David.
[1:32:49] The majority of this psalm, the first 15
[1:32:52] verses are David's appeal to the Lord
[1:32:55] and his feelings and desires regarding
[1:32:57] those who are trying to destroy him. The
[1:33:00] last two verses are his response to all
[1:33:02] of this and show not his attitude toward
[1:33:05] his enemies, but his heart toward
[1:33:09] God. Let's read. Deliver me from my
[1:33:13] enemies, oh my God. Defend me. Make me
[1:33:16] safe from them that rise against me.
[1:33:18] Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.
[1:33:20] Save me from men of
[1:33:22] bloodshed. For lo, they lie and wait for
[1:33:25] my life. The mighty are gathered. They
[1:33:28] scheme against me, not for my
[1:33:31] transgression, nor for my sin, oh Lord.
[1:33:34] They run and prepare themselves without
[1:33:36] my
[1:33:37] fault. David declares his innocence that
[1:33:40] would require such treatment, not his
[1:33:43] sinlessness.
[1:33:45] But there's another lesson
[1:33:47] here. His enemies are
[1:33:49] preparing, working with diligence and
[1:33:52] zeal to accomplish their task. I
[1:33:56] sometimes wonder when I look in the
[1:33:59] mirror, which I try not to do very
[1:34:00] often. Do I see zeal or do I instead see
[1:34:05] complacency in the person that's looking
[1:34:08] back at me in the mirror?
[1:34:12] We can learn not only from David but
[1:34:14] from those who rang themselves against
[1:34:17] him. Awake to help me and behold rise
[1:34:20] toward me and
[1:34:23] see. Thou therefore, oh Lord God, God of
[1:34:27] hosts, the God of Israel. David's
[1:34:31] appealing to God on several levels. As
[1:34:33] as Yahweh, the self-existent one, the
[1:34:36] true God. As Elohim Savote, the the Lord
[1:34:39] of heaven's armies, the Lord of hosts.
[1:34:42] As Eloh is, the God of the covenant
[1:34:46] people, God of Israel, three names, one
[1:34:51] God. Awake to visit all the heathen. Be
[1:34:54] not merciful to any wicked
[1:34:56] transgressors. Saha.
[1:34:59] say law is literally to lift up, to
[1:35:01] exalt. It means stop. Consider what's
[1:35:04] just been
[1:35:06] said. They return at evening. They make
[1:35:09] a noise, muttering and
[1:35:11] growling like a dog, and go round about
[1:35:14] the city. Dog is a derisive porative
[1:35:17] term. Behold, they belch out with their
[1:35:20] mouth. See how they slather at the
[1:35:22] mouth. These two verses express their
[1:35:24] relentless determination to find David
[1:35:27] and kill him. Swords are in their
[1:35:31] lips. Note to self, watch your words.
[1:35:36] They can be very harmful, even deadly.
[1:35:39] For who say they do hear? But thou, oh
[1:35:42] Lord, shall laugh at
[1:35:45] them? Thou shalt have all the heathen in
[1:35:48] derision. Because of the Lord's strength
[1:35:50] will I wait upon thee. For God is my
[1:35:52] defense. The complete Jewish Bible says,
[1:35:55] "My strength I will watch for you. For
[1:35:57] God is my
[1:35:59] fortress. The God of my mercy,
[1:36:02] steadfastness, loving kindness shall
[1:36:04] prevent, that's another King James word,
[1:36:06] shall meet me. God shall let me see my
[1:36:09] desire upon mine enemies. Gaze and
[1:36:12] triumph at my
[1:36:13] foes. Slay them not, lest my people
[1:36:16] forget. Instead, scatter them by power
[1:36:18] and bring them down, oh Lord, our
[1:36:21] shield. Again, appealing to the Lord is
[1:36:24] his defense. For the sin of their mouth
[1:36:27] and the words of their lips, let them
[1:36:29] even be taken in
[1:36:30] their what's that word? Pride, and for
[1:36:34] cursing and lying, which they speak. We
[1:36:38] continue to see David's natural human
[1:36:40] desire to see his enemies vanquished and
[1:36:42] destroyed. He builds his case to the
[1:36:44] Lord for his divine intervention and
[1:36:48] judgment. Consume them in wrath. Consume
[1:36:51] them that they may not be and let them
[1:36:53] know that God rules in Jacob unto the
[1:36:55] ends of the earth.
[1:37:00] Say,
[1:37:05] sorry I got behind.
[1:37:08] Oops, wrong button. There we
[1:37:12] go. At evening, let them return. Let
[1:37:15] them make a noise like a dog and go
[1:37:18] round about the city. Let them wander up
[1:37:20] and down for meat and growl if they be
[1:37:22] not
[1:37:23] satisfied. He's not thinking kind
[1:37:25] thoughts towards the people that are
[1:37:26] trying to kill him. I think it's pretty
[1:37:29] understandable. But in many ways, this
[1:37:32] desire for vengeance and retribution is
[1:37:35] disturbing. Aren't we supposed to love
[1:37:37] our enemies, do good to them? Yet the
[1:37:40] Lord has reserved for himself vengeance
[1:37:43] on his enemies. David is exposing his
[1:37:46] very human nature. He's being we might
[1:37:48] refer to as authentic and
[1:37:51] transparent. And keep in mind, it is
[1:37:54] Torah law often harsh. That's the
[1:37:58] standard, the religious and legal
[1:38:01] context in which David lives and
[1:38:03] functions.
[1:38:05] And now let's see David's heart toward
[1:38:07] the Lord in and in spite of his
[1:38:12] difficulties. But I will remember,
[1:38:16] ponder, meditate. No, I will sing of thy
[1:38:20] power, thy might, thy strength. Yay, I
[1:38:25] will
[1:38:26] murmur, hum quietly. No, I will sing
[1:38:30] aloud.
[1:38:32] The word there is literally, I will
[1:38:35] shout with
[1:38:37] joy of
[1:38:39] thy
[1:38:40] mercy. In the morning I'll survive this
[1:38:44] night, for thou hast been my defense and
[1:38:46] refuge in the day of my
[1:38:48] trouble. Unto thee, oh my
[1:38:51] strength. God is David's strength. Not
[1:38:54] his arm, his sword, his shield, his
[1:38:57] physical prowess, his warrior skills,
[1:39:00] not his courage, not his
[1:39:02] ability, but to God will I sing. And
[1:39:06] again, the word translated sing is yet a
[1:39:08] different word. It means literally make
[1:39:12] music. To God will I make music. For God
[1:39:16] is my defense, my stronghold, and the
[1:39:18] God of my mercy, goodness, kindness, my
[1:39:22] steadfast God.
[1:39:24] In this event of Saul sending a hit
[1:39:26] squad to trap and kill David, we see
[1:39:28] several things. His wife, Michael,
[1:39:31] demonstrates her love for her husband by
[1:39:33] warning him of her father's plans to
[1:39:35] have David
[1:39:36] killed. At great risk to herself, she
[1:39:39] helps David escape and then stalls the
[1:39:41] assassination team, giving David time to
[1:39:44] flee. David, depending on the Lord,
[1:39:47] rushes to Samuel the prophet. He doesn't
[1:39:49] try to round up a counter-strike force.
[1:39:51] He's depending on the Lord.
[1:39:53] In the psalm, we see his frustration.
[1:39:56] I've done nothing to deserve this. Saul
[1:39:59] swore he wouldn't make further attempts
[1:40:01] on my life. And while I'm trying to
[1:40:03] soothe him with the best music I can
[1:40:04] create, he throws a spear at me, then
[1:40:07] sends a hit team to surround my house
[1:40:09] and kill me. I'm not sinfree, but I'm
[1:40:12] not guilty of anything to deserve this
[1:40:14] kind of
[1:40:15] treatment. He desires the Lord to take
[1:40:18] vengeance and destroy those that are
[1:40:20] trying to destroy him.
[1:40:23] We'll see throughout this period of
[1:40:25] David's life till the death of Saul that
[1:40:27] David will never lift his hand against
[1:40:29] Saul. He will never do it. He's God's
[1:40:33] anointed. God chose him. God made him
[1:40:35] king. He's misbehaving. He's doing
[1:40:38] badly. He's not treating me right. This
[1:40:40] is a really bad guy. Wasn't my candidate
[1:40:43] that won the election. Whatever.
[1:40:46] Nonetheless, he is not going to raise
[1:40:48] his hand against the one that God put
[1:40:51] in. He
[1:40:54] recognizes he is powerless in this
[1:40:58] situation. And regardless of the
[1:41:00] outcome, whichever way it goes, he will
[1:41:04] sing praises to God. He will make music.
[1:41:07] He will shout for joy in the morning.
[1:41:10] The musicians could please return.
[1:41:14] Regardless of the outcome of his
[1:41:16] petition to the Lord, persecution, lies,
[1:41:20] and slander directed at him, David will
[1:41:23] sing praises to
[1:41:26] God. Perhaps Paul thought of this psalm
[1:41:28] or one like it as he wrote to the church
[1:41:31] at Ephesus from his prison in Rome.
[1:41:35] Ephesians 5 verse 18. Be not drunk with
[1:41:39] wine, wherein is excess, but
[1:41:42] instead be filled with the
[1:41:45] spirit, speaking to yourselves in what?
[1:41:50] Psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing
[1:41:54] and making melody in your heart to the
[1:41:59] Lord. Giving thanks when things go your
[1:42:01] way. Uh, no, Justin doesn't say. Giving
[1:42:03] thanks always for what? for all things
[1:42:09] unto God and the Father and the name of
[1:42:12] our Lord Jesus Christ. Just like David
[1:42:15] appealed to Yahweh and Elohim Savote and
[1:42:18] Eloh Israel in the psalm we just read.
[1:42:22] One
[1:42:22] God, submitting yourselves one to
[1:42:26] another. That's hard on the
[1:42:30] pride. Submitting yourselves one to
[1:42:33] another in the fear of God. giving
[1:42:37] thanks always be filled with the spirit
[1:42:40] singing and making melody to the Lord
[1:42:43] like David a man after God's own
[1:42:47] heart as we close this portion of
[1:42:49] tonight's service let's stand
[1:42:52] together and let's sing give
[1:42:55] thanks with a grateful
[1:42:59] heart certainly a take-home from this
[1:43:04] song give
[1:43:07] I'm going to need some
[1:43:09] help. The grateful heart give
[1:43:15] thanks to the holy one. Give
[1:43:21] thanks because he's
[1:43:23] given Jesus
[1:43:27] Christ his son.
[1:43:31] Give
[1:43:33] thanks with a grateful heart. Give
[1:43:38] thanks to the holy one. Give
[1:43:44] thanks because he's given Jesus
[1:43:50] Christ his son.
[1:43:54] And
[1:43:56] now let the weak say I am
[1:44:01] strong. Let the poor say I am
[1:44:07] rich because of what the Lord has
[1:44:13] done for us.
[1:44:17] And
[1:44:18] now let the weak say I am
[1:44:24] strong. Let the poor say I am
[1:44:29] rich because of what the Lord has
[1:44:35] done for
[1:44:38] us. Give
[1:44:40] thanks with a grateful heart. Give
[1:44:46] thanks to the holy one. Give

[1:45:30] strong. Let the poor say I am rich.
[1:45:36] because of what the Lord has
[1:45:41] done for

[1:45:46] now let the weak say I am
[1:45:51] strong. Let the poor say I am
[1:45:57] great because of what the Lord has
[1:46:02] done for us.
[1:46:06] give thanks.
[1:46:11] I
[1:46:12] wonder as brother Ly was up there and he
[1:46:16] was tying the
[1:46:18] psalm into what had taken place
[1:46:25] when David said, "Deliver me from mine
[1:46:28] enemies, oh God. Oh my God, defend me
[1:46:31] from them that rise up against me.
[1:46:33] Deliver me from the workers of iniquity
[1:46:35] and save me from bloody men. For lo,
[1:46:38] they lie and wait for my soul. The
[1:46:41] mighty are gathered against me. Not for
[1:46:44] my transgression, nor for my sin, oh
[1:46:47] Lord, they run and prepare themselves
[1:46:50] without my fault. Awake to help me. And
[1:46:56] behold, I
[1:47:00] wonder this psalm. We know what it was
[1:47:04] written
[1:47:05] about. I wonder if David was
[1:47:10] there. And as Saul's armies, Saul's men
[1:47:14] began to surround
[1:47:16] him. I wonder if that's the moment that
[1:47:19] he
[1:47:19] pinned this psalm. I wonder if that's
[1:47:23] the moment that he he took a an animal
[1:47:26] skin maybe and and wrote it down or I
[1:47:29] wonder if he was recalling this later
[1:47:32] on. We'll never know here on earth, but
[1:47:36] one day maybe we can ask him in heaven.
[1:47:39] I'm looking forward to that story.
[1:47:40] Brother Aaron and brother Ly and I were
[1:47:44] rejoicing before
[1:47:46] um we came out here thinking about maybe
[1:47:49] talking to some of these
[1:47:51] these prophets and these these great
[1:47:53] people in the Bible and and hearing the
[1:47:56] stories firsthand. But I wonder I wonder
[1:47:59] if that psalm was
[1:48:02] written in the moment that David was in
[1:48:06] fear and he just jotted down this
[1:48:10] prayer or if it was written after the
[1:48:13] fact. I don't know. But it's beautiful.
[1:48:15] It's David is a he was a great man.
[1:48:18] things that David
[1:48:19] [Music]
[1:48:20] did were
[1:48:22] great man after God's own heart. And as
[1:48:25] brother Ly digs deeper
[1:48:27] in, and we say it all the time, a very,
[1:48:30] very flawed man. But wow,
[1:48:35] really, who's greater than David? Who is
[1:48:39] greater than that man? Brother
[1:48:43] David
[1:48:44] Manasi Kenya. Brother David, can you
[1:48:48] come up and close? My brother,
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:01] amazing
[1:49:02] [Music]
[1:49:04] grace
[1:49:06] shall be my song of praise.
[1:49:13] For it was
[1:49:16] great that was my
[1:49:24] liberty. I do not
[1:49:28] know just why he came to love me.
[1:49:35] So he loved
[1:49:40] beyond my fault.
[1:49:43] and saw my name.
[1:49:48] I shall
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:53] forever lift my eyes to
[1:49:59] hell to view the
[1:50:03] cross where Jesus died for me.
[1:50:12] How marvelous
[1:50:15] has the grace that caught my falling
[1:50:23] soul. He looked
[1:50:27] beyond my fall and all I
[1:50:33] [Music]
[1:50:37] need. Let's go before the Lord in
[1:50:39] prayer.
[1:50:42] Our dear gracious heavenly
[1:50:44] father, we are very thankful dear Lord
[1:50:48] God to come before you this particular
[1:50:50] evening dear Lord
[1:50:52] God just to worship
[1:50:54] you in truth and in spirit of thy word
[1:50:58] dear Lord God.
[1:51:01] Father
[1:51:02] God, we are still looking upon you, dear
[1:51:05] Lord
[1:51:06] God, that you continue revealing
[1:51:08] yourself to us throughout the eternity.
[1:51:11] Dear Lord
[1:51:13] God, we humb ourselves into thy
[1:51:15] presence. Dear Lord
[1:51:17] God, expecting dear Lord
[1:51:20] God that thy Holy
[1:51:23] Ghost, your spirit of love, dear Lord
[1:51:26] God, may come in us dear Lord God and
[1:51:30] quicken our mortal bodies into the
[1:51:33] subjection of thy word, dear Lord God.
[1:51:36] Father
[1:51:37] God, I commit your children now into
[1:51:41] your hands. Dear Lord
[1:51:42] God, we've heard from thy servant, dear
[1:51:46] Lord God, whom you anointed to serve thy
[1:51:50] people. Dear Lord
[1:51:51] God, may you
[1:51:54] continue to model his life into our
[1:51:57] lives. Dear Lord God,
[1:52:00] dear Lord
[1:52:01] God, we may do only which is according
[1:52:05] to thy will, dear Lord God, but not
[1:52:08] according to our will, dear Lord God.
[1:52:11] Father
[1:52:12] God, we also need a people, we have
[1:52:16] various needs, the flesh, dear Lord God,
[1:52:20] spiritual needs and physical needs, dear
[1:52:22] Lord God. We ask you kindly the Lord who
[1:52:26] knoweth all these needs, dear Lord God,
[1:52:29] that you may come and grant to each one
[1:52:32] of those needs, dear Lord God, according
[1:52:34] to thy holy will, dear Lord
[1:52:36] God. Father God, we're just coming to
[1:52:40] the end of this
[1:52:42] fellowship and we ask you
[1:52:45] kindly that as we leave this place, dear
[1:52:48] Lord
[1:52:48] God, let your holy presence be in us. Go
[1:52:53] with us, dear Lord God, and guide us
[1:52:56] along the way, dear Lord God. If it's
[1:52:58] your will, dear Lord God, that there
[1:53:01] will be another time of coming together
[1:53:04] again for the worship of thy word, we
[1:53:08] shall praise you, Father God, and our
[1:53:11] spirits shall lift you up in
[1:53:15] satisfaction and in praise to thy holy
[1:53:19] name, dear Lord God. For unto this
[1:53:22] purpose you brought us into this world
[1:53:24] to praise you and to worship you, dear
[1:53:26] Lord God. We remember you, Father God in
[1:53:30] everything that we do. And we ask you
[1:53:33] kindly that let your holy blessings be
[1:53:36] upon us, be upon our loved ones, dear
[1:53:39] Lord God, that we may watch over them in
[1:53:42] whichever situation they may be in. Dear
[1:53:44] Lord God, we thank you so much dear Lord
[1:53:46] God for this evening and we ask this
[1:53:51] prayer humbly and trusting in the holy
[1:53:55] and mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:57] Christ. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:05] Amazing
[1:54:07] grace shall always be my song of
[1:54:15] praise. For it was
[1:54:20] great that bought my liberty.
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:28] I do not
[1:54:32] know just why he came to love me.
[1:54:39] So he looked
[1:54:43] beyond my faults and saw my need.
[1:54:52] I shall
[1:54:56] forever lift my eyes to
[1:55:03] Calary to view the
[1:55:07] cross where Jesus died for me.
[1:55:15] How
[1:55:19] marvelous the grace that go my falling
[1:55:26] soul. He looked
[1:55:30] beyond my fall and saw my need.
[1:55:36] Amen. Amen. Praise God. I looked back
[1:55:40] there and I said, "Brother David," and
[1:55:42] there's two Davids standing in line.
[1:55:46] Both of them looked at me like, "You're
[1:55:48] going to have to go a little
[1:55:50] further on your explanation there,
[1:55:52] Brother Daniel." God bless you, brothers
[1:55:54] and sisters. Looking forward to
[1:55:56] continuing on with this great
[1:55:59] warrior, David. And uh come prepared
[1:56:03] this Sunday if if the Lord's willing
[1:56:04] this Sunday evening. I I would like to
[1:56:07] have a testimony service. Brother Paul
[1:56:09] Murray shared a testimony with me
[1:56:10] earlier today. I thought, you know, the
[1:56:12] congregation really needs to hear that.
[1:56:15] And I know that all of us, the Lord's
[1:56:16] always doing something special in all of
[1:56:18] our lives. So, come
