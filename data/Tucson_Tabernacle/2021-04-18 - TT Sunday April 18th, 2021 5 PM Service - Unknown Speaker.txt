heart of worship when the music fades it all is stripped away and i simply come longing just to bring something that's a worth that will bless your heart i bring you more than a song for a song in

standing on holy ground [Music] and i know that there are angels all around so let us pray [Music] jesus now we are standing in his presence on holy ground we are standing on holy grounds and i know that there are angels all around us praise jesus now we are standing [Music] do you believe that do you believe there's angels the bible says they're ministering spirits for those of us that are coming into this inheritance they're ministering to us along the way thank the lord for that as brother aaron prepares to come let's just sing there's a sweet sweet spirit in this place sweet spirit in this place and i know that it's [Music] on each face and i know that it's the presence oh sweet holy spirit sweet heaven [Music] and for these blessings we lift our hearts away without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived when we shall let's sing that first [Music] there's verse [Music] and i know that it's the blessings of the lord [Music] and i know that is [Music] stay right here us with your love and for these blessings [Music] let's just bow our heads and lord we thank you because you said where two or three are gathered in your name and that's how we've come lord under the precious shed blood of the lamb in the name of the lord jesus christ so you promised you would be here lord and even the atmosphere and the attitude in the hearts are changed saying lord we love you we appreciate you and we thank you lord now lord as we speak some more of your word today lord that life-giving word lord may the presence of the holy spirit just magnify it to us just open it to us and feed us lord for we ask you in jesus christ's name amen so while you're standing thank you musicians appreciate that we there's a couple of scriptures we didn't read in in the order i kept looking at the time and kind of saying i want to be done by this time so and then this afternoon i just came to the back here and i was just talking to the lord and and he brought something to my remembrance to add to to today so let's just read it's uh isaiah 65 17 and then you may be seated after this isaiah 65 17. he says for behold i create a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind amen you may be seated god bless you brother gnats good to see you you kept your word yesterday in the uh minister's meeting he said i'll come by and see you tomorrow evening so amen thank thank you brother in it i was talking to brother peter and something else from yesterday's ministers meeting i asked him brother peter have you ever heard of stone soup and he kind of said hmm not too sure so i said well let me tell you about stone soup how many know about stone soup all right a couple of people don't so the brother just used it in an illustration it was a man he was coming through town old town just walking down the dirt road and all he had was a stone and a pot and he was hungry so he got to the edge of the the town and he made a little fire set the stone on it the pot in there filled it up with water and put a stone in it and began to stir it and and here here's the key he looked like he was enjoying it okay he was getting there stirring it okay first person comes by and just oh what are you doing he said i've got stone soup in there have you ever had any you ought to try it but you know what would really make it good is if you by chance had a carrot and you tossed it in there that'd really help it taste better so he had more folks that would come and buy it and each person that came by he asked them they'd ask what it is he goes well it's stone and carrot soup now but if you had some cabbage that would make it even better by the time it was all said and done it was a good vegetable soup and the brother used that he said come and bring your part and add your part today and we can enjoy this together so it reminded me of that today each one bringing their lick of fire each bringing their portion each bringing their amen and hallelujah it makes a good time together here so the other scripture was um brother jeremy the other one you told me i missed the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament show his work handiwork you know the scripture before that we had just read was for behold i create a new heaven and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but you know we look at that heaven that earth but what about this and having them create you allowing him to create a good atmosphere about you you inviting him you making yourself making him welcome you're saying here i am lord and he says the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament show and i just want to say let this part of that also show the same of his handiwork so we were we had just finished there with um psalms 23 talking about the atmosphere that david created the lord is my shepherd i shall not want there goes that feeling of not having he maketh me to lie down there's that atmosphere of rest and he begins to create an atmosphere about him surely goodness though i walk through the valley i will fear no evil thy rod thy staff they comfort me he's creating a wonderful atmosphere about him so i was thinking about that and in prayer and i said lord you know just talking to him a little while this this afternoon and i appreciate that he's never busy i appreciate that he has everybody on the main line but he can talk to each individual he knows you by name he knows your situation he doesn't say who are you again that happened a few times yesterday god bless you brother aaron good to see how you doing i'm like god bless you brother but who are you again you know we have a tendency to forget and you know they were wearing the name tags and that helped a lot you know but he just reminded me something let's go to um luke chapter one we'll go from 26 to 41. and i felt the lord impressed on this on me strongly about watch this atmosphere that was created so luke chapter 1 we'll start with verse 26. well known scripture luke started starts it and the birth of jesus christ was on this wise but let's go is here and on the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail mary thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women what a greeting what a greeting that he would speak to you that same way you are blessed among all that are on this earth i've been going through the the fifth seal now and there are paragraphs starting about 225 to about uh 280 or so brother branham is is really getting into israel those souls crying out from under the altar but there's a portion of grace that is so manifested there and he types it of course we know they see times it with joseph and his brethren and the blinding of their eyes so that you and i would have a chance brother branham says o see the grace of god undeserving nothing good should not even have been included that's right but he chose you and me and that so here he is he is working on that here he said thou art blessed earth among women and when she saw him she was troubled at this saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation should this be maybe some scriptures maybe something maybe isaiah behold a virgin shall conceive clicked in the back of her head and something's going on could this be that but she's married she's human no it couldn't be me no who am i to deserve such a thing but watch and the angel said unto her fear not mary don't let that become the atmosphere you create fear she says he tells her fear not for thou has found favor with god why mary because god she found favor with god put your name in there because i have found favor with god he knows me by name he calls me and i answer because he loves me because of his grace let's go on here and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus again maybe mary's mind goes back to emmanuel god with us i don't think he chose mary because she had no idea what was going on mary because she there was something in her that would respond okay he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord shall give him give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end it's an eternal kingdom mary lord i want to get into that kingdom i want to be part of that eternal kingdom just uh the last couple of days in in in england was it prince philip that passed away almost 100 years old you saw you see the change in the natural kingdom but in this one it's a eternal kingdom with no end you know everybody's wondering well who's going to take his place who's going to become this who's going to have this but god's word tells us we will abide with him forever and ever we will be part of him we there's no end to that kingdom but here it is he says let's go on to the next verse then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seen i know not a man angel mary is still looking at it and she's saying wait a minute you're giving out a promise but everything i know it has to be done this way this is all we've ever known and the angel answered her and said oh mary you disbelieving unbeliever no he didn't he said the holy ghost shall come come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore all also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god tell me what did the work the holy ghost it takes the holy spirit to get into the right atmosphere but there was a still a part mary had to play and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren and then he explains to mary for with god nothing shall be impossible so he's now telling mary i'm going to show you something mary i'm going to prove to you everything that i'm i'm not going to leave you hanging there mary you're going to know this is true so mary when she hears it she says behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word there's the key to creating to allowing that behold thy servant behold thy handmaid be it unto me according to your word lord i just don't know i'm not worthy i'm not good enough how could it be i've done this mary didn't stop there she said be it unto me according to thy word and then the angel departed from her and mary arose in those days she remembered what the angel said behold thy cousin elizabeth and went into the hill country with haste into the city of judah well i'm going to go see my cousin elizabeth but i've got a couple other things to do we'll get there eventually no it says she made a beeline she went straight and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and watch the atmosphere it had created and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost what did peter and john do when they came down after the day of pentecost and they were on their way to the temple and they met the need they were first responders like we we said alms can you help me and immediately they turned and said we're going to the temple we're going to pray we'll come back later and we'll see what we can do with you no that kingdom was living in them already that atmosphere was bound they said hey look upon us such as i have i give unto you i don't have silver i don't have gold i don't have a medical degree i don't have this but such as i have in the name of the lord jesus christ rise up and walk that's what it creates that's but mary had to say be it unto me according to thy word if you haven't said that today's a good day to start so so we know that creating an atmosphere living in a good atmosphere um taking control of the atmosphere around you not letting another atmosphere control you sometimes you walk in out on the job site um you have two or three crews working a house and each one has their radio and it's blasting this one is playing mexican music this one's playing something else every once while i walk in and somebody's got a good christian radio going on sometimes there's even some preaching going on and man it's just just a whole lot easier to go work in there but most of the time it's just blasting music and it creates a hard atmosphere to work and me being spiritual and all and loving the the folks i say lord can you cause the rating to break right about now can we unplug the radio but you know i found that he's greater than that i began to think about him began to and pretty soon it you don't even notice it anymore or you can let it control you amen that's your choice there so so we're looking at that and he's in and and seeing an atmosphere created so so now the disciples the disciples have been with jesus for three and a half years and and i know there were some rough times there were some hard times jesus operated them jesus had to tell them jesus had do some things they didn't understand everything but they knew there was something different about this man when he come by and he called them by name knew who they were when he told peter castanet on the other side when he said to nathanael behold an israelite whom there is no guile what a difference in this man could this be the very messiah when he stands in front of the tomb and says lazarus come forth roll the stone away let him come out i am the resurrection and they're watching this happen but when he's coming to his death when he's coming to giving his life peter and all the other disciples said it said peter and the others said will go with you will not deny you if you read the scripture says all of them said the same but when it came down to that where were they jesus looks at peter and he says peter you're going to deny me three times he did and to take to stop for a minute what was the atmosphere like brother lyle covered that pretty good the other night the atmosphere of fear of wondering of questioning peter said let's go back to fishing like we used to be let's just go back what we used to know we know that pretty good but on the day of pentecost here's the key acts two one through four a change of an atmosphere not only the atmosphere around them but the atmosphere in them and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place okay it took some time approximately 10 days to get in one accord in one place and it can take it's some work it's some humbling of self it's some saying not my will but thy will be done i'm willing to let this go i'm willing to sacrifice myself for the blessing on others coming down to that place the very master who knelt down at their feet and washed their feet coming down to that place coming over to one another in there and say you know philip or you know whoever the different disciples you remember when this happened and that happened and i i i kind of got upset with you i'm sorry would you forgive me creating an atmosphere and coming into one accord yes well the holy spirit would be able to come in and pour itself in one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as a spirit gave them utterance to each individual peter didn't stand up and say when he began to speak and said now the holy ghost came upon me therefore i'm the leader of this group and you have to do what i say it was to each individual brother branham tells us the coals of fire each one being a coal of fire and and and getting together and creating a great warmth a great fire where when they get out as individuals you begin to get cold you begin to lose that heat around you but when you draw an eye to one another and you create a good atmosphere the holy spirit can move the holy spirit can begin to deal the holy spirit can talk to you as individuals because he does he does you know it's somebody says well i really enjoyed when the brother ministered this it spoke to my heart and somebody else has and when he said this part over here it spoke to my heart and somebody else said i i just didn't seem to catch it until the very end he said this and oh my that did bless me everybody got that portion they needed and some of you are fortunate because you got the whole thing for you but that which you need god provides amen they were filled with the holy ghost and boy did the atmosphere change after that those disciples who were who were afraid who were hiding who who said i don't know him even cursed who ran away who didn't believe the sisters when they told him he has risen we have seen him now they're out there and they're saying let us get out and get this gospel this living god to everybody let us when when the when the the saddest pharisees the them took them and beat them and striped them and said do not preach in his name and they turn around said who should we listen to to man or to god when these disciples are are being crucified when they're being they're ending their life they're saying crucify me upside down i don't even deserve to be crucified like my lord look at the change that came in upon him filled with the holy ghost but still men and women it did not make them angels it gave them overcoming power in this life and this and that's what we need because this is a life we have to bear you know peter and paul has to come in and correct peter when paul comes in and he says peter why are you acting like that over here you were with the gentiles on this but now they come you run over here with the jews and he and he calls him out on that paul and silas went together and mark and barnabas went together why because there was contention among them who's the greater lord hey we're human we are but the holy ghost in you that individual experience that infilling in your life is the overcoming power it's the one if you'll surrender quickly and let that atmosphere change talking with sister nadine words and i've shared this i did some work in her house one time and and i was there for two days and she just began to share her experiences with brother brown and you know that one of the the most common things you heard about brother branham was when he would walk in the humility and the sweetness of it just changed the whole atmosphere not walking in like i'm in charge of this you got no just a sweetness good evening friends called them all friends he didn't say for those of you who agree my message are my brothers the rest of you you're out he called them friends well she talked about him coming over because he would brother branham would drop brother joseph off there at the house sam him and brother bobby were good friends and she would care for and he said brother branham always had a kind word something nice to say something encouraging and when he left you felt like he made you important and he was not important he didn't come in and say well i'm the prophet of the god you owe me this honor me respect me this but sister nadine knew who he was so she did it anyways there's the key each one doing their part say not my will but thy will be done saying you first honor my brother honor my sister well while you're honoring your brother sister somebody's honoring you it's the body feeding itself you know sometimes and it's easy and i understand we have people we love people that mean a lot to us then and we honor them and there's nothing wrong with that but in god's side you're worth just as much as the next one next to you he gave his life fully and freely for you you say oh brother aaron i'm i'm no good look what i've done all have sinned and come short of the glory god that's right a little sin caused his death as much as a big sin caused his death the shedding of his blood the stripes on his back a cold and cancer both of them caused stripes on his back for everything sometimes you say well i'm not worthy that brother that sister she deserves better than me and that brother and that such are saying i'm not worthy i'm not worthy that one deserves more and better than me brother branham brother brother branham the lord jesus humbles himself and he kneels down before his disciples and washes their feet and says you call me master and lord and he goes i am but i've humbled myself willingly and washed your feet the work of the holy spirit in our lives because we can't do this without him as hard as we try we will fail somebody will get you just about that time when you think you got it made and they'll remind you you're human real quick and you come back and say lord have mercy on me i've done something wrong there was a brother who who used to attend to church in hell brother he's passed away brother paul noriega he felt that in the calling of his life was to pull on my ear i'd be sitting down like there where brother enoch is or something that brother paul would walk by and just reach over and do this to me all the time you ever heard of terms of endearment that was brother paul's to me first couple of times i got a little upset with him but i realized he was just saying hey brother good to see you a little different than some other people see how do you receive it how do you take you could be offended you could be heard you could say hey brother paul noticed me thank the lord for that we did that i change the atmosphere real quick for myself sometimes simple things really help us you know but to see it's god's great mercy so let's look at a couple of quotes here that we didn't get to let's the first quote there from divine love we've heard brother branham preach us quite a bit quite a few messages about that love yeah and the bull we know that he was crossing that that field and and he goes the bull came to me just just as hard as he could no fear i wasn't a bit more afraid than i would be a brother neville sitting right here just a pure holy love in my heart what did it do it created an atmosphere and that bull run right into that atmosphere it wasn't a barbed wire fence it wasn't a chain-link fence it was an atmosphere that had more power to stop a charging bull than a fence did it could take not only stop the bull but change it they could take somebody with a hard heart with a mean intention and they run into the atmosphere and they fall on their knees and say god forgive me save me help me that's that atmosphere it says not 10 from me before he stopped and throwed his feet out he looked right here so defeated with the most mech look on his face and turned around and walked over there and laid down and i passed within five feet what is it when divine love is projected sovereign grace takes over at that time you know to imagine that happen it takes god in a man as hard as you want to do it on your own i'm waiting for brother dan roberts to come after me and i'm going to love him so hard he's going to stop it doesn't work that way unless me and brother dan plan it brother dan come at me and then fall at my feet please so the people will be impressed well you'll see through that fallacy right away but when there's a true love of god presence of god about brother brandon would say don't fear it don't fear it don't be afraid of it it's him he's right here and people would enter into that presence and boy did it change things he says hebrews chapter 2 blessed be that tie that binds our hearts with christian fellowship the love of god when he rose he wasn't finished yet he had some more work to do the bible said he ascended on high and gave give gifts unto men there was an atmosphere hung over the earth of darkness of gloom of death and weary the prayers couldn't come up be because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through that veil he opened up the way he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of weary he broke the veil of depressed and broke every veil and made a highway for the wayfary men walking up the king's highway every one of those he broke that atmosphere so we could enter into his atmosphere and watch you can see yourself at times right there and said it's been it's been broken i can enter into the presence of god i can walk into the holy of holies and commune with him and hear back from him i can leave my rod there and come back in and it is bearing fruit because he's alive he's the same yesterday today and forever from souls that are in prison now oh our hearts beat high and of great anticipation waiting for that hour to arrive with that all fears vanish from us we have nothing to fear nothing to dread we look forward to the promise that the eternal god has made us and we know that it's truth that's why we live we live for that that hour that time when this mortal shall be changed and we shall be made like him and there will be no more sickness no more sorrow no more heartache oh it'll be all over then and with joy of heart we in faith and courage we look forward for that day the veil was rent in two therefore we had access back to him hebrews 11 6 tells us without faith it is impossible to please god so is his word true can you take a hold of him and say i'll lay my life on his word on his promise and i'll not back off of it though god slay me yet i'll trust him these skin worms though they enter my body yet these eyes shall behold and behold my redeemer liveth job crying out calling out before the holy ghost even come but seeing a living god working the testimony of a true witness let's go ahead and just this but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him lord i need you right now but i've got a lot of things to take care of so can you just wait there for a bit lord it's sunday so i'm going to go seek you in church today but the rest of the week is my time oh brother and i never say that but what about what our actions say at times those that diligent seek them those that put the effort those that spend the time those that seek his face continually but not without believing that he is that he exists that he's everything he said he is that he keeps his word because if you can't believe that you can't draw night to you but if you can take him by faith and you seek him he is a rewarder he will give you the blessing he will give you the infilling he will fill your cup till it runeth over and the joy of the lord is your strength the testimony of a true witness for as i said at the beginning of the message father as the least lights go back to the root where it come from and wait for another season we know that we're nearing another season he says we feel the changing of the atmosphere the spiritual atmosphere the day is about to break and we'll wake in a great a great millennium for we we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which are asleep for we say this by the commandment of the lord that the trumpet shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise and we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye brother branham was speaking of that atmosphere back then how many times if you're reading through the message in 61 62 all the way up to 65 especially where he says i just don't see anything else there is but the coming of the lord everything seems to be half fulfilled and that desire that draw that that pull even so come lord jesus the mighty conqueror there is so little spoke of this ascension it's one of the greatest days when he ascended up because all over the earth since the day in the garden of eden that sin was committed all heaven was shut off from mankind satan is the prince of the power there that's right why art thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer no man could see unto glory no man could understand because the power is just above it heaven means atmosphere and then all those powers were shut off from mankind because of sin but when he died and rose again and come up what happened then all of it was broke all of it was open when he rent the veil in twing it says we had access back to what adam and eve had you know i was listening to to this man and this kind of brought this thought i think it was brother robert figured oh that forwarded he's a kind of a scientist and a christian and he was taking time to disprove scripturally disprove um not i was going to say the creation evolution and showing in scripture and what they have shown how wrong it is when they built this and said look at what this was look what this was and they discovered that some of the bones don't even belong to human they belong to animals and but they won't back off from it he's selling and he's using scriptures he's also making you laugh he's a little bit a little funny but he's saying watch what god said here watch what the word of god says here watch what this says he says they have found these evidences in the earth they've discovered it they just can't say we're wrong there is a god up there so it kind of started this god creating an atmosphere in the garden of eden a place where he set his first creation adam and eve a place that was rest there was light there was peace now it says adam and eve kept the garden the alarm didn't go off at nine o'clock in the morning time to get up i will work till six and that's the end of the day no they went out and they dressed the garden they you know moved this the way brother branham explains it adam i need a little more shade over here well let's just take that tree and set it over here creative power they were sons and daughters of god going back to an atmosphere like that hard to believe sometimes but it's true get into the presence of god one time and you'll see how true it is what a great and mighty god he is how he delivers how he changes a heart how he takes a situation and turns it around completely when there was hatred and meanness and vileness when there was one who had taken the money as a tax collector and when he when god comes into his home and gets into his heart he said i will repay back up to four times that's a change that's not a man saying i'm going to do these deeds to be good that's a change of the heart of a man i think it was elizabeth that talked about that in sunday school class today and and the kids played out the skit and one of the boys got on his knees to play the part and literally repented on his knees in the class elizabeth said boy that just to see that the young man took it and made it real lord i'm sorry forgive me all when god gets into a person's heart and changes it it's not works anymore that's something that god does let's go to the scriptures back finish up with the scriptures now i think we finished off right after psalms 23 and then acts 2. we'll go right after acts 2. he says but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for it is the father's good pleasure to give to give you the kingdom sell what you have give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not whether where no thief approaches neither does moth corrupt he's telling them seek the kingdom of god first look into that atmosphere because in that atmosphere everything is possible in the other atmosphere there's doubt there there's a hesitation there's wondering this day yes i can i can run through a troop and jump over all and tomorrow you're running the other way and hiding but you get into the kingdom of god and then you're like peter and john that says such as i have in the name of jesus christ i give it unto you let's continue on the scriptures there for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven lord and sometimes i find myself saying even so come quickly lord jesus but then i checked my attitude as why i'm saying that uh some bills are due some payments are owed some i got to go ask for forgiveness i've got to go repent i've got to go take care of something so i'm saying lord would you come right about now and then we won't have to deal with it but that's not the right attitude he says live on this earth as christians do that which is right live brother branham said like he's coming today plan like he's not coming for a hundred years but live like he's coming today ready if he should call you today you're ready to go if he should not call you for another 100 years you're still ready to go today but you have the spirit of god man living in you growing through you causing you allowing to you to live each day he says for we grow for this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house that body which is eternal it's our desire and then peter tells us this peter ii peter 3 13-14 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless search me o god know my heart today lord i bow my heart before you i confess anything wrong cleanse it wash it i'm not going to be able to do this in self-righteousness i'm not going to be able to do this in my works but you said you would do it in me if i yield myself to you you know to see the different examples as we were talking about brother branham there and sister sister nadine she said there was just something about him that made you feel special made you feel wanted made you feel like you were important i owed a debt i could not pay and he paid a debt he did not owe i needed someone to wash my sins away i now can sing a brand new song amazing grace christ jesus paid a debt that i could never pay you know him that way today have you experienced that in your life he's forgiven you he's cleansed you he's washed you you stand before him in his righteousness and therefore you can enter into his presence in in a veil of white cleansed and washed brother branham talked about the time that he walked into that restaurant that little place he said and and he saw the sinful actions of those about and his heart just got he got angry got upset and i said god how can you stand this look at that filth and god takes them outside and just says let me show you something real quick here he said and brother bam sees the sin going up and hitting that blood barrier and bouncing off and brother branham said is this my sin and jesus tells him yes and boy did that change his attitude immediately he went back in and he said i need to offer them that same blood that same forgiveness that same opportunity that's a change of nature that's a change of atmosphere in just a few minutes somebody going back and said brother god is merciful god is good god is forgiving god is kind how do i know because he's done it for me can you recommend him to somebody else let me put this way does your life advertise him or is it only when you speak words or does all around you is there an atmosphere that brother braham says a christian carries about them and it affects others and they come up to you and say there's something different about you will you pray for me will you and they begin to ask they begin to draw from you life jesus tells his disciples as he's going they're going through towards samaria he says i must go this way you you boys go over there and get some food i'm gonna go see he didn't tell him this but he knew i'm gonna go see a woman at the well he also knew who she was and and and uh and her her uh what what this the description of her would have been if somebody told you who she was jesus don't you know about this woman she's had five husbands the one she's not with it's not even hers she has to be at the well at this time because she lives such a life and jesus said i know i gotta go talk to her i gotta go deal with her amen and she sits down and he goes now woman let me tell you how sinful you are no he opened the conversation woman draw give me a cup of water that's what she was doing she was drawing water she didn't say a woman start a fire make me make me something to eat he said draw me a cup of water and she looks at him and says you obviously don't know who i am because you wouldn't ask me you you would be seen with me right now and boy you would be labeled as a as you know somebody not to be around and he says no i'm here for a reason because if you knew who i was you would be asking me to draw water and give it to you that's right and if it's jesus in you isn't that water there also shouldn't it be able to be given to others shouldn't it be able to be shared such as i have i give unto you sometimes it's amen and sometimes it's only the musicians would come sometimes we have to sing search me oh god and know my heart today see if there be some wicked way in me sometimes it's praise and worship god accepts it and hears it all so maybe play that song search me oh god this powerhead lord we've ministered your word today as you gave it to us an atmosphere about us a presence about us you said your word is a lamp unto our feet it guides each step that we take lord we have a destination that we're headed for we have in our hearts something we're looking to lord let your word with your presence go for us lord and may we follow that way as our prayer lord see if there be something that we still have to make right see if there be something that we just need to make sure it's okay lord something that maybe it causes that presence to to just move off to one side search our hearts that allow you to lord to walk close to us as you drew up to those walking towards the mass you saw their hearts were heavy you saw their heads were down you overheard their conversation what it must have been like lord and you came to talk with them draw night to each one of us today we pray in jesus christ's name oh sir i know my heart [Music] know my thoughts i [Music] somewhere [Music] oh [Music] revive all comes from [Music] our thou wilt supply our [Music] maybe while you're sitting there just about your hands close your eyes for a moment humble your heart before the lord just say lord is there something in me something that has caused that atmosphere to be a little disturbed brother branham says sometimes we can offend the holy spirit it'll just fly off to the side he won't leave you just waiting for you to say i'm sorry lord maybe something that god brings to your heart to your mind right now and say lord i'm sorry forgive me for that i want to do better than that maybe if we just bow our heads and we'll just talk to the lord about i don't know but you do i would look over my own heart right now and say lord i'm failing here i was wrong at that but you search even deeper then maybe show us something that is that's hindering us to allow you to have that full liberty lord and we would quickly say i'm sorry lord let's make it right let's ask for forgiveness therefore we can have the presence of the lord to be with us and be like david at that point as he said just a joy the joy of the lord is my strength the peace of god that covers us lord a sweetness in our life lord jesus [Music] let it be because it's what you desire as you would come down in the cool of the evening and talk with abraham with adam and eve and say how is it today my children how was it today and just have a wonderful time lord may we come to that same place lord in our lives with nothing henry in jesus christ's name amen there's a sweet sweet spirit in this place [Music] oh there's a sword if you want to stand and just thank him for that and i know that is [Music] and i know that it's the presence of [Music] and for these our blessings without a doubt [Music] thank you lord for making me thank you [Music] me thank you for saving my soul thank you lord for making me thank you [Music] he gave it it's freely yours to receive and to be grateful for it and then the scripture tell us to be ready to give an account for that hope that lies within you to be able to share not only in the atmosphere but then taking and giving it in words you would like to have that atmosphere accept the lord jesus christ as your savior he'll forgive you of your sins he'll cleanse you he'll wash you he'll make you a new person amen that's what he did for me i didn't go to school for this i didn't study for this i just surrendered to him and that's what he did for me how many knows that's true god is so good isn't he not he's so good to us god bless you tonight just just let me say it to moms and then i'll say it to dads because we all need it sometimes the kids get a little like we were when we were kids probably [Music] and sometimes the atmosphere changes quickly brother branham said as quick as you can just settle it down real quick and say okay and he says quick as you can make it right quick as you can say i'm sorry quick as you can say honey i love you i didn't mean that and watch the attitude change i i i think of this often i believe it was brother galdon or my brother evil frank he was had gone to see brother brown and uh i believe sister woods had made a pie or something and she said i'm taking this over to brother bill and and so brother frank i believe that i remember writing frank he's like waiting for the sister to come back because she wanted he wanted to know what was the prophet of god doing was the pillar of fire there was he studying was he preaching what was he doing sister what was brother branham doing oh he was helping sister meaty wash the dishes [Music] brother dan lord help us huh sometimes i love clean dishes to eat out of but can i be willing to go help and wash them could i could i help change the atmosphere sometimes just a simple thing that changes the whole atmosphere something that says i love you i made it with all my heart you love the lord jesus he's so good god bless you as you go we'll meet together again on wednesday night lord willing i haven't heard from brother daniel yet but if if he's here if not then brother lyle has something prepared for wednesday night i do
