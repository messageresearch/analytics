to sing about the lord jesus there's no question who we're singing about there right amen this isn't some modern thing where you don't know if you're singing to your boyfriend or your girlfriend we're singing about the love of jesus christ and the redemption of jesus christ amen appreciate all the specials tonight young people singing all of us together we're just making a joyful noise into the lord amen amen i don't know where all our where's brother arnie is brother arnie out there all right well you know i want to recognize a few brothers and maybe just maybe we'll give them a round of applause here in just a minute i want to recognize brother aaron as a deacon if we just hold it we're going to clap all together for these brothers i appreciate brother aaron brother ed brother arnie brother jordan amen god bless my friend brother lyle there's we can mention a lot more but these brothers asked we could do communion they're in here filling the pans and going the extra mile doing the bread and the wine and making sure it all works and brother lyle helping me behind the scenes and hey man i wonder if we could just recognize them just give a little amen a little uh rose man god bless you aaron each one of the brothers amen i'd rather give them a rose now and wait till they're in a box and then give them a whole bouquet we just give them a little rose in fact we just keep giving roses how's that sound amen happy mother's day to all the mothers amen i want to thank you all for listening this morning my goodness i don't know if i've ever seen you all listen everybody's eyes are just so intense and listening and i probably could have preached another hour but i'm trying to be better right trying to be good and not preach as long amen we want brother robert figueroa to come i remember when he was here and we'd been down to his church when brother zach wallace had preached here a few years ago but when he came to the easter meetings we had him pray i just felt the kindred spirit the lord kind of welded our spirits together and we had lunch together the other day and i just appreciate our brother robert i appreciate his spirit amen so many ministers as they get older they've been through so many battles sometimes their spirit gets a little bitter he was telling us the other day how you gotta sweeten your spirit with prayer and drain all of that stuff out put the drain plug back in and say lord fill me up with the holy spirit yes amen amen i was thinking about that i think he's actually helped here at the church about 28 years i think he mentioned something like that and he's been helping the sister church down in sarah vista and i just asked him if you wouldn't mind coming and just preaching the gospel and amen i told him to just take his liberty and preach whatever is on his heart and this is a spirit-filled church right that means you let the holy spirit say whatever he wants to say because if it's the holy spirit saying it'll be right and we as ministers we have to go back and study and get in the word and the message and be sure that it's what the bible says what the spirit says to the church what the message says so we're going to say what god's prophet said what the bible says and then we ought to be able to say amen as a church can you say amen amen let's try that one more time say amen amen amen so let's just treat the devil the devil's trying to get every one of us every one of us are fighting a battle that nobody else knows about so let's just come into the house of the lord let's help our brother preach don't let him preach alone let's just say amen amen well i told him just deliver whatever's on his heart and then we'll have the communion together there's that little song i have decided to follow jesus how many have decided to follow jesus amen amen i'm not turning back let's sing it together i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus i have decided hallelujah [Laughter] [Music] the world behind me hold across me for me thank you before me the world behind me no turning back [Applause] no turning back i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus i have decided [Applause] [Music] i hope that we burn all the bridges behind us there's nowhere to go but forward amen amen god before us amen as paul said looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith amen god bless you tonight it's certainly a pleasure to be to me is back home it's actually 28 years under brother green's ministry and about 18 in in ministry and uh with as associate minister

hallelujah [Music] god it's my prayer he's so good and god loves me so yes god loves me so oh god loves me so we in my younger years i always thought that god was mad at me that he always looked at me with a frown because i knew i wasn't living the way i should or because i didn't quite measure up but you know i found out one day he loves me no matter what the day you find that out in your own personal life he'll mean something different to you it's no longer whether you measure up or not amen it's his grace and this mercy that is unending amen if you ever bibles tonight like to turn to hosea chapter 10 verse 12. my message tonight is i i've titled it a call to prayer there in hosea 10 12 it says sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your fellow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and reign righteousness upon you father tonight lord as we try to bring this message lord we want to get out of the way lord and let your holy spirit be here to be the one to speak be the one to help us receive lord we open our hearts to you lord we open our our our our minds our soul all that we are to your presence is this evening lord we commit to service in your hands we ask the lord to be you lord god and only you who speaks tonight speak to our hearts i pray and bless each heart that's been made the effort lord to be here tonight lord we appreciate that so much thank you jesus for all your blessings amen for all the wonderful mothers that are here tonight lord may you bestow a special blessing on every one of them tonight lord we thank you father for our own mothers some of our mothers have already gone on they're up there with you in glory lord waiting for us one day we're going to see them again we're going to shake their hand we're going to hug them lord and father we know that it's it's soon coming father we know that your coming is at the door lord that is so near father we see the world in the conditioned sin lord it should wake us up lord as the prophet said it should put us into desperation seeing the times that we're living in lord help us father to to be in tune with your holy spirit in every day lord god and all that we do we ask it in jesus christ's name and the church said god bless you and be seated tonight some time ago i was reading the bible before going to work and i was reading there in second corinthians chapter 10 verses three and four and i've read that many many times and the brothers could put it on on the on the board there uh you know you can read a scripture all your life and one day you read it and it will just jump out of the page at you and i looked at it and i'd never noticed before where it says for the weapons of our warfare though we walk in the flesh we wore not after the flesh amen we're not fighting with an m16 or hand grenade it is a spiritual warfare i heard brother brown saying the tape this morning that our our armor is spiritual because the battle is spiritual amen but that spiritual will can destroy your life here on earth if you're not careful and it says there though it says though we walk in the flesh we wore not after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god and i never noticed it before i'd read it i've memorized it and reading it that morning i saw the word weapons and i said weapons it's a plural more than one weapon and i know that the word of god is likened unto a weapon amen is the sword of the spirit for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two widget sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and there's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so we know that this word is god this this word of god is a weapon if you ever heard the message the greatest battle ever fought you have a better understanding of this of this word and how it is to be utilized as a weapon and i was reading that i said lord i said weapons and i never thought about that i said what other weapons are there i'm praying i'm meditating talking to god said lord what are the weapons and immediately he impressed upon my heart where brother branham said when the weakest saint gets on his knees before god satan trembles and i thought wow that's a weapon that is a weapon and i and i began to preach it to my church i said this is a weapon and i began to bring a series on it and and and it wasn't until later some months later i happened to find this little pamphlet in my bookshelf just collecting dust there and it's called a call a call to prayer and then there are quotes from brother branham about prayer and he talks about this this this prayer being more powerful than a hydrogen bomb than an atom bomb greatest weapon that ever been placed in the hands of humans just quote after quote not knowing the prophet has said these things and i believe in my spirit sometimes you don't you don't need to hear the prophet say it in your spirit you receive something that sounds right that sounds true why because the holy spirit in you will say amen to every word of god some people might stand back and say well i don't know if the prophet said that but if you got the holy ghost amen and if that's the word of god that that spirit in you go say amen amen every time to that word of god and so i began to preach that and and if you if you get your bibles turned to isaiah 66 chapter one and two and there's something about prayer there's not just about praying but you know one of the things how we approach god in our prayer it's important we approach it in the right way you know we're we're coming unto the king of kings if you were going to approach the queen of of england how would you approach her there's a certain etiquette there's some way that you things you've got to do that it's expected of you when you when you when you step into her presence or when you leave her presence and and how much more god how much more god we gotta we gotta learn we need to know how to approach god and here isaiah 66 1-2 i believe is the key it says thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest you know we see jesus saying come unto me all you that are heavy laden and i will give you rest and we want that rest but here god's talking about his rest where is the place of my rest where can i come and live where's my house all those things have have been handmade saith and those things have been saith the lord you see we can say well god we we made this sanctuary for you but he made everything here the trees that made the lumber and everything that came out of the ground god created his all these things have a my have my hand made where is a house that you build unto me think about that but to this man will i look he's looking to a house even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word that's the kind of man and woman he's looking for humility amen real godly humility in first peter 5 verses 4 and 7 4 7 and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another until we begin to do that we we don't know what true humility is the bible says in philippians uh look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others not to live and strive not to be envious but to love one another be subject one to another he says be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace unto the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your cares upon him for he cares for you in the message thou knowest all things brother banham says now see what prayer does prayer is not exactly bringing god down to man and we always say well the presence of god just came down and and we say that and that's fine but brother bran says no it's not quite that way it's bringing man up to god see as you pray you lose you lose the sight of these earthly things he says you sway out into somewhere else wait i'm talking about breaking through now somewhere else way beyond and on and on and on till you till you come into his presence so what what happened is it's in it's in in heavenly places in christ jesus amen uh more scriptures on that james 4 7-10 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil how about a whole uh uh some sermons just on this just on these these scriptures right here draw an eye to god and he will draw an eye to you we're expecting god to draw an eye to us but there's something we have to do there's a part we got to we we need us to humble ourselves god's not gonna give us everything in a silver platter he'll set up before us but we've got to reach forth and we've got to take it he says draw night to god he will draw an eye to you and then here it is cleanse your hands you sinners you and purify your hearts you double-minded the bible says that a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways if you're double-minded change your ways ask god to come and change you be stable stand that the bible says god's looking for people that are going to take a stand as it says here in the ephesians stand there for having your lawyers girl about with truth amen that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil we're to stand and face the enemy the armor is only on one side it's not on the back for for those that turn and run it's get only in the front we stand and we face the enemy amen glory to god we're in a war you know that don't you this is the conflict we're in be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and what what will he do he will lift you up that's how we approach him in humility in humility just lord i'm nothing lord god i don't know lord i made a lot mess of my life lord help me god i don't know what to do will you just guide me will you just show me the way lord please lord i need you i don't know i don't know what to do i don't know where to turn come to him on a basis like that humble yourself approach unto him in humility to this man while i look even to him that is broken a contrite spirit amen of a broken heart one time brother branham was in the woods and and he went and he felt he wanted to talk to the lord he wanted to be in this presence and so he bowed his head and he's sitting on the stump i think and nothing happens and so then he he's by himself out there in the woods and he kneels down gets on his knees before god still nothing then he said he laid himself prostrate on the on the ground on the floor just laid himself out in just humility and immediately his presence he lifted him up into his presence we gotta know how to come in i'll come unto him in ephesians chapter two verse six and it raises up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus in the message perfect strength by perfect weakness in 61 he says i hope that gets down deep to us both here and the tape world too that you realize that you've got to become nothing not a know-it-all not a great somebody but a nobody you got to come to dust are you hearing me people you've got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing and don't never rise above it for as soon as you rise above it listen to this you rise above god that damascus rode dust that paul fell into brother brown said you got to lay there don't rise above it because the minute you rolls up above that dust you're risen above god you've got to keep yourself in the dust on the road to damascus you've got to keep yourself off your high horses and that is for everyone for those who are here and everywhere in those tapes amen i can say amen to that in the message god keeps his word in 57 he says we should be unfolding god's spirit pouring out not just one little gusher not one little baptism some of us that's all we've gotten maybe it's carried us this far but we need more i need more of god how many need more of god how many mean business with god amen he says not just one little baptism but baptism after baptism and i believe it's possible i believe we can become a book of acts church amen book of ash believers baptism after baptism bible says they would get together and they would pray and the house would shake with the power of the holy ghost that's the gospel that we believe that's the one we're following tonight amen he says why we ought to he says but he says let me read this again but baptism after baptism not a revelation not a revelation just live by faith or or sanctification or the gifts of the spirit but revelation after revelation power after power glory after glory why we ought to be way up the road ready for translation can we say that the same thing tonight brother danny we ought to be way up the road hold on how much more are we going to go around the mountain it's got to come on time we got to set our faces towards god amen and sell out everything amen he says we're till we're ready for translation and we're lingering back in the old things and saying well well keep going back we'll keep going back let's go forward no no let's just go forward amen stop going around that mountain event do something different get out of your comfort zone whatever it takes pay the price die out to yourself amen talking about humility in these things i was reading one time a book i stole from my sister irma who's sitting back there she lent me a book and i'll tell you anything don't ever let me your books because i'll never give them back brother green was the same way i learned some of mine i never saw them again but he said he says here in this book written by frank bartleman in the sister street he says the whole place talking about that the the the the the the great visitation there in 1906 the revival he says the whole place was steeped in prayer god was in his holy temple it was it was for a man to keep silent the chicano glory rested there in fact some claim to have seen the glory by night over the building brother larry i don't see him here tonight but he gave me a testimony back during that revival there was a little mission there in california where some believers had gathered to to to pray and the holy ghost came down inside that little building people on the outside saw the building they saw the pillar fire coming over that building they called the fire department to come put out the fire i'm talking about that kind of a book of accident man being written over again he said the whole place was steeped in praise i i have stopped he said there's a kind of glory rested there in fact something they've seen the glory by night over the building i do not doubt it i have stopped more than once within two blocks of the place and prayed for strength before i dared go on can you imagine having services like that before you come in here you'd stop and say oh god i'm coming to your presence lord help me i come in nonchalant chewing gum and talking about the thinking oh coming into the presence of jehovah lord god almighty creator of heavens and earth he says i'll be there amongst you two or three gather there i will be in your midst amen how many believe it tonight glory glory pray for strength before i go there go on the presence of the lord was so real presumptuous men would sometimes come among us especially preachers who would try to to spread themselves in self opinion but their effort was short-lived the breath would be taken from them their minds would wander their brains real things would turn black before their eyes they could not no one cut them off we simply prayed the holy spirit did the rest we wanted the spirit to control we he wound them up in short order they were carried out as dead spiritually speaking they generally bit the dust and humility going through the process we all had gone through in other words they died out came to see themselves in all their weakness then in childlike humility and confession were taken up of god transformed through the mighty baptism of the spirit the old man died with all his pride arrogancy and good works that's why the preachers died hard they had a lot of good works you know your own good works can hinder you did you know that i never understood that until i read this i put two and two together i said wow no wonder god says that our our most righteous deeds are as filthy rags i never could understand that how could our righteous deeds be filthy rags not that the deed is filthy but what it causes us to think in our mind of ourselves because we've done the good deed we began to think of ourselves as pretty good i'm pretty good guy i'm pretty good person look what i did you know that can hinder you you got to remain humble i hear the prophet of god with who stood in places for thou 10 times times thousands were healed in one hour he was in meetings where ten thousand times thousands came to the lord and the saving grace of jesus in one meeting yet i hear him say here i am lord your unworthy servant your unworthy servant and that's what we are brothers we're unworthy we're unworthy to preach to the blood blood-bought saints of god we're unworthy amen may we never think that because of what we've done oh i've preached this and i've preached over there and i've done this that could be a hindrance to our life not not the deed how we perceive it in our own life can be a hindrance in our own life old men died with all this pride arrogance seeing good works in my own case i came to abhor myself i could never understand where jesus says in john chapter 12 verses 24 and 25 verily verily i say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and though we walk in and and oh and he that loveth his life shall lose it he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life and i never could understand that scripture how why would we have to hate our life and hear i hear this man say when they came into that presence and they began to see themselves began to abhor their own selves hate their own life in my prayer i've laid there sometimes i say god how can you even stand me so i i fought the battle all day long and i i try to be victorious and everything yet as i'm laying there in this presence these things come to me of things maybe i said or thought or whatever and i say lord how can you even stand me lord i begin to abhor myself my life i say god let me die out that's when we began to really realize we need a dying out we need the brother branson we need to die now for the pulpit clear out to the janitor's closet amen every one of us are included in that in my own case i came to abhor myself i begged the lord to drop a curtain so close behind me on my past that it would hit my heels amen i can say amen to that for though we walk in the flesh we wore not after the flesh for the weapons of our for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god the reason what's happened with us as christians many of us we've we no longer believe in prayer like we should that's the reason many many of us don't pray brother bryan said many christians don't even pray until they come into church you know we should always pray that the first scripture i gave always wherever we go there's that kind of a prayer where you'll be driving the road on the down the road now no brother erin driving down the road he's praying i do the same thing you do the same thing my sister might be washing the dishes doing your things around the house and you're in prayer but there's a different kind of prayer that that we need in our life and that's where jesus said when you go to your closet and you close the door behind you and you kneel down and you begin to look for his presence in that kind of prayer there's something about that prayer and what i want to say this this evening is that many of us have left prayer because we stopped believing in it brother branham said in the message greatest battle ever fought talking about the word of god and i'm have to i'm just going to skip around in my i've got it right here as a matter of fact here in the greatest battle of her father he says see his attack watch listen close this closing his attack is what disbelieving god's word not believing in the word of god see that's his attack there you can see the greatest battle ever fought there's only two forces satan and god and what is satan's weapon against you listen to this though what is satan's weapon against you you know brother branson said a baxter against and he he studies the tactic of of his opponent whether he's a southpaw how he fights is he a boxer is you're just a man just burrows in he studies his tactics we need to study the tactics of our enemy and brother brandon said you see his tactics he says what what is satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon are you hearing me tonight we're talking about prayer brother obama's you're talking about the word of god but that applies to our prayer as well he's gotten us to disbelieve that our prayer is any good because if we believe truly believed in prayer every one of us would be prayer warriors tonight you see we spend more time in prayer than anything else in our life he gets you to disbelieve that weapon is to try to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you he lis let's listen real quiet now listen he says if he if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he can get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough your prayer not strong enough he has disarmed you oh brother and evil he says i hope we never leave that i hope and pray not look he's disarmed you and when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay down lay that down that finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon don't lay it down talk about the weapon of the sword of the word of god he said you take that word he says and you and you slash that devil he says and you slash him again and you whack him again he says this is he says whack and you whack him again and you whack him again and you whack him again by his stripes i am healed by his strength he's a healer of all of my diseases by his stripes i am healed satan did you hear me by his stripes i am healed you whack them again you whack them again you crack them again your warfare you think that doesn't do anything to the devil oh your way your head does it makes them back up he said you cut that devil to pieces and after you're done with that devil you step forward and you say now where's the next one amen we're fighting the spiritual battle there's there's a there's a an arsenal against us amen there are there are millions of them against us in that other dimension we don't see them but we see their works we feel them sometimes amen they come into our mind with their thoughts we're fighting a battle and that's what we do with prayer we begin to believe again that prayer amen prayer changes things amen god listens to my prayer glory be to god amen there was a something came up with facebook some year some about a year or two ago and it was a picture of a a black sister she must have been me upc because she looked she looked like a message woman she's on her knees and long dress and beautiful long hair on her back and she's got her hands up raised up in the air and you know she's broken through i mean she's arched back and she's jesus the presence of jehovah and that was that kind of impacted me when i saw that picture i said praise god look at that but then what it said underneath caught my attention and i said this is how i fight my battles think about that this is how i fight we think we fight the battle out there who are out there in the world and temptation comes no your battle was fought in your knees in your closet that's where you won the victory are you following me this is how i fight my battles it may look like i'm surrounded amen but i'm surrounded by you glory to god this is how i fight my battles amen that's where you armor up that's where you put on the spiritual armor there in the morning before you go out that door you find the time you make the time it takes discipline you're not gonna let satan's not gonna say okay you got you got some time to pray now at least you pray no he's not going to let you pray you've got to make the time in your life you've got to set the routine in your life and the discipline in your life that you're going to have that time of prayer i told the church one time you know you got to take all this old flesh and you and by the holy spirit take over this this land right here amen because this whole flesh don't want to go to church old flesh don't want to go to church so what you got to do you're going to say flesh you're going to church because they're assembling themselves together tonight and i'm going to be there amongst them amen it's not about some oh my favorite preacher's gonna be there or the preacher i don't want to hear it has nothing to do with it you better go there because god's gonna be there if you believe god's word god says he will be there that should be enough to get you down here amen and tell old flesh you're going to church you've got to tell old flesh flesh you're going to go pray flesh don't want to pray is that right am i the only one here can i get a witness on that flesh don't want to pray flesh don't want to serve god flesh don't want to witness flesh don't want to do any of that amen it takes the spirit of god in us but we've got to surrender to that spirit to have the power and the strength to overcome this one right here when you stand there in the mirror in the morning especially your brother's a shave in the morning you're looking at your worst enemy right there he's staring back at you that old flesh you gotta you gotta you've got you've gotta dominate that flesh by the holy ghost amen jesus said when you pray pray or pray that you enter not into temptation and joel almost isn't finishing now almost four minutes here well not really he said to take my liberties so you can blame brother daniel in joel chapter 2 verse 12 through 19 says therefore also now saith the lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping why does it always say that why is it what is this about the mourning and the weeping and the heavy heart having our joy turn to heaviness what is it we're crying out because we know if the more spiritual you'll get the more you begin to realize how what kind of a fight you got ahead of you and how hard it is and we come before him weeping and crying saying lord help me i want to overcome this flesh i want to be an overcomer lord we come with fasting i preached a very very difficult message a few weeks ago and i and i said this i heard brother green say this one time he said what did you invest in the service tonight what was your investment was it more than just getting ready putting on the shirt and the tie and picking the right blouse and the right shoes go with this with a dress and comb your hair and or were you preparing the inner man to come to service what did you invest this this evening and i came and i saw brother daniel on his knees are praying there with all his heart and he's making an investment we need to start making investments in the service as believers we're not children anymore amen you know children they give them they have to give them milk we should be coming the coming of age there's a maturity that's going to come to us as believers i've seen people serving 30 years god's 30 40 years and they're still babes in christ they never grew they never matured there's got to be a maturity in us and it comes from the through the battles that we fight when we lay on our knees before god all night and i said how many how many have ever prayed all night when was the last time you fasted three days when was the last time you went out and witnessed what was the last person that you ever brought to the foot of the cross through your witness scene well that's a pastor's job no it's all our jobs you see there are so many things that we fall short on but i believe we get everything everything straight in our lives and we begin to come back to a life of prayer amen we're going to have it it's to live a life of a victory to be an overcomer of this age this is the most over deceiving age has ever been amen we are we are to be we should be matured by now brother branstad i just gave that quote we should be so far along right now and we're not because our every maturity we don't learn we've got to learn let the holy spirit begin to teach us amen how to be a strong christian how to learn how to fight our battles up on our knees but the man said we need that more theology we need more neology be on our knees before god joel verse 13 says rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repented him of the evil in the message desperations brother brown says desperation signs of his coming should throw every member of christ into desperation now about our souls about our welfare for hereafter well what are we going to do to amount what are we going to amount to if we gain the whole world what are we what are we living for what that's a good question what are we living for what do you work for what are you eating for what are you struggling for to live what are you living for to die and you're not fit to live until you're fit to die it's true there's a time to weep in a time to laugh a time to mourn the bible says a time to dance we're in a time right now of mourning crying out we have loved ones that aren't saved there are those around us some are in need and we're still struggling because we don't sacrifice paul said in romans chapter 12 verse one he says i beseech you i beg of you i ask you please present your bodies a living sacrifice they used to bring the sacrifice in their arms to the priests and they laid upon the altar and the priest would take that knife and he'd slit that animal's throat and the little animal began to kick because they wanted to live and the blood began to spurt out all over the believer blood everywhere he would bring a sacrifice but now we come to the altar this is an altar we come to the altar we're not bringing a sacrifice we are the sacrifice you are the sacrifice you're coming here to die that's what an altar is for that's where you die you lay there you die in that dust amen you lay there in that door you stay there don't ever get up you of course you have to get up from this place but in your heart in your spirit in your experience don't ever rise above that damascus road dust remain there in humility dying out to yourself amen disciplining your life in the message blind bartimaeus in 57 brother brandon says you know there's something about getting alone to yourself many people never pray until they come to church many people think that's the only place to praise the church but the bible said for men to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands and then we when we get to by ourself we're usually we'll usually pray different than we would if we prayed in church it's a secret prayer that jesus spoke of saying enter ye into the secret closet and close the door and when you have did so pray to your father who sees in secret and he that seeth in secret shall reward you openly and when we're when we're praying like that there seems to be something to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out of it it seems like it we get it in a better connection with god to get alone and there's been many times in my life brother bram talking saying this as perhaps in your life that you just have to get alone once in a while with jesus i took my car and drove down the road and just studying and after i got to the highway where it was free or often some country road until i would become so filled with his mercies and goodness till i just stopped the car and held the wheel and wept like a baby in the presence of [Music] troubles vanish my heart is mended some of us need that in the presence of the king amen goes on he says that being alone many times i've climbed up into the mountains where every man thought was with me i was going hunting go up there and sit down on a rock and just look up to the sky until i looked like my whole innermost being become filled with something that you could just feel oh everything of the world seemed to pass away oh for those precious hours alone with god oh it's there that when the greatest revelation and inspiration comes is when we're alone with god we take more time on that i'm sure that we would live a better life more victorious in christ this is how i fight my battles when you kneel down early in the morning before you go to work before you go to school take that extra time take an hour whatever you can take so you can read your bible alone pray get on your knees and prepare your heart because you're going to step out that door and satan will be waiting for you right there the battle will begin but you've already won your battle if you laid before god in prayer that's your strength amen and before i turn it over brother daniel i'd like to give just a couple of quotes on brother branham a few quotes here in expectation 1950 says prayer that i depend on that's the secret of all the mysteries of god that's the key that opens the door to everything of god is prayer if you pray and believe when you pray then believe that you will receive what you have asked for and god will make it known and believing god 1952 so therefore that's the reason said the prayer of faith shall save the sick an individual's prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much oh if you only knew that in your hand christ gave us the authority with his name by being christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it even changes everything it will change the mind of god my angel shall go before thee 53. the christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty god in the name of jesus christ he doesn't realize what power that is do you now believe 53 prayer is the most powerful weapon was ever put in the hand of mankind believe us all this 1950 if we fail to pray through daily and i want you to listen to this one this is very important if we fail to pray through daily all the time keep under the blood you'll wither up and die in your christian experience too many people are running on empty too many christians too many passage people are drained spiritually and they're running they're going through the motions they're coming to church they sing the songs but they're empty on the inside you don't have to stay that way tonight amen god is here you can churn your ways and call on his name the bible says calling him all he is near amen he'll answer you you'll stand with me tonight as i turn it over let's sing the song in the presence of jehovah if you want to be prayed for tonight i told brother daniel i think every service should be open to ministry anybody who needs prayer someone who's looking for victory in his life or her life don't be ashamed amen we're all we're all human beings we all fail ain't none of us here perfect i told my church when i first started there i said i'm uh i don't know everything i don't and i'll make i'm gonna make mistakes when i do just forgive me help me pray for me whoever if brother daniel becomes your pastor or whoever may be your pastor that you'll pray for him he's gonna make mistakes he's not perfect we're all imperfect man but the wonder of it all is that there's a perfect god living in an imperfect vessel that's me and that's you all of us imperfect but there's a perfect god that doesn't make mistakes that comes to live in us if you want prayer tonight don't be ashamed come on get your blessing amen we come here to be blessed amen how many want to be blessed get out of your comfort zone tonight nobody's looking at you just god you you're all by yourself close your eyes bow your head if you would and it's just you right now and him just you and him mama's not there daddy's not there your brother's not there your wife your husband's not

all of us amen i appreciate the word tonight amen did it touch your life amen it never ceases to amaze me how that the lord can take gifts and mend them so close together brother robert the things we've been talking about i think it was wednesday talking about our weapons the word of god and prayer being our weapons i was thinking about that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much james 5. no matter what the devil says your prayer avails much he said we shouldn't be like children anymore babies but we should be growing growing up amen god help us to grow up some of us well they say little children don't drink coffee it'll stunt your growth oh my spiritually we can preach a whole sermon there hey don't watch that movie it'll stunt your spiritual growth don't get involved with that person that'll stunt your spiritual growth don't get listen to that music it'll stunt your growth and then your mama said look that boy ain't drinking no coffee a little boy that'll stun his growth how much we as christians ought to say lord i'm not getting involved in that that'll stunt my growth as a christian and then this morning we talked about a time we brought a time to laugh a time to weep amen god just it's just one body of christ and god knits all these gifts together we get together the musicians and the song leader they get together in the back and they pray together and say lord merge our spirits together then the song leader comes over and we pray there and say lord let it just not one gift it's all of us as a body every joint supplies together each one that's with the special songs i didn't get that this morning now it's just not the minister is anointed or the song leader but now the anointing's in the people and you say god put this song in my heart we open a little special time up and there's a season you come and you sing a special it's all of us together amen the bible says one plants another waters and god gives the increase amen we're going to switch to the communion service amen let's just have a word of prayer maybe there's someone that has to go we have an open communion service anyone that wants to participate that's living a life above sin and sins are under the blood we welcome you to the communion let's just bow our heads heavenly father as we have appreciated the word tonight it's touched our hearts and lord we just pray god that the word that's been spoken would go deep father the prayer life i pray that you would help us i was thinking of psalms 91 david said thou art my god and early will i seek thee help us lord early in the morning before the thoughts of the day and social media and all those thoughts come into our minds help us to seek you and read our bibles and pray lord while our mind which is a fertile ground in the morning when it's fresh help us to put good thoughts in it as our brother robert has encouraged us to read our bibles and to pray and take time to put good thoughts in our garden of our mind that they might grow during the day help us lord lord as we change the communion service lord a time to commune and communicate and fellowship with you i pray that you would bless this time lord we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen if you have your bibles we'll just read psalm corinthians chapter 11 first corinthians chapter 11. amen paul says here in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 talking about the communion he said for i received the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take e this is my body which is broken for you this endue in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrances of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death until he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink of this cup unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup he that eateth and drinketh unworth worthily eateth and drink a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if you we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry it means to wait for one another terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come amen we're just going to change the order of the service now if the brothers will come and we'll prepare to take the communion and what we've done if brother brother ed will usher you down as many people as we can in the front and then we have the bread and the wine and i know we've done it a little different in the past maybe with one cup i think brother random's done it both ways individual cups and with the one cup tonight we're going to have it with the individual cups just trying to be cautious with the pandemic and so if you just come whether ed will usher you up and then if you'll just come and brother arnie will serve the bread across and then brother aaron will serve the wine across amen we'll just pray over the sacraments at this time isn't it good to be in god's house and take communion amen jesus said this do and remembers me until i come now we know christ came in word for him when we understand the son of man appearing that he appeared but he said he's going to come again and catch us away and my feet are still on the ground so amen we still got to do this until he comes that's what the bible says amen let's pray over this this bread first heavenly father i hold in my hands this bread lord that has been made by human hands and now we just sanctify it lord to your use to the communion service lord it's made unleavened father it's there's no leaven of the world in it father and as we come to you lord we want there to be no worldliness among us lord we confess our sins to you our mistakes knowing there's none righteous among you for us father but we're pleading your blood tonight over each one of our sins over the lives that are here lord you said this is my body that was broken for you lord in a communion time lord our lives should have been broken our will our mind broken father not our will let your will be done and as we commune in this lord i pray there will be a true communion father maybe some here come from a broken family and others made a decision not to serve you and they have a broken life today lord and i pray god you would just bless them there would be a time of fellowship father with you and i pray you bless this bread and sanctify it lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen we just pray over the wine now heavenly father we pray over this wine in the name of jesus christ father pray that you would sanctify it lord we pray lord that each one of us would have a revelation of what this represents lord the blood of jesus christ that cleanses us from all sin lord as brother dylan sang the song tonight how fitting lord for the communion the blood that you shed will never lose its power father till the last one is dipped in that great clorox of the blood these names are written on the lamb's book of life father i pray god when we take this communion tonight lord everyone that's discouraged would become encouraged lord the scripture says they shall wait upon the lord he'll renew their strength lord we've been through some dark times and some weary deserts but tonight lord in this communion i pray that you would renew our joy father you renew our strength god in the name of jesus lord let there be a communion lord you said if any man hear my voice and will open the door of his heart i will come into him and sup with him and commune with him lord that's your promised word and as we take your commandments you told us to do it we do it tonight i pray you'd bring a great joy in every heart a great renewing a great refreshing lord blessed this time lord we pray we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen amen praise the lord amen if the brother of jordan will lead us into some songs there will just be reverent amen you may be seated as the brother comes and ushers you front just reverently just come just be in prayer amen as brother ed would come and usher you in and then if you'll just take your cup with you don't put it back in the tray and as you go exit maybe around the sides the left and right just put your cup there their disposables just put them in the little trash can they've provided amen brother jordan if you if you just stand in front of the benches there and then the brothers will have time [Music] my [Music] the [Music] god bless you as you return to your [Music] seats [Music] it's me [Music] be my glory for me [Music] a [Music] it seems to be [Music] is [Music] my [Music] shoes [Music] god bless you returned your sins [Music] is [Music] is my [Music] me search [Music] oh god [Music] try me [Music] somewhere [Music] from [Music] free [Music] me [Music] thy world [Music] is may god [Music] is [Music] take my life and make it more [Music] myself [Music] is [Music] me [Music] from [Music] start the [Music] me i will survive may god bless you [Music] oh house [Music] so [Music] i can't is [Music] the sun of god [Music] i am [Music] he speaks the sound of his voice is so sweet hush [Music] that he gave to me [Music] is [Music] is and the joy we share as we tear amen let's stand together saint john chapter 13 verse 2. this is the scripture of the foot washing st john chapter 13 verse 2 aren't you glad that everything that you do comes from the bible jesus only gave us three ordinance water baptism communion and foot washing that we had to do verse number two and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him and jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet to wash them with the towel wherewith he was disguised then cometh he to simon peter and peter said that him lord dost thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter simon sayeth unto him thou shalt never wash my feet you know you learn there you never say never never say never peter said you're never i'm never you're never gonna wash my feet jesus answer him if i wash thee not thou has no part with me now peter expressed what a true son or daughter of god when the word corrects you his reaction to that was lord simon peter saith the name lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head amen whatever the word of god ask you to do let's do it verse number 10 jesus saith unto him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and year clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet now when your master says you ought to do this parent tells your child you ought to take the trash out hey you need to take some vitamins jesus is saying here you ought to wash one another's feet i believe as christians we ought to do it don't you think so what about people that don't take the communion told peter said you don't have any part with me and he told him you ought to do this you ought to do this as a minister of the gospel he said you ought to be washing feet you ought to be part of the communion service verse number 15 for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen praise the lord as we change the order of the service and we just go to the communion maybe we just not have it preset that the sisters would be downstairs in the room here the brothers will go upstairs go through the hallway and come to the uh the chapel area there we just ask that all the brothers would go there whether you're taking the communion or not if you'll just gather there to be good time to be together not a time of fellowship but just a time to wash one another's feet and we as the brothers we tarry one for another we have the foot washing and then we join and we pray together i don't know how you sisters maybe some of your elder sisters can cause that to happen here if you just not as a time of fellowship but we go and we humble ourselves we find someone we wash their feet they wash your feet and then we tarry for one another and when we're done we just join together and maybe some sister elder sisters sister gary senior sister here with brother aaron and and if you just take charge of sisters and then pray together the bible says pray ye one for another bear ye one another's burdens amen then we'll gather back down here just for maybe a couple of short testimonies i think that would be good we just had maybe have some short testimonies together and uh i think before they had mentioned some were in the sanctuary when they opened the door so we just asked the brothers maybe we would not be in the sanctuary where the sisters are washing feet right there amen praise the lord brother uh brother ed would you just ask the blessing as we change the order of the service brother ed dougal could you if you want to come up here you can or there if you can pray loud that will be fine yes as you go that little song down at the cross where my savior died sin i cried there to my heart was the blood of light o glory to his
