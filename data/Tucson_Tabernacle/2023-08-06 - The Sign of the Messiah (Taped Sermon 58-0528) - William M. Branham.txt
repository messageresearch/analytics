presence of the Lord this morning I believe that we're in the Lord's will and in doing what we're doing and following the leading having brother Eli Minister for us and I felt like the Lord told me something as I said I felt like it I felt a Feeling that the Lord was leading me for tonight's service and I have all of my notes here and I don't believe that he wants me to minister on this tonight um I don't know sometimes you you just want to do you want to do what the Lord wants you to do and you put this together and you work all the way up to the end and then he says no and his nose are just as good as his yeses I was I was so bla blessed this morning brother Eli in his subject on prayer brother Eli did not know that I was planning on having the people come for prayer this morning and yet he preached on that and lifted the people's faith and then the people came and I believed that there were many that received what they were asking for this morning we put God first brother Eli some of the things that he said they really struck my heart and what he said he said he says pray first and then you might not have to pray later to clean up the mess that you made and you know the young Brothers was talking about prayer and and talking about the time that we spent he said that Jesus had a Ministry of three and a half years three and a half years a short space of time and yet he spent that time in prayer 30 30 years old when he began preaching the gospel and how much prayer was there from that time until 30 years old and yet during that Ministry that was to change the world and bring Salvation he spent it in prayer so how important is praying how important is it to put these things before the Lord and and say Lord whatever you want but I'm going to spend this time and he's and he said this he said if you spend hours in prayer with God then you'll spend seconds dealing with man and then he likened it he talked about all of this time and and as he was talking I was thinking about I was thinking about a sprinter and an athlete and how much that they train and how much that they work and and and what they go through the hours every day of sprinting and and doing the different exercises and that all for 10 seconds on the track 10 seconds it's over and all of that time spent in training and that's how prayer is we pray and we spend all this time trying to get ready and and Lord and seeking the Lord and people were coming through the prayer line this morning and they were seeking God with all that heart and many of them said but I just can't break through I can't I can't I can't get past something Maybe maybe that thing that you're trying to get past maybe that's called the second coming of the Lord maybe that is the rapture and when we can all get to that place through prayer if we can get to that place will go up but we will never be content but Andy if we're content why would we want to pray why would be a there would be such a desire a burning desire to pray if we have everything that we need it's God's way he wants us to spend this time in prayer he wants us he wants our dedicated time as the athlete he needs that that athlete needs that time in training or he'll fail he won't win but if he spends the time if he works hard then a few seconds and he's won the race and the same with us with these people coming in the prayer line how much do we owe those people especially the brothers standing up here how much do we owe these people this time in prayer all of those hours for just a few seconds someone coming that needs healing someone coming that needs Deliverance someone coming that needs their family back we need to spend that time we owe it to one another it is prayer is the most important thing as our brother said this morning it's the most powerful weapon ever to ever placed in the hands of man is prayer Jesus Christ himself the son of God prayed all night long before he chose his disciples what an example our lord Jesus was to us pray or is that pray pray the only way to bring to reach Higher Ground I love it what's the rest of it sister surely pray pray the prayer of faith bring God's blessings down amen and it's the same with us pray try to find the will of God and and another thing the brother said this morning he says that we're always trying to find the hand of God we always need our healing we always need deliverance we always need this but instead of always trying the hand of God why don't we seek the will of God if we were seeking the will of God at first then we wouldn't necessarily need the hand of God later we would be in his will and that's my desire that's that's my desire for this church Lord let us be in your will whatever it is and I was this morning as I was standing about right here and I was looking out at the people worshiping and and I was just feeling the presence of the Holy Spirit I said Lord what do you want me to do and I even told some of the brothers um that I don't feel necessarily that this message that I have today would be good to follow that that we had this morning and the Lord confirmed it I don't think he wanted it either well thank God thank God I want to be in his will if we and if we walk if we walk in that will then everything the Seas the Seas the ocean will part it'll wall up on both sides and we'll walk through on dry ground as it has happened with the children of Israel same thing happened with Elijah and Elisha they came up to this Jordan River it was swollen Elijah took off his mantle he smote it the water dried up and across they went then here comes then Elijah goes up in the chair Here Comes Elisha he has the same mantle Elijah's gone he he threw down his mantle to Elijah Elisha Elisha walks up there to that river that now had water in again and what did he say where is the god of Elijah and the same God did the same thing and he'll do the same thing for us he will always do it if we will put our faith in him and we will spend that time in prayer I have in my notes they're sitting back there I wrote down in all capital letters I will pray more and I will it just it just so on my heart pray bring this these things before the Lord before they happen pray before you have problems when times are good Pray when times are bad Pray when you're driving home pray before you go to sleep Pray when you wake up Pray when you're going through the day pray talk to the Lord the Lord Jesus the the Bible tells us right at the very beginning of the book in Genesis the Bible tells us that God our brother said it this morning that God created man in his own image so with me with my children I'm a Man created in the image of God so does that mean God has feelings you bet it does if I have feelings I made in His image so how do I want my children to be with me I've been missing my boy my girl lately my son's at the camp and my my girls in Jeffersonville and I just I love them so much and I just want to talk to them I love them and it makes me feel so good when they call me when they want to talk to me I'm daddy his father and we are his children why don't we talk to him why don't we call him he's easier than getting on your phone Lord I need to talk to you I want I want to talk to you Lord listen to me I told the story about when Daniel was little and you know he was this little guy and and he had a funny speech you couldn't understand what he was saying and and he would grab Stephanie's face or my face when he was a little guy he wanted us to hear him and he would grab his face and say mommy listen to me daddy listen to me and we listened to the little guy and that's how we are with the Lord Jesus we get down on our knees and say father father listen to me and you know what he loves us more than we love our children we are not even capable of love like he is capable of love how beautiful how beautiful is our father so much so that he went through all of these thousands of years being up there and he could not have fellowship with us there was this gulf of sin that separated God from his children by his own law there was this separation that God couldn't have that Fellowship that he wanted to with man he only came down once a year in the temple my brother what's your name right here from uh from Louisville what's your name brother God bless you welcome welcome my brother I I um they told me that that you were here and I just want to welcome you to the Tabernacle brother he was separated from us through this veil of sin then once a year one time a year they would go in the the high priest just one person just one man would represent all of the human race he would go into the tabernacle into the holy of holies behind this thick curtain go back there and then the presence of God would come down one man one man and yet God wanted this fellowship with his people he needed it he he was their father he was our father and how he wants to talk to us How He Loves Us and then because he was a spirit up in heaven as I've said in the Book of Revelation it says that that he's up there and around his throne or a hundred thousand thousand two hundred thousand thousand Angels a hundred million angels surround his throne flying around and they're seeing holy holy holy unto the Lord and there he is up there Isaiah sees a vision of this and he sees that no man can come there or else he die and he Isaiah himself the prophet of God probably the most holy man in the whole world he goes and he says that I'm gonna die because I saw God this gulf of sin that's separated even the most righteous of all the people on Earth this man Isaiah could not even come into the presence of God without thinking that he was going to die years past and then finally God's plan came came to pass he was a spirit he said I am going to come down in flesh and fellowship with my people so he comes down he fellowships with his people and we've gone through the book of Acts and and and we see how God has moved among the people we go through the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John we see Jesus walking through for this three and a half years with his people and how much he loved them and he was teaching them he only had this three and a half years to teach him and yet as our brother said this morning he prayed he spent that time in prayer and then teaching and he taught them he said things that they never would have imagined he said things like like prefer your brother if somebody slaps you in the face turn the other side and let him slap that side they're like what that's not what Moses said Moses said an eye for an eye Jesus said no no that was a law there was no Grace there but then Jesus comes a man full of grace a man full of love he was the very essence of love he comes down three and a half years he preaches and then he goes to the cross dies for our sins way back when in the Garden of Eden we see there was a a woman named Eve a man named Adam and then there was this evil spirit that came in the form of this serpent a man can talk reason Eve comes before him they the serpent says you don't have to believe everything that God says God's a good God he wouldn't he wouldn't kill you if you do this he was afraid he fell she caused her husband he fell and then they're they're hiding in the bushes God's walking through the Garden of Eden he says Adam my son where are you Adam comes out and he says he's here he says I was embarrassed he said I was ashamed because I was naked God says wait a minute how did you know you were naked you were pure you were just a pure human being you were you were made in my image how do you know these evil things it came back to the serpent and there they are God looks at them and he goes to a defenseless animal probably a lamb and he kills it the first sacrifice four thousand years later Jesus is against sacrificed not in this time not to just stay the wrath of God but this time he made it to where God could not only communicate with not just the high priest over here behind the curtain but he made it to where he could enter in to the body of not just the high priest but the body of every single person who loves God that he could be with them all times prayer the prayer of Jesus Christ standing strong and Jesus Jesus prayed for his people that they would be one as he and the father are one and here we are together are we One Like Jesus prayed that we would be one are we reaching out that's what I wanted to talk about in my notes that and I will get to that at a different time but the prayer of Christ and then we see this man Paul come on the scene and Paul prayed and the things I was telling my wife this morning I was in tears he said Paul Paul goes and he says I have I have a leading to go to Jerusalem I want to get there I want to get there and I want a fellowship with my brethren and everybody was prophesying and saying don't go Paul don't go you're going to die if you go over there Paul said but I feel to go and then Paul made this statement he said I would that I would be lost rather than my brethren my Jewish Brothers in Jerusalem these people that treated him so badly these people that gave him problems he said I would rather that I would not even enter into the kingdom rather than have them be lost talk about the spirit of Christ on this man Paul and how he prayed and how he wanted to lift up this man Jesus Christ because he knew he knew if they would accept Christ that they would be saved and it was everything to Paul he loved people he wanted them to be saved and I look out at us brother where is our burden for people that they would be saved where is it and we see such a division if you don't see it like I see it then you don't matter I don't care about you a Christian Paul he said I would rather be lost than have these ones that have given me so many problems then then be lost do we have that same spirit we need it and it'll come through prayer when I was sitting there in the back and I was like Lord what do you want me to do you want me to minister on this and I felt no I went back I I stood back there with brother Lyle and I said no he doesn't want me to do it and I felt to listen to a sermon of a man who truly did pray a Man Who Loved God so much that he dedicated his life to serving others and that he would pray he and God would answer his prayer why because he spent the hours in the prayer in prayer for 10 seconds with a man in the prayer line or woman in the prayer line that was this man and that's the man that I want to hear tonight standing in the door right here I came to this place Lord I don't know what to do I can preach on another subject what do you want me to do walking up here and then our brother sings only believe if you don't know only believe is a song that brother William Marion Branham would come to the pulpit he sings it it was on My Heart Lord what do you want me to do my question is answered I want us to hear this man named William Branham tonight preach a sermon called The Sign of the Messiah brother Branham talked about the sign of the Messiah as being when Jesus many times it was when the woman with the blood issue came through touched His Garment he turned he said virtue has gone from me he knew the secrets of her heart he knew the secrets of the heart of the of the woman at the well he knew that she had sinned that she had all these husbands she was living in sin and he knew these things that was Jesus then we see Peter here after he's filled with the Holy Spirit you see we see ananias and Sapphira Come Peter knew that they had cheated God he showed that same sign that sign had been so rare and then boom it shows up again in our day that sign of God and it was a warning a warning that one day soon that our lord Jesus would return we don't have the whole sermon that I want to play tonight it ends at 32 minutes but I know because I've heard him so many times I know what happened after that and that is brother Branham started going through each each person and started showing that sign and Discerning and when the Lord Jesus is here just as Adam and Eve they were embarrassed and they were covering up themselves that's how we are before the Lord we can't hide anything and you don't want to hide anything you want that blood of Jesus Christ to cover you and the only way friends is to spend that time in prayer and the man that we are going to hear tonight spent the time in prayer that is this man William Marion Branham I'm so honored that I can introduce him he's gone the Lord saw fit to take him away but he left sermons for us to enjoy and to see to listen to these sermons and to see that God is still alive let's all stand my brother if you would lead us with our theme song [Music] all things are possible only believe my Lord [Music] all things are possible [Music] only be [Music] amen friends you can be seated 1958 May the 28th brother Madam preached this sermon he didn't do that he said the sun can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that's who it's a son lifeline the father worketh and I worketh hitherto for the Young Folks Jesus saw a vision what God wanted him to do and he just acted it out in drama you should have been with us at the dinner table today to watch the same thing take place now notice that's the scripture says that he spoke these words a little while and the world will see me no more that's the unbeliever yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world now is that true or isn't it true let's just talk it out and reason Among Us is that the truth ah as a personal pronoun I'll be with you in you until the end of the world a little while in the unbeliever the church world will be issued in and they'll see me no more but the church itself ye I'll be with you in you to the end of the age the world it hasn't come to the end yet so Christ Remains the Same now he said I am divine ye are the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit of itself it only purges the branches and the branches bears fruit do you know that well then if you went to a grapevine what would you expect to find great if you went to a watermelon vine you find watermelon if it's a fertile dime if you went to a peach tree you'd find peaches but then if you if Christ is divine and his members of the church is the branches what ought you to find in the church The Works that I do shall you also more than initial you do for I go to my father what do you find when you go to church we are the Presbyterian we are the Baptist we are the Pentecostals we got the message we got this that's not Christ Christ is love because he was God have this will all men know you're my disciples when you have loved one for the other but we won't go down to that meeting our church is not cooperating all right all the fathers did and it will come said Jesus now notice now let's search the scripture then and find out just what he did back there that the people would know that he was the Messiah and whatever he did then to prove to the people he was a messiah then he's got to do the same now or he isn't the same yesterday today and forever you believe that now we all know that we are churches says different all because it we uh have this denomination we have this charity those things are fine but that's not what Christ did and that's not what he said to do not at all so notice let's turn back we're reading and Saint John let's go back to the first chapter we're on the 12th let's go back to the first chapter and find out reason he amazes these quotations the way he did here all right thank God the first century we find out here that after he was baptized and the Holy Spirit was on him which was God and he had the spirit without measure we have it by Major here's the ID all the water that's out there in the ocean with the spirit that was in Christ watching us as a spoonful out of that ocean but the same tentacles are in the Spoonful that's in the entire ocean it's not as much of it he had it all the waters was in him and we have a spoonful here's what he was God made flesh into all Among Us he was Emmanuel but we are adopted children by his grace now after he had received the Holy Ghost in the fullness of the Holy Ghost where we received the baptism he received the fullness of the Holy Spirit now we find that immediately his ministry begins during Saint John 1. and there was a certain man who got saved and as quick as he got faith he went for his brother's Simon and he brought his brother back in the presence of the Lord Jesus and when Jesus saw him for the first time he told him what his name was and told him he was going to change it from Simon to Peter's season did he do that and he told him what his father's name was Jonas said thou or your name is Simon you're the son of Jonas I remember this is the first thing and Caesar was a ignorant and unlearned in name he never had any education he could not even sign his own name the Bible said he was ignorant and unlearned if education plays such a big part what about that and that man was given the keys to the kingdom of heaven where we gone to with all of our schools now I'm not saying we don't have them but you're putting too much emphasis on your education that's all right but that'll never save you don't watch it'll damn you education has been the greatest hinder since the gospel has ever had that's right because people try to outsmart it's the our criminal records when Captain Al Ferrar the head of the FBI the juvenile was converted in my meeting he said brother Graham your statement of that is true I'll take you right here to every juvenile cases happened in the past 10 years in the United States it's amongst the educated people right 90 of it is they're so smart they figure they can just outfigure the law and things like that that's why they're getting trouble and they think well we've got a great church we're a great name that isn't it you've got to be born again that is your loss completely no matter how good your team was as good as able worship the same as able build a church the same as able May the sacrifice the same disabling God rejected him because he didn't have the spiritual Revelation what was wrong Jesus set upon that same spiritual Revelation he had built his church in the Gates of Hell couldn't Prevail against it a spiritual reveal by the Holy Spirit now what's Jesus doing he's going to the Jews making himself known now as soon as it's taken place there was one named Philip he thought that was drilling so around the mountain he went for 15 miles and he found a friend of his by the name of Nathanael and Nathaniel when he found him was under a tree plane and he waited till Nathaniel finished praying and if perhaps when he got up he said hello get up glad to see he said come see who we found that's it not even time today how do you do glad to meet you is your wife all right he had a message and if the church ever gets that thrilled about Christ something will take place but we got all kind of Social and everything to go on no wonder we're dying certainly I am we're worried about Russia go to come over here and get don't worry about that it isn't a Rob and it pecks the Apple it hurts it it's the worm at the core that kills them it's our own rockness Among Us let's watch Gillian we were a real Christian backbone of men and women who stood forgotten instead of going to church on Wednesday night we stay home to watch rock and roll television and Arthur Godfrey and all these other people on the radio we love Susie it shows you love the world more than you love God if your heart's forgot God comes first is all of your heart Nathaniel said come see you we found Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and now he's I can just imagine here and say now wait a minute Philip you surely have gone off on the bad end of it you went off on the deep end I've known you to be a man of honest man and here you mean to tell me that you've gone off with something like that while you must have got into some fanaticism do you know Philip if that guy wasn't Messiah you know where he'd come to you he'd go to Jerusalem you go to the priests the high priest did say great campuses the high Priests of God we know you're the smartest man in the country the greatest religious man in the country and all you holy priests you know all the words he'd come there and he'd make himself known you Catholics think you'd go to the Vatican you prayers that you're in thank you go to the bishop your Pentecost thinks he goes to the state transmitter but he goes to who he to go to it's his business and he said could anything good come out of Nazareth don't give him the best answer that any man could give him he said come and see for yourself there's the way don't stay home and criticize go find out search it in the scriptures come find out for yourself on the road around the mountain I hear Nathaniel tension you know that old fisherman and she bought the fish from that time and couldn't sign the receipt yeah he come up before him the other day his name is Simon you know and he told him what his name was and told him what his father's name was or which surprised me if he didn't know who you were ah Phillip now Philip ah you can't tell me that stuff I'll make up my mind when I get there so when he walked up into the presence of Jesus for the first time Jesus looked around said behold in Israelite in whom there is no guile now he could have been an Arab he could have integrate they all dressed alike and looked like dark rates of people wearing beard turbans loose garment throat and besides that he could have been an Infidel he could have been a critic but he said you are a just man in whom there's no God and he looked at him he said Rabbi when did you know me this is the first time I've ever seen you you see me when did you ever know me you said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you what did that Jew say here's the here's the attitude of a real believer you looked at him he said you are the Son of God you are the king of Israel but there was those stood by the smart priests they said this man the eligible he's a fortune teller Jesus turned around and said this you speak that against me the son of man I'll forgive you but in other words there's coming a day when the Holy Ghost will come and when he does the same thing one word against it will never be forgiven in this world neither in the world to come how many knows the scripture says that right the unpardonable scene is the call the Holy Spirit the working of the Holy Spirit an unclean thing that you never can be forgiven for CE that Jesus now did you notice Jesus never done that to a gentile nor in presence of a gentle house because he he forget his disciples to go to the Gentiles and when the therapy open woman said to him come have mercy on my daughter he sees that he said I'm only not least for me to take the children's bread and cast it to the dog and she said yes Lord that's true I know that but the dog gets a crime he said there's great faith if you believed it that way go find it the same way it's all he said to her no vision for her that her own faith do it see now he did that and he forbid his disciples to do it now we know there's only three uh nationalities of people are racist people that's the Jew Gentile and the Samaritan which the Samaritan is a half Jew and Gentile you notice Peter with the keys to the kingdom he opened it to the Jews at Pentecost went down to Samaria up to the house of Cornelius never again was it used there's the three races of the world now he in his day he came to his own and his own received him not now those who made fun of him and said he was the algebra a devil or telepathy or a fortune teller or some evil spirit he said I'm going to forgive you for that then the Holy Ghost will never yet been poured out upon the nation that I'll forgive you but when the Holy Ghost has come not one word against it or it'll never be forgiven I now notice one day he went by the way of Samaria and what he did he had need go that way and he sent his disciples into the city to buy some food and there's a little place that our whale outside the city a little tamaranic and where the the public confidence where they go get their water and there's a window that runs over the pumpkin the ladies come out there with pictures it's got hooks to go around just let them down in the well and get the water and bring it up and set it on their head and one on each hips and walk right along talk and go on Jesus is waiting there for his disciples to return and while he was waiting let's say she was a pretty woman real pretty woman come walking out there she is a Samaritan and she started to let her pop down into the well to get some water and she heard someone said woman bring me a drink and she looked around and it was a Jew sitting there she said well we don't have any dealings with each other you are a Jew and I am a Samaritan a woman of Samaria in other words they had segregation racial differences but he let her know he's no different he said if you knew who you were talking to you had asked me for a drink and I'd bring you water you don't come here to draw or give you water I listen that was Jesus yesterday I was at the Samaritan Jew and Samaritans which was the outcasts they all breed I now watch again and she said do you mean that you're greater than our father Jacob he does the well see they claim God too he dug so well his children drink from it is cattle and here you say you got water don't you say you're greater than he is and their conversation kept going what was he doing contacting her spirit and when he found water trouble was he found her trouble and he said woman go get your husband and come here she said I don't have any husbands he said that's right you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband you told the truth now what did she say say are you a fortune teller is that a mental telepathy you're blzibub no sir she know more about God than half the preachers in the United States her being a prostitute she said sir I foresee that you are a prophet now if you run that reference it goes back to that prophet the one that Moses spoke of I perceive that you are a prophet we know we Samaritans Now watch how they were taught see we know when the Messiah cometh you'll tell us these things but who are you what was that to be the sign of the Messiah it was to the Jews and it was to the Samaritans the Gentiles were heathens they know nothing about any Messiah they worship an Idols Sun gods and everything that's our our class and said we know when the Messiah cometh that trees he had to declare it they'd heard of him we know when he comes he'll tell us these things but who are you he says I'm he that speaks to you and she ran into the City and said come be a man who told me the things that I've done isn't this the very Messiah if that's the way he made himself known to Israel who was looking for him also to the Samaritan who was looking for him to come what about the Gentiles today who's looking for him to come if he acted that way and he can't change in being God if that was a sign he showed him as to make himself the Messiah the true Jew believed it all the great Starkey he didn't believe it didn't even start with although he was holding a precise man he was a great man but theologians we haven't got him today like that they had to even come through a certain generation Levi or he could be a priest yes fathers fathers fathers fathers father father was free and he had to come down that lane holy without blemish that don't have one thing to do with it you might never tell a lie and if this is true go to church every night and be just as Reverend and pay your tithes and do everything and kneel the Alder and worship and go to hell like a Martin to its bounce that's what the scripture says that's what Cain done so where's our self-style religion getting us anyhow it's sending us away from God certainly is now notice did you the real truth you believed it as soon as they've seen that sign performed he said that's the Messiah you are the Son of God you're the king of Israel Jesus said because you believe when I told you you were under the tree before you come you believe you'll see greater things than this and the woman at the well said we know the Messiah will do those things because we're looking for that to happen but who are you are you a prophet he said I'm the Messiah she comes said to the man now you've taught me that the Messiah would do these things now there's the man out there that told me the things that I've done isn't this the Messiah now if he has to act the same now remember it never was done before a gentile we've had 2 000 years of half Dart and half-life joining church but he would be unjust amateur partiality if he didn't declare himself the Risen Christ after 2000 years is not because we got big churches that ain't the sign because we went across the nation Billy Graham Oral Roberts and all of us had great memberships coming into church that's not the sign that's no sign at all that's not what he did say watch your alcohol bigger crowd than John did that wasn't a sign but the sign of the Messiah was what I'm speaking of here that he did if he did that before that generation of Jews was cut off of them had breeds that was looking for him he's got to do the same thing before this Gentile generation or he did wrong when he acted back there in that way if he lets us go in with all our Theology and things like that and doesn't declare himself like he did to them before their destruction and this is the great sign to prove that the time is at hand that was at hand for the Jews and every Bible teacher knows that the the Gentiles dispensation is the end that he's the turn again to the Jews and God's heart and the Heart of Hitler mussolinia all those dictators in Russia and run those Jews right back in the Palestine where they're supposed to be standing there I got a picture three minutes before midnight according to science and those Jews coming in was packing their loved ones old crippled on their back you see in the look magazine live coming down from Iran in those places hacking those old Jews in the friend of mine went to him got it all in total chrome color said are you coming back to the Homeland to die to know we're coming back to see the Messiah we're not coming back today we're coming back to see the Messiah Jesus said when the Fig Tree goes to putting for this bud this generation 40 years shall not cease until all these Saints be fulfilled do you get it what's happening the last call for the Gentiles the nations are ready to be pulverized at any time and to think of it before that can happen the church goes on first and if we could be pulverized before Marty and the judgments how about the going home of the church he could come at any minute it's hurry oh wake up people shake your spiritual Soul Within You by reading the word we're at the end the time is at hand we've had theology we've had Church age but this is the time and now the life sign to the Jews was what the appearing of the Lord Jesus the life signed to the Gentile is him coming in the spirit of the Holy Ghost back into his church doing the same things that he did then you declare himself the same yesterday today and forever you look out you read the newspaper and see the writing in the sky you see we're bound to be doomed there's no other way out for him if God lets this nation get by with the sins of the doing he'll be obligated as a just God to raise up Simon and Gomorrah and apologize for burning him up they're doing the same things that we're doing God loves The Sinner but he hates sin and he's just and it's got to be judged and what he's doing his son is moving through the land today in the form of the Holy Ghost and the churches burn it getting away from it making fun of it so that he can be just to send a judgment what he promised he would do Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that same Lord Jesus that declared himself there promised prophesied said all these things that take place and here they are what are we going to do about it that's accepted friend let's believe it here's a little picture laying here someone asked me about that that light now forget about me I'm just a man see we're talking about the life it's a pillar of Fire George J lace to the head of the FBI fingerprinting document examiners hanging under Washington DC in the religious Hall of art the only supernatural being was ever photographed it's in Switzerland it's in Germany where they've taken it what else is scattered out why isn't this to be known it can't be no one they never know these things until it's done passed by he said I have hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and they revealed to they such as would learn how many knows Jesus said that thank God for it you Catholic people you never know who St Patrick was he wasn't a Catholic to begin with you know that but after he was dead a long time you recognized he was the same how about Saint Francis of assisia a walking preacher with a Bible under his arm you didn't recognize him then how about Joan of Arc the Catholic Church burner to his stake and her screening for Mercy you burn her as a witch of the algebug Spirit-filled woman saw visions and done signs and wonders and you better as a witch as it Beelzebub but about a hundred years later you realize she was a saint of course you've done repentance you dug up that priest's body and throwed it in the river now she's tannenized the Saints God always sends his Mercy his sign he goes over the top of the eyes otherwise it prudent reveals the baby calls the church and steals it there he goes he's just he said it obligated to his words look at many of those Jews down there in that day Matthew 12. he said many of them saw the things he done yet they could not believe only because the prophet said uh that they got eyes and can't see in ears and came here blinded the Gentiles are blinded by trees and and denominations hailed to see the mysterious resurrected Jesus moving in his Spirit among his church and doing the things that he's doing right here at the end time oh God open our eyes open our eyes with my prayer one more thing he did before we closed one day he was passing through he didn't see no vision he was passing through a little crowd of people and they were all packing him and shaking his hands and uh and so forth and a little woman stood within her heart I believe him to be a holy man I believe he's the son of God and I I'm just a little woman and she had a blood issue during the time of menopause is for many years she'd had it and they couldn't stop it the doctors could do nothing about it and she said if I can just touch His Garment I believe I'll be made whole and she touched His Garment now the Palestinian garment hangs loose you couldn't touch it the Border that's the bottom of it hanging way loose and she touched the border that garment she's setting probably below him and she touched the Border he walked a little bit he turned he said who's touched me that was Jesus yesterday the Bible said he's a high priest tonight that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities is that right the same yesterday today and forever the woman touched him he said who touched me and Peter being always felt big because he was kind of want to hear the apostles he said now rebuke the Lord Jesus and said why do you say such a thing as that who could tell who touched it everybody's touching you Jesus said but I got weed virtue's gone out of me that's the church I hope that you New Haven people touch I perceive that have gotten weak virtues gone from me everybody kept still you looked all around over a little group of people standing there around them fishermen around the river you looked out there and he saw the little woman he was in dude with power that could tell what was real Faith he said to the woman told her her conditions that thy faith has Daisy that was Jesus yesterday the Bible said he's the same yesterday and forever and a high priest Hebrews the New Testament that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities then if he is the high priest yes if you touched him if you said the audience where you are and say oh God let me touch you Jesus I believe you're not excited over just touching how would he act you'd have to act the same way he did then or he wouldn't be the same Jesus see he'd have to speak back use the lips of his church and say the same thing because we are Divine of the branches he's the vine you'd have to speak right back and say the same thing you did then or he isn't the same Jesus he isn't the same high priest he's another but he's alive tonight oh I'm so glad of that friend he's alive and in this day when we not don't have one then we can rest upon you you're we're just we're finished there's only one thing that can stand at the kingdom of God our nation gone she's eat to the core with termites I stood on the half on the places where pharaohs in Egypt had to dig 20 feet to find their palaces and enroll with the Caesar and all kingdoms give away because there's coming a kingdom that can never give away at the kingdom of God these others all Mortal gives away to immortality but the great nation that we have and yet the Bible says that every Nation Under the Sun is controlled by the devil Jesus said so all nations are controlled for the devil that's why we fight and carry on the way we do Satan said they're all mine he showed them I'll give them all to you if you worship me Jesus though he'd fall heir to him he said just be behind me Satan he knew he was there to them and as long as we are we got a marvelous president I'm not a politician but I like Mr Eisenhower and I think he's a wonderful man but if we put a Dwight Eisenhower in every County in this United States can still go up right on and sins the Bible said she was there you are the times here friend not long ago I took a trip up in Finland right after the first the second world war I've seen those Finnish women at night time all hooked up in the Hornets dragging a Hera behind them man little children packing linear and then it'll stop for night just keep on going the war was ended they had to paint the weed if they didn't get the wheat into be no crop next year that all starve to death little fellas running off the laners they'd be so tired and mother pulling and sweating shoulders rubbed and everything young girls and all dad coming behind throwing the wheat like that scratch it anyways just scratch the surface get the weed in the Snows is coming lays on all women no wheat No Lie brother that's the way it is today in the kingdom of God it's later than you think we can't have time to stop for Big Revival got to scratch the surface get the seat in brother Branham his message gets so much criticism today but did you hear anything in that sermon that wasn't about the Lord Jesus brother Branham had the same message that Paul had he said had the same message that Peter had it was lifting up a living Jesus Christ before us the musicians could come and when brother Branham was was preaching this and I I'm sure that they don't have the end of the tape but what happened every single time when he would preach a sermon like this is people he would start calling people out of the audience he was or if there was a prayer line they would come up and he would tell the people what was wrong with them one of those people was my grandfather his name is Carl wheeler he had a chronic stomach problem and he had heard that this man William Branham was going to be down in a place called Acton Kentucky he drove down there he got into the prayer line I believe he had a prayer card or anything like that they were coming around just like we were this morning they were coming around and he comes before brother Branham brother Branham tells him his name it's on tape brother Bram tells him his name he said you have a stomach problem called colitis he said brother your faith I believe he said something on the order of your faith has made you well go and be healed in the name of Jesus Christ my grandfather never from that day never suffered from stomach problems again fact he started following this man he saw something real in this man named William random that same night there was another lady that came through that same prayer line that lady came forth and he said you're here for someone else he said there is a lady an old lady that is sick and she's dying with cancer he said take that that handkerchief that you have in your hand and bring it up and lay it on that lady [Music] you know what happened this is a fairly famous story in the message so that lady went and she did it she was told she went up now this is down in the hills of Kentucky way back in the 1940s or 50s she goes and this lady was up on the hill and and she was she took that handkerchief and she laid it on this old lady who was dying with cancer and that little old lady was healed in the name of the Lord Jesus and there was another brother there and they had a group that went up with this old lady that this lady that took that handkerchief up there and when that woman that was dying of cancer was healed they started shouting and praising the Lord and it was heard down at the neighbor's house and there was another old man that was living down there and he heard all this this screaming and shouting and he said oh the old sister the old lady must have passed away he said I'll get my wagon in the morning and I'll go up there and I'll throw in this wagon we'll take her to the graveyard so that next morning that old man he gets he gets his wagon hooked up and he drives up to the top of the hill and he looks and there is that woman that was dying of cancer the day before she's there drinking a cup of coffee and eating breakfast oh so a while later the same man that we heard tonight he's down there squirrel hunting hunting with his buddy Banks wood and they go over and they they go to this they see this old man under this apple tree and they asked brother Banks goes up there and he asks the man can we hunt on your land the man the man said yeah he knew he knew brother Woods his dad so he said yeah he says you can go ahead and and Hunt there and and he says okay we'll be okay with my if my brought my pastor with me foreign looked at him and he said what he said have you got so low that you carry a preacher with you everywhere you go brother Branham walked over there he said well it's about my time I guess to go over there he goes over there and he talks to this old man and this old man says well he tells him he says I'm an infidel and brother Bram says well that's not something I'd be proud of and he says well he says I think your preachers are blocking up the wrong tree they talk for a little while and brother Brandon presents the word to him and he says you know he says the only thing he says that I would I would have a question about he said is um there was a man that came down here some time ago and he had meetings down here at this acting Campground the one that my grandpa was at [Music] he said that man there was a lady that came through prayer line the line and and he told her why she was there [Music] somehow he knew what she was thinking we just heard brother Branham talk about it tonight knowing the secrets of the heart somehow that man knew what that woman was thinking he said take that handkerchief that's on your hand in your hand and go up and lay it on that woman and she'd be healed said and she said I would like to ask that man what told him about that woman brother Branham just happened to be that very man my grandpa happened to be at those very meetings I was riding my uh riding my bike around Jeffersonville a few years ago and there was a there was a man sitting out in front of his house [Music] and I started talking with him and he said I said you ever hear of a man named William Branham around here in Jeffersonville he says yeah he says I went to his meetings I said I said really he says yeah I was there I said you're a Christian he said no he said no I never I never go to church anymore never went to church I said they took me to church when I was a boy I said so you but you went to William Brandon's meeting says oh yeah he said I was there and he said they had a prayer line and the people came through and he said there was this man that had a crippled arm and he said he said I uh watch that man and he said he came before Branham and he said he prayed did what he did and he said that man's arm straightened out he says it would it was in a sling and he took the sling off and he started wiggling spreading his arm around like that [Applause] I said you're kidding me he said no I said so that man had a crippled arm when he came up and he left without a crippled arm I said are you telling me you saw that he goes listen man he says I was there you don't have he says you don't have to believe me he said but I was there and I saw it I said brother I said let me tell you I said I'm in his ministry today and he said well he said he said I saw it happen I asked him why aren't you a Christian today he says you know he says I should be he says whatever that man had was real let's all stand [Music] God sent that man William Branham to show us to show us that the power of God is alive today amen and he did and let me tell you none of us I don't believe I don't know I know if anyone was there in his meetings brother Kenny were you there you're a little young brother Arnie was there but let me tell you my family on both sides was in many of them and they saw many many many miracles they saw the power of God come down and let me tell you brother branham's message would be different if God didn't do those miracles but he did those Miracles and he proved I God am with that man and his critics let me see you do what he did and then maybe I'll give you some of my time otherwise I got no time [Music] friends I believe that the Lord wants us to spend more time in prayer I really have been thinking about that all day and um thinking about it a few days before I knew that we were going to pray for sister Connie and I did my best to prepare praying for her and I prayed more than I usually praise I fasted prayed and I'll tell you what I'm a better man today just spending a couple more in a just a couple days spending that more time in prayer I believe that the Lord has made me a better person and I would encourage you to God bless you brother Jonathan if you can lead us on the wings all the small [Music] ER small light up the consensus pure Sweet Love is [Music] one more friends I'm sorry I know you've heard the testimony but I just gotta tell it again this song 1961. I believe is when this song came out by a man named Ferlin Husky brand new song and this is where I might differ with some of the died in the wool message people that say that we can't sing any of these modern songs that was a modern song by a man that didn't maybe live such a good life but he was inspired to write that song that song was on the radio brother Branham asked my grandpa Evans and my dad both of them were there he said you know that song on the wings of a snow white dove by Ferlin Husky have you heard it they said yeah he said I got a message I want to preach and he says I'm going to call it on the wings of a snow white dove and he said when you hear me preach that message you know it is my time to go brother Brandon preached that message less than one month before he was before he died in a car accident profit speaking prophetically in my family is a witness one more verse my friend [Music] um I was waiting today for the Savior to God [Music] foreign [Music] sweet love is a sign from all the wings of a dove brothers and sisters brother branham's message we've we've believed that we've messed it up over all these years brother branham's message and you heard him talk about it tonight it was to come out of those denominations because you think that you're saved because you're a Methodist you think that you're saved because you're a Baptist you think that you're saved because you go to this church or that church it has nothing to do it with it you have to know Jesus Christ you have to have that relationship with him only then will you be saved and he that man stood against the denominational the denominational system of that day and it is still here today let me read to you something that you just heard it says this it says now he Jesus said I am the vine and you are the branches now if the vine doesn't bear the the fruit of itself it only purges the branches and the branches bear the fruit so that vine that stump brings the water and nutrients up into the branches and then it goes out into the branches and bears fruit from those branches do you know that brother Brahm said well then if you went to a grapevine what would you expect to find grapes if you went to a watermelon vine you'd find watermelon if it's a fertile Vine and if you went to a peach street find peaches but then if Christ is the vine Hallelujah and his members of the church is the branches what ought you to find in the church The Works that I do Jesus speaking right here the works that I do shall you do also More Than This shall you do for I go unto my father what do you find in contrary to what he just said what do you find when you go to church we are Presbyterian We Are Baptist we are Pentecostals we got the message [Music] we got this that's not Christ is love because he was God so how can we say that we are we are something more special in this day when brother Branham right there put us right in with the with the Baptist and the Presbyterian right in with the denominations we are nothing without Jesus Christ we are nothing without him he is everything he is the one that heals the sick he is the one that cleanses the lepers as the Bible says he is the one that gave the prophet the discernment to know what was on these people's hearts he is the one that is here today that answers our prayers it is Jesus Christ and we are wrong in creating a denomination around it listen to what the prophet said you won't go wrong with what that man said that man William Branham God bless you all on their wings [Music] is [Music] God sends his pure Sweet Love aside from above all the wings of us [Music] I'd like to read a testimony [Music] just Amelia writes this on Wednesday my daughter and I we're coming to church and a neighbor stopped us and asked asked if we had heard about the fire [Music] she said I said no and she said that there had been a fire on our floor in the stairwell and I slept through it thank you Lord for protecting us [Music] [Applause] there's a common denominator here and she writes sister Amelia writes another one coming home from church [Music] God bless you hard sister Amelia going to church and coming home from church a lot of the roads were blocked by police cars I was able to get into my building by the back and we learned that there was an active shooter in the apartment across the street from us thank you Lord once again Mr Amelia [Applause] let me just bow our heads or Jesus cause us Lord to check our hearts to listen to what's been said oh Lord we know so many times we we have different ways of hearing things but let's hear it the way you want us to hear it let us hear the Revelation that you have for us personally Lord we know this is a message to each and everyone so father let's take this and oh Lord there's nothing been said here that's going to hurt us it's going to help us amen and oh God you know your word says praying always father you know I was thinking that sometimes they would say that how do you pray always how do you always be thinking about you Lord but we know that Satan constantly is pressuring our people he never lets up he never sleeps so Lord Jesus let us counter that with calling upon you staying in your spirit we know brother Branham said is that we are pressure honest with the Holy Spirit no evil can get in so father pressurizes Lord will cause us oh God to take this has been said and Lord let us cause us to pray more whatever it takes father we know that's the answer for the personal relationship Lord the building block of your of our relationship is our prayer with you Lord and as we're in relationship with you and we come and meet with each other Lord we know that it's all good father you are good Lord these are your children so we pray Lord that each and one would take the words that we've heard today and take them to heart and Ponder them in our hearts oh Lord consider them and then Lord find time to go before you in prayer Lord and not just asking for something but Lord in my heart I believe sometimes father you just want Fellowship amen you just want us to just be appreciative of you and Lord you know our hearts we know that when you're in your presence oh God you'll take care of us and Lord let us let us learn to love to be in your presence Let It Be an addiction that we can't do without it forgive me Lord or for I am slack I'll confess this before my brothers and sisters help me to pray more forgive me oh God for not being more diligent but I thank you Lord for this time that we've had to remind us one more time oh God one more time we thank you for this warning we thank you for this blessing we ask now that you go with each and every one to their homes and Lord they would take this to heart and not forget what's been said but act upon it the precious name of the Lord Jesus amen amen [Laughter] [Music] all the wings God bless you brothers and sisters I feel that we found the mind of the Lord believe he wanted us to hear that tonight and I thank God that he is so good and Lord forgive me for all of my mistakes and every time I've missed his mind and the in the time I should have spent in prayer I didn't do it Lord forgive me and I want to do a better job amen do you want to do a better job too God bless you all you're dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] brothers and sisters just one second
