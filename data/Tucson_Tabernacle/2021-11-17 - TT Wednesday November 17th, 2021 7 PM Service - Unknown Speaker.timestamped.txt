[42:26] will be bad today
[42:28] so she mows these down the street and as
[42:30] she begins to walk and say well i'll
[42:32] just have to wait till that's over
[42:34] and she made her living in a bad way
[42:37] so she was walking down the street after
[42:39] a while her little
[42:41] hungry stomach
[42:42] smell that roasted lamb
[42:46] my heart smells good never had anything
[42:48] like that to eat my life
[42:50] maybe been turned out on the street
[42:52] by some parents
[42:54] you know a lot of times we think about
[42:56] juvenile delinquency i think a whole lot
[42:58] of it is parent delinquency
[43:02] the kids have been taught to pray and
[43:05] serve god instead of
[43:07] mama out somewhere at a card party and
[43:09] her religious card party and
[43:14] dad out of the
[43:15] golf course somewhere and
[43:19] sister out with
[43:20] junior out there on the street
[43:22] running around
[43:24] maybe things have been different had the
[43:26] old-fashioned prayer altar
[43:28] the bible instead of a deck of cards and
[43:31] throwed that television out the door a
[43:33] long time ago
[43:34] and
[43:35] it might have been a whole lot different
[43:36] you all used to be wrong go to pictures
[43:38] show the devil put it right over on her
[43:39] she brought it right in her house
[43:45] she's hungry she smelled man
[43:48] she said my smells good
[43:50] i wonder really how a piece of roasted
[43:52] lamb would really taste in a human's
[43:54] mouth
[43:56] i don't know how it would be i believe
[43:57] i'll just walk up now she couldn't get
[43:58] too close to him because she was a woman
[44:01] they were self-righteous you see they
[44:02] all belong to church
[44:04] so they
[44:06] couldn't get around where is that
[44:09] she was considered a sinner
[44:11] so if she
[44:12] walked up close and if you didn't look
[44:14] around seen all of them standing there
[44:16] in the water running out of their mouth
[44:17] is a gasp you know looking at this ram
[44:21] or lamb in there roasting and all the
[44:23] fine foods and things being packed
[44:25] around in there what a great time and
[44:27] she began to look through the crowd like
[44:30] that
[44:31] and her eyes fell upon me
[44:34] who's that
[44:36] he's got dirty feet
[44:38] i wonder who that what if somebody would
[44:40] tell me say well you
[44:42] turns away real quick won't nothing do
[44:44] with her she's a sinner
[44:47] so ask somebody else finally maybe a
[44:49] little lady that
[44:50] was believing and looking the same way
[44:53] said uh
[44:54] madam would pardon me but would you who
[44:57] is that sitting there how did that
[44:58] person well he said you know who that is
[45:00] did you hear him talk about that jesus
[45:02] of nazareth is supposed to be a prophet
[45:04] oh yes
[45:06] is that him
[45:07] that's him
[45:08] well he isn't washed i understood that
[45:11] everybody's forced to be washed before
[45:13] they come in there and anointed look at
[45:15] him well it's not right
[45:18] she had an opportunity presented to her
[45:20] she remembered a story that someone told
[45:22] her another woman of her trade
[45:25] one time up in in the samaria the city
[45:28] of psycho had been forgiven of every sin
[45:32] and she realized that that might be an
[45:34] opportunity for her
[45:36] so how is she going to get to him now
[45:38] she seen he was needy and she wanted to
[45:42] serve him
[45:43] and couldn't get to him
[45:45] that's about the way it is
[45:48] so she thought what can i do he has no
[45:51] anointing his feet's dirty nobody's
[45:53] paying attention oh if i could only get
[45:56] in there
[45:57] that's the real pin at heart if i can
[46:00] only get to it
[46:02] now she think get her mind catches
[46:03] something you know what i believe i'll
[46:04] do i know down the street she goes just
[46:07] as quick as she can down through the
[46:08] alley up this little creaky steps and
[46:10] opens the door goes in there and gets a
[46:13] stocking top you know and pulls it out
[46:16] counts how much money she's got she said
[46:18] hi is that enough to buy some anointing
[46:20] oil let's see if it is there's 20 pieces
[46:22] of roman denarii perhaps that's enough
[46:25] but wait i can't do that he's a prophet
[46:28] and he'll know where i got that money
[46:30] he'll know how i got it i just can't do
[46:33] it so she perhaps laid it back again and
[46:35] once she laid it back it was something
[46:37] kept speaking to her heart
[46:39] but would you let him sit there dirty
[46:41] like that
[46:42] would you let the only man that can take
[46:45] away your sins set dirty when you can
[46:48] give him service
[46:50] so she says to herself whether he knows
[46:52] or not i'm going down the street she
[46:54] went and run into a store where these
[46:57] little hook those fellas sitting in
[46:59] there well what do you want to hear she
[47:00] said i want the best alabaster ointment
[47:04] that you got
[47:06] not the cheapest i want the best
[47:09] she had a special reason
[47:12] and that's what we ought to do
[47:13] we are to give him our best
[47:16] everything we are our youthful life not
[47:18] wait till we're old and dying
[47:20] give the best we got to him
[47:22] and there she got the very best he went
[47:25] up said let's see how much money that is
[47:27] and he got the money first he knew her
[47:29] also so i said yes she had the money so
[47:31] where you going with this i have it for
[47:33] a special occasion so she goes up now
[47:37] she has no invitation
[47:39] but how's she going to get in but
[47:41] somehow if you want to do a service for
[47:43] jesus he'll make a way for you get in
[47:46] somehow another she got in
[47:48] and there was jesus sitting there yet
[47:50] and she had to think which got in there
[47:52] heart beating real fast oh my what if
[47:54] he'd happen to turn me down
[47:56] there's a lot of things to think about
[47:58] what if he'd come up here and say say
[48:00] you foul woman what are you doing here
[48:02] in my presence know you not that i'm a
[48:04] son of god you shouldn't be here in my
[48:06] presence
[48:08] her heart almost failed and she thought
[48:10] what can i do but i've got to get to him
[48:12] i can't pass this time this may be the
[48:15] last opportunity i'll have
[48:18] it might be yours too
[48:23] look down
[48:24] and her heart begin to swell up
[48:27] she she knows she's in his presence
[48:30] there's something happens when you get
[48:31] in his presence
[48:33] she noticed the tears began to fall off
[48:34] of her cheeks and she was sitting there
[48:36] shaking this box in her hand
[48:38] and she fell down at his feet
[48:40] and she thought i can't look up i'm so
[48:43] guilty and dirty i can't look up so she
[48:46] started crying they began to fall upon
[48:47] his feet and she began to wash him like
[48:49] that with her hands white and trying to
[48:51] wipe the tears off of his feet and
[48:53] washing his feet with her tears
[48:55] and after a while she didn't have no
[48:57] towel
[48:58] to wipe his feet with so her hair was
[49:01] hanging down and she began to wipe his
[49:03] feet with the hair that was on her head
[49:06] more than our sisters have a time doing
[49:08] that they'd have to stand on their head
[49:09] to do it
[49:13] our sisters today what if you one of the
[49:17] women realize that god keeps all his
[49:19] promise i wonder if you realize that
[49:21] it's totally impossible
[49:24] for you to get in like that
[49:27] he keeps all of his promises
[49:29] do you realize what you're doing when
[49:31] you're doing that
[49:32] you're denying virtue
[49:37] the bible said that if a woman kebabs
[49:39] her hair is even a common thing for her
[49:41] even prey
[49:42] and she dishonors her husband in doing
[49:44] so and remember it was a woman that
[49:46] broke one commandment of god that caused
[49:49] all this to do that do you think one
[49:50] breaking one will get back in
[49:54] think of it
[49:56] maybe sometimes
[49:58] ministers hasn't gotten nerve enough to
[50:00] tell you
[50:01] this is one time you're going to hear it
[50:04] it's the truth
[50:06] someone said why don't you leave off
[50:07] that women a great man told me that not
[50:10] long ago said well they believe you're a
[50:11] prophet you teach them how to receive
[50:13] the holy ghost and get these great big
[50:14] things and how to to be prophets and so
[50:16] forth i said i teach them greater things
[50:19] i said how can i teach them algebra when
[50:21] they won't even learn their abcs
[50:24] it shows the outside expresses what's on
[50:27] the inside
[50:30] but you go on to it anyhow why
[50:33] you're not conscious
[50:35] of it
[50:36] amen there she was with her hair she
[50:39] began to wipe his feet with it rhymes
[50:41] feed on she was scared to death that's
[50:43] why she picked up this bottom ointment
[50:45] she broke it and she tried to hit it and
[50:47] break it and put it on his feet and she
[50:48] was crying and every time she'd cry she
[50:50] reached out and kissed his feet she got
[50:52] hysterically
[50:54] when you get this presence it makes you
[50:56] hysterically
[50:58] i got hysterically
[51:00] any man ever gets in his presence that's
[51:02] weaves him and has faith in him it'll
[51:04] make you hysterically on the day of
[51:06] pentecost when you come in the form of
[51:08] the holy ghost
[51:10] thank god hysterically
[51:13] when you really believe and you know and
[51:15] recognize it's your opportunity and
[51:17] you're in his presence
[51:19] you're sure of it she'd
[51:23] kiss his feet and cry
[51:25] and wash him white and
[51:27] kiss his feet again you know jesus if he
[51:30] had moved one foot
[51:32] she'd have jumped up and run out there
[51:33] you know he just said let her do it
[51:36] you know if you want to do something for
[51:38] him he lets you do it
[51:40] it may be all out of order but he lets
[51:42] you in
[51:44] and he was doing him a service and she
[51:46] was washing his feet and he just sat
[51:47] there and looked at her she was free to
[51:49] look up because freddie would make her
[51:51] scat and see she was washing his feet
[51:53] his opportunity to do something foreign
[51:56] and she was just i see
[51:59] when he when jesus spoke back to the
[52:01] pharisee he justified her by her works
[52:04] but when he justified her to herself he
[52:06] justified by her faith thy faith is
[52:08] saved he showed pharisee what her works
[52:11] was because your works expresses your
[52:13] faith
[52:14] now let your hair grow out
[52:17] now see it expresses what you believe or
[52:19] not that's god's word there's no
[52:21] scripture in the bible but what that's
[52:22] the truth
[52:23] why do you do it
[52:26] now
[52:27] notice too much hollywood in pentecost
[52:29] that's what's the matter amen
[52:31] now we find out that's the truth it's
[52:32] just too much hollywood you watch these
[52:35] things and pattern yourself a lady said
[52:37] to me not long ago she said little tight
[52:39] dress on i said why don't you take that
[52:40] off of being a sister
[52:42] and she said well brother grandma don't
[52:44] make any other clothes i said they make
[52:45] sewing machines and they got goods i
[52:47] think you just want to
[52:49] i'll tell you why let me tell you sister
[52:54] thank you
[52:55] one of these days you're going to have
[52:56] to answer for committing adultery
[52:59] you say well brother brown i miss this
[53:01] pure to my husband as i can be i miss
[53:02] pure to my boyfriend that might be so
[53:04] too but jesus said whosoever looketh
[53:07] upon a woman to lust after her half
[53:10] committed adultery with her already in
[53:12] his heart
[53:13] and if you've presented yourself out
[53:15] there and that sinner thinks that about
[53:16] you because you presented yourself that
[53:18] the day of the judgment when he answers
[53:20] for committing adultery who's guilty
[53:24] think of it
[53:26] that's exactly right oh women come home

[53:34] your wife do that

[53:59] his his big chin swelled out his face
[54:01] looked like would burst oh my
[54:04] he said come here
[54:06] look here look over there and he said
[54:08] within his own heart now
[54:10] in his his mind
[54:12] he said if that man was a prophet
[54:16] he would know what manner of woman that
[54:18] is touched him
[54:20] see if he is a prophet or not
[54:23] see he perceived the thoughts that was

[57:54] don't care what the rest of him says i'm
[57:56] ready to stand in his denomination and
[57:58] declare that he is the word of god i
[58:01] don't care what they say let people turn
[58:03] on if you want to send a mind reader
[58:05] fortune teller whatever you want to i'm
[58:08] ready to kiss the reproach from him

[58:15] he promised that he is the word just as
[58:17] much today as he was then
[58:19] you said so
[58:21] now friend
[58:23] there may be people sitting here that
[58:24] can't agree that he's the prophet
[58:27] you might not agree that he's a healer
[58:30] but there's one thing that every church
[58:32] member should agree he's a
[58:34] savior and i want to say this before
[58:37] closing
[58:38] not long ago a attorney friend of mine
[58:41] was trying a case of a man and woman
[58:43] that it was going to
[58:45] separate the attorney was a fine
[58:47] christian gentleman he said don't don't
[58:49] separate he tried his best to keep him
[58:51] from it but not this determined there
[58:52] was going to be something come up
[58:53] between them
[58:55] after a while
[58:56] he said well if you got the home down
[58:58] there you better go down and divide the
[58:59] spoils because if they have to get them
[59:01] down and lawyers and things get into it
[59:03] you know what's going to happen
[59:05] they'll take every bit of it
[59:06] so they went into the rooms to divide up
[59:08] what they had they went into the parlor
[59:10] they fussed and stood obliged this and i
[59:12] had this and they went on in the next
[59:14] room and divided in there and finally
[59:16] went up in the attic they had a remember
[59:18] they had an old trunk up there they got
[59:20] in there and began to say well this
[59:21] belonged to my mama this was my mama's
[59:24] like that they got down in the trunk a
[59:26] piece both of them kneeling on the floor
[59:28] with the trunk right open dividing up
[59:30] what was what they couldn't agree that
[59:32] belongs to me i paid for that i've done
[59:35] the work i stayed home when you did it
[59:37] fussing
[59:39] finally they raised up something else
[59:41] and both of them grabbed the same time
[59:43] what was it
[59:45] a little pair of shoes
[59:47] from a little baby that had been born to
[59:49] that union that god had taken
[59:53] they couldn't argue
[59:55] they had something in common
[59:58] as they held her hands he remembered
[1:00:01] that she was a mother that baby
[1:00:04] he remembered she was a mother
[1:00:06] she remembered he was a father as they
[1:00:08] helped the little shoes in their hands
[1:00:11] they pulled one another to each other
[1:00:12] put their arms around each other
[1:00:15] the divorce case was involved
[1:00:17] wow
[1:00:18] they found something they had in common
[1:00:22] you might have disagreed with me this
[1:00:23] week to see the holy spirit come in
[1:00:25] confirm these words and things do you
[1:00:27] might disagree with that you might
[1:00:28] disagree with the sick being healed but
[1:00:30] we do have one thing in common that's
[1:00:32] the blood of jesus christ that saves us
[1:00:34] from sins
[1:00:35] will you wash the dirt from his feet
[1:00:37] tonight let us bow our heads just a
[1:00:39] moment
[1:00:40] remember
[1:00:41] he keeps
[1:00:42] every promise
[1:00:44] he keeps every promise he promised
[1:00:46] though your sins be a scarlet they shall
[1:00:48] be wise know all your sins are forgiven
[1:00:51] you if you'll just believe it with our
[1:00:54] heads bound i wonder how many here will
[1:00:56] raise your hand and say brother branham
[1:00:58] i want to

[1:05:32] church and i asked her that night to
[1:05:33] come to christ and she wouldn't do it
[1:05:35] and then afterwards she met me outside
[1:05:37] and said don't you never embarrass me
[1:05:39] like that again a year later i pass
[1:05:41] through the streets she's an honorable
[1:05:43] young girl i pass through the street or
[1:05:45] underneath skirts hanging down smoking a
[1:05:47] cigarette going down the street she's a
[1:05:48] deacon's daughter

[1:06:14] bottle i'll tell you i said aren't you
[1:06:15] ashamed of yourself to offer me a drink
[1:06:18] out of a bottle or a cigarette
[1:06:20] she said i want to tell you something
[1:06:21] preacher you know that night she told me
[1:06:24] that was my last chance i said yes i
[1:06:26] remember she said you were right
[1:06:28] she said since then my soul's been so
[1:06:31] hard she said now here's the remark it
[1:06:33] just runs shivers over my back she said
[1:06:36] i could see my own mother soul frying
[1:06:38] hell like a pancake in life

[1:07:59] guess maybe it's later and i really
[1:08:01] think

[1:11:41] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:11:44] the remission of sin and you shall
[1:11:45] receive the gift of the holy ghost for
[1:11:47] the promises unto you and to your
[1:11:49] children and to them as far off even as
[1:11:51] many as the lord our god shall call and

[1:34:02] that last half an hour
[1:34:04] of that
[1:34:06] sermon
[1:34:07] where god in his great mercy is reaching
[1:34:10] out
[1:34:12] and saying come back to me
[1:34:15] and i sat there in the room listening to
[1:34:17] that and they said lord
[1:34:19] let each one of us
[1:34:22] always
[1:34:25] never be ashamed never say lord
[1:34:28] i don't have time now
[1:34:31] but just
[1:34:32] even brother brandon reconsecrating his
[1:34:34] life right there
[1:34:36] and he said god is calling god is
[1:34:38] pulling
[1:34:39] just made me stop and think lord what
[1:34:41] about my life you know
[1:34:43] where's that fervency or where's that
[1:34:44] joy that i once had where's that
[1:34:48] forgive me and try me one more time
[1:34:51] even as david said and
[1:34:54] you know i said well that was for
[1:34:55] sinners without the grace of god where
[1:34:57] are we all you know it's come by god's
[1:35:00] mercy and his grace so
[1:35:02] amen
[1:35:04] i just
[1:35:05] some people would say maybe just you
[1:35:07] know skip that part but no god speaks
[1:35:10] reaches out and just says lord let me
[1:35:12] examine myself closely and say
[1:35:15] you know and
[1:35:16] it'd be like danny martin there and you
[1:35:18] begin to realize in his presence wow i'm
[1:35:20] short here
[1:35:22] boy i failed here
[1:35:24] i lost my temper at someone the other
[1:35:26] day i
[1:35:29] but i'm i'm grateful for his blood i'm
[1:35:31] grateful for his mercy but he asks us he
[1:35:34] tells us confess and say lord help me
[1:35:38] create in me a clean heart oh god

[1:45:37] when you stop for a moment
[1:45:39] when i had that song stuck in my head i
[1:45:41] couldn't get out and i said lord can you
[1:45:43] do something about this
[1:45:45] in that song think about his love
[1:45:47] i've had to do that more than once
[1:45:49] recently something comes and i just say
[1:45:52] stop start singing that song
[1:45:55] and the the atmosphere changes
[1:45:57] immediately you can't be singing a song
[1:45:59] like that and thinking evil about
[1:46:00] something or wrong about something or be
[1:46:02] upset about so you say
[1:46:04] why
[1:46:05] it works it's the grace and the mercy of
[1:46:07] god god bless you as you go tonight
