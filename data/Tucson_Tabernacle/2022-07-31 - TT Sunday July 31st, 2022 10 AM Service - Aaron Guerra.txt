thee if you would play that softly brother ronnie glide well if you would just come this morning take these needs in prayer to the lord on our behalf and speak on behalf of the congregation this morning just bear with me some of these came in a little bit later sister rachel guetta said please pray for ellie hauser an old family friend of our family the doctor has found cancer cells in her stomach the family asks for prayer also pray for salvation thank you sister sylvia figaro requesting prayer for my sister irma she is having problems walking thank you amen we also have one praised by sister emilia gonzalez just thank you for your prayers i'm feeling a lot better amen god's a healing god amen amen i'm sure each one of us has a need this morning maybe we didn't ride it in but god

word and healed my disease you are the lord my healer [Music] [Music] as we get ready to pray let's just remember god hears and answers our prayers it's so important that we believe this you know so many times when i've said a little prayer and there's no lightning there's no inspiration nothing later on something happened and i go wow [Music] and something inside says didn't you pray for that so it doesn't have to be any just great inspiration just believe god's word he'll keep my wife and i had went to the refuge station to dump some cactus off and the guy across from me and dumped a big load of cactus and the wind blew loose sand and cactus in my eyes and even last night i got up there all the night my right eye was just inflamed and i said lord that can you heal my eye it's really i don't want to miss church this morning it's really irritating me and i washed it out a little bit went back to bed and got up this morning it was still hurting and took a shower it's gone it's that simple heavenly father we come before you through your word you know god we know because you are we are without you we're nothing but oh god you have we have been chosen by you we know we have because your spirit draws us and for this we're forever grateful and oh lord it would just be a sin not to believe your word this morning that when we ask for these prayers for these wonderful and lovely people have asked us i pray lord you are forgiving my sins i want to be as sincere as possible that i would not hinder the healing and the and the prayer that those that have put confidence in this church and these people that have asked and for those hands that have went up lord we know that each and every one of us we're living our lives i do not see each and every individual and what they're going through but i know every life oh god is is going through something satan does not leave a one of us out of his eyesight but oh god you have promised that you would keep us so lord we come before you this morning once again for these prayer requests that you would meet them lord jesus and that they would be faithful and give you the thanks but when you meet their need lord that they would make it known that you've touched them but oh god this the we are enjoying lord that this morning of fellowship and the songs our brother is chosen to sing and our hearts are glad to be here this morning father we're so thankful oh god let us never be grumbling or complaining or numbering we have so much to be thankful for where your word says that you are in the praises you are in that midst the praises of your people so lord may we just be thankful and praise you knowing you will keep our word and you will meet with us and once again lord just remember that ones that could not be here and those are brothers and sisters around the world father they're from every kindred nation and country you have chosen a bride and this morning father we pray for them also our hearts go out to those that are are not have the the privilege that we have here in this united states and this even in this assembly so be with those we pray in the precious name of the lord jesus amen [Music] it's your prayer to turn the surface over to brother aaron change the word of service let's just sing the song he has forgiven me [Music] oh he has forgiven me my sins have been washed from his memory by the blood of the lamb of calvary he has forgiven me he has forgiven me my sins have been washed from his memories of calvary he has forgiven me he has forgiven me my sins have been washed from his memory by the blood of the land of calvary he has forgiven me that sounds real nice just the congregation oh he [Music] has forgiven me my sins have been washed from his memory by the blood of the lamb of calvary he has forgiven me oh he has forgiven me [Music] amazing grace [Music] that first verse amazing grace is this one amazing grace how sweet the [Music] [Applause] like me [Applause] i was was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i let's praise him just once oh praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] lord that grace which we know is unmerited favor but you chose to do it that way lord and we appreciate it if we would compare our life to yours lord we'd have no chance but you took our place you you wrapped yourself in a in a body of flesh and you walked on earth for 33 years you were tempted you were tried you you had to deal with the thoughts and and the feelings and everything that that goes through our body lord through our mind so that you could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities today lord and you said i'll stand in their place you had to make that decision lord as you there in gethsemane and you said father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me and then you said not my will but thy will be done lord and because of that we're here today lord we have this opportunity to serve you to love you to fellowship with you to walk with you to be called mrs jesus christ today lord we just want to say thank you lord we appreciate that now we just ask you to continue the lord in the blessing and being with us in the rest of this service in jesus christ's name amen thank you you may be seated thank you just a couple of announcements and things a couple of things too go over and good to be back in the house of the lord this morning we had the opportunity to go up to flagstaff for kind of a long weekend and it was a blessing up there it was a good time and all the rain fell on the east side of flagstaff we were on the west side so the there was no trouble getting around we did take a ride out to that side and it was where there was a lot of storm damage and all but um the saints of god were still in church anyway so it was a wonderful fellowship we had reserved a hotel through the flagstaff they had set some rooms available and at a really good price and brother steve robson called us called me on thursday and he said how many of you are coming up i suggest me and my wife and he said well we we would like to use your room for a family that needs another bed and if you don't mind we're going to put you up in a little airbnb that'll be all right a brother has a little place here he said that would be okay i said whatever works that's fine so we went over there and probably the nicest place we'd ever stayed before no other atmosphere except it was a brother's place very nice very good spirit and then the brothers told brother steve tell them brother that there's no charge and i didn't arrange that but he took care of it so in our appreciation for that and and all um my wife said we're going to clean this really well so we did and the brother sent a note back through brother steve he said tell the brother specifically tell the brother that that was the cleanest we've ever seen our place after somebody's left and i said send texts back to brother stephen i said tell the brother it was the sister more than the brother but yeah she said now you're going to do this and you're and it was so nice we had a wonderful time good fellowship up there brother darrell ward spoke on friday evening and brother aaron mcgary saturday late afternoon and brother ferguson on sunday and brother daryl saw me and he come up with aaron how's the tabernacle going so we shared some things and he says you call me anytime and i'll come i said well thank you lord i didn't even have to ask so lord willing and i told some of the brothers we'll be nice to you we'll wait till maybe october it's pretty warm down there but they said you just called us whenever we'd come down and help brother aaron mcgarry the same way we had a good time of fellowship so appreciate that and then of course when you get back and got to do all the catch up on the work so wednesday turned out to be about a 13-hour day just to try to get caught up but there's work there are those that are struggling the lord's been good to us so and then one other thing just um to bring to your attention uh the wedding brother enoch peterson getting married the first third weekend of september and there's quite a few folks are planning on going lord william we're going to go and when we kind of looked it over a lot of people will be gone all the musicians the song leaders overall so we're we're looking at what we're going to do that week and there's a possibility of canceling the service if there's not the staff to do that but just kind of a heads up coming up about a little over a month from there and myself and my wife we always had been taking a week off in october when she was have her week off from school and we would celebrate our anniversary and anything else and take a week off but because she's not working anymore we can take that time and um and lord willing we'll go and then take some more time and maybe see that part of the country that we haven't seen since i was a little boy and don't remember any of it but so just kind of a heads up on that coming up in a while but lord has been good to us brother ferguson gave some testimonies on sunday there are people still giving their lives for this gospel and when sometimes we think we have it hard and you hear the testimonies it's just not the same he spoke of a brother the crossing from kinshasa to brazzaville there crossing the river and and he could not get a ride across because it's it's there was a war going on and they finally were able to get the brother across and when he got to across into brazil and had to go to where he was going nobody would take him on a taxi because there's a war going on so they've one of the taxi drivers says i'll take you and they got to the just where they were about to be there and he says now stop and listen he said you could just hear the firing going across the road that they were to travel across he said but he got me over there but he said this is why nobody will bring because there is a war going on on this and he said not only that but there was a brother from kinshasa that crossed over and they asked for his id and when they he showed his id they didn't accept him though they put him up on the tree and shot him and killed him right there we don't have much to complain about but our brothers and sisters so we keep them in prayer you know there is satan has will never give up he doesn't know that he knows what his end is going to be and he'll never give up but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so it was it was a good good weekend wonderful time got to meet a family that we had never met before and it's we would look at as a by chance we went to have the breakfast that they do on saturday morning and there was one table left there with one sister sitting on it my wife had gone on ahead and she went and sat next to the sister and they got to talking so i went and sat next to her and then her husband came had never met them well they know the petersons both jordan and martha they were back in florida with them they also attended a time with brother watkins church they knew the shorts that came from here brother newton bennett they were there and here we've never met each other and he began to ask some questions because he said what's going on in tucson we don't hear nothing about it so for about an hour of fellowship we got to share what god is doing and his words were praise god we've wondered about these things he said what happened after brother greene passed away what happened after this but thank god he said that there's still a people that believe so sometimes you think it's perchance brother ronnie you might have said why did this happen to me but that was so you could give a testimony this morning to remind us that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and would you be willing to say lord use me as an example use me for a reason let somebody else see god in my life you know and then so i praise god that it we had we had a good time we enjoyed ourselves we got to meet some new folks brother aaron mcgary and the message that he spoke on on saturday i would love for us to hear that as a church and we talked about and there's a possibility of them coming down and ministering it's about being in battle being in a war and you have to battle you have to war but what will your attitude be how will you let it affect you and and the the place he brought is do you let it get you hard and and not being able to touched and feel anymore because you're so tired and wounded and it reminded me and he brought it up of those with amnesia after the war and he says you take them back to where they used to be where they were and the memory becomes the familiar parts and and sometimes you just have to go back to this and begin to open it up and read it and something just begins to speak back to you as as i was preparing with some notes and some things and i had some thoughts in my heart my mind and i was trying to find something i know brother branham said and sometimes when you're searching you don't put to put it the right way and it won't come up and i couldn't find it so this morning as i was preparing and getting i turned on the message what house will you build me it's about 34 minutes long i said i've got enough time to listen to that well what we're preparing for church and within about five minutes brother branham says that which i was looking for and i realized lord you're mindful i searched for it yesterday for a while i just couldn't find it but i knew he had said it and so then i opened up scripture of the day you have scripture of the day on your on your phone you have scripture today on your computer and david says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my strength and my redeemer and so just i just appreciate that god being so mindful of us that way and i listened to brother daniel heaven's service sunday morning and i really appreciated that i was that was good and i talked with him yesterday and he was going to be up in phoenix today ministering and so lord bless them where they're at today i didn't hear yours yet brother lyle but we will how many appreciate god's grace and god's mercy amen you know and and you you read different things you hear different things all day we this past week with steven and myself my boss and dan the other the other guy that works with a subcontractor was worked with brother jerry mcfadden for years has always speaks well of your dad just just he said it was i still remember them asking me at work do you have any more jerry mcfadden's at your church that we could use the ability to do the work and the attitude and the atmosphere that they create walk in brother jerry working away singing at the top of head is his voice nothing between my soul and my savior you know you walk into somebody else and their radio station is blasting and this is going on but to walk into where a believer's working and there's a good atmosphere so it was a hard week all the things that we had to get caught up on and because of all that has happened the last two years due to covet and and the issues and everything that's fallen behind and we were getting into some of those houses that well the one house i was in on friday they had been waiting seven months to get their master bath shower and everything back together how many would wait seven months you know no i'd want it done today another house that me and brother stephen worked all day and they've been in their house for about six months waiting for stuff to be completed and only about half of it came in so it's frustrating you know but it was all said and done we got the work done you know and we're able to go on so we give god thanks for that but you know there's a lot of frustration and a lot of hard hard times my son-in-law amos and abby the air conditioner went out but the part won't come in for two more weeks to fix it and we're used to being able to hit a switch and everything turns on but he's still with us you know sometimes it is it is hard or we get frustrated but we just have to remind ourselves but for the grace of god there go i in another situation my brother ronnie said you know yet when he finished a shower his eye was fine we serve a risen savior so this morning we just have a a simple thought but god's word is true you know sometimes and i've said this a few times you've probably heard me say it you know we want the the depth of the word we want and every part of the word god of god is effective and brother brandon just say that in this message he said after the opening of the seals and that's what i was looking this book became a new book to me and and he talks about it even when he's going to preach on the seals he said if the angel of the lord had not come into the room i would have preached them wrong he was reading what the other men had larkin and he mentions the man that and he was going to preach it that way but this was the unveiling of the word and god then sends his angel down to say this is what it is but i find in in just in in talking with different folks and and different ministers and and as we were all sitting in the minister's office there with brother aaron and them brother stephen asked us all to sit up front because it was going to be a a full saturday's usually the full day there and uh so he made sure he met us at the door and took us in so we couldn't get in and sit down and we just began to share things as ministers there was about 15 of us in there sharing experiences and all and all of us will admit there are hard times but all of us also said but he's kept us through them he's brought us through them he's met us he's taking care of us you know and and in ephesians and i don't believe you have this scripture i don't think i gave it to you there brother matt ephesians 4 13 but maybe you could pull it up and just something that came in and i just want to share this before we get in ephesians 4 13 till we come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ and sometimes we look at that word perfect means really means is as it should be but we look at ourselves and i say lord i'm not how i should be what your word says but i'm striving for that i'm desiring that a complete a whole i was thinking about it brother branham crossing on over to the other side and he's still in his body if you listen to him talking he's saying those feelings weren't there that he was expecting to have but they were on the other side they'd been glorified they'd stepped into that other theophany already and brother branham all he says i can't explain it to you all i can say to you is don't miss it how do i ask you to say but but here's paul saying till we come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of son of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ here's paul the first uh first stage messenger saying we've got to come to this it's something but it's not it's not a thing that he said you've got to come to it you're in trouble if you don't he's saying you've got to come to this but greater is he that is in you the one that is able to perform it because without him you're not going to do it you know just we all know those things and stuff like that at times that we can be happy we can be going and then something happens boy and our mood changes in a moment you know um this morning i um i i got up and and my wife always tells me take the clothes out and i'll iron it so i got up took a shower and i went over to get the clothes and the the coat and the pants are there but the shirt's not ironed and which she usually does sometimes i do it myself so i i don't know how she's going to take this but i didn't do it mean i went and i said and what about the shirt and she looks oh i forgot i just left it there and now the the reaction is mine now how do i react to that and i just laughed and i went and ironed it now it's under the coat so you really can't tell you know because sometimes iron and she says like oh you didn't do that party you missed this part but sometimes you know a reaction to an action and and just thinking about that how we react to things that happen to things we go and paul is saying we're going to come to the measure of the stature of a perfect man in the fullness of one who even though we're touched by the feeling of the infirmities we can have the same reaction as christ and say i'll bear it i'll go with it i'll help you i'm willing to share that it says here noah webster define unity as a meaning a a condition of harmony you know and and to to see some of those things that even brother branham said about it uh the condition of and it's not just faith but the faith many people have faith but where is your faith based on based on this government based on on on this situation the the boss of your work he's going to be able to keep it all no it's based on the word of god the only thing that doesn't fail he says and he said it's the word in us that eternal part of god that he placed in us before the foundation of the world there wasn't a thing that says when you get to this point brother lyle you've earned it no it was in you already that will spring forth with the very life of god it will grow within our souls until we show the exact life of christ living in flesh again through us see he was that first example but he said see you're going to come to that same plane but i'm just the first fruits i'm just the wave offering there's another harvest coming in behind us and brother branham says this that's my message to you church that's you that's a union spiritual union by the word that you're dead to those old husbands you're born anew don't try to dig him up he's dead if you're a born-again christian that little germ that was predestinated to you it's the word coming on word on word on word onward and come into the full stature of christ that's right and then he says this so he can come get his bride now we're just ready for one thing that's the coming of the lord that's my desire how that's your desire also and to think of that waiting on that one thing for the coming of the lord the invisible union of the of the bride of christ and and this was a thought that went with this and i'm going in a certain direction here um reading between the lines i was reading some things where brother brandon was talking about reading between the lines and he's talking about when sister branham would send him a letter when he was gone and i put the kids to bed he said but i know what she's saying because i know her and i was thinking about reading between the lines and there's only one author of this book do we know who that is was it moses authored this book no it was the holy spirit that authored this book who gave them the inspiration to do there's only one author of this book and when and we we we say reading between the lines what is it but i find that so many times and i've experienced this where you're talking to someone they're reading between the lines they said the holy spirit has revealed this to me and this one says it and this one says it this one says it but all three are in disagreement and that's the hard part because you're saying the holy spirit revealed it to you this way and you're saying the holy spirit reality and you're saying the holy spirit yet it doesn't it doesn't match would not the author of the book reveal it the same way so that it performs the same does that mean that i have to say it exactly like you said no but the spirit should be the same it should bring the same result if it's the life of a lemon in the seed what is it going to give a lemon an orange what it is now brother branham says you can take that and plant it in the citrus tree and it'll give a lemon but if the original tree puts forth fruit it's going to be what the original tree is so i just just you know just some things that you hear sometimes and you you talk to folks and and different things and i'm glad glad for his grace i'm glad for his mercy because if it if it had to be that we had to score a hundred percent on every single test we would we would fail but his grace and mercy reach us down and says one more time till we come into that fullness brother brandon you have this quote there brother matt ashamed and 65 brother brahm says when you have met god and the god who doesn't fail the god who does exactly what he said he would do he has always done it you're not ashamed of it then you don't have to walk back and be embarrassed about it you can tell the whole world when a man meets god talks to him and the reality of god becomes his in his heart he's not ashamed of it is it you or is it god manifesting himself in you that's what makes us where we're not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ it's christ in us the hope of glory it's become a reality like brother ronnie would stand up here and say i asked him and he did it and i'm not ashamed of that god because he keeps his word you know if if you work with with some folks and we were talking about it here with the one one of the superintendents and and they made this comment because we picked up a lot of new work taken over jobs finishing from other companies and i said you know we're buried also there's only three of us and we're buried but you guys keep giving us more work he said but you guys come back to finish the work the other company puts it in and believes that we can never get them back to come and do what we paid them to do and i even had one person ask me one superintendent he asked me he says do you think you do your job above and beyond more that's inspected of you how would you rate yourself well i had never been asked that question i had to stop for a moment think about and i said no i wouldn't put myself as above and beyond i just feel that i'm doing my duty i'm doing what i'm supposed to do i'm doing what's expected to me and so i just said why do you ask that question it was i'd never been asked that before and he goes because you come and you do your job you follow through you come through you fix it you do this whatever that is and my thought was well that's what i'm supposed to do i don't find it surprising i don't find it like oh really i thought that's what i was hired to do come to work and day and give my best every day now that doesn't always happen but that's what we're supposed to do and so he began to tell me the performance of the other person that i had replaced he said we never saw him and the work never got done and i said well i it just didn't occur to me that that would be that way but as you get to work and say fine people are that way but i serve a living god a real god a god who said i'm going to go down and take your place i'm going to walk in your shoes i'm going to go through everything you're going to have to go through and i'm going to bear it myself so that when you ask me about it and you ask for help and you talk to me i understand exactly where you're coming from and for that's why i say i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it's a power of god unto salvation to everyone that believes and he's faithful brother ron he gave that testimony he's faithful he never fails he says he's not ashamed of you're not ashamed of it and god is not ashamed to call you his own and the message expectation the other quote that was on there just a little bit longer so here she come along with this baby speaking of mary walking along i can see people come by saying wonder why they're staying away from that little girl oh my look at her with that swaddling's cloth my that must be a poor kid well we're we're refined we go to a better church and we don't have to fool with nothing like that here sat an old man back there oh he had a little spot of peace in him back here i can hear him sitting there reading the scriptures all at once the holy ghost now look if god gave simeon the holy ghost gives him this promise that he wasn't going to die till he seen the christ of god the holy ghost is under obligation to see that he sees the christ then if god gave you a promise god is under obligation to fulfill that promise there you there where you can hang your eternal destination on god's word because he keeps his word i really like that right there where he said that that's right he made him the promise he's obligated he says i hope you're getting between the lines here and that's the work of the holy spirit to reveal it to you the holy spirit's obligated to the word god's obligated to his word he certainly is i'm obligated to my word and you're obligated to your word and if your word's no good then you're no good if god's word's no good then i can't worship god he says because there i wouldn't believe there was any if he wouldn't back his word that's true so then i see her moving along there's simeon he's setting their reading and all at once christ is in the temple the holy ghost had given him that promise the holy ghost knowed all about that still you see simeon sitting there reading he says simeon stand up on your feet simeon said yes lord he laid it down and that was the voice of the holy ghost i can hear him and say stand up start walking where lord he said just walk i'll take care of the rest of it and sometimes that's the hard part getting up and starting walking with god hasn't told you why or what yet but you've learned and understood enough now that when he says get up and walk you get up and start walking and that that's that that's that's the son and daughter of god he says just walk i'll take care of the rest of it how am i going to walk after i get out of this stretcher i don't know he will take care of the rest of it see just start walking see when he tells you how am i going to get out of this wheelchair i don't know but you just keep walking he'll take care of the rest how am i going to get over the cancer heart trouble i don't know just take his word and keep walking he will take care of the rest of it see he's obligated to his word that's right how am i going to tell my mother if i get the holy ghost and my daddy they belong to a different church just get it he will take care of the rest of it you see you don't have to worry about that he'll take care of it how will i face my school my playmates don't worry just keep going he will take care of that and we've all been there what's going to happen what's god said i'll take care of it i'll go with you i'll not leave you you know i've shared this with you of that young lady at school when we were working in the office and she will always wear a long sleeve even in the summer because we went year round school so he went through summer also and they asked her there's about seven or eight of us sitting in that little office just they would send us out to to take stuff out to the teachers and things and somebody asked her and she said why do you always wear a long sleeve and i knowing that she was a christian she was a pentecostal christian i've said okay now i get to hear the answer and she kind of just i didn't say a whole lot and then she said um because i'm always cold in the middle of summer and then somebody else says something and she goes and this one was to me was more embarrassing she said i have very hairy arms now to hear a girl say that that that's what would be quite a bit and i'm just waiting i'm waiting and waiting and she knows you know we've had enough conversation she knows where i stand and all and finally she just says well as a christian i believe that i should be you know dressed modestly but it took about five minutes for that answer and then she looks at me she goes you thought i was never going to say it huh i felt bad for her no question about it but i don't ever want to get to the place that i'm so embarrassed that they have to question me question me question me and ask me but i'd be willing to say because i love the lord jesus and that would be the testimony and so simeon he just tells them don't worry about it simon just get up and start walking just start doing what god has asked you to do and he'll keep you he'll watch over you ephesians 1 16 we'll get into some scriptures here and again just talking where he says here reading between the lines that's the job of the holy spirit to tell you what this means what god meant by that what this is and you can ask him you can pray saying lord i'm having some difficulty understanding what were you trying to tell me but i don't want my own interpretation of it i want to know what you said about it why you said about it why do you do this and that says and and i i just remember this and it i don't forget and and the two brothers one has passed on the other one is now a pastor and he's serving the lord and i don't know him now but years ago we were talking and we were just just young men then i didn't believe i was married yet and i just asked the two brothers i said if god is with us where are the miracles and they both turned around and looked at me and said brother we are so deep in the word today we don't need miracles god doesn't do that anymore well this heart of mind said no that's not the right answer i may not understand it but i serve a living god i know a god who's real he keeps he does and then i had never run into this also when i went to go pay the rent and the man asked me about my girls because they were little and mom always had him combed and dressed right and he asked me what church we go to and i told him he said what do you believe i believe jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and he began to tell me that no that ended with the disciples the apostles i hear brother branham say those things but i never run into it before because i was always in the pentecostal church that said jesus christ was still the same yesterday today forever and then into the message but here someone say no but god uses doctors and psychiatrists and hospitals and that was only for the disciples well my answer finally was you've come a little too late because i've met him already and i know him to be true and faithful that's again paul says i am not ashamed of the gospel of of christ for it is a power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek that's romans 1 16 i'm not ashamed of the gospel i'll say jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he can heal a disease he can heal his sickness he can take a situation and turn it you know i i i i wonder sometimes we may be in our mind and i've done it before so you know and just say is god even interested in this would be something that god would would deal with this you know it's it's you know something as humans were doing or whatever and i just remind me thinking about some mechanical problems on a car and this and i remember that brother brandon was traveling with that that group of men or the people and the car ran out of gas and they had no place to get gas and brother branham gets a thing of water and he pours it into the tank how many of you would let me take a five gallon jug and say brother just believe it i'm gonna pour this in your car well you're not brother bran brother bran was not god either but he served a living god and he knew this god to be true and i serve the same god and i know him to be true would you be willing to take a chance would you be willing to say lord like you did for him you'll still do the same he's more than able more than able jeremiah chapter 9 verses 23 and 24. i hit about five different thoughts and i was which way i'm going to go which one i felt last night the lord just shared some things with me thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this he said okay there is you're going to glory glory in this in other words be proud of it if i want to share this talk about this he says that he understandeth and knoweth me therein i know him i've met him i have a personal relationship with him he's been faithful he never fails he said that i am the lord which exercises loving-kindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord and the thought that was going there was along the line of of of where we glory and what what we put our trust in what what are we willing to share and sometimes and and we hear it you know well and i can say for myself i've been a christian my whole life that's all i've ever known but i'm not any closer to god because of that than anybody else just because i said i'm a christian my whole life well i've never done that sin and i've never done this wrong and i've never done that but have you done any one you're just as guilty as the next everyone caused him to go to calvary it didn't numb wasn't covered he said we don't glory glory that we have met him and we know him that he is our glory and then he says in psalms 89 verses 28 through 36 and he's speaking of david here but we know this speaks of christ because brother branham says and brother green reminded us over when you read this scripture if you don't see christ in every verse he says go back and read it again my mercy will i keep for him forevermore put your name in there and my covenant shall stand fast with him his seed also will i make to endure forever and his throne as the days of heaven if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments he says then will i visit their transgression with a rod and their iniquity with stripes does anybody see death in there he said then i will utterly destroy them no he said i will visit them and i will as a father treat them see the difference there he says then i will visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes but you also see if you put jesus christ in there who he visited on who bore it for you who took it for you because we have all sinned and come short of the glory of god not one of us can stand in any righteousness then he says nevertheless my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithful to fail even though it has i have to do this he said it's not unto death my covenant will i not break or alter the thing that is gone out of my lips once i have sworn by my holiness that i will not lie unto david his seed shall endure forever and is thrown as a son before me and you go read david's life and boy did he fail god many a times but it was also speaking of christ he paid a debt he did not owe i owed a debt i could not pay he said i will not forsake that's why i say we are not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek now we'll get into the new testament and we've gone over this before but it just came fresh to me again and we use the word hope and the scripture uses the word hope quite often and and i know that sometimes people will say well you have to have faith and not hope but you can't live life without hope without some expectation of something to take place and hope has got to become faith but i found so many places in the new testament that paul refers to hope over and over and over and i began to think about this last night we had the the grandkids over friday night and they were there during the day yesterday and i finally had to say okay you're going to have to leave uh papa alone for a little while because i've got to get some some notes ready and of course they they they love the attention but grandma was there for them so she she was able to keep them out there for a while give me a chance to just choose to look into a little bit more of this and i began to look up all the new testament scriptures that have hope in it hope and it's quite a few and so what is that hope what what is that in i i believe i got a definition that i put in here to cherish a desire with anticipation uh we probably use the word hope i hope so i hope i can do it you know we probably use it a lot of times in a wrong a wrong way but to cherish a desire with anticipation so it's more than just uh i hope it happens something in your size i have a hope knowing it's going to happen but you have to have an anticipation a desire for it they're also in in the scriptures paul uses and we'll get to but the word immutable it's an adjective it's a word that modifies a known or to make it more specific and it means unchanging over time or unable to be changed immutable god's word doesn't change with time neither is it unchangeable therefore i can place my hope in god's word and it has a firm anchor a firm hold and it's consistent it doesn't fail so looking at at some of these things that that um as i was looking at because sometimes you get a a a word or a thought and and you you think you know what the word means but you read some definitions and it includes a whole lot more you know of what god and god uses allow these words to be put in his scriptures how they translate because brother branham says this version of the bible was the one that god told them to use that's not to say that that you can't look up a word and see but when you realize what god was saying it just becomes more real to you greater to you uh romans 15 4. and these were some scriptures that used the word hope in them romans 154 for whatsoever things were written before time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope because without hope you're hopeless that's pretty simple description right without hope you're hopeless as watch you know there's been a lot of flooding this last couple of weeks all over the world actually more fires we're coming driving in and i said well if you go to the scripture this world is coming to an end and and we have a hope more than a hope a blessed assurance that we'll step from this life to that life as we were driving around up there and even my wife is looking and says oh look at that where the burning went through up in flagstaff and what was once beautiful solidly full of trees is now it's a wasteland and i looked at it i said the whole creation is groaning waiting for their redemption waiting for the purity of the air waiting for for everything of how it once was we don't know that there's a pull towards that you've had some wonderful times some great times and beautiful times and it's just a glimpse of that but there's something desiring as as we drove we went up the long way just drove around to a different part of arizona and got up to flagstaff and saw different parts and you look at the beauty of the creation of god and then you drive to another whole section it's completely burned from a fire and what was once beautiful and that was just a scarred land but there's life in there because after the rains he came back and there's rain coming back up because god promised that you know but just looking at we look at that that we might have hope that there is something that says yes lord you're the same yesterday today and forever first peter chapter 1 verse 18 through 21 for as much as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold because tomorrow silver and gold may be worthless in the sense of a commodity house change is so fast from your vain conversation your vain lifestyle how you lived before received by the tradition of your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained from before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god paul puts those two words together your faith and hope your hope and faith might be in god my hope is not in this government my hope is not in my bank account well but my faith is in this but my hope is in that no paul is saying put him both in the same place and that's god put him both in there he can take a penny and make it worth a million like that and i can take a million and make it worth a penny like that because he's god and i'm not you understand that place your hope and your faith in his word titus 1 2. i like i love these scriptures in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began you have to live with hope more than i hope the car starts this morning more than i hope let me just ask you this how many of you got up this morning went to the light switch and stood in front and said i hope you turn on i hope you turn on i hope you turn on anybody want to admit that this morning no we all got up hit the light switch we had paid the electric bill the electric company said if you pay the bill the electric will be on right that's kind of how it works none of us i don't think question that now if you didn't put any gas in the car and you've driven it for a couple of weeks you might be questioning whether it's going to turn on or not but if you've met the requirements of what you're supposed to do you just go do it and he says in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began paul is telling it's a sure thing it's an unfailing thing it's not something you have to question god has proven over and over and over that he cares for you that he watches over you that he meets your needs well brother aaron i didn't have a million dollars in my bank account but he still met your needs god knows what some might do with a million in the bank account it could be the worst thing to happen in your life to you god knows how to take care of his children then in hebrews 6 18 and 19. this is where the word immutable things hebrews 6 18 19 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us immutable unchangeable over time is not able to change he said who by god who cannot lie god keeps his word he's unfailing he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not affected by climate change i'm talking to my wife this morning there is going to be a climate change they just don't know what's really coming up but we're going to be restored back to what it was at one time you know i i don't know somebody asked me something about why does this world have to be burned up why does that have to be cleansed and on abra valley road when you no i'm sorry tangerine when you get off and go west it used to be the the county landfill there now it's a big mound of dirt with trees planted on the outside trying to make it look nice but the honest truth there's a pile of trash there and over time you get methane gas that comes out of there everything that it get that it produces which is rottenness so now they've opened another one in navra valley and it's a large dump site over there and sometimes i got to take some stuff out there and i asked the lady how long are they talking for this dump she said oh they said we can put a hundred years worth of dumping in this place that was her words to me a hundred years of trash going into the ground and i said oh for that day of redemption oh for that day of purifying why does god have to clean this place the same reason why he has to clean this one to take it back to its original state and this is what he's saying in hope of eternal life and by these immutable things things that cannot change to lay upon to lay hold upon the hope set before us jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever verse 19 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which endureth into that within the veil which entereth into the veil again paul is using the word hope rather than faith because there has to be a hope in you there has to be something that makes you get up and go again i know god will keep i've played my trust my hope my desire on what he has said my hope is built on nothing less than jesus christ in his righteousness whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made a high priest forever after the order melchizedek my hope is built on nothing less than jesus christ and his righteousness ephesians 17 and 18 17-18 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints the hope of his calling you're not basing it on what you're going to be able to do you're not basing your hope is if i can get to this then i can have that you're not basing in the hope of if i can perform this no it's his calling he's called you to this hope he's called you to what he's promised therefore that hope lies in you i know my redeemer liveth as job said without even having the revelation that we have today it wasn't required of him was required of us but he said i know my redeemer liveth and with these eyes i shall behold him something that will get you out of bed in the morning and said i can live this day because i have a hope and a living god more than a stone more than an idea more than somebody else is this that i've met him he's real he's the same yesterday today and forever amen brother ronnie we heard that testimony you say well that's a simple testimony he's jesus christ of every part you know i we we get to talking sometimes i was i was speaking to uh the one of the co-workers there and we were talking a little bit and my co-workers were one of the guys with the other trades and we began to share some things and when there's an opportunity you share the faith your hope with them you know sometimes you're in there for a minute you're out sometimes you spend half a half a day with a another group of workers and you do your best to share the hope that lies within you and why why do you feel that way why do you believe that why how can you be happy in a situation like this how can there be joy out of you how can you have such a a a positive testimony because i serve a living god and he's faithful and we were talking about him and and he said something and he mentioned that he was diabetic and i explained to him what i'd gone through i said but i serve a living god and he is more than able to keep and save and take care of and you know so i began to share him i began to tell him who this god is and why i have this hope because he's been real to me he's been and there's that opportunity to share the hope that lies within you whatever it might be we were ephesians 17 and 18 there eyes of your understanding be enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his entire of his inheritance in the saints he says you know somewhere here i missed a page there it is ephesians 1 we were 17 and 18 i'm just i thought i had missed missed a scripture after this brother matt was it colossians or did i skip a page there yes to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory christ in you the hope of glory i'm glad it's not aaron after producing his own hope his own ability his own chance his own i hope so it's more than i hope so it's christ in you the hope of glory something in me that tells me yes amen he's done the work he's paid the price he's already met what needs to be met he goes that's my hope and and just thinking about that what what is that hope what is that that gets us up in the morning that we look at a situation and said there's something beyond that some of that is from your previous experiences with god brother branham would talk about it driving down the road he said satan would sit on the seat next to him in the car and begin to question him and say what about that what about is it really really and then brother branham would then take back the experiences that he had with god and began to say then you tell me who was that and you tell me who was that and you tell me who was caused that he said after a little while satan would leave because if you stand faithful on god's word he'll back it up and it's the same thing that we have to do the same thing when i was down when i was hurting when i was this when i was that i turned to god and he was faithful maybe a memory back when you were five six seven eight years old and god met through a prayer through whatever as a child and you know that was god and sometimes you have to go back the far to remind yourself maybe it was just this morning like brother ronnie maybe it was something that happened a while back but you're encouraged by this and this is this is what it is christ in you the hope of glory and what is christ that is his word he is his word and you begin to encourage yourself through the word of god and says job says job said i know who my redeemer liveth and you go back and and and and read the beginnings david said cried out there and and through the book of psalms like especially psalms 119 standing on his word read through psalms 119 how david cries out in your word i have hoped in your word there constantly constantly brother abraham says word upon word word upon word word upon word word upon word never fails never did he throw feelings in the middle of that never did he say your bad or good experiences just stay with the word of god stay with the word of god and the word tells us to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory how many have that hope in them you know you have that hope in him can you recommend that hope to somebody else can you say i i see your situation that you call hopeless but i was there once before and i met the god of this word i met the god of this bible and now there's a hope i can't explain it i can't say do this do that do this do that and that'll give you that hope i'll just say meet him give your life to him and let him do for you what he's done for me paul peter says lord i'm going to stand with you i'll even go to the cross with you i'll not deny you and he's saying oh peter is just oh boy he's he's just oh he's got to stand he's going to take for jesus and jesus looks like turn around looks at him he says you're going to deny me three times peter the scripture doesn't record what went through peter's mind i'm sure it caught him by surprise because peter was well we know peter was pretty strong with his words quite often not me not me no lord i'm going to stay with you because you're going to before the rooster crows he said you're going to deny me three times and he did scripture says he did exactly that then peter says well obviously i'm lost i don't have a chance tomorrow i denied my very savior i couldn't even stand with in fact i ran i hid i even tried to act like the people around him that were crucifying him there's no hope for me there's no chance for me there's nothing left for me and on that resurrection day and jesus tells he says go tell my disciples to meet me and peter 2. see my hope is building on nothing less than jesus christ and his righteousness not because i was able to not because i boasted that i would stand with him and never fail him because he'll look at me he says oh you will but come on in whom he said is that that seed laid in it will bring forth what it's promised to do the musicians would come up on christ the solid rock i stand all others everything else is just sinking sad in in in our best intentions in our in our hardest want to and and i would say always have good intentions i would say live a life with good intentions you just can't always keep them but just can't because you can't keep them and throw your hands up say well i'll never do that again get up and go again but that word which is promise never fails even so come quickly lord jesus and i like the song that brother jordan had us sing justified now you know you've done it you can't take that out of his out of your mind but when he says you're justified it's not there anymore and you have to accept that for yourself and that can be the hardest part lord we thank you for your word a hope it's more than just a four-letter word it's more than just a yearning lord but it's a promise in your scriptures and your word never fails it doesn't return void there where he said it's christ in you the hope of glory without you lord there is no hope there is no no way to accomplish that for whose deeds whose goodness whose wealth or what could say this is enough no there was only one that paid the sacrifice that paid the amount or however we want to say it however we would try to say it they would say it was enough to hear you say this is my son in whom well please lord for each one of us lord we'll stand on your righteousness we'll stand on your word lord not of ourselves in jesus christ's name amen look at the words to that song my hope is built you believe him you believe his word is it one that you could say i recommend it to you amen my hope is built on nothingness than jesus blood and righteousness i dare not trust the sweetest ring but holy land on jesus name in christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand when darkness seems to hide his face i rest on his unchanging breaks in every high and stormy my anchor [Music] [Applause] sinking sand [Music] maybe if we just bow our heads for a moment here maybe someone would lift their hand and i'm not even going to look and said i've been a little wavering i've been a little questioned i've wondered it seems like sometimes my footing is not where it should be and or maybe you just got some questions that just haven't seemed to be answered yet you've wondered why and you'd raise your hand and say just remember me in prayer to just just stand on what god said lord i'm not looking maybe there's one today that's they've had a tough week maybe a tough month or a tough year now and they're wondering some of the things why lord but we look sometimes to the next day and say maybe i hope tomorrow's going to be a better day and i hope this is going to work out but lord let that blessed assurance settle in each heart lord that they would know that you have their best interest in your mind lord what's good for each one of them i would pray that today lord that blessed assurance would settle down in their hearts and saying lord i trust in you my hope is built on nothing less than jesus christ and his righteousness i would just pray for someone that would need that today maybe somebody listening in or they would stream this on another day lord archive it or somehow and it would need that help lord that you would meet them in jesus christ's name we pray amen my hope is in the lord from this time on it we'll stand together [Music] amen make that promise to yourself god knows my hope is [Music] my hope [Music] is brother jordan [Music] is [Music] from this time on [Music] forevermore brother jordan will finish here but just for tonight we're going to have a prayer a praise worship testimony service tonight if you have a song you would like to sing or even a song you'd like us to sing you have a testimony you'd like to share a praise tonight would be a good time to do that just come and bring your lick of fire whatever we do and let's just enjoy that maybe one of the brothers would have a little bit to share with us a word of the lord or something whatever it might be but come
