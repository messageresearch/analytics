[4:36] [Music]
[5:17] Good evening. I don't often get to do
[5:20] this, so I'm excited when I get to play
[5:21] guitar and song lead.
[5:23] Let's sing this song she's playing. And
[5:26] he walks with me.
[5:30] And he walks with me. And he talks with
[5:37] me
[5:39] and he tells me I am his own.
[5:45] [Music]
[5:47] And the joy
[5:50] we share
[5:52] as we tear
[5:54] there.
[5:56] none other
[5:59] has ever
[6:01] known.
[6:04] Let's sing that song, Sheltered Safe
[6:06] Within the Arms of God. Are you happy to
[6:08] be here tonight? It's going to be a good
[6:10] service. I'm excited. Brother Ly's
[6:14] getting ready and I know it's going to
[6:16] be good.
[6:17] Let's just worship tonight.
[6:21] I feel the touch
[6:25] of hands so kind and gentle.
[6:32] They're leading me
[6:37] in paths that I must draw.
[6:44] I have no fear
[6:48] when Jesus
[6:50] walks beside me.
[6:55] For I'm sheltered
[6:59] in the arms of God.
[7:05] So let the storms raise high, the dark
[7:11] clouds rise.
[7:13] They don't wor me
[7:17] for I'm sheltered safe within the arms
[7:23] of God.
[7:27] He walks with me
[7:31] and not on earth can harm me
[7:38] for I'm sheltered
[7:42] in the arms of God.
[7:48] Soon I shall hear
[7:52] the call from heaven's portal.
[7:59] Come home, my child.
[8:03] It's the last mile you must try.
[8:09] I'll fall asleep
[8:13] and wake in God's new heaven.
[8:20] For I'm sheltered
[8:24] in the arms of God.
[8:30] So let the storms rage high. The dark
[8:35] clouds rise.
[8:37] They won't worry me.
[8:41] For I'm sheltered safe within the arms
[8:46] of God.
[8:50] He walks with me
[8:54] and not on earth can harm me
[9:01] for I'm sheltered
[9:04] in the arms of God. Let's sing the
[9:08] chorus again.
[9:10] So let the storms raise high, the dark
[9:15] clouds rise.
[9:18] They don't worry me
[9:21] for I'm sheltered safe within the arms
[9:26] of God.
[9:30] He walks with me
[9:34] and not on earth can harm me.
[9:42] safe
[9:44] within the arms of God.
[9:48] [Music]
[9:50] Let's all stand to our feet.
[9:54] Let's sing that song. In my life, Lord,
[9:56] be glorified today.
[9:59] [Music]
[10:04] in
[10:06] my
[10:07] life.
[10:09] Lord,
[10:11] be glorified.
[10:15] Be glorified
[10:19] in
[10:20] my
[10:22] life.
[10:24] Lord,
[10:25] be glorified
[10:29] today.
[10:31] singing. Oh, in my
[10:35] life,
[10:37] Lord,
[10:39] be glorified.
[10:42] Be glorified
[10:46] in
[10:47] my
[10:49] life.
[10:51] Lord
[10:52] be glorified
[10:55] today in this church.
[10:59] In
[11:00] this church,
[11:04] Lord
[11:05] be glorified.
[11:08] Be glorified
[11:12] in
[11:13] this
[11:15] church.
[11:16] Lord
[11:18] be glorified
[11:21] today. Let's sing that again. In this
[11:23] church. In this church.
[11:29] Lord
[11:31] be glorified.
[11:34] Be glorified
[11:37] in
[11:39] this
[11:40] church. Lord
[11:43] be glorified
[11:46] today. Brother Daniel, if you want to
[11:49] come take the request in my
[11:53] life,
[11:55] Lord
[11:56] be glorified.
[12:00] Be glorified
[12:02] in
[12:04] my
[12:06] life, Lord.
[12:09] be glorified
[12:12] today.
[12:14] Amen. Brother Ron Glidewell, if you
[12:16] would come and take the uh take the
[12:19] prayer requests here. I'll read them if
[12:20] you'll come and pray over him, my
[12:22] friend. Um
[12:24] [Music]
[12:27] first, Brother Ed Dooall
[12:30] writes this. He says, "Please pray for
[12:33] our 8-year-old grandson, Josiah,
[12:36] who was taken to Banner Hospital after
[12:39] he was struck in the face with the
[12:40] baseball bat while playing baseball. The
[12:43] scan shows a fracture of the orbital
[12:46] bone at his left eye. They are waiting
[12:50] for a neurologist and a doctor from the
[12:53] trauma opthalmology
[12:55] to see him." Brother Ed Dugal, I saw
[12:58] brother Ed show me a picture of the
[12:59] young man and it's he's got a pretty uh
[13:04] pretty banged up eye there. It's swollen
[13:05] all the way shut. And then
[13:09] um Sister Sharon writes uh an unspoken
[13:13] prayer request for her her friend
[13:16] Michelle. Brother,
[13:20] [Music]
[13:23] brothers and sisters,
[13:25] as always,
[13:28] we come to church and we come to church
[13:31] to worship. We come to church to be here
[13:34] for each other, but also we can come to
[13:36] church to be prayed for.
[13:38] Yeah.
[13:38] And we can come to church to receive an
[13:41] an answered prayer for something that we
[13:43] have a need of in our lives. So, if you
[13:46] have a need, something on your on your
[13:48] life or in your heart that you you'd
[13:50] like to make known to the Lord with an
[13:52] uplifted hand, just raise your hand with
[13:54] faith that he is able to answer and that
[13:56] he will answer.
[13:59] [Music]
[14:03] I've been healed so many times and so
[14:06] many prayers.
[14:07] It just is miraculous how God continues
[14:11] and each time we we come across these
[14:14] incidents we still we request him well
[14:16] Lord will you do it but then he he's so
[14:20] merciful and kind.
[14:21] Amen.
[14:21] With our little bit of unbelief he by
[14:24] grace he overlooks it and answers our
[14:26] prayers.
[14:27] Amen. So, let's just pray tonight and
[14:30] just look unto that kind, merciful God
[14:34] full of grace and have compassion on
[14:37] those that really need our prayers. And
[14:40] I believe this God that we serve and
[14:42] love and called us, I believe he'll look
[14:45] down and I believe he'll answer these
[14:48] prayers. Heavenly Father,
[14:51] we sincerely come before you through the
[14:54] shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[14:57] First of all, Lord, asking us that you
[14:59] would hide our sins. Remove him from us,
[15:02] Lord, that our prayer would not be
[15:04] hindered. To each and everyone that's
[15:06] represented here tonight, this little
[15:09] boy, Lord, that's he's suffering. I I've
[15:12] been a child. I And each one of us have
[15:15] been young and we've had incidents in
[15:17] our lives that we just wonder that if
[15:20] this is it, Lord, if you'll ever heal
[15:22] us, if we'll ever be well again. But we
[15:24] know you're faithful, Father. So give
[15:26] this little child some comfort tonight,
[15:28] Lord, and and that he would heal
[15:31] perfectly,
[15:32] that he would not have to suffer too
[15:34] much pain through this, Lord. You would
[15:36] have a compassion on him. And Lord, the
[15:38] unspoken request sometimes, Father, we
[15:41] just we don't know how to speak out what
[15:44] we need. And there are so many, Lord,
[15:46] that we love and care about our
[15:48] neighbors and our families.
[15:51] Lord, oh God, the we see the the ones on
[15:54] the streets, Father, and they stumble
[15:56] and and our hearts are broken, Father,
[15:59] somehow, oh God,
[16:02] somehow, oh God, would you meet the
[16:04] needs of these people as long as your
[16:06] people are here, Lord? I believe the
[16:09] world has an advocate before the father.
[16:11] So we do not want to shun this
[16:14] responsibility as sons and daughters of
[16:16] God to pray on their behalf. father. But
[16:19] as we know, Job, Lord, he he sacrificed
[16:23] for his children just in case they had
[16:25] sinned. So Lord, we bring our sacrifice
[16:27] before you on the on this case for these
[16:30] people, Father, that you would look down
[16:33] upon them with with mercy and kindness
[16:35] and look upon our hearts and and forgive
[16:38] us our sins and hear our prayers. In the
[16:40] name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen.
[16:43] Amen.
[16:45] Before
[16:47] we have our seats, let's sing the song
[16:49] uh Winds of Faith. I didn't give you
[16:50] that one before. Set your wings to the
[16:52] winds of faith. We'll do it in D.
[16:55] There are two roads
[16:59] you may take,
[17:04] one by side
[17:08] and one by faith.
[17:12] Take the word of God.
[17:16] For what you see,
[17:19] [Music]
[17:20] what you believe
[17:24] is what will be.
[17:28] And set your wings
[17:32] to the winds of faith.
[17:37] You can fly
[17:40] in a higher place.
[17:45] Do not struggle.
[17:49] It's by grace.
[17:53] Set your wings
[17:56] to the winds of faith.
[18:01] And what's your need?
[18:05] What's your cry?
[18:09] What's your mountain?
[18:12] [Music]
[18:13] Much too high. Speak the word of God.
[18:17] Just speak the word of God.
[18:21] By and by,
[18:25] it will move
[18:29] or you will fly.
[18:33] Oh, set your wings
[18:37] to the winds of faith.
[18:42] You can fly
[18:45] in a higher place.
[18:50] Do not struggle.
[18:54] It's by grace.
[18:58] Set your wings
[19:01] to the winds of faith. Watch the eagle.
[19:06] Watch the eagle
[19:10] in the sky.
[19:14] He does not struggle.
[19:18] He does not strive
[19:22] for the power
[19:26] that makes him rise.
[19:30] is already
[19:34] in the sky.
[19:38] Set your way
[19:41] to the winds of faith.
[19:46] You can fly
[19:50] in a higher place.
[19:54] Do not struggle.
[19:58] It's my grace.
[20:02] Set your wings
[20:06] to the wind. Let's sing verse two.
[20:08] What's your need?
[20:10] What's your need?
[20:14] What's your cry?
[20:18] What's your mountain?
[20:22] much too high.
[20:26] Oh, just speak the word of God.
[20:30] By and by,
[20:34] it will move
[20:38] or you will fly.
[20:42] Oh, set your wings
[20:46] to the winds of faith.
[20:50] You can fly
[20:54] in a higher place.
[20:58] Do not struggle.
[21:02] It's by grace.
[21:08] Ways
[21:10] to the winds of faith. Do not struggle.
[21:15] Do not struggle.
[21:19] It's by grace.
[21:23] Set your ways
[21:26] to the winds of faith.
[21:30] Amen. Be I forgot to have you do this.
[21:32] Before you have your seats, shake
[21:33] somebody's hand.
[21:35] [Music]
[21:46] Let's do that in E5.
[21:48] [Music]
[21:54] Do you know the verses? Do you know the
[21:56] verses?
[21:58] [Music]
[22:11] I'm amazed that he loved me.
[22:19] Oh, I'm amazed
[22:24] that you love me.
[22:28] I'm amazed
[22:32] how you care.
[22:36] Through your preious
[22:39] blood, I found pardon.
[22:44] And my sins
[22:47] are washed.
[22:49] They're all washed away. Oh, my sins
[22:55] are washed
[22:57] away.
[23:00] Oh, I'm amazed
[23:05] that you love me.
[23:09] I'm amazed.
[23:11] Yes, Lord. How you cared
[23:16] through your preious
[23:19] blood I found pardon.
[23:24] And my sins
[23:27] they're washed.
[23:29] They're all washed away. Oh my sins
[23:35] are washed. One more time.
[23:40] Yes, I'm amazed. amazed
[23:44] that you love me.
[23:48] I'm amazed
[23:52] how you care.
[23:54] [Applause]
[23:56] Through your preious
[23:59] blood, I found pardon.
[24:03] [Music]
[24:04] And my sins, they're washed.
[24:08] They're all washed away. Oh, my sins
[24:14] are washed away.
[24:20] Amen. As brother Lyall gets ready to
[24:23] come, let's sing He Looked Beyond My
[24:25] Fault in Bflat.
[24:29] He looked beyond my fault.
[24:32] Amazing
[24:34] grace
[24:37] shall always be my song. song of praise.
[24:44] For it was grace
[24:49] that brought my liberty.
[24:56] I do not know
[25:01] just why he came to love me so.
[25:08] He looked beyond
[25:12] my fault and saw my need.
[25:20] I shall forever
[25:25] lift mine eyes to Calary
[25:32] to view the cross
[25:36] where Jesus died for me.
[25:43] How marvelous
[25:48] the grace that caught my falling soul.
[25:55] He looked beyond
[25:59] my fault and saw. Let's sing the first
[26:04] first verse again. Amazing
[26:09] grace
[26:11] shall always be my song of praise.
[26:18] For it was grace
[26:23] that bought my liberty.
[26:30] I do not know
[26:34] just why he came to love me so.
[26:42] He looked beyond
[26:46] my faults and saw my needs. As brother
[26:50] Lyall comes,
[26:53] I shall forever
[26:58] lift mine eyes to Calary
[27:04] to view the cross
[27:08] where Jesus died for me.
[27:15] How marvelous
[27:20] the grace that caught my falling soul.
[27:27] He looked beyond
[27:31] my fault and saw my needs.
[27:37] Is that what he did for you?
[27:39] Yes.
[27:40] He looked beyond my faults. He looked
[27:43] beyond this guy.
[27:46] And saw my needs. And what were my
[27:48] needs? What is our greatest need?
[27:52] Jesus Christ
[27:53] in our life. He saw that empty spot that
[27:56] only he could fill.
[27:59] I'm so grateful.
[28:00] God bless you. Thank you so much. Thank
[28:03] you so much. Good evening.
[28:07] I'm excited to be here tonight.
[28:10] Tonight we'll take a look together at
[28:13] the book of the prophet Nahim as we call
[28:16] him in English and in Hebrew his name is
[28:18] Nahum but I'll be careful to try and not
[28:21] say that. The background image of this
[28:23] title slide you see is a portion of the
[28:25] book of Nahim from the Lenenrad Codeex.
[28:29] It's the oldest known complete Hebrew
[28:31] Bible. It was written by hand just over
[28:34] 1,000 years ago.
[28:36] Before we dig into Nahm, let's stand
[28:39] together
[28:41] and approach the Lord together as one
[28:44] body, united in prayer.
[28:49] Lord Jesus,
[28:52] it's such an awesome responsibility to
[28:54] be here, but it's such an amazing
[28:57] privilege to be gathered with your
[28:58] people, the bloodbought saints of God,
[29:02] Lord, that you reached down in 2024 and
[29:05] said, "Those are mine. Don't mess with
[29:08] them. Those are my kids." Lord, I'm
[29:11] grateful for the opportunity to be here.
[29:13] Lord, I pray that the words that are
[29:15] spoken be words that will encourage,
[29:17] that will uplift, and will point us to
[29:19] you. Thank you, Lord. Forgive me of my
[29:22] sins. Lord, let this rascal Lyall
[29:24] Johnson just not be here tonight, but
[29:26] may you be here in our midst and speak
[29:29] and move. We thank you in Jesus precious
[29:32] name. Amen.
[29:36] For our opening verses,
[29:39] we'll read from two places that parallel
[29:41] part of Nahim's message of chapter 1.
[29:44] The first is from Exodus
[29:48] chapter 34:es 6 and the first part of
[29:51] verse 7. It says, "And the Lord passed
[29:54] by before Moses and proclaimed the Lord,
[29:58] the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
[30:03] longsuffering,
[30:04] abundant in goodness and truth, keeping
[30:08] mercy for thousands of generations,
[30:11] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[30:14] sin that will by no means clear the
[30:18] guilty." I know it doesn't say
[30:20] generations there, but when you look at
[30:22] the context, he's speaking specifically
[30:24] of generations. Here we see God's mercy
[30:28] and his grace as well as his justice.
[30:32] And next, as you might guess, will be
[30:35] somewhere else. It'll be the first
[30:37] psalm.
[30:40] Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[30:42] the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
[30:45] in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the
[30:48] seat of the scornful, but his delight is
[30:51] in the law of the Lord, and in his law
[30:53] doth he meditate day and night. He shall
[30:56] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[30:59] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[31:01] his season. His leaf also shall not
[31:03] wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall
[31:06] prosper. The ungodly are not so, but are
[31:09] like the chaff which the wind driveth
[31:12] away. Therefore, the ungodly shall not
[31:15] stand in the judgment, nor sinners in
[31:17] the congregation of the righteous. For
[31:19] the Lord knoweth the way of the
[31:21] righteous, but the way of the ungodly
[31:24] shall perish.
[31:26] Please be seated.
[31:32] The book of Nahm deals specifically
[31:35] with the city of Nineveh, the capital of
[31:38] the Assyrian Empire, the the same
[31:40] Nineveh to which Jonah had been sent.
[31:42] About a hundred years had passed since
[31:44] Jonah was there. Around 40 years after
[31:48] Jonah's ministry, Assyria conquered
[31:51] Israel, the northern kingdom, exiled the
[31:54] inhabitants, repopulated it with people
[31:56] from other captured lands. Assyria also
[32:00] subjugated Judah, making it a vassal
[32:02] state.
[32:04] In spite of the idealic representation
[32:06] in this painting, the Assyrians were a
[32:08] violent, brutal people.
[32:12] We'll see in Nahm very specific
[32:15] statements about the future destruction
[32:17] of Nineveh. Please keep in mind as we go
[32:21] through this book, Nineveh is both the
[32:24] object of the prophecy and an example.
[32:28] Nineveh represents evil, brutal, and
[32:30] unjust political powers as well as those
[32:33] who reject the Lord. The message of
[32:36] Nineveh's particular destruction is a
[32:38] warning that while evil may persist
[32:41] until the end of all things, every evil
[32:43] tyrant and system will fall. God is a
[32:48] God of justice, mercy, love, and grace.
[32:53] He does not tolerate injustice. He will
[32:55] ultimately punish those who promulgate
[32:58] and propagate it.
[33:02] Nahm is the seventh among the group we
[33:04] call minor prophets. The prophecies of
[33:07] the minor prophets are just as
[33:08] authoritative as those of the major
[33:11] prophets. It's the word of the Lord. The
[33:14] subject or coverage of their prophecies
[33:16] is usually more tightly focused or
[33:18] narrower in scope than the major
[33:20] prophets.
[33:23] Nahim in Hebrew nah is a name which
[33:27] means comforter.
[33:30] However, the root word is a verb nam
[33:35] which means he judges, he avenges, he
[33:38] punishes.
[33:40] In this book, we'll see the Lord is
[33:43] simultaneously being both a comforter
[33:46] and the avenger.
[33:51] The book is short, has only three
[33:53] chapters. This is one breakdown I found
[33:55] of its topics. There are only a total of
[33:58] 47 verses in this prophecy.
[34:02] So, we'll read it all this evening.
[34:05] By the way, it was originally written as
[34:08] a poem.
[34:10] Before we read, of course, we need
[34:13] context.
[34:15] Let's start with geography. This is a
[34:17] view from space showing Jerusalem and
[34:20] Nineveh.
[34:22] We have no record that Nahm physically
[34:24] went to Nineveh, but the prophecy is
[34:26] also meant as a comfort and assurance to
[34:28] God's people in Judah.
[34:31] As we discussed under Jonah, the
[34:33] distance between the cities is about 500
[34:36] miles by trade routes of the day,
[34:37] approximated by the yellow arrow.
[34:41] As you view this photograph from space,
[34:43] you can see the band of green from the
[34:46] lower right going on up through the top
[34:48] and down to the Mediterranean coast. It
[34:50] forms a crescent. And this is, if you've
[34:53] studied in geography and so forth in
[34:55] school many years ago for some of us,
[34:58] many decades ago for others of us, uh
[35:00] this is the so-called fertile crescent
[35:02] of ancient civilization.
[35:06] We're told that Neahim was an Elcoite,
[35:10] but there's no certainty as to where
[35:12] this town or village might have been.
[35:14] One theory, and I emphasize it's not
[35:16] certain, is that he was from what became
[35:19] known as the village of Nahm.
[35:22] In our Bibles, this is translated as
[35:24] Capernaum.
[35:26] In Hebrew, Gafarum,
[35:28] village of Nahim.
[35:31] This map shows it was on the northern
[35:32] shore of the Sea of Galilee. We know it
[35:35] was from here that Jesus based much of
[35:37] his ministry. The inset shows a present
[35:40] day aerial view of the site of ancient
[35:44] Capernaum.
[35:47] This map, those of you sitting in the
[35:50] back, I hope you brought your opera
[35:51] glasses or something. We I I'm going to
[35:54] continue to make these smaller and
[35:56] smaller and smaller to encourage you to
[35:57] come closer.
[36:00] It shows the extent of the Syrian Empire
[36:02] at the time that Nahm foretold its
[36:04] destruction. The areas are in three
[36:07] shades of green, growing lighter as it
[36:09] expands.
[36:10] But they show its approximate extent. As
[36:13] you can see, it covered a huge and
[36:15] fertile area. Agriculture
[36:19] was key to the strength of an area in
[36:22] those days. Reliable and abundant crops
[36:26] meant a larger percentage of the
[36:27] population could be supported in other
[36:29] labor, including construction,
[36:32] manufacturing, military, and ancient
[36:35] societies. The majority of people are
[36:37] what we would today call subsistence
[36:39] farmers. There was little left over.
[36:42] Taxation, such as tithes of the Old
[36:44] Testament, were often measured in
[36:46] produce, not currency.
[36:49] You'll notice there are no definite
[36:51] borders. When the Bible speaks of
[36:53] nations, it's not speaking of our modern
[36:56] concept of political entities with
[36:58] recognized borders. Unless you happen to
[37:00] be in Ukraine and Russia's your
[37:02] neighbor, then they don't recognize it.
[37:04] But it's speaking of peoples of various
[37:07] geographic regions, what we might think
[37:09] of as large clans or ethnic groups. For
[37:12] example, Galilee of the nations means
[37:14] that area known as the Galilee had a
[37:17] population of various non-Jewish
[37:19] ethnicities from various regions.
[37:23] Assyria was at the height of its power
[37:26] and dominion, the mightiest empire known
[37:30] up to that time. It was at its peak.
[37:36] This is a photo of one of the gates of
[37:38] Nineveh. Uh the arrow is about six feet
[37:41] tall. The statue to the right of the
[37:43] arrow is of a lion with a human head and
[37:46] with wings guarding the entrance. This
[37:48] is a massive, breathtaking, intimidating
[37:52] structure showing the wealth and power
[37:54] of the city the gate protects.
[37:58] Nineveh was the largest city in ancient
[38:00] Assyria, the seed of government, the
[38:03] capital of the Assyrian Empire.
[38:08] Uh the book doesn't tell us when it was
[38:11] written, but it contains clues that help
[38:13] us. This timeline gives us an idea of
[38:16] when Nahm prophesied.
[38:19] Jonah went to Nineveh, the capital of
[38:21] Assyria about 760 BC, shown at the far
[38:25] left. Within some 40 years, Assyria
[38:28] conquered Israel in 723 or 722 BC.
[38:34] thieves. Thus, Egypt, thieves being the
[38:37] capital of Egypt, fell to Assyria in 663
[38:41] BC.
[38:42] Finally, Nineveh was destroyed and
[38:44] Assyria conquered by Babylonia in 612
[38:47] BC. I note for the kids here that BC
[38:50] years count down. So, 760 BC is almost
[38:53] 100 years earlier than 663 BC.
[39:01] In chapter 3:ES 8-10, Nahm tells us
[39:04] about the fall of thieves, the capital
[39:06] of Egypt, as something that has already
[39:08] happened, which occurred in 663 BC. It's
[39:11] predicting the destruction of Nineveh,
[39:14] which occurred in 612 BC. So, it narrows
[39:17] the time of his prophecy to somewhere
[39:19] between these two events, an uncertain
[39:21] span of some 50 years.
[39:26] This puts him in the reigns of Manasseh
[39:27] and Ammon, evil kings indicated in red
[39:31] andor Josiah who was a righteous king.
[39:34] Since the reconstruction of thieves in
[39:38] 654 BC is not mentioned, many narrow the
[39:41] time of Naam's prophecy to between 663
[39:44] and 654 BC during the reign of Manasseh,
[39:48] one of Judah's most wicked kings. It's a
[39:52] very dark time in the history of Judah.
[39:55] Assyria had a strangle hold on the
[39:57] kingdom. It's shown by the left pointing
[39:59] arrow in red by Nahm's name. For those
[40:02] in Judah, Nahm's prophecy against
[40:05] Nineveh would be a ray of hope. Remember
[40:08] his name, comforter.
[40:13] Others point out that his near quote
[40:15] from Deuteronomy suggests it may have
[40:16] been after Josiah's reforms and the
[40:19] uncovering of the book of the law in the
[40:21] 18th year of his reign which was about
[40:23] 623 BC. This is indicated by the right
[40:27] pointing green arrow by Nahm's name.
[40:29] Josiah's name and reign also appear in
[40:31] green is he was a good guy.
[40:34] Regardless of when in this period Nahm
[40:37] prophesied, Assyria had conquered Israel
[40:40] and dispersed its people between 60 and
[40:43] 100 years earlier and subjugated much of
[40:46] Judah for a similar number of years.
[40:51] This map again shows the extent of the
[40:53] Syrian Empire with thieves indicated
[40:55] along with the date of its and Nineveh's
[40:58] fall.
[41:02] What do you think of in your mind or
[41:04] what do you visualize when we speak of
[41:06] one of these Old Testament prophets?
[41:09] What do you see?
[41:12] We might think of guys in robes sitting
[41:15] on a hill, maybe watching some sheep,
[41:20] riding on a parchment or a scroll.
[41:23] The reality was much different. Imagine
[41:27] if you can
[41:29] this week,
[41:32] God raising up a Jewish prophet from
[41:35] Israel
[41:37] and sending him to Tehran to tell the
[41:39] Ayatollah to repent that Islam is
[41:42] offensive to God.
[41:44] or perhaps to Red Square in Putin's
[41:46] Moscow or to Anaman Square in Beijing to
[41:49] protest the policies of Zimping
[41:52] or to Pyongyang to cry out against the
[41:54] injustices of the Kim Jong-un regime.
[41:58] This is the sort of courage and faith
[42:02] that was required of men like Jonah and
[42:06] Nah,
[42:08] not sitting on a hill facing tyrants.
[42:13] with this background and this context.
[42:16] Let's read
[42:20] the introduction. The first verse
[42:21] introduces us to the prophet and the
[42:24] focus of his prophecy. And by the way,
[42:27] you young people, if you haven't already
[42:29] got one, there's exams in the back for
[42:31] you to take little quizzes. You won't be
[42:34] graded, but if you get a hundred, you
[42:35] can draw a smiley face on it when we're
[42:37] done.
[42:39] the burden or oracle or prophecy of
[42:43] Nineveh.
[42:45] The book of the vision of Nahim the
[42:49] Elushite.
[42:50] As we mentioned earlier, Nahim means
[42:53] comforter while his name is derived from
[42:56] to avenge or to punish.
[43:00] Now we know what the book is about and
[43:02] who wrote it. The next portion of the
[43:04] first chapter tells us about God's
[43:07] character, his power. In a way, it's his
[43:10] qualifications to be prosecutor and
[43:13] judge in the case against Nineveh in
[43:15] particular and all the evil powers of
[43:17] injustice in general and of course makes
[43:21] him more than in a position to judge us.
[43:26] You'll notice in the remainder of
[43:28] chapter 1, Nineveh is not mentioned by
[43:31] name, only by inference.
[43:34] Let's read.
[43:37] God is jealous. It means he's angry. And
[43:41] the Lord revenges. He avenges. He
[43:43] punishes. The Lord revenges and is
[43:45] furious.
[43:47] The Lord will take vengeance on his
[43:49] adversaries. and he reserves, he guards
[43:52] his preserves wrath for his enemies.
[43:56] I' I've shown a little bit of the
[43:58] background of that old Hebrew text
[44:00] again. And in Hebrew, in biblical
[44:03] Hebrew, when something is repeated, it's
[44:05] for emphasis. It's to draw your
[44:07] attention
[44:09] here. There's an identical Hebrew
[44:12] phrase, no came Yahweh,
[44:15] about the Lord's vengeance. This
[44:19] identical pair of words appears three
[44:22] times in this verse.
[44:26] He is definitely making a point. The
[44:29] Lord is slow to anger and great in power
[44:33] and will not at all acquit the wicked.
[44:36] Exactly as we read in Exodus 34 in our
[44:38] opening verses.
[44:40] And now some examples of his power are
[44:42] stated. The Lord hath his way in the
[44:44] whirlwind and in the storm and the
[44:47] clouds by the dust of his feet. He
[44:49] rebukes the sea and makes it dry. He
[44:52] dries up all the rivers. Bashan
[44:55] languishes, droops, becomes weak and
[44:57] Carmel. The flower of Lebanon
[45:00] languishes. These are directions on the
[45:01] compass to the north and the east and
[45:03] the west. He sang all over the place.
[45:06] The mountains quake at him. The hills
[45:08] melt. The earth is burned at his
[45:09] presence. Yay, the world and all that
[45:12] dwell therein.
[45:14] Who can stand before his indignation?
[45:18] Who can abide in the fierceness of his
[45:21] anger? His fury is poured out like fire
[45:25] and the rocks are thrown down by him.
[45:30] Clearly no one can withstand him and he
[45:34] is clearly incensed at the inhumanity
[45:37] and injustice the evil perpetrated on
[45:39] men by other men.
[45:42] Next he inserts a word of encouragement
[45:44] to the faithful. The Lord is good a
[45:48] stronghold in the day of trouble
[45:51] and he knows them that trust in him.
[45:56] We sometimes sing a song. He knows my
[45:59] name. He knows my every thought. He sees
[46:02] each tear that falls and hears me when I
[46:05] call. Does he know your name?
[46:09] Does he know my name? Is your
[46:11] relationship with him secure
[46:15] as mine?
[46:17] Back to the case against Nineveh. With
[46:19] an overraning flood, he will make an
[46:22] utter end of the place thereof. The
[46:24] place in this case being Nineveh and
[46:27] into the realm of darkness shall pursue
[46:30] his enemies. You can't hide.
[46:34] Then he asks a question, what do you
[46:37] imagine against the Lord? He's asking
[46:41] this of the Ninevites. He will make an
[46:44] utter end. Affliction shall not rise up
[46:48] the second time. Nineveh, he'll destroy
[46:52] you completely with a single blow, and
[46:55] you'll not rise again.
[46:59] We'll see that that's true, that that
[47:01] came to pass. For for while they be
[47:03] folded together as thorns, and while
[47:06] they are drunken as drunkards, they
[47:08] shall be devoured as stubble, fully dry,
[47:11] utterly consumed.
[47:14] There is one come out of thee that
[47:17] imagines evil against the Lord, a wicked
[47:21] counselor.
[47:24] This is speaking of the king of Assyria
[47:26] who rules from Nineveh.
[47:31] But there's some good news for Judah.
[47:36] Thus saith the Lord, though they the
[47:39] Assyrians be quiet, and likewise many,
[47:42] yet thus shall they be cut down when he
[47:45] shall pass through. Though I have
[47:47] afflicted thee through the Assyrians, I
[47:50] will afflict thee by them no more. For
[47:54] now I will break his yoke from off thee,
[47:57] Judah, and will burst suddenly with
[48:00] great force burst thy bonds and sunder.
[48:04] I will destroy Assyria, never to rise
[48:07] again, to cause you to suffer. And the
[48:11] Lord hath given a commandment concerning
[48:13] thee, Nineveh,
[48:15] that no more of thy name be sown. Out of
[48:19] the house of thy gods will I cut off the
[48:21] graven image and the molten image. I
[48:24] will make thy grave. I will destroy and
[48:27] bury you. For thou art vile.
[48:32] The chapter ends with further
[48:34] encouragement to Judah. Behold upon the
[48:37] mountains the feet of him that bringeth
[48:39] good tidings, that publishes peace. And
[48:42] now we plea. Oh Judah, keep thy solemn
[48:44] feasts. perform thy vows for the wicked
[48:48] shall no more pass through thee. He is
[48:50] utterly cut off.
[48:52] Where have we seen this before?
[48:55] Nahm is repeating the words of another
[48:58] prophet Isaiah encouraging the people to
[49:02] never lose hope to keep trusting and
[49:04] serving the Lord. Isaiah 52:7, "How
[49:06] beautiful upon the mountains, are the
[49:09] feet of him that bringeth good tidings,
[49:11] that publishes peace,
[49:14] that brings good tidings of good, that
[49:16] publishes salvation, that sth unto Zion,
[49:18] Thy God reignth.
[49:21] Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice
[49:23] with a voice together shall they sing,
[49:25] for they shall see eye to eye, when the
[49:28] Lord shall bring again Zion. Break forth
[49:30] into joy. Sing together, ye waste places
[49:35] of Jerusalem. For the Lord hath
[49:37] comforted his people. He hath redeemed
[49:40] Jerusalem. The Lord hath made bear his
[49:43] holy arm in the eyes of all the nations,
[49:46] and all the ends of the earth shall see
[49:48] the salvation of our God.
[49:52] So much like Nahm chapter one, the
[49:55] Lord's strength and power, his care for
[49:58] his people, their eventual redemption
[50:01] and restoration.
[50:05] Moving on, the destruction of the wicked
[50:08] city. Chapter two describes the progress
[50:12] of the invasion and the destruction that
[50:14] will come to Nineveh and Nahm's vision
[50:16] of the future
[50:19] and has come to Nineveh from our
[50:21] perspective of history of the past.
[50:26] Let's read.
[50:30] He that dasheth in pieces the army of
[50:33] the Babylonians and the Mes is come up
[50:36] before thy face Nineveh. Keep
[50:38] dimunition. Watch the way. Make thy loin
[50:41] strong. Fortify thy power mightily.
[50:44] Won't do you any good. For the Lord hath
[50:46] turned away. The Lord will restore the
[50:49] excellency of Jacob as the excellency of
[50:52] Israel. For the empters have emptied
[50:54] them out. The plunderers have taken
[50:57] everything and marred their vine
[51:00] branches.
[51:01] The shield of his of Nineveh's mighty
[51:04] men is made red. The valiant men are in
[51:07] scarlet.
[51:09] The chariots shall be with flaming
[51:10] torches in the day of his preparation.
[51:12] And the fur trees shall be terribly shak
[51:15] fur trees speaking of the shafts of the
[51:17] spears.
[51:18] These chariots racing over with these
[51:20] spearmen.
[51:22] The chariots shall rage in the streets.
[51:24] There'll be so many they'll justle one
[51:26] against another in the broad ways.
[51:28] They'll seem like torches. They'll run
[51:30] like the lightnings.
[51:34] He, the king of Nineveh, shall recount
[51:36] his worthies. He summons. He assigns his
[51:38] officers. They stumble in their walk.
[51:40] They shall make haste to the wall
[51:42] thereof. And the defense against the
[51:45] battering ram and the siege towers shall
[51:47] be prepared.
[51:49] The gates of the rivers shall be opened.
[51:52] The palace shall be dissolved. It was
[51:55] made out of mud brick. You get it too
[51:57] wet. It's got a problem. And huzab,
[52:00] which means that which was established.
[52:02] In other words, Nineveh and their
[52:04] systems shall be led away captive. She
[52:08] shall be brought up, and her maids shall
[52:10] mourn her as with a voice of doves
[52:13] softly tabing, meaning beating on their
[52:15] breasts. But Nineveh, as of old, like a
[52:19] pool of water.
[52:21] Yet they shall flee away. Nineveh was
[52:23] like a calm, placid, safe pool of water.
[52:28] But now the inhabitants are fleeing.
[52:31] Stand, stand, stop, stop, shall they
[52:34] cry, but none shall look or turn back.
[52:38] Take ye the spoil of silver. Take the
[52:40] spoil of gold. There is none end of the
[52:43] store and glory out of all the pleasant
[52:45] furniture, meaning pleasant furnishings,
[52:47] desirable objects.
[52:51] She is empty and void and waste,
[52:55] hollowed out, empty. The the Hebrew,
[52:58] this is again a a a thing where the word
[53:01] is repeated three times and the very
[53:04] sounds of the words, you can feel
[53:06] emptiness. It's uh it's bua va.
[53:12] The heart melts, the knees smite
[53:14] together, knees give way, people
[53:16] collapse. Much pain is in all loins.
[53:18] Bodies tremble. The faces of them all
[53:22] gather blackness, drained of color,
[53:25] become pale.
[53:27] Where is the dwelling of the lions? The
[53:30] feeding place of the young lions. where
[53:32] the lion even the old lion walked and
[53:34] the lion's welp and none made them
[53:36] afraid.
[53:38] Lions are a symbol of the power and of
[53:40] the powerful of Assyria. The lion did
[53:43] tear in pieces enough for his welps and
[53:45] strangled for his lionesses and filled
[53:47] his holes with prey and his dens with
[53:49] raven torn flesh.
[53:53] Behold, I am against thee, saith the
[53:56] Lord of hosts, and I will burn her
[53:58] chariots in the smoke, and the sword
[54:00] shall devour thy young lions, the
[54:02] warriors and princes of Nineveh. I will
[54:05] cut off thy prey from the earth. You no
[54:08] longer will have victims, and the voice
[54:10] of thy messengers shall be no more
[54:12] heard. You no longer sent emissaries to
[54:16] conquered lands, to lands which you
[54:17] desire to conquer. Recall the taunting
[54:20] of Rab Sheekcha telling Hezekiah to
[54:22] surrender Jerusalem to Sonakareb and 2
[54:25] Kings 18. The voice of such emissaries
[54:28] will be heard no more.
[54:32] I'd like to reread chapter 2 using a
[54:35] recent translation of the entire Hebrew
[54:38] Bible, the Old Testament, done by a
[54:40] fellow named Robert Alter over a period
[54:43] of some 40 years.
[54:45] We read the King James version just now,
[54:47] but the old formal style of King James.
[54:51] Um, something just happened there.
[54:55] Excuse me. Don't look.
[55:01] There we are.
[55:05] The the old and formal style of the King
[55:07] James loses some of its impact, at least
[55:09] for me. This is a chapter. It's filled
[55:12] with drama, with battle. There's detail
[55:15] in here. Overwhelming victory, crushing
[55:19] defeat. Alter's translation in modern
[55:22] English also tries to preserve some of
[55:24] the structure of the original, which
[55:25] which was a poem.
[55:28] The battering ram has come up against
[55:30] you. Put up a watch. Look out to the
[55:33] road. Brace yourself. Flex all your
[55:35] strength. For the Lord has brought back
[55:37] the pride of Jacob like the pride of
[55:39] Israel. For marauders have blighted them
[55:42] and ruined their branches. His warriors
[55:45] shields are reddened. The soldiers are
[55:47] stained crimson. This is a very bloody
[55:49] battle. Like torch fires are the
[55:52] chariots on the day they are made ready.
[55:54] And the cypress shafts referring to
[55:56] their spears are poisoned. Through the
[55:58] streets, the chariots run wild. They
[56:00] rumble through the squares. Their look
[56:03] is like torches. Like lightning they
[56:05] race. He calls out his staunch men. They
[56:08] stumble as they go. They rush to the
[56:10] wall and mantlets are set up. That's
[56:12] protections against battering rams and
[56:14] siege towers. The gates of the river are
[56:17] opened. The palace swept away. And the
[56:22] mistress is brought out, exiled, and her
[56:24] slave girls moan like doves beating on
[56:27] their chests. Nineveh in time past was
[56:30] like a pool of water. But now they flee.
[56:33] Stop. Stop. But none turns around. Loot
[56:36] the silver. Loot the gold. There's no
[56:38] end to the horde. Treasure of every
[56:40] precious vessel. Stripped and distraught
[56:44] and desoiled. Fainting heart and
[56:46] buckling knees, shuddering in all loins,
[56:49] all faces lose their luster.
[56:52] Where now is the den of the lions, the
[56:54] cave of the king of beasts. There the
[56:57] lion walked, the maimed beast there, the
[56:59] lion's cub with none to make them
[57:02] tremble. The lion tearing prey for its
[57:05] cubs, breaking necks for his lioness. He
[57:08] filled his lair with prey and his den
[57:10] with torn apart flesh.
[57:13] "Here I am against you," said the Lord
[57:15] of armies. "I will burn up your chariots
[57:17] and smoke, and your m beasts the sword
[57:20] shall devour. I will cut off from the
[57:22] earth your prey, nor shall the sound of
[57:25] your envoys be heard again."
[57:31] The symbol projected by, associated
[57:33] with, and mentioned certainly by Nahm
[57:36] with Assyria and Nineveh is the lion.
[57:39] It's no wonder Nahhem uses the lion in a
[57:42] symbolic way in these prophecies.
[57:45] The gates are guarded by winged lions
[57:48] and bulls with human heads.
[57:53] Well, chapter 3 completes the book by
[57:57] describing the injustices that were the
[57:59] foundation of Nineveh's might and
[58:02] wealth. In modern terms, we'd refer to
[58:05] Assyria as a terrorist empire.
[58:10] Woe to the bloody city. It is full of
[58:14] lies and robbery. The prey departs not.
[58:17] There's no escape for its victims. The
[58:20] noise of a whip, the noise of the
[58:23] rattling of the wheels, and of the
[58:24] prancing horses, and of the jumping
[58:27] chariots. The horsemen lifteth up both a
[58:30] bright sword and the glittering spear.
[58:33] There's a multitude of slain, a great
[58:35] number of carcasses.
[58:37] There's no end to their corpses. They
[58:39] stumble upon their corpses.
[58:43] The next verse is symbolic of the
[58:45] worship of false gods, especially evil,
[58:47] given the ministry of Jonah more than a
[58:49] century earlier, because of the
[58:51] multitude of the whoredoms of the
[58:53] well-favored harlot, the mistress of
[58:55] witchcrafts that selleth nations through
[58:57] her whoredoms, and families through her
[59:00] witchcrafts. Behold, I am against thee,
[59:03] saith the Lord of hosts. I will discover
[59:06] thy skirts upon thy face. I will show
[59:09] the nations thy nakedness, and the
[59:11] kingdoms thy shame. I will cast
[59:14] abominable filth upon thee, and make
[59:17] thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing
[59:20] stock.
[59:22] And it shall come to pass that all look
[59:24] upon thee shall flee from thee, and say,
[59:27] Nineveh's laid waste.
[59:30] Who will be moan? Who will grieve for
[59:32] her? Whence shall I seek comforters for
[59:35] thee?
[59:36] Art thou better than populace? No.
[59:39] Thieves modern day lux or ancient
[59:42] capital of Egypt that was situ among the
[59:45] rivers that had the waters round about
[59:47] it whose rampart was the sea and her
[59:50] wall was from the sea. Ethiopia and
[59:53] Egypt were her strength and it was
[59:55] infinite. Their support was without
[59:57] limits.
[59:58] Put and lubam were thy helpers.
[1:00:02] And a horrific description follows. Yet
[1:00:05] was she carried away? She went into
[1:00:07] captivity. Her young children also were
[1:00:11] dashed in pieces at the top of all the
[1:00:13] streets. They cast lots for her
[1:00:16] honorable men. And all her great men
[1:00:20] were bound in chains.
[1:00:24] Thieves called no short for no ammon was
[1:00:28] the capital of upper Egypt.
[1:00:30] Archaeological excavations are ongoing
[1:00:33] and much has been uncovered in the last
[1:00:35] 20 years, the Necropolis, a valley of
[1:00:37] the kings is just across the Nile.
[1:00:41] Nahim is telling Nineveh that just as
[1:00:43] they conquered and desecrated that city,
[1:00:46] a similar fate awaits them. Remember,
[1:00:50] Egypt had been one of the mightiest
[1:00:52] empires in the ancient world. The next
[1:00:55] five verses detail what shall befall
[1:00:58] Nineveh.
[1:01:00] Thou also shall be drunken. Thou shalt
[1:01:02] be hid. Thou also shalt seek strength
[1:01:05] because of the enemy. All thy
[1:01:07] strongholds shall be like fig trees with
[1:01:10] the first ripe figs. If they be shaken,
[1:01:13] they shall fall even into the mouth of
[1:01:15] the eater.
[1:01:18] Behold, thy people in the midst of thee
[1:01:20] are women. He's saying, your mighty army
[1:01:23] is weak. The gates of thy land shall be
[1:01:26] set wide open unto thine enemies. The
[1:01:29] fire shall devour thy bars. Draw thee
[1:01:32] waters for the siege. Fortify thy
[1:01:35] strongholds. Go into clay and tread the
[1:01:37] mortar. Make strong the bit brick kiln.
[1:01:40] Go ahead and prepare. It will do you no
[1:01:43] good. It will provide you no safety.
[1:01:47] There shall the fowl devour thee. The
[1:01:50] the fire shall devour thee. The sword
[1:01:52] shall cut thee off. It shall eat thee up
[1:01:55] like the cankerworm. Make thyself many
[1:01:57] as a cankerworm. Make thyself many as
[1:02:00] the locusts that has multiplied thy
[1:02:02] merchants above the stars of heaven. The
[1:02:04] cankerworm spoileth and flies away.
[1:02:08] Thy crowned, your kings, your nobles,
[1:02:11] your princes, your leaders are as the
[1:02:14] locusts, and thy captains as the great
[1:02:17] grasshoppers which camp in the hedges in
[1:02:19] the cold day. But when the sun arises
[1:02:21] they flee away, and their place is not
[1:02:24] known where they are.
[1:02:27] Thy shepherds slumber, O king of
[1:02:29] Assyria. Thy nobles shall dwell in the
[1:02:32] dust. They'll be slaughtered.
[1:02:35] Thy people is scattered upon the
[1:02:37] mountains, and no man gathers them.
[1:02:40] There are no leaders.
[1:02:43] There is no healing of thy bruise. Thy
[1:02:45] wound is grievous.
[1:02:48] All that hear the brew, the rumor, the
[1:02:50] report, the article of thee shall clap
[1:02:54] their hands over thee. They'll rejoice
[1:02:57] at your calamity. For upon whom hath not
[1:03:00] thy wickedness passed continually.
[1:03:07] Now Bupalasar, king of Babylon, led an
[1:03:10] alliance that besieged Nineveh for three
[1:03:12] months before it fell in 612 BC. Then
[1:03:15] killed its king, ransacked the city.
[1:03:18] Sporadic resistance arose until the
[1:03:20] final suppression in 608 BC.
[1:03:24] During the 1989 and 1990 archaeological
[1:03:27] seasons, the University of California,
[1:03:30] Berkeley, led excavations in the Haly
[1:03:32] Gate, one of those gates in ancient
[1:03:34] Nineveh. They found graphic evidence of
[1:03:37] the final battle of Nineveh. Upwards of
[1:03:40] 16 bodies were excavated in that gate,
[1:03:43] all slain. Archaeological excavations
[1:03:46] have vividly confirmed the words of the
[1:03:50] biblical text.
[1:03:52] Just as Nahm wrote in chapter 1 verse9,
[1:03:56] "What do you imagine against the Lord?
[1:04:00] He will make an utter end. Affliction
[1:04:03] shall not rise up the second time."
[1:04:07] For centuries, even millennia, no one
[1:04:10] knew for certain where Nineveh had been.
[1:04:14] It wasn't until 1853
[1:04:18] that a British adventurer Austin Henry
[1:04:20] Leard lied with a local Calaldian
[1:04:22] Christian Hormuz Rasa. Together they
[1:04:26] began to uncover the remains of Nineveh.
[1:04:29] Buried for some two and a half thousand
[1:04:33] years. The mightiest city of the
[1:04:36] mightiest empire.
[1:04:40] Here's an aerial view. In this image,
[1:04:42] you can see the location of ancient
[1:04:44] Nineveh. The green areas are pastures
[1:04:47] and agricultural and where
[1:04:48] archaeological digs occur. Now, much of
[1:04:51] the area lies under construction of
[1:04:53] apartments and paved streets and like,
[1:04:56] lost and forgotten for 25 centuries.
[1:05:03] Well, let's take a closer look. Neah
[1:05:07] lived in a dark time. A time in which
[1:05:10] the faithful much of must have wondered
[1:05:12] how long would they have to continue to
[1:05:15] resist cultural
[1:05:18] and spiritual compromise.
[1:05:21] Much like today,
[1:05:23] do you ever find your will to do what's
[1:05:25] right weakening or become discouraged
[1:05:29] with what you see?
[1:05:31] The prophet Nahm reminds us of God's
[1:05:34] active hand working even in the darkest
[1:05:36] of times to bring justice and hope
[1:05:39] throughout the world. Nineveh didn't
[1:05:42] fall because it was a large wealthy
[1:05:45] gentile commercial city. It fell because
[1:05:49] it was a godless and idolatrous city. A
[1:05:52] city of violence, lust, and greed. A
[1:05:56] city that had heard the message of God.
[1:05:59] that had experienced his grace and then
[1:06:03] rejected it and returned to its old
[1:06:06] ways, reveling in its own might and
[1:06:08] wealth and power.
[1:06:12] Let's revisit Jonah chapter 3 for a
[1:06:14] moment about a century before Nahm.
[1:06:17] For word of Jonah's dire predictions
[1:06:20] came unto the king of Nineveh and he
[1:06:22] arose from his thrones and he ordered
[1:06:24] Jonah to be cast into prison or tortured
[1:06:27] and killed. No. The king of this mighty
[1:06:31] city, a pagan gentile, perhaps the most
[1:06:35] powerful man on earth at the time, laid
[1:06:37] his robe from him, covered himself with
[1:06:40] sackcloth and sat in ashes.
[1:06:44] This is extreme humility in those days
[1:06:47] as a cultural symbol. He caused it to be
[1:06:50] proclaimed and published throughout
[1:06:52] Nineveh by the decree of the king and
[1:06:55] his nobles, saying, "Let neither man nor
[1:06:57] beast, herd nor flock, taste anything.
[1:07:01] Fast. Let them not feed nor drink water,
[1:07:05] but let man and beast be covered with
[1:07:08] sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God.
[1:07:11] Yay, not God's Jonah's God. Let them
[1:07:15] turn everyone from his evil way.
[1:07:19] Everyone, and from the violence that is
[1:07:23] in their hands.
[1:07:26] Who can tell if God will turn and repent
[1:07:29] and turn away from his fierce anger that
[1:07:31] we perish not?
[1:07:34] And God heard their words. Lord, if
[1:07:37] you'll do this, I'll I promise I'll
[1:07:39] serve you. If you'll just heal me. Lord,
[1:07:41] if no, no, no, no. God saw their works.
[1:07:45] Their works. What we heard this morning.
[1:07:48] God saw their works. He observed their
[1:07:50] actions that they turned. They turned
[1:07:53] from their evil way. And God repented of
[1:07:56] God. Turned from the evil that he had
[1:07:58] said he would do unto them. And he did
[1:08:01] it not.
[1:08:04] But then what happened?
[1:08:06] Isaiah tells us
[1:08:09] in chapter one, he says, "Zion shall be
[1:08:12] redeemed with judgment and her converts
[1:08:15] with righteousness." Her converts
[1:08:19] reminds us of Jonah and Nineveh perhaps.
[1:08:21] However, but however,
[1:08:25] and the destruction of the transgressors
[1:08:28] and of the sinners shall be together,
[1:08:31] and they that forsake the Lord shall be
[1:08:36] consumed. I wonder if he was thinking of
[1:08:38] Nineveh. They that forsake the Lord
[1:08:42] shall be consumed.
[1:08:45] One verse in particular stood out to me
[1:08:47] in the book of Nahm as a warning leading
[1:08:50] to advice that we can all take to heart.
[1:08:53] I can take to heart. Let's turn once
[1:08:56] more to Nahm chapter 1 verse 11.
[1:09:00] There is one come out of thee Nineveh
[1:09:03] that imagines evil against the Lord. A
[1:09:07] wicked counselor.
[1:09:14] The wicked counselor is the king. Within
[1:09:17] 40 years or so after Jonah's ministry to
[1:09:20] Nineveh, Assyria had returned to and
[1:09:22] embraced its former ways. That empire
[1:09:25] conquered Israel and continued its
[1:09:27] expansion, visiting horrific cruelty on
[1:09:30] the inhabitants of its conquered
[1:09:32] territories.
[1:09:34] The result was the utter destruction
[1:09:36] prophesied as we just read in Nahm.
[1:09:42] a wicked counselor.
[1:09:45] Let's turn to Psalm 1, the opening psalm
[1:09:48] of the book of praise and song and
[1:09:51] worship of ancient Israel. The psalm we
[1:09:53] read as part of our opening scriptures
[1:09:56] that speaks of the person who is blessed
[1:09:58] of the Lord.
[1:10:01] Blessed is the man, the person I want to
[1:10:04] be that person. Do you want to be that
[1:10:06] person? How do you become the one that
[1:10:09] is blessed of the Lord that walketh not
[1:10:13] in the counsel of the ungodly?
[1:10:16] A wicked counselor that walketh not in
[1:10:19] the counsel of the ungodly. Rejects
[1:10:21] being influenced by words and
[1:10:24] philosophies that try to draw him or her
[1:10:26] away from the Lord. There's danger
[1:10:29] there. Don't walk in. Walk away.
[1:10:33] nor standeth in the way of sinners.
[1:10:36] Otherwise you may listen, find yourself
[1:10:41] standing submissive, inactive in the
[1:10:44] midst of sin,
[1:10:46] nor siteth in the seat of the scornful.
[1:10:50] The next thing you know, you're sitting
[1:10:51] in the company of the scoffers and your
[1:10:54] words, your counsel joins with theirs,
[1:10:58] influenced and influencing.
[1:11:02] These are three steps that progressively
[1:11:04] draw you away from God's blessings. A a
[1:11:06] path that entices you from him. A siren
[1:11:09] song of destruction.
[1:11:11] Instead of the three do nots, now we're
[1:11:14] told of the do. But his delight is in
[1:11:19] the law of the Lord. And in his law does
[1:11:23] he meditate day and night.
[1:11:27] We sometimes get hooked up by that word
[1:11:29] law. It says really says delight in the
[1:11:33] Torah and Torah means instruction.
[1:11:36] Delight yourself in the instruction of
[1:11:39] the Lord, not a set of rules. It takes
[1:11:42] discipline, brother Daniel, like like
[1:11:45] training to be a boxer. You don't just
[1:11:48] put on the gear, put on the shorts, put
[1:11:50] on the gloves, jump in the ring, and say
[1:11:51] that you're ready. No, it takes
[1:11:54] discipline. It takes training,
[1:11:58] time, effort. You land a few punches and
[1:12:02] you take a few punches. You build
[1:12:04] yourself up. Discipline. I don't want to
[1:12:06] do it. I'm still hurting from that
[1:12:08] bruise yesterday. Get in the ring
[1:12:09] anyway. Training, training, discipline.
[1:12:12] It's hard at first because God requires
[1:12:15] submission to his will, not independence
[1:12:20] from it. Not listening to your body. Oh,
[1:12:23] I'm too tired. I don't want to read the
[1:12:25] Bible this morning. I just need some
[1:12:27] more sleep. But telling your body to
[1:12:30] conform to his word.
[1:12:33] And you only have to do it twice a day.
[1:12:36] When the sun's shining and when it's not
[1:12:40] continually,
[1:12:41] the battle of the mind. And the word
[1:12:44] translated meditate actually means
[1:12:47] muttering, lips moving. Not what we
[1:12:50] might think of as silent meditation,
[1:12:52] sitting quietly and waking up a bit
[1:12:54] later, but reading, pondering with lips
[1:12:57] moving, softly uttering, all our senses
[1:13:00] engaged, focused, discipline, training.
[1:13:07] And he shall he, the one whose delight
[1:13:09] is in the Lord's instruction, who's
[1:13:11] always meditating on it, shall be like a
[1:13:14] tree planted by the rivers of water that
[1:13:16] bringeth forth his fruit in his season.
[1:13:19] His leaf also shall not wither.
[1:13:20] Whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
[1:13:23] In his season, we're talking about
[1:13:25] discipline here, right? It doesn't come
[1:13:28] all at once. You don't plant a seed and
[1:13:29] then the next day go out and harvest
[1:13:31] fruit. No. No, it doesn't come all at
[1:13:35] once. It's not a lightning bolt of
[1:13:37] inspiration and obedience, but over the
[1:13:40] course of time with discipline, growing
[1:13:43] and eventually
[1:13:45] bearing fruit, nurturing that fruit
[1:13:48] until it ripens, ultimately ready for
[1:13:52] harvest for it to be picked.
[1:13:56] The ungodly are not so, but are like the
[1:13:59] chaff which the wind driveth away.
[1:14:03] Think of the threshing floor.
[1:14:06] There's a Hebrew word for wind.
[1:14:10] It's called rua. Well, why do you point
[1:14:13] that out? Because it's also the word for
[1:14:15] spirit. The Holy Spirit, the Holy Rua.
[1:14:20] So, the chaff is blown away by the wind.
[1:14:24] Think of Acts two. The spirit came with
[1:14:26] the sound of a rushing wind. We have a
[1:14:27] choice to be planted and in time bear
[1:14:32] fruit or be blown away as chaff,
[1:14:35] discarded by the wind, discarded by the
[1:14:38] spirit, scattered, of no further use.
[1:14:42] How does it start? With whose counsel
[1:14:46] you listen to, those who you allow to
[1:14:50] influence you.
[1:14:52] Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand
[1:14:55] in the judgment, nor sinners in the
[1:14:57] congregation of the righteous,
[1:15:00] for the Lord knoweth the way of the
[1:15:03] righteous, but the way of the ungodly
[1:15:06] shall perish.
[1:15:09] The musicians would please come. Be
[1:15:12] careful of the voices you listen to, the
[1:15:16] influences you allow in your life. Avoid
[1:15:20] the council of the ungodly.
[1:15:23] Spend time meditating on searching and
[1:15:26] reading and absorbing the words of the
[1:15:29] Bible.
[1:15:31] With that thought and that context,
[1:15:34] let's close this portion of the service,
[1:15:36] pass it back to brother Daniel as we
[1:15:38] worship in song with Psalm 19.
[1:15:42] Before we sing, I want to make a little
[1:15:45] note. And as we sing it, it it talks
[1:15:48] about uh uh the Lord making wise the
[1:15:51] simple. What do you think of when you
[1:15:54] hear that word simple? Lord making wise
[1:15:56] the simple. Does it mean like a
[1:15:59] simpleton or a very uncomplicated person
[1:16:02] or something? No, it doesn't mean
[1:16:04] simple-minded. It means openminded.
[1:16:08] Those willing and able to receive
[1:16:11] instruction.
[1:16:13] James,
[1:16:15] if you lack wisdom, ask for it. But
[1:16:17] you're not going to get it if you're
[1:16:19] unwilling to receive it.
[1:16:22] The word Torah, translated as law, means
[1:16:26] instruction.
[1:16:27] Here's something Brother Brandham said
[1:16:29] about this very topic in this sermon,
[1:16:31] ashamed.
[1:16:33] When you get to a spot, you're so smart,
[1:16:36] you know everything, God can't do
[1:16:38] nothing with you,
[1:16:40] chaff. But if you get to a place that
[1:16:43] you're willing to listen and learn, then
[1:16:46] it's God's time can move in, talk to
[1:16:49] you.
[1:16:51] So with that, if we could stand to our
[1:16:53] feet, please, and sing from the 19th
[1:16:57] Psalm together, a song some 3,000 years
[1:16:59] old, used in worship to our Lord. It was
[1:17:05] truth then, it's truth now.
[1:17:10] The law of the Lord is perfect,
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:15] converting the soul.
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:20] The testimony of the Lord is sure,
[1:17:25] making wise the simple.
[1:17:29] More to be desired are they than gold,
[1:17:34] yay, than much fine gold.
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:39] Sweeter also than honey,
[1:17:43] and the honey cold.
[1:17:48] The statutes of the Lord are right,
[1:17:53] rejoicing the heart.
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:17:57] The commandment of the Lord is pure,
[1:18:03] enlightening the eyes.
[1:18:07] More to be desired are they than gold,
[1:18:12] yay, than much fine gold,
[1:18:16] sweeter also than honey.
[1:18:21] and the honeycomb.
[1:18:26] The fear of the Lord is clean,
[1:18:31] enduring forever.
[1:18:35] The judgments of the Lord are true
[1:18:40] and righteous allto together.
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:44] More to be desired are they than gold,
[1:18:49] yay, than much fine gold.
[1:18:54] Sweeter also than honey,
[1:18:58] and the honeycomb.
[1:19:03] Moreover, by them is thy servant warned,
[1:19:08] is thy servant warn.
[1:19:12] Moreover, by them
[1:19:17] is thy servant warn.
[1:19:22] And in keeping of them there is great
[1:19:25] reward. There is great reward.
[1:19:31] And in keeping of heaven
[1:19:36] there is great reward. Amen.
[1:19:40] You know, how many times have I read the
[1:19:42] book of Naam? And it's been at least um
[1:19:47] I've read my Bible all the way through,
[1:19:48] I don't know, eight or nine times. So,
[1:19:50] it's been at least eight or nine times.
[1:19:52] And
[1:19:54] to have all of these different pieces of
[1:19:57] the puzzle come in to come in like
[1:20:00] brother Lyall brought them in together
[1:20:02] with Jonah and with with the Psalms and
[1:20:04] with with Isaiah. It made sense.
[1:20:08] It made sense. And I thank God that we
[1:20:12] can open this Bible. And our Bible
[1:20:14] study, usually we're on Wednesday night,
[1:20:16] but our Bible study, it opens up the
[1:20:19] book to where we know what's going on.
[1:20:22] You know, it doesn't always have to be a
[1:20:24] big spiritual application, although I
[1:20:26] did appreciate many of the things
[1:20:28] Brother Lyle said today and applying
[1:20:29] this to our lives. But it's also very
[1:20:33] important that we understand the book,
[1:20:36] that we understand what's going on. And
[1:20:39] then we can appreciate it more. We can
[1:20:41] appreciate these prophets that
[1:20:42] prophesied. These prophets like brother
[1:20:45] Lao put up there that on the screen,
[1:20:48] these death spots that we have today
[1:20:50] with like like from Russia and and and
[1:20:53] North Korea and and China and Iran.
[1:20:57] These prophets, they went right up in
[1:20:58] their face. God was with them and they
[1:21:01] prophesied
[1:21:02] and God honored their prophecy. Does it
[1:21:04] feel good? Feels good to understand this
[1:21:07] book. Brother null, I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:21:09] have you come up just one more time
[1:21:12] before you you you go home and and
[1:21:14] close. Brother Jocidiety of a song.
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:25] down from his glory.
[1:21:31] Ever living
[1:21:33] story.
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:37] My God and Savior came
[1:21:43] and Jesus was his name.
[1:21:48] Bored in a manger
[1:21:54] to his own a strangeanger.
[1:21:59] A man of sorrows, tears,
[1:22:05] agony.
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:10] Oh, how I love him.
[1:22:15] How I adore
[1:22:18] him.
[1:22:20] My breath, my sunshine,
[1:22:26] my all.
[1:22:31] The great creatator
[1:22:36] became my savior
[1:22:41] and all God's holiness
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:46] dwelling
[1:22:48] in him.
[1:22:55] As I was listening to my brother and
[1:22:57] expounding on Nahm,
[1:23:00] they ministered on on Habacook,
[1:23:05] what he describes about Nahm, Habacook
[1:23:07] was living in that same time frame.
[1:23:11] And what Habacook was fearful of was
[1:23:15] when Assyria invaded Judah
[1:23:18] that he was afraid they were going to
[1:23:20] level the place.
[1:23:22] And but God had other things in mind.
[1:23:24] And God raised up the Babylon
[1:23:26] Babylonians to fight Assyria to fight.
[1:23:29] Yeah. To fight Nineveh.
[1:23:32] But the thing that like if I can go back
[1:23:34] to what I said on with with with
[1:23:36] Habacook,
[1:23:38] Habacook was afraid that when the
[1:23:40] invasion came, he was going to lose his
[1:23:42] life.
[1:23:44] God told him, "If you will put absolute
[1:23:47] trust in me, I will take care of you.
[1:23:53] That has been my theme. That has been my
[1:23:56] desire. That has been my revelation ever
[1:23:58] since I studied at least I studied
[1:24:00] Habacook.
[1:24:02] And what and I don't know what tomorrow
[1:24:04] will bring. Nobody does. We have a new
[1:24:06] president. I wish him luck.
[1:24:09] But we don't know what tomorrow will
[1:24:11] bring.
[1:24:12] Amen.
[1:24:12] Um
[1:24:14] all I know is he holds my tomorrows.
[1:24:18] And if I can take and put my absolute
[1:24:21] faith and trust in him,
[1:24:24] then I then I'm assured that he will
[1:24:28] take care of me.
[1:24:30] Amen.
[1:24:31] And that it's in that that I rest. I
[1:24:32] don't rest in the government. They could
[1:24:35] change that all tomorrow. I mean, who
[1:24:37] knows what's going to happen.
[1:24:40] I mean, the future is an unknown, a huge
[1:24:44] unknown,
[1:24:45] but God is a known. Yes.
[1:24:48] I mean, I think it was Habacook in the
[1:24:50] last part of it. He says, "You'll make
[1:24:52] my feet like Hines's feet." Basically,
[1:24:54] he says, "You're going to make me I have
[1:24:55] a sure footing so that as I proceed
[1:24:57] through my life, you will make sure that
[1:24:59] my footing is secure and steadfast. You
[1:25:02] will make it so I will not vary to the
[1:25:04] right or the left. You'll make sure that
[1:25:05] I I will always remain in your care. I
[1:25:07] will always remain where you are
[1:25:09] watching over me and guiding me and
[1:25:11] protect me. And you will make my feet my
[1:25:14] you will make my path sure." And that's
[1:25:17] like I say when I look at this and and
[1:25:19] then when you begin when you begin to
[1:25:21] realize like I say the hour in which
[1:25:23] we're living
[1:25:25] who do we trust?
[1:25:27] I mean that's the question I had to ask
[1:25:29] of myself. And whom do I trust?
[1:25:32] It isn't a matter of trying to believe
[1:25:34] for healing or believe for this or
[1:25:36] believe for that. No, it's having
[1:25:37] absolute faith and trust in the one who
[1:25:40] has called us. It it's like I I I
[1:25:42] mentioned I don't know if I mentioned it
[1:25:44] here, but do you realize when you
[1:25:46] receive the Holy Ghost, do you
[1:25:48] understand what is now dwelling inside
[1:25:49] of you?
[1:25:51] Amen. That's a good thing.
[1:25:52] You have you it's it's it's the the Holy
[1:25:55] Spirit is the essence of everything God
[1:25:57] is. God is not three people. We talk
[1:26:00] about three different dispensations.
[1:26:02] That God changes his his mask, if you
[1:26:04] will, from one dispensation to another
[1:26:06] to another, but it's still the same God.
[1:26:10] And that all eternal, allsufficient, all
[1:26:12] powerful, all self-existing one, the
[1:26:15] essence of everything God is is what
[1:26:18] dwells in you once you receive him into
[1:26:21] your heart.
[1:26:23] Let's just pray.
[1:26:26] Heavenly Father, I am reminded
[1:26:30] of the way that you have promised us.
[1:26:32] You have to we you say of you we you
[1:26:34] dwell in me and I will dwell in you and
[1:26:36] then ask what you will and God will
[1:26:38] provide. But there has to be a dwelling
[1:26:40] within you and you also a dwelling
[1:26:42] within us. Until Lord re we reliterally
[1:26:46] become one and the same where you so
[1:26:49] dwell in us and you take possession of
[1:26:50] our vessels until Lord it's no longer I
[1:26:52] who live but now it's Christ living his
[1:26:54] life out through me. And then Lord we
[1:26:57] realize that you are the allsufficient
[1:26:59] all powerful self-existing one. And you
[1:27:02] that the one the essence of everything
[1:27:04] you are dwells inside of us. And Lord,
[1:27:07] it's in that that we that it's in you
[1:27:09] that we trust. It's in you that we trust
[1:27:12] for the tomorrows. It's in you that we
[1:27:14] trust for the for our future. Because
[1:27:16] Lord, you're the only thing that is
[1:27:18] stable. And you're the only thing, Lord,
[1:27:20] that has the power to see us through
[1:27:22] that which is coming. So be with us,
[1:27:24] Lord. Be as as a group. And we we're
[1:27:26] singing the song, Lord. Let your let let
[1:27:29] your life be manifested in the church.
[1:27:32] The church is is your body. And Lord, we
[1:27:35] are part of that body. So Lord, let your
[1:27:38] life come and so dwell in us until Lord,
[1:27:41] you can live your life out through us.
[1:27:44] And Lord, we can declare your presence
[1:27:46] and your love and your joy and your
[1:27:47] mercy unto the surrounding community in
[1:27:50] which we live. Because Lord, the only
[1:27:52] God they will see is as you as we allow
[1:27:56] you to express your life through us. So
[1:27:59] be with us, Lord. come and so dwell in
[1:28:01] us, Lord, until we just move out of
[1:28:03] side. And Lord, now it's no longer I who
[1:28:06] live, but now it's you who live inside
[1:28:07] of us. Grant this, Lord, for I'm asking
[1:28:10] it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:28:13] Amen.
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:17] What a day
[1:28:20] that will be
[1:28:22] when my Jesus
[1:28:25] I shall see.
[1:28:28] When I look upon his face, the one who
[1:28:33] saved me by his grace.
[1:28:37] He takes me by the hand and leads me
[1:28:42] through the promised land.
[1:28:46] What a day.
[1:28:48] Glorious day
[1:28:51] that will be. Amen. It's going to be a
[1:28:55] glorious day. I think uh these two
[1:28:58] Johnson boys make a good team. What do
[1:29:01] you think? I asked brother asked brother
[1:29:03] null. I said give us say a few words
[1:29:05] before you leave. Brother and sister,
[1:29:07] we're going to miss you. It was good
[1:29:09] having you sojouring with us and it was
[1:29:12] it was good that you shared some of your
[1:29:14] wisdom and the scriptures with us. We
[1:29:16] appreciate you. We love you and we look
[1:29:19] forward to you coming back. God bless
[1:29:21] you, brother and sister Noah Johnson.
[1:29:24] Love you. God bless you.
[1:29:26] [Applause]
