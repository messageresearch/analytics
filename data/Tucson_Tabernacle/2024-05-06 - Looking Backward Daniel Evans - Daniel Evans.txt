in our Bibles brothers and sisters the Philippians the 3D [Music] chapter verse number 11 [Music] the Apostle Paul says this he says if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended he's saying that I have I don't have it yet but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things that are before I press toward the M the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God amen in Christ Jesus amen thank you you can take your [Music] seats brother Josiah said he said we should never neglect to worship our Lord sister it's good to see you here brother Tony's mom God bless you good to see you again and the visitors always welcome see you back there God bless you and I see somebody with the fry host here God bless you sis it's good to have you here welcome to to everyone um brother Josiah mention that we should never neglect our worship and and to take take that time to Worship the Lord and we on our Wednesday night bible study we were talking about job and and job how he lost his livelihood he lost his job he lost all of his money he lost all of his wealth and then he lost all 10 of his children all died in one one great catastrophe and job here he is and he's he's he's just beaten down to death and what does he do he gets down on his knees and he worships I think that's what we need to do more of we we we can't as brother Josiah said we can't do it enough he is so great and and the more that we worship Him the closer that we will get to him I was yesterday I was praying about the direction that the Lord wants me to go I've been working obviously you work all week and and you're trying to find the Lord's will you're trying to you're studying and and you're trying to find the direction that he wants you to go and so yesterday I wanted to get away so there's a a place up in the catalinas that that I hike up to it's it's like for it's about a Four mile hike one way so it's a roundtrip it's about seven or eight miles and it's just it's so private up there and I was walking up to the place that I go to pray and and I feel like it's it's hard for me I don't know if it's hard for you but it sometimes it's hard for me to really enter into prayer right away like right when I get on my knees and pray sometimes the Lord's just right there but most of the time it takes it takes takes time to to get my mind calmed down and and that's why coming to church early it helps you it helps us get into that spirit before we get here and then we're ready to receive and we're ready to worship as the worship leader is up there then we can it's easier to enter in and we're not just scattered and and and trying to trying to get our minds right and and I was walking up the mountain up this little Trail going up and just wanting to get out all of my thoughts before I came before the Lord in prayer and and I was walking up and I was praying and I was thinking and and going through the the different things that were in my mind and I started noticing that how much this trail that i' I go up and I've been going going up there for years and years how much it changes all the time I'm going up this trail and I noticed that this time a year there's a lot of there's a lot of grass growing there's a a little creek that's running and and as I'm going up I'm thinking Lord that you created all of this this beautiful creation these great Catalina mountains 9,000 ft tall and and there's pine trees up at the top and and down where I was there was Oak trees and juniper trees and and just thinking of how much variety God has and thinking that as I'm on my way up there Lord I'm going to talk to you I'm going to talk to the almighty God I I want to I want to have a conversation with you and it's the greatest thing that we could ever do is have this conversation with god can you imagine actually talking to him stand on our knees or whatever it is and and speaking to him and then having him speak back to us what as I was going up I was thinking on those things and I was thinking lord it's my greatest desire in life it is everything to me if I could just do one thing it would be to talk to you and have you speak back I know that we've been mankind has been been trying to do that for 6,000 years and he does speak back to us as I was on my way up thinking about job and and how job's comforters so-called comforters we we talked about this on Wednesday night they were his friends and they were really hard on him but they didn't really care what job said job was going through all these hard times and and they came and and they would hear him out but they just were waiting to talk they wanted to get their words in and they didn't really care what what job had to say and then after all of this happened this dialogue between job and these and these these friends of his back and forth and justifying themselves and condemning job for sinning secretly because he must have sinned because all of this bad stuff happened to him so they were condemning him job said I don't know what's going on on they're back and forth and then at the very end God speaks and isn't that like the nature of God we talk and we talk and we talk all the time and sometimes it's nice just to have somebody to listen to us things are hard in life a real friend sometimes that just sits there and and listens and says what can I do for you and that's how God does so much we talk and we pour out our heart to him he just listens and he listens he's so kind he's so loving and I was as I was going up there I was talking and and praying and I was and I said Lord look at this beautiful Creek coming across this this big crass and and look at these oak trees that are growing here and and look at the grass and and everything changes so much in nature it's so Dynamic it's always Reviving him itself it it goes from to summer when it's just dry and then the monsoons hit and you see the cactus they start to swell up everything changes all a sudden everything's green and then it goes from from time to time always changing and that's how God is he's always he doesn't change but our environment around God changes and the times change he likes variety and as I was going up there thinking about how our testimonies should be like nature it should never be stale every it should always be fresh and we should always be revived and we should never brothers and sisters we should never be able to look back on our lives and see that I was closer to God at another time than I am right now we should always be the closest to God that we've ever been right now and we should never also we should never be looking behind us we should never be looking in the past so so often I see so many of the brothers and sisters they struggle with past sins that they've had and they look back at these sins and and they just can't get past them don't don't you know when you're looking at these past sins when you're looking in the past that you are sinning that is a sin because you're denying the very power of the blood of Jesus Christ when you do that and I know it's hard for some people people have different personalities and some people just can't get over their mistakes but you have to have more faith in that and you can't doubt the blood of Christ Don't Look Back always look forward God as I said is constantly renewing he's he's constantly renewing nature he's constantly renewing life that you'll see a cycle of Life I'll go up there and all of a sudden there's a there's a new tree growing that I didn't notice or there's new animals that that I've never seen before and it's always something fresh and it's always something new and that should be the life of a Christ Christian it shouldn't be looking back and trying to create a world that's time past it should be now and here and this is a Revival that's coming forth out of me that should be us all the time let's turn in the Book of John chapter 7 verse 37 it says this Jesus speaking or in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and to drink you noce Jesus he wants that relationship he doesn't want it just once he doesn't want you to just come to the Lord Jesus and then you get changed and then he steps back and you never come to him again when we drink drink if I take a a drink of of water when I'm thirsty it's refreshing and it feels good but later on I'm going to thirst again when you're out working in in the Sun and and you get hot and and you get dehydrated and you take that water and it feels so good and you drink it and oh it's just so refreshing and then you go back to work but you're going to get thirsty again so you got to go back to the well and drink again again and that's how it is with Jesus Christ you don't just come to him once and come to the Altar and make a change in your life it is a constant refilling you're thirsty all the time you want more and more and you take a big drink and you just feel so good but it's okay to get thirsty again that's all right and then you come back to that well and you you want more and you get more he wants that relationship all the time verse 38 he that believeth on me the Lord Jesus talking as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water he's not saying that these rivers of Living Water are flowing from him he's not saying that these rivers of Living Water in this verse he's not saying that they're coming out of Jesus Christ Christ he's saying that if you come to me and if you believe me then these rivers of Living Water these rivers of water will be coming out of you and we we don't think that we're always thinking that it's going to be Jesus but Jesus pours these Waters into us and then those water come that water comes out and it's like in the desert right now look and it's just there's just so much life and it's because there's water there and it's not a drip Jesus isn't talking about a drip or a little trickle or a Sprinkle he's saying rivers of water will flow out of you if you believe on me not pointing to someone else but it's coming out of that Christian but this spaky listen to this but this spake he of the spirit which they believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so this is a prophecy that Jesus is saying he said that if you believe on me you're going to receive this Holy Spirit and then this River of water is going to flow out of you and then there's going to be others that come and drink of it amen out of you we've read in the book of Acts and we've seen these great Servants of the Lord over the years we've seen it in in more recently in William brandom and how he had the power of the Holy Ghost that was represented in his life where people came from all over the world to come to his meetings to not only hear him preach but to be prayed for documented cases of famous people a a man that had been crippled paralyzed for most of his life a congressman named William Upshaw Upshaw came to the service he was called out sitting there and healed completely restored to where he he could walk again coming and receiving that water that was being being ped poured out another woman Florence Nightingale you've read the story she was dying of cancer she was this close to death got a hold of brother Brandon when he was in when he got into England and they came to the airport they got him he went there prayed for her and she was completely made well that water just flowed out of him my grandpa bitten by a rattlesnake this comes right home here he told me bitten by a rattlesnake suffering there was prayed for and was healed close friends of our family came and were healed of cancer and and awful things I think merily I think even Rod's mom was healed of cancer if I remember right and one of brother brandom's meetings the river of water was flowing out of this man and people came to drink in Hebrews 11 we hear of the faith of Abel and and the the proper sacrifice that he had in Enoch who was raptured and Noah who built this Ark by faith in Abraham and Sarah who claimed even at 90 years old the promise of God that they were going to have children claimed it it was given to them old far beyond that and yet by faith they accepted it and they were given children given a child Moses by faith refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter these great warriors of Faith they had it in Living Waters came out of it Hebrews chapter 11 let's read just the last part of it verse 31 by faith Rahab the the Harlot Rahab perish not with them that believe not when she received the spies with peace and what more shall I say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and of Samson and of jeepa and of David also and Samuel and all the prophets if you were coming to our Wednesday night bible studies you'd know who every one of those were amen who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness they were made strong they waxed Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of crew mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawed aunder they were sawed in half they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goatskins being destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us wow digest that for a minute God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness lay aside every weight and the sin which doth easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us live this life run this race do your best looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen Jesus Christ is the author and finisher of our faith and if we believe him then the rivers of water brothers and sisters would flow from us through the power of His holy spirit FL from us like they did these people I just read about but we always try to live in a different time we always try to live in the past we try to recreate something that has already been passed and we are ignoring the prophecies that are fresh and that are applied to this day and they're not moving backwards these prophecies are for us again in John 7:38 he said he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly out of his belly out of this person shall flow rivers of Living Water and prophesying of what was going to happen at the day of Pentecost when 120 were filled with the with the Holy Spirit and then they set the precedent for everyone after that to be filled with that same Holy Spirit but instead brothers and sisters instead of us re having that living water and giving that living water out we point to something be in the past we're always pointing backwards and and and showing people that but ignoring this person right here and say this is the man this is the woman that has this Holy Spirit but we want to point backwards to a different day Joshua didn't try to be Moses when he crossed over Jordan he didn't try to bring the law he conquered that Promised Land he remembered what had happened but he went forward in a different generation than Moses did when I was when I was up on the mountain praying yesterday was asking the Lord then I finally got up to my place and I was praying and trying to get quiet before the Lord and seeking what his will was and asking him Lord do you want me to minister on this this subject of Looking Backward because it's an awful thing always looking back how many times have we heard that man his nature is to look back at what God did before and look forward to what God's going to do but ignoring what's going on right now wow and that is the biggest problem we we look back all the time we look we look at all the healings and all the Miracles and all that that was yesterday we live in today we remember that we learn from that we honor the word we apply the word to our lives but we live in this day and there are promises to come we look forward to those but right now wow and as I was praying on that and studying not studying but as I was praying and and sitting on that rock and asking the Lord Lord do you want me to say this to the church do you want me to go in a different direction I don't know Lord I don't know what to do I just I just want your will then as usual with most of us I got up and Lord I think I'm going in the right direction I I want to I didn't maybe get an answer like I've gotten a couple times in my life so I uh I said well I'm going to listen to a sermon on my way home which I usually do I usually try to get quiet before the Lord as I walk up there and then I spend an hour or however long I'm up there praying and then on the way back down I like to listen to a sermon or listen to my Bible on the way home with my earbuds so I've been wanting to hear a sermon titled who is this mzc I've I've heard it many times before but I wanted to kind of refresh my memory and and listen to it again so I got on my phone and I uh I started I looked I picked it out and I went to play it and it said would you like to download it's like man I've heard this sermon before I don't know why it wants me to download it should already be in my memory so I hit yes and it downloaded a sermon and then it started playing a different sermon I thought okay well here's one of those things I know this sounds small but Lord do you want me to hear this other sermon amen or do you want me to or is this just the devil fighting me from looking listen to this one yeah aren't we just so messed up in our minds we're just sometimes we're just kids sometimes I am it's like Lord I don't know what to do I don't know this sermon that sermon and I was that a impass I didn't know what to do so I stood there for a minute and I'm sitting on this rock and it's just beautiful out across this Valley and I'm thinking Lord this is so wonderful what do you want me to do I said okay I'll just listen to the one that downloaded so I started listening to that one and asking the Lord Lord do you want me to talk do you want me to encourage or discourage the people from constantly looking back so I turned it on and it wasn't one or two minutes and this quote came up said this I would have loved to live in that day speaking of the Lord Jesus and his disciples I would have loved to live in that day to follow him but you know I'm glad I still have the privilege of doing the same thing watching him do things and it's a greater it's greater to watch him today than it was then I have more faith in him now and can have more faith now than I could have then because we've had 2,000 years to prove that the gospel is right and after 2,000 years he's still alive am he is Jesus Christ is alive he's still alive and doing just as he did then so we have a greater assurance and more foundation for Faith now than they had then what I just read in Hebrews this is greater than it was even then so brothers and sisters we are not to live in the past even if it's 50 years years ago we are to live in the now and these rivers of water should be flowing from us not William brandham or Billy Paul brandom or Perry green or or any of us not Martin Luther not John the Baptist not Moses not Elijah they should be flowing from us but a sectarian Spirit we often call it denominational spirit will always influence us to live in another day it'll try to create something that a past world what we do is we try to create a world and live in the past it always happens that way and then we want to look like they looked we want to talk like they talked we want to act like they acted back then and forsake and forget about living today listen to this Ecclesiastes 7: 10 if you could put the King James version up there I'm going to read the English Standard Version it says say not why were the former days better than these for it is not from the wisdom that you ask this don't say that it's these past days don't say why was that better than it is now because that is not wisdom leading you in asking that question wow it's so easy to say that I wished I would have lived in Moses's day or I wish I would lived in the prophet's day or I wish I would have lived in the the early Revival of the early 1900s or in 70 years ago but that is not wisdom that causes you to say that and it's not God that's putting that in your mind w we don't go back to that we should be focused on today and not a hundred years ago or not 2,000 years ago we see that when revivals rise up that often times a sect or a group or a denomination forms from those revivals and then the spirit dies right there there's um back in the 1500s this man named Martin Luther rose up a Revival rose up among the people and it started this Protestant Revolution this Protestant Revival where they came against the church and and and said that there's certain things Martin Luther wrote 95 of them these 95 things don't line up with the word and he stood up against it and it started this great movement that we still see see today and from that movement there was a group of people that rose up they're called the anabaptist I'm going to give a little history lesson and what the anabaptists are is they said that you need to there needs to be a personal um conviction before you're baptized there needs to be a repentance there you need to say that I want to be baptized the Lord has to do a work in your life before you're baptized instead of infant baptism when a child can't um a child can't uh can't repent a child you're just basically getting the kid wet it doesn't do any good but when there is a real repentance there saying that Lord I'm sorry I want to change I want to show everybody up in this baptismal that I am a different person that's what started right then and then it moved into different divisions and they started like people do splitting and fighting and doing what they did there was this man named menos Simons I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name right he was he started the menite church and they were more conservative group they they were anabaptist they said that you had to have a confession of Faith before you were baptized and a a very conservative group and they go along and then there was this other man named Jacob Ammon again I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name right it's German Swiss names and he started the Amish faith that came from the menite faith and what his deal was and what their deal was is you're not being conservative enough you're not you're you're being too worldly the menites you guys are being too worldly you're dressing too worldly you need to start when the people start to stray you need to start shunning them you need to start kicking them out of church if they're not looking and acting like we are you need to start dividing you need to start separating so then this Amish group gets started and when they did this brothers and sisters they may have been great men but when they did this that Revival died and then it was just Traditions after that as I said there was no more rivers of living water flowing from these people now it just became a denomination it just became a group of people remember what I said God is a god of variety as nature and just nature itself teaches you that you see there's oak trees and and there was so pretty there's oos and then there's these little flowers forming on the end of them just beautiful variety of of of nature that's what God wants but when we start looking back then we want everyone to be a clone of ourselves we want everyone to look the same and that's the spirit that this Amish Church started and I know nobody talks bad about the Amish people because they're so sweet and conservative and all this I hate to say this but they're not a threat there's no Amish converts they just make more Amish is what they do uh naturally but there's there's there's not there's not a nobody wants to be omish and it's because what do they have to offer they're Looking Backward yes they're more moral I I see that in certain things but they've isolated themselves so much that the part that Jesus said that go into all the world and make disciples there is none of that because it's dead because they've organized and they've made everyone to look the same so I was talking with a friend of mine a few years ago Amish guy and he was uh he was telling me we were talking about religion which we we enjoyed doing and he was telling me that he said that the Amish they're not a denomination he said that the Amish is a way of life and I just I didn't I didn't it didn't set well with me and I said I said well I said I I disagree I think it is a denomination I think I think you are a sectarian group with certain beliefs that you go back to the that you are getting from your group that don't necessarily go with the Bible and he's like no he says this is our we choose this way of living we like this way of living and I said answer this question for me I said if one of the boys in your um Community if he came out with a baseball cap rather than a straw hat I said what would you do and he said well we were corrected and I said correct what and he says well the Amish way is to wear a hat and I said when you were correcting him would you invoke the name of God and he said well yeah I said no brother I said you are you're very much a denomination like the Catholic or the Baptist or whatever it is it's not just a way of life it is your religion and he and I told him I said do you think that wearing those clothes and I always admired the Amish I I like their way and I like their their um dedication to their faith but I don't think wearing a straw hat instead of a baseball cap makes you more of a Believer it has nothing to do with Holiness it's just wearing black clothes and a black hat m is not brushing your teeth not having electricity doesn't make you more holy it's a relationship with God that makes you more holy Holiness is very important but Holiness comes from a relationship with Christ I think I also told him I said I said brother I said if if what you're saying is true and and he was what he what they're doing is they trying to go back to the 15 and 1600s and they're trying to dress like that like I said they're trying to go back and trying to create this this community that was hundreds and hundreds of years ago and I said brother I said if you want to do it right you need to go all the way back to the Garden of Eden and wear animal skins like God himself made for his people I said the the blue shirt and the the Hat that's that's that's modern as far as as time goes well the most important thing brothers and sisters is to receive that Holy Spirit and then he will tell you he will show you things to wear not look back and try to create a group of people that all look the same that doesn't work he'll show you what to wear I hear preachers preaching against television all the time in a length of a of of the women's sleeves and the women's dress and and talking about something that was 50 or 60 years ago and now we have social media that destroys people that has destroyed a whole generation of people people constantly looking on this thing and doing this all day day long time that would have been spent with their families or spent reading their Bibles or spent praying and we don't say that because we're stuck 50 60 70 years ago about a dumb television there's so much worse today and that's what needs to be preached but if we're trying to create a community like the Amish then we ignore what's going on wow that time was once spent in in prayer now it's on Tik Tok and YouTube and Facebook they say I only I only look at religious stuff first of all it's not true but second you're being influenced by a spirit who put that what you're watching to together you don't know who did that and it's getting your mind off of the word and onto something that you have no idea where it came from brother brandham said and and I'm not I understand brother brandham said that television could be used for the Lord I feel the same about social media it could be but it's not and again we're trying to create a world preaching against things that just don't have relevance today there are things that do have relevance you know I I there's a sect of people that they won't darken the door of a church because they don't play a tape yet they'll spend hours on a day surfing on their phones their kids are hooked up to pornography and spending countless times on social social media out driving around streaming a sermon rather than making the effort to come to church creating a generation brother I'm not not just talking about this I'm talking about the whole world that can't focus that needs constant entertainment and and constantly a constantly feed of dopamine and and on their post and see how many how many likes they get and how many views they get I know people that won't and you do too that won't go to a church function because it's too worldly yet they'll put their kids in the University have you ever been on a University campus but they'll refuse to go to a church function because they're not dressed right walk around Park Avenue where you put your kids in school I'm not saying going to school is wrong don't don't get me don't get me wrong there but I'm saying come on you're trying to live in a day that's gone past and there is much more today that's against us that's fighting us and we need to be aware of these things and we're still preaching about dress and televisions it's ridiculous every Revival starts with people getting away from looking behind them and turning their eyes back to this book and then seeing the word manifest itself in their day if they get this living water of Jesus Christ they'll know how to dress if they get this living water of Jesus Christ they'll know how to talk they'll know what to study they'll know what to put their time and effort into they'll know if they can just get to Christ but instead we condemn them from wearing a baseball cap instead of a straw hat we don't but it's just the same and it doesn't do any good never has done any good Holiness is important but it is not what defines you what defines us should be the Living Water of the holy spirit being poured out from us to the world and then watching Life Spring up that is what should Define us as a body of Christians of genuine Believers let's go to um Isaiah chapter 43 Verse 15 I am the Lord your Holy One the creator of Israel your king thus saeth the Lord which maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty Waters which bringeth forth The Chariot and the horse the Army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as a toe remember ye not the former things consider the things of old neither consider the things of old but I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert God's warning the people don't get stuck in a Time past remember those things but if you try to live in a past time it's going to introduce sin it will bring sin into your life it'll bring sin into your family if you're trying to live in an age that's not here it'll throw out holiness that's why the Pharisees and Sadducees They didn't accept Jesus because he didn't come in the way that they thought he should but are we brothers and sisters am I satisfied with my religion like the yashar are we satisfied with Looking Backward to the Mighty Warriors of faith that were before us or do we want those rivers of water to flow from us so that others can come and drink what what what is it are we satisfied am I satisfied with my walk with the Lord I'm not I'm going to read a testimony from a brother who wasn't either we know him as the Apostle Paul Philippians chapter 3:1 says this if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either we're made perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that which also I am apprehended of Jesus Christ the English Standard Version says this not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect but I press on to make it my own because Jesus Christ has made me his own amen Brethren I count not myself to have app HED I'm not saying that I have it yet this is the Apostle Paul speaking but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind it could be past sins brothers and sisters it could be things that we've done wrong it could be mistakes that we've made I wish I would have done this I wish I wish that that I just would have gone this direction instead of that direction and also trying to create a world from a hundred years ago forget those things which are behind and reach forth unto those things which are before Paul is saying that he is straining forward to what lies ahead and he's not looking at things that are in the past I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything be ye otherwise minded God shall reveal this unto you nevertheless where to we have already attained let us walk by the same Rule and let us mind the same thing I'll read those last two verses in the English Standard Version it says this let those of us who are mature think this way and if anything you and if anything you think otherwise God will reveal that also to you only let us hold true that that which we have attained he's saying to keep pressing forward and asking God for more but don't throw away all the progress that you've already made either build upon it but don't stop and look back hoping for things that are in the past those things are in the past and let All Things become new Jesus said he said God is the god of the living he's not the god of the dead and that's the whole thing with God he's alive and he's moving and everything is new and fresh and that's the way that our gospel should be that's the way the pulpit should be everything should be new fresh but taken from the Eternal Word it's this isn't old this is eternal it's always true but more and more things are revealed to us every day and new things apply to our lives brother brandom [Music] came and he started a wonderful thing there was a great Revival that happened in the 40s and 50s and 60s changed the world and we see people that came from that Revival we see all these charismatic ministers and you know what they did they tried to be him they started doing the discernment wrong sometimes when people would come he preached in this very church when people would come before him it was always perfect he said your name is this you've done this go and be healed in the name of Jesus there's so many of us here that are related to people that received their healing that received their salvation through that gift but then other people went and they tried to copy it they tried to live in another age and we see it today and there are many many deceivers out there trying to do the same thing you can watch them not on television but you can watch them on YouTube and it's it's an impersonation trying to live in a Time past that gift of discernment is there it's always been there it was there with Peter with Anan and saf it was there with um Elijah or Elisha um when uh gesia the servant took the garments from the U the one that was healed in the Jordan River it's there and it operates I've seen it I've seen it in my own Ministry it's not my gift it's not the thing that I do but I've seen it operate even in me I'm not saying that it's not right I'm saying that it's there but so people they try to copy it and they'll say things like oh there's somebody here that has a back problem you're really suffering sister it's like yeah it's easy to do but the specifics the names the exact things the doctor said the addresses those things are are not imperson that you can't impersonate them it happened but we don't want to go back and try to recreate that let the gift let the Lord operate and like I said if we if we try to live in a different hour brothers and sisters it'll bring sin I remember bowling alleys you know they were taboo when I was a kid because because I'd heard on on some of the sermons that that these things were wrong so I would never darken the door of a bowling bowling alley but I want I'd go to the clubs that's how you start thinking that's the that's the rule of thought when you start doing that doesn't make sense and with the Amish it didn't make sense and what it does is it brings in sin when we try to create a world that's behind us and I'm not saying don't please don't say that I'm saying saying anything about Holiness it will produce more Holiness yes the holy spirit in you will produce a better person than an Amish person that tries to live 400 years ago you will be because you are free you are open to whatever the Lord wants for you to do and then the musicians can come and then Brothers and sisters what Jesus said that that great promise that he made out of you will flow rivers of Living Water I look and is it flowing from us think about you personally are these rivers of Living Water are they flowing from you I can't Define it I don't know exactly what it means and neither does anyone else but it is I do know what it means it's the Holy Spirit operating in The Believer and others come to drink others come to be delivered others come to be healed others come to be comforted others come to drink of that water is it happening it needs to happen imagine the spirit of God coming down and dwelling into a in a person and that same Jesus Christ that we read about so much that same Jesus Christ operating in the people like it did in the book of Acts those things that is God's nature that's how he operates I talk about the times change God doesn't change his nature stays the same He Is A Healer he is a comforter he is a deliverer he always has been and he always will be and he uses his people to do it now are there rivers of Living Water and brothers and sisters we need to seek that is there something within me that wants to be closer to God is there something within me Lord if I could just talk to you if I could just know your will Lord if I could just know your will for my life help me and it's not wear about wearing a baseball cap or a straw hat it's about receiving the very Spirit of Christ into our lives and not brothers and sisters not looking back to a day that's gone and trying to mimic it whether it be Amish or whether it be us or whether it be whatever it is don't try to recreate that world in your life go to Christ and let his Holiness just flow through you then you will love God then you will be that Fountain that's flowing forth that that people come to water brother [Music] Josiah take up your cross and follow Jesus [Music] take up your cross and follow Jesus take up your cross each and every day don't be ashamed to say that you know him count up the cost take up your cross and follow him o take up

is good God loves us and brothers and sisters he wants a a dynamic relationship with us he wants he wants life to be coming forward all the time he doesn't want us always looking as I said looking in the rear ofie mirror and looking what God did before and thinking about what he's going to do and getting all of the the prophecies lined up in our minds and this is how it's going to be it never happens the way that people are going to think it's going to be it never does I can't think of one instance where it did it's always a surprise and that's how God is he loves us and he wants wants life flowing all the time from us he wants this water just bubbling up he wants change in his people he wants them to get closer to him he wants that relationship brothers and sisters brother Josiah you sang that song um at the beginning that oh it was beautiful um he reached down his hand would you mind singing that again thank [Music] you oh when he reached down his hand for me when he reach way down for for me I was lost and undone without God or his son when he reached down his head for now worship Him brothers and sisters this is a time for worship once my soul was astray from the Heavenly way and was red and vile as could be but my savior above gave me peace joy and love when he reached down his hand for me oh when he reached down his hand for [Music] me when he reach down his hand for me I was L and undone without God or his son when he reached down his hand for me brother and sisters can you believe the Apostle Paul in all that he did in all of the great work and all of the faith that he had when he said I haven't I haven't totally got it yet but I'm pressing towards that I'm working towards that that Mark of that High Calling I want it and he continued on we should never be satisfied and never look in the path fast but move forward Amen in the power and in the demonstration of the spirit of God and when we are not seeing that don't try to manufacture it don't try to make it up and say oh well this happened and try to twist it and and and make it be or or or have an an emotional experience but we want the real thing yes the blood of Jesus Christ has covered me I am redeemed I am filled with his Spirit now this water is going to flow from me brother and sisters am I the only one that really wants it do you want it it's for us Jesus Christ himself the god of the prophets promise that we could have it let's all stand brother Josiah I was nearing despair when he came to me there and he show me that I could be free well then he left at my feet gave me Glory complete when he reached down his hand for me oh when he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me I was lost UND without God or son when he reach down his hand for me and how my heart doth Rejoice since I made him my choice from The Tempest to him now I flee now I lean on his arm I'm secure from all harm since he reached down his hand for me amen sing it to the Lord and he reached down his hand for me oh when he reach way down for me I was lost and undone without God or his son when he reach down his head for me brothers and sisters and friends I mentioned a man that's very dear to me his Ministry if you don't know who William brandom was he was he was a great man of God that showed the love of God and showed the power of holy the Holy Spirit and a man he was I never knew him but his his ministry has been a mentor for me and it showed me that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we can't be a William brandham let me tell you something William can't brandham can't be a me either God has used chosen each one of us to do his will and his body is not perfect until every single piece of that body is placed and let me tell you something
