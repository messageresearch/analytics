[15:08] [Music]
[15:09] how many can testify that how do you
[15:12] know he lives he lives in me amen
[15:16] uh just a couple of requests brother
[15:19] lyle if he would
[15:21] come up and take these
[15:23] uh sister holly had
[15:25] put in a request you may have seen it
[15:27] today
[15:28] that the company she works for in the
[15:31] hospital is going out of business but
[15:34] somebody is possibly buying that company
[15:36] and
[15:37] just asking that the lord's will would
[15:39] be done and
[15:41] sometimes when we look at
[15:43] of ourselves and we say lord how am i
[15:45] going to do without this but he's a god
[15:47] that supplies every need
[15:49] my daughter naomi has been working
[15:52] at pima college through the bookstore
[15:54] for
[15:55] quite a few years and
[15:57] they just recently got bought out by
[15:59] barnes and noble
[16:00] and they're interviewing all the current
[16:03] employees
[16:04] and telling there's a possibility that
[16:06] they could keep their jobs under the new
[16:08] company so
[16:09] god is still able
[16:11] and he still meets every need so we have
[16:13] a praise also
[16:15] my wife had put in a prayer request for
[16:17] her nephew jared valenzuela
[16:20] he was released from the hospital two
[16:22] days after being admitted
[16:24] to icu with complications of diabetes so
[16:27] he's we've been released and he's home
[16:29] now
[16:29] but continuing to pray for jared's
[16:31] salvation along with mom and brother's
[16:34] salvation so this is my wife's
[16:36] youngest sister's family so
[16:39] and
[16:40] brother lyle can share
[16:42] with about his son joel as
[16:45] here and he'll let you know and if he
[16:46] would come
[16:52] just i just want to praise the lord uh
[16:54] last friday afternoon
[16:57] my son
[16:58] our son joel was in florida with his
[17:02] family and they were doing some boating
[17:04] stuff and as he was parking the boat at
[17:06] the dock
[17:07] he put his hand up to you know kind of
[17:10] ease it into the dock and a wave came
[17:12] and picked up the boat and slammed it
[17:13] into his finger it could have been his
[17:15] hand but it smashed and severed and i
[17:19] guess a fish ate the last inch of his
[17:21] finger
[17:22] and he was obviously in quite a lot of
[17:25] pain um but uh
[17:28] asked for prayer here from uh from a few
[17:30] folks and joel came back from florida
[17:35] monday he was able to have surgery done
[17:37] here in tucson
[17:39] and
[17:40] he just thanks the lord that all is
[17:42] going well with that
[17:44] and that uh he you know his attitude is
[17:47] that there's a purpose in everything god
[17:48] has a purpose for this and somehow god
[17:51] is going to get glory there's going to
[17:52] be some positive thing that comes from
[17:54] the loss of that finger so i i just
[17:57] thank
[17:57] everyone for their prayers i thank god
[18:00] for watching over my son that it wasn't
[18:02] his hand or his wrist that that boat
[18:04] prowl penetrated
[18:06] and that his attitude is so so positive
[18:09] and so gracious
[18:11] let's take these requests to the lord
[18:13] now in prayer because we know
[18:15] that god answers our prayers
[18:17] he hears our prayers he's not deaf
[18:20] he hears we don't have to shout we don't
[18:22] have to
[18:23] to do something to get his attention
[18:26] because he loves us and he dwells within
[18:28] us

[23:26] i don't know if you've heard our brother
[23:28] joel dalton passed away
[23:30] brother jim ed's brother part of the
[23:32] group i believe that was up in prescott
[23:35] and brother tom weathers sent this down
[23:37] saying the memorial service
[23:39] will be
[23:40] on july 9th at 1 pm
[23:43] at trinity heights methodist church in
[23:45] flagstaff for
[23:47] the dalton family and
[23:49] remembering them and the church up in
[23:52] flagstaff and all that areas
[23:56] we think well they lived a long and good
[23:58] life and all but still there's a loss so
[24:01] just remember them and then
[24:03] also spoke with brother mike patterson
[24:05] be a brother tom weathers because he'd
[24:07] been helping brother mike patterson
[24:09] after
[24:10] after brother mike had that stroke or
[24:12] what he had and
[24:14] they've actually closed down the church
[24:16] that was brother mike's he was not able
[24:17] to
[24:18] and
[24:20] in closing down the church brother
[24:21] mike's desire was all the other churches
[24:23] could have something from the church
[24:24] that they could use and brother
[24:26] tom said every every one of the churches
[24:28] in the phoenix area and all were able to
[24:30] either get some pews some music
[24:32] even a little pentecostal church down
[24:34] the street that needed some pews so
[24:37] and
[24:38] brother mike had been having he could
[24:40] read but he was not able to comprehend
[24:42] what he was reading for a while there
[24:44] and of course that would be extremely
[24:46] disappointing
[24:47] but his daughter sister rachel shared
[24:49] with brother tom that he's beginning to
[24:52] comprehend again and understand what
[24:54] he's reading and
[24:55] maybe it's something we take for granted
[24:58] until we can't do it or don't have it
[25:00] but thank the lord of the the good
[25:02] report we have but keeping him in in
[25:04] prayer and also

[40:46] but you're still the same yesterday
[40:47] today and forever lord
[40:50] father you desire that our hearts would
[40:52] be
[40:53] just completely laid open to you lord
[40:55] and let you do that work in us father
[40:58] as you minister to us in your word we
[41:00] ask lord that we can yield to it lord
[41:02] and you would have your own way in jesus
[41:04] christ's name
[41:05] amen god bless you as we listen
[41:12] you may be seated
[41:18] our heavenly father
[41:21] i want to express if i can this morning
[41:25] how in my heart i feel
[41:29] towards one
[41:31] the holiest of holy coming down to the
[41:35] earth and to redeem a sinner like myself
[41:40] and i'm sure that these ministers it's
[41:44] present now can
[41:46] feel the same way
[41:48] that it was by your grace that we have
[41:51] been made the ministers of this covenant
[41:56] that thou has given with adam's fallen
[41:59] race
[42:01] and we are here this morning father
[42:03] gathered for no other purpose
[42:05] but to
[42:07] know and to s to study to know rather
[42:10] the will of god
[42:12] and what we must do
[42:14] to make christ real to the people of
[42:17] this generation
[42:20] knowing surely that in the day of the
[42:23] judgment
[42:24] we will be brought face to face with
[42:26] this generation
[42:28] and being ministers
[42:30] we will
[42:32] be
[42:33] judges
[42:35] and the people to which we have spoken
[42:37] to and their attitude towards the word
[42:40] that we bring them
[42:42] will determine their eternal destination
[42:45] therefore lord in that day we would be a
[42:48] judge far our against the generation
[42:51] that we preach to
[42:53] father god
[42:54] please through jesus name let us not say
[42:57] one word that would be wrong
[43:00] but may we have sincere hearts and open
[43:03] minds that we might receive the things
[43:06] that's yours that we might be able
[43:09] to go out into our different fields of
[43:11] work after today and
[43:14] and be better equipped because of our
[43:16] meeting with you this morning
[43:18] granted lord won't you come and be our
[43:21] speaker and our ears and our tongue
[43:25] and our thoughts
[43:26] let the meditation my heart
[43:29] thoughts of my mind all that is within
[43:32] me and within these my brethren and
[43:35] sisters may it be acceptable in thy
[43:37] sight lord that we might be so filled in
[43:41] charge with thy spirit
[43:43] of your presence here that the room
[43:46] would become the room not so much the
[43:49] building that we are sitting in but the
[43:51] building that we are living in become
[43:54] all together a cloud of the glory of god
[43:58] we might leave here this morning so fill
[44:00] with the holy spirit that we would be
[44:02] more determined than ever before in life
[44:05] to carry the message to the dying
[44:06] generation that we're living in
[44:09] hear us lord and speak to us through thy
[44:12] word for we asked it in the name of thy
[44:15] son and our savior jesus christ amen
[44:23] i wish to read this morning
[44:26] um
[44:27] a portion of scripture found in the
[44:30] psalms
[44:32] the uh hundred and fifth psalm
[44:35] i wish to read just the potion you that
[44:38] keeps down these scripture readings i
[44:41] see many of them and we're ministers and

[45:47] mouth
[45:48] oh ye seed of abraham his servants ye
[45:51] children of jacob is chosen
[45:55] he is the lord our god
[45:57] his judgments are in
[46:00] all the earth
[46:04] he has remembered his covenant forever
[46:08] the words which he commanded to a
[46:10] thousand
[46:12] generations
[46:14] which covet he made with abraham and his
[46:18] oath unto isaac
[46:21] and confirmed the same unto jacob for
[46:23] our law and to israel for an everlasting
[46:27] covenant
[46:29] saying unto thee will i give the land of
[46:32] canaan the lot of your inheritance
[46:36] when
[46:37] they were but a few man in number
[46:40] yeah
[46:41] very few and strangers in it
[46:48] when they went from one nation to
[46:50] another and from one
[46:52] kingdom to another people he suffered no
[46:56] man to do them wrong
[46:59] yea he reproved kings for their sake
[47:03] saying
[47:04] touch not my anointed
[47:06] and do my prophets no harm
[47:12] may the lord bless the reading of his
[47:14] words
[47:19] i have a few scriptures written out here
[47:21] somewhere that i was going to refer to
[47:24] perhaps along the road
[47:29] i wonder today
[47:31] who's going to be the next president the
[47:34] election is coming up you know
[47:36] who's going to be president
[47:40] this next term
[47:42] what if i knew
[47:45] there's only one that does know and
[47:47] that's god
[47:50] and what if god would reveal to me who's
[47:53] going to be the next president
[47:55] and i stood here in phoenix and made a
[47:58] prediction that such and such a man
[48:01] would be the next president of the
[48:02] united states
[48:05] and they would place that in papers and
[48:08] so forth and i would hit it right on the
[48:11] dot
[48:12] it would be perfect
[48:16] and
[48:17] it would be all that i had said would
[48:20] come to pass but what good would it do
[48:24] what good is it anyhow if i
[48:27] if i should do such a thing
[48:30] the papers would advertise it and it
[48:33] would go out maybe if such a person
[48:35] could make such a prediction
[48:37] and it would be true all the newspapers
[48:39] and magazines would would pass on it
[48:44] but you know that god doesn't do things
[48:47] like that
[48:49] god doesn't use his power and his gifts
[48:52] for
[48:53] foolishness
[48:55] it's going to be whatever is president
[48:57] it'll be president and to know now which
[49:00] would be president wouldn't help us one
[49:03] penny
[49:05] it wouldn't do us one bit of good to
[49:08] know who's going to be president
[49:12] so therefore god doesn't do those things
[49:14] like that and then if i made such a
[49:18] prediction as that and it come to pass
[49:21] and the newspapers packed it
[49:24] and the magazines
[49:25] then
[49:27] it would be to my glory
[49:30] people would say look what a great
[49:31] prophet brother branham is
[49:34] he told us
[49:35] long before it happened just who would
[49:39] be president and that would be to my
[49:41] glory
[49:43] but god doesn't want he's not interested
[49:45] in working things to my glory
[49:49] or to
[49:50] to any other man's glory
[49:53] he's interested to work things to his
[49:56] glory something that will profit
[50:01] like paul said if we speak with tongues
[50:03] and do not have an interpreter what good
[50:06] does it do we only glorify ourselves
[50:10] and that's uh edify ourselves that's uh
[50:14] connie out of the line for god
[50:18] god wants to be edified himself
[50:22] and we're to not seek self edification
[50:25] but to edify god with all we do
[50:30] so therefore
[50:31] i believe this morning if i knew who he
[50:33] would be
[50:35] and exactly when he would be elected and
[50:37] all how many votes he'd be over under or
[50:40] whatever it might be
[50:42] it wouldn't do one bit of good to tell
[50:45] it
[50:46] it'd be best for me just to keep it
[50:48] still if i did know it
[50:50] not try to publish it because there
[50:53] would be there would be no reason for me
[50:55] to do it
[50:57] because it's going to be anyhow and it
[50:59] doesn't make us that much difference
[51:02] uh who's going to be president but god
[51:06] when he uses his gifts
[51:09] he uses them for his own glory and for
[51:14] the glory of
[51:16] his
[51:17] people
[51:18] for the glory of his church
[51:21] for the edifying of the body of christ
[51:24] and for the glory of the kingdom of god
[51:28] that's why he gives these things in his
[51:31] church
[51:32] why yes teachers prophets evangelists
[51:36] pastors
[51:37] they are for the edification of the
[51:41] church
[51:43] and for the glory of god
[51:46] the prophet is not to get out and mingle
[51:48] with the world and try to take a gift
[51:50] like balaam did
[51:52] and make havoc or or money out of it or
[51:56] something
[51:57] if he's a prophet he's supposed to
[51:59] reveal god to the church and stay out of
[52:02] the things of the world
[52:05] it's all for the glory of god
[52:08] now we do have
[52:11] and i think it's a good thing for us as
[52:14] ministers
[52:16] to follow our order when we see such
[52:19] things in the world as we see today
[52:22] and we have an order from god
[52:25] is for the discerning of spirits trying
[52:29] the spirit
[52:32] i believe that that is a very great
[52:35] lesson for the church today
[52:38] is to try the spirit of anything
[52:42] have discernment of the spirit
[52:46] i do not think that we should ever by
[52:49] any means ever try to
[52:52] judge a person by the denomination they
[52:54] belong to
[52:56] or
[52:57] by the group that they are assembled
[53:00] with whether they be methodist baptist
[53:03] presbyterian pentecostal or
[53:06] whatever they are we should never
[53:09] judge the man
[53:10] by the denomination that he belongs to
[53:15] we should always judge him by the spirit
[53:18] he has
[53:20] seen
[53:21] the spirit whether he's a
[53:25] latter rain or farmer rain or inner
[53:28] outer rain or no rain or whatever it
[53:30] might be
[53:32] we should never judge him by that but by
[53:34] his
[53:35] spirit we are to discern
[53:38] spirits
[53:40] watch what the man has in mind
[53:44] what he has what he's trying to achieve
[53:48] if the man by a gift no matter how great
[53:51] the gift is
[53:54] now
[53:55] i want to get this to the church this
[53:57] morning which into the different
[53:59] denominations you are still the church
[54:02] of the living god together
[54:06] and
[54:07] this is the thing i want to get to you
[54:10] see that we are really not divided
[54:14] we are the stones that's cut in
[54:16] different forms all to the glory of god
[54:20] now there is so much in the day that we
[54:23] live in
[54:24] pertaining to gifts
[54:27] so many people judge people by gifts
[54:30] that they have
[54:32] well i believe that these things are
[54:35] gifts
[54:36] i believe that what we see take place is
[54:39] gifts
[54:41] and they're god-given gifts
[54:44] but we
[54:45] if we do not use them in the right way
[54:49] that god intended them to be used then
[54:52] we can do more harm with the gifts
[54:56] than we could if we did not have the
[54:58] gifts
[55:01] the other night i made a statement at
[55:03] the pulpit saying this
[55:05] that i would rather see brotherly love
[55:08] existing among the church if we didn't
[55:10] have one case of healing or anything
[55:12] else
[55:14] we must know what these things are for
[55:18] now if a man comes and he has a great
[55:21] gift
[55:22] no matter if he belongs to our
[55:24] denomination or another denomination
[55:27] don't judge him by what denomination he
[55:29] come from how he dresses
[55:32] but what you want to see is what he's
[55:34] trying to do with that gift
[55:37] what purpose he has
[55:39] if he's trying to take his influence and
[55:42] build himself a great name out of it
[55:44] i'd have discernment of spirit enough to
[55:47] know that's wrong
[55:49] no matter how great her teacher he is
[55:51] how powerful he is how intellectual he
[55:53] is or how his gift operates
[55:57] if he isn't trying to achieve something
[56:00] for the benefit of the body of christ
[56:04] your own spiritual discernment would
[56:06] tell you that that's wrong
[56:08] no matter how accurate how perfect how
[56:11] it is it's wrong if it isn't used for
[56:14] the body of jesus christ
[56:19] to achieve something
[56:22] maybe he's got a great gift that he
[56:23] could draw people together with a great
[56:26] intellectual or a spiritual power that
[56:28] he could draw people together and maybe
[56:30] he's trying to take that gift and make
[56:32] himself famous
[56:35] so he'll have a big name
[56:38] so that other brethren will look up to
[56:40] him as some big person
[56:42] then that's wrong
[56:44] amen
[56:45] maybe he's trying to
[56:47] to edify a certain thing here that he
[56:50] wants everybody else to get out of the
[56:52] picture and let him and his group be the
[56:54] picture that's still
[56:56] wrong but if he has a gift of god and
[57:00] he's trying to edify the body of christ
[57:04] then i don't care what he belongs to
[57:07] you're not discerning the man you're
[57:09] discerning the spirit the life that's in
[57:12] the man
[57:13] and that's what god told us to do
[57:17] not one time was we ever commissioned to
[57:19] discern
[57:20] the uh
[57:22] the man's group
[57:23] but we was
[57:25] uh constrained and commanded by god to
[57:29] discern the spirit in the man
[57:34] what he's trying to do
[57:36] what the spirit in his life is trying to
[57:39] lead him to
[57:41] and then if we can find out that he's
[57:44] trying to lead the people
[57:47] not to break them up
[57:49] but to bring them together
[57:51] and to bring the church of the living
[57:53] god not all to one denomination but to
[57:56] an understanding
[57:59] a fellowship
[58:01] a unity of spirit
[58:03] then if he is former rain or latter rain
[58:06] or whatever it is his spirit and his
[58:10] purpose is right
[58:12] and the spirit that's in him no matter
[58:14] what move he belongs to the spirit
[58:16] that's in him is trying to part the
[58:19] people to calvary away from himself or
[58:23] away from anything else but his only
[58:25] achievement he has is to point them to
[58:28] calvary
[58:30] he doesn't care whether he's even knowed
[58:32] or not he doesn't care whether he's even
[58:34] his own movement which is fine
[58:37] see it's good if he is a methodist or a
[58:41] presbyterian or a roman catholic or
[58:44] whatever he wants to be by denomination
[58:47] but what is he trying to do the purpose
[58:50] of his heart that he's trying to get
[58:52] then you can see what's in the man's
[58:54] life
[58:55] whether his motives as far as his
[58:58] denomination whether it's for his self
[59:01] whether it's for
[59:02] worldly fame whether it's for big names
[59:05] to say i predicted that come just
[59:08] exactly to pass now i see that's wrong
[59:11] right there to begin with but if he's
[59:13] trying to use what god's given as a
[59:15] teacher as a prophet as a seer
[59:19] a new testament prophet is a preacher we
[59:21] all know that just any minister that's a
[59:23] preacher is a prophet a new testament
[59:25] prophet if he's prophesying preaching
[59:29] not to try to edify himself to make a
[59:31] big name
[59:32] or to edify his organization which he
[59:35] should be in an organization here i am
[59:38] without one but yet preaching you should
[59:40] be that's right every man ought to have
[59:43] a church home
[59:44] you ought to have a place not just to
[59:47] float about from pillar to post but have
[59:49] somewhere that you go to church and you
[59:51] call it your church somewhere you pay
[59:53] your tithes
[59:55] and somewhere that you help support the
[59:57] cause take your choice
[59:59] but then don't never disfellowship the
[1:00:01] other man because he don't belong with
[1:00:03] your group
[1:00:04] see discern his spirit and see if he's
[1:00:06] got the same purpose in heart then
[1:00:08] you've got fellowship one with another
[1:00:10] you're working for one great cause
[1:00:12] that's the cause of christ
[1:00:14] i think that is absolutely true
[1:00:17] now if we will notice
[1:00:19] the motives and objectives of the old
[1:00:22] testament prophets
[1:00:26] them man had one objective
[1:00:28] that was jesus christ
[1:00:31] they had one thing that their whole
[1:00:33] theme of the old testament was built
[1:00:36] around the coming messiah
[1:00:39] they
[1:00:40] they did not go out and do things just
[1:00:43] for money or for fame
[1:00:45] they had one thing they were anointed
[1:00:48] with the spirit of god and they
[1:00:51] predicted the coming messiah
[1:00:55] and those men were so anointed with the
[1:00:58] spirit
[1:00:59] until they sometimes acted
[1:01:03] like the spirit that was within them
[1:01:06] they spoke seemingly of themselves
[1:01:10] watch how the spirit of god made that
[1:01:12] man act
[1:01:14] we'll take for instance moses
[1:01:16] the great prophet
[1:01:18] how that
[1:01:20] that man had no selfish objectives at
[1:01:23] all
[1:01:24] he could have been the king of egypt
[1:01:27] he could have had the world under his
[1:01:29] feet
[1:01:30] but because that he was a
[1:01:33] prophet at heart
[1:01:37] he refused to be called the son of
[1:01:40] pharaoh's daughter
[1:01:42] choosing rather to suffer the
[1:01:44] persecution
[1:01:46] and the trials
[1:01:48] of christ esteeming the treasures of
[1:01:52] heaven greater treasures than them of
[1:01:54] egypt he forsook and denied himself of
[1:01:58] the worldly
[1:02:00] fame
[1:02:01] of the luxury and the
[1:02:04] the things that life offers
[1:02:07] he had to look beyond that
[1:02:12] see
[1:02:13] he could have been that
[1:02:14] just take the minister today
[1:02:16] if he has the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:02:20] and he knows that if he preaches that
[1:02:22] word it's going to cut his fame down
[1:02:26] it's going to put him in a little bitty
[1:02:27] church somewhere or maybe out on the
[1:02:30] street
[1:02:32] but he knows that something in his heart
[1:02:35] is burning
[1:02:38] he sees the coming of the lord he
[1:02:40] doesn't care whether that he has a big
[1:02:43] church or a little church
[1:02:45] he doesn't care whether he has
[1:02:47] today's food or not no food
[1:02:49] he doesn't care whether he has good
[1:02:51] clothes or doesn't have good clothes
[1:02:53] he's only mindful of one thing and
[1:02:56] that's the very life within him crying
[1:02:59] out
[1:03:02] he's trying to achieve something
[1:03:05] for the glory of god
[1:03:07] and that man in doing so will act the
[1:03:09] very life of the spirit that's in him
[1:03:14] do you follow me he'll act it out look
[1:03:17] at moses when he come to a time that he
[1:03:21] displayed all his life was the spirit of
[1:03:23] christ
[1:03:24] for christ was in him
[1:03:28] christ was in moses by measure
[1:03:31] now if we notice he was born
[1:03:35] in the time of persecution
[1:03:38] the children was killed to try to get
[1:03:40] him just exactly like they did uh jesus
[1:03:45] and we find out that when it come to a
[1:03:48] place that the children of israel had
[1:03:50] disobeyed in such a way
[1:03:54] until god was angry with them
[1:03:58] and he said to moses
[1:04:00] step aside
[1:04:03] and i'll destroy the whole group of them
[1:04:07] and i'll take of you and raise up
[1:04:08] another generation moses chew himself in
[1:04:12] the path of god's judgment
[1:04:15] and said take me before you take them
[1:04:18] in other words before you can get them
[1:04:19] you'll have to come over me
[1:04:22] that's exactly what jesus christ did
[1:04:26] when god would have wiped the whole face
[1:04:28] of the earth off with these sinners you
[1:04:30] and i
[1:04:31] but christ threw yourself in the path
[1:04:36] god could not do it he couldn't come
[1:04:37] over his own son
[1:04:40] and when god seen that spirit in moses
[1:04:42] hanging in the judgment like a crosser
[1:04:45] you can't come to him you'll have to
[1:04:47] take me first
[1:04:50] see the spirit of god in moses
[1:04:53] when he could have been king of egypt
[1:04:56] when he could have had every luxury in
[1:04:58] the world to be popular
[1:05:01] when he could have been the great king
[1:05:03] of the world at that time
[1:05:05] but he chose to suffer the persecutions
[1:05:09] and the affliction for he esteemed the
[1:05:11] reproach of christ greater treasures and
[1:05:14] that of egypt amen
[1:05:17] you see he threw his self in a way why
[1:05:20] it was god in moses did that
[1:05:23] the normal thinking intellectual man
[1:05:26] would never do that
[1:05:28] he would take the easy road
[1:05:30] so no matter how much a fanatic moses
[1:05:32] seemed to be he was trying you see he
[1:05:34] was a true prophet of god because he was
[1:05:37] trying to achieve something for the
[1:05:39] kingdom of god
[1:05:41] now with his great gift of prophecy he
[1:05:44] might have been a wise man could have
[1:05:45] stood up in egypt and said now wait i'll
[1:05:48] prophesy so and so
[1:05:49] i'll say so and so and as with his
[1:05:52] prophecy
[1:05:53] but in in all he had been world famous
[1:05:57] but if that wasn't in his heart
[1:06:00] it couldn't be in his heart
[1:06:02] so if you see a person with a great gift
[1:06:05] trying to do something to glorify
[1:06:06] themselves
[1:06:08] your own discernment of the spirit tells
[1:06:10] you that's wrong
[1:06:13] but moses was trying to achieve
[1:06:15] something for the glory of god no matter
[1:06:18] how bad it was how evil it looked how
[1:06:20] much it was talked about the spirit in
[1:06:23] moses directed him straight to the line
[1:06:26] of duty
[1:06:28] the spirit in him look at joseph
[1:06:31] joseph was when he was born he was loved
[1:06:35] of the father and hated by his brethren
[1:06:39] perfect type of christ
[1:06:41] and the only he was a blood brother to
[1:06:43] them the same father but the reason his
[1:06:46] brethren hated him was about a cause
[1:06:50] because god had made him a prophet
[1:06:53] spiritual a seer
[1:06:55] and they hated him for that very purpose
[1:06:59] but joseph could not help it because god
[1:07:02] had made him that way
[1:07:04] and what's the spirit of god in joseph
[1:07:10] watch what he did he even acted the part
[1:07:13] of christ
[1:07:16] he was hated of his brethren loved of
[1:07:19] his father because of the spirit made
[1:07:22] the difference
[1:07:23] he was a spiritual man
[1:07:26] he saw visions
[1:07:28] he interpreted dreams
[1:07:30] he did not do it for his own glory
[1:07:32] he did it because there was something in
[1:07:35] him
[1:07:36] the spirit of god
[1:07:38] he wouldn't have went out there by his
[1:07:40] own self and have been thrown into a
[1:07:42] ditch and have his poor old father to
[1:07:44] grieve all those years sold for nearly
[1:07:47] 30 pieces of silver taken up from the
[1:07:50] ditch and became the right-hand man of
[1:07:53] pharaoh the king of earth at that time
[1:07:56] and in his prison house there was a
[1:07:59] butler and a baker and one was lost and
[1:08:02] the other was saved by his prediction in
[1:08:06] the prison house
[1:08:08] and did you notice jesus
[1:08:10] when he came he was loved of the father
[1:08:14] and the father gave joseph a coat of
[1:08:17] many colors the rainbow a covenant
[1:08:21] and the father god gave his son jesus
[1:08:24] the covenant
[1:08:28] and then
[1:08:30] the jewish brother
[1:08:31] hated him
[1:08:33] without a cause
[1:08:36] he had no reason to hate him
[1:08:38] he was spiritual and he was god's word
[1:08:41] made manifest
[1:08:44] he come to do the will of the father he
[1:08:47] come to fulfill the scriptures he came
[1:08:49] to bring them peace
[1:08:51] but they misunderstood him and hated him
[1:08:53] without a cause
[1:08:55] they didn't stop to try to see what he
[1:08:57] was trying to achieve
[1:09:00] they just judged him because he didn't
[1:09:02] agree with them
[1:09:04] they may he makes himself so and so
[1:09:06] he makes himself god
[1:09:09] he was god
[1:09:11] god was in him the bible said god was in
[1:09:14] christ
[1:09:15] manifesting himself to the world
[1:09:18] he was the god of glory
[1:09:22] manifesting the glory of god
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:26] look at moses he couldn't help throwing
[1:09:28] himself there
[1:09:30] he didn't do that hypocritically
[1:09:32] he did it because
[1:09:34] god was in him
[1:09:38] neither could joseph help being what he
[1:09:40] was
[1:09:41] because it was god in him working or
[1:09:44] displaying himself through the man
[1:09:48] never did he do it for self glory
[1:09:50] any man that if those priests would only
[1:09:52] have the discernment of spirit as i'm
[1:09:55] speaking to you this morning regardless
[1:09:56] of how much the world talked about him
[1:09:59] they still would have known
[1:10:02] if they'd look to the word if they were
[1:10:05] seeing his purpose
[1:10:07] he was always doing that to glorify the
[1:10:09] father
[1:10:10] he said they said oh this man's a great
[1:10:12] healer he does these things like that he
[1:10:15] said i can do nothing till the father
[1:10:17] shows me
[1:10:19] it is not me that doeth the works
[1:10:23] it's the father that dwelleth in me he
[1:10:25] doeth the works
[1:10:28] he never took the glory
[1:10:31] neither would any servant of god take
[1:10:33] glory
[1:10:34] neither would any servant of god take a
[1:10:36] gift of god and try to glorify himself
[1:10:38] or anything else but his right
[1:10:40] achievement is to do something to the
[1:10:42] glory of god
[1:10:45] that's why i see the same thing today
[1:10:48] we must have discernment of spirit
[1:10:51] to see a person what they're trying to
[1:10:53] do
[1:10:54] are they trying to glorify god are they
[1:10:57] trying to glorify themselves now the
[1:10:59] spirit of god working in man makes man
[1:11:03] act like god
[1:11:07] no wonder jesus said is not it written
[1:11:10] ye are gods
[1:11:14] and if they call them gods to whom the
[1:11:16] spirit of god came to how can you
[1:11:19] condemn me that when i am the son of god
[1:11:23] if you could see the spirit of god in
[1:11:25] moses
[1:11:26] which he was god
[1:11:28] moses was a god
[1:11:30] joseph was a god the prophets were gods
[1:11:33] the bible said they were yes
[1:11:35] they were gods because
[1:11:38] they had completely surrendered
[1:11:39] themselves to the spirit of god that
[1:11:42] they were working for the glory of god
[1:11:45] and when a man is so anointed with the
[1:11:48] spirit
[1:11:50] i'll let this go real deep under the
[1:11:54] fifth rib on the left side
[1:11:56] when a man is anointed of the spirit of
[1:11:59] god his habits his actions and
[1:12:02] everything is god moving in him
[1:12:06] sometimes he's misjudged look at david
[1:12:08] in the 23rd psalm he cried my god my god
[1:12:13] why has thou forsaken me
[1:12:17] as if he was
[1:12:19] if david was the man
[1:12:21] all they that passed me by shoot their
[1:12:24] lip out at me
[1:12:26] he was so anointed with god
[1:12:29] he was so perfectly surrendered to god
[1:12:33] and the anointing was on him in such a
[1:12:34] way and when he cried by the spirit of
[1:12:37] god if somebody been standing there say
[1:12:39] well look he thinks somebody shoot their
[1:12:41] lip out at him
[1:12:43] why is god forsaken him
[1:12:45] it wasn't david it was a spirit crying
[1:12:48] out through david amen
[1:12:51] my god my god why has i forsaken me my
[1:12:55] bones all stare at me
[1:12:57] they have pierced my hands and my feet
[1:13:00] well somebody said listen to that
[1:13:01] hypocrite up there whose hands is
[1:13:04] pierced whose feet is pierced
[1:13:06] that's the intellectual but one who had
[1:13:08] discernment of spirit
[1:13:10] knew that that was the spirit of god in
[1:13:12] him crying out
[1:13:15] when a man is anointed of the spirit of
[1:13:17] god he's got the action of god
[1:13:20] and the action of god is never to break
[1:13:23] us up
[1:13:24] the action of god is to draw us together
[1:13:26] for we are one in christ jesus and god's
[1:13:30] purpose is to bring us together
[1:13:33] love
[1:13:35] one another
[1:13:37] now that great prophets we see the
[1:13:40] spirit moving in them jesus called them
[1:13:44] gods he said they were gods
[1:13:47] now when the spirit come to them by
[1:13:50] measure
[1:13:52] but when he come on the one jesus which
[1:13:54] was the son of god it come to him
[1:13:57] without measure
[1:13:59] the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt
[1:14:01] in him for he was the perfect example
[1:14:06] he was god of glory
[1:14:09] manifesting the glory of god
[1:14:12] to the people god in him going about
[1:14:15] watch his life
[1:14:17] all the old testament he was the theme
[1:14:22] of the old testament all the old
[1:14:24] prophets back in the old testament cried
[1:14:27] out not to themselves
[1:14:30] they cried out under the spirit of god
[1:14:32] making them act like god in so much that
[1:14:34] they were called gods
[1:14:36] and then the fullness of that spirit was
[1:14:38] manifested in jesus christ
[1:14:41] look at david
[1:14:42] when he was dethroned as the king of
[1:14:45] israel rejected by his own people going
[1:14:48] up mount olives north of jerusalem and
[1:14:50] he looked back over the city and wept
[1:14:55] because he was rejected
[1:14:59] what was it it was the spirit of christ
[1:15:02] 500 years later the son of david
[1:15:06] jesus sat on the same mount looking over
[1:15:10] the city as a rejected king and cried
[1:15:13] jerusalem jerusalem
[1:15:16] off what i have gathered you your
[1:15:18] different denominations and everything
[1:15:20] as a hindus are brood
[1:15:23] but you would not
[1:15:24] how often i have did it
[1:15:27] now the same spirit that was in david
[1:15:30] that was manifested in fullness in
[1:15:32] christ is in the church today crying to
[1:15:35] the peoples
[1:15:37] how oft would i have gathered you and
[1:15:40] when you see separations and and
[1:15:43] differences and
[1:15:44] and brotherhood broken up and christian
[1:15:47] life one against the other then it makes
[1:15:50] the spirit of god in your heart cry out
[1:15:54] you're trying to achieve something a
[1:15:57] true prophet of god a true teacher is
[1:16:00] trying to bring the church to a unity of
[1:16:02] spirit
[1:16:03] a unity of spirit that they might
[1:16:06] recognize god
[1:16:08] trying to achieve it no matter what
[1:16:10] denomination they belong to or what
[1:16:12] about it
[1:16:13] we have discernment of spirit to discern
[1:16:15] the spirit that's in the man to see if
[1:16:17] it be the spirit of god or not
[1:16:20] now
[1:16:21] we noticed when he was here on earth i
[1:16:24] went about doing good
[1:16:25] i noticed another thing that come to my
[1:16:27] mind
[1:16:28] did you notice when david was rejected
[1:16:31] as king
[1:16:32] he went out of the city and a little
[1:16:34] benjamin mine
[1:16:35] benjamin which was supposed to have been
[1:16:38] a brother to him should have been sorry
[1:16:40] because he was rejected
[1:16:42] but what he was a crippled man
[1:16:45] and he drug along there with his
[1:16:47] crippled condition throwing dirt on
[1:16:49] david
[1:16:51] and calling him all kinds of bad names
[1:16:53] and cursing him
[1:16:57] in the name of the lord
[1:16:59] cursing king david in the name of the
[1:17:02] lord this little crippled up vengeance
[1:17:05] watch the spirit of god in the spirit of
[1:17:07] the devil working
[1:17:10] now if you notice he was crippled it
[1:17:13] represents the spiritual crippledness of
[1:17:15] the people today that would make fun
[1:17:19] of the true spirit of god in christ
[1:17:22] manifesting itself
[1:17:25] that was the spirit of christ and david
[1:17:27] being rejected as a king
[1:17:30] and today when the people make fun of
[1:17:32] the people who has received the holy
[1:17:34] spirit and trying to achieve something
[1:17:36] to draw methodists and pentecostals and
[1:17:39] baptists and pentecostals and
[1:17:40] presbyterians and all together as a
[1:17:43] unity as a body of christ
[1:17:48] and they see the spirit work you say
[1:17:50] well look that's a pentecostal
[1:17:52] away with him i know one went off with
[1:17:55] another man's wife i know this and got
[1:17:57] drunk i know this one did this i know
[1:17:58] this and did that
[1:18:00] all that but they're big enough to hide
[1:18:02] their own things
[1:18:04] they can hide it
[1:18:06] but david was exposed
[1:18:09] wow he had the spirit of christ in him
[1:18:15] that guard said shall i take the head of
[1:18:17] that dog
[1:18:18] that would curse my king
[1:18:21] what's the spirit of christ and david
[1:18:23] let him alone
[1:18:25] for the lord has told him to curse me
[1:18:30] do you catch that
[1:18:33] let him alone
[1:18:35] the lord has told him to curse me
[1:18:39] instead today we don't get up our fist
[1:18:40] and fight him
[1:18:42] chop his head off yeah get him out he
[1:18:44] don't belong to us
[1:18:46] let him on
[1:18:48] the lord has told him to curse me that
[1:18:50] little run along earth throwing
[1:18:52] dirt on david that's what they do today
[1:18:54] on the spirit of christ they're a bunch
[1:18:56] of holy rollers but they're a bunch of
[1:18:58] this there's nothing to them there's
[1:19:00] nothing to divine healing there's no
[1:19:02] such thing as angels there's no such
[1:19:04] thing as prophets all those things the
[1:19:06] days of miracles has passed through a
[1:19:07] dirt but let them on
[1:19:10] but when david returned in power
[1:19:14] hallelujah
[1:19:15] when he come back
[1:19:17] as full king of israel
[1:19:20] don't worry this jesus whose spirit we
[1:19:23] have today
[1:19:24] acted his part i will return again in a
[1:19:27] physical body
[1:19:28] a second time in glory and power and
[1:19:31] majesty
[1:19:33] that little dirt thrower fell on his
[1:19:35] face and beg for mercy
[1:19:38] so let him alone
[1:19:40] the spirit of christ in us don't
[1:19:42] excommunicate him let's remember that
[1:19:44] all these things has got to come to pass
[1:19:47] we've got one thing to do move on
[1:19:50] god promised that he'd make everything
[1:19:52] work together for good to them that love
[1:19:53] him let's keep the discernment of the
[1:19:55] spirit keep the objective right we're
[1:19:58] here to serve god
[1:19:59] each one fellowshipping going along and
[1:20:02] serving god if the man's got the wrong
[1:20:04] kind of an objective then what will
[1:20:06] happen see
[1:20:08] now we find out that the spirit of god
[1:20:11] was in him all the old prophets spoke of
[1:20:14] him
[1:20:15] all the spirits in potion every little
[1:20:18] potion wasn't glorifying itself true
[1:20:20] prophets
[1:20:22] all the true prophets was manifesting
[1:20:24] him
[1:20:25] speaking of him and everything they said
[1:20:29] was fulfilled in him showed it was the
[1:20:32] spirit of god in them
[1:20:34] it was fulfilled what was it god
[1:20:36] speaking of himself
[1:20:38] see god manifesting himself through
[1:20:40] these prophets not taking glory he'll be
[1:20:42] the next president who will be this and
[1:20:44] hit you your head tell us who hit you
[1:20:46] and we'll believe you that isn't it
[1:20:48] it's something to manifest god it isn't
[1:20:51] something to make brother weather share
[1:20:52] our brother shores or brother uh so and
[1:20:55] so out there a great man make him a
[1:20:58] greater than the rest of the man of his
[1:20:59] group make him the greatest man in
[1:21:01] phoenix he is going to make william
[1:21:02] branham something great but what is to
[1:21:04] do it is to make oral robbers something
[1:21:06] great billy graham something great but
[1:21:08] it's our hearts
[1:21:10] we're trying to achieve something for
[1:21:12] the kingdom of god it's manifesting god
[1:21:17] all gifts and things doesn't make one
[1:21:19] greater than the other it just makes us
[1:21:21] all working together
[1:21:23] for the perfection of the body
[1:21:25] to bring us together as one people as a
[1:21:28] people of god
[1:21:30] but when you see them going contrary
[1:21:32] don't curse them
[1:21:33] just let them alone somebody has to do
[1:21:36] it
[1:21:38] but wait till jesus comes in power
[1:21:40] now we see all those prophets speaking
[1:21:43] every one of them was glorifying god and
[1:21:45] the coming messiah
[1:21:47] and when they got in the spirit
[1:21:50] they acted and spoke and lived the life
[1:21:53] out just like the messiah did
[1:21:56] if it did
[1:21:57] that side the cross speaking of his
[1:22:00] coming how much more will it after his
[1:22:02] coming will put the spirit of the
[1:22:04] messiah in the church to act do work and
[1:22:07] live like the messiah
[1:22:10] it's the spirit of god
[1:22:12] discern that spirit
[1:22:14] see whether it is of god or not see
[1:22:16] whether it acts like him see if your
[1:22:18] emotions if somebody kicks up something
[1:22:20] against you and throws dirt upon your
[1:22:22] life when you know you're as innocent as
[1:22:23] you can be
[1:22:24] and you know what you've got the spirit
[1:22:26] of god don't try to
[1:22:28] separate yourself don't try to act mean
[1:22:30] towards him don't curse him just walk on
[1:22:33] knowing god did that to give you a test
[1:22:35] to see how you take it
[1:22:38] he'll have to come to it anyhow
[1:22:41] as i said the other day i believe in
[1:22:42] brother fuller's church
[1:22:44] of the bicycle rider in canada
[1:22:46] well all of them thought they could out
[1:22:48] ride this boy this little old
[1:22:50] and he's the only one couldn't hire
[1:22:52] right without holding the handlebars
[1:22:54] i'm glad i like to be one of those
[1:22:55] handlebar riders take a hold of both
[1:22:57] sides of the cross and say nothing in my
[1:22:59] arms i bring
[1:23:01] let me hold to the cross lord i have no
[1:23:04] intellectuals i have nothing let me just
[1:23:06] hold here
[1:23:08] look way out down there
[1:23:09] and they had a 12 inch plank to ride for
[1:23:12] a city block to get a 100 schwinn
[1:23:14] bicycle all those boys you could ride
[1:23:16] without holding go downtown get their
[1:23:17] mother's groceries and come back without
[1:23:19] even touching the handlebars they
[1:23:20] everyone began to look they wasn't used
[1:23:23] to holding to the handle of ours and
[1:23:24] they fell off
[1:23:26] but this little boy got on there and
[1:23:27] helped the handle of ours and wrote it
[1:23:29] to the end
[1:23:30] they asked himself how did you do it he
[1:23:32] says here's where you make your mistake
[1:23:34] fellas you're all better writers than i
[1:23:35] am but you were looking here and said it
[1:23:38] made you nervous to see what you're
[1:23:39] trying to balance yourself and you fell
[1:23:41] off said i never looked here at all i
[1:23:43] watched the end
[1:23:44] and it's kept steady that's what we're
[1:23:47] to do
[1:23:48] don't look at these little things now
[1:23:49] did this one do this or that one do that
[1:23:51] watch the end and keep studying
[1:23:54] christ is coming
[1:23:56] watch the end
[1:23:57] just keep studying don't notice what's
[1:23:59] going on now watch what's going to go on
[1:24:01] out down there
[1:24:03] at the end time when we're going to have
[1:24:04] to stand and give an account for our
[1:24:06] lives david wasn't watching that little
[1:24:08] benjamin throw dirt on him he's crippled
[1:24:10] anyhow
[1:24:12] he never noticed him he wouldn't even
[1:24:13] let the guard cut his head off today him
[1:24:16] alone god told him to do that god told
[1:24:18] him to curse me let him alone or david
[1:24:21] knew that someday
[1:24:24] he was returning in power
[1:24:27] that benjamin did have his time
[1:24:30] yes
[1:24:31] that's it the church will rise and
[1:24:33] triumph
[1:24:36] i just sent to pray for his sick
[1:24:37] children anyhow that's all i can do
[1:24:39] wherever they are and what church they
[1:24:41] are it makes me no different i'm trying
[1:24:43] to pray for his sick children
[1:24:45] trying to manifest the gift for his
[1:24:47] glory
[1:24:48] that's reason i never did belong to
[1:24:50] anything now remember that's all right
[1:24:51] see i'm not i'm not saying that now i
[1:24:53] want you to get it clear i believe that
[1:24:55] god's got christians in every church his
[1:24:58] children
[1:24:59] he's never questioned me on that i just
[1:25:01] have to pray for the children
[1:25:03] and to do these things
[1:25:04] and to manifest him
[1:25:06] now you see jesus and these prophets
[1:25:08] everything that they spoke of had to be
[1:25:11] true for it was the power of god in them
[1:25:15] god himself speaking through them of his
[1:25:17] own self-coming to his own glory
[1:25:22] who's president
[1:25:23] who's gonna is they go to uh are we
[1:25:26] gonna have enough rain this year
[1:25:28] i don't mean nothing
[1:25:30] something to the glory of god something
[1:25:32] to set the church in order something for
[1:25:34] the power of god not to make yourself a
[1:25:36] name but to make the glory of god
[1:25:38] manifested now
[1:25:40] we notice that all those prophets and
[1:25:43] all they said about him everything come
[1:25:45] to true because he was the theme of the
[1:25:48] old testament jesus the messiah coming
[1:25:51] messiah was what every prophet looked
[1:25:54] from from adam
[1:25:56] to my malachi
[1:25:58] every prophet spoke of the coming of the
[1:26:00] lord each one put his part in because he
[1:26:03] was anointed of god that's all he could
[1:26:05] speak of
[1:26:06] now wish we had more time on it but
[1:26:10] watch everything that they said come to
[1:26:12] pass lookie here let's just take some of
[1:26:14] the things that the prophet said a
[1:26:16] virgin shall conceive and bear a child
[1:26:18] did it happen
[1:26:19] sure
[1:26:20] his name shall be called emmanuel
[1:26:22] uh
[1:26:24] prince of peace mighty god everlasting
[1:26:27] father that's what he was exactly the
[1:26:29] everlasting father no man shall be
[1:26:31] called father on this earth but god is
[1:26:33] your father all right now let's see
[1:26:35] again he was wounded for our
[1:26:37] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:26:39] iniquity the chaste of our peace upon
[1:26:41] him with his stripes we were healed
[1:26:43] pilate's judgment hall while the very
[1:26:45] man having his back length like that
[1:26:48] with a catalyzed tail whip didn't
[1:26:50] realize that the scripture said it would
[1:26:52] be that way they didn't have discernment
[1:26:54] of spirit
[1:26:55] those priests who sat away with him away
[1:26:57] with him and on the cross when he shot
[1:27:00] out their lips and things like that when
[1:27:01] he heard him crying my god why is that
[1:27:04] forsaking me they didn't have
[1:27:05] discernment
[1:27:07] see they couldn't discern the spirit
[1:27:09] that's what david was speaking of in the
[1:27:11] 22nd psalm they shot out their lip not
[1:27:13] knowing they were doing it just the same
[1:27:15] as that benjaminite did to david see he
[1:27:17] thought david was all wrong because he
[1:27:19] didn't agree with him on his principles
[1:27:20] of running his kingdom he didn't
[1:27:22] understand that it was the spirit of god
[1:27:24] and david doing it that's where we must
[1:27:26] discern today the spirit of the man
[1:27:28] what's he trying to do what's he getting
[1:27:31] at not what group he belongs to or what
[1:27:33] this that or the other
[1:27:35] whether he's a white man black man
[1:27:36] yellow man or whatever he is let's see
[1:27:38] what he's trying to achieve and take
[1:27:39] that
[1:27:41] see what he's trying to do for the
[1:27:42] kingdom of god he's got odd ideas to
[1:27:44] ours that's perfectly all right if he's
[1:27:46] trying to achieve something for the
[1:27:48] kingdom of god discern that in him if
[1:27:50] he's wrong and true in heart god will
[1:27:52] bring him around to the truth of the
[1:27:53] thing after a while let him alone
[1:27:56] let him alone see what he's trying to do
[1:27:58] now we see here
[1:28:01] then we find out in his in his death
[1:28:03] when he died at the cross and crying all
[1:28:06] the things the prophet spoke of him they
[1:28:08] pierced my hands and my feet there it
[1:28:10] was fulfilled the prophets was right
[1:28:13] they thought it was themselves or cried
[1:28:14] like it was themselves but it was
[1:28:16] manifested in the cross
[1:28:18] he uh he was uh numbered with the
[1:28:20] transgressors
[1:28:22] that's what he was done he was with the
[1:28:23] transgressors in his death he made his
[1:28:26] bureau with the rich he did he was
[1:28:28] buried in a rich man's grave
[1:28:30] i will not leave his soul he will not
[1:28:33] leave my soul said david
[1:28:36] the spirit of god in david speaking out
[1:28:38] he will not leave my soul in hell
[1:28:41] neither will he suffer his holy one to
[1:28:42] see corruption like as if david would be
[1:28:44] the holy one
[1:28:46] it wasn't david it was the spirit of god
[1:28:48] in david crying out
[1:28:50] see the spirit of god in the man crying
[1:28:52] out some of them said listen that old
[1:28:54] hypocrite up there he wasn't it was the
[1:28:56] spirit of god in him crying out see the
[1:28:59] spirit of god manifests itself not leave
[1:29:01] his soul in hell neither will suffer my
[1:29:02] holy one to see corruption now brethren
[1:29:05] and closing may i say this our time gets
[1:29:07] away but look may i say this in closing
[1:29:10] with these scriptures here
[1:29:12] let's see if a man that all the old
[1:29:15] testament theme was about him
[1:29:18] all the holy prophets anointed with
[1:29:20] god's spirit
[1:29:21] if all that and everything that they
[1:29:24] said was fulfilled to the letter exactly
[1:29:27] in him
[1:29:28] surely that great person called the son
[1:29:31] of god ought to know how to set up the
[1:29:33] new testament church yes
[1:29:36] don't you believe that
[1:29:38] he ought to have a conception to know
[1:29:40] how to set up the new testament church
[1:29:42] the first thing i want to call your
[1:29:44] attention over here in matthew 16th
[1:29:46] chapter
[1:29:47] that when he is speaking there when he
[1:29:49] come down was talking to the disciples
[1:29:51] he said who does man say i the son of
[1:29:53] man am
[1:29:56] and they said some say you're elias and
[1:29:58] some say you're so and so and some say
[1:30:00] you're so and so and like that different
[1:30:02] one he said but who do you say that i am
[1:30:06] and peter said thou art the christ the
[1:30:08] son of the living god
[1:30:10] he said blessed art thou simon son of
[1:30:12] jonas for flesh and blood is not
[1:30:14] revealed it's you but my father which is
[1:30:16] in heaven has revealed this to you
[1:30:18] and and i'll say underneath the art
[1:30:20] simon or art peter and upon this rock
[1:30:23] i'll build my church and the gates of
[1:30:25] hell can't prevail against him now there
[1:30:27] we're speaking of the church
[1:30:29] now watch
[1:30:31] closely and if i'm wrong god forgive me
[1:30:33] and you forgive me now the
[1:30:35] catholic church says that that was a
[1:30:38] stone laying there
[1:30:40] peter
[1:30:41] and upon peter he built the church now
[1:30:44] we know that that's wrong we protestants
[1:30:46] disagree with it but we protestant says
[1:30:48] it was himself
[1:30:50] that he built himself a church up on
[1:30:52] himself but if you'll notice i want to
[1:30:55] disagree with that friendly it wasn't
[1:30:57] that it was up on the spiritual
[1:30:59] revelation of himself
[1:31:03] flesh and blood you never learn this in
[1:31:04] a seminary as good as they are
[1:31:07] you never learn this by some church
[1:31:09] creed as good as it is it's all right
[1:31:12] but
[1:31:13] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:31:15] you it's not an intellectual conception
[1:31:17] of how you make your speech how you must
[1:31:19] die yourself how what great thing you
[1:31:21] must do here on earth that isn't what it
[1:31:23] is it isn't build a great thing or do a
[1:31:25] great thing what it is is a revelation
[1:31:28] of the word of god he was the word
[1:31:31] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:31:33] word is with god and the word was god
[1:31:34] and the word was made manifest and dwelt
[1:31:37] among us
[1:31:38] he was that was a revelation of the word
[1:31:41] of god
[1:31:43] the spirit in peter
[1:31:45] revealing by spiritual revelation that
[1:31:48] he was the son of god made manifest
[1:31:51] the god of glory manifesting the glory
[1:31:54] of god
[1:31:55] upon this rock spiritual revelation of
[1:31:59] the word i'll build my church why if
[1:32:02] them prophets was under god
[1:32:05] speaking by the holy spirit that that
[1:32:07] was the son of god the same spirit on
[1:32:09] this side reveals right back the same
[1:32:12] thing
[1:32:14] you see it
[1:32:16] flesh and blood you can't learn it in a
[1:32:18] seminary you learn your get your
[1:32:20] dd and your phd and held here that was
[1:32:23] all right wish you had it
[1:32:25] that's right but still that's not it
[1:32:28] you don't have to have it yet it's good
[1:32:29] to have it
[1:32:31] you can be this plus
[1:32:33] but if you have to rub out the plus take
[1:32:36] this
[1:32:37] this is that
[1:32:39] if this ain't that let me have this
[1:32:41] anyhow i want this
[1:32:45] this
[1:32:46] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:32:48] you
[1:32:50] you never learn it through the
[1:32:51] educational line you never learn through
[1:32:53] denominational lines they're fine
[1:32:55] education denomination is fine that's
[1:32:57] part of it but people are laying too
[1:32:59] much to that and they're leaving the
[1:33:01] spiritual discernment amen
[1:33:03] see
[1:33:04] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:33:06] you but my father which is in heaven has
[1:33:08] revealed this to you
[1:33:10] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:33:14] and the gates of hell can prevail
[1:33:15] against it
[1:33:17] will never be able to prevail show they
[1:33:19] would be against it now watch and see
[1:33:21] where the gates of hell is against
[1:33:24] it ain't against the denomination
[1:33:26] the government recognizes that
[1:33:29] it is the world recognizes our
[1:33:31] denominations all of them
[1:33:33] we have the rights each one of us is
[1:33:35] american citizens we have the rights of
[1:33:37] denomination which is fine we appreciate
[1:33:40] that
[1:33:40] but that's not what the gates of hell is
[1:33:42] against
[1:33:43] it's against the spiritual revelation of
[1:33:46] christ being held out of the same
[1:33:49] destiny today and forever
[1:33:52] that's what it's against
[1:33:55] the gates of hell shall be against it
[1:33:57] but it shall never prevail
[1:34:02] there you are spiritual discernment
[1:34:05] regardless of who it is is my brother as
[1:34:07] long as he's trying to achieve the same
[1:34:09] purpose that i'm working for
[1:34:10] let him be prophet let him be pastor let
[1:34:12] it be deacon let him be so and so let
[1:34:15] god honor him this way that way whatever
[1:34:17] it is disarm me whatever he wants to do
[1:34:18] but yet that's my brother hallelujah
[1:34:21] we're working for the same thing we're
[1:34:23] sending our our all of our works into
[1:34:26] the same kingdom honor he's working for
[1:34:28] the same thing i am spiritual
[1:34:29] discernment spiritual revelation
[1:34:32] of god
[1:34:34] look here if you want jesus i preached
[1:34:36] the other night somewhere
[1:34:37] maybe down there
[1:34:38] it wasn't so from the beginning we have
[1:34:41] to go back to the beginning to find our
[1:34:42] text now for just a moment
[1:34:45] at the beginning there was cain
[1:34:46] intellectual
[1:34:48] build a fine church
[1:34:50] we would say made a fine altar offered
[1:34:52] up a sacrifice prayed sincere gave
[1:34:55] thanks paid his tithes everything just
[1:34:58] as religious as abel was
[1:35:00] but abel
[1:35:01] there was no bible
[1:35:03] in them days but by spiritual revelation
[1:35:07] he seen that it wasn't fruits of the
[1:35:08] field that caused us to sin
[1:35:11] it wasn't apples that they eat
[1:35:15] see it wasn't apples
[1:35:17] revelation told him that
[1:35:19] and it wasn't the fruits that caused him
[1:35:21] to come out of there it was life
[1:35:23] the separation of life so he went and
[1:35:25] got a lamb and offered it in his skin by
[1:35:28] faith which is spiritual revelation
[1:35:31] amen
[1:35:34] the revelation of god
[1:35:36] spiritual revelation it was revealed to
[1:35:38] him it isn't a fruit
[1:35:40] it isn't apples it isn't peaches plums
[1:35:42] and pears
[1:35:44] it was a separation of life
[1:35:46] so he went and got alive and offered it
[1:35:48] instead of fruits
[1:35:50] fruit says watch you your works are your
[1:35:51] own hands what you do there i'll go and
[1:35:53] build this i'll go do this i'll support
[1:35:55] that that's good he had an alternative
[1:35:57] the same as the other did both of them
[1:35:59] had alders that was good but it was a
[1:36:00] real spiritual revealed truth of the
[1:36:03] thing
[1:36:04] where the spirit of god revealed it upon
[1:36:07] that rock the rock that christ died on
[1:36:09] the rock of ages upon the rock that
[1:36:12] abel's lamb died on
[1:36:14] that little abel as he put his hands
[1:36:17] upon that little lamb and his little
[1:36:19] white wolf being bathed as he took a a
[1:36:21] rock they didn't have a lance in that
[1:36:23] day and chop this little neck like that
[1:36:25] and hammered it and the poor little
[1:36:26] thing dying the blood bathing his hands
[1:36:28] and his little wool old babe was bloody
[1:36:31] blading and crying what did he speak of
[1:36:34] the lamb of god some four thousand years
[1:36:36] later spiritually revealed the church
[1:36:39] turning him down and the people called
[1:36:41] him beelzebub and a devil because all
[1:36:44] the prophets that spoke out they denied
[1:36:46] the prophets always said you build their
[1:36:48] suffolkers and you put them in there you
[1:36:50] wanted walls he said to them without
[1:36:53] spiritual discernment not knowing that
[1:36:54] that was the lamb of god that he was
[1:36:56] supposed to be that way and act that way
[1:36:58] because he was fulfilling the word of
[1:37:00] god and the holy ghost church today
[1:37:02] acting the way they do doing the things
[1:37:04] to do they're fulfilling the word of god
[1:37:06] hallelujah
[1:37:07] you see peter said on the day of
[1:37:09] pentecost this is that
[1:37:14] and he said it's unto you and to your
[1:37:16] children and them that's far off even as
[1:37:18] many as the lord our god shall call them
[1:37:20] same inspired prophet said the evening
[1:37:22] light would shine there would be a
[1:37:23] former ladder rain together
[1:37:26] as in the days of grace looking here
[1:37:27] what is it the farmer rains coming over
[1:37:30] and the latter rain is past you then
[1:37:32] it's left over it's to gather the former
[1:37:34] ladder reign together the holy spirit
[1:37:37] may manifest by the power and the
[1:37:39] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:37:41] there you are
[1:37:43] coming together the farmer god's grace
[1:37:46] he said as it was the days of noah his
[1:37:48] grace was long suffering here it is

[1:41:17] days as it said as it was in the days of
[1:41:18] sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:41:20] the son of man there's a revelation
[1:41:22] written in mysteries like this to the
[1:41:24] outside world to the world it knows
[1:41:26] about but you precious brethren you
[1:41:29] precious sisters you are not children of

[1:41:33] night but your children are the light
[1:41:36] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:41:38] light then we have fellowship one with
[1:41:40] another while the blood of jesus christ
[1:41:42] god's son cleanses all our sins from all
[1:41:45] of us

[1:43:00] different one from another but there was
[1:43:01] a one father
[1:43:03] and they should work to one thing and
[1:43:04] they rejected the main one in there
