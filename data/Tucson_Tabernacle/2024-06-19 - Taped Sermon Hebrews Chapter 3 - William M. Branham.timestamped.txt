[15:09] that whether he lived or not he wanted
[15:12] to fully consecrate his life to the Lord
[15:15] and he he
[15:16] um began to stand on the Promises of
[15:19] healing determined to believe no matter
[15:22] what his physical condition no matter

[38:44] were welcomed by our youth and they were
[38:47] just they they were really happy they

[39:01] that was like 17 and um they were uh
[39:06] they were they were just enjoying it and
[39:09] and they started talking with me and
[39:11] they started giving me testimonies about
[39:13] how the Lord had worked in their life
[39:15] and and I think that they appreciated it
[39:17] that I would listen and I cared and I
[39:20] saw the Lord working in these boys lives
[39:23] I want to share a testimony of this
[39:24] young man he he said that I said so tell

[39:37] from Texas believe and one of them was
[39:40] from Utah and they were here in Tucson
[39:43] on their mission and they do a two-year
[39:45] Mission and the young man told me I said
[39:49] I said tell me I want to hear what the

[42:47] Christ that I know and and I do
[42:50] appreciate young men like that serving

[45:36] one built and it didn't fit it was
[45:39] causing a lot of a lot of pain and the

[47:20] flood and it has come in the enemy is

[47:26] that he's got and he's hitting our young
[47:28] people with with things that have never
[47:30] been on the face of the Earth and
[47:32] they're here and God has raising up a
[47:35] standard of Youth against them I'm proud
[47:38] of our kids and I know that they can
[47:40] make it through and they need our
[47:43] prayers I stand with them how many here

[52:12] start from the 15th chapter 15th verse
[52:15] of the third chapter closely now while
[52:18] it is said today if you hear his voice
[52:21] Harden not your hearts as in the
[52:25] provocation I watch watch Paul speaking
[52:27] here I said today after so long a time
[52:30] we're going to get into it after while
[52:32] that today so long a time comes into the
[52:34] next
[52:35] chapter after so long a time it is said
[52:39] today if you hear his voice Harden not
[52:42] your hearts as in the day of provocation
[52:44] when they provoke God now let's read the
[52:46] next verse for some when they had
[52:49] heard did provoke now what's he talking
[52:52] about
[52:54] gospel how be it not all that came out
[52:57] of Egypt by Moses but with whom he was
[53:01] grieved for 40 years was it not with
[53:04] them that is sin whose carcasses fell in
[53:07] the wilderness and stop here a minute
[53:10] the provocation when they provoke now
[53:13] what did God do now Paul's trying to
[53:15] speak what is it led them out of Egypt
[53:17] was it Moses No Moses was the flesh
[53:23] instrument now we' got a background here
[53:25] we want to get straightened out now when
[53:28] we hit this spot down here in a few
[53:29] minutes you you'll see it now God had
[53:32] his people with unsettled
[53:34] rest they were down in Egypt they were
[53:36] out of the right position they were out
[53:38] of their homelands they were strangers
[53:40] and pilgrims and God was going to bring
[53:43] them from that housed in place in in
[53:46] Egypt up to the
[53:49] Homeland a type of today we're
[53:54] unsettled here it don't take long little
[53:58] chubby handed boys playing Marvels
[54:01] little girls with the dollies playing
[54:04] the first thing you know you got gray
[54:06] hair and wrinkled it
[54:08] up there's something wrong here this is
[54:10] not
[54:12] home we're in the wrong
[54:15] place that's why we say we are pilgrims
[54:19] and
[54:21] strangers Something's Happened
[54:27] a little lady said this morning in the
[54:28] room about how people laugh at her
[54:31] sometime I said but sister dear you're
[54:33] not out them
[54:36] people we are a different people my
[54:40] little girl said uh daddy certain
[54:42] certain girls did certain certain things
[54:45] that they did I said but look
[54:47] honey they had these records of Elvis
[54:50] Presley I said I wouldn't want them in
[54:52] my
[54:54] house she said but Daddy there ni little
[54:56] girls I said they may
[54:58] be I have nothing to say against that
[55:02] but there's one thing we are
[55:06] different we are different not is that
[55:09] we want to be different but the spirit
[55:14] that's within us has come out of
[55:18] that you're of another
[55:21] world when I go into Africa I can't get
[55:25] adjusted to their their their ways of
[55:27] living they don't wear any clothes
[55:29] they're
[55:30] naked and they pick up something that's
[55:33] rotten got magot they eat it anyhow
[55:36] don't make any difference see I this is
[55:42] different you know one time we were all
[55:44] like that but civilization has brought
[55:48] us to made us
[55:49] different and conversion has doubled
[55:52] that by
[55:54] millions we don't want the rotten things
[55:57] of the world no
[55:59] more Christ has made us become
[56:02] Christians amen like Civilization has
[56:05] made us become
[56:08] clean and notice not only
[56:12] that but we profess that we're pilgrims
[56:16] and
[56:17] strangers we're not all the world then
[56:20] you want nothing to do with the world
[56:23] and those things has passed away now
[56:26] Israel was down in Egypt they wasn't
[56:29] Egyptians Egyptians it was a disgrace
[56:33] for an Egyptian to put his hands on a
[56:36] sheep and Israel were sheep
[56:40] herders and how must it got
[56:43] Moses after all the Dignity of being an
[56:47] Egyptian cattle
[56:49] raisers did you notice what the Pharaoh
[56:52] had said to Joseph and so forth it is an
[56:55] abom Nation said your people are sheep
[56:59] herders and even Egyptian couldn't even
[57:01] put his hands on a sheep
[57:03] herder he was a different
[57:06] people and that's what it is with a
[57:08] Christian today when he's born again
[57:10] it's not it's filthy for him to sociate
[57:14] where people are drinking and telling
[57:16] dirty jokes and women naked and every
[57:20] it's it's
[57:22] fness oh bless be the Lord we are
[57:26] pilgrims here we're strangers
[57:30] here the spirit has been converted and
[57:33] we're looking for a city where women
[57:36] don't wear
[57:37] shorts we're looking for a city where
[57:39] they don't have fear
[57:41] taverns we're looking for a city where
[57:44] IND dwelleth
[57:47] righteousness so we're
[57:49] pilgrims so God came down in a big
[57:52] bundle of fire as of Halo swept down
[57:56] into a bush and begin to reveal himself
[57:58] to Moses
[58:01] first Moses said you know how we had the
[58:03] lesson the other night how that when
[58:05] Jesus was here on Earth he said well
[58:07] before Moses was I
[58:09] am that was Jesus in the burning bush in
[58:13] the pillar of
[58:16] fire it's Jesus
[58:20] today the
[58:22] same and he revealed himself in a pillar
[58:25] of Fire and Moses got the
[58:28] experience he goes down into Egypt he
[58:31] preaches the gospel the good news and
[58:35] signs and wonders follow
[58:37] him you get it same thing
[58:41] today not only that but when them
[58:43] Hebrews come out walked in the light
[58:46] they was led by the same Pillar of
[58:49] Fire and the Bible said that do not
[58:52] tempt God watch this let me read it
[58:56] while it is said today if you hear his
[58:58] voice Harden not your heart his voice
[59:00] speaking to your heart as in the
[59:04] provocation when they provoked him
[59:06] listen for some when they had heard did
[59:11] provoke how many knows that the
[59:13] Israelites provoke god with their
[59:14] unbelief amen they murmured they
[59:17] completely God walked right down there
[59:19] when he got out first thing they got in
[59:21] trouble here was this pillar fire above
[59:23] them I don't know where they all saw it
[59:25] or not at least Moses saw it and it was
[59:28] above them and they watched it and when
[59:31] they come down say it they didn't see it
[59:33] I don't know whether they did or not it
[59:35] went before him the Bible said it was
[59:37] there it said the star went before the
[59:39] wise man nobody saw it but the wise man
[59:42] it went over every Observatory they kept
[59:44] time to the Stars no one saw it but the
[59:46] wise man it was far them to see it and
[59:50] the wise man was who the star was sent
[59:53] for amen and the pillar of fire was sent
[59:55] to to Moses and Moses was sent to the
[59:58] children of Israel amen and they're
[1:00:00] supposed to follow Moses they could see
[1:00:02] Moses and Moses Saw The
[1:00:04] Light there they went they were leading
[1:00:08] and as they went out they come to the
[1:00:11] Red Sea all the seen all those signs of
[1:00:14] Miracles and things taking place while
[1:00:15] they were still down in the in the old
[1:00:17] land of Egypt but when they got out
[1:00:19] there in their Journey just converted
[1:00:21] and brought out then the first thing you
[1:00:24] know they got in trouble God loves to
[1:00:26] bring you in trouble he loves to put
[1:00:28] trouble down and see what you'll do
[1:00:30] about
[1:00:31] it so he just stopped up the Red Sea and
[1:00:34] the first thing old Mar him right out
[1:00:35] into this place then sent Pharaoh after
[1:00:38] him see how God likes to do it he loves
[1:00:41] to display his power and love he's God
[1:00:46] and he just loves to show you who he
[1:00:49] is
[1:00:51] amen and the trouble of it is today
[1:00:53] people say all them days is passed no
[1:00:55] how can God display himself when you're
[1:00:58] taught such stuff as that but God loves
[1:01:01] to manifest himself here come the
[1:01:03] children of Israel walking in the light
[1:01:06] Moses going on before them there us come
[1:01:09] on this is the way God's calling we're
[1:01:11] going out we're going to the promised
[1:01:14] land oh Hallelujah there they all was
[1:01:16] shouting and jumping and having a good
[1:01:18] time you know and the first thing you
[1:01:19] know they looked back and said oh what's
[1:01:21] that dust one of them climbed up on the
[1:01:23] hill said oh alas alas it's pharaoh
[1:01:26] Army God said what you so scared
[1:01:29] about didn't you believe what I did down
[1:01:33] there what's you so worried
[1:01:36] about why you make me
[1:01:39] angry when he got down there Moses cl

[1:05:13] what why are they provoking me Father

[1:05:46] something about this water what do you
[1:05:47] make me angry
[1:05:48] about oh your unbelief you provoke me to
[1:05:53] anger because of unbelief now the word
[1:05:56] here is you sin provoked made reason
[1:06:00] they did it they disbelieved they never
[1:06:02] went out and got the shooting craps now
[1:06:03] and things like that they never run
[1:06:05] around with somebody else's wife and
[1:06:07] went out and told lies that wasn't what
[1:06:09] they were doing but that's not sin to
[1:06:11] begin with living in adultery is not sin
[1:06:15] smoking chewing drinking gambling
[1:06:17] cursing swearing so forth that's not sin
[1:06:20] that's the attributes of unbelief you do
[1:06:24] that because you're an unbeliever if you
[1:06:26] are a Believer you don't do that that's
[1:06:28] the reason she said he that Hearth my
[1:06:29] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:06:31] has everlasting life not says he
[1:06:33] believes but really
[1:06:34] believes there it is that takes all your
[1:06:37] initial evidence away see there you are
[1:06:41] not he that Hearth my words that
[1:06:43] shouts not he that Hearth my words that
[1:06:45] speaks with tongues not he Hearth my
[1:06:48] words that has blood in his hand or in
[1:06:50] his face or whatever more that's not it
[1:06:53] he that Hearth my words and believeth on
[1:06:56] him and S me has eternal life and shall
[1:06:59] never come to the Judgment but pass him
[1:07:01] death to life what he see unbelief a
[1:07:04] little something can raise up instead of
[1:07:06] going right to the scripture and find
[1:07:07] out where it's true or not oh he
[1:07:10] said you go ahead I'm just continue a
[1:07:12] presbyterian like I am see go ahead
[1:07:17] blind and you provoke God when God does
[1:07:20] anything he expects the nation to grab
[1:07:23] it but instead of that you oh well I
[1:07:26] don't know about that see he expects the
[1:07:28] people to get it if you're concerned us
[1:07:30] sit down with the scripture go through
[1:07:31] it and search it back and forth and see
[1:07:33] if it happen if it's predicted to come
[1:07:35] to pass and so forth then you'll get
[1:07:38] it amen now
[1:07:41] notice while it is today if you hear his
[1:07:43] voice Harden not your
[1:07:45] heart as in the provocation when God was
[1:07:48] provoked with him you see for some when
[1:07:51] they had heard heard the gospel Moses
[1:07:53] preached did provoke how be it not all
[1:07:56] that came out of Egypt by Moses how many
[1:07:59] knows how many people saved out of that
[1:08:01] original bunch and come out how many two
[1:08:04] is right how many those are
[1:08:07] names that's right Caleb and Joshua the
[1:08:10] only two out of two million
[1:08:12] something listen to
[1:08:15] this but

[1:13:03] they seen it Paul trying to get they
[1:13:04] later on get down here the experience
[1:13:06] that he had see trying to relate this
[1:13:08] experience en tighten it to the Old

[1:13:11] a new thing to this new dispensation by
[1:13:15] Jesus Christ old times the Lord appeared
[1:13:18] to him by the prophets but now he's by
[1:13:20] his son Jesus see and he will begin to

[1:14:10] it you won't listen to it oh you say my
[1:14:14] church don't teach that as long as the
[1:14:16] Bible teaches it and God proves it

[1:15:18] us let us therefore fear less a
[1:15:22] promise now do they have a promise to
[1:15:25] the promised land down in Egypt and when
[1:15:29] God came down to make this promise a
[1:15:33] reality why God told Abraham hundreds
[1:15:38] and hundreds of years before that he's
[1:15:40] going to do it it was
[1:15:41] scriptural Joseph said don't you move my
[1:15:44] bones from here until you go to that
[1:15:47] promised land and bury me up there the
[1:15:48] rest of my fathers because you know the
[1:15:50] resurrection was coming when Jesus rose
[1:15:52] from the dead because he know what job
[1:15:54] said see each one of them prophets
[1:15:56] though just what the other Prophet had
[1:15:57] said and know that their Spirit was the
[1:15:58] same and they was
[1:16:00] watching oh
[1:16:03] brother Bo that hard shake us out of our
[1:16:06] word condition they had their eyes I
[1:16:09] know what people are saying but what
[1:16:10] them Prophet said each one of them was
[1:16:13] watching Abraham said bear me right here
[1:16:15] where job was bearing said Sarah I'm
[1:16:18] going to buy a piece of ground we're
[1:16:19] going to be buried right here Isaac was
[1:16:21] a prophet after his daddy said listen
[1:16:23] don't you bury me anywhere else not down
[1:16:24] here in Egypt but you take me right back
[1:16:26] in the promised land you bury me right
[1:16:28] here Jacob died down a Promised Land but
[1:16:30] said to his son who was a prophet said
[1:16:32] you one night the angel touched me on
[1:16:34] the side and I've Lim every sin come put
[1:16:36] your
[1:16:37] hand oh mercy my Prophet son I'm old and
[1:16:42] I'm
[1:16:43] blind but put your holy hand in a
[1:16:46] prophet yourself lay it on the place
[1:16:48] where the angel had his hand and swear
[1:16:50] to the god of Heaven that you'll not
[1:16:51] bear me down
[1:16:53] here bless
[1:16:55] do you see the spiritual revelation of
[1:16:57] the
[1:16:58] word well half of to 90% didn't know
[1:17:01] what he's talking about but he knew what
[1:17:03] he was talking about put your Prophet
[1:17:06] hands on this place where the angel laid
[1:17:08] his hand I was once a big Stout man a
[1:17:11] robust coward but he touched me and
[1:17:13] since then I've been a liing man but
[1:17:15] I've been a prince ever since I lied
[1:17:18] ever since I changed my way of walking
[1:17:19] I've been a
[1:17:21] prince hallu yes but your hand your
[1:17:24] wherever the god of Heaven you not bury
[1:17:26] me here why no one know what he was
[1:17:28] talking about Joseph did he said take me
[1:17:31] up and bury me in that Promise Land
[1:17:34] there's where was that certainly when
[1:17:37] Joseph died years later he said don't
[1:17:40] you bury me down
[1:17:42] here but you look at my bones when you
[1:17:44] pass by CU someday you're going out of
[1:17:47] here and when you go take my bones with
[1:17:52] you there you are let the world say what
[1:17:55] they want to and do what they want do
[1:17:57] blessed be the name of the Lord Keep Me
[1:17:59] In Christ if I'm called anything uh
[1:18:03] fanatic or holy ruler someday he's
[1:18:06] coming and those that are in Christ will
[1:18:09] God bring with him when he comes it's
[1:18:12] all a spiritual revealed truth laying
[1:18:16] right there and it takes a spiritual
[1:18:17] mind to catch
[1:18:18] it rest on that through the day think of
[1:18:22] it even if you do without your dinner
[1:18:24] think of it and tonight we'll go into
[1:18:26] his rest that was left and see what this
[1:18:28] promise is today what is this thing
[1:18:30] today if God has got here the Bible and
[1:18:33] prove it it's right here now then I'm a
[1:18:36] false prophet that's exactly right but
[1:18:39] it's here what is this rest he said now
[1:18:42] let us Fearless a promise being left us
[1:18:44] to enter in just like they did and it's
[1:18:46] got to be the same promise it's got to
[1:18:48] be the same rest it's got to be the same
[1:18:51] God it's got to be the same signs it's
[1:18:54] got to be the same same thing let us
[1:18:56] stress out what is it may the Lord grant
[1:18:59] it to us tonight while we bow our heads
[1:19:01] blessed
[1:19:02] Lord only eternity will
[1:19:05] reveal the great things that we now
[1:19:09] share
[1:19:11] together little as many who are ordained
[1:19:14] to
[1:19:15] condemnation as thou has said in the
[1:19:17] book of Jude that man of old for our
[1:19:20] dained to condemnation would take the
[1:19:23] grace of our God and turn it into
[1:19:26] lasciviousness and many they are
[1:19:28] preaching the
[1:19:30] gospel the grace of God turn it into a
[1:19:33] money-making
[1:19:35] scheme having a great big church for the
[1:19:37] most in Sunday
[1:19:39] school taking the grace of God and turn
[1:19:42] it into
[1:19:45] lishness and the world's blind going
[1:19:48] like blind
[1:19:50] pigs they don't
[1:19:52] understand oh God open to us
[1:19:56] understanding let our understanding not
[1:19:59] be like the children of this world for
[1:20:01] thou has said in thy word that the
[1:20:03] children of this world are wiser than
[1:20:05] the children of the
[1:20:07] light in the beginning it was so the
[1:20:10] children of Cain become great Master
[1:20:14] scientists they become great
[1:20:17] Educators they become workers of
[1:20:21] material they went on progressing very
[1:20:23] religious
[1:20:26] but was condemned and drowned in the
[1:20:30] judgment and their carcasses floated on
[1:20:32] their water and their souls went to hell
[1:20:36] and Jesus went and spoke to him when he
[1:20:39] died and went to hell and preached to
[1:20:40] the souls that was in prison that
[1:20:42] repented not in the Longs suffering of
[1:20:44] the days of Noah sayith the
[1:20:47] scripture and God as he stood on Earth
[1:20:50] he said as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:20:52] would it be in the coming of the son of
[1:20:54] man man but we notice the lineage then
[1:20:57] of Seth humble
[1:21:00] man real man of God not knowing too much
[1:21:04] of the things of the world caring
[1:21:06] nothing for the things of the world but
[1:21:08] have laid aside every weight and to
[1:21:11] believe God and become prophets and
[1:21:13] great man in the Kingdom while the
[1:21:15] others the other religious World laughed
[1:21:18] at him made fun of them but the hour
[1:21:21] come when the floods and judgment came
[1:21:23] so wasn't the coming of Jesus Christ how
[1:21:27] they laughed and made fun of him while
[1:21:28] they had their own religions in their
[1:21:30] great churches but they made fun of the
[1:21:33] morning
[1:21:34] star and they laughed at him but yet
[1:21:38] they entered into judgment and when they
[1:21:40] flee and went into the Jerusalem there
[1:21:44] they eat their own children from
[1:21:45] starvation and their blood run out the
[1:21:48] street Gates when they burnt the city in
[1:21:50] the temple and their souls went into
[1:21:53] hell Lord here we are again on the
[1:21:56] 3D this is a lifetime three is the
[1:21:59] number of life here we are ready for the
[1:22:02] Rapture the church moving on the great
[1:22:06] scientist world the church is today
[1:22:07] sitting full of skeptic
[1:22:10] Believers tens of thousands with their
[1:22:12] names on the book yes
[1:22:14] millions and would laugh at the
[1:22:18] gospel and say that they're uneducated
[1:22:21] they don't know maybe that's so Lord but
[1:22:25] what we La in education you make up in
[1:22:28] Grace but sending your angel of
[1:22:32] Light by manifesting his power
[1:22:36] confirming the words to those who are
[1:22:38] poor and illiterate as we but we love
[1:22:42] you for this because it's the grace of
[1:22:44] God that has did it and we know that we
[1:22:47] were born and we're not lovely at
[1:22:50] all we're very unlovely but thou through
[1:22:54] Grace reached down thy merciful hand and
[1:22:58] it's opened our eyes as Jesus prayed for
[1:23:02] us as Elijah did for Gaza as he looked
[1:23:05] to see around him and today our eyes are
[1:23:09] open and we see the things of God and
[1:23:12] know we're moving at the end time when
[1:23:14] the Gentile people's days are about
[1:23:16] finished and he'll take up people for
[1:23:17] his name let us be included there Lord
[1:23:20] humbly we beg we pray that you'll Grant
[1:23:23] it bless this bless this little audience
[1:23:26] this morning they're made up of all
[1:23:28] different types of religions and beliefs
[1:23:31] but lay them aside today God and may
[1:23:33] they look straight towards Calvary say
[1:23:36] God mold me and make me I'm like the the
[1:23:39] prophet said that he went out to The
[1:23:41] Potter's House that he might be broke up
[1:23:43] and remolded mold us and make us after
[1:23:46] the passion that God would have us no
[1:23:48] matter if we had to be the floor matat
[1:23:51] at the house of the Lord I'd rather be
[1:23:53] the doormat than to dwell in tense with
[1:23:56] the wicked in Grant it Lord just bless
[1:23:59] us now and keep us humble let our hearts
[1:24:01] be open our minds clear to the things of
[1:24:04] God for we ask it in Christ's name with
[1:24:07] our heads bowed I wonder if someone
[1:24:09] would want to be remembered in a word of
[1:24:11] prayer for your salvation of your soul
[1:24:14] would you raise your hand to this is
[1:24:16] sinner God bless you young fell someone
[1:24:18] else God bless you back there sir God
[1:24:20] bless you lady someone else like to be
[1:24:23] remembered in prayer just now for your
[1:24:24] soul God bless you Sarah with your hand
[1:24:26] up and God bless you and you here
[1:24:30] wonderful would there be another just
[1:24:32] before closing I feel it be God bless
[1:24:34] you back there sir in the back say now
[1:24:36] look I want to ask you something I don't
[1:24:38] want you to think it all because it's
[1:24:40] this little Tabernacle I don't want you
[1:24:42] to think it's because it's this people
[1:24:44] and merciful god don't think it's
[1:24:46] because that the angel of the Lord had
[1:24:47] his picture take with me and I and and
[1:24:50] St of that to do that oh God if I felt
[1:24:52] that way then brother I need to be the
[1:24:54] altar instead of asking you but I'm only
[1:24:57] saying this I'm only saying this by the
[1:25:00] scripture that you'll see that this is
[1:25:02] the truth if I said it and that's all
[1:25:05] there was to it went on like any other
[1:25:06] preacher or something other or any other
[1:25:08] well then it would be different but you
[1:25:10] see the thing God comes right back
[1:25:12] around and proves it it's the truth see
[1:25:14] that's what makes it real is God proving
[1:25:16] it and then not only that but his word
[1:25:18] says that he'll do it here he is doing
[1:25:20] it now if you're not in the right your
[1:25:22] heart's not right with God would you
[1:25:24] just just raise your hand say pray for
[1:25:26] me all right right where you are about
[1:25:29] eight or 10 hands has been up wanting
[1:25:32] Mercy for their soul while you have your
[1:25:34] heads bowed now you pray remember you're
[1:25:37] the one to repent I'm only asking for
[1:25:40] you that God will be merciful but that's
[1:25:42] the altar God has brought you to a place
[1:25:45] in your mind that's the altar we believe
[1:25:48] in coming to the altar sure but that
[1:25:51] doesn't that doesn't it it's all right
[1:25:53] but your real alar
[1:25:55] is where God's met you and he's met you
[1:25:57] right where you're sitting that's your
[1:25:59] altar now I say God be merciful me a
[1:26:02] sinner and from this day on if you'll
[1:26:03] help me I'll live for you I I'll serve
[1:26:06] you I don't care what anyone say I'm
[1:26:08] stepping out this morning I'm praying
[1:26:10] right here and you take this old sassy
[1:26:12] spirit away from me you take this temper
[1:26:14] away from me I know I can't act like
[1:26:17] that and be right with God and I got
[1:26:20] hatred in my heart I'm jealous I got
[1:26:22] malice I got this that ticket without
[1:26:24] God I don't want to be like that make me
[1:26:26] sweet and humble and meat make me gentle
[1:26:29] make me such a person I can win others
[1:26:31] to you let me do something for you to
[1:26:33] show appreciations of my life that's the
[1:26:35] prayer you pray now while we pray
