[34:28] another opportunity to
[34:29] [Music]
[34:32] look into the word of god and to have
[34:36] god
[34:38] [Music]
[34:40] speak to our hearts
[34:48] just keep playing sis i just
[34:50] [Music]
[34:54] i've been so touched by
[34:58] hearing some of the prayers prayed and
[35:02] [Music]
[35:05] being with believers and
[35:08] i'm not a real old man but
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] as i get older that
[35:16] universal family of god
[35:20] gets so rich to me
[35:23] [Music]
[35:25] that god give us a family
[35:29] it's more than just us here
[35:32] you have experienced that life that
[35:37] you get help all along the road
[35:42] i told the sister that
[35:45] i would have never dreamed that when i
[35:49] stood there as a boy maybe 19 or 20
[35:55] on the front row because that's where
[35:58] brother perry thought the young man
[35:59] needed to be right there
[36:02] [Music]
[36:05] and he believed also that they should
[36:06] have a white wall well i didn't know
[36:08] what a white
[36:09] white walls were until i got one
[36:14] i thought my hair was okay but
[36:20] but i would have never dreamed
[36:23] and i tell it for the glory of the lord
[36:25] and i tell it especially to you young
[36:27] people
[36:28] [Music]
[36:30] you seem like you struggle and you don't
[36:32] know what to do next and get so
[36:35] desperate
[36:38] one time i was in the forest
[36:42] dug my hands down in the dirt as i was
[36:45] praying and i said lord what are you
[36:47] gonna do with me i'm just a
[36:50] bunch of dirt so desperate for his
[36:54] direction
[36:55] and a little thought come to me what do
[36:57] you do with a handful of dirt you
[36:59] you put a seed in it
[37:01] [Music]
[37:04] but i told the sister who would uh would
[37:06] i ever dream that i'd go
[37:08] from there to that back office there you
[37:10] know
[37:11] i thought when i was praying this
[37:12] morning i thought lord that's so ironic
[37:15] that here i am praying back in the
[37:18] office there and the lord's let us go
[37:20] around the world and
[37:22] see so many blood washed saints and
[37:24] their testimonies and
[37:27] some of the brothers know those things
[37:28] to see how precious those saints are
[37:33] there's a home coming
[37:38] there's a homecoming and brother branham
[37:40] loved that
[37:41] [Music]
[37:44] poem that said of longfellow and he said
[37:50] i can't remember the verse exactly that
[37:52] says with a heart
[37:54] for any fate
[37:58] with a heart for any faith we don't know
[38:01] what
[38:02] god will have but we're going to meet it
[38:05] by his grace
[38:06] whatever it is and when this is over
[38:12] we're going to a place where the prophet
[38:14] said
[38:15] every wrong will be righted
[38:19] how's god going to do that
[38:23] [Music]
[38:25] it's not going to get white washed it's
[38:27] not going to get swept under the
[38:29] carpet every wrong will be righted
[38:33] [Music]
[38:35] and he went there and i believe it he
[38:38] saw
[38:39] beyond the curtain of time
[38:41] [Music]
[38:44] so great to be part of his family
[38:48] [Music]
[38:49] let's just bow our heads before we
[38:53] approach
[38:53] the word of god
[38:57] heavenly father we're so thankful for
[38:59] these moments
[39:00] together lord to open our hearts to you
[39:04] lord
[39:09] lord to allow ourselves to be broken
[39:12] down
[39:14] to see our own littleness and our
[39:16] failures
[39:20] and to learn to forgive lord
[39:24] help us to learn to forgive
[39:29] heal press on
[39:36] with the price clear
[39:39] before eyes we worship you tonight
[39:46] a little girl sang that song so pretty
[39:49] when the sun goes down let me be
[39:54] praising
[39:55] [Music]
[39:59] let it be today and let it be so in our
[40:02] life lord
[40:04] we love you and as we approach your word
[40:06] we commit our hearts
[40:09] to you in jesus name amen
[40:14] amen i like to read a portion of
[40:18] job while you're standing and
[40:24] this morning
[40:27] we mentioned job and
[40:33] you know the word of god always
[40:36] challenges us to believe
[40:45] and paul in the book of hebrews
[40:50] he explained about the children of
[40:52] israel and
[40:57] he said that they couldn't enter into
[41:01] the promised land because of
[41:04] unbelief
[41:10] and the scripture talks about
[41:13] job being a righteous man and
[41:17] loving god and then it
[41:20] tells how satan said that you have a
[41:25] hedge built around him and that's why
[41:29] he serves you like he does because
[41:32] you know life's good for job
[41:36] and then in the
[41:40] end of the first chapter it gives a list
[41:43] of the things that happened to job
[41:48] through
[41:51] verse 14 to
[41:54] 20 in the first chapter of job
[41:58] messenger came and said that all his
[42:00] sheep and his animals were
[42:02] destroyed
[42:06] and all his good stolen and then it says
[42:09] that his
[42:14] whole family was dining in the house and
[42:17] in verse number 19 and behold there came
[42:21] a great wind from the wilderness
[42:25] and smote the four corners of the house
[42:28] and it fell upon the young men and they
[42:30] are dead
[42:32] and i
[42:36] and i only and escaped alone
[42:39] to tell thee the scripture says one
[42:42] messenger came and said you've
[42:45] you've lost your
[42:48] animals and the other messenger come and
[42:51] said you've lost all your
[42:53] servants and the other messenger came
[42:56] and
[42:56] it says while that messenger was
[42:58] speaking another
[43:00] messenger came
[43:03] and what we believe as believers is this
[43:06] is not a story
[43:08] it's not a dramatization but it's
[43:12] the truth and that's what this man went
[43:15] through
[43:16] and i'd like to read this before we uh
[43:19] speak this evening verse
[43:24] 20.
[43:28] then job arose and rent his mantle
[43:32] and shaved his head and fell down upon
[43:35] the ground
[43:36] and worshipped
[43:41] and said naked came i out of my mother's
[43:44] womb
[43:46] and naked shall i return hither
[43:49] the lord gave and the lord hath taken
[43:52] away
[43:53] blessed be the name of the lord
[43:58] and in all of this job sinned not nor
[44:01] charged the lord foolishly may the lord
[44:05] add his blessings to his word you may be
[44:08] seated
[44:15] we were speaking this morning about man
[44:20] and how that god knew
[44:24] what was in man and god
[44:27] knew what was in job
[44:31] and this was job's
[44:35] spontaneous gut reaction
[44:39] to the providence of god
[44:44] that he fell on his face
[44:47] and worshiped god
[44:52] and he spoke a simple truth
[44:55] that naked i came into the world
[45:05] and naked shall i return thither
[45:12] and it's the truth that job had
[45:15] buried in his heart
[45:19] that allowed him to stand because this
[45:22] is in fact the truth
[45:28] and it's some very basic truths that
[45:30] many
[45:31] times because of the fullness that of
[45:34] life that god gives to us
[45:38] it's very ironic
[45:42] if i saw a man today
[45:46] i couldn't speak to him i seen the tears
[45:49] flowing out of his eyes
[45:52] and i said now i'm not a medical person
[45:55] i'm not a psychologist
[45:58] but alls i could see was tears
[46:01] flooding out of that man's eyes looked
[46:04] like he was suffering
[46:05] and i didn't know if it was from drugs
[46:08] or or
[46:09] a pain in his stomach or what but i
[46:11] couldn't speak to him
[46:14] but i know that if a man is addicted to
[46:18] drugs
[46:19] and and he went that way and having
[46:22] spoken to some of these men
[46:24] at length a man that was delivered from
[46:28] heroin
[46:28] and that we got an opportunity to
[46:32] know in bulgaria
[46:36] your life is is empty of
[46:39] everything except this
[46:43] addiction to this substance
[46:47] and that's as big as your world is this
[46:50] man
[46:50] expressed to me he said that that's that
[46:52] was my world
[46:56] and
[47:00] then god takes us
[47:04] from nothing and job expressed this
[47:08] in his sorrows he said why didn't i die
[47:12] at birth when he was really
[47:15] down and out and it brings
[47:18] to light you know the things that that
[47:21] that could happen and job said none of
[47:24] those things happened to me and you know
[47:26] here i
[47:26] am and we read the scripture he finally
[47:29] came to the place he said who is man
[47:31] that you are mindful him
[47:32] why are you testing me like this
[47:36] why can't i get from out from
[47:40] under your attention
[47:43] he he wanted to flee from the attention
[47:46] of god
[47:47] and he looked at himself and he said
[47:49] what is man that
[47:51] that you are mindful of him
[47:55] but not to go off the point that we were
[47:58] making is is that
[47:59] many of our struggles and many of our
[48:02] trials and testings and
[48:06] the consternations that we have and
[48:09] frustrations
[48:10] is because that god has given you
[48:14] such a full life he's given you the
[48:17] fullness of life
[48:18] and we we somehow we don't realize
[48:24] that our problems are first world
[48:27] problems
[48:28] and we use they they use that term in
[48:31] economics
[48:32] if you if you didn't have so much money
[48:35] you wouldn't have so much troubles
[48:41] but let's just not talk about economics
[48:44] let's just talk about the fullness of
[48:46] life and how that
[48:47] god has brought the things
[48:50] of the kingdom of god to your doorstep
[48:54] god has brought conviction to your
[48:57] doorstep
[48:59] and it's the grace of god that leads a
[49:03] man to repentance
[49:05] it's the goodness of god it's his
[49:08] reaching out to man that brings
[49:11] conviction
[49:12] in your life what a wonderful
[49:16] honor to be brought on the carpet
[49:20] by the almighty
[49:24] oh hallelujah what who
[49:27] what is man
[49:32] that god is so mindful that he wants to
[49:35] chasten you
[49:45] and i was telling someone the other day
[49:47] that
[49:49] i'm so thankful when
[49:53] my wife and i and our family went
[49:55] through some very
[49:57] dark times when the lord took
[50:00] our children home we saw
[50:05] just pure love
[50:08] on display just
[50:12] friends and our fellow man and
[50:14] christians
[50:16] displaying the love of god and
[50:19] support and and love and and
[50:24] pureness of heart
[50:29] and how beautiful it was to see that
[50:35] but i wouldn't be telling the whole
[50:38] story
[50:39] if i didn't say that what
[50:42] really brings healing
[50:46] is the truth
[50:49] and god brings you to a place where you
[50:51] have to look
[50:52] into the word of god and recognize
[50:56] some very simple truths and this
[50:59] is something that job had down
[51:03] in his bosom was an
[51:06] unassuming attitude and a revelation
[51:09] that hey
[51:11] i came into this world naked
[51:15] everything that i have everything that
[51:17] was given to me was given to me of god
[51:21] and he rent his clothes
[51:24] but he worshiped
[51:33] i was speaking at easter time in england
[51:37] and
[51:38] we were talking about
[51:42] the resurrection and
[51:46] paul said that the resurrection
[51:50] was sown in dishonor
[52:00] it is sown in weakness
[52:04] it is sown in corruption
[52:09] and i thought it might be a blessing if
[52:10] there's let's do a little
[52:13] bible drill here this evening to help
[52:16] the preacher i looked for that scripture
[52:20] is there someone in the house tonight
[52:22] that can call that scripture
[52:32] that was a real question in a real time
[52:36] of need
[52:44] it is sown in
[52:49] uh that is uh i'm sorry i would really
[52:53] like to get that scripture and i
[52:56] looked for it first corinthians 15.
[53:10] and we were speaking about this morning
[53:12] and i'd like to just take make a little
[53:14] review
[53:16] uh you that were here this morning we
[53:18] were talking about
[53:20] what form man has and
[53:30] let's just before we read that read what
[53:33] brother branham said we
[53:34] felt we didn't have time to read it uh
[53:39] this morning but it seems a little more
[53:43] casual this evening we could take a
[53:44] little time
[53:46] this is in hebrews chapter 2 part 3.
[53:52] now when man become into that body he
[53:55] had
[53:56] control of all the fishes and the fowls
[53:58] and the beasts of the field
[54:00] now that body that he was speaking of
[54:02] was that theophany body
[54:06] and then there was no man to till the
[54:09] soil
[54:11] he done made male and female but there
[54:13] was no man to till the soil
[54:16] then god made man out of the dust of the
[54:18] earth
[54:20] he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee
[54:23] he give him a foot like a bear he give
[54:27] him
[54:27] he made him on the image and on this
[54:30] earthly body is in the image
[54:34] of animal life and it's made out of the
[54:37] same
[54:38] kind of material your body is made
[54:41] just the same kind of material as a
[54:44] horse
[54:45] or a dog or anything like that it's made
[54:48] out of calcium
[54:50] potash petroleum cosmic light
[54:55] your all flesh
[54:59] is like this not not the same flesh
[55:04] it's different flesh but it's made out
[55:06] of the dust of the earth where it come
[55:09] from
[55:10] but the difference between an animal and
[55:13] a man
[55:14] god put a soul in a man
[55:18] and he didn't put it in the animal
[55:20] because
[55:21] the soul that was in the man is that
[55:24] theophany and that's why it's so hard to
[55:28] relate like we were speaking this
[55:30] morning on
[55:31] what we're made out of and we're made
[55:33] out of you know
[55:34] carbon and oxygen and mostly water and
[55:37] we set those things
[55:38] it's very hard for us to relate to that
[55:41] because we're not thinking in that realm
[55:43] because we're
[55:44] so much aware of this
[55:48] that god put in us a soul
[55:53] where we're so much knowing down in our
[55:56] inside
[55:57] that we're more than what the animals
[56:00] are
[56:02] but nevertheless brother branham brought
[56:05] that to our attention
[56:06] and the word of god brings that to our
[56:08] attention as we
[56:10] spoke of this morning
[56:14] and then paul
[56:18] when he's speaking of the resurrection
[56:21] he said but some man will say
[56:23] how are the dead raised up and with what
[56:26] body do they come
[56:31] thou fool that which thou showest is not
[56:35] quickened
[56:36] except it die
[56:40] and that which thou sowest thou sowest
[56:44] not that body that shall be
[56:47] but bear grain it may chance
[56:51] of wheat or of some other grain
[56:55] but god giveth it a body
[56:58] as it hath pleased him and to every seed
[57:02] his own body so let's just stop a moment
[57:04] if that
[57:05] sounds maybe too old english to you
[57:09] it's very simple that when you take a
[57:12] seed
[57:12] maybe it's a tomato plant or any kind of
[57:15] little seed as you did
[57:17] in school and i i know we all brought
[57:20] things home from school
[57:21] and put them on the windowsill and we
[57:24] we were anxious to see we put it in the
[57:27] cup
[57:29] and then we were waiting and waiting to
[57:31] see
[57:32] what would come out of the ground
[57:38] and paul's just simply saying that
[57:42] what you put into the ground
[57:45] is not what comes up
[57:49] but god gives it a body and so you put
[57:52] this little
[57:53] grain of corn in there and up comes this
[57:56] leaf
[57:56] but then god from that little germ
[58:00] and man can't even find where
[58:03] the life is in that germ because you
[58:08] look at the seed and you say well the
[58:10] life's in that seed but as you
[58:12] pull that apart it's it's really the
[58:15] shock
[58:16] that is protecting the pulp
[58:20] there's a little kind of a shell and
[58:22] then under that there's
[58:24] this pope that is not
[58:27] really where the life is at the life is
[58:31] in there inside that pulp in a little
[58:34] germ of life
[58:40] and it's there and now that life god
[58:43] is going to give that life
[58:46] a body
[58:55] and as that life breaks forth
[58:58] this this body that's given to that
[59:02] becomes manifest and and that corn comes
[59:05] up and then
[59:06] the great big leaves and the next thing
[59:08] you know here is this great big stalk
[59:11] taller or bigger than i am and all these
[59:14] branches and all these corn
[59:16] on that well where did that come from
[59:19] god giveth it a body
[59:25] it's just a miracle that we just take
[59:27] for granted you know we don't think
[59:29] about these things
[59:36] you know i was talking to mustafa and
[59:39] wali and a muslim men in an
[59:42] airport in germany and
[59:46] we got to talking about
[59:49] god
[59:52] and i learned a couple of things along
[59:55] the road and
[59:56] i knew that you could just directly go
[59:59] into a
[1:00:00] argument of jesus versus muhammad
[1:00:06] but who cares about that
[1:00:09] they were lovely men they asked to be
[1:00:11] sit at my
[1:00:13] table i said yeah sit down
[1:00:17] and i don't know how we got started but
[1:00:19] i said i gave my heart to god
[1:00:22] when i was 19. the man said
[1:00:25] my that's something you know that's a
[1:00:28] young age most of us it takes a lot
[1:00:31] older
[1:00:34] and then we just became i don't want to
[1:00:37] rehearse this conversation right now but
[1:00:40] one thing led to another just talking
[1:00:43] about god
[1:00:44] and we talked about why is it that man
[1:00:47] goes to
[1:00:48] i guess i'm gonna tell a little bit of
[1:00:49] it
[1:00:51] we got to talking about
[1:00:56] well it was mustafa he was going
[1:00:59] off on telephones how they were ruining
[1:01:02] his family
[1:01:04] that they were ruining his culture
[1:01:08] that he was irate
[1:01:11] about what cell phones were doing
[1:01:14] and how per how he hated them with a
[1:01:16] perfect hatred
[1:01:18] and i thought wow you know you're pretty
[1:01:21] eccentric you know
[1:01:22] and i thought i was bad
[1:01:26] and then we got to talking about society
[1:01:29] and
[1:01:30] how man gets in this condition and
[1:01:34] we got to talking about that no matter
[1:01:37] in
[1:01:38] what you believe that the law cannot
[1:01:41] hold you
[1:01:43] and it didn't work for the jews
[1:01:46] and it didn't work for the muhammadans
[1:01:49] and it don't work for the christians
[1:01:53] the law can't hold you and we just sat
[1:01:55] there and fellowshipped about that that
[1:01:57] it didn't matter
[1:01:58] what you believed law couldn't hold you
[1:02:01] because you're just talking about how
[1:02:03] nobody respects the law and nobody
[1:02:06] respects the word of god and you know
[1:02:07] that's why we're in this condition
[1:02:09] and i i asked him i said well you know
[1:02:11] what is it in man that
[1:02:12] you that he can love god i said now you
[1:02:15] know what about the people that do love
[1:02:17] god and fail
[1:02:21] and i said what is that in man that
[1:02:26] can love god like that in and then do
[1:02:30] the wrong things and i said we're grown
[1:02:33] men
[1:02:33] you know we can talk about those things
[1:02:38] and then we got to talking about the
[1:02:39] fall in the garden
[1:02:41] and i asked him i said now you believe
[1:02:43] don't you
[1:02:44] believe in the fall in the garden they
[1:02:47] said yes and they said
[1:02:48] do you believe it was an apple and they
[1:02:51] laughed
[1:02:56] and so we got to talking about serpent
[1:02:59] seed
[1:03:00] we got to talk and i think i mentioned
[1:03:02] it this morning i asked
[1:03:04] you know well does god know who's going
[1:03:06] to heaven
[1:03:08] and i ask him well who when did he know
[1:03:10] that
[1:03:12] and then we got to talking about
[1:03:13] predestination we talked about the cedar
[1:03:15] trees in california and how
[1:03:17] one of those trees will produce
[1:03:20] thousands of pine cones in its
[1:03:22] lifetime but only a handful of those are
[1:03:25] destined to life
[1:03:27] it'll produce thousands you look around
[1:03:29] those trees and they're just
[1:03:30] piles and these trees live for hundreds
[1:03:33] of years
[1:03:33] and every year they're putting out
[1:03:35] hundreds and hundreds
[1:03:37] those giant trees just hundreds of these
[1:03:40] pine cones and in every pine cone there
[1:03:42] might be 50 or 100
[1:03:44] seeds but in the life of that tree
[1:03:48] it'll only produce six other
[1:03:52] giant sequoia trees
[1:03:56] but god knows every seed
[1:04:00] that will come to life and produce
[1:04:02] another tree
[1:04:06] and we just we're talking about these
[1:04:09] things just as natural
[1:04:11] as we were reading this you know sports
[1:04:13] page or something just
[1:04:15] normal and mustafa says to me he says mr
[1:04:18] dennis
[1:04:19] he said these things
[1:04:22] the normal person is not thinking
[1:04:25] of these things he said these things are
[1:04:28] very high
[1:04:30] and i said mustafa no they're not
[1:04:35] who are we look at the three of us here
[1:04:37] these things are not high
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:46] it's just the truth and and we had such
[1:04:49] a wonderful time and we sat there for
[1:04:52] two hours without conflict
[1:04:54] three men just observing
[1:04:57] simple truths
[1:05:01] so they got up and mustafa says to me
[1:05:04] yes
[1:05:05] he said all these things are true mr
[1:05:07] dennis but
[1:05:10] you must receive god's messenger
[1:05:13] when god sends a messenger you are
[1:05:16] obligated
[1:05:17] to receive him
[1:05:20] i said yes mustafa you mean like a
[1:05:23] prophet
[1:05:24] he said yes
[1:05:28] and i said well i said how would we know
[1:05:32] he was a prophet would he be
[1:05:34] vindicated by god i said let me write a
[1:05:37] little name here
[1:05:38] mustafa i said search it out
[1:05:42] see if this is god's messenger
[1:05:46] because he'd already said amen to
[1:05:49] so many things he preached
[1:05:54] but so now paul is talking about some
[1:05:57] very
[1:05:57] common things and the and this is what
[1:06:01] sometimes we we just overshoot it in the
[1:06:04] scripture
[1:06:04] you know we're so we're so uh
[1:06:08] wanting to be revelation prone
[1:06:12] that we overshoot the mark
[1:06:16] when if we would just allow god to talk
[1:06:20] to us in something very simple
[1:06:22] and take the word of god at face value
[1:06:27] i never understood that exception i had
[1:06:29] to ask my mother
[1:06:31] to explain that
[1:06:34] and i said you always use that
[1:06:36] expression mom what do you mean by that
[1:06:38] taking something at
[1:06:40] face value and she says well get a
[1:06:42] quarter out he said what does it say on
[1:06:44] there it says
[1:06:44] 25 cents that's what that's worth
[1:06:48] 25 cents that's the face value of it now
[1:06:51] i suppose
[1:06:53] that if it was a 20 i don't know what
[1:06:55] quarter would be some value but i guess
[1:06:57] you know to a collector you know they
[1:06:59] might say well actually that's
[1:07:01] that coin is a collector's item it's
[1:07:04] it's worth
[1:07:05] more than the face value but if we would
[1:07:08] just
[1:07:10] take the word of god at face value
[1:07:14] and and instead of trying to read
[1:07:18] revelation into it just accept it how
[1:07:21] god
[1:07:22] is speaking his word to us
[1:07:29] and paul's just asking us to consider
[1:07:32] that the seed that you put in the ground
[1:07:41] first thing he says thou fool that which
[1:07:44] thou sowest
[1:07:46] is not quickened except it die
[1:07:53] so we're talking about the resurrection
[1:07:56] now how
[1:07:57] paul's just saying everybody knows that
[1:08:00] that seed has to be buried
[1:08:06] and that's what the prophet of god
[1:08:07] expressed to us about the new birth
[1:08:10] that you have to die that the first
[1:08:14] doctrine of jesus the first
[1:08:17] teaching the first thing that he wanted
[1:08:20] man to understand
[1:08:22] is that you can't understand
[1:08:27] the kingdom of god unless you're born
[1:08:30] again
[1:08:35] and then by the grace of god we
[1:08:36] understood the prophet to
[1:08:38] explain to us that you can't be born
[1:08:40] again
[1:08:42] until you first die so there is that
[1:08:46] principle that there has to be a
[1:08:48] dying for there to be life and that
[1:08:52] doesn't happen when you ju
[1:08:54] when you get converted but you learn
[1:08:56] that that's a principle
[1:08:58] that for someone else to prosper
[1:09:03] you have to give up your space
[1:09:08] for someone else to flourish you got to
[1:09:11] give them room
[1:09:17] somebody else's rest
[1:09:20] is purchased by your labors
[1:09:28] by your sacrifice someone benefits
[1:09:33] it's just the way life is
[1:09:36] but what happens in a christian is they
[1:09:38] get so in love with god
[1:09:41] and they get so much of the love of god
[1:09:43] in their life
[1:09:45] first being a recipient
[1:09:49] that's what's so beautiful about the
[1:09:50] message that paul was bringing this
[1:09:53] morning was
[1:09:54] is that first we have to see
[1:09:57] where he come from and what he did
[1:10:02] we have to see it coming this way
[1:10:06] and i think so many times we just get so
[1:10:09] excited
[1:10:10] about being a son of god being a
[1:10:11] manifested son of god at the end time
[1:10:14] and
[1:10:14] manifesting the word born bride seed
[1:10:18] for our age and we're just like well you
[1:10:20] know where do i get into that
[1:10:22] where does it start where do i sign
[1:10:27] you start by recognizing what he did
[1:10:31] before we can go this way
[1:10:35] we have to see how he came
[1:10:38] this way and that was what paul was
[1:10:42] trying to express in hebrews this
[1:10:44] morning
[1:10:44] is how he the fountain of all holiness
[1:10:49] took on sin
[1:10:57] and became sin and became
[1:11:00] sinful man so there's great parallel in
[1:11:04] these scriptures about
[1:11:05] we were talking about the temple that
[1:11:07] jesus
[1:11:09] put on or the body that jesus
[1:11:13] lived in but paul talking about the
[1:11:16] resurrection and that which thou sowest
[1:11:19] thou sowest not
[1:11:20] that body that shall be
[1:11:24] you don't see after you put that little
[1:11:27] tomato seed in the ground
[1:11:31] your children that go to school you
[1:11:33] don't see a little seed pop up
[1:11:41] but
[1:11:44] thou showest not that body that shall be
[1:11:47] but bear grain it may
[1:11:48] chance of wheat or of some other grain
[1:11:51] but
[1:11:52] god giveth the body giveth it a body
[1:11:56] as it hath pleased him and to every seed
[1:12:01] his own body all flesh is not the same
[1:12:05] flesh but there is one
[1:12:06] kind of flesh of men another
[1:12:10] flesh of beast another of fishes and
[1:12:12] another of birds
[1:12:15] there are also celestial bodies and
[1:12:18] terrestrial bodies terrestrial but the
[1:12:22] glory of the celestial is one and the
[1:12:24] glory
[1:12:25] of the terrestrial is another
[1:12:29] there is one glory of the sun and
[1:12:31] another glory of the moon and another
[1:12:33] glory of the stars for one star
[1:12:36] differeth from another star in glory
[1:12:42] so also is the resurrection
[1:12:46] of the dead
[1:12:49] what art now what is the sowing
[1:12:53] that paul is speaking of here the
[1:12:56] resurrection
[1:12:59] this so
[1:13:02] also is the resurrection of the dead
[1:13:05] it is sown in corruption
[1:13:09] it is raised in incorruption
[1:13:13] it is sown in dishonor it is
[1:13:16] raised in glory
[1:13:26] it is sown in weakness
[1:13:30] it is raised in power
[1:13:36] it is sown a natural body it is raised a
[1:13:40] spiritual body
[1:13:42] there is a natural body and there is a
[1:13:44] spiritual body
[1:13:46] and so it is so it is written
[1:13:49] the first man adam was made a living
[1:13:51] soul and the last adam was made
[1:13:54] a quickening spirit
[1:13:57] how be it that was not first
[1:14:01] which is spiritual but that which is
[1:14:03] natural
[1:14:04] and afterwards that which
[1:14:08] is spiritual
[1:14:11] the first man is of the earth
[1:14:15] earthly the second man
[1:14:18] is the lord from heaven
[1:14:23] and we won't read all of this
[1:14:27] but
[1:14:30] when god brings you certain places in
[1:14:33] your life
[1:14:35] by necessity by
[1:14:40] survival
[1:14:43] you have to look at the truth and
[1:14:46] embrace
[1:14:47] the truth that
[1:14:51] man always
[1:14:55] feared death
[1:15:00] and there's no glorious
[1:15:03] way to die you say well if you if you
[1:15:06] died a hero but it's still death
[1:15:10] and and then there's men that died
[1:15:12] heroes never recognized to heroes i grew
[1:15:15] up in the vietnam war
[1:15:17] mothers lost their sons by the thousands
[1:15:21] and brothers and sisters lost their sil
[1:15:23] siblings and
[1:15:25] you know fathers lost their sons and and
[1:15:27] men
[1:15:28] saw their buddies bosom buddies
[1:15:32] die in combat terrible deaths
[1:15:35] but they never were recognized
[1:15:38] as heroes not like the second world war
[1:15:42] where
[1:15:43] the men come back on the ships and and
[1:15:46] and the people said you know
[1:15:47] you came back you you were a hero for
[1:15:50] freedom
[1:15:54] but in the bibliwack of life in in
[1:15:59] in all what's going around the world
[1:16:02] there's a tremendous amount of
[1:16:06] heartache and suffering amongst men
[1:16:11] and who can console and who can comfort
[1:16:14] those things
[1:16:15] only god can by
[1:16:18] his truth the word of god
[1:16:21] that one truth is that the resurrection
[1:16:27] is sown it's sown
[1:16:36] and i had on my heart this evening to
[1:16:38] kind of
[1:16:40] review what we spoke about this morning
[1:16:43] but
[1:16:45] if we could get a little bit to the crux
[1:16:47] of it what we were speaking about is how
[1:16:50] that
[1:16:50] man gets in this condition
[1:16:54] where he's ashamed of himself
[1:17:01] he's tired he's worn out he's confused
[1:17:05] he's frustrated
[1:17:06] he's dejected and rightly so
[1:17:11] we're not making light by throwing
[1:17:14] adjectives about
[1:17:15] real heartache
[1:17:20] to me it would be tragic to to craft
[1:17:23] words when men's hearts and lives
[1:17:28] are when they're suffering and and it's
[1:17:31] real
[1:17:33] that's not our purpose this evening but
[1:17:37] all of us brothers and sisters we find
[1:17:39] ourselves in this place where
[1:17:43] we don't mind fighting a battle
[1:17:46] to win the prize we don't mind
[1:17:50] investing ourselves to know that hey
[1:17:54] we're
[1:17:54] we're we're gonna overcome we're gonna
[1:17:58] we're gonna win the prize we're we're
[1:18:01] gonna be there with him and
[1:18:03] and when this is all said and done in
[1:18:06] the holy writ
[1:18:07] it's gonna be written that we fought a
[1:18:09] good fight
[1:18:11] we we ran the race we faithed it out
[1:18:14] we persevered and we did it in christ's
[1:18:17] name because we loved him
[1:18:19] and we were real soldiers of the cross
[1:18:26] and our desire
[1:18:29] is to lay our armor
[1:18:33] down and rest with him
[1:18:38] and hear him say well done
[1:18:42] my good and faithful servant
[1:18:47] but do we go through our whole life
[1:18:52] in some kind of a mental chaos and
[1:18:55] in some kind of an upset way and
[1:18:58] uh and and and you know some people when
[1:19:02] they work
[1:19:03] get very in a huff and now
[1:19:06] probably nobody in here but but some
[1:19:09] people you know they get so
[1:19:10] goal orientated they really get huffy
[1:19:13] when they're trying to get something
[1:19:14] done
[1:19:16] and and it's just it's licensed
[1:19:21] for anything you know it's it's like get
[1:19:23] out of the way brother aaron i'm going
[1:19:25] to preach tonight if it
[1:19:26] you know hairless the governor and and
[1:19:29] and
[1:19:32] you know it's this disregard for
[1:19:34] everybody around them because hey
[1:19:38] you know god said in the garden by the
[1:19:41] sweat of your brow and
[1:19:43] that's just how it is and and if you
[1:19:46] don't like it get out of my way
[1:19:48] and and what is this glorious thing that
[1:19:52] gives license to that it's it's this job
[1:19:55] that's in front of you
[1:19:57] you know and
[1:20:02] but we would we would be willing to
[1:20:06] sacrifice our lives that our
[1:20:10] testimony would be that
[1:20:14] that he really pushed through
[1:20:18] and and pursued and paid the price
[1:20:27] but is it the will of god
[1:20:33] that we live
[1:20:38] in a dust storm in a in a cloud of dust
[1:20:41] of struggling and
[1:20:43] and working and then all of a sudden at
[1:20:46] the end of the road
[1:20:47] in all of this chaos and confusion in
[1:20:50] our life
[1:20:50] jesus is going to say well done faithful
[1:20:53] servant
[1:20:54] is that how we think it is is that what
[1:20:57] we're thinking
[1:21:00] or are we supposed to be
[1:21:06] partakers of the divine nature
[1:21:11] and jesus knew he was putting on
[1:21:14] sinful flesh when he came to earth he
[1:21:17] wasn't taking on
[1:21:20] dust man as we said this morning little
[1:21:23] jesus you know said well i'll take a
[1:21:26] little potash i'll take a little
[1:21:28] calcium i'm repeating myself for the
[1:21:31] benefit of somebody who wasn't here
[1:21:34] step into that gabriel step into that
[1:21:37] wormwood
[1:21:39] he stepped in it to himself that's not
[1:21:41] the man
[1:21:42] that jesus came to be
[1:21:45] that's when he called himself the son of
[1:21:48] man
[1:21:51] he was the son of god but he came as son
[1:21:54] of man
[1:21:56] sinful man the prophet of god said
[1:21:58] sinful man
[1:21:59] so that he would know the nature
[1:22:03] that he would know what we're feeling
[1:22:06] and we
[1:22:07] read where brother branham said that
[1:22:09] it's not the idea that he just
[1:22:11] knows what you're going through because
[1:22:14] he's god and he's omnipotent and he
[1:22:16] knows all things
[1:22:17] but it's very different when you see it
[1:22:19] in light of the word of god
[1:22:21] that he came to be our brethren
[1:22:24] and a partaker of this flesh that
[1:22:27] we live in fallen man
[1:22:34] that's why he called himself son of man
[1:22:37] because
[1:22:38] that's he he became son of man
[1:22:42] to take that stinger of
[1:22:45] of sin because the sting of
[1:22:49] death is sin and that stinger had to
[1:22:53] anchor in flesh
[1:22:57] not in theophany not in some
[1:23:01] other form but man he took
[1:23:04] the sting of death for man
[1:23:08] so now is it so that we just
[1:23:13] press on through chaos and and confusion
[1:23:17] so that jesus can say well done
[1:23:22] or is it possible that god wants us to
[1:23:25] understand that
[1:23:26] in our struggles and in our battles
[1:23:33] that we don't have to get beside
[1:23:35] ourselves
[1:23:36] and take on an attitude
[1:23:39] and say well i don't know why i'm the
[1:23:41] way i am just let me be let's just let
[1:23:44] me press on
[1:23:45] i don't know why i'm so confused but i'm
[1:23:47] just going forward
[1:23:49] i don't believe that that's the
[1:23:51] fellowship that god
[1:23:52] wanted us to have in this life
[1:23:59] because god brought us into this life
[1:24:03] why what's job one for every believer
[1:24:14] to be somebody that god can have
[1:24:17] fellowship with
[1:24:21] you ever had a friend who was so nervous
[1:24:23] they had to clean
[1:24:24] they had to work i had a friend one time
[1:24:27] we got an invite over to their house and
[1:24:31] that was so great you know because they
[1:24:32] never had time to you know had too much
[1:24:35] fellowship or at least the brother
[1:24:36] didn't and
[1:24:37] i was like looking forward to like man
[1:24:38] i'm gonna hang with this brother
[1:24:46] you know and you talk to him and he's
[1:24:47] bringing in the firewood and then you
[1:24:49] know then it's over there and he's
[1:24:50] picking up and he's cleaning them
[1:24:52] my poor wife would never have me do this
[1:24:54] you know clean if you're going to have
[1:24:55] fellowship with them
[1:24:57] you know you're just going to have to
[1:24:58] walk around with them and talk to them
[1:25:00] so anyway how did that go over there uh
[1:25:03] you know doing okay for you
[1:25:10] but that's not the kind of fellowship
[1:25:13] that great if he would have sat down
[1:25:14] with a cup of coffee and looked me in
[1:25:16] the eyes
[1:25:17] and and we could you know kind of talk
[1:25:20] about life and
[1:25:21] what you're looking forward to and what
[1:25:23] you've been through
[1:25:25] so i do believe that god
[1:25:28] desires that kind of fellowship
[1:25:31] with his children real idol
[1:25:35] so what is it that causes us
[1:25:39] to not be eye to eye as one brother said
[1:25:43] and we're borrowing from this morning
[1:25:49] he said i always prayed that god you're
[1:25:51] aware
[1:25:53] of where i'm at you know everything
[1:25:57] and because that you know everything
[1:26:01] you know i failed you today you know i
[1:26:03] came short today
[1:26:07] and i'm sorry you know you're god in
[1:26:10] heaven and you know all things and he
[1:26:12] said
[1:26:12] after he considered these things that
[1:26:16] paul was saying in second hebrews about
[1:26:19] what is man that you are mindful of him
[1:26:23] or the son of man that thou visites him
[1:26:28] and after seeing how that paul would
[1:26:31] express
[1:26:32] that he is touched by the feelings of
[1:26:35] our infirmities
[1:26:36] why because he felt them
[1:26:44] he knew what it was to have to get up
[1:26:48] after falling down on the way to calvary
[1:26:53] to say i came for this purpose
[1:26:57] i he knew what it was to ache in his
[1:27:01] body and to be
[1:27:02] suffering in his body and not only was
[1:27:05] he suffering in his body but he was
[1:27:08] being accused of being some
[1:27:11] wacko religious
[1:27:15] nut who thought that he was god
[1:27:19] and the to the very people that he came
[1:27:22] to save
[1:27:22] he knew he felt rejection
[1:27:26] he was every bit of man you say well he
[1:27:29] didn't feel that he was just
[1:27:30] some angel that put on a robe and he was
[1:27:33] invincible and and and you know he was
[1:27:36] just
[1:27:37] doing his job that's not true
[1:27:40] because he wept at the grave of lazarus
[1:27:44] he came into jerusalem and he
[1:27:47] wept over jerusalem and he said oh
[1:27:50] jerusalem jerusalem how often i would
[1:27:53] have hovered you
[1:27:56] and how many times have we had desires
[1:28:00] in our heart and things we wanted to do
[1:28:03] and
[1:28:03] what we wanted to do be for people maybe
[1:28:06] our own children our own family and we
[1:28:08] had these desires of
[1:28:10] of of our
[1:28:14] emotions and our affections and the
[1:28:17] things that were in us and by
[1:28:20] god's great providence we're never
[1:28:24] allowed to be displayed
[1:28:28] and were so disappointed
[1:28:32] disappointed to the bone
[1:28:38] did he feel that did jesus
[1:28:41] ever feel that
[1:28:47] yes he took
[1:28:50] the sting of death
[1:28:54] in his flesh he became
[1:28:58] flesh
[1:29:03] and so here we are in life in all of
[1:29:05] these struggles
[1:29:10] and because we don't understand
[1:29:15] what he was trying to express when he
[1:29:18] said
[1:29:19] i know the pain you feel
[1:29:23] we're we're being redundant from this
[1:29:25] morning sermon
[1:29:29] i just beg your forgiveness but
[1:29:32] i just want to go there
[1:29:40] that we cause it to be some kind of a
[1:29:44] intellectual thing some kind of an
[1:29:46] academic thing had
[1:29:47] something just to be aware of like like
[1:29:50] science and
[1:29:51] just to know that god is god
[1:29:54] and god knows every detail of your life
[1:30:02] and we accept that and we
[1:30:05] sell short the whole concept of god's
[1:30:09] love
[1:30:10] it's not that i'm just omnipotent
[1:30:15] and i know everything so i know every
[1:30:17] detail about that situation that's
[1:30:20] not what god is trying to express in his
[1:30:22] word
[1:30:23] he's trying to express to us and have
[1:30:26] this fellowship with us
[1:30:28] that i know
[1:30:31] not because i'm omnipotent i know
[1:30:33] because
[1:30:34] i was there i wore that robe
[1:30:38] of sinful flesh i know what that
[1:30:41] rush of temptation is
[1:30:44] and how foreign it feels to you
[1:30:48] as a son and daughter of god when that
[1:30:51] flush of temptation comes over or that
[1:30:54] that ungodly sinful nature
[1:30:59] washes over you to test you
[1:31:04] i know i felt that
[1:31:07] because i was in every way tempted
[1:31:10] as you are
[1:31:17] but what does man do what does the
[1:31:19] believer do
[1:31:24] i can only speak from
[1:31:28] my experience but it looks like it's in
[1:31:31] the word of god
[1:31:32] man
[1:31:36] when these things come upon him
[1:31:41] it seems that he he thinks that
[1:31:44] temptation is a strange thing
[1:31:47] and he thinks that i must be in
[1:31:52] there must be something wrong in my
[1:31:55] spiritual life
[1:31:57] there must be something wrong
[1:32:00] that i would come into this place that
[1:32:02] seems so
[1:32:04] unholy that seems
[1:32:07] so weak
[1:32:10] that seems so
[1:32:18] unlike what i
[1:32:21] desire to be
[1:32:27] and we want to hide that from god we
[1:32:29] want to
[1:32:34] maybe feel like well this behavior now
[1:32:38] now the way i'm behaving now that let's
[1:32:40] have that off the record
[1:32:43] let's not have that be on the record
[1:32:44] this is a this is a lapse
[1:32:46] in my christian experience this is a
[1:32:49] little backslid moment
[1:32:51] this is a little i'm weary i'm just so
[1:32:54] tired
[1:32:55] i just don't want to go on anymore
[1:32:58] but don't let anybody hear i said that
[1:33:03] because i'm a manifested son of god in
[1:33:07] the end time
[1:33:08] with a revelation of the word of god i'm
[1:33:10] an overcomer i'm
[1:33:11] i'm i'm more than overcomer or we we
[1:33:14] sing in
[1:33:15] in in church that that that i'm more
[1:33:18] than an overcomer
[1:33:20] and so we just want to disconnect this
[1:33:22] part of our life
[1:33:23] and and and pretend
[1:33:27] that it's not part of it that that's
[1:33:29] just me
[1:33:32] that's just you know that's just
[1:33:36] brother dennis lord i don't know why i'm
[1:33:39] like that
[1:33:40] and it's a disconnect it's a disconnect
[1:33:43] it's like
[1:33:44] i don't want to i i don't know why i'm
[1:33:46] that way and i don't want to talk about
[1:33:48] it and
[1:33:49] let's not go there and let's talk about
[1:33:51] something else and
[1:33:52] and and sweep that under the carpet and
[1:33:55] let's talk about
[1:33:57] you know the next life for heaven or
[1:33:59] let's talk about the prophet of god
[1:34:01] let's talk about revelation
[1:34:03] but let's not go there
[1:34:08] but but why would we want to live like
[1:34:10] that
[1:34:12] why not bring it to the lord jesus
[1:34:15] and say lord i got everything to be
[1:34:19] happy about
[1:34:23] but i'm real tired right now
[1:34:26] and i know you've been tired like this
[1:34:33] i don't seem to fit i've labored all my
[1:34:35] life
[1:34:36] to be a dad or a husband or
[1:34:40] you know part of the church and i was a
[1:34:44] young man i drove in my car from one end
[1:34:46] of the town
[1:34:48] bought a coke drove all through town
[1:34:50] real slow
[1:34:52] real slow
[1:34:56] all the way to the other tent of the
[1:34:58] town
[1:34:59] and bought an ice cream i hope you don't
[1:35:02] think this is foolish
[1:35:05] i was trying to live for god and i was
[1:35:07] lonely
[1:35:09] i knew the prophet of god said not to go
[1:35:11] to movies
[1:35:12] but i didn't have any family in town i
[1:35:14] couldn't go to mom and dad's
[1:35:16] my i couldn't go to my brother my
[1:35:17] brother wasn't in town
[1:35:20] i didn't have anybody i was a young
[1:35:22] person in the in a church
[1:35:24] that didn't have much young people and
[1:35:26] the young people that were were not
[1:35:27] living for the lord they didn't have no
[1:35:29] problem with going to movies and to me
[1:35:31] i had a revelation that that is a bunch
[1:35:34] of the devil's playground the world
[1:35:36] and i'm living for god what in the world
[1:35:39] do i
[1:35:40] belong in a movie house for
[1:35:44] now i i'm just assuming that a young
[1:35:47] person now can have this device
[1:35:49] in front of them and get the same
[1:35:51] revelation oh my goodness
[1:35:54] that is not good for my soul
[1:36:00] it's a greater test we have to we used
[1:36:02] to have to
[1:36:03] you know if you were gonna sin i never
[1:36:05] did by the grace of god i didn't go to
[1:36:07] movies but
[1:36:08] i know that there were some that said
[1:36:09] you know you we'd look around you know
[1:36:11] make sure
[1:36:12] nobody's going to see us go in the
[1:36:14] building
[1:36:17] you hear all kinds of stories you know
[1:36:19] and then they then they run into
[1:36:21] somebody
[1:36:21] and they're like wow you're as bachelor
[1:36:23] as i am
[1:36:24] what are you doing here
[1:36:28] but no now the stakes are way higher now
[1:36:32] you just got your own privacy
[1:36:34] and your own device you don't think that
[1:36:37] god's raising the bar on holiness
[1:36:40] you don't think that in the end time
[1:36:42] you're going to have to be a bigger
[1:36:43] greater young person believer than
[1:36:47] ever any age in the past because there's
[1:36:50] nobody going to see what you're watching
[1:36:52] on your phone it's only
[1:36:53] between you and the savior and if you're
[1:36:56] gonna stand
[1:36:58] you're gonna stand by your own integrity
[1:37:03] which when we say your own integrity
[1:37:05] it's something that god's going to do
[1:37:07] in your heart and soul
[1:37:10] and cause you to eschew evil
[1:37:15] but why is it that when we're tempted
[1:37:18] we somehow have this disconnect with our
[1:37:21] lord and savior and say oh
[1:37:23] this this this is now confusion
[1:37:28] this part here this is not
[1:37:31] the holiness life this is not because
[1:37:34] i'm i'm being pressed upon
[1:37:37] i'm not feeling good i'm not maybe
[1:37:41] mastering this with my mental ability
[1:37:44] i'm struggling
[1:37:51] and that's not fellowship with jesus
[1:37:54] sure it is yes you're being a partaker
[1:37:59] of his sufferings like job said this
[1:38:02] morning if i be wicked then why do i
[1:38:04] labor
[1:38:05] for favor with god if if i'm just gonna
[1:38:08] you know if i'm the rat
[1:38:09] that the devil made me up let go let me
[1:38:11] find a hole and crawl in it but
[1:38:13] i'm not a rat i'm a son of god but i'm
[1:38:16] in
[1:38:16] this body i was born a son of man
[1:38:22] and that's why he identified himself
[1:38:25] as the son of man because he came
[1:38:29] and suffered in this body
[1:38:33] yes and the resurrection is sown
[1:38:37] in weakness
[1:38:41] this is that sowing
[1:38:46] it's up to god to give it a body
[1:38:51] ah but we got a sneak preview of the new
[1:38:55] body
[1:38:57] we got some inside information on what
[1:38:59] to invest in
[1:39:01] you know if you do that on wall street
[1:39:04] they call that inside trading you might
[1:39:06] could go to prison
[1:39:13] but we got some information on inside
[1:39:15] trading
[1:39:16] on what to invest in
[1:39:20] and we're so confident on the
[1:39:23] information
[1:39:24] that we got that we're putting all
[1:39:27] our chips on one square and people are
[1:39:29] looking around and they're saying you're
[1:39:31] kidding me
[1:39:33] you're putting all your chips on the
[1:39:36] resurrection
[1:39:37] and they say yeah because i got a little
[1:39:40] glimpse of it
[1:39:45] i saw the waving of the sheath
[1:39:50] i saw the first man that race
[1:39:53] from the dead
[1:40:00] jesus christ the son of god
[1:40:06] as a student of the word of god if i
[1:40:08] understand the bible brother branham
[1:40:10] wasn't that chief
[1:40:13] jesus was that chief brother branham was
[1:40:16] the priest that waved the sheaf and said
[1:40:19] jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:40:23] today and forever that spirit
[1:40:26] that can enter you into you
[1:40:30] and mortify this mortal body
[1:40:35] if it can if that life overcame death
[1:40:42] how much more can that life living in
[1:40:44] you
[1:40:46] make alive or quicken this mortal body
[1:40:53] there's no evidence and no
[1:40:56] theory and postulate that man
[1:41:00] has produced no matter how many
[1:41:02] self-help books
[1:41:05] i'm not a believer in them but when i
[1:41:07] read the title i think man maybe
[1:41:09] maybe that one huh you ever read those
[1:41:13] titles
[1:41:15] and it just it has such a great promise
[1:41:18] you know
[1:41:21] how to establish financial freedom in
[1:41:24] three easy steps
[1:41:26] and man it's only seven bucks
[1:41:32] but they do it in the spiritual realm
[1:41:34] too
[1:41:38] turn on the tv it'll break your heart
[1:41:41] i was in bulgaria and they
[1:41:45] didn't have a translator for me so i'm
[1:41:46] staying at a house so what do you do
[1:41:48] with this guy that don't speak your
[1:41:50] language
[1:41:50] well set him in front of the tv and
[1:41:53] stick a benny hinn video on for him
[1:41:55] it's in english the guy can watch benny
[1:41:58] han
[1:41:58] he's a christian he's going to love it
[1:42:03] oh my goodness and these people
[1:42:07] are poor as dirt excuse me to speak
[1:42:10] about my brothers and sisters like that
[1:42:11] i don't mean
[1:42:13] but you know in the natural realm
[1:42:19] and they want 45 us dollars
[1:42:23] for his promise to how to
[1:42:26] overcome temptation
[1:42:29] what christian doesn't want to know how
[1:42:32] to overcome temptation
[1:42:35] but the word of god tells us that he
[1:42:39] came down and suffered temptation
[1:42:43] so that he would know how to secure
[1:42:49] sakura means comfort and secure means
[1:42:52] make secure so that he would know
[1:42:57] and as we came to the end of the sermon
[1:42:59] this morning we
[1:43:01] began to speak about
[1:43:07] this concept of
[1:43:14] well maybe we didn't go that far but
[1:43:18] we learned in the old testament that
[1:43:19] when a man
[1:43:21] brought the lamb
[1:43:25] and this lamb that was offered was going
[1:43:28] to be an innocent lamb
[1:43:31] and that lamb was going to die
[1:43:34] in the place of the sinner so if we
[1:43:37] lived in that day and we
[1:43:39] brought our lamb to the temple
[1:43:43] we're familiar with the idea that the
[1:43:46] the comer had to
[1:43:50] identify with his sacrifice
[1:43:53] brother ranum explained how that they
[1:43:55] would
[1:43:57] lay their hand on that bleeding lamb
[1:44:02] and when that lamb would die and quiver
[1:44:08] they get their hands in that blood and
[1:44:11] see that
[1:44:12] innocent life and say this lamb
[1:44:17] is dying in my stead and the idea and
[1:44:20] the picture was
[1:44:24] to enter in to that lamb's suffering
[1:44:31] now we as believers
[1:44:35] we long to understand
[1:44:38] calvary more
[1:44:41] and to have a greater appreciation
[1:44:45] of jesus's suffering at calvary
[1:44:52] but before we do that
[1:44:55] think of it in this way that jesus
[1:44:59] didn't just lay his hands on
[1:45:03] us to understand us
[1:45:07] think of it going the other way now
[1:45:08] we're trying to understand
[1:45:11] who he was and and what he went through
[1:45:17] but first because
[1:45:20] we're not certain that we can really
[1:45:22] grasp that
[1:45:23] and i remember times when i've prayed
[1:45:26] and i've asked the lord you know
[1:45:28] give me a greater understanding and
[1:45:31] and vision of calvary and i was amazed
[1:45:34] at the
[1:45:35] ministers you set by and brothers that
[1:45:37] came and preached in something and i
[1:45:39] think
[1:45:39] i think oh lord you know thank you but
[1:45:44] still we we might wonder if we really
[1:45:48] understand but one thing we know for
[1:45:51] sure
[1:45:53] is that coming the other way
[1:45:57] that he does understand our condition
[1:46:01] that there's no there's no disconnect
[1:46:04] with god
[1:46:06] understanding what you're suffering
[1:46:09] because he was there because
[1:46:13] he experienced it
[1:46:23] and so in our lives
[1:46:27] when we come into these places where
[1:46:32] i don't mean to use casual words in such
[1:46:36] a sacred subject but
[1:46:38] we feel so yucky things come
[1:46:41] under over us and come to tempt us and
[1:46:44] come
[1:46:44] in and and and expose our
[1:46:48] our condition and we just think yuck
[1:46:52] you know god changed me i i don't
[1:46:56] want to struggle with these things
[1:47:00] that is not a time to unplug
[1:47:05] it's a time when you feel that
[1:47:11] and you feel your humanity and
[1:47:13] everything that goes with
[1:47:14] it to say jesus we have fellowship in
[1:47:20] this
[1:47:24] you know what this is
[1:47:28] we can commune in this
[1:47:34] we can have oneness we can have
[1:47:36] fellowship
[1:47:37] you can be my brother you were not
[1:47:41] ashamed to call me
[1:47:45] your brother
[1:47:50] and paul had to do this he had
[1:47:53] to
[1:47:56] explain and express
[1:48:01] the true condition of jesus coming as
[1:48:06] the son of man
[1:48:08] and you say well brother dennis i always
[1:48:10] understood that to be a prophet
[1:48:14] no that's just part of it
[1:48:18] when god spoke to ezekiel he said son of
[1:48:21] man prophesy
[1:48:23] the astounding thing was that the word
[1:48:26] of god
[1:48:27] could be on the lips of a man
[1:48:33] how that moses that's the thing that
[1:48:35] that they got confused with moses and
[1:48:37] they said hey wait a minute
[1:48:43] you're not the only one holy we
[1:48:45] recognize that you're a man
[1:48:47] just like we are
[1:48:51] but the difference with moses was the
[1:48:53] word of god was on his lips
[1:48:56] and that's when god spoke to ezekiel and
[1:48:58] he said son a man prophesy
[1:49:00] he meant just that son of man man born
[1:49:04] of women
[1:49:06] what's one of the other expressions the
[1:49:09] sons of men
[1:49:11] son of man prophesy i'm going to put my
[1:49:14] word
[1:49:15] on your lips that's what a prophet is
[1:49:17] just
[1:49:18] a man with the word of god on his lips
[1:49:21] that's why they called them son of man
[1:49:23] and when jesus came and walked in flesh
[1:49:27] he he was every bit man
[1:49:30] and that's why he introduced himself as
[1:49:33] the son of man and the people couldn't
[1:49:37] understand it and they said
[1:49:39] he said the son of man shall be lifted
[1:49:41] up
[1:49:42] and when the son of man is lifted up
[1:49:45] i'll draw
[1:49:46] all man unto me and they said
[1:49:52] how says thou
[1:50:00] they said who is this son of man how
[1:50:03] many know the scripture we're talking
[1:50:05] about
[1:50:06] huh let's see a few hands just so we
[1:50:08] know
[1:50:09] okay you guys can tell the others
[1:50:12] well we ought to i mean we
[1:50:16] are we under such spiritual pressure
[1:50:18] that we can't
[1:50:19] be natural in families with one another
[1:50:22] and just say man
[1:50:23] well do you know what that means
[1:50:26] or do we got to put on some facade
[1:50:31] like i heard that before yeah i know
[1:50:33] that i know that
[1:50:34] i know i got a grandson that says that
[1:50:36] he's about
[1:50:37] seven i think i know i i already know
[1:50:40] that
[1:50:42] i'm i'm trying to come up with things
[1:50:43] that he doesn't know he's
[1:50:45] had a lot of exposure at seven years old
[1:50:48] so it takes me a lot to think of
[1:50:50] something that he doesn't already
[1:50:52] know but is that how we get can we just
[1:50:57] know that we're sons and daughters of
[1:50:59] god that
[1:51:00] that it's okay to say
[1:51:04] i never understood that in the bible i
[1:51:07] never knew what brother brown was
[1:51:08] talking about
[1:51:14] and so they said to him
[1:51:17] they said who is the son of man
[1:51:21] because the scribes and the pharisees
[1:51:23] they say when christ comes
[1:51:27] when messiah comes when the christ comes
[1:51:29] he abideth forever
[1:51:33] what do you mean he'll be lifted up
[1:51:35] because they
[1:51:36] knew that being lifted up was
[1:51:38] crucifixion
[1:51:40] look in your bible read the scriptures
[1:51:42] the scriptures interpret themselves this
[1:51:45] isn't
[1:51:45] a lot of reading between the lines and
[1:51:48] prophetic
[1:51:49] utterance here this is just bible
[1:51:51] reading
[1:51:52] where you you read a couple of verses
[1:51:56] and you say what does that mean and then
[1:51:57] read a few farther
[1:51:59] and the verses that are under those
[1:52:01] verses explain what the verses above
[1:52:03] them were
[1:52:03] that's just easy
[1:52:07] so they said who is this son of man
[1:52:12] because we're expecting the christ
[1:52:15] and he abideth forever
[1:52:18] why do you say the son of man will be
[1:52:21] lifted up
[1:52:25] but how was jesus
[1:52:29] gonna draw all men to him
[1:52:34] by being glorified or be
[1:52:37] by being humiliated
[1:52:42] by dying as a man
[1:52:45] by being lifted up on calvary
[1:52:48] he's going to draw all men unto him
[1:52:53] now when we lift up jesus and we lift up
[1:52:58] his name we're lifting up
[1:53:02] who he was he didn't come
[1:53:05] as son of god some spirit being that was
[1:53:09] above man and
[1:53:13] putting on a mystic
[1:53:17] costume
[1:53:22] like you go to disneyland or disney
[1:53:24] world
[1:53:25] it all looks one way on the face and i
[1:53:28] remember as a little boy
[1:53:29] i lived in san diego we went up to to
[1:53:33] disney world and i can remember when i
[1:53:36] got big enough
[1:53:37] and i looked behind the facade
[1:53:42] and i was shocked my
[1:53:46] you know little young mind went oh
[1:53:50] that's only the old west on the
[1:53:54] front and on the back it's like
[1:53:56] everything else
[1:53:59] i was just like oh
[1:54:04] my reality struck in that it wasn't
[1:54:06] through and through that i
[1:54:08] wasn't back in time i was just
[1:54:12] they put on a facade
[1:54:15] but jesus didn't put on a facade and say
[1:54:18] you know really
[1:54:20] i'm
[1:54:24] something else and i've just got the man
[1:54:26] coat on
[1:54:29] no he became man he became
[1:54:32] sinful flesh he became
[1:54:36] sin for us i got to close
[1:54:40] oh my it's seven we didn't start at six
[1:54:42] we started five
[1:54:43] lord forgive me
[1:54:47] but i challenge you i challenge you just
[1:54:50] go
[1:54:50] in hebrews 2 or hebrews 1. let me just
[1:54:53] give you one you do it at home
[1:54:58] paul trying to introduce who jesus
[1:55:01] really is and he said
[1:55:03] for unto which of the angels
[1:55:06] said he at any time thou art my son
[1:55:09] this day have i begotten thee
[1:55:13] and again quoting another scripture
[1:55:20] i will be to him a father
[1:55:23] and he shall be to me a son
[1:55:26] and if you've got a schofield bible
[1:55:27] there's a little bee by there
[1:55:30] say where it says i will be to him a
[1:55:32] father
[1:55:33] and he will be to me a son
[1:55:36] and it's going to refer you to go and
[1:55:39] read in second
[1:55:40] samuel 7 and 14
[1:55:43] where the prophet samuel
[1:55:46] i mean uh the prophet nathan
[1:55:50] is speaking to david when david wanted
[1:55:53] to build the temple and
[1:55:55] nathan's telling him no it's you're not
[1:55:57] going to build the temple
[1:56:05] let's sneak over there
[1:56:08] quickly
[1:56:11] second samuel 7 14.
[1:56:32] we just go up a little just to get it in
[1:56:34] context
[1:56:39] start 12 and when thy days be fulfilled
[1:56:43] now this is the lord speaking through
[1:56:45] the mouth
[1:56:46] of nathan to david
[1:56:50] and when thy days be fulfilled and thou
[1:56:52] shalt sleep
[1:56:54] with thy fathers i will set up thy seed
[1:56:57] after thee which shall proceed out of
[1:57:01] the
[1:57:01] thy bowels and i will establish
[1:57:04] this kingdom
[1:57:10] he shall build an house for my name and
[1:57:13] i will
[1:57:14] establish the throne of his kingdom
[1:57:17] forever
[1:57:20] i will be his father and he shall be my
[1:57:24] son
[1:57:28] we're all thinking solomon right
[1:57:32] so why when paul
[1:57:35] is referring to jesus is he making his
[1:57:39] case on who jesus is
[1:57:42] he's not an angel he's not a prophet but
[1:57:45] he's this
[1:57:46] one that is spoken of by god
[1:57:50] and he's saying we know he was spoken of
[1:57:52] by god because it's in the scriptures
[1:57:54] he's explaining who jesus is and over
[1:57:57] here in hebrews he's saying i will be to
[1:57:59] him a father
[1:58:00] and he shall be to be a son
[1:58:04] it's just in our mind very clear over
[1:58:07] here in hebrews he's spoken
[1:58:08] speaking about jesus right
[1:58:11] are you with me is anybody with me or is
[1:58:13] it were we okay i know it's late but
[1:58:16] and then when we turn back here to where
[1:58:18] the prophecy comes
[1:58:20] from
[1:58:23] if we do like so many of us do or have
[1:58:27] done i've been guilty of it
[1:58:28] i'm just only going to read 14 and it's
[1:58:31] almost to say like
[1:58:34] okay just uh i'm just a spell checker
[1:58:37] you know i'm just a text
[1:58:39] checker and i see that
[1:58:42] paul quoted the the verse here
[1:58:46] and okay i just confirmed that it's from
[1:58:48] the old testament
[1:58:49] that it's a prophecy and that's as far
[1:58:51] as i go you know it's like
[1:58:53] what am i doing you know checking the
[1:58:56] printer of the bible that the references
[1:58:58] are correct
[1:58:59] am i am i benefiting in my heart and in
[1:59:02] my mind am i getting closer to god
[1:59:05] am i understanding or do i have time for
[1:59:08] that
[1:59:10] didn't mean that to be a rebuke but
[1:59:13] it just is you know if you want a
[1:59:15] friendship you got to spend time with
[1:59:17] somebody
[1:59:21] that's not always easy that's a little
[1:59:23] hard because there's a lot of people
[1:59:25] we'd like to spend more time with so i
[1:59:27] i don't mean to be cocky and be hard but
[1:59:31] that's just one of the hard things of
[1:59:33] life but nevertheless
[1:59:35] if we want to check this old testament
[1:59:39] reference of paul
[1:59:43] and then we go back over here and we
[1:59:45] just read verse 14
[1:59:48] maybe we wouldn't get it in context
[1:59:51] but if we take a little time and say
[1:59:52] okay
[1:59:54] he took this scripture to describe
[1:59:57] jesus who's speaking here in verse 14
[2:00:01] and what is the context of verse 14
[2:00:07] so here we go again on verse 12 and when
[2:00:10] thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt
[2:00:12] sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy
[2:00:15] seed after thee
[2:00:17] which shall proceed out of the out of
[2:00:19] thy bowels
[2:00:20] and i will establish his kingdom he
[2:00:23] shall build a house for my name and i
[2:00:25] will establish the throne of his kingdom
[2:00:27] forever
[2:00:28] i will be his father and he shall be my
[2:00:32] son
[2:00:32] if he commit iniquity i will chasten him
[2:00:36] with the rod of men
[2:00:39] and with the stripes of the children
[2:00:42] of men but my mercy shall not depart
[2:00:46] away from him
[2:00:47] as i took it from saul whom i put away
[2:00:51] before thee
[2:00:52] and thine house and thy kingdom shall be
[2:00:55] established forever
[2:00:58] before thee thy throne shall be
[2:01:00] established
[2:01:01] forever according to all these words and
[2:01:05] according to all this vision
[2:01:07] so did nathan speak unto david
[2:01:10] and we find ourselves in the same place
[2:01:13] that
[2:01:14] philippian eunuch ethiopian eunuch when
[2:01:19] when philip went to him and he said does
[2:01:21] david speak of
[2:01:23] himself or does he speak of another
[2:01:26] now this wasn't perhaps the scripture
[2:01:28] but
[2:01:32] who is the prophet of god speaking of
[2:01:34] here is he speaking of solomon
[2:01:37] or is he speaking of jesus
[2:01:40] and so we come to this verse and it says
[2:01:43] i will be his father and he shall be my
[2:01:47] son
[2:01:48] paul told us that that's
[2:01:51] jesus but then we get to the next verse
[2:01:55] and it says if he commit
[2:01:56] iniquity and we think oh no well that
[2:01:58] can't be jesus
[2:02:01] because jesus couldn't have iniquity
[2:02:06] unless he was wearing it in his flesh
[2:02:11] yours mine
[2:02:14] he was living in it he was living in
[2:02:17] sinful flesh
[2:02:19] the prophet of god said he became a
[2:02:21] sinner
[2:02:26] the fountain of all holiness
[2:02:30] he lived in that flesh
[2:02:37] i don't honestly know what brother
[2:02:39] branham
[2:02:40] commented on the scripture if he did
[2:02:42] please share it with me
[2:02:47] but i can't help but get very suspicious
[2:02:50] when i say when it says i will chasten
[2:02:53] him
[2:02:54] with the rod of men
[2:03:00] and with the stripes of the children of
[2:03:03] man
[2:03:08] what iniquity could jesus have
[2:03:13] mine
[2:03:17] oh the word of god is so beautiful
[2:03:23] when i suffer
[2:03:28] should i disconnect when i go home at
[2:03:32] the end of a day
[2:03:35] the bible says confession is good for
[2:03:37] the soul i start out in the morning
[2:03:42] word of god so awesome you read a little
[2:03:44] message book you read a scripture
[2:03:47] the presence of the lord comes
[2:03:50] man it's so beautiful
[2:03:58] and i drive in my vehicle and i start
[2:04:01] coming close to the house and i feel so
[2:04:03] defeated
[2:04:06] so tired and so weary
[2:04:11] feel like i got nothing left you know
[2:04:14] you're coming home to your family maybe
[2:04:16] to your wife
[2:04:18] and you got nothing left and you think
[2:04:21] where was that from this morning
[2:04:24] where is that guy
[2:04:28] where where is that guy
[2:04:32] and we just wanted like
[2:04:35] you know how some people don't want to
[2:04:36] go on certain apps because your phone
[2:04:38] will know
[2:04:39] where you've been and they give you
[2:04:41] advertising or
[2:04:43] you don't want the gps to know
[2:04:46] where you are am i crazy
[2:04:52] so you wish you could use your phone
[2:04:56] and hide from the gps
[2:04:59] it's like yeah i was looking into this
[2:05:01] but you know please
[2:05:02] don't advertise me to death just because
[2:05:05] i casually
[2:05:06] looked at this product
[2:05:10] and we wish we could just kind of
[2:05:13] and that's somehow sometimes when we get
[2:05:16] weary
[2:05:17] and when we fail and when we get tempted
[2:05:19] and we
[2:05:20] and and and we don't feel like the
[2:05:22] overcomer we should
[2:05:23] we we want to put something up and say
[2:05:26] god don't look at this part
[2:05:30] and he's saying son daughter what do you
[2:05:33] mean don't look at that part i'd live
[2:05:35] there you're going through this
[2:05:39] because you want to be clean because you
[2:05:42] love god
[2:05:43] you're suffering because you love me
[2:05:45] because you want to be clean
[2:05:47] and you're living in a dirty world in a
[2:05:49] fallen condition
[2:05:52] you don't need to put the umbrella up
[2:05:56] talk to me i've been there
[2:05:59] we're in this together
[2:06:03] this is the fellowship that's why i came
[2:06:06] and walked in shoe leather so that we
[2:06:08] could have this fellowship
[2:06:11] god bless you let's stand together
[2:06:29] i know since my little study in hebrews
[2:06:32] i'll never
[2:06:38] think of that title that jesus gave
[2:06:42] himself
[2:06:44] i'll never think of it the same
[2:06:48] said to peter who does man say i
[2:06:53] the son of man am
[2:06:57] peter said despite all outward
[2:07:00] appearances
[2:07:02] you're the christ you're the son of god
[2:07:08] he said peter you didn't get that on
[2:07:10] your own
[2:07:12] you didn't get that because you were
[2:07:13] smart
[2:07:15] god gave you that oh
[2:07:18] hallelujah god gave you
[2:07:21] that love in your heart
[2:07:27] that's why you suffer because god gave
[2:07:30] you that heart
[2:07:31] and that thirst to serve people to love
[2:07:34] god
[2:07:39] that song that we sang earlier in the
[2:07:42] song service
[2:07:45] to be like jesus
[2:07:50] i remember seeing that when i first
[2:07:53] learned it
[2:07:53] right over there
[2:07:57] but maybe before we go i put put a
[2:08:00] little
[2:08:00] song in your remembrance and maybe you
[2:08:03] can go and
[2:08:04] listen to it we had a brother in our
[2:08:08] church at home and maybe i can carry the
[2:08:11] tune myself
[2:08:13] you can venture to help me if you dare
[2:08:16] i i don't promise to be in any
[2:08:19] particular key
[2:08:22] but years ago
[2:08:26] it was so that if someone had a song on
[2:08:28] their heart they'd just come and sing it
[2:08:30] they grabbed that little blue only
[2:08:32] belief book and
[2:08:33] if the lord was dealing with them and
[2:08:35] they wanted to sing that song everybody
[2:08:36] was a singer in the congregation
[2:08:39] now we know everybody's not but it was
[2:08:42] just
[2:08:42] that much family when i first started
[2:08:45] going to church
[2:08:46] you just had enough i don't know
[2:08:49] you could just stand in front of your
[2:08:51] brothers and sisters and say
[2:08:53] this song bless my heart i want to try
[2:08:55] to sing it
[2:08:57] and this brother would come up and he'd
[2:08:58] sing this song
[2:09:05] who am i
[2:09:08] that a king should bleed and die for
[2:09:14] who am i that he
[2:09:18] would pray not my will thine lord
[2:09:25] the answer i may
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:52] when i think of how
[2:09:56] he came so far from
[2:10:00] glory
[2:10:04] came to dwell amongst
[2:10:08] the lowly such as i
[2:10:14] to suffer shame and such
[2:10:19] disgrace on mount
[2:10:22] calvary take
[2:10:25] my place then i ask
[2:10:29] myself this question
[2:10:34] who am i
[2:10:39] oh here
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:52] where am i
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:11:13] [Applause]
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:21] he would
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:29] when i'm reminded of
[2:11:33] his words i'll leave
[2:11:38] [Music]
[2:11:41] just be true i'll give
[2:11:46] to you my life
[2:11:48] [Music]
[2:11:50] forever
[2:11:54] [Music]
[2:12:00] to deserve god's only son
[2:12:07] [Music]
[2:12:12] there
[2:12:14] [Music]
[2:12:30] where am i
[2:12:34] should pray
[2:12:48] just why he ever loved
[2:13:02] let's just bow our heads in prayer
[2:13:06] lord jesus we so love you lord
[2:13:13] and lord all the commandments that were
[2:13:17] very well aware of
[2:13:21] seemed to avail us not
[2:13:24] when they adjured us to be obedient
[2:13:29] we just couldn't do it lord
[2:13:30] [Music]
[2:13:34] but oh lord when we look at what you did
[2:13:37] for us
[2:13:41] when we look at how you suffered for our
[2:13:43] satan
[2:13:46] then some
[2:13:49] love wells up from deep within our heart
[2:13:53] and inspires us
[2:13:55] [Music]
[2:13:56] it causes us to want to be like you and
[2:14:01] we see your love and that love that you
[2:14:03] put in us
[2:14:04] the deep calls to deep and
[2:14:08] it's that love that we see displayed
[2:14:12] that
[2:14:12] inspires our love to want to live
[2:14:15] cleaner
[2:14:16] live truer and be more sincere
[2:14:22] oh that you look at our hearts lord and
[2:14:26] see
[2:14:26] that we want to be genuine and we want
[2:14:28] to be real before you
[2:14:31] we see how your prophet lived his life
[2:14:35] for you
[2:14:35] and all of these things lord what wells
[2:14:39] in us
[2:14:41] is to want to love back lord
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:45] the law never did that lord fear never
[2:14:48] did that but
[2:14:50] love can push our
[2:14:53] faith out on the front lines lord
[2:14:56] we can live the kind of life that we
[2:14:58] desire to live because
[2:15:00] you overcame for us lord
[2:15:04] we can be like all the flowers that you
[2:15:07] made
[2:15:07] and not have our heads tilted down
[2:15:11] like that because that you took our
[2:15:14] shame
[2:15:15] you fellowshipped with us and suffering
[2:15:17] we can lift our head up
[2:15:22] praise you love you
[2:15:25] let our bloom be heaven word lord
[2:15:33] so be it lord may we never
[2:15:36] disconnect in a time of trial and
[2:15:39] tempting and suffering
[2:15:42] oh lord don't let us do that but
[2:15:45] let us reach out to you fellowship with
[2:15:48] you
[2:15:50] in the things that you suffered
[2:15:54] we suffer we give ourselves to you now
[2:15:57] lord
[2:15:58] commit our hearts into your care
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:03] in jesus name amen god bless you saints
[2:16:12] oh who am i
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:44] uh
[2:16:46] [Music]
[2:16:52] he would go
[2:17:00] i had heard of brother dennis
[2:17:04] before i'd met him
[2:17:06] [Music]
[2:17:08] and then a few harmonies ago i guess
[2:17:11] four or five years ago
[2:17:15] there was an accident in an airplane
[2:17:18] where he lost his son i had just heard
[2:17:21] the name
[2:17:22] didn't know who it was and i met him at
[2:17:26] harmony
[2:17:28] at bacon and i found out that sort of
[2:17:29] people who that's the brother
[2:17:32] so i wanted i went up to to express my
[2:17:36] condolences
[2:17:40] and this is what spoke to me
[2:17:43] when he told me that when he heard of
[2:17:46] the accident all he had and it was his
[2:17:48] son
[2:17:49] and there was another boy and two girls
[2:17:51] in the plane
[2:17:53] that he quickly went to brother wallace
[2:17:56] as quick as he could
[2:17:57] to comfort him
[2:18:01] i'll never ever forget that
[2:18:05] and in his grief for his son he went to
[2:18:09] help
[2:18:10] the brother who lost his
[2:18:11] [Music]
[2:18:14] and when jesus says in your weakness
[2:18:18] i am made strong because he's been there
[2:18:22] already
[2:18:24] and he's able to secure he's able to
[2:18:26] help he's able to rescue
[2:18:29] because he's been there he's walked that
[2:18:30] bath
[2:18:32] when you see the footprints in the sand
[2:18:35] of time
[2:18:36] he's carrying you through that time
[2:18:41] i will say this having six daughters and
[2:18:45] no sense
[2:18:48] i will say this to you fathers and two
[2:18:50] mothers
[2:18:52] don't turn on your children when they
[2:18:54] come back and ask you why
[2:18:58] don't make yourself too godly for them
[2:19:03] they would ask me dad why does a 16 year
[2:19:06] old boy act like this
[2:19:08] and this was my answer you didn't know
[2:19:11] your dad when he was 16.
[2:19:13] i've been there before and that's
[2:19:16] exactly what god told you today
[2:19:18] i've been where you're at i've walked
[2:19:21] where you walked
[2:19:22] i'm bored on the hurt
[2:19:25] the shame the iniquity for you
[2:19:28] i think brother dennis did a good job to
[2:19:30] say don't
[2:19:32] turn from him then he wants
[2:19:35] to show his grace his mercy
[2:19:39] his love because he understands
[2:19:44] that spoke to me in him he knew how he
[2:19:47] was hurting
[2:19:48] he knew how brother wallace was hurting
[2:19:51] and he wanted to go
[2:19:53] comfortably he's a god that loves us
[2:19:57] he's a god that cares so much that he
[2:20:01] took on flesh
[2:20:02] human flesh was able to feel pain
[2:20:05] and sorrow and hurt and he bore
[2:20:09] our shame in our iniquity i shared with
[2:20:12] you in my prayer there
[2:20:13] lord do you understand what it is to be
[2:20:17] forsaken and he said to me did not i cry
[2:20:20] out my father my father why his help
[2:20:22] forsaken me
[2:20:24] and i asked him if he understood foot
[2:20:25] pain when i was going through my surgery
[2:20:27] and all
[2:20:28] and he said we're not those my bloody
[2:20:29] flip footprints
[2:20:31] on the way up to calvary he just said
[2:20:33] yes i do
[2:20:35] and by that i can reach out and draw you
[2:20:38] to myself
[2:20:39] you should love him more than you ever
[2:20:42] thought you thought you loved him before
[2:20:44] how much more that he cared for
[2:20:48] he says i've been there where you at
[2:20:49] brother i i've been there
[2:20:51] and you can overcome like i overcame
[2:20:54] right
[2:20:55] you know he became me so that i might
[2:20:58] become him
[2:21:00] he said i'll come down and i'll show you
[2:21:03] let's sing that once before we go
[2:21:05] he became
[2:21:10] so that i might
[2:21:13] become him
[2:21:17] [Music]
[2:21:21] he
[2:21:25] that became might become him my grace
[2:21:38] so that i through his love could take
[2:21:44] him
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:48] he became me
[2:21:52] so that i might become
[2:21:57] what you say sing that to him in
[2:21:58] appreciation and love back to
[2:22:02] [Music]
[2:22:07] that him might become you
[2:22:11] my grace
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:20] so that i might become you
[2:22:25] by
[2:22:30] you took my place
[2:22:34] so that i through your love
[2:22:38] could take
[2:22:46] me so that i
[2:22:49] [Music]
[2:23:02] in a manger amongst all
[2:23:06] the animal filth and everything so he
[2:23:08] could understand so he could say that
[2:23:10] was me
[2:23:11] that was i appreciate that of him today
[2:23:14] thank you brother dennis for yielding
[2:23:17] yourself
[2:23:18] and allowing god to speak to us
[2:23:21] and i think through this we can love one
[2:23:23] another more
[2:23:24] and we can love him more just a greater
[2:23:27] and a deeper appreciation
[2:23:29] so god bless you as you go
