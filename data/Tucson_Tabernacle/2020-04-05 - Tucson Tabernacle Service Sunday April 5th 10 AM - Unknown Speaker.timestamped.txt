[25:42] Norman Wow
[25:43] it's by much
[25:48] [Music]
[25:58] ciao
[26:01] this mouth
[26:04] shop
[26:07] [Music]
[26:12] it's not my mind
[26:14] [Music]
[26:23] but it's not by my door
[26:32] [Music]
[26:37] shop
[26:45] [Music]
[26:57] if you say under this that's what he
[27:01] said his brother Aaron comes proposed to
[27:05] come and bring the prayer requests and
[27:07] phrases let's sing set your wings
[27:15] let's start with the first verse
[27:18] [Music]
[27:22] there
[27:25] [Music]
[28:28] do not struggle
[28:34] it's bye
[28:36] [Music]
[28:50] it's your name
[28:56] I
[29:00] what
[29:01] [Music]
[29:10] just
[29:15] and by-and-by
[29:20] [Music]
[30:00] [Music]
[30:10] you know it's a choice that you make how
[30:13] you're gonna stand how you're gonna
[30:15] believe what you're going to confess and
[30:19] our confession shouldn't be based on how
[30:21] we're feeling at the moment our
[30:23] confession should be based on what God's
[30:25] Word says because sometimes you feel
[30:27] like you can
[30:29] run through a troop and jump over a wall
[30:32] and sometimes you feel like the wall
[30:34] fell on you
[30:35] but God's Word is still God's Word so
[30:39] that's our confession we have I want to
[30:41] start with a couple of praises maybe
[30:44] encourage you to believe that he's still
[30:46] the same God he's never failed just
[30:50] speaking with them a sister here just
[30:53] earlier as she was talking about how
[30:58] things get applied sometimes and it just
[31:01] reminded me when they brought that woman
[31:03] they had caught in in very act of
[31:05] adultery and he brought her before Jesus
[31:08] and Jesus the only perfect one who could
[31:12] judge that way shows chose to say were
[31:17] thine accusers neither do i condemn thee
[31:20] and i you know sometimes you're your own
[31:23] accuser sometimes you're the one that
[31:25] troubles yourself but take god's word
[31:28] for what he said because i am THE LORD
[31:31] thy God that healeth all thy diseases he
[31:34] goes and all confessed sin all that's
[31:36] laid before him he cleanses he washes
[31:39] he's still the same yesterday we got a
[31:42] praise hear from sister sister Barbara
[31:46] Yarborough about her son Jeffrey in
[31:48] assists I want to give the Lord all the
[31:51] credit for bringing Jeffrey home from
[31:53] the hospital after
[31:54] therefore over six weeks in February he
[31:57] fell and had a brain bleed to brain
[31:59] bleeds actually and had to have surgery
[32:02] after being after being in intensive
[32:04] care for two weeks or more he was sent
[32:07] to rehab order he developed pneumonia
[32:09] and was sent back to the hospital he has
[32:12] been in ICU for over two weeks but
[32:14] praise the Lord on his birthday which
[32:17] was April 1st he was released and Jill
[32:20] was able to take him home where he lives
[32:21] with her we give the Lord all the praise
[32:25] for the answer to prayer amen he's still
[32:29] the same yesterday today and then my
[32:31] daughter Nina sent this one this morning
[32:33] she attends a church there in Wichita
[32:35] Kansas with brother James Pinkston and
[32:38] brother James son-in-law was one of nine
[32:41] cardiologists at the hospital in
[32:42] Indianapolis they have had over 100 or
[32:46] so patients with a quarter coronavirus
[32:49] the nine cardiologists had to be tested
[32:52] for the virus eight of them came back
[32:53] positive and he was the only one that
[32:56] didn't because prayer was getting now
[33:00] for those other eight we asked God to be
[33:02] merciful to them too but we know he
[33:05] watches over his so my niece Felicia
[33:08] they put in a prayer request for her as
[33:10] she works in the hospital and was
[33:12] treating those with the corona virus and
[33:14] she came down with some symptoms also
[33:17] but after the time had passed they found
[33:19] out she didn't have the virus so we
[33:22] appreciate God watching over all of us I
[33:24] did not get any specific prayer requests
[33:27] but there where you are if you can and
[33:29] you will believe and just say Lord you
[33:32] know my name in Venice bow our heads and
[33:33] pray Lord me there's not a situation too
[33:37] great a particular something that could
[33:41] trouble us Lord that you wouldn't be
[33:43] aware don't have the answer in the
[33:45] solution for it Lord and maybe it's just
[33:48] sometimes that we're either struggling
[33:51] within ourselves and maybe we're filled
[33:54] with with regrets and it hurts and or
[33:58] we're feeling unworthy today Lord in the
[34:00] same Lord I'm such a failure I don't
[34:02] even
[34:02] I'm not even worthy to ask you to talk
[34:05] to you the order
[34:06] father it's things Lord that sometimes
[34:09] maybe we don't even have the words to
[34:11] say to you Lord what we have need of
[34:12] can't explain it but you know the very
[34:15] heart of every one you know the
[34:17] situation they're in you know the things
[34:20] that they face Lord Lord there have been
[34:22] many who have lost their income through
[34:24] the loss of work at this time maybe
[34:27] getting nervous and worried and
[34:28] wondering how the bills are gonna be
[34:30] paid Lord but you're still God ruled
[34:33] over all things Lord and we're gonna
[34:34] confess that for each one whatever the
[34:37] situation is Lord made their faith take
[34:40] hold of your word Lord so many instances
[34:43] through the scriptures that we could
[34:44] look and see Lord when it seemed
[34:46] impossible when there was a Red Sea
[34:49] before them and mountains on both sides
[34:51] and Pharaohs army behind them you just
[34:55] told Moses speak that which you have
[34:57] need of Lord let each one of us take
[34:59] that same faith Lord speak to the
[35:01] situation whatever it is Lord and then
[35:04] begin to thank you and praise you and
[35:06] give you tests give testimony lord help
[35:08] us to set our wings on the winds of
[35:11] faith today we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[35:13] name

[50:19] Isaiah chapter 59 and verse we're just
[50:22] going to read one verse Isaiah 59 and
[50:24] verse 19 amen
[50:32] Isaiah chapter 59 and verse 19 one just
[50:44] one scripture reading here the Bible
[50:47] says so shall they fear the name of the
[50:51] Lord from the west and his glory from
[50:54] the rising of the Sun when the enemy
[50:56] shall come in like a flood the Spirit of
[50:59] the Lord shall lift up a standard

[51:28] Christ's name Amen amen you can be
[51:31] seated there at church I'd like to you
[51:33] just to look here just for a moment when
[51:35] we say this word standard and I believe
[51:39] that this word standard when it speaks
[51:41] of in verse 19 he says when the enemy
[51:44] shall come in like a flood the Spirit of
[51:48] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[51:50] against him just to say this I just got
[51:53] a note here reminder
[51:57] it looked like we're in Tucson and we're
[51:59] at church but we're really not this is
[52:01] just the power of technology amen so I'm
[52:04] here in a live studio just preaching to
[52:06] you today so I just wanted to clear up
[52:08] the confusion in case some of you are
[52:10] thinking that I'm there in person but I
[52:12] am there in spirit
[52:14] amen god bless you so when the enemy
[52:16] shall come in like a flood the Spirit of
[52:19] the Lord shall raise up a standard
[52:22] against him this word standard is such
[52:25] an important word in the age that were
[52:27] for are we living in an age where it's
[52:31] not the age of the seed it's not the age
[52:33] of infancy but we're living in the age
[52:36] of the maturing of all seeds there was a
[52:40] time even in this lady I see in church
[52:42] age where there was an infancy or a seed
[52:45] Foreman or an origination and where
[52:48] things were in seed form things both
[52:51] ecumenically
[52:51] in the demonic realm and the physical
[52:54] realm things were in the seed form or
[52:58] you could call them in the infant stage
[53:00] but let me just say this you're not
[53:03] living in the infant stage today but
[53:05] we're living in them in the age of the
[53:08] maturing of all seeds God's kingdom is
[53:12] maturing God's purposes maturing and we
[53:15] see Satan's purpose and Satan's Kingdom
[53:18] is at its zenith or at its climax
[53:21] Matthew chapter 13 you don't have to
[53:24] turn I'll just read it quickly Matthew
[53:27] chapter 13 and verse 24 it says another
[53:30] parable put he forth unto them saying
[53:32] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[53:35] man which sowed good seed in his field
[53:38] but while men slept his enemy came and
[53:41] sowed tares among the wheat and went his
[53:44] way but when the blades sprung up and
[53:47] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[53:49] tares also in verse 30 they Jesus this
[53:52] is the words when they said what about
[53:54] the tares and what about the wheats that
[53:56] are growing and coming to maturity and
[53:58] Jesus says let them both grow together
[54:01] until the harvest and in the time of
[54:05] harvest I will say to the Reapers gather
[54:08] you together first the tares
[54:11] and bind them in bundles to burn them
[54:14] but gather the wheat into my barn and so
[54:18] we're living in that prophecy of this
[54:20] scripture of what we just read here
[54:22] we're living at the climax of all of the
[54:25] tares and all of the wheats that have
[54:26] been growing down through all of the
[54:28] ages even in our own specific Lady
[54:31] Essene church age that we're living in
[54:33] now there is a maturity of all seeds
[54:36] you're living in the culmination or the
[54:39] fruition as the song says it's
[54:42] manifesting time the fruits are on the
[54:45] vine and so it's it's clearly a
[54:48] manifesting age or a time of maturity of
[54:52] all things and let me say this all seeds
[54:54] are coming to maturity we're living in
[54:58] the zenith or the climax of both Satan's
[55:01] Eden and God's kingdom notice that God
[55:05] says I'm not going to disrupt what the
[55:08] reap what the what the sower who sowed
[55:10] the bad seed I'm not gonna disrupt it
[55:13] I'm gonna let him sew it I'm not going
[55:16] to stop him I'm not going to hinder him
[55:18] I'm going to just let him continue to
[55:21] build his kingdom and surely friends he
[55:24] has been building his kingdom in the
[55:27] world in the nation the Spirit that's on
[55:29] the nation the spirits on the world is a
[55:31] representation of the maturity of
[55:34] Satan's Eden and the maturity of his
[55:38] purposes and his plans there's nothing
[55:40] that's happening in the world today that
[55:43] you see that has just happenstance or
[55:45] just by chance but everything is being
[55:48] led or being controlled or influenced by
[55:51] spirits whether we realize that or not
[55:54] our life on a daily basis is controlled
[55:57] by spirits it's controlled by an
[56:00] influence there's something that is
[56:02] motivating you every day you wake up and
[56:05] every time you get out of bed and you go
[56:07] about your life there's a spirit that's
[56:09] motivating you and we're living at the
[56:11] maturing of those spirits we're living
[56:14] at the maturing of that purpose we're
[56:16] living in the climax of God's purpose
[56:19] from the beginning and the Serpent's
[56:23] purpose
[56:24] from the beginning we're living in an
[56:27] age where everyone in this age is
[56:30] claiming to have the truth everyone is
[56:33] claiming to be right you take the word
[56:36] just the word standard and but here
[56:38] here's what we know about the Word of
[56:40] God there's only one standard there's
[56:43] only God doesn't have many metrics he
[56:45] doesn't have many measuring lines
[56:47] he doesn't have multiple books he
[56:49] doesn't have multiple evolving thoughts
[56:51] but his original thought was a perfect
[56:57] and and a perfect purpose and God said
[57:01] I'm going to have a standard hey doesn't
[57:04] have many ways to be right there is only
[57:06] one right way there is only one right
[57:09] word jesus said I am the way Muslims
[57:13] claim they have the truth Buddha claims
[57:15] they have the truth but Jesus stands in
[57:17] the middle of all of them and says I'm
[57:20] the only truth I'm the only way I'm the
[57:23] only door so so what we understand says
[57:28] it's right is right many different
[57:31] religions in the world today have a
[57:33] different approach that they claim that
[57:35] they have the right way or a different
[57:37] people have different approaches to what
[57:39] they believe is right and what they
[57:41] believe is wrong and in the age that we
[57:42] live in it's an age of relativism where
[57:45] everybody truth is just relative its it
[57:48] depends on what country you're from it
[57:50] depends on what state you're in it
[57:51] depends on where you're from what nation
[57:53] you're born and it'll determine what's
[57:55] right in what's wrong but God said I'm
[57:57] gonna have a word that it's going to
[57:59] judge the entire world brother Branham
[58:02] said he can't be just unless he has a
[58:04] standard to judge the world by and so
[58:08] we're living in an age if I could say
[58:10] this we have a world that is filled with
[58:14] different denominations and different
[58:16] denominational ideas and and the
[58:19] opinions of men my brother my sister
[58:21] what we are ripe with in the in the in
[58:24] the world that we live in is today is
[58:27] the opinions of people we're living in
[58:31] an age where the knowledge the Bible
[58:33] says knowledge would increase you you
[58:37] see the information age that we live in
[58:39] it's no accident that that the internet
[58:41] was discovered in our age there's no
[58:44] accident that because it was a maturing
[58:46] of a seed it was a maturing of the
[58:48] fourth dimension and so it's no accident
[58:50] that you're living in the age where man
[58:53] has more access to information than he's
[58:55] ever had at a moment he can he can
[58:58] google something and have an answer to
[59:00] his questions questions that people have
[59:02] asked for years and now we can just go
[59:04] and we can have information and so we're
[59:08] living in the age the climax of the Age
[59:11] of information or the climax of the age
[59:13] of man's ideas opinions are endless in
[59:19] the age that we live in
[59:21] you might google a topic and you might
[59:23] you know you know and we'll but when you
[59:26] google that topic no matter what you're
[59:28] googling you're getting an aggregated
[59:30] consensus of information that stems from
[59:35] opinion do you realize that now I know
[59:39] we've almost deified in our world Google
[59:41] and you know just google it whatever
[59:44] Google says and we can become so it's no
[59:47] accident friend I'm not preaching
[59:48] against the internet today that the only
[59:50] reason we're able to preach to you right
[59:51] now is through the internet but it's the
[59:53] tree of knowledge of good and evil and
[59:56] so what you're what you're getting is an
[59:59] age to where people are becoming so
[1:00:01] information field they're so information
[1:00:05] field but they have no revelation let me
[1:00:07] say this today the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:00:09] does not have information she has
[1:00:12] revelation God's kingdom would not be
[1:00:14] built on information Satan's Kingdom
[1:00:16] would God Satan brother Madison Satan
[1:00:19] has a scientific economy but God has his
[1:00:22] mystic body the mystical body of Jesus
[1:00:25] Christ that doesn't depend on science
[1:00:27] they depend upon
[1:00:29] halation and so we were endless in the
[1:00:33] ages that we live in you can google a
[1:00:35] topic and you can become almost to where
[1:00:37] the Google just anything you you know
[1:00:39] anything you type in as well as whatever
[1:00:40] that says you know no chance Google
[1:00:42] could be wrong but what you realize is
[1:00:45] that is that our search result is just
[1:00:47] an aggregated consensus of information
[1:00:51] that is based its foundation is the
[1:00:54] opinion of man some professional and
[1:00:59] some not so much professional as we
[1:01:02] learn so the world today the age today
[1:01:05] is littered with the opinions of people
[1:01:08] it's it's littered with the with the
[1:01:11] ideas of man old but let me just break
[1:01:13] through with the word here today and say
[1:01:16] there is only one opinion that matters
[1:01:18] my opinion doesn't count your opinion
[1:01:21] doesn't count there's only one space
[1:01:23] there's only one truth and that's the
[1:01:26] word of God my brother my sister that's
[1:01:28] this prophetic book that is controlling
[1:01:30] your life it's controlling the white
[1:01:32] house it's controlling all the nations
[1:01:36] of the earth there's only one mind that
[1:01:40] matters and that's the mind of God let
[1:01:43] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:01:45] Christ Jesus we live in a world that is
[1:01:48] so sympathetic to every opinion such
[1:01:52] such a climate of sympathy to where
[1:01:55] they're sympathetic to it
[1:01:59] except Christians but they're
[1:02:01] sympathetic to every idea every standard
[1:02:04] of moral but here's what we know by the
[1:02:06] Bible there's not more than one right
[1:02:09] answer there's not more than one
[1:02:11] standard there's only one right way and
[1:02:14] there's only one right choice there's
[1:02:17] not more than one right way everyone's
[1:02:19] looking for some kind of measuring line
[1:02:22] or metric that they can use of what's
[1:02:25] right and what's wrong
[1:02:26] you know another Jordan you should have
[1:02:28] that if if it works on the power point
[1:02:31] good if not those at home can just
[1:02:33] listen in but notice what the prophet of
[1:02:36] God says here
[1:02:44] you
[1:03:26] or he would be unjust to let us go now
[1:03:30] and live this life without a standard to
[1:03:34] be judged by who would be right where
[1:03:37] could you tell what was right there has
[1:03:40] to be a standard oh my friends the world
[1:03:45] has their own standard of love the way
[1:03:48] of looking at everything they have their
[1:03:49] own standard of what truth is they have
[1:03:51] their own approach okay so let me ask
[1:03:54] you a question can we use the world as
[1:03:56] the standard to judge can we use the
[1:03:59] world as our standard to live by I would
[1:04:02] say absolutely not no way that the world
[1:04:06] is ever changing the world is constantly
[1:04:09] changing
[1:04:10] you look at just over they they're
[1:04:12] constantly modifying what they believe
[1:04:15] there's there's that over just the last
[1:04:17] hundred years you know I was just
[1:04:19] watching a videotape here that was
[1:04:21] shared to me and you can its own YouTube
[1:04:23] of I think it's Kota a walk through New
[1:04:26] York in 1911 and someone has taken and
[1:04:28] put old black and white film of New York
[1:04:31] City in 1911 and and there's there's
[1:04:34] color to it and there's sound and and
[1:04:36] and and and the sound of horse and buggy
[1:04:38] and they've they've digitized it in a
[1:04:41] way to get 60 frames per second in 4k
[1:04:43] and it's it's amazing you should you
[1:04:45] should watch it it it was shocking to me
[1:04:47] to see just if you look at the standard
[1:04:50] of what a man dressed like and what a
[1:04:52] woman dressed like just to today it's
[1:04:55] there's this it's a stark contrast
[1:04:57] between the two just in that little bit
[1:05:00] of time little over a hundred years of
[1:05:02] time the world is constantly evolving
[1:05:04] and changing there wasn't a man on the
[1:05:06] street that didn't have a suit on I'm
[1:05:08] not talking about Christians I'm talking
[1:05:10] about man everyone wore a suit every
[1:05:12] woman weren't wore a dress all the way
[1:05:15] down flowing down passed all the way due
[1:05:17] to their ankles there were such a hey
[1:05:19] and now today everything is so casual
[1:05:22] and it doesn't really matter and you
[1:05:23] just go comfortable but the world is
[1:05:26] constantly evolving the world is
[1:05:28] constantly changing what they believe
[1:05:31] what they believe just 40 years ago as
[1:05:34] of today is completely different than
[1:05:37] what you what you what you sweat you
[1:05:40] see today so what they let me say this
[1:05:43] what they used to call wrong
[1:05:46] they now call right and what they used
[1:05:50] to call right they now call wrong I mean
[1:05:54] think about this my brother my sister
[1:05:55] it's completely backwards uh and if what
[1:05:59] they let me say this what they used to
[1:06:01] call right they now call wrong or
[1:06:04] old-fashioned or out of sync or out of
[1:06:07] touch or not relevant or the world's
[1:06:10] changed and you're just old-fashioned
[1:06:12] your own timey and you know you're not
[1:06:14] you're not relevant that's the word
[1:06:16] today let me say this I might not be
[1:06:17] relevant but I'm revel a 'td I'll take
[1:06:19] revelation of irrelevance any day
[1:06:21] because relevance is subjective the very
[1:06:24] word relevant it means that it's
[1:06:25] subjective so the standard of the world
[1:06:28] today is constantly changing
[1:06:31] they had no absolute they have no type
[1:06:34] post they have no absolute have no typos
[1:06:38] they have no sure footing you look at
[1:06:40] political the political world today
[1:06:42] politics are constantly changing uh
[1:06:44] would politician as of you today and you
[1:06:47] go back and he's running for an office
[1:06:49] well well we found a tape over here
[1:06:51] where just a few years ago you voted for
[1:06:53] this and now you're voting against it
[1:06:54] and over here you voted for that because
[1:06:56] it was calm
[1:06:59] everyone changes they just
[1:07:05] going down the drain I want to go
[1:07:08] against the flow I want to rise up out
[1:07:11] of this dimension into a heavenly world
[1:07:13] into a heavenly atmosphere okay so I
[1:07:17] want to go a little bit further here
[1:07:18] just getting some feedback here brother
[1:07:20] Jordan that when we go to the power
[1:07:22] point it's stutter and so maybe would us
[1:07:23] would have stay on me here just for a
[1:07:25] moment so the world is just constantly
[1:07:28] changing my brother my sister the world
[1:07:31] is not just changing that's almost
[1:07:33] shallow just to say that let me say it
[1:07:35] this way it's a changing it's it's
[1:07:39] corrupting it's declining so brother
[1:07:43] Matt then what should we use should we
[1:07:45] use the church hardly huh
[1:07:47] the church can't be the measuring line
[1:07:49] of what how God's going to judge the
[1:07:51] world the church is constantly evolving
[1:07:54] there could even what they believe just
[1:07:56] 100 years ago they have changed their
[1:07:58] standards they're an ever-changing
[1:08:00] measuring line they have watered down
[1:08:02] the truth of the word of God at the end
[1:08:05] of the day it's just whatever anyone
[1:08:07] thinks whatever the expert thinks
[1:08:09] whatever the doctorate person with a
[1:08:11] theology degree we hatch them out of
[1:08:13] seminary and all they're just the
[1:08:14] experts on everything they know Greek
[1:08:16] they do seven different languages and
[1:08:17] they can interpret the Hebrew they know
[1:08:19] textual variants so they can study the
[1:08:21] days of creation they can argue with the
[1:08:23] atheists the minds of the church world
[1:08:26] today are more educated than they've
[1:08:27] ever been and they're more lost and far
[1:08:30] away from what the truth the true
[1:08:32] standard of God's Word ever was to be
[1:08:35] it's just what every one thinks is right
[1:08:40] I want you to turn to judges chapter 21
[1:08:44] and I want you to turn there I'll give
[1:08:47] you just a minute just to turn notice
[1:08:49] this is judges chapter 21 verse 25 and
[1:08:53] I'm just gonna interject here something
[1:08:56] just for a moment and I want to look at
[1:08:58] it here judges chapter 121 verse 25 this
[1:09:02] is this is I think per so prophetic of
[1:09:06] the age that were the cycle that we're
[1:09:09] in in the end the time where the clock
[1:09:11] is where the hour hand in the minute
[1:09:14] of the age that we're living in and so I
[1:09:18] want you to turn there just just if you
[1:09:20] could judges chapter 21 and look at
[1:09:23] verse 25 it says in those days there was
[1:09:27] no king in Israel and every man did that
[1:09:32] which was right in his own eyes you see
[1:09:38] without a king before a king was a
[1:09:40] prophet it was a seer he was that's why
[1:09:42] the Bible says with where there's no
[1:09:44] vision that word vision directly
[1:09:46] correlates to a prophet because the
[1:09:48] Prophet is the seven eyes of God he says
[1:09:50] there's seven eyes and they went through
[1:09:52] seeing throughout the entire world a
[1:09:54] prophet has a gift I'm not talking about
[1:09:56] just the gift of prophecy I'm talking
[1:09:57] about the messengers that's spoken of a
[1:10:00] revelation for every age they were the
[1:10:01] seers they were the eyes they brought
[1:10:03] illumination in the middle of darkness
[1:10:06] they were the light and so so this is
[1:10:08] what the Bible says where there's no
[1:10:10] vision where there's no prophetic
[1:10:12] understanding where there's no prophetic
[1:10:14] revelation the people perish you know
[1:10:17] the scripture where there's no vision
[1:10:18] the people perish they put off they cast
[1:10:21] off restraint he says every man in those
[1:10:23] days did that which was right in his own
[1:10:27] eyes my brother and my sister you're
[1:10:30] living in the age where man's opinion
[1:10:32] has became so exalted that it's just
[1:10:35] like the gospel it's the age of opinion
[1:10:40] everyone expressing their opinion
[1:10:42] everyone we have social media platforms
[1:10:45] and blogs that or man can just spew out
[1:10:48] the thoughts the fodder of his own mind
[1:10:51] and what he thinks but here's the
[1:10:52] problem with man's mind that there's
[1:10:55] nothing more unstable than the mind of
[1:10:58] man a fallen man who's whose whose mind
[1:11:01] is subject to it to to experiences his
[1:11:05] his opinions are subjected to
[1:11:07] experiences his opinions are subjected
[1:11:09] to emotions their subjecting to
[1:11:11] influences their subjective to the
[1:11:13] friends he's around they're subjected to
[1:11:15] the education he's received and then he
[1:11:17] he calls up his opinion but what's it
[1:11:19] based upon so man becomes his own
[1:11:23] interpreter man becomes his own and Turk
[1:11:29] the Bible says he becomes his own filter
[1:11:33] his own moral compass I'm sure you know
[1:11:39] we can say here today our standards
[1:11:41] everyone's standards would be it would
[1:11:43] be a little different than each others
[1:11:44] you know your standard would be
[1:11:46] different than mine cleanliness of homes
[1:11:48] could could vary in standard and what
[1:11:49] you think is nice may not be what I
[1:11:51] think is nice what you think is good may
[1:11:53] not be what I think is good everyone's
[1:11:54] going to have their own opinions but our
[1:11:56] standards are a little different
[1:12:00] I'm a different nation different state
[1:12:03] that you're born in every everybody's
[1:12:06] gonna is going to be raised with a
[1:12:07] little bit different standard but the
[1:12:10] reality is my brother my sister when it
[1:12:12] comes to the important things there's
[1:12:13] only one truth there's only one way
[1:12:17] there's only one Lord there's only one
[1:12:20] faith there's only one baptism it's not
[1:12:24] millions of opinions but Bob but you say
[1:12:28] why brother Matt why can't it be the way
[1:12:29] because God said I'll judge the world by
[1:12:31] one opinion one Jesus Christ and Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ is not just the man of Galilee of
[1:12:38] Nazareth of 2000 years ago of a
[1:12:40] sunday-school Jesus but he's alive and
[1:12:42] well he's in you say where is Jesus
[1:12:44] today in his word Jesus the word well I
[1:12:49] just believe in Jesus well which one
[1:12:51] which version which version do you
[1:12:53] believe in but there's one version
[1:12:55] there's one truth this is what this is
[1:12:58] what Christians have stood for from the
[1:13:01] beginning this is why and Jude he says
[1:13:04] they says there's certain being crept
[1:13:06] out of the where's who were before of
[1:13:08] old ordained to this condemnation with
[1:13:10] cunningness and craftiness and jude says
[1:13:12] we must earnestly contend for the faith
[1:13:14] that was once delivered to the Saints
[1:13:17] there's one standard let me say this my
[1:13:19] brother God doesn't care what you think
[1:13:21] and he doesn't care what I think he
[1:13:23] doesn't care about our opinions I'll
[1:13:26] give a word God says I'll give a word
[1:13:28] and it'll be an unchanging standard
[1:13:30] it'll be an unchanging word it won't be
[1:13:33] dynamic it won't evolve it'll be a plumb
[1:13:36] line it'll be a standard it'll be a
[1:13:39] straight and narrow way one standard one
[1:13:42] way this is why it's so important that
[1:13:45] we keep the plumb line straight that we
[1:13:49] keep the Word of God based upon the
[1:13:51] Bible no matter what we believe we base
[1:13:54] it upon this I don't care what your
[1:13:55] opinion is if something brother Branham
[1:13:57] said it better be based upon the Word of
[1:13:59] God because this was brother branham's
[1:14:00] absolute and it's my absolute you say
[1:14:03] what is your absolute where the Matt the
[1:14:04] same things the Prophet was when he
[1:14:06] preached them with a message absolutely
[1:14:08] held bouquets black leather-bound Bible
[1:14:10] and said this is the only absolute God
[1:14:13] ever gave to man your
[1:14:14] some it better not be on anything else
[1:14:16] better not be on man better not be a
[1:14:18] melon of denominational an opinion on a
[1:14:20] doctrine it better be based upon the
[1:14:22] Word of God to keep our ideas and
[1:14:25] opinion out of it to keep the word pure
[1:14:28] it's the only way to bring forth life
[1:14:32] and liberty is to have the true standard
[1:14:36] the true pattern notice what brother
[1:14:38] Branham says in the pattern of the Word
[1:14:40] of God and you can try if you want the
[1:14:42] PowerPoint I suppose if you if you think
[1:14:44] it's stuttering then we'll just keep it
[1:14:46] I'm just gonna read them for you here
[1:14:48] just for a minute listen what brother
[1:14:49] Branham says out of the ephesian church
[1:14:50] age he says thus what the church was at
[1:14:54] Pentecost
[1:14:56] now notice not 1906 Azusa Street not not
[1:15:02] not not you know daddy seymour and in
[1:15:06] the Welsh revival and you know not not
[1:15:09] that that's not the Pentecost we're
[1:15:10] talking about we're talking about the
[1:15:12] book of Acts pinnacles what the church
[1:15:14] was listen to the Prophet thus what the
[1:15:17] church was at Pentecost is the standard
[1:15:21] that is the pattern there is no other
[1:15:27] pattern no matter what the scholars say
[1:15:30] God has not changed that pattern what
[1:15:34] God did it Pentecost he has to keep on
[1:15:38] doing until the church ages close so
[1:15:42] that that what was that first Pentecost
[1:15:44] to church it was the seed it was the
[1:15:47] Alpha I'm the alpha
[1:15:48] I'm the Omega the Ephesian age would be
[1:15:50] the Alpha it would be the beginnings of
[1:15:52] everything that seed that would go into
[1:15:55] the ground and come through seven church
[1:15:56] ages until now we have the that we we go
[1:16:00] back to what we go back to the seed
[1:16:01] again it's went through the stalk it's
[1:16:04] went through the tussle it's went
[1:16:05] through all every generation and
[1:16:07] everything it was all a restoration it
[1:16:09] was all a framework but it was all to go
[1:16:11] to the original seed to be harvested
[1:16:14] again remember Jesus says leave the
[1:16:16] tares with the wheat but I'll come and
[1:16:18] harvest
[1:16:18] what is that harvest it's a rapture it's
[1:16:20] the latter rain what is the latter rain
[1:16:22] it's the rapture rain and we've received
[1:16:24] that rain already to get us ready for a
[1:16:26] rapture to be harvested
[1:16:28] he says not now this is the pergamene
[1:16:31] church age if a man is born of the word
[1:16:33] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:16:35] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[1:16:37] which liveth and abideth forever
[1:16:39] first Peter 1:23 he will produce the
[1:16:42] word the fruit or works of his life will
[1:16:46] be a product of the kind of seed or life
[1:16:48] that is in him his works therefore will
[1:16:51] be scriptural oh what an indictment this
[1:16:55] truth is going to be against this
[1:16:56] Pergamon age
[1:17:02] that's one and his and he says and in
[1:17:05] his hand the sharp sword with two edges
[1:17:07] the word of God and that word would
[1:17:10] judge us until the last day in fact
[1:17:14] notice this he says in fact the word is
[1:17:16] judging even now for it is a discerner
[1:17:19] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:17:23] heart
[1:17:23] it cuts asunder the carnal from the
[1:17:27] spiritual it makes us live in epistles
[1:17:30] read and known of all men otis further
[1:17:33] he says I know thy works if a man fears
[1:17:36] that he might not please God let him
[1:17:39] fulfill the word if a man wonders if he
[1:17:42] will hear those words well done my good
[1:17:44] and faithful servant let him fulfill the
[1:17:46] word of God in his life and he assuredly
[1:17:50] and assuredly he will hear those words
[1:17:53] of praise notice the word of truth was
[1:17:57] the criterion then it is the criterion
[1:18:01] now there isn't another standard there
[1:18:04] isn't another plumb line as the world is
[1:18:06] going to be judged by one Christ Jesus
[1:18:10] even so it is going to be judged by the
[1:18:13] word if a man wants to know how he is
[1:18:17] making out let him do his James
[1:18:19] suggested look into the mirror of God's
[1:18:23] word glory so man it would be producing
[1:18:28] this is what brother Branham said what
[1:18:30] is the evidence of the Holy Ghost to
[1:18:32] produce the word to wear your word says
[1:18:34] a man to every word of God
[1:18:36] I thought brother Branham said a man was
[1:18:38] was he you know I thought the baptism
[1:18:41] the Holy Ghost the proof the evidence
[1:18:42] was saying a man to the Word of God my
[1:18:45] brother - not an intellectual man it's
[1:18:47] your life what does a man mean it means
[1:18:48] so be it when was Mary saying a man -
[1:18:51] the Word of God when she brought forth
[1:18:54] the child when she brought forth Christ
[1:18:56] when the word could take place and she
[1:18:59] could but she could produce the word
[1:19:01] when your life produces the word that's
[1:19:04] when you're saying amen to every word I
[1:19:06] say Lord let my life produce the word
[1:19:09] let me say a man to every word of God
[1:19:11] it's not just saying a man it's
[1:19:14] producing
[1:19:14] the Word of God in your life I say God
[1:19:16] let me produce the word let it go beyond
[1:19:20] my confession and let it manifest in a
[1:19:23] life in the fruits of my life for that's
[1:19:25] the only thing that's really important
[1:19:27] anyways the fruits are works of his life
[1:19:30] so what will you you say but the mat
[1:19:33] what will you produce you will produce
[1:19:36] your life will be a product of the seed
[1:19:40] that's in you as brother Branham said
[1:19:44] every seed is bringing for every seed
[1:19:46] will bring forth after its own kind a
[1:19:48] prophet of God said if I had the spirit
[1:19:50] of Beethoven he said I would I would
[1:19:52] play music I write music if I had the
[1:19:55] spirit of John Dillinger I'd be a
[1:19:56] gunslinger
[1:19:57] he says old but if I have the Spirit of
[1:20:00] Christ I'll be like Christ as the song
[1:20:03] says when they see me
[1:20:05] let them see Jesus oh I trust that's
[1:20:08] your prayer today when they see me let
[1:20:10] them see Jesus let it be the product of
[1:20:13] my life a written epistle read and known
[1:20:17] of all men I pray that your prayer here
[1:20:18] today your life line your life up with
[1:20:21] the plumb line the standard because when
[1:20:25] the enemy comes rushing in like a flood
[1:20:27] the Spirit of God raises a standard
[1:20:30] against him he raises up a standard the
[1:20:34] Bible says they're groping the world is
[1:20:36] groping in darkness it's getting smarter
[1:20:39] and more educated it thinks it's smarter
[1:20:41] than it ever was before but where the
[1:20:44] human rotten the human mind today has
[1:20:46] reached such a precipice it's so highly
[1:20:49] esteemed the thoughts and opinions of
[1:20:51] man it's the age of information it's the
[1:20:54] advent of blogs it's the advent of the
[1:20:56] of the internet a blog to give a man a
[1:20:59] platform to esteem his own thoughts his
[1:21:02] own thinking is the age of self
[1:21:04] validation and we're validated today
[1:21:07] when we have an opinion that lines up
[1:21:09] with the rest of the world
[1:21:10] oh what a perversion my brother and my
[1:21:12] sister let our validation only being
[1:21:15] where we stand in Christ not where
[1:21:17] though how the world looks at us today
[1:21:20] man is literally worshiping his own
[1:21:24] thinking you got to be careful I read a
[1:21:27] sign of impact
[1:21:28] me so well you've heard of the statement
[1:21:30] don't always believe what you hear don't
[1:21:32] always believe what you see someone had
[1:21:34] a bumper sticker and it said don't
[1:21:35] always believe what you believe art I
[1:21:38] said don't always believe what you think
[1:21:39] don't always believe what you think cuz
[1:21:42] you might be wrong Oh
[1:21:46] today the Internet has produced an age
[1:21:49] of DIY do-it-yourself
[1:21:51] everyone just doesn't I need a plumber
[1:21:54] well I can just google that I can
[1:21:56] YouTube that you know I can I can just
[1:21:58] go look at what you know I
[1:22:02] it
[1:22:04] I'm not preaching against that I'm just
[1:22:05] trying to get you to understand here
[1:22:07] there's a reason for that I don't I
[1:22:09] don't any electrician I can give you
[1:22:11] tube that and then you burn your house
[1:22:13] down then you realize you you're not as
[1:22:15] smart as you think you were I don't need
[1:22:17] a pastor I can fix my own problems I
[1:22:20] could fix my own just give me a preacher
[1:22:21] just give me a man oh preach to me just
[1:22:24] give me some where I could go and
[1:22:25] fulfill a religious duty it's an age of
[1:22:28] do-it-yourself it's an age I don't need
[1:22:31] a church I can use either I don't need I
[1:22:33] don't need a prophet at my own I'm own
[1:22:35] interpreter I'm my own interpretation
[1:22:36] but the world the Word says you're
[1:22:38] groping in darkness you may think you're
[1:22:40] in light that was the the judgement the
[1:22:43] rebuke to this age was that that you you
[1:22:46] say you're rich and increased with Goods
[1:22:48] and have need of nothing and knowest
[1:22:49] thou not you're blind you're wretched
[1:22:52] your miserable your poor and you don't
[1:22:53] even know it you think you're smarter
[1:22:57] the world thinks they're smarter than
[1:22:58] ever before
[1:22:59] they think they're successful and
[1:23:01] fulfilled all but then suddenly here
[1:23:04] comes a virus and suddenly here comes a
[1:23:07] disease and it swipes through the nation
[1:23:09] and then what do you have you have all
[1:23:10] those intellectual people huh we really
[1:23:12] don't know there's really no towels or
[1:23:14] really no tests and everyone's looking
[1:23:15] to the experts everyone's looking to dr.
[1:23:18] Fowler everybody's looking at good man
[1:23:20] good educated man they're doing
[1:23:21] everything they can do god bless them
[1:23:23] I'm glad we have them I'm praying for
[1:23:25] those men who are in that in the I'm
[1:23:28] praying for men like dr. Falchi men like
[1:23:30] the the people who are studying the
[1:23:33] antidote for this disease I pray for him
[1:23:35] God uses them God uses vaccines God uses
[1:23:37] medicine it's way you but man doesn't
[1:23:39] heal the brother madam said man can't
[1:23:41] heal anything any doctor good doctor
[1:23:43] tell you that man can't heal even the
[1:23:46] medicine itself was an agent that God
[1:23:48] uses but God brings the healing so I
[1:23:51] brother branham said you take a dead man
[1:23:52] and he said if he had a cut in his arm
[1:23:54] and a big sore cut when he when he died
[1:23:57] he said if he's dead you go ahead and
[1:23:59] rub that on augment on there
[1:24:01] he says rub that medicine on there give
[1:24:03] him every drug you could think of give
[1:24:04] him every vitamin give him there he said
[1:24:06] that cut will never heal it'll stay just
[1:24:08] like it was because he's dead he said
[1:24:10] but what what we realize is is that it's
[1:24:12] the life inside of the man
[1:24:15] that heals him the drugs and that the
[1:24:18] medicine and the and the ointments are
[1:24:20] only an assistant to the life that's
[1:24:23] inside of him life is what brings
[1:24:24] healing so you think people think
[1:24:28] they're more successful more fulfilled
[1:24:30] but you have suddenly you have a disease
[1:24:32] that strikes the world and then everyone
[1:24:33] realizes how helpless we really are it's
[1:24:38] an age of insanity of total insanity
[1:24:40] total addiction broken on the inside on
[1:24:45] the outside you see a veneer of success
[1:24:47] on the outside you see a veneer of rich
[1:24:50] increase with goods but on the inside
[1:24:52] they're searching for answers on the
[1:24:54] inside brother madam said it's like a
[1:24:55] boy whistling through a graveyard and
[1:24:57] the world thinks they've been whistling
[1:24:59] through a graveyard they're thinking
[1:25:01] that they're all right that their that
[1:25:03] their scientific age will produce all
[1:25:05] the answers and just one little plague
[1:25:07] strike some and look at the panic and
[1:25:09] pandemonium that's in the world today
[1:25:11] what an age what is this age of
[1:25:14] information produced if we're smarter
[1:25:17] than we've ever been if we're more
[1:25:18] intellectual than we've ever been if we
[1:25:20] understand more than we've ever
[1:25:22] understood if it's a greater age than
[1:25:23] ever before let me ask you what has that
[1:25:26] this age produced its produced of people
[1:25:29] a world that is more addicted than
[1:25:32] they've ever been before people that are
[1:25:35] more depressed with filled with anxiety
[1:25:37] more suicide than ever before and more
[1:25:40] broken homes and more broke than they've
[1:25:43] ever been more divorced than there's
[1:25:44] ever been more insanity addicted to
[1:25:47] pills addicted to alcohol addicted to
[1:25:50] pornography addicted to drugs the world
[1:25:52] is groping in darkness but God has a
[1:25:56] standard to the Word of God God has a
[1:25:59] standard and God said in the evening
[1:26:02] time there shall be light so arise shine
[1:26:04] my light has come turn to numbers
[1:26:08] chapter one I just want to change change
[1:26:10] course here just for a moment and just
[1:26:14] loo just look at something here for a
[1:26:15] moment so turn to numbers chapter 1 and
[1:26:17] verse 50 I want you to look at this this
[1:26:19] here in numbers notice in numbers
[1:26:22] chapter 1 and verse 50 I'll give you
[1:26:25] just a moment to turn there look at just
[1:26:27] how long we've been going
[1:26:28] here he says but thou shall appoint this
[1:26:32] is numbers one verse 50 but thou shall
[1:26:34] appoint the Levites over the tabernacle
[1:26:37] no notice Israel here as he would as he
[1:26:39] would as God would call him notice this
[1:26:42] in numbers chapter 1 and verse 50 but
[1:26:44] thou shall appoint the Levites over the
[1:26:47] tabernacle of testimony and over all the
[1:26:49] vessels thereof and over all the things
[1:26:51] that belong to it they shall bear the
[1:26:53] tabernacle and all the vessels thereof
[1:26:55] and they shall minister unto it and
[1:26:56] shall notice this and shall in camp
[1:26:59] round
[1:27:04] it was it was the the the physical
[1:27:07] manifestation a physical representation
[1:27:09] of the tabernacle or the house of God in
[1:27:13] heaven remember Moses God says Moses
[1:27:15] builded exactly as I showed you to them
[1:27:16] according to the pattern in heaven so
[1:27:18] Israel's tabernacle would be a
[1:27:21] representative of truth it would be a
[1:27:24] way of salvation they're the only ones
[1:27:27] who were saved there were the only ones
[1:27:29] if you wanted to get to God you had to
[1:27:31] come through Israel you follow me
[1:27:34] they were the ambassadors of truth and
[1:27:36] so so they would they would camp Oregon
[1:27:40] says you would camp round about the
[1:27:42] tabernacle and notice it he says and
[1:27:45] when the tabernacle set it forward the
[1:27:48] Levites shall take it down and when the
[1:27:50] tabernacle is to be pitched the Levites
[1:27:52] shall set it up and and the stranger
[1:27:54] that cometh nice shallow depth and the
[1:27:57] Chittenden is or shall pitch their tents
[1:27:59] notice this in verse 52 every man by his
[1:28:03] own camp and every man by his own
[1:28:08] standard throughout their host numbers
[1:28:12] chapter 2 1 just turn straight over
[1:28:14] there and look at verse 2 every man of
[1:28:17] the children of Israel shall pitch by
[1:28:19] his own standard with the in sign of
[1:28:24] their father's house far off about the
[1:28:29] tabernacle of the congregation shall
[1:28:32] they pitch so notice that series a says
[1:28:35] every man you're gonna camp according to
[1:28:37] your to your father's house
[1:28:39] by your own standard according to the in
[1:28:41] sign of your father's house far off
[1:28:44] about the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:28:45] shall they pitch so there was a
[1:28:48] different assigned standard to each
[1:28:51] tribe of Israel
[1:28:53] you remember Ezekiel's vision that
[1:28:56] Ezekiel has the vision of the Beast and
[1:28:58] he has the vision of the ox and and the
[1:29:01] vision of the man I want you to look at
[1:29:03] this here and brother Jordan can you
[1:29:04] just give me a confirmation are we able
[1:29:06] to show the PowerPoint because if for
[1:29:08] not I'm just going to go past showing
[1:29:10] these images but I want to I want to get
[1:29:12] to this here just for a moment so notice
[1:29:16] it was a different assignees
[1:29:17] has this vision it was the next
[1:29:20] PowerPoint than brother Jordan the
[1:29:21] second one that I sent you uh and it's
[1:29:23] the same thing I think it's revelations
[1:29:25] chapter 4 where it speaks of the
[1:29:27] anointings
[1:29:28] the anointing of the man of the ox of
[1:29:31] the Eagle notice all of these standards
[1:29:34] these were the in signs these were the
[1:29:37] in signs these were the standards that
[1:29:41] God established notice this here in
[1:29:43] revelations chapter 4 you can pick it up
[1:29:46] the the beasts that surrounded the
[1:29:47] throne remember that the scripture there
[1:29:50] the Beast the the different face the
[1:29:53] face of the man the face of the eagle
[1:29:55] the face of the ox notice let me just
[1:29:58] pull it up here in my on the face of the
[1:30:00] lion and so these were different
[1:30:02] standards notice this here show the
[1:30:05] PowerPoint if you could you had the lion
[1:30:07] standard and we know that there was a
[1:30:09] lion age they were anointed under all
[1:30:12] those horse riders brother Branham said
[1:30:14] what God would do he sent us he would he
[1:30:16] said Satan would send out a spirit in
[1:30:17] that first age and he said that spirit
[1:30:20] of that black horse ride of that red
[1:30:22] horse rider and that white horse rider
[1:30:24] that pale horse rider that was a
[1:30:25] combination of all of them and he said
[1:30:28] it he said but every time Satan would go
[1:30:30] to send his spirit to attack the first
[1:30:31] age he said God would set his spirit of
[1:30:34] a lion and he said and it was it would
[1:30:37] meet the challenge of that day and he
[1:30:39] said then in the next stage there was
[1:30:41] the spirit that went forth all rider
[1:30:43] that went forth and he says God would
[1:30:45] send the spirit of man and he said that
[1:30:47] was the age of man the intellect the
[1:30:49] great minds of man that they would they
[1:30:52] would take the word that was taken out
[1:30:54] by the Catholic Church the Bible was
[1:30:56] taken out of their own language but God
[1:30:58] would use me and he Dre had raised men
[1:31:00] up like Wycliffe and and and and Finney
[1:31:02] and different men that would that would
[1:31:04] that would take the Word of God and put
[1:31:05] the word back using the intellect the
[1:31:08] anointing of man of the mind of man and
[1:31:10] they would give the word back to the
[1:31:12] believer
[1:31:13] you know the edge of the Ox where it was
[1:31:14] an ox of burden where he get literally
[1:31:17] gave his life we're going into this but
[1:31:18] then in the end time there would be a
[1:31:20] pale horse rider and that pale horse
[1:31:22] rider would be a conglomeration of all
[1:31:24] of the other beasts all of the other
[1:31:27] horse riders it was pal it was a mixture
[1:31:31] said I'm gonna send the anointing of a
[1:31:33] flying eagle it was a standard let me
[1:31:36] say this my brother my sister that
[1:31:37] standard that you're under today is not
[1:31:40] the age of an ox where you got to give
[1:31:41] your life as a martyr it's not the age
[1:31:43] of a man where you got to use your
[1:31:45] intellect to figure things out but
[1:31:47] you've been given the spirit the
[1:31:49] anointing of a flying eagle to rise
[1:31:52] above it by revelation you can see
[1:31:54] clearly you can see the past what
[1:31:57] happened in the church ages and what
[1:31:59] happened down through history you can
[1:32:00] see the future
[1:32:03] see the present because you're an eagle
[1:32:05] that's your anointing and notice here
[1:32:08] was the same same thing that they'd seen
[1:32:11] that Ezekiel sees is the same thing in
[1:32:14] the book of Revelation we don't have
[1:32:15] time to get to to all of this today so I
[1:32:18] just want to just to get to this as best
[1:32:20] as I can and then we're just gonna have
[1:32:22] to move on but I want you to notice this
[1:32:24] here let me just find my place here just
[1:32:27] for a moment in the fifth seal brother
[1:32:30] Branham says now the scripture says when
[1:32:32] the enemy comes rushing in like a flood
[1:32:34] the Spirit of God is listening close
[1:32:37] hold that power point here for a moment
[1:32:39] notice this now the scripture says when
[1:32:41] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:32:43] Spirit of God raises a standard against
[1:32:45] that this is the fifth seal in 63 and so
[1:32:48] when the enemy went out as an antichrist
[1:32:50] God sent a certain type of power out to
[1:32:53] meet him and when they he went out again
[1:32:57] as a red horse rider another color
[1:32:59] another power another ministry God sent
[1:33:02] went after him to combat it to hold his
[1:33:05] church sent the third one again God sent
[1:33:09] his third beast common announced it we
[1:33:11] just looked at those in the PowerPoint
[1:33:13] there he sent the fourth one God say his
[1:33:15] fourth one when the Antichrist in and
[1:33:17] the church ages ended - at that time
[1:33:19] watch oh this is really good now we see
[1:33:21] the devil's changing four beasts meant
[1:33:25] what power they was revealed to or what
[1:33:27] power he revealed to the world
[1:33:29] and how they ended it on this place the
[1:33:31] death horse now look at God's powers of
[1:33:34] these beasts to combat them the first
[1:33:37] beast of God he went out to meet the
[1:33:40] Antichrist with the Antichrist spirit
[1:33:43] when it's with he says he says when it's
[1:33:46] in just his teaching now remember when
[1:33:48] the Antichrist first rode he was in a
[1:33:51] teaching ministry the Antichrist rode
[1:33:53] first in a teaching ministry now watch
[1:33:55] the one that went out to meet him the
[1:33:59] lion the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:34:02] which is the word what did they have in
[1:34:05] the first page they had the word when
[1:34:07] his false teaching went forth the true
[1:34:10] word went out to meet him
[1:34:12] notice this now I want you to notice
[1:34:15] Israel here
[1:34:17] because and just here brother Jordan if
[1:34:19] you want to go to the PowerPoint if you
[1:34:20] want to go to the tabernacle picture the
[1:34:22] slide right after the Eagle notice this
[1:34:26] was this a good picture a good
[1:34:27] illustration of that Old Testament
[1:34:29] wilderness Tabernacle you have here you
[1:34:32] have the outer Court you have the you
[1:34:34] have the tabernacle and you have the
[1:34:36] holy a fire of God the pillar fire
[1:34:38] coming out and of that of that holiest
[1:34:41] of Holies and notice all of the tents
[1:34:44] that are all surrounding all of the
[1:34:47] tabernacle is each camp now notice this
[1:34:51] here in your Bible and I want you to
[1:34:53] follow alone closely here notice what
[1:34:56] what we read here that every man and
[1:34:59] numbers 2 he says every man shall camp
[1:35:01] according to his standard every man
[1:35:05] according to the in sign of his father's
[1:35:07] house so each tribe
[1:35:10] notice this Judah the tribe of Judah you
[1:35:16] know what their flag was the standard
[1:35:18] that flag bear the one that held the
[1:35:19] flag the big flat and the in sign that
[1:35:22] would go out it was it was it was the
[1:35:24] camp of the lion and you had you had
[1:35:27] Judah who was under the lion standard
[1:35:29] you had a sacar and you had Zebulon who
[1:35:34] would camp under that lion anointing
[1:35:37] they would camp under the the tribe of
[1:35:40] Judah Issachar Zebulun came in behind
[1:35:44] Judah they camped right behind him but
[1:35:46] they were under the same standard of a
[1:35:48] lion Reuben would have the standard of a
[1:35:52] man has inside his flag as camp would
[1:35:55] look like would have the face of a man
[1:35:56] and it was it was under under Reuben was
[1:35:59] the man standard Simeon and Levi
[1:36:02] I'm sorry Simeon and GAD would follow in
[1:36:05] behind Reuben and and they ordered
[1:36:08] themselves half under the same standard
[1:36:12] of a man under the same ensign Levi was
[1:36:15] them - Levi was that was the ministry he
[1:36:18] was the priesthood and you know where
[1:36:20] Levi dwelled in the tabernacle he was in
[1:36:23] the middle of all the other tribes he
[1:36:26] was the standard he was he was in the
[1:36:28] middle of the movement
[1:36:30] you had a for him and Ephraim had the
[1:36:32] standard of the in sign of the ox and
[1:36:35] and and and Manasseh and Benjamin
[1:36:39] followed encamped right under that
[1:36:41] anointing or that ensign of Ephraim
[1:36:44] which was an ox standard then you had
[1:36:46] Dan and the tribe of Dan had the Eagle
[1:36:49] anointing and the Eagle standard Asher
[1:36:52] nepto lie would follow a camp under that
[1:36:55] Eagle standard and notice brother
[1:36:57] Branham says this in the kid revelations
[1:36:59] chapter through Chapter three picks this
[1:37:00] up
[1:37:04] listen here Dan was an eagle Ruben was
[1:37:08] the man's face ephraim is an ox now you
[1:37:10] get the picture there's the way they
[1:37:12] camped in the Bible now if you'll notice
[1:37:15] Dan is the head of these tribes of three
[1:37:18] tribes Judah is the head of three tribes
[1:37:21] Ruben's the head of three tribes he
[1:37:22] frames a head of three tribes three
[1:37:24] fours is twelve 12 tribes of Israel see
[1:37:27] each one with their banner and the
[1:37:31] banner of Judah the banner of Reuben man
[1:37:34] the banner of Ephraim an ox the banner
[1:37:37] of Dan was an eagle now look back here
[1:37:41] what John said and one this is in
[1:37:44] Revelations brother banners pointing to
[1:37:45] one had the face now let's read it here
[1:37:47] now just see if it isn't the same thing
[1:37:49] like it was in heaven the first beast
[1:37:52] was like a lion Judah the second beast
[1:37:54] was like a calf that's a young ox the
[1:37:56] third beast was the face of a man the
[1:37:58] force fourth beast was a flying eagle
[1:38:00] just exactly the tribes of Israel camped
[1:38:03] guarding
[1:38:05] what were they guarding what was the
[1:38:07] purpose of this they were Guardians Oh
[1:38:10] hallelujah hope you catch it today the
[1:38:13] the tabernacle was the way it was the
[1:38:15] standard it was the way to life and
[1:38:18] Jesus said I am the way they were a pre
[1:38:21] figure of the way that Jesus spoke up
[1:38:23] and all of those anointings under the
[1:38:26] under Israel when they marched to battle
[1:38:28] when they marched through the wilderness
[1:38:31] when they marched they didn't just
[1:38:32] scatter everyone you were ever here and
[1:38:34] wherever you want to be over here they
[1:38:35] marched according to their standard and
[1:38:37] wherever they went they marched with the
[1:38:40] with Ruben and ganon and and Dan was the
[1:38:42] eagle and they stayed in order why they
[1:38:45] were Guardians they were in anointing
[1:38:47] they were under the anointing they were
[1:38:49] guarding the way to life why do you have
[1:38:54] trouble boy we could get really in the
[1:38:56] weeds here today just getting into so
[1:38:58] much but why do you why do you have a
[1:39:00] cherubims at the Garden of Eden when man
[1:39:03] was kicked out of the Garden of Eden and
[1:39:05] the Bible says cherubim with flaming
[1:39:07] swords were to protect the way back to
[1:39:10] Eden that's what the Bible says he says
[1:39:12] and he put cherubims with flaming swords
[1:39:14] to protect our guard the way men
[1:39:17] was put out on in a curse oh but my
[1:39:21] brother my sister we're going back to
[1:39:23] eat in one day or being restored - and
[1:39:26] this is Satan's Eden this is Satan's
[1:39:28] Kingdom this is Satan's world this is he
[1:39:30] can have it I don't want it he can have
[1:39:32] the world system today I'm going back to
[1:39:35] Eden I've received the word for my day
[1:39:37] and the message of the hour and it's
[1:39:39] anointed me with the flying eagle to fly
[1:39:41] above all of the chaos and pandemonium
[1:39:43] and panic that's in the world today I'm
[1:39:46] not part of this world system I'm part
[1:39:49] of another world can you hope you're
[1:39:50] saying Amen here today I'm part of
[1:39:53] another dimension I'm part of a hold of
[1:39:55] a system I'm not of this world system
[1:39:58] but Israel was guarding the way back you
[1:40:02] have cherubims and Eden then you go to
[1:40:04] the tabernacle and notice in the mercy
[1:40:06] seat in the holiest of holies the Bible
[1:40:08] says that God said put to cherubims
[1:40:10] guarding the mercy seat oh it was the
[1:40:13] entrance back
[1:40:14] it was speaking of Christ it was
[1:40:16] speaking of I am the way I am the truth
[1:40:19] there's there is a way that seemeth
[1:40:21] right in the middle there's a broad way
[1:40:22] but the end there of his destruction but
[1:40:25] then there's a narrow way and Jesus says
[1:40:27] in few there be that find it but I'm
[1:40:30] glad I found it today I'm glad I found
[1:40:32] that way back to Eden notice they were
[1:40:35] they were all guarding this is how they
[1:40:37] marched they marched under the standard
[1:40:40] listen to what prophet says he says the
[1:40:43] first speech dooda was a lion second
[1:40:45] meesa calf that's a young ox third beast
[1:40:47] was the face of a man the fourth beast
[1:40:49] was a flying eagle just exactly like
[1:40:51] Israel camped around guarding their
[1:40:55] earth they are earthly guards of the
[1:40:58] right to the ark they were guarding the
[1:41:02] access to life they were guarding the
[1:41:06] revelation of the Word of God
[1:41:08] that's why Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:41:09] were under an ox a lion an ox a man in
[1:41:13] an eagle anointing and brother branham
[1:41:14] said what were those Gospels the four
[1:41:16] Gospels was the guardians of Revelation
[1:41:19] they were guarding the way that's why
[1:41:21] Matthew 28:19 is in there is in the book
[1:41:24] of Matthew what is Matthew 28:19 go ye
[1:41:26] therefore into all the world preach unto
[1:41:28] them baptizing them in the name of the
[1:41:30] Father and then
[1:41:31] of the Sun and the name of the holy
[1:41:32] ghost you know that why why that's in
[1:41:34] Matthew because Matthew was a guardian
[1:41:35] to the way of life so there would be an
[1:41:38] intentionally there would be a scripture
[1:41:40] in Matthew 28:19 that would confound the
[1:41:43] wise and the prudent the entire church
[1:41:46] world today is serving under a
[1:41:47] Trinitarian baptism under Trinitarian
[1:41:50] understanding of three persons and of
[1:41:52] God and it's it's a demonic spirit
[1:41:54] that's a uniting spirit that unites all
[1:41:57] the denominations you go to end in a
[1:41:58] nomination of church today and you go to
[1:42:00] their website click on the statement of
[1:42:01] faith every single one of them and you
[1:42:05] we believe in the father I think the
[1:42:08] eternal God eternally manifested himself
[1:42:10] in three persons the father the son the
[1:42:13] spirit
[1:42:13] oh that they're united
[1:42:18] hands with each other on anything else
[1:42:20] but this one doctrine unites film and
[1:42:22] they use Matthew 28:19 to prove it go ye
[1:42:25] therefore baptizing them in the name of
[1:42:27] the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:42:29] Holy Ghost but Jesus has behold I lay a
[1:42:32] stone and he says it'll be it'll be a
[1:42:35] stone of offense a stumbling stone it
[1:42:38] will stumble the wise and prudent but
[1:42:40] the simple shall find it
[1:42:42] glory to God it stumbles that scripture
[1:42:47] their labor of the access to the way of
[1:42:50] life and they they try to open the door
[1:42:52] and they can't get in and they come away
[1:42:54] with three gods three persons because
[1:42:57] they don't have revelation because
[1:42:58] Matthew was a guard who was under a lion
[1:43:00] anointing to guard the way to life all
[1:43:03] friends though the my brother my sister
[1:43:05] the word is so beautiful it's so perfect
[1:43:08] they were under those anointings John
[1:43:11] was that eagle notice this it's a it's
[1:43:13] an anointed it's a revelation Matthew
[1:43:15] Mark Luke and John guard the way to the
[1:43:18] book of Acts and unless you have the
[1:43:22] revelation to get past the key go will
[1:43:24] you safer than that what does that mean
[1:43:25] then baptize them in the name of the
[1:43:27] Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:43:30] in the name of then what is the name of
[1:43:32] the Father the Lord what is the name of
[1:43:35] the son Jesus what is the name of the
[1:43:37] Spirit Christ baptize them in the name
[1:43:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ father son
[1:43:42] spirit not three persons one it what not
[1:43:46] not eternally manifested in three
[1:43:48] different presences as they as the
[1:43:50] Trinitarian doctrine States manifested
[1:43:52] in three essences you can have what you
[1:43:56] can't have a person a personality and
[1:43:58] not have a person whole but my brother
[1:44:01] my sister do you see this this was this
[1:44:03] was guards just like Israel they guarded
[1:44:06] according to their standard they marched
[1:44:08] according to their standard they were
[1:44:10] under that anointing oh it was it was an
[1:44:14] it was an anointing that came - and then
[1:44:16] you have the church ages and you have
[1:44:18] the lion you have the ox
[1:44:20] or the man you have the ox you have the
[1:44:22] Eagle anointing under each one of those
[1:44:24] ages and Israel was God was marching
[1:44:28] according to their standard all under
[1:44:30] their anointing they
[1:44:31] regarding the way of life I want you to
[1:44:33] look at this in the PowerPoint where the
[1:44:34] Jordan go to the next one I hope this
[1:44:36] comes through clear this is how Israel
[1:44:39] marched look at the tabernacle there the
[1:44:41] yellow block in the middle that was the
[1:44:43] tabernacle and then to the west you had
[1:44:45] ephraim then to the south you had a
[1:44:47] reuben then to the east you had the lion
[1:44:49] then to the north you had the eagle
[1:44:51] under Dan and notice here the Levites
[1:44:54] the ministry access to the word came
[1:44:57] through the Levites in the tabernacle
[1:44:59] and this is look at the picture of how
[1:45:01] they marched this is how they marched
[1:45:03] and notice as the artist drew it it's in
[1:45:06] the picture or the portrait of the shape
[1:45:09] of a cross you think that's an accident
[1:45:13] my brother my sister it's not an
[1:45:14] accident they were marching what was it
[1:45:17] whenever if you were to take an aerial
[1:45:19] view of the children of Israel as they
[1:45:21] marched through the wilderness they were
[1:45:22] marching and then the shape of a cross
[1:45:25] it was all speaking of something it was
[1:45:27] all speaking of Christ the word
[1:45:29] revelation of the word of God oh my
[1:45:32] brother and my sister today I hope you
[1:45:33] catch it today this is how God noticed
[1:45:36] the next slide this is an aerial view
[1:45:38] here this is an aerial view of the
[1:45:40] tabernacle of how they marched they
[1:45:42] marched they didn't know it but they
[1:45:44] were under an anointing they didn't even
[1:45:47] know what they were doing but they were
[1:45:49] under an anointing of the Word of God
[1:45:50] they were part of the purpose of God
[1:45:52] they were part of the plan of God they
[1:45:55] were March and according to the word
[1:45:57] they were they were they were the
[1:45:59] standard the ambassadors of Jehovah God
[1:46:03] oh how wonderful notice what brother
[1:46:06] Branham says here he says that's the
[1:46:08] reason in the fifth seal that's the
[1:46:11] reason we had a rainiest Polycarp and
[1:46:14] those fellows a Saint Martin when that
[1:46:16] Antichrist was riding with this false
[1:46:18] teaching God sent a teaching the word
[1:46:21] the Lion of the tribe of Judah which is
[1:46:23] the word made manifest by the Holy
[1:46:25] Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to
[1:46:27] manifest himself which is the word
[1:46:29] that's the reason the early church had
[1:46:31] healings and miracles and visions and
[1:46:32] power it's because they were Living Word
[1:46:35] they were they was he says because it
[1:46:37] was the Living Word in the form of the
[1:46:39] lion the tribe of Judah riding out to
[1:46:41] combat that now you got it brother
[1:46:43] Branham says
[1:46:44] he sends his power Antichrist and God
[1:46:47] sends his the word Antichrist false
[1:46:50] teaching the true teaching went forth to
[1:46:52] combat it now that was the first one now
[1:46:55] that was the first Church apostolic that
[1:46:57] went to meet him
[1:46:58] another thing the Ox is also a beast of
[1:47:01] sacrifice see they give their lives just
[1:47:05] as freely as they could give them in the
[1:47:06] Dark Ages a thousand years their
[1:47:08] Catholicism controlled the world and
[1:47:11] they just went right in yes or no they
[1:47:13] didn't my
[1:47:19] me how why the very spirit of that age
[1:47:22] they didn't mind given their life they
[1:47:24] didn't mind sacrificing becoming a
[1:47:26] martyr he said by the mat I could not
[1:47:28] imagine again today I just I just think
[1:47:31] of I hear about those those Christians
[1:47:34] who stood there in the Roman Coliseum
[1:47:36] Zand they were fed to lions the Bible
[1:47:38] speaks and says oh they were sewn
[1:47:40] asunder of whom the world is not worthy
[1:47:42] they were torn apart by wild beasts wild
[1:47:45] animals do you think of those Christians
[1:47:46] through those dark ages save their life
[1:47:48] you know sealed their testimony by their
[1:47:50] own blood and you say here today in 2020
[1:47:53] boy I just can't imagine I can't how
[1:47:55] could they do that brother and sister
[1:47:57] what you need to understand is they
[1:47:59] couldn't do that but there was an
[1:48:01] anointing that was released to them it
[1:48:04] was an anointing that came over them
[1:48:06] they couldn't have done it himself but
[1:48:09] they were being controlled by prophecy
[1:48:12] by a word that was released the ox they
[1:48:17] went and died brother venom said why
[1:48:18] they didn't mind he said that they
[1:48:20] didn't mind that they would just give
[1:48:22] their life he said oh he says Polycarp
[1:48:24] was faced with lions he was burned you
[1:48:27] know what it was too late for them to
[1:48:28] turn a lion a lion loose in the reader
[1:48:30] so they so they tore down a bathroom an
[1:48:33] old bathhouse there and put him in the
[1:48:35] arena and burned him down and on his
[1:48:37] road coming down this is Polycarp and on
[1:48:39] his road coming down when he was on his
[1:48:41] way to be killed he was walking with his
[1:48:43] head down the Roman centurion said
[1:48:45] you're an old man well respected why
[1:48:47] don't you just announce this whole thing
[1:48:49] he just kept looking towards heaven and
[1:48:51] a voice spoke from somewhere they
[1:48:53] couldn't understand where said Polycarp
[1:48:55] don't fear I'm with you oh why he was
[1:48:59] standing for the word of God and when
[1:49:01] they begin to power the boards on him to
[1:49:03] burning there was a heavenly music that
[1:49:05] came down and the anthems from some
[1:49:08] angelic somewhere sang the songs he
[1:49:10] never even one time batted an eye to the
[1:49:12] skull fur that's gallant men that's men
[1:49:15] who can stand the martyrs down through
[1:49:18] the ages there suffered terribly why
[1:49:20] they were under the inspiration the
[1:49:24] Spirit of God the power of God oh my
[1:49:28] mother brother Adam says don't you ever
[1:49:30] forget this my brethren you own tape I
[1:49:32] want you to examine this
[1:49:33] how could men do anything else besides
[1:49:37] the power of God that it had been
[1:49:39] released to them I could have never done
[1:49:42] that
[1:49:42] Polycarp could have never done that but
[1:49:45] he had an anointing upon his life he
[1:49:48] says oh he says he says he says how
[1:49:50] could he ever do that he says how could
[1:49:52] they ever have done that I'm gonna set
[1:49:54] this box up here to represent that if
[1:49:55] God sends a certain spirit among them
[1:49:57] that's the only thing that they can work
[1:50:00] by how did they give their life I
[1:50:03] couldn't imagine doing that brother Matt
[1:50:04] that's because that's not your anointing
[1:50:05] that's not sure in 19 brother Branham
[1:50:08] said the bride doesn't go through
[1:50:09] persecution she doesn't go through
[1:50:11] martyrdom he says in the fifth seal he
[1:50:13] says my people that I seen beyond the
[1:50:15] curtain of time they weren't under the
[1:50:16] martyrs block he says they were brother
[1:50:19] Branham he's asking questions answers
[1:50:21] 1964 with the joy the bride goes through
[1:50:23] the tribulation will she be he says will
[1:50:24] the bride go through persecution brother
[1:50:26] Branham says no the next thing for her
[1:50:28] is the rapture why our anointing is that
[1:50:30] the anointing of an ox it's not the
[1:50:32] anointing of a man that's why we don't
[1:50:34] need intellect to figure this thing out
[1:50:36] that's not our anointing people are
[1:50:38] trying to become an election with the
[1:50:40] message and become a bunch of intellects
[1:50:41] and and and and see uh theologians of
[1:50:44] the message that's good thing to
[1:50:45] understand the message but my brother
[1:50:47] you better realize that's not sure
[1:50:48] anointing that's not an anointing to get
[1:50:50] you out of here but you've received an
[1:50:52] anointing of a flying Mighty Eagle that
[1:50:55] a rapture the church one day hallelujah
[1:50:58] he says that's the spirit that they were
[1:51:00] under that was the standard that they
[1:51:04] were under some Ernie you're gonna have
[1:51:07] to suffer to death Pergamon soul he says
[1:51:10] I have a few things against you
[1:51:11] because that was and then thou has led
[1:51:13] them there to hold the doctrine of
[1:51:14] Balaam and so Thyatira you notice all of
[1:51:17] these different ages brother Branham
[1:51:19] says in Revelation chapter four boy the
[1:51:21] South gates guarded by the ox the North
[1:51:23] gates guarded by the lion I mean the
[1:51:25] east gate the north gate is guarded by
[1:51:27] the flying eagle John the Evangelist
[1:51:30] then the physician on this side Luke the
[1:51:32] man he starts to show you John the
[1:51:34] Evangelist the physician Luke the man
[1:51:36] you had the ox the eagle the lion all of
[1:51:39] those anointings they were there too
[1:51:41] TEKT the way back to the Tree of Life
[1:51:45] they were there to protect that way it
[1:51:49] was an anointing my brother let me
[1:51:51] preach to you today you're under the
[1:51:53] anointing of oh you said I don't see how
[1:51:55] I'm ever gonna be perfect I don't see
[1:51:57] how I'm ever gonna be anything brother
[1:51:58] Matt I don't see how I'm gonna be in
[1:51:59] that bride I don't see how I'm gonna my
[1:52:01] body's gonna change I got so many faults
[1:52:03] and so many men fell so many mistakes I
[1:52:05] just can't imagine ever be imperfect oh
[1:52:07] but there's an anointing that's released
[1:52:08] unto you if you come under the anointing
[1:52:10] of this word of God it'll free you from
[1:52:12] fear it'll free you from panic
[1:52:19] from pandemonium that the world's your
[1:52:22] closed in the world shutout it's an
[1:52:25] eagle anointing the spirit of a flying
[1:52:27] eagle to rise above it when the Spirit
[1:52:31] of God comes in like a flood he says
[1:52:34] that when the when the enemy comes in
[1:52:36] like a flood the Spirit of God raises up
[1:52:39] a standard against him it was a standard
[1:52:44] against him and then we're at 2:40 12 1
[1:52:48] could be 1140 there just give me just a
[1:52:51] few more minutes but the Jordan if you
[1:52:52] could give me just a clock to let me
[1:52:53] know how long I've been he would he
[1:52:56] would give them a standard notice what
[1:52:59] the standard was it was a standard of
[1:53:02] uniformity it was uniformity said it
[1:53:05] would be an ensign it would be the
[1:53:07] standard of the Word of God and my
[1:53:09] brother when the world is losing their
[1:53:11] standard let's raise up our standard
[1:53:13] that we've received in this day it's not
[1:53:14] a time to let the standards go it's a
[1:53:16] time to raise up the standard in our
[1:53:19] lives even the Roman Empire one of the
[1:53:23] most successful armies that ever walked
[1:53:25] the earth was the Roman army they
[1:53:27] conquered the entire known world you go
[1:53:29] back in history and look at the success
[1:53:32] of the Romans but I read a history
[1:53:34] document it said what was the key to the
[1:53:36] Roman success how were they so
[1:53:38] successful and it said I named
[1:53:40] everything the reasons why they were
[1:53:42] successful when they said one of the
[1:53:44] most important reasons of their success
[1:53:46] what they could tie their success to was
[1:53:48] their uniformity the Centurions all wore
[1:53:54] the same uniform they all dress the same
[1:53:57] you could see them from a distance and
[1:53:59] know it was a Roman soldier because they
[1:54:01] look different than everybody else their
[1:54:04] breastplate there that they were that
[1:54:05] they had their swords they all looked
[1:54:07] the same they all spoke the same
[1:54:09] language they spoke the same language
[1:54:12] they all understood that they were part
[1:54:15] of something bigger than themselves they
[1:54:17] fought for Caesar they carried a flag
[1:54:20] they which was a standard it showed what
[1:54:23] slits Legion they belong to each
[1:54:26] Centurion IH each century had a
[1:54:30] detachment of a hundred men
[1:54:32] in each Legion are at each century and
[1:54:36] an every detachment had a different
[1:54:38] Cygnet to show which part of the army
[1:54:40] they were they were in what was the
[1:54:43] standard notice this what was the
[1:54:45] standard for why did they have it why
[1:54:47] was that bois was that signet raised to
[1:54:50] bring each man in to their position to
[1:54:53] position Aleppo what does the Eagle
[1:54:55] anointing do the Eagle standard was to
[1:54:57] bring us to our position to recognize
[1:55:00] our day in its message to recognize our
[1:55:03] place in our calling to make sure you're
[1:55:06] in the right army the right company they
[1:55:10] had communication there were no cell
[1:55:13] phones in those days you know they
[1:55:14] couldn't text each other but you know
[1:55:16] what they had they had trumpets and that
[1:55:18] trumpet would blow a certain sound and
[1:55:20] everyone would stand to attention this
[1:55:23] trumpet player had one job to do and he
[1:55:26] was to blow his trumpet to signify
[1:55:29] whether to march or defend or hold the
[1:55:32] line they had to hear a certain sound
[1:55:36] and was the penalty of death to the
[1:55:40] roman trumpet player if he was to blow
[1:55:43] an uncertain sound their life was
[1:55:47] blowing a certain sound they had loyalty
[1:55:49] they carried the image everywhere they
[1:55:52] went they carried the image of Caesar
[1:55:54] what was it to do to constantly remind
[1:55:58] the troops that constantly in the heat
[1:56:01] of battle
[1:56:01] when the battle got hot in the and it
[1:56:03] was really hard to fight they can't kept
[1:56:06] that image to me constantly remind the
[1:56:08] troops you're not fighting for yourself
[1:56:09] you're fighting for your king you're
[1:56:12] fighting for your country you're
[1:56:13] fighting for a cause oh my brother my
[1:56:16] sister why would brother branham
[1:56:18] constantly lift up the name of Jesus
[1:56:20] he was constantly he wasn't lifting up
[1:56:23] his own name his trumpet was not blowing
[1:56:25] the name of William Branham it was
[1:56:27] lifting the name of Jesus because Jesus
[1:56:29] said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men
[1:56:31] unto me
[1:56:32] he was constantly reminding the people
[1:56:35] he was constantly lifting the name of
[1:56:37] Jesus to call us to attention but
[1:56:41] history tells us the Roman Empire
[1:56:42] eventually faded off and failing and
[1:56:46] entire empire completely collapsed and
[1:56:48] came to nothing and and and and
[1:56:50] historians have written article after
[1:56:52] article and to say the reason why did
[1:56:55] that if they could pinpoint why the
[1:56:56] Romans aren't be completely fell apart
[1:57:00] you know what they said that that the
[1:57:02] reason why the Romans started to decline
[1:57:04] is because eventually the Roman Empire
[1:57:07] changed their qualifications for
[1:57:11] membership you see before to be
[1:57:18] Rowman in the army you had to be a born
[1:57:21] citizen it would be born as a Roman in
[1:57:26] order to be in the Army you had to be a
[1:57:28] born Roman I hope you catch the
[1:57:30] significance there even Paul you notice
[1:57:33] Paul in acts 25 when Paul standing
[1:57:35] before Festus Paul claims his rights as
[1:57:38] a Roman citizen because it was important
[1:57:41] to be a Roman citizen not just to be an
[1:57:44] alien a foreigner but a born citizenship
[1:57:48] of Paul cause he was born a Roman but
[1:57:50] they s'what happened to the Roman
[1:57:51] Empire's they started to allow
[1:57:53] mercenaries are paid mercenaries or
[1:57:56] bounty hunters to join the army they
[1:57:58] allowed anybody a alien they allowed a
[1:58:01] aliens to come in foreigners to come in
[1:58:04] and they change they started to allow
[1:58:06] membership to outsiders you know what
[1:58:08] happened when they allowed outsiders
[1:58:10] uniformity was lost was it so important
[1:58:13] anymore they didn't bleed the Roman
[1:58:15] blood they didn't but they they're they
[1:58:17] were they were fighting the Roman army
[1:58:19] but there was no loyalty there to the
[1:58:20] king uh they they come in and then what
[1:58:25] happens is discipline was dropped you
[1:58:27] know why they weren't because to favor
[1:58:29] larger armies they wanted larger armies
[1:58:31] so they open it up to everybody and then
[1:58:33] communication broke down because they
[1:58:35] didn't all speak the Roman tongue they
[1:58:38] didn't all speak the same language
[1:58:40] somewhere or some foreigners didn't
[1:58:42] speak their language so then commands
[1:58:45] were not understood those who didn't
[1:58:47] speak the language didn't understand
[1:58:48] they didn't have the history there and
[1:58:51] beyond that there was no loyalty these
[1:58:53] mercenaries had no loyalty to Caesar
[1:58:55] they were loyal to themselves as a
[1:58:56] mercenary you see why it's so important
[1:59:00] that we hold the standard of the baptism
[1:59:04] of the Holy Ghost why it's so important
[1:59:08] Jesus is central doctrine when he first
[1:59:11] comes on the scene the man must be born
[1:59:14] again
[1:59:14] it was the standard of the baptism of
[1:59:18] the Holy Ghost there is no other way to
[1:59:22] be part of this family you're not born
[1:59:23] because your daddy your mommy where was
[1:59:26] raised or whoever your relative was was
[1:59:28] a preacher believe the message are they
[1:59:30] knew brother Brandon that's not how you
[1:59:31] get a
[1:59:31] to the army you have to be born into
[1:59:34] this family it's not my paying ties or
[1:59:36] singing in church you have to be born in
[1:59:40] the army even that you notice the Union
[1:59:43] Army in the Civil War that carried a
[1:59:46] flag the flags were carried by by the
[1:59:48] Union Army and the Confederate Army to
[1:59:51] identify which which army you were from
[1:59:53] and one of the most important soldiers
[1:59:56] on the battlefield one of the most
[1:59:58] important jobs was the flag carrier
[2:00:01] he was shot quicker than anybody they'd
[2:00:05] shoot the standard what was it he was
[2:00:07] the standard bearer and they would shoot
[2:00:09] him down more than he'd be he'd fall
[2:00:10] quicker than anybody because the enemy
[2:00:13] knew that if you killed the standard
[2:00:16] bearer oh if you killed those that held
[2:00:19] the standard then there would be mass
[2:00:22] confusion you didn't know what company
[2:00:23] you were smoke was going and cannons
[2:00:26] were flying and shots were being fired
[2:00:27] he had to look up in the middle of that
[2:00:29] you had to see what flag you were under
[2:00:32] am I in the right company am i under the
[2:00:34] right order am i doing the right thing
[2:00:36] and they knew that if they would kill
[2:00:38] the standard-bearer mass confusion would
[2:00:40] flow and Satan knew if he could kill the
[2:00:42] standard math.sin would flow like tidal
[2:00:45] waves mass confusion mass immorality
[2:00:50] what was the purpose of that standard
[2:00:52] barrier so that in the heat of the
[2:00:55] battle the battle got hot when the
[2:00:58] soldiers became shell-shocked didn't
[2:01:01] know where they were at didn't know they
[2:01:02] were in the middle of battle here in
[2:01:04] gunshots they could look up and see the
[2:01:06] flag they could see the cross and
[2:01:09] position themselves oh it stabilized
[2:01:13] them there their panic it stabilized
[2:01:15] their emotions it stabilized their fears
[2:01:18] oh let me say this my brother my sister
[2:01:21] today we need to hold the flag high we
[2:01:24] need to hold don't lower your standard
[2:01:26] but raise up a standard in your homes
[2:01:28] don't let the yeah yeah yeah if all you
[2:01:30] have is just an intellectual
[2:01:32] understanding get into the Word of God
[2:01:34] say God I want to be filled with the
[2:01:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost so that I
[2:01:38] could hold the standard high so that I
[2:01:40] could blow my life can blow a trumpet
[2:01:42] that'll be a certain sound for my
[2:01:44] children a certain
[2:01:45] sound for my family a certain sound to
[2:01:47] the world let me get under this
[2:01:50] anointing of this flying eagle my

[2:05:17] realize here today it's not the opinions
[2:05:20] that I have is not the opinions of the
[2:05:21] world or not looking to experts
[2:05:23] oh don't let us place our our confidence
[2:05:26] in the arm of flesh oh but we choose to
[2:05:29] fear the Lord we choose to fear the name
[2:05:31] of the Lord let us have the confidence
[2:05:34] that you gave us one standard in this
[2:05:36] world today you gave one certain sound
[2:05:38] it's not changed that's never gonna
[2:05:40] change you're gonna judge the world by
[2:05:43] that standard Lord let us make sure

[2:05:48] realize that we're we're ambassadors of
[2:05:50] truth let our life be a testimony to the
[2:05:53] rest of the world god of stability and
[2:05:55] uncertain times I pray God for each one
[2:05:59] of us today Lord may we hear this word
[2:06:00] of God may we say Lord when the enemy
[2:06:03] comes rushing and like a flood in my
[2:06:04] home let me raise up a standard against
[2:06:07] him oh let that standard be the token
[2:06:09] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:06:12] oh Lord I can't emphasize that enough to
[2:06:14] the families here with children Lord
[2:06:17] those listening this token is not a it's
[2:06:19] not a Bible the token is not a doctrine
[2:06:21] it's not a good sermon the tokens not a
[2:06:23] tape the toga is not a prophet the
[2:06:25] tokens not a not any man the tokens not
[2:06:27] a church the token is what your prophet
[2:06:31] said it was it's the baptism
[2:06:34] the Holy Ghost lorded unless we have
[2:06:38] that unless we have that by a true
[2:06:39] Pentecostal experience not an emotion or
[2:06:43] not a sensation Lord but something that
[2:06:46] changes us from the inside of the inside
[2:06:48] that's the token that's the only thing
[2:06:50] that will keep us safe from the death
[2:06:52] angel that's going through the land
[2:06:53] Laura that's not physical death that we
[2:06:56] fear it's not physical death that we
[2:06:57] need to fear it's spiritual death that's
[2:07:00] striking the world
[2:07:01] or everyone's focused on so natural
[2:07:03] death of this Cova night team Lord but
[2:07:06] there's a much it's a much more lethal
[2:07:08] spirit that's flowing through the world
[2:07:11] that spiritual death there is no
[2:07:14] recovery from that that's why you said
[2:07:16] in Matthew
[2:07:18] fear body all the fear Hillman could
[2:07:23] kill both some body and soul and cast it
[2:07:25] into the lake of fire that's the spirit
[2:07:29] we need to fear today Lord let us make
[2:07:31] sure we have that token that's applied
[2:07:33] to our heart to our homes as we raise
[2:07:35] our hands today Lord heads bowed eyes
[2:07:37] closed say Lord let us have that token
[2:07:40] that'll keep us safe Lord from all harm
