[36:06] whom my soul
[36:07] so long had craved
[36:09] but
[36:10] the honest truth was you didn't find him
[36:13] you realized at that point yes that's
[36:16] who thank you god bless you
[36:19] i just i was enjoying myself back there
[36:23] it's just good to be in the house of the
[36:24] lord this morning so
[36:27] let's read that first scripture there
[36:31] it's kind of the
[36:33] john 16 33 i've used it a few times but
[36:39] you know you could read the same
[36:40] scripture every day and it still it
[36:42] still has the authority it still has the
[36:43] power it doesn't change
[36:46] and sometimes you you read something
[36:48] over and over till you finally begin to
[36:50] re it begins to have its effect and
[36:52] things so
[36:53] jesus saying to the he was speaking to
[36:55] the disciples here but it's to all of us
[36:58] these things have i spoken unto you
[37:01] that in me you might have peace
[37:04] in the world you shall have
[37:06] tribulation but be of good cheer
[37:10] i have overcome
[37:12] the world
[37:13] so
[37:14] let's just bow our heads lord we thank
[37:16] you
[37:17] take your word and we read your word
[37:19] lord
[37:21] today we have it in printed form and we
[37:23] can listen to we can
[37:25] turn our phones on and the computer and
[37:29] there's just so many ways to to see your
[37:32] word to read your word to hear your word
[37:34] today lord and
[37:36] back there in the in the old testament
[37:38] the time of the children of israel lord
[37:40] they would gather and someone would read
[37:43] speak to them the words of god and
[37:46] today we have the the
[37:48] the privilege to have it with us all the
[37:50] time lord but
[37:51] not only that but to have the very
[37:54] author the very god of this word the
[37:56] very god made flesh living in us today
[37:58] lord
[37:59] and and not only is just to read and
[38:01] hear the word but the very
[38:03] of the word living in us lord and we
[38:05] appreciate that lord
[38:07] may you bless us now as we speak your
[38:08] word may encourage our hearts lord
[38:11] to everyone that is listening on the
[38:13] hook up lord or maybe streaming today
[38:14] that couldn't be here lord may your
[38:16] presence go to them also lord we ask in
[38:19] jesus christ's name
[38:21] amen you may be seated there
[38:24] just a couple of things too
[38:27] we've reached out to a few brothers
[38:30] recently just to invite them to come on
[38:33] out
[38:34] brother tim cross
[38:36] brother joe adams
[38:39] um brother dwayne lawson
[38:41] and brother nathan erickson these are
[38:43] all brothers who have all told us if you
[38:46] if you'd like to have us come just let
[38:48] us know that
[38:49] we'd be able to arrange something so
[38:51] brother nathan has has committed to
[38:55] uh
[38:56] here in november coming out visiting
[38:58] with us and the other brothers are
[38:59] looking at their schedules
[39:02] and i remember one time asking brother
[39:03] dwayne lawson and he said his schedule
[39:05] is generally six months out his book
[39:07] solid six months so kind of and now
[39:10] brother ray erickson is having him stay
[39:12] home a lot now as brother ray erickson
[39:15] may be stepping down and brother lawson
[39:17] being the pastor of their church
[39:19] but the lord knows all those things so
[39:22] and
[39:24] so we're just
[39:25] looking at some of those things to to
[39:27] continue on
[39:29] what the lord would do for us as as we
[39:31] we go forward so
[39:33] and um
[39:35] we know there was different families
[39:36] that have been affected
[39:38] we also heard yesterday the samarano
[39:40] family sister margaret sister marianne
[39:43] and they said one of her sisters
[39:46] and one of their aunts all tested
[39:47] positive with kobet also
[39:50] but that's nothing to god
[39:52] he's the healer
[39:54] he's already done the work
[39:57] brother branham said many times he says
[39:58] he can't he can't heal you now if you
[40:00] came and asked him him he'll say i've
[40:02] already done that
[40:03] he's asking us to believe
[40:05] and he reminds us in his word these
[40:07] things have i spoken unto you that you
[40:09] might have peace
[40:12] peace is the absence of war
[40:16] but not in the physical
[40:18] because there's always a battle with the
[40:19] flesh there's always a battle with
[40:21] something
[40:23] there's a battle with traffic sometimes
[40:24] there's just all kinds of things that we
[40:26] you know you get aggravated about
[40:29] i don't know too many people just sit in
[40:30] a traffic jam and just enjoy it
[40:33] maybe if you could close your eyes and
[40:35] sleep for a while that would be okay but
[40:37] most of the time you get anxious you go
[40:38] like
[40:39] i'm gonna be late i'm gonna you know
[40:42] and
[40:43] it just it's just who we are sometimes
[40:46] but he says that you might have peace
[40:49] they might have rest there might be a a
[40:52] place where you say you know lord
[40:55] brother jordan sing that song i sing
[40:57] because i'm happy
[40:59] and i'll just giving god praise saying
[41:01] lord i know you've got all things in
[41:03] this old house
[41:05] i remember that song from way back
[41:08] way before brother jordan was born
[41:10] probably
[41:11] his dad and mom used to have a lot of
[41:13] songs playing with the old albums at the
[41:15] house and that's an old song this old
[41:17] house
[41:18] and as a kid you're thinking about a
[41:19] physical house
[41:21] you know but this old house is the one i
[41:23] won't get rid of you know
[41:25] the parts don't always work anymore and
[41:28] replacement parts are very expensive
[41:31] um go to a body shop you know i think
[41:34] that's what they call the hospitals but
[41:37] there's a body prepared for us oh and i
[41:39] appreciate that
[41:41] and then he says but be of good cheer
[41:45] smile
[41:46] there's a hope that lies within you
[41:48] there's something that that makes you
[41:49] get up in the morning and says yes lord
[41:52] i can go through another day for i have
[41:54] overcome the world
[41:56] now these words were spoken by jesus to
[41:59] his disciples
[42:00] before calvary
[42:04] and he's already making that statement i
[42:06] have overcome the world
[42:10] because he says he went back
[42:13] from before the foundation of the world
[42:15] the lamb had been slain
[42:19] so to god it was as good as done
[42:22] and i appreciate that the the gospel of
[42:24] jesus christ
[42:26] is jesus christ the same yesterday today
[42:29] and forever so
[42:31] let's have some
[42:32] just continue on the same line a little
[42:34] bit
[42:35] as we did last sunday brother noel what
[42:38] he has spoke what we heard from brother
[42:39] ferguson on
[42:41] friday night the different ones that
[42:42] spoke the the theme just continues and
[42:46] i said to somebody i don't remember who
[42:48] was i said just isn't it amazing how the
[42:50] theme just goes
[42:51] almost like us brother sat together and
[42:53] said let's plan this for the next six
[42:55] months
[42:56] and as i thought that i go no no no no
[42:59] it's the same one
[43:01] each brother ministering is being
[43:03] inspired by the same one and that's god
[43:06] and we have to have that confidence
[43:08] lord you know if you have us here it's
[43:10] for a reason and the confidence that god
[43:13] is going to speak to us and help us so
[43:16] let's start with saint john 11
[43:21] and we'll read verses 21 to 27.
[43:26] where
[43:27] jesus has come because lazarus had
[43:30] gotten the news that lazarus
[43:32] was sick
[43:34] and then he didn't hurry over
[43:37] he took his time
[43:39] because there was an appointed time
[43:40] there was a set time there was something
[43:42] god is going to do
[43:44] and i just wonder if we knew all those
[43:46] things would we really have faith
[43:50] or would we really trust them say lord
[43:52] is in your hands i can rest
[43:54] because
[43:55] most of us as humans if we know
[43:58] the specific time of day we're generally
[44:00] not getting ready till then
[44:03] but if if you know somebody come over to
[44:05] visit you they say we may be there in
[44:07] the morning we may be there in the
[44:08] evening you're up early you're getting
[44:09] the house clean you're getting
[44:10] everything ready for company
[44:13] but if they say we won't be there till
[44:15] seven you know like some of us you might
[44:17] start at 6 45.
[44:19] that's just our tendencies
[44:22] but jesus knew what he was going to take
[44:24] place
[44:25] so we go here and then and and he's
[44:27] talking now he's come to come to elabs
[44:29] now and
[44:30] martha comes out to meet him and he said
[44:33] and and martha jackson express she has
[44:35] this confidence and said martha until
[44:37] jesus lord if thou had been here
[44:39] my brother had would have not died
[44:42] i know you i know that he would not have
[44:43] died you've been here you would have
[44:44] just healed him he says
[44:46] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[44:49] will ask of god god will give it to thee
[44:52] there's that calm there had to be a
[44:54] reason something that had gone inspired
[44:56] they'd watch that gave them that
[44:57] confidence
[44:58] you know
[45:00] let's go
[45:02] jesus said saith unto her thy brother
[45:05] shall rise again
[45:06] martha knowing the scripture she said
[45:08] martha said unto him i know that he
[45:10] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[45:12] the last day and this is what he want to
[45:14] look at here jesus said unto her i am
[45:18] the resurrection
[45:20] and the and the life he that believeth
[45:22] in me
[45:24] though he were dead yet shall he live
[45:28] 26 and 27
[45:30] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[45:32] shall never die
[45:33] then he looks at her and says believeth
[45:35] now this
[45:37] is it a revelation in your heart has it
[45:39] anchored into your heart
[45:41] it gets personal with it and she saith
[45:43] on him yay lord i believe if thou art
[45:45] the christ the son of god we should come
[45:48] into the world but he says i am
[45:51] the resurrection
[45:54] and i go to this thought just get ahead
[45:56] the resurrection is living in
[45:58] you and he hasn't changed
[46:02] so you could say i am the resurrection
[46:05] amen oh
[46:07] wait a minute because he lives in you
[46:10] for those of us that were there on
[46:12] friday night
[46:14] and brother ferguson
[46:16] was ministering
[46:17] and he got into a portion there reading
[46:20] some things that brother branham said
[46:23] he said when that believer that
[46:25] and speaking then of the the israelites
[46:28] and
[46:28] with the law
[46:30] and taking that sacrifice
[46:32] taking that lamb
[46:34] and presenting it
[46:36] to the priest there for the sacrifice
[46:38] for his own sins
[46:40] and he talked about placing their hands
[46:42] at the head of the lamb while they're
[46:44] taking in that blood understanding
[46:46] realizing that lamb was taking their
[46:49] place
[46:51] i should have been crucified
[46:53] i should have suffered and died but
[46:56] jesus god's son took my place
[46:59] and and to see that he goes
[47:01] and when they placed it and and the lamb
[47:02] took and the blood got all over their
[47:04] hands and all they realized that their
[47:07] sins were now covered
[47:10] but brother brandon gets into it at that
[47:12] same time in looking at what jesus
[47:16] christ did for us
[47:18] we place our hands on him we take it by
[47:20] faith we believe and we accept his
[47:22] forgiveness the blood in us
[47:25] see your sins
[47:27] your iniquity your failures are all
[47:29] transferred to him
[47:31] because it was all put on that lamb
[47:34] that's kind of hard to understand it's
[47:36] not hard to believe sometimes they
[47:37] comprehend but that's what the word of
[47:39] god teaches us
[47:41] and that is it was all transferred to
[47:43] that lamb
[47:45] now in the old testament they didn't
[47:47] their sins could not be
[47:49] taken away or anything it was just
[47:51] covered
[47:52] they had to do it once a year but when
[47:54] you place and believe that the sacrifice
[47:56] that jesus christ did for you on calvary
[47:59] and you triumph your sins are
[48:01] transferred to him
[48:04] and his righteousness is transferred to
[48:06] you
[48:08] therefore righteousness lives in me
[48:13] am i righteous in my own flesh no the
[48:15] righteous one living in me
[48:17] but this is a statement this is what
[48:20] really anchored it down to me
[48:22] you can't have one without the other
[48:25] oh i've come lord i've confessed my sins
[48:28] i've i've placed them in you
[48:30] and then you walk away and you just but
[48:32] i'm still a sinner i'm still no good
[48:35] or you say yes i'm the righteous one and
[48:37] they got in you you get people going to
[48:39] the other side but when you transfer
[48:41] your sins to him and he takes them he
[48:44] gives you his righteousness
[48:47] and in that righteousness is what we
[48:49] walk with
[48:50] because he said i am the resurrection
[48:53] now you're stopping all like i did
[48:56] and you're starting to look at yourself
[48:59] and say man there's there's a lot of
[49:01] things that aren't righteous in this guy
[49:04] but i'm not looking to that
[49:06] i'm looking to what he said
[49:09] because if i look to myself that's as
[49:12] far as i'll ever get but if i can take
[49:14] him at his word and walk on that i woke
[49:17] up this morning with my mind on jesus
[49:21] he's the word of god
[49:24] he became flesh the word of god became
[49:27] flesh he he wore the body of flesh
[49:30] so that he could understand that he
[49:32] could mediate for you that he could feel
[49:34] for you that all of that
[49:36] so when you take the word of god and you
[49:38] apply it to your life you are taking the
[49:40] very words of god you're taking god
[49:42] himself into your life and he says i am
[49:46] the resurrection
[49:47] it's not i will be
[49:50] but i am i'm living in you today
[49:53] again martha answers and and she says i
[49:56] know that he'll rise again
[49:58] and he says you're standing in front of
[50:01] the resurrection himself
[50:04] that's the word of god
[50:06] and then in mark
[50:08] chapter 11
[50:11] and i know that we read these scriptures
[50:13] and we hear these scriptures
[50:15] but they began to come life 23 and 24
[50:18] mark 11 23-24
[50:21] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[50:24] shall say unto this mountain
[50:26] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[50:29] the sea
[50:30] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[50:32] shall believe that those things which he
[50:34] saith shall come to pass
[50:36] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[50:40] therefore i say unto you these things so
[50:43] so ever you desire when you pray believe
[50:45] that you receive them and you shall have
[50:48] them
[50:49] now i remember as a kid hearing that and
[50:51] i imagine mountains
[50:55] physical mountains being moved
[50:57] that was as a child but i realized these
[51:00] catalina mountains don't give me any
[51:01] problems
[51:03] in fact i get more enjoyment out of the
[51:05] catalina mountains than the ones i get
[51:06] on here
[51:08] the ones that i create in my own life
[51:10] the things that i seem impossible hard
[51:12] to get over to get through
[51:14] but that's the mountains he's talking
[51:15] about
[51:16] because the disciples had just been with
[51:18] him and and jesus and they're going in
[51:20] and he's hungry
[51:22] and he comes up to a fig tree and the
[51:23] scripture tells us it wasn't even time
[51:25] for figs yet
[51:27] but he was hungry
[51:28] and because he saw there was no figs he
[51:30] cursed that tree he said you're going to
[51:32] die from your roots you're not going to
[51:34] give figs
[51:36] and when they come back peter is the one
[51:38] that managed he's marvel he said look
[51:39] the very the very tree that he cursed
[51:41] here in such a short time it's withered
[51:43] away it's all and jesus turns around and
[51:45] looks at me says whatsoever
[51:48] just understand this was a lesson for
[51:50] you to learn
[51:51] whatsoever you ask
[51:54] so i just want to to look at this and i
[51:56] want to see how god has done that for us
[51:59] in our life today we read a few quotes
[52:01] here
[52:03] from the handwriting on the wall
[52:09] he says remember it's the motives that
[52:11] you have towards anything that
[52:13] determines what you're going to get out
[52:15] of it
[52:16] i i i go and it's go sit down in a
[52:19] restaurant and
[52:21] brother noel has told me man that's a
[52:23] good restaurant it's a good place i
[52:25] really love the food there and i go i go
[52:27] with that anticipation it's gonna be
[52:28] good food
[52:30] now if it isn't good food it's not
[52:32] brother noel's
[52:34] fault
[52:35] for some reason but i go with that
[52:37] anticipation
[52:39] but if somebody told me and i know this
[52:41] this works i know this happens because
[52:43] brother green dismissed the service one
[52:45] night here
[52:46] years ago we were going to go visit
[52:48] another church
[52:50] and there was a brother who's going to
[52:51] minister he was well known brother i had
[52:53] never heard him and i was excited about
[52:55] getting to hear this brother minister
[52:58] but that day somebody told me do you
[53:00] know that this brother believes
[53:01] so-and-so
[53:04] and i sat through that whole service
[53:06] saying that was good brother but i know
[53:07] what you believe
[53:09] it had no effect on me
[53:11] had no good effect on me and i had no
[53:14] idea if the brother believed that or not
[53:16] but somebody said that to me
[53:18] and sometimes if we're not careful
[53:21] something will get we'll say something
[53:23] we'll do something with him and it'll
[53:25] break that possibility or that effect
[53:27] that it could have in your life where if
[53:29] you would come lord you know i need you
[53:31] today
[53:32] lord i have a desire for you today would
[53:34] you minister would you speak to me would
[53:36] you do something and not let everything
[53:38] else influence you there he says it's
[53:40] the motive that you have towards
[53:41] anything that term determines what
[53:43] you're going to get out of it
[53:45] it's your motives if your motive is
[53:47] right you'll be all right
[53:49] but always make your motives right serve
[53:51] the lord for one purpose because you
[53:54] love him
[53:55] not because you're afraid of hell not
[53:57] because you're afraid of dying but
[53:59] because you love him who loved you when
[54:02] you were unlovable that's it
[54:06] you know
[54:07] i've never seen anybody
[54:09] take a little child in their hands
[54:12] oh what a precious darling little thing
[54:14] lovely little thing
[54:16] but then they start to grow up
[54:19] and they start to
[54:20] and sometimes boy that's that same
[54:22] little child that i said
[54:24] oh what a beautiful kid i'd like to grab
[54:25] him by the neck right about now
[54:28] no that's probably just me but
[54:30] you know you understand what i mean you
[54:32] know he said he loved you when you were
[54:36] unlovable
[54:38] he looked past beyond all of that
[54:42] the conflict between
[54:43] god and satan
[54:46] he says
[54:49] see and if god made a promise that is
[54:51] eternal
[54:53] there's nothing nowhere can stop it
[54:55] they couldn't turn every atom upside
[54:57] down and turn it backwards could ever
[55:00] pierce the word of god one little word
[55:02] see because jesus said both heavens and
[55:04] earth will pass away
[55:06] but my word
[55:08] shall never fail see that's the best
[55:10] weapon there is
[55:12] it's the word
[55:13] of the eternal god
[55:15] that never fails
[55:18] and another quote on from that same
[55:20] message conflict between god and satan
[55:26] he's standing out there for his children
[55:28] and i just it was just a short quote
[55:30] whatever he's standing out there for his
[55:32] children what are we scared about the
[55:35] rapture is sure the coming is sure every
[55:38] blessing that's been promised is ours
[55:41] all belongs to us now
[55:44] then he says we kind of slack up and say
[55:47] satan say come around over this side
[55:49] i'll reason that out with you
[55:51] oh you got behind the father again he
[55:53] says don't do that
[55:56] don't start listening to your own
[55:58] reasoning
[55:59] to your own figuring
[56:01] i know he's the lord god the hill of my
[56:03] disease but this pain has been with me
[56:05] for
[56:06] however amount of time he's still the
[56:08] lord god
[56:09] he said don't start to reason it because
[56:11] it doesn't take long when you start
[56:13] figuring well i must have done something
[56:14] wrong i must and pretty fun you've got a
[56:17] mess in your hands
[56:19] well you can stand there say that's what
[56:21] god's word says
[56:22] and that's what i'll stand on
[56:26] the message paradox
[56:30] and this this kind of i want to get to
[56:34] this thought today
[56:38] it's
[56:38] again maybe another part from last
[56:40] sunday who i am lord
[56:43] not who not questioning who am i
[56:45] but who i am standing on that
[56:48] i see a woman raise her hand just then
[56:51] back in the building praising the lord
[56:53] it was hattie wright sitting down there
[56:55] and when she had two boys if they'll
[56:57] excuse me in saying this renegades boys
[57:00] of the world
[57:01] that little woman sitting there day that
[57:03] day a widow and i said hattie the lord
[57:05] god
[57:06] you said the right thing
[57:08] he provided the squirrels he's jehovah
[57:11] jireh she said
[57:12] that's nothing but the truth
[57:15] of god oh she said the right thing
[57:18] it seems incredible that a human being
[57:21] could speak a word
[57:24] well that's god
[57:26] that's god
[57:28] but it seems incredible that you could
[57:29] say something and god does it
[57:34] this is my beloved son he says hear ye
[57:37] him this is my beloved son in who i am
[57:40] well pleased
[57:43] was that for jesus only
[57:45] now that's for all his children
[57:48] so thinking on that line
[57:50] speaking the right thing
[57:52] saying the right thing
[57:54] doing the right thing
[57:56] pleasing god
[57:58] standing by faith walking by faith
[58:01] recognizing that you are a son and
[58:03] daughter of god
[58:05] not just on sunday church and wednesday
[58:07] church
[58:08] but 24 hours a day
[58:10] 365
[58:12] days of the year all the time you are
[58:15] have always been a child of god
[58:18] brother branham was and i don't know
[58:20] that he was the first but he was a
[58:22] seventh eighth messenger to get it out
[58:24] to the people you were a thought
[58:27] and you're an expression of god today
[58:31] sometimes our thoughts stay in our mind
[58:34] for a long time
[58:36] sometimes you want to think about
[58:37] something you want to meditate on it you
[58:39] want to you want when you say it you
[58:41] want to present it the right way
[58:44] and and
[58:45] the bad times are when you don't think
[58:47] about it long enough and you say
[58:48] something it comes out wrong and you
[58:50] always say boy i wish i could take all
[58:51] of that back today
[58:54] but god in his mind saw you already
[58:58] the bible says he was a lamb slain from
[59:00] before the foundation of the world so he
[59:03] knew there were going to be people that
[59:05] were going to need to be saved they were
[59:08] going to need to be healed that we're
[59:09] going to need to be cleansed they were
[59:11] going to need to be redeemed back
[59:13] and he made preparation for that
[59:15] in his mind he had seen it already
[59:18] so as as we look at that and god begins
[59:21] to unveil that
[59:23] in it through each one of the age each
[59:24] messenger paul
[59:26] takes in and a good portion of the new
[59:28] testament is written
[59:30] or or dictated by paul may be written by
[59:33] others but they were the words of paul
[59:35] that we're saying which were the words
[59:37] of god to us today
[59:39] it wasn't paul's uh being able to figure
[59:42] out this because paul was going to
[59:44] persecute was persecuting the christian
[59:46] who was going against god
[59:48] in his self-righteous way he said no
[59:51] the the law what moses brought that
[59:53] that's god
[59:56] and didn't realize what was what had
[59:58] changed but then he meets god himself
[1:00:03] and in the meeting of god
[1:00:05] two things happen
[1:00:07] you recognize god
[1:00:09] and you go with him
[1:00:11] or you turn your back and you go the
[1:00:13] other way
[1:00:14] there's no neutral neutral place to
[1:00:16] stand there
[1:00:18] you make your decision one way or the
[1:00:20] other
[1:00:21] but the seed of god responds back to god
[1:00:24] and that's why you're here today
[1:00:27] i i don't i don't recall ever thinking
[1:00:29] in my young life
[1:00:31] when i get about 16 years old the
[1:00:33] message of the age the hour's going to
[1:00:35] come
[1:00:36] it's going to change my life i'm going
[1:00:38] to move to tucson and i'm going to meet
[1:00:40] my wife there i'm going to no i didn't
[1:00:42] know any of that was going but god did
[1:00:45] god
[1:00:46] god arranged the events
[1:00:49] in our life my father and mother's life
[1:00:52] for us to get to this place
[1:00:55] 19 late 1974 dad injures his back and
[1:00:58] work
[1:01:01] and then he's fully disabled and can't
[1:01:04] work anymore
[1:01:06] i do remember him saying he wanted out
[1:01:08] of southern california even back then it
[1:01:10] was not a good place to be
[1:01:12] we had no idea a message was coming our
[1:01:14] way
[1:01:15] but about time a mess god had prepared a
[1:01:18] way
[1:01:19] for us to be able to come
[1:01:22] i didn't know that i didn't plan that
[1:01:24] but god had in his mind
[1:01:26] and we have to believe that everything
[1:01:28] in our life
[1:01:30] is ordered by god
[1:01:32] even when you make a mistake even when
[1:01:35] you fail even when you go the wrong way
[1:01:38] or else i don't think he would have used
[1:01:40] the prodigal son
[1:01:42] when he's talking about the prodigal son
[1:01:44] who just walks out of his father's house
[1:01:46] says give me my inheritance i'm going to
[1:01:48] go live my own life
[1:01:50] and jesus talks about that but then the
[1:01:53] son comes to one day and he realizes in
[1:01:55] my father's house
[1:01:58] their slaves or the servants have it
[1:02:00] better than i do where i am
[1:02:03] now watch his attitude i am no longer
[1:02:07] good enough to be a son
[1:02:10] i'm not worthy to be called his son
[1:02:13] i'm going to go back which was the best
[1:02:16] thing he could have done
[1:02:18] but his attitudes changed
[1:02:20] i'm no longer good enough to be a son
[1:02:23] i'll just go back and i'll go back to my
[1:02:26] father's house but i'll just be a
[1:02:28] servant
[1:02:30] but the father has been looking for his
[1:02:32] son
[1:02:35] the bible doesn't say anything about any
[1:02:37] qualifications outside of it's my son
[1:02:42] so when the son comes up to the father
[1:02:44] and he says father i have sinned against
[1:02:46] thee.
[1:02:48] we've all been there we've all done that
[1:02:51] i'm not worthy to be called your son
[1:02:53] anymore
[1:02:54] i i'm just you know just relegate me to
[1:02:57] the back and that'll be okay
[1:02:59] and he said no no no you are my son
[1:03:03] i've been waiting for your return
[1:03:06] i've been waiting for you to recognize
[1:03:07] that you are my son and you come back
[1:03:09] home
[1:03:12] understand you've made a mistake you've
[1:03:14] made you've done things in your life
[1:03:17] but you're still a son and daughter of
[1:03:18] god
[1:03:19] and he's telling you come home
[1:03:23] so we see that he says
[1:03:25] she said
[1:03:26] that's nothing but the truth
[1:03:31] and god tells brother branham you tell
[1:03:33] her
[1:03:34] she can have anything she wants
[1:03:37] when you read that brother brown said if
[1:03:38] she had asked for a million dollars
[1:03:40] today we might up that a little bit
[1:03:43] 25 million
[1:03:46] would have made a difference to god
[1:03:47] he owns a cattle in a thousand hills
[1:03:50] every vein of gold every ounce of silver
[1:03:52] is his
[1:03:53] it all belongs to him
[1:03:54] he said she can have
[1:03:56] but a child of god
[1:03:58] doesn't look for personal wealth
[1:04:00] and personal uh to be known a child
[1:04:03] looks at god how can i help somebody
[1:04:05] else have this that i have
[1:04:08] and she turns around the salvation of my
[1:04:11] two boys
[1:04:13] immediately that's how child god
[1:04:18] and and you know it's it's amazing
[1:04:21] how many times
[1:04:22] god has said you say
[1:04:25] you say
[1:04:26] you speak
[1:04:28] it's it's easy to put it on on a brother
[1:04:31] a minister
[1:04:33] something like that but he's telling you
[1:04:37] sometimes you're alone in a situation
[1:04:39] alone in a place somewhere all by
[1:04:40] yourself and there's nobody to call
[1:04:44] but you and god are a majority over any
[1:04:46] situation
[1:04:48] and you have to recognize who you are
[1:04:52] i was just recounting some things in in
[1:04:55] my own life
[1:04:57] and and
[1:04:59] god has done in my own life personally
[1:05:01] just to let me know how mindful he is of
[1:05:04] me
[1:05:07] and and never once has he come up to me
[1:05:09] and said
[1:05:10] now i'm going to do this for you today
[1:05:14] but if you ever mess up again
[1:05:16] this is the last one
[1:05:19] now he has taken me and done this to me
[1:05:22] to get my attention he has done this to
[1:05:24] me to get my attention he has done this
[1:05:27] to me to get my attention
[1:05:29] but when god does that he does it for
[1:05:32] your good yes
[1:05:34] not always in anger uh like sometimes we
[1:05:37] as parents did it or do it still
[1:05:39] sometimes
[1:05:40] except for my girls i know they never
[1:05:42] make me angry so that's
[1:05:47] i thank the lord for my family i know i
[1:05:49] call them out quite a bit but the lord
[1:05:50] has blessed me with a wonderful family
[1:05:53] and i appreciate that so
[1:05:55] but to think about things that god has
[1:05:57] done i i asked i gave the picture
[1:05:59] to brother jordan and then brother jerry
[1:06:01] jeremy came back and they didn't get it
[1:06:03] so hopefully
[1:06:04] did you get that picture
[1:06:06] can we put that up
[1:06:08] no not that picture
[1:06:18] i never did name him
[1:06:20] but he sits on the wall up at the cabin
[1:06:24] and
[1:06:25] this is the last week that's my boss's
[1:06:27] cabin because he sold it
[1:06:29] and so we won't be able to use it again
[1:06:32] but that's the elk
[1:06:34] my sister shirley moore let me use one
[1:06:36] of her guns
[1:06:37] i was going hunting and that's how the
[1:06:39] lord gave me there
[1:06:42] and i know how that out came
[1:06:46] into hunt thank you brothers
[1:06:49] um
[1:06:50] we were out hunting there was my boss my
[1:06:53] old boss and three were using his cabin
[1:06:55] this i think it'll be five years
[1:06:57] this coming november
[1:07:00] and uh my boss got his elk on friday
[1:07:03] so saturday we went back to that same
[1:07:05] place he said this let's hunt from the
[1:07:07] same area
[1:07:08] and i'll sit up above you and i'll i'll
[1:07:10] um
[1:07:11] i'll watch and you watch the left side
[1:07:13] i'll watch the right side so that we're
[1:07:14] not swiveling the whole time
[1:07:17] and and
[1:07:18] so we're sitting there and it's the sun
[1:07:20] has come up and and what happened there
[1:07:22] were so many hunters they were
[1:07:23] everywhere
[1:07:25] that they move around so much that the
[1:07:26] elk began to run out and that was a
[1:07:28] thing so to my right i hear him say to
[1:07:31] you right to your right and i turn and
[1:07:32] there's two elk running across about 100
[1:07:34] yards out running through the meadow
[1:07:36] and i pick my gun up and i'm
[1:07:39] i shoot twice and i miss twice my boss
[1:07:42] says man there must be something wrong
[1:07:44] with the gun i said nothing to do with
[1:07:45] the gun that was me
[1:07:47] you know every time the elk went down my
[1:07:48] gun went up and it was quite a bit a
[1:07:50] little bit opposite
[1:07:52] so we were sitting there and
[1:07:55] he i never rifle hunted like that i'd
[1:07:57] always archery hunted and
[1:07:58] he kind of told me what to do and we
[1:08:00] kind of went over it and he said get
[1:08:02] behind that log and use the one of the
[1:08:04] branches to steady the rifle and he says
[1:08:07] you watch to the left i'll watch to the
[1:08:08] right
[1:08:09] we're sitting there
[1:08:11] and i know how the lord speaks to me and
[1:08:13] each one of you should know how god
[1:08:15] speaks to you
[1:08:16] you should you should understand when
[1:08:18] it's the lord getting your attention
[1:08:19] because you've experienced
[1:08:21] enough times
[1:08:25] and he has spoken to me four times
[1:08:26] audibly
[1:08:28] the angel of the lord what is four times
[1:08:30] in my life
[1:08:31] but this time it was just an impression
[1:08:33] of a thought in my mind and he just
[1:08:35] asked me
[1:08:36] what are you here for
[1:08:40] and my first response i'll just be
[1:08:41] honest with you i just said that's for
[1:08:43] brother branham lord
[1:08:46] and he waited a little bit and he said
[1:08:48] what are you here for and again i said
[1:08:50] but that was for brother branham lord
[1:08:54] and the third time he asked me again
[1:08:56] what are you here for
[1:09:00] and about then i began to understand
[1:09:03] he's talking to
[1:09:04] me we're sitting on this side there's
[1:09:07] it's a small meadow there's a hill up on
[1:09:10] this side and i could see a trail and we
[1:09:12] had scoped out the distances so i knew
[1:09:14] how far it would wouldn't have to figure
[1:09:15] it out that's 100 yards that's 150 yards
[1:09:18] that's you know like that
[1:09:20] and there was a trail it came down kind
[1:09:22] of curl like this came right down the
[1:09:23] middle
[1:09:24] and then came right in front of us
[1:09:26] and i said lord i wanted to from up
[1:09:28] there come down that trail come this way
[1:09:31] and right here in front that's all i
[1:09:34] said
[1:09:35] sat there and a little bit later i look
[1:09:37] up in the beginning that trail where i
[1:09:39] could see it came over the ridge
[1:09:41] there's two elk there
[1:09:44] but the
[1:09:45] trees cover their heads so i couldn't
[1:09:47] tell if they were bulls or they were
[1:09:48] cows
[1:09:50] so i get my boss's attention i said the
[1:09:52] two elk up there and he says don't shoot
[1:09:54] the first one shoot the second one
[1:09:56] and i said but i have a heart shot at
[1:09:58] the first he goes now wait till they
[1:09:59] move
[1:10:00] so the first one steps down it was it
[1:10:01] was a ball but real small
[1:10:03] and then this one stepped out
[1:10:07] and i put the shot right through his
[1:10:08] heart knocked him down right there we
[1:10:10] got over and we got our elk
[1:10:13] but it took me a little while the first
[1:10:16] elk ran down that trail
[1:10:18] came down the middle ran right in front
[1:10:20] of us turned around and ran back exactly
[1:10:23] what i asked for
[1:10:25] but it took me a couple hours to realize
[1:10:28] that what i asked for god had done
[1:10:34] you have to come that in your life
[1:10:37] because it's you and god
[1:10:40] it's easy to give it to the minister
[1:10:42] it's easy to give it to this brother
[1:10:43] it's easy to give it to brother branham
[1:10:45] to paul but what about your life
[1:10:48] recognizing who you are and what god
[1:10:51] does for you in your life
[1:10:54] and i've shared these things and these
[1:10:55] are new
[1:10:57] here back here when the kids were all
[1:10:59] much younger and they would all play
[1:11:01] ball after on a sunday night they'd all
[1:11:02] be the boys were playing basketball the
[1:11:04] kids were running around
[1:11:06] and there was a young little girl she
[1:11:07] was probably about four or five years
[1:11:08] old she was running around
[1:11:10] and something happened to her and i
[1:11:11] didn't see that part
[1:11:13] but sister
[1:11:14] sandra miles picked her up
[1:11:17] maybe she was three four or a little
[1:11:18] smaller and she comes up to me and says
[1:11:20] brother erin
[1:11:21] look at her and her head had rolled back
[1:11:24] and her eyes had gone white
[1:11:26] and i didn't think
[1:11:28] i just reached my hand i said little
[1:11:30] sister in the name of lord jesus christ
[1:11:32] i give you back your life
[1:11:34] that's the words that came out
[1:11:36] her eyes rolled right back up and she
[1:11:38] said put me down he should put down and
[1:11:40] she ran off full speed
[1:11:43] i don't know what was wrong with her it
[1:11:44] didn't make a difference
[1:11:46] i just gave her back her life in the
[1:11:48] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:11:51] that's what god does
[1:11:54] i'll just share some of these things
[1:11:55] personally for me and you know what
[1:11:58] it doesn't keep me forever i should have
[1:12:01] a daily experience with god every day
[1:12:04] i filled my car up with gas once and
[1:12:06] i've never had to do it again no every
[1:12:08] time it runs out of gas i got to put gas
[1:12:10] again
[1:12:12] every day should be a fresh walk with
[1:12:14] the lord jesus every day there should be
[1:12:15] something about your life
[1:12:17] every single day
[1:12:19] i woke up this world this morning with
[1:12:21] my mind stayed on jesus
[1:12:24] sometimes you're halfway down the road
[1:12:25] and say oh lord sorry i forgot to say
[1:12:27] good morning to you
[1:12:29] but it should be the other way around
[1:12:32] sitting at my kitchen table
[1:12:35] having lunch
[1:12:37] late lunch i got i got home from work
[1:12:39] nobody was home i was sitting there
[1:12:42] and something in my heart and i just
[1:12:43] spoke it out and i said lord
[1:12:45] is everything okay between me and you
[1:12:49] that's all i asked
[1:12:51] and i heard a noise and i look out to
[1:12:53] the window looking west
[1:12:56] i'm hearing a noise but there's there
[1:12:57] the tree there is not being moved
[1:13:00] but suddenly my
[1:13:01] back door the kitchen door opens and a
[1:13:04] little whirlwind is right there at the
[1:13:05] door just spinning like this
[1:13:07] and i look both right and it's the only
[1:13:10] place because this tree and that chair
[1:13:11] are not even moving
[1:13:13] and it opens the door just blew the door
[1:13:15] open and it stood there
[1:13:17] and then it just went out on its own
[1:13:20] and the peace that came with that
[1:13:23] because you know god works that way
[1:13:25] well he's done that many of times
[1:13:29] and he just said it's okay
[1:13:31] it's okay
[1:13:32] you might be going through some hard
[1:13:34] times in your life
[1:13:36] some of the hardest times are right here
[1:13:38] but then there's other things that are
[1:13:40] difficult think actual events is tough
[1:13:42] but god comes by and says my peace i
[1:13:45] give unto you
[1:13:47] not as the world gives it so not in a
[1:13:49] little pill it's not in a bottle it's
[1:13:52] not in this entertainment it's god in
[1:13:54] you
[1:13:56] that's the peace
[1:13:58] and another time sitting in my company
[1:14:00] van
[1:14:01] having lunch parked on the side road
[1:14:04] i look up and there's a little whirlwind
[1:14:05] coming down the street
[1:14:08] and the uh palo verdes had been began to
[1:14:11] drop all their little yellow leaves
[1:14:13] and it picked them up and it made a
[1:14:15] bouquet
[1:14:16] of little yellow leaves just coming down
[1:14:18] this way
[1:14:20] and it went around my van and then went
[1:14:22] on
[1:14:23] it didn't come through the van it just
[1:14:25] kind of went around it like it knew
[1:14:27] where it was going and what it was doing
[1:14:30] and again
[1:14:31] i just all i could do was say thank you
[1:14:33] lord
[1:14:34] you're mindful of me
[1:14:36] recognizing that god
[1:14:38] loves you god cares
[1:14:40] now you're saying well now brother aaron
[1:14:43] that should have been for a lady i'll
[1:14:44] tell you i'll take whatever god does for
[1:14:46] me
[1:14:48] if he wants to hand me a bouquet of
[1:14:50] flowers and this lord i'll gladly
[1:14:51] receive them
[1:14:54] just under realize that's how god is
[1:14:58] however he deals with you however he
[1:14:59] talks it whatever he makes known to you
[1:15:02] that should be in your life
[1:15:04] recognizing god is mindful of you he
[1:15:06] knows your name
[1:15:07] i've shared the times in the scripture
[1:15:09] when i asked him i said lord do you know
[1:15:11] my name
[1:15:12] do you know where i live those were the
[1:15:14] exact words and i sent them out loud
[1:15:17] i opened the bible in the false to
[1:15:18] psalms 115 if you'll pull that up i know
[1:15:21] i didn't give you psalms 1 15
[1:15:23] verse 9.
[1:15:26] and i i don't remember mama had just
[1:15:27] said go go to the room
[1:15:30] when the girls were younger and there
[1:15:31] were six of them and one of me sometimes
[1:15:33] i just went to the room
[1:15:35] it was just sometimes easier
[1:15:37] and then there was sometimes they
[1:15:38] probably wish i'd gone to the room but
[1:15:43] this is what the lord took me o israel
[1:15:44] trust now in the lord he is their help
[1:15:46] and their shield
[1:15:48] o house of aaron trust in the lord he is
[1:15:51] their help and their shield
[1:15:53] ye that fear the lord trust in the lord
[1:15:56] so you can put your name in there ye
[1:15:58] that fear of the lord trust in the lord
[1:15:59] he is their help and their shield
[1:16:02] the lord has been mindful of us he will
[1:16:04] bless us he will bless the house of the
[1:16:07] house of israel he will bless the house
[1:16:09] of aaron
[1:16:11] i didn't write that he did
[1:16:15] luke chapter one
[1:16:19] oh
[1:16:20] one of the very last verses of luke
[1:16:22] chapter one i just didn't write these
[1:16:24] down
[1:16:28] my daughter elizabeth
[1:16:31] came to the room
[1:16:33] one of the very last verses there
[1:16:36] of chapter one of luke
[1:16:41] it may be the very last verse
[1:16:45] she comes up to me and she she's happy
[1:16:47] she's excited
[1:16:49] and she she says dad you know how you
[1:16:52] asked
[1:16:54] the lord if he knew where you lived
[1:16:56] and your name
[1:16:58] watch what he did for me
[1:17:01] let's go to luke chapter one and i don't
[1:17:03] know if they
[1:17:08] that's the first chapter of luke
[1:17:21] i believe that's the one
[1:17:29] maybe i've got the wrong one there
[1:17:32] but my daughter elizabeth
[1:17:36] she says i asked the lord and you took
[1:17:38] me
[1:17:39] and he said and her name was elizabeth
[1:17:42] and she's from the house of aaron
[1:17:45] and it's in there i probably have the
[1:17:46] wrong scripture but she showed it to me
[1:17:50] god didn't write it that moment it was
[1:17:51] there already but god unveiled it then
[1:17:55] he's jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:17:57] today and forever
[1:18:01] there it is i'm sorry luke 1 5. i missed
[1:18:03] it by a few
[1:18:04] there was in the days of herod the king
[1:18:06] of judea a certain priest named
[1:18:07] zacharias of the course of abya and his
[1:18:10] wife was the daughter of aaron and her
[1:18:12] name was elizabeth now it does say wife
[1:18:14] but aaron elizabeth
[1:18:18] she said i asked the lord if he knew my
[1:18:19] name and where i was and that's exactly
[1:18:21] what he took me right to
[1:18:24] god is mindful god is aware
[1:18:27] and you have to be mindful and aware too
[1:18:30] not just that song that brother jordan
[1:18:32] just tied right in there
[1:18:34] and and again i say we don't sit down
[1:18:36] and discuss these and every once in a
[1:18:37] while i will ask the brothers or sister
[1:18:39] leila you know this song i plan to sing
[1:18:41] this song
[1:18:42] but so many times a song is sung or
[1:18:45] something has said a scripture is read a
[1:18:46] testimony is given ties right in so well
[1:18:50] that's what god does
[1:18:53] each one of you should have experiences
[1:18:55] like that in your life that god has done
[1:18:59] and you know god has done it for you
[1:19:01] it anchors it it makes it real to you
[1:19:05] it makes god mindful of you
[1:19:09] now the last quote and i was going to
[1:19:11] have the brothers play it and i forgot
[1:19:13] to name because it's fairly long
[1:19:15] but it's from the message he that is in
[1:19:17] you
[1:19:19] and it's the experience that brother
[1:19:20] branham has when he's up in the
[1:19:21] mountains
[1:19:23] in colorado
[1:19:25] and
[1:19:26] and he says how many experience have i
[1:19:28] had
[1:19:29] i pointed out to the brethren brother
[1:19:31] palmer and them in the places where the
[1:19:33] eagles you know i saw him rise up that
[1:19:35] day and you know that place where it all
[1:19:37] taken place in there
[1:19:39] it's a temperamental thing to me in
[1:19:41] there i've always had so many great
[1:19:43] experiences with my lord up in the
[1:19:45] mountains
[1:19:46] there should be a place
[1:19:48] in our lives set aside
[1:19:51] a time a place
[1:19:54] where we go and we mean business with
[1:19:56] god
[1:19:58] lord i'm setting this time aside i'm
[1:20:00] setting this place aside i'm nothing
[1:20:02] else you turn everything off
[1:20:06] maybe if it's in your room you tell your
[1:20:07] wife you tell children don't bother me
[1:20:09] for a while
[1:20:11] you know
[1:20:12] give me give me the quiet time i need to
[1:20:14] find god
[1:20:16] wherever that place is brother branham
[1:20:18] used to go to the cave
[1:20:21] places a different one brother green
[1:20:22] said he used to go when he would go and
[1:20:24] lock himself in that study room and lock
[1:20:26] the doors
[1:20:27] he knew to him that meant to god i'm not
[1:20:29] letting nothing interfere
[1:20:31] i need to hear from you
[1:20:33] brother branham is talking about this
[1:20:34] place he says
[1:20:36] i have so many great experience with my
[1:20:38] lord up there in the mountains you just
[1:20:39] can't go there without seeing him he's
[1:20:41] just everywhere
[1:20:43] so then as i
[1:20:44] i was there then the sleet started in
[1:20:46] the wind twisting like that and i said
[1:20:48] well i know the way down
[1:20:50] so i better get out of here right now so
[1:20:52] i said it looked down and i couldn't
[1:20:54] even see the bottoms no more them clouds
[1:20:56] were whirling around and twisting
[1:20:58] and sleep blowing and there it was the
[1:21:00] blizzard
[1:21:01] forecast for several days
[1:21:03] they knew it was coming they'd been
[1:21:05] telling them that storm was coming
[1:21:08] a a big blizzard coming brother tom is
[1:21:11] here brother tom simpson coming down
[1:21:12] from the canada heard the forecast and
[1:21:15] he was advised not to go through that
[1:21:17] part of the country
[1:21:18] because this forecast said it'll be
[1:21:20] blizzard where are you brother tom i
[1:21:22] think yeah right here the blizzard was
[1:21:24] coming everybody had done the set in for
[1:21:27] well i put my gun back under under my
[1:21:29] shirt like this my red shirt started
[1:21:31] walking down the mountain and as i
[1:21:33] started i got about a half a mile from
[1:21:36] the satellite oh my on that mountain
[1:21:38] just blowing i couldn't see the bottom
[1:21:40] no more i could see about 20 feet in
[1:21:43] front of me or 30 and i know to come
[1:21:45] right down this little what we call a
[1:21:46] little hog back little ridge then come
[1:21:49] off the creek and i know to follow the
[1:21:51] creek and where to go it got real bad
[1:21:55] i think he said quite a bit there now it
[1:21:56] got real bad
[1:21:58] emphasizing
[1:21:59] and yeah so then i get started and got
[1:22:02] about halfway down there and something
[1:22:03] said to me just as plain as you hear me
[1:22:06] stop and go
[1:22:08] back
[1:22:12] in the middle of a storm
[1:22:14] that's getting bad and something says
[1:22:17] stop and go back and when you had enough
[1:22:21] experience with him
[1:22:24] and he tells you stop and go back
[1:22:27] you don't question it
[1:22:30] you don't argue with him about it you've
[1:22:32] learned your lessons
[1:22:34] you turn you say yes lord
[1:22:37] he talks about that instant when the the
[1:22:39] plane is brought down in in tennessee
[1:22:42] because a sister
[1:22:43] was asking for god where's your elijah
[1:22:47] she identified herself with the
[1:22:48] scripture and said so if i identify with
[1:22:50] that scripture then there has to be an
[1:22:52] elijah for that time
[1:22:54] and god brings an airplane down and
[1:22:56] sends his his prophet the elijah of this
[1:22:58] day
[1:22:59] this time here to go down walking that
[1:23:01] way but didn't tell him why
[1:23:03] but he understood god said go so i go
[1:23:08] well i thought what was i thinking about
[1:23:10] maybe it's just my mind and we all have
[1:23:12] that sometimes was that just me you
[1:23:14] begin to question it
[1:23:16] is it
[1:23:17] and i just couldn't make another step
[1:23:19] forward david had fixed him his sandwich
[1:23:21] that morning and i think he tried to get
[1:23:23] even with me for fixing his daddy one
[1:23:26] one time of onion and honey
[1:23:28] and that's all we had so he fixed me a
[1:23:30] bologna you know i i don't know what it
[1:23:32] was wrapped up in there and i had it in
[1:23:34] my shirt and it then got wet through my
[1:23:36] shirt and i thought i'll just stop and
[1:23:38] eat this and maybe i'll be all right
[1:23:39] again so i pulled out the sandwich about
[1:23:42] 10 o'clock and i started eating this
[1:23:43] sandwich and as i and as i eat the
[1:23:45] sandwich i thought now i'll be all right
[1:23:48] and i started to move on but something
[1:23:50] said go back where you come from
[1:23:53] go back right through the storm half a
[1:23:55] mile more back up the mountain and into
[1:23:57] the dark timber
[1:23:59] where you can hardly see as far as that
[1:24:01] organ but i'm going to be an old man and
[1:24:03] i've been a christian along now for 33
[1:24:05] years
[1:24:06] now for 33 years and i know no matter
[1:24:08] what how ridiculous it seems mind the
[1:24:12] lord do what the lord says
[1:24:15] and i turned back and went back to the
[1:24:17] saddle feeling my way back
[1:24:19] all the sleep getting harder and harder
[1:24:21] getting darker and darker and i sat down
[1:24:23] there and just put my coat up like this
[1:24:25] over my shirt over the scope again sat
[1:24:27] down i thought what am i doing here
[1:24:30] what why would i come back here
[1:24:34] you just got to take god at his word and
[1:24:37] trust him
[1:24:40] and when you've had an extra experience
[1:24:41] with him you trust him
[1:24:44] you wait on the lord and said yes lord
[1:24:48] he says
[1:24:51] and i just waited a few minutes it's
[1:24:52] hard to get up again and just as plain
[1:24:54] as i ever want to hear a voice said i am
[1:24:57] the creator of heavens and earth i make
[1:25:00] the winds and the rain
[1:25:01] i took off my hat he realized that i
[1:25:04] said great jehovah is that you he said
[1:25:07] i was the one who made the winds to
[1:25:09] cease upon the sea i was the one who
[1:25:12] made the waves go down i created heavens
[1:25:14] and earth
[1:25:16] was not
[1:25:17] was not i not the one that told you to
[1:25:19] speak to the for those squirrels and
[1:25:20] they came into existence i am god
[1:25:25] and i thank the lord that he reminds us
[1:25:27] sometimes
[1:25:28] he says wasn't that me
[1:25:31] wasn't that me and your life there
[1:25:32] didn't i do this for you wasn't that
[1:25:36] so
[1:25:37] he's just re-encouraging you he's not
[1:25:39] scolding you he's just trying to get you
[1:25:41] to understand it's me
[1:25:43] he says
[1:25:47] now when a voice speaks to you watch a
[1:25:49] scripture if it's not scriptural you
[1:25:50] leave it alone i don't care how plain it
[1:25:53] is you stay away from i said yes lord
[1:25:56] he said speak to those winds and storm
[1:25:59] and it will go away
[1:26:04] he didn't say tell me
[1:26:06] to say this he said you speak to the
[1:26:09] storm
[1:26:12] it's so easy to complain about a storm
[1:26:14] it's so easy to murmur about a storm
[1:26:17] but that's not what he said he said
[1:26:19] speak to the storm
[1:26:24] the storm of your own life the storm
[1:26:26] that's going between your ears sometimes
[1:26:29] the storm of the situation in your
[1:26:30] family speak to that storm
[1:26:33] i am the lord god that healeth all thy
[1:26:35] diseases
[1:26:37] he says speak to that storm
[1:26:39] that situation i own the cattle of a
[1:26:42] thousand hills
[1:26:44] is there anything too hard for the lord
[1:26:47] he begins to remind you who he is
[1:26:51] and what he does
[1:26:52] and he's telling you speak to that story
[1:26:56] and he says
[1:26:58] now the bible lays before me which
[1:27:00] my life is is in that and i raise up and
[1:27:03] i said i do not doubt your voice lord i
[1:27:05] said clouds snow rain sleet i resent
[1:27:09] your coming in the name of jesus christ
[1:27:12] go to your place i say that the sun must
[1:27:14] come out immediately and shine for four
[1:27:17] days till our hunting trip is over and i
[1:27:19] leave with my brethren
[1:27:21] it was just gushing like when whoosh
[1:27:23] like that it started going going whoosh
[1:27:26] and then it went
[1:27:27] just down to nothing stop
[1:27:30] i stood still my brethren up there are
[1:27:32] wondering what's happening in the sleep
[1:27:33] the rain stop there come a wind whirling
[1:27:35] around through the mountains lifted up
[1:27:37] the clouds one went this way east north
[1:27:40] west south and within a few minutes the
[1:27:42] sun was shining nice and warm that's the
[1:27:45] truth
[1:27:46] god knows that's truth i just stood
[1:27:49] there looking around
[1:27:50] with my hat off looking at i i say i got
[1:27:53] numb all over
[1:27:54] i thought the very god of creation it's
[1:27:57] all in his hands what what's he's
[1:28:00] telling me i picked up my gun wiped off
[1:28:02] the scope
[1:28:03] starting to walk
[1:28:05] go back down the hill and something said
[1:28:07] to me why don't you stroll with me
[1:28:10] through this wilderness walk with me
[1:28:14] was that for brother branham only
[1:28:17] was that for just the disciples
[1:28:20] i've heard that
[1:28:21] i was talking to a landlord
[1:28:24] and he asked me he saw my girls when
[1:28:25] they were little and he said what kind
[1:28:26] of christian are we going to tell him
[1:28:28] and he said well what do you believe i
[1:28:30] said i believe jesus christ is the same
[1:28:31] yesterday today and forever and he stops
[1:28:34] me goes no no that was just for the
[1:28:35] disciples
[1:28:38] we went at it for a few minutes and i
[1:28:40] realized i wasn't going to change him
[1:28:42] but i also knew he wasn't going to
[1:28:43] change me because i had already
[1:28:45] experienced the lord
[1:28:47] and he began to tell me no that's why
[1:28:49] god gives us hospital psychiatrists and
[1:28:51] doctors today
[1:28:52] god doesn't do those things anymore i
[1:28:54] just said you're a little too late
[1:28:56] because god has done it for me
[1:28:58] you can't reason though you just have to
[1:29:00] stand because you know him to be true
[1:29:05] he says why don't you stroll with me
[1:29:07] through the windows walk with me i said
[1:29:09] yes lord with all my heart it'd be one
[1:29:12] of the greatest things i could do was
[1:29:13] walk with you
[1:29:15] so i put my gun over my shoulder and i
[1:29:16] started walking down through that
[1:29:19] never anaxilated to it virgin timber
[1:29:21] walking through here and as i did walk
[1:29:23] down along the game trails i felt like i
[1:29:26] believe i will go to the place there
[1:29:27] yesterday was our anniversary and i will
[1:29:29] stand there just a few minutes just as a
[1:29:31] little salute to mita because that's
[1:29:33] where he took her on their anniversary
[1:29:34] of their first wedding he said i
[1:29:36] couldn't afford an anniversary and i was
[1:29:38] going hunting so i took her to the
[1:29:39] mountains to go hunting with me
[1:29:43] okay brothers that's that's
[1:29:45] don't do don't do it okay
[1:29:50] where there's a little bunch of quaking
[1:29:52] aspen it was a little knob and i said i
[1:29:54] believe i'll go up there's a salute to
[1:29:55] our anniversary and they'll go back down
[1:29:57] the other side
[1:29:58] and the dark timbers walk around and go
[1:30:00] over by towards corral peaks and come
[1:30:02] back down that way and just walk in
[1:30:04] androids and i was saying father i know
[1:30:06] you're walking with me and what a
[1:30:08] privilege
[1:30:09] there is nobody greater that i could be
[1:30:11] walking with this
[1:30:13] the very god
[1:30:15] and the warm sunshine
[1:30:19] that god would love a sinner such as i
[1:30:23] and you
[1:30:25] you got to be willing to put your name
[1:30:26] in there
[1:30:28] and i think when he gets down and the
[1:30:30] rest of the quote there
[1:30:32] he gets down into to town
[1:30:35] and the gas station antenna says man it
[1:30:37] was a bad storm but it just disappeared
[1:30:39] all sudden
[1:30:41] brother bran really didn't didn't he
[1:30:43] doesn't elaborate to them what happened
[1:30:45] but he knew what it had taken place
[1:30:48] god is mindful of his children
[1:30:51] god loves his children
[1:30:53] but you have to recognize that for
[1:30:55] yourself
[1:30:58] brother sister
[1:31:00] a child that's old enough to begin to
[1:31:02] understand you've got to recognize that
[1:31:04] for yourself
[1:31:06] that god would stop the whole world for
[1:31:08] one of his children
[1:31:11] to meet that need there was daniel in
[1:31:13] the lion's den
[1:31:15] god said hold on a second we've got to
[1:31:17] go down let's put everything on the hole
[1:31:19] i got to go meet with him
[1:31:20] there's three three boys that get
[1:31:23] getting ready to get tossed into a
[1:31:24] furnace a fire
[1:31:26] and he says i'm not sending an angel
[1:31:28] down i'm going down there myself
[1:31:31] you've got to come to that place in your
[1:31:32] life they realize that god is mindful of
[1:31:34] you and he cares for you
[1:31:38] and you mean more to him
[1:31:41] than his own life
[1:31:44] he gave his life for me
[1:31:48] he gave and took my sin my iniquity my
[1:31:51] filth my everything and bore it himself
[1:31:55] so that i could have his righteousness
[1:32:00] and if he gives it to you he doesn't
[1:32:02] take it back
[1:32:04] he didn't put
[1:32:05] i said you're righteous if you meet
[1:32:07] these standards
[1:32:11] he didn't say if you can memorize x
[1:32:13] amount if you do x amount like many
[1:32:14] churches teach today this is how you
[1:32:17] earn his righteousness
[1:32:19] no he just said accept what i did for
[1:32:21] you
[1:32:22] transfer what you got give it to me and
[1:32:24] i'll give you what i got back to you
[1:32:29] well i i know who came up got the better
[1:32:31] half
[1:32:34] oh but he has a sea of god's
[1:32:35] forgetfulness that he just tosses it
[1:32:37] just tosses it just tosses it it's not
[1:32:40] there anymore
[1:32:43] ephesians chapter 3
[1:32:46] verses 14 to 20.
[1:32:52] this is the word of god
[1:32:56] god inspired paul
[1:32:58] god inspired different uh
[1:33:00] vote different people to write to record
[1:33:03] to speak and have it recorded
[1:33:05] in our day they're able to physically
[1:33:07] record you can actually watch things
[1:33:09] happening live god has allowed all that
[1:33:11] to happen
[1:33:12] we'll have no excuse to sell god i
[1:33:14] didn't know
[1:33:16] because we do know
[1:33:19] paul says for this cause i bound my
[1:33:21] knees unto the father of our lord jesus
[1:33:23] christ for this cause lord i love you
[1:33:26] amen i'm willing to give my all for you
[1:33:30] for all these things that you've done
[1:33:32] all the things that you will do the
[1:33:34] things you're doing it it's to god it's
[1:33:36] present
[1:33:37] to us sometimes we say that this and
[1:33:40] that but to god it's present
[1:33:43] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:33:45] earth is named
[1:33:47] he didn't just say this is just for me
[1:33:49] but the whole family of god is named he
[1:33:53] says
[1:33:54] that he would grant you according to the
[1:33:55] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:33:58] with
[1:34:00] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:34:02] man
[1:34:04] that part inside of you that's god
[1:34:08] the seed gene of god
[1:34:10] and and
[1:34:12] it's hard sometimes to to understand
[1:34:14] that men but something in your heart
[1:34:16] better say amen to that there better be
[1:34:18] a response to that say yes lord
[1:34:21] that's you and me
[1:34:22] paul says that christ in you the hope of
[1:34:25] glory
[1:34:28] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:34:31] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:34:34] in love
[1:34:37] love is the basis of it all
[1:34:41] because love produced grace
[1:34:44] and mercy
[1:34:46] and forgiveness
[1:34:47] and a willingness to say i love you
[1:34:50] you're my son you're my daughter
[1:34:54] see without love it re produces a law
[1:34:57] because he told them
[1:34:59] it says you chose to be like other
[1:35:01] countries you chose to be like other
[1:35:02] kingdoms you wanted a king to rule over
[1:35:04] you when i would have been your king
[1:35:08] i would have ruled with mercy and with
[1:35:10] love and with grace but you chose to go
[1:35:12] that way and because of that now look
[1:35:15] what you're doing
[1:35:18] but to us he says no grace is given to
[1:35:20] you
[1:35:21] mercy's given to you
[1:35:23] and that you may be able to comprehend
[1:35:25] with all the saints what is the breath
[1:35:28] and the length and the depth and the
[1:35:30] height
[1:35:32] is there depth in eternity
[1:35:36] is there breath in eternity breath and
[1:35:38] width
[1:35:39] is there length is there height no it's
[1:35:42] eternity
[1:35:43] it's immeasurable
[1:35:45] and and
[1:35:47] we can take and put all one word
[1:35:48] eternity
[1:35:50] but can you comprehend it that way no
[1:35:53] but that's just what it's eternal and to
[1:35:55] know the love of christ which passes
[1:35:57] knowledge
[1:35:58] that ye might be filled with all the
[1:36:01] fullness of god
[1:36:05] how much does it take
[1:36:07] to have the fullness of god
[1:36:10] brother branham types it to a spoonful
[1:36:12] of ocean
[1:36:15] right
[1:36:16] he says all that's in a spoonful of
[1:36:18] ocean contains all the same qualities
[1:36:20] that all the ocean does
[1:36:23] christ in you is the hope of glory
[1:36:27] now unto him that is able to do
[1:36:29] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:36:32] ask or
[1:36:34] think
[1:36:36] he's able to do abundantly above all
[1:36:43] you hear the numbers that the the
[1:36:45] country the government is talking about
[1:36:47] right now
[1:36:49] uh the trillions of dollars
[1:36:53] there was a time when all of us and and
[1:36:56] still do
[1:36:57] would say boy if i could have a million
[1:37:00] but a million today and today's economy
[1:37:02] is just doesn't have that same value
[1:37:04] anymore
[1:37:07] there's houses now
[1:37:11] they're selling that where
[1:37:13] when i bought it it was 45 000
[1:37:16] 33 years ago
[1:37:19] and houses down the street now are
[1:37:21] selling for 300 000.
[1:37:25] they all do the same thing
[1:37:27] it's a house
[1:37:29] it has a roof
[1:37:30] it's a place to stay
[1:37:33] most of them have less yards most of
[1:37:35] them have there's a lot of things less
[1:37:37] less land with it now
[1:37:39] but the value has increased
[1:37:42] the value of the man has but
[1:37:44] go into houses now that in areas that
[1:37:47] were the desert and they're starting at
[1:37:49] half a million dollars
[1:37:52] and yeah half a million i'm not saying
[1:37:53] half a million dollars isn't a lot of
[1:37:55] money it but the value is different
[1:37:59] look talking about three and a half
[1:38:00] trillion dollars
[1:38:03] for this economy
[1:38:05] to do this to do that
[1:38:08] but god can take with one
[1:38:13] and do more than they could do with
[1:38:15] three and a half trillion
[1:38:17] brother branham says if god could get
[1:38:19] ten men
[1:38:20] who could totally humble themselves and
[1:38:23] give themselves over to god he could
[1:38:25] turn this world upside down amen with
[1:38:27] tim
[1:38:29] because it's not numbers with god
[1:38:32] he could take 300
[1:38:35] with gideon and his men and go against
[1:38:38] an army that was much greater and
[1:38:40] destroy them
[1:38:43] he could take one man with his arms
[1:38:45] raised
[1:38:46] before a whole army and stop them
[1:38:50] and when another man they could say son
[1:38:51] stand still
[1:38:53] what can god do
[1:38:55] he's unlimited he says
[1:38:57] now unto him that is able to do
[1:38:59] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:39:02] ask or thing
[1:39:03] according to the power that worketh in
[1:39:06] us
[1:39:08] paul's recognizing that for himself but
[1:39:10] it's in the scriptures as how you and i
[1:39:12] can recognize it for ourselves
[1:39:16] he is able more than able
[1:39:18] but he lives in me
[1:39:20] so therefore i can speak
[1:39:24] or do we have to wait till god speaks no
[1:39:26] he says i have put these words in your
[1:39:28] mouth i have given you that unction i've
[1:39:30] given you permission you say he tell
[1:39:31] brother branham speak to the mountain
[1:39:34] speak to the storm
[1:39:36] and too many to i uh brother the other
[1:39:39] day and he's a fine young brother just
[1:39:41] began a pastoring a church and
[1:39:43] they had been raised up in a way that
[1:39:46] the pastor he was raised under only he
[1:39:48] was the only brother that was writing
[1:39:50] this whole message everybody else was
[1:39:51] wrong
[1:39:52] so they were not allowed to listen to
[1:39:54] anybody else or anything well they've
[1:39:55] branched out they started a church on
[1:39:57] their own and he's been getting other
[1:39:59] ministers they've been
[1:40:01] they had mentioned to me that their
[1:40:02] pastor had told him to go ahead and
[1:40:03] start youtubing listening to other
[1:40:05] brothers
[1:40:06] and i said well that's good he goes well
[1:40:08] he told us that so that we could see how
[1:40:09] wrong everybody else was
[1:40:11] i said my he said but kind of backfired
[1:40:14] because the brother started hearing some
[1:40:16] brothers preaching the same thing but
[1:40:17] with the right spirit
[1:40:18] and saw the effectiveness of it
[1:40:22] two people can say no to you but the
[1:40:23] spirit behind one know can be totally
[1:40:25] different than the spirit behind the
[1:40:25] other no
[1:40:27] it has a different effect
[1:40:29] so he was telling he says have you ever
[1:40:31] heard brother green's testimony
[1:40:34] yeah i think so
[1:40:36] he had never heard it before because all
[1:40:38] he'd ever heard was how bad for the
[1:40:39] green was
[1:40:40] how long brother green was
[1:40:42] and he goes what a testimony that god
[1:40:44] would literally drive the car down from
[1:40:45] flagstaff down the mountain for him
[1:40:49] why he's still the same yesterday today
[1:40:50] and forever
[1:40:52] he doesn't change
[1:40:54] and to see what god does today
[1:40:59] but you have to be able to see it in
[1:41:00] your own life
[1:41:01] you have to be able to walk with god for
[1:41:03] yourself you have to be able to stand
[1:41:05] like the three hebrew young men
[1:41:09] i will go i will not bow down to that
[1:41:12] and i will cast myself in the furnace
[1:41:14] knowing that he can
[1:41:16] deliver but even if he doesn't choose to
[1:41:18] deliver i'm still not going to
[1:41:21] daniel you cannot pray and he said watch
[1:41:23] me i'll pray three times
[1:41:26] take a stand because you know god for
[1:41:29] yourself
[1:41:30] because you've experienced him for
[1:41:32] yourself and if it's you and god you're
[1:41:35] a majority
[1:41:38] and that has to come as a revelation you
[1:41:40] have to realize who you are
[1:41:42] you are a child of god oh yes so yes i'm
[1:41:45] a child of the king
[1:41:49] but again just going back you realize
[1:41:51] when you transferred when you said i
[1:41:54] accept your forgiveness
[1:41:56] you'll take all this filth and agree on
[1:41:58] me and you've placed your your hands
[1:42:01] on that sacrifice
[1:42:02] and he takes upon himself
[1:42:06] what you were
[1:42:08] but you have to realize then he gives
[1:42:09] you what he is and you are
[1:42:13] and you can't have one without the other
[1:42:16] you cannot have his righteousness
[1:42:18] without the confession of your sins
[1:42:20] and if you have the confessing and
[1:42:21] giving up of your sins then you receive
[1:42:23] his righteousness because if you don't
[1:42:25] then have no effect it had here
[1:42:30] you are a daughter a son of god
[1:42:34] and therefore heir of every promise god
[1:42:37] has ever given
[1:42:38] in his word take
[1:42:40] your inheritance
[1:42:43] and read about it
[1:42:44] study it
[1:42:46] read it get to know it see what belongs
[1:42:48] to you
[1:42:52] and you get a lawyer you get these
[1:42:55] uh the people and i know that brother
[1:42:57] peter works with some of this
[1:42:59] as they do i believe copyrights and
[1:43:01] stuff like that all the laws that are
[1:43:04] involved with that and what you have to
[1:43:05] understand when you're doing this but in
[1:43:07] a will
[1:43:09] the lawyers go through to it and they
[1:43:11] begin to look and they begin to tell
[1:43:12] this belongs to you and this belongs to
[1:43:15] you and they break it up
[1:43:18] but remember
[1:43:19] he's jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:43:21] today and forever
[1:43:23] and he doesn't talk to man about what he
[1:43:26] can do for me
[1:43:27] he tells me right here what he can do
[1:43:29] for me
[1:43:30] he takes care of it all
[1:43:34] when when when you hear
[1:43:36] some of the story some of the things
[1:43:38] that people do
[1:43:40] when it comes to the breaking of a will
[1:43:43] the reading of the will
[1:43:45] people who had never been there before
[1:43:46] never gone to church before but there's
[1:43:48] going to be a will written that day
[1:43:49] they're going to come to see if their
[1:43:50] name's there
[1:43:53] you know maybe they haven't seen their
[1:43:54] parents or had anything to do with
[1:43:55] grandpa and grandma but the will is
[1:43:56] going to be read today boy they make a
[1:43:58] special effort to be there that day
[1:44:01] but every service
[1:44:03] the will of god is brought forth
[1:44:05] we should be
[1:44:06] willing to come and say lord i want to
[1:44:08] hear more about what you've done for me
[1:44:11] the musicians would come up this power
[1:44:13] yes
[1:44:16] but i don't know if these words were
[1:44:18] sufficient enough to to get the thought
[1:44:20] across
[1:44:22] of who we are
[1:44:25] we've come we've confessed our sins our
[1:44:28] iniquities all all
[1:44:30] oh my sometimes we could spend an hour
[1:44:32] just trying to pour out how bad we are
[1:44:34] but you just said just for us to do it
[1:44:37] confess
[1:44:39] to place our hands on the sacrifice to
[1:44:41] give our all to
[1:44:42] and you would take it upon yourself
[1:44:46] that goat that the blood was sprinkled
[1:44:48] and went out and and was gone out on his
[1:44:50] own taking it away from the
[1:44:53] from the congregation that was you
[1:44:56] but the innocent life of that goat could
[1:44:58] not return it just carried over for
[1:45:01] another year
[1:45:04] but the life of god returns back
[1:45:08] to dwell to inhabit
[1:45:10] the one who has confessed the one who
[1:45:12] has placed his hands her hands on the
[1:45:14] sacrifice
[1:45:16] and confessed
