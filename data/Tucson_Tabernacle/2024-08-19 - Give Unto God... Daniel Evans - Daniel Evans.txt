I will see [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen I was in the back and as brother Jonathan was singing I was in the back and uh we're seeing an Amazing Grace and he he got to one part of the song and I just I felt the spirit of the Lord come in the room back there and I started raising my hand and I started praising and I started weeping and then I heard the response come from the audience I heard I heard the Applause come from the audience I could tell that the Lord was moving all over the place and it's just such a blessing to see that he's moving in there he's moving out here and he's moving among his people I was I think last Sunday we had a tremendous tremendous day and and I believe that it was because that I think we got something right and and I believe I know what that is and um I want to continue that along um so much so much so that that a brother that uh he had a prophecy that came on his heart brother John back there in a prophecy a a word for the church that came upon his heart and and we know that these things have to be given in order we know that the Bible says that that the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet that means the person that is giving the prophecy or giving the the message in tongues that it doesn't just overtake you and you have to jump up and give it and interrupt the service that's not the way that's not in order but you have control over that and brother John the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he felt that it wasn't the right time to give it because the Holy Spirit was leading but he gave maybe uh maybe brother John one time that you you could tell us but uh it was basically that the Lord was pleased with our worship yes yes and I believe I know why and I'll talk a little bit about that about that today um I want to greet our visitors welcome to to all of you we have a probably a large percentage of our church is gone they're they're at either the Flagstaff meetings or or they're traveling across the country or they're the camp are there there's something so so a lot of a lot of us are gone but then the Lord saw fit to bring a few

become a good friend Michael right here and his wife lose God bless you welcome he's got a he's got a good way about him I I really appreciate he's he's guiding Stephanie and I through these steps of building a house and there's so many moving parts and it's like he tells me the other day he says he says well we need the valves and I said what valves just we just have we just have a bunch of lumber up here and he says not the valves the valves for the sinks and the faucets and all that I was like well don't we put that in at the last he says no but you got to put it in right now so so

seven over here God bless you and and I see a couple that I'm I probably miss but God bless you all and welcome I am I do appreciate I appreciate the Lord Jesus and um if we can stand just just one more time I'd like to I'd like to read just a portion of his word and this is in the Book of Matthew chapter 22 this is our lord Jesus speaking we'll start with verse 19. this is our lord Jesus talking he says show me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny and he said unto them whose is this image in the superscription and they said unto him it's Caesar's then he said unto them render therefore under Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are God's let's bow our heads Heavenly Father I know it's just a short scripture and but Lord It's the words of the son of God we never want to take them lightly father we pray that that you would be with us that your spirit would be with us for the remainder of this service and Lord that wisdom would come forward and father that we would learn more about you word more about you that we would receive correction Lord to help us through our lives in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can take your seeds I want to lay a foundation to what the Lord Jesus is is talking about here so if if you come on Wednesday night or if you stream in you know that there's that there's three different um divisions of Judaism at this time of the Lord Jesus there's the Pharisees there's the Sadducees and then there's the herodians now these Pharisees they're the they're the group they're like the the local pastors that are Out Among the people and and they believe they're a more liberal liberal group they believed in the moving of the spirit they believed in a resurrection they believed in healing of the sick they believed in the gifts and then we have over here we have the Sadducees and they're the temple worshipers they're the ones that work in this Temple and they are kind of the stuck up uh group that they're better than everybody else and and they don't really believe in in any type of uh of really moving of the spirit they don't believe in a resurrection they're they're really a legalistic group and then we have this group that we haven't talked too much about and they're called the herodians now you know from the name that the herodians follow this man's name Herod so what they did is they supported Herod and and going through their lives and in growing up under under the rulership of Rome they laid their support to this leader this Jewish leader named Herod and Herod was in League with the Roman Empire he was kind of hand placed there and Herod Herod was a powerful man a very capable man he built he built great works and and he is the one that was tasked with rebuilding the temple so Herod was a very very important and very powerful man at the time and we see that this group that followed him they were probably a more worldly crowd they were they didn't probably have a lot of deep understanding but they thought some of them thought that maybe this Herod or maybe the next Herod or the next Herod these group of herods maybe that this could be the Messiah because Herod was bringing a peaceful relationship between Rome and Israel so there are some people that thought maybe this Herod could be this Messiah so when we get to this scripture Matthew 22 and we'll start with verse 15. when we get to this scripture we see that that there's these three different groups of people right now we'll be talking about the Pharisees and the herodians and then later on we won't get to that the Sadducees come into play in this same chapter so let's let's start with verse 16 and chapter 22 of the Book of Matthew then went the Pharisees then went to Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk verse 16. and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying Master we know that thou art true and teach us the way of God in truth neither careth thou for any man for thou regard us not the person of men so what they're doing is they're kind of trying to pump up Jesus here they're trying to say oh you're great you know you're you're a man that that you you're not swayed one way or the other with your doctrines and stuff and and they're they're kind of trying to get on his good side what they're doing is they're setting him up for failure but we know somebody that doesn't fail so they're trying to build his trust they're trying to pump them up and now remember these herodians they support Rome so the next question is a loaded question from the herodians tell us therefore what thinketh thou is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not now Jesus they're looking to for something to get him killed and if they could pin him being disrespectful to Caesar in causing an uprising that would be a quick way to get the Roman Empire on your side to kill this man Jesus but Jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites show me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny it wasn't a penny by our standards it was a unit of of currency that it was worth a lot more than a penny so they they brought him this coin and he saith unto them whose is this image in this superscription and they said unto him it's Caesar's so Caesar was printed on this coin then saith he unto them rendered therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are gods and when they heard these words they marveled and left him and they went their way now the scripture is usually used in a way to encourage a Christian to follow the laws of the land to pay your taxes and and to uh to just just to be a good law-abiding citizen which it should be it does it does very plainly say that to give to Render unto Caesars what Caesars to follow the law to pay your taxes don't don't be a bad Christian don't be a bad citizen do those things and then a lot of ministers will take that and also they will apply that and unto God's what's Gods they'll they'll apply that to paying tithes in church and and taking and doing the offering and that which we know that the word tithe basically it just means a tenth and and then we have an offering and that offering is above and beyond your obligation as a as a tithe so it's basically what you want to do and what we're going to start doing here in the church is we're going to be starting to maybe take these offerings and doing projects that we need to like the projects that you know for our youth um in in the other in the annex there and other things like that so much of the time that is what the ministers Minister on but I don't think necessarily this scripture really says that it does say to give unto Caesar what's Caesar's but when it says to give to God what's God it doesn't it's not talking anything about the money it's it's making Jesus is making this broad statement and that statement was so profound that it says that that they were just basically in awe of what he said and then they went their way so when he's saying give unto God what is God what did the Lord mean when he was saying that was he talking about money or was he talking about something else and that's what I that's why I want to talk about this morning is is give unto God the Bible says in second Corinthians chapter 4 that the devil is the God of this evil world and we look and we we are obligated to give and and to follow the laws and that and we should but we have to remember that that this is not God that this is Satan's World Satan is the one that has has said 6 000 years to create this world and now it's just full of sin but yet there is a God there and there is a God that made prom made promises and this man Jesus Christ came to fulfill those promises and to make it to where we are not dependent on this world anymore the God of this world tempts us with every type of sin and each of us are different each of us have weaknesses each of us fail in different ways and I don't think one any more than any other really all of us have failed and come short of the glory of God in all of us are bound for a place called hell without our lord Jesus that's a fact it's a hard thing to say and it's a hard thing to think about but without Christ we will not we won't go you know I think about making a commitment to the Lord and I think I see so much that people will get married and they'll they'll make this commitment to this man or to this woman For Better or For Worse and and as long as things are going good as long as things are are are happy and all is well in the home that they they will they will keep that that commitment but then when things get hard they really quickly forget about the four worst part and that's that's they break that commitment and that's why we see so many problems in our society today we see so many problems in the church is because they enter into these decisions haphazardly not really willing to do what they say and to stay loyal to this person and and to give their life to this person and it ends up in hardship it ends up in suffering for the people for the families God doesn't want us to suffer as I say many times we have to know the reason when God sets these rules for us there's a reason behind them and he's basically saying listen if you enter into this lightly and you divorce this man you're going to have all kinds of problems down the road you're going to get into a lawsuit you're going to have to split everything you're going to hate each other the kids are going to have to split there's all kinds of problems associated it's better to enter into it the first time the right way and to make that commitment I was commitments are important and when we talk about being a Christian we make this commitment to the Lord we go up and we're baptized but that doesn't stop there I made a commitment in like January I was like 217 pounds and I said man I Gotta Lose I got to get down to 205. I got to lose 12 pounds and I made that commitment and I said I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm gonna start dieting and I'm going to I'm going to get down to this 205 which is my that's my fighting weight that's that's the weight that I want to be at so that was that was like six months ago and I weighed myself last night and I was 2 23. a lot of good that commitment did it didn't do anything and we see with with so much with with Christians we we get it we get excited and we want to do it and we want to make that commitment and we make that commitment and then we don't stick with it what good does it do it doesn't do any good and it's the same thing with with a church it's the same thing with the Friendship it's the same thing with the Merit a marriage we make a commitment that is when the work starts it doesn't just stop right there it that's what begins this commitment of being a Christian in Romans chapter 1 verse 20 it says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are that are made even as eternal power in Godhead so that they are without excuse so there's no excuses friends once we once we hear about Christ there aren't and especially in today's world there's no excuses for us not living this life it's been laid out right before us the Lord has has given us this this free gift and he says all you have to do is accept it we make that decision but just like me and my diet man I didn't stick to it it didn't do any good we have to stay that course yes we fail yes we do things wrong but it doesn't end in baptism it doesn't end when you make a vow it continues on it really continues until the day you die constantly constantly seeking the Lord constantly trying to do things that are right but I will tell you once you are filled with that Spirit of Christ once you have that new birth then you are sealed until the day of your Redemption as the Bible says you are sealed there and even though you stray you still are going to come back but when we stray we make it harder on ourselves and we suffer in this life but you're saved you are a child of God you're going to end up there but the decisions that we make just make life harder we were we had a youth camp and there was this young man and he uh he came and he um just didn't have a good attitude so day after day I really reached out to him and I tried to spend some time with him and talk about the Lord and he didn't want anything to do with it his parents made him go he was I don't know 18 years old or so and then at the last day we had a um we had our service and after the service was over people started filing out all the young people I don't know 150 of them or whatever it was 200. they started filing out and then this young man he stayed in his seat and he had his head down so I I stayed and he was the last one there in the church so I went over and I sat next to him and I put my hand on him and and he tells me says I can't do it I said I said okay I said well and we had to move they were they were doing some work in the in the um it was a tent a big a big tent so we had to move into another tent another big uh like a worship tent so we go into that one it's just him and me and and we're talking and he says I I just can't do it he says I can't give up and it was a girl and she was uh she wasn't a a good girl and he knew it and he says I just I can't do it I can't give it up so we continue to talk and and I said I said brother I said we'll just we'll just keep on you know and and um he didn't want to leave he wanted to continue there and pray so so it was I mean time passed and he says he says I I just I can't make that decision and I said okay I'll tell you what I said I said Do You Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he said yes I said then the Bible says that if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ that you're saved and he says he says okay and I said I said do you make that decision he says he says he says yeah he says okay he says maybe I should go get baptized I said well I said that's that's good um if you want to go get baptized and he says he says but I just feel something I said what you feel is not that you want your salvation what you feel is you are Desiring that the Holy Spirit would enter you and that you would receive a new birth in Christ and that you would be a new person I said that is what you are Desiring and he said that's right he says but I can't do it and I said okay I said I'll tell you what I won't tell anybody I said everybody sees us in here we're praying together I said they're all getting baptized I said I won't tell anybody I'll just say that that you gave your heart to the Lord and he said no and I knew he was going to say no I wasn't oh I wasn't I knew what the answer was going to be so we sat there for a little while he was sitting back one day I believe he'll be in this church he was sitting back leaning back in his chair and he leaned forward and he said I'll do it and when he said that this Spirit came in to that tent and it was the most powerful experience to this day that I have ever experienced in my life because he made that decision he said I'll do it and he we walked out we prayed and we walked out of that tent he goes brother Daniel he said look how green the grass is he said look at how beautiful the trees are he said look at how beautiful the sky is and I said yeah brother I said the Holy Spirit feels good doesn't he says he says oh and I felt that I knew that that Holy Spirit came in and filled that young man I knew it I could feel it it was it was beyond there was in no doubt so he goes on and he continues to serve the Lord and I gave him a testimony and I said be careful I said I'm not saying that this young lady that you're with is not the right one you're supposed to be with because I don't know but be careful because she will want to keep you and she will probably say what you want to hear and he said God told me that she's the wrong one I said okay the Lord showed him a scripture I'll be specific he showed him a scripture that Solomon failed because he went with idolater women the Lord showed him that scripture and he said brother Daniel I know time went on he was serving the lord he was doing well and then this girl she says we'll all be I'll do whatever you want I'll I'll start going to church I'll do this and and I know God showed him not me God had already showed him that he was going to make a mistake that that if he if he brought this girl back and then finally he gave in and left the Lord left everything and had his life from that time has been just awful she left him of course she's gone another another woman comes into his life she's gone all of these problems that's that stemmed right from that one decision but let me tell you something it doesn't make him any less of a child of God the holy spirit filled that young man sealed him and he backslid he made a mistake and all of us can make a mistake all of us can do the same thing I am when Jesus said when he said you give unto God what is God's he wasn't talking about your money he wasn't talking about your car he wasn't talking about your job he was talking about every single thing in your life everything you give to God what is God's and if you don't you may still be a child of God you may be sealed with the Holy Spirit but you're gonna have problems you're going to suffer in life because you are his if you're not his then no you won't suffer everything will go on just fine and and and you'll you'll divorce and and and remarry with this one divorce without remember everything will be going great and and you'll you'll be out partying with your friends and everything will be fine and your life will just line up perfectly but there won't be any desire in you to serve God but the real true servant of the Lord you're going to suffer and it is better to suffer here on Earth than it is to suffer at that day of judgment the um let's read let's read another another scripture Luke let's go to Matthew chapter 10. verse 34. Jesus says this he says think not that I am come to send peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword for I am come to set a man at variance against his father and daughter against her mother and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law he says here I require everything if it splits up you and your husband if it splits up you and your kids if it splits up your mom your dad or whatever it must be Christ he is more important than anything and it see I'm always talking about unity and how we should be together and we should love one another which is the case it's all through the Bible and we should but when it comes down to that thing do I make that decision that I choose Christ or I choose this you have to choose Christ it says here and a man's foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me I think about how much I love my kids when they were born and I would have done I would have died a hundred thousand times over for either one of my kids those precious little things and growing up and how how good of a relationship we have and how much of a blessing they've been to me and how much how much love we've had in our family but Jesus required he says if you love them more than you love me you're not worthy of me think about how much we love our family members our children our parents but we should love Christ more than that that and we we can't love him unless we know him I uh for time's sake we'll uh we'll move forward I just on those lines we all sin we all sin and we all come short of the glory of God that's in the Bible and we think that that maybe that well Lord I would give you everything I would do I would do whatever it takes but are we there yet I don't think any of us are there yet and if you think you're there then there's a problem if you don't see your sins if you don't see what you're doing wrong then there's a problem in your life says give unto Caesar those things that are Caesar's but give unto God what is God's and I think that that's hard for us to do every day what if it's if it's not money what if it's if it's not your time what if it's a position in a church what if it's if it's a a relationship with a husband or a wife that that sometimes you have to take the lower place to to avoid a fight which things are more important those things that are gods I gave you an example of last week how I really believe that the Lord blessed us and if you were here everyone felt that Spirit now we had that was really the spirit was here and it was it was like God's doing something and it's something I've been praying and and Lord what is this and I think what it is it's so important in a minute I've talked with a few of you about it is our music in our church and we're and it's how important is that worship how important is that music and and we're moving forward in this direction and we're seeing the Lord start to bless it we need to be careful we don't want to go too far but we're moving I believe and and he came down and he was there with us in a in giving things to Caesar what are Caesars and giving things to God what are God what is God's music is meant for worship and music is a something that can be so deceptive it could be it can come in and slide in and bring in spirits that that will destroy a family they'll destroy your life and it comes in maybe through this music and so many times I've been you know I'm listening I listened to the music on on the radio the Christian music and then and then I'll go in a place and it's like is that Christian or is that not it should be separate there should be a spirit that that's with that and and if we can't tell if it's the world with some of the things that they say or Christian if we just listen for the words there's something wrong So Daniel and I were we were driving and uh we were we were talking and Daniel was talking about some somehow a song came up and and I don't remember I don't have no idea what the song was but Daniel made this statement he said well Dad he said it's a clean song it wasn't that he was listening to it but it was something that that um I forgot what we're talking about but but Daniel's made this statement he said it's a clean song it's like a clean song that's a that's a strange thing to say so it really made me start thinking what does that mean a clean song and and and I know you young people especially there's filth that's that's that is just it's just piped in to us and so I was thinking a clean song so we Daniel and I go in somewhere and the radio's gone and uh I hear this statement that it said take me to church and I was like oh okay you know this is good so I couldn't really hear it and uh I was trying to pick out some words and it was kind of a catchy tune so I was that was on my mind a clean song and then I was listening listening trying to trying to hear because it was just a public place and I couldn't really hear the hear the music so I'm thinking on that and then and I'm thinking that music is such a way to introduce sin not only into our own personal lives but into society as a whole there's a song that if you listen to some of the old some of the sermons you've heard brother Branham talk about this song in the 1920s that made such an impact on society let me read you some of the things that it says it's meant it's by a man named Billy Murray in the 1920s now this is Brother Brahms ERA this is when he grew up listen to this it says this listen girls listen girls I have a word for you because you're up to date and do the things you do don't let anyone tell you that you don't act nice while you're as sweet as grandma was so take my advice and then it goes on to the chorus which is roll them girls roll them go ahead and roll them so what it was back then in the 1920s that they would have the short skirts and then they would have these um pantyhose things and then sorry sis I don't know what they're called yeah and then they would roll them down and this song was about encouraging these young ladies to show off their bodies and to and to present themselves in this way and it says this roll them high or low just as you please don't let people tell you that it's shocking paint your sweeties pictures on your stockings laugh at Ma laugh at Paul give them all the ha ha ha roll them girls roll them roll your own roll them girls go ahead and roll them listen girls listen girls when you bobbed your hair you were criticized a lot but you still didn't care when you shortened your dresses you gave you gave some some shocks but we never thought that soon you'd be wearing socks roll them girls in the winter in the summer spring or fall roll them roll them everybody roll them anywhere anytime or any place at all young girls old girls sweethearts wives mothers young Maids old maids even our grandmothers high or low rain or snow girls must be stylish roll them girls roll your own so we look at that and this was this was a way for to introduce unclean living back then it was a way to introduce that that these women and these men would start acting promiscuous from a dirty old man wanting the women to do that him wanting to see that so so this goes on and we see that we we see the the immorality start to start to come about through the history and we see the sexual Revolution come up we see in the 60s and all of these problems and all of it was just to hurt us like I said we we act in a way we shouldn't and then we just bring problems on us God loves us and you have to understand why that that he doesn't want us to live immorally so then we're in this Place me and Daniel and I'm listening to this song and it says take me to church and I was like oh that's kind of a catchy tune I want to see what this is young people probably know what it is but uh I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you what it is um it says this now this is just one of the verses it says no Masters or Kings when the ritual begins there's no sweet or innocent innocence than our gentle sin in the madness in the soil of that sad Earthly scene only then I am human only then I am clean oh oh amen amen the song as I research it the song is about a homosexual relationship between two men absolute filth and bringing in this into society through music through worship when you are listening to something when you're listening to this music it is worship it is designed to worship God so when we are hearing these these things and we're listening to them it's a catchy tune but we are worshiping given to God what is God's let Caesar keep that so when we're when this this thing starts and being introduced and now we're seeing way back in the 1920s we see that and we see what it ended up with with broken homes and and half of the the people that that get married over half get divorced and and all of these problems and immorality that comes in and now we're seeing another move making fun of Christianity in this in this what this this song is saying saying that there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin filth and bringing this in and then our young people are hearing this and we don't understand they don't understand that this is bringing in problems and it's introducing I see it brothers and sisters I see friends that I love I see that their homes are now being busted up with that type of spirit sin and problems those those kids don't want to do that but they're being pressed by what my dirty old men I believe that's right you know I hear so many times they preach against the women this is because of men filthy dirty men I want to see this in society and I know it I know it's hard to say but it's true it's it's be careful what you listen to be careful how are you worship Daniel sang a song last week and it's friends I like the new songs if God can Inspire someone a hundred years ago he can Inspire someone today it's the same God so I know that we grew up in a certain era and that's the kind of songs that we want to hear and everything else is just wrong no it's just because that's what we like that's what we're used to but these new songs listen to these words in comparison there's a Grace when the Heart Is Under Fire another way when the walls are closing in and when I look at the space between where I used to be and this Reckoning I know I will never be alone there was another in the fire standing next to me he's re this song is written part of it is about those Hebrew children in the fiery furnace that they were there and then there was another one the Son of God protecting them he's standing next to me there was another in the waters holding back the Seas and should I never need reminding of how I've been set free there is a cross that bears the burden where another died for me all my debt left for dead beneath the waters I am no longer a slave to my sin anymore and should I fall in the space between what remains of me and this Reckoning either way I won't bow to the things of this world and I know I will never be alone I can see light in the darkness as the darkness bows to him I can hear the roar in the heavens and the space between where's thin I can feel the ground shake beneath this as the Prison Walls cave in nothing stands between us there is no another name there is no other name but the name of that is Jesus who was and still is and will be all through think about our worship our what what we do before the Lord are we giving our lives to Caesar are we giving our lives to the God of this world or are we giving our lives to Christ are we dedicating everything to him it's a question that we all need to answer give unto God what's God's let me ask you are you God's are you one of God's children then give unto God what is God give your life to God or are you Caesars the God of this evil world would you give your life to him just to build just to build make money and to build and to build some sort of an Empire for yourself so so that you can retire and that you can live easy and do all these things that is giving everything to Caesar what about God we forget him but Jesus here he says and that's why I was so profound he says give the money to Caesar it's his but give to God what is God's and that's what I want to do everything that's in me let me give my life let me give everything to the Lord and and I see that we say well we make mistakes we do these wrong things wrong never Point your finger at anyone else for making a mistake because you are as sinful as anyone else but by the grace of God he has elected you to come into His presence to allow his Spirit to dwell in within you her brother said quoted that scripture I believe is in Revelation about all of these angels around the throne Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands and thousands and thousands a hundred million Angels there circling around this Throne of Jesus and here comes the prophet the prophet Isaiah and here he comes between up to the throne and here is this a hundred million Angels going around and Isaiah comes and he says I am unclean I'm filthy he see he comes in the presence of God I'm I'm terrible and this is a prophet of God so when we feel how bad we are we should feel that way but remember when God looks down upon us he the um a brother sang that song he became me so that I might become him by grace it's we can't become Jesus but when God looks down he doesn't see our sinful ways he doesn't see us he sees the blood of Jesus Christ but we have to make that commitment we have to accept Christ and we have to be careful of all of these things coming in to destroy us you young people the devil is after you let me tell you I promise you he's coming after you and he's coming after you with weapons I mean roll your pantyhose down come on now look at how bad it is that's that little sin that's when I Feel Complete sickening but he's coming after you and let me tell you you got to have your guard up all the time and music is the way that he can get in the um musicians can come brother Jonathan I'm going to have I'm going to have you close the music the musicians can come it says here Colossians 1 16 says all things were created by Him and for him so if we are gods if we are someone that that will give our life to God as Jesus instructed then we understand that that our whole lives are meant to serve Jesus and then don't forget let me let me let me do say this that it makes us happier it protects us everything is better when we do that I want to read well when when I was I was thinking about that and I was I was sitting back in my chair and I was looking at those lyrics to that ungodly song thought Lord that's a human being that wrote that and I was looking at it and and I I said I said Lord I said you could just one finger you could just wipe all this sin away and destroy all of that yet you let it go why I was just I was so I was so upset I was so hurt that this this song was out there and people singing it and then I thought of Isaiah that that the scripture I just referred to I thought about Isaiah and how Isaiah came before the Lord and he was as filthy as that songwriter as anyone else the prophet of God and he said Lord I've looked at you I'm gonna die because I'm a man of unclean lips and I was and I was sitting there I was looking at that song I was like Lord I'm The Sinner I I just Lord I'm I'm the one that's filthy and and I don't ever want to condemn this Lord have mercy on that person have mercy on all of these these people because this is a difficult time imagine Isaiah Millions 100 million angels around those Thrones around that throne and Jesus and he says I Am Lord I am a man of unclean lips [Music] I want to read one more scripture and it's something that think that [Music] how could it doesn't make sense how could how could this scripture be written with all of the sin in the world but Romans chapter 5 verse 8 the Apostle Paul speaking he says but God commendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so as much of a sinner as I am all that all that I've done wrong and maybe there's sin now yet while I lived in sin Christ died for me how much should we love it for that all the way we should give him everything give him give to God what is God's and give to Caesar what Caesar's God deserves it all all of it and you make mistakes we all do it doesn't matter come back from those mistakes but try like my commitment of losing weight it doesn't work until you stay with it amen Amma [Music] one of the first ways that we make that commitment is through baptism in the name of the Lord and if you haven't been baptized this morning would be a good time to be baptized it's it's a commitment that you make that is an outward expression of the Lord doing an inward work and then once you do that then you continue on following God and you have a promise after you're baptized and you young people hope I'm not too hard on the music I don't mean it to condemn in any way I just want to warn you careful with that it's a spirit that comes in and it's a way that the enemy tries to get in and hurt you do we have a baptism [Music] we do Brother Joseph are we good okay brother um brother Arnie if you could if you could take him back or [Music] anybody else brothers and sisters God bless you all when I talk about I really believe that the Lord Brother John I believe the Lord blessed us so much because our worship was acceptable to him and I want to continue on in improving with our worship and our music and put our lord Jesus first in all things give unto God the things that are God's God bless you all I'll uh I'll see you in a few minutes upstairs and I do feel what I'd like to do tonight is um there's a lot of folks missing from our congregation I would like to not necessarily cancel service but what I want to do is I want each of you if you be willing take at least 30 minutes this evening and give unto God those things that are God's take 30 minutes and spend it in prayer this evening and we won't have service here we'll cancel service tonight but we make a commitment we make a commitment to go before the Lord in prayer we do it I think that it'll please him given to God the things that are God's God bless you all brother Jonathan [Music] maybe before uh the pastor moves out last Sunday [Music] as he was ministering here and saw the the laws the brothers and sisters that have left church that need our encouragement and then towards the servant at the end of the service [Music] he kind of say do you have someone in your heart and you want to pray for those people as I was seated there I had three people in my heart I come here [Music] I meet these two people that we are here and they are not here because situations happened in their lives I have met both of them man I have met both of them and when the Pastor said do you have people I raise my hands and I spoke the three names the two names then the third name is this sister seated here because this is the seated here she is the opposite house at the Castro house where I'm staying with brother Silas and she meets with brother n often when we are outside cleaning she walks in the yard so one day she walked to us there and she said can I have brother Ann's number so we start talking to her then she said she has been in this Tabernacle for 10 years she used to be here at this Tabernacle for 10 years with a certain family and that family they are not here they have gone somewhere so last Sunday I had this sister in my heart and those two men and immediately after service I usually remain here for some time just for prayer but that Sunday after the first service I just quickly walked and I went to knock at the sister's house and I said the Lord has spoken to my heart to come and talk to you that you need to go back to church and then she says brother Jonathan I am like this I am like this I said the Pastor said it's not what you are is what he is amen amen and what he has done to you he says look I used to wear this way I used to wear this way now I'm wearing this way I said go back to church so she made a commitment she says okay can I talk to brother Ann so she spoke to brother and she says she's coming Wednesday so Wednesday she was here and the pastor says can you continue coming so after I spoke to her I went in the room and I picked up this phone and I called that man [Music] that man the other man of these two I called a brother elderly brother I want to mention his name but you know him the father is here is listening to me and before I called him I was so much heartbroken and I was in tears I said Lord can I speak to him and I would feel like the Lord says speak to him so I called him I says how are you brother he says oh brother Jonathan how are you I said I'm fine I said are you private he said yes I'm private I said okay I feel that you can come maybe because I don't want to speak this thing on the phone you're an elder person so he says no no just go ahead brother Jonathan it's okay I said I'm from church the message today was that we reach out to our brothers our sisters who have not been here maybe we haven't encouraged them that they should come back to church I know that I have met your father and he has told me this this is what happened this is what happened in your life he said yes brother Jonathan this is what happened this is what happened is what happened I've been so heartbroken and things went this way and I'm this way but I want to tell you that I love the Lord [Music] I am okay right now just continue praying for me I said Thank you so I asked him to pray for me and when he started praying he broke down I broke down and I haven't spoken to the third person and the pasta in closing again he speaks those words so I just wanted to tell you that nothing brings the spirit of the Lord in the church than a sword that's right being said there is no joy that can ever be in the ministry in a local assembly that need to see a sinner we can sing good songs we can be a big church we can be everything but when I saw comes to the Lord then the scripture says there is so much joy in heaven the joy of the Lord is to see people coming from they are weaknesses there there are problems and they are coming to his home let's bow our heads and pray oh two Gods unchanging us oh to goals and changing air things [Music] eternal before [Music] it goes and changing oh to go the change oh to both unchanging us thank you turn [Music] on
