believe Lord I believe all all things are possible Lord I be Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord God bless you all it's good to see each one of you like to read a couple prayer requests um first one sister Cheryl Hall she says continue to pray for me she still having trouble Brea breathing and she says thank you for your prayers sister Cheryl if you're listening we prayed for you over the weekend and I'm holding strong that the Lord Jesus did something and he is going to deliver you sister at your at his perfect time there's um brother Heath called me just a little while ago and he has a unspoken request for his daughter Brea she really she needs a number of things especially a touch from the Lord and then sister Priscilla fryo she called me earlier she's in the hospital right now she says she asked for prayer over her body and she has been diagnosed a year ago with diverticulitis and she's at the hospital Northwest hospital with an infection in her stomach she says I'm on antibiotics right now and praying that I do not have to have surgery in jesus' name also praying the Lord heals me completely of this sickness and helps me get on the road to Better Health thank you my family in Christ oh I love that last statement God bless Sister Sister Priscilla fryo believe the Lord will undertake for her that's all the prayer requests I have if you have a prayer request on your heart tonight make it known to the Lord with an uplifted hand Heavenly Father Lord these requests we bring before you in the name of Jesus Christ and ask father for the healing of those that need healing Lord the financial need for those that need help as far as their finances and paying the bills Lord of course I want to lift up the people in Israel now and father all that's going on there and what they've been finding father I pray for strength upon the Jewish people Lord that you would give wisdom to the [Music] leaders father that that you would that your Holy Spirit would surround your children whatever whatever race they may be father Christian or Jew Lord I pray that you're with them father I pray that you have your way and may your will be done in that place that all eyes are upon right now in Jesus Christ's name amen I have you remain standing for for just a moment um I was thinking about as I see what's going on in Israel I was thinking about time I was there a few years ago and I was sitting there and I was looking at the foundation of the Temple Mount and I was looking at all the giant stones that were pulled down the Big Blocks that were pulled down they were laying down in front of the the um Foundation there for what used to be Solomon's Temple and I was thinking lord I can't believe I'm here and looking up was once a stairwell that went up to get on the Temple Mount I looked at that I said Lord Jesus Christ himself walked up those stairs walked up to this place that I'm at right now and then prophesied that not one stone will be be left upon another and I I looked there and there's all this these piles of stones that happened soon after he prophesied that and as I was sitting there a young man came it was on yam kapor that I was there and a young man came and he sat down next to me and he was studying to be a rabbi and uh he just had a lot of lot on his mind and we started talking and remember I made this statement to him I asked about the Messiah and I asked him some questions and um I asked I told them I said I said brother I said all of these prophecies that are prophesied to take place they will happen I said but you don't have to interpret any of these prophecies the interpretation of a prophecy is the Fulfillment of that prophecy and how many people how many all of us we look at things starting to happen and we start to try to place them into history and we try to interpret the prophecies and all that it is not our place brothers and sisters because you know what we'll be wrong and it's wrong every time how many times have I heard when Russia goes down and gets goes down there to get the oil oh over and over and over every time Russia and oil is mentioned in the same sent there's a prophecy about that you know what it's not up to us to interpret any of this it's us up to us to believe it and to pray and to be in the right place so when these things happen that we are in the right place and on the right side my Bible says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem and that is our role and see some of the things that are happening and and it is prophesied one day that all countries would come against Israel it's going to happen one day the prophet said it and uh I just I pray for the people there that the Lord will give them strength there's a lot going on and uh as I said on Sunday morning it's our alarm clock that we need to wake up and we need to get our lives right with the Lord and we need to witness to as many people as we can to get them in to this body of Jesus Christ because that door it looks like is closing and it's our role not to interpret everything that's going on but it's our role to see it as a sign and as a warning which is what prophecy is for a warning and to get ourselves right and to get get others right so we can all cross the finish line This sermon that we're going to hear tonight is I think brother Brandon preached a sermon one time said why am I so misunderstood this is one of those sermons I really thought it would be good for all of us to hear Brother brandom mentions and he says in the sermon that this is the first time he's told it publicly he mentions a vision that he had and it's a tremendous vision and it's a tremendous prophecy but I've seen as many of you have over and over again this prophecy and this Vision interpreted this way interpreted that way starting a a sect of the message over here and another sect over here and and another one over here and it's as I said friends it is not up to us to interpret what this Prophet said leave the prophesying to the prophets leave the interpretation to God and let us just believe it I pray that it'll be a blessing to you tonight to hear this and I want you to notice as brother Brandon as he gives this prophecy and gives us this Vision then he begins on his sermon and and watch his excitement grow and grow and grow as he gets deeper and talking about the Lord Jesus and how how he he talks about how Jesus can help us and how Jesus does he does everything that we need and you see the prophet he just his excitement grows and grows and grows and it just it shows us his Focus was on one thing and one thing only and that is Christ Jesus in this day and I I thought it would be good did I lose my song leader I thought it would be good to brother you can stay down you can you can stay I thought it would be good to um for us as a body of Believers to hear this tape and to see where it all came from and it's like five minutes and then listen to The Prophet what he puts the emphasis on so let's let's sing only believe and let's remain standing until brother brandom uh stops praying and says amen then we can be seated oh be all the things are possible only believe only be oh be all things are [Music] possible only the sermon is 1956 January 1 why are people so tossed about we will listen to the first hour tonight God bless you here's brother Brandon there to my heart was a blood [Music] of our father we thank thee this morning there is a fountain open in the House of David for un cleansing this and purifying of our hearts and we come humbly this morning to that Fountain that's filled with blood of thy own beloved Son Jesus plunging our souls beneath its Crimson flow to come up on the other side was where we went in Sinners we come out saved going sick come out well going downtrodden dishearten weary tossed about by every little thing and come out on the other side established how we thank thee for this great opportunity this great privilege that we have of coming to thee and today we humbly bow our heads and thank thee for every blessing meet with us today Father here now we thank you for meeting with us in the songs and the former part of the service and now meet with us around the word and may we have faith Fellowship around the word with thee Lord and may the Holy Spirit take every word straight to the heart of the believer and sinner alike and may there come forth a great harvest of help today help for the needy help for the sick and The Afflicted help for the weary and distressed and help for the wayfaring man for the lukewarm believer and encouragement for the one who's in Christ resting filled with the spirit waiting the coming of the Lord grant it father for we ask it in his name the Lord Jesus amen so happy to be in the Tabernacle this morning in a heart good morning to you all trusting that this day has found us still in the service of the Lord when we raised our hands a while ago how many could sing I am so wondrously Sav from sin I was sure so happy it looked like 100% everywhere every handed I could notice was up in the air I am so wly safe from sin Jesus so sweetly abides Within I'm so happy for that today for you and now I believe if Sister here on the stretcher is just a little bit in the sun if she if she want to be moved over maybe I don't know where it's bothering her or not and I noticed her hand also up so wondrously saved from sin Jesus so sweetly abide within oh isn't that marvelous when Jesus of Nazareth can come into our hearts and bless us and make us what we ought to be used to be a little song we used to sing years ago he makes me what I ought to be his grace can cleanse and set me free something like that how marvelous it is now just before we start into teach the Sunday School uh as my lot this morning to come and teach Sunday school and it made me feel good to come in the back door and see him putting the birthday off offerings up here that remind me a long time ago when Tabernacle was first being in its cradle days and just like old times to hear the pastor blessing the people for the coming years of their life and giving thanks for what God had graciously done for them now uh I think I owe to this Tabernacle the the reasons why and to be the first place that I have make this announcement of anywhere yet it's typed out and ready for mail but I think that I would want to quote it being the New Year not that it's New Years but it's the new turn of time I believe we're living in a very uh wonderful glorious day of opportunity when people peoples at this day living to see the Shadows of the coming of the Son of God I I believe with all my heart that the world is going to burst now into the greatest Revival that was ever known or is going into the darkest chaos that's ever been known in history and uh I it's a it's a great time of people to make a decision on what they're going to do and if there happens to be someone here today who hasn't made the decision right for Christ I trust that it'll be this morning somewhere in the service that you in your heart say yes Lord this is the day when I take my make my decision to serve you the rest of my life amen it's a wonderful day I'm sure that over our eyes has been just a veil even believers who we can't see just what's going on around us you see and and many times spiritual Le people are misunderstood and and they don't to the peoples of the world because it's such a strange and an odd life to live a full surrendered life to the Lord Jesus now a few weeks ago I had promised the Lord eight or about 10 years ago when I left in 1946 when I left the Tabernacle that I would serve him with all my heart in these campaigns knowing that it was going to be a great disturbance out there because and a lot of money included and everything like that so I I knew that usually in reading that man who get the Lord bless them just a little bit there's about three major things that usually brings a minister to back to the rut and I noticed from them one of them was money women popularity and those three things I notice in the scriptures that were it money was a prophet balum who sold out his gift to go on account of money when Bic offered so much money many of you acquainted with the story The Samson it was DEA the woman who woed him in her lap until he give away the secrets of the Lord to her and Saul it was popularity he was a prophet the Bible said he was numbered with the prophet and through popularity he wanted to be big and above someone else he fell by this and this is the three major causes that I see in the Bible that cause man to fall and I asked our heavenly father to please sh let me shun at all times those things especially those three major things and kept the covering over them I made a promise promised to God that I would never uh beg for money in the meetings and I made a covenant with him if he ever got to a place where he didn't Supply my needs in the meeting just passing the collection plate which I knew it would take tens of thousands of dollars to do it and great massive meetings and then I I told him that I would leave and come home off of the field this he miraculously did without making one stress at any time for money or press three or four managers lost their jobs because of making a little press for money which I would not permit it I don't believe in it the people around the city here might think well the lord gave us a little home up there that was taken up in one night that uh someone think well he's a multi millionaire I wish you only knew the truth see you no different from that that I could have been that's right but I not even begging but just people come say I'll give you this brother brand but I refuse this I don't want it I want nothing to do with it it's it's filth I I want my inheritance to be above up here and I knowing this the day by day the gray hairs is coming into my head and and I'm not the little boy that I was that started preaching here 23 years ago see and I know one thing that no matter how much you got at this what would have profited a man if he gained the whole world and then lose his soul amen so I've seen that cursed thing the last few days ministers and people calling a different family disasters and things A lady called me the other night she said I won't tell you my name my husband is one a well known healing evangelist on the field and said I caught him right in the act of living in adultery with an 18yearold girl and he he confessed to me that he had been doing it for two years said what shall I do brother brandom and I said lady I don't know I said I pray for my brother his soul and such as that we tried to shun him and he he miraculously met me and helped me until about the last couple meetings and my last meeting in California alone in the last two meetings I went $155,000 in debt that they said you have to beg you have to tell the people they want to be begged I said that's not my promise to God so man said I underwrite it I said that isn't my promise to God so to keep my promise as I would to my fellow man I did to God and I didn't want to tell my wife and boy on the road home come California stop in the Evangelistic Services I said I'll go back I rest up a few days and see what the Lord Jesus says and nothing else I'll come down help brother Neville Pastor the Tabernacle I said I'll I'll do something preach the gospel and go to work like I used to do patrolling on the lines the Public Service Company or something and preach on let him have Sundays uh morning or Sunday night and I'll take the other service and him have Wednesday and I'll have Tuesday or something like that or I said we'll go right ahead with the services and I said I'll get me a job and go to work I did I got me a job brother Woods back there moving hous me so I just went to work got me a job it hurt my wife Billy they said Billy said Dad I'm sure you're doing wrong I said no I'm doing right I keep my promise see I told him I said my promise no matter what it is this a man is not as good as his word I don't want to you can't trust him because he's not no good and so um one thing a person must always be that's honest be tell things so that that you can go back and tell it a million times it'll be the same thing you see just be honest no matter if it's bad or whether it's good be honest and if it's against you say it anyhow or keep still don't say it at all see and so then uh I I feel that that way that God will bless an honest heart and knowing the position that I stand in to defeat sickness and stuff for people in prayer to the Lord Jesus according to his Divine uh word and his uh and his calling that I must be honest in heart to do that because the devil knows whether you are or not he won't pay I don't care how loud you holler how much you make up he won't pay attention to you amen that's right but God will if you're honest so I said I'll tell him when I get to Arizona after left California I didn't have the nerve so I after I said I will in New Mexico and on and on on until I told them come right down here in Indiana well they they understood it pretty well really didn't get it too well he said Daddy I think you're making a mistake but I went home tired weary upset crying went to bed that night and at your wife got to sleep went in the room knelt down said dear Jesus Jesus I don't know what I'm going to do here I am right back where I started from again see I guess I made a failure by two hours the man he appeared to me and he showed me a vision of such a panoramic view of people I never seen I was talking to my wife in The Vision now you people that know me know I'm not a fanatic I don't say these things L they the truth that's right and I I seen it and I seen brother arganbright stand there and I went up to him he said brother Billy said we give out all the prayer cards and everything's ready now for the meeting we got a away take in and out I said thank you brother ARG right I walked toward to some more Brethren and there's another brother preaching I said who's he they said they put him up and I said who's they and they just turned around walked away and the man made just dismissed the audience let them all go and I said oh he shouldn't do that because there is there's no alter call oh he said another fellow spoke up and said we done talk up the offering I said when is the offering more important in Souls before Christ and at that the angel of the Lord taking me out then and he take me to a real bright stream of water the most beautiful blue water and great fish was swimming around them he said I will make you a Fisher and he said Now cast your lure into the water when you do pull it slow first time next time just give it a little jerk not too hard and the next time that's your hook for the catch and I started throw my line in the water I pulled it everybody again to rejoicing and saying that's wonderful that's wonderful I got all excited and jerked it hard on the next one I I pulled a fish and allil out of the water what it was is a little bitty fish and it just about size of the lure and I got my line all tangled up and I straightened out my line and the man which was talking behind me walked around in front of me dressed in Palestinian clothes and a turban on his head he had white robe he said brother Bram that's it I said I know I didn't do right I said I jerked it when I want to he said don't get your line tangled up in these kind of times and I said well I'm running as straight as I can I'll be very careful and he said now the first time I spoke with you you put your hands on the people and told them what was wrong with them and the second pull why when you did you would know the secrets of your hearts and I made you sear before the people but she was always trying to explain it you ought to have done that said you made a public show out of it I said I'm very sorry and he taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent I never seen such a a tent it was packed in line everywhere with people and I walked out to the looked like I was standing above the people looking down where just made an alar call and hundreds and hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior and I look and then I heard a man get up and say call the prayer line and people begin to line up over on this side the left from where I was looking down towards the platform and the line all the way up and down the street for a prayer line I noticed to my left which would have been to my right if I was on the platform a little wooden building and I se that light that all they have the picture of you know it's always in the meeting I've seen that light leave me and go to that building and go in that building and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pool I said why he said well it won't be a public show like the other and I came too and uh now at the beginning of this new year back to my Tabernacle where it started from back to the beginning where I I started I I am very grateful to God for these things and many of you know that just before leaving on the other Crusade of about eight or 10 years I think around 10 years since well nine years it has been it was these things were told exactly how the auditorium Services you remember and exactly how that brother Lawson would live exactly 3 years and then be taken away that brother Ward would build a tabernacle down in this position this direction here and all just exactly you know it's you oldtimers it happen just that way and so will this for it's thus sayith the law and you'll know and now is the believe at the at the brink of the greatest meetings that's ever we've I've ever held for the Lord Jesus's land right in the future beginning now so you know I'd feel very happy this morning to to come before you and this is the first time the message has ever been given out is right here on this through this microphone to the Tabernacle people and now it'll be in the papers the religious papers like L of healing heral is coming and all that in a few days it's already typed and ready to go pray for me and some glorious day when it's all over we'll meet around his thr and what a time we will have and remember it's not just me out there in the service I have such a little part to do with it it's you back here also see and I just believe the little old Tabernacles going

you'll reap the wrong thing you can't go east and West at the same time you're either going one way or the other you're either pointed towards God this morning with all you got looking to him or you're point of the other way you think sometime you're going right when you're going wrong but you can't go to the right and to the left at the same time you got you'll come out if you're headed left you're going left and you'll come out left if you're headed right you'll come out right you can't keep from coming right it may seem like you're going wrong but you're going right follow the compass and the compasses the Holy Spirit the magnetic pole of the north hold that Compass exactly North isn't it wonderful Hallelujah that the electronics of the air I was standing near the North Pole here a few years ago and hear see Northern Lights of sweeping and the yellow green flashes in a dark midnight would make it as light as bu this room to walk by I thought we Down Yonder in Central America anywhere that compos will point right straight to that magnetic home amen it'll guide you North every time and how glorious that is that we got a magnetic system in Glory Hallelujah and every man that has been made a compass to guide through this life or Point towards Jesus Christ just as certain as we're setting in the church today in His Marvelous word now the 19th Chapter or oh I beg your pardon it's the the 10th chapter of Hebrews and the 19th verse verse I want you to listen close as we read having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus How Wonderful by a New and Living Way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say through his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart and with full Assurance of Faith having our conscience sprinkled from Evil and our bodies washed with pure water may the Lord Jesus just grant this answering to the word you like the word faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God now just for the teaching service now for perhaps the next 30 to 40 minutes let's go right straight into the word now our faith cannot rest upon nothing a Christian has to have his faith has to have a solid resting place you know that and the only resting place that a Christian a true born Christian can rest his faith or hers is up on the unmovable word of God it isn't built upon the shifting Sands of man's Theology and and doctrines and upon some church affiliation but a True Believer his faith is rest Solly un un shifting as he approaches the word of God I was saying somewhere maybe here a few nights ago I wanted to preach so bad I preached to my wife in bed till 12:00 just telling her of how glorious Jesus was a text come in my heart it kept burning me so great till I just couldn't rest with it now I just said honey I want to preach to you a little while amen she roused up by Grace she listened I said the Christian faith is based Solly up on rest right a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a Christian rests amen it's all over all finished for the believer at calary right oh sickness May Cal and disappointments but the Christians that rest knowing this that God's able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ amen we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she wants to the Anchor hold I come by a heart Harbor one time and seen that was flying in the plane is great coming down low there's a big old ship there the sails that been let down you know and oh what a storm on the sea my she was talking and I seen that Old Ship sitting there rocking back and forth in some ways that would go in and some ways it would go under and everything I said wonder why that is and the F setting said it's got a sea anchor on it therefore said the ship can't sink said it can go through through the wave but it can't sink that because it's anchored all praise be to God we got an anchor some ways we can go over some we go under but regardless if the anchor holds it isn't the ship doing the holding it's the anchor doing the holding amen it isn't what I am or what I will be or what I was it's what he is now and what he did for me and you amen it ain't what I can do it's what he has done my faith doesn't anchor in what the coming meetings will be my faith doesn't rest in only any ability that I would have or upon what church I should jarn or what people I should associate with my faith anchors and rest entirely upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ all already been received God Justified him for raising from the dead this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and God raised him up from the dead for our justification no wonder the poet said living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away Rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh Glorious Day the Christian rests in that that hope upon the stormy sea there'll sure storms rise all kinds of troubles but we're anchored that's all it'll never sink it can't sink now I've noticed many Christians in my life to be up and down I've wondered about that and without preaching such a text as this out in the other churches to where I go I thought best to deliver it to my people here at the Tabernacle upon why are people so tossed about you find them people who seem to be very religious seems to have such a deep desire and daily they search and hunt and seek for God and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled are Anchored In Christ and this I have learned to be in experience that it is people of intellectuals now speaking this there is two different types of Christianity seems strange but I would not say two different types I say two different phases would be a better word to use not two types two phases the same Christianity but two two phases of it and one of them is an intellectual or a mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart amen the one intellectually is a hunger he he's feasting on God but his his Feast doesn't hold out the other one seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be no trials no storms bothers them at all but they seem to have something about them that people who are Christians and trying to live for God admire that type of Christian and I've often wondered Lord what is it that these people has that others crave so much for and yet seem to fail to get it and I know that's a great question in all of our hearts who have served Christ and I've never seen a person yet that ever once come to him except they afterwards they life never seemed right to them anymore if they ever left Christ I was speaking yesterday to a little man who told me of a minister walking back and tearing up his preaching papers and throwed him into the trash box and said I'm through with it and the following Sunday got a case of beer and sat in the place and drank it couple of weeks after that Lay Dying on the bed if I had time I'd explain that how that works in the Bible but that'd be all of the text but that's another subject how that Satan come in and took the person God had to take his child home that's all all could happen but now to see this hungering for people and yet not able to reach it and many of our teachers and schools has brought in much Theology of telling the people well it's because you didn't shout because you didn't speak with tongues or because you didn't have these kind of gifts which I have nothing in part or to say against such things but allog together you find these people when they do shout or speak with tongues or some other emotion they still don't seem to be the person that they should be now we have know that to be true and I've often wondered myself just what could be done in that kind of a state of mind for the person so finding it so simple in the word of God we are try to explain it in order now to do this after seeing the intellectual part of the mind and the Soul which is in the heart now you truly have two different mental faculties you have one of them that's in your head by your brain and the other is operated in your heart which is called your soul your spirit and your soul now they are very much in disagreement many times when the head seems to say something the soul wonders at it if it's not right but when it comes into the soul the head seems to step back there's been things that's happened to you that you knew was going to be yet you could not explain why and there's no reason you couldn't explain it out but yet you just accepted it and it happened just that way that's when something happens down here in the great meetings of the vast fields of the campaigns I've noticed many people coming to me and saying oh I have all faith brother brand and interally they are right here but in their hearts it isn't there if it was they wouldn't be on the platform to be prayed for for a help of faith if they had Faith now we'll have to go back and get a type to bring this picture out to you this morning as children and I want you to notice closely I believe and tiing especially to to people it's uh it's easier for them to understand to illustrate it it's good to teach children and we're all children amen we we're just Adolescence in God who would here like to say I'm an adult grown up in God all we are not we're just just little babies in God that's right now we want to try to get this to a place where we can see exactly what God is doing so let's go back now to the Old Testament to get a view of this and we'll take it by the children of Israel when they were crossing the the Red Sea and come over into the promised land God by Sovereign Grace each night rained down Mana Out of Heaven and the peoples would go and eat take this mana and make it into bread or cakes or something and would eat this bread which sustained their life in the journey and we find out that many times if they left the Mana lay just a little too long on the ground it would uh it would melt run away just like uh Frost or something on the ground it it didn't hold now we see that that same thing is happening in Christianity many people before 9:00 get hungry you have a lot of Campground uh what would I say Campground Stars many people go to the service and rejoice and shout and praise the Lord while the SP of God is falling all condemnation left their heart and as soon as a day or two add to the reviv they find themselves back in that old grind again yet they're eating Mana many people come to Christ which has never been able in the Pentecostal world to make the Pentecostal people see this fundamental truth it's so hard because each church has its Doctrine and they hear their Pastor daily and evangelist speak something they say oh well I got it that what difference does it make but they fail to get this truth now I've often spoke and do yet and believe this great faith or fundamental truth that Jesus Christ said he that heareth my word amen and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life Hallelujah and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto life you see it he that Hearth my word oh I wished I could sink it into every heart St John 5:24 he that Hearth my word and and believe us on him that sent me have eternal everlasting life and shall never come into judgment but already passing death un life that's his word what do you have to do believe here Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word and believing and applying and resting you see it the word says so hear it your heart says so believe it and your whole being rest in it it's finished heith cometh by hearing Jesus said the word he Hearth my words believeth on him and sent me half Eternal never ending oh always existing life isn't it marvelous every existing life and shall never perish but has already passed from Death unto life has PR passed from separation onto Everlasting presence amen already when he was an alien from God you've ceased from being an alien now you're a child from Death unto life from Darkness unto days from Mortal to Immortal from corruption to uh incorruption from weary unto Joy from Death unto life and resting fully upon thus sayith the Lord not upon feelings mental emotions [Music] Theory upon some unknown something that somebody has said to you that has no basis upon someone say when you come join our church it'll be finished but upon on the word of God the human soul rest solid God said so that settles it makes it real now let's go quickly to the Second Step what makes these people go out on the ground and eat the [Music] banner and then before night come many of them got hungry and people go to the meeting there's just many people who goes and turns the radio on and Hears A good sermon and rejoices many of them goes to church and they hear a good sermon and they go home and rejoice but what is that thing then that comes in and takes it all away from you the first little difficult that rises truly if you're hearing the word and your soul is rejoicing in the word it's the holy spirit that you're [Music] eating see I believe that you believe onto everlasting life I believe that that you acceptance of the Lord Jesus gives you Everlasting eternal life when you believe it then I Believe by one Spirit then you're baptized into the the body of Believers we're going to get to it in a few minutes of God will you believe unto life he Paul said pass into the upper coast of Ephesus finding certain disciples he said have you received the Holy Spirit since you have believed see your faith anchors you in Christ that's intellectual you believe it you accept it you say that it's right you recognize it to be the truth and you're a Christian and you've got everlasting life by believing it you've entered to God you're on the campground man is are falling and you're eating it and did you notice the strange thing that was a mixed multitude eatting the same manner people who are sinners who does not accept the Lord Jesus can still enjoy the seeing the moving of the miracle of God Healing The Sick can rejoice in people doing right can open their hearts and rejoice in a sermon that's preached under the anointing and that's the same type of man that the Christian is eating you see it then you always remember my Doctrine here at the Tabernacle you have to follow God and trees because he's perfected in it now we wonder why and then we find out that this Mana would vanish it would come on the ground then vanish and come again and vanish every day some of it at 9:00 they were gone I met people who' stand in the church and just rejoice and see them go outside the church and maybe Monday or Tuesday one just living un behaving becoming to a Christian and the man or woman whoever it may be return again and shake your hand and say I don't want to do those things you feel sorry for them you seen people accept Divine Healing and say oh yes I see it it's in the word oh thank you Lord I believe it and they'll go all right for a few days and the first little storm Strikes Back To Go Again you've noticed it and it's true and the people can't help it so what's it all about what causes these things to happen now let's notice now we notice that this manner when it fell God sending it down to provide life for the children of Israel in their Journey then God told Moses and Aon to go make a great golden pots and to fill it full of of uh mana and to put it in the Holy place or the holiest of holy places by the ark this Mana was to be set by the ark and there it never failed it never got old it never lost its sweetness it was always good inside there did you you ever meet a person that's been in there and is tasted and living on this Mana you can meet him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday or Sunday cloudy day Bright Day gloomy day things going right wrong he's always sweet always full of love never to talk or do anything wrong he's living under the glory of God he never gets hungry he never has to go to church to get buil up he he's just always full of God people go to church and they'll shake their hand in church and laugh and call your brother outside the church they pull a little business deal that wouldn't be just exactly straight for personal gain I don't say that people are here in a tabernacle but I say there is there's things that people would do and they get different a least little thing or bring that old Tipper back again that's selfishness open up an ear to hear gossip or do something of that type that person has never entered into this poot in here they're outside there're truly eating the same kind of [Music] matter they've been brought into the camp and there's where in the camp of the field is where the people got the Mana and they're in there and that Mana that they eat is the same Mana this man eats here they both have the same pasture they both read the same Bible but one constantly stays true and humble and the other guys ups and downs are going like this is in and out both of them eat the same man but one has entered in and the other is still out both of them are believers under eternal life but one is baptized with the Holy Spirit in the kingdom of God and the other is outside eating the same mana and the people has been telling us that you have to shout to get in here you have to speak with tongues to get in here you have to do all all these things but we find out that those things don't work I see people shout that wasn't I don't hardly think I have no way of judging you shouldn't I've seen people shouting that Liv any kind of aive I've seen people dance in the spirit up and down their halls and come back out and living horrible I've seen both men and women do that I've seen men men and women dance in the spirit and speak with tongues and Shout that had a temper like I don't know why there's something wrong and yet they enjoy the blessings of God they believe in him they have faith in him but it's only in this outer Court it never has come to the inner Court they've never got from here down here amen that's what's the matter with the the the churches today I hope you see it oh my when I can see a preview of it it makes me Rejoice seeing that our anchor holds within the veil the Bible said he that overcometh will I give a white stone and a new name that no one knows but he himself don't make any differ what people say you know yourself when you've been brought into the inner Veil no one could tell you any different not because you join church because you did this or that but something just tells you you got a stone amen that's in the heart not a hard Stone a soft one this Stone makes your heart soft instead of hard in Ezekiel in old times when the laws were put into the Tabernacle in the ark the laws of God Ezekiel spoke of another time now the people there's two classes of people today them same crisis that's trying to do something to say themselves each one says I'll go to church every Sunday that's very good I want to be religious that's very good that's still under the law but when the other by going to church and being good is not something that you do yourself it's something in you doing it for you the holy spirit in your heart now I notice in this intercourse these people that live inside here seem to have always Fed Up always feeling good Ezekiel said I will write my laws a new and put it in their hearts amen for the law used to be on stones in the ark and the Ark represents the heart that I will put my new law in their hearts in the ark the heart is the Abode of God and in the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory over the earth and the heart is the ark God dwells not in the head in the heart God's not known by theology God's not KNN by mental conception God's known by an oldfashioned stifi Born Again experience that's in the human heartall yet men and women live a good life and love God by mental conceptions but the real hiding places in the heart hid with Christ and when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your temperament and he's living his own life to his own will through you Hallelujah no that sounds awful but it's right Christ so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kind of words he' speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting what a beautiful picture of a consec Christ working through Paul say to me to live is Christ and the die gain not me that liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in me Christ Living in the individual soul surrendered Christ speaks through the lips and thans through the Mind sees through the eye acts through the temperaments Hallelujah and the things of the world has passed away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time oh Hallelujah Christ has got control amen you see it that's what it is it's Christ in you Christ in you you say well you see you say I believe that to be the truth brother that's right it's in here but it has it come here if it is then your whole makeup is Christ your attitude your desires your appetite your everything is Christ yielded Rusty everything perfect no matter how dull it looks and how black it looks still it's the same Christ is in you he speaks to The Sinner in the voice that he would speak to him he speaks to the prostitute in the voice that he would speak to the man he thinks to your mouth and the Very pul and he speaks to your heart the very way that he would if he was your on Earth and you are no more your own but you're surrendered hallu into this holy Place Aaron went once a year the congregation watched him he was dressed right he had to be anointed right he had to walk right bled be the LA dressed right walked right anointed right he had Bell and a pomegranate on His Garment and as he walked they pred holy holy holy unto the Lord he taken before him a charger of blood the blood of the Lamb the blood of the at and he was anointed with the rose of Sharon and anointing wor off his beards plumbed to the H of his Curt and he was walking into the inner courts in the presence of God and when he went behind there the fail fell behind him and he was sh he was hid from the outer World praise be to God there is a hiding place Abiding Place hallu and we can walk in the presence of God and be his from the things of this world you don't hear it no more it's soundproof Hallelujah soundproof worlds on the outside gasping and looking but you're on the inside in the presence of the Eternal everlasting God eating from this man that will last for SPS of years hundreds of years it never contaminated neither did it give out and a man that once walks into God and the veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he's in the presence of God eating the Mana no wonder 12:00 9:00 anything he's living in the presence of the king Hallelujah hey no wonder everyday f for see look where he's at he's found the secret place he's went behind the veil the doors is closed behind he don't see nothing of the world B Doors is made sound Fruit by sheep skin and goat skin and this is made sound Fruit by the baptism of the holy spirit that hides a man and Christ there he becomes a new creature and he walks daily before him in this man I have a feeling that we all got something really special tonight did you see yourself in this message did you see how Lord I can improve here and Lord I've made mistakes there did you see that I know I did I I highlighted probably half the message so I couldn't read you a quote the whole thing was just wonderful to me I it it just blessed me that brother brandom was I'll tell you I could preach up here all day but I could never speak like him he he was a special anointed brother that was sent he had a role that was greater I think than any of us could ever be it was a role to really to change the world and you can feel as he's preaching you can feel the love that he has in his heart and you can feel that the correction that he gives us but it's all done through love I just friends I can't get enough of it I listen to it every day it's part of it's part of my life it's been part of my life since the day I was born and I have a feeling it's going to be the part of my life until the day I go to meet my Lord Jesus let's all [Music] stand brother brandom he said your attitude your desires your appetite your everything is Christ yielded resting everything perfect no matter how dull it looks or how black it looks still it's the same Christ in you he speaks to The Sinner in the voice that he would

heart the very way that he would if he was right here on Earth and you are nor more no more your own but your surrendered amen friends when I was talking about prophecy earlier don't get me wrong I very much believe in Prophecy and I know the Lord is prophetic he always has been it's his nature I just want us to always use caution in trying to interpret prophecy just walk your walk with Christ
