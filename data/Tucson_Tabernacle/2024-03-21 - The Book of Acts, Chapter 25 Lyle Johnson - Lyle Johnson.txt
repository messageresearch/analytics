texted me I'm not too long ago I sit on a note that we have this um this little thing where they tore up the the asphalt they're going to repave it and I was just warning the people to go slow when you when you come in the in the parking lot brother Joe sent me a note saying that he said it's just another sign It's Just Another Blessing and that they're going to pave our street out front and give us a nice nice asphalt to drive on no more bumps on the road and I just thought hey man you know brother Joe I was thinking the same thing and I'm just grateful it's a little bit of a hardship now but the the good times coming the good pavement's coming and we might be going through a little hard time right now we might be struggling a little bit right now but there's a good time coming there's a nice smooth road ahead of us and that's a promise for us and a welcome a couple special boys to me Joel and Benjamin you've heard me talk about about my nephews probably quite a bit Joel's the The Boxer that I talk about a lot Benjamin's the guitar player that I also talk about a lot they're they're good boys I just think the world of these kids they're they're like my kids they're my brother Adam's boys so it's good to have you guys here thanks for coming God bless you Sister Carol there you are back there God bless you it's good to have you here too do you feel good being home we're gonna keep you here God bless you it's it's nice to have you um sister Jessica I think you inspired Daniel on that song sister Jessica sang that song at camp and wow it just it was amazing it was just we had an amazing camp if you I think most people were there um I'll share some testimonies in the coming services but I really believe the Lord was with us I believe he paved the way for a nice time and I think he was working on quite a few Souls at camp and I saw that in the last day that couple people I never thought whatever give the hearts to the Lord to be touched made a commitment in their life um it was a blessing um we were sitting around the fire we had some really nice conversations and worship around the campfire and had some of the young people around and I asked him I said what would encourage you so a lot of times we don't have a full house on Wednesday night and Sunday night I said what would encourage you to serve the Lord to to to be excited about the Lord and one of the numer girls said that you know we really appreciate testimonies we really appreciate hearing what the Lord's doing in other people's lives what you didn't know is that I had already scheduled a service um the uh next weekend that we're just going to have a testimony service and that's that's next Sunday I think I told you at the fire that it was this Sunday but I already had it on the schedule and it was already on my heart to do it so when you said that it was it was just confirmation that no this is right let's continue on this way and so next Sunday next Sunday evening be prepared for testimonies and I wanted to go orderly so if you have a testimony to give let's let's keep it short and if you could um contact one of the brothers and we'll put you on a list and I'll just go down the list with testimonies and that also includes song specials too I want to get in some song specials and some testimonies just a nice time of worship I think the Lord would be pleased with it I think he was leading me and you saying that it really it gave me confirmation this is this is the right thing to do I have a testimony I want to share Stephanie and I were we're working late out here wanted to get the the kids room done for the kids I forgot it was a Friday night or a Saturday night sister Debbie when you stopped by it was a Thursday night so Stephanie and I were there and we were working and uh we're here knock at the door and sister Debbie comes in with this little girl sweet little girl her name's Riza she's 11 years old it's her niece she brings her in and and we show around the new area that we had back there and she seemed to like it with all the games and the and everything in there and and I I told her I said you need to come to church you need to come so she came to church and she went um she went to Sunday school and she went to I think she was up in Stephanie's class and she came home she had her book bag and her Bible and all of that and she told sister Debbie she said you know I I didn't I always was afraid of church it was always scary to me she'd never been she thought church was like you see in the movies with these weird old Catholic priests and all these weird spirits and the horror movies she didn't know that church is actually a loving place and a good place so she came to church and she enjoyed it so she couldn't she wanted to come back and she she couldn't have come back for a couple weeks she was busy with her family and sister Debbie said that uh was it uh yesterday or did you say Saturday what day was it they were in the in the wreck it was on Sunday night they were caught they were driving on I-10 and a semi was in front of them and the semi in front of them slammed on the brakes and the dad who is the driver he couldn't stop in time so he slams into the back of the semi somebody somebody behind them slams into them the car starts spinning around on the highway and comes to a stop and and of course the EMS come and the Wreckers are there and they give them a ride to the uh to a nearby service station and sister Debbie drove up to pick him up and of course everyone was telling them how dangerous of a situation that was and no one got hurt and the only real damage to the car was was the right front wheel got bent and they couldn't drive it so sister Debbie comes in and she tells Risa her niece who knew nothing about the Lord friends nothing she'd never been to church she she had never there was no background there at all and she tells Risa she says the Lord God protected you and Riza says I know she says when we got after the wreck when we got here she says I went into the bathroom and I prayed I thought oh Lord how sweet that's why we're here we're here not to get to somebody to believe like us or get somebody converted or fill up a church we're here to get people to Christ and sister Debbie it didn't you got the little girl to where she loves the Lord she's going to start coming to church she she enjoyed it she saw all the people that were so sweet and nice and they loved her and she just she wants to come back I thought praise God thank thank the Lord for kindness and love because that will win over every time that little girl she'll know the Lord Jesus and I believe with all my heart because of how the Lord is using you sister Debbie and using this church she's going to be with us at an eternal camp where we will be all together and everything will be good and we'll be praising the Lord and and sister Jessica will be singing and and Daniel will be playing and and we'll just we'll just have a great time forever and there'll be people there that you may not have ever known just like this Native American man that brother Aaron was talking about there'll be people like him there and they have come because of our witness and our testimony is what the word tells us so let's all stand wow brother Lyle makes ready think about this book of Acts and I think about this next chapter in Paul's again on trial and just getting beat down and and everything everything is just constantly against this man and as I was praying today I was thinking about Paul and I was thinking about how much he relied on God for everything he relied on the Lord and and as he went as he came before these rulers replace Pontius Pilate these people they had the power to crucify him they had the power to cut his head off and he would not he was obedient to that heavenly vision we're going to hear today about how Paul stood and he stood on trial again and he wouldn't back down he loved the Lord and he had had an experience sister Debbie I want a little risen to have that same experience I want us all to have that same experience to where it is just perfectly real and there is no way we could ever forsake it it is Jesus Christ we can testify Jesus Christ how do you know him because he lives right here and and he speaks through me and he uses me he provides for me and I am like that Apostle Paul I am like that Apostle Peter I'm like Mary Magdalene I'm like Mary of Bethany I am like these people because I know the same Jesus Christ that they knew amen and that's what happened to these people in the book of Acts brother and you have a song for we'll just continue whole thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me oh as he made you home thank you Lord for giving to me so great our Salvation so rich I am so free amen thank you thank you good evening let me try that again good evening tonight we're going to study chapter 25 in the book of Acts I I will keep you less than two hours tonight in fact I'll probably keep you less than 45 minutes but that's okay in it Paul prepares for a third trial this one this time is before a new governor once again the person judging seems focused on political expediency rather than application of Justice based on law but before we open our Bibles to read this account let's approach the author once more in prayer Lord Jesus it is such a privilege that we can gather together with people of like Precious faith your spirit here Lord these songs of worship thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me whole thank you Lord for giving to me so great of Salvation so rich yet so free Lord please be with us continue to be with us this evening Lord help the words that are spoken over this desk tonight Lord to be accurate and true and to be of help Lord that your spirit could speak and meet the expectations of each one that's here each one that might be streaming Lord It's Your word Lord and we just want to enter and we want your spirit to just enter in and Lord we just want to be lost in you tonight we thank you forgive us where we fall short we commit this service once again into your hands in Jesus precious name amen we recall from chapter 21 that Paul arrived in Jerusalem and agreed at the repressor of James and Elders heir to participate in an end of vow ceremony at the temple with four Jewish Christians before that could be completed he was recognized by some Pilgrims from Ephesus and Jerusalem for the Feast of Weeks what we call Pentecost and they stirred up the crowd and there was a riot that followed and Paul was arrested chapter 22 as he was being led into the Fortress he addressed the crowd they listened to him until he said that he was sent to the Gentiles and then they erupted this man should not live Paul was then bound and being prepared to be beaten beat the truth out of him tortured for a confession what they called being examined and he told his interrogators he was a Roman he was exempt from such practices he'd had quite enough physical abuse in chapter 23 the next morning he was brought to the Sanhedrin Council and broke him to a fist fight over differences that they had in interpretations of scripture a plan to Ambush Paul was foiled when the Roman Commander Claudius Licia snuck Paul out of Jerusalem that night with a little tiny guard of only 470 soldiers to take him to caesarea to stand trial chapter 24 Paul confronted his accusers in caesarea before the governor Felix only about 12 days it elapsed from when he'd arrived in Jerusalem until he was standing in front of Felix let's read this closing verses of chapter 24 to set the stage for chapter 25. this works better Lyle if you turn it on technology okay acts 24 verse 22 and when Felix he was the governor of the district and also the judge at Paul's trial heard these things Paul's defense against the charges brought by the Jerusalem Council Felix we're told having a more perfect knowledge of Christianity of that way he deferred them he adjourned the proceeding and said oh when Lycia is the chief Captain shall come down I'll know the utter most of your matter I'll decide your case later of course there's no record that lycius ever came and Felix commanded a centurion that's a relatively low ranking military officer in charge of 60 to 100 soldiers to keep Paul in custody but to let him have some limited Liberty and that that Roman officer should forbid menopause acquaintance of his friends to come and minister or come unto him we'll talk more about one of these friends when we get to acts 27 but we're in 25 tonight and after some days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla which was a Jewish in fact she was a daughter of Herod Agrippa he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ and as Paul reasoned of righteousness Temperance that's self-control and judgment to come Felix trembled and answered or go thy way for this time when I have a convenience season I'll call for you Felix was afraid afraid of the consequences of his life under Paul's Ministries he understood that so Felix also hope that money should be given him of Paul that he might lose him wherefore he sent from the oftener and communed with him Felix was corrupt that's all there is to it it's all too common throughout human history he wanted a bribe to release Paul but after two years Perseus Festus came into Felix room in other words Festus became the governor and Felix was no longer the governor and Felix willing to show the Jews a pleasure to gain favor left Paul bound there's a lot going on in this verse 27 we'll investigate some of that this evening as it applies to chapter 25 but you're tired now so please be seated we see Paul's been kept in custody for two years Felix refuses to release him or to condemn him Paul's life is on hold there's no formal charges or Lodge so no one can prove him guilty and he can't prove his innocence now as you'll probably expect from me by now I want to read from a totally different place in the Bible let's pick up the story of Paul from Genesis chapter 40. it's a good place to start Genesis and verse 23 . here a fellow named Joseph is in prison he had interpreted the dreams of a baker and a butler and those dreams came to pass exactly as he told them it would he asked the butler to remember him not the baker because the baker was going to die and bring his situation to the attention of pharaoh not unlike Paul appealing his case to Caesar let's read Genesis 40 starting at verse 23. yet did not the chief Butler remember Joseph but forgot him and the very next verse is Genesis 41 verse 1. it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river I once heard an amazing sermon from this portion of the Book of Genesis this part right here between 40 23 and 41 1. as you can see there's only a blank space but in that blank space two important years elapsed while Joseph was unjustly held in prison some of his experiences in that blank space would help shape his ability to be the number two person in Egypt maybe someday we'll have a chance to show what happened in that blank space well here in Acts some 1945 years after Joseph was released from prison we again read of 2 silence a blank space also during an unjust imprisonment I'd like to make an observation here lack of evidence of activity is not evidence of a lack of activity let me repeat that lack of evidence of activity is not evidence of a lack of activity Luke's account of Acts contains only highlights in the early Ministry of Peter and then some highlights and the ministry of Paul the end of Acts 24 that we just read is in 60 A.D that's about 30 years after the day of Pentecost recorded in Acts 2. you can be sure there were a large number of evangelists spreading the gospel Peter Silas Timothy Apollos Barnabas many others whose names we don't know were active Peter didn't retire after he brought the gospel to Cornelius Paul was busy in Corinth during his first 18-month stay as well as his later three months day little details recorded at that time or of his activity in Ephesus which spans some three years Philip and cesarea wasn't known as the Evangelist because he stayed home once he arrived there after baptizing the Ethiopian treasurer what about James the Jerusalem Church didn't number in the many thousands because the apostles stopped their Witness remember at the first wave of persecution many if not most fled Jerusalem we read when we studied acts 8 verse 1. Saul that's Paul was consenting unto Stephen's death and at that time there was a minor insignificant no a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and a few fled the city no act says they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles Peter and James and others of the original disciples of Jesus this verse tells us a large portion of the thousands of converts recorded on the day of Pentecost and shortly thereafter fled Jerusalem what remained was the core of the Apostles the church body had to be rebuilt new converts added certainly some would have returned after the persecution settled down but it's safe to say that James and Peter and the others continued their witness and their Ministry looking Beyond Jerusalem what about Priscilla and Akila what about the church in Antioch what about the churches throughout Asia and Europe and what we call the Middle East that Paul and Barnabas and Silas and others founded Philippi thessalonica Berea Corinth Ephesus the church didn't die congregations didn't collapse Luke's narrative the book of Acts is narrowly focused it's not a broad record of all activity it's called The Acts of the Apostles but it could be called some of the acts of a few of the Apostles over many decades not all the acts of every apostle back to Genesis I I'm sure Joseph wondered why he would in the prison beneath Potiphar's house at the end of Genesis 40. but he didn't spend his time bemoaning his fate he continued his life he continued serving in that prison and was being prepared for the transformation that would occur in Genesis 41. and here in Acts this Saint Paul had been released from prison by an earthquake in Philippi right the earthquake came he witnessed to the Jailer it was in prison for a day this time it's been two years there's no earthquake Peter had twice been set free by angels from confinement in Jerusalem for Paul there'd be no angel to Spring him from caesarea in the past he'd born physical suffering and deprivation for his witness to the gospel he hadn't been confined for any length of time prior to this incarceration frankly I I wish personally that the ax account told us why the other Christians didn't just pay the bribe and set Paul free maybe they tried maybe Felix was too greedy maybe Paul said no we don't know and therefore we can't judge what we do know as we saw in Acts 24 was that Paul used his opportunities to witness to Felix he didn't give up he didn't wallow himself pity though I'm sure he earnestly prayed to be set free and I'm sure many others were praying for him to be set free and I'm also sure that there were some detractors that said uh Paul you know he was told by many in the spirit he shouldn't go to Jerusalem did he listen no not stubborn Iron Will Paul now look at him Paul would later write that he learned to be content and whatsoever State he found himself when we encounter dry places blank spaces in our lives isolation prayers that seemingly are unanswered the spirit sometimes seems far away we must continue to be what he has called us to be it isn't about our circumstances it isn't about our comfort it isn't about what we feel it's about faith continuing to believe it's about him and his often mysterious will being worked out in our lives it's about being a Christian in the blank spaces Paul wrote to the Romans shortly before his imprisonment in caesarea in Romans 8 14 he said for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Solomon wrote something a little similar proverbs 3. heard this many times I'm sure trust in the Lord with all fine heart lean not unto thy knowing understanding that sometimes is pretty hard in all thy ways acknowledge Him and he shall Direct bypass whenever I read this Heather and I we can't help but here brother red certel's voice when he read this passage in Proverbs as he minister to us in his living room in gizborne New Zealand more than 50 years ago he he brought it to life for us in those dark in those dry places continue to seek the Lord and trust the Lord be like job never give up or back to acts let's see where were we 24 27 to me this is this is like chapter 25 verse 0 just before verse one it says but after two years forecast Festus came into Felix room Festus became Governor replacing Felix and Felix willing to show the Jews of pleasure left Paul found have you ever read acts 24 verse 27 and wondered what was going on behind the scenes why was Felix being replaced with Festus is that the normal order of events why was Felix so intent on showing the Jews a pleasure that he was no longer going to be governing why would he care as we read chapter 25 we'll see that Festus was yet another unjust judge along with a fellow we'll meet called King Agrippa but but let's take a brief a brief but closer look at Felix I'm going to give you a little historical information it's from the Jewish encyclopedia Felix was a governor of Galilee and he was promoted to be governor of Judea a much larger territory by the emperor Claudius and 52 A.D according to the Roman historian tacitus Felix exercised quote the Royal prerogative in a slavish sense with all manner of cruelties and excesses it was he who excited the bitter feelings of the Jewish Patriots to the highest pitch as they moved closer and closer to open rebellion in the first Jewish revolt Felix was right there putting on the pressure according to Josephus Felix sent the chief of the zealots Eliezer Bay deny and chains to Rome while taking Relentless measures against his followers the zealots whom he'd announced as robbers Joseph Josephus says crucifying them in countless numbers Felix also proceeded rigorously against the would-be prophets that were disturbing the peace with their fanaticism especially against an Egyptian Jew who with several thousand followers attempted to drive the Roman Garrison from Jerusalem but was defeated and that's probably the Egyptian that Claudius lysius mistook Paul for at his arrest Felix's term of office we're told was practically A Reign of Anarchy for even the high Priestly families war with the lower priests we saw that and Paul's trial before the Sanhedrin in Acts 23. during Felix's term the Jewish encyclopedia tells us the Apostle Paul was taken prisoner at caesarea a fierce contest arose at that time between the Jewish and Syrian citizens of caesarea and as Felix acted unjustly toward the Jews it was so bad that he was recalled by Nero about 60 A.D at the intercession of an influential man named palace with neuro Felix escaped punishment so we see Paul was taken prisoner in 58 A.D Felix was recalled in 60. Felix was ruthless plant the Flames of rebellion I I probably need a drink he was also responsible it turns out for the murder of the high priest Jonathan which led to ananias this fellow being the high priest during this period with Paul after eight years under Felix Festus took over the governance of Roman Judea Felix having lost his position due to his persecution of the local Jewish population tried to make amends or at least hoped to secure his own safeties who left caesarea by keeping Paul incarcerated as a favor he was still able to Grant I'm sure you all knew all of that about Felix but I needed to refresh my memory about it so I thought I'd share that with you let's move on now to 25 and verse 1. now when Festus was come into the Province to replace Felix after three days he ascended from caesarea to Jerusalem now as you as you know one always goes up to Jerusalem or comes down from Jerusalem and he most certainly went there to acquaint himself with the Jewish religious leadership pay his respects and introduce himself to them as their new Roman governor then the high priest is ananias and the chief of the Jews informed against Paul notes they laid out their case they made accusations to Festus against Paul and they besought They begged they urged they pleaded with Festus and they the priests desired favor of Festus against Paul that Festus would send for Paul to Jerusalem would transfer Paul to Jerusalem and meanwhile they would be laying in wait the Jewish leaders would be preparing an ambush in the way to kill him these guys don't really like Paul very much do they remember back in Acts 23 there have been a plot to lure Paul to the Jerusalem Council and lay an ambush to kill him on the way at that time it was a youth it was a young boy that saved Paul's life recall Paul's nephew his sister's son heard that an ambush was being planned Paul was going to be summoned to the Jerusalem Council and be killed on the way from the castle to the council by these 40 guys that would be there to Ambush and kill him now we don't know the age of the young man I I'm guessing that he was probably between the age of eight and perhaps as old as 15 that intervene that's why I asked Elijah Andre to portray Paul's nephew when we studied acts 23 some of you might have been here and remembered that Elijah if you're here or streaming or listening great job but how do I was such a young person brother Lyle well it says here acts 23 19 then the chief Captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is it you have to tell me well I see is took him by the hand the 10 year old sure come come here what what is this that you want to tell me a 20 year old he's not going to take him by the hand what do you want right so we can tell from the context that this was a young fellow what if this boy had thought well I'm just a kid no one's going to pay attention to me those guys are probably drunk or something they they probably weren't serious and castles a scary place think about this if that young person had not stepped up overcome his natural fear and Lycia said not believed him Paul would have been killed in the ambush and we would not have the following Epistles Ephesians Philippians Colossians first and second Timothy Titus Philemon Hebrews these wouldn't be in our Bibles today imagine your new testament missing those books those Epistles those letters but they are thanks in part to that boy when you read those sometimes you might think about that this is here because it was a a little boy that overcame his fear and helped his Uncle Paul well back to Acts 25. the priests desired favor of Festus against Paul that Festus would transfer Paul to Jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him verse 4 but Festus refused their request and answered that Paul should be kept Paul's being held in custody at caesarea and that he himself Festus would depart shortly thither too caesarea let them therefore said he which among you are able go down to caesarea with me and Abel here doesn't mean that you're able to travel you're not in firm or something but leaders competent men positions of authority able to make their case go down to assessor with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him press charges against him at trial there the the Roman capital of Judea is caesarea not Jerusalem old court and accessories and when Festus had tarried among them in Jerusalem for more than 10 days he went down to caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgments he wasted no time he convened the court and commanded Paul to be brought to stand trial again this is the third time we call the first trial in Acts 23 Paul perceived that one part this was the Jerusalem Council where Sadducees and the other Pharisees he cried out to the council men and brother and I'm a Pharisee my dad was a Pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead I'm called to question and we read we talked about it before this big fight that they started to have so in verse 10 we read that uh when there arose a great dissension the chief Captain that's Claudia sliceus fearing Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them so it wasn't just a verbal argument it was physically violent we got a couple of boxers here yeah so those guys know what we're talking about commanded the soldiers to get out and take them by force from among them and to bring them into the castle what today we might call protective custody the Roman soldiers had to rescue Paul from that trial a few days later was Paul's second trial before Felix who refused to pass judgment with our new knowledge of Felix what I just read to you and you all memorized from that Jewish encyclopedia rapidly taking detailed notes let's look again at this initial presentation of the prosecutor to Felix and don't worry it's just five verses we read that after five days ananias a high priest descended came down to caesarea from Jerusalem with the elders and with an order named Turtles who informed the governor against Paul so as our brother Daniel pointed out he's a prosecutor knowing what we know about Festus when you read this is just have to shake your head I mean about Felix we just called forth Turtles began to accuse Paul saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness yeah he's getting the Zeal it's all stirred up and crucifying them in countless numbers and that very worthy Deeds are done unto this nation by thy Providence like killing Jonathan the high priest we accept it always and in all places most noble Felix with all thankfulness that Felix may be cruel he's not stupid he can see right through this guy notwithstanding that I be not further tedious unto thee I pray that one is here so they come and see if a few words but now verse 5. knowing what we know about Felix for we have found this man Paul a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition in other words he's lumping Paul with the zealots the ones that they know that Felix chases down and kills Paul's one of these guys a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world not just here everywhere and not a non-ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes oh so he's an attempt to connect Paul and all the other Christians to the zealots these guys really don't like Paula they don't like Christians in Israel when we lived there how many years ago was that close to 50. yeah I guess I can believe it Christians there are known as note Stream So I was a notes error and notes Remus plural it means nazarenes so today the Hebrew word for Christian is Nazarene okay going on let's just see verse 22 which is how we opened this evening when Felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way that is Christianity he deferred them he put this off delayed said when life see us the chief Captain shall come down all know the uttermost of your matter so here we go again it's two years later trial number three before the newly appointed Governor Festus acts 25 verse 7. and when he Paul was come into the courtroom the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about they surrounded Paul and laid many and Grievous complaints against Paul which they could not prove accusations no evidence while he Paul answered for himself I'm sure he was looking at Festus maybe at some of these other guys and said neither against the law of the Jews neither against the temple nor yet against Caesar Roman law have I offended anything at all Festus wanting to the Jews of pleasure answered actually interrupted Paul and said well will you go up to Jerusalem and there be tried and judged of these accusations before me yet another delay Festus has heard the arguments he's been presented with the lack of evidence but he seems to refuse to do his job as a judge Paul's had enough of this nonsense Felix wanted a bribe Festus is having a hard time making a decision now the back route to context is the growing recess of the people of Judea a simmering pot that's about to boil over in Rebellion Festus is a politician is unwilling to do what he already knows is the right thing and he apparently fears the consequences in the context of his new role and just getting acquainted with the other leaders in the complexities of this province called Judea so he's proceeding slowly and carefully then said Paul I stand at Caesar's judgment seat I'm I'm here in a Roman Court where I ought to be judged here in your court in caesarea not in Jerusalem where they only want to kill me to the Jews I've done no wrong that was pretty angry we see a another little bit of Paul's uh temper I think here he publicly scolds Festus to the Jews I have done no wrong as thou very well knowest oops for if I be an offender or have committed anything worthy of death refuse not to die remember from our previous study a Roman citizen condemned to death at least in theory has the right to demand banishment rather than death so Paul's again reminding everyone that he's a Roman citizen but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man May deliver me unto them my accusers frankly including you Governor Festus since you're apparently unwilling to equip me I appeal unto Caesar appeal unto Caesar what does that actually mean repealed to Caesar does that mean the emperor himself would try the case does it mean the case has to have already been decided much like an appellate court in America today what's going on but a Roman law I don't speak Latin I don't pronounce Latin but it's called The Lexington was passed about 20 BC along with many other reforms under Caesar Augustus around that time this is from a textbook of this period by a fellow named FF Bruce if you want to look it up it forbade any magistrate to kill Scourge chain torture or even sentence a Roman citizen who has announced his intention to appeal or prevent him from going to Rome to Lodge's appeal there within a fixed time this is the same law that stopped Claudius lysius from having Paul scourged it's why he feared himself when he'd had Paul bound with chains at his arrest once you realized Paul was a Roman citizen Nero this user at this time became emperor in 54 A.D about the time that Paul set out on his third missionary journey Nero said according to the Roman historian tacitus that he would not be judged in all cases and until 62 or 63 A.D he made no exceptions and just simply wouldn't judge anyone and only did a few after that time so appeals cases were apparently assigned to various officials so thus in Rome Paul would most likely be Tried by an imperial representative subject to Roman law but he had this right to appeal then Festus when he had conferred with the council clearly realizing Paula just given him a way to appease the Jewish religious leaders and wash his hands of the whole mess that Fest Felix had left him answered have you appealed to Caesar under Caesar you'll go oh well some days later after certain days King Agrippa and Bernice Burness is this King agrippa's sister and both are children of a fellow named Herod Agrippa they came into caesarea to salute Festus to greet him congratulate him on his appointment as a procurator of Judea we all know who this guy is right review when we studied acts 12 we went over all the various Kings of portions of Judea in the gospels and acts so this is the Dynasty and a dynasty simply means this guy was ran things and then his kid ran things and his kid ran things and then somebody killed that kid and so they it was so a different family took over so a dynasty is just a family line okay so this is the dynasty of Herod the Great so Herod the Great when the Bible says the in yellow is the the the name that's given in the New Testament when you're reading and that's why it gets confusing because we've got three different people that are all called Herod so Herod the Great was the Herod at the time of Jesus birth and he died about for BC Herod Antipas you see directly below Herod the Great was the Herod of John the Baptist and Jesus judgment he died about 39 A.D over here on the on the on your left no you're right yes yes it's like the fellow said at the train station well if I want to get to this place for the said well turn to the left and you'll be right and the person said don't be emptying it he said well then turn to the right and you'll be left but anyway heroda gripper was a nephew of Herod Antipas and a grandson of Herod the Great it was a herd who persecuted the early Church in Jerusalem and who died after his speech listed in Acts 12 around 44 A.D so when we see this name Agrippa this is actually Herod Agrippa II but in the in acts in 25 and 26 he's simply called Agrippa he's great grandson of Herod the Great and the last of the dynasty he was made King and 53 A.D it turns out that he and Josephus that famous historian were correspondents after the failed Jewish rebellion of 66-73-80 in fact Joseph publishes two or three of the letters that they exchanged in his massive work that's very difficult to read and this Herod Agrippa II was the one who tried to quell the Rebellion he fled your DNA in 66 A.D when it was clear it could not be prevented he eventually died in Rome various sources say it was 92 A.D or 100 A.D well here's his territory and we don't really need to to zoom in on this Z Paul's captivity in caesarea that's where that is this whole green area is the province of Judea under Felix and later under Festus these three little spots that are circled in red that's the domain of Herod Agrippa II so you can see that he really has no jurisdiction in Judea or Samaria so this is a state visit of Pomp and Circumstances it's Trudeau coming down to see Biden or vice versa they we have a common border but not a common government so this visit will read about now in Acts 25 is a formal visit with Pomp and ceremony but Agrippa has no jurisdiction so continuing on verse 14. and when they Agrippa and Bernice had been there in cesarea Festus many days so they're visiting and after a while you know they're probably sitting around having dinner and having a cup of whatever they had a cup of and they're talking about stuff and eventually they get a little bit bored and what are we going to talk about now and how long is this guy going to be hanging around and uh oh hey you know uh Festus uh talks to Griffin he says you know a strange thing there's there's a guy that was left here in bonds by Felix and when I went to Jerusalem when I first came to this place and went up there to check things out and get acquainted with everybody the chief priests and the Elders of the Jews accused this guy to me and that he desire to have judgment against them they they wanted me to condemn this guy to whom I answered it's not the manner of Romans to deliver any man to die before that which he is Accused have the accusers face to face and have license or opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him with which he's charged just because you don't like him doesn't mean I'm going to kill him so I had him come down and when they came hither without any delay on the morrow in fact the very next morning I convened a trial and sat on the Judgment seat and commanded this man Paul to be brought forth against whom when the accusers the priests and council members from Jerusalem stood up they brought no accusation of such things that violate Roman law as I suppose that they were going to do but I have certain questions or charges against them of their own Superstition their religion and some guy called Jesus which was dead but Paul said was alive because I doubted such manner of questions I'm not Jewish I I don't know how to proceed how do I investigate something like this this is all very confusing I asked Paul whether he would go to Jerusalem and never be judged of these matters in their own courts while I presided in Roman law this is known as extraordinum which literally means not on the list of offenses so if a person is broken a law and it's on the oh we can go to chapter so and so of our law book and it says oh yeah no you're not supposed to do this here's the punishment but this is something that wasn't in their list of laws so they had rules for how you deal with that a lot of latitude is given to the governor or the head of a tribunal that's hearing such matters so Festus is saying this isn't a normal offense it's not on the list wants a little help to understand if an offense has actually occurred and if so what a reasonable punishment might be but when Paul had appealed to be reserved under the hearing of Augustus now that's not actually Augustus who's long dead but in other words the emperor I commanded him until I might send him to Caesar you can make that arrangement then Agrippa who knows a lot about Jewish stuff he said oh interesting I I'd like to hear the man myself um tomorrow said Festus you'll hear him and on the morrow when Agrippa was come and purness with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at Festus commandment Paul was brought forth so this is just a big show trial sort of thing it's not even really a trial because he's already appealed to Caesar and Festus said King Agrippa all men which are here present with us you see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me both at Jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer but when I found he had committed nothing worthy of death but which fact I was unwilling to state that the trial and thus set him free but it's obvious that he's innocent and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus that is the emperor because he's been detained for two years is clearly innocent disgusted I wouldn't make the perfectly obvious decision to free him I have determined to send him to Rome of whom but regarding Paul I have no certain thing no specific accusation to write unto my Lord Caesar the emperor the wherefore I have brought him forth before you all and especially before they do okay that after hearing the evidence after examination had I might have something to write maybe you could help me figure out what he is or should be accused of within Roman law or a clear statement of offense of extraordinum I laugh when I read this next verse it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not be able to say what the crimes are against him oh look like a buffoon or at least incompetent if I send him and say I don't know what he did or why I'm sending him to you the next verse then Agrippa said to Paul Thou Art permitted to speak for thyself then Paul stretched forth a hand and answered for himself oh that's acts that's Acts 26. Oh Come Back brother Daniel we'll teach from Acts 26 and tell you about Paul's response to Agrippa what can we learn from Acts 25. to apply to our lives I I think one of the most important things is to not become discouraged like Paul like Joseph we need to persevere those blank spaces in our lives times have drawn times of difficulty in isolation we need to hold fast musicians would please come remind ourselves of the love and grace bestowed upon us by the God we know and love and serve be sensitive to those around us who might be encouraged or helped by contact like like Paul in prison but allowed visitation and assistance by his friends his fellow Believers in spite of continued isolation or opposition this past week Heather and I visited an old friend who was hospitalized had been for several days he commented to us that it was a time of reflection for him to look back on his life to this point and think about things look for opportunity in every situation times for reflection meditation prayer to grow as Christians we need to read our Bibles and spend time in prayer daily there's no substitute for that always remember when Jesus spoke about dividing Souls at the final judgment in Matthew 7 part of The Sermon on the Mount blessed are these and blessed are those his sole Criterion was whether he had known whether he had a relationship with the one being evaluated not what the person did or knew or could quote or recite Miracles wrought in the name of Jesus Christ meant nothing at that day depart from me that work iniquity is what Jesus said Criterion I never knew you I never knew you be sure you know him and be absolutely certain he knows you a personal relationship with Jesus of Nazareth is not optional it's essential we close this part of the service yes okay I guess you're going to do your version rather than mine and that's fine I'd like us to sing at Calvary years I spent in vanity and pride caring not my Lord was crucified knowing not it was for me he died Glory Mercy there was great and Grace was free hard and there was multiplied to me there my burdens all found Liberty [Music] by God's word at last my sin I learned that trembled at the law

Stan [Music] great and Grace [Music] is [Music] amen I gotta read it again what Paul said I I love Paul's personality the guy was tough and you know he he didn't back down and when he knew he was right he would stand up to anybody remember when when the high priest had the guy slap him in the face he was there Chained and he said the Lord's gonna Smite you you Whited wall I love that about Paul says this then said Paul I stand at Caesar's judgment seat where I ought to be judged to the Jews have I done no wrong as thou very well knowest brother Joseph you come close my friend for if I be an offender or have committed anything worthy of death I refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man May deliver me unto them I appeal unto Caesar he was Paul he stood up he knew that they didn't have anything they didn't have anything on him he didn't break any law and the Romans are like what's the deal with these so-called these Jews they hate each other and they want to kill somebody he didn't even break any law I love the way brother Lyle loved the way that you brought that out I love the way the apostle stand strong standing up for
