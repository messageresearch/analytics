[50:45] let's all
[50:48] stand this is someone
[50:51] that I have a lot of confidence
[50:54] in brother Ryan long is
[50:57] I've seen in his ministry that when he
[51:00] opens this
[51:02] Bible brother Ryan is
[51:06] not looking at this Bible to prove a
[51:09] point or to further the narrative that
[51:12] maybe he has grown up with or or
[51:16] that a organization would put forward
[51:19] but when brother Ryan opens this Bible I
[51:22] see a gift in
[51:25] him to where he looks at these
[51:28] words and he seeks
[51:31] out the Lord Lord what do you mean when
[51:34] you're saying these
[51:36] things that's brother Ryan I admire him
[51:40] I highly respect him and I look forward
[51:44] to what the Lord's laid on his heart
[51:47] today brothers and sisters let's not
[51:49] take this for granted this brother is a
[51:52] blessing and I look forward to seeing
[51:56] these bless blessings come out upon all

[55:18] with you this morning God bless you
[55:20] thank you to the Musicians brother
[55:23] Josiah the song leading was just uh I'll
[55:26] just tell you a quick testimony I kind
[55:28] of was sitting in the office there I
[55:30] don't know brother Dan if you've ever
[55:31] done this I was just sitting in the
[55:33] office thinking Lord is this the right
[55:34] thing to talk about this morning is it
[55:36] the right thing you put on my heart is
[55:37] it is it my own thoughts is it my own
[55:39] desires that I want to maybe talk about
[55:41] this subject and uh brother Josiah just
[55:44] started singing I believe led by the
[55:45] Holy Spirit the first song just
[55:47] confirmed it to me this morning it was
[55:49] exactly almost word for word what I had
[55:52] written down and then I thought Lord
[55:54] you're just so good and then he's saying
[55:55] the second song and it was just almost
[55:57] word for word what I had written down
[55:59] and so and I I just appreciate the Lord
[56:03] isn't he
[56:04] good brother Dan you didn't even know it
[56:07] you came back and laid hands and prayed
[56:08] with me and the first words out of your
[56:10] mouth were something I had written down
[56:11] so uh it's not I I know you know it's
[56:15] not me and it's not a man and I know
[56:17] it's not you it's not men and women it's
[56:19] a holy God who has decided for some
[56:23] reason to come down and inhabit your
[56:25] heart in my heart this morning and he's
[56:28] decided why I don't know the reason why
[56:30] other than he loves you and he loves me
[56:33] and and and I'm not worthy and you're
[56:35] not worthy am you're not worthy to hear
[56:37] a gospel but he made you worthy amen yes
[56:41] he did he paid a price for you that
[56:44] there just something I I I just I I
[56:46] repeat it a lot but his his own son the
[56:50] life of his own son he deemed you more
[56:52] precious than that life true oh yes amen
[56:57] he took that life and he laid it down
[57:00] for you for me what more can I do this
[57:04] morning except lift my hands brother
[57:07] Isaac and say all is
[57:09] well All Is Well with My Soul this
[57:12] morning let's just read a scripture and
[57:14] I'll have you be seated
[57:16] it's it's overwhelming to be with you
[57:18] this morning and
[57:21] to just
[57:23] receive the kind of greeting that you
[57:25] you never think somebody would say about
[57:27] you brother Dan and I just love and
[57:29] respect you and my I know my family
[57:31] feels the same about the church here my
[57:33] wife she had family in town visiting and
[57:36] she said I'm sorry I got to leave you
[57:38] we're going down to Tucson to be with
[57:40] the people down there and I I I just
[57:41] appreciated that sacrifice this morning
[57:44] let's just turn to a scripture that way
[57:46] you could be seated in
[57:48] Ezekiel I'm just going to trust the Lord
[57:50] that this is uh this is what he wants to
[57:53] speak on this morning Ezekiel 36
[57:59] I kind of went back and forth the last
[58:00] couple days and weeks on what to talk
[58:02] about and every time I I thought well I
[58:04] i' I'd study on this a little bit maybe
[58:07] a year or two ago and I'll just leave
[58:08] that alone I couldn't get away from it
[58:10] so I'm just going to I'm just going to
[58:11] follow the leading of the Lord this
[58:12] morning Ezekiel
[58:14] 36:25 says then will I sprinkle clean
[58:18] water upon
[58:20] you and ye shall be clean from all your
[58:24] filthiness could you say all all how
[58:27] much of your filthiness
[58:29] all I don't know if we understand that
[58:31] from all your
[58:34] filthiness that means the deepest and
[58:37] darkest and ugliest part that maybe you
[58:40] don't want anybody to know about guess
[58:42] what he will clean you from even that
[58:47] amen when the Lord says all he means
[58:51] all from all your filthiness and from
[58:54] how much of your idols
[58:56] all of your Idols will I cleanse
[59:00] you and he says and a new heart will I
[59:02] give you and a new spirit will I put
[59:05] within you and I will take away the
[59:08] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[59:10] give you a heart of Flesh and I will put
[59:13] my spirit within you and cause you to
[59:18] walk in my statues not because you can
[59:20] do it not because I can do it no he will
[59:24] cause you to walk in statutes and you
[59:27] shall keep my judgments and do them amen
[59:30] you may be
[59:36] seated what a scripture this
[59:39] morning this is this is Ezekiel speaking
[59:42] but he's speaking to the people the same
[59:45] as we've had a Prophet come and speak to
[59:47] the people they speak the mind of God to
[59:50] the people when God wants to say
[59:52] something to you he can do it in many
[59:54] different ways amen but one of the ways
[59:56] he uses is a prophet and this prophet in
[59:59] this day is speaking his own words but
[1:00:01] they're really the words of God and the
[1:00:02] the words of God that he was speaking
[1:00:04] where I want to take the heart out of
[1:00:09] you and I want to put a new heart in you
[1:00:12] amenallah and I I I think about that
[1:00:15] statement and why would a god want to do
[1:00:18] that for
[1:00:20] me why would he want to do that for me
[1:00:22] and I'm going to read you just real
[1:00:24] quick a quote says I I want you to
[1:00:26] listen for a few M moments before
[1:00:28] closing I want you to notice one thing
[1:00:30] and watch closely now a prophet telling
[1:00:32] us listen closely watch closely watch
[1:00:36] the order of the
[1:00:38] scripture I will take away the Stony
[1:00:41] heart and I will give you a new heart
[1:00:43] prise the Lord now the heart if you
[1:00:47] don't get anything else this morning you
[1:00:48] you just remember this this morning the
[1:00:50] heart your heart this right here is the
[1:00:54] dwelling place of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:57] it think about that right here that's
[1:01:01] correct I I don't care if you're not
[1:01:03] good
[1:01:05] enough first thing comes to my mind is
[1:01:07] well I don't know if I'm good enough for
[1:01:09] the Holy Spirit to come and dwell here
[1:01:11] right but this was
[1:01:15] made it was created by
[1:01:19] God as the dwelling place of the Holy
[1:01:22] Spirit
[1:01:27] the heart is the dwelling place of the
[1:01:29] Holy Spirit and I will give you a new
[1:01:32] spirit I want you to watch the order now
[1:01:33] many people get mixed up here they think
[1:01:37] they got the Holy Ghost but they just
[1:01:38] get a new
[1:01:40] spirit watch I'll give you a new heart
[1:01:44] and a new
[1:01:45] spirit and then I will put my spirit now
[1:01:49] the new spirit God had to give you a new
[1:01:52] spirit but that's just a new spirit God
[1:01:54] give you so you could get along with the
[1:01:56] Holy Ghost amen anybody have trouble
[1:01:59] getting along with the Holy Ghost before
[1:02:01] God came into your life maybe you have
[1:02:03] trouble right now getting along with the
[1:02:04] Holy Ghost guess what God has a formula
[1:02:08] he says I'm going to take out that thing
[1:02:09] that doesn't get along with the Holy
[1:02:11] Ghost and I'm going to give you a new
[1:02:12] spirit and a new heart and then you have
[1:02:15] a place in that new heart where God
[1:02:18] himself the creator of everything that
[1:02:21] we see can come and live inside that to
[1:02:24] me is when we talk about the mystery of
[1:02:26] Christ the message that brother man
[1:02:29] preach it's it's a 4-Hour three-hour
[1:02:30] message it boils down to this that
[1:02:34] God could come and live in the heart of
[1:02:39] you that's the mystery of Christ
[1:02:41] revealed right there the whole thing
[1:02:43] wrapped up in a sentence that the god
[1:02:45] the almighty God who's holy who who who
[1:02:49] is so clean sir who he could come down
[1:02:52] and live inside of the heart of somebody
[1:02:55] that was born a
[1:02:58] sinner amen you got to claim that for
[1:03:03] yourself that is the mystery of God
[1:03:06] revealed that is something that the
[1:03:08] devil cannot wrap his mind
[1:03:11] around he cannot wrap his mind around it
[1:03:13] you know that throughout the Millennia
[1:03:16] he has studied that and he cannot figure
[1:03:18] that out why the Lord why God he knows
[1:03:21] God is Holy he was cast out from his
[1:03:24] presence he was not worthy to be in the
[1:03:26] presence of God he cannot figure out why
[1:03:30] you could have God living on the
[1:03:33] inside amen it's because he doesn't have
[1:03:36] a place for the Holy Spirit to dwell in
[1:03:39] amen amen that should that
[1:03:44] should do something to
[1:03:47] us now maybe what that does to you is it
[1:03:49] makes you feel even
[1:03:52] dirtier even more unworthy uhhuh
[1:03:56] but God has a remedy for that as
[1:03:59] well God had to give you a new spirit
[1:04:02] that old Spirit you had you couldn't get
[1:04:04] along with your neighbor anybody say
[1:04:06] Amen to that one you couldn't get along
[1:04:08] with your neighbor we could put in here
[1:04:10] your spouse your children your father
[1:04:12] your mother your
[1:04:14] pastor you couldn't get along he says
[1:04:16] here you couldn't get along with
[1:04:19] yourself anybody ever laid down at night
[1:04:22] and the biggest battle I have is not
[1:04:24] with people around me it's when I lay
[1:04:25] down and I get inside this mind that's
[1:04:28] the battle I have so you know you
[1:04:31] couldn't get along with
[1:04:33] God that's what he says so God gave you
[1:04:36] a new spirit and many times under
[1:04:39] enthusiasm and if you'll watch the life
[1:04:43] that it
[1:04:44] Bears see sometimes we get we get
[1:04:49] emotionally
[1:04:52] enthusiastic you know you have a song
[1:04:54] service like we just had it's to just
[1:04:56] get wrapped up you know because the
[1:04:58] presence is real but that presence is
[1:05:01] there to usher in
[1:05:04] change see you can bask in that presence
[1:05:07] every day of your life and be lost am
[1:05:11] but that presence is there like a
[1:05:13] current bringing a boat down the river
[1:05:16] that presence is there to to to bring in
[1:05:18] change to your life change to your heart
[1:05:22] you can bask in that presence and walk
[1:05:24] out those doors and be the same person
[1:05:26] maybe even be
[1:05:28] worse so when we feel that presence it's
[1:05:31] it I I I appreciate the musicians and
[1:05:33] the song leader because they set that
[1:05:36] atmosphere for the Lord to come in and
[1:05:38] do
[1:05:40] change many times under enthusiasm I
[1:05:43] hope I'm not hurting he says but I hope
[1:05:45] I'm
[1:05:47] uncovering a lot of times you think that
[1:05:49] you have the Holy Spirit and you say I
[1:05:51] sung I spoke in tongues and certainly
[1:05:54] being that close to it you might do all
[1:05:56] of that but that isn't the holy spirit
[1:06:00] yet the Holy Spirit Bears record of
[1:06:05] Jesus
[1:06:07] Christ that's what the Holy Spirit does
[1:06:10] I'm going to tell you this I hope this
[1:06:11] is okay the Holy Spirit doesn't bear
[1:06:13] record of your
[1:06:16] church I I believe in church I go to
[1:06:18] church but it doesn't it doesn't bear
[1:06:20] record of the doctrine of your local
[1:06:22] church it doesn't bear record of your
[1:06:24] thoughts it doesn't bear record of your
[1:06:26] heart it Bears record of one thing Jesus
[1:06:28] Christ that's what the Holy Spirit Bears
[1:06:30] record of and if you have it you'll bear
[1:06:34] record of the same thing you won't care
[1:06:36] about what church so and so goes to or
[1:06:38] you go to or what they believe because
[1:06:40] that's not what the Holy Spirit Bears
[1:06:42] record of it Bears record of Jesus
[1:06:44] Christ in fact if you knew somebody who
[1:06:47] is believing different than you the
[1:06:49] spirit of Christ in you would want them
[1:06:52] to know the truth it would want them to
[1:06:55] know what's right it wouldn't say oh
[1:06:57] they're wrong or they don't see what I
[1:06:58] see no it would want them to know the
[1:07:02] truth and and Out of Love That Spirit of
[1:07:05] Christ would say I'm going to bring them
[1:07:07] the truth in a loving way the way that
[1:07:09] you were brought the
[1:07:11] truth and what keeps you I have a
[1:07:13] question this morning this is a question
[1:07:15] for myself but I but I think that you
[1:07:17] could ask yourself the same thing what
[1:07:19] keeps you from being fully surrendered
[1:07:22] to God
[1:07:26] wow what gets in the way of you being
[1:07:30] used by God the way he wants to use
[1:07:36] you now I can't answer it for you
[1:07:39] correct because I don't I don't know
[1:07:41] your life I don't know your thoughts I
[1:07:42] don't know your heart that's corre I
[1:07:45] know that you and I have a Stony heart
[1:07:49] sometimes now maybe your thought goes
[1:07:51] brother I had a Stony heart
[1:07:55] but he took that
[1:07:57] out but I'm telling you and I'll take
[1:07:59] you to the
[1:08:00] scripture your heart can grow
[1:08:03] Stony amen you could have a soft heart a
[1:08:06] heart of Flesh God can come in and do
[1:08:08] something for you and over time and over
[1:08:12] persecution and over battles and over
[1:08:15] all these things your heart can become
[1:08:19] Stony this scripture is not just for
[1:08:23] when you first heard about the Lord
[1:08:26] this is a scripture we should be reading
[1:08:28] and claiming every single
[1:08:31] day Lord why can't you use me like I
[1:08:34] want to be used anybody ever asked
[1:08:38] that Lord why can I have more Works
[1:08:40] manifesting in my
[1:08:43] life why can't I seem this is a big one
[1:08:46] why can't I seem to overcome the
[1:08:50] enemy now I don't know what the enemy is
[1:08:52] for you it it it could be it could be
[1:08:56] cancer it could be addiction it could be
[1:08:59] bitterness it could be all sorts of
[1:09:02] things but you have an
[1:09:06] enemy where's the where's the Zeal that
[1:09:08] I used to have brother
[1:09:12] Dan where's that burning desire that I
[1:09:14] used to have where's the hunger and the
[1:09:18] thirst for the word of God like I had
[1:09:21] seems like sometimes the world gets in
[1:09:23] the way or or I want to say the let's
[1:09:25] just let's just break it down that's
[1:09:27] such a a blanket statement you know
[1:09:29] sometimes we don't listen to the message
[1:09:31] or or a a person be preached because
[1:09:34] we're listening to something else that
[1:09:36] might be music that might be podcast
[1:09:38] that might be video that might be news
[1:09:39] nobody say
[1:09:41] Amen I'm guilty Lord should I put on
[1:09:45] this tape or should I put on this
[1:09:48] podcast right where's the hunger and The
[1:09:51] Thirst that I used to
[1:09:53] have where I I I used to work and I
[1:09:56] would had headphones and and I would
[1:09:58] listen to it 8 10 hours a day solid and
[1:10:01] now I have 12 hours sitting at a desk
[1:10:03] and sometimes I don't listen to
[1:10:06] him where's the hindrance I know this

[1:10:41] the whole Bible this is a great this is
[1:10:43] a great place to start you know I don't
[1:10:46] know you never really know who you're
[1:10:48] preaching to I see the my family here I
[1:10:50] see the people from Flagstaff brother

[1:11:12] you're new I don't know if you're Elder
[1:11:14] like he was talking about or just off
[1:11:15] the street but I do know this the Bible
[1:11:17] is just as good no matter where you're
[1:11:19] at and the Bible applies no matter where
[1:11:23] you're at I never want to get to the
[1:11:25] Place brother Dan where I think I've
[1:11:27] already accomplished that part of the
[1:11:29] Bible I never want to get to that place
[1:11:31] if you get to that place you have missed
[1:11:33] what the Bible was talking about you
[1:11:35] read a story in the Bible which is truth
[1:11:37] to me this isn't just stories and fables
[1:11:40] this is history to me if you read
[1:11:42] something in the Bible you think a I
[1:11:44] think I got that beat I went through
[1:11:46] that years ago you have missed the
[1:11:48] lesson of that story you have missed it
[1:11:50] go back and read it again there's a
[1:11:53] story here it's a good place to start
[1:11:55] it's talking about Elijah going up on a
[1:11:57] mountain and he's challenging 400
[1:12:00] Priests of Baal and they say our God is
[1:12:03] the real God and Elijah says no my God
[1:12:05] is the real God and I'm sure you know
[1:12:08] the story if you don't you're going to
[1:12:09] hear it for the first time and he
[1:12:10] challenges them he says you I want you
[1:12:13] to offer a sacrifice to your God I'll
[1:12:15] offer one to mine and the one that is
[1:12:18] accepted that God is the true God and
[1:12:21] the the priests gladly take him up on
[1:12:23] this so we'll just we'll take off here
[1:12:25] at verse 22 he says and Elijah said unto
[1:12:27] the people even I only remain a prophet
[1:12:30] of the Lord but baal's prophets are 450
[1:12:33] 450 prophets verses one let them
[1:12:35] therefore give us two Bullocks and let
[1:12:37] them choose one Bullock for themselves
[1:12:39] gives them first choice gives them
[1:12:41] preference you know you're not worried
[1:12:43] about you're not worried about it when
[1:12:44] you have the truth on your side you can
[1:12:46] give the choice to somebody
[1:12:48] else when you have the truth on your
[1:12:50] side you're not worried about it Abraham
[1:12:53] when presented with a choice with lot he
[1:12:54] didn't go I think I really want this
[1:12:56] land when you're LED of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:59] you don't have to worry about making
[1:13:00] choices the holy spirit will lead you
[1:13:02] you can say like Abraham lot I'll give
[1:13:05] you first choice and lot not being led
[1:13:07] by the Holy Spirit chose poorly let them
[1:13:10] choose one Bullock for themselves and
[1:13:12] cut it in pieces and lay it on wood I'm
[1:13:14] going to read a little bit fast if
[1:13:15] that's okay just so we're not on this
[1:13:17] for too long and I will dress the other
[1:13:18] Bullock and lay it on the wood and put
[1:13:20] no fire under no fire under this
[1:13:22] sacrifice and go and call you on the
[1:13:24] name of your God gods and I will call on
[1:13:26] the name of the Lord and the god that
[1:13:30] anth by fire let him be God I want to
[1:13:33] tell you this morning that the god that
[1:13:36] will answer by fire is God and all the
[1:13:39] people answered and said it is well
[1:13:41] spoken the people agreed with this and
[1:13:42] Elijah said un the prophets of baales
[1:13:44] choose you one boock for yourselves and
[1:13:46] dress it first for ye are many and call
[1:13:49] upon the name of your Gods put no fire
[1:13:51] under and they did so uh they uh prayed
[1:13:54] they leaped upon the altar uh verse 27
[1:13:57] it came pass at noon that Elijah mocked
[1:13:59] them and said cry aloud for he is a God
[1:14:02] and neither is talking maybe he's on
[1:14:06] vacation or maybe he's sleeping and must
[1:14:09] be woken and they cried aloud and cut
[1:14:11] themselves after their manner of knives
[1:14:13] and lances till the blood gushed out
[1:14:15] upon them and it came to pass that
[1:14:16] midday was passed and they prophesied
[1:14:19] until the time of offering of the
[1:14:21] evening sacrifice everything in this
[1:14:23] scripture has a meaning
[1:14:26] I want you to notice the time of the day
[1:14:28] and what sacrifice came to be the
[1:14:31] evening
[1:14:32] sacrifice which is the time we believe
[1:14:34] we're living in that there was neither a
[1:14:37] voice nor any to answer nor the any
[1:14:39] regarded and Elijah said un all the
[1:14:41] people come near unto me and all the
[1:14:43] people came near unto him and I want you
[1:14:44] to just focus on this last half and he
[1:14:48] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[1:14:51] broken down yeah praise the Lord praise
[1:14:54] God
[1:14:56] there was an altar of the Lord you can
[1:14:58] go back in Kings and you can go back in
[1:15:01] another in another book
[1:15:04] um I'll think of it in a moment where
[1:15:06] that you can see this altar
[1:15:09] used for God but guess what time had
[1:15:14] passed battles had
[1:15:17] passed persecution had to come yes amen
[1:15:20] and the one a thing that was once the
[1:15:23] altar of the Lord's
[1:15:25] had been broken
[1:15:27] down and Elijah took 12 Stones according
[1:15:30] to the number of the tribes of Sons of
[1:15:32] Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord
[1:15:33] came saying Israel shall be thy name and
[1:15:36] with the stones he built an altar in the
[1:15:39] name of the
[1:15:41] Lord and he made a trench about the
[1:15:43] altar as great as would contain two
[1:15:45] measures of seed and he put the wood in
[1:15:47] order all these things have meaning if
[1:15:49] if we had more time we go into these
[1:15:51] things all these parts of this story
[1:15:53] have meaning to them the bulock in
[1:15:55] pieces and laid them on the wood and
[1:15:57] said fill four barrels with water and
[1:15:59] pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on
[1:16:01] the wood do it a second time do it a
[1:16:03] third time 12 barrels of water
[1:16:08] everything has a meaning here and the
[1:16:10] water ran about the Altar and he filled
[1:16:12] the trench also with water and it came
[1:16:13] to pass at the time of the offering of
[1:16:16] the evening
[1:16:19] sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came
[1:16:23] near if you could I know you if you're
[1:16:27] spiritually minded you can just catch
[1:16:29] where we're at
[1:16:31] today I want to tell you that this scene
[1:16:35] is repeating itself as we speak right
[1:16:39] now we are in the evening time with the
[1:16:42] Elijah message in front of
[1:16:45] us and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac
[1:16:48] and Israel let it be known this day that
[1:16:50] thou art God in Israel and that I am thy
[1:16:54] servant and that I have done all these
[1:16:55] things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear
[1:16:58] me that this people may know that thou
[1:17:01] art the Lord God and that thou Hast
[1:17:04] turned their heart back
[1:17:08] again
[1:17:10] God this whole thing was not to prove
[1:17:13] who God
[1:17:17] was it's what it sounds like he says Let
[1:17:21] The God Who Answers by fire be the true
[1:17:25] God but if you read to the end of this
[1:17:27] chapter they take those 450 men and they
[1:17:30] go slay them they weren't trying to
[1:17:32] prove to these prophets of Bale who the
[1:17:34] real God
[1:17:36] was he was trying to prove to the people
[1:17:40] that God is capable of turning your
[1:17:43] heart back to him
[1:17:48] again this whole thing was not so just
[1:17:51] so a show could go on that a fire could
[1:17:54] could fall as it falls in the next verse
[1:17:57] and consume up the stone and consume the
[1:17:59] water it wasn't a show it was he says
[1:18:03] right here that the people may know that
[1:18:06] thou art the Lord God and that thou Hast
[1:18:09] turned their heart back
[1:18:12] again and when he says that the next
[1:18:15] scripture and then the fire of the Lord
[1:18:19] fell then the fire of the Lord fell
[1:18:22] thanes and consumed the burnt sacrifice
[1:18:25] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:18:27] and licked up the water that was in the
[1:18:30] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:18:32] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:18:34] the Lord he is the God Hallelujah the
[1:18:38] Lord he is the God Amen and maybe I want
[1:18:43] to make the case this morning if it if
[1:18:45] it if it be
[1:18:48] right that I think a lot of times we're
[1:18:50] serving God with a broken heart
[1:18:55] now I don't mean broken heart like
[1:18:57] Hollywood would describe a broken
[1:19:00] heart maybe you think broken heart and
[1:19:02] you think well you think about a a lost
[1:19:05] love right you think about well I got my
[1:19:07] heart broken no I'm talking about I'm
[1:19:10] talking about
[1:19:12] Christians sincere believing Christians
[1:19:15] I think sometimes are serving God with a
[1:19:17] broken
[1:19:19] heart and maybe maybe know it or maybe
[1:19:22] don't even know it
[1:19:26] because the heart is the dwelling place
[1:19:28] of the Holy Spirit yes it is the heart
[1:19:31] is the alar of the Lord yes it is yes it
[1:19:35] is see our our heart is not the
[1:19:38] sacrifice see our heart is not worthy of
[1:19:41] being the sacrifice because the
[1:19:43] sacrifice must be
[1:19:45] innocent and you and I are not
[1:19:48] innocent you know sometimes we think oh
[1:19:51] Lord I'm gonna lay myself on the altar
[1:19:53] no no no you are the
[1:19:56] altar what is laid upon you was the
[1:20:00] innocent
[1:20:02] one and if you read down I we won't read
[1:20:04] it but if you read in the in the in the
[1:20:06] Genesis and exodus it talks about the
[1:20:09] sacrifice and that they would lay the
[1:20:11] the Lamb on that spotless lamb on those
[1:20:14] on that altar of stone why didn't they
[1:20:16] just do it on the ground brother Dan
[1:20:18] because he said they would cut it and
[1:20:20] the blood would flow where down onto the
[1:20:24] altar
[1:20:25] amen you know sometimes we want I I
[1:20:28] don't know we think that our sins are
[1:20:30] covered but in order for your sins to be
[1:20:33] covered by the blood they have to be
[1:20:35] underneath the
[1:20:38] sacrifice a sin that is not placed under
[1:20:41] the sacrifice is not covered by the
[1:20:43] blood although the blood has the power
[1:20:45] to do it yes Jesus Christ has never
[1:20:48] stopped being Jesus Christ he's never
[1:20:51] stopped being slain for us he's never
[1:20:53] stopped being the one who hung on a
[1:20:55] cross and was resurrected and yet
[1:20:57] sometimes our sin is not covered because
[1:20:59] we don't go and place it underneath the
[1:21:03] sacrifice and by not doing that we
[1:21:06] actually serve god with a broken heart
[1:21:08] we serve god with an incomplete
[1:21:11] Altar and I'll tell you if you serve god
[1:21:14] with an incomplete altar this right here
[1:21:15] we were talking about the capacity of
[1:21:17] this heart you know that he cannot come
[1:21:20] down and change
[1:21:23] you how is he supposed to take out a
[1:21:25] Heart of
[1:21:26] Stone when all the stones aren't
[1:21:30] there maybe there's a stone off to the
[1:21:33] side that one that you don't want to
[1:21:34] talk
[1:21:35] about that one that you don't want to
[1:21:37] think about that one that you don't want
[1:21:39] associated with you although it's your
[1:21:41] own thoughts or your own
[1:21:43] desires it's off in the corner it's off
[1:21:46] over here and you say Lord I'm going to
[1:21:48] come to church I'm going to be on time
[1:21:50] today and that's good there's nothing
[1:21:51] wrong with that Lord I'm going to praise
[1:21:53] you I'm going to I'm going to I'm going
[1:21:54] to sing there's nothing wrong with that
[1:21:56] I'm going to pray to you I'm going to
[1:21:58] sit down I'm going to listen to a
[1:21:59] message I'm going to sit down and read
[1:22:00] your Bible and that stone sits in the
[1:22:03] corner and you're serving God maybe I
[1:22:06] don't know what your situation is but I
[1:22:08] find a lot of Christians myself included
[1:22:11] serving God with a broken
[1:22:17] heart your heart has an ability like
[1:22:20] nothing other has the ability of you
[1:22:23] know that you know that angels and
[1:22:25] animals don't have an ability that you
[1:22:27] have you have the ability to decide what
[1:22:31] comes and lives in your
[1:22:33] heart amen you have the
[1:22:36] ability you have free will you have the
[1:22:40] choice to Grant somebody to come and sit
[1:22:43] on the throne of your
[1:22:47] heart it says I believe in Revelations
[1:22:49] it says to him Jesus speaking to him
[1:22:52] that overcometh glory to him that
[1:22:54] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:22:58] in my
[1:22:59] throne and then Jesus says even as I had
[1:23:02] to overcome see he's not going to ask
[1:23:05] you to do something that he is not doing
[1:23:07] that's Jesus say look I made a way for
[1:23:09] you I overcame so that you could see
[1:23:12] that you could overcome because I dwell
[1:23:14] in your heart if you let me to him that
[1:23:17] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:23:19] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[1:23:23] am sat down down with my father in his
[1:23:25] throne there's a scripture in John it
[1:23:28] says in that day you will
[1:23:30] know that I am in my father you and in
[1:23:33] me I in
[1:23:37] you and you think okay well
[1:23:40] that's Jesus is talking about to him
[1:23:42] that overcometh how does that happen the
[1:23:44] scripture right before that right before
[1:23:46] this scripture to him that overcometh
[1:23:48] shows Jesus on the outside of the door
[1:23:50] saying
[1:23:55] amen behold I stand at the door and
[1:23:59] knock what door do you think he's
[1:24:01] standing
[1:24:02] at right right there
[1:24:06] brother behold I stand at the door he
[1:24:08] doesn't have access unless you give it
[1:24:11] to
[1:24:12] him you know he doesn't have access to
[1:24:15] your altar unless you provide him an
[1:24:20] altar we we have a scripture right here
[1:24:22] in the Bible says Elijah
[1:24:25] before this miracle Could Happen had to
[1:24:27] go rebuild the altar of the
[1:24:31] Lord you have a choice to let him in or
[1:24:36] not you have a choice to now you could
[1:24:39] let him in I think I think the I think
[1:24:41] the prophet goes into this he says you
[1:24:42] could let him in but sometimes keep a
[1:24:45] room off off limits to him right anybody
[1:24:49] anybody hear him say that if you don't
[1:24:51] he says you can let them into your heart
[1:24:52] like letting somebody into your house oh
[1:24:54] but you can't open up that closet that's
[1:24:57] the closet I cram everything into and
[1:24:59] that door barely shuts and somebody just
[1:25:02] says one wrong thing to me and that door
[1:25:04] springs open real fast amen I mean
[1:25:08] that's that that's sometimes I find that
[1:25:10] I have that door in my in my house
[1:25:13] somebody just says the wrong word to you
[1:25:16] and man that door flies open real quick
[1:25:18] they get to know the real you yeah my
[1:25:21] wife's laughing because she's she met
[1:25:23] she met the real me a couple times
[1:25:26] I don't I don't mean it that's a joke
[1:25:27] that's not it there's there's things
[1:25:30] that we and I don't know why we do this
[1:25:32] there's things we keep hidden from the
[1:25:36] Lord and you know he doesn't walk
[1:25:39] through your heart and see a door and go
[1:25:42] ah there's probably nothing behind that
[1:25:45] he
[1:25:46] knows he knows and you know why because
[1:25:51] he made
[1:25:52] you he made that heart
[1:25:55] and he sees that door and he kind of
[1:25:56] sees you steer him away from it a little
[1:25:58] bit and he's like oh okay there's still
[1:26:01] a little bit more surrendering that this
[1:26:03] person needs to do to me and here's the
[1:26:06] thing is that he
[1:26:07] wants how how much of your filthiness
[1:26:12] can he cleanse you from all you know he
[1:26:16] wants to take everything that's in that
[1:26:17] room out he and he has the ability to
[1:26:21] take everything in that room out and
[1:26:24] you'll never see it again amen amen and
[1:26:28] we know this we know this and yet we
[1:26:31] keep that door
[1:26:32] closed and and I'm going to tell you
[1:26:35] what why I think we do it and that's
[1:26:37] because I think we're ashamed of
[1:26:40] it I think we're ashamed of it amen amen
[1:26:44] when I think about the things that I'm
[1:26:47] lacking
[1:26:48] in I'm ashamed of that
[1:26:52] amen when when I think about my prayer
[1:26:55] life and how it's not what it should be
[1:26:58] I'm ashamed of
[1:26:59] that and that's not something I want to
[1:27:01] go sometimes and tell everybody that's
[1:27:03] not something I want to talk about
[1:27:05] sometimes sometimes that's something I
[1:27:07] want to keep to
[1:27:08] myself and say Lord I'm going to work on
[1:27:11] that Lord I'll get better right anybody
[1:27:13] ever said that Lord I I'll do better
[1:27:15] Lord I'll
[1:27:17] try all we're doing is just keeping that
[1:27:19] door locked off for him you know that
[1:27:21] you cannot change
[1:27:24] amen you know that you can't change amen
[1:27:27] and I know that I can't change and yet I
[1:27:29] keep the door
[1:27:32] locked and why would you not let Jesus
[1:27:35] into every room in your heart seems like
[1:27:37] a brother Kurt seems like a real simple
[1:27:39] thing right would you let him into every
[1:27:41] heart we would say amen and now it comes
[1:27:44] time to do
[1:27:46] it amen and and I don't know I'm not
[1:27:49] trying to tell you have I'm not somebody
[1:27:50] that says you have secret sins and you
[1:27:52] have all these things going I don't know
[1:27:53] you I don't I know what's going on in
[1:27:54] your life I just know how the devil
[1:27:57] works and I know how your heart works
[1:28:00] because I'm I'm like you my heart works
[1:28:02] the same way I know that we have things
[1:28:05] that we are ashamed
[1:28:07] of most of the time it's things that we
[1:28:09] cannot control it's things that we do
[1:28:11] that we don't want to do or things that
[1:28:13] we want to do but we don't do them amen
[1:28:17] a lot of times it's I'm just going to
[1:28:19] say I don't know why but a lot of times
[1:28:20] that thing that we hold back is
[1:28:22] forgiveness amen you know may not even
[1:28:25] be something that you're doing wrong I
[1:28:26] don't want to tell you you have all
[1:28:27] these things wrong and secret sins and
[1:28:29] what are you you know what are you
[1:28:30] hiding no no sometimes it's just as
[1:28:32] simple as you cannot let your pride go
[1:28:35] long enough to forgive somebody and I
[1:28:38] want to tell you if that's the case
[1:28:40] you're serving God with a broken
[1:28:42] heart you are presenting God an altar
[1:28:46] that's incomplete and expecting a fire
[1:28:48] to
[1:28:51] fall and you might feel good because the
[1:28:54] music was good you might feel good
[1:28:56] because the preaching was good and then
[1:28:57] you go out and you say why don't I feel
[1:29:00] any different two days
[1:29:01] later three days later where was the
[1:29:04] victory I had last Sunday where was the
[1:29:06] victory I had last
[1:29:10] Wednesday and the answer is simple in
[1:29:12] order for you to let him in you have to
[1:29:14] rebuild your heart how do you rebuild
[1:29:16] your
[1:29:18] heart to present to God an altar that is
[1:29:22] complete
[1:29:25] now that also sounds simple that's not
[1:29:27] very
[1:29:28] simple well I actually I want to tell
[1:29:30] you this it's actually really
[1:29:33] simple I after I thought about it for
[1:29:36] like five seconds it's actually really
[1:29:38] really simple it's just hard to
[1:29:41] do the simplest things are most likely
[1:29:44] the hardest things to do now we can
[1:29:47] complicate them I know I'm not preaching
[1:29:50] to anybody who's ever been in church for
[1:29:52] a long time right now we can comp
[1:29:54] complicate them so that we don't have to
[1:29:56] make things right we can read and we can
[1:29:59] cover it up with a quote covered up with
[1:30:01] a scripture covered up with a good
[1:30:03] feeling covered up with a good song
[1:30:05] service and say maybe that thing has
[1:30:07] gone
[1:30:08] away until you lay
[1:30:10] down and you battle the only person
[1:30:12] that's there yes and you know that it's
[1:30:15] not gone somebody was saying something
[1:30:17] the other day up there in flag and say
[1:30:19] you think you've forgiven somebody man
[1:30:21] the Lord just just like hit me over the
[1:30:23] head with a sledg
[1:30:24] you think you've forgiven somebody and
[1:30:27] you convince yourself you have until you
[1:30:29] see
[1:30:30] them until their name's brought up until
[1:30:34] somebody else talks about them and then
[1:30:35] you'll know whether you've forgiven them
[1:30:37] or
[1:30:37] not right oh Lord I've I've I I just
[1:30:41] nothing but fellowship with those people
[1:30:44] right well why don't you fellowship with
[1:30:46] them well you
[1:30:48] know yeah I was busy but I love them I
[1:30:52] sure love them and and and I I I don't
[1:30:54] mean to be funny but like really I
[1:30:55] thought that I've had the love of
[1:30:58] God and then God put me in a situation
[1:31:01] where I needed the love of God and then
[1:31:03] I didn't have
[1:31:05] it and you know that's that seems cruel
[1:31:07] no that's that's that's the most
[1:31:09] merciful and graceful thing that he
[1:31:11] could do to put you in a situation that
[1:31:14] exposes whether you have what you say
[1:31:17] you have or not he'll actually put you
[1:31:19] in a situation against 450 enemies so
[1:31:23] you can see if your altar is built up or
[1:31:25] if it's broken
[1:31:27] down and it's not to shame you no it's
[1:31:31] for him to say now look I am the Lord
[1:31:33] thy God and I want you to know that if
[1:31:36] you do this I will turn your heart back
[1:31:39] to
[1:31:40] me I want to take out the Stony heart
[1:31:44] from your from you and put in a new
[1:31:47] heart but I can only do that when you
[1:31:49] present a Stony heart to
[1:31:52] me and that's something that we I don't
[1:31:55] know about you but that's something that
[1:31:56] we struggle with is presenting to God
[1:32:00] our ugly
[1:32:02] Parts amen presenting to God the things
[1:32:05] that we're ashamed of although he's the
[1:32:07] one we should be going to with them
[1:32:10] sometimes it's easier to keep it to
[1:32:12] ourselves or maybe we'll let it out on
[1:32:14] somebody else right and the person that
[1:32:16] we should be I know this is so basic
[1:32:18] this is not this is not high level but
[1:32:21] but you should be understanding what I'm
[1:32:22] saying and I think if you're honest with
[1:32:24] yourself you have done this at some
[1:32:26] point maybe you are doing this at some
[1:32:28] point maybe you're going
[1:32:31] to it it seems so simple to just present
[1:32:35] to God oh Lord I'm a sinner that's
[1:32:38] such I don't want to speak bad about
[1:32:41] that but that's such a generic
[1:32:43] statement now I I'm not I'm not against
[1:32:45] I'm not saying I'm not against saying
[1:32:47] Lord I'm a sinner it's all through the
[1:32:49] Bible Paul says chiefest of Sinner
[1:32:51] Sinners but
[1:32:52] listen some sometimes you don't want to
[1:32:54] get specific with the
[1:32:56] Lord right sometimes we don't it's just
[1:32:59] easier to say Lord I'm a sinner you know
[1:33:02] what's wrong and you know what we're
[1:33:04] doing we're steering them away from the
[1:33:06] door and saying oh you have full you
[1:33:09] have full rain of My Heart Lord you have
[1:33:11] full you you know you know yes he knows
[1:33:15] but you have to rebuild it amen because
[1:33:18] he's not going to force his way into
[1:33:20] your
[1:33:21] heart I want to tell you that he has the
[1:33:24] capability maybe of opening that door
[1:33:26] but he's not going to do
[1:33:28] it he's not going to open the door that
[1:33:31] you keep shut you have to open it now
[1:33:35] when you open it and you tell them
[1:33:38] what's in
[1:33:39] there now he has the power now he has
[1:33:43] the love to say I'm going to cleanse you
[1:33:47] of all your
[1:33:50] filthiness all your Idols every thing
[1:33:54] behind that door I can cleanse you from
[1:33:57] all I want you to do is open it help us
[1:34:00] Lord Jesus you know sometimes he's not
[1:34:02] even outside your heart
[1:34:04] knocking sometimes he's already inside
[1:34:06] your heart but he's knocking at that
[1:34:08] door you keep close to him you know and
[1:34:11] that that's a trick sometimes because
[1:34:12] sometimes people think oh I I let the
[1:34:14] Lord into my heart and I believe you
[1:34:17] did this message isn't for me because I
[1:34:19] let him in my heart years ago brother
[1:34:21] Dan I believe that you did but he's
[1:34:22] still out a door
[1:34:25] knocking oh I've walked throughout this
[1:34:27] I've walked throughout this heart for 10
[1:34:29] years but I've never been inside that
[1:34:31] little
[1:34:34] room I'm I'm I'm telling you I've SE
[1:34:37] I've been there I I'm telling you that
[1:34:39] this is real because it's it's my
[1:34:41] testimony I have served God most of my
[1:34:44] life with an incomplete
[1:34:48] heart raising my hands praising him
[1:34:52] saying that he's done this and he's
[1:34:54] genuinely done things for me performed
[1:34:56] miracles for me and yet I did not open
[1:34:58] all the doors yes amen and and I know
[1:35:01] you want to serve him yes I'm not
[1:35:04] telling you you have bad motive I'm not
[1:35:06] saying that you do it maliciously I know
[1:35:08] that you want to be used of God ises any
[1:35:10] does anybody is anybody not want to be
[1:35:13] used of God okay that was easier that
[1:35:15] way that way you don't have to lift your
[1:35:17] hand if you don't want
[1:35:19] to everybody wants
[1:35:22] God right
[1:35:25] yes
[1:35:27] amen maybe you think you're not worthy
[1:35:29] enough maybe you think you're not clean
[1:35:32] enough but you can never be that way
[1:35:35] unless those parts get exposed
[1:35:37] amen what are the stones of your heart
[1:35:41] and simply they're the things that you
[1:35:42] are most ashamed
[1:35:45] of Amen I don't know what that is amen I
[1:35:49] don't know what you are most ashamed of
[1:35:51] what you don't want the Lord to know
[1:35:53] although though he
[1:35:55] knows and and and you know sometimes I'm
[1:35:58] just going to say this if if it doesn't
[1:36:00] apply don't apply it a lot of times it's
[1:36:03] not even what the Lord thinks sometimes
[1:36:05] we're worried about what the person next
[1:36:07] to us
[1:36:09] thinks you know sometimes the Lord's not
[1:36:11] even
[1:36:13] considered sometimes it's what would my
[1:36:16] church think about me if if if I were to
[1:36:19] say I struggle with X Y or Z what would
[1:36:23] the people my church think about me I
[1:36:25] have been a Christian for a year I've
[1:36:27] been a Christian for 10 years I've been
[1:36:29] a Christian for 30 years there nobody
[1:36:32] would want to hear that I have this
[1:36:35] problem and so the stone just gets
[1:36:38] thrown in the corner because I think
[1:36:40] sometimes we care I don't know do you
[1:36:42] care a little bit too much about what
[1:36:43] people
[1:36:44] think let's just be honest maybe you
[1:36:47] don't but I
[1:36:51] care and I got to the thing is we have
[1:36:53] to stop
[1:36:54] caring what's more important yes what's
[1:36:58] more important I want to ask you this
[1:37:00] morning what's more important that God
[1:37:03] himself come and live literally
[1:37:06] literally the life of God come and live
[1:37:08] in your heart or for somebody not to
[1:37:11] think bad of
[1:37:13] you when you put it in perspective it it
[1:37:16] shouldn't be a decision it shouldn't be
[1:37:19] a choice but sometimes we're presented
[1:37:21] with that choice and because of how we
[1:37:23] are as human beings and we're prideful
[1:37:25] and we care I I going to tell you to
[1:37:28] stop caring what somebody else thinks
[1:37:30] you can't but you got to care about
[1:37:32] something else
[1:37:34] more brother Bram says this the thing of
[1:37:37] it today is we don't try to establish
[1:37:39] the word of God in people's hearts now
[1:37:42] now maybe maybe I'll get on uh maybe
[1:37:44] I'll get on the ministry a little bit
[1:37:46] maybe I'll get on the churches a little
[1:37:49] bit we don't try to establish the word
[1:37:51] of God in people's hearts he says we are
[1:37:53] trying to establish
[1:37:57] ourselves you have to see it our way you
[1:38:00] have to believe it my way you have to
[1:38:03] believe it I mean even down to you got
[1:38:04] to believe it this Church's way I know
[1:38:06] there's other churches but this Church's
[1:38:08] way right we're trying to establish
[1:38:11] ourselves in somebody's heart rather
[1:38:13] than Jesus Christ but guess what the
[1:38:14] Holy Spirit only Bears record of one
[1:38:16] thing it doesn't bear record of you or
[1:38:19] your Doctrine or your church and I'm not
[1:38:21] speaking against churches now Bears
[1:38:23] record of Jesus Christ Alone Hallelujah
[1:38:26] we are trying to establish ourselves
[1:38:28] churches are trying to establish now if
[1:38:31] you didn't like when I said it you got
[1:38:33] to take it over with brother brandom
[1:38:34] churches are trying to establish the
[1:38:36] doctrine of a church in a person's heart
[1:38:39] that's what he
[1:38:40] says rather than lead them to the truth
[1:38:44] they'll lead them to our truth and and
[1:38:47] and I don't mean that even is bad but we
[1:38:48] we we'll leave it to our truth because
[1:38:50] we believe we have the truth
[1:38:54] that it's what happens and I don't think
[1:38:56] we do it maliciously but we do it we do
[1:38:59] it and I don't know if you if we can see
[1:39:01] that even with our family members
[1:39:03] sometimes that if we try to get them to
[1:39:05] believe our way and do things our way
[1:39:08] brother Daniel follow our rule book like
[1:39:10] we were talking about last night they
[1:39:12] can't make it to change that's because
[1:39:17] they haven't made it to the one who can
[1:39:18] make the change and I know this is so
[1:39:21] simple it's so basic but but yet this is
[1:39:24] where I feel like this is where we we
[1:39:26] struggle I think if you want to see
[1:39:29] Miracles and you want to see the Lord
[1:39:30] working in your life you have to take
[1:39:32] care of this Altar and and and you do
[1:39:35] you think that God is not capable of it
[1:39:37] do you think God is not capable of
[1:39:39] sending a consuming
[1:39:41] fire he's capable of it he's in it's in
[1:39:44] the Bible I've seen it happen there was
[1:39:46] two men there was two men walking to
[1:39:49] emus they're walking along they they
[1:39:51] don't have any plans and I'm man appears
[1:39:54] with them and starts to talk with them
[1:39:55] and the Bible says they looked at each
[1:39:58] other and said what didn't in our hearts
[1:40:01] burn within us as he talked with us and
[1:40:05] opened to us the scriptures there's
[1:40:08] literally in the Bible two men walking
[1:40:11] that a consuming fire is falling on the
[1:40:13] altar of their heart right there didn't
[1:40:15] in our hearts burn within us I imagine
[1:40:20] they maybe had some things that the Lord
[1:40:21] had to cleanse them from and they and he
[1:40:24] did it and they didn't even realize he
[1:40:25] was doing it what did it take it took
[1:40:28] them talking with the
[1:40:30] Lord it took them just H it's so simple
[1:40:34] talking with
[1:40:37] Jesus we sing a song I must tell Jesus
[1:40:41] but do we tell
[1:40:43] him the song says I must tell Jesus all
[1:40:48] of my
[1:40:50] troubles or are you too ashamed to them
[1:40:53] to tell
[1:40:55] him I'm telling you if you are you're
[1:40:58] hanging on to it and and whether you
[1:41:00] agree with me or not you're serving God
[1:41:03] I don't it doesn't matter how he's
[1:41:06] manifesting himself you're serving him
[1:41:08] with a broken
[1:41:11] heart in Mark there's a story about seed
[1:41:14] casting it says and I'll just read the
[1:41:16] one it says these are like those which
[1:41:18] swn on Stony ground so genuine word of
[1:41:22] God from a Vindicated Source can come
[1:41:26] forth and you can hear it amen think
[1:41:30] about that let's just let's just I don't
[1:41:32] want to rush past that that
[1:41:35] is God the godre the same God who who
[1:41:41] who burnt up this
[1:41:43] altar speaking words directly to you
[1:41:47] just just like let that sink
[1:41:48] in The God Who made the universe who
[1:41:52] created a drop of dew on a blade of
[1:41:54] grass to the largest star took the time
[1:41:59] to speak directly to
[1:42:03] you and that's all he wants to do is
[1:42:05] have a conversation with
[1:42:09] you and then you couldn't you couldn't
[1:42:13] talk back to
[1:42:16] him then he sent his son Oh Glory to
[1:42:20] make a way Hallelujah for you to be able
[1:42:22] to talk back to
[1:42:24] him because when he sees you he doesn't
[1:42:28] see
[1:42:29] you when he sees the
[1:42:33] room and he should out of out of justice
[1:42:37] and
[1:42:38] righteousness he should destroy
[1:42:41] you except when you when you give that
[1:42:45] to him you have now placed yourself
[1:42:48] under the sacrifice and now he doesn't
[1:42:51] see you he sees Jesus laying
[1:42:55] there this is about as basic as
[1:42:58] Christianity gets but I maybe we just
[1:43:00] skip past this a little bit or maybe we
[1:43:02] we we know it but maybe after time the
[1:43:06] heart grows Stony again it grows hard
[1:43:09] again it gets callous maybe that's a
[1:43:11] better
[1:43:12] word these are like those which swn on
[1:43:15] Stony ground when they have heard the
[1:43:17] word immediately receive it with
[1:43:21] gladness cuz sounds good right cuz it is
[1:43:25] good but they have no root in themsel
[1:43:28] and so
[1:43:29] endure but for a
[1:43:32] time now how long is that time it could
[1:43:35] be tomorrow it it might be this
[1:43:38] afternoon it might be a year it might be
[1:43:40] 10 years but
[1:43:43] eventually it makes itself
[1:43:46] known for a Time afterwards and when
[1:43:49] Affliction or persecution ariseth for
[1:43:51] the words sake
[1:43:54] sake immediately they are
[1:43:59] offended God is going to put you in a
[1:44:02] situation for the word's sake that you
[1:44:06] will be persecuted you will be hated you
[1:44:10] will suffer so he can see what is inside
[1:44:13] of
[1:44:14] you and really so you can see what's
[1:44:17] inside of you
[1:44:23] you know sometimes we think we have
[1:44:24] fellowship with
[1:44:27] Believers until we need to have
[1:44:29] fellowship with
[1:44:32] Believers you know I don't for me I
[1:44:35] don't know if it's you know sometimes I
[1:44:37] lack compassion lack
[1:44:40] empathy the Lord's going to he has and
[1:44:44] he puts me in
[1:44:45] situations where that comes
[1:44:49] out and he says you know what you might
[1:44:51] be doing this right oh you might go to a
[1:44:53] message Church oh you might Minister
[1:44:55] here you might play the this none of
[1:44:58] that matters none of that
[1:45:01] matters if you present before him if I
[1:45:04] present before him an incomplete heart
[1:45:07] those things don't
[1:45:09] matter they're good in their place but
[1:45:12] that is not what he made me for he made
[1:45:16] me to be the dwelling place of the Holy
[1:45:20] Spirit
[1:45:25] I I I just want to maybe in
[1:45:30] closing God wants to remove all those
[1:45:33] things from your life how
[1:45:35] much there's not a single thing you say
[1:45:39] I know I know what comes up I know what
[1:45:41] comes up in the mind brother you don't
[1:45:44] know you don't know the thing that I
[1:45:47] struggle with and I want to tell you I
[1:45:49] know
[1:45:51] it but you know what it doesn't matter
[1:45:53] if I know it because he knows it and I
[1:45:56] want to tell you that when he says all
[1:45:59] he means
[1:46:01] all and I want to tell you the worst sin
[1:46:04] you could think of in his eyes is the
[1:46:07] same as the littlest white
[1:46:10] lie so sometimes we fool oursel oh well
[1:46:13] I don't I don't have the problem I don't
[1:46:14] know if we ever say this maybe I'm just
[1:46:15] making this up but I don't have the
[1:46:17] problems of that
[1:46:19] person maybe I don't have that drug
[1:46:21] issue maybe I don't have that addiction
[1:46:23] issue yeah but if if you have the
[1:46:26] littlest Stone left out of that
[1:46:29] altar the result is exactly the
[1:46:35] same and and I
[1:46:38] think I think it's time we stop
[1:46:40] presenting god with a beautiful
[1:46:45] altar amen I I really think that's I
[1:46:48] think that's what it boils down to I
[1:46:49] think we need to stop presenting God
[1:46:52] with what we think a Christian should
[1:46:55] look like should act like should speak
[1:46:58] like we need to can I just read you this
[1:47:01] it's a little bit long but can I read
[1:47:02] you this it says what what it is this is
[1:47:05] not my words this William random how is
[1:47:08] your heart with God
[1:47:10] tonight that is the
[1:47:15] question if it's the question then it's
[1:47:17] the question
[1:47:19] now Jesus never come for us to build big
[1:47:22] churches
[1:47:24] listen here let me tell you something
[1:47:25] and this is on the side I like how you
[1:47:28] gave us a little bit on the
[1:47:29] side Jesus never asked us to ordain or
[1:47:32] make any church he never left us word
[1:47:35] for us to build a church he never left
[1:47:37] word for us to organization a seminary
[1:47:40] he never left word for a hospital he
[1:47:42] never left a word for school or
[1:47:43] education but he did say to the church
[1:47:46] preach the gospel into all the world and
[1:47:48] then I will
[1:47:50] return I appreciated even the youth last
[1:47:52] night night that they you could say what
[1:47:55] you want but when was the last time you
[1:47:57] brought a stranger to
[1:48:00] church now you you you might may maybe
[1:48:03] you have that's good but I'm saying when
[1:48:05] I saw that last night that that to me is
[1:48:09] the scripture being fulfilled that's
[1:48:11] somebody who says the
[1:48:13] commission given go into all the world
[1:48:17] preach the gospel they're do oh they're
[1:48:20] 20 years old 18 years old yeah they're
[1:48:21] doing it right they're doing it you know
[1:48:24] why because they're not ashamed of what
[1:48:26] they believe in and I think about I
[1:48:29] think about when was the last time I
[1:48:31] went up to a stranger and I said I want
[1:48:33] you to come to church with
[1:48:35] me no instead we just go to church it's
[1:48:39] I hope this doesn't offend but we go to
[1:48:40] church with the same people we've always
[1:48:42] gone to church with right because we all
[1:48:45] think the same we all agree the same we
[1:48:47] all we all say Amen to the same things
[1:48:50] but that's not what church is about and
[1:48:52] that's not what the Life of Christ is
[1:48:54] about that's not what the Holy Spirit
[1:48:56] Bears record of what he Bears record of
[1:48:59] is what he did for you and that's going
[1:49:02] to get a soul and bring him it's not
[1:49:05] this
[1:49:05] building it's not this building it's
[1:49:08] bringing that heart to a place where
[1:49:11] they want to rebuild their altar where
[1:49:14] they want to say Lord you created this
[1:49:16] heart I I I didn't know that you were my
[1:49:19] Creator but now I know and I I want to
[1:49:21] open up every every door to you and I
[1:49:24] tell you that somebody walking in off
[1:49:26] the street has an easier time than that
[1:49:28] than those of us that have been in
[1:49:29] church most of our life that's the that
[1:49:32] is the truth I you might not agree with
[1:49:35] that is the truth somebody coming off
[1:49:37] the street has a much easier time saying
[1:49:39] Lord I'm filthy just take me then some
[1:49:42] of us that that have sat in a Pew a
[1:49:44] whole life and don't want anybody to
[1:49:46] know there's still a door we haven't
[1:49:47] opened up there's still a heart you say
[1:49:51] Lord I I I've I've so many things have
[1:49:53] happened in my life and I agree with you
[1:49:55] but sometimes you're serving God with a
[1:49:57] broken heart because there's something
[1:49:59] you're leaving out of your sacrifice and
[1:50:02] I'm telling you as mighty as God is he
[1:50:04] won't come down in a consuming fire
[1:50:07] until that altar is
[1:50:09] rebuilt because he won't force it upon
[1:50:12] you nothing against organization church
[1:50:15] and Hospital they're all right but we
[1:50:16] put our emphasis on that instead of
[1:50:18] taking the gospel to the world when
[1:50:21] 2third of the world tonight has never
[1:50:23] heard of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:25] Christ but yet I have the Holy Spirit
[1:50:27] that Bears record of him where is it
[1:50:29] bearing record of him oh in the in the
[1:50:32] in the room where everybody agrees with
[1:50:33] me that's not what it's
[1:50:36] for you say well brother I'm not a
[1:50:38] minister he has made you an able
[1:50:41] minister of the Gospel it's not behind
[1:50:44] this little square wooden desk go into
[1:50:48] all the world in the grocery store go in
[1:50:51] the gas station when you go on your
[1:50:53] vacation you can be a record of the Holy
[1:50:56] Spirit which is Jesus
[1:51:00] Christ you say how can I do
[1:51:02] that a consuming fire must come in and
[1:51:07] take out that Stony heart you're if
[1:51:10] you're trying to do it you're failing
[1:51:12] right
[1:51:13] there the moment you tried to do it you
[1:51:15] failed already now I'm not saying it
[1:51:18] doesn't take effort it doesn't take
[1:51:19] thought about it but when you try to
[1:51:21] work I don't know when I try to work
[1:51:22] work it up brother Dan it's it's when it
[1:51:24] fails
[1:51:28] miserably how can he come when
[1:51:30] two-thirds of the world tonight has
[1:51:31] never heard the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:51:33] will come you want do you want him to
[1:51:37] come that's a that's a legitimate
[1:51:39] question because maybe maybe you don't
[1:51:40] want him to come because maybe that door
[1:51:43] hasn't been opened yet you know a lot of
[1:51:46] people you don't have to raise your hand
[1:51:48] but a lot of people actually are afraid
[1:51:50] of the
[1:51:51] rapture they're actually afraid of the
[1:51:53] Lord coming because the house hasn't
[1:51:55] been cleaned out
[1:51:57] yet and we know it hasn't been cleaned
[1:52:01] and we put it
[1:52:04] off how can he come he'll come when the
[1:52:09] gospel has been preached not passing
[1:52:11] tracks they're all right but preach the
[1:52:13] gospel means demonstrate the power of
[1:52:16] the Holy Ghost to All Nations that I
[1:52:19] will call as a witness now this is what
[1:52:21] I tell you I think we need to to stop
[1:52:22] presenting god with a beautiful
[1:52:24] altar if you don't do it you could just
[1:52:28] you don't have to take that
[1:52:29] part notice Cain back there just as
[1:52:32] religious as he could be walked up and
[1:52:35] down and made a beautiful
[1:52:38] altar offered up his sacrifice knelt
[1:52:41] down with all of his pomp just like his
[1:52:43] daddy he wasn't an
[1:52:46] atheist he wasn't an unbeliever no sir
[1:52:50] he was a believer
[1:52:53] oh brother I'm a Believer that's good
[1:52:56] that's not
[1:52:58] enough there can't knelt down and
[1:53:00] worshiped oh brother I worship that's
[1:53:03] good that doesn't separate you fixed all
[1:53:07] the big lies I imagine upon his Altar
[1:53:09] and brought the fruits of the field and
[1:53:10] laid them there and knelt down and said
[1:53:12] now Jehovah look how pretty this altar
[1:53:14] is look at the old common altar that a
[1:53:17] bunch of holy rollers look how pretty
[1:53:19] this Christian is now maybe now I I
[1:53:22] don't think any of us say this in our
[1:53:25] mind but when we don't include all of
[1:53:29] the parts that we're ashamed of we're
[1:53:31] presenting to him what we think he wants
[1:53:33] to
[1:53:37] see just looking over there uh at that
[1:53:40] old common altar that bunch of Holy
[1:53:42] Rollers has over there look at that old
[1:53:44] common place they're worshiping in that
[1:53:45] guy Abel that old stinky lamb hanging up
[1:53:49] there look here what I've done for you
[1:53:51] I've built this great church I've put
[1:53:52] everything down here see what I am I've
[1:53:55] done something big it'll bring people in
[1:53:58] that's the works of the
[1:54:01] devil that's what he
[1:54:03] says now receive me Jehovah you know I
[1:54:07] believe in
[1:54:09] it and God flatly refused
[1:54:13] him here come little old Abel pulling
[1:54:16] that Lamb with a spiritual Revelation Oh
[1:54:19] Glory how did he have a spiritual
[1:54:21] revelation brother Kurt he had a talk
[1:54:24] with
[1:54:26] God I imagine Abel said my heart just
[1:54:32] burned within
[1:54:33] me as he opened the scriptures to me as
[1:54:37] he opened up his word to
[1:54:40] me he know that it wasn't fruit that
[1:54:43] brought them out of the Garden of
[1:54:46] Eden and life don't lay in plants
[1:54:52] it lays in
[1:54:54] blood here he come with a little string
[1:54:56] wrapped around or a great Vine around
[1:54:57] that little lamb throwed him up here and
[1:54:59] said this is it Lord and God said that's
[1:55:03] justification
[1:55:06] oh and then look his brother was jealous
[1:55:09] of him that jealous streak never leaves
[1:55:12] that High Society
[1:55:18] class I wasn't going to go here but I'm
[1:55:20] just going to go here I think some
[1:55:22] sometimes in the message we have high
[1:55:24] society class in the
[1:55:26] message we have high society we have
[1:55:31] Elites in the
[1:55:34] message we have an attitude sometimes
[1:55:36] that we are better than someone else
[1:55:39] who's in the message who believes what
[1:55:41] we
[1:55:44] believe because maybe the Lord has done
[1:55:46] more for us I don't think it's even
[1:55:48] necessarily bad maybe he's done more for
[1:55:51] us but as soon soon as we have the
[1:55:55] attitude I don't know if you you get
[1:55:57] this as soon as you have the attitude or
[1:56:00] the thought that you are better than a
[1:56:03] sinner on the
[1:56:04] street I'm sorry but you have lost what
[1:56:07] the Lord did for
[1:56:09] you you have lost
[1:56:11] it I'm not saying you're lost I'm not
[1:56:14] saying you can't get it back but the
[1:56:16] moment you think that you're
[1:56:18] better you have lost sight of what he
[1:56:20] did for you
[1:56:22] amen and I'm telling you at that moment
[1:56:24] you are not serving him with a complete
[1:56:28] heart no sir it's still there it's still
[1:56:31] there and it won't leave he says when
[1:56:34] Adam in the Garden of Eden and Eve whose
[1:56:36] children were cast out I just want to
[1:56:39] get I I'll I'll close
[1:56:44] here he says I'll build a beautiful
[1:56:46] altar I'll put flowers on it I'll put
[1:56:48] fruits fruits on it I'll make it pretty
[1:56:50] surely I can appease god with this this
[1:56:52] and let him know that I'm sincere in my
[1:56:56] heart he was right as far as the word
[1:57:00] went God wanted worship he went to
[1:57:03] worship he made a beautiful place to
[1:57:04] Worship in fine great Cathedral as they
[1:57:07] call it today he made it right he built
[1:57:09] and put an altar in he wasn't an Infidel
[1:57:12] but able upon the word of God there was
[1:57:14] no Bible wrote
[1:57:17] then but God revealed to him that it
[1:57:20] wasn't fruit that brought us out of the
[1:57:21] garden of Eden Beauty and things doesn't
[1:57:26] enchant
[1:57:28] God it's the sincerity of the Heart by a
[1:57:32] revelation that Jesus Christ has been
[1:57:35] presented as the Son of God our personal
[1:57:46] savior if I just close with this he does
[1:57:48] not
[1:57:49] want a beautiful heart
[1:57:54] he wants your heart exactly the way that
[1:57:57] it is but he wants all of
[1:58:00] it there is not a
[1:58:03] person there is not one single
[1:58:07] person that has presented themsel to God
[1:58:10] that he has turned
[1:58:12] away in the history of
[1:58:15] humanity when somebody gives their all
[1:58:19] and surrenders their all to him he has
[1:58:21] never w one time turn that person
[1:58:24] away there is a Formula there is a way
[1:58:28] it has never changed it's it's it's
[1:58:31] right every time and it's
[1:58:34] simple we just have to do
[1:58:38] it let's bow our
[1:58:41] heads and Lord I just want to ask that
[1:58:43] you
[1:58:45] would Lord that you
[1:58:48] would Lord not just be Lord just in
[1:58:51] words spoken Lord that you would be in
[1:58:53] action
[1:58:54] father Lord that it wouldn't just be a
[1:58:57] good feeling Lord or a good motivation
[1:58:59] Lord that Lord we wouldn't just feel
[1:59:02] Lord the urge to surrender to you Lord
[1:59:04] and then back away from
[1:59:07] it and Lord only you know what's in the
[1:59:10] heart of the individual person Lord what
[1:59:12] they hold from you what they hold back

[1:59:32] know who it's for Lord maybe one person
[1:59:34] but if there's somebody
[1:59:37] Lord who has kept something from

[2:00:17] consuming fire lord a holy
[2:00:19] fire and Lord I know that you're more
[2:00:22] than able and capable Lord of cleansing

[2:01:21] or their or they Lord what they do what
[2:01:24] they see what they act Lord but they
[2:01:26] would have you would have a control over
