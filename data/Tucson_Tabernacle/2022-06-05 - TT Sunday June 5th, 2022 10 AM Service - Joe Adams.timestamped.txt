[40:09] he gave his all

[40:20] if you just share it with us
[40:24] because you were worthy but because he
[40:26] desired so
[40:27] and he said all therefore by doing this
[40:30] i'll make you worthy of it
[40:32] and through his shed blood
[40:34] and of all we have to say the father
[40:36] forgive me

[40:41] appreciate that so much
[40:43] [Music]
[40:44] sometimes surrender is difficult
[40:48] but when you do surrender and god steps
[40:50] in
[40:50] what a change in your life so
[40:53] appreciate we have a couple of requests
[40:55] to bring to your attention
[40:58] sister martha we had
[41:00] prayed for her dad the other day he was
[41:02] going to have a biopsy on the
[41:04] spot on his nose and it did test
[41:06] positive for cancer
[41:08] but it was a mild form
[41:11] and but cancer is no different than any
[41:13] other disease or sickness to god
[41:16] he's the healer of all thy diseases so
[41:20] and sometimes in giving a prayer request
[41:24] and asking for prayer
[41:26] you're saying lord i believe
[41:28] i'm writing this down because i do
[41:30] believe
[41:31] when the saints of god pray you here
[41:34] and it takes an act of faith and god
[41:36] appreciates that he respects that so
[41:39] also
[41:40] we had asked prayer for sister mary
[41:42] ramirez just the other day she was in a
[41:44] lot of pain
[41:46] they took her back to the doctor to
[41:48] look over seems good and they found
[41:50] nothing wrong
[41:52] and brother tony let me know that she is
[41:54] feeling much better
[41:56] again today and
[41:58] um
[41:59] he always writes in his notes
[42:02] and to me especially and he says
[42:04] don't get older it's no fun
[42:08] but there's a promise of eternal life
[42:11] and that's where we stand up so
[42:13] keeping them in prayer
[42:14] also sister rebeccas and brennan had
[42:17] asked
[42:18] prayer for a
[42:20] trip she's going to be taking traveling
[42:21] mercies and also a situation at work so
[42:26] if you'll stand with me brother dan
[42:28] evans would you come and
[42:31] take these requests if you have a
[42:32] request and you would say lord
[42:35] sometimes sometimes we can't put it in
[42:37] words but god knows our hearts so
[42:41] just believe that again thank you
[42:45] let's pray
[42:47] heavenly father as
[42:50] we raise our hands lord knowing that
[42:53] there is a father there that sees the
[42:56] raised hands and lord as brother ann
[42:59] mentioned as these prayer requests were
[43:00] written down upon paper they were
[43:02] written knowing that there is a god
[43:05] that sees these requests and that is
[43:07] able to answer
[43:10] almighty god the one that created the
[43:12] heavens and the earth you are there for
[43:14] our requests and
[43:16] lord we humbly bring them up before you
[43:19] and ask
[43:20] lord that you'd hear us and
[43:22] father that you would answer in in your
[43:24] perfect way
[43:26] father
[43:28] thank you that there is a god and we
[43:30] know there is a god that does answer
[43:33] prayer

[44:40] and i just i didn't have a lot of
[44:43] interaction with her in the sense of
[44:46] thing but whenever i saw her and never
[44:48] we greeted one another there was such a
[44:50] sweetness about her
[44:52] a smile in her face and even in her eyes
[44:54] it just glowed out of her and and it was
[44:56] genuine it was just just thinking about
[44:59] that the other day in the times that we
[45:01] were so

[48:40] time with them and our condolences go
[48:42] out to you sister baggett from the loss

[48:46] meet with her a couple months ago and
[48:47] have dinner and just the stories after
[48:50] stories after story so you know we mourn
[48:53] the loss on this side right but we would
[48:55] never call them back to this life
[48:58] because now in a new body a well body
[49:01] rejoicing running on the streets made
[49:03] with gold and everything that she
[49:05] believed and trusted and hoped for now
[49:07] it's a reality and one day soon it's
[49:09] going to be our reality one day soon
[49:12] each of us are going to you know
[49:13] transfer over to that portal hopefully
[49:15] lord willing to be a body change the
[49:17] rapture of the church and we'll be able
[49:19] to meet again and see our loved ones but
[49:21] until that time we're going to keep
[49:22] pressing the battle on this side
[49:25] uh this morning yes musicians i don't
[49:27] have a special don't worry
[49:30] this morning i do want to speak to you
[49:32] uh on something that
[49:34] i'd studied out probably a couple of
[49:36] months ago and uh you know as you pray
[49:39] for services what how the lord would
[49:40] direct how the lord willing just kind of
[49:42] really felt the leadership to speak this
[49:44] this morning this would be a service
[49:46] that we want to if we give it a title
[49:47] it's called call to arms
[49:50] call to arms and not sure if any of you
[49:52] know but tomorrow is d-day
[49:56] so today is the eve of d-day where the
[49:59] troops are making preparation for what
[50:01] would be the largest amphibious military
[50:04] assault in history and today is the eve
[50:07] of that day and i just was sitting back
[50:10] there and i looked at that thought and
[50:11] i'm thinking and you're having me to
[50:13] speak on call to arms and so by the
[50:15] grace of god we're going to look at this
[50:17] this morning
[50:18] i have two parts of this service but i
[50:20] don't feel led to speak the second part
[50:22] what i like to do this evening is to
[50:24] speak to the young people
[50:26] i know that there may not be a whole lot
[50:28] of young people here this morning but if
[50:30] you would go out in the hedges highways
[50:32] byways bring the young people and
[50:34] encourage your young people to come back
[50:36] for service this evening and i'll have a
[50:38] thought on my heart the lord laid it
[50:39] upon me earlier this week said i want
[50:41] you to take us an evening service and i
[50:43] want you to direct that toward the youth
[50:45] of
[50:46] tucson tabernacle so by the grace of god
[50:48] we'll do that this evening so it doesn't
[50:50] let you over the folks off the hook
[50:52] no we're all young people right
[50:54] 18
[50:56] in a 60 year old body 18 and a 80 year
[50:58] old body 18 and a 45 year old body some
[51:02] of you yeah amen that's right so
[51:04] everybody come back but i just want to
[51:06] kind of direct this to the young people
[51:07] but okay so now we'll just look here in
[51:10] our bibles first chronicles
[51:12] 12 we're going to look here in verse 1.
[51:14] it's a short scripture reading this
[51:16] morning as we're going to kind of gain
[51:18] our
[51:19] our foundation for the service this
[51:21] morning
[51:23] says now these are they that came to
[51:26] david in ziklag
[51:28] while he yet kept himself close because
[51:30] saul the son of kish and they were among
[51:34] the mighty men helpers of war and it
[51:36] goes down verse 2 they were armed with
[51:39] bows and can use both the right hand and
[51:41] the left hand
[51:42] and hurling stones and shooting arrows
[51:45] out of the bow even of saul's brethren
[51:48] of benjamin and then skip down to verse
[51:50] 8
[51:51] because it just goes and it tells all
[51:53] the names of the mighty men of the
[51:55] gibeonites and it says
[51:56] and of the gadis they're separated
[51:58] themselves unto david into the whole to
[52:01] the witness men of might
[52:03] and men
[52:04] of war fit for the battle notice the
[52:07] type of people that were gathering
[52:08] themselves around david these were not
[52:12] lazy people these were not loafers these
[52:14] were men of might men fit for war men
[52:18] capable to do battle and it says they
[52:20] could handle the shield and a buckler
[52:23] whose faces were like faces of lions and
[52:25] who were as swift as rose upon the
[52:28] mountains god bless you you can have
[52:30] your seats this morning and as i said i
[52:32] want to speak to you on this little
[52:34] thought on call to arms
[52:36] and this phrase here called to arms it
[52:38] means a summons it's an invitation
[52:42] it's an appeal to undertake a particular
[52:44] course of action
[52:46] so this morning by the grace of god
[52:47] we're going to kind of look into that
[52:49] because i want to appeal to you to take
[52:51] a particular course of action
[52:54] now how many of you familiar with
[52:55] winston churchill
[52:57] winston churchill i had several quotes
[52:59] here that i'm just going to read because
[53:01] to me he's just a very very very uh
[53:03] unique individual he said i like a man
[53:06] who grins when he fights
[53:08] could you imagine fighting somebody
[53:10] who's smiling at you he's enjoying
[53:12] everything he's doing and he would say
[53:15] you may have to fight when there is no
[53:17] hope of victory
[53:19] because it is better to perish than to
[53:21] live as slaves
[53:24] now if we as sons and daughters of god
[53:27] can just let that quote resonate in our
[53:29] in our minds it's better to fight
[53:32] than live
[53:34] as slaves to the enemy he would also say
[53:37] there is at least one thing worse than
[53:39] fight with the allies and that's to
[53:40] fight without them
[53:42] and the final quote of winston
[53:44] churchill's he says we shall go forward
[53:46] together the road upwards is stony and
[53:49] they're upon our journey dark and
[53:51] dangerous valleys through which we have
[53:53] to make and fight our way but it is sure
[53:56] and certain that if we persevere and we
[54:00] shall persevere we shall come through
[54:03] these dark and dangerous valleys into a
[54:05] sunlight broader and more genuine and
[54:08] more lasting than mankind
[54:10] has ever known
[54:12] now i want you to apply that to the
[54:13] tabernacle apply that to where we are
[54:15] where you are as a church as a body the
[54:18] road forward we're going to go through
[54:20] it together the road forward it's going
[54:22] to be stony it's gonna be dark it's
[54:24] gonna be dangerous valleys but he says
[54:26] it's for certain that we're gonna
[54:27] persevere and we shall and we shall come
[54:30] through the dark and dangerous valleys
[54:33] into a sunlight broader and more genuine
[54:36] and more lasting than mankind
[54:39] has ever known
[54:42] amen that's just wonderful
[54:44] you know there's a hope there's a
[54:45] there's a hope for the church
[54:47] it's not always going to be the way it
[54:49] is currently right
[54:51] i think we have to keep our eyes and
[54:52] keep our minds focused on that that
[54:55] right now what we feel right now what we
[54:57] see right now how it is is not our
[54:59] permanent situation it's just a dark
[55:01] valley it's just a road that we're on
[55:03] but we're going to come into a sunlight
[55:05] a sunlight broader and more genuine and
[55:08] more lasting
[55:10] than the world has ever known so we're
[55:11] going to find our backdrop for this
[55:13] morning scripture we'll find it in first
[55:15] samuel is eight it says nevertheless
[55:17] verse 19. nevertheless the people
[55:19] refused to obey the voice of samuel
[55:22] and they said nay
[55:23] but we will have a king over us so why
[55:25] do we find david
[55:27] garrison and men starting to gravitate
[55:29] or gravitate to david because we look
[55:32] here in 1st samuel 8 and verse 19 the
[55:35] people refused to obey the voice of
[55:37] samuel and they said naba we will have a
[55:40] king over us
[55:42] that we may also be like all the nations
[55:45] and that our king may judge us and go
[55:47] out before us and fight our battles
[55:51] the prophet of god will tell us in the
[55:53] message to reject the king he said it
[55:55] was a time that as in all times that the
[55:58] people has never wanted god to lead them
[56:02] they want their own leadership
[56:05] look church that spirit's still here
[56:09] they don't want the leadership of the
[56:10] holy spirit they want the leadership of
[56:13] a man
[56:15] he says but the people had come to a
[56:16] place where they they wanted to change
[56:19] this program the program of god having a
[56:22] prophet who would lead his people
[56:24] and they had looked upon the philistines
[56:26] in the malachis and the amorites and the
[56:28] hittites in all the nations of the world
[56:31] and they had seen that they had kings
[56:33] that ruled them and governed them and
[56:35] guided them and fought their battles and
[56:37] so forth and this seemed to be that
[56:40] israel wanted to pattern themselves like
[56:43] these kings and like these people
[56:46] if you notice when joshua was given a
[56:48] commission to go into the promised land
[56:50] that he was told to go in and destroy
[56:52] the philistines destroy the amalekites
[56:55] restore the amorites destroy the
[56:57] hittites destroy everything and now we
[57:00] find that instead of destroying all of
[57:02] them they cohabitated with them in so
[57:04] much that now they want to emulate their
[57:07] program
[57:10] and when we come out of denominations we
[57:12] were told to be you separate saith the
[57:14] lord
[57:15] but we find there's a spirit that's
[57:17] coming back into the ranks of the
[57:19] message where now we want somebody to
[57:22] rule over us
[57:25] just bear with me this morning we'll get
[57:27] through this
[57:28] first samuel 8
[57:30] verse 1. now this is where it all
[57:32] gravitates from right here now we
[57:34] believe samuel was a man of god he was
[57:36] called to god he was a great prophet and
[57:38] it says and it came to pass when samuel
[57:40] was old and he made his son judges over
[57:43] israel now the name of the firstborn was
[57:46] joel in the name of the second was
[57:47] abbaya and they were judges in beersheba
[57:50] and his sons walk not in his ways
[57:55] just because you're a son of a prophet
[57:57] doesn't mean you're automatically
[57:58] guaranteed
[58:01] to follow the heritage of that prophet
[58:03] right
[58:05] these people had enough sense to believe
[58:07] that
[58:08] they had enough sense to realize that
[58:10] samuel your sons are not following the
[58:12] way that you are they don't believe the
[58:14] way that you believe it said but they
[58:16] turned aside after luker and they took
[58:18] bribes and they perverted judgment
[58:21] so they were doing things for their own
[58:24] ill gain and not following the standards
[58:27] and the statutes that this prophet
[58:29] samuel had set in place for the children
[58:31] of israel then all the elders of israel
[58:34] gathered themselves together and they
[58:35] came to samuel and rhema and they said
[58:38] unto him behold thou art old and their
[58:40] sons walk not in thy ways now make us a
[58:43] king to judge us like the nations
[58:46] see they looked at samuel they their
[58:48] eyes were on a man and they were looking
[58:50] at that man and they were not looking at
[58:52] the god who was leading that man but
[58:54] they were looking at that man and said
[58:56] there's no succession
[58:59] therefore make us a king
[59:01] see but if they would have been
[59:02] following the prophet they would have
[59:04] been following god through the prophet
[59:06] they knew that no matter what samuel if
[59:08] he died and went to the grave god was
[59:11] going to raise somebody else up because
[59:13] god's ordained way was for god to lead
[59:16] his children not man to lead his
[59:19] children
[59:21] the prophet of god will tell us this he
[59:23] says now and they said samuel your boys
[59:25] is not like you so we want you to go out
[59:27] and find us a king and anoint him and
[59:29] make us a people like the rest of the
[59:32] peoples of the world
[59:35] make us a people we want to be a church
[59:37] like the first baptist church of tucson
[59:41] you're not called
[59:42] to be that
[59:44] he said if you do that notice samuel
[59:46] begins to tell him if you do that the
[59:48] first thing you know
[59:49] is that he will call your sons from your
[59:52] home and make soldiers out of them and
[59:54] you go on and you can read down through
[59:56] first samuel eight but i'm gonna
[59:57] paraphrase it through the quote here and
[59:59] he tells what they're going to do he'll
[1:00:00] take your sons he'll take your daughters
[1:00:02] he'll make him this he'll make them that
[1:00:04] and do this he's going to have lordship
[1:00:06] over your people
[1:00:10] and they were never to have lordship
[1:00:12] over he says in the first thing you know
[1:00:15] that you'll find that he will call your
[1:00:17] sons from your home make soldiers out of
[1:00:19] them to run before his chariots and bear
[1:00:21] armors and spears and not only that but
[1:00:23] he will call your dollars to make bakers
[1:00:24] and bread and take them
[1:00:27] from from you to feed the army and
[1:00:29] besides that he'll take certain taxes
[1:00:31] off of you of your grain and all of your
[1:00:33] enemies and he will tax all that that to
[1:00:35] make certain government debts and so
[1:00:37] forth that had to be paid he's just he
[1:00:39] goes now he said i think you are all
[1:00:42] together making a mistake but when the
[1:00:44] people said it when they heard that they
[1:00:46] said but we still want to be like the
[1:00:48] rest of the people
[1:00:51] we still want a king
[1:00:55] now notice god was separating his people
[1:00:57] we are a separated people
[1:01:01] separated
[1:01:03] royal priesthood chosen generation
[1:01:07] that's who we are
[1:01:08] so never let us want to emulate some
[1:01:11] other church
[1:01:13] whether it be a message church whether
[1:01:15] it be a denominational church no matter
[1:01:17] what it may be may our focus be on sons
[1:01:19] of god are led by the spirit of god
[1:01:24] no matter how much samuel tried to
[1:01:26] persuade the people
[1:01:28] continued they went after him day and
[1:01:30] night we want a king
[1:01:34] we have been seven years without a
[1:01:36] pastor we want a king
[1:01:40] samuel you're dying we
[1:01:42] want a king there's nobody else in the
[1:01:45] church to assume the headship we
[1:01:48] want a king
[1:01:51] notice their eyes and their minds and
[1:01:53] everything that they used to make
[1:01:55] judgment with were skewed because they
[1:01:57] were looking at the physical countenance
[1:02:00] of a prophet in his age and a
[1:02:02] deterioration and him soon to be going
[1:02:04] to a grave and it didn't see the
[1:02:06] succession plan but god already had it
[1:02:09] in mind
[1:02:11] so we have to be careful as a body to
[1:02:14] make sure what we're asking for is in
[1:02:16] the will of god
[1:02:18] now i'm not saying that it's not in the
[1:02:20] will of god for this church to have a
[1:02:21] pastor i'm saying it's not in the will
[1:02:23] of god for this church to have the wrong
[1:02:25] pastor
[1:02:28] notice we want a king we want a man we
[1:02:30] want a man that we can say this is our
[1:02:33] god and this and brother baby says that
[1:02:36] has never been the will of god it never
[1:02:39] was the will of god nor ever will be the
[1:02:41] will of god for a man to rule over
[1:02:44] another
[1:02:46] god rules over man god is our ruler our
[1:02:50] king it's very very much a parallel of
[1:02:52] today because that man seems to have
[1:02:55] that same idea they don't seem to be
[1:02:57] able to grasp that god still rules man
[1:03:01] but man instead of man ruling over man
[1:03:05] so it used to be that we would point to
[1:03:07] the denominations
[1:03:09] well you know we would it was easy as
[1:03:10] messes believers we could point back
[1:03:12] well this denomination and that
[1:03:14] denomination but how many of you here
[1:03:16] ever you actually came out of a
[1:03:17] denomination how many of you here were
[1:03:19] just growing up in the message
[1:03:22] probably more hands that grew up in the
[1:03:23] message so no longer can we point it
[1:03:26] back to the denominations now we have to
[1:03:28] look at within our own ranks
[1:03:31] see the message is all that most of us
[1:03:33] has ever heard most of us has ever known
[1:03:35] and yet many churches today they don't
[1:03:38] want to stay with what the prophet of
[1:03:39] god said
[1:03:42] they have their own ideas
[1:03:45] they want to be like the rest of the
[1:03:47] people
[1:03:48] we need a headquarters
[1:03:51] we need somebody to have jurisdiction
[1:03:52] over us
[1:03:54] when we don't have a pastor they can
[1:03:55] send somebody in
[1:03:57] all these things they didn't want to
[1:03:59] accept the way god has ordained it now
[1:04:02] they have an intellectual understanding
[1:04:04] they don't have a god inspired ministry
[1:04:07] they they have their own ideas they have
[1:04:09] their own doctrines they have their own
[1:04:11] circle of influence
[1:04:13] and they feel like well this is it
[1:04:15] but we find that own idea and that own
[1:04:17] circle of influence all it does is
[1:04:19] separates the body
[1:04:21] it separates fellowship
[1:04:24] see
[1:04:25] they don't want to be led by the holy
[1:04:26] spirit
[1:04:28] they have intellectual giants today
[1:04:30] leading them versus the holy spirit
[1:04:32] leading them
[1:04:34] now the prophet of god taught us that
[1:04:36] every church in the pastor and every
[1:04:38] church is the sovereign head of that
[1:04:41] local body
[1:04:43] the pastors are sovereign he don't need
[1:04:45] man ruling over him and furthermore
[1:04:48] the man is the sovereign head of the
[1:04:50] body but every son and daughter of god
[1:04:52] is to be led by the spirit not by the
[1:04:54] man
[1:04:56] so let's make sure we bring a clarity to
[1:04:58] that because the last thing we want is
[1:05:00] to go ahead and prop a pastor up and
[1:05:02] then all of a sudden he tells you where
[1:05:04] you can go eat lunch what car you can
[1:05:06] buy what color it is how big a house you
[1:05:08] can buy and yet these are things that
[1:05:10] are going on within the ranks of the
[1:05:12] message
[1:05:13] you can't go to so-and-so special
[1:05:15] meetings because they don't believe like
[1:05:17] we believe
[1:05:19] they don't
[1:05:21] they don't they don't they don't and
[1:05:22] then we're starting to find that man
[1:05:25] begins to overlord the people versus
[1:05:27] guiding the people
[1:05:30] see they reject and notice now they
[1:05:31] didn't reject these people these
[1:05:33] believers are these
[1:05:35] pastors in these churches
[1:05:37] who have
[1:05:38] kind of gone this route they've not
[1:05:40] rejected
[1:05:41] william branham
[1:05:43] they not rejected a prophet but they
[1:05:45] rejected christ they rejected the holy
[1:05:48] ghost to leave the church now i
[1:05:50] understand this is a little bit
[1:05:51] different type of ministry for me this
[1:05:52] morning because you're used to my
[1:05:54] 100 miles an hour but i just felt like
[1:05:56] really just laying this in here this
[1:05:58] morning see they rejected christ they
[1:06:00] rejected the holy ghost which was sent
[1:06:02] to lead the church
[1:06:04] that was god's ordained method for the
[1:06:08] church to be led was god was going to
[1:06:10] lead the church to the holy spirit
[1:06:12] through a god-ordained pastor who was
[1:06:15] going to be led by the holy spirit and
[1:06:17] the people led by the spirit and then
[1:06:19] you find the continuity between what is
[1:06:21] being ministered and what is being
[1:06:23] received is in tune with what the spirit
[1:06:25] wants so that the church moves forward
[1:06:28] but we find here in first samuel 9 they
[1:06:31] decided they wanted to choose a man and
[1:06:34] god gave them the very desire of their
[1:06:35] heart
[1:06:37] they wanted a man they wanted a king
[1:06:39] they wanted to be like the rest of the
[1:06:40] churches and we find here in first
[1:06:42] samuel 9 and verse 1. now there was a
[1:06:44] man of a benjamin whose name was kish
[1:06:46] the son of abiel the son of zeorh the
[1:06:49] son of becker wrath and the son of hayah
[1:06:52] the benjamin a mighty man of power and
[1:06:54] he had a son whose name was saul notice
[1:06:57] now this is what they're looking at
[1:06:59] a choice young man
[1:07:02] a goodly and there was not among the
[1:07:04] children of israel a goodly a person
[1:07:06] than he from his shoulders and upward he
[1:07:09] was higher than any other people
[1:07:14] he wasn't joe adams at five foot six
[1:07:17] no he was goodly
[1:07:20] he was probably six foot three you know
[1:07:22] all that i aspire to be in life
[1:07:25] man if i could add a cubic i'd add a
[1:07:27] couple cubics
[1:07:28] brother aaron to my stature but
[1:07:31] but we find here they looked at the
[1:07:33] outward appearance
[1:07:35] now god gave them this man because he
[1:07:38] knew in their heart this was what they
[1:07:39] were looking for to lead them they
[1:07:42] wanted someone who looked apart they
[1:07:44] wanted someone who was head and
[1:07:45] shoulders above the rest
[1:07:47] so that when they would say this is our
[1:07:49] king that it would strike fear in the
[1:07:51] other nations because their king stood
[1:07:53] above the rest
[1:07:58] and you have churches today this is my
[1:07:59] pastor
[1:08:01] this is where i go to church
[1:08:05] they're choosing the king after their
[1:08:06] own making
[1:08:08] versus when god is called to lead we
[1:08:11] find now then samuel took a vow of oil
[1:08:13] this is in first samuel 10 and 1 and he
[1:08:14] poured it upon his head and he kissed
[1:08:16] him and he said it is not because the
[1:08:17] lord hath anointed thee to be captain
[1:08:20] over his inheritance and in verse 5 and
[1:08:22] after that thou shalt come to the hill
[1:08:24] of god whereas there is a garrison of
[1:08:26] the philistines and they shall come to
[1:08:28] pass and when thou art come through
[1:08:29] there through the city the thou shall
[1:08:31] meet a company of prophets coming down
[1:08:33] from a high place
[1:08:34] with a sultry and a tablet and a pipe
[1:08:36] and a heart before them and they shall
[1:08:39] prophesy and the spirit of the lord will
[1:08:41] come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy
[1:08:43] with them notice what it says here and
[1:08:46] thou shall be turned into another man
[1:08:50] now i believe this is my personal belief
[1:08:53] that god
[1:08:54] did this and when he did this and allow
[1:08:57] saul to enter in to what would be the
[1:09:01] courts of a prophet or the the anointing
[1:09:03] of a prophet and he prophesied i believe
[1:09:06] in his own mind it elevated himself
[1:09:08] above everybody else
[1:09:11] because it says thou shalt be turned
[1:09:12] into another man and that word another
[1:09:14] there means strange
[1:09:17] he turned into a strange man no doubt
[1:09:20] here he is a peasant he's just a normal
[1:09:23] kid out tending the sheep looking for
[1:09:25] his father's sheep or whatever it was
[1:09:27] that he was looking for the horses or
[1:09:28] the asses or whatever it may be and yet
[1:09:30] he was as normal as any of us here today
[1:09:33] but yet when he was anointed king and
[1:09:36] then he not only was he anointed to be
[1:09:38] king but now he come on with the gift of
[1:09:39] prophecy it changed his whole mindset
[1:09:43] and now he lifted himself up in his own
[1:09:46] thinking
[1:09:48] and if you're not careful church that's
[1:09:49] what we find happens a lot of times god
[1:09:51] will take somebody and rear them up and
[1:09:53] place him behind the pulpit and yet
[1:09:55] because they get their own idea
[1:09:58] and that idea separates them from
[1:10:00] fellowship but what it does it exalts
[1:10:02] them in their own thinking and if
[1:10:04] they're not careful it exhausts them
[1:10:05] within their own local body and now
[1:10:07] they're up here look at my king
[1:10:10] look at my king look at my pastor look
[1:10:14] at man he's preaching something nobody
[1:10:16] else is preaching that should be a red
[1:10:18] flag
[1:10:21] that should be a re he's preaching
[1:10:23] something that nobody else has even
[1:10:26] thought of
[1:10:29] i'm sorry but we had a prophet
[1:10:32] there's nothing else that can be
[1:10:33] preached outside of the rims of this
[1:10:36] prophetic ministry that we've received
[1:10:38] otherwise he would still be on the scene
[1:10:41] revealing the mysteries revealing the
[1:10:43] the things that we have need of to carry
[1:10:46] us into a rapture
[1:10:47] but he said the only time that i will
[1:10:49] ever preach is when i'm mortal and god
[1:10:52] will not take me but when he's
[1:10:54] completely done with me with any man
[1:10:58] and so we find these men now have
[1:11:01] elevated themselves up they become
[1:11:03] strange
[1:11:06] see saul brother battle would say in
[1:11:07] demonology saul was considered one of
[1:11:10] the
[1:11:10] prophets think about the stigma that
[1:11:13] comes with that the status the prestige
[1:11:19] man you could gather people when you
[1:11:21] become one of the prophets
[1:11:23] you can gather people when you got some
[1:11:26] thought that nobody else is preaching
[1:11:28] and it begins to elevate elevate elevate
[1:11:31] elevate elevate and it's elevating the
[1:11:33] man it's not elevating christ
[1:11:36] it's building a kingdom
[1:11:38] not restoring the kingdom
[1:11:42] he says here in the rejected king see
[1:11:44] now
[1:11:45] the people does not seem to be satisfied
[1:11:48] with the way that god placed his church
[1:11:50] to be governed and to be controlled by
[1:11:52] the holy spirit
[1:11:54] they want somebody some man some
[1:11:56] denomination
[1:11:58] some certain people to govern the church
[1:12:00] that they will be able to throw so that
[1:12:02] they will not be able to throw
[1:12:04] themselves completely into god's hands
[1:12:06] to be spiritual to be led by the holy
[1:12:08] spirit they want somebody to do their
[1:12:11] religion for them somebody that would
[1:12:13] tell them just how to do it and all
[1:12:14] about it so this man seemed to suit the
[1:12:17] place exactly because he was very
[1:12:20] intellectual
[1:12:24] and a whole he said and it's a whole lot
[1:12:27] like today
[1:12:29] see we like to choose such people now if
[1:12:31] you want to find this quote this is in
[1:12:34] the rejected king paragraph 51
[1:12:37] so you can make sure that what i'm
[1:12:38] preaching to you is from the message of
[1:12:40] the hour
[1:12:42] he says now we like to choose such a
[1:12:43] people too to control our churches
[1:12:45] control the church of god not that i
[1:12:47] have to say against it but just merely
[1:12:49] to make a point that this is not it was
[1:12:52] not it never will be the will of god for
[1:12:55] such to be god is to rule the people to
[1:12:57] govern each individual
[1:13:00] that's god's leadership but we find in
[1:13:03] the first church age brother bannon was
[1:13:06] saying the first age there came a
[1:13:07] strange doctrine that creeped into the
[1:13:10] church
[1:13:12] and that was a doctrine of the
[1:13:13] nicolaitanism
[1:13:15] now this word that was in revelations 2
[1:13:17] 6 but thou has thou hateth the deeds of
[1:13:19] the nicholas's which i also hate and
[1:13:22] when you look up what the word
[1:13:24] nicolaitan means in the third definition
[1:13:27] it means destruction of the people
[1:13:31] so the doctrine the deeds of the
[1:13:32] nicolaitanism was not to elevate the
[1:13:35] people was not to edify the people it
[1:13:37] was not to build up the body of christ
[1:13:39] but it was to for the destruction of the
[1:13:42] local church
[1:13:45] and he says now if you read acts 2 4 the
[1:13:48] way that some do you can read it this
[1:13:50] way
[1:13:51] now listen how he reads it
[1:13:53] now when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:13:55] come there came a priest with a wafer
[1:13:57] and he said stick out your tongue
[1:14:01] we want to have communion this morning
[1:14:03] i'll come on we'll say stick out your
[1:14:04] tongue and we'll place a wafer on your
[1:14:07] tongue this is what he's saying stick
[1:14:09] out your tongue and he placed a wafer
[1:14:11] upon it and him and he himself drank
[1:14:13] some wine notice he'd only give you the
[1:14:15] opportunity to drink the wine
[1:14:17] he himself drank the wine and said now
[1:14:18] you've received the holy ghost
[1:14:21] now you have received the holy ghost he
[1:14:24] said that's exactly what nicotine
[1:14:26] nicolaitanism has come see they say
[1:14:29] never mind the word of god
[1:14:32] you can't understand it we have to
[1:14:34] interpret it for you
[1:14:39] we have to be we're the great spiritual
[1:14:41] ones we're the ministry we have to be
[1:14:45] able to explain it
[1:14:47] for you and interpret it for you
[1:14:49] furthermore the bible they say the bible
[1:14:51] is not finished it has to change with
[1:14:53] the times and we will tell you what
[1:14:56] those changes are
[1:14:59] how contrary that is to the word of god
[1:15:01] that emphatically states let god's word
[1:15:04] be true and every man's word be a lie
[1:15:08] so church it behooves us to discern the
[1:15:11] spirit within the church
[1:15:15] see he says he says now so the people
[1:15:18] are led by people who presume
[1:15:21] to be what they are not they say that
[1:15:23] they are vikers of christ but what they
[1:15:25] are is the antichrist now i'm not
[1:15:28] calling anybody antichrist but what i'm
[1:15:30] saying is
[1:15:30] i'm telling you to discern the spirit
[1:15:33] for what we see then you're seeing it
[1:15:36] repeat today
[1:15:39] you're seeing it repeat today
[1:15:42] god takes this man but he leaves his
[1:15:44] spirit
[1:15:45] satan takes his man
[1:15:47] but his spirit remains behind
[1:15:50] so nico nicolaitanism destroys those
[1:15:53] precepts and instead separates the
[1:15:56] ministers from the people and makes them
[1:15:58] leaders overlords instead of servants
[1:16:03] see saul became an overlord he began to
[1:16:06] dictate what this one did and that one
[1:16:08] did and this one in that one and he
[1:16:09] wasn't a servant
[1:16:12] but that was what the people wanted now
[1:16:15] notice a pastor if we would call it this
[1:16:17] in this aspect he's a shepherd he's not
[1:16:20] an overlord he's a he's a shepherd he is
[1:16:23] to smell like the sheep
[1:16:25] he is to live with the sheep he is to
[1:16:28] eat with the sheep he is to sleep with
[1:16:30] the sheep the bible will say he's the
[1:16:32] gatekeeper
[1:16:34] therefore he lays within the gate the
[1:16:37] open door the gate there he lays within
[1:16:40] it and there's no sheep that can get out
[1:16:42] but what he first comes across the
[1:16:44] shepherd
[1:16:45] and there's no wolf that can get in but
[1:16:47] what at first has to come through the
[1:16:49] shepherd who is the gate to the
[1:16:51] sheephole what am i telling you i'm
[1:16:53] telling you that the holy ghost is the
[1:16:56] gate to the sheepfold there's no false
[1:16:58] teaching that can come through the
[1:17:00] church as long as a church is being led
[1:17:03] by the holy ghost
[1:17:06] and no can they pull any of the sheep
[1:17:08] out
[1:17:09] because the holy ghost is there to
[1:17:11] protect
[1:17:13] and a god called pastor an anointed man
[1:17:16] who knows that that's his position and
[1:17:18] he knows that he is following the spirit
[1:17:21] of god he is protecting the sheep he is
[1:17:24] protecting from false teachings he is
[1:17:28] protecting from man's ideas that begin
[1:17:30] to pull on people and entice people in
[1:17:33] poor people see he is not to be an
[1:17:36] overlord of the sheep
[1:17:38] he is not to fleece the sheep for his
[1:17:41] own ill gain but he is to provide for
[1:17:44] the sheep
[1:17:45] he is to guide the sheep
[1:17:47] he is to protect the sheep
[1:17:50] and he is to serve
[1:17:52] the sheep
[1:17:54] but nicotia nicolaitanism which is the
[1:17:57] organizing of human government within
[1:17:59] the church
[1:18:01] notice organizing human government
[1:18:03] within the church
[1:18:06] to legislate the people
[1:18:08] we have to be careful especially in a
[1:18:10] church who does not have a pastor that
[1:18:13] you got god called men who are still
[1:18:16] leading the church
[1:18:18] not legislators
[1:18:20] not overlords
[1:18:22] you got deacons who are god inspired god
[1:18:25] called deacons who are in harmony one
[1:18:27] with another who says i can't wait to
[1:18:30] let go of the reigns of the church when
[1:18:32] god sends us a godly man because the
[1:18:35] reigns will never be intended for man to
[1:18:37] hold on to it and yet it know we know
[1:18:40] that it takes man to keep things
[1:18:41] together but what we're saying here if
[1:18:44] there's no uh negotiation where is a
[1:18:47] human government we don't want human
[1:18:48] governments within the body of the
[1:18:50] church we want sons of god feel led to
[1:18:53] be led by the spirit of god
[1:18:56] now within order keep everything within
[1:18:58] church order everything in life deacons
[1:19:01] in their role trustees and narrow the
[1:19:03] ministry of ministries in their role and
[1:19:05] the people in their role and as long as
[1:19:07] we stay in our prospective roles god can
[1:19:10] add and god can lead the church
[1:19:14] so we must work together and we must
[1:19:16] discern any spirit
[1:19:18] of nicotinicism
[1:19:20] which is a denominational spirit that
[1:19:22] tries to work within the framework of
[1:19:24] the church
[1:19:26] and we find today man
[1:19:29] and when i say we find today when i say
[1:19:31] little phrases like that i'm not
[1:19:33] speaking to the nominations
[1:19:35] i come out of denominations 20 plus
[1:19:37] years ago
[1:19:38] i'm not speaking about that i'm speaking
[1:19:40] about within the ranks of what we
[1:19:42] believe as the message of the hour
[1:19:44] we find man today that wants to control
[1:19:47] others
[1:19:49] when you have people
[1:19:50] writing to a headquarters who shall i
[1:19:55] marry
[1:19:56] well whoever your heart falls in love
[1:19:58] with
[1:20:00] no they're getting permission
[1:20:04] who shall i marry where should i move my
[1:20:07] family
[1:20:08] where can i go to church
[1:20:12] and they're writing a headquarters god
[1:20:14] never intended for his body to write
[1:20:17] headquarters to try to get direction he
[1:20:20] is the headquarters
[1:20:22] sons of god are led by the spirit you
[1:20:25] pray about that and you fall on your
[1:20:27] knees and you begin to seek god and say
[1:20:29] god i need your leadership god i need
[1:20:32] your action i need your direction in my
[1:20:34] life i need to know where you want me to
[1:20:36] go i need to know where you want me to
[1:20:38] uproot my family and place them so that
[1:20:40] we can grow in the admonition of god
[1:20:42] where we can be plugged into a local
[1:20:43] assembly god i want to be led i don't
[1:20:46] want to have to go ask permission
[1:20:49] but we find
[1:20:52] that's the case
[1:20:53] in a lot of churches today that's the
[1:20:55] case with a lot of believers today
[1:20:56] that's the case they'll tell you what
[1:20:58] tape
[1:20:59] that you must play at what time you must
[1:21:02] push play
[1:21:04] don't get quiet on me it's okay i know
[1:21:06] where i'm standing
[1:21:09] you got to listen to a certain sermon at
[1:21:11] a certain time
[1:21:15] but what about god inspired preaching
[1:21:19] what about preaching that comes down and
[1:21:22] god knows you've been dealing with the
[1:21:23] situation and god's bringing somebody in
[1:21:26] that can minister to that need
[1:21:28] particularly to your need what about
[1:21:31] that
[1:21:33] there's nothing wrong with push and play
[1:21:34] i push play on the way here i push play
[1:21:37] on the plane i push play in the airport
[1:21:40] i push play when i'm in my studies
[1:21:42] studying i pushed play when i'm at the
[1:21:43] gym working out i pushed play when i
[1:21:45] worked at the hospital i pushed play but
[1:21:48] i'm not here today to push play i'm here
[1:21:50] to preach the inspired word of god
[1:21:53] because that's god's ordained way
[1:21:57] don't call headship don't call
[1:21:59] headquarters
[1:22:02] you should already caught on
[1:22:03] headquarters before you came you should
[1:22:04] have been in prayer
[1:22:07] notice now
[1:22:09] they want to tell you some churches want
[1:22:11] to tell you who you can and who you
[1:22:12] can't fellowship with
[1:22:16] you can't fellowship with this group
[1:22:18] and they don't fellowship with this
[1:22:20] group
[1:22:21] and none of their people fellowship with
[1:22:23] this group
[1:22:25] i don't know church but that doesn't
[1:22:26] seem to be the spirit of christ to me
[1:22:29] you know what the prophet of god was a
[1:22:31] prime example of being able to cross
[1:22:34] denominational barriers
[1:22:36] the man one of his best friends was a
[1:22:38] rank center bert call
[1:22:41] and yet he saw fit to go hunting sleep
[1:22:44] with the man in a tent
[1:22:47] and
[1:22:47] day after day after day he didn't dis
[1:22:50] fellowship him because he wasn't a
[1:22:52] believer
[1:22:53] but our attitudes i wonder sometimes
[1:22:55] that we have gotten so high and mighty
[1:22:57] so lifted up so self-righteous that we
[1:23:00] can't even fellowship with one another
[1:23:02] and i don't say it's our fault i believe
[1:23:04] it's because the leadership now begins
[1:23:06] to push these things on the people and
[1:23:08] the people don't know what to believe
[1:23:10] and the these pastors are holding the
[1:23:12] people by fear
[1:23:16] pastors are not overlords
[1:23:18] they're servants
[1:23:20] brother says now this is in the message
[1:23:22] the sermon of the spirit he says take
[1:23:24] your choice but then don't never
[1:23:26] disfellowship the other man because he
[1:23:29] don't belong with your group
[1:23:32] just so you know that's a 1960 message
[1:23:34] it's past the 50s i know it's three
[1:23:36] years before the seals but nevertheless
[1:23:38] he was a prophet before the seals he was
[1:23:40] a prophet after the seals you either
[1:23:41] believe the word or you don't believe
[1:23:43] the word
[1:23:44] notice what he says notice don't never
[1:23:48] disfellowship the other man because he
[1:23:50] don't belong with your group
[1:23:54] discern his spirit and see if he's got
[1:23:56] the same purpose in heart
[1:23:58] then you got fellowship one with another
[1:24:00] you're working for one great cause
[1:24:02] that's the cause of christ i think
[1:24:04] that's absolutely true
[1:24:06] but man do they want to tell you who you
[1:24:08] can who you can't listen to
[1:24:11] and if you go somewhere else and hear
[1:24:13] somebody else
[1:24:15] then you're committing spiritual
[1:24:16] adultery
[1:24:19] come on church
[1:24:21] we don't believe this do we
[1:24:25] i've told people in the past that i was
[1:24:27] coming to tucson tabernacle to preach
[1:24:30] sorry i can't come
[1:24:33] i'm like shame on you and shame on the
[1:24:36] leadership
[1:24:40] i haven't seen you in two years and you
[1:24:41] can't come and hear me preach because of
[1:24:44] some leadership
[1:24:46] men are afraid if somebody's got
[1:24:48] something to say that's going to hold
[1:24:50] the people
[1:24:51] in my my mind if you got something to
[1:24:54] say and god's called you for that you
[1:24:55] ain't got to worry about losing sheep
[1:24:57] because you can't feed them no if you
[1:24:59] got something to feed them fear is never
[1:25:00] going to hold permanently
[1:25:04] understand fear will never hold
[1:25:06] permanently eventually the fear will be
[1:25:09] broken off and people will come out but
[1:25:12] if you want to hold people you want to
[1:25:14] keep your congregation feed them the
[1:25:15] word of god preach them the power of the
[1:25:18] holy spirit preach in the dynamics of
[1:25:20] the mess of the hour preach them a
[1:25:21] living god don't put no dead painted
[1:25:24] pitcher or some fire painted fire up
[1:25:26] there and expect them to get worn by
[1:25:28] preach them a living god preach them
[1:25:30] signs and wonders preach in the
[1:25:31] supernatural and you'll see god
[1:25:33] vindicate and you'll see people
[1:25:35] gravitate to it
[1:25:37] don't be an overlord be a servant to the
[1:25:39] people gather the people in by the word
[1:25:42] of god
[1:25:46] notice this is nothing more than a
[1:25:48] spirit
[1:25:49] of nicolaitism
[1:25:51] denominationalism
[1:25:53] hold people by fear
[1:25:55] versus letting them go
[1:25:58] that's one thing my pastor has never
[1:25:59] done he never said joe you can't go here
[1:26:02] you can't go here you can't go here you
[1:26:04] can go here
[1:26:05] now since i decided to go full time or
[1:26:08] not i decided god led me to go full time
[1:26:10] we've had invitation after invitation
[1:26:12] we're booked out all the way to october
[1:26:14] beyond my wildest dreams never once that
[1:26:17] i had to call my pastor and say can i
[1:26:19] get your permission to go to these
[1:26:21] meetings
[1:26:23] no
[1:26:24] because i'm led by the spirit of god
[1:26:27] god led me to take that invitation
[1:26:30] now if there was an emergency in the
[1:26:32] church and i went and the pastor said
[1:26:34] look i would wish that you would may
[1:26:35] reschedule yes that's a different
[1:26:37] situation
[1:26:39] so now
[1:26:40] brother man says now let this go real
[1:26:42] deep is this okay this morning
[1:26:44] a little bit different but i hope it
[1:26:46] just settles into you this morning let
[1:26:48] me see how much time i got plenty of
[1:26:50] time don't don't walk out on me just yet
[1:26:53] but he says let this go real deep under
[1:26:55] the fifth rib on the left side
[1:26:59] left side
[1:27:01] when a man is anointed with the spirit
[1:27:04] of god his habits his actions and
[1:27:07] everything is god moving in him
[1:27:11] and he says sometimes he's misjudged
[1:27:16] people want to stream into our services
[1:27:18] brother aaron and they misjudge our
[1:27:20] services because of the freedom that's
[1:27:23] within our church
[1:27:25] but every action
[1:27:27] every moving
[1:27:29] is of the holy spirit there's nothing
[1:27:32] out of line
[1:27:35] he says now when a man is anointed of
[1:27:39] the spirit of god this is in discernment
[1:27:41] of the spirit paragraph 41
[1:27:43] he's got the action of god and the
[1:27:46] action of god is to never break us up
[1:27:50] the action of god is to never break us
[1:27:54] up it's never to this fellowship
[1:27:59] so when you find man who's throwing
[1:28:01] bombs and causing divides
[1:28:04] discern the spirit
[1:28:06] that can't be the spirit of our lords
[1:28:08] and what i'm telling you this morning
[1:28:11] though it's on the auspice of the
[1:28:12] message though he has a great following
[1:28:15] though he may seem to have inspired
[1:28:17] messages
[1:28:19] discern the spirit of the man
[1:28:24] he says now it's never to break us up
[1:28:25] the action of god is to draw us together
[1:28:28] for we are one in christ jesus and god's
[1:28:32] purpose is to bring us together
[1:28:35] to love one another
[1:28:39] and this ain't some sixties
[1:28:41] song either this is really a prophet of
[1:28:44] god telling us that perfect love is the
[1:28:46] only thing that'll enter in
[1:28:49] and how can you have perfect love when
[1:28:50] you're causing division
[1:28:52] how can we have perfect love when we
[1:28:53] won't allow ourselves to fellowship
[1:28:55] because maybe you see something i don't
[1:28:57] see or maybe you see something
[1:28:58] completely an error
[1:29:00] maybe god sends you to fix that one and
[1:29:03] or maybe use you to bring that one out
[1:29:05] of the era but because of the boundaries
[1:29:07] and because of the preaching because of
[1:29:09] what's been stipulated out there that
[1:29:10] you can't have fellowship now we pull
[1:29:12] back and we just stay with our little
[1:29:14] group
[1:29:15] that's not god's intentions
[1:29:17] see men today they're not satisfied
[1:29:19] brother aaron with the way god ordained
[1:29:22] his church
[1:29:24] god started his church the way he wanted
[1:29:26] it
[1:29:28] he's going to finish his church the way
[1:29:29] he started it
[1:29:31] now how do we find that church i'm glad
[1:29:33] you asked turn your bibles ephesians 4
[1:29:34] and verse 9.
[1:29:37] because i know y'all had questions in
[1:29:38] your mind well brother joe how did he
[1:29:40] start the church
[1:29:43] there was no recorded devices
[1:29:45] there was no magnetic tapes
[1:29:48] there was no cds there was no dvds
[1:29:52] there was none of these things back in
[1:29:53] that day
[1:29:55] they may have had pappas
[1:29:57] and some kind of ink and they wrote
[1:29:59] things down but listen what the listen
[1:30:00] what he says here in ephesians and this
[1:30:02] is paul first church age messenger now
[1:30:04] that he ascended this is verse 9 now
[1:30:07] that he ascended what is he but or what
[1:30:10] is but that he also descended first into
[1:30:13] the lower parts of the earth he that
[1:30:15] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:30:18] up far above all heavens that he might
[1:30:20] fill all things and he gave some
[1:30:25] apostles he didn't even put the prophet
[1:30:28] in the first in the first place
[1:30:30] notice we he gave some apostles and some
[1:30:34] prophets and some evangelists
[1:30:36] and some pastors and teachers
[1:30:40] now there is an s behind every one of
[1:30:43] those
[1:30:46] not one standalone
[1:30:48] apostle
[1:30:50] who's going to live for eternity on
[1:30:52] earth and set up every church that's
[1:30:53] been known to man there's not one
[1:30:55] standalone prophet
[1:30:58] but we believe we've see we received a
[1:31:00] major prophet in this hour and there
[1:31:02] will not be another major prophet
[1:31:05] but the gift of prophecy still works
[1:31:07] within the body or this scripture is
[1:31:10] wrong
[1:31:11] notice the gift of evangelist
[1:31:14] an s
[1:31:17] pastors
[1:31:18] s
[1:31:19] teachers with an s for what for the
[1:31:22] perfecting of the saints
[1:31:26] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:31:27] edifying of the body of christ till we
[1:31:30] all come into the unity of the faith in
[1:31:33] the knowledge of the son of man or son
[1:31:35] of god unto a perfect man unto the
[1:31:38] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:31:39] of christ
[1:31:40] see god ordained this way
[1:31:46] now out here in arizona you probably got
[1:31:48] more tape churches than they have any
[1:31:50] other state
[1:31:52] and i'm not bashing tape churches
[1:31:54] but i'm pointing you back to the
[1:31:55] scripture
[1:31:57] god ordained this method
[1:31:59] god look
[1:32:01] god ordained this
[1:32:03] you can have the prophet ministry
[1:32:06] in your home in your car on your job
[1:32:10] in your quiet time
[1:32:11] you have that it set your your
[1:32:14] possession over 1200 sermons on a little
[1:32:16] discard you can place push play anytime
[1:32:18] you want but you can also have
[1:32:20] evangelists you can also have pastors
[1:32:23] you can also have teachers and you can
[1:32:26] also have apostles
[1:32:28] because all of these is what edifies the
[1:32:31] body
[1:32:32] not any singular gift
[1:32:34] so what we're preaching on today is the
[1:32:36] call of arms i'm calling you into action
[1:32:38] to fight to keep this message pure
[1:32:42] keep it the way the prophet of god
[1:32:44] established it and ordained it not
[1:32:46] hybridized with man's ideas
[1:32:49] so it's we're called to arms we're
[1:32:52] summoned to take up the cause to rightly
[1:32:54] divide the word of god
[1:32:57] to discern the spirit that's working
[1:32:59] within the church
[1:33:00] see how long was this to last till we
[1:33:03] all come into the unity of the faith
[1:33:07] not until your favorite preacher came by
[1:33:09] no until he all comes into the unity of
[1:33:12] the faith to the knowledge of the son of
[1:33:13] god unto the perfect man until we come
[1:33:16] into the stature of the fullness of
[1:33:17] christ otherwise until we receive our
[1:33:21] body change
[1:33:23] god establish a five-fold ministry
[1:33:27] for your perfection
[1:33:29] for your perfection
[1:33:30] for your perfection for our unity
[1:33:35] because we're all going to be one it's a
[1:33:37] body
[1:33:40] notice
[1:33:41] but man today claims he's got a better
[1:33:42] way he's got a better program
[1:33:45] and that is to be like
[1:33:47] our sister churches or denominational
[1:33:49] harvest that we came out of now we want
[1:33:51] to headquarters and we want to just do
[1:33:53] this and do this and i'm not pointing
[1:33:55] back all the voice of god in that aspect
[1:33:57] not at all but we have within the ranks
[1:33:59] of the message there's paparusia
[1:34:01] movement there's a two-soul movement
[1:34:03] there's a deity movement there's a a
[1:34:05] thunder movement there's all these
[1:34:07] movements and they all have a
[1:34:08] headquarters
[1:34:10] but god never intended if the prophet of
[1:34:12] god ever intended to set up those type
[1:34:14] of headquarters he would have done it
[1:34:16] when he was here
[1:34:18] he would have ordained a joe coleman to
[1:34:21] set up the headquarters of thunders
[1:34:24] he wouldn't ordain a level to
[1:34:26] headquarter the parisian movement he
[1:34:28] would have done that himself
[1:34:30] but we find after him going off the
[1:34:32] scene the holy spirit was still on the
[1:34:35] scene
[1:34:36] but man began to choose
[1:34:39] man leadership and not the holy spirit
[1:34:41] leadership and now you find you got
[1:34:43] these different fractions and factions
[1:34:46] in the message and they have their own
[1:34:48] little camps and we got all these camps
[1:34:51] and there's so many camps and if you go
[1:34:52] to africa there's even more camps in
[1:34:54] africa
[1:34:55] there's the elohim movement some that
[1:34:57] claim they're elohim himself
[1:34:59] they got some that can speak you in and
[1:35:01] speak you out some that have all this
[1:35:03] power and all this authority
[1:35:05] but where did god ever put that in a man
[1:35:09] he never placed it in his prophet
[1:35:13] and if he never place it in his prophet
[1:35:15] who are we to take that burden upon our
[1:35:18] shoulders and say you can have it and
[1:35:20] you can't
[1:35:22] i'm so glad that man is not in control
[1:35:24] of my life
[1:35:26] is this okay this morning
[1:35:29] see what are they trying to do they're
[1:35:30] trying it's the spirit of nicolaitanism
[1:35:32] is trying to denominate the bride but
[1:35:34] notice
[1:35:36] though they would never fill out the
[1:35:38] paperwork or charter
[1:35:40] for a new denomination they do it in
[1:35:42] their spirit
[1:35:44] they do it with their doctrines they do
[1:35:47] it in their preaching
[1:35:50] they do it with their ideas
[1:35:53] but this bride
[1:35:54] how many of your bride this morning
[1:35:57] i'm going to say it like the prophet of
[1:35:58] god said this bride will not be
[1:36:00] denominated
[1:36:02] otherwise she's not going to be
[1:36:05] manhandled
[1:36:08] she's not going to be manhandled so when
[1:36:10] you find a man trying to handle you his
[1:36:12] own way telling you what you can and
[1:36:13] what you can't do you just go ahead and
[1:36:15] get away from the man
[1:36:17] well you say well brother joe brother
[1:36:19] brown said if the man gets off the word
[1:36:21] then you leave the man well man is off
[1:36:22] the word when he begins to try to handle
[1:36:24] you with his own mind in his own ways in
[1:36:27] his own ideas if he's not following the
[1:36:29] leadership of the holy ghost you have
[1:36:31] permission by the authority of the word
[1:36:33] of god to leave that man at that point
[1:36:35] in time
[1:36:38] brother says in christ is the mystery of
[1:36:40] god revealed paragraph 4 4 12. now no
[1:36:43] denomination but the revelation of his
[1:36:45] mystery see no denomination the
[1:36:47] revelation god is not known by the
[1:36:49] nomination he is known by revelation now
[1:36:52] can the church say revelation
[1:36:54] man y'all are weak this morning come on
[1:36:56] revelation
[1:36:58] we're gonna do it one more time because
[1:36:59] three i heard that three is is
[1:37:00] perfection
[1:37:02] revelation
[1:37:04] oh man there is life in the tucson
[1:37:06] tabernacle
[1:37:08] notice he says now god is not known by
[1:37:10] denomination but by revelation
[1:37:14] he says god in his body christ and
[1:37:17] christ in his body the bride god made
[1:37:20] manifest in christ and christ made
[1:37:22] manifest in the bride and as god took
[1:37:25] from the body of adam the woman and she
[1:37:27] fell then god took from the body of
[1:37:29] christ his flesh his body which is the
[1:37:32] word and is bringing a bride out that
[1:37:35] won't fall by the nomination or creed no
[1:37:38] sir but she is coming back with their
[1:37:41] pure
[1:37:42] unadulterated word of god being
[1:37:44] manifested i'm here to tell you let it
[1:37:47] ring out again this bride will not be
[1:37:50] denominated she is coming out because
[1:37:52] all that god was he poured it into
[1:37:55] christ and all that christ was he pours
[1:37:58] it into his body and that body can't be
[1:38:00] manhandled that body can't receive a
[1:38:02] spirit of air that body has thus saith
[1:38:05] the lord and she's moving in the power
[1:38:07] of the word of god
[1:38:10] so how about god brother man says how
[1:38:12] about god joining himself this is
[1:38:14] intuition of a bride
[1:38:15] joining himself to something like that a
[1:38:17] regular denominational prostitute you
[1:38:19] think he would do it
[1:38:23] you think he would join himself to a
[1:38:25] regular denominational prostitute
[1:38:28] he says having a form of godliness but
[1:38:30] denying the power of he will never do it
[1:38:33] she must have his character in her
[1:38:38] how do you get that character in you by
[1:38:40] being born again of the spirit of god
[1:38:43] notice the real true born again church
[1:38:46] must have the character that was in
[1:38:48] christ because the husband and the wife
[1:38:50] are one and if jesus did not did only
[1:38:53] that which pleased god kept his word and
[1:38:56] manifested his word his bride will have
[1:38:58] to be the same kind of character
[1:39:02] she could not by no means be a
[1:39:05] denomination
[1:39:07] let me just say that one more time she
[1:39:09] could not by no means being a nomination
[1:39:13] because then no matter how much they
[1:39:15] want to say no he says she's controlled
[1:39:17] by a board somewhere that tells her what
[1:39:20] to do and what she can do and many times
[1:39:22] a million miles off the true word of god
[1:39:29] tell you what to do and what you can't
[1:39:31] do
[1:39:33] oh he said it seemed to suit the people
[1:39:35] though
[1:39:36] that his robe upon him would look great
[1:39:39] talking about the son of kish saul
[1:39:42] upon his head way above all the other
[1:39:44] people as he walked and real asset to
[1:39:46] the kingdom of israel for the other
[1:39:48] kings other nations would think look
[1:39:50] what a man
[1:39:51] man look at the leadership of that look
[1:39:54] at the money they're bringing into that
[1:39:56] church
[1:39:59] look at look at that building my mama
[1:40:03] look at it a monstrosity
[1:40:08] see we look at the outside things and
[1:40:09] think that's god's blessing
[1:40:13] i see god blessing right here
[1:40:17] god blessing right here in the
[1:40:18] tabernacle we've seen god move in this
[1:40:21] church
[1:40:22] right here time and time and time again
[1:40:26] how many of you've been healed in this
[1:40:27] church
[1:40:28] the spirit of god came by your way and
[1:40:30] healed you and delivered you in this
[1:40:32] church that's the movement that didn't
[1:40:34] have anything to do with a man no but it
[1:40:36] was a son of man sons of god who are led
[1:40:39] by the spirit of what to preach how to
[1:40:41] speak how to preach and to invite the
[1:40:43] presence of god down so that that god
[1:40:45] can minister to your needs
[1:40:50] notice he said
[1:40:52] and sad to say but how true it is today
[1:40:54] with the church that they love to say
[1:40:55] our pastor is not narrow-minded he's not
[1:40:57] a narrow-minded man he's a great man
[1:40:59] he's a graduate from hartford or some
[1:41:01] great school of theology he has four
[1:41:02] degrees out of sowing such a place and a
[1:41:04] very good mixture amongst the people all
[1:41:06] that may all he said all that may be all
[1:41:08] right it has his place but god's way is
[1:41:11] for the church to be led by the holy
[1:41:12] ghost and by the spirit so i just want
[1:41:15] to be clear this morning i'm not here
[1:41:17] and i'm not bashing individuals i'm not
[1:41:20] here and i'm not preaching against
[1:41:22] individuals but what i am doing is i'm
[1:41:24] calling you to arms to discern the
[1:41:26] spirit that anoints the individual that
[1:41:29] tries to come and cause division among
[1:41:31] the body
[1:41:33] see brother branham never hit against a
[1:41:35] man he never hit against the women of
[1:41:37] the denominations he hid against the
[1:41:39] spirit of denominations he was able to
[1:41:42] discern the spirit when it would try to
[1:41:43] come in and he would lash out against
[1:41:46] the spirit and sometimes the people took
[1:41:48] it the wrong way
[1:41:50] and they thought he was against them see
[1:41:52] but it's not he's against the spirit of
[1:41:54] the nomination the spirit of nicoletism
[1:41:58] and that's what we're fighting against
[1:41:59] this morning that's what i'm calling you
[1:42:01] to arms against this morning we're on
[1:42:03] the eve of d-day
[1:42:06] i'm calling you to fight for the truth
[1:42:08] of this message
[1:42:09] fight for the reality because it
[1:42:11] produces exactly what the prophet of god
[1:42:14] said it would produce
[1:42:17] see we're not fighting against men and
[1:42:18] women we're those are our brothers
[1:42:19] they're our sisters but we've been
[1:42:21] called to fight for the truth fight to
[1:42:23] allow god to rule the church and to lead
[1:42:25] the church and not have a headquarters
[1:42:27] telling us when and what to do we're
[1:42:29] fighting for the supernatural so that
[1:42:31] the signs will follow those that believe
[1:42:33] we're fighting to keep prayer lines in
[1:42:35] the church so that you can have your
[1:42:37] needs met and when you walk into a
[1:42:39] prayer line you'll meet god in the
[1:42:41] prayer line you're not meeting a man and
[1:42:43] that god will come by and bring an
[1:42:45] instantaneous healing to you just like
[1:42:47] he did brother ed back there who had a
[1:42:50] situation in his body and dealt with it
[1:42:52] for 40 years but he met god in a prayer
[1:42:54] line or let me say it like this god met
[1:42:56] him in a prayer line and he's not had
[1:42:58] any trouble since that's the god that we
[1:43:01] serve church i'm preaching to you about
[1:43:03] a living god who wants to live through
[1:43:06] his people
[1:43:08] he wants to be free to move through his
[1:43:10] people he wants to be free to manifest
[1:43:13] himself through his people but the
[1:43:15] people begin to limit god
[1:43:18] see we're fighting to keep the message
[1:43:20] pure keep man's ideas out of it
[1:43:23] keep their thoughts out of it keep their
[1:43:25] special doctrines out of it
[1:43:27] i don't want your special doctrine i'm
[1:43:30] sticking with a prophet
[1:43:31] i got 1200 sermons and if i don't find
[1:43:34] your special doctrine in that 1200 then
[1:43:36] forget it i don't have nothing for it
[1:43:40] i'm not going to gum it down and eat it
[1:43:43] now i got a weak stomach
[1:43:46] you get a fly in the soup i'm not eating
[1:43:48] the soup
[1:43:50] my wife will tell you there's been more
[1:43:51] than one time they talking about
[1:43:53] something at the house i run out the
[1:43:54] front door
[1:43:56] heaving and huffing
[1:43:57] glass out and up chucking
[1:44:02] and i say that to say we
[1:44:04] some of us would just pick the fly out
[1:44:07] i'm coming down some of you will not
[1:44:09] even you bring me a noob matter of fact
[1:44:11] we're not even going to eat at this
[1:44:12] restaurant
[1:44:13] you can take that kind of attitude about
[1:44:15] something in your soup but what about
[1:44:17] what's going into your soul
[1:44:21] don't take this the wrong way i'm just
[1:44:22] trying to protect your church
[1:44:26] see we're fighting
[1:44:28] for the holy spirit
[1:44:29] to lead men and women
[1:44:33] holy spirit leadership
[1:44:35] we're fighting so that the bride can
[1:44:37] have her own revival
[1:44:39] i don't need a man's revival i need my
[1:44:41] own revival
[1:44:43] and that revival comes by receiving the
[1:44:46] vindicated word of the hour
[1:44:48] not some special idea
[1:44:50] not some special doctrine we're not
[1:44:52] fighting to build our own kingdom
[1:44:55] or to help a man build his kingdom but
[1:44:57] we're fighting so that god can restore
[1:45:00] his kingdom the prophet of god said he
[1:45:02] had a threefold purpose of his coming
[1:45:06] to have preeminence in a body
[1:45:10] so he came in the form of christ so that
[1:45:12] he could redeem fallen man then he
[1:45:14] wanted to have preeminence in that
[1:45:15] falling creation and not only that then
[1:45:17] he wanted to restore
[1:45:19] that creation back to the kingdom back
[1:45:22] to its rightful position
[1:45:25] see we're fighting for the rapture of
[1:45:27] the church
[1:45:28] and that would only take place
[1:45:31] when you know who you are
[1:45:33] you need a quote for that don't you
[1:45:36] no well i'm gonna give you one anyway
[1:45:39] he says in christ's mystery if the
[1:45:41] church only knew its position it will
[1:45:44] one day
[1:45:46] oh i said it will one day
[1:45:48] he says then the rapture will go when it
[1:45:51] knows what it is
[1:45:54] oh church that's what we're fighting for
[1:45:57] so you can know your position
[1:46:01] you can know that you're called by god
[1:46:03] not by man
[1:46:05] see god sent on the day of pentecost the
[1:46:07] holy spirit to rule the church to rule a
[1:46:10] man's heart and to rule in their lives
[1:46:12] and he says and it was not meant for one
[1:46:15] man to rule over another man
[1:46:17] but we love to say that we love to say
[1:46:21] that because man like saul exalts
[1:46:24] himself
[1:46:25] in a position because he prophesied
[1:46:28] i must be something
[1:46:30] i'm among the prophets and he used that
[1:46:33] clout he used
[1:46:36] that influence to sway the people so
[1:46:40] they did exactly what saul wanted them
[1:46:42] to do
[1:46:44] but saul was not the right pick god
[1:46:46] already had his pick the people chose
[1:46:49] saul
[1:46:51] see god already had david in the wings
[1:46:53] he knew samuel was going to go by the
[1:46:55] way of the grave he knew maybe that
[1:46:57] there was going to be a dispensational
[1:46:59] change
[1:47:00] and he was waiting because daniel or
[1:47:03] david was only a child
[1:47:06] and so the people because they just
[1:47:08] couldn't wait they couldn't wait
[1:47:10] couldn't wait couldn't wait hope that
[1:47:12] sounds familiar couldn't wait
[1:47:14] couldn't wait well brother joe come on
[1:47:15] it's been seven years can't wait can't
[1:47:17] wait can't wait don't you grasp the
[1:47:19] first thing that comes
[1:47:22] make sure it's godly leadership
[1:47:25] god inspired preaching god inspired
[1:47:29] decisions god inspired anointing god
[1:47:33] inspired leadership servitude
[1:47:36] god inspired
[1:47:38] not an overlord not a dictator someone
[1:47:40] tell you a pastor is one thing
[1:47:43] that you don't have right now right it's
[1:47:45] obvious
[1:47:46] but it's one of the hardest things to
[1:47:47] get rid of
[1:47:49] you say well we can just vote him in and
[1:47:51] vote him out not that simple
[1:47:54] some people may like that
[1:47:56] and that one vote
[1:47:57] sways the entire group
[1:47:59] because it's got to be unanimous
[1:48:02] so you get 49 4 51 or 51 449 against
[1:48:07] he's there
[1:48:09] then he's got the sway of the people
[1:48:11] then you see kingdoms starting to build
[1:48:12] up
[1:48:14] kingdoms then they says well you know
[1:48:15] what y'all can't go over to north side
[1:48:18] and you can't go here and you can't go
[1:48:20] there and you can't go to these meetings
[1:48:21] and heaven forbid you ever go to
[1:48:22] louisiana youth camp
[1:48:24] you can't go there either because we
[1:48:25] don't believe in that we don't believe
[1:48:26] in all that emotion
[1:48:29] you laugh but that's what happens that's
[1:48:32] exactly what's being proclaimed i heard
[1:48:35] a pastor
[1:48:37] just say just the other day he goes um
[1:48:39] brother bran was paralyzed i want you to
[1:48:40] see how
[1:48:42] carnal we get
[1:48:44] not we we're led by the spirit of god
[1:48:46] right
[1:48:47] just what this man said and it just it
[1:48:50] resonated in me and it did everything i
[1:48:52] could not pick up a phone and say look
[1:48:53] what in the world are you talking about
[1:48:55] but he had the audacity
[1:48:58] to say did you ever see anybody fall out
[1:49:02] in one of brother branham's prayer lines
[1:49:06] there's only one or two sermons that's
[1:49:08] been on video anyway
[1:49:10] everything is in audio format
[1:49:13] how do we know what took place
[1:49:16] all i can say is i've seen the same holy
[1:49:19] spirit move in our prayer lines i've
[1:49:21] seen them shout
[1:49:24] the last time i was here
[1:49:27] i've seen them shout
[1:49:28] i've seen them healed i've seen them
[1:49:30] delivered i've seen them fall out
[1:49:34] you telling me that ain't the holy ghost
[1:49:36] you telling me that ain't of god
[1:49:38] and you want to say
[1:49:40] how many have ever seen it happen in
[1:49:41] brother branham's ministry
[1:49:43] well we don't know people
[1:49:46] but i promise you if we could have
[1:49:48] followed it you'd have sent us you would
[1:49:49] have seen the same holy ghost because
[1:49:51] you've seen the healings
[1:49:53] you heard the response you heard the
[1:49:55] shouts you heard the screams you heard
[1:49:57] the emotion you heard all of it so if
[1:49:59] all that was there then you'd have to
[1:50:01] expect there would be those that came
[1:50:03] under the anointing and was slain in the
[1:50:05] spirit as well
[1:50:07] you had tongues
[1:50:09] you had the interpretation of tongues
[1:50:11] so now we have gotten 60 years removed
[1:50:13] from the prophet's ministry from the
[1:50:15] prophet's life
[1:50:17] and now we want to start questioning
[1:50:18] that because maybe you're not geared to
[1:50:20] emotion
[1:50:22] and that's perfectly fine
[1:50:24] we're not asking you to all be clones
[1:50:27] of this one or that one
[1:50:30] but don't stop and hinder the movement
[1:50:32] of the spirit because it doesn't come
[1:50:34] the way you perceive or what in it you
[1:50:36] know because maybe you like the teaching
[1:50:38] gift
[1:50:40] some of you may like the evangelistic
[1:50:42] flair with all the wow wow wow
[1:50:45] like some kung fu master up there just
[1:50:47] with a little time
[1:50:49] you know we're all different you're
[1:50:52] different i'm different we're different
[1:50:54] but we make up a body
[1:50:57] and for man to make those kind of those
[1:51:00] kind of proclamations from behind the
[1:51:02] pulpit what he just done is swayed 300
[1:51:04] people
[1:51:06] that everything that happens at
[1:51:07] louisiana camp is wrong it's an heir
[1:51:09] it's not of the holy spirit
[1:51:12] and the problem of god said there's more
[1:51:13] than one way to kill a man
[1:51:15] you don't have to stick a knife in his
[1:51:16] back you kill his influence
[1:51:18] so what about those young people that
[1:51:20] attend that church now when they come to
[1:51:22] a louisiana camp
[1:51:24] will they receive or will they think
[1:51:27] that's just hogwash
[1:51:28] that's just emotion that's just man
[1:51:31] be careful
[1:51:33] be careful how you handle the holy
[1:51:34] spirit be careful brother batman said be
[1:51:36] careful blasphemy is the only
[1:51:38] unpardonable sin
[1:51:40] and that's to make fun of the holy
[1:51:42] spirit
[1:51:44] because i promise you i've seen god move
[1:51:47] brother ron spencer and i stood right in
[1:51:49] front of each other in our prayer line
[1:51:51] of our at our last camp
[1:51:53] and he looked at me and he said brother
[1:51:54] joe he said the angel lord is right here
[1:51:58] and when he came down bam bam bam they
[1:52:01] went out and they hauled them off and
[1:52:03] then the holy spirit lifted and you see
[1:52:05] some just kind of come through
[1:52:06] he'd come back down bam bam bam
[1:52:10] and lift back up because you could tell
[1:52:12] the holy spirit knew who to deal with
[1:52:14] there were some that were coming with
[1:52:15] sincerity and when he when they come
[1:52:17] with sincerity holy spirit dropped down
[1:52:19] and they just fell out bam bam bam and
[1:52:22] then those that were just coming through
[1:52:23] to come through the spirit lifted up and
[1:52:25] they just walked right on through
[1:52:27] but i can tell you it was the holy ghost
[1:52:29] every time it was the holy ghost
[1:52:33] but you got to be careful that's why i'm
[1:52:35] preaching this this morning is we're
[1:52:36] called to arms to protect
[1:52:40] this right here
[1:52:42] this right here has to be protected at
[1:52:44] all times
[1:52:46] this pulpit is sacred
[1:52:48] and the words that come from behind this
[1:52:49] pulpit must be anointed and it must be
[1:52:52] god inspired
[1:52:53] it can't be some man's idea just to try
[1:52:56] to grab hold of a congregation it has to
[1:52:58] be god god god god
[1:53:02] and be careful
[1:53:04] i will say it to pastors to preachers be
[1:53:06] careful
[1:53:08] not to interject your own ideas
[1:53:11] brother says but man wants to rule and
[1:53:13] rule over man and man wants man to rule
[1:53:16] over him
[1:53:17] let me see my goodness i got
[1:53:20] y'all i can't even get done today
[1:53:23] i'm having too much fun preaching this
[1:53:24] this morning
[1:53:26] can i go a little bit further this
[1:53:27] morning
[1:53:29] nobody's going to get up and walk out on
[1:53:30] me i know the lunch is right down the
[1:53:32] road there there's mexican there's all
[1:53:33] kinds of stuff we'll eat later
[1:53:36] he said but man wants to rule and rule
[1:53:38] over man and man wants man to rule over
[1:53:42] him
[1:53:44] see he doesn't want to have
[1:53:46] god to rule
[1:53:48] so this son of kish saul by name
[1:53:50] was just an answer to what they had
[1:53:52] wanted a great stately man oh he could
[1:53:55] just lead them to their battles and so
[1:53:57] forth but still it wasn't god's way of
[1:53:59] doing things god wanted his faithful old
[1:54:02] prophet to direct them and speak his
[1:54:05] words to them
[1:54:06] see god never ordained fallen man to
[1:54:10] lead fallen man
[1:54:12] he never ordained for man to tell you
[1:54:15] when how where what and all that
[1:54:18] where you can go on vacation
[1:54:21] what car you can buy and by the way i'm
[1:54:24] going to drive at tesla before i leave
[1:54:25] this weekend
[1:54:27] you wasn't here last time so i got you
[1:54:29] this morning
[1:54:31] yeah
[1:54:32] i'm putting that out that's man's idea i
[1:54:34] get it
[1:54:36] y'all can scratch that that was not
[1:54:37] anointed
[1:54:39] all right tell you what boy or girl you
[1:54:41] can marry see
[1:54:42] god never ordained man to fight man's
[1:54:44] battles
[1:54:45] he tells us over and over and over and
[1:54:48] over and over and over and over in the
[1:54:50] old testament
[1:54:51] i the lord will fight your battles
[1:54:54] why did he
[1:54:56] send us malachi 4 why did he send us
[1:54:58] luke 17 30 why did he send us
[1:55:00] revelations 10 7 was to turn our hearts
[1:55:03] away from man leadership
[1:55:05] back to holy ghost leadership
[1:55:08] because the leadership of man had its
[1:55:09] place
[1:55:10] there was a time that god used that
[1:55:12] leadership
[1:55:13] but we're not in the dispensation of man
[1:55:15] any longer we're in the ego anointing
[1:55:18] holy spirit anointing holy spirit
[1:55:20] direction
[1:55:22] so
[1:55:22] god wants to lead his church in
[1:55:26] out or in through and out of laodicea
[1:55:30] he wants to heal your diseases
[1:55:34] he wants to deliver you of your torment
[1:55:36] and spirits in your troubles god wants
[1:55:38] to do that he wants to fight your
[1:55:40] battles he tells us in exodus 14 14 the
[1:55:43] lord shall fight for you and you shall
[1:55:45] hold your peace deuteronomy 1 and verse
[1:55:48] 30 the lord your god which goeth before
[1:55:50] you he shall fight for you deuteronomy 3
[1:55:52] and verse 22 you shall not fear them for
[1:55:55] the lord your god shall fight for you
[1:55:58] deuteronomy 20 and verse 4 for the lord
[1:56:00] your god it is he that goeth with you to
[1:56:03] fight for you against your enemies to
[1:56:05] save you second chronicles 13 and verse
[1:56:07] 12. and behold god himself is with us
[1:56:10] for our captain and his priest with the
[1:56:12] sounding trumpets to crowd the alarm
[1:56:14] against you oh children of israel fight
[1:56:17] ye not against the lord god of your
[1:56:18] fathers for you shall not prosper
[1:56:22] and in second chronicles 20 and verse 7
[1:56:24] you shall not need to fight in this
[1:56:26] battle but set yourself stand ye still
[1:56:29] and see the salvation
[1:56:31] of the lord
[1:56:32] so god was telling them then
[1:56:35] you don't need to choose a man
[1:56:37] i got it
[1:56:38] i'll fight for you i'll lead you i'll
[1:56:41] take you through i'll bring you into
[1:56:43] that promised land not only will i bring
[1:56:45] you into it i'll prosper you while
[1:56:47] you're there
[1:56:48] i'll take care of your jericho's i'll
[1:56:50] take care of your ais i'll take care of
[1:56:53] the ammolites or the amalekites i'll
[1:56:55] take care of the jebusites i'll take
[1:56:57] care of all these things just follow my
[1:57:00] leadership
[1:57:02] but we want a king kind of like that
[1:57:04] little boy when it was storming that
[1:57:05] night but mama i want a guy with skin on
[1:57:07] it
[1:57:09] and sometimes that's how we are
[1:57:11] let's just be honest
[1:57:13] sometimes look brother joe we've been
[1:57:15] without a pastor we just need somebody
[1:57:19] and a lot of you probably said that in
[1:57:21] your mind
[1:57:22] we just need somebody to assume the
[1:57:24] responsibilities of the tabernacle and
[1:57:27] you're right but you need the right
[1:57:29] somebody
[1:57:30] not the wrong somebody
[1:57:34] see god never intended no ordained man
[1:57:37] to fight your battle
[1:57:39] he was going to do it
[1:57:40] no matter what that battle may be
[1:57:42] god was willing to take up arms for you
[1:57:46] now i'm summoning you to take up arms
[1:57:47] from him
[1:57:49] do what he's called you to do
[1:57:51] to serve him
[1:57:52] and we would find as i go let me just
[1:57:54] kind of go a little further and see if i
[1:57:55] can find me a stopping place here this
[1:57:57] morning
[1:57:59] barbara talks about
[1:58:02] mark 16 and we know mark 16 very
[1:58:04] familiar but i'm just going to read it
[1:58:06] because we need to see mark mark 16
[1:58:10] alive amongst the body of christ and it
[1:58:12] says mark 16 verse 15 and he said unto
[1:58:14] them go ye into all the world and preach
[1:58:16] the gospel to every creature and he that
[1:58:18] is baptized
[1:58:20] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[1:58:22] shall be damned and these signs shall
[1:58:24] follow them that believe so there's
[1:58:26] signs to follow the believer
[1:58:28] how many are believers
[1:58:31] all right good
[1:58:32] these signs will follow them that
[1:58:33] believe in my name they should cast out
[1:58:35] devils that's gonna probably scare a
[1:58:37] whole bunch of you right there right
[1:58:39] oh my
[1:58:40] brother joe devil fighting
[1:58:44] you shall cast out devils
[1:58:46] he says and they shall speak with new
[1:58:48] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:58:51] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:58:53] not hurt them and they shall lay hands
[1:58:55] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:58:58] and brother branham will tell us he said
[1:59:00] today in the great church age that we
[1:59:02] live in i think and i believe this with
[1:59:04] all my heart that we have exactly gone
[1:59:06] vice versa from what god ordained us to
[1:59:08] do and he references mark 16.
[1:59:12] he references mark 16. he's saying god's
[1:59:15] telling us that these signs will follow
[1:59:17] the believers but we've done vice versa
[1:59:20] now i'm not inviting you to bring a
[1:59:22] bunch of snakes into the church this
[1:59:23] morning
[1:59:25] i'm not testing your faith nor mine
[1:59:27] but i know that god said these signs
[1:59:29] will follow them that believe
[1:59:31] and you that been healed you can testify
[1:59:34] that they did follow
[1:59:36] you that were delivered or tormented
[1:59:38] spirits you can testify that they did
[1:59:40] follow but a lot of times we want to
[1:59:42] focus on the last part of this they
[1:59:44] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:59:45] shall recover but there's signs
[1:59:47] following there's ministries there's
[1:59:48] casting out of spirits when we were at
[1:59:50] our louisiana camp and i'll just give
[1:59:52] you one reference on a sunday morning i
[1:59:54] was up dealing with a young lady my wife
[1:59:57] and sister lydia and i were dealing with
[1:59:59] a young lady on saturday night who came
[2:00:01] in the prayer line
[2:00:03] who was anointed with a
[2:00:05] an evil spirit and she fell over and
[2:00:08] began to convult and shake and writhe
[2:00:10] and and slither and we pulled her to the
[2:00:12] back so that we can work with her to get
[2:00:14] her off the platform so it doesn't cause
[2:00:16] a scene and we work with her we work
[2:00:18] with her for over an hour
[2:00:21] 45 minutes just to get her to calm down
[2:00:25] because she at one point even began to
[2:00:27] foam out of the mouth like a dog
[2:00:30] evil spirits are real
[2:00:32] but i want you to know god's word is
[2:00:35] greater
[2:00:36] so we work with her and work with her
[2:00:37] and work with her sometimes we think
[2:00:39] well we just lay hands on them and cast
[2:00:40] that devil off and then our mac leaves
[2:00:42] no it doesn't happen that way because
[2:00:43] that evil spirit is holding on because
[2:00:45] it knows it has to go
[2:00:47] all right because we have a word of god
[2:00:49] that says you should cast out devils and
[2:00:51] once it's exposed and that person
[2:00:53] repents of the things that they've done
[2:00:55] then that spirit can no more lie no more
[2:00:57] stay there but it's fighting and holding
[2:00:59] on and we begin to deal with her and a
[2:01:01] spirit would leave but yet there was
[2:01:03] other spirits there and brother ron said
[2:01:05] she was she was dealt with uh how did he
[2:01:08] say i think she was molested as a young
[2:01:10] child
[2:01:11] and he said make sure you go get two
[2:01:13] strong sisters to go back there with
[2:01:14] them to deal with because that thing
[2:01:16] will not allow a man to work with it
[2:01:18] and so they went and got my wife and
[2:01:19] they went guys sister lydia which is
[2:01:21] brother aaron oglesby's wife and they my
[2:01:23] wife can testify it took everything
[2:01:25] within our human ability to keep her
[2:01:27] hands down and keep her feet down
[2:01:28] because she was just moving just erratic
[2:01:31] i mean uns ungodly strength supernatural
[2:01:34] strength and this is a young 15 year old
[2:01:36] girl
[2:01:38] and we worked with him we worked with
[2:01:40] her and we worked with her for an hour
[2:01:41] and all of us were physically getting
[2:01:43] exhausted
[2:01:44] and then finally brother matt mcgary he
[2:01:47] came back to the back and this young
[2:01:49] lady happens to go to their church and i
[2:01:51] said matt i
[2:01:52] i can't go no further i'm gonna put you
[2:01:54] here and i put sister jessica here
[2:01:56] sister lydia here and i put brother matt
[2:01:58] right here and i just was right here to
[2:02:00] the side and we finally got her to come
[2:02:03] and she could be able to tell what's
[2:02:04] going on and brother matt began to work
[2:02:06] with her and begin to get her to a place
[2:02:08] where she could repent of some of the
[2:02:09] things that she did and then we come to
[2:02:12] fight and when she once she repented of
[2:02:14] those things her body just went limp
[2:02:17] because the spirit no longer had hole it
[2:02:19] left
[2:02:20] because it had to leave
[2:02:22] right
[2:02:23] because it can't stay
[2:02:25] because it was exposed and she repented
[2:02:28] of it you know it's no different than
[2:02:29] that maniac in oregon when they when
[2:02:31] brother branham said you challenge the
[2:02:33] spirit of the lord today and the spirit
[2:02:35] of the lord is here to accept that
[2:02:36] challenge when he went to swing adam
[2:02:39] he said
[2:02:40] in the name of the lord and the man spun
[2:02:43] around and fell across his feet and the
[2:02:44] two policeman says is he delivered he
[2:02:46] said no he's not delivered is he healed
[2:02:48] no he's not healed
[2:02:51] he's not free because he worships that
[2:02:53] thing because he thinks he's right
[2:02:57] see he never if he would have ever
[2:02:59] repented of the way he was thinking he
[2:03:01] would have been delivered and set free
[2:03:04] and so when this young girl finally got
[2:03:05] to that point about an hour and a half
[2:03:07] into it she finally got to a point of
[2:03:09] repentance that spirit broke off over
[2:03:11] she was free
[2:03:13] and she went back that following week
[2:03:14] and gave testimony at their church of
[2:03:16] what happened to her as a four-year-old
[2:03:18] little girl somebody touched her
[2:03:20] somebody molested her
[2:03:22] and that spirit grabbed onto her and
[2:03:23] made it think that it was her and so she
[2:03:25] invited other things
[2:03:27] and other things
[2:03:29] but see the spirit of god's never wrong
[2:03:32] now you may say that's out of line you
[2:03:34] may say that's not church order
[2:03:36] but you won't ask her to tell her that's
[2:03:38] not order when she got delivered
[2:03:42] so sunday morning
[2:03:44] it's sunrise service and i'm gonna close
[2:03:46] here in just a minute i'll leave with
[2:03:47] with this last thought here
[2:03:50] sunday morning there was another young
[2:03:51] girl happens to be this young girl's
[2:03:53] friend and she was hyperventilating come
[2:03:55] out anxiety and all this fear just over
[2:03:57] and over
[2:03:58] and it was about 6 30 in the morning it
[2:04:00] was early service and i'm half asleep
[2:04:01] because i was up to one o'clock dealing
[2:04:03] with this other case and had to get up
[2:04:05] and come over
[2:04:06] and so i got my coffee in my hand and
[2:04:08] you know sometimes you just gotta drink
[2:04:09] coffee first
[2:04:11] i mean you just gotta wake up you gotta
[2:04:13] know what you're doing right
[2:04:15] and i know this is colonel but they said
[2:04:17] bro joe she needs you to pray for her i
[2:04:18] said well she been she can wait i'm
[2:04:20] gonna finish my coffee
[2:04:21] and so because i didn't know was i'm
[2:04:23] gonna be in something like i was in last
[2:04:24] night
[2:04:25] so i went over there after i finished my
[2:04:27] coffee and began to talk to her and
[2:04:28] there was another sister there an older
[2:04:30] sister from brother donny reagan's
[2:04:31] church was there and she began to tell
[2:04:32] me well she's got anxiety and some fear
[2:04:34] and i began to talk to her she says yeah
[2:04:36] she goes i just saw all that happen last
[2:04:38] night and you know i just i'm afraid
[2:04:40] it's all going to come back on me and
[2:04:41] it's going to be on me and i don't want
[2:04:43] that and she was just real nervous just
[2:04:44] a real wreck and i began to just talk to
[2:04:47] her and kind of console her a little bit
[2:04:48] and i said we're just going to pray
[2:04:49] we're just going to we're just going to
[2:04:50] rebuke this spirit of fear and you know
[2:04:52] fear has torment but fear can't save
[2:04:54] because perfect love is here and perfect
[2:04:55] love casts out all fear when i went to
[2:04:57] put my hands on her and pray that spirit
[2:04:59] spoke out i don't like you
[2:05:03] i
[2:05:04] don't like you
[2:05:06] i said well good i don't like you either
[2:05:09] now i didn't just jump out and and flip
[2:05:11] out i knew who i was i know my calling
[2:05:15] and i've i've dealt with these things
[2:05:17] time and time again and that spirit said
[2:05:20] i'm not gonna let her go
[2:05:22] that's the kind of voice i'm not gonna
[2:05:24] let her go you can't have her i said i
[2:05:26] don't want her but you can't have her
[2:05:27] either
[2:05:29] and i told her to shut its mouth and i
[2:05:31] commanded it to leave and just boom it
[2:05:33] left
[2:05:34] just like that
[2:05:35] see one refused to leave because there
[2:05:37] was there was some repenting that had to
[2:05:39] be done this one didn't have anything to
[2:05:41] repent of it just got there and it was
[2:05:42] anxiety and fear and when it left but it
[2:05:45] tried to boast and put a scare in by
[2:05:46] speaking you can't have her
[2:05:49] i don't like you
[2:05:51] let me tell you what that lifted my
[2:05:52] faith realized that thing looked at me
[2:05:54] and said i don't like you i'm like well
[2:05:55] praise god
[2:05:57] that real i mean i feel great
[2:06:01] so i'll tell you these things because
[2:06:02] these things are real
[2:06:04] and the prophet of god said these gifts
[2:06:07] should be in operation in the church
[2:06:10] they should be in operation in the and
[2:06:12] that's what we're fighting for
[2:06:14] is to allow the spirit of god to operate
[2:06:19] in the local body
[2:06:21] he said well brother joe we don't have a
[2:06:22] pastor
[2:06:23] that doesn't matter you're still a local
[2:06:25] body
[2:06:26] allow the gifts of god to operate in the
[2:06:30] local assembly allow anointing of the
[2:06:33] holy spirit to come in the assembly
[2:06:35] allow speaking in tongues
[2:06:38] don't forbid it
[2:06:39] don't forbid interpretations don't
[2:06:42] forbid to move another spirit don't
[2:06:44] forbid emotion
[2:06:46] i'm not telling tell you y'all need to
[2:06:47] be a bunch of popcorns and just popping
[2:06:49] up all over the place but there's there
[2:06:50] is order with it
[2:06:53] but we get stimulated by revelation
[2:06:57] and when revelation comes it excites
[2:06:59] something within you that you can't
[2:07:01] control
[2:07:03] either one or two things
[2:07:05] for you to sit and i'm not saying you
[2:07:07] but for some individual to sit there
[2:07:09] there's one or two things that has to
[2:07:10] happen either you're not being
[2:07:12] stimulated
[2:07:14] or your nerve endings are dead
[2:07:17] but either case
[2:07:19] it can be fixed
[2:07:21] now i'm not trying to excite your nerve
[2:07:23] endings and just get you to just jump
[2:07:25] around but i want you to know that it's
[2:07:26] okay
[2:07:29] it's okay
[2:07:31] it is okay
[2:07:33] to have the movement of the spirit
[2:07:35] however he chooses to move
[2:07:39] how sovereign
[2:07:40] and who he chooses to move upon
[2:07:44] it's okay
[2:07:46] because we want him to have the
[2:07:47] leadership of the local body
[2:07:50] we don't want to be dictated over
[2:07:53] and be manhandled and you can't do this
[2:07:56] how dare you speak in tongues
[2:07:59] that's not what we're looking for
[2:08:02] we're looking for sons of god
[2:08:04] to be led by the spirit of god
[2:08:07] and if stimulation comes
[2:08:10] you have my authority
[2:08:12] to allow it to move you
[2:08:15] at least when i'm here preaching
[2:08:17] you have my authority to move and
[2:08:19] respond to the holy spirit however he
[2:08:22] chooses
[2:08:24] see i grew up
[2:08:25] in a sinner's home i didn't grow up in a
[2:08:27] christian church
[2:08:28] and i was in a penteco or a baptist
[2:08:30] church for a couple years and then the
[2:08:32] presbyterian church and a methodist
[2:08:34] church and then finally a pentecostal
[2:08:36] church and then back to a baptist church
[2:08:39] so i was all confused
[2:08:42] so you look at my life and say bro joe
[2:08:44] you must have grew up in a pentecostal
[2:08:45] church because you're so lively and wiry
[2:08:47] and you're all over the place no
[2:08:50] but that's because there's something on
[2:08:52] the inside it's being stimulated
[2:08:55] stimulated by the word of god
[2:08:57] because i know what i used to be
[2:09:00] and when i see this word changing me and
[2:09:02] i see this word telling me that that's
[2:09:04] not who you were you just came that way
[2:09:06] but in the in the fountain before the
[2:09:07] foundation of the world you was in the
[2:09:09] mind of god so all this the devil's
[2:09:11] trying to put on you that's not who you
[2:09:13] really are
[2:09:14] god took a picture of you at your best
[2:09:17] and that's not when you were 16 that was
[2:09:18] before the foundation of the world and
[2:09:20] he said there's nothing that the devil
[2:09:21] can do tomorrow that negative because
[2:09:24] it's going to become positive one day
[2:09:27] we're going to fit exactly what he
[2:09:29] thought of us and that should stimulate
[2:09:31] you
[2:09:33] that's your stem that should just get
[2:09:34] you so excited to know you don't belong
[2:09:37] to the enemy
[2:09:38] you don't you never had and you never
[2:09:40] will
[2:09:43] all right i want the musicians to come
[2:09:45] i'm going to parachute on out it's 12
[2:09:46] o'clock you're getting hungry
[2:09:48] but brother baum says sons of kish
[2:09:51] can never produce mark 16.
[2:09:55] sons of kish intellectual giants
[2:09:59] maybe next time when i come we'll pick
[2:10:00] this back up and finish it out
[2:10:03] but intellectual giants
[2:10:05] he talked about billy graham meeting
[2:10:06] with that muhammadan over there overseas
[2:10:10] and that muhammad said you know if this
[2:10:12] is a truth then i want you to i want to
[2:10:13] see that god heal somebody and deliver
[2:10:15] them
[2:10:16] and brother brother
[2:10:18] uh
[2:10:20] i just drew a blank
[2:10:22] brother graham excuse me
[2:10:24] brother graham was the one he was
[2:10:26] speaking of and he said that him and his
[2:10:28] army of men came back to the states
[2:10:30] defeated
[2:10:32] and he said what a waste
[2:10:36] sons of kiss and he says no sons of kish
[2:10:39] with their intellectual power can
[2:10:43] can do these things can bring the signs
[2:10:45] and wonders today that's why it's got to
[2:10:47] be more than intellectualism
[2:10:51] and that's why i'm calling you to arms
[2:10:53] to fight to allow the spirit of god to
[2:10:55] have free reign in the life of a
[2:10:57] believer
[2:10:58] you may respond different
[2:11:01] you may shout
[2:11:03] you may jump up you may scream
[2:11:06] you may sit there and do none of that
[2:11:09] but nevertheless do something
[2:11:12] don't quench the spirit
[2:11:16] don't allow yourself
[2:11:18] to come under subjection to man's ideas
[2:11:20] what this one thinks about you so you
[2:11:23] can't move because now you're worried
[2:11:25] about what they think about you
[2:11:30] hey man let's just stand to our feet
[2:11:31] this morning
[2:11:34] but the battle says there's not a man
[2:11:36] there's no son of kish or no one else
[2:11:38] can produce that outside the leadership
[2:11:40] of the holy spirit
[2:11:43] but we have made schools we have made
[2:11:45] seminaries we have made organizations to
[2:11:46] satisfy and to look like the rest of the
[2:11:49] world
[2:11:50] see no son of kish
[2:11:52] man that is set in place by another man
[2:11:54] intellectual giant
[2:11:56] man who is not called by god but placed
[2:11:58] there by another man
[2:12:00] can produce these things
[2:12:03] it has to be god ordained
[2:12:05] god instructed god place god inspired
[2:12:10] see the sons of kish they lack the
[2:12:12] anointing
[2:12:14] oh they have all the mechanics
[2:12:17] they know the bible and they know the
[2:12:19] quotes
[2:12:21] but they don't have the dynamics
[2:12:24] to make the mechanics live
[2:12:27] see
[2:12:27] they don't have the fire
[2:12:30] to bring people to the fire to give them
[2:12:32] fire how can they preach life
[2:12:36] when they haven't never met the giver of
[2:12:38] life themself
[2:12:39] they've only come
[2:12:41] to a place of justification and
[2:12:43] sanctification
[2:12:45] but when you move into that realm of the
[2:12:47] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:12:49] then now that intellectualism
[2:12:52] begins to fall off
[2:12:54] because we're no longer sons of kish now
[2:12:56] we become sons of god and sons of god
[2:12:58] are led by the spirit prophet god said
[2:13:01] satan chose the mind
[2:13:03] god chose the heart
[2:13:05] and he said these intellectual giants
[2:13:08] they try to use the mind to sway the
[2:13:10] people
[2:13:12] god uses the heart
[2:13:14] discern the spirit discern the spirit
[2:13:17] within the framework of the christian
[2:13:19] church
[2:13:20] what spirit is that there's a genuine
[2:13:22] holy spirit
[2:13:23] and then there's a spirit that would be
[2:13:25] so close that it would deceive the very
[2:13:26] elect if possible
[2:13:28] discern the spirit
[2:13:30] father we just thank you lord this
[2:13:32] morning
[2:13:33] thank you for your leadership father
[2:13:35] thank you for your holy spirit for
[2:13:37] direction this morning
[2:13:39] lord of service
[2:13:40] may have not been something typical of
[2:13:42] the style of preaching lord that you
[2:13:45] have gifted us with but lord we just
[2:13:46] really felt this is the direction you
[2:13:48] would have us to go this morning
[2:13:50] and just trust lord for the local body
[2:13:52] here at the tabernacle lord and
[2:13:54] they're longing for a pastor for
[2:13:56] leadership lord for direction
[2:13:58] comment their longing not
[2:14:01] supersede the desire that you have to
[2:14:04] bring them the right individual
[2:14:07] god may their longing line up with the
[2:14:09] call of god for a godly man a
[2:14:12] god-inspired man a godly leader not a
[2:14:14] son of kish that would lord over them
[2:14:17] over here this morning
[2:14:19] we're called to arms to fight for the
[2:14:21] truth to keep this message pure
[2:14:23] and to believe what the prophet of god
[2:14:25] preached lord to be the truth in this
[2:14:27] hour
[2:14:29] god i've looked at
[2:14:31] men and women through my years of being
[2:14:33] apart and assembled with the message
[2:14:35] lord
[2:14:36] i've seen this one come in and that one
[2:14:38] go out
[2:14:40] and yet i've seen men such as myself
[2:14:42] lord no spiritual upbringing no
[2:14:44] leadership in the home and come in and
[2:14:46] come underneath
[2:14:47] the anointing of the holy spirit and be
[2:14:50] led
[2:14:52] in the right way lord not to say that
[2:14:53] we're perfect but we're led by the
[2:14:55] spirit of god and we're quick to repent
[2:14:57] lord when we've done wrong
[2:15:00] lord i'm so thankful today that sons of
[2:15:02] god are still being led by the spirit
[2:15:05] men and women
[2:15:06] old and young alike are still
[2:15:08] allowing the spirit of god to lead them
[2:15:11] and guide them and pulsate within their
[2:15:13] innermost being
[2:15:15] lord so we just want to commit this
[2:15:16] service to you this morning
[2:15:18] how many more pages to preach father but
[2:15:21] really feeling led right now just to
[2:15:23] bring this to a close lord and just have
[2:15:25] a time of worship

[2:15:40] we just ask god that you will do what
[2:15:42] only you can do that you would move lord
[2:15:44] on every heart and every life
[2:15:46] just pray lord that you'll give us a
[2:15:48] spirit of wisdom
[2:15:50] spirit of discernment right now father
[2:15:53] to be led by the spirit of god not put
[2:15:55] our will ahead of your will not our
[2:15:58] ideas ahead of your ways not our
[2:16:00] direction over your direction for our
[2:16:02] lives and for the church and for the

[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:13] i think sometimes when we sing that song
[2:19:15] we're singing about tucson tabernacle
[2:19:18] but how about this place how about
[2:19:20] making a little more person say lord
[2:19:23] be preeminent in this place in this
[2:19:25] heart of mine
[2:19:26] so the holy spirit just doesn't stay in
[2:19:28] the church when we come but it abides in
[2:19:30] us
[2:19:31] wherever we're at
[2:19:33] lord this

[2:19:42] know that we are your children
[2:19:45] and you sent brother joe this way and
[2:19:47] this was not something we planned

[2:19:53] of today
[2:19:55] father we're trusting in that leadership
[2:19:57] of the holy spirit lord
[2:20:00] as a church as a as a family as as a
[2:20:03] group lord but more in each individual
[2:20:05] lord

[2:20:09] individuals lord
[2:20:10] [Music]

[2:20:20] that unity father because it's a spirit
[2:20:22] of christ in us lord

[2:20:27] very hearts you know the thoughts you
[2:20:29] know the the dealings of each one lord
[2:20:33] how you could call out a name you would
[2:20:35] a prophet in the prayer line and
[2:20:37] you would begin to tell speak through
[2:20:39] the voice of that prophet and begin to
[2:20:42] reveal the secrets of the heart
[2:20:44] tell them where they were from what
[2:20:46] their names were what the history of
[2:20:48] their life was because you know all
[2:20:49] these things lord and you're the same
[2:20:52] yesterday today and forever
[2:20:55] it's not something that's limited to
[2:20:57] history
[2:20:58] to to just certain people lord but it's
[2:21:00] to the children of god
[2:21:03] or so
[2:21:05] father help us to yield to that
[2:21:06] surrender to that as a as a body of
[2:21:08] believers lord
