[0:00] What gift of grace? Verse one.
[0:05] What gift of grace
[0:08] is Jesus my redeemer?
[0:13] There is no more
[0:16] for heaven now to give.
[0:21] He is my joy,
[0:24] my righteousness and freom.
[0:29] My steadfast love,
[0:32] my deep and boundless peace.
[0:37] To this I hope. My hope is only Jesus.
[0:46] For my life
[0:48] is wholly bound to him.
[0:54] Oh, how strange and divine I can see.
[1:00] All is mine, yet not I, but through
[1:04] Christ
[1:06] in me. The night is dark,
[1:09] the night is dark, but I am not forsen.
[1:17] For by my side,
[1:20] the Savior, he will stay. Do you believe
[1:23] that
[1:25] I labor on
[1:28] in weakness and rejoiceing
[1:33] for in my need
[1:36] his power is displayed. To this I hold.
[1:41] To this I hold.
[1:44] My shepherd will defend me.
[1:49] Through the deepest
[1:52] valley he will lead.
[1:57] Oh the night has been one. And I shall
[2:03] overcome
[2:05] yet not I but through Christ
[2:09] in me.
[2:12] No fate I dread.
[2:16] I know I am forgi.
[2:20] The future sure
[2:24] the price has been paid.
[2:28] For Jesus bled
[2:31] and suffered for my pardon.
[2:36] And he was raised
[2:39] to overthrow the grave.
[2:44] To this I hold. My sin has been
[2:49] defeated.
[2:53] Jesus now
[2:55] and ever is my plea.
[3:01] Oh the chains are released. I can sing.
[3:06] I am free and not I but through Christ.
[3:13] If would you stand with me and sing the
[3:15] last verse.
[3:20] With every breath,
[3:23] I long to follow Jesus.
[3:27] For he has said
[3:30] that he will bring me home. And day by
[3:34] day and day by day
[3:38] I know he will renew me
[3:43] until I stand
[3:46] with joy before the throne.
[3:51] Oh, to this I hope my hope is only
[3:56] Jesus.
[3:59] All the glory
[4:02] ever more to him.
[4:07] When the race is complete, still my lips
[4:12] shall repeat. Yet not I, but through
[4:17] Christ. To this I hold.
[4:22] To this I hold.
[4:25] My hope is only Jesus.
[4:30] All the glory
[4:33] ever more to him.
[4:38] When the race is complete, still my lips
[4:43] shall repeat. Yet not I, but through
[4:48] Christ
[4:50] in me.
[4:53] Yet not I, but through Christ
[4:58] in me. One more time.
[5:01] yet not I but through Christ
[5:06] in me.
[5:10] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.

[15:42] This one here, too. Okay.
[15:45] Yeah. I like that
[15:48] brother that said, "I believe. Help my
[15:51] unbelief." It's something we can all do.
[15:53] Huh.
[15:55] So, there's a couple praise.
[15:58] Sister Ronnie wants to praise the Lord
[16:01] for healing
[16:03] and thank everyone too for praying.
[16:08] And then um
[16:11] sister she wanted to thank sister Angela
[16:13] too for bringing food to the hospital.
[16:16] She said I can't praise him enough.
[16:18] That's really nice. Yeah.
[16:23] Thankful. Pray without ceasing. It says
[16:25] with thanksgiving. So that's nice to be
[16:28] thankful, isn't it? We have one more.
[16:30] Surely more.
[16:34] I want to praise God for healing my
[16:35] brother-in-law of a body filled with
[16:37] cancer. He had a PET scan on the ETH and
[16:40] they found no cancer. Only one tiny spot
[16:43] of the cancer was left. Praise God.

[17:25] probably be the last time.
[17:29] [Music]
[17:32] Okay. I think you all know Heath. He
[17:35] sits up here in the front kind of close
[17:39] and God knows him. And then Rachel Geta

[18:04] isn't it? She asked for prayer.
[18:08] Let's pray then. Lord God, we thank you
[18:11] that you set it up this way. It's almost
[18:14] unbelievable that you've set it up this
[18:17] way, but we ask you to help our unbelief
[18:19] and help us to trust you. And you're the
[18:22] great physician. I've seen so many
[18:24] wonderful answers to prayer and even
[18:26] been surprised,
[18:28] Lord, with your kindness. And I just ask
[18:31] you to help each one here that we won't
[18:33] waste our time or you're you're in a
[18:36] dimension of no time, but just to make
[18:38] the most of our opportunity to pray to
[18:41] you and believe you and trust you and be
[18:46] thankful. In Jesus Christ's name, we
[18:49] thank you. Amen.

[31:40] The book of Revelation and uh I believe
[31:43] I'll get there today. The book of
[31:45] Revelation says that incense that arises
[31:50] up before the throne of God are the

[31:57] saying. Lord, let this incense arise day
[32:02] and night and night and day. Let your
[32:05] incense arise. Let it always come up.
[32:07] Let our prayers always come up before
[32:09] you, heavenly father.
[32:14] Lord, let this incense arise this
[32:16] morning. Our prayers, Lord, let them
[32:19] come up before you as the incense would
[32:22] rise from the altar of God. Let it come
[32:24] up before you as a sweet smelling savor
[32:27] before God.
[32:30] Lord, hear our prayers, I pray. be with

[33:03] brother Josiah and the gifts that he has
[33:06] and all the musicians and and just
[33:10] bringing this spirit of worship. It's
[33:13] just it's beautiful. Now singing isn't
[33:16] our only form of worship, but it is
[33:18] definitely a form of worship and that's
[33:20] why we sing is to bring these bring
[33:23] these our our prayers and our love to
[33:26] the Lord Jesus.
[33:28] Brother Arie when he brought the the
[33:32] prayer request to us, he said
[33:35] um he says that he he thanks God that we
[33:40] are that God has made a way
[33:44] for us to do this. And and I think his
[33:46] words were we thank you that you set it
[33:48] up this way. I think brother what
[33:50] brother Arie was saying is he's thankful
[33:52] that we are able to pray one for another
[33:56] and that God has ordained us to pray for
[33:59] each other and to bring these requests
[34:01] up before him. You think that if there
[34:04] was just a need, he would just give it
[34:07] to us. But that's not his way. His way
[34:09] is for us to pray one for another. I'll
[34:13] be talking about that in the sermon
[34:16] today. And it's really it's it's a great
[34:17] honor that we have to do this. Want to
[34:21] welcome our visitors with us. God bless
[34:24] you all. It's good to have you. Brother
[34:27] Phillip Johnson, where are you? There
[34:28] you are. Brother Phillip, stand up. You
[34:30] and your family. God bless you. Welcome.
[34:32] And this is Brother Rome's son.
[34:37] I had him stand because
[34:40] brother Philip and I go way back. Um, we
[34:42] used to fellowship and when we were
[34:44] young, young and single and and we had
[34:47] the youth groups around Tucson and I uh
[34:51] always liked Brother Phillip and his
[34:53] family and I always appreciated you.
[34:55] It's it's good to see you again and I'm
[34:58] really glad that the same thing happened
[35:00] to the top of your head that happened to
[35:02] mine.
[35:07] We haven't seen Last time we saw each
[35:08] other. who had hair.
[35:11] That's good. You make me feel good.
[35:13] Thank you.
[35:16] Yeah.
[35:20] God bless you. I'm sorry to tell a joke
[35:22] at both of our expenses, but it's uh
[35:24] it's good. And uh Brother Wayne
[35:26] mentioned, "Where are you, Brother
[35:27] Wayne? I I saw you earlier." Um there
[35:30] you are. Brother Wayne uh said uh when I
[35:35] saw him in the hallway coming in, he
[35:36] said, 'I appreciate what you said last
[35:38] service. And I said, 'What did I say?
[35:40] And he said, you said, "Welcome home."
[35:43] And I believe that. I believe that this
[35:46] should be a place that you feel is like
[35:49] your home. You feel that there's things
[35:52] that that you may want to fix about your
[35:54] home, but it's it's home. And and we're
[35:58] honored that you would say that. And
[36:00] brother Philip, I hope that you feel the
[36:02] same way that this is a place that loves
[36:04] you. And it's it is a place. It's home.
[36:09] And uh welcome also to any other
[36:11] visitors that we have that I didn't
[36:13] recognize. God God bless you all. It's
[36:16] good to have you. I told Daniel to stay
[36:18] up here because my
[36:22] message today will be what we've been
[36:25] talking about the past few weeks, which
[36:27] is about prayer and which is about
[36:29] communion with God. And I wanted Daniel
[36:33] to share. He he showed me a video of a
[36:36] young lady that he has been a friend to
[36:40] for some time now. And this young lady
[36:43] has her life has just turned into
[36:47] has just done just she's turned into a
[36:50] real blessing. And I wanted Daniel to
[36:53] give just the testimony, give a little
[36:55] bit of a background to this young lady
[36:57] and where she is now and his influence
[37:00] on on her life. Right there.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Um, this
[37:04] testimony, it means a lot to me because
[37:06] it it just showed me how powerful God is
[37:09] when we don't think he's doing anything.
[37:11] And it just because in this testimony, I
[37:14] I really didn't do anything. All I did
[37:16] was just be myself. And it it ended up
[37:20] just being a a miracle. But um anyway,
[37:23] so I had this friend I met her when I
[37:25] was around 14 years old and she was she
[37:28] was a cousin to one of my best friends
[37:29] and they're from Quebec, Canada. And um
[37:32] I met her when I was 14 and we became
[37:35] good friends. And um around um she was
[37:38] around 20 years old and she started to
[37:41] stray from the Lord. She started to you
[37:42] know live a worldly life, live a life of
[37:45] sin and uh she was she went to school.
[37:48] She was a nurse surprisingly. I'm
[37:50] friends with more nurses. Um
[37:53] uh and she had just finished nursing
[37:55] school and she was in the worldly
[37:57] standards she was living a good life.
[38:00] She was she just got her dream job in
[38:03] another city. She had a boyfriend who
[38:06] wasn't a Christian, but he had a good
[38:07] job. Um, and she just got an apartment
[38:10] in a city that she was like, "Oh, it's
[38:12] awesome. It was downtown and it was like
[38:14] her dream place to live." But she still
[38:17] felt alone through all those worldly
[38:19] pleasures and everything that she was
[38:21] getting in life. She she felt alone. She
[38:23] felt this void inside her because she
[38:26] she was just living a sinful life. And
[38:29] um so one day there was our friends were
[38:31] getting married and so she came back
[38:33] down to Jeff. I hadn't seen her for I
[38:36] think 3 years at that point and she um
[38:39] she came down and we we met at Starbucks
[38:43] and she was like she's like hey Daniel
[38:44] I'm coming down let's let's go do
[38:46] something. I was like absolutely let's
[38:48] let's go and let's you know hang out and
[38:50] you know just do what we used to do. And
[38:52] so we met at Starbucks and we started
[38:54] talking you know about her life and
[38:56] about everything. And she was telling
[38:58] me, she was like, "I'm doing this wrong.
[39:00] I'm doing this wrong." I'm like, "That's
[39:01] okay." I was like, "That's okay." And
[39:03] she kind of looks at me and she was
[39:04] like, "No, like like I'm sinning." And I
[39:06] was like, I was like, "That's fine." I
[39:08] was like, "That's just more for God to
[39:09] do for you." And she's just And she's
[39:11] just like, she kind of looked at me
[39:12] weird. And we ended up going the whole
[39:15] time. And we just had a good time. And I
[39:17] was just there. And I treated her just
[39:19] like we had always been when we were
[39:20] kids, you know, when we would hang out.
[39:22] I treated her just the same. I didn't
[39:25] treat her any different. And so she when
[39:28] she was on her way home, her and her
[39:31] cousins were talking and she kind of
[39:33] just broke down and she ended up giving
[39:37] her heart to the Lord and she went home
[39:40] and she went and she quit her new job in
[39:42] that new city. She moved her stuff out
[39:44] of her apartment and then she came back
[39:47] home to her parents and then she called
[39:50] me and she said, "Daniel, I want to let
[39:52] you know I just gave my heart to the
[39:54] Lord." And I was just like, "Oh my
[39:55] goodness." It was just it was such a
[39:57] miracle. I was like like like what
[39:59] happened? Like what what crazy
[40:01] miraculous thing happened? She was like
[40:03] nothing. She was like I just felt the
[40:05] love from you and then um two other
[40:08] friends that were there. She was like
[40:09] you guys didn't treat me any different
[40:11] than you used to. She was like all my
[40:13] family, some of my family wouldn't talk
[40:15] to me. She was like it was weird seeing
[40:16] them at the wedding. She was like but
[40:18] you guys I just felt the love of Jesus.
[40:20] And we didn't do anything different. All
[40:22] we did was just treat her the exact
[40:25] same. and treat her like anyone else.
[40:26] And that's the reason she gave her heart
[40:28] to the Lord. And now she's living a
[40:30] Christian life. She's dating a Christian
[40:32] boy. And she's just so happy. The
[40:35] happiness inside of her is just
[40:37] overflowing. It's just it's such a
[40:39] miracle. Amen.
[40:41] [Applause]
[40:50] I get
[40:53] uh
[40:56] when
[40:58] one person when one soul
[41:01] comes to the Lord, entire heavens
[41:04] rejoice.
[41:05] And Daniel was loving to this girl. He
[41:09] prayed for her.
[41:11] And my my subject today
[41:14] is uh about a scripture that has always
[41:17] meant a lot to me when I've prayed and
[41:20] it's always given me faith and that's in
[41:24] Acts chapter nine
[41:26] when the Lord
[41:29] comes to
[41:31] a prophet
[41:33] and he tells this prophet to go to this
[41:40] man named Saul of Tarsus. And his reason
[41:44] for that, God gives a reason. He says
[41:47] because he is praying.
[41:50] And to think that the prayers of this
[41:53] young lady,
[41:55] the prayers of her family and the
[41:57] prayers of my son.
[42:00] To think that these prayers were
[42:02] answered. And not so much that she
[42:06] stopped sinning as Daniel said. Not so
[42:09] much that maybe she would be healed or
[42:13] or would be delivered, but more so that
[42:17] she would have her own relationship
[42:21] with this man, Jesus Christ.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; And that will solve everything
[42:28] &gt;&gt; if you can just talk to God yourself.
[42:32] That is what prayer is about.
[42:34] And this morning I'd like to read the
[42:36] testimony
[42:38] of this man called Saul of Tarsus. And
[42:41] he was a very very sinful man.
[42:46] We might not, he might not have been
[42:48] sinful in say the worldly way that we
[42:52] often think of sin, but the religious
[42:54] way that Paul that the Apostle Paul, he
[42:57] ended up being the Apostle Paul, Saul of
[42:58] Tarsus, the religious way was just as
[43:02] sinful.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And this is what this man Saul of Tarsus
[43:06] was. He was a very, very sinful, evil
[43:09] man.
[43:11] and his sins were coming out through his
[43:15] religious beliefs. So there is the sin
[43:18] that we see on the streets that we we
[43:20] see so often, but then there is also a a
[43:24] sin of meanness and a sin of not caring
[43:27] and a sin of malice. The sins that are
[43:31] mo mainly those are mentioned in the
[43:33] Bible, but those are the ones that we
[43:35] ignore so much for the other sins that
[43:38] are more maybe obvious. But the sins
[43:39] that are mentioned the most are the sins
[43:41] that this man Saul was committing.
[43:44] So let's read his testimony and then see
[43:48] what this the most important thing and
[43:51] all of this thing that we call prayer. I
[43:54] believe that this is this will tell us
[43:57] who we are praying to.
[44:01] And that's my subject this morning
[44:04] is who are we praying to? And this man,
[44:08] this man Ananas, this prophet named
[44:10] Ananas came to this man Saul because he
[44:14] was praying.
[44:15] So Acts chapter 9 verse one, I read the
[44:18] uh King James version. And it says this,
[44:21] "And Saul yet breathing out threatenings
[44:24] and slaughter against the disciples of
[44:25] the Lord, went unto the high priest, and
[44:28] desired of him letters to Damascus to
[44:30] the synagogues, that if he found any of
[44:34] this way, whether they were men or
[44:37] women, he might bring them bound into
[44:40] Jerusalem." Very important word, the
[44:43] way. And it says that if any found if he
[44:46] found any of this way, he's talking
[44:49] about what Christianity was called back
[44:51] then is the way.
[44:54] And as he journeyed,
[44:57] he came to he came near to Damascus. And
[45:00] suddenly there shined round about him a
[45:02] light from heaven. And he fell to the
[45:05] earth. And he heard a voice saying,
[45:07] "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
[45:10] And he said, "Who art who art thou,
[45:11] Lord?" And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus,
[45:14] whom thou persecutest? It is hard for
[45:16] thee to kick against the pricks.' And he
[45:18] trembling and astonished said, Lord,
[45:21] what wilt thou have me to do? And the
[45:24] Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
[45:26] the city, and it shall be told thee what
[45:29] thou must do? And the men which
[45:32] journeyed with him stood speechless,
[45:33] hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And
[45:37] Saul arose from the earth, and when his
[45:39] eyes were opened, he saw no man, but
[45:43] they led him by the hand and brought him
[45:45] to to into Damascus. So he was blind
[45:49] after this experience.
[45:51] And he was three days without sight, and
[45:54] neither did eat nor drink. And there was
[45:58] a certain disciple at Damascus named
[46:00] Ananas. And to him said the Lord in a
[46:04] vision, Ananas.
[46:06] And he said, "Behold, I am here, Lord."
[46:09] And the Lord said unto him, "Arise, and
[46:11] go into the street which is called
[46:13] Straight, and inquire in the house of
[46:16] Judas, for one called Saul of Tarsus,
[46:20] for behold,
[46:22] he prayth."
[46:24] Those words that God spoke to Ananas
[46:28] have been such a comfort to me before
[46:32] that whenever I am praying I may not
[46:35] have the answer to my prayers right away
[46:38] as Saul didn't have the answer to his
[46:40] prayers but they went up and God heard
[46:42] the answer the heard the prayers of this
[46:46] evil man Saul heard his prayers and then
[46:51] used another man to come and answer
[46:55] those prayers. We talk about prayer, as
[46:58] we did a couple weeks ago, being our
[47:01] fellowship with God and how God wants
[47:02] us, he wants to be with us. He wants to
[47:05] talk with us more than we want to talk
[47:07] with him. And then last week we heard
[47:10] about the prayer of Jonah and how it
[47:14] turned God turned one of the worst
[47:16] situations that a man has ever been in
[47:19] being in the belly of the whale in the
[47:21] bottom of the ocean and turned it around
[47:25] and make made his testimony
[47:29] like and a type of none other than Jesus
[47:32] Christ's death burial burial and
[47:34] resurrection.
[47:37] How important friends is our prayer? And
[47:40] now we see this man who hated God's
[47:43] people and he's blind and he's laying in
[47:46] bed and he's not eating and he's not
[47:49] drinking and he's been fasting for these
[47:51] three days and he's seeking God and he's
[47:53] praying and God tells his servant Ananas
[47:57] to go to this man because of that reason
[48:02] because he is praying.
[48:06] back to Ananas
[48:08] and he's talking to Ananas, the Lord is
[48:10] and he says that this man Saul has seen
[48:12] in a vision a man named Ananas coming in
[48:16] and putting his hand on him that he
[48:18] might receive his sight. Then Ananas
[48:20] answered, Lord, I have heard by many of
[48:24] this man how much evil he hath done to
[48:26] thy saints at Jerusalem, and here he
[48:29] hath authority from the chief priests to
[48:31] bind all that call on thy name. But the
[48:34] Lord said unto him, "Go thy way, for he
[48:38] is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my
[48:41] name before the Gentiles and kings and
[48:44] the children of Israel.
[48:46] For I will show him how great things he
[48:50] must suffer for my name's sake." So he's
[48:52] saying, "I'm sending you Ananas because
[48:55] this man is praying and he's already
[48:57] seen a vision that you'll be coming to
[48:59] him." It's amazing how God uses other
[49:04] people
[49:05] to bless other ones. You know, as
[49:09] brother Arie prayed at the beginning, he
[49:10] says, you know, Lord, we're thankful
[49:13] that that you set it up this way. You
[49:16] would think that I would just be able to
[49:18] pray
[49:19] and then God would just answer my
[49:21] prayers and God would just give me what
[49:24] I need. But that's not the way he does
[49:26] things. He uses other He uses each other
[49:31] to help us and he and he and he uses one
[49:35] another to to give us what we need. And
[49:39] it's it doesn't make really it doesn't
[49:41] make sense the way we do things. If
[49:42] Daniel
[49:44] needed say needed 20 bucks,
[49:48] I would he would just ask me and I would
[49:51] give it to him. and me being his father,
[49:54] I wouldn't go to my daughter Meline
[49:57] and say, "Yeah, Daniel needs 20 bucks.
[49:59] Here, Meline, you go give Daniel this
[50:02] this money." No, I would give it
[50:03] directly to him. But that's not how God
[50:06] does. God uses others to give gifts to
[50:10] his church because he really he wants us
[50:13] all working together
[50:15] &gt;&gt; in this great economy of God. He has all
[50:17] of us in our positions and he wants us
[50:20] all working together and by doing that
[50:22] we will all be blessed. And here he has
[50:27] this man Ananas working with this man
[50:30] Paul
[50:32] and Paul needs healing. And it may be
[50:35] that we need a new job or it may be that
[50:37] we need salvation or may we maybe need
[50:39] deliverance or whatever it might be. And
[50:41] then God will send someone else
[50:45] to pray for us and to give us these
[50:48] blessings.
[50:49] It's odd how God does things. And maybe
[50:53] next week, that's not what I want to
[50:55] talk about today very much, but maybe
[50:58] next week that that will be our subject.
[51:01] But this man Paul or Saul, his name was
[51:05] changed to Paul. And I might use it
[51:09] interchangeably on accident, but he was
[51:11] Saul of Tarsus. He gave his heart to the
[51:14] Lord. He was called to the Gentiles. And
[51:16] his name Saul was a Jewish name. And as
[51:20] he went to the Gentiles, he took on the
[51:22] name Paul, which was a gentile name, so
[51:25] he would relate better with the
[51:28] Gentiles.
[51:29] So Ananas went his way and entered into
[51:32] the house, and putting his hands on him,
[51:34] said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, even
[51:36] Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the
[51:39] way as thou camest, hath sent me, that
[51:42] thou mightest receive thy sight and be
[51:46] filled with the Holy Ghost."
[51:49] Now, it isn't a traditional prayer. He
[51:50] just goes in. He was commissioned. He
[51:52] just goes in and he lays his hands on
[51:54] this man Paul. And then Paul receives
[51:58] his sight. So the prayer here
[52:03] is just to fulfill and that's how it
[52:05] always is. It's just to fulfill what God
[52:07] had already ordained. So when we pray
[52:10] for someone, God has already ordained
[52:13] that they receive what we're praying
[52:15] for. We are just acting in the name of
[52:18] Jesus Christ to do the will of God. And
[52:22] that's what this man Ananas was doing.
[52:24] And he says, "Go to this man because
[52:26] he's praying." And immediately th there
[52:29] fell from Saul's eyes as it had been
[52:33] scales and he received sight for with
[52:37] and arose and was baptized.
[52:41] So, tremendous story and maybe next week
[52:45] I'll get into this. I I want to tell a
[52:47] story about my mother and how the Lord
[52:51] healed her and my brother Adam is going
[52:53] to be coming this week for my grandma's
[52:56] funeral. So, he will be here next
[52:58] Sunday. So, I want to tell that story
[52:59] when Adam is here because Adam witnessed
[53:01] this a tremendous supernatural thing.
[53:03] Stephanie witnessed it. Daniel was
[53:05] there, too. But I'll tell this story
[53:07] about how my mom was healed of cancer
[53:10] through this supernatural thing just as
[53:13] Paul was healed. But then my mom
[53:19] three, four, five years later, whatever
[53:20] it was, died of cancer, even though she
[53:23] was delivered at that time. And she was
[53:26] she was on her deathbed at at the time
[53:29] that this this miracle happened. And
[53:32] then the Lord gave her many more years.
[53:34] And we look at this man Saul and we see
[53:37] that when Ananas came and laid his hands
[53:41] on him, these scales fell off of his
[53:44] eyes.
[53:45] But then he always still struggled with
[53:48] his eyes after that. So we hear so
[53:50] often, it sounds good. You know, you got
[53:52] to be careful about things sounding
[53:54] good. Oh yeah, that sounds right. But
[53:55] praise the Lord, brother. No. When you
[53:58] hear sometimes, well, God, God doesn't
[54:00] do things halfway. He wants to hear you
[54:02] fully. That sounds good, but just make
[54:05] sure what we say lines up with what the
[54:07] Bible says. God is sovereign. He does
[54:10] things his way.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; And this man Paul, he had to have his
[54:14] eyes, so God gave him back his eyes. But
[54:16] he always struggled with that. He he
[54:19] says um one time he says that God has
[54:21] given me a thorn in my flesh. Some
[54:23] people say it was a sickness. Most
[54:24] scholars think that this was because of
[54:27] his eyes. He struggled with his eyes. He
[54:29] couldn't read very well. And he even
[54:31] wrote when he wrote a letter he said you
[54:33] know that this comes from me because the
[54:35] letters are really big
[54:37] &gt;&gt; his he struggled with his eyes after
[54:39] that. So the Lord's willing I will talk
[54:42] about that
[54:44] next week. But the most important thing
[54:47] with this man Ananas coming to him and
[54:50] this most the most important thing about
[54:52] this whole situation with the apostle
[54:55] Paul was not that he received his sight.
[54:59] The most important thing was that he was
[55:02] he spoke to God himself. He spoke to
[55:05] Jesus Christ himself and he had that
[55:08] relationship now between him and God.
[55:13] If we pray for someone and they're
[55:15] healed, praise God. And I believe that
[55:17] God wants us to be healed, but we will
[55:19] get sick again.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; And if the Lord carries, we will
[55:23] eventually die. The same thing if we are
[55:26] delivered say from from nicotine
[55:29] we will struggle with something else and
[55:33] that's how that's that's just how this
[55:34] life is. But if we truly have a
[55:37] relationship with God if we know him
[55:40] then that relationship will always be
[55:42] with us and not just in this life it'll
[55:44] be with us for eternity. That is the
[55:47] true prayer. That is the true meaning
[55:50] behind prayer and that is the ultimate
[55:51] in praying for each other is that we can
[55:54] develop that relationship between us and
[55:57] God. Healing is wonderful. We should
[55:59] pray for healing and God does heal.
[56:01] We've all seen miracles and those
[56:03] miracles will continue. Deliverance is
[56:06] wonderful and we've all seen
[56:07] deliverance. Many of us have been
[56:08] delivered of certain things. These it
[56:12] might be a new job, might be whatever it
[56:14] is. God loves us and he takes care of
[56:16] us. But the main thing when we are
[56:18] praying and you'll see in in Paul's
[56:20] prayer at the end in in Ephesians when
[56:23] we get there the main thing is that we
[56:25] have that relationship with God. That is
[56:28] the main reason be behind prayer. Now
[56:31] Paul has this relationship with God. And
[56:34] when he had received meat he was
[56:36] strengthened. That's King James meat.
[56:40] He's not on the carnivore diet. It's
[56:42] it's food. The modern translation is
[56:45] food. And when you see in the King James
[56:48] it's it says meat it's it's the it's 300
[56:51] years ago for um for just eating. So so
[56:54] he ate and then Saul certain days was
[56:58] with the disciples were at Damascus. Now
[57:01] watch the change.
[57:04] It's not that he was healed. He was
[57:06] healed and that's the glory. But now
[57:08] Saul of Tarsus is a different person.
[57:12] He had been saved.
[57:14] He had an experience with the Lord
[57:16] Jesus. He was healed and now he knows
[57:18] the greatness of God. And when you truly
[57:22] know the greatness of God, when you
[57:25] truly experience that, the healing or
[57:28] the miracle is minor compared to now
[57:31] what you have. And you'll see I really
[57:34] narrowed it down to two things really
[57:36] happen
[57:38] when you really give your heart to the
[57:40] Lord Jesus and you have that experience
[57:43] with him. Number one, and this is
[57:45] evident in Saul, is that you want to
[57:47] tell everyone about what just happened
[57:49] to you. You want to give your testimony.
[57:52] You want to lead others to the to the
[57:54] same God that you know. You want to
[57:55] share your experience so others will
[57:58] have that same experience. You're
[58:00] excited about it. The Lord just changed
[58:02] me. I met Jesus Christ myself. I want
[58:05] you to know him like I know him. That's
[58:07] why I'm standing here in this pull pit
[58:10] is I have that same desire. I want you
[58:13] to know this Jesus Christ. He's real. I
[58:16] don't want you just to listen to me. I
[58:19] want you to know him. That's the whole
[58:21] purpose behind a church. That's the
[58:23] whole purpose behind Christianity is
[58:25] that we know Christ ourselves. That's
[58:27] the first thing. Once you give your
[58:29] heart to the Lord, it's that you want to
[58:31] tell others. And then second
[58:34] is you want more.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; You're not satisfied with your one-time
[58:38] experience. And that's how the enemy can
[58:41] come in is he can say, "Oh, well, you
[58:43] had an experience when you were 12 years
[58:45] old. You had an experience when you're
[58:47] 18. You had an experience when you're
[58:48] 25. That's good. But what about today?
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Have you had an experience today?
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Have you had an experience this week?
[58:58] You know, I know you can look back and
[59:00] that's good and you can set that typos
[59:01] back then and you might be able to go
[59:03] back to that like I do when I pray. I
[59:06] can go back to that scripture that says
[59:07] that Ananas came to Saul because he was
[59:10] praying. But I want more every day. I
[59:12] got to have more more because the the
[59:15] the Bible talks about about having our
[59:18] cup filled and or the the lamp filled
[59:21] with oil. My vessel is leaky
[59:26] and it's constantly dripping out and I
[59:29] have to constantly have that that vessel
[59:31] filled with the Holy Spirit. It doesn't
[59:34] just get filled once and stay there. No,
[59:36] that vessel is constantly being filled.
[59:38] And Paul, and you'll you'll see is and
[59:40] I'll get into the scriptures a little
[59:42] bit more. Paul wants more and more and
[59:44] more. And he says, "I haven't even
[59:45] attained it yet." He says, "But I'm
[59:47] pressing towards this. I want more all
[59:50] the time." So that's the two things when
[59:51] you really become a Christian, when you
[59:53] really give your heart to the Lord. And
[59:56] when you are filled with the Holy Ghost,
[59:58] now you want to tell everybody else. And
[1:00:00] now that desire that you had for the
[1:00:02] Holy Ghost doesn't stop. It actually
[1:00:05] becomes more,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; more, more. I need more, Lord. I need
[1:00:10] more. I need an experience today. I got
[1:00:12] to I got to have I got to have more. I
[1:00:14] got to have more of you
[1:00:17] speaking of the law of Moses. Paul said
[1:00:20] this. I'm going to read the New Living
[1:00:22] Translation. I just want you to listen
[1:00:23] to my voice here. This is in the book of
[1:00:26] Philippians. It says this.
[1:00:28] Paul says this. He says, "I once thought
[1:00:32] these things were valuable." He's
[1:00:34] speaking of the law of Moses.
[1:00:36] He says, "I once thought these things
[1:00:38] were valuable, but now I consider them
[1:00:41] worthless because of what Christ has
[1:00:44] done."
[1:00:46] This led what Paul is saying. They're
[1:00:48] not worthless, but they were going
[1:00:51] towards a goal. And that was not the
[1:00:53] goal. The goal is now what Paul
[1:00:56] received.
[1:00:58] And he says that I I now consider them
[1:01:00] worthless of because of what Christ has
[1:01:03] done. Yes, everything else is worthless
[1:01:06] when compared with the infinite value of
[1:01:09] knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[1:01:12] For his sake, I have discarded
[1:01:14] everything else, counting it all as
[1:01:16] garbage so that I could gain Christ and
[1:01:19] become one with him. I no longer count
[1:01:23] on my own righteousness
[1:01:25] through obeying the law. Rather, I
[1:01:28] become righteousness. I become righteous
[1:01:31] through faith in Christ.
[1:01:33] For God's way of making us right with
[1:01:36] himself depends on faith.
[1:01:41] I want to know Christ and experience the
[1:01:44] mighty power that raised him from the
[1:01:46] dead. I want to suffer with him, sharing
[1:01:48] in his death, so that one way or the
[1:01:50] other, I will experience the
[1:01:52] resurrection from the dead. The
[1:01:54] translators put an exclamation point
[1:01:56] there in Philippians.
[1:01:59] I don't mean to say that I have already
[1:02:01] achieved these things or that I have
[1:02:03] already reached perfection. The Apostle
[1:02:05] Paul speaking, but I press on to possess
[1:02:10] that perfection for which Christ Jesus
[1:02:13] first possessed me. He says, 'N no, dear
[1:02:16] brothers and sisters, I have not
[1:02:18] achieved it,
[1:02:20] but I focus on this one thing,
[1:02:22] forgetting the past and looking forward
[1:02:26] to what lies ahead, I press on to reach
[1:02:29] the end of the race and receive the
[1:02:30] heavenly prize for which God through
[1:02:33] Christ Jesus is calling us. The King
[1:02:35] James version of Philippians chapter 3
[1:02:37] says this, "Brethren, I count not myself
[1:02:39] to have apprehended it." Just what I
[1:02:42] read. But this one thing I do,
[1:02:44] forgetting those things which are
[1:02:46] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[1:02:48] things which are before, I press toward
[1:02:50] the mark for the prize of the high
[1:02:52] calling of God in Christ Jesus. The main
[1:02:56] thing he is trying to tell us is that we
[1:02:58] know the author. We have the promises.
[1:03:02] We have the word. This word goes towards
[1:03:05] one thing. And Paul said it is going
[1:03:07] towards that we know him.
[1:03:10] Hebrews 12:12 says this, "Looking unto
[1:03:13] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[1:03:15] faith, who for who for the joy that was
[1:03:18] set before him endured the cross,
[1:03:21] despising the shame, and is sat down at
[1:03:23] the right hand of the throne of God."
[1:03:28] So once we know Christ,
[1:03:30] then Daniel might need the $20, but the
[1:03:35] main thing is that he knows his dad. is
[1:03:38] that he knows the father. And we might
[1:03:41] need something, friends. And we all need
[1:03:43] something. All of us. We all have
[1:03:45] prayers. Lord, help us. Every person in
[1:03:47] this room has something that God wants
[1:03:50] them to do for for them. But the main
[1:03:53] thing is that you know him.
[1:03:56] The main thing is that you can ask him
[1:03:58] and then it's up to him how he answers.
[1:04:02] I might give $20 to my daughter to give
[1:04:04] to my son.
[1:04:07] God might use Ananas
[1:04:09] to come and pray for Paul. It's up to
[1:04:12] him. But the main thing is that we know
[1:04:15] Christ as Paul met him on the road to
[1:04:17] Damascus. The main thing is that we know
[1:04:19] him.
[1:04:21] And now Saul of Tarsus had met Jesus
[1:04:25] Christ. Now watch what happens to his
[1:04:27] life. And it will happen to us. It'll
[1:04:30] happen to you if you truly accept Christ
[1:04:32] too.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; It'll happen to all of us. Number one,
[1:04:36] we want to tell everybody.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stand in the pulpit
[1:04:40] and preach, but you need to preach.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; You need to testify.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And if it really if God really got a
[1:04:47] hold of you, it is so important. You
[1:04:49] want to just tell everybody because this
[1:04:52] joy is overflowing. And friends, there
[1:04:54] is no sadness in Jesus Christ. There is
[1:04:57] such hope in him. He loves us and he
[1:05:00] wants to bless us and we want to tell
[1:05:02] others about it.
[1:05:05] And then number two, as I said, we want
[1:05:08] more and more and more of him. Let's go
[1:05:10] back to cha Acts chapter 9 verse verse
[1:05:13] 20. And straightway
[1:05:16] Paul preached Christ in the synagogues
[1:05:19] that he is the son of God.
[1:05:23] This is the man
[1:05:25] that was just a few just a little while
[1:05:28] earlier.
[1:05:29] He was killing trying to kill these
[1:05:33] people who were of the way,
[1:05:36] these people who were worshiping Christ.
[1:05:39] And now here is Paul preaching what all
[1:05:43] of the other disciples and men and women
[1:05:47] of God were saying that Jesus is the son
[1:05:52] of God. That is the mystery of God
[1:05:55] revealed
[1:05:57] that this man Jesus Christ fulfilled all
[1:06:00] of the Old Testament. Book of Leviticus.
[1:06:04] I used to always just dread when I'd
[1:06:07] read my Bible cover to cover, I just
[1:06:09] dread getting to Leviticus
[1:06:11] because it was all of the offerings and
[1:06:14] all the sacrifices. And I just didn't
[1:06:16] understand it until the last time I read
[1:06:19] my Bible all the way through. I got to
[1:06:21] Leviticus and I said, "Lord, please help
[1:06:23] me understand this. Please help me enjoy
[1:06:26] it because I always just read it to get
[1:06:29] through it." And from Leviticus 1:1 all
[1:06:33] the way through the whole book, the Lord
[1:06:35] showed me that this is all about Jesus.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; This all represents him. And it turned
[1:06:39] into one of my favorite. Merrily always
[1:06:42] makes fun of me because I always say,
[1:06:43] "Oh, this is my favorite chapter. This
[1:06:45] is my favorite verse." It's what I'm
[1:06:47] reading. And when I'm in Leviticus, it's
[1:06:50] my favorite book because I can look at
[1:06:53] it and see this is Jesus. This this came
[1:06:56] to pass.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; This was manifested in this man, Jesus
[1:07:01] Christ. And that's how Paul, he's like,
[1:07:02] "Wow, the whole Bible was fulfilled in
[1:07:05] the son of God, Jesus Christ." And
[1:07:08] that's what that's what it is. And when
[1:07:10] you truly meet Christ, as Saul of Tarsus
[1:07:12] did, you realize that you cannot preach
[1:07:15] anything greater than Christ.
[1:07:19] There is nothing that greater that we
[1:07:20] can preach than Jesus.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; We can preach salvation and and it all
[1:07:25] comes back to Jesus. We can preach
[1:07:27] healing, but it always come backs to G
[1:07:29] comes back to Jesus. Everything comes
[1:07:31] back to this man. I talked about the
[1:07:33] carnivore diet just now. Um
[1:07:37] that's the meat. That's the good stuff
[1:07:40] in the sandwich is Jesus.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; He is He has the nutrients. He has the
[1:07:48] power. It's all about him. Really,
[1:07:50] everything everything else is milk.
[1:07:53] Christ is the main thing. Verse number
[1:07:57] 21.
[1:08:00] But all that heard him were amazed and
[1:08:02] said, "Is not this he that destroyed
[1:08:05] them which called on his name in
[1:08:08] Jerusalem, and came hither for that
[1:08:10] intent, that he might bring them bound
[1:08:13] unto the chief priests?" Isn't this the
[1:08:15] man that was just against us?
[1:08:19] But Saul increased more in strength and
[1:08:22] confounded the Jews which dwelt at
[1:08:24] Damascus, proving that this is very
[1:08:28] Christ. English Standard Version says,
[1:08:31] "But Saul increased all the more in
[1:08:33] strength and confounded the Jews who
[1:08:35] lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus
[1:08:39] was the Christ."
[1:08:42] Amen. That's what he was preaching. And
[1:08:44] that's what all the disciples were
[1:08:45] preaching and that's what his disciples
[1:08:46] are preaching today that this man Jesus
[1:08:49] Christ is everything and the most
[1:08:51] important thing is that you commune with
[1:08:53] him.
[1:08:55] Romans chapter f chapter 15
[1:08:59] verse 13. I just wanted to throw this
[1:09:01] scripture in there because it means so
[1:09:03] much to me. I'll read the New King James
[1:09:05] Version. It says this.
[1:09:07] Now, may the God of hope fill you with
[1:09:10] all joy and peace in believing
[1:09:13] that you may abound in hope by the power
[1:09:17] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:20] When you truly meet God
[1:09:24] and when you truly understand who you
[1:09:27] are praying to,
[1:09:29] there is such hope in your heart.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; It's not just hope. Lord, Lord, I'm in
[1:09:35] this situation. I need help.
[1:09:37] you know he can help you.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; But if you really know him, you know
[1:09:43] he's always there.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; You know he is just a a a a an infinite
[1:09:48] fountain of life coming up and knowing
[1:09:52] God is the very meaning of prayer and
[1:09:55] you you receive that hope. The Lord
[1:09:58] could deliver you might pray, "Lord,
[1:10:00] deliver my son from drugs. Deliver my
[1:10:02] daughter from sin. help me find a
[1:10:05] husband or help me find a wife or
[1:10:07] whatever it might be. But if you could
[1:10:12] just if I could pray, I was talking with
[1:10:14] Daniel yesterday and I was in my den and
[1:10:18] I was just I was just kind of emotional
[1:10:20] just reading these scriptures.
[1:10:23] And I told Daniel, I said, "Buddy," I
[1:10:25] said, 'You know, I pray for you that the
[1:10:27] Lord will give you a good wife like I
[1:10:30] have, that the Lord will give you joy in
[1:10:33] your life. I pray for you that the Lord
[1:10:35] will give you a good career, that the
[1:10:38] Lord will always give you this
[1:10:42] fellowship with him and that that that
[1:10:45] that you really prosper in everything.
[1:10:47] But then I told Daniel, I said, "But
[1:10:51] buddy,
[1:10:52] if I could just pray for one thing in
[1:10:58] your life," and I had my Bible open
[1:11:01] there. I said, "Listen to this." And I
[1:11:04] read Ephesians
[1:11:07] chapter 3
[1:11:10] and listen to this.
[1:11:14] Skipping all my notes.
[1:11:19] Listen to this. Ephesians chapter 3.
[1:11:23] Let's go back, brothers. If you go back
[1:11:24] to verse 14, I'm sorry
[1:11:27] I gave him 16, but let's go back a
[1:11:29] little bit.
[1:11:32] The Apostle Paul. This is the one I was
[1:11:33] just talking about.
[1:11:35] This is the one that got struck down on
[1:11:37] the road to Damascus. This is the one
[1:11:39] that was persecuting the people. This is
[1:11:41] the one that was fasting for three days.
[1:11:44] This is the one that God sent this man,
[1:11:47] Ananas, to to pray for him, to lay his
[1:11:50] hands on him, that the scales might come
[1:11:52] off of his eyes, that he might receive
[1:11:53] the Holy Spirit, that he might be
[1:11:55] baptized. This is the one that that
[1:11:57] happened to years ago. This is the one
[1:11:59] that is praying this for the Ephesian
[1:12:02] church. Now, he is the Apostle Paul.
[1:12:07] He has he has had an experience. Now, he
[1:12:12] is the main person. He is setting the
[1:12:15] stage for Christianity until this day
[1:12:18] that we live in. He wrote most of the
[1:12:20] New Testament. He set the doctrines
[1:12:22] forth. This is why we believe that Jesus
[1:12:25] Christ is God is because of this man
[1:12:28] Paul.
[1:12:30] He was a great man. And listen to his
[1:12:33] prayer for the Ephesian church.
[1:12:36] For this cause I bow my knees unto the
[1:12:39] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[1:12:41] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:12:43] named.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Now listen to what Paul is asking.
[1:12:48] Paul had met Jesus Christ. Paul had
[1:12:50] spoke to him. He had identified himself
[1:12:53] as God to Paul. Paul has this great
[1:12:55] experience that he would grant you
[1:12:59] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:13:02] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:13:05] in the inner man
[1:13:07] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:13:09] faith
[1:13:11] that you being rooted and grounded in
[1:13:13] love.
[1:13:15] I talk about love all the time.
[1:13:18] Paul is saying that you need to be
[1:13:19] rooted and grounded not in your
[1:13:22] doctrines.
[1:13:24] You need to be rooted and grounded not
[1:13:25] in anything else. He says you need to be
[1:13:27] rooted and grounded in love.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; That's what God is.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Not even in our understanding.
[1:13:36] We are not rooted and grounded in our
[1:13:39] understanding.
[1:13:40] We are rooted and grounded. Paul is
[1:13:42] praying that we would be rooted and
[1:13:45] grounded in love.
[1:13:50] I'll read it again. That Christ may
[1:13:52] dwell in your hearts by faith. That you
[1:13:55] being rooted and grounded in love may be
[1:13:58] able to comprehend with all saints what
[1:14:02] is the breadth and the length and depth
[1:14:05] and height.
[1:14:08] I can't explain these things in a
[1:14:10] sermon.
[1:14:11] We can't explain these things to our
[1:14:13] children. I can't tie the scriptures
[1:14:15] together and give an understanding of
[1:14:17] these things.
[1:14:19] This is beyond healing. This is beyond
[1:14:21] deliverance. This is beyond anything
[1:14:23] that we could ever ask for. He's saying
[1:14:26] that we would understand
[1:14:29] God. That we would fully understand what
[1:14:31] it is to love him. That we would fully
[1:14:34] understand what it is to have hope in
[1:14:36] Jesus Christ. That we would fully
[1:14:38] understand what it is for him to love
[1:14:40] us.
[1:14:42] And this is what the apostle is praying.
[1:14:48] This is what I was telling Daniel
[1:14:50] yesterday. Buddy,
[1:14:52] if I could have anything for my son, my
[1:14:54] beloved son, if I could have anything
[1:14:57] for my daughter, if I could have
[1:14:59] anything for the ones for you all that I
[1:15:01] love so dearly, of course I want your
[1:15:04] healing. Of course I want your
[1:15:05] happiness. Of course I want the young
[1:15:07] people to meet a good spouse. Of course
[1:15:10] I want those things. And those things
[1:15:11] are very important. But if I could have
[1:15:13] anything in the world for my loved ones,
[1:15:15] it would be what Paul is praying. If you
[1:15:17] could just know the love of Jesus
[1:15:20] Christ. If you could just get it
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; now unto him that is able. No, I'm
[1:15:26] sorry. Verse number 19.
[1:15:29] and to know the love of Christ
[1:15:34] which passes knowledge that you might be
[1:15:37] filled with all the fullness of God.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; The love of Christ passes all knowledge.
[1:15:45] And Paul is saying if you could just
[1:15:48] know this love is beyond everything.
[1:15:52] It's beyond anything that we could ever
[1:15:54] ask for.
[1:15:56] It says, let's go back to and let's read
[1:15:59] it again. Verse verse number 14,
[1:16:00] brothers, if you go back there, I just
[1:16:02] want it to stick. I want you to leave
[1:16:04] church this morning thinking of this
[1:16:07] prayer that Paul prayed.
[1:16:10] And if you could pray this prayer for
[1:16:11] anyone that you truly love. Of course,
[1:16:14] we ask
[1:16:16] for what our immediate needs are, but
[1:16:19] this is this prayer is just it's
[1:16:21] everything. It's if we could just
[1:16:23] understand him. For this cause I bow my
[1:16:26] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:16:28] Christ, of whom the whole family in
[1:16:30] heaven and earth is named,
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; that he would grant you according to the
[1:16:37] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:16:39] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:16:43] man.
[1:16:45] he could come inside
[1:16:47] of us
[1:16:49] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:16:51] faith
[1:16:53] that you being rooted and grounded in
[1:16:55] love may be able to comprehend with all
[1:17:00] the saints. So it's he's saying that
[1:17:02] Paul's saying that I want everybody to
[1:17:04] have this. Not just you Ephesians, not
[1:17:07] just you Tucson tabernacle, not just my
[1:17:09] son, not just my wife, not just my
[1:17:11] daughter, but he Paul is saying I want
[1:17:13] all of everyone to have this. all of the
[1:17:15] the saints. I want everyone to have this
[1:17:17] understanding
[1:17:23] that that he would grant you that you
[1:17:25] may be able to comprehend with all
[1:17:26] saints what is the breadth
[1:17:29] and the length and the depth and the
[1:17:31] height
[1:17:32] and to know the love of Christ
[1:17:37] which passes knowledge
[1:17:39] that you might be filled with all
[1:17:41] fullness of God.
[1:17:43] Now unto him that is able to do
[1:17:45] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:17:48] ask or think according to the power that
[1:17:50] works in us. Unto him be glory in the
[1:17:54] church by Christ Jesus
[1:17:57] throughout all ages
[1:17:59] world
[1:18:01] without end. Amen. Let me read that
[1:18:04] again again. Unto him be glory in the
[1:18:07] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[1:18:09] ages, world without end.
[1:18:13] Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Friends, this Apostle Paul who was an
[1:18:17] important man
[1:18:20] and he knew because he had that
[1:18:23] experience with God and even he as I've
[1:18:25] read before even he said I haven't
[1:18:28] attained it yet. In another place he
[1:18:30] said I die I die daily.
[1:18:33] I want more. I want more.
[1:18:36] I got I got to have more Lord. I I want
[1:18:38] to and here's Paul and he's telling
[1:18:40] everybody about it. And then Paul, he
[1:18:42] lets us see a little bit of himself and
[1:18:44] he's like, "You know what? I don't have
[1:18:45] it yet,
[1:18:47] but I want more." And then when he gets
[1:18:49] it
[1:18:51] and he's rejoices, the next day he's
[1:18:54] like, "I don't have it yet. I want
[1:18:57] more."
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; And then the Lord gives it to him. And
[1:19:00] then the next day he's like, "You know
[1:19:01] what? I don't have it yet. I want to
[1:19:03] keep going. I want to keep going. I want
[1:19:05] to keep getting closer to God." And then
[1:19:07] if you would just understand, and he's
[1:19:08] saying all my little children, he's
[1:19:10] saying all of my friends and all of
[1:19:12] everybody, if you could just understand
[1:19:15] the love of God, if you could just
[1:19:16] understand how big it is, the dimensions
[1:19:20] of this this love of God,
[1:19:23] then
[1:19:25] believe God's work would be completed in
[1:19:27] your life.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And that's with us, friends.
[1:19:32] That's what prayer is.
[1:19:34] Prayer is that communion and the
[1:19:36] musicians can come in closing. Prayer is
[1:19:39] that communion with God and how much we
[1:19:44] love him. And if we could just
[1:19:47] understand the meaning of his love for
[1:19:50] us, all of the prayers, all of our
[1:19:53] little needs that we have, they're all
[1:19:55] tiny. I've given my testimony before. I
[1:19:58] was just struggling in life a few years
[1:20:02] ago. And I went up in the mountains and
[1:20:07] I had all of these things going in my
[1:20:09] mind about all of these religious
[1:20:11] differences and all of these questions
[1:20:12] that I had going on and and I just I was
[1:20:15] like, Lord, I just need your help. I
[1:20:17] need to know what you want me to do.
[1:20:18] Where do you want me? What what what can
[1:20:20] I do? Where do you want my children?
[1:20:22] How, Lord? I just I need some help. And
[1:20:24] I looked up in the sky and I see all of
[1:20:26] these stars.
[1:20:29] There's no moon.
[1:20:32] The the the night was perfectly clear.
[1:20:37] And I looked up there and I saw the
[1:20:39] Milky Way and I saw all the different
[1:20:42] there's reds and blues and I looked at
[1:20:44] it like, "Oh god." And I felt really
[1:20:47] small. I felt such a a tiny worthless
[1:20:52] person. And I looked and the stars, it
[1:20:54] wasn't just right there. It went all the
[1:20:56] way to the ground.
[1:21:00] It's like, "Oh, God." Who am I?
[1:21:04] I said, "Every one of those
[1:21:06] is probably bigger than the rock I'm
[1:21:08] standing on right now, and I have a
[1:21:10] worry.
[1:21:13] And I worry about things, and you
[1:21:14] created every one of them."
[1:21:18] If I could just know, friends, if we
[1:21:20] could just know God, if we could just
[1:21:23] realize how much he loves us, if we
[1:21:27] could just realize how important we are
[1:21:29] to him,
[1:21:31] if we could just realize that, then the
[1:21:33] prayers will be answered. Yes. But
[1:21:35] that's not the important thing. when we
[1:21:37] pray for one another. Lord, give this
[1:21:40] person, give brother Jonathan the
[1:21:42] understanding of how much God loves him
[1:21:45] and how great God is.
[1:21:47] Lord, give each one, as Paul prayed, he
[1:21:50] says, not just for you, but for all of
[1:21:52] the saints that you would just
[1:21:54] understand
[1:21:56] this love of God.
[1:21:59] If we could just
[1:22:01] do what Paul said,
[1:22:04] if we could just pray that way, pray
[1:22:07] that way as a church.
[1:22:09] And if you have a need, ask him. He'll
[1:22:12] give it. But the main thing,
[1:22:17] pray that this person would know God.
[1:22:21] And then then you don't have to worry.
[1:22:25] You can pray directly
[1:22:27] to God. And then that prayer is not
[1:22:30] dependent on your pastor or priest or
[1:22:33] mom or dad or anyone else. That prayer
[1:22:37] is between you and the almighty. And you
[1:22:40] say, "Lord, I know you love me. I know
[1:22:42] you're hearing.
[1:22:44] And you may you may bring somebody else
[1:22:47] to me. You may let it fall out of the
[1:22:49] sky. Whatever it is, Lord, I know that
[1:22:52] you're hearing me. I have put up my
[1:22:55] prayer as this incense came up before
[1:22:58] you. I got to read it in closing. I'm
[1:23:02] over time, but let me just read this.
[1:23:04] Let's all stand.
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:13] Oh, beautiful. Listen to the to the one
[1:23:18] that we are praying to.
[1:23:21] Revelation
[1:23:24] chapter 5
[1:23:27] verse 8.
[1:23:31] Now when he had taken the scroll,
[1:23:34] the book,
[1:23:36] the four beasts,
[1:23:38] the four living creatures, I'll read the
[1:23:40] New King James version. We're similar.
[1:23:43] And the 20 and four elders fell down
[1:23:46] before the land.
[1:23:48] These are the most powerful people.
[1:23:50] These 24 elders and these four beasts,
[1:23:52] these four living creatures, these are
[1:23:55] ones with great authority and with great
[1:23:57] power. And they fell down before the
[1:24:00] Lamb. The same one that we pray to, the
[1:24:02] same one that loves us. They fell down
[1:24:05] before the Lamb, each having a harp
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:10] and golden vials, golden bowls, as I
[1:24:13] mentioned earlier, full
[1:24:17] of odors, full of incense.
[1:24:21] which are the prayers of the saints.
[1:24:24] And they sang a new song, said, "You are
[1:24:27] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:24:29] seals. For you were slain and have
[1:24:31] redeemed us to God by your blood, out of
[1:24:33] every tribe and tongue and people and
[1:24:35] nation, and have made us kings and
[1:24:38] priests to our God, and we shall reign
[1:24:42] on earth." Then I looked and I heard the
[1:24:44] voice of many angels round about the
[1:24:46] throne, the living creatures and the
[1:24:48] elders. And the number of them was
[1:24:49] 10,000
[1:24:51] times 10,000 and thousands and
[1:24:53] thousands. Like we talked about the
[1:24:55] other night,
[1:24:57] a hundred
[1:24:59] million angels
[1:25:03] circling around the throne
[1:25:07] and they're all singing,
[1:25:10] "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
[1:25:13] receive power
[1:25:15] and riches and wisdom and strength and
[1:25:17] honor and glory and blessings
[1:25:21] in every creature.
[1:25:24] which is in heaven,
[1:25:28] and on the earth, and under the earth,
[1:25:29] and such as are in the in the sea, and
[1:25:32] all that are in them, I heard saying,
[1:25:35] "Blessing, and honor, and glory, and
[1:25:38] power be unto him that siteth upon the
[1:25:40] throne, and unto the Lamb forever and
[1:25:45] ever."
[1:25:47] Then the four
[1:25:49] living creatures said, "Amen."
[1:25:53] And the 20 and four elders fell down and
[1:25:57] worshiped him who lives forever and
[1:26:01] ever. And they even took off their
[1:26:02] crowns and they even cast him at his
[1:26:06] feet. And this is the one that we are
[1:26:08] praying to. This is the one that Paul
[1:26:11] said, "I just wish that you had a
[1:26:12] relationship with him. I just wish that
[1:26:14] you knew how big his love is
[1:26:18] for you.
[1:26:21] I could go on and on, friends.
[1:26:24] Let's sing. Brother Josiah,

[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Is he awesome?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; He's great. He's wonderful. He is so
[1:31:44] good.
[1:31:49] Can you imagine
[1:31:51] if we could just know the height and the
[1:31:53] depth and the the breadth and and
[1:31:56] everything about his love? Can you
[1:31:58] imagine if we could just know that?
[1:32:01] How great would our faith be?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; How just Lord, I have a need. I know you
[1:32:08] know me. I know you love me. I have a
[1:32:11] need. Here's my need. Lord, my sister,
[1:32:15] she has a need.
[1:32:17] I know you love her. Here's her need,
[1:32:19] Lord. I place it into your hands in the
[1:32:22] name of your son, Jesus Christ. Can you
[1:32:25] imagine that faith, that love? If we
[1:32:29] could just understand that love of as
[1:32:31] Paul prayed, then our faith would grow
[1:32:35] and it would just bubble over. Let's bow
[1:32:39] our heads.
[1:32:45] Before the throne, there was a sea of
[1:32:48] glass like crystal. And in the midst of
[1:32:50] the throne and round about the throne
[1:32:52] were four living creatures full of eyes
[1:32:54] in the front and the back. The first
[1:32:55] living creature was like a lion, and the
[1:32:57] second was like a calf. The third had
[1:33:00] the face like a man, and the fourth was
[1:33:03] like a flying eagle. And the four
[1:33:06] creatures, each having six wings, were
[1:33:09] full of eyes around around and within.
[1:33:12] And they do not rest day or night,
[1:33:18] saying, "Holy, holy, holy,
[1:33:22] Lord God Almighty,
[1:33:24] who was and is and is to come." Whenever
[1:33:28] the living creatures give glory and
[1:33:30] honor and thanks to him who sits on the
[1:33:32] throne, who lives forever and ever, the
[1:33:36] 24 elders fall down before him who sits
[1:33:38] on the throne. And they worship him who
[1:33:41] lives forever and ever. And they cast
[1:33:43] their crowns before the throne, saying,
[1:33:45] "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive
[1:33:48] glory and honor and power, for you
[1:33:50] created all things, and by your will
[1:33:54] they exist and were created.
[1:33:57] Lord God,
[1:34:02] Lord, just to think
[1:34:05] all that is around your throne right now
[1:34:07] and these these great beings, Lord, that
[1:34:10] we might not understand, but they are
[1:34:12] worshiping you. And Lord, to think that
[1:34:16] we are sons and daughters,
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:20] Lord, to think that you love us
[1:34:23] and to think that you care, Father.
[1:34:27] with all of that's going on in heaven
[1:34:29] right now
[1:34:31] and to think that you care.
[1:34:34] You care about me.
[1:34:37] You care about every person in this
[1:34:39] room.
[1:34:42] Lord, you love us
[1:34:45] and you spoke
[1:34:47] through your apostle
[1:34:49] and he prayed that we might understand
[1:34:53] your love. Lord, give us more
[1:34:55] understanding.
[1:34:57] Give us more revelation of you. Father,
[1:34:59] we pray.
[1:35:03] Lord, help us through the day.
[1:35:06] Help us through this life. Father,
[1:35:10] may your blessings, Lord, rest upon
[1:35:13] those that are in this room and upon
[1:35:15] those that are streaming in to this
[1:35:17] service.
[1:35:19] May the love of Jesus Christ become more
[1:35:21] real. Lord, we pray.
[1:35:24] in Jesus name. Amen.

[1:35:31] revelation song.

[1:39:59] Ah, he's worth our adoration.
[1:40:03] Oh,
[1:40:08] and just think the one that we are
[1:40:10] praying to is the one that really loves
[1:40:13] us.
[1:40:15] And Paul was praying, I just wish you
[1:40:17] could understand his love.
[1:40:20] So friends, let's continue on in prayer.
[1:40:23] Tonight, come ready to worship. Tonight
[1:40:27] at 5:00, we're going to have uh we're
[1:40:30] going to have some song specials. And uh
[1:40:33] before we get before we get started
[1:40:35] tonight,
[1:40:37] I will answer asked the church to bring
[1:40:39] some questions in.
[1:40:41] And we've had some very good questions.
[1:40:43] One question I think is pertinent to our
[1:40:45] church and I think it's a very very
[1:40:48] important question that we understand
[1:40:53] and I will be answering that question
[1:40:56] tonight. It's when Jesus says I came to
[1:41:00] divide.
[1:41:01] I came to separate.
[1:41:04] What does that mean? Well, I always talk
[1:41:06] about unity. I always talk about love.
[1:41:09] But then he said, "And yet I come to
[1:41:12] divide And I think it would be very very
[1:41:14] good for us all to hear. I'll just take
[1:41:17] about 10 minutes or so on that question
[1:41:19] and then we'll just sing and we'll
[1:41:21] worship and we'll just have a good time.
[1:41:23] So come tonight. It'll be a good
[1:41:25] service. God bless you brothers and
[1:41:27] sisters. As we leave, please I I know
[1:41:30] that we're going to be praying. There's
[1:41:32] going to be a lot of people praying. So
[1:41:33] as you leave, pre please exit the
[1:41:35] sanctuary quietly in respect of those
[1:41:38] that who would like to stay and pray.
[1:41:41] And then I hope to see you out in the
[1:41:43] fellowship hall, brother Phillip. So
[1:41:45] good to see you, bro. I hope to hope to
[1:41:47] see you out there. It's good to see all
