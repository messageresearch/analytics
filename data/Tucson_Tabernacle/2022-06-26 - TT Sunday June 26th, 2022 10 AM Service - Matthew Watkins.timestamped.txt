[36:23] family
[36:25] with us today and brother matt will be
[36:28] ministering this morning and this this
[36:29] evening lord willing so
[36:32] brother matt sent forwarded to to us and
[36:34] i didn't get a chance to ask him where
[36:36] he got it but
[36:38] there's a recording of brother green in
[36:39] 1968
[36:42] speaking at the full gospels
[36:43] businessman's up up in phoenix
[36:46] and i'd maybe maybe this wednesday we
[36:48] could play it's about a
[36:50] 20-minute clip
[36:52] of
[36:53] of the excitement in his voice i i heard
[36:55] brother green again
[36:57] how especially when he's a younger man
[36:59] the excitement of getting know what god
[37:01] has done for us in this day and age
[37:04] but even more than that a god being real
[37:06] and personal to each individual
[37:09] rather than well he was good for brother
[37:11] brandon was good but no but he's good
[37:12] for me too
[37:14] so possibly maybe on wednesday night we
[37:16] could play that little portion of it it
[37:18] was just
[37:19] encouraging to see that jesus christ is
[37:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[37:23] amen but sometimes you know we get to
[37:26] thinking why why lord why this
[37:29] how come
[37:30] and i opened the the song book and fell
[37:32] on farther along
[37:34] will understand we'll understand why
[37:36] we'll know maybe on that side looking
[37:38] back and saying that's why that's why
[37:41] you had this in mind god bless
[37:43] farther along
[37:47] tempted
[37:50] [Music]
[37:58] why it should be
[38:03] all the day long
[38:07] while there are
[38:12] living about
[38:15] [Music]
[38:26] farther
[38:28] along we'll know
[38:33] [Music]
[38:43] cheer up my
[38:46] [Music]
[38:57] i'm
[39:03] [Music]
[39:09] it leaves our homes
[39:13] [Music]
[39:26] living so
[39:34] farther along
[39:37] we'll know all about
[39:41] [Music]
[39:50] cheer up my brother
[39:55] [Music]
[40:07] faithful till death
[40:16] few more days
[40:21] [Music]
[40:32] as we sweep through
[40:34] the
[40:35] beautiful
[40:38] [Music]
[40:48] farther along
[40:50] [Music]
[41:04] will understand
[41:08] [Music]
[41:12] you know sometimes we do ask the lord
[41:14] why
[41:16] but he knows best
[41:18] he's already seen the end from the
[41:20] beginning he's seen you on the other
[41:22] side already rejoicing that i appreciate
[41:25] that so
[41:26] good to have each one of you here and
[41:28] brother matt sister rachel good to see
[41:30] you in the family
[41:32] with the man saying here rachel used to
[41:34] be duel good to see you all here god
[41:36] bless you
[41:38] lord's been good to us
[41:39] how many can say man lord's been good to
[41:41] us
[41:42] sometimes we don't understand some of
[41:44] the things we go through and why
[41:46] but therefore a purpose and a reason
[41:49] been working with steven now
[41:52] at work and it's been about a month now
[41:54] and
[41:56] trying to show him these are the things
[41:57] you're going to have to do down the road
[42:00] just didn't think we'd have to do them
[42:01] all in four weeks it's been quite busy
[42:04] but you know sometimes
[42:06] god god leads us along
[42:08] and and he takes us to a place where
[42:10] when that time and that trial that thing
[42:12] comes you're ready because you know god
[42:14] keeps you and he takes care of you so
[42:18] if we'll stand together and
[42:23] you know we we see the things that are
[42:25] happening and we we
[42:27] see what just
[42:29] supreme court did and
[42:31] what this country and even the whole
[42:33] world's reaction to what has happened
[42:36] but god said it would be that way

[51:13] hand amen praise the lord
[51:16] amen always just a privilege to come

[51:19] tabernacle i was but aaron was
[51:21] mentioning there what i shared someone
[51:23] shared with me
[51:24] uh brother green speaking there at the
[51:26] full gospel businessman you'll get a
[51:28] chance i think to hear that you said
[51:30] wednesday and it was just uh something i
[51:32] began to just
[51:34] meditate on that even on the way i was
[51:36] listening to it in the airplane flying
[51:38] here
[51:39] and i thought my goodness
[51:41] how
[51:42] privileged we are
[51:44] that there were men who came before us
[51:47] long before maybe some of you or some of
[51:50] you uh even the little ones here today
[51:52] weren't even live but there were
[51:53] faithful
[51:54] men of god who held this truth stood for
[51:58] this truth preached this truth defended
[52:01] this truth
[52:02] and now you're a product
[52:04] of their of of their labor and their
[52:07] efforts and what they went through were
[52:09] a product of grace
[52:11] amen i'm certainly thankful for that
[52:13] hearing meditating and pondering that
[52:15] just flying and i thought my all the
[52:18] voices uh that was labored brother green
[52:20] for years behind this pulpit and the men
[52:23] of god even after him the brothers who
[52:25] would come and he would have minister
[52:27] and then to thank even prior to that you
[52:29] know god's prophet amen and i just
[52:32] thought lord i'm just
[52:33] who am i
[52:35] as david said that you would be mindful
[52:37] of me
[52:38] amen what grace is this
[52:41] amen truly we're blessed amen to be
[52:44] called the sons and daughters of god
[52:46] amen it's a privilege to be here with
[52:48] you i hope i could just be myself amen
[52:50] and that'll help me to be comfortable
[52:52] and if i could be comfortable if you can
[52:54] make me feel comfortable then we ought
[52:56] to be able to say lord you ought to feel
[52:58] comfortable amongst us
[53:00] amen come how many could say that raise
[53:02] your hand say lord
[53:04] feel right at home right here not not
[53:06] just in this building right at my seat
[53:08] today would you come and feel
[53:10] comfortable to minister to me
[53:13] amen i know that he will he's always
[53:15] faithful brother ed good to see you

[53:24] wife my oldest son gideon amen good to
[53:26] have him here with us you love the lord

[53:36] good singing and music
[53:38] amen the worship
[53:40] romans chapter 7. i'd like to
[53:43] just have this uh burden upon my heart
[53:47] while i was uh even while i was flying
[53:49] here but aaron would you mind getting my
[53:52] cell phone in the back there i've i've
[53:54] tethered it to my computer to give me
[53:56] internet but they do have the powerpoint
[53:58] that's wonderful
[54:00] just on the way driving here or flying
[54:02] here um
[54:04] i was the lord just begin to impress
[54:06] this upon my heart
[54:08] and as i was just looking at some of
[54:09] these notes and uh the scripture in
[54:11] romans i was just excited i began to
[54:14] become thank you i was beginning just to
[54:16] become excited to be knowing that i
[54:18] would minister this here today and i
[54:20] don't have
[54:21] uh the top we we only have today this
[54:24] morning
[54:25] and uh and tonight to be able to
[54:27] minister this i actually took this
[54:29] thought and ministered it for a few
[54:31] parts
[54:32] and um and so
[54:34] we only have two services so we don't
[54:36] want to be here through we don't we
[54:37] don't have permission to just preach
[54:39] this morning and just keep going till
[54:40] the night do we bring here no
[54:42] everybody's thinking no he doesn't but
[54:43] here
[54:45] um but we just want to say what the lord
[54:47] has for us to say and then we'll stop
[54:49] and we'll pick it up
[54:50] tonight but i do have a lot upon my
[54:52] heart i'd just like to minister and
[54:55] minister this over a few parts and i'd
[54:57] just like to be able to look at this
[54:59] romans 7 and and if i could say it this
[55:02] way
[55:03] through just studying this and the way
[55:05] the lord just spoke to me
[55:07] throughout the sermon
[55:09] it helped me understand me
[55:12] a little bit better now the lord
[55:14] understands me he understands every part
[55:17] of you
[55:18] he knows the parts that no one else does
[55:20] that only you know
[55:22] and even the lord knows the things about
[55:24] us that maybe we don't even fully
[55:27] understand about ourself you were a
[55:30] complicated creature
[55:32] and especially uh a believer who's who's
[55:36] got a seed gene of god
[55:38] and down inside of them you're
[55:40] complicated and trying to understand
[55:42] yourself and sometimes we we struggle
[55:45] with that and think i don't understand i
[55:47] i've gotta i know that something down
[55:49] inside of me has a desire to be pleasing
[55:52] to the lord
[55:54] and here's what else i know i didn't put
[55:56] that down inside of me
[55:59] but yet i know there's another part of
[56:00] me that struggles and i still battle and
[56:03] i still war with things in it before i
[56:05] came to the lord i how many could
[56:07] witness and be a test to have a
[56:09] testimony here and say before i knew the
[56:11] lord i was just evil my thoughts were
[56:14] evil i i might have had good reason and
[56:16] good parents and a good home but there
[56:18] was a nature down inside of me that just
[56:21] struggled with the things of the flesh
[56:23] and temptations of the flesh and and i
[56:25] was constantly my mind was on evil and
[56:28] and then i met the lord and then the
[56:30] lord saved me and he sanctified me and
[56:33] i'm glad for that but even after that i
[56:36] still find that i still struggle even
[56:39] after i'm born of the spirit of god you
[56:41] could say i know that i've met the lord
[56:43] i know that he's changed something
[56:45] inside of me i know as the woman said
[56:48] brother branham rehearses and he says
[56:49] that she said i may not be who i want to
[56:52] be
[56:53] but i sure ain't who i used to be
[56:56] amen and and so we could say that here
[56:59] today but we could we could look
[57:00] inwardly and say but yet there's still
[57:03] something down on the inside of me that
[57:06] still struggles
[57:08] and i don't understand why if i love the
[57:10] lord and i've got his word i've got his
[57:13] life living inside of me there's still
[57:14] this inward struggle well if you ever
[57:17] felt that way the apostle paul could
[57:19] relate with you really well
[57:21] and we're going to look at it here in
[57:23] verse let's just begin reading here i
[57:26] want to find my place i don't want to
[57:27] read the entire
[57:29] passage here
[57:31] let's just begin reading at verse 14.
[57:32] that'd be a good place to start romans
[57:34] chapter 7 verse 14. i want you as you
[57:37] read this with me to understand it's
[57:39] almost this isn't how paul wrote the
[57:42] letter but
[57:43] as as we begin to read these verses
[57:45] you're going to find it i i've said it
[57:47] this way it's almost like i found a
[57:50] diary of paul and he's going to write it
[57:52] he wasn't expecting anybody to ever read
[57:55] it but he's just expressing his thoughts
[57:57] and he's trying to almost as he
[57:58] expresses that he's he's figuring it out
[58:01] but he doesn't let's just pick it up
[58:02] here at verse 14.
[58:04] for we know that the law
[58:06] is spiritual but i
[58:09] am carnal
[58:11] sold under sin
[58:13] for that which i do i allow not
[58:17] for what i would
[58:19] that do i not but what i hate that do i
[58:24] if then i do that which i would not
[58:26] i can send unto the law that it is good
[58:29] now then it is no more i that do it but
[58:33] sin
[58:34] that dwelleth in
[58:37] me
[58:38] are you following
[58:40] verse 18. now notice
[58:42] for i know that in
[58:45] me now i want you to focus and key it on
[58:48] this word me
[58:49] because paul is going to begin to divide
[58:52] me into three parts he's not it's not
[58:55] just the when he says me he's not just
[58:57] talking about paul or uh the apostle
[59:00] paul but he's beginning to dissect who
[59:03] he is now watch how he says this here he
[59:05] says in verse 18 for i know that is that
[59:08] in me parentheses that is
[59:11] in my
[59:12] flesh
[59:14] dwelleth no good thing how many could
[59:16] testify to that nothing good inside of
[59:18] my flesh
[59:20] for to will is present with me but how
[59:24] to perform
[59:26] that which is good i find
[59:29] not
[59:31] for the good that i would i do not but
[59:34] the evil which i would not or in other
[59:36] words what i don't want to do that i do
[59:39] now if i do verse 20 that i would not it
[59:42] is no more i that do it but sin
[59:44] that dwelleth in me i find then a law
[59:48] that when i would do good
[59:52] evil is present with
[59:55] me
[59:56] now notice verse 22 for i now this is
[59:59] another part of him he's speaking of not
[1:00:01] the part of the flesh that is a no good
[1:00:03] thing for i
[1:00:05] delight in the law of god after the
[1:00:08] inward man
[1:00:10] so you see what the apostle i know i
[1:00:12] have you standing but this is important
[1:00:13] just to lay this in right here you see
[1:00:15] how the apostle paul begins to divide so
[1:00:18] what does he begin to tell you there's
[1:00:20] more to you
[1:00:22] than what you see in the mirror
[1:00:26] there is more to you as a believer than
[1:00:29] what you see what you live with every
[1:00:31] single day there's another part of you
[1:00:34] in fact there's two people
[1:00:38] say brother mad am i schizophrenic i've
[1:00:40] got two personalities i'm two people
[1:00:42] well we're going to find out
[1:00:44] you as a believer born of the spirit of
[1:00:47] god
[1:00:48] people say well this was not to the this
[1:00:50] was not to the born again no it
[1:00:51] absolutely is the apostle paul is not
[1:00:53] just talking to a person who's born
[1:00:54] again he's talking about himself
[1:00:57] and so he says there's more to me i find
[1:01:00] that in my flesh
[1:01:02] there's no good thing and i the things
[1:01:04] that my inward man says i want to live
[1:01:06] like the lord but i don't find myself
[1:01:08] all the time doing that
[1:01:10] he says here i find that allah verse 21
[1:01:12] that when i would do good evils present
[1:01:13] with me for i delight in the law of god
[1:01:15] after the inward man but i see another
[1:01:18] law in my members
[1:01:21] warring there's an important word if you
[1:01:25] are not in a war between what you know
[1:01:28] to do right and what you actually do if
[1:01:30] that struggle is not there i would say
[1:01:32] you're in a dangerous spot
[1:01:35] be thankful there's a struggle down
[1:01:37] inside of you
[1:01:39] he says warn against the law of my mind
[1:01:41] and bring me into captivity to the law
[1:01:43] of sin which is in my
[1:01:45] members o
[1:01:47] wretched
[1:01:49] man
[1:01:50] that i am lord we thank you for this
[1:01:53] reading this passage that we've read we
[1:01:55] just stopped there lord because it has
[1:01:57] felt you felt your nearness we've
[1:02:00] invited you lord in this place
[1:02:02] lord you inhabit the praises of your
[1:02:04] people that's where you dwell it's not a
[1:02:07] building lord we're appreciative of this
[1:02:09] building this pulpit the stage the music
[1:02:12] the instruments the musicians the gifts
[1:02:14] the talents that you have in your family
[1:02:17] we're thankful there's a roof above us
[1:02:19] lord where we can come and gather but
[1:02:21] truly lord that's not your house that's
[1:02:23] just a building that one day will be
[1:02:25] destroyed but your house and your
[1:02:27] tabernacle is in these people who i'm
[1:02:29] speaking of here today so lord as you're
[1:02:32] building as your tabernacle we just
[1:02:34] raise our hands in unity and say lord
[1:02:37] flow through us holy spirit may your
[1:02:40] spirit flow through the innermost part
[1:02:42] of my being may you receive my worship
[1:02:44] as i enter in now in jesus christ's name
[1:02:48] and the church said
[1:02:49] you can be seated this morning
[1:02:51] so paul and i'm going to just take my
[1:02:54] time because i know we have the service
[1:02:55] here tonight and so i'm not going to be
[1:02:57] in too much of a hurry but i just want
[1:02:59] to i want to make sure that i get to
[1:03:01] what what the lord has for us
[1:03:04] but paul begins to break this down and
[1:03:06] you can see here he's speaking of a part
[1:03:09] of himself that he doesn't understand
[1:03:12] you know that he picks up in romans 8
[1:03:14] and he says there's thou there no
[1:03:16] condemnation to them that are in christ
[1:03:18] who walk not after the flesh but who
[1:03:20] live walk after the spirit so there's a
[1:03:23] part of you that's a true believer
[1:03:26] that's a true believer of the word of
[1:03:28] god but yet there's a part of you that
[1:03:31] lives here today that came to church
[1:03:33] this morning that struggles in your
[1:03:36] flesh with the things of sin how many
[1:03:38] can say amen there was a part maybe some
[1:03:41] of you had an argument with yourself
[1:03:43] that you didn't want to come to church
[1:03:45] today i don't feel like waking up today
[1:03:46] i don't feel like going to the house of
[1:03:48] god maybe and the devil will give you
[1:03:50] every kind of reason and every kind of
[1:03:52] excuse
[1:03:54] why you should stay home but there's a
[1:03:56] spirit down inside of you that said uh
[1:03:58] uh you i'm not gonna listen to this
[1:04:00] flesh i'm gonna obey and bring my body
[1:04:03] subject to the nature that god has
[1:04:05] changed me with and i'm going to church
[1:04:07] this morning why because there's a part
[1:04:10] of me that needs it
[1:04:13] so paul begins to break this down and he
[1:04:15] comes to the very end and 24 he says oh
[1:04:17] wretched man that i am who shall deliver
[1:04:19] me i thank god through christ jesus
[1:04:22] that he says so i thank god through
[1:04:24] jesus christ our lord
[1:04:26] so you could say brother matt maybe that
[1:04:28] would be a it would be hard to
[1:04:30] understand romans 7. well maybe it would
[1:04:33] be for us and i'm so glad that we have a
[1:04:36] a word prophet who we don't have to
[1:04:39] guess or wonder or ask what did romans 7
[1:04:42] mean but we actually have an answer
[1:04:44] let's look at this here in romans 7. now
[1:04:46] this what you see is in bold because
[1:04:48] this was the person's question they
[1:04:51] quoted romans 7 14-18 the passage we
[1:04:54] just read and then they asked at the
[1:04:56] very end they say quote it here if
[1:04:58] you'll pick up here uh right here he
[1:05:00] says now then it is no more i that doeth
[1:05:02] it but sin that dwell offend me so they
[1:05:04] quote here's their question to god's
[1:05:06] prophet romans 7 there's a part of me
[1:05:08] that wants to do good but i don't find
[1:05:11] myself doing it there's a nature down on
[1:05:14] the inward man oh wretched man that i am
[1:05:17] they said let me brother branham says
[1:05:18] let me just kind of polish it up
[1:05:20] so the person asked this question and
[1:05:22] says this i don't understand brother
[1:05:24] branham can you explain it to me
[1:05:27] he said
[1:05:28] in me
[1:05:29] is
[1:05:30] two
[1:05:32] persons aha
[1:05:34] in me a believer born of the spirit of
[1:05:38] god is
[1:05:39] two people
[1:05:42] it means two persons right one wants me
[1:05:45] to do wrong the other wants me to do
[1:05:48] right and every time i start to do right
[1:05:51] then the wrong
[1:05:53] hinders me
[1:05:56] how many feel
[1:05:57] they could say i've been hindered many
[1:05:59] times to do what i know is right
[1:06:02] notice how many of you people in the
[1:06:03] interviews isn't incredible he says this
[1:06:05] how many of you people in the interviews
[1:06:08] uh this morning let me pick it up here
[1:06:10] he says how many of you in the
[1:06:12] interviews this afternoon has run that
[1:06:15] same thing
[1:06:17] and this morning so it's incredible
[1:06:19] people were coming to brother branham
[1:06:20] private interview and saying this is my
[1:06:22] struggle brother branham i don't i find
[1:06:25] that i'm a believer i know i'm born of
[1:06:27] the spirit of god i know i've received
[1:06:28] the baptism of the holy ghost but yet i
[1:06:30] still find a carnal nature down inside
[1:06:33] of me brother branham says you asked it
[1:06:34] even in the interviews because there's
[1:06:37] two people living down inside of you
[1:06:40] now watch out brother branham says this
[1:06:42] we are carnal
[1:06:43] and that part must perish but then
[1:06:47] inside we are a spiritual man soul
[1:06:50] inside and that's faith in god's word
[1:06:53] then
[1:06:54] we bring our outside body under
[1:06:57] subjection to the word by
[1:07:00] faith
[1:07:02] by accepting what god said
[1:07:05] how can i take a cocklebur and make a
[1:07:07] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[1:07:10] for me to do it the only way it can be
[1:07:12] is because inside that cockle burrow has
[1:07:15] been transmitted from a cocklebur wheat
[1:07:18] a cocklebur to a germ called wheat life
[1:07:22] then you bury that cocklebur and it'll
[1:07:25] produce a grain of wheat that's right
[1:07:27] see
[1:07:29] because there has been a life
[1:07:31] of wheat put in the cuckleberry and the
[1:07:34] life of the cocklebur has been taken out
[1:07:37] but the nature notice but the nature of
[1:07:40] the cocklebur is still
[1:07:43] sticky
[1:07:45] what is that crocodile right here
[1:07:48] you've taken remember brother madam in
[1:07:49] future home when he draws it out on the
[1:07:51] board and he draws the heart and he
[1:07:52] draws the snake that's living that first
[1:07:55] carnal sinful nature that you were born
[1:07:58] with you didn't ask for it i didn't ask
[1:08:00] for it but you were born with it
[1:08:02] i was trying to explain this to a good
[1:08:04] family member of mine who hadn't seen in
[1:08:06] many years and parted ways was best
[1:08:08] friends with him as a little as a boy
[1:08:10] until 10 11 years old and our lives went
[1:08:12] two directions my family moved he moved
[1:08:15] uh we moved away and hadn't heard from
[1:08:16] didn't even know if he was still alive
[1:08:18] as a cousin of mine and he then you know
[1:08:20] this many years later just a week or a
[1:08:22] week ago after 20 you know 30 years
[1:08:26] of not seeing him i get an email from
[1:08:29] our church saying uh you can you please
[1:08:31] have matthew reach out to me we were
[1:08:33] good friends i'm his cousin and i began
[1:08:35] to speak to him and he's he's he's
[1:08:38] telling me i'm catching up with him
[1:08:40] about his life and asking him you know
[1:08:42] we're just catching up haven't talked to
[1:08:43] him in so many years telling him about
[1:08:45] my family he's telling me about his and
[1:08:46] then he just begins to break down and he
[1:08:48] begins to weep and he says i don't know
[1:08:50] what's wrong with me um and i knew he
[1:08:53] wasn't serving the lord i knew he had
[1:08:54] not went to church his family
[1:08:56] had sort of drifted away from the house
[1:08:58] of god he was born in the message raised
[1:09:00] in a good church and he begins to just
[1:09:02] cry and he talks about how that he's uh
[1:09:04] he's beginning to tell me how he's a
[1:09:06] very uh renowned executive and of great
[1:09:09] big business he's making a six-figure
[1:09:11] income he's got the nicest things in
[1:09:13] life and he's got the nicest cars and
[1:09:15] he's got boats and atvs and just really
[1:09:19] he's telling me how made he's got it but
[1:09:21] yet he says i'm so broke on the inside
[1:09:24] and he said because i've got it i've got
[1:09:26] something i can't conquer and it was
[1:09:27] alcohol uh uh he had became an alcoholic
[1:09:31] and he was just beginning to confide in
[1:09:33] me hadn't told anybody said no no one
[1:09:35] even in his family except for his
[1:09:37] immediate family but he begins to
[1:09:39] confide in me and tell me how broken he
[1:09:41] is and what can he do he can't conquer
[1:09:43] this and he's tried over and over and he
[1:09:45] says i'm disciplined in every way of my
[1:09:47] life i i wake up every morning at five i
[1:09:50] exercise i have an exercise routine i'm
[1:09:53] healthy i eat healthy my body's in good
[1:09:55] shape i'm making good money i have a
[1:09:57] good life i'm i'm a good person he says
[1:09:59] but yet there's i can't conquer this
[1:10:01] it's got a hold of me and i'm like a
[1:10:03] slave that's what he told me i'm like a
[1:10:05] slave and it's my master and no matter
[1:10:08] how what i've tried of i've tried
[1:10:10] everything i've tried
[1:10:11] alcoholics anonymous i've tried uh
[1:10:13] self-help i've went to counselors and he
[1:10:15] says no matter what i've tried he said
[1:10:17] and he began to just he couldn't even
[1:10:18] speak he was crying he said i'm i'm so
[1:10:21] broke and he said it's going to destroy
[1:10:22] me i'm going to take someone's life he
[1:10:24] said in a car accident it's going to
[1:10:26] cost me my marriage it's going to cost
[1:10:28] me my my my career and he says i need i
[1:10:31] need freedom from this and i don't
[1:10:33] understand why i can't overcome this
[1:10:39] and i just began to deal with him i said
[1:10:40] what you've got to understand is that i
[1:10:43] don't care how polished up you've made
[1:10:44] your outside i don't care how
[1:10:46] disciplined and what grit iron will you
[1:10:48] have to live a good life and how
[1:10:50] determined and militant you are there's
[1:10:53] always a part of you that you were born
[1:10:55] with that is your master and you are its
[1:10:57] slave
[1:11:00] and until you're set free from the
[1:11:02] dominion of sin you could try all your
[1:11:04] self-help you can try all your iron will
[1:11:06] you could try your grit and your human
[1:11:08] ability but you'll come back to the same
[1:11:11] exact place you are born with the carnal
[1:11:13] nature and that nature is enmity with
[1:11:16] the things of god and it will always
[1:11:18] have a hold of you until you surrender
[1:11:20] your life to christ
[1:11:22] until you come and let the lord take out
[1:11:25] that cocklebur life and replace it with
[1:11:28] a wheat life oh i'm so glad i can say
[1:11:31] today that satan is no longer on the
[1:11:33] throne of my heart but jesus reigns
[1:11:36] supreme and i may not always do right i
[1:11:39] may not always make the right choices i
[1:11:41] may still make mistakes but in my heart
[1:11:44] i know i've got a desire to live for the
[1:11:46] lord jesus
[1:11:48] that's because of something he did not
[1:11:50] because of something i did
[1:11:53] brother madam says because there's a
[1:11:54] conqueror in the life of that congregate
[1:11:56] has been taken out but notice the nature
[1:11:58] of the cuckleburg is still sticky
[1:12:02] and it will be until i'm born again
[1:12:06] until i come to the altar and i get
[1:12:07] prayed over enough times
[1:12:10] until brother branham says and it will
[1:12:12] be until this new life
[1:12:15] has fully been
[1:12:18] developed
[1:12:19] say brother matt when will this new life
[1:12:22] fully be developed when you turn 18 for
[1:12:25] the second time
[1:12:30] now a believer will know exactly what
[1:12:31] i'm talking about you might have turned
[1:12:33] 18 you may not be 18 yet young people
[1:12:35] but let me tell you you'll be 18 one day
[1:12:38] and you'll be 18 a second time around 18
[1:12:40] 19 years old when that new body that's
[1:12:43] when the new life has been fully
[1:12:45] developed
[1:12:48] until then you're in a war
[1:12:52] he says it's still sticking until this
[1:12:53] new life has been fully developed out of
[1:12:55] the ground and raised up again when it
[1:12:57] comes forth notice then it's no more
[1:13:00] cockapoo but wheat but wheat but while
[1:13:02] it's here on earth
[1:13:05] out of the earth at a cockleboro it's
[1:13:08] still
[1:13:09] sticky but it's got in the nature on the
[1:13:12] inside of it of wheat
[1:13:14] now this is how brother branham answers
[1:13:16] romans 7
[1:13:18] as long as you're in this life how many
[1:13:22] still in this life
[1:13:25] i know some people live up in the
[1:13:27] ethereal and they're so high up here and
[1:13:28] they lose reality that you're still down
[1:13:30] here with us
[1:13:33] as long as you're in this life you're
[1:13:36] going to be sticky
[1:13:38] and have a carnal
[1:13:40] nature
[1:13:42] you know we're sticky that's how we are
[1:13:44] we're sticky nature back home where
[1:13:45] there's a lot of humidity and you get
[1:13:47] real sticky maybe here you get real
[1:13:48] prickly like the cactus
[1:13:50] there's always you don't get too close
[1:13:52] there's a nature of thorns and you know
[1:13:54] what it'll always be there
[1:13:58] can you say amen
[1:14:00] so brother madam says this he says
[1:14:02] that's going to notice and have a carnal
[1:14:05] nature that's going to bother you as
[1:14:09] as long as you live
[1:14:12] but the inside of you you're born again
[1:14:15] and when you're raised up in other words
[1:14:17] in the resurrection when you're raised
[1:14:19] up you're in the likeness of christ
[1:14:20] that's why paul said we don't know what
[1:14:22] we will be when he appears but we know
[1:14:24] this we shall be like him in his very
[1:14:28] image you say hal brother matt will i be
[1:14:30] like him because i'm being changed from
[1:14:32] glory unto glory from line upon line
[1:14:35] precept upon precept and one day this
[1:14:38] body will change as my soul has changed
[1:14:42] how am i going to get there brother matt
[1:14:44] how am i going to receive a change of my
[1:14:46] body do you realize that the same
[1:14:49] supernatural power that changed you to a
[1:14:52] christian and to desire the word of god
[1:14:54] do you know that no amount of effort no
[1:14:57] amount of knowledge no amount of
[1:14:59] education can ever put that desire down
[1:15:01] inside of your heart but a supernatural
[1:15:03] power has put something inside of you to
[1:15:05] thirst for the things of god and to
[1:15:07] hunger for the things of god
[1:15:10] that's supernatural and the same power
[1:15:12] that transforms your inside is also
[1:15:15] what's going to come upon you as
[1:15:16] quickening power and change the outside
[1:15:21] so brother branham says here you're born
[1:15:23] again and when you're raised up you're
[1:15:25] in the likeness of christ all sin is
[1:15:26] going from you that's the thing now
[1:15:28] notice this he says somebody told me now
[1:15:31] now brother brandon begins to tell this
[1:15:33] story and he tells about the old indian
[1:15:35] chief and you remember the story really
[1:15:36] well and the man comes to the prayer
[1:15:38] line and billy's only giving out prayer
[1:15:39] he's he's trying to ask everybody
[1:15:41] because they only wanted to take enough
[1:15:43] time to take very serious needs very
[1:15:46] serious conditions and diseases and the
[1:15:48] man indian chief can't speak english and
[1:15:50] he comes up to the line and he and he
[1:15:52] says uh he says to to bill brother billy
[1:15:55] paul he says what's wrong with you me
[1:15:57] sick me sick and brother madam says all
[1:15:59] he could say to billy was me sick
[1:16:02] and and brother billy paul finally puts
[1:16:04] him through brother brandon prays for
[1:16:05] him and then you go on from that and
[1:16:07] brother madam says years later this man
[1:16:09] becomes converted he's converted he's
[1:16:11] born of the spirit of god and brother
[1:16:13] bannon begins to relate the story he
[1:16:14] said somebody told me he'd one time it
[1:16:16] was converted received the holy ghost
[1:16:18] and he said to him how are you getting
[1:16:20] along
[1:16:21] and this is the indian chief and he said
[1:16:24] pretty good
[1:16:25] and pretty bad
[1:16:28] now if you'd be honest today and ask you
[1:16:29] how you're doing that's what your answer
[1:16:31] would be too
[1:16:33] how you doing today
[1:16:34] pretty good
[1:16:35] and pretty bad
[1:16:38] he says
[1:16:39] well
[1:16:40] how do you mean pretty good and pretty
[1:16:42] bad he said well
[1:16:44] since me received the holy ghost he said
[1:16:47] there's been
[1:16:48] two dogs in me
[1:16:50] one of them a black dog and one of them
[1:16:52] a white dog he said they argue
[1:16:56] all the time
[1:17:00] he said they growl and they fight and at
[1:17:03] one another and said the white dog wants
[1:17:05] me to do good the black dog wants me to
[1:17:07] do bad said well chief
[1:17:10] he says he says well chief which one of
[1:17:13] them wins the fight said that depends on
[1:17:16] which one chief feeds the most
[1:17:22] which one wins whichever one i feed the
[1:17:24] most
[1:17:25] so i think that's a good answer there
[1:17:27] just depends on the warring of the body
[1:17:30] that's in you it depends on which one
[1:17:33] you cater to
[1:17:35] which nature you cater to the carnal
[1:17:38] nature notice this the carnal nature
[1:17:40] after the things of the world are the
[1:17:42] spiritual nature after the things of god
[1:17:46] that does it
[1:17:48] so in other words what's inside of me
[1:17:50] there's a nature that i've received by
[1:17:52] the baptism of the holy ghost and i have
[1:17:55] a choice every day to feed that seed or
[1:17:59] to starve that seed you as a believer
[1:18:03] have a choice every day to feed the
[1:18:05] carnal nature of the flesh with things
[1:18:08] of the world and holy wood and
[1:18:10] entertainment and you can feed that so
[1:18:12] much to where you wonder if you're even
[1:18:14] a believer at all but you've got a
[1:18:15] choice to feed on the word of god and to
[1:18:18] give that inner man spiritual food in
[1:18:20] due season
[1:18:24] you see brother brandon begins to break
[1:18:25] this down he says that's how you're born
[1:18:27] you're born in a carnal state and the
[1:18:30] prophet of god says there's always a
[1:18:32] part of you he says you're made up of
[1:18:35] body
[1:18:36] spirit
[1:18:37] and soul
[1:18:39] and he says and inside of that body
[1:18:41] there's five senses that contact the
[1:18:43] outside world and then in the spirit
[1:18:46] there's five senses that contact
[1:18:48] spiritually brother branham says there's
[1:18:50] five senses you have your memory you
[1:18:52] have your conscience you have your
[1:18:54] reasoning you have your imagination and
[1:18:56] you have your affection
[1:18:58] and brother madam says within those five
[1:19:01] spirits even after you're born of the
[1:19:03] spirit of god you still have those five
[1:19:06] senses of the spirit
[1:19:08] that can lead you astray as the flesh
[1:19:11] leads you astray it can give you a
[1:19:13] complex and it could prevent you from
[1:19:16] hindering it could hinder the word of
[1:19:17] god in your life if you don't clean out
[1:19:19] the channels
[1:19:21] remember brother branham says that's
[1:19:22] what's wrong with so many blowed up
[1:19:24] christians so many blown up believers
[1:19:26] they never clean out the channels
[1:19:29] memory conscience reasoning imagination
[1:19:31] affection
[1:19:32] and brother branham says they never
[1:19:34] clean it out and he says and they grow
[1:19:36] he says they they live because you know
[1:19:38] i've heard it said and this is a
[1:19:39] powerful thing because brother brandon
[1:19:41] begins to talk about how that he says do
[1:19:44] you believe in a guardian angel and
[1:19:45] brother madam says absolutely the bible
[1:19:47] teaches that he says when you're when
[1:19:49] you're born he says there's there's a
[1:19:51] spirit there to receive that life when
[1:19:54] it breathes its first breath
[1:19:56] and the prophet of god said and even as
[1:19:58] a little baby that angel is guarding
[1:20:00] over that soul and he's always trying to
[1:20:03] influence him always trying to woo it to
[1:20:06] himself always trying to influence that
[1:20:09] seed that's down inside of him what does
[1:20:11] he use he uses a mother a godly mother a
[1:20:14] godly father he uses a preacher a pastor
[1:20:16] it uses the word of god and he's trying
[1:20:18] to reach that child he's trying to get
[1:20:21] that child to surrender brother madam
[1:20:22] says but just as much
[1:20:24] he says as there's a angel following you
[1:20:27] there's also a spirit an evil spirit
[1:20:30] trying to destroy you
[1:20:33] remember the prophet said even i would
[1:20:35] have given my heart to the lord years
[1:20:37] before i did but there was a spirit that
[1:20:40] hung over me
[1:20:42] so there's always an evil spirit trying
[1:20:45] to call you trying to influence you and
[1:20:48] there's always a word that's trying to
[1:20:50] reach you and the word that's trying to
[1:20:52] influence you and a word that's why
[1:20:54] you're here today is because you
[1:20:56] surrendered to the influence of jesus in
[1:21:00] your life and he led you and wound you
[1:21:03] and called you unto himself
[1:21:07] but even after you're born of the spirit
[1:21:09] of god there is still that struggle down
[1:21:12] inside of you
[1:21:14] even after you're born of the spirit of
[1:21:16] god there's still a s there's still a
[1:21:19] struggle that you live with can you say
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:24] notice what the the scripture says and
[1:21:26] let me just
[1:21:27] let me just find my place i just want to
[1:21:28] read this to you because i i just
[1:21:30] believe it would be helpful if we did
[1:21:32] and so
[1:21:33] i i want you to notice this here let me
[1:21:36] just pull it up in my in my notes
[1:21:39] so
[1:21:39] we know we know we know this here the
[1:21:41] bible says all of us
[1:21:44] everybody all men this is romans 3 9
[1:21:48] are sinners
[1:21:52] say brother matt how did i start with
[1:21:53] this problem i've got sin i've got a
[1:21:55] sinful nature a carnal nature this
[1:21:57] cockleboro sticky nature all inside of
[1:22:00] me you know we could we could diagnose
[1:22:02] and we could look at and trace back the
[1:22:04] where did sin originate how did i end up
[1:22:06] like this and why do i have this and we
[1:22:08] could trace it all the way back to the
[1:22:10] garden of eden and where adam and eve
[1:22:12] fell and we could trace the origins of
[1:22:14] the problem you know but when someone
[1:22:16] has cancer they're not so much concerned
[1:22:19] on you telling them the scientific
[1:22:21] definition of cancer and how a sale
[1:22:23] begin to do this and they're not so much
[1:22:26] interested in that what they're
[1:22:27] interested in is how do i become free
[1:22:32] how can i get delivered of cancer
[1:22:35] so how do i get delivered of this
[1:22:37] problem that i was born with that i
[1:22:39] inherited that i didn't do anything to
[1:22:41] get
[1:22:42] but i find this nature down inside of
[1:22:44] myself now the bible says romans 3 it
[1:22:46] says in romans no one is good no not
[1:22:51] one
[1:22:53] and all the world
[1:22:55] is innocent
[1:22:56] it's like jordan peterson i was amazing
[1:22:59] not our brother here but jordan pierce
[1:23:01] and the the uh the professor he he just
[1:23:03] recently was converted to the to the
[1:23:05] lord through his wife his testimony of
[1:23:07] his wife you hear it it's pretty
[1:23:08] powerful and he began to just break down
[1:23:10] and and it was powerful he made a
[1:23:12] powerful statement he said really truly
[1:23:14] the only true
[1:23:16] christian
[1:23:17] that has ever lived the only true
[1:23:20] christian it's christ
[1:23:24] we're in we we want the life of christ
[1:23:26] and we walk after as paul said you
[1:23:28] follow me imitate me as i imitate christ
[1:23:30] but truly the only true christian was
[1:23:33] jesus
[1:23:35] all are
[1:23:37] sinners notice this here
[1:23:39] he says all have gone astray
[1:23:42] no one is good
[1:23:44] everyone has turned away no one has kept
[1:23:47] on doing what is right
[1:23:50] so it paints this picture of what sinful
[1:23:53] man is
[1:23:54] what a what the bible says the the heart
[1:23:57] is deceitful and desperately wicked all
[1:23:59] of sin all of i know people love to
[1:24:01] classify
[1:24:02] sin and they like to make big sin and
[1:24:04] then little sin and then they put you
[1:24:07] know this the pornography is somewhere
[1:24:09] up here and then pride is somewhere down
[1:24:11] here and then you know uh
[1:24:13] methane you know a meth addiction or
[1:24:15] some kind of drug is somewhere in here
[1:24:17] but then
[1:24:18] a temper is somewhere down in here we we
[1:24:21] like to classify sin
[1:24:23] but do you know in the eyes of god
[1:24:24] they're all sin
[1:24:27] i should get a big amen and god's eyes
[1:24:31] they're all equal
[1:24:33] all have sinned all have fallen short
[1:24:36] there is no not one all men alike are
[1:24:39] sinners
[1:24:41] or some better than others no all have
[1:24:43] sinned no one has done right no one has
[1:24:46] truly followed god the thus from the
[1:24:49] soul this is idea isaiah from the soul
[1:24:51] of the feet even to the head there's no
[1:24:53] soundness about us
[1:24:55] so sin is the disease that pollutes
[1:24:59] every part of us our body our spirit our
[1:25:02] mind our emotions
[1:25:07] all have sinned
[1:25:09] the heart is desperately wicked i know
[1:25:12] some of you
[1:25:13] maybe came here brother aaron there's a
[1:25:15] there's an entire if you could clean up
[1:25:17] those angel wings and all those halos
[1:25:19] that we just took off and ripped and
[1:25:20] threw them in the corner there
[1:25:23] what you realize is that we're all equal
[1:25:25] at the foot of the cross
[1:25:27] it's not big i and there's not a little
[1:25:28] you there's not one better not a
[1:25:30] preacher that's higher than a person
[1:25:32] sitting in the audience
[1:25:35] we're all equal
[1:25:39] and brother brandon begins to say this
[1:25:40] here and he says because that spirit
[1:25:42] that's down inside of you notice he says
[1:25:44] you're made up of body soul
[1:25:47] and
[1:25:48] and spirit
[1:25:51] and he says and inside of there he says
[1:25:52] you can you can get a complex he says
[1:25:55] even something inside of your spirit
[1:25:57] that hinders you and you watch how
[1:25:59] people are made and you've heard this
[1:26:01] statement before and i know it's very
[1:26:02] popular but it's it's a profound
[1:26:05] statement and
[1:26:06] and it's the hurt the statement says
[1:26:08] hurt people hurt people
[1:26:11] hurt people
[1:26:13] hurt people right
[1:26:16] and so you take a person who's born
[1:26:18] of a of a good family and a good home
[1:26:21] and maybe they're raised a certain way
[1:26:23] and then and then they they marry they
[1:26:25] take that person and their their their
[1:26:27] bread with all of the all of the the the
[1:26:30] brother brandon calls it the grab bag of
[1:26:32] life that's what he that's how he labels
[1:26:34] it the grab bag of life just you were
[1:26:36] born with with all of your whether they
[1:26:39] were good things or bad things i heard a
[1:26:41] man say one time your adult life is
[1:26:45] simply a reaction to your childhood your
[1:26:47] whole adult life is just a reaction of
[1:26:51] how you were as a child
[1:26:53] those good things that happened to you
[1:26:56] or those bad things that happened to you
[1:26:59] for all of us
[1:27:01] both
[1:27:04] things that we should have gotten that
[1:27:06] we didn't are the things that we didn't
[1:27:09] get that we should have whether that was
[1:27:11] love or emotion or or affection or or
[1:27:14] provision or whatever it is you're made
[1:27:17] up of all of those remember brother
[1:27:18] brandon begins to tell about the boy and
[1:27:21] it's it's even his nephew and he begins
[1:27:23] to say how this mother and this father i
[1:27:25] know that i've read this here before and
[1:27:27] he says that mother and that father came
[1:27:29] to me and he says and they said brother
[1:27:31] branham uh we don't know what to do with
[1:27:33] him he was d was dating a girl and
[1:27:35] getting serious with her about to engage
[1:27:37] her but he had this issue and the
[1:27:39] prophet doesn't say what the issue is
[1:27:42] but he said he had this this issue
[1:27:44] and and brother branham they come to him
[1:27:46] in counsel and they say our son has this
[1:27:50] problem and and we need we need help we
[1:27:53] know he's a good boy that's what they
[1:27:54] tell him we know he's a good boy but he
[1:27:57] has this hang up in this issue
[1:27:59] and he's starting to like this girl and
[1:28:01] they're starting to get serious
[1:28:03] and brother adam says now he says i
[1:28:05] started to look at them
[1:28:07] and he says and i he says i i looked at
[1:28:10] the mother and he says now look at you

[1:28:20] stoic
[1:28:21] they're very serious he says and in your
[1:28:24] family there's a strain in that family
[1:28:27] where they can't ask for forgiveness
[1:28:30] they can't it's just not in them to do
[1:28:33] it
[1:28:34] so they can't ask and say i'm sorry he
[1:28:37] says just not in them to do it brother
[1:28:39] branham says they're so just serious
[1:28:41] people it says even look at your sister
[1:28:43] he says you know just you know how she
[1:28:44] is he said she won't even hardly look at
[1:28:46] you he says her sister was the same
[1:28:48] exact way he said i i walked down the
[1:28:50] street and there she was in her yard and
[1:28:52] he looked at her and he said good
[1:28:54] morning and brother brandon says she
[1:28:56] just sat and stared at me
[1:29:00] sure fine morning
[1:29:03] brother brandon says you just stared at
[1:29:04] me look look me right in the face some
[1:29:06] of
[1:29:07] how some of you are doing to me today
[1:29:10] he said she just stared at me didn't say
[1:29:12] anything he says you should come down to
[1:29:14] the house and see us sometimes brother
[1:29:17] adam says she just sat there and stared
[1:29:19] very stoic
[1:29:20] german you know very exact very precise
[1:29:23] and brethren says now that's how your
[1:29:25] your family was he said you were bred
[1:29:27] with that that came into you but your
[1:29:29] dna and then that was passed on down to
[1:29:32] that boy
[1:29:33] and he says now look at you dad he says
[1:29:37] look at your family now brother brandon
[1:29:39] doesn't tell this on tape but this is
[1:29:40] actually brother billy paul this is only
[1:29:42] his this is brother brandon's own family
[1:29:44] my might be his cousin or his brother he
[1:29:45] says look at your family what are they
[1:29:47] they're all they're irish she says
[1:29:49] they're all fighters
[1:29:50] all of them are brawlers just he said
[1:29:53] just at that just in a moment they'll
[1:29:55] get into a fight real high strung
[1:29:57] and he says look at you he said all of
[1:29:58] them are fighters and all of them are
[1:30:00] brawlers and then he stops he says no
[1:30:02] but look at you mom
[1:30:04] you're not the way your family is
[1:30:06] they're all stoic can't ask for
[1:30:07] forgiveness
[1:30:08] he says we'll just stare at you and look
[1:30:10] at you and he says but you're not that
[1:30:12] way
[1:30:15] and he looks at the dead he says now
[1:30:16] look at you your family are all fighters
[1:30:18] and brawlers and they're all he says
[1:30:20] they they they always you know uh he
[1:30:22] says always just fighting and he says
[1:30:24] but you're not that way he says now
[1:30:26] what did that to you mom
[1:30:29] he says what did that to you dad
[1:30:32] you found the lord jesus in your life
[1:30:36] and he says and you're not the way you
[1:30:38] used to be brother branham says see when
[1:30:40] you come and become a new creature in
[1:30:42] christ i love how the prophet says it
[1:30:45] this way he says it's no more your
[1:30:48] people
[1:30:50] it's no longer your people it's your
[1:30:53] jesus living down inside of you
[1:30:56] and he says it's changed that nature
[1:30:58] down inside of you and he says now the
[1:31:00] same thing that happened to you
[1:31:03] will have to happen to that boy
[1:31:08] and the prophet says and until then
[1:31:10] i'd advise him never to get married
[1:31:13] he'd make a woman's life miserable
[1:31:18] so what what is it you're made up of
[1:31:20] body you're made up of soul made up of
[1:31:23] spirit listen how brother brandon begins
[1:31:24] to diagnose this i want you to watch and
[1:31:26] follow this if you went into a doctor's
[1:31:28] office and told him you were sick told
[1:31:30] him your symptoms and he was in a hurry
[1:31:33] he would probably give you a little
[1:31:35] prescription with some anesthetic in it
[1:31:38] of some sort some aspirin the doctor is
[1:31:41] merely trying to get rid of you just at
[1:31:44] that time because he hasn't
[1:31:47] time you know that's a lot how we treat
[1:31:49] people sometimes we don't have time for
[1:31:51] them so we just take the gospel you just
[1:31:54] need to be born again just take it you
[1:31:56] know i'm so glad that the lord jesus
[1:31:58] didn't treat me that way
[1:32:02] he says that doctor would just try to
[1:32:04] give you the medicine come into a
[1:32:05] doctor's office just take the medicine
[1:32:07] here's the prescription just get out of
[1:32:09] my office he said that doctor is just
[1:32:11] trying to get rid of you because he
[1:32:12] hasn't the time
[1:32:14] he says but a real good doctor
[1:32:16] before he give you the medicine would
[1:32:20] diagnose that case
[1:32:23] thoroughly
[1:32:26] till he found out what was wrong then
[1:32:29] give you
[1:32:30] the medicine
[1:32:32] if we're not careful that's how we treat
[1:32:35] people sometimes
[1:32:38] when when brother branham's preaching
[1:32:40] this and zacchaeus the businessman and
[1:32:42] he begins to talk about zacchaeus and
[1:32:44] how he was critical and and he was just
[1:32:47] you know he was critical of of the lord
[1:32:49] and he got up on a high tree and and he
[1:32:51] because he was a short man brother says
[1:32:53] a little short man and he couldn't he
[1:32:55] said he he's but really that that na
[1:32:57] that that that his stature his height
[1:33:00] brother branham says was a
[1:33:02] identification of his need
[1:33:05] and he says he couldn't see he says he
[1:33:07] says see zacchaeus was so critical and
[1:33:10] so skeptical but there was something
[1:33:12] that made zacchaeus that way
[1:33:15] maybe it was something down in his life
[1:33:17] down in the history of his life in a
[1:33:19] home
[1:33:20] and and you take a man you take a woman
[1:33:22] and they're both as brother brandon
[1:33:23] begins to tell the story and he says
[1:33:25] then the man's made up of this and the
[1:33:27] woman's made up of this and all their
[1:33:29] all their complexes and all their fears
[1:33:31] and all their issues and their teachers
[1:33:33] that they were raised under it the
[1:33:35] father that they had and the mother that
[1:33:36] they had and the mother that he had and
[1:33:39] the father that he had the influence of
[1:33:41] their home the atmosphere at their table
[1:33:43] the atmosphere of their house the
[1:33:45] atmosphere at their church that's what
[1:33:47] you're made up of you're made up of all
[1:33:49] of those ingredients
[1:33:52] and then you take two people that are in
[1:33:54] love with each other but yet they come
[1:33:56] from two different backgrounds two
[1:33:58] different families have different homes
[1:34:00] went to different schools had different
[1:34:01] teachers you know brother branham said
[1:34:03] all of those things
[1:34:04] are so important in your life even in
[1:34:06] leadership when he preaches about a boy
[1:34:08] and he says notice you were led from
[1:34:11] your mother and the very first love you
[1:34:13] ever had was the mother's love and he
[1:34:15] said and brother branham says you knew
[1:34:16] the love of the lord jesus because you
[1:34:19] related it to a mother's love a true
[1:34:21] mother's love is like the love of the
[1:34:23] lord jesus
[1:34:25] and he says who will love you in spite
[1:34:27] of anything and care for you no matter
[1:34:28] what and no and brother madam says you
[1:34:30] notice you started out there under the
[1:34:32] leadership of a mother and that mother
[1:34:34] led you as far as she could led you and
[1:34:36] brother madam says then there came a
[1:34:37] dispensation change and you went from
[1:34:40] the mother to the father and he says now
[1:34:42] the father is still love you're still
[1:34:44] learning love through the father prophet
[1:34:46] said it may be more corrective love than
[1:34:48] mother's love maybe it's through
[1:34:49] discipline as brother diggs preached
[1:34:51] back at home every parent is like law
[1:34:54] and grace you have law and then you have
[1:34:56] grace
[1:34:59] and brother digg says my mom was a
[1:35:00] police officer she was law all law
[1:35:04] and he says you then you go to the
[1:35:06] father and he says in that father now
[1:35:08] what is he doing he's training you he's
[1:35:09] leading you a little further he you come
[1:35:11] under the influence of that father and
[1:35:14] that father influences you in a good way
[1:35:16] or a bad way or probably a mixture of
[1:35:18] both he has his own hang-ups that he got
[1:35:22] from his dad and then his dad has his
[1:35:24] own hang-ups that he got from his dad
[1:35:27] listen there's none of us that are pure
[1:35:29] none of us are perfect we all are a
[1:35:32] mixture of good and bad and evil and
[1:35:34] righteous and all of us are a big grab
[1:35:37] bag of all of the things that make up us
[1:35:41] and brother brandon says then you go
[1:35:42] from the mother and then you let
[1:35:44] transfer that to the father and brother
[1:35:46] madam says then you're under the
[1:35:47] tutelage of that father and that
[1:35:49] father's instructing you and teaching
[1:35:51] you discipline and teaching you what it
[1:35:52] means to be a man and teach you know
[1:35:54] what it means to go to work and teaching
[1:35:56] you what it means to to you know you
[1:35:57] know take care of a one of a family
[1:36:00] remember that says then you move and you
[1:36:01] you go and there's a dispensational
[1:36:03] change again and you graduate from that
[1:36:05] mother to that father and now he says
[1:36:07] maybe you're teachers at school and he
[1:36:09] says and those teachers who will teach
[1:36:10] you they lead you a little bit further
[1:36:12] maybe the sunday school teacher and he
[1:36:14] says you come and you transition and
[1:36:16] they teach you and train you then you go
[1:36:18] from there to your employer
[1:36:20] then you go from there and he said
[1:36:21] you're out on your own and all of those
[1:36:23] things that you're made up of that boy
[1:36:26] and that girl when they get married he
[1:36:28] says they're made up of all of the
[1:36:30] differences and all of the complexes all
[1:36:32] of the atmospheres the good things that
[1:36:34] happen the bad things that happen maybe
[1:36:37] that mother maybe that girl went through
[1:36:39] a time of sorrow and maybe there was
[1:36:41] cancer in the family and she lost a
[1:36:43] loved one and maybe that boy had a dad
[1:36:45] who was militant and he was always on
[1:36:47] top of him and always just performed and
[1:36:50] everything was about performance and
[1:36:51] then he grew up to estimate his worth
[1:36:53] based upon how well he performed maybe
[1:36:56] he had a a mother who was uh didn't care
[1:36:58] how he lived and never taught him the
[1:37:00] bible never taught him about the lord
[1:37:01] jesus and then he grows up maybe had an
[1:37:04] uncle or a home or at the atmosphere of
[1:37:06] their church didn't preach the word of
[1:37:07] god maybe preached a hybrid virgin
[1:37:10] brother madam says all of those things
[1:37:12] that make you up then you take all of
[1:37:13] those differences
[1:37:15] and then you marry them together
[1:37:18] and inside of that union and that
[1:37:20] relationship of all of those things that
[1:37:22] are made up he says are all of those
[1:37:24] good all of that bad all of the good
[1:37:27] atmosphere the bad atmosphere the good
[1:37:30] experiences the bad experiences
[1:37:34] and the prophet of god says and if
[1:37:35] you're not careful if you don't
[1:37:37] constantly clean out the channels
[1:37:40] and constantly you say brother matt what
[1:37:42] and i want to just say this here because
[1:37:44] i want to make sure i don't get lost
[1:37:46] it's what the lord really burdened my
[1:37:47] heart with because i'm preaching to you
[1:37:49] today on the sermon title is being
[1:37:51] changed let me give my title that was
[1:37:54] that's my title being changed
[1:37:56] and if i can't if i don't want to lose
[1:37:58] this one thing i want to convey to you
[1:38:00] this morning when you're born of the
[1:38:02] spirit of god there's a part of you that
[1:38:05] is instantly changed from one kingdom of
[1:38:08] darkness to a kingdom of light
[1:38:11] you are changed when you're born of the
[1:38:13] spirit of god when you're born of the
[1:38:15] spirit of god you're changed there's a
[1:38:17] part of you that's changed but there's
[1:38:20] also a part of you that's
[1:38:23] being changed
[1:38:26] and you
[1:38:27] must i hope i could emphasize this and
[1:38:30] highlight it have it on a neon sign you
[1:38:33] must of necessity constantly be being
[1:38:38] changed you cannot stop i don't care how
[1:38:42] far the lord has brought you in your
[1:38:43] mind your marriage your spirit your
[1:38:45] relationship in your church as a
[1:38:47] believer you can never stop changing and
[1:38:51] growing and progressing don't ever stop
[1:38:54] as a believer you must continue to be
[1:38:58] changed there's got to be a desire from
[1:39:00] a christian from a believer to say lord
[1:39:02] you've brought me a mighty long way but
[1:39:04] i've got a long way to go and i want you
[1:39:06] to constantly change me evolve me let me
[1:39:10] always be cleaning out my mind let me be
[1:39:12] cleaning out my spirit always be moving
[1:39:15] on
[1:39:18] experience with the lord is not a
[1:39:20] one-off time one time you met the lord
[1:39:22] but it's a daily walk it's a daily
[1:39:25] relationship it's a daily battle that
[1:39:27] you're constantly in and you've got to
[1:39:30] keep moving
[1:39:32] on
[1:39:34] don't ever stop being
[1:39:38] changed i said brother how how's my body
[1:39:41] going to change let me just say this the
[1:39:43] body change will just be the final
[1:39:45] change that god brings in your life
[1:39:50] but until then you're cleaning out
[1:39:52] you're moving out you say i've tasted of
[1:39:54] the lord but i need more
[1:39:56] i've been filled with the spirit but
[1:39:58] i've got to be constantly being refilled
[1:40:02] you know you ought to wake up every day
[1:40:03] and say lord refill me one more time
[1:40:05] with your spirit
[1:40:06] refill me one more time lord
[1:40:09] clean out my memory my conscience my
[1:40:11] imagination my affection listen to what
[1:40:13] brother branham says here sometimes we
[1:40:15] find people going for the prayer lines
[1:40:16] across the nations and they just run up
[1:40:18] and think the lord ought to heal them
[1:40:19] right then but there's something maybe
[1:40:21] down in there and we set before the lord
[1:40:23] until he reveals it
[1:40:24] until he reveals that what it is then
[1:40:27] there's there's something now notice i
[1:40:29] got it in capital here and i want you to
[1:40:30] remember this there's a reason
[1:40:33] for
[1:40:35] everything
[1:40:37] there's a reason
[1:40:40] for
[1:40:40] everything
[1:40:43] and you've got to find the reason and
[1:40:45] then you can find what to work on
[1:40:47] i find someone now listen what brother
[1:40:49] adam says now excuse me on the
[1:40:51] interviews this morning i guess they're
[1:40:53] still here in the building that about
[1:40:55] speaking with tongues now brother
[1:40:56] brandon preaches that this is in
[1:40:57] questions and answers and he preaches
[1:40:58] that morning
[1:41:00] against what the pentecostal church is
[1:41:02] preaching that the evidence of the
[1:41:03] baptism of the holy ghost is to speak it
[1:41:06] next now i want to just say this and i
[1:41:07] know i've said this here before
[1:41:09] brother branham was not against at all
[1:41:11] whatsoever in fact he was the polar
[1:41:13] opposite of what you could say
[1:41:15] brother adam was not against speaking in
[1:41:16] tongues
[1:41:18] in fact he was the direct opposite of
[1:41:20] that
[1:41:21] but brother adam was against preaching
[1:41:23] that the evidence of the baptism of the
[1:41:24] holy ghost is that you speak with
[1:41:26] tongues
[1:41:27] brother paul says the bible clearly says
[1:41:28] not all speak with tongues so that's not
[1:41:31] what we're preaching on this morning i
[1:41:32] want you to notice brother brandon
[1:41:33] preaches this entire message and he says
[1:41:35] i just preached how the evidence of the
[1:41:37] holy ghost is not speaking in tongues
[1:41:39] and he says now
[1:41:41] he says the person is a genuine person a
[1:41:44] real person and they've lived right
[1:41:46] and they've heard me say the evidence of
[1:41:48] the holy ghost wasn't speaking in
[1:41:49] tongues and it isn't but i advise that
[1:41:52] person to ask god to let them either
[1:41:55] speak in tongues or prophesy
[1:41:59] now you just took the entire sermon to
[1:42:01] tell us how that speaking in tongues was
[1:42:03] not the evidence but now you've
[1:42:04] counseled with this sister
[1:42:07] and you counseled her and told her you
[1:42:10] should ask the lord to let you speak in
[1:42:12] tongues
[1:42:13] or prophesy why
[1:42:15] because it's the nature
[1:42:19] because it's the nature the nature of
[1:42:22] what the nature of this person brother
[1:42:24] bradham discerned and knew that she
[1:42:27] would always live in a constant state of
[1:42:29] unrest until she had a she had an
[1:42:32] experience of speaking in tongues she
[1:42:34] would always wrestle within herself
[1:42:37] because why that's how she was made
[1:42:39] you may not be made that way but she was
[1:42:43] listen to what brother madam says
[1:42:44] the first thing i went to that person
[1:42:47] and found their
[1:42:49] birthplace
[1:42:51] birthplace
[1:42:53] so you mean my birthplace has something
[1:42:56] to do with how i'm natured and how i'm
[1:42:58] made
[1:43:00] yes
[1:43:02] brother adam says and what sign
[1:43:05] they were born remember we were talking
[1:43:07] about i was talking with my son about
[1:43:08] this he says and what sign they were
[1:43:10] born under so brother branham as a
[1:43:12] prophet sees this person look finds out
[1:43:15] where she was born finds out what star
[1:43:17] what sign she was born under you know
[1:43:20] brother bran and believed in that first
[1:43:22] first bible was a strong was in the
[1:43:24] stars that's what brother branham said
[1:43:26] and he says i found out what sign she
[1:43:28] was born under
[1:43:30] and could tell what their birth was
[1:43:33] notice
[1:43:34] which way it said in their natural
[1:43:36] nature sets them in a certain line
[1:43:41] then when they're born again they're
[1:43:43] over here in another nature now notice
[1:43:45] what brother branham says this is with
[1:43:46] this woman he begins to diagnose this
[1:43:48] woman and he says there's a nature down
[1:43:51] inside of her
[1:43:52] she's born under a certain place she's
[1:43:54] born under a certain sign and because
[1:43:56] she's born and made that way i told her
[1:43:59] you should ask the lord to let you speak
[1:44:01] in tongues because he knew that would
[1:44:03] clinch
[1:44:04] something inside of her
[1:44:06] say would the lord jesus do that for me
[1:44:09] brother branham answers the question i
[1:44:11] love this so much he's he's asked the
[1:44:13] questions and questions and answers and
[1:44:15] says brother branham the bible says in
[1:44:17] the book of james lay your hands upon
[1:44:18] the sick and they shall recover and he
[1:44:20] says but then over here the roman
[1:44:22] centurion he comes and just says to the
[1:44:24] lord
[1:44:25] speak the word and jesus says no great
[1:44:27] faith no greater faith if i found in all
[1:44:29] of jerusalem so brother adam says the
[1:44:31] person asked the question says i don't
[1:44:32] understand brother branham i thought
[1:44:34] that the to the gentile true gentile
[1:44:36] faith is not to come and have a laying
[1:44:38] on of hands but just to believe the word
[1:44:40] of god brother branham says now he says
[1:44:42] you must understand he says i love this
[1:44:45] the prophet's simplicity he says
[1:44:49] so one person needs something this woman
[1:44:53] needed
[1:44:54] a physical manifestation some people
[1:44:57] need that
[1:44:59] some people need to come out of their
[1:45:00] seat and come to an altar and have a
[1:45:04] minister lay their hands on them and
[1:45:05] pray the prayer of faith the bible says
[1:45:07] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:45:09] others by faith can receive it right
[1:45:11] where they're at not mentally not
[1:45:13] talking about that but they can receive
[1:45:15] that same thing down in their spirit
[1:45:17] brother says but why would god do both
[1:45:20] because the prophet says because
[1:45:22] remember god will always meet you
[1:45:26] at whatever level of faith you can come
[1:45:29] to
[1:45:30] he'll never stop oh i'm so glad for that
[1:45:32] brother aaron he'll never stop and say
[1:45:34] you know what you don't need something
[1:45:35] you should just believe my word and you
[1:45:37] can't accept it you've got to be here
[1:45:39] brother says he never does that he'll
[1:45:41] meet you at whatever he'll come down to
[1:45:43] your level oh how many are here and can
[1:45:46] say i'm so glad jesus came to my level
[1:45:49] he met me no matter how low i was he
[1:45:52] reached down to my level
[1:45:56] brother man says he'll meet you at
[1:45:57] whatever level of faith you have
[1:46:02] he'll never stop on a technicality
[1:46:05] but he looks at the heart
[1:46:08] he says he says and then when you find
[1:46:10] out this nature that's the inside uh
[1:46:13] in conscience inside conscience now it's
[1:46:17] been one of the greatest listen to what
[1:46:18] he says here he says it's been one of
[1:46:20] the most amazing things i've noticed
[1:46:22] along the lines of my ministry of our
[1:46:23] lord jesus is the peculiarity
[1:46:26] of people how peculiar some people are
[1:46:33] i know some of you are laughing
[1:46:35] you go man he's a strange bird
[1:46:39] yeah we're different one from another
[1:46:43] and that's how god made us
[1:46:47] don't
[1:46:48] try to be me
[1:46:50] and i won't try to be you
[1:46:52] and will both be pleasing to the lord
[1:46:55] remember the brother brother adam says
[1:46:57] uh
[1:46:58] let me just move on i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:46:59] get to this got too much keep getting
[1:47:00] stopped and he says
[1:47:03] uh he says the study of he says now
[1:47:05] is the peculiarity of people and the
[1:47:07] study of human life is one of the
[1:47:10] greatest things that a person can study
[1:47:12] to watch nature of people it's been one
[1:47:14] of the most amazing things notice and
[1:47:15] the different parts of the nations of
[1:47:16] the world where you go you'll notice
[1:47:18] that there's a difference there's a
[1:47:19] different attitude that people take
[1:47:20] towards christ towards the service
[1:47:21] towards his servants towards worship one
[1:47:23] of the things has been that one type of
[1:47:25] meeting in other words to preach a
[1:47:27] sermon over here would just be wonderful
[1:47:29] in one part of the country where it
[1:47:31] won't work in the other part of the
[1:47:33] country
[1:47:34] so he says notice this there's it's
[1:47:36] different because people are
[1:47:38] different
[1:47:42] you say then how how should i be brother
[1:47:45] matt then that's just that's just i'm
[1:47:47] just an i'm i'm just an american no
[1:47:49] you're not
[1:47:52] no you're not you're a citizen from
[1:47:53] above
[1:47:55] well that's just how my that's just how
[1:47:57] i was
[1:47:58] was raised well that might be fine but
[1:48:00] what if how you were raised was not
[1:48:01] pleasing to the lord
[1:48:03] you say brother matthew whose nature do
[1:48:05] i subject subject myself to this this
[1:48:08] nature
[1:48:10] and the new nature that you receive is
[1:48:12] the nature of the word
[1:48:16] and that's why paul says when you're in
[1:48:18] behold whoever's in christ is a
[1:48:21] new creature
[1:48:24] all things are passed away behold all
[1:48:26] things have become new
[1:48:29] notice and he says now notice brother
[1:48:31] begins today i'm going to close here i
[1:48:32] know we're out of time
[1:48:34] he begins here to
[1:48:37] to come to this place i want to make
[1:48:39] sure i don't
[1:48:41] skip this
[1:48:45] he says excuse me sister i have to relax
[1:48:48] my mind once in a while now we'll be
[1:48:49] strangers i see that you're strictly a
[1:48:51] stranger to me you're you're from away
[1:48:53] from here you've come from another city
[1:48:55] you've got a lot of trouble on your
[1:48:57] heart
[1:48:58] and you've got heart trouble to begin
[1:48:59] with is that right there's a whole lot
[1:49:01] of blackness i see a black sheep keep
[1:49:04] following you like that now brother
[1:49:06] adams this is a prayer line you can go
[1:49:07] watch this in 20th century prophet and
[1:49:09] watch it on video
[1:49:11] and he's beginning to tell the sister
[1:49:13] now here she's a believer
[1:49:15] she's born of the spirit of god she's
[1:49:17] got the baptism of the holy ghost but
[1:49:19] the prophet through a prophetic gift
[1:49:22] begins to discern and he says there's a
[1:49:23] blackness
[1:49:25] there's something there's a sheet
[1:49:26] there's something over you like a dark a
[1:49:28] dart a dark cloud
[1:49:30] and he says and brother branham says oh
[1:49:33] he says he says you've got a lot of
[1:49:34] trouble now notice you've got a lot of
[1:49:36] trouble on your heart and you've got
[1:49:38] hard trouble
[1:49:40] is that right there's a whole lot of
[1:49:42] blackness i see a black sheet
[1:49:44] keep following you like that oh
[1:49:47] it's a lie
[1:49:49] somebody's told a lie on you
[1:49:52] and that was a man professing divine
[1:49:54] healing you could hear the sister on the
[1:49:56] tape begin to cry and say that's that's
[1:49:58] right that's right brother branham he
[1:50:00] said you was a witch yes is that true
[1:50:03] and you've got a whole stir in your
[1:50:05] church or something another about it is
[1:50:07] that right you're pastor sick right now
[1:50:09] he's got polio is that right yes sir
[1:50:12] sister
[1:50:13] don't pay no attention to what them
[1:50:15] people tell you they're a lion
[1:50:18] and the only things wrong with your
[1:50:20] heart is that your nervous conditions
[1:50:23] got your heart worked up so this woman
[1:50:26] literally has an outward heart problem
[1:50:30] because of an inward disease that's not
[1:50:33] her heart
[1:50:35] she's born of the spirit of god but
[1:50:37] there's something that she's ingested
[1:50:40] in her spirit
[1:50:43] and it's affected her outside
[1:50:47] brother adam says now it's a lie
[1:50:49] somebody's told a lie on you
[1:50:51] and he says that man's professing to be
[1:50:53] divine healing he says they're a lion he
[1:50:56] says the only thing's wrong with you
[1:50:57] he's got your condition your heart god
[1:50:59] worked up go home in peace
[1:51:01] and god bless you you're all right god
[1:51:04] bless you you're not
[1:51:06] a witch
[1:51:10] do you see what happened you say brother
[1:51:12] matt what happened to that woman the
[1:51:14] light of the word exposed the devil in
[1:51:18] her spirit and she was free just like
[1:51:20] that
[1:51:22] say then what does it take brother now
[1:51:23] how can i become free let the light of
[1:51:25] the word of god shine down on your
[1:51:28] spirit move down into any complex any
[1:51:31] bitterness any jealousy any issues any
[1:51:34] grab bag of life that you've received
[1:51:36] let the word shine down on you and say
[1:51:39] lord shine on me shine in every part and
[1:51:41] fabric of my being expose any lie of the
[1:51:45] devil
[1:51:47] how many want that here today
[1:51:49] say lord i want you to expose any lie of
[1:51:51] the devil inside of my heart that's
[1:51:53] preventing me
[1:51:54] from coming to the image of your word
[1:51:57] notice how brother adam says this you
[1:51:59] believe with all your heart believe god
[1:52:01] will heal you of that tb believe he'll
[1:52:02] make you well if i ask him lord jesus i
[1:52:05] pray you'll heal the woman she may get
[1:52:06] completely whole this is what he prays
[1:52:08] for her go on your word rejoicing and
[1:52:10] his brother adam begins to tell this
[1:52:12] story here
[1:52:13] then strangely i went to a place or made
[1:52:16] an odd turn now this is the message he
[1:52:18] cares do you care instead of turning
[1:52:20] around i went to make a turn the lights
[1:52:21] flashed on a lovely couple on the
[1:52:23] outside two fine young ladies that i
[1:52:25] just married the two fine young
[1:52:26] ministers and satan after he'd seen the
[1:52:28] minister one of them his ministry being
[1:52:30] set took a life's companion right here
[1:52:32] at this altar they went away happily on
[1:52:34] their honeymoon and the enemy jumped on
[1:52:37] this young man brother branham marries
[1:52:39] them
[1:52:40] he's a minister marries a woman they go
[1:52:43] off on their honeymoon
[1:52:45] and then the enemy jumps on this man and
[1:52:48] brother branham says and i'm saying this
[1:52:49] to express what i'm saying does he care
[1:52:52] somehow with faith that would not take
[1:52:54] no they turned and returned back here
[1:52:57] knowing after they was all the way over
[1:53:00] way in the east here somewhere on their
[1:53:02] honeymoon returned back and was sitting
[1:53:04] waiting i walked in fine handsome young
[1:53:05] man his wife sitting on the outside
[1:53:07] crying her their little companion
[1:53:10] and the other man and the other brother
[1:53:12] coming running which is a friend of this
[1:53:13] young man saying oh brother branham such
[1:53:15] and such has happened we went there and
[1:53:17] seen this handsome young man sitting
[1:53:19] there just in the peak of his life a
[1:53:20] leader of the young of young men sitting
[1:53:22] there notice and satan bound him you say
[1:53:25] how
[1:53:26] did this happen to this fine young man
[1:53:29] here he marries this woman
[1:53:30] brother adam just prays over them just
[1:53:32] marries them and he says and now the
[1:53:35] enemy jumps on this man and he doesn't
[1:53:37] give us the details maybe an argument a
[1:53:39] blow up something happen just that fast
[1:53:42] and they come back and brother brandon
[1:53:43] says i looked at the young man here's
[1:53:45] the woman she's sitting in the car
[1:53:47] crying looked at this man satan had
[1:53:49] bound him
[1:53:51] he never noticed but i took my hand left
[1:53:53] to shake with his right with his hand
[1:53:54] right to see if some disease had plagued
[1:53:56] him but there was no sign of vibration
[1:53:59] coming right out of the room from
[1:54:01] praying and fasting and waiting upon the
[1:54:02] lord the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:54:04] was there and that's why it led us see
[1:54:06] and then seeing the shadow of darkness
[1:54:09] over him i never said what i was doing
[1:54:11] but in less than a couple of moments
[1:54:13] time it was all gone the coldness of his
[1:54:17] hands left he was shouting and praising
[1:54:19] god
[1:54:20] notice these words a few minutes to find
[1:54:24] himself
[1:54:27] and here they sit right here this
[1:54:29] morning sitting in the audience see i
[1:54:32] love this see how satan was trying to
[1:54:35] upset that young man by referring to him
[1:54:38] of some complex
[1:54:40] to be built back
[1:54:43] so it's something he had previously
[1:54:47] a complex that he had previously
[1:54:50] that the lord had taken away from him
[1:54:52] and now satan jumped on him trying to
[1:54:55] build that complex back she said brother
[1:54:57] matt why is that important because now
[1:54:58] you take a son of god a minister of the
[1:55:01] gospel and yet he has something in his
[1:55:04] spirit something that you don't see by
[1:55:06] looking at him something that you don't
[1:55:08] sense but god's prophet begins to take
[1:55:10] him into an interview and begins to
[1:55:12] discern his life and there's something
[1:55:14] in his past
[1:55:19] that was now affecting his presence
[1:55:23] something that he had never let given
[1:55:26] maybe something to that he had never
[1:55:29] fully given to the lord
[1:55:33] remember what brother branham says
[1:55:35] there's a reason for
[1:55:37] everything
[1:55:40] he says you notice so many blown up
[1:55:42] christians
[1:55:43] like a boiler that's that's the example
[1:55:46] that he gives he says like a boiler down
[1:55:48] a lot he says is building up pressure
[1:55:50] and building up pressure and building up
[1:55:51] pressure he says but if the flu
[1:55:54] if the flu of the exhaust is never
[1:55:56] cleaned out and the flu begins to get
[1:55:58] clogged he says eventually if you don't
[1:56:01] clean out that flu that boiler would
[1:56:03] just
[1:56:04] blow up
[1:56:06] and you watch so many people after
[1:56:08] serving the lord for so many years and
[1:56:10] they never clean out the channels and
[1:56:12] then suddenly boom
[1:56:14] there's a big blow up
[1:56:16] you say brother matt what are some of
[1:56:18] those things that clog up the channels
[1:56:21] unforgiveness grudges
[1:56:24] bitterness
[1:56:25] complexes jealousies
[1:56:28] envies
[1:56:32] maybe something that
[1:56:34] that happens between a man and a woman a
[1:56:36] father and a son a mother and a daughter
[1:56:38] and then you watch how little things the
[1:56:41] satan will take any kind of little thing
[1:56:43] and he'll put something and twist it and
[1:56:45] pervert it in your mind and then you
[1:56:47] start to believe that lie
[1:56:49] and then that lie after a while uh-huh
[1:56:52] okay you see
[1:56:53] brother branham says and he noticed this
[1:56:55] he says notice what happens to you when
[1:56:57] you're born of the spirit of god
[1:56:58] and he talks about that old indian chief
[1:57:00] that had that na that white dog and he
[1:57:02] says that black dog and says which one
[1:57:04] wins chief which one ever whichever one
[1:57:05] i feed the most you see you can feed a
[1:57:08] lie from the devil you can feed a
[1:57:10] complex from the devil
[1:57:12] or you could choose to say deliver me of
[1:57:14] that
[1:57:15] it's a no it's a lie in the first place
[1:57:20] and brother branham says notice here he
[1:57:22] says he never cleaned out that channel
[1:57:23] that flew he says what what happens he
[1:57:26] says what what happens to that man and
[1:57:28] he says maybe a lie maybe a complex
[1:57:30] maybe a grudge maybe unforgiveness maybe
[1:57:32] bitterness and he says then it suddenly
[1:57:34] like a cancer takes root inside of that
[1:57:36] man remember there's a reason for
[1:57:39] everything
[1:57:42] right
[1:57:44] and brother brandon says he never cleans
[1:57:45] out that channel
[1:57:47] and then maybe something happens in that
[1:57:49] relationship between that woman and that
[1:57:51] man and then something so small and then
[1:57:54] he begins to believe that and then that
[1:57:56] tense his vision and now he sees
[1:57:58] everything through yellow colored or
[1:58:00] whatever color of your complex
[1:58:02] you see everything through those glasses
[1:58:06] and brother branham says he never cleans
[1:58:09] out the channels
[1:58:11] and then eventually he builds up that
[1:58:13] pressure and builds up that pressure and
[1:58:15] then
[1:58:15] boom a bomb goes off and you don't even
[1:58:17] know where did it even come from it was
[1:58:20] like the the titanic that that that
[1:58:22] sinks and it you just had to it just you
[1:58:25] say how to the sink you see this little
[1:58:26] iceberg that was just sitting up out of
[1:58:28] the water but you see that was just the
[1:58:30] tip of the iceberg
[1:58:32] underneath what you couldn't see
[1:58:35] is usually what causes the problem
[1:58:39] it's not the outward little
[1:58:41] manifestations you see but usually under
[1:58:44] every battery a little small to usually
[1:58:46] you're only seeing the tip of the
[1:58:48] iceberg
[1:58:49] are you with me here church
[1:58:52] and that you don't see that that down
[1:58:54] inside there there's a complex
[1:58:56] that's taken a hold of that person or or
[1:59:00] something down inside that they fed and
[1:59:02] they begin to feed that and they begin
[1:59:03] to feed that and brother brandon says it
[1:59:05] this way he says you notice how he says
[1:59:07] when you're born of that he says when
[1:59:09] you're not when you're before you're
[1:59:11] regenerated before you're converted now
[1:59:13] just listen close i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:59:15] close here in just a few minutes
[1:59:18] he says before you're converted he says
[1:59:20] satan
[1:59:21] lives on the dominion he lives on the
[1:59:23] throne he lives on the he's the king
[1:59:25] he's that he's living in the control
[1:59:27] room
[1:59:29] and he says he's the man pulling the
[1:59:31] levers and he says he's the man pushing
[1:59:33] the buttons
[1:59:35] and you can you can try to reform him
[1:59:37] and as i was explaining to my cousin i
[1:59:39] said you you could do everything you
[1:59:41] want to try to clean up the outside
[1:59:44] and he says you can do everything you
[1:59:45] can to try to clean up the outside but
[1:59:47] until you deal with that that inside of
[1:59:49] the inside of the inside of who you
[1:59:51] really are not who people see on the
[1:59:53] outside you'll always be a slave and
[1:59:55] it'll always be your master
[1:59:58] and brother baron says see what happens
[2:00:00] when you're born of the spirit of god he
[2:00:02] says that that he says before you're
[2:00:04] born of the spirit of god he says then
[2:00:06] satan sits on the throne of your heart
[2:00:09] and he's
[2:00:10] you're under his command and he says but
[2:00:12] when you receive the baptism of the holy
[2:00:15] ghost he says now he's removed from the
[2:00:19] throne room
[2:00:21] and the spirit of christ now lives
[2:00:23] inside of the throne
[2:00:26] and now the spirit of the holy ghost is
[2:00:28] pushing the buttons thank god and
[2:00:31] pulling the levers
[2:00:32] and he says but satan removes he moves
[2:00:36] from a place of dominion
[2:00:38] and he moves to a place of influence
[2:00:44] and now he's not in control
[2:00:47] per se
[2:00:49] but he's still in that spot trying to
[2:00:51] influence you
[2:00:53] trying to whisper to you trying to lie
[2:00:56] to you and he'll tell you every kind of
[2:00:58] a lie and build any kind of a complex
[2:01:00] and build any kind of jealousy in any
[2:01:01] kind of malice he's not in control but
[2:01:04] he's been removed and he's now he's in a
[2:01:06] point of influence
[2:01:08] and whichever one you feed the most will
[2:01:11] be the one that wins
[2:01:16] and and the prophet of god says
[2:01:20] he says now he takes take a man like
[2:01:22] legion
[2:01:23] and he starts
[2:01:25] with just one spirit
[2:01:27] brother branham says it was could have
[2:01:29] been a temper
[2:01:32] and he says that he never brought under
[2:01:34] subjection to the word of god
[2:01:37] he's born again of the spirit of god
[2:01:39] he's a new creature in christ
[2:01:42] the holy ghost you say brother matt what
[2:01:44] are you coming to coming down to the
[2:01:46] crux of my sermon
[2:01:48] the holy ghost changes
[2:01:54] every part of you
[2:01:56] except one
[2:01:59] because you've only received the down
[2:02:01] payment
[2:02:02] you've only received the earnest you
[2:02:04] still as brother branham said you still
[2:02:06] have this nature
[2:02:08] this sticky nature
[2:02:10] and that nature has the ability to lead
[2:02:13] you astray
[2:02:14] to give you the wrong directions
[2:02:17] and you end up in a dead-end street
[2:02:21] say but i'm bored of the spirit of god
[2:02:23] i've got the holy spirit to guide me not
[2:02:26] if you don't feed that spirit
[2:02:29] not if you don't if you lean to your own
[2:02:31] understanding
[2:02:34] born of the spirit of god
[2:02:36] that holy spirit has changed every part
[2:02:38] of you but it hasn't changed notice
[2:02:41] every part of you one day
[2:02:44] it'll change every part of you
[2:02:46] the what is the fullness of adoption the
[2:02:49] fullness of adoption is a change of my
[2:02:51] body
[2:02:52] when brother branham says that cockle
[2:02:54] burrow is no more cockle barrel now the
[2:02:56] outside cockroach turns into wheat life
[2:03:00] what's living on this inside of you
[2:03:02] right now zoe life wheat life
[2:03:06] real true life real true life what's
[2:03:08] living on the outside a sticky carnal
[2:03:10] nature so what do i have to do what is
[2:03:12] the struggle to bring this old carnal
[2:03:15] nature subject to the inner word of god
[2:03:18] that lives on the inside of me to feed
[2:03:20] that nature down inside of me to starve
[2:03:23] out this nature
[2:03:25] and brother madam says now that complex
[2:03:27] can start and legion started maybe with
[2:03:29] just his temper
[2:03:31] and i was a family man had a wife had
[2:03:33] children but he began brother adam says
[2:03:35] started with that never brought a
[2:03:37] subject and then he starts with one
[2:03:41] now you say well that's just a you know
[2:03:43] that's just a habit brother man it's
[2:03:45] just a habit that happened brother
[2:03:46] branham said habits are spirits
[2:03:52] don't ever just call it a habit it's a
[2:03:54] spirit
[2:03:55] and that man starts with one spirit
[2:03:57] maybe alcohol i think brother branham
[2:03:59] actually says that in one place
[2:04:01] he says it was maybe alcohol but he
[2:04:03] never got over it never overcame it and
[2:04:06] you know what one complex will do it
[2:04:08] just makes a platform and a foundation
[2:04:12] for another complex
[2:04:15] and then that builds a foundation for
[2:04:17] another spirit
[2:04:18] and then that builds a foundation for
[2:04:20] another spirit and you give access
[2:04:22] through one thing in your spirit give
[2:04:24] access and that's why the apostle paul
[2:04:26] says be not entangled again
[2:04:30] with a yoke of bondage
[2:04:34] as a believer you can be entangled and
[2:04:36] entrapped again and legion remember what
[2:04:38] legion means that wasn't his name you
[2:04:40] ever heard of the man named legion in
[2:04:41] the bible no you haven't heard of the
[2:04:43] man named legion because that wasn't the
[2:04:45] man's name
[2:04:46] that was the name that was the word for
[2:04:48] 2
[2:04:49] 000 spirits
[2:04:52] could you imagine how does a person
[2:04:55] end up with 2
[2:04:57] 000 demons
[2:05:00] how brother matt
[2:05:03] one
[2:05:04] at a time
[2:05:07] and that one spirit leads to another
[2:05:09] spirit leads to another spirit leads to
[2:05:11] another spirit jesus says when a man is
[2:05:13] unclean spirit is going out of a man it
[2:05:15] goes into dry places seeking rest and
[2:05:18] then he comes back and the house is
[2:05:20] swept and it's clean and it's sanctified
[2:05:22] and it's in church but the the strongman
[2:05:26] the lord jesus isn't there guarding the
[2:05:28] door
[2:05:30] he's not guarding the door
[2:05:32] and he says so he brings in seven other
[2:05:35] spirits with him
[2:05:37] and jesus says the condition of the man
[2:05:39] of the first of the last the latter was
[2:05:41] worse than before he started
[2:05:45] you see why it's so important not just
[2:05:48] to be sanctified and to clean up your
[2:05:50] life and to get the right dress code and
[2:05:52] get the right hair length and get the
[2:05:53] right skirt length and make sure
[2:05:55] everything looks the part listen friends
[2:05:58] if the real true zoe c gene life has
[2:06:00] came alive on you the outside will clean
[2:06:03] up itself
[2:06:05] but you're such a dangerous spot if all
[2:06:07] you've done is clean the outside and
[2:06:10] you've never filled the inside
[2:06:12] oh i say today lord may you feel me how
[2:06:15] many can join in and say lord i want you
[2:06:18] to feel me every part of me my body my
[2:06:20] soul my spirit dispel any sickness or
[2:06:23] any disease in my of a complex or
[2:06:25] bitterness in my heart how many kids
[2:06:28] stand to their feet and raise their
[2:06:29] hands and say lord i want that here
[2:06:31] today stand up and raise your hand wave
[2:06:33] it to the lord say lord jesus i want you
[2:06:36] to come and clean out every channel let
[2:06:38] the flu let the exhaust be clean so that
[2:06:41] i can live and feed the right spirit
[2:06:44] within me lord may you did may you
[2:06:46] destroy every complex every lie every
[2:06:49] fear
[2:06:50] everything that would be unlike you lord
[2:06:52] jesus how many could raise their hand
[2:06:54] and just close those eyes and bow to the
[2:06:55] lord and say lord jesus
[2:06:57] i want you to come right now i want you
[2:07:00] to clean out every channel in my heart i
[2:07:02] want to be changed i'm so glad i could
[2:07:05] say today you changed me when i met you
[2:07:08] but today lord i'm in a desire for more
[2:07:11] change i want to see more change in my
[2:07:13] life lord i i don't never want to settle
[2:07:17] i don't ever want to settle no matter
[2:07:19] how far i've gotten i don't ever want to
[2:07:22] sit still
[2:07:24] i want to move on
[2:07:26] i want to move on with the lord jesus
[2:07:29] [Music]
[2:07:32] i want to move on with his word
[2:07:35] grant it to us lord
[2:07:41] granted to us
[2:07:43] i'm speaking to people every head bowed
[2:07:45] ever i closed
[2:07:47] speaking to people lord just
[2:07:49] like myself
[2:07:52] all of us raised
[2:07:55] different places different
[2:07:57] underdipped and atmospheres all of us
[2:07:59] even after our home maybe we were in the
[2:08:00] perfect home had good godly parents that
[2:08:04] were raised raised us in the admonition
[2:08:05] of god and maybe even after we got out
[2:08:08] of their home maybe we were subjected to
[2:08:10] the wrong friends their own crowds
[2:08:13] the wrong things
[2:08:16] maybe through this life because this
[2:08:18] life is full of tribulation
[2:08:20] that's what you said
[2:08:23] maybe sorrow or
[2:08:25] something
[2:08:26] came upon our life lord that
[2:08:29] that is
[2:08:30] as your prophet describes even that
[2:08:33] little wheat
[2:08:35] as your prophet was looking across that
[2:08:37] field and he sees all those wheat
[2:08:39] standing straight up the corn the corn
[2:08:41] stalk and he says all those corn
[2:08:44] everything was growing straight straight
[2:08:46] up in the air
[2:08:47] all of them just lifting up their hands
[2:08:49] up to the lord raising their hands
[2:08:51] praising the lord and he said but i
[2:08:53] noticed there was one
[2:08:56] and he says it wasn't straight
[2:08:58] but it was crooked he said down from the
[2:09:00] ground it was it was bent over it was
[2:09:02] crooked it sort of went to the right and
[2:09:05] then it bent back to the left and
[2:09:07] and he said then it bit back over and he
[2:09:09] said he said maybe and i asked why how
[2:09:11] did that happen he says well maybe
[2:09:13] somewhere when that little corn was
[2:09:15] young when it wasn't fully grown when it
[2:09:17] was just a child he says maybe a stick
[2:09:20] or a branch or something fell down upon
[2:09:22] it
[2:09:24] and he says and it calls that
[2:09:26] that crook that that little corn
[2:09:29] to grow up crooked
[2:09:32] now the miracle
[2:09:34] is that it lived
[2:09:38] the miracle
[2:09:40] is that no matter how crooked his life
[2:09:42] was
[2:09:43] no matter how messed up
[2:09:45] no matter what paths he went down in
[2:09:46] life no matter what branch fell upon him
[2:09:49] he didn't ask he didn't ask for that
[2:09:51] branch to fall from that tree
[2:09:53] and to to distort his life and to make
[2:09:55] his life crooked he didn't ask for that
[2:09:57] he was just a child he couldn't do
[2:09:59] anything about it he didn't ask for that
[2:10:00] branch to fall on him
[2:10:04] brother madam says but i noticed he said
[2:10:05] it was crooked as it grew
[2:10:07] but the miracle
[2:10:09] the miracle
[2:10:11] is that it still was living
[2:10:15] you might be here today

[2:18:00] you
[2:18:01] are the one
[2:18:05] i praise
[2:18:09] when you go to the doctor
[2:18:11] brother branham said if you go to the
[2:18:13] doctor listen to what the doctor says
[2:18:14] don't just don't go waste your time
[2:18:18] and the doctors make some
[2:18:19] recommendations
[2:18:22] maybe change your diet maybe do a little
[2:18:24] more exercise maybe get some more rest
[2:18:28] just some things he's telling you to do
[2:18:29] and i think dr jesus has spoken to us
[2:18:31] today
[2:18:32] he said son daughter patient
[2:18:36] there are some things that could help
[2:18:37] you things that would be good for you
[2:18:40] when i went to the doctor and have
[2:18:43] some of the effects of the diabetes and
[2:18:45] the doctor said well you need some
[2:18:46] changes in your life
[2:18:48] these are things you need to do
[2:18:50] and when i do them i feel better
[2:18:53] and when i don't do them i have the same
[2:18:55] results that i had before
[2:18:57] you know
[2:18:59] and and one thing i would say
[2:19:04] god jesus said he said by this shall all
[2:19:07] men know
[2:19:08] you are my disciples
[2:19:09] [Music]
[2:19:10] when you have love one for another
[2:19:15] love covers a multitude of sins
[2:19:18] love makes you compassionate to someone
[2:19:21] else
[2:19:22] love makes you
[2:19:23] walk a mile in their shoes
[2:19:26] like he did for us
[2:19:29] it was knee that was sitting there
[2:19:31] getting ready to come out
[2:19:33] for song service just
[2:19:36] we usually get together and we pray
[2:19:37] first back there and then
[2:19:39] we prepare and i was sitting there and i
[2:19:41] just began to think of what he went
[2:19:42] through on calvary
[2:19:45] love made him do that the willingness to
[2:19:48] take my place so that i could become
[2:19:51] like him
[2:19:54] that same nature
[2:19:56] i just began to cry back there saying
[2:19:58] lord you did it for me

[2:20:02] let us help one another let us pray for
[2:20:05] one another let us encourage one another

[2:20:19] that final change lord may we encourage
[2:20:22] one another may we love one another
