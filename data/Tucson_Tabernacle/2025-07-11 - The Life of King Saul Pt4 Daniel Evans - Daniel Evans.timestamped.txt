[0:03] Amen.
[0:05] Let's say a word. Let's open with a word
[0:08] of prayer. And uh Sister Hope, I'm sorry
[0:10] I I didn't read prayer request from your
[0:13] mom. Um Sister Hope writes that she has
[0:16] a prayer request for healing for her
[0:19] mother, Sister Gloria Puit, and she

[0:31] bless this sister. Father, may she make
[0:34] a full recovery quickly. We ask. And
[0:36] Lord, tonight pray that your hand would
[0:39] be upon us. Lord, the wisdom
[0:43] of the Holy Spirit would guide and
[0:47] direct this service. And help me,
[0:49] Father, as as I open up these script
[0:52] scriptures and this Bible study. I pray
[0:54] that that you'll be with us and guide my
[0:56] words. Father, love you and Lord want it
[1:00] to be for your glory for you are
[1:02] wonderful. We thank you for all you do
[1:05] for us,
[1:07] Lord. A million lifetimes could never
[1:10] say what you do for us. We thank you in
[1:13] Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You can be
[1:16] seated.
[1:18] Is that brother Dennis?
[1:21] You came and you God bless you, brother
[1:23] Dennis McGary, minister of the gospel.
[1:26] Good friend. Bless you. Welcome. Who do
[1:28] we have with you?
[1:30] This is brother Lutus from Romania and
[1:33] his son Chris Lutus.
[1:35] Welcome Romania. God bless you. It's
[1:39] good. It's good to have you.
[1:42] Brother Leen Mution and I have some good
[1:44] friends in Romania. So, it's good to
[1:47] good to see some of the home folks from
[1:49] from that country where there's a whole
[1:50] lot of believers. It's it's good to have
[1:53] you. Thank you for visiting us. On
[1:54] Wednesday night, we have a Bible study
[1:58] and we just we go through books of the
[2:00] Bible or we've been recently we have
[2:03] been going through characters in the
[2:04] Bible. Brother Lyle started our um our
[2:09] study on characters of the Bible with
[2:11] the man Joseph and Joseph's life and we
[2:14] spent a few months on that. Now, brother
[2:17] Lyall and I are going back and forth.
[2:19] Brother Lyall is talking about King
[2:21] David and I have been talking about King
[2:24] Saul and tonight is the next chapter in
[2:28] the life of King Saul. And uh we will be
[2:31] going through basically the book of 1st
[2:34] Samuel chapter 15 tonight talking about
[2:37] this great man of God.
[2:41] Um this this great king that God chose
[2:44] this that uh he gave way to the man that
[2:47] was after God's own heart and that's
[2:49] David. So let's let's get right in to
[2:53] the scriptures. I uh I do. Brother Aaron
[2:57] was supposed to preach tonight and and I
[2:59] know he was prepared and he was ready
[3:03] and then he woke up this morning very
[3:05] sick and and he called me um late
[3:08] morning and said, "Brother brother Dan,
[3:10] I can't do it." And so keep Brother
[3:14] Aaron in your prayers. We want him back
[3:17] at his post of duty. We are incomplete
[3:20] without every one of us. God's program,
[3:24] God's body is built on every single
[3:27] member. And when one member is missing,
[3:30] that body is incomplete and that body is
[3:32] not fully functional. So, we all want to
[3:34] be at our post of duty and we all want
[3:36] to be working for the Lord. So, I put
[3:38] together this quickly. I wasn't planning
[3:41] on ministering tonight, but uh I'm I'm
[3:45] excited. I'm excited. Always excited to
[3:47] read the Bible and open up the word. 1st
[3:50] Samuel
[3:52] chapter 15.
[3:54] And uh we will just go through this
[3:56] chapter and we'll see how far we get.
[3:58] Hopefully we'll get through 15 and maybe
[4:00] 16 and even 17 tonight. We'll we'll see
[4:03] how how it goes. 1st Samuel chapter 15
[4:09] reads like this.
[4:12] Samuel also said unto Saul, before we
[4:17] get going, let let me give a little bit
[4:18] of a background for uh some of the the
[4:21] visitors. We've been going through the
[4:24] uh the book of 1 Samuel and how that God
[4:27] had chosen Saul to be king. The people
[4:29] wanted a king. They saw that Samuel was
[4:32] getting old.
[4:34] Samuel was the last in the book of
[4:37] Judges. He was the last judge and also
[4:40] one of the greatest prophets that has
[4:41] ever lived. And this man Samuel, he
[4:45] he led Israel
[4:48] uh
[4:50] as as a great prophet would with the
[4:54] Lord speaking through him and him
[4:55] guiding. And then the people saw that
[4:58] Samuel started to get old and Samuel's
[5:02] sons were sinners. and they saw that
[5:04] that they didn't want these these
[5:07] offspring to be their leader because
[5:09] they knew that they would fail because
[5:12] of their immoral lives. So they came to
[5:14] Samuel and they said, "Listen, you're
[5:17] getting old and we need someone to lead
[5:22] us. All of these other nations have a
[5:25] king that leads them into battle. We
[5:28] want a king."
[5:31] And it hurt Samuel. It offended Samuel.
[5:33] Samuel was basically like, "Hey, I'm not
[5:35] dead yet. I'm I'm still leading." And
[5:38] and it you can imagine how it offended
[5:40] him. And Samuel went before the Lord.
[5:45] And one thing
[5:48] that that God said to Samuel, he said,
[5:51] "Samuel, they have not forsaken you."
[5:55] Remember that. And maybe I'll get into
[5:58] that this weekend or in the next in the
[6:00] next month or so. Samuel, they have not
[6:02] forsaken you, but they have forsaken me.
[6:07] And he said, give them a king. And we'll
[6:10] read the scripture if if we get that far
[6:13] down. We'll read again where God chose
[6:17] this man, Saul. Saul, the Bible says, he
[6:21] was tall. He was good-looking. and he
[6:25] turned out to be a great warrior and a
[6:30] great leader. He became he was exactly
[6:34] what Israel wanted. They wanted somebody
[6:37] to lead them into battle and this was
[6:39] the man and he did a great job. And we
[6:43] went through the the first part of his
[6:45] reign as king and everything was going
[6:47] well and then things started to go south
[6:50] in his in his kingdom in his reign and
[6:54] he started making bad decisions started
[6:57] making ill-thoughtout decisions. He
[6:59] didn't seek the Lord on certain things.
[7:01] He got hasty and he started making just
[7:05] just poor decisions for the people and
[7:08] ignoring the Lord. And now we come to
[7:11] the final straw as we say. This is the
[7:15] straw that broke the camel's back as it
[7:17] says. This is the final straw in Sam or
[7:21] in Saul's reign. This is when God takes
[7:25] his hand off of King Saul.
[7:28] So 1 Samuel uh chapter 15 verse one,
[7:32] Samuel also said unto Saul, "The Lord
[7:35] sent me to anoint thee to be king over
[7:37] his people, over Israel. Now therefore,
[7:40] hearken unto the voice of the words of
[7:42] the Lord. So Samuel right here, he's
[7:44] establishing himself as a prophet and as
[7:47] a spokesman for God. He tells Saul, "The
[7:50] reason you are king is because God told
[7:53] me to anoint you. Now if you believe
[7:57] that I was led of the Lord to anoint you
[7:59] king, now listen to me, Saul.
[8:04] Thus sayaeth the Lord of hosts." Only a
[8:06] prophet can say that. Thus sayeth the
[8:09] Lord of hosts, I remember that which
[8:12] Amalecch did to Israel, how he laid
[8:15] weight for him in the way when he came
[8:18] up from Egypt. Now go and smite
[8:21] Amalecch. Amalecch is the Amalachites.
[8:24] It's a group of people. All right.
[8:27] Now go and smite Amalecch and utterly
[8:32] destroy all that they have and spare
[8:36] them not. But slay both man and woman,
[8:40] infant and suckling, ox and sheep, and
[8:44] camel and ass. So he's saying sl kill
[8:47] kill everybody.
[8:49] And when when he says everybody, he
[8:51] means sheep and oxes and goats and
[8:55] donkeys, men, women, and children.
[9:00] And he gives very specific instructions.
[9:03] And Samuel is saying, "This isn't me.
[9:06] God is saying this Saul now you do it.
[9:11] It's very important that the prophet he
[9:12] didn't miss me any words. He said thus
[9:15] sayaith the Lord utterly destroy
[9:17] everything that they have. And there are
[9:18] times friends there are times when
[9:20] things seem right
[9:24] and we do what we think is right. And
[9:27] that is that's most of the time for a
[9:29] Christian. When we make a decision,
[9:31] we're doing what we think is right. And
[9:34] this is what seems right to do in a
[9:37] certain situation. You pray about it and
[9:39] you make your best decision based on
[9:41] your revelation of the word of God and
[9:43] your morals and your best judgment.
[9:46] That's that's what we all do most of the
[9:48] time. Most of the time we we really
[9:50] don't get an answer from God. We're
[9:52] trying and we're seeking God. But
[9:56] sometimes
[9:57] you need to make a decision that doesn't
[10:00] line up with your understanding.
[10:03] And remember that
[10:06] it's not always what makes sense to us
[10:11] that God chooses. I remember when I was
[10:15] I don't know 15 years ago or so. I saw a
[10:18] need in the ministry
[10:22] and it was it was a certain amount of
[10:25] money and I I thought, you know what, I
[10:27] can
[10:29] cash out my retirement
[10:31] and I can pay for this this part of the
[10:35] ministry.
[10:37] And I thought, you know, that's right.
[10:38] I'm going to make a sacrifice. And it
[10:40] sounds good, right? It's like, oh, you
[10:42] know, it's you're going to make a
[10:44] sacrifice. I wasn't going to tell
[10:45] anybody. And I was just going to I was
[10:47] going to go into my 401k. I was going to
[10:48] cash everything out and and pay for this
[10:51] certain part. And and I got it in my
[10:54] mind that this was the right thing to do
[10:57] because it sounds right. You know, you
[11:00] make a great sacrifice.
[11:03] And right before
[11:06] I was able to do it, someone came in, a
[11:11] church or or whatever it was came in and
[11:13] they paid for that part of the ministry
[11:15] that needed the money. And now I look
[11:18] back at it and it would have been a
[11:19] terrible mistake
[11:21] for me to do that. That was just me
[11:25] getting worked up about something and
[11:29] wanting to do something right, but
[11:31] really not seeking God in it. And you
[11:34] think, well, brother Daniel, you would
[11:36] have you would have been able to make a
[11:37] great sacrifice, but it wasn't God's
[11:39] will that I would have made that
[11:40] sacrifice. And thank God, he protected
[11:42] me because he knew my heart. And then
[11:44] there was another time when I had the
[11:47] chance to go into the ministry and I was
[11:48] a young man and I was doing really well
[11:51] in my job and Stephanie and I were were
[11:55] making good money. I was in my early 30s
[11:57] and and everything was just going really
[12:01] really good as far as our finances and
[12:04] we were happy and and everything was
[12:06] good. The kids were growing up and it
[12:08] was just a good time to be alive. And
[12:10] then the Lord gave me an opportunity
[12:14] to quit my job and go into the ministry.
[12:18] And I did make that choice after prayer.
[12:22] Put it before the Lord and and the Lord
[12:26] laid it on my heart to give up my career
[12:30] for a fraction of the money that I was
[12:34] making before. And that was the right
[12:36] decision for me to make. And the Lord
[12:40] blessed it. And I believe he's even
[12:42] still blessing it. And it was it was
[12:44] right. So So sometimes it's like what
[12:47] seems right isn't necessarily always
[12:50] what's right. And it may you may get
[12:53] excited and want to do something for the
[12:54] Lord, but you can do the some you can do
[12:56] something for the Lord and it not be his
[12:59] will.
[13:01] So always seek God. And that's what
[13:04] Saul,
[13:07] he wasn't good at doing that. And in
[13:10] this case, Saul actually had an easier
[13:12] decision than most of us had. Samuel
[13:16] came to Saul and specifically told him
[13:19] that God said, "Thus sayeth the Lord."
[13:20] heard. He said, "God said to destroy
[13:23] Amalecch and everyone associated with
[13:26] with that group of people, even the
[13:30] king, kill all the Amalachites and
[13:32] everything associated with them." So,
[13:34] this was specific instruction from God.
[13:37] But that doesn't mean that there wasn't
[13:40] any pressure on King Saul
[13:42] in making the right choice. the sto the
[13:45] choice even though he had heard from God
[13:48] the choice was still his
[13:51] and that's how God has done things from
[13:53] the beginning he gives us an answer
[13:58] and then
[14:00] he lets the questions be asked but it's
[14:04] up to us to make the decision so he
[14:07] shows us here's the right thing to do
[14:10] and then here comes the tempter here
[14:13] comes the problems for the youth, it's
[14:15] like, should I go to that party?
[14:18] Should I hang out with these friends?
[14:22] Is it okay to be intimate with this boy
[14:25] or this girl? And you know the answer.
[14:29] You know what's right? But it's still up
[14:32] to you to make the right decision. And
[14:35] it's easy to make an excuse in your mind
[14:37] why it's okay to do certain things. And
[14:39] for us adults,
[14:41] it's we know or we should know what the
[14:44] Bible says. Every sermon in the New
[14:48] Testament is about Christ, is about
[14:50] Jesus. Every single one. Almost
[14:53] everything in the New Testament either
[14:54] points to morality and living a life
[14:58] that was taught by Christ or it points
[15:00] to the deity of Jesus Christ and
[15:02] salvation through him. And yet we make
[15:05] excuses in our minds why it's okay to
[15:08] preach something different than Christ.
[15:11] We want something other than the Bible,
[15:16] something beyond the Bible. And then we
[15:19] accept those teachings as normal. And
[15:21] people make the conscious decision to go
[15:24] against the Bible and go against the
[15:27] Bible and add to the word. The Book of
[15:30] Mormon, it's called an extension of the
[15:32] Bible.
[15:34] It's another testament of Jesus Christ
[15:37] is what the is what a Mormon says. Morma
[15:39] Jeho Mormons Jehovah Witness with the
[15:41] Jehovah Witness with the Watchtower
[15:43] publications Christian Science
[15:46] and the writings of Mary B Mary Baker
[15:48] Baker Eder I think is her name. Ed,
[15:50] Eddie or Eder Eddie
[15:54] her publications
[15:55] and then they take that, they add to the
[15:59] Bible and it becomes extra biblical,
[16:05] something more
[16:07] than the Bible. And you'll find out that
[16:10] 100% of the time
[16:13] people will concentrate more on what is
[16:17] added
[16:18] rather than the Bible.
[16:22] It's always they want to introduce you
[16:24] to the Book of Mormon. They want to
[16:26] introduce you to the Watchtower. They
[16:28] want to introduce you to these
[16:30] prophecies. They want to introduce you
[16:32] to these things. And they lesson the
[16:35] Bible.
[16:37] And that's we know that the Bible it
[16:41] instructs in certain ways but we make
[16:42] excuses either to plead the please the
[16:45] church or to please our parents or to
[16:47] please our friends or to simply fit in
[16:50] to our society for fit into our
[16:52] surroundings. And this is the mistake
[16:54] that Saul is about to make. He knew the
[16:57] instructions from God but he didn't want
[17:00] to make a stand when Samuel said a thing
[17:04] that was hard to accept.
[17:06] Verse number four. And Saul gathered the
[17:08] people together and numbered them in Tum
[17:11] 200,000 footmen and 10,000 men of Judah.
[17:15] And Saul came to to the to a city of
[17:17] Amalecch and laid weight in the valley.
[17:20] And Saul said unto the Kenites, "Go and
[17:24] depart, get you down from among the
[17:26] Amalachites,
[17:27] lest I destroy you with them, for you
[17:30] showed kindness to all the children of
[17:32] Israel when they came up out of Egypt."
[17:34] So the Kenites departed from among the
[17:36] Amalachites. Brother Lyall and I both
[17:38] have touched on this situation, but this
[17:40] is about Saul. So we're going to we're
[17:41] going to keep focusing on Saul now. And
[17:44] Saul took a
[17:48] king of the Amalachites
[17:50] alive
[17:52] and utterly destroyed all the people
[17:54] with the edge of the sword.
[17:57] So Saul mostly
[18:00] followed the instructions from the Lord,
[18:02] but mostly doesn't count.
[18:05] God throughout the Old Testament and
[18:07] even in the New Testament requires a
[18:09] complete surrender. Even more so in the
[18:12] New Testament than the Old Testament. He
[18:14] requires a complete surrender. Jesus
[18:17] said, "Straight is the gate and narrow
[18:19] is the way and few there will be that
[18:21] find it."
[18:23] It's very easy to just give God God part
[18:28] of your life or even most of your life.
[18:32] It's easy to do that, but he requires
[18:35] all of it. And he required all of Saul.
[18:40] Every bit of them. And here's Saul's big
[18:42] mistake in the pivotal time in his reign
[18:46] as king. Verse number nine. But Saul and
[18:50] the people spared Aag. Remember Aag is
[18:52] the king of the Amalachites.
[18:54] And the best of the sheep and of the
[18:57] oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs
[19:01] and all that was good and would not
[19:04] utterly destroy them. But everything
[19:06] that was vile and refuge they refuse
[19:10] they utterly destroyed. Doesn't that
[19:12] make sense?
[19:14] You start our mind thinking it makes
[19:16] sense. God hates evil and he loves good,
[19:18] right? Why would we destroy all these
[19:21] valuable valuable animals that could be
[19:24] used to feed all the Israelites and feed
[19:26] the poor? The men could take these
[19:29] animals maybe and start their own herds
[19:32] and and be prosperous or and Saul's
[19:36] going to give another excuse. These are
[19:39] nicel lookinging animals. They could be
[19:40] used for something even higher. And I
[19:43] I'll I'll say what those are here in a
[19:44] minute. And King Aag
[19:47] wouldn't want King Aag was he was this
[19:50] king, but wouldn't we want to show
[19:52] mercy? You know, God's full of mercy.
[19:56] So, it might make sense in our mind,
[19:58] let's let's show mercy to this to this
[20:00] man, too. But God had instructed
[20:05] Isaiah
[20:06] said,
[20:09] "For my thoughts are not your thoughts."
[20:12] When the Lord's speaking, he said,
[20:13] "Neither are your ways my ways, sayeth
[20:15] the Lord. For as the heavens are higher
[20:18] than the earth, so are my ways higher
[20:21] than your ways, and my thoughts than
[20:24] your thoughts." So God's not obligated
[20:27] to fit into our image of what God should
[20:30] be.
[20:31] Just because it makes sense, just
[20:34] because it seems right, even just
[20:36] because it feels right, does not make it
[20:39] right.
[20:41] Then came the word of the Lord unto
[20:43] Samuel, saying, It repenteth me that I
[20:47] have set up Saul to be king, for he has
[20:50] turned back from following me, and hath
[20:53] not performed my commandments, and
[20:55] grieve, and it grieved Samuel, and he
[20:58] cried unto the Lord all night.
[21:03] It repented me, God speaking.
[21:08] English Standard Version says, "The word
[21:10] of the Lord came to Samuel.
[21:13] I regret that I have made Saul king, for
[21:17] he has turned back from his from
[21:19] following me and has not performed my
[21:21] commandments." And Samuel was angry and
[21:24] cried to the Lord all night. Then oddly
[21:28] in verse 28 and 29 it says this.
[21:32] And Samuel said to him, 'The Lord has
[21:35] torn the kingdom of Israel from you this
[21:37] day and has given it to a neighbor of
[21:39] yours who is better than you. And also
[21:41] the glory of Israel will not lie or have
[21:45] regret.
[21:48] For he is not a man that he should have
[21:49] regret. And then yet here it's saying
[21:53] that God regrets
[21:55] that he even made Saul king.
[21:59] And then verse 35 it says, "And the Lord
[22:02] regretted that he had made Saul king
[22:05] over Israel."
[22:07] This is my opinion
[22:10] on that.
[22:12] God is not understandable to us. We just
[22:17] read where his ways are not our ways.
[22:19] His thoughts are not our thoughts. His
[22:20] thoughts are higher than our thoughts.
[22:23] And
[22:24] we look to God for mercy and we look to
[22:28] him for guidance. But we don't really
[22:30] look to him to understand him.
[22:33] Understanding God. If we truly
[22:36] understood the way that he was, we would
[22:39] not need any faith.
[22:42] Oh, because we understand it. So there
[22:45] wouldn't be no faith there. And God
[22:49] requires faith. So in in the really
[22:52] God's omnisient
[22:55] he he understand he he knows all things.
[22:58] But then you look at the Bible, you look
[23:00] in the garden of Eden. If he's
[23:01] omnisient,
[23:03] why would he be walking through the
[23:04] garden saying, "Adam, Adam, where are
[23:06] art thou?" Why would he ask Adam, "What
[23:09] have you done? Have you done what I told
[23:11] you not to? Have you eaten of this
[23:12] tree?"
[23:14] Then he already knew the answer.
[23:17] So, we don't understand why the Bible
[23:19] was written. And in the case of Saul,
[23:21] God knew what he was doing, what he was
[23:24] going to become. God knew what Saul was
[23:26] going to become
[23:28] because he said, he told the people, he
[23:30] said, "You're going to regret this.
[23:33] You're going to regret having this guy
[23:35] your king because he's going to take
[23:36] your young man and he's going to be
[23:38] harsh on you." And
[23:40] so then he later on it says that he
[23:44] repents of making Saul king.
[23:47] So when we repent,
[23:50] it's not that we just feel bad. When we
[23:53] repent, we go back to a certain thing
[23:56] that we did and we make it right. So
[23:59] repentance is not just regret. It's
[24:01] doing something about what you did
[24:03] earlier. So saying that God made a bad
[24:07] decision, that's not right. He's He's
[24:08] perfect. He's God.
[24:11] So, what I think it can be best sum
[24:13] summed up in in doing this in in saying
[24:16] that God repented. He went back is that
[24:18] God was disappointed with Saul.
[24:22] And he gave him every opportunity, but
[24:24] Saul continued to make bad decisions.
[24:27] And now God is going to go back to the
[24:30] place where he made Saul king. and he is
[24:34] going to make another man king
[24:37] and move forward from there. So, back to
[24:40] Saul not destroying everything from um
[24:45] the Amalachites including the king.
[24:49] Verse number 12. And when Samuel rose
[24:52] early to meet Saul in the morning, it
[24:54] was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to to
[24:57] Carmel, and behold, he set him up a
[25:00] place, and has gone about and passed on
[25:03] and gone down to Gilgal. And Samuel came
[25:06] to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed
[25:09] be thou of the Lord. I have performed
[25:11] the commandment of the Lord.
[25:14] I've done what you said, Samuel." Yeah,
[25:17] sure you have, Saul.
[25:20] Yeah, you were brave in battle. You
[25:22] destroyed the warriors you were against.
[25:24] Yes, you destroyed all of the e evil
[25:26] people, but you did not do everything
[25:29] that God commanded.
[25:32] But Saul's saying, "Hey, look what I
[25:33] did." And Samuel said, "What meanth then
[25:37] this bleeding of the sheep in mine ears
[25:40] and the loing of the oxen which I hear?"
[25:43] So the prophet comes and he hears all of
[25:46] this livestock and he I told you
[25:50] to kill everything. Why? Why am I
[25:53] hearing all of these sheep and all that?
[25:55] And Samuel said, what meanth this
[25:57] bleeding of the sheep in mine ears and
[26:00] loing of the oxen which I hear? And Saul
[26:02] said, they have brought them from the
[26:04] Amalachites for the people spared the
[26:06] best of the sheep and of the oxen to
[26:09] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God. and and
[26:13] the rest we have utterly destroyed. So
[26:16] he's like, "Oh, it's okay, Samuel. Don't
[26:18] don't worry about it. This was for the
[26:20] Lord. We did this for God. We wanted him
[26:23] to have the best."
[26:25] And again, serving God is not what you
[26:29] think is the best.
[26:31] Serving God is following his word.
[26:35] And we The word, the absolute in our
[26:38] lives is the Bible. No matter what we
[26:40] think, no matter if we don't agree with
[26:41] it, that is God's word. Then Samuel said
[26:46] unto Saul,
[26:48] "Stay, and I will tell thee what the
[26:50] Lord hath said to me this night."
[26:54] And he said unto him, "Say on."
[26:58] Now, there's a transition going on here
[27:02] behind the scenes. Samuel is getting
[27:05] older and he's soon going to die. And
[27:08] Saul is getting more comfortable with
[27:10] his role as king and the authority that
[27:14] comes with it. So much so that there are
[27:17] times, and we'll read here in a little
[27:19] bit, that Samuel is afraid of Saul. He's
[27:23] afraid that Saul is going to kill him.
[27:25] So Saul has a has a weakness of making
[27:29] hasty deci decisions and caving to the
[27:31] desires of the people. And he is also
[27:35] developing really a power trip.
[27:38] Saul's not good with authority. And one
[27:40] of the worst traits he has is only
[27:43] thinking about himself. And to me really
[27:46] all of Saul's faults. Everything that
[27:48] Saul does, you can take it back and it's
[27:51] really it seems like it's driven by
[27:53] fear. He's afraid. He's afraid of losing
[27:56] his position as king. He's afraid of the
[27:58] people. He's afraid of Samuel. and he
[28:01] fears and and he fears that what's going
[28:06] to happen afterwards. And
[28:10] when fear enters in into our lives, in
[28:14] any of us when you start to feel fear,
[28:18] many times you'll act out
[28:21] and in ways that you wouldn't expect.
[28:24] Maril Lee's got this I hope she she's
[28:27] probably listening. She's she's got this
[28:29] dog and this little thing is
[28:34] sometimes it's afraid of people. And
[28:38] when that thing's afraid of you, it'll
[28:39] go and bark and and and just make all
[28:42] kinds of noise and it'll run outside and
[28:44] just it'll just not be a good dog. But
[28:46] when it's not afraid of you, boy, it'll
[28:48] jump up in your lap and and love on you
[28:51] and and just be a really a sweet animal.
[28:53] And then there's other dogs that when
[28:55] they're afraid of you, they're going to
[28:56] lash out and they're going to bite you.
[28:59] And it's really fear. The dog doesn't
[29:01] want to eat you. It's afraid of you. And
[29:04] it's def it feels like it's defending
[29:07] itself. And that's how this Saul is.
[29:09] He's he's really overcome with fear. And
[29:12] Samuel said, "When thou was little in
[29:15] thine own sight, was thou not made the
[29:18] head of the tribes of Israel? And the
[29:21] Lord anointed thee king over Israel?" He
[29:24] says, "When you were little in your own
[29:28] sight." Very key word there. The key
[29:30] word is were. When you were little,
[29:35] meaning you're not anymore.
[29:38] It means that that's in the past. So
[29:40] when God made him king, Saul was great
[29:42] and he did a great job. But things are
[29:44] rapidly changing in Saul's life. And we
[29:48] see friends, we see that this is
[29:51] manifested not just in Saul, but it's
[29:54] manifested all over the place. I've
[29:59] heard I'm gonna
[30:02] preach for a minute. I've I've heard
[30:05] people tell me that, you know, when this
[30:09] church started, everything was really
[30:12] good. People were coming to the altar
[30:14] and we had new converts and we were
[30:16] baptizing new people and then things
[30:19] started to change and it was because
[30:23] they got there was more confidence.
[30:25] There was there was more reliance on the
[30:27] church or reliance on the pastor,
[30:28] reliant on the leader rather than
[30:31] relying on God. Remember the book of
[30:32] Judges and and things start out really
[30:36] good, but then they start to fail later
[30:39] on because we're not humble in our own
[30:41] eyes. You start with look at Martin
[30:44] Luther. Martin Luther was wonderful.
[30:46] Martin Luther did great things. And then
[30:49] after Martin Luther, they started to
[30:51] form this Lutheran organization to where
[30:54] we are the elite and their what happened
[30:56] was their humility started to die and it
[31:00] got replaced with their love for their
[31:03] doctrines and then they started cutting
[31:05] people out and saying we the Lutheran
[31:08] are the great ones.
[31:11] Same thing with John Wesley. John and
[31:14] Charles Wesley were wonderful people.
[31:16] They they did incredible things in
[31:18] England and and going around and and
[31:20] winning souls and and converting people
[31:22] into into Christianity and out of
[31:24] Catholicism and out of heathenism and
[31:27] and things were just going really really
[31:30] good. They had a methodical approach to
[31:33] the gospel and it worked very good for
[31:36] that time.
[31:38] And then as times changed they said now
[31:42] we are the elite and their humility that
[31:44] was once there. Their humility leaves
[31:47] and then they start saying here's how
[31:49] you have to do your work. Here's the
[31:51] doctrine that you have to have to be.
[31:53] You have to be a Methodist
[31:56] to be really a child of God
[32:01] and the Lord leaves.
[32:04] William Seymour, the Pentecostal Church
[32:06] in the early 1900s,
[32:09] tremendous
[32:12] great gifts and healings and and great
[32:14] things went around the world
[32:18] and they they they were they they would
[32:21] pray all night and they were meeting all
[32:23] all hours of 24 hours a day. They were
[32:25] having services there at Isuza Street.
[32:28] People would come in from all over the
[32:30] world and they would speak in tongues
[32:31] and they would receive the Holy Spirit.
[32:33] And then it started the humility started
[32:36] to leave and it started to be replaced
[32:39] with these doctrines that you have to
[32:42] speak in tongues to have truly have the
[32:44] Holy Spirit. And as times changed, they
[32:48] said, "No, you can't move on. You have
[32:50] to have this. This is the way. We are
[32:53] the elite. We are the Pentecostals.
[32:58] And then God just leaves it because the
[33:02] humility was gone.
[33:04] And that's exactly what happens to Saul
[33:07] here.
[33:09] He
[33:11] loses his humility.
[33:15] Verse number 17 again. And Samuel said,
[33:18] "When thou was little in thine own
[33:20] sight,
[33:22] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[33:25] of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee
[33:27] king over Israel?"
[33:30] And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and
[33:32] said, "Go and utterly destroy the
[33:34] sinners, the Amalachites,
[33:37] and
[33:38] and fight against them until they be
[33:42] consumed." Wherefore then didest thou
[33:46] not obey the voice of the Lord, but
[33:48] didest fly upon the spoil, and didest
[33:51] evil in the sight of the Lord? He's
[33:54] saying here, so so Saul is going to pass
[33:57] the blame, but he's Samuel here is
[33:58] saying, "No, you did it, Saul." He's
[34:01] saying, "You're the one responsible. You
[34:04] wanted the money. You were responsible
[34:06] for the livestock." And Saul said unto
[34:09] Samuel, "Yeah, I've obeyed the voice of
[34:11] the Lord." Look at now he's feeling more
[34:15] bold. Yay. I have obeyed the voice of
[34:18] the Lord and have gone the way which the
[34:20] Lord sent me and have brought Aag, the
[34:22] king of the king of Amalecch, and have
[34:24] utterly destroyed all the Amalachites.
[34:27] There's a tr transition taking place in
[34:30] this man. And he's saying here, what I
[34:34] did, I did what I was supposed to do. It
[34:36] wasn't my fault.
[34:39] But the people,
[34:41] Saul still speaking, but the people took
[34:43] of the spoil,
[34:46] the sheep, and the oxen, the chief of
[34:48] the things which which should have been
[34:50] utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the
[34:53] Lord thy God in Gilgal. He's saying,
[34:57] Samuel, they took the the stuff, they
[35:00] took the the livestock
[35:03] to sacrifice to your God.
[35:09] And Samuel said, "Hath the Lord as great
[35:14] delight in burnt offerings and
[35:16] sacrifices?" This
[35:19] is one of those Bible verses.
[35:22] This is one to commit to memory. This is
[35:26] one that is one of those just gems in
[35:30] the Bible. They're all gems. It's all
[35:32] the word of God. But this is one that is
[35:35] really a good one to remember.
[35:38] And Samuel said, "Hath the Lord as great
[35:43] delight in burnt offerings and
[35:45] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[35:48] the Lord?
[35:50] Behold, it is better to o to obey is
[35:54] better than sacrifice,
[35:57] and to hearken better than the fat of
[36:00] rams."
[36:01] To obey
[36:03] is better than sacrifice. And to listen
[36:07] to God more than all the sacrifices that
[36:10] you can make.
[36:13] For rebellion
[36:15] is as the sin of witchcraft, and
[36:17] stubbornness is as iniquity and
[36:20] idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the
[36:22] word of the Lord, he hath also rejected
[36:25] thee from being king.
[36:28] Wow.
[36:30] The New Living Translation says, "What
[36:32] is more pleasing to the Lord, your burnt
[36:34] offerings and sacrifices or your
[36:36] obedience to his voice?" Listen,
[36:39] obedience is better than sacrifice. And
[36:42] submission is better than offering the
[36:43] fat of rams. Rebellion is as sinful as
[36:47] witchcraft.
[36:48] Wow.
[36:51] And stubbornness is as bad as worshiping
[36:54] idols.
[36:55] So because you have rejected the command
[36:57] of the Lord, he has rejected you as
[36:59] king.
[37:01] Verse number 24.
[37:04] That hit him hard.
[37:08] And Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned,
[37:11] for I have transgressed the commandment
[37:14] of the Lord and thy words because I
[37:17] feared the people and obeyed their
[37:20] voice." Now he's being honest. He's
[37:22] saying, "I was afraid.
[37:24] That's the reason I did these things.
[37:26] And how many sins
[37:29] really, as I was saying before, are a
[37:31] result of fear? People lash out because
[37:33] they're fear someone's talking about
[37:35] them. People lash out because they're
[37:38] afraid of losing their position in
[37:39] church. Pastors attack the people in
[37:43] their church because they are afraid.
[37:46] Dictators,
[37:48] they kill their rivals because they're
[37:50] afraid their rivals might replace them.
[37:54] Democrats are afraid of Republicans
[37:56] being in power, so they spread these
[37:59] crazy lies about them wanting to kill
[38:01] minorities or prevent certain
[38:03] demographics from having medicine. And
[38:06] it goes on and on. And Republicans do
[38:08] the same, which is not as bad.
[38:14] Let's go back.
[38:16] Let's go back to uh Saul pleading with
[38:19] Samuel.
[38:21] Now therefore I pray thee, pardon my sin
[38:25] and turn again with me that I may
[38:28] worship the Lord.
[38:31] Now
[38:32] friends, sometimes God requires us to
[38:36] separate from someone who is a bad
[38:38] influence in our lives.
[38:41] And Samuel here
[38:43] is separating himself from Saul.
[38:48] And Samuel and as Samuel turned about to
[38:50] go away,
[38:51] he laid Saul laid upon laid hold upon
[38:54] the skirt of his mantle and rented. So
[38:57] Samuel turns or Samuel turns to go and
[39:00] Saul tried to hold him back and tore the
[39:03] hem of his robe.
[39:05] And Samuel said unto him, "The Lord hath
[39:08] rent the kingdom of Israel from thee
[39:10] this day, and hath given it to a
[39:12] neighbor of thine
[39:14] who is better than thou.
[39:17] Ouch, that was hard. He's saying, Saul,
[39:22] the Lord has given the kingdom
[39:25] to someone who is better than you.
[39:30] So, who is the prophet speaking about?
[39:33] We know who
[39:36] David.
[39:39] And also the strength of Israel will not
[39:42] lie nor repent for he is not a man that
[39:46] he should repent. And you notice the
[39:49] capitalization in the King James that
[39:52] it's talking about the Lord there
[39:54] speaking of God, the strength of Israel.
[39:58] Then he said, then Saul said, 'I have
[40:01] sinned, yet honor me now, I pray thee,
[40:04] before the elders of my people and
[40:06] before Israel, and turn again with me
[40:09] that I may worship the Lord." So Samuel
[40:12] turned again after Saul, and Saul
[40:14] worshiped the Lord. So we see a
[40:16] tenderness here in Samuel
[40:19] at Saul's repentance. But I think Samuel
[40:23] knew that Saul's repentance
[40:26] was just going to be short-lived.
[40:30] And it was a repentance really because
[40:33] he got caught.
[40:35] And how many of us and how many do we
[40:38] see when someone really repents,
[40:42] but they're repenting just just because
[40:44] they got caught?
[40:46] But then there's a repentance, friends,
[40:48] that when we repent, say, 'Lord, I did
[40:51] wrong. And you come before him and you
[40:53] you confess, not that you got caught,
[40:56] but that you're just really laying it
[40:58] out there. But here, Saul's just
[41:01] repenting because he got caught. And
[41:03] Samuel sees that.
[41:06] And it's really most likely the case
[41:09] that it was just a an insincere
[41:12] repentance. But there's one thing left.
[41:14] Remember all the instructions that
[41:17] Samuel had given to Saul.
[41:20] He didn't kill the king.
[41:26] And then said Samuel, "Bring ye hither
[41:29] to me Aag the king of the Amalachites."
[41:33] And Aag came to him delicately. And Aag
[41:37] said, "Surely the bitterness of death
[41:40] has passed." So it came to him
[41:43] delicately. Yeah, I I'll I'll bet he did
[41:47] come to Samuel. He's like, "Hey, Sam."
[41:51] You know, you're not mad anymore, right?
[41:54] We lost the battle.
[41:56] And he's like, "Hey, the the wrath has
[41:59] passed, right?"
[42:02] No.
[42:04] And Samuel said, now Samuel is a
[42:06] prophet. He's doing exactly what God had
[42:09] instructed. And Samuel said, "As thy
[42:11] sword has hath made women childless, so
[42:14] shall thy mother be childless among
[42:16] women." And Samuel hewed a gag into
[42:19] pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
[42:24] Then Samuel went to Rama, and Saul went
[42:27] up to his house in Gibia of Saul. And
[42:31] Samuel came no more to see Saul
[42:36] until the day of his death.
[42:38] He's separated from this bad influence
[42:43] and he knew that God wasn't with this
[42:44] man. So Samuel wanted to be away from a
[42:49] man that that was really God had
[42:52] separated himself from and he was going
[42:54] down the wrong road. We can't always
[42:56] friends we can't always save someone
[42:59] that is passing that is going down the
[43:01] wrong direction. We always want to we
[43:04] always want to jump in and and take care
[43:06] of them. But there is a time when when
[43:08] no we are not strong enough to go to go
[43:13] with that person and we need to separate
[43:17] ourselves from unbelief also. There's a
[43:20] time for that. There's a time to put
[43:21] your hand in the fire as Jude said and
[43:24] then there's a time as this is saying
[43:25] here that Samuel separated himself from
[43:28] Saul.
[43:31] So we will um
[43:39] and Samuel came no more to see Saul
[43:41] until the day of his death. And
[43:43] nevertheless, Samuel mourned for Saul.
[43:45] And the Lord repented that he had made
[43:48] Saul king over Israel. So the Lord
[43:51] regretted that he made Saul king. And I
[43:53] really believe that this was because
[43:57] that he was just very disappointed in
[43:59] this man Saul. So we'll close and uh let
[44:03] me summarize the next few chapters.
[44:06] Remember Samuel had said that God had
[44:08] chosen someone better to be king. We
[44:10] know that was David. So in chapter 16,
[44:12] David's anointed king. Let me uh let me
[44:15] read uh chapter 16 verse one because one
[44:19] and two because I think it's important.
[44:21] says this uh 1st Samuel 16:1,
[44:26] "And the Lord said unto Samuel,
[44:29] how long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
[44:31] seeing I have rejected him from reigning
[44:33] over Israel? Fill thine horn with oil,
[44:36] and go, and I will send thee to Jesse
[44:39] the Bethleamite, for I have provided me
[44:43] a king among his sons."
[44:46] Now look at the difference right here in
[44:49] what God says when he had anointed um
[44:53] Saul king in 1st Samuel 9. It says this.
[44:56] Now the Lord had told Samuel in his year
[44:58] talking about Saul now. Now the Lord had
[45:01] told Samuel in his ear the day before
[45:03] Saul came, saying, "Tomorrow about this
[45:05] time, I will send you a man from the
[45:08] land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint
[45:10] him commander over my people Israel,
[45:12] that he may save my people from the hand
[45:14] of the Philistines, for I have looked
[45:17] upon my people because their cry has
[45:19] come to me." So he's saying that I'm
[45:20] going to send this man, and he's going
[45:22] to save the people from the Philistines.
[45:23] He's going to be a great warrior. Now,
[45:25] look what he says about David. He
[45:27] says,"For I have provided me a king."
[45:32] Look at the difference. A man after
[45:34] God's own heart, this man David, "I have
[45:37] provided me a king among his sons." And
[45:41] Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hear
[45:44] it, he will kill me, and the Lord will
[45:47] take a hepher with thee and say, I am
[45:50] come to Well, I'm sorry. And and he will
[45:54] kill me. And the Lord said, "Take a heer
[45:55] with thee and say, I am come to
[45:58] sacrifice to the Lord." So here we see
[46:01] that even Samuel now is afraid of Saul.
[46:04] And he fears for his life. So Samuel
[46:06] knows that something is off with this
[46:09] man. So the Lord sends Samuel to Jesse.
[46:12] He chooses one of his sons. Samuel
[46:15] doesn't know which of Jesse's eight sons
[46:17] uh that's going to be king. And the Lord
[46:19] says uh this this is important, too. The
[46:23] Lord says this
[46:25] when um he's looking for someone
[46:30] that's going to be tall and good-looking
[46:33] and a great warrior like David was or
[46:35] like Saul was. So here Samuel goes and
[46:39] he's going to these these sons of Jesse
[46:42] and he's looking for somebody like Saul.
[46:44] Now look at the difference.
[46:48] He uh
[46:51] the king, it says this in verse seven,
[46:54] but the Lord said unto Samuel,
[46:57] "Look not on his countenance or on his
[47:00] height, of his stature, because I have
[47:02] refused him. For the Lord Lord seeth not
[47:05] as a man seeth, for man lookketh on the
[47:08] outward appearance, but the Lord lookth
[47:10] on the heart."
[47:13] So this king is not going to be like the
[47:15] last one.
[47:17] The first king was the most kingly
[47:19] looking one and the obvious choice. But
[47:21] this one, this choice
[47:25] was the choice of God. Choice of God's
[47:28] heart and a man after God's own heart.
[47:31] About this time, we see an evil spirit
[47:35] enter into Saul. David is chosen to play
[47:39] the harp for Saul because it makes him
[47:41] feel better. And and it worked. David
[47:45] comes in and he uses his talents to
[47:47] really set the mood. And even in verse
[47:50] 21, it says that Saul loved David
[47:53] greatly.
[47:54] And then David became Saul's armor
[47:57] bearer. In chapter 17, the m the uh
[48:00] worship team can come. Chapter 17, David
[48:04] and Goliath. David was just a boy and
[48:07] Saul was really the most powerful and
[48:09] capable person in the entire country.
[48:14] And it's really amazing that Saul was a
[48:18] masterful leader and a masterful
[48:20] general. But when he saw Goliath
[48:23] and when he saw the Philistines over on
[48:26] the other side,
[48:28] Saul knew saying, "We don't want to
[48:30] fight that battle because we'll lose."
[48:34] But then David comes.
[48:36] Saul was looking at the flesh and Saul
[48:39] was looking at if he could win a
[48:41] physical battle. But David in his youth
[48:45] was trusting in God.
[48:48] And David cries out. He says, "Who is
[48:51] this uncircumcised Philistine that he
[48:54] should defy the armies of the living
[48:55] God?" David already as a young man was
[48:58] demonstrating the power of faith.
[49:01] Something that Saul even then we see
[49:04] that he was lacking. Even though God was
[49:07] with Israel,
[49:09] David was taking God at his word. And
[49:12] Saul was more reliant on his armies and
[49:16] his abilities. So we see Saul is
[49:19] starting now to go down this road and he
[49:22] never really turns back here. And I
[49:25] think that I'll probably in the next
[49:27] time that I teach on Saul. I think we'll
[49:31] wrap up Saul's life. But this was the
[49:34] final straw that when he didn't do what
[49:39] God said and he left all the animals,
[49:42] didn't kill the king is when God really
[49:44] just took his hand off of Saul and then
[49:48] an evil spirit that come that came from
[49:49] God. The Bible says comes in and starts
[49:53] tormenting Saul and his life really is
[49:57] miserable and it's from then on it's
[49:59] just dominated by fear.
[50:02] Saul,
[50:04] another one of the chapters.
