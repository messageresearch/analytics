[0:00] I can't [singing and music]
[0:01] even walk without you holding [singing]
[0:06] my hand.
[0:08] [music] And the mountains
[0:10] too high
[0:12] and the [music] valleys
[0:15] too high.
[0:17] Oh, down [singing]
[0:18] on my [music] knees.
[0:21] That's where I learn to stand. Cuz Lord,
[0:26] I can't [music] even walk without you
[0:30] holding my hand. [music]
[0:34] And I thought no
[0:39] would surely
[0:41] be me.
[0:43] I thought I could be
[0:47] what I [music and singing] wanted
[0:49] to be.
[0:51] And I thought I could
[0:56] laugh seeking [music]
[0:58] sand. But Lord, I can't even walk
[1:04] without [music and singing] you holding
[1:06] my hand. Oh Lord, I [music] can't even
[1:11] walk without you holding
[1:15] my hand.
[1:17] The [music] mountains [singing]
[1:20] too high.
[1:22] In the valley [music]
[1:26] [singing] down on my knees,
[1:30] that's where [music and singing] I learn
[1:33] to sing. Cuz Lord, I can't take and walk
[1:38] without [music]
[1:39] you holding [singing] my hand.
[1:43] [music]
[1:45] And I thought I had
[1:50] a [music] lot [singing] on my own.
[1:54] And I thought I can make it
[1:58] all
[2:02] and I follow
[2:04] myself
[2:06] as a mighty
[2:09] man. But I can't [music] even walk
[2:14] without you holding my hand. Oh Lord, I
[2:19] [music] can't even walk without you
[2:24] holding
[2:25] my hand.
[2:27] And the mountains [music and singing]
[2:30] to high
[2:32] and the valley
[2:34] to
[2:36] [music and singing] down on my knees.
[2:40] That's where [music and singing] I learn
[2:43] to stand. Cuz Lord, I can't even walk
[2:48] without you holding [music] my hand.
[2:54] And I think I'll make Jesus
[2:59] my [singing] all
[3:01] in all. [music]
[3:03] If you found
[3:05] trouble
[3:07] on his name,
[3:11] if I
[3:14] trust you, I'd be [music] less [singing]
[3:16] of a man. Cuz Lord, I can't even [music]
[3:22] walk without [singing]
[3:24] you holding my hand. Cuz Lord, I can't
[3:29] even [music] walk without [singing]
[3:32] you holding
[3:35] my hand.
[3:37] The mountains [music]
[3:39] to high
[3:41] in the valleys
[3:43] to
[3:45] down on my knees. [music]
[3:49] That's where I [singing] learn to sleep.
[3:53] Cuz Lord, I can't take it home.
[3:57] without [music]
[3:58] you.
[4:02] [music]
[4:02] God bless you all. I stand
[4:12] when he moves among us.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:17] &gt;&gt; All that [singing] he does
[4:20] and all of his mercy
[4:24] and all of [music and singing] his love.

[10:08] It's good to see you in the house of the
[10:10] Lord this evening. Tell you what, if you
[10:12] couldn't tell, I was through the moon
[10:15] this morning after that sermon. I just,
[10:17] it really, really did a lot for me. I
[10:20] don't have any prayer requests, but you
[10:22] have any prayer requests? Um, didn't see
[10:25] any back there.
[10:27] Friends, God is real.
[10:31] He's been answering prayer
[10:34] &gt;&gt; from the very beginning
[10:36] &gt;&gt; and he still answers prayer for healing,
[10:40] for deliverance, for reconciliation.
[10:43] Every need that we have, we can bring
[10:47] before him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:50] and he'll answer. Do you have a request
[10:53] on your heart? Is there something before
[10:54] you raise your hand, think about it, is
[10:58] there something that you want that you
[11:01] need that you would like to approach the
[11:04] Lord Jesus on and say, "Lord, here's my
[11:07] request. Here's what I need." You have
[11:09] something? Just raise your hand.
[11:13] Our Father,
[11:17] Lord, we're so grateful that there is an
[11:19] almighty God in heaven.
[11:22] that there is
[11:24] Lord there's just that there's goodness
[11:27] in this world today and all things that
[11:30] are good come from you
[11:33] Lord we are so grateful that we can
[11:34] [music] go before you in prayer
[11:38] Lord there are hands that were lifted
[11:43] and Father we don't just take these
[11:46] things lightly when we raise our hand
[11:49] we're raising our hand to the Lord Jesus
[11:51] Christ.
[11:53] Lord, these hands were raised.
[11:56] We pray that
[11:58] Lord, you heard, you saw these requests
[12:01] and that you would grant each one, Lord.
[12:05] And then, Father, we want to just give
[12:07] you a testimony from it. We want to give
[12:09] you honor and praise.
[12:12] Say thank you. Thank you for being God.
[12:15] Thank you for being my savior. Thank you
[12:18] for being my Lord. Here I am in this
[12:21] world and I have a Lord that knows my
[12:25] needs and is willing to answer. Lord, we
[12:27] thank you. I place them into your hands
[12:30] and this service into your hands in
[12:33] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[12:37] You may be seated.
[12:41] We have a special blessing tonight.
[12:43] Brother Joel is going to preach for us
[12:45] and he's going to sing us an original
[12:47] song of his. He has in Canada named
[12:51] Blameless. I look forward to hearing
[13:25] Amen. God bless you tonight.
[13:28] This song is an original. It's a song I
[13:29] wrote
[13:31] long, long time ago. And this is
[13:35] my story. And it might be your story,
[13:37] too. It's the story of the protocol.
[13:39] It's called Back Home.
[13:46] I feel so unworthy
[13:50] as I walk along the road. [singing]
[13:55] Oh,
[13:59] and as I raise my head,
[14:03] look into the horizon,
[14:07] I see my father's house.
[14:12] I'm coming back home. [singing]
[14:15] I've been fooled and I went away, but
[14:18] now I'm coming back home. [singing]
[14:22] I'm coming back to stay. I wonder, will
[14:25] you take me back?
[14:28] Even with all I've done,
[14:33] you [music] feel so sad
[14:36] since your son left home.
[14:41] Oh,
[14:46] and every night you pray,
[14:50] hoping [music] he will soon be home.
[14:52] [singing]
[14:55] Oh,
[14:59] and as you're looking through the
[15:01] window, see someone walking by the house
[15:05] [music] looking like your son.
[15:11] Cuz I'm coming back home.
[15:14] [music and singing]
[15:15] I've been fooled and I went away, but
[15:18] now I'm coming back home.
[15:22] And I'm coming back [music] to stay. I
[15:25] wonder would you take me back?
[15:28] Even with all I've done, Lord, I wonder
[15:32] would you take [music] me back?
[15:35] Even with all I've done,
[15:39] my father's running to me. He threw his
[15:43] arms around me. Father, I have sinned
[15:48] against heaven and against you. I am no
[15:53] [singing] longer worthy to be called
[15:56] your son,
[15:58] but I'm coming back home. [singing]
[16:02] Whoa.
[16:05] I'm coming back home.
[16:09] I'm coming back to [music and singing]
[16:10] stay. I wonder would you take me back
[16:15] even with all I've done? [singing]
[16:19] Let's have a feast and celebrate.
[16:22] He said
[16:26] for the son of mine was lost and now
[16:29] he's found. [singing]
[16:32] He came back home.

[28:58] people in the balcony.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I [snorts]
[29:03] will build my church."
[29:05] &gt;&gt; And I believe this church has got in a
[29:07] state where it's ready to receive the
[29:10] sick and afflicted.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; And uh and God will send them. He still
[29:16] calls. He calls. If uh if nobody comes
[29:21] to a church, it's not God's fault. He's
[29:24] still calling.
[29:26] is the church is not ready to receive
[29:28] the people and that's why nobody is
[29:31] coming because God won't send his people
[29:34] to see them die in a church somewhere.
[29:38] He wants to see them in a church where
[29:42] they will get in a personal relationship
[29:44] with him
[29:46] &gt;&gt; where they will cross through that open
[29:48] door. He said I am the door and where
[29:51] they will enter into Christ the promised
[29:53] land. Amen.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to keep you up uh too
[29:58] long. Let's just turn to our Bibles
[30:00] tonight. We we'll read a fair share of
[30:02] Numbers 13 as we go back to the story of
[30:06] the children of Israel tonight.
[30:09] And I hope you are blessed this morning
[30:12] if you were here.
[30:14] This morning we talked about Moses
[30:16] journey,
[30:18] his first run, his his first uh his
[30:22] first time leaving Egypt and uh
[30:26] we might have thought of it as an
[30:28] exodus, but it was in fact an exile. He
[30:32] ran to the church in Median.
[30:34] Amen. If you haven't heard it, you
[30:36] should go back and watch it. Now verse
[30:39] 13,
[30:40] starting from verse one.
[30:46] And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
[30:49] "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan,
[30:52] which I am giving to the children of
[30:56] Israel."
[30:57] This is very important to remember. Send
[31:00] spies to spy the land that I am giving
[31:05] the children of Israel. There's no maybe
[31:08] here. From each tribe
[31:12] of their fathers, you shall send a man,
[31:15] everyone a leader among them. Now, we
[31:18] will skip a few verses because there's
[31:20] the name of all the tribes and the
[31:21] leaders. And we will go to verse 17.
[31:26] Then Moses sent them to spy out the land
[31:29] of Canaan Canaan and said to them, "Go
[31:33] up this way into the south and go up to
[31:36] the mountains and see what the land is
[31:39] like, whether the people who dwell in it
[31:41] are strong or weak, few or many, whether
[31:44] the land they dwell in is good or bad,
[31:47] whether the cities they inhabit are like
[31:50] camps or strongholds, whether the land
[31:53] is rich or poor, and whether there are
[31:54] forests or there are up. Be of good
[31:57] courage and bring home the fruits of the
[31:59] land. Now the time was the season of the
[32:03] first ripe grapes.
[32:05] So they went
[32:07] and spied out the land from the
[32:09] wilderness of Zin as far as Rehab near
[32:12] the entrance of Hamat. And they went up
[32:15] through the south and came to Ibron,
[32:17] Haiman, Shishi, and Telmi. The
[32:20] descendants of Anak were there. Now
[32:23] Hebron was built seven years before Zan
[32:25] in Egypt. Then they came to the valley
[32:29] of Ishkol where and there cut down a
[32:33] branch with one cluster of grape. They
[32:35] carried it between two of them on a
[32:38] pole. They also brought some of the palm
[32:41] grenade and figs.
[32:44] The place was called the valley of Ishko
[32:47] because the cluster which the men of
[32:49] Israel cut down there. and they returned
[32:52] from spying out the land after 40 days.
[32:56] Now they departed and came back to Moses
[32:58] and Aaron
[33:01] and all the congregation of the children
[33:03] of Israel in the wilderness of Pon at
[33:07] Kadesh and they brought back word to
[33:10] them and to all the congregation and
[33:12] showed them the fruit of the land.
[33:16] Amen. You may be seated.
[33:19] Tonight, I hope you can bear with my for
[33:22] English. It's It's even worse when I
[33:23] read because I don't get to choose the
[33:26] words, you know, when I speak, at least
[33:28] I can choose the words I use.
[33:31] So, I thank you for bearing with me and
[33:34] my French accent. May God bless you.
[33:37] Amen. Like I told you this morning, it's
[33:39] a little bit like a two-part series uh
[33:44] a minieries
[33:46] on the children of Israel and their
[33:48] journey. And my title for tonight's
[33:51] sermon is
[33:54] waiting on the Lord for the fulfillment
[33:57] of the promise.
[33:59] Waiting on the Lord for the fulfillment
[34:01] of the promise.
[34:03] And uh we turn our eyes to the children
[34:05] of Israel tonight and and you know they
[34:09] had seen so many miracles
[34:12] up to the passage we've just read where
[34:15] they're now you know they're not at the
[34:17] door just on the shores of the promised
[34:21] land. They've seen God do so many
[34:23] miracles. They've seen the plagues, the
[34:26] the 10 plagues of Egypt, you know, the
[34:29] the the water turned to blood and and
[34:32] the bugs and the frogs and everything.
[34:35] And then they walked out of Egypt and
[34:38] and the the Red Sea was parted and not
[34:41] only did the Red Sea open so they could
[34:43] cross, but it it went back over their
[34:46] enemy to destroy them. And then they ate
[34:49] the mano and they drank the water from
[34:52] the rock and they heard God speaking
[34:54] from the mountain. I mean all these
[34:57] things they had experienced all these
[35:00] miracles and wonders they weren't think
[35:04] God promised them.
[35:08] They had no promise for these things.
[35:10] There was no promise for mana. But mana
[35:13] was working hand inhand with the
[35:16] promise.
[35:18] They had a promise. The promise they had
[35:21] was the children of Israel will dwell in
[35:25] a foreign land for 400 years. But I will
[35:27] bring them out with my mighty hand and I
[35:31] will give them the promised land flowing
[35:33] with milk and honey. That was the
[35:36] promise. But the water and the mana and
[35:39] the parting of the Red Sea, there was no
[35:42] promise talking about these things, but
[35:45] they were steps into the fulfillment of
[35:49] that promise.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; You with me? And after all they
[35:53] experienced,
[35:55] after all of these miracles and wonders,
[35:59] God says, "I give you the land.
[36:04] send one leader from each tribe to
[36:07] inspect the land to see whether there's
[36:10] fruits and whether it's good and and
[36:13] what the inhabitants look like. Go and
[36:16] inspect the land I have given you, the
[36:20] promised land.
[36:22] That's what is asked of them,
[36:25] not to see if they can take the land or
[36:28] not. It's asked of them to see what the
[36:31] land is like.
[36:35] the land I have given you. So these men
[36:39] went on a 40-day expedition.
[36:43] And they came back with proof of the
[36:47] promised land.
[36:49] Throughout all of the children of
[36:52] Israel's journey, they had no proof of
[36:55] the promised land. They had none. But
[36:59] for the first time in their existence,
[37:04] they have something the promise spoke
[37:07] about. When the spies came back
[37:12] from inspecting the prom the the land,
[37:16] they told him and said, "We went to the
[37:19] land where you sent us. It truly flows
[37:23] with milk and honey."
[37:26] This was the promise.
[37:29] They come back from a land with the
[37:31] evidence of the promise. They say it
[37:35] flows with milk and honey. And here are
[37:36] the fruits of the land.
[37:39] For the first time of their journey,
[37:41] they have proof. They have evidence of
[37:46] the promise. They should rejoice.
[37:48] No.
[37:50] Shouldn't they rejoice that they finally
[37:52] near a land where flows milk and honey?
[37:58] They didn't
[38:01] they didn't rejoice. You know why?
[38:06] Because they are human beings. They were
[38:10] they were human beings
[38:13] shaped in iniquity, formed in sin, came
[38:15] to the world telling lies.
[38:18] And that is the one thing we have in
[38:20] common with them. We are humans also.
[38:25] So the story
[38:28] we talk about tonight is a story about
[38:31] us. Like I mentioned this morning, we
[38:34] cannot read our Bible 20,000 ft high and
[38:39] just, you know, see the big uh the big
[38:41] picture of the stories. These types are
[38:45] there so we can identify with them. So
[38:48] we can see the state of our lives.
[38:52] And so when I preach, I always tell the
[38:55] people, you should bring a mirror
[38:58] because it's easy to put it on someone
[39:00] else. Amen for brother so and so or he
[39:03] said this because of that or whatever
[39:05] that might be. But we should have the
[39:07] humility when we come in the house of
[39:09] God. Judgment starts in the house of
[39:11] God. Correction starts in the house of
[39:13] God. We should have the humility to come
[39:15] with a mirror and say, "What about me?
[39:19] &gt;&gt; What about me tonight?" This is how we
[39:21] can grow in our walk with the Lord. And
[39:25] um and so,
[39:27] you know, I'm saying all this because
[39:30] someone is sitting in the room tonight
[39:34] and has seen milk and honey
[39:38] in their life.
[39:40] Someone is sitting in church tonight and
[39:42] has seen the fruit of the promise in
[39:45] their situation.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; But still give a negative report of the
[39:51] situation.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Your husband begin to change but you
[39:57] still see everything that he does wrong.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Your kids are getting better and closer
[40:03] to God, but but you only see their
[40:05] problems and their failures and their
[40:07] faults.
[40:08] Your wife is becoming who she should be.
[40:11] But you keep you keep looking at her
[40:13] through the glasses, these old lenses
[40:17] instead of acknowledging that the
[40:19] promise is starting to manifest in her
[40:21] life.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; No matter your situation tonight, you
[40:25] have seen the fruits of the promise. You
[40:28] have seen the milk and honey.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Then why are you giving a negative
[40:34] report?
[40:37] Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; They had seen, these spies had seen the
[40:40] milk and honey. But look at their report
[40:43] tonight. Look at their report. This is
[40:46] what they had to say. First they say,
[40:48] truly it flows with milk and honey. Then
[40:51] they say, "Nevertheless,
[40:55] the people who dwell in the land are
[40:57] strong and the cities are fortified and
[41:00] very large. Moreover, we saw the
[41:02] descendants of Anch there. The
[41:04] Amalachite dwell in the land of the
[41:06] south and the Hittite and the Jebusite
[41:09] and the Amorites dwell in the mountains
[41:10] and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and
[41:13] along the banks of the Jordan. Now a
[41:17] true man of God stops them. Caleb
[41:22] quieted the people before Moses and
[41:24] said, "Let's go up at once and take
[41:26] possession for we are well able to to
[41:29] overcome it."
[41:32] There was someone not looking at
[41:34] circumstances
[41:37] but looking at the promise
[41:40] &gt;&gt; but there's nothing he could do about
[41:42] it. You know the spies were too negative
[41:45] and they had a report to give and and
[41:47] they went on and said but the man who
[41:50] had gone up with him said we
[41:54] are not able to go up against the people
[41:57] for they are stronger than we. And they
[41:59] gave the children of Israel a bad report
[42:01] of the land which they had spied out,
[42:03] saying, "The land through which we have
[42:05] gone as spies, is a land that devours
[42:09] its inhabitants, and all the people whom
[42:12] we saw in it are men of great stature.
[42:17] There we saw the giants. The descendants
[42:20] of Anak came from the giants and we were
[42:23] like grasshoppers in our own sight and
[42:26] so we were in their sight.
[42:30] Now pretty much in the same sentence
[42:34] they give the people evidence of the
[42:36] promise and they say we are not able
[42:40] despite the promise and despite all the
[42:43] miracles and despite the milk and
[42:45] despite the honey the spies couldn't
[42:47] look at the situation with spiritual
[42:50] eyes and see victory
[42:53] because they were anointed with a spirit
[42:55] of unbelief.
[42:59] I want you to keep these words in your
[43:01] head tonight. Anointed with a spirit of
[43:04] unbelief. They looked at the
[43:07] circumstances instead of looking at the
[43:10] promise.
[43:13] Isn't that what they did?
[43:16] Isn't that what we do often times?
[43:20] My sickness is too severe.
[43:22] My problem is too big. My wife is too
[43:25] far off. My husband is too lazy. My
[43:27] children are too rebellious. They
[43:29] rejected God. We listen to the report
[43:34] of the spies.
[43:40] We often listen on the report of the
[43:43] spies in our situation
[43:46] and they couldn't wait
[43:50] on God for the fulfilling of the promise
[43:53] because their circumstances were too
[43:55] overwhelming or too frightening. But
[43:58] most of all,
[44:00] they couldn't wait on God for the
[44:02] fulfilling of the promise because they
[44:04] didn't recognize the nature of God
[44:07] towards them.
[44:10] Despite everything he had done for them,
[44:14] they could not recognize his nature
[44:17] towards them, his love for them. You
[44:20] would think that after all God did for
[44:23] them, they would know they are loved and
[44:26] cared for.
[44:30] But when you choose to look at
[44:33] circumstances
[44:34] after all of what God has done for you,
[44:40] you choose to die in the desert instead
[44:44] of entering the promise.
[44:48] And I will show that by the scriptures
[44:50] tonight. You choose to die in the desert
[44:53] instead of entering the promise or the
[44:57] promised land.
[44:59] Worst when you look at the circumstances
[45:02] and ignore ignore what God is doing,
[45:06] you backslide
[45:08] and you do it fast, very fast. You want
[45:12] to see how fast? Let's read it. Numbers
[45:16] 14. All the children of Israel
[45:20] complained against Moses and Aaron.
[45:24] And the whole congregation said to them,
[45:27] "If only we had died in the land of
[45:29] Egypt,
[45:31] or if only we had died in the
[45:32] wilderness, why has the Lord brought us
[45:35] to this land to fall by the sword that
[45:38] our wives and children should become
[45:40] victims? Would it not be better for us
[45:43] to return in Egypt?"
[45:46] So they said to one another, "Let us
[45:48] select a leader and return to Egypt."
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to get the time period
[45:56] here.
[45:58] There wasn't a sun down and a sun up.
[46:01] This is the same day because we'll see
[46:04] later on tonight what happens the next
[46:06] morning. So the spies come back. They
[46:10] give a bad report. The crowd listens to
[46:13] the report and is ready to to appoint a
[46:16] new leader and go back to Egypt.
[46:19] That is how fast you backslide and you
[46:22] think about your old life when you
[46:25] listen to the report of the spies.
[46:27] It is instant and it is brutal. Now the
[46:32] men of God tried to talk them out of it.
[46:36] You know Moses then speak to the people
[46:38] and he and he goes like this. She says,
[46:40] "If the Lord delights in us, then he
[46:43] will bring us into this land and give it
[46:45] to us,
[46:48] a land which flows with milk and honey."
[46:51] See how the man of God is is remembering
[46:54] them the promise. We have evidence. It's
[46:57] a land that flows with milk and honey.
[46:59] God will give it to us. Only do not
[47:01] rebel against the Lord, nor fear the
[47:04] people of the land, for they are our
[47:06] bread. Their protection has departed
[47:09] from them and the Lord is with us. Do
[47:12] not fear them.
[47:17] Does that sound clear to you?
[47:20] Not for the children of Israel.
[47:23] No. Because they had already been
[47:25] anointed
[47:27] by that unbelief spirit because they
[47:29] listened to the report of the spies.
[47:32] They already listened to the report of
[47:34] the spy. The people were so backwards.
[47:36] They were so backslid that they wanted
[47:39] to kill him. As he's trying to stop them
[47:43] and to reason with them, what they do is
[47:45] is is this. And all the congregations
[47:49] said to stone them with stones
[47:55] in the same day.
[47:58] Can you realize after the mana, after
[48:01] the water from the rock, after
[48:03] everything they've been through, after
[48:04] the Red Sea,
[48:07] the spies come back with a false report
[48:09] or a bad report. And in the same day,
[48:12] they're ready to kill Moses and Aaron
[48:14] and go back to Egypt.
[48:19] Now, the glory of the Lord appeared in
[48:21] the tabernacle of meeting before all the
[48:24] children of Israel. Then the Lord said
[48:27] to Moses, "How long will these people
[48:31] reject me? And how long will they not
[48:34] believe me with all the signs which I
[48:37] have performed amongst them?
[48:43] I will strike them
[48:46] and and
[48:48] disenherit them and I will make you a
[48:52] nation greater and mightier than they.
[48:55] Now notice,
[48:58] God is not mad at the people
[49:01] because they are against Moses,
[49:04] but he's mad at the people because they
[49:06] are against himself
[49:09] himself. And he is ready to start a new
[49:12] race with the people who believe the
[49:15] promise and kill everyone else
[49:18] one more time.
[49:21] This is not the first time. He's just
[49:24] did it with Noah.
[49:28] Everybody that didn't believe was killed
[49:32] and he started a fresh. It's it's not
[49:35] long ago, couple hundred years maybe.
[49:39] And and now here he is again furious at
[49:42] unbelief,
[49:44] ready to kill and build a new race with
[49:47] those who believe.
[49:50] But Moses, a type of Christ,
[49:54] defended the people and reasoned with
[49:56] God. And this blesses me so much. He
[49:59] told God, you know, the Egyptians will
[50:02] say, "You are a God that cannot finish
[50:04] what what you start."
[50:06] When when when the Egyptians learned
[50:08] that everybody died in the desert, he
[50:10] will say, "This God, he's a failure. He
[50:14] cannot even bring his plans to pass.
[50:19] You're supposed to be a God who forgives
[50:22] the iniquities of your people. You said
[50:25] you are slow to anger and rich in mercy.
[50:28] Moses is pleading with God
[50:31] trying to save an unbelieving people.
[50:36] Then the Lord said,
[50:39] "I have pardon
[50:43] according to your word."
[50:47] But truly, as I live, all the earth
[50:52] shall be filled with the glory of the
[50:54] Lord. Because all these men who have
[50:56] seen my glory and the signs which I did
[50:59] in Egypt and in the wilderness and have
[51:02] put me to the test now than these 10
[51:05] times and have not heeden my voice, they
[51:09] certainly shall not see the land of
[51:12] which I swore to their fathers, nor
[51:16] shall any of those who rejected me see
[51:19] it. I told you
[51:23] when you choose to listen to the report
[51:26] of the spies
[51:28] and look at the circumstances instead of
[51:31] keeping your eyes on the promise,
[51:34] you choose to die in the wilderness.
[51:40] Now,
[51:43] the man who Moses sent to spy out the
[51:47] land, who returned and made all the
[51:49] congregation complain against him by
[51:52] bringing a bad report of the lamb. Those
[51:55] very men who brought the evil report
[51:57] about the land died by the plague before
[52:01] the Lord. But Joshua, the son of Nun,
[52:04] and Caleb, the son of
[52:06] how do you say that? Jeff,
[52:09] I don't know the the names are different
[52:11] in French, right? Remained alive
[52:14] of the man who went to spy out the land.
[52:18] Now, I want to pause here
[52:21] to say that this story is very much our
[52:23] own.
[52:25] How many times we listen to the spies
[52:29] report, the evil report that is given to
[52:33] us telling us we can't make it, telling
[52:36] us it won't happen. It's physical and
[52:39] it's spiritual spies, both of them.
[52:41] Sometimes, you know, it's through the
[52:43] mouth of someone we love or we know or
[52:46] we respect. Sometimes it's just a devil
[52:49] whispering to our ear.
[52:52] We listen to the spy report. When we
[52:54] listen to the spirit of unbelief
[52:57] whispering in our ear, we listen to this
[53:00] spy report.
[53:02] When we listen to the doctor
[53:05] telling us our cancer is stage 27 or
[53:09] something and and we have only three
[53:11] months to live, we listen each time we
[53:16] take someone else's word instead of
[53:19] God's word of promise. We listen to the
[53:23] report of the spies
[53:26] each time. And each time we listen to
[53:30] these evil reports, the result is fear,
[53:34] anxiety,
[53:36] depression,
[53:37] sometimes even anger
[53:40] because we don't understand.
[53:43] And right away, right away, my friends,
[53:46] we backslide.
[53:49] Right away when we accept the words and
[53:51] the evil reports of the spies, right
[53:54] away something sets inside of us and we
[53:57] start thinking of our old life and how
[54:00] things used to to be before. We start
[54:03] thinking of our Egypt
[54:06] like we talked this morning. Right away
[54:09] we start thinking of our Egypt whatever
[54:12] what it was.
[54:15] And now
[54:17] there is a risk tonight
[54:20] as you listen to this sermon.
[54:23] And now I'm kind of getting to the eye
[54:25] point of tonight's message, which is
[54:29] when you waited for so long, when you
[54:33] were desperate for so long, when when
[54:37] one has a deferred hope, when one has
[54:40] looked to the circumstances
[54:42] for that long and finally wakes up to
[54:46] his own belief, finally wakes up to the
[54:49] fact that he's been looking at
[54:51] circumstances Instead of looking at the
[54:54] promise,
[54:56] when you wake up after you've been
[54:58] waiting for so long, you get a fever.
[55:03] Have you ever heard of a the buck fever?
[55:06] You hunters,
[55:12] the buck fever happens when you've
[55:13] waited so long to see a buck.
[55:18] Then when it finally comes in sight, you
[55:20] can't wait anymore.
[55:22] when you realize you're you're you're
[55:24] getting there, you know, you can't wait
[55:28] anymore for it to position or whatever
[55:30] and you might miss him because you
[55:32] caught a fever. They call it buck fever.
[55:35] You know, in the 80s or the 90s, I'm not
[55:38] sure I was pretty young in them years.
[55:40] There was a space shuttle, Challenger it
[55:43] was called. I'm sure someone has heard
[55:45] of the Challenger space shuttle. It was
[55:48] supposed to launch to space and they put
[55:50] all crew members in the shuttle, you
[55:52] know, and and they closed the door and
[55:54] they were ready for departure, but the
[55:56] weather, the temperatures couldn't allow
[55:58] it. It was windy or something and they
[56:01] couldn't leave
[56:04] launch.
[56:06] So, they had to wait for many days,
[56:07] days, and days for temperature to change
[56:10] so they could launch. So they waited and
[56:13] waited impatient for many days with
[56:16] their eyes set on the circumstances.
[56:18] They looked the temperature. They look
[56:20] at different things and they just
[56:22] wanted, you know, it was a big event. It
[56:24] was a big deal for the country that
[56:27] space shuttle. It was supposed to be on
[56:29] TV, I guess. And everybody was in
[56:31] expectation and waiting. So So when all
[56:34] of a sudden the weather changed and
[56:36] allowed a departure, you know what they
[56:38] did? They rushed it.
[56:41] They skipped all the security stuff and
[56:43] different things and they rushed the
[56:46] departure and and 70 seconds after
[56:49] departure, the space shuttle exploded
[56:53] and everybody died.
[56:55] And this tra tragic event led to the
[56:58] creation of an expression called go
[57:01] fever.
[57:03] Have you ever heard about go fever?
[57:06] Go fever means I'm tired of waiting and
[57:08] I'm rushing to take action
[57:13] and it is very dangerous.
[57:16] In fact, it is more dangerous.
[57:20] It's worse than waiting.
[57:25] It's worse.
[57:27] Now the expression may have been coined
[57:29] in 1990 but the urge to take action
[57:35] has been around for much longer.
[57:38] You know when the children of Israel
[57:41] learned that the spies were dead.
[57:44] Now let's go back to the children of
[57:46] Israel. So here's the chain of event.
[57:48] The spies come back. They give an evil
[57:51] report.
[57:53] The people believe the report. They want
[57:56] to stone Moses and go back to Egypt. The
[57:59] Lord appears
[58:02] and says, "These guys who gave evil
[58:04] reports, these guys will die." And now
[58:07] the spies
[58:09] are dead.
[58:12] Now the children of Israel learn that
[58:15] the spies are dead.
[58:19] And when they learn it, they catch go
[58:21] fever.
[58:23] Now they they completely changed mindset
[58:27] and they rose early in the morning and
[58:30] went up to the top of the mountain. Now
[58:32] that's the next morning.
[58:36] The next morning they raise up early
[58:39] because the spies are dead
[58:42] and so we we must take the land now.
[58:47] They they just flip.
[58:49] They go up to the top of the mountain
[58:51] saying, "Here we are, and we will go up
[58:53] to take the space which the Lord has
[58:55] promised, for we have sinned.
[58:59] Go fever." And Moses said, "Now, why do
[59:05] you transgress the coming of the Lord?
[59:08] For this will not succeed. Do not go up,
[59:12] lest you be defeated by your enemies,
[59:15] for the Lord is not among you.
[59:19] For the Amalachite and the Canaanite are
[59:22] there before you, and you shall fall by
[59:25] the sword, because you have turned away
[59:27] from the Lord. The Lord will not be with
[59:30] you." But they presumed to go
[59:35] to go up to the mountaintop.
[59:38] Nevertheless, neither the ark of the
[59:40] covenant of the Lord nor Moses departed
[59:42] from the camp. Then the Amalachites and
[59:45] the Canaanites who dwelt in that
[59:47] mountain came down and attacked them and
[59:50] drove them back as far as Hora
[59:55] and they killed them. Another version
[59:57] says they killed them as far back as
[1:00:01] Hora.
[1:00:03] Now when you read this in context, this
[1:00:07] event seems to support the spies report.
[1:00:12] Think of it. Here are the spies. They
[1:00:14] come back and they say, "We are not able
[1:00:17] to take the land. Our enemies are too
[1:00:20] strong." Here are the people of Israel
[1:00:23] saying, "Let's go. Let's take the land."
[1:00:26] And there they are killed and defeated.
[1:00:30] One might say, "The spies were right. Or
[1:00:34] are they dead?" They were right. We are
[1:00:37] not able.
[1:00:39] We've just been defeated.
[1:00:42] You see,
[1:00:44] waiting
[1:00:46] in fear is bad,
[1:00:51] but going is worse.
[1:00:54] You might say, "Brother Joel, but what
[1:00:56] must what must we do?" If we can't wait
[1:00:59] and and we can't go, what's the point of
[1:01:02] your sermon? It's really depressing.
[1:01:06] We must wait
[1:01:09] upon the Lord
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; for the fulfillment of his promise
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; because he made a promise and he will
[1:01:19] bring it to pass.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; He's the one who made it and he's the
[1:01:24] one who will fulfill it.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; He cannot fulfill it if you're in
[1:01:28] unbelief, but he cannot fulfill it if
[1:01:31] you're trying to fulfill it yourself.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:01:36] Counter steer is so bad. What happens
[1:01:40] with us in in what is the danger
[1:01:41] preaching this sermon is once I realize
[1:01:44] I've been looking at circumstances and
[1:01:46] I've been waiting for so long in fear
[1:01:48] and listening to the spies report.
[1:01:50] There's a tendency to counter steer and
[1:01:53] be like I'm done waiting. I believe on
[1:01:56] the promise I'mma make it happen. It's
[1:01:58] bad.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; You cannot fix a mistake with a mistake.
[1:02:03] Tonight
[1:02:06] you might be waking up and saying, you
[1:02:09] know, I'm done looking at circumstances.
[1:02:12] Amen.
[1:02:14] You might say, I don't want to be a
[1:02:15] backslider, brother. Amen.
[1:02:19] I don't want to be in unbelief. Amen.
[1:02:23] I'm going to take over the land. Let's
[1:02:25] have war.
[1:02:27] Beware, my brother.
[1:02:30] Be careful.
[1:02:31] You do have a promise, but you cannot
[1:02:35] bring the promise to pass yourself.
[1:02:38] You must wait upon the Lord for the
[1:02:40] fulfillment of the promise. He made a
[1:02:43] promise and he will bring it to pass.
[1:02:46] All he is asking,
[1:02:48] all he's asking us, all he's asking you
[1:02:52] is to believe him, not to fall into
[1:02:55] unbelief, fear, and discouragement.
[1:02:58] and have the spiritual eyes of faith to
[1:03:02] see each step of the way towards the
[1:03:06] fulfilling of the promise. That's what
[1:03:09] the children of Israel missed there. The
[1:03:12] reason they they they could accept the
[1:03:14] report of the spies so easily is because
[1:03:17] they didn't recount the blessings of
[1:03:19] God.
[1:03:21] They didn't have the spiritual eyes of
[1:03:23] faith to see that. That the mana wasn't
[1:03:26] promised, but it was a step towards the
[1:03:29] fulfillment of the promise. That the
[1:03:31] water from the rock wasn't a promise,
[1:03:33] but it was a step towards the
[1:03:35] fulfillment of the promise.
[1:03:40] Can I share something with you before we
[1:03:43] close
[1:03:44] about the spirit of unbelief? You know
[1:03:48] there is a scripture that puzzled me for
[1:03:50] years and I mean years and it is the
[1:03:53] story of Jesus healing the boy with the
[1:03:56] mute spirit. You know that story.
[1:04:00] So
[1:04:03] basically the father brought his boy to
[1:04:05] Jesus disciple and they couldn't heal
[1:04:08] him. So so then the father brings his
[1:04:11] boy to the feet of Jesus. you you have
[1:04:14] for those of you if someone taking note
[1:04:16] Mark 9 and ma Matthew chapter 17 um we
[1:04:20] we will not read it but and now he comes
[1:04:24] to the feet of Jesus and he asks Jesus
[1:04:27] if you can do anything please help my
[1:04:29] boy
[1:04:31] and Jesus answers
[1:04:33] and says if you can believe
[1:04:38] all things are possible to him who
[1:04:40] believes
[1:04:41] and and now the account says
[1:04:45] immediately
[1:04:47] the father of the child cried out and
[1:04:51] said with tears
[1:04:53] Lord I believe help my unbelief.
[1:04:58] Now we'll get back to that that
[1:05:00] statement from the father in a moment.
[1:05:03] Here's the part that puzzled me.
[1:05:07] Jesus then proceeds to speak to the
[1:05:10] demon in the boy. Here here's how it it
[1:05:14] goes.
[1:05:16] Jesus after he told the father
[1:05:21] if you can
[1:05:24] anything is possible to them that
[1:05:26] believe. The father says I believe help
[1:05:29] my unbelief with tears. Then Jesus
[1:05:32] proceeds to tell the boy or the the
[1:05:34] demon in the boy rather, I command you
[1:05:37] to get out of the boy and come back no
[1:05:40] more.
[1:05:44] That doesn't sound very complicated,
[1:05:46] does it?
[1:05:48] It sound sounds pretty simple.
[1:05:51] But when his disciples
[1:05:54] come to him and ask why couldn't we heal
[1:05:58] him?
[1:06:00] Then Jesus tells them, "This kind does
[1:06:04] not go out except by prayer and
[1:06:05] fasting."
[1:06:07] You remember the story?
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:06:12] this puzzled me. It bothered me almost
[1:06:15] for years because here is Jesus
[1:06:19] not fasting,
[1:06:21] not even praying.
[1:06:24] He's just he's just speaking to the
[1:06:28] demon. and the demon leaves. But right
[1:06:31] away, he tells his disciple, "This kind
[1:06:34] only goes out by fasting and praying."
[1:06:37] And I couldn't reconcile it. It bothered
[1:06:40] me. And and I ended up making peace with
[1:06:43] it by saying, "Oh, you know, it's
[1:06:45] because he's God."
[1:06:49] Maybe somebody else tonight went through
[1:06:52] that train of thought, you know, oh,
[1:06:55] it's because he's God. and and it's
[1:06:58] different for God than it is for the
[1:07:01] disciples.
[1:07:03] But this past summer,
[1:07:07] I read it maybe 10 times in a row. It
[1:07:09] came back to mind. I had a a
[1:07:12] conversation, a fellowship with a fellow
[1:07:14] pastor and and and we were talking about
[1:07:17] these things and and casting demons and
[1:07:19] stuff. And we read it this morning, Mark
[1:07:22] 16, you know, here are the signs that
[1:07:24] will follow them that believe. In my
[1:07:25] name they shall cast out devils.
[1:07:29] There's no mentioning of fasting or
[1:07:31] nothing. It says in my name they shall
[1:07:33] cast out devils. Now,
[1:07:36] so I opened my Bible and I read it and I
[1:07:41] said, "Lord, I don't understand." And
[1:07:43] then I read it again and then I read it
[1:07:45] again and it made no sense. And I read
[1:07:47] it again and then I read it again. You
[1:07:49] know Jesus on earth, he he didn't use
[1:07:52] any extra privileges.
[1:07:55] The account says that when he went to
[1:07:57] Nazareth, he couldn't do many miracles
[1:07:59] there because of his of their unbelief.
[1:08:01] You know, he he lived a life so we can
[1:08:04] model our life after him and be
[1:08:06] disciples.
[1:08:08] And and I read it again
[1:08:11] and and I said, Lord, you said in my
[1:08:14] name they shall cast out devils. Not not
[1:08:17] in fasting. They shall cast out devils.
[1:08:20] I don't get it. And all of a sudden,
[1:08:22] boom,
[1:08:25] I got it. Lord shown me something. And
[1:08:29] it all made sense. And I want to share
[1:08:32] it with you tonight.
[1:08:34] And I hope it'll do some something for
[1:08:37] at least one of you.
[1:08:40] You see,
[1:08:45] God had to deal with two different
[1:08:48] spirit in that story.
[1:08:51] The mute spirit was the spirit easy to
[1:08:54] deal with.
[1:08:56] When God had to deal with the mute
[1:08:58] spirit,
[1:08:59] he just spoke to the spirit and said,
[1:09:03] "Get out of the child." And the spirit
[1:09:05] left. He cast it out instantly.
[1:09:10] But here are the disciples
[1:09:13] after the miracle has just been done.
[1:09:16] They come to him with pride almost.
[1:09:20] They don't come to him like the dad
[1:09:23] saying with teary eyes, you know, God
[1:09:26] help my unbelief. No. No. They come at
[1:09:30] they come like spoiled kids. They come
[1:09:33] asking why can't we do it?
[1:09:37] Why can't we do it?
[1:09:39] The kid came to us and we tried and it
[1:09:41] didn't work like it was a recipe or
[1:09:44] something. Let's read it. Matthew
[1:09:46] chapter 17.
[1:09:48] Then the disciples came to Jesus
[1:09:51] privately and said, "Why could we not
[1:09:54] cast it out?"
[1:09:57] And Jesus said to them,
[1:09:59] "Because
[1:10:01] of your unbelief.
[1:10:10] There is the spirit of unbelief
[1:10:14] whispering the ears of the apostles
[1:10:19] and anointing them because of your
[1:10:23] unbelief.
[1:10:24] For assuredly I say to you, if you have
[1:10:27] faith as a mustard seed, you will say to
[1:10:29] this mountain, "Move from here to
[1:10:31] there," and it will move, and nothing
[1:10:33] will be impossible for you. However,
[1:10:37] this kind does not go out except by
[1:10:42] prayer
[1:10:44] and fasting.
[1:10:47] the spirit of unbelief.
[1:10:52] He is not addressing the little boy. Now
[1:10:55] they ask him a question.
[1:10:59] Why could we not do it? And he tells
[1:11:01] them it's because of the spirit of
[1:11:05] unbelief.
[1:11:07] This kind does not go out except by
[1:11:11] prayer and fasting.
[1:11:16] This was the hard problem of the two
[1:11:20] because that spirit of unbelief is often
[1:11:23] accompanied by pride and ego
[1:11:28] and and unb
[1:11:30] we we have to become serious about it.
[1:11:33] We have to be wanting to get rid of the
[1:11:36] influence of unbelief on our lives.
[1:11:39] Whatever it takes. We have to come to a
[1:11:42] point where we say, "I don't want to
[1:11:45] hear the evil report of the spy anymore.
[1:11:48] I want to have faith in the promises and
[1:11:52] faith in my Lord.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; I want to get rid of it."
[1:11:59] It's because of your unbelief, says
[1:12:01] Jesus.
[1:12:03] This kind does not go out easily.
[1:12:08] You have to become serious about it. You
[1:12:11] have to be ready to pray and to fast if
[1:12:14] you need to.
[1:12:21] It did something to me,
[1:12:25] something very special. You know, right
[1:12:28] away I broke down into tears
[1:12:32] and I realized that, you know, these
[1:12:35] were the disciples.
[1:12:38] They were close to Jesus. They had seen
[1:12:40] all the miracles. They they even thought
[1:12:42] they could. They tried. You know, when
[1:12:45] when the boy came, they didn't say, "Oh,
[1:12:47] we can't go see Jesus." They tried.
[1:12:50] They were not aware of the spirit of
[1:12:53] unbelief in their lives. They were not.
[1:12:57] But they have been made aware when they
[1:12:59] asked the question. And not only did
[1:13:02] Jesus tell them what the problem was,
[1:13:04] but he told them how to get rid of it.
[1:13:09] And the spirit
[1:13:12] is telling us tonight how to get rid of
[1:13:14] it.
[1:13:16] It doesn't go out easily. But there must
[1:13:20] be a point in our Christian lives where
[1:13:22] we are ready to do whatever it takes to
[1:13:25] be freed from that spirit of unbelief
[1:13:27] and that spy on our shoulder that keeps
[1:13:30] whispering evil reports to us and and
[1:13:33] and binding our faith and and keeping it
[1:13:36] paralyzed to where we cannot truly
[1:13:38] believe the promises of God, but we keep
[1:13:41] giving false or bad reports of our
[1:13:44] situation and being negative about our
[1:13:46] situation even though we've seen the
[1:13:48] fruit of the promise. And we've seen
[1:13:50] milk and honey
[1:13:52] because we have
[1:13:54] I know we have. Everybody in here could
[1:13:57] say, "Oh, all the things that God has
[1:14:01] done for me."
[1:14:03] You have enough evidence of God's love
[1:14:07] for you. You should be able
[1:14:11] to hold to the promise and wait on the
[1:14:15] Lord for the fulfilling of the promise
[1:14:16] in your life. and not look at the
[1:14:19] circumstances.
[1:14:21] Sometimes
[1:14:23] as I finish I want to read Psalms 37.
[1:14:27] You know the spies they will use any and
[1:14:30] all you give them to come and give you
[1:14:33] evil reports. They will use whatever you
[1:14:36] give them. And sometimes I think this is
[1:14:39] what happens. Psalms 37 goes like this.
[1:14:43] Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for
[1:14:47] him. That is what I've been preaching
[1:14:50] tonight. But look at the second part.
[1:14:53] Do not fret because of him who prospers
[1:14:56] in his way. And I think that sometimes
[1:15:01] that is what is upsetting. And it's a
[1:15:04] door that the spy uses to give us a
[1:15:06] false report, which is look how blessed
[1:15:11] he is.
[1:15:14] He's not sick. Why are you sick? He's
[1:15:17] not.
[1:15:21] Do not fret because of him who prospers
[1:15:25] in his way. Look at his business. It's
[1:15:27] doing so well. Oh, look at this family.
[1:15:30] They have no issue whatsoever with their
[1:15:32] kids.
[1:15:34] But you got all of these problems. Look
[1:15:37] at your family. It's not like this
[1:15:40] family.
[1:15:42] And then you get upset
[1:15:45] because you look at circumstances, not
[1:15:47] only yours, but you get into comparison.
[1:15:50] This is a sickness comparison.
[1:15:54] It's an evil report from the spies.
[1:15:58] Oh, or or or you know, look at them.
[1:16:01] They have no money problem. Money flows
[1:16:03] for them. Why are you so tight? You've
[1:16:06] prayed God to answer.
[1:16:09] Why isn't he answering? These are the
[1:16:11] report of the spies.
[1:16:13] And and the Bible is clear. Wait
[1:16:16] patiently for him. Do not fret because
[1:16:20] of him who prospers in his way.
[1:16:24] Don't listen to the report of the spy or
[1:16:27] you will backslide right away. You will
[1:16:31] lose even what you already have.
[1:16:35] You will not only lose the fulfilling of
[1:16:37] the promise, but you will lose what you
[1:16:39] already have. The joy you had this
[1:16:42] morning, you've lost this afternoon. If
[1:16:44] you listened to the report of the spy
[1:16:48] musicians could come
[1:16:53] as I close, I want to read Hebrews
[1:16:55] chapter 10.
[1:16:57] For you have need of hindrance,
[1:17:02] so that after you have done the will of
[1:17:04] God,
[1:17:07] you may
[1:17:09] receive the promise.
[1:17:15] Folks,
[1:17:18] the promise
[1:17:21] is unconditional
[1:17:25] even for the children of Israel. You
[1:17:27] know, God
[1:17:30] told Moses, "Send the spies to look at
[1:17:36] the land which I have given you."
[1:17:41] Not not to look at the land and see if
[1:17:45] you're able to get the land or see if
[1:17:48] it's the right land. No, the land that I
[1:17:51] have given you.
[1:17:55] But we say the promise is unconditional.
[1:17:58] But in fact,
[1:18:02] the kind of is a condition
[1:18:04] and it's that we believe.
[1:18:07] That is all of what is required from us
[1:18:11] to believe
[1:18:14] the promise
[1:18:16] to believe the word of the Lord and when
[1:18:19] we don't believe you know it struck me
[1:18:23] as I was preparing this sermon to see
[1:18:26] that because we always we know the story
[1:18:28] of the children of Israel so so well you
[1:18:31] know in the 40 years in the desert
[1:18:33] turning round and should have taken
[1:18:35] three days and it took for 40 years and
[1:18:38] we know these things. But for me to
[1:18:41] really grasp and realize that the sole
[1:18:44] reason why they had to stay 40 years in
[1:18:47] the desert and everybody who disbelieved
[1:18:51] didn't never see the land.
[1:18:54] The sole reason was disbelief
[1:18:57] or unbelief.
[1:18:59] The sole reason up to that point in time
[1:19:03] there was no plan of them spending 40
[1:19:06] years in the desert.
[1:19:08] But when they disbelieved
[1:19:12] after all God had done for them, God
[1:19:15] said, "All of those who have seen what I
[1:19:19] have done in Egypt and are still
[1:19:22] disbelieving me
[1:19:24] will not see the fulfilling of the
[1:19:27] promise.
[1:19:29] I have done so much for you. God says
[1:19:33] tonight.
[1:19:35] Will you please
[1:19:38] believe me?
[1:19:41] Will you please anchor your soul in in
[1:19:46] my word and in the promises I've given
[1:19:49] you and wait patiently for me to fulfill
[1:19:53] the promise in your life?
[1:19:57] Someone here tonight has been listening
[1:20:01] to the evil report of the spy for too
[1:20:03] long. Whether it be health or
[1:20:07] relationship or family issues or money
[1:20:10] issues or whatever it might be in your
[1:20:13] life,
[1:20:15] you have had enough blessings in your
[1:20:19] life to know the nature of God towards
[1:20:22] you.
[1:20:24] But tonight, you got to wake up and
[1:20:26] realize I've been listening
[1:20:29] to that true devil on my shoulder. And I
[1:20:33] keep
[1:20:35] giving bad reports of my situation
[1:20:38] despite all of what the Lord has done
[1:20:41] for me.
[1:20:44] And and I believe
[1:20:47] that this father, the father of this
[1:20:51] mute boy, he had the right attitude.
[1:20:56] His confession is amazing to me
[1:21:00] with the same words in the same
[1:21:02] sentence.
[1:21:03] He gets there and he says, "I believe."
[1:21:06] first words.
[1:21:08] But then in humility, he says,
[1:21:11] "If I have some unbelief in here, help
[1:21:14] my unbelief, Lord."
[1:21:18] He's not like, "Oh, yes, I believe. I've
[1:21:20] been believing for 40 years." No, he's
[1:21:23] humble.
[1:21:25] He believes, but he realized if there's
[1:21:28] anything inside of him in of him
[1:21:31] hindering the fulfilling of the promise,
[1:21:34] he needs help.
[1:21:38] And someone tonight,
[1:21:40] I believe with all my heart,
[1:21:44] needs help from the Lord, not from me.
[1:21:48] Someone needs to say, "Father, forgive
[1:21:52] my unbelief.
[1:21:54] Help my unbelief.
[1:21:56] I believe. Let me anchor my soul in your
[1:22:01] word and in [music] your promises. And
[1:22:04] let me remind myself every day of my
[1:22:06] life of your love for me and your divine
[1:22:10] nature towards me.
[1:22:13] I want to walk in the promises
[1:22:17] of God.
[1:22:19] I don't want to go back to Egypt. I
[1:22:22] don't want to stone my pastor.
[1:22:25] I don't want to be negative. I want to
[1:22:28] be a testimony,
[1:22:31] a faithful
[1:22:33] believer.
[1:22:36] Let us pray.
[1:22:41] Father,
[1:22:47] I'm sorry
[1:22:51] for I have listened to the report of the
[1:22:54] spies
[1:22:57] and I have been negative
[1:23:01] about my situation
[1:23:05] despite all that you've [music] done for
[1:23:07] me.
[1:23:09] But I comely tonight and I ask,
[1:23:12] Lord, can you help my unbelief?
[1:23:16] I don't want to listen to the report of
[1:23:19] the spies anymore. But
[1:23:23] I want to anchor my soul in your
[1:23:24] promises.
[1:23:27] Lord, you've done so many great things
[1:23:29] for me
[1:23:31] and I thank you.
[1:23:34] Help
[1:23:36] me to be patient, Lord, and to wait on
[1:23:39] you,
[1:23:42] not to rush and try to fulfill the
[1:23:45] promises or make things happen by
[1:23:47] myself, but to be faithful and believing
[1:23:52] and ready,
[1:23:54] but waiting on you because you are the
[1:23:58] one who made the promises.
[1:24:00] and I know you are faithful and able to
[1:24:04] bring him to pass.
[1:24:07] And I want to thank you in advance.
[1:24:10] Not only for I want to thank you for
[1:24:12] what you you've done for me already, but
[1:24:15] I want to thank you in advance tonight,
[1:24:17] but for for what you're about to do in
[1:24:20] my life. And I want to thank you for
[1:24:22] what you're about to do in the lives of
[1:24:24] my brothers and sisters
[1:24:26] as they get rid of this spirit of
[1:24:28] unbelief or the influence of this spirit
[1:24:31] over their lives and you choose
[1:24:35] to anchor their souls
[1:24:38] upon your word of promise.
[1:24:43] Thank you Jesus.
[1:24:46] Thank you Jesus.
[1:24:48] You are so merciful, Father. You don't
[1:24:51] hold it against us, but you you love us
[1:24:55] and and you forgive us. And
[1:25:00] Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:25:07] Hallelujah.
[1:25:11] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:25:26] Faithfulness
[1:25:28] walked beside me.
[1:25:35] Storms
[1:25:37] make [music]
[1:25:43] every season
[1:25:46] from where I stand
[1:25:50] [music]
[1:25:50] I see the evidence of your goodness
[1:25:57] all over my life.
[1:26:01] All over my life
[1:26:06] and [music] I see [singing]
[1:26:08] promises in fulfillment
[1:26:12] all [music] over my life.
[1:26:16] all over my life.
[1:26:22] I meant
[1:26:24] when I [music] leave.
[1:26:29] Oh, the fear [singing] may come to fear.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Fear has to leave tonight.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. [music] My heart to victory.
[1:26:43] [music]
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, you do. You are my strength and you
[1:26:48] always [singing and music] will be. And
[1:26:52] I see the evidence of your goodness
[1:26:58] all over my life.
[1:27:02] All over my life.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And I see [singing]
[1:27:09] promises in fulfillment
[1:27:12] [music]
[1:27:13] all over my life.
[1:27:17] All over my life.
[1:27:20] [music]
[1:27:22] See the cross, [singing] the empty
[1:27:24] grave.
[1:27:25] The evidence [music] is in this. All my
[1:27:30] sin [singing] rolled away [music]
[1:27:32] because of you, oh Jesus.
[1:27:36] See the cross, the empty grave.
[1:27:40] The evidence [music and singing] is
[1:27:41] evidence.
[1:27:43] All my sin rolled away [singing]
[1:27:47] because [music] of you, oh Jesus.
[1:27:50] Oh,
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; sing it [music] like you mean it,
[1:27:53] church.
[1:27:58] And I see evidence of your goodness
[1:28:04] all over my life.
[1:28:08] All over my life.
[1:28:14] And I see your promises in fulfillment
[1:28:20] all over my life.
[1:28:24] All of my life. Once more I see [music]
[1:28:29] I see [singing]
[1:28:31] evidence of your goodness
[1:28:35] all over my life. [music]
[1:28:39] All over my life.
[1:28:43] Oh, I see [music] promises
[1:28:47] fulfillment
[1:28:50] all around.
[1:28:54] I am
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; church.
[1:29:00] If you have
[1:29:02] listened to the report
[1:29:05] of the spy for your health, for your
[1:29:07] family, for your finances, whatever it
[1:29:10] might be, tonight is time to step out in
[1:29:14] faith.
[1:29:16] It's time tonight to step out in faith
[1:29:21] and claim the promise
[1:29:24] and anchor your soul to the promise. No
[1:29:27] matter what the circumstances are, just
[1:29:31] anchor your soul there and wait for the
[1:29:34] fulfillment [music] and you will see it
[1:29:38] come to pass and it'll be such a great
[1:29:41] testimony [music]
[1:29:43] that'll bring honor and glory to him.
[1:29:46] I hope I can hear some of those
[1:29:49] testimonies in the near future. God
[1:29:52] bless you, church. I love you.
[1:29:56] [applause]
[1:30:02] I love you, Lord.
[1:30:06] For your mercy never fails me.
[1:30:11] And all [music and singing] my days I've
[1:30:14] been held in your hands.
[1:30:19] From the moment that I wake [singing] up
[1:30:23] [music] until I lay my head.
[1:30:27] Oh, [singing] I will sing
[1:30:29] of the goodness of God.
[1:30:36] For all my life, you [singing] have been
[1:30:39] [music] faithful.
[1:30:44] And all my [music and singing] life you
[1:30:46] have been so so good.
[1:30:51] With [music] every [singing] breath that
[1:30:53] I am able.
[1:30:56] Oh, I will sing of the goodness [music]
[1:31:01] of God.
[1:31:03] And I love your voice.
[1:31:07] Oh, you have led me through the fire
[1:31:12] in a darkest night. You are [music]
[1:31:16] close like no other.
[1:31:20] I've known you as a father.
[1:31:21] [music and singing]
[1:31:23] I've known you as my friend. [music] And
[1:31:27] I have
[1:31:29] in the goodness of God. Let's all stand.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; For all my life, [music and singing]
[1:31:37] you have been faithful.
[1:31:42] And all my [music] life you have been so
[1:31:46] so good.
[1:31:49] is every [singing] breath that I make.
[1:31:53] [music]
[1:31:54] Oh, I will sing of the goodness.
[1:32:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:06] Friends,
[1:32:08] don't believe the lies of the spies.
[1:32:14] If you want to look over,
[1:32:16] just get up on the hill and look over.
[1:32:20] God gave it to us.
[1:32:22] He said, as our brother said,
[1:32:27] sent the spies over into land, the spy
[1:32:29] out to spy out the land that I already
[1:32:31] gave you.
[1:32:34] I love that
[1:32:36] so many people believe those lies. And
[1:32:39] they are lies.
[1:32:42] Let's bow our heads.
[1:32:48] There are so many lies in the world,
[1:32:50] friends.
[1:32:53] Lies that people say, that people tell
[1:32:55] you. And it's so easy to believe a lie.
[1:33:01] Why is it so hard to believe the truth?
[1:33:07] Don't believe these lies?
[1:33:11] Be mature in the gospel.
[1:33:15] These lies may come.
[1:33:21] They may come from a friend. They may
[1:33:24] come from a doctor. They may come from
[1:33:27] wherever wherever it is. But if it's a
[1:33:30] negative report that puts fear in your
[1:33:32] heart, then it is a lie.
[1:33:36] Father,
[1:33:39] I'm sorry, Lord. As our brother said, I
[1:33:42] echo what he said. I'm sorry for
[1:33:43] believing lies.
[1:33:46] Lord, you have given us this land.
[1:33:49] You've given us this church.
[1:33:52] You've given us life.
[1:33:55] And Lord, forgive us for believing
[1:34:00] the spies and what they have said. But
[1:34:04] Lord, there was a Joshua and a Caleb
[1:34:07] that went over and spied out that land.
[1:34:10] and they brought a good report.
[1:34:13] I want to believe that good report.
[1:34:15] Father,
[1:34:18] thank you that there are men in this
[1:34:23] world [music]
[1:34:24] that will point to the good things and
[1:34:27] the promises of God. And as Abraham did,
[1:34:31] he took those things that were not as
[1:34:33] though they were.
[1:34:36] Lord, we thank you
[1:34:38] now. Father, we reject the lies and
[1:34:42] we've pressed towards
[1:34:45] that prize, Father,
[1:34:48] that you have given us. We thank you.
[1:34:52] Thank you for our brother Joel, the
[1:34:54] messages that he brought us today,
[1:34:56] encouragement. Father, we thank you.
[1:34:59] Now, Lord, we pray that we would take
[1:35:01] what you've given us tonight
[1:35:04] and Lord, let us beware.
[1:35:07] Help us, Father, when the when the lies
[1:35:10] come into our ears. Lord, let us
[1:35:12] remember this sermon tonight and say,
[1:35:14] "I'm not gonna believe it." God made a
[1:35:17] promise and I will stand on his promise.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us bring that to our
[1:35:22] remembrance. Father, when these lies
[1:35:24] come to us in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:35:32] All my life you [singing] have been
[1:35:36] faithful.
[1:35:41] All my [singing] life you have been so
[1:35:44] [music]
[1:35:45] so good.
[1:35:48] With every breath that I
[1:35:50] [music and singing]
[1:35:51] am able.
[1:35:54] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[1:35:59] of God.
[1:36:03] Your [music] goodness is running after.
[1:36:06] It's running after me.
[1:36:10] Your [music and singing] goodness is
[1:36:12] running after. It's running after me.
[1:36:17] With my life [music and singing] laid
[1:36:18] down, I surrender now. I give you
[1:36:22] everything.
[1:36:25] Your goodness is [music] running after
[1:36:28] is running after me.
[1:36:35] All my life [music]
[1:36:36] you have been faithful.
[1:36:43] All my life you have been so so good.
[1:36:50] every [music and singing] breath that I
[1:36:53] am.
[1:36:55] [music] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[1:37:00] of God.
