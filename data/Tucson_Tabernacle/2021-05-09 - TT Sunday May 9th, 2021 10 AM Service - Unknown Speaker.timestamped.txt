[30:21] are you thankful we still have a
[30:22] privilege to gather publicly as
[30:24] christians
[30:25] oh you say brother daniel i thought we
[30:27] were always going to have that no we may
[30:28] not have that someday
[30:30] you know so most people would think the
[30:31] tribulation was on if that happened but
[30:33] you got to remember that our brothers
[30:34] and sisters before that they met in the
[30:36] catacombs they met just wherever they
[30:38] could
[30:38] it may happen again i say we appreciate
[30:40] the day that we have
[30:42] my grandfather used to get out of open
[30:44] throw his legs out of bed push the
[30:46] curtain open and he'd say this is the
[30:48] day that the lord has made i will
[30:49] rejoice and be glad in it
[30:51] amen we're going to do something a
[30:53] little bit different we're going to read
[30:55] together maybe psalms 139
[30:57] if you have your bibles we call it
[31:00] reciprocal reading back home
[31:02] we do it on sunday morning we pick a
[31:03] psalm and the
[31:05] the speaker will read the first verse
[31:07] and then the audience read the second
[31:08] verse and we read that way through the
[31:10] whole chapter
[31:11] and then maybe read the last verse verse
[31:13] 24
[31:14] altogether so psalms 139 i don't know if
[31:17] the brothers have it if somebody
[31:18] how'd they say it the sisters with the
[31:20] babies want to be able to hold their
[31:21] babies and still see it on the screen
[31:23] we as warriors like to take our sword
[31:25] and know right where it is in our
[31:27] bible psalms 139
[31:30] maybe we'll read this together do we
[31:32] have somebody back there that can pull
[31:33] it up on the
[31:34] on the overhead well
[31:37] let's go ahead and do it all right
[31:39] psalms 139
[31:41] oh lord thou has searched me and knowing
[31:44] me
[31:52] amen that was really good thou compasses
[31:55] my path
[31:56] and my lying down and art acquainted
[31:58] with all my ways
[32:07] thou hast beset me behind and before and
[32:10] has laid thine hand upon me
[32:20] whether shall i go from thy spirit or
[32:23] whether shall i
[32:24] flee from thy presence
[32:34] if i take the wings of the morning and
[32:37] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea
[32:45] i hope you're seeing that david is
[32:47] saying that god knows every place that
[32:49] he is
[32:50] now you got to realize that the devil he
[32:52] can't create so all he does is
[32:54] pervert and duplicate what god has done
[32:57] so
[32:58] with science and technology he's tried
[33:00] to duplicate what god has done and gives
[33:01] you a cell phone so he can know where
[33:03] you go
[33:04] if you go under the earth he knows you
[33:05] there if you're flying in an airplane he
[33:07] knows you're there
[33:08] your phone knows when you lay down and
[33:09] it stops moving for a time they assume
[33:11] you're sleeping
[33:12] so the devil is just trying to duplicate
[33:14] what god had
[33:15] thousands and thousands of years ago god
[33:18] already had it he already knows your
[33:19] down settings he already knows your
[33:21] upright
[33:22] uprisings amen verse number 12
[33:25] or was it 12 that we read the last one
[33:27] let's start with 11.
[33:28] if i shall say surely the darkness shall
[33:30] cover me even the night shall be light
[33:33] about me
[33:44] for thou hast possessed my reigns thou
[33:47] has covered me in my mother's womb
[34:00] my substance was not hid from thee when
[34:03] i was
[34:04] made in secret and curiously raw in the
[34:07] lower
[34:08] lowest parts of the earth
[34:24] amen aren't you thankful that god saw
[34:27] your substance even when you're
[34:28] unperfect
[34:30] amen we're not perfect now but by the
[34:32] blood of jesus christ but even when we
[34:34] weren't perfect god saw us
[34:36] verse number 17 how precious also are
[34:39] their thoughts unto me
[34:41] oh god how great is the sum of them
[34:53] hey man my wife and i read this psalm
[34:54] the other day and it just really struck
[34:56] us verse 17
[34:58] god says how great are the some of my
[35:01] thoughts towards you
[35:03] if we would ever get read these verses
[35:05] it'll take care of depression and
[35:07] anxiety and all of those things when the
[35:09] word of god says
[35:10] daniel i've been thinking you don't have
[35:12] any idea the sum the amount of the
[35:14] thoughts that i'm thinking about you
[35:16] now if you could put your name in that
[35:17] verse and know god has a great sum of
[35:19] thoughts
[35:20] that he's thinking about every one of
[35:22] you he knows your down
[35:23] settings your uprising everything about
[35:25] you isn't that wonderful
[35:27] amen god knows about you the creator of
[35:29] heavens and the earth and the thing
[35:30] about it he can be so great
[35:32] he can know that about every individual
[35:34] in the world seven billion people
[35:36] he knows all of that about them and he
[35:38] says my thoughts towards you are great
[35:40] if i should count them they are more in
[35:42] number than the sands of the sea
[35:45] next time you go to the beach just look
[35:46] at the sands of the sea and think the
[35:48] bible says those are like the thoughts
[35:50] of god towards me
[35:51] that's how many times he thinks about me
[35:54] praise the lord
[35:55] surely thou will slay the wicked o god
[35:58] depart from me therefore
[36:00] ye bloody men
[36:07] do not i hate them o lord that hate thee
[36:10] and m not i
[36:12] grieved with those that rise up against
[36:14] thee
[36:20] amen so it's not wrong to hate evil the
[36:22] bible says
[36:23] be angry and sin not a lot of people get
[36:26] angry and then they sin but the bible
[36:28] says be angry and send not here david
[36:30] said
[36:30] i hate them with the perfect hatred they
[36:33] are my enemies and then in verse 23 he
[36:35] says oh god
[36:36] search me o god and know my heart try me
[36:40] and know my ways and all together and
[36:43] see if there be
[36:44] any wicked way in me and lead me
[36:47] in the way everlasting amen

[59:10] amen praise the lord ecclesiastes
[59:14] chapter three
[59:15] i want to read this chapter some of the
[59:17] verses here
[59:18] ecclesiastes chapter 3. the bible says
[59:22] to everything there is a season
[59:23] and a time to every purpose under the
[59:25] heaven a time to be born a time to die
[59:29] a time to plant a time to pluck up that
[59:30] which is planted a time to kill
[59:33] a time to heal time to break down a time
[59:35] to build up
[59:37] there's a time to weep there's a time to
[59:39] laugh
[59:40] some people they just don't i just weep
[59:42] in time i'm just
[59:43] you know how's it saying lady it says
[59:45] they're poor wretched mind
[59:47] blind and miserable and you see some
[59:49] people they just get enough of god to be
[59:51] miserable and hateful and armory and
[59:53] do we have to do that and be a christian
[59:55] they're miserable but
[59:56] here the bible says there's a time to
[59:58] laugh and i think it says in another
[1:00:00] place the joy of the lord is our
[1:00:01] strength the david said
[1:00:03] lord restore unto me the joy of our
[1:00:05] salvation god bless you brother up in
[1:00:07] the balcony i don't know who you are but
[1:00:09] everybody look up there he's bouncing up
[1:00:10] and down something's happening in that
[1:00:12] brother's life and i guess it's only the
[1:00:13] second time he's been to church
[1:00:15] god bless you brother david said the joy
[1:00:17] of the lord is our strength
[1:00:19] and he got to a place the trials were so
[1:00:21] great he said lord restore
[1:00:22] to me the joy of my salvation some of us
[1:00:26] has lost the joy of
[1:00:27] our salvation and we're just going
[1:00:28] through the grind i tell you there's a
[1:00:30] place where the oil of the holy ghost
[1:00:32] can fill our lives
[1:00:33] amen and we say lord this is i enjoy
[1:00:36] this i enjoy
[1:00:37] church i enjoy god i enjoy the
[1:00:40] forgiveness of sins forgiven i enjoy the
[1:00:42] liberty the bible says where the spirit
[1:00:43] of the lord is there's liberty
[1:00:45] so if brother arnie takes off and starts
[1:00:47] running around this church you'll know
[1:00:48] wow he's got something
[1:00:50] give me what brother arnie's got he's
[1:00:53] back there smiling
[1:00:54] time to laugh a time to mourn time to
[1:00:58] dance
[1:00:58] time to cast away stones the time to
[1:01:00] gather stones together
[1:01:02] a time to embrace a time to refrain from
[1:01:04] embracing
[1:01:05] i like to preach a young people service
[1:01:07] right there there's a time to refrain
[1:01:08] from embracing and that's before you're
[1:01:10] married
[1:01:11] embracing other individuals of the
[1:01:14] opposite sex a time to get
[1:01:16] time to lose a time to keep a time to
[1:01:18] cast away a time to rend
[1:01:20] time to sow a time to keep silent there
[1:01:23] comes a time as a father you've got to
[1:01:25] speak
[1:01:26] you've got to say something time is a
[1:01:27] mother day's mother's time there's
[1:01:29] psalms mama says nope
[1:01:30] that's wrong we're not going to do that
[1:01:32] so the bible says there's a time a time
[1:01:34] to love
[1:01:35] a time to hate a time of war time of
[1:01:37] peace
[1:01:39] what shall it prof what prophet hath he
[1:01:41] that worketh in that wherein he laboreth
[1:01:43] i have seen the labor which god hath
[1:01:44] given to the sons of men to be
[1:01:46] exercised in it he hath made everything
[1:01:49] beautiful in his time
[1:01:51] also he has set the world in their heart
[1:01:52] so that no man can find out the work
[1:01:54] that god maketh from the beginning to
[1:01:56] the end go down to verse 14.
[1:01:58] i know that whatsoever god doeth it
[1:02:00] shall be forever nothing can be put to
[1:02:02] it
[1:02:03] nor anything taken from it and god doeth
[1:02:05] it
[1:02:06] that men should fear before him amen may
[1:02:09] god bless his reading of the word you
[1:02:10] may be seated
[1:02:12] praise the lord sometimes preachers just
[1:02:15] have to vent they kind of build this up
[1:02:17] kind of inside of them
[1:02:19] and i don't know if you ever had a
[1:02:20] thermostat stick on your radiator of
[1:02:22] your car
[1:02:24] you know but it and then it gets all
[1:02:25] that pressure and sometimes you just
[1:02:27] gotta vent it
[1:02:28] out and so you gotta vent it out in the
[1:02:30] right way
[1:02:32] i think i told you all about the big
[1:02:34] scar i have on my my arm right here i
[1:02:36] got a big scar
[1:02:37] people don't show their scars but i got
[1:02:39] a big scar on my wrist i was 17
[1:02:41] 18 19. i was up in vancouver visiting
[1:02:44] some friends and their car overheating
[1:02:46] you know i'm the hero and all the ladies
[1:02:48] and the guys around like hey
[1:02:49] and when i took it off and it sprayed up
[1:02:51] on my arm and in my face and
[1:02:53] so there was some malpractice they
[1:02:55] treated it wrong now i've got a big scar
[1:02:57] and it tells me don't vent in the wrong
[1:02:59] way some people they get under pressure
[1:03:01] in life
[1:03:02] pressure comes to everybody you know
[1:03:05] sometimes young people they get under
[1:03:06] pressure and they go drink and they
[1:03:08] do drugs or they may be living morally
[1:03:10] that's not the way to vent we have a way
[1:03:12] to let off pressure
[1:03:14] brother and preached the whole message
[1:03:16] he saw this days he preached a message
[1:03:17] called letting off the pressure
[1:03:19] letting off the pressure people it
[1:03:21] builds up and it builds up and it builds
[1:03:23] up
[1:03:24] i remember i was a 15 year old boy i was
[1:03:27] sitting in
[1:03:28] down in the basement in my brother's
[1:03:29] basement i was talking to my best friend
[1:03:31] jesse collins
[1:03:33] he was a diesel mechanic i knew he went
[1:03:35] to school and i said jesse what happens
[1:03:37] if this
[1:03:37] engine builds up if you know anything
[1:03:39] about compression engines and
[1:03:41] you know there's the piston comes up and
[1:03:43] the spark and the gas and
[1:03:45] diesel is just there's no spark plug it
[1:03:47] just comes up and the compression the
[1:03:48] heat and
[1:03:49] and then it explodes and pushes a piston
[1:03:51] down and so i was talking i said what
[1:03:53] happens if there and he went through
[1:03:54] this great scientific reason of
[1:03:56] what would happen i said and i was like
[1:03:59] you don't understand i am as a teenager
[1:04:00] i'm 15 years old and i'm under so much
[1:04:02] pressure and god began to deal with i
[1:04:04] mean it wasn't just a couple months
[1:04:06] later than a
[1:04:07] youth uh camp that i was sitting about
[1:04:09] where our brother here nathan is and
[1:04:11] they made a call and i got up and went
[1:04:13] down and i let off the pressure in jesus
[1:04:15] christ and
[1:04:16] gave it all to him say lord here's my
[1:04:18] life i've made a mess
[1:04:19] of my life and my testimony and when my
[1:04:22] teacher looked at me we went to a
[1:04:24] christian school you probably heard my
[1:04:25] testimony she
[1:04:26] said daniel you have the filthiest mouth
[1:04:28] in this christian school
[1:04:29] i thought oh god what a terrible
[1:04:31] testimony i have my father's a minister
[1:04:33] i've just made a mess of my life but
[1:04:36] you know i went to the altar and i laid
[1:04:39] it all down
[1:04:40] that's what altars are for they're
[1:04:41] places where living things die
[1:04:43] and i you know god just got to the place
[1:04:46] he said i'm sick and tired of lambs and
[1:04:48] goats and all this blood he said i don't
[1:04:49] want that i want a living sacrifice
[1:04:52] and i went down sister hannah and i laid
[1:04:54] my life down and said lord here's all of
[1:04:56] my life and i gave it to christ and he
[1:04:58] came in
[1:04:58] and i got up and i walked away a
[1:05:00] different person amen i went from the
[1:05:02] back row
[1:05:03] of just wanting to be a teenager and
[1:05:05] aloof i went up in a front lord i just
[1:05:08] want to
[1:05:08] be in your presence lord i want to be
[1:05:11] lord close to the flame of fire and
[1:05:13] i can hear my mom's voice speaking to me
[1:05:15] tonight i called her last night to wish
[1:05:17] her
[1:05:17] happy mother's day i haven't got to my
[1:05:20] first note on my page here but it's
[1:05:21] mother's
[1:05:22] day so i sit and talk to my mom and you
[1:05:25] know it's a mother
[1:05:26] it's amazing how a mother can shape your
[1:05:28] life she's probably watching today god
[1:05:30] bless you mom
[1:05:31] she doesn't they haven't been able to go
[1:05:33] to church in a long in over a year i
[1:05:35] guess their church and so she's
[1:05:36] streaming and so he said mom
[1:05:38] you can stream us today it's amazing
[1:05:40] there was a little book my mother had
[1:05:41] she said children
[1:05:42] are are wet cement
[1:05:46] and you mold them and shape them for a
[1:05:48] period of time and then that's all you
[1:05:49] have them and they're set for life
[1:05:51] the bible says train up a child in the
[1:05:53] way it should go and when he's old he'll
[1:05:55] not depart from it
[1:05:56] amen he might stray away from it a
[1:05:58] little bit but you've molded something
[1:06:00] in him so that's why you realize it's
[1:06:01] wet cement if any of you brothers any
[1:06:03] brothers ever poured concrete
[1:06:04] how many brothers we have yes we got
[1:06:06] some concrete so you pour that concrete
[1:06:08] and all of a sudden
[1:06:09] you get in a hurry like we got to get
[1:06:11] this done and we you get it all done and
[1:06:12] when you get done your little kid comes
[1:06:14] up puts his hand up here like
[1:06:15] puts his hand printed and oh we didn't
[1:06:17] wipe that out and there it is forever
[1:06:19] their hand print
[1:06:20] and those things make an impression in
[1:06:22] your life they
[1:06:23] they mold you and she had this little
[1:06:26] book so children are wet cement and it
[1:06:27] made an
[1:06:28] impression on me that young people
[1:06:29] they're there for a little time and you
[1:06:31] have an impression and then they grow
[1:06:32] older as the one man said arrows were
[1:06:35] never meant to stay in your quiver
[1:06:37] they're made to point in the right
[1:06:39] direction and shoot them and that's the
[1:06:40] way children are
[1:06:41] they uh oh this little girl shot love
[1:06:43] her we never had girls but i can imagine
[1:06:45] i'm going to keep this girl
[1:06:46] at home and then you know they get older
[1:06:48] and you know they're
[1:06:49] like you know and then maybe boys you're
[1:06:51] like you know i've got to point you and
[1:06:52] then i want you to go
[1:06:53] paul told timothy follow me as i follow
[1:06:56] christ
[1:06:57] it was imitation you follow me that's
[1:07:00] what parenting sometimes people they get
[1:07:01] to place they're telling their kids what
[1:07:03] to do is like
[1:07:03] instead of doing that say hey you just
[1:07:05] do what i do you just do what i do you
[1:07:07] respect the policeman and you do what's
[1:07:09] right you be responsible when
[1:07:11] sunday comes we go to church because
[1:07:13] they're gonna they're gonna do what you
[1:07:14] do you're
[1:07:15] where every one of us are preaching a
[1:07:16] gospel
[1:07:18] i remember one time is this okay this is
[1:07:20] just me this is kind of
[1:07:22] so i remember going in my basement i was
[1:07:24] like 17 18 years old and i
[1:07:26] preached i felt like there was a call in
[1:07:28] my life and i went down in our basement
[1:07:30] and i walked i remember walking in and
[1:07:33] my mom followed me in
[1:07:34] and i said mom i'm never going to preach
[1:07:37] again
[1:07:38] she said why daniel why why do you say
[1:07:39] that and i
[1:07:41] remember looking at her and i said you
[1:07:42] know what i've got some deep convictions
[1:07:44] in my heart about the bible and the word
[1:07:46] of god and
[1:07:47] and i just people don't want to hear
[1:07:49] that i don't i'm not going to do it
[1:07:51] and she looked at me and she shaped my
[1:07:53] life she said daniel that's what this
[1:07:55] world needs is men that have strong
[1:07:57] conviction
[1:07:58] and she made an impression on my life
[1:08:01] she molded me
[1:08:02] she shaped me and sometimes they shape
[1:08:05] you and maybe it's not for everybody but
[1:08:06] maybe it's just for me
[1:08:08] last night i was talking to her on the
[1:08:09] phone she had six children
[1:08:11] so she spent time in the nursery she
[1:08:13] said i spent that time in the nursery
[1:08:15] she said when i come out of that nursery
[1:08:17] she said i purposed in my heart that if
[1:08:18] i couldn't see the weight
[1:08:20] in the preacher's eyes she said i was
[1:08:21] sitting too far back
[1:08:24] so she said i had to see the white in
[1:08:25] the preacher's eyes and that was just
[1:08:26] her but it made an impression on me last
[1:08:28] night
[1:08:28] so you know now as a young person like i
[1:08:30] got to see the white in that preacher's
[1:08:32] eyes
[1:08:32] obviously brother branham's day there
[1:08:33] was 8 000 people in the congregation but
[1:08:36] she had a conviction in her heart she
[1:08:38] wanted to be close
[1:08:39] to where the minister was and that's the
[1:08:40] thing parents you're molding and shaping
[1:08:43] people's lives amen mothers and fathers
[1:08:46] alike we don't have father's day but
[1:08:48] god help us all going back to our
[1:08:50] subject here i just want to get started
[1:08:53] here and i want to read a quote brother
[1:08:54] and said you know we got to have a
[1:08:56] doctrine
[1:08:57] brother ham taught us he said you don't
[1:08:59] have a church without a doctrine
[1:09:00] every church has a doctrine and so we
[1:09:03] believe according to the scripture that
[1:09:04] god sent a message in this
[1:09:06] day malachi 4 says i'll send you elijah
[1:09:09] the prophet before the great and
[1:09:10] dreadful day of the lord so we believe
[1:09:12] god
[1:09:13] was going before he burnt the earth he
[1:09:15] was going to send
[1:09:16] elijah the prophet now he had two
[1:09:18] choices one i'll either strike the earth
[1:09:19] with a curse and destroy it like he did
[1:09:21] in noah's day
[1:09:22] or i'll send elijah the prophet jesus
[1:09:24] was concerned he said
[1:09:25] when the son of man cometh will he find
[1:09:27] faith so i believe it's what is it
[1:09:29] matthew 17 or matthew 11.
[1:09:31] the disciple says i thought elias was to
[1:09:34] come
[1:09:34] and jesus refers to william branham's
[1:09:36] ministry and says
[1:09:37] truly elias shall truly come
[1:09:40] and restore all things now he wasn't
[1:09:42] referring to john the baptist because if
[1:09:44] he had referred to john
[1:09:45] john the baptist and john the baptist
[1:09:47] was to restore he would have restored
[1:09:49] them back to the law of moses
[1:09:51] so jesus was they were talking to him
[1:09:53] about thinking it was john the baptist
[1:09:55] and jesus
[1:09:55] is saying future truly elias shall
[1:09:58] future he'll come
[1:10:00] and he'll restore all things jesus saw
[1:10:02] the church ages he saw it all fall he
[1:10:03] saw the dark ages he said i'm going to
[1:10:05] send you william branham's ministry
[1:10:07] and it's going to restore you back to
[1:10:09] the faith of our father so i say if
[1:10:10] jesus saw the ministry and
[1:10:12] acknowledgement
[1:10:13] how much more i should be able to see
[1:10:14] the ministry and acknowledge it
[1:10:16] and see what it does for my life and so
[1:10:18] i want to read this right here brother
[1:10:20] adam says and here we are down in the
[1:10:21] ladies in church age i love a prophet
[1:10:23] because he tells you where you are
[1:10:25] people they get in the world and they
[1:10:27] get lost like i don't know where we are
[1:10:28] it's the end of the world is this the
[1:10:29] beginning
[1:10:30] are the chinese it looks like the
[1:10:31] chinese are going to rule the world and
[1:10:33] it looks like they're building then they
[1:10:34] got armies and what they say you can
[1:10:36] name just doing the mass some of you are
[1:10:38] scientists you probably they said you
[1:10:40] can
[1:10:40] you can stand them for a breast and just
[1:10:42] march them into the ocean
[1:10:44] and the there's so many of them i don't
[1:10:46] know if it's 1.3 billion or 4 billion
[1:10:48] now
[1:10:48] that march them in the ocean they'll
[1:10:50] reproduce and you'll never run out of
[1:10:51] chinese
[1:10:53] and so it looks and if you watch the
[1:10:54] world or and watch how they're
[1:10:56] gaining dominance and things and like
[1:10:58] like that and so we had a prophet come
[1:11:00] in our day and he begins to talk about
[1:11:01] the roman catholic church is going to
[1:11:03] rule the world it's not going to be the
[1:11:04] chinese that rule the world we
[1:11:05] the roman catholic church is going to
[1:11:07] rule the world so you watch these
[1:11:08] players
[1:11:09] and we've lived long enough to see all
[1:11:10] these things coming to pass and see
[1:11:12] america go into debt
[1:11:14] and so a prophet comes and shows us the
[1:11:16] seven church ages in revelations chapter
[1:11:18] two
[1:11:18] and revelations chapter three these are
[1:11:20] things to help guide you through life
[1:11:22] we especially as men need to know
[1:11:24] because our children are going to come
[1:11:25] to us and no we're not going to
[1:11:27] it's not going to be a thousands and
[1:11:28] thousands of more years no
[1:11:30] right before the lord burns the earth
[1:11:32] with a and the earth is destroyed by
[1:11:34] fire we
[1:11:35] remember reading it over in peter hill
[1:11:37] the elements will melt like fervent heat
[1:11:40] so when you have a revelation of the
[1:11:41] scripture you don't put your whole life
[1:11:43] into becoming a millionaire and forsake
[1:11:45] god you remember
[1:11:46] amen that the bible says that the earth
[1:11:48] is going to burn with the fervent heat
[1:11:50] then we had a prophet come in our day
[1:11:51] had seven visions and every one of them
[1:11:53] come to pass
[1:11:54] we see them coming to pass we don't have
[1:11:55] time this morning to go through but the
[1:11:57] last one was america just in craters
[1:11:59] if you have a revelation of that it'll
[1:12:01] keep you from getting distracted and say
[1:12:03] oh how's the bible say six days shalt
[1:12:05] thou labor and the seventh day shalt
[1:12:07] thou rest
[1:12:07] it's the lord's day instead of working
[1:12:09] seven days if you go back in the book of
[1:12:11] um
[1:12:12] and study the romans and the jews the
[1:12:13] things that made romans romans and the
[1:12:15] jews were separated
[1:12:16] the jews would take a day and set it
[1:12:18] aside to rest where the romans they just
[1:12:20] work seven days a week
[1:12:21] so you see that culture coming today
[1:12:23] where the stores are now open
[1:12:24] seven days a week and there's no regard
[1:12:26] for god they just go on it's that roman
[1:12:29] spirit coming back in this day
[1:12:31] so now we have a prophet come goes to
[1:12:32] the book of revelations chapter 2 and
[1:12:34] chapter three
[1:12:35] and shows us that we're living in the
[1:12:37] last part of chapter three
[1:12:39] and the first verse of chapter four is
[1:12:41] come up higher which is the rapture
[1:12:43] so we're living right at the closing of
[1:12:46] the ladies and churches you said well
[1:12:47] how do you know it's
[1:12:48] the ladies in church age where we're
[1:12:50] living because the bible says thou art
[1:12:51] rich and increased with goods
[1:12:53] and have need of nothing have you ever
[1:12:55] seen in the history of the world where
[1:12:56] people are so rich
[1:12:58] and have need of nothing some of us
[1:13:01] think
[1:13:02] i need that other pair of shoes well
[1:13:03] what about those 15 that are in the
[1:13:05] closet that are right there
[1:13:06] you know when we were young you had play
[1:13:08] shoes and church shoes you had
[1:13:10] you had work play clothes and you had
[1:13:12] church clothes and that was you know and
[1:13:14] we were so blessed
[1:13:16] hey siri turn the temperature up hey
[1:13:19] siri uh
[1:13:20] turn the light out and we're so rich and
[1:13:22] increased with goods and haven't you
[1:13:24] and god said look you're wretched poor
[1:13:25] mind blind and miserable and you don't
[1:13:27] even know it
[1:13:28] brother and preach the message called
[1:13:30] and knoweth it not listen to the message
[1:13:31] if you're a young person listen to the
[1:13:32] message and knoweth it not brother ram
[1:13:34] talks about
[1:13:35] your body soul and spirit your triune
[1:13:37] being all these revelations of the
[1:13:39] prophet will help you identify
[1:13:40] where you are in the world history he'll
[1:13:42] go through and dissect you when you're
[1:13:44] tempted
[1:13:45] that's another sermon as well brother
[1:13:48] adam said this we're down at the ladies
[1:13:49] in church age and we're taught the lady
[1:13:51] in church aids that christ was put on
[1:13:53] the outside of his church
[1:13:55] and it was even knocking on the door
[1:13:57] trying to get back in and we see that
[1:13:59] happening
[1:13:59] and we we are we know the age that we're
[1:14:02] living in
[1:14:03] and now we're at the closing history of
[1:14:05] the world the world
[1:14:06] the book is now being finished the last
[1:14:09] line will be wrote across it someday and
[1:14:11] she'll be closed
[1:14:13] and time will be no more that's why we
[1:14:16] come to church to shake our minds away
[1:14:18] from the world
[1:14:20] shake our minds away from that young man
[1:14:22] that came to me that one day
[1:14:23] i think i did this illustration here a
[1:14:24] few weeks ago and that young man said
[1:14:26] i'm just going to walk away from god and
[1:14:28] i'm not going to
[1:14:29] serve the lord and when i get ready i'll
[1:14:31] come back
[1:14:32] and he was thinking that his desire for
[1:14:34] god was like this light switch i'm going
[1:14:35] to turn it off
[1:14:37] and when i get ready for god i'll turn
[1:14:39] it back on
[1:14:40] and we come to church to shake our minds
[1:14:42] and realize that jesus said no man comes
[1:14:45] to the father but by me
[1:14:47] it's not like hey i'm 16. i'm going to
[1:14:49] go do my thing when i get ready and i
[1:14:50] make a million dollars i'll be back when
[1:14:52] i'm 40 or 50.
[1:14:53] and the bible says we shake ourselves as
[1:14:55] young people shake yourselves from that
[1:14:57] jesus said i come in an hour that you
[1:14:59] think not when you don't think and you
[1:15:00] think authority and i'm going to come
[1:15:02] when
[1:15:02] at this age and so we shake ourselves
[1:15:04] from that and we
[1:15:05] shake away from the glitter and the
[1:15:06] glamour of the world because all of us
[1:15:08] are tempted every one of us have
[1:15:09] temptations
[1:15:10] you think well you're a 15 year old boy
[1:15:13] you're 18. i got these temptations mom
[1:15:14] and dad don't
[1:15:15] have any idea no mom and dad are tempted
[1:15:17] just like you it just changes
[1:15:20] every seven years you go through a
[1:15:21] change in your mind and your body
[1:15:23] and you say i don't believe that well
[1:15:25] you don't have to believe it but if
[1:15:26] you'll just practice it it'll help you
[1:15:27] when you get to those stained changes of
[1:15:29] your life
[1:15:30] and you realize that you go through a
[1:15:31] change but after when you're seven
[1:15:32] you're
[1:15:33] tempted to steal that cookie or steal
[1:15:35] something and you change in your 14 and
[1:15:36] then the boys and the girls and then you
[1:15:38] get
[1:15:38] 18 and then you get 21 and then you've
[1:15:40] got those kids you're like hey i'm just
[1:15:42] and i see sometimes parenting people
[1:15:45] have maybe a few children
[1:15:46] then they get their last one and they
[1:15:47] get tired and they kind of just check
[1:15:49] out
[1:15:50] they just like hey i'm down with this
[1:15:52] parenting and they kind of check out
[1:15:53] no no god gave them to us for a reason
[1:15:55] their responsibility
[1:15:57] i'd like to so many things you know i
[1:16:01] i i'm a minister that's not ashamed of
[1:16:04] where
[1:16:05] the the the things that have molded my
[1:16:08] life that i'm not ashamed to tell where
[1:16:10] i got them
[1:16:11] i see some ministers are ashamed they'll
[1:16:13] preach the message but they will not say
[1:16:15] i got this from william branham
[1:16:17] they're ashamed of many denominational
[1:16:19] people they'll preach the revelation of
[1:16:21] the message but they won't say hey i'm
[1:16:22] reading the messages of william branham
[1:16:24] and coming and preaching i'm not ashamed
[1:16:26] to say that i'm following a message that
[1:16:27] god sent by william branham
[1:16:29] and if you go back and read the message
[1:16:31] a man running from the presence of the
[1:16:33] lord and brother ram says
[1:16:34] now when you have children or we it's
[1:16:36] responsibility when you have those
[1:16:37] little children you get little
[1:16:39] fingerprints on the walls and you know
[1:16:42] you say i don't want those well that's
[1:16:43] the responsibility then you have a
[1:16:44] responsibility to raise them
[1:16:46] and to correct them and and educate them
[1:16:50] and so it's a responsibility and when
[1:16:52] you get married it's a responsibility
[1:16:53] some young men they get married and then
[1:16:55] they
[1:16:55] they want to go out and do all their
[1:16:58] hobbies and like well
[1:16:59] hey that you should have done that for
[1:17:00] you made a commitment to love honor and
[1:17:02] cherish and care about
[1:17:03] the way your wife feels or she's
[1:17:05] lonelier and then you and same with the
[1:17:06] wife you've got all these things and you
[1:17:08] make an obligation i promise to cherish
[1:17:10] and
[1:17:10] and value this it's getting really quiet
[1:17:12] in here but this is what pastors do all
[1:17:14] right
[1:17:15] evangelists run and scream and do all
[1:17:17] that but pastors just simple and talk
[1:17:18] and
[1:17:19] here i've got all these notes and the

[1:18:30] glorious time the men of all ages is
[1:18:32] long for this time the
[1:18:33] prophets of old long to see this hour
[1:18:35] but they wasn't privileged but we are
[1:18:37] privileged to live in this day
[1:18:39] we are privileged the darkest time
[1:18:42] there's never been a time where it's
[1:18:43] been more dark than
[1:18:44] this time isaiah said there'll be
[1:18:47] darkness on the earth and
[1:18:48] gross darkness on the people it'll be
[1:18:51] actually gross

[1:19:05] i'd love to live back there in that day
[1:19:07] and just you know get in the herd with

[1:19:14] god chose you every day brother edward
[1:19:16] you have to fight a battle
[1:19:17] greatest battle ever fought greatest
[1:19:19] battle ever fought how we read at second
[1:19:20] corinthians chapter 10
[1:19:22] casting down imagination when the
[1:19:23] devil's putting thoughts in your mind
[1:19:25] as we said now don't think of a pink
[1:19:26] elephant no you already thought about
[1:19:28] pink california
[1:19:30] because you can't control your thoughts
[1:19:32] the devil can put thoughts in your mind
[1:19:34] and that's
[1:19:34] you're sitting there trying to love the
[1:19:36] lord serve the lord ding a little text
[1:19:38] and then like go go go check your text
[1:19:39] go check your text
[1:19:40] and it's actually dopamine they say
[1:19:42] dopamine when you hear that ding
[1:19:43] and i can't preach that sermon the bible
[1:19:45] says that we are not ignorant of the
[1:19:46] devil's devices you go back and study
[1:19:48] facebook and they got people in the room
[1:19:49] and said how can we addict those people
[1:19:51] to their phones
[1:19:52] and they said we're gonna we're gonna
[1:19:53] pattern this just after the slot
[1:19:55] machines when you
[1:19:56] go to the gambling and they become
[1:19:57] addicted when they pull those slots down
[1:19:59] and ding i want something and they do
[1:20:00] the same thing with the facebook and it
[1:20:02] goes
[1:20:02] ding and they said it releases dopamine
[1:20:05] in your brain
[1:20:06] dopamine is more addictive than cocaine
[1:20:10] and now he's addicted all these people
[1:20:11] and people they love god a lot i want to
[1:20:13] say ding
[1:20:18] why can't you lay it down there's an
[1:20:19] addiction that comes with that and once
[1:20:21] you learn that like hey i'm gonna put
[1:20:22] that on silent i'm gonna talk to the
[1:20:24] creator
[1:20:25] lord help me i'm not ignorant of those
[1:20:27] devices i'm not gonna let that thing
[1:20:29] rule me
[1:20:30] i'm gonna put it in its place i'm not
[1:20:33] gonna
[1:20:33] let it rule over me and me become a
[1:20:35] master how do we read that the other day
[1:20:37] in corinthians he said
[1:20:38] yield your members as members of
[1:20:40] righteousness and not unto
[1:20:42] unrighteousness
[1:20:44] why would i let this little device come
[1:20:46] in and i become addicted to it
[1:20:47] and take me places that are bad and evil
[1:20:49] and i hear things that i wish i hadn't
[1:20:51] heard and i see things i wish i hadn't
[1:20:52] seen
[1:20:53] because of this device now i know
[1:20:56] preachers
[1:20:57] and then they say look you can't have
[1:20:58] facebook or you can't have a cell phone
[1:21:00] i don't think the bible says use the
[1:21:02] world but don't abuse it put it in its
[1:21:04] place
[1:21:08] lord help us today
[1:21:11] so much i would like to say but we're
[1:21:14] living in an age where the son of man
[1:21:15] ministry is
[1:21:16] coming our day luke 17 30 i was thinking
[1:21:19] of that scripture
[1:21:21] the bible says as it was in the days of
[1:21:24] sodom so shall it be luke 17
[1:21:28] 26 he says as it was in the days of noah
[1:21:31] so shall it be also in the day of son of
[1:21:33] man they did eat they drank they married
[1:21:36] wives
[1:21:36] they were given in marriage until the
[1:21:38] day that noah entered into the ark
[1:21:40] and the flood came and destroyed them
[1:21:42] all likewise also
[1:21:45] as it was in the days of lot they did
[1:21:46] eat they drank
[1:21:48] they bought they sold they planted
[1:21:50] building
[1:21:51] and build it and but the same day that
[1:21:53] lot went out of sodom it rained fire and
[1:21:56] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:21:57] all
[1:21:58] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:22:00] the son of man is revealed
[1:22:02] so what was going on in the days of
[1:22:04] sodom it was homosexuality
[1:22:07] you think homosexuality is going away
[1:22:08] not on your life
[1:22:10] it's prophesied remember they were going
[1:22:12] to legalize in one state
[1:22:13] and people like oh no texas has done it
[1:22:16] oh no i like hey
[1:22:17] get used to it's going to cover because
[1:22:18] it's prophesied all of sodom and
[1:22:20] gomorrah as it was in that day it's
[1:22:22] going to be in this day it's prophesied
[1:22:24] it's not going away
[1:22:26] so shall it be in the coming son of man
[1:22:28] when the son of man is revealed but what
[1:22:30] happened up on the hill
[1:22:31] in the days of lot abraham was sitting
[1:22:34] there remember the
[1:22:35] angel come elohim come and said you're
[1:22:37] going to bear a son
[1:22:38] and sarah laughed in the tent and the
[1:22:40] elohim said why did sarah laugh
[1:22:42] they called her out sarah why'd you
[1:22:43] laugh she said i didn't laugh he said oh
[1:22:44] but you did laugh you laughed in her
[1:22:46] heart wasn't an
[1:22:47] audible she laughed in her heart
[1:22:50] as it was in sodom so shall it be in
[1:22:52] this day remember
[1:22:53] jesus comes to the woman at the well and
[1:22:55] he's sitting on the well in the city of
[1:22:56] samaria said go get your husband she
[1:22:58] said i don't have a husband.
[1:22:59] he said you've said right you've had
[1:23:01] five the one you're living with now your
[1:23:02] sixth one
[1:23:04] is not yours but she said wait i know
[1:23:07] when the messiah comes he'll do what you
[1:23:09] just did messiah means the anointed one
[1:23:11] she said i know when the anointed one
[1:23:12] comes he'll do it
[1:23:13] he said i'm the one that's talking to
[1:23:15] you
[1:23:16] and so brother bam goes back and the
[1:23:17] angel comes to brother branham and says
[1:23:19] you're going to have a gift
[1:23:20] of discernment you'll know the thoughts
[1:23:21] and the intents of the heart then he
[1:23:22] takes them back to revelation
[1:23:24] or luke 17 30. as it was in that day
[1:23:27] it's going to be in this day and now we
[1:23:28] have 1200 tapes
[1:23:30] that you can listen to of the
[1:23:32] discernment of the son of man being
[1:23:34] revealed in our day and they'd stand up
[1:23:35] and they bring them around this side i
[1:23:37] keep doing this like this because
[1:23:38] brother ram said the angel of the lord
[1:23:39] is always on my right side
[1:23:41] he said that's why i bring the prayer
[1:23:42] line this way he said because the angel
[1:23:44] stands between me and those people
[1:23:46] and you can listen to it on the tape he
[1:23:47] said now you feel that presence that
[1:23:49] won't hurt you that's him that's
[1:23:50] standing between
[1:23:52] he said now that's a sweet humble tender
[1:23:54] presence
[1:23:56] and so we see we have 11 1200 tapes of
[1:23:58] that so he preaches a message
[1:24:00] recognizing your day and its message can
[1:24:02] we get through this doctrine will you
[1:24:03] bear with me a couple more
[1:24:05] minutes here brother man preaches a
[1:24:07] message anointed ones at the end time
[1:24:09] some of you maybe were raised in
[1:24:10] pentecost and they say look there's the
[1:24:12] holy spirit following that person she's
[1:24:13] speaking in tongues and running the
[1:24:15] aisles and
[1:24:15] i know that's the holy spirit maybe
[1:24:17] she's cut her hair and she's dressed in
[1:24:18] morally i know that's
[1:24:20] the prophet god said i know that
[1:24:21] stumbles you god showed him anointed
[1:24:22] ones at the end of time he preaches the
[1:24:23] whole message the rain falls on the just
[1:24:25] and the unjust
[1:24:26] on the wheat and the tares it falls in
[1:24:29] but what is the true evidence of the
[1:24:30] holy spirit is the life that you live
[1:24:33] by their life by their fruits you still
[1:24:36] know them
[1:24:37] so at the end of the message he comes
[1:24:38] down and this is really good this will
[1:24:40] help you because some people looked at
[1:24:41] the ministry of brother branham
[1:24:42] just like they did john the baptist
[1:24:44] remember they came to john said are you
[1:24:45] christ
[1:24:46] or do we look for another are you the
[1:24:48] one jesus said or john said no i'm just
[1:24:50] the voice of one crying in the
[1:24:51] wilderness i must decrease he must
[1:24:53] increase
[1:24:54] so when brother branham came in our day
[1:24:55] and had such a
[1:24:57] amazing ministry of the son of man that
[1:24:59] god gave to william
[1:25:00] it wasn't william brandon i want you to
[1:25:02] always remember this go back and watch
[1:25:03] deep calls the deep he's standing there
[1:25:04] he said i'm as helply as
[1:25:06] helpless as a baby unless he comes i
[1:25:09] i can't discern these people it was not
[1:25:11] william branham it was jesus christ
[1:25:13] borrowing a body
[1:25:14] and it was christ's ministry through him
[1:25:16] it's the same as the people getting up
[1:25:18] here singing a song or
[1:25:19] or or witnessing all of you all
[1:25:21] witnesses ain't you it's christ
[1:25:23] anointing your memory and then you do
[1:25:25] something for the lord and it wasn't
[1:25:26] william brandon it was jesus christ
[1:25:28] coming
[1:25:29] brother adam says this and he said i
[1:25:30] want you to know this for sure you that
[1:25:32] listen to this tape that you might know
[1:25:34] today that i was trying to say
[1:25:37] i was trying to say that about myself
[1:25:39] being that i was packing this message i
[1:25:42] have no more to do with it than nothing
[1:25:44] no more than just a voice some people
[1:25:48] try to make him god and here's william
[1:25:49] i'm saying look i'm just the voice i'm
[1:25:50] the microphone that this is flowing
[1:25:52] through
[1:25:54] and my voice even against my better
[1:25:55] judgment i wanted to be a trapper
[1:25:57] but he said it was the will of my father
[1:25:59] that i declare
[1:26:00] to do and i'm determined to do it i
[1:26:03] wasn't the one now listen
[1:26:05] how he he he changes right here he said
[1:26:08] i wasn't the one that appeared on the
[1:26:10] river
[1:26:10] i was only standing there when he
[1:26:12] appeared i'm not the one that performs
[1:26:14] these things and foretells things that
[1:26:16] happens as perfect as they are
[1:26:18] i'm only the one that's near when he
[1:26:20] does it
[1:26:21] isn't that what john was saying i must
[1:26:23] decrease it's him it's jesus christ
[1:26:25] and any ministry that doesn't point you
[1:26:27] to christ has got another
[1:26:29] uh objective and we want all of the
[1:26:32] ministry everything we do not to glorify
[1:26:34] man but to glorify jesus christ
[1:26:37] he said it wasn't what i knew he said
[1:26:39] it's what i just surrender myself to
[1:26:41] that he spoke through it wasn't me
[1:26:43] it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[1:26:45] the manifestation of the son of man
[1:26:48] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[1:26:50] the mystery that god unfolded
[1:26:51] it's not a man it's god it's the angel
[1:26:55] he said the angel was not the son of man
[1:26:57] he was the messenger from the son of man
[1:26:59] the son of man is christ
[1:27:01] he is the one you're feeding on you're
[1:27:03] not feeding on a man
[1:27:04] a man his words will fail but you're
[1:27:06] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:27:08] the son of man
[1:27:10] and then he makes this amazing statement
[1:27:12] he said if you haven't fed fully on
[1:27:14] every word to give yourself
[1:27:15] strength to fly above the denominations
[1:27:18] and the things of the world will you do
[1:27:20] it
[1:27:21] amen so he's bringing the people down to
[1:27:23] a challenge and i can tell you
[1:27:24] if you'll feed on the word of god's
[1:27:27] message in this day the son of man the
[1:27:28] things of the world will fade away from
[1:27:30] you
[1:27:31] the denominational idea even that comes
[1:27:33] into the message that will fade away
[1:27:34] from you
[1:27:35] and you realize that jesus christ loves
[1:27:37] you so much that he sent a message in
[1:27:38] this day
[1:27:40] all right done with the doctrine back to
[1:27:43] our text series
[1:27:44] ecclesiastes chapter 1. the bible says
[1:27:48] to everything there is a season
[1:27:50] i began to meditate on that yesterday
[1:27:52] brother lyle and i begin to think about
[1:27:54] the bible says to everything there is a
[1:27:56] season
[1:27:57] there is a season for this plex
[1:27:58] plexiglas there is a season for this
[1:28:01] speaker here there is a season for this
[1:28:04] microphone if you went back 20 years
[1:28:05] brother branham didn't necessarily have
[1:28:07] lapel mics there was a season and then
[1:28:09] technology changes and you discard it
[1:28:12] and so we find that everything has a
[1:28:14] seasons back home we have four seasons
[1:28:16] fall and winter and spring and summer
[1:28:19] and they go from one to the other we
[1:28:21] have a house it's just for a season
[1:28:23] you have children and they're just for a
[1:28:26] season how many of us would love to
[1:28:27] freeze our kids at 12 years old
[1:28:31] and they never went into those teenage
[1:28:32] years but you can't it's a season
[1:28:35] and then they move into that and
[1:28:36] chemicals kick into their mind and they
[1:28:38] become a different person and
[1:28:40] men young boys want to become men and
[1:28:42] start sparring and young ladies
[1:28:44] are concerned about their appearance and
[1:28:46] and things and it's a season that they
[1:28:48] go through
[1:28:48] it's not going to be forever they won't
[1:28:50] be teenagers forever you'll go through
[1:28:52] that and you'll come out the other side
[1:28:55] i had three boys and we made it through
[1:28:57] thank the lord you're changing diapers
[1:29:01] and you're in the nursery like oh i'm in
[1:29:02] the nursery
[1:29:03] it's just a season i see our sister in
[1:29:04] the back smiling it's a season you have
[1:29:06] to go through that season together
[1:29:09] you know you go through it i remember my
[1:29:10] wife when she got pregnant with one of
[1:29:12] our boys and
[1:29:13] the first one was really difficult she
[1:29:15] had a c-section and
[1:29:16] so the second one and then she got
[1:29:18] pregnant she came to me and said i'm not
[1:29:20] going to have this baby and i'd
[1:29:22] got a little wisdom after being married
[1:29:24] and i realized i would just agree with
[1:29:26] her
[1:29:27] you're right you don't have to have this
[1:29:29] baby you're right
[1:29:30] you don't have to have knowing that to
[1:29:32] everything there's a season
[1:29:34] within 10 months you're going to have
[1:29:35] this baby you're going to have this baby
[1:29:38] it's a season but you have to go through
[1:29:40] it
[1:29:40] most of our trials are when we have to
[1:29:42] change those seasons
[1:29:44] and we don't want to change seasons i'm
[1:29:47] going to say that again most of our
[1:29:48] trials is when we change
[1:29:50] seasons and we're not ready to change
[1:29:52] seasons
[1:29:53] so we're all young and it's as one man
[1:29:56] say it's a shame that youth is wasted on
[1:29:58] youth and you see people
[1:29:59] running and kids like man if i had that
[1:30:01] much energy i could do great things in
[1:30:03] the world
[1:30:04] but it's just youth and they're like
[1:30:06] stop playing stop playing no it's just
[1:30:07] something about a child they got to burn
[1:30:08] off that energy
[1:30:10] it's a stage and then they'll come up to
[1:30:11] the or they don't like i don't feel like
[1:30:13] doing that
[1:30:14] so y'all just smiling at me you know
[1:30:15] what i'm talking about
[1:30:17] and you have a season you know we read
[1:30:19] there further down there's a time to be
[1:30:20] born and there's a time to die
[1:30:23] it's appointed under man and we don't
[1:30:24] like to think about but as christians
[1:30:27] you know and and christianity is not all
[1:30:30] what are the some of the prosperity
[1:30:31] gospels you know i'm too blessed to be
[1:30:33] depressed i'm too anointed to be
[1:30:35] disappointed and
[1:30:36] sow a thousand dollar seed and god will
[1:30:38] bless you with a hundred thousand
[1:30:39] it's a gospel of prosperity and it's not
[1:30:42] real it's a gospel without a cross
[1:30:44] the gospel we preach has a cross a
[1:30:46] crucifixion a
[1:30:47] death to self and so so many people they
[1:30:51] sell christianity has no problems but
[1:30:53] life is real and the gospel came to
[1:30:56] bring us through life no matter what
[1:30:58] stage if we're 12 jesus was about his
[1:31:00] father's business as you go and
[1:31:01] become a young man and you worry about
[1:31:03] your career and amen you
[1:31:05] how they say with men they say i think
[1:31:07] it's um i think it's three minutes when
[1:31:09] you meet a man
[1:31:10] the average time is three minutes you
[1:31:12] you get through the weather and all that
[1:31:13] and you say hey what do you do for a
[1:31:14] living
[1:31:15] and a man's identity is created by what
[1:31:17] he does
[1:31:18] and and the bible tells us that a man
[1:31:21] should work and god told adam look go
[1:31:23] have dominion
[1:31:24] that's why if you're not a christian you
[1:31:25] don't know christ don't have a
[1:31:26] relationship with christ many times when
[1:31:28] you look at the world you
[1:31:29] and you don't have dominion the devil
[1:31:30] comes and he pushes you down you watch
[1:31:32] young people they come up in their
[1:31:33] senior year
[1:31:34] the pressure like a sliding board they
[1:31:36] come down and right at the end and they
[1:31:37] go out like where am i going to land and
[1:31:38] the devil comes in at times and there's
[1:31:40] alcohol and pressures and come on young
[1:31:42] men
[1:31:42] don't let the world the devil pull you
[1:31:44] out there somewhere come in the presence
[1:31:46] of the lord say lord help me
[1:31:47] the bible says commit your way unto the
[1:31:49] lord and he will direct your path
[1:31:52] the footsteps of the righteous they're
[1:31:53] ordered by god
[1:31:55] god has everything in his control he's
[1:31:57] leading us and guiding us every day
[1:31:59] things don't just happen by chance god's
[1:32:01] got it all in control
[1:32:03] oh if we would just get alone with god
[1:32:05] and pray and say lord i don't understand
[1:32:06] this
[1:32:07] i don't have it it's in my bible in
[1:32:08] their song he's got it all in control
[1:32:12] every road i walk down i know he's got a
[1:32:14] plan lord
[1:32:15] you're shaping me you're molding back at
[1:32:17] our church back home we have
[1:32:18] well you all have them here everyone
[1:32:20] those are probably man-made fabricated
[1:32:22] rocks and a mold
[1:32:23] but if you go out to regular rocks every
[1:32:25] rock is different
[1:32:27] and there's been conditions that
[1:32:29] happened in a per
[1:32:30] in a life to make that rock different
[1:32:34] and each one of us are different and god
[1:32:36] is shaping sister liliana
[1:32:38] differently than he's shaping sister
[1:32:40] heather and i think i'm a mother
[1:32:42] every time i see sister heather just
[1:32:44] that gentle nature
[1:32:46] and my daughter-in-law is named heather
[1:32:47] just a gentle nature each one of you
[1:32:49] have a character
[1:32:50] and no one can take your place god's
[1:32:53] made you different
[1:32:55] he's made us go through maybe some of
[1:32:56] you have been coveted through covet and
[1:32:58] maybe some of you haven't and so
[1:33:00] your life is different and you're going
[1:33:01] through just be a christian wherever you
[1:33:03] are just be a christian
[1:33:05] be a light say lord this is shaping me
[1:33:07] maybe you were born in your genetics
[1:33:09] your genes are weak and
[1:33:10] and you have a little illness you know
[1:33:13] or that don't don't discard your life or
[1:33:15] build a complex or go say look i can
[1:33:17] no in your weakness say remember paul he
[1:33:19] had his eyes he said i sought the lord
[1:33:21] three times
[1:33:22] that he would deliver and god said my
[1:33:23] strength is sufficient for you paul
[1:33:25] it'll keep you humble but look at how he
[1:33:27] changed the world by writing his letters
[1:33:29] and preaching the gospel
[1:33:30] may god help us everyone to say holy
[1:33:32] spirit empower me with our
[1:33:34] unique talents and abilities lord let me
[1:33:36] use my talents for the glory of god
[1:33:39] was it finney or one of them they'd
[1:33:40] listen to him say they did or went back
[1:33:42] and did a review said man the guy
[1:33:43] squeaks he's ball-headed he's ah
[1:33:45] look he's just nothing and he said but
[1:33:47] hey i'm winning souls for christ
[1:33:50] i'm winning souls for christ i say we do
[1:33:52] something for the lord jesus
[1:33:54] so i thought about this seasons changed
[1:33:57] from a boy to a man from a girl to a
[1:33:59] woman
[1:34:00] sometimes our health changes and we go
[1:34:02] through middle age
[1:34:04] i was thinking of this scripture back in
[1:34:05] the book of daniel
[1:34:07] in daniel chapter 2 verse 20. this is
[1:34:10] when daniel they were going to kill all
[1:34:11] the astrologers and daniel
[1:34:13] i'd like to preach a whole sermon right
[1:34:14] there when they come and say look we're
[1:34:15] going to kill you all
[1:34:16] the first thing daniel did he tried to
[1:34:18] buy time he said
[1:34:20] can you give us overnight and he tried
[1:34:21] to buy the second thing he got with the
[1:34:23] believers and the saints
[1:34:24] and he went to a prayer meeting we may
[1:34:26] need to know that someday
[1:34:28] always try to buy time when somebody
[1:34:30] forces you was talking to somebody
[1:34:31] yesterday and
[1:34:32] this has happened and this happened and
[1:34:33] this happened and this happened i said
[1:34:34] look just look let's just don't make
[1:34:36] decisions under pressure
[1:34:38] this is another pastoral thing never
[1:34:40] make a decision
[1:34:41] outside of the presence of the lord make
[1:34:44] all major decisions in the presence of
[1:34:46] the lord when we come down to the end of
[1:34:48] the service
[1:34:49] don't waste the time get down on your
[1:34:52] knees and pray say lord i have got to
[1:34:53] make a decision lord will you
[1:34:55] help me and only make major decisions in
[1:34:57] the presence of the lord
[1:34:58] how many young people if they would hear
[1:35:00] my voice
[1:35:02] and they say brother daniel said only
[1:35:03] make major decisions in the presence of
[1:35:05] the lord
[1:35:06] and it will save them from making a
[1:35:07] decision in the backseat of a car
[1:35:08] somewhere
[1:35:10] and they make decisions in the presence
[1:35:12] of the lord lord this is a righteous
[1:35:13] young man i think i'll take him to be my
[1:35:15] lord this is a godly sister i see the
[1:35:17] holy spirit in her life
[1:35:18] i'm going to make a decision in the
[1:35:20] presence of the lord so we come down
[1:35:22] here
[1:35:23] daniel chapter 2 and verse 20 and daniel
[1:35:28] answered and said blessed be the name of
[1:35:29] god forever and ever for wisdom
[1:35:31] and might are his oh the wisdom is in
[1:35:34] god
[1:35:35] what is it james the first chapter it
[1:35:36] says if any man lack wisdom let him
[1:35:38] ask of god i don't understand the world
[1:35:41] and the complexity well
[1:35:42] they used to say knowledge duplicates
[1:35:44] every five years
[1:35:46] uh with technologies and that's why the
[1:35:48] bible says in the last days knowledge
[1:35:50] shall increase
[1:35:50] it's fulfilling the scripture so
[1:35:52] everything you knew about machine work
[1:35:53] every five years it doubles and then it
[1:35:55] doubles now i think they say
[1:35:56] every year every that's why they have
[1:35:58] continuing education it doesn't matter
[1:35:59] if you're in nursing or what you're in
[1:36:01] the technology comes out and you have to
[1:36:02] go have continuing education
[1:36:04] because knowledge shall increase that
[1:36:05] will help every one of you and say look
[1:36:06] to keep your nursing
[1:36:08] license you got to go every two years
[1:36:09] and have these classes or this because
[1:36:11] knowledge
[1:36:12] see it as a scripture then the bible
[1:36:13] says knowledge shall increase the bible
[1:36:15] says if any man lack wisdom let him ask
[1:36:17] god
[1:36:18] don't get overwhelmed and just go down
[1:36:20] in depression say lord you help me lord
[1:36:21] i need wisdom
[1:36:23] god help me now i want you to notice
[1:36:25] that wisdom is different than knowledge
[1:36:27] okay wisdom is different than knowledge
[1:36:29] knowledge is information
[1:36:31] wisdom is to know how to apply that
[1:36:33] information
[1:36:35] so they tell me and i don't know
[1:36:36] everything about the fruits and
[1:36:37] vegetables but they tell me that
[1:36:40] that tomatoes are a fruit what is it
[1:36:42] whether you have seeds or something like
[1:36:44] that
[1:36:44] so if it's seeds it's a fruit so anyway
[1:36:48] knowledge tells me that tomatoes are
[1:36:50] fruit but
[1:36:51] wisdom tells me don't add a tomato to a
[1:36:54] fruit salad
[1:36:56] so i have the knowledge nope it's got
[1:36:58] seeds going in with the fruits
[1:37:00] but that wisdom tells me no no don't put
[1:37:02] that acidic tomato
[1:37:04] in with that fruit salad you'll ruin it
[1:37:06] so you see the world is full of
[1:37:07] knowledge
[1:37:08] but very little wisdom i'll say this the
[1:37:11] bible says
[1:37:12] the fear of the lord is the very
[1:37:14] beginning of wisdom
[1:37:16] what would it profit a man if he gained
[1:37:18] the whole world and he lost his soul
[1:37:21] it's not getting a lot of knowledge in
[1:37:23] making a career as a man but
[1:37:25] the beginning the wisdom of god amen the
[1:37:28] bible says the footsteps of the
[1:37:30] righteous are ordered by the lord this
[1:37:31] is the verse i wanted to get to verse 21
[1:37:34] and he god changes the times and the
[1:37:37] seasons
[1:37:39] oh sometimes when we go through trials
[1:37:41] as brother daniel said many times our
[1:37:42] trials
[1:37:43] are when god is just changing the
[1:37:45] seasons of life and we're going through
[1:37:46] changes and
[1:37:48] and the bible says that is god that
[1:37:50] changes the times and seasons he removes
[1:37:52] the kings and setteth up kings
[1:37:54] he giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[1:37:55] knowledge unto them that no
[1:37:57] understanding he revealeth the deep and
[1:37:59] secret things he knoweth what is in the
[1:38:01] darkness and the light dwelleth with him
[1:38:04] daniel goes on to pray and says i thank
[1:38:06] thee and praise thee o thou god of our
[1:38:08] fathers who has given me wisdom and
[1:38:09] might
[1:38:10] and has made known unto me now what we
[1:38:13] desired of thee for thou
[1:38:14] hast made known unto us the king's
[1:38:16] matter
[1:38:18] so the bible says god is the one that
[1:38:20] changes you might be going through a
[1:38:21] change maybe you're well one day and now
[1:38:23] you're sick
[1:38:24] and you're going through a different
[1:38:26] season we need to pray for joseph their
[1:38:28] whole family is going through a little
[1:38:29] season and
[1:38:30] telling how it changes where their beds
[1:38:31] are and trying to get him out and
[1:38:33] he can't walk he's in a wheelchair and
[1:38:35] he's going through a season but that's
[1:38:36] not the end it's just the season
[1:38:39] you're in darkness and it's night time
[1:38:41] you say oh it's nighttime but that it's
[1:38:42] just a season the sun will come up
[1:38:44] you just got to get through that that
[1:38:46] that dark season
[1:38:47] we've all been through those dark times
[1:38:48] in our life as long as you hold to
[1:38:50] christ don't let it bury you don't go
[1:38:51] out and
[1:38:52] and just stay with christ remember paul
[1:38:55] said they were going to abandon the ship
[1:38:56] and paul said stay with the shep
[1:38:58] stay with jesus christ amen may god help
[1:39:01] us because romans 8 28 says
[1:39:03] all things work together for good now
[1:39:06] the word of god is an
[1:39:07] anchor to the believer and your mind
[1:39:10] will start wandering you come
[1:39:12] go through seasons of your marriage you
[1:39:13] see people are engaged like oh we want
[1:39:15] to do a
[1:39:16] fairy tale it's like man it's coming
[1:39:18] life's coming at you
[1:39:20] it's real praise the lord it's good we
[1:39:22] got friends having get married in a
[1:39:23] couple weeks hey and you all laughing

[1:39:43] my wife she's like wonderful wife goes

[1:40:15] thin it cracked the side and it all
[1:40:17] flowed out the side of it and it's like

[1:40:48] to that
[1:40:49] there's got to be some guys there don't
[1:40:50] it's just a season
[1:40:52] that you're going through a season of
[1:40:54] your life this is something and the
[1:40:55] bible says to
[1:40:56] everything there's a season thank god
[1:40:59] for the word of god
[1:41:01] there's a time to be born and time to
[1:41:02] die i was thinking of this
[1:41:06] brother rem said this right through this
[1:41:08] room is coming color every color
[1:41:10] shirt dress whatever you got on is
[1:41:12] eternal
[1:41:13] laying right on records going around and
[1:41:15] around the world every time you bat your
[1:41:17] eye
[1:41:17] it's on record watch television will
[1:41:19] prove it then he says this amazing thing
[1:41:21] i want you to understand this is in 1935
[1:41:24] before the technology ever got there
[1:41:25] remember we read psalms 139 god knows
[1:41:27] your down settings your uprising he
[1:41:29] knows everything about you
[1:41:30] now prophet is coming in 1965 before
[1:41:32] this technology ever got here
[1:41:34] he said when you were born god sets a
[1:41:35] record on he didn't know how to say
[1:41:37] sd card and cameras and infrared
[1:41:40] lighting that even takes it in the
[1:41:42] in the dark he said he just said god
[1:41:43] puts a record on he said it don't make
[1:41:45] he said put a record on and it doesn't
[1:41:47] make much noise after a while you know
[1:41:48] and
[1:41:49] and that's a little baby till it comes
[1:41:51] to accountability then the noise starts
[1:41:53] he starts saying things listen to me
[1:41:55] young people
[1:41:56] he starts saying things and doing things
[1:41:58] that he has to answer for
[1:42:00] and when and when that life ends he said
[1:42:03] that record or that
[1:42:04] tape is taken off he didn't understand
[1:42:06] sd cards are you sticking in
[1:42:08] some of you have trail cameras we do
[1:42:09] back home and you track the deer and
[1:42:10] there's turkeys and there's a coyote and
[1:42:12] there's my neighbor and there's
[1:42:13] and you just pull the sd card brother
[1:42:14] and say that's what your life is when
[1:42:16] you start god puts
[1:42:17] something in a record he just had record
[1:42:19] players and he had a tape
[1:42:20] he didn't know what to call the
[1:42:21] technology but he's describing he's
[1:42:23] illustrating something that he's seeing
[1:42:26] he said there's a record there's a and
[1:42:27] he said and so he he said after your
[1:42:30] life ends it's taken off it's laid up in
[1:42:32] the great library of god now some of you
[1:42:34] have like uh
[1:42:35] now they you know i have um removable
[1:42:38] hard drives and i have it
[1:42:40] and i have it in my bag i accidentally
[1:42:41] stuck it in there it's got everything
[1:42:42] for my company and everything our life
[1:42:44] and pictures and all that stuff is
[1:42:45] laying in that cart
[1:42:47] in that little but now you have it in
[1:42:49] the cloud most of you put your data from
[1:42:51] don't even know where your pictures are
[1:42:52] they're just
[1:42:52] up there and i'm one of those old school
[1:42:54] guys like okay it's up there but i'm
[1:42:56] going to back it up so i own it
[1:42:57] you know because how many people i know
[1:42:58] my friend they changed their apple
[1:43:00] password
[1:43:01] and they lost all you know 20 000
[1:43:04] pictures of their kids through five
[1:43:05] years of their life so i'm like oh
[1:43:07] i want to own those we don't even know
[1:43:08] where that but we believe
[1:43:10] listen to me we believe it's there and
[1:43:13] the prophet of god is telling us look
[1:43:14] when you're
[1:43:15] born there's a record that's put on and
[1:43:17] god is recording everything that you
[1:43:18] wear
[1:43:19] your thoughts he said and now how are
[1:43:21] you going to get around it on judgment
[1:43:22] at the judgment bar when it's played
[1:43:24] right back you every move you made every
[1:43:26] thought
[1:43:27] that went through your mind so it
[1:43:30] behooves us as we
[1:43:31] have this little season maybe just at a
[1:43:33] little hour brother daniel's here
[1:43:34] preaching say
[1:43:35] lord you really are recording not only
[1:43:37] my actions everything i wore
[1:43:39] everything i said but not only that but
[1:43:41] my thoughts
[1:43:43] sometimes you go into mcdonald's and
[1:43:44] they have the thing they turn the volume
[1:43:45] down and they just have their words
[1:43:47] transcribed
[1:43:48] and that's the way your thoughts are
[1:43:50] brother said at the judgment you come in
[1:43:51] the great canopy of god and they're
[1:43:53] the people that saints will judge the
[1:43:54] earth and they bring them in and there's
[1:43:55] the great candle
[1:43:56] lord i never thought that i am i've been
[1:43:58] a good person
[1:44:00] everybody sit down for a minute hey get
[1:44:02] the get the card out of the rack
[1:44:04] they come over all i can relate it to is
[1:44:06] the sd cards and he puts it in the
[1:44:07] player
[1:44:08] i just and he plays it back just goes
[1:44:11] through
[1:44:12] there's that person there they are in
[1:44:13] church there they are and their thoughts
[1:44:15] are like oh it's a bunch of nonsense
[1:44:16] wish we were out here he's too hard to
[1:44:18] preach that's a bunch of i hate this
[1:44:19] place
[1:44:22] any judgment needed no depart from me
[1:44:24] you worker of iniquity
[1:44:26] you see how but aren't you so thankful
[1:44:28] that there's something in the bible says
[1:44:30] if we confess our sins
[1:44:32] he's faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:44:34] our sins and cleanse us from
[1:44:36] all i love the word all all
[1:44:38] unrighteousness
[1:44:39] so there's going to be blank spots on
[1:44:41] the tapes of the redeemed because they
[1:44:43] confess those little spots and god wipes
[1:44:45] the tape out
[1:44:46] oh blessed be the name of jesus aren't
[1:44:49] you thankful for the blood of jesus
[1:44:50] christ
[1:44:51] amen so the prophet of god is telling us
[1:44:53] look those tapes are there but the bible
[1:44:55] says that the blood of jesus christ
[1:44:56] cleanses us from those sins
[1:44:59] they line them up i think it was brother
[1:45:00] borders might have been brother perry
[1:45:01] green came to brother branham said
[1:45:02] brother branham
[1:45:03] do you see everything in those people's
[1:45:05] lives that come up
[1:45:07] brotherhood said you know if they've
[1:45:08] confessed and it's under the blood i
[1:45:09] can't even see it
[1:45:11] god can't show it to me because god
[1:45:13] doesn't even know about oh that ought to
[1:45:15] just make us get
[1:45:16] up and run around and say blessed be the
[1:45:17] name of the lord i'm going to confess my
[1:45:19] sins lord i want them to
[1:45:20] be cleansed and erased from that great
[1:45:23] amen that
[1:45:24] that great tape that god has on that day
[1:45:26] amen
[1:45:28] so many things here i don't know how to
[1:45:31] get through it all i don't want to get
[1:45:32] through at all because i've been trying
[1:45:34] to be better
[1:45:35] i try to get better try to get better
[1:45:37] i've been trying to preach shorter
[1:45:40] but i thought about mother's day you
[1:45:43] know they're the first one that holds
[1:45:44] you
[1:45:46] first one to love you we should never
[1:45:49] ever disrespect our mother she held us
[1:45:52] under her heart for nine months before
[1:45:54] you breathed your first breath
[1:45:56] she was watching what going down the
[1:45:58] stairs with her baby
[1:46:00] she didn't want to trip because she was
[1:46:01] protecting you
[1:46:03] as teenagers we should never get in a
[1:46:05] place the chemicals kick in our mind
[1:46:07] that we would ever dis
[1:46:08] disrespect mom your mom say amen
[1:46:13] preach brother daniel and lower your
[1:46:14] voice when you do it but let it sink
[1:46:16] into these teenagers
[1:46:18] you should always the bible says i tell
[1:46:20] young people to say if you want to be a
[1:46:22] christian
[1:46:23] the evidence is you believe the word of
[1:46:24] god in ephesians 6 1 says children obey
[1:46:27] your parents in the lord
[1:46:28] don't ever call yourself a christian if
[1:46:30] you don't obey mom and dad
[1:46:32] and then mom and dad it behooves us to
[1:46:34] not make
[1:46:35] ridiculous rules for our children at 20
[1:46:39] years old that they got to be in bed at
[1:46:40] 8 o'clock at night
[1:46:42] the bible says provoke not your children
[1:46:44] to wrath and so we grow up together as a
[1:46:46] family you go through
[1:46:48] sicknesses and good times and bad times
[1:46:50] you go through them together
[1:46:51] that's what happens somebody goes
[1:46:52] through a season and then adolph no we
[1:46:54] go through those things together
[1:46:57] as a church sometimes we go through we
[1:46:59] go through it together iron sharpened
[1:47:00] with iron well brother daniel i don't
[1:47:02] agree with that oh don't just do that
[1:47:03] wait just stick around you'll understand
[1:47:06] a little bit just
[1:47:07] talk you know let's talk through this
[1:47:10] sometimes you're misunderstood i was
[1:47:13] thinking about that because the bible
[1:47:14] says the scripture was written by holy
[1:47:16] men of god were moved by the holy ghost
[1:47:19] and then i was reading in second peter
[1:47:20] chapter three it talks about holy women
[1:47:23] so if holy men of god can be moved by
[1:47:25] the holy ghost and write the bible
[1:47:27] can't holy women be moved by the holy
[1:47:29] ghost
[1:47:31] and write and then script and change
[1:47:34] i was reading that this morning brother
[1:47:35] ram said the first preacher that ever
[1:47:38] gets a child is mother
[1:47:40] said there's five gospels matthew mark
[1:47:41] luke john
[1:47:43] and a mother should be a spirit-filled
[1:47:45] woman who can teach her children and
[1:47:47] teach them to pray
[1:47:48] and to know about god and so forth he
[1:47:51] said it's too bad that moms don't care
[1:47:53] about their children today and tell them
[1:47:55] bible stories he said it's hard to get a
[1:47:56] preacher that'll do that let alone a
[1:47:58] mother
[1:47:59] and he said if mothers would take more
[1:48:01] time to talk to their children about god
[1:48:03] and to pray
[1:48:04] for them we would have less juvenile
[1:48:06] delinquency
[1:48:07] he said first of all it's parent
[1:48:08] delinquency before we get juvenile
[1:48:10] delinquency
[1:48:11] if it said if mothers would take their
[1:48:13] their place in the home in the bible and
[1:48:15] pray for their children and lead them to
[1:48:17] christ
[1:48:18] he goes on to say i was listening to
[1:48:19] message mother's day it's
[1:48:21] just a really short message you said a
[1:48:23] child would listen to its mother
[1:48:25] he said some little touch about that
[1:48:27] mother and that child will listen to
[1:48:29] and when it's hurt it'll go to mother
[1:48:32] for consolation before it'll go to
[1:48:33] father
[1:48:34] oh i know that's true i got three boys
[1:48:36] they fall down and skin their knees
[1:48:38] blood right now like come on wipe it off
[1:48:39] we got to get this done
[1:48:41] right no they go to mama
[1:48:44] or their aaron's laughing over there i
[1:48:46] never had daughters so i don't i don't
[1:48:48] understand
[1:48:49] a lot of that but i'm learning you know
[1:48:52] and
[1:48:54] god help us all but it's a mother
[1:48:59] and he goes on to say because she was
[1:49:01] the first
[1:49:02] with it you know and there's some gift
[1:49:04] that god gives to a mother it's a gift
[1:49:05] that a man doesn't have and
[1:49:07] the world they want to make gender
[1:49:09] neutral and make everything neutral and
[1:49:11] all the same
[1:49:12] and you can take your right hand your
[1:49:13] left hand they look the same but they're
[1:49:14] different
[1:49:15] god made a man and a woman he made him
[1:49:17] different he gave gifts to a woman that
[1:49:19] a man could never
[1:49:20] ever achieve it's a special gift
[1:49:23] he goes on to say mother's day he said
[1:49:25] it's a racket they made a lot of money
[1:49:26] and flowers out of it but mother's day
[1:49:28] should be every day
[1:49:30] every day not just hey i'll send mom
[1:49:32] some flowers no
[1:49:33] we're gonna say to do more to sit down
[1:49:35] and talk to her
[1:49:36] call her on the phone say mom i love you
[1:49:38] thank you for every whipping you gave me
[1:49:41] i remember the one day my brother was
[1:49:42] two years old and he climbed up the
[1:49:44] stairs me and my brother slammed the
[1:49:45] door and
[1:49:46] hit him and he rolled all the way down
[1:49:47] the stairs she took us in there and
[1:49:50] she lined us up she said pull your
[1:49:51] trousers down i'm gonna whip you i said
[1:49:53] dad doesn't do it like this
[1:49:55] she said but i'm doing it like this and
[1:49:58] she made a
[1:49:59] an effect on my life mom has an effect
[1:50:04] brotherham said they're little treasures
[1:50:06] that god has given you the
[1:50:07] responsibility of raising
[1:50:09] and i always said and made this kind of
[1:50:10] saying we know that written gospels
[1:50:12] matthew mark luke and john but there is
[1:50:14] a fifth gospel unwritten and that's
[1:50:16] mother
[1:50:17] she gets them before matthew mark luke
[1:50:19] and john's teaching gets him
[1:50:20] so the responsibility is placed upon you
[1:50:23] mothers and you fathers to raise these
[1:50:25] children for a kingdom of god
[1:50:28] i woke up really early this morning went
[1:50:30] to bed late and woke up around five
[1:50:32] something my friend had texted me
[1:50:35] a minister and he sent me this quote he
[1:50:37] said a good praying mother
[1:50:39] or wife can do more for the kingdom of
[1:50:42] god on her knees at home
[1:50:43] than sometimes a preacher can do on the
[1:50:46] platform
[1:50:49] a praying wife or mother can do more for
[1:50:51] the kingdom of god on her knees at home
[1:50:53] than sometimes a preacher can do on the
[1:50:55] platform
[1:50:56] amen so there's something that you can
[1:50:58] do as a mom that the preacher can't do
[1:51:00] that the pastor can't do
[1:51:01] you can do it as a mom talking about
[1:51:05] seasons i just
[1:51:07] you know i was talking about sometimes
[1:51:10] brother perry green came here when he
[1:51:11] was 30 something years old and had a
[1:51:13] church and maybe
[1:51:14] many of you all went here and had him as
[1:51:16] a pastor and he thought this is going to
[1:51:17] be forever
[1:51:19] and now we realize that was just a
[1:51:20] season
[1:51:22] my friends grew up and brother branham
[1:51:24] was there and they said you know
[1:51:25] people believed him as god because you
[1:51:27] never had a problem whenever problem you
[1:51:28] had you just called brother branham and
[1:51:30] he prayed and your problem went away my
[1:51:32] father-in-law dallas you can hear it on
[1:51:34] the tape he
[1:51:34] run a stick through his ear he's
[1:51:36] squirrel hunt run a stick to his ear and
[1:51:37] bled a whole pillow
[1:51:38] of blood out in his ear he went to the
[1:51:40] doctor said your ear blends
[1:51:42] ear drums bursts so they called brother
[1:51:45] branham and brother branham just prayed
[1:51:46] said dallas your ears going to be all
[1:51:48] right he goes back to the doctor and his
[1:51:49] ear was completely here
[1:51:50] he healed his eardrum was healed he said
[1:51:52] we just our problems we just
[1:51:54] you know and we thought brother iran
[1:51:55] would be us forever and then they
[1:51:56] brother god took brother branham
[1:51:58] so that you would have faith will he
[1:52:00] find faith he delivered a message that
[1:52:02] all things are possible now you believe
[1:52:04] you pray you ask god
[1:52:07] and so i was thinking about that was
[1:52:08] just a season and sometimes
[1:52:10] you know we think about you know a
[1:52:12] season and and uh
[1:52:13] a time and you know we've talked about
[1:52:16] us being here for a time and a season
[1:52:18] and
[1:52:19] you know to bear one another's burdens
[1:52:21] and that's always been my burden is for
[1:52:23] the souls of people have one
[1:52:24] motive is that people would draw closer
[1:52:27] to jesus christ
[1:52:29] and i just you can see that my motive
[1:52:31] has been that
[1:52:32] that to draw people to closer to god or
[1:52:34] do whatever we can to draw people closer
[1:52:36] to god if we have a
[1:52:37] youth activity we come together and we
[1:52:39] read the bible and pray and
[1:52:40] conviction of the holy spirit and little
[1:52:42] nathan is there and in that conviction
[1:52:44] he gives
[1:52:44] his heart to the lord a few weeks later
[1:52:46] brother arnie baptizes him whatever we
[1:52:48] do is for the kingdom of god
[1:52:50] and i don't want to change my burden
[1:52:52] many churches are losing their
[1:52:54] identification
[1:52:56] they're changing their vision and it's
[1:52:59] about
[1:52:59] sports and activities and they build a
[1:53:02] a social club and a clan and they lose
[1:53:05] their original purpose of
[1:53:07] challenging people if they're ready to
[1:53:08] meet the lord jesus christ
[1:53:12] and not everybody wants a pastor
[1:53:15] and some people in this room maybe never
[1:53:16] had a pastor
[1:53:18] and i've said in the five-fold ministry
[1:53:20] people are changing the five-fold
[1:53:22] ministry
[1:53:22] to be apostle and prophet and
[1:53:25] evangelists
[1:53:26] and it was pastor and then teacher and
[1:53:28] they've changed the
[1:53:30] the p for pastor and they changed it to
[1:53:32] orator
[1:53:33] i want an orator i want to go to church
[1:53:35] once a week and i want somebody to
[1:53:37] deliver
[1:53:38] an oration to me and i want to leave and
[1:53:40] go home
[1:53:42] and so they think they have a pastor but
[1:53:43] they don't they have an orator
[1:53:45] and they're happy with the orator but a
[1:53:47] pastor is a shepherd
[1:53:49] like a father in the family paul talks
[1:53:51] about being a father in the gospel a
[1:53:53] shepherd
[1:53:54] of a soul to move a person from
[1:53:57] as they're on this journey to make it to
[1:53:58] a rapture so if we change that to an
[1:54:01] orator and we're just all together we're
[1:54:02] building a clan we're all coming
[1:54:04] together we feel good and say hey
[1:54:05] everybody's the bride and i get a better
[1:54:06] ship
[1:54:06] we're the bride we're the bride we're
[1:54:08] hallelujah we're the bride we're the
[1:54:10] bride and we all shout run the aisles
[1:54:11] we're the bride
[1:54:13] and then a real pastor says now wait a
[1:54:14] minute wait a minute you can say you're
[1:54:16] a brain surgeon
[1:54:18] but they have a whole if you say i want
[1:54:19] to go to school some of you have gone
[1:54:20] through nursing and you've done that
[1:54:22] and they they used to bring a whole set
[1:54:23] of books out now they probably said hey
[1:54:25] here's all the classes online
[1:54:26] but they stack a whole set of books down
[1:54:28] and they're this tall
[1:54:30] i say this this content is what makes
[1:54:33] you a brain surgeon
[1:54:34] you have to go through the books retain
[1:54:38] the information
[1:54:39] actually become the information and when
[1:54:41] you do that you're a brain surgeon
[1:54:44] so an orator just says we're the bride
[1:54:46] we're the bride i got all the quotes i
[1:54:47] got the message 12
[1:54:48] minutes we're the bride but a pastor
[1:54:50] comes along and said look
[1:54:51] if you're the bride the bible says the
[1:54:53] bride made herself ready you have to go
[1:54:55] through the content
[1:54:56] become the content to be the bride
[1:55:00] is that fair to say so you can see how
[1:55:02] everybody wants an orator that just
[1:55:03] screams worth of bride as opposed to
[1:55:05] somebody says
[1:55:06] if you're a brain surgeon you'll go
[1:55:07] through the books become the content of
[1:55:09] the books
[1:55:09] remember john what is it 10 7 he took
[1:55:12] the book and gave it to john and he ate
[1:55:14] it the type of the bride it was sweet to
[1:55:16] his mouth i'm the bride
[1:55:17] but it was bitter in his belly it was
[1:55:20] bitter in his belly to say okay if
[1:55:22] you're the bride
[1:55:23] as young boy and girl getting married
[1:55:26] there's such a passion to be with the
[1:55:28] one they're going to marry
[1:55:29] they love him you write them a letter i
[1:55:31] want to open it
[1:55:32] i want to read it i want to what did he
[1:55:34] mean here what did he mean what
[1:55:35] i'm just so fascinated and then we have
[1:55:37] the bible and people don't even care
[1:55:39] about the word of god
[1:55:41] don't even care about being in the
[1:55:42] presence of god and in the church of god
[1:55:44] how can you be the bride and you love
[1:55:45] the world and the things of the world
[1:55:47] more than you love jesus christ
[1:55:49] so that's why we come to church and we
[1:55:50] check ourselves and there's a shepherd
[1:55:52] say
[1:55:52] are you really we say we're a brain
[1:55:55] surgeon but are you have you really gone
[1:55:56] through the books and become the books
[1:55:58] we say we're the bride but have we gone
[1:56:00] through the book
[1:56:01] and become the content of the book
[1:56:06] brother ram said this he said we he
[1:56:08] christ should be the principle theme of
[1:56:10] our talking
[1:56:11] of our thinking of our singing of our
[1:56:14] talks
[1:56:14] he should be the principal theme of our
[1:56:17] life
[1:56:18] if he's the principle theme of the bible
[1:56:19] and the bible's in us then he should be
[1:56:21] the principle theme of everything we do
[1:56:23] we say we think should be christ
[1:56:27] i know we get together we have kids
[1:56:29] we're cutting you all don't catch your
[1:56:30] grass
[1:56:31] you throw those rocks out there in the
[1:56:32] landscaping i love it i hate
[1:56:34] grass i hate weeds and see this grass
[1:56:37] and your landscaping just
[1:56:38] rocks and big rocks and little rocks and
[1:56:39] brown that's my kind of landscaping i
[1:56:42] like that
[1:56:43] and we all have those things in life and
[1:56:45] school and bills and troubles and that
[1:56:46] but the principle theme of
[1:56:48] all of that is jesus christ we all have
[1:56:51] to
[1:56:51] you know as the bible say we were
[1:56:53] reading it the other day in the bible i
[1:56:54] think it might be on
[1:56:55] ecclesiastes what comes to the animal
[1:56:57] comes to the human and that's right
[1:56:59] one dies and they all go to the grave
[1:57:00] but there's something greater than that
[1:57:02] we were made in the image of god we have
[1:57:03] a greater task
[1:57:05] than just raising children feeding them
[1:57:07] that's what animals do there's something
[1:57:09] greater than that as sons and daughters
[1:57:11] of god especially christians
[1:57:13] the world they just they show that their
[1:57:14] serpents see that's all they worry about
[1:57:16] is the animalistic but there's a
[1:57:18] christians made in the image of god they
[1:57:19] realize there is a purpose for them in
[1:57:21] life
[1:57:21] and we read it over there was the
[1:57:23] colossians on wednesday night how that
[1:57:25] he said that he wants to have a
[1:57:26] preeminence in a people he wants to be
[1:57:29] the primary thing of your thought now
[1:57:30] this isn't for everybody
[1:57:32] that's why this message isn't i can't
[1:57:34] see it i don't expect people to see it
[1:57:36] lot couldn't see what what abraham was
[1:57:38] saying but there was something abraham
[1:57:39] was up there was with
[1:57:40] the son of man ministry being revealed
[1:57:42] in his day and there's a people that are
[1:57:43] called to be the bride of christ i
[1:57:45] believe i'm going to believe that
[1:57:46] everyone in this room is called to be
[1:57:47] the bread of christ
[1:57:48] because something has drawn you here
[1:57:50] today the bible says no man can come
[1:57:52] except the father draws him and
[1:57:54] something
[1:57:54] knocked on your heart this morning and
[1:57:56] said get out of bed and go to church
[1:57:58] the bible says that that's not natural
[1:58:00] that's supernatural
[1:58:02] amen that god would deal with your heart
[1:58:04] amos and you'd obey your mama and you'd
[1:58:06] come to church and ride in a van and god
[1:58:08] would do something and amos says maybe
[1:58:09] he's like amos in the bible and he'll
[1:58:11] just be a a prophet of god he'd prophesy
[1:58:13] the coming of the lord and and each one
[1:58:15] of us i'm going to believe that god is
[1:58:16] dealing with our hearts
[1:58:18] and we're going through seasons each one
[1:58:20] of us going through seasons
[1:58:22] amen there's more here but we better
[1:58:25] save that for another service
[1:58:27] i'll turn that upside down 50 musicians
[1:58:30] will come that's the only way to get me
[1:58:31] to stop
[1:58:33] brother ram said this he preaches the
[1:58:35] message how can i overcome
[1:58:36] he said now i chose this because that i
[1:58:39] think that it's a time that we should
[1:58:41] never let the spirit of revival die
[1:58:45] and we're living in a time where they
[1:58:47] asked for the random brother and why
[1:58:48] can't i pray he said the revival is over
[1:58:49] and then the prophet of god said the way
[1:58:50] to overcome
[1:58:51] is keep the spirit of revival inside of
[1:58:54] you
[1:58:54] and if you've been camping and you burn
[1:58:56] it and it gets burnt down a little bit
[1:58:58] and the logs and it starts going out
[1:58:59] how do you create a revival brother
[1:59:01] david you just push those logs back
[1:59:03] together
[1:59:04] you push them together and it creates
[1:59:05] another revival and a great fire
[1:59:08] brother man says we've got to keep in
[1:59:09] revival constantly revived
[1:59:11] every day paul said that he had to die
[1:59:14] daily that christ might live and he said
[1:59:15] we must never
[1:59:17] say must never must never
[1:59:21] we daniel andes you must never let the
[1:59:24] spirit of revival
[1:59:26] die within us amen i say lord don't let
[1:59:29] me let the spirit of revival die so if
[1:59:31] you see me crying and lifting my hands
[1:59:32] or running the aisles or doing something
[1:59:34] like what are you doing
[1:59:35] i'm trying to keep the revival inside me
[1:59:37] i'm trying to keep the spirit revived
[1:59:39] inside of me i know the spirit of the
[1:59:41] world is ladies and
[1:59:42] to just roll over and become cool and
[1:59:44] and so i'm keeping the
[1:59:46] the logs together as we'd say i'm
[1:59:48] keeping the believers together and it's
[1:59:49] the same with the holy ghost
[1:59:50] on the day of pentecost who was it was
[1:59:52] standing here was talking about
[1:59:54] i was somewhere and they were talking
[1:59:55] about little licks of fire coming down
[1:59:57] on the individuals
[1:59:58] and when they they went out and
[1:59:59] witnessed but when you come together
[2:00:00] that's what church is
[2:00:02] it revives you you push those holy
[2:00:04] spirits together now you have a bonfire
[2:00:06] of believers that come together that
[2:00:07] renew our strength
[2:00:10] how's the bible say they that wade upon
[2:00:12] the lord shall renew their strength
[2:00:13] they'll mount up with wings as an
[2:00:15] eagle amen may god help us let's bow our
[2:00:19] heads together
[2:00:21] heavenly father lord i've delivered
[2:00:23] what's been on my heart today father
[2:00:25] lord i have many many
[2:00:27] notes here but i pray god that you would
[2:00:30] just take the words that have been
[2:00:31] spoken the burden
[2:00:32] on my heart little experiences that i've
[2:00:36] been through with life
[2:00:37] godly mother godly father little stories
[2:00:41] lord and i pray that you would tuck them
[2:00:42] deep in our hearts
[2:00:44] or maybe there's a young person going
[2:00:45] through a season of their life
[2:00:47] they can't understand their life is
[2:00:50] changing their mind is changing their
[2:00:52] body is changing
[2:00:54] maybe someone else in the middle of
[2:00:56] their life and
[2:00:58] things are changing in their mind and
[2:00:59] their body i say brother daniel i
[2:01:02] understand what you're saying i
[2:01:03] i you're explaining to me what's
[2:01:06] happening in my life and in my mind
[2:01:09] maybe we're older lord and we're getting
[2:01:11] an ache and a pain and we go through a
[2:01:13] sickness and you heal us and maybe we
[2:01:15] don't come back as strong as we used to
[2:01:17] be

[2:01:21] i pray you would strengthen us today you
[2:01:22] would help us
[2:01:24] lord we look at the scripture
[2:01:25] ecclesiastes chapter 3
