[53:20] forever and we thank you for the lord
[53:22] in jesus christ's name amen
[53:26] good to love the lord you may be seated
[53:32] i know the storm went through yesterday
[53:34] and
[53:35] hit parts of town pretty hard and
[53:39] they called my son-in-law amos out in
[53:41] the middle of the storm to go out
[53:43] and do repairs and things so we were
[53:45] praying for him
[53:46] the lord would keep him safe and even
[53:49] all of those that
[53:51] would have to respond the medical and
[53:53] and the safety and all
[53:55] things that we take for granted until we
[53:57] need it
[53:58] but let's remember all those who
[54:00] literally will go out
[54:02] and put their life in danger for us so
[54:04] appreciate that so
[54:06] this morning if you had the whatsapp
[54:09] announcement you saw it
[54:11] brother matt watkins is with us this
[54:13] morning
[54:15] we had a chance to talk with him
[54:17] recently and just
[54:19] he had called me and said i could come
[54:22] out minister if if he so desired so
[54:25] we had if the lord led him to come that
[54:27] way would be all right so
[54:29] it worked out and contacted me on
[54:31] thursday and said
[54:33] we're going to try to come this weekend
[54:35] but then that hurricane was coming
[54:37] through
[54:38] and then there was no contact for a day
[54:40] and a half until he finally said i'm
[54:42] sorry he said we're running around
[54:43] trying to get everybody's generators
[54:45] hooked up getting prepared for the storm
[54:47] just doing that he said and then the
[54:49] storm missed them
[54:51] so but it's better to be prepared and
[54:53] not have to deal with it than have to
[54:55] deal with it
[54:56] not being prepared so and then
[54:59] he said um we'll be coming out got my
[55:02] ticket and all
[55:03] then he sent me a text late afternoon he
[55:05] said we're on an airplane circle in
[55:07] atlanta because we can't land because of
[55:09] the storm
[55:10] pray that the tucson flight doesn't get
[55:12] cancelled
[55:14] so we spread it around quickly about 15
[55:18] minutes later he said the flight has
[55:19] landed
[55:20] and the flight hasn't canceled so i'll
[55:23] be there and he said a clean flight all
[55:25] the way over here got in here

[1:08:34] out
[1:08:34] my spirit amen let's just pray heavenly
[1:08:38] father
[1:08:39] lord we feel your quickening power lord
[1:08:43] as we just
[1:08:43] read your word father for truly
[1:08:46] it's within this word that all the
[1:08:49] resource for
[1:08:50] everything that we need in life is found
[1:08:53] it's not found in a broken cistern of
[1:08:55] hollywood
[1:08:56] it's not found in the broken cisterns of
[1:08:59] political systems and
[1:09:00] socialized lord social ideas and
[1:09:04] cultures that the world has created
[1:09:06] trying to find
[1:09:07] answers lord but the resource the
[1:09:10] wellspring
[1:09:11] of all living water comes from your word
[1:09:15] lord
[1:09:16] and we just raise our hands this morning
[1:09:18] in unison in unity as one
[1:09:20] body and say lord would you come and
[1:09:22] speak
[1:09:23] lord and would your spirit pour out upon
[1:09:26] all flesh this morning
[1:09:28] may it be rich may it be full may it be
[1:09:31] exactly what we need
[1:09:32] as we surrender now to you in the name
[1:09:35] of jesus christ we pray
[1:09:37] and the church said amen you can have
[1:09:40] your seats this morning
[1:09:43] i don't know how far we'll get to i'm
[1:09:46] just going to be obedient to the lord
[1:09:48] amen and if i had been a few months
[1:09:50] since i get here then i could make up
[1:09:52] and we could have a couple overtimes
[1:09:54] right
[1:09:55] amen well we'll try to we'll try not to
[1:09:57] do that try to get
[1:09:58] just what the lord amen wants us to stay
[1:10:01] and then we'll we'll stop
[1:10:03] amen the scripture here and we're just
[1:10:05] going to just go through some of this
[1:10:08] slowly as we just just see what the lord
[1:10:10] would have us
[1:10:12] cover but joe comes 10 years and we
[1:10:15] don't want to take too much time to get
[1:10:17] into the
[1:10:18] the setting of the history but it's very
[1:10:19] important
[1:10:21] so that you understand exactly what his
[1:10:23] word would mean and what his burden was
[1:10:26] the prophet joel speaks to this southern
[1:10:28] tribe
[1:10:29] pre-exiled joel comes to the
[1:10:33] the house of judah the southern kingdom
[1:10:36] and he
[1:10:37] he's living in this time of king uzziah
[1:10:40] and when you think of king uzziah in the
[1:10:42] bible you remember
[1:10:44] the scripture of isaiah when isaiah says
[1:10:47] the year
[1:10:48] that the king uzziah died i saw the lord
[1:10:50] seated on a throne
[1:10:52] high and lifted up high and exalted in
[1:10:55] other words
[1:10:56] the human kingdom of uzziah had died and
[1:11:00] now god was going to
[1:11:01] usher in the new king the risen the the
[1:11:04] the jehovah
[1:11:05] the real king and so but this time of
[1:11:08] uzziah that joel is going to prophesy in
[1:11:12] it's a great time of great plenty
[1:11:15] the bible would call it a year of
[1:11:17] fatness and when you see that in the
[1:11:18] bible
[1:11:20] it means a year of great success great
[1:11:22] prosperity
[1:11:24] they didn't want for much and it's very
[1:11:26] amazing what you read in joel 1
[1:11:29] because you see that a plague has fallen
[1:11:31] and locusts have came
[1:11:33] and they've devoured and destroyed but
[1:11:35] prior to that
[1:11:37] curse that god sends is a time of
[1:11:41] great prosperity
[1:11:44] it's a time where there's great progress
[1:11:46] and almost on every aspect in israel
[1:11:50] monetarily financially militarily
[1:11:53] administratively
[1:11:54] commercially economically there was a
[1:11:57] time of flourishment
[1:11:59] and and it's it's even said of king
[1:12:01] uzziah
[1:12:02] in second chronicles that his fame
[1:12:05] spread as far as the border of egypt
[1:12:08] because he had became very powerful
[1:12:12] it speaks and says that second only to
[1:12:15] solomon
[1:12:16] was this great time this golden year you
[1:12:19] would call it
[1:12:20] this golden age that the children of
[1:12:23] israel are living in under king uzziah
[1:12:25] great prosperity and and he begins to
[1:12:28] contrast
[1:12:28] that in chapter one when he says the
[1:12:31] vats are broken and
[1:12:32] and and all the all the field
[1:12:34] languisheth and there's no
[1:12:36] field for the no pasture for the cattle
[1:12:39] but
[1:12:39] he's contrasting that but prior to the
[1:12:42] plague it was a
[1:12:44] time of great success time of
[1:12:47] great prosperity where their vats were
[1:12:50] overflowing but it's amazing because
[1:12:53] he's
[1:12:54] joel is not going to come to speak
[1:12:57] to the natural condition or to address
[1:13:00] the natural
[1:13:02] uh uh a burden that's not what's upon
[1:13:05] his heart
[1:13:05] because most of the time when god comes
[1:13:08] and he anoints a vessel
[1:13:09] and he begins to use that vessel to
[1:13:11] minister to his people
[1:13:13] god has a message on his heart it's not
[1:13:16] the man or the prophet that has a
[1:13:17] message upon his heart
[1:13:19] but god has baptized that prophet with
[1:13:22] his
[1:13:22] own personal burden and that man then
[1:13:26] becomes the instrument he becomes the
[1:13:29] oracle
[1:13:29] for god the mouth of god and the words
[1:13:32] of god to begin to speak
[1:13:34] the mind of god and so a prophet doesn't
[1:13:37] come with his own message he's a eunuch
[1:13:39] he has no seed of his own he has no
[1:13:42] thought of his own
[1:13:43] but he becomes a tool and an instrument
[1:13:46] to translate and to become a conduit to
[1:13:50] send
[1:13:50] the heart and the burden of god
[1:13:54] and so he begins to display joel begins
[1:13:57] to minister
[1:13:59] and he begins to speak of the burden of
[1:14:01] the lord is not upon their natural
[1:14:03] condition
[1:14:04] but it's actually their spiritual
[1:14:08] condition you see to god
[1:14:11] your spiritual condition is actually all
[1:14:15] that matters
[1:14:17] now i know your health is important and
[1:14:18] god says i desire
[1:14:20] that you be in health and that you
[1:14:21] prosper and god's concerned that you
[1:14:23] live a life with joy he didn't save you
[1:14:25] to be miserable
[1:14:26] he didn't save you to be down and do me
[1:14:28] and gloomy he saved you to be
[1:14:31] a joy unspeakable and full of glory and
[1:14:34] we should have the joy and the happiness
[1:14:36] of god
[1:14:36] but let me just come to you just here
[1:14:38] for a moment and tell you
[1:14:40] that god is more concerned mostly with
[1:14:43] your spiritual health than
[1:14:44] any other aspect of your life
[1:14:50] and if you're a child of god a seed of
[1:14:52] god whether you're
[1:14:53] today where you should be or maybe
[1:14:55] you're born by the spirit of god or
[1:14:57] or you're you're you haven't came to a
[1:15:00] new birth
[1:15:01] here this morning let me just say that
[1:15:03] god's interest
[1:15:04] in you god's purpose for you
[1:15:09] god's plans for you
[1:15:12] and your life is a spiritual plan
[1:15:15] not a natural plan amen am i i have to
[1:15:19] amend my own preaching today but that's
[1:15:21] all right
[1:15:22] god's plan for you is a spiritual plan
[1:15:26] he has a spiritual burden he has a
[1:15:29] something upon his mind he wants you to
[1:15:32] prosper and be in health and be happy
[1:15:35] but ultimately
[1:15:36] as the prophet of god said i would
[1:15:38] rather eat
[1:15:39] soda water branch water and drink soda
[1:15:42] crackers
[1:15:43] but have the spirit of god in my soul
[1:15:46] that have all the riches of the world
[1:15:50] you see to god your spiritual condition
[1:15:53] and where you're at
[1:15:55] spiritually is really all that matters
[1:15:58] to god
[1:15:59] our physical life our emotional life is
[1:16:01] important but ultimately
[1:16:03] it's our spiritual condition that god is
[1:16:06] the most
[1:16:07] concerned with in so much
[1:16:10] that if god has to break your physical
[1:16:13] condition to fix your spiritual
[1:16:17] condition then god is a kind loving
[1:16:21] heavenly father
[1:16:24] and if he has to break your health if he
[1:16:26] has to break your bank if he has to
[1:16:27] destroy your home
[1:16:29] physically then god knows what's best to
[1:16:34] get your attention and i'm so glad that
[1:16:35] he does
[1:16:37] you see he's a heavenly father
[1:16:41] he's a heavenly father and his interest
[1:16:44] is
[1:16:45] in his children as the prophet of god
[1:16:48] says and i hear the words of brother
[1:16:50] branham when he begins to talk about a
[1:16:51] mother
[1:16:52] and he says that mother's love that
[1:16:54] loves that child so much
[1:16:56] and he says but if it's a real true love
[1:16:59] he said if that mother really truly
[1:17:02] loves that
[1:17:02] soul of that baby that soul of that
[1:17:05] child
[1:17:06] he says then that mother no matter how
[1:17:08] much it might hurt the feelings of that
[1:17:10] child or might hurt her own feelings
[1:17:13] he says when that mother sees that child
[1:17:15] and it starts to
[1:17:17] it starts to go in air and it and it
[1:17:19] goes and he says that that
[1:17:21] mother starts to see that child he says
[1:17:23] uh make a mistake
[1:17:24] and it needs discipline he says then
[1:17:26] that mother no matter how much it hurts
[1:17:28] her
[1:17:29] he says she'll spank that child if she's
[1:17:31] got a real mother's love
[1:17:34] now not out of cruelty not out of some
[1:17:36] maniacal way
[1:17:37] but out of real true love
[1:17:41] as jesus says as many as i love i rebuke
[1:17:44] and
[1:17:45] chasten i chastise
[1:17:49] and the prophet of god says no matter
[1:17:50] how much it hurts her to spank that
[1:17:53] child
[1:17:53] she doesn't enjoy that it's not a moment
[1:17:56] that she enjoys her father enjoys
[1:17:58] but he said if you really truly love
[1:18:01] them
[1:18:02] even if it hurts your feelings you will
[1:18:04] correct the error
[1:18:07] of that child because why because why
[1:18:12] brother matt why do we bring correction
[1:18:14] to our child now you're you you have the
[1:18:16] human love
[1:18:18] and the natural love of a mother and
[1:18:19] father how much more does our heavenly
[1:18:22] father
[1:18:23] who has a natural not a natural love but
[1:18:26] a heavenly
[1:18:27] love not a human love but an agape
[1:18:31] love how much more if he sees one of his
[1:18:34] children going the wrong way that god
[1:18:37] will bring a rod of correction
[1:18:39] to try to correct the error of your life
[1:18:44] as brother adam says it's it's the real
[1:18:47] true love
[1:18:48] why do we bring correction to that child
[1:18:50] oh it's not a big deal
[1:18:52] you know just let it go a big deal it
[1:18:54] really doesn't matter no
[1:18:55] a real true love you say why do we why
[1:18:58] do we why do we discipline why do we
[1:19:00] spank our children why do we bring
[1:19:01] correction
[1:19:02] in their life it's because their
[1:19:05] ultimate condition
[1:19:06] what they're going to be in life is more
[1:19:09] important to
[1:19:10] a mother and a father it's more
[1:19:12] important to you
[1:19:14] what they are becoming rather than what
[1:19:17] they are
[1:19:18] right now can you say amen to the word
[1:19:21] this morning
[1:19:22] it's more important to you not what they
[1:19:25] are
[1:19:26] now i'm getting somewhere so just stick
[1:19:28] with me here
[1:19:29] it's not so important what you see right
[1:19:32] now
[1:19:32] or what's happening right now but what
[1:19:35] they're
[1:19:36] going to be oh let me just preach here
[1:19:38] for a moment
[1:19:39] my brother and my sister i'm so glad i
[1:19:41] got a heavenly father
[1:19:42] and i could say god cares more about
[1:19:45] what he's bringing me to
[1:19:47] than where i'm at right now and god puts
[1:19:50] more emphasis on the vision and the plan
[1:19:53] he has for me
[1:19:54] in the future than what he sees right
[1:19:57] now
[1:19:59] god cares more about where you're going
[1:20:02] to be
[1:20:04] than where you are currently
[1:20:08] and maybe you don't understand you could
[1:20:09] say this morning i don't understand
[1:20:11] what's happening in my life and i don't
[1:20:13] understand what's happening
[1:20:14] often times he's using what's happening
[1:20:17] now
[1:20:18] to prepare you for what's coming down
[1:20:20] the road
[1:20:21] what you can't see is around the corner
[1:20:24] god is using right now current
[1:20:27] circumstances and trials and
[1:20:29] tribulations and discipline in your life
[1:20:32] he's concerned about what's around the
[1:20:34] corner so he'll bring certain things in
[1:20:36] your life to prepare you for that
[1:20:38] moment are you with me this morning
[1:20:43] sometimes we question and say lord why
[1:20:45] is this happening and
[1:20:46] i just don't understand and why are
[1:20:48] certain things that seem out of place in
[1:20:50] my life and
[1:20:51] certain things seem mixed up and
[1:20:53] disjointed and
[1:20:54] the pieces don't all fit and they seem
[1:20:56] out of joint and things seem so messed
[1:20:58] up but just remember
[1:21:00] god never really looks at the current
[1:21:02] condition but he looks at what you're
[1:21:04] going to
[1:21:05] be and his motivation and how he works
[1:21:10] is his plan
[1:21:14] so what does that mean brother matt that
[1:21:17] means that god
[1:21:18] never gets discouraged by your failures
[1:21:21] right now
[1:21:23] god never gets discouraged by the
[1:21:25] condition of you
[1:21:26] right now because he's already seen a
[1:21:28] picture of what he's bringing you to be
[1:21:31] god never gets discouraged by your he
[1:21:34] never gets discouraged by how low you
[1:21:36] might seem
[1:21:37] so let me say this so we shouldn't get
[1:21:39] discouraged
[1:21:40] by our current conditions don't ever let
[1:21:42] your current circumstance
[1:21:44] discourage you but always say lord i
[1:21:46] believe no matter what i see right now
[1:21:49] you're bringing me to
[1:21:50] something oh let me go a step further
[1:21:53] than that don't look at your current
[1:21:54] conditions of your children
[1:21:56] and where they're at right now and maybe
[1:21:58] all you see in your marriage and in your
[1:22:00] home and
[1:22:00] in your health and all you see is you're
[1:22:02] you're flooded by the discouragement of
[1:22:04] right now but say lord i'm not gonna get
[1:22:06] bogged down upon what i see right now
[1:22:09] i'm going to believe you're bringing me
[1:22:10] to something you've got a plan for my
[1:22:13] life you've got a purpose for me god and
[1:22:15] i say this morning bring me to that
[1:22:17] purpose oh lord
[1:22:18] bring me to what you've envisioned for
[1:22:20] my life the blueprint that you've laid
[1:22:22] out
[1:22:29] i believe you're bringing me to
[1:22:31] something you've got a vision for my
[1:22:33] life
[1:22:34] so whatever my oh i just say take joy
[1:22:38] this morning no matter what it looks
[1:22:40] like in your circumstance you could say
[1:22:42] lord
[1:22:42] i believe you've got a vision and a
[1:22:44] purpose and a plan
[1:22:46] for my life so whatever my life looks
[1:22:49] like right now
[1:22:50] it's only proof that you're working on
[1:22:52] something in me
[1:22:56] joel mentions this and he says in
[1:22:57] chapter one there so what what happens
[1:23:00] prior to this plague
[1:23:01] their vine is flourishing their vats
[1:23:04] were overflowing
[1:23:05] the fig trees and the pomegranate trees
[1:23:07] and apples and all the fruits were
[1:23:09] loading down their land was fertile
[1:23:13] barns were filled to the brim olive oil
[1:23:16] was
[1:23:17] flowing like a river everything just
[1:23:20] seems so
[1:23:21] good so good
[1:23:24] it's amazing how we categorize good
[1:23:28] it's amazing how we look at life and say
[1:23:30] oh
[1:23:31] life is just good win when i have this
[1:23:34] and this and this and this and when i'm
[1:23:35] here at this place and here
[1:23:37] over here and this is happening oh life
[1:23:39] is just good and then when god comes and
[1:23:41] he messes all that up we just
[1:23:42] oh we're just oh life is so terrible oh
[1:23:45] it's just oh can we just go back to you
[1:23:47] know to pre-covet
[1:23:50] as if life was somehow good pre-covered
[1:23:53] let me tell you something friends the
[1:23:54] world was falling apart
[1:24:00] pre-coveted
[1:24:02] oh it's so good the cattle never fell
[1:24:05] the herds were multiplying the plot the
[1:24:07] flocks were
[1:24:08] plentiful everything on the outside
[1:24:12] from the outside the veneer was perfect
[1:24:15] it was in place
[1:24:17] had all the things that looked just so
[1:24:19] crisp and so clean and so
[1:24:21] manicured and fruit was flowing and the
[1:24:23] oil was flowing
[1:24:25] the cattle were feeding the herds were
[1:24:28] multiplying the flocks were plentiful
[1:24:31] and everything on the outside just
[1:24:33] looked so
[1:24:34] just perfect but god says but i see
[1:24:38] beyond the shell of
[1:24:39] outward veneer i see beyond the shell of
[1:24:42] religiosity i see beyond the shell of
[1:24:45] what your human exterior looks like and
[1:24:47] i
[1:24:47] look into the heart
[1:24:52] and god says now let's look at the
[1:24:55] spiritual
[1:24:57] condition what does notice this here
[1:25:01] let's look at the spiritual
[1:25:04] condition because what does oftentimes
[1:25:07] what does material prosperity
[1:25:10] bring i'm not just talking about money
[1:25:12] you got the nicest house or the nicest
[1:25:14] cards or the
[1:25:14] greatest things in the world your
[1:25:16] everyone defines uh the level of
[1:25:18] prosperity differently in different
[1:25:20] classes and
[1:25:21] and but but life this is uh this is all
[1:25:23] about just a good time
[1:25:24] it's a good time in life where there's
[1:25:26] no trouble no stress no worry
[1:25:28] and and but but let me just say this
[1:25:30] friends what does oftentimes material
[1:25:34] goodness bring if we would all just for
[1:25:37] a moment put down our
[1:25:39] take them off take off those angel wings
[1:25:41] just for a moment
[1:25:43] take that halo and sit it down here for
[1:25:45] a second can i just preach to you
[1:25:47] on a on a real level we could lose all
[1:25:51] of our masks
[1:25:52] here this morning's putting on our angel
[1:25:54] wings i know y'all drove this morning on
[1:25:56] a chair and a chariot
[1:25:59] i did literally they they decided to
[1:26:02] give me a mustang i guess they think
[1:26:04] every young guy wants a sports car and
[1:26:06] so i
[1:26:06] go out to get my car and it's a mustang
[1:26:08] i thought oh and i got to drive this to
[1:26:10] church on sunday morning
[1:26:13] so i parked over there on the side where
[1:26:14] no one can see me
[1:26:17] let's put down our angel wings for a
[1:26:18] minute
[1:26:20] what does natural success oftentimes
[1:26:23] bring
[1:26:24] if we'd all be honest here before god
[1:26:27] and ourself
[1:26:28] the best natural circumstance
[1:26:31] times of peace times of fatness and
[1:26:34] plenty
[1:26:35] oftentimes leads to great
[1:26:39] spiritual poverty
[1:26:43] and for some eventual spiritual
[1:26:46] death moses warned of this in
[1:26:48] deuteronomy 6 you can
[1:26:50] put that up if you want i'm going to
[1:26:51] read it deuteronomy 6 verse 10
[1:26:54] and it shall be when notice this here
[1:26:56] and it shall be
[1:26:57] when the lord your god shall have
[1:27:00] brought you
[1:27:01] let me make sure i didn't miss this here
[1:27:03] this morning no he says and it shall be
[1:27:06] when the lord your god shall have
[1:27:07] brought thee into the land which he
[1:27:09] swore unto thy fathers to abraham to
[1:27:11] isaac and to jacob
[1:27:12] to give the great and goodly cities
[1:27:15] notice this
[1:27:16] which thou buildest not
[1:27:19] important asterisk there and and houses
[1:27:23] verse 11 full of good things which
[1:27:26] thou fill us not and
[1:27:30] wells digged which thou
[1:27:33] diggest not vineyards and
[1:27:37] olive trees which thou plantest not when
[1:27:40] thou
[1:27:40] shall have eaten and be full
[1:27:44] then then very important then
[1:27:47] beware no no
[1:27:50] don't stop reading for a minute don't
[1:27:52] read ahead of me
[1:27:54] now hold on when you get over there and
[1:27:56] your land is full of plenty notice what
[1:27:58] moses begins to say here and he says it
[1:28:01] shall be when the lord has brought you
[1:28:02] up and he takes you into canaan he takes
[1:28:04] you into that land
[1:28:06] which you swore unto your fathers to
[1:28:08] give it to them
[1:28:09] and he says he'll give you great goodly
[1:28:12] cities which thou
[1:28:13] built us not you didn't labor you didn't
[1:28:15] sweat you didn't toil there was no work
[1:28:18] into it
[1:28:18] house is full of good things
[1:28:22] wells dig which thou diggest not
[1:28:25] they didn't have well drills in those
[1:28:28] days so it was laborsome to drill
[1:28:30] and to dig and to toil and to sweat
[1:28:35] and to give of yourself which thou
[1:28:37] plantest not vineyards and olive trees
[1:28:39] when thou shall have eaten and be full
[1:28:42] then
[1:28:43] then then beware he says in verse 12
[1:28:47] here's a warning lest thou forget
[1:28:52] the lord
[1:28:56] lest thou forget
[1:29:01] the lord how
[1:29:05] how brother and preaches a message
[1:29:08] remembering the lord
[1:29:10] it's amazing how the carnal nature
[1:29:14] as even moses says that you get over
[1:29:15] there and you've got everything and
[1:29:16] you'd
[1:29:17] you just thank god forever of the
[1:29:19] goodness and the greatness and all that
[1:29:21] he's done
[1:29:23] moses says but beware lest you forget
[1:29:27] the lord
[1:29:28] which brought thee forth out of the land
[1:29:30] of egypt
[1:29:31] from the house of bondage
[1:29:35] when you come into the land you're going
[1:29:36] to find houses you didn't build
[1:29:38] and they're going to be full of good
[1:29:40] things i'm going to give you plenty
[1:29:42] things that you that you didn't build
[1:29:44] you didn't do this god did it
[1:29:46] wells that you can drink from of water
[1:29:50] that you didn't dig there's no labor
[1:29:52] involved there was no stress there was
[1:29:54] no sweat
[1:29:55] when you work for something you can
[1:29:56] appreciate it
[1:29:58] you know what it means to have it
[1:30:00] because you gained it because you've
[1:30:01] done it
[1:30:02] and it'll be precious to you it'll be
[1:30:04] important to you it means something to
[1:30:06] you
[1:30:07] so this is the warning from god when god
[1:30:09] gives you
[1:30:10] something like the holy ghost
[1:30:13] which is a gift from god and it gives
[1:30:17] you something or a salvation a free gift
[1:30:20] and you don't earn it it's given to you
[1:30:22] you didn't build it you didn't earn it
[1:30:23] you didn't sweat over it
[1:30:25] but it gives you good things and listen
[1:30:27] to me my brother god
[1:30:29] fills our homes our hearts
[1:30:32] our vessels with good things oh we've
[1:30:35] got a lot of good things you've got a
[1:30:37] lot to be thankful for today
[1:30:39] as a son or daughter of god you ought to
[1:30:42] raise your hands and just say lord
[1:30:43] thank you for all the good things that
[1:30:46] you've done in my life
[1:30:47] i'm blessed beyond measure
[1:30:51] like i'm blessed beyond measure i've
[1:30:54] been blessed as the song
[1:30:56] says of a roof up above me and
[1:30:59] shoes on my feet food at my table uh
[1:31:02] children who
[1:31:03] uh in a home uh love in my family and
[1:31:07] harmony and then more and above all of
[1:31:09] the all of the natural things
[1:31:11] i want to say lord thank you that you
[1:31:13] put a desire
[1:31:15] in my heart to serve you to want you to
[1:31:18] to worship you thank you that you
[1:31:19] changed me
[1:31:24] when i couldn't change myself
[1:31:29] he gives you good things so moses says
[1:31:34] be careful beware lest thou forget the
[1:31:37] lord
[1:31:40] lest thou get there and forget the
[1:31:43] freedom
[1:31:44] that he's brought for you this is
[1:31:46] exactly what happens to israel
[1:31:47] in a great time of prosperity they
[1:31:49] forgot the lord
[1:31:53] so you know what god did you know what
[1:31:56] god does
[1:31:57] god sends a plague
[1:32:01] i had a video i don't want to show it
[1:32:02] today it just would take too much time
[1:32:04] but it's just a modern day
[1:32:06] locust outbreak and if you could see the
[1:32:09] video of the swarms
[1:32:11] of locusts and they hatch overnight and
[1:32:14] there's
[1:32:15] hundreds of thousands of of
[1:32:18] large grasshoppers and they just go and
[1:32:21] they
[1:32:21] they in in one day they travel i forget
[1:32:24] how many hundreds of miles
[1:32:26] and in their path they leave nothing
[1:32:28] they they eat all of the crops they
[1:32:30] don't just eat the fruit they eat the
[1:32:32] stalk they eat
[1:32:33] all the way to the roots in the ground
[1:32:35] when the locust is finished
[1:32:37] it's just barren and dry and dust
[1:32:40] there's nothing
[1:32:41] left and so god
[1:32:44] they forget the lord and so god sends a
[1:32:46] plague of locusts
[1:32:49] he sends them this this plague and let
[1:32:52] me just say to you is it to
[1:32:54] punish them is it is it to pick on them
[1:32:56] is god
[1:32:57] doing that is he sending they they have
[1:32:59] a time of planning and god sends this
[1:33:01] drought he sends the locust
[1:33:02] and you say is is god doing it some
[1:33:04] maniacal uh
[1:33:06] god and he's just trying to get revenge
[1:33:08] on them you know
[1:33:09] it's so important
[1:33:12] how you view what
[1:33:16] god is doing in your life
[1:33:19] it is so important on how you view your
[1:33:22] trials and your tests
[1:33:25] and your tribulations
[1:33:28] because if you look at what god is doing
[1:33:30] to some punishment or spewing out anger
[1:33:33] then you've missed the character of god
[1:33:35] and you've misunderstood
[1:33:37] why god has you in a hard time in your
[1:33:39] life
[1:33:41] let me just say this to you today the
[1:33:43] satan would love to misconstrue what's
[1:33:45] happened to you and say god doesn't love
[1:33:47] you
[1:33:47] god's just doing that he's angry and
[1:33:49] he's pouring out his anger and you've
[1:33:51] just
[1:33:51] send your day of grace away and now
[1:33:54] you're just forever going to be
[1:33:55] uh and listen to me friend satan would
[1:33:57] love to make you misunderstand
[1:34:00] that it wasn't revenge it wasn't that at
[1:34:03] all
[1:34:04] why does he send a plague of locusts is
[1:34:06] it because he's cruel no
[1:34:07] he doesn't because he's going to the
[1:34:10] most important
[1:34:12] aspect of their life and let me just say
[1:34:18] god
[1:34:19] always has a good reason
[1:34:22] i'm just going to stop and slow down for
[1:34:24] a moment god
[1:34:26] always has a good reason
[1:34:30] i don't understand the reason you can't
[1:34:32] make sense of that god always has a good
[1:34:34] reason
[1:34:35] you say how do you know that brother
[1:34:36] matt because he's a good father
[1:34:40] he's a good good father
[1:34:43] that's what he is he's a good god
[1:34:47] he's a good father and whatever he
[1:34:50] brings in your life
[1:34:52] whatever it is it's for
[1:34:55] your benefit
[1:34:58] listen to what brother branham says here
[1:35:00] and this is just i want you to hear
[1:35:02] this if they have the powerpoint there
[1:35:05] you can just display if they need to
[1:35:06] turn the lights and dim them that's
[1:35:08] perfectly fine
[1:35:09] brother jordan i think you said that i
[1:35:10] want i want them to see i've got a lot
[1:35:12] to display
[1:35:13] so turn it down as low as you want amen
[1:35:16] want to make sure you can see these
[1:35:18] seems like it's a little still a little
[1:35:20] hard to know they're having trouble
[1:35:22] out of the projector there can you see
[1:35:23] that there in the back
[1:35:25] you see that there brother adam says in
[1:35:28] leadership he says oh god
[1:35:30] let me go lord don't leave me behind
[1:35:34] jesus
[1:35:35] let me go with you father i don't want
[1:35:37] to stay here
[1:35:39] on this earth to watch these
[1:35:41] tribulations
[1:35:42] coming on i say lord i don't want to
[1:35:44] stay here
[1:35:45] on this earth how many can identify with
[1:35:47] the prophet this morning
[1:35:48] and say lord i don't want to stay here
[1:35:50] he says god let me don't leave me
[1:35:52] behind jesus i want the lord to see my
[1:35:56] hand this morning
[1:35:57] don't don't leave me behind lord jesus
[1:35:59] let me go with you father

[1:36:03] to watch these tribulations coming on
[1:36:05] i don't want to stay here in the this
[1:36:07] insanity i don't want to stand here
[1:36:10] when hideous sights the people losing
[1:36:12] their minds
[1:36:14] he says we look at man trying to act
[1:36:16] like beasts
[1:36:18] and look like beasts and the women
[1:36:21] trying to look like
[1:36:22] animals with the paints on their face
[1:36:24] knowing that these things are predicted
[1:36:26] to happen that the thing will
[1:36:29] they'll go notice they'll go insane
[1:36:34] to locust will raise up with hair like
[1:36:37] women
[1:36:38] to haunt the women and teeth like
[1:36:42] lions and things that you've said the
[1:36:46] mental can listen
[1:36:47] listen friends you you think you think
[1:36:49] covet was bad you think that was a
[1:36:51] plague
[1:36:52] go read revelations 9 you'll get a
[1:36:54] revelation of what a plague
[1:36:55] is
[1:36:59] let me just say that was nothing
[1:37:02] just a little kick up and that one
[1:37:04] little hiccup
[1:37:06] has wrecked havoc wreaked havoc
[1:37:09] on the entire world
[1:37:15] and it was nothing when brother adam
[1:37:18] says with hair like women to haunt the
[1:37:20] women and teeth like lions and things
[1:37:21] that you've said the mental condition of
[1:37:23] the people will
[1:37:24] be completely gone if you think the
[1:37:28] world
[1:37:28] is insane today
[1:37:32] wait till the bride is out of here
[1:37:36] and the bible says he that whom that
[1:37:38] letteth will let
[1:37:39] until he be taken out of the way you
[1:37:42] know who that he
[1:37:43] that that he that be taken out of the
[1:37:45] way that's you
[1:37:46] that's the remnant that's the elected
[1:37:49] and when when they're taken out of the
[1:37:50] way
[1:37:51] judgment that spewing anger of god pours
[1:37:53] like a cauldron over the entire world
[1:37:56] i say lord don't let me be here don't
[1:37:58] leave me behind lord take me with you
[1:38:00] lord and he says of the people will be
[1:38:04] completely gone we see it in the making
[1:38:05] right now lord help us
[1:38:07] restore to us the same mind
[1:38:11] oh i just will give you the opportunity
[1:38:13] to raise your hand
[1:38:14] and say like a prayer restore to us the
[1:38:17] same mind of christ jesus
[1:38:22] our lord
[1:38:25] i say like brother branham don't leave
[1:38:27] me here
[1:38:29] let me go with you father don't let me
[1:38:31] be here to experience
[1:38:33] that you know what that's for my brother
[1:38:36] my sister why is the tribulation for
[1:38:38] brother branham says it's a purging
[1:38:40] because they've rejected christ the word
[1:38:42] he says it's a purging it purges all of
[1:38:45] the world it purges
[1:38:46] everything out and you know what brother
[1:38:48] adam says the holy ghost is given for
[1:38:50] to purge you so you know what i say this
[1:38:53] morning i say don't let me experience
[1:38:55] that purge
[1:38:57] so purge me now lord let me go through
[1:39:00] the purge right now if there be anything
[1:39:02] unlike you i'll let the holy spirit
[1:39:05] purge me of
[1:39:06] anything that's unlike your word this
[1:39:08] morning lord
[1:39:10] notice here he says he warns them
[1:39:14] and he says this in joe 2 and he says
[1:39:17] you're
[1:39:18] no no notice what's happening i'll just
[1:39:19] mute that just for a moment
[1:39:21] actually brother jeremy if you could
[1:39:22] bring up joel 2 and just pause that for
[1:39:24] a minute
[1:39:25] notice what he says here this is a time
[1:39:29] of great plenty and
[1:39:30] a progress and prosperity but there's
[1:39:32] spiritual conditions so god sends a
[1:39:34] plague
[1:39:35] and he wipes everything out
[1:39:38] and now the vats are empty and broken in
[1:39:40] the fields as we read in joel 1 there's
[1:39:42] nothing left
[1:39:44] and it just looks like total barrenness
[1:39:47] and then god begins to say but i i want
[1:39:50] to bring a promise
[1:39:52] you see what's waiting i hope you catch
[1:39:56] this today
[1:39:57] what's waiting on the other side of the
[1:39:59] plague
[1:40:00] what's waiting on the other side of the
[1:40:02] barrenness what's waiting just on the or
[1:40:04] on the other side
[1:40:05] it's a god who has a heart to restore
[1:40:09] a god who has a heart to give back a
[1:40:12] heart to a god that says
[1:40:13] i want to wash you i want to clean you i
[1:40:15] want to give you something i want to
[1:40:17] fill you
[1:40:21] that's what i want but in order to get
[1:40:24] there you got to first
[1:40:25] repent you got to first turn away notice
[1:40:28] what he says here in joe 2 verse 12
[1:40:31] brother jeremy if you have that
[1:40:32] therefore also now saith the lord turn
[1:40:36] you even to me
[1:40:39] with all your heart
[1:40:42] oh i just asked myself this morning read
[1:40:45] that just read that felt the anointing
[1:40:47] of god
[1:40:48] drop upon my soul and i said lord
[1:40:51] i want i want to turn my whole heart if
[1:40:53] i have it lord i want to make sure that
[1:40:55] all of
[1:40:56] me that 100 of me has turned to you lord
[1:41:01] turn with your whole heart have we done
[1:41:05] that
[1:41:06] have you done that have you turned with
[1:41:09] all that's within you and with fasting
[1:41:13] and with weeping and with mourning
[1:41:15] oh you think fasting no that doesn't
[1:41:17] matter the morning doesn't
[1:41:19] it's just whatever you pray and what you
[1:41:20] confess with your mouth and believe with
[1:41:22] your heart
[1:41:23] listen to me friends it's important to
[1:41:25] god
[1:41:28] with fasting and with weapon and with
[1:41:30] mourning and rend verse 13
[1:41:33] and rend versus the next verse there
[1:41:36] brother jeremy and rind
[1:41:38] that means to rip that means to tear
[1:41:43] your heart not your garments
[1:41:48] not your garment notice what he says rip
[1:41:51] your heart
[1:41:52] don't tell your garment that's what they
[1:41:55] would do in the old testament the
[1:41:56] prophets would take their garment and
[1:41:58] they would just
[1:41:58] rip it open they'd take sackcloth and
[1:42:01] ashes they'd wear they'd wear sackcloth
[1:42:03] that was like a
[1:42:04] almost like burlap that was itchy
[1:42:07] goat's hair and and all kinds of things
[1:42:10] that would
[1:42:10] itch them and they would take this goats
[1:42:13] they would take
[1:42:14] this sackcloth and they would pour it
[1:42:16] over or to wear it then they'd take the
[1:42:18] ashes and they'd dump it all
[1:42:19] on their head and they'd go if i forgot
[1:42:22] how many days
[1:42:24] they'd walk through israel bearing the
[1:42:26] repentance and the burden
[1:42:28] asking god forgive us lord we're a
[1:42:30] wicked and stubborn
[1:42:32] people the people as wicked and stubborn
[1:42:34] so that prophet
[1:42:35] trying to intercede on behalf of those
[1:42:38] people
[1:42:39] he would wear that sackcloth and ashes
[1:42:41] and say god
[1:42:42] hold your wrath lord don't forget these
[1:42:44] are your people i know what you see
[1:42:46] right now
[1:42:46] lord i know what it looks like right now
[1:42:48] but don't forget this is your people
[1:42:50] this is your purchase lord
[1:42:52] and they would wear that sackcloth in
[1:42:54] that ashes but notice what he says here
[1:42:56] to the people
[1:42:57] turn to me with your whole heart rend
[1:42:59] rip tear
[1:43:02] your heart not your garment
[1:43:06] god's saying don't just come to me with
[1:43:08] an outward emotion
[1:43:10] and outward tears those are fine and
[1:43:11] those are good but make sure with those
[1:43:14] tears
[1:43:14] you're rending your heart
[1:43:18] oh let me just say this morning tucson
[1:43:20] tabernacle what we need is
[1:43:22] less external conformity and more
[1:43:25] internal change and transformation to
[1:43:28] say god change me
[1:43:30] i'll do a work that i can't do i don't
[1:43:32] want to conform to some dress code or
[1:43:34] some rule book but i want you to change
[1:43:38] my heart lord
[1:43:41] change the desire change my nature
[1:43:46] oh that's a real that's a real
[1:43:47] experience of the holy ghost
[1:43:50] when god just doesn't give you some law
[1:43:52] book that you live by
[1:43:53] but let me just tell you young people
[1:43:55] god can transform you
[1:43:56] down on the inside where you don't
[1:43:58] desire the things of the world anymore
[1:44:00] you don't thirst for those things
[1:44:02] anymore you thirst for a newness and a
[1:44:04] new life and a righteousness that's not
[1:44:06] yours
[1:44:09] god changes you from the inside he says
[1:44:12] rend your heart
[1:44:16] we're in your heart say lord i'm tired
[1:44:18] of going in the same direction
[1:44:20] i'm tired i want to turn to you with my
[1:44:23] whole
[1:44:24] heart for he i love this
[1:44:28] for he hears god he's not a wicked evil
[1:44:30] god waiting up there ready to
[1:44:32] knock you down but notice what he says
[1:44:34] for he
[1:44:35] is gracious and merciful
[1:44:39] he is gracious and merciful oh i'd throw
[1:44:42] down that idea that
[1:44:44] that that uh whatever religious idea you
[1:44:46] had of god and that identity of how you
[1:44:48] imagine him
[1:44:49] let the word reveal to him who he is let
[1:44:52] it let it reveal to you
[1:44:53] and tell you no matter what you've
[1:44:54] thought about god he's merciful
[1:44:56] he's gracious he's long-suffering he
[1:44:59] desires you
[1:45:00] he's here for you he wants you he's for
[1:45:02] you
[1:45:05] he's not there to hurt you he's not
[1:45:06] there to harm you he's there to save you
[1:45:11] john 3 16 but look at verse 17 for he
[1:45:14] he didn't come to condemn the world but
[1:45:16] that through
[1:45:17] him the world might be saved
[1:45:22] turn to the lord your god for he is
[1:45:24] gracious and merciful slow to anger
[1:45:27] and of great kindness and repenteth
[1:45:30] him of the evil
[1:45:33] who knoweth look at verse 14 who knoweth
[1:45:36] if he will return and repent and leave a
[1:45:37] blessing behind him even a meat offering
[1:45:39] in the drink offered into the lord your
[1:45:40] god blow the trumpet
[1:45:42] and zion sanctify a fast call of solemn
[1:45:44] assembly gather
[1:45:46] notice this gather the people
[1:45:50] you think gathering in the congregation
[1:45:52] isn't important we get all this stream
[1:45:55] let us all be virtual
[1:45:58] i hope this is okay to preach
[1:46:02] oh i'll just stream i'll just be virtual
[1:46:05] let me tell you something friends
[1:46:06] that the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:46:08] won't be live streamed
[1:46:10] you're gonna have to be there you won't
[1:46:12] watch it on a video you won't be
[1:46:14] virtually connected
[1:46:16] you got to be there in person
[1:46:21] amen
[1:46:24] gather the people you think it's all you
[1:46:27] think
[1:46:27] god doesn't think gatherings important
[1:46:29] no what does hebrews 10 say
[1:46:31] don't forsake the assembling the
[1:46:33] gathering
[1:46:34] uh don't forsake the assembling of
[1:46:36] yourselves together
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:39] that much more as you see the day
[1:46:41] approaching
[1:46:45] copenhagen separated and disconnected a
[1:46:46] lot of people let me just say this don't
[1:46:48] be
[1:46:48] any more disconnected than you need to
[1:46:50] be
[1:46:52] because satan wants to come and put a
[1:46:54] wedge but god says gather
[1:46:56] gather it's important assemble the
[1:46:59] elders gather the children and those
[1:47:01] that suck the breasts let the bridegroom
[1:47:02] go forth thermos
[1:47:03] of his chamber and the bride out of her
[1:47:05] clothes and let the priests and the
[1:47:06] ministers of the lord weep before the
[1:47:07] porch and the altar
[1:47:09] let them say spare thy people o lord and
[1:47:11] give
[1:47:12] not that heritage to reproach that the
[1:47:15] heathen should rule over them wherefore
[1:47:16] should they say among the people where
[1:47:18] is their god
[1:47:18] what's god trying to do he's trying to
[1:47:21] sow his
[1:47:22] word it's what he's trying to do today
[1:47:24] that's what he that's why he called me
[1:47:26] that's why he put this burden upon my
[1:47:28] heart you know i don't get to choose
[1:47:29] what i preach
[1:47:30] i wish so bad i could come back there
[1:47:33] and say lord i
[1:47:33] this is what i'd like to say oh i just
[1:47:35] like to come up there with a big old
[1:47:37] smile
[1:47:38] lord and just tell them how good they
[1:47:40] are and i just love to come and bring
[1:47:42] joy and them just to eat from the bounty
[1:47:44] and the blessings of god
[1:47:46] everyone could just cry and weep and i
[1:47:48] was so bad i could choose that
[1:47:51] but you know what i don't get to choose
[1:47:52] what i preach
[1:47:54] because i'm a servant and i'm duty-bound
[1:48:00] i'm duty-bound to just become a conduit
[1:48:03] and let the lord
[1:48:04] jesus speak to your heart is he speaking
[1:48:07] to your heart this morning
[1:48:11] he's trying to sow his word
[1:48:14] into their heart you know what the
[1:48:17] reaction
[1:48:20] this is so powerful so not not powerful
[1:48:23] in the sense of
[1:48:23] of great but just amazing to me you know
[1:48:26] what the reaction
[1:48:29] the reply to this sermon was
[1:48:34] you preach this the day of the lord is
[1:48:38] coming
[1:48:39] so repent repent
[1:48:42] rend your heart don't tear your garment
[1:48:46] rinse your heart
[1:48:47] turn to the lord you know what the
[1:48:49] reaction to joel's
[1:48:51] call to repentance was for most of them
[1:48:55] instead of repenting
[1:48:58] they got drunk
[1:49:03] they got drunk they went into a stupor
[1:49:08] that's that was literally go read it go
[1:49:10] read the reaction
[1:49:12] the reaction of god's people after job's
[1:49:14] sermon
[1:49:15] was not a heart for most wasn't a heart
[1:49:17] of contrition and repentance
[1:49:21] it was more intoxication
[1:49:24] more drunkenness
[1:49:27] let me just say here this morning people
[1:49:31] every person has two different reactions
[1:49:36] to coming judgment and disaster
[1:49:40] some prepare and repent
[1:49:44] some just get drunk
[1:49:49] and they drink more they become more
[1:49:53] intoxicated
[1:49:55] and more intoxicated listen to what
[1:49:57] brother branham says here in the sudden
[1:49:59] secret
[1:50:00] going away of the church you with me i
[1:50:02] still got you
[1:50:05] he says let's just look at them if you
[1:50:07] have that brother jeremy you can put
[1:50:08] that back
[1:50:08] up he says this here and own
[1:50:12] the night let me just advance it on the
[1:50:14] night
[1:50:15] he's speaking of pearl harbor and he
[1:50:18] says just before the great attack the
[1:50:20] next morning there was a great dance or
[1:50:21] a great big party
[1:50:23] given in pearl harbor itself and no
[1:50:25] matter how much they tried to say that
[1:50:27] the japs were coming they still would
[1:50:29] not take the warning
[1:50:31] let's just look on them for a few
[1:50:32] minutes there's a little radio bulletin
[1:50:34] goes out a little piece in the corner of
[1:50:36] the paper
[1:50:37] about like a healing campaign would be
[1:50:39] advertised
[1:50:40] just a small place that the japs were on
[1:50:42] their road in the waters
[1:50:44] of the sea a great fleet notice this
[1:50:47] here
[1:50:48] a great fleet chapter on the road a
[1:50:51] great fleet
[1:50:52] was headed that way nonsense
[1:50:56] says the others we don't believe in no
[1:50:58] such a stuff as that
[1:51:00] what are you trying to scare us about
[1:51:03] then we find getting close to the night
[1:51:06] i can see at the home place
[1:51:08] instead of them preparing to get out of
[1:51:11] the city
[1:51:13] why the young girls were all putting on
[1:51:15] their new frocks
[1:51:16] and so forth they were just going down
[1:51:19] to this
[1:51:20] great big jubilee they were going to
[1:51:22] have imagine this is pearl harbor
[1:51:24] it's right before the bombs the japanese
[1:51:27] are going to come and they've
[1:51:28] sounded the warning they're on the radar
[1:51:30] they're coming
[1:51:31] and he says and also the officers of the
[1:51:34] army were just busy riding little passes
[1:51:37] so that the soldiers could all attend
[1:51:39] this party big drunken party
[1:51:42] and all the trucks were roaring and
[1:51:44] humming bringing their best of beer
[1:51:46] and their wine and stuff for this party
[1:51:50] and all the time the japanese fleet on
[1:51:53] its road there
[1:51:54] and they fell to hear
[1:51:57] the warning and as the sun began to set
[1:52:02] and they all
[1:52:03] gathered in this great tavern of a place
[1:52:06] maybe on the side somewhere the
[1:52:07] bartender polishing the bar or something
[1:52:10] said something like this say did you
[1:52:13] hear the rumor
[1:52:15] no i don't believe i did said the man he
[1:52:18] spoke to
[1:52:20] oh they say something about a japanese
[1:52:22] fleet be coming this way
[1:52:24] and then someone else drops in on the
[1:52:26] conversation a young silly girl
[1:52:29] bounces up there sticks her foot up on
[1:52:31] the bar said you
[1:52:32] gloomy-headed warts don't you know
[1:52:35] that we're here for to have a good time

[1:55:14] street and so forth just having a big
[1:55:16] time

[1:55:25] one
[1:55:26] just give me another one it's giving you
[1:55:28] that's what people do in the world

[1:55:36] i'm sure to wash all my sorrows away i'm
[1:55:38] sure everything will be okay
[1:55:40] just let me get a little bit more drunk
[1:55:41] let me and and rap and engross myself
[1:55:44] more in my business
[1:55:45] more in my natural life more in what's
[1:55:47] happening right now
[1:55:48] just push it all out don't listen to
[1:55:50] those sounds don't listen to the warning
[1:55:54] see they'll either act one or two ways
[1:55:56] you'll get more drunk
[1:55:58] or you'll ring your heart
[1:56:02] he says all the while
[1:56:06] all the time the japanese was gaining
[1:56:09] grounds coming
[1:56:10] right on the next morning when the men
[1:56:13] on the post of duty and
[1:56:15] he says and then the next morning when
[1:56:17] the men on the post of duty and the
[1:56:19] airplane signal watching and so forth
[1:56:21] had been out all night
[1:56:22] drunk running around with these women
[1:56:24] and so forth was so drowsy
[1:56:26] and upset the next morning from the big
[1:56:28] party until they were
[1:56:30] caught asleep on the job
[1:56:33] and i'm afraid that it's going to be
[1:56:36] likewise at the coming of the lord
[1:56:38] the church the church do you hear the
[1:56:41] warning
[1:56:42] not the world not the drug addict that
[1:56:45] god listen to me friends but jesus said
[1:56:48] i would rather you be the drug addict
[1:56:50] i'd rather you be the drunkard on the
[1:56:51] bar stool do you realize that's what
[1:56:54] jesus
[1:56:54] warned this age of and said i'd rather
[1:56:57] you be
[1:56:58] cold
[1:57:01] because that sinner knows he needs a god
[1:57:03] and god can contact him
[1:57:05] for repentance i'd rather you be that or
[1:57:07] on fire than to be in church
[1:57:09] and get just enough of the message of
[1:57:11] the prophet of god sent a prophet of
[1:57:14] there's a message of the hour he'd
[1:57:15] rather just give you just a little
[1:57:16] listen to me friends
[1:57:18] satan is much more interested
[1:57:21] in corrupting the truth then removing
[1:57:24] the truth
[1:57:26] he's much more interested in giving you
[1:57:28] just a little dose of religion
[1:57:31] and belief and truth to make you
[1:57:35] cold and indifferent and carnal and you
[1:57:38] devalue what god's done
[1:57:41] he'd rather you be there than drunken on
[1:57:44] a bar stool somewhere
[1:57:46] do you realize satan loves religion
[1:57:49] he loves it brother adam says he hides
[1:57:52] behind it
[1:57:55] he says i'm so afraid that it's going to
[1:57:57] be likewise of the coming of the lord
[1:57:58] the church is so took up and drunken
[1:58:00] with the cares of the world till they're
[1:58:01] going to be asleep
[1:58:03] at the coming at the post of duty at the
[1:58:06] coming
[1:58:07] of the lord
[1:58:11] he says i'm so afraid so drunken
[1:58:15] with the cares of the world
[1:58:20] he preaches notice this repent
[1:58:24] repent turn with your whole heart
[1:58:28] rend your heart don't don't get more
[1:58:31] drunk
[1:58:32] don't just keep on listen to me friend i
[1:58:34] don't care what happens
[1:58:36] i don't care what happens tomorrow or
[1:58:38] the uncertainty of today
[1:58:40] don't look at those external things
[1:58:43] satan would love to get you so
[1:58:44] distracted with the things that are
[1:58:46] happening around you that you
[1:58:48] miss what god's trying to do right now
[1:58:51] because there's there's something
[1:58:53] happening there's something in the air
[1:58:54] there's something moving
[1:58:56] and it doesn't depend upon a preacher it
[1:58:58] doesn't depend upon a personality
[1:59:00] that's it's not going to take a preacher
[1:59:02] or personality to get you in a rapture
[1:59:04] it's going to take a dine out to
[1:59:06] yourself it's going to take a heart cry
[1:59:08] to where you meet god 101 in your spirit
[1:59:11] and say lord
[1:59:12] i don't like the person i am today i
[1:59:14] look in the mirror of your word and say
[1:59:16] i want to i i'm not who i want to be but
[1:59:19] here's what i want to do i want to
[1:59:20] repent of it i want to throw it aside
[1:59:23] and i want i want to cast it down and i
[1:59:25] want to be like you
[1:59:26] jesus he preaches for repentance
[1:59:31] and notice here just as we close i know
[1:59:33] we're 11 45.
[1:59:34] can i have just a couple more let me get
[1:59:37] a good hearty amen
[1:59:38] can i have just a couple more here
[1:59:41] notice
[1:59:42] prophet joel he comes with this promise
[1:59:47] and he says but god says for i will
[1:59:50] restore
[1:59:53] notice joel chapter 2 you could put that
[1:59:55] up if you could verse
[1:59:57] he says i will restore to you the years
[2:00:00] this is something only a prophet can see
[2:00:04] because a prophet has the ability to tr
[2:00:08] to move
[2:00:08] out of the current dimension and what it
[2:00:10] currently looks like
[2:00:12] and he could see around the corner of
[2:00:13] what god's trying to bring you to
[2:00:16] and he says for i will restore saith the
[2:00:19] lord
[2:00:21] all the all the locusts i will restore
[2:00:24] you the years
[2:00:26] preaching on restoring years that the
[2:00:27] locusts hath eaten the cankerworm the
[2:00:29] caterpillar the palmer worm
[2:00:31] my great army which i sent among you
[2:00:33] notice david
[2:00:34] picks up on the same inspiration he says
[2:00:36] in psalms chapter one
[2:00:38] you can pull that up for me psalms
[2:00:40] chapter 1
[2:00:42] and david begins to say this here in
[2:00:44] verse 1
[2:00:45] of psalms 1. i'll give just a moment he
[2:00:47] says blessed is the man
[2:00:49] that walketh not of the council of the
[2:00:52] ungodly
[2:00:53] nor standeth in the way of sinners nor
[2:00:55] sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[2:00:56] notice verse 2 here
[2:00:58] he says but his delight is in the law of
[2:01:00] the lord
[2:01:02] and in his law doth he meditate day
[2:01:06] and night verse 3
[2:01:09] and he shall be like a tree
[2:01:13] planted by the rivers of water
[2:01:17] that bringeth forth fruit
[2:01:21] in his season his leath his leaf
[2:01:24] also shall not wither and whatsoever he
[2:01:28] doeth shall prosper
[2:01:31] notice this is a promise not not to the
[2:01:34] wicked
[2:01:35] but this is to those who separated
[2:01:37] themselves unto the lord
[2:01:38] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[2:01:41] rivers of water this is in the middle
[2:01:43] this is in the middle the right in the
[2:01:45] middle of the height
[2:01:47] and the zenith the crescendo the
[2:01:50] pinnacle
[2:01:51] of satan's eden when the rest of the
[2:01:54] world is going crazy and going insane
[2:01:57] and the rest of the world's getting more
[2:01:59] drunk and in a stupor
[2:02:01] but he who's he the righteous in the
[2:02:04] middle of all of that shall be like a
[2:02:06] tree
[2:02:06] planted by the rivers of water that
[2:02:08] brings forth
[2:02:10] fruit oh i want to say lord what do you
[2:02:12] have promised for my life
[2:02:14] i'm like a tree planted by the rivers of
[2:02:17] water i just say yes lord
[2:02:19] amen lord be it unto me according to
[2:02:22] your word lord
[2:02:24] whose fruit who bringeth forth fruit
[2:02:26] whose leafs
[2:02:27] do not wither
[2:02:30] david says but the ungodly are not so
[2:02:34] they become weak
[2:02:38] they become withered they're like the
[2:02:40] chaff
[2:02:41] with the wind they ungodly are not so
[2:02:44] they're tossed blown about by every wind
[2:02:47] of doctrine
[2:02:48] this is what a compromiser of the word
[2:02:51] looks like it's a withered tree diseased
[2:02:56] the outside veneer looks good looks fine
[2:02:59] on the outside
[2:03:00] but inwardly it's corrupted with every
[2:03:02] conceivable worm
[2:03:04] cankerworm and caterpillar oh i'm afraid
[2:03:07] this is the
[2:03:07] picture of much of professed believers
[2:03:10] today
[2:03:11] they neglect their bible they neglect
[2:03:13] their prayer life they neglect their
[2:03:15] reading of the word
[2:03:16] they regret neglect the assembling of
[2:03:18] themselves they neglect neglect the
[2:03:20] worshipping of the lord
[2:03:23] they become too preoccupied with life
[2:03:25] and they become
[2:03:27] lazy spiritually
[2:03:33] joel says this in verse 12.
[2:03:37] he says all the trees of the field are
[2:03:38] withered for their joy
[2:03:41] has dried up oh and joe's heart is
[2:03:44] heartbroken
[2:03:45] as he sees this condition of god's
[2:03:48] chosen people
[2:03:49] notice god still calls it his vine they
[2:03:52] hath
[2:03:53] they have laid my vine waste he still
[2:03:56] calls it even in that condition
[2:03:58] what does that vine speak of speaks of
[2:04:00] israel oh the whole nation
[2:04:03] calls him that over and over and over
[2:04:05] like a vine
[2:04:06] out of it out of egypt have i called you
[2:04:10] they have laid my vine waste
[2:04:14] he's heartbroken over this condition
[2:04:17] spiritual condition
[2:04:18] of israel he says it he hath he hath the
[2:04:21] teeth of a great lion he's laid in my
[2:04:22] vine waste and barked my fig tree
[2:04:25] chewed off the bark the branches there
[2:04:27] ever white
[2:04:28] think of it friends a forest
[2:04:32] debarked clean bare
[2:04:35] bleached white
[2:04:39] with disease what vivid language joel

[2:06:04] notes
[2:06:05] and i just stopped for a minute it's
[2:06:08] incredible i had my headphones on
[2:06:10] listening to the prophet and it's almost
[2:06:12] like you just go into a world of your
[2:06:14] own like a sphere of your
[2:06:16] own and i'm i'm there
[2:06:19] on the plane and the joy of the lord is
[2:06:22] just flowing and i'm weeping and
[2:06:24] i'm just there thank god there's nobody
[2:06:26] beside me in my entire rows empty
[2:06:28] and i'm just having a little revival
[2:06:30] meeting there and just an expectation
[2:06:32] and the lord's dealing
[2:06:33] almost as fear i could feel the presence
[2:06:35] of god and i opened my eyes
[2:06:38] and here's the screens of filth and vile
[2:06:41] and
[2:06:42] nudity and and and and basic
[2:06:45] basically on the television today

[2:06:49] filthy and vulgar
[2:06:50] and vile now listen to me friends you
[2:06:54] that has no place in the appetite to a
[2:06:58] son or daughter of god

[2:07:02] drunken stupor just give me more
[2:07:05] more shows and more netflix and more

[2:07:10] and outwardly i'll keep my christian
[2:07:12] manicure and my christian appearance and
[2:07:14] my outward appearance but inwardly
[2:07:18] inwardly corruption and spiritual death
[2:07:22] i just i couldn't believe it i opened my
[2:07:24] eyes and hear people
[2:07:25] i think you've lost all fear of god
[2:07:28] you're on a plane
[2:07:29] that is in the hands of a man
[2:07:33] it could crash at any moment we could go
[2:07:35] plunging to the
[2:07:36] to to the earth and here you are
[2:07:40] in a drunken stupor watching some of the
[2:07:42] most filthy
[2:07:43] vile things you say brother matt what
[2:07:46] was your
[2:07:47] attitude oh god like brother adam says
[2:07:49] he got the attitude oh just
[2:07:51] wipe them out lord and he said but then
[2:07:53] god showed me a great blood banner
[2:07:56] around the entire earth entire universe
[2:07:59] and he said i seen the sins come up from
[2:08:01] the earth and they would just slap the
[2:08:03] lord jesus in the face
[2:08:06] and brother branham says the voice of
[2:08:07] the lord said those are your sins
[2:08:12] you know what that does to me it makes
[2:08:14] me look inwardly and say lord
[2:08:17] i could be out of this sphere i could be
[2:08:20] just like one of them
[2:08:22] but somehow grace has called my name
[2:08:27] somehow you've called me out of the
[2:08:29] darkness oh my brother my sister you
[2:08:32] you ought to rejoice you ought to say
[2:08:34] lord thank you for your blood
[2:08:36] thank you for grace that's called me
[2:08:40] it's made me different
[2:08:53] canker worms and caterpillars
[2:08:57] destruction eating away
[2:09:02] driving people from the presence of god
[2:09:05] attacking making it unhealthy
[2:09:09] spiritually frail and spiritually weak
[2:09:13] it's no wonder we don't have depression
[2:09:14] and anxiety and
[2:09:16] mental conditions like we do today
[2:09:20] what was it they've gotten away brother
[2:09:22] adam said what was it i've gotten away
[2:09:24] from
[2:09:24] the original faith the original truth
[2:09:29] brother branham begins to speak of this
[2:09:32] i just
[2:09:34] hear in the heard this last i'm going to
[2:09:36] read it to you today you can put that on
[2:09:38] the screen
[2:09:39] brother jeremy there in the back
[2:09:43] he says not long ago i was thinking i
[2:09:46] was way up in canada i was riding one
[2:09:48] night
[2:09:49] and way back about 40 50 miles
[2:09:52] a thousand miles from a hard top road
[2:09:55] last fall
[2:09:56] was back there hunting i was riding out
[2:09:59] through the moonlight
[2:10:00] and i come to where there was a big old
[2:10:01] burnover
[2:10:03] now those of you who live in tucson and
[2:10:06] you don't have
[2:10:06] burnovers we back east we have big
[2:10:09] forests of trees and
[2:10:10] and to keep you know you do that here i
[2:10:13] guess too maybe
[2:10:14] to where you try to keep the brush under
[2:10:17] control up there in the mountains and
[2:10:18] and and and i'm sure they have
[2:10:21] controlled burns
[2:10:22] where they're burning things to prevent
[2:10:24] a big forest fire he says that was a big
[2:10:26] burnover
[2:10:28] thousand miles from a hardtop was riding
[2:10:29] out through the moonlight
[2:10:31] i have it here come to where was a big
[2:10:33] old burnover
[2:10:34] there was a great big bunch of great big
[2:10:37] tall stately pines
[2:10:40] and the moon was shining on them looked
[2:10:43] like a graveyard
[2:10:45] a spooky looking place remember he's
[2:10:48] there at night
[2:10:49] he's there at night time and he come
[2:10:51] comes out of the forest and he comes
[2:10:53] with this great big
[2:10:54] burnover and big stately pines and he
[2:10:56] says oh it was just a spooky looking
[2:10:58] place
[2:10:59] he says and there come a wind coming
[2:11:02] down and
[2:11:03] the wind began to hit them and they'd go
[2:11:08] mood
[2:11:10] just almost like an eerie sound i've
[2:11:13] heard that before
[2:11:15] i almost raised the hairs on back your
[2:11:17] neck up
[2:11:18] they'd go mood just a
[2:11:21] mournful sound i stood and i looked at
[2:11:24] it a little bit and i thought of the
[2:11:26] scripture right here
[2:11:27] yes sir you know what brother man is
[2:11:29] referring to this scripture in joel
[2:11:32] he's preaching bomber worm locust cancer
[2:11:34] and caterpillar he says it reminded me
[2:11:35] of this scripture right here
[2:11:37] those trees puts me in a mind of some of
[2:11:40] these great
[2:11:41] big fine spired churches
[2:11:44] standing up here but just as
[2:11:47] dead as a door now even the palmer worms
[2:11:51] ate all of the bark off of them and
[2:11:54] everything else
[2:11:55] the fiery trials has blazed all the
[2:11:57] spirit away from it
[2:11:59] and there's nothing left but a big
[2:12:02] stature
[2:12:03] as dead as can be
[2:12:07] and he says uh as dead as can be
[2:12:10] and when the rushing mighty wind comes
[2:12:12] from heaven the only thing they can do
[2:12:14] is groan and carry on and say it ain't
[2:12:16] so that's right
[2:12:17] hardly know anything that's right they
[2:12:19] just they say days of miracles is past
[2:12:22] just every time god sends a revival and
[2:12:23] signs and wonders begin to come up
[2:12:25] fall around the people and things like
[2:12:26] that they say oh the days of miracles
[2:12:29] has passed
[2:12:30] what the palmer worm left the
[2:12:32] caterpillar eaten what the methodist
[2:12:34] left
[2:12:35] the baptist eaten what the baptist left
[2:12:37] the presbyterian eaten
[2:12:38] what the presbyterian left the pentecost
[2:12:41] eaten till it's got to a place
[2:12:43] god why you stripped the tree of
[2:12:46] everything it's got
[2:12:48] all the power all the joy all the good
[2:12:52] things that god
[2:12:52] give to his church on the day of
[2:12:54] pentecost they've tore it out
[2:12:57] nothing left but a big
[2:13:00] church name hallelujah
[2:13:05] that's what brother branham says
[2:13:08] hallelujah
[2:13:09] just a big church name what's the matter
[2:13:12] watch the same thing you've took the
[2:13:15] route of the dead
[2:13:16] tree watched the palmer worm left the
[2:13:18] caterpillar eaten the baptist took the
[2:13:20] shouting away
[2:13:21] from the methodists and one eat this and
[2:13:25] one
[2:13:25] eat that till they stripped the church
[2:13:28] down
[2:13:29] until they got them setting just as dead
[2:13:32] as a doornail all just be honest with
[2:13:34] you friends satan's done the same thing
[2:13:36] to some of our message churches
[2:13:38] taking the joy out taking the revival
[2:13:40] out taking the shouting
[2:13:42] the dancing out till all we've got is a
[2:13:44] big old church name
[2:13:45] and when the wind of the fire of god
[2:13:47] comes down it's just a
[2:13:49] hallelujah
[2:13:52] he says the palmer and the caterpillar
[2:13:54] the baptist took the shouting the method
[2:13:56] is one ate this one ate that until they
[2:13:58] stripped the church down they got them
[2:14:00] sitting just as dead as a door now
[2:14:02] no spirit no shouting no joy
[2:14:05] no peace no healing no nothing how oh my
[2:14:08] what the method is left the baptist
[2:14:10] eaten what the baptist left the

[2:14:15] and this one took away
[2:14:16] and this one took away you haven't
[2:14:18] gotten nothing but just a church creed

[2:14:24] read this i say
[2:14:25] don't let it be me god i don't have any
[2:14:28] interest
[2:14:28] in a dead formal cold religion
[2:14:31] of a god of yesterday or what he did
[2:14:34] yesterday and just coming and fulfilling
[2:14:36] some religious duty i don't believe i
[2:14:38] believe you today could say i have no
[2:14:40] interest in that lord
[2:14:41] i want the spirit of god i want the
[2:14:43] moving of god i want the joy and the
[2:14:45] shouting and the river of life to flow
[2:14:48] through my body
[2:14:52] he says and this one eats and this one
[2:14:54] took away and took that away you haven't
[2:14:55] got nothing but a church creed
[2:14:57] you know that's the truth that's the
[2:14:59] truth what one left the other eight
[2:15:01] listen to this until you ain't got
[2:15:04] nothing but a big
[2:15:05] dead tree and every time god sends doubt
[2:15:09] sends a big rush of glory down you just
[2:15:12] sit there and moan
[2:15:13] and say i don't believe it it's
[2:15:16] psychology
[2:15:17] it's this it's that it's this it's that
[2:15:20] we'll move
[2:15:21] he says dead from the roots twice
[2:15:24] dead plucked up by the roots it's a sad
[2:15:27] looking day when joel looked at that and
[2:15:31] saw that he said
[2:15:32] but god said i will restore

[2:15:46] was taking courage and a promise
[2:15:48] that it doesn't matter what it looks

[2:17:08] and dead sitting there moaning and
[2:17:09] groaning didn't have no life to bend
[2:17:11] with no bark on it to make it flexible

[2:17:20] happen to notice
[2:17:21] oh i love this part right here he says
[2:17:24] but i happen to notice
[2:17:26] down underneath there was some
[2:17:28] undergrowth coming up
[2:17:30] some little bushes about like that they
[2:17:33] had life in them
[2:17:34] when that wind began to hit them they
[2:17:36] was just twisting and ringing and
[2:17:38] shouting
[2:17:39] and having a glorious time let me tell
[2:17:41] you brother
[2:17:42] god's going to raise up a generation of
[2:17:46] people

[2:17:53] people
[2:17:53] who believes in signs and wonders going
[2:17:56] to raise up people
[2:17:57] who's got joy unspeakable and full of
[2:18:00] glory and when the rushing mighty wind
[2:18:02] comes it gives right into it and
[2:18:03] frolicks and dances and glorifies god
[2:18:06] hallelujah i say i'm that seed of that
[2:18:09] young bush
[2:18:10] i didn't want no dead cold formal
[2:18:12] denominationalism i didn't want a
[2:18:14] religion of a dead god or an image
[2:18:16] or an idol but i wanted the wind of the
[2:18:18] holy spirit
[2:18:19] to be able to move me
[2:18:25] oh brother madam says hallelujah green
[2:18:28] leaves clapping
[2:18:29] their hands having a wonderful time well

[2:18:46] moaning groan
[2:18:48] was giving the other one a big time and
[2:18:50] i happen to think well that's
[2:18:52] what's the what's this one doing and
[2:18:54] every time that little tree would twist
[2:18:56] what would it do it would pull the roots
[2:18:58] loosen up the ground
[2:19:00] so it could grow deeper and get a better
[2:19:02] hold

[2:24:03] made
[2:24:04] it's a promise that peter stood
[2:24:07] on the day of pentecost and said this is
[2:24:10] that
[2:24:10] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[2:24:12] but this is that which the prophet joel
[2:24:15] prophesied

[2:24:17] your old men shall see these euro men
[2:24:19] shall dream dreams
