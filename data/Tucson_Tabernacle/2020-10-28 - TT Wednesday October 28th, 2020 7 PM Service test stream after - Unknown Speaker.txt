house of the lord i greet you in the name of our precious lord jesus christ it's cold tonight but we're going to talk about that let's uh let's all pray father we're here gathered in your name the name of the lord jesus christ there's no other name like it on heaven and earth lord there's still power in that name there's still healing in that name there's still a great anointing when that name is spoken in faith lord thank you for calvary for your blood that was said for us we be so unworthy to stand here in our own righteousness lord anything that we've ever done but lord we can stand in your righteousness lord we can come boldly before your throne of grace and we're coming there tonight lord to obtain mercy and whatever of need of you know that i can't speak to these hearts but these hearts have needs lord these are your precious children the purchase of your blood and father for these needs i pray that you administered each one from your word just move supernaturally lord move me aside close my mouth my lips to speak anything but your pure word for your word is life lord it's all we need we don't need my thoughts they'll fail but your words are no never fail so lord have your way tonight anoint the ears of the years and my lips and just help us to have a wonderful time in your presence that when we leave here we can say didn't our hearts burn within us as we as you talked with us by the way thank you father trust in you in jesus name amen before you're seated let's turn to deuteronomy six and four and i was i was a little bit um wasn't totally prepared i got a the opportunities i'm happy for the opportunity to speak and always a privilege um i didn't know very long and so i'm i'm not totally prepared and so because of that i didn't get a list of scriptures to the brothers in the back and so we're just gonna uh go a little bit um whatever pace we need to go at and just we'll we'll uh enjoy what the lord has uh so my apologies though brother jeremy that i didn't get you those uh scriptures ahead of time but we'll look at deuteronomy 6 and we'll start in verse 4. it says hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and verse 5 says and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and one more scripture before you're seated let's turn to revelation the book of revelation chapter 3 and verses 14 to 16. okay verse 14 of the third chapter this is our letter amen the letter to us it says in verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou work cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth and may lord add his blessings to the reading of his word let's uh be seated please well you can you can sit down and i'll stand how's that it's good to be in his house you know it got real cold all of a sudden and just went from being 100 degrees and a couple days now i'm just shivering away and so i got got thinking about the cold and and so this is kind of the the thought that came to me is the spiritual coldness and this is something that we're really familiar with we've heard this many times this admonition to the church of the laodiceans that we uh we should not to be lukewarm the lord would rather us to be cold or hot and hot would be the best but even cold he can work with us but this lukewarm is something that we know is a very dangerous place and the condition of this age and so i know that that's very uh familiar to you but let's just take a little bit of time to to look into the word and and just look every time you look at it he can show you something new and he can he can speak straight to your heart even though i'm totally oblivious to it he can he can open something to you that you never saw before or maybe you saw before and you forgot and he can just speak right to you so let's let's just look at this little bit it says there i know thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot i would that that were cold or hot and this is you know this is talking about a spiritual temperature what's your the first thing you do generally when you go to the doctor one of the first things they do i guess first they got to get you through the paperwork so they can get their money for it but after they get all that squared away you know they take your temperature see how you're doing let's let's let's see what's going on here and so we can look at the the temperature here and so we want to see well what what is this temperature referring to and so we we kind of have an idea of of what this means and i think the idea is definitely part of it that it's easy to um envision somebody that is cold and full and you can think of kind of a you know a big formal catholic church or something like that with no emotion and just really cold and somber and so that's a part of it and you can easily think of kind of our natural opposite to that is somebody that's on fire for the lord and somebody that's just jumping and enthusiastic and amen and praise the lord and that's part of it we we uh we don't have to be statues in here we can be we can be living saints moving saints but you know if it just comes down to being able to make some noise and shake it up a little bit well then uh you know we've got no chance against the pentecostals or or a lot of these other ones you know they they'd run circles around us and you know part of that we've got to be careful because you know part of that maybe is to our shame but there's another aspect to it um there's a there's a quote that brother branham speaks in uh this world is falling apart and he says what church is he coming to the church that we're living in the laodicean church age the last church age with lukewarm just enough to dance around and say i got it i spoke in tongues i shouted hallelujah i got it so when he's talking about the lukewarm church he's actually talking about the pentecostal church that says i shouted i spoke in tongues and i got it he's actually talking about them not necessarily the cold former catholics but these ones that are saying i shouted i got it but listen he says and come back in our church is look like a bunch of jezebels see they've got the they've got the dancing they've got the speaking in tongues then they're not lining up with this see it says uh look like a bunch of jezebels look like a bunch of i don't know what corruption remember your outside expresses your inside no matter how much your testimony is your life speaks louder than your words oh and so just want to go a little bit deeper than the superficial of you know how loud can you amen and how how much of a christian you look on sundays but when the lord would take your spiritual temperature you know are you hot are you cold are you lukewarm where are you it really goes deeper than that and it goes down to to be hot is to line up with this word to be cold you might be jumping and shouting and speaking in tongues but if you're not lining up with this word of god then spiritually you're cold or even dead and then in between you've got the dangerous case where on your outside you know you may be one way or the other but the dangerous case is where when you take your temperature by the word look at your life through the word you're not totally just flat out disobeying everything you're not that cold but you're not hot you're kind of right in that middle that well i can i can get about 70 of it that's a c and c's earned degrees you know but the lord said i would that you were hot and if he if he's got that desire for us if he's if that's how he's encouraging us and calling us he's made a way for us to be there see that word there when it says hot it's not just kind of like you know a little bit better than lukewarm but that word hot if you look it up it's it's boiling hot it's gone all the way up as hot as water can go and then it's getting to the place that there's a phase transformation there's some not a not a chemical reaction but there's a there's a transition here things are going from something that's stuck in a bowl something that can fill a room there's there's something there something critical it's gone as far as it can go as a water and it's it's changing and see that's that's how we're called to live is not just in a lukewarm obedience to this word not just these varying degrees of sanctification but to live in the land the promised land of the holy ghost where you're totally you don't even look like water anymore you can't even really see steam but it's there it's it's it's out of its own rapture and that's that's what we're called to be not just you know a little bit hotter than than the pentecostals or the baptists or whatever we've got a little bit more we we follow a couple of extra scriptures we uh you know we do a little bit better at the not cutting the hair and that it's not that but are we boiling hot are we in complete obedience to this word of god this love letter that's written to us that's calling us up higher it's saying i'm not calling you to live this lukewarmness but i'm calling you to be just a boiling hot church spiritually and see once you once you look at it that way you know can i can i give my all to this jesus this living word just focus on that and then the the singing the dancing the shouting speaking in tongues that'll take care of itself see if you just focus if you try to chase that try to chase the shouting and the dancing and everything you'll get it but you might still be lukewarm you might be cold but if you'll pursue this this living word this love letter this that we've heard if you'll just surrender to it submit to it then just watch the gifts of the spirit start moving in the church you believe that see we're looking for these things we're not that's not for a different age but that that dynamic power that's for us and we'll i believe that we'll see that if we'll just keep our eyes on christ not look to these waves that are going all the way around up and down in elections and coronavirus and pandemic all this different things but just keep your eyes on the word just keep it right there you'll walk on the water see one thing about water boiling the higher you go in elevation the easier it is to boil so let's just keep on walking up up that road to glory get a little more elevation get a little closer to boiling will be changed the other thing about boiling water cleans all the trash out you could take nasty dirty deadly water just boil it it'll kill all the germs it'll go from liquid to gas and leave all the trash behind and then you can condense it and get pure distilled water that's what our lives ought to be so you won't you won't get that if you just get a little hotter if i take some you know sewage runoff or some nasty water like that i said well i i heated it up uh you know 120 degrees 150 you want some it's pretty warm no way to see if you'll take whatever dirty water and you'll boil it you can get crystal clean pure water that's what our lives need to be there's there's a big difference between being totally surrendered to being a little bit warmer there's a world of difference there so let's just look into the word and see see what this is about one thing let's just leave that up there one thing you'll notice is that it says i know thy works that they aren't neither cold nor hot see it's not it's not saying that he knows your your song or your your demeanor how you look it doesn't even say i know your heart see a lot of times we say well it's just in the heart and so you know my my my heart is right with god and that's all that matters but he doesn't even say i know your heart that's colder i thought he says i know your works because your works will declare what your heart really is and the heart is deceitfully wicked who can know it and so if you try to look at your heart you can end up fooling yourselves but what the lord is saying here your works will declare see your works are are they are they judged by the word to line up or do your works show that we've cooled off a little bit that we've lost our first love a little bit and we need to need some help i need a lot of help but he's he's faithful faithful is he that started the work to finish it the same one that lit that fire underneath my pot of water he's faithful to take it to boiling and see i might i might uh run around and mess things up slow things down but if he's determined that i'm going to boil nothing can separate us from that love of god and it says no creature i look a lot like a creature sometimes but i guess i fall into that that not even myself can separate that seed of god that he placed in me from his great love that he purposed in the beginning amen so he's looking at our works to see what our temperature is um so we're looking here at uh you know we're looking a little deeper than the emotion but at the same time we uh we want to be emotion uh we want to be zealous i think i thought of in the old testament where that was there was that king and the prophet said you know take these arrows and smite the ground and he he just smote the ground a couple times and the prophet rebuked him and said you know if you'd taken that and you you'd really done it with all your heart you would have utterly destroyed the enemy because you did it three times you'll defeat them only three times and so i don't want to you know you've got to keep your balance in the word and i don't want to say it's all just doctrinal and it's all just about you know how you align with the word because there is a component of this that is talking about zeal and we know that the word teaches us that whatever your hand finds to do you should do it with all your heart and so don't let me suggest that this is uh saying that you can be on fire for god and and uh it'd be totally uh just um an inward thing it's not a not just an inward thing it'll it'll manifest on the outside and we ought to have a zeal for the house of the lord but um we know that the word talks about the love of many waxing cold and so your works and your love they're kind of related because there's kind of a chain here but your works are your faith expressed right and your faith works by love so in the line here there's love there's faith and there's works and so your your works are your faith expressed and your faith works by love and so you can see that if your love is to grow cold as the word talks about then your works will no longer align with the word of god because of that in between that your faith will decrease and we know that everything in this age the the devil's plan we know is is just aimed at your faith to get you to disbelieve the word of god to get you to disbelieve that his promises are true and not just that they're true but they're for you that they're not just for the person in the pew next to you but that this is a personal letter that he wrote to you personal promises that he's made to you as his child and so we know that that's the the focus of the enemy is to destroy that faith that link between your love and your works and because it then he'll get you in a spiral that once your once your faith fails your works fail then you get caught up looking at that you stop thinking about the promises of god you stop thinking about the goodness of god all you see is your fallen faith in your fallen works and when you're looking at that your love gets even colder see he gets you looking at that failure and then it gets into this vicious cycle where everything's just coming down coming down see but we've got a promise that in this day we'd be restored back to the faith of the fathers and that was a perfect faith see praise the lord let's read that in matthew 24 12. where it says the the faith of many we wax cold matthew 24 and verse 12. this is talking about the last um you know the the signs of the times this is the portion where the disciples are saying what is the sign of your coming and at the end of the world and this is where jesus is talking about nations rising against nations and and all these things uh false prophets rising and deceiving money and then in verse 12 he says and because iniquity will abound the love of many shall wax cold it says in verse 13 though but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved so we can see that there's this time that we're living in that iniquity is going to be just cooling down the love that's what i wanted to talk about today is just a little title cold love that's what's causing the the works of this layer to see in church to be lukewarm is because this iniquity this sin this unbelief that's in the land is causing the love of many to wax cold it's just like when you're you might be on you might be nice and warm and then you go out into a blizzard you fall in some water and you know you were nice and warm but it doesn't take long for those surroundings to affect your internal temperature see temperature is contagious just like the coronavirus temperature doesn't keep to itself but if you bring two things together that are different temperatures the temperatures are both going to change the hot one's going to get colder the cold one's gonna get hotter and eventually if you keep them together they'll meet in the middle and so if we were just to be [Music] heated up one time even to boiling and then you were to take and put yourself in this age full of iniquity and if you're just to leave that there just sit yourself here left left to the natural progression of the way the laws of nature work you would eventually come and be your your temperature difference would be totally neutralized you would come just to an equilibrium that there would be that would just keep sucking the temperature out of you until you were the same temperature as the world if if all that it was is that you are heated once and uh and put there but i'm so glad that that's not the way that the lord has designed our body to work we're not something that's just heated once but we're on fire we've got a living burning holy ghost inside the church inside each believer and that's not just a hot temperature but that's a energy provider that's something that the the devil can't put out see there's there's two kinds of creatures in this world really there's cold-blooded and warm-blooded there's there's the reptiles and the snakes and the creepy crawlies that if their surroundings are cold their internal temperature will be cold also if you take a snake or a lizard or whatever and put them somewhere cold there's nothing they can do about it they're just going to slow down not going to have many works and that's what the devil wishes we were like because if he could just get us to just absorb this iniquity that's blanketing this age our love would grow cold but the lord also designed in his goodness and his grace creatures that can generate their own heat but i can take some nutrients i can take a sandwich or a steak or something like that and i can eat it and by the processes that the lord has designed inside of me i can be in a snow bank i can be in a cold river and i can still be generating heat and and still be warm you have people that will go and and take an ice bath or something like that and they don't freeze but they're they're triumphant over it see and now this one's going to sound a little bit different but stay with me there's another way to stay warm and that's to get really drunk there's a there's a man this is a true story one of the survivors of the titanic which the titanic went down and they said the water was about 28 degrees so below freezing just frigidly cold icebergs and everybody it was so cold that some of the older people that would end up in the water their heart would just stop right away just give them a heart attack and just kind of like this age so cold with iniquity it it could just stop your heart right away just so bad and so all these people a lot of them that ended up in the water when the ship went down it wasn't so much that they were drowning but it was that brutal cold that was just destroying them and you know 15 minutes you could end up dead but there was one man and he probably never guessed when he did this that he'd end up in a sermon but he decided when the ship was going down he was just gonna get good and drunk and he got good and drunk and he stayed on the boat and the boat went down and he just kind of stepped off at the end and he says that he survived two hours because he was just so full of this this drink inside him see and it sounds kind of ridiculous but we ought to be drunk with the spirit of god we're supposed to be undigging undignified we don't we don't care that the ships of the world this country whatever is going down we're not concerned with that we're not concerned with the temperature of the water but we've got we're just drunk on the spirit of god that that just calms our nerves they said that's the trick to it how that this man was probably able to survive is that everyone else that went into the water they're all flailing they're panicking and what that's doing is distributing the heat really quick they're getting a lot of cold water all over each limb but see this man he was just satisfied and calm with this that he'd been drinking and so when he went in he just was kind of bobbing around he just weathered the the cold and everything that pulled him out and um you know a very absurd example but let me read you a quote just so you don't throw me out of here okay this is from an exodus it says notice and when they were all eating that manna they got drunk just as drunk as they could be and were staggering like drunk men and listen my catholic friend the virgin mary was with them and she had to get that before she entered heaven how much more are you gonna have to get that that's right you know what the trouble today the reason we're so allergic to many things we don't get drunk enough you believe that i believe it was william booth cleveland one day said in the early salvation army days of england he missed his train one night he had to walk up and down the streets and he walked with a cop been raining an old drunk was laying in the street just as drunk and froze the street and he said to call the paddy bag and he came picked up the drunk and pushed him out of there he said what will you do to him why i said we'll just take him down and throw him in the jug he said well what just aren't you going to take care of him said he don't need no help why the man why i said the man will take pneumonia he said i guess if you took him to the salvation army you'd pat him up a little warm him up and give him hot coffee in a hot bath all those things he said sure that's the reason you'd kill him he said you know what the people don't understand but the man so drunk every pore of his skin is filled with whiskey said they can't no cold get into him and the bible said be not drunk upon strong drinks which is to excess but be drunk on the spirit what's the matter today we ought to get so drunk till our carcasses would be so full of the holy ghost that nothing else could perch in the way the trouble is in trouble that is that we don't get a good old-fashioned pentecostal drunk amen that's right so i hope you'll forgive me for that that's titanic story but if we're drunk on the spirit of god this iniquity that's around the ship that's going down we can still have a fire inside it won't be the fire or whiskey but it'll be the fire of the holy ghost so we want to look at the love of many is waxing cold because of iniquity well this iniquity is sin or disobedience so we want to look and see have we been affected by this spirit of iniquity in this age so we could go through and we could look at the different commandments we could evaluate our spiritual temperature but let's just take one exodus 20 and verses one to three we'll just we don't have time to go through all the commandments but let's just take a temperature here really quick exodus 20 verse 1 and god spake all these words saying i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt and out of the house of bondage now here's the first i shall have no other gods before me see that's that's the first of the ten commandments we learned that as a as children we got our ten dollar bill from brother green when he was giving those out say we're way past that this one this one's an easy one to to let get a little bit cold as the times go by see idolatry was one of these recurring themes in the old testament one of these the most common of the transgressions that israel would find themselves in and it wasn't that they totally would turn from god but they just have other gods side gods and it's so easy to fall into that that's the spirit of this age is the gods of of the riches of this this world it talks and we'll read a little later or in the rest of the message but it talks about how the laodicean church was rich and had need of nothing so materialistic so looking at their gold and their silver and their their fine clothes that they had other gods they still would go to church and still would worship jehovah but they had these other gods and it's so easy for that to come in and and to just start cooling off your love see solomon the wisest man that the world's ever seen outside of jesus christ he was so wise and his heart was right before the lord and he just started taking in these other gods to appease his wife's and it was the ruin of him and if we're not careful this same thing is trying to ruin us in this day to get us to look not at the love of our hearts our our our soul mate but to give most of it to him and just let these other little gods creep up these cares of the world these different things these things that you've got to do just to be accepted in the world to be sociable you can't just have your mind on jesus all the time that's fine now and again but just relax sometime and and uh you know have some other things to spend your time and you know you can be you can be 95 percent about jesus but just have another 5 of something else that's it's so sneaky but then that five percent grows to seven to nine and the next thing you know that's all you can think about it's so easy to have your mind captured by imaginations of things that are not even bad but they're other gods there's something that comes between you and your time with your maker we can check our temperature how is our love is our love like that first love where he just said lord you're everything to me nothing else in this world matters all this is just gonna pass away it's a vapor my life is a vapor see no man can serve two masters either a loved one and hate the other and king of your life to be yourself and you can do that and still be a really convincing christian you can have you know i can have peter mcfadden be the lord of my life and i can still come to church i can still say amen i can still be moved by the spirit i could speak in tongues and maybe you couldn't tell the difference maybe i couldn't tell the difference but the lord sees the hearts and he knows if you have any other gods before him you can't you can't serve god and mammon a hard scripture but it's true luke 14 and 25. and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if a man if any man come to me and hate not his father or mother and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea in his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple we don't like to read that one a lot because it kind of baffles us i thought we're supposed to be good fathers i suppose thought we were supposed to honor our our parents you know i thought we were supposed to care about our own selves but it's very clear that if in comparison to god you don't hate everything else he said you can't even be my disciple see that's that's part of the gospel you shall have no other gods beforehand lord help us help me where i've gotten cold there help me where i've put my family before you because see here's the thing is that if you'll leave father and mother houses and lands and everything for the sake of this gospel for the sake of his kingdom he will take care of your family he'll take care of you see that which you try to save you lose and that which you give away you say lord i'll lose it for your kingdom he'll save you can't save your family by putting them before god but you have to leave your family for god leave everything for him and just let him save your loved ones let him take care of it let let him use you to provide for your family say well i've gotta i've gotta give my life to my job because i've gotta be a provider for my family if i don't i'm worse than an infidel don't put that before god if you give your everything to god the bible says i've never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed go begging for bread your children will have provision if you go and leave everything for the kingdom but if you don't they might have shoes and food and everything like that but spiritually you won't be able to provide for them and they could end up starving there and then in that way you can end up in a much worse condition so even though it seems hard you just have to trust him you just have to trust that everything that he does is in love is perfect his ways are above our ways don't try to reason it out but just say lord every day you are god be god of my whole life don't let me have any other gods before you so that's one commandment we could go through more but that first one's see jesus said there's all these different commandments but he said on on these two commandments love the lord thy god with all thy heart soul mind strength and body love thy neighbor as thyself so that hang all the law and prophets on that and so when you want to take a temperature just look at those two things don't try to evaluate well have i uh you know you should evaluate all the other things but just look at that and pray before the lord say lord am i loving you with everything and am i loving nate my neighbor as myself use that as a chap cup and that's how you see if you're getting a little bit cool if you're cooling off a little bit not necessarily whether you're shouting and jumping but just as your life cooling off or other things coming in or the cares of the world coming in um i was listening to a sermon of brother greene my truck's real old and so it does some funny things and one of the funny things that it does that i really like is that it'll just randomly start playing rather green i'll be uh i'll be listening to the radio or something and i've got a cd in there i'll go for a bump or i'll turn it on or whatever and then all of a sudden it's just for the green instead of the radio oh okay guess i guess it's time to listen to this but i was listening to him and it made he was talking about just being so caught up with the different people that would always be calling him and trying to you know seek counsel from him and different things and it was just weighing so heavy on him it was just really wearing him down and he was talking about how you you've got to sometimes just even unplug the phone back when they had cordless phones some of you can remember that you know other other people it's good to help other people to have a heart for other people you have to but don't let that come before god even see one of the things brother green had to learn and i i wanted to find it i couldn't find it i'd i'd like to play it but um maybe you remember where brother green had the lord spoke to him and told him a couple things i wish i knew exactly what it was but my recollection of it which maybe one of you can correct me on exactly what it was but basically i think the lord told him to you know dial back on the things that were taking his time and energy and to sweeten his life in prayer so i think it was something along the lines of rid yourself rid your life for the things that are taking all this time and energy and sweeten your life in prayer and i thought that was really good i was thinking of there's a story in the old testament where the the prophet was going somewhere and the lord told him you know salute no man by the way and and so it seemed so very odd to us we think that we've always got to be so friendly to one another and and we can just we can end up putting that before god we're trying to please each other trying to cater to what one another wants to do and you know please this one please that one but the lord told him you know salute no man by the way and he ended up not listening to that and he there's this other uh character that ended up getting him to come and and um have a meal and he ended up i think he got eaten by lions or he ended up dying and uh just a reminder that the first priority should just be to please the lord jesus even if it means looking unfriendly and rude it's not about just blindly going and giving your energy sometimes you can you can end up casting your pearls before swine and you can end up just hurting your relationship with the lord because you're too busy trying to do it your own way but when jesus went the lord moved used him like there was never a human used but it was very targeted he did only the things that the father showed him see there were many at the pool of bethesda he went to one he walked by all the others you know these mothers and these old men many people would say how could you jesus hold on this other guy he's been here for 40 years but the lord knows the lord has a perfect plan there are many widows in the days of elijah he went to one and so sometimes you can even just get so caught up trying to to spread yourself so thin just trying to save the whole world but the pattern set in the bible is just to be your eyes totally on him totally surrendered to him totally open however the spirit of god would move you and then you don't have to go and try to figure it out and work it out he can just put you right there where he's already been working on the other end and just he can do the miraculous but it's important just to keep him first and then everyone else and not everyone else and then him so um i think we kind of spent a while on that let's let's talk about there's two ways to get into a lukewarm condition uh the first one is you're never boiling hot in the first place a lot of people kind of get started off and then they stop short they never fully surrender they never fully fall in love with lord like peter he was with the lord and outwardly he looked like he was on more on fire than maybe the rest of them he said lord i'll die for you look see my sword i am i am a disciple number one you know he was he was a big bold brash the lord said he wasn't even converted so a lot he he at that point he wasn't fully boiling hot even though he thought he was and so you ended up denying the lord so that's one way that you can end up to be in a lukewarm condition the other is that you were there but then just this iniquity has caused the love of many to wax cold like the ephesian church age and you've lost your first love but in both of those cases i was so encouraged by this in both the case of peter and the ephesian church age the lord was there to bring the temperature up to make a temperature change see on the one hand the one that was never fully there the word says that all that the father hath given will come see he's got a plan for each one for peter he had ordained for peter to to be changed and peter was changed then after that he was on fire he was bold he gave his whole life for the gospel his love was such that he said don't even crucify me in the manner my lord was crucified crucify me upside down i'm not even worthy to be crucified like him you know he he was he got the temperature turned up there he got to boiling and then with the the fusion church age the scripture that comes to mind is that he said he won't lose a one so if he's ever got a hold of one of his even though that one might backslide a little bit cool off a little bit have some other gods come in he's not going to lose one of his and um in revelation 2 4 and 5 where it's talking there to the ephesian church age we always we always reference the part where it says you lost your first love but if you read on a little bit revelation chapter 2 and verse 4 and 5 he says nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love and then he says remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except our repen so he didn't just say ephesus you've you've blown it but he said ephesus come on let's come back to those first works come repent he's always drawing uh back back to himself so we can see uh the reason for this lukewarm condition in both cases is is this iniquity this this cooling off we know that the only sin is really unbelief and that's why our love can grow cold is that we don't trust that his promises are true we don't trust that they're for us and so we just get a little bit cold but the lord's lord's gracious that he doesn't just diagnose you but he prescribes a treatment for you he doesn't just say well you're you're cooled off and i'm going to spew you from my mouth period but look what it goes on to say let's let's go to revelation 3 and we'll read on where we left off we uh we'll read we'll reread it again let's start in 14. uh revelation 3 and 14 and we'll read down through 22 then unto the angel of the church of laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold or hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knows not that they are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now he's going to say three things to get out of this condition listen i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i sath that thou mayest see see the three things by me gold and white raymond and anoint on eyes with isa so we're going to look just a little bit into that we've got a little bit of time left so we'll go quickly as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent so all is not lost even if we find ourselves in this lukewarm condition the lord has has given us a prescription and he's saying this is this chastisement is from love be zealous therefore and repent he says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh while i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen so we'll we'll just go quickly here but these three things the first one by gold and we reminded me of in isaiah 55 and 1 familiar scripture to us the lord says let me find it here isaiah 55 1 he says ho everyone that thirsteth coming to the waters and he that hath no money coming by and eat yay come buy wine and milk without money and without price and so we know that the lord is uh calling us to come and buy from him and here he's saying buy me gold dried by fire and what i what i thought here is they were so concerned with the natural things the laodiceans they were so concerned with the outward appearances and and their fine robes and everything that they didn't know that spiritually they were totally lacking totally um just naked but we know in the bible that it talks about seeking seeking the heavenly treasure those things valuing these these promises of god these uh this promised land of of um you know the the book of ephesians you know our promised land to go through we know that that these things of god and the person of jesus christ that ought to be our pearl of great price and so when you're gold when your treasure that you're looking at is the things of this world you're never going to be happy and you're never going to have a love for god that's hot and on fire your works are not going to be on fire because your treasure is on earth and our treasure ought not to be on earth not even in this earth but our treasure is spiritual in in the heavenly in in your spiritual walk with lord the treasures of his character and his love uh in in colossians 3 verses 1 to 4. we'll read colossians chapter 3 wonderful it says if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things of the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god when christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory so our gold our treasure ought to be on the things that are above and then in first peter 1 and 3 to 9 it says blessed be the god and father our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead see we're looking on the things that are above we're setting our affections on what he's done we're believing his promises to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you which are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold which perisheth that will be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the peering of our lord jesus of jesus christ so see the treasures are not the treasures of the latest sins the golden ladocians but the promises of god even the trials and the testing that the lord has put us through that's the gold that we buy from him is is those those spiritual treasures and as as that's our goal as that's our treasure then our faith and our love will grow and grow warm and and grow to boiling see what it says next is whom having not seen talking about jesus christ ye love see as you look on these things as you trust that your trials are to bring you to perfection that makes you more in love with him having not seen ye love in whom though ye see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls so that's the the first one is to buy gold of him the second one is white raymond and in we know that the ephesian church was naked and it's easy to get cold when you're naked but we know we're to be clothed on with this word with the promises with the character with the life of god we're to have that wedding garment that he's provided but we've got to put it on we know we've got to be washed with the water of the word and we know that as as we let that word minister to us it'll increase our love our faith it'll make our hearts burn just like the ones on the road to emmaus they said didn't our hearts burn within us as he talked with us by the way that he was expounding the scriptures and so as we as we stay just constantly in that word or this white raiment that we've been given to put on as we stay in that word then that's going to quicken our faith quicken our love and and our our will be on fire but we've got to submit to it we've got to not just hear it three times in in the new testament the bible commands the wives to submit to their husbands and that's not just in the natural but that's we as the bride of christ have got to submit to this word three times it says that that we've really got to submit to that word um the word washes away the sin from our lives the leprosy but jesus you know told the prophet told name and go wash wash in the water and your leprosy will be gone away and as the lord takes your sins away just makes you love him more and more but we've got to be uh we've got to be zealous and applying the word when you when you think of the example of how how should we uh how zealous should we be to clean up this temple based on his word we get the example of jesus with a whip driving out all the money changers all these other gods of of gold and silver that had come up in the temple of god that's how we ought to be and just zealous that the zeal of our father's house is eating us up so that's the second one the white raymond and then the third one is i sav i was thinking of uh you know if you if you look naturally it's easy to end up discouraged to let your faith grow cold to let your love grow cold to end up in a lukewarm condition if you look naturally but we've got to have eyes have we've got to say lord open my eyes that i can see spiritually just like elisha and the servant the lord opened his eyes and then he could see what was going on and then he went from discouraged and oh we're going to lose to he had he had victory he had i would imagine he had an increased love for the lord because he could see that the lord had not left him sometimes you think the lord has left you but just look to the spiritual say lord open my eyes give me eyes have to see that you have not left me you never neither leave me or nor forsake me but your promises are true if you can just look spiritually and you can meditate on the things of god just like the blind man that the lord spit on clay and put it on his eyes and gave him new eyes the lord is still opening the eyes of the vine and he's opening our eyes that we can meditate on the things of god first timothy 4 and 14. says oh 15 sorry it says meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy prophecy profiting may appear to all if you want to fall more in love with the lord if you want to increase your faith meditate on these things just like david was always pondering the things of the lord in his heart you hear you don't hear a lot about meditation these days the the world has gone and taken meditation something totally different but a believer's meditation is on the things of god and on the word of god on the promises of god that just let those let those flow through your mind and through your spirit and it'll give you a joy and a love that'll encourage you and and get you on fire for the lord you can think about how he's predestinated you chosen you before the foundation of the world how he's fearfully and wonderfully made you you can behold what manner of love the father has given to us that we should be called the sons of god you can meditate on those things and the eye salve allows you to walk by faith and not by sight as a story that all i'll share as we're closing kind of along those lines of walking by faith and not by sight there's a time that nobody had ever flown across the atlantic ocean before flying was new and they were still trying to stay close to land so they didn't end up in the in the water and so there was a man that was going to go and he was going to try to do what nobody had done before and fly across the atlantic ocean and his name was charles lindbergh and he did it he went farther than anyone had ever gone that way but what he did that allowed him to do it where i believe others had tried and probably failed but what he did is he realized that he was going to need a lot of gasoline to make it across this was such a far journey for him to go and so what he chose to do is he had a special built plane just for this flight he called it the spirit of st louis and he built this plane he needed so much gas that the only place that he could put it is right in the front so you've got to get the balance all right put it right in the front where usually your window would be to see out the front because he he knew that he needed more the gasoline than even that he needed to see in front of him because he could trust his instruments he could trust what was going on inside or he knew the gasoline would take him there and he just said i don't even need to see it i'm going all the way what a type for us we're not on the spirit of saint louis but we're we're going by the spirit of jesus christ farther than anyone's ever gone before this isn't an age that we need to see out the front window even though we're going somewhere no one's our our captain has gone before but we can say just fill the plane with the power that's all i want i don't need to see out but just pack that plane full of power and let's go anoint our eyes with eyes have that we can see by faith the musicians would come if we'll do these things if we'll buy gold if we'll buy this white raymond and if we'll anoint our eyes with i salve that we can see him and our love will grow then that love will change our works it'll change the way that we act just i want to be changed i want the lord to to be able to look at my works and say peter mcfadden is boiling hot not by anything that he's done but by the grace that's been given to him he's walked in the way walked in the way the lord's provided and my my desire is just to hear him say well done one of these days and i don't believe that that's something that's just reserved for brother branham and paul but just play something softly if you would but if we'll just give our lives to this word if we'll have no other gods before him i believe we can each hear him say well done one of these days it's not by our own strength or by our power but it's by his grace that he'll take us and make us what we need to be he'll take us through that that uh phase transformation from water to steam he's he's got the power he's got the gas how many wants to be on fire more more in love with him let's just pray lord jesus your word is life to us in this age that all we can see everywhere is just death spiritual death and iniquity lord even if we look in ourselves so often we see just such iniquity and such blackness such unbelief the lord in your word we see that there's a chosen one a bride that's washed that's sanctified it's baptized with your spirit or a wife that submits to her husband and everything we want to be that wife lord we want to be submitted to your word we want to be more in love with you than we've ever been lord for those of us lord that have been boiling in the past and maybe have cooled down a little bit lord would you just bring us back to boiling lord help us father and maybe some here i don't know but maybe some have never been boiling hot lord would you convert their hearts lord would you just quicken us bring us up to that boiling point we want to serve you lord we don't want to play your church or we don't want to just give part to you and hold part back but lord we want to go all the way i want to give up our own sight and just be filled with your spirit help us father you're the one that gives sight to the blind strength of the weary lord or we've messed things up and just made a mess of things lord would you make everything beautiful in your time as you said you would we love you and give you thanks lord bless each one father as we go our different ways help us in jesus name amen sing that song oh lord you're beautiful oh lord your beauty your face is all i seek and where your eyes are on this child [Music] your grace [Music] your face is all i see and when your eyes are on this child your grace abounds to

dreams god is moving by his spirit moving me just a one announcement for sunday brother david gadman will be with us on sunday so just be keeping that in prayer and look forward to having each one of

be removed this mountain shall be removed [Music] do [Music] you
