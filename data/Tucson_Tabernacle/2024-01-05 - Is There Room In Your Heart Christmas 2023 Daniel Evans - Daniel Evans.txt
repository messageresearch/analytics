Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who was called Christ so all the generations from Abraham to David are 14 generations and from David until the carrying away into Babylon our 14 generations and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ Our 14 Generations now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord by the prophet saying behold diversion shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emanuel which being interpreted is god with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and he knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and called his name Jesus [Applause] and Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judea when King when Herod was King behold there came three wise men from the East to Jerusalem seeking the Messiah where's the newborn king we seen a star in the east we come to worship Him where's the Messiah to be born in Bethlehem as the prophet Micah said so when did the star appear search for the young child tell me when you find him because I also want to worship Him the wise men left King Herod and followed the star to where Jesus and his mother were they fell down and worshiped him and gave him gifts when they they left Jesus they did not return to Jerusalem to tell King Herod because God had warned them not to [Applause] [Music] no the and lo [Music] St are they pass [Music] Sil [Music] night night all is all is bright [Music] round and child holy and so tender and

we're in the closing hours of time and it's a great honor that we can stand before all that the devil has to offer and we can stand for something that's true um before I forget uh as you're leaving today I I got a Stephanie and I got a little present for the kids um brother brandom used us to he used to give a candy cane and an orange uh after Christmas service every year at the brandom Tabernacle and uh I don't think in Orange is maybe as coveted today as it used to be so we went ahead and and got the candy cane and uh instead of the orange we got the kids a little Bible and it's got just certain scriptures in it that really tells God's story from the beginning to the end so this is for the the youth and uh we only we only have 60 of them so if we could just keep it to the kids it doesn't matter if you identify as a kid you're still not a kid yeah we can get started on that type of thing but but uh yeah for the kids when you leave get your candy cane and your little bible again that's that's from Stephanie and my and me just to tell you tell you we love you there's a there's a legend of a candy cane I'll read it real quick it's it says this the candy cane is not an ordinary treat it holds a Christmas message of love that is oh so sweet the cane reminds me of his Shepherd staff a way provided for eternity on my behalf turn the cane around and the Jay you will see Jesus my Savior was born to set me free the red is symbolic of the blood of Christ shed the price of my sin that he bore instead the white represents life made new God's gift through Christ's birth birth for me and for you a little story about about the candy cane I I don't know if if uh it's actually true it could have been written by some Pastor that just wanted to give his church candy canes but uh I found it found it on a little card and I I thought I'd share it with with with the Saints here let's read our our Christmas Story I appreciate the kids and and all that went in to doing that that play we have uh of course sister Jessica and and all the works she put in Sister Angela with the little ones my wife Stephanie sister Heather thanks to everyone that participated in that let's give them a hand and say thank you you did a very very nice job it it was it was definitely a blessing um I also want to point out that uh today it um it's probably a hard day for for some people that Generations pretty much pass now but today is the day that brother Brown passed away in 1965 on Christmas Eve I want to want to remember that um Luke Chapter 2 A Familiar Story start with verse one says this and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this ta taxing was first made when cenius was the governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea under the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were soore afraid and the angel said said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you and you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and good and peace and on Earth peace peace and Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into the heaven that the shepherd said one to another let us go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and they found Mary and Joseph and the Babe laying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told them what a what a beautiful story and I chose to read this story out of Luke it's told in in two different books I told I uh chose to read this story out of Luke because the kids told the story out of Matthew with the wise men thinking about last night I was thinking about these Shepherds and how they must have felt imagine they were just out tending their sheep and then everything in their lives changed and I was thinking about the poorness of a shepherd and and the kind of person that was a shepherd back then is the same kind today we have an image in our mind of what a Shepherd is and and what these Shepherds were there when those angels came to them we we think of them as as probably cleancut men that were out there tending the sheep and were maybe praying and reading their Bibles or something on on that order maybe well to-do people but they were not well to-do people these were the poorest of the poor I was in East Africa a few years ago and my brother Adam and I were doing a project there and we were out in the in the bush of Africa and we saw this herd of goats come by and there was a shepherd with them guiding this flock and it really got to my brother Adam Adam saw him walking by and the man he had a staff he had a a pair PA of shorts on that I'm sure used to be pants but they were so ragged holes in them and so thin he was walking along I don't remember if he had a shirt on or not but he had one rubber boot on one foot and and his other foot was just bare just barefooted and he had a stick in his hand and he was walking and he was limping as he was tending this this herd of goats and my brother he couldn't handle it he just broke down so he talked with the the brother that was with us that was a native and he said I want to buy this man a pair of shoes and we're out in the middle of nowhere so the uh the the brother that was with us he said okay and Adam said how many how much money would it be and I think it was 20 or $30 he thought for a nice pair of shoes that he could buy in the nearby um village So Adam gave it to um the African brother the African brother changed it to the native currency and the two of them walked over to the shepherd and the shepherd looked he never seen a white man before and he saw him coming up and and my brother's a pretty in intimidating site if you know him he's a big man so it was it was probably a little bit scary seeing this this big white guy come up and and and thinking okay what's going to happen here and and he was a little he was a little frightened and and the the translator told him that this man from America wants to help you he wants to buy you a pair of shoes because he sees that you're limping and the shepherd He looked and and brother sedi the the man that was with us he pulled out the money and the shepherd just started shaking he never seen that much money before and he he he didn't understand why someone would be so kind to him and he he gave him the money and he he thanked him and and as he was walking off he kept looking back at us like like what had just happened when I was watching all this unfold I thought that man is a very very poor man that man if if we would meet him we would consider him kind of just a more of a loser in life and that's that's how these Shepherds were they weren't these respected people that we think so much these were the lowest of the low they were they were just barely surviving and their livelihood was this flock and it wasn't their flock they were working for somebody that had more money that was able to give them just some food basically and that was how they ate was was the little bit that they made and you think of these Angels coming down to these Shepherds why did they choose Shepherds why would they choose these people that are nobody's in life why would they choose them to announce the coming of the Messiah you would think it would go to a king or something like that but it was because these simple people out in the desert watching these sheep these simple people had room in their heart as the song says they had had room to accept something that was a gift something that was new something that not may not have been some expensive or great um thing that the world would see but a child in this cave the parents didn't even have enough money to do anything there's a there's a scripture in the Bible that says that they brought when they when they brought Jesus to be um dedicated they brought two doves you know why they brought two doves the custom was to bring a lamb but the law made it a way for those that didn't have enough money to afford a lamb which would been of the respectful type of of sacrifice for their child which would have been something that they could have been proud of the the law gave away for just to buy these two cheap Little D doves and offer that and that's what Jesus was offered when he was dedicated because they couldn't afford something more and how why would God come to these men out in the field is because as I said there was some room in their heart for God to speak and to tell that story and then they went out and they told the story it didn't matter if it was if it was this baby that was in this in this eating trough with some some towels maybe that they pulled off that probably weren't even clean that they pulled off a some sort of of work um animal and put him there and put the baby there they didn't care that it was maybe an unsanitary condition a Shepherd like that wouldn't care in the least but a Shepherd would see that as as this is is great and they would understand and they would receive that angel at the same time that this was happening there in this city this town of Bethlehem hundreds of miles away maybe thousands of miles away there were a few men that came from this this lineage of people this mysterious lineage of people called the Magi we call them the Magi sometimes in the in the text they were called the calans they were called also the M magicians but these people they were studying a prophet's message this prophet's name was Daniel do you remember the story of Nebuchadnezzar the king how Nebuchadnezzar came in to Jerusalem and he took all of the captive captive and he brought them back to Babylon you remember that story and they brought this young man named Daniel this young man named Daniel was a prophet he had a gift in his life so he's there now in Babylon cap captive this King Nebuchadnezzar has a bad dream wakes up he was terrified this dream had left him but he knew that he had a dream so he calls his Magis his wise men this mysterious group of people and he says here's the deal he says I had a dream and I need you to tell me what that dream is they said okay tell us the dream he says now here's the deal you're going to have to tell me what I dreamed these Magi were like hey we can't do that only God can do that he says let me put it this way if you don't do it then you're all going to die you're all going to be executed why would I want to have the these great people if you can't do what you're supposed to do so they were they were wiggling probably like a worm in a Limon ex nervous not knowing they're thinking they're going to die the whole race is going to be wiped out because this king is angry and then this man named Daniel he comes and he says word gets to him that they're all going to be put to death he says I'll tell the king So Daniel Comes in and tells the king not only his dream but gives him the interpretation of it so what does the king do he makes Daniel the ruler over the Magi that was 600 years before Jesus came and this group of men we call the wise man they are from that origin in that area across the world so they had studied because Daniel was the chief they had studied all that this man Daniel had written and they were watching for a sign Daniel told them after this many generations or this many years that this man the Messiah was going to come so they were studying and they were looking and they were watching the stars because that's how they told time that's how they could measure how many months or years it had been so then these men they see a sign a star that they have never seen they see it in the sky and they knew they knew Daniel probably taught them the prophecy of balum saying a star would rise out of Jacob he probably taught them the the Prophecies of of Micah and the different ones that this this man would come and deliver Israel and he would come out of this place called Bethlehem so they see this star and I wonder everybody you you see on the on the different things that they're trying to nail down what that star was and well these Stars would have come together maybe 2,000 years ago whatever it was it was something that struck them I wonder if I don't know this but I wonder if it could have just been the shikina go glory of God that came down in a star and rested over this child Jesus and they saw it so then they get on the road and they go and they're following the star as I said it was it was hundreds or thousands of miles it took them more than a year to get there they saw a sign but notice that just because they saw a sign they didn't stop and rejoice and jump up and down that we saw the sign everything's going to be okay no they saw the sign and they say we're going to follow the sign and we're going to keep going so they kept going on the road and they came to this city Jerusalem star went out they were respected people obviously so they get there and they start asking asking where is he I was born King of the Jews because we have come to worship him where this gets back to Herod and Herod starts looking at everything that's going on and there wasn't room in this man herod's heart let me read it we already read it before but let's read it again Matthew chapter 2 verse one now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men out of the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that born King of the Jews for we have seen a star in the east and come to worship him when Herod the king heard these things he was troubled and Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes and people together he demanded of them where Christ should be be born and they said unto him Bethlehem of Judea for this is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem of J in the land of Judah Art Thou Art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time that star had appeared think about that and how that these wise men it was everything to them to get to this child this Messiah it was everything that that ever they had ever been taught and they must have been so honored that 600 years of generations comes down and we get to see him we get to see this great child that came to save man from his sins I think about through Jesus's life from his birth all the way to his death and I think about who had the most faith in the prophet's messages think about that think about as as Jesus was born in all the characters we have the wise men and we have we have the Shepherds and then and then later on we we have Mary and Joseph there and then later on we have Peter and James and John and all the disciples and Mary and and and the different ones and Martha who and Joseph of arthea towards in who had the greatest faith in what the prophet's messages were who do you think who would be a good example of having faith believing believing the prophet's messages who somebody somebody tell me what who do you think give me who Peter yeah Peter Peter's a good one I have somebody in my mind Peter's a good one gave giving him the kings of the the keys to the kingdom but no not Peter give me another another guess somebody else who John the Beloved disciple how could you have greater belief than John nope not John who Paul Paul had the greatest revelation of them all that's a great thought nope even close somebody else well besides Jesus yeah it's all about him Tony the Shepherds yeah they were told and they went nope come on more who the Magi because they believed you're close but no no this is so obvious how could you not guess it who sister Grace Elias Noy Mary the Mother not even close Mary questioned the the angel came to Mary and she said well how can this be who Joseph yeah he didn't question like Mary did it's a good one nope stole my thunder who had more faith who believed more than Herod think no I'm talking Herod Herod is the answer Herod when these wise men came they came to Herod and Herod said what a king I'm the king and they came to they came to him and he said wait wait wait wait wait exactly when did you see this star the star shall rise a star of Jacob when did you see this star watch what Herod was doing Herod believed Herod believed in this prophecy so he goes and he starts researching this then he goes to his priests and he says now where is this Messiah supposed to come to they said Bethlehem it's written in Micah okay so he takes he takes that and he takes over here with the mag eyes Herod believed but then every demon in hell was using Herod to kill this Christ child so Herod put it all together and he says okay two years old can't be over two because of what the wise men said in the scriptures they brought and it's got to be come from over here in Bethlehem let's start this mission to destroy this King because I am the king how much did Herod believe he believed it with everything that was in him but there was no room in herod's heart to allow God to tell his story through him how many times do I hear people say I believe it James the Apostle the pastor of the chur Church of Jerusalem I believe believe it was him that said you're good to believe but the Devils believe and tremble and here we have a story Brother David about a Devil Himself Herod believing in these prophecies and yet used it to destroy this Christ child what a thought and I think of today and all the signs I think what why can't we believe if Herod if he was inspired by a devil how come God's children don't believe even more than Herod believed we don't see we see the signs all around us but we just kind of walk through this life like it doesn't matter there was 20 th000 years from the creation of Adam and Eve to when God made a covenant with man through Abraham then there was another 2,000 years when God made that Covenant to when God sent a deliverer named Jesus Christ to the people and he promised that he would return 2,000 years from the Garden of Eden to God made a covenant with Abraham and promised that he would send a deliverer 2,000 years later that deliverer comes in the name of Jesus Christ a man sacrifice and then now it's been 2,000 years later and he promised to come in this day and yet we just walk through this world like nothing's going on we see that Jesus said before I will return that there would be sin would cover the Earth as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be when I return He said violence was spread across the world World in Noah's day let me ask you this when has this world ever seen in the 6,000 years of History do that we have when has this world ever seen such violence as today and I'm not just talking about rioting in the streets I'm talking about a nuclear bomb that has and could kill millions of people couple seconds in Japan hundreds of thousands of people died talk about violence when is that ever been but it's today we have those we have that way and then he also said as it was in the days of lot who is this man lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so will it be when I return another sign we see today look at today what was lot lot was the governor of the city and then these perverted men perverted sexual Spirit on these men they come and they want to come and use these young men that came to lot and he was afraid of their influence and how our government is afraid today of this influence that we see from the homosexual Lobby and the power that they have they're afraid to say anything just like loton he said before Jesus returned it's going to be that way and where are we if Herod was here he'd be like he's on his way but Herod would be against him but instead God's Children Here we are and we go on eating and drinking doing our thing like nothing's happening with all of these signs set before us I think Brother David I think of Herod he saw it yet Anointed with the devil yet he saw that this was the truth because of the word of God I know I don't think that we understand how important of a time that we live in because we live in this time those Shepherds they probably had no idea but they were living in the the greatest time and they were told by angels and friends we are told we have it a lot easier than the Shepherds had it we're told all the time we have a Bible that we can read this Bible says I just quoted Luke chapter 17 shows us right here we're here and the Shepherds God came to them why because they had a heart that had space in it for something to happen for God to tell his story and he did tell his story through them Herod when it came to him he didn't have room in his heart as the song says there was nothing in Herod Herod wanted he wanted his life he wanted his power he wanted to be important Herod that was everything to him and look at our world today and look at the desires of the hearts of this whole the whole world and we see it all the time on the internet on Tik Tok on on YouTube everywhere else people lifting themselves up think telling everybody how great they are building shrines to themselves like Herod did as he was building all of these these great structures in Jerusalem and we see the same thing today and not caring What God Says and just because someone says that they believe does not matter that's all over the word of God we have have to make room in our hearts and we have to do what the word says look at how Jesus how he was born in this little manger and we all think oh it's so nice by the way I think that I don't know of any other church that actually had a real baby in their play did you see that I wasn't a doll that was that was a real thing here but how many how many people people they know that story and the churches tell the story and yet they won't make a place in their hearts they won't get out the sin and let it be replaced with the true word and the true spirit of God there's a parable in the Bible that is so important for today that there was a a man that had a house and he had this house was was taken by a demon there was a squatter in his house and it was just it was filthy he gets in he KS he K kicks the demon out he cleans his house all up gets it all really nice and puts maybe new furniture in there and new appliances gets it nice nice and clean you come in it smells so good and it's open and Jesus says that if it doesn't get occupied again that that same spirit that was there before was will come by and say hey I know how to get in this place I've been there before and he'll come in and he'll bring all of his friends and they will occupy that house again this time much worse than it was the first time because once that it was cleaned out once we've made room in our heart it needs to be filled back up with something because if it's not there'll be a void there and if that void is there something is going to come back in now think about this man the Rich Young Ruler how Jesus he came to Jesus this wasn't a parable this really happened how this this young man had everything he was a church member he paid his ties he was probably had a prominent role in society he had everything he had a lot of money everything was going good he comes to Jesus and he falls down on his knees and say says Lord how can I inherit the kingdom of God Jesus says we'll do the Commandments he says I'm doing that done it since I was born Jesus looked at him and the Bible says Jesus loved him and he says you lack one thing this man's heart this Rich Young ruler's heart was not open it was closed it was full there was no room for Jesus to come in there Jesus says sell all that you have and come follow me what a what a what words there words of compassion Jesus loved him and he saw that this is going to send this man to hell if he doesn't get rid of it get rid of these things make room in your heart for God to tell his story that man I look at that story of that man that Rich Young Ruler what was stopping him for being one of the 12 disciples we would have known his name he would have had a great ministry but there was no room in this Rich Young ruler's heart as good as he was as good as he seemed there wasn't any room and he left and we know what end where he ended up think about friends these what in our lives what in our lives will prevent God from telling his story through me through you now I I have to say all of us have taken up everybody in this room our hearts are not perfect there's things that that we have in our lives that we need to get rid of I've made a stand over the past year it's been very important to me to reach out to people and say come as you are I don't care what kind of a life that you've lived I don't care if you're on drugs I don't care how you look I don't care how you dress I don't care whatever it is about you come to this place come as you are but don't stay as you are make room in your heart when you come here here and this church is accepts you which it does and you feel that love from the people and you come in and and and you give your heart to the Lord we've baptized more than 50 people up here in just this short amount of time there was a sister I preached that message a few weeks ago on we all have our vices we all have our weaknesses and those weaknesses we need to get rid of those weaknesses I was I was up there baptizing a sister tears in her eyes and I said sister I said why do you want to be baptized she said because I have many vices that is a heart that can be made room in that heart for God to tell the story through that person that Jesus Christ that baby in the manger was planted in that heart and for someone to say something like that I know God's going to tell his story in that sister no doubt in my mind but it's that other heart that cold Stony heart that won't allow God won't allow God in because I've got too much as a Rich Young Ruler the song says as I said come the song that we just sang that the kids just sang says come as you are what a beautiful thing come as you are but I say in the name of Jesus Christ don't stay as you are change let that let that heart be filled with Jesus Christ we always talk about Christmas and we think of a baby in a Manger get the baby out of the manger bring that baby Let It Grow The Book of Luke talks about Jesus and about when he was young and it says he grew in stature and in favor of the Lord Jesus Christ himself grew in stature and in favor of the Lord so if we have him in our hearts and he's in there he could be just a baby in a Manger just a little tiny B it allow him to grow allow Jesus to mature in your heart and how do you do that make room in your heart get rid of these these things that that set you back and allow Jesus to replace those things allow him to grow and mature and we look at Jesus and when he started his ministry he started doing doing Miracles the first message that Jesus preached the very first one he said repent imagine there's people it is hard for them to admit their wrong and you we they go along through life they get corrected or whatever it might be and there is no repentance there let him grow that was just the very beginning of his ministry and then as he as he went on he grew even after after he started preaching he grew in the in the spirit we look at his very first he was baptized the Holy Spirit came down on him he went into the Wilderness fasted for 40 days was tempted of the devil and overcame he was growing and if he's in our hearts if he's in us we need to grow but instead we don't allow him we say Lord you can be a baby in a Manger in my heart but when it comes to me making changes in my life that's my life this is me I need to make myself happy before I can before I can do something for other I need I need to serve myself before I can serve others I need to love myself before I can love others that is a worldly worldly statement that is not a Christian statement but how much do we we hear that all the time you got to love yourself first You Don't Have To Love Yourself I hate myself I don't want anything to do with Daniel Evans I want it to be Jesus Christ and him living in me let it grow let that Christ mature all the way till Jesus came to the end and he said now take up your cross and follow me you do what I did you you sacrifice everything just like I did and there is that Spirit of Christ where we get down on our knees and say Lord forgive me I've done wrong I'm going to stop doing this as we talked about a vice a problem a sin I'm going to get rid of this and I'm going to get rid of it just so your spirit can come in just a little bit more in my heart I just want more I want more more the Bible says let me just mention a couple things there's many people friends that they're too good maybe to go to church well we just we stay home and and uh we just listen to a tape and uh we're better than everybody else because of this let us hold fast to the profession of our faith Hebrews chapter 10:23 let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering for he that is he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another why is it saying that let us consider one another to provoke un love to encourage to love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is Herod would read that Bible read that verse and he'd be like well that's that let's find some way to mess it up not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching encourage one another and I've said this before you think going to church is for you well I don't need it when did this whole thing become about you if you want to come to church it says serve others help others encourage others that's why we're here so if I'm not going and I'm not fellowshipping I'm not in church it's all about me and I don't care about you care about other people friends what a bad attitude but that's the attitude it's all about me and going to church we should serve others there's many things friends we have to think about Jesus First Timothy Chapter 2 it says that a woman shall Adorn herself in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with gold or pearls or costly array another thing Lord how is my dress how do the way that I look how is this serving you I want to be holy Lord I I sacrifice whatever it is I want to be like you want me to be Lord not a aundy old tradition maybe but Lord now Holiness before the Lord how can I be what you want me to be modest with shamefacedness and sobriety humbleness not with gold or pearls or C I've seen ministers I've seen pastors and their wives have handbags that are $1,500 $2,000 what for a pastor of a church come on no better than that don't forget it's not just about the modest apparel it's also about the shamefacedness and soing not with gold or pearls or costly rates also about that Jesus said that if a man looks at a woman to lust after her he has committed adultery in his heart let's make room in our hearts here I'm not talking about looking at the sisters in church necessarily I'm not talking about maybe looking at the the women out in the world or on the street what about those women right here what about seeing that make room in your heart get rid of that too Jesus said Peter asked he he was offended at somebody he said if somebody sins against me how many times do I have to offend him Jesus looks down at him he's like Peter if he offends you seven times a day you gota you you have to forgive him and then we hold a grudge we hold a grudge against someone that we can't forgive or someone that we don't like that spot in your heart is taken up and Jesus wants you to clean that spot out how can we even call ourselves Christians and make those sins I know we sin I know I know I'm not saying that you'll be without sin but I'm saying try I'm saying make room in your heart for Jesus to tell his story through your life life all of us or else this whole story of the birth of Jesus what good is it if we just leave Jesus right there in the manger if we' have left him there he wouldn't have preached he wouldn't have went to the Cross he would have been a baby forever but he grew and he should be growing in our hearts friends all all close and if if uh our team can come forward and sister Jessica if you would also um come turn to Philippians chapter 2 verse five tell you brothers and sisters I love I love the Lord Jesus I love his birth and the Shepherds and the wise men and this story it's been said that this is The Greatest Story Ever Told it is The Greatest Story Ever Told but I wanted to be a dive Within Me Philippians 2:5 says this let the mind be in you which also was also in Christ Jesus let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus the mind of this man Jesus Christ should be in us who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself let the mind that was in him be in us he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross cross as I said Jesus grew in spirit and in stature he told us to take up our cross take up the same life that he had lived and let God tell his story through us don't let this Christmas pass brothers and sisters don't let this Christmas pass without making changes in your life life this is a serious time the Clock Was ticking when Daniel when he wrote his scriptures these wise men they watched these scriptures come down through and can you imagine what they thought when they looked out and they said brothers and sisters it's time it's time for for Jesus to return is what we would say we see the sign of Sodom we see the sign of Noah we see the sign of the times we see all of the all of this add up and all these Generations that came down and here are these wise men and they see that star of God and it was a sign to them but that sign did not mean to stop it didn't mean to just jump up and down that God sent us a sign do what the sign says they got on their camels or they got their staffs and they started walking they brought their their gifts and They carried it hundreds of miles that probably took him as I said over a year to get there their mind was on Christ their mind was on God they wanted the honor of bowing down before this baby a baby what's a baby going to do for you they wanted the honor of just bowing down to this baby and saying this is the Christ child this is the king of Israel this was the one that was sent to save man from his sins look down they gave their gifts they gave what they had and how we brothers and sisters we should make room in our hearts for Jesus Christ everyone here listen I don't accept brothers and sisters I don't accept the way you are I don't not one of you I love you I love you for who you are but I do not accept the way any of us are we need to change we need to step it up in our lives we need to make room in our hearts for Jesus Christ every one of us has weaknesses every one of us has places that are taking up with things that shouldn't be there will this Christmas Mark a change will it or is this just some preacher up here telling a story I want him to tell his story through me I want to I want to be God's story I was a sinner I'm different now and I'm trying to make room in my heart for Jesus Christ even the more I want to be so full of
