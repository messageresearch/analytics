[30:35] this is
[30:42] [Music]
[30:48] God bless you all
[30:51] yeah
[30:51] um it's been about close to a year ago
[30:54] that I finished
[30:56] um a Bible that I read from Genesis all
[30:59] the way to Revelation and I humbly say
[31:02] that that was probably about the 10th
[31:04] time reading the Bible from beginning to
[31:07] end and
[31:09] um after I finished Bible I started
[31:11] another one because I highlight the
[31:13] whole Bible to Market and and whatever
[31:17] and so I said well I'm gonna have to see
[31:20] if I can find me any other Bible usually
[31:22] I pick him up as a thrift store
[31:24] and um
[31:26] anyway so a few days later after I
[31:29] finished the Bible
[31:31] um
[31:32] I was uh in front of the building
[31:34] waiting for my nephew and I was going to
[31:37] take him somewhere and um
[31:40] this man that I know came to choose a
[31:43] car and he said I have a book for you
[31:46] and he says I know how you'd like to
[31:49] read the Bible and pray and I have this
[31:51] book for you and so he gave me this bag
[31:54] I took out the
[31:55] I took out the book and it turned out to
[31:58] be this uh King James version of a Bible
[32:01] and with big letters so I was so blessed
[32:05] with that oh I've just kept praising the
[32:07] Lord all the way to where me and my
[32:09] nephew my daughter were going to go I
[32:11] was just so happy and I showed it to my
[32:14] nephew and shared with him how happy I
[32:16] was about that Bible
[32:18] well having said that
[32:21] um
[32:22] luckily I'm able when I work I've been
[32:25] working all week and whenever I work I'm
[32:28] able to take my Bible and read it I pray
[32:31] at home for half an hour or so and then
[32:33] I pack up my Bible with my food and take
[32:36] it to work and
[32:38] um and the co-worker he knows not to
[32:41] interrupt me when I'm reading and if he
[32:43] does I just look at him and and then he
[32:46] shuts up anyway so uh luckily I've been
[32:49] able to nobody says anything I'm able to
[32:52] take my Bible to work and as soon as I
[32:54] get a little something done I pull up my
[32:56] Bible and read the chapter for the day
[32:58] uh and uh anyway so
[33:02] but on Thursday of last week
[33:05] um
[33:06] I was called to see if I could help out
[33:08] in the in at the food program they were
[33:11] handing out food and I was called and it
[33:14] was be I was supposed to be there
[33:16] between nine and ten so I stayed there
[33:18] and I finished what I had to do and then
[33:22] I had to go up and
[33:23] grab something to eat in my Bible and
[33:26] and I hadn't read my Bible that morning
[33:28] and so I went and grabbed my Bible and a
[33:31] book I was reading of the Holocaust and
[33:34] then I had to go work in the council
[33:36] office
[33:37] um because they made me vice president
[33:39] anyway so um I went to go work and um
[33:43] and I took a couple of jokes water but I
[33:46] mean jokes that I had to fill up so I I
[33:50] get there and the president of the
[33:52] council was there so um so I wasn't able
[33:55] to use my desk and and when she was busy
[33:59] doing paperwork with a social worker so
[34:02] I went I took my Bible and the book I
[34:05] was reading out and I placed them on a
[34:07] little shelf uh that was you know that
[34:10] was there and I took the and I excused
[34:14] myself and went to go get my jokes a
[34:15] while or came back and um
[34:18] and I didn't know where else to go so I
[34:20] went to a back room
[34:22] and I grabbed my book of of the
[34:24] Holocaust I'm going to finish reading it
[34:26] I read that and then uh it was probably
[34:30] close to New and I was getting hungry so
[34:32] I excused myself again
[34:35] and I had begun something at my
[34:37] apartment so I left to go to my
[34:39] apartment to pick up what I was going to
[34:41] get and when I came back nobody was in
[34:44] the office it was left open it was empty
[34:46] and nobody was there so I went back to
[34:49] my little spot in the back and I
[34:52] prepared my meal
[34:54] and oh and then I excused myself again
[34:57] while I went down to pick up some ice
[34:59] cream from where they had Danielle ice
[35:02] cream I came back and I ate my meal and
[35:06] I was throwing away a plastic bag and
[35:08] the trash can back there I'm hardly ever
[35:10] there I you know
[35:13] um
[35:14] anyway and so I went to go throw this
[35:16] plastic bag away and I see the covering
[35:19] put my Bible in there and the first
[35:22] thing that I think is why did they throw
[35:25] my Bible away I look in there and I got
[35:28] the cardboard out and it had been torn
[35:30] off of my Bible
[35:31] and but by my Bible wasn't there
[35:35] and and so I went into the office by
[35:37] then there was a few people coming and
[35:39] going of the council and I said does
[35:43] anybody know what happened to my Bible
[35:45] and some of them they said no whatever
[35:48] anyway to make sure this one woman said
[35:51] your Bible's missing I go yeah somebody
[35:54] took the cover up and threw in the trash
[35:56] but my my Bible is gone and I was really
[36:00] close to tears you know and um
[36:03] anyway and so then um this woman one
[36:07] woman that worked in the council well as
[36:09] council member she says well we could
[36:11] buy you another Bible and um I mean I
[36:15] wouldn't I wouldn't have taken your
[36:16] Bible she said I just got I just barely
[36:18] started going to church and this lady
[36:21] that I'm going to church with gave me a
[36:23] brand new Bible and so I you know I
[36:27] wouldn't take your Bible everybody was
[36:28] saying they didn't take it
[36:30] anyway
[36:32] um I everybody laughed funny and about
[36:35] they left about three o'clock the
[36:38] president of the council and so I had to
[36:40] work until four but
[36:43] um
[36:43] anyway I finished reading my book on the
[36:46] Holocaust and I just sat there and wait
[36:48] you know did my duties and I went home
[36:51] as soon as I went home I just burst out
[36:53] crying I was so sad
[36:55] but I'd be you always tell tears of joy
[36:58] but anyway
[37:00] um that went on that was Thursday when
[37:02] on Thursday Friday I think on Friday
[37:06] I um
[37:07] I had talked to um uh
[37:11] a security guard and asked him if he
[37:13] would look at the footage on the cameras
[37:15] because we have cameras outside the
[37:17] office anyway he did and he they run
[37:20] they asked him and he said no I didn't
[37:21] show anything I mean I could really tell
[37:23] people coming and going to the office
[37:25] then
[37:27] on um I think it was on Saturday I'm not
[37:31] too sure what day maybe but oh yes it
[37:33] was Friday night I talked to another
[37:35] security guard and he let me go in the
[37:38] office and look at the footage and there
[37:41] was one person that I could see like
[37:43] getting something from the shelf and
[37:45] putting it in a bag
[37:47] and then she walked out with her bags
[37:50] and then um before I told the the
[37:53] security guard I think he says you know
[37:55] it seems like there's that woman with
[37:57] the yellow blouse and I had come to the
[37:59] same conclusion
[38:00] and so I let it go and
[38:03] and I was praying Lord forgive me if I'm
[38:07] feeling uh selfish but maybe that woman
[38:09] needed it more than me
[38:11] um if that's the issue then you know
[38:15] whatever your will is but then again
[38:17] with Christ says Lord I want that Bible
[38:19] it means a lot to me
[38:20] anyway and then so anyway
[38:24] um that went on for days and Sunday I
[38:27] was just crying and crying and so I got
[38:29] another Bible I was reading another
[38:30] Bible and I thanked the Lord that at
[38:32] least I was able to read that Bible and
[38:35] take it to work with me Saturday and
[38:37] Sunday I took it to work with me on
[38:39] Monday I'm trying to make this as quick
[38:41] as possible
[38:42] and monkey that woman that I suspected
[38:45] um
[38:46] that had uh had taken my Bible she came
[38:49] down and to the back dog where I was
[38:51] working and she said have you found the
[38:53] Bible
[38:54] and has it showed up and and I got up
[38:57] and I said well you know I took it down
[38:59] the hall and I took her you know what
[39:01] it's being brought to my attention that
[39:03] you took it you know and um
[39:07] and I thought maybe you need it more
[39:09] than me or whatever and she said no you
[39:11] remember I told you I had a brand new
[39:13] Bible I would never take it and I go
[39:16] well I mentioned it to management that
[39:19] my Bible was stolen I've taken and I
[39:22] also mentioned it to the president of
[39:24] the council that my Bible was taken and
[39:27] um I I saw it in the in the book footage
[39:31] from the cameras
[39:33] and I said some and it shows that you
[39:37] took it
[39:38] and she goes well and I said maybe you
[39:40] took it by mistake whatever reason you
[39:42] might take it have taken it from my
[39:44] mistake but
[39:46] uh and I have another Bible but I I
[39:50] really love I really would like that

[40:09] in the morning came out he says oh I

[40:14] who told you about it he said and he

[46:40] another and I know tonight is graduation
[46:42] night from schools for the Lyle sister
[46:45] Heather we're going to be
[46:47] with one of their granddaughters
[46:49] grandchildren not sure but
[46:51] many places so it'll be the start of a
[46:54] different part of life
[46:56] especially for the high school and the
[46:58] college grads
[46:59] and God bless them the Christian ones
[47:02] and and those all that would turn their
[47:03] face to him and say Lord Direct Me Guide
[47:06] Me
[47:07] a lot of decisions to make way to go how
[47:10] to continue what's next in life
[47:14] but if we get committed to the Lord he
[47:16] said he would never leave us and never
[47:18] forsake us so
[47:20] I appreciate that and God bless each one
[47:22] of you coming out tonight
[47:25] lord said where two or three are
[47:27] gathered in his name he'd be in our
[47:29] midst and that's what makes it worth it
[47:32] also
[47:33] brother Daniel had mentioned to me if I
[47:36] would take the service tonight
[47:38] and I said it will I began promise I
[47:41] will preach or what because sometimes I
[47:42] get out quite late
[47:44] and he said well I'll give you I'll set
[47:46] up a tape to be ready if that if that's
[47:49] what you can't make it will do and
[47:51] so I listen to that tape and I listened
[47:54] to there's three different tapes of
[47:55] brother
[47:56] Daniel and he was I heard this one you
[47:59] ought to hear this one and
[48:00] I don't know there's one that's not a
[48:02] good tape to listen to
[48:04] they're all but sometimes just something
[48:05] just strikes your heart something
[48:08] that are in the show
[48:10] I just finished listening to Restoration
[48:12] of the Bride tree
[48:14] and then there's the acts of the Holy
[48:16] Spirit and
[48:18] and it's just realizing the work that
[48:22] God has done
[48:23] but it's not just a work in the sense I
[48:26] did this work now admire but a work that
[48:28] he did so that you could participate and
[48:30] be part of it
[48:32] and it's his desires so
[48:35] we'll take it this portion out of the
[48:38] book of Romans
[48:40] and I would call it it's it's the acts
[48:42] of the holy spirit in US
[48:44] it's not wasn't the the acts of the
[48:47] disciples or the apostles but the Holy
[48:50] Spirit acting through them and them
[48:52] giving of themselves and yielding
[48:54] brother Branham says in in brother
[48:56] Jordan there's just one to go over three
[48:59] short quotes here and some things that
[49:01] brother Branham said about this
[49:04] and um
[49:06] the first one in
[49:09] my angel shall go before thee he says
[49:12] Thou was not Moses that was sent Moses
[49:15] was just the instrument
[49:17] and you and I are the instrument that
[49:19] God God uses today now in my heart I I
[49:22] believe that God has always been the
[49:24] same All Through the Ages in every age
[49:26] he's been just as it was at the
[49:28] beginning he was manifested in the
[49:31] fatherhood he was manifested in the
[49:33] sonship he would he's manifested now in
[49:36] the dispensation of the Holy Spirit
[49:39] we're not living we're living not in the
[49:42] Christian dispensation but in the Holy
[49:44] Spirit dispensation
[49:45] the acts of the holy spirit in the
[49:47] church the church reaction to what the
[49:50] holy spirit is in them as I read that
[49:54] last line is what you're manifesting
[49:56] shows what spirit's in you
[49:58] and he said it's the reaction of of the
[50:00] holy spirit in them
[50:02] and then from Witnesses
[50:05] the next quote there
[50:08] he says and now I want to read some in
[50:10] the New Testament in the first chapter
[50:12] of the acts of the Apostle the apostles
[50:15] I think this should be called the acts
[50:17] of the holy spirit in the apostles
[50:20] it was the way the Holy Spirit made the
[50:23] apostles act after he came
[50:26] and in in 63 in the token
[50:30] he said but Believers take the token and
[50:34] what Jesus began to do in Galilee he
[50:36] continues to do now
[50:38] through his display of the token of the
[50:40] Holy Spirit back upon the church
[50:43] for it was not the acts of the Apostle
[50:45] it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[50:47] apostles and that was the token
[50:51] and sometimes it's we might look at well
[50:54] that's a godly man that's a Godly sister
[50:56] that's a Godly brother and boy he's full
[50:59] of the Holy Ghost
[51:01] well that's it he's full of the Holy
[51:02] Ghost she's full of the Holy Ghost
[51:04] I was I was talking um with my wife and
[51:07] and you know we
[51:10] as Christians and as humans we we want
[51:12] to be good we want to do good
[51:15] um
[51:16] you know I don't think sister Emilio
[51:18] wanted to get angry at that lady but she
[51:20] wanted her Bible
[51:21] you know
[51:23] it's but our good deeds will not save us
[51:28] but I would ever say stop doing the good
[51:30] deeds because it won't save you in fact
[51:32] Christ in you should be allowing you to
[51:35] do those things you know
[51:37] and I was telling you there's just some
[51:39] wonderful people out there some great
[51:41] people well known in the world well
[51:43] known through history talk about Abraham
[51:45] Lincoln we talk about the different ones
[51:47] they talk about Mother Teresa and the
[51:50] wonderful people doing great Deeds doing
[51:54] good things
[51:56] and that is wonderful but that will not
[51:59] save you
[52:01] it's what God did for you that brings
[52:05] salvation now what you do back
[52:08] is because you love him and you say Lord
[52:11] I would do this and I want others to
[52:13] know this
[52:15] and we said that is the token
[52:18] the Holy Spirit In You
[52:21] and without it there is no way
[52:25] to go on there is no token to continue
[52:28] on as he would say oh you're going to
[52:31] get on the train brother Ramson there's
[52:33] that token you're gonna you show that
[52:34] that the price has been paid already
[52:37] and as as
[52:39] I was looking at this and from the
[52:41] restoration of the Bride tree as I was
[52:44] listening to that and
[52:46] I realized
[52:48] it was Christ taking back that which had
[52:51] been lost or had been set back in the
[52:54] beginning and restoring it
[52:57] and I was sharing some things with my
[52:59] wife she usually gets to hear it first
[53:02] and I tell her you know does it make
[53:05] sense is it coming you know I know what
[53:07] I'm thinking but sometimes the words
[53:09] don't come out that way
[53:11] and I said the restoration of the Bride
[53:13] tree
[53:14] and it just made me think you can't get
[53:16] in an argument with the Devil
[53:20] because he will say I was there when it
[53:23] happened in fact I caused the trouble in
[53:26] the first place
[53:27] I was there he said before I was cast
[53:30] down I could tell you what it's like you
[53:32] can't get into an argument with him
[53:34] you have to take God at his word
[53:38] sometimes I my imagination will go this
[53:41] way my thoughts will go that way but you
[53:43] got to check it does it stay true to the
[53:45] word of God and and
[53:47] how many times brother Branham brought
[53:50] this to our attention even Jesus when
[53:52] Satan came to Temple and he said it is
[53:54] written it is written it is written he
[53:57] didn't go be beyond anything so if we
[54:00] can go back to the word of God we can
[54:01] see what God has to us and then we have
[54:03] to say it be it unto me according to Thy
[54:05] word Lord
[54:07] and then so in the restoration of the
[54:10] Bride tree it's a he is bringing back
[54:13] that which was lost but it was lost for
[54:16] a purpose for a reason
[54:19] and and as I thought about that you you
[54:22] start looking through history as you
[54:24] know there's a job and then there's Noah
[54:26] and we come to Abraham and thinking
[54:29] about Abraham and Sarah
[54:31] and I said here's Abraham and Sarah
[54:33] let's tell my wife they they became
[54:35] older folks as time went on they had not
[54:38] had children they wanted children and
[54:40] they got beyond that that age to Bear
[54:42] children
[54:44] but God said through thy seed
[54:48] and that was what God's word said
[54:50] through you Abraham and Sarah and we
[54:53] know when he gives them that promise
[54:54] sitting there in the tent that Sarah
[54:56] laughs in her heart saying how can this
[54:58] be I'm beyond that how can all of this
[55:00] be
[55:01] but God had said so
[55:04] and he restores them back to a young
[55:06] couple
[55:09] and and that's that's a view of what God
[55:12] is going to do with us restore us back
[55:13] to but
[55:15] Abraham and Sarah got old again and
[55:18] Abraham and Sarah passed away
[55:21] so that was just a type but today there
[55:24] is a group of people who are not going
[55:26] to see death
[55:28] but they're going to be changed from
[55:29] this Mortal to immortality
[55:32] and I count myself as one of those
[55:34] and Lord I I've confessed your word I've
[55:37] accepted you I've been baptized in the
[55:40] name of Lord Jesus Christ you've given
[55:42] me the Holy Ghost I believe I'm one of
[55:43] them and I'll stand on that
[55:46] and brother Branham says on just some
[55:48] things as I was listening it's a good
[55:50] thing to be a Christian
[55:53] I like that statement it's a good thing
[55:55] to be a Christian
[55:56] because there is no hope on the outside
[56:00] and he says
[56:01] and then he says when God speaks it's
[56:03] perfect
[56:05] it doesn't have to be retracted
[56:07] Rewritten hey can you check this to no
[56:10] when God speaks it's perfect it's
[56:12] complete it's whole it's as it should be
[56:16] and then as he's talking through through
[56:19] and this was through the three different
[56:20] messages just some notes out of that
[56:23] it's God's in spirit form in you
[56:28] Christ in you the hope of glory
[56:32] I I shared this before with you and it
[56:36] reminded me
[56:38] brother Ram says they would say you
[56:41] don't know him well your theology is not
[56:43] that good you know how to put all the
[56:45] words together he goes I may not know
[56:47] the book very well
[56:49] but I'm very good friends with the
[56:51] author
[56:52] the one that wrote the book
[56:55] and that's where the difference is and
[56:57] and to me we were driving into church
[56:59] one day and we were talking about it
[57:01] this and I said it would be like if you
[57:03] wrote a book
[57:05] and I'm reading it and I read through a
[57:07] verse there or or a paragraph and I turn
[57:11] around and goes I think you meant this
[57:12] and this what you wrote that
[57:15] and then she would say no when I wrote
[57:16] that I was thinking this and this and
[57:19] this because she's the author of the
[57:20] book
[57:21] well if we go and talk to him and say
[57:23] Lord I'm reading your scripture what
[57:26] does it mean
[57:27] I'm not understanding this part it's and
[57:30] then he begins to share it with you and
[57:33] then it's real then it becomes so
[57:36] is it so it's God in that Spirit form in
[57:39] you he says you didn't join this body
[57:41] you were born into it
[57:44] it's God in spirit form and you're born
[57:47] you're Christian you're part of the
[57:49] family of God
[57:50] you know so God predestinated
[57:55] you
[57:56] and sometimes that word predestined or
[57:59] or uh you know foreknowledge of God
[58:02] depends which word you some people they
[58:05] foreknowledge I understand
[58:05] predestination is based on the
[58:07] foreknowledge of God he knows what's
[58:09] going to happen it's kind of like a
[58:11] mother or father that has a child that
[58:13] is sticking their hand in the fire you
[58:15] pretty well got an idea what's going to
[58:17] happen don't you
[58:18] because you probably did it yourself too
[58:20] you're going to burn yourself you know
[58:22] it's it's I know it so I I I stop them
[58:26] don't do that that's going to hurt
[58:28] how do you know Dad because I've done it
[58:31] before and it hurts you know so he said
[58:34] you are predestinated and then he ties
[58:37] it in all that the father has given me
[58:40] will come and not one will be lost
[58:44] not a single one
[58:46] that faith on the cross you and I had we
[58:50] been standing there watching the
[58:51] crucifixion would have said if we'd
[58:54] known Jesus he doesn't deserve it but
[58:55] those two do
[58:57] they're up on the cross before their
[58:59] crimes but he did no crime
[59:02] but I I just said this I I to my thought
[59:05] was Lord Jesus he said it's time to get
[59:08] on that cross now because there's going
[59:10] to be a thief next to me that I'm going
[59:11] to turn around and speak to and say this
[59:13] day you'll be with me in Paradise
[59:16] had it happened the day before but God's
[59:18] timing is perfect
[59:21] without fault
[59:23] he says
[59:25] and not one will be lost
[59:27] saved by grace and not by works
[59:31] not your ability to live a Christian
[59:34] Life
[59:36] but you do it because you love him
[59:39] never because Lord this is good enough
[59:42] therefore you have to save me
[59:45] and this is where Paul gets into that in
[59:47] in Romans chapter 8.
[59:50] and um I I was thinking of a good friend
[59:53] of mine
[59:54] a good brother
[59:57] and but when he lived in the world he he
[1:00:00] got tattoos on his arms and stuff like
[1:00:02] that and when he became a Christian he
[1:00:04] was so embarrassed of them
[1:00:06] so he always wore long sleeve
[1:00:10] so that nobody would see it he'd always
[1:00:12] said I'm just embarrassed of it I wish
[1:00:14] I'd never done it
[1:00:15] and it just made me I was remembering
[1:00:18] that it made me think
[1:00:20] I I understand you can go now and have
[1:00:23] them removed it's a painful project I'm
[1:00:26] sure
[1:00:28] but when this portal
[1:00:30] shall put on immortality
[1:00:33] all the evidence of that life will be
[1:00:35] gone and done with
[1:00:37] what a hope we have brother Branham says
[1:00:40] when the angel of the Lord asked him he
[1:00:41] says would you like to get a come over
[1:00:44] onto the other side and brother Brown
[1:00:46] said oh it would help me so much
[1:00:49] wouldn't it be wonderful just to be able
[1:00:51] to step in there and just see it just
[1:00:53] for a few moments to know
[1:00:56] it's worth it all
[1:00:58] you know and he said they were young
[1:01:00] they were beautiful they were clean they
[1:01:03] were holy there was no evidence of of
[1:01:05] this world there
[1:01:08] on the other side but in the meantime
[1:01:10] you have to battle with it you have to
[1:01:13] and and this where I believe Paul is
[1:01:15] talking there in in Romans
[1:01:19] Romans chapter 8 there that we're going
[1:01:22] to get into a little bit
[1:01:25] you know and and so let's look at let's
[1:01:27] start with verse 1 chapter 8 and and
[1:01:30] we're not going to read the whole
[1:01:31] chapter straight through we're going to
[1:01:32] go through most of it but to save a
[1:01:35] little bit of time and try not to be too
[1:01:37] long
[1:01:39] you know
[1:01:40] brother Branham tells you see yourself
[1:01:42] in the scriptures
[1:01:44] see yourself in the scriptures
[1:01:47] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:01:49] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:01:53] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:01:55] spirit
[1:01:57] there is no condemnation you are not
[1:02:01] guilty
[1:02:04] when you are condemned you're found
[1:02:06] guilty but he says there's no
[1:02:08] condemnation now you'll stop and you
[1:02:10] start looking at your own life sometimes
[1:02:12] well I've done this I've done that
[1:02:15] but his blood covers it all
[1:02:18] you know
[1:02:20] when you go and you make it right and
[1:02:22] you put it under the blood you confess
[1:02:24] your sin whatever it is you make it
[1:02:25] right and it's it's done away with
[1:02:29] except it stays here in you in your
[1:02:32] memory
[1:02:33] yeah but you go to God and you tell them
[1:02:35] I've done it again and he looks at the
[1:02:38] book he says no this is the first time
[1:02:39] you've done it there's no evidence that
[1:02:41] you've ever done it before if you've
[1:02:42] made it right
[1:02:45] but you struggle with it here
[1:02:48] and and so but Paul says there is
[1:02:51] therefore now no condemnation
[1:02:56] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:02:58] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:03:00] spirit remember you are a child of God
[1:03:03] you are in Christ Jesus you're part you
[1:03:06] know Mary had to say be it unto me
[1:03:09] according to Thy Word
[1:03:13] when the angel came to her and said
[1:03:15] you're going to have a child without
[1:03:17] knowing a man
[1:03:19] and she said be it unto me according to
[1:03:21] Thy Word
[1:03:22] you have to say the same thing be it
[1:03:25] unto me according to Thy word there is
[1:03:27] therefore no condemnation
[1:03:30] you're not found guilty he took the
[1:03:32] guilt for you
[1:03:33] for the law of the spirit of Life In
[1:03:35] Christ
[1:03:37] Jesus has made me free from the law of
[1:03:41] sin and death
[1:03:43] not bound not tied to it there are going
[1:03:45] to be a people who are going to be
[1:03:47] raptured are going to have a change
[1:03:49] without death and they're going over to
[1:03:51] the other side
[1:03:52] there is some because the scripture says
[1:03:56] so and I believe I'm going to be one of
[1:03:58] those
[1:03:59] and so the law of the spirit that is the
[1:04:02] gospel has freed me from the law of sin
[1:04:06] and death which was a mosaic
[1:04:08] dispensation for Moses
[1:04:10] Moses gave them the law you shall do
[1:04:12] this and you shall not do this if you do
[1:04:16] this this is the the results of that
[1:04:19] and who could keep the law
[1:04:22] no one was able to keep the law perfect
[1:04:25] they would stand outside the
[1:04:27] congregation with us then when the when
[1:04:29] the high priest went in
[1:04:31] once a year to offer that sacrifice and
[1:04:35] it would stay out to watch the smoke to
[1:04:37] see if it had been accepted by the Lord
[1:04:40] and they knew their sins were forgiven
[1:04:43] rolled back for another year
[1:04:45] but then they went back out and began to
[1:04:47] do the same things they had done before
[1:04:49] there was not a change
[1:04:52] but in today when you accept that
[1:04:55] perfect sacrifice and it is accepted for
[1:04:58] you it brings a change into you
[1:05:00] the desire begins to change
[1:05:03] and no longer and sometimes yes this
[1:05:06] flesh
[1:05:07] what you have on you and you battle it
[1:05:09] this flesh is not the redeemable part
[1:05:11] it's that which is inside of you that
[1:05:13] Christ is
[1:05:14] but you came in flesh
[1:05:16] and that's the one you struggle with
[1:05:19] but you have to take the word of God and
[1:05:22] apply there is therefore now no
[1:05:24] condemnation
[1:05:27] for what the law could could not do in
[1:05:30] that it was weak through the flesh
[1:05:33] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:05:36] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[1:05:39] sin in the flesh he put it the end of it
[1:05:44] you know when brother Branham he talks
[1:05:45] about that that time that he he went to
[1:05:48] the that restaurant and that that lady
[1:05:50] was there and all that was going on and
[1:05:52] he got very critical very upset very how
[1:05:56] can how can you stand this God how you
[1:05:58] can and he's the angel that pulls him
[1:06:00] outside and begins to show him what he
[1:06:04] looked like
[1:06:05] before God
[1:06:08] that reminds me what brother green said
[1:06:10] brother Branham told him he said brother
[1:06:12] mcgreen he said
[1:06:13] where you stand everything you do is
[1:06:16] send to me
[1:06:19] and boy that that had been pretty hard
[1:06:22] to take I'm sure
[1:06:24] but he says
[1:06:25] before God where I stand everything I do
[1:06:28] is send to him
[1:06:31] so and the honest truth all of us are
[1:06:33] sinners saved by grace
[1:06:36] how many appreciate the grace of God the
[1:06:38] mercy of God
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:44] so he says for what the law could not do
[1:06:47] that it was weak through the flesh you
[1:06:51] could not serve
[1:06:53] perfect law through the flesh
[1:06:56] David is David a man after God's Own
[1:07:00] Heart
[1:07:01] that was his desire that was Israel as a
[1:07:04] man after God's Own Heart yet he looks
[1:07:06] and he sees a woman that is another
[1:07:09] man's wife and has the man put to death
[1:07:12] so he could take her
[1:07:15] yet he was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:07:20] but you know where it showed when the
[1:07:22] prophet comes
[1:07:24] and he comes up to him and says David
[1:07:25] let me tell you what happened down here
[1:07:27] there was two men one had a large flock
[1:07:29] of sheep and one had one and the one
[1:07:32] that had a large flock of sheep one of
[1:07:34] his friends came over and in order to
[1:07:36] feed him he took and killed the Lamb of
[1:07:38] the one that only had one
[1:07:40] and fed him and David says that man
[1:07:42] should die and the prophet says that's
[1:07:44] you David
[1:07:47] that's you you took another man's wife
[1:07:49] and caused him
[1:07:51] did I
[1:07:52] and David throws himself down and says
[1:07:55] Lord forgive me
[1:07:57] immediately and didn't make excuses
[1:07:59] didn't begin to say well it's because of
[1:08:01] this and it was that fault in this but
[1:08:03] he began to say God have mercy on me
[1:08:05] because he was a man after God's Own
[1:08:08] Heart and what is God's Own Heart
[1:08:10] forgive them they don't know what
[1:08:12] they're doing
[1:08:13] that's God's Own Heart
[1:08:16] Jerusalem Jerusalem how oft what I stood
[1:08:19] over you in the mount look at him he
[1:08:20] said and and coverage you as a hand
[1:08:22] covers it but you would not
[1:08:25] and then they hear you later
[1:08:27] after
[1:08:29] when he appears again to them
[1:08:31] when we're up in heaven and he's they
[1:08:34] ask him where did you get those scars
[1:08:37] in the house of my friends
[1:08:40] he comes back to them because his desire
[1:08:43] was to them
[1:08:46] how he says
[1:08:48] and then we'll jump over to chapter
[1:08:50] verse 9.
[1:08:52] but you're not in the flesh but in the
[1:08:55] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:08:58] dwell in you
[1:09:01] I'm gonna raise my hand and acknowledge
[1:09:03] the spirit of God dwells in me
[1:09:05] amen
[1:09:08] I look at myself sometimes I say oh Lord
[1:09:10] sometimes this Spirit seems to be
[1:09:12] stronger than your spirit but I know
[1:09:14] I know it's you and me he says
[1:09:17] but you are not in the flesh but in the
[1:09:19] spirit if it's so be that the spirit of
[1:09:21] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[1:09:24] the spirit of God Christ is none of his
[1:09:29] so he says if you could be very
[1:09:31] religious you could go to church every
[1:09:33] day you could read your Bible today if
[1:09:35] you could pray but if the spirit of
[1:09:36] Christ I mean he says there is nothing
[1:09:38] there
[1:09:40] I I I've some good friends some
[1:09:42] wonderful people
[1:09:44] sometimes I think they embarrass us
[1:09:47] sometimes they're better than us
[1:09:49] but they'll deny the word of God
[1:09:53] but they're good people
[1:09:55] but as if the spirit of Christ is not in
[1:09:57] you you're not one of his
[1:10:00] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:10:03] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:10:06] because of righteousness the body is
[1:10:09] dead you have to reckon it dead
[1:10:12] Paul says that I have to but then also
[1:10:15] Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am who
[1:10:18] shall deliver me I find myself doing
[1:10:20] what I don't want to do and what I want
[1:10:22] to do I'm not doing
[1:10:24] not Paul not the one that wrote all
[1:10:26] these scriptures
[1:10:27] yes he was a man
[1:10:31] verse 11 but if the spirit of him that
[1:10:35] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:10:37] you
[1:10:37] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:10:40] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:10:42] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:10:46] to Quicken to bring to life
[1:10:50] something that we thought had life but
[1:10:53] was really dead
[1:10:55] I'm having a great time in the world I'm
[1:10:57] having a wonderful time doing all this
[1:10:59] but the scripture says you're dead
[1:11:02] just don't know it yet you know
[1:11:05] but if that it'll Quicken it'll bring to
[1:11:07] life and and to me I've always looked at
[1:11:10] this scripture the Rapture I'm going no
[1:11:12] it's right now
[1:11:14] it's what's happening today it's
[1:11:15] bringing it to life today
[1:11:18] this is
[1:11:19] and then for we'll go to verse 11. I
[1:11:23] mean verse 14. for as many as are led by
[1:11:27] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:11:30] God
[1:11:32] amen they are the sons of God it's an
[1:11:35] attribute of them more and more I look
[1:11:39] in the mirror and I see my dad
[1:11:41] I said boy that's I'm looking a lot like
[1:11:44] my father now
[1:11:45] and that's in the natural mirror I'm
[1:11:48] talking about and I I said well you know
[1:11:51] they always tell me don't get older
[1:11:53] because all those things began to happen
[1:11:56] but unless a Rapture takes place we're
[1:11:58] all going to get older
[1:12:00] and we look back now and and those
[1:12:03] things happen but I see my father and
[1:12:05] I've always said it's a good thing that
[1:12:07] I see my father in me
[1:12:10] because if I didn't see my father and me
[1:12:11] there might be a question who is my
[1:12:13] father
[1:12:15] but if I have the the attributes of my
[1:12:18] father then they say you're like your
[1:12:20] father
[1:12:21] and that's who a Christian is the
[1:12:22] attributes of the father
[1:12:25] and he says for ye have not received the
[1:12:30] spirit of bondage again to fear you were
[1:12:33] in bondage at one time
[1:12:35] and there was a fear with it have I done
[1:12:38] enough to please God is there enough
[1:12:41] works done to get me into heaven is this
[1:12:44] good enough or do I need to do more
[1:12:48] when will it be enough in your own
[1:12:51] goodness to get you there
[1:12:53] who's going to judge that
[1:12:56] who is the standard
[1:12:59] to be like Jesus
[1:13:02] but it's with his spirit
[1:13:05] he says before you have not received the
[1:13:08] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[1:13:10] have the received the spirit of adoption
[1:13:12] whereby we cry Abba Father my father my
[1:13:16] God
[1:13:20] verse 16 the spirit itself beareth
[1:13:23] witness with our spirits that we are the
[1:13:26] children of God
[1:13:28] you know I
[1:13:30] um
[1:13:31] I was my oldest daughter's birthday the
[1:13:34] other day
[1:13:35] and all she asked Mom was could you make
[1:13:38] tacos
[1:13:39] for my birthday
[1:13:41] and I said that's my daughter
[1:13:44] because she'll ask me what do you want
[1:13:46] to eat tacos you had him yesterday I
[1:13:48] said yeah that was yesterday today's
[1:13:49] yeah
[1:13:51] but you know just the simple things
[1:13:53] that's my daughter that's my son
[1:13:56] you know the father is up there and he's
[1:13:57] proud
[1:13:59] that those are my children look at them
[1:14:02] they're they're doing the things that
[1:14:03] please me you know
[1:14:06] and he said we are the children God and
[1:14:08] if children then heirs Heirs of God and
[1:14:12] Joint heirs with Christ
[1:14:14] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:14:17] also that we be also glorified together
[1:14:20] there is suffering a Christian Life
[1:14:24] some of the suffering we do ourselves
[1:14:27] with things that we know we shouldn't
[1:14:28] have done that we shouldn't have done it
[1:14:30] Lord forgive me but if you are a
[1:14:32] Christian Satan knows you're a Christian
[1:14:35] he knows a Christian a real true
[1:14:37] Christian and he's going to go after
[1:14:39] them he's going to try to cause them all
[1:14:41] he wants to make a display of you make
[1:14:44] others say well if that's Christianity I
[1:14:46] don't want any of it
[1:14:50] but if you go back into the New
[1:14:52] Testament and I love that and even in
[1:14:54] the ultimate it shows both sides of the
[1:14:56] life
[1:14:57] their failures their faults and the
[1:15:00] blessings and the wonderful things that
[1:15:02] God did Jacob wrestling with the angel
[1:15:05] was the same Jacob that defrauded his
[1:15:09] father
[1:15:10] but here he is wrestling with it shows
[1:15:12] both sides
[1:15:13] the same brother Branham who could stand
[1:15:15] here and say I take every Spirit under
[1:15:17] my control as the same brother at
[1:15:20] Branham that told sister me to tell them
[1:15:21] I'm not here and ran out the door
[1:15:24] the man's side
[1:15:27] you and I the same one that sister Melia
[1:15:29] wanted that Bible but also thinking she
[1:15:31] stole my Bible
[1:15:32] the evidence
[1:15:34] but she said I just wanted the word of
[1:15:37] God I wanted that back
[1:15:39] you know
[1:15:41] he said
[1:15:43] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:15:45] present time are not worthy to be
[1:15:47] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:15:49] revealed in US
[1:15:52] and you know
[1:15:53] That Glory is being revealed now
[1:15:57] that's not something that we wait till
[1:15:58] we get to heaven it should be being
[1:16:01] revealed that's Christ in you the hope
[1:16:03] of glory
[1:16:05] you say you know the Lord did this for
[1:16:08] me and somebody comes up to you and says
[1:16:10] you know there's a light about you
[1:16:12] there's something about you or whatever
[1:16:14] it is that you did and it's God being
[1:16:17] manifested in you
[1:16:19] it it it's it sometimes seems this
[1:16:22] little
[1:16:24] but it might be life to someone else
[1:16:27] if you just shared one sentence one word
[1:16:30] one scripture and it clicked in their
[1:16:32] heart and with that they gave their life
[1:16:34] to God
[1:16:35] it would be worth it all wouldn't it
[1:16:37] even though it was just one something
[1:16:39] minor would seem to you
[1:16:41] he says for the earnest expectation of
[1:16:44] the creature waited for the
[1:16:45] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:16:50] what is the manifestations of the sons
[1:16:52] of God they're just like Jesus
[1:16:57] they had to take notice that they had
[1:17:00] been with Jesus they're doing the same
[1:17:02] things they're acting the same way
[1:17:04] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:17:06] I have I give to you in the name of the
[1:17:08] Lord Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[1:17:11] was that Peter doing no it was Christ in
[1:17:14] him that's what the Holy Ghost is that's
[1:17:17] what the indwelling of the holy spirit
[1:17:18] is
[1:17:21] likewise the spirits also help us
[1:17:24] helpeth our infirmities
[1:17:27] and there's a lot of those sometimes
[1:17:30] you know I said for we know not what we
[1:17:33] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:17:36] spirit itself make us intercession for
[1:17:38] us with groanings which cannot be
[1:17:40] uttered
[1:17:41] and and that is the truth sometimes
[1:17:43] you're just there and you're groaning
[1:17:44] you're moaning you desire God so much
[1:17:47] you don't mind much you can't even put
[1:17:49] it into words
[1:17:52] sometimes I think maybe we put it into
[1:17:54] too many words
[1:17:56] we pray God a whole Bible
[1:17:59] and God is looking past all that he said
[1:18:01] I know what you have native and they
[1:18:03] know how to work it
[1:18:07] and so and that he searches the heart he
[1:18:09] that searches the heart knows what is
[1:18:11] the mind of the spirit
[1:18:13] because he maketh the intercession for
[1:18:15] the Saints according to the will of God
[1:18:20] what is best for you what is best for me
[1:18:23] that is the acts of the holy spirit in
[1:18:26] you and in me
[1:18:28] and if you want to see how it acts go
[1:18:30] back to the scripture and let's see how
[1:18:31] it acts
[1:18:32] go back to to to those that got to be
[1:18:36] around brother Branham they thought he
[1:18:37] was God
[1:18:39] because he lived this
[1:18:44] it actually worked
[1:18:47] if they lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:18:49] recover
[1:18:50] it was a man of faith and you say well
[1:18:52] God gave him that gift yet but he had to
[1:18:55] accept and believe it too
[1:18:57] just like you have to believe it for
[1:18:59] yourself
[1:19:00] and and sometimes I think the the
[1:19:02] problem becomes when we have time to
[1:19:03] think about it
[1:19:06] and we talk ourselves out of a promise
[1:19:08] we think ourselves out of a situation
[1:19:11] but if you stand there and you say I am
[1:19:13] a child of God and you let God Act
[1:19:16] watch what he'll do
[1:19:18] there was a uh two brothers and and they
[1:19:21] were at a at work
[1:19:24] and it was right next to the road
[1:19:27] and somebody got run over in front of
[1:19:29] them
[1:19:30] and they ran over to see and I believe
[1:19:32] it was a lady and she was on the on the
[1:19:34] road
[1:19:35] and um
[1:19:39] like hopeless is what they thought and
[1:19:42] the other brother who saw them go he
[1:19:45] goes did you even pray for her
[1:19:47] and the other brother stopped because I
[1:19:49] didn't even think of it he goes well
[1:19:50] that should have been the first thing
[1:19:51] you should have done reached out and
[1:19:53] asked
[1:19:54] but sometimes we look at a situation and
[1:19:56] say it's hopeless
[1:19:57] but there's nothing hopeless to God
[1:20:00] there's nothing too far gone
[1:20:02] is able to take and restore
[1:20:06] you know and and I have found some of my
[1:20:09] greatest blessings when I didn't stop to
[1:20:11] think about it but just ask God to take
[1:20:13] care of it
[1:20:15] I didn't tell Lord this is how you need
[1:20:17] to do it
[1:20:18] but Lord can you take care of this and
[1:20:20] he does
[1:20:21] he knows how to do that
[1:20:26] he that searches the heart no noeth what
[1:20:28] is the mind of the spirit because he
[1:20:30] make his intercession for the Saints
[1:20:32] according to the will of God
[1:20:34] and I like this and we know that all
[1:20:36] things work together for good to them
[1:20:38] that love God to them who are called
[1:20:40] according to his purpose
[1:20:43] even though
[1:20:45] the wrong turn you go down the wrong
[1:20:46] Street you have to Make U-turn to come
[1:20:48] back and you're a little frustrated
[1:20:50] because you lost five minutes
[1:20:53] but God said okay in those five minutes
[1:20:55] I took care of this
[1:20:58] sometimes we just have to say Thank You
[1:21:00] Lord you know what's best for me
[1:21:03] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:21:05] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:21:08] image of his son that he might be the
[1:21:10] firstborn among many brethren
[1:21:14] predestinate by foreknowledge
[1:21:17] he understood he knew why it wasn't just
[1:21:20] a random choice
[1:21:22] but he knew you would be part of there
[1:21:23] you were part of him
[1:21:26] moreover whom he did predestinate he
[1:21:29] also called and whom he called
[1:21:32] them he also Justified and whom he
[1:21:35] justified them he also glorified
[1:21:38] to be justified
[1:21:42] brother green used to say he's a crooked
[1:21:45] as lawyer around
[1:21:47] he takes the evidence that of what you
[1:21:50] did and gets rid of it
[1:21:53] and then he says no they didn't do it
[1:21:54] prove it to me that he did it because he
[1:21:57] took care of it
[1:21:59] through the blood I can come and do his
[1:22:01] presence
[1:22:02] it's been washed it's been cleaned
[1:22:05] but sometimes we come into the prayer
[1:22:07] his try to come in his presence with the
[1:22:08] memories of what we've done
[1:22:10] Lord I don't know how many
[1:22:13] he says come and put it under the blood
[1:22:15] come into that direction and let me deal
[1:22:17] with it
[1:22:19] I've heard testimonies of those who have
[1:22:21] come to the altar
[1:22:23] with a cigarette happen and just leave
[1:22:26] it right there and walk out without it
[1:22:28] that habit
[1:22:30] let God took it then he'd come up and
[1:22:33] say Lord I did a hundred years or 100
[1:22:35] days of good works now you owe it to me
[1:22:38] they come up here and say Lord I've got
[1:22:39] a habit can you get rid of it for me and
[1:22:42] God do it
[1:22:48] what shall we say then to these things
[1:22:50] if God before us who can be against us
[1:22:54] well I'll tell you who I struggled the
[1:22:56] most with against us and that's me
[1:22:58] that's the one I struggle the most with
[1:23:01] because I say God how could you love
[1:23:03] this how could you put up with this
[1:23:05] and he says because I love you because I
[1:23:08] care for you because you're one of mine
[1:23:13] you know it's it's it's
[1:23:15] you know I'll say this because it is
[1:23:17] true when you have more than one child
[1:23:20] you look at this one and you compare
[1:23:22] them sometimes and you say this one and
[1:23:24] they compare each other I heard one man
[1:23:26] say
[1:23:27] we had two children there for I could
[1:23:30] have my favorite and she could have her
[1:23:31] favorite you know
[1:23:33] just kind of laughed about it but
[1:23:36] that's human We compare we look and we
[1:23:39] say
[1:23:40] but God looks at us all the same
[1:23:45] there's not one more Bader there's not
[1:23:48] one worse there's not one less they are
[1:23:51] all children of God
[1:23:53] we ought to look at one another that
[1:23:56] same way
[1:24:00] if God before us who can be against us
[1:24:02] who
[1:24:03] shall lay anything
[1:24:06] to the charge of God's elect it is God's
[1:24:10] it is God that justifies
[1:24:14] when I looked at that who I tend to do
[1:24:16] it to myself
[1:24:19] that's the one yeah sister Shirley yes
[1:24:22] no problem she's a saint she's perfect
[1:24:24] she doesn't have an issue
[1:24:27] but that sister surely tell her side of
[1:24:29] it
[1:24:30] I have my struggles I have more hard
[1:24:32] times
[1:24:33] you know I know brother Dave Fritz there
[1:24:35] a perfect man
[1:24:38] are you awake Dave yeah he moved his
[1:24:40] head
[1:24:41] you know I just
[1:24:42] that's who we are
[1:24:44] the struggle is within ourselves
[1:24:47] I can give Grace to everybody but I have
[1:24:50] to also say Lord I'm yours also I'm your
[1:24:53] child
[1:24:56] and he says
[1:24:58] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[1:25:00] that died yea rather that is risen again
[1:25:03] who is even at the right hand of God who
[1:25:06] also maketh intercession for us
[1:25:11] father
[1:25:12] they didn't mean to do that
[1:25:15] in their in their intentions they wanted
[1:25:17] to do right they wanted but but they
[1:25:19] made a mistake
[1:25:21] forgive them
[1:25:23] and the father looks down at that
[1:25:25] sacrifice and he says it's all taken
[1:25:27] care of it's covered it's paid for
[1:25:31] then he goes on to say
[1:25:34] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:25:36] God
[1:25:37] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:25:40] persecution or famine or naked or Peril
[1:25:44] or sword
[1:25:45] or my own thoughts my own feelings my
[1:25:48] own actions
[1:25:51] no nothing shall separate us from the
[1:25:54] love of God he loved us
[1:25:57] you heard brother green always said this
[1:25:59] one he said
[1:26:00] could God love you more
[1:26:04] and he said no he's loved you fully
[1:26:07] perfectly completely his love is perfect
[1:26:10] could he love you less no he loves you
[1:26:14] so what can you do about it you can love
[1:26:16] him more
[1:26:18] but he's loved you he gave his life he
[1:26:20] did everything for you he's provided for
[1:26:22] that already
[1:26:25] he says
[1:26:27] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:26:29] killed all the day long we are counted
[1:26:31] as sheep for the slaughter I wonder
[1:26:33] sometimes when Paul writes it was
[1:26:35] writing these words how much he's being
[1:26:36] troubled himself
[1:26:38] about himself but under inspiration he's
[1:26:41] writing this
[1:26:42] you know he says on every side we're
[1:26:45] persecuted on every side where but then
[1:26:47] he says nay in all things we are more
[1:26:49] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:26:51] us
[1:26:53] we are more than conquerors
[1:26:56] I like brother Green's description of a
[1:26:59] conqueror
[1:27:00] the boxer got into the boxing ring
[1:27:03] and fought all 12 rounds and he beat the
[1:27:07] other man he was the winner the
[1:27:08] Conqueror and then they gave him the
[1:27:10] check and he went home and he gave it to
[1:27:13] his wife and she was more than the
[1:27:16] Conqueror
[1:27:18] we are the benefits of the one who
[1:27:20] conquered all
[1:27:22] and he says we are more than conquerors
[1:27:25] we receive the benefits of what he did
[1:27:28] for us
[1:27:31] for I am persuaded he says
[1:27:34] that neither death nor life nor angels
[1:27:38] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[1:27:41] present nor things to come what you're
[1:27:44] going through today
[1:27:46] the battles that you're going through
[1:27:48] today
[1:27:49] if you live through tomorrow what you go
[1:27:50] those things to come nothing he says
[1:27:54] I am persuaded nor height nor depth nor
[1:27:58] any other creature shall be able to
[1:28:00] separate us from the love of God which
[1:28:03] is in Christ Jesus our lord
[1:28:07] now if that same spirit that raised
[1:28:09] Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:28:13] that's Christ Jesus our lord
[1:28:17] so nothing shall separate you from the
[1:28:20] love of God
[1:28:22] unless you refuse to accept it
[1:28:26] unless you refuse it
[1:28:28] that's your choice
[1:28:30] that that Rich Young Ruler
[1:28:33] he comes good Master what should I do
[1:28:36] what can I do to inherit eternal life
[1:28:39] the Lord looks at him and the Bible says
[1:28:41] he loved that young man
[1:28:43] and he says do this this he goes I've
[1:28:45] done that since my youth I've obeyed the
[1:28:47] law
[1:28:49] one thing thou has he looks past that
[1:28:51] bingoes here's your issue
[1:28:54] sell all that you have
[1:28:57] and give it to the poor and come follow
[1:28:59] me
[1:29:01] and a man stopped for a minute he goes
[1:29:03] wow
[1:29:06] just can't do that
[1:29:08] I just can't do that yet he said the
[1:29:11] Lord love that man
[1:29:16] but he couldn't give up that last little
[1:29:19] bit what is it
[1:29:21] I really have to look at my own life
[1:29:22] what is it that I'm still holding on to
[1:29:25] nor Heights he said for I am persuaded
[1:29:28] that neither death nor life nor angels
[1:29:30] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[1:29:33] present nor things to come nor height
[1:29:36] nor death nor any other creature shall
[1:29:40] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:29:42] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[1:29:46] now the holy spirit is God in spirit
[1:29:50] form in you
[1:29:53] not the physical body but his Spirit his
[1:29:56] presence in you
[1:29:58] he's with you where you go and brother
[1:30:01] Brandon makes this statement he says
[1:30:03] sometimes you can offend him
[1:30:06] sometimes we offend each other
[1:30:09] sometimes I tell her she says what's
[1:30:11] going on I'm just going to go outside
[1:30:13] and I'm going to clean the yard
[1:30:16] because I'm upset and rather than take
[1:30:18] it out on her or one of them I take it
[1:30:21] out on the weeds and the dirt and
[1:30:22] everything else
[1:30:23] and then when I've tired and burned it
[1:30:25] all out then I come back in and I sit
[1:30:27] down with her and I say okay let's make
[1:30:29] this right
[1:30:30] because all the anger is now burned out
[1:30:32] all of that and you're not going to do
[1:30:34] something you're going to regret even
[1:30:35] more so
[1:30:36] it works for me it may not work for you
[1:30:38] but it works for me that way if I'm
[1:30:39] frustrated get away from it for a while
[1:30:42] let it burn off let it go away and then
[1:30:45] come and speak reasonably yeah you know
[1:30:48] where we're not having then to make
[1:30:50] something else right again and and we do
[1:30:52] those things we get angry we get upset
[1:30:55] we get hurt we react
[1:30:57] you know and then
[1:30:59] the quickest way
[1:31:01] the fastest way to resolve that is just
[1:31:04] say I'm sorry
[1:31:06] forgive me I didn't mean to do that
[1:31:08] honestly
[1:31:11] and and forgiveness is in two parts
[1:31:15] you ask for forgiveness
[1:31:17] the person forgives you
[1:31:20] and then you have to forgive yourself
[1:31:24] I have put it under the blood therefore
[1:31:26] it's not there anymore
[1:31:28] and yet you have to believe that that
[1:31:31] when God forgives you and cleanses you
[1:31:34] it's done with
[1:31:35] don't bring it up again
[1:31:37] now tomorrow you might fail again and
[1:31:40] you might have to make that right again
[1:31:42] but that there is no record in there
[1:31:45] brother Ram talks about that Vision when
[1:31:47] he saw the book
[1:31:49] it opened up there was nothing against
[1:31:52] him in the book it had been cleaned it
[1:31:54] had been washed it had been erased it's
[1:31:56] been thrown into the sea of God's
[1:31:58] forgetfulness
[1:31:59] and if he can't bring it up then don't
[1:32:02] bring it up yourself either
[1:32:05] and sometimes we live too much in the
[1:32:07] memories of things that have happened I
[1:32:09] was talking with a brother one day
[1:32:11] and I told him about that experience of
[1:32:13] making that right at
[1:32:15] at Old Tucson
[1:32:17] and he says brother Aaron what about
[1:32:19] some things that happened way back in
[1:32:21] your life that you don't even know where
[1:32:23] those people are you have
[1:32:25] how what do you do about those
[1:32:28] I said I know what you're talking about
[1:32:30] because there are some things that
[1:32:31] people I wish I could go back and say
[1:32:33] I'm sorry when I did that to you
[1:32:36] but sometimes you can't
[1:32:39] who knows what happened when you've
[1:32:41] never seen them again you're never you
[1:32:42] know that which you can make right you
[1:32:44] make right you do right
[1:32:46] the rest you have to put under the blood
[1:32:48] and say Lord I'm sorry
[1:32:53] but again nor heightened nor depth nor
[1:32:55] any other creature
[1:32:57] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:32:59] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:33:02] lord
[1:33:04] and you know which creature you suffer
[1:33:06] with most
[1:33:09] how many knows which creature it has
[1:33:10] brother Silas said it's him
[1:33:12] he pointed at himself we should all be
[1:33:15] pointing at our own selves this is the
[1:33:17] one you suffer with the most this is the
[1:33:18] one that you take with you go everywhere
[1:33:20] this is the one this is the one that
[1:33:22] gives you most of the trouble
[1:33:25] but he says no creature shall
[1:33:29] God looks at you through the blood
[1:33:32] the acts of the Holy Spirit
[1:33:34] in you it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:33:37] glory
[1:33:39] and you know it's it's one of those
[1:33:42] things sometimes that we
[1:33:45] I could I say we overthink it
[1:33:49] and and sometimes and and I I get to
[1:33:53] thinking about the things that this God
[1:33:55] has done
[1:33:56] for me it overwhelms me and I just say
[1:33:59] Lord you've been so good to me and then
[1:34:01] I get to the thinking about the things
[1:34:03] I've done to him and I'm saying Lord how
[1:34:05] can you even be want to be around me
[1:34:08] you know
[1:34:10] but I'm his son
[1:34:11] when he takes that that example of the
[1:34:14] of the father and the Prodigal Son
[1:34:17] the the son that went out and took his
[1:34:19] inheritance and went and wasted it
[1:34:23] but it says the father was looking out
[1:34:25] for the sun to come back
[1:34:28] the Sun finally comes to himself
[1:34:31] and says the servants in My Father's
[1:34:33] House live better than I do they can eat
[1:34:36] they have a place to sleep they have and
[1:34:38] here I am in the in the pig pen
[1:34:40] fighting with the pigs for for their
[1:34:42] food and I'm trying to eat it myself I'm
[1:34:44] a mess
[1:34:45] it doesn't say how long it took but
[1:34:47] there came a time when he came to that
[1:34:48] place
[1:34:50] and he says I'll go back to my father's
[1:34:52] house
[1:34:54] and that was the first thing I'll go
[1:34:56] back to my father's house
[1:34:59] go back to him
[1:35:02] he's the one that loves you
[1:35:04] he's the one that cares for you he knows
[1:35:06] you by name he knows who you are he
[1:35:08] knows everything about you
[1:35:10] and he loves you anyways
[1:35:14] and and he goes I'll go back to my
[1:35:16] father's house
[1:35:18] and I'll come back and I'll tell him dad
[1:35:20] I made a mess in my life
[1:35:22] I've wasted all the inheritance I did
[1:35:25] things I should have never done this and
[1:35:27] the other I got to a point dad that I
[1:35:28] was living in the pig pen with the pigs
[1:35:31] remember I remember how when when I was
[1:35:33] younger you counseled me I remember all
[1:35:35] the things you shared with me I remember
[1:35:37] what you told me and you gave me good
[1:35:39] advice but I went against it and I left
[1:35:42] and I did these things
[1:35:44] is there any hope for me I'll just be a
[1:35:48] servant of yours
[1:35:50] they get treated better they're treated
[1:35:52] better than how I'm living
[1:35:53] and he's coming back up thinking all
[1:35:56] those things going through his mind that
[1:35:57] the scripture talks about but he's come
[1:35:59] back and said this is what I'm going to
[1:36:01] ask my father this is how I'm going to
[1:36:02] ask for forgiveness this is what I'm
[1:36:04] going to do
[1:36:06] but the father is on this side looking
[1:36:07] for the return of his son
[1:36:11] wait in fact he has a robe there for him
[1:36:14] he is prepared to receive his son
[1:36:17] but I've always wondered what the
[1:36:19] neighbors thought
[1:36:21] they seen the son leave
[1:36:23] there was probably a great commotion
[1:36:26] when he left
[1:36:27] my son is going out he's going to do
[1:36:29] this and he I'm going to be this I'm
[1:36:30] going to be that you know
[1:36:32] now here they see the sun coming up
[1:36:36] and doesn't look like the same guy that
[1:36:37] left
[1:36:39] he looks like a poor wretched beggar
[1:36:41] destroyed
[1:36:43] and they're probably maybe look at that
[1:36:47] look look what he's done with this life
[1:36:48] you know
[1:36:49] but the fathers runs towards his son
[1:36:54] he became me so that by I could become
[1:36:58] him through his love
[1:37:01] the father runs to him and the son says
[1:37:03] Dad
[1:37:05] I've made a mess in my life I'm not
[1:37:07] worthy to become be called your son not
[1:37:10] worthy at all let me be one of your
[1:37:13] servants I'll go and I'll live I'll live
[1:37:15] in the bunk house I'll clean the yard
[1:37:17] I'll do this I'll do that he goes you're
[1:37:20] my son
[1:37:22] you were my son from the beginning
[1:37:23] you'll always be my son
[1:37:30] this water cup stays here all the time
[1:37:32] and I always wonder at the end of
[1:37:33] service why didn't I drink any
[1:37:35] yeah
[1:37:37] but you're my son
[1:37:40] but he had a brother
[1:37:42] who never left
[1:37:45] his father's house
[1:37:49] and he gets upset at the father
[1:37:52] because his son who had gone out into
[1:37:54] the world and done all those things is
[1:37:56] now being treated and and you know
[1:37:59] exalted in front of everybody
[1:38:02] so when they came to where they had the
[1:38:04] the older brother wasn't there so his
[1:38:06] dad calls for him and he says where were
[1:38:08] you he said I've never left you Dad I've
[1:38:11] never done anything like that I've been
[1:38:13] the good boy I've I've been the one
[1:38:15] that's made you proud I'm the one that
[1:38:16] should be inheriting everything that's
[1:38:18] yours
[1:38:19] and you've never given me a party like
[1:38:21] you did for my brother who made a mess
[1:38:23] out of his life
[1:38:24] and he goes son all this is yours you
[1:38:26] just chose not to participate and take
[1:38:28] part of it
[1:38:32] all this is yours
[1:38:34] every promise in the book is mine every
[1:38:36] chapter every verse every line but if I
[1:38:39] choose not to participate in it
[1:38:42] who's at fault
[1:38:44] I am
[1:38:46] you know
[1:38:48] the dinner is served and you choose not
[1:38:50] to eat
[1:38:52] what
[1:38:54] you know you can't blame the person that
[1:38:56] prepared the meal you chose not to eat
[1:39:01] you know
[1:39:03] I was listening
[1:39:05] reading listening to questions and
[1:39:07] answers
[1:39:09] and they asked brother Branham the
[1:39:11] question I think this was in the
[1:39:12] question answers in 64.
[1:39:15] and they asked brother Branham he said
[1:39:17] can we go should we go to another church
[1:39:22] or if you're not here he says can we
[1:39:25] should we go or should we not should we
[1:39:27] not go to another church unless you're
[1:39:28] preaching there
[1:39:30] and brother Brown says no no no
[1:39:32] absolutely not go to another church even
[1:39:35] if all you receive is one bite go get
[1:39:38] that bite
[1:39:40] be a brother be a friend
[1:39:43] what a difference in the spirit
[1:39:46] you know Jesus walked amongst the lowly
[1:39:49] the common people
[1:39:52] it was when they come looking for him
[1:39:53] they couldn't fight he couldn't find him
[1:39:55] because he disappeared right amongst the
[1:39:56] common people
[1:39:58] he became me
[1:40:00] so that I could become like him
[1:40:03] the musicians would come up
[1:40:06] brother Matt he would come up also
[1:40:10] the acts of the Holy Spirit In You
[1:40:16] that's what it's there for you can't do
[1:40:19] this by yourself
[1:40:22] you can't earn enough points to get into
[1:40:25] him and it's not a point system it's a
[1:40:26] token
[1:40:27] and he paid for it already
[1:40:29] he's already met the price he's already
[1:40:31] provided it
[1:40:33] you know
[1:40:35] we um we went up to the Flagstaff
[1:40:37] meetings last year
[1:40:40] we've been going up for a few years now
[1:40:43] enjoyed the time away enjoying the
[1:40:45] fellowship up there and all
[1:40:47] and we had rented a hotel or motel
[1:40:51] through
[1:40:52] the Flagstaff Tabernacle
[1:40:54] they set some aside and get it at a
[1:40:56] better price and
[1:40:57] brother Steve called me and he said
[1:40:59] brother Aaron how many of you are coming
[1:41:00] up I said just me and my wife
[1:41:03] and he goes could we move you to a a
[1:41:06] different place because we got a family
[1:41:07] that needs the two rooms
[1:41:10] I said sure whatever he goes he says we
[1:41:13] got an Airbnb and you guys can stay in
[1:41:15] there at no charge
[1:41:18] I didn't ask for them
[1:41:20] that wasn't in our thoughts we were
[1:41:21] going to go pay
[1:41:23] so I said well if that'll work that'll
[1:41:25] that'll be okay you know
[1:41:28] turned out to be a nice little place
[1:41:30] didn't it a very very nice place and it
[1:41:33] was owned by a brother so there was no
[1:41:35] Spirits in there it was a nice place we
[1:41:38] stayed in there
[1:41:39] five minutes away from the church
[1:41:42] so when it was time to leave
[1:41:47] my wife said we're going to clean this
[1:41:48] place very nice we're going to leave it
[1:41:51] and span
