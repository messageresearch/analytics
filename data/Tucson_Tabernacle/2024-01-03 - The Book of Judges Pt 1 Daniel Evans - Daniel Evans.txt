chap 2: 11 and 12 it was my scripture of the day read it this morning and I was reading it again this this afternoon or evening before we stepped in and look what Paul says here and what we're going to be hearing in the book of of Judges here for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world I was reading through the first few chapters of the Book of Judges again and and God you know with Moses is with them and all you know they're serving the lord they have a someone to kind of look to and and and and follow his footsteps but after Moses passes away and we begin to see how they turn their back on God and God says because you've done that he says now I'm going to give you over to them and then they would come back running to God and say we did wrong and his great mercy and his grace reached out to them and then they would turn his back on him and they would run but Paul tells us deny those things and live Godly you know and let Christ live in you and I I just thought that was a good scripture to go with with what we'll be hearing today so we do have some requests I'm going to ask brother Ed if he'll he'll come up in and open in prayer and take the request brother Ed says that their son Nate Cen has an urgent unspoken request for a young man so Lord knows who that is and then sister Martha said prayer for Dan Miller a friend from rapidly spreading cancer so Lord knows who this is Sister Mercy somano had mentioned to my wife that that she's been having a lot of pain in her arm so we'll remember remember her also and continue to remember Sister Sarah codner as she was had gone in possibly think she might have pneumonia but they found strep if I understand and they're still waiting on some results from the test so let's believe if you'll stand with me and brother Ed if you'll open in prayer and take these requests and it's it's good to have brother Ed here on a Wednesday night in case you know this is the same brother Ed that's here on Sunday morning work is done for a while so he gets to stay home I'm blessed to be able to be back home and be here at church so let's pray gracious Heavenly Father our hearts Rejoice just to be able to be here father this evening Lord we're few but that doesn't make a

get the the bigger that the fire is so God bless you brother welcome and we appreciate you coming I um made a couple announce ments this morning I'd like to reiterate those that uh we have our communion service this Sunday and as always it's something very very important take this very very seriously the Bible says that a man should again examine himself that's what we should be doing this week in PR preparation for Sunday night when we take the Lord's body and his blood doing in in remembrance of of him um and then I also mentioned that this Friday there's a youth service at brother osario church he um their church is down by the airport please attend I think it'll be a blessing to you brother asario has been so supportive of us here um appreciate when we get the youth together that uh brother Isaac brother sario son is and all the crew has always come so we we really appreciate them and I want to show our support to u to them for this this Friday's youth service and then I also mentioned at the end of this month um we all got together and we packed a bunch of boxes and got everything ready I want to put those boxes on the road I want to get those to brother Caleb Perez's church over in Los Cruses so I would like to make a trip especially with the youth but everyone's welcome later on the last weekend of this month we'll go on a Saturday and uh we'll we'll stay

not I scheduled brother Ryan long good friend and a brother I have a lot of confidence in he'll be ministering that Sunday morning here so um think about those things I know that there it's a blessing friends anytime that we can get together sister hope that song I think that song is is my life that I can't even walk without him holding my hand I think of how much he has done for me and how I thought that maybe I could do something and how many times I've failed in my life but he just reached down that hand and picked me up and just walked me around and and I I want to stay completely depend dependent on him thank you for that song and I also appreciate brother Aaron giving thanks to to the Lord for work I've heard brother Aaron give thanks to the Lord for giving him some time off and brother Aaron it's also good to thank the Lord for when he gives us work you know we take it for granted and we should always give the Lord thanks for what he does for us a good job is something that is is precious and I I appreciate that brother Aon I appreciate given thanks at all for all things and all the time we should always praise the Lord and never complain friends there should never be a complaint coming out of our mouths um for the Book of Judges I I won't get through it today I'll get through the the first part of it and then uh we will um pick it up on um on the next Bible study that we have in the coming weeks sister Bonnie Marriott as I was leaving church on Sunday I don't know if she knew she they don't come usually on Wednesday night but I don't know if she knew that judges was going to be my sermon on Wednesday but as I was leaving church or as she was leaving at church church on Sunday morning I shook her hand and she grabbed my hand and and she pulled it to me and she said these words something on the order of I think this whole thing has become the Book of Judges and I knew what she meant and she was talking about how that we just fall into sin so easily and I think about this Book of Judges and boy it's a depressing book and it's been bothering me all week last night I woke up and I was repenting I was just feeling bad for everything that Israel had done in this book and and all the mistakes that they had made and just setting the Lord aside and I was as I was laying in bed this morning I was thinking about all the failures of Israel and then the thought came to my mind that how similar we are to these Israelites and what happened to them you know of all the books in the Old Testament I think the Book of Judges is the most applicable to not only our society that we live in but also in in the churches and the in the circles that we Fellowship in I look at look at how things have gone and and This Book of Judges it's just this continuing cycle of of the people a a man of God will come in and then God will bless Israel because the people will serve the Lord and then that man of God will be taken off the scene and then the people fall into sin and they do exactly what that man of God taught against and then they'll get themselves into this big mess and then they'll cry out to the Lord and then the Lord will send them another servant of the Lord and then they'll start living better and just over and over and over again and I I was laying in bed this morning I was thinking Lord how much have we done that how much has has the people that claim to believe that this man came back in the 1950s and 60s a great man by the name of William brandom and changed just changed really the whole religious landscape changed the world brought a message that people could see that God was alive alive and God he he was actually was a living breathing God that did things and wasn't a god of 2,000 years ago and how people would come through the prayer lines and and they would be healed and probably all of us know or have met people that have been healed and then God sends this man and he has a message behind it and that message friends I say it a lot but that message is not what we hear today in our churches it makes it just Grieves me so much and in reading this This Book of Judges I think Lord that's us we have fallen right back into the sin that this man tried to pull us out of and when I say the sin what did brother brandom preach almost every sermon that he preached the Lord Jesus and come out of those denominations we just listen to a Christmas message and he preached about denominations he preached against the sectarian form of worship where we draw a circle around ourselves and we say that we are better than someone else and brother brandham came and he hit that thing and he said this is false Doctrine come out of the Methodist and come out of the Baptist and come out of these things and he also said that there are three kinds of Believers in every in every Church saying very much that these methodists and Baptists and all and and all of these denominates they are believers there we ignore that part of what he said and we separate ourselves and draw a circle and I see that brother brandham hid it and then when he passed away what did we do we did exactly what he taught us against we formed this denomination or this cult called the message he did not preach that his message was Jesus Christ and him crucified and his message was come out of that he even called it the mark of the beast why why would he hit that so hard and and make a statement so strong as that it's because the people are believing because they're part of a religious system or they are part of a church or a part of the Catholic denomination the the Methodist or the Baptist or the message or whatever it is they think that that's going to save them they think that they're going to get to heaven because of this and it dest destroys the word of God and it destroys Jesus Christ in the person and what they do is they don't seek the Holy Spirit what they do is they seek a church and then they lift up this man of God whether it be Joshua Moses one of the judges they lift up this man of God as their champion and it makes it to where they don't have to receive this Holy Spirit and then the churches the min history lifts it up so much and says how great we are and doesn't push saying that you must receive the holy spirit that you must have that personal relationship with Christ that you must know him let me tell you if we don't know him I'm talking about me if I don't know Jesus Christ William brandom was a failure in my life because I can't get on I can't get into heaven on him or his message I have to get into heaven on a Jesus Christ and him crucified and that I know him and that I have received his Spirit into my life and it makes me friends it makes me so it just it's just got me so upset thinking that we have created as I said on Sunday we have created this image of what we think God should be and then this is how we're going to get saved and this is how our church should be and it's false it's in our minds and we have done exactly what I'm going to read about in This Book of Judges so as I'm reading this this isn't this isn't 3,000 years ago this is true today and I really believe more than any other book in the New Testament the Book of Judges The Book of Malachi is very similar too but the Book of Judges and how we immediately leave the gospel when that man leaves and we fall right back into idolatry or right back into denominations or right back into what it is exactly what he said to come out of I was was thinking about that today and I'm I'm studying and it's getting me all worked up and and there I am in my chair and and praying like Lord and then I start I get a text from somebody I haven't talked to in a year or two and he tells me he says brother he says uh I just wanted to say Happy New Year um yeah I got kicked out of my church Message Church Minister because he was preaching that no we don't we have to we have to have Jesus Christ and being the bride or whatever it is is not because of a man it's because of Christ and he started he was teaching almost the a very similar thing saying that these Pharisees and Sadducees had an image in their in their minds of how a a Believer should be and that's exactly what so-called message churches do today is they have this image and it's all about the man and not about Jesus and they said basically you can't preach it here anymore and that's what we've become we've become exactly what brother brandom said come out of that makes me it breaks it breaks my heart that people get so caught up they W even friends they wouldn't even go to church going to church is wrong remember I talked about the Sadducees thank God again that we went through the book of Acts the Sadducees right there they were too good they wouldn't even believe any of the other prophets they only had one Prophet his name was Moses that arrogant spirit and sinful people sinful I'm I'm not talking about drinking and smoking on the weekends which is sinful talking about worse than that I'm talking about self-righteous judgmental egotistical rotten Sinners we think we always think of a sinner we think of the the prostitute walking down the street or the homeless guy sitting on the corner smoking meth or whatever he's doing who is the worst center is it him or is it the sadducee they're both dirty in the sight of the Lord but one is willing to repent the other one's not I was thinking about that and I was thinking about all these different groups that we've gone into and how we draw our circles and we cut everybody else out oh but we draw our Circle bigger no we don't that is so ridiculous people that would say that we really don't we will draw our circle around somebody that believes at least mostly like me but somebody that doesn't man we'll cut them out Jesus or no Jesus it's sad but it's the truth it should be Jesus Christ and him alone and that is what brother Brandon preached the other day I was talking to somebody we were going through the the table the message search program I said do this I said go in there pick any tape any date any page any paragraph and what's it going to be talking about so we did it we did it like 10 times almost every time he was talking about the Lord Jesus try it it's awesome that was his everything but instead we go off and we don't listen to what he said I was thinking about that today and I was I was texting back and forth from this with his brother and I was uh updating the website and uh working on on YouTube and putting some links in there and uh a sermon popped up of uh brother Perry green and uh looked at it and uh I was like I wonder so I I scrubbed forward and I turned it on there's brother green talking about all the different denominations within the message and he was talking about the seven Thunders and he says they don't know if that's been revealed or not he was talking about the same thing like hey they're just this is just a division between all of us I uh let me let me read to you a quote from brother brandom and he's talking about I think he's talking about Gideon one of the judges brother BR preached this sermon if God be with us then where all the Miracles and it's about Gideon that's what Gideon said Gideon's like if God be with us and he saw all the sin in Israel and everybody's talking about how great they are and we've got the message and we've got all this and Joshua and Moses and everything but Gideon says well where are all the Miracles then he said brother bam said this few years before this talking about Gideon had been the prophetess Deborah and baric and how that she had prophesied and told them what to do and it was exactly right baric the great warrior and how they made a song of the triumph over the enemy but as soon as they got out of the twist right straight back into the rut they went again if that isn't the picture of the church today just as soon as it gets out of one twist right into another one it goes but the time but time had come for action and that's the same now the time has come for Action the time had come when playing when playing church had come to a halt with God there's no more playing church we must get down to business and I trust that same God will place this upon the heart of the people tonight that it's time for a halt of playing Church playing religious playing righteous and now it's time for Action as I was speaking this morning upon the subject of what the new birth was and how we come to it surely that still sinks in your heart now the time has come to act upon what you know to be the truth you cannot act with Faith until first you know what you're doing you've got to first know what you are doing before you can have faith to do it then on that same tape brother Ram's closing and he says this oh God let us see a coming year this is a New Year's Eve message let us see a coming year till our hearts will not be satisfied with a church denomination or Creed with a handshake or so-called religion let us not be satisfied till we feel the miracle working power in God in our own Hearts taking the world out and forming Christ now not tonight and tomorrow start doing something else but grow in him up to his stature we grow up to him until we meet him that was his message brother Lyall that's what he preached he preached Jesus Christ knowing him growing in him find a sermon that he didn't preach that and we claim to believe him with all of our differences and sectarianism and all of our denominational ways we claim to believe the man that preached that every service and that's what judges is the Book of Judges shows that the people got their eyes off of God and their eyes on the world Joshua's final statements you know this one he says choose this day whom you will serve as for me in my house will serve the Lord and Israel when he said that Israel responded saying we want to do the same thing we want to serve the Lord too friends the world isn't just influencers on Tik Tock teaching our young people to sin and to look and act like the world but it also shows in This Book of Judges that it is a religious spirit it's worshiping Gods worshiping gods that were not Jehovah worshiping an image created in their mind and that image isn't real those Gods weren't real it's the same thing with us sometimes we make up something and we think that this is how religion is so I'll do this and I'll pray this way and all of that it's not real you got to know Jesus talk to him about it and then when you have that relationship then some then God will start moving sin followed these the worship of these these other gods and that's exactly why Joshua told the people to drive out these Canaanites from the land the promised land over Jordan brother brother Lyle just finished with the Book of Joshua they came over the the river into the promised land that God had promised way back all the way to Abraham they come over into this promised land and then God says now start driving them out start pushing them out remember they go to Jericho and they find Rahab and and then they go to I believe it was Ai and then they go on and on and on and on and they start driving these inhabitants of the land away and the Canaanites as is going to be referred to in this book the that's just a general statement for the people that live there that's the hites and the moabites and the jebusites and and all the land all the IES that lived out in the land and God knew that these people were going to influence them the Book of Judges it lasts about 400 years I I read a lot of different commentaries on it anywhere from 300 to 500 years but it looks like it was about 4 400 years that that this book covers and the same thing happens over and over in these entire 400 years and you can just pick wherever you want to open the Bible in that book and it'll be saying the same thing Israel does evil in the eyes of the Lord the people are given into the hands of their enemies they cry out to God for mercy God raises up a leader the spirit of God comes upon that leader the leader defeats the enemy and then peace is restored as long as that leader lives and then the cycle repeats itself over and over again with each judge the word judge it doesn't mean that it's like a judge in a courtroom who uh like deciding different cases and interpreting the law the judge for the most part these are military leaders who rise up and conquer the enemy now this is as you read it on your own you'll see a couple times it says because there was no king in Israel Israel had never had a king before judges so you it goes judges is from Joshua it ends at uh josua begins Josh judges begins at Joshua and goes all the way to King about King Saul so this and King Saul was the very first king of Israel so judge judges spans that time again from Joshua all the way to King Saul the author I don't really know who wrote judges a lot of people think that it was the prophet Samuel because Samuel was there when when Saul was there and he would have been The Logical choice to have written this um Narrative of all these years but they really don't know who the author was the 12 judges mentioned in the book annel ahud shamgar Deborah Gideon toah J jeepa izan Elon abdden and the last one is Samson some other people say that actually um Samuel was the last judge but in the Book of Judges it ends at Samson some of them some of these judges like like shamgar they only have one or two sentences about them and then others like Gideon and Samson have a whole lot written about them um as I said the the author they don't know who really wrote that um chapters one and two in the Book of Judges they speak about Conquest God's still with the children of Israel in the first part of Judges it's because Joshua was fresh in their minds but the L mentioned this when he taught on the Book of Joshua that Joshua and those Elders that knew Joshua they kept serving the lord but it was when they passed away that Israel began to fall chapters 3- 16 talks about how the israels fall into sin and compromise with the world that surrounds them and then really chapters 17- 21 closing of the book are just very strange we talk about some very very odd stories and it looks like everything is just in pure chaos in Israel at that time very sinful sinful time that was going on and you'll see that this Book of Judges more than any other it is very graphic I mean violence and a lot of n nasty stuff going on um I'll try to give the uh I'll water it down a little bit but it's it's rough This Book of Judges is a it's a tough book to read the book opens with successes with the tribes settling into their inherited land remember Joshua divided up all the tribes um and and they they came to their land and as I said they were successful they were driving out these inhabitants um so then the judges really show this book shows how important good leadership is it shows that when you don't have good leadership that the children of Israel immediately went into sin and it's it's both it's leadership on the government level it's leadership in the church's level and it's leadership right in home and all of us can see all of us know people that their families have just really had trouble and a lot of times it's because of poor leadership at home we see our we see in our country right now we see the sin just being invited into our country and we see everything fails because of it and it's not just the morality that people we see the economy failing we see all kinds of big problems associated with it but we see poor leadership within within our country with all the way at at the top Judges chapter 1 we'll get into the into the text now judges 1 verse one now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord saying who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them and the Lord said Judah shall go up behold I have delivered the land into his hand now I know it's it seems very simple but notice they asked the Lord very very important they went to the Lord first they did what Joshua did they did what Moses did they did what these Elders did that had set this example is exactly what they did and they continued winning battles here in the Book of Judges but they made a big mistake as they were going out out God had instructed them to completely drive out the inhabitants of the land but they didn't completely do it and the problem was that Joshua had died and then the degradation of Israel began and as I said before it's because they didn't have that relationship with the Lord that they should have had and today what I was saying earlier is is if you right relying on the righteousness of brother brandom or your pastor your parents or anyone else rather than you receiving the Holy Spirit then the same thing is going to happen to you as happened in This Book of Judges that I'm about to read so let's go uh let's skip to verse 21 now watch this and it may seem kind of boring in reading this but it is super important to lay a foundation to the Book of Judges and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem under this day so those Canaanites were an influence and we like to think often we like to think that we are going to influence everybody else but in this case it was them that influenced God's people and the house of Joseph they also went up against bethl and the Lord was with them and the house of Joseph sent sent a describe sent to describe bethl now the name of the city before was L and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him show us we pray thee the entrance into the City and we will show thee mercy and when he showed them the entrance into the city they smote the city with at the edge of the sword now they again they won another battle but watch this but they let go the man and all his family and the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called the name thereof lse which is the name thereof unto this day neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethen and her towns nor tanac and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor and her towns nor the inhabitants of IAM and her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the Canaanites would dwell in that land it's important to the author here to tell us this and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to Tribute and did not utterly drive them out right here they could have driven them out but because they demanded that they would pay taxes sounds sounds like a good idea huh well we'll just we don't have the money so we'll let these people stay here because they have some money and we'll just demand that they pay tribute to us it sounds good and you think how could God want us to drive out these people this is their home how could God want us to drive them out of their home it was God's land no matter how much anybody says anything this was God's land he could give it to whoever he wanted and he gave it to the sons and the daughters of Abraham neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in gizer but the Canaanites dwelt in gizer among them neither did zebul drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the inhabitants of noo but the Canaanites dwell among them and became tributaries neither did did Asher Drive outs drive out the inhabitants of acho nor the inhabitants of zidon nor of Hal alab nor of um aib nor of helba nor of AIC nor of reob sorry I can I can't pronounce the names but you know what I'm saying you can read them for the L I should have had you just pronounce them but but the asheritah ites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out neither did Neftali drive out the inhabitants of Beth shamesh nor the inhabitants of bethan but he dwelt in the among the Canaanites I feel like when I'm talking I feel like I have a lift but I'm saying that it's hard to say nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth bees became Tri in um that that in Beth bethan became tributes unto them and the amorites forced the children of Dan I can say that one into the the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down into the into the valley so what did this Disobedience to God result in it made sense to the Israelites to do what they did but still God's word was God's word and he told them to drive them out chapter 2 verse one says this and an angel of the Lord came up from gilgal to boim and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and have brought you unto the land which I swear unto your fathers and said I will never break my commandment my Covenant with you and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this don't make a deal with them don't jump in with them don't partake of their sins do what I told you and drive them out but you didn't do that let's skip to verse 13 and what did it result in and they forsook the Lord and serve Baal and asero now this Baal and asteroth these are the gods of the inhabitants of Canaan and I want to point out again that this is still worship they thought that they were doing right they're not going to do something they don't think is right so they're still worshiping it's still religion even though it might seem like Idol idolatry to you and me to them it was real and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he delivered them into the hands of the spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies enemies whether soever they went out the hand of the Lord was against them for evil as the Lord had said and as the Lord had sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed nevertheless the Lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them and yet they would not hearken under their judges but they went a whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the Commandments of the Lord but they did not so and when the Lord raised them up judges then the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them remember what I said at the beginning we came out of the denominations and I truly feel like we have made a worse denomination and become more sectarian and more judgmental and more um elitist than the ones that came out and it came to pass I believe that's true I really do that we have slipped into the same thing that our grandparents came out of and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he said because that this people hath transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice I also will not henceforth drive out anymore before them of the Nations which Joshua left when he died that through them I may Pro prove Israel whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep or not therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua now chapters 3- 16 are stories about the growing corruption that is now in Israel and it just gets worse and worse and worse there's six main judges I said that there were 12 before but there's six main ones annel ahud Debra and Gideon jeepa and Samson this anneal we'll start with him and then I'll probably get through one more before we close but this anneal he was either a nephew of a brother sometimes it's hard to hard to understand in the Bible whether it's a what kind of relation it is but he was either a nephew of or a brother of Caleb and Israel's first judge after the spirit of the Lord came on him AEL freed the Israelites from this king kushen ratham who ruled over the region of Aram and part of Mesopotamia this man had oppressed the Israelites for eight years and after off and afterwards annel overpowered the forces and the Jews enjoyed peace for 40 years until AEL died so what happened was so these Israelites they got into their land and they didn't drive out these people that they should have driven out and then the oppressors they start to get more powerful these Canaanites and what they do is they come in and they take from the Israelites they take their food they take their gold and they oppress them it's the same as if you've studied some of the history of this part of the country the Apaches they would be up in the mountains and they would come down and they would raid the other Native Americans and take what they've done and that was part of the living that they would that they would make I'm not trying to take a side between any of these different tribes but that's history that's that's these raiding tribes would come in and take what these farmer tribes would have and that's that's the way it is a bit of a symbiotic relationship I guess that they would take and that's what was happening here is these Canaanites would come in and they would take from the Israelites God would raise up a judge to fight against them and he raised up this anneal to fight against these Canaanites and then for 40 years until annol died and then they started falling back into sin ahud is the second let's read uh 312 here and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord strengthened Egan the king of Moab against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord and He gathered unto him the children of Ammon and amalec and went and smote Israel and possessed the city of the of palm trees so the children of Israel served eglan the king of Moab 18 years years so God raises up this judge this man named ahud now eglan as I said was the king of Moab so this man ahood hope I don't get them mixed up mixed up Egan was the king I'll say the king and then ahud so ahud he raises up the spirit of the Lord comes on him and then what does he do he makes the sword it was 18 inches long you know how I know it was 18 inches long the Bible says it was 18 inches long it was a cubit and it had two edges and he makes it to where it will fit under his under his outside clothes on his right leg you know why he put it on his right leg because he was left-handed so he could go over here here and pull it out really easy you know how I know he was left-handed the Bible says he was left-handed it's really neat the detail that that is in This Book of Judges so he builds this knife he puts it in here and so he can he can pull it out when he needs it and then he goes and all of the people of Israel they give him the tribute money to bring to this King so ahud takes all the money I doubt very seriously that the children of Israel knew what he was going to do he takes all the money and he brings it and he gets an audience with this King so he takes it up there and and they're in the king's chamber and all of the guards and stuff are around and all the servants and um ahud says to Egon he says uh he says he looks at me he says hey I have a I have a private message for you has all this money so the king's like you have a private message for me he's like yeah yeah I got I have a private something I want to just tell you so he looks at all of his servants he say okay leave everybody leave everybody get out of my chamber all the guards leave all of the servants leave they go out and he's like shut the door shut the door they shut the door and ahood says I have a message from God for you and he says really and it has it gets his attention and then aood pulls out this dagger that he had made now Egan was a very fat man you know how I know he was a very fat man the Bible says he was a very fat man he pulls out this dagger and he uses it so uses it he sticks him with it and he goes in so far he can't get it out so then this this egin this guy is mortally wounded he dies so ahud he uses this chance he's like okay the king's here dying so he takes off he gets out of there and then what about the servants the servants are still outside and they're like man what is taking the king so long and they're too afraid to go in and check on the king and all the time that they're they're one wondering do we do we go in there do we not he's he's in there what's he doing in there the hero is escaping and running away so then they finally figure out the big king is dead and uh after that the Israelites attack this Moab and they overpower and they win the battle and again we had peace in Israel so that's the second judge I have I have time to go for at least one more so then the third judge is this guy named shamgar there's only like one sentence about him and in the whole Bible and it says that he took this Ox go and he killed like 600 Philistines you know what an ox codat is an ox is it's it's a it's a like a spear that has kind of a point on it that they can poke the oxes or has some sort of a tip on it and they can get them to go where they want them to go so this man shamgar takes that and kills all of of these Philistines and judges Israel one like one scripture about this but this shamgar was a uh he was a very special person he was a special person to me and probably to you because brother branam mentioned him in 16 different sermons that he preached one scripture about this man shamgar but brother brandom mentioned him 16 different in 16 different sermons and many many different times brother Bram says this about shamgar he says shamgar looked at him and thought Oh here he goes again he stood there and he thought well look down at his poor little wife her little sunken face and maybe his children remember I I said how these Canaanites would do they would take the all the food and stuff from the Israelites their little sleeves are ragged their clothes were gone his poor wife was starved to death what will the winner be this time there it is now all the year after year they've come and they they are here coming again and I'm just we just are about to Star we just about starved last year now they'll take what I got now what will I do just what gleanings I can get from the field he stood there he thought here here they come closer and closer Trump Trump trump these Philistines after a while There Was You don't believe in getting angry then let the righteous IND indignation arise he began to feel it coming upon him he said here I am a Jew I'm circumcised I've got a right for this land belongs to us and I tell you he wasn't a warrior he couldn't wait till he learned how to fight he was a farmer he wasn't a fighter but he knew that he had the promise of God was with him and he was circumcised And if every man here tonight would realize that the things you got Divine health and everything else God gave it to you at Calvary every born again man is circumcised by the Holy Ghost you have a right for every Redemptive blessing let the devil rob you out of none of it shamgar didn't have no sword he didn't know nothing about it if he had one he didn't have a shield but if he had a shield he wouldn't know how to use it but he reached up and got an ox go that's an old stick that's got a brass lump on the end of it and they beat the ox to the Corral with it he jumped out of that window out of the middle of the road against 600 armed Philistines and killed every one of them hallelujah what was it the Holy Spirit Come on him Hallelujah and then there was a need there was an emergency something had to be done and he couldn't wait till he got an education learn how to fight and be a warrior and trained up he had to take what was in his hand and go and do something with it and that was shamgar that judge the next one I have time for one more the next one was it's always been odd to me growing up was a woman the Bible says that she was a prophetess her name was Deborah now Deborah obviously had a gift she was born both a propheus and and she was made a judge which is she had she had leadership qualities in her and after the death of ahud again the Israelites did did evil in the sight of the Lord so God handed them over to jabin the king of Canaan with his Commander this man named cicer and an army of Chariots and they oppressed Israel for 20 years and and then Israel finally cried to the Lord for help so Deborah the prophet is she's she is encouraging the people she needs help is what she needs so she goes to this Warrior named baric and she asks him she says baric I want you to go up she she gives a prophecy and she says I want you to go up and fight this man CIS baric didn't maybe have the confidence that he should have had so he asks Deborah he says I won't go up unless you go with me now remember the separation of the Sexes here A man is called to be a man and a woman's called to be a woman Deborah even later on she says I was a mother in Israel when she sings this this Victory song well baric says I'm not going to go unless you go with me she says okay and then she prophesies remember she has the gift of of Prophecy upon her she says if I go then God is not going to give you this Victory he's going to give it to a woman wow so then they go so as I was reading this I was like oh it's going to be her she's going to win it so they go and they go to battle and baric beats this General cic and all of his chariots and everything else but ciser escapes and he goes around and he's in hiding so cisar comes to this woman named does anybody know the story what's her name jail right cisterra comes to this woman named jail and he says I'm really thirsty and you I'm running and I need some help and Jail's like sure I can help you here's some warm nice warm milk maybe it'll put you to sleep so CIS takes he takes the milk and oh thank you so much and he says here Hide me so he takes the milk and he drinks and he's so tired and he goes into the tent and he hides under the blanket and jail the little lady remember the prophecy of Deborah the little lady she goes remember he's in a tent you know what you hold down tents with you know the the the ropes that come down and there's a steak in the ground right you got it Kenneth and and you tighten that up and anyways she picked one of those Stakes as a sharp point on the end and she took the hammer he's sleeping after he took drank that nice warm milk that jail gave him she's laying down she takes the tent steak can I say it brother Jordan take takes the tent Stak gently lays it on the side of his head and he's asleep pow drove the stake right through the guy into the ground and killed him the prophecy of Deborah right there came to pass in that he gave God gave the cing God gave this General into the hands of a woman and then so Deborah she was that she was that judge but baric was the one that he took 10,000 soldiers and he's just slaughtered cis's Army and then after that there was peace another 40 years and uh if the musicians could come and we'll close and we'll pick this up at a later date we'll get to Gideon and we'll get to these other ones that also did these great things for the Lord that God chose these people p pulled them out of this sinful nation and really they delivered Israel these judges so in review we know that brother ly he preached on Joshua we know that God blessed all of Israel when they came over they drove out the inhabitants they they then Joshua died and then they stopped driving out all of them they were influenced by these worldly people they took on their worldly ways they took on their sinful ways God pulled his hand from them they fell into bondage they fell into sin they they they were oppressed then God would raise up a judge deliver them and then the cycle would repeat over and over again and that's the Book of Judges as I said it's it's um kind of a depressing book when you read it because it's just failure after failure it's great victories by these judges but then it's um it's really tough that we see that Israel had fallen so many times let's let's stand and friends when I'm talking about this I really do I mean it that these book these things aren't recorded in this Bible if we're not to apply them to our own lives and I feel that we shouldn't make the same mistakes that were made we don't have the excuses necessarily that they have because we can read about their mistakes God bless you brother [Music] Aon oh life is EAS when you're up on a mountain and you've got peace of like you've never know but things when you're down in the [Applause] valley don't use Fai

and as I said interesting and and how God would use these different these different Warriors and heroes to save the people even though they forsook him every time and I'd like to say how many times have I forsaken the Lord and yet that longsuffering of God he's always welcomed me back with open arms just as he did these children of Israel I appreciate his patience with with all of these people in the book and especially with all of us so friends as we go forward and we think about this Book of Judges just remember that it's human nature to fall right back into the sin that we've come out of let's not do it let's put Christ first let's do what the prophet said continue to move on with our lives and get closer to our lord Jesus again please pray and and prepare for communion service this Sunday it's a very very important thing we never want to come and stand at this altar unworthily we want to make sure that we've done everything that we can to be right with the Lord right with each
