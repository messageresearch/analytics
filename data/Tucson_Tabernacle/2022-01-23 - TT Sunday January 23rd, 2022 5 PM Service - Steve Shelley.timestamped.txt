[38:50] to do that tonight
[38:52] all i can do is give what i have to him
[38:55] and ask him to help us
[38:57] would you turn in your bible to isaiah
[39:00] 40
[39:01] and i want to thank you for coming this
[39:03] evening
[39:04] thank brother aaron for the invitation
[39:07] to be here today and
[39:09] it's an honor to be here and the
[39:11] presence of the lord was with us
[39:15] we had some
[39:16] texts come in
[39:18] those who were streaming i wasn't even
[39:20] aware that they were streaming
[39:23] and they were blessed in the service
[39:24] today and
[39:26] sometimes we forget about those who we
[39:28] can't see
[39:30] but they're they're with us
[39:32] and they have needs
[39:34] and they're saying virtual amens
[39:37] we can't hear them maybe feel them
[39:39] but we're one body tonight whether we
[39:42] could be here in person or not
[39:44] we're part of this great body of christ
[39:47] we pray for the seniors my heart
[39:50] is for those who are unable to be here
[39:53] who are fighting
[39:54] sickness
[39:56] maybe
[39:57] also the enemy puts a little fear and
[40:00] they have to press through that
[40:02] my heart goes out to people
[40:04] because they would so love to be with us
[40:06] this evening so let's ask the lord to go
[40:09] right out to them and touch them where
[40:11] they are amen
[40:14] isaiah 40.
[40:16] beginning in verse 28
[40:20] the scripture said hast thou not known
[40:23] hast thou not heard
[40:25] that the everlasting god the lord
[40:30] the creator of the ends of the earth
[40:33] fainteth not
[40:35] neither
[40:39] neither is weary
[40:42] there is no searching
[40:45] of his understanding
[40:48] he giveth power to the faint
[40:53] and to them
[40:54] that have no might
[40:56] he
[40:58] increaseth strength
[41:01] even the youths
[41:03] shall faint
[41:04] and be weary
[41:06] and the young men
[41:08] shall utterly fall
[41:11] but
[41:13] they
[41:14] that wait upon the lord
[41:18] shall renew
[41:20] their strength
[41:23] they shall mount up
[41:25] with wings as the eagles
[41:30] they shall run and not be weary
[41:34] they shall walk
[41:37] and
[41:38] not
[41:39] faint
[41:40] how many of you appreciate the word of
[41:43] the lord
[41:44] tonight
[41:45] i want to read just emphasize just a
[41:48] moment
[41:49] a couple of places a couple of phrases
[41:52] before we see
[41:53] have our seats
[41:56] i love this description that isaiah
[42:00] he's asking a question
[42:02] and he said the creator
[42:05] of the ends of the earth fainteth not
[42:10] neither
[42:11] is
[42:12] weary
[42:14] i want you to know tonight that's the
[42:15] god we serve
[42:17] he's not weary
[42:19] he's not powerless he's not giving up on
[42:22] us
[42:24] he remains ever more strong and mighty
[42:28] then i notice here it says even the
[42:30] youths shall faint and be weary and
[42:33] young men utterly fall but they
[42:36] that wait upon the lord
[42:39] shall renew
[42:41] their
[42:42] strength
[42:44] mount up with wings as the eagles
[42:47] shall run and not be weary and they
[42:50] shall walk
[42:51] and not faint
[42:53] let's pray together for just a moment
[42:56] lord jesus
[42:58] we need you tonight
[43:02] we need your help
[43:04] we need your touch
[43:06] we need your presence
[43:09] we need the anointing
[43:12] that destroys
[43:15] every yoke
[43:17] that sets
[43:18] every captive free
[43:21] we need help tonight
[43:24] to keep pressing in
[43:26] and pressing on
[43:28] in this good fight of faith
[43:30] i asked lord tonight that you would
[43:32] touch this throat this voice of mine
[43:36] that you would clear my voice
[43:39] that you would give it strength
[43:41] so that i might minister to this
[43:44] your people
[43:46] bought with a price
[43:49] redeemed by the blood of the lamb
[43:52] they neither belong to this church nor
[43:54] to any minister
[43:56] they are the sheep of your pasture
[43:59] and you've laid everything down on their
[44:02] behalf
[44:03] and i ask you tonight to walk the aisles
[44:07] of this house
[44:08] and minister who you are
[44:11] in a supernatural way
[44:14] jesus christ the same
[44:17] yesterday and today and forever
[44:20] anoint our hearts to receive your word
[44:23] and remind us o god that you have called
[44:27] us
[44:28] to live
[44:29] above
[44:30] every circumstance
[44:32] of life
[44:34] and you have made the way possible for
[44:37] us to get up above it all
[44:39] and we thank you for that
[44:42] in the matchless name of the lord jesus
[44:45] christ we pray
[44:46] and the saints said
[44:49] you may be seated this evening
[44:56] for a moment
[44:57] or two this evening i want to
[45:00] minister
[45:01] about
[45:02] soaring above it all
[45:06] and you know what the prophet has taught
[45:09] us concerning
[45:11] those four living creatures
[45:14] that constantly stand in the presence of
[45:17] god
[45:18] giving him praise
[45:20] and when we read their description
[45:23] we find out that we're looking at
[45:27] a beast we're looking at a man
[45:30] we're looking at an eagle
[45:33] but there is
[45:35] not a description
[45:37] or an action that is attached to
[45:41] all of the four creatures
[45:44] when john got down to the last the one
[45:47] that is most significant in our age
[45:51] he said he had the appearance
[45:54] of a flying eagle
[45:57] now notice it wasn't a a
[46:00] beast a burden-bearing beast brother
[46:04] branham explains that that's what the
[46:06] beast represented
[46:07] it it didn't say a walking talking man
[46:11] it didn't say a roaring lion or some
[46:14] other description of a beast or an
[46:16] animal but when it come to the end
[46:19] he said he has the appearance of a
[46:22] flying eagle
[46:24] so in my mind's eye i see the eagle but
[46:27] he's not perched on a limb somewhere
[46:30] looking surveying at all
[46:33] but when i have an image of a flying
[46:36] eagle i see one that has caught the wind
[46:40] he's no longer pecking around in a
[46:43] valley he's not perched in a tree
[46:46] somewhere but he's taken to the sky
[46:49] and from where he is
[46:51] he sees things a whole lot differently
[46:54] than he would if he were walking around
[46:58] here on the earth
[46:59] that's the anointing the overcoming
[47:02] anointing
[47:03] that was attached to the age that we
[47:06] live in the anointing of a flying eagle
[47:10] and i want you to know that if you and i
[47:13] will allow the spirit of the lord his
[47:16] word will catch us up to a higher place
[47:20] above our problems
[47:23] come on above our aches
[47:25] and our pains and our symptoms above our
[47:30] situations that tend to weigh us down
[47:34] and cause us to be earthbound but
[47:37] brother aaron we were not created to be
[47:40] earthbound to be tethered to the trials
[47:44] of life
[47:45] god has ordained a way for you and i to
[47:48] be caught up above
[47:50] everything that's going on around us and
[47:53] see things from heaven's point of view
[47:57] for me it's the only way to overcome if
[48:00] i'm only looking at what i can see from
[48:03] earth's vantage point it looks bigger
[48:07] than it really is and sometimes it looks
[48:10] impossible but when i can get up a
[48:13] little bit higher when i start feasting
[48:17] on the living word of god it catches me
[48:20] up it causes me to want to spread my
[48:23] wings just a little bit and not just sit
[48:27] perched in a tree somewhere but it
[48:29] causes me to want to get a little higher
[48:32] and experience all
[48:35] that he has for us even in this dark
[48:38] hour
[48:39] and we mentioned this morning that
[48:41] there's darkness everywhere and it's
[48:44] increasing in the world out there but
[48:47] it's supposed to be getting brighter
[48:52] help me just a little bit
[48:55] we know that it's prophesied
[48:58] that it will become
[49:00] closer and closer to total insanity out
[49:04] there
[49:05] but they're supposed to be light in here
[49:08] when we come together with other
[49:10] believers we're not focusing on what's
[49:13] going on out there we're catching
[49:15] another wave
[49:17] we're catching another burst of wind by
[49:20] the spirit of god that says come on up
[49:23] just a little bit higher i've got a new
[49:26] thought for you i have a new perspective
[49:29] for you
[49:30] how many of you know that you can for
[49:33] instance what i like i like a lot of
[49:35] things about tucson
[49:37] i don't want to offend you there's a few
[49:39] things i don't like but i like a lot
[49:41] about it
[49:42] one i like the fact that there are very
[49:46] few high buildings
[49:50] i like to be on one side of the city
[49:52] and see clean to the other side
[49:56] without a skyscraper in my way
[49:59] so i appreciate that about this city but
[50:02] i've been in cities
[50:03] where the buildings are so tall
[50:06] you're standing at them you can hardly
[50:09] see the top but when you get in the
[50:11] airplane
[50:13] and that airplane begins to take you
[50:16] 30 000 feet or more on a cloudless day
[50:19] and you can look down and see downtown
[50:22] atlanta or downtown dallas or wherever
[50:26] you might be what looked so huge when
[50:30] you were standing at the foot of it
[50:31] looking up
[50:33] looks like a little lego block that i
[50:36] step on used to step on so much when the
[50:39] kids were little
[50:40] tiny little building block is all it
[50:42] looks like and now that building size
[50:45] hasn't changed
[50:47] same building
[50:49] same dimensions
[50:51] same size but your perspective
[50:55] your vantage point has changed i want to
[50:59] tell you what looks so bad
[51:02] right now if you and i can allow the
[51:04] word to catch us into a higher place
[51:08] with an anointing of a flying eagle
[51:11] because that's how the message came to
[51:13] us and it came to us in that way so that
[51:16] we could also be lifted up to another
[51:19] vantage point and begin to see things
[51:22] from heaven's point of view and realize
[51:25] that mountains become mole hills
[51:31] insurmountable obstacles
[51:34] become tiny little fences
[51:37] that we can just seemingly step over
[51:40] when we change our perspective when we
[51:43] allow the holy spirit to cause us to be
[51:46] what we were created to be and by the
[51:48] way that wasn't a chicken in the
[51:49] barnyard it wasn't a buzzard somewhere
[51:52] in the far but you and i are eagles
[51:55] brother branham said we are spiritual
[51:58] astronauts
[52:00] and we were created to be higher than
[52:04] what we are right now
[52:06] and we have to allow the holy spirit to
[52:09] catch us
[52:10] to pull us
[52:11] into a spiritual dimension
[52:14] that changes
[52:16] our perspective and the way that we look
[52:18] at things that we're going through
[52:20] right now how many of you understand
[52:23] it's a simple thought but i have to be
[52:25] reminded of it quite often
[52:28] in a message
[52:30] whoa
[52:33] be right back
[52:39] in the message putting on the whole
[52:41] armor of god
[52:43] because we mentioned that this morning
[52:46] in 1962
[52:49] brother branham said in paragraph 82
[52:52] the chief
[52:53] the chief
[52:55] is leading
[52:56] us home
[52:58] he said come on home in my father's
[53:01] house are many mansions
[53:04] if it wasn't so
[53:06] i'd have told you
[53:08] i'll not leave you comfortless he's
[53:11] quoting the scripture
[53:13] i'll come again and be with you even in
[53:15] you to the end of the world
[53:18] the works that i do
[53:19] shall you do also
[53:21] a little while and the world seeth me no
[53:24] more yet ye shall see me for i will be
[53:27] with you even in you to the end of the
[53:30] world chief
[53:32] leading on
[53:34] amen now listen to what he says
[53:37] my lord knows the way
[53:40] through the wilderness
[53:42] all i have to do is what
[53:45] follow
[53:46] he knows the way
[53:48] you're passing through territory that
[53:51] you've never been through before but the
[53:53] lord knows the way
[53:55] without your spiritual eyes being open
[53:58] you can't see five minutes into the
[54:00] future but god's already been there
[54:03] he's timeless
[54:05] he's not bound by time
[54:07] he's eternal he's already been in your
[54:10] future he already knows what's just
[54:13] ahead of you and he's leading the way
[54:16] and all you and i have to do is follow
[54:18] behind him
[54:19] brother branham said all i have to do is
[54:21] follow amen
[54:22] he said hear the
[54:26] tramping of the army
[54:28] marching on to victory
[54:31] not paying any attention to all the
[54:35] unbelief and the old crows and the
[54:38] buzzards that are hollering around here
[54:41] we're eagles he said
[54:44] hallelujah we're eagles let's soar
[54:48] out of
[54:50] everything
[54:52] amen
[54:54] now this was his perspective
[54:56] we were not created to be caught up in
[55:00] everything that's going on around us
[55:02] we were created to be caught up into
[55:05] higher realm
[55:06] and he built those eagles naturally in
[55:10] the same manner just like you and i are
[55:12] built that way spiritually did you know
[55:15] an eagle can soar
[55:17] up to
[55:18] 15 thousand feet
[55:20] in a burst
[55:22] consistently an eagle can fly ten
[55:25] thousand feet but he has the ability to
[55:28] burst into fifteen thousand
[55:32] feet now that's about half the height of
[55:34] a jet flying above our heads
[55:37] and we find that no other bird
[55:40] can fly quite as high as the eagle
[55:44] he's specially built for the heights i
[55:47] want to tell you little bride you are
[55:49] specially built
[55:51] for the heights
[55:52] to get up above
[55:55] it all
[55:56] the eagle has a seven up to a seven foot
[55:59] wingspan
[56:00] and those wings enable him to glide and
[56:05] he does it with very little energy
[56:08] he doesn't have to flap those wings
[56:11] did you know the eagle doesn't have to
[56:13] use a lot of energy by flapping his
[56:16] wings
[56:17] he has five primary feathers
[56:20] on the tips of both of his wings and he
[56:24] literally has the ability
[56:26] to circle those feathers
[56:29] to rotate them just like this he doesn't
[56:32] have to flap that big seven foot
[56:34] wingspan he just takes the tips of his
[56:38] feathers on his wings and he begins to
[56:41] rotate them like that in a uh in a
[56:44] circular motion
[56:46] and those who study eagle say
[56:49] that it creates a centrifugal force
[56:53] that pushes the eagle higher and higher
[56:57] into the sky
[56:59] not only that it creates a centrifugal
[57:02] force that flows from his chest all the
[57:06] way back to his tail feather and that's
[57:09] how a mother eagle or a father eagle is
[57:12] able to draw its little ones
[57:14] up to itself when they're kicked out of
[57:17] the nest when they're training for
[57:20] flight and they get a little far away
[57:23] from mama or papa that eagle will just
[57:26] fly above them
[57:28] not not not adam
[57:30] just above them
[57:32] almost suspend itself
[57:35] in midair and will do nothing but
[57:38] circulate those little feathers in
[57:40] hebrew that's
[57:41] nasha the word is nasha in hebrew and it
[57:45] means to to pull up
[57:48] under one's bosom
[57:50] that little eagle will just circulate
[57:52] those feathers and that little baby
[57:55] eaglet that's gotten too far away from
[57:57] mama and daddy and the flying lessons
[58:00] the force
[58:02] of that energy will cause that little
[58:04] baby to be sucked right up under the
[58:07] breast of that mother or that father i
[58:10] want you to know you have a papa eagle
[58:13] i want you to remember tonight that your
[58:16] papa eagle is flying above you when you
[58:20] get a little too far away for comfort
[58:23] all he has to do is just rotate those
[58:26] little feathers and pull us hallelujah
[58:29] right back up under him the bible tells
[58:33] us in in the writings of the zombies
[58:35] underneath
[58:37] are the everlasting arms
[58:40] he has the ability to just pull us right
[58:42] up i love the fact that the eagle
[58:45] doesn't have to use a lot of energy he
[58:47] just sets his wings
[58:49] and he's built and designed so
[58:51] aerodynamically
[58:53] that he just catches the wind
[58:55] and any any any breeze
[58:58] that blows he can just set his wings
[59:01] it's like tightening your elbows like
[59:04] this he just sets his wing and the wind
[59:07] does the work i want you to know you
[59:10] can't depend on your own strength to get
[59:12] up above what you're going through right
[59:14] now but papa has provided a way if
[59:18] you'll just set your wings and put your
[59:21] trust in him the holy spirit of god will
[59:24] lift you up above it give you a
[59:27] different perspective help you i know
[59:29] he'll help us to soar above whatever it
[59:33] is that the enemy is trying to use to
[59:36] destroy us
[59:37] do you believe that
[59:39] in the countdown
[59:41] paragraph 76
[59:44] brother branham says the spiritual
[59:46] astronaut
[59:48] is eagles
[59:50] he goes beyond
[59:52] all denominational creeds
[59:55] all in all
[1:00:01] all denominational barriers
[1:00:04] all
[1:00:06] all denominational thinkings
[1:00:10] all their cloudy thoughts
[1:00:12] he gets above every cloud
[1:00:15] everything there is to look at he's
[1:00:17] around he's up
[1:00:19] around the stars
[1:00:21] the astronaut
[1:00:22] and the astronaut believer is also up in
[1:00:26] the heavenlies he's far
[1:00:29] beyond these earth-bound things
[1:00:33] lord lift us tonight
[1:00:37] we get weary with the news
[1:00:39] we get weary with the covid
[1:00:42] we get weary with the politics around us
[1:00:46] we get weary with seeing our children in
[1:00:48] trouble
[1:00:49] lord will you just lift us up
[1:00:52] into a higher place he said he's far
[1:00:54] beyond these earthbound things he's up
[1:00:58] high he's in outer space he's talking
[1:01:00] about you and i he's talking about the
[1:01:02] spiritual astronaut he said see the
[1:01:05] earthly man doesn't know very much about
[1:01:08] outer space but if the astronauts in
[1:01:11] outer space he's there with it
[1:01:15] he knows more about what's going on
[1:01:17] above than he does what's going on down
[1:01:20] here i advise you tonight to spend more
[1:01:23] time
[1:01:24] investigating this great truth than
[1:01:27] being carried away with everybody's blog
[1:01:30] post
[1:01:31] and everybody's podcast come on now
[1:01:34] i encourage you to bury yourself in this
[1:01:38] word and see if it won't lift you above
[1:01:41] what you're fighting right now
[1:01:43] he'll come in the truck
[1:01:46] he'll come in the home
[1:01:48] he'll come wherever we listen to this
[1:01:51] lifting word that god has sent and he'll
[1:01:54] try to catch us up a little bit higher
[1:01:56] if we'll go with him how many of you'd
[1:01:58] like to just set your wings
[1:02:00] and get up above some of this stuff
[1:02:03] god knows we need to do that
[1:02:06] now in the message countdown
[1:02:08] same message different city
[1:02:11] paragraph 81
[1:02:14] we just read from shreveport and this is
[1:02:17] from jeffersonville he said god
[1:02:20] i hope you'll stay with me because
[1:02:22] before i'm done i want to share
[1:02:24] something else
[1:02:25] god wants man
[1:02:27] who can come into christ
[1:02:30] and believe that he's the same yesterday
[1:02:34] today and forever
[1:02:36] and don't take their own thinking
[1:02:40] but move on out into space
[1:02:43] controlled by
[1:02:45] the holy ghost
[1:02:47] i'm quoting
[1:02:49] i'm not making this up
[1:02:51] controlled by the holy ghost he said
[1:02:53] amen astronauts
[1:02:56] phew
[1:02:57] how far it is back from the old horse
[1:03:00] and buggy
[1:03:01] how far it is even from the airplane
[1:03:04] how far it is from justification
[1:03:06] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:09] they're coming to eagles
[1:03:12] now listen to this
[1:03:14] first they were lizards
[1:03:20] then they become chickens
[1:03:23] then they become crows
[1:03:26] this is strange talk
[1:03:29] now they're eagles
[1:03:33] you'll hear brother branham saying in
[1:03:34] most places
[1:03:37] once an eagle always an eagle
[1:03:39] he's not describing who you are
[1:03:42] he's describing our behavior along the
[1:03:44] way
[1:03:45] and how many of you know we were always
[1:03:47] eagles
[1:03:48] elected before we got to this earth
[1:03:50] chosen to get above it all in the end
[1:03:52] time every bit of that in god's great
[1:03:55] foreknowledge no doubt about it but we
[1:03:58] didn't always live like eagles
[1:04:01] hello we don't always live like eagles
[1:04:03] tonight
[1:04:04] but we are
[1:04:06] sometimes we crawl around like lizards
[1:04:10] sometimes we peck around like chickens
[1:04:13] sometimes we flock around like crows and
[1:04:17] other times we recognize who we are
[1:04:20] and we allow the spirit of god to lift
[1:04:23] us into a higher place of revelation and
[1:04:26] truth
[1:04:27] he goes on to say
[1:04:29] an eagle is a special bird
[1:04:32] he can go higher than any other bird
[1:04:34] he's prepared to see
[1:04:37] to keep his head level
[1:04:39] when he gets up there
[1:04:40] there's some people can jump way up and
[1:04:43] don't know where they're at after they
[1:04:44] get there
[1:04:46] because they can't see no farther than
[1:04:48] what he's jumped but there's some that
[1:04:50] can look back and see what's going on
[1:04:53] that's the eagle
[1:04:55] maybe i just need to remind you tonight
[1:04:57] that brother adam didn't just type the
[1:04:59] prophet to the eagle he typed the
[1:05:01] prophetic believer to the eagle to the
[1:05:04] one that follows the prophetic word you
[1:05:07] are also an eagle
[1:05:10] he can stand there
[1:05:11] till he looks it over and waits till he
[1:05:14] hears a message that tells him what to
[1:05:17] do what to say
[1:05:18] that's the astronaut of god do you
[1:05:21] remember brother branham saying the
[1:05:23] bride will have thus saith the lord or
[1:05:26] she will keep still
[1:05:28] come on now
[1:05:30] you and i can hear a word from him
[1:05:33] we can be listening to a tape and god's
[1:05:36] voice ring out in such a profound way
[1:05:40] that you wonder if he was just talking
[1:05:42] directly to you he was
[1:05:45] because you were born to hear that word
[1:05:48] it's for us
[1:05:51] it's to lift us up
[1:05:53] to get us above some of the junk that
[1:05:56] goes on in our lives
[1:05:59] you know an eagle
[1:06:00] he doesn't build his nest low to the
[1:06:02] ground
[1:06:04] he always makes sure
[1:06:07] that he builds his nest above the snake
[1:06:10] line
[1:06:12] you see there's a place out in the
[1:06:14] canyons
[1:06:15] that the snake won't go any higher
[1:06:19] he'll crawl and crawl and crawl he'll
[1:06:21] climb a tree they'll do all kinds of
[1:06:23] things
[1:06:24] but there is a height
[1:06:26] that you won't find any serpent
[1:06:29] able to
[1:06:31] crawl into that space
[1:06:33] now i don't know if it's some particular
[1:06:36] number or if it's just some sense or
[1:06:38] something
[1:06:39] but i know that there is a place where
[1:06:42] the snake won't go
[1:06:43] and an eagle with their intuition
[1:06:46] they'll never build their nest down in
[1:06:49] that snake line they always want to try
[1:06:52] to find a place that's higher than where
[1:06:55] the serpent crawls that's a safe place
[1:06:58] how many of you believe we've got a safe
[1:07:00] place
[1:07:01] far above
[1:07:03] the snake line
[1:07:05] now eagles are hunters
[1:07:09] they've got razor sharp talons and claws
[1:07:13] and they're curved
[1:07:15] razor-sharp and they can catch the prey
[1:07:19] and those long talons can inflict
[1:07:22] serious wounds
[1:07:24] in battle
[1:07:25] because sometimes there's a war going on
[1:07:29] and the eagle has to use those sharp
[1:07:31] talons
[1:07:33] to take out his enemy
[1:07:35] you and i have an enemy
[1:07:37] and we have the weapon that we need to
[1:07:39] defeat that enemy
[1:07:41] if you believe that same man
[1:07:43] all right
[1:07:44] and there's so many things
[1:07:47] that we can say about this eagle the
[1:07:49] easter seal
[1:07:51] paragraph 186 phoenix
[1:07:54] brother branham said but in the last
[1:07:56] message that went forth
[1:07:58] there come a flying eagle
[1:08:00] it's eagle time
[1:08:03] reveal time
[1:08:05] the word of god
[1:08:06] man made manifest the word of god
[1:08:10] proved
[1:08:12] in the fourth seal just bear with me
[1:08:15] in the fourth seal he said but in the
[1:08:17] eagle age paragraph 120
[1:08:20] he said but in the eagle age the last
[1:08:21] stage the prophetic age where there is
[1:08:24] to rise prophetic utterance see
[1:08:27] to whom the secrets always come
[1:08:31] he describes in this paragraph
[1:08:34] the the appetite of the eagle
[1:08:37] and that eagle won't eat just anything
[1:08:40] he's looking for a particular kind of
[1:08:44] diet
[1:08:45] and we know that and it's the revealed
[1:08:47] word of the hour
[1:08:48] and you can say amen
[1:08:51] and then the eagle vision
[1:08:54] is eyesight
[1:08:56] it's unmatched
[1:08:58] in the world of birds
[1:09:01] eight times sharper
[1:09:03] than that of humans
[1:09:06] it contains many more color sensitive
[1:09:09] cones
[1:09:11] and that's in the eye
[1:09:13] a a human eye
[1:09:16] has between
[1:09:17] 147
[1:09:21] and
[1:09:22] 181 000
[1:09:24] of these cones
[1:09:26] in the eye it's like pixels
[1:09:30] on a computer screen
[1:09:32] so a human eye
[1:09:34] 147 147 000
[1:09:37] to 181 000
[1:09:40] and if someone has perfect vision it can
[1:09:43] go all the way up to 281 thousand but an
[1:09:46] eagle has one million cones
[1:09:51] in the weaker
[1:09:52] of its two eyes
[1:09:55] god so
[1:09:57] created that eagle
[1:09:59] that he even placed his eye on the side
[1:10:02] of his head
[1:10:04] so that it extends his peripheral vision
[1:10:09] in a in an amazing way
[1:10:12] the eyes of an eagle are specifically
[1:10:14] designed for long distance focus
[1:10:17] with absolute clarity
[1:10:20] the eagle eye is one of the strongest in
[1:10:23] the entire animal kingdom
[1:10:25] four to eight times stronger than that
[1:10:28] of an average human
[1:10:31] an eagle is able to spot a rabbit
[1:10:35] two miles away
[1:10:38] now that's pretty good isn't it
[1:10:40] their eyes are stated to be larger in
[1:10:44] size than their brain
[1:10:47] by weight
[1:10:48] so a divine creator when he was building
[1:10:52] that eagle
[1:10:53] he created his eyes in a super fashion
[1:10:57] because the scripture was going to use
[1:11:00] that eagle and the message of the hour
[1:11:03] was going to use that eagle in type with
[1:11:06] a spiritual overcoming believer
[1:11:09] i like that
[1:11:11] i like that a lot
[1:11:13] but that's not what i want to share
[1:11:18] that was part one
[1:11:20] and i'm struggling a bit to get this out
[1:11:22] with my voice
[1:11:24] but it's coming it's coming
[1:11:28] but the scripture said
[1:11:31] they that wait
[1:11:34] upon the lord
[1:11:36] shall renew
[1:11:38] their strength
[1:11:41] they shall mount up with wings
[1:11:44] as eagles
[1:11:46] there is a behavior some of you know
[1:11:48] this well
[1:11:50] there is an observed behavior
[1:11:54] in certain varieties of eagles
[1:11:58] that have baffled scientists
[1:12:01] for many many years
[1:12:04] it's a period
[1:12:06] of time in an eagle's life
[1:12:10] when he goes so weary
[1:12:13] and so tired
[1:12:15] he becomes so weighted down
[1:12:19] with a body that
[1:12:20] is no longer functioning as it was
[1:12:23] created to function
[1:12:26] some scientists have called it a molting
[1:12:29] period
[1:12:30] because there are other birds who go
[1:12:33] through something similar but ancient
[1:12:37] writers
[1:12:38] didn't call it a molting period
[1:12:41] they called it a moping
[1:12:44] period
[1:12:45] moping
[1:12:46] anybody get it
[1:12:48] have you ever known any moping eagles
[1:12:54] you may be sitting on a pew
[1:12:57] with someone who has gotten weary
[1:13:01] and tired
[1:13:02] and worn out in this life
[1:13:05] they haven't given up on jesus
[1:13:08] they're just a little burned out
[1:13:10] hello
[1:13:12] you know even church
[1:13:15] oh
[1:13:18] even church can
[1:13:19] burn us out sometime
[1:13:24] you got to do the helping now
[1:13:27] it can wear us out same old same old
[1:13:31] same old
[1:13:33] i'm going to come down there and see you
[1:13:34] closer in a minute if you don't help me
[1:13:38] routine
[1:13:40] ritual
[1:13:41] we sing the same songs
[1:13:44] thousands of glorious songs
[1:13:49] and we sing the same ones
[1:13:52] because we think that
[1:13:54] there were no other songwriters
[1:13:56] after 65
[1:13:59] nobody could catch any inspiration
[1:14:01] you better listen to what i'm saying
[1:14:04] god didn't stop giving inspiration
[1:14:07] for songs
[1:14:09] when brother branham left the scene
[1:14:11] he wasn't a songwriter
[1:14:14] now i love the old songs i can feel you
[1:14:17] i feel you
[1:14:19] i love the old songs
[1:14:21] i love the old hymns
[1:14:24] more than life
[1:14:26] i love those words because they bring
[1:14:29] conviction
[1:14:31] and they bring the gospel
[1:14:33] and they're not experience based
[1:14:37] they're word-based
[1:14:39] but it wouldn't hurt us
[1:14:43] every now and again
[1:14:47] i hope you agree because you were i
[1:14:49] noticed this morning you you picked up a
[1:14:51] few that aren't from the 1950s
[1:14:56] you see sometimes we need something
[1:15:00] that'll just mix it up a little bit
[1:15:04] so that we don't raise our hands at the
[1:15:06] same time in every we come to that
[1:15:09] phrase we know exactly what we're going
[1:15:11] to do we become automatic robotic
[1:15:13] creatures
[1:15:15] worship was never supposed to be that
[1:15:17] way
[1:15:18] it's supposed to be instant it's
[1:15:20] supposed to be spontaneous it's supposed
[1:15:22] to be inspired
[1:15:24] it's supposed to be anointed i want you
[1:15:27] to know the worship and creating an
[1:15:30] atmosphere for the word to go forth is
[1:15:34] one of the most important things that
[1:15:36] you and i can do to enter in to a
[1:15:39] service
[1:15:40] by singing
[1:15:43] the best that we can
[1:15:45] if it's a song you've sung all your life
[1:15:48] forget about it and sing it as though
[1:15:51] you have never
[1:15:52] sung it before when you come into this
[1:15:55] house because there's somebody here to
[1:15:58] bring a message that you and i are going
[1:16:00] to need and brother branham tells us
[1:16:03] that the
[1:16:04] atmosphere is very very important
[1:16:10] all right
[1:16:11] that's why i believe harmony was so
[1:16:13] beautiful
[1:16:14] and so successful this year
[1:16:17] because
[1:16:18] we brought it home so to speak
[1:16:20] brother bobby
[1:16:22] it was a sacred atmosphere
[1:16:25] maybe it took us a few minutes to
[1:16:28] to get used to how things would be
[1:16:31] because there's no curtain to go behind
[1:16:33] and there was no hall lining up and and
[1:16:36] it was just different but i loved it
[1:16:38] from the start
[1:16:40] all the way to the finish and i grieved
[1:16:43] the next morning i did
[1:16:45] i woke up monday morning grieved because
[1:16:48] we couldn't come and do it all again
[1:16:50] monday night
[1:16:51] what made it so special
[1:16:54] familiar songs and
[1:16:56] beautiful things that we've heard in the
[1:16:58] past
[1:16:59] over at the hotel but the atmosphere was
[1:17:03] so conducive to worship
[1:17:05] that i i
[1:17:07] had no idea i'd be worshiping up here i
[1:17:10] thought i'd be worshiping back there
[1:17:12] somewhere but i couldn't contain myself
[1:17:15] because such an atmosphere was created
[1:17:18] as we begin to sing the songs of zion
[1:17:21] don't get in a rut
[1:17:26] come on moping eagles
[1:17:28] we're almost home
[1:17:31] the fight of the good fight of faith is
[1:17:34] being fought
[1:17:35] we're closer home
[1:17:37] than we've ever been before
[1:17:39] we can't stay down in the mulley grubs
[1:17:42] in this hour we've got to pull ourselves
[1:17:45] up out of that place of moping
[1:17:48] and grieving
[1:17:51] we cannot grieve for what was
[1:17:54] we have to reach forward and embrace
[1:17:57] what god has for us
[1:17:59] in this new hour
[1:18:02] we can't go back
[1:18:04] we can't go back you're never ever ever
[1:18:07] going to have a a pastor like
[1:18:10] brother green
[1:18:12] because they don't they don't build them
[1:18:15] that way
[1:18:16] anymore
[1:18:17] he was one of a kind
[1:18:20] oh my
[1:18:22] i'm like you
[1:18:24] i find myself so often
[1:18:27] i wished i would have asked brother
[1:18:29] greene about that
[1:18:30] i wished i would have had another
[1:18:32] conversation with him about that
[1:18:35] i know you feel the same way don't you
[1:18:38] and we i grieve still and when we come
[1:18:40] here we see him and we think about him
[1:18:42] and so forth but i want you to know the
[1:18:45] enemy would like to lock us in a box
[1:18:48] and we cannot be boxed in in this hour
[1:18:52] because we've got somewhere to go and
[1:18:55] it's higher
[1:18:56] yes we were ordained to get up above the
[1:19:00] depression of life
[1:19:03] and the circumstances of life
[1:19:06] let me read this before i offend you
[1:19:11] this was this was a commentator his name
[1:19:13] was clark
[1:19:15] and i'm reading him because he quoted
[1:19:18] some ancient writers
[1:19:22] he said in verse 31 they shall mount up
[1:19:24] with wings as eagles
[1:19:26] he said this should
[1:19:28] could also have been translated
[1:19:32] they shall put forth fresh
[1:19:35] feathers
[1:19:37] like the molting
[1:19:40] eagle
[1:19:42] let me spell that m-o-u-l-t-i-n-g
[1:19:48] molting
[1:19:49] eagle
[1:19:51] he said
[1:19:52] it's been a common and popular opinion
[1:19:54] that the eagle lives
[1:19:57] live excuse me that the eagle lives and
[1:19:59] retains his vigor to a great age
[1:20:03] and that beyond the common lot of other
[1:20:06] birds
[1:20:07] as he gets older he molts
[1:20:10] in his old age
[1:20:13] it's a sad time in an eagle's life
[1:20:17] he goes through a lot of things
[1:20:19] but it ends well
[1:20:22] because in the end his feathers
[1:20:26] are renewed
[1:20:27] his ability to fly
[1:20:30] is restored
[1:20:32] his identity
[1:20:34] is restored
[1:20:36] he remembers who he is
[1:20:39] and why he was born
[1:20:42] and and when he leaves this earth he
[1:20:45] doesn't leave it
[1:20:46] in a broken down mulching place of grief
[1:20:50] and depression
[1:20:51] but god says they that wait upon the
[1:20:56] lord
[1:20:57] shall renew
[1:20:58] their strength
[1:21:00] their feathers shall be restored
[1:21:04] i will lift them up on their wings above
[1:21:08] the depressing circumstances of life i
[1:21:11] tell you brother that's a promise i'm
[1:21:14] going to hold on to that
[1:21:15] how many of you believe god can do that
[1:21:17] in your life as a believer because
[1:21:20] you're over 50 doesn't mean that you've
[1:21:23] lived out your best days
[1:21:25] i want you to know i believe that god
[1:21:28] has something for us in the holy spirit
[1:21:31] as we feast on this word that we can
[1:21:34] come into a place where we forget about
[1:21:37] our age
[1:21:38] let me see who amen's
[1:21:42] because i'm going to give you a quote in
[1:21:43] a minute and you'll all amen then
[1:21:46] once you find out that brother branham
[1:21:47] said this very thing
[1:21:49] when that presence of god comes
[1:21:52] we don't look around and start trying to
[1:21:54] remember how old we are
[1:21:56] and how we're not able to do what we
[1:21:58] used to do
[1:21:59] when that presence of the lord comes
[1:22:01] down
[1:22:02] some old feeble grandma
[1:22:05] who could hardly walk in the service
[1:22:07] today
[1:22:08] but when that spirit of the lord comes
[1:22:10] on her she remembers that her feathers
[1:22:13] are being renewed come on now
[1:22:16] and she can stand up as long as the
[1:22:19] young poke the young folk can
[1:22:21] and she can wave her arms in praise
[1:22:24] and shout love to her god like she did
[1:22:28] when she was young because the presence
[1:22:31] of the lord is a transforming force
[1:22:34] and it's a renewing force that god sends
[1:22:37] us
[1:22:38] if we trust in him
[1:22:40] there was a
[1:22:42] let me read this
[1:22:44] there was a an ancient writer whose name
[1:22:46] was saint ambrose
[1:22:48] and he made some notes about
[1:22:51] the eagle in latin
[1:22:54] and the translation is this
[1:22:56] the eagle lives to a very advanced age
[1:23:01] and in molting
[1:23:03] his youth
[1:23:04] is renewed
[1:23:06] with new
[1:23:08] feathers
[1:23:10] a jewish writer
[1:23:12] from ancient times
[1:23:14] wrote this
[1:23:15] long mayest thou live o king
[1:23:19] still
[1:23:20] like the eagle
[1:23:22] renew thy youth
[1:23:24] and still
[1:23:26] retain
[1:23:27] thy vigor
[1:23:29] an ancient rabbi
[1:23:31] sadius
[1:23:32] wrote this every tenth year
[1:23:36] the eagle flies closer to the sun
[1:23:41] and when no able not able any longer
[1:23:45] to bear the burning heat
[1:23:48] will fall down into the sea
[1:23:51] and lose her feathers
[1:23:54] thus
[1:23:55] renewing her strength
[1:23:58] and her vigor
[1:24:01] perhaps you're familiar
[1:24:04] with the eagle messages
[1:24:07] that were passed around
[1:24:09] in the 90s 80s and 90s around message
[1:24:12] believers
[1:24:13] a series of eagle sermons
[1:24:16] from a baptist pastor
[1:24:19] whose name was pastor bobby thompson did
[1:24:22] anybody ever hear those tapes believers
[1:24:24] gave them to me i know you wouldn't
[1:24:26] maybe want to admit it you know but
[1:24:28] believers gave it to me
[1:24:31] and they said you got to hear this
[1:24:33] this man is not a message believer he's
[1:24:36] a baptist pastor but he's preaching
[1:24:38] about the eagle in a way we've never
[1:24:40] heard before and i listened
[1:24:43] and i became so
[1:24:45] interested in what he had to say that i
[1:24:47] had an interview with this man
[1:24:49] and it really really made a difference
[1:24:53] in my thoughts about the eagle
[1:24:56] let me tell this and see if any of you
[1:24:58] will find it at all familiar because
[1:25:00] i've heard many preachers mention this
[1:25:03] bobby thompson was invited
[1:25:06] by the cherokee
[1:25:07] uh
[1:25:08] first nations tribe
[1:25:11] in cherokee north carolina
[1:25:14] to come and
[1:25:16] observe
[1:25:18] an important
[1:25:20] uh
[1:25:20] place
[1:25:22] a sacred place
[1:25:24] in the smoky mountains
[1:25:26] of north carolina
[1:25:28] and they assigned when he agreed and the
[1:25:31] reason why they invited him
[1:25:33] is because they knew he loved eagles
[1:25:36] and he was always preaching about eagles
[1:25:39] and they heard it
[1:25:40] and they said we want to show you
[1:25:42] something about eagles that you have
[1:25:43] never seen before we're sure you haven't
[1:25:46] and he agreed
[1:25:48] and he went
[1:25:49] and he met an indian god cherokee indian
[1:25:53] guide
[1:25:54] they took him to a valley
[1:25:57] in in the smoky mountains
[1:26:00] somewhere between cherokee north
[1:26:02] carolina and maggie valley north
[1:26:05] carolina
[1:26:06] he promised that he would never reveal
[1:26:09] the exact spot
[1:26:11] and this was so far off the beaten path
[1:26:15] that he said i was just hoping they
[1:26:17] didn't get mad at me and leave me out
[1:26:19] there to find my way back by myself
[1:26:22] because he said we went so far
[1:26:25] into those smoky mountains that i didn't
[1:26:27] know if we would ever get back to any
[1:26:30] kind of society
[1:26:32] the indian god set him down on the side
[1:26:35] of a mountain
[1:26:36] and put a pair of binoculars in his hand
[1:26:40] and said to him
[1:26:42] preacher
[1:26:43] i'd like for you to
[1:26:46] survey
[1:26:47] this valley
[1:26:49] and i'd like for you to tell me how many
[1:26:51] eagles you see
[1:26:53] and with his natural eyes
[1:26:56] he looked out across the valley
[1:26:58] he didn't see any eagles at all he said
[1:27:00] look closer
[1:27:02] and he said i was i was looking out
[1:27:05] across that
[1:27:06] valley to the other mountain over there
[1:27:09] and
[1:27:10] i was looking all up and around and
[1:27:13] turning my head and
[1:27:14] i couldn't see an eagle anywhere
[1:27:17] and he said well let me see how many i
[1:27:19] count and he counted about 30 the indian
[1:27:22] god
[1:27:23] he counted about 30.
[1:27:25] and bobby said i can't see them
[1:27:28] he said no you're looking in the wrong
[1:27:29] place he said what do you mean i'm
[1:27:31] looking where eagles usually are
[1:27:35] in the sky
[1:27:37] he said oh no they're not in the sky
[1:27:39] this is a valley of death
[1:27:42] the eagles come here
[1:27:44] to die
[1:27:45] they don't come here to live
[1:27:48] but he said
[1:27:49] some of these eagles
[1:27:52] they find their way
[1:27:55] and they renew
[1:27:57] their
[1:27:59] and they
[1:28:01] live
[1:28:02] for many more years
[1:28:05] bobby said to the indian god he said
[1:28:08] what's the difference
[1:28:10] what determines
[1:28:11] whether or not
[1:28:13] an eagle
[1:28:14] comes here to die
[1:28:16] or whether he uses this
[1:28:18] as a place of renewal
[1:28:20] and he began to explain to him
[1:28:23] that the cherokee indians
[1:28:26] have observed eagles for so many
[1:28:29] hundreds of years
[1:28:31] they've become so familiar with their
[1:28:33] behavior
[1:28:34] that they have been able to identify
[1:28:37] this molting period in their life
[1:28:40] and at a certain age or as brother
[1:28:43] branham described it in a cycle of life
[1:28:47] the eagle
[1:28:49] would begin
[1:28:50] to
[1:28:51] show his age
[1:28:53] his feathers
[1:28:55] would begin
[1:28:56] to
[1:28:58] wilt
[1:28:59] and unravel
[1:29:02] and he would really look a mess
[1:29:05] he would fly down from all over the
[1:29:08] country
[1:29:10] the indians said i believe there are
[1:29:12] eagles here from nearly every state
[1:29:15] where eagles survive
[1:29:17] they come here
[1:29:19] to this valley
[1:29:21] and they fly down into the bottom floor
[1:29:26] of the valley
[1:29:27] and they begin to walk around
[1:29:30] like other birds
[1:29:32] he said we have watched them closely
[1:29:36] for all of these years and they're only
[1:29:38] here for a short amount of time
[1:29:41] before they forget how to fly
[1:29:45] that's about the saddest thing i can
[1:29:46] think of
[1:29:48] in the life of an eagle
[1:29:50] that it would forget how to fly
[1:29:53] the
[1:29:54] talons
[1:29:55] become brittle
[1:29:58] and
[1:29:59] crack
[1:30:00] and break
[1:30:02] therefore rendering the eagle
[1:30:05] unable to catch its prey
[1:30:08] to feed itself
[1:30:10] feathers bloody
[1:30:12] tattered
[1:30:13] torn
[1:30:15] he said let me show you this and he
[1:30:18] pointed out some eagles that were
[1:30:19] wallowing
[1:30:21] in the dirt
[1:30:22] like a dog
[1:30:24] would wallow around in the yard
[1:30:27] he said they get so depressed
[1:30:31] they get so low
[1:30:33] they forget how to fly
[1:30:36] and they wallow around
[1:30:38] in the dirt and the dust
[1:30:41] until they die
[1:30:43] this is so sad
[1:30:45] for me to think about
[1:30:48] he said there is a calcium
[1:30:51] crust
[1:30:53] that starts forming on their beak
[1:30:56] and they breathe through holes
[1:31:00] not a nose like you and i have but holes
[1:31:03] there on the face
[1:31:05] and
[1:31:05] this
[1:31:06] calcium deposit
[1:31:08] like a crust
[1:31:10] begins to form over the breathing hole
[1:31:14] suffocating
[1:31:16] the life of that old eagle
[1:31:19] until he eventually
[1:31:21] draws his last breath
[1:31:24] unable to fly
[1:31:26] wallowing around in the dirt no longer
[1:31:28] the king of the birds
[1:31:30] the regal creature that it was created
[1:31:33] to be
[1:31:34] but now an old broken down bird with
[1:31:37] broken talons and bloody feathers and
[1:31:40] a crusty beak and it draws its last
[1:31:43] breath
[1:31:45] just about the time
[1:31:48] that bobby was going to ask another
[1:31:49] question
[1:31:52] the eagle said oh
[1:31:53] the indians said wait a minute
[1:31:55] he said look there with the binoculars
[1:31:57] he said i see some eagles that are
[1:32:00] circling up above
[1:32:02] and bobby said well what are they doing
[1:32:05] he said they're looking for prey
[1:32:08] they're
[1:32:09] about to prepare a feast
[1:32:15] for the dying eagles in the valley
[1:32:18] hear me now
[1:32:20] i hope you're not too bored
[1:32:22] to hear what i'm going to say
[1:32:25] these are younger eagles
[1:32:28] the bobby said to the to the indian
[1:32:30] these are younger eagles he said
[1:32:32] sometimes
[1:32:34] usually
[1:32:36] but not always
[1:32:38] he said i'll explain that to you later
[1:32:41] he said but
[1:32:42] what they're going to do is they're
[1:32:44] going to go down and they're going to
[1:32:45] catch a rabbit
[1:32:47] and they're going to pull that rabbit
[1:32:48] apart using their strong sharp talons
[1:32:51] and their strong sharp beak
[1:32:55] they're going to pull that in little
[1:32:56] pieces
[1:32:58] and then they're going to fly down over
[1:33:00] the valley
[1:33:01] and they're going to drop handfuls on
[1:33:04] purpose
[1:33:06] they're going to feed those eagles who
[1:33:09] have lost their ability
[1:33:11] to feed themselves is anybody with me
[1:33:17] and he said
[1:33:18] in that moment
[1:33:21] it's going to be determined
[1:33:23] which eagle lives
[1:33:25] and which eagle dies
[1:33:27] folks if you stop eating
[1:33:32] you're going to die
[1:33:34] if we don't utilize the resources that
[1:33:36] god has given us in this message and we
[1:33:38] stop eating because we think we've
[1:33:40] learned it all
[1:33:41] we're gonna die
[1:33:43] you better not let your pride keep you
[1:33:46] from reaching up and taking a piece of
[1:33:48] fresh meat when somebody passes by to
[1:33:51] drop it to you or when you're able to
[1:33:54] put that tape in and hear the voice of
[1:33:57] god speaking to you in that manner
[1:34:00] he said if
[1:34:01] these eagles and he pointed them out and
[1:34:04] now
[1:34:05] now bobby could see them through the
[1:34:08] through the binoculars he could see all
[1:34:10] these eagles
[1:34:11] wallowing around and
[1:34:14] rolling around in the dirt he said it
[1:34:16] was the saddest thing he'd ever seen
[1:34:19] and he said i gotta see this
[1:34:21] it'll be like a feeding frenzy
[1:34:24] when that food comes dropping down and
[1:34:26] the indians said no no
[1:34:28] no it won't
[1:34:29] you'll be surprised it'll be one here
[1:34:33] it'll be one there
[1:34:35] nobody knows why an eagle chooses to eat
[1:34:38] when he's dying
[1:34:39] and why he chooses not to eat but he
[1:34:42] said you've got to see it for yourself
[1:34:44] and he said they dropped down little
[1:34:46] tiny pieces of
[1:34:48] rabbit that had been torn apart
[1:34:51] and here comes
[1:34:52] one eagle and maybe another one will
[1:34:54] come and
[1:34:56] they crawl can you imagine
[1:34:58] crawling in the dirt to get over there
[1:35:01] and eating that piece of of fresh meat
[1:35:04] and finally another one would come and
[1:35:06] he said i noticed that less than half of
[1:35:08] the eagles
[1:35:10] would even eat
[1:35:12] and the indian god said by morning most
[1:35:15] of those down there
[1:35:17] will be dead
[1:35:19] he said but we're going to give it a day
[1:35:21] and i'm going to bring you back out here
[1:35:23] and show you what happens
[1:35:25] to those eagles that choose to eat and
[1:35:28] so a day later
[1:35:30] he goes out and
[1:35:31] he's looking around to try to find
[1:35:34] the eagles and he sees so many dead
[1:35:37] they didn't eat the food that was
[1:35:39] prepared and dropped for them and they
[1:35:42] died and they're just laying their
[1:35:44] carcasses everywhere and
[1:35:46] he said hey where
[1:35:48] are the eagles
[1:35:49] that chose to eat the food
[1:35:53] i don't see them
[1:35:55] did they not eat enough
[1:35:57] did they die
[1:35:59] as well
[1:36:00] and the indian god said raise your
[1:36:02] binoculars up just a little bit out of
[1:36:04] the valley oh
[1:36:10] i know the punch line so i'm already
[1:36:12] excited
[1:36:14] just a little bit all about 10 feet off
[1:36:16] the ground you don't have to get very
[1:36:18] high
[1:36:19] just about 10 feet off the ground and he
[1:36:21] began to scour the edge of the canyon on
[1:36:24] the other side there's an eagle
[1:36:27] they're they're not flying yet
[1:36:31] they don't have enough breath to fly
[1:36:34] they don't have enough strength to fly
[1:36:37] but they've gotten just enough brother
[1:36:40] to use the bend of their
[1:36:43] uh wings like elbows
[1:36:47] have you ever felt like that
[1:36:51] pulling themselves up
[1:36:53] an inch at a time
[1:36:55] they know
[1:36:57] it's like the little men in the bible
[1:36:59] why should we hear till we die
[1:37:01] if we stay here we're going to die
[1:37:04] if we go there we may die but we may not
[1:37:08] so the little eagles make the same
[1:37:10] decision we may not make it all the way
[1:37:12] to the top
[1:37:14] we may not get our flight back
[1:37:17] but at least we won't have to die down
[1:37:19] here with those who refuse to eat so
[1:37:22] they start climbing
[1:37:23] and they climb
[1:37:25] and they climb
[1:37:27] and they climb
[1:37:29] if you thought they looked bad
[1:37:32] when they were down in the dirty valley
[1:37:34] you ought to see them as they climbed
[1:37:36] the mountain
[1:37:37] he said we came back the next day
[1:37:40] and i was looking down low for him
[1:37:43] and he said raise your binoculars again
[1:37:46] so he raised his binoculars up and
[1:37:49] they'd made it about halfway across the
[1:37:50] mountain and he pointed them out there's
[1:37:53] one there's one there's one they were
[1:37:56] moving about an inch at a time
[1:37:59] there's something in that eagle that
[1:38:01] says i've got to get out of this
[1:38:03] i can't lay here and die like this
[1:38:05] i can't fizzle out like this i was born
[1:38:08] for something bigger than this
[1:38:10] do you hear what i'm saying
[1:38:12] and so they're using all they have
[1:38:15] to start climbing up out of that valley
[1:38:18] oh
[1:38:19] hallelujah
[1:38:21] hallelujah
[1:38:24] let me stop and read
[1:38:26] i'll come back
[1:38:28] i want you to hear what the prophet said
[1:38:31] letting off the pressure
[1:38:33] let me see what time it is
[1:38:36] thank you
[1:38:39] paragraph 40. going to be a little bit
[1:38:41] of reading here i hope you don't mind
[1:38:43] paragraph 40 letting off the pressure
[1:38:46] aberdeen north carolina not too far
[1:38:49] from where this event took place
[1:38:51] paragraph 40. i was reading here not
[1:38:53] long ago
[1:38:55] i preached a subject called the eagles
[1:38:57] to earth its nest in chicago and i was
[1:39:00] reading about a certain kind of eagle
[1:39:03] he said there's 40 different kinds of
[1:39:05] them they claim
[1:39:06] mean they it means a ripper with a beak
[1:39:10] god always likens his people to eagles
[1:39:14] he calls himself
[1:39:16] jehovah eagle
[1:39:18] and his little eaglets
[1:39:21] that's those who are born of him
[1:39:24] and i made a little
[1:39:25] rude illustration on that
[1:39:27] many times on that how that eagle gets
[1:39:30] their little ones ready to fly
[1:39:32] and takes them up in the air and turns
[1:39:35] them loose
[1:39:36] and if a crow tries to get up there
[1:39:39] every feather would fall out of him
[1:39:41] he's not pressurized to it
[1:39:44] see he couldn't stand the pressure did
[1:39:46] you know
[1:39:48] you were specifically built to stand the
[1:39:51] pressure of this last church age
[1:39:55] you think when you look back at the ox
[1:39:57] age you say that's the hardest age there
[1:39:59] ever was but that's not the way it is at
[1:40:01] all you're living in the most wicked age
[1:40:04] the world has ever known the the closing
[1:40:06] hours of laodicea and yet you as a
[1:40:09] believer of this message were built
[1:40:13] to withstand the pressure of this age
[1:40:18] i'm quoting again
[1:40:20] he said but the eagle is the only bird
[1:40:22] that's born with that kind of a feather
[1:40:24] that can go so high until a hawk
[1:40:26] couldn't even come around him
[1:40:29] and he's got eyes
[1:40:31] and higher you go the further you can
[1:40:33] see
[1:40:35] and what good would it do to him to get
[1:40:37] up there if he didn't have eyes to see
[1:40:40] way
[1:40:41] away
[1:40:42] he couldn't see
[1:40:44] listen he couldn't see back
[1:40:46] where he come
[1:40:48] from
[1:40:49] that's going to be important in a little
[1:40:51] bit
[1:40:52] 41
[1:40:54] this certain kind of eagle
[1:40:56] when he begins to get old
[1:40:58] he gets weary
[1:41:00] like all of us old people
[1:41:11] well the bible said it didn't it jordan
[1:41:13] the bible said even the young people i
[1:41:15] hear way more young people telling me
[1:41:17] how tired they are than i do old people
[1:41:21] they're exhausted all the time you ever
[1:41:22] notice that about young people today
[1:41:24] they're exhausted all the time they're
[1:41:26] so worn out they can hardly get through
[1:41:28] life
[1:41:29] we're going to have to show them
[1:41:30] something after a while
[1:41:32] come on
[1:41:34] you gotta he said you couldn't see back
[1:41:36] where you come from there's too much
[1:41:38] pressure and he said there's a certain
[1:41:39] kind of eagle when he gets old he gets
[1:41:41] weary like all of us old people and he
[1:41:44] gets a crust over his head
[1:41:46] see here's brother branham telling the
[1:41:48] same kind of story
[1:41:50] gets a crust over his head he gets so
[1:41:51] weary he don't know what to do
[1:41:57] brother aaron i've been
[1:41:58] there i wouldn't know when i got there
[1:42:01] but i've been there more than once
[1:42:03] i was there oh about 18 months ago or
[1:42:06] nearly two years ago when this coveted
[1:42:08] thing began to break
[1:42:10] and my mind was so tormented by all the
[1:42:14] thoughts of how important my decisions
[1:42:17] in the next few weeks were going to be
[1:42:20] to seek the mind of god
[1:42:23] will we have service
[1:42:25] will we not have service
[1:42:27] will we ask the people to wear masks
[1:42:30] will we not ask them to wear men i got
[1:42:33] so weary
[1:42:35] in trying to make decisions
[1:42:37] that in my mind i would have liked to
[1:42:39] have resigned and ran away somewhere
[1:42:42] where i didn't have to make any more
[1:42:44] such serious
[1:42:46] decisions
[1:42:48] so weary and so worn out
[1:42:51] but i knew i couldn't stay there
[1:42:53] because there was a people depending on
[1:42:56] me
[1:42:56] to know what to do
[1:42:59] you in your life under your
[1:43:01] circumstances
[1:43:03] you get under pressure like that
[1:43:04] sometime
[1:43:06] and you don't know what to do next
[1:43:09] so brother branham said he gets so weary
[1:43:11] you don't know what to do
[1:43:13] and now the bible said the eagle renews
[1:43:17] his youth
[1:43:21] he said so i studied about this fellow
[1:43:24] and when he gets old and weary
[1:43:27] and crushed all over his head
[1:43:29] he flies just as high as he can
[1:43:32] until he finds a great high
[1:43:36] rock
[1:43:38] he sits down on the side of this rock
[1:43:42] and he sits there and beats his head
[1:43:46] on
[1:43:48] the rock
[1:43:49] now let me pick up my story and i'll
[1:43:51] come back to the quote
[1:43:54] bobby said
[1:43:56] where are these eagles going
[1:43:59] he said well the eagle has an
[1:44:01] unbelievable memory
[1:44:03] and he is going back to the rock
[1:44:07] where he was born
[1:44:10] he knows in his mind somehow
[1:44:14] in his nature
[1:44:16] i'll be all right
[1:44:21] i'll be all right if i can just get back
[1:44:23] to the rock
[1:44:24] from where i was born
[1:44:26] now brother branham says these eagles
[1:44:28] flew there and no doubt they would if
[1:44:30] they could and maybe they did
[1:44:33] but the ones that bobby thompson saw
[1:44:36] they weren't able to fly
[1:44:37] but they used every bit of strength they
[1:44:39] could get
[1:44:41] to climb that mountain through the rocks
[1:44:43] and through the rubble and through the
[1:44:45] log to get all the way back to the rock
[1:44:47] where they were born
[1:44:49] and when they got there
[1:44:51] bobby said i saw him with my own
[1:44:53] binoculars with my own eyes
[1:44:56] he said they would get back to these big
[1:44:58] old boulders that lay at the top of the
[1:44:59] smoky mountains
[1:45:01] and he said i watched them as they lay
[1:45:03] their their face down on that rock
[1:45:07] and began to scrape back and forth and
[1:45:10] back and forth
[1:45:11] sometimes even beating their
[1:45:14] head on that rock
[1:45:16] to get all that crust off of their head
[1:45:20] and off of their breathing holes
[1:45:22] so that they could breathe
[1:45:24] clearly
[1:45:25] so that their youth could be renewed
[1:45:28] isn't that powerful
[1:45:30] middle of paragraph 41
[1:45:33] he said what's he trying to do
[1:45:35] he's trying to beat the crust off
[1:45:37] all the crust
[1:45:39] and the blood will fly out of his head
[1:45:42] he goes through all kinds of torture
[1:45:44] but as long as he can feel some of that
[1:45:46] crust on him he's got to get it off so
[1:45:48] he keeps beating his head on the rock
[1:45:51] till all the crust
[1:45:54] is off of his head
[1:45:55] and as soon as all of his crust is off
[1:45:57] his head though he's bleeding
[1:46:00] wounded
[1:46:01] he just screams
[1:46:09] let's think of it a moment
[1:46:11] to the top of his voice
[1:46:14] lebron said what's he doing he's letting
[1:46:16] off the pressure
[1:46:19] i want you to know it would do us all
[1:46:20] some good sometime
[1:46:24] to get in a real free service
[1:46:27] and let off some pressure
[1:46:30] you saw me
[1:46:32] you saw me i couldn't help myself
[1:46:36] that
[1:46:37] last was it sunday afternoon i don't
[1:46:39] know when it was i'd already preached
[1:46:40] that morning i was already just feeling
[1:46:42] good and the singing got so good
[1:46:45] and i got so excited and my buddy
[1:46:47] sitting beside me brother jim was so
[1:46:49] excited he was making me excited
[1:46:53] i didn't know
[1:46:55] until i glanced up
[1:46:57] that there were several people looking
[1:46:59] at me
[1:47:00] and i didn't want him to see me
[1:47:02] i wanted him to be focusing on what was
[1:47:05] going on in the service
[1:47:06] and i didn't want to embarrass myself
[1:47:09] so i just took a quick little trip over
[1:47:11] there behind the pulpit where the pulpit
[1:47:13] was sitting
[1:47:14] and i sat down in that chair and i
[1:47:16] raised my hands where nobody could see
[1:47:18] what expression was and i let off the
[1:47:20] pressure i just began to praise him the
[1:47:23] way i wanted to praise him
[1:47:25] normally you wouldn't have that
[1:47:27] opportunity to do it in his but i took
[1:47:29] it and i started to apologize later and
[1:47:32] then i realized that i had said that
[1:47:34] morning in service i can't apologize for
[1:47:37] praising the lord
[1:47:39] sometimes we've just got to let off the
[1:47:41] pressure
[1:47:42] and give him praise
[1:47:44] for what he's done
[1:47:46] brother branham said when he gets all
[1:47:48] that crust off he screams
[1:47:51] to the top of his voice
[1:47:54] because as soon as that crust is off his
[1:47:56] youth
[1:47:57] is renewed
[1:48:00] he said it's sure to come
[1:48:03] so as soon as all that crust is gone
[1:48:06] he can start screaming
[1:48:09] hallelujah
[1:48:11] because he knows he's got rid of all the
[1:48:14] crust
[1:48:15] his youth is about to be renewed so he
[1:48:18] can let off the pressure and start
[1:48:19] screaming because he's going back to a
[1:48:22] young eagle again
[1:48:24] he said that's wonderful
[1:48:25] i'm glad for that eagle
[1:48:28] i'm glad for that bird but he said you
[1:48:31] know i know a rock
[1:48:33] where we can go
[1:48:36] hallelujah
[1:48:38] and be in prayer
[1:48:41] till all the crust of the world
[1:48:43] is beat away from us till all the
[1:48:46] unbelief in god's word is beat away till
[1:48:49] we enter into a place where all things
[1:48:52] are possible and as soon as we got all
[1:48:55] the world and unbelief in god's word
[1:48:58] beat off of us we can scream and shout
[1:49:00] because eternal life is sure
[1:49:03] just as certain as anything because all
[1:49:06] the world has been beat off
[1:49:09] of us
[1:49:11] in another rendering of the same sermon
[1:49:14] in paragraph 76
[1:49:16] in green lake wisconsin he said and if
[1:49:18] he can't knock it off he dies
[1:49:21] he can't breathe
[1:49:23] if he can't get rid of that crust
[1:49:26] he dies but if he gets it knocked off
[1:49:30] he'll start rejoicing
[1:49:32] and screaming
[1:49:34] you can hear him for miles
[1:49:36] just screaming
[1:49:38] because he got all the crust off
[1:49:40] he said that's wonderful i want to tell
[1:49:42] you church that's wonderful
[1:49:45] that's wonderful
[1:49:47] had he not chosen to eat the food
[1:49:52] can't force feed somebody
[1:49:54] but you can help them get to it
[1:49:57] you can give them the supernatural you
[1:49:59] can give them the tapes you can put it
[1:50:01] in their life
[1:50:02] and let them decide what they do with it
[1:50:04] but you can't force feed people but if
[1:50:07] they choose to eat it i want you to know
[1:50:09] god has given us a message that will
[1:50:11] help us get above everything that tries
[1:50:13] to keep us tethered to this whole world
[1:50:16] so bobby thompson said
[1:50:21] that with his own eyes
[1:50:23] he watched one of those eagles it made
[1:50:25] it back to the rock
[1:50:28] he saw with his own eyes it's scraping
[1:50:31] that
[1:50:32] crust off of his beak and he said i i
[1:50:34] was zeroed in on the binocular with him
[1:50:38] and i saw what looked like tears
[1:50:42] running down the eagle's face
[1:50:45] he was so happy to be back to the rock
[1:50:47] from where he had been born
[1:50:50] and bobby thompson said i watched that
[1:50:52] eagle
[1:50:53] make his way off to the edge of that
[1:50:55] rock
[1:50:56] and
[1:50:57] rare his wings back and lift up his head
[1:51:00] and let out a call
[1:51:03] that reverberated off of the rocks of
[1:51:05] the smoky mountains
[1:51:07] and he said you know i realized what he
[1:51:09] was doing he was praising his creator
[1:51:12] but he said i thought i i'd like to see
[1:51:14] if it's having any other impact
[1:51:17] so i looked down in the valley and i saw
[1:51:20] other little eagles down there that had
[1:51:22] been rolling around in the dirt they
[1:51:24] stopped
[1:51:26] and they raised their heads to try to
[1:51:28] see where that scream was coming from he
[1:51:32] said i don't know for sure but it looked
[1:51:34] to me like it gave them some
[1:51:36] encouragement
[1:51:38] hey
[1:51:39] a brother has made it all the way back
[1:51:42] to the rock a brother is sounding an
[1:51:45] alarm to say my youth is being renewed
[1:51:50] and if you'll press your way out of the
[1:51:52] valley
[1:51:53] if you'll allow your strength to be used
[1:51:56] up in getting out of the position that
[1:51:59] you're in right now you two will have a
[1:52:01] have something to to scream about
[1:52:06] he said it takes several weeks
[1:52:09] for the feathers to come back in
[1:52:12] because when that eagle is done with the
[1:52:14] crust
[1:52:15] he starts plucking those bloody feathers
[1:52:19] out
[1:52:20] one by one
[1:52:22] waiting
[1:52:23] for new feathers
[1:52:24] to come
[1:52:27] and he said i happen to be there one day
[1:52:29] when an eagle that had been spending a
[1:52:32] several weeks on the rock
[1:52:34] decided it was time to move on
[1:52:37] and i watched him as he
[1:52:39] climbed up he began to fly up above that
[1:52:42] rock and
[1:52:44] and way up into the air and
[1:52:46] i heard him as he screamed encouragement
[1:52:49] down
[1:52:50] it seemed like to all the other eagles
[1:52:53] and he said then i watched him as he
[1:52:55] went swooping
[1:52:58] right back to the valley
[1:53:01] where he had come out of and i said oh
[1:53:02] no
[1:53:04] something has gone wrong
[1:53:06] and the indian god said oh no something
[1:53:09] has gone right
[1:53:11] he's looking for a rabbit
[1:53:16] he now has the strength to feed himself
[1:53:20] but more importantly than that the first
[1:53:22] thing he's going to do
[1:53:24] is take some fresh meat
[1:53:26] back to those others
[1:53:30] hallelujah
[1:53:32] now i know life is hard
[1:53:35] and i know that we feel beat up
[1:53:38] in this end time 2022
[1:53:41] the pressures of life
[1:53:44] the pressures of
[1:53:47] of vaccination and
[1:53:49] mandate and
[1:53:51] the pressure of not wanting to
[1:53:54] pass something on to somebody else's
[1:53:57] it's more than some of us can really
[1:53:59] function under
[1:54:01] it feels like it's more than we can
[1:54:03] stand
[1:54:04] and we get weary
[1:54:06] and we get tired
[1:54:08] just a few more moments here and we'll
[1:54:09] go
[1:54:11] we get discouraged
[1:54:13] we get tired of doing the same old thing
[1:54:16] week after week
[1:54:17] you ought to be a song leader
[1:54:22] you ought to be a preacher
[1:54:24] you ought to be a musician
[1:54:27] someone who doesn't just get to come and
[1:54:29] casually observe a service
[1:54:31] but somebody that has to put everything
[1:54:33] in every service
[1:54:34] it gets old looking for the right song
[1:54:36] to lead
[1:54:38] it gets old sometimes looking for the
[1:54:40] right message to bring and
[1:54:42] making the right decision
[1:54:44] so every one of us face our own set
[1:54:48] of pressures
[1:54:49] and circumstances
[1:54:51] and every one of us can get down in that
[1:54:53] valley
[1:54:54] and feel like there's no more hope
[1:54:57] to ever get out of it again but i want
[1:54:59] to tell you something
[1:55:01] this word
[1:55:02] releases to us an anointing of a flying
[1:55:06] eagle
[1:55:07] you can come out of the valley
[1:55:10] oh help me now let's close
[1:55:12] you can come out of the valley
[1:55:15] you can get above your stuff you can
[1:55:18] climb out of the snake line
[1:55:22] i remember there used to be an old black
[1:55:24] singer whose name was
[1:55:26] fc barnes
[1:55:29] and he used to sing this song it ain't
[1:55:31] going to sound pretty but i'm going to
[1:55:32] show you how it went
[1:55:34] he said i'm coming up
[1:55:40] on the rough side
[1:55:43] of the mountain
[1:55:47] and i'm
[1:55:49] doing my best
[1:55:52] to make it in
[1:55:56] and every time i hear that song
[1:55:59] i can see those little eagles
[1:56:02] they must be singing i'm coming up the
[1:56:04] rough side
[1:56:05] of the mountain
[1:56:07] but i am determined
[1:56:09] to find my youth renewed in the spirit
[1:56:12] i am determined not to let my problems
[1:56:15] and my circumstances keep me
[1:56:18] in the mulley grubs
[1:56:20] or in the moping period
[1:56:23] of discouragement
[1:56:25] i want to close with this quotation and
[1:56:28] thank you for being patient with me
[1:56:31] i want to get this out and be done
[1:56:34] in the message
[1:56:36] as the eagle stirs her nest
[1:56:39] paragraph
[1:56:40] 55 brother branham said as an eagle
[1:56:44] renews his youth yes sir
[1:56:48] the revival takes and shakes all the old
[1:56:52] funny feelings away from you
[1:56:55] and you fly out into an atmosphere
[1:56:57] yonder
[1:57:00] likened his heritage
[1:57:02] to an eagle
[1:57:04] because the eagle renews his youth
[1:57:08] now it makes him shout
[1:57:11] he said you watch the church
[1:57:13] it'll be sitting all dry
[1:57:16] first thing you know
[1:57:18] the holy ghost strikes them
[1:57:22] why the old person
[1:57:24] the old person
[1:57:26] that's a lot of us
[1:57:28] the old person
[1:57:30] will be up on their feet
[1:57:36] jumping
[1:57:38] shouting
[1:57:40] praising god
[1:57:43] renews their youth again that's right
[1:57:46] he said why in that moment they could do
[1:57:48] anything a young person could do
[1:57:52] folks
[1:57:53] that's what the spirit of the lord
[1:57:56] can do for your old tired bones
[1:57:59] amen brother
[1:58:01] that's what the holy spirit can do for
[1:58:04] us who have been
[1:58:06] so down and so discouraged for so long
[1:58:10] he can move in your life
[1:58:12] and cause you to feel like you're a
[1:58:14] young person again when you get in the
[1:58:17] presence of the lord
[1:58:18] he said why they can do anything a young
[1:58:20] person can do
[1:58:22] just jump and holler and scream and
[1:58:23] shout
[1:58:25] he renews his youth
[1:58:27] that's right
[1:58:29] brother brahm said i believe in that
[1:58:31] and he asked us the question
[1:58:33] don't you
[1:58:35] i want to tell you something i do
[1:58:38] i do believe in that
[1:58:41] i do believe
[1:58:43] that we have everything we need
[1:58:45] to see our spiritual youth renewed
[1:58:49] i believe we have everything we need in
[1:58:51] this word to get above every
[1:58:53] circumstance and every problem if we
[1:58:56] just make up our minds denied i'm coming
[1:58:58] out of this valley
[1:58:59] i'm determined to get to back to the
[1:59:01] rock
[1:59:03] scrape my beak and beat my face on the
[1:59:05] rock of where i was born until my my
[1:59:09] strength is renewed and my youth is
[1:59:11] restored and my feathers become new
[1:59:14] again and i can live the rest of my life
[1:59:16] however long it is in in a in a victory
[1:59:20] that only belongs to the believer
[1:59:22] we talked about all that negative talk
[1:59:24] and i want you to know that's what keeps
[1:59:26] us in the money grubs
[1:59:28] if we could begin to speak what god's
[1:59:30] word has promised for us in this hour
[1:59:33] instead of how we feel about it
[1:59:35] if we could understand that god is
[1:59:38] sovereign
[1:59:40] i want to say that he is sovereign
[1:59:44] we worry about things that we don't have
[1:59:46] to worry about
[1:59:48] how about a close i don't said that
[1:59:50] didn't i play they that wait upon the
[1:59:52] lord would you please
[1:59:55] shall renew their strength
[2:00:01] i hear believers saying things like this
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:05] we lost old brother so-and-so
[2:00:07] last week
[2:00:09] [Music]
[2:00:11] if he could have just had a better
[2:00:12] hospital
[2:00:15] if he could have just got to a better
[2:00:17] doctor
[2:00:19] if they could have just got him the
[2:00:20] right medicine
[2:00:22] he'd be with us still
[2:00:25] and i just want to encourage you church
[2:00:27] don't believe that
[2:00:30] it'll run you crazy
[2:00:32] it'll run you crazy it'll take you right
[2:00:34] out of faith
[2:00:36] and it'll put you in fear
[2:00:38] that's not the message that's been
[2:00:39] delivered to us
[2:00:43] benjamin my oldest son said dad what are
[2:00:45] you preaching tonight i said well i'm
[2:00:46] not sure you ask at lunch
[2:00:49] he said i thought you might preach a
[2:00:51] sermon you just preached
[2:00:53] not by luck
[2:00:55] or chance
[2:00:56] or happenstance
[2:00:58] i said no i won't don't think i'll
[2:01:01] preach that tonight
[2:01:03] but i just took those scriptures and
[2:01:04] quotes where
[2:01:06] where brother branham said it doesn't
[2:01:07] happen by
[2:01:09] by just some
[2:01:11] luck or some draw
[2:01:14] if you're a believer
[2:01:16] all of your days are held in the hand of
[2:01:19] the lord
[2:01:21] come on now
[2:01:23] if god is calling you out of this life
[2:01:25] the best hospital
[2:01:28] the best doctor
[2:01:31] somebody said if i could have just
[2:01:33] gotten some of that good medicine from
[2:01:34] mexico
[2:01:36] my loved ones would still be here
[2:01:39] folks
[2:01:40] i believe in the sovereignty of god
[2:01:43] our days are numbered
[2:01:46] god knows the day you're born the day
[2:01:48] you're leaving here
[2:01:50] we can fight hard to stay here
[2:01:52] but how many of you know you don't even
[2:01:54] have to be sick to die
[2:01:57] he comes and he calls
[2:01:59] and we better know we're ready
[2:02:01] we better know we're ready we better
[2:02:03] talk to our young people
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:06] because the standard
[2:02:08] is slipping fast
[2:02:10] in this hour
[2:02:13] we've got to encourage them
[2:02:15] to hold on to god
[2:02:17] and not compromise with the world
[2:02:20] because your salvation is the most
[2:02:22] valuable thing that god has
[2:02:24] placed within your life
[2:02:27] don't allow the enemy to confuse you
[2:02:29] with all those thoughts
[2:02:31] if only
[2:02:33] this could have happened or that could
[2:02:34] have happened
[2:02:36] they might still be with us
[2:02:39] if they left us regardless of their age
[2:02:41] they left here because god called them
[2:02:46] you know brother branham said
[2:02:49] if jesus were to come in here tonight
[2:02:52] and walk down that aisle
[2:02:54] he couldn't do anything for you
[2:02:56] that he hasn't already done
[2:03:00] the price is paid
[2:03:02] hallelujah
[2:03:04] and we're looking to jesus tonight would
[2:03:06] you stand you've been so so patient
[2:03:10] with my annoying voice
[2:03:12] and you've pulled the best you could
[2:03:16] and i appreciate it so much
[2:03:19] but i'm so burdened
[2:03:22] i feel so heavy
[2:03:24] for somebody
[2:03:28] who feels
[2:03:29] so weighty
[2:03:32] so heavy
[2:03:34] and i want to just
[2:03:36] believe god as we prepare to leave here
[2:03:39] shortly
[2:03:40] that he will lift you up
[2:03:44] that he will breathe
[2:03:46] fresh life
[2:03:48] that he will give you enough strength
[2:03:52] to beat your head on the rock of ages
[2:03:56] until all the stuff of this world
[2:03:59] is beat off
[2:04:01] and you can have perfect peace with him
[2:04:05] all the negative
[2:04:08] if we could cast that aside
[2:04:11] and stand on the promises of god tonight
[2:04:15] step back into our destiny
[2:04:19] to the center of god's perfect
[2:04:22] will his timing
[2:04:26] is always impeccable
[2:04:28] he's never too late
[2:04:31] he's never too early
[2:04:33] the songwriter said he may not come when
[2:04:36] you want him
[2:04:38] but he's right on time
[2:04:40] how many of you found that to be true
[2:04:43] with the lord jesus christ
[2:04:46] i want you to bow your hearts and your
[2:04:48] heads for just a moment
[2:04:51] and i want to pray for you
[2:04:55] i want to ask god to give you strength
[2:04:58] to feast on this living word
[2:05:02] that we have at our fingertips
[2:05:04] every single day
[2:05:07] until your
[2:05:09] strength begins to flow back into your
[2:05:11] life
[2:05:13] and you find the grace
[2:05:16] to pull yourself up out of the mud hole
[2:05:20] out of the rut
[2:05:24] that satan has tried to put you in
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:29] i want to pray that
[2:05:33] you get back to the rock
[2:05:35] sooner rather than later
[2:05:38] now i'm not just speaking to those here
[2:05:40] tonight i'm speaking to a host of
[2:05:43] precious friends and believers
[2:05:46] who are streaming the service
[2:05:48] god has victory for you and your life
[2:05:52] he has encouragement where
[2:05:53] discouragement has reigned and ruled
[2:05:56] he has victory
[2:05:58] where you've been walking in
[2:06:00] defeat i believe god wants to make your
[2:06:03] footsteps lighter
[2:06:05] and he wants to encourage you that it's
[2:06:07] not all over
[2:06:09] and it's not all behind you
[2:06:11] that god has gracious grace and
[2:06:13] blessings waiting for us as we press
[2:06:17] into his presence
[2:06:20] i'm asking the lord
[2:06:23] to let somebody
[2:06:25] press into that place of grace
[2:06:29] soon
[2:06:31] if not tonight
[2:06:33] so that they could once again lift up
[2:06:36] their voice
[2:06:38] in exuberant
[2:06:40] thanksgiving and praise
[2:06:43] to the god who has been so gracious
[2:06:46] to us
[2:06:47] we've got so much
[2:06:49] to thank him for
[2:06:52] so much to praise him for
[2:06:55] he's been so good
[2:06:58] your head just kind of bowed still
[2:07:00] i want you to sing this with me before
[2:07:02] we really pray
[2:07:04] they that wait
[2:07:07] upon the lord

[2:20:39] what she needs from the lord tonight
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:44] you are the god of assurance
[2:20:48] you would not have us to wander around
[2:20:51] not knowing
[2:20:53] what you have accomplished in our life
[2:20:56] so i'm asking you lord
[2:20:59] to give her the assurance
[2:21:02] that the holy ghost of god
[2:21:04] has taken her life
[2:21:07] and has filled her
[2:21:09] with the glory of god
[2:21:12] we come against all oppressing thoughts
[2:21:15] [Music]
[2:21:16] in the name of jesus
[2:21:20] lord you see the place that she has
[2:21:22] walked with you
[2:21:24] and what has happened in her physical
[2:21:26] body
[2:21:27] to bring her to this place
[2:21:30] but we are praying tonight
[2:21:32] in faith
[2:21:35] that a battle can be ended in the spirit
[2:21:38] you can call an end to it lord
[2:21:41] as only you can
[2:21:43] and release to her the assurance
[2:21:47] that the holy ghost
[2:21:49] abides in her life
[2:21:51] so we agree with her right now
[2:21:53] hallelujah
[2:21:56] that the accuser
[2:21:58] must be silenced
[2:22:00] we take authority
[2:22:02] over his lies
[2:22:04] and we ask that the holy ghost would
[2:22:07] shield her
[2:22:08] from every lie of the accuser
[2:22:11] to keep her in that place of of not
[2:22:14] knowing and not having full assurance
[2:22:18] may she strike the rock harder tonight
[2:22:20] in the faith and find the freedom
[2:22:24] to soar above it all as you have called
[2:22:27] her to
[2:22:28] thank you for the great witness of the
[2:22:30] holy spirit i feel that witness
[2:22:35] make it real to her
[2:22:38] they that wait
[2:22:40] upon the lord
