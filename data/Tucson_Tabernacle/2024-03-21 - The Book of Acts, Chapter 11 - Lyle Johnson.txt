promote eternity amazing and for I will make with him good evening tonight we're going to continue our exploration in the book of Acts this time our studious Acts 11. this chapter has three parts it wraps up what I call The Curious Case of Cornelius which is in chapter 10 which is setting the stage for the Gentile Church it then tells her the continuing spread of the Gospel among the scattered Jewish population of the region particularly to the north and Syria it concludes we're sending Aid to Jerusalem before we dig in let's pray together and approach the offer Lord Jesus acts sometimes seems like it's it's a history but in second Timothy Paul Rhoden said that all scripture is good for instruction for reproof for Doctrine Lord for instruction in righteousness Lord we're here this evening Lord as as people that desire to serve you that desire to be instructed the desire to hear from you that desire to enter into your word desire for that word to be living in us and moving through us and manifesting itself in it among us as our brother Jordan prayed this morning Lord that we would have that love one for another Lord and our love for you as brother Jonathan spoke two weeks ago that we not be judgmental but Lord you look on the heart all we can do is look on the outside and pray for one another Lord we commit this service to you I pray Lord that you'd help Lyle Johnson to just get out of the way we don't want to hear the musings of my mind or any of the rest of it we want to hear from you we've come expecting to hear from you we've come expecting your presence Lord we've come we've worshiped to bless your name and Lord we ask that you would now bless us with your presence and that you speak each heart we commit the remainder of this evening in this service and to your hands in Jesus precious name amen while we're standing this is a Bible study so please turn in your Bibles our introductory verses as you might guess are not from Acts 11. but we'll start in the book of beginnings Genesis 12. and verse 3. this is God speaking to Abram when he lived in Syria and he told Abram I will bless them that bless thee curse them that curseth they and in thee shall All Families of the Earth be blessed and then from acts 10 that we had our pastor brother Daniel lead us through last Wednesday night the first two verses to set context there was a certain man in caesarea after you've lived in Israel you call it caseria but we'll say caesarea called Cornelius the Centurion of the band called The Italian band a devout man one that feared God with all this house which gave much arms to the people and prayed to God always please be seated this was Acts 10 . it's okay brother I I'm not worried about your uh your blessing on the cup it's about bringing the gospel to the Gentiles God was proceeding gently carefully step by step expanding the gospel Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the outermost ends of the Earth to the and Beyond the descendants of Israel we saw that the early jewish-based church included some Hellenistic Jews those that had been influenced by Greek culture spoke the Greek language and Acts 2 when the Holy Spirit came and filled the Believers Jews from all over the Mediterranean World heard the disciples praising God and their various languages in Acts chapter 6 we saw Nicholas becoming one of the seven deacons and and Luke was careful to point out that Nicholas was a proselyte he was a convert to Judaism from Antioch Antioch will play a role this evening a proselyte is a person that is converted to Judaism so Nicholas was a practitioner of Judaism though we may not have been ethnically a descendant of Abraham we don't know we can also infer from this that there was a large and active Jewish population in Antioch as the persecution arose the gospel message went to Samaria people of mixed Heritage but who were Believers in God followers of Moses teachings we read about this in Acts chapter 8. there we also encountered Philip sharing the gospel with an Ethiopian who had been in Jerusalem to worship and found him reading your school of Isaiah again a proselyte in Acts 10 we met Cornelius a Roman Centurion let's look again a little bit closer at verse 2 of Acts 10 says that he was devout man and one that feared God with all his house which gave much arms to the people and prayed to God always and we read that feared God and we think well he was devout guy and he and he believed in the god of Israel probably well we know we did but but but there's actually if we dig a Little Deeper we find there's more to it than just that it turns out that this appellation calling someone God fearing or one who fears God had a very specific meaning by the first century During the period of the second temple I'm going to read you a very short quote from Dr Isaiah Gaffney of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem who was an authority on second temple Judaism it's from a course he taught in 2008 titled beginnings of of Judea Judaism yes Jewish communities abroad also expanded by virtue of widespread conversion some Gentiles who came in contact with monotheistic teachings converted outright and these are referred to as proselytes others accepted the central tenets of monotheism abandoned Pagan idol worship and observed a limited number of Jewish Customs such as refraining for work on the Sabbath attending Jewish synagogues these semi-converts are referred to in ancient literature as God fearers so this has a very specific meaning in the book of Acts is certainly ancient literature and Cornelius is referred to as one who feared God so we see again that the spread of the Gospel is specific it's gradually erasing boundaries between Jew Cornelius was maybe we might think of as a special class of Gentile a God-fearing person that perhaps straddled the boundary a little bit between Judaism and and and and and and not Judaism but later we'll see the gospel spread to Gentiles that have no affiliation or even knowledge of Judaism regardless Cornelius was a gentile and a barrier was being demolished before we read in Acts 11 let me just give you a little more context what I'm wanting to show you here is where Simon the Tanner Seaside residence was the arrows are pointing there it's on the south of modern day Tel Aviv there's a a place there that is that is believed to be or is claimed to be Simon the Tanner's house Perhaps it is it's about eight miles from there to Lido with the Bible calls lighter nowadays it's called lud it's where Ben Gurion International Airport is is where I work for a few years about eight miles from from uh lighter to Joppa which is where Simon the Tanner's house was and where Peter happened to be the other town that played a big part in Acts 10 and plays a definite part tonight is what we call caesarea we learned that uh assessor that Cornelius was stationed by the Imperial Roman army at caesarea a Seaport City in the northern part of the District of Samaria this was a city that was built by Herod the Great to honor Caesar Augustus his uh the guy that sort of ensured that Herod was in power I just have a couple of arrows here to point something out to you this is an artist's rendition you can see here in in your upper left that there's an artificial Harbor that's built or there aren't any good natural Harbors on the coast of Israel so he built this Breakwater place here for the ships to come in and have a have a safe harbor and this was a very very uh Hellenistic very dramatic City Herod the Great didn't do things on a small scale um and you can see here this where this Arrow was pointing this little spit of land corresponds to this you can see the shadow in the water of that Breakwater that was built 2 000 years ago this was a massive project and you can see down here in Amphitheater and here's the remains of a hippodrome or Racetrack and so forth this place of course needed fresh water so they built a series of aqueducts and and again this is to show Rome's might and so forth but there's a very important archaeological find that also came from caesarea some of you may be aware of this it's it's apparently a Cornerstone or something that has an inscription and it says here this is a Caesar Tiberius and this is Pontius Pilatus Pontius Pilate it's where we found archaeological evidence not just Joseph a statement or the Bible statement that pilate really was a governor really did exist in this place at this time I find it interesting that this stone is found in the location where new life that was brought through the death that pilate ordered to all that would believe the gospel message was found in caesarea where the gospel first came to the Gentiles lastly I just want to give you an idea how far it is from Joppa down here to caesarea here it's about 35 or 40 miles it's along the plane along the coast the plain of Sharon or the plain of Sharon where we get to Rose of Sharon so with that background understanding that it takes a couple of days to walk 35 or 40 miles at my age it might take more than a couple let's move into Acts chapter 11 and verse 1. we read and the apostles and Brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God what's their reaction it is wonderful news are they rejoicing are they saying go Peter well let's find out Peter comes to Jerusalem when Peter has come up to Jerusalem after staying some days with Cornelius which Cornelius had invited him to do we see that the news repeated from one person to another got there before Peter did and they that were of the circumcision in other words the Jewish Believers and all of them were Jewish Believers in Jerusalem at that time they welcomed him and shouted for Joy at the spreading of the Gospel uh that's not what it says brother Lyle no it says they contended they contended with him what is content the root of that is to separate thoroughly so this is not just a differing opinion but a matter that could lead to a split in the church a disassociation a breaking a fellowship it's very serious to these Believers so they contended with Peter and what was their bone of contention saying thou wentest into men uncircumcised you went into Gentiles and if this isn't enough you ate with them well is that what happened let's let's review again from from Acts 10. verse 27 and as he Peter talked with him Cornelius so Peter has come to accessories of Cornelius house he Peter went in to cornelia's house and found many that were come together so yeah he entered the house and Peter said unto them this is a curious thing he says you know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come into one of another Nation but God assured me I should not call any man calm and or unclean take that I'm sure this what do you guy you're in my house and you're insulting me there's nothing in the law of Moses or in General within Judaism that forbids a Jew from entering a gentile building a residence how else could the priest confer with Roman authorities how could Daniel live in a ballast in Babylon when he was taken captive or how could David hang out with the Philistines when he fled from King Saul there's there's nothing about that so but maybe a tradition or something of Jewish culture at in the first century the rabbinical sources suggest that there was no such rule but there was a price to pay because if you go into the Gentiles house you now become ceremonially unclean so you have to go through a ritual cleansing process reminds you a little bit about John the Baptist baptizing people in the Jordan River so you have to go through something to take away that impurity so there's nothing unlawful about going into the Gentiles house eating that's that's a Jewish dietary law and practice in general made it almost impossible for a Jewish person to eat Foods prepared by gentiles there was great sensitivity about this then and there still is today in fact it's an issue that caused Paul to publicly embarrass Peter a few years later Peter's visit to Antioch remember Antioch is going to play a big part in Acts 11. it's not recorded in acts when Peter visited Antioch but it probably occurred between what we call the first and second missionary journeys of Paul let's read briefly about this in Galatians 2. I know it's a lot of reading that we're doing tonight but it's a Bible study Galatians 2 but when Peter was come to Antioch I Paul withstood him it's the same phrase as Janice and jambers withstood Moses this is a confrontation it's not a quiet whisper in the corner is it brother come here a minute let me talk no I withstood him to the face got up close and personal Toe to Toe nose to nose why because Peter was to be blamed he was guilty well what was he guilty of he said because before that certain men came from James in other words Peter was up there in Antioch for a while and then some guys came up from Jerusalem the Jewish Church in Jerusalem up until that time Peter was eating with the Gentiles but when the Jewish Christians from James group came to Jerusalem that is when they arrived in Antioch Peter withdrew he separated himself from the Gentile Believers fearing them which were of the circumcision he knew they would strongly disapprove in spite of what we read in Acts 10 and we'll rehearse tonight and acts 11. and other Jews Jewish Believers of Antioch followed Peter's example look Peter is a bigger than life guy he's got quite a reputation in front of him this it's not Peter who Peter who no this is Peter yeah yeah so so he's influencing people influences brother Jordan mentioned this morning influence and withdrew okay they did and the other Jews dissembled which is the opposite of assembled they separated themselves they withdrew they were clannish the root of this word dissembled means acted with deceit or a feigned action insincere so they're separating themselves not because they believe they can't do this but but because they don't want to get a don't like on their Facebook page right it's all about men's approval and he says to the point that that in so much that Paul's talking here he says it and somebody said my good friend my fellow laborer and spreading the gospel went on missionary Journeys as they risked his life to bring the word Barnabas was also carried away with their deceitful Behavior when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said to Peter before them all in front of everybody Peter if thou being a Jew live after the manner of Gentiles and not as do the Jews why compel us out the Gentiles to live as to the Jews Paul's calling out hypocrisy in this Behavior he's extending it not just to this clannish Behavior seeking approval but he extends it if you read further in Galatians to denying the very Christ that saves us he goes on to contrast justification by faith rather than by works of the law so this tradition this undercurrent of being separate was very strong it reminds me this is confronting myself to my face that when when I came into what we call the message I was among many that separated from our denominational friends thinking that somehow I was closer to God or a better Christian than they were I was a part of that I was guilty it reminds me also of the testimony brother Jonathan shared a couple of weeks ago from Brother Branham about going to that dunkard restaurant and being so condemning and judgmental of what he saw because what he saw was totally wrong until the Lord reminded him yeah and what did I save you from so there are lessons to be learned every day and almost every verse of the book of Acts well getting back to acts 11 I don't want to keep it past about 10 o'clock tonight so verse 4 but Peter in response to the contention and accusation of the Jewish Believers remember he's just come to Jerusalem and they said look you've been doing this this bad thing he rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded he explained it by order he said look here's what happened I don't know what you've heard you've only heard part of this let me tell you what happened I was in the city of Joppa praying and in a trance I saw a vision a certain vessel to send as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by the Four Corners and it came it came down to me and upon which one I've looked when I fastened my eyes I considered and saw four footed Beasts of the earth wild beasts creeping things fouls of the air lizards snake spiders bugs pigs Hawks and I heard a voice saying unto me arise Peter slay and eat but I said not so Lord nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth well this is a curious event Peter somehow recognizes the voices being that of the Lord but it seems he's being commanded to violate the word of God delivered by the prophet Moses to violate the way he's lived all of his life to violate the way that he lived when he walked with Jesus to violate the way that Jesus lived Peter was a Jew what's going on you can imagine what's going through through his mind there are several places where God makes it very clear that the Israelites Peter's group were to avoid certain foods we read it briefly in Leviticus 20 as they're getting ready to enter into the land God says you shall therefore keep all my statutes all and all my judgments and do them that the land whether I bring you to dwell therein spew you not out that sounds a little bit like laodicea so even after being conquered and banished the Israelite people are once again dwelling in their land even if it's under the rule of Rome you shall not walk in the manners of the nation which I cast out before you for they committed all these things that were listed earlier and therefore I abort them but I have said unto you you shall inherit their land I will give it to you to possess it a lamb that floweth with milk and honey I am the Lord your God which have separated you from other people and now here it comes the word of God direct from the pen of the Prophet who received it at Mount Sinai the prophet that even Jesus was compared to the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me this isn't a minor Prophet this isn't Nathan talking to David this is Moses ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean and between unclean vowels and clean so this isn't just some tradition it also isn't something that needs a lot of interpretation you shall not make your souls abominable by Beast or by make your souls abominable by Beast or by fowl or any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground Peter said you saw creeping things which I who the Lord himself have separated from you is unclean these creatures held in the Sheep by the Four Corners ye shall be holy unto me for I the Lord am Holy and have severed you from other people that you in Leviticus chapter 11 it details it gives you the list of what's clean and what's unclean how you can tell you can eat this you can't eat that very specific one of the things I find interesting in that list is is the Raven is unclean but God used the Raven to bring morsels of food to Elijah during the famine God used the unclean to serve the clean in that case first king 17 if you want to look it up getting back to acts 11 we have Peter seeing a vision and he's hearing a voice that's a apparently telling him to intentionally disobey the spoken and written word of God to the Jewish people let me repeat that he's being ordered by a voice and a vision to do something that's clearly forbidden question if you had such a vision being told to do something you recognize as being absolutely and clearly in violation of what you have been taught by and through a Vindicated prophet of God would you accept it as being from the Lord would you reject it like Martin did how would you know how would you feel if you were Peter in front of his group you're being challenged about this to relate what happened can't you hear that audience rising up and objecting at this point when Peter says in the voice commanded me to eat this thing I can see those people standing up and saying Peter that wasn't from God that's not scriptural you're going against the scripture brother you should not have done that that proves that you're wrong we can show you over here in Leviticus where you're violating the word God can't go against his own word so what's going on is this and if it's not and if it really is the Lord what sort of a test is this what's the Lord trying to communicate now God knew exactly how Peter would react which is why he presented it the way he did so that Peter would understand how to solve the riddle back to acts 11 I said not so Lord no I've never eaten unclean stuff but the voice answered me again from Heaven what God hath cleansed that call not thou common profane polluted dirty Peter I can make the unclean clean think of the woman at the well a Samaritan think of Rahab get out of the box Peter I transcend the box it isn't about eating I'm saying that to get your attention Peter that's a metaphor I'm using it's about things that are clean and things that are dirty and this was done three times and all were drawn up again unto heaven and and acts 10 tells us it appears pondering this Lord what does this mean what what are you trying to say and by the way it's lunchtime and I'm hungry and behold Peter goes on behold he's telling his audience behold pay attention listen to me this is important immediately not eventually there were three men already come into the house of Simon the Tanner where I was sent from caesarea unto me caesarea that symbol of Roman oppression and occupation a symbol of Gentile power a place of pagan temples it's a it's it's and here's a person it will a portion rather of the Imperial Army is stationed there to remind everybody who's in charge and the spirit made me go with them nothing doubting even though one of these men was a Roman soldier I'm sure Peter's thinking boy am I in trouble again oops oops oops sorry Lord nothing doubting moreover these six Brethren Peter's again talking and he's got six guys with him these six Brethren from Joppa who have come with me to Jerusalem and are now here is witnesses to back up what I'm relating to you they accompanied me to caesarea and we all seven of us entered into the man's house the man who had sent the three to fetch me from Joppa and he that's Cornelius the man the the Roman captain of the Italian Brigade stationed in caesarea to remind everybody who's in charge showed us how he had seen an angel in a vision in his house which stood and said unto him send men to Joppa call for Simon who's known as Peter whose surname is Peter who shall tell the words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved actually that's only part of what the angel told Cornelius let's go back to acts 10. I I I I I love this and I just want to share it with you acts 10 5. so this is the angel in the vision talking to Cornelius and says and now not later Cornelius make haste now send men to Joppa and call for send forth invite one Simon whose surname is Peter here's the additional detail he's lodging with one Simon a Tanner whose house is by the seaside and he shall tell thee what thou ought us to do can you imagine have you ever had the Lord speak to you like that I I've never had him speak directly to be like that here's here's here's there's like eight very precise things going on here Cornelius don't you go send men send them to Joppa 35 or 40 miles away that's going to take a couple of days to get there in a couple of days to get back look for a guy whose name is Simon but goes by Peter and he doesn't live there by the way he's visiting so you better not dilly dally or he might move on and he's not staying in an inn but with another guy who also happens to be named Simon this Heather Simon is a Tanner by trade but if you have read anything about how they process leather in that period of time you'd know that you're sending your men to a very smelly Place rich with odor it's really bad they I don't want to tell you what they use it it it it no fortunately this house is by the seaside so there's breezes that'll help a little bit without odor and and and Simon that's known as Peter will tell you what you need to do this is an answer to your prayer or prayers this has been going on for a long time we don't know exactly what cornelius's prayer was but we know that Simon Peter was going to bring him the answer to those birds God's not going to speak to him directly he's going to speak to him through somebody and and you're going to have to if Simon's going to tell you this and he's in Joppa you got to bring him he's got to be willing to come with you all the way back up to caesarea that's a lot of very specific conditions very specific instructions for the guys that you send they're going to go to Simon the Tanners but call for Simon Peter skipping down just a little bit here verse 17 in Acts 10. now while Peter doubted himself with this Vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house that is Simon the Tanner excuse me can you tell me where where a Tanner named Simon lives oh you know oh yes sir oh oh you go go down the shore road yeah oh oh okay yeah oh oh oh okay you see you say I can't miss him I just once I get there I just follow my nose oh okay so they got there and stood before the gates and called and asked whether Simon not the Tanner the owner of the house they were told to call for Simon Peter so they asked whether Simon which was surname Peter was a guest was lodged there right the detail the specificity of it back to Acts 11. Peter says as soon as I began to speak now Peter's leaving out something I I think I think let's go back to acts 10 for just a moment as I began to speak it says then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God's no respect to her persons in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him Peter then goes on to share the gospel message but look at verse 34. Peter's addressing a small crowd in this house can any of you speak loud enough to address a crowd without opening your mouth [Music] no I have to open my mouth then why does Luke specifically tell us that Peter opened his mouth Cornelius had just finished relating to Peter this very detailed instruction that he received from the angel in the vision the reason why they were gathered and not only that they were gathered but with an attitude to fully accept whatever Peter said as being direct from the Throne of the almighty himself personally I think when Peter heard that and saw the attentiveness of these people that Peter opened his mouth his jaw dropped in amazement his first words expressed that surprise even shock of a truth it's true God is no respecter of person wow back to Acts 11. as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us as being the same way it did on us in the beginning well how did that happen in the beginning in Acts 2. I hope the binding's not wearing out under Bible flipping back and forth here Acts 2 verse 4 and they gathered in the upper room were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues in other languages as the spirit gave him utterance and they were dwelling of Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under Heaven this is the Feast of Shavuot of Pentecost it's one of the three times that the Jewish people make a pilgrimage specifically to Jerusalem so there was a crowd there of devout Jews yes from all over the Eastern Mediterranean the Middle East that part of the world every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad and that doesn't mean you know some Newsboy on the street corner saying extra extra over here is going on these guys are loud the sound coming out of that upper room is louder than the rushing Mighty Wind these people can hear it can you hear what's going on I've come let's find out they they heard that noise this was not a quiet Gathering and the multitude of pilgrims in the area came together and were confounded what because every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled we could say they were astonished saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans they must have retained their distinctive accent and how here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born and Luke goes on to list all sorts of locations and places and languages but what were they hearing in verse 11. we do hear them speak and our language is proclaiming this is loud the wonderful works of God well what was happening in Acts 10 then that Peter's referring to in Acts 11. acts 10 44. while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word so exactly what do you just told these guys in Acts 11. right and now they of the circumcision which believed in other words these six guys that came from Joppa with Peter were astonished that sounds just like Acts 2 just like the crowd near David's tomb in Acts 2 6. as many as came with Peter and why were they astonished because it on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift gift we we read in an earlier part of Acts where a guy was trying to buy this gift and Peter said no it's not for sale this is God God's Sovereign decision God chooses to give but like any gift you have to receive it you have you can accept it or you can reject it he's not forcing it that's the Free Will part of the transfer poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost which these Jewish Believers recognized how did they recognize it for they Peter's group heard them cornelius's group speak with tongues and what are they saying their words did magnify God they heard just like that original crowd and Acts 2 Peter had some people with him that spoke language different than the people in Cornelius as crowd spoke that was the speaking in tongues hearing the Praises of god let's get back to Peter's report in Acts 11 or I will have you here till 10 o'clock acts 11 16 then remembered I this is Peter speaking then I remembered the word of the Lord how that he Jesus said John indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost and now I I suspect this is just me that Peter must have spread out his arms and Shrugged his shoulders and said just like he and John had said to the Sanhedrin they'd been called on the carpet some weeks or months before as much then as God gave them the gift we didn't give it God did as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could withstand God and how will these Jewish Believers these ones that started out contending with Peter Peter about this report of Peter hanging out with Gentiles and so forth how are they going to respond is there going to be that Schism are they going to say Peter your vision was all wet we don't care what happened afterwards you're off the word brother was there a Breaking of Fellowship when they who were contenting with Peter heard these things heard the testimony heard the full story not just the rumors not just the scuttlebutt to help their peace and that doesn't mean well they bit their tongue no no no they held their Shalom their literal peace that comes from God they were satisfied and not only that but they glorified God they weren't just biting their tongue they were happy saying then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life maybe their jaws dropped too they're happy campers the gospel was spreading not only to Jews and Samaritans and proselytes but even further to the Gentiles when when I think of Cornelius or Peter ventrangatra Cornelius that was a big step I'm reminded of the words of Neil Armstrong it's one small step for a man a giant leap for mankind in this case for the church the Artesian well of the Gospel isn't just a bubbling spring it's a geyser Jesus said in John 4 14 whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up and to everlasting life well the stage is now set for the widespreading of the Gospel we'll see this begin when we get to Acts chapter 13. but now Luke wants to lay some more Foundation he steps back in time to tell of another thrust of evangelism let's continue on in Acts 11. what I'll call part two now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen so we're all the way back now to that time when Philip went into Samaria and so forth traveled as far as Venus well that's not this town 100 miles to the north that we're glad we don't live in but it's phenicia it's it's modern day Lebanon and Cyprus and Antioch preaching the word of God to none but unto the Jews only it's time for a little more geography so this map is overlaid with modern modern countries if you if you can't read what it says that's a hint that you should sit closer to the front um so we have here Jerusalem Jaffa caesarea which we just read about now they say the gospel has gone to Cyprus this rather large island right here phenicia Lebanon and as far as Antioch which is right up here in kind of between Syria and turkey where the where the Mediterranean stops heading north and starts heading back West I just also wanted to point out that when it talks about people from Cyrene that cyrenia that's way over here that's North Africa modern day Libya it's quite some distance and there's Tarsus where Paul was originally from so you've you've got that in your mind now I'm sure that it's imprinted and memorized and whatever these towns are mentioned you're going to know exactly where they are in their relationship to each other here I've I've zoomed in just just a little bit to show you again Antioch and uh Tarsus were Paul's from and here's Cyprus and this little inset map gives you a better idea there's a coin up here where some guy's face on it we'll talk about that in just a moment because I want to give you not just some geography but some historical context so think about this in Acts 10 the gospel first went to the Gentiles in caesarea a City built by Herod the Great and named honor Augustus Caesar a symbol of Gentile dominance of Roman oppression in Israel I don't know about you but it brings a smile to my face when I think about it caesarea is the location God chooses to First demonstrate the power of the Gospel to the proud gentiles well what about Antioch why would a city be named Antioch flashback Alexander the Great Macedonia conquered the Middle East and Beyond and then in 323 BC he died his Empire was carved up into four pieces in the eastern part of it was taken over and became what's known as the solicit Empire Antioch city was named after a guy named there's various ways that you can pronounce this we we probably think of it as Antiochus epiphanies I think it's actually Antiochus epiphanis but we'll call it Antiochus epiphanies he's an early powerful King of the seleucid empire it was a descendant of his Antiochus the fourth epiphanies the man whose image is on the coin he ruled from about 175 to 164 BC and he's the guy that tried to really Force hellenization down the throat of the people living in what we think of as Israel resulting in a pig being slaughtered on the altar in Jerusalem that triggered the maccabean revolt and Independence in some form or other for the Israelite Nation from about 140 BC until 63 BC when a guy named Herod took over under the stewardship of Rome so Antioch is a symbol of hellenization of forcing Greek culture along with its values philosophies and pagan gods so where does the gospel story in Acts go immediately after caesarea Antioch I think God has a wonderful if subtle sense of humor well reading on and some of them those scattered from Jerusalem were men of Cyprus that we just saw that Island on the map and cyrini which we saw as part of Libya which when they were come to Antioch spake unto the grecians these are the hellenized Jews verse 19 made it clear that they were only talking to Jewish people practitioners of Judaism they were preaching the Lord Jesus and we're told the hand of the Lord was with them a great number believed and turned unto the Lord after a great number that implies that there's a significant Jewish population in Antioch well when Tidings that just simply means news of these things of which things that the gospel was being widely accepted in these regions Cyprus and phenicia and especially Antioch came unto the ears of the church was in Jerusalem they the Church of Jerusalem sent forth Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch remember this chapter opened with the church in Jerusalem asking Peter about what they'd heard well here they heard about these successes and spreading the gospel to the north they wanted to verify what they heard and they wanted to help so they didn't Google it they sent a trusted representative Barnabas who's Barnabas Barnabas is going to play a big part in things in a few chapters or for a few chapters recall from Acts 4. Barnabas was from the island of Cyprus that's one of the places where this gospel is being spread and what do we read and Joseph who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite he's from the the Priestly the you know the tribe of Levi and of the country of Cyprus having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet and and there's something important about brought the money we'll we'll get to that in in just uh just a few moments here get back to Acts 11. who when he came that is when Barnabas came to Antioch and had seen the grace of God the acceptance of the Gospel the spread of the good news the infilling of the Holy Spirit was glad glad what they had heard about in Jerusalem was true and he exhorted he encouraged them all that with purpose of heart that means with an open heart an honest heart they would cleave they would endear they would remain steadfast unto the Lord for Barnabas was a good man full of the Holy Ghost full of faith and much people was added unto the Lord he wasn't disruptive he was encouraging helping putting his shoulder to the wheel then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for to seek Saul showing here Antioch Tarsus why would he be going to seek Saul we heard earlier that Saul was a powerful witness for the gospel powerful wind so he's going there to seek his help get him involved in the work in Antioch but why is he looking for him in Tarsus we know that's where he was born but why would he go to Tarsus well I'm sure you remember from acts 9 but I'll give you a reminder acts 9 26 when Saul who had just escaped from Damascus was come to Jerusalem he is saved he tried he attempted to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him believe not that he was a disciple but Barnabas took Saul and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how Saul had seen the Lord in the way and that the Lord had spoken to Saul and how solid preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus there's a connection with Barnabas and with Saul and he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus disputed against the hellenized Jews but they weren't about to kill him which when the Brethren knew they brought Saul down to caesarea busy Port ships and sent him forth to Tarsus so Barnabas knows that Saul was sent to Tarsus so he's going to go to Tarsus to look for him back to Acts 11. and when Barnabas had found Saul he brought him to Antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they Saul and Barnabas assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called Christians first and Antioch there was a lot going on they stayed there for a year they were getting results and now we come to part three and in these days toward the end of that whole year came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch and there stood up one of them one of the prophets that came from Jerusalem named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be a great dearth the root of the word dearth is from destitution applying hunger or famine throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar now it's not clear when this prophecy occurred the reference to the reign of cloudius May indicate the prophecy came during the reign of Antigua the previous Emperor or it may indicate the prophecy came to pass while Claudius was still on the throne we don't really know and then the disciples that is the Christians in Antioch every man according to his ability determined to send relief money a collection unto their brethren which dwalted judeo which also they did and sent it to the elders in Jerusalem by the hands of Barnabas and Saul well we recall from acts 4 that we just read that Barnabas sold land and put the proceeds of the work to the church he demonstrated that he could be trusted with the finances they didn't have to worry about him pilfering any of it if they took up a collection for Jerusalem take it down Barnabas is a guy you can trust with your money we're sending it with Barnabas and they're sending it with Saul now unlike the directions given to Cornelius or or Joseph's dream interpretation of the seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine in Egypt the prophecy of agabus is vague a great dearth throughout all the world the word translated World here is not Cosmos as we might think but but it's a word that means land now there's a widespread interpretation of this prophecy that takes it to mean throughout the entire Roman Empire throughout the entire Mediterranean world and because there is no record of any such famine having occurred throughout the entire Roman world or the Mediterranean World during the reign of Claudius people say see you can't trust the Bible you can't trust acts it's just it's just myth it's just made up it's just whatever mm-hmm but there were certainly Regional famines Regional crop failures Regional problems but I think there's a clue here and that clue solves the riddle and I believe that that then shows the accuracy of both the prophecy and Luke's assertion that it in fact happened consider why did they send Aid to Judea why not to all the churches why not disciples until other places as well Why not start storing up supplies locally for their own use that's what Joseph did was it just because agabus came from Jerusalem and it was a convenient thing to do well any of you that have ever lived in Israel or been there for a significant amount of time you know that in Israel they re people will say that they'll call Israel instead of Israel they'll say audits it means the land it's it's Hebrew and it's taken to mean the land of Israel the Promised Land I think that the disciples in Antioch took agabus prophecy to mean this as opposed to the entire Roman Empire or wherever their concept might have been of the planet Earth thus there will be a Great Famine throughout all the land not all the world all the land to agabus and the Jewish Christians they'd understand this to mean Judea and the surrounding area hence send relief to Judea but we read the English version of it all the world and we think planet Earth we think the Mediterranean we think the Roman Empire not the context of these people people in this time and that famine did occur during the reign of Claudius and about 44 or 45 A.D well apart from the geography the reaction of the faithful to that prophecy shows concern and care for The Wider Church body some of you were probably thinking that's a nice history and context lesson brother Lyle but really what does it have to do with me in Tucson in 2023 some 1980 years after these events the musicians would please return oh it's well before 10 30. first the attitude of those that confronted Peter they didn't hide they didn't talk behind his back when they had the opportunity they confronted him with what they had heard Peter is this true when presented with the evidence with the testimony with a story they were willing to be flexible they realized they'd only heard part of the story they withheld judgment and then they rejoiced rather than condemned when it was explained what should we do when we hear something about someone that bothers us raises the question another is Peter's attitude towards them patient explanation rather than rejection or dismissal he carefully related the events leading up to the problem you ate with gentiles he laid a foundation he gave the background he established the context he shared with respect these are his brothers these are his sisters they have a question let's discuss this let's not argue about it and when he was done he asked them how would they respond what can I do God poured out his holy spirit it wasn't me argument achieves nothing sharing and responding and a respectful non-confrontational manner should be our heart working together holding one another up before the Lord being flexible without sacrificing the basic tenets of our faith recognizing we're all in different places along our path to our final goal of being united with Christ forever as we sang that opening songs I came up here not putting God in a box or insisting that our perspective is the right one or the only valid one being sensitive to the spirit having compassion on others without being patronizing sharing the witness of Jesus Christ I wonder if we could sing as brother Aaron comes to close a service I want to live the way he wants me to live [Music] I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more I could never never out I want to live away [Music] I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just I never love us one more time I'm going to live in the way I'm going to give until there's just no more to him I'm going to love until then [Music] I could never [Music] I am answers amen sometimes if you're not careful you just look at it as history what happened but if you can bring it up to present life what I'm going through realize that God's mercy rewrote my life too not just a history but he's still the same yesterday sometimes he has to send somebody your way to get your attention I and say hey do you really believe it is it the truth is that and then you can just wanted to to share this with you with our brother you know I said be yourself that's the best way to be yourself because that's who you are so I asked him I said did you empty yourself did you leave everything here and he says they were quiet they were quiet but boy did they drain me took everything he said I left it here so I appreciate God sending our brother in a different way than maybe we might have fought or anticipated I shared his heart and we took them to lunch and I said I'm not going to take you to eat Mexican food because New Mexico Mexican food is far better than here so we went to eat we all sat down and I don't know why they picked on our brother but they didn't serve him we're reminded The Waitresses he hasn't got is what we were all done eating and they still had not served him finally brought his food he was the most patient understanding never complained he said it's coming it'll be all right I learned a lesson they that weighed upon the Lord shall receive their food [Music] it's been good to be in the house of the Lord today I believe the Lord has blessed us on Wednesday evening brother Daniel will still be out of town and he asked me to minister play a tape and he mentioned which tape it would be so we'll see how the Lord leads us I'm working on something sometimes the day goes real long on Wednesday the Lord knows what what we will do so if you'll stand I appreciate the fact and brother Danielle asked me if I would take one of the chapters of Acts and I said I can't do what you Brothers do that's just not me I would appreciate that they would do it how they see it and but it takes a lot of work study the time and I appreciate brother Lyle and brother Daniel doing

[Music] it's such a blessing to to read your scripture Lord and and the way the scriptures come alive like that and we get to take a peek into what things were like when the gospel was first poured out on on first Israel and then continue to spread like that Lord and we even see how they were just humans just with their faults and failures just like we have and we're reminded of some of the squabbles that we see and unfortunately partake in Lord you forgave them Lord forgive us for when we get caught up in things like that and maybe we get caught up in and we fail to draw the circle bigger like brother Branham always continue to tell us to do he had a way of putting his arm around a brother that maybe they didn't see things quite the same but I don't think that that matters so much to you Lord it's just the relationship that each one has with you Lord we're sure thankful for those around us and you can get it's tough to get warmed by a candle but what each person is bringing their little look of fire together we can sure get warmed around a bonfire Lord and we have you to thank for that think for all the things that were said and we want to tell you that we love you Lord and we just ask that you would pull us up real close to you lead us in goddesses only you can as we go about the this upcoming week we just ask that as we walk away with our little look of fire maybe it would allow someone else that's around us to see a little bit more clear maybe Shine the the gospel I in our own lives in our own little way Lord Jesus [Music] and we pray amen [Music] I
