today looks stable and tomorrow it's gone what's happening in the Middle East from one day to the next changes so quickly but he's the same yesterday today and forever so have some requests I missed a couple of services don't know really what it was was but it left me weak not much energy no no strength and the whole right side of my body was just congested and all and because there's only two of us working we had to work work through that but he's still our healer he doesn't change no matter what happens in this earth and if on this this planet if you're reading the news and paying attention it just seems like one thing after another continually but my hope is in the Lord amen it's um it it's something that probably we take for granted at times the fact that he knows us and we know him and there are those who don't know him he knows everyone but they don't know him by the grace of we God by grace of God we have we have a praise from Sister Melia and uh I appreciate the Praises because it's giving testimony of what God has done and you know I uh I did something I'd never done before this past week in fact it took 65 years to do it we turned 65 and um I've had I've had quite a few warnings of the things that began to happen after that and they're true but I asked my daughter Abby I said how how do old do the kids think I am and Chloe said 40 and of course 40 is old to them and Asher I thought he said 25 and I said well they got it right and she goes no he said 45 so I made it 85 but I thank the god I thank God for life and for health and and uh the privilege to live this long and to come I believe closer to that day that it'll all be over and it'll be worth it all from Sister Amelia she says thank you Lord I usually I usually know when a blessing is on the way from the way people treat me during the week I cried and sighed and and hoped for better days then I come to Wednesday night service and receive blessings that leave me in awe I love the Lord with all my heart and know that he always is mindful of me I love you all with a Godly love and pray that God will bless you all as he continues to bless me thank you for your prayers and for being mindful of me sister Amelia and you know when one part of the body suffers the rest of the body suffers so it's just good to have a praise [Music] um so would you kind to note the it 10 west is shut down so there are some who are stuck in traffic jam you know and sometimes we can get angry about it but there's reason for everything yeah okay you just you might sit there for an extra 20 minutes on in the freeway and yeah that's aggravating but maybe take some time to thank the Lord and pray and and give him glory and watch the 20 minutes go by quickly still 20 minutes whether you're angry or not but when you're angry they seem to go 40 or 50 yeah that's kind of strange how that works from Sister Zyra asked prayer for her uncle unspoken request She also asked prayer for her stepfather's daughter-in-law she was diagnosed with thyroid [Music] cancer brother Ed is asking us to remember sister Kathy dugall in prayer she's not feeling good and needs a touch from the Master's Hand and also her for Lance their grandson to remember him in [Music] prayer and then my daughter Sarah yesterday was went to for dialysis and the if you saw it on the the system went down at the dialysis center and uh they were told they would not be able to dilize till Monday and when your carrying a lot of fluid that that gets very difficult and um so she went to uh St Mary's Hospital they have a dialysis center there and they told her to wait they might be able to get her in and she ended up spending the night there and they when to di dialight her this morning things we take for granted that our body just does what it does but when the body doesn't work we suffer and so just asking him uh prayer for her and my wife who spent a lot of time with her yesterday and and just uh as a mom your heart just breaks for them as a dad sometimes you say well life has got to go on and I got to do this and take care of that but Mom just seems to drop everything and goes and help so remember her amen from Sister Barbara Y please pray for my son Joseph his wife Ellen and extended family Thursday morning alen's brother was killed instantly in a fatal car accident he was 41 years old a police officer of nearly 20 years and left behind a loving wife three young children and many gving family members their hearts are broken and they are all in shock at this time and when when we go through something or hear something like that and we can be touched and we can reach out as part of the family but even more so him see he was wounded he was broken he was pierced he was hated he was lied about so when you go to him and say father do you understand he says yes I've been there and he can be touched by the filling of our infirmities Lord as we we bow our heads and Lord and some Sunday mornings there's a lot of praises and and testimonies and and on some Sundays Lord there's a lot of requests because because we need you Lord especially sister yarbro's son and that side of his wife's family Lord what a what a loss maybe if if in in in sometimes as as as we lose a loved one and it takes a period of time it it allows us to adjust and to expect it but when something suddenly happens Lord and and it it's a shock it's hard but Lord You Can Be Touched By The Filling of our infirmities the words of God says you you you took yourself and you took a body that could be feel what we feel and you could understand our our need Lord and then when you look to see was there a worthy lamb that could be sacrificed to make amends to bring the healing there was none you were the only worthy one so you said I'll take a stand in their place and we thank you for that Lord Lord would you meet every heart's desire every need today Lord especially this family that just lost one tragically Lord we commit it to you Lord and as they take the offering Lord may be a cheerful Giver Lord and be Ed Lord as you desire to be Lord and it's good to be in the house of the Lord today in Jesus Christ's name amen you can

[Music] James chapter 3: 6 it reads like this and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that defileth the whole body and Seth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell for the very kind of beasts and birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth prede blessings and cursings my brethren these

you were with us on Wednesday and uh and all the visitors we have I see a couple back there I don't recognize welcome it's we appreciate having you brother Alex right God bless you good to see you again um this uh this next chapter in James so we've been going through the Book of James we obviously started with chapter one and and we're continuing on and uh today we fall on chapter three and chapter three I'm I guess I'm glad to say that it hasn't affected any of us here and none of us have ever had a problem with with this tongue that is mentioned in chapter 3 um it is something that is just so evolent in the world today I was I was up praying the other day was praying about uh the word and and Lord what do you want me to bring bring forth and as I was up in the in the Catalina mountains where I go many times to try to get alone try to get quiet before the Lord way back up in there and I'm praying and it's just a beautiful day just the sun is just perfect everything the the temperature was about 60° it was just I was just so thankful just thanking the lord for what he's done done for us and as I was praying and asking the Lord uh some things I heard a kind of a rustle and uh it was there's a there's so I sit up on a rock there's a big open Rock and there's a a canyon below me and then on the other side of the canyon it goes all the way up to uh to M Mount Lemon really and I I just love to just sit there and just look at the mountain and that Canyon below me started hearing some rustling going on down there and and I thought what is that it's just a just a faint noise so I got up and and I uh tried to kind of follow I'd sit there and I'd listen listen listen listen and then I'd hear another little rustle and and finally I I made my way along the cliff to overlook this area and it was a herd of Havalina and if you've ever seen a Havalina they are without a doubt the ugliest animal in the entire desert but this mama Havalina she had a baby with her and that thing was about this big and it was in between her her feet and even an ugly Havalina baby is so cute and I was looking down at that thing thinking man that is a that thing is really really cute but Mama is just so ugly and I I was I was watching those and just enjoying it and they they were kind of moving around and and i' just I'd hear them woof a little bit here and there and uh just enjoying it and and I heard somebody told me and I've tried this many times and I got the same result as every other time I've tried it I heard that if you woof like a havina that they'll come up closer to you so I uh gave my best woof woof and I must have said something offensive and Havish they they all took off running and uh and and they you know they made a little bit more ra more Ruckus and and then they were gone so I went back I made one my way back through the Rocks back to my place of prayer and I started praying again and uh soon after I started hearing voices and crunching walking and it gradually became louder and louder and I actually heard as there was an Australian accent from a woman's voice and and they get louder and louder and louder and they're still way way out there and and then they come around and and there's a trail that goes up at the base of the mountain and and they came into sight and I could see it was three women and and they were going along and and the one was talking about her mother-in-law and and with an a she had an Australian accent and the other one was talking about something else and and they they kept walking along and pretty soon I could hear there they were a couple hundred yards away but I could hear their conversation just as plain as as they and they're walking and and they and they um they eventually go across the mountains and and they're gone and I compared these women to these Havalina and and I thought a human being makes so much noise I could hear them coming a long way out and if if they weren't talking it would be the Stomping but those Havalina they were just right below me and I could just barely hear them and it was just thinking how nature and how James we we read earlier uh in a previous lesson on James James said be quick to hear and slow to speak and slow to wrath and these Havalina as I was up on the up on the hill watching down they would they would walk and and they'd eat around and they were always listening always listening for a predator or always listening for their babies or always listening for another of their group to make sure they were together and seeing how even nature it displays God's word that these Havalina they were quick to hear but they were slow to speak very quiet if they would have been like like us I mean they would just be quick Qui a quick meal for a mountain lion or for a bear or or or for a coyoty but instead they're quiet and they can get right up on top of you and you never know that they're there and then they're also there slow to wrath you know you hear stories about Havalina but they didn't turn and come fight me when I said whatever I said offensive to them they they just went they just took off and went their way thinking how nature it reflects on God's word when I would when I would take our kids out we' spend a lot of time out in the woods when they were young and I'd always tell them just listen listen just stop don't talk and let's have some quiet time let's get out in the woods or wherever we were and just listen and you will hear things that You' never knew were even there you'll hear birds and you'll hear squirrels and you'll hear the wind blowing through the pine trees and you'll hear a pine cone fall or or you'll hear the the leaves rattling we need to listen and we also need to be careful in our words and that's how this third chapter of James is he is telling us watch what you say remember James is a pastor of a church he was the half brother of the Lord Jesus he was the pastor of the the first and the biggest Christian church right there in Jerusalem so he knew all of the problems and it wasn't his in his epistle it wasn't meant to introduce him to the Lord Jesus they're like us they've already been introduced to the Lord they just needed correction they needed to grow in the Lord and that's what James is doing here and he's showing them that hey our words that we say they have power and they're very very important they um we think of the Gospel of John and he starts his gospel with in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God saying that if we are made in the image of God if God is his word then are we our words if we're made in him his image do our words Define us as God's word defines him I believe it's in 114 he says and the Word was made flesh it became real and it dwelt among us and if we're made in the image of God we are what we say we are our words we're constantly talking about about the power of the word and and you say oh just believe the word brother just just listen to the word sister just just just take the word as it is but we have to remember that this word it has such power power but it has power coming out of our mouths also our words are powerful the Bible says in Hebrews it says the word of God is quick and it's powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword that's the word of God but the words of mankind are also a sword and they can be used in defense or they can be used to attack and there they very very powerful no matter no matter how you see it and especially in today's world and we'll get to this everyone everyone in this building has great power in their words you have power to do great damage and you have power to do great good every person I'm talking about man woman and child I want to read a few quotes to you from different people um this uh a woman named Shannon Alder she read she she said this a coward talks to everyone but you Frank a Clark says gossip needing to be false to be evil there's a lot of truth that shouldn't be passed around Earl Wilson says gossip is when you hear something you like about someone you don't Joel Olstein says if you can't if you can't be positive then at least be quiet a Spanish proverb said whoever gossips to you will gossip about you Eleanor Roosevelt said great minds discuss ideas average Minds discuss events and small minds discuss people Leonard Ravenhill says notice we never pray for folks we gossip about and we never gossip about the folk for whom we pray for prayer is a great deterrent amen what the same man wrote this what good does it do to speak in tongues on Sunday if you have been using your tongue during the week to curse and to gossip Thomas Watson says this God has given us two years but one tongue to show that we should be swift to hear but slow to speak God has set a double fence before the tongue teeth and lips to teach us to be wary that we offend not with our tongue so your tongue just if you keep your mouth closed you got a double Fortress there between your teeth and your lips Joseph Hall says this there would not be so many many open mouths if there were not so many open ears Charles Spurgeon says if there were no gratified hearers of ill reports there would be an end of the trade of spreading them Charles Spurgeon also said this the best way to deal with slander is to pray about it God will either remove it or remove the Sting from it our own attempt at clearing ourselves are usually failures we are like the boy who wished to remove the blot from his copy and by his bungling made it 10 times worse you know I I related with what Charles Spurgeon says there is when I was a kid little kid in in in kindergarten we'd color you know they'd give you the sheets of of paper and You' get your crayons and you color and man I could not stay in the lines and I don't know if I would just couldn't focus or I was looking around but but I always you know i' I'd be coloring and then right outside the line and I think oh man I messed up right there so what I would do is I would make a big blot where I where I got out of the lines and so it' be a rabbit or whatever it was and this rabbit would have this big thing coming out the side of his head and my teacher would always say why do you do that and I'd say oh well I got out of the lines right there and she'd say don't do that just try to stay in lines if you get out just just leave it there Martin Luther said you are not only responsible for what you say but also for what you don't say Frederick Robertson said you may tame the wild beast which we were going to get through talk about this in the Book of James you may tame the wild beast the conf flager of the forest will cease when all the Timber and the dry wood are consumed but you cannot arrest the progress of that cruel word which you uttered carelessly yesterday or this morning Martin Van B says if your foot slips you may recover your balance but if your tongue slips you cannot recall your words Theodore I have a few more Theodore EP says perhaps we have been guilty of speaking against someone and have not realized how it may have hurt them then when someone speaks against us we suddenly realize how deeply such words hurt and we become sensitive to what we have done I wish that was the case but unfortunately that's usually not the case AB Simpson says I would rather play with a with forked lightning or take in my hand living wires with their fiery current than to speak speak a reckless word against any servant of Christ or idly repeat the slanderous darts which thousands of Christians are hurling on one another Richard Richard Cecil says this if any person to whom you feel dislike if there is any person to whom you feel dislike that is the person of whom you ought to never speak brother brandom says if you you don't have to stick a knife into a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him you can kill his influence brother R also said this adultery is the perversion of a legal act a lie is a perversion of the truth John Calvin said it is a sign of a perverse and treacherous disposition to wound the good name of another when he has no opportunity of defending himself it's more true today I believe in it's ever been John Calvin also said this I consider the looseness with words I consider looseness with words no less of a defect than looseness of the bowels another person also said that the Apostle Paul fir 2 Timothy 3:1 says this this also know no this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous bla boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent the quote from Calvin that I just read incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are a good that word false accusers we think about a lie but it doesn't have to be a Li to qualify as a false accuser you know there's been a real push over the past I don't know 10 20 years to attack some of the founding fathers of our country Thomas Jefferson is one of them Thomas Jefferson they've they've said really horrible things about him saying that he was a slave owner and and and accusing him of having Affairs an affair with with one of his slaves and and many many things accusing this man Thomas Jefferson of and Thomas Jefferson isn't here to defend himself but yet they accuse him of owning slaves every wealthy person back then owned slaves but we try to bring Thomas Jefferson into today and attack him for living in a different age and try to bring him to this age of course if Thomas Jefferson lived in this age he wouldn't be for slavery he wouldn't be for racism he wouldn't be for any of that Thomas Jefferson is the one who wrote the Declaration of Independence and said in the Declaration of Independence all men are created equal and yet we try to pull this man out of history and attack his character really because he lived in a different age and yet he was one of the greatest men but we try to erase history we try to change history and make these people different than they are these this is called a false accusation there's false accusers I mentioned incontinent before that means that word incontinent is without self-control Inc continent is people that today it's people that can't control their bladder or can't control their ba bowels and like the Apostle Paul Calvin says that he considers looseness with words no less of a defect than looseness of the bowels when an opportunity arises to say a negative word and you can't control yourself you think of that incontinence and when you spew out these words there's no cleaning up the mess in this situation your words are already out and you have already already done the damage to both the person that you're talking about and also to your own self you damage your own reputation what I said about earlier the person that's that is gossiping to you is probably gossiping about you we really we understand that subconsciously knowing that this person who's always spreading all of these these rumors and all all of this news this person is probably going to do it about me and when you lose Lo people's faith when you lose people's confidence you develop a reputation for yourself and then the only thing that they're going to share with you is perhaps more gossip and then it goes into this vicious cycle and our words are so they're so important I need some help I want to I want to do a uh I want to do a demonstration Zeke come up come up here for a minute I didn't tell them I need I need you to help me all right man I got you some toothpaste he's he's a single guy all right Zeke the toothpaste inside here all right are your words all right and the tube is your mouth okay so take this all right open your mouth the tube [Laughter] I told you the tub okay all right Zeke so

in your mouth can't do it right here you go these are your words you got to keep your words to you can you can keep the two the same the same with our words brothers and sisters you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube and neither once your words come out neither can you take your words and put them back into your mouth they are out and the Damage that is caused may never stop it may be a rumor it may be something that's true about someone and these words come out of your mouth and they go and they go and they go and they're perpetually in the world like this toothpaste is it can't it can't go back into the tube thanks Zeke 2 Corinthians 12 verse 20 I'm going to read the English Standard Version of this if you can put up the King James Version 2 Corinthians 12 20 for I fear this is the Apostle Paul addressing the people at Corinth the Church of Corinth and he says this for I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish and that you may find me not as you wish that perhaps there may be quarreling and jealousy and anger and hostility and slander and gossip and conceit and disorder I fear that when I come again my my God May humble me before you and that I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of impurity and sexual immorality and sens and sensuality that they have practiced so Paul is saying that that when I come back to you to the church he said I'm afraid that I'm going to find this toothpaste out of the tube he says I'm afraid that I'm going to find quarrel in and jealousy and slander and gossip and he says when I come he says I'm afraid that I fear that I'm going to find things not as I want them to and when I come and I see this you're going to find that you're not going to appreciate me either because I'm going to set these things straight he comes and he the Apostle Paul's warning them listen when I come when I get there you you need to have these things straight I taught you taught you not to be talking about each other I taught you not to be fighting with each other but then you go and do it when Jesus Christ returns as Paul was returning to this Corinthian Church when Jesus Christ returns is he going to find toothpaste all over the place is he going to find all of the problems is he going to find all of the slander is he going to find all of the talking about each other is he going to find all of the fighting is he going to find all of this is he going to find all of our differences right out there for everyone to see and I ask our differen is really that important that we would separate those who claim the name of Jesus Christ and we would separate ourselves from them think about your doctrines think about our doctrines baptism and dress and music and Bible translations and denominations and churches and pastors and Prophets and Unwritten rules are they enough to separate us when Jesus Christ returns are we going to say Lord I separated from those people that claim you there's a brother told me one time I was ministering on Unity I was ministering on this type of thing which is one of my common subjects that I Minister on and he says he says well brother Daniel he says what separates us from the Baptist church across the street my answer is what why do you want to be separated is there something that is more important to you to divide yourself from another Christian that when Jesus returns you are going to say I'm not part of them John Chapter 13 Jesus said a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you and that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have loved one for another he didn't say by this I will know you he said that a different time but he says by by this all other men will know that you're my disciples because because of your love one for another he didn't say your gossip he didn't say your doctrines he didn't say your church he didn't say those things he said that you should love one another and by this other people will know that you're a Christian other people will know that you are my disciple and our difference enough our our differen is enough to put down other Christian churches Baptist and Nazarene and the mega churches and whatever it is I was careful to put quotes from all kinds of different Christian pastors than what I just read whatever it is is it enough to say that they're not with us they're not part of us and there is there's a Baptist church across the street am I going to say no Jesus I'm not part of them because of what because of doctrines or am I going to say no I'm with them they believe in Jesus Christ and him crucified they believe in the holy spirit of God we may disagree on certain things but we are together in Christ and that's not even mentioning the Ridiculousness of of how we in our circles separate ourselves I don't want even go there there Ephesians 4 verse 29 says this let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace to the hearer edifying is building up so he says let nothing come out of your mouth that is not building up but how many times does things come out of our mouth in in the defense or or attacking others how many times do things things come out of our mouths that are tearing people down no matter if they deserve it or not he didn't say if they deserve it or not you can't put once we say it as I said you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube now look at this next verse that is a very strong warning and grieve not Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption these things this talking and this fighting and he's saying these things they grieve away the holy spirit of God they drive him away let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice too let it all be put away with away from you and be kind one to to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you James 1:26 says if a man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain there's this kind of like the Hall of Shame sh is what I'm calling it this morning in Proverbs the seven things that God hates we're all familiar with this scripture Proverbs 6:1 16 these seven things that God hates and as I read them I want you to take note of how many things that God hates that relate to our tongue and what we say Proverbs 6:16 these six things that the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him an Abomination is Extreme disgust Now watch how many of these things have to do with our words verse 17 these thing these these six thing does the Lord hate y seven an abomination in him a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift in running to Mischief the ones who are always in the middle of a controversy is what this is talking about they run to the conflict because they want to put their opinion in disgusts God that's three a false witness that speaks lies four and he that SWS Discord among Brethren five of the seven things in this Hall of shame that God hates these are way up at the top the seven things that God hates seven they're an Abomination to him they make him sick they disgust him five of them are created with the tongue are fighting so the one scripture that we see that God hates the most piled all together all of them we can commit every day you ask yourself have you have you said a negative word about someone today and today Satan has made a way for our foolishness and our negative talking he's made a way for it to just go out even more than it ever has through social media now everybody wants everybody wants to have a say everybody wants to be an expert everybody wants to get their voice out and when they do so it just spreads the toothpaste just splatters it everywhere Jude I'm gonna get back to that when we get to James I gotta hurry um Jude the author of the The epistle Jude is probably the brother of James we're in James and the half another half brother of Jesus so this is another one that's feeling the same thing Jude Jude writes this um verse 8 the book of Jude I'll read the new King James version uh Jude 8 likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh reject Authority and speak evil of dignitaries Yet Michael the Archangel in contending with the devil when he disputed about the body of Moses dared not to bring against him a reviling accusation but said the Lord rebuke you so what's he talking about there so Moses we know that he died up on the mountain but we don't know what happened to his body we don't know where he was buried he didn't have a tomb and here is the Archangel Michael and he is disputing face to face with Satan with the devil and he didn't bring an accusation against the devil he didn't go talk behind his back he didn't go spread rumors about the devil he didn't even speak the the truth about the devil outside of what he said face to face and he said the Lord rebuke you for what you're saying now there was probably all this going on about where Moses was or if Moses raised from the dead or if he didn't and all of these these fightings that were going on all these doctrinal differences here we have Michael two angels Michael and Satan and they're fighting and even then the Archangel Michael against the most evil being that has ever been here even he didn't speak evil against evil incarnate or evil made real is is Satan but these speak evil talking about these other people talking about all of us really but these speak evil of whatever they do not know and whatever they know naturally like brute brute beasts in these things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and have run greedily in the air of balum for profit and perished in the rebellion of Kora it says right here they don't understand so they're speaking evil against it and by doing that they corrupt themselves they have gone the way of Cain and what did Cain do he murdered his brother what do we know that you can murder someone by speaking evil against them by spreading a rumor by by killing their influence and that's what Cain did he murdered him in the flesh but we can murder him in life destroy his reputation words our words Express the hatred that's inside of us James chapter 3 verse one James was a pastor remember my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation the new King James says my brethren let not many of you become teachers knowing that we receive a stricter judgment why is that why does a pastor or a minister why does he receive a stricter judgment why does he need to be more careful with his words rather than the the the L it's because his words carry more more weight I'm speaking to 150 people or so right now and that's it it's holding weight and that's more weight than oneon-one both are still very very important but today through social media through Facebook and Instagram and YouTube YouTube videos we can go out and we can attack someone get our words out there and now we are more responsible because we have a bigger audience that's any of us have to be so careful in what we say James right here is saying that you're more responsible you pastors and every Pastor really should read James 3:1 everyone that wants to be a minister listen you're going to be judged higher than than anyone else because of your ministry and now we see the voice of the people is rising up and if if you are an influencer you are going to be judged higher too because you are influencing more people a pastor is an influencer a minister is an influencer just like all of these people that you see on YouTube they're trying to get their point across for in many things verse number two for in many things we have all we stumble in many things we make mistakes if a man offend not in word if he doesn't stumble in his words the same as a perfect man and able also to Bridle the whole body so if you're able to hold your tongue especially if you're someone with influence whether that's a pastor or whoever it is then you are able to control every aspect of your life behold we put bits in the horse's mouths and they that they may obey us and we turn about their entire body when I was um when I was younger we always had horses and I rode a lot and many times I would just throw a halter on the horse and get out and and and ride the horse around but when it was important when I had to have control over the horse I put a bit in its mouth and that bit made it to where that horse had to obey me because that bit when you turn them to the left or to the right if they go against you it will press on their gums and it will force them to go and that's how it is with with our tongue is what he's saying is if if you can just Bridle that tongue then you can move the whole body behold also the ships which though they be great and are driven with Fierce winds yet they are turned about with a very small Helm whatsoever the governor listen so whoever's driving the boat he can take this giant ship and then there's one Rudder that's tied into that steering wheel and as he turns it doesn't matter if it's a giant barge out in the open out in the ocean that barge is going to turn whichever way that Captain says and it's the same with our tongue the Apostle the um the pastor here is saying that that the ships are are controlled even though they go through the fierce winds and yet they are turned about with a very small Helm whatsoever the the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth New King James says how great a forest a l little fire Kindles so we many times in in the summer and in the fall you'll have these forest fires and they start from just one little fire somebody somebody Kindles a little a little campfire or something the wind blows and as that wind blows on that fire it spreads the The Embers around those Embers those Embers go from from grass to grass and and they start they start going down and as the wind blows it starts to to build those little fires all from this little campfire that was going the wind blows on it and it spreads all over and you can have a forest fire that Co that covers tens of thousands of Acres just from one little thing and James is saying this is how your words are one little bit of words and it can do so much damage you can burn down the whole forest and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and Seth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on on fire of Hell another translation says and it is set on fire by hell these words that we say this gossip that we propagate that we repeat James is saying that it's coming from the very pits of hell and it's coming up and and it's going into to you and it's coming out your mouth and it's destroying said how powerful the spoken word is amen and how powerful are the words of mankind we do we have the power to destroy and many have been are being destroyed by the words of mankind especially today and it's never been like today before it it could go a little bit but a little bit out now Boom YouTube video boom it's out and on a small scale gossip in the church and once it gets started once that fire starts burning you can't put it out and it can go with somebody their entire life you can go and you can apologize to them but the toothpaste is out of the tube you can't put it back and once it's out you may want to try to make things right but you can't do it that person's reputation is tarnished because of words they are so harsh for every kind of Beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind I had a friend one time that um he was into falconry and he trained these Hawks and these Hawks would go out and they they'd hunt and they'd come back and and and he was their master and and they were they were with him they trusted him you've seen Dolphins I mean it talks about the the ones in the in the water you've seen Dolphins at SeaWorld or whatever you they go down and they jump and do flips and you know the the person will be standing on their nose and they'll be going around everything can be trained he's saying even a reptile can be trained Can Be Tamed but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison all of us have a tongue and all of us have that poison that James is talking about we all have the ability to do it every one of us therewith bless we God even the father and therewith curse we men so he's saying that that with your tongue you bless God and you praise God God and you and you sing God's glories and and you're here and you're singing with our worship team or or you're singing in your car and you're praising the Lord and that same tongue that you're praising therewith also we curse men which are made after the similitude of God so we speak evil evil maybe based on the truth against someone that is made in the image of God so when we say that are we saying No this person actually is not from God this person's from the devil when we talk about when we when we spread uh gossip about someone true or false are we saying that this person's not made in the image of God we're judging that person saying that they're they're they're from Satan or we saying maybe that we're not made in the image of God James is not saying that we are lying he's saying that we are cursing that person we are destroying his or her character either by starting news that you witness firsthand or by propagating hearsay these things that hurt a person's character brothers and sisters of I said as I said they murder and all of us as I'm talking I'm looking and I see everybody's eyes are very directly on me and I see that all of us have experienced this we've been hurt and I think that all of us have also been on the other side where we have said things that we should not have said out of the same mouth precedes blessing and cursing James says out of the same mouth precedes you're blessing God and and and your you're singing worship and out of that same mouth is coming out cursing he says my brethren these things ought not be so to be does a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and Bitter Sweet Water and bitter so you have you have you have a a spring that's going out and you have a spring that that brings out salt water and it's not usable it's not drinkable this this this spring it can't give out both good water and bad water it doesn't give out good water in the morning and bad water in the evening salt water and and fresh water are infinitely mixable they will they they just are come together so you can't separate the two it's either good or it's bad and he goes on and he says the same thing about a a fig tree or a tree it's like you are what you are this this is a fig tree can a fig tree bring Olive berries no and neither can a grape vine bear figs you are what you are as I said at the beginning our words Define us just as God's words Define him so what are we I think that we should all of us take a time to examine oursel and repent think about think about the things that that we've said and I've I've seen in in the Book of James I think it's perfect we've seen these articles come out uh the newspaper articles I mentioned them a couple times about brother brandom and and then there's people that are being interviewed there that I know and what good would it be for me to come up and for me to attack that person's character with things that I know I would be falling into the same trap right here James says don't do that so if someone is saying something negative about you or about this person or about me or about this church or about someone that you you highly rever don't go and attack that person let the word of God Prevail you can rebuke that person face to face as Michael did with Satan but don't go and attack this person's character even if he has the lowest of all characters whoever the worst person in the world has never been as low as the one that Michael talked to in the book of Jude no one has ever been that low we should never justify ever no matter how bad that they have been never attacking a person's character even if those things that we say are true never and that is the hardest thing to do the same with pastors that have things in their past it's not it's not right for me to go and say you're going to this church or that denomination over there or this over here did you know about this pastor did you know what he has in his past no let the word come forth and you can say I disagree with this person on this on this basis but you don't bring this railing accusation against this person verse number 12 and I go through it quickly now can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive berries or even either of Vine figs so can no Fountain both yield salt and fresh water these things that are being said whether it be you see it on YouTube or whether whether it be in a newspaper or whether it be in a from a Pulpit or whatever if it is attacking someone and attacking their character they are not doing this according to the word of God they have to take James's gospel and they have to throw it out no matter if they are right in what they're saying they're wrong in doing it you can speak the truth and speak the truth wrongly now that doesn't mean don't help people if someone is stuck in a situation or if they're in a hostile Church environment or whatever it is you can help that that person by by no means are you supposed to stand back and just let that person suffer of course you you you help that person you may go to the Bible and say well here's where this is wrong but when you attack the character that is when you get outside of what the word says a defense attorney the first thing a defense attorney will do in defending their client is they will attack the accusers um attack their reputation the first thing they're going to do is they're going to attack that person's character and say now you can't believe this person that's accusing my client because they did this this this and this and this it's a good defense and it works but it's not right according to the Bible it's not right according to the Book of James it's not right according to to Paul's writings and it's it seems a bit uncomfortable you want want when somebody attacks something that you hold so dear you do not you can you can defend yourself but you do not go after that person's character I'll close with this my brother Jeremy um he played on uh the um UFA football team and it was the best team that UFA has ever had they won the Fiesta Bowl that year I think it was like in 1994 around there they won the Fiesta Bowl they were they were just they were one of the nation's best teams and they had this thing called the desert swarm defense you remember they were good there was many times that they would play another another team and the UFA the wild cats would have more yards on their defense than the other team had in their entire offense that for the and it was a good defense and that's how a Christian should be we don't go on the offense we don't attack but we have a very very good defense and this is our defense right here when somebody attacks you the musicians can come if if somebody attacks you then you can go right to this word and just take it you can defend yourself of course and say I didn't say that I didn't do that or I don't believe like that but as James says you don't go after you don't go on the offense verse number 12 says can a fig tree my brethren B Olive berries are either a Vine figs so can no Fountain both yield salt and fresh so if you are a fig tree you're GNA bear figs and if you're bearing olives there's something wrong you're not really a fig tree if you're out using the tongue and you're gossiping and you're spreading the the news about other people and it's in any way destructive even against your enemy you're not bearing figs you have a different nature you with me everybody's looking at me like brothers and sisters thank God thank God that we have the word god God is he is so so good to us and thank God that we can have this correction from from this man James he he wrote this as a pastor saying hey don't be talking about each other don't be running each other down and he goes back to I I wish I knew where he got the information but he said Michael didn't even bring a railing accusation against Satan I would love to know know where that came from it's the word of God so we know it's true but I'd love to hear that story we don't have the story but we have what was important about the story and that is you have no right no matter how evil that person or how much damage that person has done you have no right to attack that person with your tongue amen you with me God bless you brother Josiah [Music] where everything that I hold deep will lay before the holy consuming fire all my works and all my deeds and every prayer set on my knees will lay before the whole consuming fire all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus sh sh in through me let's sing verse one again oh I know the time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the holy consuming fire all my works and all my Deeds every prayer set on my knees will lay before the holy consuming fire all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus [Music] shineing through [Music] me brothers and sisters it's we come to church to receive correction and I got to tell you as I was ministering today I I feel that we did receive and and take what I said to heart take this book to Heart let's be careful what we say always use wisdom in your words because you cannot put your words back in your mouth once they're out there they are out there and they're just spread all over the place so let's be wise in our words use wisdom be quick to hear slow to speak slow to Wrath so I don't forget
