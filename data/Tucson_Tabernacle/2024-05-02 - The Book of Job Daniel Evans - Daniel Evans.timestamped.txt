[22:21] living God bless you brothers and
[22:23] sisters it's good to see everyone out in
[22:25] the house of the Lord tonight let's
[22:27] let's bow our heads for prayer
[22:30] our heavenly
[22:33] father Lord just to think that the same
[22:39] God that we are praying to tonight is
[22:43] the same God that thousands of years ago
[22:45] that job prayed to and that spoke back
[22:48] to
[22:48] job I what have
[22:51] thought you are the almighty never
[22:55] changing ever loving long suffering
[22:59] god father we thank you the opportunity
[23:03] tonight to open up this
[23:05] book we pray father that you'd be with
[23:08] us tonight and Lord the
[23:10] revelations would come forward from this
[23:13] book that we could apply to our own
[23:15] lives and walk closer to you as job
[23:17] walked with you in Jesus name amen amen
[23:22] God bless you all you can take your
[23:26] seats I uh I was sorry hear about uh
[23:31] brother Penrod he um how many people
[23:35] knew brother herb yeah a lot of people
[23:38] longtime member of the Tucson Tabernacle
[23:41] him him and his family I know Stephanie
[23:43] and I when we were kids we used to run
[23:46] around with Nicole and Rebecca and and
[23:49] herb jior and the family so when these
[23:53] people when they leave it's it brings
[23:56] back memories
[23:59] I um I think it's This Book of Job is as
[24:03] we dig into it I think it it really fits
[24:06] perfectly I believe it's really the
[24:07] divine order of God that it's coming
[24:12] after Sunday service which was seeking
[24:15] first the kingdom of God and his
[24:17] righteousness and then all things that
[24:20] you need will be added to you I believe
[24:22] job personified that he the greatest
[24:26] thing in his life the most important
[24:28] thing was that that he would please God
[24:30] and that he would he would walk in the
[24:33] attributes and in the admonition of God
[24:36] and then before that then the week
[24:39] before last week I I spoke on the Prince
[24:42] of
[24:43] Persia and how a demon went to battle
[24:47] with these archangels G Gabriel and
[24:50] Michael and we can see he was delayed
[24:54] this this angel that was coming to
[24:55] Daniel was delayed 21 days because
[24:58] something was going on in a realm that
[25:00] that we just we don't understand and
[25:02] that we can't see and we see this same
[25:04] thing happen a similar Thing Happened
[25:07] Here In This Book of Job where Satan
[25:11] comes to God and does what he does
[25:16] accuses
[25:17] job and um this this book of job in
[25:21] studying this this week it's it's a bit
[25:24] of an an anomaly in the Bible it's it's
[25:27] Unique
[25:28] um it's just different it's different
[25:30] than all the other books I see that no
[25:33] it's mentioned in
[25:35] Ezekiel that Ezekiel puts job right up
[25:38] there with Daniel and with Noah so no
[25:44] this man job he really was this this
[25:47] story really did happen and then we even
[25:49] look in the in the New Testament in the
[25:51] Book of James that he says he says
[25:55] you've heard of the patience of Job so
[25:58] this this
[26:00] book is a very powerful and a very
[26:04] special book it's a story really of the
[26:07] carnal human being it's a story of of
[26:11] real life really that we can all relate
[26:13] to it's a book of questions between God
[26:20] and man between man and man and
[26:24] questions between even God and Satan
[26:28] and
[26:30] it's all of these questions they really
[26:33] add up to one question and that's why do
[26:37] bad things happen to good
[26:40] people we can see here that job was a
[26:43] very very good
[26:44] person the me the even the name job it
[26:47] means
[26:48] persecuted so job was he was a righteous
[26:51] man he was a perfect man and when the
[26:53] Bible says perfect it's not necessarily
[26:55] the same as we would think of perfection
[26:59] it's God looks at perfection in a
[27:03] different way that we look at Perfection
[27:06] we might see that someone has all many
[27:09] different problems and God might look
[27:11] down upon that per person and see that
[27:14] that person is really is perfect before
[27:16] him and then we might see someone as
[27:19] being
[27:20] perfect before God and then God might
[27:24] look down at that person in their deeds
[27:26] and see just filthy rags before him so
[27:30] God's ways as we know God's ways are not
[27:32] our ways his thoughts are not our
[27:34] thoughts he doesn't look the same as we
[27:39] look job
[27:43] was he was a rich man he had seven sons
[27:46] and three daughters he had lots of lots
[27:48] of assets and camels and sheep and
[27:51] donkeys and he really he had it all and
[27:54] he lost it all and it made me
[27:58] think how job was a rich man he knew how
[28:02] it was to be rich and then he found out
[28:05] how it was to be probably the poorest
[28:08] man on Earth Philippians 4 11 and 12
[28:13] another man that was another great man
[28:16] in the Bible this man Paul he says this
[28:19] he says not that I speak in respect of
[28:21] want for I have learned that in
[28:23] whatsoever State I am therewith to be
[28:26] content I know how to both be abased and
[28:29] I know how to abound everywhere and in
[28:32] all things I instructed both to be full
[28:35] and to be hungry both to abound and to
[28:38] suffer
[28:39] need
[28:41] so we see that this I wonder if Paul
[28:45] maybe looked back on this book of Job
[28:48] and read it when he was when he was
[28:50] writing certain things that he wrote it
[28:52] was probably written job as we know is
[28:55] most likely the oldest book in the Bible
[28:57] so does that mean the oldest book of the
[28:59] Bible doesn't mean it goes back before
[29:01] Genesis and records that time it's
[29:03] actually probably the oldest book that
[29:06] was actually written
[29:08] down and we see that how do we know how
[29:12] old this book is well number one we see
[29:15] that job's wealth is measured in the
[29:20] number of animals he possessed rather
[29:22] than how much money he had or how much
[29:24] gold he had there's no reference in job
[29:28] to any other book of the Bible and
[29:30] there's no reference to any other
[29:31] prophet and neither is there reference
[29:33] to any of the
[29:35] Israelites unlike pretty much every
[29:37] other book in the Bible he doesn't
[29:39] reference the sons and the daughters of
[29:42] Abraham and another way the we know it's
[29:44] very old is right at the last of the
[29:47] chap Last of The Book of Job we see that
[29:49] job lived to be 140 years
[29:52] old that's
[29:54] old so what Pro when it was probably
[29:58] written as Abraham lived to be 175 years
[30:01] old so we can guess that job was the
[30:06] Book of Job was probably written right
[30:10] around the time of Abraham maybe a
[30:13] little bit before maybe a little bit
[30:15] after we know that it was written After
[30:17] the flood because Before the Flood they
[30:20] lived really old hundreds of years after
[30:24] the flood we see that their age starts
[30:27] dwindling down Abraham I think was 175 I
[30:31] think Isaac was like 180 and then Jacob
[30:34] I think was like 140 or 110 or 120
[30:38] something like that and it just gets
[30:40] less and less before ultimately it comes
[30:42] to about 75 years old sometime after
[30:45] Moses so we can pretty much put this
[30:49] book of Job between the anti- deluvian
[30:54] destruction which is the flood and
[30:58] Moses because he doesn't quote anything
[31:01] else Moses wrote Genesis so Moses wrote
[31:06] from the beginning all the way down but
[31:10] job most likely lived well before Moses
[31:13] lived so job didn't have the bible to
[31:17] read the characters in the book of job
[31:19] are job and his wife plays a a brief
[31:23] part in there as I mentioned before
[31:25] Satan is there job's friends he has
[31:30] three of these friends bildad elifaz and
[31:34] zofar and then another young man comes
[31:37] in at the end named
[31:39] elu and then God himself speaks in this
[31:45] book so job lived it says in the land of
[31:48] us which is today Southern Jordan it's a
[31:53] desert desolate area today so let's dig
[31:58] into the book Let's Open up The Book of
[32:01] Job and turn to chapter
[32:06] 1 verse
[32:08] one there was a man in the land of us
[32:12] whose name was job and that man was
[32:15] perfect and upright and one that feared
[32:18] God and asted Evil that word ASU is Old
[32:21] English it's not used today it means
[32:23] that he turned away from evil or he
[32:25] shunned evil and that word perfect as I
[32:29] said before in other translations it it
[32:32] it means blameless or it means without
[32:34] reproach so as we read the book of job
[32:37] then you you'll see that he is in no way
[32:40] a perfect man by our definition of the
[32:43] word but our thinking as I said is far
[32:46] away from God's
[32:49] thinking so we might see some faults in
[32:54] job but when God looks down on them
[32:57] you'll see see that God saw a perfect
[33:00] man before
[33:01] him verse number two and there were born
[33:04] unto him seven sons and three daughters
[33:06] as I mentioned he has 10 children his
[33:09] substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000
[33:12] camels and 500 Yol of oxen and 500 she
[33:15] asses and very great household so that
[33:19] this man was the greatest of all the men
[33:21] in the
[33:23] East and his sons went and feasted in
[33:26] their houses everyone his day and sent
[33:29] and called for their three sisters to
[33:31] eat and to drink with them and it was so
[33:35] then when the days of their feasting
[33:37] were gone about that job sent and Sac
[33:41] Sanctified them and Rose up early in the
[33:43] morning and offered burnt offerings
[33:45] according to the number of them all for
[33:48] job said it may be that my sons have
[33:50] sented and cursed God in their hearts
[33:53] thus did job
[33:56] continually I could easily spend the
[33:59] rest of the lesson just on that verse
[34:02] Not only was job concerned about his
[34:04] kids but he was willing to do something
[34:07] about it he probably saw weaknesses in
[34:10] his children and imagine how difficult
[34:13] just physically difficult it would be to
[34:16] offer burnt offerings not just one time
[34:19] for all of your children but he offered
[34:22] them individually for each child and not
[34:25] just once he did it continually
[34:29] this was a lot this was a great
[34:32] sacrifice that job made by making these
[34:35] burnt offering
[34:37] sacrifices now right at the beginning of
[34:39] the story here we're going to see that
[34:42] it goes into the spiritual realm and it
[34:45] goes up into
[34:47] heaven The Story Goes where God
[34:50] is it says
[34:52] this now there was a day when the sons
[34:55] of God came to present themselves before
[34:57] the Lord
[34:58] and Satan came also among them so who is
[35:02] this Satan we we we think we know you
[35:05] know it's it's a devil but the word
[35:07] Satan it's a Hebrew word it means the
[35:09] accuser it means the adversary it's
[35:11] almost more proper to call him the Satan
[35:15] rather rather than just Satan because he
[35:18] is the accuser he is the one that is
[35:20] always against God's people and the Lord
[35:24] said unto Satan whence comest thou then
[35:26] Satan answered Ed the Lord and said from
[35:29] going to and fro in the earth and from
[35:31] walking up and down in it now notice
[35:35] here that Satan is not everywhere he's
[35:39] not what we would call
[35:40] omnipresent he moves around he moves
[35:43] here and there and his angels or his
[35:45] underlings they they go out and and they
[35:48] serve him and they do his bidding but
[35:50] this spirit this Satan is
[35:54] singular this is one being that is
[35:59] having this discussion here with God and
[36:02] the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[36:05] considered my servant job that there is
[36:07] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[36:09] upright man one that fearth God and asth
[36:14] Evil then Satan answered the Lord and
[36:17] said does job fear God for
[36:21] not does job fear God for no
[36:26] reason has not Thou made a hedge around
[36:30] him and about his house and about all
[36:33] that he hath on every side thou Hast
[36:35] blessed the work of his hands and his
[36:38] substance is increased in the
[36:41] land but put forth thine hand now and
[36:44] touch all that he hath and he will curse
[36:47] thee to thy face now notice the nature
[36:50] of Satan again he's an
[36:52] accuser he's in the presence of God so
[36:55] he's not in hell you know we think of
[36:57] Satan being in hell with his Pitchfork
[37:00] and the Flames going everywhere and his
[37:02] demons going around that's not how it is
[37:05] Satan probably has it pretty good right
[37:07] now and he's got a job and his job is to
[37:12] accuse the Brethren before the Lord and
[37:16] the and the sister when I say Brethren I
[37:17] mean I mean the
[37:20] people and the Lord said unto Satan
[37:23] behold all that he hath is in thy power
[37:26] only upon himself
[37:28] put not forth thine hand so Satan went
[37:30] forth from the presence of
[37:32] God so again things aren't like we think
[37:36] they are in our minds notice how God
[37:39] knows what's going on and Satan knows
[37:42] what's going on in this situation so we
[37:44] have God and Satan have this discussion
[37:46] they know they know what's going to
[37:48] happen but poor job has no idea what's
[37:52] going on he's probably just having a cup
[37:53] of coffee with his
[37:55] wife going through his day maybe taking
[37:58] inventory of his sheep and and wondering
[38:00] how we should take care of uh the South
[38:03] pasture or
[38:05] whatever so right after this meeting in
[38:09] heaven when Satan leaves the presence of
[38:12] God then tragedy strikes and his
[38:16] livestock they're either stolen or fire
[38:19] actually comes down from
[38:21] heaven and kills them kills his servants
[38:24] with them and then
[38:28] Invaders come and then they kill they
[38:30] take a bunch of other livestock and they
[38:32] kill more of his servants and the worst
[38:35] thing of
[38:37] all past losing all of his wealth Jose
[38:42] um job's oldest son has all of his
[38:46] brothers and his sisters over to his
[38:49] house and a great wind comes it might be
[38:52] a tornado or some sort of powerful wind
[38:55] and it it breaks the house down the
[38:57] house collapses and kills all of his
[39:02] children so I don't know how things
[39:04] could be
[39:05] worse than that those of us that are
[39:08] parents imagine not one child one child
[39:11] is devastating but all of your
[39:14] children let's skip to verse
[39:17] 20 then job
[39:20] arose and rent his mantle he ripped his
[39:25] garment and he shaved his head
[39:28] and he fell down upon the ground and he
[39:30] worshiped now Jo job handles this
[39:34] situation really believe this man job
[39:37] seems like a Christian long before Jesus
[39:40] came yeah all the way back in our study
[39:43] on the Bible in Genesis we see that the
[39:45] holy spirit is manifesting itself in the
[39:48] first chapter of Genesis when the spirit
[39:51] of God moved across the face of the deep
[39:54] so we see the holy spirit all the way
[39:56] back in Genesis so now we see this Holy
[39:59] Spirit shining forth from a man
[40:02] thousands of years ago who had just lost
[40:05] everything and watch the character of
[40:07] this man job and that's what I will keep
[40:09] saying he he he shaved his head which
[40:11] was a sign of mourning and he fell down
[40:13] to the ground now this could all be
[40:15] expected most people would would do
[40:18] something like that mourning that their
[40:20] loved ones were
[40:21] gone and remember and I'll say this a
[40:25] few times tonight Jo
[40:27] did not have a
[40:31] Bible job didn't have a pastor that was
[40:35] teaching him the word of
[40:38] God job was missing this he couldn't
[40:41] read and and and get encouragement from
[40:45] a promise of God he didn't have it right
[40:48] he didn't have a promise of a comforter
[40:49] he didn't have a promise of a messiah
[40:52] the one thing that job had is the thing
[40:55] that so many of us desire brother and
[40:57] sisters I desire it more than anything
[40:59] the one thing that job had was a
[41:03] relationship with
[41:05] God and that brought him through as we
[41:07] see when we go through this
[41:10] book he fell on the ground he worshiped
[41:15] God he worshiped
[41:18] God he was
[41:20] mourning
[41:22] struggling his whole life had just been
[41:25] destroyed and what did does he do look
[41:27] at his character he falls down and he
[41:31] worships what a what a wonderful thing I
[41:34] mean how many of us would be doing that
[41:37] we'd be I'd be we may be a nervous
[41:39] wrecker
[41:41] or wanting to go to the hospital or
[41:44] whatever it is but job gets down on his
[41:47] knees falls down and just worships his
[41:52] Lord his character is almost without
[41:56] equal and you see how God calls him
[41:58] perfect he was perfect because even in
[42:00] the worst of times where the worst
[42:02] imaginable things happen the worse than
[42:05] any sinner on Earth at that time
[42:07] happened to that person yet at this time
[42:10] he worshiped God I mentioned the Apostle
[42:14] Paul before let me mention him
[42:17] again 2 Corinthians chapter
[42:20] 12 verse 7 he says
[42:23] this and lest I should be exalted above
[42:26] measures through the abundance of
[42:27] Revelation there was given to me a thorn
[42:30] in the
[42:31] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[42:34] me lest I should be exalted above me
[42:38] this is very similar to what we're going
[42:40] to learn right now lest I be exalted
[42:43] above meas measure job was a good man
[42:46] and he was a humble man but he thought
[42:49] that he was always doing
[42:52] right for this thing I besought the Lord
[42:56] Thrice that it might depart from me and
[42:58] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[43:00] for thee my strength is made perfect in
[43:04] weakness most gladly therefore will I
[43:07] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[43:10] power of Christ May rest upon me
[43:13] therefore I take my pleasure in
[43:16] infirmities in reproaches in necessities
[43:18] and persecution in distress for Christ's
[43:21] sake for when I am
[43:23] weak then I am strong
[43:28] as I said before I wonder if Paul maybe
[43:32] was reading the book of Job when he was
[43:34] struggling with that thorn in his flesh
[43:37] how how many people have have been
[43:39] comforted Through The Years with this
[43:42] book when they've had problems and I
[43:45] believe maybe that that Paul probably
[43:47] was comforted
[43:49] also so you see job and his character it
[43:52] rises to the top during the weakest
[43:56] moments of his life we've
[43:59] heard
[44:01] prophecy about a squeeze we've heard it
[44:04] talked about a lot about a squeeze maybe
[44:08] that's going to come on God's children
[44:11] and you think a you think about a
[44:13] squeeze and when you when you
[44:16] squeeze an orange orange juice comes out
[44:21] when you take a lemon and you squeeze a
[44:24] lemon then lemon juice comes out
[44:27] so when the squeeze is put on job watch
[44:32] what comes out of him it's nothing but
[44:35] the holy spirit that comes out on job
[44:37] and what about us when the trials get
[44:40] hard and the pressure comes down and and
[44:42] maybe there's there's arguing or or
[44:45] something between us when we're squeezed
[44:48] what comes out of us is it the Holy
[44:50] Spirit like it is with this man
[44:56] job job 1:20 it says this again and then
[44:58] job arose and rent his mantel and shaved
[45:01] his head and fell down upon the ground
[45:03] and he
[45:04] worshiped and said naked came I out of
[45:06] my mother's womb and naked shall I
[45:08] return
[45:09] tother the lord gave and the Lord hath
[45:12] taken away blessed be the name of the
[45:15] Lord
[45:17] wow in all this job s not nor charged
[45:22] God
[45:25] foolishly so then if we go to verse
[45:27] chapter 2 so what I'm going to do is
[45:29] we'll read chapter one which we just did
[45:32] we'll read chapter two and then we will
[45:36] go through the the book of jobs in a few
[45:39] different portions the first part of it
[45:41] is this going on with with Satan coming
[45:44] down and afflicting job and killing his
[45:47] family and killing his livestock and and
[45:49] doing what Satan does and then job you
[45:52] see his reaction and he worships the
[45:54] Lord and then after this then we will
[45:57] come to job has three friends that come
[46:01] visit him to comfort him and then that
[46:04] is most of the book there and we will go
[46:07] through that quickly and then the the
[46:10] story ends with a a bit of a Twist I
[46:15] think most of us know the end of the
[46:17] book but there's some things in there
[46:19] that you probably never notice that I
[46:21] like to point out when we get to the end
[46:24] so chapter 2 again there was a day when
[46:28] the sons of God came to present
[46:29] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[46:31] came also among them to present himself
[46:34] before the Lord and the Lord said unto
[46:36] Satan from whence comest thou and Satan
[46:38] answered the Lord and said from going to
[46:40] and fro in the Earth from walking up and
[46:43] down in it again this spirit is saying
[46:48] I've been going around making my rounds
[46:52] looking at the people studying the
[46:55] people watching them maybe finding their
[46:59] weaknesses going back and forth he's an
[47:04] evil just a sneaky guy this Satan
[47:08] is and the Lord said unto Satan hast
[47:12] thou considered my servant
[47:14] job that there is none like him in the
[47:17] earth a perfect and upright man one that
[47:19] fearth God and a steth evil one that
[47:21] turns Away From Evil and still he
[47:24] holdeth F fast his integrity although
[47:27] thou movest me against him to destroy
[47:29] him without a cause he says okay Satan
[47:33] you just took everything from him and
[47:37] what did he do he fell down and
[47:39] worshiped me that's my boy I'm proud of
[47:44] him and Satan answered the Lord and said
[47:46] skin for
[47:48] skin yeah all that a man hath will he
[47:51] give for his life but put forth thine
[47:54] hand now and touch his bone and his
[47:56] flesh and he will curse thee to thy face
[48:00] look at Satan this evil
[48:02] spirit brothers and sisters people
[48:04] always think that you will act like they
[48:10] will act or that you will react like
[48:14] they will react you see the most
[48:16] paranoid
[48:17] people about other people talking about
[48:20] them are usually the biggest gossipers
[48:22] and the biggest accus
[48:24] accusers the ones who have the most are
[48:27] the most concerned with money are
[48:29] usually the ones who have the biggest
[48:31] financial problems at home wow the ones
[48:34] who are the ones who are most worried
[48:36] about someone taking something from
[48:39] them are the ones who are quick to take
[48:42] something from someone else the ones who
[48:45] are always worried about getting ripped
[48:47] off are usually the ones who are willing
[48:52] to rip someone off I'm I'm making
[48:54] General statements here I know and
[48:58] usually not always but usually the most
[49:00] trusting people are the ones that can be
[49:03] trusted the most and you see the
[49:05] character of Satan here and he
[49:08] cares this man Satan he cares about one
[49:12] person and that is himself and that is a
[49:17] characteristic of Satan he thinks about
[49:20] this guy and every decision he makes
[49:23] every every time he does anything it it
[49:26] is to promote himself or to further his
[49:32] cause we never see Satan paying
[49:35] compliments to someone else unless he's
[49:38] doing it to get what he
[49:40] wants and
[49:44] here he really thinks that job is gonna
[49:48] act like he would
[49:50] act if you take my health I'll curse you
[49:53] to your face if you take something from
[49:55] me if you make me miserable it's all
[49:58] about me so I'm going to fight you God
[50:02] I'm going to forsake this whole thing
[50:04] this Christianity how many times do I
[50:06] seen someone start to go to
[50:09] church give their life to the Lord and
[50:12] watch how hard it is on them they'll get
[50:16] in a car wreck or they'll they'll have
[50:18] financial problems or something big will
[50:21] happen and that is that testing
[50:25] time and here we see Satan he's like
[50:28] okay here's what I would do if this
[50:30] happened to me I'd be out let me do that
[50:33] to him and God says okay do it don't
[50:35] take his
[50:36] life and the Lord said to Satan behold
[50:39] he is in thine hand but save his
[50:42] life one thing here this happened twice
[50:44] now do you notice that Satan can only do
[50:48] his work by permission from
[50:51] God remember Jesus casted out the evil
[50:54] spirit from the insane man and they
[50:56] asked permission can we go into these
[50:59] these
[51:00] pigs and then Jesus said go and do it
[51:05] remember when the lying Spirit came
[51:08] before God to ask permission to go into
[51:11] ahab's prophets to deceive him so that
[51:13] he would go to battle and die in battle
[51:16] remember that they asked permission it
[51:19] is only by God's permission so when
[51:21] these bad things happen to us just
[51:24] remember God knows about it and God
[51:26] allowed it to
[51:29] happen this is exactly what happens to
[51:31] job so so went Satan forth from the
[51:33] presence of the Lord and smokee job with
[51:36] sore boils from The Souls sole of his
[51:39] foot unto his crown and he took him a a
[51:42] potur of to scrape
[51:45] himself with all and he sat down among
[51:48] the ashes now this potur is um it's a
[51:51] it's a piece of broken pottery with a
[51:53] sharp edge and I assume it was some sort
[51:55] of a treatment that he was doing for
[51:58] sick people he was scraping off probably
[52:00] the dying
[52:02] flesh later
[52:04] on in the book that we won't read it but
[52:07] job describes his sores as even having
[52:10] worms in them probably had maggots in
[52:13] there and later he describes pain in his
[52:16] bones so he was sick all the way to the
[52:19] Bone it wasn't just scraping boils this
[52:23] man job was deathly deathly ill and he
[52:26] was
[52:28] suffering he had lost his wealth he had
[52:31] lost his children and now he' lost his
[52:34] health thank goodness he had a loving
[52:37] wife at home to take care of
[52:41] him and then said his wife unto him Dost
[52:46] thou still retain thine in Integrity
[52:48] Curse God and die I guess
[52:52] not but he said unto her thou speakest
[52:55] as one of the foolish women speaketh
[52:57] what shall we receive good at the hand
[52:59] of God and shall we not receive evil and
[53:02] all of this did not job sin even with
[53:06] his
[53:07] lips what a profound statement that we
[53:10] are here on Earth to just
[53:13] receive what we're not here on Earth to
[53:16] just receive
[53:18] good and not the bad we always think
[53:21] God's always loving he's always taking
[53:23] care of us he's always given us all
[53:25] these good things and he has All Good
[53:26] Things Come From God but don't forget
[53:29] that God sends us the hard times too
[53:31] because it's good for
[53:33] us but look at this man's Integrity no
[53:36] matter what
[53:37] happened he glorified God now when job's
[53:41] three friends heard of all this evil
[53:44] that was come upon him they came
[53:46] everyone from his own place elifaz the
[53:49] tanite and bildad the shuhite and zofar
[53:53] the
[53:54] nthite for they had made an appointment
[53:56] o together to come to mourn with him and
[53:59] to comfort him and when they lifted up
[54:01] their eyes AAR off and knew him not they
[54:04] lifted up their voices and wept and they
[54:06] rent everyone his mantle and sprinkled
[54:09] dust upon their head toward heaven and
[54:12] they sat down with him upon the ground
[54:14] seven days and seven nights and none
[54:16] spake a word unto him for they saw that
[54:20] his grief was very
[54:24] great now what they did here was very
[54:27] good very kind and it's probably
[54:30] comforting for job here are his friends
[54:33] and they're staying with him for a week
[54:35] and they're mourning his losses and if
[54:37] they didn't talk with him that probably
[54:39] meant that job didn't talk with
[54:42] them they were just there for
[54:46] him and brothers and sisters when we're
[54:48] comforting
[54:50] someone who is grieving either for a
[54:53] lost loved one or may maybe they're
[54:55] having a hard time in life most of the
[54:58] time the best comfort that you can give
[55:00] someone is to just
[55:02] listen just let them
[55:05] talk because sometimes you just got to
[55:07] get it off your chest and you just need
[55:09] somebody that loves you enough just to
[55:13] hear and not to start telling you
[55:15] stories about how they overcame this or
[55:18] or I know exactly how you feel and I've
[55:20] done this and and and I was in this
[55:22] situation then all of a sudden it
[55:24] becomes about the comforter which is
[55:25] what you're going to see here in the
[55:27] Book of Job and not about the person
[55:29] that actually needs Comfort it helps
[55:33] when someone just
[55:35] listens and I think that it was very
[55:38] nice
[55:40] when they were there at first and they
[55:44] were just listening seven days they
[55:47] stayed with
[55:48] him
[55:52] but one of the biggest lessons in the
[55:54] book is that these three guys they never
[55:55] really put themselves in job's shoes
[55:58] they they looked at the situation they
[56:00] looked at what has happened and they
[56:02] jumped to the conclusion that this job
[56:04] must have sinned and sinned and brought
[56:06] all of this upon himself and what they
[56:09] didn't know in all of their condemnation
[56:13] that they were actually the ones
[56:15] speaking on behalf of Satan himself
[56:19] because they were the ones accusing so
[56:23] there's that Spirit up with God again
[56:25] saying let me do this let me go down
[56:27] I'll take I'll take his family I'll take
[56:30] his health I'll take his wealth I'll
[56:32] take everything and now that condemning
[56:34] Spirit look at how it gets in these
[56:38] three
[56:41] friends so job's three three three
[56:44] friends now they begin this dialogue
[56:46] back and forth where they each accuse
[56:49] accuse job of sinning because all of
[56:51] these bad things that happened to him
[56:53] elifaz is the first one here he says
[56:55] this in chapter 4 and I'll read his
[56:59] accusation and they pretty much all say
[57:01] the same thing just in different ways
[57:04] and then job will defend himself and he
[57:07] defends himself many times in the same
[57:09] way so let's let's turn to chapter 4
[57:11] verse one then elifaz the temanite
[57:15] answered and said if we assay to commune
[57:18] with thee wilt thou be grieved but who
[57:20] can withhold himself from speaking so
[57:23] he's warning job he's saying Hey listen
[57:25] you're not going to like what I'm about
[57:27] to
[57:28] say and he's saying that but I just
[57:32] can't hold back in speaking to you yeah
[57:36] because you're just such a sinner job
[57:38] you're doing so much wrong this it just
[57:40] Grieves me so much I can't hold back I
[57:44] got to tell
[57:45] you and it's because it's about this
[57:49] elaz and it's not about comforting job
[57:53] let's skip to verse seven
[57:56] remember I pray thee whoever perished
[57:59] being
[58:01] innocent whoever suffered for being
[58:04] innocent job you're
[58:07] suffering or where were the righteous
[58:09] cut off even as I have seen that they
[58:12] plow iniquity and sow Wicked wickedness
[58:16] and reap the
[58:18] same so those that spread W wickedness
[58:22] they reap the same wickedness look at
[58:24] what he's insinuating he's saying you've
[58:26] sinned job and that's why all this
[58:28] wickedness Came Upon
[58:30] you by the blast of God they perish and
[58:33] by the breath of his nostrils are they
[58:34] consumed notice they're invoking God
[58:37] here this is a religious
[58:41] discussion The Roaring of The Lion and
[58:43] the voice of the fierce Lion and the
[58:45] teeth of the Young Lions are
[58:47] broken he's saying no matter how great
[58:49] you are job God's Gonna Cut You Down man
[58:53] God's Gonna rip you apart
[58:57] The Old Lion perished for the lack of
[58:59] prey and the Stout Lion's welps are
[59:01] scouted abroad now a thing was secretly
[59:04] brought to me and my ear received a
[59:07] little thereof in thoughts from the
[59:10] visions of the night when deep sleep
[59:14] falleth on men fear Came Upon me and
[59:18] trembling which made all my bones to
[59:21] shake he's saying job I had this
[59:22] experience with God and it was about you
[59:29] then a spirit passed before my face the
[59:33] hair of my flesh stood up it stood still
[59:36] but I could not discern the form thereof
[59:38] an image was before mine eyes there was
[59:41] silence and I heard a voice saying shall
[59:43] Mortal Mortal men be more just than God
[59:48] shall a man be more pure than his maker
[59:51] behold he put no trust in his servants
[59:53] and his angels he charged with with
[59:56] Folly how much less in them that dwell
[59:58] in the house houses of clay whose
[1:00:01] Foundation is in the dust which are
[1:00:03] crushed before the moth they are
[1:00:06] destroyed from the morning to the
[1:00:08] evening they perish forever without any
[1:00:11] regarding it doth not their Excellency
[1:00:14] which is in them go away they die even
[1:00:17] without wisdom so this man is say he's
[1:00:19] saying job God told me that you're a
[1:00:23] sinner I don't care how righteous you
[1:00:25] look on the outside and how much you've
[1:00:27] helped others you are a sinner because I
[1:00:30] had this
[1:00:33] experience I don't doubt that elifaz had
[1:00:37] an experience in the
[1:00:39] night and I don't doubt that he was sure
[1:00:42] that it was from
[1:00:44] God but my question is was his
[1:00:48] experience that seem so much like God
[1:00:52] was it from God or was it from the
[1:00:56] deceiver the
[1:00:59] accuser always all of us we have to be
[1:01:02] so careful we can have an
[1:01:05] experience this man had an experience
[1:01:09] but this was not from
[1:01:12] god so let's uh let's continue on let's
[1:01:15] skip to um let's skip to job let's skip
[1:01:18] to verse chapter six so job is he's
[1:01:22] being accused by these men and now job
[1:01:26] he wants to give he he starts to give
[1:01:29] his answer to all these accusations and
[1:01:32] look at how humble job is and look at
[1:01:34] look at how that he responds he says Job
[1:01:37] chapter 6:8 he says oh that I might have
[1:01:41] my request and that God would grant me
[1:01:44] the thing that I long for even that it
[1:01:47] would please God to destroy me that he
[1:01:50] would let loose his hand and cut me off
[1:01:56] so then later
[1:01:57] on this goes back and forth between
[1:02:01] these men and job and in chapter 14 job
[1:02:04] responds to Z
[1:02:08] zofar Jo zofar is saying the same thing
[1:02:10] he's accusing job of of sinning secretly
[1:02:14] now remember job doesn't have a bible to
[1:02:16] read job doesn't have stories that we
[1:02:21] know of that that God had done these
[1:02:23] Great and Mighty things like part in the
[1:02:26] Red Sea or or
[1:02:28] that doing the great things that he did
[1:02:31] with Abraham and and all of these things
[1:02:34] before but all he had this job he had
[1:02:39] dead
[1:02:40] children he had complete poverty he had
[1:02:43] a wife that hates him and his God had
[1:02:46] forsaken
[1:02:47] him and here's
[1:02:50] job this was a very very bad situation
[1:02:56] job is absolutely
[1:02:58] dying his friends are here and they're
[1:03:01] accusing him and job must have been
[1:03:02] thinking what did I do wrong what have I
[1:03:05] done I look at all these other people
[1:03:06] they're all they're all sinning and I'm
[1:03:08] just doing my best I was trying to make
[1:03:10] an offering for my children and then
[1:03:11] look what happened all 10 of them
[1:03:14] died and this had to come from God Fire
[1:03:17] doesn't come out from heaven and kill
[1:03:19] your
[1:03:21] livestock this had to come from God so
[1:03:24] here's job and he's contemplating these
[1:03:28] things and he doesn't have a Bible to he
[1:03:31] doesn't have the Book of Job to
[1:03:33] read and he looks out and he
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:38] sees a stump of a tree that had been cut
[1:03:43] off a dead tree and he looks and he sees
[1:03:48] where the saw had cut it off and he sees
[1:03:51] this dead tree and he sees out of this
[1:03:54] tree
[1:03:56] is growing life shoots green is coming
[1:04:02] out of this tree and he looks at
[1:04:04] it and he sees God in all this and he he
[1:04:10] looks at himself and he says look at me
[1:04:12] I'm dying my children are dying and he
[1:04:14] says oh if that tree can
[1:04:18] live then can't a man live maybe my
[1:04:22] children could they live again
[1:04:27] let's turn to Chapter 14 verse
[1:04:30] one and as he looks out he says this man
[1:04:34] that is born of a woman is a few days
[1:04:38] and full of
[1:04:39] trouble he cometh forth like a flower
[1:04:41] and is cut down he fleeth also as a
[1:04:44] shadow and continueth not and doth thou
[1:04:48] open Thine Eyes Upon such a one and
[1:04:50] bringest me into judgment with thee who
[1:04:53] can bring a clean thing out of an uncan
[1:04:56] not
[1:04:57] one seeing his days are determined the
[1:05:00] number of his months are with thee thou
[1:05:03] Hast appointed his bonds that he cannot
[1:05:06] pass turn from him that he may rest till
[1:05:09] he shall accomplish as a hirling his day
[1:05:13] for there is a hope of a
[1:05:15] tree if it be cut down that it will
[1:05:19] Sprout again and that the tender Branch
[1:05:22] thereof will not cease it will continue
[1:05:25] to
[1:05:26] live though the root thereof waxes old
[1:05:29] in the earth and the stock thereof die
[1:05:31] in the ground yet through the scent of
[1:05:34] water it will bud and bring forth boughs
[1:05:37] like a
[1:05:39] plant but a man
[1:05:42] dies and he Wast
[1:05:44] away yeah a man give giveth up The Ghost
[1:05:47] and where is he as the waters fail from
[1:05:51] the sea and as the flood decayeth and
[1:05:53] dry up so man lith down and riseth not
[1:05:55] till the heavens be no more they shall
[1:05:58] not awake nor be raised out of their
[1:06:00] sleep he's like this
[1:06:03] tree was
[1:06:05] dead and now it's living He says oh that
[1:06:08] thou would hide me in the grave that
[1:06:11] thou wouldest keep me secret until thy
[1:06:14] wrath be passed that thou wouldest
[1:06:17] appoint me a set time and remember
[1:06:22] me there's job and he's reading this
[1:06:25] Bible in
[1:06:26] nature and he's seeing the
[1:06:29] resurrection of the plants and of the
[1:06:32] flowers and of this tree and he says if
[1:06:35] a man die shall he live
[1:06:39] again all the days of my appointed time
[1:06:42] will I wait till my change
[1:06:45] Come Thou shalt
[1:06:47] call and I will answer thee thou wil
[1:06:51] have a
[1:06:53] desire to the work of thy hands job saw
[1:06:57] the
[1:06:59] resurrection he didn't have a bible to
[1:07:00] read he didn't have a promise of a
[1:07:02] Rapture he didn't know what the Rapture
[1:07:03] was he probably never heard of a of a
[1:07:05] Rapture or or of a resurrection or any
[1:07:08] of this but job looked and he saw nature
[1:07:10] he said how beautiful maybe there's hope
[1:07:14] there that I will see my family
[1:07:16] again my
[1:07:20] children look at the Revelation in this
[1:07:23] man of God then in chapter
[1:07:26] 19 again they're attacking him and
[1:07:28] they're they're accusing him all this
[1:07:31] and job responds again and he says all
[1:07:33] my inward friends verse 19 chapter 19
[1:07:36] verse 19 all my inward friends they
[1:07:40] me they detest
[1:07:42] me and they whom I love are turned
[1:07:45] against me my bone cleaveth to my skin
[1:07:48] and to My Flesh and I am escaped with
[1:07:50] the skin of my teeth have pity upon me
[1:07:54] and have pity upon me
[1:07:57] oh ye friends oh ye my friends for the
[1:07:59] hand of God ha touched me he's saying
[1:08:06] just have pity on me I'm
[1:08:11] struggling hand of God has touched me
[1:08:14] and been hard on me why do you persecute
[1:08:17] me as God are are and are not satisfied
[1:08:21] with my flesh are you not satisfied that
[1:08:23] I'm dying here
[1:08:27] why would you persecute me as God and
[1:08:29] are not satisfied with my flesh oh that
[1:08:31] my words were now
[1:08:34] written oh that they were printed in a
[1:08:38] book that's pretty
[1:08:42] cool that his words job said this before
[1:08:47] there was a Bible printed before there
[1:08:50] was a Torah before there was writings of
[1:08:53] Moses before there was anything he said
[1:08:55] oh that my words were printed in a book
[1:08:59] that they were Graven with an iron pin
[1:09:01] and a lead rock forever they're better
[1:09:04] than that
[1:09:05] job that would be long gone by now but
[1:09:08] we are reading your words tonight in the
[1:09:11] Tucson
[1:09:13] Tabernacle for I know that my redeemer
[1:09:16] Li liveth and that he shall stand at the
[1:09:18] latter day upon the Earth and though
[1:09:21] after my skin worms destroy this body
[1:09:23] yet in my flesh I see I see God again
[1:09:27] nothing but Revelation here from job
[1:09:30] there was something in him that knew
[1:09:32] that there was a life beyond this life
[1:09:36] so then chapters 27 through 31 it's a
[1:09:39] monologue by job and he's talking about
[1:09:41] his past life experiences and his and
[1:09:44] his present situation where everything
[1:09:46] had just Fallen apart and then in
[1:09:48] chapters 32 through
[1:09:49] 37 are spoken of by this young man named
[1:09:53] elu this
[1:09:56] is different than the other three this
[1:09:59] young man elu was full of wisdom he
[1:10:02] rebukes first thing he says first thing
[1:10:04] he does is he rebukes these other three
[1:10:06] guys and then he speaks to job and he
[1:10:09] speaks in a different Spirit but it is
[1:10:13] correction we don't have time to read
[1:10:16] through it but he basically tells job he
[1:10:18] says trust God in these things then
[1:10:21] chapter
[1:10:24] 38 the Lord answered job out of a
[1:10:27] whirlwind
[1:10:29] now God is going to speak we've had all
[1:10:33] brother Jonathan we had all this back
[1:10:34] and forth we've had all this this
[1:10:36] fighting and job is just dying and he's
[1:10:38] he's trying to trying to just redeem
[1:10:41] something of his life and we see these
[1:10:44] three men and they're attacking
[1:10:46] him and
[1:10:48] now God steps on the
[1:10:52] scene then the Lord answered job out of
[1:10:54] the worldwind
[1:10:56] and
[1:10:57] said who is it that dark darkeneth
[1:11:02] counsel by words without knowledge G up
[1:11:06] now thy loins like a man for I will
[1:11:08] demand of thee and answer thou
[1:11:11] me he's said get up
[1:11:14] job you've suffered enough now stand up
[1:11:17] like a man and you are going to get an
[1:11:19] answer from the almighty God right
[1:11:22] now where were you
[1:11:25] when I laid the foundations of the
[1:11:28] earth
[1:11:30] declare if thou Hast
[1:11:33] understanding the Lord is saying right
[1:11:36] here this is me
[1:11:41] speaking who hath laid the measures
[1:11:43] thereof if thou knowest or who hath
[1:11:46] stretched the line upon it whereupon are
[1:11:49] the foundations thereof fastened or who
[1:11:51] laid the Cornerstone thereof when the
[1:11:53] morning Stars sang together and all the
[1:11:55] sons of God shouted for Joy the Lord
[1:11:58] goes on to speak he's basically saying
[1:12:01] job I know you've defended yourself but
[1:12:03] you're not all that
[1:12:05] either yes you've made your defense but
[1:12:07] don't forget who I am with all the
[1:12:10] arguing and all the back and forth even
[1:12:12] the greatest of men are nothing when it
[1:12:16] comes to
[1:12:18] God he says where were you when I laid
[1:12:22] the foundations of the Earth let me hear
[1:12:24] your understand understanding of a job
[1:12:26] do you think it compares to mine so the
[1:12:29] Lord goes on and job humbly answers in
[1:12:32] chapter 40 verse three job says this
[1:12:35] then job answered the Lord and said
[1:12:37] behold I am vile what shall I answer
[1:12:40] Thee I will lay my hand upon my mouth
[1:12:43] once have I spoken but I will not answer
[1:12:47] yay twice but I will proceed no
[1:12:49] further then the Lord goes on speaking
[1:12:52] to job and telling him hey you don't
[1:12:54] know about any of this stuff I'm God I
[1:12:57] created all this and let me see if you
[1:13:00] can do anything that I've done job so
[1:13:03] he's in chapter 41 I like I like what he
[1:13:06] said this he talked he was telling job
[1:13:09] about this Le the Leviathan which is
[1:13:12] some sort of a sea creature some sort of
[1:13:15] enormous whale or a shark or some big
[1:13:20] giant thing in the
[1:13:22] sea and in verses 1-8 chapter 41 God
[1:13:26] says how about this Leviathan he says
[1:13:29] can you catch him with a hook
[1:13:31] job he says can you put a hook in his
[1:13:33] nose can you play with him like a bird
[1:13:36] can you fill his skin with harpoons or
[1:13:38] his head with fishing Spears he's like
[1:13:40] how how do you measure up to just this
[1:13:41] big fish job he says lay your hands on
[1:13:44] him one
[1:13:46] time and remember the battle and then he
[1:13:49] says and you won't ever forget
[1:13:52] it Lord continues on in the same passion
[1:13:55] just making sure job knows who he's
[1:13:57] talking to and job continues to Humble
[1:14:00] himself remember the siap phenician
[1:14:02] woman when she came to
[1:14:05] Jesus and
[1:14:08] Jesus said basically like I'm not called
[1:14:11] to you
[1:14:13] people and then he called her a dog and
[1:14:16] she said
[1:14:18] Lord even the dogs eat from the master's
[1:14:20] table you see the nature of Jesus here
[1:14:23] and God's doing the same thing right
[1:14:24] here to Job chapter
[1:14:29] 42:1 job humbles himself again and shows
[1:14:32] his character then job answered the Lord
[1:14:35] and said I know that thou cast do
[1:14:38] everything and that no thought can be
[1:14:41] withholden from thee who is he that
[1:14:43] hideth the counsel without knowledge
[1:14:45] therefore have I uttered that I
[1:14:47] understood
[1:14:48] not things too wonderful for
[1:14:52] me which I knew not he's job is saying
[1:14:56] Lord all of these things that you're
[1:14:58] saying they're too great for me to
[1:15:02] understand he said here I beseech thee
[1:15:04] and I will speak job speaking he said I
[1:15:07] will demand of thee and declare thou
[1:15:09] unto me that's 1600's English Modern
[1:15:13] English would say that job is saying
[1:15:16] here Lord and I will here Lord listen to
[1:15:19] me and I will speak I will question you
[1:15:22] and I will and you will make it known to
[1:15:25] me I have heard of thee by the hearing
[1:15:28] of the year but now mine eye seeth thee
[1:15:32] wherefore I have bore myself and repent
[1:15:34] in dust and Ashes and it was so that
[1:15:37] after the Lord had spoken these word
[1:15:39] unto job that the Lord said unto elifaz
[1:15:42] the Tonite remember his first buddy
[1:15:44] there the first one that spoke now the
[1:15:46] Lord sets his eyes on him and he said my
[1:15:50] wrath is kindled against thee and
[1:15:52] against your two friends
[1:15:55] for you have not spoken of me the thing
[1:15:58] that is right as my servant job hath
[1:16:02] remember the experience that he had at
[1:16:06] night and he had this passed by him and
[1:16:09] he had this great powerful thing and
[1:16:12] God's like that wasn't
[1:16:19] me he says
[1:16:22] this and it was so that after the Lord
[1:16:25] where where are we verse eight verse let
[1:16:27] me read verse seven and it was so that
[1:16:30] after the Lord had spoken these words
[1:16:32] unto job that the Lord said to elifaz
[1:16:34] the Tonite my wrath is kindled against
[1:16:36] thee and against thy two friends for ye
[1:16:38] have not spoken of me the thing that is
[1:16:41] right as my servant job hath remember
[1:16:44] now elah who is not in this group
[1:16:47] therefore take unto you now seven
[1:16:49] Bullocks and seven Rams and go to my
[1:16:52] servant
[1:16:53] job the one that you've been persecuting
[1:16:56] the one that you've been calling a
[1:16:57] sinner the one that has lost everything
[1:17:01] now you go to him and offer up for
[1:17:04] yourselves burnt offering and my servant
[1:17:07] job shall pray for you for him will I
[1:17:11] accept lest I deal with you after your
[1:17:14] Folly in that ye have not spoken of me
[1:17:16] the thing which is right like my servant
[1:17:20] job I love that part all that job went
[1:17:25] through all their com condemnation God
[1:17:27] tells them to Humble themselves before
[1:17:29] job and have him pray for them there's
[1:17:32] another story in the Bible I just
[1:17:34] thought about it that uh Abraham and uh
[1:17:37] the king when Abraham lied about his
[1:17:40] wife being his sister and the King took
[1:17:44] Sarah to be his wife
[1:17:47] and all of a sudden all these bad things
[1:17:51] started to happen in his
[1:17:52] kingdom and God comes to this King and
[1:17:56] says you have another man's wife and the
[1:17:58] King's like wait a minute I didn't know
[1:17:59] he told me he was a sister and then God
[1:18:02] says well go and have him pray for
[1:18:04] you the one that lied Abraham because he
[1:18:08] was God's
[1:18:10] man so elifaz the
[1:18:13] Tonite and bildad the shuhite and zofar
[1:18:17] the nthite went and did according as the
[1:18:20] Lord commanded them the Lord also
[1:18:22] accepted job and the Lord turned the
[1:18:25] Captivity of job when he prayed for his
[1:18:29] friends also the lord gave job twice as
[1:18:32] much as he had
[1:18:35] before notice that job had something to
[1:18:39] do he had something to do in all this
[1:18:41] too he had repented he he he had humbled
[1:18:45] himself before the Lord but he had to
[1:18:48] pray for these guys that had been
[1:18:51] tormenting him look at the Spirit of
[1:18:54] Chris
[1:18:55] Christianity way back in job look at the
[1:18:58] nature of God he says now job now you
[1:19:01] pray for these ones that have been
[1:19:04] tormenting you wow and God wasn't going
[1:19:08] to bless job wasn't going to restore it
[1:19:11] until he did
[1:19:13] that Jesus said in Matthew
[1:19:17] 5:44 been going
[1:19:19] through The Sermon on the Mount this was
[1:19:23] Jesus was preaching this he said but I
[1:19:25] say unto you love your enemies bless
[1:19:27] them that curse you do good to them that
[1:19:31] hate you and pray for them which
[1:19:34] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:19:38] look at the spirit of God way back
[1:19:40] brother Aaron way
[1:19:42] back God's nature doesn't
[1:19:46] change so then God restored everything
[1:19:48] that was taken from job he receives
[1:19:50] twice of what he had before all this
[1:19:53] Calamity started except he received the
[1:19:55] same amount of
[1:19:57] children verse 11 Then There came unto
[1:20:00] him all his Brethren and all his sisters
[1:20:04] and all they that had been of his
[1:20:05] acquaintance before and did eat bread
[1:20:08] with him in his house and they bemoaned
[1:20:10] him and comforted him comforted him over
[1:20:13] all the evil that the Lord had brought
[1:20:16] upon him every man also gave him a piece
[1:20:18] of money and everyone an earring of gold
[1:20:22] and the Lord blessed the latter end of
[1:20:24] job more than his beginning for he had
[1:20:27] 14,000 sheep and 6,000 camels and a
[1:20:31] thousand Yol of oxen and a thousand she
[1:20:34] asses and he also had seven sons and
[1:20:37] three daughters and he called the name
[1:20:39] of the first jamaa in the name of the
[1:20:41] second Kizia and the third Karen
[1:20:48] hap and in all the land were no women
[1:20:51] found so fair as the daughters of job
[1:20:54] and their father father gave them
[1:20:55] inheritance among their Brethren after
[1:20:58] this lived job 140
[1:21:03] years and saw his sons and his sons Sons
[1:21:07] even four generations so job died being
[1:21:11] old and full of days what a book what an
[1:21:15] amazing story this man job had he went
[1:21:19] through some many things that none of us
[1:21:21] will ever go through but it's it's a
[1:21:24] it's an
[1:21:26] account of someone that had been so
[1:21:29] destitute and had so many problems and
[1:21:32] God
[1:21:34] himself was the one that said go ahead
[1:21:37] and do
[1:21:39] it very odd it happened but then job
[1:21:44] stuck with it job saw the
[1:21:48] resurrection job saw
[1:21:50] salvation job saw all of these things
[1:21:53] without a Bible I love that he looked
[1:21:58] out and saw
[1:22:01] nature and
[1:22:03] saw that there was a God and then God
[1:22:07] spoke directly to him he got to hear his
[1:22:09] voice the musicians can come and we'll
[1:22:12] close
[1:22:14] what a great and
[1:22:20] powerful
[1:22:21] man this man job was
[1:22:26] I think my favorite part in there is
[1:22:30] when job at the very end he had to pray
[1:22:33] for those people that hated him so much
[1:22:36] he had to show the spirit of
[1:22:38] Christ in job he had to show this before
[1:22:42] God could return those those blessings
[1:22:45] to him and then we see the nature of
[1:22:47] Satan in there how Satan's always
[1:22:49] worried about his own
[1:22:50] skin we see that come forward and job
[1:22:54] did didn't bow to it did job have
[1:22:57] weaknesses yes did job make mistakes yes
[1:23:01] was job perfect yes he was God looked
[1:23:06] down upon this man and saw a perfect
[1:23:09] servant even with all of his problems
