[35:26] have good to have all of our visitors in
[35:28] in service today it's
[35:31] uh that scripture that we have an
[35:34] advocate with the Lord we should never
[35:36] forget that what what a what a blessing
[35:40] it is to know that and that word that
[35:43] Advocate it means that Jesus is doing
[35:46] something he's doing something for us
[35:48] and he also expects us to do something
[35:53] in for each
[35:56] other and
[35:58] with these kids I was watching these
[36:00] kids sing and and seeing them go out and
[36:04] I was thinking Lord I'm for these kids I
[36:08] want to be an advocate for these kids I
[36:11] want to do everything that I can to help
[36:13] these kids because they are the Next
[36:15] Generation if the Lord would T and if we
[36:18] think so often we hear about Revival we
[36:22] we we we like that word it seems like
[36:24] everybody likes to think of a Revival
[36:27] happening a Revival is something that's
[36:29] Reviving something that's already inside
[36:33] of you and stirring it up and and
[36:36] getting it moving and getting it out and
[36:38] if we want a Revival let me ask for
[36:41] those of you that know what a Revival is
[36:44] who would like to have a
[36:47] Revival I raise my hand too to have a
[36:50] Revival we've got to do Revival
[36:53] things we don't just sit we don't just
[36:56] do nothing
[36:58] we have to do things that can produce a
[37:01] Revival we had a men's meeting yesterday
[37:03] it's such a blessing with with the
[37:05] brothers and just seeing that feeling
[37:08] the energy in in the the brothers and
[37:12] and how they want to do things and
[37:14] that's what we need to Foster in our
[37:16] church not just as I said not just
[37:19] coming to church when you come to church
[37:21] be part of church don't just come to to
[37:24] hear a sermon or don't just come to sing
[37:27] you be part of this ministry and don't
[37:30] don't just let it let it sit be an
[37:34] advocate be and help other people there
[37:38] was this man way back in the turn of the
[37:41] century 19 around 1900 his name was
[37:45] Charles param he was a famous
[37:49] Pentecostal type they didn't have a
[37:52] Pentecostal denomination back then but
[37:54] he was uh he was advocate for speaking
[37:56] in tongues and and and he was just a
[37:58] well-respected minister in the United
[38:01] States at that time the late 1800s early
[38:04] 1900s and he met a
[38:06] man that um he
[38:09] saw hope in he saw potential in this
[38:14] young man this is in the jimm Crow laws
[38:18] this is uh this this man this young man
[38:20] was a black was a
[38:23] black man with he he had lost his eye to
[38:27] small poox and he this man par of me saw
[38:32] that there was some there was potential
[38:35] in this man his name is William
[38:37] Seymour and there back then it was the
[38:40] the segregation laws the Jim Crow laws
[38:42] so the blacks weren't allowed to to mix
[38:44] with the whites they weren't allowed to
[38:45] have integrated Services they weren't
[38:47] even allowed to be in the same schools
[38:48] together so Charles param he started
[38:52] this school down in Texas and he invited
[38:55] this young man that he wanted to invest
[38:58] in he invited him to come into school
[39:00] now it would have caused big problems if
[39:02] the young man would have been in the
[39:04] classroom but he say you know what we'll
[39:05] get past that you can sit right here in
[39:07] the doorway and you can listen to these
[39:11] to these um lessons and the young man
[39:14] William Seymour started continued to
[39:17] grow in the Lord and the other people
[39:22] saw that this man had a lot of
[39:26] potential so So eventually he was
[39:28] offered a pastorship position in Los
[39:32] Angeles now I believe he was in Houston
[39:34] and this church the uh the pastor was a
[39:37] woman and and she wanted to go out on
[39:39] the missionary field I believe it was
[39:41] Liberia Africa and she invited this this
[39:46] uh William Seymour to come and be pastor
[39:48] of this church that she was pastoring so
[39:52] Seymour comes out gets to Los
[39:55] Angeles and he preaches
[39:58] sermon and they were like you know what
[40:00] we don't want him we don't want this
[40:04] this isn't like what we're used to this
[40:05] isn't like our way of thinking this
[40:08] isn't like what what we grew up with so
[40:10] no you know what you can't be our pastor
[40:12] you preached this one sermon you can't
[40:14] be our pastor so you know what they did
[40:16] they padlocked the
[40:17] doors so Seymour couldn't come in
[40:19] anymore so he was devastated he he
[40:22] didn't have a way back home he was poor
[40:24] as a church mouse he didn't he he
[40:25] couldn't pay his way back back so some
[40:29] other people he meets some other
[40:31] people and they say well let's have a
[40:33] Bible study let's have a prayer service
[40:35] in our
[40:36] home so he goes there and they start
[40:40] praying
[40:41] together after a little while the group
[40:43] gets too big for the house they move to
[40:46] another
[40:47] house the group continues to grow and
[40:50] get bigger pretty soon there's people
[40:53] standing outside the windows they open
[40:55] the windows there's people out outside
[40:57] there and they're listening to the
[40:59] sermon and they're worshiping and it
[41:01] grew up so big that there were so many
[41:02] people out in the back porch one day
[41:04] that it collapsed from all the weight on
[41:07] it so then they said well we got to get
[41:09] a bigger place so they moved to downtown
[41:12] Los Angeles on a street called isua
[41:16] Street and they got this big warehouse
[41:19] and they started the isua Street
[41:21] Revival because I believe that this man
[41:24] Charles param even though they separated
[41:26] ways and they didn't
[41:27] agree later on he saw
[41:31] hope and he saw potential in that young
[41:34] man William Seymour seeing these kids
[41:39] what
[41:41] potential they have and and I can't help
[41:44] it brothers and sisters I see potential
[41:46] in every single person in this building
[41:48] without
[41:49] exception every single
[41:52] one and I believe that's how the Lord
[41:54] Jesus really sees in us there was a
[41:58] Catholic man believe his name was
[42:01] Ingram in Jeffersonville Indiana way
[42:04] back just a little while after this
[42:06] happened there was
[42:08] a a fire that this church in
[42:10] Jeffersonville burnt down and there's
[42:13] this group of people the pastor of the
[42:15] church says he gets out of Dodge because
[42:19] his his building had burned down he had
[42:21] no way to pay for it so he ups and
[42:23] leaves and he leaves this young man here
[42:28] that was an associate pastor and with
[42:31] this 20 people or so with no Pastor no
[42:34] building no
[42:35] nothing well this Catholic man that had
[42:39] a that that was an influential in the
[42:41] city and he had a lot of money he sees
[42:43] potential in this young Minister named
[42:46] William
[42:47] Brandon and he says I'll tell you what
[42:50] I'll help you build a
[42:52] church and he provides the
[42:54] money provides the land on a on a
[42:57] alone and I don't know if he eventually
[43:00] just gave the church but but that was in
[43:02] 1933 and they started building the
[43:03] brandom Tabernacle and it it started it
[43:06] didn't really when I say it started to
[43:08] grow it grew a little bit when they got
[43:11] it finished in third sometime in 1934
[43:14] they started having Services there
[43:17] rather than in a tent just down the
[43:20] street and other people started to
[43:23] believe in this
[43:25] man and then
[43:29] 1947 that happened in
[43:33] 1933 years
[43:35] later 14 years later in
[43:40] 1947 that is
[43:42] when his ministry started to take off
[43:46] that's when his the Revival that came
[43:49] after brother brandham started this
[43:51] charismatic Revival and it swept all
[43:52] over the world and just people after
[43:56] thousands of people were healed and
[43:58] thousands of people gave their hearts to
[43:59] the Lord really because just a few
[44:01] people believed in this man at the very
[44:06] beginning very few but somebody did and
[44:10] then later on we see this we call it the
[44:14] Jesus
[44:16] movement and this
[44:20] hippie shows
[44:23] up drug addicted homos
[44:27] seual
[44:29] hippie shows up to this man's
[44:33] house and this man didn't want to accept
[44:37] him at the beginning but his his I
[44:39] believe it was his daughter had met him
[44:41] and this young man his name was Lonnie
[44:43] frisbee had a calling in his
[44:46] life and this P this man that had this
[44:51] Lonnie frisbee show up to his house was
[44:53] the pastor of a church with about 25
[44:56] people in it
[44:58] and he welcomed this hippie
[45:02] boy into this congregation because he
[45:06] saw a a realness in this young
[45:09] man and this young man started preaching
[45:12] the pastor's name was Chuck Smith this
[45:15] young man started preaching and led
[45:18] thousands upon
[45:21] thousands of hippies and other people to
[45:24] the Lord Jesus and they changed their
[45:26] way of life brother R believe are you
[45:28] from that that Movement we have one and
[45:31] there's
[45:33] many that we know that came from that
[45:37] movement because somebody believed in
[45:42] these
[45:42] people someone were were these people
[45:46] were
[45:47] willing to make a sacrifice and make an
[45:53] effort that this young one of these
[45:57] young men or a young lady or whatever it
[45:59] might be could actually do something
[46:04] great at one after the other and we see
[46:07] that none of them would have been able
[46:08] to do it if somebody didn't believe
[46:11] him Jesus in each of these cases the
[46:15] people who invested in these Souls they
[46:19] didn't try to make these people emulate
[46:22] themselves they didn't try this Ingram
[46:25] that helped brother brandom he didn't
[46:27] try to make brother brandom a
[46:29] Catholic he helped him William Seymour
[46:33] those that supported him they didn't try
[46:35] to make William Seymour a Methodist or
[46:37] whatever it is they they they just
[46:40] supported as the Lord led
[46:42] him with with this Jesus movement in the
[46:47] 60 late 60s and 70s they didn't try this
[46:51] this um Chuck Smith didn't try to make
[46:54] these people like him that came from the
[46:56] Four Square
[46:58] movement he didn't try to make them like
[47:00] him he supported the calling that he had
[47:05] in his life may sound
[47:07] strange to hear that but it's true and
[47:12] God used these people and as I said if
[47:15] you want a
[47:18] Revival in your life if you want a
[47:21] Revival in church you have to look back
[47:23] and you have to do Revival
[47:25] things that let's not sit around and be
[47:29] happy with the way you are you need to
[47:32] do Revival things you need to to make it
[47:35] where the Lord can use you whether
[47:37] you're supporting someone else or
[47:39] whether you're doing it there has to be
[47:42] change to have a
[47:46] Revival
[47:48] Jesus he was
[47:50] walking through the
[47:54] city and he saw potential
[47:57] in this little short guy named
[48:01] zakus he sees him and of course the Lord
[48:05] Jesus was God in flesh and he could see
[48:08] the inner thoughts but he sees this man
[48:10] zakus and this man was hated he was the
[48:13] chief of the the tax collectors in the
[48:16] area of Jericho this man was a crook he
[48:19] was a sinner he was an what we would
[48:22] call an awful person yet Jesus is
[48:24] walking by and Zak he has heard about
[48:27] this man Jesus and he's like I want to
[48:29] see him but he's too short and the the
[48:30] crowd's too big he climbs up in this
[48:33] sycamore tree and he's watching as Jesus
[48:35] is coming and Jesus looks up and he sees
[48:39] zakus and he saw potential in that
[48:42] little man as much of a sinner as he was
[48:46] and he looks up and he says zakus come
[48:48] down he says I want to go to your
[48:52] house and that day zakus changed
[48:56] zakus brought him
[48:59] in and made food and he and and he
[49:02] repented we've been going over
[49:03] repentance not only did he he feel bad
[49:07] for what he had
[49:08] done he also made a change in his life
[49:12] and he said Lord I'll
[49:13] repay I'll repay everything anything
[49:17] that I've done wrong to anyone I am
[49:19] ready to pay it back we see the change
[49:22] in zakus and you know what Jesus says to
[49:25] him he he looks at
[49:27] zakus and he says this day salvation has
[49:31] come to your
[49:32] house and that same salvation that same
[49:35] man the Bible tells us that he is the
[49:36] same yesterday and today and forever and
[49:39] he is the same one that can come into
[49:41] our homes he's the same same person
[49:44] Jesus started a
[49:47] Revival and to start a Revival you got
[49:50] to do Revival things and there's things
[49:53] that sometimes they are not comfortable
[49:57] the um the Bible
[50:01] says Jesus was talking about the end
[50:04] times and he said that you Compass the
[50:07] sea he was looking at the Pharisees and
[50:09] the Sadducees and the scribes and he
[50:10] says you'll go all the way across the
[50:12] ocean to make one proelite a proelite is
[50:17] someone that you convert from one Church
[50:19] to another
[50:20] church and he says you'll cross the sea
[50:23] just to get one and you'll be so proud
[50:25] of that one and you'll get that one
[50:27] person you'll convince that one person
[50:29] to think like
[50:30] you and he says you make him twofold
[50:32] more of a child of Hell than you are
[50:34] yourselves oh that's what Jesus that's
[50:38] what Jesus
[50:40] said it's not trying to make someone
[50:43] mimic you or emulate you it's trying to
[50:47] get that person support that person to
[50:50] get to Jesus Christ that was a Revival
[50:54] type statement that Jesus said and look
[50:57] what he did he invested Jesus called
[50:59] Jesus invested in the callings of his
[51:01] disciples he invested in the calling of
[51:04] Peter and James and John and a and
[51:05] Matthew and Nathaniel and
[51:08] Phillip Jesus invested in
[51:12] them and they are the ones that took the
[51:15] message of Jesus Christ and spread it
[51:18] around the
[51:19] world they are the ones who took the
[51:22] Revival to the world because Jesus
[51:25] Christ believed in them he was an
[51:29] advocate of them and we always think
[51:31] well I don't have I don't have this gift
[51:33] I don't have that gift when we say that
[51:36] we're looking at
[51:38] ourselves and it is taught it is in
[51:40] human nature to always look at ourselves
[51:44] and I say it many times and I know you
[51:45] probably get tired of me saying it it
[51:47] ain't about
[51:49] you it's not it's about the cause it's
[51:52] about Christ and when you're always
[51:54] thinking well I'm not good at this or or
[51:56] I fail here or I failed there you're
[51:57] thinking about
[51:59] yourself and you're not thinking about
[52:01] the other person that you can invest
[52:07] in Jesus invested in his disciples and
[52:10] they took the message to the
[52:12] world that is what
[52:15] Christianity that's what it's about
[52:18] Jesus said himself he said prefer
[52:20] another man's wealth over your
[52:24] own I always thought when I read that as
[52:26] a kid I always thought wow you're
[52:28] supposed to want that guy's
[52:34] money no you're not you're supposed to
[52:39] want that you wantan to you want that
[52:41] person to succeed more than you want
[52:43] yourself to succeed how many people
[52:46] think like
[52:48] that but Jesus said you prefer another
[52:51] man's wealth over your
[52:54] own and it's almost
[52:57] never Revival it's almost never going
[53:01] out into the streets and witnessing and
[53:03] and and passing out tracks that's good
[53:06] and some people come in like that but it
[53:09] starts at home it starts at your with
[53:12] your family it starts with your children
[53:14] it starts with your friends your cousins
[53:16] your colleagues at work you invest your
[53:19] time into them you invest your love into
[53:22] those people and then you you start
[53:27] something in
[53:28] them and then it
[53:31] flourishes do you know
[53:34] someone who you could invest your time
[53:37] to do you know someone that needs it you
[53:41] do every single one of you everybody's
[53:43] looking at me every single one of you
[53:45] does now let's pause for a second think
[53:47] about who that person is that could
[53:49] really use you that could really use
[53:51] some help that could really use some of
[53:53] your time that could really use some of
[53:55] your prayers think about them that's how
[53:58] a Revival starts there's a parable in
[54:02] the
[54:03] Bible that Jesus talks
[54:06] about investing and he talks about how
[54:10] that that the kingdom he F first of all
[54:13] he's he tells the he tells the story in
[54:16] Luke
[54:18] and it was it was right after
[54:21] zakus and Jesus says that salvation has
[54:25] come to your home and and then he's
[54:26] walking and he's walking into the
[54:28] Jerusalem and the people are saying wow
[54:29] the Kingdom of Heaven is now it's going
[54:31] to happen and they get all excited and
[54:33] Jesus says wait a minute he says hold
[54:36] on there's something else that has to
[54:38] happen
[54:40] before and then he tells the story in
[54:42] Luke and he tells it in Matthew let's go
[54:43] to Matthew chapter 25 and read the story
[54:48] that Jesus
[54:49] tells this Parable we're on this series
[54:53] these series of Parables and this is a
[54:56] parable that we should apply to our
[54:59] lives Matthew chap
[55:11] 25:13 Jesus says this watch
[55:15] therefore for ye know neither the day
[55:18] nor the hour wherein the son of man
[55:20] cometh for the Kingdom of Heaven he's
[55:23] like be
[55:25] ready because this the second coming of
[55:27] Christ is at
[55:29] hand watch therefore for you know not
[55:32] the day nor the hour when the son of man
[55:33] cometh for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a
[55:35] man traveling into a far country who
[55:38] called his own servants and delivered
[55:40] unto them his goods and unto one he gave
[55:43] five talents these are bags of gold
[55:47] okay unto one he gave five talents unto
[55:51] another to another two and to another
[55:54] one and to every man ACC according to
[55:56] his several ability and straightway took
[56:00] his journey so he gives these bag of
[56:02] gold to the servants and they each had
[56:04] different levels of ability and notice
[56:07] the master didn't tell the
[56:09] servants what to do with the
[56:12] gold he didn't give them instructions he
[56:15] just gives them the gold with the
[56:17] assumption that they're not going to
[56:19] know what to
[56:20] do and he gave the one with the highest
[56:22] ability the most and he gave the one
[56:24] that maybe had lesser ability
[56:26] the
[56:27] least then he that had received the five
[56:30] talents went and traded with the same
[56:33] and made them other five talents so he
[56:37] took the five talents he invested it and
[56:39] he made and he doubled his money and
[56:42] likewise he that received two talents he
[56:44] gained also other two so this man with
[56:47] two talents he also received he he
[56:50] invested and got two talents now he was
[56:52] gone for a long time and after a long
[56:55] time
[56:56] the lord of the those servants cometh
[56:59] and and reckon with them I'm sorry I
[57:01] skipped verse one of the most important
[57:04] verses
[57:06] 18 now enemy trying to make me miss the
[57:10] most important part I'll start with 17
[57:12] and likewise he that received two he
[57:14] also gained two but he that had received
[57:17] one went and digged in the earth and hid
[57:20] the Lord's
[57:22] money after a long
[57:24] time the lord of the those servants
[57:26] cometh and reckon with with them now
[57:29] they had not heard back from this ruler
[57:32] for probably many many
[57:34] years they had
[57:36] taken what he had given them they knew
[57:40] that this was a gift that they were
[57:41] given they knew that they had to
[57:43] multiply this they knew that he was
[57:44] going to come back and Jesus is telling
[57:47] the story when they thought hey the the
[57:49] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he's like
[57:51] wait a minute listen to
[57:53] this and he invested and he each one of
[57:56] these
[57:57] invested
[57:59] in something that that that propagated
[58:04] the Lord's money
[58:08] and you
[58:10] notice when we're going to bring this
[58:13] back to witnessing to someone notice you
[58:15] don't just tell them about
[58:19] Jesus you if you see potential in a
[58:22] person you invest in that person you're
[58:25] not just going out and witnessing you
[58:28] have a friend that needs help you stay
[58:30] with that person your your children you
[58:33] continue to encourage them to serve the
[58:35] Lord you're always in you're always
[58:37] doing something so then that investment
[58:40] will come to
[58:42] fruition and so he that had received
[58:46] five talents came and brought other five
[58:48] talents saying Lord thou Deliver Us unto
[58:50] me five talents behold I have gained
[58:52] beside them five talents more his lord
[58:55] said unto to him well done thou good and
[58:58] faithful servant thou H has been
[59:00] Faithful over a few things I will make
[59:02] thee R ruler over many things enter thou
[59:06] into the joy of the
[59:10] Lord so he's saying hey I invested in
[59:14] you in my investment I had a return on
[59:17] my investment just like Charles parm did
[59:19] for William Seymour you made he made he
[59:22] made a lot of investment in him and then
[59:24] he received far more of a return earn on
[59:27] this man he also that had received two
[59:29] talents came and said Lord thou deliver
[59:31] unto me two talents behold I have gained
[59:34] two other talents beside them the Lord
[59:36] said unto him well done good and
[59:38] faithful servant thou has been Faithful
[59:40] over a few things I will make thee ruler
[59:43] over many things enter thou into the joy
[59:46] of the Lord then he which had received
[59:49] one Talent came and said Lord I knew
[59:51] thee that thou art a hard man reaping
[59:55] where thou Hast not sown and Gathering
[59:58] where thou Hast not
[1:00:01] straw Chuck Smith the pastor of Calvary
[1:00:05] Chapel had invited this man
[1:00:10] in he had
[1:00:13] only like 25 people they were tithe
[1:00:16] paying members and then when he started
[1:00:18] bringing these other people in those
[1:00:20] tith paying members those important
[1:00:22] people they started
[1:00:24] leaving and he made this commitment to
[1:00:27] these people he said no I'm going to
[1:00:28] stand firm I believe in this I believe
[1:00:30] that these are souls I I want I have a
[1:00:33] burden for them we are going to stay the
[1:00:36] course and he continued
[1:00:39] on he invested in them and many of of
[1:00:42] those people there was only as I said
[1:00:44] there's only about 25 they they left and
[1:00:47] remember think about how it's shrinking
[1:00:48] and think about these hippies they don't
[1:00:50] have any money they don't have anything
[1:00:51] to
[1:00:52] contribute but with this man it wasn't
[1:00:55] about that
[1:01:00] and this man continues
[1:01:03] on and he's there and he's with the
[1:01:06] master and he he has this bag of gold
[1:01:09] and he says here you go he says I knew I
[1:01:12] was I knew that that you're a hard man I
[1:01:15] knew that there was punishment there if
[1:01:16] I lost anything so I buried it and
[1:01:19] here's your
[1:01:21] gold fruits of the spirit we think about
[1:01:23] the fruits of the spirit he might have
[1:01:26] had the fruits of the spirit he had the
[1:01:29] gold but he didn't do anything with them
[1:01:33] it was all about
[1:01:35] himself he just didn't want to get in
[1:01:37] trouble and I was afraid and I went and
[1:01:39] I hid thy talent in the earth and lo
[1:01:42] there Hast that is thine and the Lord
[1:01:44] answered him thou Wicked and slothful
[1:01:47] servant thou
[1:01:49] keepest thou knewest that I reap where I
[1:01:54] sowed and thou ought therefore to have
[1:01:58] put where I swed and gather where I have
[1:02:00] I have not straw thou oughtest therefore
[1:02:03] to have put my money to the exchangers
[1:02:05] and then coming I should have received
[1:02:07] my own with Usery so he say you may not
[1:02:09] be a preacher you may not be a
[1:02:10] businessman you may not be a theologian
[1:02:13] but you could have at least grown my
[1:02:14] investment you could at least earn some
[1:02:16] interest on it but you were too afraid
[1:02:18] to do
[1:02:19] anything where are the fruits of my
[1:02:21] investment in
[1:02:23] you take therefore the the talent from
[1:02:26] him and give it to the one that had 10
[1:02:28] talents for unto everyone that shall
[1:02:30] everyone that hath shall be given and he
[1:02:32] that shall have and he shall have
[1:02:34] abundance but from him that hath not
[1:02:37] shall be taken away even that which he
[1:02:40] hath and cast ye the unprofitable
[1:02:42] servant into outer darkness and there
[1:02:44] shall be weeping and nashing of
[1:02:48] teeth punishment were
[1:02:52] severe
[1:02:54] and we think
[1:02:56] of what happened why did Jesus tell the
[1:03:00] story he was afraid brother Michael
[1:03:03] sings that song um I'm no longer a slave
[1:03:07] to
[1:03:09] fear fear can destroy us fear makes it
[1:03:13] if you're afraid of how your church is
[1:03:14] going to think you're you're afraid of
[1:03:16] of failure you're afraid of that
[1:03:18] somebody's going to reject you and yet
[1:03:21] this young this man that had the one
[1:03:22] Talent he was
[1:03:24] afraid and look at the
[1:03:26] ultimate destination that he
[1:03:30] had it's a it's a a frightening
[1:03:35] thing so we look and I'm I'm sorry I'm
[1:03:40] just
[1:03:43] gonna the notes the the computer thing
[1:03:46] messed me
[1:03:49] up people are important brothers and
[1:03:51] sisters and we are here for a purpose
[1:03:54] this church is here for a purpose this
[1:03:56] potluck is there for a purpose the the
[1:03:58] men's meeting we had yesterday is here
[1:04:00] for a purpose we are to serve one
[1:04:02] another the fruits of the spirit all of
[1:04:04] them are for other people they're not
[1:04:06] for us we look and we say well love joy
[1:04:08] peace well do I have these things I
[1:04:10] don't know if I have these things
[1:04:11] they're not for
[1:04:12] you there are to be given out a fruit
[1:04:15] what is a fruit for a fruit grows on a
[1:04:19] tree it's to feed something else it's
[1:04:22] not to feed
[1:04:23] ourselves this I'm going to tell this
[1:04:25] story of this fig tree here in a minute
[1:04:27] the Fig Tree this a fig tree grows up
[1:04:30] and it Bears it's supposed to bear fruit
[1:04:32] if it doesn't bear fruit then that fig
[1:04:34] tree is no good and so often I think
[1:04:37] that all of us we're all leaves and no
[1:04:40] figs might cover the
[1:04:43] trunk but is it helping someone
[1:04:48] else Luke Chapter
[1:04:50] 13 this parable of the fig tree
[1:05:00] verse
[1:05:02] six he spake also this Parable a certain
[1:05:04] man had a fig tree planted in his
[1:05:07] Vineyard and he came and sought fruit
[1:05:09] thereon and found
[1:05:11] none this by the
[1:05:13] way
[1:05:15] this has been such a blessing to
[1:05:18] me it's just a few sentences but as I
[1:05:22] have studied this and thought about this
[1:05:24] over the past few
[1:05:26] days I've thought about the advocate of
[1:05:28] Jesus Christ and I've thought about all
[1:05:31] all that we do here in the church and I
[1:05:34] I just I was taken
[1:05:36] back and he spake this Parable read it
[1:05:38] again a certain man had a fig tree
[1:05:40] planted in his Vineyard and he came and
[1:05:42] sought fruit fruit thereon and he found
[1:05:46] none then he said unto the dresser of
[1:05:48] his Vineyard behold these three years I
[1:05:51] come seeking fruit on this fig tree and
[1:05:53] found none I cut it down and he says cut
[1:05:56] it down why cth the
[1:05:58] ground he says I've looked at this tree
[1:06:01] it gets leaves the leaves fall off
[1:06:03] there's no fruit the thing is just
[1:06:05] worthless and it's taking up a space I
[1:06:07] could cut it off and I could put another
[1:06:09] tree that'll bear fruit
[1:06:13] there then he said then he said under
[1:06:16] the dresser three years this is happened
[1:06:20] and the and the dresser the man that was
[1:06:22] working answered and said unto him Lord
[1:06:25] let it alone this year
[1:06:29] also till I shall dig about it and dung
[1:06:32] it and if it bear fruit well and if not
[1:06:35] then after that you can cut it down look
[1:06:39] at this
[1:06:40] advocate of this man that's working in
[1:06:42] this in this Orchard he this this this
[1:06:45] the owner he comes it's like God the
[1:06:47] father he comes down he says you're
[1:06:49] sinning I'm I'm sick and tired of you
[1:06:51] this is It's grieve the Lord and here
[1:06:54] here he is ready to to take out this
[1:06:56] tree because it's not bearing fruit and
[1:06:59] here is the person working in the orch
[1:07:01] say wait wait wait Lord wait wait wait
[1:07:03] wait let me give it a little time let me
[1:07:07] give it a little love let me dig
[1:07:10] around the tree put some fertilizer
[1:07:14] there so I can get some water and then
[1:07:17] and then if it's after a year then you
[1:07:19] can cut it
[1:07:21] down lord just wait just don't do it
[1:07:26] I
[1:07:27] remember my my grandfather had he had an
[1:07:29] orchard of pecan trees and the trees
[1:07:33] started they wouldn't bear fruit they
[1:07:36] they would bear a little bit so my
[1:07:38] grandpa was getting old and he told me
[1:07:40] he says Hey can can you if I pay you can
[1:07:42] you come dig the wells I was like yeah
[1:07:44] I'm not pay you I'll go dig the wells so
[1:07:46] I went out and I dug these big
[1:07:48] wells around the pecan trees put some
[1:07:52] mulch in there and took it took care so
[1:07:54] they could get water in there and they
[1:07:56] started thriving and they started they
[1:07:59] started bearing fruit and they started
[1:08:00] doing
[1:08:02] well think about that what Jesus isn't
[1:08:04] talking so we be
[1:08:07] gardeners he's talking about us and we
[1:08:10] have an advocate in Jesus Christ and and
[1:08:13] here we are we're Sinners and we've live
[1:08:14] lived our life under this place and
[1:08:16] we've failed and we've done wrong and
[1:08:17] we've messed up and all of these things
[1:08:19] and and here is our time comes and here
[1:08:22] is our Africa Jesus Christ and says wait
[1:08:24] wait wait
[1:08:26] wait give me a little time give me a
[1:08:29] little time with
[1:08:31] them and that's what we should do if we
[1:08:33] have the spirit of Christ should we not
[1:08:34] do it for each other we see people
[1:08:37] failing we see people not bearing fruit
[1:08:39] we see problems in the church we see
[1:08:41] problems in our friends wait wait wait
[1:08:44] Lord have
[1:08:45] mercy I'll do something I'll help this
[1:08:49] person I'll reach out to this person and
[1:08:52] then if they're not called if they're
[1:08:53] not one of your elect then Lord then you
[1:08:55] can cut them down but just give me a
[1:08:57] little bit more time how many of us have
[1:09:00] that that calling and that burden for
[1:09:02] other
[1:09:03] people I know some of you
[1:09:06] do and I've seen it but we should all
[1:09:09] have that burden just like the man with
[1:09:11] the
[1:09:12] talents the one with with with the five
[1:09:16] talents with the five bags of gold he
[1:09:19] knew what to do he put it to work he he
[1:09:21] wor he worked hard and he wanted to to
[1:09:23] propagate this he wanted the Master to
[1:09:25] have more when he came back the other
[1:09:28] one said I'm good I'm fine I'm going to
[1:09:30] bury my blessings and and I'm just going
[1:09:32] to leave them there all the fruits of
[1:09:34] the spirit all the word of God I'm just
[1:09:36] going to bury it and it's not going to
[1:09:38] do anybody else any good but
[1:09:41] me that's what these parables are
[1:09:45] saying they're saying Get Out work for
[1:09:49] each other why would Jesus tell us
[1:09:51] something like
[1:09:52] that do you think maybe because he cared
[1:09:56] do you think maybe because he loves his
[1:09:58] people do you think maybe because he's
[1:10:01] gone he's not gone but he's not here in
[1:10:04] the flesh but he sent his Spirit
[1:10:07] down to to spread the gospel he said
[1:10:10] Tell The World about me he said preach
[1:10:14] the gospel he he came and did it for
[1:10:16] three and a half years now he said now
[1:10:17] you go do it he was one man when he was
[1:10:20] in the flesh but it went around the
[1:10:23] world in a Revival when that same spirit
[1:10:27] that Christ had went into the people and
[1:10:29] they started digging around the
[1:10:31] trees look at Jesus with Mary Magdalene
[1:10:35] I mean as bad as you can
[1:10:37] be Jesus
[1:10:39] father give me some time with her and he
[1:10:42] goes out he
[1:10:44] digs around the well so she can get
[1:10:47] water so she can get nutrients and then
[1:10:51] that barren fig tree started bearing
[1:10:54] fruit
[1:10:56] look at look at Peter we went through
[1:10:58] Peter I believe it was last
[1:11:01] week Peter's there and I mean a cussing
[1:11:06] fisherman and he's out there and and he
[1:11:09] fishes all night no fish and and he's
[1:11:11] upset and his and his brother Andrew and
[1:11:13] then their Partners Jame James and John
[1:11:15] they had their boat Peter and Andrew had
[1:11:17] their boat they fish all night then
[1:11:19] they're not catching anything
[1:11:21] and they're they're tending their Nets
[1:11:24] and here comes Jesus Christ walking
[1:11:26] along the
[1:11:28] shore and he says hey he says let's go
[1:11:31] out into the
[1:11:34] water Jesus saw something in
[1:11:37] Peter he saw that this tree can bear
[1:11:42] fruit even though we would have never
[1:11:45] seen it he saw there was something about
[1:11:48] this
[1:11:49] man so they go out and they go into the
[1:11:51] deep
[1:11:52] water Jesus Peter didn't know he was
[1:11:55] wasn't a disciple yet there was
[1:11:57] something though that there was a little
[1:11:59] bit there that that that Jesus had done
[1:12:01] some work around the around the base of
[1:12:03] that
[1:12:05] tree they get out in he says let's go
[1:12:07] out into the deeper water Peter's like
[1:12:09] there's no fish out in the deeper water
[1:12:12] let's go out in the deeper water he's
[1:12:13] like okay and he says cast your nets
[1:12:15] over Peter's
[1:12:18] like we fished all night there's no fish
[1:12:23] there Jesus said just do it
[1:12:26] Peter they lower their
[1:12:29] Nets they start pulling back the Nets
[1:12:32] there's Peter and John in the boat
[1:12:34] they're pulling them this is
[1:12:36] heavy pull uh
[1:12:39] Peter um not Peter and John Peter and
[1:12:41] Andrew and they're pulling and and
[1:12:43] Andrew's like Peter I can't get this up
[1:12:45] there's a lot of fish in here so there's
[1:12:47] the boat of John and a John and James
[1:12:49] over there they're like hey John James
[1:12:51] come over here and help us so they come
[1:12:52] over and they start pulling up this net
[1:12:54] and is just full of fish and they get it
[1:12:57] into the boat it fills the boat up and
[1:12:59] what does Peter do that that mulch that
[1:13:01] had gone around the tree Peter falls
[1:13:03] down and he says I'm not
[1:13:06] worthy he says just leave Jesus you
[1:13:09] shouldn't be in the same boat as me I'm
[1:13:12] not worthy to be anywhere near
[1:13:15] you Peter said or or Jesus
[1:13:19] said he saysf follow me and I will make
[1:13:23] you fishes of men see he saw that
[1:13:26] potential he saw what Peter could be he
[1:13:29] saw what James could be he saw what John
[1:13:31] could be then he goes and he's walking
[1:13:33] and he sees he comes by Matthew this tax
[1:13:35] collector remember zius he was a creep
[1:13:39] and he changed and Here Comes Here Comes
[1:13:41] Jesus and he's walking by this this tax
[1:13:45] collector I wonder if Matthew had
[1:13:47] already been a disciple by the time he
[1:13:49] got to zakus I believe but I wonder if
[1:13:52] Matthew had some compassion on zakus too
[1:13:56] maybe saw some potential
[1:13:58] there Peter or Jesus is walking by the
[1:14:01] the money changers and hears the crooks
[1:14:04] and they're cheating the people he looks
[1:14:06] down tells Matthew says come follow me
[1:14:09] Matthew drops it Jesus saw something in
[1:14:14] Matthew comes to Phillip he walks by
[1:14:16] philli he says Phillip come follow me
[1:14:19] now watch the fruit that Philip Bears
[1:14:22] Philip goes and he sees he he sees Jesus
[1:14:24] Jesus Jus says come follow me Philip
[1:14:26] drops everything he follows Jesus he
[1:14:28] goes to his friend Phillip saw that he
[1:14:31] had he he saw in his friend he he
[1:14:34] thought that there is potential in my
[1:14:36] friend
[1:14:37] Nathaniel so he
[1:14:39] goes and he finds Nathaniel and he looks
[1:14:42] and there's Nathaniel And he was under a
[1:14:43] fig tree and he was
[1:14:47] praying Philip
[1:14:51] stops wow there he is sees
[1:14:56] potential and he goes and he tells him
[1:14:58] and he says
[1:15:00] hey I met this
[1:15:03] man Jesus of Nazareth Nathaniel's like
[1:15:06] what do you mean Jesus of Naz Nazareth
[1:15:08] he say what good could come out of that
[1:15:10] place no no no no no no just come and
[1:15:14] see Phillip had
[1:15:17] confidence and then Nathaniel gets up
[1:15:21] there and all he needed to do is had
[1:15:23] have dug around the well a little bit
[1:15:25] have a little a little bit somebody that
[1:15:26] cares and Philip provided that
[1:15:28] Nathaniel's walking
[1:15:31] up he says and Jesus looks at him he
[1:15:33] says behold an Israelite and whom know
[1:15:35] your no
[1:15:37] gel's like how did you know me and he
[1:15:40] says when you were under the Fig
[1:15:45] Tree when Philip called you he said I
[1:15:48] saw you
[1:15:50] there Lord and you see fruit was born
[1:15:54] right there he recognized he recognized
[1:15:58] that and
[1:16:00] then the Apostle
[1:16:02] Paul later on how many people that we we
[1:16:05] could go through we could I could go
[1:16:06] through all o over and over and over so
[1:16:09] many people that they had potential and
[1:16:12] God saw that potential the Apostle Paul
[1:16:14] God saw saw potential in that man here
[1:16:16] he is he's coming and Not only was was
[1:16:19] he not bearing fruit I mean there was
[1:16:21] Cactus growing all around Paul he was
[1:16:25] sticky he was he he hated he had a bad
[1:16:28] attitude he was worse than all of them
[1:16:31] and here comes Jesus and he says you
[1:16:33] know what I'm gonna dig around a little
[1:16:36] bit I'm gonna cut these cactuses
[1:16:39] out and he
[1:16:42] sees Paul for what he was cold hard
[1:16:45] religious spirit not only did he not
[1:16:48] have fruit as I said but he he had he
[1:16:50] was full of hatred
[1:16:55] and God didn't cut the tree
[1:16:57] down God had patience with him then
[1:17:00] Jesus comes and changes that man
[1:17:03] completely
[1:17:06] around Paul led many many people to
[1:17:10] Christ Paul at the end of his ministry
[1:17:13] he's he he comes to trial and he appeals
[1:17:16] to Caesar now he's in Chains and he's
[1:17:18] going to go to Rome and this King named
[1:17:22] agria comes to him and he's like oh yeah
[1:17:25] I've always wanted to meet this
[1:17:27] guy Agrippa was was a weirdo married his
[1:17:32] sister yeah not not not a not a good guy
[1:17:36] at all and he's like oh yeah I want to
[1:17:38] see Paul so here's Paul a grippa comes
[1:17:40] in and Paul's in these chains and and
[1:17:42] King Agrippa and then the the the other
[1:17:44] guy named fesus they're talking to Paul
[1:17:46] and Paul's like listen agria look at the
[1:17:49] attitude that Paul had he cared about
[1:17:52] this man no matter how weird he was he
[1:17:55] cared about his soul and Paul looked at
[1:17:57] him and Paul saw
[1:18:01] potential he said AG
[1:18:04] grippa he gives him his
[1:18:06] testimony he says I was on my way and
[1:18:09] yeah I was a bad guy and I did all these
[1:18:11] things wrong and I was wanting to kill
[1:18:12] all these Christians and then God got a
[1:18:14] hold of me
[1:18:16] Agrippa and he says Agrippa do you don't
[1:18:20] you believe the
[1:18:22] prophets this man Jesus fulfilled what
[1:18:25] the prophet said and then he says this
[1:18:28] Paul says Agrippa he says I know you
[1:18:34] believe he laid it before him it wasn't
[1:18:39] successful with a a grippa but look how
[1:18:43] Paul saw even he even saw potential in
[1:18:47] that
[1:18:48] man and everyone that he talked to
[1:18:51] Philip when he when he was later on and
[1:18:54] in the book of Acts Philip is out and
[1:18:56] he's preaching a a Revival in this city
[1:19:00] the Lord leads him out into the into the
[1:19:02] field into the desert and he sees
[1:19:04] potential in this this man this that
[1:19:07] this Ethiopian important person he's in
[1:19:09] his Chariot and he's reading probably
[1:19:11] out loud reading Isaiah and here comes
[1:19:13] Philip he
[1:19:15] saw
[1:19:16] potential in this man this unic and he
[1:19:21] says what are you
[1:19:22] reading comes gets up on his chair
[1:19:24] Chariot and starts talking with him and
[1:19:26] leads that man to the Lord
[1:19:30] Jesus he saw
[1:19:32] potential as I said if you want to do
[1:19:36] Revival if you want to have a Revival
[1:19:39] you need to do Revival
[1:19:42] things don't judge one another always
[1:19:46] put someone put them in the highest the
[1:19:50] highest of your
[1:19:51] thoughts and say you know what I see
[1:19:54] potential
[1:19:57] all of us brother
[1:19:59] Manny how what if somebody wouldn't have
[1:20:01] show saw any potential in
[1:20:03] me Manny wrote this text me this morning
[1:20:08] sent me a picture of the food that he
[1:20:09] was
[1:20:11] making and
[1:20:13] there he said God's
[1:20:15] good he gave me the desires of my
[1:20:19] heart gave me a new family including the
[1:20:22] congregation
[1:20:25] you guys are my brothers and sisters in
[1:20:29] Christ you guys show me all kinds of mad
[1:20:31] love and
[1:20:33] respect I don't know what that means but
[1:20:35] it's
[1:20:38] good says I appreciate every one of you
[1:20:40] in this
[1:20:41] congregation God saw potential brother
[1:20:44] man where were you many years
[1:20:47] ago yeah he says I was Paul I was full
[1:20:50] of cactus there wasn't there wasn't
[1:20:51] anything in me brother lion where were
[1:20:53] you many years ago but God saw potential
[1:20:58] in you he saw potential in me I was the
[1:21:01] one that was more like Paul I was a
[1:21:02] legalistic one that there was no
[1:21:04] potential in at all in there and God saw
[1:21:07] something in
[1:21:09] me I see it in every one of
[1:21:13] us that if we would just dig around and
[1:21:16] we would just take care of one another
[1:21:18] if we would just help one another what
[1:21:19] could God do if you want a Revival do
[1:21:21] Revival
[1:21:22] things Reach Out spend some of your
[1:21:27] time invest in this because great things
[1:21:32] let me tell you great things are going
[1:21:33] to happen they are prophesied to happen
[1:21:35] they will happen one day I want to be a
[1:21:37] part of it I'm not going to just take my
[1:21:41] own fig
[1:21:42] leaves and not bear
[1:21:46] fruit all leaves and no fruit so
[1:21:51] often bear that fruit but to do it it
[1:21:56] takes an
[1:21:58] effort you have to help someone else you
[1:22:02] have to pray for someone else and when
[1:22:04] you do that you will see that the fruits
[1:22:07] are starting to Bear In
[1:22:09] You Jesus said he said don't go
[1:22:12] outwardly don't go outside and pray on
[1:22:15] the corner or come to the platform and
[1:22:17] pray this big long prayer and it sounds
[1:22:20] so good he said don't do that he says if
[1:22:23] you do that you've already got your
[1:22:24] reward was like oh yeah pray is really
[1:22:26] nice that's nice I love to hear him
[1:22:28] pray he said don't do that he said go
[1:22:31] into your
[1:22:32] closet get down on your
[1:22:35] knees and pray in secret and then he
[1:22:38] says if you pray in secret then the Lord
[1:22:41] will reward you
[1:22:43] openly what does that mean doesn't mean
[1:22:46] you'll be
[1:22:48] exalted it doesn't mean that if if I'm
[1:22:50] in my closet praying for you brother Joe
[1:22:54] that that that God's going to answer my
[1:22:57] prayer and then I'm going to say oh I
[1:22:59] prayed wasn't
[1:23:02] me God's going to answer my prayer for
[1:23:05] you God's going to answer the burden
[1:23:08] that I have on my heart for that person
[1:23:11] then in openly God is
[1:23:14] glorified because that person
[1:23:17] changed think about all these people
[1:23:19] that I've mentioned it's because someone
[1:23:21] believed in them Daniel you can come for
[1:23:26] closing in the worship
[1:23:29] team let me read this verse again my
[1:23:33] little
[1:23:36] children these things I write unto you
[1:23:39] that you sin not and if any man sin we
[1:23:42] have an advocate with the father Jesus
[1:23:44] Christ the
[1:23:45] righteous and he is the perpetuation for
[1:23:48] our sins and not for ours only but also
[1:23:52] but for the sins of the whole world
[1:23:58] that's the heart of
[1:24:00] Christ he will never stop fighting for
[1:24:04] you you have someone that does not want
[1:24:08] to see you
[1:24:09] fail if you don't truly know Christ if
[1:24:12] you're not truly bearing fruit in your
[1:24:15] life
[1:24:17] remember Jesus never stops fighting he
[1:24:20] is that one that's out in that field and
[1:24:22] he's tending to that tree he's he's
[1:24:24] saying I'm I'm going to I'm going to get
[1:24:26] it okay and then the water's going to
[1:24:28] come in and then the fruit is going to
[1:24:29] bear and then that tree is going to be
[1:24:31] saved that's why Jesus was saying
[1:24:34] it he is that
[1:24:37] advocate he is the vine dresser he is
[1:24:40] the one that's taking care of the
[1:24:42] field and there's the father that
[1:24:44] pronounced judgment upon the upon the
[1:24:46] Earth and there's Jesus saying
[1:24:50] father give me some
[1:24:52] time I'll take care of
[1:24:55] it's going to bear fruit it's going to
[1:24:58] change he will never he will never stop
[1:25:02] fighting for you you may turn from
[1:25:04] him but he will always be there and he
[1:25:08] is the one that won't sometimes we give
[1:25:10] up on people but Jesus Christ will never
[1:25:13] give up on you he will never stop
[1:25:16] fighting for you he will always be that
[1:25:19] one that just just stays the wrath of
[1:25:21] God just a little bit further I know
[1:25:23] there Sinners I know they're not bearing
[1:25:25] fruit I know that they have all these
[1:25:27] problems
[1:25:28] but I'll fertilize them I'll Water them
[1:25:32] I'll prune them I'll take care of
[1:25:36] them and if we have Christ's
[1:25:39] Spirit then we will do the same for our
[1:25:42] children we'll do the same for our
[1:25:43] husbands we'll do the same for our wives
[1:25:45] we'll do the same for our cousins we'll
[1:25:47] do the same for our
[1:25:49] neighbors and that's where our Revival
[1:25:53] starts it's starts when we do that for
[1:25:55] each
[1:25:56] other and these disciples they they've
[1:25:58] done it I listed many
[1:26:03] examples and if it Wells up in you like
[1:26:06] God well they're not
[1:26:07] Believers these people that that the
[1:26:10] pastor was talking about I don't want to
[1:26:11] be like
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:13] them that's why there's no
[1:26:17] Revival that's why there's no that's why
[1:26:21] there's no converts that's why there's
[1:26:22] no fruit
[1:26:24] the fruits of the
[1:26:26] spirit it's in Galatians let me find
[1:26:30] it thanks
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:36] bro brother Manny God bless you you know
[1:26:40] you've
[1:26:42] been
[1:26:44] such your testimony has been such a
[1:26:47] blessing Galatians
[1:26:50] 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:26:55] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:26:58] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:27:02] against such there is no
[1:27:05] law all of these things all of these
[1:27:08] fruits of the spirit they are not for
[1:27:11] you if you are bearing them the fig tree
[1:27:14] doesn't bear fruit for
[1:27:16] itself it Bears it for other
[1:27:19] people that's where we miss
[1:27:22] it but Christians brothers and sisters
[1:27:24] start tending those wells around those
[1:27:26] those trees because you don't know if
[1:27:28] they'll bear fruit or not let God sort
[1:27:30] it out Paul went to Agrippa he didn't
[1:27:33] know if Agrippa was going to be
[1:27:34] converted or not Paul the prophet the
[1:27:37] Apostle the greatest of them all he
[1:27:39] didn't know and here he is before this
[1:27:41] King and this King was a sinner and
[1:27:43] everything and he says oh Agrippa he
[1:27:45] says I would like I just wish you would
[1:27:46] be like me agria said I I you almost
[1:27:49] convinced me Paul and he says oh if you
[1:27:51] just were like me
[1:27:54] you would have such Joy such peace you
[1:27:57] would have all these things except
[1:27:59] Agrippa I just wish that you didn't have
[1:28:01] these chains that I have
[1:28:03] on he
[1:28:05] cared he saw he he saw that there could
[1:28:09] be hope in this man this evil
[1:28:12] man and that's the way we should look at
[1:28:15] everyone never look down on anyone
[1:28:17] always always cultivate that crop and
[1:28:20] then you watch figs will start to grow
[1:28:24] they'll do
[1:28:26] it that I can promise because the Bible
[1:28:29] says
[1:28:30] it
