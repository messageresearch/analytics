thing that topped it off for me seeing all the people here and and many that haven't been for a long time coming and joining us in many new faces that we've seen that haven't been introduced to what we know got introduced this Sunday and the Highlight for me was after the service I walked back and I was shaking people's hands and his brother Ed pointed over in the corner in the back far corner where you all are and there's a young man has head down he had hair that covered covered his his head his hair is about down to here his hands in his face is dressed in white and he had chains around his neck the Lord was dealing with him I walked over there [Music] everyone pretty much had left the congregation [Music] I said God bless you brother he said he says I don't know what to say he said what you were saying about a life being Resurrected he said I want that to be to my life he said what you said about us being the cause of everything that's happened in our lives and and how most of the things that we bring on ourselves he says he says brother that was me and he said he says I just he says I want to get back to who I was so we prayed and it turns out that for the Arne Peterson and he was the man was here and maybe doing something he shouldn't been doing and brother Arnie approached him and he said that man approached me and he said you know what he said you know what he did he said he was kind to me and he said something in me said you need to go to that church and he said here I am he says I don't even know why I'm here he says I've never been to this church he said I don't know anything about this church so we came and brother Arnie came and and we came up to the Altar and we all knelt down and prayed here for a while and brother Arnie stayed with him and prayed for I don't know how long after service but I believe something happened in the young man's life I look forward to seeing him again he had the same name as the homeless man that I've been witnessing to named Alex and they they're both their names are Alex [Music] I am thankful thankful that we do have a little Lighthouse here people can come in they'll feel free to come in and you're always welcome brother there in the back you're welcome to come anytime you want to my friend all the way in the back in the black raise your hand God bless you my brother you're welcome to come and you sister back here you're also welcome raise your hand if you could be good welcome my sister [Music] we want you to come we want you to Come As You Are all of us are sinners all of us have done things wrong but our lord Jesus was sent to this Earth for Sinners he himself said the sick he himself said those that are well don't need a physician it is those that are sick that need help and I have been sick so many times in my life and I thank God that he has always been there for me and he has never given up on me Stephanie and I went over the past few days we wanted to get get away and get some rest so we went up the White Mountains and stayed up there we visited the camp that we're going to be having in the middle of September really excited about it it's it's a beautiful place it's in it's way up in the pine trees there's elk and deer up there and and I believe that the Lord is going to bless us while we're up there it's a life for the congregation to start praying about the what we should have at the camp and how we should have the camp go we have a few prayer requests also please pray for sister Mercy's zamaran one of her legs is swelling sister Rachel Guerra writes please pray for my daughter Abby and the children they're sick you know she also says thank you for praying brother David we've been praying for you my brother brother David Murray pray that the Lord's had his hand on you or sorry to hear about your sister but sometimes we don't know the Lord's will we don't know why things happen but one thing that we do know that everything happens for a purpose and that God had a purpose in it we just pray our biggest prayer is we want to find that purpose also sister Amelia has a prayer request says here I'm asking for prayers for myself I've been suffering all week long with allergies or cold a lot of coughing and congestion I claim my healing in Jesus name amen I like that Stephanie and I on the way over here we stopped by this Spanish church that's on Miracle Mile and Oracle there and the pastor I asked the congregation also pray for that church they want to build a building and they've got a sweet little congregation the pastor's name is Luis so let's let's also pray for that group serving the lord doing their best to bring Sinners to the Lord Jesus to serve him the best that they know how amen can we stand as we pray Brother David fontenere come on up and and lead us in prayer [Music] we're going to hear in the sermon I believe I can guess that we're going to hear in our sermon tonight about a couple believers that healed the sick man at the gate called Beautiful in Acts chapter 3. let me tell you the god that healed that man is still alive today and he is still a Healer he's still a miracle working God let's bow our heads though David if you would come [Music] as Brother David is coming if you'd have a request upon your heart and ask that you raise your hand in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] Jesus we're thankful once again Lord to be able to gather like this in this this building Lord we can feel your presence moving up and down the aisles Lord we just ask that you would forgive us where we've fallen short so many times when we look around us Lord we'll stumble by the things that we see and unfortunately Lord when people look at my life I'm afraid that they'll they would stumble as well but when we all look up Lord and we Look to You Lord that's our that's our only hope is so help us Lord Jesus to keep our eyes on you and and May our Focus be the end of the the road Lord the light at the end of the tunnel as it were we just ask that you would remember each one here you know the the details of every age you know the secrets of each heart you know the the trials and tribulations that each one are going through some things only you know Lord there's there's no words that sometimes we can lean on each other but you're the only one who really understands each one and I believe you do Lord you are here in in a human body and you you went through a lot of the things that we went through you you had a heartache yourself and and sickness and pain and and I believe you remember all those things Lord and we with confidence we bow before you and we we lift these needs before you Lord knowing that you're the great physician you're the great Creator and all of our confidence is in you Lord We Lay these needs before your great Throne we just ask that you would bless the remainder of this service leading and guide each one here draw us up Real Close to You Lord in Jesus Christ and we pray amen foreign I'm grateful that this place dedicated to the Lord Jesus is somewhere that can always welcome a visitor a weary traveler and I'm grateful that I can walk in here as Brother David as he prayed and maybe thinking upon the things that we all do wrong and I'm thankful that we can come together worship and we can set aside all of our differences and set aside all of our sins and know them they're under the blood of our Lord Jesus one more time and trusting Jesus [Music] me only just believe when you go on his name [Music] good evening I I know it's not the first of the month but I'm here anyway before musicians leave the instruments they like us to sing a song that's reflected in our lesson this evening on Acts 3 and the song is part of the reason why we know that he hears our prayers because Jesus is alive [Music] Jesus is alive [Music] Jesus is Alive sin and death must go they are conquered [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus is alive Jesus is Alive [Music] Vegas tonight we're going to continue the series at our Pastor Daniel began on March 22nd on the book of Acts it's my privilege to share with you this evening let's welcome the Lord once again into our midst that he might anoint whatever is said to his Divine purposes let's just go before the Lord One More Time Lord Jesus it is such a privilege that we have that we can come before you as brothers and sisters as siblings in Christ part of your family Lord we pray that you would be here with us Lord I I oftentimes wonder why am I standing here there are others that are so much more competent and so much more accomplished and so much more Lord I don't know the words but but nonetheless Lord here I am so Lord I pray that you would help me to be yielded to you Lord that that nothing would be said that would hurt or harm anyone or cause anyone to stumble but that questions might be answered Lord that needs might be met Lord that you might speak to us and help us realize it that this book is not something of history of of nearly 2 000 years ago but its guidance and direction today because it's written by the Living God and it's written for your living people we commit ourselves now into you forgive us of our sin where we fall short and help us Lord to please you the remainder this evening for we commit ourselves to you in Jesus precious name amen while we're standing please turn in your Bibles to our topic verses they are found in the Gospel According to Luke chapter 22. when you found that place in your Bible say Amen raise your hand let me know that you found it amen okay we've got one one oh another one I see another one okay well we'll uh we'll continue on then Luke chapter 22 verses 31 and 32 the the setting is the Last Supper Jesus has announced his betrayal the disciples have uh proclaimed their loyalty to him and the Lord Jesus said Simon Simon he's he's talking to Peter there are there's another disciple also named Simon but he's talking to Peter behold he says look here Peter pay attention listen Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat well how do you sift wheat you don't sift weed you crush it you grind it to powder then you sift it but Peter I've prayed for you and my prayer was this Peter first that thy faith fail not and second when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren and we'll see him do exactly that in our lesson this evening please be seated even though Jesus warning was directed to Peter I doubt Satan gave up or that he doesn't want to sift every believer the same way that he wanted to sift Peter and Jesus prayer contains good advice don't let our faith fail and strengthen each other by this Jesus said will all men know that you're my disciples when thou art converted that's a strange word in Modern English it implies a change in nature or position or function a transformation if you will but Peter was certainly transformed not long after Jesus said these words in Luke 22. we'll learn another meaning of the word translated as converted as we proceed this evening brother Daniel shared with us the last time he spoke on this series from Acts 2 that the day of Pentecost was the day that Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit he was converted and what happened the church was born Pentecost that's when he preached that sermon there's something I want to share with you about the feast days of the Lord commanded the descendants of Israel to observe bear with me that I think it helps bring context to the events and the first few chapters of Acts as you may be aware last Wednesday was Passover and we are now this evening at the conclusion of the Feast of unleavened bread which is a seven day observance immediately following Passover I'm going to go into just a little bit of detail about these feasts I was going to go into a lot of detail but as I mentioned it to Heather her eyes kind of glazed over so I took that as a signal I'd better be brief so in addition to the weekly Sabbath these are the feast days that are all listed in Leviticus chapter 23. there are seven of them the first three Passover unleavened bread and first fruits occur in this spring and notice I've listed the Hebrew month Nissan 14 Nissan 15 to 20. their months don't overlap or align exactly with ours that's why sometimes Easter can vary from late March to late April even though it always falls in a certain time in the month of Nissan the next Festival is weeks would we call Pentecost it's in the late spring in the fall there are three more trumpets atonement or Yom Kippur and Tabernacles as you can see in this slide five of these occur on specified dates of the month which means they may fall on any day of the week think of Independence Day July 4th in our holidays it can fall on any day of the week some years people get unhappy if it's on a Sunday because they don't get Monday off of work right but two of the feasts I've marked them with question marks they don't fall on a specified date but rather on a specific day of the week like our Thanksgiving holiday which is always on the fourth Thursday of November regardless of the date which are those two Feasts first fruits where a Sheaf of grain is waived before the people this is the start of the spring barley Harvest and it's a unique celebration this is the only feast day where a Sheaf of grain is waved the first fruits occurs on the day following the Sabbath that occurs during the Feast of unleavened bread which starts the day after Passover everybody got that so skipping the math and the logic it may fall as early as the 16th of Nisan to as late as the 22nd of Nissan the date can vary but the day of the week does not it always falls on a Sunday always first fruits from our Christian Perspective we celebrate as Easter Paul tells us Jesus was the first fruits of the Resurrection First Corinthians 15 he says but now is Christ risen from the dead as we just sang Jesus is Alive and become the first fruits of them that slept Jesus rose on the Feast of first fruits he was the wave chief on that day of days and that same day after he arose we're told many of the Dead appeared in Jerusalem Matthew 27 tells us the graves were opened many bodies of the Saints which slept and came out of the grace after his resurrection and went into the holy city appeared unto many again Jesus was the first the first fruits and we worship on Sunday to honor that resurrection and renew the promise we have as a result the other Feast that has an unspecified date but always falls on the same day of the week as first fruits as weeks what we call Pentecost it's tied directly it's anchored to firstfruits 50 days later I find this Beyond interesting it was pre-planned in detail by the Lord that the only two feasts in the list of Feasts that are not specified by date but by the day of the week are the two that have the most meaning to us as Christians Easter and Pentecost and the specified day of the week is not the Sabbath as you'd expect but the first day of the week Sunday Jesus rose on first fruits what we call Easter Sunday the day the priests and the temple were waving the Sheaf the resurrected Jesus was on display bringing this back to the book of Acts now seven weeks and one day after that first year Easter Peter preached a sermon to those gathered outside the upper room that morning marking the Feast of Weeks Pentecost Sunday which by the way is the only other feast that includes waving and that's what happened on that first Pentecost in this case two loaves made of fine flower but Satan hadn't sifted the wheat Christ had and the bread of life was now on display through his disciples Luke reports to us at about three thousand Souls were added that very day to the ranks of Believers in Christ in direct response to Peter's anointed words tonight we explore a bit about what happened next there'll be a lot of reading this evening if I go too fast please signal me slow down bro I tend to get carried away at times likewise if I speak too softly signal me to speak up if I speak too loudly let me know that I'm hurting your ears this section of Acts is so applicable to us and our lives and our experiences right here in Tucson today so turn in your Bibles please to Acts chapter 3. we'll start at verse 1. we'll be reading the first 34 verses I'm expecting somebody to raise their hand and say wait a minute brother Lyle there are only 26 verses in Acts 3. I can count the first 31 verses of chapter 4 are part of the same Narrative of what happened over the two days that this part of the account covers chapters in the Bible are often not at logical breaks many times you lose a threat or the meaning if you stop reading at the end of a chapter I'm sure you've noticed that in your quiet times your devotions at home well we'll stop after the first eight verses of chapter four setting the stage for the next installment of Acts chapter 4 which I believe brother Daniel will be teaching from perhaps next Wednesday that's not a prophecy or a prediction that's just an opinion everyone have Acts 3 located okay here we go now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour that's about three in the afternoon it's the time of the afternoon sacrifice it's the moment Jesus yielded up his Spirit on Good Friday we'll stop here for just a moment we know about the temple and its centrality to Jewish worship Peter and John were practitioners of Judaism were living in Jerusalem it made sense that they'd go to the temple and pray at the normal hour for such prayer Jesus never told his followers to stop being Jewish during the week leading up to his death he was in the temple every day but we need to ask ourselves we know about this Peter and John they're Central characters in our chapter this evening what are their backgrounds their Natures their temperaments were they super Saints or were they just like us Jesus had a number of followers that at one point early in his ministry he whittled the number of men down of his disciples his students to 12 men and there was also an unknown number of women after all we're told in Luke 8 that many women of some means provided Financial Resources for his team and ministered to them three of them were named Mary Magdalene Joanna Susanna well regarding the 12 the gospels record the calling of six the brothers Peter and Andrew the brothers James and John and the not Brothers Philip and Matthew we don't know when or how or in what order he called the others here's the only disciple if it were told was married we also know that he along with his brother Andrew and another pair of brothers James and John were fishermen on the lake we call the Sea of Galilee they weren't Scholars of the Tanakh or anything like that Peter was a man of faith who trusted Jesus remember Jesus prayed that thy faith fail not recall when he saw Jesus walking on the water in the dark of night during a storm he asked to walk with Jesus he got out of the boat and he did so for a moment when his faith faltered he cried out and Jesus reached out pulled him up they entered the boat together the storm ceased all the disciples in the boat declared that Jesus was the son of God that's related in Matthew 14. two chapters later and a little while later in Matthew 16 they're walking along the road and Jesus asked the disciples who they thought he was Peter replied Thou Art the Christ that's a Greek word it's the anointed you're the Messiah son of the Living God and what was Jesus reply blessed art thou Simon barjona gods revealed this to you I'm going to call you Peter a rock blessed blessed art thou Simon but a few days later in just a few verses later Jesus reveals what he's going to go through at Jerusalem and what does Peter do thou art the Christ the son of the Living God he takes Jesus aside and says no don't talk like that that's not going to happen no he's he's you can keep scolding Christ and what does Jesus say to the one that he had said just a few verses early was blessed get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense to me Peter says he will stick by Jesus no matter what at the Last Supper and some tens of minutes later he runs away along with all the others who'd said the same thing and goes on Peter does to denounce Jesus claiming he didn't even know him denouncing him with a curse and this was after trying to defend him from arrest by taking a sword and taking the ear off of one of the people that was out there to arrest Jesus Peter was volatile he was loyal but at times not so dependable sounds a bit like brother Lyle sounds like many of us I suspect well so much for Peter what about John the other character in this narrative we think of him as the disciple of love he calls himself the disciple whom Jesus loved in his own Gospel account but he was pretty political he sought position he sought influence and he was pretty judgmental recall it the Last Supper Peter asked John to ask Jesus to identify the betrayer right John 13 but a few days before that John and his brother James along with her mother privately tried to get Jesus to promise that these two brothers would sit next to Jesus one on the right one on the left when he sat on the throne of his kingdom the power seats the positions of influence Matthew 20 mark 10. when they found others casting out devils in Jesus name not trying to they were accomplishing it John reported to Jesus that he and the others forbade them since they weren't part of their group they followed not us they'd go to a different Church we're right they're wrong Jesus was pretty unhappy with this report and basically told them to get over it draw their circle of Fellowship a little larger he that's not against us is for us Mark 9 Luke 9. 9 how often do we put God in a box restrict him to only working within what we call the message or how we interpret it later when a Samaritan Village rejected Jesus and the disciples John and his brother James wanted to call down fire from heaven and consume them Jesus told them you don't know what Spirit you're of Luke 9. like Peter John was an imperfect human not a super saint yet in spite of these shortcomings Peter and John were both part of what we might think of as the inner circle of disciples Peter James and John were the only ones Jesus allowed to accompany him into the home of Jairus to raise his daughter from death Mark 5 and Luke 8. at the Transfiguration experience only Peter James and John were allowed to accompany Jesus mark 9. Matthew 17. after Jesus death all the disciples went into hiding including John they were afraid can you see yourself and any of these attributes of Peter or John or any of the other followers with that brief background We Now find Acts chapter 3 opening with Peter and John going to the temple to pray we've learned that 50 days after Jesus resurrection as the wave chief on Easter on the day of Pentecost they were filled with the Holy Spirit had they changed Jesus said the purpose of the infilling of the Holy Spirit the power that they would have was so his followers would have power to be his Witnesses spreading the good news without fear and on that Pentecost they became the wave loaves with that background in context the stage is set for our lesson tonight Acts 3 starting again at verse 1. now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man we are never told his name lame from his mother's womb this was a birth defect it wasn't a disease it wasn't the result of an injury this man had never walked he was carried well that means that this lameness was in both legs if it was one leg that was Lane he could have used a cane or a crutch and gotten around but he was carried and who carried him we don't know family friends did they do it begrudgingly or cheerfully out of love as an act of giving to the Lord a good deed with the Jewish people call them mitzvah we don't know but he was laid daily six days a week a year after year at the Gate of the temple not the Gate of the city but of the temple inside the city it's on Mount Moriah so not wherever they lived they had to go uphill they had to carry this guy up hill six days a week after week month after month year after year decade after decade it was the gate called Beautiful to ask alms to beg Gifts of money a Mitzvah ask arms of them that entered into the temple now the people going into the temple you assume are religious people they're observant so they're traditionally compelled to do good deeds and maybe they're a good deed that day is going to be to help this guy out well we don't know where the gate called Beautiful is or was because the only reference to a gate called Beautiful is in the New Testament it's not in any of the histories or writings of Josephus Etc so we don't know but these images are of something called the the double gate it's here and and here this is modern times of course this may have been the gate called Beautiful no one knows for sure but archaeological excavation through this double gate enters a passage with ornate domes and so forth that led up to the temple area as you can see the place where it would have exited is now occupied by the el-oxo mosque was in the news this last week this passage certainly was part of a beautiful gate if not the beautiful gate so this guy was laying there by the gate and and the lame man seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asking alms hey buddy can you spare me a dime he asked a gift of money of everyone that passed by nothing out of the ordinary and Peter being shown by the holy spirit that this man had the faith to be healed fastening his eyes upon him with John with John how can two walk together unless they be agreed said look on us don't look down don't cast your eyes aside Don't Look Away you're about to receive a lot more than you anticipate from a couple of poor men like us and the lame man gave heed he listened he responded to them do Peter and John why expecting to receive something of them expecting to receive money he wasn't looking for healing then after Peter and John had the man's complete and focused attention Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None I imagined his eyes kind of dropped at that point but such as I have was he possessive or selfish or protective of it was he willing to give it away such as I have I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up it's amazing and walk impossible this man had never watched he he did he have good enough balance to do that we don't know I'd like to share a little testimony with you about a time why I think this is such a miracle there was a time a few years ago where I had a uh an incident and uh I wound up tearing uh something in my leg so my from my hip to my toe turned black it was just one gigantic bruise and I wound up in the hospital and I wound up with you know what they call a shotgun pulmonary embolism basically my chest was moving but I wasn't really able to breathe um anyway what I'm getting to was after we went through some medical procedures and so forth that uh I I wound up being con I had to stay in bed for a while for a few weeks actually and I could get up you know and hop or hobble or something but I couldn't put any weight on that leg well if I put my hands around my thigh you can see there's a big gap between my thumbs well at that point my thumbs overlapped pretty pretty completely so I had lost a huge amount of muscle mass in my leg when it was okay for me to get up and walk that was great news except I couldn't because I had no strength in my leg so I had been lame in one leg for just a matter of a few weeks and I couldn't walk I used a cane and I managed to hobble around but but that's just a few weeks it turns out that this guy was 40 years old so for 40 years he'd been carried for 40 years he'd been unable to walk if in a few weeks I couldn't walk what about this guy after all this time well Peter No Doubt when he was saying this to the man he remembered Jesus words from Matthew 5 The Sermon on the Mount give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow thee turn not thou away such as I have I give to you and Peter took the lame man by the right hand oh now this guy's got to make a decision do I accept this offered hand attempt to stand risk damage pain and injury or do I refuse and just shake my money cup Adam he made his decision and lifted him up and immediately the lame man's feet and ankle bones received strength feet is plural so both legs are lame notice a reference to his feet and ankle bones not withered limbs this may have been severely deformed feet and ankles like clubbed feet it's a birth defect we know that I'm going to just show you an image of of club feet that's a little disturbing so if you've got people with you that shouldn't see something disturbing I'll just have it up there for a moment but you can't walk that you just can't do it okay these are examples of club foot and this is likely I think what the lame man had at the temple I've taken the picture away many times you might recall brother green told us the first time he saw a brother Branham in Texas in 1950 there was a small child with clubbed feet brother Branham asked everyone to Bow their heads and he took this little toddler this little very young child and he prayed for the little boy and then he dropped him to the floor he dropped him to the floor brother green says there was a collective gasp from the audience well they didn't have their head spout and that included brother Greene at that time he was a 16 year old youth Brother game reports he saw the club feed on the toddler and witnessed the miraculous healing by the time the child reached the floor feet were normal and he was standing many times in the gospel accounts Jesus Took the petitioner by the hand after proclaiming healing Peter's mother-in-law Jairus daughter and so forth Peter's doing what he saw Jesus do and Peter took the lame man by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately the lame man speed and ankle bones received strength and heed the stricken man leaping up leaping up this is the only time in the New Testament where that phrase is used leaping up this is unique to it and walked and entered with them Peter helping stabilize him perhaps on one side John on the other we can infer that from from what follows into the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people in the temple area at that time saw him walking and praising God and they the people in the temple area knew that this man leaping and walking and praising God was he which sat for arms at the beautiful gate of the Temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him now I realized as I read some of those verses that I said some things that weren't written I I said Peter knowing by the holy spirit that the man had faith I said the man had to make a decision to be lifted up those are statements brother Branham made about these particular verses and Conference a time of decision acts of the Holy Spirit and other messages we have and as the no longer lame man which was healed help Peter and John he helped them perhaps he needed a little support he'd never walked before he had strength but did he have balance anybody here ever ride a bicycle when you learn how to ride a bicycle did anybody ever fall over maybe of the day that the training wheels came off and then you had to turn and you discovered that you lean you don't do that well this guy was 40 years old and he'd never walked what was his balance like don't know all the people Shrugged and got back to praying reciting the Amada no no they soldered over in mild curiosity no they scolded the man for disturbing their worship and carrying on those who saw this evidence of a miracle ran together unto them them demand Peter John and the porch that is called Solomon's it's within the the outer Court as near as I've been able to determine just after they had passed the beautiful gate and climbed the steps up to the temple Plaza greatly wondering what is this and this porch or Portico was at a higher elevation in the gate so they're no longer lame man had to climb these steps with Peter and John here again you can see this was the the double gate that saw the picture of earlier this is a model that's at the Israel Museum of what people somebody some artists thinks that Jerusalem looked like at the time of the second temple gates are down here this Plaza and then you're gonna have to go upstairs somehow to get up to this level here you can see a slightly different those steps were down over here and somewhere around here is what's called Solomon's porch so he was walking he was leaping he was climbing and when Peter saw it when Peter saw the crowd rushing towards his small group he answered he responded by addressing the people there was a large group of people so we had to raise his voice a bit ye men of Israel so not speaking to the Gentiles not speaking to the women's Court not addressing them as judeans or other provincial residents but as descendants of Jacob ye men of Israel why Marvel ye at this why look he's so earnestly on us as though by our own power or Holiness we made this man to walk Jewish tradition is that you keep the rules you worship sacrifices and and some may achieve a higher level of spirituality but sodak as we would say in Hebrew and perhaps you could work miracles or render healings or cast out demons it had to do with your level of spiritual achievement so Peter first explains this isn't the case even though it's the expectation of the crowd they're training their tradition established over many centuries Peter continues the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob in other words the god of our forefathers hath glorified his son Jesus this is already a radical Concept in Judaism it's common among those that worship the emperor Caesar or earlier times in worship Pharaoh is a God calling a human being God's son is radical in Judaism and that God The God Who said I will not share my glory with another Peter says he has glorified in other words this Jesus is God in flesh that's what he's telling the crowd glorified his son Jesus whom ye delivered up ye remember is a plural it's a collective you delivered up and denied him I think that was hard for Peter to say because just 50 days plus some unknown amount of time before that he denied the Lord many times the very night before the crucifixion but Peter was now converted as Jesus had prayed and we read on our opening verses delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when pilate was determined to let him go all four gospel accounts attest to this but he collectively and doing so had to also be individually you denied the Holy One and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you Peter's reminding them of that awful day of their recent past and the complicity of the crowd and condemning Jesus to crucifixion and releasing Barabbas you know that some of these people in this large crowd had to have been part of that crowd too and killed the Prince of Life and now comes the the Zinger whom God hath raised from the dead it's not just something we're repeating because regard s Resurrection whereof we John and myself are witnesses are witnesses that was that was a pretty severe punishment for bearing false witness for lying about things in those days but he's standing up and saying we Are Witnesses of this and his name Jesus through faith in his name not some magic incantation like another Simon thought when he attempted to buy the power to use the Holy Spirit to cast out Devils as we'll read in a later chapter of Acts but through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see you know this man's a new stranger isn't somebody that we brought in as part of our traveling troop to to you know cheat you beat you out of some money or something right but he's been at this gate he's been brought here carried here for decades no doubt Jesus saw him lying there too the time for his healing as a witness of the Resurrection had not yet come yea the faith which is by him by who Jesus hath given him who this formerly lame man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all this isn't done in a corner they weren't the only ones on the steps at the gate called Beautiful it was The Hour of Prayer there was a crowd moving up at the same time it wasn't just these guys in the corner now they're going up and saying hey guess what this was not done in a corner and for us tonight notice this guy wasn't hanging around the pool of Bethesda waiting for the waters to be agitated he wasn't looking for healing he wasn't expecting healing but Peter had extended his faith to the man when you are converted strengthen your brethren as we read in our opening scripture that act operated the gift of healing in recent times a couple of weeks ago a few weeks ago Heather and I were were visiting our brother Nathaniel Dougal at in prison near El Paso Texas he has seen God do Miracles and healings of men who claim to not have faith because Nathanael told them he had faith if they would allow him to pray for them same principle book of Acts happening in a prison outside of El Paso and now brethren Peter's identifying himself with them he's not pushing them out not enemies but brothers and now Brethren I walk that through ignorance what is one of those it's not like how many watts of Illumination in a light bulb this is this is I realize I know this is King James English right that through ignorance she did it as did also your rulers Peter's extending grace to the crowd Peter's experienced Grace he's extending grace to the crowd even to the high priests and others responsible for the execution of Jesus Jesus after all said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing Peter goes on but those things the rejection horrible method of death of Jesus which God beforehand showed by the mouth of All His prophets first after verse after verse in the Old Testament talks in this Genesis 3 15. Isaiah 15 6 all of Isaiah chapter 53 Zechariah 12 10 13 7 Daniel Psalms 22 69 uh he says that all His prophets that Christ the Messiah the anointed one should suffer Jesus hath fulfilled okay Peter says so much for background seeing this man here and hearing what I just said you should be feeling unimaginable guilt so here's what you need to do he's not going to leave them hanging he says repent ye therefore what is repent it's an attitude sorrow and be converted that your sins may be blotted out this is an action converted the word means to turn around to turn back to go again it's the meaning of the Greek word translated convert that I alluded to earlier this evening that your sins may be blotted out smeared over removed obliterated Isaiah 44 22 for example says I have blotted out as a thick Cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me be converted for I have redeemed thee may be blotted out when the times of refreshing recovery Revival shall come from the presence of the Lord and he the Lord as the father shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you on the day of Pentecost probably every day since then whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things in Divine Healing 1954 brother Branham says this means new Heavens new Earth new beginning with no ending which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets since the world began it gives a couple of examples Moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye here in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you that's Deuteronomy 18 15. and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people that's Hosea 9 17. my God will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him and they shall be Wanderers among the Nations yea and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days he says you're the children of the prophets the The Descendants the relatives and of the Covenant what what Covenant which Covenant the Covenant which God made with our fathers saying unto Abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed that's Genesis 22 18 and I see to all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice that was spoken to Abraham right after God rescued Isaac from being sacrificed on Mount Moriah the very place of the temple where Peter is making this declaration unto you first God having raised up his son Jesus sent him to bless you and turning away every one of you from his iniquities Peter is now preaching his heart to the people the disciples were told to spread the good news beginning at Jerusalem thus Peter says unto you first he's in the middle of his sermon maybe he and John are just getting warmed up and as they Peter and John spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them not by chance this was a deliberate action of the authorities they heard something going on and they went to check it out here's why they came being grieved for a couple of reasons first that they Peter and John taught the people who are these guys what gives them the authority to do this they're not our guys and second preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead now this Doctrine Resurrection from the dead or even just the concept of an afterlife the Sadducees denied this was heresy to them and recall the temple was run by which group the Sadducees not the Pharisees not the essenes the Sadducees have made a path with the Maccabees after the revolt against the seleucid rule or Antiochus the fourth epiphanies back around 160 BC nearly two centuries earlier for the Sadducees Temple worship was the Cornerstone of the Jewish religion everything revolved around the temple the sacrifices it was temple-centric no Temple no Judaism for the Pharisees well they they took the written word in the oral tradition and and their religion was portable if you didn't have a temple they tried to interpret things in the context of the culture and the times that they found themselves so they wanted the temple there but if the temple was gone that wasn't the end of it all as far as they were concerned for the Sadducees it was and they were the ones that ran the temple so while the Pharisees survived the destruction of the temple some 40 years later the Sadducees didn't they disappeared shortly after that as an influential sect and they these authorities laid hands on them now it wasn't to extend a blessing it wasn't to pray for them it was to seize them it was to arrest them and they put them and hold now we'll we'll discover when we get deeper into chapter four I say we not when I lead you deeper into chapter four but somebody else is going to do that that wasn't just Peter and John but the lame man was also put in hold well you'll see that in the context of what happens so they're in jail until the next day why it's evening so it says here that uh for it was now even tied so these events transpire over a period of one or two hours because remember it was about three in the afternoon as they approached the gate then the miracle took place then they went up to the porch then the crowds came then they started to address them then they got arrested they got dragged off to jail so it took a couple of hours however however how be it in spite of the intimidating actions of the authorities witnessing the seizure and arrest of Peter and John and the healed man many of them many of the crowd gathered at Solomon's porch which heard the word Peter and John believed they accepted their teaching and instruction and exhortation and the shadow were maybe more accurately in light of the undeniable miracle and the number of men was about five thousand so this sermon after a miracle of healing this interrupted sermon was more effective than the sermon on the day of Pentecost which added three thousand so now they're up to nearly ten thousand people in a pretty short time we can only speculate that other disciples and followers of Jesus stepped up and helped these new converts they didn't just stand around with their hands on their pockets it came to pass on the morrow next day that their rulers the the Jewish rulers and elders and scribes and anus the high priest note again this was a political office after the Revolt of The Maccabees the the aaronic priesthood the descendants of Aaron to be priests had disappeared centuries before so this was now a political thing and the Sadducees were the office holders ran the temple they were the ones that would be threatened by this kind of thing so Annas the high priest and kfs that these two Anderson kaifa said just weeks earlier presided over Jesus trial and John not the disciple we don't know who this John is and Alexander And as many as we're the Kindred of the high priests were gathered together at Jerusalem a little bit of nepotism going on here and this list was written for the for the benefit of the generation at the time of the writing of the ACT some of these names don't mean a lot to us now but it meant something these were people that they knew of then at that time and when they the ruling Council had set them Peter and John and as we'll see the healed man in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost remember what Jesus says about the reason for the infilling of the spirit to be Witnesses of him starting in where Jerusalem where is this Council and Jerusalem he said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel we're going to stop we set the stage now hopefully it's a bit of a cliffhanger and you'll come back next Wednesday and at this time if the musicians would please come back to their instruments and while they're coming are reminded of a song written by our brother Fred Barker many years ago it's it's the life behind the name is the name of the song I suspect some of you here may have been present in the old Tabernacle on South Stone the day brother green invited brother Fred to come and share his testimony and his experience with with brother Branham at that time brother Fred lived in California he wasn't what we would call a follower of the message he was associated with a Full Gospel businessman and was a very solid Christian man but it was during that service while he was sharing the brother Barker received a revelation of what brother branham's Ministry was all about shortly after that he and his family moved to Tucson were part of the fellowship here until his passing so I wonder if if we could sing this together I hope you know it I hope you can drown me out and don't have to listen to me it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart it was God who devised a plan that in all things as a man [Music] it's the life behind the names that makes the demons tremble this will fly behind the name that makes the proud heart humble this was God who divides the plan okay it's the life that makes the demons trampled it's right behind the name that makes life let's stand one more time [Music] as a man so we can get give us a life behind the name brother Lyle God bless you my brother thank you so much I think brother Lyle gave us a little hint about how that story ends with that song you know I really appreciate

the name it's the life behind the name that makes the Devils it's the life behind the name [Music] again give us the life behind the name [Music] you feel good do you love the book of Acts it is it is just precious it is is something that just means so much to us because as our brother Lyle said these are common people but they had the very same Spirit of Christ that Jesus Christ himself had and they walked in that spirit and they did these Miracles I I appreciate it brother Lyle pointing pulling that out in the scripture about brother about John and how have John he wanted to be one of those one of those elevated ones and and even brother Lyle didn't have he could have gone much deeper brother brother John he even knew the high priest we see that that in the in the gospels that John had connections to some of to some of the the uh the Sadducees it would be and he was able to go in to the areas that other people wouldn't wouldn't be able to go into so I really appreciate that I love learning something but allow and I certainly did tonight brother Jeremy would you come and close my friend one more time it's the life behind the name it's the life behind the name that makes the
