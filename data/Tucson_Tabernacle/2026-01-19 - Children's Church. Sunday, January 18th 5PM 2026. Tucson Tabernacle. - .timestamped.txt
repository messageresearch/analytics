[0:33] you come along?
[0:37] Some of you might have recognized that

[0:42] radio program. They start out with that
[0:44] song. And if you don't know what
[0:45] Children's Bible Hour is, you can ask my

[2:13] and Christ is Lord indeed.
[2:17] Let's sing the first verse again. So,
[2:19] we're going to stand up for Jesus. And
[2:21] when it says soldiers of the cross,
[2:23] we're going to march. And when it says
[2:25] lift the banner, we're going to raise
[2:26] our hands. Okay, boys and children and
[2:29] girls and everyone. Amen. Stand up.
[2:33] Stand up for Jesus.
[2:36] Ye soldiers of the cross,

[2:44] It must not suffer loss.
[2:48] From victory unto victory
[2:52] his army shall he lead
[2:56] till every foe is vanquished
[3:00] and Christ is Lord indeed.
[3:04] Stand up. Stand up for Jesus.
[3:08] Ye soldiers of the cross.
[3:12] If high is royal banner,
[3:16] it must not suffer loss.
[3:20] From victory unto victory,
[3:24] his army shall he lead
[3:28] till every foe is vanquished
[3:32] and Christ is Lord indeed.
[3:37] Amen. Brother Dingwall, would you come
[3:38] just open service with a word of prayer?
[3:41] I don't believe we have any prayer
[3:42] requests this evening. Let's just
[3:44] remember the needs from this morning.
[3:46] Remember service this evening. Amen.
[4:01] God bless you. It's nice to be here. You
[4:04] know, I see all these little kids down.
[4:06] I was principal of a school for a number
[4:07] of years. One of my favorite things to
[4:10] do was go into the kindergarten room,
[4:11] not only because my daughter taught it,
[4:13] but it's always smiling, always happy.
[4:15] Sometimes I'd be in a staff meeting.
[4:16] It'd be people getting a little bit
[4:18] grumpy and you know how adults can be.
[4:20] So I'd look at my watch and say, "Oh
[4:22] man, I'm late for a meeting." And I'd
[4:24] head straight to the kindergarten room
[4:25] because they were all Mr. Dingo. You
[4:27] know, so you know, except you be as
[4:30] little children. That's what that's what
[4:32] that's what the Bible says. The first do
[4:35] is all right if I visit a little bit.
[4:36] the the the first uh devotion I did with
[4:38] the little kids, I was a little nervous,
[4:40] you know, because I was used to being
[4:42] among more adult thing, you know, and
[4:45] and so I went into the Sunday school
[4:47] into the into the kindergarten class to
[4:49] do a devotion once and I I realized I'm
[4:51] a lot taller than they are. Can you
[4:54] imagine if Goliath was your Sunday was
[4:56] your was your preacher? You know, you
[4:57] might be a little intimidated. So, I
[4:59] would take a chair and just sit down
[5:01] here like this. sit down in the chair.
[5:03] And I said to them the first time, I
[5:05] said, "Okay, now just pull all your
[5:06] chairs up and we're going to have a
[5:07] talk. Pretend it's your grandpa. We're
[5:09] going to have a grandpa talk." And when
[5:10] I did that, they pulled their chairs
[5:12] right up till their knees were touching
[5:14] my knees. And then, okay, I'll just back
[5:18] a little child. The innocence of a
[5:20] little child, right?
[5:22] &gt;&gt; So, God, God bless you. Let's pray
[5:23] together.
[5:25] Father, we just bow in your presence
[5:26] today. We just want to thank you for
[5:29] your goodness and your grace toward us,
[5:30] Lord. And we just ask Father that uh the
[5:34] service this evening would not only
[5:35] speak to the little children but the big
[5:37] children, the adults, the seniors. Have
[5:40] your way this evening Lord Jesus. We
[5:42] thank you for your grace in Jesus name.
[5:44] Amen.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; All right, you may be seated this
[5:51] evening.
[5:56] Let's sing the song. He's got the whole

[9:37] this evening, but we'll have brother
[9:38] Daniel come. Let's sing Yes, Jesus loves
[9:41] me. Says Lurel, one of Lurel's favorite
[9:43] songs. Yes,
[9:46] Jesus
[9:48] loves me.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[9:53] Jesus
[9:54] loves me.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[9:59] Jesus
[10:01] loves me.
[10:03] The Bible
[10:06] tells me so. One more time.
[10:10] Oh yes,
[10:12] Jesus
[10:14] loves me.
[10:17] Yes,
[10:19] Jesus loves me.
[10:23] Yes,
[10:25] Jesus
[10:26] loves me.
[10:29] The Bible
[10:31] tells
[10:41] This is great.
[10:48] Elijah said, "Oh, come on.
[10:55] The Lord's good to us.
[10:57] He's good to us that he he gives us our
[10:59] elders for wisdom and he gives us our
[11:04] youth for enthusiasm.
[11:06] I'm I'm excited to announce a veteran
[11:10] preacher that we have here in the Tucson
[11:13] Tabernacle. He has done this one time
[11:15] before and he did a great job. That is
[11:19] our young brother Elijah. You come up
[11:22] here, brother Elijah Murray.
[11:28] God bless you my friend.
[11:41] Lord, we love you and everyone else
[11:44] loves you.
[11:46] And whenever someone doubts you, but you
[11:50] love them more than doubt.
[11:54] And Whenever they hate you, you do love
[11:57] them more than the doubt.
[11:59] Everything what they do to you, you just
[12:02] love them more than the doubt. And we
[12:06] loved you, Lord. We really do.
[12:09] And I know everybody in this church
[12:11] loves you very much. So would you keep
[12:14] everybody safe
[12:16] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; If you have your Can you please turn to
[12:25] Psalms 23?
[12:54] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[12:57] want. And what I like about that
[12:59] scripture is
[13:01] we don't want to.
[13:05] We don't want because he provides. He
[13:08] provides for us. And the second is, he
[13:14] maketh me lie down in green pastures. He
[13:17] leadeth me beside the still waters. And
[13:20] the still waters are cleansing our
[13:23] souls.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; We're being renewed. We're our bodies,
[13:28] our souls, they're getting better as the
[13:30] second
[13:36] he he
[13:41] restore my soul. He leadeth me in the
[13:46] paths of righteousness for his sake's
[13:48] name
[13:50] name's sake.
[13:53] Ye thought I walk through the valley of
[13:58] the shadow of death. I will fear no
[14:01] evil.
[14:03] We will feel no evil. And one time I was
[14:06] scared in my bed because I don't like
[14:08] sleeping in the dark. So I prayed to God
[14:16] for thou
[14:17] are with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they
[14:21] comfort me.
[14:30] Thy
[14:32] prepares a table full
[14:36] before me and the presence of my
[14:40] enemies.
[14:43] Thou anointest my head with oil.
[14:48] My cup ruth and ruin and runth over.
[14:55] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[14:58] me all the days of my life. And I will
[15:02] dwell in the Lord in the house of the
[15:05] Lord forever.
[15:08] And I would like to say this, it was on
[15:12] the my Bible um bookmark that
[15:18] my dad gave me and it's really cool. So
[15:24] it's really short so like
[15:28] for the word of God is alive and
[15:31] powerful.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:12.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:18] stand here with me for a minute.
[16:21] You did a wonderful job. You were
[16:23] blessing that
[16:29] that psalm has been a strength to to
[16:31] many people for the past 3,000 years.
[16:34] and it was a strength to us and what you
[16:37] said to us and I love the way that you
[16:39] brought it right into your own life. A
[16:42] very very good job
[16:46] and if I had some experience I would
[16:48] have turned my microphone on.
[16:55] Praise the Lord. Elijah did a wonderful
[16:57] job. Let me let me share a little
[16:59] testimony about our former speaker is
[17:03] brother his parents brother Paul and
[17:06] sister Andreanna shared a testimony with
[17:08] me uh about a month
[17:13] almost exactly one month ago
[17:16] and they said that a prophecy
[17:19] was given over Elijah
[17:22] that he would be a boy preacher by the
[17:26] time he was eight years old. Am I right?
[17:29] If that's right, raise your hand with
[17:30] the poll.
[17:32] How old are you, Elijah?
[17:35] He's eight years old.
[17:39] All right. Now, next we have our brother
[17:42] Kenneth Peterson. Brother Kenneth is a
[17:46] young man that has always helped out
[17:47] here at the church. I asked him if he
[17:50] would be willing to give us a few words
[17:53] of encouragement. I asked him a few
[17:56] weeks ago and he was quick to answer
[17:59] yes. Elijah was quick to answer no when
[18:02] I first asked him but persistent but
[18:06] persistence paid off and the Lord's
[18:08] blessed us with with brother Elijah and
[18:10] his ministry. And now we have young
[18:13] Kenneth. And Kenneth is has
[18:19] a sermon with the title of I will let
[18:22] you, brother Kenneth, say your title and
[18:24] then also open your sermon up in prayer.
[18:26] God bless you.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; I might not want to pray.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; I might mess up. Come on.
[18:45] Good evening. Thank you, brother Daniel.
[18:52] The the
[18:56] title of my sermon,
[19:00] the Bible means everything or nothing.
[19:06] Key scripture Matthew
[19:09] 13:16
[19:10] But
[19:12] blessed are
[19:15] you
[19:18] for
[19:20] you
[19:24] your eyes
[19:27] they see and your ears ears here.
[19:46] The Bible
[19:57] doesn't mean anything to you unless
[19:59] you're a Christian. Bible doesn't really
[20:01] mean anything to you unless you're a
[20:03] Christian.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Samuel 1 135 and six.
[20:16] Wait for them to get it up.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; I never wait for them.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Well, this time I will.
[20:32] 1 Samuel 13:5.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Tam, you're awfully slow back
[20:36] there.
[20:46] Verse five. And the people,
[20:49] Philistines, I mean,
[20:52] gathered themselves
[20:56] together to fight with Israel,
[21:05] 30,000
[21:07] chariots,
[21:10] and 6,000
[21:12] horsemen.
[21:16] And people
[21:20] as the
[21:24] sand
[21:29] which is on the
[21:34] sea shore and be
[21:39] multitude
[21:41] and they came up
[21:45] and
[21:47] pitched in McMash
[21:54] Eastward from
[21:56] Bea Beth Aan. I used to call that Beth
[21:59] Ava.
[22:04] Ava, if you're here, you're going to
[22:06] about to be embarrassed. I always
[22:08] whenever I thought of it or I heard it
[22:12] because I listened to stuff at from the
[22:14] Bible at night, I thought it sounded
[22:17] like Ava,
[22:20] &gt;&gt; which is Lydia's best friend.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; She couldn't last a month without her.
[22:27] Verse
[22:36] six.
[22:38] When the men of Israel
[22:44] said
[22:47] saw
[22:48] that they were in
[22:58] and a straight and a
[23:03] straight for the people were
[23:10] distressed.
[23:12] Then
[23:13] the people hid in
[23:20] hiding
[23:23] themselves
[23:26] in in
[23:32] caves
[23:35] and in thickle thicket
[23:40] and in
[23:44] rocks and in
[23:50] high places
[23:54] and pits
[23:57] and
[23:59] oh that is
[24:03] in the pits.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. So now Now, what I want you to do
[24:11] is so now you've read the scripture,
[24:14] okay? And we know that
[24:18] so we know now
[24:20] that the people of Israel, they're in a
[24:23] they're scared
[24:25] and they're hiding and things are really
[24:28] bad. All right? So, what you've just
[24:31] read now,
[24:34] I'm gonna I'll teach you a trick. Now go
[24:35] off of your notes and I want you to tell
[24:39] the story of what happens with Jonathan
[24:43] and who his helper was. Okay? I want you
[24:46] to just tell the story without your
[24:47] notes because you've told me the story
[24:49] before.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; And I'll flip them upside down.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; But I might see through them.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; So I've listened to it several times. I
[25:02] can almost actually memorize it.
[25:05] Dad smiling back there.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; So
[25:12] I am
[25:18] &gt;&gt; My wife does it to me. It's
[25:22] &gt;&gt; I also make kids laugh pretty hard.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; So what So what happened? So everybody's
[25:28] afraid and then then what happens? Who
[25:32] who who steps on? Who is the champion?
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Jonathan and his armor bearer.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, tell the story.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; So, one day
[25:43] upon a day, Jonathan and his armor bear
[25:48] went to the Philistines. And how they
[25:52] knew
[25:53] to get there was there was a sharp rock
[25:57] on one side and then a sharp rock on
[26:00] another side.
[26:03] One was pushing northward
[26:05] against Gibia
[26:08] and then the other one was pushing
[26:10] southwards against Mcmash.
[26:18] And they went passage and they
[26:21] discovered themselves to the Philistines
[26:24] and they said,
[26:27] well, Jonathan said unto his armor
[26:30] bearer,
[26:33] um,
[26:35] if they say, "Behold
[26:40] Terry until we come down
[26:44] to you, we will stand still in our place
[26:47] and not go up unto them. But if they
[26:49] say, "Come up unto us," then we shall
[26:53] go.
[26:54] And they discovered themselves
[26:57] unto the Philistines,
[26:59] and they
[27:01] and the Philistines answered and said,
[27:03] "Come up unto us." And they went up, and
[27:07] they pretty much defeated them.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; And then afterwards, do you want me to
[27:14] tell the story about like
[27:15] &gt;&gt; what happened? Did everybody get it? Did
[27:17] everybody still run away or did all did
[27:20] all of the Philistines did they get mad
[27:23] and attack the the Israelites or did the
[27:25] Israelites get courage and what what
[27:28] happened after that? Oh, there also was
[27:31] an earthquake which
[27:34] &gt;&gt; added to the confusion and the
[27:37] Philistines
[27:40] started fighting each other and then
[27:46] and then
[27:48] &gt;&gt; so what did the what did the Jews do
[27:50] then?
[27:53] Well, the ones that were with the
[27:55] Philistines that went with them up into
[27:58] the camp, they went to turn with the
[28:02] Israelites that were with Saul and
[28:04] Jonathan.
[28:07] And when the people who had hid heard
[28:11] about this, they also followed hard in
[28:13] the battle too. And the Philistines ran
[28:18] away. Do you want me to tell the story
[28:20] about like the honey and all that and
[28:22] the oath.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Uh, not not yet. I want you I want you
[28:25] to tell tell So what happened to the
[28:28] battle
[28:29] &gt;&gt; then?
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Who won the battle?
[28:32] &gt;&gt; The Israelites.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; The Israelites.
[28:35] And they won it. Why?
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Because it was kind of like a surprise
[28:40] attack.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And because Jonathan
[28:44] and his armor bearer Did they have
[28:47] courage?
[28:49] Why did they have courage? How did they
[28:51] know to have courage?
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Because God was with them.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because God was with them. Right.
[28:58] So, let me ask you,
[29:00] when you come against something terrible
[29:05] like Jonathan and his armor bearer did,
[29:10] if God is with you,
[29:13] what do you do? Do you have courage or
[29:16] do you run away?
[29:18] I should have courage, but sometimes I
[29:21] run away.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He's an honest preacher.
[29:26] Praise God. Amen. Very, very good story.
[29:30] That's one of my favorite stories in the
[29:31] whole Bible. Very, very good job.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; You want me to finish my notes or no?
[29:37] Last time I read it, Last time I read it
[29:39] in the car, I got a headache. I did
[29:46] &gt;&gt; about a page and a half long.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Let's let's do this. Let's let's finish
[29:53] with
[29:54] finish your notes right there.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; So, if you're not are
[30:02] a Christian, the Bible will mean
[30:06] everything to you. But if you are not a
[30:12] Christian, the Bible will be like a
[30:17] fairy tale to you.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tell me, a fairy tale is just a
[30:25] story that's not true.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when you read this story about
[30:30] Jonathan and his armor bearer and how
[30:33] the the host of the the the um
[30:37] Israelites, they were afraid and the
[30:40] Philistines were shouting and and the
[30:43] Philistines were were thinking that they
[30:45] were going to win. So do you think that
[30:49] that story is a fairy tale or do you
[30:52] think it's true?
[30:53] &gt;&gt; No.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Is it true?
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. So we can read that story and then
[30:59] we can apply it to our lives, right? So
[31:02] tell me
[31:05] and uh one of you all Elijah come on up
[31:08] here
[31:11] and you stand right next to Kenneth
[31:13] there.
[31:15] So tell me
[31:20] &gt;&gt; this story gives you courage.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, when do you need courage to
[31:25] fight for the Lord? Kenneth, I'll ask
[31:27] you first.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; That's a hard question.
[31:34] When we're in temptation,
[31:37] well, we're being tempted like Jesus
[31:40] was.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; And then you can overcome that
[31:44] temptation, right?
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Elijah, how about you?
[31:49] The question.
[31:51] The question is, you take courage from
[31:54] the Bible. When do you have to have
[31:56] courage?
[31:58] &gt;&gt; When?
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Well, when I would have to have courage.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; I don't know. But
[32:09] &gt;&gt; do you ever get scared?
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Do you need courage when you're scared?
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; So then you can go back to the story
[32:14] that Kenneth told
[32:17] about how these two men defeated 20 men
[32:21] up on top of the mountain.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; It was 20 men.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; I think it was
[32:27] &gt;&gt; 20 Philistines, 20 soldiers.
[32:30] Did they do a good job?
[32:37] &gt;&gt; All right, Brother Jordan, uh can you
[32:39] Where's Brother Jordan? Can can you lead
[32:41] uh lead us in one song? And I want all
[32:43] the kids to come up here and uh let's
[32:46] let's gather around here like Brother
[32:48] Kim said.
[32:50] Brother Kim, you said grand. There you
[32:52] are. Grandpa time. I am now a grandpa.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; So we can have grandpa time together. So
[32:58] come on up here. Everybody come up here
[33:01] and let me take this.
[33:08] Can you get that name of Jesus? In the
[33:12] name of Jesus, demons will have to flee.
[33:20] In the name of Jesus. In the name of
[33:24] Jesus.
[33:25] Amen
[33:27] to flee
[33:31] when we come in the name of Jesus. Tell
[33:37] me who can stand before
[33:42] the precious name of Jesus. We have the
[33:48] victory.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; We did last time. Everybody sit down
[33:57] right around here
[33:59] and I'm going to tell a story. Okay?
[34:03] I'm going to tell a story about a young
[34:05] man
[34:06] and I'm going to read the Bible to you
[34:10] and then I'm going to ask you some
[34:11] questions. Okay.
[34:15] Yes.
[34:16] So,
[34:18] so tell me this.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Ah, I made a mistake.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; All right. So, I'm going to talk about
[34:39] I'm going to talk I'm going to talk
[34:40] about a young preacher. And you know
[34:42] what? I bet you this young preacher
[34:43] liked candy, too.
[34:45] All right.
[34:47] What was my subject this morning?
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Give me some five right there. The
[34:57] sermon on the mount. And what did I talk
[35:00] about this morning that was so important
[35:03] for us all to do?
[35:06] We all have to do it. It's the most
[35:09] important thing in our life.
[35:12] What' you say? Right? Pray. Praying is
[35:16] the most important thing. So there was
[35:19] this man, a great man who you know his
[35:21] name,
[35:23] his name is Paul.
[35:26] Paul believed Jesus.
[35:29] And Paul
[35:31] was teaching a young man
[35:35] how to minister and how to lead a
[35:38] church. Can you think of what this young
[35:40] man's name is?
[35:43] Are you serious? Good job, Timothy. Give
[35:47] Give Caitlyn a hand for getting Timothy.
[35:52] So Paul
[35:54] was teaching this young man and he just
[35:56] loved this young man Timothy so much.
[35:59] And Timothy
[36:02] had a very special mother and he had a
[36:06] very special grandmother. His mother's
[36:09] name was Ununice and his grandmother's
[36:13] name was Lois.
[36:15] And Paul saw that this young man Timothy
[36:20] was so good in the scriptures and he he
[36:22] knew how to pray so well because he had
[36:24] been taught right at home by his mom.
[36:29] So do you see how important it is for
[36:33] us? You know when our parents when they
[36:35] teach us about the Bible when they pray
[36:37] with us it's very very important. All
[36:41] right. So let me let me they do what?
[36:45] They love you very much. Yes they do.
[36:47] Your parents love you more than anyone
[36:49] else in the world does except for the
[36:51] Lord Jesus. Except for the Lord God.
[36:53] Yes.
[36:55] Second Timothy reads like this. And he's
[36:59] writing a letter. This is the apostle
[37:02] Paul writing a letter to Timothy. Okay.
[37:07] So when we open up our Bible,
[37:12] we go
[37:14] towards towards the back. These are
[37:16] letters. These are letters that people
[37:19] saved and people translated them into
[37:22] English for us so that we can read them.
[37:25] So the apostle Paul is writing to this
[37:28] young man who he wants to be a preacher
[37:31] and he's giving him advice. Okay.
[37:35] The apostle Paul says this. He says, "I
[37:37] thank God
[37:39] whom I serve with a pure conscience as
[37:41] my forefathers did
[37:44] as without ceasing I remember you in my
[37:46] prayers night and day." Remember I
[37:48] talked about prayer this morning and the
[37:51] Apostle Paul is saying that I remember
[37:54] you in prayer. So Abraham that this
[37:58] would be like me praying for you and
[38:02] saying Lord I pray that Abraham does
[38:04] well in school. I pray that he's
[38:06] healthy. I pray that he's doing well.
[38:07] Okay. So the Apostle Paul says this that
[38:10] I remember you in my prayers day and
[38:11] night and I greatly desire to see you.
[38:13] So he's writing a letter and he can't he
[38:15] can't see him.
[38:17] They didn't have facetime back there
[38:19] back then. So, he's writing this letter
[38:21] and he says, "I want to come see you."
[38:23] And he says, "I'm mindful of your tears
[38:25] that I that I may be filled with joy
[38:27] when I call to remembrance the genuine
[38:30] faith that is in you
[38:32] which dwelt first." Now, listen close.
[38:36] Which dwelt first in your grandmother
[38:41] Lois
[38:43] and your mother Ununice.
[38:46] and I am persuaded is in you also.
[38:49] Therefore, I remind you to stir up the
[38:51] gift that is in you through the laying
[38:53] on of my hands. So, what does that mean?
[38:57] The stirring up of the gift that is in
[39:00] you.
[39:03] No, there's a gift that's already inside
[39:05] of you, Caitlyn. Yeah.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; You awaken it. Yes. You're stirring up.
[39:12] What were you gonna say?
[39:16] So let me tell you all of you kids kids
[39:20] here each of you has a gift that is
[39:23] inside of you.
[39:26] All right. And you see how good Kenneth
[39:29] your memory is and how you can quote the
[39:31] Bible so well and and how you you like
[39:34] to hear the Bible and then Elijah and
[39:37] how well you can you can give your love
[39:41] you can project it to the people and how
[39:43] good you are at that and Asher just I
[39:46] can see that you're you're such a
[39:48] compassionate boy and as you grow up you
[39:53] that compassion will go out to other
[39:55] people
[39:56] and all of you has a gift. And here Paul
[39:59] is saying that I want to stir up that
[40:02] gift that's with that's within you. And
[40:04] that's what we're trying to do in
[40:05] church. That's what we try to do in
[40:06] Sunday school. That's what we try to do
[40:08] in children's church. We're trying to
[40:11] stir up the gift that all of you have.
[40:14] And every one of us has a different
[40:16] gift.
[40:17] Okay? Means that that you have something
[40:20] that God wants to use. Therefore, I
[40:22] remind you
[40:24] to stir up the gift of God which is in
[40:27] you through the laying on of my hands.
[40:29] For God has not given us a spirit of
[40:32] fear, but of power. This is really
[40:36] important. Remember Kenneth's story.
[40:40] The armor bearer and Jonathan were not
[40:43] afraid
[40:44] when they when they went up there. And
[40:48] then your psalm that you read, yay that
[40:50] though I walk through the valley of the
[40:51] shadow of death, I will fear. I will not
[40:54] fear. I will fear no evil for God is
[40:56] with me. Okay. So, how can we be afraid
[41:00] if God's with us?
[41:02] And it says here, for God has not given
[41:06] us a a spirit of fear, but of power and
[41:10] of love and of a sound mind.
[41:13] All right. So, who here
[41:17] has gotten scared at night?
[41:22] You have. You've gotten a You've gotten
[41:24] afraid when when you're in the dark,
[41:25] maybe by yourself.
[41:31] Yeah. Asher says Asher says he's been
[41:34] afraid because there's a big storm. Why
[41:36] were you afraid?
[41:41] You got really terrified one time and
[41:43] for no reason. Kenneth, why? Why were
[41:45] you
[42:03] so you get feelings in your body when
[42:05] you're scared at night? Abraham, do you
[42:06] ever get scared?
[42:12] Get scared of thunder. Chloe.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; So, I've shared it before, but I kind of
[42:23] want to share it again. So, one time we
[42:25] were in the car and it was thundering. I
[42:27] was really kind of really scared. Then
[42:30] my favorite song, Take
[42:33] It All Back, came on and I was not even
[42:36] scared at all.
[42:38] You know, I I have the same testimony.
[42:40] When I was your age, I used to get
[42:41] really afraid of the dark. And when the
[42:44] when the lights go out, I'd always want
[42:46] to go in and jump in bed with mom and
[42:47] dad. But I was I was so afraid.
[42:52] But look what Paul is telling Timothy
[42:55] here. For God has not given us a a
[42:58] spirit of fear. So when you're afraid,
[43:01] remember that doesn't come from God.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; That comes from the enemy. And you
[43:06] should never be afraid. We You know why
[43:10] we should never be afraid? Because of
[43:11] what you said, Elijah, in your in your
[43:15] sermon that I will fear. I will not fear
[43:19] because you are with me. Amen. I will
[43:22] fear no evil because you because thou
[43:24] art with me. But for God has not given
[43:27] us a spirit of fear, but of power and of
[43:31] love and of a sound mind.
[43:34] All right. So we should never fear. We
[43:37] should never be afraid. Okay. So I read
[43:40] the scriptures. Now
[43:53] &gt;&gt; nope.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; All right.
[43:57] So
[43:59] who wrote
[44:00] the book of second Timothy?
[44:03] You got to raise your hand. Who wrote
[44:04] the book of second Timothy?
[44:07] That's a very good good answer, but
[44:09] nope. Asher.
[44:11] Who wrote the book of second Timothy?
[44:13] Who wrote the letter to Timothy? I was
[44:14] just talking about.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Good job. Paul. Paul wrote that. All
[44:23] right. Now, next question.
[44:26] What was Timothy's mom's name? You got
[44:30] to raise your hand. Chloe
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Ununice. Good job. What was Timothy's
[44:36] grandma's name?
[44:39] Lois. Right.
[44:42] So then
[44:45] let's see what's another question. Um
[44:51] he said that I stirred up the gift that
[44:55] is within you by
[44:59] laying on of hands. Right. Who hasn't
[45:01] got candy yet?
[45:03] Okay.
[45:05] Then then uh Paul says, "For God has not
[45:10] given us the spirit of
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Asher." Asher, right? God has not given
[45:18] us the spirit of of fear, but of what?
[45:23] Love and
[45:25] &gt;&gt; peace.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Peace is good. How about
[45:31] &gt;&gt; power? Right. Right. Did everybody get
[45:33] candy? All right. Good job, everybody.
[45:35] You can go back to your seats.
[45:41] Brother Jordan, where are you? I'm going
[45:44] to give it back to you.
[45:53] Should I ask the audience if they want
[45:56] candy if they can answer questions too?
[46:00] You know, when Jesus would preach or
[46:03] when when the elders would preach back
[46:06] in in the biblical days, they would sit
[46:09] down like this and then everybody would
[46:12] would gather around and then they would
[46:14] teach.
[46:16] So, I enjoy sitting I enjoy sitting
[46:18] down.
[46:24] Do you want to tell them what we're
[46:24] going to do, brother Daniel, or you want
[46:26] me to? You want to tell them what we're
[46:28] gonna do on the next song here?
[46:35] &gt;&gt; All right, kids.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Let me come come on back up here.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Genesis, come up.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Well, this is all the older kids are
[46:43] going to want this, too. And we'll have
[46:44] to pick some adults.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Come on up.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; You know, I think that we could we could
[46:48] we could bring Laurel up, too, if she
[46:50] wants.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; She'll like this.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan. Even Daniel Jr. can help.
[46:56] Come on, Laurel.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, does anybody know the song
[47:01] This Little Light of Mine?
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Who knows it?
[47:06] &gt;&gt; How does it go?
[47:07] &gt;&gt; This little light of mine.

[47:22] have to do we let our lights shine in
[47:24] the daytime? We let our lives shine in

[53:16] &gt;&gt; Good.
[53:18] You know friends, telling that story of
[53:20] Timothy and how Timothy may have been a
[53:24] man maybe Daniel's age and wanting to
[53:27] serve God. And look at why it was so
[53:31] important
[53:33] that the Apostle Paul
[53:36] put his mother, put her name there and
[53:40] her grandmother and how important that
[53:43] home life was on this young man Timothy
[53:47] and what an influence it made on him to
[53:50] where he pastored probably the most
[53:53] advanced church at the time there in
[53:56] Ephesus. So
[53:59] to the parents, the young parents,
[54:02] continue on. Kids doing a great job.
[54:06] Kids like singing. They they like the
[54:09] stories.
[54:12] Elijah and Kenneth did a good job in
[54:15] presenting the word for us. And it's our
[54:19] job to stir up that gift. Whether it be
[54:21] a gift of song, whether it be a gift of
[54:24] ministry, whatever that gift might be,
[54:26] we stir it up within them. And we might
[54:29] use candy to do it, we might use
[54:31] flashlights, we might use stories, but
[54:34] it's imperative that we prepare this
[54:37] next generation for the work to come.
[54:39] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Father, we're
[54:41] grateful, Lord, that you've given us an
[54:44] opportunity,
[54:46] Father, to to present your word to the
[54:49] next generation.
[54:51] And then, Lord, it's so beautiful to see
[54:53] how how they know your word and they're
[54:56] being taught at home.
[54:58] Just Lord, as as it was with Ununice and
[55:02] and her little boy Timothy as he was
[55:04] growing up and she instilled that word
[55:06] into him.
[55:08] And father now we pray that as we move
[55:11] forward
[55:13] in life that Lord that we could stir up
[55:16] the gift that is in these young people
[55:19] not just the young people Lord but the
[55:22] gift of everyone that is in this church
[55:25] father because believe that we all have
[55:27] something to give a gift to give to each
[55:30] other. We thank you. Thank you for
[55:34] brother Jordan, sister Martha,
[55:38] Father, the the gift that's within them
[55:41] that they could stir up these youth and
[55:44] and get them excited about worshiping
[55:46] and excited about your word. Thank you,
[55:47] Lord. Thank you for Brother Kim and his
[55:50] wife visiting us and the visitors that
[55:52] we have here.
[55:54] Lord, we are just grateful. We're
[55:57] grateful that we can call upon the name
[55:59] above all names, the name of Jesus
[56:01] Christ. And Lord, that you would lend
[56:03] your ear down and you would hear us now.
[56:06] Lord, I pray your blessings would rest
[56:07] upon our children.
[56:10] Father, be with them as as they grow up
[56:14] and the teenagers, Lord, be with them
[56:16] and may your hand be upon them and bless
[56:19] them and may they be a light, Father.
[56:21] Not a light of a flashlight, but a light
[56:23] of the gospel shining everywhere they
[56:25] go, whether it be in school or or work
[56:28] or or Father, at the playground,
[56:29] wherever it might be. May they be a
[56:31] light to this dark world. We pray. We
[56:35] love you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; One of the kids. So, we will do it
[56:46] again. The joy of the Lord is my
[56:48] strength and you are all dismissed at
[56:50] this song. I
[56:50] &gt;&gt; I think if we're going to sing this
[56:52] song,
[56:54] um I like to keep the kids coraled.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. and and it's really fun for us to
[57:01] watch. So, all the kids come up here
[57:03] again
[57:05] &gt;&gt; now. No punching, no hitting,
[57:08] &gt;&gt; no biting,
[57:12] &gt;&gt; there we go. We have Laurel. And no, no
[57:14] squashing babies. All right.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; All right, brother Jordan.

[57:22] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[57:27] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is
[57:33] my strength. The joy of the Lord is my
[57:38] strength.
[57:41] He gives me living waters and I thirst
[57:45] no more. He gives me living waters and I
[57:49] thirst no more.
[57:52] He gives me living waters and I thirst
[57:56] no more. The joy of the Lord is my
[58:00] strength.
[58:02] The word of God is nighe even in my
[58:07] mouth. The word of God is n even in thy
[58:12] mouth. The word of God is n even in thy
[58:18] mouth. The joy of the Lord is my
[58:22] strength.
[58:24] He fills my heart with laughter. Aha.
[58:30] He fills my heart with laughter.
[58:35] He fills my heart with laughter.
[58:40] The joy of the Lord is my strength.
[58:44] Verse one. Oh, the joy of the Lord
[58:49] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[58:54] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[58:59] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is
