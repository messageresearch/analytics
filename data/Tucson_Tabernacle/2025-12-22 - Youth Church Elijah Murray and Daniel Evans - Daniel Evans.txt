Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus [music] Christ is alive. So on the screen we have it as is alive. In the book it's is born and I was saying is Lord. All of those are true but we're going to for tonight sing is born. So, let's just sing it again. And as we do that, if all the little children want to come up here to couple the front rows, that would be great. The parents are welcome to come up, too, or to sit in a row or two behind. Kenneth, you want to lead the way? Go ahead. Let's let Kenneth lead the way. Lurel can come up with grandma if she wants. Coming up, Abraham. Liam, you're hiding. They can call come up. Everyone can come up. And if you all the adults want to kind of come up closer too, that might make the parent or the children feel a little more comfortable.

We didn't have any specific written ones in except for the Daniel Junior's headed to Phoenix here in a little bit. So, just pray for traveling mercies for him as he travels up there. I appreciate traveling mercies. Seems like lately we've just been driving and just so many accidents around us and just people not paying attention. We were driving down here asto this morning and a guy was just walking down the middle of the road and he was so in the middle I couldn't decide whether I go around him on the left or the right. So I just kind of went slower and slower and slower until he was 5t from our hood and then he looked up and was like, "Oh, you're you're there." So it's the Lord's gracious and merciful to us. Amen. So that's the only request I have is traveling mercies for brother Daniel Jr. Let's stand this evening. We're going to sing Jesus Loves Me. This I know. And uh Asher's going to come and I'm sorry.

You know, ministries sometimes will have a theme song. Brother Greens was He is Lord. Brother Brandham had only believe. I think Brother Billy Graham had just as I am. And uh Elijah had asked for hosana the other night. So, I thought we would sing that right here as brother Daniel comes. So, we're going to sing that. Hosana. Hosana. Blessed be the rock.

[singing] This one right here is going to work. I'm happy. Wow. This is this an exciting time. Our first youth church and they've done a great job so far. And now I have a little testimony to share before we get started. I was praying this morning. I was getting ready my service early early this morning. I leaned back in my chair and I had asked Elijah if he would minister a little bit for us this coming Sunday night to to the youth. And uh he said no. And he didn't even give it any give it any thought. He was resolute. He said no. And I said, "Okay." I said, "You sure?" And he said, "Yeah." Okay. So that was when was that? What? Was that on Wednesday or maybe last Sunday? I think it was like maybe Wednesday or something. Then this morning, early in the morning, I sitting back in my chair. I said, "You know what? I think I'm going to ask Elijah. Will I really need some help? Because we really need a minister on Sunday night. And I think I'm just gonna ask him, will he will he do it? Will he do it for me?" Because he loves boy. Really loves Pastor Daniel. And uh so I get to church and I I was back in in the back back here and as I was walking this way, Elijah came walking in and didn't even greet me. Greet me. He said, "Pastor, I want to do it." Okay, very good. Because I was going to ask you. I felt like the Lord wanted you to to minister this evening. So, brother, now the next step. Do you want to open in prayer and have the people seated or would you like to have them seated now? What would you like to do? &gt;&gt; They can be seated. Okay, you can be seated. Let's make sure your microphone's working good. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Just talk. &gt;&gt; It sounds like it's working. You need water. There's your water. Feel good. All right. My good friend &gt;&gt; Elijah Murray is going to bring the message for us this. [applause] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads for prayer? Lord, we thank you for everything you've done. Bless the people out there, the people that don't love you. Can you please bless them to to love you, Lord? Lord, we love we love you and you love them. The people that don't love you, you love them so much. You love every creation that you created. It's when you build something and you just love it. you'll keep it forever safe in your heart. Lord, we just ask if you could bless this church, bless everyone in it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; And I was going to say that I hope that you can get a good feeling when I say this. I would want I want to share a message called just one drop. And the scripture that's first up is Luke 16:24. The rich man shouted, "Father Abraham, have some pity. send Lazarus over here to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. I am in anguish and those flame in those flames. And what I like about that scripture is he just it's like just one drop from the finger. he wants like it's just one drop. And the next scripture I would like to share is John 7:38. He that believes in me as the scripture that said out of his belly shall flow rivers. Jesus living water, holy holy spirit. And that's one. And the last scripture is Matthew 11:28. That labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my wait. Take my yoke upon you and [sighs] learn of me for I am mean meek and lonely in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my burden is light light. [applause] Now, all right. I'm going to take your notes. I want you to stand in front of this podium here and I want you to tell all of us how special the Lord Jesus is to you and what he means to you. Okay? stand. &gt;&gt; Well, I would like to say that the Lord is a blessing. He'll always be a blessing to all of you. And I trust him. I believe in him. He's helped me countless times. He's helped my father. He's helped He's helped Pastor Dan. He's helped every single one of you. He's helped my mother a lot. And how special that love is [snorts] is like so much love that we can't we don't compare. &gt;&gt; His love is just outstanding. &gt;&gt; And we love him so much that he loves us so much that he died on that sins for us. &gt;&gt; We should have paid the price, not him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm just saying Jesus loves us so much that he was sacrificed his own life for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. God, [applause] &gt;&gt; that was good. It should have been us that died on that cross, but it was him because he loves us. Amen. Good job. Do you appreciate that little preacher here? [applause] All right, brother Jordan. Let's stand. We'll sing that song again. Yes, Jesus loves me. And then we'll do another moving song. All right. Yes, Jesus loves [singing] me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so.

Yes, Jesus loves me. The [singing] Bible tells me so. He loves you, doesn't he? Amen. Amen. All right. Father Abraham had many sons. You all know this one? &gt;&gt; I know it. &gt;&gt; All right. That's great. I'm going to need help. So let me get to this the perfect we need to [snorts] get to the words here and we'll get started. All right. Father Abraham had many sons had many [music] sons had. Father Abraham and I am one of them and so are you. So let's just praise the Lord right on. Father Abraham had many sons had many sons had.

Hopefully, Brother Daniel's ready. He told me he needed five minutes. Feel like I gave him five minutes, but if we didn't, we can sing another song. All right. I don't see him, so we'll sing one more. What's the song? Someone say a song name. &gt;&gt; Asher, did you say something? &gt;&gt; No. Elijah, what's your Would you have a song?

Praise him. &gt;&gt; Praise him. &gt;&gt; Praise him when the sun goes down. [singing] &gt;&gt; My name this evening is Matthew. I was going to come out as Luke, but we didn't have Luke's outfit. So, this is Matthew. That was supposed to be funny because we don't know the difference in their outfits. So in speaking from the point from the perspective of Matthew what I will be talking about this evening and I would like for the young people to help me. So the way that we used to do this thing in my time is I would take a seat here because I am the one ministering and then all of you would come up here. So, all the young people, come on up here. And I want you up here. Stay there. Yeah. Come on. Everyone under 16. Come on. Come on. No, no, no. What are you facing them for? I'm the important one here. Come on up here and sit. Yeah. So, the way that we did it in Bible time, now you got to face this way, Abraham. The way that we did it in Bible time is you can sit Indian style, you can sit with your feet out or sometimes you can just sit like this. All right? So just relax. So again, my name is Matthew. Not like that. Liam, &gt;&gt; you can be seated. Parents, I'm sorry. Thank you. Abraham, sit up. So, if I am Matthew, tell me what was my job before I met Jesus? You have to raise your hand to give an answer. &gt;&gt; Yes. Fisherman. No. &gt;&gt; Tax collector. &gt;&gt; Tax collector. Yeah. Yeah. So, Matthew, what you didn't know about Matthew in the Bible is he liked candy. And when and when you get a question right, you get a piece of candy. All right. &gt;&gt; So, what I wanted to do is I wanted to talk about the birth of the Lord Jesus. I was a tax collector and Jesus walked by my tax collecting booth one day and guess what he said? Raise your hand. He said, "Oh." &gt;&gt; He said, "Come follow me." And you know what I did? I left my booth and I went and I followed the Lord Jesus. I knew there was something special about him. So I also knew that it was my going to be one day my job to write a book, write a letter about this man, Jesus, because I wanted all the world to know about this man. So I started watching Jesus closely and I was watching how he would do things. And one of the things that that intrigued me was that Jesus was from the lineage from the tribe of who? Raise your hand. from the tribe of Judah, right? He came from the tribe of Judah. And who else is from that tribe of Judah? &gt;&gt; Matthew. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; David. Right. So, David was from this tribe of Judah. So, I like numbers. Okay? And if you'll watch in my book, there are a lot of numbers. And there are a lot of lineage there. So if you look from Abraham down to David, there are a certain number of generations. Does anybody know how many generations there are? No. &gt;&gt; 100? No. &gt;&gt; You're getting closer. No. Now you're getting farther away. &gt;&gt; No. N &gt;&gt; 200. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; 14. &gt;&gt; Oh, look at you, Bianca. How did you know that there were 14 generations? &gt;&gt; I just say it. The last Christmas players. &gt;&gt; Very good. Give Bianca [applause] a hand. That's why we have Christmas plays so we can learn. So there were 14 generations from Abraham to David. And then from David there were a certain number of generations to the Babylonian captivity. Can anybody guess how many generations there were from that, Liam? &gt;&gt; 14, right? Good job, buddy. All right. And then from the Babylonian captivity, I'm going to ask one of you. From the Babylonian captivity to Jesus, guess how many re how many generations there were? &gt;&gt; 14. &gt;&gt; No. Yes. But I asked them, 14, right? 14. Right. There were 14 generations. 14 14 14 generations from Abraham to to David. Do you does anybody know what a generation is? So I from me to my son Daniel is one generation. Okay. So from from brother Paul to Elijah is one generation. Then from brother Paul to his parents is a generation. So every time you have a family like you said is a generation. 14 generations from Abraham to David. 14 generations from David to the Babylonian captivity. Okay, I said Babylonian captivity. Who knows what the Babylonian captivity is? Is he? They did. It was captivity. It was the kingdom that came in and took over Judah. But who was that meanspirited king that did it? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. Right. Very, very good. Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; I read that. &gt;&gt; You read that, too? Huh? &gt;&gt; Well, then you need you need &gt;&gt; Don't eat them right here. This we're in church. We can't eat in church. What? &gt;&gt; I was going to say the captivity that took me and &gt;&gt; Shadrach. &gt;&gt; Shadrach. &gt;&gt; And what was the prophet's name that was in the Babylonian captivity? &gt;&gt; Shadrach. That was his buddies, his friends. &gt;&gt; Daniel. &gt;&gt; Daniel, right? Did you already get candy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're in church. You know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it I'm going to give it to Jenny. All right. [laughter] So, then we have from the Babylonian captivity to Jesus, we have another 14 generations. So, I studied this &gt;&gt; and I Nope. No Indian church. So I studied this generations and I saw all these very very interesting things and I saw that the prophets had prophesied that the Messiah would come from the line of Judah. So that that really intrigued me. So now I'm looking at this man Jesus and I see that he's very special. I see that he is really what I think is the Messiah. But there was a prophecy that we talked about this morning that was very, very interesting to me. And it was a prophecy that I saw that had never been fulfilled. It was a prophecy by this prophet named Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can anybody tell me what the prophecy is he? unto you. &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, left out part of it. You're right. But left out part of this. So Isaiah said that there would be born a baby from a woman that had never been with a man. This would be a a baby born of a virgin. So you know the story behind that. Let me let me tell you the story. So what happened was there was this king of Israel. You're not going to know this. How about any of the adults? Does any do any of the adults, any of the parents or families know what the king's name was that was king when Isaiah gave the prophecy that a virgin would conceive? Does anybody know? &gt;&gt; Nerd Aaron the &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. We got We're asking the parents now. Anybody? You get a piece of candy. Anybody? &gt;&gt; Hezekiah is a good good guess, but no, it wasn't. &gt;&gt; Anybody? Come on. Moms and dads and &gt;&gt; grandpas and grandmas. &gt;&gt; This king. The king's name. &gt;&gt; Let me make sure I'm right. And I am because Matthew's [snorts] always right. &gt;&gt; This king's name was Ahaz. And what had happened with Ahaz the king is he was afraid. Do you know what he was afraid of? &gt;&gt; Daniel. &gt;&gt; No. What was happening to his kingdom? &gt;&gt; It was getting like &gt;&gt; No, not yet. &gt;&gt; Anybody is he? &gt;&gt; He was afraid that someone would take this place. &gt;&gt; Ahaz Ahaz was afraid. Does any How about any of the parents? Do you know what was going on? Why King Ahaz was afraid? &gt;&gt; Okay, now I'm now I'm just gonna I'm gonna tell the story now because I'm Matthew. Matthew tells stories. You know who else tells stories? Mark and Luke and John. All the disciples like to tell stories about Jesus. This is a story. It's a true story. Back way back in the Bible in the book of Isaiah. The king Ahaz was afraid because he was the king of Jerusalem and there was an army forming against him. And it was two countries that made a deal with each other. It was the country of Syria &gt;&gt; and it was the country of Israel. So remember Israel and Judah had split apart. Judah was Was Judah in the north or the south? Who hasn't who hasn't got candy yet? &gt;&gt; I didn't. &gt;&gt; Okay. Was Judah in the north or the south? In the south? &gt;&gt; Judah was in the south. Israel was where? &gt;&gt; In the north. Right. So we have Israel in the north. Judah in the south and Israel makes a deal with this creepy king of Syria and they are going to come in and they are going to invade Jerusalem. All right. Invade me. What does invade mean? &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on. &gt;&gt; Like if Yeah. Right. Say it again. &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. Good job. Invade means to take over. So this army was forming between these two kingdoms. The one &gt;&gt; what's their name? &gt;&gt; You want to know the name? &gt;&gt; Syria. &gt;&gt; Syria. And who is the king of Syria? Nobody knows. Anybody knows? Reason like candy kind of not spelled that way but reason. And there was this other the son of the king of Israel his name was Pah. So they make this deal and they are going to invade um Jerusalem and they are and this king Ahaz he's afraid. So he goes so the prophet comes to him comes to the king who hasn't got candy yet. You haven't got candy. What was the prophet's name? I just said it. I said it a while ago. Look at you. Good job. &gt;&gt; Right. Isaiah was the prophet. He goes to the king Ahaz and he says, "Listen," he says, "God is going to protect you." All right, you with me? He says, "No, you're you're strong. You're going to be able to get out of this. God is going to protect you from these two kings that are coming down." So the king Ahaz, he tells the Lord tells Ahaz to seek after a sign. You know what a sign is? &gt;&gt; A spiritual sign. A spiritual sign is something that God gives that doesn't usually happen. So there was this man I I'll tell you what a sign is. There was this man named Gideon. One time he was seeking a sign from God and he said, ' Lord, if this is your will, then I'm going to lay out this piece of sheepkin and if the dew comes on the ground and not the sheep skin, then I'll know it's you. Well, it did. The dew came on the ground and not the sheep skin. So then he says, well, let me just want I want to make sure I want another sign that let the dew come on the sheepkin and not the ground. God did both. So that's a sign. So the Lord tells this king Ahaz, he says, "So seek after a sign." He says, "A big sign. Anything that you ask for and I am going to do it." Well, the king was afraid. He says, "No, I don't want to seek after a sign. I'm kind of I don't want to test the Lord." And then the prophet tells Isaiah, he says, "The Lord will send you a sign." You with me? He said, "A virgin will conceive and bear a son and his name will be called Emmanuel." All right. So, Matthew, as I am studying this, the Lord protected Ahaz, but I never saw this sign ever fulfilled, this prophecy. Way back hundreds of years, it didn't happen. So, when is God going to give this sign? And when I heard the story of Jesus, I saw that The prophecy was not fulfilled with Ahaz, but it was fulfilled with this man Jesus. This baby, remember, who was born in a manger and his mother had never been with a man. So 7 800 years, right? And his name was Jesus. And he was called &gt;&gt; Yes. Say it louder. And what does Emanuel mean? &gt;&gt; Christ, &gt;&gt; it means God with us. &gt;&gt; And that was the fulfillment. So, as I see I'm I'm I'm studying and I see that this wasn't fulfilled in Isaiah. But when I wrote it down in my book of Isaiah when I first started the book, I wanted the people to know that this was the prophecy that wasn't fulfilled with Ahaz. This was the prophecy that the prophet gave. This was fulfilled in this man Jesus. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Do you understand? very very important. What questions do you have for me, Matthew, about anything? &gt;&gt; How long did you live? &gt;&gt; How long did I live? Well, I didn't live very long. &gt;&gt; Oh, how long did Jesus live? Jesus &gt;&gt; on the earth, Jesus lived about 33 years. But how long did I live? Me, Matthew, I didn't live very long. So after Jesus went up to be with the father, after he was he was crucified and he rose after the third day and he went up to be with the father, I started preaching. All right? I preached around in in Jerusalem there and then I went to a far away land and this king wanted to marry this young girl and I told him you are sinning and I said it in front of everyone and that king had me killed because I stood for Jesus and that's how Matthew died. Yeah. Next question. You got &gt;&gt; You could tell me how I got healed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Killed. How did I get killed? &gt;&gt; Got beheaded. &gt;&gt; Matthew, I want to remember if I got beheaded or not. &gt;&gt; Jesus lived 33 years old till they killed a mother. &gt;&gt; Let's see. Joseph, how old are you? &gt;&gt; 30. So everybody turn around and look at brother Joseph. Jesus was just barely older than him when he was put to death on the cross. Okay, turn back and look at me. Any other questions from for Matthew? &gt;&gt; Anybody? &gt;&gt; Chloe, &gt;&gt; I did. They're not in the Bible, but I wanted to tell everybody about Jesus. I wanted to tell every about buddy about my experience with with this man. I wanted to tell everyone how he did all of these miracles. I wanted to tell everyone that if you just go back and you look at the Old Testament that you can find Jesus in the Old Testament like I did in Isaiah where this this prophecy that was given by Isaiah was fulfilled when Jesus was born in the manger. I wanted to tell everybody. So, Chloe, yeah, I did. I wanted to tell everybody. But my letter was in was in this book. And guess what language I wrote it in? &gt;&gt; Hebrew. &gt;&gt; That's a good answer because you would think I wrote it in Hebrew. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But I didn't write it in Hebrew. &gt;&gt; Greek. Greek. &gt;&gt; I wrote it in Greek. Does anybody know why I wrote my letter in Greek? &gt;&gt; Because you were Greek. &gt;&gt; No, I was not Greek. I was Hebrew. &gt;&gt; Adam. Greek as Adams. Did you get candy yet? Okay. As Adam said, Greek was the common language. So I wrote my letter not in Hebrew so all the all the Jews could read it. I read it. I wrote it in Greek so it could go around the world and other people who didn't speak Hebrew, but almost everybody spoke Greek could read it. Have you ever heard of evangelism? evangelist. I was an evangelist. I went out and told people about Jesus. That was what I did after. And I preached it in Greek because they spoke Greek. Izzy, question. &gt;&gt; Why do I think that my book comes first? Because it's the best. Next qu [laughter] the the reason I think that Matthew's book comes first. Now I wrote my book and it's very very well researched and I was there when Jesus did all of these things. So, it's a very very important book. But the reason that my book is first is probably because Mark, he was with us and then Luke, they all go in the same order. And mine, because it's probably the most comprehensive, mine is first. But the reason John's is last is because it goes in a different order. Still just as true as mine is, but John's is a little bit different. The other ones are pretty well. They're the same, just different perspectives, but John's has a much different perspective. John does a little bit more preaching than we did. Question. &gt;&gt; How did you get killed? &gt;&gt; I you already answered that. I don't really remember, but it was because I told that king that he shouldn't be living bad. Yeah. What was my favorite I scripture I wrote? Let me think. You know, I wrote in my 10th chapter, I wrote, "He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward." So when I receive someone, I get the blessings of being friends with them. If I receive a prophet, I get the blessings of being with a prophet or accepting a prophet. If I receive a good man or a good a good woman, if I if I'm their friend, then I get the benefit of that. But as I think about it, I think it's one of the last things I wrote. Who you did you ask it or did Chloe ask it? You asked it. In my very end of my book, I wrote, you know what? Let me read it. It's pretty cool reading your own writing. Matthew chapter 28:1 19 says this, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations." All right. Teach them what? &gt;&gt; About Jesus. &gt;&gt; How do I know that? Because of the next verse. Bapt baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. And then what did we do when we went and baptized? &gt;&gt; We washed them out. &gt;&gt; We baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. But what I was saying here, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost, I was saying that you need to baptize in the name of God. And what is the name of God? Jesus. teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. The Lord Jesus speaking. So that's probably my favorite one. Any more questions, Liam? &gt;&gt; My name is Matthew &gt;&gt; and my book is long, so I speak long. &gt;&gt; Any more questions, Liam? &gt;&gt; I mean Liam, I mean Asher. One more question about any more questions about Matthew &gt;&gt; 28. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I think it is &gt;&gt; either Matthew or Luke. I think I think Luke might have edged me out a little bit because he he did a lot of research. &gt;&gt; Who was my friend? Well, I had a I had a bunch of friends. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me let me let me finish with with this question about who was my friend. Um, I didn't have many friends. And this is this is going to be the last question that I answer. I didn't have many friends because &gt;&gt; because nobody liked me. &gt;&gt; Nobody liked me. They didn't like me because I didn't live &gt;&gt; a lot of friends. &gt;&gt; I didn't I didn't have a I didn't have a lot of friends until Jesus came. &gt;&gt; And now listen, nobody liked me. I grew up and I I started this work and being a tax collector and I made a lot of money, but &gt;&gt; I cheated my friends out of their money. So, does anybody know what taxes are? Your parents do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, what I would do is is Rome who who required the taxes, I would say, let's say, brother brother Joseph and sister Zyra, I would say that you owe $2,000. Well, Rome would tell me, I would look at my book and Rome would tell me that Zyra and Joseph owe $2,000 in taxes. Okay? So, then I would go to them and I would say that will be $3,000. And then they would look at the book and they'd say, "Well, I just owe $2,000." And I'd say, "Yeah, I know. That'll be $3,000. and if you don't give me my $3,000, I'm going to take your donkey and I'm going to take your land and I'm going to take whatever it takes to get my extra thousand dollar. So, what I was doing is I was cheating my own people. And people hated me because I cheated them. But then when I met Jesus, I I stopped cheating because then I saw that I was doing wrong. And when you meet Jesus and you're doing wrong, something in your life wants to change. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Something in your life wants to change when you meet Jesus. Then you know you're doing wrong. And when I met him, I knew I was doing wrong. So that's why I didn't have any friends. But then when I met Jesus and I changed, then I had a lot of friends. Good. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. But because he died, we can live forever. Okay. Go back to your seats. &gt;&gt; Did anybody not get candy a piece? Get out of here. You guys cheating like tax collectors. &gt;&gt; Any any questions from the parents about the book of Matthew? You see, when Matthew was there, you can imagine when Jesus walked by and here's here's this guy Matthew. There's another tax collector named Zakius that had a similar testimony as Matthew. Everybody hated his guts. He was a cheater. He was a liar. He was an absolute creep. And then Jesus walks by and Matthew says, "You know what? I'm going to leave all of my riches. I'm going to leave everything. I'm going to become a poor man and I am going to follow Jesus." And you know what it resulted in? All of the disciples except one. It it resulted in their death. And I, Matthew, knew I was going to my death. In fact, I remember when Jesus was going down on the mountain, he said that you're going to suffer from knowing me. You're going to suffer for being my friend, but you're blessed if you do suffer. And we do and Christians. And now 2,000 years later, you can see that you will suffer for being a true Christian, for standing up for Jesus. You will suffer as Matthew suffered, as Paul suffered, as John the Revelator suffered on the aisle of Patmas. We will all suffer. But it is better to suffer now than to suffer over on the other side. You with me? Any any questions? Any more questions from Matthew? Do you like children's church? &gt;&gt; I do too. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to get some of the older ones involved next time and we'll see. This is this is the birth of Christ that we're celebrating now. Maybe next time we'll uh we'll be on a series and uh we'll move in that direction. But, uh, we'll always have a theme and we're always going to have a preacher and I want to get some of the older ones involved and start ministering and start talking about the Lord and start witnessing. And this is this builds. I wish I had this Paul when I was little that I could I had the confidence to witness to other people. If you can stand in front of 50, 60, 70 people, however many people we have, if you can stand in front of them as a young man and minister, then you can certainly witness to your friends. Amen. Brother Jordan, thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; The last word in Matthew was it amen? Is that correct? Let's sing that song. Amen. Amen. And I don't know, Sister Abby, if you have the words to the version I'm going to do here. So, we'll try it. You guys don't actually have to sing that part, but you guys can do the echo part. When we get to the verses, brother Daniel, you can help me and all the adults. I'll say something like, "See the baby." And you all say, "Amen." Yep. Like that. So, all right. Let's sing the chorus first. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. See the little baby lying in the manger on Christmas morning. Amen. Amen. See him at the temple talking to the elders. How they marveled at all his wisdom. Amen. Amen. See him at the seaside &gt;&gt; talking to the fishermen. A and making them disciples. Amen. Oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's stand this evening. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We had one song that we was requested to sing as a congregation. They said it was a happy song. So, we're going to sing We're Going to a Mansion on the Happy Day Express. Then we'll sing maybe a might become a theme song for Children's Church and we'll dismiss. Amen.
