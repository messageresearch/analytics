[0:00] will bow
[0:02] and every tongue confess the name of
[0:06] Jesus.
[0:08] [Music]
[0:10] Jesus.
[0:14] [Music]
[0:20] If we truly put him first and put him in
[0:23] the center of our lives, then we never
[0:25] have a worry in the world. If we can
[0:28] just do that. Let's pray. Our father,
[0:33] Lord, as you're in heaven looking down
[0:35] upon us,
[0:37] we ask Lord that our worship would come
[0:39] up before you as the incense of old
[0:42] would come up before you from the altar.
[0:44] May our prayers come up before you in
[0:47] the name of Jesus Christ. And Father,
[0:50] may they be heard in your ears.
[0:53] Lord, would you answer? We pray.
[0:57] visit us, Father, this morning.
[1:00] Pray that you would be welcome here.
[1:03] And Lord, that you would speak to the
[1:05] hearts of all of us. And Lord, that we
[1:08] might leave this service this morning
[1:13] closer to you. Granted, Father, in Jesus
[1:16] name. Amen. Amen. Thank you. You can be

[3:17] Welcome. Good to see you,
[3:22] brother Paul. Just you look like you fit
[3:24] in perfect in Scotland, man.
[3:27] I always said he looks like Shan Connory
[3:29] and he just
[3:31] glad to glad to have you back. Um,
[3:35] so, uh, Brother Ed mentioned that we
[3:37] have a lot of construction going on.
[3:38] That's what these lines are. These lines
[3:40] are actually what happened is they
[3:41] pulled the carpet back. They shaved
[3:44] down. There's a big ridge in the middle
[3:45] of the church here. They shaved it down
[3:48] so we can um, lay the carpet. Brother Ed
[3:51] was quick to point out that now we have
[3:54] seating in the front is first class. The
[3:57] middle is economy plus and the back is
[4:02] just economy. So So you all are in in
[4:06] first class here this morning. Brother
[4:08] Ed sent me a picture of the tape and um
[4:11] so yeah, it's uh it's good to have it.
[4:13] So, we're going to continue on with the
[4:15] construction.
[4:16] And the next step is uh in a couple
[4:20] weeks, if the Lord's willing, we will
[4:22] rip out all of the this carpet. We're
[4:24] going to replace it with a new carpet.
[4:26] And uh so there's going to be a lot of
[4:29] um just a lot of things going on.
[4:30] Brother Ed mentioned that we're going to
[4:32] put replace a glass back there. There's
[4:34] going to be some railings put up. We
[4:35] need to finish the railings up in the
[4:37] balcony. So, quite a bit of
[4:38] construction. And with that, we also
[4:41] have quite a few people missing. We have
[4:43] all kinds of people missing either on
[4:45] vacation, traveling. Um so what we're
[4:48] going to do for August and September is
[4:52] we are only going to have Sunday evening
[4:55] service every other service. So tonight
[4:58] we will not have Sunday evening service.
[5:01] Next week we will have Sunday evening
[5:03] service and that's because of all the
[5:05] people missing all the construction and
[5:07] everything that's going on. So, um, we
[5:10] will do that August and September and
[5:13] then we will get back to our normal
[5:14] schedule in October.
[5:17] Um, I think that's it for the
[5:18] announcements. We're looking forward to
[5:20] we got the the wheelchair ramp poured
[5:23] back there. We're looking forward to
[5:24] getting this done and then if the Lord's
[5:26] willing in um October, November time
[5:30] frame, we will probably once we finish
[5:32] all the sanctuary, we will have meetings
[5:34] and we will rededicate the church.
[5:37] really looking forward to that
[5:40] recap on last week. We started a series
[5:43] on prayer. And I think it's really I
[5:46] think it's the most important thing
[5:48] that's in our lives is praying. It's
[5:52] fellowship between us and the Lord. And
[5:55] I hope that you remembered from last
[5:58] Sunday that God wants to talk to us more
[6:01] than we want to talk to him. He created
[6:04] the Garden of Eden for his children and
[6:07] then he's preparing a place now for his
[6:10] children to go back to that is going to
[6:12] be an eternal place of joy and peace.
[6:16] Talked about last week that the Bible it
[6:20] is uh neither a science book nor is it a
[6:22] history book and it's not meant to be
[6:24] read like that. The Bible is a book of
[6:27] relationship from the start to the
[6:29] finish. It's a relationship between God
[6:34] and his children and us. So when we are
[6:37] reading this Bible, we can place
[6:39] ourselves into the word and we can learn
[6:43] more about God and how it pleases God
[6:46] for us to commune with him. And it
[6:48] really it all comes back to prayer. We
[6:50] went through Genesis 1 and showed how
[6:53] God created everything for his children.
[6:56] And at the end again, he wants us to be
[6:59] with him in eternity. Told the story and
[7:03] I hope you remember this. I told the
[7:04] story of the of the purchase price. And
[7:06] if you buy something,
[7:09] if you spend whatever money on whatever
[7:11] item it is, that purchase price,
[7:15] it was worth it to you to pay that money
[7:19] for that item. So that item that you
[7:22] bought was worth to you more probably
[7:26] than what you paid for it. And that is
[7:29] our souls. God gave his only begotten
[7:33] son.
[7:35] And we were worth
[7:39] this life of his son Jesus Christ. The
[7:42] purchase price. That's how much we are
[7:44] worth to God is that he would give his
[7:47] son.
[7:49] And it is very very important
[7:53] that our way of communing with God and
[7:56] our way of speaking with God, our way of
[7:59] fellowshipping with God is through
[8:01] prayer. It should be the number one
[8:04] thing in all of our lives. And so often
[8:07] it's the thing that suffers the most.
[8:09] But prayer is the most important thing
[8:12] that we can do. More important than
[8:13] reading our Bible, more important than
[8:16] going to work, more importing important
[8:19] than eating or drinking is prayer. It
[8:22] should be number one. I looked up a
[8:25] couple we'll continue on with prayer
[8:27] this morning. I want to talk about
[8:28] Jonah. U but before we get into that, I
[8:31] looked up a couple a few facts about
[8:33] prayer in the Bible. I got this from
[8:36] gospelcoalition.org.
[8:38] Um these are very interesting. We have
[8:41] record of Jesus praying about 25 times
[8:45] in the four gospels. Can you imagine the
[8:47] son of God, God himself in flesh praying
[8:51] and praying not just once but 25 times
[8:55] we have that he's either referring to
[8:56] prayer or praying. If the son of god had
[9:01] to pray that much how much more do we
[9:02] have to pray Moses we have him praying
[9:06] about 20 times. David. Many, many
[9:10] prayers that King David prayed. If you
[9:12] count the Psalms with the Apostle Paul,
[9:15] up to 41 times, Paul is either praying
[9:18] or he mentions prayer. The greatest men
[9:22] in the entire Bible are really the ones
[9:24] that prayed the most. There are about
[9:27] five different
[9:30] positions listed in prayer. So often we
[9:33] ask, Lord, how do you want me to pray?
[9:35] Am I supposed to kneel? Am I supposed to
[9:37] stand? It's there. There's different
[9:42] times. There's one time that Jesus or
[9:46] that God instructs to that was sitting
[9:49] when they're praying. Nathan came to the
[9:51] prophet. Nathan the prophet came to
[9:53] David and tell to tell him that he
[9:56] couldn't build the temple but his son
[9:57] would. And um it says this, then when
[10:01] King David went in, he sat before the
[10:05] Lord and said, "Who am I, oh Lord, and
[10:07] what is my house that thou has brought
[10:09] me hither to?" So David sat and prayed.
[10:13] Standing and praying. Jesus said in Mark
[10:16] Mark 11, he says, "When you stand
[10:19] praying, forgive if you ought to if you
[10:22] have ought against any other that your
[10:25] father also which is in heaven may also
[10:28] forgive forgive you of your trespasses."
[10:30] And kneeling in prayer, Daniel 6, Luke
[10:33] 22, Acts 7, Acts 9, Acts 20, Acts 21,
[10:38] Ephesians 3, Daniel and then back to
[10:41] Daniel. Daniel knelt in prayer with his
[10:45] windows open and he kneelled before the
[10:47] Lord and faced Jerusalem, faced the
[10:49] temple at Jerusalem when he prayed. 1
[10:52] Timothy chapter 2, Paul says that you
[10:55] lift up holy hands. He says, I will
[10:57] therefore that men pray everywhere,
[10:59] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[11:01] without doubting.
[11:03] And it's so the Bible teaches us that
[11:07] many many there's not a specific way or
[11:10] or a specific posture that we have in
[11:12] praying. There's other places where
[11:14] Jesus he he laid down with his with his
[11:16] face to the ground and prayed. So
[11:20] there's not a specific way that we have
[11:22] to pray and not a more reverent way. We
[11:25] need to pray as the Lord leads us to
[11:27] pray. When we pray, we always say the
[11:30] word amen.
[11:32] Amen. As we know it means so be it. It
[11:35] means let it be.
[11:37] Something on the order of let these
[11:39] things that I have just prayed let them
[11:41] be so. When we say amen at the end of
[11:44] our prayer. There are about 650
[11:48] prayers in the Bible. And there about
[11:51] 450 answered prayers in the Bible. So
[11:55] prayer is a very very important thing.
[11:58] just me and I I'll give a short
[12:00] testimony of just me last week.
[12:03] Stephanie and I were kind of worried
[12:04] about some things that are coming up and
[12:06] I just had a lot of anxiety about just
[12:10] some personal um situations that we may
[12:13] have to overcome and just worrying about
[12:16] it and worrying about it. And before I
[12:19] went to come out on a Wednesday night
[12:22] last week, I believe it was,
[12:26] I was just worrying about it in my
[12:27] office. And then I said, "Wait a minute.
[12:30] How many times have I encouraged other
[12:33] people to pray and to lay these things
[12:35] in the hands of the Lord and the Lord?"
[12:38] And as soon as my knees
[12:42] hit the floor, the Lord took all of the
[12:45] burden away. He talk all of the anxiety
[12:48] away and I just placed it into his hands
[12:50] because I know that he's he's gonna take
[12:52] care of me that it's going to be
[12:53] whatever happens whether it be in church
[12:55] or whether it happens with with our
[12:57] families whatever it would be if we
[12:58] would just lay it into his hands he has
[13:01] our best interest in mind and he wants
[13:04] to take care of us
[13:07] and it's a bit sad and I can say this in
[13:10] my own personal life and you can
[13:11] probably too that the times that I have
[13:14] been closest to God are the times that
[13:17] have been the hardest in my life. It's
[13:20] the times that I've had to overcome or
[13:21] the times that bad things happened or
[13:23] the times that maybe I made mistakes and
[13:26] I fell and I had to come back to God.
[13:29] And those are the times that I had
[13:32] there's nothing that I could do. I
[13:34] couldn't take the situation into my own
[13:35] hands and I would put it into the hands
[13:38] of the Lord and then he would take care
[13:41] of it and that faith would rise up in
[13:43] me. But it to me it's sad that we have
[13:45] to make a mistake or we have to go
[13:47] through bad things before we put things
[13:50] into the hands of God. We should be
[13:51] praying like we have a terrible thing
[13:55] coming. We should be praying like that
[13:56] all of the time. Just put it in into his
[14:00] hands. Put our lives into his hands
[14:02] every day.
[14:04] was um I have a friend that right now
[14:10] in the past and over the past couple
[14:12] weeks he has spent
[14:16] time praying. He went to a place that he
[14:19] felt that the Lord would heal would hear
[14:22] him. And he has been praying for his
[14:26] family
[14:28] and his family, none of them would he
[14:32] consider
[14:34] uh believers. They don't want to follow
[14:37] the Lord like he's following it. And he
[14:40] has just been praying and and there was
[14:43] there was one day that he spent 24 hours
[14:46] in prayer. didn't eat, didn't drink,
[14:49] just stayed in prayer the whole time.
[14:51] And I know him and I see that his
[14:56] motives
[14:58] are not correct. And I don't know if the
[15:01] Lord's going to hear those prayers
[15:03] because he has in his mind what he wants
[15:06] his children and what he wants his wife
[15:09] to be.
[15:11] And he's praying that they would come to
[15:14] the Lord and see things the way that he
[15:17] sees things. And he should be really
[15:19] praying, Lord, I want what you want. I
[15:23] want my children, I want my wife to have
[15:26] a personal relationship with me. They
[15:28] don't have to come and see things the
[15:31] way I see things. I want them to just
[15:34] know you, dear God. That is what he
[15:38] should be. And I I see that he is trying
[15:41] to pull them in a certain way and they
[15:43] just don't want to go in that way. And
[15:46] instead really of getting together and
[15:50] asking God what Lord, what do you want?
[15:55] He is instead asking the Lord. He's
[15:58] really putting the Lord in a box and
[16:01] saying, Lord, here is what I want. I
[16:04] want them to be coming to come to church
[16:05] with me. I want them to act like this. I
[16:08] want them to believe like this. And
[16:10] really, he should just be surrendering.
[16:12] And that is the kind of prayer that God
[16:14] hears. He hears a complete surrender. I
[16:18] had another friend a while ago that he
[16:22] was really struggling. He wanted to
[16:26] homeschool his kids and his wife didn't
[16:29] want to. And there was just a battle
[16:32] going on in the family and it was really
[16:33] taking a toll on their on their
[16:35] marriage. And he told me the next day he
[16:40] came and came to my office and he says
[16:42] he says yeah he says I was praying last
[16:45] night he says my wife was praying and he
[16:47] said I laid my hands on my hand on her
[16:50] and I said dear Lord will you show her
[16:54] that she's wrong in this.
[16:59] I said dude you're lucky you got that
[17:02] hand back.
[17:04] That's not the way that you approach
[17:06] prayer.
[17:08] When you approach prayer that you're
[17:10] together in this and you say, "Lord,
[17:13] what is your will in these things?" We
[17:15] want to find what your perfect will is
[17:18] for our family because it might be right
[17:19] for this family and it might not be
[17:22] right for that family. The one thing
[17:23] that we know is always right is that we
[17:26] approach Jesus Christ. He is the way,
[17:29] the truth, and the life. He is the king.
[17:31] He is it. And if we would approach him
[17:34] and ask him, Lord, what is right in our
[17:37] family? Then the Lord will speak to us
[17:40] instead of having our preconceived
[17:42] notions about these things. Lord, we
[17:45] want what you want and we surrender.
[17:50] Remember also who we are praying to. St.
[17:54] John, let's let's read St. John 14:1.
[17:57] Jesus says this.
[18:01] Jesus says, "Let not your heart be
[18:03] troubled.
[18:05] You believe in God, believe also in me.
[18:08] In my father's house are many mansions.
[18:11] If it were not so, I would have told
[18:13] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[18:17] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[18:20] I will come again and receive unto
[18:22] receive you unto myself, that where I
[18:24] am, you may be also." Remember last
[18:27] Sunday's lesson? Jesus's desire, God's
[18:30] desire is to have fellowship with his
[18:33] children. And Jesus's greatest desire is
[18:36] for us to be with him in heaven.
[18:39] He is preparing a place for us to spend
[18:42] eternity or at least the next thousand
[18:44] years. He is working on this place and
[18:46] it's going to be like the Garden of
[18:48] Eden. It's going to be perfect and he
[18:50] wants us to be there. That's his desire.
[18:52] We get all we get all kinds of things in
[18:54] our heads, but we have to remember what
[18:57] God wants. Verse number four. And
[19:00] whether I go, you know, and the way you
[19:02] know. NIV says, you know the way to the
[19:07] place where I am going.
[19:09] Thomas, one of his disciples, was
[19:12] listening to this and and he was like,
[19:14] what? I don't get it.
[19:17] I don't get what the Lord what Jesus is
[19:19] saying.
[19:22] And Jesus
[19:23] and Thomas said unto him,"Lord, we know
[19:26] not whether thou goest, and how can we
[19:28] know the way?" NIV is a little bit
[19:31] easier to understand. It says, "Lord, we
[19:33] don't know where you are going, so how
[19:35] can we know the way?"
[19:37] Jesus said unto him, "I am the way, the
[19:41] truth, and the life. No man cometh to
[19:44] the Father but by me."
[19:47] What does that mean?
[19:49] No one comes to the father except
[19:51] through me. We always think it's
[19:53] salvation.
[19:55] We always think that well you to be
[19:57] saved to have eternal life that you have
[20:00] to come through the lord Jesus which is
[20:01] true but that's not all that he said. He
[20:06] said no one can come to the father
[20:07] except by me.
[20:11] And the same goes for our prayers.
[20:14] When we approach God, it is through
[20:16] Jesus Christ and him alone. How can
[20:19] anyone expect God to hear a prayer if it
[20:23] is not through Jesus Christ? Jesus said,
[20:27] "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[20:29] No one no one can come to the father
[20:30] except by me." So when we pray, it must
[20:34] be according to Christ and him only. We
[20:39] can't have it through our way of
[20:41] thinking or we can't even really have it
[20:43] through our desires.
[20:45] We don't put a God in a bo God in a box.
[20:48] I say that a lot. We always want him to
[20:51] fit our mold of what God should be. We
[20:53] approach him, we should approach him as
[20:55] the almighty God. And Lord, I am just
[20:58] trying to find your will in all of this
[21:01] and say, "Yeah, I don't care, Lord. I
[21:03] don't care what you how you do it. I
[21:05] don't care what it what ends up, but
[21:08] just please get me Lord out of this mess
[21:11] that I've got myself into
[21:13] or pray that that Lord help my family or
[21:16] whatever it is. Or better yet, we pray
[21:19] to him
[21:21] all the time and we give him our prayers
[21:22] and our thanks and we give him our love
[21:25] all the time and not just when we have a
[21:27] a problem. Paul said that we pray
[21:31] always. That's the best way. It's not
[21:34] just when we need something. How would I
[21:37] like to have a friend that just calls me
[21:40] when he needs something? How would I
[21:43] like to have kids that just talk to me
[21:46] when they need something? That's that's
[21:49] not that's not a good relationship.
[21:52] So whether we pray on our knees, whether
[21:54] we pray standing, whether we pray
[21:55] sitting, whether whatever we whatever we
[21:58] are doing, we just say, "Lord, just hear
[22:00] my prayer. I need you."
[22:03] And we suffer
[22:05] as I said just now that suffering is
[22:08] part of it because it drives us to God.
[22:12] We ask what are we praying for? And I
[22:14] asked like like my friend that's praying
[22:16] for his family.
[22:18] What are you asking for with your
[22:21] children?
[22:23] Are you asking that they start coming to
[22:25] church with you to your church? Are you
[22:29] asking that they start dressing like you
[22:32] want them to dress? Are you asking that
[22:33] that they start seeing things the way
[22:35] that you want them to see it? Or are you
[22:37] asking that they have a relationship
[22:41] with the Almighty where they are talking
[22:44] to him directly? Is that what you're
[22:47] praying? Is that what we should be
[22:49] praying? Lord, I want my son, I want my
[22:52] daughter, I want them to have a
[22:53] relationship with you. I want my wife to
[22:56] have this relationship with you. I want
[22:58] your spirit to be in our family all the
[23:01] time to where we are just fellowshipping
[23:03] around you and we can open up the Bible
[23:05] and we can say Lord we want to know what
[23:07] this means and we are together in this
[23:09] rather than having a preconceived notion
[23:12] on how we should be
[23:15] but pray and ask Lord let my son let my
[23:20] daughter my wife my husband let that
[23:24] person have a relationship with you.
[23:29] And if they're talking to you and you're
[23:30] talking back, that is communion. And
[23:33] that's what we're all seeking or we
[23:34] should be seeking.
[23:38] Then you might ask, and I have in my
[23:40] notes here, how do I hear the voice of
[23:43] God? And that's that's the thing that so
[23:46] many people ask, how do I know it's God
[23:50] speaking? How do how do I know that it's
[23:54] him talking? And he speaks to us in
[23:58] different ways. You're going to see how
[23:59] he spoke to a prophet in a little bit,
[24:02] but he spoke to Elijah in a still small
[24:05] voice.
[24:07] He spoke to David in a wind going
[24:12] through the malberry trees.
[24:14] He spoke to Peter in a vision while he
[24:16] was on the housetop.
[24:18] He spoke to Paul
[24:21] in a light, a blinding light. He speaks
[24:24] to us in different ways, but it's always
[24:26] purposeful. And if you really get word
[24:29] from the Lord, and many of you have had
[24:33] experiences, if he really speaks to you,
[24:35] no matter how it is, it may be an
[24:37] audible voice, it may just be, I just
[24:40] know he spoke to me. Or it may be, Lord,
[24:42] I need something out of your word. And
[24:44] you may turn to a scripture and oh that
[24:47] answers my question. But you know when
[24:50] God speaks to you and when he speaks a
[24:52] volume of books couldn't have as much
[24:55] knowledge as you just got. And it may
[24:57] just be one sentence that God speaks to
[24:58] you. And I know I've been there where he
[25:01] just spoke a little bit and it opened up
[25:05] an entire it just it it fulfilled a an
[25:10] enormous number of questions. It told it
[25:13] gave me the answers for those.
[25:17] Now, watch the Lord. We're going to get
[25:19] into this man Jonah. Now, watch how God
[25:23] speaks with Jonah and watch Jonah's
[25:27] response. And watch Jonah's weaknesses.
[25:29] Jonah was not perfect. He's like
[25:31] everybody in the Bible except one. He
[25:34] was not perfect and he made plenty of
[25:37] mistakes. And we're going to read about
[25:40] how this prophet was running, actually
[25:43] running from God.
[25:46] Jonah, we'll summarize the book of
[25:48] Jonah. He was he was um as I said, he
[25:52] was a prophet. He was called to preach
[25:55] to a city of pagan people, not Jewish
[26:01] people. Remember the Old Testament is
[26:02] all about one lineage from Adam to
[26:06] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob to the sons of
[26:10] Jacob. We call them the sons of Israel,
[26:12] the children of Israel. They go out and
[26:14] then we have Moses and we have Elijah
[26:16] and we have all of these different
[26:18] prophets. And it's all pretty much in
[26:20] this lineage of people that we call the
[26:22] Jews.
[26:24] And this man Jonah was one of these
[26:27] prophets. And he was called not to
[26:29] preach to Jews, not to correct his own
[26:32] people, but to these worldly bunch of
[26:36] pagan people in this city called
[26:38] Nineveh. Jonah didn't want to do it. How
[26:42] could God call Jonah?
[26:46] Jonah might say, "How could you call me
[26:48] to this bunch of evil people? I know
[26:51] they're not even your people, God. So,
[26:54] how could you? I must be wrong in what
[26:56] I'm thinking." So instead of going to
[26:59] this city of Nineveh,
[27:02] Jonah has it in his mind, well, I'll go
[27:04] to this city, Tarses.
[27:07] That's probably more along what God
[27:09] would want. And we have to be careful in
[27:11] making God's decisions for him. We have
[27:14] to be careful in saying, well, here's
[27:15] what the Lord would want because it
[27:16] makes sense in my mind. This did not
[27:19] make sense, but God, it was God. He's
[27:21] sovereign. He knows what's best. He sent
[27:24] Jonah to this place. But no, Jonah
[27:26] decides he's going to go to this other
[27:28] city of Tarsus. He jumps on a boat,
[27:32] jumps on a ship. They start sailing to
[27:34] Tarsus. God sends this great storm.
[27:41] They end up Jonah ends up confessing to
[27:45] the people, "It was me. This is the
[27:47] reason the storm." They take Jonah. They
[27:49] throw him overboard. The The storm
[27:52] stops. This big whale comes up and
[27:55] swallows Jonah. He's in the whale for
[27:58] the for three days. The whale probably
[28:00] goes down and hangs out at the bottom of
[28:01] the ocean. He's there for three days.
[28:04] And Jonah prays while he's in this belly
[28:06] of the whale. After three days, the
[28:09] whale swims up to the shore, spits him
[28:12] out. Jonah now has a new commission and
[28:15] same commission as he did before, but
[28:18] now it's more real to him. He gets up,
[28:21] makes a trip to Nineveh, and preaches to
[28:23] the people of Nineveh, and they repent.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; And not only do they repent, but even
[28:30] the people on the boat, the ship repent.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to Jonah. We'll get through
[28:36] the first two chapters of Jonah, which
[28:40] is I believe what um that'll close this
[28:43] message on this section of our series on
[28:45] prayer.
[28:47] Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah
[28:50] the son of Amiti saying and go to
[28:53] Nineveh that great city and cry out
[28:55] against it for their wickedness has come
[28:57] up before me. Now the word of the Lord
[28:59] came to Jonah. How did it come? We don't
[29:02] know.
[29:04] And that's the thing. We think that it
[29:06] was just God speaking
[29:08] to Jonah lip to ear. But it doesn't say
[29:11] how.
[29:13] It may have been a vision like Peter
[29:15] had.
[29:17] It may have been like Daniel who got the
[29:20] word of the Lord by reading from the
[29:22] prophet Jeremiah.
[29:25] It may have been that. It may have been
[29:27] a number of things. We don't know. But
[29:29] we know that God sent his word to Jonah
[29:33] and says, "Go to Nineveh, that great
[29:35] city, and cry out against it, for their
[29:37] wickedness has come up before me.
[29:43] So God tells Jonah to go to this pagan
[29:45] place and but Jonah rose up to flee to
[29:47] Tarsus from the presence of the Lord and
[29:50] went down to Japa and he found a ship
[29:52] going to Tarsus. So he paid the fair
[29:54] thereof and went down into it to go with
[29:57] them into unto Tarsus for the from the
[30:00] presence of the Lord.
[30:03] When we choose our path,
[30:06] no matter what path that is, if we
[30:09] choose our path rather than the path
[30:12] that God sets before us, no matter how
[30:15] religious we are, no matter how much we
[30:18] pray, no matter how much we try to get
[30:21] God to see things our way, we leave the
[30:26] presence of God. As I said, no matter
[30:29] how religious we are, no matter how good
[30:30] we are living, when we go our way,
[30:35] aside from God's way, we leave his
[30:37] presence.
[30:39] But the Lord sent out a great wind into
[30:41] the sea. And there was a mighty tempest
[30:44] in the sea, so that the ship was like to
[30:46] be broken. Then the mariners were
[30:48] afraid, and cried every man unto his
[30:51] God. Remember that. and cried every man
[30:53] unto his God, and cast forth the wares
[30:56] that were in the ship into the sea, and
[30:59] to to lighten it of them. But Jonah was
[31:02] gone down into the sides of the ship,
[31:04] and he lay and was fast asleep. Every
[31:08] man cried unto his God.
[31:12] It's not capitalized there, and neither
[31:14] does that represent Jehovah. These
[31:16] mariners were pagans. These mariners had
[31:19] their own gods. They were not believers.
[31:21] This is important in a few verses.
[31:24] So the shipmaster came to him and said
[31:26] unto him, "What meanest thou, oh
[31:28] sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, if so
[31:31] be that God will think upon us that we
[31:33] perish not." And they said, "Everyone to
[31:36] his fellow, come and let us cast lots,
[31:38] that we may know for whose cause this
[31:41] evil is upon us." So they cast lots, and
[31:43] the lot fell upon Jonah. If you come to
[31:45] our Wednesday night Bible studies, we've
[31:47] talked a little bit about this casting
[31:49] lots. This is the way that God had
[31:52] actually placed into the hands of people
[31:56] that they could. It's like flipping a
[31:58] coin
[32:00] and it would fall upon a certain one.
[32:03] And it's throughout the Bible and it was
[32:05] the way that God ordained back then that
[32:08] they could do this. And this lot fell
[32:10] upon this man Jonah. He is the one
[32:12] that's causing the problems.
[32:14] Then they said unto him, "Tell us, we
[32:17] pray thee, for whose cause this evil is
[32:19] upon us? What is thine occupation? And
[32:22] whence comest thou, and what is thy
[32:24] country, and of what people art thou?"
[32:27] And he said unto them,
[32:29] I'm a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the
[32:33] God of heaven, which hath made the sea
[32:36] and the dry land. Now he's saying he
[32:39] fears God, but just a little bit ago he
[32:43] was disobeying God and he was going to
[32:45] this Tarsus. But now he's fearing God.
[32:48] Why? Because the ship is sinking.
[32:51] Because his life is on the line. And now
[32:54] Jonah is saying now
[32:56] he gets his mind right. He says, "Now,
[32:58] okay, now I fear God." And he said unto
[33:01] them, "I'm a Hebrew and I fear God." And
[33:04] we see, friends, we see this happen a
[33:07] lot of times when something bad happens
[33:09] to us. As I said, when we go into trials
[33:12] and and tribulations, even though it's
[33:15] because of us,
[33:18] it's it's a blessing. A lot of people
[33:21] that go to prison, you see that they go
[33:23] to prison and they're they're living a
[33:26] sinful life outside of prison. Then they
[33:29] find the Lord Jesus in prison.
[33:32] I know a a a friend of mine that I was
[33:34] very close with,
[33:36] his name's Don.
[33:39] He could not really live outside of
[33:42] prison. He would get into all kinds of
[33:44] trouble, all kinds of crime, violent
[33:46] crime, but he would go into prison and
[33:48] then he would start reading books and he
[33:50] would start reading his Bible. He'd
[33:52] start praying more. He'd start a Bible
[33:53] study and he would do really well while
[33:55] inside. But when he would go out, he
[33:58] would immediately fall into sin. So I
[34:00] believe friends that we have a choice in
[34:02] our destination.
[34:04] We have I believe that the Bible teaches
[34:06] us that we have a choice but I also
[34:08] believe in predestination where God
[34:11] knows which choices that we are going to
[34:13] make and how we will make those choices
[34:15] and he will set a path in front of us
[34:17] like he did to Don or many others. He
[34:19] will set a path in front of us that
[34:21] forces us into him.
[34:25] And that's how this man Jonah was. Jonah
[34:28] was a son of God.
[34:30] great man who was running from God. We
[34:34] don't see him praying about going to
[34:36] Tarsus. We see him making that decision
[34:39] because it made sense in his mind. And
[34:42] that's the case for most people. They
[34:44] want to serve God as long as it makes
[34:47] sense to them. And even worse, most
[34:50] people want to serve God as long as
[34:52] God's serving them.
[34:55] As long as they can call themselves a
[34:57] Christian,
[34:58] &gt;&gt; they will serve God. As long as you you
[35:00] don't have to give too much of your
[35:02] life,
[35:03] &gt;&gt; as long as you don't have to make too
[35:05] many sacrifices,
[35:07] then you'll serve you'll serve God. But
[35:09] when God starts to require more as he
[35:13] did with Jonah, it's so easy for people
[35:15] to say, "Yeah, you know, I'll just serve
[35:17] God in my own way."
[35:19] We don't serve God in our own way.
[35:23] If we truly want to serve God, we serve
[35:25] God in his way.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; We serve God in the way that he has set
[35:29] before us. And Jonah right before he was
[35:33] saying, "I'm going to serve God in my
[35:35] own way. I'm going to go to Tarsus. I
[35:37] don't want to go over here. Maybe I got
[35:38] something wrong. This isn't working.
[35:40] This doesn't make sense. I'm going to
[35:42] serve God in my own way, God." No. And
[35:45] if you are a predestinate predestinated
[35:49] son or daughter of God,
[35:51] he is going to force you into that.
[35:55] Whether you have to go to prison,
[35:56] whether you have to make big mistakes,
[35:57] whether you have to cause all kinds of
[35:59] problems, God is going to force us in.
[36:02] We can make it a lot easier on ourselves
[36:04] if we just follow his leadings. Are you
[36:06] Are you with me?
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Jonah, he's serving God on his own
[36:11] terms. The people of Nineveh, as I said,
[36:14] they're Gentiles. They're sinners. They
[36:17] were not God's people, as he thought.
[36:21] And he may have prayed,
[36:25] but as I said with my friend,
[36:29] we don't want to pray in a way that
[36:31] says, "God, here is what should be."
[36:35] We say, "God, what do you want? Lord,
[36:38] what is your will in this
[36:40] sin?
[36:42] this man Jonah. So, he's on this ship
[36:44] and this this big storm comes
[36:48] and these people are like, "What is
[36:50] going on? This is not normal." And Jonah
[36:53] basically confesses to him and says,
[36:55] "Yeah, I'm the one that did this."
[36:59] And do you see how the sins of all of
[37:01] us, they don't just affect us.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Remember, I say it all the time. It's
[37:07] not just about you.
[37:09] You know, you you say, "Well, it's my
[37:11] life and I'm going to live how I want
[37:12] and I can make these decisions because
[37:14] it's me." No. Your decisions not only
[37:17] affect you, but they affect everyone
[37:18] around you. Jonah's bad decision here
[37:22] affected the people on this ship, and
[37:25] they were going to die because Jonah
[37:27] sinned.
[37:29] So, when we are are going before the
[37:32] Lord, and we might say, "Well, it's my
[37:35] body, it's myself, it's me, I can do
[37:37] what I want." No, you can't. Your life
[37:39] is not your own
[37:41] &gt;&gt; because you affect not only yourself and
[37:43] God wants you to be saved and God wants
[37:45] you to prosper, but you affect everyone
[37:47] around you.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; That's that's the even even last night
[37:51] when I sent out the prayer request.
[37:54] I got the sister Angela and brother
[37:57] Jeremy sent me the update on sister
[37:59] Ronnie. Serious situation.
[38:02] First thing I did, I sat back in my
[38:04] chair. I was I had my Bible open. I was
[38:06] I was studying.
[38:09] The first thing I did is I said, "Lord,
[38:12] am I in a place that I can approach you?
[38:15] Am I in a place that I can pray?" And as
[38:18] I sent out the request to to all of you
[38:21] all,
[38:23] the thought also came to my mind, are
[38:25] they in a place
[38:27] where they can get this prayer request
[38:30] and go before the Lord for this sister?
[38:34] And friends, if if you're sinning, if
[38:38] you're not in a place where God can use
[38:41] you or God will hear your prayer, who
[38:44] suffers? It's not just you. It would be
[38:46] the sister that needs our prayers right
[38:48] now.
[38:50] We owe it to each other.
[38:53] I talk a lot about Jesus and how he
[38:55] wanted unity because there is strength
[38:58] in unity.
[39:00] If we are together, if we are if we are
[39:02] worshiping together, if we love one
[39:04] another, it not only helps us, but it
[39:07] helps the people that need it. Paul said
[39:10] in I believe it was 1 Corinthians
[39:11] chapter 12.
[39:15] He said,
[39:17] Paul said, I don't I don't know exactly
[39:19] where it was. Paul said that those of us
[39:22] that are strong
[39:24] should bear the infirmities of those
[39:26] that are weak.
[39:28] 1 Corinthians 12 26 he says that when
[39:32] one member of the body suffers the
[39:35] entire body suffers and I'll tell you
[39:39] when one member of the body sins when
[39:42] one member of the body isn't living
[39:44] right it's not just that person
[39:48] it's all of us that suffer and here is
[39:52] Jonah
[39:54] and he is sinning and he's outside of
[39:56] the will of God And look who's
[39:58] suffering. It wasn't just him. It was
[40:00] all these people that had never heard of
[40:02] him before. And they were probably
[40:04] looking at him like, "What's the matter
[40:06] with you, man? Why did you do this? Now
[40:08] we're we got families to go home to. Why
[40:10] did you do this?" And Jonah then finally
[40:14] Jonah repents.
[40:17] And watch what happens.
[40:21] Verse number 10. Then were the men
[40:23] exceeding afraid and said unto him,"Wh
[40:26] hast thou done this?" For the men knew
[40:28] that he had fled from the presence of
[40:29] the Lord, because he had told them.
[40:37] Then they said unto him, "What shall we
[40:40] do unto thee that the sea might be calm
[40:43] unto us? For the sea rot and was
[40:46] tempestuous." And he said unto them,
[40:48] "Take me up and cast me forth into the
[40:51] sea." So shall the sea be calm unto you.
[40:54] For I know that for my sake this great
[40:56] tempest is upon you.
[40:59] So he acknowledges that his sins has
[41:02] caused problems to everyone around him.
[41:04] He confesses, he repents, and now Jonah
[41:08] is ready to surrender to God.
[41:11] So much so that he is giving his life
[41:15] for the pagans that were on that boat.
[41:18] He's like, "Throw me over." He didn't
[41:20] know what was going to happen. Jonah
[41:21] didn't know that a big whale was going
[41:23] to open his mouth and and swallow him.
[41:26] Jonah, now these pagans that he hated,
[41:30] Jonah's now like, "Hey, throw me over
[41:31] and you'll be saved." Look at the
[41:34] difference in Jonah.
[41:38] We're about to see
[41:40] Jonah go to prayer.
[41:43] Nevertheless, the men rode hard. They
[41:45] didn't want to throw him overboard. They
[41:47] didn't want this guy to die.
[41:48] Nevertheless, the men rode hard to bring
[41:50] to the land, but they could not, for the
[41:52] sea rot and was tempestuous against
[41:54] them. Wherefore they cried unto the Lord
[41:57] and said, "We beseech thee, oh Lord, we
[41:59] beseech thee, let us not perish, for
[42:01] this man's life, and lay not upon us the
[42:04] innocent blood, for thou hast for, oh
[42:08] Lord, hast hast done as it pleased
[42:11] thee." All of a sudden, now look at what
[42:14] has happened to these men.
[42:16] Instead of every man going to his own
[42:18] God and setting up their idol,
[42:23] this is a good idol. Setting up their
[42:25] idol and praying to this.
[42:30] Now they are going to the one true God.
[42:34] Look what happens when Jonah repents.
[42:37] Jonah says it's my fault. A repentance
[42:39] doesn't just affect us. A repentance is
[42:42] also a blessing to all those around us.
[42:44] And here Jonah is like, "I repent. I'm
[42:46] wrong. Throw me overboard. I give my
[42:49] life for you.
[42:51] Even though you're a pagan, even though
[42:52] you're not like me, even though you
[42:53] don't go to my church, I give my life
[42:56] for you." And look at the effect that it
[42:58] has on these men. Now, they're praying
[42:59] to the one true God.
[43:05] Remember the famous scripture, Romans
[43:07] 8:28.
[43:09] We know that all things work together
[43:10] for the good to them that love God and
[43:12] them that are called according to his
[43:13] purpose.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Look at Jonah completely out of the will
[43:17] of God, running from God, thinking
[43:21] laying leaning on his own understanding.
[43:24] And now he goes and now God is punishing
[43:27] and God brings the the tempest. God
[43:29] brings the the storm and the place is
[43:32] going to sink and they're all going to
[43:33] die. And now God uses that for the good.
[43:37] Now, it's even better probably than if
[43:39] Jonah would not have just gone to
[43:42] Nineveh in the first place. So, when we
[43:44] sin, friends, when you do something
[43:46] wrong, don't just crawl up in your hole
[43:48] and die. Say, "No, now I'm going to make
[43:51] it right. And Lord, no matter how bad
[43:53] that I have done, you can take whatever
[43:55] I've done and you can turn it around and
[43:57] you can make it a blessing, not only to
[43:58] me, but to others."
[44:00] I'm running out of time. So, they took
[44:03] up Jonah and cast him forth into the
[44:05] sea. And the sea ceased from her raging.
[44:08] Then the mere the men feared the Lord
[44:10] exceedingly. They feared God, not their
[44:12] go, not their idols. They fear the they
[44:15] feared the real God. Then the men feared
[44:18] the Lord exceedingly and offered a
[44:20] sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows.
[44:24] Look at the effect that it had on these
[44:26] men. So if we make mistakes, if we are a
[44:30] child of God, God turns around and makes
[44:32] those mistakes a blessing. Don't use it
[44:35] as an excuse to sin.
[44:38] You'll suffer for your sins as Jonah
[44:39] did. But when we make a mistake, watch
[44:43] God turn things around. Now the Lord had
[44:46] prepared a great fish to swallow up
[44:47] Jonah. And Jonah was Jonah was in the
[44:50] belly of the fish three days and three
[44:53] nights. Remember
[44:56] that for when I close. It's an important
[44:59] blessing that comes from this story and
[45:03] it's amazing.
[45:06] Watch what happens.
[45:08] Chapter 2 verse one. Then Jonah prayed
[45:11] unto the Lord his God out of the fish's
[45:13] belly.
[45:16] His prayers may not have been sincere
[45:18] before, but now he's at the bottom of
[45:20] the ocean in a whale's belly with no
[45:23] hope of redemption. No hope anywhere.
[45:26] And he's thinking about these things.
[45:27] So, no matter how far we've gone, God is
[45:30] able to turn things around. I don't
[45:32] think there's anyone in this room that
[45:35] have been so bad that they've been in a
[45:37] whale's stomach with seaweed around
[45:39] their neck at the thousand feet below
[45:42] the the the top and sitting there. I
[45:46] don't think anybody's done that bad. I
[45:48] don't think any situation has been that
[45:50] dire as it was with Jonah. But God can
[45:53] take that situation and turn it around.
[45:57] Now, when we have no hope
[46:00] and you think that the enemy and he
[46:03] tells us there's no hope in this
[46:04] situation, there's always hope in
[46:07] prayer. And watch what Jonah does. This
[46:10] is amazing. Now, we're going to hear
[46:12] from Jonah what he says.
[46:15] Jonah said this.
[46:17] I cried by reason of mine affliction
[46:21] unto the Lord, and he heard me.
[46:24] Out of the belly of hell cried I, and
[46:28] thou hast heard, thou hearest heardest
[46:31] my voice. For thou hast cast me into the
[46:35] deep, into the midst of the seas, and
[46:36] the floods compassed me about. All thy
[46:39] billows, and all thy waves passed over
[46:42] me. Then I said, I am cast out of thy
[46:45] sight. Yet I will look again toward thy
[46:48] holy temple. The waters comp compassed
[46:51] about me. Even to the soul the depth
[46:54] closed round about me. The weeds were
[46:56] wrapped around my head. wrapped about my
[46:59] head. I went down to the bottoms of the
[47:01] mountains. The earth with her bars was
[47:04] about me for forever. Yet hast thou
[47:08] brought up my life from corruption.
[47:12] Oh Lord my God. How many here can say
[47:15] the same?
[47:17] How many here can say the Lord has
[47:20] brought my life out of corruption?
[47:24] When my soul fainted within me, I
[47:26] remembered the Lord and my prayer came
[47:28] in unto thee into thine holy temple.
[47:32] They that observed they that observe
[47:34] lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
[47:38] So he's saying here that no matter how
[47:39] bad things appear, don't give up. when
[47:44] you lose all hope all hope when when you
[47:46] forsake the mercies of God that's when
[47:51] all hope is gone and a lot of times many
[47:54] times
[47:56] someone that commits a su suicide that's
[47:58] the number one thing is they just have
[48:00] no hope they think there's no one that
[48:02] can bring me out there's no way I can
[48:04] get past this you lose all hope and when
[48:08] you lose hope friends then things are
[48:11] really really bad, but you've never been
[48:14] in a situation like Jonah was right
[48:16] here. And yet, he still had hope in his
[48:19] prayer.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Read it again. But I will sacrifice unto
[48:24] thee with the voice of thanksgiving.
[48:27] I will pay that I have vowed. Salvation
[48:31] is of the Lord. He's repenting here.
[48:34] He's saying, "Lord, I'll do whatever it
[48:36] takes to make it right. I'll sacrifice
[48:39] to thee with a voice of thanksgiving.
[48:40] I'm not going to complain about
[48:41] anything, Lord. I'm going to I'm going
[48:42] to lift up my offering. I will pay that
[48:45] which I have vowed sal but salvation
[48:48] Lord is from you.
[48:50] And the Lord spake unto the fish and it
[48:53] vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
[48:59] So out of nowhere the worst you have
[49:01] this weward prophet
[49:04] and he goes and
[49:06] everyone suffers because of what he did.
[49:10] And then yet God turns this around. He
[49:13] turns his life around. And then he makes
[49:16] it a blessing. So much so that the
[49:19] people even on the ship, the pagans, the
[49:21] unbelievers, even they saw the power of
[49:24] God. And even they made sacrifices to
[49:28] the Lord. And Jonah goes
[49:31] preaches in Nineveh
[49:34] and they repent.
[49:36] And it's tremendous story of
[49:39] disobedience, tremendous story of prayer
[49:42] and how God we should never lose hope
[49:45] that God is always there to hear our
[49:48] prayer. Now remember I said that
[49:53] God can take a mistake a dire mistake
[49:57] that we make an embarrassing mistake
[50:00] maybe something that we just Lord I
[50:02] can't believe I did it. I I I did I did
[50:05] this so wrong.
[50:08] And God can take that mistake if we
[50:11] repent. And he can turn it around to
[50:14] make it more of a blessing than if we
[50:18] would have never done it.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And that's what happened with Jonah. Now
[50:23] watch this.
[50:27] Jesus
[50:29] in Matthew chapter 12, the Pharisees and
[50:32] the Sadducees asked Jesus to show them a
[50:35] sign. Jesus was always chiding back and
[50:38] forth with him. You know, same thing
[50:40] with just like Jonah, they wanted Jesus
[50:43] to fall in line to preached, but Jesus
[50:47] wouldn't do it. So, they say, "Okay,
[50:50] well, show us a sign, you know, then
[50:53] then we'll believe you." Matthew 12:38,
[50:56] listen to this. Then certain of the
[50:58] scribes and Pharisees answering, saying,
[51:00] "Master, we would see a sign from thee."
[51:02] But he answered and said unto them, "An
[51:04] evil and adulterous generation seeks
[51:06] after a sign, and there shall no sign be
[51:09] given it, but the sign of the prophet
[51:12] Jonas.
[51:14] For as Jonas was three days and three
[51:18] nights in the whale's belly, so shall
[51:20] the Son of Man be three days and three
[51:23] nights in the heart of the earth. The
[51:26] men of Nineveh shall shall rise in
[51:28] judgment with this generation. These are
[51:31] the people that Jonah preached to.
[51:34] The men of Nineveh shall rise in
[51:35] judgment to this generation and shall
[51:38] condemn it because they repented at the
[51:41] preaching of Jonas. And behold, a
[51:44] greater than Jonas is here.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Speaking of himself,
[51:50] how beautiful. Jesus wasn't remembering.
[51:52] Josiah and the worship team can come in
[51:55] closing. Jesus was not remembering the
[51:58] mistakes of Jonah.
[52:02] Really, it's in the sea of God's
[52:03] forgetfulness.
[52:06] And he doesn't remember our mistakes
[52:07] either. But he can take that mistake and
[52:11] make it a prophecy from the death,
[52:14] burial, and resurrection of Jesus
[52:17] Christ, our savior, through Jonah's
[52:19] mistake.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous story this is. Jonah
[52:24] does all of these things wrong and yet
[52:26] God turns it around and says, "It's just
[52:28] like my son's going to be in the grave
[52:31] for three days and he's going to raise
[52:34] up again just as Jonah came out of the
[52:35] whale.
[52:39] again, Matthew. And then he goes and he
[52:41] repeats it. Matthew 16 verse1,
[52:44] I'm sorry, Matthew 16:4.
[52:47] A wicked and adulter adulterous
[52:49] generation seeks after a sign. And there
[52:52] shall be no sign given unto it, but the
[52:54] sign of the prophet Jonas.
[52:57] And he left them and departed.
[53:00] Jonah would have done better for himself
[53:02] to set aside his way of thinking and
[53:04] follow the leading of the Lord.
[53:06] But he did what all of us do. He put
[53:10] himself there. He put his understanding
[53:13] there. This makes sense. Why would God
[53:16] want this? This is how it should be.
[53:20] Proverbs 3:5 says, "Trust not trust the
[53:23] Lord with all of your heart and lean not
[53:25] to your own understanding. In all your
[53:27] ways, submit to him and he will make
[53:30] your path straight."
[53:33] It's the hardest thing, friends.
[53:35] This is the hardest thing in the world
[53:38] is for us to lay aside our own way of
[53:40] thinking. Lay aside really our own
[53:44] religion,
[53:46] which is what required Jo Jonah had to
[53:48] do. Lay aside those things and seek God.
[53:54] Pray to God. Lord, how do you want to
[53:58] handle this situation? Husband and a
[54:00] wife. My friend was praying about
[54:03] homeschooling.
[54:04] They should have got together
[54:07] and prayed, "Lord, we want to do what's
[54:09] right. Let us just surrender ourselves
[54:11] to you as Jonah did on the ship when it
[54:14] was a dire need. Lord, let us just have
[54:17] your will. Let us do your will."
[54:21] And then we can rest assured that no
[54:24] matter how how many mistakes we make, no
[54:27] matter how bad things get, no matter how
[54:31] hopeless things seem,
[54:34] that God will hear our prayers
[54:37] and he will take these things and make
[54:40] it a blessing to others. And it may be
[54:43] that we're all in this ship and there
[54:46] may be
[54:48] some Jonases among us,
[54:51] but friends, if we could just
[54:54] surrender,
[54:56] then it'll be a blessing to the whole
[54:57] ship. Amen. Little Josiah.
[55:07] Let's sing in his time.
[55:11] In his time.
[55:18] In his time
[55:24] he makes all things
[55:28] beautiful
[55:30] in his time.
[55:34] [Music]
[55:36] Lord, please show me every day
[55:42] as you're teaching me your way
[55:48] that you do just what you say
[55:54] in your time.
[55:57] [Music]
[56:00] Yes. In his time.
[56:06] In his time.
[56:11] He makes all things
[56:15] beautiful
[56:17] in his time.
[56:23] Lord, please show me every day
[56:29] as you're teaching
[56:32] me your way
[56:35] that you do just what you say
[56:41] in your time.
[56:44] In your time.
[56:47] In your time.
[56:53] In your time
[56:58] you make all things
[57:02] beautiful
[57:04] in your time.
[57:08] [Music]
[57:10] Lord, my life to you I bring.
[57:16] Each song I have to sing
[57:22] be to you a lovely thing
[57:27] in your Let's sing that again. Let's
[57:29] stand together.
[57:33] In your time.
[57:38] In your time.
[57:44] You make all things
[57:48] beautiful
[57:50] in your time.
[57:53] [Music]
[57:56] Lord, my life to you I bring.
[58:01] May each song to you I sing.
[58:07] be to you a lovely thing
[58:13] in your time.
[58:16] [Music]
[58:18] Remember brothers and sisters,
[58:21] this life
[58:23] is not of all about you.
[58:26] And every decision that you make, it
[58:29] doesn't just affect you. It affects
[58:31] everyone around you. And it you can
[58:35] either have a positive influence
[58:38] and do great good or you can have a
[58:41] negative influence and do great harm.
[58:45] And it's dependent on what you say. It's
[58:47] dependent on what you do. It's depend
[58:48] dependent on the decisions that you
[58:50] make. If you can get yourself out of the
[58:53] way and truly come into the presence of
[58:56] God like Jonah did in the belly of the
[58:59] whale,
[59:01] coming into the presence of God
[59:04] and truly repenting and truly saying,
[59:09] "Lord,
[59:11] you are
[59:13] you are great. You are everything." Let
[59:15] me read again what Jonah said.
[59:20] I cried by reason of mine affliction
[59:23] unto the Lord and he heard me.
[59:28] Can you imagine? Can you really imagine
[59:30] if God hears?
[59:33] We take prayer for granted. It's just a
[59:35] few words
[59:37] in Jesus name. Amen. That's not prayer
[59:40] really. Enter. Enter into the presence
[59:43] of God. Enter into the presence of the
[59:46] creator. Enter into this presence of
[59:50] this one, this all knowing one that can
[59:54] do all things. Enter into his presence
[59:58] and then to say the same thing that
[1:00:01] Jonah said and he heard me. Can you
[1:00:05] imagine if he really hears
[1:00:09] a sincere prayer? Nothing could stand
[1:00:12] before our prayers. If we are truly in
[1:00:16] the presence of God, out of the belly of
[1:00:19] hell, cried I,
[1:00:23] and thou heardest my voice.
[1:00:26] For thou has cast me into the deep, into
[1:00:29] the midst of the seas, and the flood
[1:00:31] compass about me about. All thy billows,
[1:00:34] and thy waves passed over me. Then I
[1:00:38] said, I am cast out of thy sight.
[1:00:42] Yet I will look again toward thy holy
[1:00:44] temple. The waters compassed me about
[1:00:48] even to the soul. The depth closed me
[1:00:52] round about. The weeds were wrapped
[1:00:54] about my head.
[1:00:56] I went down to the bottoms of the
[1:00:59] mountains. The earth with her bars was
[1:01:02] about me forever. Yet hast thou brought
[1:01:05] up my life from corruption.
[1:01:08] Oh Lord my God.
[1:01:11] When my soul faintth within me, I
[1:01:13] remember the Lord, and my prayer came in
[1:01:16] unto thee into thine holy temple. They
[1:01:20] that observe lying vanities forsake
[1:01:22] their own mercy, but I will sacrifice
[1:01:25] unto thee with the voice of
[1:01:27] thanksgiving. That can be our sacrifice.
[1:01:31] Lord, I give to you my voice. I give to
[1:01:34] you my prayers. I give to you my thanks.
[1:01:36] I give to you, Lord. This is my
[1:01:39] sacrifice that I say thank you, oh God.
[1:01:44] I will sacrifice
[1:01:46] unto thee with the voice of
[1:01:47] thanksgiving. I will pay that that I
[1:01:51] have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord.
[1:01:56] And then the Lord spake to the fish
[1:01:58] and Jonah was delivered.
[1:02:01] Can you imagine friends actually
[1:02:03] speaking to that one?
[1:02:08] When we come into his presence, come
[1:02:11] reverently.
[1:02:13] He's not your buddy.
[1:02:16] He is someone
[1:02:18] that deserves our reverence and deserves
[1:02:22] everything that we can give him. Lord, I
[1:02:25] come to you in the name of your son
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ. I am a sinner. You are my
[1:02:32] savior. You are my creator. I come to
[1:02:34] you, Lord, and here
[1:02:37] is what I have need of.
[1:02:40] Lord, I pray that you would put me in
[1:02:42] your perfect will as you did Jonah.
[1:02:44] Let's bow our heads.
[1:02:48] Friends, think on these things.
[1:02:53] Think how all of us have been in Jonah's
[1:02:55] position
[1:02:58] that we've taken our own way. We've
[1:03:01] taken our own ideas
[1:03:04] and we've done nothing but suffer for
[1:03:05] them. But if we could just lay our lives
[1:03:10] before the Almighty
[1:03:12] in prayer as Jonah did,
[1:03:16] then we can trust in him
[1:03:18] that he will provide. He'll provide our
[1:03:20] families.
[1:03:22] He'll forgive our sins.
[1:03:26] He'll provide fellowship.
[1:03:28] He'll provide a husband. He'll provide a
[1:03:30] wife. He'll provide children
[1:03:33] if we could just get ourselves out of
[1:03:35] the way and truly approach him.
[1:03:38] Lord God,
[1:03:41] [Music]
[1:03:42] Lord, the thought is overwhelming
[1:03:47] that we can come into the presence of
[1:03:48] the almighty God.
[1:03:52] Lord, it is written in your word,
[1:03:56] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[1:03:57] name, there I will be in the midst of
[1:04:01] them.
[1:04:03] Lord,
[1:04:05] the best that we can, we gather here
[1:04:07] this morning in the name of Jesus
[1:04:09] Christ.
[1:04:11] And Lord, lay our lives down before you
[1:04:15] might, Father, serve you
[1:04:19] from this day forward that we might have
[1:04:21] a change in our lives and and serve,
[1:04:24] Father, you serve your people.
[1:04:27] And may the influence that's given to
[1:04:30] each of us that each of us have, Father,

[1:05:00] your love.

[1:05:06] say what Jonah said
[1:05:09] that we cried to the Lord and he heard.
[1:05:14] Dear God, may it be so.
[1:05:16] We love you in Jesus name.
