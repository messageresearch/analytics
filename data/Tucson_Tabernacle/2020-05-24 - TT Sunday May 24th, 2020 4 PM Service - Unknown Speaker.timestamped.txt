[35:51] ago so our flight unfortunately because
[35:55] of the kovat 19 we couldn't as we said
[35:58] this morning we couldn't get into Tucson
[35:59] so we had to go to Phoenix and then
[36:01] there was only one flight and it was
[36:03] really early in the morning so I've got
[36:05] to be at the airport about 5:00 a.m. so
[36:08] I debated actually planned on when asked
[36:10] by the law I would just go after this
[36:12] lunch today I'd go back to Phoenix and
[36:15] try to get some rest I thought I want to
[36:18] be there I want to hear it allow want to
[36:19] be able to take part so I thought well
[36:21] I'll just maybe move the service up so I
[36:24] hope this was okay so you did it for me
[36:27] and I appreciate that amen and I just
[36:29] wanted to take part
[36:30] I love worshiping the Lord I can't I'd
[36:34] rather be a Christian than anything I
[36:36] know Amen I'd rather be a church than
[36:38] anywhere I'd that I could think of I
[36:41] just love coming to church love coming
[36:43] to the house of God amen and just
[36:45] hearing the word of God did you come
[36:47] with an expectation you see Jesus is the
[36:51] shepherd he's the one who feeds us and
[36:53] he never disappoints he never lets you
[36:57] down you never leave you never leave
[36:59] hungry you always leave filled Amen so
[37:02] you just put your trust in him tonight
[37:03] take that need maybe something you have
[37:06] Amen upon your heart raise it up to the
[37:08] Lord say Lord Jesus go ahead if you got
[37:10] a need here tonight say Lord here's my
[37:12] need amen I'm gonna I'm gonna represent
[37:14] it by a hand and then I'm gonna put
[37:16] faith that you've called a brother and
[37:18] you're gonna use the office of ministry
[37:21] and you're gonna speak to my need amen I
[37:23] believe God can do that Lord willing
[37:25] we're trying to still make some plans
[37:27] here for coming back and I'm not sure if
[37:31] it'll be this week or the following what
[37:33] Lord willin looks like we'll be driving
[37:35] out and I'll have the whole family with
[37:37] me so I'll be I'll be really thankful
[37:39] for that amen so I'll be looking forward
[37:42] to that and also we'd like to just say
[37:45] one more thing concerning what we spoke
[37:46] about today I got a just a few more
[37:48] comments concerning it that uh you know
[37:52] we're not dogmatic about anything that
[37:54] we're doing with these are guidelines
[37:56] and recommendations and I think a
[37:58] guideline is something that we really
[38:00] are asking for your help with and then I
[38:03] recommend it would just be left up to
[38:06] you so so just continue to serve the
[38:09] Lord amen and then we'll see what
[38:12] happens for next weekend and then
[38:13] Wednesday night everything will be
[38:15] obviously we're gonna continue as we
[38:17] were today in the same guidelines and
[38:19] parameters that we set forth so we
[38:21] appreciate amen your cooperation with
[38:24] that I think there was a little bit of a
[38:26] question at the end that I probably
[38:29] blush was my fault with dismissal we had
[38:32] mentioned the Deacons will dismiss row
[38:33] by row but you know not everyone wants
[38:36] to dismiss missed and so I appreciate
[38:40] that I love lingering and worshiping the
[38:43] Lord and I believe everybody should be
[38:44] free to go when you want to go when you
[38:47] feel to go amen so when you feel to
[38:49] leave you can do that we're just trying
[38:51] to prevent a herd from going out
[38:54] you love you love the Lord amen I know
[38:58] that I do
[38:59] amen let's sing some we were singing
[39:01] this morning nobody loves me like you
[39:03] meet Jesus
[39:05] as we invited by the loudest look to the
[39:07] Lord now morning I see you in the
[39:14] sunrise every morn
[39:19] it's like a picture that you painted for
[39:26] love letter in the sky
[39:33] story sing it now store I could have had
[39:41] a really different store but you came
[39:47] down from heaven to restore
[39:53] forever forever sing
[40:01] raise your hands and singing down nobody
[40:05] loves me like you love me Jesus not
[40:11] standing no way I worship you as long as
[40:20] I am breathing God you are faithful and
[40:26] true nobody loves me like
[40:33] Mountains you're breaking down or
[40:37] mountains you're breaking down the way
[40:41] to pull my man
[40:46] even when it looks like I'm surrounded
[40:52] will you never leave my side
[40:59] Oh nobody loves me like you love me
[41:06] thank you Lord for that and not standing
[41:10] no and you
[41:12] [Music]
[41:22] God you are faithful and he loves me
[41:27] like is that true for you tonight it's
[41:33] certainly true for me I'm assuming this
[41:35] is working so that's always a good thing
[41:38] I was really encouraged this morning and
[41:42] really blessed by the message from
[41:44] brother Matt and in my case I was
[41:47] especially blessed because I
[41:48] I thought he'd taken a peek at some of
[41:50] my notes so that just served as a sort
[41:54] of a confirmation for me and I know I
[41:58] didn't read his it's hard it's hard to
[42:03] express how happy I am to be able to
[42:07] fellowship with my family in Christ my
[42:10] brothers and sisters each one of you and
[42:13] thinking about that I thought if I can
[42:17] remember how to do this because it's
[42:18] been a while
[42:26] we've got two pages up there how did
[42:28] that happen well we've got two pages up
[42:38] there I'd like us to sing together the
[42:43] family of God I'm so glad I'm a part of
[42:54] the family of God
[42:58] I've been washed in the fountain
[43:03] cleansed by his blood joint heirs with
[43:10] Jesus as we travel this sod for I'm part
[43:17] of the family the family of God I
[43:25] apologize let's try it again and maybe
[43:29] I'll forget you know that the keys are
[43:31] really wide and the space is really
[43:33] narrow when you're a musician but when
[43:35] you're up here the spaces are really
[43:36] wide and the keys are really hard to
[43:38] find
[43:39] [Music]
[43:48] of God I've been washed in the fountain
[43:56] when spice one
[44:01] joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this
[44:11] part of the family the family are
[44:21] thank you very much and I just want to
[44:25] thank our musicians I want to thank
[44:26] sister Juliana and sister Angela thank
[44:29] you you you you probably don't realize
[44:32] the blessing that it's been when we've
[44:33] been sequestered in our homes to be able
[44:35] to have the streaming the effort the
[44:37] people brother Jordan and others that
[44:39] have made so much effort to bring that
[44:41] to us and the blessing that it's been to
[44:43] be able to just enter in to enter into
[44:46] worship to enter into fellowship and and
[44:50] just be a part of what's going on even
[44:53] though we're physically separated
[44:54] there's no distance in Christ there's no
[44:56] distance in the Lord
[44:57] I should also probably say that it's a
[45:02] little hard to express how surprised I
[45:04] am to be here this evening I've got a
[45:07] phone call from brother Matt late
[45:08] they pastor Matthew late Friday morning
[45:12] and I wasn't home at the time that you
[45:15] can be sure I hurried home I didn't
[45:17] exceed the speed limit by much and if
[45:23] it's okay I know you're still standing
[45:25] it's okay because this is honoring the
[45:26] Lord and only to sit in a minute but but
[45:28] I just like to share a little testimony
[45:30] with you you you all know the story
[45:32] about back and Thanksgiving of 2017 when
[45:34] I had the heart attack and got rushed
[45:36] into the ER and they weren't expecting
[45:38] me and yet within a few minutes they if
[45:41] a stet because I had 100% blockage on
[45:43] the right side of the heart and I was
[45:45] running at about two-thirds of a heart
[45:47] for quite a while until April of 2018
[45:51] when in one of the at Wednesday evening
[45:53] services here not a special prayer line
[45:55] not anything like I just worshiping in
[45:57] the Lord and the Lord just made it very
[46:00] clear that he wanted you to worship Him
[46:02] well sure
[46:03] so but I noticed you know up until that
[46:06] time when we have song service after
[46:09] about 15 minutes I was just mouthing the
[46:12] words because I couldn't do it that
[46:15] Sunday morning Heather looked at me
[46:18] because I kept singing through the whole
[46:20] thing and I'm sure the people near me a
[46:22] next service at a little further away
[46:23] but but but but the Lord had touched me
[46:27] in that Tuesday that very week I went
[46:30] and it had an echocardiogram and
[46:31] the cardiologist said I can't tell any
[46:34] difference between your heart and a
[46:36] normal healthy heart thank the Lord
[46:39] well two years later Tuesday this last
[46:42] week Tuesday I went to the cardiologist
[46:45] again it was a different doctor this
[46:47] time but the same office and I did the
[46:49] echocardiogram and and she looked
[46:51] through all of this stuff and she came
[46:53] in and she said well you had this heart
[46:55] attack and you have this blockage here
[46:57] and that's now but but your hearts your
[47:00] heart is undamaged and I thought thank
[47:03] you look it's just like justification as
[47:05] if it had never happened I was just so
[47:08] grateful for that so I wanted to share
[47:10] that testimony of the Lord that it was
[47:11] two years ago that he touched my heart
[47:13] and it's just as touch now as it was
[47:15] then now you may have noticed some of
[47:19] you may have noticed that I'm not
[47:20] wearing my brown suit I'm wearing my
[47:22] birthday suit I wait that didn't come
[47:25] out right
[47:26] I wearing a suit that I got for my
[47:29] birthday that my my niece occupied
[47:31] Cavanaugh had had sent me and for my
[47:33] 70th birthday and so I'm wearing it
[47:36] tonight and if if she hears this or
[47:38] listen to whatever I want her to know
[47:39] that that that I'm wearing that someday
[47:42] someday we will all get a new birthday
[47:44] suit when we have that change in the
[47:45] body but but right now we'll just have
[47:47] to cover up the one that we've got and
[47:50] then of course finally finally I want to
[47:54] express the weight that I feel of
[47:55] responsibility of speaking to you
[47:58] fire that the Lord speak and continue
[48:01] what happened this morning
[48:03] and so if you join me in prayer before
[48:05] we read description Lord Jesus we are in
[48:08] all of you we are so grateful for your
[48:11] grace your love your mercy your kindness
[48:13] your long-suffering everything Lord that
[48:15] you do and continue to do for us and in
[48:18] spite of us Lord Lord I pray that you
[48:21] would just get Lyle Johnson out of the
[48:23] way Lord people didn't come here to hear
[48:25] Lyle Johnson they came to hear from
[48:26] Jesus Christ lord please please we thank
[48:30] you because we believe Lord we've come
[48:32] expecting you to move in our midst Lord
[48:34] and Lord we're we're just we're an
[48:36] anticipation of what you have for us we
[48:38] thank you forgive us Lord where we fall
[48:41] short and help us to to reflect and
[48:43] please you we ask in Jesus name Amen
[48:46] okay while we're standing yep please
[48:50] turn with me in your Bible if you will
[48:51] to Hebrews 11 it will just read the
[48:57] first four verses of this and then and
[48:59] then you can be seated Paul says here
[49:03] now faith Paul is going to do something
[49:06] for she's going to define faith for us
[49:09] faith is the substance of things hoped
[49:13] for it's the evidence of things not seen
[49:17] now that to see is to understand so this
[49:21] verse isn't talking about invisible
[49:23] things physically invisible the topic is
[49:26] defining faith faith gives substance to
[49:30] her hopes and it's presence is the
[49:34] evidence of our acceptance of things we
[49:37] may not fully understand or comprehend
[49:39] we can't quite see it but yet we know
[49:42] it's there for by it but by what by
[49:47] faith the elders who are the elders
[49:50] which elders
[49:52] before those who have gone on before
[49:55] obtained a good report and Paul will
[49:58] share a little bit of that report with
[49:59] us it's through faith whose faith Paul's
[50:04] brother branham's as brother Aaron keeps
[50:07] telling us put your name there through
[50:10] faith put your name there Lyle Johnson
[50:13] understands that the worlds were framed
[50:15] by the Word of God so that things which
[50:18] are seen we're talking about physical
[50:20] now things which are seen were not made
[50:23] by things which do appear God did not
[50:26] use an erector set or Lego blocks by
[50:30] faith this was the substance of his hope
[50:33] by faith the evidence of something that
[50:37] he maybe didn't fully understand Abel
[50:40] offered unto God a more excellent
[50:43] sacrifice than Cain case may have been
[50:46] excellent James may have been excellent
[50:49] but Abel's was more excellent an and by
[50:53] which but by what by the sacrifice was
[50:56] it really the sacrifice but was it the
[50:58] faith behind the sacrifice that he able
[51:02] Abel obtained witness that he that Abel
[51:06] was righteous well who gave that witness
[51:09] Paul tells us God testifying of his
[51:13] gifts you can't get it better or more
[51:15] important witness than God God
[51:20] testifying of his gifts and buy it buy
[51:24] it buy what his faith in God's testimony
[51:28] of his faith Abel being dead yet speaks
[51:32] being dead yet speaks present tense not
[51:36] being dead yet spoke speaks today today
[51:40] yet speaks okay I'm going to be reading
[51:44] a fairy but tonight please sit down
[51:49] righteousness by faith and when did that
[51:52] of righteousness by faith it was after
[51:56] he offered the sacrifice it wasn't
[51:59] during it wasn't before he didn't go to
[52:01] Ikea and follow a careful set of little
[52:04] cartoon
[52:04] directions of how to build an altar now
[52:06] to build a fire oh no no the listen it
[52:10] wasn't some complicated liturgy where
[52:12] you get a lantern and you put incense in
[52:15] it and you swing it three times and you
[52:17] say this particular phrase there was
[52:19] none of that he didn't know that he
[52:22] didn't know that but it was his faith
[52:24] expressed through the act of sacrifice
[52:27] that's what it was Paul continues
[52:31] listing some of that good report of the
[52:33] elders note if you've read it and I'm
[52:36] sure you have but that list isn't just
[52:39] preacher so-and-so and prophet so-and-so
[52:42] and judge so-and-so there's a lot of
[52:44] ladies that are mentioned in there too
[52:45] heroes of faith don't come in one
[52:48] particular sex well I'm gonna skip now
[52:51] to verse 32 Paul is still talking about
[52:56] these things now he says what more shall
[52:57] I say he's given us this list and some
[53:00] of those things in that list are pretty
[53:02] amazing when you think of well I don't
[53:05] want to go down that rabbit trail he
[53:07] says for the time would fail me to tell
[53:10] of gideon or baraka or samson or jeff
[53:15] jela and David also Samuel the prophets
[53:20] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[53:24] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[53:28] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[53:32] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[53:35] sword out of weakness were made strong
[53:38] waxed valiant in fight turned to flight
[53:42] the armies of the aliens women received
[53:46] their dead raised to life again
[53:47] we all like to read our victories we
[53:50] like to celebrate victories if you go to
[53:53] a look at ancient Egyptian texts and
[53:55] read the hieroglyphics or somebody that
[53:57] claims to read them to you you'll notice
[53:59] that the Egyptians never talked about a
[54:00] defeat you think that they never lost a
[54:02] battle or a war that's why you don't
[54:04] find any archaeological evidence in
[54:07] Egyptian stuff about Moses and the
[54:09] exodus because that was a defeat but I'm
[54:13] not talking about Egypt tonight it's ok
[54:15] get back on track I'll notice Paul is
[54:17] using
[54:18] characters not-not-not figments of
[54:21] people's imagination it's not from a
[54:23] from a Hollywood movie or from where
[54:25] they call it now a graphic novel a comic
[54:28] book it's not there's no superheroes
[54:30] involved here of the imagination these
[54:32] are real people who lived real lives
[54:34] that are recorded in part and what we
[54:37] call the old testament well let's
[54:40] continue on because there's the other
[54:42] side others were tortured not accepting
[54:46] deliverance that they might obtain a
[54:48] better resurrection others had trial of
[54:51] cruel mockings and scourgings a moreover
[54:56] of bonds and imprisonment I'm sure Paul
[54:59] could certainly relate to some of that
[55:01] even as he's writing this they were
[55:03] stoned they were sawn asunder
[55:07] they were tempted they were tested were
[55:11] slain with the sword they wandered about
[55:13] in sheepskins and goatskins being
[55:15] destitute afflicted tormented and Paul
[55:21] tells us of whom the world was not
[55:23] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[55:26] mountains and in dens and in caves of
[55:28] the earth and these all the victors and
[55:34] the ones that seemed like they might
[55:36] have been somewhat less victorious these
[55:38] all having obtained a good report whose
[55:41] filling out the report God through faith
[55:45] received not the promise the redemption
[55:50] of the body errors of the world they
[55:53] didn't receive that it wasn't yet that
[55:54] time it wasn't that season as we heard
[55:56] this morning to everything there's a
[55:58] time in his season God having provided
[56:00] some better thing for us what what what
[56:06] better thing what what better thing Paul
[56:09] tells us in Hebrews 719 the law made
[56:12] nothing perfect but the bringing in of a
[56:14] better hope did by the which we draw
[56:18] nigh unto God some better thing for us
[56:22] that they the elders those that have
[56:26] gone before they without us where's your
[56:29] name
[56:30] without brother Aaron they without Lyle
[56:34] Johnson they without you and you and you
[56:38] and you could not be made perfect
[56:42] the final perfection the immortal body
[56:45] and from this we can draw the conclusion
[56:47] that they with us put your name in there
[56:50] they with us will be made perfect they
[56:53] will be fully redeemed and so will we
[56:56] now not every victory is won that's easy
[57:00] to celebrate not everyone returns home
[57:04] from battle and those who do are rarely
[57:06] unscathed brother Branham talks about
[57:08] battle-scarred veterans in fact is
[57:10] pastor Matthews been reminding us it's
[57:12] through battles and trials and obstacles
[57:14] that we build character and see the hand
[57:17] of God in our lives our job is not to
[57:24] test the Lord our job is to trust the
[57:27] Lord while he tests us each church age
[57:31] passage and the book of the revelation
[57:33] of Jesus Christ is addressed to the ones
[57:36] who overcome all seven of those passages
[57:39] and with to him that overcometh to him
[57:41] that overcometh battle battle I'd like
[57:46] you if you have your Bible turn to the
[57:48] book of Job the nineteenth chapter we'll
[57:50] begin at the 25th verse now this is
[57:53] what's typically read at funerals and
[57:54] it's okay we're not going to be rolling
[57:56] a casket in here tonight here we go
[58:01] Joe for I I know and put your name there
[58:06] this isn't just reading about Jobe this
[58:09] is the Word of God to us for I Lyle
[58:11] Johnson I put in your name no there's no
[58:16] guesswork here isn't what we know I know
[58:19] that I love Heather I know that I know
[58:23] that Heather loves me there's no doubt
[58:27] there's no guesswork it's not hope it's
[58:30] certainty i know that my redeemer lyle
[58:35] johnson's redeemer your redeemer and by
[58:38] the way that redeemer is as we've been
[58:40] hearing from the book of ruth that
[58:41] redeemer has to be a kinsman
[58:44] has to be a kinsman either through
[58:45] marriage or through blood has to be a
[58:47] kinsman that Redeemer the only one that
[58:51] can redeem me lives I know that do you
[58:55] know that I know that that he lives and
[58:58] that he my Redeemer Jesus Christ shall
[59:01] stand at the latter day upon the earth
[59:05] it's gonna it's certainty and though
[59:10] after Lyle Johnston's put in your name
[59:13] skin worms destroy this body this
[59:16] birthday suits gone right after the skin
[59:19] worms destroy this body it's consumed
[59:21] it's kind you can't find a trace of it
[59:23] anywhere yet in my flesh shall Lyle
[59:29] Johnson see God put your name there you
[59:34] will whom I I will see for myself and
[59:39] mine your eyes shall behold and not
[59:43] another not another doesn't mean there
[59:45] won't be somebody else there too there's
[59:46] gonna be lots of us there but you're not
[59:48] gonna see eyes you're going to see it
[59:52] you're gonna witness it you're gonna be
[59:53] a part of it yourself
[59:57] so we see here regardless of the
[1:00:00] physical outcome regardless of one way
[1:00:03] or find the caught a way to be with the
[1:00:04] Lord even if we die before that time we
[1:00:08] will live to see that day and we will be
[1:00:12] perfected in Christ it's not that we
[1:00:15] hope we will I know my Redeemer liveth
[1:00:18] we will be perfected and not by
[1:00:21] ourselves not or just this generation or
[1:00:24] just his fellowship it's not just us
[1:00:27] no they without us implies it without
[1:00:30] them we wouldn't be made perfect either
[1:00:34] reaching back through the mists of time
[1:00:36] and forward to whatever time might
[1:00:38] remain for Humanity but it's right here
[1:00:42] right now we're in this together
[1:00:46] the body of Christ fitly joined together
[1:00:50] or in this together now when when pastor
[1:00:54] Matthew asked me about speaking this
[1:00:56] evening I thought well
[1:00:57] you know I've got there's a lot of
[1:00:59] topics I'd like to share with you
[1:01:01] there's there's a lot of things I said
[1:01:03] these last several weeks when we've been
[1:01:05] more sequestered than normal I've been
[1:01:09] taking into a lot of things one of the
[1:01:11] things that I did was I took an
[1:01:13] introductory course and Heather took it
[1:01:15] with me
[1:01:16] it was for non-scientists on modern
[1:01:18] physics about relativity and quantum
[1:01:20] mechanics okay you say you say yeah yeah
[1:01:24] well the parallels between that and the
[1:01:29] last future changes are astounding
[1:01:31] they're in lockstep talk about the
[1:01:33] natural being a type of the spiritual
[1:01:35] the natural universe modeling or giving
[1:01:37] us imperfect glimpses into the unseen
[1:01:40] spiritual world I I identified a little
[1:01:42] bit with that character that story
[1:01:44] character not a real character that
[1:01:46] brother branham talks about and several
[1:01:48] messages where there's this fellow and
[1:01:50] his daughter was gonna have the ladies
[1:01:52] with the church over for tea and this
[1:01:54] guy would just get excited about so if
[1:01:56] he be reading in the Bible and then he
[1:01:58] start stomping and jumping around and
[1:02:00] shouting and she wanted to keep him
[1:02:02] quiet so she she he agreed that he'd go
[1:02:04] up in the attic and she gave him a
[1:02:06] geography what could be more boring than
[1:02:08] a geography she gave him the geography I
[1:02:10] will keep him quiet he's upstairs
[1:02:13] they're having their tea things are
[1:02:15] going along and then suddenly hallelujah
[1:02:17] whoa Oh dad what is he doing
[1:02:21] runs upstairs and and and what is it dad
[1:02:24] what what did you find a Bible appear
[1:02:26] something what's going on
[1:02:27] no no I was reading into geography and I
[1:02:30] saw Europe and South America whatever
[1:02:31] but I got you a place where it said
[1:02:33] there's places in the ocean that as of
[1:02:36] the time this geography was written they
[1:02:38] hadn't found the bottom of yet and I
[1:02:40] thought
[1:02:40] praise God my Caesar throne my sins are
[1:02:43] thrown into the sea and I just couldn't
[1:02:46] contain myself
[1:02:47] okay so so what happened so he was
[1:02:51] excited about the geography well I got
[1:02:53] pretty excited about some of this
[1:02:54] physics stuff I have to admit well I we
[1:02:58] also have been digging into some of the
[1:03:00] history of ancient Egypt archaeology the
[1:03:03] eastern Mediterranean seeing how it ties
[1:03:05] into the lives of Joseph and Moses what
[1:03:08] what we can draw and find from that
[1:03:11] perspectives on life in Israel from the
[1:03:13] time of Joshua to the time of Jesus
[1:03:15] church history history of Judaism all
[1:03:20] sorts of things so I thought oh okay
[1:03:22] Lord after prayer and seeking the
[1:03:26] guidance of the Holy Spirit for this
[1:03:27] evening I said Lord what are these can I
[1:03:33] share tonight which of these can I dig
[1:03:37] into and what did you say nope nope what
[1:03:46] happens panic I've only got a day and a
[1:03:51] half to prepare go what what Lord Lord
[1:03:55] Lord what do you want me to share that
[1:03:59] will be helpful for at least someone in
[1:04:01] the congregation you probably have all
[1:04:06] seen this picture in the past in the
[1:04:09] house of my child though with the
[1:04:11] raising of the flag on Mount Suribachi
[1:04:13] and uwajima it was hanging out a bedroom
[1:04:16] wall it was signed by the photographer
[1:04:17] Joe Rosenthal of The Associated Press it
[1:04:21] was a small scrap of slightly yellowing
[1:04:23] paper typewritten for those of you there
[1:04:26] don't know what typewriters a mechanical
[1:04:28] thing that sort of like a printer and
[1:04:30] that small scrap of paper it had
[1:04:33] Philippians 4:13 I can do all things
[1:04:36] through Christ which strengtheneth me
[1:04:38] and there's a little kid growing up and
[1:04:40] learning to read and always seeing that
[1:04:41] picture and I wondered what's that
[1:04:43] pictured there but what does it ask my
[1:04:44] dad and and and why is that first stuck
[1:04:48] in that picture what's going on here and
[1:04:50] and you just say well it's a photo of
[1:04:53] Marines raising the flag on Mount
[1:04:56] Suribachi well if you tell that to Abel
[1:05:00] he's just gonna give you a funny look
[1:05:01] and I'm sure I gave my dad a funny look
[1:05:03] too but but that's kind of what I was
[1:05:05] told and left with it I wasn't told it
[1:05:09] was on emoji WA II wajima there was no
[1:05:12] additional explanation given to this
[1:05:14] curious little kid Lord
[1:05:19] what would you have me share with a
[1:05:21] congregation tonight and my thoughts
[1:05:24] began to focus
[1:05:25] I'm tomorrow's national holiday Memorial
[1:05:29] Day Memorial Day isn't the kind of day
[1:05:32] where you say happy Memorial Day
[1:05:34] it isn't about barbecues
[1:05:38] it isn't about military veterans
[1:05:41] it isn't about those that are serving in
[1:05:43] uniform today Memorial Day is about
[1:05:46] remembering and mourning the loss of the
[1:05:49] people who defended our country that
[1:05:51] didn't come home unless it was in a body
[1:05:53] bag or a casket it's about reflecting on
[1:05:57] the great cost in lives to secure and
[1:05:59] maintain the freedoms that we enjoy and
[1:06:01] the values that we cherish
[1:06:03] it's about reflecting on how great a
[1:06:06] cost are we am I willing to pay to allow
[1:06:11] others to share these freedoms the
[1:06:14] holiday was originally called decoration
[1:06:16] day and it started as a their lives
[1:06:20] during the Civil War it was first
[1:06:21] observed nationally on May 30th 1868 so
[1:06:26] one of the oldest holidays we have it
[1:06:28] was always on May 30th through 1970 then
[1:06:31] Congress passed a law and made it the
[1:06:33] last the last Monday of May well you
[1:06:38] know there's there's a comment
[1:06:41] we did to Joseph Stalin Joseph Stalin
[1:06:43] was a brutal dictator of the Soviet
[1:06:46] Union from 1924 until his death in 1953
[1:06:49] and it's often paraphrased in this way
[1:06:51] what one death is a tragedy a million
[1:06:54] deaths is just and it reminded me it's a
[1:06:58] bit like today we learned that almost a
[1:07:00] hundred thousand Americans have died
[1:07:02] from or with covin 19 but unless you
[1:07:06] know someone who has suffered or
[1:07:09] succumbed or lost their livelihood
[1:07:11] because of it it's a statistic a sad
[1:07:14] statistic but it's a statistic well this
[1:07:22] is a photo of my father's younger
[1:07:24] sibling Vernon Johnson I carry his name
[1:07:28] is my middle name
[1:07:29] Lyle Vernon Johnson my Uncle Vernon who
[1:07:32] was born in Berkeley California during
[1:07:34] the flu pandemic of 1918 he was newly
[1:07:38] married and in the summer of 1944 was
[1:07:41] drafted for the war effort in the
[1:07:42] Pacific at the age of 25 or 26 private
[1:07:45] Johnson was assigned to and served with
[1:07:47] the 24th Marines 4th division Memorial
[1:07:53] Day 1945 was a very hard day for my dad
[1:07:56] my mom my dad siblings his parents many
[1:08:01] of their friends the war had ended in
[1:08:02] Europe on May 8th it wouldn't end in the
[1:08:05] Pacific until August 15th sometime
[1:08:09] between May 8th and May 30th my
[1:08:12] grandfather and grandmother were
[1:08:14] notified that Vernon probably would not
[1:08:16] be coming home he was listed as missing
[1:08:20] in action on March 2nd 1945 during the
[1:08:24] battle for Iwo Jima it wasn't until the
[1:08:28] 1960s or 70s that his status was changed
[1:08:30] to killed in action one of 6,800
[1:08:35] Americans who lost their lives on that
[1:08:36] tiny desolate rocky island and the vast
[1:08:39] Pacific Ocean my grandmother couldn't
[1:08:47] biggest child being missing was he alive
[1:08:50] was he dead there's no certainty there's
[1:08:53] no closure was he in Japanese hands was
[1:08:57] he first horrible way dying like those
[1:09:00] on the Death March of the tongue
[1:09:03] maybe he'd escaped and was hiding
[1:09:05] somewhere if so would he be found
[1:09:09] was he languishing in some despicable
[1:09:11] prison in the Pacific would she get news
[1:09:14] that for Imperial Japan surrendered in
[1:09:16] August at that they found him he was he
[1:09:18] was in a prison someplace and he's alive
[1:09:20] and they was finally gonna come home
[1:09:25] there were no answers for a grieving
[1:09:27] mother my grandmother became a casualty
[1:09:32] not listed or the battle for Iwo Jima
[1:09:35] she was in and out of the state mental
[1:09:36] hospital in California she died in that
[1:09:39] hospital e years later in 1953 that's
[1:09:42] that's a photo of my grandfather
[1:09:44] visiting her at the hospital trying to
[1:09:46] encourage her and comfort her she was
[1:09:49] yet another immigrant who came to
[1:09:51] America married a kind and general
[1:09:54] Christian man and lost her baby boy to
[1:09:57] War Memorial Day is to remember the
[1:10:02] fallen to mourn and yet terrifies us to
[1:10:06] appreciate not to celebrate it's about
[1:10:09] battles
[1:10:10] it's about battles what did we hear this
[1:10:12] morning it's about battles it's not
[1:10:14] about picnics but this is a church we
[1:10:19] worship Jesus Christ this isn't a civic
[1:10:21] center for a national memorial this is
[1:10:23] not a cemetery
[1:10:24] we're not gathered here tonight to wave
[1:10:26] the Stars and Stripes or mourn the loss
[1:10:29] of loved ones who gave that last full
[1:10:30] measure so that we can enjoy the
[1:10:33] freedoms then why are you bringing this
[1:10:39] up because I believe that the Lord wants
[1:10:44] to remind us that we are in the midst of
[1:10:46] a battle where within the greatest war
[1:10:49] of all time the fight between good and
[1:10:52] evil to struggle between God and Satan
[1:10:54] and we aren't just in it we're not
[1:10:57] spectators of a crowd cheering our team
[1:10:59] or our side or watching
[1:11:00] a couple of gladiators battle no we're
[1:11:04] expected we're not expected we're
[1:11:06] required to join the fight we're
[1:11:10] required to be soldiers on the
[1:11:12] frontlines this is a battle it's not a
[1:11:15] picnic Paul tells us in Ephesians
[1:11:18] chapter 6 starting at verse 10 finally
[1:11:22] my brethren and search yourself
[1:11:25] finally while Johnson the worshippers at
[1:11:28] Tucson Tabernacle finally be strong in
[1:11:32] the Lord and in the power of his might
[1:11:35] it's his strength not our weakness and
[1:11:41] search your name error lyall answers
[1:11:45] your name put on the whole armour of God
[1:11:48] this this isn't a suggestion this is not
[1:11:52] a suggestion put on the whole armour of
[1:11:55] God why why it's kind of bulky and that
[1:12:01] she may be able to stand against the
[1:12:03] wiles the craftiness the deceits of the
[1:12:06] devil armor as defensive it's to protect
[1:12:10] us from the enemy's attacks for we
[1:12:19] wrestle we now this is a get put your
[1:12:22] name in here for me each of us wrestle
[1:12:27] not against flesh and blood or a virus
[1:12:30] but against principalities against
[1:12:33] powers against the rulers of the
[1:12:36] darkness of this world brother Branham
[1:12:38] called this Satan's Eden against
[1:12:42] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:12:45] that's not talking about the White House
[1:12:48] or the government and the Bible high
[1:12:50] places are places of worship there were
[1:12:51] they they went up to high places and put
[1:12:53] up idols and worship calves and all that
[1:12:55] sort of thing spiritual wickedness in
[1:12:58] places of worship we're fighting against
[1:13:01] that wherefore take unto you again put
[1:13:08] in your name
[1:13:08] take take unto yourself the whole armour
[1:13:12] of God
[1:13:13] not the party light note the part you're
[1:13:15] comfortable with not the part that looks
[1:13:17] spiffy you need it all that ye but you
[1:13:22] and me each of us may be able to
[1:13:25] withstand the evil day what's the evil
[1:13:28] day March 24th 2020 if the God gives us
[1:13:31] tomorrow March 25th 2020 the evil day is
[1:13:34] today and having done all Oh what is all
[1:13:39] putting on that armor having put on that
[1:13:41] armor stand don't sit don't hide don't
[1:13:44] cower at some point your exit training
[1:13:47] and you go into the battleground stand
[1:13:51] therefore he's encouraging as Paul is
[1:13:54] now stand therefore having your loins
[1:13:56] gird about with truth not not with lies
[1:13:58] not with guesses not with suppositions
[1:14:01] we have a sure word in our day remember
[1:14:04] when when when Jesus stood before Pilate
[1:14:06] and he said I'm like aim to testify of
[1:14:10] the truth and Pilate said what's truth
[1:14:13] that's how he regarded truth but what
[1:14:16] did Jesus say in another place I am the
[1:14:20] way the truth the life the truth isn't
[1:14:22] just a set of indisputable facts the
[1:14:24] truth is a person the truth is a spirit
[1:14:27] it's a spirit of Jesus Christ having on
[1:14:30] the breastplate what does a breastplate
[1:14:31] do it protects your chest to protect
[1:14:35] your heart it protects your lungs
[1:14:38] receive the Holy Spirit the breath of
[1:14:41] life put on the breastplate of
[1:14:44] righteousness what is a breastplate of
[1:14:48] righteousness abraham believed God and
[1:14:50] it was counted to him as righteousness
[1:14:53] do you believe God tonight do I remember
[1:14:58] this is to ward off the wiles the
[1:15:00] attacks of the devil and your feet fit
[1:15:05] this we're not paratroopers we're not
[1:15:07] mechanised infantry or we're not riding
[1:15:09] around in tanks that's not the kind of
[1:15:11] armor we're talking about where we march
[1:15:14] this is infantry so your feet that's how
[1:15:17] you march to an engage in battle and you
[1:15:20] don't want to use those feet to run from
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:22] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[1:15:25] of peace it takes prepper
[1:15:27] training practice a person that's gonna
[1:15:29] run a marathon doesn't just get up one
[1:15:31] day from the breakfast table push the
[1:15:33] chair back and say oh there's a marathon
[1:15:34] today I think I'm gonna run it they
[1:15:36] train and train and train otherwise they
[1:15:40] collapse at about mile zero point one
[1:15:42] right above all above all taking the
[1:15:47] shield of faith what is it about a
[1:15:49] shield a shields not like a breastplate
[1:15:51] we're strapped you you holding the
[1:15:52] shield it's mobile its defensive you can
[1:15:55] see where the attack is coming from and
[1:15:57] ward it off you have to see the attack
[1:16:01] that's coming you have to move the
[1:16:03] shield you have to ward it off but if
[1:16:05] you put it in the right place if you put
[1:16:08] it in the right place the shield of
[1:16:10] faith not of doubt where with you put in
[1:16:16] your name shall be able to quench the
[1:16:18] fiery darts of the wicked the shield if
[1:16:23] you put it in the right place and we'll
[1:16:27] make the attacks of the enemy
[1:16:29] ineffective it'll cause a little
[1:16:32] frustration on the other side and take
[1:16:36] the helmet then the helmet protects your
[1:16:40] head protects your mind protect your
[1:16:44] eyes they home it ok so far this this
[1:16:50] armor is all defensive in nature and
[1:16:52] what's next and the sword of spirit
[1:16:55] which is a Word of God
[1:16:56] now we're moving into offensive weaponry
[1:16:59] it's not just defense we're not just
[1:17:01] warding off flows now we can attack it's
[1:17:05] how we take the battle to the enemy you
[1:17:07] never win a war or a football game by
[1:17:10] defense only you need effective offense
[1:17:14] to overpower the enemy an effective
[1:17:16] defense to deflect his attacks and it
[1:17:18] isn't just weapons it's not like wow
[1:17:21] I've got all this stuff like when David
[1:17:23] was a young man and he came to the
[1:17:25] camped where his brothers were part of
[1:17:27] the army except they had forgotten that
[1:17:29] they were in a battle they were kind of
[1:17:31] cowering and there's this big guy
[1:17:33] Goliath up there that's making all this
[1:17:35] noise these challenges and David goes
[1:17:37] there and and
[1:17:39] and he's just there to check on his
[1:17:41] brothers and maybe he thought it was a
[1:17:43] picnic he brought him some food or
[1:17:45] something right but it turned out that
[1:17:46] it was a battle it wasn't a picnic so
[1:17:49] what did he do he said I could do this
[1:17:54] with God's help I can do this and they
[1:17:57] and they finally agreed to let him do it
[1:17:58] and they have this big pile of stuff
[1:18:00] well here's this armor and here's this
[1:18:01] helmet and here's this sword that you
[1:18:03] could hardly pick and David said no
[1:18:07] preparation I've never used this stuff
[1:18:09] before I don't know how this works
[1:18:11] I've got a sling I'll go down to the
[1:18:13] brook Oh Oh get some stones and he got
[1:18:16] those stones and he waved each one in
[1:18:18] his hand was the right weight the right
[1:18:20] shape he put her in his pouch and it
[1:18:22] wasn't a sling that he had just gotten
[1:18:24] the day before on his birthday he'd used
[1:18:27] this thing he knew how to wield it he
[1:18:29] knew how to use the weapon that he had
[1:18:30] and he used it okay let's move on okay
[1:18:45] continuing on remember with offensive
[1:18:48] weapons now we've had the defense we're
[1:18:50] into offense praying always with all
[1:18:53] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[1:18:56] okay
[1:18:57] strange as it may seem prayer is our
[1:19:01] most powerful defense as well as our
[1:19:04] offense its experience its training it's
[1:19:08] clear communications to receive orders
[1:19:11] so you can execute the battle plan with
[1:19:13] precision and coordination with the
[1:19:16] other soldiers that are fighting this
[1:19:17] battle with you and watching all prayer
[1:19:23] supplications and watching what is that
[1:19:25] be alert
[1:19:27] sleep with one eye open keep your lamp
[1:19:30] trimmed and clear right washing
[1:19:34] thereunto with all perseverance what is
[1:19:37] perseverance never give up never
[1:19:42] surrender
[1:19:43] accept his brother Aaron's been telling
[1:19:45] us on Wednesday night surrender to the
[1:19:46] Lord but never surrender to the enemy
[1:19:49] and supplication for All Saints it's not
[1:19:52] just for yourself we're in this together
[1:19:57] I was talking to brother Larry get her a
[1:20:00] few weeks just after service briefly one
[1:20:03] before we went into our sequester and he
[1:20:08] said he said I pray for you you pray for
[1:20:11] me that's how it works
[1:20:13] that's exactly it it's not complicated
[1:20:17] but it's essential and for me Paul in
[1:20:21] this case Paul's making his personal now
[1:20:23] he says you do this you put on this and
[1:20:26] and and and while you're doing this
[1:20:28] don't forget me Paul that utterance
[1:20:31] words that words may be given unto me
[1:20:35] Paul the first church age messenger that
[1:20:39] I may open my mouth boldly to make known
[1:20:42] the mystery of the gospel the mystery of
[1:20:45] the gospel Christo and vosotros plus
[1:20:50] fir'aun's de Gloria Christ in you the
[1:20:53] hope of glory right Colossians 1:26
[1:20:57] Paul this is the Apostle the church age
[1:21:00] messenger the fellow who basically
[1:21:02] founded the Christian religion Jesus
[1:21:04] wasn't a Christian Jesus was Jewish
[1:21:07] right but he forms the basis of our
[1:21:11] Christian faith and doctrine and belief
[1:21:13] and he points out that without the
[1:21:15] backing of prayer without the backing of
[1:21:19] other believers he's gonna fail just as
[1:21:23] we heard this morning the things that I
[1:21:24] would do I don't do it the things that I
[1:21:27] shouldn't do I find myself doing I need
[1:21:29] your support I need your prayer Paul is
[1:21:31] saying we need each other support each
[1:21:34] other's prayers and he asks for boldness
[1:21:38] if you're gonna carry the battle to the
[1:21:40] enemy offense requires boldness for
[1:21:46] which Paul says he is an ambassador or
[1:21:51] as an ambassador as a representative the
[1:21:54] ambassador of the United States to to
[1:21:56] Russia is in Moscow but he speaks for
[1:21:59] the United States he speaks on behalf of
[1:22:01] the United States Paul says I'm an
[1:22:03] ambassador a representative for Christ
[1:22:06] and bonds but even so that they're in as
[1:22:12] an ambassador in spite of my bonds I may
[1:22:15] speak boldly he's again asking for
[1:22:17] boldness not to speak harshly not to
[1:22:20] speak condemning Li but to speak without
[1:22:24] fear speaking what he knows to be the
[1:22:28] truth regardless of the consequences
[1:22:31] that I may speak boldly as I ought to
[1:22:34] speak he's repeating this request Paul
[1:22:37] knew his mission he knew his strengths
[1:22:40] he knew his weaknesses he knew what he
[1:22:42] had to do but he's still implored
[1:22:44] whoever read this letter to pray for him
[1:22:48] that he'll be able to do what he knows
[1:22:51] he needs to do Jesus and guests Emmett
[1:22:54] he was looking for backup he told his
[1:22:56] disciples watch with me they fell asleep
[1:23:01] are you sleeping Am I
[1:23:06] we see that were to be dressed for
[1:23:09] battle and it's not just dress it's not
[1:23:11] a costume party it's not just put on
[1:23:15] this buffer now you're a soldier there's
[1:23:17] training that's involved it's one thing
[1:23:19] to dress like a soldier it's another to
[1:23:22] be one but we are to be properly and
[1:23:24] completely outfitted trained and
[1:23:26] prepared Jesus told us we talked about
[1:23:31] this a few months ago Jesus is the bread
[1:23:33] of life
[1:23:34] he's the fountain of living waters he'll
[1:23:36] sustain us we need to engage the enemy
[1:23:42] boldness to take the battle to the enemy
[1:23:45] well if you're going to do that if I'm
[1:23:49] going to take the battle to the enemy if
[1:23:50] if my Uncle Vernon was gonna fight the
[1:23:52] Japanese on Iwo Jima but he was in
[1:23:54] Sydney Australia he's not going to be
[1:23:56] engaged in the battle you've got to know
[1:24:00] where that battle ground is we know
[1:24:02] where that battle ground is brother
[1:24:03] branham told us the greatest battle
[1:24:05] we'll ever fight is in the battleground
[1:24:07] of our minds in 1962 he preached in
[1:24:10] March just a couple of excerpts from the
[1:24:13] greatest battle ever fought when
[1:24:15] great battle started on earth there had
[1:24:17] to be a mutual meeting place there had
[1:24:20] to be a place selected it's not random a
[1:24:23] place selected for the battle to begin
[1:24:26] and for the battle to rage it's not just
[1:24:30] an easy gentle all throw a stick at you
[1:24:33] you threw his stick at me the battle
[1:24:35] rages and that battle grounds begin in
[1:24:39] the human mind that's where the battle
[1:24:42] starts the human mind was chosen we were
[1:24:46] created the human mind was chosen for
[1:24:51] the place of battle where it was began
[1:24:53] that is because that decisions are made
[1:24:55] from the mind the head a little later he
[1:24:58] says decisions are made in the mind the
[1:25:01] head that is where Satan meets you and
[1:25:07] the decisions are because God made a man
[1:25:10] that way a little later he says it must
[1:25:14] be accepted in the mind that's first
[1:25:17] that's the battleground you win the mind
[1:25:20] you take the heart right it must be
[1:25:22] accepted in the mind then it's believed
[1:25:26] with a heart first the mind then the
[1:25:29] heart doesn't work the other way believe
[1:25:32] with the heart then after loosing their
[1:25:36] head yard then the word of God becomes a
[1:25:39] reality
[1:25:40] oh then every senses of soul and body
[1:25:45] has just scoured out with the Holy
[1:25:47] Spirit then your sense of God your
[1:25:49] conscience of God everything that's
[1:25:51] godly flows through you does it come
[1:25:54] from you it comes from him but it flows
[1:25:56] through there's not a doubt anywhere
[1:26:02] there's nothing can rise up ok so notice
[1:26:07] further in Ephesians fix 6 there's
[1:26:12] listed no mirror
[1:26:14] there's no looking-glass in a modern
[1:26:17] army that there's a buddy system you put
[1:26:19] on your gear and your buddy checks to be
[1:26:21] sure that it's all right if you're
[1:26:22] jumping out of the airplane if you're a
[1:26:24] paratrooper you want somebody to check
[1:26:26] to be sure that that strapped on right
[1:26:28] or there's gonna be a mess in a few
[1:26:30] minutes right and he he confirms yours
[1:26:33] is correct you confirm his is correct
[1:26:34] you trust him with your life
[1:26:37] he trusts you with his life it's well
[1:26:44] there's nothing new about the buddy
[1:26:45] system that's how Jesus sent His
[1:26:47] disciples look in mark 6 and he called
[1:26:49] him to him the twelve and began to send
[1:26:51] him forth well you go here and you three
[1:26:54] go there and no no he sent him forth
[1:26:56] two-by-two and gave him power over
[1:26:59] unclean spirits John the Baptist did the
[1:27:02] same thing in Luke 7 and John calling
[1:27:04] unto him two of his disciples not three
[1:27:07] not five in the mouth of two witnesses
[1:27:09] that everything two of his disciples to
[1:27:12] Jesus saying art that he that should
[1:27:15] come or do we look for another referring
[1:27:21] again to Hebrews 11 Paul lists several
[1:27:25] names some of you may recall a couple of
[1:27:28] years ago when we were talking about
[1:27:30] Abraham hebrews records his faith
[1:27:34] Genesis reveals his flaws lately in our
[1:27:38] morning devotions Heather and I have
[1:27:40] been reading from the book of Judges for
[1:27:43] me personally this is a very difficult
[1:27:46] portion of the Bible to read and it may
[1:27:50] not simply be due to the seemingly
[1:27:52] wanton violence the incredible cruelty
[1:27:56] just regard for God the almost instant
[1:27:59] reversion to carnality when God helps
[1:28:01] them out of their latest bad spot maybe
[1:28:04] maybe it's difficult for me because I
[1:28:06] don't want to see myself reflected in
[1:28:09] the actions of the descendants of Jacob
[1:28:11] or in the character flaws of so many of
[1:28:14] the judges maybe
[1:28:17] maybe it's hard to read because I do see
[1:28:21] many of those same flaws and those same
[1:28:23] problems in my own life Paul lists among
[1:28:26] the heroes of faith gideon samson
[1:28:30] jephthah
[1:28:30] all three had serious flaws yet God saw
[1:28:33] fit to use them in their day and
[1:28:37] celebrate their faith and Hebrews eleven
[1:28:40] he could look beyond their present
[1:28:43] circumstances even their continued
[1:28:45] ongoing disobedience that which I would
[1:28:49] do I find myself not doing that which
[1:28:51] Paul had that same kind of problem right
[1:28:53] as he empowered them to fulfill his
[1:28:56] purposes through them we have to carry
[1:29:00] the battle but it's not about us it's
[1:29:02] not our strength
[1:29:03] it's his strength it's not our weakness
[1:29:05] it's not our flaws in spite of these
[1:29:10] flaws and lapses maybe the book of
[1:29:12] Judges is really emphasizing the grace
[1:29:16] of God and it pretty well leaves us
[1:29:20] leaves Lyle Johnson put your name in
[1:29:23] there without excuses well I'm closing
[1:29:29] now probably be a good time for the
[1:29:36] musicians to consider coming this way I
[1:29:39] found this image it's the final war bond
[1:29:44] Drive of world war two I found I thought
[1:29:50] eerily appropriate to end tonight's
[1:29:51] message this is the seventh war bond
[1:29:53] Drive you'll see the big seven on there
[1:29:57] the end of that war bond Drive the end
[1:30:00] of that seventh Drive ended in victory
[1:30:02] for our nation and unconditional
[1:30:04] surrender of our enemies this is the
[1:30:06] seventh Church age this is Laodicea it's
[1:30:10] going to culminate in the ultimate
[1:30:12] victory over our enemies these guys are
[1:30:16] doing what they're raising the standard
[1:30:18] in this case it's the Stars and Stripes
[1:30:22] we need to raise the standard of Jesus
[1:30:24] Christ over the battleground over our
[1:30:27] minds even as the battle is raging
[1:30:29] to graph that this is based on they just
[1:30:31] always taken on February 23rd of 1945
[1:30:34] the Battle of Iwo Jima was raging it
[1:30:37] took two or three more weeks before the
[1:30:39] battle was over and look at the message
[1:30:43] on the poster now altogether and isn't
[1:30:49] that exactly what we need to be now
