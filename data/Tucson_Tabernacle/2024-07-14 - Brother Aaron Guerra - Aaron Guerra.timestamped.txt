[39:40] amen you may be seated here thank
[39:45] you before I forget brother Ed asked me
[39:48] to make this
[39:50] announcement they're going to start
[39:52] working on the putting in the flooring
[39:54] here in the fellowship hall so this
[39:57] Wednesday please come around they're
[39:59] going to keep this locked because they
[40:00] will be working on the floor it may be
[40:03] ready by Sunday if the do is unlocked on
[40:06] Sunday then you can come
[40:08] in that way we're not tracking any of
[40:11] the what they're working on and every
[40:15] every week in the past and we have to do
[40:17] that something else is getting
[40:20] accomplished and I know sometimes it
[40:22] seems like a long time and if it seems
[40:24] like it's a long time for you can
[40:26] imagine how long has been for brother Ed
[40:29] dealing with this but thank you brother
[40:31] Ed for for doing that all of you that
[40:32] have helped appreciate
[40:36] that and uh so it's good to be in the
[40:40] house of the Lord and uh where did
[40:43] Brother Daniel go he walked out but I
[40:45] believe some of the folks here said
[40:46] they're brother Daniel's friends so
[40:49] welcome good to have you with us so
[40:52] appreciate
[40:55] that now we know that brother Daniel has
[40:57] friends how do you like that it's good
[41:00] young man
[41:02] but when brother our pastor brother Dan
[41:05] had it asked me to cover tonight as he
[41:07] was going out going to be out of town
[41:09] for a few
[41:11] days I had
[41:14] um I was listening to a brother Minister
[41:17] I don't know the brother personally he
[41:19] was
[41:20] online but he shared some things that
[41:23] really spoke to my
[41:24] heart and sometimes they're practical
[41:28] things to help us
[41:31] daily
[41:33] um sometimes God is good to us and he he
[41:36] reveals himself to us he He makes
[41:38] himself known but sometimes we just need
[41:40] some daily help how do how do work
[41:43] through something how to deal with
[41:45] something um you know as as uh as
[41:51] parents usually the first child gets a
[41:54] lot of
[41:55] attention um
[41:58] you maybe they're the the last ones to
[42:01] learn to walk because you hold them all
[42:04] the
[42:05] time in our case there were six
[42:08] daughters and basically the last ones
[42:11] got taught by their older
[42:13] sisters you know it's just how it how it
[42:16] goes and by the grace of God last week
[42:19] and my wife and myself celebrated our
[42:22] 45th
[42:23] anniversary and
[42:28] she said you're a
[42:30] keeper which I'm
[42:33] glad but then I asked her why and she
[42:36] said because I don't want to train
[42:37] another
[42:40] one but you know life is constant
[42:43] training life is constant
[42:45] learning
[42:48] um as time go on somebody May specialize
[42:51] in something that you have some
[42:53] difficulty with but there's things that
[42:55] you do that you can help others with
[42:57] with it's part of the family it's part
[42:59] of the body just like looking at your
[43:01] body you don't see through your ears but
[43:04] you see through your
[43:05] eyes but your eyes can't hear your ears
[43:08] do that so it's all part of the body and
[43:12] as as I was listening to this brother
[43:13] Minister I it just really spoke to me I
[43:16] shared it some with brother Daniel this
[43:19] past week and he said be sure you give
[43:23] the
[43:24] testimony along with this so
[43:27] just going to share some things with you
[43:30] but we know that God said and and we'll
[43:32] take that first
[43:34] scripture and I believe and I believe
[43:37] you believe that God's word is is
[43:40] true and it accomplishes what he says
[43:43] it'll
[43:44] do he said heavens and earth shall pass
[43:47] away but my word shall not pass
[43:52] away and and God's word are faithful
[43:55] it's true
[43:57] and and it doesn't it's not something is
[43:59] going to be there tomorrow it's still
[44:01] here you know and then in Proverbs
[44:06] 2511 a word fitly spoken is like apples
[44:10] of gold in pictures of
[44:13] silver and if you just look at that
[44:16] sometimes you go what do they really
[44:18] mean and I I just like this more modern
[44:22] translation a word of
[44:25] counsel or proof rightly
[44:29] spoken rightly spoken is especially
[44:34] beautiful as the fruit becomes still
[44:36] more beautiful in silver
[44:39] baskets and I could see that picture of
[44:42] the basket holding the fruit and the
[44:44] basket itself is
[44:45] beautiful you're not eating the basket
[44:48] you want the fruit but the
[44:51] presentation if if that same fruit was
[44:54] laying on the floor you probably
[44:56] wouldn't want it to eat
[44:58] it at least pick it up and wash
[45:01] it but it's how sometimes it's
[45:05] presented
[45:07] so it it was the thought but I don't
[45:11] know how how each Minister gets their
[45:14] their thoughts and all but it seems like
[45:16] when you when I catch a thought
[45:18] everything just seems to come this ties
[45:20] to that this T and this came up somebody
[45:23] posted this and I'll read
[45:25] it it says in ancient Greece Socrates
[45:29] had a great reputation for
[45:31] wisdom one day someone came to find the
[45:34] great philosopher and said to him do you
[45:36] know what I heard about your
[45:39] friend and Socrates said a moment please
[45:42] he says before you tell me I would like
[45:45] to test it with these three
[45:47] seves the three seves he said yes before
[45:50] you speak about others it's important to
[45:53] take time to filter what you mean I call
[45:56] it the test test of three sees the first
[45:59] test of seeve is truth have you checked
[46:03] if what you're going to tell me is
[46:07] true well sometimes that stops the whole
[46:10] conversation right
[46:11] then and we're all guilty of
[46:14] that and he says no I just heard it well
[46:17] very well so you don't know if it's true
[46:19] let's move on to the second and that's
[46:22] of kindness is what you want to tell me
[46:25] about my friend something good
[46:27] good he says oh no on the
[46:31] contrary so question Socrates you want
[46:34] to tell me something negative about him
[46:37] and you're not even sure it's true
[46:39] perhaps you can still pass the test of
[46:42] the third seeve he say and it's called
[46:46] utility is it useful for me to know what
[46:48] you're going to tell me about this
[46:52] friend no not really he said
[46:57] therefore concluded Socrates what you're
[46:59] going to tell me is neither true nor
[47:01] good nor useful why then did you want to
[47:04] tell me
[47:07] this that's pretty plain English
[47:10] there gossip is a Bad Thing initially it
[47:14] may seem enjoyable and fun but
[47:17] ultimately it fills our hearts with
[47:19] bitterness and
[47:21] poisons and you would think a Christian
[47:24] doesn't suffer with those things
[47:26] but we all do there are things that that
[47:29] hurt us hurt us all even the word may be
[47:34] a good word but the tone and the
[47:37] attitude it's done with has a different
[47:43] effect in the in the
[47:49] message and and this was right out of
[47:52] one we just heard 57 Hebrews chapter 6
[47:55] number two
[47:59] and and I was on this thought when we
[48:02] got here and I believe they have the
[48:04] quote there but I'll read it to
[48:06] you one time I was walking out the door
[48:09] there and there was a lady come by and
[48:11] she said brother brandom oh how I
[48:13] enjoyed that message and I said Thank
[48:15] you made me feel good somebody else came
[48:18] by and said brother brandom I enjoyed
[48:20] that message and I said Thank
[48:22] you there was a little preacher there
[48:24] from up here in the north part of the
[48:26] country in in the state he said bless
[48:29] God I don't want people to brag on me
[48:31] like that and I said I
[48:35] do and then he said there's one
[48:37] difference between me and you I'm honest
[48:40] about it he said that's right we all
[48:43] like to hear nice words said about us
[48:46] and I think it's it's nice to say nice
[48:49] words about it if you want somebody to
[48:51] say nice words about you say some nice
[48:53] words about somebody else that's a way
[48:56] we do that then you'll always say nicest
[48:59] things when you can about everybody and
[49:02] that makes the wheel roll
[49:05] better and when you say something nice
[49:09] about somebody and it's true you don't
[49:12] have to worry about it you don't have to
[49:15] take it back you know it's like a pebble
[49:18] being thrown in a lake and it's in a
[49:19] pebble and that thing it just travels
[49:21] and travels and travels and travels hit
[49:23] the shore travels back and usually by
[49:25] the time it comes around the third or
[49:27] fourth time it don't sound nothing like
[49:28] what it started
[49:29] like and there you are trying to make
[49:33] so and and I I say this because I've
[49:36] done that by experience you learn that
[49:39] way you
[49:41] know in the message when love is
[49:45] projected I'm just going to take that
[49:47] last little
[49:49] part and and he
[49:51] says it it's that baby that that it's
[49:54] that part that her she wanted her son
[49:58] who who who was sick and he says I
[49:59] Dreamed a Dream she said I seen a man
[50:02] come walking down the street wearing a
[50:04] light tan suit and a tan hat and said
[50:08] the Lord said I'll send him and she said
[50:10] I've been standing here ever since
[50:12] daylight that's just the way and and
[50:15] brother bam says that's just the way I
[50:17] was dressed when love is projected with
[50:19] the right motive behind it div Divine
[50:23] Grace has to step in
[50:27] with the right
[50:29] motive love is
[50:32] love God is
[50:34] love I mean the scripture teaches that
[50:36] God is
[50:38] love okay there's no failure in that but
[50:41] what is the motive behind what you're
[50:45] doing and then uh from the message to
[50:49] the loudest in
[50:51] church he says I am kindly thinking this
[50:54] that many times a church in its
[50:57] looseness gets to doing things and
[50:59] thinking things and taking things just
[51:02] as they are when we ought to weigh what
[51:04] we do and say we ought to think it over
[51:08] before we speak it my old southern mommy
[51:11] used to tell me think twice and speak
[51:14] once it's a little thing sometimes that
[51:17] we leave undone that means so much to us
[51:20] we get in such a hurry to race over to
[51:22] the things in this neurotic age that we
[51:25] live in it would behoove us as a Church
[51:27] of God tonight to stop and wait a minute
[51:30] and see where we're
[51:31] at how many times have you stopped and
[51:34] looked and said oh had I taken one more
[51:36] step what trouble I would have gotten
[51:39] into you know it's
[51:41] it's it's it's part of life part of
[51:44] Being
[51:46] Human so if if I would title this
[51:51] message I would
[51:54] say your words
[51:57] the words you use to create an
[51:59] atmosphere because your words do have an
[52:03] effect uh you know you can say nice
[52:05] things about
[52:07] people and it doesn't
[52:10] make let me say this right you say nice
[52:13] things about people no matter how they
[52:15] accept
[52:16] them you're doing what you should be
[52:20] doing you can't control the way things
[52:22] are accepted by others but you have
[52:25] control about your your attitude on how
[52:27] you do
[52:31] that in
[52:34] Proverbs
[52:35] also chapter 18 verse
[52:41] 21 death and life are in the power of
[52:44] the
[52:47] tongue I think a lot of times we would
[52:49] just be quiet wouldn't
[52:51] we before before watching what we're
[52:54] saying we would just stop for a moment
[52:56] is this going to help somebody or is
[52:59] just because I want them to hear what I
[53:01] have to say
[53:04] you and they that love it shall eat the
[53:07] fruit thereof the power of of the tongue
[53:09] it's if if you're giving life you're
[53:12] encouraging somebody you're uplifting
[53:14] somebody you're helping somebody that is
[53:18] that is something they can partake
[53:22] of and as I was looking through and and
[53:25] you know you type into your
[53:27] your search word search in Bible
[53:29] apps and how many times the word word is
[53:32] used or words God chose to use language
[53:36] to
[53:38] speak for us to be able to communicate
[53:40] with each other now we can also
[53:43] communicate with how we're acting uh
[53:46] sometimes somebody says something and
[53:49] they say it nicely but their face looks
[53:52] mean it looks you now my daughter my son
[53:56] your father loves
[53:58] you I really really love you they're not
[54:01] getting any love out of how I'm coming
[54:04] across you know but it can be the other
[54:08] way too sometimes you have to be
[54:11] straight and direct brother brandom uses
[54:14] this example if your child is out in the
[54:16] middle of say right out here on Stone my
[54:19] little nephew Liam going out in the
[54:21] middle of the stone and the cars are
[54:22] going up and down Liam please Liam don't
[54:26] don't don't play in the street come on
[54:28] Liam no you would probably yell and
[54:30] scream and run out there to get him and
[54:32] save his life that has its place and its
[54:37] part so what brought this on I was
[54:39] listening to a
[54:42] testimony or or a sermon of brother I
[54:44] don't know the brother it was um I like
[54:47] I said I God has answered questions for
[54:51] me I'm I'm seeking him and I
[54:54] feel to just to listen to
[54:57] and and he'll answer something I I was
[55:00] questioning
[55:02] once uh the call of a
[55:05] Ministry some people who will travel all
[55:08] over the world spend their life out
[55:11] there but I don't have that call and I
[55:15] wondered I said Lord am I just
[55:18] lazy am I just not wanting
[55:22] to and I I it was troubling me for a
[55:25] time my my father did many many trips
[55:29] into Mexico Central and South America
[55:30] brother green 138 different countries
[55:34] but that was a calling in their
[55:36] lives and they went they wanted to and
[55:39] and I was listening to a brother and
[55:41] he's speaking and suddenly he stops and
[55:45] he says now you know the call in your
[55:46] life is not the same for
[55:49] everybody call that catches my attention
[55:52] because I was just asking the Lord about
[55:53] that and he says the call in your life
[55:57] to some they travel everywhere they they
[55:59] they minister they go out they do this
[56:01] they do that others God has you just
[56:03] stay
[56:04] home it didn't mean at your house but
[56:07] staying where you
[56:08] were to help those around
[56:11] you and then he went onto his
[56:16] subject and and that was brother Donnie
[56:19] Reagan we were in in a in a service this
[56:22] when I was at the service brother Baker
[56:24] had the the meetings down here
[56:27] and those of you have ever seen brother
[56:29] Donnie Reagan live or watch him brother
[56:32] gets excited and he's all over the place
[56:33] and just it's amazing you wonder how how
[56:36] can they could still walk after it's
[56:38] done that'd be done wore
[56:40] out and I was sitting there and I'm
[56:42] watching I'm sitting up higher up
[56:44] looking down
[56:45] and I just started thinking to myself
[56:48] that's how I need to minister that's how
[56:49] I need to be and I'm just thinking
[56:51] thinking I've got to you know and he
[56:54] comes across at the end and it looks
[56:55] like he's looking straight up at me and
[56:57] he goes now he says you got to be who
[56:59] like who you are you can't be like me
[57:02] you've got to make be exactly and then
[57:04] he stops and keeps right on
[57:07] going God will answer we'll talk to you
[57:10] we'll show you if you're willing to
[57:11] listen willing to hear but if we put a
[57:15] box around God and say this is how you
[57:18] have to speak to me this is the only way
[57:21] I'll
[57:22] listen by by his grace he'll break that
[57:24] box and then he'll talk to
[57:27] you and I I've always said break this
[57:29] box if it needs to be
[57:32] broken so this brother as I was
[57:35] listening listening to him and it just
[57:38] something pulled me to it I listened to
[57:40] it and um let me I wrote some notes down
[57:44] here so I could get it
[57:47] right and and again creating an
[57:50] atmosphere with your
[57:53] words the expectation
[57:56] or the faith of the
[57:59] hearer so that makes each one of you
[58:02] responsible
[58:03] today you're as much part of this
[58:06] service as I
[58:08] am you're going to get as much as you're
[58:11] willing to receive and
[58:14] pull sometimes we sit there and say
[58:17] minister to me to Ministry but we're not
[58:19] we're not drawing we're not pulling it's
[58:21] just the expectation or the faith of the
[58:24] hearer brings the anointing or the
[58:25] vision
[58:26] division to the ministering
[58:29] servant and the servant what he does is
[58:31] just yield himself could even be a
[58:34] sister talking to a sister a brother
[58:36] talking to a brother a wife talking to a
[58:39] husband if one will yield to I need some
[58:41] help and let God
[58:45] speak
[58:49] so again you put God in a box and you
[58:52] say this is God this is how it works
[58:55] this is how it has to be and God will
[58:57] break that box if you're one of
[59:00] his because he wants to get to you and
[59:03] talk to you and and make it personal
[59:06] with you he knows your name he knows who
[59:10] you
[59:11] are I know that I've shared that
[59:14] experience I asked him one day in in in
[59:17] frustration I said God do you know my
[59:19] name do you know
