sister Angela if it's okay I'll just read your text about uh sister Angela's neighbor um this kid he's believe he's 22 years old he um he was burned severely burned and um over a large portion of his body he had his arm amputated and um they didn't know that he was going to make it he's he's still doing okay sister Angela said the only update that we have is he had he had uh surgery again today to remove his ear on the right side due to the burns they were trying to save his eye as well as far as I know he's still in surgery the family said to keep praying they said they appreciate it and they feel the prayers and that is what is holding them together right now as they make these decisions so so brothers and sisters what greater Authority we could be a doctor we could be some sort of specialist but there's nothing greater than than bringing someone up before the Lord in prayer and let's continue to do that for this young man named Alex um I want to make a announcement this Friday night at 7 o'clock as I said on our announcement this morning we're going to have a youth Gathering uh here in the upper room for youth ages 16 and up unmarried 16 and up and if you're 13 or up and you have a sibling that can drive you're also welcome to come too so that's this this Friday and then I just asked sister Martha also to plan something for our younger youth um the ones below that age we haven't done anything for a while for them so we'll plan something and do something fun here in the near future um sister Faith God bless you it's good to have you back um and then the construction project it's going to be really nice when we finally get all of this done and we make room we'll have a little bit more room it'll be more efficient for all the people that are coming and going in our in our fellowship hall there brother Ed has been working hard we will hopefully get started next week we've already started pulling all the stuff out of the kitchen and as you've seen taking the stuff off the the walls pretty soon we're going to be um knocking down some walls and putting up walls and uh ripping out the floors and ripping out the ceiling and then once we get finish get close to finish over there maybe with two or three weeks left then we'll move over to the fellowship hall here and we'll start our Renovations in this area so I am really really looking forward to that I think it's something that's it's due and it's exciting for me I think it's going to be exciting for all of us I believe it's going to be a real blessing I got a hand it to brother Jeremy and sister Angela

or sister Angela could you hold up the little guy is he sleeping oh Grandma's got him there is this a foster child another one look look at this praise the Lord praise the Lord for what they're doing um I think that's all the announcements I have so on Wednesday nights brother Steve what we're doing is we are we have been doing a Bible study over the past year and we started with the book of Acts and we went chapter by chapter word by word through the entire book of of Acts it took us I don't know it took us 6 months or whatever it was and it was just such a blessing so I was praying about it and I thought let's just start in Genesis and we'll do this through the whole Bible so now we are devoting one service per book of the Bible so when we come in we can all know what the Book of Genesis is about what the book of Exodus and Leviticus is about just give us a broad overview of this so now we're devoting our Wednesday nights to a basic Bible Study last Wednesday we had I ministered on the first book of Kings we know that we had the end of David's life and David handed the kingdom over to his son Solomon Solomon reigned for 40 years and then Solomon towards the end of his life he began to stray and he had when he passed away his son rabam took over the kingdom split into the North and the South we had Judah and the South we had Israel up in the north and we left it with this man named Elijah stepping on the scene one of the greatest prophets that the world has ever seen as as I said we had one of the most evil Kings and the Bible even said he was the most evil King to that point that had ever been this man named Ahab and his wife was even eviler than than he was this woman named Jezebel and but when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises up a standard against it and he raised up this man Elijah to stand against this King named Ahab so we closed out with the towards the end of Elijah's Ministry and now brother brother ly will bring us into second Kings and that we'll see the um end of Elijah's Ministry and the start of Elisha the the Elisha's whole Ministry and we will go into the Kings but before we get there let's all stand and I would if you'd all bow your heads I would like us to pray for this young man Alex pray for as brother Aaron mentioned brother Aaron's parents both of them could use our prayers also remember brother Jeremy sister Angela and this great burden that they have and this great honor that they have in taking these children in that the Lord would give them wisdom and may they plant a seed in these kids that will BL them their whole life at seed of the Holy Spirit and the word of God and if you would have a request that's on your heart if you could make it known to the Lord with an uplifted hand Lord you know our needs but father you also required that we would bring our needs to you in prayer one for another Lord we ask for your mercies upon this young man Alex and Lord the very very hard thing that's happened to him and the burns and how they've covered his body father we pray that the great physician would come in and deal with him Lord of course with his body but most of all Lord that you would deal with his soul and that he would know the Lord Jesus and Lord we we don't know why these things happen but we pray that it would be to bring him closer to you father we pray for his family that you would give them strength and Lord may they their desires go to a living Jesus Christ a living [Music] healer father we pray that those that lifted up their hands Lord that it wouldn't just be something a tradition but it would father be that that hand was raised in faith and that you would look down and see a raised hand and that you would answer the prayers that were represented with that hand father we pray that your blessings would be upon our Renovations in our church Lord that it would be according to your will that every decision that would be made that it would be Lord your decision and not ours we pray strengthen us Lord and may we be good witnesses to this world and may be we stand as a lighthouse to everyone father that comes into contact with us bless bless brother Lyall we pray tonight strengthen him Lord and give him the wisdom to bring this word out in in the proper way father that we could leave here better people we pray we have confidence that it'll be in Jesus Christ's name amen sometimes praise the Lord sometimes you sing our hearts in one sometimes Hallelujah sometimes praise the Lord sometimes sing our hearts in what a sometimes [Music] hallelu sometimes praise the Lord sometimes our hearts in one thank you is that where we are tonight our hearts in one Accord one people joined together and the life the blood the sacrifice the love of Jesus Christ looks like it's the right slide tonight okay tonight we look at the book of Second Kings which covers a time period of around 270 years from about 855 BC at the death of King Ahab to about 587 BC with the destruction of Solomon's Temple we'll approach the study a little differently I won't give you a chapter by chapter summary uh and I didn't bring a copy of the daily parchment so I can't read you the headlines from that this time like we did for 2 Samuel but remember what we're presenting here in this series of the books of the Bible are overviews in one evening we just get glimpses of what each book contains seeing evidence of Jesus as the Messiah and finding at least one take-home thought or lesson to help us not just in our knowledge of biblical Israel but in practical application of our lives here and now I want to encourage you to follow along by reading each book at home and I trust you are doing that in your private devotions let God speak to your heart through his word developing and deepening your relationship with him and his relationship with you before we open our Bibles let's speak once more with the author Lord Jesus just in this silence we can sense your presence it's not loud it's not boisterous but Lord you're here I thank you for each person that's come that's brought that portion of the holy spirit in their lives to join together as we just sang hearts in one Accord Lord we pray that you'd speak to us this evening Lord by Your Word Lord I pray that the thoughts that I've got the the the Lord my biases my prejudices whatever Lord just give them out of the way Lord help Lord that that that I could be a channel somehow for you to touch each heart to reach each person that there be something that each person could go home and say wasn't Jesus good to us tonight Lord we thank you again for this awesome privilege of gathering behind this desk and gathering with your people Lord to just sharing your word we pray that you've accepted Our Praise Lord and now help us to be focused and concentrating and we thank you and that name above every name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen we're going to start our lesson with with a few verses from Genesis Jacob is fleeing from Esau he he's on his way to Syria and he sleeps along the road he's he's gone about 50 mil from home in Bev he's about 10 miles north of what will be Jerusalem he lays down by the side of the road he has a dream of a ladder reaching up to heaven and God is speaking to him Genesis 28 verse1 15 God says and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have SP spoken to thee of and Jacob awake out of his sleep and he said surely the the Lord's in this place and I I I didn't know it he was afraid he said how Dreadful this place is there's none other but the the house of God the Gate of Heaven and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it and he called the name of that place betel betel means bet means House El God house of God this is where God dwells this is his home but the name of that city was called L at the first please be seated as we study Second Kings you'll see that this place where Jacob slept beel plays a pivotal role in the history of Israel and Judah note it it's often confusing to hear the words Israel and Judah Israel is a name given to Jacob it's a name used to describe the people descended from Jacob in the Bible up until the time that this kingdom is split so I want to hopefully help reduce a little the confusion it's the name of the Modern Nation in the Middle East that we call Israel shown on the left of the screen once the ancient kingdom is is split it's as happened in First Kings the northern part continues to be called Israel this is the area shaded in light green on the right side of the screen a king of Israel rules this territory the southern part takes on the name of Judah this is shaded in lavender on the lower right part of the screen a king of Judah rules this territory I'll try to be clear about this as we go but for tonight's lesson in Second Kings the once you United Kingdom has been divided into these two Nations Israel and Judah please note the three red circles on the map at the right you don't have to read the names inside of them you can't from there and I can't from here but the upper one is the city of Dan and you can see in the Green Space it's way up at the northern tip of the area of the territory of Israel the other two are bethl and Jerusalem it's a little hard to see so let me let me zoom in for you here we see bethl that's near the center here it's just at the southern end of the territory of Israel just outside the area of Judah this is where Jacob slept that that we just read it's and about 10 miles it's only 10 miles from bethl to Jerusalem that's where Solomon built the temple which is in Judah and then finally just to add a little interest to the mix I put a a yellow circle around a town called Samaria this city is the capital of Israel when Second Kings refers to Samaria it's referring to this city when Second Kings refers to Samaritans it's referring to Residence of this city a Siege of Samaria means that this city is surrounded by an enemy Army ready to move on okay let's go the United Kingdom of all 12 Tribes of Jacob's descendants lasted for 120 years ruled by Saul for 40 years David for 40 years Solomon for 40 years after that it was divided into Israel and Judah do you recall why First Kings 11 verse 9 the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared unto him twice and had come commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the Lord commanded wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for as much as this is done of thee in other words it's on you Solomon and thou Hast not kept my commandment and my statuts which I have commanded Thee I will surely Rend the Kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant not your son your servant this is all about obedience it's not about privilege it's not about entitlement notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake but I will Rend it I'll tear it I'll rip it out of the hand of thy son how be it I will not Rend away all the kingdom but I will give One Tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake and for jerus M sake which I have chosen brother Daniel taught from First Kings last Wednesday and told how Solomon's son rabam followed some really bad advice and caused the nation to split 10 lines of Jacob's descendants set up their own Nation called Israel leaving rabo to rule the territories of Judah and Simeon Israel had a succession of bad kings there's not one of their kings they had that was good although some of them seemed to be good for a little while but but there was a problem that we'll discuss this evening all of them offended the Lord last week we saw how judgment fell on King Ahab and a prophecy came that his entire line of heirs would be killed that his wife Jezebel would literally be eaten by dogs now don't be afraid if you come and visit our house our dog's only this big he's not going to cause you a problem we're talking about some large canines recall in in First Kings 17 Elijah the tishbite a prophet appears and he declares a drought the drought lasts three and a half years second king says three years but when Jesus talks about it he clarifies that it was three and a half years we're all familiar with The Showdown on Mount Carmel well where the Lord sent fire to consume a burnt offering Elijah kills 450 prophets of baale and 400 prophets of what's called The Groves says all of which eat at Jezebel's table not ahab's table Jezebel's table now now a Grove here doesn't mean a copes of trees I have an Olive Grove it's not talking about that it's talking about an idol something that's been carved that's been engraved whether it's of stone whether it's of wood whether it's cast of molten metal it's talking about Idols when it talks about grow well rain comes to end the drought Elijah flees from Jezebel arriving eventually at Mount Orb also called called Mount Si turns out it's about 300 miles and it's in a cave there at Mount hor I wonder if it could have been a a cave that Moses had been in during his 40 days that he was there receiving the law but anyway we read that Elijah responds to the Lord who speaks to him and a quiet voice a still Small Voice Elijah was discouraged convinced he he's the only person following the Lord Lord take my life I'm the only one that's left the Lord admonishes him and says Elijah there are still 7,000 that haven't bowed the knee to bail 7,000 sounds like a lot but that's a tiny fraction probably less than 1% of the overall population of Israel they have really devolved really devolved in a short period of time in 80 years from the time of Solomon to the time we're at but the Lord told him more than that first Kings 19 there we are verse 15 and the Lord said unto Elijah go return on thy way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint heel to be king over Syria and juu the son of nimshi shall th anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of shaffat of Abal mahola shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room and as we'll find reading later that it was actually Elisha that anointed hael and anointed juu well a little time passes and Elijah confronts Ahab telling him all his male descendants will be killed and then and if J jeel also spake the Lord saying the dog shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel him that dieth of Ahab that's not who Ahab kills but he's talking about ahab's descendants of your descendants that die in the city the dogs will eat him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat they they won't get a decent burial these are horrific ends Ahab repents God tells Elijah the judgment will be delayed and until after Ahab dies he won't have to see it the judgment's going to come but Ahab won't have to personally experience it it'll come in the days of his sons and this brings us to Second Kings it opens with Elijah denouncing aazia ahab's successor who dies after reigning for only about a year meanwhile in Judah after 20 years of bad leadership under rabam and his son deijah a good King comes to the throne a fellow named ASA and and he's succeeded by Jehoshaphat who's another good ruler in Judah now you got that you've memorized all that you have the kind of a memory no neither do I I realize this chart's very busy it summarizes the various Kings after the United Kingdom is ripped apart there's there's a red line at the bottom and that's the transition from First Kings to Second Kings you notice on the left of the chart that there's a list of names that are difficult to see because most of you are sitting too far back but but it it it's a list of the various prophets that appear in the text these are all what we call oral prophets they have left no writings that have survived but we see that the Lord was continually present during this period continually present warning and admonishing he wasn't left without a witness he wasn't left not trying to get the people to come back to to him the two rightand columns list the Kings of Israel and the kings of Judah the the lengths of the Reign are shown along with the years that we know is BC don't worry about trying to read or absorb all of it I I wanted you to see that from the time the kingdom divided first king covers about 80 years some Kings ruled less than a year some as long as 40 years and that God always had Witnesses in the form of a prophet trying to get the people and their leaders back to worshiping the Lord you can notice by some names there's a little red thing it looks like a little Red Devil with a pitchfork though that represents those kings were not so good not so good some of them have a little green check mark with a halo over their head that means they they were the good guys okay so you can see Israel is full of bad guys and Judah gets some good guys from time to time that's a good thing well let's move on so there we go so Elijah we're now in the first part of this book of second king he should be taken up by the Lord and He tests Elijah by continually advising him to stay behind when Elijah travels on their their first stop red circle up there that yellow arrow their first stop is gilgal and Elijah says Elisha you stay here I I've got business to do down at bethl and Elisha said M no no you go I go so the next stop is bethl which we introduced in our first scripture reading this evening a group called sons of prophets tell Elisha that Elijah will be taken from him that day Elisha refuses to leave Elijah's side the third stop is Jericho and there's another group there that tells him the same thing the four stop is the Jordan River they get to the Jordan Elijah divides the waters and they cross 2 Kings 2:9 it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said to Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing and nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so it came to pass as they still went on and Tau Ed that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both aund and Elijah went up not in the fiery Chariot but by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more he took hold of his own clothes and r them in two pieces brother brandom used this story of Elijah and Elisha many times in his sermons I'd like to read a short excerpt from one of them called Witnesses it was spoken on uh April the 5th 1953 in the evening he says then he that's Elijah started from gilgal and he went on to the school of the prophets and I want you to notice when he got there at the school of the prophets he said the Lord's leading me to Jordan three stages that Elisha followed Elijah and Elijah was a type of Christ Elisha the type of the church I go up to gilgal First justification by faith and then he said now you stay here to the church Elijah Elisha to Elijah the young and old Prophet a type of Christ and the church he Elisha said as your soul lives I'll not stay here I'm going with you he went up to gilgal and when he got up there he Elijah said now now you stay here the the Lord's calling me up to the school of the prophets so he Elisha said as the Lord lives as your soul never die I'm going with you I'll not leave you that's the church he says keep your eyes on your pastor oh wait no it's not what it says um keep your eyes on the prophet oh no it doesn't say that either the Evangelist the teacher the person that led you to the Lord your favorite preacher a Christian influencer on YouTube or Tik Tok your Google search results no what did he say keep your eyes on Jesus wherever he moves go he says if he goes out of the Methodist Church go right on with him if he goes out of the Baptist Church go right on with him if he goes out of the brandom Tabernacle go right on with him I will not leave you no matter where Mama belonged where Papa belonged where this happened or another I'll go with you I'll not leave you Hallelujah he says I am your witness I can't go you're a part of me come on I'll follow and he goes to the school the prophets and he says oh you you stay here and some of the prophets said to Elisha he said do you know your master will be taken from you he said I know it hold your peace amen I like that I'm going to stay right with him no matter what the rest of them say and Elijah turned turned around and said now you Terry here God sending me to Jordan three places justification gilgal sanctification the school of the Prophet to the baptism of the Holy Ghost at Jordan where the Jordan represents death we know that means death to self well back to Second Kings Elijah just went up Elisha then crosses over the Jordan parting the river with Elijah's Mantle that that's his robe his cloak and regarding the double portion we find that there are twice as many Supernatural things recorded about Elisha's Ministry than Elijah's type of Christ type of the church you should remember what Jesus said you'll do more miracles than me greater than this shall you do because I go to the father so here again we see a type of Elisha is the church doing more miracles than Elijah as a type of Christ Elisha performs several Miracles as time moves along and then a curious thing happens God performs a miracle of healing on one of Israel's enemies second Kings chapter 5 now non captain of the host in other words general of the army of the king that's Ben Hadad of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria remember when we read in that Psalm and it said seah means stop think about that think about that delivered Syria from Israel the Lord did that he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on non wife so the captured Israelite became a house slave to non's wife and she said unto her mistress would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy well non goes to Israel with a lot of gold and a lot of stuff he offers the king a huge bounty to heal kill him the king's distraught he's thinking that Syria's trying to find an excuse to start another war with Israel they didn't do so good last time Elisha says the king don't worry send him over here and he'll show non that there is a prophet in Israel hey King you should be listening to me because watch watch what's going to happen non comes Elisha tells him to wash himself in the Jordan River seven times and his leprosy will be healed what did Jesus say this is a type of the church Elisha he said pray for them that persecute you and despitefully use you do good to your enemies well non's angry at first says there better rivers in the Jordan near Damascus where I come from I don't want to get in your crummy Little River I'll wash in my beautiful River back home his servants convinced him that look he didn't ask you to do do some great thing he just said jump in the water seven times what's the big deal so non gives in he does that goes in goes out nothing goes in goes out nothing six times nothing seventh time comes out totally restored totally restored Second Kings 5:15 and he nonon returned to the man of God he didn't just go home and say wow look at me there was something in his heart he returned to the man of God he and all his company and came and stood before Elisha and he said behold now I know that there is no God in all the Earth but in Israel now therefore I pray thee take a blessing of thy servant I got a lot of money I'm going to give you a lot of wealth you'll be set for life notice Israel saw Miracle after miracle and worshiped other gods anyway here's this Syrian an enemy worshiping who knows which gods but he experienced a miracle through obedience and humility and now realizes the truth he becomes a witness for the god of Israel and what had Elisha said that he would know there was a prophet in the land a prophet of the one true God Elisha refuses the gift freely have you receive freely give but gazi Elisha's servant then goes him and says hey how about a little I I got some friends and they need a little money wink wink Elisha finds out and gazi then receives not only non's little gift but he receives non's leprosy oops you recall from First Kings during that three and a half year drought Elijah went to a widow of sidon and stayed with her and her son and a miracle of continually replenished flour and oil occurred to sustain the three of them I've marked on the map there were Sid as you notice it's beyond the territory of Israel um it's in fact it's the place where Jezebel's from so it's I've circled it in red near the top of the map I circled Jerusalem for reference Jezebel the wife and influencer of Ahab at that time was as I said from siden but notice Elijah is staying in Gentile territory outside the land of Israel and sustaining a gentile Widow and her son here's what Jesus said about these two Miracles speaking in his hometown synagogue Luke 4:24 and Jesus said verily I say unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country and now he gives an example from First Kings he was here last Wednesday night brother he was here here we are I tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the Days of Elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Elijah sent save unto Serta a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow he goes on he talks about Second Kings many lepers were in Israel in the time of elishah the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving non the Syrian people don't like hearing that you know the story well shortly after non's healing the syrians under benh Hadad put the city of Samaria Under Siege it gets to be really really bad and then God miraculously scatters the syrians and after that Elisha makes his way to Damascus benh Hadad the king of Syria the guy that had sieged the city and done all this trouble he's sick and he hears Elisha's in town so he asks hael to inquire if he will recover ask this Prophet if if I'm going to get better 2 Kings 8:10 Elisha said unto haziel go say unto benh Hadad thou mayest certainly recover how be it the Lord has showed me that he shall surely die and Elisha settled his countenance steadfastly he stared at haziel for a long time just stared at him until hael was was ashamed he was embarrassed and finally staring at AEL Elisha began to cry he started to weep and haziel said why weepeth my Lord and Elisha answered answered because I I know the evil that thou wil do unto the children of Israel that their strongholds will without set on fire their young men you'll slay with a sword you'll Dash their children rip up the pregnant women and has El said but but what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing and Elisha answered the Lord has showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria hael returns to badad tells him yeah you you you should get better the Elisha said you should recover and then hael murders him that night takes the Throne of Syria two of the three things that God told Elijah in a still Small Voice in the cave at Horeb have come to pass Elisha has succeeded Elijah has the ell is been anointed king of Syria now comes the third and last item backt track to or forward track to 2 Kings n Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets and said unto him G up thy loins take this box of oil in thine hand and go to remote Gilead and when thou comest thither look out there yahu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of nimi and go in and make him arise from among his Brethren and and lead him to an inner chamber to a private room then take the box of oil pour it on his head and say thus sayeth the Lord I have anointed thee King over Israel and then young man open the door flee T not run for your life don't just Girt up your loins be sure you got your track shoes on so the young man even the young man the prophet went to remote Gilead and when he came behold the captains of the host were that's of the army were sitting and and he said I have an errand to thee O Captain and J said and to which of all of us and he said to thee Oh Captain juu arose and went to the house and he the the young Prophet poured oil on jah's head and said unto him thus sayith the Lord God of Israel I have anointed thee King over the people of the Lord even over Israel but he goes on and thou shalt Smite the house of Ahab thy master that I may Avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the Servants of the Lord at the hand of Jezebel for the whole house of Ahab Shall Perish I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in Israel and I will make the house of Ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of Basha the son of aijah and the dogs shall eat Jezebel and the portion of Jezreel and there shall be none to bury her and the young Prophet opened the door and fled ran for his life J's men say what went on he tells them and they declare him King J then gets and his Chariot heads from Samaria to Jezreel and he assassinates the king yoram one of ahab's sons hesia the king of Judah happens to be visiting joram beu takes the opportunity and kills him too verse 30 when J was come to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and fixed her hair and looked out a window Oh my he had another weak man for me to manipulate oh mirror mirror on the wall as as juu entered in at the gate she said a very curious thing had zimy peace who slew his master well you've you've been reading your Bibles at home so you know that that back in First Kings 16 that uh a fellow named zy killed the house of basa just like J Who was who's been killing the house of Ahab and then he only lived another seven days then he was killed and the prophet that predicted this was coincidentally named J so she's teasing and taunting J she knows what's going on and he lifted up his face to the window and said who's on my side who and and they looked out to him two or three unic and he said throw her down so they threw her down some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses maybe she was dead when she landed from the impact may maybe not but he troed her underfoot on his horse stomped her this is violent stuff made sure that she was dead and what did he do after that he goes in and did eat and drink oh that's been a long day I'm a little hungry right now all in a day's work oh oh go go go now see this cursed woman bury her for she is a King's Daughter he respected her as a daughter of a foreign King not as the wife of his former King and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands wherefore they came again and told him told J and juu and he said oh this is the word of the Lord which he spake by his servant Elijah the tishbites saying and the portion of jezrael shall dogs eat the Flesh of Jezebel and the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the porch of Jezreel so that they shall not say this is Jezebel she'll have no tomb she'll have no Shrine there won't be any people coming to lay flowers at her grave juu does many of the things the Lord asks of him ju is zealous but he also has those fatal flaws he continues to worship other gods and leave intact all the idols and practices which the Lord AB bores sorry and another busy chart but this shows the uh the Kings from juu to the conquest of Israel so this word says Israel Kings the little green up there is J's Reign and it comes down you see some of those guys didn't last very long one guy jeroboam II who was a bad guy and yet the Lord used him to save Israel uh for a time until we get down to 723 when they're carried off into captivity uh many of these guys are only mentioned in a few verses of Second Kings but there's one phrase that's repeated over and over and over of virtually every of one of the Kings of Israel we'll just read from one of them 2 Kings 15 and he could have been any of the various Kings in Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made Israel to sin a few of the kings of Judah did the same we read in in 2 Kings 16 about this particular king of Judah named ahaz ahaz walked in the way of the Kings of Israel yay ahaz made his son to pass through through the fire according to the Abominations of the Heathen whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel and he has sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every Green Tree going back to that chart you notice Jonah during the time there of jeroboam II Second Kings records a prophecy of Jonah that the Lord saved Israel by the hand of jeroboam too who was still another king who did a lot of bad stuff it says 2 Kings 14:25 that Jonah the son of amiti the Prophet could that be the same Jonah Jonah 1 now the word of the Lord came into Jonah the son of amiti yeah so this places Jonah and that book exact ly we know where it was when it was and he said arise go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me in this period we've seen Elisha healing non and anointing hezel to be a king to brutalize and Slaughter many of the descendants of Jacob now we have Jonah going to start a Revival in Nineveh Nineveh is the capital of Assyria they repent and only 37 years later God uses them to destroy the Northern Kingdom of Israel to depopulate it and Scatter the Israelites and then repopulate it with people from other places no wonder Jonah was reluctant to go there and not only for their extreme cruelty and brutality to those they conquered the the background image here I know it's a little hard to see and that's intentional is from a photo that I took when Heather and I were at the British museum about a year and a half ago in in London it's a detail of a bronze hinge on an Assyrian gate dating back to about 850 BC about a hundred years or so before Jonah went to Nineveh so what these guys did in Assyria was certainly well known the Assyrians were brutally cruel people you can see hands and feet and heads you can see a guy that's been tortured and he's impaled on a pole these were not nice people you did not want them to be your enemies and if they were your friends you wanted them to live in the next town wickedness well this chart again just to give you a little brief idea there's only Kings of Judah now because Israel has gone off into captivity I've circled my favorite one there his his name is Josiah in fact Heather and I named our Second Son Josiah a after this guy you'll notice under written prophets that there's seven names there n Jeremiah zephani habak Daniel Ezekiel Joel these this shows you where they were relative to the various Kings in Judah in time you can see the like for example nahem Jeremiah and Zephaniah were all prophesying at exactly the same time they overlapped all three of them were on the scene simultaneously anyway one thing when you're reading some of these other books you can refer back and say wait this was this period they were in Judah what was going on in Judah at that time it gives you context so you can help get a better idea when you see a person that writes a particular thing well what's the context where was he why was he saying that particular thing well this gives you that information um and and you can see there I I excerpted this from a place called www.bible.com talk about the books of first and 2 Chronicles we can focus on some of these people and the events that they influenced tonight I want to focus for a bit on this fellow jeroboam we keep reading he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made Israel to sin let let's examine this just a little bit what what's that somebody saying brother Lyall who was Jobo what was the sin thank you for asking we have to go back to First Kings for part of the answer we have been and we be reading a fair bit from First Kings this evening I realize this is a study of Second Kings but what happens in First Kings is planting the seed and nurturing it and it grows through second king until it comes to fruition so you can't really separate them this portion of First Kings occurs during the the reign of Solomon at at the start of the Rebellion near end of near the end of Solomon's life where he's starting to go the wrong way we read First Kings 11 jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite meaning that he was of the tribe of Ephraim of zaretta Solomon's servant whose mother's name was zarua a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king and this was the cause here's why he lifted up his hand against the king so we're going to get a little story here to tell you what was going on it says Solomon built Milo and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father now you built Milo you start looking on a map you're not going to find it what it means is he's rebuilding supporting Terraces and he's filling in the gaps in the wall so there's a construction crew that's going on fixing things up uh in the city of David which is at the edge of the city of Jerusalem and so we have this construction crew and it says the man jeroboam was a mighty man of Valor Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious made him ruler over all the charge of the House of Joseph the house of Joseph that's ephriam and manasse so here's this fellow that he's basically promoting him in this construction crew and he says hey you be the foreman you take care of this I can see that you've got you've got some Talent here you've got some Zeal you can make this happen we're doing Renovations here you can uh you can do a good job for me Solomon's observing the young man promoting him from within smart smart business well it it came to pass at that time in other words one time while this work was going on when Jobo went out of Jerusalem that the prophet aijah the shilonite which simply means he's from Shiloh he found him in the way and he aijah had Cloud himself in in a new garment he had a new cloak or or or or a new robe and they too were alone in the field and aija caught the new garment that was on them and rent it in 12 pieces I'm only going to do it once and he said to Jobo take 10 pieces for thus sayith the Lord the god of Israel behold I will Rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give 10 tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake the city which I have chosen of all the tribes of Israel now I know each one of you has said wait 12 and one 12 minus 10 is two not one what's going on well here's what's going on Simeon got left out of the math you can see this is how the territories were divided under Joshua that Judah has his big green territory Simeon is an island within the Sea of Judah so you can't have Simeon be part of Israel up there you're going to have a thing like we have now between Gaza and the West Bank it just doesn't work so Simeon is absorbed into the kingdom of Judah but it's not mentioned by name but that's why there's 12 tribes even though only 11 are mentioned I know that you were curious and you go home tonight you wouldn't sleep until you knew that answer so I just had to share that with you because this fellow aijah the shilonite goes on he says because pay close attention jeroboam listen here's why I'm taking the majority of the kingdom and giving it to you are you listening jeroboam I the Lord am doing this because that they the people under Solomon's leadership have forsaken me have worshiped Ash tth the goddess of the zidonians Kus the god of the moabites milham the god of the children of Ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as David Solomon's father did we'll skip down to verse 37 he says I will take thee and thou shalt Reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shall be king over Israel and it shall be are you listening jbone here's my condition I lay out plainly for you if thou wil hearken unto all that I command thee and Willl walk in my ways and do that which is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my Commandments as David my servant did that I will be with thee Jobo and build thee a sure house as I built for David and will give Israel unto thee I will for this afflict the seed of David but not forever well word of is gets back to the Palace Solomon therefore sought to kill jeroboam jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt unto shishak king of Egypt and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon we now know who jeroboam is jeroboam has his marching orders he'll be king over 10 of the 12 tribes of Israel God will secure his throne if he remains faithful to the Lord the one who is giving him this Authority he's a servant of Solomon he's not related after the kingdom is split we find out what the sin of jeroboam is the sin that caused the eventual destruction of the Kingdom the scattering of the people the seeds of destruction of both kingdoms Israel and Judah it's just as Paul tells us in Galatians be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man SWS that shall he also reap he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting the seed that was sown the sin of jeroboam First Kings 12:25 then jeroboam built shakam in Mount ephriam and dwelt therein and went out from fence and built penuel so he's got a construction program going on but Jobo said in his heart he he thought to himself now shall the kingdom return to the House of David maybe he didn't really believe what God had said if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord of Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rabam king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to reob King of Judah he's talking to himself he's listening to his imagination he's forgetting what he was told he's forgetting how he got there whereupon the king Jobo took counsel it's not only rabo that has bad counselors job's got some bad ones too and made two calves of gold oo and said unto the people it's too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought thee out of the land of Egypt golden calves golden calves we we'll get to maybe why those are golden calves in a moment so he said the one of these Cales as Idols in bethl bethl where Jacob thought God lived and the other he put in Dan so he's got one at the southern extreme of his kingdom and one at the northern extreme of his kingdom this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one and even unto Dan and he made a he jeroboam made a house of high places he set up shrines and temples on the peaks of the nearby Hills made priests of the lowest of the people which were not the sons of Levi it didn't stop there Jobo ordained a feast in the eighth month on the 15th day of the month like under the feast that is in Judah on the 15th day of the sth month the Feast of Tabernacles and he offered upon the altar so did he in bethl sacrificing under the Cales that he had made and he placed in bethl the priests of the high place Jes which he had made so he offered upon the altar which he' made in bethl the 15th day the eth month even in the month which he devised in his own heart his own imagination he made it up not only did he make up the guides he made up the feasts he made up the celebrations he invented the whole thing ordained a feast unto the children of Israel and he offered upon the Altar and burnt incense jeroboam after seeing the Fulfillment of the prophecy and obtaining a kingdom of precisely 10 tribes not nine not eight did exactly what he was told not to do and why golden calves again well where did he go when he was running from Solomon Egypt he was there for a number of years we saw in an exodus at the foot of the mountain where they worshiped a golden calf and you probably recall from the study that we did on Exodus that that hatur is one of their principal gods that they worship this goddess of lots of stuff is often represented as a cow so we've got complete circle going back again a guy goes to Egypt comes back with polluted ideas about religion and establishes his own thing and Embraces hotor what's the first of the 10 commandments Exodus 20 thou shalt have no other gods before me Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything in Heaven above or the Earth beneath or in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow thyself to them nor serve them and in Leviticus we read of a particular practice that the Lord hated Leviticus 18 Thou shalt not let any of thy seed thy children pass through the fire to mooch neither shalt thou profane the name of the Lord thy God I am the Lord another warning in Deuteronomy where the people are warned not to worship as a Canaanites worshiped Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God for every Abomination have they done unto their gods every Abomination to the Lord which he hateth have they done unto their gods even their sons and their daughters have they burnt and the fire to their gods pass through the fire we see then that jeroboam sin which the people followed and even the kings of Judah rated as good did not completely stop was idolatry including sacrificing their children this idol worship was centered at betel let's return to Second Kings I think the 17th chapter of Second Kings is a key to understanding what happened to Israel later to Judah and it's a flashing red light right warning Us in this place here and now we'll pick up the text he just described the sin of Israel the writer tells us yet the Lord testified against he warned Israel and against he warned Judah by all the prophets and by all the seers saying Turn ye from your evil ways keep my Commandments and my statutes according to all the laws I commanded your fathers which I have sent to you by my servants the prophets notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers and what's about their fathers that did not believe in the Lord their God they didn't do what he said because they didn't believe in him they ignored the command I I just choke over this they rejected his statutes his Covenant that he made with their fathers his testimonies his warnings which he testified against them and they followed vanity and that word means false gods emptiness falsehood and became vain became empty and they went after they followed the examples of the Heathen that were round about them concerning whom the Lord had charged them that they should not do like them they should not emulate those practices and they left they abandoned all the Commandments of the Lord their God and made them molted images even two calves and made a Grove and worshiped all the host of heaven and served ba all and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire this suggests at least some forms of human sacrifice not clearly stated but often strongly implied in the scriptures specifically called out as we read in Deuteronomy many translations of this verse say they sacrificed their sons and their daughters in the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold they gave themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight out of his presence there was none left but the tribe of Judah only this is referring to that conquest by Assyria whose capital city was Nineveh to whom Jonah had been only 37 years earlier but it doesn't stop there also Judah kept not the Commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made and the Lord rejected 10% oh the Lord rejected half no the Lord came to despise all the seed all the descendants of Israel and Afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight cast them from his presence for he rent he tore he violently removed Israel from the House of David and they made jeroboam the son of nebat King and jeroboam drave Israel from following the Lord and made them sin a great sin for the children of Israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did that he parted not from them until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight as he had said repeatedly warned that he would do by all his servants the prophets so was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day when we refer sometimes to the 10 lost tribes who referring to this captivity of Syria where they were depopulated and resettled elsewhere that's why Israel was destroyed what happened next is a solemn warning to me I think it's a solemn warning to us the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon from cah from Ava from Hamad from Safar rim and place him in the cities of Samaria instead of to replace the children of Israel and they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof sometimes we think in terms of dispensation Jewish dispensation we're part of the Gentile dispensation this looks a bit like something that's showing a gentile dispensation and it was so at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared and this term actually means worshiped they worshiped not the Lord therefore the Lord sent lines among them which killed some of them wherefore they they spake to the king of Assyria saying the Nations which thou Hast removed and placed in the cities of Samaria the people of the you've resettled us here but we don't know the manner of the god of the land therefore he sent Lions among them and and behold they're they're killing some of us because we don't know the manner of the god of the land we don't know the rules for worshiping the local deity there those days everybody had God in a box would don't put God in a box they had God in a box so if you're in this town you worship that God keep him happy and you'll get rain and you won't get too much lightning and and you over here you worship that God and the volcano won't erupt and but if you if you're over here and you worship that God the volcano might get you so you got to deal with this local deity you've got to have the the right box so what happens the king of Assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from then and and let them go and dwell there and teach them them the manner the the rules of worship of the god of the land send them there to teach him about the Lord then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in bethl and taught them how they should fear how they should Worship the Lord worship and rever how be it every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places the shrine on the Hills which the Samaritans the the people of Samaria in this case Israel not Samaritans as we think of had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt the men of Babylon made sakena the men of cth made nargal the men of hamat made Ashima it's a list of the various gods and Idols that uh that represented them and the aites mayis and tarac and the Safar ofit burnt their children in fire to adamik and Adamec the gods of the safaran so they worshiped the Lord they they worshiped the Lord and at the same time made Ender themselves of the lowest of them Priests of the high places which sacrific for them in the houses of the high places says they feared the Lord again meaning they Worship the Lord okay this guy told us we do this do the sacrifice whatever that's good and at the same time they served their own Gods after the manner of the Nations whom They Carried Away from then after their Customs until this day they do after their former manners they persist in their former practices they they fear not they don't truly or exclusively Worship the Lord neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob whom he named Israel skip a few verses down to 38 the Lord is rehearsing the things that he has commanded Israel and the Covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget neither shall you fear other gods worship other gods but the Lord your God shall ye fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies how be it they did not hearken but they did after their former manner they ignored the warning so these nations feared mixed worship of the Lord and served their graven images both their children and their children's children as did their fathers so do they ender this day notice that the new residents of the lands that had been Israel's were taught in the ways of the Lord they then had adapted and they adopted that worship as being to just a local God so they acknowledged that God while continuing and worshiping their own personal Gods if the musicians would come at this time reminds me a little bit of uh Rachel stealing her father's Idols clinging to the old even as she seemed to adopt Jacob's God what about us what about me is the Lord just one of the Gods in my life where do I spend my time where do I spend my energy what practices consume my life where are my thoughts to acknowledge Jesus is good it's necessary but it's not enough we must re recognize truly recognize our failure and inadequacy my sin the word means to miss the mark think of an Archer shooting an arrow maybe he hits the target but he misses the bull's eye that's literally what sin means is to miss the Mark I must acknowledge my sin I must truly repent in fact the Book of Revelation says in our age we should be zealous to repent that's not part of our modern culture of pluralism and inclusion and diversity we must be careful to not fall into the Trap of the Gentiles sent to Israel to replace Jacob's descendants by the king of Assyria to acknowledge the Lord but not to serve him singularly and wholeheartedly Heather if you'd come to not fall into the sin of jeroboam to not sacrifice our children not to the fire of intentional sacrifice but through failing to teach them failing to raise them to know the Lord that sacrificing your children to live the life before them not just to know about him that's just religion but to have relationship with him Heather is joining me to oh you've got the mic Heather's joining me to sing a song as we pass the service to our pastor it's a song about an event in Second Kings and about what we must do wasen with a rather dread disease so he sent for the man of of God to pray but Elisha said to non go dip yourself in Jordan and let the Cool Waters wash those spots away so non went down to the river of Jordan he waited right in the Rushing Water he dipped himself he dipped himself in the river of Jordan and the Cool Waters made him whole to the river of Jordan Our Savior went one day and the preacher John the Baptist met him there and when John baptized Jesus in the Jordan Rushing Waters the mighty power of God filled the air I'm going down river Jord going to wait right in the Rushing Water I'm going down going down to the river of Jordan and let the Cool Waters cleans my soul now the river of Jordan is many miles away and that Mighty River I might never see but I'll find an altar and with an oldfashioned prayer my river of Jordan that will be I'm on my way the river oford going to wait right in the rushing I'm going down I'm going down to the river of Jordan and let the Cool Waters cleans my soul I'm going down down going to wait right in I'm going down to the river of Jorden and let those Cool Waters cleanse my [Music] soul you know brother Li I was talking I was thinking he was he was talking about how each person they had a God here for this and a God here for that and and have you ever been to a Catholic bookstore it's exactly like that you can buy a little saint and and if you're trying to sell your house you bury him in the front yard and then it'll help you sell your house and then you have the patron saints you know traveled through Latin America you have the patron saint up in the in in some sort of a shrine for this little village and it might be Francis or it might be Peter it might be one of one of the different ones it's exactly what brother Lyall was talking about that wow it's so easy for idolatry to slip in just right into our lives so what we're going to do is brother Lyall and I were talking before service tonight and uh we thought it'd be a good idea to devote one of our services to questions and answers on on uh the the different books in the Bibles that we've already gone through now first and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles give they give a nice um a nice summary of a period of time I think I couldn't see your chart very good but I think Second Kings was about 300 years something like that yeah somewhere like that when we started um as brother Lyall said we started with with um the uh the death of Solomon there and and we go all the way through the end and we throw some prophets in there so right in the middle of the book we see the destruction of the North Country which was Israel he talked about Jonah going and uh being sent to neva which was in Assyria and then they come down and they destroy this country of Israel and disperse it and I think took a lot of them captive I think and then it goes on a little while longer and we see the same thing we see these Kings rise up we see I think around in chapter 18 we see Isaiah rise up and he starts prophesying and that's right around the book of Isaiah time goes on and then right at the end of the book of Second Kings there we see this guy come in named Nebuchadnezzar and he comes in and he destroys the remnant of what was left we had Judah in the South as as brother Lyle said Syria was they they destroyed that country in the north and repopulated it and took captive and then towards the end same thing happens just a few Kings later in Judah and we see Nebuchadnezzar we see the rise of him towards the end and it's so neat to me as you pointed out how all this during the Kings it's just chronological order and then we see these prophets come in we see Elijah come in we see Elisha come in we see Jona we see Isaiah we see these prophets they prophesy against the sin and against the Kings and and when like brother Lyall did when you can tie the two in it's just beautiful just great so start thinking about the questions that you might have let's go from Genesis to 2 Chronicles and and uh get get those questions together and then brother Lyall and I will devote a service to answering factual questions not doctrinal questions factual questions factual questions about from
