[16:40] [Music]
[16:59] you have that great desire for comfort
[17:03] for someone to have a headship over you
[17:06] because he placed that desire in you
[17:08] when you didn't even realize and know
[17:11] god had already placed that seed in you
[17:13] i appreciate that today we have a couple
[17:15] of requests here
[17:17] brother tony ramirez called
[17:20] and asked us to remember his son rudy
[17:23] they found his head he'd had pain in his
[17:25] neck
[17:27] and his back and area and he thought
[17:29] maybe he was having a heart attack or
[17:31] something she went in for a scan and
[17:33] they found out he had stenosis which is
[17:35] the closing of the
[17:38] of the veins and stuff so but brother
[17:40] tony said ask god to deal with his soul
[17:42] deal with his heart so
[17:44] we would do that
[17:45] [Music]
[17:46] brother ed
[17:48] douglas that we remember francois and
[17:50] his wife
[17:52] this week they'll be going over to
[17:53] jordan
[17:55] and to istanbul they have contacts over
[17:57] there and that's those are muslim
[17:59] especially their countries
[18:01] and their so
[18:02] just remember them and
[18:04] in prayer as they go there's something
[18:06] in your heart
[18:08] that drives you to to do these things
[18:10] not because you want to go over there
[18:12] and it's not a sight scene and a tour in
[18:15] a vacation let's go and
[18:18] see if you can't just
[18:20] give somebody that that hope of life in
[18:22] them so
[18:23] if you have a need
[18:26] say lord i have a need you know what
[18:28] that need is
[18:29] sometimes i can't even put it in words
[18:31] so

[18:34] our hands

[18:42] you ask us to believe you ask as you say
[18:45] ask
[18:46] and you say if you say to this mountain
[18:48] lord and sometimes we we want to see you
[18:50] come and do some lord but you're asking
[18:52] us to take it by faith and believe it
[18:54] today lord so you
[18:56] for rudy lord we've known him and since
[18:58] he was just a young boy lord and he's
[19:00] drawn cold and away from the lord
[19:03] but you hear daddy and mama's request
[19:05] for their son lord and their daughter
[19:07] debbie lord that you would reach out to
[19:08] them lord maybe this be a way
[19:11] that they would turn their hearts back
[19:12] to you lord and our brother francois and
[19:14] his wife as they travel lord and
[19:17] lord they put themselves in danger lord

[30:03] i thought for sure it'd be two or three
[30:04] songs
[30:06] amen
[30:09] it's it's it's good to hear the young
[30:11] people testify
[30:12] to sing
[30:14] to worship the lord
[30:16] you know and that's following the in the
[30:18] footprints of godly parents
[30:21] those it carries it goes down we
[30:24] we get to talking about it sometime and
[30:26] we praise god and thank god for the
[30:28] godly heritage that he's given us amen
[30:32] amen so
[30:34] brother craig i'm going to call you up
[30:35] and just
[30:37] share a few words
[30:38] i know you're on vacation so just
[30:40] keeping vacation time
[30:43] just
[30:46] you know something more than i do huh
[30:49] just come up and share some of someone's
[30:51] heart so
[30:52] i appreciate that thank you
[30:56] well i certainly didn't expect this
[30:59] but we're believers
[31:01] and we're taught to be instant in season
[31:03] out of season
[31:05] and every day that goes by we wake up in
[31:07] the morning we dedicate that day to the
[31:09] lord we say lord look where you brought
[31:12] me from without my help you reached down
[31:15] and you found me and you plucked me out
[31:17] and god sheds his light upon our
[31:19] footsteps as we walk
[31:22] and it's a journey
[31:23] and every one of us comes from a
[31:25] different walk of life but we all have
[31:27] this in common one day god came by
[31:31] and every one of us had whatever life it
[31:33] was or wherever we come from it forever
[31:36] changed our life
[31:38] and sometimes our young people they may
[31:40] take for granted the truth that we
[31:43] that that we have you know that they
[31:45] have come into maybe grown up listening
[31:47] to
[31:48] been raised in truth
[31:50] but i say it's just as much of a miracle
[31:53] for god to keep them
[31:56] as it is to transform someone's life and
[31:59] overhaul their life from alcohol and
[32:01] and so forth then the keeping power of
[32:04] almighty god
[32:06] so whatever way you come
[32:08] we can only say is the grace of god
[32:11] we're thankful for that
[32:13] and so i want to encourage you in your
[32:15] walk
[32:16] because i know that life is full of ups
[32:18] and downs
[32:20] i tell my wife sometimes i said you know
[32:22] and i'm not against facebook but
[32:24] facebook is only shows one side
[32:28] brother branham said the bible shows
[32:29] both sides
[32:31] the bible never failed to show david's
[32:34] mistakes
[32:35] and peter's mistakes and moses failures
[32:39] abraham's failures samson's failures and
[32:43] you know we can relate to that
[32:45] did you know that uh brother branham had
[32:48] 30 i think it was bosworth that said
[32:50] brother branham had 30 to 40 visions a
[32:52] day
[32:55] 30 to 40 visions a day that's not that's
[32:58] not you know counting his praying for
[33:00] the sake he don't know whether he's in
[33:02] this dimension or the next dimension
[33:06] and we we can't relate to that i don't
[33:09] know anyone else in the world that had
[33:11] 30 to 40 visions a day
[33:13] but we can relate to a time where
[33:15] brother branham gets under pressure and
[33:17] tells a lie under pressure
[33:20] but you know he didn't have to tell us
[33:24] he could have hid that and stood
[33:27] 20 foot tall in our eyes
[33:29] but he came to the pulpit because he
[33:31] wasn't afraid of being real
[33:34] and he wasn't afraid to give god the
[33:36] credit
[33:37] and say you know what i made a mistake
[33:40] and when he repented he said i wept like
[33:43] a baby prayed for three hours and said i
[33:45] wept like a baby
[33:47] and he said god if you forgive me will
[33:49] you come by my way
[33:51] and he said he looked and here come a
[33:52] whirlwind through the remote woods no
[33:55] one is around and you think no one in
[33:56] the world cares and god come down
[33:59] through that woods like a whirlwind he
[34:01] said i wept like a baby
[34:06] we can relate to the humanity
[34:09] and the frailty we read in the bible
[34:12] and we can relate i thank god this
[34:14] message showed both sides
[34:17] he's showing no matter who you are that
[34:19] there is a place that the grace of god
[34:22] has provided
[34:24] and furthermore brother branham said we
[34:26] are without excuse
[34:28] because god's grace is so great he can
[34:31] rise us above circumstances he can rise
[34:34] us above our sickness he can rise us
[34:37] above our own selves
[34:40] and we can thank god for that
[34:43] but the real life is the ups and the
[34:46] downs
[34:49] that's real life
[34:51] every one of us know that that is true
[34:53] one day you're up one day you are down
[34:56] and sometimes veils of darkness fall
[34:59] upon our lives and trials are real and
[35:01] trials go for weeks and months and even
[35:04] years
[35:07] but god remains constant
[35:10] and if we will believe with all of our
[35:12] hearts the clouds will disperse and the
[35:14] sun is still shining
[35:17] i love what john said he said he shined
[35:20] like the sun shineth in its strength
[35:23] that's what he saw in the church ages
[35:25] and we know the church ages was full of
[35:27] dark ages we know that the church ages
[35:30] was full of antichrist spirits and
[35:32] church splits and all kinds of chaos but
[35:35] when john saw him he said he was shining
[35:37] in his strength
[35:40] amen so brother branham told us that
[35:42] even when the clouds are covering that
[35:45] the sun is still shining
[35:47] don't that make you happy
[35:49] when you're sick the sun is still
[35:50] shining when you're depressed the sun is
[35:53] still shining when the church is in
[35:56] turmoil the sun is still shining and in
[35:59] its power and its glory and its strength
[36:04] hallelujah
[36:06] god's word is still true
[36:08] praise the mighty name of the lord
[36:11] and i know you all been going for a
[36:13] trial going through a trial for a long
[36:15] time
[36:16] but i want to tell you that god's power
[36:18] is still shining
[36:20] hold your head up like christians
[36:23] amen it is not our confidence in us it's
[36:26] our confidence in him who will not fail
[36:29] us
[36:30] and i want to encourage you tonight
[36:32] all of us go through trials and
[36:35] sometimes trials are long
[36:38] have confidence in god
[36:40] none of us has went 25 years like
[36:42] abraham yet
[36:44] and one day it was all today together
[36:46] different
[36:48] you remember brother branham said that
[36:49] about is this all right
[36:51] brother branham i'm sorry
[36:54] [Laughter]
[36:56] i did not intend for this so brother
[36:58] bradham said that abraham
[37:01] he said he'd get up say honey how you

[37:35] amen that god is going to answer our
[37:37] prayers god is going to have his way in
[37:39] our life god is going to bring our
[37:41] children back
[37:42] god is going to give us a revival god is
[37:45] going to answer
[37:47] hallelujah he's going to do it because
[37:49] he promised it
[37:50] god give us that confidence don't look
[37:53] at the weakness don't look at the
[37:55] valleys keep your eye on the sun that is
[37:58] always shining
[38:00] when it's raining the sun is still
[38:02] shining in our trials the sun is still
[38:05] shining
[38:06] amen and even when we're in hurting
[38:08] times the sun is still shining
[38:12] tucson tabernacle the sun is shining
[38:14] bright and it is power and in his
[38:18] strength

[43:34] how sufficient it is lord
[43:36] as we had heard even when the
[43:39] when the storms all around the sun is
[43:41] still shining shining forth radiating
[43:44] the glory of the almighty the one who
[43:45] formed it and fashioned it
[43:47] there's a tight lord that no matter what
[43:49] we go through in life
[43:51] you're always there you're always
[43:52] present you're always mindful father
[43:55] what a grace we've experienced a little
[43:57] mercy

[44:20] you
[44:21] brother ed good to have you in service
[44:23] with us tonight god bless you
[44:25] amen
[44:27] we're going to look here once again
[44:29] in hebrews 13 and verse
[44:32] hebrews 13 and verse 8. and i want to
[44:34] pick back up on this thought that we
[44:35] were this morning and there's going to
[44:37] be some things that you may hear again
[44:40] i think many of us as learners
[44:42] sometimes we have to hear things
[44:44] multiple times before we finally catch
[44:45] the inspiration or case the significance
[44:48] of it for it to really settle in our
[44:50] minds so there's going to be some things
[44:52] that were said you will say brother joe
[44:53] well you mentioned that already this
[44:55] morning well just hang tight and let
[44:57] your spirit anoint that same word and
[44:59] maybe this time it won't go over your
[45:01] head but it'll come into your mind drop
[45:02] down into your heart and begin to
[45:04] produce the life in which we believe
[45:05] that it can but we find here in hebrews
[45:08] in 13 and verse 8 jesus christ is the
[45:11] same yesterday
[45:13] today
[45:15] and forever all right god bless you you
[45:17] can have your seats this evening and i'd
[45:19] like to speak to you as we just
[45:21] mentioned
[45:22] jesus christ the same today but i want
[45:24] to give this a sub topic
[45:26] of what are you going to do
[45:29] i love brother aaron didn't know and i'd
[45:31] been praying for the mind of god for the
[45:32] service but in his prayer
[45:35] he actually brought out he said many
[45:37] times we're waiting on god
[45:39] to do something
[45:42] it's you and i as believers who are
[45:44] waiting on god but god is waiting on us
[45:50] and if we can catch the significance of
[45:52] that tonight i believe our lives will be
[45:54] transformed
[45:55] god is waiting on us so my question to
[45:58] tucson tabernacle
[46:00] at this thanksgiving season what are you
[46:03] going to do
[46:05] not as a church body but as an
[46:07] individual believer
[46:09] what are you going to do how are you
[46:10] going to believe what are you going to
[46:12] believe
[46:13] you know brother craig didn't mention
[46:14] his church that he just recently took
[46:16] there in connecticut was a church and
[46:18] this is all free
[46:19] now i'll start my time clock
[46:21] but his church was without a pastor for
[46:23] a long time as well
[46:26] he and i went in faithfully week after
[46:28] week after week month after month after
[46:30] month for a couple years going back and
[46:32] forth with other ministries
[46:34] going there to be a support to the
[46:35] believers until finally god began to
[46:38] move on brother craig's heart to leave
[46:40] louisiana to
[46:42] where her
[46:43] his wife's family's from and our family
[46:45] and to go and take this little church
[46:47] because
[46:48] god has a shepherd for the sheep
[46:51] and i believe that if you keep believing
[46:53] and quit looking at and everything
[46:56] that's going on and every you know maybe
[46:58] there's dissension in the church this
[47:00] one don't agree with that and this one
[47:01] don't agree with that but if we can just
[47:02] focus this evening on god fulfilling his
[47:06] word lord we don't want to just be a
[47:08] church that is sustained by ministry
[47:10] after ministry after ministry lord send
[47:12] us a shepherd send us one who has a
[47:15] burden for the people has a burden for
[47:18] my needs has a burden for my family has
[47:21] a burden for this area and if you begin
[47:23] to pray that way and pray relentlessly
[47:26] that way god will begin to move on that
[47:29] brother's heart on that family's heart
[47:31] and god will begin to move and bring
[47:34] that that pastor that shepherd to meet
[47:37] the needs of the local assembly
[47:40] i've seen god do it
[47:42] and now that congregation that was about
[47:44] 40 to 50 now begins to grow and blossom
[47:47] because god had a shepherd
[47:50] and so many times we don't understand
[47:52] the will of god in our lives because
[47:53] we're in the midst of the storm but if
[47:55] we can ever take a step back from the
[47:57] storm maybe get up a little bit higher
[47:59] and look down and maybe you can see the
[48:01] rationale by which god is doing things
[48:04] because god doesn't do anything by
[48:06] mistake let me just tell you this god
[48:08] doesn't make a mistake
[48:10] how many of you know the story of corey
[48:12] ten boone corey ten boone said it over
[48:15] and over and over and over even in her
[48:17] captivity when she was in a
[48:19] concentration camp being worked
[48:21] miserably by the nazi army she confessed
[48:25] daily god doesn't make mistakes and
[48:28] there's not one of you here this evening
[48:30] that has been in a concentration camp
[48:32] there is one of you there's not one of
[48:34] you here this evening that is going
[48:36] without bread going without water going
[48:38] without substance and yet god doesn't
[48:41] make mistakes
[48:43] god allowed this poor lady
[48:46] to go through a life of misery at the
[48:48] hand of a nazi army and yet it won
[48:51] millions and millions and millions to
[48:54] the lord
[48:56] because god doesn't make mistakes he's
[48:58] faithful
[49:00] she could have turned her back on god
[49:03] she could have walked away and said it's
[49:05] nothing if god loved me then god would
[49:07] bring me out of this he wouldn't put me
[49:09] through this but sometimes we can't see
[49:12] the tender hand of jehovah for what it
[49:15] is
[49:16] because all we see is the trial now this
[49:18] is not in my notes so i don't even know
[49:19] why i'm going there but many times all
[49:21] we see is the trial all we see is a
[49:24] disappointment all we see is the chaos
[49:27] and yet god sees his hand moving and
[49:30] molding and shaping and forming a
[49:33] situation and bringing a local assembly
[49:35] closer and closer and closer
[49:39] for the ripen
[49:41] because he knows what he has in store
[49:44] for this local body
[49:46] now we find here in luke in verse 4 and
[49:48] chapter 17
[49:50] this is jesus speaking because we're
[49:52] going to look here this evening at the
[49:54] gospel
[49:55] i think we've got to have a better
[49:57] understanding of what the gospel is
[50:00] and the bible would tell us and there
[50:02] was delivered unto him the book of the
[50:04] prophet isaiah's
[50:06] and when he had opened the book he had
[50:08] found the place where it was written
[50:10] that the spirit of the lord is upon me
[50:12] because he hath anointed me to preach
[50:16] the gospel
[50:18] to preach it to the poor he has sent me
[50:21] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[50:23] deliverance to the captive the
[50:24] recovering of the sight to the blind and
[50:27] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[50:30] now jesus found his place in the word
[50:34] now if he was to find his place in the
[50:37] word shouldn't you and i find our place
[50:41] he says to preach the acceptable year of
[50:44] the lord and he closed the book and he
[50:46] gave it again to the minister and he sat
[50:49] down and the eyes of all them that were
[50:51] in the synagogue were fastened on him
[50:54] and he began to say unto them this day
[50:58] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[51:01] your ears
[51:03] i'm here to tell you tucson tabernacle
[51:05] god is gonna have a bride
[51:08] and she's gonna be the very
[51:10] manifestation of the word and there's
[51:13] gotta be somebody that would rise up and
[51:16] say this day
[51:17] this scripture has been fulfilled in
[51:20] your ears
[51:22] lord you declared you're going to have a
[51:24] bride you're going to have a people
[51:25] without spot without wrinkle without
[51:28] blemish lord i stand in an honor tonight
[51:31] as that recipient of that word that i
[51:33] know who i am i know where god has
[51:36] called me i know what god has done in my
[51:38] life i'm not a vagabond i'm not a
[51:40] wayward person but i'm a sean and a
[51:42] daughter of god i know my position i
[51:45] know my calling i know i've been
[51:47] annoying it i know i've been elected and
[51:49] here i am lord to rise to the challenge
[51:51] that i know my place in the scriptures
[51:54] and i'm here at laodicea to testify that
[51:57] god is god and god will never change
[52:01] oh i'm here to tell you he's the same
[52:02] god for tucson tabernacle as he is an
[52:05] even like tabernacle as he is for upper
[52:07] ground tabernacle he's the same god
[52:09] tonight
[52:13] he's the same god and we find he said
[52:16] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[52:21] because i've been anointed to preach the
[52:23] gospel then we find him mark 16
[52:26] notice mark 16 and verse 15
[52:28] and he said unto them now this is jesus
[52:31] speaking it's read a letter in my bible
[52:34] and he tells them go you into all the
[52:36] world and preach the gospel
[52:38] to every creature
[52:41] now in luke 4
[52:43] we find that he's been anointed to
[52:45] preach the gospel
[52:47] not that he didn't declare this and keep
[52:49] it to himself
[52:50] that i'm the only one that can do this
[52:53] but we find in mark 16 he commands the
[52:56] followers his followers that you go into
[52:59] all the world and i want you to preach
[53:02] the gospel i want you to declare the
[53:04] very same thing that i preached that
[53:07] i've been anointed with that i've been
[53:08] anointed for i want you to witness the
[53:11] same thing
[53:12] because he didn't just keep him to
[53:14] himself he didn't just draw everybody to
[53:16] himself says i'm the only one he says no
[53:19] i'm the truth and the way and the life
[53:21] but i want you to go forth and exemplify
[53:24] who i am
[53:26] and that i've called you for this
[53:27] purpose i've called you into this
[53:29] ministry and i want you to declare the
[53:31] gospel
[53:34] so jesus is declaring and commanding his
[53:37] followers
[53:38] to go and do the very same thing that he
[53:42] did
[53:44] go and preach the gospel go and heal the
[53:47] brokenhearted
[53:48] go and bring deliverance to the captive
[53:50] go and give sight to the blind go and
[53:53] set at liberty those that are brewed go
[53:55] out there and declare this word to be
[53:57] true
[53:58] you find people today they they don't
[54:00] want you to sing only believe
[54:03] because that was brother branham's song
[54:04] that wasn't brother brown song that's
[54:06] our song
[54:10] they don't want you to lay hands on the
[54:11] sick that was brother brannan's ministry
[54:13] that's not brother branham's ministry
[54:15] that's god's ministry
[54:17] he anointed for that purpose
[54:20] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[54:22] recover that's the truth or it's not the
[54:24] truth
[54:26] but i'm here to declare to you it's the
[54:27] word of god
[54:29] and we have been anointed brother
[54:31] brother uh craig and brother aaron and
[54:32] myself we have been anointed and you
[54:35] have been anointed to lay hands on the
[54:37] sick
[54:38] it's not just for the ministry it's for
[54:40] them that will believe
[54:42] and if i can get you to believe tonight
[54:45] nothing will stand before that prayer
[54:48] notice now in the in the church ages i
[54:51] love what the prophet of god says here
[54:53] he says now remember this that christ in
[54:56] the true church is a continuation of the
[55:00] book of acts
[55:02] does anybody want to take a guess how
[55:03] they acted in the book of acts
[55:06] oh brother joe that's not us
[55:10] we don't do that
[55:11] think about the upper room experience
[55:14] they got there and they waited
[55:18] maybe it started off real quiet kind of
[55:20] like it is right here tonight
[55:22] and they waited
[55:24] and some of them probably looked at
[55:26] their clock well he's been 12 minutes my
[55:27] goodness will he hurry up where's he
[55:29] going with this thought tonight
[55:31] and they waited and one day pass and two
[55:34] days pass and this one passed and it
[55:36] passed and it passed and it passed
[55:39] but finally
[55:41] what he told them to go you into the
[55:43] city of jerusalem and you'll wait and
[55:45] you'll be endued with power from on high
[55:48] you go and do what i said and if we can
[55:50] do what he says today the same promise
[55:52] that rested upon them will come down to
[55:54] this church and rest upon each and every
[55:57] believer here tonight
[55:59] because he's the same god
[56:04] notice now
[56:05] he says
[56:07] that christ in the true church is a
[56:10] continuation
[56:12] of the book of acts
[56:14] see we're not starting over
[56:17] the book of acts
[56:18] we're not going back at the very
[56:20] beginning of this and have to go into
[56:21] the upper room and start it all over
[56:23] we're not repeating the book of acts we
[56:25] are the continuation
[56:27] of the book of acts see our hearts have
[56:30] been turned back to pentecost
[56:33] not to start all over but to be
[56:37] returned back to pentecost that we can
[56:39] continue where pentecost left where
[56:41] pentecost failed at the nazi and council
[56:44] when they walked away from the true word
[56:46] of god god had brought us back to that
[56:48] place so that his end time people will
[56:50] be the continuation the same god that
[56:53] they serve is the same god that we serve
[56:55] the same power that they possess is the
[56:57] same power in which we possess the same
[57:00] anointing the same healing the same
[57:02] delivers in which they went forth and
[57:04] declared it's the same power that we go
[57:06] forth and declare
[57:08] it's a continuation of the book of acts
[57:13] blinded eyes become open
[57:16] frail bodies become well
[57:19] oh my we have been commissioned
[57:22] to preach
[57:24] the gospel that doesn't mean that
[57:26] everybody here tonight are going to come
[57:28] and stand behind this pulpit
[57:29] but what it does mean is every one of
[57:31] you are going to declare
[57:33] you're going to demonstrate
[57:35] that the word is reality
[57:39] because while the word is manifesting
[57:41] clearly through your life
[57:44] see what we do is we allow the word to
[57:46] produce
[57:47] in our lives and through our lives
[57:49] exactly what it says it will do
[57:52] when the word says you can have your
[57:53] offspring there's a people that believe
[57:56] that
[57:56] no matter where they are in life no
[57:59] matter how astray they are they believe
[58:02] that and what happens is when they put
[58:04] that faith out there god begins to grab
[58:07] hold of that faith and god begins to go
[58:09] after him and look you remember the
[58:11] story where there was a young lady and
[58:13] she went insane and lost her mind and
[58:15] she was an insane institution and the
[58:17] prophet of god went in there and he said
[58:18] you used to call me brother bill and we
[58:20] know that story and he said he had to go
[58:22] and catch her spirit because her spirit
[58:25] left her body but the problem of god
[58:28] went out and caught that spirit and
[58:29] brought it back to that young girl and
[58:31] with just a few minutes she was back in
[58:33] our right mind i'm going to declare it
[58:35] to you church he's the same god tonight
[58:37] and that same god can go to your child
[58:39] and catch that spirit and bring that
[58:41] spirit right back into that body and
[58:43] bring them into the manifestation of
[58:45] sons and daughters of god
[58:49] don't look at their situation don't look
[58:52] at their waywardness don't look at the
[58:54] chaos that surrounds their life look to
[58:56] the promise
[59:00] in the body of believers this evening
[59:03] there is healing
[59:05] brother ed you testify of a god that
[59:07] heals
[59:08] sister rachel you testify of a god that
[59:11] heals
[59:14] so in the in the body of believers this
[59:16] evening there is healing there is
[59:18] discernment there is deliverance to the
[59:19] captive there is liberty to those that
[59:22] are bruised
[59:23] and see what christ manifested in the
[59:25] alpha church
[59:27] we are to manifest in the omega church
[59:31] nothing more
[59:32] and absolutely nothing less
[59:35] the same word the same anointing the
[59:38] same signs the same wonders
[59:40] well brother joey that means we all got
[59:42] to speak in tongues that's a pentecostal
[59:43] doctrine i'm not saying that but don't
[59:45] when the holy spirit comes by and you
[59:47] feel moved to speak in tongues don't you
[59:50] stop the movement of the spirit
[59:52] many times we sat through a service and
[59:54] i have a i'll be honest with you he said
[59:56] to us i sit on the platform so all eyes
[59:59] are on us
[1:00:00] and man sometimes the spirit of god
[1:00:02] begins to move and i feel like running
[1:00:05] but like i can't run i'm on the platform
[1:00:08] i feel like dancing and there's times i
[1:00:10] let go and just dance in the spirit
[1:00:12] but we feel like we feel the movement of
[1:00:14] the spirit how many have ever felt the
[1:00:15] movement of the spirit and you just sit
[1:00:16] there and go on
[1:00:22] but we shall open ourselves up
[1:00:26] there's nothing to be ashamed of
[1:00:30] what happened
[1:00:31] is when this message
[1:00:34] moved on past pentecost azuza
[1:00:37] the ministry began to preach so hard
[1:00:39] against the movement the emotion
[1:00:41] and what they failed to realize is god
[1:00:43] was still there
[1:00:45] and then they just capped on the word
[1:00:47] the word the word the word the word the
[1:00:49] word to work until people sit there
[1:00:54] because all we're doing is just
[1:00:55] preaching an intellectual word
[1:00:58] we want
[1:00:59] a god
[1:01:00] with life in them
[1:01:02] look i want a message that's got life in
[1:01:04] it i want something that packs power i
[1:01:06] don't want to go to church and be put to
[1:01:08] sleep by some dry eyed man sitting up
[1:01:10] there just sharing this thought and that
[1:01:12] thought before you get it you trying to
[1:01:13] tie all these thoughts together and just
[1:01:15] don't know where in the world it ties at
[1:01:18] i've heard a man preach before back when
[1:01:20] i was first in the message and man he
[1:01:22] was he had a big name and he was so
[1:01:24] intellectual and man he came in and he
[1:01:26] did this and and i sat there like man i
[1:01:28] was better off not even coming to church
[1:01:30] that night
[1:01:31] he had me so messed up i'm thinking i
[1:01:33] don't even know where if i'm even a
[1:01:34] christian
[1:01:36] but give me a basic simple gospel where
[1:01:39] god becomes alive in a people
[1:01:41] when that word when they recognize this
[1:01:43] is who i am that god has called me as
[1:01:45] here to manifest himself that's what
[1:01:47] we're looking for tonight we're not
[1:01:49] looking for intellectual understanding
[1:01:50] god's not expecting you to be able to
[1:01:52] recite quotes and this that and the
[1:01:54] other of the church age book and the
[1:01:56] seven seals all you got to realize
[1:01:57] tonight is god doesn't change and god's
[1:02:00] the same yesterday and he's the same
[1:02:02] today and he's wanting you to do
[1:02:03] something about it
[1:02:04] he's wanting you to declare to this
[1:02:06] godless sinful generation that he's the
[1:02:09] same and he changes not
[1:02:11] that his word will not fail if you take
[1:02:13] god at his word heavens and earth will
[1:02:15] pass away but that word will become
[1:02:17] anointed and it'll come to life in your
[1:02:19] life
[1:02:22] notice now in the body of believers
[1:02:26] there's healing
[1:02:28] discernment deliverance
[1:02:30] deliverance to the captive
[1:02:32] set at liberty those that are bruised
[1:02:34] see christ doesn't change he's the same
[1:02:37] the brother of them will say this in the
[1:02:38] message possessing the enemy's gates in
[1:02:40] the church of the living god this
[1:02:41] morning lays the power to heal all
[1:02:44] sickness
[1:02:46] all sickness in the church of the living
[1:02:49] god lays the power to overcome all
[1:02:52] temptation
[1:02:53] don't tell me that there's a temptation
[1:02:55] that's bigger than you it may be bigger
[1:02:57] than you but it's not bigger than the
[1:02:58] god that we serve
[1:03:00] some of you young boys you struggle with
[1:03:02] pornography and you struggle with this
[1:03:03] and you struggle with that but i want
[1:03:05] you to know tonight i declare that jesus
[1:03:07] christ is ashamed today and he's bigger
[1:03:10] than your addiction he's bigger than
[1:03:12] your problem he can break that thing off
[1:03:14] of your life he's the same god
[1:03:17] i can testify i know what god has done
[1:03:19] in my life i've seen god come and break
[1:03:22] that yoke off of me and if he can do it
[1:03:24] for me he can do it for you
[1:03:26] not just for the young boys it's for
[1:03:28] some of us parents
[1:03:30] hiding behind a message hiding behind
[1:03:32] this and you got sin in your life it's
[1:03:34] time that we can become clean and let
[1:03:35] god move and move all the sin out of our
[1:03:38] lives
[1:03:41] in the church of the living god lays the
[1:03:44] power to overcome all temptation
[1:03:49] him the possession of the church of the
[1:03:50] living god this morning lays the power
[1:03:53] to change sin where sin had you chained
[1:03:57] now you can change sin and throw it away
[1:04:00] and you can receive the baptism of the
[1:04:02] holy ghost in the church of jesus christ
[1:04:05] where sin used to have you in bondage
[1:04:07] now you can take it and bind the head of
[1:04:09] the serpent
[1:04:11] oh my
[1:04:14] whatsoever you desire
[1:04:17] whatsoever you ask in my name he says i
[1:04:20] will give it to you
[1:04:23] see
[1:04:24] we find in mark 16 and verse 14 he said
[1:04:26] unto him go
[1:04:28] go into all the world and preach the
[1:04:30] gospel
[1:04:31] declare the gospel to every creature
[1:04:36] and he that believeth is baptized shall
[1:04:38] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:04:41] be damned
[1:04:42] and these signs
[1:04:45] shall
[1:04:46] follow
[1:04:48] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:04:50] cast out devils
[1:04:54] been there
[1:04:55] and have done that
[1:04:57] because no evil spirit can stand before
[1:04:59] an anointed of god
[1:05:01] when the people are ready for
[1:05:02] deliverance brother baby said you can
[1:05:04] see the countenance on their face begin
[1:05:06] to change because that enemy knows he's
[1:05:09] about to be exposed and he has to leave
[1:05:12] we've been there we've done this
[1:05:14] the same god
[1:05:16] that cast out devils on the shores of
[1:05:18] galilee that walked through capernaum
[1:05:20] that walked the shores i walked the
[1:05:22] lands there he's the same god today
[1:05:25] he showed up the devil showed up brother
[1:05:26] craig and i
[1:05:28] at a youth meeting we had back a couple
[1:05:29] years back and there was a sister that
[1:05:31] came in and she had an evil spirit upon
[1:05:33] her and she began to move like a snake
[1:05:36] and just my goodness it would just put
[1:05:38] chills over you if you didn't know your
[1:05:40] position in the body
[1:05:42] and the me and brother craig faced off
[1:05:44] with this spirit and it took hours it
[1:05:46] wasn't something you just played with
[1:05:47] but we recognized we learned a lot sir
[1:05:50] sometimes you can't do it all in front
[1:05:52] of everybody because why because there's
[1:05:53] doubt here and there's confusion here
[1:05:55] and people don't understand the true
[1:05:57] word of god so we took this system with
[1:06:00] her husband and took her to a back room
[1:06:02] and began to work with her begin to deal
[1:06:03] with her and we found brother craig
[1:06:06] found the key that broke that yoke off
[1:06:08] of her and in a moment's time she began
[1:06:10] to look up she goes i see angels all
[1:06:12] around let me tell you church her eyes
[1:06:14] became off of this dimension and she
[1:06:16] began to look at another dimension she
[1:06:18] began to see jesus christ was real that
[1:06:21] jesus christ is the same he's the same
[1:06:23] today and this anointing that had her
[1:06:25] bound for so many years it broke off of
[1:06:28] her and she's free today
[1:06:30] she's never been back to that she's
[1:06:32] never been bound again
[1:06:34] because god's word is the same for you
[1:06:37] tonight as much as it was for the the
[1:06:40] the disciples in the book of acts
[1:06:43] notice in verse 19 so then after the
[1:06:45] lord had spoken unto them
[1:06:47] he was received up into heaven they sat
[1:06:49] on the right hand
[1:06:50] and they went forth
[1:06:54] and they preached everywhere
[1:06:57] notice the lord working with them
[1:07:00] and confirming the word
[1:07:03] with signs
[1:07:05] following
[1:07:08] not doctrines
[1:07:10] not ideas
[1:07:12] not great thoughts
[1:07:14] but signs
[1:07:17] if i came here last time i was here and
[1:07:19] told you that god's a healer and brother
[1:07:22] ed you came in that prayer line and
[1:07:24] you're still sick in the body
[1:07:26] down in your back
[1:07:28] and god didn't heal you
[1:07:30] sister rachel
[1:07:33] in the back there
[1:07:34] god didn't touch you
[1:07:36] different ones that came
[1:07:38] god wouldn't have manifested himself to
[1:07:40] you
[1:07:41] you can say well brother joe you're just
[1:07:43] pipe dreams and air castles
[1:07:46] but when god comes by
[1:07:48] and he becomes a reality
[1:07:51] and he fulfills what his word declares
[1:07:53] that he will do and he will do it
[1:07:55] because the people believe that he's
[1:07:58] going to do these things
[1:08:00] then you'll see a man who's been down 40
[1:08:03] years with back issues be able to bend
[1:08:05] over
[1:08:06] put his shoes on and his socks on and be
[1:08:08] pain-free you'll see a daughter of god
[1:08:10] who's dealt with gluten problems and
[1:08:12] different issues for years and years and
[1:08:14] years who has sat through a service with
[1:08:15] stomach cramps and different things be
[1:08:17] completely set free and not be bound not
[1:08:21] be having any issues till this day
[1:08:25] i'm preaching to you about a living god
[1:08:27] i'm not talking to you about a
[1:08:28] historical artifact i'm not talking to
[1:08:30] you about a god that's in the history
[1:08:32] books i'm talking to you about a god
[1:08:33] that's the same
[1:08:36] today he's the same today these signs
[1:08:39] shall follow them that believe
[1:08:41] preach the gospel unto all the world and
[1:08:43] these signs shall follow them everywhere
[1:08:47] the same sign the same gospel we preach
[1:08:49] he goes we have tracts passed out all
[1:08:51] over the world but the gospel hasn't
[1:08:53] been preaching to a third of it yet the
[1:08:55] gospel is not just the word only
[1:08:58] but it's the word made manifest
[1:09:02] the power and the demonstration of the
[1:09:04] holy spirit bringing the word to pass
[1:09:08] now we know we can quote over and over
[1:09:10] and over and over
[1:09:11] that how do you know that a prophet is a
[1:09:13] prophet
[1:09:14] by when he prophesies anything if that
[1:09:16] word comes to pass then he's a
[1:09:18] vindicated prophet
[1:09:21] am i correct
[1:09:22] then how do you know that you're a
[1:09:23] believer
[1:09:26] oh my
[1:09:28] oh
[1:09:30] let me tell you how
[1:09:31] when signs follow your life
[1:09:35] you say oh brother joe
[1:09:37] i gotta have a quote well i got one for
[1:09:40] you
[1:09:41] i'm glad you asked because some of y'all
[1:09:44] were scared you're like well i ain't
[1:09:45] done this i ain't done that ain't nobody
[1:09:47] getting healed in my meeting or in my
[1:09:49] home and this that and the other and i
[1:09:51] ain't never spoke in tongues and we all
[1:09:52] we go automatically we go to our doubts
[1:09:56] because we're human
[1:09:59] but he says now after all we'll get to
[1:10:01] this quote that i'm going to get to you
[1:10:02] so i can help establish you in the
[1:10:04] present truth
[1:10:06] he says after all passing tracks is not
[1:10:08] preaching the gospel the gospel came not
[1:10:10] in word only paul said but through power
[1:10:12] and demonstration of the holy spirit not
[1:10:14] just teach the word that's where we fail
[1:10:17] we just taught it
[1:10:19] there's been no reality to it we just
[1:10:20] taught it now our kids grow up with a
[1:10:22] message theology
[1:10:25] our kids can out debate baptist
[1:10:27] preachers
[1:10:28] because they know the reality of a
[1:10:30] godhead
[1:10:31] but they only know it most only know it
[1:10:33] to a certain age intellectually but when
[1:10:36] that god it becomes a reality and that
[1:10:38] god becomes a personal god and when they
[1:10:40] see jesus christ the same there ain't no
[1:10:43] demon in hell can shake them from the
[1:10:45] other the power of the gospel of who
[1:10:47] christ is
[1:10:50] see not just teach the word but preach
[1:10:52] it make the man he says make manifest
[1:10:55] the word the word has to be made alive
[1:10:58] it's a dead letter until it's made
[1:11:00] manifest and then it's quickened and
[1:11:02] it's brought to pass
[1:11:04] what god said it will do he says that's
[1:11:06] the gospel in action the new testament
[1:11:08] christianity
[1:11:10] see the word itself is dead
[1:11:12] until it becomes into action
[1:11:15] and produces life
[1:11:17] tucson tabernacle don't you settle for
[1:11:19] an intellectual gospel
[1:11:22] don't you settle for me and i can stand
[1:11:23] behind this pulpit and put it all
[1:11:25] together but there's no anointing
[1:11:26] following that ministry
[1:11:28] don't you settle for that don't you
[1:11:30] settle for just a man who can be able to
[1:11:32] teach a great big lecture and have you
[1:11:34] spellbound by how you can put all these
[1:11:36] great greek words together
[1:11:38] and yet it leaves you empty
[1:11:41] don't settle for that
[1:11:43] no
[1:11:44] you want somebody that can make the word
[1:11:46] live
[1:11:47] somebody that can preach you to a point
[1:11:50] that can bring the mysteries together to
[1:11:52] say it's not only for the prophets it's
[1:11:54] not only for the ministry but it's for
[1:11:56] me
[1:11:57] the mysteries are for me this is who god
[1:12:00] is and this is who i am i know who i am
[1:12:03] because i know whose i am i know that
[1:12:05] i've been called i know i've been
[1:12:06] anointed i know i've been elected there
[1:12:08] ain't no devil can keep me and shake me
[1:12:10] off my ground because why because god
[1:12:12] has become a living reality not an empty
[1:12:16] theology not an empty word but he's a
[1:12:19] living god and he's manifesting in my
[1:12:22] home in my body in my school on my job
[1:12:26] in my church he's a living god today and
[1:12:29] he's asking what are you gonna do how
[1:12:31] are you gonna present this guy to the
[1:12:33] world
[1:12:34] by allowing the same word to flow out
[1:12:37] from your life
[1:12:39] that's how we manifest christ it's a say
[1:12:42] just like mary said lord i don't
[1:12:44] understand it oh you said that i'm gonna
[1:12:47] have a son not knowing a man but no
[1:12:49] matter what father and be it unto me
[1:12:52] according to your word let my life bring
[1:12:55] forth the promised son
[1:12:57] that should be our desire lord let me
[1:12:59] bring forth this promised word for this
[1:13:01] hour
[1:13:06] he said what good
[1:13:08] is it going to do you to read about a
[1:13:10] historical god
[1:13:11] if he isn't the same god today
[1:13:15] faith in action
[1:13:17] 1955
[1:13:20] what good is it going to do you to read
[1:13:22] about a historical god
[1:13:25] if he's not the same god today what good
[1:13:28] is it going to do to read about old
[1:13:29] george washington if he's dead and gone
[1:13:33] see it's just a history fact but jesus
[1:13:36] raised from the dead
[1:13:37] and he's the same today
[1:13:41] what good is it to paint a fire to a
[1:13:44] freezing man
[1:13:46] oh come over here come by my beautiful
[1:13:48] portrait look at the flames they're so
[1:13:51] bright and yet you're still shivering
[1:13:53] you're still shaking but they want to
[1:13:55] present you oh this is what it used to
[1:13:58] be
[1:13:59] this is what the message used to be
[1:14:01] this is what the movement of the spirit
[1:14:02] used to be let me tell you church you
[1:14:04] can't get poor get get warmed by i used
[1:14:07] to be but i can here to tell you you can
[1:14:09] get excited by god today
[1:14:11] i tell the church don't you paint me a
[1:14:13] picture of no fire you start me at fire
[1:14:15] take that picture and put fire on it and
[1:14:18] let it begin to flare up that's what i
[1:14:20] want that's when it's going to warm the
[1:14:21] church that's what's going to excite the
[1:14:23] people is a living god a real fire the
[1:14:26] fire the holy ghost moving in the church
[1:14:28] moving in the people
[1:14:31] don't paint me a picture of what god did
[1:14:32] yesterday i want to see him today i want
[1:14:35] to see him manifest today i want to see
[1:14:37] when i lay hands upon the sea they shall
[1:14:39] be healed
[1:14:41] because it's not my word it's god's word
[1:14:43] and god is no better than his word
[1:14:52] try to get worn by pain and fire
[1:14:57] he says what we need today
[1:15:00] what we need is men and women who will
[1:15:02] stand up in the forefront and call the
[1:15:05] devil a liar
[1:15:09] oh mr devil
[1:15:11] that's how we act sometime
[1:15:13] we want to be so polite because we want
[1:15:14] to be christians right
[1:15:17] when the bible says the violent
[1:15:19] take it by force
[1:15:21] sometimes you just got to roll your
[1:15:23] sleeves up brother arnie
[1:15:25] take your jacket off
[1:15:27] cause you can't fight with a jacket on
[1:15:30] brother craig used to be a boxer
[1:15:32] i'd get him up here and display he'd
[1:15:34] float like a butterfly sting like a bee
[1:15:36] he only wishes he was muhammad ali
[1:15:42] but sometimes it's what it takes
[1:15:45] god your word is true
[1:15:47] and i see it in the reality by which you
[1:15:49] brought it
[1:15:50] and you got to stand there and you got
[1:15:51] to fight for every promise
[1:15:54] oh you going to get sucker punch
[1:15:56] because the prophet of god says satan's
[1:15:57] got a punch coming
[1:15:59] but i want you to know your god is
[1:16:00] bigger than your devil
[1:16:02] he's greater than your enemy
[1:16:05] says what good does it do to have a bird
[1:16:08] to have wings if he got him in a cage
[1:16:10] oh i got a beautiful parakeet he's
[1:16:12] beautiful and yet he can't fly nothing
[1:16:16] he's in a cage
[1:16:19] he says he can't fly he don't need no
[1:16:22] wings if you've got him in a cage he's
[1:16:23] he goes that's the way with a lot of
[1:16:25] these people
[1:16:27] i'm afraid that some of these churches
[1:16:28] has got our people in we're in cages
[1:16:32] they were destined
[1:16:34] brother branham would talk about that
[1:16:36] eagle he said
[1:16:37] it just gripped him he wanted to pay
[1:16:38] money to the zoo to let that bird out of
[1:16:40] that that cage he'd fly hit his head and
[1:16:43] fly and hit his head blood all down his
[1:16:44] head because he wasn't destined for the
[1:16:46] cage he was destined for the sky
[1:16:50] and let me tell you church you are too
[1:16:52] you're not bound by some man's idea has
[1:16:55] you caged up you can't go to this church
[1:16:57] you can't fellowship with this one and
[1:16:58] you got to believe this or you're not in
[1:17:00] the message that's hogwash
[1:17:03] that's a cage
[1:17:05] god's given us the skies to soar in this
[1:17:07] message is unlimited
[1:17:11] the greatest gift that god has done in
[1:17:13] this hour is to give us a vindicated
[1:17:16] message
[1:17:18] and this message has power
[1:17:20] this message has liberty
[1:17:23] it has healing it has deliverance it has
[1:17:25] everything that we have need of
[1:17:28] is in this message because this message
[1:17:31] is christ
[1:17:32] it's the anointing it's the word you
[1:17:35] take those men who used to preach this
[1:17:37] gospel
[1:17:38] and now they try to start their own
[1:17:40] little work outside of this as they left
[1:17:42] the message they don't have a ministry
[1:17:46] there's no anointing there they've tried
[1:17:49] because while the anointing rests in
[1:17:51] this word because this is not a
[1:17:53] prophet's word this is god's word to a
[1:17:55] generation this is god's word to a
[1:17:58] people this is god's word to an age it
[1:18:00] wasn't brother branham's word brother
[1:18:02] branham's ideas brother branham's
[1:18:04] doctrines this is christ's word christ
[1:18:06] ideas christ doctrine to christ's people
[1:18:09] to let you know that you're going to fly
[1:18:10] up into the heavenlies and can't no man
[1:18:12] hold you down because while he broke the
[1:18:15] prison bar when he said house of hell
[1:18:17] give way house of hell had to give way
[1:18:19] and it looks those that were captive
[1:18:22] they began shaking and popping and every
[1:18:24] one of them were set free i say oh
[1:18:26] tucson tabernacle let the winds of the
[1:18:28] spirit begin to flow through this place
[1:18:31] don't let some man crack you down and
[1:18:34] keep you crap down or crack down man i
[1:18:37] don't know the word i'm using here but
[1:18:38] keep you all beat down and keep you
[1:18:40] underneath your god-given privileges
[1:18:42] recognize who you are
[1:18:45] recognize that god has called you for
[1:18:47] liberation nothing can bind you nothing
[1:18:50] can hold you sickness can't hold you the
[1:18:52] oppression can't hold you anxiety can't
[1:18:55] hold you doubt can't hold you your past
[1:18:57] can't hold you god is here for you and
[1:18:59] he's setting you free
[1:19:05] yeah
[1:19:06] i love this word
[1:19:08] i know what it i know it works
[1:19:11] i know it works
[1:19:16] what good is your wings going to do you
[1:19:20] and what good is your faith going to do
[1:19:21] you if you can't turn it loose
[1:19:25] what good
[1:19:27] is your faith going to do you
[1:19:29] if you can't turn it loose
[1:19:31] when the spirit moves by your way
[1:19:33] and you feel like shouting
[1:19:37] and you don't
[1:19:41] what good
[1:19:42] is it gonna do you well i felt it
[1:19:45] but you didn't
[1:19:47] now i'm not trying to get all y'all to
[1:19:48] get emotional because i'm not trying to
[1:19:50] make you a bunch of little joe adams
[1:19:54] but i want you to know
[1:19:56] you're not in cages
[1:19:59] you're not in cages
[1:20:01] and the word is real
[1:20:03] and this holy ghost is real
[1:20:05] when they came out of that upper room
[1:20:07] they didn't come out of there with a dry
[1:20:08] confession they come staggering out like
[1:20:11] a bunch of drunks
[1:20:13] they knew they'd been in the presence of
[1:20:15] something greater than their humanity
[1:20:17] and i'm talking to you about a god
[1:20:18] that's greater than your humanity and
[1:20:20] when he comes by your way don't you be
[1:20:21] afraid to let go and give in to that
[1:20:24] anointing
[1:20:26] you know what we're worried that we're
[1:20:28] gonna be uh no church order out of order
[1:20:34] brother battle makes a statement he goes
[1:20:35] i'd rather have a little wildfire than
[1:20:37] no fire
[1:20:40] you know what happens with wildfire
[1:20:43] it may jump from here to over here
[1:20:45] from here to over here the least likely
[1:20:48] person while i would have never thought
[1:20:49] sister so-and-so would have done that
[1:20:51] because that's a little bit of wildfire
[1:20:53] jumping
[1:20:54] you know pentecostal jumping pews boom
[1:20:56] boom boom boom
[1:20:58] but he says never one time has i seen
[1:21:01] anybody get hurt
[1:21:03] never one time
[1:21:05] let me just say this if that was good
[1:21:07] enough for the prophet what about us
[1:21:10] what about us oh we're so afraid
[1:21:14] we don't want to be labeled pentecostal
[1:21:17] look i'd rather be called pentecostal
[1:21:19] than baptist
[1:21:22] and catholic
[1:21:24] you know sometimes even today
[1:21:26] you get the name message tacked on you
[1:21:28] and you got a bad name
[1:21:30] because the message can be
[1:21:32] only those that
[1:21:33] fellowship with jeff
[1:21:35] only those that fellowship over here
[1:21:39] are so many slanted ideas
[1:21:42] but we're eagles
[1:21:45] and what good is having these wings
[1:21:47] if we're not going to flex on the fly
[1:21:50] what good is believing in a living god
[1:21:53] if you're not if you're afraid to test
[1:21:55] his boundaries
[1:21:59] i ask god for big things
[1:22:03] i ask god for miracles
[1:22:06] i ask god to perform the supernatural
[1:22:10] you say bro joe you think you're a
[1:22:11] little bit bold to do that
[1:22:13] the prophet of god gave me a word he
[1:22:15] says look you asked for big things
[1:22:17] because big things is just as easy with
[1:22:19] god as little things
[1:22:22] big things you got a son you got a
[1:22:23] daughter out there in the world tattooed
[1:22:25] up drugs and whatever else and it looks
[1:22:27] like a big thing and you don't know how
[1:22:29] to pray ask god
[1:22:32] you ask god god won't disappoint you got
[1:22:34] to go after him
[1:22:36] we've seen god go get a hold of a little
[1:22:37] boy who was out in college and in drugs
[1:22:40] and different things like that because a
[1:22:41] little young sister came up for prayer
[1:22:43] and within 15 20 minutes comes
[1:22:44] staggering in that's asking god for big
[1:22:46] things
[1:22:49] i believe god blew her mind that night a
[1:22:52] matter of fact god blew all of our minds
[1:22:54] at night
[1:22:55] because we said yeah hey that's good
[1:22:57] prayer let's believe we're going to
[1:22:58] believe for it we had no expectation
[1:23:00] that god was going to do it right then
[1:23:02] but you know that reminds me it was in
[1:23:03] the bible
[1:23:06] peter was in the bible peter was bound
[1:23:09] peter was bound he was in prison he was
[1:23:11] going to be crucified the next day he
[1:23:13] was going to be executed but they begin
[1:23:15] to pray
[1:23:16] oh and here comes the angel of the lord
[1:23:19] come strolling by peter's sale hey peter
[1:23:21] oh boy how about we get up and leave
[1:23:23] this place because i'm the same today as
[1:23:26] i was yesterday
[1:23:28] oh and peter said whoa whoa whoa he
[1:23:30] began to walk past that one then he
[1:23:32] began to walk past that one then begin
[1:23:34] to walk past and then all of a sudden
[1:23:35] peter's on the street
[1:23:36] oh peter's mind was blown sometimes our
[1:23:39] minds are blown when we see god move
[1:23:41] when we see god do this and we see god
[1:23:43] do that and peter all of a sudden he's
[1:23:45] at the door knocking
[1:23:49] i think i can preach right now
[1:23:52] they were praying and they wasn't
[1:23:54] believing
[1:23:56] and sometimes that's what's wrong with
[1:23:58] us we pray this prayer because we really
[1:24:01] want it to come to pass but read down
[1:24:02] the heart we don't really believe but
[1:24:04] little damsel comes to the door who is
[1:24:07] it
[1:24:09] well it's peter
[1:24:11] it can't be peter peter you're in jail
[1:24:13] peter you're in bondage peter they got
[1:24:15] you they're gonna crucify you tomorrow
[1:24:17] she said he said it's peter i'm here
[1:24:20] she run back
[1:24:22] oh peter's at the door oh that's so
[1:24:24] foolish you young little girl how stupid
[1:24:27] of you to think that don't you know the
[1:24:28] days of miracles in this past don't you
[1:24:30] know god don't move like that don't you
[1:24:31] know god don't heal like that don't you
[1:24:33] know god don't speak in tongues anymore
[1:24:34] don't you know god don't do those things
[1:24:35] anymore she said yes he is he's at the
[1:24:38] front door peter came knocking on the
[1:24:40] front door
[1:24:42] and there came a one
[1:24:44] open the door
[1:24:48] well hey peter
[1:24:51] we just been praying for you
[1:24:56] sometimes that's how we are
[1:24:59] well hey god
[1:25:01] we really wanted this
[1:25:03] i really didn't believe it
[1:25:05] but you know what god does he does it
[1:25:08] he does it despite your unbelief
[1:25:11] because he's trying
[1:25:12] to anchor your faith that you can
[1:25:14] believe god in your lowest times
[1:25:17] when the devil has put out an all-out
[1:25:20] assault on your life and your family you
[1:25:23] can trust god
[1:25:24] you can believe god
[1:25:26] god has given you faith wings and levi's
[1:25:28] two son tabernacle i'd begin to flex
[1:25:31] those faith wings tonight and wednesday
[1:25:33] and sunday and every day that ends in y
[1:25:36] that happens to be every day just for
[1:25:37] y'all that didn't know that
[1:25:40] i'd begin to pray i began to believe god
[1:25:42] if you can do that for peter you can do
[1:25:44] that for me if you can do that for peter
[1:25:46] you can do that for his believers god
[1:25:48] send us a pastor god move upon the heart
[1:25:51] god move in this church let this place
[1:25:53] be turned upside down with the power of
[1:25:55] a living god
[1:25:56] we don't want just an intellectual
[1:25:58] understanding i don't want just a
[1:26:00] prophet hanging on the wall i want a
[1:26:02] prophet's message in my heart
[1:26:04] manifesting in my life i want the
[1:26:06] display of the signs and wonders i want
[1:26:08] a living god manifested in my life
[1:26:18] i got 35 minutes can i
[1:26:20] go he says that's the way it is today
[1:26:24] you might send your boys to seminary
[1:26:26] school
[1:26:27] teach them all kind of theology all
[1:26:28] about this and that and the other but if
[1:26:30] you're afraid to turn your faith loose
[1:26:33] to trust god
[1:26:34] what good does it do you to teach them
[1:26:38] what good church
[1:26:43] if shakespeare lived in me
[1:26:46] you would expect me to write some of the
[1:26:49] most beautiful poetry
[1:26:51] thankfully shakespeare don't live in me
[1:26:54] and i don't write poetry
[1:26:56] but if beethoven
[1:26:58] lived in you
[1:27:00] you would just expect you sit down with
[1:27:01] this beautiful grand piano
[1:27:04] never had touched it before
[1:27:06] just begin to softly play
[1:27:08] and all of a sudden the most beautiful
[1:27:10] melody flows out
[1:27:13] because beethoven
[1:27:15] is in your family
[1:27:17] maybe great-grandparents
[1:27:19] great-grandpa bay
[1:27:24] or papa beethoven
[1:27:27] you would expect these things
[1:27:30] because why
[1:27:31] because you know it's part of your
[1:27:32] family
[1:27:35] and if jesus christ
[1:27:37] is living in us
[1:27:40] shouldn't we expect
[1:27:42] to do the same thing
[1:27:44] shouldn't we oh my
[1:27:46] shouldn't we expect to see the
[1:27:48] supernatural
[1:27:50] because why because he's the same
[1:27:52] and it doesn't go back to your dna
[1:27:54] naturally
[1:27:56] but it's your dna supernatural
[1:27:58] the same anointing the same god the same
[1:28:02] spirit that was in him manifesting then
[1:28:05] is the same one that's here tonight
[1:28:07] manifesting in the hearts and lives of
[1:28:09] believers
[1:28:12] so if he's a living god
[1:28:15] then he's got to be a living god in you
[1:28:17] tonight
[1:28:19] he's got to be manifested somewhere now
[1:28:22] notice the word word is logos
[1:28:26] that's the word that was spoken by god
[1:28:29] but the word gospel is taking that same
[1:28:32] logos
[1:28:33] and putting it in action
[1:28:36] it's one thing for the logos to be the
[1:28:38] logos and never move from that anointing
[1:28:40] and always be the logos because it is
[1:28:43] but there's another thing when you take
[1:28:45] the logos this word and begin to put it
[1:28:47] in action
[1:28:48] it becomes the gospel
[1:28:51] it becomes that word that reality that
[1:28:55] truth begin to manifest in lives of
[1:28:58] frail humanity those that you discounted
[1:29:01] god says don't you discount them
[1:29:05] you looked at me 25 years ago you never
[1:29:07] gave me
[1:29:08] hope but thankfully
[1:29:11] my life didn't depend on what you
[1:29:12] thought about me or what others thought
[1:29:14] about you
[1:29:16] no because god had me and his thoughts
[1:29:19] see i was a thought a word
[1:29:22] and then he put that word into action
[1:29:24] and now you see signs and wonders
[1:29:27] following the ministry signs and wonders
[1:29:30] following the life let me just bring
[1:29:31] this to you
[1:29:33] he says what we need to do is turn our
[1:29:36] faith loose now i'm not asking you to
[1:29:38] act like a bunch of nuts
[1:29:41] sometimes i'm afraid that's what we we
[1:29:43] think about we're going to just be all
[1:29:45] crazy everybody's going to be jumping
[1:29:46] and shouting y'all seen the video on
[1:29:48] youtube where they got that man in that
[1:29:50] pentecostal church he's running around
[1:29:51] swinging his jacket he runs and jumps
[1:29:53] into the baptism nope that's not us
[1:29:56] i'm not asking to do that
[1:29:59] oh please heaven forbid us do that
[1:30:02] we would get a bad name
[1:30:04] but we want the gospel we want the word
[1:30:07] in
[1:30:07] action
[1:30:09] we want to see what good is your wings
[1:30:12] going to do you if you don't have faith
[1:30:14] or if you what good is your faith going
[1:30:16] to do you if you can't turn it loose
[1:30:18] see what good is your faith
[1:30:20] certainly if i believe jesus lives today
[1:30:22] that i'll put it in action
[1:30:26] if i believe jesus is alive today then
[1:30:28] i'll put it into action and that is
[1:30:30] faith in action
[1:30:32] 1955. so we want the gospel preached to
[1:30:35] us and the gospel the prophet of god
[1:30:37] says is the good news the good news is
[1:30:39] the bible but the bible is the letter
[1:30:40] and the letter kills but the spirit
[1:30:42] gives life so paul will say the gospel
[1:30:44] came not through word only but through
[1:30:46] power and manifestation of the spirit
[1:30:48] the only way that the gospel could be
[1:30:50] preached then will be to manifest the
[1:30:52] power of the holy spirit when he says
[1:30:55] now watch the next quotation when these
[1:30:57] signs shall follow them that believe not
[1:31:00] signs shall may or may follow them or
[1:31:02] ought to follow them but these signs
[1:31:04] shall follow them that believe
[1:31:08] and there's men today
[1:31:11] who are under the auspice of this
[1:31:13] message don't believe in altar calls
[1:31:15] they don't believe in prayer lines they
[1:31:18] don't believe in emotion they don't
[1:31:19] believe in speaking in tongues they
[1:31:21] don't believe in the movement of the
[1:31:23] holy spirit
[1:31:24] let me just say this how can you sell a
[1:31:27] product if you don't believe in it
[1:31:30] how can you sell the holy ghost how can
[1:31:33] you sell this message to your kids if
[1:31:35] you don't believe in it
[1:31:38] why does my kids serve the lord because
[1:31:41] they see it i believe in it
[1:31:45] brother craig's family serve the lord
[1:31:47] because why because he believes in it he
[1:31:49] knows what god's done in his life
[1:31:52] he's he recognizes that only god can
[1:31:55] take a man from where he was and to
[1:31:57] where he is today
[1:32:00] only god and so we preach it because we
[1:32:02] believe it doesn't mean that we're
[1:32:04] perfect absolutely not we're not perfect
[1:32:07] we make mistakes yeah we have to go and
[1:32:08] we have to go before our family we have
[1:32:10] to apologize i'm sorry i did this and
[1:32:12] i'm sorry i did that but yet we witness
[1:32:14] a living god
[1:32:16] we don't let down on the bars just
[1:32:18] because they're our kids
[1:32:20] we hold the banner high
[1:32:22] christ is risen
[1:32:24] this message works if it saved me and i
[1:32:27] saved my son if it saved me to save my
[1:32:29] daughters if it saved me to get me
[1:32:30] through the hard times it'll be with my
[1:32:32] family and let me tell you if he did it
[1:32:33] for me he can do it for you
[1:32:36] if he did it for me he can do it for you
[1:32:38] i know that
[1:32:41] so we find here
[1:32:44] that the signs will follow the believer
[1:32:46] but if you don't believe
[1:32:48] the prophet of god says you have
[1:32:49] spiritual amnesia
[1:32:53] he says now you are identified with that
[1:32:56] or you have got some spiritual amnesia
[1:32:58] he goes
[1:33:00] that you find out you don't believe
[1:33:01] those signs follow believers if you
[1:33:03] don't believe it then you have spiritual
[1:33:05] amnesia you've forgotten that god
[1:33:07] promised it
[1:33:10] how can they not believe in prayer lines
[1:33:12] because they've forgotten
[1:33:14] that god has promised it
[1:33:15] god has promised to heal the sick
[1:33:19] they've forgotten that god comes at an
[1:33:21] altar
[1:33:22] that god still moves at an altar
[1:33:26] god still answers prayer at an altar i
[1:33:28] was at a youth meeting several years ago
[1:33:31] at a church i wasn't preaching but i was
[1:33:33] there and i was operating and working
[1:33:35] and praying for some of the young people
[1:33:36] that was at the altar and the pastor of
[1:33:38] the church
[1:33:39] just began to stop it
[1:33:42] young girl over here about this point
[1:33:44] over here began to shout and scream she
[1:33:46] was beginning to break free and he'd
[1:33:47] come over there and stopped it
[1:33:50] and began to talk you don't have to act
[1:33:52] like that you don't have to get
[1:33:53] emotional all you got to do is accept it
[1:33:57] what good
[1:33:58] was those wings
[1:33:59] if he clipped him and wouldn't let her
[1:34:01] fly
[1:34:05] it's okay to have altar calls
[1:34:08] it's okay to have a stirring of the
[1:34:10] spirit
[1:34:12] let me just say it's okay to have a
[1:34:13] living god in our midst
[1:34:15] he may not come the way you're used to
[1:34:19] but maybe because you're not used to
[1:34:20] seeing god move
[1:34:22] but god's going to move anyway
[1:34:26] god's going to move despite
[1:34:28] you despite your unbelief
[1:34:31] despite anything of our fair humanity
[1:34:34] god's going to move because god's
[1:34:35] promise if there's one person here
[1:34:38] tonight that wants to see god move you
[1:34:40] will guess what god will move
[1:34:43] you may not see it you may not witness
[1:34:45] it but that heart will testify that god
[1:34:47] moved
[1:34:49] and god moved
[1:34:50] and god moved on me
[1:34:52] this service may not be for one person
[1:34:55] but i can tell you it'll be
[1:34:56] life-changing
[1:34:59] jesus christ is the same today
[1:35:03] what
[1:35:04] are you
[1:35:06] going to do
[1:35:08] spiritual amnesia he said this very
[1:35:10] message of the gospel itself is to prove
[1:35:12] to the people that he has risen
[1:35:15] and how can we prove that he has risen
[1:35:17] if there's no signs
[1:35:19] if there's no wonders
[1:35:21] if there's no tongues if there's no
[1:35:23] supernatural display of his presence of
[1:35:26] his being how are we going to tell this
[1:35:28] dying generation that he's alive if
[1:35:31] there's nothing to show them
[1:35:34] i'm not trying to make a spectacle out
[1:35:35] of god but i believe god displays
[1:35:38] himself in our frail humanity to show to
[1:35:40] this dying generation that he is in fact
[1:35:42] alive
[1:35:45] we've seen god at our church
[1:35:47] one miracle after another after another
[1:35:50] after another after another
[1:35:53] we've seen god
[1:35:55] i can preach to you because the reality
[1:35:58] that i've seen god move i've seen god
[1:36:00] cast out devils
[1:36:03] i've seen him not only at my hands but
[1:36:05] at brother craig's hands other ministers
[1:36:07] in our church we've seen it we've gone
[1:36:08] to battle
[1:36:11] and you know what the first time can i
[1:36:13] just be human for a minute
[1:36:14] i got a few more minutes don't i i got
[1:36:17] 25 minutes so i'm going to take my time
[1:36:22] how many of you are human tonight
[1:36:24] okay some of y'all back here you're not
[1:36:25] you ain't figured it out you're aliens
[1:36:29] but many times when we never experienced
[1:36:31] a supernatural
[1:36:33] our first
[1:36:35] first thing that we do is we go to our
[1:36:38] humanity right
[1:36:39] i remember the first time in a prayer
[1:36:41] line
[1:36:42] we had this sister come up and then we
[1:36:44] had we faced seven demonic spirits at
[1:36:46] night at a youth camp
[1:36:48] and not only that i mean
[1:36:50] if you never dealt with that brother
[1:36:51] aaron
[1:36:52] i mean first thing you're checking up
[1:36:54] man make sure your life is clean
[1:36:56] i mean you're doing a quick thorough
[1:36:58] inventory real quick
[1:37:00] because your first thought is
[1:37:03] am i ready for this can i do this is
[1:37:05] this dependent upon me but it's not
[1:37:08] but your life has to be clean you have
[1:37:11] to know that god has called you for that
[1:37:13] purpose
[1:37:15] but it wasn't until afterwards that we
[1:37:17] face
[1:37:18] one of the probably the most serious
[1:37:20] case was a young girl at our church when
[1:37:22] i spoke about this morning that had
[1:37:23] epilepsy but she not only had epilepsy
[1:37:25] she had a suicidal spirit and she had a
[1:37:27] couple other spirits and we began to
[1:37:29] pray and we went on for 45 minutes to an
[1:37:31] hour
[1:37:32] and we'd prayed and would speak to it
[1:37:35] we'd bind the serpent she tried to hit
[1:37:37] she couldn't hit us
[1:37:39] we tell it to stop speaking it would
[1:37:40] stop speaking
[1:37:42] but you have to recognize in your mind
[1:37:44] that your humanity is called into
[1:37:46] question but more so your spirituality
[1:37:49] you got to know that god has called you
[1:37:51] for that and i just remember the first
[1:37:53] time we faced that or first time that i
[1:37:56] faced that
[1:37:57] i couldn't help but think man
[1:37:59] what's going to happen here
[1:38:01] because i never seen it happen before
[1:38:04] but we learned a lot in that weekend
[1:38:07] we learned that god never fails
[1:38:10] i learned that he's the same truly the
[1:38:12] same yesterday today and forever but
[1:38:16] there and i've seen god heal
[1:38:18] i've laid my hands on people and i've
[1:38:19] seen them healed but i never once until
[1:38:22] that that weekend laid my hands on
[1:38:24] somebody and seen the devil leave
[1:38:26] but i can tell you today
[1:38:29] i'm not afraid to face one devil
[1:38:33] i faced him
[1:38:34] just here we had our easter meetings and
[1:38:36] brother danny steven and i were praying
[1:38:37] with this young girl
[1:38:39] and she came up she had a lustful spirit
[1:38:41] owner a pornography spirit of
[1:38:43] pornography and suicidal and we i began
[1:38:45] to pray me and brother dana begin to
[1:38:47] pray and she begins to fall back and the
[1:38:49] first thing that a spirit does will
[1:38:50] begin to fall
[1:38:52] and getting the scream out thinking that
[1:38:54] it's done okay i bluffed him i got him
[1:38:57] i said i've seen this happen too many
[1:38:59] times
[1:39:00] so i was like a bulldog i jumped on i
[1:39:02] didn't jump on her but i just went down
[1:39:05] and i began to pray
[1:39:07] and i began to rebuke that spirit
[1:39:08] because she made known what it was that
[1:39:11] had her bound and when she made it known
[1:39:13] it had to leave
[1:39:15] and i began to go down and begin to pray
[1:39:17] with her and when she come up she was a
[1:39:19] different person and she was just at our
[1:39:21] annual meetings and she was a different
[1:39:22] person
[1:39:24] you know once maybe a couple years ago i
[1:39:25] would have been timid because my
[1:39:27] humanity because i hadn't seen god move
[1:39:29] like that
[1:39:30] but i drew courage believing and seeing
[1:39:32] god manifest himself
[1:39:35] so you ask me what will you do brother
[1:39:37] joe i'm gonna display christ
[1:39:40] i'm going to do what the word says
[1:39:42] i'm going to lay hands on the sick and
[1:39:44] i'm going to expect god to heal him i'm
[1:39:46] going to lay hands on i'm going to
[1:39:47] expect the devil to leave
[1:39:49] because he can't hold you because god's
[1:39:51] promise is greater than any unbelief
[1:39:54] so that's just a little testimony that
[1:39:57] i've faced in my humanity and i
[1:39:58] understand we all face those moments
[1:40:02] but god is still god
[1:40:05] god is still
[1:40:06] god god is still god
[1:40:10] and we are to preach the gospel manifest
[1:40:13] a word and the gospel is the power of
[1:40:15] god to make the word act what it says
[1:40:18] it'll do
[1:40:21] brother branham was going to india and
[1:40:23] he landed in the indian as i started
[1:40:24] bringing this down
[1:40:26] he said there was a mess a methodist
[1:40:28] bishop and many of them came out to meet
[1:40:30] him and they said brother branham we've
[1:40:32] heard of these things we preached the
[1:40:34] word and we know
[1:40:35] more about theology perhaps than all you
[1:40:38] americans put together because the
[1:40:39] bible's an eastern book
[1:40:42] and he said that's right he says but we
[1:40:44] want to see someone anointed with the
[1:40:46] holy ghost that can make it live
[1:40:48] again and i believe that's what we want
[1:40:51] as believers tonight we want somebody
[1:40:54] that can make this world live again
[1:40:57] somebody that is not afraid to go
[1:40:59] toe-to-toe with the devil and proclaim
[1:41:02] that jesus christ is alive today
[1:41:06] see we want somebody that can produce
[1:41:08] what the bible says it will do otherwise
[1:41:10] we want to see the faith that was once
[1:41:13] delivered to the saints
[1:41:15] we want a young person that can believe
[1:41:17] this message in the same god that save
[1:41:20] mama and save daddy and fill them with
[1:41:22] the holy ghost is
[1:41:24] excuse me the same god that gets a hold
[1:41:25] of their life and rises them up above
[1:41:28] their humanity
[1:41:29] above the enticements of this world
[1:41:32] we want to see that we want to see god
[1:41:34] manifested in sons and daughters we want
[1:41:37] to see harmony in the church
[1:41:41] we want to see dissension left
[1:41:44] dissipated we want to see a people come
[1:41:46] together understanding that we are
[1:41:49] serving a living god
[1:41:51] so let's work in harmony one with
[1:41:53] another let's proclaim the glory of god
[1:41:57] oh we're going to have our differences
[1:41:59] as humans
[1:42:00] but let's put our differences aside
[1:42:03] let's put our bitterness aside let's put
[1:42:05] our unforgiveness aside we're too close
[1:42:07] to the coming of the lord to allow those
[1:42:10] things to hang us up
[1:42:17] they said in the message jehovah java
[1:42:20] bible says did the church members
[1:42:22] actually see him in that day he said no
[1:42:24] sir
[1:42:26] they never seen him in the light of who
[1:42:28] he was
[1:42:29] they seen him in his corporal body
[1:42:31] because they had a sense of sight those
[1:42:32] who could see
[1:42:34] they saw him in the light
[1:42:35] that he was a human being but they
[1:42:37] didn't see him in the light as a son of
[1:42:39] god
[1:42:41] and i'm afraid church sometimes we don't
[1:42:43] see each other in the light
[1:42:45] of what we really are
[1:42:48] we see each other in our humanity
[1:42:51] and you may not like my preaching
[1:42:54] you may think i'm too loud
[1:42:57] or i don't stay behind the pulpit long
[1:42:58] enough because other people come and
[1:43:00] they stand by i don't really care
[1:43:06] because see in our humanity there's
[1:43:08] gonna be things about me that let me
[1:43:10] just be honest i don't like
[1:43:13] and there may be things about you that i
[1:43:15] don't like
[1:43:18] but when it comes to us being sons and
[1:43:21] daughters of god
[1:43:23] we've got to look beyond the veil of
[1:43:25] humanity
[1:43:27] and look to the anointing
[1:43:29] god saw something in that sister
[1:43:33] to call her to this glorious message and
[1:43:36] if god can look past her failures or his
[1:43:40] failures and their mistakes why can't we
[1:43:45] why can't we
[1:43:47] if he's the same today then i ask
[1:43:50] you what are you going to do
[1:43:53] how are you going to bind together as a
[1:43:55] church who's in need of a pastor
[1:43:58] you can't do it bickering and fussing
[1:44:01] you got to do it by coming together
[1:44:04] looking beyond our frail humanity and
[1:44:08] looking to see what god has
[1:44:10] deposited on the inside of each of us
[1:44:13] inside of each and every one of you
[1:44:15] that's been born again of the holy
[1:44:17] spirit is eternal life god took a part
[1:44:20] of his own self and he placed it right
[1:44:23] there
[1:44:26] then he put a sign that says ah devil
[1:44:28] take your hands off
[1:44:30] you can't have them you can't hold them
[1:44:33] because why i've claimed them
[1:44:35] and if god can claim us
[1:44:37] then why shouldn't we claim ourselves
[1:44:42] you know i can't preach like brother
[1:44:43] craig
[1:44:45] man you want to talk about a theologian
[1:44:47] in the message
[1:44:48] but he's anointed theologian
[1:44:52] y'all need to get this man here to
[1:44:53] preach
[1:44:54] he should have just preached tonight
[1:44:56] made me up here working i'm so tired
[1:45:00] brother aaron was telling us at lunch
[1:45:02] you know how he preaches we're all
[1:45:04] different
[1:45:05] but we're all needful
[1:45:07] to the perfecting of the body not
[1:45:10] everybody can be a teacher i tried to
[1:45:12] teach
[1:45:14] i remember i was going to do a youth
[1:45:15] meeting and i started a youth meeting on
[1:45:17] the holy ghost i did seven parts on the
[1:45:18] holy ghost i only taught one and
[1:45:20] realized that ain't my calling
[1:45:23] them poor kids got a dose of the holy
[1:45:25] ghost in a way they never had it before
[1:45:28] i preached a holy ghost high
[1:45:30] and hell hot
[1:45:33] i remember one time before brother craig
[1:45:35] took his church up there i was doing
[1:45:36] church order
[1:45:37] they only had me do it one time
[1:45:40] i ain't never been back since
[1:45:42] i preached the brother told me says bro
[1:45:44] joe i never heard church order preach
[1:45:45] quite like that
[1:45:47] boy it had so much fire in the church
[1:45:49] i put the church in order
[1:45:53] because we're all different
[1:45:56] you're different get used to different
[1:46:00] accept your differences
[1:46:02] become a body
[1:46:04] a body of believers
[1:46:06] who are wanting to make a rapture
[1:46:08] who are going to make a rapture who are
[1:46:12] going to make a rapture and i'm in them
[1:46:14] with this musicians you can come
[1:46:17] brother brown was in i believe it was
[1:46:19] mexico and he was down there preaching
[1:46:21] there was a pastor down there and he had
[1:46:23] a little four-month-old little baby and
[1:46:26] the baby had cancer in its mouth you may
[1:46:28] have heard the story and i'm just i'm
[1:46:30] i'm going off to tuc it's in my notes
[1:46:32] but i'm just going to preach just for a
[1:46:33] few minutes here
[1:46:35] this baby's mouth was swollen up he had
[1:46:37] been cut he's four months old
[1:46:40] and the pastor found out that brother
[1:46:42] branham was in the air i think it was la
[1:46:43] concente or something of that nature it
[1:46:45] was mexico or somewhere in arizona it's
[1:46:47] some spanish name excuse me i don't know
[1:46:49] it
[1:46:50] i don't speak spanish
[1:46:53] you're okay with that right
[1:46:55] good
[1:46:56] uh
[1:46:57] and so he invited brother branham he
[1:46:59] asked brother brad if he would come and
[1:47:00] pray for his baby he says you know me
[1:47:02] being a pastor but yet this being my son
[1:47:04] maybe i'm weak in faith
[1:47:06] because we all at some points
[1:47:09] we get to those points when it's your
[1:47:11] family maybe your faith quite can't rise
[1:47:14] up to the challenge
[1:47:16] but you can have faith to believe for
[1:47:17] somebody else
[1:47:19] that's why we're a family
[1:47:21] that's why we have to come together
[1:47:22] that's why we come on a sunday night
[1:47:25] so we can draw strength as a family
[1:47:27] because you know what somebody else may
[1:47:29] be able to step in
[1:47:31] and use their faith and the message is
[1:47:33] perfect faith the prophet of god will
[1:47:34] say possibly maybe god can use my faith
[1:47:38] the faith that i have in his word to
[1:47:41] heal you
[1:47:43] is that right sister rachel
[1:47:45] that's testimony right back there
[1:47:48] because that's the very words i spoke to
[1:47:50] i said god can use my faith
[1:47:52] at the end of a service
[1:47:54] because i know his power
[1:47:56] i know his might i know his ability i
[1:47:59] know his word is true
[1:48:01] and she accepted god upon my faith
[1:48:05] and god did not disappoint have you had
[1:48:06] another issue
[1:48:08] completely healed
[1:48:09] this is some year later god's a healer
[1:48:12] church
[1:48:13] so we find this little baby
[1:48:16] jaws all cut up cancer in the jaws
[1:48:18] tongue swollen out they had to put a
[1:48:20] tracheotomy in the throat brother man
[1:48:22] would call it a whistle
[1:48:24] and drain the cancer out
[1:48:27] and the father came in and he said
[1:48:30] oh little ricky daddy's little ricky
[1:48:32] brother i'm saying when he said that
[1:48:34] he just had to grab the side of his bed
[1:48:37] just imagine if this was your little boy
[1:48:41] satan's trying to take his life at four
[1:48:43] months
[1:48:44] cancer just ravished his entire face
[1:48:48] he's got cut surgeries where they tried
[1:48:50] to remove the cancer to no avail his
[1:48:52] tongue swollen up to the top he can't
[1:48:54] breathe so they had to put a tracheotomy
[1:48:56] in his throat
[1:48:58] they put splints on his hand so he
[1:48:59] wouldn't pull the tubes out
[1:49:01] see
[1:49:03] if you could just enter into that
[1:49:04] hospital room with me right now
[1:49:06] and see this case
[1:49:09] and yet a prophet of god was standing
[1:49:11] there knowing his position
[1:49:14] and he would question god
[1:49:17] god
[1:49:18] how can you allow this
[1:49:21] surely this breaks your heart
[1:49:25] god of all mercy and compassion
[1:49:29] how can you let this little baby suffer
[1:49:33] because even brother branham
[1:49:35] had humanity that he had to deal with
[1:49:40] he said in a moment's time
[1:49:43] he goes now i know i'm standing behind
[1:49:44] the pulpit
[1:49:46] because if you've got to take me at my
[1:49:47] word he said there was a voice
[1:49:49] that spoke down to me and says
[1:49:52] you're waiting on me to do something
[1:49:55] but i'm waiting on you
[1:50:00] you've been waiting on me to do
[1:50:02] something
[1:50:03] and the prophet of god said could it be
[1:50:05] that this whole time
[1:50:08] that god is waiting on you to do
[1:50:10] something
[1:50:13] god is waiting on you to move
[1:50:16] god is waiting on you to call out
[1:50:19] god is waiting on you to ask
[1:50:22] ask for big things
[1:50:26] ask for big things
[1:50:28] he's a big god
[1:50:32] he's a big god
[1:50:35] brother bam said he began to pray for
[1:50:36] that little boy he said lord i put
[1:50:39] between this demon of cancer
[1:50:42] and this little child the holy spirit
[1:50:46] and he said he got up
[1:50:48] he didn't have anything left to say he
[1:50:49] was emotionally drained
[1:50:52] because he recognized
[1:50:55] his humanity
[1:50:58] he said but he left that room
[1:51:01] and just a few hours later
[1:51:03] he got a call brother
[1:51:05] the jaws came back normal
[1:51:08] the tongue
[1:51:10] came back normal and they was
[1:51:12] discharging the boy the very next day
[1:51:18] i'm here to tell you about a god we
[1:51:20] serve
[1:51:22] and some of you come this evening you
[1:51:24] got anxiety
[1:51:26] you got fears
[1:51:27] you're dealing with depression you're
[1:51:29] dealing with disappointments
[1:51:31] you're dealing with failures and you're
[1:51:33] waiting on god to do something
[1:51:36] but could it be that god is waiting on
[1:51:38] you tonight
[1:51:40] could it be that he's waiting on you to
[1:51:42] respond
[1:51:44] could it be that he's waiting on you to
[1:51:46] take him at his word tonight
[1:51:48] some of you here are maybe dealing with
[1:51:50] sickness
[1:51:51] in the body
[1:51:54] you know every day that i get up in the
[1:51:55] morning i recognize i'm not as young as
[1:51:57] i was the day before
[1:51:59] i asked my wife she got up and she's
[1:52:01] been talking about a back problem all
[1:52:03] morning
[1:52:04] she's all that bad
[1:52:09] oh that bed
[1:52:14] but god is waiting god is waiting on us
[1:52:17] church
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:19] he gave us a word that says ask anything
[1:52:21] in my name and i'll grant it
[1:52:24] what's everything you desire when you
[1:52:26] pray if you can believe
[1:52:28] you can have whatsoever you ask
[1:52:30] ye can have
[1:52:32] whatsoever ye ask
[1:52:35] ask that your joy may be full
[1:52:39] ask over
[1:52:41] and over and over and over
[1:52:44] he's commissioned us to take that word

[1:54:58] father we just bow before you right now
[1:55:02] lord not sure how to close this meeting
[1:55:04] this evening but i feel that this is the

[1:55:10] your neighbor

[1:55:13] yourself but pray for your neighbor this
[1:55:15] evening
[1:55:16] we're a church family we're a bride
[1:55:18] we're a body we're believers
[1:55:21] maybe your need is
[1:55:23] bigger than you and maybe your faith is
[1:55:25] not strong enough
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:27] but maybe that person has got his hands
[1:55:29] laid on you right now
[1:55:31] gotta use their faith
[1:55:34] to give you the desire of your heart
[1:55:37] god i pray this evening

[1:55:47] i thank you lord that this message
[1:55:50] is not just something that was preached
[1:55:52] in the 40s 50s and 60s

[1:56:08] tonight father

[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:14] perhaps the situation is greater than
[1:56:16] they can even humanly comprehend
[1:56:19] for god we're not going to look at human
[1:56:21] comprehension
[1:56:23] or human ability

[1:56:27] promise tonight lord

[1:56:39] believing
[1:56:41] that the gospel

[1:56:47] jesus is being manifested
[1:56:50] the people
[1:56:51] are becoming the word made flesh

[2:08:29] the word of god tells us he was tempted
[2:08:31] and tried in every manner
[2:08:33] that is common to man hard to understand
[2:08:36] hard to believe that but he took on a
[2:08:38] body of flesh
[2:08:40] to be able to be touched by the feeling
[2:08:42] of your infirmities
[2:08:44] by the struggles
[2:08:45] by the battles by the fights that go on
[2:08:47] with within

[2:13:27] you know brother brown talks about a
[2:13:28] rain pelting experience and it began to
[2:13:30] pelt my body and i got afraid i said not
[2:13:32] now lord wait till tonight
[2:13:35] brother green just told me why don't you
[2:13:36] have it then and tonight
[2:13:39] you learn your lessons he's the same
[2:13:40] yesterday today forever he'll do those
[2:13:43] things
[2:13:44] i've shared that testimony many times
[2:13:46] when my wife was going through and i'd
[2:13:48] hold her in my arms trembling from that
[2:13:50] nervousness and fear and i'd say lord
[2:13:52] put her to sleep and she'd literally
[2:13:54] fall asleep in my arms
[2:13:56] and one day she said it's just this
[2:13:57] roaring that's in my head that never
[2:13:59] stops
[2:14:00] and i reached over and i prayed for her
[2:14:01] and i said lord put a song in her heart
[2:14:04] she woke up that morning she says i
[2:14:05] don't know what it is but there's
[2:14:07] something in my heart a song coming out

[2:14:13] but he's the same yesterday

[2:14:24] that centurion
[2:14:27] he stopped god by his faith but he says
[2:14:30] he says you don't have to come here and
