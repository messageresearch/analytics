[44:52] as you're turning appreciate the songs
[44:54] from Sister Cheryl
[44:57] sister Jessica
[45:01] they were definitely In The Same Spirit
[45:05] about speaking the name of Jesus it's
[45:08] still Small Voice and sister Jessica was
[45:10] singing that song in Jesus name I was
[45:12] listening to the words and did you
[45:15] notice that those words weren't
[45:18] Lord bless me Lord help me Lord give me
[45:21] strength those words from that song were
[45:24] prayers over other people
[45:26] it was praying for somebody else
[45:31] blessed me it says I pray that I pray a
[45:33] breakthrough would happen today
[45:36] I pray that mirror I pray Miracles over
[45:38] your life in Jesus name

[45:43] what a beautiful spirit
[45:45] I don't know who wrote that song but God
[45:46] blessed them may the blessings of God
[45:48] rest upon the writer of that song
[45:52] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 14
[45:54] says this
[45:57] For the Love of Christ
[45:59] constrainteth us
[46:01] because we thus judge that if one died
[46:04] for all then we're all dead
[46:09] and he and that he died for all
[46:12] that they which live should not
[46:15] henceforth live unto themselves
[46:20] but unto him which died for them and
[46:23] rose again
[46:26] wherefore henceforth
[46:28] no we
[46:30] no man after the flesh
[46:33] yea though we have known Christ after
[46:35] the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
[46:38] no more therefore If any man be in
[46:41] Christ
[46:42] he is a new creature
[46:45] old things are passed away
[46:48] behold all things are become new

[48:53] had some on my heart this week
[48:55] to uh well it's over the past couple
[48:57] weeks to minister on
[49:01] and it comes from
[49:03] and uh
[49:05] I'll tell them about it maybe at the end
[49:07] of service
[49:09] it's about a dream I had about 30 years
[49:11] ago
[49:12] more than 30 years ago and
[49:15] and
[49:16] um
[49:17] it uh it really became real to me a
[49:20] couple years ago
[49:22] and it has to do with something that
[49:25] Daniel and I had the honor of doing
[49:28] um you know most of you know Brother
[49:30] David fontener he's a tremendous brother
[49:32] he and sister Sharon they do so much for
[49:35] the Lord they do so much for the young
[49:37] people what Brother David knows he knows
[49:39] I like airplanes
[49:41] and Brother David is an F-16 fighter
[49:44] pilot he's uh he's in the Air Force and
[49:48] he's an instructor and and he he texts
[49:51] me and he says hey he says I've got some
[49:52] time
[49:53] in this F-16 simulator
[49:56] he said would you and Daniel want to
[49:58] come
[49:59] and I was like yeah that's like a dream
[50:03] so as I said I've always loved airplanes
[50:05] and jets and stuff so Daniel and I
[50:10] went out to the base
[50:13] and brother Davis sat us in his
[50:15] simulators and the simulator it's it's
[50:17] an actual it's an exact replica of a
[50:21] cockpit of an ex F-16 fighter jet and so
[50:25] it's got all the controls it's got all
[50:27] all of the displays up there and then
[50:29] around you is a is a screen that that
[50:33] you can see and it looks like it looks
[50:35] like the sky it looks like the ground
[50:37] it's just an exact simulation of when
[50:40] you're flying in this fighter jet
[50:42] So Daniel and I of course we get in
[50:45] there and and Brother David he teaches
[50:47] us the the different controls and stuff
[50:49] and you know I think I can do this okay
[50:51] so so he says okay take off and he tells
[50:54] me how to take off and then he goes over
[50:56] to Daniel and tells him to how to take
[50:58] off and so I I followed your directions
[51:01] I immediately crashed into the into the
[51:03] end of the runway because I couldn't get
[51:05] the flaps down and and the nose up and
[51:08] all that so the the uh the simulator had
[51:11] Grace on me so it eventually got me up
[51:13] in the air
[51:14] and I'm flying around then Brother David
[51:16] goes from Daniel's simulator and he
[51:18] comes over into mine
[51:20] and he says okay do this and and do that
[51:24] and have this control and here's the
[51:26] afterburner and here's here's the
[51:28] propulsion and here's the here here's
[51:30] the the he's using these different
[51:32] technical terms on how you fly the jet
[51:34] and and I'm flying and I'm feeling
[51:36] pretty good about myself and he says
[51:38] okay now go down into the mountains
[51:40] around Tucson and we're flying over
[51:42] Tucson and I mean you could see our
[51:45] houses
[51:46] over over in the on the simulator and
[51:48] you know I'm looking around and and I'm
[51:50] flying I'm putting my nose down and I
[51:52] can see the ground and and up and I'm
[51:54] flying so I go down into the mountains
[51:55] over in the Tucson mountains and I'm
[51:57] flying around
[51:58] the the the the valleys and and stuff
[52:01] and and I was just trying not to crash
[52:04] and uh and I got what I thought was
[52:07] pretty good I I didn't Daniel's over
[52:08] there doing the same thing
[52:11] and uh then Brother David he he puts us
[52:14] into a combat scenario and here come
[52:16] these these hostile airplanes and
[52:19] they're these big giant jumbo jets
[52:21] flying really slow you know and and and
[52:25] we're flying around we're trying to get
[52:27] in behind them and shoot them with the
[52:28] guns and and uh and it's just a great
[52:32] time
[52:33] and
[52:35] as I was flying as I was in that cockpit
[52:38] Brother David would come over and he'd
[52:41] put his hand over mine and he'd say okay
[52:43] do this and do that and and pull up and
[52:47] and down and then he then we were able
[52:50] to uh it was a couple hours running
[52:52] buddy and then we were able to finally
[52:55] land the jet and um he told us how to
[52:59] approach the runway in that
[53:01] and it made me think of this experience
[53:05] I had when I was a young man
[53:07] this dream that I had
[53:09] and uh I was thinking
[53:12] that this simulator it's not real
[53:15] it's a video game
[53:17] it's it's probably cost Millions upon
[53:20] millions of dollars but you're not
[53:22] actually in a jet you're just you're
[53:24] just flying around
[53:26] on on this simulation and they make it
[53:28] as real as they can but it's still not
[53:30] real
[53:33] and my thought as always goes to the
[53:37] Lord
[53:38] and I
[53:40] and I'm thinking about Lord how many
[53:43] men and women
[53:45] that call themselves Christians today
[53:48] brother Glenn sister did not didn't see
[53:51] you back there God bless you it's good
[53:52] it's good to see you how many
[53:56] Christian men and women today that claim
[53:59] to be Christian are just flying around
[54:01] in a simulation
[54:04] that they think is Christianity
[54:07] but it's not
[54:10] they're they're in a they're in
[54:12] something faster in just a big video
[54:14] game
[54:16] and I was
[54:17] this past week we've a lot of things
[54:20] have happened with with the people in
[54:21] the past week and and
[54:25] still some people have been on my heart
[54:27] that I would like to pull and and come
[54:30] to church and try to try to get them to
[54:33] enjoy the spirit around around church
[54:37] and and I've been just reaching out to
[54:39] different people and there's there's
[54:42] many times that I'm I'm getting a a love
[54:45] you
[54:46] Dan
[54:48] or or brother Daniel or however my
[54:50] relationship with with them is I love
[54:53] you
[54:53] but
[54:55] I don't want that
[54:58] and they don't have to have this church
[55:00] it's not this church
[55:03] that that matters
[55:05] but it's that that they have that
[55:07] relationship with the Lord that matters
[55:10] they don't have to come they don't have
[55:12] to come here but they have to find
[55:13] Christ that's the only way that you can
[55:15] come
[55:16] is that if you find Christ otherwise
[55:19] it's just a similar it's a simulation of
[55:21] Christianity
[55:23] and that's the title of my sermon today
[55:25] is the simulation of Christianity
[55:28] and so often I think it's it's actually
[55:31] not most
[55:34] but it seems like today it's almost
[55:36] every person
[55:39] that claims Christianity are they really
[55:43] finding Christ are they really a
[55:47] Christian or is it just flying around in
[55:50] a simulator
[55:53] and it's it's
[55:55] been on my heart and talking with
[55:57] certain people and it's it's like well
[56:00] I don't want to if I go to that church
[56:03] and they're thinking in their mind if I
[56:04] go to that church then I'm going to have
[56:06] to give up certain parts of my life
[56:11] and they say
[56:12] not directly
[56:15] but they say they know that if they
[56:17] start going to a certain church then
[56:21] they will have to give up certain things
[56:23] that are in their life
[56:25] those things are more important
[56:30] than Christ
[56:33] and they would never say that
[56:36] so often we want to say the Lord is my
[56:39] savior and he is and how much I love
[56:41] Jesus and oh I'm all about Jesus and
[56:44] Jesus he saved me from my sins and I
[56:47] know that if I sin he's going to save me
[56:49] and he is but that will make him their
[56:51] savior but they will not make him their
[56:54] lord
[56:56] he is Lord and savior
[56:59] Lord is ruler
[57:02] every part of our lives
[57:06] should be ruled by Jesus Christ not
[57:09] ruled by the church not ruled by church
[57:11] doctrine heaven forbid not not that but
[57:15] ruled by the holy spirit of God which is
[57:19] Jesus Christ in spirit form dwelling in
[57:22] the human being
[57:25] yet
[57:27] they'll claim as a him as Savior
[57:30] but not as Lord
[57:32] because I'd have to give up too much
[57:37] and if they really had him as Lord
[57:40] if this was really important to them
[57:44] it wouldn't be I have to give up
[57:45] anything
[57:47] you would just start loving the Lord and
[57:50] those things they just fall off
[57:54] let's read a scripture first John
[57:56] chapter 2.
[57:59] it's a scripture that's common to us but
[58:01] we need to it needs to come to our mind
[58:03] all the time
[58:05] first John 2
[58:08] verse 15.
[58:10] first John
[58:12] says this
[58:14] love not the world
[58:17] neither the things that are in the world
[58:19] if any man loved the world the love of
[58:22] the father is not in him what does that
[58:24] mean
[58:27] does it mean that we love our lives
[58:31] more than we love God
[58:36] for all that is in the world
[58:39] the lust of the flesh
[58:41] the lust of the eyes
[58:43] the pride of life
[58:47] is not of the father
[58:49] The Pride
[58:50] of life
[58:52] is not of the father
[58:54] but is of the world
[58:57] and the world passeth away and the lust
[59:00] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[59:03] God abideth forever
[59:07] he that does the will of God is with God
[59:11] forever
[59:13] as I said they're fine with calling
[59:15] Jesus their Savior and giving glory to
[59:18] God for bringing them out of some sort
[59:20] of sin or some sort of problem or losing
[59:23] a job and getting a new job or or
[59:26] falling into into sin and being
[59:29] delivered they're fine with giving Jesus
[59:31] the credit for that but they don't want
[59:34] to make him their ruler every day
[59:38] it's just too much
[59:40] and I say to those people
[59:43] and to myself
[59:45] are you just flying around in a
[59:46] simulator
[59:48] are you just playing a video game
[59:50] or is this real to you
[59:53] are you willing to do anything
[59:57] for the Lord Jesus Christ not because
[59:59] you have to
[1:00:01] but because you love him because you
[1:00:04] love him more than you love your life
[1:00:09] you love him more than you love your
[1:00:13] wealth you love him more than you love
[1:00:16] your job you love him more than you love
[1:00:19] your Styles and your fashion you love
[1:00:20] him more than you love your vacations
[1:00:22] you love him more than you love
[1:00:24] everything you love Jesus more than
[1:00:27] anything
[1:00:30] will you put him first
[1:00:33] I
[1:00:36] it's with with these some of these
[1:00:38] people though they'll
[1:00:40] raise up in the faith
[1:00:43] that that many of us or most of us have
[1:00:46] been raised in
[1:00:48] and for some of the visitors I'm going
[1:00:50] to quote
[1:00:51] a man named named William Branham who
[1:00:54] was a he was a a prophet of God a great
[1:00:56] man that revolutionized
[1:00:59] the Christian Church way back in the
[1:01:01] 1950s and and showed people that Jesus
[1:01:06] Christ is alive and he's he's done he's
[1:01:09] powerful and he's not a God that's dead
[1:01:13] and he's a God that does Miracles and he
[1:01:16] is a God that stays with his word
[1:01:22] and many times you'll see people they'll
[1:01:26] they'll leave a church or they'll leave
[1:01:29] their their way of thinking
[1:01:33] and the reason is because it wasn't real
[1:01:36] in the first place
[1:01:38] it was a simulator
[1:01:41] as I say many times it was simply a book
[1:01:43] of rules and it didn't hold fast it
[1:01:46] didn't it didn't take they didn't see
[1:01:48] that Christ is in his word
[1:01:52] and I
[1:01:53] I was a
[1:01:55] we talk about modesty in church and we
[1:01:57] talk about how important it is for us
[1:01:59] men and women to look like Christians in
[1:02:03] every aspect of of Our Lives
[1:02:06] I was with um
[1:02:08] you all saw many of you saw my nephews
[1:02:10] that came out Joel and Benjamin my
[1:02:13] brother Adam's Sons
[1:02:15] um Daniel and Joel and Benjamin and
[1:02:18] another young brother we met for lunch
[1:02:20] in my office
[1:02:23] and uh we went out to lunch we just
[1:02:25] walked from my office my office is over
[1:02:28] on campus at the University and we we
[1:02:31] went out
[1:02:33] and I said well you guys just park in
[1:02:35] the lot here come up to my office and
[1:02:37] and then we'll go and uh we'll go eat on
[1:02:39] campus and I thought it'd be good you
[1:02:41] know these these these kids are young
[1:02:43] they'll enjoy going on the University of
[1:02:45] Arizona campus and it'll be a good
[1:02:47] experience for them
[1:02:49] so we get out there
[1:02:51] and we walk from my office and we walk
[1:02:54] down campus and I was so embarrassed
[1:02:59] by the way
[1:03:02] that
[1:03:04] almost all nine out of ten of these
[1:03:07] young women were dressed
[1:03:11] I was like
[1:03:12] feeling so bad and we're walking down
[1:03:15] and and these girls are walking along
[1:03:17] and the boys are behind me and and I was
[1:03:21] like oh man I
[1:03:23] I feel bad they're wearing clothes that
[1:03:25] they shouldn't wear in front of their
[1:03:26] mama
[1:03:29] so we're going along and
[1:03:32] and we go to eat and we come back
[1:03:36] and I I pray and it's like Lord
[1:03:40] wow I didn't I didn't know it was that
[1:03:43] bad
[1:03:45] and we talk so much about
[1:03:48] in our circles we talk so much about a a
[1:03:50] woman's dress and let me tell you
[1:03:53] something
[1:03:55] with the woman's dress the thing that
[1:03:57] bothers me so much
[1:03:59] is that you see the people leave and
[1:04:01] some of these people that I'm I'm
[1:04:03] witnessing to you see the people leave
[1:04:06] and they and the first thing they say is
[1:04:08] oh you left the message she put on a
[1:04:11] pair of pants
[1:04:13] what a shame what an absolute shame that
[1:04:17] our message the thing that we believe
[1:04:19] has been lowered and degraded to a dress
[1:04:22] code
[1:04:24] what a shame
[1:04:26] let me tell you God sent
[1:04:30] a messenger to preach the gospel and
[1:04:33] that gospel was Jesus Christ is alive
[1:04:36] today
[1:04:41] and he is and we have ruined it by
[1:04:44] making it a little thing like a dress
[1:04:47] code shame
[1:04:49] shame on the ministers over all these
[1:04:51] years for doing that
[1:04:54] but I want to approach things of course
[1:04:57] with a balance and my point to these
[1:05:00] other
[1:05:01] these people that have left wait a
[1:05:03] minute
[1:05:04] the Bible still says
[1:05:08] First Timothy 2 9 a woman shall Adorn
[1:05:12] herself in modest apparel
[1:05:15] the word still says that
[1:05:19] you can't change it
[1:05:21] well I don't really I don't really want
[1:05:23] to uh I don't want to do that so and and
[1:05:27] well if you don't want to follow that
[1:05:29] part of of the word then do you want to
[1:05:32] follow the part about baptism do you
[1:05:34] want to put follow the part about
[1:05:36] salvation do you want to follow the part
[1:05:39] about giving your heart still to the
[1:05:40] Lord what part do you want to follow and
[1:05:42] what part do you not want to follow
[1:05:44] you're playing a video game
[1:05:48] so these these women walking around
[1:05:51] the thought came to me
[1:05:53] take one of these women that we saw on
[1:05:56] campus at the University take one of
[1:05:58] them pull them out
[1:06:01] stick them over here on Oracle Road say
[1:06:03] walk down the road
[1:06:06] and see how many men stop to pick him up
[1:06:08] as a prostitute
[1:06:11] that's how we should be thinking
[1:06:14] how am I presenting myself
[1:06:18] to the public how am I presenting myself
[1:06:21] to a man is it that if you picked me up
[1:06:24] and set me out there on Orca road that
[1:06:26] the men would be stopping to pick me up
[1:06:28] as a prostitute
[1:06:29] there's something wrong
[1:06:32] that's never been the case I don't
[1:06:34] believe until today
[1:06:36] that we have gotten so low
[1:06:41] that we look it's just normal
[1:06:44] the vast majority
[1:06:47] look like that and you know me I am not
[1:06:49] someone
[1:06:51] that preaches a book of rules in a
[1:06:53] legalistic Doctrine but the facts are
[1:06:55] the facts take one and put them on the
[1:06:57] road see what happens
[1:07:00] 9 out of ten of them
[1:07:06] but it is it's
[1:07:09] it's
[1:07:10] sad to me
[1:07:13] that
[1:07:14] that our message
[1:07:17] has just become a dress code
[1:07:21] no no if you want to please the Lord
[1:07:24] Jesus
[1:07:26] then you are going to please him you are
[1:07:28] going to do whatever it takes not
[1:07:31] because I set a rule how long your skirt
[1:07:33] should be ridiculous
[1:07:37] but because the holy spirit is guiding
[1:07:40] you brother is guiding you sister in
[1:07:43] everything that you do I get criticized
[1:07:46] on one end I get criticized you need to
[1:07:49] preach you need to preach about these
[1:07:51] girls wearing those clothes you need to
[1:07:53] get them how dare you
[1:07:56] I preached Jesus Christ let them come to
[1:07:59] him and then there's the other side
[1:08:02] that says you need to preach that it's
[1:08:04] okay to do whatever you want and just
[1:08:05] accept Jesus how dare you
[1:08:08] the word is the word
[1:08:10] but if you have that relationship with
[1:08:13] Christ
[1:08:15] then then you're not in a simulator
[1:08:18] anymore you're not in a fake religion
[1:08:23] you're following Christ
[1:08:27] so I was
[1:08:31] a little bit
[1:08:33] um
[1:08:34] sometimes you know you get ticked off
[1:08:36] and you shouldn't we shouldn't so so I
[1:08:40] get on I get on the table and I start
[1:08:42] searching brother Brown's message like
[1:08:44] okay
[1:08:46] how many times did he really say pants
[1:08:49] so I started I've read every single
[1:08:52] quote
[1:08:53] my brother Brown talked about pants
[1:08:56] 1200 sermons 1206 1207 whatever it is
[1:09:01] three
[1:09:02] he talked about a woman wearing pants
[1:09:04] now there's there's other ones that he
[1:09:06] used other words
[1:09:08] but I was taken back by the quote that
[1:09:11] kept coming up
[1:09:13] this should be the message
[1:09:16] this should should be what we are
[1:09:18] preaching in message churches let me
[1:09:19] read you read to you this quote from
[1:09:22] God's provided way
[1:09:24] this quote kept coming up over and over
[1:09:28] and let me tell you what the message is
[1:09:32] you don't judge a man
[1:09:37] you don't judge a man by the callous in
[1:09:39] his hand
[1:09:40] but by the bags in the knees of his
[1:09:43] pants
[1:09:44] where he's been praying
[1:09:46] Hallelujah that's what we need today
[1:09:49] some more men like that got real Godly
[1:09:52] old-fashioned Holy Ghost conviction
[1:09:55] I'd rather have a man like that with my
[1:09:57] boy if he didn't know even his ABCs to
[1:09:59] stand out there by a stump somewhere in
[1:10:01] a broom sage and pray for him till he
[1:10:04] come through with the Holy Ghost than to
[1:10:07] have all the teachers there is in the
[1:10:08] world trying to poke theology in him
[1:10:11] amen
[1:10:13] brother that's the truth
[1:10:15] what we need today is to get back to
[1:10:18] God's provided way for Sinners friends
[1:10:22] that provided way for Sinners is to meet
[1:10:26] Jesus Christ to understand him to to
[1:10:30] have a relationship with Christ and then
[1:10:33] he will correct
[1:10:35] our heirs not to have a weak pulpit
[1:10:39] not to have a jellyfish up here
[1:10:40] preaching to you that won't stand up for
[1:10:43] anything no not to have that
[1:10:45] to have someone that preaches this word
[1:10:47] but will also stand up against the the
[1:10:51] dogmas that we have created over the
[1:10:53] years
[1:10:55] that's right also
[1:10:59] we
[1:11:01] when it
[1:11:02] the more that we get closer
[1:11:07] to Christ the more that we give our
[1:11:10] hearts over to him the more that we see
[1:11:15] that
[1:11:17] many of these doctrines that we've had
[1:11:20] over the years that we've accepted over
[1:11:22] the years you know what they're not
[1:11:23] they're not right
[1:11:26] we've taken a quote here and a quote
[1:11:28] there and a quote over here
[1:11:30] and put them all together and now
[1:11:33] it's
[1:11:35] message
[1:11:37] theology
[1:11:40] and instead we ignore
[1:11:43] what every sermon whatever
[1:11:47] thing that was preached was about which
[1:11:49] is about Christ
[1:11:51] which is about that relationship with
[1:11:53] Christ which is about receiving the Holy
[1:11:55] Spirit
[1:11:57] then once you receive that Spirit now
[1:12:00] you have something
[1:12:02] I've heard
[1:12:05] people saying oh well if you get them to
[1:12:09] Christ then they will come to the
[1:12:12] message of brother Branham no no no no
[1:12:14] no no no that is you got it backwards
[1:12:18] everything is to get to Christ
[1:12:21] brother branham's message I'll tell you
[1:12:23] will help you get there
[1:12:25] I promise
[1:12:27] it was the truth it is the truth it's
[1:12:29] beautiful but it will help you get to
[1:12:32] Christ not the other way around you
[1:12:34] don't put somebody's message over the
[1:12:36] Lord Jesus
[1:12:37] every prophet in this Bible was pointing
[1:12:40] us to Christ
[1:12:42] that is where we need to go is the Lord
[1:12:45] Jesus
[1:12:46] and it will bring Holiness it will it
[1:12:50] will bring pureness
[1:12:53] and uh
[1:12:55] then
[1:12:56] I was reading
[1:12:58] I was thinking about this sermon in
[1:13:00] Isaiah 64.
[1:13:03] it says this
[1:13:06] Isaiah 64. 6 many of us have probably
[1:13:09] quoted this it says but we are all as an
[1:13:12] unclean thing
[1:13:14] and all our righteousness are as filthy
[1:13:17] rags
[1:13:19] and we all do and we all do Fade as a
[1:13:23] leaf
[1:13:24] and our iniquities like the wind have
[1:13:26] taken us away
[1:13:27] and there is none that called upon the
[1:13:29] name that stirth up himself
[1:13:32] to take hold of thee for thou has hid
[1:13:34] thy face from us
[1:13:36] and has consumed us because of our
[1:13:38] iniquities
[1:13:39] but now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father
[1:13:43] we are the clay
[1:13:45] Thou Art our Potter
[1:13:46] and we are the work of thy hand
[1:13:49] and I see that
[1:13:51] the Pharisees and Sadducees I talk about
[1:13:53] them a lot I see that they're righteous
[1:13:56] deeds and how they preached a legalistic
[1:13:58] Doctrine and they live this legalistic
[1:14:00] way and God looks down at him says it's
[1:14:02] a stink in my nose
[1:14:05] it's filthy rags before me but then I
[1:14:09] see someone else come in
[1:14:12] and bow down and wash his feet
[1:14:15] he looks over here he sees the Pharisees
[1:14:17] it says Your Righteous Deeds are filthy
[1:14:20] rags to me but this little lady over
[1:14:23] here this righteous deed that she did
[1:14:26] it's a blessing it comes up before me as
[1:14:29] a sweet smelling savor
[1:14:32] why
[1:14:34] because we think that maybe our way of
[1:14:39] living our righteous Deeds make us
[1:14:41] righteous they don't
[1:14:43] Christ
[1:14:44] makes us righteous
[1:14:46] Jesus is the one he is he is the one
[1:14:50] that makes us to serve him
[1:14:54] doesn't make us serve him
[1:14:56] but He blesses us by serving him
[1:15:01] I am
[1:15:05] with
[1:15:07] Christ and and and with
[1:15:12] the these these people and I looked and
[1:15:14] and as I said I was looking at these
[1:15:17] these girls out on campus at the U of A
[1:15:21] I was like man this is this is rough
[1:15:24] this world and I go outside and and I
[1:15:27] see that all of the drug addicts and and
[1:15:30] all that are out there and I see the
[1:15:33] thing that troubles me the most
[1:15:37] is really the church goer
[1:15:41] is really the one that says well I'll
[1:15:43] take the Lord's word as long as it fits
[1:15:48] my lifestyle
[1:15:51] and if it doesn't fit my lifestyle
[1:15:53] whatever that lifestyle is friends
[1:15:55] if it doesn't fit my lifestyle then I
[1:15:58] think I'll go to another church
[1:16:01] that teaches more along my way of
[1:16:04] thinking
[1:16:06] it should not be your way of thinking
[1:16:09] it shouldn't be my way of thinking
[1:16:13] it should be Christ's way of thinking
[1:16:15] and we should get into his program
[1:16:17] whatever that program is
[1:16:20] and we should be able to surrender
[1:16:22] ourselves to the Lord and give our
[1:16:25] hearts to him give our lives to him and
[1:16:28] then he would lead us and he would put
[1:16:29] that Holiness in there
[1:16:33] and and as these some of these people
[1:16:35] have been on my heart and I and I've
[1:16:37] said that they've left because they
[1:16:39] didn't want to maybe look this way
[1:16:43] or dress that way
[1:16:47] and it's because it was taught wrong
[1:16:49] it's not that
[1:16:52] it's Christ in you as that that's for
[1:16:54] scripture that I read
[1:16:57] but there's still you don't throw out
[1:16:58] the word
[1:17:00] the word is still there
[1:17:02] and everything that Holy Spirit when you
[1:17:05] receive that Holy Spirit it will align
[1:17:08] with his word
[1:17:11] but the first thing the first thing is
[1:17:14] we need to make a commitment we need to
[1:17:16] make our lives do our best to match up
[1:17:20] to what Christ teaches
[1:17:23] Matthew chapter 15 said that Jesus says
[1:17:27] they honor me with their lips
[1:17:29] but their hearts are far from me
[1:17:33] how many
[1:17:34] how many in this room now
[1:17:37] is that true for
[1:17:40] talk about the Lord and how good the
[1:17:41] Lord is and how much I love the Lord and
[1:17:43] and
[1:17:44] and how I and how I do this for him and
[1:17:47] and how I come to church and I and but
[1:17:50] inside
[1:17:53] I want something else
[1:17:56] and if the preacher says something that
[1:17:58] disagrees with my theology I'll just go
[1:18:00] to another church
[1:18:03] and I was thinking about some of these I
[1:18:05] was praying for him last night
[1:18:10] and I was thinking
[1:18:12] that's Lord
[1:18:15] they don't have to come to our church
[1:18:16] they don't have to come to our way of
[1:18:18] thinking but will they find Christ if
[1:18:20] they find Christ somewhere else God
[1:18:22] bless them
[1:18:23] they found Christ
[1:18:27] we talk about
[1:18:28] there's different ages and
[1:18:31] and
[1:18:34] ages change times change God doesn't
[1:18:37] change he's he's God and he changes not
[1:18:40] but but people change
[1:18:42] and God loves the people so much
[1:18:47] that he will make ways in different ages
[1:18:51] to help us
[1:18:53] and we see that
[1:18:55] I was talking with somebody yesterday
[1:18:58] that from a pre from a from an earlier
[1:19:02] generation than mine
[1:19:04] and saying that that the lord gave you
[1:19:06] away in your generation and it wasn't
[1:19:09] like the previous generation before you
[1:19:11] when I when I was growing up I have a
[1:19:14] different desire on my heart and and I
[1:19:17] like different things it's it's my
[1:19:20] generation and God provides for me and
[1:19:22] we look now and we Face a generation of
[1:19:27] of people that have come up differently
[1:19:29] they've been raised differently
[1:19:31] some of the kids we would consider maybe
[1:19:34] brats
[1:19:36] it's like man a kid would never act like
[1:19:38] that when I was a kid
[1:19:39] I remember in school
[1:19:42] that the principal or the teacher
[1:19:45] would spank the tar out of you
[1:19:48] in school
[1:19:52] you remember that I remember I remember
[1:19:55] sitting in class and this kid uh Brian
[1:19:57] petticord he he's this little kid and he
[1:20:02] came he came back to class he was out of
[1:20:04] class for a little bit he came to class
[1:20:05] and his eyes were red and he was still
[1:20:07] crying
[1:20:08] I was like what happened man
[1:20:10] well I got principal spanked me
[1:20:15] what'd you do I don't even remember what
[1:20:17] he did but he got spanked
[1:20:20] that was my generation
[1:20:23] but this new generation you can't do
[1:20:25] that
[1:20:26] I'm not saying that that was right I'm
[1:20:29] saying it was a different generation so
[1:20:31] God now provides for this new generation
[1:20:34] he provides he provides for them
[1:20:38] and you see the the direction I'm trying
[1:20:40] to go they need time the kids need they
[1:20:45] need to be together that's why I'm
[1:20:46] building these rooms out there they have
[1:20:49] to have that
[1:20:51] and you might say well they just need
[1:20:54] the word and they just need services and
[1:20:55] they just need somebody preaching them
[1:20:57] it's not going to work
[1:20:59] that may have worked for the generation
[1:21:01] before me
[1:21:04] but it doesn't work for this generation
[1:21:07] yet God is still God
[1:21:10] and he still meets he still meets our
[1:21:13] needs he still takes care of us he still
[1:21:15] provides for us
[1:21:17] I was
[1:21:19] and
[1:21:21] if we truly are not in that simulator
[1:21:25] it should draw people to us
[1:21:29] not say I don't want to be like them
[1:21:34] and that's how it is so often
[1:21:36] well that church I don't want to be like
[1:21:38] them they're rude to me and they're this
[1:21:40] way and that way
[1:21:42] Christ says draw if I would be lifted up
[1:21:45] I would draw all men to me and we have
[1:21:48] that Spirit we draw those people in not
[1:21:50] being weak you don't draw somebody in by
[1:21:52] being weak
[1:21:54] you draw someone in by having love
[1:21:59] and I was a few years I don't know five
[1:22:03] years ago or so I got a call
[1:22:06] when I was in the ministry in
[1:22:07] Jeffersonville I got a call from a lady
[1:22:09] in Georgia
[1:22:11] and we were talking about dress and we
[1:22:14] um just now I was talking about how
[1:22:16] important it is that we represent
[1:22:18] ourselves as a Christian and not
[1:22:20] somebody that would be picked up on
[1:22:21] Oracle Road well this lady calls
[1:22:25] and she says
[1:22:27] I don't know who they were
[1:22:31] she says but I walked into McDonald's
[1:22:34] and there were three women in there
[1:22:37] and she said they were dressed so nice
[1:22:40] they look so pretty
[1:22:42] and she said they just had such a spirit
[1:22:46] about them
[1:22:50] and she said
[1:22:52] I just want to be able to get in touch
[1:22:53] with them they gave me this track and
[1:22:56] has your phone number on the back
[1:22:59] and I said well sister I could uh let me
[1:23:02] let me see where are you at and she's
[1:23:05] told me what town she was in Georgia she
[1:23:07] says I was in McDonald's and she said
[1:23:09] there was something about these three
[1:23:12] women
[1:23:13] she was that I wanted to be like
[1:23:17] she said sir she said I could tell that
[1:23:20] they knew God that they knew Jesus and I
[1:23:23] wanted to have what they had
[1:23:27] and I said I said well that's that's
[1:23:30] quite a testimony
[1:23:32] that lady and her husband and her family
[1:23:36] she gave her heart to the Lord not
[1:23:40] because of church not because of a
[1:23:44] Doctrine but because of the spirit that
[1:23:47] those women had and the love that they
[1:23:50] presented to this lady
[1:23:52] they weren't flying in a video game
[1:23:56] those sisters were flying a jet fighter
[1:23:59] they were doing it right
[1:24:02] when I was when I was young
[1:24:05] I was 19 years old
[1:24:08] I had a dream
[1:24:11] and I won't go through the whole dream
[1:24:13] I'm just going to give you just the very
[1:24:15] first part of it
[1:24:18] and it shook me up so bad
[1:24:21] that
[1:24:23] it was it was coming to the close I was
[1:24:25] I was up in Phoenix and I was playing
[1:24:26] ball up there I was going to college it
[1:24:28] shook me up so bad that I ended my
[1:24:31] baseball career I wanted to just come
[1:24:34] home I wanted to change my life
[1:24:37] because of this dream
[1:24:39] it shook me up that bad
[1:24:42] what it was
[1:24:44] I dreamed that I was with a friend of
[1:24:46] mine who was a a good he was a good
[1:24:50] person
[1:24:51] love the Lord
[1:24:54] and we were we had gone on to another
[1:25:00] place
[1:25:01] that was not this world
[1:25:04] and it was a beautiful place
[1:25:08] and we were walking along these wooden
[1:25:11] sidewalks and the place was just
[1:25:13] gorgeous and I was I and I was looking
[1:25:16] around and and
[1:25:18] my I asked my friend I said are we in
[1:25:21] heaven and my friend said yeah he says
[1:25:23] we're in heaven
[1:25:27] ah it's beautiful this is one
[1:25:30] and I was just I was so happy and as we
[1:25:32] were walking along out comes this this
[1:25:35] young lady and she's in this long skirt
[1:25:38] long hair she she walks she walks by us
[1:25:42] in front of us and we're walking along
[1:25:44] the sidewalk and she stumbles a little
[1:25:46] bit
[1:25:49] and she said oh and then she said a
[1:25:52] four-letter word not a bad four-letter
[1:25:54] word
[1:25:54] a four-letter word that probably many
[1:25:57] people you shouldn't be but many people
[1:25:59] in this congregation might say not
[1:26:02] something that is cussing
[1:26:04] but not appropriate for me to say at the
[1:26:07] pulpit I'll tell you out there if you
[1:26:08] want to know
[1:26:10] but she said a word
[1:26:13] that was not necessarily acceptable
[1:26:17] and I looked
[1:26:20] and I said oh no
[1:26:23] and my friend immediately didn't notice
[1:26:27] and he said yep we're in heaven I said
[1:26:30] no we are not
[1:26:33] so the dream goes on
[1:26:36] law very
[1:26:40] symbolic very spiritual dream that I
[1:26:43] know came from God and I will say this
[1:26:45] for 30 years
[1:26:49] I didn't think about that dream often
[1:26:52] I thought about that dream every day of
[1:26:54] my life
[1:26:56] for 30 years
[1:26:59] and what it was is I was in a place that
[1:27:02] I thought I was right but I was right on
[1:27:05] the gates of hell
[1:27:08] living a good life
[1:27:10] I was right there ready to go
[1:27:14] and I didn't know it
[1:27:16] it was a simulation
[1:27:18] of Christianity I was going along and it
[1:27:21] was something that wasn't real
[1:27:24] and I thought about that my whole life
[1:27:28] until the Lord finally revealed to me
[1:27:30] what it was
[1:27:34] and it's been
[1:27:36] since that time
[1:27:37] I was a couple years ago
[1:27:40] that the Lord showed me what it was
[1:27:42] and since that time it's been one of the
[1:27:45] greatest blessings
[1:27:46] that I've ever had in knowing what it
[1:27:49] meant and knowing that God had my life
[1:27:52] in his hand this whole time but he
[1:27:54] showed me that you are not going down
[1:27:58] the right Road even with all of your
[1:28:00] religion with all of your church with
[1:28:02] all of your legalism with all of that it
[1:28:04] doesn't matter unless you know the true
[1:28:07] Jesus Christ
[1:28:09] it's a simulation of Christianity
[1:28:13] if you don't know him
[1:28:16] personally I just preached on you have
[1:28:19] to have a testimony
[1:28:21] if you don't know Christ and you are not
[1:28:24] sure
[1:28:27] then you could be walking on the same
[1:28:29] road that I was walking on
[1:28:32] same age as many of you young people
[1:28:36] but thank God he gave me that and I
[1:28:38] always thought Lord why did you
[1:28:40] why did you give me this dream if my my
[1:28:43] destination was just going to be hell
[1:28:47] but my destination wasn't hell
[1:28:49] he was warning me
[1:28:52] be careful
[1:28:54] no Christ
[1:28:57] it's not about
[1:28:59] a church
[1:29:01] it's not about what your pastor thinks
[1:29:04] it's not about what the priest says
[1:29:08] it's about do you know the Lord Jesus
[1:29:13] I was in that simulator me and Daniel
[1:29:15] are going
[1:29:16] having so much fun you know crashed a
[1:29:19] couple times
[1:29:20] what if
[1:29:22] Brother David would have picked me up
[1:29:26] and said okay take me out to the runway
[1:29:28] and set me in the cockpit of a real F-16
[1:29:31] . I said all right take off
[1:29:33] I'd be like well it will no maybe that
[1:29:36] was fun the video game was fun but I
[1:29:37] don't really I don't really think that I
[1:29:39] want to do that
[1:29:41] because now my life
[1:29:43] is on the line
[1:29:46] and it's the same thing with so many
[1:29:48] so-called Christians today yeah well we
[1:29:51] got a good pastor yeah we got a good
[1:29:52] church yeah I I I
[1:29:54] um
[1:29:55] I read my Bible sometimes and I pray
[1:29:58] sometimes and everything's all good
[1:30:01] but wait a minute I don't know if I want
[1:30:03] to sit in that cockpit
[1:30:05] same thing happened in the book of
[1:30:07] Exodus
[1:30:08] when they came up to the mountain Moses
[1:30:11] the prophet was so excited and he's like
[1:30:13] you're gonna meet God today
[1:30:17] get ready sanctify yourselves because
[1:30:19] you're gonna meet God
[1:30:21] and then they go up and they see the
[1:30:23] thundering and the lightning and they
[1:30:25] see the pillar of fire there and they're
[1:30:27] like wait a minute
[1:30:29] we'll just take a man
[1:30:32] because
[1:30:33] if God speaks then we'll die
[1:30:36] so we'll just we'll just take what a man
[1:30:38] says and we'll just we'll just we'll
[1:30:40] just believe what that man says
[1:30:43] that man was Moses
[1:30:47] that was a grave mistake so what does
[1:30:49] God say the Eternal God he says okay
[1:30:52] from now on if that's what you want if
[1:30:54] you don't want to talk to me
[1:30:56] I'll send you I'll send you a prophet
[1:30:58] I'll speak through him or maybe I'll
[1:30:59] send you a pastor and I'll speak to him
[1:31:01] I was speaking good I'll give you good
[1:31:02] parents and I'll speak to them
[1:31:05] because Lord I don't know if I really
[1:31:08] want to step into a complete
[1:31:11] sanctification a complete separation
[1:31:14] from the world I don't know if I really
[1:31:16] want to do that so I'll just go through
[1:31:18] the motions and and the Lord can be my
[1:31:20] savior but he's not going to be
[1:31:22] my ruler
[1:31:24] how many
[1:31:26] how many of us think that way
[1:31:29] how many of us know it is right to do
[1:31:33] something or to not do something and yet
[1:31:36] we forsake it
[1:31:39] just because we want our way rather than
[1:31:43] God's way
[1:31:44] how many
[1:31:47] I'll close if the musicians could come I
[1:31:49] want to close
[1:31:52] with a chapter I read a lot
[1:31:56] because it means so much to me it's it's
[1:31:58] in the Book of John and it's it's Jesus
[1:32:03] and it's the last recorded prayer that
[1:32:05] we have of the Lord Jesus in The Book of
[1:32:07] John
[1:32:09] and
[1:32:12] Jesus didn't want us to be flying around
[1:32:15] in a simulator
[1:32:17] or playing a video game
[1:32:19] that simulator is good
[1:32:21] when we're raising our kids
[1:32:24] it's good don't do this do this don't do
[1:32:27] that don't do this that simulator gets
[1:32:30] us to where we can maybe fly the jet in
[1:32:32] the future
[1:32:33] but it's still a video game
[1:32:36] it's still not real
[1:32:39] but let me read to you
[1:32:42] the ultimate pilot
[1:32:45] what he said in John chapter 17 the Lord
[1:32:49] is praying for his disciples and he's
[1:32:51] praying for all of us too
[1:32:53] this is right before he goes to the
[1:32:55] Garden of the Gethsemane right before he
[1:32:57] is taken to the cross
[1:32:59] John chapter 17 verse 16.
[1:33:06] Jesus
[1:33:08] praying
[1:33:10] to the father
[1:33:14] they are not of the world
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:18] even as I am not of the world
[1:33:21] sanctify them through thy truth
[1:33:25] Thy word is truth
[1:33:29] as thou has sent me into the world even
[1:33:32] so have I also sent them into the world
[1:33:39] pretty soon
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:42] the day of Pentecost was going to come
[1:33:45] and they were going to sit in that
[1:33:46] fighter jet
[1:33:49] that engine was going to come on
[1:33:53] those afterburners were going to go and
[1:33:55] they were going to leave that Runway
[1:33:57] filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:34:02] listen to this
[1:34:06] our lord Jesus saying this and for their
[1:34:09] sakes
[1:34:11] I sanctify myself
[1:34:14] that they also maybe might be Sanctified
[1:34:17] through the truth
[1:34:20] the Lord Jesus
[1:34:22] it could have been anything that he
[1:34:23] wanted he was a man he was God made
[1:34:25] flesh he could have made any choice
[1:34:29] any career anything he wanted to do he
[1:34:32] was given free moral agency as we are
[1:34:35] and he said this I sanctify myself
[1:34:39] sister Jessica your song
[1:34:41] it wasn't for us
[1:34:44] it was for other people
[1:34:46] the reason I lived the life that I live
[1:34:52] is for other people
[1:34:57] like these sisters that were in
[1:34:58] McDonald's
[1:35:00] living a Sanctified life living a life
[1:35:02] that that was above reproach and
[1:35:05] kindness and gentleness and love not not
[1:35:07] not condemning and and and preaching and
[1:35:11] and getting on people but living a life
[1:35:14] that was full of love and it brought
[1:35:17] someone
[1:35:18] to the Lord Jesus because
[1:35:21] that woman saw something real
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:25] saw somebody that wasn't just playing a
[1:35:27] video game that was actually flying a
[1:35:29] fighter jet
[1:35:32] Jesus says neither pray I for these
[1:35:36] alone
[1:35:37] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[1:35:40] me through their word
[1:35:42] that they all may be one
[1:35:44] as thou father are in me and I in thee
[1:35:48] that they also maybe won
[1:35:50] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:35:52] sent me
[1:35:54] why
[1:35:57] do we live
[1:35:59] do we do our best to live a holy life
[1:36:03] why do we
[1:36:05] why do we pray say Lord I want to live
[1:36:08] my life
[1:36:10] pleasing to you why do we why do we do
[1:36:13] that the real relationship with Christ
[1:36:15] is not through the organization or the
[1:36:17] organization's way of thinking
[1:36:21] where you have to talk like this and
[1:36:22] dress like that but the individual
[1:36:25] relationship with Christ is where it's
[1:36:27] at and that's when he speaks to us
[1:36:32] that's when it grabs a hold
[1:36:37] we can put our kids in the simulator and
[1:36:39] it's good
[1:36:41] teach them
[1:36:42] get them get them to where they
[1:36:44] understand the word
[1:36:46] flying around and that it made me learn
[1:36:49] the learn the um
[1:36:51] the levers and the gauges
[1:36:55] but when
[1:36:58] I said I'd asked Brother David I said
[1:37:00] what's the difference between the
[1:37:03] simulation
[1:37:04] and the real thing
[1:37:06] and he says he says he says they're
[1:37:09] exactly the same
[1:37:10] he said but but when you're actually
[1:37:13] flying
[1:37:15] he says you can feel the airplane
[1:37:17] beneath you you can feel it Flex he says
[1:37:20] you can feel the wind speed he says you
[1:37:23] can feel all of these these different
[1:37:25] things that aren't in the simulator you
[1:37:27] have to look at the gauges in the
[1:37:28] simulator but when you're actually in
[1:37:30] the jet you can feel the stuff
[1:37:33] it's real
[1:37:38] and if we are not there
[1:37:42] then friends ask yourself Lord am I in a
[1:37:47] simulation
[1:37:48] that dream let me tell you if there's
[1:37:50] anything that's been in my life that's
[1:37:52] from God it was then
[1:37:55] it shook me up as a 19 year old boy
[1:37:59] it started the changing of my life and
[1:38:02] and as the years went by it's I
[1:38:05] struggled with it and I had many
[1:38:07] different interpretations of it I said
[1:38:08] oh this must be that that must be this
[1:38:10] and then boom I saw it
[1:38:15] and it
[1:38:16] it was I was in a simulation
[1:38:20] because it wasn't real
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:24] and I was standing I was standing right
[1:38:28] there at the edge
[1:38:30] and the Lord came in and saved me right
[1:38:33] before I was lost
[1:38:38] don't take
[1:38:41] don't take something that's that's not
[1:38:43] real friends it may be it may be all
[1:38:46] have all the the look of something real
[1:38:49] but if you're not really in the jet if
[1:38:52] you're not really taking off then it's
[1:38:54] just a simulation of Christianity don't
[1:38:57] let it be that you keep going
[1:39:00] we're going to hear testimonies tonight
[1:39:03] I want to hear testimonies of how your
[1:39:05] candle got lit I want to hear
[1:39:07] testimonies of this is how it became
[1:39:09] real to me
[1:39:12] and make sure
[1:39:15] as we give testimonies tonight
[1:39:17] sing songs of praise make sure it is
[1:39:19] real to you
[1:39:21] because people are watching
[1:39:25] and if I'm claiming to be a Christian if
[1:39:28] I'm claiming to be a believer if I'm
[1:39:30] claiming these things and I don't have
[1:39:32] the life to back it up what good is it
[1:39:35] going to do
[1:39:37] it's not about me
[1:39:40] as Jesus said I Sanctified myself for
[1:39:43] what so I can go to heaven
[1:39:45] Jesus said I sanctify myself for them
[1:39:50] and if you have the same Spirit of
[1:39:52] Christ that Jesus had
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:55] then you will be the same way
[1:39:57] Lord I do my best
[1:40:00] not for myself or do you save me
[1:40:04] I do my I do my best for them
[1:40:07] that's why I live my life that's what I
[1:40:09] do what I do for other people
[1:40:13] and that's the life of a Christian
[1:40:15] it's a life I want to live
[1:40:21] there's um

[1:41:25] the church is a hip to the church is a
[1:41:28] hypocrite
[1:41:30] that doesn't live the life
[1:41:32] behind what they're saying
[1:41:35] that's what hinders us
[1:41:38] follow follow the lord live that
[1:41:42] consecrated life whatever he requires
[1:41:45] do it one of the things that he requires
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:51] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:55] something that Jesus said he said go out
[1:41:57] and make disciples
[1:42:00] Make Disciples of what of your church
[1:42:04] Make Disciples of me of Christ
[1:42:07] teach them about me
[1:42:09] Make Disciples of them
[1:42:12] baptizing them in the name
[1:42:15] of the father and of the son
[1:42:18] and of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:22] baptized them lead them
[1:42:26] to the Lord
[1:42:28] the disciples took that commandment
[1:42:30] seriously
[1:42:32] Matthew 28 19.
[1:42:34] they took it seriously
[1:42:37] first thing first thing they did
[1:42:40] after they received that same Spirit of
[1:42:42] Christ Peter said repent every one of
[1:42:45] you and be baptized
[1:42:47] in the name
[1:42:50] Jesus Christ
[1:42:52] Peter with the revelation
[1:42:54] Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
[1:42:58] their God
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:02] and God has a name
[1:43:05] associated with him
[1:43:07] and that name is Jesus
[1:43:10] he ascended up to the right hand of the
[1:43:12] father
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:15] if you have a need to be baptized if you
[1:43:17] would like to be baptized it'd be a good
[1:43:18] time today to do it
[1:43:21] brother

[1:43:24] brother Tony we have we have somebody to
[1:43:26] be baptized
[1:43:28] good if you would go back and if there's
[1:43:30] anybody else go back and see brother Ed
[1:43:32] back there
[1:43:33] if there's anyone else

[1:51:44] [Music]
[1:51:55] that um
[1:51:58] I am especially blessed
[1:52:01] this morning I love baptizing people I
[1:52:03] love it when someone makes a decision
[1:52:06] and as I talked about just now that
[1:52:09] that Jesus commanded us
[1:52:11] to be baptized
[1:52:14] Peter's told us that we are baptized
[1:52:18] for the removing for the taking away of
[1:52:20] our sins
[1:52:22] for the remission of sins as it says in
[1:52:24] the Bible
[1:52:26] and I really appreciate it when someone
[1:52:29] comes and when someone is prepared and
[1:52:32] when someone has thought it out even as
[1:52:34] a Young Man
[1:52:37] it's young Maddox
[1:52:41] he drew a picture
[1:52:43] and you can't see it very well
[1:52:46] obviously it's far away but it's a it's
[1:52:49] a beautiful mountain scene and it's a
[1:52:52] river running through there
[1:52:54] and there's a gravestone there
[1:52:57] and it looks like a fresh grave it's
[1:52:59] near this tree
[1:53:04] and it says
[1:53:08] said old sins it says old sins on the
[1:53:12] gravestone
[1:53:15] I think the young man has a good
[1:53:17] understanding of what baptism is for
[1:53:21] he wrote this
[1:53:23] he said he knew I was going to ask him
[1:53:25] this and he says what baptism means to
[1:53:28] me
[1:53:29] is it means that you are leaving your
[1:53:31] sins behind and you're letting Christ
[1:53:34] into your life
[1:53:38] you bring the Holy Spirit into you and
[1:53:42] with you
[1:53:44] when you let Christ into your life
[1:53:49] that's basically starting a new life
[1:53:52] with Christ in that new life
[1:53:56] that is starting a new Christ yeah I
[1:53:59] would say we should clap for that
[1:54:03] [Applause]
[1:54:12] in front of all of these people
[1:54:14] and by your own testimony you're coming
[1:54:16] into these Waters
[1:54:18] to tell everyone I am now a Christian
[1:54:23] and my sins are washed away in the blood
[1:54:26] of Jesus Christ you believe that raise
[1:54:28] your hand
[1:54:29] you believe it if you do raise your hand
[1:54:31] yeah
[1:54:32] brother Maddox
[1:54:34] if you you can hold your nose or you and
[1:54:36] you can grab my hand right here
[1:54:39] I'll put you down under the water
[1:54:41] it is a great honor this young man
[1:54:44] who has more of an understanding of
[1:54:46] baptism than probably many Through the
[1:54:49] Ages that have ever been baptized
[1:54:52] problematics
[1:54:53] I baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:54:56] Jesus Christ
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:55:08] unless this young man
[1:55:10] father may your Holy Spirit go before
[1:55:12] him
[1:55:14] May the spirit guide him and protect him
[1:55:17] father may he if you would tarry may he
[1:55:21] lead souls to you
[1:55:23] in Jesus Christ's name
[1:55:27] [Applause]
[1:55:36] thank you
[1:55:40] foreign
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:56:05] come here he just told me he says I was
[1:56:07] baptized when I was young and
[1:56:12] I really didn't know what it meant
[1:56:15] I'm going to let you speak
[1:56:19] God bless you all
[1:56:21] uh
[1:56:23] so I was yeah I was baptized as a baby

[1:56:40] cockpit
[1:56:44] that's good
[1:56:48] Tony
[1:56:50] the Bible teaches us
[1:56:52] that we in Romans I believe is chapter
[1:56:55] six that we go down into this water
[1:56:58] and it represents the grave and we come
[1:57:00] out a resurrected being a new being with
[1:57:04] our sins washed away in the blood of
[1:57:06] Jesus Christ

[1:57:38] Lord Jesus Christ

[1:58:06] the baptismal pool right now

[1:58:19] doesn't it feel good to see there's
[1:58:21] there's this thing called repentance
[1:58:24] and that repents is it's the Bible says
[1:58:28] that we are cut in our heart
[1:58:30] and we want to make all things right

[1:58:35] real and according to his word
