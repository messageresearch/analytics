[38:30] happier it'll make you more successful
[38:33] it'll just brother it will give you so
[38:35] much so welcome to church welcome to the
[38:38] Tucson Tabernacle do you
[38:45] appreciate um before I I mentioned this
[38:48] morning that I want to read uh the
[38:49] testimony that I asked brother Adam
[38:52] sister Amelia's son I asked him to write
[38:54] down his testimony and I'd like to read
[38:56] it before the church because I think
[38:57] it'd be a blessing to all of us um
[39:00] before we get into that I'd like to say
[39:02] a few words on something that has been
[39:05] on my heart and it does tie into Adam's
[39:09] testimony a little bit there are some
[39:11] people maybe here that uh have
[39:15] experienced some of this um maybe
[39:18] control is is the best word for it but I
[39:22] want to
[39:23] read a chapter in the Bible
[39:28] um and maybe just let the congregation
[39:32] I'll say a few words about it but maybe
[39:34] just let the congregation make your
[39:37] own um decision on on what the Apostle
[39:41] meant
[39:43] here and what it comes down to what it
[39:46] comes I guess the word is
[39:51] excommunication or taking someone out
[39:55] from under the blood of Jesus
[39:57] Christ and this morning's message I had
[40:01] in there I ran out of time I was short
[40:03] on time I had in there I wanted to say a
[40:05] few words about this 1 Corinthians
[40:08] chapter 5 and and bring it before the
[40:10] congregation but um I wanted to keep it
[40:13] in my time slot and I didn't say it but
[40:15] I'd like to just take a few minutes and
[40:18] talk about what this excommunication is
[40:20] or what this taking someone out from
[40:22] under the blood of Jesus Christ is there
[40:24] is scripture for it so so we need to
[40:28] make sure that we're not just we get a
[40:30] bad taste in our in our mouth and and we
[40:33] have some bad memories we want to make
[40:34] sure that we don't run away from the
[40:36] scriptures even though maybe we have
[40:38] been done wrong and this excommunication
[40:43] really it's uh it's it's really a spirit
[40:46] of control and it's very very strong and
[40:49] today and don't kid yourself just as
[40:53] strong today in the Catholic church as
[40:54] it has ever been the Catholic
[40:58] Church they obviously they Spawn from
[41:02] the original uh Church of Rome the
[41:04] Christian church and they have taken the
[41:10] scriptures and
[41:12] and dominated the people with it it's a
[41:15] it's a spirit of domination that that
[41:18] really fuels this church and it's it's
[41:21] the same today I was talking with uh
[41:23] sister Jessica's dad last night brother
[41:26] um Figaroa and he was telling me that uh
[41:30] now I don't want to misquote the pope
[41:33] but brother brother figuro was telling
[41:36] me that the pope said that all
[41:40] doors lead to God talking about the
[41:43] different
[41:45] religions and it sounds good especially
[41:48] in the woke culture that we have today
[41:51] it's like oh just if you're a good
[41:53] person and and you may be a Buddhist or
[41:55] you may be a Muslim or you may be a
[41:57] Hindu just be a good person and you'll
[41:59] eventually get to God that is against
[42:01] the
[42:02] scriptures that is against what we call
[42:06] Christianity Jesus himself said I am the
[42:10] way the truth and the life and no man
[42:14] can come to the father except by me that
[42:18] includes if you're a Hindu and you have
[42:21] never heard of Christianity out in the
[42:23] Villages of India it includes
[42:28] everyone you have to come through Jesus
[42:31] Christ how that will be sorted out at
[42:33] the end I don't know that's up to
[42:37] Jesus he also said that I am the door to
[42:40] the
[42:42] Sheepfold and you want to talk about a
[42:44] door there's only one door to God and
[42:47] it's not through anyone other than the
[42:50] Lord Jesus but when a church comes in
[42:54] and the leadership comes in and they try
[42:57] to control the people and you look at
[43:00] this Pope that we have now and what he's
[43:03] doing is he's opening up all of these
[43:06] doors to all of these really sinful ways
[43:09] and he's saying basically it's it's all
[43:12] good it's okay but let me tell you
[43:15] something you try to protest the
[43:17] Catholic Church one time to him and you
[43:20] see how well it goes for you there's a
[43:22] long history of people protesting in the
[43:25] Catholic church and most of them ended
[43:27] up up at the stake or on the
[43:29] cross uh John
[43:31] Wickliffe he protested the Catholic
[43:34] church he said the people should be able
[43:36] to read the Bible and you know what they
[43:38] did with him they censured him which is
[43:40] like excommunication they censured him
[43:42] and they burned him at the
[43:44] stake then came along this man named
[43:47] Martin Luther said the same thing John
[43:49] hus said the same thing they burned John
[43:53] hust at the stake he prophesied of one
[43:55] coming after him 100
[43:57] years later his prophecy was fulfilled
[43:59] in Martin Luther Martin Luther comes and
[44:01] he protests the Catholic church he said
[44:04] he said here are 99 reasons why you're
[44:06] wrong and they wanted to burn him at the
[44:09] stake they excommunicated him which is
[44:10] the worst thing that you can do to
[44:11] someone is you take them out from under
[44:13] the blood they say of Jesus and it's a
[44:17] frightening thing is it not for those of
[44:19] you who have been through it or been
[44:22] party to it it's scary because these are
[44:26] your friends these are your family these
[44:29] are the people that you love very much
[44:31] and these are the people that are
[44:32] shunning you
[44:34] now it's a very frightening thing it
[44:36] happened to Martin Luther he wasn't
[44:37] burned to the Stak but his contemporary
[44:39] William tendale who stood by what Martin
[44:41] Luther said and he says now I want to
[44:44] translate the Bible into these people
[44:46] that speak English in England and they
[44:48] burned him at the stake protesting the
[44:51] Catholic Church disagreeing with what
[44:54] they
[44:55] say and he Here Comes judgment when you
[44:59] do that here comes
[45:01] excommunication and these were Christian
[45:03] men and women Jonah Arc burned at the
[45:08] stake for her stand it wasn't just men
[45:12] women too probably just as many women as
[45:16] men burned at the stake killed because
[45:19] they protested the Catholic Church they
[45:21] went against what the church said so
[45:24] they did this thing called
[45:26] excommunication
[45:27] sometimes we'll call it taking it out
[45:29] from underneath the blood as I said
[45:32] there is scripture for it and I want to
[45:34] read this scripture and I want you to
[45:37] make the decision on what the scriptures
[45:39] really say we need to be able to dig
[45:42] into this Bible and we need to be able
[45:45] to on our
[45:47] own understand it it is a Catholic
[45:51] doctrine that a priest has to tell you
[45:54] what it means or a prophet or anything
[45:56] else
[45:57] the holy spirit is The Interpreter let
[45:59] me quote a great man if you don't know
[46:02] his name his name's brother
[46:06] brandom he said God is his own
[46:09] interpreter do you believe that so if
[46:12] God is his own interpreter I don't I can
[46:16] understand it now that's we have
[46:19] ministers and we have teachers and that
[46:21] that help us to understand but in the
[46:23] end all of us make our own decisions and
[46:26] that is what that Spirit hates that
[46:29] Spirit does not want you to have that
[46:32] relationship with God that Spirit wants
[46:35] you
[46:36] under Mama
[46:38] church that doesn't mean churches are
[46:40] wrong churches are are I'm a pastor of a
[46:43] church we're all members of the church
[46:45] we love the
[46:46] church that's not trying to take away
[46:49] churches or saying that you shouldn't
[46:50] Fellowship what that is saying is no you
[46:55] are under Jesus Christ
[46:57] Christ believe it's 1 Corinthians
[47:00] 11 set says Christ is the head of the
[47:06] man
[47:08] now there's nobody in between
[47:10] there Christ is the head of the man and
[47:14] then if you if you look
[47:17] further that that Jesus is that
[47:21] relationship it's that is that's my
[47:25] Ministry is get to Jesus listen to
[47:29] him and what happens
[47:33] is this taking out from under the blood
[47:37] what I have
[47:39] seen is it is because you disagree with
[47:44] the way that the church is
[47:46] thinking and I do not believe that that
[47:49] is what it was intended
[47:52] for by any
[47:54] means the church May Define sin as as
[47:59] one thing but somebody may not be
[48:02] condemned but still wanting to serve the
[48:04] Lord and may not see it that way and if
[48:07] you don't see it like me then I would
[48:10] come and say Zeke you're out of this
[48:13] church you are not to come in here
[48:15] anymore you are not to fellowship with
[48:17] him and that would be a dominating
[48:20] spirit and that would be
[48:22] wrong when I know Ezekiel he wants to
[48:25] serve God but he may not see it like
[48:28] me but as long as we are focusing on
[48:32] Jesus Christ that is where it's
[48:36] at and then you see this elitist
[48:40] mentality that that breathes this
[48:44] conflict and
[48:46] hatred and
[48:48] that's really it's in direct contrast to
[48:53] the
[48:54] gospels it's in direct contrast to the
[48:57] spirit of Jesus Christ the main thing is
[49:01] that we are doing our best to serve God
[49:03] we we have it on our hearts like I
[49:05] talked about the three Parables the
[49:07] three different situations this morning
[49:09] that little sheep wanted to serve
[49:13] God and then that prodigal
[49:16] son he left on his own he wasn't kicked
[49:22] out by Mom and
[49:23] Dad he left he left the the faith it was
[49:28] his
[49:30] choice I
[49:33] believe most of this comes from 1
[49:37] Corinthians chapter
[49:40] 5 and that's where I want to read before
[49:43] we get to brother Adam's letter and we
[49:45] have to remember do you remember from
[49:47] our book of Acts our Bible study
[49:49] brothers and sisters Bible study is
[49:50] important Wednesday nights are important
[49:53] if you can't get here listen to them
[49:56] because you're going to learn something
[49:58] we learn in the book of Acts that this
[50:00] city of Corinth what was
[50:03] it
[50:06] filth did you say Las Vegas Sin
[50:10] City that's what Corinth
[50:13] was sexually immoral
[50:18] place this is the book to the
[50:21] Corinthians meaning they live in Corinth
[50:25] it's the church there
[50:27] now Paul is writing this 1 Corinthians
[50:30] chapter 5:1 he says it is commonly
[50:33] reported that there is fornication among
[50:35] you and such fornication as in as is not
[50:40] so much named among the Gentiles that
[50:42] one should have his father's wife so
[50:44] what he's saying is you live in this
[50:46] Gentile city of Corinth it's a filthy
[50:49] dirty City but even they don't seek sink
[50:52] this low even those filthy people that
[50:55] have worship all all these gods and do
[50:57] all this stuff wrong even they are not
[51:00] sinking to this
[51:02] immorality and the Apostle Paul says but
[51:04] you are Church in Corinth what's the
[51:08] matter with
[51:09] you and you are puffed
[51:12] up and have not rather
[51:15] mourned that he that have done this deed
[51:18] might be taken away from
[51:21] you so he's like you're too proud and
[51:23] all this you should be Mourning
[51:27] you should be sad that you have a man in
[51:31] this
[51:33] church that is sleeping with his
[51:37] stepmother and that's where all of this
[51:39] is started it's coming from
[51:43] immorality sexual immorality let's
[51:46] continue for verily for I verily as
[51:49] absent in body but present in spirit
[51:52] have judged already as though I were
[51:55] present concerning him that hath done
[51:57] this deed Paul was
[51:59] awesome he was so cool he's the one that
[52:03] started this church he's the one that
[52:05] got it going and he comes in and he
[52:07] introduces him to Christ and he's like
[52:08] listen you respect
[52:10] me I am absent from you in body I either
[52:14] whether he was in prison or whether he
[52:15] was traveling I'm not sure where he was
[52:18] at this time I think he was traveling
[52:19] but he wasn't present with them but he
[52:22] says I'm with you in spirit I love you I
[52:25] love you Church
[52:27] church but I as not as not being with
[52:32] you in body but present in spirits I
[52:34] have judged this so he's acting as the
[52:37] pastor here this isn't a voter of the
[52:39] church this is the pastor asserting
[52:42] Authority and he's saying that this man
[52:47] that had done this deed might be taken
[52:50] from
[52:53] you for verily I say is absent in body
[52:56] but presid in spirit I've already judged
[52:57] this as though I were present concerning
[52:59] him that had done this deed in the name
[53:01] of our Lord Jesus that's
[53:04] important he's saying I am speaking for
[53:08] Jesus Christ when we pray over our food
[53:11] Lord please bless this food in Jesus
[53:13] name
[53:15] whoa you're speaking for Jesus Christ
[53:19] here every little prayer in jesus' name
[53:23] it should be
[53:25] revered and here here he's saying in the
[53:28] name of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm
[53:30] speaking on his behalf when you are
[53:32] gathered together in my spirit with the
[53:34] power of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[53:37] deliver such a one unto Satan for the
[53:40] destruction of the flesh that the spirit
[53:42] may be saved in the day of the Lord
[53:45] Jesus so what he's saying here is this
[53:47] is an act of mercy so what's going to
[53:49] happen here is you turn this man who is
[53:54] sinning filthy sinning you turn him over
[53:59] to the
[54:00] devil and then he gets
[54:04] sick and then he suffers sickness in his
[54:09] body or something happens in his body I
[54:12] talked this
[54:13] morning
[54:15] about when the prodigal son left that
[54:19] the parents should pull back and let him
[54:23] go don't enable him when you do that you
[54:29] are taking that wonderful
[54:32] influence of a Godly mother and father
[54:35] or a godly
[54:37] church and they leave and you pull back
[54:42] from that and this good influence and
[54:45] these good friends and he leaves and he
[54:48] walks away from it and you don't chase
[54:50] him down of course he's going to have
[54:53] problems duh
[54:56] the good things in his life the positive
[54:58] influence in his life are
[55:00] gone that's not excommunicating someone
[55:03] that's not taking them out from under
[55:04] the
[55:05] blood that is just saying okay you can
[55:10] leave I'll always be here you can always
[55:12] come back you're always welcome in
[55:14] church you're always welcome to be with
[55:17] us in our family but you have left and
[55:19] I'm not going to chase after you because
[55:21] if you chase after him that good
[55:22] influence follows you and you're still
[55:25] helping him and you're still enabling
[55:26] him and he's still wanting to sin he
[55:28] doesn't want to come back and you're
[55:30] making it easy for
[55:31] him but that's not this scripture right
[55:35] here this
[55:37] scripture is
[55:40] uh is someone that's bringing sin into
[55:44] the church not someone that disagrees
[55:46] with the
[55:47] church your gloring is not good know ye
[55:51] that A little leaven leavens a whole
[55:54] lump the Amplified version says your
[55:57] boasting over the supposed spirituality
[56:00] of your church is not good indeed it is
[56:04] vulgar and
[56:06] inappropriate do you not know that just
[56:09] a little leaven ferments the whole batch
[56:12] of dough just as a little sin corrupts a
[56:15] person or an entire
[56:18] church so this person that this is
[56:21] talking about is bringing sin in and
[56:26] spreading it among the
[56:28] people not The Parables I talked about
[56:32] this
[56:33] morning Purge therefore out the old
[56:36] leaven that you may be a new lump as you
[56:39] are leaven for even Christ Our Passover
[56:42] is sacrificed for
[56:45] us
[56:47] therefore let us keep the feast not with
[56:51] old leaven neither with the leaven of
[56:53] malice and of wickedness but with the
[56:56] unleavened bread of sincerity and
[57:00] truth I wrote unto you in an epistle not
[57:04] to company with
[57:08] fornicators
[57:10] remember what was going on in
[57:13] Corinth the filth Sin City as as brother
[57:17] Lyall said a modern day Las Vegas what's
[57:19] going on there and then he's saying that
[57:21] you this is even lower than than the
[57:24] street people this is bad people that
[57:27] don't even know Christ or any other real
[57:29] God this is this is completely immoral
[57:32] and you're being
[57:34] worse this is being worse and he says
[57:38] not to and now he's trying to bring it
[57:40] into the church and spread it among the
[57:42] church don't company with that filthy
[57:46] that
[57:47] filthiness the
[57:49] um Amplified says I wrote to you in my
[57:52] previous letter not to associate with
[57:55] the sexual immoral
[57:57] people because it's bringing it's it's
[58:00] causing problems in your families it's
[58:02] causing problems in the
[58:04] church yet not altogether with the forn
[58:07] fornicators of this world or with the
[58:09] Covetous or with the extortioners or
[58:11] with the idolators for then must ye
[58:14] needs go out of the
[58:16] world not meaning the immoral people of
[58:18] this world or the greedy ones and the
[58:20] swinders idolators then you would have
[58:23] to get out of the world and Human
[58:25] Society all
[58:26] together saying you don't have to cut
[58:29] everybody
[58:30] off but now I have written to you not to
[58:33] keep Company If any man that is called a
[58:36] brother be a fornicator or Covetous or
[58:39] an idolator or a or a drunkard or
[58:42] an extortioner with such a one not to
[58:53] eat for what have I to do to judge them
[58:58] also that are without do not ye judge
[59:01] them that are
[59:03] within me read the Amplified says for
[59:06] what business is it of mine to judge
[59:08] Outsiders
[59:10] non-believers do you not judge those who
[59:13] are within the church to protect the
[59:16] church as the situation
[59:19] requires not just if you not if you
[59:23] disagree with the doctrine
[59:27] not if there is sin in your life
[59:29] everyone has sin in their life I'm not
[59:31] condoning it it's wrong get it out of
[59:33] your life but we all fail but you don't
[59:36] kick them out because of that he's
[59:39] saying they're bringing in and it's
[59:44] spreading but them that are without God
[59:47] judgeth therefore put away from among
[59:49] yourselves that Wicked person
[59:56] Amplified version says God Alone sits in
[59:59] the judgment on those who are outside
[1:00:01] the faith remove the wicked one from
[1:00:04] among you and expel him from your
[1:00:07] church so I'll let you make the
[1:00:12] decision that when we see some of
[1:00:16] this as I said take him out from under
[1:00:18] the blood kick him out of church and
[1:00:20] doing all
[1:00:21] this is it according to that is it
[1:00:26] according to this
[1:00:28] word just because they're doing
[1:00:30] something that maybe the church doesn't
[1:00:31] teach or maybe the church condemns just
[1:00:34] because they brother Aaron what did you
[1:00:37] say you said something when we were in
[1:00:39] the back that they kick that people get
[1:00:42] kicked out
[1:00:45] for brother aon's been there sister
[1:00:48] Millie's been there the brother sister
[1:00:51] Elizabeth the brother that I'm going to
[1:00:53] read his letter he's been there and let
[1:00:54] me tell you it harms
[1:00:58] and even
[1:01:00] today it's still a struggle even for
[1:01:03] brother
[1:01:04] Adam and it's it's made a scar in his
[1:01:08] life because of that fear and I've been
[1:01:14] there it's a fear that falls upon you
[1:01:19] that you don't you don't want anybody to
[1:01:21] see you do anything that was what it was
[1:01:24] that you don't want anybody
[1:01:26] whether where you are at the grocery
[1:01:28] store like I told you in Costco or
[1:01:30] whever if somebody sees you
[1:01:32] fellowshipping with this person over
[1:01:34] here who has been shunned now you are
[1:01:36] responsible and you always live under
[1:01:38] that
[1:01:40] fear and it's
[1:01:42] it's it's fear is
[1:01:45] wrong you respect and you fear
[1:01:48] God but no you do not have to fear
[1:01:51] anything in this world I don't care if
[1:01:52] it's sickness death or what some
[1:01:55] somebody else thinks of you you be
[1:01:59] right and don't worry about that
[1:02:04] stuff and I can even see it in some of
[1:02:07] the letters that I receive and some of
[1:02:09] the people that I that I talk to I can
[1:02:11] see that they still have that fear it's
[1:02:13] been so ingrained and pounded into
[1:02:17] them that you are under this
[1:02:21] church and we have taken you out from
[1:02:23] under the blood
[1:02:26] for the destruction of your flesh so
[1:02:29] that your soul may be
[1:02:31] saved because you did something wrong or
[1:02:35] you had sin in your life that is not
[1:02:37] according to the scripture when that
[1:02:40] happens and let me tell you one of the
[1:02:43] most common things in this Bible to
[1:02:45] remove somebody from you guess what it
[1:02:48] is
[1:02:50] gossip that's that's one of the things
[1:02:53] you bring it in and you hurt the church
[1:02:57] it's not having a television or going to
[1:02:59] a movie or even or even someone that has
[1:03:02] an addiction or something like
[1:03:05] that it's harming the
[1:03:08] body and that is what it's
[1:03:11] about don't fear and if you have
[1:03:14] anything like that in your history
[1:03:16] brothers and sisters never fear that
[1:03:18] never let that fear rise up let me tell
[1:03:21] you Jesus Christ wipes that away and you
[1:03:24] are not subject to anything in your past
[1:03:28] our past is
[1:03:30] clean because we have accepted the way
[1:03:33] the truth and the life we have accepted
[1:03:37] Jesus
[1:03:38] Christ and he is our savior he's the
[1:03:42] only savior there's no other and with
[1:03:45] this Pope is saying if he said it that
[1:03:48] all doors lead to God no they don't
[1:03:50] there's only one that does and I want to
[1:03:52] go in that door in fact I have gone in
[1:03:55] that
[1:03:57] door and I would encourage everyone to
[1:04:01] follow that
[1:04:03] door brother Adam sister Amelia's son
[1:04:07] brother Jordan were you able to get that
[1:04:09] picture excellent want to see who we're
[1:04:12] talking about
[1:04:15] here there he
[1:04:17] is Adam
[1:04:19] Gonzalez he's uh s how many kids do you
[1:04:23] have
[1:04:26] four and what number is
[1:04:31] he oh he's the youngest
[1:04:33] okay there he
[1:04:36] is and that's who wrote this absolutely
[1:04:40] beautiful letter and I asked him I said
[1:04:43] I said brother I said sometimes on
[1:04:46] Sunday nights we do um we do
[1:04:50] testimonies and I said I'd really like
[1:04:52] to read your testimony I think it would
[1:04:54] be blessing to all of us and I had it on
[1:04:57] my heart to preach on the prodigal
[1:05:00] son and I thought that everything just
[1:05:04] kind of lined up perfectly for this
[1:05:08] testimony but Adam says this dearly
[1:05:13] beloved greetings in the name greetings
[1:05:17] in Christ Jesus what an honor and
[1:05:19] privilege he's writing by the way he's
[1:05:21] not writing to me he's writing to all of
[1:05:24] us he knows that this is going to be
[1:05:27] read what an honor and privilege to
[1:05:29] write a few words from sender to
[1:05:32] receiver the mystical Body of Christ
[1:05:34] just think of all those prophets and the
[1:05:37] writings maybe not knowing the Years
[1:05:39] it'll reach all the years it'll travel
[1:05:42] look at the outcome and the impact it's
[1:05:44] still alive and breathing he's talking
[1:05:46] about this Bible I'm living proof so I
[1:05:49] must Proclaim it name it and live it
[1:05:52] like these Great Men of faith not only
[1:05:55] not only they wrote what we have as the
[1:05:59] word today they spoke of things that are
[1:06:02] to come and that shall come of things
[1:06:05] that we are to do and not to do then
[1:06:09] like the children of Israel they were
[1:06:11] used as examples to us of what not to do
[1:06:15] we read that in the book of Hebrews the
[1:06:17] 4th chapter let us therefore make every
[1:06:20] effort to enter into that rest so that
[1:06:22] no one will fall by following their
[1:06:24] example of Disobedience not only is
[1:06:27] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:06:29] forever so are these
[1:06:32] examples so are these examples for
[1:06:34] instance in Jesus's day it was the
[1:06:37] intellectuals of that day who practiced
[1:06:39] the Law Men known as the
[1:06:42] Pharisees but could not recognize the
[1:06:44] Living Word right in front of them we
[1:06:46] still have these examples right before
[1:06:48] us today right here in prison they
[1:06:51] reject the word well what I want to say
[1:06:54] is I'm a living example just like the
[1:06:57] children of Israel we don't have to look
[1:06:59] back for it's right here before us see a
[1:07:02] brother nonetheless but a brother
[1:07:04] nonetheless but one who is an example of
[1:07:07] Disobedience talking about
[1:07:10] himself I take no pride in
[1:07:12] this it's shameful but B but bear with
[1:07:16] me here let me take you a little while
[1:07:19] back through the corridor of time this
[1:07:21] is a short testimony so God this is a
[1:07:25] short testimony so God help
[1:07:27] me I too like you was sitting in a
[1:07:30] church pew as a child God appointed me a
[1:07:33] wonderful mother who served faithfully
[1:07:36] and diligently oh she struggled taking
[1:07:38] us to church I was the youngest of all
[1:07:40] her children and I was the I was honory
[1:07:43] at times I would sing and clap and have
[1:07:46] a grand old time then fall
[1:07:50] asleep right
[1:07:53] Teddy and then fall asleep
[1:07:56] As I Grew and I got older I would begin
[1:07:59] to be torn by the world and the
[1:08:02] church I would be torn by the world
[1:08:05] world and Church Life and he has
[1:08:08] tradition I mean I knew I was different
[1:08:11] I didn't seem to fit in other kids in
[1:08:12] school and in the neighborhood wasn't
[1:08:14] like me or raised like me other kids
[1:08:16] parents didn't teach or lavish This Love
[1:08:18] Of Christ over their life it's how sad
[1:08:21] but my mother did and she enforced this
[1:08:24] message we didn't have a TV in the home
[1:08:27] or allowed to play worldly music I would
[1:08:29] go over to the neighbors to watch their
[1:08:32] TV then at church I didn't feel like I
[1:08:34] fit in all of the other kids had both
[1:08:38] parents as Believers and and seemed that
[1:08:39] they were part of an elite group they
[1:08:42] were around each other and house
[1:08:44] visiting fellowshipping playing with
[1:08:45] each other why I was
[1:08:47] different was it because why was I
[1:08:50] different was it because I had only a
[1:08:51] single parent and I was a little more
[1:08:54] rugged
[1:08:56] there was some there were some kids in
[1:08:58] similar circumstances and we gravitated
[1:09:00] to one another we were like
[1:09:03] outcasts later on later as I approached
[1:09:06] my teens I experienced smoking pot
[1:09:09] remember the testimony from Brother
[1:09:11] Manuel a couple weeks ago it is a
[1:09:14] gateway
[1:09:15] drug it's a gateway to worse things it's
[1:09:18] bad enough but it leads to other things
[1:09:26] in which I had a bad experience talk
[1:09:28] about Scared Straight anytime I tried to
[1:09:30] experience the world it came with a
[1:09:32] wrong with a warning and a spanking too
[1:09:35] in my teens I was in and out of
[1:09:37] rebellious stages I was disobedient like
[1:09:40] you would not believe I was involved
[1:09:42] with neighborhood kids who were in gangs
[1:09:45] I was trying to find a place to belong
[1:09:47] not knowing that I had a place all
[1:09:50] along the warnings and spankings grew As
[1:09:53] I Grew in disobedience
[1:09:58] still going to church still believing
[1:10:00] there is a God who saves and a true
[1:10:02] message that came from a true Prophet it
[1:10:03] was a true it was true just not to me at
[1:10:07] the time it was intellectual Faith see
[1:10:10] as a kid I went by Traditions through
[1:10:13] the through the motions that let me stop
[1:10:17] there that is all too
[1:10:20] common I went through the Traditions
[1:10:23] just going through the motions
[1:10:27] that is so
[1:10:30] much I mean I can't say enough about
[1:10:33] that and you don't know why you do
[1:10:36] it it was a seed but not a not real to
[1:10:41] me yet one day in my teens I felt
[1:10:43] convicted and decided to get baptized I
[1:10:46] was blessed with an older brother who
[1:10:47] took me under his wing I was a real was
[1:10:51] he was a real dear brother he loved me
[1:10:54] as as a brother should and encourag me
[1:10:57] daily even to receive Christ into my
[1:10:59] heart and make the commitment as an
[1:11:01] outward expression and get baptized I
[1:11:03] began to feel on fire yet I was in my
[1:11:07] infancy I was immature things began to
[1:11:10] get harder trials and situations and I
[1:11:12] made bad decisions I would fight with my
[1:11:15] mother ultimately my faith was
[1:11:16] challenged and I shrunk back Brothers
[1:11:20] tried to counsel me but I was not
[1:11:23] hearing them it all started with with
[1:11:25] one small form of Disobedience that led
[1:11:27] to more and
[1:11:29] more I became a rogue teen out of
[1:11:32] control I would later look back and
[1:11:34] wonder how that happened I would also
[1:11:37] ask I would also question if I was saved
[1:11:39] and if God loved me I didn't realize how
[1:11:42] Disobedience works the devil operates a
[1:11:45] very cunning system you would think when
[1:11:47] you get baptized it'll get
[1:11:49] easier there is so much in between that
[1:11:53] I can't discuss and add but just for the
[1:11:56] basics to make this short I would end up
[1:11:59] making a choice the worst Choice
[1:12:02] nonetheless I went into the world I
[1:12:05] would step away from the body and the
[1:12:07] head and the the body and the head to
[1:12:10] reject one is to to reject one is to
[1:12:14] reject the other later on looking at
[1:12:17] scriptures to find out what was taking
[1:12:19] place in my life I found the book of of
[1:12:21] Romans the first chapter and it says
[1:12:24] this furthermore since they did not
[1:12:27] think it worthwhile to retain the
[1:12:29] knowledge of God he gave them over to a
[1:12:32] depraved mind to do what ought not to be
[1:12:36] done I believe the King James says
[1:12:38] reprobate mind if I'm right I'm not
[1:12:40] positive about that but I think in Just
[1:12:42] In My
[1:12:43] Memory I then began to live a life
[1:12:47] full-fledged of
[1:12:50] sin not
[1:12:52] overnight I became more Affiliated in
[1:12:56] gangs then in criminal life
[1:13:00] also cutting Corners to make fast money
[1:13:04] you think the warnings and spanking
[1:13:06] stopped they got more severe God might
[1:13:08] have G might have gave me over but they
[1:13:11] didn't give up on me he would save me
[1:13:13] from my foolish self at 19 years old I
[1:13:16] would find myself in the hospital with a
[1:13:17] gunshot wound in my stomach almost died
[1:13:21] then shortly after facing prison time
[1:13:23] looking at three and a half years prison
[1:13:25] three and a half years in prison in
[1:13:27] prison I would make more bad choices
[1:13:29] that would Place me in supermax lockdown
[1:13:32] now here I am with no Escape God had me
[1:13:35] one-on-one calling to me all the while
[1:13:38] he was calling he was always calling I
[1:13:40] just wasn't
[1:13:43] listening but this was a
[1:13:45] sitdown so I would call out and pray and
[1:13:49] began to pick up my Bible I started to
[1:13:52] come back only not in the way of
[1:13:54] obedience
[1:13:56] we all have a way there's a right
[1:13:58] there's a way that seeth right to a man
[1:14:01] that's a proverb I believe there's a way
[1:14:02] that seeth right to the man but the end
[1:14:04] thereof is
[1:14:07] death in which we are going to respond
[1:14:10] but he has a provided way not our
[1:14:16] way when I get out of prison when I got
[1:14:19] out of prison I would only Venture back
[1:14:21] to the old
[1:14:22] patterns okay so now we passed by when I
[1:14:26] was 14 I was
[1:14:29] baptized 21 I'm in supermax my dad and
[1:14:32] my grandpa is passed and God's dealing
[1:14:34] with me 23 I'm out for 5 years and for
[1:14:38] five years I didn't stand the test and
[1:14:40] have no root I fell
[1:14:43] away only to be sat down again at
[1:14:47] 28 see every 7 years he says so up to
[1:14:51] this point I was starting to get it
[1:14:54] together I was was working a legitimate
[1:14:56] job working hard in a good company ready
[1:14:58] to buy a home and perhaps get married I
[1:15:00] even felt like God was blessing me yet
[1:15:03] in
[1:15:05] Disobedience I was still living
[1:15:07] loose and far from my
[1:15:13] post here 28 years old approaching guess
[1:15:17] what I got into trouble with the law and
[1:15:19] away I go and lost everything so here I
[1:15:22] am on my knees again trying to do things
[1:15:25] my way and not listen to that still
[1:15:28] Small
[1:15:29] Voice to do it to do it the way he
[1:15:34] wanted
[1:15:36] see permissive
[1:15:40] will but I came so close I was so
[1:15:43] sincere too and I cried crocodile tears
[1:15:46] I was starting to do everything right
[1:15:48] while I was in prison only when I got
[1:15:50] out I didn't stand the test in
[1:15:51] Temptation and desires for the things of
[1:15:53] the world drew me in I missed the target
[1:15:56] God demands obedience not
[1:15:59] sacrifice oh God I'll stop doing this
[1:16:02] I'll stop doing that in time I will end
[1:16:05] up learning now out of prison in my 30s
[1:16:10] I turn back to the life of sin almost
[1:16:12] like I graduated in sin and I'm proving
[1:16:16] faithful to serve its desires so with
[1:16:20] risk comes reward now I'm willing to
[1:16:23] risk more for a better life of
[1:16:25] luxury like the third
[1:16:28] illustration from the parable of the S
[1:16:31] because the cares of life and the riches
[1:16:34] and the desires for things to come and
[1:16:36] it chokes it out you remember he's
[1:16:39] talking about that Parable and the The
[1:16:40] Seer sewing seeds and it gets choked out
[1:16:43] by the things of the
[1:16:46] world so for the next five years to a
[1:16:49] total of another seven I went hard into
[1:16:52] this life almost like a man running from
[1:16:54] the Lord I drowned out the calling with
[1:16:57] the things of the world till one day yet
[1:17:00] again for the third time I'm looking at
[1:17:03] going to prison this time it would be
[1:17:05] for a very long
[1:17:07] time but this would be the fourth time
[1:17:10] God would make provisions and shine his
[1:17:13] grace upon me to give me another
[1:17:15] opportunity to heed his
[1:17:19] calling I can tell you all the in
[1:17:23] between situations and look back about
[1:17:25] how God's hand was upon me during those
[1:17:28] foolish times in my life don't be
[1:17:31] mistaken not to bless me but to Save Me
[1:17:35] From Myself sin and
[1:17:37] Satan so the goal is in this I say this
[1:17:43] finally I came to my
[1:17:46] senses then I made the deliberate choice
[1:17:48] I realized things were so severe even
[1:17:50] life-threatening that I knew God meant
[1:17:53] business I was blind see it started in
[1:17:55] Disobedience left me in delusion lies
[1:17:57] and deception it was God who delivered
[1:18:00] me and spared me now sitting in a Cell I
[1:18:04] rededicated my life to the Lord I
[1:18:07] submitted full
[1:18:10] obedience even so much I studied what
[1:18:13] true obedience was as the Holy Spirit
[1:18:16] guided me step by step he began this
[1:18:18] Restoration in me not to water this
[1:18:22] foolish life of sin
[1:18:25] but in moments in those years I sought
[1:18:28] to do
[1:18:30] good I would call to God and pray and
[1:18:33] try to live right or what I thought was
[1:18:38] right in my deceived
[1:18:42] mind but
[1:18:44] nevertheless of however good I thought I
[1:18:46] was I was still in Disobedience until
[1:18:49] one gets back to his or her post and
[1:18:52] position in the body to do what what he
[1:18:55] is asking I was still as good as he I
[1:18:58] was still as good as outside the camp
[1:19:01] all the while still your brother lost in
[1:19:04] the world now I don't consider myself
[1:19:06] worthy to be a brother if any of any of
[1:19:09] the least of you all but God has a
[1:19:11] purpose in all that he
[1:19:13] does he had a purpose in this life that
[1:19:16] he chose to save and
[1:19:19] deliver when before the foundation of
[1:19:21] the world a predestinated seed not only
[1:19:24] to use it as an example but as a
[1:19:28] demonstration what powerful words
[1:19:31] talking about himself not only to use me
[1:19:35] in my life as an example but also a
[1:19:41] demonstration so don't think yourself to
[1:19:44] yourself that if God saved me brother
[1:19:46] Adam I can go and play with fire too
[1:19:49] some leave never to come back they never
[1:19:52] even look back he has spared me
[1:19:55] as a voice on this side of these Prison
[1:19:57] Walls and fences where no man wants to
[1:20:00] be one can even be in prison in his or
[1:20:03] her mind too although I'm not alive and
[1:20:06] not dead just think of that man although
[1:20:09] I am alive and not dead just think of
[1:20:12] that man who went to hell if he could
[1:20:15] have just had one chance to go back and
[1:20:17] tell his family how real hell was but he
[1:20:21] had his chance see and he said send
[1:20:26] someone only to get the response they
[1:20:29] had the
[1:20:33] prophets
[1:20:35] look and I added to this this morning
[1:20:38] I'm going to add to it again they had
[1:20:40] the prophets they had Church they had
[1:20:42] the Bible they had a good mom they had a
[1:20:45] good dad they had all of this that I
[1:20:47] gave them they already had it what do
[1:20:49] you think that somebody else going up
[1:20:51] there and telling them how bad hell is
[1:20:53] Pastor tells them all the time
[1:20:55] they have
[1:20:57] it now if I can look you in the
[1:21:01] face with seriousness and a stern look I
[1:21:05] have to say this I was better off never
[1:21:07] leaving my post in that church pew just
[1:21:09] holding my post right there I was better
[1:21:12] off never knowing the things that the
[1:21:14] world introduced me to you young people
[1:21:16] listen to this I was better off not
[1:21:19] knowing what I know
[1:21:22] now all the while still your brother
[1:21:26] lost but now I'm
[1:21:28] found now I have to fight that much more
[1:21:32] for all things I gave myself over to I
[1:21:34] hope you would see how this works so you
[1:21:37] will know maybe your pastor will explain
[1:21:39] it kind of operation behind the scenes
[1:21:42] unless you know already now I'm cleaned
[1:21:44] up and set aside now to Proclaim to
[1:21:48] those who would heed some calling I once
[1:21:51] had that I once had that
[1:21:55] would have saved me from such misery 21
[1:21:58] years of Disobedience 14 to 35 years
[1:22:05] old I can't help what I
[1:22:08] am I am a member in this
[1:22:11] body there are some for important there
[1:22:14] are some for important roles and some
[1:22:15] for lesser roles listen I'm not saying
[1:22:19] for those flirting with sin or
[1:22:20] temptation to imagine how it plays out
[1:22:23] you might want something so bad even if
[1:22:25] it means to go the way of
[1:22:28] perversion so let me tell you and give
[1:22:31] you a little vision of that the end
[1:22:33] result is sitting right here writing
[1:22:36] this to you don't do
[1:22:40] it there's your answer to it there is a
[1:22:44] right
[1:22:45] way and a right way to go about
[1:22:48] it so right there in those crosswords
[1:22:51] one way is the way of the world and of
[1:22:54] perversion
[1:22:55] or the way of the word and righteousness
[1:22:58] see I didn't realize that a little
[1:23:00] Disobedience result in 21 years of
[1:23:03] Heartache had I been told had I been
[1:23:06] obedient to God's word I would have not
[1:23:09] been in this
[1:23:10] predicament here I am approaching 45
[1:23:13] years old with 25 years more to go here
[1:23:15] in prison this is the repercussions of
[1:23:18] sin but also preparation for God to pour
[1:23:21] out himself into me
[1:23:26] we don't look at the
[1:23:28] chains but the benefit of these chains
[1:23:31] oh God bless
[1:23:33] him what a great
[1:23:38] attitude I'll read it again we don't
[1:23:40] look at the chains but the benefit of
[1:23:42] these chains really there is no more
[1:23:44] chain on a true Son of God we have
[1:23:46] freedom in Christ but we have conditions
[1:23:48] we must live by this his promises on is
[1:23:53] on condition we must believe Faith
[1:23:57] obedience faithfulness pers perseverance
[1:24:00] we see in the Book of James 1:5 and if
[1:24:02] any of you lack wisdom he or she should
[1:24:05] ask of God who gives generously without
[1:24:07] finding
[1:24:10] fault and it would be given to him or
[1:24:13] her but when he or she asks he or she
[1:24:16] must believe and not doubt because he or
[1:24:19] she who who doubts is like a wave of the
[1:24:22] sea blown and tossed in the Wind that
[1:24:25] man or woman should not think he will
[1:24:28] receive anything from the Lord that that
[1:24:31] man or woman is double mind is a
[1:24:33] double-minded man unstable in all that
[1:24:35] he or she does we don't want to be that
[1:24:39] example he was quoting James chapter 1
[1:24:43] as I
[1:24:44] said we don't want to be that example
[1:24:47] that was me too at one time unwise a
[1:24:50] fool blown back and forth and unstable
[1:24:53] in all that I did all the while still
[1:24:55] your
[1:24:56] brother so maybe like myself although
[1:25:00] now stable and wise by his grace given
[1:25:03] to me I may have a reflection of me
[1:25:06] among you when I was young one of you
[1:25:09] who may think you're making some choices
[1:25:12] in life and maybe nobody knows or maybe
[1:25:16] you won't get
[1:25:18] caught but a word from the
[1:25:21] wise your sin will find you out
[1:25:25] I realize as a Son of God I couldn't get
[1:25:28] away with doing wrong why others get
[1:25:32] away and I couldn't I would ask myself
[1:25:36] that's Grace and love of the father
[1:25:38] remember the prodigal son how many left
[1:25:41] and never suffered but that's Grace of
[1:25:44] the father this this brother is saying
[1:25:46] if I would have just held my post though
[1:25:50] if I would have just held
[1:25:51] there I mentioned a parable of the Soul
[1:25:55] as I began to navigate the word and make
[1:25:57] sense of my life and experiences I let
[1:25:59] the word I let the word tell it and who
[1:26:02] I am in Christ for all Christians our
[1:26:05] story is theirs too we should be able to
[1:26:09] see ourselves
[1:26:11] there it's a
[1:26:13] reflection we only hope to reflect him
[1:26:17] though the coin goes both ways I can
[1:26:21] reflect of what is not so when I read
[1:26:25] that Parable it was my life starting at
[1:26:27] 14 years old I had received but I didn't
[1:26:30] understand I was going about it through
[1:26:34] Traditions without going into detail he
[1:26:36] says we can imagine I think every one of
[1:26:39] us knows I was going through it with
[1:26:41] just
[1:26:44] traditions and I didn't understand the
[1:26:47] value I understood one must have the
[1:26:50] spirit it's not much that the enemy snat
[1:26:53] snatching at the word and gives you
[1:26:55] something in exchange so he takes a word
[1:26:57] from you gives you something in exchange
[1:26:59] like something that took pleas like
[1:27:01] something that looks pleas pleasing to
[1:27:02] the eye try to snatch your car keys out
[1:27:04] of a child's hand he'll get to crying
[1:27:07] and hollering but give him or her a
[1:27:09] little
[1:27:10] toy to play with in the meantime take
[1:27:15] your valuable car keys so you can get
[1:27:17] where you need to go that's me at
[1:27:21] 14 immature child unspiritual not fit to
[1:27:26] handle the message of wisdom then at 21
[1:27:29] I came along to my senses only to work
[1:27:31] off emotion it's part of it but I didn't
[1:27:34] have no I didn't have
[1:27:36] root that makes a person want to look up
[1:27:39] agriculture while studying that how does
[1:27:42] Roots grow because I didn't have
[1:27:46] them and then why
[1:27:49] right it lasted for a short time about
[1:27:52] two and a half years some of that in
[1:27:53] supermax I was wondered how I got
[1:27:55] through that time by God's grace is how
[1:27:58] then the word must be tested and I
[1:28:00] failed then at 28 I thought I was really
[1:28:02] doing something till God stopped me in
[1:28:04] my tracks yet again I was trying to be
[1:28:07] popular and trying to be the coolest guy
[1:28:08] like I was a celebrity thinking I was
[1:28:11] belonging and fitting in just concerned
[1:28:13] with the worries of life and
[1:28:15] deceitfulness of wealth I got choked out
[1:28:20] making me unfruitful Mark 20 Mark 4:20
[1:28:23] says this others like seed swn on good
[1:28:25] soil hear the word accept it and produce
[1:28:28] a crop 30 60 or even 100 fold what was
[1:28:32] sown after 35 years brothers and sisters
[1:28:35] I don't want to find out if there's
[1:28:38] still another opportunity the time is
[1:28:41] now to heed and accept this word I was
[1:28:45] all these illustration at one point in
[1:28:47] my life some are stuck there for their
[1:28:49] whole life to never get another
[1:28:51] opportunity I was wondering why didn't
[1:28:53] he just give me over
[1:28:56] completely but I believe who he has made
[1:29:00] me to be a predestinated seed so we must
[1:29:03] believe too not just who he is but what
[1:29:06] he has done then who has he made us to
[1:29:10] be these men as educated in Theology and
[1:29:13] Doctrine and well learned and having
[1:29:15] trouble trying to get that that first
[1:29:17] part right but it's not revealed to
[1:29:21] them they cut them up into threes
[1:29:25] this is not revealed by flesh and blood
[1:29:27] not by Traditions reasoning by work by
[1:29:30] works if we want to know him we must get
[1:29:35] desperate I'm going to stop there for a
[1:29:37] moment brother Paul said something one
[1:29:39] time that stuck with me so well and when
[1:29:42] he gave a testimony brother Paul said
[1:29:44] these words he said we cannot be truly
[1:29:47] saved unless we realize that we are
[1:29:50] truly
[1:29:52] lost that arrogance saying I'm fine I'm
[1:29:56] okay you got to understand that you are
[1:29:59] lost first before you can be saved for
[1:30:02] the Paul that was such wisdom it stuck
[1:30:04] with
[1:30:05] me as we journey with
[1:30:09] him we find out who we are in him for
[1:30:14] our identity is in him not in not in the
[1:30:16] world not in social media not in
[1:30:18] artificial intelligence not in a job but
[1:30:20] in Christ the amen the enemy go goal is
[1:30:24] to kill steal and destroy and Rob I was
[1:30:26] a man qualified for that had it not been
[1:30:29] for God's grace how can I then not
[1:30:32] testify this my life was
[1:30:35] spared and going to be spent here and I
[1:30:38] must cry out unto you brother and sister
[1:30:41] repent of any hint of Disobedience even
[1:30:44] thought let my life not be in vain
[1:30:47] Evermore let not let not the life of
[1:30:50] Christ and others who follow and perish
[1:30:53] not be in vain my Disobedience hurt the
[1:30:55] body I left my PO post to be selfish and
[1:30:58] I was stubborn imagine a part of your
[1:31:01] body stops working it would affect the
[1:31:03] whole body sometimes in the body the
[1:31:06] doctor may have to remove and cut it off
[1:31:08] see I was fortunate that I was healed
[1:31:11] and restored I am still suffering I
[1:31:14] don't have the luxury as you Saints have
[1:31:16] in one sentence the the
[1:31:24] sorry I'm can't I can't read
[1:31:28] that we
[1:31:31] one we
[1:31:34] won I'm Sor I can't read that either but
[1:31:36] I must suffer that if you can be
[1:31:39] forgiven but may still have to suffer
[1:31:42] the repercussions I may never be able to
[1:31:44] join you as my heart desires it hurts me
[1:31:47] so bad but I look to the day when we
[1:31:50] will meet again we are promised that
[1:31:53] meeting in the sky and I'll be the guy
[1:31:55] screaming and hollering finally all the
[1:31:58] saints while all the all the while still
[1:32:01] your brother please young brothers and
[1:32:04] sisters even to the older I need you to
[1:32:08] we need one another the Bible says in
[1:32:10] Ephesians as each one does its work for
[1:32:14] the building itself in love we have the
[1:32:17] message we have the examples we hear the
[1:32:20] preaching to prepare us see to be built
[1:32:23] up and mature so we can attain the whole
[1:32:27] measure of the fullness of
[1:32:29] Christ
[1:32:32] see
[1:32:34] then that we won't be tossed back and
[1:32:36] forth no longer infants unstable
[1:32:40] instead speaking the truth in
[1:32:43] love our life speaks it to one another a
[1:32:47] real love language of obedience we then
[1:32:50] can grow up in him the head who's
[1:32:53] joining us Al together a true Oneness so
[1:32:56] much for a short testimony he says it's
[1:33:00] hard to step to stop this pen from going
[1:33:03] maybe this is for me not for me not to
[1:33:06] share but what am I to do for what
[1:33:09] purpose do I now stand yes we yes we
[1:33:13] believe it but I'm led to report this
[1:33:16] back it's not a glorious life in here
[1:33:18] not complaining but listen my roommate
[1:33:21] is serving life another man who served
[1:33:24] but five who lives but 5et from me is
[1:33:26] serving life and was on death row at one
[1:33:28] time his roommate is doing life and it
[1:33:31] goes with the total of 33 guys living in
[1:33:33] a box one run of four in a
[1:33:36] building here I am one of them and
[1:33:40] entrusted with this word to share it and
[1:33:42] live it I can go on about the food the
[1:33:45] people the situations and so many things
[1:33:47] that's not fit for a Son of God there's
[1:33:49] no 101 guide for how to
[1:33:53] although I have the guide that gives me
[1:33:55] the
[1:33:56] 101 it didn't come easy I have to prove
[1:34:00] faithful in every test killing the
[1:34:02] carnal man not looking to save my life
[1:34:04] but lose it all the while your brother
[1:34:07] and at times felt alone alienated from
[1:34:09] the body this is the place God chose me
[1:34:13] chose to get me oneon-one I could choose
[1:34:16] if I could choose a church pew like you
[1:34:19] or the Altar for him to get a hold of me
[1:34:21] right there how gracious is God to leave
[1:34:24] me but but rais me up and display
[1:34:28] himself through me to these Souls here
[1:34:31] they
[1:34:31] too have an opportunity he's a way maker
[1:34:36] some have rejected some hate me others
[1:34:38] have kicked me out of their religious
[1:34:39] groups bible studies I used to I I use
[1:34:43] those places I I use th I use those
[1:34:46] places I've
[1:34:48] been in the lifestyle and I've once
[1:34:51] talked I've once lived to talk to Thugs
[1:34:53] and killers and lifers and drug dealers
[1:34:56] and the like and while still your
[1:34:58] brother at at times I felt alone and
[1:35:01] alienated and separated from the family
[1:35:03] of God it's been s times of sadness
[1:35:05] distress disappointment times of
[1:35:07] hopelessness then God comes and gives
[1:35:10] reass assurance that I am not alone not
[1:35:13] forsaken not abandoned not alienated or
[1:35:15] separated not just myself but Brothers
[1:35:19] like
[1:35:22] myself and wide we need you and your
[1:35:26] prayers I believe you need Brothers like
[1:35:28] us too maybe for a reminder maybe to
[1:35:31] encourage and help you see the mistakes
[1:35:32] we've made will keep you from doing the
[1:35:35] same maybe you have no desire to reach
[1:35:38] out to the prisoner how about the widow
[1:35:41] or the
[1:35:43] orphan what are we called to maybe you
[1:35:46] have a desire for a prisoner to reach
[1:35:47] out to you how about a deacon or a
[1:35:49] pastor let's reach out to one another
[1:35:51] every ligament supporting one another
[1:35:53] I'm I'm not necessarily saying to write
[1:35:54] me we reach out by doing our part in the
[1:35:57] body child when you're being obedient to
[1:36:00] parents you are doing your parten when
[1:36:02] you say no to these Temptations in a
[1:36:06] rebellious way when you stay away from
[1:36:08] these crowds and away from these sights
[1:36:10] you're doing your part and reaching out
[1:36:13] when we say to one another you're saying
[1:36:16] yes to one another can't walk two ways
[1:36:18] when the devil reaches out to trade you
[1:36:21] for
[1:36:22] something Shining we say no and we take
[1:36:25] the hand of God he takes your hand and
[1:36:28] he takes my hand and joins us together
[1:36:31] the way to remember one as such as I am
[1:36:34] to take these words let them encourage
[1:36:37] you to be the obedience Jesus said if
[1:36:41] you love me you obey me and I obeyed my
[1:36:44] father he was obedient to death for you
[1:36:46] sometimes it kills us to listen to pray
[1:36:49] to go to church go to the AL altar to
[1:36:51] listen to your parents and listen to
[1:36:53] your pastor I have so much more to say
[1:36:56] concerning my life and my life in here
[1:36:59] but I have so much more to say on the
[1:37:01] life that that way laid down before us
[1:37:05] all how wonderful to belong to his body
[1:37:08] to be a son and a daughter of God all
[1:37:10] the while still your brother the whole
[1:37:12] time it was right before my eyes may God
[1:37:16] open these eyes to your heart to know
[1:37:19] you're you're right where you belong if
[1:37:22] you're sitting in that church pew will
[1:37:25] you dedicate yourself to him to obey
[1:37:29] him with all your heart to accept him
[1:37:32] and what he has done for you it'll be
[1:37:35] better than what the world has for you
[1:37:38] trust me friends I wish I never knew or
[1:37:40] have tasted I I would have been better
[1:37:41] off not knowing or experiencing or
[1:37:43] learning once you do something you can't
[1:37:45] undo it but we can repent the musicians
[1:37:48] can come but we can repent everybody I
[1:37:52] have to fight against against those
[1:37:54] things all I
[1:37:56] want now is to know him as Paul says I
[1:38:00] want to know Christ and the power of his
[1:38:02] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:38:04] sharing in his suffering becoming like
[1:38:06] him in his death and so somehow to
[1:38:09] attain the resurrection from the dead
[1:38:13] when a child of God Ventures into the
[1:38:15] world we begin to know the things that a
[1:38:18] child of God is not supposed to know
[1:38:21] Disobedience will lead you will lead and
[1:38:23] pull you that way then your hearts
[1:38:26] become wrong see not the mind of the
[1:38:28] Lord but of the
[1:38:29] world then the thought becomes words
[1:38:33] then actions see the serpent seed there
[1:38:35] is no better way than the way the truth
[1:38:38] and the
[1:38:41] life so what I'm saying to sum it up I
[1:38:44] was like you in a church
[1:38:47] pew in front of all the good
[1:38:49] Spirit-filled pastors and brothers and
[1:38:51] sisters my obedience my my Disobedience
[1:38:54] took me from you and now I'm surrounded
[1:38:56] by men filled with evil spirits all sort
[1:38:59] of perversion and mental illness and
[1:39:01] depraved Minds when I ask how this
[1:39:03] happened to me how did this start a
[1:39:05] small Disobedience a rebellious choice I
[1:39:08] may never get out in fact I may die here
[1:39:12] here I am brothers and sisters your
[1:39:13] example of what not to
[1:39:16] do this is not a feel sorry for me but
[1:39:19] for those living that wrong example to
[1:39:21] be sorry unto repentance if not this if
[1:39:26] not this can be
[1:39:28] you I in all honesty it's impossible
[1:39:32] that I'm sharing this I should be dead I
[1:39:35] should be given over I should be I
[1:39:38] should have been destroyed With God all
[1:39:41] things are possible and he saved and
[1:39:43] delivered me it didn't come cheap but
[1:39:46] with a great price these words are
[1:39:49] sealed with a price and it's my life my
[1:39:52] hope is that you would treasure them and
[1:39:55] bind them to your neck your wonderful
[1:39:57] Pastor gave me such a wonderful
[1:39:59] opportunity just to show you how for
[1:40:02] this message is reaching and the work of
[1:40:04] God is using him for the reach to reach
[1:40:08] the prisoners my mother a widow and
[1:40:11] other orphans pray for him continually
[1:40:14] and
[1:40:15] us God appointed a brother here with me
[1:40:19] as we stand firm in the faith and on
[1:40:22] these front lines contending with the
[1:40:24] spirit forces all around like soldiers
