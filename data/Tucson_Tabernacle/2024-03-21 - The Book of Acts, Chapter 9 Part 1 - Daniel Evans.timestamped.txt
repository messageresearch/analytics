[19:15] Judas comment open the Service in a word
[19:17] of prayer this evening we didn't have
[19:19] any specific needs turned in this
[19:22] evening but I'm sure many of us have a
[19:24] unspoken need that we could lift up a
[19:27] hand and say Lord remember me remember
[19:29] my need
[19:30] [Music]
[19:32] Aaron in prayer
[19:35] battling whatever it is
[19:38] there's many other needs that I'm not
[19:39] thinking of right now but let's just
[19:41] remember each one really occur if you
[19:44] just come just sing that song again as
[19:47] he comes
[19:52] [Music]
[20:05] bring all your needs to foreign
[20:18] [Music]
[20:40] yes
[20:58] let's pray together Lord Jesus we
[21:02] believe that song
[21:05] was played because you wanted us thank
[21:09] you
[21:10] come and talk to you
[21:14] and you've made a great atonement Lord
[21:18] that made it so very possible
[21:21] you have found us without spot without
[21:24] wrinkle
[21:26] because of an atonement that would
[21:29] be ableach to us
[21:32] put us in our rightful positions
[21:35] where we can come to your throne and
[21:37] speak to you
[21:39] and call you Abba Father
[21:40] [Music]
[21:42] it Thrills our heart Lord to to call you
[21:47] of a father
[21:50] you are the pearl of great price to us
[21:54] spoke of diamonds and Silver and Gold
[21:59] but you are to us are the pearl of great
[22:02] price
[22:04] and it puts a worship in our heart
[22:06] towards you and a confidence to come
[22:09] here
[22:11] and to speak to you and to
[22:15] make you feel welcomed because this is
[22:18] truly your church
[22:22] it was you who died
[22:24] and shed blood and it's you that has
[22:28] nail prints in your hands
[22:31] [Music]
[22:32] and with those things in mind we think
[22:35] of you
[22:39] the brother wasn't sure if there was any
[22:41] written requests maybe or but you get to
[22:45] go to the hearts of your sheep and you
[22:48] get to examine that and you know what's
[22:51] down in there
[22:53] we have total confidence that that's
[22:57] what you want to do tonight you want to
[23:00] go and visit your people you want to
[23:03] break bread to them
[23:04] you want to encourage them in the right
[23:07] way you want to discourage them in the
[23:10] wrong
[23:11] and rightfully so God because we gave
[23:15] ourselves to you
[23:17] we are your property
[23:20] we are your family
[23:23] and would you just feel free to come
[23:28] this evening
[23:30] and move on this place
[23:34] I pray that there would be many
[23:37] refillings tonight
[23:39] [Music]
[23:40] I prayed that it would be in our hearts
[23:43] to have as the song said more of you
[23:45] they're not just words to a song
[23:49] there's a song in our heart that's
[23:51] crying that
[23:53] would you do that Lord would you come
[23:56] and
[23:57] cups to overflowing
[23:59] they made that
[24:01] water go into the needy and the sick
[24:05] that's around us and may they be revived
[24:10] it would thrill our hearts to live for
[24:12] someone else of that matter
[24:15] we want to give you all the glory
[24:16] tonight
[24:18] we want to give you all the honor we
[24:19] want to offer you preeminence Lord to
[24:23] come
[24:24] speak
[24:26] heal us Lord with thy great word
[24:29] we want to say that we love you
[24:32] we worship you
[24:34] and there just aren't enough words to
[24:37] say how we feel but you are the pearl of
[24:40] great price to us we give you all the
[24:43] glory and we give you all the honor in

[42:00] let's turn in our Bibles
[42:01] [Music]
[42:03] let's turn to First Timothy chapter one
[42:06] it's a scripture I believe to lay a good
[42:08] foundation
[42:10] for this Acts chapter 9.
[42:13] First Timothy chapter 1 verse 12.
[42:21] and I thank Christ Jesus our lord
[42:26] who hath enabled me
[42:28] for that he counted me faithful putting
[42:31] me into the ministry
[42:33] who was before a blasphemer a persecutor
[42:36] and injurious
[42:38] but I obtained Mercy because I did it
[42:40] ignorantly in unbelief
[42:43] and the grace of our Lord was exceeding
[42:46] abundant with faith and love which is in
[42:49] Christ Jesus amen let's bow our heads
[42:53] Lord Jesus those words of your servant
[42:57] the Apostle Paul
[42:59] father is we see his ministry begin
[43:03] tonight in this book of Acts father we
[43:05] pray that you would lay your blessings
[43:07] upon the word as I read it and Lord may
[43:10] we have the understanding to benefit
[43:13] from it and father to to appreciate it
[43:16] we love you Lord we ask that you join us
[43:18] in Jesus name amen
[43:21] God bless you all you can take your
[43:22] seats
[43:28] sister Eunice pointed out that I'm
[43:31] hoarse
[43:33] it's because yesterday's Services
[43:37] um
[43:38] last night they were uh there was
[43:41] there's a lot of uh the the volume was
[43:44] raised especially when I was speaking so
[43:47] that's that's why the vocal cards aren't
[43:50] in as such as good a shape as they
[43:52] usually are
[43:54] um it's good to see everyone
[43:55] it's it's good to see you know I was
[43:57] thinking about our young people have for
[43:59] the past couple days and and I'm just so
[44:01] proud of them sister Olivia a little
[44:04] sister I'm proud of you you know when
[44:06] you come into church and you're here
[44:09] and um you're just good kids it was so
[44:13] I'm so honored to see the the Roberts
[44:16] family there in church last night and
[44:20] wow they just looked they were just like
[44:23] glowed you know walking in there and I
[44:26] may be a little bit biased but wow am I
[44:28] proud I just I feel good about our our
[44:31] kids they um they're first class
[44:35] and I'm honored that that they would
[44:37] want to come to church and I want to
[44:38] make church somewhere that they enjoy
[44:41] coming that's why we have some of the
[44:43] projects we're working on
[44:45] I want I want this to be a place that
[44:47] they like to come to
[44:50] um
[44:50] and I
[44:52] I don't see Kenneth back there I grew up
[44:54] I woke up grumpy this morning too
[44:58] I didn't I didn't get enough sleep so
[45:01] God bless the little guy I could for the
[45:04] Jordan I relate to him and you know what
[45:06] Hosanna I think is my favorite song
[45:08] so so yeah I relate to the little guy
[45:13] um this saw
[45:15] or this uh
[45:16] Acts chapter 9 is that as I said this
[45:20] morning it's a pivotal pivotal place
[45:23] in this book of Acts and and really in
[45:26] all Christian history
[45:28] in Acts chapter 8 that we just went
[45:32] through but the Lyle preached on
[45:34] we see that Saul was consenting to the
[45:37] death of Stephen
[45:39] and
[45:41] we see another deacon
[45:43] besides Stephen who was stoned he was
[45:46] murdered we have another Deacon rise on
[45:50] the scene this man's name's Philip
[45:52] we heard where Philip came from and and
[45:55] we see Philip had Evangelistic meetings
[45:57] in these different places and then we
[45:59] see this man Simon the Sorcerer he comes
[46:02] in and and he starts he he looks and he
[46:06] likes this and he became he becomes a
[46:07] Believer and then he sees that these
[46:11] disciples are laying their hands
[46:14] on the people and then these people are
[46:16] receiving the Holy Ghost
[46:18] so Simon says he said Simon Says
[46:22] I wonder if that were that where that
[46:24] comes from
[46:27] Simon the Sorcerer says he says that he
[46:32] wants to be able to he wants to not
[46:35] receive necessarily the Holy Spirit but
[46:37] he wants that power that where he can
[46:40] lay hands on other people and they can
[46:42] receive the Holy Spirit and he offers to
[46:44] pay the disciples and we see that Peter
[46:47] rebukes him and then all of a sudden we
[46:50] see Philip back out and he's out in the
[46:52] desert
[46:53] and he's he's going along the Lord leads
[46:56] him to this man of great stature this
[46:59] important
[47:00] Ethiopian man and Philip jumps on his
[47:05] his Carriage there
[47:07] and he introduces him to the Lord Jesus
[47:10] and to me it's so interesting that he
[47:12] introduces him to the Lord Jesus by the
[47:15] word
[47:17] he was reading the word and you see this
[47:20] man and he saw the revelation of it and
[47:23] then he gave his heart to the Lord I'm
[47:25] going to talk today that there's
[47:27] different ways that people give their
[47:30] hearts to the Lord Jesus
[47:32] so we see this Ethiopian he gives his
[47:35] heart to the Lord through the
[47:36] interpretation of the scripture and then
[47:38] as brother Lyle pointed out they're out
[47:41] in the middle of the desert and all of a
[47:44] sudden they find water
[47:46] I'd like to know about a while where it
[47:48] was it was in an oasis was it some sort
[47:51] of a man-made pool what was it but that
[47:53] Ethiopian eunuch he says Hey and He
[47:57] commands The Chariot to stop commands it
[48:01] stop and he says here's water what
[48:04] prevents me from being baptized and
[48:07] Philip says if you believe with all your
[48:09] heart and he says I believe that Jesus
[48:10] Christ is the son of God
[48:12] and then Philip baptizes him there
[48:16] so let's start with a scripture here
[48:18] before we get to Acts chapter 9 let's
[48:21] start with another scripture and that's
[48:24] Philippians chapter 3 and it just kind
[48:27] of it sets a mood really for for who
[48:31] this man is that that was struck down
[48:35] that we're going to read about here in a
[48:36] minute that how much this man
[48:40] appreciates the Lord Jesus further on in
[48:43] his ministry Philippians chapter 3 let's
[48:46] start with verse 3.
[48:48] this is
[48:50] who is now known when this is written as
[48:53] the Apostle Paul
[48:55] and he says this
[48:57] for we are the circumcision which
[49:00] worship God and in the spirit and
[49:03] rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no
[49:05] confidence in the flesh
[49:07] though I might also have confidence in
[49:09] the flesh if any other man thinketh that
[49:11] he hath whereof he might Trust In the
[49:14] Flesh I'm more
[49:16] circumcise The Eighth Day of the stock
[49:18] of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a
[49:21] Hebrew of Hebrews as touching the law of
[49:24] Pharisee
[49:25] concerning Zeal persecuting the church
[49:29] touching the righteous which is in the
[49:32] law blameless
[49:34] but what things were gained to me those
[49:38] I counted loss for Christ wow
[49:42] yea doubtless and I count all things but
[49:45] lost for the Excellency of the knowledge
[49:48] of Christ Jesus my Lord it's important
[49:51] that word right there my Lord we're
[49:53] going to hear something about that in in
[49:55] the scriptures coming for whom I have
[49:57] suffered the loss of all things and do
[49:59] count them but done
[50:01] that I may win Christ
[50:04] and be found in him not having mine own
[50:06] righteousness which is of the law but
[50:10] that which is through the Faith of
[50:12] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[50:14] by faith that I may know him
[50:17] and in the power of his resurrection and
[50:20] in The Fellowship of his sufferings be
[50:22] made conformable unto his death
[50:26] those are very very important things and
[50:29] the power of his resurrection and the
[50:31] fellowship of his sufferings
[50:33] really says that this man is the Christ
[50:36] if by any means I might attain unto the
[50:39] resurrection of the Dead
[50:41] not as though I had already attained
[50:45] either we're already perfect but I
[50:48] follow after that if that I may
[50:51] apprehend that for which also I am
[50:54] apprehended of Christ Jesus so he's
[50:57] saying here that I want to get a hold
[51:02] of the same Jesus
[51:04] that got a hold of me
[51:08] now this is
[51:10] 8064 according to your Bible said if you
[51:13] have a Scofield bible probably everybody
[51:15] knows this but if you have a Scofield
[51:17] bible in the in the sinner between the
[51:20] between the two readings here in the
[51:24] center and at the top it tells you the
[51:25] date the estimated date of when these
[51:28] things took place
[51:30] so according to to these dates
[51:34] Paul was struck down on the road to
[51:35] Damascus in 80 35 and he wrote this in
[51:38] Philippians in 1864.
[51:41] so this is
[51:43] some 30 years later and he's still had
[51:48] that that Zeal not as though I had
[51:51] already attained it
[51:52] either were made already perfect but I
[51:55] follow after that I may apprehend that I
[51:58] may get a hold
[52:01] of that for which I am apprehended of
[52:04] Christ that that which got a hold of me
[52:07] and I'm still searching for it brother
[52:09] Kurt 30 years later there is this great
[52:12] man the Apostle Paul and he's still
[52:16] searching for it he still has a desire
[52:20] there's this still this burning desire
[52:22] to have it you know when we receive the
[52:25] holy spirit that doesn't mean it's like
[52:27] okay I got it I'm done no that fire
[52:30] starts burning and then it just burns
[52:33] more and more and more you just want
[52:35] more of the Holy Ghost and more of it
[52:38] brethren
[52:40] I count not myself to have apprehended
[52:44] but this one thing I do
[52:46] forgetting those things which are behind
[52:49] and reaching forth unto those things
[52:52] which are before
[52:53] I press toward the prize to I press
[52:57] towards the mark for the prize of the
[52:59] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[53:04] what
[53:05] beautiful words and you can tell those
[53:08] words just come from his heart
[53:10] he just loves it and he says he says you
[53:13] know he says I used to be this
[53:16] and even here 30 years later he still
[53:18] mentions it I used to be this but I am
[53:20] still pressing towards that Mark for the
[53:24] prize of the High Calling of God
[53:27] and we see this man Saul
[53:30] as I said in in chapter 8 he started
[53:33] making Havoc of the church
[53:37] he started just going after them and and
[53:39] there was this just this hatred that he
[53:43] had for these people that didn't believe
[53:45] like him
[53:46] and he saw that this cult maybe was
[53:49] spreading and he's on his way to
[53:51] Damascus which is north of Jerusalem we
[53:54] see that that all of this what he would
[53:57] call a mess all of this stuff started in
[54:00] Jerusalem maybe in this Upper Room
[54:03] and then it went out and all of a sudden
[54:05] there's thousands of people who are
[54:08] following this this ministry of this man
[54:11] who's dead now and they're saying that
[54:14] he rose again
[54:15] and now it's starting to spread outside
[54:18] the city of Jerusalem and he sees that
[54:21] this place in Damascus this is a place a
[54:24] high population center for the Jews and
[54:28] so he goes
[54:30] and and he wants to kind of quarantine
[54:34] this place Jerusalem kind of like covid
[54:38] you know they had the coveted shutdowns
[54:40] and they shut down all the flights and
[54:42] all that here's what Paul is doing he
[54:44] wants to just just isolate it to them
[54:46] then we can kill them all in here put
[54:48] them in jail rather than having this
[54:50] squirt out and and then we have to chase
[54:52] them down all over the place so so Paul
[54:55] is he's looking how can we stop this
[54:59] and
[55:01] the problem in Saul's mind
[55:04] was you have this bunch of people
[55:09] who are following this man
[55:12] that was
[55:14] indicted convicted sentenced
[55:19] and executed
[55:22] put in the grave
[55:24] and now they're saying that this man
[55:26] raised from the dead how can this be
[55:29] true
[55:30] now it's it's proven Paul would say no
[55:33] no this is proven that this man didn't
[55:35] raise from the dead
[55:37] this was you know I've got the evidence
[55:40] here we've got witnesses that he didn't
[55:42] in fact you know this man Jesus was
[55:45] propagating this this prophecy before he
[55:49] died
[55:51] and that's maybe where where all and
[55:53] then it was he said it enough times
[55:55] Jesus said it enough time so people
[55:56] could jot it down
[55:58] so this was going around that Jesus had
[56:02] prophesied of his death I'll redo
[56:03] Matthew 16 21 quickly it says this from
[56:07] the time from that time forth
[56:09] began Jesus to show unto his disciples
[56:12] how that he must go into Jerusalem and
[56:14] suffer many things of the elders and the
[56:16] chief priests and the scribes and be
[56:19] killed and be raised again the third day
[56:23] now there's many scriptures of this
[56:26] prophecy being given openly so so many
[56:30] could hear it not the least of these is
[56:32] Matthew chapter 12 verse 40. it says
[56:34] Jesus talk and says this for as Jonas
[56:37] was three days and three nights in the
[56:40] whale's belly so the son of man be three
[56:43] days and three nights in the heart of
[56:45] the Earth
[56:46] so Jesus had prophesied that this was
[56:48] going to happen so so you have to look
[56:51] at it from Saul's perspective he's like
[56:53] okay he prophesied it now these
[56:56] disciples they're going to go and
[56:57] they're going to make it happen
[56:59] right so in Matthew 28
[57:02] verse 12. I think we should read this
[57:05] one
[57:07] this is after Jesus died after he rose
[57:10] from the dead Matthew 28 verse 12 and
[57:14] when they were assembled with the elders
[57:17] and had taken counsel they gave large
[57:19] money unto the soldiers saying say ye
[57:23] his disciples came by night and stole
[57:25] him away while we slept
[57:29] and if this come to the governor's ears
[57:31] we will persuade him and secure you so
[57:34] they took the money and did as they were
[57:36] taught and this saying is commonly
[57:39] reported among the Jews until this day
[57:43] wow this is a rumor
[57:46] and look how this rumor stuck and this
[57:49] must have surely was in Saul's mind or
[57:52] else he wouldn't have been able to
[57:54] justify what he's doing
[57:56] and how
[57:58] this a rumor like that
[58:01] and like the Bible says here it's it's
[58:03] probably reported under this day maybe
[58:05] 2000 years later how a rumor or a lie
[58:10] can stick with someone their whole life
[58:14] it can be said and it can be an
[58:16] exaggeration and then that said about
[58:18] that person and then people want to
[58:21] believe often want to believe that lie
[58:23] and then it's told from here to here to
[58:25] here and that person has that stigma for
[58:29] their whole lives even if it never
[58:31] happened
[58:33] it's a perfect example right here in the
[58:35] scriptures do you remember
[58:37] um it's in the Deep College to the deep
[58:40] that video when the the uh the people
[58:44] are coming in the prayer line and there
[58:46] was this nervous woman that came up
[58:47] there and brother Branham said something
[58:49] like there's a dark shadow over you
[58:53] and and he says I see he says it's a lie
[58:56] he said someone has told a lie about you
[58:59] they called you a witch and it was
[59:01] making it was just ruining her health
[59:03] and and she and she had a heart problem
[59:05] because of it and brother Brown said
[59:07] don't worry about that he says he said
[59:09] you know that's that's that's what's
[59:10] causing your heart problems go
[59:12] and and be healed or and recover
[59:15] whatever it was
[59:17] that lady had a lie was told about her
[59:21] and how those things they just stay with
[59:24] us and their rumors and you hear them
[59:27] today you hear them about brother
[59:28] Brianna many of us
[59:30] people have told rumors about us and and
[59:33] it's like you know what somebody told
[59:34] someone told that about me 30 years ago
[59:36] and it's not it's just not true but then
[59:39] it'll creep up it'll pop up and it'll go
[59:42] down and then and then it'll come but
[59:44] we should be so so careful
[59:48] so this trip
[59:50] as Saul he's heard these stories and
[59:55] this trip to Damascus is it's a long way
[59:57] it's not just over to Bethlehem it's a
[1:00:01] ways up there I don't know brother why
[1:00:03] what is a few days probably back then I
[1:00:05] would say something like that so so
[1:00:08] Saul's going
[1:00:10] and this hatred is just building in him
[1:00:14] and you know how you you stew about
[1:00:16] stuff
[1:00:17] you know you might somebody you might
[1:00:19] think that somebody did you wrong or you
[1:00:21] might think about about somebody that
[1:00:23] that maybe lied or did or stole
[1:00:26] something or took money and and it just
[1:00:29] it builds within you and you don't talk
[1:00:31] to that person you know how it is we've
[1:00:33] all done it right yeah we've all done it
[1:00:36] and and you think well I'm gonna I'm
[1:00:38] gonna tell him this or I'm gonna tell
[1:00:39] her that and and you get this whole
[1:00:41] scenario in your mind if if she says
[1:00:44] this I'm going to say that and and this
[1:00:46] and this and this and this well how come
[1:00:47] it never works out that way
[1:00:50] it never works out the way that we have
[1:00:52] it in our minds how how this scenario
[1:00:56] and that's what happened with this man
[1:00:58] Saul thank God so he is he's going and
[1:01:02] it's building and it's building
[1:01:04] and he's he gets almost he gets almost
[1:01:08] to this place Damascus and he's gonna
[1:01:10] stop by and he's going to get these
[1:01:12] papers
[1:01:13] from
[1:01:15] the Sanhedrin I assuming is
[1:01:19] and I'm going to take them out
[1:01:22] he needs permission to do it acts
[1:01:24] chapter 9 verse 1.
[1:01:28] by the way don't worry I'm not even
[1:01:30] going to get close to finished
[1:01:33] so we'll we'll stop when we stop
[1:01:37] and Saul yet breathing out threatenings
[1:01:39] and Slaughter against the Disciples of
[1:01:41] the Lord went under the high priest now
[1:01:44] notice Saul's a leader here he's a young
[1:01:46] man but he's a leader and he had access
[1:01:48] to the high priest and he had he had the
[1:01:50] confidence of the high priest
[1:01:52] and the call and the high priest had
[1:01:53] enough confidence in him to write these
[1:01:56] letters
[1:01:57] this permission
[1:01:59] and desired of him letters to Damascus
[1:02:01] to the synagogues that if he found any
[1:02:04] of this any of this way
[1:02:07] whether they were men or women he might
[1:02:11] bring them bound unto Jerusalem who was
[1:02:14] it was you sister Debbie who was talking
[1:02:16] about the way was it sister Amelia yeah
[1:02:18] so so sister Emily is out there and
[1:02:20] overheard her talking about this the way
[1:02:25] and that they they weren't called
[1:02:27] Christians yet that word has not been
[1:02:29] invented
[1:02:30] so this is this is the way I'm not
[1:02:34] quoting the Mandalorian if anybody
[1:02:36] probably don't
[1:02:38] but brother Joe
[1:02:40] you laughed
[1:02:42] but but anyways this that's what they
[1:02:45] call them of this way
[1:02:46] and
[1:02:48] so uh he's going
[1:02:51] and as he journeyed he came near
[1:02:53] Damascus
[1:02:55] and suddenly
[1:02:57] they're shined let me go back to that
[1:03:00] one I want to make sure I read every
[1:03:01] word that if you found any in this way
[1:03:03] whether they were men or women he might
[1:03:06] bring them bound to Jerusalem
[1:03:08] and as he journeyed he came near
[1:03:10] Damascus and suddenly they're shined
[1:03:13] round about him a light from heaven
[1:03:17] now later on when Paul was telling this
[1:03:21] story
[1:03:22] to this King Agrippa he's the grandson
[1:03:26] of King Herod
[1:03:28] um
[1:03:29] he tells it that
[1:03:32] this happened in the middle of the day
[1:03:35] and he said that this light later on as
[1:03:38] I said this this light was brighter than
[1:03:41] the sun that struck him down
[1:03:44] and notice it says there it says and
[1:03:46] suddenly
[1:03:47] so this happened this was a surprise
[1:03:50] he's just going along and he's getting
[1:03:53] fired up in Damascus maybe is out in the
[1:03:55] distance and he's going and all of a
[1:03:57] sudden Wham everything changes
[1:04:01] you know we talk about testimonies a lot
[1:04:04] and we love to hear each other's
[1:04:06] testimony and we love to give our own
[1:04:08] testimonies
[1:04:10] some people give their hearts
[1:04:12] you know there's just something inside
[1:04:14] of them pulling
[1:04:16] and then um
[1:04:18] telling them to go to church and then
[1:04:19] and then when there's an altar call we
[1:04:22] find them at the altar and and they may
[1:04:24] be weeping and and then something
[1:04:26] changes in their life we saw that
[1:04:30] last night
[1:04:31] where there's many that came to the
[1:04:33] Altar and I've still been getting
[1:04:34] testimonies about how that that
[1:04:38] that changed them coming to the Altar
[1:04:41] and then there's then there's other
[1:04:43] times that we've seen that that people
[1:04:45] can they might get a disease they might
[1:04:49] get heart disease they might get cancer
[1:04:51] or something like that and then all of a
[1:04:53] sudden they get serious about the Lord
[1:04:57] there was a
[1:05:00] there was when I was in Jeffersonville I
[1:05:02] got a phone call somebody had been
[1:05:04] watching YouTube
[1:05:05] and he was just searching religion or
[1:05:09] something and he came to brother
[1:05:11] branham's sermon on the token
[1:05:14] and he started listening to that and wow
[1:05:18] I like what this guy is saying
[1:05:22] so he got through and then he so he
[1:05:25] Googled it and he found our phone number
[1:05:27] he called and and uh it got sent to me
[1:05:30] he said I want to talk to somebody about
[1:05:32] the ministry he says he says I just want
[1:05:34] to give my heart to the Lord the phone
[1:05:36] called came to me I picked up the phone
[1:05:38] there was no hello from him that wasn't
[1:05:41] anything I said hello this is Daniel
[1:05:43] Evans he said I need the token
[1:05:48] what a way to start a conversation
[1:05:52] so
[1:05:53] started talking with them
[1:05:55] and the brother was just sincere man he
[1:06:00] was first class and and I caught he was
[1:06:03] living in Pennsylvania I called up a
[1:06:05] pastor a friend of mine there and the
[1:06:07] brother baptized him in the name of the
[1:06:10] Lord
[1:06:11] and you know when people
[1:06:14] first come to the Lord there's this
[1:06:16] sweet innocence that you see especially
[1:06:20] someone that that hasn't been around
[1:06:23] and I noticed in this brother and there
[1:06:26] was another brother
[1:06:28] that the same thing happened a similar
[1:06:31] phone call a similar thing someone I
[1:06:34] think gave him a track and he called and
[1:06:38] um
[1:06:39] he just fell in love
[1:06:41] with the Lord Jesus
[1:06:44] and both of these brothers the one
[1:06:48] brother's name is Adam the other one is
[1:06:49] Craig
[1:06:51] um Craig lived in Alaska and Adam as I
[1:06:54] said lived in Pennsylvania but they saw
[1:06:58] they would see how the Bible teaches
[1:07:02] and then they they really enjoyed
[1:07:05] brother branham's message they saw
[1:07:06] brother Brandon's message taught and
[1:07:09] then they would ask brother
[1:07:12] you know brother Branham
[1:07:15] taught against denominations
[1:07:19] and he said boy every time I listen to
[1:07:21] him he's against denominations he said
[1:07:24] man it seems like there's a lot of
[1:07:27] denominations out there and people that
[1:07:28] believe brother Brianna
[1:07:30] I was like huh really and both both
[1:07:34] these brothers
[1:07:35] said that and they they look they have
[1:07:37] this innocent way of looking and they
[1:07:40] say well the segregation this this group
[1:07:42] believes this and this group believes
[1:07:44] this and he said brother they're in the
[1:07:45] same town and I can drive across town in
[1:07:49] like seven minutes
[1:07:51] how come they're not in the same church
[1:07:53] that's like brother
[1:07:55] hey uh
[1:07:57] when you figure that out you tell me
[1:08:03] um
[1:08:06] then uh
[1:08:07] another another one that called one time
[1:08:10] so so they just
[1:08:11] it was witnessed to them so another one
[1:08:14] that called one time it was someone that
[1:08:16] saw a billboard
[1:08:18] and it had our website on there they
[1:08:20] went to the website it was a it was a
[1:08:22] girl young lady and she called I believe
[1:08:26] she was in Mobile Alabama I'm not
[1:08:29] positive about that but it was an Air
[1:08:30] Force Base there and she was in the Air
[1:08:32] Force
[1:08:33] and
[1:08:34] she called up and she said yeah she says
[1:08:37] I I started studying your website and
[1:08:40] she said
[1:08:41] um this teaching on the godhead she said
[1:08:44] I have a group of Christian friends she
[1:08:47] said would you teach our Bible study on
[1:08:49] the phone
[1:08:50] I said yeah I'd love to do that so they
[1:08:54] would call in and there was this group
[1:08:55] this group of soldiers these Air Force
[1:08:59] people and we'd have a Bible studies we
[1:09:02] talked we talked about whatever subject
[1:09:04] they wanted to and we talked about the
[1:09:06] godhead and and how that when you have
[1:09:10] the Trinity there's there's a problem
[1:09:13] because when you're praying who are you
[1:09:15] praying to
[1:09:17] the father or the son are the two most
[1:09:21] common you don't see people really
[1:09:23] praying to the Holy Spirit but how does
[1:09:25] that work
[1:09:27] when you have
[1:09:28] a monotheistic God
[1:09:32] but it sounds like you have two here so
[1:09:33] so we went through that and it was
[1:09:35] really successful then we went into the
[1:09:37] serpent seed and that's what really got
[1:09:40] them so there's a couple of that little
[1:09:42] bible study tonight one I believe
[1:09:44] um I think she's at brother Yancey's
[1:09:46] church and the other one
[1:09:48] um I don't know where he is but just a
[1:09:51] group of people just just gave their
[1:09:53] hearts to the Lord just so open and so
[1:09:55] so willing to hear and willing to
[1:09:58] understand these things and that's the
[1:10:00] same thing that happened to this
[1:10:01] Ethiopian that was out in in the desert
[1:10:05] he was reading this he's like man I just
[1:10:07] don't understand this
[1:10:10] and then this man of God came and said
[1:10:13] well why don't you understand it
[1:10:15] explained it and then the brother gave
[1:10:18] his heart to the Lord
[1:10:21] verse number four
[1:10:24] now he had just seen this light
[1:10:27] and he fell to the Earth and heard a
[1:10:30] voice saying unto him Saul Saul why
[1:10:31] persecutest thou me
[1:10:34] and he said who art thou Lord
[1:10:37] and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou
[1:10:39] persecuteth it is hard for thee to kick
[1:10:41] against the pricks
[1:10:44] this is a this is a big time scripture
[1:10:47] right here they're all big time but this
[1:10:49] one
[1:10:50] there's just so much into it
[1:10:55] there was something about this Pharisee
[1:10:58] that knew this was God speaking to him
[1:11:01] this miracle he had fell on the ground
[1:11:05] and he was a he was afraid he was blind
[1:11:09] he started shaking and he says who are
[1:11:13] you Lord he knew that this one speaking
[1:11:17] to him was a supernatural being it
[1:11:22] wasn't just
[1:11:24] falling down and hitting your head it
[1:11:26] was something big and when he said I am
[1:11:29] Jesus whom you are persecuting you can
[1:11:33] imagine the fear
[1:11:35] that came on this man this is the one
[1:11:37] that I wanted to destroy this is the one
[1:11:39] that I didn't think was real
[1:11:41] and now he's speaking to me and he's
[1:11:44] speaking to me out of this light
[1:11:47] we just look at the significance of this
[1:11:49] moment and a few scriptures later we're
[1:11:52] gonna we're gonna see that it was in
[1:11:54] fact Christ that was speaking right
[1:11:56] there I think we already know that
[1:11:58] anyways let me read this quote to you
[1:11:59] from Brother Branham he says this
[1:12:01] the presence of God unrecognized he says
[1:12:04] when the light the pillar of Fire
[1:12:07] smote Paul down on the road to Damascus
[1:12:10] he recognized that he was in the
[1:12:12] presence of God
[1:12:14] now that Hebrew would have never called
[1:12:16] any other Spirit Lord
[1:12:18] besides he know that he was the that was
[1:12:22] the same Pillar of Fire that led his
[1:12:24] people out of the wilderness
[1:12:25] he said Lord who are you Saul Saul why
[1:12:28] persecuted thou me he said I am Jesus
[1:12:31] Jesus said I come from God and I return
[1:12:33] to God he was that fire that was in the
[1:12:36] burning bush that led Moses through the
[1:12:39] Wilderness and he returned back to that
[1:12:42] and now here he was on the road down to
[1:12:46] Damascus was stricken down
[1:12:50] I want to read another scripture that
[1:12:52] you've maybe never considered that's
[1:12:54] first Timothy chapter 6 verse 13.
[1:12:58] listen to this same Apostle speaking he
[1:13:01] says this I give thee charge in the
[1:13:03] sight of God
[1:13:04] who quickeneth all things and before
[1:13:07] Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate
[1:13:09] witnessed a good confession that thou
[1:13:12] keepeth this commandment without spot
[1:13:14] unrebukable until the appearing of our
[1:13:17] Lord Jesus Christ which in his time he
[1:13:21] shall show who is the blessed and only
[1:13:24] potentate the King of Kings and the Lord
[1:13:26] of lords now listen to this
[1:13:30] who only hath immortality
[1:13:32] so there's no way for the job we can
[1:13:35] live forever live eternally if it's not
[1:13:37] for this man Jesus Christ
[1:13:40] dwelling in the light
[1:13:43] which no man can approach unto
[1:13:46] whom no man hath seen nor can see to
[1:13:50] whom the honor and power Everlasting
[1:13:53] amen this
[1:13:56] unapproachable light as Paul said is
[1:14:01] where this Christ dwells
[1:14:04] for time's sake
[1:14:06] I'm going to
[1:14:08] now let's do it we got time First
[1:14:11] Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1.
[1:14:14] moreover brother and I declare unto you
[1:14:16] the gospel which I preached unto you
[1:14:18] which also ye have received and wherein
[1:14:21] ye stand
[1:14:22] by which also you are saved if you keep
[1:14:24] in memory what I preached unto you
[1:14:27] unless you have believed in vain for I
[1:14:30] delivered unto you first of all that
[1:14:32] which I received how that Christ died
[1:14:35] for our sins according to the scriptures
[1:14:36] and that he was buried and that he rose
[1:14:39] again the third day according to the
[1:14:41] scriptures this is the same man that was
[1:14:43] going to Damascus to kill everybody
[1:14:44] because they believed this
[1:14:48] and that he was seen of cephas then of
[1:14:50] the twelve and after that he was seen
[1:14:53] above 500 Brethren at once of whom the
[1:14:56] greater part remain unto this present
[1:14:58] but some are fallen asleep
[1:15:01] after that he was seen of James then of
[1:15:04] all the apostles we're talking about the
[1:15:06] resurrection of the Lord Jesus here
[1:15:08] and I like this and here's Paul
[1:15:10] and last of all
[1:15:12] he was seen of me also
[1:15:15] as one born out of due time so Paul is
[1:15:19] saying that my experience on that road
[1:15:21] to Damascus where this light came in and
[1:15:24] spoke to me it is the same as you all
[1:15:27] when you walked with him and talked with
[1:15:29] him and saw him the resurrected Christ I
[1:15:32] have the same experience because I met
[1:15:34] him on this road
[1:15:36] and he trembling back to acts six I mean
[1:15:39] back to Acts 9. verse 6.
[1:15:43] and he trembling and astonished said
[1:15:46] Lord what will thou have me to do
[1:15:50] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[1:15:52] into the City and it shall be told thee
[1:15:54] what thou must do
[1:15:56] now here right here in this scripture
[1:15:59] here is the evidence of Paul's
[1:16:01] conversion
[1:16:02] you know you hear about people giving
[1:16:04] their hearts to the Lord and Paul says
[1:16:06] Lord right here he's converted sister
[1:16:09] Shirley he's it's the old Paul's done he
[1:16:12] says I believe him now and he is
[1:16:14] addressing him as Lord
[1:16:17] he says Lord
[1:16:20] now look at it now look at a converted
[1:16:22] sinner
[1:16:23] what will you have me to do
[1:16:26] we see Paul under his own confession
[1:16:29] he's convert converted there and now as
[1:16:32] we when we give our hearts to the lord
[1:16:36] it's not Lord what can you do for me
[1:16:40] when we come to the altar or we may be
[1:16:42] praying or we may we may be on the road
[1:16:44] to Damascus and struck down but now it's
[1:16:47] it's Lord
[1:16:49] what would you have me do
[1:16:52] I'll stop doing this I'll stop doing
[1:16:55] that I'll start doing this I'll start
[1:16:57] doing whatever you want me to do
[1:16:59] the conversion
[1:17:01] of a sinner
[1:17:03] and the men which journeyed with him
[1:17:05] stood speechless
[1:17:06] hearing a voice but seeing no man
[1:17:10] okay
[1:17:12] since it's a Bible study we've got to
[1:17:15] stop right here for a minute this is an
[1:17:17] important one
[1:17:18] yeah this is what
[1:17:21] probably most
[1:17:24] Scholars say here is an absolute
[1:17:27] contradiction in the Bible
[1:17:30] I'm going to tell you why they say that
[1:17:32] let me read it again and the men which
[1:17:34] journeyed with him stood speechless
[1:17:36] hearing a voice but seeing no man
[1:17:39] brother if you could put an acts 22 9
[1:17:41] for me
[1:17:45] brother Branham answered this question
[1:17:47] on questions and answers somebody asked
[1:17:49] him this question
[1:17:52] now look at that look at right here now
[1:17:55] let me read Acts
[1:17:57] 9 7 again
[1:17:59] you look up there
[1:18:01] and when the man journeyed with me stood
[1:18:04] speechless
[1:18:05] hearing a voice but seeing no man
[1:18:09] acts 22 9 says this
[1:18:11] and they that were with me saw indeed
[1:18:14] the light and were afraid but they heard
[1:18:16] not the voice of him that spake to me
[1:18:19] it says they heard the voice says they
[1:18:22] didn't hear the voice
[1:18:23] all right seems like a contradiction
[1:18:26] right
[1:18:28] do you know the answer
[1:18:31] I don't either sorry sorry I don't have
[1:18:34] to sorry to lift you up
[1:18:37] now I can come up with a solution that
[1:18:39] would work but I flat out don't know
[1:18:43] brother random someone asked him you
[1:18:45] know what brother Brown said
[1:18:49] of course I would know if he said he
[1:18:50] said I don't know
[1:18:53] he did he said you know he said he said
[1:18:55] if you don't know just say you don't
[1:18:56] know
[1:18:58] and and that's this is one of those
[1:19:00] things no it's not a contradiction this
[1:19:03] Bible is inspired and true from Genesis
[1:19:05] to revelation
[1:19:07] and there's many you can look up many
[1:19:09] different explanations to why this seems
[1:19:12] to contradict which one is correct I
[1:19:14] don't know
[1:19:16] so I wanted to mention that if you're
[1:19:17] ever faced with that that question verse
[1:19:21] number eight and Saul arose from the
[1:19:23] Earth
[1:19:24] and when his eyes were opened he saw no
[1:19:26] man but they led him by the hand and
[1:19:29] brought him into Damascus
[1:19:31] and when he was three days without sight
[1:19:33] and neither did eat nor drink
[1:19:36] now this is a serious time for Paul was
[1:19:39] he fasting or was he depressed and upset
[1:19:43] I don't know
[1:19:44] but we know he didn't eat or drink and
[1:19:47] imagine how he felt during this space of
[1:19:49] three days he must have felt so bad I
[1:19:52] bet you Stephen
[1:19:54] kept coming to his mind
[1:19:57] and just just struggling with that Lord
[1:19:59] what have I done
[1:20:01] I mean I make little mistakes and I I
[1:20:04] just I feel terrible this was a Whopper
[1:20:08] that the the Apostle made
[1:20:11] he was he was the chief persecutor of
[1:20:15] God's people and you'll notice
[1:20:17] that Jesus said when Jesus spoke to him
[1:20:21] he said Saul Saul why persecute us thou
[1:20:24] me
[1:20:25] Jesus was not on the Earth
[1:20:29] we don't know if Paul ever knew Jesus we
[1:20:32] don't know if he was ever in a ever in a
[1:20:34] in a meeting we don't know anything we
[1:20:36] don't know there's no record of Paul
[1:20:38] ever seeing him well no we do have a
[1:20:40] record I just read it he didn't see him
[1:20:42] until he was resurrected in the light so
[1:20:45] we know Paul was not never there
[1:20:47] but how could Jesus say
[1:20:50] you're persecuting me
[1:20:52] it was because that he was persecuting
[1:20:55] his people
[1:20:57] so we need to be careful whoever that
[1:21:01] we're talking to or talking about or or
[1:21:04] in any way
[1:21:06] you're against Christ
[1:21:09] you're not against Joe Miller you're not
[1:21:11] against Daniel Evans you're against him
[1:21:14] so we should always use caution
[1:21:27] and there was a certain disciple at
[1:21:29] Damascus named ananias
[1:21:32] and to him said the Lord in a vision
[1:21:35] ananias he said behold I'm here Lord
[1:21:45] I might
[1:21:50] want to go backwards
[1:21:58] you know what let me just read it in the
[1:22:00] good book here
[1:22:02] um
[1:22:02] it says here
[1:22:06] in verse 5. let's go back to verse five
[1:22:08] did I skip that
[1:22:11] it says this
[1:22:13] and he fell to the Earth and heard a
[1:22:15] voice saying unto him Saul saw why
[1:22:18] persecute us thou me and he said who art
[1:22:20] thou Lord
[1:22:21] and said I am Jesus whom thou persecute
[1:22:23] us it is hard for thee to kick against
[1:22:25] the pricks I want to stop there for a
[1:22:27] second I've given the explanation of
[1:22:29] what that is it's a very important
[1:22:31] scripture to me when he says saw Saul
[1:22:33] why persecute it stop me it's hard for
[1:22:34] thee to kick against the Pricks but that
[1:22:37] word kick against the Pricks if you look
[1:22:39] I believe it's in the Scofield I'm not
[1:22:41] sure but that word Pricks is
[1:22:45] also called goads goads and a goad is
[1:22:50] something that you prod cattle with
[1:22:54] so when when he said it's hard for you
[1:22:56] to kick against the Pricks he's saying
[1:22:59] Saul I have been trying to hurt you too
[1:23:02] to the gospel you in your way of
[1:23:05] understanding in in your way of
[1:23:07] believing yeah you're educated you have
[1:23:09] you have a PhD yes you've grown up in
[1:23:11] this message yes you know all of these
[1:23:13] things but it's hard for you because I'm
[1:23:16] trying to move you and you kick against
[1:23:19] me this this goad is a it's it's
[1:23:23] instrument about this long it's a stick
[1:23:25] that's got a point on the end usually
[1:23:27] it's a point made of brass back then
[1:23:29] it's it's pointy and it's got a hook
[1:23:31] that comes back and when when they're
[1:23:34] trying to get the oxes to go into the
[1:23:36] shoot or wherever they poke them to get
[1:23:39] them to go and these oxes will kick back
[1:23:42] or a cow will kick back and they're just
[1:23:45] fighting against the one that's trying
[1:23:47] to push him in there and when they try
[1:23:49] to fight against them they probably get
[1:23:52] hurt worse
[1:23:54] it would be better if we would just go
[1:23:56] where God is leading us instead of being
[1:23:59] like Saul here instead of being so
[1:24:01] caught up in our way of thinking
[1:24:04] but no
[1:24:06] Jesus is like come on
[1:24:09] can't you see I've been trying to hurt
[1:24:12] you and you just kick against me
[1:24:19] and he trembling
[1:24:21] and astonish said Lord what will that
[1:24:23] have me to do and the Lord said unto him
[1:24:25] arise and go into the City and it shall
[1:24:27] be told thee what thou must do
[1:24:29] and the man which journeyed with him
[1:24:31] stood speechless hearing a voice but
[1:24:33] seeing no man
[1:24:34] and Saul Rose from the Earth
[1:24:37] and when his eyes were opened he saw no
[1:24:39] man but they led him by the hand and
[1:24:42] brought him into Damascus and he was
[1:24:44] there for three days without sight and
[1:24:47] neither did eat nor drink and there was
[1:24:49] a certain disciple at Damascus named
[1:24:51] ananias and to him said the Lord in a
[1:24:54] vision ananias and he said behold I'm
[1:24:57] here Lord
[1:24:58] you know one of the things I'll stop
[1:25:00] right there for a second one of the
[1:25:01] things that I've heard so much growing
[1:25:04] up is that God will only speak to his
[1:25:06] prophet
[1:25:12] how many times have we heard that God
[1:25:15] will only speak to his prophet and then
[1:25:17] it'll go out that changed
[1:25:20] at the day of Pentecost now God speaks
[1:25:24] to the individual and we see this man
[1:25:26] ananias we don't know anything about
[1:25:29] you know we don't see him much in the
[1:25:31] scriptures he's just a Christian
[1:25:34] but he was on such a relationship with
[1:25:37] God that Jesus is going to speak to
[1:25:42] ananias right here
[1:25:45] I like ananias
[1:25:48] this isn't the one that was married to
[1:25:50] Sapphira
[1:25:52] they're two different ones
[1:25:56] and there was a certain disciple at
[1:25:58] Damascus named ananias and to him said
[1:26:01] the Lord in the vision ananias and he
[1:26:02] said behold I am here
[1:26:04] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[1:26:07] into the street which is called straight
[1:26:09] and inquire in the house of Judas for
[1:26:12] one called Saul of Tarsus
[1:26:15] for behold he prayeth
[1:26:18] I'd like to preach a sermon on that one
[1:26:20] day
[1:26:22] for behold he prayeth how sweet
[1:26:25] I'm hearing his prayers
[1:26:30] look at the import importance God places
[1:26:33] on prayer here
[1:26:34] and at this point
[1:26:38] he doesn't say that he's a messenger to
[1:26:40] the Gentiles he doesn't say that he's
[1:26:42] going to write most of the New Testament
[1:26:43] he doesn't say any of that he just says
[1:26:45] he's praying
[1:26:49] and had seen in a vision a man named
[1:26:51] ananias coming in and putting his hand
[1:26:54] on him that he might receive his sight
[1:26:56] now the Lord Jesus is telling ananias
[1:26:58] that hey Saul's already heard about this
[1:27:00] and he's expecting you
[1:27:03] then ananias answered
[1:27:09] well let me let me read this and he had
[1:27:11] seen in a vision a man named ananias
[1:27:13] coming in and putting his hand on him
[1:27:14] that he might receive his sight
[1:27:17] then ananias answered Lord
[1:27:20] I have heard by many of this man how
[1:27:24] much evil he hath done to thy Saints at
[1:27:28] Jerusalem
[1:27:30] he's like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:27:32] whoa
[1:27:34] this guy's big time
[1:27:37] this guy is putting people in prison
[1:27:40] he's he's sentencing people to death
[1:27:42] he's I mean he's dangerous and I'm gonna
[1:27:45] go to him and he's got the authority
[1:27:48] here in my city in Damascus from the
[1:27:51] chief priest to do whatever he wants to
[1:27:53] us
[1:27:57] and here he hath The Authority from the
[1:27:59] chief priest to bind all that call on
[1:28:01] thy name but the Lord said unto him go
[1:28:04] thy way
[1:28:05] for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[1:28:08] Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[1:28:11] Kings and the children of Israel
[1:28:14] for I will show him how great things he
[1:28:16] must suffer from my name's sake
[1:28:19] wow
[1:28:21] can you imagine this conversation
[1:28:26] first of all ananias is talking to the
[1:28:28] same resurrected Jesus Christ that Paul
[1:28:30] was talking to and I think about as I
[1:28:34] was I was sitting in the office there
[1:28:35] and I was I was reading this again and I
[1:28:37] was I was like wait a minute
[1:28:39] look at the difference
[1:28:41] between the Lord Jesus and the angel
[1:28:44] Gabriel
[1:28:46] I was thinking whoa ananiah said
[1:28:51] I'm afraid of this guy
[1:28:54] Gabriel comes down and talks to
[1:28:56] Zechariah John the Baptist dad
[1:28:59] and he comes down and he says Zechariah
[1:29:02] God has heard your prayers God is going
[1:29:04] to send you a son and and he's going to
[1:29:07] be this great person and Zachariah says
[1:29:10] how can this happen
[1:29:13] because I'm old
[1:29:14] and Gabriel says listen you're not going
[1:29:18] to speak a word until this child is born
[1:29:21] just rips him
[1:29:23] and he hear the Lord Jesus
[1:29:27] look at the tender hand
[1:29:30] of the Lord he says no ananias he's
[1:29:34] going to do great things and I just
[1:29:37] compared those two and and the Lord
[1:29:39] Jesus is the one Gabriel answers to
[1:29:43] and here here is just
[1:29:45] look at that Spirit difference there
[1:29:52] and ananias went his way
[1:29:55] and entered the house and putting his
[1:29:57] hands on him said brother Saul
[1:30:00] the Lord even Jesus that hath appeared
[1:30:02] unto thee in the way
[1:30:05] as thou Hast as thou came it hath as
[1:30:08] Alchemist hath sent me that thou
[1:30:10] mightest received thy sight and be
[1:30:13] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:16] do you see why we call each other
[1:30:17] brother
[1:30:18] and sister I love this part brother Saul
[1:30:22] how did he say that
[1:30:24] when he went to him
[1:30:27] this guy's big time did he say brother
[1:30:30] Saul God bless you
[1:30:32] I doubt it
[1:30:34] or was it uh
[1:30:36] uh
[1:30:38] brother Saul uh
[1:30:42] or or was it
[1:30:46] brother Saul I would have liked to seen
[1:30:49] that greeting right there
[1:30:53] brother Saul
[1:30:54] the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto
[1:30:57] thee in the way as thou camest hath sent
[1:31:01] me that thou mightest received thy sight
[1:31:03] and be filled with the Holy Ghost and I
[1:31:05] want to point out something else in your
[1:31:07] King James Bible
[1:31:09] if you look at that verse 17 right there
[1:31:11] it won't show it on here
[1:31:13] but verse 17
[1:31:17] it reads like this and ananias went his
[1:31:19] way and entered into the house and
[1:31:21] putting his hands on him said brother
[1:31:23] Saul the Lord even Jesus do you see how
[1:31:27] even is in italics
[1:31:28] you know what that means
[1:31:30] it means that that word was added
[1:31:35] to the text
[1:31:36] that the King James translators it
[1:31:39] doesn't make sense Hebrew does not
[1:31:42] directly translate to English and here
[1:31:44] Greek doesn't directly translate to
[1:31:46] English it doesn't make sense if you do
[1:31:49] that so these translators they have to
[1:31:51] input words in there to make it make
[1:31:54] sense
[1:31:55] I'm not I when I read my Bible I read
[1:31:59] different translations I really like the
[1:32:00] English Standard Version so I'm not a
[1:32:02] King James only type of person but I do
[1:32:05] really appreciate the King James that
[1:32:07] they they'll put that in italics just to
[1:32:09] say hey we added this just so you know
[1:32:12] so it'll make sense
[1:32:14] that's what you get when we get a Bible
[1:32:16] study
[1:32:21] um
[1:32:25] let me read that again and ananias went
[1:32:26] his way and entered the house and
[1:32:28] putting his hands on him said brother
[1:32:30] Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared
[1:32:33] unto thee in the way as thou acamest
[1:32:36] hath sent me that thou mightest receive
[1:32:38] thy sight and be filled with the Holy
[1:32:41] Ghost
[1:32:45] I I do appreciate this ananias again
[1:32:48] thinking of brother Jonathan's sermon
[1:32:50] this morning
[1:32:51] ananias didn't judge Saul
[1:32:55] I mean in in you can imagine these
[1:32:58] conversations among the Believers
[1:33:00] running him down
[1:33:03] Sam what a creep this guy is and how
[1:33:06] evil he is and all of this but here
[1:33:09] comes ananias gives him the right hand
[1:33:11] of Fellowship says brother Saul
[1:33:15] further
[1:33:18] and immediately that fell from his eyes
[1:33:22] as it had been scales and he received
[1:33:25] sight for with and arose and was
[1:33:28] baptized
[1:33:30] now most importantly in that scripture
[1:33:32] we see Paul
[1:33:34] Saul was baptized just like any other
[1:33:36] believers of Jesus
[1:33:38] he had to come the same way
[1:33:40] now one thing that is very interesting
[1:33:43] to me we don't see how Saul reacted to
[1:33:46] receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:33:48] I don't think it's anywhere in the Bible
[1:33:50] I haven't found it how this man saw
[1:33:54] did he speak in tongues
[1:33:56] did he did it just did he just accept it
[1:33:59] and the Holy Ghost came in we don't
[1:34:01] really see that testimony did it happen
[1:34:03] right here when he was baptized we don't
[1:34:04] know
[1:34:05] but we know that the prophecy was that
[1:34:07] you would receive the Holy Ghost and we
[1:34:09] know if anybody had the Holy Ghost it
[1:34:11] was it was Paul
[1:34:13] but in this I don't necessarily see a
[1:34:16] place where he received it
[1:34:19] and how he received it which encourages
[1:34:22] me because I can just see that everyone
[1:34:24] receives it in different ways
[1:34:27] and I believe this man saw I don't know
[1:34:30] how it entered into him by by the laying
[1:34:33] on the hands or whatever it was but I do
[1:34:35] appreciate the author here Luke maybe
[1:34:39] not putting it in there I don't know if
[1:34:41] he did it on purpose I don't know if
[1:34:43] Paul said don't do it but
[1:34:46] from my studies and brother Lyle maybe
[1:34:49] you'll get to it when you come to it I
[1:34:51] haven't seen
[1:34:52] the actual time like when Peter received
[1:34:55] it we know the actual time when the
[1:34:57] disciples received it when Cornelius
[1:34:58] received it when all these ones received
[1:35:00] it we see the time but not in in this
[1:35:03] brother
[1:35:05] and
[1:35:06] I do uh I also want to mention as as
[1:35:10] we're our times winding down wow I uh
[1:35:14] didn't even get as far as I thought
[1:35:17] um
[1:35:17] I want to mention this
[1:35:21] that it says here and immediately there
[1:35:25] fell from his eyes as it had been scales
[1:35:28] and he received sight for with and arose
[1:35:32] and was baptized so
[1:35:35] the Apostle here was healed at that
[1:35:39] moment
[1:35:40] these scales fell off
[1:35:42] and he received his sight but I've heard
[1:35:46] so many times a statement
[1:35:50] that it sounds really good
[1:35:53] but we have to be careful when things
[1:35:55] just sound good and this one sounds
[1:35:57] really good
[1:35:59] I have heard
[1:36:01] when people are praying for healing or
[1:36:03] their their their seeking their healing
[1:36:05] and God starts to do something I've
[1:36:08] heard people say that God doesn't do
[1:36:09] things halfway
[1:36:12] that you'll receive it'll be completely
[1:36:15] gone
[1:36:17] that's not according to scripture
[1:36:20] and I
[1:36:21] I know that we we think that oh this is
[1:36:24] this is Jesus and Jesus healed Saul and
[1:36:27] and and the scales fell down or um this
[1:36:31] person was healed of cancer but but then
[1:36:33] later on they get cancer again
[1:36:37] friends we are all going to if God
[1:36:39] doesn't come everyone in this room is
[1:36:41] going to get sick and die
[1:36:43] every one of us
[1:36:45] if Jesus doesn't come
[1:36:47] so when when we say things like that no
[1:36:51] God can heal us and he does heal us of
[1:36:54] cancer I've seen people completely
[1:36:56] healed of cancer but I've also seen
[1:36:58] people like my mother who was honored
[1:37:01] deathbed Stephanie was there Daniel was
[1:37:04] there my mom could not even get up out
[1:37:07] of a chair and walk
[1:37:10] she was so bad stage four breast cancer
[1:37:12] she couldn't move she couldn't raise her
[1:37:15] arms she couldn't do hardly anything and
[1:37:18] we were there we were we were having a
[1:37:21] worship service and we prayed for my mom
[1:37:23] and the Lord came in and healed her
[1:37:28] honey she stood up you remember
[1:37:31] she hadn't stood up for weeks
[1:37:35] she was so bad
[1:37:37] so eaten up with cancer she stood up
[1:37:41] that arm that had been six months that
[1:37:44] she couldn't raise she raised raised
[1:37:46] both of those arms up
[1:37:48] and was worshiping the Lord with us the
[1:37:52] next day not a week later the next day
[1:37:56] she hiked in Charlestown State Park
[1:37:59] she hadn't been able to walk in months
[1:38:02] she couldn't she was out hiking and
[1:38:04] going yet later
[1:38:07] God took her with cancer
[1:38:09] but it was still to the glory of God
[1:38:12] so when when people say those things
[1:38:15] they mean well but they're not
[1:38:17] necessarily scripture Galatians chapter
[1:38:20] 6.
[1:38:23] says this verse 11.
[1:38:27] this is Paul the Apostle again writing a
[1:38:29] letter
[1:38:31] and he says this you see how large a
[1:38:35] letter I have written unto you with my
[1:38:37] own hand
[1:38:39] it's a little hint that Paul struggled
[1:38:43] with his eyesight from that point to the
[1:38:46] rest of his life
[1:38:48] he even says he did in other places
[1:38:51] sometimes he says he has a thorn in his
[1:38:53] flesh some people say it was his
[1:38:54] eyesight because we know that that he
[1:38:57] did struggle with his eyesight other
[1:38:58] people say it was sickness I don't
[1:38:59] really know what it was but Paul we do
[1:39:03] know after he was healed and he was
[1:39:07] healed
[1:39:08] he struggled with his eyesight
[1:39:11] so we see that God has his perfect way
[1:39:15] of doing it
[1:39:17] and his ways are not our ways his ways
[1:39:20] are perfect our ways aren't
[1:39:24] Let's uh let's have the musicians come
[1:39:27] friends I'm sorry I was so slow I just
[1:39:29] love this this book so much
[1:39:34] brother Lyle sorry my friend I'm gonna
[1:39:36] have to we're gonna have to to come back
[1:39:40] to this this one
[1:39:42] and when he had received meat he was
[1:39:44] strengthened then was Saul certain days
[1:39:47] with the disciples which were at
[1:39:49] Damascus and straightway he preached
[1:39:51] Christ in the synagogues that he is the
[1:39:54] Son of God but all that hurt him were
[1:39:56] amazed and said is not this he that
[1:39:59] destroyed them which called on his name
[1:40:01] on this name in Jerusalem and came
[1:40:03] hither for that intent that he might
[1:40:05] bring them bound under the chief priests
[1:40:08] but Saul increased the more look at the
[1:40:11] overcomer
[1:40:12] all of the stuff that it was set against
[1:40:14] solid and he could have just quit quit
[1:40:17] and went back to the synagogue but he
[1:40:19] stayed with it God bless the Apostle
[1:40:23] Paul God bless his life
[1:40:26] then Saul was certain days with the
[1:40:28] disciples that were Damascus and
[1:40:30] straightway he preached Christ in the
[1:40:32] synagogues that he is the Son of God
[1:40:34] Amen way to go
[1:40:37] Saul keep doing it
[1:40:40] but all that heard him were amazed and
[1:40:42] said is not this he that destroyed them
[1:40:45] which called on the name on this name in
[1:40:47] Jerusalem and came hither for that
[1:40:50] intent that he might bring them bound
[1:40:52] into the chief priests
[1:40:54] but Saul increased the more in strength
[1:40:57] this is his own people the Christians
[1:41:00] are are saying this but Saul increased
[1:41:03] the more in strength and confounded the
[1:41:05] Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving
[1:41:08] that this is very Christ all the other
[1:41:13] translations that I looked at says
[1:41:14] proving that this is the very Christ
[1:41:18] and after that many days were fulfilled
[1:41:21] the Jews took counsel to kill him you
[1:41:24] know how
[1:41:25] soon are friends forsake us
[1:41:28] yeah this is just right after
[1:41:31] Paul got his conversion all of his
[1:41:34] friends in the synagogues all of his
[1:41:36] fellow Pharisees
[1:41:38] they're right there and they they turned
[1:41:42] against him and even so they conspired
[1:41:45] to kill him
[1:41:49] hmm
[1:41:51] I don't see any of Paul's friends old
[1:41:54] friends the Pharisees sticking with them
[1:41:56] there may have been some
[1:41:58] but they're not that I can see they're
[1:42:01] not recorded
[1:42:05] but they're laying in weight
[1:42:08] was known of Saul these people are
[1:42:10] trying to kill him
[1:42:12] and they watched the gates day and night
[1:42:14] to kill him then the disciples took him
[1:42:16] by night and let him down by the wall in
[1:42:18] the basket ah he's starting to get
[1:42:20] accepted by the disciples now and when
[1:42:22] Saul was come to Jerusalem he is saved
[1:42:24] to join himself to the disciples but
[1:42:27] they were all afraid of him and believe
[1:42:29] not that he was a disciple
[1:42:33] look at that
[1:42:35] and Saul was come to Jerusalem and he
[1:42:38] said he was he wanted to join himself
[1:42:39] with the disciples but they were afraid
[1:42:41] of him and believed not that he was a
[1:42:44] disciple for heaven's sakes these are
[1:42:47] the people that are casting out Devils
[1:42:49] these are the people that are causing uh
[1:42:51] cripples to walk these are the people
[1:42:53] that are raising the dead and they can't
[1:42:56] believe
[1:42:57] that this man was converted and there's
[1:43:00] thousands of converts just coming all
[1:43:02] the time and they can't believe that
[1:43:04] this man's Saul of Tarsus is a convert
[1:43:07] that's how bad he was
[1:43:11] I mean he was worse than the guy at the
[1:43:13] gate called Beautiful
[1:43:15] when his in his crippled this man saw
[1:43:18] they couldn't even they couldn't believe
[1:43:19] that
[1:43:21] I stood up when I read that
[1:43:24] come on are you serious
[1:43:29] all right I'll close with Barnabas I
[1:43:32] like Barnabas and Barnabas took him and
[1:43:35] brought him to the apostles and declared
[1:43:37] unto them
[1:43:39] how he had seen the Lord in the way and
[1:43:42] that he had spoken to him and how he had
[1:43:44] preached boldly at Damascus in the name
[1:43:46] of Jesus now remember Barnabas this is
[1:43:49] the guy that sold his land
[1:43:51] and gave it gave it all to the disciples
[1:43:53] he was somebody that had great respect
[1:43:56] and look at how this man that had such
[1:43:59] respect among the disciples
[1:44:03] he vouched for him
[1:44:05] he said no he's a servant he's a servant
[1:44:07] of God
[1:44:11] and when he was with them coming in and
[1:44:14] going out of Jerusalem and he was with
[1:44:16] them coming in and going out at
[1:44:18] Jerusalem then he spiked boldly in the
[1:44:20] name of the Lord Jesus and disputed
[1:44:23] against the grecians
[1:44:25] but they went about to slay in
[1:44:31] let's close there
[1:44:34] I like this let me read that verse
[1:44:36] number 27 one more time but Barnabas
[1:44:38] took him and brought him to the apostles
[1:44:41] and declared unto them how he had seen
[1:44:44] the Lord in the way
[1:44:45] he was he was given the testimony hey
[1:44:47] here's what happened to him
[1:44:49] here's Paul's testimony
[1:44:54] how he had seen the Lord and the Lord in
[1:44:56] the way that he had spoken to him and
[1:44:58] how he had preached boldly at Damascus
[1:45:01] in the name of the Lord Jesus so here's
[1:45:04] brother Barnabas and he's saying oh this
[1:45:08] guy's the real deal
[1:45:10] he's a Christian he loves the Lord he's
[1:45:14] been preaching the same thing that we've
[1:45:16] been preaching he's been successful in
[1:45:18] doing it and by the way he's got one of
[1:45:20] the most amazing testimonies that you've
[1:45:22] ever heard in your life that's this man
[1:45:25] Saul I got Jordan back there
[1:45:29] laughs
[1:45:31] think about Barnabas
[1:45:33] think about that great man
[1:45:35] and here he is laying his reputation on
[1:45:38] the line
[1:45:40] for this man's song
[1:45:43] and we see now that the Lord had blessed
[1:45:45] him and and what a great ministry what a
[1:45:50] great ministry this man had and it's
[1:45:53] starting right here
[1:45:55] in the book of Acts chapter 9. would you
[1:45:58] love it don't you love it this is how it
[1:46:01] all got started
[1:46:02] we're a Christian Church
[1:46:04] right here this is a Christian Church
[1:46:06] these all started 2 000 years ago in
[1:46:09] Jerusalem
[1:46:10] and now they're spreading up to Damascus
[1:46:12] we got we got ananias up there and
[1:46:16] Damascus and and Barnabas up there
[1:46:20] feels good feels good to have have a
[1:46:23] church that we can Fellowship in that
[1:46:25] that we can worship in and it all
[1:46:29] started right there friends I'll get to
[1:46:31] I'll finish the book of Acts chapter 9
[1:46:33] on Wednesday let's stand
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:45] Jordan
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:59] [Applause]
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:08] just
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:35] foreign
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:48:07] all realize
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:30] it was in prayer for the Andy Andre
[1:48:33] would you come in close in prayer my
[1:48:34] brother
[1:48:48] foreign
[1:48:53] [Applause]
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:22] so when we hear about the ax
[1:49:25] what what our boy was saying about the
[1:49:27] apostles
[1:49:29] it can encourage us to
[1:49:32] to have Grace toward each other
[1:49:34] that means I can see that Apostles they
[1:49:37] were not perfect they were men
[1:49:39] so even What the Lord Has Done for Paul
[1:49:42] it was difficult for them to accept Paul
[1:49:45] in their among I mean among them
[1:49:48] so you see so that means like they were
[1:49:51] humans
[1:49:52] but also filled with the Holy Ghost so
[1:49:55] that doesn't mean when you have the Holy
[1:49:57] Ghost you don't go to trials you don't
[1:49:59] have that's why we have differences in
[1:50:01] the message because we are humans
[1:50:03] so what
[1:50:05] we can be sure
[1:50:07] that the Holy Spirit who started to work
[1:50:09] will complete it in US
[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:13] amen
[1:50:15] do you have any father
[1:50:17] you are the same yesterday today and
[1:50:19] forever
[1:50:20] oh God we want to be like
[1:50:25] a nice
[1:50:27] but you know
[1:50:29] God that's what we want to be we want to
[1:50:31] be like the disciple who are so
[1:50:34] dedicated that you can come to him that
[1:50:38] he was so we were so real to him that he
[1:50:42] was a friend talking to another friend
