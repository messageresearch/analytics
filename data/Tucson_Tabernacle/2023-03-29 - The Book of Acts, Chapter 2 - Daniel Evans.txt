[16:03] about his healing of his cleansing power
[16:08] revealing how we made the lane to walk
[16:13] again and cause the blind to sing and
[16:18] then I cry dear Jesus come and heal my
[16:23] broken spirit

[38:10] yesterday we were
[38:13] up there and we got some help and we
[38:16] were working on this room that we're
[38:18] working on for the for the kids upstairs
[38:20] and uh
[38:22] I was standing up there and I was
[38:23] painting and uh hear this voice
[38:27] hello
[38:31] I said
[38:32] Daniel did you hear something hello
[38:35] So Daniel walks out and it's these these
[38:39] uh these sweet girls
[38:41] and they they said uh sister Roberto was
[38:45] there but the murder was there Daniel
[38:46] and I and and they said oh we used to go
[38:48] to school here
[38:50] and uh So Daniel
[38:53] uh took them and and took them the tour
[38:55] of the building here and and then in the
[38:59] area over there and they started showing
[39:02] Daniel well oh this is over here and and
[39:05] oh that's over there and they they went
[39:07] and they were showing Daniel they gave
[39:08] Daniel the tour of the church
[39:11] and and then they went into the school
[39:13] room and didn't you find some letters
[39:15] from your brother or something like that
[39:16] oh man so they they spent like an hour
[39:19] going through the church and and showing
[39:22] my son how uh
[39:25] I used to I used to run and all kind of
[39:28] some secret things that we had so real
[39:31] blessing and
[39:33] um come to find out they're related to
[39:36] Sister Amelia
[39:38] and sister Salazar God bless you it's
[39:41] it's good to it's good to meet you and
[39:43] it's good to have you in service today
[39:46] but Daniel came back

[39:53] this is the sweetest girls they have the
[39:55] sweetest spirit and Daniel's like I know
[39:58] Dad they just you know they seem to love
[40:00] the Lord and and just made a good
[40:02] impression on us so so welcome and here
[40:05] they are in church God bless you
[40:06] [Applause]
[40:12] it's good to see you and sister Salazar
[40:13] you're um you're a veteran you're a
[40:17] native welcome home God bless you
[40:20] we've been talking
[40:22] I felt it on my heart
[40:23] to start talking about on maybe
[40:26] Wednesday nights to start on a Bible
[40:29] study and last week we were into the
[40:33] first chapter of the book of Acts
[40:37] and if there is a book in this entire
[40:41] Bible that we should know it's that book
[40:44] of Acts it's got everything it's got
[40:47] doctrines like the godhead and baptism
[40:50] it's got miracles it's it's got
[40:53] missionary work it's got it all all
[40:56] packed into this one book so in Acts
[40:59] chapter 1
[41:01] we it starts with the this letter that's
[41:06] addressed to this man theopolis
[41:08] and the the name sounds familiar
[41:12] so it talks it says to theopolis it says
[41:16] it says Theo theopolis this second essay
[41:20] that I am writing to you
[41:24] the first one was about all that Jesus
[41:28] said
[41:30] and all that Jesus started
[41:33] to do
[41:35] and and it talks about this first book
[41:37] about about all these things that Jesus
[41:39] did and then this writer is writing
[41:42] makes it sound like this is the second
[41:45] book
[41:46] so we look back and we see that there is
[41:50] another book in the Bible That's
[41:52] addressed to this same guy theopolis
[41:55] and it's the Book of Luke
[41:57] so we as we read we can see that almost
[42:00] with no doubt that the same author that
[42:04] wrote the book of Acts is the same
[42:06] author that wrote the Book of Luke
[42:09] which is
[42:11] Luke that's a pretty easy question so
[42:14] so we see that Luke is the author of
[42:17] This Book of Acts and and he lays this
[42:20] Foundation
[42:21] to this to this man who is I'm sure very
[42:25] very interested of what's going on in
[42:28] Jerusalem at this time what's going on
[42:31] with the Believers around the world in
[42:33] this new thing called Christianity
[42:36] so
[42:37] he says he lays this Foundation he says
[42:40] all that Jesus began to do and teach and
[42:43] then he he talks about Jesus and how
[42:45] that he appeared to the disciples after
[42:48] his death and his burial and he rose up
[42:52] and he appeared to the disciples and he
[42:54] said that he go up to this place go to
[42:58] Jerusalem and wait there
[43:01] until you are endued with power from on
[43:04] high
[43:05] and then Luke talks about how Jesus went
[43:08] up
[43:09] into the sky and these disciples are
[43:12] watching it and then these two men come
[43:14] to them and said Hey listen he says this
[43:17] Jesus that went up he's going to come
[43:19] down in the same way that he went up one
[43:23] day
[43:24] so the the disciples there they're I'm
[43:27] sure they're tremendously excited but
[43:30] then they were also being persecuted and
[43:31] threatened to death
[43:33] so then they go
[43:35] and they go into this place exactly as
[43:39] Jesus instructed them
[43:41] into this place in Jerusalem and we call
[43:45] it the upper room it was a room that was
[43:47] probably on top of a building of a small
[43:50] building
[43:52] so let's dig in to the word
[43:56] let's go to Acts chapter 2.
[43:59] now we call this the day of Pentecost
[44:05] it's a very very interesting thing that
[44:09] happened and like I said besides maybe
[44:12] the death and resurrection of our Lord
[44:17] Jesus this is probably the single most
[44:21] important thing that had ever happened
[44:23] in all of history
[44:25] you could say well
[44:27] what about when God created the heavens
[44:30] and the Earth
[44:31] what would have been for nothing
[44:33] well what about when God created man and
[44:35] God created his wife what about then
[44:37] well it would have been nothing they
[44:39] would have all died and been lost if it
[44:43] wasn't for these times this this Lord
[44:46] Jesus when he died and was resurrected
[44:49] and then at this day of Pentecost we're
[44:51] going to see that this was the time that
[44:56] Jesus
[44:58] went from a man
[45:02] into a spirit that dwelt in 120 people
[45:05] all at one time
[45:07] a tremendous time in history
[45:10] now when we say Pentecost
[45:13] Pentecost is
[45:16] it's a Jewish feast day it's like it's
[45:18] like a um it's like a holiday
[45:21] and what it was is it was it just means
[45:24] 50 days Pentecost just the word just
[45:26] means 50 days and what it was is it was
[45:30] after the Passover
[45:33] then 50 days later you know the Passover
[45:36] when Moses was here and and the death
[45:38] angel came and and they were eating the
[45:41] unleavened bread in in the house and
[45:43] they put the the blood of the Lamb on
[45:45] the doorpost and on the on the side
[45:47] there and then after that 50 days later
[45:51] they celebrated another holiday which is
[45:57] say it brother Lyle yes just like he
[46:01] said it
[46:02] they celebrated that holiday
[46:05] and and basically as I said 50 Pentecost
[46:10] just means 50. so what's really
[46:13] interesting here before we even get
[46:15] started is we know exactly when the day
[46:18] of Pentecost was
[46:21] so we had
[46:22] the um
[46:25] the the uh the Feast of the Passover
[46:27] remember Jesus got his disciples
[46:29] together
[46:31] and they ate the communion we call it
[46:33] the communion which was the Feast of the
[46:35] Passover
[46:36] 50 days from that time
[46:40] is when this happened
[46:43] so Jesus died Jesus went to the cross
[46:46] the next day
[46:48] so maybe 49 days after it after he went
[46:52] to the cross
[46:53] and we can just count down the days
[46:56] until less than two months later
[46:59] this Spirit comes down on the disciples
[47:02] Acts chapter 2.
[47:06] verse one my friend
[47:08] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[47:10] come
[47:12] they were all with one Accord
[47:15] in one place that when it says when the
[47:17] day of Pentecost had fully come that
[47:18] means it had arrived that that was the
[47:21] day
[47:23] and uh
[47:26] and suddenly
[47:28] there came a sound from heaven
[47:30] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[47:33] filled all the house where they were
[47:35] sitting and there appeared unto them
[47:37] cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat
[47:40] upon each of them
[47:43] and
[47:44] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:48] and began to speak with other tongues as
[47:52] the spirit gave them utterance
[47:55] now listen this is the very first
[48:00] Christian Church that ever was
[48:04] it started with 120 people and it Formed
[48:08] right here on this day that I that we
[48:12] are talking about right now this is the
[48:14] beginning this is the beginning of of
[48:16] what's happened throughout the world
[48:18] and you'll notice that this first
[48:21] outpouring of the Holy Spirit it came in
[48:24] three ways
[48:27] first it came in an audible way
[48:32] and it was the sound of a rushing Mighty
[48:35] Wind
[48:37] and if you'll notice you can look back
[48:39] through the Old Testament and you can
[48:42] see that
[48:43] the Lord spoke to job
[48:46] in a whirlwind
[48:48] the Lord
[48:49] spoke to David he knew it was time to go
[48:52] to battle when he heard that wind go
[48:54] through the mulberry trees
[48:56] so we can see that this isn't something
[48:58] new this is something that God had done
[49:00] before and it was the sound of this and
[49:04] as I was Reese as I was looking at this
[49:06] the Hebrew and the Greek words for wind
[49:11] are the same word for Spirit
[49:14] tremendous Little Nugget there
[49:18] and then
[49:20] when this when this
[49:22] sound now it wasn't necessarily a win it
[49:24] was just the sound of this of this
[49:27] rushing Mighty Wind came through then
[49:29] and it was about it was maybe twice as
[49:31] many people as in this room right now
[49:33] maybe a little less than that they were
[49:37] they were there and then
[49:40] these these pillars of Fire
[49:45] came down and rested over each one
[49:50] this is the second we heard we hear it
[49:52] first audibly with the rushing Mighty
[49:55] Wind and then we see it visibly it's not
[50:00] fire the hair didn't catch on fire
[50:03] it was
[50:04] fire like the burning bush we look back
[50:08] you see how God used fire there didn't
[50:11] consume the bush but it looked like fire
[50:16] it's a symbol of God that that that has
[50:20] been used many many times over
[50:22] and then
[50:24] there was there was they heard that
[50:26] audibly
[50:27] then they saw it visibly
[50:31] and then it came orally
[50:35] in speaking
[50:37] with tongues
[50:39] with and it was it was a very very cool
[50:42] thing that happened right there very
[50:44] very different than some than what they
[50:46] had heard before but we'll get to that
[50:50] here in a minute
[50:51] and there were dwelling at Jerusalem
[50:54] Jews devout men out of every nation
[50:56] under heaven now when this was noised
[50:58] abroad the multitude came together and
[51:01] were confounded because that every man
[51:03] heard them speak in his own language
[51:09] and they were all amazed and marveled
[51:12] saying one to another behold are not
[51:14] these which would speak galileans
[51:17] now people from the certain part of the
[51:19] country had different accents
[51:21] and every whenever they heard they heard
[51:24] this they they spoke exactly like they
[51:28] did
[51:29] with the exact maybe same accent as the
[51:31] person hearing it or maybe the same
[51:33] language as the person hearing it
[51:36] how here we every man in our own own
[51:40] tongue wherein we were born parthians
[51:43] and medes and elamites and dwellers in
[51:46] Mesopotamia and in Judea and in
[51:48] Cappadocia in Pontius and Asia frigia
[51:51] and pamphilia in Egypt and in the parts
[51:53] of Libya about Cyrene and strangers of
[51:57] Rome Jews and proselytes cretes and
[52:00] Arabians we do hear them speak in our
[52:03] tongues the wonderful works of God
[52:10] this was a necessity
[52:14] they needed to have this
[52:18] the church had formed with 120 in that
[52:21] upper room they were filled with the
[52:23] Holy Spirit now they had to go out
[52:26] and they they weren't necessarily
[52:28] preaching the gospel they were
[52:30] testifying of what God had done in their
[52:33] lives they were testifying of what they
[52:36] had seen and heard these wonderful works
[52:39] of God that that they had seen
[52:42] and they were speaking in languages that
[52:46] was from were familiar to the people
[52:49] that were hearing them
[52:51] I gave a testimony
[52:53] not too long ago about a brother that I
[52:56] had met from Congo
[52:59] and this brother
[53:01] he had a desire in his heart
[53:05] to bring the gospel
[53:07] to the pygmies
[53:10] in Central and Northern Congo
[53:13] the problem that he faced is he didn't
[53:15] speak the language
[53:17] a huge barrier
[53:19] that if I'm going to witness to somebody
[53:21] that maybe speaks Spanish and I can only
[53:23] get out a couple words I'm not going to
[53:25] do a good job
[53:27] so his name's um Alfred tischbango so so
[53:30] brother Alfred was
[53:31] he prayed and he he fasted and he said
[53:34] Lord I need to know this language if you
[53:36] want me to bring the gospel to these to
[53:39] these idolaters in the jungle
[53:42] so
[53:43] he prayed and he fasted
[53:47] the Lord later on his heart to fast and
[53:49] he fasted for seven days
[53:52] and at the end of his fast he got hungry
[53:56] and he sat down he made himself a nice
[53:59] meal and he sat down
[54:02] and he prayed over his food
[54:06] and he began speaking in the native
[54:08] tongue of the pygmy people and today he
[54:12] may be there right now
[54:13] today brother Alfred is spreading the
[54:17] gospel to the people in the jungles to
[54:19] the to these pygmy people
[54:21] oh yeah
[54:24] this led
[54:26] to to another story this led
[54:31] to the the gospel just being spread
[54:34] throughout these jungles and and it was
[54:37] spreading in areas where there were
[54:39] gorillas
[54:42] and
[54:44] it was going throughout this this area
[54:46] so
[54:47] I got a phone call
[54:49] when I was in Jeffersonville I got a
[54:51] phone call from a reporter in England
[54:55] and this reporter you know they talk
[54:58] funny anyways the the people from
[55:00] England
[55:01] and he said yes he says uh I would just
[55:04] like to know and I was in and of course
[55:06] you know I was I was in William Branham
[55:08] Ministries
[55:09] and he says I I would like to I would
[55:12] like to ask you a question he says do
[55:13] the uh did William Branham did he teach
[55:17] that
[55:19] people should eat monkeys
[55:23] and you know I was like oh great this is
[55:26] a setup what's gonna happen
[55:29] and I was okay you know this is gonna be
[55:32] the newspapers or something he's a
[55:33] reporter he's I think he was in London
[55:36] and I said uh I don't know what you mean
[55:39] he said he said well did he teach that
[55:42] that people should eat monkeys namely
[55:44] great apes
[55:47] I said
[55:49] bro I don't know what you're talking
[55:51] about I said he was he was actually a
[55:53] game warden he didn't teach that you
[55:55] should kill anything that you that you
[55:57] can't eat and and he didn't he didn't
[56:00] teach any of that and so he we go back
[56:02] and forth for a while and I am as
[56:03] confused as you can be
[56:06] and
[56:07] finally he leveled with me
[56:10] and he said listen
[56:12] he said these pygmies
[56:16] and these other Bantu tribes in the
[56:19] jungles he said they worshiped
[56:24] the Apes the gorillas
[56:27] he said they they worshiped them because
[56:30] they thought that they were
[56:31] Reincarnation of their ancestors
[56:35] and he said when your message goes into
[56:38] these jungles
[56:40] he said they no longer fear these and he
[56:44] said they started eating them
[56:48] he said Can you issue an edict or
[56:50] something to to get them to stop I said
[56:53] no brother I said we're not we're not
[56:55] Catholic I mean they're on their own
[56:58] there's nothing I can do
[57:01] um I don't know why I told that story
[57:11] um speaking in tongues
[57:13] is something that it's uh
[57:16] it came in two different ways I told you
[57:19] another story of there was a brother
[57:21] that's a dear friend of mine there was
[57:23] an altar call
[57:24] and there were some French Canadians
[57:27] there
[57:28] and there was a sister she was kneeling
[57:31] down at the altar and she was praying
[57:34] and she was asking the Lord for certain
[57:39] things and my friend came up to her and
[57:42] he laid his hand on her
[57:44] and he prayed for her
[57:47] now her first language was French but
[57:50] she still spoke English
[57:52] and afterwards
[57:55] she told my friend she says brother you
[57:58] speak perfect French
[58:01] and he says I've never I can't speak a
[58:03] word of French
[58:05] and he's and she said when you came to
[58:07] me and you were praying for me she said
[58:10] I heard you in perfect French
[58:13] perfect Quebec French
[58:16] it was the same thing that was going on
[58:19] here in the book of Acts where when they
[58:22] were witnessing about these things and
[58:24] they were spreading the gospel they were
[58:27] maybe speaking like I'm speaking but
[58:29] people were Hearing in their own
[58:30] language
[58:31] it was a miracle now there's a
[58:34] difference between the two dif there's
[58:37] there's a different type of speaking in
[58:39] tongues that Paul addresses in First
[58:41] Corinthians chapter 14.
[58:44] in First Corinthians chapter 14
[58:47] it's an unknown tongue
[58:50] it's a tongue that doesn't mean anything
[58:52] to you and me
[58:54] and Paul said that when you speak in in
[58:57] an unknown tongue that there needs to be
[59:00] an interpreter there and then when that
[59:02] interpreter interprets what you're
[59:04] speaking then it becomes prophecy to the
[59:07] church
[59:08] and he and he he admonishes them he says
[59:11] now now when you're speaking in tongues
[59:14] and there's no interpreter or you're
[59:17] just maybe just worshiping
[59:19] and I've seen I've myself
[59:22] have been worshiping and just started
[59:25] speaking in tongues
[59:27] and I've and and other people and he's
[59:29] and Paul said now when you do that don't
[59:34] draw attention to yourself and stand up
[59:36] in church and and speak in tongues
[59:38] because
[59:39] the visitors won't know what you're
[59:41] doing
[59:42] he said keep that to yourself
[59:44] and he makes one statement he says the
[59:46] spirit of the Prophet is subject to the
[59:49] prophet so the spirit of the one giving
[59:51] the prophecy
[59:54] is subject to that person so that person
[59:56] has control they don't have they don't
[59:58] have to give the prophecy they can wait
[1:00:00] until the appropriate time
[1:00:03] but this in this case so there's there's
[1:00:06] different types of speaking in tongues
[1:00:07] but in this case they were speaking like
[1:00:10] brother shebango they were speaking in
[1:00:12] an audible language that they understood
[1:00:16] this happened
[1:00:18] I just thought this happened with
[1:00:20] brother Branham
[1:00:21] when there was a man named Danny Henry
[1:00:25] that was coming
[1:00:26] in the prayer line and he came up to
[1:00:29] brother Branham and there was witnesses
[1:00:31] around and he started speaking
[1:00:34] in tongues
[1:00:36] and this man didn't speak another
[1:00:38] language and it turns out from the
[1:00:40] people around it it was French that he
[1:00:43] was speaking in and there was different
[1:00:45] ones that wrote down the translation you
[1:00:47] know the story they wrote down the
[1:00:49] translation and they both gave the exact
[1:00:51] same interpretation that is the same
[1:00:54] thing that happened at the day of
[1:00:55] Pentecost here
[1:00:57] verse 12.
[1:00:59] and they were all amazed and were in
[1:01:01] doubt saying one to another what mean is
[1:01:04] this
[1:01:05] others mocking
[1:01:07] and said these men are full of new wine
[1:01:10] now this is a Bible study so I want to
[1:01:12] make sure we don't go too far without
[1:01:14] understanding what we're reading what is
[1:01:16] this this word new wine what does that
[1:01:20] mean
[1:01:22] the wine
[1:01:24] as I was as I was looking and I said
[1:01:26] Lord I want to understand what this new
[1:01:28] wine is does it mean like the the cheap
[1:01:30] wine that hasn't been maybe fermented as
[1:01:33] long or what there's there's new wine
[1:01:36] that's in a positive context in the
[1:01:39] Bible so as I studied this
[1:01:42] this is the only time that this certain
[1:01:45] Greek word is used in the Bible
[1:01:48] and what it is is it's probably a very
[1:01:54] sweet wine that has a really high
[1:01:57] alcohol content
[1:01:59] now the wine back then was fairly weak
[1:02:04] it was very common didn't have a lot of
[1:02:06] alcohol in it but this was probably a
[1:02:08] very very strong wine that had that had
[1:02:11] a lot of sugar added to it when they
[1:02:13] were in the fermenting process
[1:02:15] and
[1:02:17] it's uh
[1:02:20] what it was was these people
[1:02:24] were making fun of what was going on
[1:02:28] they were ridiculing they were mocking
[1:02:30] these people that that had received the
[1:02:33] Holy Spirit and they went out and they
[1:02:35] were speaking in these these tongues and
[1:02:37] it didn't it didn't quite mesh maybe
[1:02:39] with the way they thought the way they
[1:02:40] believed so they were trying to find
[1:02:42] something to criticize them with but you
[1:02:46] look at it and say how could wine make
[1:02:48] you speak in other languages real
[1:02:50] languages it was ridiculous but they
[1:02:52] were just trying to they were trying to
[1:02:54] criticize
[1:02:56] but Peter
[1:02:58] standing up with the 11 lifted up his
[1:03:02] voice and said unto them you men of
[1:03:04] Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem be
[1:03:07] this known unto you and hearken to my
[1:03:09] words for those for these are not
[1:03:11] drunken as you suppose seeing it is
[1:03:15] about the third hour of the day
[1:03:17] third hour of the day I believe the day
[1:03:19] starts at Sunrise third hour of the day
[1:03:21] is probably about nine o'clock
[1:03:24] so it's nine in the morning and and
[1:03:27] Peter's like no they're not drunk
[1:03:30] but this is that
[1:03:33] which was spoken by the prophet Joel
[1:03:38] Joel 2 28 says this
[1:03:40] and it shall come to pass
[1:03:43] afterward
[1:03:46] that I will pour out my spirit upon All
[1:03:48] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[1:03:51] shall prophesy your old men shall dream
[1:03:53] dreams and your young men shall see
[1:03:56] Visions notice
[1:03:57] that it says afterward now this next
[1:04:01] verse verse 17 in the book of Acts
[1:04:05] Peter is quoting Joel and he says these
[1:04:09] people aren't drunk as you're thinking
[1:04:12] but this is that which was spoken of by
[1:04:15] the prophet Joel and then Peter quotes
[1:04:17] him now notice how Peter says this and
[1:04:20] this was confusing to me
[1:04:22] and it shall come to pass in the last
[1:04:26] days
[1:04:28] saith God
[1:04:32] Joel said it shall come to pass
[1:04:34] afterward
[1:04:36] Peter says and it shall come quoting
[1:04:39] Joel says it shall come to pass in the
[1:04:40] last day saith God I will pour out
[1:04:43] of my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:04:46] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:04:48] and your young men shall see visions and
[1:04:51] your old men shall dream dreams and I
[1:04:54] was I was looking at this and
[1:04:57] I said Lord I don't understand that it
[1:05:00] says in the last days but this was 2 000
[1:05:02] years ago
[1:05:03] that this happened
[1:05:05] how can that be
[1:05:08] and
[1:05:10] thinking about
[1:05:12] these things and and thinking about how
[1:05:15] that this second coming of Christ
[1:05:20] it's talked about as we know in the Book
[1:05:24] of Revelation chapter 8.
[1:05:27] the seventh seal
[1:05:30] and it says something very simple we go
[1:05:33] through our first six seals in chapter
[1:05:35] six chapter seven talks about the 144
[1:05:39] 000 and then chapter eight it says
[1:05:42] and the seventh seal
[1:05:46] sounded
[1:05:47] and there was silence
[1:05:49] in heaven for the space of a half an
[1:05:51] hour
[1:05:52] a very mysterious a very secretive thing
[1:05:58] we know that this seventh seal
[1:06:02] is the coming
[1:06:04] of the Lord
[1:06:06] but yet it had to be so Secret
[1:06:10] so Satan could it and couldn't get in
[1:06:12] there and cause problems that he didn't
[1:06:14] give any time he just said there was
[1:06:17] silence in the space in in heaven for
[1:06:19] the space of a half an hour
[1:06:22] no one knows
[1:06:25] when Christ had returned even Jesus
[1:06:27] himself said that he doesn't know only
[1:06:30] the father knows
[1:06:33] so when we are making ready for this
[1:06:36] second coming and it
[1:06:38] and what I what I got here
[1:06:41] is when it says when it says that
[1:06:47] in the last days
[1:06:50] it's really just anything after the
[1:06:54] resurrection of Christ
[1:06:56] now if you read if you read in the
[1:06:59] Epistles especially in Peter you see
[1:07:01] that that these disciples they thought
[1:07:02] that it was going to be tomorrow
[1:07:05] and they were always making ready
[1:07:08] and it's like that by Design
[1:07:11] so when the people they're always
[1:07:13] looking for the Lord to come and he
[1:07:15] always wants us to be ready and making
[1:07:17] provisions and constantly thinking Lord
[1:07:19] are you coming today because he loves us
[1:07:22] he wants us to be ready because our time
[1:07:25] for the Lord coming may be tonight
[1:07:30] it may be on our way home
[1:07:33] it doesn't necessarily have to be the
[1:07:36] rapture
[1:07:38] it doesn't necessarily have to be as as
[1:07:40] in the as Luke said that these angels
[1:07:44] said that he's going to come in the same
[1:07:46] way that he went up he's going to come
[1:07:48] down and the world's going to see him it
[1:07:51] may not be in that way it may be that we
[1:07:54] die tonight
[1:07:56] that our Earthly life ends
[1:08:00] and that's the way that the Bible the
[1:08:03] New Testament is written is always be
[1:08:05] ready because no one knows when he is
[1:08:07] coming we can see the signs if I said as
[1:08:11] I said before that
[1:08:13] that in the last days perilous times
[1:08:16] shall come
[1:08:17] that that we're going to see that these
[1:08:20] signs start to happen and we're going to
[1:08:22] know that we're in the last days but he
[1:08:24] doesn't tell us when it's protected it's
[1:08:27] protected for our own good because if we
[1:08:29] say it's going to be next year we as
[1:08:32] humans might say well I don't have to
[1:08:33] get ready
[1:08:35] if we say it's going to be in 365 days
[1:08:37] well I'll wait till 364 days you might
[1:08:40] die between then and now
[1:08:43] we don't know when our time is called we
[1:08:46] don't know when when the Lord's going to
[1:08:48] take us so we need to be always ready
[1:08:52] for when he comes
[1:08:55] and that's why it says in the last days
[1:08:57] it's anything after the coming of Christ
[1:09:00] it's anything after this Holy Spirit
[1:09:02] Falls always be ready
[1:09:05] and that's why it says in the last days
[1:09:08] and that's why that it could be
[1:09:10] fulfilled there at the day of Pentecost
[1:09:12] when Peter says that this is going to
[1:09:14] happen in the last days
[1:09:15] because no one knows
[1:09:19] verse number 18.
[1:09:23] and on my servants and on my handmaids I
[1:09:27] will pour out in those days of my spirit
[1:09:29] and they shall prophesy remember the
[1:09:32] author here Luke
[1:09:33] and I I pointed out last last time that
[1:09:36] it was important to Luke to mention the
[1:09:39] sisters
[1:09:41] notice he says that on my servants
[1:09:45] and on my hands mates on the brothers
[1:09:47] and the sisters I will pour out in those
[1:09:49] days of my spirit and they shall
[1:09:52] prophesy
[1:09:55] and I will show wonders in heaven
[1:09:58] and signs in the earth beneath blood and
[1:10:00] fire and Vapor of smoke
[1:10:02] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[1:10:05] and the moon and the blood before the
[1:10:07] great and notable day of the Lord come
[1:10:10] this is referencing the second coming of
[1:10:12] Christ
[1:10:14] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:10:17] shall call in the name of the Lord shall
[1:10:18] be saved
[1:10:20] what is the name of the Lord
[1:10:23] when the thief was on the cross
[1:10:26] there was there was two men
[1:10:28] when the thief was on the cross he had
[1:10:31] not been baptized
[1:10:33] he he didn't have he had done nothing
[1:10:36] but sin his whole life
[1:10:38] but yet he was there and he called Upon
[1:10:41] Jesus
[1:10:42] and Jesus says this day you'll be with
[1:10:45] me in Paradise
[1:10:47] I want to be in the same place that that
[1:10:49] Thief was
[1:10:51] I want to be with Christ
[1:10:54] and
[1:10:56] that is why it says here that you have
[1:11:00] to call upon the name of of the Lord to
[1:11:03] be saved
[1:11:04] ye men of Israel
[1:11:06] hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man
[1:11:09] approved of God among you by Miracles
[1:11:11] and wonders and signs which God did by
[1:11:14] him in the midst of you as ye yourselves
[1:11:16] also know
[1:11:19] now look at the proof that Peter gives
[1:11:23] for Christ
[1:11:25] why is it so important to us
[1:11:30] that we have miracles
[1:11:33] if these miracles
[1:11:35] and
[1:11:38] want to be careful but if these Miracles
[1:11:40] are not following us
[1:11:45] then there's something wrong
[1:11:49] Jesus said that these these signs shall
[1:11:51] follow them that believe
[1:11:55] and Peter here is saying that he's the
[1:11:58] Christ look look what's happened look at
[1:12:00] all the Miracles that he did not just
[1:12:03] one miracle
[1:12:04] but Miracle after Miracle after miracle
[1:12:10] him Jesus
[1:12:12] being delivered by the determinate
[1:12:14] Council and the foreknowledge of God
[1:12:17] ye have taken and by Wicked hands have
[1:12:21] crucified and slain
[1:12:23] now remember this is the first
[1:12:26] sermon
[1:12:27] ever preached
[1:12:29] by a Holy Spirit-filled Christian
[1:12:34] him being delivered by the determinant
[1:12:36] Peter's saying this him being being
[1:12:38] delivered by the determinant Council and
[1:12:39] foreknowledge of God you have taken and
[1:12:41] by Wicked hands have crucified and slain
[1:12:44] whom God hath raised up having loosed
[1:12:47] the Pains of death
[1:12:49] because it was not possible that he
[1:12:51] should beholden of it
[1:12:55] second sign
[1:12:57] here is the resurrection
[1:13:00] the first sign that Peter mentions is
[1:13:03] Miracles but he's what Peter is doing
[1:13:06] here is he's separating Jesus
[1:13:10] from the prophets and everyone else
[1:13:13] there was Miracle after Miracle after
[1:13:15] miracle in the Bible
[1:13:17] from from day one he's a supernatural
[1:13:20] God all the way
[1:13:22] to Jesus we see miracles
[1:13:26] but we do not see a man
[1:13:30] that could die and raise himself back up
[1:13:35] until we saw Jesus so here you give
[1:13:37] Peter gives two he gives two examples
[1:13:41] and it's an it's
[1:13:43] it's a perfect
[1:13:45] example
[1:13:47] of the godhead let me let me read that
[1:13:49] number 24 again whom God has raised up
[1:13:52] so he's talking about Jesus when he had
[1:13:54] died
[1:13:56] and Peter says who God has raised up but
[1:14:00] Jesus himself said I Lay My Life down
[1:14:03] and I can take it back up again
[1:14:06] so how could Peter say well God raised
[1:14:10] him up and then Jesus himself so I
[1:14:12] raised myself up whether the same person
[1:14:16] it's an easy the equation is one plus
[1:14:18] one equals two
[1:14:20] he is God
[1:14:23] it's the same person
[1:14:26] and then Peter continues on here he says
[1:14:28] for David's David speaketh concerning
[1:14:31] him
[1:14:31] I foresaw the lord always before my face
[1:14:34] for he is on my right hand that I should
[1:14:37] not be moved he's quoting a psalm
[1:14:40] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[1:14:42] tongue was glad moreover also my flesh
[1:14:44] shall Rest In Hope
[1:14:46] because thou Wilt not leave my soul in
[1:14:49] Hell neither will thy suffer thy Holy
[1:14:51] Holy One to see corruption again he's
[1:14:54] quoting psalm 16.
[1:14:55] written by David
[1:15:00] thou Hast made known to me the ways of
[1:15:03] life
[1:15:04] thou shall make me full of joy with thy
[1:15:07] countenance
[1:15:08] now now Peter he's quoting the psalm
[1:15:10] there now he starts to preach he says
[1:15:12] men and brethren
[1:15:13] let me freely speak unto you of the
[1:15:16] patriarch David that he is both dead and
[1:15:18] buried in his Sepulcher which is his
[1:15:21] grave his Sepulcher is with us unto this
[1:15:23] day therefore being a prophet and
[1:15:25] knowing that God had sworn with an oath
[1:15:27] that the fruit of his loins according to
[1:15:30] the flesh he would raise up Christ to
[1:15:32] sit on the throne
[1:15:35] he's seeing this before spake of the
[1:15:37] resurrection of Christ that his soul was
[1:15:40] not left in hell neither his flesh did
[1:15:44] see corruption David was one of the
[1:15:47] greatest men That Ever Walked the Earth
[1:15:51] but yet even he being a king and a
[1:15:53] prophet could not raise himself from the
[1:15:55] dead
[1:15:59] this Jesus
[1:16:01] Peter continues this Jesus hath God
[1:16:04] raised up whereof we are all Witnesses
[1:16:09] therefore being by the right hand of God
[1:16:12] exalted and having received of the
[1:16:14] Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he
[1:16:16] has shed forth this
[1:16:19] which ye now see and hear
[1:16:22] for David is not ascended into the
[1:16:24] heavens but he saith himself the Lord
[1:16:27] saith unto my Lord sit thou on my right
[1:16:30] hand until I make thy foes thy footstool
[1:16:32] quoting another Psalm psalm 110.
[1:16:36] therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:16:38] know assuredly that God has made the
[1:16:42] same Jesus who you crucified both Lord
[1:16:46] and Christ
[1:16:50] this Messiah that was to come was not
[1:16:52] only a king
[1:16:54] but he was also God himself as I said
[1:16:56] before now I was a mouthful to a bunch
[1:16:58] of Jews
[1:17:00] that was a big deal what he was saying
[1:17:02] they had just crucified Jesus for saying
[1:17:06] the same thing and now here is Peter
[1:17:08] with the same spirit that Jesus had
[1:17:11] remember before he ran away
[1:17:14] Jesus stood strong
[1:17:17] and they said are you the king of Israel
[1:17:19] he says will you say that I am
[1:17:22] and here is is Jesus he stood Brave as
[1:17:26] you could be and now and Peter runs away
[1:17:29] and forsakes the Lord
[1:17:31] forsakes him three times even cusses so
[1:17:35] people will think that he's not part of
[1:17:37] Jesus
[1:17:38] and here is this same man
[1:17:41] walking up before all these Jews and
[1:17:46] preaching us boldly as the Lord Jesus
[1:17:48] preached
[1:17:51] I love this part
[1:17:53] look at the difference in what happened
[1:17:56] here
[1:17:57] versus what happened when Jesus was
[1:18:00] crucified
[1:18:02] now when they heard this
[1:18:05] they were pricked in their heart
[1:18:08] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[1:18:10] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[1:18:12] we do
[1:18:13] how many times
[1:18:15] have we seen people
[1:18:18] young people old people how many times
[1:18:22] have we seen people the Lord
[1:18:25] works on their hearts
[1:18:28] and they've lived a sinful life
[1:18:31] and then something happens inside of
[1:18:34] them
[1:18:35] where they feel bad
[1:18:37] they start feeling bad for what they've
[1:18:39] done
[1:18:41] and and I've been through it I think
[1:18:43] we've all been through it you know when
[1:18:45] I was when I was your all's age young
[1:18:47] lady's age is when the Lord was really
[1:18:49] dealing with me
[1:18:50] when I was about 20 years old
[1:18:52] and how I just started feeling bad for
[1:18:55] what I was doing
[1:18:57] and and I came to the place I said Lord
[1:18:59] I I don't want this anymore
[1:19:02] I need something different and that's
[1:19:05] the same feeling that these people had
[1:19:07] they were like wow this is this is real
[1:19:09] this is real this man did Miracles this
[1:19:13] man did all of this and they crucified
[1:19:14] him and he rose from the dead just like
[1:19:16] Peter was saying and Peter was there and
[1:19:19] all these people were there and there's
[1:19:20] 120 of them and they're speaking in
[1:19:22] different languages and they're doing
[1:19:24] all these Miracles like whoa this is
[1:19:26] real I'm a sinner
[1:19:29] Peter I need what you have
[1:19:33] and then that sweetness
[1:19:36] of a tender heart says this
[1:19:42] it says
[1:19:45] I'll read it again now when they heard
[1:19:47] this they were pricked in their heart
[1:19:48] and said to Peter
[1:19:50] and to the rest of the Apostles
[1:19:52] men and brethren
[1:19:54] what shall we do
[1:19:57] I feel bad
[1:19:59] I've messed up in my life
[1:20:01] now what do I need to do because I want
[1:20:05] to be forgiven
[1:20:07] I want that relationship that you have
[1:20:10] Peter
[1:20:11] and Peter said these words and all of us
[1:20:14] can probably quote them
[1:20:16] Peter said unto them repent
[1:20:20] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:20:22] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:20:25] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[1:20:29] the Holy Ghost
[1:20:30] you will receive the same thing that I
[1:20:34] got
[1:20:35] now notice with baptism
[1:20:38] the first thing that comes is repentance
[1:20:42] I feel bad for what I've done
[1:20:45] and I need to make it right
[1:20:48] I Repent I'm sorry
[1:20:52] and then
[1:20:53] you go to baptism
[1:20:56] now remission
[1:20:57] doesn't it doesn't mean
[1:21:00] that your sins can be remitted I've
[1:21:03] heard
[1:21:04] some ministers preach that that
[1:21:07] when you're baptized when you go down
[1:21:10] under the water and you come back up
[1:21:11] then that's when your sins are forgiven
[1:21:13] that can't be
[1:21:15] your sins were forgiven when Jesus died
[1:21:18] on the cross
[1:21:20] two thousand years ago that is when the
[1:21:23] atonement was made but now you are
[1:21:26] making an outward expression of what the
[1:21:30] Lord is doing inside of you that is what
[1:21:33] baptism is
[1:21:35] he died once for our sins
[1:21:38] he didn't have to go do it again that
[1:21:40] happened two thousand years ago and our
[1:21:43] sins were remitted there but we have to
[1:21:46] accept that and Peter says be baptized
[1:21:49] for the remission of your essential
[1:21:51] remission means it says taken away
[1:21:54] forgiveness of your sins they're gone
[1:21:58] they are completely wiped out through
[1:22:01] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] for this and Peter continues for the
[1:22:07] promise is unto you
[1:22:09] and to your children and to all that are
[1:22:12] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:22:14] shall call
[1:22:16] that means us
[1:22:19] that's 2 000 years three thousand
[1:22:22] however long time goes on
[1:22:26] is how long that promise lasts
[1:22:31] and with many other words did he testify
[1:22:33] and exhort saying save yourself from
[1:22:36] this untoward generation
[1:22:38] that word is crooked
[1:22:41] corrupt
[1:22:42] save yourself from this corrupt
[1:22:44] generation and they that gladly received
[1:22:47] his word were baptized and the same day
[1:22:49] that were added unto them about three
[1:22:51] thousand Souls
[1:22:54] let me tell you something you get the
[1:22:56] Holy Ghost and you start presenting that
[1:22:58] and these things start happening you
[1:23:01] watch people start coming
[1:23:04] because they're going to see I see
[1:23:06] something in this person that I want I
[1:23:09] see a love that they have I see I see a
[1:23:13] doctrine that they have I see that they
[1:23:15] have Miracles that follow them
[1:23:18] and they continued steadfastly in the
[1:23:21] apostles doctrines and fellowship and
[1:23:23] breaking of bread and in prayers
[1:23:25] now look at the four things that the
[1:23:28] writer here writes Luke writes
[1:23:30] the apostles Doctrine
[1:23:33] they continuing in the apostles Doctrine
[1:23:35] which is the doctrine of Christ this
[1:23:37] wasn't a lukewarm feel good
[1:23:39] religion
[1:23:41] this is the apostles Doctrine
[1:23:44] Paul comes a little bit later but he was
[1:23:46] an apostle these are things they
[1:23:48] preached against lying
[1:23:51] they preached against gossiping
[1:23:55] I could I could go on for for a long
[1:23:58] time just for those two things
[1:24:00] just in the New Testament
[1:24:03] they preached against adultery they
[1:24:06] preached against divorce they preached
[1:24:07] against laziness
[1:24:10] they preached against not doing anything
[1:24:13] they preached against these things they
[1:24:15] continued in these doctrines
[1:24:19] and
[1:24:21] Fellowship
[1:24:24] the big move today is to stay home from
[1:24:28] church just
[1:24:30] streaming just get on YouTube and find
[1:24:33] your favorite preacher and and go there
[1:24:36] or stay home and just listen to the
[1:24:38] sermons from home just listen to your
[1:24:40] tapes at home that is absolutely against
[1:24:43] what their this is saying here in Acts
[1:24:46] chapter 2.
[1:24:49] it's wrong
[1:24:55] if
[1:24:57] brother Lyle how can I fellowship with
[1:24:59] you if I never see you
[1:25:01] I guess we could do on teams and and on
[1:25:05] on Zoom or whatever
[1:25:08] no I mean it might might be okay but if
[1:25:13] I never see you I don't know you
[1:25:17] and it's the same with us it's then it's
[1:25:19] not just with church it's outside of
[1:25:21] church we should love to be together
[1:25:25] it's Fellowship
[1:25:27] that's two things he mentions here
[1:25:29] and then come an income breaking of
[1:25:31] bread which is the communion
[1:25:34] we don't neglect communion I've told you
[1:25:38] before one of the most common questions
[1:25:39] that I got when I was in the ministry in
[1:25:41] Jeffersonville is can I take communion
[1:25:43] at home
[1:25:45] and what was my answer why
[1:25:48] and it was always that I didn't see
[1:25:51] things like this group of people
[1:25:53] they didn't believe things like I
[1:25:55] believe
[1:25:57] constantly asking that question
[1:26:01] and I I respond
[1:26:05] saying well do they believe Jesus well
[1:26:08] yeah
[1:26:09] well do they believe in communion well
[1:26:12] yeah well what do you what was wrong
[1:26:15] you want to separate yourself from those
[1:26:18] people because maybe you don't see the
[1:26:20] seventh seal the same
[1:26:21] maybe because you don't see dressed the
[1:26:24] same so you're gonna separate yourself
[1:26:26] from those people and break exactly what
[1:26:29] is written here in Acts chapter 2.
[1:26:33] and then the next thing is prayer
[1:26:39] they continued steadfastly in the
[1:26:41] apostles Doctrine and fellowship and
[1:26:42] breaking bread and in prayers
[1:26:46] and this is where
[1:26:48] I think
[1:26:49] the church may fall the most short
[1:26:54] I know it's something that
[1:26:57] me I look at myself and I said Lord I
[1:27:00] need to spend more time with you
[1:27:03] can you imagine getting on your knees
[1:27:08] and talking with the one that created
[1:27:11] the heavens and the Earth
[1:27:14] millions of angels are surrounding him
[1:27:17] the ones that are closest to him can't
[1:27:19] even they can't even show their face or
[1:27:21] their feet
[1:27:22] because his presence is so holy and I
[1:27:25] can get on my knees and I can commune
[1:27:28] with that
[1:27:29] being
[1:27:31] and I have something else to do
[1:27:35] I'm too tired
[1:27:37] you know why I'm too tired because I
[1:27:39] make myself too tired you know why I
[1:27:41] have something else to do because I
[1:27:42] spend too much time watching YouTube on
[1:27:44] my iPad
[1:27:47] because I waste too much time and I
[1:27:49] could be there talking communing with
[1:27:53] that one in prayer
[1:27:56] I look at these Servants of the Lord in
[1:27:58] the Bible I look at Peter he was up on
[1:28:01] the housetop in prayer
[1:28:04] and God gave him a vision to go to the
[1:28:06] Gentiles
[1:28:08] I was I look at the Lord Jesus himself
[1:28:12] the Bible says he prayed all night
[1:28:15] before he chose those 12 disciples
[1:28:18] before he made that decision
[1:28:20] that's the Son of God and how much time
[1:28:22] do I spend
[1:28:23] with the Lord
[1:28:27] and fear
[1:28:29] Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders
[1:28:31] and signs were done by the apostles
[1:28:34] remember there's a difference as I said
[1:28:36] in chapter 1 between Apostles and
[1:28:38] disciples
[1:28:40] we should be making disciples to Jesus
[1:28:42] those that believe Jesus those that sin
[1:28:45] under Jesus's Ministry
[1:28:48] but when you become an apostle you have
[1:28:51] a mission
[1:28:52] you're sent forth
[1:28:57] and all that believed were together and
[1:28:58] had all things in common they sold their
[1:29:01] possessions and goods and parted them to
[1:29:03] all men
[1:29:05] as every man had need look at how close
[1:29:08] this Fellowship was look at how
[1:29:10] beautiful this was and how much these
[1:29:13] people loved each other
[1:29:16] if they had a big house
[1:29:18] brother Lyle they had Friday
[1:29:21] young people's fellowship with a taco
[1:29:24] bar
[1:29:25] and a bonfire and ice cream afterwards
[1:29:30] if they had a little bit of extra time
[1:29:33] brother Merle they went up and put
[1:29:35] together
[1:29:36] furniture
[1:29:38] all day long
[1:29:40] for two days
[1:29:42] for the young people
[1:29:44] they took what they had and they put it
[1:29:48] to work for the gospel they had land and
[1:29:52] they sold it they wanted to see it go
[1:29:54] forth they had they took what they had
[1:29:57] and they put it to work these aren't a
[1:29:59] bunch of socialists and Communists where
[1:30:03] they take everything and they give it to
[1:30:04] the pastor
[1:30:06] and then he says okay well I'll give you
[1:30:07] some and you some no that's not what
[1:30:09] this is talking about they took what
[1:30:11] they had and they put it to work
[1:30:15] and that's what we should be doing
[1:30:16] everything and I see a little bit of it
[1:30:18] but it needs to be more
[1:30:21] if you have time put it to work for the
[1:30:23] Lord
[1:30:25] and they continued daily with one Accord
[1:30:28] in the temple
[1:30:30] and breaking bread from house to house
[1:30:32] did eat their meat with gladness and
[1:30:35] singleness of heart
[1:30:37] wrapping it up the musicians can come
[1:30:40] forward please
[1:30:46] and they continued let me read that
[1:30:48] again and they continued daily with one
[1:30:49] Accord in the temple and breaking bread
[1:30:52] from house to house did eat their meat
[1:30:55] with gladness and singleness of heart
[1:30:59] I had a Minister's meeting
[1:31:02] but while you were there I think you
[1:31:04] were there when I when I spoke at the
[1:31:05] one of the first ministers meetings in
[1:31:07] Arizona
[1:31:09] the question
[1:31:11] was
[1:31:13] how do we all get in one Accord as they
[1:31:17] were in the book of Acts
[1:31:21] and you'll notice that they were in one
[1:31:23] Accord because they had one purpose
[1:31:27] and that purpose was to spread the
[1:31:29] gospel
[1:31:30] we can never be in agreement we can
[1:31:33] never be in unity we can never get along
[1:31:36] unless we all have the same purpose in
[1:31:40] life
[1:31:41] and if our purpose in life is constantly
[1:31:44] serving ourselves
[1:31:46] I'm just working towards retirement I'm
[1:31:49] just I I'm just working towards having
[1:31:52] this job and and and and making my way
[1:31:56] in this world those things are good but
[1:31:59] our purpose if we want to be in complete
[1:32:02] Unity as they were in this book
[1:32:04] we have to have one purpose and that
[1:32:07] purpose is Christ
[1:32:08] now purpose is serving Christ and that
[1:32:11] purpose is the same as it is here
[1:32:13] getting people to him
[1:32:16] you'll see you see in the the war in
[1:32:19] Ukraine
[1:32:20] and how
[1:32:21] Ukraine is just given Russia the hardest
[1:32:25] time
[1:32:26] and there had been for the past year
[1:32:29] Russia's got weapons
[1:32:31] they've got everything that they need to
[1:32:34] beat this country but this country has
[1:32:37] come together in one Accord to fight for
[1:32:41] their own land
[1:32:43] and they're gonna fight till they die
[1:32:46] and that is why that they are being
[1:32:49] successful
[1:32:50] is because they have one Mission and
[1:32:53] that's to save their home
[1:32:57] and if we could have that and push like
[1:33:01] these disciples did in Acts chapter 2.
[1:33:05] that is where Unity will come from we
[1:33:08] always think that there's going to be a
[1:33:09] white magic wand waved and all of a
[1:33:12] sudden we're all going to love each
[1:33:13] other that's not going to happen
[1:33:16] what needs to happen is that we get our
[1:33:18] minds focused on one thing and that is
[1:33:23] Jesus Christ not on our doctrines that
[1:33:26] separate us
[1:33:28] but on Christ that died for us
[1:33:32] and getting other people
[1:33:34] to our Lord
[1:33:36] I had an experience after you all left
[1:33:38] on um I'll tell it on Sunday that I
[1:33:41] really believe it was from the Lord
[1:33:44] I was thinking about our visitors here
[1:33:46] and I was I was just I was just feeling
[1:33:48] good and Daniel and I we um we walked in
[1:33:52] here it was late at night
[1:33:55] and we walked in we were turning off the
[1:33:58] lights in the church last night
[1:34:01] and we walked in
[1:34:03] we came in the back door right over
[1:34:05] where brother Arnie is the door where
[1:34:07] everybody came in
[1:34:08] and the lights
[1:34:10] were just on the platform
[1:34:13] and
[1:34:15] I'll tell you what buddy I was
[1:34:17] overwhelmed
[1:34:19] the Beauty and the reverence
[1:34:23] and the presence that was here
[1:34:26] the lights off and just
[1:34:29] just the light
[1:34:31] with this here in this pulpit and what
[1:34:35] it meant
[1:34:37] and to think how many people have come
[1:34:39] to this altar
[1:34:40] and giving giving their hearts to the
[1:34:43] Lord and and have gone on to be with the
[1:34:45] Lord now
[1:34:46] uh
[1:34:48] I was overwhelmed when I was looking at
[1:34:50] it and I had to go get Daniel I said
[1:34:52] buddy I want to show you something I
[1:34:54] went we came in and we came back in the
[1:34:56] back and and he looked and I was like
[1:34:58] wow
[1:35:00] there is something special
[1:35:04] there's something special about this
[1:35:07] and if we could just get our minds
[1:35:11] on Christ
[1:35:13] if we can just get our minds on the one
[1:35:15] that died on this cross as they did here
[1:35:19] in the book of Acts then I believe that
[1:35:23] we would see the same results
[1:35:26] as they received here
[1:35:29] and I'm looking forward to learning more
[1:35:31] about this book and and seeing these
[1:35:34] manifestations
[1:35:36] verse number 7 47.
[1:35:42] praising God
[1:35:44] and having favor with all the people
[1:35:48] and the Lord added to the church daily
[1:35:53] such as should be saved
[1:35:58] I'm not
[1:36:00] satisfied
[1:36:02] I'll never be satisfied with my life
[1:36:06] we could fill this place up and have a
[1:36:08] thousand people I'll never be satisfied
[1:36:10] until that one person that's out on the
[1:36:14] street that is a sinner comes in
[1:36:16] and then maybe another one and maybe
[1:36:19] another one
[1:36:20] we should never be satisfied with
[1:36:22] anything that's accomplished
[1:36:25] we should never neglect
[1:36:28] reaching out
[1:36:30] as they did here they had a mission
[1:36:34] two thousand years later we have the
[1:36:36] same Mission not to introduce people to
[1:36:39] how we believe brother Jonathan
[1:36:41] but to introduce people to a living
[1:36:44] Jesus Christ
[1:36:46] that is our goal and that's what this
[1:36:49] book is about
[1:36:50] I'm looking forward to hearing more
[1:36:52] let's stand
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:57] God bless you all
[1:37:00] let's bow our heads
[1:37:09] Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:37:12] we thank you that you preserve this book
[1:37:15] called the book of Acts
[1:37:18] and Lord we as we read through this we
[1:37:21] want to maybe find ourselves in this
[1:37:23] book
[1:37:25] do everything we can
[1:37:28] just to make life a little bit better
[1:37:30] for someone
[1:37:32] Lord and
[1:37:33] if we could use any any skill that
[1:37:37] you've given us
[1:37:39] as the disciples said had they had all
[1:37:43] things in common
[1:37:45] and Lord if it's opening up our homes
[1:37:50] if it's reaching out a helping hand
[1:37:55] if it's preaching the gospel if it's
[1:37:57] witnessing if it's praying for the sick
[1:37:59] whatever it is Lord let's let us use
[1:38:02] whatever we have to further your kingdom
[1:38:06] I believe that's the spirit of this book
[1:38:09] and father may we get into that same
[1:38:11] spirit
[1:38:13] we love you Lord in Jesus name
[1:38:15] amen
