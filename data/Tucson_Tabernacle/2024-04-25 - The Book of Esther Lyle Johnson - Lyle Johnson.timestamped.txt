[32:47] good to see you Heather and I were out
[32:48] on the East Coast for the last few days
[32:50] and just got back sometime after
[32:52] midnight last night and we're really
[32:55] glad to be back not just to be back in
[32:58] Tucson to be back with you we missed you
[33:02] this last weekend and glad to see you
[33:04] glad to see you I have to tell you that
[33:08] I'm almost overcome by the timing of
[33:11] tonight's lesson we have just begun the
[33:14] observance of
[33:16] Passover it's a time to ensure that
[33:18] there's no leaven in our lives and to
[33:22] remember that we were once slaves to
[33:26] sin we see rest in our nation regarding
[33:29] Israel and Gaza prestigious universities
[33:32] are closing campuses and in effect
[33:36] sending Jewish students home because
[33:38] many campuses have become unsafe for
[33:40] them while leaders ring their hands but
[33:44] make excuses and refuse to confront the
[33:48] problem protesters are allowed to encamp
[33:51] on University grounds while hate mongers
[33:54] crowd the gates chanting hate to Jewish
[33:56] people and to America in an attempt to
[34:00] incite
[34:01] violence against this background in our
[34:04] own Nation tonight we'll look at one of
[34:06] the most unusual books of the Old
[34:08] Testament the Book of Esther it's one of
[34:11] only two books in the Bible where God is
[34:14] not even
[34:16] mentioned yet God's hand is apparent
[34:20] throughout and it deals with anti-jewish
[34:24] hatred and violence as we see today it's
[34:28] also the last book that was canonized
[34:31] accepted his Holy scripture in the Old
[34:33] Testament in the Jewish Bible in the
[34:35] Tanakh sometime around 400
[34:38] BC a holiday called puim is celebrated
[34:42] in
[34:43] Judaism it's not one of the ones listed
[34:45] by Moses but rather it's observed as a
[34:48] celebration of Esther's Victory on
[34:51] behalf of the Jewish people unlike for
[34:55] example Joon of Arc Esther was not a
[34:58] warrior she was the Persian Empire
[35:01] equivalent of Miss Universe or Miss
[35:04] America Esther was an amazingly
[35:06] courageous woman putting her life on the
[35:09] line to protect her people from a
[35:11] vicious and Powerful Foe and the book
[35:14] tells her story It's the final book of
[35:17] the biblical histories of the Jewish
[35:20] people before we dig into its story of
[35:23] Courage of hopelessness versus hope of
[35:26] condemnation and rest
[35:28] restoration let's turn to its author who
[35:30] chose to hide himself within its
[35:34] Pages Lord Jesus we are so in awe of you
[35:38] we are so grateful as we sang you're
[35:41] more than enough Lord that that that
[35:44] sentence Jehovah sha means god you're
[35:46] you're there not here but there so we
[35:49] have to see you in each other to find
[35:52] you Lord we just pray Lord that you'd be
[35:55] very present tonight we thank you
[35:56] because we know that you you are present
[35:58] tonight Lord I pray that you would
[36:00] forgive me Lord of my shortcomings my
[36:04] faults Lord just people have come not to
[36:08] hear what Lyall Johnson has to say no
[36:10] one should care what Lyall Johnson has
[36:12] to say people are here to hear from you
[36:17] speak to us through your word tonight we
[36:19] ask in Jesus precious name
[36:23] amen we'll start our lesson with two
[36:26] verses the first is from the Gospel of
[36:30] John chapter 10 Jesus is speaking he's
[36:34] teaching his disciples about his mission
[36:36] as the Good Shepherd he says the thief
[36:40] who's the thief who does that represent
[36:42] What Spirit the thief cometh not but for
[36:46] to steal and to kill and to destroy but
[36:51] I am come that they who does the Good
[36:54] Shepherd protect that they might have
[36:57] life
[36:58] and that they might have it more
[37:01] abundantly the second opening verse
[37:03] helping to set our context is the 30th
[37:06] verse from Proverbs chapter
[37:12] 31 charm is
[37:14] deceitful beauty is passing but a woman
[37:19] who fears the Lord she shall be
[37:23] praised please be seated
[37:27] the Bible is a book that is full of
[37:30] contrasts from its Pages we read of
[37:32] heroes and villains those who do good
[37:36] and those who do evil obedience and
[37:40] Disobedience and always imperfect people
[37:44] just like me we're encouraged to follow
[37:47] the lord and partake of his goodness and
[37:50] his grace all the while being admonished
[37:54] that there are consequences if we stray
[37:58] the Book of Esther is a study and
[38:02] contrasts it is said in shushan also
[38:05] called Susa which contained The Winter
[38:07] Palace of the Persian Empire dasas whom
[38:10] we heard about in the study of Ezra
[38:12] ruled from there but where is
[38:17] Susa well let's start with the world we
[38:19] know I've marked Tucson with a star and
[38:22] Jerusalem with the Magan deid the
[38:24] six-pointed Star of David now we're
[38:26] going to zoom into the area within the
[38:29] red rectangle and replace the modern
[38:31] names which you can't read anyway
[38:32] because it's too small with those of the
[38:35] context of the Book of
[38:37] Esther so there's a map of the Persian
[38:39] Empire here I marked Jerusalem as before
[38:42] and I've circled the location of Susa in
[38:45] today's world it's near the border of
[38:47] Iraq and Iran east of ancient Babylon
[38:52] the palace or Fortress or Citadel at
[38:55] Susa is the setting of the book
[38:58] as you can see on the map the empire was
[39:00] vast from the western edge of what we
[39:03] know is India through turkey much of the
[39:06] Black Sea area along the Eastern porch
[39:09] of North Africa and down to modern day
[39:10] Sudan called Ethiopia in the
[39:13] text under dasas whom we heard about in
[39:17] Ezra and Nehemiah Egypt was conquered
[39:21] and you might not know it but a canal
[39:23] was dug to allow shipping from the Nile
[39:26] to the red c a precursor to the Suez
[39:29] Canal of our time this occurred in 510
[39:33] BC some 2400 years before the the
[39:38] digging of the Suz Canal As We Know It
[39:40] This is a powerful
[39:44] Kingdom the story of Esther takes place
[39:47] under an unnamed Persian king he's he's
[39:50] called a hazus in the biblical text but
[39:53] that's like saying Pharaoh it it is an
[39:56] individual name but it's a title it's
[39:59] uncertain which of the Persian kings
[40:01] this is many believe it was Xerxes
[40:03] others one of the AR Xerxes there are
[40:07] enough details the number of provinces
[40:09] and so forth in the text to make it
[40:12] uncertain some believe the story is
[40:14] fiction because of the discrepancies and
[40:16] details for example it it declares over
[40:19] and over there's 127 provinces secular
[40:22] history says that at its maximum size it
[40:24] was 120 provinces but
[40:28] take take your
[40:29] pick if the King's actual name were
[40:33] important it would probably have been in
[40:35] the text if it were AR Xerxes then
[40:38] Esther would have been chosen Queen
[40:40] about the time Ezra arrived in Jerusalem
[40:42] and still Queen when Nehemiah made his
[40:44] journey we'll go with Xerxes but keep in
[40:46] mind we simply don't know and no brother
[40:50] random didn't say anything about this
[40:51] that I could find either i' I put the
[40:53] name hadasa up there because that's the
[40:55] Hebrew name of Esther
[40:58] it's widely thought that Ezra or perhaps
[41:01] Nehemiah wrote the
[41:03] book well since this is a Bible
[41:05] study I'd like for each adult and young
[41:08] person who's a reader to hold up your
[41:10] Bible for a minute or two just if you
[41:12] don't have one there's one in the Pew
[41:14] there I'd like you just hold it up for a
[41:19] moment some of you need to be quick
[41:21] because others arms are already getting
[41:23] tired so so please continue to hold it
[41:26] up while I read next slide and then
[41:29] you'll be able to put it down it's from
[41:31] the sardian church age brother brandom
[41:33] says now you got the Bible in your
[41:36] hand yeah now read it believe it don't
[41:42] lay it up on the Shelf say well we got a
[41:44] Bible that ain't going to do you no good
[41:46] up there there's too many lutherans in
[41:48] Pentecost today laying the Bible around
[41:50] and taking what somebody else says about
[41:54] it brother read the word word search the
[41:59] scriptures for they are they which
[42:00] testify of me said Jesus in them you
[42:03] think you have eternal life that's the
[42:06] thing to do read that word you can put
[42:09] your Bible down now it's easier to read
[42:11] when it's not held up quite so high this
[42:14] is why we have a Bible study right it's
[42:17] why you need to read it at home not not
[42:20] because I ask you to or brother Daniel
[42:23] ask you to or that brother bradam asked
[42:25] you to Jesus
[42:28] ask you to and by the way he was
[42:31] referring to the Old
[42:34] Testament including the Book of Esther
[42:38] amen we should have a hunger a thirst
[42:41] for the word don't take my word for what
[42:44] it
[42:45] means I know almost nothing and at my
[42:48] age I forgotten most of that sounds like
[42:51] I'm preaching I better get on with the
[42:53] story of Esther
[42:55] uh I
[42:59] I found ancient copies of the Susan
[43:02] Citadel Courier and their archives
[43:04] dealing with the time of
[43:07] Esther this evening I've chosen to use
[43:10] the What's called the nkjv the new King
[43:12] James version translation rather than
[43:14] the King James version it's almost
[43:17] identical the differences are very minor
[43:19] substituting words like you for ye or he
[43:22] said rather than he answered when there
[43:24] was no question asked and so forth and
[43:27] putting speech and quotes it's just a
[43:29] slightly updated uh version but it's
[43:31] still retaining King James if you will
[43:34] you can follow along in your King James
[43:36] version if you like they they'll track
[43:38] just fine we'll read almost the entire
[43:42] text this evening there's there's only
[43:44] 10 chapters we'll
[43:47] read nine and a half of them
[43:50] so let's start
[43:53] reading it's year three of the king's
[43:56] reign the very beginning of it the first
[43:58] month the king's Banquets and queen
[44:00] vas's refusal well the book opens with a
[44:03] big party at the beginning of the third
[44:05] year of the king's Reign now it came to
[44:08] pass in the days of azerus this was the
[44:11] azerus who reigned over 127 provinces
[44:14] from India to Ethiopia so here we see
[44:16] that this hazus is not a unique name of
[44:19] a king or it wouldn't have said this is
[44:21] this particular azerus it would have
[44:23] just not bothered to put in that detail
[44:25] in those days when King azerus sat on
[44:27] the throne of his kingdom which is in
[44:29] shushan the Citadel or or the palace
[44:32] that in the third year of his Reign he
[44:34] made a feast for all of his officials
[44:36] and servants the powers of Persia and
[44:40] media that's media as an area not media
[44:43] like the news the Nobles the princes of
[44:46] the provinces being before him when he
[44:48] showed the riches of his glorious
[44:50] Kingdom and the Splendor of his
[44:52] excellent Majesty for many days 180 days
[44:56] in all 6 months this is a big party and
[44:59] when these days were completed the king
[45:01] made a feast lasting seven days for all
[45:04] the people who were present in shushan
[45:06] the Citadel from great to small in the
[45:08] court of the garden of the king's Palace
[45:11] there were white and blue linen curtains
[45:13] fastened with cords of fine linen and
[45:15] purple on Silver rods and marble pillars
[45:18] and the couches were of gold and silver
[45:20] on a mosaic pavement of alabaster
[45:23] turquoise white and black marble they of
[45:27] drinks and golden vessels each vessel
[45:29] being different from the other with
[45:31] Royal Wine in abundance according to the
[45:33] generosity of the king you get the
[45:36] picture opulence and ostentatious
[45:39] display of
[45:41] wealth in accordance with the law
[45:43] drinking was not compulsory for so the
[45:46] king had ordered all the officers of his
[45:48] household that they should do according
[45:50] to each man's pleasure in other words
[45:52] drink as much as you want Queen vashy
[45:55] also made a feast for the women in the
[45:57] Royal Palace which belonged to King
[46:01] azerus on the seventh day when the heart
[46:05] of the King was Marry with
[46:06] wine he was
[46:09] drunk he
[46:11] commanded muman besta harbona BTA abaka
[46:16] zetar and carcass seven Unix who served
[46:18] as officers or chamberlains who served
[46:21] in the presence of King azus to bring
[46:23] Queen vashy before the king wearing her
[46:26] royal crown around in order to show her
[46:28] beauty to the people and the officials
[46:30] for she was beautiful to
[46:32] behold but Queen vashi refused to come
[46:35] at the King's Command brought by his
[46:37] Unix therefore the King was Furious his
[46:41] anger burned within him then the king
[46:44] said to the wise men who understood the
[46:45] times for this was the king's manner
[46:48] toward all who knew Law And Justice
[46:51] those closest to him being Kena shettar
[46:54] ad Matata tares meis Merena and mukin
[46:58] the Seven princes of Persia and media
[47:02] who had access to the king's presence
[47:04] well we'll see the implication of this
[47:06] access as the story
[47:08] progresses access to the king's present
[47:10] and who ranked highest in the
[47:14] Kingdom what shall we do to Queen vashi
[47:17] according to law because she did not
[47:20] obey the command of King azerus brought
[47:22] to her by the
[47:24] Unix and mukan answer before the king
[47:28] and the princes it's quite the
[47:30] politician is mukin Queen vashy is not
[47:33] only wrong the king but also all the
[47:36] princes and all the people who are in
[47:38] all the provinces of king of azerus for
[47:40] the Queen's Behavior will become known
[47:42] to all women so that they will despise
[47:45] their husbands in their eyes when they
[47:47] report King azerus commanded Queen Vash
[47:50] to be brought him before him she did not
[47:52] come this very day the noble ladies of
[47:56] Persia and media will say to all the
[47:58] king's officials that they have heard of
[48:00] the behavior of the queen thus there
[48:03] will be excessive contempt and wrath if
[48:06] it pleases the king let a Royal Decree
[48:09] go out from him and let it be recorded
[48:11] in the laws of the Persians and the
[48:12] means so that it will not be altered
[48:14] that vashi shall come no more before
[48:17] King azerus and let the King give her
[48:19] royal position to another who is better
[48:22] than
[48:23] she when the king's decree which he
[48:26] shall make is proclaimed throughout all
[48:28] his Empire for it is a great Empire you
[48:31] have there King all wives will honor
[48:33] their husbands both great and
[48:36] small and the reply pleased the king and
[48:40] the princes and the King did according
[48:42] to the word of mukan remember this is
[48:44] year
[48:46] three then he sent letters to all the
[48:48] king's provinces to each province in its
[48:50] own script and to every people in their
[48:52] own language so that each man should be
[48:54] master in his own house and speak and
[48:57] the language of his own
[49:04] people Ashley is dethroned who will
[49:07] replace her who's Esther Esther chos
[49:11] Queen morai discover who's
[49:13] Mori what's what's going on this this is
[49:16] going to take us to the end of year
[49:18] seven almost five years will have
[49:20] transpired by the end of this little
[49:23] section chapter 2 after these things
[49:25] when the wrath of King hazus subsided he
[49:28] remembered vashi what she had done and
[49:31] what had been decreed against her then
[49:33] the king's servants who intended him
[49:37] said uh let beautiful young virgins be
[49:41] sought for the king and let the king
[49:44] appoint officers in all the provinces of
[49:47] his kingdom that they may gather all the
[49:49] beautiful young virgins to sh on the
[49:52] Citadel into the women's quarters under
[49:54] the custody of hega the king's custodian
[49:57] of the women let Beauty preparations be
[50:00] given them then let the young woman who
[50:03] pleases the king be Queen instead of
[50:08] ashy this thing pleased the king and he
[50:11] did
[50:12] so in chushan the Citadel there was a
[50:15] certain Jew whose name was Mori the son
[50:18] of yir the son of shimi the son of Kish
[50:22] a
[50:24] benjaminite Kish had been carried away
[50:26] from Jerusalem now this isn't actually
[50:28] Kish but it's the descendants of Kish
[50:30] not Kish himself from Jerusalem with the
[50:32] captives who have been captured with
[50:34] yonia king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar
[50:37] the king of Babylon had carried away so
[50:38] that was about 597 BC about 11 years
[50:41] before the destruction of the temple and
[50:44] morai had brought up hadassa that is
[50:47] Esther his uncle's daughter for she had
[50:50] neither father nor
[50:53] mother it's his cousin the young woman
[50:57] was lovely and beautiful when her father
[51:00] and mother died morai took her as his
[51:04] own daughter morai is a steady in
[51:07] contrast himself as we'll soon see so it
[51:10] was when the King's Command and decree
[51:12] were heard and when many young women
[51:13] were gathered at shushan the Citadel
[51:15] under the custody of hegi that Esther
[51:19] also was taken to the king's Palace and
[51:21] to the care of hegi the custodian of the
[51:25] women now the young woman pleased him
[51:27] and she obtained his favor so he readily
[51:30] gave Beauty preparations to her in
[51:32] addition to her
[51:34] allowance then seven Choice maid
[51:36] servants were provided for her from the
[51:38] king's Palace and he moved her and her
[51:41] maid servants to the best place in the
[51:43] house of the women Esther had not
[51:46] revealed her people or family for morai
[51:48] had charged her not to reveal it she
[51:51] kept her Jewish Heritage a
[51:54] secret every day Mor die paced in front
[51:57] of the court of the women's quarters to
[51:58] learn of Esther's welfare what was
[52:00] happening to her each young woman's turn
[52:03] came to go into king aazar after she
[52:05] completed 12 months preparation
[52:09] according to the regulations for their
[52:10] women for thus were the days of their
[52:12] preparation a portion six months with
[52:14] oil of myrr and six months with perfumes
[52:16] and preparations for beautifying women
[52:20] thus
[52:21] prepared each young woman went to the
[52:23] king and she was given whatever she
[52:25] desired to take with her from the
[52:27] women's quarters to the king's
[52:30] Palace in the evening she went and in
[52:33] the morning she returned to the second
[52:34] house of the women to the custody of
[52:36] shaaz the king's unic who kept the
[52:39] concubines she would not go to the King
[52:41] again unless the king delighted in her
[52:44] and called her by
[52:47] name now when the ter came for Esther
[52:52] the daughter of abah el the uncle of
[52:55] morai who had taken her as his daughter
[52:59] to go into the king she requested
[53:01] nothing but with hega the king's unic
[53:04] the custodian of the women
[53:07] advised and Esther obtained favor in the
[53:10] sight of all who saw her so Esther was
[53:13] taken to King azerus into his Royal
[53:17] Palace in the 10th month which is a
[53:20] month of tbit January in the seventh
[53:23] year of his Reign this is almost five
[53:25] years after deposed in
[53:27] vashy the king loved Esther more than
[53:30] all the other
[53:31] women and she obtained grace and favor
[53:36] in his
[53:37] sight more than all the virgins so he
[53:41] set the Royal Crown upon her head and
[53:43] made her Queen instead of
[53:46] vashy then the king made a great feast
[53:49] the Feast of Esther for all his
[53:50] officials and servants he proclaimed a
[53:52] holiday from the provinces and gave
[53:54] gifts according to the generosity of a
[53:58] king when virgins were gathered together
[54:00] a second time morai sat within the
[54:02] king's gate this might have been months
[54:03] or years later we really don't know Now
[54:06] esther had not revealed her family and
[54:08] her people just as morai had charged her
[54:10] for Esther obeyed the command of morai
[54:14] as when she was brought up by
[54:16] him in those days while morai sat within
[54:19] the king's gate two of the king's Unix
[54:21] bean and teres doorkeepers became
[54:25] Furious and sought to lay hands on King
[54:28] azerus so the matter became known to
[54:30] Mori who told Queen Esther and Esther
[54:34] informed the king and mori's
[54:38] name when an inquiry was made into the
[54:41] matter it was confirmed and both were
[54:44] hanged on a Gallow and it was written in
[54:46] the book of The Chronicles in the
[54:47] presence of the king it says hanged on a
[54:50] Gallow and we tend to think of uh you
[54:54] know Boot Hill and and all of that sort
[54:57] of thing and you know the wild west no
[55:01] no this is a much more violent time this
[55:04] is not hanging somebody with a rope by
[55:06] the neck this is setting up a pole and
[55:08] then impaling the person on the
[55:11] pole uh it's just terrible and I'm not
[55:14] going to show you a
[55:16] picture but uh just so what you
[55:18] understand when it's talking about
[55:19] hanging on a Gallow it means
[55:22] impaling on a pole
[55:27] well what happens next the cor archives
[55:29] now we're up to year 12 this is another
[55:33] seven years have pass right or another
[55:35] several years
[55:37] anyway we pick up the story again but it
[55:40] says here H Haman plots against the
[55:44] Jews who's h on why does he hate Jewish
[55:49] people chapter three after these things
[55:51] king of hazar promoted Haman the son of
[55:54] Hamad the agagite and advanced him and
[55:57] set his seat above all the princes who
[56:00] were with him now he outranks Muk and he
[56:02] outranks those other seven guys from
[56:04] chapter one so he is the King's senior
[56:08] advisor and all the king's servants who
[56:11] were within the king's gate bowed and
[56:13] paid homage to Haman for so the king had
[56:16] commanded concerning him a bit like
[56:20] bowing the knee to Joseph at the order
[56:22] of pharaoh back in Genesis except how
[56:27] is no Joseph but morai would not bow or
[56:31] pay homage then the king's servants who
[56:34] were within the king's gate said to
[56:36] Mori who do you think you are why do you
[56:39] transgress the King's Command now what
[56:42] happened when they spoke with him daily
[56:44] and he would not listen to them that
[56:47] they told it to hamon to see whether
[56:49] mori's words would stand for morai had
[56:52] told them that he was a Jew
[56:56] perhaps he's thinking like Daniel before
[56:58] Nebuchadnezzar years before after Daniel
[57:00] got away with not bowing down to that
[57:02] image that he didn't have to bow down
[57:04] either we we don't know that or Pride or
[57:07] whatever we we simply don't
[57:09] know when Haman saw that morai did not
[57:13] bow or pay him homage Haman was filled
[57:17] with
[57:18] wrath so we see of this upcoming problem
[57:22] that they're going to have that mori's
[57:24] behavior is triggering the disaster
[57:28] there's no mention of God or a
[57:30] commandment we don't know why he didn't
[57:33] bow why he didn't pay homage we simply
[57:36] know that he did
[57:38] not but Haman disdained to lay hands on
[57:42] morai alone for they had told him of the
[57:46] people of morai instead Haman sought to
[57:51] destroy all the Jews who were throughout
[57:53] the whole Kingdom of a azus the people
[57:58] of
[57:59] Mori I wonder if Haman and Hamas come
[58:03] from the same
[58:05] rote I don't know just I wonder in the
[58:08] first month which is the month of Nissan
[58:11] April in the 12th year of King azerus
[58:13] they cast poor they rolled dice whatever
[58:16] they did in order to figure out oh what
[58:19] are we going to do this terrible thing
[58:22] so they cast Pur that is the lot before
[58:24] Haman to determine the day day and the
[58:27] month until it fell in the 12th month
[58:30] which is the month of Adar March then
[58:34] Haman said to King
[58:37] azerus there is a certain people
[58:40] scattered and dispersed among the people
[58:43] in all the provinces of your kingdom
[58:46] their laws are different from all other
[58:49] peoples they do not keep the king's laws
[58:53] therefore it's not fitting for the king
[58:56] to let them
[58:57] remain if it pleases the king let a
[59:01] decree be written that they be destroyed
[59:04] and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver
[59:06] into the hands of those who do the work
[59:08] to bring it to the king's
[59:11] treasuries going to make you a rich guy
[59:13] and Destroy these
[59:16] people so the king took a signant ring
[59:20] from his hand and gave it to Haman the
[59:24] son of Hamad the agagite
[59:26] the enemy of the
[59:28] Jews a Signet
[59:32] ring well here are two signant rings the
[59:35] the one on the left is a gold ring from
[59:40] the fifth century BC in Persia so this
[59:42] ring existed at the time of Esther it
[59:45] was made about about that time the ring
[59:48] on the right it demonstrates how such a
[59:52] ring was used
[59:56] a document was rolled up ceiling wax
[59:58] melted on it to prevent it from being
[1:00:00] unrolled and while the wax was still
[1:00:02] soft the ring was used to make an
[1:00:04] impression on the wax and this way
[1:00:07] without a matching ring the document can
[1:00:09] not be tampered with and its
[1:00:11] authenticity could thus be
[1:00:13] verified we're getting back to the text
[1:00:15] the king said to
[1:00:18] Haman the money and the people are given
[1:00:21] to you do with them as seems good to
[1:00:24] you thus showing it some level his
[1:00:26] disdain for these people that he ruled
[1:00:29] as well as his trust in the advice and
[1:00:32] Judgment of Haman unlike Cyrus or duras
[1:00:36] he doesn't investigate he doesn't check
[1:00:38] the records he just tells pan to see to
[1:00:41] it as his senior advisor he must be
[1:00:43] correct right then the king's scribes
[1:00:46] were called on the 13th day of the first
[1:00:48] month that's April 17th last Wednesday
[1:00:52] and a decree was written according to
[1:00:53] all that Haman commanded to the King s
[1:00:56] traps to the governors who were over
[1:00:57] each province to the officials of all
[1:00:59] the people to every
[1:01:01] Province according to its script and to
[1:01:04] every people in their language and the
[1:01:06] name of King azus it was written and
[1:01:08] sealed with a king's signant ring a
[1:01:12] little sidebar when I was in Japan
[1:01:13] several years ago staying with a a
[1:01:16] Japanese friend over there he showed me
[1:01:18] he had a a stamp and and it was a
[1:01:21] handcarved and special little stamp and
[1:01:23] in Japan in in America if ass signed a
[1:01:25] contract you sign the contract they try
[1:01:27] and do a signature verification it's
[1:01:29] hard to do with me because it's just a
[1:01:30] weird scribble that changes every time
[1:01:32] but but in Japan they use this special
[1:01:35] stem that's his legal signature my
[1:01:38] friend pointed out to me that if
[1:01:39] somebody stole that and used it he could
[1:01:41] become legally obligated to buy a house
[1:01:43] or a car or whatever because that's his
[1:01:46] legal signature so signant ring is very
[1:01:49] much the same thing but that's just a
[1:01:51] modern example
[1:01:56] the letters were sent by couriers into
[1:01:57] all the king's provinces to destroy to
[1:02:00] kill and to annihilate all the Jews both
[1:02:04] young and old little children and women
[1:02:07] in one day the 13th day of the 12th
[1:02:09] month which is the month of Adar
[1:02:10] corresponding to March 7th and to
[1:02:12] plunder their possessions steal their
[1:02:17] stuff a copy of the document was to be
[1:02:19] issued his law in every Province being
[1:02:22] published for all people that they
[1:02:23] should be ready for that day the
[1:02:24] couriers went out Ed by the King's
[1:02:26] Command and the decree was proclaimed in
[1:02:28] shushan the Citadel so the king and
[1:02:32] hamon sat down to drink but the city of
[1:02:36] shushan was
[1:02:39] perplexed what what's the king doing
[1:02:43] what's up with him
[1:02:45] on well we move up a couple of months
[1:02:48] here over the next couple of months most
[1:02:50] of the events of the book occur we see
[1:02:52] Esther is not just a beautiful woman as
[1:02:54] she becomes a heroine and morai is not
[1:02:57] just a Man Too Proud to acknowledge the
[1:02:59] number two person in the Empire chapter
[1:03:02] 4 when morai learned all that had
[1:03:05] happened he tore his clothes and put on
[1:03:07] sack law think of burlap like a feed
[1:03:10] sack coarse fibrous cloth sackcloth in
[1:03:14] ashes and went out into the midst of the
[1:03:16] city he cried out with a loud and bitter
[1:03:20] cry he went as far as the front of the
[1:03:23] king's gate for no one might enter the
[1:03:25] king's gate clothed with
[1:03:27] sackcloth and in every
[1:03:30] province with the King's Command and
[1:03:32] decree arrived there was great mourning
[1:03:35] among the Jews with fasting weeping and
[1:03:39] wailing many lay in sackcloth and Ashes
[1:03:43] you notice not only is God's name not
[1:03:45] mentioned prayer is not
[1:03:48] mentioned so Esther's maids and Unix
[1:03:51] came and told her about morai and the
[1:03:54] queen was deeply distressed then she
[1:03:57] sent garments to clothe morai and take a
[1:03:59] sacko away from
[1:04:01] him but he would not accept them then
[1:04:05] Esther called hatok one of the king's
[1:04:07] unic whom he had appointed to attend her
[1:04:09] and she gave him a command concerning
[1:04:11] morai to learn what and why this
[1:04:16] was so hat hat went out to morai in the
[1:04:19] city square that was in front of the
[1:04:20] king's gate and morai told him all that
[1:04:22] had happened to him and the sum of money
[1:04:25] that Haman had promised to pay into the
[1:04:27] king's treasuries to destroy the
[1:04:31] Jews morai also gave him a copy of the
[1:04:34] written decree for the Jewish people's
[1:04:36] destruction which was given at chushan
[1:04:39] that he might show it to Esther and
[1:04:41] explain it to her and that he might
[1:04:44] command her to go into the king to make
[1:04:47] supplication to him and plead before him
[1:04:51] for her
[1:04:52] people so hot returned
[1:04:56] and told Esther the words of
[1:04:59] Mori then Esther spoke to hotot and gave
[1:05:02] him a command for
[1:05:06] Mori all the king's PE all the king's
[1:05:09] servants and the people the king's
[1:05:11] provinces know that any man or woman who
[1:05:13] goes into the inner Court to the king he
[1:05:16] has but one law put all to death except
[1:05:19] the one to whom the king holds out the
[1:05:21] golden scepter that he may live yet I
[1:05:24] myself have not been called to go into
[1:05:25] to the king these 30
[1:05:27] days so Esther's servants told Mori
[1:05:31] Esther's words and morai told them to to
[1:05:35] answer
[1:05:38] Esther do not think in your heart that
[1:05:41] you will escape in the king's Palace any
[1:05:44] more than all the other
[1:05:46] Jews for if you remain completely silent
[1:05:50] at this time relief and deliverance will
[1:05:53] arise for the Jews from an place but you
[1:05:57] and your father's house will perish yet
[1:06:00] who knows whether you have come to the
[1:06:02] kingdom for such a time as
[1:06:06] this then Esther's true colors came out
[1:06:09] and she courageously told them to reply
[1:06:12] to
[1:06:13] Mori
[1:06:15] go gather all the Jews who are in who
[1:06:18] are present in sushan and fast for me
[1:06:20] neither eat nor drink for three days
[1:06:22] night or day My Maids and I will Fast
[1:06:24] likewise and so I go and to the King
[1:06:27] which is against the law and if I perish
[1:06:31] I
[1:06:32] perish so morai went his way and did
[1:06:37] according to all that Esther commanded
[1:06:40] him morai is accustomed to giving orders
[1:06:44] to Esther he's now taking orders from
[1:06:47] her and an effort to averted
[1:06:50] disaster that he had it invert triggered
[1:06:55] chapter five now it happened on the
[1:06:58] third day that Esther put on her royal
[1:07:01] robes and stood in the inner Court of
[1:07:03] the king's Palace across from the King's
[1:07:05] house while the king sat on his Royal
[1:07:09] House facing the entrance of the
[1:07:12] house on the third
[1:07:15] day on the third day Jesus rose from
[1:07:19] Death on the third day Esther Rose to
[1:07:23] face death
[1:07:28] so it
[1:07:29] was when the king saw Queen Esther
[1:07:33] standing in the
[1:07:37] court so it was when the king saw Queen
[1:07:41] Esther standing in the court that she
[1:07:43] found favor in his sight Grace and the
[1:07:47] King held out to Esther the golden
[1:07:49] septer that was in his hand granting
[1:07:52] life instead of death then Esther went
[1:07:54] near and touch the top of the scepter I
[1:07:59] can hear Brother
[1:08:00] brandom telling us that a pardon is not
[1:08:04] a pardon unless it's
[1:08:07] accepted as a pardon Jesus died to pay
[1:08:09] for our
[1:08:10] sins but it only has effect if we accept
[1:08:15] it and the King said to
[1:08:18] her what do you wish Queen Esther it
[1:08:22] must be important to you you wouldn't
[1:08:24] have risked your life to come here what
[1:08:26] is your request it shall be given to you
[1:08:28] after to half the
[1:08:29] kingdom ask what you will in my name and
[1:08:32] I'll do it says the king so Esther
[1:08:38] answered if it pleases the king let the
[1:08:41] king and hamon come today to a banquet
[1:08:43] that I prepared for
[1:08:46] him then the king said bring Haman
[1:08:49] quickly that he may go to do as Esther
[1:08:51] has said so the king and Aman went to
[1:08:54] the banquet that ES had
[1:08:56] prepared at the banquet of wine the king
[1:08:59] said to Esther what is your petition it
[1:09:03] shall be granted you what is your
[1:09:05] request up to half the kingdom it it
[1:09:07] shall be done you you certainly wouldn't
[1:09:10] risk your life as you did simply to
[1:09:12] invite the two of us to lunch oh by the
[1:09:15] way it was a very good lunch then Esther
[1:09:18] answered and
[1:09:20] said if
[1:09:23] it my petition request is this if I have
[1:09:27] found favor in the sight of the king and
[1:09:29] if it pleases the king to Grant my
[1:09:30] petition and fulfill my request then let
[1:09:32] the king and hmon come to the banquet
[1:09:35] which I will prepare for them and I will
[1:09:38] do as the King has
[1:09:41] said so hamon went out that day joyful
[1:09:46] and with a glad heart but when hamon saw
[1:09:49] Mori in the king's gate and that he did
[1:09:52] not stand or tremble before him he was
[1:09:56] filled with indignation against morai
[1:10:00] nevertheless Haman restrained himself
[1:10:02] and went home and he sent and called for
[1:10:06] his friends and his wife his Ares and
[1:10:08] Haman told them of his great riches the
[1:10:11] multitude of his children everything
[1:10:13] which the king had promoted him how he
[1:10:14] Advanced him above all the officials and
[1:10:17] Servants of the king moreover Haman
[1:10:20] said besides Queen Esther invited no one
[1:10:24] but me to come in with the king to the
[1:10:26] banquet that she prepared tomorrow I'm
[1:10:30] again invited by her along with the
[1:10:34] King yet all this avails me nothing so
[1:10:36] long as I see morai the Jews sitting at
[1:10:39] the king's
[1:10:40] gate then his wife zes and all his
[1:10:43] friends said to him let a Gallows be
[1:10:46] made 75 feet tall and in the morning
[1:10:50] suggested the king that Mori be hanged
[1:10:53] on it
[1:10:56] making him a public spectacle as he rise
[1:10:59] and screams impaled on it then go
[1:11:02] merrily with the King to the
[1:11:04] banquet and the thing pleased him on so
[1:11:08] he had the Galos
[1:11:11] made but that night the king couldn't
[1:11:15] sleep so one was commanded to bring the
[1:11:18] book of the records of The Chronicles
[1:11:19] and they were read before the king you
[1:11:22] have a problem in going to sleep find a
[1:11:23] really boring book read it if you can't
[1:11:27] read have somebody read it to
[1:11:29] you right so they brought in the the
[1:11:32] phone book for shushan and read all the
[1:11:35] so they brought the book of records and
[1:11:38] it was found written that morai had told
[1:11:40] of bana and terish two of the King's
[1:11:42] unic The doorkeepers Who had sought to
[1:11:44] lay hands on King azerus some six years
[1:11:50] earlier then the king said what honor or
[1:11:53] dignity has been bestowed on morai for
[1:11:55] this and the King's servants who
[1:11:57] attended him said nothing has been done
[1:12:00] for him so the king said who who Who's
[1:12:05] in the
[1:12:06] court now Haman had just entered the
[1:12:08] outer Court of the king's Palace to
[1:12:10] suggest that the king hang morai on The
[1:12:13] Gallows that he had prepared for him the
[1:12:15] king's servant said to him haman's there
[1:12:18] standing in the court the king said let
[1:12:21] him come in so Haman came in and the
[1:12:23] King asked him what shall be done for
[1:12:26] the man whom the king Delights to honor
[1:12:30] you're my advisor tell me what what do
[1:12:32] you
[1:12:33] think now Haman thought in his heart huh
[1:12:37] who would the king toight to
[1:12:39] honor more than me Haman answered the
[1:12:43] king for for the man whom the king
[1:12:47] Delights to honor let a royal robe be
[1:12:50] brought in which the King has worn and
[1:12:53] and a horse on which the k King has
[1:12:55] ridden and which has a Royal Crest
[1:12:58] placed on his head then let this robe
[1:13:01] and horse be delivered to the hand of
[1:13:03] one of the king's most noble princes
[1:13:06] that he may array the man whom the king
[1:13:09] Delights to honor then parade him on
[1:13:13] Horseback through the city square and
[1:13:16] Proclaim before him thus shall it be
[1:13:18] done to the man whom the king Delights
[1:13:21] to
[1:13:23] honor the king said to Hammon oh I like
[1:13:27] that hurry take the robe and the horse
[1:13:29] as you have suggested and do so for
[1:13:32] morai the Jew who sits within the king's
[1:13:34] gate leave nothing of done of all that
[1:13:37] you have
[1:13:41] spoken so Haman took the robe and the
[1:13:43] horse arrayed Mori led him on Horseback
[1:13:46] through the city square and proclaimed
[1:13:48] before him thus shall it be done to the
[1:13:51] man whom the king Delights to honor
[1:13:56] afterward morai went back to the king's
[1:13:58] gate but Haman hurried to his house
[1:14:00] mourning with his head covered when
[1:14:03] Haman told his wife zarish and all his
[1:14:05] friends everything that had happened to
[1:14:06] him his wise men and his wife zarish
[1:14:09] said to him if Mori before whom you have
[1:14:14] begun to fall is of Jewish descent you
[1:14:18] will not Prevail against him but will
[1:14:21] surely fall before him
[1:14:25] while they were still talking with him
[1:14:27] the king's Unix came and hastened to
[1:14:30] bring Haman to the banquet which Esther
[1:14:33] had
[1:14:34] prepared so the king and Haman went to
[1:14:37] dine with Queen
[1:14:39] Esther isn't she a beautiful queen I
[1:14:42] think this is
[1:14:43] [Applause]
[1:14:46] just on the second day at the banquet of
[1:14:49] wine the King again said to Esther what
[1:14:53] is your petition Queen Esther it shall
[1:14:55] be granted you and what is your request
[1:14:59] up to half the kingdom it shall be done
[1:15:02] it I don't know about you this reminds
[1:15:05] me of the story of hady Wright you can
[1:15:08] have what you want just name it and just
[1:15:12] like Haddie Wright both answered seeking
[1:15:15] the welfare of their
[1:15:18] people then Queen Esther answered and
[1:15:21] said if I have found favor in your sight
[1:15:23] O King and if if it pleases the king let
[1:15:26] my life be given me at my petition and
[1:15:28] my people at my request for we have been
[1:15:30] sold my people and I to be destroyed to
[1:15:33] be killed and to be annihilated had we
[1:15:36] been sold as male and female slaves I
[1:15:38] would have held my tongue although the
[1:15:40] enemy can never compensate for the
[1:15:42] king's loss so King azerus answered and
[1:15:46] said to Queen Esther who is he where is
[1:15:49] he that would dare presume in his heart
[1:15:51] to do such a thing the King still does
[1:15:54] not know that his Queen is Jewish or he
[1:15:58] would know that he had agreed to and
[1:16:00] ordered this very
[1:16:02] destruction and Esther said the
[1:16:05] adversary an enemy is this wicked
[1:16:08] hmon so Haman was terrified before the
[1:16:11] king and queen then the king arose in
[1:16:13] his wrath from the banquet of wine and
[1:16:15] went into the palace Garden but Haman
[1:16:17] stood before Queen eser pleading for his
[1:16:20] life for he saw that evil was determined
[1:16:23] against him by the king when the King
[1:16:25] returned from the palace Garden to the
[1:16:27] place of the banquet of
[1:16:29] wine Haman had fallen across the couch
[1:16:31] where Esther was then the king said will
[1:16:34] he also assault the queen while I am in
[1:16:36] the house as the word left the king's
[1:16:39] mouth they covered Hon's
[1:16:41] face now harbana one of the unic said to
[1:16:46] the
[1:16:47] king look the Gallow 75 ft High which
[1:16:52] Haman made for morai who spoke good on
[1:16:55] the king's behalf is standing at the
[1:16:58] house of Haman and the King said hang
[1:17:02] him on
[1:17:03] it wow so they hanged him on on The
[1:17:06] Gallows that he had prepared for
[1:17:10] Mori then the king's wrath subsided
[1:17:15] chapter8 on that day King azerus gave
[1:17:18] Queen Esther the house of Haman the
[1:17:21] enemy of the Jews and Mori came before
[1:17:23] the king for Esther had told him how he
[1:17:25] was related to her so the king took off
[1:17:28] his signant ring which he had taken from
[1:17:31] Haman and gave it to morai and Esther
[1:17:35] appointed morai over the house of
[1:17:39] Haman Now esther
[1:17:43] went Uninvited and spoke again to the
[1:17:49] king fell down at his feet and implored
[1:17:51] him with tears to counteract the evil of
[1:17:54] hman the a agite in the scheme which he
[1:17:56] had devised against the Jews and the
[1:17:58] King held out the golden scepter to
[1:18:03] Esther so Esther arose and stood before
[1:18:06] the king and said if it pleases the king
[1:18:09] and if I have found favor in the side in
[1:18:11] his sight and the thing seems right to
[1:18:13] The King and I am pleasing in his eyes
[1:18:15] Let It Be written to revoke the letters
[1:18:17] devised by hamon the son of hamadaa the
[1:18:20] agagite which he wrote to annihilate the
[1:18:22] Jews who are in all the king's provinces
[1:18:24] for How Can I Endure to see the evil
[1:18:26] that will come to my people or How Can I
[1:18:28] Endure to see the destruction of my
[1:18:31] countrymen then King azerus said to
[1:18:34] Queen Esther and Mori the Jew indeed I
[1:18:38] have given Esther the house of Haman and
[1:18:40] they have hanged him on the Gallows
[1:18:42] because he tried to lay his hand on the
[1:18:44] Jews you yourselves write a decree
[1:18:48] concerning the Jews as you please in the
[1:18:50] king's name Seal it with the king
[1:18:53] signant ring for whatever is written in
[1:18:55] the king's name and sealed with the
[1:18:57] king's signant Ring no one can
[1:19:01] revoke so the king's scribes were called
[1:19:04] at that time in the third month which is
[1:19:07] the month of cvon on the 23rd day June
[1:19:10] 25th and it was written according to all
[1:19:12] that morai commanded to the Jews the
[1:19:14] satraps and governors the princes of the
[1:19:16] provinces from India to Ethiopia 127
[1:19:19] provinces in all to every province in
[1:19:21] its own script to every people in their
[1:19:23] own language and to the Jews in their
[1:19:26] own script and language and he wrote In
[1:19:29] The Name of King azerus sealed it with
[1:19:31] the king signant ring and sent Letters
[1:19:32] by couriers on horseback riding on Royal
[1:19:35] horses bred from Swift steeds by these
[1:19:39] letters the king permitted the Jews who
[1:19:41] were in every city to gather together
[1:19:44] and protect their lives to defend
[1:19:47] themselves to destroy kill and
[1:19:49] annihilate all the forces of any people
[1:19:51] or province that would assault them both
[1:19:54] little children and women and to plunder
[1:19:57] their possessions on one day in all the
[1:20:00] provinces of King azerus on the 13th day
[1:20:02] the 12th month which is the month of
[1:20:05] Adar a copy of the document was to be
[1:20:08] issued as a decree in every Province and
[1:20:10] published for all people so that the
[1:20:12] Jews would be ready on that day to
[1:20:14] avenge themselves on their enemies the
[1:20:16] couriers who rode on Royal horses went
[1:20:18] out hastened and pressed on by the
[1:20:21] King's Command and the decree was issued
[1:20:23] in shushan the
[1:20:26] Citadel so morai went out from the
[1:20:29] presence of the king in Royal apparel of
[1:20:31] blue and white with a great crown of
[1:20:34] gold and a garment of fine linen and
[1:20:36] purple and the City of shushan rejoiced
[1:20:39] and was glad the Jews had light and
[1:20:42] gladness joy and honor and in every
[1:20:45] Province and
[1:20:48] City wherever the King's Command and
[1:20:50] decree had come the Jews had a joy and
[1:20:54] gladness a feast and a holiday then many
[1:20:57] of the people of the land became Jews
[1:20:59] because the fear of the Jews fell upon
[1:21:01] them notice the old decree could not be
[1:21:05] analed they couldn't tear it up and
[1:21:07] throw it away it still stood but was
[1:21:09] sent out under the Seal of the king but
[1:21:12] the new decree gave the Jewish people
[1:21:14] the right to resist and further to
[1:21:17] attack and destroy their
[1:21:20] enemies our struggle against our natures
[1:21:25] ly's struggle against Lyle's nature
[1:21:29] isn't
[1:21:31] passive against our spiritual enemies is
[1:21:34] not passive we have to take up our
[1:21:36] weapons identify and destroy that which
[1:21:39] would otherwise destroy
[1:21:44] us nine months go
[1:21:48] by Esther 9 now in the 12th month that
[1:21:51] is the month of D on the 13th day the
[1:21:53] time came for the King's Command and his
[1:21:55] decree to be executed on the day that
[1:21:57] the enemies of the Jews had hoped to
[1:21:59] overpower them the opposite occurred and
[1:22:02] that the Jews themselves overpowered
[1:22:04] those who hated them the Jews gathered
[1:22:07] together in their cities throughout all
[1:22:09] the provinces of King a hasus to lay
[1:22:10] hands on those who sought their harm and
[1:22:13] no one could withstand them because fear
[1:22:16] of them fell upon all people and all the
[1:22:20] officials of the provinces the satraps
[1:22:22] the governors and all those doing the
[1:22:24] king's worked help the Jews because the
[1:22:26] fear of Mori fell upon them for morai
[1:22:30] was great in the king's Palace and his
[1:22:32] Fame spread throughout all the provinces
[1:22:35] for this man Mori became increasingly
[1:22:39] prominent thus the Jews defeated all
[1:22:41] their enemies with the stroke of the
[1:22:43] sword with Slaughter and destruction and
[1:22:46] did what they pleased with those who
[1:22:48] hated them and in shushan the Citadel
[1:22:50] the Jews killed and destroyed 500
[1:22:53] men all also

[1:23:13] Jews they killed but they did not lay a
[1:23:16] hand on the
[1:23:18] plunder on that
[1:23:22] oops on that day
[1:23:25] the number of those who were killed in
[1:23:26] shushan the CIT was brought to the king
[1:23:28] and the King said to Queen
[1:23:30] Esther the Jews have killed and
[1:23:33] destroyed 500 men in shusan the Citadel
[1:23:36] and the 10 sons of
[1:23:38] Haman what have they done in the rest of
[1:23:41] the king's provinces now what is your
[1:23:43] petition it shall be granted to you what
[1:23:46] is your further
[1:23:48] request it shall be done then Esther
[1:23:52] said
[1:23:55] if it pleases the king let it be granted
[1:23:57] to the Jews who are in sushan to do
[1:24:00] again tomorrow according to today's
[1:24:02] decree and let Hon's 10 Sons be hanged
[1:24:05] on The
[1:24:07] Gallows well
[1:24:12] done so the king commanded this to be
[1:24:14] done the decree was issued in shushan
[1:24:17] and they hanged haman's 10 Sons so the
[1:24:20] dead bodies were impaled on spikes
[1:24:24] and the Jews who were in shushan
[1:24:26] gathered together again on the 14th day
[1:24:28] of the month of Adar and killed 300
[1:24:31] additional men at shushan but they did
[1:24:32] not lay a hand on the
[1:24:35] plunder the remainder of the Jews in the
[1:24:37] king's provinces gathered together and
[1:24:39] Protected Their Lives had rest from
[1:24:41] their enemies and killed 75,000 of their
[1:24:44] enemies but they did not lay a hand on
[1:24:46] the
[1:24:47] plunder this was on the 13th day of the
[1:24:51] month of Adar and on the 14th day of the
[1:24:53] month they rested and made it a day of
[1:24:56] feasting and
[1:24:58] gladness but the Jews who at shusan
[1:25:00] assembled together on the 13th day as
[1:25:02] well as on the 14th and on the 15th of
[1:25:05] the month they rested and made it a day
[1:25:07] of
[1:25:08] feasting and
[1:25:11] gladness we're we're running out of time
[1:25:14] please read the remainder of this
[1:25:16] chapter nine at home in it the feast or
[1:25:20] holiday of purm is established to be
[1:25:24] observed reserved by the Jewish people
[1:25:25] Forever on the 14th and 15th of Adar
[1:25:29] Adar is the last month of the Jewish
[1:25:30] calendar this year 2024 Pim was observed
[1:25:35] on March 23 and
[1:25:39] 24 the book ends we'll read the last
[1:25:41] verse chapter
[1:25:43] 10:3 for morai the Jew was second to
[1:25:47] King azerus and was great among the Jews
[1:25:50] and well received by the multitude of
[1:25:52] his Brethren seeking the good of his
[1:25:53] people and speaking peace to all his
[1:25:59] countrymen excuse me in Jewish
[1:26:04] practice the Book of Esther is read
[1:26:07] twice in the evening of the first day as
[1:26:10] well as in the morning of the two-day
[1:26:12] celebration of Pim
[1:26:16] children are given noise
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:19] makers this one happens to have a
[1:26:22] likeness of Haman
[1:26:25] and the practice is that whenever
[1:26:28] they're reading the text and the name
[1:26:30] Haman comes up whenever anyone says Ham
[1:26:34] on you want to drown out and erase his
[1:26:36] name from memory and the other thing
[1:26:39] that you do
[1:26:41] is
[1:26:43] boo but you have to be quick because it
[1:26:45] only takes a moment to say h
[1:26:49] on the children love this okay this is a
[1:26:54] holiday that is really focused on
[1:26:57] children their celebration I I used to
[1:27:00] call it Jewish Halloween a family that
[1:27:01] we know really well I remember one year
[1:27:03] when I was a kid they showed me a
[1:27:04] picture of their two kids their son and
[1:27:06] their daughter and one was dressed up as
[1:27:08] a teapot one was dressed up as a coffee
[1:27:10] pot it was it was it was just they were
[1:27:12] just having fun they were having fun
[1:27:15] they were they were
[1:27:16] just having fun I think I said that yeah
[1:27:20] so so what we're going to do this
[1:27:22] evening when when uh
[1:27:24] when everyone's excused is we have some
[1:27:28] for the children so they can practice
[1:27:30] for pering for next
[1:27:32] year and uh sister Martha has prepared
[1:27:35] some treats for the kids because it's uh
[1:27:38] that's what you do it's a celebration
[1:27:40] right so uh so as as we leave they'll
[1:27:44] have that handed out and and and so
[1:27:46] forth so again this is just part of the
[1:27:48] of the Jewish tradition and and and
[1:27:52] celebration well
[1:27:55] we've just read of Destruction turned to
[1:27:59] Victory we love these kinds of
[1:28:01] stories but as I mentioned when we began
[1:28:05] there's unrest in our nation today
[1:28:07] unlike any we've witnessed regarding
[1:28:10] Jewish people last week Heather and I
[1:28:13] were in Virginia with our oldest son and
[1:28:15] his wife to celebrate Heather's birthday
[1:28:17] I won't tell you which one we spent
[1:28:20] Sunday afternoon in the Virginia
[1:28:23] Holocaust
[1:28:25] Museum I've been to the one in Israel
[1:28:27] yadvashem and found it deeply
[1:28:30] disturbing the violence portray is not a
[1:28:33] Hollywood fiction this isn't Star Wars
[1:28:36] we see it now from a distance of 80 or
[1:28:38] 90 years people are denying that it
[1:28:41] happened it's history it's not very real
[1:28:45] to many when I was a child it was from a
[1:28:49] distance of 10 or 20 years my friends
[1:28:51] that had dads that had fought in the War
[1:28:54] they saw this
[1:28:56] stuff it was recent it was fresh in the
[1:29:00] 30s and
[1:29:01] 40s 1930s and 40s there was no Esther
[1:29:05] for God to use to stop Hitler the Haman
[1:29:08] of that
[1:29:09] time a family we knew in San Francisco
[1:29:11] during my
[1:29:13] childhood were actually closer to us
[1:29:17] than most of our blood
[1:29:19] relation it turns out that they were
[1:29:21] Holocaust
[1:29:22] Survivors Ralph the dad his name before
[1:29:26] he left Germany was wolf escaped from
[1:29:29] Germany at age of 11 or 12 early in the
[1:29:31] Nazi Reign around 1932 or 3 or four I
[1:29:34] forgotten which year he came to
[1:29:36] America sponsored by an uncle his future
[1:29:39] wife lisel escaped in
[1:29:43] 1941 with most of her family I say most
[1:29:46] because those that did not make it with
[1:29:47] them that day that was the last day that
[1:29:51] any Jews escaped from Nazi Germany
[1:29:55] her other relatives perished into death
[1:29:58] camps I remember Lisa telling me that
[1:30:01] Lisa went when she finally arrived in
[1:30:03] America as a
[1:30:05] teenager San Francisco accepted her and
[1:30:08] her family she vowed she would never
[1:30:11] live anywhere else and until the day she
[1:30:13] died she lived in San
[1:30:16] Francisco I say this Jewish Family the
[1:30:19] errands were closer than much of our
[1:30:21] family when Mom and Dad heard the
[1:30:23] message decided to leave San Jose and
[1:30:25] come to
[1:30:26] Tucson the errand told my
[1:30:30] parents we don't understand why you're
[1:30:32] doing
[1:30:33] this but if things don't work out for
[1:30:36] you there you're welcome to come to our
[1:30:39] home and stay with us until you can get
[1:30:43] back on your
[1:30:44] feet when 911 occurred I reached out to
[1:30:49] a Muslim friend of mine in the
[1:30:50] Washington DC area Heather and I invited
[1:30:54] him and his extended family to come and
[1:30:56] stay with us until whatever was going on
[1:30:58] was sorted out I knew he was no part of
[1:31:02] any faction involved in the events of
[1:31:04] that day and wanted him to know that
[1:31:07] he'd be safe with
[1:31:09] us we don't have to agree with or even
[1:31:13] understand another's perspective to
[1:31:15] reach out and provide friendship comfort
[1:31:18] and support Jesus didn't say come unto
[1:31:21] me all you who agree with me in my
[1:31:23] interpretation and I will give you
[1:31:26] rest I saw a sign in the Holocaust
[1:31:29] Museum that I want to share with
[1:31:34] you first this is a pastor in Nazi
[1:31:38] Germany first they came for the
[1:31:40] Communists I wasn't a communist I didn't
[1:31:43] speak out then they came for the
[1:31:46] Socialists and the trade unionists but I
[1:31:49] wasn't one of them so I didn't speak out
[1:31:52] when they went after the Jews I didn't
[1:31:55] speak I wasn't a Jew when they came for
[1:31:59] me there was no one left to speak for
[1:32:04] me I'll end these personal remarks with
[1:32:07] the observation that compassion is
[1:32:09] good but it's not enough there's a time
[1:32:12] to ring our hands and there's a time to
[1:32:15] roll up our sleeves it's our actions
[1:32:18] that count coming from the right
[1:32:22] motives well let's take take a closer
[1:32:24] look what lessons can we take home from
[1:32:28] Esther if the musicians would please
[1:32:30] come as I indicated when we started this
[1:32:33] evening the name of the Lord never
[1:32:34] appears in the text the closest we come
[1:32:36] is when morai admonishes Esther in
[1:32:39] chapter 4:4 for if you remain completely
[1:32:42] silent at this time relief and
[1:32:44] deliverance will arise for the Jews from
[1:32:46] another place but you and your father's
[1:32:49] house will perish yet who knows whether
[1:32:51] you have come to the kingdom for such
[1:32:53] such a time as
[1:32:55] this how do we serve God by serving his
[1:33:00] people Jesus said in Matthew 25 in as
[1:33:02] much as you've done it unto the least of
[1:33:04] these my brethren you've done it unto me
[1:33:08] both good and bad how does God
[1:33:12] intervene most often through his people
[1:33:17] what brother random once referred to as
[1:33:19] god with skin on
[1:33:20] it Moses followed the cloud and the
[1:33:23] pillar of fire an amazing display of the
[1:33:26] supernatural but no one else did not
[1:33:29] even Jesus we so often look for the
[1:33:32] supernatural but God's not a showoff and
[1:33:36] more often Works through natural means
[1:33:38] quietly in the background yet it's the
[1:33:41] very same God at work we often Proclaim
[1:33:45] thus and so in the name of Jesus it's
[1:33:47] not some magic incantation but we
[1:33:51] sometimes seem to treat it as such we
[1:33:54] are to proclaim the name certainly but
[1:33:55] it's the life that we live that shows if
[1:33:58] it's just a name just words or if
[1:34:02] there's something there Heather and I
[1:34:05] are routine
[1:34:08] Inseparable but what about the Lord and
[1:34:11] I the Lord and
[1:34:14] you women in this book have great
[1:34:16] influence vashy Esther zarish you can be
[1:34:19] sure Heather has great influence on me
[1:34:24] well let's close in song There's a song

[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] distress there's never any
[1:45:26] reason to give up in
[1:45:31] dismay just slip away and breae his
[1:45:36] name he will come and meet you
[1:45:43] there in the
[1:45:48] presence of Je
[1:45:55] God
[1:45:59] almight friend
[1:46:04] of
[1:46:06] TR
[1:46:10] and hearts are
[1:46:15] mened in the presence
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:23] the
[1:46:24] king before we dismissed I also want to
[1:46:27] remind
[1:46:27] everyone um brother Lyall touched on at
[1:46:31] the beginning that we are seeing an
[1:46:32] unprecedented time in our country and
[1:46:35] around the
[1:46:37] world I won't say it's unprecedented I'm
[1:46:39] sorry it's it's had a precedent
[1:46:42] set um thousands of years ago we read
[1:46:45] about it in the book of eser today and
[1:46:48] uh I preached on the Prince of Persia
[1:46:50] the other day and you see that same
[1:46:54] anointing that same evil spirit That
[1:46:56] Came Upon This Man
[1:46:58] hon and how he hated the Jewish people
[1:47:03] and we see now on college campuses
[1:47:06] around the country
[1:47:08] hatred for the Jewish people and they
[1:47:10] use
[1:47:11] excuses so brothers and sisters I
[1:47:13] believe that we have an
[1:47:15] obligation as Christians as those that
[1:47:19] have
[1:47:20] benefited from the blind eyes of the
[1:47:23] Jewish
[1:47:25] people that we would pray for our
[1:47:28] brothers and sisters our Jewish brothers
[1:47:31] and sisters that they would be safe at
[1:47:34] this time I just pray that it wouldn't
[1:47:38] escalate and go into something that's
[1:47:41] happened many times over the years so
[1:47:44] please keep
[1:47:47] them a race of people in your hearts and
[1:47:51] in your minds in the days the coming
[1:47:54] days and the coming weeks the Lord would
[1:47:57] protect them I know he will but I also
[1:48:00] believe that the Lord does honor our
[1:48:03] prayers I know if there's one person
[1:48:07] that if you want to get to
[1:48:09] me and you can't get directly to me
[1:48:12] there is one
[1:48:13] person that will get to me and that's my
[1:48:17] bride that's my
[1:48:19] wife and I believe as the bride of
[1:48:22] Christ
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:24] that God will lend down his ear for his
[1:48:29] sweetheart and hear the prayers of us
[1:48:33] for these people God bless you brothers
[1:48:35] and sisters you're dismissed I'm so
[1:48:38] glad I'm a
