[0:07] Oh, thank

[0:16] for the grace that you have given us.
[0:24] Oh, I can't repay. But from my heart,

[0:34] you.

[1:03] you. One more time.
[1:06] Oh, thank
[1:08] you
[1:10] my Jesus
[1:15] for the grace that you have given us.
[1:22] Oh, I can't repay, but from my heart,
[1:26] I'd like to say that I
[1:30] thank
[1:32] you. Let's stand this evening. Let's
[1:35] make this next song a prayer. I want to
[1:38] live the way he wants me to live. I want
[1:41] to live
[1:44] the way
[1:46] he wants me
[1:49] to live.
[1:51] I want to give
[1:55] until there's just no more to give.
[2:02] I want to love.
[2:06] Love till there's just no more love.
[2:13] I could never
[2:15] never out love the Lord. Let's try verse
[2:20] one.
[2:23] There have been times
[2:26] when giving
[2:29] and loving
[2:31] brought pain.
[2:34] And I promised
[2:36] I would never
[2:39] never let it happen
[2:42] again.
[2:45] But I found out that loving
[2:50] was well worth the risk.
[2:55] And that even
[2:58] in lossing
[3:01] you win.
[3:05] I want to live
[3:09] the way
[3:11] he wants me to live. I want to give
[3:19] until there's just no more to give.
[3:26] I want to love
[3:30] love loved him. There's just no one.
[3:36] I could never
[3:39] never I love the Lord.
[3:47] He showed us
[3:50] that only
[3:52] through dying
[3:55] we live.
[3:57] And he gave
[4:00] when it seemed.
[4:02] There was nothing
[4:05] to give.
[4:08] He loved
[4:10] when loving
[4:13] brought heartache
[4:16] and loss.
[4:18] He forgave
[4:20] from an old rugged
[4:24] cross.
[4:28] I want to live
[4:31] the way
[4:34] he wants me to give.
[4:38] I want to give
[4:41] until there's just no more to give. I
[4:49] want to love.
[4:52] love till there's just no more love.
[4:59] I could never
[5:01] never out love the Lord.
[5:09] Pass
[5:11] me not,
[5:13] oh gentle
[5:15] Savior.
[5:22] Hear
[5:25] my humble
[5:29] cry.
[5:35] While
[5:38] on others thou
[5:42] are calling.
[5:43] [Music]
[5:49] Do
[5:51] not pass
[5:53] me
[5:55] by.
[5:59] I'm praying.
[6:01] Saveior.
[6:03] [Music]
[6:07] Oh my savior.
[6:15] to my
[6:17] humble
[6:20] cry.
[6:26] Smile
[6:29] on others that are calling.
[6:38] Oh, do
[6:41] not pass
[6:43] me
[6:45] by.
[6:49] Have a few prayer requests this evening
[6:51] turned in. Several. Brother Ronnie
[6:53] Glidewell. if you would just come and
[6:55] open the service in prayer and take
[6:56] these needs before the Lord.
[6:59] Sister Hope Buckles writes in, says,
[7:01] "The Lord bless you. I have a prayer
[7:03] request for Susan Haidider. Her husband
[7:05] passed away on
[7:08] [Music]
[7:09] Tuesday. I also have a prayer request
[7:11] for the family of Sister June Seismore.
[7:14] She went to be with the Lord this
[7:16] afternoon. Let's just remember those two
[7:19] families in prayer. Sister Sharon
[7:22] Sortonson asks that we keep her sister
[7:25] Karen in prayer. So, let's just remember
[7:27] Karen. My daughter has a friend, a
[7:31] little neighbor girl or a girl they've
[7:34] met through a different uh place just a
[7:36] few miles from our house and her name's
[7:39] Aman and she got bit this afternoon I
[7:41] guess by her cat and kind of a little
[7:43] more serious than normal. So, let's just
[7:46] remember her that there's no infections
[7:47] or any adverse effects there. Brother Ed
[7:51] Dooall turns in a request from his
[7:53] daughter Melinda. She was asking prayer
[7:56] for a mother she knows who is dealing
[7:57] with a severe alcohol problem. Her
[7:59] husband asked for the church if the
[8:02] church would pray. They had told me that
[8:05] she was at six times the legal limit has
[8:08] little children as young as three years
[8:09] old. So let's just remember those need
[8:12] that need as well. Sister Ameilia also
[8:15] asks that we keep her in prayer. She's
[8:16] going to be going to the doctor tomorrow
[8:19] and she would appreciate our prayers.
[8:22] Amen. You have a need that you unspoken
[8:24] that you'd want to make known with an
[8:26] uplifted hand this evening. As brother
[8:29] Clydewell comes, let's just sing this
[8:30] next verse. Oh, let
[8:35] me at thy throne of mercy.
[8:42] [Music]
[8:45] Find
[8:47] a sweet
[8:50] relief
[8:57] nearing
[9:00] there in deep country.
[9:08] Oh help
[9:11] my ob
[9:15] me.
[9:18] I'm crying.
[9:21] Saveior,
[9:22] [Music]
[9:26] oh Savior.
[9:33] Hear my
[9:36] humble
[9:38] cry.
[9:44] While
[9:47] on others thou art calling,
[9:56] do
[9:58] not pass
[10:01] me by.
[10:08] Thank you.
[10:12] My that's a lot of prayer requests. I
[10:13] could remember them all, but
[10:16] I believe each and every one was given
[10:18] with a sincere heart.
[10:21] And you know, I really enjoy the sermon
[10:24] this morning.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; How many soldiers we got here today? You
[10:29] ready to be put into action?
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; Get your swords out. Get ready. We're in
[10:35] a battle. Brother Brandham said there
[10:37] would be battle scarred veterans. How do
[10:42] you get that? You go to war. We're in a
[10:45] war right now. The war before us is do
[10:49] we believe God's word or we not? I
[10:52] believe God's word. He said if we do
[10:54] this, if we present these petitions
[10:57] before him, he will hear and answer our
[11:00] prayers. Amen.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; So if there's any unbelief here, we just
[11:03] would want to put it aside in the name
[11:05] of the Lord Jesus. And let's go to a
[11:07] prayer. Heavenly Father, first of all,
[11:10] we are so grateful we have a place to
[11:12] come to honor your resurrection.
[11:15] Oh God, for that unbelievable gift you
[11:18] did and that sacrifice you made because
[11:21] you loved us and you wanted us to be
[11:23] saved, Lord Jesus, and not be lost. So
[11:26] now, Father, this this same love I pray
[11:28] that you said that would come and dwell
[11:30] in the believer that we would have
[11:33] compassion, Lord, for those that have
[11:35] asked requests for their friends and
[11:37] their neighbors and their their
[11:38] relatives and different ones, Lord. And
[11:41] I myself, Lord, I I have learned to to
[11:44] know the neighbors and get to love them.
[11:46] And and Lord, when when they have a a
[11:49] request, Lord, we we take it to heart,
[11:51] Father, because we care for them. And
[11:53] we're just that way, Lord. We love our
[11:55] neighbors. We love our friends. And we
[11:57] want the best for them. And we know the
[12:00] only way for that to happen is to pres
[12:02] to go before you in prayer knowing you
[12:05] are a kind, loving father that answers
[12:08] the prayers of your children. And I pray
[12:11] we are your children, Lord. I believe by
[12:13] faith we are. We ask now, Lord, that you
[12:16] would hear each and every request,
[12:18] Father, that there would be reports that
[12:21] that these prayers have been answered.
[12:24] And oh God, for right now in the
[12:27] present, we pray, Lord, that you would
[12:28] just come down and
[12:31] and meet with us and and touch each and
[12:33] every heart. Father, give brother Aaron
[12:36] the words that that we need to hear,
[12:38] Lord. That set him aside, Lord. that it
[12:41] would it would not be him to speak but
[12:43] it would be your spirit speaking through
[12:44] him to touch each and every heart for
[12:46] every need that we have to let us be
[12:49] better people to grow closer to you and
[12:51] draw us stronger. We ask now you
[12:54] continue being with us the rest of the
[12:56] service in the precious name of the Lord
[12:58] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[13:03] Amen. You may be seated this evening.
[13:07] Martha, if you want to come help me do
[13:10] that other song here in a moment.
[13:12] Sing this song as she's coming. Jesus on
[13:16] the main line. Tell him what you want.
[13:18] Amen.
[13:19] We can answer all these needs that were
[13:22] just mentioned.

[13:29] you want.

[15:58] you want.
[16:00] Jesus on the main line now.
[16:08] Amen. This is a song that
[16:11] came to my mind this morning. And I
[16:14] don't think we've ever sang this as a
[16:15] congregational, but this is I want it to
[16:18] be a congregational. If you haven't
[16:19] heard it before, you can learn it. I'm
[16:21] just asking Martha to help with a little
[16:23] bit of the timing on it. But he's made
[16:27] us glad this evening. Amen.
[16:30] I will bless the Lord forever. I will
[16:32] trust him at all times.
[16:42] I
[16:43] will
[16:45] bless the Lord forever.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; I will
[16:57] trust in him at all times.
[17:06] He has delivered me from all fear.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; He has
[17:20] set my feet upon a rock.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; And I will not be moved.
[17:35] And I'll say of the Lord, you are my
[17:41] shield,
[17:43] my strength,
[17:46] my portion
[17:49] deliverer,
[17:52] my shelter,
[17:55] strong tower,
[17:57] my very present help in time of
[18:10] Whom have
[18:13] I in heaven
[18:15] but you?
[18:21] &gt;&gt; There's none
[18:24] I desire beside
[18:27] you.
[18:32] and you have made me glad.
[18:38] I'll say of the Lord, you are my shield,
[18:45] my strength,
[18:48] my portion,
[18:53] my shelter,
[18:56] strong tower,
[18:59] my very present help in time of need.
[19:09] You are my shield,
[19:13] my strength,

[19:24] strong tower,

[19:54] my very present help in time of need.
[20:04] He is our help in our time of need.
[20:06] Amen.
[20:08] Amen. Sister Hope, I believe you have a
[20:11] song special if you just make ready at
[20:13] this time. It's good to be back with you
[20:16] all. We were visited uh eight churches
[20:19] in 18 days. Helped six churches with
[20:22] their sound and two or three churches
[20:25] that were um fairly large projects. And
[20:30] so different ones sent their greetings
[20:32] here. Brother Joe Adams and brother
[20:34] Chris Kathy, brother Daniel Andes, spent
[20:36] the afternoon with brother Matthew
[20:38] McFaten as well and many different
[20:40] others. It was just a nice time, but it
[20:43] was also a lot of work. We worked 12, 14
[20:45] hour days and drove pretty pretty
[20:48] intensely and so forth to get everything
[20:49] done. But it's good to be back with you
[20:51] all. Amen.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Hope.
[21:02] You can sing this with me.
[21:04] Lord,
[21:06] you are
[21:09] more precious
[21:13] than silver.
[21:16] Lord,
[21:18] you are
[21:21] more costly
[21:24] than gold.
[21:27] Lord,
[21:29] you are
[21:33] more beautiful
[21:36] than diamonds.
[21:40] And I think I desire
[21:45] compares
[21:47] with thee,
[21:54] Lord. Lord,
[21:56] you are
[22:00] more precious
[22:04] than silver.
[22:08] Lord,
[22:10] you are
[22:14] more costly
[22:18] than gold.
[22:22] Lord,
[22:24] you are
[22:28] more beautiful
[22:31] than diamonds.
[22:35] And nothing
[22:37] I desire
[22:40] compares
[22:42] with the once more.
[22:49] Lord,
[22:51] you are
[22:55] more precious
[22:58] than silver.
[23:02] Dear Lord,
[23:05] you are
[23:08] more costly
[23:12] than gold.
[23:16] Dear Lord,
[23:19] you are
[23:23] more beautiful
[23:26] than diamonds.
[23:30] And nothing
[23:32] I desire
[23:35] compares
[23:37] within.
[23:44] Nothing
[23:46] I desire
[23:49] compares
[23:51] Lord with thee.
[23:53] [Music]
[24:06] Amen. Let's stand this evening as we get
[24:08] ready to turn the service over to
[24:09] brother Aaron.
[24:12] This probably isn't exactly a song you
[24:14] would welcome the minister out to, but
[24:16] it was on my heart and I couldn't figure
[24:17] out where to put it else in the song
[24:19] list. So, when we all get to heaven,
[24:22] what a day of rejoicing that will be.
[24:25] Amen. Amen.
[24:28] Sing the wondrous love of Jesus. Sing
[24:34] his mercy and his grace
[24:39] in the manions bright and blessed
[24:45] will prepare for us a place
[24:49] when we all
[24:52] get to heaven.
[24:55] What a day rejoicing that will be
[25:01] when we all
[25:04] say Jesus
[25:06] will sing and shout the victory
[25:13] while we walk the pilgrim pathways.
[25:18] Clouds will overspread
[25:22] the sky.
[25:24] But when traveling days are over, not a
[25:31] shadow, not a sigh,
[25:34] when we all
[25:37] get to heaven.
[25:40] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[25:45] when we all
[25:48] see Jesus.
[25:52] Sing and shout the victory.
[25:57] So let us then be true and faithful,
[26:03] trusting, serving
[26:06] every day.
[26:08] Just one glimpse of him in glory will
[26:15] the toss of life repay
[26:19] when we all
[26:22] get to heaven.
[26:24] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[26:30] when we all
[26:33] see Jesus
[26:36] will sing and shout the victory.
[26:41] So onward to the prize before us. Soon
[26:48] his beauty will behold.
[26:53] The pearly gates will open.
[26:59] Shall tread the streets of gold
[27:03] when we all
[27:06] get to heaven.
[27:08] [Music]
[27:17] See Jesus
[27:19] will sing and shout the victory.
[27:25] Oh, when we all
[27:28] get to heaven.
[27:30] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[27:36] when we all
[27:39] see Jesus.
[27:42] will sing and shout the victory.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; How about shouting a little bit of
[27:49] victory right now and praising him.
[27:52] Amen.
[27:53] Amen. Amen. Amen. I appreciate that.
[27:57] Let's just bow our heads here.
[28:01] Lord, we
[28:03] we're looking forward to that day. We're
[28:05] looking forward to that time.
[28:07] [Music]
[28:09] And as since way back, they've been
[28:12] looking for your return, Lord. But every
[28:15] moment and every hour is just that much
[28:17] closer.
[28:19] It could be later today, could be this
[28:22] coming week.
[28:24] But Lord, let us just be prepared all
[28:27] the time.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; So that will not catch us unaware. Lord,
[28:32] thank you for your goodness and your
[28:33] grace, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[28:36] Amen.
[28:38] You may be seated. Thank you.
[28:42] It uh
[28:46] Brother Lyle, is it okay if I borrow 15
[28:48] minutes from your
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. No, we'll we'll do what we can
[28:58] here. Um,
[29:00] I know was talking with uh, Brother Ryan
[29:04] and
[29:06] he said it had been a real real busy
[29:08] week and he hadn't didn't have much time
[29:11] to study.
[29:13] So, he was really going to put in a lot
[29:15] of studying yesterday.
[29:17] In the evening, we had said, "If you get
[29:20] in and you need something to eat, we'll
[29:22] pick you up." and he said, "I just need
[29:23] to get to the to the room and I I just
[29:26] need to seek the Lord."
[29:28] And as humans, we feel unprepared.
[29:33] But we trust in one who knows our every
[29:36] need.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; And sometimes
[29:40] you just need one sentence out of
[29:42] something that's being said, and
[29:43] sometimes you need everything that's
[29:45] being said, but God knows how to take
[29:47] care of that. So, I had mentioned on um
[29:52] this past uh Wednesday night in speaking
[29:55] a little bit with uh with brother Dan
[29:59] and and or texting and and uh he was he
[30:03] told he mentioned to me and maybe to
[30:04] Daniel
[30:06] that he was wellreceived
[30:10] um which is much better than not being
[30:12] received.
[30:13] people giving you strange looks or or
[30:18] falling asleep in service or or walking
[30:20] out on you. But you know when you preach
[30:23] Jesus Christ,
[30:27] there is not anything greater than that.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; And I'll speak to what we call message
[30:35] believers.
[30:37] And many have gotten away from speaking
[30:39] about Jesus Christ and but they speak on
[30:42] whether it's brother Brandham or another
[30:45] great teacher and they spend their time
[30:48] on that and God bless each one of those
[30:51] men that God has given a gift to use.
[30:54] But all the honor and glory goes
[30:56] &gt;&gt; to him
[30:58] &gt;&gt; because he was the only one that could
[31:00] give his life for you and me and it'd be
[31:04] worth it.
[31:06] and he loved you and that's why he gave
[31:08] it to you for you. He said and he cried
[31:11] out as a man so he could be we could
[31:13] know he's he could feel the hurt the
[31:15] disappointment and all when he said
[31:18] father if it is if there's any way we
[31:20] can get around this and me not having to
[31:22] go through what I'm going to go through
[31:25] can it can it pass that way but then he
[31:28] says but not my will be done your will
[31:31] be done
[31:33] and I believe and you should believe
[31:35] that he was thinking about you
[31:37] &gt;&gt; at that time and he said I'll do it for
[31:39] that one. So, I had mentioned it on on
[31:43] uh this this past Wednesday of what's in
[31:46] your cup.
[31:48] And um
[31:52] I know how sometimes the Lord lays on
[31:54] something on me and I may question it,
[31:57] but then he'll confirm it.
[32:00] and um sometimes come and sit down with
[32:03] brother Daniel in the back here and
[32:05] we'll just we'll talk a little bit and
[32:07] he'll say that was what was on my heart
[32:09] or that's what I was reading last night.
[32:12] Um you know and it just um I read this
[32:15] scripture and this is what it meant to
[32:16] me and it just it's just a confirmation
[32:18] that God is watching over us. So,
[32:21] this was um it's two little articles
[32:24] that that came up and I I read them and
[32:26] it just stuck with me probably about a
[32:28] month ago
[32:30] and it's it's called um I call it the
[32:34] cup but and I mentioned you're holding a
[32:37] cup of coffee
[32:39] or could be anything in the cup but it's
[32:41] just coffee when someone comes along and
[32:43] bumps into you or shakes your arm making
[32:47] you spill your coffee everywhere. her.
[32:50] And then the question is, why did you
[32:51] spill the coffee?
[32:53] And they said, "Because someone bumped
[32:55] into me." And he says, "That's the wrong
[32:59] answer.
[33:01] You spilled the cup because there was
[33:03] something in your cup.
[33:07] Had there been nothing in your cup,
[33:09] nothing would have spilled."
[33:11] So he says, "Therefore, when life comes
[33:13] along and shakes you, which will happen,
[33:17] whatever is inside of you will come out.
[33:21] It's easy to fake it until you get
[33:24] rattled."
[33:26] And I think a lot of us can say that's
[33:28] true. This is what I intended to do, but
[33:31] this is what happened.
[33:33] So you have we have to ask ourselves,
[33:35] what's in my cup? When life gets tough,
[33:39] what spills over? Joy,
[33:42] gratitude,
[33:44] peace,
[33:46] humility,
[33:48] or anger, bitterness, victim mentality,
[33:51] and quitting tendencies.
[33:54] Life provides a cup. You choose how to
[33:57] fill it.
[33:59] And it says today's today let's work
[34:01] towards filling our cups with gratitude,
[34:04] forgiveness, joy, words of affirmation,
[34:07] resolence, positivity, kindness,
[34:09] gentleness, and finish with and love for
[34:13] others.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; So as I as I was reading that looking
[34:17] at, I said that whole bottom line speaks
[34:20] about Jesus Christ,
[34:22] &gt;&gt; who he is.
[34:25] So when I say fill my cup, Lord, I'm
[34:27] asking him to dwell in that place.
[34:32] So that was one day. And then this one
[34:34] came up and kind of tied in together. I
[34:38] didn't ask the Lord for something more.
[34:40] It just was there.
[34:42] At a high school reunion, a group of
[34:44] successful alumni, now doctors, lawyers,
[34:47] business owners,
[34:49] decided to visit their favorite teacher.
[34:51] They chatted about their careers and
[34:53] families. But soon the conversation
[34:55] shifted to life's pressure, stress, and
[34:58] the constant chasing after more.
[35:01] After listening a while, their teacher
[35:03] smiled and said, "Hold on a minute. I'll
[35:05] go make us some coffee." He came back
[35:08] with a large pot and a tray full of
[35:10] cups, none of them matching. Some were
[35:13] fine porcelain, others plain ceramic,
[35:17] few were chipped glass mugs, and one
[35:20] even looked like it came from a diner.
[35:24] And I said, ' Man, how did he know why
[35:26] he was there?
[35:28] Sometimes, you know, you're reading and
[35:30] and I appreciate the way God looks at
[35:33] us.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes we look at ourselves
[35:36] differently.
[35:37] And every everyone reached for the cup.
[35:40] The professor watched in silence. Once
[35:42] they all had coffee in hand, he said,
[35:45] "Notice what just happened. Most of you
[35:48] instinctively reach for the nicest cups,
[35:52] leaving behind the simple ones. It's
[35:54] normal to want the best for ourselves,
[35:57] but that's often where the stress
[35:59] begins.
[36:01] He gestered towards the cups. The cup
[36:03] doesn't make the coffee taste any
[36:06] better.
[36:08] What you really wanted was the coffee,
[36:11] but you still focused on the cup. Then
[36:15] he paused. Life is the coffee. Your job,
[36:18] your house, your income, your status,
[36:21] those are just cups. They help contain
[36:23] life, but they don't define it. And the
[36:26] trouble is, the more we focus on the
[36:28] cup, the more we miss out on the coffee.
[36:34] Remember, happy people don't always have
[36:36] the best everything, but they know how
[36:38] to make the best of what they do have.
[36:42] And sometimes you you look over at
[36:45] somebody and they're always seem to be
[36:46] happy. They always seem to be smiling
[36:49] and they always seem to have joy in
[36:51] their heart and a song on and it seems
[36:53] like now if you lived with him all the
[36:56] time, you'd find out they're like you.
[36:59] They have their ups and downs.
[37:02] When the alarm goes off, it's always too
[37:04] early. You know, it's just kind of those
[37:07] things. It's it's kind of how it goes.
[37:10] But in order to spill something, you
[37:11] have to have something in you.
[37:14] You can't give what you don't have. So
[37:19] it and that's that's just the two
[37:20] analogies I brought him. And it made me
[37:23] think of something
[37:27] brother Brandham talks about. I I I sent
[37:30] that quote. They should have it from
[37:33] 530455.
[37:35] Go tell my disciples.
[37:38] And if they have it there, they can put
[37:40] it up. But I'll start reading it. And
[37:43] we've heard this many a times. I used to
[37:45] say about speaking down here about an
[37:47] old spring I used to drink from it. It
[37:50] was bubbling and jumping and jumping and
[37:53] jumping down around Miltown. I used to
[37:56] wonder why that spring jump. So one day
[37:59] I sat down and was talking to it.
[38:01] Imagine a man talking to a spring. But I
[38:04] was talking to nature who made the
[38:06] spring and I wondered what makes you so
[38:09] bubbly, so jumpy
[38:11] is because that the children come and
[38:14] drink from uh drink from you or I drink
[38:17] from you or something. And he says if
[38:20] that the spring could have spoke back,
[38:23] he would say, "No, Billy, it isn't
[38:25] because you drink from it. It isn't
[38:27] because anybody drinks from me. It's
[38:31] something down beneath me here pushing
[38:34] me and making me bumble and jump and
[38:38] carry on like this.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; So what you got inside is going to come
[38:43] out
[38:44] and and and it could be bubbling joy or
[38:47] it could be something else. So that that
[38:50] brought that in and I was talking to
[38:52] brother Daniel and
[38:55] um it just sometimes he'll he'll we'll
[38:57] go in there and we'll meet and we'll
[38:59] talk about taking care of something in
[39:00] service or whatever or something.
[39:02] Sometimes he'll say what would this mean
[39:04] to you or I just read that what you know
[39:06] and we'll share something with each
[39:07] other and I mentioned to that and I said
[39:11] you know and I looked for the quote and
[39:14] brother Brown says this 20 25 times
[39:16] through the message he reuses it quite
[39:18] often
[39:20] but um they put out a quote of the day
[39:23] and I hadn't looked at it for a while um
[39:26] and quote of the day had this exact same
[39:28] quote the same date and the exact same
[39:30] one I was
[39:32] And sometimes God can say, "Yes, I'm
[39:34] with you. Yes, I'm with you. Yes, I'm
[39:36] with you. Yes, I'm with you." And then
[39:38] he'll ask him, "Are you with me?"
[39:42] Or maybe I'm the only one that doesn't,
[39:44] but you know, but they're the simple
[39:45] things that God does to show you that he
[39:48] cares.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; He cares.
[39:51] And he knows who you are. He knows where
[39:53] you live. He knows you by name.
[39:57] He doesn't go, "Hey, brother. uh no you
[39:59] brother there in the front he says
[40:01] brother Jonathan
[40:03] because he knows you by name he knows
[40:05] who you are you know um
[40:09] and so in looking at that it took me to
[40:11] a scripture and we'll start with that
[40:14] Acts 3
[40:17] chapter 3 verses 3-6 and I'm just going
[40:20] to take portions we could read the whole
[40:22] story
[40:24] but this is after the day of Pentecost
[40:26] and brother Brandham speaks quite quite
[40:28] a bit uh just in while they're up there
[40:32] in in the upper room waiting. Jesus had
[40:35] told them, "Go up there and wait till
[40:37] you're endued with power from on high."
[40:40] And there's uh what was there 120 in
[40:43] there?
[40:45] And there was probably 120 opinions.
[40:49] Is it like this? Is it going well ask
[40:50] brother Peter? Well, ask soand so well.
[40:53] You know, and they're just And then one
[40:55] would say, "I think I got And brother
[40:56] Peter said, "No, let's let's wait until
[40:58] we know for sure that there's no
[41:00] question." So then that Holy Spirit
[41:03] comes down and it baptizes them. And you
[41:05] could read all through there the first
[41:06] couple chapters of Acts what it does to
[41:08] them. There was no doubt that there had
[41:11] been a change. They had gone into hiding
[41:14] after he had passed away.
[41:16] Now they're in the upper room and the
[41:18] Holy Spirit comes down and they come out
[41:20] and say, "We're going to tell everybody
[41:21] about this." Yeah. So, Acts 3:3-6
[41:27] and now he's they're walking over to the
[41:29] temple. That's another thing I
[41:30] appreciate that that's in the
[41:31] scriptures. Now that we got the Holy
[41:34] Ghost, we're not going to that church.
[41:35] We're not going to go. No, no, they went
[41:37] back to the temple.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; It didn't take lead them away from that.
[41:42] They went back to worship there, you
[41:44] know. And so, who seen Peter and John?
[41:48] They're talking to that that man that
[41:49] they found on on the side who was lame.
[41:51] And he said, "Who seeing Peter and John
[41:53] about to go into the temple asked for
[41:55] alms?" And Peter fastening his eyes upon
[41:59] him with John said, "Look on us."
[42:03] You know, don't hold your head down.
[42:04] Come see who you're talking to. See
[42:06] who's there. And he says, "And he gave
[42:09] heed to them, expecting to receive
[42:12] something of them, something physical,
[42:14] some money, some food, something that he
[42:17] could." Then Peter said, "Silver and
[42:20] gold have I none. I didn't get rich
[42:23] because I got the Holy Ghost. I didn't
[42:25] get rich because I came a Christian. I
[42:27] got something much better than that. I
[42:30] got something eternal out of this. But
[42:33] such as I have, and that's the key, such
[42:37] as I have,
[42:39] I give thee in the name of Jesus Christ
[42:42] of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
[42:48] And he didn't say, "Now, because I'm
[42:49] Peter, I'm going to be the first uh
[42:52] pope, I'm gonna be the best." No, he
[42:53] said, "Because I've got Jesus Christ
[42:55] living in me, and I can give you him
[42:58] &gt;&gt; and he is life."
[43:00] So, you know, a couple couple of
[43:04] references here. Luke 5 37-39.
[43:10] And this is a story when Jesus had gone
[43:13] and and he found the man with the the
[43:16] thousand demons in him, you know.
[43:20] And so
[43:22] after that it had it happened and they
[43:23] cast out. He had cast the demon into the
[43:27] pigs, the pigs, you know. And and it
[43:29] tells you here the people told him,
[43:31] "Leave us. Go away."
[43:34] I I would hope that in that situation I
[43:36] would see God do something like that.
[43:38] Jesus, I would say, "I've got some
[43:40] things that I want out."
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; And if he can do that, he could do that
[43:44] for me.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes
[43:49] we we we
[43:51] I I saw a miracle happen in this church
[43:53] one day many years ago. I I I was there
[43:56] when it happened.
[43:58] And yet I watched it happen. It was an
[44:01] amazing thing to happen. And yet
[44:03] sometimes I still wonder, God, can you
[44:05] do this?
[44:08] Yet he had shown me he can. He's shown
[44:09] it. How many can testify if you've seen
[44:12] God do something miraculous, wonderful?
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Can he do it again?
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Then why sometimes is it so difficult?
[44:21] Because we start looking at ourselves.
[44:24] So now verse 37,
[44:26] after he had cast the demons into the
[44:29] pigs, they had thrown themselves. Then
[44:30] the whole multitude of the country of
[44:32] the gatherines roundabout besought him
[44:34] to depart from them. for they were taken
[44:37] with great fear, and he went up into the
[44:39] ship and returned back again.
[44:42] Now the man out of whom the devils were
[44:44] departed besought him that he might be
[44:47] with him. But Jesus sent him away,
[44:49] saying, "Return to thine own house, and
[44:53] show how great things God has done unto
[44:55] thee." And he went his way, and
[44:58] published throughout the whole city how
[45:01] great things Jesus had done unto him.
[45:05] Now what he had in his cup, he took it
[45:07] to somebody else.
[45:10] Not this is my cup and it's precious and
[45:12] God gave it to me and it's for me only.
[45:16] No, what you have now is to give.
[45:21] So the thought is in here, what is in
[45:23] your cup?
[45:26] And sometimes we get more worried about
[45:28] what the cup looks like like the second
[45:31] one was. How beautiful the cup is. I
[45:34] dress like a Christian. I act like a
[45:36] Christian. I speak like a Christian. I
[45:38] do this like a Christian. But what comes
[45:41] out of the cup isn't always Christian.
[45:46] Um
[45:49] sometimes um you know,
[45:53] we'll just go down home here. Maybe uh
[45:56] your brother, your sister, your husband,
[45:59] your wife, your children, whoever does
[46:03] something and they make you upset
[46:09] and something
[46:12] that was in your cup comes out
[46:16] and then you go, "Oh my, that shouldn't
[46:18] have come out." Honestly, it should
[46:21] have.
[46:22] so it can be exposed so you can see,
[46:25] hey, I need some work on this.
[46:29] But also, what if you're around some
[46:31] folks, maybe some of your workers or
[46:33] maybe somebody your co-workers, you're
[46:35] in school, uh, Brother Daniel there with
[46:38] with uh, you know what, all your
[46:40] training and all and um, you know, you
[46:43] being brother Daniel Evans son, I'm sure
[46:45] you you've never caused them any your
[46:47] mom's not here to verify that, but
[46:50] &gt;&gt; never never except when you're awake.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. That's where most of
[46:55] the problems happen. But you know we do
[46:57] have our our days those things do happen
[47:00] and and somebody sees you something
[47:03] happened with you uh somebody speaks
[47:05] evil something blames you something and
[47:08] your reaction to that is it's okay it's
[47:12] all right I forgive you
[47:15] that has an amazing effect
[47:18] it has an amazing effect they have to
[47:20] somebody has to make a decision on how
[47:22] they're going to receive that
[47:24] and and uh and Things happen all the
[47:27] time. We go through different things.
[47:31] Um, you get somebody wants to cut in
[47:33] front of you in line and they don't stop
[47:36] and ask you. They just do it
[47:39] and you lost seven seconds.
[47:45] Never recover them again.
[47:48] You know, sometimes, you know, we laugh
[47:50] about, but sometimes we act that way.
[47:53] But you know, there was one, and he
[47:56] still lives today,
[47:58] who said, "Father, forgive them. They
[48:00] don't know what they're doing."
[48:03] While he's being tormented, while he's
[48:06] being uh the very ones who had said they
[48:09] were waiting for the Messiah,
[48:12] they had kept the word. They had done
[48:14] all this. They're waiting. And God gives
[48:16] them a Messiah, and they reject him.
[48:20] How could you be the Messiah? He would
[48:22] have come this way. He would have come
[48:24] that way. He would have done this. He
[48:26] would have done that. And you know,
[48:29] sometimes they might look at you and
[48:32] I've done this. You've probably done it.
[48:34] You have a picture of a Christian in
[48:35] your mind,
[48:37] whether it's a sister or a brother, a
[48:39] family, however it is, and this is how
[48:42] they should look and this is how they
[48:45] should act.
[48:47] And you know, I I've said this again and
[48:49] I'll I'll say it again. said it before.
[48:53] The mirror only reflects what is looking
[48:56] into it, what it's seeing. It's not the
[48:59] mirror's fault.
[49:02] I say that quite often. I tell my wife,
[49:04] "Why did you put this ugly picture in
[49:06] the bathroom?"
[49:08] And she goes and looks at and she said,
[49:10] "Because it's beautiful."
[49:12] And we have an argument over it. Every
[49:14] time I look at it, it's not.
[49:17] You know, it's just and and you know,
[49:19] that just brings out something. But you
[49:22] know, Christ looks at you through his
[49:24] shed blood.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; And he sees you not in all your faults,
[49:30] your failures, your mistakes, but he
[49:32] sees what he did for you. And he
[49:35] cleansed you and he washed you and he
[49:37] made you whole.
[49:39] Now, he knows you're going to make a
[49:42] mistake. He knows you're going to fail.
[49:43] He knows things are going to come out of
[49:45] your cup when you get bumped.
[49:47] But he makes a provision for taking care
[49:50] of that. We get very concerned at times
[49:53] of what the outer part of the cup looks.
[49:56] And I know that if there's a dirty cup
[49:59] and a clean cup on the exterior sitting
[50:02] there, I'm always going to go get the
[50:04] clean cup.
[50:06] But I'm talking exterior.
[50:09] And I rarely ever look down inside the
[50:12] cup. I just grab the clean cup, assuming
[50:15] it's all clean. and then I'll go put
[50:17] what I want in it.
[50:20] You can accidentally drink Clorox that
[50:23] way
[50:25] and you'll know when you drank it. Okay?
[50:28] You can end up doing something without
[50:31] looking at it. What is it? And the same
[50:33] thing with each one of us. We should
[50:35] look closely at ourselves. Why did that
[50:38] come out of me?
[50:40] Where was that? And why did it come out?
[50:44] Now again, Peter said, "Such as I have."
[50:48] But about 120 days before that,
[50:52] Peter says, "I don't know him.
[50:56] I've never seen him." Says he even
[50:59] cursed.
[51:00] And he told, "Let's just go back to
[51:02] fishing. Obviously, this wasn't true."
[51:07] And Jesus comes back and he sees he
[51:10] calls his disciples. Now, he has risen.
[51:13] And I love these words. Go call my
[51:16] disciples and tell them, "Oh, and Peter
[51:20] too."
[51:21] Peter also
[51:24] because you made a mistake, because you
[51:26] failed, because your cup got dirty,
[51:29] doesn't cancel you out. God can clean it
[51:33] and fill it with that which is good.
[51:35] Peter who we just went through a the
[51:38] world just saw a new pope and they say
[51:40] well you know Peter was the first and so
[51:43] no Peter was not the pope Peter was a
[51:46] man that needed salvation Peter was a
[51:48] man that needed change in fact after the
[51:50] Holy Ghost fell on all of them Peter and
[51:54] it comes in and and he they're feeding
[51:56] there and they're having and then Paul
[51:58] comes in and the Gala the uh uh not
[52:01] Galatians but the uh what's the other
[52:05] the non-Jews, I'm sorry, come walking
[52:08] in. And Peter gets up and he walks over
[52:09] and goes to the other side. And Paul has
[52:12] to call him out and says, "You
[52:13] hypocrite, you were eating with them a
[52:15] bit ago. And when you see the Jewish
[52:17] brother coming, you ran to the other
[52:18] side."
[52:20] But God didn't send him to hell for
[52:22] that. God just said, "I care for you,
[52:24] Peter, and I straightened you out." So
[52:26] when we come back and say, "Lord, here's
[52:28] my cup. Put in my cup." What would help
[52:32] somebody else? would help me.
[52:37] But I've never asked them for a specific
[52:39] cup. The cup needs to look like this.
[52:45] Just want a clean cup. They all do the
[52:48] same thing. They all hold whatever you
[52:51] put in there.
[52:54] It does. The exterior does not change
[52:56] what's on the inside.
[52:59] But if you pour into a dirty cup on the
[53:03] inside, it changes what you're pouring
[53:05] into it.
[53:06] It may no longer be drinkable. It may no
[53:10] long. So Lord, here's my cup, Lord. I
[53:13] lift it up. Clean it out.
[53:16] Now, so
[53:21] so he he tells again he tells him, "Go
[53:25] and tell others, show others what God
[53:28] has done for you."
[53:30] And and uh in Psalm 16:2,
[53:35] I I was looking at some scriptures and
[53:37] just just
[53:40] you can't go wrong with the scriptures,
[53:43] you know. I I know that sometimes those
[53:45] that have been around in the message for
[53:46] quite quite some time, we want to hear a
[53:49] hundred quotes.
[53:51] Well, as I was looking for this quote
[53:53] about the the spring water, Brother
[53:55] Brandham quoted it over and over and
[53:57] over, but it didn't change the quote. It
[54:00] was you could have said it once and you
[54:01] said the same thing. I'm not against
[54:03] that, but sometime God's word is what
[54:06] brother Brandon based all of what he
[54:08] said
[54:09] &gt;&gt; on God's word. So I can go to God's word
[54:12] and know it does not fail. Psalm 16:2,
[54:16] "My soul, my soul, thou hast said unto
[54:19] the Lord, thou art my Lord, my goodness
[54:24] extendeth not to thee." So I was looking
[54:27] at that because sometimes in in the
[54:29] translation you look at, okay, what's he
[54:31] talking about? So I looked it up and
[54:34] I'll just be honest with you now that
[54:35] brother Daniel has been using I've gone
[54:37] and looked at him because I've had
[54:39] questions I didn't know what it meant
[54:41] and if you were just taking a moment to
[54:43] look at the okay that answer is that and
[54:47] I'm still a Christian.
[54:50] Oh my soul you have said to the Lord you
[54:53] are my Lord I have no good but you.
[54:58] This is David looking at himself and
[55:00] said, "My goodness is yours in me, not
[55:04] my own goodness." So it it is what he we
[55:08] allow him to put in our cups.
[55:13] Here's my cup, Lord. Fill it up with
[55:16] this, please. Here's my other cup, Lord.
[55:19] Fill it up with this, please.
[55:23] And the Lord is saying, "Why don't you
[55:24] let me fill it up with what you need
[55:27] from me?" Because I I know it. It's kind
[55:29] of like a child wanting this, wanting
[55:32] that. Um, and as a parent, you say, "No,
[55:35] you can't get a machine gun at three
[55:38] years old."
[55:39] But, but, but, but, oh, wait, I'll do it
[55:41] this way. But, grandpa or Papa, I need
[55:44] it.
[55:46] Because mom and dad will say no. And
[55:47] papa just might say yes.
[55:50] But you know, God knows what's best for
[55:53] us.
[55:54] And in Proverbs 18:4,
[55:59] so what comes out, we're getting into a
[56:02] little bit of what's coming out. The
[56:04] words of a man's mouth are as deep
[56:06] waters. And the wellspring of wisdom is
[56:10] as a flowing brook.
[56:12] So as I would look at that, the words of
[56:15] a man's mouth are as deep waters.
[56:16] Sometimes we I to me it's we're trying
[56:19] to impress. We're trying to get into
[56:20] deep things. We're trying to
[56:23] um
[56:24] let me just say a little experience what
[56:26] with I had with a brother who had his
[56:29] arms up high and was talking
[56:32] about his experiences up like this.
[56:34] Never looked down and everything. I had
[56:37] no clue what he was trying to say. Just
[56:40] going down and this that and the other.
[56:43] And he said, "So, brother, what do you
[56:45] think about that?
[56:48] I'll just be honest."
[56:50] I said, 'I think you're nuts. And I
[56:53] walked away.
[56:55] Now, I look back and I say, "Why did I
[56:58] say that?" He was just garbling. Just
[57:01] garbling. Just garbling. And the
[57:03] mountains and the revelation and nothing
[57:05] made sense.
[57:07] And it wasn't until that long after that
[57:09] that this man had just gone out into the
[57:11] world. But he seemed to be receiving
[57:14] revelation from heaven.
[57:17] Wise words are like deep waters.
[57:20] Wisdom flows from the wise like a
[57:23] bubbling brook.
[57:25] Something simple, something sweet. And
[57:29] he says,
[57:31] so I said, Lord, my words don't have to
[57:34] be so deep in the word that nobody can
[57:37] understand it, but it sounds so
[57:38] spiritual, so everybody's jumping up and
[57:39] down and shouting.
[57:42] But really tomorrow it doesn't help you
[57:43] a bit because you didn't even know what
[57:45] they said. And I'm saying that by
[57:48] experience.
[57:51] Psalms 30 verse 5. And I'm going to go
[57:54] to a point with this here. Come in with
[57:57] this. Psalms 30:5.
[58:02] But his anger endureth but a moment. And
[58:05] his favor is life.
[58:08] Weeping may endure for a night, but joy
[58:11] cometh in the morning.
[58:14] You know,
[58:17] you can have something
[58:20] um not good in your cup,
[58:24] but maybe it was your cup you said in
[58:27] and this is an experience that actually
[58:29] happened. The mom put some bleach in a
[58:32] cup and set it on the table.
[58:36] And this happened with my father and
[58:39] another brother ministering to a family
[58:41] who had just heard about the message and
[58:43] they were getting ready to move up to
[58:45] South Dakota. And this brother was down
[58:47] from South Dakota. So my dad took him
[58:49] over to meet them. And all a sudden his
[58:53] older brother comes running and mom
[58:56] just drank that bleach that cup with
[58:58] bleach in it. So my dad, I don't
[59:01] remember the brother's name now, but
[59:02] they went over to where he was, and he
[59:04] was frothing out of the mouth.
[59:08] And they had just been telling him about
[59:11] a living God who was the same yesterday,
[59:14] today, and forever. And they both
[59:16] stopped and prayed for him, and it
[59:18] disappeared. And like he had never drank
[59:20] it.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; But you and I can't tell him when to do
[59:27] it and how to do it.
[59:29] We just have to say, "Fill my cup,
[59:31] Lord."
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Because you know what's going to be
[59:33] needed when it's going to be needed.
[59:36] Now, if they would have said, "Now, wait
[59:37] a minute. Wait a minute. You need to
[59:39] believe this message before we pray for
[59:41] him. You have to have this
[59:42] understanding." The little boy would
[59:44] have died.
[59:46] But if you just said, "I serve a God.
[59:48] I'll show you he's a living God."
[59:53] Now,
[59:55] some of us parents,
[59:58] um, maybe some of these things,
[1:00:01] especially for those of us raised in
[1:00:03] church, which most of us here have been
[1:00:06] raised in church, we've heard the
[1:00:09] message, we've heard the gospel, we've
[1:00:10] heard this over and over,
[1:00:13] but until each one has their own
[1:00:15] experience,
[1:00:18] they can't live off of yours. you. Each
[1:00:21] one has to have their own. My car can be
[1:00:24] full of t of gas
[1:00:27] and the neighbors cannot might not have
[1:00:30] gas or the other way around. And if
[1:00:33] theirs is full of gas and I try to start
[1:00:35] mine without it, it's not going to start
[1:00:36] because theirs is full of gas. It's got
[1:00:39] to be in mine. Now, I can rejoice with
[1:00:43] someone because they've got a blessing,
[1:00:46] but I can't give their blessing to
[1:00:48] somebody else because it's in their cup.
[1:00:52] Now, I asked brother Daniel about this,
[1:00:55] and I'm going to take a little bit of
[1:00:57] liberty.
[1:00:59] 1 Timothy 4:1
[1:01:03] and it's it's
[1:01:06] let no man despise thy youth
[1:01:09] but be an example
[1:01:12] but but be thou an example of the
[1:01:14] believers in word in conversation in
[1:01:17] charity in spirit in faith in purity.
[1:01:24] So, uh, here's let no one make little of
[1:01:26] you because you are young, but be an
[1:01:30] example to the church in word and
[1:01:32] behavior and love and faith and holy
[1:01:34] living.
[1:01:35] And I was talking to brother Dan. I
[1:01:37] said, could I take that word youth
[1:01:40] and say someone new
[1:01:43] in the gospel?
[1:01:45] And he said, you know what? I don't
[1:01:48] think that's what he meant, but yes, you
[1:01:50] could. You're young. You're new in the
[1:01:53] gospel.
[1:01:55] And new in the gospel means you've just
[1:01:57] come in. You're just learning.
[1:02:00] And you know how you learn? By
[1:02:02] experience. And you know how you get
[1:02:04] experience? By doing it.
[1:02:07] I know I brother Daniel was saying
[1:02:10] you're about a year away from
[1:02:13] um
[1:02:15] what will you be doing?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; I just want to be sure that I'm going to
[1:02:20] another doctor then. No, just kidding.
[1:02:22] I I don't know that I want the doctor
[1:02:24] and said, you know, you're my first
[1:02:25] patient, but I've had plenty of plenty
[1:02:27] of schooling till today. You know,
[1:02:28] today's my first. No.
[1:02:31] Uh we'll trust that when you when you're
[1:02:34] ready, you're ready. Amen. But you know,
[1:02:36] experience means something.
[1:02:39] Experience means something. It means
[1:02:41] that you've learned through
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; working through it, going through it. It
[1:02:46] doesn't say only a good experience is
[1:02:49] good. You learn from bad experiences,
[1:02:51] too. they learn not to do it again.
[1:02:54] You know, some of us take longer to
[1:02:56] learn, some learn quicker, but you do
[1:02:58] learn. And some of you looked at each
[1:03:00] other when I said that. But but you
[1:03:04] learn
[1:03:05] you you get into class and I had uh my
[1:03:11] two first cousins I was in high school
[1:03:13] with with and and being in algebra.
[1:03:17] I I think I know you've had to go
[1:03:19] through all of that but I wasn't u
[1:03:22] aspiring to be a doctor or anything like
[1:03:23] that. So general math was good enough.
[1:03:27] Well, I would I we would be working side
[1:03:30] by side and one of my brother-in-laws,
[1:03:33] first cousin who also married my wife,
[1:03:36] sister, brother-in-law, first cousin,
[1:03:37] however you want to make that. And he
[1:03:39] would just go, "It's that, it's that,
[1:03:41] it's this, it's this." And for the next
[1:03:44] 45 minutes, I was still working on that
[1:03:46] first one, trying to figure it out. I
[1:03:49] didn't think it was fair. Okay? But he
[1:03:52] knew what he's doing. Now, what ended up
[1:03:55] happening
[1:03:58] at the end of our senior year and they
[1:04:01] gave out the awards, his name was called
[1:04:03] out in front of the whole school.
[1:04:07] And I'm just going to call him Bob, but
[1:04:09] he wasn't Bob. Okay? And Bob so and so,
[1:04:13] who could have been number one in this
[1:04:18] math thing, just it got too easy for
[1:04:21] him, so he quit doing him doing it. So
[1:04:23] he gets no award.
[1:04:27] And I thought, really to myself, you had
[1:04:31] the the possibility of being recognized
[1:04:33] that, but because it was too easy, you
[1:04:35] got bored with it, you quit doing it.
[1:04:38] And I thought to myself, don't ever let
[1:04:40] me be that way with you, Lord.
[1:04:43] Don't ever let me feel I know it all. I
[1:04:46] don't need to deal with it. Let me be
[1:04:50] humble and sweet. just always reminded
[1:04:52] me that it just just didn't do it. But
[1:04:57] again, and I'm I'm going to do it this
[1:04:59] way. Let no man despise thy youth, but
[1:05:02] I'm going to say new in the gospel.
[1:05:06] And I talked to brother Dan. He said,
[1:05:07] "Yeah, use that." Someone in their youth
[1:05:09] in the gospel.
[1:05:13] Some of us have been there many years,
[1:05:14] some are new. Put your arm around them
[1:05:17] and lead by example.
[1:05:22] I remember when we first came into the
[1:05:25] message, all of us thought that we had
[1:05:27] to be able to preach the message. And if
[1:05:30] we found ourselves preaching the message
[1:05:32] but not living the message
[1:05:36] and they weren't listening to your
[1:05:40] words, they were watching how you were
[1:05:42] living.
[1:05:44] That was what was in your cup.
[1:05:47] But remember, somebody new in the gospel
[1:05:49] is also looking at those of us who have
[1:05:52] been in the gospel longer,
[1:05:54] have learned by experience, have grown
[1:05:56] in the Lord.
[1:05:58] What does our cup look like? If they
[1:06:01] came to drink out of my cup, would it be
[1:06:03] pleasant? Would it be something good to
[1:06:06] drink? Would it be I'm better than you?
[1:06:08] I'm greater than you. Wait till you get
[1:06:10] to my status.
[1:06:12] No, it should be living water in that
[1:06:15] cup. Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:21] Now,
[1:06:24] Brother Dan made a made made a a couple
[1:06:26] of statements or comments to me. He
[1:06:28] said, "When you minister,
[1:06:32] um, and and Brother Green used to do the
[1:06:34] same thing." He would say, "Make sure
[1:06:36] it's helping. Make sure it's don't don't
[1:06:39] ever get to a point where you're
[1:06:41] preaching way above everybody because
[1:06:42] you're trying to preach your great
[1:06:43] revelation. give them something they can
[1:06:47] apply in their life, something they can
[1:06:49] use,
[1:06:50] you know, um if you got a flat tire on
[1:06:53] the side of the road, you don't need a
[1:06:56] doctor to stop by and tell you what's
[1:07:00] wrong with your body when you need to
[1:07:02] fix a flat tire. You need somebody
[1:07:04] that's got a pump with him, has done it
[1:07:07] before, something to take the rock the
[1:07:10] tire off. That's what you need right
[1:07:11] there.
[1:07:13] Well, sometimes we want to tell
[1:07:14] everybody what we know and how much we
[1:07:17] have when really all they need is a cup
[1:07:19] of water.
[1:07:21] And that cup of water would speak a
[1:07:22] whole lot more than so sometimes it's
[1:07:26] simple and it says here fathers Proverbs
[1:07:32] 18:4s
[1:07:36] do not provoke your children to anger by
[1:07:39] the way you treat them.
[1:07:41] rather bring them up in this discipline
[1:07:44] and instruction that comes from the
[1:07:47] Lord.
[1:07:50] Um
[1:07:52] probably could ask all of you that have
[1:07:55] were raised in church as a child and
[1:07:58] your parents sat you in the f right in
[1:08:00] front of them
[1:08:02] like where brother John is here. I would
[1:08:05] be right in the front of brother John
[1:08:08] and if my head nodded like I was falling
[1:08:10] asleep. I got one of those right here.
[1:08:13] Anybody else?
[1:08:16] To keep us awake. It kept us awake, but
[1:08:19] it didn't make me want to be around my
[1:08:21] dad that much at that time.
[1:08:23] And I understand it. I was not at an age
[1:08:25] to learn yet. But there came a time a
[1:08:28] little further down the road that my dad
[1:08:29] sat down with me, put his arm around me,
[1:08:32] and said, "This is why, son.
[1:08:35] This is why, son. Because of this. This
[1:08:39] is where we learn. This is how we
[1:08:40] receive. Okay? And sometimes we look at
[1:08:44] our children. Why are they acting? Why
[1:08:46] are you acting like that? He goes,
[1:08:47] because I've been watching you, dad or
[1:08:49] mom.
[1:08:50] I've watched your reaction.
[1:08:53] And if you can do it, I can do it, too.
[1:08:57] Because that's what came out of your
[1:08:58] cup.
[1:09:00] I remember that. I've shared it before.
[1:09:02] Maybe some of the folks hadn't here. It
[1:09:04] was
[1:09:05] we were talking to some young married
[1:09:07] couples and stuff like that. kind of one
[1:09:09] of the things we said once you have
[1:09:11] children if and I know this never
[1:09:13] happened to any of you it's husband and
[1:09:16] wife got into a little bit of this or
[1:09:18] that you know little bit of this or that
[1:09:20] and the kids saw it
[1:09:24] and then the husband and wife went and
[1:09:28] they they made it right in the room and
[1:09:31] the kids didn't see that.
[1:09:35] Okay.
[1:09:37] So I would tell them learn by learning
[1:09:39] by experience. Make it right in front of
[1:09:42] your children.
[1:09:44] Ask for forgiveness
[1:09:47] and they will learn a lesson from that.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:09:54] my wife said, "Please don't say that cuz
[1:09:56] and I said, "Oh, and by the way, it's a
[1:09:57] lot cheaper because then you don't have
[1:09:58] to buy her shoes and a new dress."
[1:10:01] And she would say, "Don't say that
[1:10:03] because they they're going to think that
[1:10:05] she's never done that to me.
[1:10:07] I've made her mad, but she's never made
[1:10:09] me pay back that way. A restaurant
[1:10:12] maybe, but no. But see, I get to eat,
[1:10:15] too. So, it's works both ways. But I I
[1:10:18] just shared that with a young a couple
[1:10:21] and all a sudden one day the brother
[1:10:22] pulled me goes, "You know, that really
[1:10:24] works. Me and my wife got into a little
[1:10:27] bit of squabble."
[1:10:29] And I asked her to forgive me right in
[1:10:31] front of my son and my daughter. And my
[1:10:34] son came back and said, "Daddy, I
[1:10:36] learned something from that.
[1:10:39] Something good came out of that cup.
[1:10:42] Something that somebody got a lesson out
[1:10:44] of."
[1:10:47] So again, bring them up with the
[1:10:51] discipline and instruction that comes
[1:10:53] from the Lord.
[1:10:56] I I I I say this.
[1:11:00] I have never been whipped by the Lord. I
[1:11:04] have never been screamed at by the Lord.
[1:11:06] I have never been yelled at by the Lord.
[1:11:09] I have never been kicked by the Lord. I
[1:11:11] have never been run over by the Lord.
[1:11:13] I'm just going to an extreme.
[1:11:16] He has done this a few times, has done
[1:11:19] that a few time to get my attention,
[1:11:23] but he's never destroyed me. He's never
[1:11:25] made me lose my confidence in him.
[1:11:29] But he has said, "Son, I care for you. I
[1:11:31] love you. Daughter, this is why I'm
[1:11:34] saying that
[1:11:36] because there's a lesson to learn.
[1:11:40] If I who bared your sins upon my body
[1:11:44] and I was crucified and do it and I
[1:11:47] could do this for you, you can do the
[1:11:49] same."
[1:11:51] Lord, forgive them. They know not what
[1:11:53] they're doing.
[1:11:55] And it it is the things that you learn
[1:11:58] by experience.
[1:12:02] Experience is a good teacher.
[1:12:05] Good experiences are a better teacher.
[1:12:08] Okay. So again
[1:12:11] again do not provoke your children to
[1:12:14] anger by the way you treat them.
[1:12:17] Rather bring them up with a discipline
[1:12:19] instruction that comes from the Lord.
[1:12:22] And when it comes from the Lord, let it
[1:12:24] be lived through your life.
[1:12:31] Now watch now, we're not going to be too
[1:12:32] much longer here.
[1:12:35] We're coming here,
[1:12:40] okay? The the scriptures here. Matthew
[1:12:44] 25:34
[1:12:45] to 40. And we'll go through it quickly.
[1:12:49] Fathers, do not provoke provoke your
[1:12:51] children. I'm sorry, wrong one. Then
[1:12:54] shall the king say unto them on his
[1:12:56] right hand, come ye blessed of my
[1:12:58] father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for
[1:13:01] you from the foundation of the world.
[1:13:04] For I was a hungered and you gave me
[1:13:06] meat. I was thirsty and you gave me
[1:13:09] drink. I was a stranger and you took me
[1:13:11] in. Naked and you clothed me. I was sick
[1:13:14] and you visited me. I was in prison and
[1:13:17] ye ye came unto me.
[1:13:20] Then shall the righteous answer him and
[1:13:22] saying, Lord, when did we see you
[1:13:26] hungered and fed thee? Or thirsty and
[1:13:29] gave thee drink? When saw we thee as a
[1:13:34] stranger, and took thee, or naked, and
[1:13:35] clothed thee? Or when we saw we uh thee
[1:13:40] sick, or in prison, and in came and came
[1:13:43] unto thee? And the king shall answer and
[1:13:45] say unto them, verily, verily, I say
[1:13:47] unto you, in as much as you have done it
[1:13:50] unto one of these, the least of these my
[1:13:54] brethren, ye have done it unto me.
[1:13:59] So understand how we treat one another
[1:14:02] is how we treat God.
[1:14:07] Oh, I would never do that. But if you're
[1:14:09] doing to one of his children, you're
[1:14:10] doing it to him.
[1:14:13] And how do you know your neighbor is not
[1:14:15] one of his children?
[1:14:18] Do we know that?
[1:14:21] There was a time that we probably didn't
[1:14:22] look like one of God's children, but
[1:14:25] somebody reached out their hand to you
[1:14:27] and I. You know what? On that day,
[1:14:31] crossing over, your neighbor walks over
[1:14:33] with you and you look and you're here.
[1:14:35] Yes. Because you remember you did this
[1:14:37] for me and I'm here today. It will be
[1:14:40] worth it all. it will be worth it all.
[1:14:45] He that's that's Jesus saying what you
[1:14:47] do unto others you're doing it unto me.
[1:14:50] So again I say what's in your cup that's
[1:14:53] what you can give.
[1:14:55] We judge the cup by the outside a lot of
[1:14:58] times. It was a beautiful cup that I put
[1:15:00] this mess in,
[1:15:04] you know, or I would say the cup didn't
[1:15:07] look pretty outside, but what was in it
[1:15:10] was good.
[1:15:14] And I I've said this, I'll say this one
[1:15:16] more time, maybe a lot more times than
[1:15:18] one more time, but tonight, one more
[1:15:21] time. To forgive is to liberate a
[1:15:24] prisoner.
[1:15:27] And to discover that the prisoner was
[1:15:30] you
[1:15:34] a prisoner to what you're holding
[1:15:35] against somebody else.
[1:15:38] It clouds your judgment. It clouds your
[1:15:41] feelings.
[1:15:43] And when you give what's in your cup,
[1:15:46] they look at and say, "I don't want it."
[1:15:53] What will you do with the issue,
[1:15:55] struggles, problems,
[1:15:58] temptations that come your way? And they
[1:16:01] will.
[1:16:04] How many raise their hand if you had
[1:16:05] some problems, some troubles, some
[1:16:07] things that if you could do them all
[1:16:09] over again, you would.
[1:16:11] But they come your way for a lesson.
[1:16:14] They come your way to be able to help
[1:16:16] somebody else through that, for you to
[1:16:18] grow.
[1:16:19] God would never send anything your way
[1:16:21] that you cannot overcome or he won't
[1:16:23] overcome for you.
[1:16:29] We are being observed by those around us
[1:16:33] at home,
[1:16:34] at work, at church, school, and when we
[1:16:40] are out and about.
[1:16:43] You're being watched. Especially you
[1:16:45] sisters who dress as true Christian
[1:16:48] sisters.
[1:16:49] And I'm not your judge.
[1:16:52] I don't put a measuring tape and said
[1:16:53] it's got to be like this, like that.
[1:16:55] That's the work of God in your life.
[1:16:59] But somebody may look at you and and and
[1:17:03] you look they look at you and they're
[1:17:05] going like, "Why are they doing that?"
[1:17:07] And I've had this question asked, "Can
[1:17:09] can they even have any fun?
[1:17:12] Can Can they climb up on the rocks? Can
[1:17:15] they go hiking dressed like that? How
[1:17:18] many sisters have gone hiking dressed
[1:17:20] like you are?
[1:17:22] All of you came back, so I guess it was
[1:17:24] all right.
[1:17:25] But you didn't have to change
[1:17:28] for that. You were a testimony while
[1:17:30] you're going out there amongst others.
[1:17:33] I've told you about the experiences we
[1:17:35] had when we were up in Yellowstone
[1:17:38] on a trip my dad took us when we were
[1:17:40] kids and in I I'm sure it's still the
[1:17:43] same. You can't stay in a tent because
[1:17:46] of the bears and we saw some of them and
[1:17:49] no, I don't want to stay in a tent.
[1:17:51] There's some big guys there and I heard
[1:17:53] a lot of them like Mexican food. So,
[1:17:55] hey, let's let's stop right there. But
[1:17:58] no, so the man was probably maybe from
[1:18:02] here to the end of the church. she was
[1:18:03] building. So, dad went over to talk to
[1:18:06] him
[1:18:07] and uh he was from Israel. His English
[1:18:11] was not the best and my dad's English
[1:18:13] was not the best. I really don't know
[1:18:14] how they conversed,
[1:18:17] but somehow he got to understanding that
[1:18:20] this man had come back to start calling
[1:18:22] his brethren back home to Israel.
[1:18:26] They're re, you know, our Messiah's
[1:18:28] coming. I'm trying to get them to come
[1:18:29] back. And this was in 1972.
[1:18:32] So me and my younger brother get up
[1:18:34] close and my dad turn around and this is
[1:18:36] my brother, my son Aaron. And he goes,
[1:18:38] "Moses's brother. Praise God."
[1:18:43] Well, thank you, Lord, for that. My
[1:18:46] other brother, Jerry, and he goes,
[1:18:47] "Jeremiah, the prophet of God." you
[1:18:50] know, so it opened a door for him to
[1:18:53] come over and eat with us in the in the
[1:18:56] uh my mom was cooking in the tra in the
[1:18:59] mobile trailer we had and all and she's
[1:19:01] making tortillas a good old Mexican
[1:19:04] staple and he says, "Pat the bread from
[1:19:08] home." I said, "My goodness, is there
[1:19:10] anything this guy doesn't see?" You
[1:19:11] know, and we had a wonderful time. He
[1:19:14] sang some songs back to us in in the
[1:19:18] Israeli language. the original songs
[1:19:20] from the Psalms. They had kept it, kept
[1:19:23] it, kept it and kept it, you know, and
[1:19:26] there. So, it was a wonderful time
[1:19:27] there. We leave, we end up at the Grand
[1:19:31] Canyon. It was a long trip. It was a
[1:19:32] month trip through Canon and all the way
[1:19:34] back down. And we come to the South Rim
[1:19:36] and we go down on a hike, my father and
[1:19:38] me and my brother. And this man's name
[1:19:41] was Gideon. Surprising Israeli. Gideon
[1:19:45] goes together. He's got a hiking hat.
[1:19:48] He's with shorts. He's got his
[1:19:49] sunglasses on. We walked right past him
[1:19:53] without saying that couldn't be G with
[1:19:54] saying that couldn't be Gideon because
[1:19:56] he was dressed totally differently.
[1:19:59] We're dressed the same and my dad is
[1:20:01] whistling one of the songs that we had
[1:20:03] done that was a psalm.
[1:20:06] And Gideon hears it and he hear we hear
[1:20:09] Larry and he turns around and my dad
[1:20:12] goes, "Gideon."
[1:20:14] And right down in the trail we met him
[1:20:16] again. What identified that?
[1:20:20] A song that he had heard.
[1:20:24] Maybe the song your life is singing
[1:20:26] would catch somebody's attention. Maybe
[1:20:29] the words your life is living would
[1:20:32] catch somebody's attention. I never
[1:20:34] forgot that he turns and he heard I
[1:20:37] recognized the song.
[1:20:40] The life we live, what comes out of our
[1:20:42] cup
[1:20:44] can be lifegiving.
[1:20:49] You know such as I have
[1:20:54] I give unto you. Peter said in the name
[1:20:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ rise up and
[1:21:00] walk. Who did he have? Had Christ in him
[1:21:04] manner of the in the Holy Spirit. The
[1:21:07] woman with a blood issue, she drew
[1:21:10] something from God.
[1:21:12] She drew her healing right out of him
[1:21:15] because that's what was in his cup.
[1:21:19] The woman at the well, she drew from
[1:21:21] God. What did she draw? Salvation.
[1:21:25] Because the savior was there.
[1:21:30] What is drawn from me and you?
[1:21:36] Can somebody re get draw eternal life
[1:21:39] from you? Can somebody draw uh
[1:21:41] encouragement from you or will they draw
[1:21:44] a reaction and says, "Oo, I don't want
[1:21:46] to be around them anymore."
[1:21:49] Was a young man that attended the church
[1:21:51] many years ago here. I got him a job
[1:21:54] when I was working in the shop.
[1:21:57] Um and uh I introduced him. They got him
[1:22:01] the job and all and he was on fire for
[1:22:04] God. He was so on fire that he didn't
[1:22:06] work. He testified through the whole
[1:22:08] day.
[1:22:10] And I'm glad that's what they hired him
[1:22:11] for, or so he thought. But then his
[1:22:15] co-workers becoming started coming to me
[1:22:17] and say, "You know, the guy that you
[1:22:19] hired, he's not working. He's telling
[1:22:21] everybody else about the gospel."
[1:22:25] So the testimony wasn't working
[1:22:30] because he was hired to work.
[1:22:33] So I called him aside and I said, 'You
[1:22:35] know,
[1:22:36] they don't pay you to testify here. They
[1:22:39] pay you to do your job.
[1:22:41] And if you will do your job, that'll
[1:22:43] speak louder than anything else because
[1:22:45] they are complaining that you're not
[1:22:47] working.
[1:22:50] Now, he wasn't too happy about it, but
[1:22:52] he started working.
[1:22:54] But eventually, I didn't know we didn't
[1:22:56] see him too much. We we stopped seeing
[1:22:58] him here in church and his family and
[1:23:01] all. And one of the young men says, "You
[1:23:03] know, your all a sudden he was my
[1:23:08] really wasn't mine when he was being a
[1:23:10] Christian. You know, your brother you
[1:23:13] brought, he's drinking more than we are
[1:23:15] now."
[1:23:19] I had to go talk to him. I said, "Now
[1:23:20] your testimony has gone back the other
[1:23:22] way.
[1:23:25] Your cup is giving something totally
[1:23:27] opposite.
[1:23:33] What is drawing in for me and you? Eden
[1:23:35] was not just a place where you live,
[1:23:39] where you work, where you fellowship,
[1:23:41] but it was an atmosphere,
[1:23:45] an environment to where growth can be
[1:23:48] achieved
[1:23:49] like rivers,
[1:23:51] um, uh, lakes, like rivers and lakes for
[1:23:54] fish, soil for trees and plants, the
[1:23:57] environment for something to live.
[1:24:01] Brother Brandham said you could offend
[1:24:03] the Holy Spirit and it'll fly off to the
[1:24:05] side there until your attitude gets
[1:24:07] right and then he'll come back. He never
[1:24:09] said he'd leave you. He said it just
[1:24:11] flies off to the side there until you're
[1:24:13] habitable again.
[1:24:16] So what is that atmosphere?
[1:24:19] And in um
[1:24:22] again it says when a star leaves the
[1:24:24] atmosphere it was created for it
[1:24:27] destroys itself.
[1:24:30] He says, "What atmosphere do we keep
[1:24:33] around us?"
[1:24:38] Um, I remember doing it. I I don't do it
[1:24:41] anymore because I'm retired now,
[1:24:44] but I would decide that I was too tired
[1:24:47] to get up to go to work on Monday,
[1:24:50] Sunday evening.
[1:24:53] And sure enough, by Saturday, this early
[1:24:55] Monday morning, I was too tired to go to
[1:24:57] work.
[1:25:01] Don't try it. I'm not recommending it. I
[1:25:04] got pulled aside one day and they said,
[1:25:06] "Uh, we notice you're missing a lot of
[1:25:07] Mondays."
[1:25:09] And it was because we wouldn't go home
[1:25:11] after church. We'd go fellowship and I
[1:25:13] get to bed at 3 in the morning
[1:25:14] sometimes.
[1:25:16] When we were young, we did a lot of
[1:25:18] those things. Not no more. And you know
[1:25:21] what? I had to change.
[1:25:25] It wasn't their fault. was how I was
[1:25:28] what my cup was giving out.
[1:25:34] So
[1:25:36] what is the atmosphere that we keep
[1:25:39] around us? Or what house will you build
[1:25:42] me? A beautiful home, a temple,
[1:25:45] something physical or somewhere he can
[1:25:49] dwell.
[1:25:52] He He wants you.
[1:25:55] Yours is his dwelling place.
[1:25:59] The scripture teaches it that he comes
[1:26:01] and he cleans out.
[1:26:06] And the example he cleans out, he makes
[1:26:08] the place habitable something.
[1:26:11] But he doesn't say he automatically
[1:26:13] comes in. You've got to invite him in.
[1:26:16] You got to make him welcome in your
[1:26:17] home.
[1:26:20] But it's clean. and that one he cleaned
[1:26:22] you from, he comes back around and he
[1:26:24] says, "Hey, it's empty. Nobody's in
[1:26:26] there. I'm coming back in, but I'm going
[1:26:28] to bring some of my friends."
[1:26:30] And you know what happens when the party
[1:26:32] gets a lot of friends?
[1:26:34] It becomes a disaster.
[1:26:36] They called us one day out on a job site
[1:26:40] on a home that hadn't been turned over
[1:26:42] to the the owner and the young kids of
[1:26:46] the neighborhood decided to party in
[1:26:48] there that night. And you know, young
[1:26:50] kids that are doing drugs and drinking,
[1:26:52] all that, they're so well behaved. They
[1:26:54] trashed the house.
[1:26:58] They trashed the house.
[1:27:02] Now, if we would have been able to find
[1:27:04] all those young people and taken them
[1:27:05] back in and made them clean it, if we
[1:27:07] didn't change what was in their heart,
[1:27:09] they'd go do it again.
[1:27:12] Search me, oh God, and know my heart
[1:27:14] today. Make sure it's clean.
[1:27:19] Okay. What's what's in your cup?
[1:27:27] The o their only time if if his dwelling
[1:27:30] place is a church, a temple, special
[1:27:33] meetings,
[1:27:35] then our only time with him is when we
[1:27:37] are in those places.
[1:27:40] If all he does is dwell here at Tucson
[1:27:42] Tabernacle and he doesn't go from here.
[1:27:44] This the only time you come meet him,
[1:27:46] then the only time you're going to find
[1:27:47] him is when you come here.
[1:27:49] But he said, "I'll dwell in your heart
[1:27:51] if you'll let me in and he'll go with
[1:27:53] you."
[1:27:56] It's Christ in us, the hope of glory.
[1:28:01] Then his glory should be within us to be
[1:28:04] able to give to others. Such as I have,
[1:28:10] I give unto you.
[1:28:12] And don't worry about it. You're not
[1:28:14] going to give it all away.
[1:28:17] It's an eternal thing you have in you in
[1:28:20] Christ. You can't run it dry.
[1:28:24] He never said, "You'll don't use me all
[1:28:26] in one day because there won't be
[1:28:28] anything left for tomorrow." He's the
[1:28:29] unfailing God. He's eternal.
[1:28:34] And you know when you do something that
[1:28:36] is
[1:28:38] what's the right word? Offensive, wrong.
[1:28:41] And and sometimes it hurts us. Sometimes
[1:28:43] it things make it right.
[1:28:46] Make it right quickly.
[1:28:49] Sometimes all it is is a simple I'm
[1:28:52] sorry.
[1:28:54] I'm sorry.
[1:28:56] You know, uh and
[1:28:59] Some of us know by experience, and
[1:29:01] probably most of us by experience, when
[1:29:04] you fall behind on a payment of a loan
[1:29:06] or something, they add some interest to
[1:29:08] it.
[1:29:10] And you're not interested in it, but
[1:29:11] they are.
[1:29:14] And you know, it's a dime here and a
[1:29:16] dime there, but when it goes down to the
[1:29:17] road, that dime becomes $10, becomes a
[1:29:19] $100. And pretty soon, the interest is
[1:29:22] more than what you owe on the loan.
[1:29:26] I was working with some folks that that
[1:29:28] happened to when it was all said and
[1:29:30] done. They owed more than they borrowed,
[1:29:32] way more than they borrowed because they
[1:29:33] didn't stay alone. And you know, when it
[1:29:37] begins to build up, to build up, to
[1:29:39] build up,
[1:29:41] then what comes out can be hard to pull
[1:29:46] it all back together.
[1:29:48] That's why we have every day we examine
[1:29:50] ourselves and we look closely and we
[1:29:54] say, "Lord, what's my heart? What's my
[1:29:56] attitude? Can I turn my cheek?
[1:30:00] Can I bless somebody who's reviled
[1:30:03] against me?"
[1:30:05] And then we turn it around a little. Can
[1:30:07] I ask for forgiveness when I failed
[1:30:10] somebody?
[1:30:12] Can I humble my heart to say it was my
[1:30:14] fault? I'm sorry. If the musicians want
[1:30:16] to come on up here,
[1:30:20] I think I didn't use all the minutes.
[1:30:22] So, Brother Lyle, you can have an extra
[1:30:24] 20
[1:30:29] what's in my cup.
[1:30:31] Lord, show me
[1:30:34] that my cup. Uh, sometimes, like I said,
[1:30:37] we we dress the outer very well. We we
[1:30:40] make sure,
[1:30:41] you know, the hem length is right. this
[1:30:44] is a we wear the tie as you know we do
[1:30:46] this we do that but God looks past that
[1:30:48] and he looks down into the heart what's
[1:30:50] in the heart what's the motive of the
[1:30:53] heart
[1:30:55] you know and
[1:30:57] there's a there's a song we're not going
[1:30:59] to sing this one but create in me a
[1:31:01] clean heart oh God
[1:31:03] let my motive and clean out that one and
[1:31:07] and wash it out and make it willing and
[1:31:10] wanting to
[1:31:12] to be
[1:31:13] if to be able to help. They asked him,
[1:31:17] "When did you do when did we give you
[1:31:19] this cup of water?" I don't remember
[1:31:22] giving you a cup of water. He said,
[1:31:23] "When you did this to one of my little
[1:31:26] ones, you were doing it unto me."
[1:31:30] And when God blesses, God blesses.
[1:31:35] Shall
[1:31:37] fill my cup, Lord.
[1:31:41] Fill my cup.
[1:31:47] I lift it up.
[1:31:54] Come and quench
[1:31:58] this thirsting
[1:32:00] of my soul.
[1:32:06] Bread of heaven,
[1:32:11] feed me till I want.
[1:32:19] Here is my cup.
[1:32:22] Fill it up and make me first.
[1:32:32] I was a woman
[1:32:35] at the word.
[1:32:38] I was seeking
[1:32:45] for things
[1:32:48] that could not satisfy.
[1:32:57] And then
[1:32:59] I heard my savior
[1:33:03] speaking.
[1:33:07] Draw from my
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:13] shall
[1:33:15] try to stand now. And we just ask him
[1:33:18] before
[1:33:20] my God.
[1:33:25] I lift that up
[1:33:29] low.
[1:33:32] Come and quench
[1:33:35] with thirsty
[1:33:39] my soul.
[1:33:43] Bread of heaven,
[1:33:48] feed me till I want.
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:55] Here's my cup.
[1:33:58] Fill me up and make me.
[1:34:07] Lord, you see each one here. I believe
[1:34:11] each one of them wants to be sure
[1:34:14] those that are listening in or maybe
[1:34:15] some that would hear this later, they
[1:34:18] would examine, they would say, "Lord, I
[1:34:20] I want that cup to be clean."
[1:34:23] It's nice to have the outside clean,
[1:34:25] too, but it's more to start from the
[1:34:27] inside and let it work outward.
[1:34:30] Sometimes we get the outside looking so
[1:34:32] beautiful, we don't have time for the
[1:34:34] inside, but let it start from the inside
[1:34:37] and work out. So when someone has need
[1:34:39] of something,
[1:34:41] we can be like Peter said, "Such as I
[1:34:45] have, I give unto you in the name of the
[1:34:49] Lord Jesus Christ whatever it is that's
[1:34:51] needed, Lord.
[1:34:54] Father, that that one Lord that would
[1:34:56] that would come by and say, I'm in the
[1:34:58] need of peace. I'm in the need of rest.
[1:35:02] I'm in the need of joy."
[1:35:05] Or maybe it's I'm in need of just some
[1:35:07] kind of help. Maybe a strong arm to help
[1:35:10] me with this. Maybe just to draw close
[1:35:12] and and sometimes just a hug is enough
[1:35:15] to encourage someone. Lord, maybe it's
[1:35:18] $5.
[1:35:20] Maybe it's a ride home. Whatever it is
[1:35:22] that can be given, Lord,
[1:35:25] when you we get there and you say, you
[1:35:27] know, you did this to me. And we say
[1:35:29] when when you did it unto these, one of
[1:35:32] my my own, you were doing it unto me,
[1:35:35] Lord. Lord, may we be pleasing before
[1:35:38] you, Lord.
[1:35:40] And when we do it wrong, maybe we quick
[1:35:42] to make it right and not let it go on
[1:35:45] and go on and go on, but quickly say,
[1:35:48] "Forgive me, Lord, and help me to make
[1:35:51] it right in Jesus Christ's name." Amen.
[1:35:54] God bless you.
[1:35:58] Oh, fill my cup,
[1:36:02] Lord. Let's stand this evening. I lift
[1:36:06] it up,
[1:36:08] Lord.
[1:36:11] Come and quench
[1:36:16] this thirsting
[1:36:18] of my soul.
[1:36:24] Bread of heaven,
[1:36:28] feed me till I walk
[1:36:33] no more.
[1:36:36] Here's my cup.
[1:36:40] Fill it up and make me whole. There are
[1:36:46] millions.
[1:36:49] There are millions
[1:36:52] in this world
[1:36:55] who are craving.
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:02] the pleasures
[1:37:05] earthly things of
[1:37:14] none
[1:37:16] can match the oneous treasure
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:24] that I find
[1:37:28] in Jesus Christ My Lord,
[1:37:35] oh fill my cup, Lord.
[1:37:41] I lift it up,
[1:37:45] Lord.
[1:37:48] Come and quench
[1:37:52] this thirsty
[1:37:54] of my soul.
[1:37:59] Bread of heaven,
[1:38:04] feed me till I walk
[1:38:08] no more.
[1:38:11] Here's my cup.
[1:38:14] Fill it up and make me whole.
[1:38:23] Oh my brother,
[1:38:26] give the things
[1:38:29] this world gave me.
[1:38:36] Leave hungers
[1:38:39] that won't pass away.
[1:38:47] My blessed
[1:38:50] Lord will come and save you
[1:38:57] if you kneel
[1:39:01] to him and humbly pray.
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:09] Oh fill my cup Lord.
[1:39:14] I lift it up, Lord.
[1:39:20] Come and quench
[1:39:24] this thirsty
[1:39:26] of my soul.
[1:39:31] Bread of heaven,
[1:39:36] fade me till I want.
[1:39:43] Here's my cup.
[1:39:46] Fill it up and make room.
[1:39:55] Create in me a clean heart, oh God.
[1:39:58] Create in me a clean
[1:40:03] heart,
[1:40:06] oh
[1:40:08] God,
[1:40:12] and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:40:22] Oh, create in me a clean heart,
[1:40:29] oh Lord my God,
[1:40:34] and renew a right spirit
[1:40:38] within me.
[1:40:44] Oh, cast me not away
[1:40:49] from thy presence,
[1:40:54] oh Lord.
[1:40:56] Take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:41:06] Oh, restore
[1:41:09] unto me
[1:41:13] the joy of thy salvation,
[1:41:19] oh Lord, and renew a right spirit within
[1:41:25] me. Create,
[1:41:29] oh create in me a clean heart,
[1:41:37] oh Lord my God
[1:41:43] and renew a right spirit within me.

[1:42:00] oh God,
[1:42:05] and renew a rot spirit within me.
[1:42:14] Oh, cast me not away
[1:42:19] from thy presence,
[1:42:23] oh Lord,
[1:42:26] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:42:36] Glory restore
[1:42:39] unto me
[1:42:42] the joy of thy salvation
[1:42:49] and renew a right spirit
[1:42:53] within me.
[1:42:58] I have an anchor in my life holding to
[1:43:01] the solid rock.
[1:43:05] I have an anchor
[1:43:08] in my life.
[1:43:11] Holding to
[1:43:13] a solid rock, a blessed assurance
[1:43:18] that he gave me and I cannot
[1:43:24] be lost.

[1:45:00] Brother Dan Numer, would you just come
[1:45:01] and close the service in prayer? Believe
[1:45:03] they were leaving on a trip the end of
[1:45:05] this week. So, let's keep them also in
[1:45:07] prayer. They're to spend some time as a
[1:45:09] family. So, we appreciate our brothers
[1:45:12] or trustees and the ones that are
[1:45:13] helping do all the things around the
[1:45:14] church. So, let's just continue to keep
[1:45:16] them in prayer.
[1:45:21] Prayer request for brother Tom Weathers.
[1:45:23] He fell and broke his leg as well. Let's
[1:45:26] just keep him in prayer as well. Brother
[1:45:28] Daniel, it's all prayer. Heavenly
[1:45:32] Father, Lord, we're thankful, Lord, for
[1:45:34] this time that we've had today, Lord, to
[1:45:37] to spend looking into your word, Lord.
[1:45:38] And we pray, Lord, that we'd apply what
[1:45:41] we heard today, Father, and make us help
[1:45:43] us to leave better, Father. We ask for
[1:45:46] the different ones, Lord, that are
[1:45:48] hurting today, Lord. And this one that
[1:45:51] we just heard about, Father, the
[1:45:52] brother. Pray that you would be with
[1:45:55] him, Lord. Touch and heal him, Father.
[1:45:57] We know that that you have us in your
[1:45:59] hands, Lord, and just be near to him,
[1:46:02] Father. Strengthen him. And we pray that
[1:46:04] you'll be with the different ones, Lord,
[1:46:05] that aren't here. And the ones that need
[1:46:08] you, Lord, the ones that are traveling,
[1:46:09] Father.
[1:46:11] Just be with each one, Father, as we as
[1:46:13] we go from this place, Lord. We we ask
[1:46:15] that you keep your hands on each one,
[1:46:17] Lord. Touch us this week, Father. Keep
[1:46:20] us near to you, Lord, and draw us closer
[1:46:22] to your side. We ask and bless each one
[1:46:25] as we go. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:46:30] Amen. As you go this evening, let's just
[1:46:32] sing when the roll is called up yonder.
[1:46:33] I'll be there. Amen. Greet those around
[1:46:37] you when you leave.
[1:46:41] When the roll
[1:46:44] is called up yonder.
[1:46:47] When the roll
[1:46:50] is called up yonder.
[1:46:53] When the roll
[1:46:55] is called up yonder.
[1:47:00] When the roll is called up yonder. I'll
[1:47:03] be there.
[1:47:06] When the trumpet of the Lord shall
[1:47:09] sound, and time shall be no more, and
[1:47:12] the morning breaks, eternal bright and
[1:47:15] fair.
[1:47:17] When the saved of earth shall gather
[1:47:20] over on the other shore, and the ro is
[1:47:25] called up yonder, I'll be there.
[1:47:29] When the road
[1:47:32] is called up yonder.
[1:47:35] When the roll
[1:47:37] is called up yonder.
[1:47:41] When the roll
[1:47:43] is called up yonder.
[1:47:48] When the roll is called up yonder. I'll
[1:47:51] be there
[1:47:54] on that bright and cloudless morning.
[1:47:56] When the dead in Christ shall rise and
[1:48:00] the glory of his resurrection share.
[1:48:05] When his chosen ones shall gather to
[1:48:08] their home beyond the skies and the roll
[1:48:12] is called up yonder. I'll be there
[1:48:16] when the roll
[1:48:19] is called up yonder.
[1:48:22] When the roll
[1:48:25] is called up yonder.
[1:48:28] When the roll
[1:48:30] is called up yonder.
[1:48:35] When the roll is called up yonder, I'll
[1:48:38] be there.
[1:48:40] Let us labor for the master from the
[1:48:44] dawn till setting sun. Let us talk of
[1:48:47] all his wondrous love and care.
[1:48:52] When will all of life is over and our
[1:48:55] work on earth is done and the roll
[1:49:00] yonder I'll be there.
[1:49:03] When the roll
[1:49:06] is called up yonder.
[1:49:09] When the roll
[1:49:11] is called up yonder.
[1:49:15] When the roll
[1:49:17] is called up yonder.
[1:49:22] When the roll is called up yonder. I'll
[1:49:25] be there
[1:49:28] by and by.
[1:49:31] When morning comes, when all the saints
[1:49:36] of God are gather home, we will tell the
[1:49:41] story of how we've overcome, we will
[1:49:46] understand it better. By and by,
[1:49:50] oh by and by, when the morning comes,
[1:49:57] when all the saints of God are gather
[1:50:01] home, we will tell the story of how
[1:50:06] we've overcome. For we'll understand it
[1:50:09] better by and by.
[1:50:13] We are often tossed and driven on the
[1:50:16] restless sea of time. Somber skies and
[1:50:20] howling tempest off succeed up bright
[1:50:23] sunshine. In that land of perfect day
[1:50:27] when the mists have rolled away, we will
[1:50:31] understand it better by and by.
[1:50:35] Oh by and by.
[1:50:39] When the morning comes, when all the
[1:50:43] saints of God are gathered home, we will
[1:50:47] tell the story of how we've overcome.
[1:50:52] And we'll understand it better by and
[1:50:55] by.
[1:50:58] We are often destitute of the things
[1:51:01] that life demands. want of food and want
[1:51:05] of shelter thirsty hills and barren
[1:51:08] lands. We are trusting in the Lord and
[1:51:12] according to his word we will understand
[1:51:16] it better by and by.
[1:51:20] Oh, by and by. When the morning comes,
[1:51:26] when all the saints of God are gathered
[1:51:30] home, we will tell the story of how
[1:51:35] we've overcome. For we'll understand it
[1:51:39] better by and by.
[1:51:42] Trials mark on every hand and we cannot
[1:51:47] understand all the ways that God would
[1:51:50] lead us to that blessed promised land.
[1:51:54] But he'll guide us with his eye and
[1:51:57] we'll follow till we die. We will
[1:52:00] understand it better by and by.
[1:52:05] Oh, by and by. When the morning comes,
[1:52:11] when all the saints of God are gathered
[1:52:15] home, we will tell the story of how
[1:52:20] we've overcome. For we'll understand it
[1:52:24] better by and by.
[1:52:27] Temptations, hidden snares often take us
[1:52:31] unawares. And our hearts are made to
[1:52:35] bleed for some thoughtless word or deed.
[1:52:38] And we wonder why the test when we try
[1:52:42] to do our best, but we'll understand it
[1:52:46] better by and by.
[1:52:49] Oh, by and by.
[1:52:53] in the Lord.
[1:52:55] When all the saints of God are gathered
[1:53:00] home, we will tell the story how we've
[1:53:05] overcome. And we'll understand it
[1:53:08] better. By and by,
[1:53:12] oh by and by, when the morning comes,
[1:53:18] when all the saints of God are gathered
[1:53:22] home, we will tell the story how we've
[1:53:27] overcome. For we'll understand it better
[1:53:31] by and by.
[1:53:35] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[1:53:40] face. There to sing forever
[1:53:44] of his saving grace on the streets of
[1:53:48] glory. Let me lift my voice. Cares all
[1:53:53] past home at last ever to rejoice
[1:53:59] as I journey through the land. singing
[1:54:03] as I go. Torn souls to Calvary to the
[1:54:08] crimson flow.
[1:54:11] Many arrows pierce my soul from without.
[1:54:16] But my Lord leads me on through him I
[1:54:20] must win.
[1:54:22] Oh I want to see him. Look upon his face
[1:54:28] there. Sing forever
[1:54:30] of his saving grace
[1:54:33] on the streets of glory. Let me lift.
[1:54:39] There's all pass at last ever to rejoice
[1:54:45] when in service for my Lord. Dark may be
[1:54:48] the night,
[1:54:50] but I'll cling more close to him. He
[1:54:53] will give me life.
[1:54:56] Satan snares may vex my soul. Turn my
[1:54:59] thoughts aside.
[1:55:02] But my Lord goes ahead, leads where
[1:55:05] every time. Oh, I want to see him. Look
[1:55:10] upon his face.
[1:55:13] There to sing forever
[1:55:16] of his saving grace. On the streets of
[1:55:20] glory. Let me lift my voice. Cares all
[1:55:25] pass. Home at last, ever to rejoice
[1:55:30] when
[1:55:32] look toward the mountain high.
[1:55:35] And behold my savior there leading in
[1:55:39] the fight with a tender hand
[1:55:42] outstretched toward the valley low.
[1:55:46] guiding me. I can see as I onward go.
[1:55:52] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[1:55:56] face. There sing forever
[1:56:00] of his saving grace
[1:56:03] on the streets of glory that he lift up.
[1:56:08] Cares all pass home at last ever to
[1:56:12] rejoice
[1:56:14] when before me billows rise from the
[1:56:17] mighty deep.
[1:56:20] Then my Lord directs my bark. He does
[1:56:23] safely keep
[1:56:25] and he leads me gently on through this
[1:56:28] world below.
[1:56:31] He's a real friend to me. Oh, I love him
[1:56:35] so.
[1:56:36] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[1:56:40] face. There to sing forever
[1:56:44] of his saving grace
[1:56:47] on the streets of glory. Let me lift my
[1:56:51] voice. Cares all pass home at last. Ever
[1:56:56] to rejoice.
[1:56:58] Oh,
[1:57:18] heat, heat.
[1:57:35] Heat. Heat.
[1:57:44] Heat. Heat.
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:19] Heat.
[1:58:27] Heat.
[1:58:54] Heat. Heat.
[1:58:58] Heat.
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:14] Heat.
[1:59:21] Heat. Heat.
[1:59:42] Oh,
[1:59:49] [Music]
[2:00:00] heat.
[2:00:06] Heat. Heat.
[2:00:40] Heat. Heat.
[2:00:44] [Music]
[2:01:02] Heat. Heat.
[2:01:18] [Music]
