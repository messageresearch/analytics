[0:04] satisfy that
[0:07] longing in your
[0:10] soul. You may search this whole world
[0:17] or you'll be just as before.
[0:23] You'll never

[1:43] fortune and all the wealth you could
[1:48] obtain yet if you have not Christ
[1:55] within your living here would be in
[2:00] vain.
[2:01] There'll come a
[2:04] time when death shall call
[2:07] you. Your riches
[2:10] cannot help you then. For only
[2:17] Jesus can
[2:20] satisfy your soul.

[8:31] light of his
[8:34] glory and
[8:38] grace. Let's stand. We have a few prayer
[8:40] requests. Brother Jordan, could you take
[8:42] these prayer requests to the Lord for
[8:44] us? Um, we have, uh, Sister
[8:48] Amelia went to ER with stomach pain, so
[8:51] let's keep her in prayer for that. Um,
[8:53] and brother Dan mentioned there's a
[8:55] major storm about to hit
[8:58] Jeffersonville and they could get up to
[9:01] 12 ines in the next couple of days. So,
[9:04] and he said he's they've got a lot of
[9:05] family there. And, uh, we've also got
[9:07] some friends in Arkansas that they're
[9:09] cancelling service tonight. So, I don't
[9:11] know if it's the same storm, but let's
[9:13] keep all those people in prayer that are
[9:15] in the path of that
[9:16] storm. And then,
[9:19] um, Brother David
[9:22] Manasi, God bless you, saints. I'm
[9:24] requesting prayer requests for
[9:27] journey traveling mercies to Gree,
[9:31] Athens, Greece at the end of next month.
[9:34] My institution is sending us for an
[9:37] overseas assignment. Thank you, brother
[9:39] David.
[9:40] [Music]
[9:46] Let's pray this
[9:48] evening. Heavenly Father, we come to you
[9:52] and thank you for all that you've done
[9:54] for us, Lord. Your many blessings in our
[9:56] lives,
[9:58] Lord. You've brought us to service here
[10:00] tonight, Lord, with a desire to serve
[10:03] you and to worship you, Lord, and to
[10:05] just draw closer to you, Lord. And so we
[10:08] humbly ask if you would honor our
[10:11] desire, Lord, and just draw closer to
[10:14] us, Lord. Lord, forgive us of our sins
[10:16] and our iniquities, Lord. The things
[10:19] where we've fallen short, Lord, and our
[10:21] weaknesses, Lord, just strengthen us,
[10:24] Lord. Lord, where the feeble hands hang
[10:26] low, Lord, would you just raise them up,
[10:29] Lord? Where the ones that are sick and
[10:31] hurting, Lord, will you just heal them,
[10:33] Lord? Lord, there's many needs that have
[10:36] been mentioned over the last few weeks,
[10:39] Lord, that we know of, Lord, that are
[10:41] still there, Lord, and the ones
[10:43] mentioned tonight. Be with Brother David
[10:45] and traveling mercies, Lord, as he goes,
[10:47] Lord. And may he be a witness and a
[10:49] light, Lord, wherever he goes,
[10:51] Lord. Lord, be with those that are
[10:54] dealing with the storm and Lord, the
[10:57] weather and whatever situations are
[10:59] around, Lord. Just protect each one,
[11:02] Lord. May your perfect will be done in
[11:04] each life. Lord, be with sister Tony,
[11:07] Lord. Continue to touch her, Lord. And
[11:09] continue to give healing to brother
[11:11] Kevin as he recovers, Lord. And all the
[11:14] different needs, Lord, that have been
[11:16] spoken and the unspoken needs, Lord.
[11:18] Each one, Lord, we ask for. We now ask
[11:22] that you would be in this service,
[11:24] Lord. Let us be good hearers, Lord, and
[11:28] to keep our thoughts out of the way,
[11:30] Lord. And may you just speak through
[11:32] brother Daniel what you would have for
[11:33] us to know and to hear.
[11:36] Lord, bless each one. Bless the
[11:38] musicians, the song leader, the ones
[11:41] that have come. Lord, Lord, bless
[11:43] brother Daniel, Lord, as he prepares. Be
[11:45] with us all. We ask these things in your
[11:48] mighty lovely name, our Lord Jesus
[11:50] Christ.
[11:55] Amen. Let's sing that again. Sister Hope
[11:58] has a song special. We're gonna sing
[11:59] that chorus one more time.
[12:02] Turn your
[12:04] eyes upon
[12:08] [Music]
[12:10] Jesus. Look
[12:12] for in his
[12:15] wonderful
[12:17] [Music]
[12:19] face. And the
[12:22] things of
[12:25] earth will grow
[12:28] strangely
[12:30] dim in the
[12:32] light of his
[12:35] glory and grace.
[13:01] Sing it with me if you
[13:03] will. When we walk with the
[13:08] Lord in the light of his
[13:12] word, what a
[13:15] glory he sheds on our way.
[13:22] While we do his good
[13:26] will, he abides with us

[14:05] shadow can
[14:07] rise not a cloud in the sky
[14:12] eyes, but his smile
[14:15] quickly drives it away.
[14:22] Not a doubt or a

[15:03] burden we

[15:07] sorrow we
[15:10] share, but our toil he does
[15:15] quickly repay.
[15:20] Not a grief nor a

[16:07] Till all on the altar we

[19:20] I have all for him
[19:22] [Music]
[19:25] forsaken from my heart and now he keeps
[19:28] me by his
[19:31] power. Though all the world forsake me
[19:36] and Satan tempt me so through Jesus I
[19:40] shall safely reach the goal.
[19:45] Oh, he's a lily on the valley, the
[19:49] bright and morning star. He's the
[19:52] fairest of 10,000 to my

[25:54] And then um brother Michael mentioned
[25:57] that this is a pretty serious storm
[25:58] that's hitting the Midwest right now.
[26:00] Tornadoes and um
[26:03] they're expecting some pretty rough
[26:05] weather. Sister Hope mentioned it to me
[26:07] earlier and my brother I talked to my
[26:08] brother Adam on the phone a couple hours
[26:11] ago and yeah, this is these are big
[26:13] storms. 12 inches. We don't get that in
[26:16] three years here and they're expecting
[26:19] it in a day. So yeah, there could have
[26:22] some flooding. Uh, just just remember
[26:25] our friends and family that are in the
[26:28] Midwest in Indiana, Arkansas, in that
[26:32] area. Zeke and
[26:35] Zach, two guys that look alike there.
[26:37] They're related. It's Zach is Zeke's
[26:41] brother. Zach's been Zeke's been so
[26:45] journeying with us for the past few
[26:47] months. We're so thankful for him. He's
[26:50] he's a good kid. loves the Lord and uh
[26:54] we're gonna miss you, brother, and uh
[26:57] want you to come back
[26:58] soon. God God bless you. Give Give him a
[27:07] hand. Brother Daniel, Sister Ruby, bless
[27:09] you.
[27:11] Welcome. I think I see any more visitors
[27:14] um tonight. So, brother Lyall has been
[27:18] ministering on the life of King
[27:22] David. There's a character that's one of
[27:25] the main points and one of the main
[27:27] factors in in David's kingdom. And that
[27:31] is this King
[27:33] Saul. And I thought it would be good for
[27:36] us to learn a lot a little bit about
[27:38] this man Saul. And I think that would
[27:41] complement brother Lyall and his uh
[27:44] lessons on David. I I think it would be
[27:46] really good for us to know who this man
[27:49] is and where he came from and come of
[27:52] some of the highlights in his life. He
[27:56] um he's a perfect
[27:58] example of how a power
[28:02] corrupts. You take a very good man, a
[28:05] very good woman and give power and it
[28:08] can ruin somebody.
[28:10] to lay a
[28:11] foundation. Um, let's just give a little
[28:13] history of the world here. So, Adam and
[28:16] Eve, about 2,000 years since Adam and
[28:19] Eve sinned and were kicked out of the
[28:21] Garden of Eden, came this man named
[28:23] Abraham. And God promised Abraham that
[28:26] he would be that he would give him many,
[28:30] many, many offspring. And he said that
[28:32] he was going to give him this promised
[28:35] land beyond the Jordan River. And
[28:38] Abraham had a son named Isaac. Isaac had
[28:40] a son named Jacob. And Jacob had 12
[28:42] sons. And of those 12 sons, those are
[28:45] the children. Jacob's name was changed
[28:47] to Israel. And so when we hear the
[28:50] children of Israel, we're talking about
[28:51] the children of Jacob. And Jacob had a
[28:54] son named Joseph.
[28:57] Joseph as brother Lyall talked the past
[29:01] few months on this life of Joseph.
[29:04] Joseph was exiled into Egypt and
[29:09] eventually Joseph brought his
[29:11] family, his 11 brothers and his father
[29:16] Jacob into
[29:18] Egypt where they stayed there for about
[29:22] 400 years. And there rose up a pharaoh
[29:26] that didn't know Joseph. And he started
[29:29] being really hard on these what are
[29:31] called
[29:32] Hebrews. And God sent a deliverer named
[29:35] Moses to bring them out of this land
[29:38] Egypt, land of Egypt and towards this
[29:41] promised land that God had promised
[29:45] their fathers
[29:46] Abraham. So Moses gets them right up to
[29:51] the point. They're in the wilderness for
[29:52] 40 years. Moses gets them right to the
[29:56] crossing over and then Moses dies and
[29:59] this man named Joshua, Moses's general,
[30:04] he brings them over into this land that
[30:07] was promised to them. They fought the
[30:10] inhabitants of the land. We call him
[30:13] Canaanites. And Mo or Joshua, of course,
[30:17] he eventually dies. And it leads into
[30:20] the time of the judges. If you remember
[30:22] our Bible studies way back last year
[30:25] where we went through each book of the
[30:27] Bible. And this is the time of the
[30:31] judges. The
[30:33] judges basically they were these great
[30:36] men that God would raise up. The
[30:38] children of Israel would sin. They would
[30:41] get into trouble. God would raise up a
[30:43] leader called a judge and deliver them.
[30:47] the people would repent. And this cycle
[30:49] keeps repeating over and over until we
[30:51] get to the last judge who was this man
[30:54] named Samuel, a prophet of God. Very,
[30:59] very powerful
[31:01] man. Samuel was, as I said, he not only
[31:05] was he a judge, but he was a real man of
[31:12] God. and he led Israel for for many
[31:17] years. And and Samuel starts to get
[31:21] old. And Samuel's sons, which would have
[31:25] should have taken his place, were
[31:26] sinners. They weren't good men. And the
[31:29] people were watching this. Samuel had
[31:34] led the people of Israel into battle and
[31:37] won. One specific battle
[31:40] was the Philistines who are the nemesis
[31:43] of Israel for for a long time. The
[31:46] Philistines attacked Israel. Israel was
[31:49] not on a united front. The Philistines
[31:52] just roll through and conquer Israel.
[31:54] So, Israel gathers themselves together.
[31:57] They say, "We just got beat by these
[31:59] Philistines. Let's go down and get the
[32:01] ark of the covenant." Because when that
[32:04] ark goes forward, goes in front of us,
[32:06] we never lose. remember Joshua. So they
[32:10] went down and they got this ark and they
[32:12] went forth into battle and they lost
[32:15] again and the Philistines ends up end up
[32:18] taking the
[32:19] ark. It was a bad deal for the
[32:22] Philistines because the ark was just
[32:24] turned out to be a curse to them. And
[32:26] they end up giving this ark
[32:29] back to
[32:31] Israel. And then there is another battle
[32:34] and Samuel leads the Israelites into
[32:39] battle and
[32:41] wins. But Samuel's getting old and he
[32:44] doesn't have a successor. And remember
[32:47] the cycle of life which is
[32:52] sin,
[32:53] fail, deliverer,
[32:56] repent. Well, the people in Samuel's
[33:00] time, they really didn't want to live
[33:03] that godly life that they should have
[33:04] lived. And they look at Samuel, they
[33:07] say, 'Well, this man's our
[33:09] champion. And if he dies, we see his
[33:12] sons who are are just creeps. So, we
[33:16] can't count on them. They're dishonest.
[33:18] So, what are we going to do? And they
[33:20] see the world. And they see how these
[33:21] Philistines had attacked them and how
[33:24] organized they were. And they had these
[33:27] armies. And the the king of the
[33:28] Philistines would gather the armies
[33:30] together and they would all work in
[33:34] unity. and attack Israel and they'd win
[33:37] every time because Israel couldn't
[33:39] defend themselves because they were not
[33:43] united. So the people of Israel, they
[33:46] tell Samuel, "Hey, we want a king. We
[33:49] want someone who can lead us into
[33:51] battle because they see all of the world
[33:54] there." And that's how everybody else
[33:56] did it. So they say, "Why can't we do
[33:59] it?" But they ignored the fact that God
[34:01] always fought their battles for them.
[34:05] if they were living their lives
[34:07] sincerely to
[34:09] God. They didn't really want to do that.
[34:12] They wanted someone to lead them in the
[34:15] battle. They wanted someone to be their
[34:19] king. So eventually this man Saul is
[34:25] chosen and he came
[34:27] from an affluent family.
[34:31] he
[34:33] um would make would just make a perfect
[34:36] king. And if you look at the
[34:40] nature between this man Saul and who
[34:44] brother Lyall is talking about this man
[34:47] David, you see a very very different
[34:50] nature between the two. Saul was as I
[34:54] said was born into an affluent family.
[34:55] His dad was well respected. He was the
[34:59] bestlooking guy of his family. And not
[35:01] only that, but he was the best looking
[35:02] guy in the entire country. He was taller
[35:05] and built better than anyone else. And
[35:08] he was articulate. He had everything
[35:10] going for him. This man named
[35:11] Saul. But to be really to be a true
[35:17] success, you have to go through trials.
[35:21] You have to suffer. You have to work
[35:24] hard. You have to know what it is to to
[35:27] have money and food on the table. And
[35:29] then you also know you have to know how
[35:31] it is not to have food on the table. And
[35:34] you have to know how it is really to
[35:37] struggle. And we look at
[35:41] successes in people that that we see as
[35:44] success. Most of these people had to go
[35:47] through hard
[35:48] times. And this man Saul really didn't
[35:51] have to go through any hard times. So he
[35:54] was about a he was at a bit of a
[35:57] disadvantage in becoming king when you
[35:59] compare him to this man David who
[36:01] suffered greatly before he ever became
[36:04] king. And I look at some of these today
[36:09] some of like the the YouTube stars and
[36:11] the the Tik Tok stars and and it used to
[36:14] be when we were younger, brother
[36:17] Michael, it was the movie stars and the
[36:18] athletes and all that. now this this
[36:20] thing called YouTube and all that and
[36:22] and they're the the rich and and famous
[36:26] and people this generation as our
[36:29] generation was too they don't want to
[36:34] work to be successful. They want it to
[36:37] be handed to them. And it always ends it
[36:41] almost always ends in a bad way. First
[36:44] of all, someone that wants to succeed in
[36:48] life and wants to be a successful, wants
[36:50] to be rich, wants to be all of these
[36:52] things and is not willing to make to
[36:55] build a foundation and and to go through
[36:58] the hard work, that person is is not
[37:01] they're not going to be rich in the in
[37:03] the first place. But if they are, then
[37:05] they automatically will fail. I was
[37:08] reading in the um USA
[37:10] Today article, an article this morning
[37:14] about um people who won the
[37:17] lottery. Most people who win the
[37:22] lottery end up in debt. Sounds strange.
[37:26] Oh, not me. I wouldn't. Well, most do.
[37:29] Maybe you wouldn't, but you probably
[37:32] would because most people do. You think,
[37:35] well, if I had won a hund00 million, I
[37:37] would put away this and put in my Roth
[37:39] IRA here and this. Most
[37:42] people end up losing it all. And many
[37:47] have said that they wish that they had
[37:49] never won that
[37:52] mcurse to
[37:54] them. If
[37:56] Saul, we know the story now because we
[38:00] have our Bible, but if
[38:03] Saul would speak
[38:07] after, if he would come here today and
[38:10] speak to this church, he would probably
[38:12] say, "I wish I would have never become
[38:14] king. I lost my dignity. I lost my
[38:17] self-respect. I lost my family. They
[38:20] were killed in battle. I lost my
[38:23] character. I turned into a raving
[38:25] narcissist. I lost my religion. I did
[38:28] those things which were
[38:29] forbidden to do. I offered a sacrifice
[38:32] when only the priests were to sacrifice.
[38:35] I
[38:36] murdered. I even consulted a
[38:39] witch, a
[38:41] demonpossessed
[38:43] woman, because God had forsaken
[38:46] me. I was miserable my whole life. This
[38:50] is the greatest man in the whole world
[38:53] at the time. I was miserable my my whole
[38:55] life. I was full of hate. I was
[39:00] paranoid. I thought everyone was out to
[39:02] get me. I didn't trust anyone. Anytime
[39:05] someone would challenge me, I would
[39:06] destroy them. My own
[39:10] son, who was heir to my throne,
[39:13] preferred his friend over me to be king.
[39:18] So if Saul could say that, if Saul could
[39:23] speak today, that's probably what he
[39:25] would say. He'd probably say, "And most
[39:26] of all, God turned his back on my
[39:31] reign." That's Saul. He reigned for 40
[39:34] years. But God chose another king only
[39:37] after a couple years. Only after a
[39:39] couple years into his
[39:42] reign. He look he's right now. We look
[39:46] at him as a a mentally ill
[39:48] tyrant who is obsessed with killing his
[39:51] most loyal servant. His son's best
[39:54] friend, a man after God's own heart.
[39:56] This young man who was anointed king. As
[39:58] I said, only after a couple years of
[40:00] Saul's reign, this young man named
[40:02] David, who brother Lyall was talking
[40:04] about, he hated him. He is a perfect
[40:08] example of how power can corrupt a very,
[40:12] very good man.
[40:16] I want to pause for a minute as I was
[40:20] studying this over the past couple
[40:22] days. Brother Aaron and I were talking
[40:24] about um in the back here we were
[40:26] talking about some
[40:28] ministers who thank goodness that they
[40:32] didn't get the power but some did get
[40:36] power and they turn into very corrupt
[40:40] very immoral people. We see them on the
[40:44] news and you know the news is always
[40:46] quick to point out how bad these
[40:49] preachers of the so-called gospel are.
[40:52] And you see and it's because they rose
[40:54] to power. They they got a lot of
[40:57] popularity. They got arrogant and then
[40:59] they got filled with
[41:03] pride and pride was their
[41:07] downfall. I want to tell you just
[41:10] quickly. I know
[41:11] it's maybe off the subject of of
[41:15] Saul, but there's somebody that all of
[41:18] us know
[41:19] of that gets a whole lot of criticism,
[41:23] and that's brother William
[41:25] Brana. He was an
[41:29] intelligent, gifted
[41:31] man. He had he was gifted with spiritual
[41:35] discernment. And if if you have listened
[41:39] to the tapes, if you have listened to
[41:40] the ends of those sermons and those
[41:43] prayer lines, you see that cannot be
[41:45] faked. I heard one guy say, he says,
[41:47] "Oh, well, he used to read the phone
[41:48] book before he'd go to a city and have a
[41:52] meeting. You think we're idiots?
[41:55] Seriously, you think we're
[41:56] crazy?" And and just they would put him
[41:59] down and put him down. But this
[42:03] man, William
[42:05] Brandham, he came from the lowest of the
[42:08] low. He came from a sinner
[42:11] family and and very very a difficult f a
[42:16] difficult life. I interviewed a lady and
[42:20] and a man, a brother and sister. Their
[42:23] last name was Weber. If you listen to
[42:24] the tapes, Brother Jeremy, you're a tape
[42:26] listener. The lady when brother Brandham
[42:28] tried to take up the offering and she
[42:29] opened up her little coin purse, that
[42:32] was sister Weber. That was this their
[42:37] grandmother. And they both knew brother
[42:40] Brandham and they both grew up in the
[42:43] depression. And the lady, she wasn't a
[42:48] fan of
[42:50] uh the uh the message as we call it.
[42:54] And she told me, she said, "Those
[42:56] Brandhams," she says, "we were all
[42:58] poor." Because we grew up in in the
[43:00] depression. She said, "But those
[43:01] Brandoms, they were the poorest of the
[43:04] poor. They didn't have anything." He,
[43:07] she said, they didn't have
[43:09] shoes. They would come to school. She
[43:11] was in the same grade, I think, as as
[43:12] Brother Brandham's
[43:15] um may have been her one of his brothers
[43:17] or his sister, but she said none of the
[43:20] Brandhams ever had shoes. They didn't
[43:21] have clothes. We know the story from
[43:23] from his life story. He didn't have a
[43:25] shirt and he had to wear a jacket in in
[43:28] uh in the um in the school
[43:31] room. He was he came through it. He
[43:34] suffered and that suffering built his
[43:38] character and he surrounded himself not
[43:42] like this man Saul who when he came to
[43:46] power it ruined
[43:48] him. The greater this man William
[43:51] Brandom got the more humble he became.
[43:54] the sweeter he
[43:55] became. His friends with people like my
[43:58] grandfather, his closest friends,
[44:01] Bankswood and Welch
[44:02] Evans, they were
[44:05] nobodyies. My grandfather was a was he
[44:08] owned a mechanic shop. Bankswood was
[44:11] just a a carpenter. Neither of them were
[44:15] educated. Neither of them were really
[44:17] anything in society. Neither of them had
[44:19] money. Yet, this is who he wanted to
[44:21] spend his time with. You know, they I'm
[44:23] sure they paid ti, but it wasn't much.
[44:26] Yet, this is who Brother Brandham
[44:28] surrounded himself with. They were out
[44:30] to eat one time, my my grandpa, Brother
[44:32] Woods, and Brother Brandham, and they
[44:35] sat down at the
[44:36] table. And they ordered off the
[44:41] menu. And Brother Woods, he uh he looked
[44:45] over at another table and he said,
[44:47] "What's what's that guy over there
[44:49] having?" Um what is that? And they said,
[44:51] "Well, that's the whatever." And he
[44:53] says, "I'll have
[44:55] that." And then Brother Woods got up and
[44:59] went to the
[45:01] restroom. And Brother Ram tells my
[45:03] grandpa, he says, "Do you see how
[45:05] Brother Woods ordered?" He said, "He
[45:07] can't
[45:08] read. This is his best friend."
[45:12] And you see how this the
[45:15] greater really that brother Brandham
[45:18] got, the more you saw this good
[45:20] character come out. And in contrast, the
[45:23] worse this man Saul became. I was I used
[45:27] to do an article. I wrote an article for
[45:29] um our magazine when I was in
[45:31] Jeffersonville and I used to ride my
[45:34] bike around Jeffersonville and talk to
[45:37] old people sitting on on their porches
[45:39] and it was a lot of them. They that's
[45:42] what they do back there. And I would
[45:44] walk up and say, "I'm doing a research
[45:46] project on this man named William
[45:47] Brandom." And and they would uh most of
[45:51] them, it's funny that a lot of them, I'd
[45:54] say most of the ones that I talked to
[45:56] were born there and raised raised there.
[45:59] And almost all of them knew Brother
[46:01] Brandon
[46:02] personally. Never
[46:05] once, not one time. And there was
[46:09] between 50 and a hundred of them. might
[46:11] say, "Did I ever hear a negative
[46:13] word?" It was all positive. Not one.
[46:18] Now, pretty much all of them had plenty
[46:22] negative words to say about message
[46:25] believers. I mean it. There was a lot of
[46:28] negative about that, but never about
[46:32] that man. And you see that character, it
[46:36] just it it came out. And it's hard it's
[46:39] hard not to love him. It was hard hard
[46:41] to criticize him. They all everyone that
[46:44] talked to him thought he was their best
[46:45] friend. Oh yeah, he used to come by. He
[46:47] dropped off dropped off uh this meat or
[46:50] that meat and he'd go hunting and and
[46:53] you know they had different ted the
[46:54] barber told me a testimony one time he
[46:56] had brother came back like five
[46:58] squirrels and he said every one of those
[46:59] was shot right through the eye and he
[47:01] told me the story about the squirrels
[47:03] and and how good of a shot he was. They
[47:07] thought he was great. But then you see
[47:10] power in someone else if they don't have
[47:14] the character will destroy them. And
[47:17] that's what happened with this man named
[47:23] Saul. They end up
[47:26] hating anyone who disagrees with
[47:29] them. We see it in the pulpit many
[47:32] times.
[47:34] They attack people in their own
[47:37] congregations, the ones they're supposed
[47:39] to
[47:40] serve. And you see that spirit start to
[47:43] form in Saul. You'll see it as we start
[47:46] to get through our lesson. And and I I
[47:49] don't know how far I'll get today, but
[47:50] we'll continue it on. You'll see that
[47:52] that spirit of arrogance and pride start
[47:56] to raise up in this man,
[47:58] Saul, and the hatred. But he started
[48:02] very very
[48:04] good. So as I said earlier in my my
[48:08] short history, the Israelites had lost a
[48:11] battle with the
[48:13] Philistines and Samuel, they'd lost a
[48:16] couple battles and then Samuel leads
[48:18] them to victory. And they remembered how
[48:21] organized these Philistines were. And
[48:24] the Israelites, they were 12 separate
[48:26] tribes and they didn't even work
[48:28] together really. Sometimes they fought
[48:29] amongst themselves. They were not a
[48:32] united front. If they were united, they
[48:34] could form be a formidable um
[48:38] force. But they weren't. But what they
[48:42] what they didn't do, they didn't
[48:44] remember that every time they needed
[48:46] something, God would part the Red Sea
[48:48] for them. God would bring down the walls
[48:51] of Jericho for them. But they didn't
[48:54] remember that. What they wanted was they
[48:57] wanted to they wanted security and
[49:00] safety without trusting in
[49:03] God. And that's the foundation of how
[49:05] this man Saul came to be. Now Samuel was
[49:11] old. His boys were not moral. So the
[49:15] people asked a very good question, one
[49:17] that we would probably ask. They said,
[49:19] "What are we going to do when the
[49:21] prophet dies?"
[49:23] 1st Samuel chapter
[49:29] 8. Let's start with verse number
[49:32] five. And they said unto him, "Behold,
[49:35] thou are old, thy
[49:37] sons. Walk not in thy ways. Now make us
[49:41] a king to judge us like all the
[49:43] nations." But the thing displeased
[49:46] Samuel when they said, "Give us a king
[49:48] to judge us." And Samuel prayed unto the
[49:51] Lord. And Samuel said, and the Lord said
[49:53] unto Samuel, hearken unto the voice of
[49:55] the people, and all that they say unto
[49:58] thee, for they have not rejected thee,
[50:01] but they have rejected
[50:03] me, that I should not reign over them,
[50:07] according to all the works which they
[50:09] have done since the day that I brought
[50:12] them up out of Egypt, even unto this
[50:14] day, wherewith they have forsaken me,
[50:17] and have served other gods, so do they
[50:21] also. also unto
[50:23] thee. The
[50:25] way was for the Israelites, the right
[50:28] way was for the Israelites to stop
[50:30] sinning, to seek God, and then trust in
[50:35] God. Now therefore, hearken unto their
[50:38] voice. How be it, yet protest solemnly
[50:41] unto them, and show them the manner of
[50:44] the king that shall reign over them. So
[50:46] God's telling them to re God's telling
[50:48] Samuel to resist them, but go ahead with
[50:52] what they say and prophesy of what's
[50:55] coming. And Samuel told all the words of
[50:59] the Lord unto the people that asked of
[51:01] him a
[51:03] king. And he said, "This will be the
[51:05] manner of the king that shall reign over
[51:06] you. He will take your sons and appoint
[51:09] them for himself, for his chariots, and
[51:13] for his horsemen. And some shall run
[51:15] before his chariots. And he will appoint
[51:17] him captain over thousands, and captain
[51:20] over 50s, and will set them to ear set
[51:23] them to ear his ground, and to reap his
[51:26] harvest, and to make his instruments of
[51:29] war, and instruments of his chariots.
[51:31] And he will take your daughters to be
[51:33] confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to
[51:35] be bakers. And he will take your fields
[51:37] and your vineyards and your and your
[51:39] olive yards even to the best of them and
[51:42] give them to his servants. And he will
[51:44] take the tenth of your seed and of your
[51:47] vineyards and give it to his officers
[51:49] and to his servants. And he will take
[51:51] your man's servants and your maidervants
[51:53] and your goodliest young men and your
[51:55] asses and put them to his work. And he
[51:58] will take a tenth of your
[52:00] sheep. And you shall be his
[52:03] servants. And you shall cry out in that
[52:06] day because of your king which you have
[52:09] chosen which ye shall have chosen you
[52:13] and the Lord will not hear you in that
[52:16] day.
[52:18] Nevertheless, the people refused to obey
[52:20] the voice of Samuel, and they say,
[52:22] "Nay," they said, "Nay, but we will have
[52:25] a king over
[52:27] us, that we may also that we also may be
[52:31] like all the nations, and that our king
[52:33] may judge us and go out before us and
[52:36] fight our
[52:38] battles." And Samuel heard all the words
[52:41] of the people, and he rehearsed them in
[52:43] the ears of the Lord. And the Lord said
[52:46] to Samuel, "Hearken unto their voice,
[52:49] listen to them, and make them a king."
[52:52] And Samuel said unto the men of Israel,
[52:54] "Go ye every man unto a city." So go
[52:58] away. Now watch what God gives the
[53:02] people of Israel. They wanted a king
[53:04] that they could be proud of. They wanted
[53:06] a king that would be intimidating to
[53:08] their enemies. They wanted they they
[53:10] didn't want what they didn't want to do
[53:14] is they didn't want to trust God. They
[53:16] didn't want to stop their sinning, but
[53:18] they wanted someone to take the place of
[53:21] their personal walk with
[53:25] God. I'll say it
[53:27] again. They wanted a man to take the
[53:31] place of their personal walk with God.
[53:38] And then God gives them exactly what
[53:40] they desired. 1st Samuel chapter
[53:43] nine. And there was a man of Benjamin
[53:47] whose name was
[53:48] Kish, the son of Abel, the son of Zeror,
[53:52] the son of Beckarath, the son of Apha, a
[53:57] Benjamite, a mighty man of
[53:59] power. So we see that Kish was
[54:02] respected. He was probably rich. And it
[54:05] would make sense that the king would
[54:07] come from
[54:08] him. And he had a son whose name was
[54:11] Saul, a choice young man and goodly.
[54:15] Goodly means handsome in the King James
[54:17] version. And there was not among the
[54:20] children of Israel a goodlier person
[54:22] than he. So he was the handsomest of all
[54:24] of
[54:26] them. From his shoulders and upward, he
[54:29] was
[54:30] higher than any of the people. So, he
[54:34] was tall, dark, and
[54:37] handsome, and like a foot taller than
[54:39] everybody
[54:41] else. So, what happened is this
[54:44] good-looking guy, this good-looking
[54:45] young man, Saul, who was born to this
[54:47] fairly wealthy family, um, affluent
[54:49] family, his dad's donkeys got
[54:53] away. So, dad Kish says, "Saul, go find
[54:57] my donkeys. Take a servant and go find
[54:59] the donkeys." So Saul takes a servant
[55:02] and they're looking around and they go
[55:05] here and they go there and they go all
[55:07] over the country and they they can't
[55:08] find these
[55:10] donkeys and the food's run out and and
[55:13] Saul's like, "Man," he tells his
[55:16] servant, he
[55:17] says, "We better go back because dad's
[55:21] going to be more worried about us than
[55:24] he is going to be about these donkeys."
[55:27] So the servant says, he says, "Hey
[55:30] Saul," he says, "Um, you see that city
[55:32] down there?" He said, ' There's a man of
[55:35] God down there, a
[55:38] seer. He said, "Let's go ask him where
[55:42] your dad's donkeys
[55:44] are." And and Saul says,
[55:47] "Well, I don't have any any more food.
[55:51] We don't I don't have any money with me.
[55:53] Um, you know, we'd have to give him an
[55:55] offering. what what what should we do?
[55:57] And the servant says, "No, no." He says,
[55:59] "I got I got some money." He said,
[56:00] "Let's just go down there and then we'll
[56:02] give him this as an offering and then
[56:04] you'll see he'll tell us where the where
[56:06] the donkeys
[56:07] are and let's uh we're in right now.
[56:11] We're in
[56:12] um 1st Samuel 9. Let me
[56:16] read kind of a a neat addition. Uh 1st
[56:20] Samuel 9:9.
[56:23] This this will um kind of solidify some
[56:26] things. Before time in Israel, when a
[56:28] man went to inquire of God, this is just
[56:31] interjected in the text. Before time in
[56:34] Israel, when a man went to inquire of
[56:36] God, thus he spake, come and let us go
[56:39] to the
[56:41] seer, for he that is now called a
[56:44] prophet was before time called a seer.
[56:48] I love that part because the author of 1
[56:51] Samuel is saying, "Okay, they're going
[56:53] to be saying seers." He's they're very
[56:55] accurate in what they wrote down.
[56:57] They're going to be calling these these
[56:59] men seers, but now we call them
[57:01] prophets. So, basically, they're the
[57:03] same
[57:05] thing. Verse number 15, let's let's go
[57:08] there. Now the Lord had told Samuel in
[57:12] his
[57:13] ear a day before Saul came, saying,
[57:16] "Tomorrow, about this time, I will send
[57:18] thee a man out of the land of Benjamin,
[57:20] and thou shalt anoint him to be captain
[57:22] over my people, and he shall save my
[57:25] people out of the hand of the
[57:26] Philistines, for I have looked upon my
[57:28] people, because their cry is, come unto
[57:32] me."
[57:33] And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said
[57:37] unto him, "Behold the man whom I spake
[57:39] to thee of, this same shall reign over
[57:43] my people." What a
[57:45] moment. Right there, the prophet Samuel
[57:50] realizes that this is going to be the
[57:54] first king of Israel.
[57:57] And Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate
[58:00] and said, "Tell me where is the seer's h
[58:03] where where the sear's tell me where the
[58:06] seer's house is." And Samuel answered
[58:07] Saul and said, "I am the
[58:10] seer. Go up before me unto the high
[58:13] place, for ye shall eat with me today,
[58:16] and tomorrow I will I will let thee go
[58:19] and will tell thee all that is in thine
[58:22] heart." So he's showing the gift of a
[58:24] prophet right here. Samuel's saying that
[58:26] I will tell you what's in your heart.
[58:29] That discernment gift will come out in
[58:31] Sam Samuel and you don't even need need
[58:33] to speak it.
[58:35] Saul, it's a mark of a
[58:37] prophet. And this is prophecy. If a man
[58:40] can tell the secrets of the heart and
[58:42] not be wrong, not just be right most of
[58:45] the time, many of us can do that, but
[58:47] not be wrong, be right every time, then
[58:51] that is the mark of a prophet. And this
[58:54] Samuel is a true prophet of God. And as
[58:58] for thine
[59:00] asses that were lost three days ago,
[59:03] Samuel's like, "Wait a minute. I didn't
[59:04] tell you about the
[59:06] donkeys. But as for your
[59:08] donkeys that were lost three days
[59:11] ago, set not thy mind on them. Don't
[59:14] worry about them, for they are
[59:16] found." And on whom is all, now listen
[59:19] to this, and on whom is all the desire
[59:22] of Israel. Remember I was t saying
[59:24] before that Israel was saying we want a
[59:26] king. We want a king. And that was
[59:28] buzzing all over the country all over
[59:30] the 12 tribes. We want
[59:33] this and on whom is all the desire of
[59:37] Israel. Is it not on
[59:41] you and on thy father's house and on all
[59:44] thy father's house?
[59:47] And Saul answered and said, "Am I not a
[59:51] Benjamite, the smallest of the tribes of
[59:53] Israel, and my family, the least of all
[59:56] the families of the tribe of Benjamin?
[59:58] Wherefore then speakest thou to
[1:00:00] me?" Look at the humility in Saul, a
[1:00:04] humble
[1:00:05] man, definitely not the man that he
[1:00:07] would become.
[1:00:09] And Samuel took Saul and his servant,
[1:00:12] and brought them into the parlor, and
[1:00:14] made them to sit in the chiefest place
[1:00:15] among them that were bidden, which were
[1:00:18] about 30 persons. So about 30 important
[1:00:21] people were at this feast. And Samuel
[1:00:24] put Saul and his servant in the most
[1:00:27] important spots. So he set Saul like at
[1:00:29] the head of the
[1:00:30] table where the where the guy that's in
[1:00:33] charge
[1:00:35] sits. And Samuel said to the cook,
[1:00:38] "Bring the portion which I gave thee of
[1:00:40] which I said to thee, set it by thee."
[1:00:42] And the cook took up the shoulder and
[1:00:45] that which was upon it, and set it
[1:00:47] before Saul. And Samuel said,
[1:00:49] "Behold, that which is left, set it
[1:00:52] before thee, and eat. For unto this time
[1:00:55] hath it be been kept for thee since I
[1:00:57] said, and I have invited the people." So
[1:01:00] Saul did eat with Samuel that day. And
[1:01:03] when they were come down from the high
[1:01:04] place into the city, Samuel communed
[1:01:06] with Saul upon the top of the house, and
[1:01:09] they arose early. And it came to pass
[1:01:11] about the spring of the day that Samuel
[1:01:14] called Saul to the top of the house,
[1:01:15] saying, "Get up that I may send thee
[1:01:19] away. And Saul
[1:01:21] arose, and they went out, both of them,
[1:01:24] he and Samuel, abroad." And as they were
[1:01:26] going down to the end of the city,
[1:01:29] Samuel said to Saul, "Bid the servant to
[1:01:32] pass on before us." And he passed
[1:01:35] on. But stand thou still a while that I
[1:01:40] might show thee the word of God. So here
[1:01:43] is Samuel the prophet talking with this
[1:01:45] young man
[1:01:46] Saul. Let the servant go ahead because I
[1:01:49] want to talk to you
[1:01:52] privately. Chapter 10 verse one. Then
[1:01:55] Samuel took a vial of oil and poued on
[1:01:58] poured it on his head and kissed him and
[1:02:00] said, "Is it not because the Lord hath
[1:02:02] anointed thee to be captain over his
[1:02:06] inheritance?" Now Samuel prophesies a
[1:02:08] few things that are going to happen
[1:02:10] right after Saul leaves him. So Saul
[1:02:14] knows that this is coming from God. And
[1:02:18] imagine if something like that just
[1:02:21] happened to you or me, it would be in
[1:02:23] our minds. would be like, "No, that
[1:02:25] can't be true. That can't be true." But
[1:02:26] if the prophet tells us this is going to
[1:02:29] happen and this is going to happen and
[1:02:31] then this is going to happen, it would
[1:02:32] give you faith to say that this man,
[1:02:34] what he said is really true. And that's
[1:02:37] what happened with Saul. He left Samuel
[1:02:39] and the things that Samuel prophesied to
[1:02:41] come to pass just on his road
[1:02:45] happened. This is what happens to Saul.
[1:02:49] When thou art departed from me today,
[1:02:52] then thou shalt find two men by Rachel
[1:02:55] supplicer in the border of Benjamin at
[1:02:58] Zalsa, and they will say unto thee, the
[1:03:02] asses which thou wentest to seek are
[1:03:05] found. And lo, thy father hath left the
[1:03:08] care of the asses and and sorrowed for
[1:03:11] you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
[1:03:15] So Saul was right. Dad was worrying
[1:03:17] about him more than he was worrying
[1:03:19] about the
[1:03:20] donkeys. Then shalt thou go forward from
[1:03:23] hence, and thou shalt come to the plain
[1:03:25] of Taber, and there shall meet thee
[1:03:29] three men going up to Beth going up to
[1:03:32] God to Bethl. Look at the precision in
[1:03:36] the prophet. Three men going up to God
[1:03:39] to Bethl. One carrying three kids, not
[1:03:42] like kids, goats.
[1:03:47] Not like little kid, you know, human
[1:03:50] beings, goats, and car and another
[1:03:53] carrying three loaves of bread and
[1:03:55] another carrying a bottle of wine. And
[1:03:57] they will salute thee and give thee two
[1:04:00] loaves of bread which thou shalt receive
[1:04:02] of their hands. After that thou shalt
[1:04:06] come to the hill of God, where is the
[1:04:08] garrison of the Philistines, the
[1:04:10] Philistines were
[1:04:11] ruling. And it shall come to pass when
[1:04:14] thou art come to the to the city that
[1:04:16] thou shalt meet a company of prophets
[1:04:19] coming down from the high place with
[1:04:21] sultry and tab and tabet and pipe and
[1:04:25] harp before them and they shall
[1:04:28] prophesy. So these are gifted men. These
[1:04:31] are religious men. These are ministers.
[1:04:33] and the spirit of the Lord will come
[1:04:35] upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with
[1:04:39] them, and shalt be turned into another
[1:04:44] man. And let it be when these signs are
[1:04:46] come to thee, that thou do as occasion
[1:04:50] that thou do as occasion serve thee, for
[1:04:53] God is with thee. For thou and thou
[1:04:56] shalt go down before me to Gilgal, and
[1:04:59] behold, I will come down unto thee to
[1:05:02] offer a burnt offering, and to
[1:05:04] sacrifice, sacrifices a peace offering.
[1:05:07] Seven days shalt thou tar till I come to
[1:05:09] thee, and show thee what thou shalt do."
[1:05:13] And it was so that when he had turned
[1:05:16] his back to go from Samuel, God gave him
[1:05:20] another heart. And those signs came to
[1:05:24] pass that day. So the prophecies came to
[1:05:29] pass. And listen to this. And when they
[1:05:31] came hither to the hill, behold, the
[1:05:33] company of prophets met him, and the
[1:05:35] spirit of God came upon him, and he
[1:05:39] prophesied among them.
[1:05:41] We've heard that David and Saul were
[1:05:44] numbered among the prophets. It's this
[1:05:46] story right
[1:05:48] here. And when they came to the hill,
[1:05:52] behold, a company of prophets met him,
[1:05:55] and the spirit of God came upon him, and
[1:05:58] he saw prophesied among them. And it
[1:06:02] came to pass when all that knew him
[1:06:04] before time saw saw that, behold, he
[1:06:07] prophesied among the prophets. Then the
[1:06:09] people said one to another, what is this
[1:06:12] that is come unto the son of Kish? Is
[1:06:15] Saul also among the
[1:06:18] prophets? And one and one of the same
[1:06:20] place answered and said, but who is
[1:06:23] their father? Therefore, it came it
[1:06:26] became a proverb, Saul is among the
[1:06:30] prophets. Became a saying. People
[1:06:33] started saying this.
[1:06:36] And when he had made an end to
[1:06:38] prophesying, he came to the high place
[1:06:39] place. And Saul's uncle said unto him,
[1:06:42] now remember Samuel the prophet had just
[1:06:44] told him that you are going to be king
[1:06:46] of Israel, first
[1:06:49] one. And Saul's uncle said unto him and
[1:06:51] to his servant, where where have you
[1:06:53] been? And he and and he said to seek the
[1:06:56] asses. And when we saw that they were
[1:06:59] nowhere, we came to Samuel. So we were
[1:07:01] looking for the donkeys and we couldn't
[1:07:03] find them. So we went to the man of God.
[1:07:06] We went to the
[1:07:07] prophet. And Saul's uncle said, "Tell
[1:07:10] me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto
[1:07:13] you." And Saul said unto his
[1:07:15] uncle. He plainly he told us plainly
[1:07:19] that the asses were found, but the
[1:07:22] matter of the kingdom where of Samuel
[1:07:25] spoke, he told him not. Look at the
[1:07:28] humility of
[1:07:29] Saul. He didn't tell his uncle or
[1:07:31] servant or anyone that he was going to
[1:07:33] be the king of Israel. You would think
[1:07:35] that he would be telling everybody, but
[1:07:38] do you see the character in the young
[1:07:39] man Saul? He was a good character, a
[1:07:42] humble
[1:07:44] character. Now, back to the prophet
[1:07:47] Samuel after he had secretly anointed
[1:07:49] Saul, the king of Israel. Verse number
[1:07:52] 17. And Samuel called the people
[1:07:54] together unto unto the Lord at Mispa.
[1:07:56] And he said unto the children of Israel,
[1:07:57] thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel, I
[1:07:59] brought up Israel out of Egypt, and
[1:08:02] delivered you out of the hand of the
[1:08:03] Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
[1:08:05] the kingdoms, and all of them that
[1:08:06] oppress
[1:08:08] you. Remember the book of Joshua, book
[1:08:12] of Exodus. Don't you remember? I am the
[1:08:14] one that did all of this for you.
[1:08:19] And you have said, and you have this day
[1:08:21] rejected your God, who himself saved you
[1:08:24] out of all your adversities and all your
[1:08:27] tribulations, and you have g you have
[1:08:30] said unto him,
[1:08:31] "Nay, but set a king over us." Now
[1:08:35] therefore, present yourselves before the
[1:08:37] Lord by your tribes and by your
[1:08:38] thousands. So Samuel cast lots, which is
[1:08:41] like the Uram Thumbman back then. He
[1:08:43] wanted to show the people that God chose
[1:08:45] this king, not me. Skip to verse
[1:08:49] 24. And Samuel said to all the people,
[1:08:53] "See ye him whom the Lord hath chosen,
[1:08:58] and there's none like him among all the
[1:09:00] people." And all the people shouted and
[1:09:03] said, "God saved the king." So they're
[1:09:06] looking at this big goodlooking guy
[1:09:08] standing there, foot taller than anyone
[1:09:10] else. He was the best looking guy in
[1:09:12] Israel. He comes from a famous and
[1:09:14] wealthy family and and the guys are
[1:09:16] might looking at him being like, "Man,
[1:09:18] this guy is cool. He can probably bench
[1:09:19] 400
[1:09:21] pounds." The girls are looking at him
[1:09:23] and say, "He's
[1:09:25] cute. How many wives does he have?" I'm
[1:09:27] just kidding. And the warriors are
[1:09:31] looking at this man say, "I would follow
[1:09:32] that man into
[1:09:34] battle. That's a man I would follow. A
[1:09:37] man that looks like that."
[1:09:40] Then Samuel told the
[1:09:41] people the manner of the kingdom and
[1:09:44] wrote it in a book and laid it up before
[1:09:47] the Lord. And Samuel sent all of the
[1:09:49] people away, every man to his
[1:09:52] house. So the prophet in his old age, he
[1:09:56] lays out how the new kingdom of Israel
[1:09:58] would function in that book. And Saul
[1:10:01] also went home to Gibia, and there went
[1:10:03] with him a band of men whose hearts God
[1:10:06] had touched. But the children of Balile
[1:10:08] said, now this is
[1:10:10] important. But the children of Balile
[1:10:13] said, "How shall this man save us?" And
[1:10:16] they despised him and brought no
[1:10:19] presence. But he held his peace. But
[1:10:22] Saul held his
[1:10:24] peace. Look at the character of King
[1:10:27] Saul here. He had just been crowned
[1:10:31] king. He had just been anointed king.
[1:10:33] And yet he had patience with these
[1:10:35] people that that criticized. Children of
[1:10:38] bile means worthless people. And these
[1:10:41] are the ones who will complain no matter
[1:10:44] what you do. They will find fault in
[1:10:46] everything. They're always they're
[1:10:48] always finding fault. They're always
[1:10:50] criticizing. These kind of people are
[1:10:52] always present. They're they're present
[1:10:55] here. They're present in every church.
[1:10:58] They are always
[1:11:00] there. And no matter what you do, they
[1:11:03] are going to criticize it and they'll
[1:11:04] make fun of
[1:11:05] it. The Bible calls them the children of
[1:11:09] Bile. Other
[1:11:11] men when they became king later on they
[1:11:16] killed these people that would criticize
[1:11:20] them. Solomon's son Riaboam. Remember
[1:11:23] that
[1:11:24] story? David's son Solomon and Solomon's
[1:11:27] son Riaboam.
[1:11:29] He said that my father chastised you
[1:11:31] with whips, but I will chastise you with
[1:11:34] scorpions. I'm going to be hard on you.
[1:11:38] But this man
[1:11:40] Saul, he was kind and he said, "No, just
[1:11:43] leave them
[1:11:44] alone."
[1:11:47] Really, any ruler of of any sort, there
[1:11:51] will always be children of Blay that
[1:11:54] criticize and don't help in any way. But
[1:11:57] I think that we should always take the
[1:12:00] attitude that Saul originally had and
[1:12:03] just leave them alone. You don't have to
[1:12:06] chastise someone from the pulpit. You
[1:12:07] don't have to chastise someone publicly.
[1:12:09] Just leave them alone. Every there
[1:12:12] they'll always be there. Whether it's
[1:12:14] our president, how thin Scandi is and
[1:12:17] and you know, someone will tweet and
[1:12:19] they tweet back and forth. It's like
[1:12:21] just just leave it, you know, just just
[1:12:24] let it go.
[1:12:26] So the um so Saul is now
[1:12:30] king.
[1:12:32] Now the uh there's this king that rises
[1:12:36] up this this Ammonite. The children of
[1:12:39] Ammon, they come from this man Lot. So
[1:12:43] you remember Abraham and his nephew Lot.
[1:12:45] Lot came out of Sodom. Sodom was
[1:12:49] destroyed. His wife turns to a pillar of
[1:12:51] salt. They they go up and they hide out
[1:12:54] in the in the mountains and the Lot ends
[1:12:58] up sleeping with his daughters and they
[1:13:01] have one each daughter has a son. One is
[1:13:04] named Ammon. The other one in the other
[1:13:06] one's name is Moab and that's where the
[1:13:09] Ammonites and the Moabites come from.
[1:13:11] And they were constantly at war with
[1:13:13] Israel.
[1:13:14] So this
[1:13:17] man, this Ammonite called Nahash was his
[1:13:21] name, he brings an army to this
[1:13:26] city and he besieges this
[1:13:29] city
[1:13:31] and they the um the the people in the
[1:13:36] city, they reach out to this man, this
[1:13:41] conquering man that's going to about to
[1:13:43] about to take their city and they say,
[1:13:45] "Hey, can
[1:13:46] um can we make a deal and then we'll
[1:13:50] serve you?" And this man, Nahash, evil
[1:13:55] man, he says, "Okay, we can make a
[1:13:58] deal." He says, "I will gouge out the
[1:14:02] right eye of every one of you to be a
[1:14:05] reproach on Israel. How's that for a
[1:14:08] deal? Then you can serve me."
[1:14:11] And they were like, "Uh, can we have
[1:14:15] seven days to think about
[1:14:18] it?" And they sent out
[1:14:21] messengers to help
[1:14:24] them.
[1:14:27] Saul, it starts getting among the people
[1:14:30] and then in Saul's
[1:14:32] hometown, he hears the people crying and
[1:14:36] he says, he says, "Why are the people
[1:14:38] crying?" And they tell him the whole
[1:14:40] story about
[1:14:42] Nahash. Now this is the king of Israel.
[1:14:44] Now remember, Israel is used to getting
[1:14:49] destroyed by any invading
[1:14:52] army. And that's why they they were so
[1:14:54] quick to say, "Hey, let's make a deal."
[1:14:55] And he's like, "Okay, I'm going to gouge
[1:14:57] out your right eyes and then you can
[1:14:58] serve me." And they're like, "Uh,
[1:15:02] well, let us think about it." What they
[1:15:05] said. and they sent people out to get
[1:15:08] help. Finally, it gets to the king. It
[1:15:12] gets to the
[1:15:14] leader. Let's read it. Chapter 11, we'll
[1:15:18] just start with verse one. Then Nahash
[1:15:21] the Ammonite came up and encamped
[1:15:23] against Jabeshgilead. And all the men of
[1:15:25] Jabesh said unto Nahash, "Make a
[1:15:28] covenant with us and we will serve you."
[1:15:31] So the Jewish people at Jabeshgilead,
[1:15:34] they were used to getting
[1:15:36] conquered. So they wanted to make peace.
[1:15:39] We'll pay you off. And Nahash the
[1:15:42] Ammonite answered, "On this condition,
[1:15:44] will I make a covenant with you that I
[1:15:47] may thrust all out all your right eyes
[1:15:49] and lay it for reproach upon all
[1:15:52] Israel." Oh, you want to make a deal,
[1:15:54] huh? Those are my those are my terms.
[1:15:58] And the elders of Jabesh said unto him,
[1:16:01] "Give us seven days respit that we may
[1:16:03] send managers unto all the coasts of
[1:16:05] Israel. And then if there be no man to
[1:16:07] save us, we will come out to
[1:16:10] thee." And and then came the messengers
[1:16:13] to Giba of Saul, and told the tidings
[1:16:16] and the ears of the people, and all the
[1:16:18] people lifted up their voices, and wept.
[1:16:20] And behold, Saul came after the came
[1:16:23] after the herd out of the field. And
[1:16:26] Saul said, "What alth the people that
[1:16:28] weep?" And they told them the tidings of
[1:16:30] the men of
[1:16:31] Jabesh. And the spirit of God came upon
[1:16:35] Saul when he heard those tidings. And
[1:16:38] his anger was greatly kindled. And he
[1:16:41] took an a yolk of oxen and hewed them in
[1:16:43] pieces and sent them throughout all the
[1:16:45] coast of Israel by the hands of
[1:16:47] messengers, saying, "Whosoever cometh
[1:16:49] not forth after Saul, and after Samuel,
[1:16:53] so shall it be done unto this oxen." And
[1:16:56] the fear of the Lord fell upon all the
[1:16:58] people, and they came out in one
[1:17:00] consent. So Saul said, "Listen, we are
[1:17:04] going to battle and if you don't come,
[1:17:07] all of you 12 tribes, if you don't come
[1:17:10] and follow me into the battle, then
[1:17:12] you're going to be like this ox that I
[1:17:13] just cut up." He showed leadership
[1:17:18] there. And when he numbered them in Ba
[1:17:21] in Bez, the children of Israel, there
[1:17:24] were
[1:17:24] 300,000, and the men of Judah 30,000.
[1:17:28] And they said unto the messengers that
[1:17:30] came, thus shall ye say unto the men of
[1:17:32] Jabes Gilead, tomorrow by that time the
[1:17:36] the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And
[1:17:39] the messengers came down and showed it
[1:17:41] to the people to the men of Jabesh. And
[1:17:43] they were glad. So they sent messengers
[1:17:45] and said, "Tomorrow we're going to be
[1:17:47] there and we're going to bail you out.
[1:17:49] Here comes the Calvary."
[1:17:56] Therefore the men of Jabesh said,
[1:17:58] "Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and
[1:18:00] ye shall do with us all that seemth good
[1:18:03] to you." Now watch the leadership of
[1:18:05] Saul. He shows that he can lead in
[1:18:08] battle. And it was on the marorrow that
[1:18:11] Saul put the people in three companies.
[1:18:13] And they came into the midst of the host
[1:18:16] in the morning watch, and slew the
[1:18:18] Ammonites until the heat of the day. And
[1:18:20] it came to pass that they which remained
[1:18:23] were scattered so that two of them were
[1:18:25] not left together. And the people said
[1:18:28] unto Samuel, Who is he that said, "Shall
[1:18:32] Saul reign over us? Bring the men that
[1:18:34] we may put them to death." Remember the
[1:18:38] sons of children of Bile, the sons of
[1:18:40] Balile. It's like, "Oh, do you remember
[1:18:42] they were talking about you? You Saul."
[1:18:49] And Saul said, "There shall not a man be
[1:18:53] put to death this day, for today the
[1:18:56] Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel."
[1:18:59] Then said Samuel to the people, "Come,
[1:19:02] let us go to Gil Gilgal and renew the
[1:19:04] kingdom there." And all the people went
[1:19:07] to Gilgal. And there they made Saul king
[1:19:10] before the before the Lord in
[1:19:13] Gilgal. Second time. Now Saul was proven
[1:19:17] in battle.
[1:19:19] And there they
[1:19:21] sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings
[1:19:24] before the Lord. And there Saul and all
[1:19:26] the men of Israel rejoiced
[1:19:30] greatly. So we see this man Saul. I'll
[1:19:33] um we'll we'll stop there. The musicians
[1:19:36] can come and close. You see this man
[1:19:40] Saul, he started out very very
[1:19:42] good, very brave. I love that part when
[1:19:47] he hears that his people are in trouble
[1:19:51] and he says, "You know what? We're all
[1:19:54] going to to bail them out." That had
[1:19:56] never really happened in Israel before.
[1:19:59] And now this king shows that God is with
[1:20:02] them. And he gets all the people
[1:20:03] together. And here they go to conquer
[1:20:06] this
[1:20:07] guy that was about to do these awful
[1:20:10] things to their brethren. And we see
[1:20:13] this man
[1:20:14] Saul was leading them into battle. A
[1:20:18] truly great man. But soon things will
[1:20:23] begin to
[1:20:24] change. And this
[1:20:27] power in
[1:20:30] Saul will start to
[1:20:32] turn to
[1:20:34] pride. And then this pride will turn to
[1:20:38] jealousy. And then all of these problems
[1:20:42] that Saul has, they start to work on his
[1:20:45] mind and they start to trouble him and
[1:20:49] they really they make his life
[1:20:52] miserable from this from this is the
[1:20:56] highlight in Saul's career. This is the
[1:20:59] best that it gets and he's going to win
[1:21:01] some more battles and we'll get to that
[1:21:02] in the next time we get to Saul.
[1:21:05] But it'll he'll soon start making
[1:21:07] mistakes and he'll st soon soon start
[1:21:10] relying on Saul more than he relies on
[1:21:13] the
[1:21:13] Lord. God bless you
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:25] Michael upon the

[1:21:52] faint. Teach me
[1:21:55] Lord, teach me
[1:21:57] Lord to way.
[1:22:03] Teach me
[1:22:05] Lord to
[1:22:08] wait down on my
[1:22:12] knees. Tell in your own good
[1:22:17] time. You'll
[1:22:19] answer my please.
[1:22:22] Teach me
[1:22:24] not to
[1:22:26] rely on
[1:22:29] what others
[1:22:31] do, but to
[1:22:34] wait in prayer for an
[1:22:39] answer from
[1:22:41] you. For they that wait upon the
[1:22:46] Lord shall
[1:22:48] renew their strength.
[1:22:52] They shall mount up with
[1:22:56] wings as

[1:23:19] wait. will teach me
[1:23:23] Lord to
[1:23:25] wave while hearts are a

[1:23:32] humble my
[1:23:35] pride and call on your
[1:23:39] name. Keep my
[1:23:42] faith
[1:23:43] renewed and keep my
[1:23:46] eyes on me.

[1:24:18] They shall run and not be
[1:24:22] weery. They shall walk and not
[1:24:26] faint. Teach me Lord. Oh, teach me
[1:24:31] Lord to
[1:24:35] wait. I really think the story of King
[1:24:39] Saul is the most tragic story in the Old
[1:24:42] Testament.
[1:24:43] We see what a tremendous potential that
[1:24:47] this man had. He had every
[1:24:51] character that we would think that a
[1:24:53] king should have, but
[1:24:57] yet
[1:24:59] he let it get to his
[1:25:02] head. Later on, we'll see that his whole
[1:25:06] character
[1:25:07] changed when power corrupted him.
[1:25:11] But before that, he truly was a great
[1:25:14] man. Boy, just the battles and the
[1:25:18] leadership that he showed in Israel
[1:25:21] really hadn't been seen until since
[1:25:25] Joshua's
[1:25:26] time. And he got them together and he
[1:25:30] said, "We're going to battle. And if
[1:25:32] you're going to chicken out, I'm coming
[1:25:33] after you after the battle." Just a
[1:25:36] tremendous leader. Wonderful leader.
[1:25:38] Let's all stand.
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:46] Teach me
[1:25:47] Lord to
[1:25:51] wait down on my
[1:25:55] knees till in your own good
[1:26:00] time. You'll
[1:26:02] answer my please.
[1:26:05] Teach me
[1:26:07] not to
[1:26:09] rely on what others
[1:26:14] do, but to
[1:26:16] wait in prayer for an answer from you.
[1:26:24] All they that wait upon the
[1:26:28] Lord shall
[1:26:31] renew their strength.
[1:26:34] They shall mount up with wings
[1:26:39] as
[1:26:42] eagles. They shall run and not be
[1:26:47] weery. They shall walk and not
[1:26:52] faint. Teach me Lord or teach me
[1:26:57] Lord to
[1:27:00] way. Very important week this week as we
[1:27:04] prepare for a communion service on
[1:27:07] Sunday
[1:27:08] evening. Keep that in
[1:27:11] prayer. The scripture that we read
[1:27:13] during every communion service that
[1:27:15] says, "Let a man examine himself." So
[1:27:18] let us examine ourselves this week. Make
[1:27:21] sure that we are right with the Lord.
[1:27:23] When we come and take the cup and the
[1:27:27] bread, we want to be worthy. We'll never
[1:27:30] be worthy maybe in our own eyes, but we
[1:27:33] want to be right. We want our heart to
[1:27:36] be right to where we can say, "Lord, I
[1:27:39] make a lot of mistakes, but you know my
[1:27:41] heart and in my heart I truly want to be
[1:27:43] a
[1:27:44] Christian." Then on this coming Saturday
[1:27:48] afternoon, Saturday evening at 3:00, we
[1:27:51] have a um have a potluck at UD Doll Park
[1:27:55] and that's for everybody. The youth are
[1:27:57] planning it and they're organizing it,
[1:28:00] but it's for all of us. We can all we
[1:28:03] can all go and
[1:28:09] um I think that's
[1:28:12] it. Zach and Zeke, may God be with you
[1:28:16] on your
[1:28:17] traveling. May his Holy Spirit be in the
[1:28:20] vehicle with you and guide you and
[1:28:22] protect you. And
[1:28:25] I pray that when you get back home that
[1:28:29] the Lord will bless you there and that
[1:28:32] you will
[1:28:34] u find the desire of your heart. And
[1:28:37] remember, the closer you get to
[1:28:41] God, the more you want to be closer to
[1:28:43] him. As you get closer and
[1:28:46] closer, the greater he is. And the
[1:28:49] closer you get, the closer you want to
[1:28:51] be. Let's bow our heads.
[1:28:54] Our
[1:28:56] father, we thank you Lord that you have
[1:28:59] preserved these
[1:29:01] stories in the
[1:29:04] Bible and Lord
[1:29:06] that we can see great
[1:29:08] men in the past and and how they rose up
[1:29:12] to power and Lord how you were with
[1:29:16] them. The same
[1:29:19] God that was with Saul and changed him
[1:29:22] is the same God that's here with us. The
[1:29:24] same God that was with David is the same
[1:29:27] God that's here with us. Same God that
[1:29:28] was in Moses is the same God that's here
[1:29:31] with us. And Father, we want to speak to
[1:29:34] you like Samuel spoke to
[1:29:36] you. Be with us, Father, we pray.
[1:29:39] guide us, protect us, prepare our
[1:29:42] hearts, Father, for this communion
[1:29:44] service this Sunday. And we pray that
[1:29:47] you would bless the
[1:29:50] gathering we'll have on Saturday. And
[1:29:53] Father, bless each one that's here
[1:29:54] tonight, those that streamed in. May
[1:29:56] your your hand be upon them in Jesus
[1:29:59] name. Amen.
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:07] The love of
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:12] God is
[1:30:14] greater
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] far than tongue or
[1:30:25] pin. Can't ever tell.
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:33] It goes
[1:30:38] beyond the highest
[1:30:44] star and reaches
[1:30:50] to the
[1:30:53] lowest hell.
[1:30:58] The guilty
[1:31:03] pair bound down with care.
[1:31:10] God gave his
[1:31:16] son to
[1:31:22] win his airing child.
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:29] He
[1:31:34] reconciled and pardoned
[1:31:41] from his sin.
[1:31:47] All love of
[1:31:52] God, how rich and
[1:31:59] pure, how
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:05] measureless and strong.
[1:32:12] It shall
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:17] forever more
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:23] endure the saints and
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:29] a gent song.
[1:32:36] And we
[1:32:41] within the ocean
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:46] filled and were the
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:52] skies a part
[1:32:59] made where every
[1:33:05] Star on earth a
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:11] quill and every
[1:33:16] man ascribe by
[1:33:22] trade to write the
[1:33:28] love of God above.
[1:33:35] would drain the
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:42] o
[1:33:45] dry, nor can the
[1:33:49] [Music]
[1:33:51] scroll contain the
[1:33:57] whole stretched from sky.
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:07] song we most of us know that I don't
[1:34:10] know who the author of that song is. I
[1:34:13] know that it was scribed on a the wall
[1:34:16] of an insane
[1:34:18] institution. I remember
[1:34:20] that I just start going to church when I
[1:34:23] was a young man. I was uh I was maybe I
[1:34:27] don't know 21 years
[1:34:29] old and we were singing that chorus. We
[1:34:33] were singing that
[1:34:34] song and when we got to the part about
[1:34:39] to write the love of
[1:34:42] God, I uh I was we're at brother
[1:34:46] Makanda's church just down the street,
[1:34:48] not too far from here. Very I don't know
[1:34:50] if you ever been to that church. Very
[1:34:51] quiet, more quiet than we are. and uh
[1:34:55] just a
[1:34:56] real you know nonemotional church and we
[1:35:00] got to that part and I started
[1:35:03] shouting and I started clapping and
[1:35:07] there was probably 15 people in the
[1:35:10] whole service that
[1:35:11] night and they everybody looked at me
[1:35:14] like whoa they were they were good with
[1:35:16] it like like oh good you know and I had
[1:35:20] nothing ever happened to me like that in
[1:35:22] my whole
[1:35:23] and and I was shouting and praising the
[1:35:25] Lord and clapping and and then after her
[1:35:28] words I like
[1:35:32] whoa that that really happened. Can we
[1:35:35] sing it that verse one more time? It's
[1:35:38] just special to me.
[1:35:42] And we with
[1:35:47] thee the ocean
[1:35:52] feel and were the
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:35:58] skies a part been
[1:36:04] made where every
[1:36:10] Star on earth a
