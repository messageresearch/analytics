[40:19] of all things
[40:21] amen

[41:58] in other words he's alpha and omega amen
[42:03] let's turn to psalms 45
[42:08] and verse 5.
[42:11] thereby saying amen
[42:15] i'm sorry isaiah 45 i said songs didn't

[42:35] there is no god
[42:37] besides me
[42:38] i girder thee
[42:40] though thou has not known
[42:42] me that they may know
[42:46] from the rising of the sun
[42:48] and from the west that there is none
[42:51] besides me
[42:52] i am the lord and there is none
[42:56] else well that's that's reverence eddie
[42:58] that that's your brain consolation and
[43:01] your spirit amen
[43:03] i formed light
[43:05] i create darkness
[43:08] i make peace
[43:10] and create evil
[43:12] are you saying that god is evil
[43:15] no that's in everything everything has
[43:18] to come before god
[43:20] amen
[43:21] i the lord do all
[43:24] these
[43:25] things
[43:26] amen listen by his again father lord
[43:29] jesus we thank you for the reading of
[43:31] your holy word now sanctify it to our
[43:34] soul this reacts in jesus name amen and
[43:37] you may take your seat
[43:40] praise the lord
[43:41] we like to by the help of the lord
[43:44] uh we we look at exodus
[43:48] uh we got a few things
[43:50] i i'm sure i hope that it'll be a help
[43:54] to you
[43:56] that it will relieve
[43:57] your comforts amen and you really
[44:01] have
[44:02] more faith in god
[44:05] and you'll know that who is running
[44:08] everything
[44:09] there's nothing on the earth that can
[44:12] move that god don't know about
[44:15] our god is all wise he's all-knowing he
[44:19] know every fleet that hops god even
[44:22] knows every hair that is on your head
[44:25] god is acquainted with all of your
[44:27] thoughts he knows how thoughts are false
[44:29] so what is it that god don't know
[44:33] so we want you to realize that god
[44:35] controls
[44:37] everything somebody say everything
[44:40] and my thought to this evening is the
[44:42] sovereignty of god
[44:45] the sovereignty of god we look at the
[44:48] sovereignty god and who is controlling
[44:52] our earth affairs
[44:54] let us find out what says the scripture
[44:57] and the prophet the definition of the
[44:59] word
[45:00] sovereignty is one who abide the law
[45:04] and who has no governing body
[45:07] a king who's ruled sovereignly
[45:10] sovereignly from his dictate of his own
[45:13] heart whatever the king desire that's
[45:16] the way it would go
[45:17] and whoever decision is final
[45:22] oh my
[45:24] as the darkness around us depend
[45:28] and man learn more and more and man lean
[45:30] more and more to the glorification of
[45:34] themself rather than christ
[45:38] the needs grows more urgent for the
[45:40] teaching that the prophet preached the
[45:43] message the sovereignty of god
[45:47] many will confess that god rules the
[45:50] heavens
[45:52] but for the most part his rulership on
[45:55] earth is out doubt or outright denied
[45:58] why the modern intellectual
[46:01] uh thinker pushed more the creator and
[46:04] more into the background
[46:09] that's why we thank god today
[46:11] that god sent us a prophet and allowed
[46:14] us to see
[46:16] that god
[46:17] is a god that sits high and he looks low
[46:21] and he sees everything
[46:24] don't you think not one moment that god
[46:27] don't see everything
[46:30] and sometimes we feel like well lord
[46:33] don't you see what's going on
[46:35] god is not sleep god never sleeps
[46:38] he sees everything he even told us he
[46:42] said lord i am with you always
[46:46] in your darkest moment i am with you
[46:50] where do you think god was at when the
[46:52] hebrew boys had to walk into the fiery
[46:56] furnish
[46:57] he was already in there
[47:00] so he already sees he already knows
[47:03] every trial that you have to go through
[47:05] god already know those things
[47:08] can the church say amen
[47:11] so we look in our bibles
[47:14] as we return to
[47:15] uh exodus
[47:18] amen exodus the seventh chapter
[47:22] and we begin to look at exodus 7 chapter
[47:25] 1 through 6
[47:28] are we there by saying amen
[47:32] and it reads
[47:33] and the lord said
[47:35] unto
[47:36] moses see i have made thee
[47:40] a god
[47:41] to pharaoh
[47:43] and aaron thy brother shall be
[47:46] thy what
[47:47] prophet
[47:49] in other word a mouthpiece now this
[47:52] wasn't uh a president
[47:55] uh there wasn't uh some dictator but
[47:57] this was god telling moses i'm gonna
[48:01] make you a god
[48:03] and i'm gonna make your brother aaron
[48:06] he's going to be a prophet
[48:08] and that's right verse 2 and he says
[48:11] god shall speak all that i have
[48:14] commanded thee
[48:15] and aaron thy brother shall speak unto
[48:18] pharaoh and he send the children of
[48:22] israel out of the land
[48:24] oh my so the question is
[48:27] when
[48:28] well what god told
[48:31] moses when you go down there so can you
[48:34] imagine can i just paraphrase a little
[48:36] bit can you imagine i don't know was it
[48:39] day or night or god spoke to moses and
[48:42] moses go tell his brother era aaron
[48:46] we're going down to egypt and everyone's
[48:48] like okay because so you know brother
[48:51] brown will say that back in those days
[48:54] moses going down to egypt it was like
[48:57] going down to russia
[48:59] one man invasion but moses telling his
[49:01] brother look we're going down to egypt
[49:05] and god told me brother and aaron said
[49:08] okay i'm listen he said god told me
[49:12] i'm going to be god
[49:14] and you're going to be like oh the
[49:17] prophet
[49:18] and whatever i
[49:20] point you you know i said dust to the
[49:22] lord so we're going to work together and
[49:25] and aaron like wow brother are you sure
[49:28] about this yes i know it's god i know
[49:31] his voice how many you ever hear his
[49:32] voice and that's why you could move
[49:34] because i i know god told me that
[49:36] somebody said i don't know about that
[49:38] but i know god told me god told me to do
[49:41] this and i'm going to do it with
[49:42] confidence but then moses
[49:45] and aaron got together and i can imagine
[49:49] moses might have told his wife to poor
[49:52] amen we're going down to egypt honey uh
[49:55] we're going to settle our donkey and and
[49:58] we're going down there but moses was so
[50:00] excited about going down to egypt that
[50:03] he was going to
[50:04] in the presence of god and his son
[50:06] wasn't circumcised
[50:08] and sometimes we try to go in the
[50:10] presence of god and the heart is not
[50:12] circumcised
[50:14] your heart got to be circumcised so
[50:17] moses and aaron going down to egypt i
[50:20] could imagine going there and there
[50:23] they're thinking what they're going to
[50:24] say moses said you know man i'm a little
[50:27] nervous i've never done this before but
[50:29] i know it was god
[50:31] god told me to speak thus said the lord
[50:35] let my people go
[50:38] oh my oh my so i can imagine in their
[50:41] mind they know it's exactly how this
[50:43] thing going to play out
[50:45] moses is going to wave his hand and and
[50:48] moses is going to speak thus says the
[50:49] lord and his brother aaron's going to be
[50:51] standing there and the people gonna be
[50:53] amazed and
[50:54] and pharaoh gonna back up with his
[50:57] magicians and oh it's gonna be a time
[50:59] and that's the way we always got a
[51:01] picture in our mind how this thing's
[51:03] supposed to play out you know
[51:06] and you know and we have no idea how
[51:09] this body is going to change but we do
[51:11] know that we're going to be changed in a
[51:13] moment of a twinkling of an eye i have
[51:16] no idea what it's going to be like when
[51:18] i go back to be about 20 years old but i
[51:21] believe that but i just got off you know
[51:23] i just in my mind my little puny mind
[51:26] goes so far let's go blink
[51:30] we try to understand god we try to we
[51:34] need to
[51:35] let god
[51:36] handle his business
[51:41] you know you know as i get into my my
[51:45] lesson
[51:46] i i thought of the sovereignty of god
[51:49] you know and and i'm not into politic
[51:52] but you know during the time of the 44th
[51:56] president that was wrestling and and not
[51:58] to vote him and not to have and somebody
[52:01] said no i don't care when you cast your
[52:03] vote
[52:05] it's god
[52:07] that is controlling
[52:09] everything
[52:11] you say i got to get off of work early i
[52:12] got i got to go to the pool go to the
[52:14] phone
[52:16] god already know who's going to be
[52:18] president
[52:20] that's that's the that's the writing of
[52:22] the pale horse rider are you with me so
[52:26] god knows who's going to be president
[52:29] god know what president is going to be
[52:31] in the office to open the door to the
[52:34] same sex marriage and not a thing we
[52:37] could do about it
[52:39] somebody said well i didn't vote for him
[52:40] you don't have to
[52:43] god already got it figured out so what
[52:45] we need to do is lay back and relax and
[52:48] let god
[52:49] run his business
[52:52] can the whole church say amen
[52:54] i'm talking about the whole church now
[52:57] amen if we would just let god handle his
[53:00] business and just just relax
[53:03] this you know the prophet of god said in
[53:06] the in the church in the seal book he
[53:08] said don't try to manufacture nothing
[53:11] now just just walk just just just come
[53:14] to church
[53:15] this this place that sang just amen and
[53:18] when god get ready
[53:20] it's not on our time it's when god
[53:24] get ready we try to hurry up god we we
[53:27] come and we try to figure out oh i
[53:28] believe god's going to do how do you
[53:30] know
[53:31] god got everything scheduled and
[53:34] everything's going my fact the prophet
[53:36] of god says there's nothing oh this
[53:40] ought to bless you now that the prophet
[53:42] of god said there's nothing out of cater
[53:47] you say brother children you just don't
[53:48] know how i said there's nothing
[53:51] out of catered
[53:53] the prophet of god said there's nothing
[53:56] that can happen to a christian
[53:59] how many christians in here
[54:01] that god has an intent you say i don't
[54:03] know but you don't believe your bible
[54:05] that's why apostle paul said that romans
[54:09] 8 28
[54:10] or 28 uh paul says
[54:13] all things
[54:16] know some things brother should you just
[54:17] don't understand when i go all things
[54:20] you know let me tell you what and i i've
[54:21] heard people get this pity pad we got we
[54:24] got to stop that you don't know what i'm
[54:25] going through you look look you ought to
[54:28] be happy you going through something i
[54:31] know some people are stuck and can't go
[54:33] through
[54:34] you ought to be happy i'm going through
[54:36] my trial brother brother children the
[54:38] fire trials that i'm going i thank god i
[54:40] have the opportunity to go through my
[54:43] trial and every one of my child come
[54:45] before me god put them there to build
[54:48] character
[54:50] by sometimes we want to tell god how how
[54:54] we want things to how we want to lay it
[54:56] out god i want to be like this and i
[54:58] want the church to be this way i want
[55:00] everybody just to like me oh you forget
[55:03] that
[55:04] god got everything in control
[55:07] you know i can imagine well you know i
[55:10] think that the bible said uh god uh i i
[55:13] can't remember whether job or one of the
[55:15] someone said that doll the potter
[55:19] right and i'm just to clay
[55:21] how many products is in here
[55:25] how many clays are in here
[55:27] so what is the problem
[55:29] so we're trying to tell god god takes
[55:32] you and he twisted you all
[55:34] you try to tell god god oh god
[55:38] lord you about to break it you know what
[55:39] he's doing
[55:41] he's made you and he knows exactly what
[55:44] you need to be a character all of us
[55:46] don't go through the same thing god
[55:49] allows things to happen because he's
[55:51] building character
[55:54] if i have gone through some of the trial
[55:57] that i'm going man some of the trials i
[55:59] go through is fiery trials my
[56:02] if i could tell you you would say what
[56:05] but you know what it does it made me a
[56:07] better christian
[56:09] it taught me how to love my enemies
[56:13] it taught me how to love those that
[56:16] persecute me and say all evil against me
[56:19] i realize if there's any evil in this
[56:21] city has not the lord god done it
[56:26] all things work together for the good
[56:30] god is a mercy for god let me just throw
[56:33] this in i just feel the present lord
[56:35] here i was just thinking i was just
[56:37] listening out of tape the other day when
[56:38] brother bradley was going out to kill
[56:40] that animal and that biscuit was with
[56:43] them y'all know where i'm going right ed
[56:45] bishop was with him but brother browning
[56:47] the vision saw an ed biscuit with a what
[56:51] a plaid shirt right but when brother
[56:53] brown saw ed biska ed biska didn't hat
[56:56] on a plaid shirt huh but oh listen to me
[57:00] church ed bischo
[57:02] amen later on as brother brownlee got
[57:05] father ed biscuit was behind oh church
[57:08] of the living god don't tell me god is
[57:12] concerned about his word amen amen
[57:15] god vision
[57:17] amen when the prophet spoke thus saith
[57:19] the lord it's not the prophet it's god
[57:23] well somehow the sovereignty of god
[57:27] he runs his own business
[57:29] he had ed biska somewhere behind
[57:33] but who told ed biscuit to put that
[57:36] plaid shirt in there
[57:39] the plaid shirt was in there the prophet
[57:41] saw the individual a plaid shirt a
[57:43] biscuit in the hat on a plaid shirt
[57:47] but somehow ed biscuit i think was
[57:49] crossing over a log or something and he
[57:52] fell in some water whatever and he had
[57:54] to change his shirt but when ed biska
[57:56] came in the presence of our prophet
[58:00] he said hey i thought you it said well
[58:02] my wife must have put it in there it was
[58:04] god
[58:06] it's trying to show you god said look
[58:08] i'm running this business
[58:10] you said lord i don't know i don't know
[58:13] what what's going to become our church
[58:14] just relax
[58:17] i'm not going to get my blood pressure
[58:19] up high amen just relax get yourself all
[58:23] worried and for what
[58:26] you know why why should you worry be
[58:28] happy
[58:30] you know if if god god is in control
[58:33] lord i need to straighten this out let's
[58:35] let god
[58:37] handle
[58:38] everything
[58:40] can the whole church say the whole
[58:41] church now
[58:45] moses
[58:47] and everyone
[58:48] goes down there
[58:50] and moses
[58:52] goes in the presence of
[58:54] a pharaoh and i can't imagine king
[58:57] pharaoh sitting on his throne
[58:59] with his wise man and his servant
[59:01] they're all sitting there just fanning
[59:03] him and can you imagine the door swings
[59:06] open and the guard's standing there and
[59:08] and moses come through with a dried up
[59:11] old stick in his hand
[59:15] amen going before king pharaoh
[59:18] but moses had thus said the lord now the
[59:21] reason moses went with i don't drive
[59:23] upstairs because he just knew when he go
[59:25] there and he poured his hand the truly
[59:28] israel will start coming
[59:30] that's what he thought
[59:33] and that's what we think
[59:35] we put
[59:36] you know i remember people just do their
[59:38] math and you know i remember in 96 they
[59:41] used to do their math and this plus that
[59:43] and that and this this this and over
[59:45] here according to that it looked like
[59:47] it's going to happen in 96 and we're
[59:49] still here
[59:52] god got his own time
[59:54] god's got his own time only thing i know
[59:56] it's going to be a few
[59:58] i do know one thing it won't be many
[1:00:00] that he'll put up there but i declare
[1:00:02] before god i'm going to be one of them
[1:00:04] that he adopted amen that's why i could
[1:00:07] go through my trial and hold my head up
[1:00:09] i ain't mad with nobody

[1:02:46] drawing nigh we we're getting ready to
[1:02:49] leave church
[1:02:50] yeah it won't be long there's pressure
[1:02:53] precious build character

[1:10:11] that's what we got to do we got to get
[1:10:14] in the will of god when moses went down
[1:10:16] there when moses said let there be flies
[1:10:19] and let there be fleas

[1:11:46] it's always accomplished maybe it's not
[1:11:48] for you but somebody needs to hear this
[1:11:52] somebody trying to take things in your
[1:11:54] own hand you can't handle it i can't
[1:11:57] handle it amen we have to put it all in
[1:12:00] the hand of the almighty god and while
[1:12:03] we down here let's go pick up pilate one
[1:12:05] time
[1:12:06] pilot was in the judgment hall and he
[1:12:08] had this little man about six feet tall
[1:12:11] about a hundred and thirty pounds and
[1:12:13] paula talking to him and probably say oh
[1:12:15] hold your head up i'm talking to you
[1:12:19] and jesus had his head he said look do
[1:12:21] you know
[1:12:23] that i personal pronoun i have the power
[1:12:26] do you know i can have you crucified do
[1:12:28] you know i'm the governor
[1:12:31] i can have you crucified i
[1:12:34] i got the power but what jesus look at
[1:12:37] him
[1:12:38] luke 19 and 10.
[1:12:41] uh uh jesus looked up in
[1:12:43] paula's eyes and historically and said
[1:12:46] when jesus looked in the eyes of poland
[1:12:48] that governor he dropped his head
[1:12:51] because he was looking in the very eyes
[1:12:54] of the creator
[1:12:56] and paula
[1:12:58] told him you know i got the power
[1:13:01] and that's the way mans are
[1:13:03] think that hit running thing you know
[1:13:06] i'm gonna run things i'm i'm gonna you
[1:13:08] can't do nothing

[1:13:13] lady to be the president the vice
[1:13:14] president she would have never got in
[1:13:16] the chair
[1:13:18] you can you do all you want it's god
[1:13:21] controlling everything
[1:13:23] hallelujah and paula told jesus i have
[1:13:27] power and jesus told him what you don't
[1:13:29] he said let me tell you something you
[1:13:31] don't have no power
[1:13:33] no power whatsoever except it was given
[1:13:37] from above see little that pilot knew
[1:13:41] that the very man he was talking to was
[1:13:44] already slain in the mind of god
[1:13:46] how can you go to hell when you already
[1:13:48] god saw you on the other side
[1:13:52] so why should you worry

[1:22:14] up here don't you amen but it's the god
[1:22:16] of heaven true who is man or thou
[1:22:18] mindful there ain't no holy man there
[1:22:21] ain't no holy church it's a holy god
[1:22:23] that's in the church ain't no holy
[1:22:25] mountain my son was on fire because god
[1:22:29] came down and wasn't for the holy ghost
[1:22:31] may i won't be worth a a dime
[1:22:36] but this man got lifted up got pride
[1:22:38] within himself
[1:22:40] he got lifted up and he they're going

[1:23:44] can save you
[1:23:46] god god never did intend for man to run
[1:23:50] a church
[1:23:54] why do you think why you think churches
[1:23:56] in a mess what they are today
[1:23:58] because man got their little ideas
[1:24:00] that's why the prophet of god said in
[1:24:03] the seal book page 19 it might have
[1:24:05] changed but he said see only what the
[1:24:07] tape said and i'm not talking about a
[1:24:09] tape ministry
[1:24:10] that's why we got to stay with what the
[1:24:12] prophet said that's why i don't want no
[1:24:14] other commentary telling me nothing
[1:24:17] i want to say what dust said to the lord
[1:24:19] that's who i want to listen at that's
[1:24:21] who i want to play in my house
[1:24:25] yeah
[1:24:26] td jakes can't tell me nothing
[1:24:29] huh
[1:24:30] somebody what what the benny hand could
[1:24:33] tell me
[1:24:34] are you hearing me
[1:24:35] are you hearing me what old robbers
[1:24:37] could tell me amen i need to hear the
[1:24:40] voice for my day that's why i get
[1:24:42] raptured in faith can somebody say amen
[1:24:45] see all that other stuff amen
[1:24:48] it might be a stomach it stepped me to
[1:24:50] the next place but the bible said in the
[1:24:53] days of the voice
[1:24:55] of the seventh danger i told my wife i
[1:24:58] said it's okay to listen that different
[1:25:00] ministry if you want to listen that but
[1:25:02] you better make sure you stay with
[1:25:05] that tape teaching
[1:25:10] but somebody would have their own idea
[1:25:12] but god
[1:25:14] is running everything
[1:25:16] so moses moses goes up to pharaoh
[1:25:20] let my people go and and pharaoh's
[1:25:22] sitting there
[1:25:23] and with all his musicians
[1:25:26] right there
[1:25:28] and moses says
[1:25:30] let my people go for
[1:25:36] who told you all this god
[1:25:39] he said who is god
[1:25:42] well that's mighty strong and
[1:25:44] mo pharaoh say i know not god
[1:25:48] and moses almost saying what you're
[1:25:49] going to find out his error thrown
[1:25:52] around the rod boy everyone was glad
[1:25:54] everyone threw that as raw and it turned
[1:25:56] to a serpent
[1:25:58] and impersonators yes what moses did
[1:26:02] james jamboree
[1:26:04] boys throw your stick down
[1:26:06] throw this stick down it turned to a
[1:26:08] serpent but you remember they had a copy
[1:26:10] off of the original are you hearing me
[1:26:13] amen so what happened amen
[1:26:16] moses think swallow up theirs
[1:26:20] they'll stick amen but when moses go
[1:26:23] down there and say let my people go so
[1:26:27] moses just know any moment
[1:26:30] man the people gonna start crowding in
[1:26:32] this in this
[1:26:33] in this stadium we're gonna start
[1:26:34] leaving we're going to get men women
[1:26:36] babies and girls and horses and camels
[1:26:39] we're going to go back to the homeland
[1:26:41] we're going out of here
[1:26:43] but then more god told moses moses
[1:26:46] walking away god said moses moses hold
[1:26:48] up we'll say yes yes yes lord he said
[1:26:51] i'm not going to let him go i'm not
[1:26:53] going to let him go
[1:26:55] i'm going to harden his heart
[1:26:59] you said
[1:27:01] moses well what's the use
[1:27:04] i went all the way down there
[1:27:07] burn my energy as the young people said
[1:27:09] burying my energy
[1:27:11] going all the way down there
[1:27:14] and you're gonna hard federal heart god
[1:27:16] said yes i'm going to hard pharaoh heart
[1:27:20] so i could show my power

[1:59:31] so he called and she's not been able to
[1:59:33] eat she's not been able to rest
[1:59:36] and i was just talking with him and he
[1:59:37] said would you pray for her
[1:59:40] and i just felt the lord showed me
[1:59:42] something and he said in the prayer line
[1:59:45] when brother branham would be praying
[1:59:47] somebody would come up
[1:59:49] and he would say you're not here for
[1:59:51] yourself
