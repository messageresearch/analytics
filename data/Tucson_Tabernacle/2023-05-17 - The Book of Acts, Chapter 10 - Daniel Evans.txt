[11:20] brother Lyle if you come up and open in
[11:23] prayer that would do that
[11:26] and I know they just had a trip and
[11:29] you're back here
[11:31] you told me kind of their journey and I
[11:34] said well when are you just going to
[11:35] become a pilot and fly
[11:37] and he said never so
[11:39] [Music]
[11:43] a couple of prayer requests
[11:45] sister Martha said there's a kind of a
[11:48] neighborhood cat there that they call
[11:50] her stormy and they noticed it had an
[11:53] injured leg so
[11:54] want to ask for that and my wife she
[11:58] kind of her lower back was bothering her
[12:01] some last couple of days she was doing a
[12:03] little better today so just remember her
[12:05] and if you have a need while we stand
[12:07] and say remember me
[12:09] [Music]
[12:10] believe they had time
[12:13] [Music]
[12:16] good evening and God bless you
[12:19] right I want to share just a little
[12:21] blessing that we had on the trip before
[12:23] we go to the Lord in prayer because
[12:26] for me it just showed that the Lord
[12:29] loves us very much we I I had wanted to
[12:35] find the graves of my grandparents and
[12:39] great-grandparents and it turned out
[12:40] that they're in Oakland California and
[12:43] we had to go to Berkeley to my
[12:45] grandson's graduation from the
[12:47] University of California at Berkeley
[12:49] which just happened to be this last
[12:51] weekend which is why we weren't in
[12:53] service
[12:54] well the the short version of the story
[12:58] is that after a lot of searching through
[13:00] this gigantic Cemetery I found my great
[13:04] grandparents Greece the ones that
[13:05] immigrated from Denmark born in 1859 and
[13:08] 1860. my great-grandfather it turns out
[13:13] passed away on May 14th 1923
[13:19] well we were at the cemetery on Mother's
[13:21] Day which was May 14th 2023 so it was
[13:26] exactly to the day a hundred years later
[13:29] that we were able to locate this and
[13:32] it's just a little thing and it has no
[13:34] spiritual significance but it's just the
[13:37] Lord smiling I think and saying I love
[13:40] you I care about you this is special I
[13:43] want to make this a little extra special
[13:45] for you and so he did and so we're so
[13:48] grateful so we know that the Lord cares
[13:50] about us he loves us he answers prayer
[13:53] and let's just go to him in that
[13:55] confidence knowing that these requests
[13:58] about the the neighborhood cat about
[14:00] sister Getters pain in her back the
[14:04] complete healing and restoration of our
[14:06] of our brother Larry getter so he can
[14:09] sit in that chair back there and so he
[14:10] can come up here and bless us with a
[14:12] song we're just looking forward to
[14:14] seeing the complete fulfillment of all
[14:16] of these things let's go to our lord
[14:17] lord Jesus
[14:19] we love you so much
[14:21] Lord and how can we express that Lord
[14:24] except to say that we love you and to
[14:26] express it by our love one to another
[14:28] Lord your word says invite this will all
[14:30] men know that you're my disciples Lord
[14:32] we're going to hear tonight from acts 10
[14:34] Lord about how you increase the number
[14:37] of disciples and and the miraculous and
[14:39] incredible ways that you did that and
[14:42] you're the same God you don't change you
[14:44] still do the miraculous you still do the
[14:46] incredible you still look after the
[14:48] little things if we just look we see
[14:50] your fingerprints everywhere and we're
[14:53] so grateful Lord Jesus we pray for the
[14:55] remainder of the service this evening
[14:57] Glory that you continue to be with us
[14:59] and you bless us with your presence Lord
[15:01] they should move we thank you so much

[15:07] just the spirit that even though we
[15:09] weren't here we were streaming it as we
[15:11] drove down the highway and we're just so
[15:14] grateful that that even when we're
[15:15] separated by Jesus we can still be a
[15:17] part we just commit the remainder of the
[15:20] service into your hands and we thank you
[15:22] and again we love you Lord Jesus

[20:21] brother Jordan Saint Mark chapter 9.
[20:25] verses 39 and 41.
[20:30] I must open the Bible and fell on this
[20:32] and begin to read
[20:36] the disciples actions when they saw
[20:39] somebody who wasn't in their group
[20:42] and they had told him he said we saw a
[20:46] man casting out
[20:48] in our spirits and he goes but he wasn't
[20:49] with our group
[20:51] and then but Jesus said forbid him not
[20:54] for there is no man which shall do a
[20:56] miracle in my name that can lightly
[20:58] speak evil of me
[21:00] for he that is not against us is on our
[21:03] part
[21:04] said for whosoever shall give you a cup
[21:06] of water to drink in my name because you
[21:08] belong to Christ fairly I say unto you
[21:11] he shall not lose his reward and reading
[21:15] there about Peter when he has that
[21:17] Vision he said oh I would never touch
[21:19] anything unclean
[21:21] and the Lord tells them don't call
[21:23] unclean what I have cleaned
[21:26] so I just trust you know and sometimes
[21:29] we look at somebody or someone's kind of
[21:31] Judge it that way but by the grace of
[21:34] God I'm not in that place today and I
[21:37] just appreciate
[21:39] uh leaning on the Everlasting Arms what
[21:43] a fellowship

[29:03] he does not say
[29:07] ing
[29:13] foreign
[29:16] [Music]
[29:28] Lord Jesus we're thankful that we can
[29:30] count on you that you'll still move when
[29:32] we have a need
[29:33] Lord we pray that you be with us tonight
[29:37] and Lord as I open up this book of Acts
[29:41] I want to pray that you give me wisdom
[29:46] Lord that your spirit
[29:49] you welcome here
[29:51] and father as we learn from the
[29:54] successes
[29:55] and the failures
[29:57] of these Great Men of old
[29:59] father we pray that we can take our
[30:01] lives and place them into this book and
[30:04] learn from what's been said and father
[30:07] apply it
[30:09] to every day
[30:12] most of all Lord puts you first
[30:14] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[30:17] amen
[30:18] God bless you all you can be seated
[30:22] foreign
[30:29] that scripture brother Aaron read
[30:32] I want to read it again
[30:35] um
[30:36] he was Mark is Mark 9. Mark 9 39 but
[30:40] Jordan could you put that back up
[30:45] it says this it says
[30:49] but Jesus said forbid him let's let's go
[30:51] back to 9 38.
[30:55] and John answered him saying Master we
[30:58] saw one casting out devils in thy name
[31:01] and he followed not us
[31:04] and we forbade him because he followed
[31:06] not us
[31:07] so there there's somebody casting out
[31:10] devils
[31:12] and they said hey you're not with us
[31:14] so you got to stop doing that
[31:18] but Jesus said forbid him not
[31:21] for there is no man which shall do a
[31:23] miracle in my name that can lightly
[31:27] speak evil of me
[31:29] for he that is not against us is on our
[31:32] part
[31:34] now listen to this
[31:36] for whosoever shall give you a cup of
[31:39] water to drink in my name because you
[31:42] belong to Christ verily I say unto you
[31:45] he shall not lose his reward
[31:48] the um in my Bible
[31:51] the note above that section I just read
[31:55] is called the the rebuke of sectarianism
[31:59] and that's something that that's so
[32:02] prevalent in the New Testament and it's
[32:05] so prevalent in the book of Acts
[32:07] says it's good to have you back God
[32:10] bless you it's it's it's prevalent in
[32:14] the book of Acts and it's
[32:16] it's prevalent with us even today
[32:19] and it's something that we always got to
[32:21] watch out for
[32:22] and in my lesson tonight that is going
[32:25] to be the the main the main part of it
[32:29] but first I want to give a little review
[32:31] of Acts chapter nine we had we had this
[32:34] man Saul of Tarsus and you remember what
[32:38] happened he received his conversion
[32:40] mightily he got knocked down on the
[32:43] ground and this light blinded him and
[32:46] and then he was prayed for it he was
[32:47] healed and just a a tremendous testimony
[32:52] but then we see and if I remember right
[32:55] the words were and after many days
[33:00] and we see we look at in another place
[33:03] in the Bible another place in Paul's
[33:05] writings it said that he went down to
[33:07] Arabia for three years
[33:09] and he went down
[33:11] I believe he went down to make sure that
[33:15] this experience that he had he went down
[33:19] to make sure that he was right
[33:21] because we can have an experience
[33:24] and it might not be from God
[33:28] and I talked about I mentioned the
[33:31] Mormons
[33:31] and how the Mormons will tell you to
[33:35] pray about what they say and to pray
[33:38] about this Book of Mormon and that
[33:41] you'll receive this uh I believe it's
[33:43] called a burning in the bosom but you'll
[33:46] receive this this
[33:49] um experience
[33:51] and then once you receive that
[33:52] experience all of a sudden you believe
[33:54] Joseph Smith and you believe the Book of
[33:56] Mormon
[33:58] and as I said before millions of people
[34:01] have had that experience
[34:04] so how could they have that experience
[34:08] and it be against God's word
[34:13] and it's odd because
[34:14] after I ministered on that it may have
[34:17] just been my mind I had a bad dream
[34:20] on
[34:21] and when whenever I preached it
[34:24] um
[34:25] I had a bad dream and a dream that I
[34:28] said what I just said
[34:31] and I dreamed that there was a bunch of
[34:33] Mormons in the audience
[34:36] and and as I was leaving
[34:40] they were they were saying can you
[34:42] believe what that guy said
[34:44] and the disrespect that he had and and I
[34:47] said well they don't recognize me as the
[34:49] guy that was in the Pulpit saying it so
[34:51] I went back and I I talked to him and
[34:55] and they were like well that was
[34:57] disrespectful and I said no brother I
[34:59] said it wasn't disrespectful I said it
[35:02] was the word and and you're off the word
[35:04] in doing this and and I wasn't trying to
[35:07] offend you and I felt so bad
[35:10] in my dream I was just feeling like so
[35:12] condemned like I hurt somebody but I
[35:15] told him I said
[35:16] but your doctrines are wrong and I held
[35:20] up my Bible and I patted it like I do I
[35:22] said because it's off of this book
[35:24] and then I woke up you know I'm not
[35:26] saying it was a spiritual dream or I may
[35:29] have been worried about what I what I
[35:30] said because as I've as I mentioned
[35:33] before one of my best friends growing up
[35:34] was a Mormon guy and he was just the
[35:37] salt of the earth if he asked me just
[35:39] one of the finest people you ever meet
[35:42] and I was
[35:43] thinking on that during the week and and
[35:46] a testimony
[35:49] that happened to me that I wanted to
[35:51] share with I wanted to share it last
[35:54] week but I didn't feel right about it
[35:56] but I feel good about telling it tonight
[35:58] I was in Cambodia we were doing the work
[36:01] of the Lord there
[36:03] and Cambodia is the largest Buddhist
[36:07] country in the world
[36:09] it's it's almost it's like 99 or 97
[36:12] something like that Buddhist really
[36:15] really strong in that faith
[36:18] and the Buddhism faith is uh
[36:22] it's something that the people many
[36:25] Buddhists are very very dedicated as
[36:27] with Muslims or any any real Faith but
[36:30] they really get into their faith and and
[36:33] they really get dedicated and they
[36:36] really start
[36:38] worshiping in a way and they have just
[36:40] thousands of Gods that they worship and
[36:44] they'll be different ones and we were
[36:45] when we were there we saw
[36:47] this this man that was laying in front
[36:49] of this altar of this Buddha for just
[36:52] hours and hours came back later on he
[36:55] was still laying there and he had given
[36:57] some bananas as an offering to this the
[37:00] statue it's funny how those never
[37:02] disappeared the priests come and take
[37:05] them and put them in the offering and do
[37:07] whatever they do
[37:08] but when I was there I walked into the
[37:11] hotel
[37:12] where we were a very nice hotel in
[37:15] um
[37:16] uh
[37:19] I forgot the name of the the city I
[37:22] think it's Phnom Penh is the city where
[37:24] you're at and and I walked into the
[37:26] hotel and we were checking in and just a
[37:29] beautiful place and in the center of the
[37:31] room it was probably a room about this
[37:33] size
[37:34] um in the center of the room there was a
[37:37] a Giant Buddha statue that man it may
[37:41] have reached the ceiling here it was
[37:43] giant maybe not quite that tall but just
[37:47] huge
[37:49] and I was looking at it and I was really
[37:52] admiring
[37:53] the uh the way that they had built it
[37:57] and the goal it was gold and it was just
[37:59] this beautiful
[38:01] um statue and I was looking and I was
[38:04] just trying to figure out how they built
[38:05] the thing
[38:07] and I looked up
[38:09] and this may sound strange but it
[38:12] happened
[38:13] something spoke to me
[38:16] and I got this really good feeling
[38:20] like really happy feeling and something
[38:23] spoke
[38:25] that thing
[38:26] spoke
[38:28] and it said look at me
[38:31] it said look how big I am
[38:34] I was like
[38:36] and I was looking at it
[38:38] and then it said and like I said I got
[38:40] this real happy feeling inside and it
[38:43] said it may sound strange but this is
[38:45] what it said it said don't you want to
[38:47] be my friend
[38:50] and
[38:52] then I came to myself
[38:54] I was like whoa
[38:57] that was real
[38:59] I didn't just imagine that there was a
[39:02] communication between me and something
[39:04] else
[39:06] that it it it was an experience
[39:10] that I had can you imagine if I would
[39:13] not have been anchored
[39:16] in this gospel
[39:19] or if if uh if someone is is converting
[39:22] to Mormonism if they're not anchored in
[39:25] this and they don't have that experience
[39:27] that same experience that that Saul of
[39:30] Tarsus went and spent three years
[39:32] studying imagine if I wouldn't have had
[39:35] that experience
[39:37] it was real it was a real communication
[39:40] because between something
[39:43] and me and I can't explain what it was
[39:46] so in saying that
[39:48] I wanted to bring back to your
[39:50] remembrance what Saul of Tarsus did he
[39:54] went
[39:55] away
[39:57] to pray about this experience that he
[39:59] had
[40:00] that experience whenever we have an
[40:03] experience we always need to make sure
[40:06] that this experience lines up with the
[40:09] gospel that it lines up with with the
[40:12] word of God and most of all that it
[40:14] lines up and it's all the same that it
[40:17] lines up with Christ
[40:19] check it with Christ and you'll see that
[40:24] sometimes an experience we have to be
[40:26] careful because it might lift us up
[40:30] and we might get an answer say say like
[40:33] for me if uh maybe I'm I'm praying about
[40:37] preaching the gospel or something and
[40:39] and I really really want something I'm
[40:42] gonna get what I want
[40:44] I'm going to have some experience I'm
[40:46] going to see something I'm going to have
[40:48] some sort of a of of a supernatural
[40:51] experience that it's going to give me
[40:53] what I want rather than me seeking the
[40:57] Lord and seeking what he wants
[40:59] that's what happened with Saul of Tarsus
[41:03] he went away and he sought the Lord to
[41:07] make sure that that Supernatural
[41:10] experience that he had was according to
[41:14] the word
[41:15] you see what I'm saying always be
[41:18] careful of experiences but I'm going to
[41:21] read in Acts chapter 10.
[41:23] about experiences that came from God
[41:29] don't we don't ever want to we want to
[41:31] be careful but then we don't want to put
[41:33] out something that God does
[41:35] so let's go to Acts chapter 10.
[41:43] verse 1.
[41:46] there was a certain man
[41:48] in caesarea called Cornelius
[41:52] a centurion of the band called The
[41:55] Italian band now this place caesarea
[41:59] it's a city that's named after Caesar
[42:02] Augustus
[42:03] there's a couple of them there's there's
[42:05] a at least two of these cities that that
[42:08] were named after this great man Caesar
[42:11] Augustus and basically it was the one
[42:12] who built the city and he would he named
[42:16] it after
[42:18] Caesar so that's where C that's where
[42:20] caesarea comes from the name
[42:23] and
[42:25] it says this that he was a centurion of
[42:28] the band called The Italian band now the
[42:30] Roman army had had what's called Legions
[42:33] and these Legions were between five and
[42:36] six thousand soldiers or six thousand
[42:39] men
[42:40] these Legions were compromised of what's
[42:44] called a cohort or in this case it's
[42:46] called a band
[42:48] and in those bands or those core cohorts
[42:52] were about 480 soldiers so they were
[42:55] about a little less than 500 men so in
[42:59] these bands
[43:01] these cohorts there's groups of 100
[43:06] people
[43:07] and or 100 soldiers those 100 soldiers
[43:11] are what was was led by what's called a
[43:16] centurion Century means a hundred
[43:19] so this these centurions led 100 men
[43:24] so that's how the the Roman army was
[43:27] divided now there's a few different
[43:30] centurions in the Bible and it's it's
[43:32] neat to me that that these these
[43:35] centurions many times they're spoken of
[43:37] very well
[43:39] that they many times it says they were
[43:41] devout men they were obviously a man
[43:43] with a lot of authority being over a
[43:45] hundred people there was a centurion
[43:49] um that approached Jesus
[43:53] remember he came to Jesus and it's it's
[43:55] neat to me
[43:57] that he came to Jesus on behalf of
[43:59] someone else
[44:01] he came on behalf half of one of his
[44:03] servants
[44:04] and he come he comes to Jesus in Matthew
[44:06] chapter eight he comes to the Lord and
[44:09] he says he says my servant is paralyzed
[44:13] and he's suffering terribly
[44:16] and Jesus says oh I'll go heal him
[44:20] and it's really needed he says he says
[44:23] no he says Lord I'm not worthy that you
[44:26] would come under my roof this is a Roman
[44:29] with great Authority and he sees Jesus
[44:33] for what he is and he says no Lord I'm
[44:36] not worthy that you would come under my
[44:37] roof just speak the word
[44:39] Jesus responds to him he says I haven't
[44:42] seen Faith so great not in all of Israel
[44:46] and he says let it be as according to
[44:47] your faith and that that same moment
[44:51] his servant was healed
[44:53] and then there was another
[44:55] Centurion that was at the cross when
[44:59] Jesus went
[45:01] Jesus was up on the cross and
[45:03] there was an earthquake
[45:07] Jesus died
[45:09] and this Centurion
[45:12] looks he was probably in charge of the
[45:15] whole thing I would think being over a
[45:17] hundred men it doesn't doesn't say that
[45:19] in the Bible but he was there
[45:21] and he had his his team with him
[45:25] and he he sees this earthquake and he
[45:28] sees Jesus die and he says truly
[45:32] this man was the son of God
[45:35] wow so we see that these centurions they
[45:38] have a good track record as far as the
[45:41] Bible goes
[45:44] verse number two
[45:46] talking about this Centurion named
[45:48] Cornelius a devout man and one that
[45:51] feared God with all his house which gave
[45:54] much alms to the people and prayed to
[45:57] God always
[46:00] so he was he was probably rich
[46:03] and and it says that he feared God which
[46:06] means when it says that he feared God
[46:10] they were idolaters
[46:12] they worshiped all kinds of different
[46:13] gods you know Zeus and and all the all
[46:15] the different ones depending on what
[46:17] they needed they would pray to pray to
[46:19] that one
[46:20] but this man it says he feared God so we
[46:24] can assume that he at least had a part
[46:28] of the Jewish religion
[46:30] he was probably some sort of a convert
[46:33] now he couldn't because he was unclean
[46:35] he was a gentile he couldn't participate
[46:38] in the temple worship
[46:39] and he couldn't participate in certain
[46:41] other things that the Jews participated
[46:43] with but he respected this Jewish
[46:46] religion
[46:47] and he at least partly believed
[46:51] and and another thing is that I
[46:54] appreciate with him is is he gave to the
[46:56] poor
[47:00] and uh
[47:03] some of the other translations they say
[47:05] that
[47:06] that he prayed it says that he prayed
[47:10] always some of the other translations
[47:12] says say that he prayed often some say
[47:15] that he prayed continually but one thing
[47:18] that we know from these scriptures is
[47:21] that he prayed and prayer was a regular
[47:23] thing for this man Cornelius remember
[47:26] when Jesus went or when when the Lord
[47:29] came in a vision to ananias and and Saul
[47:33] of Tarsus was laying there and and he
[47:35] was blind and do you remember what the
[47:38] Lord said to ananias
[47:40] he said go to this man Saul for he
[47:42] prayeth
[47:44] so we see here's just another example
[47:47] about how important prayer is so
[47:50] Cornelius is up there he's praying he's
[47:52] he's doing the best in verse 3 he saw in
[47:55] a vision
[47:57] evidently about the ninth hour of the
[48:00] day an angel of God coming in
[48:03] and saying unto him Cornelius
[48:07] now the ninth hour of the day
[48:10] if we start
[48:13] the day
[48:15] at six o'clock about when the sun comes
[48:18] up
[48:18] nine hours from six o'clock is three
[48:23] o'clock so when when you say it's the
[48:25] ninth hour of the day when you see it's
[48:26] the ninth hour of the day or the sixth
[48:28] hour of the day or whatever it is start
[48:29] at six and then add whatever hours it is
[48:35] I'll we'll have a test here in a few
[48:37] scriptures later
[48:40] and I'll call in the one that doesn't
[48:41] look at me
[48:44] um
[48:45] so
[48:47] so he he's he's there he's praying
[48:50] and the angel says to him Cornelius
[48:55] and when he looked on him
[48:58] he was afraid
[48:59] and said what is it Lord
[49:02] and he said unto him thy prayers and
[49:04] thine alms are come up for a memorial
[49:05] unto God
[49:07] again look how important cornelius's
[49:10] prayers are
[49:13] and as devout of a man as this Cornelius
[49:17] was as important of a man as Cornelius
[49:19] was and as as a praying man as he was
[49:22] and giving as he was you can see that he
[49:26] respected God
[49:27] he was praying and he was putting his
[49:29] faith into action by sacrificing and
[49:32] giving but yet this man Cornelius was
[49:36] not saved yet
[49:38] and I think of many of us
[49:41] and how our lives
[49:44] cornelius's life our lives may not even
[49:47] measure up to Cornelius
[49:50] but we have to they need to
[49:54] our lives and the way that we live and
[49:57] the time that we spend in prayer and the
[49:59] time that we spend in serving others as
[50:01] this man Cornelius was
[50:04] it plows the ground
[50:07] and makes it to where God can plant that
[50:11] seed
[50:12] so it's very important that we do as
[50:15] Cornelius did here that we live that
[50:17] life we do our best so that God has a
[50:21] way that that he he has this field that
[50:23] he can plant this seed into our hearts
[50:26] because if we're living a cold hard life
[50:29] how can God get in there
[50:36] you know and after that we still need
[50:42] to accept God
[50:44] you know there must be
[50:46] a conversation
[50:49] a conversion sorry that that happens in
[50:52] our lives
[50:54] that once we have done our best
[51:00] and deliver A Life That's worthy of the
[51:03] Gospel
[51:04] we still need to seek
[51:07] that touch from the Lord as Cornelius
[51:10] was
[51:12] and now
[51:15] this is the Angel speaking to Cornelius
[51:17] and now send men to Joppa
[51:20] and call for one Simon whose surname is
[51:22] Peter
[51:24] now remember
[51:26] he was a man of authority he could send
[51:28] people out
[51:31] he lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner whose
[51:34] house is by the seaside he shall tell
[51:37] thee what thou ought us to do you know
[51:39] in reading this did you ever think why
[51:41] didn't the angel just tell him about
[51:43] Jesus
[51:45] you wonder that
[51:47] why didn't why if if he's here and and
[51:50] he's praying and then his Angel comes
[51:52] down
[51:54] don't you think it had been a lot easier
[51:55] for just tell him about the Lord
[51:58] I think he would probably would have
[51:59] believed the angel
[52:01] but that's not the way God does things
[52:04] God does things he wants us to work
[52:07] together
[52:09] you know he he has he has this this
[52:12] predestinated seed as we would call call
[52:14] him called Cornelius but then he asked
[52:16] Peter and he wants Peter to to work
[52:19] together and to go over and he wants
[52:22] Peter to preach the gospel to this man
[52:25] because it's going to do something
[52:27] that's
[52:28] a little bit more than even Cornelius
[52:32] receiving his salvation
[52:34] there's God has something more in store
[52:38] and that's something more you're going
[52:41] to see the conversion of Cornelius but
[52:44] you're going to end and all these people
[52:45] that were with them but you're also
[52:47] going to see a conversion for somebody
[52:49] else
[52:51] that other person's Peter
[52:53] Peter is going to receive something
[52:55] really big here that he never even
[52:59] considered before
[53:05] verse number seven
[53:07] and the angel which spake unto Cornelius
[53:09] was Departed
[53:11] and when the angel would spake unto
[53:13] Cornelius was departed he called two of
[53:15] his household servants and a devout
[53:17] soldier of them that waited on him
[53:19] continually and when he had declared
[53:22] these things unto them he sent them to
[53:26] Joppa now another thing that's very odd
[53:29] here is caesarea is like 30 or 40 miles
[53:33] from Joppa now there's disciples they're
[53:37] going out all over the place Apostles
[53:39] why didn't he just send somebody that
[53:40] was right there
[53:42] it was something that God wanted to do
[53:45] in Peter
[53:47] he had a chosen vessel in this man Peter
[53:50] and he wanted Peter to make this journey
[53:54] one of the brothers from from Cornelius
[53:56] from from caesarea these Gentiles he
[53:59] wanted them to go to Peter he wanted
[54:00] Peter to come back and and go through
[54:04] all of this hardship to accomplish this
[54:07] goal again working together
[54:14] and on the morrow
[54:16] as they went on their journey and they
[54:18] drew nigh unto the city Peter went up on
[54:21] the housetop to pray about the sixth
[54:24] hour
[54:25] all right
[54:29] what is the sixth hour
[54:32] yes good I'm glad somebody's listening
[54:35] thank you brother Merle it's noon it's
[54:37] if we start at six we had six and and we
[54:40] we have we have noon so it's lunch time
[54:43] anyways
[54:45] and he became very hungry
[54:48] and and he would have eaten but while
[54:51] they made ready he fell into a trance
[54:53] and he saw heaven open and a certain
[54:56] vessel descending upon him as it as it
[55:00] had been a great sheet knit at the Four
[55:03] Corners and let it down to the Earth
[55:06] we're in we're all manner of four-footed
[55:09] beasts of the earth and wild beasts and
[55:11] creeping things and fowls of the air and
[55:14] there came a voice to him
[55:16] rise Peter
[55:18] kill and eat
[55:21] now remember it says in verse 10 that
[55:23] he's hungry
[55:25] but Peter said not so Lord for I have
[55:28] never eaten anything that is common
[55:32] or unclean
[55:34] now the way that this Jew was raised you
[55:38] know he would never have eaten a catfish
[55:41] because it says in the Bible it says
[55:44] earlier in the Bible and Moses's
[55:46] writings that that you don't eat a fish
[55:47] without scales and these fish live in
[55:50] the mud at the bottom so Peter would
[55:53] have never eaten that because it was an
[55:54] unclean
[55:56] fish or this this other animal that was
[55:59] supposed to you have if it has a cloven
[56:01] hoof it's supposed to chew its cud and
[56:03] then they see this pig that has a cloven
[56:05] hoof but doesn't chew its cut and it's
[56:07] all nasty this animal so you're not
[56:09] supposed to eat that either
[56:11] you're supposed to live this life
[56:14] according to the doctrines that you've
[56:17] been raised with
[56:21] now what's so odd to me
[56:25] you have
[56:27] first of all Peter says here
[56:29] not so Lord
[56:31] so
[56:33] I'm I'm gonna assume
[56:35] that this is that this is the Lord Jesus
[56:38] talking if not it was an angel that was
[56:41] sent from him but but Peter is
[56:43] recognizing this person as the Lord
[56:47] and then Peter argues with him
[56:51] how many of you would argue with the
[56:52] Lord if he's speaking to you I wouldn't
[56:55] want to
[56:57] but he says no not Lord not so Lord I've
[57:00] never in anything that's unclean or
[57:03] that's common
[57:05] like
[57:07] the Lord's going to lead you wrong
[57:09] like he's going to lead you into sin
[57:12] and here's Peter saying not I'm not
[57:15] going to do it
[57:16] Lord I've never look at me
[57:19] I go to church every every service look
[57:21] at me I I never fellowship with with
[57:24] these heathens I never do anything wrong
[57:26] Lord I live this Pious life
[57:31] this was one
[57:34] that walked with Christ
[57:37] this is the one that had the revelation
[57:41] that that knew the prophecies All
[57:44] Through the Bible from Isaiah that a
[57:46] virgin shall conceive conceive all the
[57:48] many of the Psalms that says that say
[57:50] that he's going to suffer and die the
[57:53] whole purpose of making sacrifices the
[57:55] whole Book of Leviticus is written about
[57:58] this Jesus
[57:59] and Hosea he says out of Egypt I've
[58:02] called my son Peter knows all of these
[58:04] scriptures he's preached about him and
[58:06] here is this man and he's saying he's
[58:08] saying Peter eat and he's like no
[58:13] come on Peter
[58:18] you know so many times God will send us
[58:21] a gift
[58:23] he'll send a gift into our lives
[58:27] and how many times do we refuse that
[58:29] gift because of our way of thinking
[58:32] how many times will we refuse God and
[58:35] say I don't want it because it doesn't
[58:37] line up with my religion
[58:41] how many times do we see that just
[58:44] throughout
[58:46] or how many times as this as I'm going
[58:48] to read here do we see someone some
[58:51] family or or some person come in
[58:55] and I've seen it before where it's like
[58:58] well you have to act like us do like us
[59:01] and accept this or you're not one of us
[59:05] that's what this whole chapter
[59:07] that I'm reading here is about
[59:11] Peter argues with him and you know what
[59:13] he's arguing with God about he's arguing
[59:15] about his religion
[59:17] there's a very source of religion there
[59:19] and Peter's arguing with him saying no
[59:22] no no no Lord
[59:23] I'm not going to do that
[59:27] and the voice spake unto him again the
[59:29] second time
[59:32] it says this
[59:37] what God has cleansed
[59:41] that call not thou common
[59:46] he says how dare you repeat how dare you
[59:49] Peter
[59:50] how dare you because of your beliefs in
[59:53] my word make something unclean that I
[59:57] have cleansed
[59:59] how dare you
[1:00:00] what are you thinking Peter
[1:00:04] I have done this is God speaking he
[1:00:06] could say I have done a work in their
[1:00:09] lives
[1:00:11] it's not about you or your thoughts
[1:00:15] you didn't do this work I did this work
[1:00:19] and I'll go on a little aside here a
[1:00:23] little tangent
[1:00:24] that's why we see so many so-called
[1:00:27] message churches they don't grow
[1:00:30] you know what sometimes they'll grow but
[1:00:32] you know where they're growing from is
[1:00:34] they're growing from people from this
[1:00:36] mess message church over here they don't
[1:00:39] like the pastor they don't like what he
[1:00:40] says so they're going to go over to this
[1:00:42] one
[1:00:44] and then and then well this one doesn't
[1:00:46] like what the pastor says he doesn't
[1:00:47] believe in this certain Doctrine so I'm
[1:00:49] going to go over here
[1:00:51] and the body's not growing
[1:00:54] nothing's happening there they're just
[1:00:56] it's like musical chairs they just go
[1:00:58] from church to church and then one will
[1:01:01] have better music or this it'll have
[1:01:03] better this and that church will grow a
[1:01:04] little bit more but the body isn't
[1:01:07] growing
[1:01:08] we need to be out witnessing the people
[1:01:11] that need it
[1:01:13] those are the people that we need to
[1:01:14] bring in instead of trying to hammer
[1:01:17] them on the head like Peter's doing
[1:01:19] right here hammering them on the head
[1:01:20] and say that oh you you need to fall in
[1:01:23] line and I would never Lord I would
[1:01:26] never eat something unclean and it's God
[1:01:29] himself speaking to Peter
[1:01:33] this was done three times
[1:01:36] it says
[1:01:38] this was done Thrice
[1:01:41] and the vessel was received up into
[1:01:44] heaven again
[1:01:48] seems to be Peter Peter's number you
[1:01:51] know he and I love Peter I uh
[1:01:55] Peter is one of the greatest men I've
[1:01:58] ever lived
[1:02:00] but I love the way that he made mistakes
[1:02:04] man
[1:02:06] I think that's my favorite thing about
[1:02:08] Peter
[1:02:09] is that he made mistakes and they're
[1:02:11] written in the book
[1:02:12] because I can say Lord how many mistakes
[1:02:15] that I have made
[1:02:17] but yet here's this man that's filled
[1:02:19] with the Holy Ghost and is doing all
[1:02:21] kinds of Miracles and look he's rebuked
[1:02:24] right here by God
[1:02:27] now why Peter so what so let me rewind
[1:02:31] and what happened so this Vision came
[1:02:34] down there was all these animals Peter's
[1:02:36] hungry God says Peter kill kill the
[1:02:40] animals eat it
[1:02:42] Peter says no I don't need anything
[1:02:44] that's unclean
[1:02:47] and then God says you can't make
[1:02:49] something unclean that I have cleansed
[1:02:52] so Peter's thinking about this
[1:02:55] now while Peter doubted him in himself
[1:02:58] what the what this Vision which he had
[1:03:01] seen should mean behold the men
[1:03:03] which were sent from Cornelius had made
[1:03:06] an inquiry for Simon's house and stood
[1:03:08] before the gate
[1:03:10] and he called and asked whether Simon
[1:03:13] whose surname was Peter were lodged
[1:03:14] there
[1:03:18] and he and called and asked whether
[1:03:20] Simon which surname was Peter will Lodge
[1:03:22] there
[1:03:23] while Peter thought on the vision the
[1:03:26] spirit said unto him behold three men
[1:03:29] seek thee
[1:03:30] arise therefore and get thee down and go
[1:03:34] with them doubting nothing for I have
[1:03:37] sent them
[1:03:39] then Peter went down to the men
[1:03:43] and the gods here saying don't doubt
[1:03:44] Peter
[1:03:46] then Peter went down to the men which
[1:03:48] were sent unto him for Cornelius from
[1:03:50] Cornelius and said behold I am he whom
[1:03:54] ye seek
[1:03:55] what is the cause wherewith you are come
[1:03:59] and they said Cornelius the Centurion a
[1:04:02] just man and one that feareth God and of
[1:04:05] good report among the nation of the Jews
[1:04:07] was warned from God by a Holy Angel to
[1:04:11] send for thee into his house and to hear
[1:04:14] words of Thee
[1:04:18] man beautiful
[1:04:20] the the body of Christ working together
[1:04:23] you have a needy Soul over here
[1:04:26] and you have a brother over here that
[1:04:28] has the truth and it's all coming
[1:04:31] together
[1:04:33] Peter once again
[1:04:35] in his life
[1:04:38] had to think
[1:04:40] had to forsake himself had to forsake
[1:04:42] his own thinking
[1:04:44] to serve God
[1:04:51] and I and the morrow after they entered
[1:04:53] into caesarea and Cornelius waited for
[1:04:56] them
[1:04:57] and he had called together his Kinsmen
[1:05:00] and near friends
[1:05:02] I love this testimony
[1:05:04] he said he called together his his
[1:05:07] family and his close friends
[1:05:10] and they had a house meeting
[1:05:13] I am I was out riding my bike one time
[1:05:17] in Jeffersonville
[1:05:18] and I'd I'd go out and I'd see old
[1:05:21] people sitting on their porches which
[1:05:23] they do back east and I saw this old man
[1:05:26] he was sitting on his porch his name is
[1:05:28] Henry oberley
[1:05:29] and he was sitting there and
[1:05:32] and uh
[1:05:33] I I stopped you know got off my bike and
[1:05:37] took my helmet off and I said uh
[1:05:40] I said hey uh
[1:05:42] um mind if I talked to you for a minute
[1:05:44] he says come up on the porch I can't
[1:05:46] hear you I said okay so I get up there
[1:05:49] and
[1:05:50] he says he says well sit down he says
[1:05:53] what can I do for you and I said I said
[1:05:55] you ever hear of a man
[1:05:57] named William brano
[1:06:00] and he said I sure have
[1:06:03] he baptized me right down at the end of
[1:06:05] this road
[1:06:06] and I was in Utica and the end of that
[1:06:09] road was the Ohio river which is I don't
[1:06:11] know two three hundred yards away
[1:06:14] and I said really I said I sat down and
[1:06:16] started talking with him
[1:06:18] and he said he preached his first sermon
[1:06:22] in my mom's house
[1:06:25] uh you know it's like okay sure you know
[1:06:28] whatever I actually went back and
[1:06:30] searched
[1:06:32] brother Branham said he preached his
[1:06:33] first sermon in a little home meeting
[1:06:36] everything this man lined up perfectly
[1:06:38] everything that he said lined up
[1:06:40] perfectly with what brother Branham said
[1:06:42] so I said well how did that happen he
[1:06:45] says well he said uh Billy Branham was
[1:06:48] uh he used to run the the the power
[1:06:51] lines and he checked the meters and and
[1:06:53] and uh and do the the public service
[1:06:56] stuff and he said every time he'd walk
[1:06:58] by he said my mama used to preach to him
[1:07:03] I said wow really he says oh yeah and he
[1:07:05] said my mom built this house
[1:07:07] so with this big living rooms and she
[1:07:10] always wanted to have a church service
[1:07:12] in this house but she could never find a
[1:07:15] preacher
[1:07:17] and she said and he said and she asked
[1:07:19] Billy Branham he she said well let's
[1:07:21] let's have a service and I'll bring my
[1:07:24] family just like this man Cornelius
[1:07:26] I'll bring my family
[1:07:29] so they brought their family there
[1:07:33] and brother Brandon told her he says
[1:07:34] well I've never I've never had a I never
[1:07:36] preached before
[1:07:38] this would be my first time
[1:07:40] so they go into the they go into the
[1:07:42] house and there was about brother Jeremy
[1:07:44] I think like 12 people is what he said
[1:07:47] and they had that first
[1:07:50] message
[1:07:52] and uh I think of when I read this I
[1:07:55] thought about that story and how special
[1:07:58] this must have been in this little home
[1:08:06] and as Peter was coming in Cornelius met
[1:08:08] him and fell down at his feet and
[1:08:11] worshiped him
[1:08:12] now
[1:08:15] look at the Gentile way
[1:08:17] and we are Gentiles friends
[1:08:20] look at the Gentile way he fell down and
[1:08:23] he worshiped this man of God
[1:08:27] now we we think about how the the
[1:08:30] Americans are we see on Tick Tock and we
[1:08:32] see on the different apps and the social
[1:08:35] media we have what's called influencers
[1:08:38] and they all look alike
[1:08:40] they all look the same and they want all
[1:08:43] of us to look like them
[1:08:45] and we see that that all of the the
[1:08:47] people whether it be a a professional
[1:08:50] athlete or whether it be an influencer
[1:08:52] on social media whatever it might be but
[1:08:55] we see that the public they worship
[1:08:56] these people and they want to be like
[1:08:58] them
[1:08:59] and here we see the nature of a gentile
[1:09:04] in Cornelius and he falls down
[1:09:08] and he worships this man Peter
[1:09:13] but Peter
[1:09:16] took him up saying stand up
[1:09:19] I myself also
[1:09:21] am a man you know and
[1:09:24] having my notes right here
[1:09:27] I wish more ministers would like that
[1:09:31] that sometimes people will pay the
[1:09:34] brother a compliment or or say that they
[1:09:38] really appreciated that sermon or or
[1:09:40] they'll start to lift up a man too high
[1:09:45] and then that man becomes an absolute in
[1:09:48] their life rather than them going to God
[1:09:53] and Peter here he's like listen I'm a
[1:09:55] man just like you are don't do that and
[1:09:59] we've seen it we've seen it done so much
[1:10:02] a man of God
[1:10:04] that God will use in a mighty way
[1:10:08] people will take that man and make him
[1:10:11] God
[1:10:12] and make him infallible and make him
[1:10:15] something that that never makes a
[1:10:17] mistake or makes him perfect and the
[1:10:19] only one that's ever done that is Jesus
[1:10:21] Christ
[1:10:22] and here we see this Gentile way and
[1:10:24] here we see he does that to Peter
[1:10:29] but Peter took him up saying stand up by
[1:10:32] myself also I'm a man
[1:10:34] and as he talked with him he went in and
[1:10:37] found many that were come together
[1:10:40] that's beautiful his little home meeting
[1:10:44] and he said unto them
[1:10:46] you know how that it is unlaw it is an
[1:10:49] unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew
[1:10:52] to keep company or to come unto one of
[1:10:54] another Nation but God has showed me
[1:10:58] that I should not call any man common or
[1:11:01] unclean wow Peter got the the Revelation
[1:11:06] and the interpretation of this Vision
[1:11:08] that he saw right here he knew exactly
[1:11:11] what was going on
[1:11:14] therefore came I unto you without gain
[1:11:17] saying as soon as I was sent for I asked
[1:11:21] therefore for what intent you have sent
[1:11:22] me sent from me and Cornelius said
[1:11:26] four days ago I was fasting until this
[1:11:29] hour
[1:11:30] and at the ninth hour
[1:11:32] I prayed in my house and behold the man
[1:11:35] stood Before Me In Bright clothing
[1:11:38] and said Cornelius
[1:11:39] thy prayer is heard
[1:11:42] and thine alms
[1:11:45] are had in remembrance in the sight of
[1:11:47] God
[1:11:48] so he's saying here listen those things
[1:11:51] that you have done for other people
[1:11:54] how you have given alms to the poor have
[1:11:57] you when you have supported these people
[1:11:59] and you've done you've done this
[1:12:02] he says
[1:12:05] that I saw that
[1:12:14] Cornelius said
[1:12:17] um
[1:12:18] therefore I came unto you without Peter
[1:12:21] says this therefore I came unto you
[1:12:22] without gain saying
[1:12:26] as soon as I was sent for I know I'm
[1:12:28] repeating myself I asked therefore for
[1:12:30] what intent you have sent me and
[1:12:31] Cornelius said four days ago I was
[1:12:33] fasting until this hour and at the ninth
[1:12:35] hour I prayed in my house and behold the
[1:12:37] man stood Before Me In Bright clothing
[1:12:38] and said Cornelius thy prayer is heard
[1:12:40] and thine alms or come are had in
[1:12:43] remembrance in the sight of God send
[1:12:45] therefore to Joppa
[1:12:48] we just read this happened and call
[1:12:50] hither Simon whose surname is Peter he
[1:12:53] is lodged in the house house of one
[1:12:55] Simon a Tanner by the seaside who when
[1:12:58] he cometh shall speak unto thee
[1:13:01] immediately therefore I sent to thee and
[1:13:05] thou Hast well done that thou art come
[1:13:09] now therefore
[1:13:11] are we all here present before God to
[1:13:15] hear all the things that are commanded
[1:13:16] thee of God
[1:13:18] wouldn't it be great if we all came to
[1:13:21] church like that
[1:13:24] wouldn't it if we were prepared like
[1:13:27] this man Cornelius was prepared and we
[1:13:31] could all come together to hear the word
[1:13:34] of God I guarantee you the same thing
[1:13:37] would happen as about is what's going to
[1:13:40] happen right now
[1:13:43] then Peter opened his mouth
[1:13:47] I love it when the Bible says that
[1:13:50] he just opened his mouth and the word of
[1:13:53] the Lord came forward it wasn't Peter
[1:13:56] now this is not the man that just made
[1:13:59] these mistakes speaking
[1:14:01] then Peter opened his mouth and said of
[1:14:03] a truth I perceive that God is no
[1:14:06] respecter of persons
[1:14:11] but in every nation
[1:14:13] he that feareth him and worketh
[1:14:15] righteousness is accepted with him
[1:14:18] the word which God sent unto the
[1:14:20] children of Israel preaching Peace by
[1:14:23] Jesus Christ he is Lord of all
[1:14:27] now Peter is going to bring this gospel
[1:14:31] into this modern day which is the role
[1:14:34] of every minister
[1:14:36] he's going to take these people and he's
[1:14:38] going to say okay here you are
[1:14:41] every new testament sermon if you'll
[1:14:43] read them is about Christ
[1:14:45] I don't know why we want to preach about
[1:14:47] anything else
[1:14:48] all the prophets preached about him they
[1:14:51] all pointed to him
[1:14:52] and every sermon that you'll read here
[1:14:54] is about the Lord Jesus
[1:14:58] he gives a little history Peter does and
[1:15:01] then he preaches another sermon about
[1:15:02] about Jesus
[1:15:04] this is Peter speaking that word I say
[1:15:07] you know
[1:15:08] which was published without all Judea
[1:15:10] and began From Galilee after the baptism
[1:15:13] which John preached
[1:15:15] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[1:15:18] the Holy Ghost and with power who went
[1:15:21] about doing good and healing all that
[1:15:24] were oppressed of the devil for God was
[1:15:26] with him
[1:15:28] now these people in caesarea they
[1:15:30] probably had heard these stories
[1:15:32] and we Are Witnesses of all things which
[1:15:35] he did both in the lands of the Jews and
[1:15:37] in Jerusalem whom they slew and hanged
[1:15:40] on a tree
[1:15:43] him God raised up the third day and
[1:15:46] showed him openly
[1:15:49] it's the same sermon Paul preached it's
[1:15:53] the same sermon Peter preached at the
[1:15:55] day of Pentecost it's the same thing
[1:16:01] him God raised up on the third day and
[1:16:04] showed him openly not to all the people
[1:16:07] but unto Witnesses chosen before God
[1:16:10] even to us who did eat and drink with
[1:16:13] him after he rose from the dead Peter's
[1:16:16] saying hey I was with him
[1:16:18] I am a witness of these things
[1:16:21] and he commanded us to preach unto the
[1:16:23] people and to testify that it is he
[1:16:26] which was ordained of God to be a judge
[1:16:29] of the quick and and the dead
[1:16:32] to give to him give all the prophets
[1:16:36] witness remember what I just said every
[1:16:38] sermons about Jesus
[1:16:40] to him give all the prophets witness
[1:16:42] that through his name whosoever
[1:16:45] believeth in him shall receive remission
[1:16:47] of sins
[1:16:51] while Peter yet spake these words
[1:16:53] the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard
[1:16:56] the word
[1:16:57] and they have the circumcision which
[1:16:59] believed were astonished as many as came
[1:17:03] with Peter
[1:17:05] because that on the Gentiles also was
[1:17:08] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:12] wow it's not just our people that can
[1:17:15] receive the Gospel
[1:17:17] it's not just everybody that that
[1:17:19] believes like me wow he can go out to
[1:17:22] someone else
[1:17:24] Jesus himself said there will be one
[1:17:28] Shepherd and one fold
[1:17:30] he didn't separate the Jews and the
[1:17:33] Gentiles he didn't separate the
[1:17:35] denominations he didn't separate these
[1:17:37] things he said I am the shepherd
[1:17:40] and you are the Sheep
[1:17:47] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:17:52] and magnify God
[1:17:55] then answered then answered Peter notice
[1:17:58] they did the same thing that the Jews
[1:17:59] did
[1:18:00] they acted the same way
[1:18:03] then answered Peter
[1:18:05] can any man forbid water that these
[1:18:08] should not be baptized which have
[1:18:09] received the Holy Ghost as we
[1:18:12] this is one of the times and I think it
[1:18:14] may be the only time that I know about
[1:18:16] that someone actually received the Holy
[1:18:18] Spirit
[1:18:19] before they were baptized
[1:18:23] you know we don't always want to put God
[1:18:25] in a box I've been preaching lately
[1:18:27] about about putting the new wine
[1:18:30] in new flexible wine skins
[1:18:34] and that's the same thing here see God
[1:18:37] is flexible
[1:18:38] he doesn't he doesn't say that you have
[1:18:40] to that this is always the case God says
[1:18:43] you can be
[1:18:45] Anointed with oil
[1:18:47] you can have hands laid on you
[1:18:50] or like Jesus in in the Centurion you
[1:18:54] can just speak the word
[1:18:56] he gave us many different ways even even
[1:18:58] God is flexible
[1:19:03] I want to read that again
[1:19:05] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:19:07] and magnified God then answer Peter can
[1:19:10] any man forbid water that these should
[1:19:12] not be baptized which have received the
[1:19:15] Holy Ghost
[1:19:16] as we
[1:19:19] and he commanded them to be baptized in
[1:19:22] the name of the Lord
[1:19:24] then prayed they him to tarry certain
[1:19:28] days if the musicians could come forward
[1:19:32] and we'll close
[1:19:37] and he commanded them
[1:19:38] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:19:40] then prayed they him to tarry certain
[1:19:44] days
[1:19:46] now
[1:19:48] this is this is kind of a neat way to
[1:19:51] end this chapter
[1:19:53] number one they were baptized in the
[1:19:57] name of the Lord we've seen lately we've
[1:19:58] seen a lot of people coming to be
[1:20:00] baptized there they feel something in
[1:20:02] their heart and they want to give their
[1:20:04] heart to the Lord and the Lord says
[1:20:05] here's something that you can do I
[1:20:07] command you
[1:20:08] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:20:11] Jesus for the remission of your sins
[1:20:14] so we see that right here but then
[1:20:16] there's this little subtle thing that's
[1:20:18] really neat
[1:20:19] and they asked Peter can you stay with
[1:20:21] us for a little while
[1:20:23] now put yourself in Peter's position
[1:20:26] these are
[1:20:28] unclean heathens
[1:20:31] these are not people that that a Jew
[1:20:34] would want to be found being in their
[1:20:37] home
[1:20:38] or staying with them
[1:20:41] but Peter he he's he makes he's bold
[1:20:45] remember they prayed for boldness
[1:20:47] earlier in the book of Acts Peter is
[1:20:49] bold he preached to them they gave their
[1:20:51] hearts to the Lord they received the
[1:20:53] Holy Spirit then they were baptized but
[1:20:56] later on we're going to see brotherly I
[1:20:58] don't know who's it's going to fall on
[1:20:59] you or me
[1:21:01] but later on we see
[1:21:04] that Peter was in the same position
[1:21:08] outside
[1:21:10] of Israel
[1:21:11] and we see Peter was embarrassed
[1:21:15] to be fellowshipping with these heathens
[1:21:18] and I'll tell you what Saul of Tarsus
[1:21:21] who I believe then was called Paul
[1:21:23] he ripped his head off
[1:21:26] he let him have it say how dare you
[1:21:31] Paul said I was stood him to his face
[1:21:34] for he was to be blamed I think is what
[1:21:36] he said
[1:21:37] so we see here that that it's very
[1:21:42] plainly in the book of Acts is teaching
[1:21:44] us hey don't judge remember Jesus judge
[1:21:46] not that you be not judged be careful
[1:21:49] just spread that and that tell these
[1:21:51] people about the Lord Jesus
[1:21:54] every sermon as I said is about Christ
[1:21:58] so tell them about Christ don't cut them
[1:22:01] out don't force them to do anything we
[1:22:03] have
[1:22:04] later on again we'll see a man named
[1:22:07] Titus and we'll see a man named Timothy
[1:22:10] and we'll see that this this Covenant of
[1:22:13] circumcision was very important to the
[1:22:16] Jews
[1:22:17] and we see that here comes Timothy and
[1:22:20] because he's going to preach the gospel
[1:22:22] to the Jews he gets circumcised and this
[1:22:26] man I believe it was Titus says no I'm
[1:22:28] not doing it
[1:22:29] and Paul did not rebuke him for it Paul
[1:22:32] said that was his choice
[1:22:34] it did not change one bit
[1:22:38] titus's walk with the Lord
[1:22:41] and
[1:22:42] the same friends the same with us
[1:22:45] we hold God's word
[1:22:48] as precious to us
[1:22:52] but we need to be careful
[1:22:55] that
[1:22:57] our testimony
[1:22:59] and our Doctrine
[1:23:01] it doesn't just become like Peter's
[1:23:04] where
[1:23:05] that even though he had the Holy Spirit
[1:23:07] even though he was saved it doesn't it's
[1:23:09] not like Peter said that says well you
[1:23:12] have to do it this way
[1:23:13] and I know I preached that a lot and I'm
[1:23:15] going to keep preaching it because I
[1:23:17] believe that it's been a hindrance
[1:23:19] to the people
[1:23:21] over over the past decades I believe
[1:23:23] it's really hindered good people
[1:23:27] putting God in a box and saying that you
[1:23:30] have God you have to do it this way
[1:23:33] like Peter said not so Lord
[1:23:38] talking to God himself
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:41] not so Lord no no no no no no no
[1:23:44] we have no right we have no right to do
[1:23:48] it what we do is we say Jesus Christ
[1:23:52] saved me from my sins
[1:23:54] Jesus Christ is the reason I'm here
[1:23:57] and I serve him
[1:23:59] would you like
[1:24:01] to serve him
[1:24:02] and if you would
[1:24:04] here's what his word says that's the way
[1:24:07] that we should be amen
[1:24:10] do you like the book of Acts I love it
[1:24:13] it's it's so exciting to me it's it's
[1:24:15] just
[1:24:17] it's so applicable
[1:24:19] to today
[1:24:20] you know you see it's like Peter
[1:24:23] that's God but how many times do we do
[1:24:26] it
[1:24:27] say you have to you have to come my way
[1:24:29] no no no no no no
[1:24:31] no
[1:24:33] and as I said I believe it's been the
[1:24:34] biggest hindrance
[1:24:37] to so many people over the past
[1:24:41] 60 50 60 70 years it's just hindered
[1:24:45] it's hindered us trying to put God in a
[1:24:48] box just just as we see here in this
[1:24:51] book of Acts and and we're gonna it
[1:24:52] didn't stop on this one there's gonna be
[1:24:54] more and more examples of it happening
[1:24:57] I appreciate Cornelius his love for the
[1:25:00] Lord I appreciate his dedication
[1:25:03] and
[1:25:08] and
[1:25:09] God honored it he plowed that field
[1:25:13] the angel came down
[1:25:16] said Cornelius
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:20] this Lord
[1:25:22] I said go sin man go get this man Peter
[1:25:24] way over there there may have been a
[1:25:26] Phillip or a or a uh Nathaniel or or
[1:25:31] even a genre James over here but he sent
[1:25:35] way over to Joppa
[1:25:38] to get this man Peter because Peter
[1:25:41] also needed a conversion
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:46] let's stand God bless you all I hope you
[1:25:48] do love this book of Acts I hope you're
[1:25:51] I hope you're in it
