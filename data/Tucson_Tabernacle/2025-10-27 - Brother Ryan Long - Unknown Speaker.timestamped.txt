[16:27] Brother Ryan's going to get ready to
[16:28] come and minister right now. Brother
[16:30] Daniel sent me this. He wanted me to
[16:32] read it. He said between 50 and 60
[16:36] people came to the to the little service
[16:38] they had in uh uh inner city Louisville.
[16:42] Um 50 and 60 people came. One young man
[16:46] came to the altar and gave his heart to
[16:48] the Lord. He says, "I think this was a
[16:50] special service because it opened up
[16:52] some doors that none of us ever
[16:54] expected." He said, "He'll give a full
[16:56] report to the church when he gets back."
[16:58] He said, "Greet them, tell them I love
[16:59] them, and I'm praying for them, and I
[17:01] look forward to getting home and giving
[17:03] a trip report." So,
[17:07] it's good that
[17:12] that make you excited to hear someone
[17:14] came and gave their heart to the Lord.
[17:16] Oh, that just makes me feel so good.
[17:18] Praise God.
[17:24] Amen. As brother Ryan comes, we're going
[17:27] to sing When He reached down his hand
[17:29] for me.
[17:31] I was lost and undone without God or his
[17:33] son. When he reached down his hand for
[17:36] me. Amen.
[17:38] Once my soul
[17:41] was astray
[17:43] from the heavenly
[17:47] way
[17:48] and was wretched
[17:51] and vile
[17:53] as could be.
[17:58] God, my Savior
[18:01] above
[18:03] gave me peace,
[18:05] joy, and love
[18:08] when he reached
[18:10] down his hand
[18:13] for me. When he reached
[18:17] When he reached
[18:20] down his hand
[18:22] for me.
[18:27] Oh, and he reached
[18:30] down his hand
[18:32] for me.
[18:36] Oh, I was lost
[18:39] and undone
[18:42] without God
[18:44] or his son
[18:46] when he reached
[18:49] down his hand
[18:51] for me. Verse three.
[18:56] How my heart
[18:58] doth rejoice
[19:01] since I've made
[19:03] him my choice.
[19:06] From the tempest
[19:08] to him.
[19:10] Now I flee.
[19:15] Now I lean
[19:18] on his arm and I'm secure.
[19:22] from all harm
[19:25] since he reached
[19:27] down his hand
[19:30] for me.
[19:31] [Music]
[19:34] When he reached
[19:37] down his hand
[19:39] for me.
[19:41] [Music]
[19:44] when he reached
[19:46] out his hand
[19:49] for me.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Well, I was lost
[19:56] and undone
[19:58] without God
[20:01] or his son
[20:03] when he reached
[20:06] down his hand
[20:08] for me.
[20:13] God bless you, brother Ryan.
[20:28] [Music]
[20:33] &gt;&gt; If there was ever a song that could be
[20:34] my anthem this morning, it would be came
[20:37] on my heart this morning.
[20:39] Um, just sing it with me if you could.
[20:41] He knew
[20:44] me
[20:48] yet he loved
[20:51] me.
[20:54] He whose glory
[20:57] he whose glory
[21:00] makes
[21:02] the heaven shine.
[21:08] I'm so unworthy
[21:11] [Music]
[21:16] of such mercy.
[21:19] [Music]
[21:23] Yet when he
[21:26] was on the cross,
[21:31] I was on his mind. And let's sing this
[21:36] first verse.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not on a dele.
[21:45] I'm nothing
[21:47] on my own.
[21:51] I've made mistakes.
[21:55] I often slip.
[21:58] Just come in flesh and bone.
[22:05] But I'll prove someday
[22:09] just why I say
[22:13] I'm of a special
[22:17] kind.
[22:19] For when he
[22:21] was on the cross,
[22:27] &gt;&gt; I was on his mind. That second verse,
[22:33] that look of love.
[22:35] The look of love
[22:37] was on his face. The thorns were on his
[22:45] head.
[22:48] The blood was on his scarlet
[22:53] robe,
[22:55] stained a crimson
[22:58] red.
[23:01] Though his eyes were on the crowd that
[23:07] day, he looked he looked ahead
[23:12] inside.
[23:14] [Music]
[23:15] And when he was on the cross,
[23:20] &gt;&gt; you got to claim this this morning,
[23:23] you were on his mind. Just sing it to
[23:28] him this morning.
[23:30] For he knew
[23:33] me,
[23:37] &gt;&gt; yet he loved
[23:40] me.
[23:46] He whose glory
[23:49] remains
[23:51] the heaven shines.
[23:54] [Music]
[23:57] I'm so unworthy
[24:00] [Music]
[24:05] of such worthy.
[24:08] [Music]
[24:12] Yet when he was on the cross,
[24:20] I was on
[24:24] his mind.
[24:26] Yet when he was on the cross,
[24:35] you and I
[24:37] were on
[24:39] his mind.
[24:42] Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[24:46] Our heavenly father, Lord, and
[24:49] and Lord, maybe our small way, Lord, and
[24:52] maybe our unworthy way, we just want to
[24:55] sing those words to you this morning,
[24:56] Lord, because I believe that we we know
[24:59] what we're singing about in this song,
[25:00] Lord. That we know, Father, without
[25:02] without you, Father, we don't have,
[25:04] Lord, even a chance, Father.
[25:07] Let Lord, despite us and despite
[25:09] ourselves and all of our sinful ways,
[25:12] Lord, you you reach down, Lord, as the
[25:15] song said, Lord, and and reach down and
[25:18] grab me, Lord, when I was unreachable,
[25:19] Lord.
[25:22] And when I was unsavable, Lord, you
[25:24] saved me.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:29] [Music]
[25:33] &gt;&gt; And when I was without hope, Lord,
[25:38] Maybe somebody standing here in this
[25:41] building today,
[25:44] Lord, feels like they're without hope
[25:46] this morning.
[25:50] Maybe they have something whispering in
[25:53] their mind. Lord,
[25:56] God's God can't do that for you.
[26:00] You've sinned away your day. You've
[26:01] crossed the line.
[26:04] But Lord, we serve
[26:07] we serve a God that has no limits.
[26:10] We serve a God, Lord. It's you, Father,
[26:13] that can cross over the lines that we
[26:15] draw, Father. And you can save us, Lord.
[26:18] And when I have no hope, Lord, you
[26:20] provide a hope, Father.
[26:23] It's not a fairy tale, as the world
[26:24] would say. It's not a madeup emotion,
[26:27] Lord. It's it's a life. It's a life that
[26:30] is not my own, Lord, but that you've
[26:32] restored unto me, Father.
[26:35] And Lord, just by a lifting of a hand,
[26:36] Father, I pray if there's just a heart
[26:39] out there, Lord, that that needs to have
[26:42] confidence in something other than our
[26:43] own ability this morning, Lord, that
[26:45] they would just raise their hand to you.
[26:47] And Lord, just through a simple act,
[26:49] Lord, of just raising our hand and
[26:51] defying gravity, Lord, that you would
[26:53] let them know in their heart, Father,
[26:54] that you see their hand, Lord. That you
[26:56] see that their life, Lord, that you see
[26:58] that they're they mean something to you,
[27:01] Lord. that there's a person that Lord
[27:03] that you love to come and save, Lord,
[27:06] that you love to come and restore. Lord,
[27:08] that you you want to come and deliver,
[27:10] Lord. And you just help us, Father, to
[27:11] get out of the way, Lord, to to let you
[27:13] have your way in our lives, Lord.
[27:16] Help us to surrender to you this
[27:18] morning, Lord. And not just this
[27:19] morning, Lord, but as we go from this
[27:21] place, Father.
[27:23] Lord, we love you so much. We there's a
[27:25] many other places we could be this
[27:26] morning, Lord, but we Lord, the people
[27:29] have come and chosen to be here under
[27:31] your presence, Lord, under your
[27:32] anointing, Father. And we do that
[27:34] because we trust in you, Lord, that
[27:36] you'll come and speak to us this
[27:37] morning, Lord.
[27:39] And I pray you would just do that now
[27:41] just for the next few minutes, Lord, as
[27:43] long as you would like. That we just
[27:45] surrender this time to you, Lord. We
[27:46] surrender our hearts, our ears to you,
[27:48] Lord, that you would just come and have
[27:49] your way in our service this morning.
[27:51] Lord, we ask all these things in Jesus
[27:54] name. Amen.
[27:56] Amen. You forgive me this morning.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; When you're ready, you can just call us
[27:59] back up.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. Thank you to the
[28:01] musicians. So good to be with you here
[28:03] this morning. How many is happy to be in
[28:05] the house of the Lord this morning?
[28:08] Amen.
[28:11] There's a lot of other places we could
[28:12] be, but I can't think of a better one
[28:14] this morning than to be the house of the
[28:16] Lord. I sure would like to be in your
[28:18] seat this morning, but um you know,
[28:21] somebody's I guess got to stand up here
[28:23] and uh you know, somebody sent me
[28:25] something recently. I just agreed with
[28:27] it so much. He said uh you know, there's
[28:29] a difference um there's a difference
[28:31] between loving to preach and loving the
[28:34] people that you preach to. And if you
[28:36] know anything about me, you would know I
[28:38] don't love to preach. But one one reason
[28:41] why I always feel a privilege to accept
[28:43] brother Dan's invitation is I sure love
[28:45] the people that I come and preach to
[28:47] down here in Tucson. And so it makes it
[28:49] an easy decision. Although I wouldn't
[28:51] want to be up here. Uh I love you all so
[28:53] much. And so I hope that it comes across
[28:56] from our hearts how we how you feel how
[28:58] we feel about you. And just I praise
[29:00] that I pray that the Lord does something
[29:02] for you this morning. I believe he's
[29:03] already inhabited our praises this
[29:05] morning. How many feels his presence
[29:07] with us this morning? Amen.
[29:12] Amen. It's just good to be here this
[29:14] morning and uh just looking around. I
[29:16] just want to get a little relaxed and
[29:18] comfortable if that's okay. And if you
[29:20] have just a moment in your heart to say
[29:22] a quick prayer, just pray that the Lord
[29:24] gives me a little bit of grace and mercy
[29:27] this morning. Gives me something to say.
[29:28] Amen. We just want to get out of the way
[29:30] as as not only the speaker, but as the
[29:32] hearers, we want to just get out of the
[29:33] way this morning, right? And just let
[29:35] him speak directly to our hearts. not
[29:37] let our minds get in the way, the
[29:39] thoughts of the day get in the way.
[29:41] Let's just give him a little bit of
[29:42] moment of our time. Amen. And see what
[29:44] he can do with just a little bit. All he
[29:45] needs, you know, all he needed from
[29:47] David was just with just a little stone.
[29:49] He did the rest. Amen.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; That's all he needs. He just needed a
[29:52] little bit of time from us. Just a
[29:53] little bit of surrender, just a little
[29:55] bit of loaves and fishes. He'll feed.
[29:56] He'll do the rest of the work. Amen.
[29:58] While you're standing, let's turn into
[30:00] our Bibles into uh Luke. We'll just read
[30:03] one verse here and then I'll let you be
[30:05] seated and then we'll read another
[30:07] couple verses over in Mark Luke chapter
[30:09] 7. Amen. Good to be in the in the in the
[30:12] house of the Lord this morning. We pray
[30:14] that the Lord it sounds like the Lord is
[30:16] being good to the services there where
[30:19] brother Dan is at. And uh we just thank
[30:21] the Lord that he is uh he doesn't need
[30:22] to just be stuck in one place this
[30:24] morning. He can be everywhere and he can
[30:26] be delivering people all over the world.
[30:28] We just pray we just praise him for
[30:29] that. Luke 7 verse 23.
[30:32] Uh just a quick verse 7:23. It says,
[30:34] "Blessed is he
[30:37] whosoever shall not be offended in me."
[30:40] Amen. You may be seated. And I want to
[30:42] turn over to Luke chapter 8.
[30:47] As you're taking your seats, Luke
[30:48] chapter 8.
[30:51] Let's read a couple scriptures here. In
[30:53] Luke, it say I'm sorry, in Mark. I I
[30:55] apologize. Mark chapter 8. Amen. You
[30:58] just forgive me. a little I'm always get
[30:59] a little nervous when I get up behind
[31:01] the pulpit, but we just want to really
[31:03] rely on the Lord this morning. How
[31:04] many's happy to be in the house of the
[31:06] Lord?
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:10] How many's gotten something out of a
[31:11] service already this morning? How many's
[31:13] felt the touch of the Lord? Amen.
[31:16] Well, then the work is done. We could
[31:18] just relax and let the Lord give us a
[31:19] little bit of bonus this morning. Amen.
[31:21] If we've already been in touch, brother
[31:22] Manny, it's good to see you on that
[31:24] front row with your wife. I think I was
[31:26] here last time and you weren't here. And
[31:27] I tell you, I missed seeing you on that
[31:29] front row. So, I just wanted to point
[31:31] out that I noticed when you're not here.
[31:34] So,
[31:36] I'm sure it was for good reason, but it
[31:38] just kind of gives me comfort to to look
[31:40] around and see some familiar faces.
[31:41] Amen. I don't have brother Daniel Jr. to
[31:43] pick on over in the front row. He's
[31:46] probably relieved. So, Markapter 8:34,
[31:49] uh Jesus here talking to his disciples.
[31:52] He says, "And when he had called the
[31:53] people unto him with his disciples also,
[31:55] he said unto them, whosoever will come
[31:57] after me, let him deny himself." I just
[32:00] want you to remember that phrase there,
[32:01] "Let him deny himself and take up his
[32:06] cross and follow me. For whosoever will
[32:08] save his life," can we just make I
[32:10] didn't plan on duties. Can we just make
[32:12] this scripture a little bit personal
[32:13] this morning?
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Can I just make it personal to you? I
[32:16] don't mean to I don't want to change the
[32:17] word of God, but I want this to really
[32:18] sink down and know that Jesus is not
[32:21] just talking to his disciples 2,000
[32:23] years ago, but he's directly talking to
[32:25] all of us this morning. Amen. So, I want
[32:27] to say this. So, if if uh you could put
[32:30] your name there, I'll just put if Tucson
[32:32] Tabernacle will save their life, they
[32:35] will lose it.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that's changing the
[32:39] word. I believe that's make taking the
[32:40] word from 2,000 years ago and making it
[32:42] apply today.
[32:45] But if Tucson Tabernacle and those in it
[32:47] shall lose their life for my sake and
[32:49] the gospel's sake, the same shall save
[32:52] it. For what shall it profit us here in
[32:55] Tucson Tabernacle
[32:58] if we shall gain the whole world but
[33:00] lose our soul?
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Or what should we gain here this morning
[33:07] if we give in exchange for our soul?
[33:09] What what would you give in exchange for
[33:11] your soul?
[33:12] Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[33:15] me of my words, in this adulterous and
[33:18] sinful generation, of him also shall the
[33:21] Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in
[33:25] the glory of his father with the holy
[33:27] angels. You know, I didn't even plan on
[33:28] saying this, but this phrase just jumped
[33:30] out at me in this this adulterous and
[33:33] sinful generation. Can we just talk
[33:34] about that for just a minute this
[33:36] morning? This phrase is used a lot in
[33:38] the Bible about this being a sinful and
[33:40] adulterous generation. And we can
[33:41] certainly look at this and look at out
[33:43] the world and go, "Yeah, I I know what
[33:45] the Bible's talking about. What a sinful
[33:47] world that we live in. What a sinful and
[33:48] adulterous generation. But but the
[33:50] Bible, if I really want to have the
[33:52] effect that the Bible should have on me,
[33:54] I need to take the Bible and I need to
[33:56] apply it to myself." Amen. So I look at
[33:59] this and say, "Wait a minute. What about
[34:00] what about me? What about Tucson
[34:02] Tabernacle this morning? What about me,
[34:04] the man in the mirror? When he's talking
[34:05] about a sinful and adulterous
[34:08] generation, what is he speaking about
[34:09] here in the Bible?" And you'll see it
[34:10] all throughout the Bible. And I think
[34:12] what he's referring to is this, and you
[34:14] could you could take this and and go
[34:15] through the Bible and find it. You know,
[34:17] there was a man named Elijah. He came
[34:19] unto a widow woman. Remember the story?
[34:21] Anybody know the story? He came unto a
[34:23] widow woman during a during a time of
[34:25] famine. And he and he asked for the
[34:28] widow woman of everything that she had
[34:30] left. He asked for all the oil and he
[34:32] asked for all the meal that she had for
[34:33] a cake. And I want you to notice that
[34:35] that Elijah was sent unto not a divorced
[34:39] woman.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; He was sent unto a widow woman.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; So he was sent unto a woman. Now let's
[34:46] just put our spiritual caps on. Okay, we
[34:48] just put our spiritual caps on. This is
[34:49] real simple. He was sent unto a woman
[34:51] whose husband was no longer living. Now
[34:54] this is this is something I could say
[34:56] applies to all of us here. All of us
[34:58] from the day we were born were born with
[35:00] a husband.
[35:04] All of us were born from the very first
[35:06] day to a husband. You know all know who
[35:07] that husband was. It's Satan. It's the
[35:10] world. It's a seed that we didn't have a
[35:12] choice. You didn't choose to be married
[35:14] to this person. You were born under a
[35:16] nature. Amen. That that that we don't
[35:18] want that nature. You know, if you if
[35:20] you I I believe there's an example. If
[35:22] you lived out in an island somewhere and
[35:24] you never had contact with any of the
[35:26] evil of the world, you just lived by
[35:28] yourself, you know, you'd still be an
[35:30] evil and no good person. Do you know
[35:32] that?
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Right? Because when you were born, you
[35:35] were born married to a p to to to a
[35:37] seed. You were married to somebody that
[35:39] I tell you you don't want to be married
[35:41] to.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've never decided to
[35:44] sin. I never decided." No, no, you
[35:45] didn't because you were born that way.
[35:47] See, we're already married to somebody.
[35:49] And I think maybe sometimes the problem
[35:50] definitely with myself, if I could just
[35:52] preach to myself this morning, is the
[35:54] reason why this Bible is addressing a
[35:56] wicked, an adulterous, and a sinful
[35:58] generation is a lot of times many people
[36:00] have come to the Lord. Many people have
[36:03] come to the Lord, but they but their
[36:05] husband is still alive.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; And they've come to the Lord to be
[36:10] married to the Lord, to be married to
[36:12] Christ Jesus, while they still have
[36:14] another husband alive.
[36:17] See, the old husband sometimes is only
[36:19] divorced. We've separated ourselves from
[36:22] the sin and the things we used to think,
[36:24] right? Oh, I'm not going to do those
[36:26] evil things anymore. I'm not going to
[36:28] I'm not going to do those habits that I
[36:30] used to have. Right? But sometimes, can
[36:32] I just can I just speak in modern terms?
[36:34] Is it all right if I just be open with
[36:35] Sometimes the ex comes over to visit
[36:38] sometimes,
[36:40] &gt;&gt; right? The ex the exspouse comes over to
[36:43] visit.
[36:44] Just put on your spiritual thinking
[36:46] caps. I'm not talking about natural
[36:47] marriage divorce. I'm talking about
[36:48] sometimes the the the old man, the the
[36:51] the husband has not been killed. The hos
[36:55] the husband has not been died. And if
[36:57] you're struggling, if you're struggling
[36:59] this morning to walk, if you're
[37:00] struggling to find a path in Christ
[37:02] Jesus, I wonder if you check back and
[37:05] see if the old husband has really died.
[37:09] See, because if you come into a union
[37:11] with Christ and you try to have a
[37:13] relationship with him
[37:15] &gt;&gt; and the old husband hasn't died, you're
[37:17] actually committing adultery
[37:20] &gt;&gt; with the truth.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Now, that sounds like what do you mean
[37:25] talking about committing adultery? No.
[37:26] No. God's not committing adultery. We're
[37:28] committing adultery.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; See, the old husband cannot be alive and
[37:33] you have a relationship with a new one.
[37:36] Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; And if there's a problem, if there's
[37:38] just a little, you know, sometimes
[37:39] you're like, I'm going along good. I'm
[37:41] going along for three months or How many
[37:43] is a How many's a new Christian in here?
[37:45] How many is a Christian that maybe has
[37:46] been a Christian for a year or two years
[37:48] or five years? I call that new
[37:49] Christian, but that's not There's
[37:50] There's several hands. You say, "I'm I'm
[37:53] going along just fine." And then all of
[37:54] a sudden, brother, I I I trip up.
[37:57] I make a mistake. And then I think to
[38:00] myself, well, why does it even matter? I
[38:01] might as well just go back to doing what
[38:02] I was doing, right? How many How many
[38:04] gets that whispered in their ear? Well,
[38:06] I was doing so well, but then the
[38:07] willpower ran out. Or I I you know, I I
[38:09] I thought I was over that thing. I think
[38:12] I think we need to take a look at that
[38:13] old husband and see if maybe it's just
[38:15] been divorced.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Kind of waiting to come back in whenever
[38:20] there's a chance. Waiting for an opening
[38:21] to come and whisper. I didn't really
[38:23] plan on going that route, but I just see
[38:24] this phrase, an adulterous generation.
[38:27] And sure, it'd be a real easy target
[38:29] just to apply it to the world, but the
[38:31] world's not trying to get married to
[38:33] Jesus Christ.
[38:34] They're not living in adultery. They're
[38:36] living with their first husband. So, if
[38:38] it's talking about an adulterous
[38:39] generation, it's talking about somebody
[38:41] who's trying to be married to the world
[38:43] and also trying to be married to Christ.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; And I found many times when I examine my
[38:48] own life, it's if it's no good for me,
[38:50] it's no good for you out there. If I
[38:52] examine my own life, have I really put
[38:54] that old husband in the grave?
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, that was I guess they would
[39:00] say that's free. That that wasn't part
[39:02] of it. That was a little bit free. But I
[39:03] but the scripture was so good. It says,
[39:05] "Whoever come after me, let him deny
[39:08] himself." And then this this first
[39:09] scripture, uh, "Blessed is he who is not
[39:12] offended in me." If I just want to
[39:14] concentrate on that for a few minutes
[39:15] this morning. I pray we won't take too
[39:18] long this morning. Um, I don't I don't
[39:21] usually go down the path of sometimes
[39:22] definitions, but I think it's really
[39:23] important to know what sometimes what a
[39:25] word means. To be offended means to feel
[39:27] hurt or angry or upset because something
[39:30] said or done that is perceived as
[39:33] disrespectful, insulting or wrong.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever felt offended?
[39:45] &gt;&gt; All right, there's there's a few in here
[39:47] are not struggling with that, but I I
[39:49] can raise my hand.
[39:52] It's a feeling of indignation or
[39:54] displeasure that arises when one's
[39:56] beliefs, values, dignity,
[40:00] or sense of self are challenged,
[40:06] you know, and can I I'll just take a
[40:08] real easy this is just kind of
[40:09] cherrypicking a real easy example. We
[40:11] live in a world of offense, right?
[40:16] If you're not, if you don't see the
[40:18] offense that's going on in the world,
[40:19] you that means you don't own the
[40:21] internet. You don't ever walk outside.
[40:25] You don't own a phone or a newspaper.
[40:28] Because as soon as you look at what's
[40:30] happening in the world, you see that we
[40:31] just live in a world that's just full of
[40:34] people being offended by something. You
[40:37] know, you could be offended by u
[40:39] everywhere we see people are offended.
[40:40] Offended by something that said, right?
[40:44] offended by something that somebody
[40:46] stands for. You know what I'm talking
[40:48] about. Offended by something somebody
[40:49] doesn't stand for. Offended by what the
[40:52] right and the left say. Offended by what
[40:55] Biden says, about what Trump says.
[40:57] Right? Offended by a flag. Offended that
[41:00] you don't carry a flag. Amen. Who am I?
[41:01] Who am I preached to this morning?
[41:04] Right? It just hits home. Offended by a
[41:05] sign in a front yard or no sign in a
[41:08] front yard. Offended by a bumper
[41:09] sticker. Right? Everybody's offended by
[41:12] every single thing and it just right it
[41:14] just seems to keep getting worse. Now
[41:16] that's that's okay. That's that's a
[41:18] problem. But that's a problem for
[41:20] somebody who's still married to the
[41:22] world.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; See, that's a problem for somebody whose
[41:25] husband hasn't died yet and been put
[41:27] away
[41:28] &gt;&gt; into the grave. And and you know,
[41:30] sometimes if I'm not careful, I find
[41:32] myself being offended by these things.
[41:36] Sometimes I'm not even involved in it
[41:37] and I get offended for somebody else for
[41:39] them. Right? I see a news story I'm
[41:42] like, "Wow, I'm offended. I wasn't even
[41:43] I wasn't even the one insulted, right?"
[41:45] Because we have a personal stake in
[41:46] these things is what we believe. But you
[41:49] know, those are the affairs of the
[41:50] world. You know, politics politics is
[41:53] not going to save anything. Being on the
[41:55] right side or the wrong side, it's not
[41:57] going to save anything. I I I just think
[41:58] I think personally we spend a little bit
[42:00] too much time worried about those
[42:02] things. You know, God's not worried
[42:03] about those things. And if God's not
[42:06] worried about those things, why am I
[42:07] worried about those things?
[42:09] &gt;&gt; If God's not if he's not in those
[42:11] affairs, why am I getting in those
[42:13] affairs?
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Why should I care what somebody says
[42:16] about God when I know it's not true?
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Am I going to go change their mind? I
[42:21] don't know. That's just how I feel. But
[42:23] what happens now? Now that's Now that's
[42:24] when you you happen to be born of the
[42:26] world, which we're all born of the world
[42:28] at the beginning, right? If you find
[42:29] yourself being offended by those things,
[42:31] let's let's check our birth a little
[42:32] bit. But sometimes there's another
[42:34] problem that happens. And sometimes that
[42:35] problem is when you're born of a church.
[42:39] You just go into that a little bit this
[42:40] morning. The likelihood that you're
[42:42] going to be offended by something that
[42:43] goes on in the church is 100% certain if
[42:46] you're born of the church.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. Born of
[42:51] the church.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; You know, when you when you when you
[42:55] come into a church, I believe in church.
[42:56] I mean, we're stand sitting in one this
[42:58] morning. I believe in church, but you
[42:59] know, we're not supposed to be married
[43:01] to the church.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; See, if if you manage to kill the old
[43:06] husband and he died and he's buried, you
[43:08] could also get married to the next one
[43:10] that's the wrong one.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; See, if you get married to the church,
[43:14] you're going to find yourself in a new
[43:15] set of problems that look a lot like the
[43:18] old set of problems.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Offended. You know, uh can I just go
[43:22] through a few of these? Are we okay this
[43:24] morning? You know, sometimes we get
[43:25] offended when the songs are a little bit
[43:27] too fast.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; And if you've traveled around in
[43:30] churches, you'll know that they get
[43:32] offended. Some people, you know, that
[43:33] song's a little bit too fast. Or, you
[43:35] know what, we those a little bit too
[43:36] slow. We like our worship a little bit
[43:38] more lively. Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; If you haven't traveled around, maybe
[43:41] you don't run into this, but I think
[43:43] it's I think it's a problem. You know,
[43:44] those How about this one? Uh, Brother
[43:46] Josiah, you probably never heard this
[43:47] one before. You know, those songs are
[43:48] just a little bit too modern.
[43:54] I don't I'm not going to sing along to
[43:55] that song
[43:57] because it's not an oldfashioned song.
[44:00] And then you get, okay, I'll just play
[44:02] both sides. And then you get people
[44:03] like, those songs are too oldfashioned.
[44:05] I don't know the words. I don't know the
[44:07] melodies. I'm not going to sing along.
[44:09] These other songs are what speak to me.
[44:14] I'll just leave I'll just leave that one
[44:15] alone because I
[44:18] I'm a musician as well, so it's not like
[44:20] I don't hear these things. So, you know,
[44:22] offended because the congregation was
[44:23] too loud. You you you can you believe
[44:25] that?
[44:27] &gt;&gt; You know, there's there's uh there's
[44:28] pastors and ministers that are offended
[44:30] if the congregation gets too loud. And
[44:32] then there's some that are offended when
[44:34] they're too quiet. Oh, I need to hear
[44:36] some more amens.
[44:38] You know, if you got to pull amens out
[44:40] of people, you know, maybe check and see
[44:42] what's being said. You know,
[44:45] I
[44:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know. That's just the way I
[44:46] feel. You know, maybe we're offended
[44:48] when it's too quiet or we get offended
[44:50] when it's too loud. I'm just going to
[44:51] preach to human beings because I think,
[44:53] you know, I run into this all the time,
[44:54] but you know, um, you know, I don't know
[44:57] about this one. You're offended
[44:58] sometimes when you know sin is going on
[45:00] in the church and you're offended that
[45:02] the preacher doesn't get on the sin hard
[45:04] enough.
[45:06] Well, I know things are going on in the
[45:07] church and the preacher should preach
[45:08] against it. And we don't have to say
[45:10] amen to this part, but you know, the
[45:11] preacher preaches against I wish he was
[45:13] just a little bit more corrective on the
[45:15] sin, right?
[45:16] And then the other side maybe get
[45:18] offended when the preacher's just a
[45:19] little bit too hard on the correction
[45:20] side. Well, you know, I'm just a human
[45:22] being. I I I I don't know if any of this
[45:24] makes sense to you, but it does to me
[45:26] because I could just put a mirror right
[45:27] here and realize I I've been offended by
[45:30] all these things.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; I found myself in offense with this.
[45:33] Offended when, you know, how about when
[45:34] the preacher goes a little bit too long,
[45:38] &gt;&gt; right? Well, you know, you know, you
[45:40] know, it says, you know, over here in
[45:42] this message that you should be only
[45:43] going to and then at the same exact time
[45:45] go, "Well, Lord, why aren't you
[45:46] answering my prayers? I needed an answer
[45:48] from you." And you know, maybe sometimes
[45:50] we want the the preacher to be done in
[45:52] one hour. I'm not saying I'm going over
[45:54] an hour, so this is But you know, and
[45:56] maybe the Lord wants to come and talk to
[45:57] you at 1 hour and 1 minute. And at one
[46:00] hour, you shut off. We shut off our
[46:03] hearts. We shut off our minds. and the
[46:05] Lord was just right on the other side of
[46:07] what we expected, waiting to talk to us.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; And then sometimes I walk away from
[46:12] church going, "Well, I didn't really get
[46:13] anything out of that." And the Lord
[46:14] would say, "Well, I was there. You felt
[46:16] me in your worship. You welcomed me. You
[46:18] invited me. I just wanted to have
[46:20] preeminence in your service. Let me have
[46:23] preeminence." I'll just get a little bit
[46:24] personal. Sometimes we get uh offended
[46:26] when something's preached, a doctrine
[46:28] that we just don't like, something that
[46:31] we just don't agree with, something we
[46:32] just don't clearly see. might get a
[46:34] little bit offensive there and go,
[46:35] "Well, I don't know if I'm gonna go
[46:36] back."
[46:41] Nobody's ever done that, right?
[46:44] I just don't know if that's the church
[46:46] for me.
[46:48] You know, some stuff were said and I
[46:49] don't really know if I like that. You
[46:51] know, that all of that is by God's
[46:53] design.
[46:56] And I know it's hard to see right now,
[46:57] but can we just let's progress a little
[47:00] bit? You know, maybe the worship's a
[47:01] little bit different. Like we said,
[47:02] maybe the preaching's a little bit
[47:03] different. Maybe the doctrine's
[47:04] different. And I just wonder sometimes
[47:06] if God just gets so tired
[47:09] of all of our attempts to tell people
[47:11] how to believe, Brother Aaron,
[47:14] this is how you should believe. This is
[47:16] how you should sing. This is how you
[47:17] should worship. This is how you should
[47:18] praise the Lord. This is how you should
[47:20] live. This is how you should stand. You
[47:22] got to shout this way. You got to be
[47:24] quiet this way. You got to sit in the
[47:25] pew here. You got to come up to the
[47:27] altar. You got to stay in your seat in
[47:28] the altar. I think the Lord just gets a
[47:30] little bit tired of that. And I think
[47:32] personally if he want if he what the
[47:34] Lord really wants this is my opinion but
[47:36] I think I could back it up by the word
[47:37] of God is not for you to be quiet or for
[47:40] you to be loud or for you to jump and
[47:41] shout or for you to stay still or for
[47:43] you to come up to the altar or for to
[47:45] you preach a certain doctrine or not
[47:46] preach a I think what the Lord God wants
[47:48] is he wants control of you and control
[47:51] of the service
[47:54] &gt;&gt; and he wants to do with the service what
[47:55] he wants to do with the service which
[47:58] almost all the time goes against what I
[48:00] want the service to be Like
[48:03] &gt;&gt; I've seen the Lord when he really comes
[48:04] into control, he makes people who can't
[48:08] do anything but sit in their pew jump
[48:10] and shout and say amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; And then he makes people who can't do
[48:14] anything but jump and shout and say amen
[48:16] sit still in their pew and weep. That's
[48:18] when the Lord has control.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; He has control of our speaking. But no,
[48:23] we want to have I I'm going to I'm going
[48:25] to preach to you from notes. I don't
[48:26] want to have notes. I don't want to have
[48:28] anything. I just want to surrender to
[48:30] the Lord my mouth. And I want you to
[48:33] surrender your heart to the Lord so that
[48:36] he has control of the service. And I
[48:39] tell you, it's not just for service. If
[48:41] you walk out the door and you retain
[48:43] control of your life, you're going to
[48:45] find your life going like this all over
[48:47] the place because he wants the control
[48:49] to continue outside of those doors.
[48:51] Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And if I find myself stumbling, if I
[48:56] find myself going off in a direction
[48:58] that doesn't seem profitable to me, I
[49:00] wonder if I've taken the wheel back from
[49:03] the Lord. Especially sometimes after a
[49:05] service that was so good where I
[49:07] surrendered it and the Lord comes and
[49:09] talks to me and he delivers me and then
[49:11] I go, "Okay, okay. Thanks for getting me
[49:13] back on the right track. Let me take
[49:15] over again.
[49:18] I got this." And maybe, you know, I
[49:21] would say a week later, but maybe
[49:23] sometimes, man, it's like a day later or
[49:25] maybe it's like an hour later, I'm off
[49:26] in the ditch again,
[49:28] thinking that I can steer the thing.
[49:32] But he wants to have preeminence in our
[49:34] lives. He wants to have control of our
[49:36] lives. What does that mean? That means
[49:38] every decision that you make, I I don't
[49:42] know. I I don't know if we can wrap our
[49:43] minds around this one. Every decision
[49:45] you make has nothing to do with you and
[49:48] everything to do with him.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know what? I'm going to decide
[49:54] to do this thing because I believe the
[49:55] Lord's going to be pleased and it will
[49:57] also be good for me. That's not the
[50:00] right thought.
[50:02] Only God matters.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; There was a man I I hope it's okay to
[50:08] read this. This was something that was
[50:09] sent to me. Uh my wife sent me this
[50:11] about a year ago and I just kind of put
[50:13] it to the side and I saved it. But as I
[50:15] was studying it came to my mind uh
[50:17] there's this uh a man in the 1800s a
[50:20] pastor that said this in South Africa.
[50:22] He said humility is perfect quietness of
[50:25] heart.
[50:28] It is to expect nothing and to wonder at
[50:32] nothing that is done to me.
[50:36] to feel nothing done against me.
[50:41] It is to be at rest when nobody praises
[50:44] me
[50:46] and at rest when I am blamed or
[50:48] despised.
[50:51] And I think there's a modern phrase that
[50:54] we say, but it comes from this. The
[50:56] humble person is not the one that thinks
[50:58] badly of himself. He simply does not
[51:01] think of himself at all.
[51:06] And I think there's a modern saying is
[51:07] that humility is not thinking less of
[51:10] yourself. It's thinking of yourself
[51:12] less.
[51:14] And you say, "What does this have to do
[51:15] with what you're talking about?" Blessed
[51:20] is he that is not offended in God. And I
[51:24] think out of all the times that I I
[51:27] believe that we're at the end of time, I
[51:29] I believe it's just so close. And out of
[51:32] all the time that has been, I don't
[51:33] think there's ever been a more offended
[51:38] generation of people than this
[51:39] generation.
[51:41] And I think that that that there's never
[51:44] been more people offended at the word of
[51:46] God than right now.
[51:51] Unless we just think Jesus was just
[51:53] talking for his time and his words just
[51:55] had an end. But I don't believe that. I
[51:57] believe his words are for this time.
[52:00] See, if he's if he's in control, that
[52:03] means you can't be.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's
[52:09] &gt;&gt; that's hard. That's hard. That's That's
[52:12] I mean, that's that's good. But that's
[52:14] hard. You know why? Because I I take
[52:18] control sometimes without even realizing
[52:20] I took control and I took it away from
[52:23] God. Well, I'll do this and I'll do
[52:24] this. The Holy Spirit has to be what's
[52:28] in control of you.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; And it can only be what's in control of
[52:32] you if you're married to it.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; See, if there's still a husband that's
[52:39] alive, if there's still a husband out
[52:40] there,
[52:42] the Holy Spirit can never fully have
[52:44] control of us. And he wants control of
[52:46] your tongue. Definitely your tongue,
[52:48] right?
[52:50] &gt;&gt; All right. Maybe maybe maybe today
[52:52] though it's it's fingers.
[52:55] Right? Gossip used to be hey brother
[52:59] Aaron
[53:00] so and so but now gossip just travels
[53:03] just like this. Right? He wants control
[53:05] of that. I know this is so basic and
[53:07] this is so simple but this I I don't
[53:09] know this is where I I want to show you
[53:11] that that I believe in the scripture
[53:13] that this is one of the last battles
[53:16] that we have.
[53:20] The battle is not how much knowledge do
[53:22] we have. We have so much we have so much
[53:25] scriptural knowledge and revelation
[53:28] like no age has ever had. The battle is
[53:31] how big we get with all that knowledge.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; How do you know if the Lord has control
[53:41] of your life? Anybody think of that
[53:43] question right now? Wait a minute. Okay,
[53:44] I believe that the Lord How do I know
[53:46] when the Lord has control?
[53:50] because of offense.
[53:54] See, the Lord
[53:57] offense is the tool that God uses to
[54:00] show you whether he's in control or not.
[54:05] That sounds strange, right? The Lord's
[54:07] not like that. No, the Lord is like
[54:10] that.
[54:11] See, because he's not going to save you.
[54:14] Can I give you just a little I I hope
[54:15] this is a boost. The Lord cannot save
[54:18] you and lose you.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; You want to have you want to have faith
[54:23] in something?
[54:25] &gt;&gt; The Lord cannot save you and then later
[54:28] on because of things you've done lose
[54:30] you.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; He will not allow you to upset his
[54:35] salvation.
[54:37] I mean, if there's something that should
[54:39] give us a boost this morning is that
[54:41] even I cannot mess up the plan of God
[54:43] for my life.
[54:45] And if somebody could mess it up,
[54:47] brother Manny, it would be me. It would
[54:49] be me. But God will not allow you to
[54:52] mess up his plan for your life.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; He cannot give you of himself and then
[55:00] you be lost. Because listen now, if the
[55:02] Holy Spirit lives right here, if that's
[55:04] the one that I'm married to, then God
[55:07] would be lost if I was lost.
[55:10] because he cannot give you the Holy
[55:12] Ghost and then take it back from you and
[55:14] go, "Okay, well, you made a mistake.
[55:16] You're off there. I'll just give it to
[55:17] somebody else." If he once does a work
[55:19] in you, he'll finish that work. And he
[55:22] cannot allow you to be lost in the
[55:24] meantime. But how does he how does he
[55:27] get us to that place? He gets us to that
[55:28] place by letting us encounter situations
[55:32] and things that see if an offense comes
[55:35] up inside of us.
[55:38] Offense is the tool that God uses to
[55:41] check the condition of your heart and my
[55:43] heart. He wants to check and see who's
[55:45] piloting the ship.
[55:48] Is it you?
[55:50] See, because if you're offended, if I
[55:52] get offended by something, that means
[55:54] there's a something inside that is
[55:56] offended.
[55:59] And God is not offended.
[56:02] See, if there's still a part of me that
[56:04] is that has preeminence, a part of me
[56:07] that is the bigger person in the
[56:08] picture, then there's something to be
[56:10] offended by. You know that if you if you
[56:12] get offended by anything and and I'm
[56:14] telling you, this is a really hard
[56:15] message for me to preach because I feel
[56:17] like I get offended by by things.
[56:21] I don't know about you, but I find
[56:23] myself getting offended by dumb little
[56:25] things. And every time I do, I go, "Oh,
[56:27] there's still some more of Ryan that was
[56:30] alive that needs to die."
[56:34] Offended when my my coffee takes too
[56:36] long.
[56:38] I I can say, "Amen." Because it just
[56:40] happened like two days ago. Offended,
[56:41] right? Because there's still some. And
[56:43] what is God doing? You think God's just
[56:46] saying, "Hey, I just I did that for you.
[56:49] I did that for you." You know, that that
[56:51] was for you to see that there's still
[56:53] somebody else in that control tower.
[56:55] uh he wants to he uses a fence to see
[56:57] who's being worshiped.
[57:01] See, because sometimes the problem is
[57:04] the problem is is is the glory. Where is
[57:06] the glory going to?
[57:10] You know, if we live in an age of
[57:11] anything today is the age of the worship
[57:14] of the woman.
[57:18] Now, I'm not preaching against women.
[57:20] I'm preaching against the spirit that is
[57:22] behind the worship of the woman.
[57:25] And if you think that's just in the
[57:27] world, no, no, no, it's not just in the
[57:28] world. It's that's what I'm saying. If
[57:30] you're married to the church, you're
[57:31] going to have a problem with this even
[57:32] worse than when you're in the world.
[57:34] See, that there's a there's a lifting up
[57:37] of the church above the word of God.
[57:41] Well, the doctrine of the the word says
[57:43] this, but my church says this.
[57:48] Which one you going to take? You going
[57:50] to be offended at the word, or you going
[57:51] to be offended at what the church said?
[57:53] You know, I I'm going to even go Can I
[57:55] go just a little bit farther with that?
[57:56] You know, I I believe Can I just I just
[57:57] want to make a statement. We shouldn't
[57:59] have to make these qualifying
[58:00] statements, but I don't want to offend
[58:01] anybody.
[58:04] I mean, I I I didn't think that would be
[58:06] funny because I was serious. I just
[58:08] don't want to offend anybody. Can I'm
[58:09] going to make a qualifying statement. I
[58:11] believe that I am in the bride of
[58:12] Christ.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; All right. I believe I'm a part of the
[58:15] bride of Christ. despite all my mistakes
[58:17] and despite that I don't deserve to be
[58:19] there, he loved me and he is making me
[58:23] worthy to be in the bride of Christ.
[58:24] Right? But also, if we're not careful,
[58:28] we will worship the bride
[58:31] more than we'll worship the bridegroom.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; We'll worship the title of bride
[58:38] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of the worship of the
[58:40] woman has fallen over us. And we'll say,
[58:43] "Well, I'm in the bride and the bride
[58:45] says this, so that's what I'll do." When
[58:46] that's not what's important. It's what
[58:48] the bridegroom says.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And the bride should be forming herself
[58:53] after what the bridegroom wants to see,
[58:57] &gt;&gt; after what he likes. Now, that takes
[58:59] some real humility because when the Lord
[59:01] does something for you and he lifts you
[59:03] up out of a life of sin and he places
[59:07] you in a place you've never been before,
[59:09] it's very easy to feel exalted.
[59:14] Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Very easy to to You know what? The last
[59:18] enemy, one of the last enemies we're
[59:20] going to battle is pride.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; And pride does not come when I'm in the
[59:25] pig pen.
[59:27] Pride comes when I've been taken out of
[59:29] the pig pen, cleaned up, and placed
[59:32] inside the house of my father. Then I
[59:34] have to battle pride setting in.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Pride that I deserve to be in that spot.
[59:39] pride that well now that I'm in that
[59:41] spot I'll go ahead and do it like I see
[59:43] fit. You know the problem there? I I I I
[59:48] me the B he said in the scripture if you
[59:51] want to follow after me who do you need
[59:54] to deny
[59:55] &gt;&gt; yourself.
[59:57] You got to deny yourself.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Well that sound that's your whole
[1:00:01] message brother. Deny yourself. Try it
[1:00:03] one time.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; You think this is the milk? This is the
[1:00:08] meat of the word. Try one time denying
[1:00:11] yourself. And you know what? You could
[1:00:12] do it. Try two times.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Try it for a day.
[1:00:19] You're going to have you're going to
[1:00:22] have the most upside down day you've
[1:00:24] ever had if you try denying yourself for
[1:00:26] a whole day. I know. I've tried it. But
[1:00:29] yet, that's what we're called to do. And
[1:00:30] you say, "Well, I've denied myself. I'm
[1:00:32] coming to church. I denied myself. I'm
[1:00:34] living a better life." You know Jesus
[1:00:35] said he said you know all of you will
[1:00:39] deny me.
[1:00:41] He said the shepherd gets struck and the
[1:00:43] sheep will scatter. Every single one of
[1:00:45] you deny me. You know what Peter said?
[1:00:47] Oh I'll never I'll never deny you Lord.
[1:00:49] You know what Peter even says in that
[1:00:51] scripture? He said Lord Jesus said all
[1:00:53] of you will be offended.
[1:00:57] And Peter said I'll never be offended.
[1:00:59] He said no. I said you're going to be
[1:01:01] offended. Peter said I'll never be
[1:01:03] offended.
[1:01:04] So if you if you have the testimony, oh
[1:01:06] you know, brother, I don't I'm not
[1:01:08] offended by the word.
[1:01:10] That's not even scriptural.
[1:01:15] It's not even scriptural.
[1:01:17] We know what happens in that story. I am
[1:01:20] Listen now. We are and will be offended
[1:01:25] by the word
[1:01:27] so that it can reveal the part that
[1:01:29] still needs to die.
[1:01:33] I know that's so backwards sometimes
[1:01:35] from our thinking, but the word the word
[1:01:38] is given to us
[1:01:41] to reveal
[1:01:43] the part of us that God cannot he cannot
[1:01:46] have go. He cannot be part of that.
[1:01:49] There there's a part of us that can that
[1:01:52] has no place with God, but he's trying
[1:01:54] to save the part that does. And he does
[1:01:56] that by offense. I know this is just so
[1:01:58] kind of backwards, but and it says this.
[1:02:01] There's another in the Bible when it
[1:02:03] says offended. Be be blessed is he that
[1:02:05] is not offended. There's a whole
[1:02:07] actually different set of definitions to
[1:02:09] that word. It says to trip up, to ent
[1:02:12] trap, to cause, to fall away.
[1:02:19] You say, "Wait a minute. Blessed is he
[1:02:21] who is not offended." You know what
[1:02:23] Jesus is saying? Blessed is he. Now,
[1:02:26] this you got to wrap. This is not this
[1:02:28] is not milk. Think about this from a
[1:02:31] from a from a standpoint, but I know I
[1:02:32] know that you can take it. I know that
[1:02:34] you could understand this by the grace
[1:02:35] of God. Blessed is he who Jesus himself
[1:02:39] cannot even cause to fall away.
[1:02:42] You say, "Wait a minute. Okay, hold up.
[1:02:45] Time out. Jesus is not going to do that
[1:02:47] to me." No. No. God is going to do that.
[1:02:50] You know why? Because he can't lose you.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; He can't lose you. and you say, "Well, I
[1:02:56] need some scripture." Let's go to Second
[1:02:57] Thessalonians. If you want to just jot
[1:02:59] it down, I'll just turn to it real
[1:03:01] quick.
[1:03:03] I know I know this gets a little bit uh
[1:03:04] dicey right in this area, but uh I
[1:03:07] believe it's in this scripture. And I I
[1:03:09] know that that doesn't sound that sounds
[1:03:12] cruel, doesn't it? Does it sound a
[1:03:14] little bit unfair that God would do
[1:03:15] that? And that's the first thing is
[1:03:17] that's one of the first tests. Will you
[1:03:20] be offended when you find out that God
[1:03:22] himself is the one causing the offense?
[1:03:27] You know, there's a huge doctrinal point
[1:03:29] that I don't think we struggle with, but
[1:03:30] in the world, it's one of the biggest
[1:03:32] doctrinal struggles, and that's a
[1:03:34] baptism,
[1:03:36] right? Is it baptism in the Father, Son,
[1:03:38] and Holy Ghost, or is the baptism in the
[1:03:40] Lord Jesus Christ? Well, if you if you
[1:03:41] if you've gotten a revelation of what it
[1:03:43] is, you're like, I don't struggle with
[1:03:44] that. That's pretty easy. But who's the
[1:03:46] one who had introduced the doctrine that
[1:03:48] causes the struggle?
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus did.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Why? because his will not be deceived.
[1:03:58] His seed will not go off into error.
[1:04:02] You say, "Well, that I don't know about
[1:04:04] that. That just sounds cruel." But let's
[1:04:05] just let's just look at what what he's
[1:04:07] talking about here. Is this still okay?
[1:04:09] I know this is not good. I know this is
[1:04:11] not like jump up and down preaching, but
[1:04:14] I pray that this I trust that this
[1:04:16] strengthens us in this day of offense.
[1:04:23] 2 Thessalonians 2:3, "Let no man deceive
[1:04:27] you by any means, for that day shall not
[1:04:29] come except there except there come a
[1:04:32] falling away first.
[1:04:38] That day shall not come except there
[1:04:40] come an offense,
[1:04:43] an offending for that man of sin and
[1:04:45] that man of sin be revealed the son of
[1:04:47] pision predition who opposeth and
[1:04:50] exalted who
[1:04:52] himself.
[1:04:56] Who is he talking about? Anybody who
[1:05:00] lifts up themsself
[1:05:02] over God
[1:05:05] above all that is called God or that is
[1:05:07] worshiped. So he so that he as God
[1:05:10] siteth in the temple of God showing
[1:05:12] himself that he is God. Where is the
[1:05:14] temple of God? Let's just start out real
[1:05:16] simple. Where is the temple of God?
[1:05:18] Right here.
[1:05:20] So who's sitting in the temple of God,
[1:05:24] man? He said Jesus.
[1:05:27] What if I'm sitting there?
[1:05:30] What if I'm still in the control tower
[1:05:32] sitting there? You know what I've done?
[1:05:33] I've just fulfilled verse four. that
[1:05:36] because I'm sitting in the temple of
[1:05:37] God, I actually am God.
[1:05:42] Remember ye not that when I was with
[1:05:44] you, I told you these things,
[1:05:47] and now you know what withholdeth, that
[1:05:50] he might be revealed in this time.
[1:05:53] For the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:05:55] work, only he who now letth will let
[1:05:59] until he be taken out of the way. And
[1:06:01] then shall that wicked be revealed, whom
[1:06:03] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[1:06:04] of his mouth, and shall destroy with the
[1:06:06] brightness of his coming, even him whose
[1:06:08] coming is after the working of Satan,
[1:06:11] with all power, signs, and wonders,
[1:06:16] and with all deceivleness of
[1:06:18] unrighteousness in them that perish,
[1:06:19] because they receive not the love of the
[1:06:21] truth, that they might be saved. And for
[1:06:23] this cause God shall send them strong
[1:06:27] delusion, that they should believe a
[1:06:29] lie.
[1:06:34] that they all might be damned who
[1:06:35] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[1:06:37] and unrighteousness. Who's sending the
[1:06:40] strong delusion?
[1:06:42] You know what God's going to do? You
[1:06:44] know what he has been doing? Even if we
[1:06:45] don't realize it, he's been sending you
[1:06:48] reasons to be offended.
[1:06:52] You say, "Well, I I must have failed."
[1:06:55] That's okay. That's why he sent it.
[1:06:58] See, there's a there's a scripture in
[1:06:59] the Bible, too. He talks about uh I
[1:07:01] think it's in Matthew 15. You know,
[1:07:03] there's a woman that comes to him. She's
[1:07:04] a Sarapheneician woman. She's not a Jew.
[1:07:07] She's a Greek. She comes to him and
[1:07:09] says, "Lord, I have I have a need for
[1:07:11] you. I I have somebody sick at home."
[1:07:13] You know, if you don't know, you know
[1:07:15] what I'm talking about this story. You
[1:07:16] know what he tells her? It's not meat.
[1:07:20] It's not good to take the children's
[1:07:23] food and give it to the dogs.
[1:07:27] I don't know about you. Okay, let's I
[1:07:29] know this has been preached on a lot of
[1:07:31] times, but if you came into church this
[1:07:34] morning and Brother Dan started calling
[1:07:36] you dogs,
[1:07:39] how many would go, I'm not going back.
[1:07:45] I don't know. That'd be hard for me to
[1:07:46] take
[1:07:48] you dogs.
[1:07:50] You bunch of dogs.
[1:07:53] And yet Jesus himself calls this woman a
[1:07:56] dog.
[1:07:58] Now if anybody listen now if anybody was
[1:08:00] going to be offended, it was her. You
[1:08:04] know what she did?
[1:08:07] Truth Lord.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Truth Lord.
[1:08:14] There was nothing
[1:08:17] left inside to be offended by it.
[1:08:21] She had denied herself. The need of her
[1:08:24] heart was greater
[1:08:27] than her own self.
[1:08:31] And she came to the only one who could
[1:08:33] answer that need. We know that. But do
[1:08:35] you think do you think he was mean?
[1:08:37] Sounds mean.
[1:08:40] But without that test, she never her
[1:08:43] faith he nobody would have known what
[1:08:45] her faith was. And yet here we are 2,000
[1:08:47] years later talking about this woman
[1:08:49] because God calls her a dog and she
[1:08:52] says, "True, Lord."
[1:08:54] True, but I still have a need.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; And as a dog, I still have rights
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; to what falls off the table of a child
[1:09:06] of God. And he says, "Your words, that's
[1:09:10] faith that I've been looking for."
[1:09:13] It seems so strange that God would cause
[1:09:16] that situation and yet he puts every
[1:09:19] single one of us to that test.
[1:09:22] Every single one of us that test. Are
[1:09:24] you going to be offended
[1:09:26] when something said at church that you
[1:09:28] maybe just didn't like? What are you
[1:09:29] going to do?
[1:09:31] I'm never going back.
[1:09:34] I'll go find another church. Or you
[1:09:37] going to say, you know what?
[1:09:40] True, Lord.
[1:09:42] True. But I have a need on my heart. I
[1:09:46] have something I hate need of so much
[1:09:48] that I don't care what you call me. I
[1:09:50] don't care how you look at me. I'm going
[1:09:53] to crawl up to you, even as a dog, and
[1:09:56] I'm going to ask for it.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; You want to talk about humility is when
[1:10:01] there's nothing left inside to be
[1:10:03] offended.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; I I I got to confess, I'm just I don't
[1:10:08] think I'm there yet.
[1:10:10] There's still there's still things said
[1:10:12] where I'm just like, I don't know about
[1:10:13] that. Something's preached and well, I
[1:10:16] just don't know about what was said
[1:10:17] right there. Even just a little
[1:10:18] uprising. You know how you know what God
[1:10:20] does that? He doesn't need to see that
[1:10:21] reaction. You do.
[1:10:25] He He knows He knows who you are.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need to see how you reacted
[1:10:29] to him. He wants you to see the
[1:10:31] reaction. Is there still something that
[1:10:33] needs to go out and die? See, because he
[1:10:35] knows all that are his. Amen. He knows
[1:10:37] all that are his and those that aren't.
[1:10:39] And the Bible says straight is the gay
[1:10:41] and gate and narrow is the way. And we
[1:10:43] say okay well that's good. Straight is
[1:10:44] the gate. But if there's a way to make
[1:10:46] it to the Lord if there's a pathway and
[1:10:48] there's a direction that means anything
[1:10:50] besides that direction is separating
[1:10:53] those into the lost. You say oh God is a
[1:10:56] good God. He is a good God. But if he
[1:10:58] makes a gate that you have to go through
[1:11:00] at the same time all those that don't go
[1:11:02] through that gate are not his.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And who did that? God did that.
[1:11:07] If he creates and he causes an offense,
[1:11:14] it's just so hard to to wrap our minds
[1:11:16] around sometimes, but if he causes an
[1:11:18] offense, it's to see who's going to be
[1:11:21] offended. If you're going to be
[1:11:22] offended, what are you going to do about
[1:11:23] it?
[1:11:26] You're going to you're going to latch on
[1:11:27] to that offense. You're going to root
[1:11:28] out the reason why there was an offense
[1:11:30] to begin with and find out where the
[1:11:33] real problem is. Amen.
[1:11:36] In 1 John 4:1, he says this, uh,
[1:11:41] beloved, believe not every spirit, but
[1:11:42] try the spirits whether they are of God,
[1:11:44] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:11:46] into the world. Hereby know ye the
[1:11:49] spirit of God. Every spirit that
[1:11:50] confessth that Jesus Christ has come in
[1:11:52] the flesh is of God. Every spirit that
[1:11:54] confesseth not that Jesus Christ has
[1:11:56] come in the flesh is not of God. And
[1:11:57] this is the spirit of Antichrist,
[1:11:59] whereof ye have heard that it should
[1:12:01] come, and even now already is in the
[1:12:03] world.
[1:12:05] Ye are of God, little children.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; You are of God, little children. I I
[1:12:12] don't care if you just came into the if
[1:12:14] you just came into church yesterday or
[1:12:16] 10 years ago. You are of God. He has put
[1:12:19] in you an overcoming power.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, wait a minute. I've
[1:12:25] overcoming power. I don't even
[1:12:26] understand. I haven't even read half the
[1:12:27] Bible. I don't understand." He has put
[1:12:29] in you an overcoming power to overcome
[1:12:34] this one.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; You want to overcome the world? Let's
[1:12:38] overcome this world.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to I'm not going to try to
[1:12:42] change the world, but I we'll go we
[1:12:44] witness to the world. We speak to the
[1:12:46] world, but this is the world I need to
[1:12:48] overcome. Ye are of God, little
[1:12:49] children, and have overcome them because
[1:12:51] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:12:54] that is in the world. They are of the
[1:12:55] world, therefore they speak of the
[1:12:57] world, and the world heareth them. We
[1:12:59] are of God. He that knoweth God heareth
[1:13:02] us. He that is not of God heareth not
[1:13:04] us. Hereby, this is how you know the
[1:13:07] spirit of truth and the spirit of of
[1:13:10] error. This is how you know. Oh, wait a
[1:13:13] minute. This thing that I was offended
[1:13:14] by, this thing that I heard that I
[1:13:15] didn't like. Oh, this is God testing me.
[1:13:20] Or I could just be offended. I could
[1:13:22] just be offended and say, "Well, there's
[1:13:23] nothing to that. I'll just Yeah, I'll
[1:13:25] just go listen to somewhere else. Or by
[1:13:27] the spirit of God, you'll know. Wait a
[1:13:29] minute. Lord, you did that for a reason.
[1:13:32] You did that for a reason. Oh, Lord,
[1:13:34] you're testing me. Where where is it?
[1:13:36] Where's the part of me that's offended
[1:13:37] by you? That's the part I want to be rid
[1:13:40] of. Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; There's a way that seemth right. Right.
[1:13:45] And there's a way that seemth true. The
[1:13:48] control of the Holy Ghost means the
[1:13:49] death of the one that was controlling in
[1:13:51] the first place.
[1:13:54] You know, there's a difference. Being
[1:13:55] born into the world, being born into
[1:13:56] Tucson Tabernacle, being born into a
[1:13:58] church, being born into the message,
[1:14:00] being born all those things. Those
[1:14:02] births won't bring you anything but
[1:14:05] offense.
[1:14:08] There's only one birth. Oh, the word
[1:14:10] says this. What does my church say? That
[1:14:12] might be a new birth, but it's not the
[1:14:14] new birth.
[1:14:17] And the birth of somebody, the birth of
[1:14:19] the church alone. Sometimes somebody's
[1:14:20] born into a church and they don't find
[1:14:22] out for 20 years they were born into the
[1:14:23] church
[1:14:26] because they've just been going along. I
[1:14:27] just been going I know I was born into a
[1:14:29] church going along with a church for
[1:14:31] most of my life just going along with
[1:14:33] what the church says. And then all of a
[1:14:35] sudden just thing after thing started to
[1:14:37] come and I realized oh Lord I was never
[1:14:39] the things I were getting offended at
[1:14:40] was the word of God. And the thing I was
[1:14:43] taking over the word of God was what my
[1:14:45] church said, what my pastor said, what
[1:14:47] my what my family said, what I said. And
[1:14:51] the word of God was saying something
[1:14:52] different. And you would say, "Oh,
[1:14:53] that's ins there's no way you would take
[1:14:55] that over the word of God." It happens
[1:14:57] just like that. It happens so easily
[1:15:00] without us knowing. And and the word of
[1:15:02] God is is is made this way to test us.
[1:15:05] Amen. The Holy Spirit. And that birth is
[1:15:07] a different birth.
[1:15:11] And even with the new birth, we want
[1:15:14] control of it. You know that.
[1:15:17] Can I give you an example?
[1:15:20] We say, "We got the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:25] I got the Holy Ghost."
[1:15:31] How about the Holy Ghost getting you?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's just a phrase. Come on
[1:15:37] now. That's just a sentence." You're
[1:15:38] right. It is just a sentence. But I
[1:15:40] don't want to be in control.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just have the Holy
[1:15:45] Ghost.
[1:15:48] I think sometimes that's a problem is I
[1:15:50] have the Holy Ghost, Brother Aaron. But
[1:15:52] does it have me?
[1:15:56] Because if I have it, it could just be a
[1:15:57] real good outside anointing. I feel
[1:15:59] good. I praise the Lord. I go out
[1:16:01] refreshed. I go out ready to ready to
[1:16:03] fight the world. And then it's gone
[1:16:06] because maybe it never had me. And I I
[1:16:08] I'm not just trying to turn a phrase to
[1:16:10] be to be cute. These are meaningful
[1:16:12] things. And it's it's so meaningful that
[1:16:14] God puts them in the Bible. Puts them
[1:16:17] right in the Bible and and has somebody
[1:16:20] who's just so inefficient to come and
[1:16:22] talk about it. But it's but it's but go
[1:16:24] search it out. It has meaning in the
[1:16:26] Bible. What about the Holy Ghost has got
[1:16:28] me? What a difference it makes when the
[1:16:30] Holy Ghost has you. Because if the Holy
[1:16:33] Ghost have you, then then your burden is
[1:16:36] light. your yoke is easy.
[1:16:40] Because you make no mistakes. No.
[1:16:45] No. Absolutely not. And that's one of
[1:16:47] the biggest lies of the devil
[1:16:50] is to tell you, "Oh, look, you made a
[1:16:52] mistake again. I guess you didn't have
[1:16:55] that thing that you said you had."
[1:16:57] That's that's nothing but a that's
[1:16:58] nothing but a lie.
[1:17:01] And I know you say that's such a simple
[1:17:04] thing to preach about, but I know that's
[1:17:06] the attack of the devil on most of the
[1:17:07] people in the church of God.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Is go, "Oh, well, you never had it to
[1:17:13] begin with. See, you never had it to
[1:17:15] begin with because you went out and did
[1:17:17] that thing that you said you weren't
[1:17:18] going to do. But the but the spirit of
[1:17:21] God will cause you to come back."
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; See, I it's not about whether you fall
[1:17:26] down or not, right?
[1:17:28] The spirit of God is not going to
[1:17:30] prevent you. Listen, the spirit of God
[1:17:32] is not going to prevent you from falling
[1:17:33] down.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is not going to
[1:17:36] prevent us from being offended. The
[1:17:40] spirit of God is going to cause you to
[1:17:41] get back up every single time you fall.
[1:17:44] The spirit of God is going to cause you
[1:17:46] to go, "Man, I was offended. Why was I
[1:17:48] offended?
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Let me search out the reason." No, no,
[1:17:52] no. It's not brother Dan. It's not
[1:17:54] brother so and so. It's not the sister
[1:17:56] over here that say it's not the Bible.
[1:17:58] It's not God. There's something inside
[1:18:00] that has to die. And the Holy Spirit
[1:18:02] will cause you to search out that thing
[1:18:05] and go put go put it to death. Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; It's not because we don't make mistakes.
[1:18:11] I think I think that the the prophet
[1:18:13] says in the message that we backslide
[1:18:16] many times
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; every day.
[1:18:25] There's some people that that are
[1:18:26] offended by that. I'm not offended by
[1:18:28] that. That gives me that gives me hope.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; That gives me a hope that I wouldn't
[1:18:33] have had otherwise.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read you this. It says,
[1:18:38] "The Holy Spirit brings you into
[1:18:40] operation or in control of God." This is
[1:18:43] out of what it takes to make a Christian
[1:18:45] life. or in control of God and that you
[1:18:48] walk in peace and in love and in joy
[1:18:50] with longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[1:18:52] gentleness, patience. You see, it isn't
[1:18:55] something you do.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; How come you can say, "Thank the Lord.
[1:19:00] It's not something that I do because
[1:19:03] every single time I do it, Brother
[1:19:05] Aaron, it goes wrong."
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you know what I'm
[1:19:12] talking about, brother. Right. Every
[1:19:13] single time I do it, it goes good for a
[1:19:17] while. Oh, I'm feeling good. I'm walking
[1:19:18] in his ways and then, oh man, what
[1:19:21] happened there?
[1:19:23] I'm off. I'm off in the weeds again.
[1:19:28] How do I know that happens? Offense
[1:19:30] comes
[1:19:32] and I know there's still a man that
[1:19:33] needs to die inside. It isn't something
[1:19:35] that you do. It's something the Holy
[1:19:37] Spirit does in you. You see, it's no
[1:19:40] longer an intellectual thought of your
[1:19:42] own. It's a subconscious moving of the
[1:19:46] Holy Spirit.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; What what a what a joy should come to
[1:19:51] our hearts that it doesn't have anything
[1:19:53] to do with you controlling it, you
[1:19:56] moving it, and you making it happen.
[1:19:57] It's a subconscious movement of the Holy
[1:20:00] Spirit. It'd be like if I told you, you
[1:20:02] know what, brother? Uh you know what,
[1:20:04] brother? I I want you to dream a dream
[1:20:06] tonight.
[1:20:08] I want you to dream this specific dream.
[1:20:09] Go try and see if you could do it,
[1:20:11] right? This is what I want you to go to
[1:20:13] sleep tonight and I want you to dream
[1:20:14] about this. You're not going to dream
[1:20:17] about it. But when it's a subconscious
[1:20:20] movement of the Holy Spirit, it does
[1:20:21] what it wants. That's how that's how in
[1:20:23] control the Holy Spirit should be of our
[1:20:25] lives. It is I I don't know. It's just
[1:20:29] such a foreign thought to us sometimes.
[1:20:31] But but maybe it's just me. Maybe it's
[1:20:33] not a foreign thought to you, but for me
[1:20:34] it's I want him in control while I'm
[1:20:37] sleeping, while I'm awake, when I'm
[1:20:39] talking to somebody, and that and that
[1:20:41] those words come out of my mouth that
[1:20:42] are coming from a point of I want him to
[1:20:44] take that and capture it before it comes
[1:20:46] out.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; That's how that's the way I want to be.
[1:20:49] I I I'm working towards that. What is
[1:20:51] it? It doesn't mean an experience that
[1:20:53] you shouted or spoke with tongues. Those
[1:20:55] things are fine. It's not preaching
[1:20:57] against it,
[1:20:59] but that's not what I'm talking about.
[1:21:00] your if your life doesn't cooperate and
[1:21:03] doesn't testify of your emotions that
[1:21:07] when you receive the holy that when you
[1:21:09] spoke of tongues and then you're
[1:21:10] deceived because the Holy Spirit takes
[1:21:13] your innermost being
[1:21:17] and controls you as you are and makes
[1:21:21] you and forms you into a Christian man
[1:21:25] or woman.
[1:21:28] Most of my life I've tried to become a
[1:21:30] Christian man or woman.
[1:21:33] Anybody else?
[1:21:37] Anybody else? Has it worked for?
[1:21:40] I'm glad there's no hands that went up
[1:21:41] on that one.
[1:21:43] I don't know. This is like this is about
[1:21:45] as simple as a message you could get,
[1:21:46] but but if but if it doesn't work,
[1:21:50] why do I keep doing it?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:55] It's like if I hit my head against the
[1:21:57] wall and it hurts, why do I keep hitting
[1:21:59] my head against the wall?
[1:22:06] I I'm finishing up. I I know this is
[1:22:08] this is about as slow as it could get,
[1:22:09] but
[1:22:13] it forms you into a Christian man or
[1:22:15] woman. It ticks off with your life. It
[1:22:17] matches your life. There's something in
[1:22:19] you pushing you to make you do it
[1:22:21] anyhow. It makes you love those who spit
[1:22:25] on you.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; See, if you're in control, you'll get
[1:22:30] offended when they spit on you.
[1:22:33] Sometimes it's even like righteous
[1:22:35] righteous offense, right? How dare you
[1:22:37] spit on me? I I I I have the truth. I'm
[1:22:40] talking about the truth. How dare you
[1:22:41] spit on me? If you spit on me, you're
[1:22:43] spitting on the word of God. You know,
[1:22:46] that's just that's me being offended.
[1:22:48] God's not offended by that. He knows
[1:22:50] whose is his. He knows who's not his.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; But sometimes I get offended for God.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And if he's not offended, why am I being
[1:23:00] offended by it? But his spirit will say,
[1:23:03] "Oh, you know, they spit on you." Look,
[1:23:05] they spit on you. Love them.
[1:23:10] And he didn't just tell you to do this.
[1:23:12] He did this. He's hanging on the cross
[1:23:15] and those spitting on him and those
[1:23:17] mocking him and those doing anything, he
[1:23:19] says, "Lord, don't hold this against
[1:23:22] them. Put this on my account."
[1:23:28] I I I don't know. That's a That's a That
[1:23:30] is a a step. I don't know if you're
[1:23:33] there. If you're there, praise the Lord.
[1:23:35] I'm not trying to say anybody else is
[1:23:36] not there. That's a step that you cannot
[1:23:39] make without the Holy Ghost having
[1:23:41] complete control of the ship.
[1:23:45] And he cannot have complete control of
[1:23:47] the ship if I keep grabbing the wheel
[1:23:50] from him.
[1:23:53] When you get this spirit in you, sorry,
[1:23:55] it makes you love those that spit on
[1:23:57] you. It makes you love those who said
[1:24:00] you're insane.
[1:24:03] When you get the spirit in you, then the
[1:24:05] burdens of life become light. You don't
[1:24:08] notice it anymore. How many want some
[1:24:09] light burdens?
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; The yoke is lined with feathers. It
[1:24:16] becomes so easy. And then the people
[1:24:17] that pile things on you, Amen. We I mean
[1:24:21] that if anything should get an amen,
[1:24:23] it's that people pile things on top of
[1:24:25] you.
[1:24:27] You're like Samson at the gates of Gaza
[1:24:29] and pick up the big brass gate and just
[1:24:31] pack it on up the hill.
[1:24:34] When you get to a place that the Holy
[1:24:36] Spirit has got you,
[1:24:40] not you, the Holy Spirit.
[1:24:43] I take it right out of the message, but
[1:24:44] the Holy Spirit has got you. You say, "I
[1:24:46] got the Holy Ghost." I don't think that
[1:24:48] should be said. You must say, "The Holy
[1:24:51] Ghost got me."
[1:24:54] Then when you Holy Ghost gets you the
[1:24:56] burden and the yoke is easy, then you
[1:24:58] pick up the big gates of Gaza and pack
[1:25:00] them straight to Calvary. And there on
[1:25:04] Calvary, you lay them at the feet of
[1:25:05] Jesus and pray for your enemies.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Not with a grudge, Lord, if you just
[1:25:12] bust them open. Man,
[1:25:16] I love the way that it's just so plain.
[1:25:20] I just make a confession. And you know
[1:25:21] how many times I've gone to the Lord and
[1:25:23] Lord if you just I didn't say would you
[1:25:25] bust him open
[1:25:27] but Lord you know you try to make I
[1:25:30] don't mean to be funny but it's you put
[1:25:32] it in a way where you think it's
[1:25:33] pleasing to the Lord. Lord if you would
[1:25:35] just if you just bring some correction
[1:25:37] to them.
[1:25:39] Lord if you would just show them show
[1:25:42] them your way. If you would just and the
[1:25:44] Lord's like you're the one offended.
[1:25:49] You're the one offended by what they
[1:25:50] did. Why would I bring them correction?
[1:25:52] I'm trying to bring you correction.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; See, there's still something inside
[1:25:57] that's offended when somebody does. And
[1:26:00] we're talking about brothers. Can we
[1:26:02] just be frank? We get offended by
[1:26:03] brothers and sisters and they're not
[1:26:05] spitting on us.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they just say one little
[1:26:09] sentence in a certain tone that we
[1:26:11] didn't like and we want to go before the
[1:26:14] Lord and go, "Lord, would you just bust
[1:26:16] them open?"
[1:26:17] I'm not saying we pray that way, but
[1:26:19] right, Lord, I you know, I just don't
[1:26:22] know about them. I They shouldn't have
[1:26:23] had that spirit against me and I I
[1:26:25] didn't do anything wrong. Yes. You know,
[1:26:27] sometimes you didn't do anything wrong
[1:26:28] and you still we still get offended,
[1:26:30] right? The Lord just showing us there's
[1:26:32] something inside that's still got to
[1:26:34] die.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you just bust him open, no, no,
[1:26:40] no, no. with something though from your
[1:26:42] heart that says, "Dear God, that man is
[1:26:46] a man like I am."
[1:26:49] It It's It's such a uh
[1:26:55] It's such a uh backwards way of thinking
[1:26:57] from my thinking. And that's that's the
[1:27:00] whole point. That's the whole point of
[1:27:03] God being in control of the ship is that
[1:27:05] it isn't done the way I would do things.
[1:27:09] And and I I I tell you, I feel a little
[1:27:12] bad because this is so broken up and
[1:27:14] this is so this is not a this is not a
[1:27:17] like a rallying kind of message, but
[1:27:21] when I when I read about this and I see
[1:27:23] it in the Bible and I see it in the word
[1:27:25] and then I go out and try to do it,
[1:27:29] I'm so disappointed in myself
[1:27:32] and I become so discouraged in myself
[1:27:34] when I go out and try to do this and
[1:27:36] God's saying, "Listen, listen. You can't
[1:27:38] do it.
[1:27:41] You can't. That's the whole point.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. If you are going to try
[1:27:46] to listen, listen to me, my my brothers
[1:27:48] and sister. If you're going to try to
[1:27:49] not be offended, you you'll fail.
[1:27:53] You're going to be offended by
[1:27:55] something. Maybe nothing I say would
[1:27:57] offend you, but something somewhere is
[1:27:59] going to be preached from a pulpit or or
[1:28:02] worshiped in a song or said to you from
[1:28:04] somebody, and it's going to be a test of
[1:28:06] whether you're going to be offended or
[1:28:07] not. And as long as you are trying,
[1:28:10] there's a problem.
[1:28:13] Neither am I saying you just let go and
[1:28:14] live how you want to, right? That's
[1:28:16] that's not what we're talking about. But
[1:28:18] it can I cannot be in control even when
[1:28:20] it's going good.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And when the Lord gets it going good, if
[1:28:25] I take back over control, where am I
[1:28:27] going to be at? I'm going to be right in
[1:28:28] the same spot where he when he when he
[1:28:30] rescued me the last time.
[1:28:32] and and and it doesn't and and he's
[1:28:34] like, "Well, as I grow as I grow in the
[1:28:37] Lord, brother Aaron, I should get better
[1:28:39] at this." No, no, no. To grow I I I've
[1:28:42] had the whole I've had the wrong concept
[1:28:44] about growing in the Lord. Growing in
[1:28:46] the Lord is not me getting bigger. It's
[1:28:48] me getting smaller.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; See, as revelation from the Lord pours
[1:28:53] into your life, revelation, oh, this I
[1:28:55] got a revelation, brother. This little
[1:28:57] thing, just this little thing that I
[1:28:58] just can't do it. To me, it's just a
[1:29:00] small thing, but I got a revelation. He
[1:29:02] got bigger in your life and you got
[1:29:04] smaller.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; It's so good because then the amount of
[1:29:08] things that I get offended by also get
[1:29:11] smaller.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; And then when he brings the next thing
[1:29:14] to my mind, oh, you got offended by
[1:29:16] this. Make room. I'll come in there and
[1:29:18] you won't be offended by that thing
[1:29:20] again. Oh, you know who sent that thing?
[1:29:22] The Lord says, I sent it to you. I sent
[1:29:25] it to you because I wanted you to see
[1:29:27] me. I wanted you to know that you are
[1:29:29] still trying to pilot the ship and you
[1:29:32] know it because you got offended.
[1:29:34] It's such a weird thing. It's like,
[1:29:36] well, he's going to use offense. Yes,
[1:29:37] he's going to use offense to to reveal
[1:29:39] to us that I need more of him. What a
[1:29:42] blessing. What an absolute blessing of
[1:29:45] the Lord. Blessed is he who is not
[1:29:47] offended in me.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; That means Lord, you are in control. I I
[1:29:55] know. I know. have searched it out that
[1:29:58] that old husband has died. And if you
[1:30:02] got to start somewhere this morning,
[1:30:03] start by searching out that whole that
[1:30:05] old husband. Did you just put him away?
[1:30:09] Oh, I separated from him. No, he doesn't
[1:30:11] have part in my life. I'm I'm sorry, but
[1:30:13] the Lord cannot have control. He cannot
[1:30:16] have control until that old husband is
[1:30:18] dead.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I know that's that's so basic, but but I
[1:30:22] I I just think a lot of times that's
[1:30:24] been forgotten. And Lord, he wants to
[1:30:26] come in. He wants to He wants to have
[1:30:29] control
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; more than anything.
[1:30:35] But are we going to give it to him?
[1:30:37] That's the question. Am I going to give
[1:30:39] it to him? I mean, yes.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; But how do you do it?
[1:30:47] Right? How do I do it? It's you. It it's
[1:30:52] just
[1:30:53] your survival
[1:30:57] sometimes takes over and the right when
[1:30:59] the Lord wants to take control,
[1:31:03] something inside
[1:31:05] at the very last minute snatches it back
[1:31:07] away from him.
[1:31:10] Like a like a last death grasp. No, no,
[1:31:12] no. I'm gonna hold on. I'm gonna hold
[1:31:13] on. And the Lord says, "You were almost
[1:31:16] there.
[1:31:17] You were almost there. where I almost
[1:31:20] had control, but there was still
[1:31:22] something in life fighting me. It wasn't
[1:31:24] Satan fighting him. It wasn't the world
[1:31:26] fighting him. It was this person
[1:31:28] fighting him. If you want to walk after
[1:31:31] him, you got to deny yourself.
[1:31:34] And you know there's something to deny
[1:31:37] when an offense comes.
[1:31:40] You say, "I got no, brother. You You
[1:31:42] don't understand. There's legit reasons
[1:31:44] to be offended." If Jesus can call you a
[1:31:47] dog
[1:31:48] and you say, "True, Lord, I that's the
[1:31:50] spirit I want." I don't know about you,
[1:31:52] that's the spirit that I want. I want I
[1:31:54] want the Lord to be able to say anything
[1:31:55] to me. I can say, "True, Lord." You know
[1:31:57] why it's true? It's coming from you,
[1:31:58] Lord. True, Lord.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; It It's true, Lord. Yes, I am that. But
[1:32:02] as a even as a dog, I have rights that
[1:32:06] you gave me. By faith, I have rights.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; It's not because I'm anything. It's
[1:32:12] because I recognize my place. See, her
[1:32:15] that that that woman's her victory was
[1:32:18] not about recognizing who she was. It
[1:32:21] was about recognizing who he was.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; She didn't care who she was.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; She didn't care if he thought of her as
[1:32:29] a dog, if he saw her as the lowest of
[1:32:32] the low. It wasn't about her. Nothing
[1:32:34] about her even lived anymore. She only
[1:32:37] put him first.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; That's what I want that this morning.
[1:32:40] That That's what I want more than
[1:32:41] anything. This is so I'm sorry. This is
[1:32:43] so just broken up and it's just a I've
[1:32:46] made a mess of this. But that is what I
[1:32:48] want more than anything. And and if if
[1:32:50] somehow if somehow that was somehow
[1:32:53] conveyed in this, I I pray that's the
[1:32:55] what you walk away with is that if if
[1:32:58] there is something that is bothered by
[1:33:01] the preaching of the word, let's seek
[1:33:02] out why it's bothered by that. Don't
[1:33:04] don't put the fault on the word. Don't
[1:33:06] put the fault on the preacher. Don't put
[1:33:07] the fault here. Let's search out why
[1:33:10] there's an offense. You know, it could
[1:33:11] just be coming from the Lord.
[1:33:15] You say, "No, no, it's not coming from
[1:33:17] the Lord." Oh, no. He He'll cause it.
[1:33:20] He'll cause it to to test. I I I I don't
[1:33:23] know. I I feel like I there's more I
[1:33:25] could say, but I just I feel like that's
[1:33:26] a good stopping point. And you forgive
[1:33:29] me. I
[1:33:34] I just I feel inadequate as a speaker
[1:33:36] and as a preacher, but I know that what
[1:33:38] I'm telling you is the truth.
[1:33:41] I wish you hear good preachers and I
[1:33:44] wish I could preach it like them,
[1:33:45] brother Aaron. I wish it. But it's the
[1:33:48] truth. Whether I know how to tell it to
[1:33:50] you or not, whether I know how to
[1:33:51] express it to you or not, it's the
[1:33:54] truth. And and and and I pray that I
[1:33:57] pray that nothing I said offended you.
[1:33:59] And and and part of me prays that
[1:34:01] something I said offended you.
[1:34:03] And not because I want to be offensive,
[1:34:05] but but listen, it has to this has to
[1:34:08] become real.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; This is good if it's just, oh, you know,
[1:34:12] that was a great that was good sermon. I
[1:34:14] got something out of it. But this is
[1:34:16] real, brothers and sisters. This is
[1:34:17] real. And when that offense comes, what
[1:34:19] am I going to do? It's coming.
[1:34:22] It's coming. It might be coming right
[1:34:23] now. Some of you are like, I don't
[1:34:24] really like that,
[1:34:26] but it's coming. What am I going to do?
[1:34:29] I need I I tell you what it it that that
[1:34:31] that that old saying that I was telling
[1:34:33] you is like to think nothing when
[1:34:35] something is done against me. Well,
[1:34:38] that's a victory. That is a victory in
[1:34:39] the Lord. I I'm just not there yet. But
[1:34:42] Lord, you got to take me there. If you
[1:34:44] started a work in me, you're going to
[1:34:45] finish that work. And and and that's
[1:34:48] that's the only hope I have. That's the
[1:34:49] faith that I have that because
[1:34:53] because he came to live inside me, I
[1:34:56] cannot be lost.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I cannot be deceived. I'm going to
[1:35:00] make mistakes. I'm going to trip. I'm
[1:35:01] going to fall. But I cannot be unsaved
[1:35:05] once I'm saved.
[1:35:07] And there there should be such a joy.
[1:35:10] See, happiness happiness just comes and
[1:35:12] goes, right? Good days and bad days, but
[1:35:14] there's a joy that is inside. The joy of
[1:35:17] my salvation, as David says, the joy of
[1:35:20] the salvation that the Lord he that when
[1:35:22] he gives it to you when you're truly
[1:35:24] saved. You know, I I I think brother Ram
[1:35:26] says, you know, we kind of believe a
[1:35:27] little bit like those fundamentalists
[1:35:28] once saved always says. He goes, "Yeah,
[1:35:30] I kind of believe that way." He goes,
[1:35:31] "We just disagree on what the definition
[1:35:33] of saved is." But when God comes in and
[1:35:36] does the saving, he can never unsave
[1:35:39] you.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And there's nobody that can take that
[1:35:42] away from you. And and maybe that's just
[1:35:44] basic preaching. I don't know who needs
[1:35:45] to hear that, but that's the truth this
[1:35:46] morning.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; That devil that comes and tells you,
[1:35:50] "Oh, you did this and you did that and
[1:35:52] maybe you weren't." You can tell that
[1:35:53] devil he's a liar. Take him right back
[1:35:55] to the word. Take him right back to this
[1:35:57] Bible. It's written right in this Bible.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Take him right back to it. And And you
[1:36:02] watch. He can't. He He He doesn't know
[1:36:03] what to do with that. He doesn't know
[1:36:05] how to combat the word
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; when it's wielded by somebody who has
[1:36:11] gotten a revelation of what God has done
[1:36:13] for them.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just stand to our feet. I I
[1:36:18] I I think that's been uh I've taken
[1:36:20] enough of your time. You forgive I
[1:36:21] actually didn't keep track of the time,
[1:36:22] but uh little Josiah, if you want to
[1:36:25] come and
[1:36:32] God bless you this morning. I I pray
[1:36:34] that out of some just absolutely broken
[1:36:37] mess of words that something was that
[1:36:40] the Lord spoke to you this morning by
[1:36:42] even just even just a word from him.
[1:36:45] Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; You can forget the rest of the words,
[1:36:48] but just a just one word from him.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; One word from him is life.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Filter through all the hundreds of words
[1:36:57] that were just said and find that word
[1:36:59] of God that's for you. Amen. Thank you,
[1:37:01] brother.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just worship the Lord a little bit
[1:37:12] before we close the service. There's no
[1:37:14] service this evening. Um, and brother
[1:37:16] Lyall, if you want to come up to get
[1:37:18] ready to close in prayer. Let's worship
[1:37:19] the Lord a little bit.
[1:37:27] Let's just sing because he lives I can
[1:37:31] face tomorrow.
[1:37:34] Key of F.
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:38] God sent his son.
[1:37:43] They called him Jesus.
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:50] He came to love,
[1:37:54] [Music]
[1:37:56] heal, and forgive.
[1:38:02] He bled and died.
[1:38:08] to buy my pardon.
[1:38:15] An empty grave
[1:38:18] is there to prove my Savior
[1:38:24] lives.
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:28] Because he lives,
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:34] I can face tomorrow
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:41] because
[1:38:43] he lives.
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:48] All fear is gone
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:38:54] because I know
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:01] he holds the future
[1:39:07] and life is worth the living
[1:39:13] just because
[1:39:16] he lives. lives.
[1:39:18] And then one day,
[1:39:21] And then one day
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:27] I'll cross that river.
[1:39:34] I'll fight. Life's fine
[1:39:40] over
[1:39:42] with pain.
[1:39:47] And then as death
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:53] gives way to victory.
[1:39:59] I'll see the light
[1:40:03] of glory and I'll know he reigns.
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:12] Oh, because
[1:40:14] he lives.
[1:40:18] I can face tomorrow
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:25] because
[1:40:27] he lives.
[1:40:32] All fear is gone
[1:40:38] because
[1:40:40] I know
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:45] he holds the future
[1:40:49] [Music]
[1:40:51] and life is worth the living.
[1:40:57] just because
[1:40:59] he lived.
[1:41:03] Ly, if you'd close the prayer
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; because he lives,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; he lives in us.
[1:41:16] He lives in us by his grace, by his
[1:41:18] mercy, by his love, by his forgiveness.
[1:41:21] Because like that senician woman, we're
[1:41:24] nothing. But if we recognize who he is
[1:41:29] and that he has chosen to dwell in our
[1:41:32] hearts, we have to make room for him.
[1:41:35] And the only way we can make enough room
[1:41:37] for him is to have no room left for
[1:41:40] ourselves.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:41:44] Lord, we're so grateful for your word
[1:41:47] this morning, Lord, speaking to our
[1:41:49] hearts, Lord, helping us to understand
[1:41:51] our relationship with you. Helping us to
[1:41:54] understand we ways that we can detect
[1:41:57] when that relationship is just off a
[1:41:59] little bit, Lord. Lord, we don't want to
[1:42:02] be married to sin, Lord. We want to be
[1:42:05] married to you. We don't want to be
[1:42:07] wicked and adulterous, but Lord, we want
[1:42:09] to be wholesome and holy yours. Lord, we
[1:42:13] pray that you'd be with us today as we
[1:42:15] go to the places that you've called us,
[1:42:17] Lord, and that you would help us to
[1:42:19] always remember that we're part of you,
[1:42:21] that we're part of one body of Jesus
[1:42:23] Christ. We're part of this fellowship,
[1:42:26] we're part of each other, Lord. We just
[1:42:28] look forward to the times when we can
[1:42:30] gather together again, Lord, and see
[1:42:32] how's my brother doing? How's my sister
[1:42:34] doing? How's this going, Lord? Just each
[1:42:38] thing, Lord. We're so grateful. We're so
[1:42:41] thankful, Lord. We're so in awe of you.
[1:42:45] And Lord, it's all because you live. We
[1:42:48] can live because we have your life
[1:42:51] living within us. Be with us now, Lord,
[1:42:54] we ask. Forgive us every way that we
[1:42:56] fall short. And Lord, help us to draw
[1:42:58] ever closer to you. We thank you in
[1:43:01] Jesus precious name. Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Before we're
[1:43:07] dismissed, we're going to sing My
[1:43:08] Troubled Soul. Brother Tim should be in
[1:43:11] the the list from this morning. You
[1:43:14] could put verse one.
[1:43:18] My troubled soul,
[1:43:22] why so weighed down?
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:27] You weren't meant
[1:43:30] to bear this heavy load.
[1:43:35] Cast all your burdens
[1:43:40] upon the Lord
[1:43:44] cuz Jesus cares.
[1:43:48] He cares for you.

[1:43:57] He cares for you.
[1:44:01] and all your worrying
[1:44:04] won't help you make it through.

[1:44:20] in the promise of his love.
[1:44:26] And I will praise

[1:44:31] name

[1:44:50] salvation.
[1:44:54] My days are in his faithful hands. My
[1:44:59] anxious heart, my anxious heart.
[1:45:05] Why so upset
[1:45:09] in troubled times? How you so easily
[1:45:14] forget
[1:45:17] to cast all your burdens
[1:45:22] upon the Lord.
[1:45:26] Cuz Jesus cares.
[1:45:30] He cares for you.
[1:45:34] Jesus cares.
[1:45:38] He cares for you.
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:42] And all your worrying won't help you
[1:45:46] make it through.

[1:46:42] the mighty
[1:46:44] name
[1:46:46] of Jesus.

[1:48:03] such a wonderful baby shower yesterday.

[1:48:13] It's amazing. Thank you so much for
[1:48:15] everyone who did everything. Appreciate
[1:48:17] you all so much.
[1:48:21] Amen.
[1:48:24] As I said earlier, there's no service
[1:48:25] this evening. Um, if you want to stay
[1:48:27] and pray at your seat, you can stay. But
[1:48:30] for now, God bless you. You're
[1:48:33] dismissed.
