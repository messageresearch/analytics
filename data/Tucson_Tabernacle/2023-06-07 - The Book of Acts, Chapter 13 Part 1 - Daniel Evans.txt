[33:43] Lord Jesus
[33:46] the Lord is open this Bible and
[33:50] I read this account of your Apostles
[33:53] father I pray that the spirit that was
[33:56] on them would anoint us
[33:59] and father I know that this is a
[34:01] different day
[34:03] but Lord you are the same God
[34:06] there are attributes Lord that you have
[34:09] that have been from the beginning and
[34:11] there until now
[34:13] Lord we pray that that those attributes
[34:16] father would be manifested
[34:19] within us within our church
[34:22] and Lord that you would give us wisdom
[34:24] to understand this word
[34:26] and father may your Holy Spirit
[34:29] abide in our hearts and in our lives in
[34:32] Jesus name
[34:35] may God bless you all you can be seated
[34:41] I am
[34:43] appreciated communion service
[34:46] on Saturday or on Sunday it was um wow
[34:50] it's such a blessing I love seeing
[34:52] everybody everyone come up and and
[34:55] really really blesses me to see families
[34:57] up here and see all the families from
[35:00] the moms and the dads all the way to the
[35:03] young ones taking communion
[35:06] um
[35:07] it's what they did in the book of Acts
[35:09] and we are following along in those same
[35:12] principles and and I pray that the Lord
[35:15] will pour out his blessings just like he
[35:17] did in that book
[35:19] we um for the Lyle
[35:22] sister Heather
[35:23] brother Ed
[35:25] brother Jeremy sister Angela and I went
[35:28] over to Sister Green's house for the
[35:30] Perry Green's wife
[35:32] and took communion with her
[35:34] on Sunday after service
[35:37] she uh from what I heard
[35:40] she's getting pretty low
[35:43] but from what I saw
[35:45] she seemed like she was doing pretty
[35:47] good
[35:48] she still had her smile on her face and
[35:52] and I thought that she enjoyed it and I
[35:54] know we all certainly enjoyed being with
[35:57] her it was a great blessing
[35:59] we um we take communion
[36:03] we don't take communion by ourselves
[36:05] that was one of the questions that I
[36:07] used to get over and over and over
[36:09] is
[36:10] can I take communion by myself
[36:14] and my answer was always well is there
[36:18] another church can you not get to a
[36:20] church in the end and the response
[36:23] was always
[36:26] um well yeah but I don't believe like
[36:28] them or they don't believe like us
[36:31] and always putting us in there like I'm
[36:34] involved in that us
[36:36] and uh no brother or sister you take
[36:39] communion with other Saints other
[36:42] Christians it's it's an ordinance of God
[36:45] and no communion is not to be taken by
[36:48] yourself
[36:49] it's not that misses the whole purpose
[36:51] of it
[36:53] we have a Minister's meeting this
[36:56] Saturday
[36:57] and I got to tell you I really
[36:58] appreciate the efforts that uh brother
[37:01] Caleb Duran brother Steve Robson and
[37:05] we're going to be at brother Aaron
[37:07] McGarry's Church up in Phoenix I really
[37:09] so so appreciate that reaching out the
[37:14] right hand of Fellowship and inviting
[37:17] Unity
[37:18] among among the the ministers and I pray
[37:22] that that Unity brother and I pray that
[37:24] it spreads to the congregations
[37:27] I am
[37:28] I think that we have gone just we've
[37:31] gone too far and uh
[37:33] I have to say but there and I wasn't
[37:35] real fond of your testimony that you
[37:37] just gave about that was it you that met
[37:39] that sister
[37:42] you know
[37:44] and I'm sure brother Aaron was kind and
[37:46] he paraphrased it
[37:48] but um
[37:50] to have an attitude
[37:53] like that
[37:55] that it's my way and we're the right
[37:59] ones and if you don't believe it like me
[38:02] then then you're somehow off or you're
[38:05] you're somehow less than we are or or
[38:08] you're somehow not in our little Club of
[38:12] Believers here Brendan that is a
[38:14] brothers and sisters that is a false
[38:17] Doctrine
[38:19] you can trace that Doctrine all the way
[38:21] back as I preached on Sunday you can
[38:25] trace that Doctrine all the way back to
[38:28] murmuring in the wilderness and how Paul
[38:31] said these are our examples is those
[38:35] people and all the mistakes that they
[38:37] made in the wilderness we can take those
[38:39] examples and we can apply them to
[38:41] ourselves here and that is one of the
[38:44] examples one of the mistakes that they
[38:47] made is they fought and they murmured
[38:51] against Moses they murmured against
[38:52] Aaron they murmured against each other
[38:54] they complained and it frustrated God to
[38:59] no end
[39:00] to the point where they they fell into
[39:02] sin and God said I'm just going to wipe
[39:04] the whole thing clean and you see the
[39:06] spirit of Christ in Moses say no Lord
[39:08] no no have mercy
[39:11] and I see it I see it today and brother
[39:13] Aaron when you were when you were saying
[39:14] that let's uh
[39:16] I didn't it made me think of this
[39:19] scripture First Corinthians chapter 1.
[39:25] listen to this
[39:28] chapter 1 verse 12 the Apostle Paul who
[39:31] I'm going to be talking about tonight he
[39:33] says this he says now this I say that
[39:36] every one of you saith I am of Paul
[39:39] and I am of Apollos and I have cephas
[39:42] and I have Christ then Paul asked this
[39:45] question is Christ divided
[39:50] was Paul crucified for you
[39:54] or were you baptized in the name of Paul
[39:56] he's talking to the ones that were
[39:57] saying oh we're Paul
[40:00] and he's rebuking them and then he says
[40:03] it again later on in his letter I
[40:05] believe it's in chapter three
[40:07] yeah right here chapter 3 verse verse 4
[40:10] he says this while one saith I am a Paul
[40:13] not a verse let's start with verse three
[40:16] chapter three verse 3.
[40:18] for ye are yet carnal
[40:21] for whereas there is among you envying
[40:24] and strife and divisions
[40:25] are ye not carnal and walk as men
[40:29] for a while one saith I am of Paul and
[40:33] another I am of Apollos are you not
[40:36] carnal
[40:38] the same thing
[40:40] as as as you experienced it's the same
[40:43] thing now and I am sick of it
[40:48] I just it makes it makes me sick it just
[40:51] even dealing with it this week
[40:54] it just gets it makes my skin crawl
[40:57] saying can you not read the scriptures
[41:01] and if you don't believe the scriptures
[41:03] can you not listen to brother Branham
[41:05] you claim oh we believe brother Branham
[41:07] he did not teach that
[41:09] how hard is it to just believe it you
[41:12] say you believe every word you say it's
[41:13] infallible then do what it says
[41:19] verse number 22 even
[41:21] he whether Paul 3 22 whether Paul or
[41:25] Apollos or cephas or the world or life
[41:28] or death are things present or things to
[41:30] come all are yours
[41:33] and your Christ
[41:35] and Christ is God's
[41:37] oh
[41:38] amen you know I
[41:41] I look at that
[41:45] let me I'll level with you okay I always
[41:48] love it with you oh yeah everybody
[41:50] sometimes my loved ones say well you say
[41:54] too much
[41:56] that's why I am at this church
[41:59] is because this church is is a place
[42:02] that I came and I brother Aaron I didn't
[42:04] feel that spirit
[42:07] I didn't feel that we're better than you
[42:12] and let me tell you it was it was
[42:14] attractive to me
[42:16] it was something that there was an
[42:18] attraction brother Brown preached that
[42:20] message what is the attraction on the
[42:22] mountain it was God on the mountain
[42:25] and it was something to me I thought
[42:28] those people
[42:31] are not like that
[42:34] and it
[42:37] I mean I'm here it brought me here and I
[42:41] just and I just loved it I didn't feel
[42:44] that spirit
[42:45] and I pray it never it is never here I
[42:49] always want to reach out that that right
[42:51] hand of Fellowship
[42:53] and even uh brother Lyle at you and and
[42:56] brother Arnie and me going up there and
[42:58] representing this Congregation of
[43:01] believers
[43:03] representing all of us and saying no
[43:06] brothers we love you
[43:09] and we're not gonna boycott we're not
[43:11] going to stay away we are going to come
[43:13] we're going to make an effort to drive
[43:15] all the way up there just so we can
[43:17] shake your hand just so we can be with
[43:19] you
[43:20] and that's the spirit we need in the
[43:22] churches and I believe that is what the
[43:24] Apostle taught here and and we are going
[43:27] to see as we move into this book of Acts
[43:29] now we are going to see that infighting
[43:33] and those problems start to arise among
[43:38] the people and we'll see maybe tie them
[43:41] in in the future tie them in with other
[43:43] books other
[43:45] um
[43:46] Epistles that the apostles wrote and
[43:49] maybe say okay here in the book of Acts
[43:51] this is happening well here's what's
[43:52] written in this epistle
[43:55] and tie them in I'll do that if the
[43:58] Lord's willing a little bit tonight
[44:02] um
[44:04] but the enemy wants to divide us
[44:08] and he knows that if we're together
[44:12] in the bonds of love
[44:15] that he is broken and he has lost the
[44:18] battle
[44:19] if we can just stay that way love one
[44:22] another don't put each other down
[44:25] pick each other up
[44:27] that's how we should be as a church
[44:29] always welcoming people in and and I was
[44:33] as I was trying to say on Sunday that if
[44:35] you see a visitor in our midst there
[44:38] should be a line waiting to shake that
[44:41] person's hand I don't care what they
[44:43] look like
[44:45] and I'll tell you what I believe that we
[44:47] have a church that has that attitude
[44:49] sometimes you just have to as Elijah as
[44:54] the Bible says about Elijah he had to
[44:55] gird up his loins and and and just just
[44:58] do it to really just make an effort if
[45:03] you are shy it's okay overcome the
[45:06] shyness
[45:07] and go and greet people and love them
[45:09] and uh also you can get into their
[45:12] business a little bit
[45:14] say brother sister is there anything I
[45:16] can do for you ask them try to try to
[45:19] get a feeling about how they are and and
[45:22] then you might as I said on Sunday you
[45:24] might find that they need someone
[45:27] my son's been witnessing
[45:30] to uh
[45:31] to another young man he's older than
[45:34] Daniel he's got a house like 30
[45:35] something he's got a family where his
[45:37] father-in-law's sick and he's just
[45:39] really really struggling with it and
[45:42] Daniel's been witnessing to him and
[45:44] encouraging him and now he can't wait to
[45:46] see Daniel because he knows that if he
[45:49] sees that young man he is going to get
[45:51] lifted up and that he seeks them out and
[45:54] then there's there's other ones that are
[45:56] doing the same with it's at a gym or at
[46:00] a work or wherever it is they when you
[46:03] walk into the room they should smile
[46:06] and they said oh they should say oh I
[46:08] just I love it when sister Shirley comes
[46:10] in sister Shirley I saw you here you
[46:13] were the first one here I peeked out the
[46:15] door and saw you there praying and I it
[46:17] just lifted me up and I was a little bit
[46:20] down and I see sister Shirley there
[46:22] praise the Lord sister Shirley loves the
[46:24] Lord she loves me she loves this
[46:27] congregation I know that that sister
[46:29] prays for me brother Aaron I know she
[46:31] does and it just it makes me feel good
[46:33] just to see you
[46:35] I it and I just all of you everybody
[46:37] here
[46:38] I know every single one of you and
[46:42] we should we should just not take each
[46:44] other for granted
[46:46] I better get I better get to my subject
[46:49] did you just say yes
[46:52] do you hear sister Shirley
[46:57] I forgive you
[47:00] I'm gonna practice what I preach
[47:04] acts Acts chapter 13.
[47:07] it's a tough crowd
[47:10] Acts chapter 12 it ends it ends with
[47:13] this it said
[47:15] but the word of God grew and multiplied
[47:18] and Barnabas and Saul returned from
[47:20] Jerusalem so they came from Jerusalem
[47:22] back to Antioch when they had fulfilled
[47:24] their Ministry and took with them John
[47:27] whose surname was Mark
[47:30] Chapter 13 Verse 1.
[47:33] now there were in the church that was
[47:36] that Antioch certain prophets and
[47:37] teachers as Barnabas
[47:40] and Simeon that was called Niger and
[47:43] Lucius of Cyrene and Maine
[47:47] which had been brought up with Herod the
[47:50] tetrack
[47:51] now once again I want to spend just a
[47:55] few minutes on who these these men are
[47:58] in this first verse
[48:01] it's uh this man Barnabas we've we
[48:03] remember him he's a popular character in
[48:06] the book of Acts to this point acts 11
[48:09] 24 says he is a good man and full of the
[48:12] Holy Ghost and the faith he's the one
[48:14] who donated he sold land in Cyprus which
[48:17] we're going to hear about right now he
[48:18] sold land in Cyprus and he gave the full
[48:21] proceeds of that property to the
[48:24] disciples
[48:26] he also stood up for Saul of Tarsus when
[48:29] the Christians
[48:30] they couldn't believe he was converted
[48:33] so this man Barnabas had a good
[48:36] reputation he was it was a very very
[48:38] good man
[48:39] then the next one is Simeon called Niger
[48:43] that word Niger it means black
[48:47] so we don't know where this man is from
[48:49] but we can assume that he's an African
[48:53] and there are some Scholars I think as I
[48:57] was
[48:57] brother Lyle you probably read this too
[49:00] but as I was studying this and I was
[49:02] reading the different takes on who these
[49:05] people were there are some Scholars that
[49:08] think that this Simeon is actually Simon
[49:12] the siren
[49:13] who carried Jesus's cross
[49:16] whether he is or he isn't I don't know
[49:19] but
[49:20] I pray that one day I'll be able to
[49:23] shake his hand and ask him
[49:26] then the next one is Lucius of Cyrene
[49:30] and like these other brothers he was one
[49:33] of the founders of the church here at AF
[49:35] of Antioch and he was probably another
[49:37] African
[49:39] acts 11 verse 19.
[49:44] referring back to this Lucius
[49:47] it says this acts 11 19 it says now they
[49:51] they which were scattered abroad upon
[49:53] the persecution that arose about Stephen
[49:55] traveled as far as fenishi and Cyprus
[49:59] and Antioch preaching the word to none
[50:02] other but the Jews only
[50:04] and some of them were men of Cyprus and
[50:07] Cyrene
[50:09] which when they were come to Antioch
[50:11] spake unto the grecians preaching the
[50:14] Lord Jesus so this is this man Lucius
[50:17] this is almost surely this one that was
[50:21] spoken of in Acts 11 being a siren and
[50:24] he was probably among those Jews who
[50:29] were speaking to these Greek these
[50:31] greek-speaking Jews back in Acts 11.
[50:34] and then
[50:36] there's this man named Maine the the the
[50:40] last one there
[50:42] and the verse the the verse says that he
[50:45] was brought up with Herod the tetrarch
[50:48] now remember from remembering brother
[50:50] Lyle's sermon last week that Herod the
[50:53] tetrarch and Herod Antipas are the same
[50:56] person
[50:57] um
[50:58] and
[51:00] The Gospel According to Lyle
[51:03] um
[51:04] and I did a lot of research too places
[51:06] the birth of Herod the tetraarch about
[51:09] 20 BC
[51:12] so if you look in your Scofield bible in
[51:16] Acts 13
[51:18] you'll see at the top
[51:20] that there is a date and that's 45 A.D
[51:24] now these aren't exact dates these are
[51:26] just the best guests but they're they're
[51:28] they're probably really close
[51:31] so if you look if he was born according
[51:33] to brother Lyle and and also the
[51:36] research that I I did to back you up
[51:39] 20 years plus 45 years this man
[51:44] an was about 65 years old
[51:48] and possibly older than that
[51:50] so
[51:52] we see that he's he's an older fellow I
[51:56] mean he's not as old as brother Lyle but
[51:58] he he's he's he's older fellow
[52:02] you can laugh
[52:04] [Laughter]
[52:06] brother loud picks on me too
[52:09] um
[52:10] but you could see that that even some of
[52:13] the more aged people are preaching the
[52:15] gospel now this man meaning
[52:18] it's it's really neat because it says
[52:20] that he grew up
[52:22] with this Herod Antipas
[52:26] Herod
[52:27] Antipas was
[52:30] not a great guy
[52:32] if I remember right if I have my history
[52:34] right he married his his brother's wife
[52:39] and then his brother's wife he had a
[52:43] thing for his brother's wife's daughter
[52:45] and she danced for him and then he had
[52:48] John the Baptist head cut off
[52:50] and uh
[52:52] killing John the Baptist and coming in
[52:54] against the Christians all they did he
[52:56] was really a creepy guy
[52:58] just not not the best person that around
[53:02] but this man
[53:04] an
[53:06] grew up with him and look at the
[53:08] Divergent
[53:10] ways of their lives you see Antipas over
[53:14] here just following
[53:17] sin in his life and then you see this
[53:20] man over here serving God giving his
[53:23] heart accepting Jesus Christ two very
[53:27] very different people here
[53:30] and uh I also want to point out the
[53:33] diversity of this group of four that it
[53:37] looks like they were
[53:39] instrumental in founding this this
[53:41] church at Antioch
[53:43] there you have
[53:46] in Maine and you have a Jew
[53:49] probably from Jerusalem
[53:51] and Paul
[53:53] you have a Jew
[53:55] that was actually from outside of Israel
[54:00] gree is speaking Greek growing up among
[54:04] the Romans then you have
[54:06] this these two siren probably
[54:11] black Brothers
[54:13] all of them working together
[54:16] to preach the gospel that's the book of
[54:18] Acts just absolutely
[54:21] no separation at all working together
[54:25] for the furtherance of the Gospel
[54:28] now this chapter it starts chapter 13 it
[54:32] starts in Antioch
[54:34] and it ends in Antioch
[54:36] but they're two different places
[54:39] they have the same name
[54:41] starts in Antioch which is the Antioch
[54:43] in Syria and then it ends up at the end
[54:47] of the chapter which we won't get to
[54:49] today but we'll we'll get there
[54:51] eventually it ends up in southern turkey
[54:56] so two different cities with the same
[54:58] name but
[55:00] um they uh two very very different
[55:02] places verse number two
[55:06] as they minister to the Lord and fasted
[55:08] the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas
[55:11] and Saul for the work where unto I have
[55:14] called them
[55:16] and now
[55:18] again look at the dedication of the
[55:20] church
[55:21] as they ministered to the Lord how can
[55:24] you minister to the Lord
[55:27] that's a good question huh
[55:29] how can you Minister well the word
[55:32] minister is not necessarily preaching
[55:34] some translations say serving others say
[55:37] worshiping so they were praising they
[55:40] were fasting they were serving they were
[55:43] worshiping and then the Holy Spirit
[55:46] spoke how did the Holy Spirit speak
[55:50] it always speaks through a human being's
[55:52] voice almost always
[55:54] so they were they were consecrating
[55:57] their lives of the Lord they were
[55:58] praying they were fasting they were
[56:00] right with the Lord they were they were
[56:02] in unity and then whether somebody may
[56:05] have given a prophecy someone may have
[56:07] spoken in tongues I don't know how
[56:09] exactly it came but the Holy Spirit here
[56:13] said
[56:14] and it it most likely came through a
[56:17] human being just like it always always
[56:19] does
[56:21] separate me Barnabas and Saul for the
[56:23] work where until I have called them
[56:25] the bottom line here is God was speaking
[56:28] through the people
[56:30] just as he does
[56:31] as always does and he does now
[56:34] Barnabas is a Jew from Cyprus so it
[56:37] makes sense that he and Saul are headed
[56:40] there for this missionary trip
[56:44] and and when they had fasted and prayed
[56:47] they laid their hands on them and they
[56:50] sent them away
[56:53] now the theme of the book of Acts is the
[56:56] acts of the Holy Spirit working in these
[57:00] Apostles and I think brother Lyle and I
[57:03] mention it whenever we're teaching on
[57:04] this we probably mention it every sermon
[57:07] and it's good dimension
[57:09] that these are human beings
[57:11] these are very flawed human beings these
[57:15] are human beings that have opinions
[57:17] these are human beings that make
[57:18] mistakes and you're going to see some of
[57:20] these mistakes they make mistakes but
[57:23] yet they are filled with the Holy Spirit
[57:25] and they are working exactly in line
[57:28] with what God wants them to do
[57:33] and I think it's
[57:36] it's really beautiful to me to see that
[57:39] that God
[57:42] is
[57:43] sending these people out
[57:46] to preach the gospel
[57:48] and you think
[57:50] well why doesn't God just go to this I'm
[57:55] going to speak about this this governor
[57:58] here in a couple verses why doesn't he
[58:00] just go to him directly or why didn't
[58:03] God
[58:05] just go to Cornelius directly and
[58:07] introduce Christ
[58:10] why does does why doesn't God just do it
[58:13] send an angel and do it himself
[58:15] sometimes he sends an angel but that
[58:18] angel will introduce a believer
[58:21] and then that believer will bring the
[58:23] message
[58:24] and it's because the way that God does
[58:27] things is he sees he wants his people
[58:29] working together
[58:31] he wants them leaning on each other and
[58:34] helping each other and that's that's why
[58:36] it's but they're in that that
[58:38] story just bothers me so much because
[58:41] that's not love
[58:44] that's just getting someone to believe
[58:46] like you believe
[58:47] and we're going to see here how that it
[58:50] fails
[58:53] verse number four
[58:56] so they being sent forth by the Holy
[58:58] Ghost departed unto solution and from
[59:01] thence they sailed to Cyprus
[59:06] and when they were at Solomon's they
[59:09] preached the word of God in the
[59:11] synagogues of the Jews and they had also
[59:14] John to their Minister now there are
[59:17] obviously a lot of Jews in this area of
[59:19] Cyprus because it says plural it says
[59:22] synagogues and I want you to note this
[59:25] man that was with them
[59:27] John it's also called John Mark
[59:30] and it says John was their Minister but
[59:34] that word minister in this sense it
[59:36] means helper or assistant someone that
[59:39] that
[59:41] basically does things for them that
[59:43] assists them
[59:46] and when they had gone through the aisle
[59:48] into paphos
[59:50] they found a certain sorcerer a false
[59:52] prophet a Jew
[59:54] whose name was bar Jesus
[59:58] do you know what bar Jesus means
[1:00:03] brother Lyle said it means son of Jesus
[1:00:06] remember Simon barjona talking about
[1:00:09] Peter
[1:00:10] Simon son of Jonah
[1:00:12] this
[1:00:14] man is bar Jesus now I don't think I
[1:00:17] don't see anywhere that Jesus was
[1:00:18] actually a common name back then so I
[1:00:22] don't think that this man had anything
[1:00:23] to do with Jesus Christ that was just
[1:00:26] the name that that he was given
[1:00:31] um
[1:00:32] and uh
[1:00:34] it's it's really strange too because
[1:00:36] sorcery was strictly forbidden in the
[1:00:39] Jewish religion and it was punishable I
[1:00:42] think by death I think about Saul uh
[1:00:45] King Saul and The Witch of Endor and
[1:00:48] that story and and how that that these
[1:00:52] Sorcerers Through the Bible and witches
[1:00:54] they it was it was death penalty you
[1:00:57] didn't practice this stuff but we see
[1:01:00] that this man barred Jesus was a Jew
[1:01:04] and a false prophet
[1:01:07] so he had mixed Judaism probably with
[1:01:11] local beliefs of idolatry and and Paul
[1:01:15] is going to encounter Through the Ages
[1:01:18] through the his missionary trips all
[1:01:19] kinds of idolatry and heathenism and and
[1:01:23] all these things are going to rise up
[1:01:24] and It also says that as I said it says
[1:01:28] that this man is a false prophet
[1:01:31] so he's someone that's Leading the
[1:01:34] People astray for his own game
[1:01:40] then
[1:01:43] let me let me uh read that one again and
[1:01:45] when they had gone through the aisle
[1:01:47] papers they found a certain Sorcerer of
[1:01:49] false prophet a Jew whose name was bar
[1:01:51] Jesus which was with the deputy of the
[1:01:54] country Serge's paulus a prudent man who
[1:01:57] had called for Barnabas and Saul and
[1:01:59] desired to hear the word of God
[1:02:01] now sergius paulus was a governor or of
[1:02:05] the leader of Cyprus assumed somehow
[1:02:07] appointed by Rome
[1:02:09] and uh there was something special about
[1:02:12] this governor and that he was seeking
[1:02:14] the truth he wanted to know he had heard
[1:02:18] maybe about this Christianity and he
[1:02:20] wanted to know more but we see this
[1:02:23] false prophet
[1:02:24] this barred Jesus we see him sneak in
[1:02:29] and try to prevent
[1:02:32] this governor
[1:02:34] from hearing the gospel
[1:02:37] and that's a spirit
[1:02:39] that isn't just back then
[1:02:42] but it's a spirit that is so prevalent
[1:02:45] today
[1:02:47] we see that
[1:02:48] that so often that you'll you'll see
[1:02:51] some
[1:02:52] young people dating and one will be of
[1:02:54] this religion and one bill that religion
[1:02:57] there'll be one that has Zeal and then
[1:02:59] the one might have a family that that
[1:03:01] they've never gone to church or anything
[1:03:03] but they were born Baptist or Catholic
[1:03:05] or whatever and then they see their sons
[1:03:07] start to date this this Holiness
[1:03:10] Holiness girl and then all of a sudden
[1:03:14] they are Catholic and they're starting
[1:03:16] to go to mass and they're starting to go
[1:03:18] to church and they all of a sudden find
[1:03:20] religion when they see that that their
[1:03:23] son or their daughter might be dating
[1:03:26] someone that's not part of their
[1:03:27] religion
[1:03:28] it's hypocrisy and we see here that this
[1:03:33] bar Jesus he's doing the same thing
[1:03:36] he's saying wait wait wait don't don't
[1:03:38] listen to what these people say and he
[1:03:40] does everything he can to hinder it
[1:03:45] but elements the sorcerer for so is his
[1:03:49] name by interpretation withstood them
[1:03:51] seeking to turn away the deputy from the
[1:03:53] faith
[1:03:54] then Saul who is also called Paul
[1:03:58] filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes
[1:04:01] on him now this is the first time
[1:04:04] Saul of Tarsus is called Paul
[1:04:08] and it's it's really it's really neat
[1:04:11] that the timing of it and it's probably
[1:04:15] not the first time that he was ever
[1:04:17] called this name Saul of Tarsus
[1:04:20] was of The Tribe of Benjamin which was
[1:04:23] also King Saul
[1:04:25] way back when remember the first king of
[1:04:28] Israel so the king the first king of
[1:04:31] Israel was named Saul so we can maybe
[1:04:35] guess that Saul of Tarsus being also of
[1:04:39] The Tribe of Benjamin may have been
[1:04:41] named after King Saul
[1:04:44] we don't know that but
[1:04:46] that's the first one we know with that
[1:04:49] name
[1:04:49] Saul my point in saying that is Saul is
[1:04:53] a Hebrew name
[1:04:55] so Paul is a Latin name or a Roman name
[1:05:00] so I assume that he grew up in in this
[1:05:03] Saul of Tarsus went to school with
[1:05:05] Hebrews he studied in Jerusalem he was a
[1:05:08] very Pious legalized legalistic man he's
[1:05:11] probably always went by his Hebrew name
[1:05:14] Saul but then
[1:05:17] he as he is moving into this work with
[1:05:20] the Gentiles
[1:05:22] God changes his heart as you know from
[1:05:26] earlier and also
[1:05:28] changed his name to his Latin or his
[1:05:32] Roman name Paul
[1:05:34] so he's probably given both names just
[1:05:37] after his birth but now we see him
[1:05:39] changing to a messenger to the Gentiles
[1:05:42] and then taking on that Gentile name of
[1:05:45] Paul
[1:05:46] an overview
[1:05:48] of how God prepares a man
[1:05:51] for the job
[1:05:53] you know we've heard so many times that
[1:05:55] God doesn't call the qualified he
[1:05:58] qualifies the called
[1:06:00] this man Paul was born for this work
[1:06:07] he you can see as as his as his life
[1:06:11] goes on
[1:06:13] and the experiences that happened to him
[1:06:16] he had Jewish Bloodlines all the way
[1:06:18] back to the Tribe of Benjamin
[1:06:22] and he was Roman by birth because his
[1:06:25] dad had purchased his purchased his own
[1:06:29] Freedom so the dad purchased his freedom
[1:06:32] and then
[1:06:34] Paul was born after the dad had
[1:06:37] purchased his freedom so Paul was free
[1:06:40] because his dad was a Roman citizen now
[1:06:42] so Paul being born to his dad even
[1:06:45] though they were Jews born to his dad
[1:06:47] who had purchased his Roman citizenship
[1:06:49] now Paul was born free
[1:06:52] it would be like an immigrant coming to
[1:06:54] the United States that if their parents
[1:06:58] come here
[1:07:00] and then that child is born here they're
[1:07:03] citizen
[1:07:04] so on this one it was Paul that Paul's
[1:07:07] dad had purchased
[1:07:09] his Roman citizenship with a great
[1:07:12] amount of money probably
[1:07:13] and then because he had done that when
[1:07:16] Paul was born he was born a Roman
[1:07:19] citizen which had to have made things a
[1:07:22] lot easier in his missionary Journeys
[1:07:25] that he's about to embark on
[1:07:27] and he's Greek culturally
[1:07:32] so he was born meaning he was he was one
[1:07:34] of these Greek speaking Jews probably
[1:07:36] born outside of Israel raised out
[1:07:38] outside of Israel in the city of Tarsus
[1:07:41] and he was raised in the Jewish faith in
[1:07:44] his home and eventually studying Judaism
[1:07:46] under under in Jerusalem under the most
[1:07:49] respected of all the teachers gamalia
[1:07:53] and then by a miracle so we see that he
[1:07:56] was
[1:07:57] he was by his bloodline he's Jew he was
[1:07:59] born Roman he was educated as a Jew and
[1:08:03] then we see by a supernatural experience
[1:08:07] he became a Christian
[1:08:09] so look at all of these things working
[1:08:11] up
[1:08:12] to to building this character in this
[1:08:15] ability of Paul to preach the gospel
[1:08:17] remember what I preached on Sunday
[1:08:19] is that
[1:08:21] I asked for strength
[1:08:23] and then God gave me trials
[1:08:26] I asked for love and then God gave me
[1:08:28] all these people to love I asked for
[1:08:31] this and and he gave me something that
[1:08:33] that didn't necessarily match up with
[1:08:36] what I thought it was going to be but it
[1:08:37] was exactly what I needed when I asked
[1:08:39] for it and that's here we have the
[1:08:41] Apostle Paul a man that has been
[1:08:44] prepared for this job
[1:08:46] and then he's also spent three years
[1:08:48] studying the scriptures and tracing
[1:08:50] Christ back from Genesis all the way to
[1:08:53] that day
[1:08:56] Let's uh let's go to the next verse
[1:09:00] verse number 10.
[1:09:11] go back to verse number nine then Saul
[1:09:14] who is also called Paul filled with the
[1:09:16] Holy Ghost set his eyes on him speaking
[1:09:19] to this sorcerer
[1:09:21] and said oath full of all subtlety and
[1:09:24] Mischief thou child of the devil thou
[1:09:27] enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not
[1:09:30] cease to pervert the right ways of the
[1:09:32] Lord again the biggest problem with this
[1:09:35] bar Jesus was not that he was he was a
[1:09:38] hypocritical Jew or he was even a
[1:09:40] sorcerer but the biggest problem with
[1:09:42] bar Jesus was that he was trying to
[1:09:44] prevent someone from coming to Christ
[1:09:46] and we see it
[1:09:49] today all over the place
[1:09:51] we see the Seventh-day Adventist saying
[1:09:54] well you have to worship on Saturday
[1:09:55] that that should be the Sabbath or
[1:09:57] you're out we see the book of we see the
[1:09:59] Mormons saying you have to accept the
[1:10:01] Book of Mormon or you're out we see the
[1:10:03] Jehovah Witnesses saying that Christ
[1:10:05] can't be divine or deity because that
[1:10:07] makes more than one God and over and
[1:10:09] over and over and I'm sure all of us
[1:10:11] have dealt with it ourselves
[1:10:14] and now behold this is again Paul
[1:10:17] speaking and now behold the hand of the
[1:10:19] Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be
[1:10:21] blind not seeing the Sun for a season
[1:10:23] and immediately there fell on him a mist
[1:10:26] and a darkness and he went about seeking
[1:10:29] some to lead him by the hand
[1:10:33] does that sound familiar
[1:10:37] exactly
[1:10:39] it sounds like exactly what happened to
[1:10:41] Paul
[1:10:43] Paul was he was fighting against the
[1:10:46] Lord
[1:10:47] the Lord struck him down somebody had to
[1:10:50] lead him
[1:10:52] now one thing I really appreciate about
[1:10:54] this let me read that verse again verse
[1:10:56] number 11.
[1:10:58] and now behold the hand of the Lord is
[1:11:00] upon thee and thou shalt be blind not
[1:11:03] seeing the son for a season
[1:11:07] and immediately there fell on him a mist
[1:11:09] and a darkness and he went about seeking
[1:11:11] some to lead him by the hand
[1:11:15] he said brother Lyle for a season
[1:11:19] and I think
[1:11:22] even the Lord
[1:11:24] left it open for this man
[1:11:28] to come the same way that Paul did
[1:11:32] dy I don't know I hope he did
[1:11:35] God's the judge whether he did or he
[1:11:38] didn't I don't know but he said for a
[1:11:41] season so he probably received his sight
[1:11:45] later on
[1:11:48] we don't know we don't we don't know
[1:11:49] what happens to this this man but I do I
[1:11:52] do appreciate that that the door is open
[1:11:55] a little bit he didn't drop dead the
[1:11:57] door is open for repentance there
[1:12:00] then the deputy
[1:12:01] when he saw what was done believed being
[1:12:05] astonished at the doctrine of the Lord
[1:12:09] so
[1:12:10] even with this
[1:12:12] this opposition
[1:12:15] the Lord uses the opposition of this
[1:12:18] this evil person
[1:12:21] to show this Deputy the glory of God and
[1:12:27] I want to show right there do you see
[1:12:30] we've seen it from Acts chapter 2 all
[1:12:33] the way till now do you see how
[1:12:34] important Miracles are
[1:12:37] the signs of God
[1:12:39] these great things that happened
[1:12:41] this miracle right here that happened
[1:12:45] smiting this man blind is probably the
[1:12:48] reason that this Deputy saw that okay
[1:12:52] this is something there's something to
[1:12:53] this
[1:12:54] this isn't just someone's preaching a
[1:12:57] new doctrine there's actually power
[1:12:59] behind what he is saying and that should
[1:13:03] be us
[1:13:05] as we're as
[1:13:07] whoever's in the Pulpit we're preaching
[1:13:09] the gospel whoever's out witnessing
[1:13:10] whoever's just living a life there
[1:13:12] should be a power behind that testimony
[1:13:16] they should be a power behind that
[1:13:18] sermon there should be these signs that
[1:13:22] come from God they should be with us
[1:13:27] and we I believe that we should see more
[1:13:31] of them
[1:13:32] and I'm praying Lord
[1:13:35] I don't want to be a hypocrite
[1:13:37] I preach about I preach about miracles I
[1:13:40] preach about signs I preach about
[1:13:42] tongues I preach about prophecy I
[1:13:44] support those things now Lord I lay it
[1:13:48] at your feet
[1:13:50] and I say like Gideon does Lord if God
[1:13:54] be with us and where are all the
[1:13:55] Miracles
[1:13:57] I know that we have someone we don't
[1:13:59] want to Discount what God does for us
[1:14:01] but we also look in this book of Acts
[1:14:05] and these people were converted because
[1:14:07] they saw the supernatural signs of God
[1:14:10] happen
[1:14:12] I'll read that again then when the
[1:14:13] deputy then the deputy when he saw what
[1:14:16] was done believed being astonished at
[1:14:20] the doctrine of the Lord
[1:14:22] now when Paul and his company loose from
[1:14:24] Papas they came to perga and pamphilia
[1:14:27] and John departing from them returned to
[1:14:32] Jerusalem
[1:14:33] this is a big deal right here it doesn't
[1:14:37] sound like a big deal does it
[1:14:38] it is
[1:14:41] so much is going on in this book of Acts
[1:14:45] and I thank God that the author recorded
[1:14:48] these seemingly Little Things
[1:14:51] John John Mark is a cousin cousin of
[1:14:55] Barnabas and it seems like I think it's
[1:14:58] a cousin or nephew he's he's related to
[1:15:00] Barnabas somehow and it seems like he
[1:15:02] was a great help to the team so the team
[1:15:05] arrives to pamphilia and John Mark says
[1:15:08] I'm out of here
[1:15:09] I'm leaving
[1:15:11] why would he do that
[1:15:14] we don't I don't have an answer for it
[1:15:17] but he could have he could have got sick
[1:15:19] he could have um
[1:15:22] he could have wanted to go back home he
[1:15:24] could have had to go back to work he
[1:15:26] could have been a myriad of things or
[1:15:30] it could have been some sort of a
[1:15:32] contention
[1:15:34] between him
[1:15:37] and Paul
[1:15:38] maybe it doesn't seem like Barnabas and
[1:15:41] Paul
[1:15:42] but there was some sort of a contention
[1:15:44] that that happened right there and some
[1:15:49] sort of a problem that happens right
[1:15:50] there and then John Mark goes home
[1:15:54] now
[1:15:56] let's turn
[1:15:58] a couple Pages a couple uh pages to the
[1:16:02] right
[1:16:03] and go to um
[1:16:05] Acts chapter 15.
[1:16:07] verse 36.
[1:16:11] now this the First Missionary trips over
[1:16:14] great things were accomplished great
[1:16:16] things happened and then they're
[1:16:18] planning the second missionary trip
[1:16:22] all right so we jumped into the future a
[1:16:23] little ways acts 15 36 says this and
[1:16:27] some days after Paul said unto Barnabas
[1:16:29] let us go again and visit our brethren
[1:16:31] in every city where we have preached the
[1:16:34] word of the Lord and see how they do and
[1:16:36] Barnabas determined to take with them
[1:16:38] John whose surname was Mark
[1:16:41] same guy
[1:16:43] the servant
[1:16:45] but Paul thought not good to take him
[1:16:49] with them who departed from them in
[1:16:52] pamphilia
[1:16:53] and went not with them to the work
[1:16:56] and the contention was so sharp between
[1:16:58] them that they departed asunder one from
[1:17:01] another so Barnabas took Mark and sailed
[1:17:04] to Cyprus and Paul chose Silas and
[1:17:07] departed being recommended by the
[1:17:09] Brethren unto the grace of God
[1:17:12] now that word departed I was I was
[1:17:16] looking at the different translations of
[1:17:18] it it's different
[1:17:20] than the first time it's used in Chapter
[1:17:22] 13 Departed
[1:17:24] this time it's used and it's basically
[1:17:27] it says the amplifier Amplified Bible
[1:17:30] says this the one who had quit and
[1:17:33] deserted them in pamphilia and not gone
[1:17:36] on with them to the work
[1:17:39] most other translations says deserted
[1:17:41] them
[1:17:43] so we see
[1:17:45] that
[1:17:46] there was some sort of an issue there
[1:17:49] and we know that from listening to tapes
[1:17:52] we know that that Barnabas isn't even
[1:17:56] mentioned really again after this
[1:18:00] so
[1:18:01] Paul goes his way and Barnabas I'm sure
[1:18:04] Barnabas was a man of God and and and
[1:18:07] doing doing the things of God but his
[1:18:11] time in the book of Acts is over now
[1:18:14] so let's go back to Chapter 13 Verse 14.
[1:18:19] and when they departed from perga they
[1:18:22] came to Antioch in pasidia and went into
[1:18:26] the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat
[1:18:28] down
[1:18:29] and after reading of the law and of the
[1:18:31] prophets the rulers of the synagogue
[1:18:33] sent unto them saying ye men and
[1:18:36] Brethren if ye have any word of
[1:18:37] exhortation for the people say on so
[1:18:41] here Barnabas and Paul so they're
[1:18:44] visiting ministers
[1:18:46] to the church they're visiting rabbis
[1:18:50] to the church and and so we we see we
[1:18:53] see this even today that that different
[1:18:55] Brothers will come to different churches
[1:18:56] and and they'll preach and we see it all
[1:18:58] the way back here in the book of Acts
[1:19:02] and we see that that Paul
[1:19:07] hear
[1:19:09] is about to give his first public sermon
[1:19:15] and we know that he's spoken a little
[1:19:18] bit here and there but this is the first
[1:19:20] recorded sermon that Paul gives and uh
[1:19:25] I might just get started in a little bit
[1:19:29] but let's uh if the musicians will come
[1:19:31] forward let's let's put it off brother
[1:19:33] Lyle um
[1:19:35] I'll pray about it and uh maybe I'll
[1:19:38] come back to it Sunday morning
[1:19:40] or maybe Sunday night can you just can
[1:19:43] you be on standby for chapter 14. okay
[1:19:46] thank you
[1:19:47] so
[1:19:49] so we see that Paul
[1:19:52] is now he's stepping forward and you see
[1:19:56] that now Paul is taking some leadership
[1:19:59] here and Barnabas is maybe stepping back
[1:20:03] into the background so Paul raises his
[1:20:06] hand and says listen
[1:20:08] listen to me
[1:20:10] he stands up
[1:20:12] beckons with his hand and says men of
[1:20:15] Israel
[1:20:16] and ye that fear God give audience
[1:20:19] the God of this people of Israel chose
[1:20:23] our fathers and exalted the people when
[1:20:25] they dwelt as strangers in the land of
[1:20:27] Egypt and with a high arm brought them
[1:20:30] out of it so if you'll notice in the
[1:20:32] book of Acts you see Peter preach
[1:20:35] then you see Stephen preach and now
[1:20:38] you're seeing Paul preach
[1:20:41] and brothers and sisters it's the same
[1:20:44] sermon
[1:20:46] they say very very similar things
[1:20:51] starts with a history of how that that
[1:20:55] God has done all these great things and
[1:20:58] brought them to this time and then
[1:21:02] it goes to
[1:21:04] about how that that those old times now
[1:21:08] they they were talking about this man
[1:21:10] Jesus
[1:21:12] and then it goes into a call
[1:21:16] for the people to believe and usually
[1:21:20] it's he hits them
[1:21:22] pretty hard and he says he says your
[1:21:24] families your ancestors are the ones
[1:21:27] that did this
[1:21:29] and we see that that Paul
[1:21:33] in uh in doing this he's holding strong
[1:21:36] to that same way of ministering
[1:21:40] and um
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:43] I'll stop I'll stop there
[1:21:47] as far as this book of Acts but I do
[1:21:51] want to say in
[1:21:52] and we're all family and friends here
[1:21:54] that
[1:21:55] [Music]
[1:21:57] every sermon
[1:22:00] that's in the book of Acts
[1:22:02] every sermon that's in the New Testament
[1:22:08] that's past the gospels and and that
[1:22:10] that is is preached every single one
[1:22:13] points to one thing
[1:22:15] and it's the Christ
[1:22:17] and it's it's without exception they're
[1:22:20] preaching the same thing
[1:22:23] they're pointing people to Christ
[1:22:26] and that's how I believe that that's how
[1:22:28] our sermon should be we may start in
[1:22:31] Genesis we may start in Isaiah we may
[1:22:34] start in Revelation but wherever we we
[1:22:37] start from we should end up in Christ
[1:22:42] every sermon should
[1:22:45] you believe that
[1:22:47] God bless you I appreciate you coming
[1:22:49] out tonight
[1:22:50] I am I know sometimes Wednesday is
[1:22:54] is a hard time but this book of Acts is
[1:22:58] friends it's just wonderful
[1:23:01] it's it's a tremendous example of what
[1:23:05] can happen to normal people when they
[1:23:08] just believe do you believe let's stand
[1:23:12] foreign
[1:23:15] [Music]
[1:23:20] the Lord's willing I don't know if I'll
[1:23:23] uh
[1:23:24] I'm gonna pray about it the remainder of
[1:23:26] the week I might
[1:23:29] preach on Paul's sermon
[1:23:31] on Sunday morning I do have some things
[1:23:35] in my heart I'd like to talk about
[1:23:39] my son
[1:23:41] and uh
[1:23:43] and I we lost a
[1:23:48] somebody we knew in Jeffersonville
[1:23:52] we had that Ministry and uh
[1:23:56] with the boxing gym
[1:23:59] well it was basically built
[1:24:01] on four
[1:24:04] young men
[1:24:07] it was my son
[1:24:09] it was my two nephews
[1:24:11] and a professional heavyweight fighter
[1:24:15] well he died tragically
[1:24:19] a couple days ago
[1:24:21] and I don't know really don't know why I
[1:24:24] died in his sleep
[1:24:26] but um I'd like to talk a little bit
[1:24:29] about that this Sunday
[1:24:32] and I believe the Lord laid Something in
[1:24:34] My Heart
[1:24:35] about how that we shouldn't neglect to
[1:24:39] preach this gospel
[1:24:41] gospel none of us should Wherever You
[1:24:43] Are
[1:24:44] we shouldn't neglect to tell people
[1:24:45] about the Lord Jesus because you don't
[1:24:47] know that you may be talking to somebody
[1:24:49] that might be their last day on Earth
[1:24:53] friends God bless you all I pray that
[1:24:55] that some of the book of Acts chapter 13
[1:24:59] would stay with you tonight think about
[1:25:02] these four men that went to that went to
[1:25:05] Antioch and
[1:25:07] and and started this work and then going
[1:25:10] and traveling and and how that John Mark
[1:25:13] he
[1:25:14] something happened there and there was
[1:25:17] there was a split in the division and
[1:25:19] and we see this this sorcerer this
[1:25:23] magician come in and he tries to keep
[1:25:26] the word away from from the leader there
[1:25:31] and um I think we can see it all today's
[1:25:34] world
[1:25:35] God bless you all over there
[1:25:39] foreign
