[34:02] one more time
[34:08] [Music]
[34:17] last time
[34:21] [Music]
[34:32] prawn
[34:34] [Music]
[34:46] exchanged
[34:52] tell me when we're ready okay uh god
[34:55] bless you all
[34:56] thank you for giving me a moment to tell
[34:58] my testimony
[35:00] last sunday we were at home i was
[35:02] streaming the kids were still a little
[35:04] bit sick so thank you all for
[35:05] praying for them they're doing fine just
[35:07] taking a long time to get over it
[35:09] um but my dad said you know does anyone
[35:12] want to testify and i was so sad that i
[35:14] wasn't here i was like yeah i want to
[35:15] testify
[35:16] so here i am and the whole service was
[35:18] about faith and
[35:20] you know your confession and all that so
[35:22] it's just like kind of still
[35:23] in my heart that i wanted to do this so
[35:25] last year
[35:26] covet hit obviously lockdown came we
[35:29] were really isolated
[35:30] me being isolated with my thoughts is
[35:32] not a great idea
[35:34] but i was also on a medication that the
[35:36] side effects were nervousness and
[35:38] anxiety
[35:39] and i kind of battled anxiety a good
[35:41] portion of my life
[35:42] i felt like the lord had delivered me
[35:44] before um
[35:45] but because it was a side effect of the
[35:47] medication i kind of was just like oh
[35:49] it's a side effect it's fine and i let
[35:51] it back in
[35:52] so it came in and it took hold and it
[35:56] just like bound me overwhelm me
[35:59] and when i would get um
[36:02] anxious or nervous whatever i would you
[36:04] know sometimes go out for a jog or a
[36:06] walk and that always seemed to work
[36:07] clear my mind
[36:08] one day i went out and i came back and
[36:10] it was even worse and i remember telling
[36:12] amos
[36:13] i feel like i'm losing my mind and it
[36:15] was just so overwhelming
[36:18] well i um was listening to a message and
[36:22] uh it was and i wrote down the date and
[36:24] the message obviously um it was april
[36:26] 22nd
[36:27] it was late at night the kids had gone
[36:28] to bed and
[36:30] it was the angel in his commission
[36:32] preached in
[36:33] 1950 and a lot of the early services are
[36:37] about faith and there's a lot of like
[36:38] prayer lines and healing
[36:40] and stuff and at the end of one of the
[36:42] services
[36:43] um brother branham says this he says now
[36:45] just shake yourself a little bit
[36:47] pinch your inside part wake up what more
[36:49] could god do for you
[36:50] or what more could god do what more
[36:52] could he do he couldn't
[36:54] heal you against your faith no more than
[36:56] nothing he could he
[36:57] and if you do believe him you're healed
[36:59] anyhow and that struck me
[37:01] and i realized the only thing keeping
[37:03] from my healing was myself
[37:05] and so it hit my heart and at the end i
[37:08] believe he had the people stand up
[37:10] and say this prayer so i did i stood up
[37:12] and i said this prayer and it says
[37:14] lord god i now commit myself to you so
[37:16] help me god from this time on
[37:18] i'm going to testify of my healing
[37:19] regardless of what takes place
[37:22] and so i also so i had to pray for a
[37:24] little bit of grace
[37:25] because i know myself and how i like to
[37:28] doubt but i was like okay from now to
[37:30] eternity
[37:31] this is my confession so things changed
[37:34] for me my mind cleared
[37:37] you know if you know what anxiety and
[37:39] depression and nervousness
[37:40] feel like you know what that feels like
[37:42] but if you don't that's a really big
[37:43] blessing because
[37:44] it's so overwhelming yes so
[37:48] my mind cleared and like my mom could
[37:49] tell a difference she's like i can tell
[37:51] you know you're different and every time
[37:53] satan would try and give it back to me i
[37:54] would just
[37:55] rebuke him and stand on the word and
[37:57] remind him and sometimes just try and
[37:59] ignore it
[38:00] and just you know i was happy it was i
[38:02] forget that people were struggling we
[38:04] were in the middle of a pandemic because
[38:06] i was doing great the lord had touched
[38:08] me
[38:09] so come the end of the year i i like new
[38:11] year's i like to look back
[38:12] on what has happened and what i want to
[38:14] go for for the next year
[38:16] and i realized what a great like
[38:18] blessing amidst of all the struggle that
[38:20] i had
[38:20] received because i had been healed so i
[38:23] posted my testimony on facebook trying
[38:24] to you know be a better witness and to
[38:26] testify what the lord has done for me
[38:28] so i posted it and i was kind of like
[38:30] put a target on my back
[38:32] and satan said okay let's see if she
[38:34] really believes this
[38:36] so he came a little harder and i would
[38:38] just rebuke him stand on the word keep
[38:39] going
[38:40] and uh like two weeks ago i think it was
[38:43] two and a half weeks ago when brother
[38:44] glover was here
[38:45] i was here at that evening service and
[38:47] if you're here was just so powerful
[38:49] like you could feel the presence of the
[38:50] lord so strong
[38:52] and i think it was the next day
[38:54] elizabeth text us in a group chat saying
[38:56] you know
[38:56] she had been reading how brother branham
[38:59] said that next
[39:00] 72 hours the lord has done something for
[39:02] you sane's going to come after you
[39:04] so she's like let you know let's claim
[39:05] our victory and
[39:07] she was right that was the worst week
[39:11] i felt like i was beaten around i felt
[39:14] like the anxiety and nervousness and
[39:17] like before
[39:18] i call it oppressive overthinking
[39:19] because i'd lay down at night and it was
[39:21] just my mind would go and go and go
[39:23] and i couldn't sleep you know so those
[39:26] things
[39:26] started coming back and i would rebuke
[39:29] him satan
[39:30] and throw the word at him and just keep
[39:32] claiming the verses
[39:33] doing the things you should do to stand
[39:35] on the word of god and
[39:37] i kind of felt like i was drowning i
[39:39] felt like i was under six feet of mud
[39:41] standing on the word
[39:43] you know just overwhelmed
[39:47] so i'd like to think at the end of the
[39:49] week i was victorious and
[39:50] you know i gained ground not that the
[39:52] lord had to rescue me instead i don't i
[39:54] don't know
[39:55] but the next week it eased up and it
[39:57] still was there a little bit but i kept
[39:59] revoking it
[40:00] and standing on the word a little bit of
[40:03] a
[40:03] testimony in that week i was thinking
[40:05] you know i should text nina
[40:07] she um when i'm struggling she's the one
[40:10] i can text because she knows what i'm
[40:11] going through and she'll pray for me
[40:13] and i pulled out my phone right after
[40:15] that and she had texted me asking me
[40:17] will you pray for me i'm going through
[40:19] something so i kind of laughed and we
[40:20] prayed for each other and
[40:21] the burden eased for both of us after we
[40:24] prayed so that was really nice
[40:26] so the next week it eased up and my mind
[40:29] was a little bit clearer and i just kept
[40:31] reviewing satan and claiming the word
[40:34] come to this week my mind was clear
[40:36] again it's like this is
[40:37] what that like clarity of mine feels
[40:39] like this is fantastic
[40:41] so i just wanted to take this
[40:44] opportunity
[40:44] to testify what the lord has done for me
[40:48] and to remind satan that the blood of
[40:51] the lord jesus christ
[40:53] has healed me
[40:58] i am free from anxiety from nervousness
[41:02] like that oppressive overthinking and
[41:06] he can never ever take that away from me
[41:29] this is
[41:35] [Music]
[41:46] this
[41:48] i'm gonna let it shine let it
[41:51] shine let it shine
[42:03] [Music]
[42:12] don't let satan blow
[42:16] i'm gonna let it shine let it
[42:19] shine let it shine let it shine
[42:26] let it
[42:29] i'm shine let it shine
[42:32] let it shine till jesus comes
[42:36] i'm gonna let it shine
[42:39] let it shine till jesus comes
[42:42] i'm gonna let it shine let it
[42:46] shine let it shine let it
[42:49] shine this little light
[42:52] this little light of mine
[42:56] and i'm gonna
[42:59] [Music]
[43:10] i'm gonna let it shine let it
[43:13] shine let it shine let it
[43:16] shine
[43:24] brother jeremy could you come up pray
[43:26] for the prayer request we have one
[43:27] prayer request tonight
[43:29] from sister shirley she said uh
[43:33] please pray for mercy zomborono's niece
[43:36] betty for salvation and healing of her
[43:38] kidneys
[43:39] also sister mercy would like a touch
[43:41] from god to
[43:42] help her with her balance let's let's
[43:45] all stand
[43:51] god bless you all i was listening to the
[43:54] tape leadership
[43:56] today and brother branham said this
[43:58] little
[43:59] one-liner and he said the holy ghost
[44:02] only feeds on the word
[44:08] and um when you listen to tapes
[44:12] the holy ghost only magnifies
[44:15] himself so
[44:19] i encourage you to listen to tapes i
[44:22] encourage you to pray
[44:24] because the bible says god answers
[44:27] prayer it's not so much that we talk
[44:31] to one another but he answers prayer
[44:37] just like sister abby's testimony we got
[44:40] together and we prayed
[44:43] things settled down
[44:46] it was great you know god's on time
[44:52] comes in the power of your need
[44:55] we just like to bow our heads and
[44:58] take this need to the lord
[45:04] [Music]
[45:06] great heavenly father we just we love
[45:09] you
[45:12] we're ordained to love you
[45:16] and it's it's so wonderful
[45:20] to see like precious faith on display
[45:25] lord it's it's really hard to get up
[45:27] here and
[45:28] talk in front of good peers
[45:33] they're all christians
[45:35] [Music]
[45:36] and it's it's hard to magnify that
[45:40] but lord we we want to lord we should be
[45:48] able to come to one another and confess
[45:50] our faults
[45:52] not not everyone's gonna
[45:56] pray for us but lord if we have maybe
[46:00] one friend
[46:03] just going through something you know
[46:06] sometimes we don't have to speak it
[46:08] because you already know it we just have
[46:12] to
[46:12] say that it's unspoken it's within our
[46:16] heart
[46:17] and lord you look on our hearts
[46:21] and we grow lord if we're not
[46:26] it's so so good to absorb what you
[46:30] you give us to eat lord but we'd love
[46:34] love to bear fruit of it
[46:39] just don't let us all be here suddenly
[46:41] but to ours
[46:44] lord because we're your light
[46:47] that you shine through us
[46:51] and we just give you glory we give you
[46:53] honor we give you praise
[46:56] and we shall overcome by the blood of
[46:59] the lamb
[47:02] we just pray that this request
[47:06] lord that you'll meet it
[47:11] because it's your will to heal
[47:16] it's your will to deliver
[47:20] and your will to of uplift
[47:26] and we're so grateful
[47:30] we ask you to bless brother aaron as he
[47:34] ministers your word lord represents the
[47:37] light
[47:39] in this darkness hour and lord we
[47:43] represent the light too lord you should
[47:46] find a bonfire here
[47:47] tonight yes one that
[47:51] unchews evil
[47:55] and talks about the light
[47:59] we just love you lord we appreciate your
[48:02] goodness to us

[50:45] the only way you could reach him is when
[50:46] you're perfect
[50:48] because you would never get to him but
[50:51] he's provided a way and he said if
[50:52] you'll just
[50:53] come through that provided way just
[50:55] believe
[50:56] you can touch him amen let's bow our
[50:58] hands

[52:23] and wondered is there another part to
[52:24] this
[52:26] or did we go in a different direction
[52:28] and god knew there was another part to
[52:30] this so
[52:33] you may be seated
[52:37] just a couple of announcements
[52:41] spoke to brother isaiah chisholm today
[52:43] and he was up in
[52:45] cottonwood yesterday ministering for
[52:47] brother
[52:49] chris long and then tonight for brother
[52:50] dale smith up in flagstaff but
[52:53] he said to greet you folks and that he
[52:56] enjoyed himself
[52:58] the presence of the lord the atmosphere
[53:01] everything was just so wonderful
[53:04] and he had sent a text to brother matt
[53:06] kind of saying the same thing and i
[53:08] spoke to brother matt for a few moments
[53:09] today and
[53:11] he said brother isaiah just kind of
[53:12] repeated those things it was just a
[53:14] pleasure to be
[53:15] here with you so i appreciated him
[53:19] coming and sharing his heart and
[53:22] i said so when are you going home he
[53:24] says i'm going home wednesday and i
[53:26] i've got a call already to go minister
[53:28] at a church on sunday
[53:31] and i said you're 60 years old but you
[53:33] act like you're 18.
[53:34] you know but the joy of the lord is your
[53:37] strength
[53:38] when there is a light when there is
[53:40] something in it can it constrains you it
[53:43] makes you even though maybe you're
[53:44] sitting there and saying i'm tired i'm
[53:46] worn out
[53:47] but something inside of me says you know
[53:50] and i appreciate that so
[53:53] also um there's a young couple here
[53:56] today
[53:57] and um they're they're going to have 50
[54:01] years married this weekend
[54:03] i don't know the exact date what day is
[54:05] it
[54:07] the 13th lyle and sister heather
[54:11] 50 years married
[54:18] i didn't speak to sister heather about
[54:21] it but brother lyle
[54:23] and he made a comment he said she has a
[54:25] blind spot
[54:27] for me she doesn't look at anything else
[54:30] wrong she just looks at me with a and he
[54:32] called it a blind spot
[54:34] and i'm reminded i was reminded when
[54:37] when we
[54:39] had our 41st and my wife said i'm going
[54:41] to keep you
[54:42] you're a keeper and i said why she said
[54:45] because i don't want to train another
[54:47] one
[54:48] so my question was so i'm trained
[54:52] she gave me a funny look then but you
[54:55] know god has been good to us
[54:57] you know he saw this from eternity
[55:01] he didn't say it would be smooth sailing
[55:04] all the time
[55:05] but he said there is an end an expected
[55:09] end and i appreciate the goodness of the
[55:12] lord in the grace of god so
[55:15] as i was looking and saying lord
[55:19] in in this we started with why fear
[55:23] when you realize that god has met every
[55:26] one of the requirements every need it's
[55:28] things that he's provided
[55:29] why fear there's no reason to be afraid
[55:33] there's no reason
[55:34] to start thinking how is it going to
[55:35] work but we're humans and we do
[55:39] and we question it i i really appreciate
[55:42] when brother matt says
[55:43] here and here god knows it all alpha and
[55:47] omega but we're in the
[55:48] middle here and that's the hard part but
[55:51] you
[55:51] look and you see god has it under
[55:53] control god has it in his hands
[55:56] and and um
[55:59] what else to us seems like forever is
[56:02] but a moment in god's time
[56:04] and one of these days we'll step into
[56:06] that time and we'll realize brother
[56:08] brahm says you'll travel like a thought
[56:10] you know and the things that we don't
[56:12] comprehend right now
[56:14] we've seen a few things we've gotten to
[56:17] taste some
[56:18] uh those that have shared experiences of
[56:21] goddess
[56:22] so we know it's real i can testify i
[56:26] know it's real
[56:27] god has done things but in this flesh
[56:30] you can't live in that atmosphere all
[56:31] the time
[56:33] but soon and very soon there's going to
[56:35] be a body change
[56:37] and that's our desire that's our or what
[56:40] we long for
[56:42] but as as i was looking and i was
[56:44] reading something and and
[56:46] this this made me realize there was
[56:48] another part to this and that is
[56:50] we have a part to play in this
[56:51] redemption
[56:54] you know there's something that we are
[56:55] to do something that we are because
[56:56] we're the body of jesus
[56:58] christ you know and and
[57:02] let me just say it this way the the head
[57:05] is
[57:05] is what controls the body but the body
[57:07] has to go out and do it
[57:10] my head tells me get up and go
[57:13] and my feet say uh i'm still tired i
[57:16] haven't you know
[57:17] there's a response there's a but but
[57:19] when the body is working like it's
[57:21] supposed to it's an amazing
[57:23] thing that god has done but when things
[57:25] go wrong
[57:26] and we heard testimony today of of
[57:29] things that that can go wrong
[57:31] but god is still god
[57:35] and it also makes us appreciate
[57:39] when we go through something and god
[57:42] delivers everyone realize
[57:44] how much god loves us makes us
[57:47] appreciate
[57:48] it also makes us look at somebody else's
[57:50] suffering and have compassion on that
[57:52] one
[57:53] and ask for god's mercy so i want to
[57:56] read a few quotes here
[57:59] and um it's there's i think three or
[58:01] four maybe five of them
[58:03] we're going to read those and then we're
[58:05] going to get into some scriptures here
[58:09] and we'll start with redemption in
[58:11] completeness
[58:12] in joy says
[58:15] i've got kind of like a fleece before
[58:17] the lord for this meeting
[58:20] and i'm expecting god to do something
[58:23] that will start the meeting a rolling
[58:25] right here in the city i'm under
[58:26] expectation
[58:28] i just didn't come to the thing and say
[58:30] well i'm under expectation he says i'm
[58:32] expecting something from god
[58:35] and you have to approach god that way
[58:38] lord
[58:38] it's your word you keep your word and
[58:41] i'm expecting that
[58:43] you don't come in self-righteousness you
[58:45] don't approach and say i deserve it
[58:49] you say god i'm taking you at your word
[58:51] and that pleases him
[58:53] look at this roman centurion a roman
[58:56] century not even
[58:57] what we would call a believer but he
[59:00] realized
[59:01] god's authority and he said i have
[59:03] authority like this
[59:04] i realize that i say they do so you
[59:07] speak
[59:08] and god said i have not found
[59:12] faith like this you know so he says
[59:18] i am expecting god to do something that
[59:20] will start the media rolling right here
[59:22] in this city
[59:22] you pray do your part
[59:25] and then he says when judgment comes we
[59:27] can all stand and say
[59:29] we did our part
[59:32] so that started kind of the ball rolling
[59:34] here there is a part
[59:36] the body has a part the uniting time and
[59:40] sign
[59:44] oh my no wonder they came where is he
[59:47] where is he that's born king of the jews
[59:50] we've seen his star in the east and have
[59:51] come to worship him where is he
[59:54] they know that that that infant messiah
[59:56] was laying somewhere because god
[59:59] gave them a sign of the time and we know
[1:00:03] god is somewhere because of all that god
[1:00:07] has shown us
[1:00:08] he's the same yesterday but it shouldn't
[1:00:11] be
[1:00:11] where we're having to go look for him
[1:00:14] there should be such an
[1:00:15] experience or relationship now in your
[1:00:17] life that you know where he is
[1:00:19] should be in you should be in me he says
[1:00:22] but here
[1:00:23] he says gave them a sign the timing
[1:00:27] and god and man were uniting together
[1:00:30] what a unity unity when god united
[1:00:33] himself
[1:00:34] in a human body the principle the
[1:00:37] greatest
[1:00:37] of all uniting that was ever done
[1:00:41] when god united with a man and left his
[1:00:44] great strain of being god
[1:00:46] and stretched forth his tent and took in
[1:00:48] humanity
[1:00:49] and became one of them to redeem them
[1:00:52] unity
[1:00:53] that what that brought peace between god
[1:00:56] and man
[1:00:56] forever how thankful we are
[1:01:00] god doing his part
[1:01:03] he had to step down into a body of flesh
[1:01:08] in order to understand us in order to be
[1:01:11] able to be touched by the feeling of our
[1:01:12] infirmities
[1:01:13] in in order to hear the cry when a
[1:01:16] mother
[1:01:17] uh cries out oh lord help me with my
[1:01:19] children
[1:01:21] the bible says he learned by the things
[1:01:24] he suffered
[1:01:25] the you know it's hard to imagine him
[1:01:27] being a teenager
[1:01:29] but he was it's hard to imagine being a
[1:01:32] child running around
[1:01:33] getting in the way but he did he had
[1:01:37] brothers
[1:01:38] there that the bible says he had to
[1:01:40] learn to get along
[1:01:43] that's the only way he would say lord
[1:01:45] help me i'm having trouble with my
[1:01:47] sibling
[1:01:49] and then he could say well it's just
[1:01:52] hard to put him in that level but that's
[1:01:54] what he did
[1:01:58] god's gifts always find their place and
[1:02:01] this was the quote that
[1:02:02] kind of really said it
[1:02:06] mary the mother of jesus in the city of
[1:02:08] nazareth
[1:02:09] the meanest city there was in the land
[1:02:13] but out of there god chose a little lady
[1:02:15] to give birth to his son
[1:02:17] an incubator a womb that had to a baby
[1:02:21] had to be born by he took
[1:02:23] such a person to do it
[1:02:26] god just didn't create out of the sky a
[1:02:28] little baby and put it there
[1:02:30] it went through the same process
[1:02:33] of a natural birth god works through
[1:02:36] human beings to redeem
[1:02:38] human beings he can take you
[1:02:42] work through you to redeem humanity if
[1:02:45] you'll completely dedicate
[1:02:47] everything you are this little light of
[1:02:50] mine
[1:02:51] i'm gonna let it shine i don't know that
[1:02:53] brother matt
[1:02:55] said i know what brother aaron's
[1:02:56] preaching so i must sing that song no
[1:02:58] that's god working things and i was
[1:03:01] enjoying myself back there with
[1:03:03] lord you're you're working this you're
[1:03:04] doing this in simplicity
[1:03:06] he says if you're a young woman
[1:03:10] dedicate your morals if you're a young
[1:03:12] man dedicate your morals
[1:03:13] dedicate your mind dedicate your
[1:03:16] thinking
[1:03:16] dedicate your heart dedicate your soul
[1:03:20] dedicate all you are and let christ
[1:03:23] work through that what a glorious thing
[1:03:27] now it's not you doing the work it's you
[1:03:30] giving yourself over to him
[1:03:32] and letting him do the work you know um
[1:03:35] one of the things that that we teach
[1:03:37] somebody or
[1:03:38] in the shopping house is let the tool do
[1:03:41] the work
[1:03:43] don't force it when you force it it
[1:03:46] causes more trouble
[1:03:48] when you try to get it to do something
[1:03:49] it's let it do the work
[1:03:51] let him do the work in you you yield
[1:03:55] you surrender you say here i am lord
[1:03:58] that
[1:03:59] and it's amazing how that works and then
[1:04:01] you stop and you go why did i struggle
[1:04:03] so much for this
[1:04:04] and then tomorrow you get up in the
[1:04:06] morning hey you got to do it again
[1:04:08] every day every moment you know i was
[1:04:12] reading something from
[1:04:13] the daily strength and talking about
[1:04:16] dedicating yourself
[1:04:17] um you know with uh luther
[1:04:21] with a just shall shall live by faith
[1:04:24] and and wesley for sanctification
[1:04:26] and i was looking at some things that
[1:04:28] brother branham said about
[1:04:29] sanctification
[1:04:30] you're not sanctifying yourself
[1:04:34] you're yielding yourself to let him
[1:04:36] sanctify you
[1:04:38] now there are things that you can do
[1:04:41] to put yourself in a place where he can
[1:04:44] sanctify you
[1:04:46] if you're going to places you shouldn't
[1:04:48] be how is god going to take and do that
[1:04:50] but putting yourself in a place where
[1:04:52] hey lord here i am
[1:04:54] i'll dedicate this hour to that i have
[1:04:57] right now
[1:04:58] to you lord and let him work
[1:05:01] i'll i'll avoid the other things i'll
[1:05:02] turn off all the the the things that are
[1:05:04] about
[1:05:05] i'll give you some time to work in my
[1:05:07] heart lord
[1:05:08] and let him do that it's his work
[1:05:11] you know when we try to sanctify
[1:05:13] ourselves it becomes laws it becomes
[1:05:15] works
[1:05:16] and works and laws really just take you
[1:05:19] to fear
[1:05:20] because all it says is that enough is it
[1:05:22] enough is it enough
[1:05:24] is this good enough or it takes you to
[1:05:26] the other side
[1:05:27] i'm good enough i deserve it both ways
[1:05:31] are wrong
[1:05:31] but if you'll sit with a humble heart
[1:05:33] and he says dedicate yourself to him
[1:05:35] watch what he'll do questions and
[1:05:38] answers
[1:05:40] the next quote there
[1:05:44] and watch watch here what brother braham
[1:05:46] says and then there was another thing
[1:05:48] that was a conversion of omar price down
[1:05:51] there
[1:05:52] that time when he was so critical
[1:05:54] against me and you know he come to the
[1:05:55] tabernacle and was baptized in the name
[1:05:57] of the lord jesus
[1:05:59] oh he fought me so hard on that and i
[1:06:02] stayed with him at nighttime
[1:06:04] i just kept loving him staying right
[1:06:06] there just the same but he finally come
[1:06:09] because the lord told me he was going to
[1:06:11] come so i just stayed
[1:06:13] right there with him
[1:06:17] so i'm asking you this question how do
[1:06:18] you know that person
[1:06:20] is not a child of god because i
[1:06:23] gave him the word test and he didn't
[1:06:26] accept it
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:29] well then somebody else comes and gives
[1:06:31] them a different word test and then
[1:06:32] somebody else comes in
[1:06:34] but what about just loving somebody and
[1:06:36] being a christian in front of them
[1:06:39] what about your life being the word of
[1:06:41] god displayed
[1:06:42] rather than so much our words
[1:06:46] because you get 10 people get up here to
[1:06:48] give the instructions on how to win
[1:06:49] somebody by the word test you're going
[1:06:51] to get 10 different ways to do it
[1:06:53] which one is right but if it's christ in
[1:06:56] you
[1:06:57] the hope of glory then you can give to
[1:06:59] somebody else
[1:07:00] the hope of glory such as i have
[1:07:04] i give unto you in the name of jesus
[1:07:07] christ
[1:07:07] not in the name of peter not in the name
[1:07:10] of john not in the name of william
[1:07:11] branham not in the name of
[1:07:13] tucson tabernacle but in the name of the
[1:07:15] lord jesus christ why
[1:07:17] because he was in them i want to show a
[1:07:20] hands on this how many know they have
[1:07:22] the holy ghost
[1:07:24] so you can do the same thing that peter
[1:07:27] did
[1:07:28] oh but that was for peter he was a
[1:07:30] disciple then who are you
[1:07:33] is god lessened over this time no he's
[1:07:36] still the same
[1:07:37] yesterday today and forever
[1:07:40] he said i just stayed i loved him
[1:07:44] and it made me think how do i know that
[1:07:47] person
[1:07:47] is or is not a child of god i've got to
[1:07:50] treat it like
[1:07:51] every one of them is well he sure
[1:07:53] doesn't look like one
[1:07:55] while he sure or she
[1:07:58] now before the eyes of god all of us
[1:08:02] are filth if we're looking at it this
[1:08:04] way not a righteous
[1:08:06] righteous one at all i don't care how
[1:08:09] you address us what you do
[1:08:10] if you're looking at it that way
[1:08:14] but i believe god has saved me
[1:08:17] has cleansed me has made me so if he can
[1:08:19] do it for me he can do it for somebody
[1:08:21] else
[1:08:22] but who is he going to use
[1:08:26] sometimes when somebody would listen he
[1:08:28] had to use a donkey
[1:08:31] why because the donkey was willing to
[1:08:32] listen and be used
[1:08:35] sometimes we're so hard-headed that and
[1:08:38] we're so s
[1:08:39] stuck in our ways that god says well go
[1:08:42] ahead
[1:08:43] if you're going to be that way go deal
[1:08:44] with it yourself
[1:08:47] the last quote there what was the holy
[1:08:48] ghost give them for
[1:08:52] and in the cool of the evening he would
[1:08:54] come down and commune with him
[1:08:56] and there he lost that fellowship
[1:09:00] because sin would not let him do it and
[1:09:02] then
[1:09:03] he was made flesh and dwelt among us in
[1:09:05] order that he could come back again to
[1:09:07] man
[1:09:08] and live in a man and restore a man to
[1:09:11] the state of communion with him again
[1:09:13] and give him back his god-given right
[1:09:17] it's a god-given right god said it's
[1:09:18] yours it's not an
[1:09:20] earned right it's a god-given right
[1:09:23] that's what he did that's the purpose of
[1:09:26] the holy ghost it's the father again
[1:09:28] god the father dwelling in you working
[1:09:31] out his plans
[1:09:32] to finish his plan of redemption working
[1:09:35] through you
[1:09:35] making you a co-worker with him giving
[1:09:38] you a place
[1:09:39] giving you a part for your fallen lost
[1:09:41] brother and sister
[1:09:43] giving you his spirit and his love to go
[1:09:47] hunt the lost as he did in the garden of
[1:09:49] eden
[1:09:50] adam adam or art thou that's what the
[1:09:53] holy spirit does to a man or a woman
[1:09:55] when it strikes into their heart and it
[1:09:57] takes its abode
[1:09:59] there's a thirst and a hungering for
[1:10:01] lost
[1:10:02] souls amen you look at your neighbor you
[1:10:05] look at your brother you look at your
[1:10:07] sister you look at
[1:10:08] the person walking down the street and
[1:10:10] you say oh that they would have
[1:10:12] this that i have
[1:10:15] it's not it's without money it's without
[1:10:17] price it's not a sales giving
[1:10:19] it's something burning from inside of
[1:10:21] you wanting to be expressed
[1:10:24] that little that little fountain that
[1:10:26] little spring
[1:10:27] brother branham's talking to it and
[1:10:29] saying what is it about that why and he
[1:10:31] said it's just inside of me
[1:10:33] i couldn't stop it if i wanted to stop

[1:10:37] so somebody come by and say come come by
[1:10:39] and say in this midst
[1:10:41] of trouble and trial and what's going on
[1:10:43] how can you

[1:10:48] can't help it it's something inside of
[1:10:50] me well then tell me how to get it tell
[1:10:52] me and that's
[1:10:54] how do you know that isn't a child of
[1:10:55] god and it made me re
[1:10:58] as i was thinking of some of this just
[1:11:00] struck me this way
[1:11:02] brother branham on that boat and says
[1:11:04] little fishy i give you
[1:11:06] back your life
[1:11:10] has god changed is he the same yesterday
[1:11:14] today and forever
[1:11:16] could you then say brother sister
[1:11:18] whatever it is
[1:11:19] i give you life
[1:11:22] you have it in you you can't give it i
[1:11:26] i know that that's real it's happened
[1:11:28] with me there was a and i've shared it
[1:11:29] with a uh
[1:11:30] i don't remember how old she was my
[1:11:31] little young girl playing in the back
[1:11:33] here
[1:11:34] and something happened to her and sister
[1:11:36] carolyn miles and sister saundra came
[1:11:38] running up with her and and sister
[1:11:40] carolyn had her
[1:11:41] kind of holding her like this and kind
[1:11:44] of folded over
[1:11:46] with in her head's back like this and
[1:11:48] her eyes had rolled back and she was
[1:11:49] just white and she said brother aaron
[1:11:51] and i looked at it and i said little
[1:11:53] sister
[1:11:54] in the name of jesus christ i give you
[1:11:56] back your life
[1:11:58] instantly i didn't stop to consecrate
[1:12:00] myself or anything just
[1:12:02] and her head came straight back up her
[1:12:04] eyes rolled over and she said put me
[1:12:06] down and she took off ronnie
[1:12:10] it had it works you know
[1:12:13] i i don't know what stage she was in
[1:12:15] that's all i saw
[1:12:17] it's still the same yesterday today and
[1:12:19] forever
[1:12:20] and and then you know when brother
[1:12:22] braham says little fishy i give you back
[1:12:24] your life
[1:12:25] and and there was five times of the
[1:12:27] spoken word why because brother branham
[1:12:29] was special
[1:12:30] sure he was called and god was jesus but
[1:12:32] he was a man
[1:12:34] just like you and me and a man who
[1:12:37] accepted it
[1:12:38] and lived with it you hear when he is
[1:12:41] speaking
[1:12:42] you can hear both sides he's he's
[1:12:44] talking about himself and
[1:12:45] and sometimes he's he's making himself
[1:12:47] so low i'm no good i'm nothing
[1:12:49] and there's other times he's standing
[1:12:51] and he's saying i know
[1:12:52] where i'm standing i know who's here
[1:12:54] with me and i take every spirit under my
[1:12:56] control
[1:12:59] and if we're not careful we let every
[1:13:00] spirit take under control of us
[1:13:03] but we can we have that same god
[1:13:08] he's sitting there and he's squirrel
[1:13:10] hunting
[1:13:11] and that voice speaks to him what are
[1:13:13] you here for
[1:13:16] what are you here for and brother
[1:13:18] branham speaks those squirrels into
[1:13:20] existence
[1:13:22] it works god is the same
[1:13:25] yesterday today and forever now what
[1:13:28] brother branham doesn't tell
[1:13:29] that story is he consecrated himself for
[1:13:31] five years alone in the monastery to get
[1:13:33] that no
[1:13:35] he was out hunting that morning
[1:13:38] and god looked at his heart and said
[1:13:39] what would you desire well i'm hunting
[1:13:43] it happened to me al cuntin almost three
[1:13:45] and a half years ago
[1:13:47] i had shot at one and missed missed
[1:13:49] twice
[1:13:52] and i was sitting there and sitting down
[1:13:55] on the ground there and and
[1:13:57] at first i was quite disappointed
[1:13:59] because
[1:14:00] i'm probably not going to get another
[1:14:01] shot and then i just began to thank the
[1:14:04] lord
[1:14:04] that i'd even got a chance to see one
[1:14:06] and shoot at one
[1:14:07] there were those that weren't even going
[1:14:09] to see an elk
[1:14:11] and that voice that has spoken to me
[1:14:12] before said
[1:14:15] what are you here for and my answer was
[1:14:18] that was for brother branham that's
[1:14:21] exactly how i answered it
[1:14:23] and then again he asked what are you
[1:14:26] here for
[1:14:28] took about four times before i realized
[1:14:30] he's asking me what i'm here for
[1:14:32] i can speak what i want
[1:14:36] sitting there i looked up on the hill i
[1:14:38] said i want the elk to come from there
[1:14:40] come down this trail come right down the
[1:14:43] middle and go right through here
[1:14:46] and i just said thank you lord i stayed
[1:14:48] sitting there
[1:14:49] my boss was with me he was using the
[1:14:51] binoculars and i look up
[1:14:53] right where i pointed i saw the body of
[1:14:56] two elk i could not see their heads
[1:14:58] they were behind the trees his name is
[1:15:00] jim i said jim up there and he gets the
[1:15:01] binoculars and he goes don't shoot the
[1:15:03] first one shoot this
[1:15:04] the don't shoot the second one shoot the
[1:15:05] verse or don't i'm sorry don't shoot the
[1:15:07] first one
[1:15:08] shoot the second one i said i've got a
[1:15:09] heart shot on the first one and a gut
[1:15:11] shot on the thing when he goes
[1:15:12] i'll wait till it moves and that's when
[1:15:14] the six by six stepped
[1:15:15] out and i exactly where i had pointed
[1:15:18] shot him that's where he fell
[1:15:20] but the other elk ran down that trail
[1:15:23] came right down the middle ran in front
[1:15:25] of us turned around and ran back
[1:15:27] up and it was until later that day that
[1:15:30] i realized exactly what i actually
[1:15:31] happened
[1:15:34] you don't have to believe it but i know
[1:15:36] it did
[1:15:38] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:15:41] forever
[1:15:42] so if he can do that and you know what
[1:15:44] brother branham said god did that
[1:15:46] so that he could have confidence when
[1:15:48] he's standing before the people that god
[1:15:51] would answer the same you can sit there
[1:15:55] in a situation that looks hopeless
[1:15:57] but the god of hope is lying in your
[1:15:59] heart
[1:16:00] he is part of you and therefore you're
[1:16:03] part of the plan of redemption
[1:16:06] the words you speak make a difference
[1:16:10] now let's just go through some
[1:16:11] scriptures here let's start with luke
[1:16:16] chapter one and there'll be a fair
[1:16:17] amount of scripture reading
[1:16:19] but can't go wrong with scripture
[1:16:20] reading that's the word of god
[1:16:24] you know i could read you what so-and-so
[1:16:26] says about it and what this
[1:16:28] man thought about it and there might be
[1:16:29] some great thoughts and i don't have any
[1:16:31] problem with that there are some
[1:16:33] wonderful men out there but god's word
[1:16:35] never fails
[1:16:37] as men sometimes we have to do some then
[1:16:39] have to take it back and say you now
[1:16:41] that i've looked at it
[1:16:42] i found a better way this was good but
[1:16:45] this is better this is eternal
[1:16:49] brother branhav said if he ever did it
[1:16:51] once he will continue to do it the same
[1:16:53] way
[1:16:54] because it was perfect the first time
[1:16:57] so luke chapter 1 with verse we'll go to
[1:17:00] from verse 28 to 38
[1:17:02] and these are all from luke and john and
[1:17:05] then we'll go into acts
[1:17:06] the book of acts there now what is the
[1:17:09] book of acts
[1:17:11] it's god himself indwelling
[1:17:15] his chosen people those that he call
[1:17:17] right
[1:17:18] and it's the acts of the holy ghost in
[1:17:21] those
[1:17:22] that it's written it was recorded for us
[1:17:25] and what are we being restored back to
[1:17:28] that true pentecost where it's god
[1:17:32] in the people where it's god manifesting
[1:17:34] himself
[1:17:35] it's going all the way back to eden
[1:17:37] again
[1:17:38] that's what it is not just a good story
[1:17:41] not just a good
[1:17:42] a feel-good thing but a reality eternal
[1:17:44] reality
[1:17:46] and the angel came in unto her and said
[1:17:48] hail
[1:17:49] thou art highly favored the lord is with
[1:17:52] thee
[1:17:53] blessed art thou amongst among women
[1:17:56] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[1:17:58] his saying
[1:17:59] and cast in her mind what manner of
[1:18:02] salutation should this be
[1:18:03] i just want to let you know mary was
[1:18:05] human
[1:18:06] she was not the saint that the catholic
[1:18:09] churches have made
[1:18:10] next to god she was a human being
[1:18:14] could you imagine that salutation coming
[1:18:17] up to you
[1:18:17] and something like that sister and
[1:18:21] you know your reaction it would be like
[1:18:23] what
[1:18:24] me you know
[1:18:28] the next verse
[1:18:32] and the angel said under fear not mary
[1:18:35] for thou hast found favor with god
[1:18:38] and i said to you brother sister fear
[1:18:39] not you have found favor with god
[1:18:45] amen you have
[1:18:49] abby she shared the reality
[1:18:52] of finding favor with god because god
[1:18:55] desires to do those things
[1:18:57] it's his nature it's it's character it's
[1:18:58] what he does
[1:19:00] if i could say it makes him happy and
[1:19:03] behold
[1:19:04] thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[1:19:06] bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:19:08] name jesus
[1:19:09] because of isaiah said this and his word
[1:19:11] is being fulfilled
[1:19:13] he shall be great and shall be called
[1:19:14] son of the highest
[1:19:16] and the lord god shall give unto him the
[1:19:18] throne of his father david
[1:19:21] and he shall reign over the house of
[1:19:23] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[1:19:25] shall be no end
[1:19:27] and then mary said unto the angel how
[1:19:29] shall this be
[1:19:32] seen i know not a man everything i know
[1:19:35] about this
[1:19:36] has to be done this way this is
[1:19:40] this is how a child comes
[1:19:43] but something in her is because
[1:19:47] in isaiah a virgin shall conceive had
[1:19:50] been spoken
[1:19:52] and god had to find a resting place to
[1:19:55] set that fulfilling of that word and
[1:19:57] something in
[1:19:58] mary begins to respond to that
[1:20:02] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:20:05] the holy ghost
[1:20:06] shall come upon thee and the power of
[1:20:09] the highest
[1:20:10] shall overshadow thee therefore also
[1:20:13] that holy thing
[1:20:14] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:20:17] called
[1:20:18] the son of god look that hasn't changed
[1:20:22] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[1:20:27] and that holy thing in you is the son of
[1:20:30] god is jesus himself
[1:20:33] that hasn't changed it's not a series of
[1:20:36] works it's not a series of quotes it's
[1:20:38] not
[1:20:38] it's god in you the hope of glory
[1:20:46] let's go to on there and behold watch
[1:20:49] this and thy cousin elizabeth
[1:20:51] she has also conceived a son in her old
[1:20:54] age and this was a sixth month
[1:20:56] with her who was called barren for with
[1:20:59] god
[1:21:00] nothing shall be impossible
[1:21:03] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[1:21:05] lord be it unto me
[1:21:07] according to thy word and the angel
[1:21:09] departed
[1:21:10] the joy of the angel knowing that it had
[1:21:12] been fulfilled as i can
[1:21:14] go now i've done the part
[1:21:17] you know and you know when you have done
[1:21:19] what god has asked you to do
[1:21:21] you can leave and be at rest and joy
[1:21:23] you've done with god
[1:21:24] and you put it in god's hands he'll take
[1:21:26] care of it
[1:21:28] you know you put the plant in the ground
[1:21:30] you've dug you put you put the water
[1:21:32] you let it grow because that's what it's
[1:21:34] going to do
[1:21:36] you put it in somebody's heart and you
[1:21:39] know and let god
[1:21:40] bring the increase now we'll go on to
[1:21:45] 41 i believe it was and it came to pass
[1:21:49] that when elizabeth heard the salutation
[1:21:51] of mary
[1:21:52] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:21:54] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[1:21:57] and she spoke with out with a loud voice
[1:21:59] and said blessed art thou among woman
[1:22:01] and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
[1:22:03] and whence is this to me that the mother
[1:22:06] of my lord should come to me
[1:22:10] look for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[1:22:14] salutation
[1:22:15] sounded in mine ears the babe leaped for
[1:22:19] in my womb for joy
[1:22:21] mary had to speak
[1:22:26] mary had to say something there had to
[1:22:28] be something that
[1:22:30] and that baby inside was given life
[1:22:34] and blessed is she that believed for
[1:22:37] there shall be a performance of those
[1:22:39] things
[1:22:39] which were told her from the lord
[1:22:43] it could just be a good christmas story
[1:22:46] or you can see that he's jesus christ
[1:22:48] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:22:49] that hasn't changed those things which
[1:22:52] god has said
[1:22:54] and there shall be a performance of
[1:22:57] those things
[1:22:58] there will be a people there is a people
[1:23:00] that are letting those things happen in
[1:23:02] their life
[1:23:04] and they are looked at sometimes strange
[1:23:06] and wondered about
[1:23:07] but that's okay if they did that with
[1:23:11] jesus if they've done that with me how
[1:23:12] much more with you
[1:23:16] now let's look at john 1
[1:23:19] first chapter in 29 through 37.
[1:23:23] now here's a part that another human
[1:23:25] plays in this redemption plan
[1:23:28] the next day john seeth jesus coming
[1:23:30] unto him and saith behold
[1:23:32] the lamb of god which taketh away the
[1:23:35] sin of the world
[1:23:37] what an announcement you know all that
[1:23:40] has happened since our father
[1:23:42] adam fell well there's one that's come
[1:23:45] today here he is he's going to make it
[1:23:47] all right
[1:23:49] he's going to restore us back to that
[1:23:51] place
[1:23:52] and john gets to make that announcement
[1:23:55] it wasn't announced in the heavens it
[1:23:57] wasn't a sky written in the heavens
[1:23:59] a man announced it with his voice
[1:24:04] this is he of whom i said after me
[1:24:07] cometh a man which is preferred before
[1:24:10] me
[1:24:10] he was for he was before me
[1:24:14] john is speaking here and i knew him not
[1:24:18] but that he should be made manifest to
[1:24:20] israel therefore i might come baptizing
[1:24:23] with water
[1:24:24] and john bare records saying i saw the
[1:24:26] spirit descending from
[1:24:28] heaven like a dove and a podium but john
[1:24:31] had to make that announcement
[1:24:35] come see a man
[1:24:39] she ran down after she saw she ran down
[1:24:42] to samaria and said
[1:24:44] come see a man and said many believed
[1:24:48] what if she would have stayed there oh
[1:24:50] this is so wonderful so beautiful it's
[1:24:52] all mine
[1:24:53] no something made that samaritan run
[1:24:56] down into samaria and say
[1:24:58] come see a man
[1:25:03] let's continue reading there
[1:25:07] and i knew him not but he that sent me
[1:25:09] to baptize with water the same said unto
[1:25:11] me
[1:25:12] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:25:14] descending and remaining him
[1:25:16] on him the same is which baptizes with
[1:25:18] the holy ghost
[1:25:19] and i saw and bear record that this is
[1:25:22] the son of god
[1:25:25] i saw and bare record this is god living
[1:25:28] in me
[1:25:30] this is god being manifested it's not me
[1:25:33] it's not myself you have to bear that
[1:25:36] same record
[1:25:38] and again the next day after john stood
[1:25:40] and two of his disciples and looking
[1:25:42] upon jesus as he walked he saith
[1:25:44] behold the lamb of god and watch the
[1:25:47] result
[1:25:48] and the two disciples heard him speak
[1:25:50] and they followed jesus
[1:25:54] that's the reason for that is to get
[1:25:56] somebody else to know him
[1:25:58] to love him to follow him to get into
[1:26:00] the same place that you're at
[1:26:02] it's that life in you it's that bubbling
[1:26:04] spring that you can't help
[1:26:09] now let's go into the next scriptures
[1:26:11] and this will be all in the book of acts
[1:26:13] i believe now
[1:26:16] so what is the book of acts it's what
[1:26:20] the holy spirit is doing
[1:26:22] through the disciples through the
[1:26:23] apostles through the men and women
[1:26:26] of of that area in jerusalem to begin
[1:26:29] with
[1:26:30] with god in them
[1:26:34] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:26:36] come
[1:26:37] and they were all with one accord in one
[1:26:40] place
[1:26:41] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:26:43] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[1:26:46] and it filled all the house where they
[1:26:48] were sitting and there appeared unto
[1:26:50] them
[1:26:50] cloven tongues like as a fire
[1:26:54] and it sat upon each them and they were
[1:26:57] filled with the holy ghost
[1:26:59] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:27:01] a spirit gave them utterance
[1:27:04] one to four so we know now watch
[1:27:08] now we're going to skip some parts we're
[1:27:10] going to jump to verse 14.
[1:27:12] but peter's standing here with the
[1:27:13] eleven lift up his voice we know the
[1:27:15] people said they're drunk there's
[1:27:16] something wrong with these people
[1:27:18] and peter says no this is something else
[1:27:20] but peter standing up with the eleven
[1:27:22] lifted up his voice and said unto him ye
[1:27:25] man of judea
[1:27:26] and all you that dwell at jerusalem be
[1:27:28] it known unto you
[1:27:29] and hearken unto my words
[1:27:33] peter is speaking this isn't jesus
[1:27:35] speaking
[1:27:36] this is peter speaking hearken unto my
[1:27:38] words
[1:27:40] for these are not drunken as you suppose
[1:27:42] see that is but the third hour of the
[1:27:44] day but this is that which was spoken by
[1:27:46] the prophet joel
[1:27:48] this is what god said he was going to do
[1:27:51] and now he has performed it
[1:27:55] and it shall come to pass in the last
[1:27:57] days faith god i will pour out of my
[1:27:59] spirit upon all

[1:28:14] shall prophesy
[1:28:16] amen is he the same yesterday today and
[1:28:20] forever was that only for peter no
[1:28:22] this is a promise because he says to you
[1:28:25] and
[1:28:26] continues to go on and going over to
[1:28:29] verse 37
[1:28:30] watch the effect
[1:28:33] and did i i miss a couple of scriptures
[1:28:37] i have here uh verses 37
[1:28:44] maybe i i missed a sec yeah now when
[1:28:47] they heard this
[1:28:48] they were pricked in their hearts all
[1:28:51] that peter said to them
[1:28:53] they were pricked in their hearts and
[1:28:54] said unto peter and the rest of the
[1:28:56] apostles
[1:28:56] men and brethren what shall we do
[1:29:03] what if just put yourself in that point
[1:29:07] your neighbor your coworker your brother
[1:29:10] your sister
[1:29:13] and you've just shared with them and
[1:29:14] they ask you what do i
[1:29:16] do that there's a uh is something in
[1:29:19] their heart crying what do we do now
[1:29:21] how do we get this that you have
[1:29:25] then peter said unto them repent and be
[1:29:28] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:29:30] jesus christ
[1:29:31] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[1:29:33] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:29:35] for the promise is unto you and to your
[1:29:38] children
[1:29:39] and to all that are afar off even as
[1:29:41] many as the lord
[1:29:42] our god shall call
[1:29:47] it hasn't stopped it didn't stop there
[1:29:50] that day of pentecost in jerusalem
[1:29:52] it's continuing he said until that last
[1:29:54] one as brother branham was when he was
[1:29:56] reading in the message
[1:29:57] until that last one whose name is in the
[1:29:59] book
[1:30:00] has got there yet and with
[1:30:05] and with many other words did he testify
[1:30:07] and exhaust saying
[1:30:08] let's we'll just leave that part right
[1:30:10] there
[1:30:13] 41 was it was 41 and
[1:30:16] 47 not the whole run there 41 and they
[1:30:20] gladly received his word and were
[1:30:23] baptized
[1:30:24] and that same day there were added unto
[1:30:27] them
[1:30:27] about 3 000 souls
[1:30:30] praising god in verse 47 and having
[1:30:34] favor with all the people and the lord
[1:30:36] added to the
[1:30:37] church daily such as should be saved
[1:30:42] because peter dared to stand the same
[1:30:45] peter who had denied him
[1:30:48] the same peter who was loud and
[1:30:51] obnoxious at times
[1:30:53] and god had to rebuke him sometimes
[1:30:56] and he and he says ah don't you die and
[1:30:59] say
[1:31:00] and jesus turn around get thee behind me
[1:31:02] satan not calling peter saying he knew
[1:31:04] what spirit was motivating that
[1:31:07] the same they said i will not deny thee
[1:31:08] i will go with you
[1:31:10] i as you're going to deny me through
[1:31:12] three times
[1:31:14] he goes and he hides in shame and after
[1:31:17] jesus resurrection and he tells us go
[1:31:19] tell my disciples
[1:31:20] and peter too sometimes you have to be
[1:31:23] the and peter too
[1:31:25] some things you've done in your life
[1:31:26] some actions you had some ways you felt
[1:31:28] and you fill yourself with
[1:31:29] but god says no you're still included in
[1:31:31] this you're still part of this
[1:31:33] and if god can take somebody like me
[1:31:35] then why couldn't he take somebody like
[1:31:37] any
[1:31:37] all the others he had to die a
[1:31:41] full penalty of death with every
[1:31:44] every bruise and every cut and every
[1:31:47] drop of blood to redeem me
[1:31:50] it covers everybody covers everybody
[1:31:55] acts chapter 5 verses 1 through 5.
[1:32:01] now just watch here but a certain man
[1:32:03] named
[1:32:04] ananias with sapphire and his wife sold
[1:32:06] a possession
[1:32:07] and kept back part of the price you know
[1:32:09] keeping back part of the price was not
[1:32:10] the problem
[1:32:13] sometimes you say i'm going to do this
[1:32:14] i'm a lot this i'm a little like that
[1:32:16] fine that's what you said you're going
[1:32:17] to do
[1:32:18] it's not a problem with that but if you
[1:32:21] represent it wrong something different
[1:32:23] takes place and he kept back part of the
[1:32:25] price his wife
[1:32:26] also being private to it and brought a
[1:32:28] certain part and laid it at the apostles
[1:32:30] feet
[1:32:31] uh but now in peter
[1:32:35] there's what we call the holy ghost in
[1:32:38] peter
[1:32:40] the discerner and the thoughts in the
[1:32:41] intents of the heart
[1:32:45] but peter said ananias why has satan
[1:32:48] filled thine heart to lie to the holy
[1:32:50] ghost
[1:32:52] where was the holy ghost in peter
[1:32:57] where's the holy ghost in you
[1:33:05] and to keep back part of the price of
[1:33:08] the land
[1:33:10] while it remained was it not thine own
[1:33:12] and after it was so was it not thine own
[1:33:14] power why has thou
[1:33:16] conceived this thing in thine heart thou
[1:33:19] has not lied unto men
[1:33:21] but unto god yet he was talking to peter
[1:33:26] but the god in here the one that has the
[1:33:30] power to
[1:33:31] life and death in peter now he says
[1:33:34] you weren't lying to peter you were
[1:33:36] lying to the god that lies within me
[1:33:39] and ananias hearing these words fell
[1:33:41] down and gave up the ghosts
[1:33:43] and great fear came up on all of them
[1:33:45] that heard these things we know the rest
[1:33:47] of the story his wife does the same
[1:33:48] thing
[1:33:51] you know but watch this brother branham
[1:33:55] is told there's a trap laid for you
[1:33:59] and that night in the service if there
[1:34:00] was a young couple he said being immoral
[1:34:02] just well and this this holy spirit told
[1:34:06] him
[1:34:07] speak whatever you will and it shall
[1:34:10] happen did he not say that to him
[1:34:15] yes brother anything he could have said
[1:34:18] could have happened
[1:34:20] but there was something in him but
[1:34:22] brother branham who says
[1:34:23] amazing grace that saved a wretch like
[1:34:26] me
[1:34:27] calls out and says i can give them life
[1:34:32] i can give them that same hope that i
[1:34:34] have and he says
[1:34:36] i forgive you
[1:34:39] the spirit of christ does not condem it
[1:34:42] does not destroy it goes seeking those
[1:34:44] who are
[1:34:45] lost you and i don't know who those are
[1:34:48] so
[1:34:48] everyone we walk and see we should treat
[1:34:51] them as
[1:34:52] one who has the potential to receive
[1:34:56] christ
[1:34:59] you're not the judge let god judge that
[1:35:05] acts chapter eight we'll read verses 26
[1:35:08] through 31 and then 35 to 39 and i did
[1:35:11] that way just to shorten it some
[1:35:14] watch this and the angel of the lord
[1:35:15] spake unto him and i know you've never
[1:35:17] read these scriptures it's all new to
[1:35:18] you right
[1:35:20] no it's the word of god and the angel of
[1:35:22] the lord spake unto philip saying arise
[1:35:24] and go towards the south
[1:35:26] the unto the way they go down from
[1:35:28] jerusalem unto gaza which is desert and
[1:35:30] he arose and went and behold a man of
[1:35:32] ethiopia a eunuch of great authority
[1:35:34] under candace queen of the ethiopians
[1:35:36] who had the charge of all the treasure
[1:35:38] and who had come to jerusalem to worship
[1:35:42] was returning and sitting in his in his
[1:35:44] chair reading isaiah the prophet
[1:35:46] and the spirit said unto philip go near
[1:35:48] and join thyself to this chariot
[1:35:50] so philip ran them there to him and
[1:35:52] heard him read the prophet isaiah and
[1:35:54] said
[1:35:55] understandeth thou without readers and
[1:35:57] he said
[1:35:58] how can i accept some man guide me and
[1:36:01] he desired philip that he would come up
[1:36:03] and sit with him
[1:36:06] philip well no it doesn't work that way
[1:36:10] you have to have the holy ghost come and
[1:36:12] fall upon you and hit no
[1:36:13] philip went up and said because now that
[1:36:16] holy ghost is lying in philip
[1:36:19] and the one who wrote the book and has
[1:36:21] the full understanding of it
[1:36:22] then now using philip's voice could
[1:36:25] begin to express
[1:36:26] what the word of god is
[1:36:30] and he hasn't changed now he says
[1:36:35] and then philip let's let's see we were
[1:36:37] going to go 35-30 on yes
[1:36:39] then philip opened his mouth and began
[1:36:41] at the same scripture and preached unto
[1:36:42] him jesus
[1:36:44] not peter not the apostles not
[1:36:47] mary he preached to them jesus and they
[1:36:50] went
[1:36:51] on their way and they came to a certain
[1:36:52] water and the eunuch said see here's
[1:36:54] water
[1:36:55] what does hinder me to be baptized
[1:36:58] that which uh philip spoke to him is now
[1:37:01] burning in his heart
[1:37:03] and philip said if thou believest with
[1:37:05] all thine heart thou missed and the
[1:37:06] answer said i believe that jesus christ
[1:37:09] is the son of god and he commanded
[1:37:11] chariot to stand still and they went
[1:37:12] down
[1:37:13] both into the water both philip and the
[1:37:15] enoch and baptized him
[1:37:18] and when they were come out of the water
[1:37:20] the spirit of the lord caught away
[1:37:21] philip
[1:37:22] that eunuch saw him nor no more and he
[1:37:25] went on his way rejoicing
[1:37:27] the joy of who knows what he was singing
[1:37:30] what he was rejoicing what he was saying
[1:37:32] this little white of mine i'm going to
[1:37:33] let it shine
[1:37:36] but what god used a man named philip
[1:37:44] it's a book of acts is he not the same
[1:37:46] yesterday today and forever
[1:37:49] and let's go to acts chapter 9 and we'll
[1:37:51] read verse 1 and then we'll go to 10 and
[1:37:53] 16.
[1:37:54] and saul yet breathing out threatenings
[1:37:57] and slaughter against the disciples of
[1:37:59] the lord
[1:38:00] went unto the high priest now you know
[1:38:01] the story there saul
[1:38:04] well he was still named saul in his
[1:38:07] righteousness self-righteousness of the
[1:38:10] law
[1:38:10] was going to take care of all these
[1:38:13] problems he was going to put an end to
[1:38:15] this heresy
[1:38:17] because that was saul under
[1:38:20] his own spirit now god knew that
[1:38:25] you and i would have never given saul a
[1:38:27] chance to be paul he said no way
[1:38:30] no way that just doesn't work we need
[1:38:33] somebody
[1:38:34] who has nev no god can take the vilest
[1:38:37] dirtiest
[1:38:39] uh i don't mean this wrong but a
[1:38:41] filthiest person
[1:38:42] man or woman and make him a true child
[1:38:45] saint of god
[1:38:50] i'm a i'm testimony of that how many are
[1:38:52] two here
[1:38:53] what god has done he's the same
[1:38:55] yesterday today and forever
[1:38:58] and then and there was a certain
[1:39:00] disciple at damascus and we know paul's
[1:39:02] experience now
[1:39:04] he's had that pillar fire that knocked
[1:39:06] him off blinds him
[1:39:08] and there was a certain disciple in
[1:39:10] damascus named ananias
[1:39:12] and to him the say the lord in a vision
[1:39:14] ananias
[1:39:15] and he said bo behold i am here lord
[1:39:18] obviously ananias had enough experience
[1:39:20] to know who was speaking to him
[1:39:22] because he immediately responds here i
[1:39:24] am lord and the lord said unto him
[1:39:26] arising go into the street which is
[1:39:28] called straight and
[1:39:29] inquire the house of judas for one
[1:39:31] called saul of tarsus
[1:39:33] for behold he prayeth
[1:39:36] and he's seen a vision in a vision a man
[1:39:39] named ananias coming in
[1:39:40] and putting his hand on him that he
[1:39:42] might receive sight and an eye and
[1:39:43] answer
[1:39:44] lord haven't you seen the latest news
[1:39:47] haven't you read the paper lord haven't
[1:39:49] you heard what's really going on with
[1:39:51] this guy
[1:39:52] you know come on get caught up with
[1:39:53] what's happening now you know
[1:39:56] lord i have heard by many of this man
[1:39:59] how much evil he has done to thy saints
[1:40:03] at jerusalem he justifies himself right
[1:40:05] there lord
[1:40:06] he's done so much he's hurting the
[1:40:07] believers lord
[1:40:10] how you know i don't know i might have
[1:40:12] had the same reaction
[1:40:14] you know and here he hath authority from
[1:40:18] the chief priest to bind
[1:40:19] all that call on thy name but the lord
[1:40:22] said unto him
[1:40:22] go thy way for he is a chosen vessel
[1:40:25] unto me
[1:40:26] to bear my name before the gentiles and
[1:40:29] kings and the children of israel for i
[1:40:32] will show him how great things he must
[1:40:34] suffer
[1:40:34] for my name's sake that last part gets
[1:40:38] added in there too
[1:40:40] as brother lyle spoke here it comes with
[1:40:43] could i save the package the benefits
[1:40:45] package
[1:40:46] we will suffer but we will ring
[1:40:50] ananias go pray for this man
[1:40:54] and then i said yes lord after he argued
[1:40:57] with him for a little while
[1:40:59] lord i want to do it but but
[1:41:04] here we go acts 10
[1:41:07] 44 through 48.
[1:41:10] we know the story here peter cornelius
[1:41:12] peter's up in the temple
[1:41:14] up in the uh the room up top on the roof
[1:41:17] resting and cornelius is something in
[1:41:20] his heart is crying out
[1:41:22] maybe he doesn't really know what it is
[1:41:24] but something's crying out there's got
[1:41:25] to be more to life
[1:41:26] than this
[1:41:30] while peter yet spake these words after
[1:41:32] he comes and he means and you you know
[1:41:34] the story there
[1:41:35] god working on both ends since peter
[1:41:37] over there in cornelius he's expecting
[1:41:39] him
[1:41:39] because that's how god works and while
[1:41:42] peter yet spake these words the holy
[1:41:44] ghost fell
[1:41:45] on them which heard the word and they of
[1:41:48] the circumcision which believed were
[1:41:50] astonished
[1:41:51] as many as came with peter because that
[1:41:53] on the gentiles also was poured out
[1:41:56] the gift of the holy ghost oh my lord do
[1:41:59] you know what you're doing
[1:42:01] those are gentiles
[1:42:05] lord hey that may be
[1:42:08] a believer that may be a child of god
[1:42:10] there
[1:42:12] just share what you have let it take its
[1:42:16] effect
[1:42:17] let it root down in somebody's heart
[1:42:19] just like it wrote it down in yours
[1:42:24] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:42:25] and magnify god
[1:42:27] then answered peter can any man forbid
[1:42:30] water that these should be not
[1:42:32] should not be baptized which have
[1:42:34] received the holy ghost as well as we
[1:42:37] and he commanded them to be baptized
[1:42:40] come on over and have another cup of tea
[1:42:42] with me and share some more of this
[1:42:44] good news the same neighbor that may
[1:42:47] have thought you were crazy before that
[1:42:49] but something inside begins to cry out
[1:42:53] and if you have it you can give it
[1:42:56] acts 15 36 through 40.
[1:43:04] and some days after paul said unto
[1:43:06] barnabas
[1:43:08] men full of the holy ghost they were
[1:43:10] still men
[1:43:13] let us go again and visit our brethren
[1:43:15] in every city where we have preached the
[1:43:17] word of the lord
[1:43:18] and see how they do and barnabas
[1:43:21] determined to
[1:43:22] to take with him john whose surname was
[1:43:24] mark
[1:43:26] but paul thought not good to take him
[1:43:28] with him who departed
[1:43:30] from them from family
[1:43:33] and went not with him to the work and
[1:43:35] the contention was so sharp between them
[1:43:38] that they departed asunder one from the
[1:43:40] other
[1:43:40] so barnabas took mark and sailed and
[1:43:43] unto cyprus and paul chose silas and
[1:43:46] departed being recommended by the
[1:43:48] brethren
[1:43:49] unto the grace of god
[1:43:53] i'd love to say that when the holy ghost
[1:43:57] dwells your life you're not human
[1:43:58] anymore
[1:44:00] but you still have this body
[1:44:04] you still have to yield it you still
[1:44:06] have to surrender
[1:44:07] you still have to say i'm sorry forgive
[1:44:10] me
[1:44:12] and he does
[1:44:16] it doesn't make you a robot it doesn't
[1:44:17] make you an angel it makes you a child
[1:44:20] of god filled with the holy ghost
[1:44:22] who still has to battle with the sky
[1:44:24] daily
[1:44:26] that's why these things were put in the
[1:44:28] word of god so we would understand that
[1:44:33] and then from there we'll go
[1:44:42] what was the next scriptures i put acts
[1:44:44] 69 i think
[1:44:48] now remember brother lyle
[1:44:51] spoke here
[1:44:55] how about that macedonian call
[1:44:59] and sometimes there's a call in your
[1:45:00] life sometimes there's something to go
[1:45:03] go this way turn down this way and
[1:45:06] somebody there
[1:45:07] for you to help but it's not your job to
[1:45:11] save them
[1:45:13] it's your job to give them share with
[1:45:16] them
[1:45:17] i i remember one time driving down the
[1:45:19] road and i was
[1:45:21] on the company vehicle with david's
[1:45:22] kitchens then
[1:45:24] and there was a flat a car with a flat
[1:45:27] tire it was a
[1:45:29] big old cadillac the big cars back then
[1:45:32] with an older couple the lady was
[1:45:34] standing outside and she was an older
[1:45:35] lady so i stopped
[1:45:38] and to help so i offered
[1:45:41] to fix you know change out the tire and
[1:45:44] it was close it's on
[1:45:45] on silver belt close to the um animal
[1:45:47] control place there
[1:45:48] just right right in front there so
[1:45:52] i began to help her and i put
[1:45:55] i changed the tire for her the jack and
[1:45:57] all and she said how much do i owe you i
[1:45:59] said
[1:46:00] nothing i didn't do this for money
[1:46:04] right about there her husband was coming
[1:46:06] back up this is kind of funny i still
[1:46:08] laugh think about a laugh
[1:46:10] and her husband comes up and says what
[1:46:12] do we owe you and she says oh honey
[1:46:13] honey no
[1:46:14] no he doesn't want anything
[1:46:17] but that's what i told her well it's
[1:46:19] what i told her
[1:46:20] all she was doing was telling him what i
[1:46:22] had said
[1:46:24] i keep my word and said no thank you now
[1:46:28] when i drove away i said
[1:46:29] you could have got some money out of
[1:46:30] this but you know
[1:46:32] be a christian keep your word
[1:46:36] they saw the davis kitchen sign there i
[1:46:38] don't know that's who i was being
[1:46:39] employed
[1:46:40] at the time i was during work hours i
[1:46:41] was being paid by them
[1:46:43] maybe somebody said hey i'm gonna i need
[1:46:45] a kitchen
[1:46:46] i don't know i was just but
[1:46:50] it is it is part of the life of a
[1:46:52] christian
[1:46:54] because when god is walking through the
[1:46:56] the jerusalem
[1:46:57] all of their and there's a situation he
[1:46:59] would stop jesus would stop they
[1:47:02] there's a funeral procession and the the
[1:47:04] sadness and the cry affected him he went
[1:47:06] raise him from the dead never said now
[1:47:09] you owe me
[1:47:10] you got to come to my next meetings and
[1:47:11] you better fill the offering box up
[1:47:14] had nothing to do with it i remember a
[1:47:17] testimony
[1:47:18] of a ministering brother and it was two
[1:47:21] brothers and they were ministering they
[1:47:22] were busy and they were sharing the
[1:47:24] testimony
[1:47:24] when they were pen in a pentecostal
[1:47:26] organization and they were traveled with
[1:47:28] this one minister
[1:47:30] and he would tell them what stories he
[1:47:32] was going to tell the congregation that
[1:47:34] day or
[1:47:34] the meeting so he could draw the
[1:47:36] offering out of him
[1:47:38] and he would tell him the sob stories
[1:47:40] and he goes they were made up
[1:47:43] he said he was so good at it he said me
[1:47:45] and the other brother would put
[1:47:46] offering two
[1:47:50] he goes that that spirit too
[1:47:53] both spirits work satan has deceived
[1:47:57] many
[1:47:58] god has saved his children they were
[1:48:02] and he goes not only that he said but
[1:48:04] folks would
[1:48:05] the sisters would bake him a cake or a
[1:48:08] pie or something
[1:48:09] it would come in he said we we traveled
[1:48:10] with him we'd be in his office and he
[1:48:12] would take it
[1:48:13] and dump it right into the trash can and
[1:48:16] then he would say
[1:48:17] when he's behind the pulpit he would say
[1:48:19] oh and thank you for
[1:48:21] the cake oh it was well taken care of
[1:48:25] he goes he was throwing him in the trash
[1:48:28] is that the life of a christian
[1:48:30] is that the life of god no he went
[1:48:33] even where he was not wanted
[1:48:38] why did he go there because he knew
[1:48:41] there was a woman that was going to be
[1:48:42] coming by
[1:48:43] a woman of ill fame a woman that
[1:48:46] nobody wanted around and was going to
[1:48:48] come and wash his feet
[1:48:51] he knew there was one there and he was
[1:48:54] willing to go
[1:48:54] and be embarrassed shamed made fun of
[1:48:57] for that one
[1:49:04] so a vision appeared to paul in the
[1:49:06] night there stood a man in macedonia and
[1:49:08] prayed for him
[1:49:09] prayed him saying come over to macedonia
[1:49:12] and help us
[1:49:15] and it came to pass as they went to
[1:49:17] prayer a certain damsel possessed where
[1:49:19] the spirit of divination met us
[1:49:21] and brought her her masters much again
[1:49:23] saying but much gain
[1:49:25] made their income you know the story
[1:49:27] here they get thrown in prison for
[1:49:29] casting the demon out of that
[1:49:31] damsel you know you go
[1:49:35] share the gospel with somebody and it
[1:49:37] revives them
[1:49:38] there's some people are going to get
[1:49:39] upset there are some people that are
[1:49:41] going to get mad they're going to say he
[1:49:42] used to be our drinking buddy she used
[1:49:44] to hang with us i think
[1:49:45] but not no more but to the one who
[1:49:49] received that life
[1:49:50] it meant eternity to that one
[1:49:55] so he says
[1:49:58] so let's go on so i just just wanted to
[1:50:00] highlight that
[1:50:01] where we go and when they had laid many
[1:50:04] stripes
[1:50:05] on them they cast them into prison
[1:50:07] charging the jailer
[1:50:08] to keep them safe the lord through paul
[1:50:12] delivers one who's being tormented by
[1:50:15] spirits
[1:50:16] and the reward was at it is he got
[1:50:18] beaten
[1:50:19] whipped and thrown in jail and this is
[1:50:22] where i always say silas has
[1:50:23] got some thoughts and some questions
[1:50:28] paul you've you've told us of these
[1:50:29] wonderful things god is but you you
[1:50:31] didn't
[1:50:32] tell us the whole story you know
[1:50:36] we went here and over there and here but
[1:50:38] you know there's a lot more of the story
[1:50:39] sometimes
[1:50:40] you know and when the who having
[1:50:43] received such a charge
[1:50:45] thrust them into the inner prison and
[1:50:47] made their feet
[1:50:48] fast in the stocks
[1:50:52] um couldn't go anywhere
[1:50:56] so paul says let's take advantage of
[1:50:58] this we're not going anywhere
[1:50:59] why don't we begin to have a service and
[1:51:01] worship the lord here
[1:51:03] rather than mope and cry and complain
[1:51:06] let's begin to praise the lord
[1:51:09] i think paul had been here before maybe
[1:51:10] had done this before
[1:51:12] and at midnight paul and silas prayed
[1:51:15] and sang praises unto god
[1:51:17] and the prisoners heard them and
[1:51:19] suddenly there was a great earthquake so
[1:51:21] that the foundations of the prison were
[1:51:23] shaken
[1:51:23] and immediately all the doors were open
[1:51:25] and everyone's bands were loosed
[1:51:28] it's amazing how god opens doors with
[1:51:29] earthquakes huh even for peter
[1:51:32] and then he gets there to the when the
[1:51:34] angels combine to deliver him and he
[1:51:35] gets to the house and they're going that
[1:51:36] can't be peter you're in prison
[1:51:39] oh he's still the same yesterday today
[1:51:42] and forever
[1:51:44] and the keeper of the prison awakening
[1:51:46] out of his sleep and seeing the
[1:51:47] doors open he drew out his sword and
[1:51:49] would have killed him
[1:51:51] hoping that the prisoners had fled
[1:51:54] now can you imagine if that happened
[1:51:57] here in one of the prisons in tucson
[1:52:00] i don't know how many of them would stay
[1:52:02] a lot of them would run
[1:52:05] but paul crowed with a loud voice saying
[1:52:08] do myself no harm
[1:52:09] for we're all here. now did
[1:52:12] paul go out and check to see if they
[1:52:15] were all there i don't think so
[1:52:17] i think that was the holy ghost in him
[1:52:18] just speaking out
[1:52:21] then he called for a light and sprang in
[1:52:23] and came trembling and fell down before
[1:52:25] paul and silas
[1:52:26] and brought them out and said sirs what
[1:52:28] must i do to be saved
[1:52:31] well you've got to clean up your life
[1:52:35] you got to change you got to go repent
[1:52:37] about this you got to go death you got
[1:52:38] to go do this much service you got to go
[1:52:40] do this
[1:52:41] you got to come the way i came okay
[1:52:43] that's the only way god saves people
[1:52:46] no what did paul say and they said
[1:52:48] believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:52:50] and thou shalt be saved and thy house
[1:52:56] you know paul knew if anybody paul knew
[1:52:59] his background he writes it
[1:53:03] i was a a hebrew of hebrews
[1:53:06] the law and all he said but i also know
[1:53:09] i killed christians
[1:53:10] i persecuted them i was a i
[1:53:13] was against this thing that we called
[1:53:15] heresy paul in no wise
[1:53:17] could glorify himself and he knew that
[1:53:19] but he also knew what god had done in
[1:53:21] his life
[1:53:24] and they spake unto him the word of the
[1:53:25] lord and all that were in his house and
[1:53:27] he took them that same hour of the night
[1:53:29] and washed their stripes
[1:53:31] and was baptized he and all his
[1:53:33] straightway
[1:53:34] and when he had brought them into his
[1:53:36] house he set meat
[1:53:37] before them and rejoiced believing in
[1:53:40] god
[1:53:41] with all his house
[1:53:45] and silas goes paul it was
[1:53:48] worth it but a couple hours ago he's
[1:53:51] asking paul
[1:53:52] how did we get in here i think he was
[1:53:56] human
[1:53:59] acts 18 verses 5
[1:54:03] through 11 finishing up with this
[1:54:06] and when silas and timotheus were come
[1:54:08] from macedonia's paul was pressed in the
[1:54:10] spirit
[1:54:11] and testified to the jews that jesus was
[1:54:14] a christ
[1:54:15] and when they opposed themselves and
[1:54:17] blasphemed he shook his raven and said
[1:54:18] unto them
[1:54:19] your blood be upon your own heads i am
[1:54:22] clean from henceforth i will go to the
[1:54:24] gentiles
[1:54:25] paul gave them that option you give them
[1:54:27] that option
[1:54:29] you let them make the decision
[1:54:33] lay it before them what they do with it
[1:54:35] you don't have control over that
[1:54:37] but it's your responsibility to be a
[1:54:40] christian
[1:54:40] before them and when
[1:54:44] let's go on to the and he departed then
[1:54:47] and entered
[1:54:47] into a certain man's house named justice
[1:54:50] one that worshipped god whose house
[1:54:52] joined
[1:54:53] hard to the synagogue and crispus and
[1:54:55] the chief ruler of the synagogue
[1:54:57] believed on the lord
[1:54:59] with all his house and many of the
[1:55:01] corinthians hearing believed
[1:55:03] and were baptized
[1:55:07] and now we have the book of corinthians
[1:55:10] and now we have
[1:55:11] all this that was recorded and written
[1:55:14] because god indwelled a man and that man
[1:55:17] went
[1:55:18] out and shared
[1:55:21] the good news and then spake the lord to
[1:55:25] paul in this
[1:55:26] night by vision do not be afraid but
[1:55:28] speak
[1:55:30] and hold not thy peace for i am with
[1:55:32] thee
[1:55:33] no man shall set beyond thee to hurt
[1:55:36] thee for i have much
[1:55:38] people in this city
[1:55:42] god knew that told paul don't worry
[1:55:44] about it
[1:55:46] i have much people that's why you're
[1:55:48] here
[1:55:50] you know why you're here on earth today
[1:55:54] because you represent
[1:55:57] and give light the lord jesus christ to
[1:56:00] others
[1:56:01] the only source of life
[1:56:07] remember the brother branham talks about
[1:56:10] the
[1:56:11] little two and a half dog i think he
[1:56:12] called it
[1:56:14] half tall and too long got run over by a
[1:56:18] car
[1:56:20] and brother brahm reminds the lord you
[1:56:21] said if i delighted myself in you
[1:56:24] you would give me the desires of my
[1:56:26] heart
[1:56:28] and he goes and gives that dog back its
[1:56:30] life
[1:56:32] remember a possum coming up there to his
[1:56:34] house
[1:56:36] because it's christ in you the hope of
[1:56:38] glory
[1:56:41] that's how he works today that's what he
[1:56:43] does today
[1:56:45] and i know it's a whole lot easier to be
[1:56:47] around all the christians
[1:56:50] and you know it's it's it's a beautiful
[1:56:52] harmony when all the believers are
[1:56:53] together
[1:56:55] but we have to go out and shine this
[1:56:58] light
[1:56:59] wherever we are and i always remember
[1:57:03] that
[1:57:05] fellowship that brother branham is
[1:57:06] having up in colorado the musicians with
[1:57:09] me
[1:57:10] come up he's having that fellowship in
[1:57:13] colorado with the lord jesus
[1:57:14] god himself and a storm comes into the
[1:57:18] way
[1:57:18] and begins to disrupt it and god tells
[1:57:22] them
[1:57:22] speak to the storm
[1:57:26] because i want to continue this
[1:57:28] fellowship
[1:57:31] when that storm in your life begins to
[1:57:34] interfere
[1:57:35] with the fellowship between you and god
[1:57:38] speak to the storm
[1:57:42] say no not today i'm having fellowship
[1:57:45] with the king of kings and the lord of
[1:57:47] lords
[1:57:49] your part of redemption is to share
[1:57:52] what god has done for you to someone
[1:57:55] else and give them life
[1:57:59] amen say lord help me
[1:58:02] let me be a true witness
[1:58:05] let this life that is in me that comes
[1:58:08] for you be sure to others bow our hands
[1:58:12] lord it puts us a challenge today
[1:58:16] it's easy just to stay at home and sit
[1:58:19] down
[1:58:22] and say well if they're of god they'll
[1:58:23] come
[1:58:25] but how do we not know that somebody is
[1:58:27] waiting
[1:58:29] for someone to come and share and that
[1:58:30] one is you
[1:58:32] that one is me maybe not by words
[1:58:36] sometimes it's just an action you told
[1:58:40] them
[1:58:41] well you gave me a cold cup of water you
[1:58:44] fed me you clothed me and they asked you
[1:58:48] when did you do this and he said to
[1:58:50] these
[1:58:51] when you came and you did that to these
[1:58:53] mind you were doing it unto me lord once
[1:58:55] we realized that
[1:58:56] these are your children these are those
[1:58:59] that you paid the price for those are
[1:59:00] those that you redeem
[1:59:03] maybe a word maybe an action something
[1:59:06] lord
[1:59:08] that would cause one to turn and look
[1:59:12] towards jesus as their help lord like
[1:59:14] you've done for us
[1:59:17] till that last one is in until that body
[1:59:20] is whole
[1:59:21] and you say come up heather come up
[1:59:23] higher lord
[1:59:25] help us to do our part and be willing we
[1:59:27] pray
[1:59:28] in jesus christ's name amen
[1:59:31] if he redeemed me can i redeem others
[1:59:36] if be willing to love me then he would
[1:59:38] love others
[1:59:40] he became me so that i might
[1:59:44] become him

[2:02:01] him with others not to oh i'm him i get
[2:02:05] to
[2:02:05] stand in the hole no no to become him to
[2:02:08] others
[2:02:10] that's why he brother says he wrapped
[2:02:12] himself in flesh
[2:02:14] to unite it again so that you could
[2:02:16] continue the work
[2:02:18] [Music]
