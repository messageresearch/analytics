[8:43] through the last couple of weeks and

[9:28] brought sarah home she was in the
[9:30] hospital for about four days
[9:33] because she tested positive in the
[9:35] dialysis center then
[9:37] really could do nothing for her
[9:39] they would isolate her and it's much
[9:41] harder so
[9:42] took her to the hospital and she did
[9:44] test positive
[9:46] and they examined her closely the
[9:48] doctors still want to find something
[9:50] wrong with her
[9:51] and when it was all said and done the
[9:53] doctor said there's nothing wrong with
[9:55] your blood it's perfect
[9:57] and they said your your port is still
[9:59] working perfectly
[10:01] and she said i told you it was just
[10:02] results of the
[10:04] the positive test
[10:06] so she came home yesterday weak and

[20:37] he looked at me and he said you have two
[20:39] things in your heart you're asking the
[20:41] lord for
[20:42] and it was two two individuals that it
[20:44] was in my heart that god would would
[20:47] reach to them
[20:48] and the lord called that out right then
[20:50] in the ear
[20:52] and then in the service where the
[20:53] shelley had walked down
[20:55] that center aisle praying over the folks
[20:58] and as he got towards the back maybe
[21:00] around where sister lydia is back there
[21:02] he began to speak in tongues looking
[21:04] over at a family to one side
[21:07] and he began to speak in tongues and all
[21:09] of us heard the tongues
[21:12] except for
[21:14] the husband and the wife the son-in-law
[21:16] and the daughter
[21:18] and and the sister had felt that
[21:20] the failure of the family was all her
[21:22] fault and she was just feeling
[21:24] really bad
[21:26] and as brother shelley spoke in tongues
[21:29] the son-in-law the daughter heard it all
[21:30] in english
[21:32] and he was telling her sister it's not
[21:34] been your fault it's not been and he
[21:36] told her
[21:37] without i don't think he knew either
[21:40] what had gone on in her life and they
[21:42] heard it all in english
[21:44] and i'll tell you this not brother

[34:59] i'm so thankful very thankful to be able
[35:03] to
[35:04] come with my entire family for
[35:07] harmony this year
[35:09] and
[35:11] for whatever my opinion is worth
[35:14] i think it was one of the greatest
[35:17] we've only attended five or six
[35:21] but the atmosphere this year was so
[35:25] so special
[35:27] i feel that lingering presence of the
[35:29] lord
[35:31] here this morning and looking at this
[35:34] platform it's all different the chairs
[35:36] are gone and the singers
[35:38] so many of them have gone back to their
[35:40] places but
[35:41] oh what a time we had together in the
[35:44] presence of the lord
[35:46] there's nothing like the beauty of
[35:48] brethren dwelling together
[35:50] in unity it's like that oil that ran
[35:54] all the way down the corners of aaron's
[35:56] beard and all the way down to the
[35:58] bottoms of his garment
[36:01] i'm so thankful that we can gather
[36:03] together in unity around the word amen
[36:06] so i'm glad to see all of you here
[36:10] i will not get the name just right i
[36:12] don't think is it is it mcgowan
[36:15] it is mcgowan
[36:17] for those of you that might not know
[36:20] maybe you know him better than i do but
[36:22] it's wonderful to look and see pastor
[36:24] mcgowan and his wife they were here for
[36:27] harmony and he pastors in anchorage
[36:30] alaska is that right no
[36:32] it is right anchorage alaska
[36:35] they're here for a few more warm days
[36:38] i'm assuming
[36:40] so nice to see them
[36:43] isaiah 54 17
[36:46] no weapon
[36:50] none
[36:52] that is formed against thee
[36:55] shall prosper
[36:58] hallelujah
[36:59] and every tongue
[37:02] that shall rise against thee in judgment
[37:06] thou shalt condemn
[37:09] this is the heritage
[37:12] of the servants of the lord
[37:16] and their
[37:17] righteousness
[37:19] is
[37:21] what does it say
[37:23] of me
[37:25] saith the lord
[37:28] it's not my righteousness
[37:30] it's not your righteousness
[37:33] if we have any righteousness at all it's
[37:36] because we are clothed today
[37:39] in the righteousness of the lord jesus
[37:41] christ
[37:42] i know some of you cringe
[37:45] at the reading of another translation so
[37:48] i'm going to do it just for you this
[37:49] morning
[37:51] in the amplified version
[37:53] of that same verse it says
[37:56] but no weapon that is formed against you
[38:00] shall prosper
[38:02] and every tongue that shall rise against
[38:05] you in judgment you shall show
[38:08] to be in the wrong but i want you to
[38:11] listen to this
[38:13] this
[38:14] peace
[38:16] righteousness
[38:18] security
[38:20] triumph
[38:22] over opposition
[38:24] is the heritage
[38:27] of the servants of the lord
[38:30] are there any servants of the lord here
[38:32] this morning
[38:33] and it says those
[38:36] in whom the ideal
[38:40] servant of the lord
[38:42] is reproduced
[38:45] i read this version because of that
[38:48] phrase
[38:50] it's those in whom
[38:53] the ideal servant of the lord
[38:56] is reproduced
[38:58] this is us these are his servants
[39:02] he is the ideal servant
[39:05] his character
[39:07] is reproduced in his little wife
[39:11] this is the righteousness or
[39:14] the vindication
[39:16] which they obtain
[39:17] from me
[39:19] this is that which i impart to them
[39:24] as their justification
[39:27] says the lord
[39:29] i like those words this morning let's
[39:32] bow our heads together lord
[39:35] we are gathered here today in your name
[39:40] we are just a bit slight in number
[39:43] many are fighting sickness
[39:46] and symptoms even as we struggle a
[39:49] little in our own throat this morning
[39:52] we are thinking about those who are far
[39:56] worse off than any of us here today
[39:59] they are sick some fighting for their
[40:02] life
[40:03] some with so many problems burdened so
[40:06] low
[40:07] under such heavy weight that they're not
[40:10] even able to be gathered with saints
[40:12] today and have some of that burden
[40:15] lifted
[40:16] so we lift them up to you o god
[40:19] we stand with them in their time of need
[40:24] and we ask that you will go to them even
[40:27] now hallelujah and touch them by the
[40:30] power of your might
[40:32] heal them deliver them
[40:35] break them out of oppression and
[40:38] depression in the name of the lord jesus
[40:41] christ we heard oh lord about loved ones
[40:44] who have just recently
[40:47] taken their journey from this life would
[40:50] you come today and comfort hearts
[40:53] around the world across this city
[40:55] who are missing their loved ones
[40:59] oh god we pray that the testimony that
[41:02] comes back to us is true
[41:04] and that as they're slipping out of here
[41:07] they settle all old accounts and they
[41:10] trust in your righteousness
[41:13] we're here today lord because we know
[41:16] this is a good place to be
[41:18] where your presence is where your word
[41:22] is magnified
[41:24] we are not so naive as to believe that
[41:27] our enemy has not come
[41:29] he has also gathered today
[41:32] to distract us to hinder us to afflict
[41:35] us but we will not look at him
[41:38] we will not focus on him we will look
[41:42] away to jesus today
[41:44] we will recognize that you have not
[41:47] changed
[41:48] that your power
[41:50] remains the same
[41:52] come today lord as your word goes forth
[41:56] and meet needs in this house
[41:58] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[42:02] christ we pray
[42:03] and the saints said
[42:06] you may be seated together this morning
[42:09] i once again
[42:11] struggled in the evening last night
[42:15] my heart going somewhere else in the
[42:17] word
[42:19] but the spirit of the lord
[42:21] pulling me back to these thoughts
[42:24] i've already delivered this message in
[42:26] this city already this time
[42:28] and some of you were there and so you
[42:31] will
[42:33] show me some mercy i hope
[42:35] because i feel like i have an assignment
[42:38] today
[42:39] to deliver this word
[42:41] now i don't have to worry about who it
[42:43] applies to
[42:44] because i know that god's word applies
[42:47] to all of us
[42:48] if you're not going through a battle
[42:50] right now you may be before you go to
[42:53] bed tonight
[42:54] and there's power enough in this word
[42:57] and in this message that god has given
[43:00] us to cause us to be able to overcome
[43:03] anything
[43:04] and everything that the enemy would
[43:06] throw against us in this hour
[43:09] i want you to know today that we are not
[43:11] a defeated people
[43:13] we are an overcoming people
[43:16] because greater is he that is in us than
[43:20] he that is in the world if we had to win
[43:24] this thing by ourselves we're all in
[43:26] trouble
[43:28] i don't have the strength to do it on my
[43:30] own but i'm so glad brother aaron we
[43:33] don't have to because he lives in my
[43:35] shoes he walks in me that's the promise
[43:39] when you receive the holy spirit you're
[43:42] receiving the very life of jesus christ
[43:46] doesn't matter how we feel today
[43:50] i want to remind you what brother adam
[43:51] said he said what does feelings have to
[43:54] do with it anyway
[43:56] not one
[43:57] little thing not an iota this morning
[44:00] it's not how we feel
[44:02] it's not what we see with our eyes
[44:04] it's not what things look like or sound
[44:07] like or smell like it's what god's word
[44:10] says and the god's word says no
[44:14] weapon
[44:16] none
[44:18] zilch
[44:19] that is formed against you
[44:22] will prosper
[44:24] because you are walking in the
[44:27] righteousness
[44:29] of the living god
[44:31] if you believe that same man
[44:34] so i want to ask you a question this
[44:36] morning
[44:40] how many of you have ever been told in
[44:42] your life
[44:44] that you
[44:46] are your greatest enemy
[44:48] has anybody ever looked at you and said
[44:50] hey you are your worst enemy let me see
[44:53] your hand again well that's almost all
[44:56] of us
[44:58] and i want you to know
[45:00] this morning i want to take this little
[45:02] thought don't be the weapon
[45:07] that is formed against your life
[45:11] you see sometimes the enemy doesn't have
[45:13] to go very far
[45:15] to find a weapon to form against us
[45:19] because we have fallen into a place
[45:23] of cooperation with him
[45:26] and we're helping him out giving him all
[45:28] the ammunition he needs to attack our
[45:31] life
[45:32] by the way we live
[45:34] by the way we think by the way we speak
[45:38] by the way we get caught in a rut
[45:41] and we get locked in a box
[45:43] and we don't expect very much and so we
[45:46] don't get very much but i want you to
[45:49] know we ought to be a people that
[45:51] constantly raise our expectation
[45:54] because jesus is still bigger than all
[45:58] of our situations
[46:00] there's no virus bigger than he is
[46:03] there's no problem no situation no
[46:06] heartache that's bigger than he is
[46:09] and i want to tell you something yes we
[46:12] we need to use wisdom
[46:14] we need to be careful we need to take
[46:17] care of ourselves absolutely but as that
[46:21] little rumble begins to go across the
[46:24] city i hear they're sick over there i
[46:28] hear that they were passing the virus
[46:31] along because they were all gathered
[46:34] together you just tell them that we came
[46:38] in faith believing that he's who he said
[46:43] he is and that's how we're able to be
[46:45] here today we're not cowering in fear
[46:49] but we're standing in faith
[46:52] knowing that he is able to perform what
[46:55] he has promised so yes use wisdom
[46:59] be careful
[47:00] if you don't feel well stay home
[47:03] but don't get in a place of fear
[47:07] so that the enemy is able to lock you in
[47:11] if you fear you open the door for every
[47:14] weapon the enemy has to throw against
[47:17] your life didn't brother branham come
[47:19] with a message that ended up in a little
[47:22] book about cancer
[47:24] don't fear it
[47:27] i'm telling you this
[47:28] dr google
[47:30] is making a lot of problems for the
[47:34] bride of jesus christ have you ever
[47:37] heard of dr google
[47:41] you're going to help me this morning
[47:43] oh yes
[47:45] we get a symptom
[47:47] we get a feeling
[47:48] we get a pain
[47:50] we don't know what it is
[47:52] so we run to dr google
[47:56] are we like this
[47:59] oh
[48:00] and you know what we do we come up with
[48:02] a list
[48:03] based on our symptoms of about 30
[48:06] possibilities
[48:09] you know what they ought to put at the
[48:10] top of all of them old age
[48:14] good is wearing out
[48:16] that's part of what's wrong with us
[48:19] this old body here it was never meant to
[48:21] be here forever was it
[48:23] but there's a part of you hallelujah
[48:25] there's a part of you that'll never die
[48:28] we skip the top
[48:30] we skip the little things you know it
[48:32] could be it could be
[48:35] that you are sitting in a toxic
[48:37] environment
[48:38] it could be that you're putting
[48:40] chemicals all over your body destroying
[48:43] yourself it could be that we're eating
[48:46] hybrid food and changing the very
[48:48] physical form of our of our systems
[48:51] could be a lot of things but we skip all
[48:54] of that and we come down here to whoa
[48:59] oh i know honey i know what's wrong with
[49:02] me
[49:04] you're going to help me
[49:06] i'm going to keep pulling till you do
[49:08] i've got the big c
[49:10] why did you skip all the other
[49:12] possibilities
[49:14] because there's something in us that's
[49:16] attracted to the negative
[49:20] oh yes there's something in us we'd
[49:23] rather worry and stew
[49:26] and get all in a tither than to say i
[49:29] don't care what it is every bit of it is
[49:32] taken care of i'm standing on the
[49:35] promise of his word with his stripes i
[49:40] am healed i don't need a diagnosis to
[49:43] take god at his word whatever it is
[49:47] whatever it is
[49:49] he's the same
[49:51] yesterday
[49:52] today
[49:53] and forever
[49:55] so if dr google is producing fear
[49:59] in your life you need to let him go
[50:04] you need to trust the lord
[50:06] get you a physician if you want to that
[50:10] you can trust but don't try to
[50:12] self-diagnose
[50:15] fear is a hideous monster
[50:19] and it's something that should not be
[50:22] present in the life of a born-again
[50:25] believer we ought to be pulling fear
[50:27] down as fast as it exalts itself in our
[50:31] lives you don't even have to say amen
[50:34] because i know i'm telling you the truth
[50:36] this morning
[50:38] fear brings torment the bible said we
[50:40] just need a baptism in perfect love we
[50:44] just need to understand who it is that
[50:47] has loved us with such perfect love such
[50:51] perfection that we might begin to
[50:53] practice some of that with one another
[50:56] because in an atmosphere of perfect love
[51:00] oh my
[51:02] in an atmosphere of perfect love fear
[51:06] cannot exist
[51:08] neither can cancer
[51:10] neither can coronavirus
[51:13] neither can anything else that the enemy
[51:15] wants to throw against us
[51:17] hallelujah
[51:18] just a minute amen brother
[51:24] you know i would do that
[51:26] if i were sitting out there and you were
[51:28] up here
[51:29] and you said something true
[51:32] even if i didn't like you i'd say amen
[51:36] i can't help myself
[51:38] if i'm listening to the radio and i hear
[51:41] a preacher preach and i know his
[51:43] doctrine is so messed up i couldn't
[51:46] follow him but he says something that is
[51:48] true
[51:49] and there's something on the inside of
[51:52] me i can't help myself i just say hey
[51:56] man
[51:57] that's what brother branham said a
[51:59] thoroughbred will do
[52:02] when the word of god is spoken there's
[52:05] something in us that said hey
[52:07] that's who i am
[52:09] i'm not my symptoms this morning
[52:12] i'm not my mind battles this morning i'm
[52:15] a blood bought sanctified holy
[52:18] ghost-filled child of the living god
[52:22] being adopted as his son
[52:25] come on not walking in defeat
[52:28] but walking in victory
[52:31] you don't have to say anything
[52:33] but i can't help myself
[52:37] god has promised us victory
[52:39] over every one of our enemies
[52:42] every every one of the weapons
[52:45] that are formed against us including
[52:47] ourselves
[52:49] look folks it's not by chance
[52:51] that brother branham told us
[52:54] that the greatest battle
[52:56] ever fought
[52:58] would be a battle on the battlefield
[53:02] of the mind
[53:05] he wasn't talking to the church
[53:08] he was talking to the bride
[53:11] you and i
[53:12] are going to know if we haven't already
[53:15] we're going to know
[53:16] a mind battle a war
[53:20] in our mind the enemy is going to use
[53:22] emotions
[53:24] and he's going to use our will our
[53:28] reasonings and our affections
[53:31] our memories he's going to use our
[53:34] conscience he's going to use all of that
[53:36] to try to wage a war
[53:39] on our mind we're going to have to
[53:42] recognize who it is that's doing this
[53:46] we're going to have to make up our mind
[53:48] not to cooperate with him but to stand
[53:52] on the promise of god's word and we're
[53:55] going to have to consciously make the
[53:57] effort to pull down every thought and
[54:00] every imagination that exalts itself
[54:04] against the knowledge of jesus christ we
[54:08] have to diligently and consistently
[54:11] pull those lies down
[54:14] put them under our foot
[54:16] under the blood of jesus christ and tell
[54:19] the enemy you're not going to destroy me
[54:23] by destroying my mind
[54:26] hallelujah
[54:27] are you here
[54:31] the psalmist said
[54:37] excuse me
[54:38] in psalm
[54:40] 141
[54:42] and verse 3 he said set
[54:45] a watch
[54:47] o lord
[54:49] before my mouth
[54:52] keep
[54:53] the door
[54:55] of my lips
[54:57] let me tell you something you're you
[54:59] have to watch your thoughts
[55:01] because your thoughts become words
[55:05] and your words become paradigms of words
[55:10] meaning that you you get in a habit
[55:13] of thinking a certain way
[55:16] and it's like a snowball
[55:18] it just gets bigger and bigger and
[55:21] bigger
[55:21] until fear begins to take a hold of our
[55:24] lives we have to recognize that it
[55:28] doesn't start by watching our words it
[55:31] starts by watching our thoughts if you
[55:34] want to change your life if you want to
[55:37] change your situation you don't just do
[55:40] it by changing the spoken words that
[55:42] come out of your mouth but you start at
[55:45] the origin of all spoken words and that
[55:48] is you go all the way back to the mind
[55:51] and you say let me let me just give you
[55:53] an example before we move on
[55:56] i
[55:56] i'm just going crazy people say i'm just
[55:59] losing my mind
[56:04] my back is killing me
[56:08] is it really
[56:11] you say we didn't come to the tabernacle
[56:13] this morning to hear the power of
[56:16] positive thinking well i tell you it
[56:17] could help us all a little bit
[56:20] and as believers it's our message
[56:23] and if you think brother adam didn't
[56:25] didn't speak about thinking
[56:28] and how we ought to think you better go
[56:30] back and do some searching
[56:32] because you'll find out that brother
[56:34] branham was at least 25 years maybe 35
[56:38] years ahead of the science of
[56:41] epigenetics
[56:43] and he was preaching things about the
[56:46] brain and about the mind and about how
[56:49] the body obeys the thought process
[56:53] he was preaching things like that when
[56:56] science was still believing that you are
[57:00] forced to live with the brain that
[57:03] you're born with
[57:05] and brother branham was preaching under
[57:07] inspiration and he was telling people
[57:10] you can change your atmosphere
[57:13] by the words that come out of your mouth
[57:15] you're not just changing the atmosphere
[57:18] you're rewiring the synapses and
[57:21] circuits of your brain
[57:24] you change the very geography of your
[57:27] brain when you go back and begin to
[57:31] overwrite
[57:33] negative thoughts with the positive
[57:35] truth of god's word you're not only
[57:39] changing your spiritual environment and
[57:42] your emotional life but science says
[57:45] you're changing every cell
[57:47] in your body
[57:49] did you know every cell in your body
[57:52] listens to you
[57:54] it hears what you say
[57:57] and it perceives even what you think
[58:00] because you are you are joined together
[58:04] by a highway of nerves and of a blood
[58:07] system
[58:08] that carries
[58:10] even memory
[58:11] in your cells
[58:13] you are fearfully and wonderfully
[58:17] wondrously made we are living way below
[58:22] what we have been created to live in
[58:25] yes
[58:27] and one of the reasons why this word is
[58:29] so powerful this message is so powerful
[58:33] is because as things are getting darker
[58:36] out there and as things are eroding out
[58:40] there in here he's building a people
[58:44] with the power of his word that will not
[58:47] go the way of the world
[58:55] i want to see some of you
[59:02] praise the lord
[59:04] hallelujah
[59:06] we talk like we're on our last leg
[59:10] nobody no wonder nobody wants what we
[59:11] carry
[59:14] we're always dying
[59:16] come on now we don't have to be a people
[59:20] like that
[59:21] i'm not trying to make charismatics out
[59:23] of us i'm trying to make bible believers
[59:26] out of us
[59:27] just take god at his word
[59:30] somebody said but i don't feel better
[59:37] well i'll tell you what he said
[59:39] he said even if you don't feel healed
[59:42] just go forth i am healed
[59:46] i am healed i am healed i am healed i am
[59:49] healed he said it
[59:51] he said until you believe what you're
[59:53] saying
[59:54] did you know church you don't even have
[59:57] to believe it the first dozen times you
[59:59] say it
[1:00:00] you just say it because you know it's
[1:00:02] right
[1:00:03] because you know it's the word and you
[1:00:05] keep repeating that
[1:00:07] yes sir
[1:00:09] you keep repeating that and finally
[1:00:12] something in you begins to kick in
[1:00:15] there's a seed inside of you
[1:00:18] how many of you are carrying a royal
[1:00:20] seed whoa
[1:00:21] i might get excited by myself i am
[1:00:25] carrying a royal seed
[1:00:28] and when i begin to declare the truth of
[1:00:32] god's word that seed is awakened in me
[1:00:37] and it's that seed is there to join my
[1:00:40] body with my confession
[1:00:44] whoo
[1:00:46] sure
[1:00:47] we have a lot of problems
[1:00:49] but we've got a great big capable god
[1:00:52] and a lot of times we're the weapon
[1:00:55] that's been formed against our own life
[1:00:58] and if we resign
[1:01:00] if we make up our minds today i'm not
[1:01:03] going to be the weapon
[1:01:06] i'm going to refuse to put my hands
[1:01:09] to put my life
[1:01:11] in the hand of the very one who wants to
[1:01:14] destroy me
[1:01:16] can i tell you something
[1:01:18] the enemy wants to kill you
[1:01:21] and he not only wants to kill you he
[1:01:24] wants to destroy everything good about
[1:01:26] you
[1:01:27] and he wants you to live out the rest of
[1:01:30] your life on planet earth in insanity
[1:01:35] he's driving people crazy
[1:01:38] out there
[1:01:40] but the bible said great peace
[1:01:44] great peace have they
[1:01:46] which love the law of god
[1:01:49] come on now and and nothing shall offend
[1:01:52] them
[1:01:54] and he said he said i will keep those
[1:01:58] in perfect peace
[1:02:00] whose
[1:02:01] who's what
[1:02:02] whose mind
[1:02:04] is stayed on
[1:02:06] me
[1:02:08] it's not easy but it's worth it
[1:02:10] hallelujah
[1:02:12] so i want to i want to give you a few
[1:02:14] examples here
[1:02:15] because so far you're kind of looking
[1:02:17] like i'm preaching to
[1:02:19] another church
[1:02:23] but i'm preaching to us
[1:02:26] i preach to myself like this all the
[1:02:28] time
[1:02:30] and if i don't do it i have a wife
[1:02:33] and four
[1:02:34] children
[1:02:36] now i know they don't look like children
[1:02:39] but they'll always be our babies
[1:02:41] and if i if i don't practice what i
[1:02:44] preach
[1:02:46] sometimes they beat the holy ghost
[1:02:49] before he has a chance to correct me
[1:02:52] they will
[1:02:54] they'll say now dad that don't sound
[1:02:55] like what you're pre that sounds like
[1:02:57] negative thoughts to me
[1:03:00] you got to reign that in and you know i
[1:03:02] don't resent that
[1:03:04] for two reasons number one i'm like
[1:03:06] anybody else i need to be reminded and
[1:03:09] number two it lets me know they're
[1:03:10] listening
[1:03:14] faith comes by hearing
[1:03:17] and hearing by the word of god so i want
[1:03:18] to give you three examples this morning
[1:03:21] of how you can be the enemy you can be
[1:03:24] the weapon
[1:03:25] this is three ways that you can be the
[1:03:28] weapon formed against yourself so you
[1:03:30] want to understand this and then you
[1:03:32] want to do as brother branham said you
[1:03:34] want to move in another spirit
[1:03:37] that's a powerful teaching he gave us
[1:03:40] on moving in the opposite spirit
[1:03:44] when you sense that the enemy is trying
[1:03:46] to move in
[1:03:47] your life in a certain way
[1:03:49] you want to defeat that enemy then you
[1:03:51] just have to start moving in the
[1:03:54] opposite of what he's trying to
[1:03:55] accomplish in you anybody with me
[1:03:58] well let's give one example here being
[1:04:00] stingy
[1:04:01] the enemy would like to cause you to be
[1:04:03] selfish
[1:04:08] he'd like for all of us to be selfish
[1:04:11] and to be stingy
[1:04:13] and and protect ourselves and forget
[1:04:16] about everybody else but there's a way
[1:04:18] to overcome that devil
[1:04:20] you just make up your mind i'm going to
[1:04:22] be generous
[1:04:24] i'm going to give to the kingdom of god
[1:04:26] and i'm going to give to god's people
[1:04:29] and i'm not going to be overcome by a
[1:04:32] spirit of greed or a spirit of
[1:04:35] selfishness and you just watch what'll
[1:04:38] happen it'll be hard the first time you
[1:04:41] do it
[1:04:42] so let me encourage you
[1:04:44] always bless the household of faith
[1:04:47] those who are of the same faith as you
[1:04:50] you should certainly remember to help
[1:04:52] them in their struggles
[1:04:55] but you'll never completely break that
[1:04:57] spirit as long as you're doing for
[1:05:00] someone who can say thank you
[1:05:06] because they're still just a little bit
[1:05:08] of pride that gets in there sometime
[1:05:10] and you'd like to have someone to thank
[1:05:12] you for what you've done
[1:05:14] so you know what i have to do if i feel
[1:05:16] that thing getting on me
[1:05:17] i have to do something for a stranger
[1:05:22] i go through the drive-through sometime
[1:05:24] and i say i want to pay for the person
[1:05:25] behind me
[1:05:26] and secretly i'm kind of praying lord i
[1:05:28] hope they don't have 15 children in that
[1:05:30] van
[1:05:34] sometimes you just have to learn to do
[1:05:37] for people who can't ever pay you back
[1:05:40] who can ever even say thank you
[1:05:44] but you do it because you recognize how
[1:05:46] he has given how he has blessed how he
[1:05:50] has prospered your life
[1:05:52] now i gave that as an example because
[1:05:55] there's a way to get out from under any
[1:05:57] kind of spirit that the enemy is using
[1:05:59] against your life you discover what
[1:06:02] would be opposite of that
[1:06:04] and you start pushing back against the
[1:06:07] enemy i'll just show you
[1:06:10] come on now
[1:06:11] somebody said i don't want to be that
[1:06:13] involved with him
[1:06:14] well let me tell you something he's ever
[1:06:16] present in our life
[1:06:18] he's out for this bride
[1:06:21] and she's on to him hallelujah and we're
[1:06:24] going to quit cooperating with him as he
[1:06:27] tries to form a weapon against our lives
[1:06:30] number one here's one of the ways
[1:06:33] by holding on
[1:06:35] to stinking thinking
[1:06:38] i want you to say that stinking thinking
[1:06:42] stinking thinking
[1:06:45] if you
[1:06:46] are all the time
[1:06:49] thinking
[1:06:50] negative thoughts
[1:06:53] and engaging
[1:06:55] negative
[1:06:56] thought
[1:06:57] process and paradigms
[1:07:00] the enemy
[1:07:02] will use your own mind
[1:07:05] as a weapon to strike you down
[1:07:08] you've got to possess the reins of your
[1:07:10] mind
[1:07:11] you're the bride of jesus christ
[1:07:13] the prophet of god tells us by the
[1:07:15] scripture we're not going to get the
[1:07:17] mind of christ
[1:07:20] we have the mind of christ
[1:07:23] we have a choice to make
[1:07:25] will we continue to function out of our
[1:07:28] own mind or will we utilize the gift
[1:07:32] that has been given to the believer and
[1:07:34] that is the ability to function with the
[1:07:36] mind of christ if you're with me say
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:40] proverbs 23 and 7 let's go there quickly
[1:07:43] for as he thinketh
[1:07:47] in his heart
[1:07:49] what's the rest
[1:07:51] so
[1:07:52] is
[1:07:54] he
[1:07:55] that's it
[1:07:56] that's it
[1:07:58] you are what you think
[1:08:00] i'm not trying to preach this like
[1:08:02] norman vincent peale
[1:08:04] i'm trying to bring this to the message
[1:08:06] of the hour
[1:08:07] i'm trying to remind you of what brother
[1:08:09] branham is i'll show you in just a
[1:08:10] moment what he has told us
[1:08:12] now that word thinketh
[1:08:15] that's a word in hebrew
[1:08:17] and it doesn't mean the kind of thought
[1:08:20] that just passes through
[1:08:23] your mind
[1:08:25] did you know your brain is so designed
[1:08:29] that you can think a new thought
[1:08:32] and if you don't ever go back
[1:08:36] and remind yourself of that thought
[1:08:40] that thought will disappear
[1:08:42] that synapsis is broken
[1:08:45] and it never moves further down into
[1:08:49] your brain to the hippocampus of the
[1:08:52] brain
[1:08:53] that thought never moves
[1:08:56] farther into the brain in fact it just
[1:09:00] leaves you
[1:09:03] like a
[1:09:04] poof now let me tell you something else
[1:09:07] that means you can hear a sermon
[1:09:12] if you don't ever go back and hear that
[1:09:14] again
[1:09:16] i don't know why you're making all those
[1:09:18] notes
[1:09:22] what are you doing that to stay awake
[1:09:24] why are you making all those notes
[1:09:26] we have people in our church i'll tell
[1:09:28] you i'm a nosy person don't leave your
[1:09:30] notebook laying around my church
[1:09:34] i'm there all week
[1:09:35] i'm there five six days a week
[1:09:38] if i see a notebook laying there i'm
[1:09:40] thinking i'm going to just see
[1:09:43] i'm just going to pick that oh brother i
[1:09:44] can't believe you do that i i know it's
[1:09:46] terrible but i've done it i've done it
[1:09:49] and some people have
[1:09:51] just about written my sermon verbatim
[1:09:56] i'm thinking oh my
[1:09:58] i could have printed my notes and give
[1:10:00] them to you and saved you the effort but
[1:10:03] here's the problem what'd they do they
[1:10:05] left it at church
[1:10:11] wasted their effort
[1:10:14] that's never going to do you any good if
[1:10:16] you don't go back and read it again
[1:10:19] when you're hearing brother branham and
[1:10:21] you're making notes there if you let
[1:10:23] some of that just pass through you and
[1:10:25] you don't ever go back and revisit a
[1:10:28] thought and dig a little bit did you
[1:10:30] know it's not just preachers that need
[1:10:32] to dig in the word
[1:10:34] hello
[1:10:35] we we've got to have that word in us to
[1:10:38] give us what we need to overcome
[1:10:40] so if you don't ever go back and revisit
[1:10:43] a new thought
[1:10:45] it's like a puff of energy
[1:10:50] it just leaves you
[1:10:52] this is not just make-believe this is
[1:10:56] scientifically but if you go back and
[1:10:59] revisit that thought
[1:11:01] and you mull over that thought and you
[1:11:03] meditate on that thought
[1:11:05] and you give that thought more than 60
[1:11:07] seconds of attention
[1:11:10] that thought becomes
[1:11:12] a part of who you are
[1:11:16] that thought is driven
[1:11:18] farther into the deeper recesses of the
[1:11:21] brain and you can pull that thought back
[1:11:24] any time you want to
[1:11:26] now here's the problem your brain does
[1:11:29] not immediately discern whether you're
[1:11:32] having a positive thought or a negative
[1:11:34] thought
[1:11:37] how many times do we revisit negative
[1:11:39] thoughts
[1:11:42] i'm going to give you
[1:11:44] looking at you precious people you don't
[1:11:46] look like you've ever had a negative
[1:11:48] thought in your life
[1:11:52] except jordan
[1:11:56] because he's human
[1:12:01] let me give you some examples here
[1:12:04] let me find them i didn't know i'd have
[1:12:05] to prove myself
[1:12:07] give me just a moment i want to give you
[1:12:09] a few
[1:12:10] these are called ants
[1:12:13] ants
[1:12:16] automatic
[1:12:18] negative
[1:12:20] thoughts
[1:12:21] ants
[1:12:22] the reason why they become automatic is
[1:12:25] because you've revisited those thoughts
[1:12:27] so many times
[1:12:29] that they have floated down to the
[1:12:31] deeper recesses of the brain and they've
[1:12:33] become a part of the dendrites and this
[1:12:36] is so powerful because science
[1:12:39] has been able now to take pictures based
[1:12:43] on energy in your brain
[1:12:46] and they have been able to capture i
[1:12:49] don't have all that with me
[1:12:50] but they have been able to capture a
[1:12:53] negative thought in the brain
[1:12:58] it's amazing
[1:13:00] through resonance technology
[1:13:02] and it looks like brother
[1:13:05] aaron it looks like an old twisted up
[1:13:08] gnarled
[1:13:09] tree
[1:13:11] branches all entwined around one another
[1:13:15] and
[1:13:16] and very very spooky looking
[1:13:19] whereas
[1:13:21] when they're able to capture a positive
[1:13:24] thought process
[1:13:26] it looks like a healthy
[1:13:30] fruit producing tree
[1:13:32] in the brain i think that's outstanding
[1:13:36] so what we're doing is we're building a
[1:13:39] a gnarled up forest an old twisted up
[1:13:42] forest in our brain
[1:13:44] when we begin and listen you only have
[1:13:47] so much capacity
[1:13:50] you don't want to fill up your brain
[1:13:52] capacity with only things that are
[1:13:54] negative and no good
[1:13:56] this is why the bible tells us
[1:13:58] whatsoever things are lovely
[1:14:00] whatsoever things of virtuous and of
[1:14:02] good report think think
[1:14:06] think on these things
[1:14:09] because if we fill up our brain with
[1:14:12] politics
[1:14:23] let me tell you something we're not of
[1:14:25] the elephant
[1:14:28] and we're not of the donkey
[1:14:31] we're of the lamb
[1:14:36] if you let that old donkey and that old
[1:14:39] elephant get in your head you won't have
[1:14:42] room
[1:14:43] to fill up your life with light and
[1:14:45] bright
[1:14:46] and holy and sacred and virtuous
[1:14:49] and valuable and precious and sacred oh
[1:14:52] my
[1:14:53] so we have to watch that now what
[1:14:56] happens is we think these negative
[1:14:58] thoughts so often
[1:15:00] that they become automatic
[1:15:03] and there are triggers
[1:15:06] you can see a person
[1:15:09] whoa
[1:15:10] we're about to get tight here
[1:15:13] you can see a person and the memory of
[1:15:16] that person
[1:15:18] it happens to me every time i come to
[1:15:20] tucson and i see old friends
[1:15:23] i can go down a journey of negative
[1:15:25] thoughts and think about things that
[1:15:27] they did to me through the years that
[1:15:29] were not so pretty and nice
[1:15:31] or i can make a choice
[1:15:33] and i can say neither of us are who we
[1:15:36] were then
[1:15:40] let me tell you something you're going
[1:15:42] to have to be like the prophet told us
[1:15:44] with your crayon and you're going to
[1:15:46] have to keep drawing people back in
[1:15:48] until finally they give up on trying to
[1:15:50] get rid of you
[1:15:53] just tell them i'm here to stay
[1:15:56] i found my tribe and i'm not going
[1:15:59] anywhere and you and i are going to have
[1:16:01] to forget
[1:16:02] what's in the past
[1:16:04] if we repent and we apologize and we go
[1:16:08] on then it's like sister minnie peterson
[1:16:11] wrote
[1:16:13] oh praise the lord
[1:16:15] it's jesus that i see
[1:16:19] the son of god revealed
[1:16:22] in you and me
[1:16:23] i thank god i'm part of the family
[1:16:27] where the people are what
[1:16:30] perfect
[1:16:31] you ever heard this song
[1:16:34] well i've heard it
[1:16:36] i'm so old
[1:16:39] that i can look over there and see
[1:16:41] them singing it
[1:16:44] i can see sister many standing there
[1:16:48] singing it with the girls
[1:16:52] don't speak evil of your brother here's
[1:16:54] the verse
[1:16:56] don't speak evil of your brother lest
[1:16:57] you speak evil of the law for we know
[1:17:00] the law is perfect without a single flaw
[1:17:02] as long as your brother's repented for
[1:17:05] the wrong that he has done
[1:17:07] then your brother is as perfect
[1:17:11] i wish you'd help me
[1:17:13] then your brother is as perfect as
[1:17:14] perfect can be oh praise the lord it's
[1:17:17] jesus that i see how many of you believe
[1:17:19] with a little bit of practice we could
[1:17:21] see jesus in one another
[1:17:23] instead of always remembering the
[1:17:25] negative of how someone mistreated you
[1:17:28] or did you wrong
[1:17:29] we must take possession of the real
[1:17:32] estate of our thoughts
[1:17:34] we must take possession of what we think
[1:17:38] i want to give you an example some
[1:17:40] examples here of automatic negative
[1:17:42] thoughts
[1:17:43] that you've never been guilty of i know
[1:17:48] i want to preface this by saying i am
[1:17:51] reading a list
[1:17:53] i refuse to let these be
[1:17:56] my thoughts
[1:17:58] these are not my thoughts
[1:18:00] i'm reading a list
[1:18:02] and i'm notifying my brain
[1:18:06] that these are not my thoughts
[1:18:08] somebody said what in the world are you
[1:18:10] doing here
[1:18:11] did you know that in your subconscious
[1:18:15] you your brain your body
[1:18:18] doesn't know whether you're joking or
[1:18:20] not
[1:18:24] so you might say something over your
[1:18:26] life that's a joke
[1:18:29] but your brain was not able to discern
[1:18:31] in the subconscious level whether you
[1:18:33] were joking or whether you meant it
[1:18:36] and so if you jokingly say i'm just
[1:18:39] stupid
[1:18:42] the cells of your body according to
[1:18:45] epigenetics and the study of the brain
[1:18:48] your your cells are not able to discern
[1:18:52] that you're just joking
[1:18:55] and you just pronounced something over
[1:18:57] every cell of your body i'm a loser
[1:19:02] i'm stupid
[1:19:04] i'm crazy i'm losing my mind
[1:19:09] i can't take anymore
[1:19:13] he or she is such an idiot
[1:19:17] i can't believe they're so stupid
[1:19:20] this is a list
[1:19:22] this is terrible this is horrible i
[1:19:26] can't stand this
[1:19:28] i should be able to handle this other
[1:19:30] people can
[1:19:32] he makes me so
[1:19:34] mad you know what the problem with that
[1:19:37] is
[1:19:38] that has a greater effect on your body
[1:19:42] than it does on the one you got angry
[1:19:43] with
[1:19:45] did you know when you speak words of
[1:19:46] anger
[1:19:48] your body goes into a
[1:19:50] hormonal storm
[1:19:54] it's true
[1:19:56] your body starts producing chemicals
[1:19:59] sometimes referred to as as fight or
[1:20:03] flight
[1:20:05] and there is a problem in today's
[1:20:07] society in today's health world there's
[1:20:10] a problem because so many people
[1:20:13] never completely reset
[1:20:17] and they live their life under the the
[1:20:20] hormonal and chemical wash
[1:20:24] of fight or flight
[1:20:27] and it's very very dangerous to every
[1:20:30] system of your body to live in that and
[1:20:32] you are signaling
[1:20:35] this kind of uh of situation in your
[1:20:38] body when you speak angry words
[1:20:42] and so we've got to watch our words
[1:20:45] and in order to do that we've got to
[1:20:47] watch our thoughts
[1:20:48] i got to read on because
[1:20:51] we're not moving fast enough
[1:20:53] i can't believe this is happening to me
[1:20:56] murphy's law does anybody know that
[1:20:59] whoo if anything can go wrong
[1:21:05] it will go wrong
[1:21:08] if anything bad is going to happen to
[1:21:10] anybody it's going to happen to me
[1:21:12] come on you ever said things like that
[1:21:16] you may have thought it was just a
[1:21:18] passing blurb or just a joke
[1:21:21] but the cells of your body didn't know
[1:21:23] that
[1:21:24] and you put your body in a hormonal
[1:21:28] storm when you spoke that over your life
[1:21:32] and i want you to know something this is
[1:21:34] part of the reason why there's such
[1:21:36] disease in the world today
[1:21:39] let me give you that statistic since
[1:21:41] you're quiet
[1:21:42] let me give you that statistic here
[1:21:45] there are three t's
[1:21:47] that are mostly responsible for disease
[1:21:52] the number one cause is thoughts
[1:21:58] scientists don't completely agree on the
[1:22:00] numbers
[1:22:03] so i'll give you the range
[1:22:06] they say from 75 to 98
[1:22:11] of disease
[1:22:14] current mental physical emotion and
[1:22:17] behavioral illnesses today come from
[1:22:21] your thought
[1:22:23] life
[1:22:25] i tell you that's staggering
[1:22:28] the other is
[1:22:29] toxins number two and trauma
[1:22:32] number three meaning you've had some
[1:22:34] traumatic experience the death of a
[1:22:36] loved one a terrible accident
[1:22:39] these kinds of things produce disease or
[1:22:42] disease in the body and so from 2 to 25
[1:22:47] of all disease
[1:22:49] is caused from toxins and trauma while
[1:22:52] 75 to 98
[1:22:54] of all disease is caused from your
[1:22:57] thought life do you realize that if
[1:22:59] that's true if that's true you can
[1:23:02] change your health situation by changing
[1:23:05] your thoughts
[1:23:06] why don't we give it a try
[1:23:08] anybody willing to give it a try
[1:23:11] i'm willing to give it a try
[1:23:14] let me go back to my list just a moment
[1:23:16] i want to hurry i know my time is
[1:23:19] limited but i also know i'm we're not
[1:23:21] leaving before 12 o'clock either
[1:23:25] people can't change
[1:23:28] you ever speak something like that
[1:23:30] people can't change i'm useless i'm no
[1:23:33] good i'm bad i'm a failure i'll never
[1:23:35] get another job
[1:23:38] you will if you'll get off the couch
[1:23:42] you will if you'll do what brother sings
[1:23:44] to us every year pick up a shovel
[1:23:48] and dig another well
[1:23:50] you shouldn't speak that
[1:23:52] you should speak what god's word tells
[1:23:55] us
[1:23:56] god has a job for my life
[1:23:59] he has a job for me to be able to
[1:24:02] prepare and and provide for my family
[1:24:05] and i'm not going to let the enemy lock
[1:24:08] me in my bedroom at home lamenting
[1:24:11] because i don't have a job i'm going to
[1:24:13] ask the lord to lead me
[1:24:15] and guide me
[1:24:17] come on
[1:24:19] i'm not a good dad
[1:24:21] i'm not a good mom don't say that
[1:24:24] don't say it
[1:24:25] don't speak that
[1:24:27] your cells will follow your profession
[1:24:30] your body will obey your confession
[1:24:33] your life will follow what you think and
[1:24:36] say
[1:24:37] don't say that
[1:24:39] say by the grace of god i'm going to be
[1:24:43] a better mom
[1:24:44] i'm going to do better as a dad for my
[1:24:47] children
[1:24:49] i'm worthless let me tell you something
[1:24:51] you are not worthless
[1:24:54] you're the most valuable thing on planet
[1:24:56] earth today
[1:24:58] somebody said how could you say that
[1:25:00] because he shed his blood
[1:25:04] he shed the most precious thing that
[1:25:07] there ever has been his life's blood was
[1:25:11] shed to purchase you
[1:25:14] and if you would have been the only
[1:25:16] sinner
[1:25:17] he would have died and shed his blood
[1:25:21] for you
[1:25:22] he didn't do that to buy
[1:25:24] junk he did that to buy something of
[1:25:28] great value
[1:25:30] and now because his life is in you
[1:25:33] you're the most valuable
[1:25:35] uh walking talking living entity on
[1:25:39] planet earth
[1:25:41] don't speak that over your life i'm not
[1:25:43] a nice person
[1:25:47] the way folks are acting is as though
[1:25:50] you've never thought these things or
[1:25:52] said any of these things i'm glad i know
[1:25:54] better
[1:25:55] nobody likes me
[1:25:59] nobody will speak to me
[1:26:02] i'm not popular
[1:26:04] i'll never be good at any of any of that
[1:26:07] why does this always happen to me
[1:26:10] this is the worst thing that could have
[1:26:11] ever happened
[1:26:12] i'll never be able to learn this
[1:26:15] i'll never get better
[1:26:17] i'm not bright enough
[1:26:19] the worst always happens to me this
[1:26:22] won't work out
[1:26:24] i never get things right
[1:26:26] the problems i'm having now will go on
[1:26:29] forever and the list goes on
[1:26:33] because this is not a list that's
[1:26:35] compiled of only things sinners think
[1:26:38] and say
[1:26:39] but we are guilty sometimes
[1:26:43] of focusing on these things
[1:26:45] let me show you what brother branham
[1:26:47] said about
[1:26:48] it he gave us some powerful powerful
[1:26:52] things
[1:26:54] it's real simple just very simple
[1:26:56] in the message testimony
[1:26:59] raising the dead boy in 1953
[1:27:02] west palm beach florida
[1:27:04] is everybody awake
[1:27:07] here's an old slogan
[1:27:09] paragraph eight
[1:27:11] here's an old slogan i want you to
[1:27:13] remember it this is brother branham
[1:27:15] do right
[1:27:18] that's your duty to god
[1:27:21] think right
[1:27:22] that's your duty
[1:27:25] to yourself
[1:27:28] and you're bound to be right
[1:27:32] he said see you'll come out right if
[1:27:34] you'll do right
[1:27:36] that's your duty to god think right
[1:27:38] that's your duty to yourself and you'll
[1:27:41] come out right
[1:27:43] so let's put that in the right order
[1:27:45] think right
[1:27:48] that's your duty to yourself
[1:27:51] do
[1:27:51] right
[1:27:52] that's your duty to god
[1:27:55] and then you'll be right
[1:27:57] because if your thoughts are right
[1:28:00] your behavior
[1:28:02] your actions will follow your thoughts
[1:28:05] and you will be pleasing god
[1:28:08] if you concentrate on
[1:28:10] god-pleasing thoughts
[1:28:13] you will focus on god-pleasing behavior
[1:28:17] come on now and then you can't lose
[1:28:20] you just simply can't lose
[1:28:23] well there's so many things here
[1:28:25] that he said
[1:28:27] there are certain people that have what
[1:28:29] we call a negativity bias
[1:28:34] and it's usually a product of their
[1:28:36] environment in their upbringing
[1:28:39] and they are those who will will say
[1:28:42] always
[1:28:44] that the cup is half empty
[1:28:47] because they just don't seem to see that
[1:28:49] water in there
[1:28:52] it's really sad
[1:28:54] they have thought that way so long
[1:28:57] they have programmed their brain
[1:29:01] and the truth is when they it's truth
[1:29:04] it's not it's not just some kind of
[1:29:06] hocus pocus the truth is they have
[1:29:09] programmed their brain so long
[1:29:12] that when they see that they see the
[1:29:14] empty first
[1:29:16] they really are not seeing this
[1:29:18] their mind focuses on the empty and they
[1:29:22] will they will call this a half empty
[1:29:25] glass
[1:29:26] you and i who practice
[1:29:29] and work hard
[1:29:30] to see things a little more positive we
[1:29:33] see the water before we see the empty we
[1:29:35] see the empty
[1:29:37] we know someone cheated us
[1:29:42] we know the waitress didn't pour a full
[1:29:44] glass
[1:29:46] but we see the
[1:29:47] the the volume that's there
[1:29:50] before we see the empty spot
[1:29:53] now you can retrain your brain
[1:29:56] thank god
[1:29:57] thank god
[1:29:59] we can retrain our brain so that we we
[1:30:02] lose our negativity bias
[1:30:05] let me give you let me give you this
[1:30:07] here just so you will will understand if
[1:30:10] someone has
[1:30:11] a negativity bias
[1:30:14] their mind is like velcro
[1:30:17] to a negative thought
[1:30:19] a negative thought comes passing through
[1:30:22] and and it's like their mind just
[1:30:24] catches that
[1:30:26] and pulls it in
[1:30:28] someone who doesn't have a negativity
[1:30:30] bias their mind is more like
[1:30:32] teflon and when that thought comes by it
[1:30:36] just slides right out they don't ever go
[1:30:38] back and revisit that again i want to
[1:30:40] tell you something that's the kind of
[1:30:42] brain i want that's the kind of mind the
[1:30:44] mind of christ is
[1:30:46] hello
[1:30:47] when when the enemy comes with all the
[1:30:49] gloom
[1:30:51] and all the glum
[1:30:53] and the doom
[1:30:55] and we don't know what we're going to do
[1:30:58] somebody said could it get any worse
[1:31:00] don't say something so so bad
[1:31:05] the possibility out there is endless
[1:31:08] but we are not focusing on out there
[1:31:12] we're keeping our hearts and minds in
[1:31:16] here
[1:31:18] your thoughts create your mood let me
[1:31:20] tell you something you know any moody
[1:31:21] people
[1:31:23] wait a minute i want to i want to slow
[1:31:24] down here
[1:31:26] does anybody know any moody people
[1:31:28] anybody sitting beside moody person
[1:31:32] we can have argument we can really i can
[1:31:34] get husbands and wives to fuss all the
[1:31:36] way to lunch
[1:31:40] you know negative people
[1:31:43] sometimes they call them negative
[1:31:44] nancy's i said oh no don't put
[1:31:46] somebody's name on there because then
[1:31:48] their nancies will hear that and they'll
[1:31:50] think that they have to be that way
[1:31:52] but it's absolutely uh
[1:31:54] the truth that you don't have to be that
[1:31:56] way at all
[1:31:58] so so negative
[1:32:01] but we are told in in brain science in
[1:32:04] epigenetics that
[1:32:06] if we purpose to think on things that
[1:32:10] are more uh virtuous and are more
[1:32:13] positive and more valuable that it makes
[1:32:16] such an important difference in our body
[1:32:18] now this is just one study
[1:32:22] men who believed
[1:32:25] their risk
[1:32:27] of suffering from cardiovascular disease
[1:32:30] was lower than average
[1:32:33] they believed it
[1:32:35] the doctor gave them statistic
[1:32:38] and they believed
[1:32:40] that they were in a subset group
[1:32:44] who were three times less likely to have
[1:32:47] cardiovascular disease those men
[1:32:51] were three times less likely to die from
[1:32:54] a heart attack or a stroke
[1:32:57] than men who believed otherwise
[1:33:00] it was a 15-year study out of the
[1:33:03] university of rochester medical center
[1:33:06] the researcher's name was robert
[1:33:08] gremling
[1:33:10] almost every cancer doctor
[1:33:13] that has been interviewed
[1:33:16] will answer this way
[1:33:18] when i have a patient
[1:33:21] that looks at a cancer diagnosis as the
[1:33:24] end it almost always is
[1:33:30] but when i have a patient who says
[1:33:33] that's tough news doc
[1:33:36] but i'm placing my
[1:33:38] my life
[1:33:40] in the hands of a greater power
[1:33:43] i trust a living god
[1:33:45] and i'm going to focus on his word
[1:33:49] come on now they don't all use spiritual
[1:33:51] language
[1:33:53] sometimes they'll say i'm a man of faith
[1:33:55] i'm a woman of faith i'm a spiritual
[1:33:58] person
[1:33:59] almost every cancer doctor
[1:34:02] that was interviewed says that person
[1:34:05] has
[1:34:06] 50 to 75
[1:34:08] chance
[1:34:10] of defeating even stage 4
[1:34:14] cancer
[1:34:16] one doctor said that he had had 300
[1:34:20] patients come back from stage five
[1:34:25] half of them
[1:34:26] melanoma
[1:34:29] come on
[1:34:31] why because they chose
[1:34:34] to think about
[1:34:36] what they were thinking about
[1:34:39] you've got a greater weapon than
[1:34:40] positive thoughts
[1:34:44] what did he say it
[1:34:47] is
[1:34:49] written
[1:34:51] he used the word of god
[1:34:54] nothing is more contagious than
[1:34:56] negativity
[1:34:57] the enemy is constantly trying to
[1:34:59] disturb our peace with all of these
[1:35:02] negative thoughts but we have power we
[1:35:05] have power over that we take god at his
[1:35:07] word we pull those thoughts down and we
[1:35:11] meditate and focus
[1:35:13] on the on the truth of his word
[1:35:16] number two
[1:35:19] this is another way you can be the
[1:35:20] weapon formed against your life
[1:35:23] by carrying offense
[1:35:28] by holding on to a grudge
[1:35:32] it's absolutely time
[1:35:34] to let it go
[1:35:38] it's easy for you to say they say
[1:35:41] it's not easy for anyone to do that
[1:35:44] it takes an effort
[1:35:46] but if you could realize that you are
[1:35:48] affecting not only your spiritual life
[1:35:52] but you are affecting your mental life
[1:35:56] and your physical life
[1:35:58] by holding on to a grudge and seeking
[1:36:00] vengeance
[1:36:01] it's destroying your body from the
[1:36:04] inside out and this is not the heritage
[1:36:06] of the servants of the lord
[1:36:08] the heritage of the servants of the lord
[1:36:10] is to rise above every weapon that is
[1:36:12] formed against us and to constantly be
[1:36:15] dressed in the righteousness of jesus
[1:36:17] christ
[1:36:18] that root of bitterness
[1:36:25] will destroy you
[1:36:29] in a message the 10 virgins and the 144
[1:36:32] thousand
[1:36:34] brother branham said in paragraph
[1:36:36] 71 he said oh
[1:36:39] not that constant burden for the lost
[1:36:43] that sweetness
[1:36:46] he said don't ever let anything rise up
[1:36:49] and put bitterness in your soul
[1:36:52] no matter how bad anyone ever treats you
[1:36:54] or anything don't never don't be guilty
[1:36:57] of letting that thing anchor
[1:37:00] in your soul
[1:37:02] listen
[1:37:03] it'll grieve the holy spirit
[1:37:06] away
[1:37:08] from you
[1:37:10] it certainly
[1:37:11] will
[1:37:14] how many of you believe it
[1:37:16] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:37:18] paragraph 86
[1:37:20] brother branham said if the brother
[1:37:23] you think he's a little wrong
[1:37:26] or is the sister
[1:37:28] say lord don't let me never have the
[1:37:31] root of bitterness spring up
[1:37:34] because it'll affect
[1:37:36] him
[1:37:43] and it'll take the christ
[1:37:46] right out of your life
[1:37:49] you see the root of bitterness
[1:37:51] that you you you show or treat someone
[1:37:54] else
[1:37:55] based on the root of bitterness it has
[1:37:56] an effect on their life
[1:37:59] but it will mess you up it'll grieve the
[1:38:02] holy spirit away help me help me
[1:38:05] it'll take christ out of your life
[1:38:08] brother branham said that poison acid of
[1:38:11] malice and jealousy and
[1:38:14] hatred that'll just take the holy spirit
[1:38:17] right away from you it will run him from
[1:38:19] the tabernacle here
[1:38:22] it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it
[1:38:24] away from here it'll hurt your pastor
[1:38:27] it'll do everything see don't you do
[1:38:29] that
[1:38:30] and then he tells us how not to be that
[1:38:33] weapon
[1:38:34] he said you just wax that much closer
[1:38:37] together
[1:38:41] what an appropriate word
[1:38:44] with the storms that you have weathered
[1:38:46] these past years
[1:38:49] with all that you have been through as a
[1:38:50] body of believers
[1:38:53] the key to continuing
[1:38:55] to not only
[1:38:56] survive but thrive
[1:39:00] it's my
[1:39:01] it's my burden my desire my thoughts
[1:39:05] that god doesn't just want to keep the
[1:39:07] tucson tabernacle
[1:39:09] surviving
[1:39:13] but he wants it to thrive
[1:39:18] i know there are people who believe that
[1:39:21] we've seen our best days
[1:39:25] but they're looking at it
[1:39:27] as the world looks at things
[1:39:30] because if you're looking at the nature
[1:39:32] of god god is the very opposite of
[1:39:34] what's going on out there in the world
[1:39:36] in the world things will get bigger
[1:39:38] bigger bigger bigger bigger greater
[1:39:40] beauty wonderful and then they're gone
[1:39:42] they just start fizzling fizzling out
[1:39:45] but in god in god's kingdom in god's
[1:39:48] economy
[1:39:49] the latter
[1:39:56] it's just a moment i gotta wipe all this
[1:39:57] sweat out of my eyes
[1:40:08] the glory of the latter house
[1:40:11] was always greater
[1:40:14] than the glory of the former house
[1:40:16] it's not in the nature and character of
[1:40:19] god to let things
[1:40:20] rise and then fizzle
[1:40:24] at rapture time
[1:40:26] it would be more like god
[1:40:29] more in his divine character and and
[1:40:32] looking at where god has
[1:40:34] been helps us see where god is today
[1:40:38] and it seems to me like it would more be
[1:40:42] the mind of god and the will of god for
[1:40:45] this place to live
[1:40:47] and thrive to the glory of god
[1:40:51] silence the naysayers
[1:40:54] anybody with me
[1:40:56] silence the naysayers and shut down uh
[1:41:00] all the same ballads
[1:41:02] i might get real personal here
[1:41:05] i've been known to do that
[1:41:08] i'd like to see every sun ballad uh uh
[1:41:11] all those tobiases and all of those who
[1:41:14] who have so much to say i'd like to see
[1:41:16] their words fall to the ground
[1:41:19] i'd like to see jesus come
[1:41:22] and show
[1:41:24] himself powerfully strong
[1:41:28] in this place
[1:41:30] it's a lighthouse it's a beacon
[1:41:32] as brother branham would brother green
[1:41:34] would always say it's it's like he an
[1:41:37] icon
[1:41:38] it sits here as a testimony not of what
[1:41:41] jesus was
[1:41:44] but also what he is
[1:41:47] and there's a way to do that
[1:41:50] there's a biblical way to approach
[1:41:53] that
[1:41:54] and he gives it to us in paragraph 87
[1:41:57] he said just wax
[1:41:59] that
[1:42:00] much
[1:42:01] closer
[1:42:03] together
[1:42:08] you've got to get closer together
[1:42:11] in spirit you've got to come closer
[1:42:13] together
[1:42:15] you can't let the enemy divide
[1:42:18] the ranks
[1:42:20] it doesn't matter if there's a hundred
[1:42:22] or three hundred or if there's fifty it
[1:42:24] doesn't matter how many
[1:42:26] what matters is if those who remain
[1:42:31] can pull
[1:42:32] together
[1:42:34] as a unified body
[1:42:37] to shut out the enemy
[1:42:40] to silence his accusation i'm preaching
[1:42:43] to you
[1:42:45] pulling us together
[1:42:47] so that we are not going to be satisfied
[1:42:51] until god performs his glorious work
[1:42:56] among us not just as survivors
[1:43:00] but as overcomers
[1:43:02] oh hallelujah you really believe it's
[1:43:05] possible yes because it says it is
[1:43:09] this word tells us but when we get in a
[1:43:12] place
[1:43:13] like we do some time we just get so
[1:43:16] negative
[1:43:18] and we even start thinking we don't need
[1:43:21] one another
[1:43:25] you need one another
[1:43:27] we need one another can i go on thank
[1:43:30] you
[1:43:31] it's not 12 o'clock
[1:43:34] you just wax that much closer together
[1:43:36] now this this
[1:43:37] paragraph means something to me
[1:43:40] he said take the buckle
[1:43:44] as the brother testified a minister here
[1:43:46] the other night
[1:43:48] about having a buckle
[1:43:50] about seeing it in a vision
[1:43:53] just that buckles on
[1:43:56] the whole armor of god
[1:43:58] let me tell you that's a reality the
[1:44:00] armor of god is a reality
[1:44:02] i want to say that again the armor of
[1:44:05] god is a reality
[1:44:09] it's a reality
[1:44:10] it's not just a figment of the
[1:44:12] imagination
[1:44:14] but we literally by spiritual obedience
[1:44:18] we can take on
[1:44:20] the armor of god
[1:44:23] brother branham said you've got to
[1:44:24] buckle that on tighten up
[1:44:28] move right up close to one another love
[1:44:31] one another anyhow
[1:44:35] aren't you glad he puts it anyhow
[1:44:37] i like that
[1:44:39] because that lets me know
[1:44:41] that he recognizes it's not always easy
[1:44:44] anyhow
[1:44:46] that means in spite of all the other
[1:44:48] everybody's not easy to love
[1:44:51] you're not easy to love
[1:44:54] whoa
[1:44:57] when you're looking in the mirror you're
[1:44:58] looking at someone who's not always easy
[1:45:00] to love
[1:45:02] we're at our best we're okay but at our
[1:45:06] worst we're not very lovable
[1:45:08] but somebody
[1:45:09] loves us anyway
[1:45:12] somebody loves us anyway
[1:45:15] so we pull up and we we look over and we
[1:45:18] love one another anyhow he said here's
[1:45:20] the key he said talk nice about one
[1:45:22] another
[1:45:24] there's some people you have to dig a
[1:45:26] little bit
[1:45:27] but you can always find something nice
[1:45:29] to say about a brother or a sister if
[1:45:31] you believe that say amen
[1:45:34] it reminds me of the
[1:45:36] of an old preacher i probably told this
[1:45:38] here before
[1:45:39] but
[1:45:40] sister west some of you know the west
[1:45:42] family
[1:45:43] they were in brother branham's meetings
[1:45:45] and brother west went home to be with
[1:45:47] the lord last
[1:45:48] year but sister west
[1:45:51] is still alive and her dad was a was an
[1:45:54] assembly of god pastor and he sponsored
[1:45:56] brother branham and macon
[1:45:59] and
[1:46:00] he was of the idea that all babies are
[1:46:02] not purdy
[1:46:06] and before you criticize him i'm in his
[1:46:08] camp
[1:46:11] because i've seen some pretty
[1:46:14] pretty ugly babies
[1:46:16] now the good thing is they usually grow
[1:46:18] out of it
[1:46:22] and i can't help it if all four of ours
[1:46:24] were amazingly beautiful
[1:46:27] i can't be responsible for that
[1:46:29] nor what happened after but when they
[1:46:31] were when they got here
[1:46:33] they were beautiful but i've seen some
[1:46:34] that weren't so pretty when they got
[1:46:36] here they've had a hard time getting
[1:46:37] here
[1:46:38] and their head looks a little crooked
[1:46:39] you know
[1:46:41] and they look like they've been beat up
[1:46:42] or something and you and and you and
[1:46:44] everybody wants the pastor to think
[1:46:46] their baby's beautiful and i really want
[1:46:48] to think that for everybody but
[1:46:49] oh my
[1:46:51] sometimes people will bring their little
[1:46:53] baby and say
[1:46:55] oh here brother shelly you want to hold
[1:46:56] the baby and i'm thinking oh my
[1:47:00] it's a good thing god can love
[1:47:01] everything
[1:47:03] i'm just kidding
[1:47:05] you can laugh it's okay
[1:47:08] this old brother stucky when someone
[1:47:10] would give him a baby
[1:47:12] so that he didn't show himself
[1:47:15] uh his real true feeling
[1:47:18] they would hand him a baby to look at
[1:47:19] he'd say oh my i've never seen another
[1:47:23] one like it
[1:47:26] you see that's not very committed is it
[1:47:29] that could mean i've never seen one so
[1:47:31] beautiful it could mean i've never seen
[1:47:33] one so ugly
[1:47:35] my point is you can always find
[1:47:37] something nice
[1:47:40] to say about one another
[1:47:42] if you dig a little deeper
[1:47:45] in the message the pergament church age
[1:47:48] this is the sermon not the book
[1:47:50] paragraph 17.
[1:47:52] brother random said try to do something
[1:47:54] good
[1:47:56] and just keep being good
[1:47:59] hold no malice
[1:48:00] no grudges
[1:48:02] don't let any bitterness no matter how
[1:48:04] bad the person is
[1:48:06] and how bad they talk about you
[1:48:08] don't never think evil in your heart
[1:48:10] against them because right there the
[1:48:12] devil will sit right in work up
[1:48:14] something right there just keep it all
[1:48:15] covered up with godly love confession
[1:48:18] making right do good to those who do
[1:48:21] evil to you does that sound like christ
[1:48:24] if you only do good to those who who do
[1:48:27] good to you
[1:48:28] why jesus said the publicans do that
[1:48:31] they do the same see the sinners anybody
[1:48:34] can be good to those that are good to
[1:48:35] them but be good to those who are not
[1:48:37] good to you do something for those that
[1:48:40] would do nothing for you
[1:48:42] speak a good word for the man that would
[1:48:43] speak evil against you and that way you
[1:48:46] keep all the bitterness
[1:48:48] out of your heart
[1:48:50] and you're always in love with everybody
[1:48:52] then as long as you stay
[1:48:55] in love
[1:48:58] number three the last
[1:49:00] these were three ways that you can be
[1:49:02] the weapon formed against your life
[1:49:05] number one stay in stink and thinking
[1:49:08] number two holding on to a grudge
[1:49:10] and allowing a root of bitterness to
[1:49:12] spring up in your life number three
[1:49:15] if you choose to walk in unforgiveness
[1:49:18] two and three they go pretty close
[1:49:20] together don't they
[1:49:21] because the only way to let go of a
[1:49:23] grudge is to forgive
[1:49:25] and we're pretty finicky about our
[1:49:26] forgiveness these days
[1:49:28] he never asked me she never asked me i
[1:49:31] want you to know nothing could be more
[1:49:33] unscriptural than that
[1:49:36] there's nowhere in the bible that it
[1:49:39] tells us to only forgive those who ask
[1:49:44] jesus is pretty straight here
[1:49:47] in mark chapter 11
[1:49:49] and verse 25 and 26 if you've got your
[1:49:52] bible you might want to turn there and
[1:49:54] you might want to mark this highlight it
[1:49:56] or circle it or do something you might
[1:49:58] want to keep this in mind because
[1:50:00] forgiving one another is not an option
[1:50:04] verse 25 of mark 11 and when you stand
[1:50:06] pray and
[1:50:08] forgive every time you pray just make
[1:50:12] sure that you're forgiving
[1:50:15] if you have an ought against any
[1:50:18] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:50:20] may forgive you your trespasses let me
[1:50:22] read it again and when you stand praying
[1:50:24] forgive if you have an ought against any
[1:50:28] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:50:30] may forgive you your trespasses whether
[1:50:32] they ask you or not
[1:50:34] when you stand to pray
[1:50:36] forgive anyone that you have an ought
[1:50:40] against
[1:50:42] the next verse but if you do not forgive
[1:50:45] if you do not forgive
[1:50:48] neither will your father which is in
[1:50:51] heaven forgive your trespasses
[1:50:56] who would have ever thought
[1:50:58] that our ability to be forgiven
[1:51:01] is directly connected to our ability
[1:51:04] to forgive
[1:51:06] this is what jesus said
[1:51:08] this is a new age doctrine
[1:51:10] this is red letter edition
[1:51:12] this is jesus speaking to us and how are
[1:51:16] we capable of doing that it's only
[1:51:18] through his grace
[1:51:20] it's only through his grace
[1:51:22] it's only by painting our mind
[1:51:25] with calvary's blood
[1:51:28] it's only by claiming the promise of
[1:51:31] god's
[1:51:32] word forgiving people
[1:51:36] in your life
[1:51:37] even those who are not sorry for their
[1:51:40] actions
[1:51:42] because if you hold on to anger it only
[1:51:44] hurts you
[1:51:46] now this is perfect faith message
[1:51:49] and i'm done
[1:51:51] so close to being finished
[1:51:54] paragraph 19 this settles it for me i
[1:51:56] could read you
[1:51:58] 100 quotes on forgiveness
[1:52:01] but this settles it for me
[1:52:03] he said now faith
[1:52:05] is based
[1:52:07] on forgiveness
[1:52:09] there it is
[1:52:12] and then as we said this morning trying
[1:52:14] to get the church into the place to
[1:52:15] where we could really see apostolic
[1:52:17] times moving among us
[1:52:19] now this was in 63
[1:52:22] august
[1:52:24] seals have been preached
[1:52:27] and brother branham is still talking
[1:52:29] about the desire
[1:52:30] to see apostolic times
[1:52:33] moving
[1:52:35] among us
[1:52:37] wouldn't you like to have
[1:52:39] come on now don't don't don't say yes if
[1:52:41] you
[1:52:42] if you'd rather have an old dead dry
[1:52:45] religion you're entitled to that that
[1:52:47] opinion
[1:52:49] but if you're here and you'd really like
[1:52:51] to see apostolic times moving among us
[1:52:54] again now remember that doesn't just
[1:52:56] come with healing the sick and raising
[1:52:57] the dead
[1:52:58] it also comes with ananias and sapphira
[1:53:03] it's not just power we're looking for
[1:53:05] we're looking for the holy ghost to
[1:53:06] clean the church
[1:53:08] we need all of that if we're going to
[1:53:10] have apostolic times i almost felt you
[1:53:13] with me there for a moment
[1:53:15] and he says very clearly he said uh
[1:53:19] come if if we're trying to get the
[1:53:21] church into the place where we could
[1:53:22] really see apostolic times moving among
[1:53:25] us that's where we all hunger and it's
[1:53:27] just laying right at the door we see it
[1:53:30] but we want to see more of it
[1:53:36] this is august
[1:53:38] he's preached the seals in march
[1:53:42] it hasn't produced enough apostolic
[1:53:45] times
[1:53:46] that he's satisfied
[1:53:49] so he said we we have it
[1:53:52] but we'd like to have more
[1:53:55] whoa
[1:53:57] we want to see more of it
[1:54:00] we want it such a flow that it'll be a
[1:54:02] help to us
[1:54:04] and it will flow out of us
[1:54:07] to others
[1:54:09] isn't that a good word
[1:54:11] to all of us
[1:54:13] now in closing
[1:54:16] if you musicians would just cut back
[1:54:17] here for a moment
[1:54:24] when i was
[1:54:25] reading the quote there from
[1:54:28] concerning uh the the buckle christ is
[1:54:31] the mystery of god revealed paragraph 87
[1:54:35] that's a very special paragraph to me
[1:54:37] i'll just give you this word
[1:54:39] a little background
[1:54:41] because i know the man
[1:54:44] who saw that vision
[1:54:46] of the belt buckle
[1:54:50] his name was brother gerald cleveland
[1:54:54] and he lived in anderson south carolina
[1:54:58] and i know him
[1:55:00] because he's the man
[1:55:02] who gave me the first tapes
[1:55:05] of brother branham
[1:55:07] spoken word is the original seed
[1:55:10] for those of you who remember
[1:55:14] the
[1:55:15] sister rebecca's magazine the only
[1:55:17] believe magazine
[1:55:19] you will probably remember the article
[1:55:22] about the studebaker
[1:55:24] does anybody remember reading there's
[1:55:27] one sister anybody else hold up your
[1:55:29] hand if you remember it
[1:55:30] reading the article sister yarber there
[1:55:33] the article about brother branham
[1:55:35] praying over the studebaker well you
[1:55:36] should go it you can get that online
[1:55:39] it's online
[1:55:41] the the uh magazines are there in pdf i
[1:55:45] guess you call it and you can see
[1:55:48] this experience that brother cleveland
[1:55:50] had with brother branham praying over
[1:55:52] the studebaker it was a miracle
[1:55:55] i i i know that that god can heal
[1:55:58] possums
[1:56:01] and i know that now that god can heal
[1:56:03] studebakers
[1:56:05] so he can surely take care of what's
[1:56:07] wrong with you and i
[1:56:09] and so brother
[1:56:11] brother cleveland was a dear man a dear
[1:56:13] godly man
[1:56:14] he died a few years back
[1:56:16] on our way to tucson we were we were
[1:56:19] coming out here for harmony a few years
[1:56:21] back
[1:56:22] and he slipped away we had just been
[1:56:24] with him a day or two before
[1:56:26] he was about 96 or 97.
[1:56:29] he was a survivor of pearl harbor
[1:56:32] and uh once this and and guadalcanal
[1:56:36] in the philippines he saw some real
[1:56:38] action
[1:56:39] and it changed his life forever he came
[1:56:42] back from
[1:56:44] the foreign field hungry for god
[1:56:48] he had promised god
[1:56:50] that he would serve him if he would
[1:56:51] bring him home
[1:56:53] and he got home and he got busy
[1:56:56] and he he didn't really give his heart
[1:56:58] to god like he promised and
[1:57:00] one night an old timey preacher was
[1:57:03] preaching a tent revival in anderson
[1:57:05] south carolina
[1:57:07] and brother cleveland was standing there
[1:57:09] with some army buddies
[1:57:11] along the fence outside the tent and
[1:57:14] that old church of god preacher
[1:57:16] pointed his finger and said some of you
[1:57:18] soldier boys standing there
[1:57:21] you promised god on the field
[1:57:26] whoo
[1:57:27] i can't help it i'm sorry i can't help
[1:57:29] that
[1:57:30] whoa
[1:57:32] he said you told god
[1:57:34] that if he let you come back and kiss
[1:57:36] your mama again
[1:57:39] you would serve him all the days of your
[1:57:41] life
[1:57:42] and he just came here and told me to
[1:57:44] tell you he's come here to take that
[1:57:46] promise he's come to claim what you
[1:57:48] promised him
[1:57:50] and brother cleveland was gloriously
[1:57:52] saved and baptized
[1:57:54] with the holy spirit the holy ghost and
[1:57:57] fire
[1:57:58] and not too much after that he began to
[1:58:01] hear about a prophet's ministry
[1:58:03] and he was a he was a spiritual man and
[1:58:06] he saw visions and dreams
[1:58:09] which is which is i don't know whether
[1:58:11] to say it or not i think i will it's
[1:58:14] just book of acts
[1:58:19] may there be more
[1:58:21] spiritual dreamers among us
[1:58:24] we know the word is the focus
[1:58:27] this is our preeminent here right here
[1:58:30] but
[1:58:32] we need confirmations
[1:58:35] and we need god some time
[1:58:37] to just come and help us in that way and
[1:58:40] and yes i believe in visions
[1:58:44] and i believe you can have visions and
[1:58:46] and it doesn't necessarily mean you're
[1:58:48] trying to take a prophet's place
[1:58:50] because you see visions and he saw a
[1:58:53] vision
[1:58:54] of a belt buckle and he didn't
[1:58:56] understand it and it was
[1:58:58] it was like brass
[1:59:01] but but something moved over the top of
[1:59:03] it it looked like one buckle laid on
[1:59:05] another
[1:59:06] and when that buckle was lifted that old
[1:59:10] plane
[1:59:11] brass belt buckle had been turned to
[1:59:13] gold
[1:59:16] he said i
[1:59:17] i wanted so bad
[1:59:20] to share that with brother branham
[1:59:23] he said i didn't even intend to tell him
[1:59:25] it was me that had but i wanted him to
[1:59:27] tell me something about it what it meant
[1:59:31] he got there
[1:59:32] for a wednesday night
[1:59:35] service at the tabernacle and meetings
[1:59:37] were going to begin on friday
[1:59:40] and
[1:59:41] they he asked if brother brandon would
[1:59:43] be in the service and they said they
[1:59:45] didn't think brother branham would be in
[1:59:46] the service at night but he got there
[1:59:49] brother cleveland
[1:59:50] and
[1:59:51] they asked for testimonies
[1:59:55] and he said i'm going to share this i i
[2:00:00] i'm going to tell my little experience
[2:00:03] and he stood up and told this little
[2:00:05] experience he said i had only been
[2:00:07] talking just a few minutes when the side
[2:00:09] door opened and brother branham walked
[2:00:11] in out of the study
[2:00:13] and pulled up a folding metal folding
[2:00:15] chair
[2:00:16] and put it down and sat on that metal
[2:00:18] folding chair and he said it was almost
[2:00:21] like brother branham just focused right
[2:00:23] on me he heard everything i had to say
[2:00:26] and when i got through telling that
[2:00:28] vision brother gerald cleveland said
[2:00:30] brother branham got up and walked over
[2:00:32] to the pulpit
[2:00:33] and said now i want to tell this brother
[2:00:35] something
[2:00:37] he said out there in the vestibule
[2:00:40] is a picture
[2:00:42] and it's the picture
[2:00:44] where we we describe it by saying the
[2:00:47] lilies grew
[2:00:49] how many of you know what i'm talking
[2:00:50] about we have more a sequence of
[2:00:52] pictures
[2:00:53] and in one of them it looks like the
[2:00:56] fire was on the altar on the on the
[2:00:58] flowers and what was in front and it
[2:01:01] looked like the lilies just grew in that
[2:01:03] picture well in that picture is a golden
[2:01:06] belt buckle
[2:01:07] and no one knew at that time it was
[2:01:09] there
[2:01:11] and brother branham said brother
[2:01:14] to to brother cleveland he said well
[2:01:16] when we leave here you go out there and
[2:01:18] look at that picture and you'll see that
[2:01:20] golden belt buckle there
[2:01:22] he said that
[2:01:24] is what buckles on
[2:01:26] the whole armor of god
[2:01:28] and he said we got to have that
[2:01:31] and i like to tell that story
[2:01:34] because it helps me to remember
[2:01:38] that i have a responsibility
[2:01:40] to make sure
[2:01:42] that i take on that whole armor of god
[2:01:46] and i equip myself
[2:01:48] with all that god has provided
[2:01:52] because we're too busy helping the enemy
[2:01:54] sometime
[2:01:56] form weapons
[2:01:58] against our own life
[2:02:00] we could almost
[2:02:01] put him out of business if we would
[2:02:04] start dealing with our grudges
[2:02:07] if we would start living in forgiveness
[2:02:11] instead of walking in unforgiveness and
[2:02:14] if we would take authority
[2:02:16] and control
[2:02:18] of our own thoughts
[2:02:20] we could almost shut the enemy down in
[2:02:22] our lives
[2:02:23] give him a whole lot less tools to use
[2:02:26] against us
[2:02:27] this is not going to happen to you
[2:02:29] automatically because you heard a sermon
[2:02:32] about it it's only going to happen when
[2:02:34] you take responsibility for what the
[2:02:36] enemy's trying to do in your own life
[2:02:38] if you'll do that brother sister god
[2:02:41] will give you victory over those
[2:02:42] thoughts
[2:02:44] and he'll give you the grace to replace
[2:02:46] every negative thought with a promise
[2:02:50] from god's word would you stand with me
[2:02:53] thank you for your attention this
[2:02:55] morning
[2:02:56] i'm so thankful
[2:02:58] for what god has given us the tools
[2:03:02] that he has given us to overcome in this
[2:03:04] hour
[2:03:05] and i know there are many other ways
[2:03:08] that you can become a tool
[2:03:10] that the enemy uses against you in your
[2:03:12] own life but i'm going to ask the lord
[2:03:15] to reveal that to you
[2:03:16] i'm going to ask him to make it clear to
[2:03:18] you
[2:03:19] because you've got enough to deal with
[2:03:21] without you being your own worst enemy
[2:03:24] can somebody say man
[2:03:26] greater is he
[2:03:28] greater is he
[2:03:30] that is in me
[2:03:31] than he that is in the world
[2:03:34] i will keep those in perfect peace
[2:03:37] whose mind
[2:03:39] is stayed on me
[2:03:41] great peace have they which love the law
[2:03:43] of god
[2:03:44] and nothing shall by any means
[2:03:47] offend them
[2:03:49] lord we want to forebear one another
[2:03:52] we want to forgive one another
[2:03:55] we want to buckle on that whole armor of
[2:03:57] god
[2:03:59] we want to draw closer and closer
[2:04:01] together
[2:04:03] in this wicked hour
[2:04:06] lord we want to see your glory
[2:04:09] we want to see apostolic days
[2:04:13] increase
[2:04:15] what we see you doing
[2:04:18] in a little scale
[2:04:20] we'd like to see it just sweep through
[2:04:22] this place
[2:04:24] and you just heal the sick
[2:04:27] somebody reach up and take you at your
[2:04:29] word and
[2:04:30] come in with a need and go home with it
[2:04:32] met
[2:04:34] not even a prayer line
[2:04:36] just faith
[2:04:38] reaching up
[2:04:40] to take you at your word
[2:04:43] i want you to just spend a moment with
[2:04:44] me your head bowed before the lord
[2:04:47] i want you to ask him right now and i'll
[2:04:49] agree with you
[2:04:51] that he would reveal to you any way
[2:04:54] that you're cooperating with the enemy
[2:04:56] to become a weapon
[2:04:58] formed against your own life
[2:05:01] and i want you to resign from that job
[2:05:03] today i want you to make up your mind
[2:05:07] that i'm going to help myself not hurt
[2:05:09] myself
[2:05:10] i'm going to encourage myself in the
[2:05:12] word and i'm going to pray in the spirit
[2:05:16] and be built up in the holy ghost
[2:05:19] and instead of fighting myself i'm going
[2:05:21] to let god come and have his way in my
[2:05:23] life
[2:05:25] lord i'm asking you right now across
[2:05:27] this room
[2:05:29] i feel your presence here
[2:05:33] and i know lord that this was the right
[2:05:35] word for this day
[2:05:37] and i'm asking you to quicken it to
[2:05:39] somebody's mind right now and to their
[2:05:42] heart
[2:05:43] i'm asking you to speak to them
[2:05:46] of what ways they might be cooperating
[2:05:48] with the enemy
[2:05:50] against their own life
[2:05:52] i'm asking you lord right now to give
[2:05:54] somebody a a nudge in their faith
[2:05:57] that they might be able to take you at
[2:05:59] your word
[2:06:01] and pull down those
[2:06:03] imaginations and those thoughts and
[2:06:05] those reasonings
[2:06:07] that become also negative
[2:06:10] and possess their mind
[2:06:12] in sanctification before you
[2:06:15] in the name of jesus
[2:06:18] we expose the enemy
[2:06:21] we expose him in this house today
[2:06:24] we say he's a liar and the father of all
[2:06:28] eyes

[2:06:45] even suicidal thoughts
[2:06:48] that came to me about three times
[2:06:52] while i was speaking
[2:06:54] that someone under the sound of my voice
[2:06:57] had been dealing with that of late
[2:07:00] some of you bound by addiction
[2:07:04] and you want jesus to set you free

[2:07:11] and let him come and take full
[2:07:14] possession of who you are you can't hold
[2:07:17] anything back
[2:07:19] nothing is off the table

[2:07:24] before the one of whom we have to do
[2:07:27] and we just let him walk through
[2:07:29] every part of who we are
[2:07:32] with his healing

[2:16:07] you made a comment there for steve
[2:16:10] that this is what the lord had for us
[2:16:12] today
[2:16:14] there was an assurance to you all of a
[2:16:15] sudden
[2:16:17] yesterday
[2:16:19] in the room we'd gotten
[2:16:21] some calls some more information
[2:16:24] these folks were sick
[2:16:25] this was happening
[2:16:28] and my wife just looked at me and she
[2:16:30] said why does it seem
[2:16:33] that we're not being healed
[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:37] and i had just gone through something
[2:16:39] that read
[2:16:40] where brother ram says
[2:16:42] the greatest battle ever fought
[2:16:45] and i said there was a time when the
[2:16:46] battle was a physical battle
[2:16:50] in the dark ages they gave their life
[2:16:52] they went through things that just
[2:16:53] destroyed them a literal giving of their
[2:16:56] life
[2:16:58] but he said in this day it's going to be
[2:16:59] a battle of the mind yes sir
[2:17:02] the greatest bad living he says satan
[2:17:04] chose the mind god chose the heart
[2:17:07] and we were talking about this and i
[2:17:09] said see what the battle is today
[2:17:12] having no idea what brother steve would
[2:17:14] be ministering today
[2:17:17] the battle belongs to the lord
[2:17:19] hallelujah
[2:17:22] let him have preeminence in you
[2:17:26] if there be any virtue if there's any
[2:17:28] praise think on these things
[2:17:30] [Music]
[2:17:32] you have two ways to sing the song
[2:17:34] i can i will i do believe
[2:17:38] or i can't i won't i don't believe
[2:17:41] yes which way do you want to sing it
[2:17:42] today
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:45] choice is yours
[2:17:47] say lord help me today
[2:17:49] to begin to take and apply what the word
[2:17:51] of god says about me
[2:17:53] i am redeemed i am his purchased one he
[2:17:57] gave his all for me
[2:18:00] i don't have to live this way
[2:18:03] but there and i'm as guilty as anybody
[2:18:05] if not anymore
[2:18:07] it's hard to say i'm sorry it's hard to
[2:18:10] say i'm wrong
[2:18:13] oh but the peace and the deliverance
[2:18:15] that comes with it
[2:18:18] when something has been made
[2:18:21] right
[2:18:22] when it can no longer hold you
[2:18:26] its tentacles are destroyed its grip is
[2:18:28] destroyed
[2:18:31] and what used to be a struggle what used
[2:18:33] to be a pull what used to be suddenly is
[2:18:35] not there anymore
[2:18:38] because
[2:18:39] it's you've been delivered of it
[2:18:43] when you stand and pray
[2:18:45] forgive
[2:18:46] so your father will forgive you
[2:18:50] oh the blood the brother is saying about
[2:18:52] the blood the precious blood the shed
[2:18:54] blood it did everything it needed to
[2:18:56] accomplish
[2:18:58] nothing was missed
[2:19:00] you're the one that misses out when you
[2:19:02] want to accept
[2:19:04] what it'll do for you and you know what
[2:19:06] the greatest and i'm speaking to myself
[2:19:08] [Music]
[2:19:10] that i've been forgiven is when i
[2:19:12] forgive
[2:19:12] yes sir
[2:19:14] when i say lord take what i have and
[2:19:16] give it to my brother give it to my
[2:19:18] sister give it to my neighbor such as i
[2:19:21] have i give unto you in the name of the
[2:19:24] lord jesus christ something to share
[2:19:27] i'm going to say one more thing the lord
[2:19:28] reminded us
[2:19:30] when we first began to get back together
[2:19:33] after the passing away of brother green
[2:19:35] and we began to go through all these
[2:19:37] things we had heard the word schedule go
[2:19:40] around saying we had hope tucson
[2:19:42] tabernacle would fail and close
[2:19:47] got phone calls saying we told we were
[2:19:49] told you didn't exist anymore
[2:19:52] and there were people that wanted it
[2:19:53] that way
[2:19:54] not the brothers and sisters that was
[2:19:56] satan's work
[2:19:58] but he's been exposed because brother
[2:20:00] brian prayed over this place saying may
[2:20:02] this little place stay open
[2:20:04] until jesus comes
[2:20:06] and we're here today almost stand on the
[2:20:08] promise of god
[2:20:10] i'm going to stand on the promise of god
[2:20:13] where two or three are gathered in his
[2:20:15] name he'll be in our midst
[2:20:18] every promise of the god every promise
[2:20:20] in the word is mine every chapter every
[2:20:23] verse every line
[2:20:25] now i don't know how brother steve feels
[2:20:28] but it was in my heart
[2:20:30] just seeing how it would go this morning
[2:20:32] if you'll come back tonight
[2:20:34] and maybe the lord would use him in a
[2:20:36] way i know i know what he was doing
[2:20:38] there
[2:20:39] just fill that pull that pull
[2:20:42] and and you catch those things
[2:20:45] brother branham would be there
[2:20:46] ministering and he would say that spirit
[2:20:48] is calling out to that spirit for help
[2:20:51] this one is crying out for help
[2:20:53] they know they're about to be uh made
[2:20:55] open about to be destroyed and they're
[2:20:57] about they're crying out for help but
[2:20:59] the same time brother branham said one
[2:21:01] time he said the holy spirit just fell
[2:21:02] on that man right now
[2:21:05] and then he goes what
[2:21:06] if he couldn't show me the spirits are
[2:21:08] crying out for help you don't think he
[2:21:09] could show me that man just received the
[2:21:11] holy ghost he can do the same thing
[2:21:14] it hasn't changed he's the same
[2:21:16] yesterday today and forever
[2:21:19] he's a living god
[2:21:21] amen
[2:21:22] brother toby i didn't get that request
[2:21:24] for your your hand
[2:21:27] here mom
[2:21:28] all right gail your name
[2:21:30] will remember her in prayer
[2:21:32] i'm sorry i didn't see it on my phone it
[2:21:35] was forwarded to me
[2:21:36] for the toby's mom gail remember her in
[2:21:38] prayer also
[2:21:41] next saturday
[2:21:43] the memorial
[2:21:44] for sister lori tamblins and the family
[2:21:46] up in flagstaff if you're able to go the
[2:21:48] family would appreciate it
[2:21:50] i'm sure
[2:21:52] because we're all part of the family of
[2:21:54] god
[2:21:55] so
[2:21:56] let's just bow our hands for a moment
[2:21:57] lord
[2:22:00] you know yesterday
[2:22:02] [Music]
[2:22:03] as me and mom were talking
[2:22:05] and i had just read that portion
[2:22:09] about the greatest battle ever fought
[2:22:10] god chose the heart satan chose the mind
[2:22:15] and then she asked me that question
[2:22:17] why does it seem that way
[2:22:20] but you had already put something in my
[2:22:22] heart to be able to answer that question
[2:22:25] it's because we're in that age
[2:22:27] the greatest battle i ever thought is
[2:22:28] that thought process
[2:22:31] now brother steve was able to bring both
[2:22:32] sides what the scripture says and even
[2:22:34] what science has proven
[2:22:36] and as hard as science wants to disprove
[2:22:39] god all they do is show the
[2:22:41] infallibility of god that's it that's
[2:22:43] all they prove that's all they show
[2:22:46] because every knee
[2:22:48] and every tongue
[2:22:50] shall bow and confess
[2:22:52] that you are the lord jesus christ
[2:22:54] lord let us do it willingly
[2:22:57] and recognize christ in one another
[2:23:00] the very work of god and love one
[2:23:01] another lord jesus may we come with
[2:23:04] expectation when we come trusting and
[2:23:06] believing
[2:23:08] give our brother steve some rest in his
[2:23:10] body
[2:23:11] lord in his spirit in his mind
[2:23:13] lord as he would come tonight and we
[2:23:16] would draw
[2:23:17] and we would pull on you it's not
[2:23:19] brother steve
[2:23:20] it's a working of the holy spirit lord
[2:23:22] we have to believe that today lord

[2:23:27] christ's name
