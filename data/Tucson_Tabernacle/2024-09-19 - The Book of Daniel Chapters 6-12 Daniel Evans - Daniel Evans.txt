good we have uh Daniel leading songs we have Daniel in the audience here with his newly W bride here we have Daniel Daniel in the pull pit it was Daniel cubed but now it's uh Daniel I don't know what you call four times but uh yeah a lot of Daniel here tonight um before we get started uh if you uh heard my whatap this morning we um everything is looking better looking good we're making progress slowly and um we uh we're excited we have upcoming Camp uh for those of you streaming in make sure that you've signed up for Camp um with uh brother Jeremy sister Angela there make sure that we can get you into a bunk and um if you need a ride brother Paul sister andreana and I can be the default if you need anything you can just call me and I can I can help with everything um Daniel The Book of Daniel has been just it's tremendous people have dedicated their lives theologians have dedicated their lives to studying this book and um it is it's just it's one of the most tremendous Pro books of Prophecy and interesting books that you will ever read in your whole life um so tonight tonight what we will do is if the Lord's willing we will finish up uh The Book of Daniel we'll start in Daniel chapter 6 and then from chapter 6 to chapter 7 it's uh the book changes the first half of the book is prophecy and dreams but it's mainly stories about Daniel and about Babylon and and about the different Kings and then in chapters 7 through 12 it Chang changes to more along the feeling of Jeremiah or Ezekiel or Isaiah where it just becomes a book that's just full of Prophecy one of the things about Daniel that is really amazing more than any other book of Prophecy in the Bible is that a lot of Daniel you can really nail down to this was the Fulfillment of that prophecy and in fact here's the person that fulfilled it like we talked about a believers in Daniel chapter 2 when Nebuchadnezzar had his dream and and he had the head of gold and then the silver and then bronze and all the way down to iron we see that was first it was fulfilled with the head of gold with Nebuchadnezzar and then the next was a less valuable smaller was uh silver was the mes and Persians it even says that that happens that that way and then we see the Greeks come in which which hasn't happened yet in this book with Alexander the Great and and how he conquers the world and then finally these legs of iron hard metal and that was the Roman Empire very very plain and much of Daniel and uh and just deep but I I do have to always throw out a warning there is the Book of Daniel has produced some uh really um overly religious spirits and trying to understand this book trying to pin it down to the exact year the exact time and really if you add up all of the years it's easy to try to do that so just in a warning with Daniel it's it's a wonderfully prophetic book it's a beautiful book but just be careful about going too far with this book and with the prophecies remember just keep your balance in the scriptures follow follow the the the teachings but as I said we have seen some real fanaticisms and I'm sure all of us have in trying to take this Book of Daniel and interpret it and say this is how many years and here's the year that it's going to happen people have done that um for a long time so let's go let's let's turn um to Daniel let's start with the very end of chapter five Daniel chapter 5 verse 30 and it'll give us a little foundation so we know that uh the the Hebrews have already been they've been thrown in the fiery furnace we know that that Nebuchadnezzar was a man a high-tempered king and a very very powerful King very um and his his Reign just just went through the whole world and we know that he uh let the kingdom then went to his son Bazar and they were drinking and partying one night and they disrespected the vessels and disrespected God's ordinances from the temple and that's when the handwriting on the wall came up and uh Bazar his KN his knees knocked together and it was that very night as that handwriting was on the wall that an alliance between the mes and the Persians there was an invading Army that came from them and uh they probably history would say that that they waited through the river and underneath the walls where the water came underneath the walls of Babylon and the Army snuck in under the cover of Darkness underneath the walls through the river and then they they came up and then they conquered this really unconquerable city called Babylon and uh that was the night that Bazar was killed Daniel stayed and uh this man dasas the me took over Daniel chapter 5 verse 30 says this says and in that night Bazar the king of the caldan was slain the king of the caldan slain and daras the median took the kingdom being about three score and two years old so he's 62 years old when this man dasas took over Babylon became the ruler now he was a joint ruler with with Persia and we're going to hear the mention of this man Cyrus later on who was who was the King of Persia at the time um so times passed passes between this Invasion and when they take over and Daniel is he's a great man and wherever he was and whatever he did he succeeded he was he must have been a very honest man a very capable leader and uh he he was just he just did well in everything that he set his heart to do and one thing that we see with Daniel and you see in the in the previous chapters that Daniel even though he lived in Babylon and even though he was successful in Babylon he still didn't partake in the sins of Babylon he didn't eat the King's food he didn't partake in the idolatry we see that in his influence on Shadrach mhach and abedo and we see that Daniel he stood up for what's right but he was still very successful in the world that he lived in and it goes to show you that Daniel actually was elevated and we'll read here shortly he was elevated to a very powerful political de um position and I've heard sometimes that Christians that they should stay out of politics and I think well that sounds good but like Daniel lived in Babylon we live in this world and we need to make a difference in this world as Daniel made a difference in Babylon Babylon prospered the mes and the Persians prospered because of Daniel's strong leadership and his Godly way even though he wasn't he didn't partake in their sins he still lived under their laws and still did a good job and and he still helped the country so with Christians we're part of this country so we should also influence as much as we can this country as Daniel did whether it be with our voting whether it be with our communities or whatever it is we have a role to play in this world it's not in the Bible but we've heard it said that we are in this world but not of this world and it's the same here with Daniel Daniel lived in Babylon he was a Babylonian he was like an American citizen and he helped the country but he amazingly he kept his testimony Daniel chapter 6 verse one remember dasas was the one who invaded took over the country it pleased dasas to set Darius daras however you want to pronounce it it pleased daras to set over the kingdom 120 princes which should be over the whole Kingdom again these are political appointees by the king and over these three presidents of whom Daniel was first that the princes might give account unto them and the King should have no damage then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and the princes because he because an excellent spirit Spirit was in him and the King thought to set him over the whole realm So Daniel is a top ruler now in this Kingdom of Babylon what's replaced Babylon and he is as he as I said he's doing he's living outside of his homeland he was a very young man when he was taken out of of Jerusalem out of Judea and brought there but he's still living a good life he's still prospering he's still honest and and the rulers of the country and this King saw how great of a man this Daniel was so he promoted him to a very very important position one of the very very top positions then the presidents and the princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error found in him people people we see that people wanted to bring Daniel down because he set such a good example because he overcame The Temptations of Babylon did you ever see when you want to start living right and maybe the people that you're around you make changes in your life you get rid of something that you used to do you're trying to come to church more often you're trying you're trying to live better and do you see how sometimes people first thing they say is who do you think you are self-righteous you think you're better than me and you never said you're better than anybody you're just trying to serve the Lord but do you see how people will come against you because you are trying to serve God I'm sure all of us have been there and they say you know who do you think you are and what they do what they want to do is now you're doing better and I can't think of any other reason that they put you down other than pure jealousy because you're doing better and they don't want to do what you're doing they want Babylon they want the world so they will put you down for it and the green monster Wells up within them as happened right here I'll say it again verse number and the presidents and the princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him then said these men we shall not find any occasion against against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God so maybe if you're living a good life you're living a life above reproach maybe they might see something in you it's okay I can't attack brother Jeremy maybe I will attack his religion or his church or what he believes and then that way I can bring him down to my level then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him King dasas live forever all the presidents of the kingdom and the governors and the princes and the counselors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for 30 days save of thee O King he shall be cast into the Den of Lions so right now they're playing on the king's V ity and possibly playing on his insecurities so the King was basically a God and when you were a totalitarian dictator like that like um like we see we've seen in Stalin and in Hitler and and even in like North Korea the the guy there they hate religion because they can't control it and the the main thing with them is they are quick to condemn anything that is outside their sphere of influence so if they're if if they're not in control they're fine with religion as long as they can control the religion but if you get outside of that sphere of influence that is when this dictator or this narcissist or whatever it is it will lash out because you're outside of his control and here there and it's because it's an insecurity and some of these these dictators the the most powerful dictators are some of the most insecure people that you ever that you oversee they're so afraid they're dominated by fear they're dominated that their this fear they're always thinking that someone's gonna come and take their Kingdom away so these people are smart when they come to dasas and they're saying hey King they're worshiping other people maybe they're worshiping other gods you're the God dasas why don't you make a decree so that no one for this 30 days that they're not allowed to look to anyone else except you King you're the great one you're the smart one and they had ulterior motives now now oh King establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the mes and the Persians which alter it not so the key here is when the king signed a decree even he himself according to the law of the mes and Persians could not change it it was a law and even the king himself was subject to that law wherefore King dasas signed the writing and the decree now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house so Daniel who's a who's a ruler here he's he's watching all this and he knows the decree he knows what's going to happen and then the King goes and these guys trick him into signing it so Daniel watches and it says right here when he knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did before there's a time to follow the law of the land as Jesus said said when they asked him if they should pay taxes Jesus said give to Caesar what Caesars follow the law and Daniel he had followed the law he had enforced the law of the land but here is something this raised above the law of the land and this was preventing Daniel from worshiping in the way that pleased God and Daniel said no and Daniel broke the law not only did he break the law he opened up his windows so everyone could see and prayed out there so everyone knew it he wasn't going to be he wasn't going to go into his closet on this one and pray in secret he was going to say listen I don't believe in this this is wrong I am protesting that this decree has gone forth no way I stand for my God so he gets out there in front of everyone and he prays after he knew that the writing was signed and you notice they knew where he was going to be in the building because do you remember when Solomon dedicated the temple way back in our Bible study and you remember what he prayed he said Lord no matter where they are in the world if they will just look towards this Temple which is in Jerusalem and they will pray then you will answer th their prayers and here is Daniel he remembered even though the temple was torn down Daniel still pointed himself towards that Temple according to the word of God and prayed beautiful then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplications before his God it's a bit of an understatement they knew where he was going to be they knew which direction he was going to be pointing they knew what was going to happen because they tricked the king into making this decree just to get Daniel because Daniel was such a good man was so successful they had to bring him down so they knew they were watching I'll read it again then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God then they came near and spake before the king concerning the king's decree hast thou signed a decree King that every man that hath a that shall ask a petition of any God or man within 30 days except for you of course O King shall be cast into the Den of Lions the king answered and said this thing is true according to the law of the mes and Persians which alth not which can't change I signed it I made this decree so these guys set him up and he's about to find out about their deception and I'm sure all of us have been deceived or been set up by someone the old saying is fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and here is the king and he realizes he's been duped I'm trying to trick someone into getting your way is a losing proposition going about something dishonestly like these men did it's the case with Daniel and it's the case today never try to get your way through deception you'll lose then answered then answered they and said before the king that Daniel which is of the children of the Captivity of Judah regardeth not thee O King nor the decree that thou has signed but maketh his position three times a day this guy not only is he disrespecting your law but he's doing it three times a day like he always has now Daniel right here as I said he is breaking the law but he's doing it because that law is preventing him from worshiping and there's a time when we break the law and it's not for our own good it's not for our own benefit it's not to get ahead of someone that time to break the law is when that law comes against God then the King when he heard these words was sore displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him and he labored to the going down of the sun to deliver him so he was probably going to all the judges and all the lawyers and ask of them listen I made this decree look at here it is I signed this but can we get out of this because this Daniel these guys tricked me I didn't know and the judges was like nah King you really you signed it it's it's law you you have to abide by it so all day long this king is going and he's trying to get out of this decree that he made and he can't so he did everything that he could and then these men assembled under the king and said unto the king know oh King that the law of the mes and Persians is that no decree nor stat nor statute which the king established may be changed then the king commanded he felt awful right now and you're going to see this this was probably the worst day of his life and he's thinking about Daniel he's like man oh man then King commanded and they brought Daniel and they cast him into the Den of Lions now the king spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee so the king had done everything that he could Daniel had stood for the Lord and the King he raised it up he's like I can't do anything and when we can't do anything brothers and sisters when we do everything we can like this King did he exhausted to all possibilities and that's like a lot of times I see people and they just sit back and they say oh well I'm just waiting for God to do something in my life that is not scriptural even right here in this King he did everything that he could all the way to the going down of the sun he tried everything that he could do but there was a time when he says I can't do anything more Lord here it is but he tried we are required to do our best to try to get everything in in order and then when we can't do it anymore Lord here it is where we at verse number 16 and he casts them into the den of lions and he says that your God will deliver you and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the King sealed it with his own signant and with the signant of his Lords that purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel then the king went to his Palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of Music brought before him and his sleep went from him he was awake all night worrying about Daniel but let me tell you something else he was still a king and I'll bet doesn't say it here but I'll bet there were some thoughts about what I am going to do to those guys that tricked me when all of this is over then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste into the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel and the King spake and said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living God is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the Lions Imagine The Hope that he had in his heart this is going to be a miracle comes up to the stone says Daniel did God deliver you can you imagine how he felt when he when he heard oh King live forever and ever my God has sent his Angel and hath shut the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innoc innocency was found in me and also before thee oh King have I done no hurt so he says King I'm innocent I didn't do anything wrong I didn't do anything against you King even though he broke the law Daniel stood with a clean heart and he was able to say and brothers and sisters this is so beautiful he was able to say I am innocent in this matter stand before those Lions walk in those Lions Den and see those hungry ravenous lions and him say I'm innocent I didn't do anything wrong then God sent an angel and protected him then the King was exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no matter of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his God you can underline that one in your Bible because Daniel believed in Jehovah and the King commanded and they brought those men which had accused Daniel listen let me stop right here so I have a friend he's a he was a colonel before he retired he was in Iraq and um so he would he would talk to some of the um some of the the Muslims while he was there and he would tell them stories and they knew the Bible very well but they didn't know the Book of Daniel for some reason they they didn't study that that book and he told them all the stories in the Bible and their favorite story that they that they had heard out that of anything that this brother told them was not that Daniel was saved from the Lions but that they fed his accusers to the Lions then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found was upon him because he believed in his God and the King commanded that they brought those men which had accused Daniel and they cast them into the Den of Lions them their children and their wives can you imagine what you would say to your husband you did what and their wives and the Li ions had the Mastery of them and break all of their bones in pieces orever they came out they came at the bottom of the den then King dasas wrote unto all the people Nations and languages that dwell in all the Earth peace be multiplied unto you here's another decree these kings are constantly making decrees they constantly make mistakes Daniel proves them wrong and then they say worship the god of Daniel over and over more and more decrees I make a decree that every Dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of Daniel for he is the Living God and steadfast forever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his Dominion shall be even unto the end he delivereth and rescue with and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in Earth who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the Lions so this Daniel prospered in the reign of d and in the reign of Cyrus Cyrus the Persian now if we remember from our Bible study before that Cyrus is the one that released the Jews with zerubabel and then with uh Nehemiah and with with uh Ezra he's the one that that eventually released them to go and we're going to get to that here uh actually let's get to that right now um so we Chang now now the The Book of Daniel is split basically into two pieces the first six chapters first half of the book are these stories that we've gone through now and then the next six chapters are heavy prophecy and like I said Daniel really above all of them you can really dig into these because it's pretty easy to read and it's fairly easy to understand and it's just amazing so now Daniel we're going to going to go back and Daniel's an old man probably 85 90 years old and he's been in Babylon since I don't know since he was probably 15 years old or so seven years old I forgot how how old he was when he came out but he's been in Babylon like about 68 years and uh Daniel chapter 7 and 8 are prophecy es that I encourage you to read we don't have time to go through them we're just doing an overview here and let's go to chapter n chapter n is like in all the Bible it's huge as far as prophecy I mean it is as deep as they get so let's let's read it remember Daniel's an old man in the first year of dasas the son of hashiras the seed of the mes which was made King over the realm of the calans now remember this is the second Kingdom remember NE Nebuchadnezzar's dream as I said the head of gold was Nebuchadnezzar now we're in the second Kingdom the chest and the arms of silver in the first year of the reign of his Reign I Daniel understood by the books the number of years understood by books the number of years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in desolations in Jerusalem so this is important so here's Daniel and he's reading his Bible he knows that Jeremiah as a prophet reading his Bible he's reading the Scrolls and he's reading these Prophecies of Jeremiah and like all of us it's like I don't understand maybe what's going on when I read many of these these books like Jeremiah and Ezekiel and and Isaiah and here Daniel is and he's got this great understanding and he looks and he sees 70 years A Prophecy from Jeremiah saying this king is coming and we are then and our people are going to be in bondage for 70 years Daniel's like I'm an old man now and it's been about 68 years since I was taken out he grew up he lived most of his life almost all of his life there in Babylon and now he sees whoa we are right there so what did he do and I set my face Daniel Prayed and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments so Daniel knows he sees that hey we're this is this is about to be fulfilled and what does he do he doesn't start jumping up and down saying Yahoo we're about to go home he gets on his knees and he starts praying and he starts confessing his sins and the sins of his people and I pray prayed unto the Lord my God and I made my confession and said Lord Oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments Daniel hadn't done that but he's confessing that his that his people had done that neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our Kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land so here's Daniel and he's confessing all these things he's he he he's he's crying out to God for Mercy because he knows something big is about to happen and let's skip down to verse number 19 for time sake Daniel continues his prayer and he says oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh Lord hearken and do not defer and defer not for thy own sake oh my God for the city for thy City and thy people are called by thy name and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people is the people the sin of My People Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God yay whilst I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in a vision at the beginning we have gone through that when he when he sees when he seen Gabriel earlier being caused to fly swiftly that was a couple chapters earlier I actually skipped over it being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation so he sees this Angel the evening oblation is the evening sacrifice the temple was shut down there was no more sacrifices going on in the temple there was there was no more of all this but still Daniel had remembered and was still honoring that and he says it's about the time of this evening oblation that he informed me and and talked with me and said oh Daniel I have now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplications the Commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision listen to this 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in Everlasting righteous righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy I ask the church to listen to these sermons The Daniel Series this is the very Foundation of Gabriel's instructions to Daniel the first in the series right here sixfold purpose of Gabriel's instructions to Daniel and this is a timetable for these six things to be accomplished now if you listen to that sermon that I I recommended you will see that Hebrew is written and one week can me mean seven days or one week can [Music] mean seven years so here this prophecy very plainly one week equals seven years and if you listen to the sermon you know that even as the congregation repeat one week equals seven years so 7times 7 one week equals 7 years equals 490 years I'm not going to even attempt to break it down but it's it's pretty simple this has nothing to do with the 70 years of Jeremiah this is a different prophecy this has not occurred yet as when Daniel is speaking so we have this 490 years that are going to happen and if you look most believe that 40 that um 69 of those weeks were accomplished and if again if you listen to the sermons 69 of those weeks were accomplished until the coming of Christ and it's very specific almost to the day when Jesus most most Scholars most theologians think when Jesus wrote in to Jerusalem as a triumphant King that completed the 49 weeks or the um I'm sorry the uh 69 weeks but then there were and I'm gonna okay I'm going to give you some message Doctrine here this is going to be messes brother brandom said in in the 70 weeks of Daniel if you've listened if you listen to him he said that there were seven years left to be accomplished and those seven years would happen after so what happened was this this 69 weeks had been accomplished to Jesus it left a portion of time there was is What's called the Gentile dispensation you've heard that before God is dispensing the message of Jesus Christ to these gentile people who have never been part of anything before and now it's their turn so he blinds the eyes of his children his the Jews and then he gives the gospel to the Gentiles and that's not numbered but we have about 2,000 years since that has happened and then we have still we have a time period left brother brandom said in um in one of these one of these three sermons he said that there are seven years left but then he came back in questions and answers later on and he said no three and a half years there's only a half a week left three and a half years were fulfilled in Jesus's Ministry and there's three and a half years left okay I don't care one way or the other you know why I don't care because when that that time starts ticking the Gentile bride is gone the tribulation start I'm not going to be here I don't care if it's seven years or three and a half years doesn't matter one bit to me so some one of those ridiculous arguments that message theologians have got in over the years that mean absolutely zero mean nothing where where are we verse number 25 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in Troublesome times and after three score and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off but not for himself that word cut off the Messiah shall be killed but look how beautiful but not for himself how awesome is Jesus Christ he'll be cut off but has no self-serving motive of at all it was for someone else it was for the guy standing in the Pulpit right now and all of you all too and the people of the prince shall come that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined so the Messiah shall be cut off he was crucified he was killed but not for himself and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of Abominations he shall make desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate so thus we have the close of Daniel 9 as I said one of really the most incredible chapters of Prophecy in the entire Bible you can read it over and over and over as I said you can get out your calculator and you can you can add everything up and and really I I will say this there there is a time of this Gentile dispensation but I think whatever you come up with that we can see that the time we are living in is close to the end we really are and if you look at this Book of Daniel I don't believe I really don't believe that God would have put it in here if he didn't want us to understand it I don't think he wants to confuse us he put it in here so we can study it so we can work these things out and like I said whatever you come up with you'll never know the day you'll never know the you'll never know when he's coming in fact when somebody says lo here is the Christ then you say h no Jesus warned us not to listen to you but you can look and you can see that this time is late and let's go to Daniel let's skip on down to Daniel chapter 12 for time sake and before we read Daniel 12 Let's uh let's turn to Revelation chapter 6 you guys know what Revelation 6 is the seven the six seals seven seven seal is Revelation chapter 8 Revelation chapter 6 is these famous and controversial Seven Seals Revelation 6 verse1 just kind of load this in the data banks and I saw when the lamb had opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and when he when and he went forth conquering and to conquer and when he had heard when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given unto him that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and behold and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and he and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard and the voice of the forth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with a sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar alter The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with the loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true do thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and the white robes were given un unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren as should be killed that as they were should be fulfilled and I beheld and when he had opened the stick seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth and the moon became as blood and the stars of the heaven fell under the Earth even as a fig tree cast her untimely figs and when she when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and great men and rich men and cheap captains and mighty men and every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said un the mountains and the Rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the day for the great day of his wrath is come who shall be able to stand Daniel chapter 12 says this and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book this is just before the end and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt this I believe is the first mention of everlasting life in the Bible and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the fent and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever look at that for a minute and they that be wise shall sign as the bright ESS of the Firmin and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever so he's he's saying here that those that really shine are those that are introducing others to the light of the Gospel really they're the ones that are leading other souls to the Lord says right here in the Book of Daniel that that they are the ones that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal up the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased think about that prophecy for a minute many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased this month let me uh this month I have gone to Hawaii Oakland Los Angeles Las Vegas Phoenix Flagstaff and Ikea that's like a city just me just in the past month that's where I've gone how was that possible before how has that been possible in all of history until this modern day that I can fly from Tucson to Oakland to Hawaii back to Oakland to Las Vegas to Tucson and then next week I'm I'm flying to um Atlanta and then I'm going to Nashville and then I'm I'm flying Atlanta again back to Tucson and then I'm driving up to Pinetop and then back down all over the place and literally this is in two months time a month and a half of time going to and fro all over the place that was never possible in the history of the world I mean how long did it take from Paul or for Paul to get to I don't know from Antioch to uh to um Tarsus you know or or to Jerusalem long time it took him to to to cross the Mediterranean and and and all of that but here I did all that I don't know what is it 5,000 miles away 4,000 miles away to uh maybe 4,000 3,000 miles away to Hawaii I did it in like a few hours six hours to and fro everywhere and not knowledge shall increase I look this up today and the copper age so so working of metal the copper age started about um 5,000 years ago so they started being able to make metal about 5,000 years ago then another Thousand Years passed pass before they were able to make another metal that was just a little bit harder called bronze another thousand years it took him to get that and then wait another 1,500 years for iron this hard metal to use so we're looking for 2500 years to go from shaping copper to shaping iron that's 500 years longer than it is from here to Jesus back that's a long time really long time but listen to this the first telephone was installed in a house in 1879 you remember it was installed the White House the first telephone installed 1879 it wasn't until more than a hundred years later in the 1990s that became Main stream and everybody had a phone in their house for like over a hundred years and then in the 1990s that cell phones became mainstream about 20 years later 2007 the iPhone came along 2007 most people here were well into their life in 2007 that wasn't that long ago that the iPhone came along then the next year about a year and a half later the iPhone 2 came out and that made it to where you can start surfing the internet and and and going all over efficiently like the iPhone 3G you remember that was that was the thing man even my son remembers that you know you were like you were an old kid when when the iPhones were there you're 5 years old when uh when the iPhone came out so my son Zeke you kids are are older than the smartphones and it seems like we've had them forever so it took 2500 years to go from copper to iron it took a hundred years to go from a house phone to a cell phone took 20 years to go from a cell phone to a smartphone and it took 15 years for this Smartphone to get to the point where it is now where it is part of our everyday life and we almost can't get by without this phone all of this happened in this short amount of time and I can ask brother Lyle I asked Siri today where you live and she told me yeah gave me your address knowledge shall increase whatever you want to know is right here and look at how fast it's happening it was thousands of years just to get a little bit better technology to make a just a little bit harder medal and now look at how fast things are going knowledge shall increased in the last days it's here there's there's no doubt we are there Den I Daniel looked and and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the one on that side of the bank of the river he's in a vision and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the ri the Waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders and I heard a man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river and he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever it shall be for a for a time times and a half time and when he shall and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy of the Holy people all these things shall be finished very similar to Revelation chap 10 believe it's verse 6 you know what let's read it got it right here in my Bible I think it's Revelation 106 yeah right here Revelation 105 says this and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon upon the Earth lifted up his hand to Heaven does it sound familiar to what I just read and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created a heaven and the things that are therein there are and and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer exactly right here almost verbatim from The Book of Daniel and I heard but I understood not then said I oh my Lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand it but the wise shall understand that's why we can pray like Daniel did Lord give me understanding of this book Lord give me understanding of these prophecies they were important to Daniel and they're important to us because now we're there we' have arrived as I said to and fro seems very plain that that's today no pun intended when I said plain but it's very clear that that that is today knowledge shall increase how can it get more than the little rectangular Idol that I keep in my pocket tells me everything I need to know and a lot more verse number 11 and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the Abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be 1,290 days blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the, 3530 days but go thou thy way till the end for Thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days thus we have the end I believe of the Book of Daniel and the musicians can come it's uh we don't have time to really dig in verse by verse and brothers and sisters nor do I really want to I um as I said many people have have D dug into it and then set a date or set a time or set a Doctrine I really I want the church to understand that if you add up all of these numbers it's late and it comes out to be around our time the time of the Gentile dispensation is closing Israel as prophesied it was 2,000 years from the time that they were in Jerusalem and we had Herod there and and they were dispersed they they went out 2,000 years that that God has taken this gospel this Bible of Jesus Christ and given it to these heathens called Gentiles for 2,000 years we go through the ages in Revelation chap 2 and chapter 3 and then that time is scheduled to come to a close and when it closes the Jews as prophesied and brother Lyall and I have gone over it over and over again they're prophesy to come back to their Homeland to have their own country to have their own people to have their own Army to have God with them that has happened they're there these prophecies are coming to pass now if they haven't already many of them and we are right there you wonder why it's it is so important I go back to that that beautiful scripture let me see if I can find it it verse number three and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever they that turn many to righteousness Jesus Christ is that righteousness that's our job turn people the him and they'll they'll shine forever Daniel I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me into all my days I've been held in your hands from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head oh I will sing of the goodness of [Music] God cuz all my life you have been faithful and all my life
