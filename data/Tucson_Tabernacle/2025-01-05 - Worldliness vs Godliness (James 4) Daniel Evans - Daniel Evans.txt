[14:39] said he had never been so
[14:42] sick with uh whatever it was it is has
[14:45] come
[14:46] by but we have a promise a fulfilled
[14:52] Promise by his stripes we were healed
[14:56] you know sometimes we can look at it and
[14:58] say Lord I but if you can just take him
[15:00] at his word and says lord it's a promise
[15:02] it's already been fulfilled and
[15:04] therefore I'm going to begin to say I am
[15:06] healed I I'm well I'm okay you know well

[34:07] to have you all um it's been uh brother
[34:10] Aaron mentioned that it's uh this has
[34:13] been a rough week uh I was as sick as
[34:16] I've ever been um and uh I I went Sunday
[34:21] afternoon after church I went and I took
[34:25] the time to go and visit some of the
[34:29] people that are in the hospital and pray
[34:30] for them a lot of people had the flu a
[34:33] lot of people were admitted with
[34:35] dehydration or or whatever it might be
[34:38] and uh I I never want to be unthankful
[34:41] but I received something
[34:44] too I got the flu yeah and uh and I'll
[34:49] tell you what when you get it you can
[34:51] really you can really enter into
[34:54] somebody else's suffering when they have
[34:55] it so don't
[34:58] I mean when we get sick it's it's not
[35:01] always a it's a bad thing but it's it
[35:04] can always be for the the glory of God
[35:07] so we want to give him glory in in all
[35:09] things I um I was talking with sister
[35:13] Amelia's son yesterday brother Adam he's
[35:17] incarcerated in
[35:18] Florence and he they get a phone call
[35:22] every once in a while and he he called
[35:23] me
[35:24] yesterday and he uh
[35:27] he was giving me
[35:29] testimony about how that he got kicked
[35:32] out of a group that he was worshiping
[35:36] with and he's he made him feel kind of
[35:39] bad I said my brother Adam I said what
[35:42] would you do to get kicked out and you
[35:45] know it's it's always I'm always looking
[35:48] at trying to look at both sides and and
[35:50] he really did and he said brother Daniel
[35:52] he says I didn't do anything he said
[35:54] they looked into they did some checking
[35:57] on me and how I believed and and they
[36:00] said that they just didn't want to have
[36:02] someone that believed like me
[36:04] fellowshipping with
[36:06] them and uh I said I said you sure and
[36:10] he said he said yeah he said I uh I was
[36:15] praying and he said the Lord told
[36:18] me three
[36:21] things and I'm
[36:23] always I always tell people use caution
[36:26] when you say the Lord told me me because
[36:28] what you are saying is thus sayeth the
[36:29] Lord that God said this this I I really
[36:33] believe the Lord did tell brother Adam
[36:35] this and he gave him these three
[36:39] instructions he said don't
[36:42] argue don't
[36:44] complain and don't defend
[36:47] yourself with these
[36:49] groups and Adam went into
[36:52] that um went into those groups and with
[36:56] that attitude and tell you that is the
[36:59] right way to be we don't have to always
[37:03] defend ourselves we don't have to always
[37:05] argue our positions what we can do is we
[37:07] can find common ground in this book
[37:11] which is Jesus Christ and if we can't
[37:13] find that Common Ground then there is
[37:15] something seriously wrong it doesn't
[37:18] have to be I'm not saying it's wrong
[37:20] with us but it it is wrong if we cannot
[37:23] meet together on the foundation of Jesus
[37:26] Christ
[37:28] so I I thought that was I thought I
[37:30] would I'd like to tell the church that
[37:32] um that the Lord did show him that don't
[37:34] argue don't complain and don't defend
[37:37] yourself because then sometimes it it
[37:39] turns into these NeverEnding arguments
[37:42] and it just doesn't do any good for the
[37:45] visitors we've uh been going through the
[37:47] Book of James and uh we we started uh
[37:52] about a month ago I guess uh James
[37:54] chapter 1 and today we are going to get
[37:58] to James chapter 4 little background on
[38:00] James James was the pastor of the church
[38:05] in Jerusalem the First Christian Church
[38:08] and really what looks like the first
[38:10] Christian pastor of course aside from
[38:13] the Lord Jesus and he was his letter was
[38:18] sent out to really these what we would
[38:22] call I guess a Messianic Jew or it's a
[38:24] Jew that they were they were born in Jew
[38:27] they're living as a Jew and then they
[38:29] accepted Jesus Christ and they became
[38:32] the first Christians those are the first
[38:34] Christians they were Jewish people and
[38:36] then they brought the message to the
[38:39] Gentiles and then the
[38:42] Gentiles BR have really spread it
[38:44] throughout the world since that time so
[38:47] James was the pastor of the church at
[38:51] Jerusalem he was also the uh we could
[38:54] call it half brother we could call it
[38:56] Foster brother but he was the brother of
[38:59] the Lord Jesus so they grew up together
[39:02] under the same parents um of course we
[39:06] know that the Lord Jesus was was not
[39:09] made from flesh and blood as as this man
[39:13] James was but they shared the same
[39:16] family and they shared the same um Mom
[39:19] and Dad growing up James chapter 4 we've
[39:22] got through the first three chapters of
[39:24] James now let's go to James chapter 4
[39:28] and get right into the word this morning
[39:31] and 4 chapter 4 verse1 you know what
[39:34] I'll read uh the first few verses I'll
[39:37] read the first four verses and then
[39:39] we'll go back and uh expound upon them
[39:42] James chapter 4 verse one says this from
[39:45] whence come Wars and fightings among you
[39:49] come they not hence even of your lusts
[39:52] that war in your numbers or your members
[39:56] you lust you have not you kill and you
[39:59] desire to have you cannot obtain you
[40:02] fight and War yet you have not because
[40:05] you ask not you ask not or you ask and
[40:08] you receive not because you ask aiss
[40:11] that ye may consume it upon your lusts
[40:15] your adulterers and
[40:17] adulteresses know ye not that friendship
[40:20] of the world is enmity with God
[40:23] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[40:26] the world is the enemy of
[40:29] god wow that is a very profound and
[40:34] Powerful statement from this man Pastor
[40:40] James we start with that first verse
[40:43] from whence come Wars and fightings
[40:46] among you come they not hence even of
[40:49] your lusts that war in your
[40:53] members NIV version says what causes
[40:56] fights in quarrels among you don't they
[40:59] come from your desires that battle
[41:03] within
[41:04] you we have in our
[41:07] lives as a
[41:09] Christian we have a war going on all the
[41:13] time and that war is between two things
[41:16] it's between our flesh which is the
[41:20] world it's between our flesh and it's
[41:23] between the spirit of God that also
[41:26] dwells within us
[41:28] so is this there's this constant
[41:30] fighting going on and it's it's a battle
[41:33] that doesn't end until we pass from this
[41:36] world and it's a it's a battle that's
[41:38] been here really from the beginning of
[41:40] time and it continues on until now and
[41:44] it's going to be here until that time is
[41:46] no more Paul said in
[41:50] Romans chapter 7 and I'm going to I'm
[41:54] going to read a paraph paraphrase
[41:56] version of this this um because it's
[41:59] it's much easier to understand Paul said
[42:03] in Romans 7:8 he says and I know that
[42:07] nothing good lives in me that is in my
[42:10] sinful
[42:12] nature I want to do what is right but I
[42:16] can't I want to do what is good but I
[42:20] don't I I don't want to do what is wrong
[42:24] but I do it
[42:25] anyway but if I do what I don't want to
[42:29] do I'm not really the one doing wrong it
[42:33] is sin living in me that does
[42:37] it I have discovered this principle of
[42:40] life that when I want to do what is
[42:43] right I inevitably do what is wrong how
[42:46] many can relate to
[42:47] that I want to do what is wrong I
[42:50] inevitably do what is wrong I love God's
[42:53] law with all my heart but there is
[42:55] another Power with in me that is at war
[42:59] with my
[43:00] mind this power makes me a slave to the
[43:04] sin that is still Within
[43:07] Me Oh What a miserable person I
[43:11] am who will free free me from this life
[43:16] that is dominated by sin and death thank
[43:19] God the answer is in Jesus Christ Our
[43:22] Lord so you see how it is in my mind I
[43:26] really want want to obey God's law but
[43:29] because of my sinful nature I am a slave
[43:34] to
[43:37] sin that was
[43:39] Romans that was a New Living
[43:41] Translation um of Romans chapter 7
[43:45] verses
[43:46] 18-2 excuse
[43:49] me there is there's this battle and it's
[43:52] going on between it's going on in in us
[43:54] all the time it's there's a desire that
[43:57] wants to be wants to do good but then
[44:00] there's this flesh that also wants to do
[44:04] evil and it's it's within everyone
[44:05] there's no one that doesn't that doesn't
[44:07] have this and whichever is more powerful
[44:12] is the the direction that you're going
[44:14] to go verse two of James 4 says this you
[44:19] lust and you have not you kill and you
[44:23] desire to have and cannot obtain you
[44:25] fight and War
[44:27] yet ye have not because you ask not I
[44:31] don't things James is saying that these
[44:32] Christian people that they are actually
[44:35] murdering someone he's saying that they
[44:39] hate someone remember Jesus said that if
[44:42] you hate a man without a CA without a
[44:44] cause you are murdering that person and
[44:46] here James is saying that you that you
[44:49] lust and you have not you that word lust
[44:51] you
[44:52] desire and you don't have it you kill
[44:55] and you and desire to have and you
[44:57] cannot obain you fight and War and and
[45:00] you have not because you ask not English
[45:03] Standard Version of that says you desire
[45:06] and do not have so you
[45:08] murder you covet and cannot obtain so
[45:12] you fight and quarrel you you do not
[45:15] have because you do not ask remember the
[45:18] the two Natures that I was talking about
[45:20] we desire things that are not the Lord's
[45:24] will and we Des desire to have those
[45:28] things and it's because we don't receive
[45:32] what we pray for because it's a it's a
[45:34] worldly desire that's coming out in us
[45:38] and we say we we get down and we pray
[45:40] and and ask the Lord Lord please please
[45:43] give me this and I need this I need even
[45:47] even this past week I was laying on my
[45:49] back and I was like Lord I'm just this
[45:51] is awful will you Lord will you just
[45:54] heal me so I can get a back about your
[45:58] business but the Lord saw fit to say no
[46:01] stay
[46:02] there because this is my
[46:05] will I I was my my carnal nature is like
[46:10] why don't you just heal me why don't you
[46:12] just heal me because I got a lot of work
[46:13] to do I got to study I gotta I I got to
[46:17] visit people I got to talk to people on
[46:19] the phone I got to get together Harmony
[46:21] in the desert we got to get all that
[46:23] squared away Lord I'm sick and I can't
[46:25] do anything why don't you just heal me
[46:27] me and he
[46:28] didn't he did
[46:32] slowly and
[46:34] methodically but he did it his
[46:37] way and it wasn't my way I wanted it
[46:40] this because I needed I thought that I
[46:42] needed to get to work and I forget that
[46:44] God's in charge God's Sovereign he is
[46:47] the one that understands and he's the
[46:49] one that knows what we need and he
[46:51] wanted me in bed for those days even
[46:54] though I tried to get up and I tried to
[46:56] get out and
[46:57] this is my
[47:00] will and that is what we should desire
[47:03] is his
[47:06] will his the the worldly the fleshly
[47:09] desires that are within
[47:11] us they cause us to seek worldly things
[47:18] according to our own mind when we really
[47:21] should be saying Lord here's what I
[47:25] want but but I would really rather have
[47:28] your perfect
[47:30] will and that's what the Apostle here or
[47:33] the the pastor here is saying he's
[47:35] saying that that listen seek God's will
[47:40] first you ask and receive not because
[47:44] you ask a miss that that ye may consume
[47:47] it upon your
[47:49] lusts NIV says when you ask you do not
[47:54] receive because you ask with the wrong
[47:56] motive motives that you may spend what
[47:58] you get on your pleasures how many times
[48:02] have I talked with people and uh they
[48:05] say oh you know I'd love to I'd love to
[48:07] win the lottery and then I would give
[48:10] 10% to the
[48:12] church keep 90% for
[48:15] myself take a take a100 million dolls
[48:17] and oh you it'd be great I could spend
[48:19] 10 million on the church in fact I'll
[48:21] just give half to the church and I I'll
[48:23] just take the other half for myself and
[48:26] that's the those aren't those aren't the
[48:27] right desires the right desire is to say
[48:30] Lord I want to work I want to do your
[48:34] will I want to be in your will all the
[48:37] time and and whatever you give me I'm
[48:41] going to give you the glory for and the
[48:44] word says that it is by the hard work it
[48:47] is by the sweat of your brow that you're
[48:49] going to make a living and not by not by
[48:53] winning a prize or doing doing something
[48:55] like that
[48:57] it's remember that God he's not
[49:01] obligated to our
[49:03] requests he is
[49:05] God and we are not God he answers our
[49:10] requests that are requested according to
[49:12] his perfect will and not according to
[49:16] our will it's when when we desire
[49:19] something outside of his will we get our
[49:22] fleshly desires and that's when that's
[49:24] when we get in the way of God but we
[49:26] just just Lord put it into your hands
[49:29] here's what the best that I know how
[49:32] here is here is what I think that your
[49:34] will would be Lord if it would be your
[49:36] will then Grant this but if not Lord I'm
[49:39] still going to glorify
[49:42] you wrote this down that prayer is the
[49:47] door for God to accomplish what he wants
[49:51] to do either in me or through
[49:55] me and and that's what prayer is prayer
[49:58] is not to serve ourselves but prayer is
[50:03] to allow that door of God to open up
[50:07] that he might be able to either do
[50:10] something in me a change in me or do
[50:13] something through me to bless other
[50:16] people imagine can you imagine what it
[50:19] would be like to really get the mind of
[50:23] God to really understand the will of God
[50:26] we say it halfhazard Lord thy will be
[50:29] done but can you imagine if we really
[50:31] did get God's
[50:33] will you imagine how great this is the
[50:36] creator of the universe that we're
[50:38] talking about this is the one that gave
[50:41] us life that that gave us eternal life
[50:43] can you imagine actually getting in his
[50:48] mind and actually getting in his
[50:51] will and and being right there to where
[50:55] that you know that that you are in the
[50:57] perfect will of God can you imagine how
[50:59] great that would be to really know that
[51:03] you are in God's will you would be
[51:06] willing to suffer you would be willing
[51:08] to to give everything you would be
[51:10] willing to do anything if you could just
[51:13] find that perfect will of
[51:16] God and then he goes
[51:19] on and he says you adulterers and
[51:22] adulteresses know ye
[51:24] not that the friendship ship of the
[51:27] world is enmity with God whosoever
[51:31] therefore will be a friend of the world
[51:34] is the enemy of God what does that
[51:37] mean what does that mean to be the
[51:39] friend of a world I of the world I know
[51:41] that probably all of us have read that
[51:43] scripture and all of us have probably
[51:46] sat and contemplated what does that mean
[51:49] to be a friend of the world is
[51:54] hatred with God is
[51:57] division with God so what does that mean
[52:00] to if you're a friend of the world does
[52:03] that mean that I'm not supposed to have
[52:04] worldly friends and then how do we
[52:07] Define
[52:08] worldly does that mean that I'm not
[52:10] supposed to that I'm just supposed to
[52:11] hold up in in a in a in a just a group
[52:15] of what I would call Believers and then
[52:17] we could have just just us there and we
[52:20] just keep all the world out is that is
[52:22] that what that
[52:24] means or does it mean mean or does it
[52:27] mean that that I am just to to go to
[52:30] work and not fellowship with anybody and
[52:33] then come home and just keep completely
[52:35] separate what ises what does that mean
[52:36] you can't we cannot completely separate
[52:39] ourselves from the world people try
[52:42] to but I don't believe that that is
[52:45] God's perfect will we have to go to work
[52:47] we have to go to school and most
[52:49] importantly we also have to be a witness
[52:52] of Jesus Christ to other people so if we
[52:55] are trying to hold ourselves up in in a
[52:58] little group or a or a
[53:02] cult
[53:04] and just to separate ourselves
[53:06] completely from the world then you will
[53:10] see and many have seen the sin will rise
[53:15] up right in the middle of that
[53:17] cult it'll rise up right in the middle
[53:20] of those people who thought that they
[53:22] were separating themselves from the
[53:24] world and sin will come out of those
[53:27] people and then it becomes worse than if
[53:29] we wouldn't have separated ourselves in
[53:31] that
[53:32] way it was never the case that we were
[53:37] supposed to form a little sect and to
[53:41] completely separate ourselves that was
[53:43] the opposite of
[53:45] Christianity Christianity came and he
[53:48] said go tell the world about me he said
[53:52] go out and and and tell them that Jesus
[53:56] Christ Christ is risen from the dead so
[53:59] how how can we separate ourselves from
[54:02] the
[54:04] world and then yet live within this
[54:08] world and still be a
[54:11] witness Jesus said as I said he said go
[54:13] ye into all the world and preach this
[54:16] gospel so there's there's the question
[54:19] with
[54:21] James and he's he's he's saying here
[54:23] he's saying don't be a friend of the
[54:26] world because that is hatred with
[54:29] God so what's the answer how how do we
[54:33] do that I had a friend still have a
[54:36] friend he's a
[54:39] um when we were younger he uh believe I
[54:43] was married and um he started dating
[54:48] this young
[54:50] lady
[54:52] and she just wasn't you could tell you
[54:56] know
[54:56] and me being his friend I was like man
[54:59] you sure you want to date this girl and
[55:03] she was one of the she was the girl that
[55:06] looked theart she looked like what the
[55:10] world would call beautiful she acted she
[55:13] held herself in a way that the world
[55:16] would call attractive but you could see
[55:19] it in this young lady that this was not
[55:23] bro this is not where you want to go
[55:26] and yet he said no yeah no I like her
[55:30] and you know we were made for each other
[55:31] and and they ended up getting
[55:35] married and it was trouble from day one
[55:40] and it was because my
[55:43] friend he
[55:45] wanted this type of girl because that
[55:50] represented his desire and his desire
[55:53] was for the
[55:54] world and here is the separation if his
[55:57] desire would have been to please God if
[55:59] his desire would have been to have a
[56:01] have a nice Godly family then he would
[56:04] have moved in a different direction but
[56:05] no he went in the direction of this
[56:07] young lady they got married she ended up
[56:10] getting her degree she left um during
[56:15] covid she left to go on a uh she was a
[56:20] nurse she left to go to New York on a
[56:24] um a traveling assignment you know when
[56:27] they were making big money back then she
[56:31] left and making lots of money there and
[56:34] and she left her her husband and her and
[56:36] her children back home with the plans to
[56:39] come back home she liked that worldly
[56:43] influence she liked living that worldly
[56:48] that worldly life she liked going out
[56:51] with the friends after work and and
[56:55] going to the bars and drinking and and
[56:57] having fun and laughing and and doing
[56:59] those things that's what she desired she
[57:02] liked that money scene she liked that
[57:05] that social scene it was something that
[57:07] she that was inside of her she had that
[57:10] love of the world she was a friend of
[57:12] the world that's what she
[57:14] wanted and then he is back home and of
[57:17] course it
[57:19] led to Affairs and it led to a
[57:22] divorce and now look at the whole
[57:25] situation the whole situation is that
[57:28] that she went exactly where we all knew
[57:31] that she was going to go she went that
[57:34] direction and now he's has a broken life
[57:37] a broken marriage and all kinds of of
[57:40] problems but because he was the first
[57:42] one he wanted that that was his picture
[57:45] of what he wanted was the world and then
[57:48] she her picture was what she wanted in
[57:51] the world it was a friend of the world
[57:55] that that's what they want to identify
[57:57] with with the things of the world but
[57:59] then there's
[58:01] others that they don't want that they
[58:04] may make the
[58:07] mistake but they they they don't have
[58:10] that desire of a my nephew um Joshua
[58:14] Carroll David's or uh Stephanie's
[58:17] Brother David his son I was talking to
[58:20] him the other day and he's going to the
[58:23] U OFA and I'm a graduate of the U OFA
[58:25] I'm not
[58:26] saying that he shouldn't go to the
[58:29] university but he's he's going there and
[58:33] is like Uncle Dan I just I can't stand
[58:37] it he said pushing all the transgender
[58:40] stuff and and he said all of the the
[58:42] promiscuity and everything that is is
[58:44] surrounding me he says I just can't
[58:47] stand it he says and he's a smart kid he
[58:50] he wants to go to school so he's
[58:52] quitting the university and he's going
[58:54] to go to a Christian school now so proud
[58:57] of the young man he says I just don't
[59:00] want to be part of that he doesn't want
[59:03] to be a friend of the
[59:06] world he wants to separate himself he's
[59:08] a good young man he's he's living a good
[59:11] life and he's he's he's he's
[59:13] trying and he just can't stand
[59:17] it and that's how we should be brothers
[59:20] and sisters we should of course have a
[59:23] burden for the world but when it comes
[59:25] to being a friend of the world when it
[59:27] becomes to identifying with the
[59:31] world we can't do
[59:33] it we've got to be able to separate
[59:36] ourselves I remember when I was about
[59:41] that age and it was on my 21st
[59:43] birthday I was you know I wasn't living
[59:46] for the Lord my friends took me out to
[59:49] the bar and and I was sitting there and
[59:54] and uh all of these women around and the
[59:57] and the and the the men and and doing
[59:59] what they do and at the club and and I
[1:00:03] was sitting there and and there was a
[1:00:05] the beer somebody had bought me was
[1:00:07] sitting on
[1:00:08] the on the
[1:00:11] counter and I looked at it and I felt
[1:00:16] odd thing I felt the sweet presence of
[1:00:20] the Holy Spirit come
[1:00:23] down and I looked at that thing
[1:00:27] and I said Lord even
[1:00:29] here even in this awful
[1:00:33] place you came in to this club with
[1:00:38] me and here I am not serving you not
[1:00:43] doing right and there is that drink
[1:00:45] sitting on the on the table and I I said
[1:00:48] Lord UI would even come in here with
[1:00:51] me your holy
[1:00:54] presence and
[1:00:56] I said 'lord I I don't want this this
[1:01:00] isn't something I want to identify with
[1:01:03] this isn't something that that that I
[1:01:05] want to be part of I don't want to be
[1:01:07] friends with the
[1:01:08] world so I went home that night and that
[1:01:11] is the the day in my life that I gave my
[1:01:15] heart to the Lord Jesus on my 21st
[1:01:17] birthday that night when I got home Lord
[1:01:20] I don't want to I don't want any part of
[1:01:21] it I don't want to be friends with the
[1:01:23] world and I separated myself and this
[1:01:25] then you know what the lord gave me
[1:01:27] better friends he gave me he he put two
[1:01:30] of my old friends that I grew up with a
[1:01:33] Baptist friend named Jeff Brown and a
[1:01:35] and a Mormon friend named Sean lanquist
[1:01:38] brought them back into my life and we
[1:01:39] had more fun being Christians than any
[1:01:43] of those guys out there drinking and
[1:01:44] making themselves sick and spending all
[1:01:46] their money we had we had a we had a lot
[1:01:49] of fun we were
[1:01:51] always hunting and fishing and playing
[1:01:54] and laughing and going to
[1:01:56] um going to the U OFA games we were part
[1:01:59] of the University we had a good time and
[1:02:02] we lived
[1:02:04] right and it was because I didn't want
[1:02:07] to be friends with the world I needed to
[1:02:10] make make a separation
[1:02:12] there I was just I so
[1:02:15] proud of Joshua my my nephew he just
[1:02:20] doesn't want
[1:02:22] it it's it's not in him he wants to
[1:02:27] serve
[1:02:29] god let's keep
[1:02:32] going remember the godliness you want to
[1:02:36] be we're trying to separate godliness
[1:02:40] and worldliness here
[1:02:43] godliness will sacrifice
[1:02:47] self and worldliness will promote
[1:02:53] self Romans 12: vers one says this I
[1:02:58] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[1:03:00] mercies of God that you present your
[1:03:02] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:03:05] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:03:07] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:03:10] to this
[1:03:11] world but be ye transformed by the
[1:03:14] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:03:17] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:03:21] perfect will of
[1:03:23] God for I say through the the grace
[1:03:26] given unto me to every man that is among
[1:03:28] you not to think of himself more highly
[1:03:30] than he ought to think but to think
[1:03:32] soberly according as God ha dealt to
[1:03:36] every man The Measure of Faith he's
[1:03:40] saying make your life a living sacrifice
[1:03:42] don't conform to this
[1:03:44] world there's this thing remember I said
[1:03:47] there's pulling back and forth all the
[1:03:49] time and which way am I going to go and
[1:03:51] when I was a young man when I was my
[1:03:53] son's age it was I was pulled this way
[1:03:55] and pulled this way and finally I was
[1:03:57] like no I'm not going that way I'm
[1:03:59] finished with
[1:04:01] it I want God in my life I want the Lord
[1:04:06] Jesus to come out of me I don't want to
[1:04:08] be part of this world but it doesn't
[1:04:10] mean that I didn't have to continue to
[1:04:13] go to school I didn't have to continue
[1:04:14] to go to work I still did but my life
[1:04:17] changed
[1:04:19] then 1 Corinthians we're taking
[1:04:22] communion tonight 1 cor Corinthians
[1:04:24] chapter 11 says this
[1:04:26] verse 28 it says but a let a man examine
[1:04:30] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:04:33] and drink of that cup cup for he that
[1:04:36] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[1:04:39] and drinketh Damnation to himself not
[1:04:41] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:04:44] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:04:46] and many
[1:04:47] sleep so it's not just affecting when we
[1:04:51] go that worldly route when we want to
[1:04:55] conform to the world we're not just
[1:04:57] affecting ourselves but we're affecting
[1:04:59] others and there are
[1:05:01] many that could be healed or there are
[1:05:04] many that that could come out of
[1:05:07] depression or whatever it might be that
[1:05:10] don't because of the influences of the
[1:05:13] world for he that D eateth and drinketh
[1:05:17] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:05:18] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:05:20] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:05:22] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:05:24] we judge would judge ourselves we should
[1:05:27] not be
[1:05:28] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:05:31] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:05:33] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:05:38] brethren when you come together eat to
[1:05:40] to eat Terry one for another he's
[1:05:42] talking about the communion back to
[1:05:44] verse 32 that we should not be condemned
[1:05:47] with the
[1:05:49] world if you're a friend of the world or
[1:05:52] part of the world then of course you
[1:05:54] will be condemned with the
[1:05:57] world when that condemnation comes and
[1:06:00] it's coming it's promised to come so if
[1:06:03] you want to live that
[1:06:07] life then you will be condemned with the
[1:06:11] world because you you have made the the
[1:06:13] conscious choice to be part of the world
[1:06:17] when that condemnation comes you will be
[1:06:19] condemned but we should examine
[1:06:22] ourselves as the Apostle Paul is saying
[1:06:24] examine yourself
[1:06:26] and say Lord am I in your will and it
[1:06:29] doesn't have to be I'm not just talking
[1:06:31] about going to the
[1:06:33] clubs it could be
[1:06:35] Church it could be whatever it is am I
[1:06:38] doing this just to be the popular one am
[1:06:41] I doing this just because this is the
[1:06:42] way that my church thinks am I doing
[1:06:45] this just because this is the way that
[1:06:48] that they do at
[1:06:50] work no I don't want to be part of that
[1:06:54] I want to stand alone with Jesus Christ
[1:06:57] him and me together him speaking to me
[1:07:01] and saying move forward in this way and
[1:07:05] then I will bless you let's go back to
[1:07:08] James chapter 4 verse 5 it says
[1:07:13] this do you think that the scripture
[1:07:16] saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth
[1:07:19] in US lust to Envy English Standard
[1:07:21] Version says or do you
[1:07:23] suppose it is to no purpose that the
[1:07:27] scripture says he yearns jealous
[1:07:30] jealously over the spirit that he has
[1:07:33] made to dwell in US NIV says he
[1:07:36] jealously
[1:07:38] Longs for the
[1:07:40] spirit he has caused to dwell in
[1:07:44] us he jealously long jealous jealously
[1:07:50] Longs for that spirit that he has put in
[1:07:54] US but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[1:07:58] saith God resists the proud but giveth
[1:08:02] grace to the humble look at the context
[1:08:05] he's not telling us to
[1:08:07] join he's not telling us not to join
[1:08:10] with the world not to have worldly
[1:08:12] Ambitions but he's saying to make your
[1:08:15] Ambitions of things that are
[1:08:18] above he's not he's telling us not to
[1:08:21] he's saying he's saying don't have the
[1:08:22] Ambitions that the world has but have
[1:08:24] the Ambitions of things of Colossians
[1:08:26] 3:2 set your says set your Ambitions set
[1:08:29] your minds on things that are above and
[1:08:31] not things that are on the earth
[1:08:34] remember God loves a humble heart
[1:08:37] brothers and sisters he loves a repen of
[1:08:40] Heart And he as much as he loves that
[1:08:45] humble heart he also hates a proud heart
[1:08:48] he hates
[1:08:52] pride and being humble really is the way
[1:08:55] way to submit yourselves to God submit
[1:08:58] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[1:09:01] devil and he will flee from
[1:09:05] you other translations say humble
[1:09:07] yourself before God resist the devil and
[1:09:10] he will flee from you we always quote
[1:09:12] the second part to resist the devil and
[1:09:15] he will flee from you but the first part
[1:09:19] says humble
[1:09:21] yourself before God there's that part go
[1:09:25] goes along with the second part too
[1:09:27] we're always fighting the devil and and
[1:09:28] getting away get trying to get away from
[1:09:31] him but we also have to Humble ourselves
[1:09:33] and get rid of that proud arrogant
[1:09:35] spirit that and with with a that proud
[1:09:38] and arrogant Spirit we will never be
[1:09:40] able to resist the
[1:09:42] devil the first part of it humble
[1:09:44] yourself before God and then resist the
[1:09:47] devil the devil is full of
[1:09:51] Pride and then God hates Pride first we
[1:09:56] go to the Lord with humility and we say
[1:09:58] Lord I am nothing and I know nothing I
[1:10:01] humble myself before you in the name of
[1:10:03] Jesus
[1:10:04] Christ and
[1:10:06] then name your sins to the Lord
[1:10:10] specifically say Lord here's what I've
[1:10:13] done here here's the mistakes that I've
[1:10:15] made will you forgive me and so many of
[1:10:18] us fall into that
[1:10:21] trap of saying Lord forgive me of all my
[1:10:24] sins
[1:10:26] that doesn't really that's not really
[1:10:29] that doesn't get it have you had
[1:10:30] somebody ever had someone come to you
[1:10:32] maybe before communion and
[1:10:35] say um forgive me for everything I've
[1:10:38] done to you
[1:10:41] wrong that doesn't mean
[1:10:43] anything you know what I'm saying that
[1:10:46] person that knows what they're mean what
[1:10:48] they mean but it doesn't really mean
[1:10:51] anything when someone says if I've ever
[1:10:53] offended you please forgive me that
[1:10:55] doesn't that doesn't mean it what you
[1:10:58] need to do is you go to that person and
[1:11:01] say I lied about
[1:11:03] you I did this wrong to you and I'm
[1:11:07] sorry will you forgive
[1:11:09] me then it means something and it's the
[1:11:13] same when we're going before God we say
[1:11:15] Lord I did this
[1:11:17] wrong and I'm sorry please forgive
[1:11:22] me and you'll have you'll other people
[1:11:26] you'll you'll see that they'll they'll
[1:11:28] say you know I've done I've done a lot
[1:11:30] wrong and I want the church to forgive
[1:11:31] me that's not that doesn't count it's
[1:11:35] it's not it's not something that that
[1:11:38] means it's it's just meaningless words
[1:11:41] but when we come to when we come to each
[1:11:43] other and we say that that we've we've
[1:11:46] hurt or or or done something
[1:11:49] specifically then that that's has some
[1:11:52] meaning behind it and I'm not talking
[1:11:55] talking about like you know if you go
[1:11:57] and you say you know I don't like
[1:11:58] brother Daniel's beard because it makes
[1:12:00] him look old and
[1:12:02] fat don't come to me and tell me you
[1:12:05] said
[1:12:06] that because that's not going to do any
[1:12:08] good it's just going to make me feel bad
[1:12:11] but but you can go to the person and say
[1:12:14] you know I really shouldn't have said
[1:12:15] that I mean it does but I'm should I
[1:12:17] really shouldn't have said that and and
[1:12:20] and then that's you have to have some
[1:12:23] wisdom before you're coming back to
[1:12:26] everyone and you're saying Oh I said
[1:12:27] this about you and that about
[1:12:29] you if it did the person harm then yes
[1:12:33] go to the person and and con and confess
[1:12:37] them but otherwise go to the person that
[1:12:39] you
[1:12:40] told and say you know I shouldn't have
[1:12:42] said that about brother Daniel it was
[1:12:44] disrespectful albe it it may have been
[1:12:46] true but it was it wasn't respectful and
[1:12:49] that's not the way that we talk about
[1:12:50] each
[1:12:52] other verse number eight draw nigh to
[1:12:57] God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse
[1:13:00] your hands you Sinners and purify your
[1:13:02] hearts you double-minded be afflicted
[1:13:04] and mourn and weep and let your let your
[1:13:07] laughter be turned to mourning and your
[1:13:09] joy to heaveness that it sounds it
[1:13:13] sounds like a rough thing to say be
[1:13:16] afflicted and mourn and weep let your
[1:13:19] laughter be turned to mourning and your
[1:13:21] joy to heaviness he's saying mourn over
[1:13:24] your
[1:13:26] sins when you were once making fun of
[1:13:29] Walking with
[1:13:31] God turn around and mourn over what you
[1:13:35] did God values that repentance I'll tell
[1:13:39] you what I love when I see especially I
[1:13:44] see it so often in the youth when they
[1:13:47] just there's this Sweetness in their
[1:13:50] hearts when they're really feeling
[1:13:52] repentance I remember when I was there I
[1:13:54] remember
[1:13:56] when I was going to the university there
[1:13:59] was a there was a building that would
[1:14:02] stay open I had a night class and I had
[1:14:04] a few hours in between um my classes and
[1:14:10] I would go into this it was i' go to
[1:14:13] this
[1:14:14] bathroom and I would pray during that
[1:14:18] time and I wouldn't change that time for
[1:14:23] I would I wouldn't trade it for anything
[1:14:25] anything there was a time that I I was
[1:14:27] in there and I was just this young man
[1:14:28] and I was I was repenting of of of doing
[1:14:32] wrong and Lord I Want to Be Right and
[1:14:34] and I was asking him Lord I want one day
[1:14:36] to get married and and would you give me
[1:14:38] a wife and I want a good job and and and
[1:14:41] I want to just do better I want to serve
[1:14:43] you more and I can just imagine how much
[1:14:45] God appreciated that young man going
[1:14:48] into that bathroom and praying all of
[1:14:51] those prayers and I I wish I could go
[1:14:54] back to
[1:14:56] me in my age now and say son the Lord
[1:15:02] appreciate your
[1:15:04] efforts the Lord he sees all that you're
[1:15:08] trying to do instead of trying to give
[1:15:10] all the correction and all the all the
[1:15:12] rebuke and and those things are
[1:15:14] warranted and those things are needed
[1:15:16] but sometimes it's just like I see that
[1:15:19] you're
[1:15:21] trying that means more than anything
[1:15:24] that you could ever do
[1:15:25] and I think the Lord appreciates he
[1:15:28] appreciates it he appreciates when we
[1:15:29] when we go before him and we ask we ask
[1:15:32] him Lord help
[1:15:33] me I read that again draw an ey to God
[1:15:36] and He will draw an nigh to
[1:15:38] you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and
[1:15:40] purify your hearts ye double-minded be
[1:15:43] afflicted and mourn and weep and let
[1:15:45] your laughter be turned to mourning and
[1:15:47] your joy to heaviness humble yourselves
[1:15:49] in the sight of the Lord and He Shall
[1:15:51] lift you up speak not evil one of
[1:15:55] another Brethren he that speaketh evil
[1:15:57] of his brother and judges his brother
[1:15:59] speaketh evil of the law and judges the
[1:16:01] law but if the law but if thou judge the
[1:16:05] law Thou Art not a doer of the law but a
[1:16:08] judge there is one lawgiver who is able
[1:16:11] to save and to destroy who art thou that
[1:16:13] judges
[1:16:15] another go to now ye let's say today or

[1:16:36] vanisheth
[1:16:37] away I love when I'm out fishing and I
[1:16:42] love that morning fog that that lays
[1:16:44] across the
[1:16:46] water and but soon it just goes away and
[1:16:50] it's it's it's gone when the sun comes
[1:16:52] up and that's how our lives are that's
[1:16:55] what James is saying he's saying that
[1:16:57] that your life really it's here and it's
[1:17:02] gone and we make plans when we're young
[1:17:06] or even when we're older that well we're
[1:17:08] going to I'm going to get this new job
[1:17:10] and and I'm going to this is what I'm
[1:17:12] going to do and I'm going to be
[1:17:13] successful and this is how I'm going to
[1:17:15] have this type of family and we're going
[1:17:17] to have a big house and we're going to
[1:17:18] live in this city and all of these plans
[1:17:20] that we make what we should be saying is
[1:17:24] if the Lord Wills I want to do this I
[1:17:28] want to be in God's will first and then
[1:17:32] if I can get in God's will then all of
[1:17:34] the the joy and the blessings are going
[1:17:36] to be there but instead of looking
[1:17:38] towards the worldly things and being a a
[1:17:40] friend of the world as he said earlier
[1:17:43] no Lord I want your will I want to do
[1:17:45] what your will is and then Lord you will
[1:17:48] bless me but the most important thing is
[1:17:51] you father
[1:17:55] and that's how we should live our
[1:17:59] lives to we want to serve God we want to
[1:18:02] please God but you ought to say if the
[1:18:06] Lord will we shall live and do this or
[1:18:09] that but now you rejoice in your
[1:18:12] boastings all such rejoicing is evil
[1:18:17] therefore to him that knoweth to do go
[1:18:19] good and doeth it not to him it is sin
[1:18:24] and that's how he
[1:18:26] closes this
[1:18:28] chapter
[1:18:30] and we think about how our lives and how
[1:18:37] these decisions are made in our lives
[1:18:38] and this is what the Book of James is
[1:18:40] it's just helping us to make right
[1:18:42] decisions in our lives that are going to
[1:18:45] to lead us through life I
[1:18:48] remember when uh when James says here at
[1:18:51] the end he says that
[1:18:55] um to therefore to him that knoweth to
[1:18:59] do good and doeth not to him it is sin
[1:19:01] James is talking about two types of sins
[1:19:04] earlier we have he's talking about sins
[1:19:06] that we have committed in our lives
[1:19:09] things that we have
[1:19:11] done and then James now he says now
[1:19:14] that's not the only sin there are also
[1:19:16] sins because you have omitted
[1:19:21] things you have committed sins and then
[1:19:24] you have sin because you have omitted
[1:19:26] doing things in your life I remember
[1:19:29] when I
[1:19:30] was um soon after I was married I I was
[1:19:34] on a trip to Portland it was Portland
[1:19:38] Oregon and uh I had meetings during the
[1:19:40] day and then the evening I was off and I
[1:19:43] uh I was walking to the Rose Garden
[1:19:46] there um to get food and I saw this
[1:19:51] man walking towards me
[1:19:55] and I knew exactly what was going on
[1:19:58] this was this was in the 90s and uh or
[1:20:01] no this was yeah no this was early
[1:20:04] 2000
[1:20:07] um and I knew exactly what was wrong
[1:20:10] with this man he was obviously homeless
[1:20:14] and he was walking in obviously in a lot
[1:20:16] of
[1:20:17] pain
[1:20:19] and he walked by me as as he was I was
[1:20:23] walking this way he was walking this way
[1:20:25] and I took a breath and I held my breath
[1:20:30] and I walked by the man and he says he
[1:20:34] says um can I talk to you for a minute
[1:20:36] and I just shook my head and I kept
[1:20:39] walking and then he said behind me he
[1:20:43] says I'm dying of AIDS he says can you
[1:20:46] help
[1:20:46] me and I just shook my head and I kept
[1:20:50] walking and I
[1:20:52] knew to do something right there but I
[1:20:56] omitted it and it was sin for me not to
[1:20:59] do it I should have stopped I should
[1:21:02] have at least I I could have given him
[1:21:04] some money but I should have prayed for
[1:21:05] the young
[1:21:07] man but I didn't I just kept walking I
[1:21:10] regret that to this day I I walked I
[1:21:12] don't know maybe F maybe two minutes and
[1:21:14] then I said Lord I'm sorry and I turned
[1:21:16] around and I went back to try to find
[1:21:18] him and I couldn't find man
[1:21:19] anymore and I regretted that to this
[1:21:22] very day I regret not doing doing
[1:21:24] something that was a sin of omission I
[1:21:28] knew to do it and I didn't do it but
[1:21:32] then there are other times when you do
[1:21:34] it and I think it could have been that
[1:21:36] same trip and I'll tell this this is a
[1:21:39] pretty amazing story is I was on
[1:21:42] Southwest
[1:21:43] Airlines and Southwest is I think that
[1:21:47] they're starting to assign seats now but
[1:21:49] Southwest has three and three um on on
[1:21:52] each side of the aisle and you're not
[1:21:55] you're assigned a a uh Zone that you can
[1:21:59] you can enter so you you can be in group
[1:22:01] one a group that you can go in group one
[1:22:02] group two whatever it is
[1:22:05] so I was on a completely packed
[1:22:09] flight and I think I was going to San to
[1:22:13] um not San Francisco I think I was going
[1:22:15] to um somewhere around there and
[1:22:20] I I had the best seat on the whole plane
[1:22:23] and there was not one seat open open
[1:22:25] there was three seats on this side and
[1:22:28] three seats on this side I was on the
[1:22:29] very front row aisle seat I could put my
[1:22:34] feet up and it was just it was like this
[1:22:37] is this is great and I had on the side
[1:22:39] of me I had two little people it was
[1:22:42] this elderly man and this woman so this
[1:22:44] great for they were there and then on
[1:22:46] this side there was um a man and his
[1:22:51] wife and their their young son who is
[1:22:54] probably I don't know five or six years
[1:22:56] old and then they had a baby and the
[1:22:58] baby was I think like two and I'm I'm
[1:23:03] sitting there and and the whole plane is
[1:23:05] packed and I'm like yes this is good I
[1:23:08] got my book I'm going to read it and
[1:23:12] um
[1:23:14] the flight attendant starts arguing with
[1:23:17] a man sitting next to me across the
[1:23:19] aisle and she says um you can't you
[1:23:23] can't all four sit in these seats one of
[1:23:26] you is going to have to go back um to an
[1:23:29] open seat in the back of the plane and
[1:23:32] the um the guy was like no no no you
[1:23:36] can't we just hold the baby and he says
[1:23:37] no the flighton says no you have to have
[1:23:39] an open seat for that child and I was
[1:23:41] like oh man this is not going to end
[1:23:43] good for
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:46] me this argument has nothing to do with
[1:23:49] these people this is all about me and
[1:23:53] I'm sitting there
[1:23:55] and he's he's arguing back and
[1:23:57] forth and finally he says okay fine I'll
[1:24:00] go and I was like no man I said I'll go
[1:24:03] back let me let me go back and you sit
[1:24:06] with your family and I's like oh wow
[1:24:08] thank you so much so I didn't
[1:24:12] sin I I followed the leading of the Lord
[1:24:16] so then I go back I get my backpack and
[1:24:18] I'm like man it stinks so I'm I'm going
[1:24:21] going back and she's like oh thank you
[1:24:23] so much um the seats uh um
[1:24:27] 23b I was like oh
[1:24:31] no number one B I know where B is and
[1:24:34] number two it's at the very back so I
[1:24:36] get my backpack and I'm going through
[1:24:38] and and I look and oh there's
[1:24:41] 23 B and there's this big
[1:24:46] sweaty white man I mean heavy set and
[1:24:51] I'm like oh no and he's next to the
[1:24:53] window
[1:24:55] and then there's this um big broad
[1:24:58] shouldered um black man that uh was
[1:25:02] sitting in the other seat and he's big
[1:25:04] too and and uh he he struck me because
[1:25:09] he had a like he he he had a special
[1:25:12] Aura to him his hair was done in a
[1:25:14] certain way and he he was just a he's a
[1:25:17] nicel looking guy and and the big guy
[1:25:21] and there's the big guy here and big guy
[1:25:23] there and there's this little seat in
[1:25:24] between them and I'm a not a small guy
[1:25:27] so I was like hey I got to sit there
[1:25:29] sorry so so I sit down and uh I'm open
[1:25:33] up my book which is Prince the House of
[1:25:35] David and I start reading reading that
[1:25:38] and I don't know has anybody ever read
[1:25:40] that book tremendous wonderful book and
[1:25:44] I'm reading this and then the black guy
[1:25:47] he looks over my
[1:25:48] shoulder and he looks at the book I'm
[1:25:51] reading and
[1:25:54] he says uh he says 'what are you reading
[1:25:57] and I said oh it's a it's a story about
[1:25:59] the life of Jesus and and he uh he says
[1:26:04] tells me he says he says I'm
[1:26:07] searching and I said really he says yeah
[1:26:09] he says um he says I'm searching he says
[1:26:12] I've gone from church to church and he
[1:26:14] says every church that I go to he says
[1:26:16] it's it's it's just lifting up the
[1:26:18] pastor or it's just trying to get their
[1:26:20] hands in my pocket he says it's never
[1:26:22] about the real thing and he says this
[1:26:24] and he made this this statement that's
[1:26:28] gives me chills today he says I want
[1:26:30] something that's true from Genesis to
[1:26:33] Revelation I was like Wow amen and and
[1:26:37] he said
[1:26:39] Revelation which to me he said okay he's
[1:26:42] he's a bit educated most people would
[1:26:45] say
[1:26:46] Revelations and I so I reached in my
[1:26:49] backpack and I gave him the book um
[1:26:52] William brandom a man sent from God and
[1:26:54] I said here I said this is really if you
[1:26:56] like to read this is something that has
[1:26:58] been a blessing to me and we talked for
[1:27:00] a little
[1:27:01] while and then when he when we left when
[1:27:07] we started going out I thought man this
[1:27:08] is i' really like to talk to this guy
[1:27:11] again I want to get his number or
[1:27:12] something so we when we left um I looked
[1:27:18] for him in the airport I couldn't find
[1:27:19] him so then it's like oh well wow that
[1:27:23] was amazing and that guy just the words
[1:27:25] that he
[1:27:26] said and I thought after that was that
[1:27:30] even real did that even really happen
[1:27:34] was that man a real
[1:27:36] man and I thought from that time I
[1:27:39] thought you know what I think I talked
[1:27:41] to an angel on that
[1:27:43] plane and it was it was because it was
[1:27:46] just the most amazing conversation he
[1:27:47] was the most amazing man
[1:27:50] so
[1:27:52] then speaking of following The Obedience
[1:27:55] of God that was something that was on my
[1:27:57] mind always for 20 over 20
[1:28:01] years I was um about I don't know five
[1:28:05] six years ago I
[1:28:07] was laying in bed and I was watching um
[1:28:10] this these Street Preachers on YouTube
[1:28:13] and not not the ones that just Heckle
[1:28:15] and tell everybody they're going to hell
[1:28:17] but but the ones that were actually
[1:28:18] doing something and I and I saw this
[1:28:21] guy and he was
[1:28:24] preaching to these really rough
[1:28:29] people in uh in um
[1:28:33] Vancouver Washington in the rough area
[1:28:37] the drug area Vancouver and what had
[1:28:39] happened is as he was preaching on the
[1:28:41] street he got a
[1:28:43] following of um a a bunch of um
[1:28:48] homosexual people that were heckling
[1:28:51] him and he he just kept on preaching and
[1:28:55] and he and the this the group of people
[1:28:58] get to the coast and then many of these
[1:29:01] that he had been preaching to wanted to
[1:29:03] be
[1:29:04] baptized and here is this man and it
[1:29:06] struck me as one of the most powerful
[1:29:08] moments and I'll show the video sometime
[1:29:11] one of the most powerful moments that
[1:29:13] this man was there in the water and
[1:29:16] they're spraying Silly String at him and
[1:29:18] and these these crossdressing people are
[1:29:21] splashing water on him and here is this
[1:29:24] man and he has these people that he's
[1:29:27] baptizing and he's he's getting hit in
[1:29:29] the face with a silly string and in the
[1:29:31] water and he baptizes him I notice he
[1:29:34] baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:29:35] and puts him up and the and the people
[1:29:37] were just so excited to be delivered and
[1:29:40] as I was watching this I thought man
[1:29:42] that guy looks
[1:29:46] familiar and I thought it couldn't be
[1:29:49] his hair was done the same way and this
[1:29:52] is 20 years earlier
[1:29:54] the time on the
[1:29:56] plane and I I watched him I said man it
[1:30:00] looks like
[1:30:02] him and I got his phone number I got his
[1:30:05] his email address I got I was able to
[1:30:07] track down the contact
[1:30:09] information and he said he responded and
[1:30:13] he says yeah I vaguely remember that he
[1:30:17] says I remember being on the plane and
[1:30:19] he says I was traveling forth back and
[1:30:21] forth he says I was in seminary at that
[1:30:23] time time and it's not that what I said
[1:30:26] had any in influence on him but it was
[1:30:28] just the obedience that I had to leave
[1:30:30] my seat and to go back then I was able
[1:30:34] to meet this young man who was about my
[1:30:37] age and who was really searching for the
[1:30:39] Lord two young men there are searching
[1:30:41] for the Lord who would take different
[1:30:43] paths in life and then come back around
[1:30:46] and be reunited again through email it
[1:30:48] was just an amazing time and it was
[1:30:50] because I was obedient to the Lord Lord
[1:30:55] and not because that I was
[1:30:58] disobedient as I had been earlier with
[1:31:02] that homeless man and I I regret that I
[1:31:05] wish I could have it back but I learned
[1:31:07] a lesson never to do it Daniel you can
[1:31:08] come in in
[1:31:11] closing so brother and sisters with
[1:31:13] brothers and sisters with
[1:31:16] James and with being a friend of the
[1:31:20] world James is trying to tell us that
[1:31:24] make set your affections on things above
[1:31:27] to to look to the Lord Jesus and to
[1:31:29] serve him and to let that dictate every
[1:31:33] way that you do things and and how that
[1:31:36] you want to live your life not being a
[1:31:41] friend of the world but being a servant
[1:31:45] of God and that is James that's through
[1:31:50] James chapter 4 and uh I thank God that
[1:31:55] I got through it because I was
[1:31:57] uh I feel like the sickness hit me again
[1:32:00] up here in the Pulpit but the Lord the
[1:32:02] lord gave us gave me strength to get
[1:32:04] through
[1:32:11] Daniel I sought the
[1:32:15] Lord and he answered
[1:32:20] me and delivered me
[1:32:25] from every
[1:32:28] fear and those look on
[1:32:33] him are
[1:32:37] radi there'll never be
[1:32:41] ashamed they'll never be
[1:32:46] ashamed this poor man

[1:33:03] enies the Son of

[1:36:33] you the enemy fought me so hard being
[1:36:37] being up here in this this morning I've
[1:36:39] never I've never been fought like that
[1:36:42] and I know it was it was the sickness
[1:36:44] that was trying to manifest itself again
[1:36:48] but we claim I I I preached last week on
[1:36:51] every step that you take in this world
[1:36:55] is your possession as Joshua crossed
[1:36:58] over Jordan every possess every place
[1:37:01] that they took it was their possession
[1:37:03] but they had to fight for every inch of
[1:37:05] it and that's how we are we fight for
[1:37:08] every inch that we get and sometimes
[1:37:11] it's it's uncomfortable to to serve the
[1:37:13] Lord sometimes it's hard to do what
[1:37:14] we're doing but continue to do
[1:37:17] it if if you have if you're placed in a
[1:37:21] position that the the world is around
[1:37:24] you and it's hard to get through
[1:37:27] brothers and sisters remember you are
[1:37:28] not part of this world you are part of
[1:37:32] God and you are not friends with the
[1:37:34] world you are like Abraham you are a
[1:37:37] friend of God and you can separate
[1:37:39] yourself you don't have to be um you
[1:37:42] don't have to form a little cult or form
[1:37:44] a little
[1:37:46] group but you can walk through this
[1:37:50] world led by the Holy Spirit and you can
[1:37:54] spread the gospel to those that are
[1:37:56] around you from the
[1:37:58] kids all the way up to the most elderly
[1:38:02] person we all have a work to do and we
[1:38:05] all are are commissioned to walk through
