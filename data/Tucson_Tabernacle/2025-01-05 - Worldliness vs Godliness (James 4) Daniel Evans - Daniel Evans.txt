talking to brother Daniel a little bit before service he said he had never been so sick with uh whatever it was it is has come by but we have a promise a fulfilled Promise by his stripes we were healed you know sometimes we can look at it and say Lord I but if you can just take him at his word and says lord it's a promise it's already been fulfilled and therefore I'm going to begin to say I am healed I I'm well I'm okay you know well sometimes thank you sometimes it's it takes a little bit to manifest itself but you still take you claim the promise so we uh remember those if you have a

we're in a lot of pain I thank God for his protection sister Amelia on one line there's a lot of pain but I'm thanking God for his protection sometimes when things don't go right we're saying Lord

worship team appreciate um all that the team does brother Josiah sister Katie or on vacation this week and uh um and a lot of people have been out sick with the flu um so always continue to remember each other I saw Brother Sam numer when he was when uh he was coming in where are you there you are back there and uh and brother Isaiah Bland with you from Pennsylvania God God bless you welcome visitors and uh I didn't get to greet him on their way in but brother Justin sister Rebecca Lions where are you raise your hand God bless you welcome good to have you and your children I believe Lydia Haley and Chloe welcome God bless you sisters it's it's good to have you and any other visitors that might miss welcome it's it's good to have you all um it's been uh brother Aaron mentioned that it's uh this has been a rough week uh I was as sick as I've ever been um and uh I I went Sunday afternoon after church I went and I took the time to go and visit some of the people that are in the hospital and pray for them a lot of people had the flu a lot of people were admitted with dehydration or or whatever it might be and uh I I never want to be unthankful but I received something too I got the flu yeah and uh and I'll tell you what when you get it you can really you can really enter into somebody else's suffering when they have it so don't I mean when we get sick it's it's not always a it's a bad thing but it's it can always be for the the glory of God so we want to give him glory in in all things I um I was talking with sister Amelia's son yesterday brother Adam he's incarcerated in Florence and he they get a phone call every once in a while and he he called me yesterday and he uh he was giving me testimony about how that he got kicked out of a group that he was worshiping with and he's he made him feel kind of bad I said my brother Adam I said what would you do to get kicked out and you know it's it's always I'm always looking at trying to look at both sides and and he really did and he said brother Daniel he says I didn't do anything he said they looked into they did some checking on me and how I believed and and they said that they just didn't want to have someone that believed like me fellowshipping with them and uh I said I said you sure and he said he said yeah he said I uh I was praying and he said the Lord told me three things and I'm always I always tell people use caution when you say the Lord told me me because what you are saying is thus sayeth the Lord that God said this this I I really believe the Lord did tell brother Adam this and he gave him these three instructions he said don't argue don't complain and don't defend yourself with these groups and Adam went into that um went into those groups and with that attitude and tell you that is the right way to be we don't have to always defend ourselves we don't have to always argue our positions what we can do is we can find common ground in this book which is Jesus Christ and if we can't find that Common Ground then there is something seriously wrong it doesn't have to be I'm not saying it's wrong with us but it it is wrong if we cannot meet together on the foundation of Jesus Christ so I I thought that was I thought I would I'd like to tell the church that um that the Lord did show him that don't argue don't complain and don't defend yourself because then sometimes it it turns into these NeverEnding arguments and it just doesn't do any good for the visitors we've uh been going through the Book of James and uh we we started uh about a month ago I guess uh James chapter 1 and today we are going to get to James chapter 4 little background on James James was the pastor of the church in Jerusalem the First Christian Church and really what looks like the first Christian pastor of course aside from the Lord Jesus and he was his letter was sent out to really these what we would call I guess a Messianic Jew or it's a Jew that they were they were born in Jew they're living as a Jew and then they accepted Jesus Christ and they became the first Christians those are the first Christians they were Jewish people and then they brought the message to the Gentiles and then the Gentiles BR have really spread it throughout the world since that time so James was the pastor of the church at Jerusalem he was also the uh we could call it half brother we could call it Foster brother but he was the brother of the Lord Jesus so they grew up together under the same parents um of course we know that the Lord Jesus was was not made from flesh and blood as as this man James was but they shared the same family and they shared the same um Mom and Dad growing up James chapter 4 we've got through the first three chapters of James now let's go to James chapter 4 and get right into the word this morning and 4 chapter 4 verse1 you know what I'll read uh the first few verses I'll read the first four verses and then we'll go back and uh expound upon them James chapter 4 verse one says this from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your numbers or your members you lust you have not you kill and you desire to have you cannot obtain you fight and War yet you have not because you ask not you ask not or you ask and you receive not because you ask aiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts your adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god wow that is a very profound and Powerful statement from this man Pastor James we start with that first verse from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members NIV version says what causes fights in quarrels among you don't they come from your desires that battle within you we have in our lives as a Christian we have a war going on all the time and that war is between two things it's between our flesh which is the world it's between our flesh and it's between the spirit of God that also dwells within us so is this there's this constant fighting going on and it's it's a battle that doesn't end until we pass from this world and it's a it's a battle that's been here really from the beginning of time and it continues on until now and it's going to be here until that time is no more Paul said in Romans chapter 7 and I'm going to I'm going to read a paraph paraphrase version of this this um because it's it's much easier to understand Paul said in Romans 7:8 he says and I know that nothing good lives in me that is in my sinful nature I want to do what is right but I can't I want to do what is good but I don't I I don't want to do what is wrong but I do it anyway but if I do what I don't want to do I'm not really the one doing wrong it is sin living in me that does it I have discovered this principle of life that when I want to do what is right I inevitably do what is wrong how many can relate to that I want to do what is wrong I inevitably do what is wrong I love God's law with all my heart but there is another Power with in me that is at war with my mind this power makes me a slave to the sin that is still Within Me Oh What a miserable person I am who will free free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death thank God the answer is in Jesus Christ Our Lord so you see how it is in my mind I really want want to obey God's law but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin that was Romans that was a New Living Translation um of Romans chapter 7 verses 18-2 excuse me there is there's this battle and it's going on between it's going on in in us all the time it's there's a desire that wants to be wants to do good but then there's this flesh that also wants to do evil and it's it's within everyone there's no one that doesn't that doesn't have this and whichever is more powerful is the the direction that you're going to go verse two of James 4 says this you lust and you have not you kill and you desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War yet ye have not because you ask not I don't things James is saying that these Christian people that they are actually murdering someone he's saying that they hate someone remember Jesus said that if you hate a man without a CA without a cause you are murdering that person and here James is saying that you that you lust and you have not you that word lust you desire and you don't have it you kill and you and desire to have and you cannot obain you fight and War and and you have not because you ask not English Standard Version of that says you desire and do not have so you murder you covet and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel you you do not have because you do not ask remember the the two Natures that I was talking about we desire things that are not the Lord's will and we Des desire to have those things and it's because we don't receive what we pray for because it's a it's a worldly desire that's coming out in us and we say we we get down and we pray and and ask the Lord Lord please please give me this and I need this I need even even this past week I was laying on my back and I was like Lord I'm just this is awful will you Lord will you just heal me so I can get a back about your business but the Lord saw fit to say no stay there because this is my will I I was my my carnal nature is like why don't you just heal me why don't you just heal me because I got a lot of work to do I got to study I gotta I I got to visit people I got to talk to people on the phone I got to get together Harmony in the desert we got to get all that squared away Lord I'm sick and I can't do anything why don't you just heal me me and he didn't he did slowly and methodically but he did it his way and it wasn't my way I wanted it this because I needed I thought that I needed to get to work and I forget that God's in charge God's Sovereign he is the one that understands and he's the one that knows what we need and he wanted me in bed for those days even though I tried to get up and I tried to get out and this is my will and that is what we should desire is his will his the the worldly the fleshly desires that are within us they cause us to seek worldly things according to our own mind when we really should be saying Lord here's what I want but but I would really rather have your perfect will and that's what the Apostle here or the the pastor here is saying he's saying that that listen seek God's will first you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that that ye may consume it upon your lusts NIV says when you ask you do not receive because you ask with the wrong motive motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures how many times have I talked with people and uh they say oh you know I'd love to I'd love to win the lottery and then I would give 10% to the church keep 90% for myself take a take a100 million dolls and oh you it'd be great I could spend 10 million on the church in fact I'll just give half to the church and I I'll just take the other half for myself and that's the those aren't those aren't the right desires the right desire is to say Lord I want to work I want to do your will I want to be in your will all the time and and whatever you give me I'm going to give you the glory for and the word says that it is by the hard work it is by the sweat of your brow that you're going to make a living and not by not by winning a prize or doing doing something like that it's remember that God he's not obligated to our requests he is God and we are not God he answers our requests that are requested according to his perfect will and not according to our will it's when when we desire something outside of his will we get our fleshly desires and that's when that's when we get in the way of God but we just just Lord put it into your hands here's what the best that I know how here is here is what I think that your will would be Lord if it would be your will then Grant this but if not Lord I'm still going to glorify you wrote this down that prayer is the door for God to accomplish what he wants to do either in me or through me and and that's what prayer is prayer is not to serve ourselves but prayer is to allow that door of God to open up that he might be able to either do something in me a change in me or do something through me to bless other people imagine can you imagine what it would be like to really get the mind of God to really understand the will of God we say it halfhazard Lord thy will be done but can you imagine if we really did get God's will you imagine how great this is the creator of the universe that we're talking about this is the one that gave us life that that gave us eternal life can you imagine actually getting in his mind and actually getting in his will and and being right there to where that you know that that you are in the perfect will of God can you imagine how great that would be to really know that you are in God's will you would be willing to suffer you would be willing to to give everything you would be willing to do anything if you could just find that perfect will of God and then he goes on and he says you adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship ship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God what does that mean what does that mean to be the friend of a world I of the world I know that probably all of us have read that scripture and all of us have probably sat and contemplated what does that mean to be a friend of the world is hatred with God is division with God so what does that mean to if you're a friend of the world does that mean that I'm not supposed to have worldly friends and then how do we Define worldly does that mean that I'm not supposed to that I'm just supposed to hold up in in a in a in a just a group of what I would call Believers and then we could have just just us there and we just keep all the world out is that is that what that means or does it mean mean or does it mean that that I am just to to go to work and not fellowship with anybody and then come home and just keep completely separate what ises what does that mean you can't we cannot completely separate ourselves from the world people try to but I don't believe that that is God's perfect will we have to go to work we have to go to school and most importantly we also have to be a witness of Jesus Christ to other people so if we are trying to hold ourselves up in in a little group or a or a cult and just to separate ourselves completely from the world then you will see and many have seen the sin will rise up right in the middle of that cult it'll rise up right in the middle of those people who thought that they were separating themselves from the world and sin will come out of those people and then it becomes worse than if we wouldn't have separated ourselves in that way it was never the case that we were supposed to form a little sect and to completely separate ourselves that was the opposite of Christianity Christianity came and he said go tell the world about me he said go out and and and tell them that Jesus Christ Christ is risen from the dead so how how can we separate ourselves from the world and then yet live within this world and still be a witness Jesus said as I said he said go ye into all the world and preach this gospel so there's there's the question with James and he's he's he's saying here he's saying don't be a friend of the world because that is hatred with God so what's the answer how how do we do that I had a friend still have a friend he's a um when we were younger he uh believe I was married and um he started dating this young lady and she just wasn't you could tell you know and me being his friend I was like man you sure you want to date this girl and she was one of the she was the girl that looked theart she looked like what the world would call beautiful she acted she held herself in a way that the world would call attractive but you could see it in this young lady that this was not bro this is not where you want to go and yet he said no yeah no I like her and you know we were made for each other and and they ended up getting married and it was trouble from day one and it was because my friend he wanted this type of girl because that represented his desire and his desire was for the world and here is the separation if his desire would have been to please God if his desire would have been to have a have a nice Godly family then he would have moved in a different direction but no he went in the direction of this young lady they got married she ended up getting her degree she left um during covid she left to go on a uh she was a nurse she left to go to New York on a um a traveling assignment you know when they were making big money back then she left and making lots of money there and and she left her her husband and her and her children back home with the plans to come back home she liked that worldly influence she liked living that worldly that worldly life she liked going out with the friends after work and and going to the bars and drinking and and having fun and laughing and and doing those things that's what she desired she liked that money scene she liked that that social scene it was something that she that was inside of her she had that love of the world she was a friend of the world that's what she wanted and then he is back home and of course it led to Affairs and it led to a divorce and now look at the whole situation the whole situation is that that she went exactly where we all knew that she was going to go she went that direction and now he's has a broken life a broken marriage and all kinds of of problems but because he was the first one he wanted that that was his picture of what he wanted was the world and then she her picture was what she wanted in the world it was a friend of the world that that's what they want to identify with with the things of the world but then there's others that they don't want that they may make the mistake but they they they don't have that desire of a my nephew um Joshua Carroll David's or uh Stephanie's Brother David his son I was talking to him the other day and he's going to the U OFA and I'm a graduate of the U OFA I'm not saying that he shouldn't go to the university but he's he's going there and is like Uncle Dan I just I can't stand it he said pushing all the transgender stuff and and he said all of the the promiscuity and everything that is is surrounding me he says I just can't stand it he says and he's a smart kid he he wants to go to school so he's quitting the university and he's going to go to a Christian school now so proud of the young man he says I just don't want to be part of that he doesn't want to be a friend of the world he wants to separate himself he's a good young man he's he's living a good life and he's he's he's he's trying and he just can't stand it and that's how we should be brothers and sisters we should of course have a burden for the world but when it comes to being a friend of the world when it becomes to identifying with the world we can't do it we've got to be able to separate ourselves I remember when I was about that age and it was on my 21st birthday I was you know I wasn't living for the Lord my friends took me out to the bar and and I was sitting there and and uh all of these women around and the and the and the the men and and doing what they do and at the club and and I was sitting there and and there was a the beer somebody had bought me was sitting on the on the counter and I looked at it and I felt odd thing I felt the sweet presence of the Holy Spirit come down and I looked at that thing and I said Lord even here even in this awful place you came in to this club with me and here I am not serving you not doing right and there is that drink sitting on the on the table and I I said Lord UI would even come in here with me your holy presence and I said 'lord I I don't want this this isn't something I want to identify with this isn't something that that that I want to be part of I don't want to be friends with the world so I went home that night and that is the the day in my life that I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus on my 21st birthday that night when I got home Lord I don't want to I don't want any part of it I don't want to be friends with the world and I separated myself and this then you know what the lord gave me better friends he gave me he he put two of my old friends that I grew up with a Baptist friend named Jeff Brown and a and a Mormon friend named Sean lanquist brought them back into my life and we had more fun being Christians than any of those guys out there drinking and making themselves sick and spending all their money we had we had a we had a lot of fun we were always hunting and fishing and playing and laughing and going to um going to the U OFA games we were part of the University we had a good time and we lived right and it was because I didn't want to be friends with the world I needed to make make a separation there I was just I so proud of Joshua my my nephew he just doesn't want it it's it's not in him he wants to serve god let's keep going remember the godliness you want to be we're trying to separate godliness and worldliness here godliness will sacrifice self and worldliness will promote self Romans 12: vers one says this I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say through the the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God ha dealt to every man The Measure of Faith he's saying make your life a living sacrifice don't conform to this world there's this thing remember I said there's pulling back and forth all the time and which way am I going to go and when I was a young man when I was my son's age it was I was pulled this way and pulled this way and finally I was like no I'm not going that way I'm finished with it I want God in my life I want the Lord Jesus to come out of me I don't want to be part of this world but it doesn't mean that I didn't have to continue to go to school I didn't have to continue to go to work I still did but my life changed then 1 Corinthians we're taking communion tonight 1 cor Corinthians chapter 11 says this verse 28 it says but a let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep so it's not just affecting when we go that worldly route when we want to conform to the world we're not just affecting ourselves but we're affecting others and there are many that could be healed or there are many that that could come out of depression or whatever it might be that don't because of the influences of the world for he that D eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we judge would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together eat to to eat Terry one for another he's talking about the communion back to verse 32 that we should not be condemned with the world if you're a friend of the world or part of the world then of course you will be condemned with the world when that condemnation comes and it's coming it's promised to come so if you want to live that life then you will be condemned with the world because you you have made the the conscious choice to be part of the world when that condemnation comes you will be condemned but we should examine ourselves as the Apostle Paul is saying examine yourself and say Lord am I in your will and it doesn't have to be I'm not just talking about going to the clubs it could be Church it could be whatever it is am I doing this just to be the popular one am I doing this just because this is the way that my church thinks am I doing this just because this is the way that that they do at work no I don't want to be part of that I want to stand alone with Jesus Christ him and me together him speaking to me and saying move forward in this way and then I will bless you let's go back to James chapter 4 verse 5 it says this do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in US lust to Envy English Standard Version says or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the scripture says he yearns jealous jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in US NIV says he jealously Longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us he jealously long jealous jealously Longs for that spirit that he has put in US but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resists the proud but giveth grace to the humble look at the context he's not telling us to join he's not telling us not to join with the world not to have worldly Ambitions but he's saying to make your Ambitions of things that are above he's not he's telling us not to he's saying he's saying don't have the Ambitions that the world has but have the Ambitions of things of Colossians 3:2 set your says set your Ambitions set your minds on things that are above and not things that are on the earth remember God loves a humble heart brothers and sisters he loves a repen of Heart And he as much as he loves that humble heart he also hates a proud heart he hates pride and being humble really is the way way to submit yourselves to God submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you other translations say humble yourself before God resist the devil and he will flee from you we always quote the second part to resist the devil and he will flee from you but the first part says humble yourself before God there's that part go goes along with the second part too we're always fighting the devil and and getting away get trying to get away from him but we also have to Humble ourselves and get rid of that proud arrogant spirit that and with with a that proud and arrogant Spirit we will never be able to resist the devil the first part of it humble yourself before God and then resist the devil the devil is full of Pride and then God hates Pride first we go to the Lord with humility and we say Lord I am nothing and I know nothing I humble myself before you in the name of Jesus Christ and then name your sins to the Lord specifically say Lord here's what I've done here here's the mistakes that I've made will you forgive me and so many of us fall into that trap of saying Lord forgive me of all my sins that doesn't really that's not really that doesn't get it have you had somebody ever had someone come to you maybe before communion and say um forgive me for everything I've done to you wrong that doesn't mean anything you know what I'm saying that person that knows what they're mean what they mean but it doesn't really mean anything when someone says if I've ever offended you please forgive me that doesn't that doesn't mean it what you need to do is you go to that person and say I lied about you I did this wrong to you and I'm sorry will you forgive me then it means something and it's the same when we're going before God we say Lord I did this wrong and I'm sorry please forgive me and you'll have you'll other people you'll you'll see that they'll they'll say you know I've done I've done a lot wrong and I want the church to forgive me that's not that doesn't count it's it's not it's not something that that means it's it's just meaningless words but when we come to when we come to each other and we say that that we've we've hurt or or or done something specifically then that that's has some meaning behind it and I'm not talking talking about like you know if you go and you say you know I don't like brother Daniel's beard because it makes him look old and fat don't come to me and tell me you said that because that's not going to do any good it's just going to make me feel bad but but you can go to the person and say you know I really shouldn't have said that I mean it does but I'm should I really shouldn't have said that and and and then that's you have to have some wisdom before you're coming back to everyone and you're saying Oh I said this about you and that about you if it did the person harm then yes go to the person and and con and confess them but otherwise go to the person that you told and say you know I shouldn't have said that about brother Daniel it was disrespectful albe it it may have been true but it was it wasn't respectful and that's not the way that we talk about each other verse number eight draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep and let your let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaveness that it sounds it sounds like a rough thing to say be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness he's saying mourn over your sins when you were once making fun of Walking with God turn around and mourn over what you did God values that repentance I'll tell you what I love when I see especially I see it so often in the youth when they just there's this Sweetness in their hearts when they're really feeling repentance I remember when I was there I remember when I was going to the university there was a there was a building that would stay open I had a night class and I had a few hours in between um my classes and I would go into this it was i' go to this bathroom and I would pray during that time and I wouldn't change that time for I would I wouldn't trade it for anything anything there was a time that I I was in there and I was just this young man and I was I was repenting of of of doing wrong and Lord I Want to Be Right and and I was asking him Lord I want one day to get married and and would you give me a wife and I want a good job and and and I want to just do better I want to serve you more and I can just imagine how much God appreciated that young man going into that bathroom and praying all of those prayers and I I wish I could go back to me in my age now and say son the Lord appreciate your efforts the Lord he sees all that you're trying to do instead of trying to give all the correction and all the all the rebuke and and those things are warranted and those things are needed but sometimes it's just like I see that you're trying that means more than anything that you could ever do and I think the Lord appreciates he appreciates it he appreciates when we when we go before him and we ask we ask him Lord help me I read that again draw an ey to God and He will draw an nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep and let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up speak not evil one of another Brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judges his brother speaketh evil of the law and judges the law but if the law but if thou judge the law Thou Art not a doer of the law but a judge there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judges another go to now ye let's say today or tomorrow we will go in such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what you shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is but a it is even a vapor that appear for a little while and then vanisheth away I love when I'm out fishing and I love that morning fog that that lays across the water and but soon it just goes away and it's it's it's gone when the sun comes up and that's how our lives are that's what James is saying he's saying that that your life really it's here and it's gone and we make plans when we're young or even when we're older that well we're going to I'm going to get this new job and and I'm going to this is what I'm going to do and I'm going to be successful and this is how I'm going to have this type of family and we're going to have a big house and we're going to live in this city and all of these plans that we make what we should be saying is if the Lord Wills I want to do this I want to be in God's will first and then if I can get in God's will then all of the the joy and the blessings are going to be there but instead of looking towards the worldly things and being a a friend of the world as he said earlier no Lord I want your will I want to do what your will is and then Lord you will bless me but the most important thing is you father and that's how we should live our lives to we want to serve God we want to please God but you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that but now you rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil therefore to him that knoweth to do go good and doeth it not to him it is sin and that's how he closes this chapter and we think about how our lives and how these decisions are made in our lives and this is what the Book of James is it's just helping us to make right decisions in our lives that are going to to lead us through life I remember when uh when James says here at the end he says that um to therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth not to him it is sin James is talking about two types of sins earlier we have he's talking about sins that we have committed in our lives things that we have done and then James now he says now that's not the only sin there are also sins because you have omitted things you have committed sins and then you have sin because you have omitted doing things in your life I remember when I was um soon after I was married I I was on a trip to Portland it was Portland Oregon and uh I had meetings during the day and then the evening I was off and I uh I was walking to the Rose Garden there um to get food and I saw this man walking towards me and I knew exactly what was going on this was this was in the 90s and uh or no this was yeah no this was early 2000 um and I knew exactly what was wrong with this man he was obviously homeless and he was walking in obviously in a lot of pain and he walked by me as as he was I was walking this way he was walking this way and I took a breath and I held my breath and I walked by the man and he says he says um can I talk to you for a minute and I just shook my head and I kept walking and then he said behind me he says I'm dying of AIDS he says can you help me and I just shook my head and I kept walking and I knew to do something right there but I omitted it and it was sin for me not to do it I should have stopped I should have at least I I could have given him some money but I should have prayed for the young man but I didn't I just kept walking I regret that to this day I I walked I don't know maybe F maybe two minutes and then I said Lord I'm sorry and I turned around and I went back to try to find him and I couldn't find man anymore and I regretted that to this very day I regret not doing doing something that was a sin of omission I knew to do it and I didn't do it but then there are other times when you do it and I think it could have been that same trip and I'll tell this this is a pretty amazing story is I was on Southwest Airlines and Southwest is I think that they're starting to assign seats now but Southwest has three and three um on on each side of the aisle and you're not you're assigned a a uh Zone that you can you can enter so you you can be in group one a group that you can go in group one group two whatever it is so I was on a completely packed flight and I think I was going to San to um not San Francisco I think I was going to um somewhere around there and I I had the best seat on the whole plane and there was not one seat open open there was three seats on this side and three seats on this side I was on the very front row aisle seat I could put my feet up and it was just it was like this is this is great and I had on the side of me I had two little people it was this elderly man and this woman so this great for they were there and then on this side there was um a man and his wife and their their young son who is probably I don't know five or six years old and then they had a baby and the baby was I think like two and I'm I'm sitting there and and the whole plane is packed and I'm like yes this is good I got my book I'm going to read it and um the flight attendant starts arguing with a man sitting next to me across the aisle and she says um you can't you can't all four sit in these seats one of you is going to have to go back um to an open seat in the back of the plane and the um the guy was like no no no you can't we just hold the baby and he says no the flighton says no you have to have an open seat for that child and I was like oh man this is not going to end good for [Music] me this argument has nothing to do with these people this is all about me and I'm sitting there and he's he's arguing back and forth and finally he says okay fine I'll go and I was like no man I said I'll go back let me let me go back and you sit with your family and I's like oh wow thank you so much so I didn't sin I I followed the leading of the Lord so then I go back I get my backpack and I'm like man it stinks so I'm I'm going going back and she's like oh thank you so much um the seats uh um 23b I was like oh no number one B I know where B is and number two it's at the very back so I get my backpack and I'm going through and and I look and oh there's 23 B and there's this big sweaty white man I mean heavy set and I'm like oh no and he's next to the window and then there's this um big broad shouldered um black man that uh was sitting in the other seat and he's big too and and uh he he struck me because he had a like he he he had a special Aura to him his hair was done in a certain way and he he was just a he's a nicel looking guy and and the big guy and there's the big guy here and big guy there and there's this little seat in between them and I'm a not a small guy so I was like hey I got to sit there sorry so so I sit down and uh I'm open up my book which is Prince the House of David and I start reading reading that and I don't know has anybody ever read that book tremendous wonderful book and I'm reading this and then the black guy he looks over my shoulder and he looks at the book I'm reading and he says uh he says 'what are you reading and I said oh it's a it's a story about the life of Jesus and and he uh he says tells me he says he says I'm searching and I said really he says yeah he says um he says I'm searching he says I've gone from church to church and he says every church that I go to he says it's it's it's just lifting up the pastor or it's just trying to get their hands in my pocket he says it's never about the real thing and he says this and he made this this statement that's gives me chills today he says I want something that's true from Genesis to Revelation I was like Wow amen and and he said Revelation which to me he said okay he's he's a bit educated most people would say Revelations and I so I reached in my backpack and I gave him the book um William brandom a man sent from God and I said here I said this is really if you like to read this is something that has been a blessing to me and we talked for a little while and then when he when we left when we started going out I thought man this is i' really like to talk to this guy again I want to get his number or something so we when we left um I looked for him in the airport I couldn't find him so then it's like oh well wow that was amazing and that guy just the words that he said and I thought after that was that even real did that even really happen was that man a real man and I thought from that time I thought you know what I think I talked to an angel on that plane and it was it was because it was just the most amazing conversation he was the most amazing man so then speaking of following The Obedience of God that was something that was on my mind always for 20 over 20 years I was um about I don't know five six years ago I was laying in bed and I was watching um this these Street Preachers on YouTube and not not the ones that just Heckle and tell everybody they're going to hell but but the ones that were actually doing something and I and I saw this guy and he was preaching to these really rough people in uh in um Vancouver Washington in the rough area the drug area Vancouver and what had happened is as he was preaching on the street he got a following of um a a bunch of um homosexual people that were heckling him and he he just kept on preaching and and he and the this the group of people get to the coast and then many of these that he had been preaching to wanted to be baptized and here is this man and it struck me as one of the most powerful moments and I'll show the video sometime one of the most powerful moments that this man was there in the water and they're spraying Silly String at him and and these these crossdressing people are splashing water on him and here is this man and he has these people that he's baptizing and he's he's getting hit in the face with a silly string and in the water and he baptizes him I notice he baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ and puts him up and the and the people were just so excited to be delivered and as I was watching this I thought man that guy looks familiar and I thought it couldn't be his hair was done the same way and this is 20 years earlier the time on the plane and I I watched him I said man it looks like him and I got his phone number I got his his email address I got I was able to track down the contact information and he said he responded and he says yeah I vaguely remember that he says I remember being on the plane and he says I was traveling forth back and forth he says I was in seminary at that time time and it's not that what I said had any in influence on him but it was just the obedience that I had to leave my seat and to go back then I was able to meet this young man who was about my age and who was really searching for the Lord two young men there are searching for the Lord who would take different paths in life and then come back around and be reunited again through email it was just an amazing time and it was because I was obedient to the Lord Lord and not because that I was disobedient as I had been earlier with that homeless man and I I regret that I wish I could have it back but I learned a lesson never to do it Daniel you can come in in closing so brother and sisters with brothers and sisters with James and with being a friend of the world James is trying to tell us that make set your affections on things above to to look to the Lord Jesus and to serve him and to let that dictate every way that you do things and and how that you want to live your life not being a friend of the world but being a servant of God and that is James that's through James chapter 4 and uh I thank God that I got through it because I was uh I feel like the sickness hit me again up here in the Pulpit but the Lord the lord gave us gave me strength to get through Daniel I sought the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from every fear and those look on him are radi there'll never be ashamed they'll never be ashamed this poor man cry and the Lord heard me and save me from my enies the Son of God surrounds his Saints he will deliver them he will deliver them oh magnify the Lord with me and come exalt his name together oh [Music] glorify the Lord with me and come exalt his name forever ever oh taste and see that the Lord is good and blessed is he who hides in him oh fear the lord oh all you Saints he'll give you everything he'll give you everything oh magnify the Lord with me and come exalt his name together all glorify the Lord with me and come exalt his name forever let us bless the Lord every day and night

enemy fought me so hard being being up here in this this morning I've never I've never been fought like that and I know it was it was the sickness that was trying to manifest itself again but we claim I I I preached last week on every step that you take in this world is your possession as Joshua crossed over Jordan every possess every place that they took it was their possession but they had to fight for every inch of it and that's how we are we fight for every inch that we get and sometimes it's it's uncomfortable to to serve the Lord sometimes it's hard to do what we're doing but continue to do it if if you have if you're placed in a position that the the world is around you and it's hard to get through brothers and sisters remember you are not part of this world you are part of God and you are not friends with the world you are like Abraham you are a friend of God and you can separate yourself you don't have to be um you don't have to form a little cult or form a little group but you can walk through this world led by the Holy Spirit and you can spread the gospel to those that are around you from the kids all the way up to the most elderly person we all have a work to do and we all are are commissioned to walk through this world but not be a friend of the world have a burden for the world but don't be part of it because it always ends in pain it always ends and suffering I told the the story about the friend of mine that made the wrong choice his choice believe was clouded by the things of the world and you young people and who you marry don't let it be clouded by the things of the world follow God trust God God loves [Music] I know it because I know he loved it when I was doing it he loves it when a young person gets on their knees just you and him and talk to him say Lord I just need you to show me I need you to show me what direction to go I need you to show me what job to get I need you to show me who to marry I need you to show me what to do because I'm not able to do it Lord I don't want the things of the world I want the things of God and sister Connie all the way up to us every step you make put him first don't put the things of the world there it's not that's not what you want because it will always end in suffering it'll always end in pain God bless you brothers and sisters let's all [Music] stand you have another song for us
