[0:00] In the city where there never comes a
[0:04] night.
[0:06] I have a mansion over there. And when
[0:09] free from to care, I am going where the
[0:13] lamb is the light.
[0:17] There's a country far beyond the starry
[0:20] sky.
[0:23] There's a city where there never comes a
[0:26] night.
[0:28] If we're faithful, we should go there by
[0:31] and by.
[0:34] It is the city where the lamb is light.
[0:39] And in that city where the lamb is
[0:43] alive,
[0:45] in the city where there never comes a
[0:48] night.
[0:50] And I have a mansion over there. And
[0:54] when free from toil and care, I am going
[0:57] where the lamb is the light.
[1:02] Here we have our days in the sunshine.
[1:05] But we know
[1:07] that the sun which shines upon us now so
[1:11] bright
[1:12] [Music]
[1:18] into the city where the lamb is light.
[1:24] In the city where the lamb is light.
[1:30] In the city where there never comes a
[1:33] night
[1:35] and I have a mansion over there and when
[1:39] free from to care I am going where the
[1:43] lamb is alive
[1:46] there'll be flowers bloom forever and
[1:50] the day
[1:52] shall be one eternal day without a night
[1:58] and our tears shall be forever. forever
[2:00] wiped away.
[2:03] In that city where the lamb is light.
[2:09] In that city where the lamb is light.
[2:14] In that city where there cometh no
[2:18] night.
[2:20] And I have a mansion over there. And
[2:23] when free from toil and care, I am going
[2:27] where the lamb is a light.
[2:31] Here we have our disappointments all the
[2:34] while.
[2:37] And our fondest hopes but meet with
[2:39] bitter blight.
[2:42] Though by night we weep, the morning
[2:45] brings a smile.
[2:48] In that city where the lamb is light.
[2:53] In the city where the lamb is light.
[2:59] In the city where there cometh no night.
[3:04] And I have a mansion over there. And
[3:07] when free from toil and care I am going
[3:11] where the lamb is the light.
[3:15] Then let the sunshine fate. Let twilight
[3:18] bring its gloom.
[3:21] Not a shadow can my blissful soul of
[3:24] fright.
[3:27] For I know that up in heaven there is
[3:30] room.
[3:32] In that city where the lamb is light.
[3:38] In the city where the lamb is alive.
[3:43] In the city where there cometh no night
[3:48] and I have a mansion over there and when
[3:52] free from toll and care I am going where
[3:56] the lamb is alive.
[4:00] Amen. Are you happy to be in church on a
[4:02] Wednesday night? I know I am.
[4:08] If we could stand this evening.
[4:12] When I think of the goodness of Jesus
[4:18] and all he has done for me.
[4:23] My soul cries out hallelujah.
[4:28] Praise God for saving me.
[4:34] Oh, when I think of the goodness of
[4:38] Jesus
[4:40] and all he has done for me,
[4:46] my soul cries out, hallelujah.
[4:51] Oh, praise God for saving me.
[4:56] Oh, when I think of the goodness of
[5:00] Jesus
[5:02] and all he has done for me,
[5:08] my soul cries out, "Hallelujah!
[5:14] Praise God for saving me."
[5:19] I love that song.
[5:26] [Music]
[5:29] Once my soul
[5:32] was astray
[5:34] from the heavenly
[5:37] way
[5:39] and was wretched
[5:42] in vow
[5:44] as could be.
[5:49] My savior
[5:51] above.
[5:53] Gave me peace,
[5:55] joy, and love.
[5:58] When he reached down his hand
[6:02] for me.
[6:07] When he reached
[6:09] down his hand for me.
[6:13] [Music]
[6:16] when he reached
[6:18] down his hand
[6:21] for me.
[6:25] And I was lost
[6:27] and undone
[6:30] without God
[6:32] or his son
[6:34] when he reached down his hand
[6:39] for me.
[6:43] And I was near
[6:46] in despair
[6:48] when he came to me
[6:53] and he showed
[6:55] me that I
[6:57] could be free.
[7:02] But then he lifted
[7:05] my feet and gave me gloryy
[7:10] complete
[7:12] when he reached
[7:14] down his hand
[7:16] for me.
[7:20] Oh, when he reached
[7:23] down his hand for me.
[7:27] [Music]
[7:30] When he reached
[7:32] down his hand for me,
[7:39] I was lost
[7:42] and undone
[7:44] without God
[7:46] or his son.
[7:49] When he reach
[7:51] down his hand
[7:53] for me.
[7:55] [Music]
[7:57] And when he reached
[8:00] down his hand for me.
[8:07] When he reached
[8:09] down his hand for me.
[8:16] I was lost
[8:18] and undone
[8:21] without God
[8:23] or his son
[8:25] when he reach
[8:28] down his hand
[8:30] for me.
[8:33] You may be seated.
[8:35] [Music]
[8:42] And once I was clothed.
[8:49] [Music]
[8:51] Oh yes,
[8:54] I'm a child
[8:56] of the king.
[8:59] His royal blood
[9:03] now flows through my veins.
[9:07] And I
[9:09] who is wretched
[9:12] and vile
[9:14] now can sing.
[9:16] Praise God.
[9:18] Praise God.
[9:21] I'm a child of the King.
[9:31] [Music]
[9:34] I forgot the verses. Everybody,
[9:38] we're going to move on to the next song.
[9:39] We're going to say, "Create in me a
[9:41] clean heart.
[9:46] Create in me a clean
[9:51] heart.
[9:54] Oh
[9:56] God,
[10:00] and renew a right spirit
[10:04] within me.
[10:10] [Music]
[10:11] Create in me a clean
[10:16] heart,
[10:20] oh God.
[10:25] and renew my spirit
[10:29] within
[10:30] me.
[10:32] [Music]
[10:36] Cast me not away
[10:40] from thy presence,
[10:44] oh Lord,
[10:48] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[10:59] Restore
[11:01] unto me
[11:05] the joy of thy salvation.
[11:12] And renew a right spirit within me.
[11:19] [Music]
[11:23] Create in me a clean heart.
[11:31] Oh God,
[11:36] and renew a right spirit within me.
[11:45] [Music]
[11:46] Create in me a clean heart,
[11:54] oh God.
[11:59] and renew a right spirit
[12:02] within me.
[12:05] [Music]
[12:09] Oh, cast me not away
[12:14] from thy presence,
[12:18] oh Lord.
[12:21] Take not thy holy spirit from me.
[12:32] Restore
[12:34] unto me
[12:36] [Music]
[12:38] the joy of thy salvation.
[12:45] and renew arise spirit
[12:49] within me.
[12:58] We could stand this evening.
[13:05] Oh, blessed assures
[13:12] mine.
[13:14] [Music]
[13:16] And oh what a for
[13:19] taste of glory divine
[13:26] and air of salvation
[13:28] [Music]
[13:31] purchased of God.
[13:35] Born of his spirit,
[13:40] washed in his blood.
[13:44] And this is my story.
[13:50] This is my song.
[13:54] Praising my savior
[13:59] all the day long.
[14:03] And this is my story.
[14:06] [Music]
[14:08] This is my song.
[14:12] I'm praising my Savior
[14:17] all the day long.
[14:21] Oh, perfect submission,
[14:27] perfect delight.
[14:29] [Music]
[14:31] In visions of rapure
[14:36] now bursts at my side.
[14:40] And angels descending.
[14:46] Bring from above.
[14:50] Echoes of mercy,
[14:53] [Music]
[14:55] whispers of love.
[14:59] So this is my story.
[15:02] [Music]
[15:04] This is my song.
[15:09] Praising my savior
[15:13] all the day long.
[15:18] This is my story.
[15:23] This is my song.
[15:25] [Music]
[15:27] Praising my savior
[15:32] all the day long.
[15:36] Oh, perfect submission.
[15:41] All is at rest.
[15:44] [Music]
[15:46] I and my Savior
[15:50] am happy and blessed.
[15:55] I'm watching and waiting,
[16:00] looking above.
[16:04] I'm filled with his goodness,
[16:09] lost in his love.
[16:13] So this is my story.
[16:18] This is my song.
[16:22] I'm praising my Savior
[16:27] all the day long.
[16:32] This is my story.
[16:37] This is my song.
[16:41] Praising my savior
[16:46] all the day long.
[16:50] Words that are in that song should
[16:53] always be on our hearts. This is my
[16:56] story and this is my song. Praising my
[16:59] savior all the day long. We're starting
[17:01] a series tonight on praise.
[17:05] The Josiah is going to start it. I'm
[17:09] really looking forward to it. And I want
[17:10] to say a few words. I have you seated
[17:13] for a little while. Um,
[17:16] first of all,
[17:18] first and foremost,
[17:20] Sister Heather, Brother Lyle, it's good
[17:23] to have you back home.
[17:30] I really, really, and I can speak for
[17:32] the whole congregation, I really missed
[17:35] you. We missed you very much. all the
[17:38] love that you have for all of us and all
[17:40] that you do for us and always opening
[17:43] your home and and all of the time that
[17:46] you give with the Sunday school with
[17:48] being a deacon and and a sister deacon
[17:52] and and just all that you do is we're
[17:56] not worthy of the love that you have
[18:00] given to all of us. And we're grateful
[18:02] to have you back home at your poster
[18:04] duty. And yeah,
[18:10] [Applause]
[18:12] brother Joe, Sister Aaron Robson, Robson
[18:14] family, God bless you. It's good to have
[18:16] you in service. I, you know, I think
[18:19] very highly of your family. Very, very
[18:21] good example of good Christian people,
[18:24] the Robson family.
[18:26] I uh today's a sad day
[18:29] and it's it's something that
[18:34] affected
[18:36] I think all of us that know about what
[18:41] happened
[18:42] more than we maybe would have thought
[18:44] that it would have affected us. And
[18:46] that's the death of this young man named
[18:48] Charlie Kirk today. The murder of this
[18:52] man. If you don't know who Charlie Kirk
[18:54] is, he's
[18:58] um probably one of at least one of, if
[19:02] not the most famous
[19:04] conservative Christian influencers in
[19:07] the whole world.
[19:09] and uh he was at a rally or at a um I
[19:14] don't know what you call it when when
[19:15] they all get together and he answers
[19:18] questions, but uh he was murdered by an
[19:21] assassin
[19:22] and Daniel um called me today and and
[19:28] told me and Daniel was shaken up
[19:33] and I I could tell he was fighting back
[19:35] tears and then when he told me the same
[19:38] thing happened to me. have watched this
[19:39] young man many many times and first and
[19:42] foremost in this man's life above
[19:45] everything was he was a Christian and
[19:48] that's the first thing that he would say
[19:50] um when he would have these these um
[19:54] events was that he was a Christian and
[19:56] he he'd preach a little sermon and
[19:59] everything that he did went back to this
[20:01] man Jesus Christ and he stood for it. He
[20:05] he um always had the utmost respect for
[20:10] anyone that would ever talk with him.
[20:12] Some of these people would insult him.
[20:15] And I've seen it on on YouTube how the
[20:18] these liberal kids at these colleges
[20:22] would stand up and do nothing but insult
[20:24] him. And he would treat that person with
[20:26] the utmost respect
[20:28] and answer their question.
[20:31] and and because of his love and because
[20:33] of his wisdom, he would make the person
[20:36] that was insulting him look like a fool
[20:41] and people hated him. Obviously, someone
[20:45] hated him enough to take his life today.
[20:51] And that man,
[20:53] as I said, a young man, wisdom far
[20:55] beyond his years of 31 years old,
[20:58] was a true Christian.
[21:01] that love the Lord.
[21:04] And I see his death.
[21:08] And I think it is time more now
[21:13] than ever to pray for our country
[21:15] because the things that could result in
[21:18] this are things that none of us want.
[21:21] It could start a a big conflict within
[21:26] our country. And I think that we always
[21:30] The Lord taught us to pay to pray for
[21:33] the peace of Jerusalem. And I think that
[21:36] we should always also pray for the pre
[21:38] peace of our country. No one wins
[21:42] when there is an uprising or when there
[21:44] is discord. No one wins.
[21:48] And I do I see this man's death
[21:53] as
[21:54] it's uh it's something that could result
[21:58] if without cool heads it could result in
[22:01] something much worse.
[22:03] So I asked the church that we would pray
[22:05] for the peace of our country
[22:08] and of course pray for this man's his
[22:10] two babies, two young children, a young
[22:14] wife.
[22:15] And he's dedicated he dedicated his life
[22:19] to number one spreading the gospel.
[22:22] And he did it in a way that I don't
[22:25] think anyone has ever done it before.
[22:28] He's he was a a political person on the
[22:32] of course on the conservative side, but
[22:34] he took his gift of being able to be so
[22:38] quick in answering these questions and
[22:40] be so quick in in giving a response and
[22:43] and so learned in things and he took
[22:46] that gift and he also used it to do
[22:49] something far greater than standing for
[22:51] the Republican party. He used it to lift
[22:54] up Jesus Christ.
[22:56] He was a true Christian. And I believe
[22:59] our country lost one of the greatest men
[23:03] that are in this country today in this
[23:06] man named Charlie Kirk.
[23:09] I
[23:11] when I heard as I said I almost couldn't
[23:14] fight back the tears
[23:18] because if you ever saw him he was a
[23:20] kind man
[23:22] and he really believed what he preached.
[23:27] As I was
[23:30] talking to uh brother John, brother John
[23:33] Ler, he reminded me of a scripture
[23:36] that I'd like to read and I think that
[23:41] it describes
[23:44] this young man, Charlie Kirk.
[23:48] told
[23:49] most of the people that asked me about
[23:51] it today.
[23:53] I said, 'Carlie has gone on to his
[23:55] reward
[23:56] and he has a great reward for all that
[23:59] he did and the using his gifts to
[24:03] influence
[24:05] people to live holy lives, to abstain
[24:09] from immorality,
[24:12] to focus on the Bible, focus on Christ,
[24:16] and to live a conservative lifestyle.
[24:20] And just his his wisdom was so great
[24:22] that he was able to sway people in a
[24:26] certain way.
[24:29] And
[24:31] as I said, a great man in my opinion.
[24:37] Brother John
[24:39] quoted a scripture to me and I think it
[24:41] would be good that if we would all read
[24:44] it.
[24:46] It's in Romans chapter 8. Verse
[24:51] number
[24:58] start with verse number 35.
[25:01] Romans 8:35
[25:07] says this,
[25:09] "Who shall separate us from the love of
[25:12] Christ?
[25:14] shall tribulation or distress or
[25:16] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[25:18] peril or sword
[25:21] as it is written.
[25:24] He's quoting I believe the psalm here
[25:29] as it is written for thy sake
[25:33] we are killed all the day long
[25:37] we are accounted as sheep for the
[25:40] slaughter.
[25:42] This man, Charlie Kirk, was murdered
[25:47] for making a stand on what is right.
[25:52] But we can rest assured, and I wish I
[25:54] could shake his wife's hand and tell his
[25:58] wife, and I'm sure so many people are
[26:00] telling her this, and his and and his
[26:03] children when they get old enough, that
[26:06] your father did great things.
[26:09] Now listen to this.
[26:12] Nay, in all these things
[26:15] we are more than conquerors through him
[26:17] that loved us. For I am persuaded that
[26:21] neither death nor life, nor angels, nor
[26:23] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[26:25] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[26:27] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[26:30] be able to separate us from the love of
[26:32] God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[26:36] This man may be dead.
[26:39] His time was finished. God saw fit
[26:43] to allow him to be taken. And I believe
[26:45] it was perfect timing. I believe the
[26:48] Lord, he finished his work
[26:52] and the Lord pulled him out of this
[26:55] world and he left his family, left his
[27:00] wife and his children. And I and I think
[27:01] that and I hope I know that there are
[27:07] churches and Christians around the world
[27:10] that are praying for his wife and his
[27:12] children. But he went on to his reward.
[27:16] And the Bible says here he it says that
[27:18] as is written for thy sake we are killed
[27:20] all the day long. He was killed for the
[27:22] sake of Jesus Christ. And anytime,
[27:25] friends, anytime that you truly preach
[27:29] this Bible and you preach Jesus Christ,
[27:32] you will be hated by some.
[27:36] The apostles Peter and Paul, they asked
[27:39] for boldness
[27:41] to preach this book. They asked for
[27:44] boldness to preach this man, Jesus
[27:47] Christ. And I think today in this year
[27:49] of 2025, we need more boldness than ever
[27:53] to continue to preach this man, Jesus
[27:56] Christ, because Jesus says saves the
[27:58] same today as he did 2,000 years ago.
[28:01] And he should always be our focus and he
[28:04] will always be the focus of this pulpit
[28:06] and always be the focus of this man as
[28:08] long as I stand here is focus on that
[28:11] man, Jesus Christ. He never fails.
[28:15] And because of him, this man, I believe,
[28:19] is saved and in glory today.
[28:22] And I pray that his that the Holy Spirit
[28:26] will always guide his family and protect
[28:28] them from this point on. As I said, as
[28:31] you can tell,
[28:33] it's a sad thing what happened today.
[28:37] And I believe he was a great man.
[28:42] So when we pray tonight
[28:45] um let's also remember
[28:48] I have a praise I have a praise now and
[28:52] and God is good. God will take this and
[28:55] he'll turn it around
[28:57] and he'll make it for the good. I mean,
[28:58] if you keep reading or if you read just
[29:00] a few verses before of what I just read,
[29:03] the most one of the most famous
[29:04] chapters, the most famous verses in the
[29:06] whole Bible is Romans 8:28
[29:10] that all things work together for the
[29:12] good to them that love God, to them who
[29:15] are called accord called according to
[29:18] his purpose.
[29:20] All all of it's right and it's just
[29:22] going on. God has this great plan and
[29:24] it's just moving forward. And I believe
[29:27] that this is just another step for this
[29:29] country to make. And I hope that they
[29:32] make the right step. I hope that they
[29:34] look to this tragedy that happened
[29:37] today. And I hope that it makes people
[29:40] think about the Lord Jesus and that our
[29:42] lives are finite. Our lives could end.
[29:46] At any moment,
[29:48] the Lord could just as as it said,
[29:52] Brother Brandham said one time, pull our
[29:54] card from the rack. It could be any it
[29:56] could be anytime. I pray that the this
[29:58] whole country
[30:00] examines themselves and and says, "Is
[30:03] this the kind of country you want of
[30:05] violence, hatred, and of discord?" Or
[30:09] maybe look to this man, Jesus Christ,
[30:11] and that's where we will find unity.
[30:15] Um, Sister Amelia has a praise report.
[30:19] She says this, "I had a dentist
[30:21] appointment today and I have a few
[30:24] cavities."
[30:26] Sister Ameilia,
[30:30] floss, brush, no sugar.
[30:34] I'll get to the rest of it.
[30:39] Had they not been able to take the
[30:41] cavities out,
[30:45] it would have had to have a root I would
[30:48] have had to have a root canal done. But
[30:50] everything turned out good. Praise the
[30:53] Lord. We all go through this. I'll tell
[30:56] you what, our teeth are so important and
[31:01] you can have the worst day of your life
[31:03] if you get a toothache. So, and all of
[31:06] us and it's so expensive and all that,
[31:08] but sister sister Ameilia gives praise
[31:11] that that the Lord took care of her and
[31:13] also she had some blood work done last
[31:16] week and this week she got good results
[31:20] and everything is good. Praise the Lord.
[31:28] Let's all stand.
[31:34] Sister Izzy, young Izzy, very proud of
[31:37] you. I was I was walking out of my
[31:40] office and s and young Izzy was walking
[31:42] in and I could see that she had a burden
[31:46] on her shoulders and and uh I love to
[31:50] see this in young people. She said that
[31:54] her friend Josh isn't doing so well and
[31:58] and um I know that he's uh he gets
[32:02] depressed. Am I right? Is he Is that
[32:04] what it is? And she's worried about her
[32:07] friend.
[32:08] We should always
[32:11] pray for one another.
[32:13] We should always have a burden for one
[32:15] another. It's not just people in this
[32:17] churches, but everybody everybody that
[32:19] you meet, everybody that you know. I've
[32:23] said it a number of times
[32:26] that you may know something, Brother
[32:28] Joe. It might be somebody at our work.
[32:31] You know, it might be somebody at the
[32:32] office or it might be somebody in school
[32:35] with with Izzy or the kids.
[32:40] You may be the only person
[32:43] that has ever prayed for that person.
[32:47] It's a soul that God knows.
[32:50] And imagine how much the Lord Jesus
[32:52] appreciates it when we pray for one of
[32:55] his children, especially when other
[32:58] people aren't praying for them.
[33:00] So, let's keep this young man Josh
[33:03] in our prayers.
[33:05] And friends, if you have a request on
[33:08] your heart, it's not just something that
[33:09] we do, but it's something that I believe
[33:12] that the Lord sees.
[33:14] You have to make an effort to raise your
[33:18] hand.
[33:21] And then I believe God sees that effort.
[33:24] If you have something on your heart for
[33:26] yourself or for someone else, I ask that
[33:29] you would raise your hand before the
[33:31] Lord Jesus tonight and make it known to
[33:33] him.
[33:35] Let's bow our heads.
[33:39] Our father,
[33:41] Lord, we're grateful that you were so
[33:43] kind to sister Amelia to take care of
[33:46] her teeth
[33:49] and and Lord provide for her. She puts
[33:53] so much trust in you, Father. A a widow
[33:56] that that that
[33:59] doesn't, Lord, that that always
[34:03] appreciates everything that's done for
[34:05] her.
[34:06] Father, we we thank you for always
[34:09] providing for the widows, always
[34:10] providing for your children,
[34:14] for what you did for Sister Amelia
[34:16] today. We thank you.
[34:18] And Lord, we lift up this young man
[34:22] Josh in prayer
[34:25] &gt;&gt; and ask Father that that whatever is
[34:28] missing in his life, whatever void would
[34:30] be there that you would Lord place
[34:34] replace that void, that empty space,
[34:36] replace it with the Holy Spirit, Father.
[34:39] And may this young man truly know Jesus
[34:42] Christ. And and Father, I pray that that
[34:45] you would use young Izzy to lead him to
[34:48] the Almighty God,
[34:50] to yourself.
[34:52] And Father, we pray for the family.
[34:56] This man is Charlie Kirk.
[34:59] pray that you would, Lord, I can only
[35:01] imagine what his wife is going through
[35:03] right now, having lost her husband and
[35:07] and all of the Lord being on
[35:10] being streamed on the internet and and
[35:14] just the Lord the tragedy of it for her.
[35:19] I pray for her, Lord. Pray for his
[35:22] children. They might not know what's
[35:24] going on now,
[35:26] but Father, as they grow, I pray that
[35:28] they would grow
[35:29] under the hand of Jesus Christ.
[35:34] Lord, for our uplifted hands, you saw
[35:36] them.
[35:39] Lord, you're a discerner of the thoughts
[35:40] and intents of the heart. So, you know
[35:43] the sincerity of the hands that went up,
[35:45] and you know why they went up. And
[35:48] father, we pray that you would answer
[35:49] every prayer
[35:52] tonight.
[35:53] Bless our service. Father, as our
[35:56] brother Josiah comes, young man, Lord, I
[36:01] I just I was taken back when I was
[36:03] praying
[36:05] earlier with Daniel and Josiah. Father,
[36:09] it struck me that the age of these two
[36:12] young men and how they're both leading
[36:14] this service tonight.
[36:17] Thank you, Father, for for young people
[36:19] and the young people that are here
[36:21] present that really believe and are
[36:23] really willing to make a stand for for
[36:26] the Lord, for you. Father, I thank you
[36:29] for them.
[36:31] Lord,
[36:32] what a great honor it is that we can
[36:34] come here tonight
[36:37] and have a young man lead worship and
[36:40] another young man bring your word.
[36:43] Thank you, Father. Thank you for this
[36:45] gift.
[36:47] pray that you would be with us tonight
[36:49] and be with Josiah as he ministers in
[36:52] Jesus name. Amen.
[36:58] Peace of God cover me.
[37:06] Cover me.
[37:11] Cover me.
[37:14] [Music]
[37:17] Peace of God, cover me
[37:25] through the storm.
[37:30] Cover me.
[37:35] In peace of God, cover me.
[37:43] Cover me.
[37:47] Cover me.
[37:52] Peace of God. Cover me
[38:00] through the soul.
[38:02] [Music]
[38:04] Cover me.
[38:07] Sing only in you. Only in you I am safe.
[38:17] Only in you I'm secure.
[38:25] Only in you I find peace.
[38:31] So cover me.
[38:37] Cover me.
[38:41] Cover me when I am hurting.
[38:45] Cover me when I'm not strong.
[38:50] Cover me when I am going through the
[38:54] storm.
[38:58] Cover me when all seems hopeless.
[39:02] Cover me when my faith is gone.
[39:06] Let the peace that passes all I
[39:10] understand
[39:14] cover me.
[39:18] Cover me.
[39:22] Would you pray with me?
[39:26] Lord Jesus,
[39:28] we want you to take control of this
[39:32] service. Lord,
[39:34] we don't want this to be a gathering
[39:36] that's centered on us.
[39:39] If it's centered on us, we could have
[39:40] done that at home. Lord, we came here
[39:43] tonight because we wanted to focus on
[39:45] you. We wanted to have a service
[39:48] dedicated to your glory tonight, Lord. I
[39:51] pray that that's what this service would
[39:53] be, dedicated to the glory of God.
[39:59] Pray that your Holy Spirit would be here
[40:01] tonight
[40:03] to deal with each heart. Lord, you know
[40:05] what each person needs.
[40:08] Pray that you'd get the glory from
[40:10] tonight in Jesus name. Amen. What key
[40:13] are we in? Can we go to F?
[40:20] Can you go to the four and then back to
[40:21] the one?
[40:27] Yes, I know.
[40:30] Yes, I know.
[40:33] Jesus blood can make the vi sinner
[40:36] clean.
[40:38] Oh yes I know.
[40:42] Yes I know
[40:45] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[40:48] clean. Sing that again. Yes I know. Oh
[40:50] yes I know.
[40:53] Yes, I know
[40:56] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[41:00] clean.
[41:02] Yes, I know.
[41:05] Yes, I know
[41:08] Jesus blood can make the violence. Sing
[41:12] that one more time. Let me hear you sing
[41:13] it. Oh, and I know.
[41:17] Yes, I know
[41:20] Jesus blood can make the vile sinner
[41:24] clean. And I know, oh, and I know,
[41:29] yes, I know
[41:32] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[41:35] clean.
[41:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you believe
[41:40] that
[41:42] the emphasis isn't on the vilest sinner,
[41:45] but the emphasis is on the blood of
[41:47] Jesus that can make us clean. Do you
[41:49] believe that?
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for playing tonight.
[41:53] Thank you for singing, Daniel. I knew
[41:55] that this was the first night that I've
[41:57] ever got to speak with Daniel song
[42:00] leading because I have handheld two. I
[42:03] always have handheld one. So, there
[42:06] might have been a second delay getting
[42:08] my mic on because of that. Let's read
[42:10] Psalms 100.
[42:18] They're going to put it up on the
[42:19] screen, but if you have a Bible, it's so
[42:22] good to read out of it. I find that when
[42:25] Brother Daniel's preaching, like on
[42:27] Sunday, there was a lot of scripture he
[42:28] read, and if I read it on the screen, I
[42:32] don't remember it as well.
[42:35] So, we have the screen to be helpful.
[42:37] I'm not here to say that there's
[42:39] anything wrong with the screen, but if
[42:41] you have a Bible, I think it'll help you
[42:43] remember the scriptures better, to
[42:46] actually open it up and look down at the
[42:49] words.
[42:50] Let's read this out loud. That's another
[42:53] way to help yourself remember a
[42:54] scripture. Let's read this, the whole
[42:57] psalm, Psalms 100, out loud together.
[43:00] Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all
[43:04] ye lands.
[43:06] Serve the Lord with gladness.
[43:09] Come before his presence with singing.
[43:12] Know ye that the Lord, he is God. It is
[43:17] he that hath made us, and not we
[43:20] ourselves.
[43:22] We are his people and the sheep of his
[43:25] pasture.
[43:27] Enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[43:30] and into his courts with praise. Be
[43:33] thankful unto him and bless his name.
[43:37] For the Lord is good, his mercy is
[43:40] everlasting, and his truth endureth to
[43:44] all generations. Can you say amen? Amen.
[43:48] You can all have your seats.
[43:52] Let me start my timer.
[43:56] If you come on Wednesday night and and
[44:00] I'm up here, I always do my best to just
[44:03] do 30 minutes on Wednesday night. That's
[44:06] the goal. It might it might be 15. Maybe
[44:09] I'll talk fast and it'll all be over,
[44:11] but I'll I'll aim to get everybody out
[44:15] and to get good sleep tonight.
[44:18] So, we're starting this thought. I'm I
[44:21] uh I had it on my heart to talk about
[44:23] praise and worship and brother Daniel
[44:26] may take a few services on it and maybe
[44:30] brother Lyall would and that you'd learn
[44:32] a lot more from those two. But it was on
[44:35] my heart to talk about this praise and
[44:38] worship. And tonight we're just going to
[44:39] focus on praise and they are different.
[44:42] Praise and worship are different. Does
[44:44] anyone know how I know that they're
[44:46] different?
[44:48] Because it's a different word.
[44:50] So, there's a word praise and there's a
[44:54] word worship. They're different words.
[44:56] Therefore, they are different things.
[44:58] We're going to talk about praise
[44:59] tonight. And I might accidentally say
[45:02] something that sounds like I'm talking
[45:04] about worship because they do overlap.
[45:07] And before we start, I I just want to
[45:09] share a story, something I learned uh
[45:13] maybe seven or eight years ago about
[45:15] worship. I was laying in bed one Sunday
[45:18] morning
[45:20] And on Sunday morning when you're in
[45:23] bed, you have to get up so you can go to
[45:25] church.
[45:26] And I had decided
[45:29] in 10 seconds of thought that I was too
[45:32] tired to go to church and that I was
[45:35] going to stay home and sleep and maybe
[45:37] I'd go for the evening service or I
[45:40] could stream from home.
[45:42] And then
[45:44] uh I thought and I started to justify
[45:46] myself and say,"Well, I can worship God
[45:48] from here."
[45:50] So I'm I'm just I'm just saying this
[45:52] about worship and then we're going to
[45:53] talk the rest of the night about praise.
[45:55] But I can worship God from right here. I
[45:59] can stay in bed. I don't have to go out
[46:02] and I can worship him from here.
[46:05] And something said, I believe it was the
[46:08] Lord because it's it's stuck with me
[46:09] ever since ever since that day.
[46:13] If you stay in bed,
[46:16] you're worshiping yourself.
[46:20] And I got out of bed.
[46:23] And that action itself is part of
[46:26] worship. When you get up and you say,
[46:29] "I'm going to get in there with my heart
[46:32] set on praising God." just getting out
[46:35] of bed and making the time to go. That
[46:37] is part of your worship right there.
[46:39] That is a that is a key. You might not
[46:41] get anything out of the service.
[46:44] You may leave feeling exactly the same.
[46:47] Notice I said feeling exactly the same
[46:49] because you will be changed even if you
[46:50] didn't feel it, but that is part of your
[46:53] worship. Putting in the effort.
[46:56] Again, we're not talking about worship
[46:58] tonight. I just wanted to share that. Um
[47:00] but we're going to talk about praise. So
[47:02] praise and I'm going to ask the question
[47:04] why
[47:07] praise. You might think, well, is that
[47:10] when we sing songs and clap our hands in
[47:14] church
[47:15] or worship when we raise our hands
[47:18] during the service
[47:20] and uh maybe that one song hits just
[47:23] right and it makes us cry, makes us feel
[47:26] maybe makes us makes us feel sad, maybe
[47:28] makes us feel happy,
[47:31] maybe shout,
[47:33] maybe dance,
[47:35] speak in tongues,
[47:37] maybe get chills. pills down your spine,
[47:41] then what?
[47:44] What's the point of all that?
[47:47] And another question, what are we trying
[47:50] to do when we do that? Are we just
[47:52] trying to get chills? Are we just trying
[47:55] to shout? Are we trying to get some kind
[47:58] of out? And then to take that and make
[48:01] it a little more specific, what is the
[48:02] goal of praise? What is the point?
[48:07] what are we trying to do and what is the
[48:09] goal?
[48:12] So, keep those questions in mind.
[48:16] Now, people often ask, and I've actually
[48:19] seen this question asked to Charlie Kirk
[48:22] on his YouTube page when he was talking
[48:25] about the gospel. Somebody said, "If God
[48:27] is real, then why doesn't he just make
[48:30] us all love him? And why doesn't he just
[48:33] make us all praise him? Why doesn't he
[48:35] just make it so obvious and make us
[48:40] worship him? Why doesn't he do that?
[48:42] That is a commonly asked question. You
[48:44] might get that on the job out in life.
[48:47] If God's real, why doesn't he why
[48:49] doesn't he make us know him?
[48:52] Well, what kind of a relationship would
[48:54] that be if you were forced to do
[48:57] everything? It's a very simple, blunt,
[48:59] straight to the point answer. What kind
[49:01] of relationship would that be if God
[49:03] just made everyone worship him? If he
[49:06] just made everyone love him
[49:09] if you were forced to do it, it wouldn't
[49:11] mean anything.
[49:13] So, I've heard it explained like this
[49:16] about the nature of God, about how he
[49:18] actually loves us. So, imagine there's a
[49:20] guy who likes a girl and he's determined
[49:24] to get this girl to go out with him.
[49:27] And so he asks her if she'll go out with
[49:30] him and she says no or she brushes him
[49:34] off or something.
[49:36] But he's got a lot of courage and he
[49:38] really does like her. So he tries again
[49:40] and again and finally she just says,
[49:43] "Look,
[49:46] you're great,
[49:49] but I only like you as a
[49:53] Oh, it hurts just to say that.
[49:59] Now, what if he said, "Listen,
[50:02] I love you so much that I am going to
[50:06] force you to love me every day of my
[50:09] life and every day of your life, and you
[50:12] don't have a choice. You're going to
[50:13] love me because I love you so much."
[50:18] Call the cops.
[50:22] Run.
[50:24] That is not how God operates.
[50:28] Meanwhile, he does so much for us. And
[50:32] he never asks. He never comes to you and
[50:34] says,
[50:36] "Did you notice how I helped you pay
[50:37] your bills last month?
[50:40] Did you notice how I put food on the
[50:42] table?" He doesn't come seeking
[50:45] attention, seeking praise. He doesn't
[50:48] make you give it to him. And yet, he
[50:50] still blesses us every day. He still
[50:53] gives us all these things. He still
[50:55] makes sure that the bills are paid. The
[50:57] righteous are never forsaken. Their seed
[50:59] are never out begging for bread. The
[51:01] scripture says
[51:04] he's constantly behind the scenes
[51:05] helping us even when we don't notice.
[51:09] Think about this. How wonderful it must
[51:12] make him feel when we say, "Lord, thank
[51:16] you. I could not have made it without
[51:18] you.
[51:20] I could not have done it without the
[51:23] Lord on my side.
[51:25] How wonderful. Take that a step further.
[51:27] It must make him feel when you tell
[51:29] somebody else about it.
[51:31] That the Lord I was in pain and the Lord
[51:33] healed me. I didn't know how I was going
[51:36] to pay my bills and the Lord came
[51:38] through and you tell them that story.
[51:41] I want to take a second because I think
[51:42] this is part of praise because if you
[51:45] think about the word praise, which we'll
[51:47] get to that, but if you think about the
[51:48] word praise, it's not necessarily a
[51:50] spiritual thing. You could say, uh, your
[51:54] boss gave you high praise at work for
[51:56] doing such a good job. Part of praise is
[52:00] testifying about God and all that he's
[52:03] done. So people have a hard time when
[52:06] they go to witness or they go to testify
[52:10] because they don't know what to say.
[52:13] You can say what you are a witness of.
[52:17] You can say what he's done for you. And
[52:19] that's part of giving God praise. And
[52:21] how do you think that makes him feel?
[52:24] How does it make Let me ask you this.
[52:25] How does it make you feel when you're in
[52:27] a group of people and someone says,
[52:30] "Man, Daniel came over and helped me the
[52:33] other week and it was such a blessing."
[52:37] That makes you feel good when somebody
[52:39] acknowledges the good things you did.
[52:40] Now, how about an all- knowing, all
[52:43] powerful, mighty God who does everything
[52:45] for us.
[52:48] I would say he's worthy of some praise,
[52:50] isn't he? He's worthy of being a part of
[52:52] our conversation to talk about the
[52:54] things he's done for us, which he does
[52:56] them every day. His mercies are new
[52:58] every morning.
[53:00] I'm getting ahead of myself,
[53:03] but
[53:05] uh
[53:08] he did command us to do this in the
[53:09] scripture. Go into all the world and
[53:11] share the gospel like I just said. And
[53:14] at the end of saying that, they're all
[53:16] standing there. He says, "Go make
[53:18] disciples. Tell everybody what you saw.
[53:21] Tell everybody what happened. And
[53:23] they're all standing there looking up.
[53:25] And then the angel standing there says,
[53:27] "What are you doing? It's time to go.
[53:30] It's time to take action. It's time to
[53:33] do something about it.
[53:35] I'm not putting you to sleep yet."
[53:39] So even though he wants us to share with
[53:41] others what he does, he never forces us.
[53:45] He never makes us do it.
[53:48] So back to the question,
[53:50] why?
[53:53] Why do we give him praise with our words
[53:55] and our songs?
[53:57] What is the point of praise?
[54:00] Giving praise to God.
[54:03] And what is the goal? Those were our
[54:04] questions. Why do we do it? What's the
[54:06] point? What's the goal?
[54:08] So praise, as I mentioned earlier, it's
[54:10] a verb. And the definition is to express
[54:13] approval or admiration for someone or
[54:16] something. Like I said, it's not
[54:17] necessarily a spiritual thing. You can
[54:20] give someone or something high praise.
[54:23] So, for instance, my mother-in-law is
[54:25] here tonight, and one of my favorite
[54:29] meals that I've ever eaten
[54:32] was chicken salad sandwiches
[54:35] on the beach in Florida.
[54:38] I would say that that is a top five meal
[54:41] of all time that I've ever eaten.
[54:45] And you would say, "That's high praise,
[54:48] Josiah." Coming from someone who eats so
[54:50] much.
[54:52] That's high praise to say, "I didn't I
[54:54] didn't just say that because she's here.
[54:57] It's the most incredible sandwich I've
[54:58] ever eaten." And that's giving praise to
[55:02] something. It's not necessarily
[55:04] spiritual. We've established that. We
[55:06] understand that.
[55:08] Chicken salad sandwiches.
[55:13] So why praise to God?
[55:17] And I think you all know the answer. But
[55:18] let me just
[55:20] humor me. Let me tell you a story.
[55:24] There was a man
[55:26] who was a shepherd who had many sheep
[55:30] and he cared for these sheep and he
[55:32] loved them and he was responsible for
[55:35] them and he watched over them and if
[55:37] something bad would happen it was his
[55:39] job to protect them.
[55:42] But there was a problem in this man's
[55:44] life.
[55:47] That problem was sin.
[55:50] Something had to be done about sin.
[55:55] God has penalties for sin.
[55:58] He requires a life.
[56:02] And this shepherd took
[56:05] the most perfect, clean little lamb he
[56:08] had
[56:09] and killed it
[56:11] as an offering to God.
[56:15] That man's name was Abel.
[56:20] Yes, we know that story.
[56:22] The question is, why do we praise God?
[56:26] Because that's exactly what God did.
[56:31] God took the only perfect lamb
[56:35] and hung it on a cross.
[56:38] Not like Abel making an offering for his
[56:41] sin, God made an offering for our sin
[56:45] and gave his only son on a cross.
[56:49] Let's turn to Philippians 2.
[57:10] Philippians 2. Let's start at the
[57:12] beginning. Let's read the chapter.
[57:15] If there be any consolation in Christ,
[57:18] if any comfort of love, if any
[57:21] fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels
[57:24] of mercies,
[57:26] fulfill ye my joy,
[57:29] that ye be like-minded,
[57:32] having the same love,
[57:35] being of one accord,
[57:37] of one mind.
[57:39] Let nothing be done through strife or
[57:42] vain glory. Amplified says selfishness.
[57:45] It's not about yourself. It's not about
[57:48] myself.
[57:50] But in loneliness of mind, let each
[57:53] esteem other better than themselves.
[57:57] Look not every man on his own things,
[58:00] but every man also on the things of
[58:02] others.
[58:04] And then the famous couple verses here
[58:06] that most of us can quote. Let this mind
[58:09] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[58:13] who being in the form of God thought it
[58:16] not robbery to be equal with God
[58:20] but made himself of no reputation
[58:23] and took upon him the form of a servant
[58:26] and was made in the likeness of men.
[58:29] And being found in fashion as a man, he
[58:33] humbled himself and became obedient like
[58:37] that little lamb that we were just
[58:39] talking about. Became obedient unto
[58:41] death, even the death of the cross.
[58:45] Wherefore
[58:47] God has also highly exalted him and
[58:51] given him a name which is above every
[58:54] name.
[58:56] That at the name of Jesus
[58:59] every knee should bow of things in
[59:03] heaven and things in earth and things
[59:05] under the earth. and that every tongue
[59:09] should confess
[59:11] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[59:15] of God the Father.
[59:18] God did this for us
[59:22] so he would get the glory.
[59:25] It's so easy to think about how great it
[59:29] was that God how how great a sacrifice
[59:32] God made and how wonderful it is that
[59:35] he'd do that for us.
[59:38] to the glory
[59:40] of God the Father.
[59:43] The only reasonable thing to do for a
[59:47] God that has given everything to us and
[59:50] a God that we really can't give much
[59:52] back to. He doesn't need our money.
[59:56] He doesn't need our whatever it is. It
[1:00:00] is reasonable for us to praise him for
[1:00:03] what he's done. That is the answer to
[1:00:06] the why. Because he gave everything
[1:00:10] for us. The least we could do is tell
[1:00:15] him how great he is and show our
[1:00:17] gratitude through praising him.
[1:00:20] And I love that it says
[1:00:23] that every knee should bow.
[1:00:27] I didn't get a chance to go study uh in
[1:00:30] the Greek to see if I have this right.
[1:00:33] Every knee should bow and every tongue
[1:00:36] should confess but they don't.
[1:00:40] Every knee doesn't bow and every tongue
[1:00:42] doesn't confess. There will come a day
[1:00:44] that it will happen when every knee will
[1:00:46] bow and every tongue will confess that
[1:00:48] Jesus is Lord
[1:00:51] and we should be doing it here
[1:00:54] in church and everywhere we go in the
[1:00:57] world.
[1:01:00] So to look back, like I said, let
[1:01:02] nothing be done through strife. That's
[1:01:04] verse three. Through strife or vain
[1:01:06] glory, selfishness. It's not about it's
[1:01:09] not about me. It's not about you. It's
[1:01:11] about the perfect lamb of God who took
[1:01:14] upon my sin when I should have been the
[1:01:17] one paying the paying the penalty for
[1:01:19] it. I should have been the one dying.
[1:01:21] That's why I praise him. That's why he's
[1:01:24] worthy of it.
[1:01:27] In Romans 1, Romans 12:1 just says uh we
[1:01:31] should present our bodies a living
[1:01:32] sacrifice which is our reasonable
[1:01:36] service.
[1:01:37] He gave himself a sacrifice. He gave he
[1:01:40] gave himself to the point of death. And
[1:01:42] this says you can still live. You don't
[1:01:45] have to die. Present your body as a
[1:01:48] living sacrifice to him. So this is
[1:01:51] serious.
[1:01:53] This isn't a light matter.
[1:01:56] God gave everything even his only son
[1:01:59] and that's why we praise him. Now I
[1:02:03] don't think anyone agre disagrees with
[1:02:05] that. I think that's pretty much
[1:02:07] accepted by everyone in our Wednesday
[1:02:09] night crowd.
[1:02:12] But now let's move to the next point. Uh
[1:02:15] I'm not going to spend too much time on
[1:02:17] this. I was going to spend more time I
[1:02:19] think maybe on another night. We'll take
[1:02:21] a whole uh a whole Wednesday night study
[1:02:24] to talk about uh this there's no middle
[1:02:28] ground in praise in praising God and
[1:02:32] worshiping God. There's no middle.
[1:02:33] There's no in between. Uh it's not
[1:02:36] something worthy of Sunday and Wednesday
[1:02:39] only.
[1:02:42] And there's many scriptures we could
[1:02:44] read for that that we won't read
[1:02:45] tonight. But the main point is that
[1:02:46] there's no middle ground in this. This
[1:02:48] isn't something that you stand on the
[1:02:50] sidelines.
[1:02:54] Should I say it?
[1:02:57] This isn't something you stand on the
[1:02:59] sidelines when the song when Daniel
[1:03:02] sings the song you don't like
[1:03:04] because it's not about you. It's not
[1:03:08] about the song.
[1:03:11] It's not about how well we sing it or
[1:03:13] these instruments. It's about a perfect,
[1:03:15] holy, mighty, powerful God. And when
[1:03:18] somebody in a service, think about that,
[1:03:20] when you choose to not worship God
[1:03:22] because you don't like the song.
[1:03:25] Lord, I was going to praise you. I was
[1:03:28] praising you on the last song. I was
[1:03:29] able to praise you on the last song. I
[1:03:32] can't I'm no longer able to praise you
[1:03:34] because they're singing a song I don't
[1:03:36] like.
[1:03:38] Or maybe maybe maybe just a song you
[1:03:41] don't know. But you know if you don't
[1:03:43] know the song, you can still praise him.
[1:03:47] That says make a that scripture we read
[1:03:48] at the beginning says make a joyful
[1:03:50] noise unto the Lord all ye lands. Serve
[1:03:53] the Lord with gladness. Come into his
[1:03:55] presence with singing. Enter his gates
[1:03:58] with thanksgiving. Here's a trick. If
[1:04:01] you don't know the song, close your eyes
[1:04:04] and start to thank the Lord for the
[1:04:06] things he's done.
[1:04:08] Start to tell him how wonderful he is.
[1:04:10] You still got a voice. You still have a
[1:04:13] tongue. You still have breath in your
[1:04:15] lungs. How many times have we sung with
[1:04:19] every breath that I am able,
[1:04:23] but only if they sing the songs I know.
[1:04:29] You still have breath in your lungs when
[1:04:32] you don't know the song. And especially
[1:04:34] when we're coming to church and we have
[1:04:36] a half an hour before brother Daniel
[1:04:39] comes out to preach and we have a h
[1:04:42] about a half hour to get this place in
[1:04:45] an atmosphere where the word can come
[1:04:46] forth. We don't have time to complain
[1:04:50] about the song. We don't have time to
[1:04:53] wish it was a different way. The only
[1:04:56] thing we have time to do is to lift God
[1:04:59] up and praise him so that he would feel
[1:05:00] welcome in our service. so that he can
[1:05:03] move. Isn't that what we all want?
[1:05:06] I don't want to come across as an angry
[1:05:10] worship leader who has who has opinions.
[1:05:14] I really believe we have a purpose in
[1:05:17] that in that 30 minute period before the
[1:05:19] word comes to make this place. Think
[1:05:22] about the new people that are coming in
[1:05:23] off the street. Add some of them here
[1:05:26] Sunday morning.
[1:05:28] What if, God forbid,
[1:05:31] what if I'm the reason that they don't
[1:05:33] feel the presence of the Lord in that
[1:05:35] service because I have a bad attitude?
[1:05:37] I'm not going to make it about anyone
[1:05:39] else. What if it's my fault?
[1:05:42] What if I'm trying to do things my own
[1:05:45] way? I'll say it as a worship leader up
[1:05:48] here. What if I want things to go a
[1:05:49] certain way, be louder, maybe be
[1:05:52] quieter,
[1:05:53] and I make it about something other than
[1:05:56] God?
[1:05:59] What if I'm guilty of that person not
[1:06:02] experiencing the presence of the Lord?
[1:06:04] And what if one of us has to stand there
[1:06:06] one day
[1:06:08] and the Lord plays on that great day,
[1:06:14] all you had to do was give me thanks.
[1:06:17] All you had to do was give me praise.
[1:06:20] Oh, let us not, Lord Jesus, let us not
[1:06:24] be a church.
[1:06:26] That does not make him feel welcome.
[1:06:29] So when someone comes in and they need
[1:06:32] to encounter Jesus Christ, let us not
[1:06:35] get in the way of that. And one way I
[1:06:38] can guarantee will never get in the way
[1:06:41] in the way of that is if we are praising
[1:06:43] God with our whole hearts.
[1:06:47] So, we would all agree that when we come
[1:06:50] to church, we want to feel his presence
[1:06:53] here. Nobody would say that they want to
[1:06:55] come to church and not feel his
[1:06:57] presence. And I don't like to use the
[1:07:00] word feel
[1:07:02] because it really doesn't depend on your
[1:07:05] feeling. You may feel him and you may
[1:07:07] not. And he could be right there and you
[1:07:10] not feel him. And if you don't feel him,
[1:07:13] like I said, that doesn't stop you from
[1:07:15] praising him. just because you don't
[1:07:17] feel him there. So, like I said, I don't
[1:07:19] like there's nothing wrong with wanting
[1:07:20] to feel the presence of the Lord.
[1:07:24] But that's not the most important thing.
[1:07:26] That's all I'm saying by that. So, we
[1:07:29] would all agree we want the presence of
[1:07:31] the Lord in our service. We want him to
[1:07:34] feel welcome. And we do like even though
[1:07:37] it's not the most important thing, we
[1:07:39] want to feel his presence near. That's
[1:07:41] that is a good thing to desire. I'm not
[1:07:43] saying it's not a good thing to want.
[1:07:49] So, how do we get that?
[1:07:52] Giving praise to God.
[1:07:54] Let's turn to Psalms 22.
[1:08:01] I opened up with a psalm because if
[1:08:03] somebody's going to talk about praise,
[1:08:04] you would just if you closed your eyes
[1:08:06] and said, "Pick a book that you're going
[1:08:07] to talk about praise from."
[1:08:10] Most people would say Psalms.
[1:08:14] Psalms 22. Verse three. Let's go right
[1:08:16] to verse three.
[1:08:19] Thou, oh Lord, but thou, excuse me, but
[1:08:23] thou art holy,
[1:08:25] oh thou that inhabitest inhabits the
[1:08:29] praises of Israel.
[1:08:34] So he lives in the praises.
[1:08:37] David is saying, "Lord, you you dwell,
[1:08:41] you inhabit, you live in the praises of
[1:08:44] your people, Israel."
[1:08:46] I think we could say he would live in
[1:08:49] his in the praises of the people at
[1:08:51] Tucson Tabernacle. Also, he lives in the
[1:08:53] praises of his people.
[1:08:56] So, go back to the first verse.
[1:09:01] This is a very very very very famous
[1:09:03] verse because the most famous person
[1:09:05] who's ever lived quoted this.
[1:09:08] My God, my God,
[1:09:11] why hast thou forsaken me?
[1:09:14] Why art thou so far from helping me? And
[1:09:17] from the words of my roaring, Amplified
[1:09:20] says, groaning.
[1:09:23] Now, if Jesus hadn't said this,
[1:09:27] I would almost think that that's the
[1:09:29] wrong attitude.
[1:09:32] So, I learned from reading this, it's
[1:09:35] okay to ask the Lord, why am I going
[1:09:37] through this if it's done in the right
[1:09:39] spirit, if it's done in the right
[1:09:41] attitude, because Jesus asked the very
[1:09:43] question, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[1:09:46] me? And then verse two, oh my God, I cry
[1:09:50] in the daytime, but thou hearest not.
[1:09:54] And in the night season, and I'm not
[1:09:56] silent.
[1:09:58] So these first two verses
[1:10:01] are lamenting. Why have you forsaken me,
[1:10:03] Lord? I cried,
[1:10:06] but thou hearest not.
[1:10:09] So these first two verses are very
[1:10:11] negative it seems and very
[1:10:14] almost selflooking
[1:10:18] and then the third verse if you read
[1:10:20] this it almost seems like David has a
[1:10:25] but thou art holy oh Lord oh thou that
[1:10:29] inhabits the praises of his people. You
[1:10:31] know what's interesting about this
[1:10:32] psalm?
[1:10:34] Read the rest of it when you get home or
[1:10:37] sometime almost the rest of the entire
[1:10:40] thing is just David exalting the Lord.
[1:10:43] It starts off with Lord you didn't hear
[1:10:46] me. I cried and you didn't hear me. And
[1:10:48] then it's like this realization.
[1:10:52] Oh, you inhabit the praises of your
[1:10:56] people.
[1:10:57] That's where you dwell. And he spends
[1:11:00] the rest of the chapter praising the
[1:11:03] Lord and lifting him up and giving him
[1:11:06] glory. He says, we'll read a few verses
[1:11:08] because it's so beautiful. He says, "Our
[1:11:10] fathers trusted in thee. They trusted
[1:11:14] and thou did deliver them."
[1:11:18] Can you say amen?
[1:11:23] They cried unto thee and were delivered.
[1:11:27] They trusted in thee. and were not
[1:11:29] confounded.
[1:11:31] But I am a worm and no man, a reproach
[1:11:36] of men and despised of the people.
[1:11:42] Look at the humility there. Once you
[1:11:45] realize if I want to encounter God,
[1:11:50] he inhabits the praises of his people.
[1:11:54] start to lift him up and just watch him
[1:11:57] come down. Just watch him come on the
[1:12:00] scene.
[1:12:02] And it's it's painted out right here in
[1:12:04] this beautiful psalm. And I encourage
[1:12:05] you to read the whole thing on your own.
[1:12:18] So like I said, I don't want to spend
[1:12:20] too much time tonight. I just wanted to
[1:12:22] lay foundation. We're going to spend
[1:12:25] several Wednesday nights on praise and
[1:12:26] worship.
[1:12:28] And I think we understand even before
[1:12:31] coming here, this isn't something you
[1:12:35] didn't already know. When we praise,
[1:12:37] it's not about us. It's about Jesus.
[1:12:40] It's about what he did for us. Brother
[1:12:43] Daniel said
[1:12:46] that he doesn't need he said, I'm I'm
[1:12:49] going to try to quote him verbatim. He
[1:12:51] said, 'I don't need a church of 500
[1:12:53] people.
[1:12:55] We love to see new converts. We love to
[1:12:57] baptize people. We would like our church
[1:12:59] to grow. He said, "But that's not what
[1:13:01] matters."
[1:13:03] He said, "If I could just have 20 that
[1:13:06] really knew the Lord,
[1:13:09] that would be better than having 600
[1:13:12] people in this building." He said, "If I
[1:13:13] could just have 20 people that really
[1:13:15] had a relationship with Jesus Christ."
[1:13:18] So I would say as a worship leader,
[1:13:23] it would be wonderful if we started off
[1:13:26] the service and people were shouting and
[1:13:29] people were clapping their hands and
[1:13:31] people were rejoicing and people ran and
[1:13:33] people were just free in the service
[1:13:36] that would make me feel so good.
[1:13:39] But if we could just have 20 people for
[1:13:42] 30 minutes who the whole service
[1:13:46] their mind is focused and their heart
[1:13:48] their heart's intent is focused on
[1:13:51] lifting up Jesus Christ. If we could
[1:13:53] just have 20 people that do that maybe
[1:13:56] never open their mouth the whole service
[1:13:59] but have their heart and mind sincerely
[1:14:02] focused on Jesus Christ. That would be
[1:14:04] better than having 500 people that sang
[1:14:07] the song perfectly. 500 people that
[1:14:11] raised their hands or shouted or
[1:14:12] clapped. If there was 20 people in a
[1:14:14] service and that was all that was there
[1:14:16] and they were focused on Jesus Christ,
[1:14:18] can you imagine the service that would
[1:14:19] be?
[1:14:22] So, I would like to leave you with the
[1:14:26] thought of when you come here and you're
[1:14:28] worshiping him, think about some of
[1:14:31] these songs we sing.
[1:14:34] When I saw the cleansing fountain,
[1:14:37] open wide for all my sin,
[1:14:40] I obeyed the spirit's wooing when he
[1:14:43] said, "Wilt thou be clean?"
[1:14:46] The emphasis isn't on me seeing the
[1:14:49] cleansing fountain or the spirit talking
[1:14:52] to me. The emphasis is on him. And the
[1:14:56] and the course says when I saw that open
[1:14:59] wide for all my sin,
[1:15:01] I will praise him.
[1:15:04] I will praise him. I will praise the
[1:15:07] lamb for sinner slain. When you sing,
[1:15:10] when I think
[1:15:12] of God, his son, not sparing,
[1:15:17] sent him to die,
[1:15:19] I scarce can take it in. That on the
[1:15:22] cross, my burden gladly bearing, he bled
[1:15:25] and died to take away my sin. The song
[1:15:29] isn't about my soul. Then sings my soul,
[1:15:33] my savior God, to thee, how great thou
[1:15:36] art.
[1:15:39] Like I said, it doesn't matter the noise
[1:15:42] we make. It matters if our hearts and
[1:15:44] minds are focused on Jesus Christ.
[1:15:47] But how does that not make you feel some
[1:15:49] kind of way when I think that God, his
[1:15:52] son, not sparing, sent him to die for
[1:15:55] me?
[1:15:57] How does that not make you want to shout
[1:15:58] every once in a while and give the Lord
[1:16:01] glory and testify about his goodness and
[1:16:05] say, "Lord, I am an unworthy sinner and
[1:16:08] you are so great." Then sings my soul.
[1:16:11] When that really connects my soul, my
[1:16:14] savior God to thee, how great you are.
[1:16:17] Not how great I am, how great you are
[1:16:21] for what you've done, Lord Jesus. It's
[1:16:24] about him.
[1:16:26] If we could have that same attitude in
[1:16:28] every service,
[1:16:30] think of the people that would come in,
[1:16:32] sinners, lost that would come into this
[1:16:35] service and feel the presence of the
[1:16:37] Lord here.
[1:16:39] Think of what could happen if we focused
[1:16:42] on the Lord and not on ourselves. That's
[1:16:45] what praise is. That's why we do it
[1:16:48] because it's about him
[1:16:53] and that's the goal is to lift him up in
[1:16:55] everything we do. If the musicians want
[1:16:58] to come
[1:17:05] and if you'd stand with me,
[1:17:11] let's have a word of prayer. We're going
[1:17:12] to sing a song.
[1:17:14] And if we could spend three minutes at
[1:17:17] the end of this Wednesday night, maybe
[1:17:20] more, but if we could spend three
[1:17:21] minutes and everyone in here's heart was
[1:17:24] focused on one person, the one who bled
[1:17:26] and died for all of us,
[1:17:29] who hung on that cross so I wouldn't
[1:17:31] have to. If we could focus on him for a
[1:17:34] few minutes.
[1:17:37] Let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[1:17:41] if you'd play, how great thou are. Lord
[1:17:44] Jesus, you are worthy.
[1:17:48] No one in this room is worthy except
[1:17:51] you, Lord, because you live in the
[1:17:54] praises of your people. And we're here
[1:17:57] tonight to give you praise, Lord Jesus.
[1:18:01] Lord, if the words I spoke failed, if
[1:18:03] they didn't make any sense,
[1:18:06] it wouldn't matter if you were lifted up
[1:18:08] in this service. It wouldn't matter if
[1:18:11] we didn't have a piano, if we didn't
[1:18:12] have microphones, if we didn't have new
[1:18:14] carpet. If you were glorified in this
[1:18:17] service, it wouldn't matter, Lord Jesus,
[1:18:20] as long as you get the glory in each one
[1:18:22] of these lives tonight.
[1:18:25] Lord Jesus, help us to glorify, Lord
[1:18:27] Jesus.
[1:18:29] How guilty I am, Lord, of making the
[1:18:32] songs about me, making the service about
[1:18:34] me, Lord,
[1:18:37] when you're the only one worthy, Lord
[1:18:39] Jesus.
[1:18:42] Hallelujah. God be praised.
[1:18:46] God be praised. Hallelujah.
[1:18:49] Let's sing this. Oh Lord my God,
[1:18:56] when I in awome
[1:19:00] wonder
[1:19:04] consider
[1:19:06] all
[1:19:09] the world's thy hands
[1:19:12] have made.
[1:19:14] Just speak to him tonight. Oh, I see the
[1:19:19] stars.
[1:19:23] I hear the rolling
[1:19:27] thunder.
[1:19:28] Blessed be your name. Thy power
[1:19:32] throughout
[1:19:35] the universe
[1:19:39] displayed. Yes, Jesus.
[1:19:43] Oh, then sings my soul.
[1:19:49] Oh Lord, my Savior
[1:19:52] God to thee.
[1:19:56] How great thou art. How great thou are.
[1:20:03] Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:06] How great
[1:20:08] thou are.
[1:20:12] Oh, then sings my soul,
[1:20:18] my Savior
[1:20:21] God
[1:20:22] to thee,
[1:20:25] Lord, you are great. Oh, how great thou
[1:20:30] are.
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:34] How great
[1:20:37] thou art. Verse two, just continue to
[1:20:40] think about him. Oh, when through the
[1:20:44] woods
[1:20:47] and forest glades
[1:20:51] I wander
[1:20:54] and hear the birds
[1:20:59] singing sweetly
[1:21:01] in the your creation. Oh God, you
[1:21:05] created them. And when I look down
[1:21:13] from lofty
[1:21:15] mountain
[1:21:17] grander, yes, Lord. Oh, and hear the
[1:21:22] brook
[1:21:24] and feel the gent. Oh Lord, it makes me
[1:21:29] want to praise you tonight.
[1:21:32] Oh yes. then sings my soul,
[1:21:38] my Savior
[1:21:40] God to thee.
[1:21:46] Oh, how great
[1:21:48] thou art.
[1:21:52] Oh, how great thou are.
[1:21:59] Yes. Then sings my soul,
[1:22:04] my Savior
[1:22:07] God to thee.
[1:22:13] How great thou are.
[1:22:20] How great thou art. Think of this third
[1:22:24] verse now.
[1:22:26] Oh, and when
[1:22:29] I think
[1:22:32] that God, his son not spare. Oh,
[1:22:37] hallelujah. But sent him to die.
[1:22:44] I scarce can take it. This is what it's
[1:22:49] all about. Think about it. Oh, that on
[1:22:52] that cross,
[1:22:54] that cross for me, my burden
[1:22:59] gladly
[1:23:01] bearing.
[1:23:04] He bled
[1:23:06] and died
[1:23:09] to take
[1:23:11] away
[1:23:12] my sin.
[1:23:16] It's then then sings my soul
[1:23:23] my savior
[1:23:25] God to thee.
[1:23:28] How great thou are Lord. How great thou
[1:23:34] are.
[1:23:38] How great thou are.
[1:23:44] Yes. Then sings my soul,
[1:23:49] my Savior
[1:23:52] God to thee.
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:58] How great thou are.
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:04] How great thou are. There's one more
[1:24:09] verse.
[1:24:11] When Christ shall come. Yes.
[1:24:17] With shout ofation
[1:24:22] that's coming. And he'll take me home.
[1:24:29] What joy shall fill my heart.
[1:24:35] Think of this now. Then I shall bow.
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:43] in humble
[1:24:45] adoration
[1:24:49] and there proclaim,
[1:24:54] oh my God, how great thou art.
[1:25:02] Build and sings my soul,
[1:25:08] my Savior
[1:25:10] God to thee.
[1:25:16] Oh, how great thou are.
[1:25:23] How great thou are.
[1:25:29] Well, then sings my soul,
[1:25:35] my Savior
[1:25:37] God to thee.
[1:25:43] How great thou are.
[1:25:50] How great
[1:25:52] thou are.
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:25:59] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:26:01] praise? That is scriptural. That is
[1:26:04] written in the Psalms. Clap your hands
[1:26:06] unto the Lord. He's worthy. He is worthy
[1:26:09] of all praise.
[1:26:11] He's worthy.
[1:26:15] So worthy.
[1:26:20] Oh worthy.
[1:26:23] The lamb
[1:26:25] that was slain.
[1:26:30] Oh yes, he's worthy.
[1:26:33] Lord Jesus, you're worthy. So worthy.
[1:26:40] Oh, worthy.
[1:26:43] The lamb
[1:26:45] that was slain. Sing that again. Worthy.
[1:26:50] Oh, he's worthy.
[1:26:55] Oh worthy.
[1:27:00] Oh worthy
[1:27:03] the lamb
[1:27:05] that was slain.
[1:27:07] Let's sing verse one.
[1:27:10] Hear the cries
[1:27:12] of the shackled
[1:27:15] from the onset
[1:27:18] of time.
[1:27:20] For the chains
[1:27:22] of defeat, there's no key. There was no
[1:27:27] one to save me from my sin. See the
[1:27:30] tears
[1:27:32] of the broken,
[1:27:35] the cries
[1:27:37] of the slain.
[1:27:40] Is there no one
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:43] worthy to set us free?
[1:27:47] But then the crying was still.
[1:27:50] Then the crying
[1:27:52] is still
[1:27:54] as the chorus
[1:27:57] rings out.
[1:27:59] Oh, the shackled
[1:28:02] released from their chains.
[1:28:08] You part of that group. And thousands
[1:28:12] of voices
[1:28:14] are swelling
[1:28:17] the song,
[1:28:19] singing worthy,
[1:28:22] worthy
[1:28:24] the lamb. Sing it tonight. Oh yes, he's
[1:28:30] worthy.
[1:28:34] So worthy.
[1:28:38] Lord, you're worthy.
[1:28:41] The lamb
[1:28:43] that was slain.
[1:28:46] You're worthy, Lord Jesus. Oh, he's
[1:28:49] worthy.
[1:28:54] Worthy,
[1:28:58] so worthy.
[1:29:01] The lamb
[1:29:03] that was slain.
[1:29:05] The last verse.
[1:29:08] Then all the archangels
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:13] and the saints of
[1:29:16] all time
[1:29:18] holding
[1:29:20] their crowns in their hands. I want to
[1:29:25] be in that number. I don't know about
[1:29:26] you. They'll fall down
[1:29:30] before him
[1:29:33] joining
[1:29:35] the song. One more time. Worthy,
[1:29:40] worthy
[1:29:42] the lamb. One more time with all our
[1:29:45] hearts this evening. Sing it. Worthy.
[1:29:59] The lamb
[1:30:00] thou was slain.
[1:30:06] Worthy,
[1:30:11] worthy,
[1:30:16] worthy.
[1:30:18] The lamb
[1:30:20] th
[1:30:27] just three minutes.
[1:30:30] Just three minutes to give him praise.
[1:30:35] And we can give him praise. We can
[1:30:36] shout. We can cry. We can speak in
[1:30:39] tongues. Whatever it is, let's just give
[1:30:43] him praise. So now as before we sing
[1:30:45] this song again, think about what he has
[1:30:48] done for you. Think about how much he
[1:30:51] has blessed you. Think about the
[1:30:52] blessings that are on your life. Think
[1:30:55] about the blessings that God has poured
[1:30:57] out upon you. And now let's sing that
[1:30:59] song again. Worthy is the lamb. Think
[1:31:02] about those things as you give him
[1:31:04] praise and say, "Lord, thank you for
[1:31:07] what you have done. You are worthy of my
[1:31:10] praise." Can you do that? And let's
[1:31:12] praise him one more time.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Hear the cries
[1:31:17] of the shackle
[1:31:20] from the onset
[1:31:22] of time.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; For the chains
[1:31:27] of defeat, there's no key.
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:34] See the tears
[1:31:36] of the broken,
[1:31:39] the cries
[1:31:41] of the slaves.
[1:31:43] Is there no one
[1:31:46] worthy to set us free
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; now? Just praise him with everything
[1:31:51] that's in you.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, worthy.
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; He's worthy.
[1:32:02] Oh Lord, you're worthy.
[1:32:05] The lamb
[1:32:07] that was slain.
[1:32:09] Hallelujah.
[1:32:12] Worthy.
[1:32:17] Worthy.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; The lamb
[1:32:26] that was slain.
[1:32:42] When peace
[1:32:45] like a river
[1:32:49] attendeth
[1:32:53] my way
[1:32:57] And sorrows
[1:33:00] like seas
[1:33:03] builds
[1:33:04] road.
[1:33:10] Whatever
[1:33:13] my life,
[1:33:16] thou has taught
[1:33:19] me to say
[1:33:22] it is well.
[1:33:26] It is well
[1:33:29] with
[1:33:30] my soul.
[1:33:36] It is well.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; With my soul.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; It is well.
[1:33:53] It is well.
[1:33:56] with
[1:33:58] my soul.
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:04] Though Satan
[1:34:07] should buff it, though trials
[1:34:13] should come.
[1:34:16] Let this bless
[1:34:19] assurance
[1:34:22] control
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:27] that Christ
[1:34:29] has regarded
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:33] my helpless
[1:34:37] days
[1:34:38] and hath shed
[1:34:41] his own blood
[1:34:45] for my soul.
[1:34:51] It is well
[1:34:56] with my soul.
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:02] It is well.
[1:35:05] It is well
[1:35:09] with my soul.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. It is well
[1:35:18] with our souls because of the slain
[1:35:21] lamb.
[1:35:23] Because of the one that died on the
[1:35:24] cross for me.
[1:35:27] We worship and we praise.
[1:35:30] I think he's worthy of both.
[1:35:34] And I I think it's a when I hear
[1:35:37] somebody minister,
[1:35:40] I judge a success
[1:35:42] in that when I leave, I want to do what
[1:35:45] that minister was telling me.
[1:35:48] And I think that tonight was a success
[1:35:51] because I'm going to leave here tonight
[1:35:53] and I want to praise him more. I want to
[1:35:56] praise him with my words. I want to
[1:35:59] praise him with my life. I want to
[1:36:01] praise him with everything about me. I
[1:36:03] want to praise the Lord. And as our
[1:36:06] brother said, the way that one of the
[1:36:08] ways that we can praise him is to play
[1:36:10] pay him compliments.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Here is what he did in my life. Amen.
[1:36:15] Brother Joe, if you'd come and close in
[1:36:17] prayer.
[1:36:19] Do you appreciate Brother Josiah?
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] Nice to be in church with you all
[1:36:42] tonight. It's turning out to be just
[1:36:44] real beautiful here and the lovely
[1:36:46] spirit. So, we love you and appreciate
[1:36:47] each one. Let's go to him in prayer.
[1:36:49] Dear God, we're so thankful to be in
[1:36:52] presence, Lord, of wonderful people that
[1:36:55] believe this message. And Lord, how
[1:36:57] great it is to see them, but how much
[1:37:00] greater, Lord, and beyond our
[1:37:02] comprehension to just come in your
[1:37:03] presence, Lord, to praise and worship
[1:37:05] and lift up the name of Jesus on high.
[1:37:08] And we appreciate these times together,
[1:37:10] Lord. There's things in the world that
[1:37:12] are unstable, uncertain, but we know
[1:37:14] this word, this gospel, this message is
[1:37:16] certain. We put all of our hope, our
[1:37:19] faith, our trust in it tonight, Lord,
[1:37:21] and this very desk I believe the prophet
[1:37:24] stood behind. We're very humbled, Lord,
[1:37:25] to be here and to just call upon the
[1:37:28] name of the Lord for grace in our lives.
[1:37:30] Lord, we just plead for your blood, your
[1:37:32] mercy, knowing that things on the
[1:37:34] outside aren't going to get better. We
[1:37:36] know they'll be in decline, but things
[1:37:38] for the church, Lord, will be better
[1:37:39] each day as we praise and worship you,
[1:37:41] lifting up your name. And we just want
[1:37:44] to bring honor to the name of Jesus,
[1:37:46] Lord. We don't always know how to do
[1:37:48] that on the job and in our lives. But we
[1:37:50] know, Brother Brandham preached that
[1:37:52] sermon, Lord. I've listened to it here
[1:37:54] recently, standing for Jesus and being
[1:37:57] your billboard. And
[1:38:00] and we know that the sisters are maybe
[1:38:02] an easier billboard, a more difficult
[1:38:04] walk at times. But may our lives just
[1:38:06] shine the light of Christ. And as we
[1:38:08] praise you, Lord, and give thanks to
[1:38:09] you, may those around us see that,
[1:38:12] recognize that, and see Jesus, Lord, in
[1:38:14] each one. Go with us as we leave this
[1:38:16] place, Lord, and guide our each
[1:38:19] footstep. We know the footsteps of a
[1:38:21] good person, a righteous man or ordered
[1:38:23] of the Lord. Bless the pastor here,
[1:38:25] Brother Dan,
[1:38:27] Josiah, Daniel, Lord, each member. We
[1:38:30] appreciate the Dooall family and the
[1:38:33] Petersons and each one so much and just
[1:38:35] feel very humbled to be with you,
[1:38:37] brother Lyall, and the saints here. just
[1:38:39] to lift up the name of Jesus and all
[1:38:41] that we say and do for that's our desire
[1:38:43] in the wonderful name of our precious
[1:38:45] Lord and Savior the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:47] all God's people say amenise
