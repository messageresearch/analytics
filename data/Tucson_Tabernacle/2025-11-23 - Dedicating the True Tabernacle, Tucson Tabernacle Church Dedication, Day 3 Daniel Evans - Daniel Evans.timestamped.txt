[6:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus is awesome this morning.
[6:51] You may be seated. So before I I play
[6:54] this song, [clears throat] it's called
[6:56] song's called You Were Were you You It's
[6:57] It's You Were Worth It is is the song
[6:59] I'm going to play. Um I'm gonna just
[7:02] share a threeinut uh testimony that I've
[7:05] only shared with a few individuals.
[7:07] [clears throat] Um and I just trust it's
[7:09] going to help you to better understand
[7:10] who you are and just who who we are.
[7:14] So at the beginning of my uh my career,
[7:16] I was I was living in Bangkok, Thailand.
[7:18] And um I'm gonna just make this make
[7:20] this quick. Um, I was in this social
[7:23] gathering and I was talking to a number
[7:24] of people. One of them was this girl
[7:26] from Hong Kong. She was a Catholic. And
[7:28] shortly into the conversation, she asked
[7:30] me if I was a Christian. I said yes. Um,
[7:34] so after after a couple more
[7:35] conversations, um, you know, I I started
[7:38] just telling her what the Lord did for
[7:40] me and I said, "Do you do you want to be
[7:43] baptized? Um, do you want to repent and
[7:45] be baptized?" Um, what I wasn't
[7:47] expecting was for her to say yes at 11
[7:49] o'clock at night. [clears throat] Um
[7:52] because I was like, I don't know where
[7:53] water is. Um so fortunately the the
[7:57] building I worked downtown had a
[7:59] fountain in front of it. So we hopped in
[8:00] a taxi. Um we drove down there. The
[8:03] security guard was was asleep half the
[8:05] time. Then he woke up when he saw us get
[8:06] in the fountain. But uh so I baptized
[8:09] her. We got back in the taxi. It's
[8:11] midnight. We drove back. [clears throat]
[8:13] Um so I was I want to tell you that that
[8:16] was just like the context. But the part
[8:18] I want to tell you about is what I want
[8:19] to hopefully encourage you and just help
[8:21] you with your faith. It helps. And the
[8:23] Lord just showed me this as I was on the
[8:24] on the flight from Tampa here a couple
[8:26] days ago because I I I hadn't remembered
[8:29] this and he never showed that he never I
[8:31] think he kind of explained to me why why
[8:33] um he allowed this part to happen. So I
[8:36] was laying in bed and I don't know if
[8:37] this was a vision but I wasn't I I dream
[8:40] a lot and it wasn't a dream. I think I
[8:42] was awake and I was in my room laying on
[8:45] [clears throat] my bed and um something
[8:49] a dark presence came to the room and
[8:51] started pushing me into my bed. Um and I
[8:54] could not get up um and I I cried um I
[9:00] cried Jesus, Jesus. And this is the
[9:04] first time I've heard an audible voice
[9:06] like there was something else. It wasn't
[9:08] just in my head a thought. There was an
[9:09] audible voice from the darkest place. It
[9:13] was from hell. And it said, "The people
[9:16] of the Lord." The people of the Lord.
[9:20] And then another voice came and said,
[9:23] "Get out of the room. Get out of the
[9:25] room." And it left. So I want to tell
[9:29] you that because Satan knows who you
[9:31] are.
[9:33] Okay? So you are the people of the Lord.
[9:36] God knows who you are. Do you know who
[9:38] you are?
[9:39] Okay. So, I'm gonna just give you the
[9:42] background for this song. Last uh last
[9:45] weekend before I knew I was going to be
[9:46] coming here, I sat down 10:30 at the
[9:49] piano and this song just just happened.
[9:52] And it happened as a result of just
[9:54] feeling very burdened for um a neighbor
[9:57] that we're close to. We did carpool with
[10:00] them and she's tried to commit suicide
[10:02] this year. Um just going through a
[10:04] really hard time. And I just wrote this
[10:06] song called You Were Worth It because
[10:10] you were so you were so worth it. And
[10:12] even when you think back um the very
[10:15] beginning of the Bible, it says in the
[10:16] beginning God created. He did that for
[10:18] you.
[10:20] And he did all the math, all the
[10:22] physics, all the biology. He did all of
[10:25] that. So you know that you're worth it.
[10:28] And he did that even for for people that
[10:30] don't accept him. and and he so so you
[10:33] you are worth it no matter what.
[10:37] And I just I just wanted to remind you
[10:38] of that and just give you the context.
[10:43] [clears throat]
[11:09] I have a story about somebody. You know,
[11:14] [singing]
[11:15] sometimes they feel like they are a
[11:19] nobody.
[11:23] But that's not what God said about you.
[11:31] Before there was time,
[11:33] he was all alone in his mind,
[11:37] not thinking about the earth and the
[11:40] stars.
[11:45] He was thinking of you.
[11:51] No matter how you are,
[11:54] he knows it.
[11:58] Whatever the price, he paid it.
[12:06] No matter how lost, you're worth it.
[12:11] You're worth it all.
[12:14] [music]
[12:18] You're worth it all. Oh,
[12:26] you [music] might think
[12:28] when you're looking in that sunrise,
[12:32] you're all alone
[12:35] there in the sunlight.
[12:40] But he made that horizon for you.
[12:44] [music]
[12:46] As the world's turning, we're lost in
[12:49] its meaning.
[12:51] Life has a way of only defeating our
[12:55] spirits all
[12:57] longing for something to guide [music]
[13:00] the way.
[13:06] No matter how you are,
[13:08] he knows it.
[13:11] Trust me,
[13:13] [music] whatever the price, he paid it.
[13:20] No matter how lost, you're worth it.
[13:26] You're worth it all.
[13:30] [music]
[13:33] You're worth it all.
[13:36] [music]
[13:38] Before
[13:41] you say goodbye,
[13:44] let [music] him look into your eyes and
[13:48] let him [singing] tell you that you are
[13:52] beautiful
[13:54] but [music] wasn't for your sin.
[13:57] Why on earth would he begin
[14:00] to [music] tell you all the reasons
[14:04] you [singing]
[14:05] are worth
[14:09] it all?
[14:13] Worth
[14:15] it all.
[14:21] No matter how you are,
[14:23] he knows it.
[14:28] Whatever the price,
[14:31] he paid it.
[14:35] No matter how lost, you're worth it all.
[14:41] Worth it all.
[14:48] Worth it all.
[14:54] You're worth it all. [music]
[15:13] Amen. Thank you, brother Stephen. Um, if
[15:15] the brothers want to make ready for the
[15:17] prayer requests and offerings, if we
[15:19] could stand and we're going to sing,
[15:20] "How great is our God.
[15:27] How great
[15:29] is our [singing] God."
[15:32] Oh, sing with me. How [singing] great
[15:37] is our God?
[15:40] And all will [singing] see how great
[15:45] how great
[15:48] is our God.
[15:59] You believe that you were worth it all?
[16:02] you would look at yourself and say not
[16:04] worthy.
[16:07] But he that day when he had to make that
[16:11] decision, he had [music]
[16:12] taken his disciples with him
[16:15] and he said, "We're going to pray cuz
[16:18] I'm about to go through something."
[16:21] And he and he came in a body of flesh so
[16:23] that he could be touched by the filling
[16:25] of your infirmities
[16:27] so he could understand.
[16:30] And he said, "Father, is there another
[16:32] way we could do this.
[16:35] But he said, "No, not my will, but your
[16:37] will be done." Cuz he saw you and he
[16:40] said, "I've got to get to that one.
[16:43] You're worthy of it all. No question
[16:46] about it. I didn't make myself worthy."
[16:49] He took care of it all. Amen. You can
[16:53] say, "Thank you, Lord. I appreciate
[16:55] that, God. There's nothing too wrong,
[16:59] too bad that you can't
[17:01] He will. Thief on the cross. He turned
[17:06] around and said, "Remember me when you
[17:08] come into your kingdom." And he [music]
[17:10] said, "This day you'll be in paradise."
[17:14] Somebody might have asked him, "How did
[17:15] you get here?" And he just [music] said,
[17:17] "He said I could come."
[17:19] &gt;&gt; And if he said you can come, you're
[17:21] welcome.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; As he took paid for it all. Amen.
[17:27] Sister Rebecca Zbrunner
[17:29] requests here.
[17:31] Prayer healing for healing for my aunt
[17:34] Rosanna who has had a few operations on
[17:37] her intestines. [music]
[17:40] So again, he was wounded.
[17:43] He was bruised. So I would be covered.
[17:47] Pray for guidance for a not Lisa
[17:51] who has to find a new place to live in 3
[17:53] weeks. Nothing impossible for him. If
[17:57] Lord, I have a need.
[17:59] And you know what that is. So I'll let
[18:02] you answer it, Lord, the way it should
[18:04] be answered. Lord, we
[18:07] It's hard for us to imagine that
[18:10] you would come down in flesh so that you
[18:12] could be touched by the filling of our
[18:15] infirmities.
[18:17] You even [music] question
[18:20] when that day came to surrender yourself
[18:23] to what was going to be
[18:26] some really hard days ahead of you.
[18:29] But you said not my will but thy will be
[18:32] done Lord. We have the same attitude. We
[18:36] have questions. We have desires. We have
[18:38] wants. But we want it to be directed and
[18:40] led by you, Lord. Because the end result
[18:43] will be what you've desired, Lord. You
[18:46] saw every hand raised. You see every
[18:48] every heart represented here. those that
[18:51] might be listening to in today, Lord,
[18:55] that they realize that if they were the
[18:58] only ones, you still would have given
[18:59] your life to redeem them, Lord. So, we
[19:02] just want to say thank you and we
[19:04] appreciate
[19:05] as they take up the offering, Lord. May
[19:07] we give with a cheerful heart, Lord, and
[19:10] then you bless it for its intended
[19:12] [music] use. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[19:14] name. Amen.

[33:36] cares. This [music] is your house.
[33:41] This is [singing] your house.
[33:45] Come and dwell.
[33:52] We [singing]
[33:53] are standing
[33:57] here [music]
[33:59] on holy
[34:02] ground
[34:07] and [singing] I know that there
[34:12] are angels [singing]
[34:16] all around.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Let us praise
[34:29] Jesus.
[34:31] Now
[34:36] &gt;&gt; we [singing]
[34:37] are [music]
[34:38] standing
[34:40] in his presence [music]
[34:43] on holy [singing] ground.
[34:51] We [singing] are standing

[34:56] his presence [singing]
[34:58] on holy
[35:00] ground.
[35:05] [applause]
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could stand as dad comes.
[35:22] You are my strength when [singing] I am
[35:26] weak. You are [music] the treasure that
[35:30] I seek. You are my [singing] all in all.
[35:39] [music] Seeking you [singing] as a
[35:42] precious jewel, Lord, to give up. I'd be
[35:47] [music and singing] a fool. You are my
[35:50] all in [music and singing]
[35:52] all.
[35:54] Jesus,
[35:56] Jesus,
[35:58] [singing]
[36:00] lamb of God.

[36:31] cross, my shame. Rising again. I bless
[36:36] your name. You are my all [singing] in
[36:40] [music] all.
[36:45] Oh, when I fall down, you pick me up.
[36:49] When I am dry, you fill my cup. You are
[36:53] my all in. [singing]
[36:55] [music] All sing Jesus.
[36:58] Oh Jesus, [singing]
[37:01] [music]
[37:04] lamb of God,

[37:26] your name.
[37:30] Jesus,
[37:32] [music]
[37:33] [singing]
[37:35] lamb of God,
[37:39] worthy [singing]
[37:41] is [music]
[37:42] your name.
[37:47] Jesus,
[37:48] [music]
[37:51] lamb of [singing] God,
[37:55] worthy
[37:57] is your name, [music]
[38:02] Lord God. You are worthy.
[38:05] We're grateful, [music] Lord, that you
[38:07] brought us together in this Sunday
[38:08] morning.
[38:10] Father,
[38:12] I'm excited
[38:15] maybe to see what you're going to do
[38:16] this morning.
[38:18] Lord, you've done so many things, great
[38:20] things.
[38:22] Now, Lord, we ask maybe that you would
[38:26] make yourself known in our midst this
[38:28] morning. That you would be here with us,
[38:31] Father.
[38:32] And Lord that every person that come has
[38:35] come into this building this morning
[38:38] father may they leave
[38:41] Lord
[38:43] receiving what they are expecting.
[38:46] May they receive father what they
[38:47] [music] have asked for. We pray
[38:50] what is written in your word. Lord you
[38:53] ask not because you receive not or you
[38:55] receive not because you ask not. And
[38:58] Lord, we are asking Lord that you would
[39:02] give us, Father, what's on our heart. In
[39:04] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[39:08] bless you, brothers and sisters. You can
[39:09] be seated.
[39:16] I think it's been a good two days. What
[39:19] do you think?
[39:21] [applause]
[39:25] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Now we come to the close of our church
[39:31] dedication. Uh first I want to thank all
[39:35] of the people that have worked so hard,
[39:37] especially the sisters that are in the
[39:39] kitchen that have been doing everything.
[39:42] [applause]
[39:46] [applause]
[39:47] It's been good food.
[39:50] Real good. And that stuff comes it does
[39:54] it comes at a price and they have
[39:56] definitely paid the price. They have
[39:59] worked hard and and it's for us. It's
[40:02] just it's they've working for us because
[40:05] they love us. So I really really
[40:07] appreciate what they've done. Uh the
[40:10] first thing I want to talk about is some
[40:12] directions that I want the church to go
[40:14] that I'm really excited about. The um
[40:17] the first thing is it's a it's a bit of
[40:19] a testimony. It's not just a bit of one.
[40:21] It's a very great testimony. Daniel and
[40:25] I were working on a project and we were
[40:29] trying, what we wanted to do is we
[40:30] wanted to put together a video for the
[40:32] church that we could just put it on our
[40:34] YouTube page that you could share with
[40:36] your friends and if somebody wants to be
[40:39] introduced to what we stand for at the
[40:40] church, just something really short that
[40:42] you could send them a le link or
[40:44] something like that. And so we tried and
[40:47] we interviewed some of you and and we
[40:50] did our best, but we're not pros. And it
[40:53] just wasn't coming together. And I was
[40:55] sitting in my den and I was actually at
[40:58] that moment I was going over
[41:01] this script that just wasn't working.
[41:05] And I get a text
[41:08] from my cousin who I don't talk to very
[41:11] often.
[41:13] and
[41:15] it popped up and it said, "Hi, Daniel
[41:17] and Stephanie.
[41:19] I want to I had it on my heart. I want
[41:21] to gift you and your church a video
[41:27] that you can use to send people." And
[41:30] she says, "I want to pay for it and I
[41:32] want this professional videographer that
[41:35] I know to do it." And he's like us. He's
[41:38] a Christian. He's a believer.
[41:41] And when I saw that text, I was like,
[41:44] "No way. I know that we are in the
[41:47] Lord's will in doing this." My cousin
[41:50] Hope is and her husband Craig, dear,
[41:53] just dear wonderful people. Hope and I
[41:56] grew up together. We're the same age.
[41:58] She's like 10 years younger than me.
[42:03] Hope and Craig, stand up in the back.
[42:06] Yeah, you got to stand up. [applause]
[42:16] I love I love that girl. We've been we
[42:20] were very very close growing up. And I
[42:23] hope Thank you so much. If we could play
[42:25] the video
[42:27] in John chapter 17, Jesus prays that the
[42:31] disciples would be in such unity that
[42:33] the world would see their unity and know
[42:35] that God sent Jesus Christ to the world.
[42:38] Jesus is asking the father for a church
[42:40] that would produce such love that
[42:42] sinners would come to salvation not
[42:44] through their doctrine necessarily and
[42:47] not necessarily through their music but
[42:49] through the love that they have for each
[42:51] other.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Spirit of the church is loving, caring.
[42:59] When I came here, the first smile I saw
[43:01] was actually sister Heathers and she
[43:04] welcomed me with a huge hug and I felt
[43:08] welcomed and not judge or anything.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; I would say uh loving for sure and
[43:14] accepting and we don't care what anyone
[43:16] looks like or what your background is,
[43:18] but we just want souls to be saved and
[43:21] them to come to the Lord and have a
[43:23] better life through him.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; My favorite thing about Tucson
[43:26] Tabernacle is the pastor. He has a lot
[43:30] of compassion and love for us. The
[43:32] second is the congregation and you know
[43:34] all the brothers and sisters get
[43:36] together and it's [music] all love. They
[43:37] don't discriminate.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; I think Tucson Tabernacle is a great
[43:42] place u for someone who is scared of
[43:45] meeting new people. We understand those
[43:47] struggles and those fears and I feel
[43:49] like you always have someone there to
[43:50] shake your hand or greet you and that
[43:53] helps so much to take that nervousness
[43:55] away.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; I value our pastor. He's very special.
[43:59] has a lot of depth and loves the people.
[44:04] That's for sure. And I value that very
[44:06] much.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Gone to church all my life since I was
[44:09] born. But coming to Tucson Tabernacle
[44:14] uh changed my outlook as a Christian
[44:17] that a Christianity was not a set of
[44:19] deeds but was a life lived. I found that
[44:22] at the tabernacle that was the emphasis
[44:25] to live a life worthy of the gospel in
[44:28] the sense that others could see Christ
[44:29] in you.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; It's amazing whenever you you hear the
[44:34] congregation singing and you know you're
[44:37] all just singing to the one creator.
[44:39] You're just singing to Jesus Christ and
[44:42] it's 150 whether it's 150 on Sunday
[44:45] morning or 50 people on Wednesday night.
[44:48] It's you get there and the spirit comes
[44:51] down because All of us are singing to
[44:53] one person. It's and that's the Jesus
[44:55] Christ. It's not about me. It's and it's
[44:58] not about the congregation. It's just
[44:59] about Jesus. The Tucson Tabernacle is a
[45:02] place of refuge where you can come in.
[45:04] You can feel accepted. [snorts] You can
[45:06] worship with great music, hear a
[45:08] Bible-based sermon, but it is also a
[45:11] place of ministry. You may be dealing
[45:13] with your own sins, but don't forget the
[45:15] guy next to you. He's dealing with
[45:16] something, too. come into this church to
[45:19] serve. Not to serve yourself, but to
[45:22] serve others. I promise you'll get what
[45:24] you need, but make it the focus. Make it
[45:26] your focus to serve others. That's the
[45:29] spirit of Christ. And that is the Holy
[45:30] Spirit. That's what I want to see in a
[45:33] church. That's what I want to see in the
[45:35] Tucson Tabernacle. And I really think
[45:37] that we are moving in the right
[45:39] direction.
[45:42] [applause]
[45:47] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Thanks, Hope and Craig. God bless you
[45:52] both. And uh we'll get to this link.
[45:54] Just a a simple introduction to our
[45:57] church. And uh I pray that the Lord will
[46:00] use it. Another thing that I want to do,
[46:03] another direction that we have with this
[46:06] congregation
[46:07] is
[46:09] with our children, especially our little
[46:11] ones.
[46:13] It's important to give the kids what
[46:17] they need and give it to them early.
[46:19] Build that foundation in the young ones.
[46:22] So, I talked with Brother Jordan, Sister
[46:24] Martha, and I actually the other
[46:26] Wednesday or Sunday night, I believe it
[46:28] was, I brought all the kids up in the
[46:30] front, and Brother Jordan led them in a
[46:33] song, and it was just it was really
[46:34] cool. These these kids laughing and
[46:37] singing out loud. And what I want to do
[46:41] is once a month I want to have
[46:44] children's church and we'll do it on a
[46:46] Sunday night and the kids are going to
[46:49] sing. We'll have sing alongs. We'll have
[46:52] Bible readings. We'll have stories. It's
[46:55] going to be focusing on them. And
[46:57] hopefully they'll start singing
[46:59] specials. Hopefully they'll they'll
[47:02] start reading scriptures. And we might
[47:04] even find a couple of these little guys
[47:06] might even be the future preachers,
[47:08] maybe even the future pastor of this
[47:10] church. [applause]
[47:15] [applause]
[47:16] So, we'll put that on the calendar. And
[47:18] I think I I just have really high
[47:20] expectations for Children's Church. I
[47:23] think it's going to be something that
[47:25] these kids will always remember their
[47:27] whole lives.
[47:29] And then the last thing and this is very
[47:32] very important also I have uh a brother
[47:36] that I know
[47:37] he's in South Africa he's watching I'm
[47:40] sure right now his name is Steven Young.
[47:43] Stephen Young is
[47:47] a man of God.
[47:49] A real deal man of God. He loves the
[47:54] word with all of his heart and he has a
[47:56] calling in his life to be a pastor. He's
[47:59] pastored for many years
[48:02] and
[48:04] he has suffered.
[48:06] And one thing I I look at my life and
[48:10] most of my suffering has been because of
[48:12] my own doing.
[48:14] Almost all of it as I look back.
[48:18] Stephen lately has suffered because he
[48:21] has stood for the word of God.
[48:24] And he is, as I said, he's he's one of
[48:27] the best preachers I've ever heard. And
[48:31] now he's starting a grassroots effort to
[48:35] build a church in Durban, South Africa
[48:38] in his home. He's got a congregation of
[48:43] very few people right now. He's just
[48:44] he's been on the field doing this for
[48:47] about a month now, I guess. And he has
[48:51] about 12 in his congregation, which that
[48:56] number should sound familiar. That's how
[48:57] many people the Ephesian church started
[49:00] with. One of the greatest churches in
[49:02] the entire Bible.
[49:04] Stephen
[49:06] is
[49:08] he's just got a heart. He's got a heart
[49:10] for the people. He's got a heart for
[49:11] evangelism.
[49:13] And
[49:15] I wanted and I talked with the trustees
[49:18] and we all voted unanimously on doing
[49:20] this. I want to take one offering a
[49:23] month from our church and give it to
[49:28] Stephen to get him going. This isn't a
[49:30] forever thing. We're going to continue
[49:32] this as long as as he's progressing and
[49:35] as as long as he feels called to
[49:37] continue on doing this and until this
[49:40] church gets established. We now the
[49:42] Tucson Tabernacle has a specific
[49:46] overseas missionary program and that is
[49:49] investing in this church in Durban,
[49:51] South Africa. And let me tell you
[49:53] something, I don't think that we could
[49:55] invest in a better group of people than
[49:58] Stephen Young and this little group
[50:00] that's forming there in Durban. of
[50:03] Jordan.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Dear brother Dan and the believers at
[50:09] Tucson Tabernacle, we want to thank you
[50:11] from the bottom of our hearts for your
[50:14] prayers and for your supports for us
[50:16] during our the difficult times that
[50:18] we've been facing here. But we thank God
[50:19] for your love and for your support over
[50:21] there. So from all of us here in Durban,
[50:23] South Africa,
[50:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's
[50:33] [applause]
[50:38] we have an opportunity
[50:41] friends to give. We have an opportunity
[50:44] to support something that could be
[50:47] great. One soul is worth 10,000 worlds.
[50:51] But I look forward to seeing this work
[50:53] that we're doing in South Africa as
[50:56] being a great work. And it's neat
[50:57] because we get to see it from the very
[50:59] foundation of how this is this is going
[51:02] to go. This is these are not tithing.
[51:05] These are offerings. These are something
[51:06] that we can do on top of our um tithing
[51:10] to the church. This is a way that we are
[51:13] able to be generous for someone else.
[51:15] So, one offering a month we are going to
[51:19] send overseas to brother Stephen and the
[51:23] group that you saw there to hopefully
[51:25] get them a place to worship and continue
[51:28] on with brother Steven's outreach. And
[51:30] we're going to start with the offering
[51:31] that we took today. So, this money the
[51:34] trustees will are prepared this money
[51:36] will go to brother Stephen and as I said
[51:39] once a month. So that's the direction
[51:43] some of the exciting new things we have
[51:45] here at Tucson Tabernacle. Brother
[51:47] Steven will also give us um regular
[51:50] reports from the church.
[51:55] I look at these things. I look at our
[51:57] video. I look at the children's church
[52:00] that we're doing
[52:03] overseas missionary efforts.
[52:07] And I don't ever want us to lose
[52:10] perspective.
[52:11] We have to think, is it really going to
[52:14] do any good?
[52:17] Are these things all the the work that
[52:19] we've done
[52:21] really has it done any good?
[52:25] And I think behind the right souls and
[52:28] behind the right attitude and behind
[52:30] prayers, I think it can do good. But we
[52:33] can't lose perspective. all all of the
[52:35] renovations that we've done here at the
[52:37] church and all of the the stuff that
[52:40] we've done outside
[52:43] this church, it's just going to get old
[52:46] again. The carpet's going to wear out
[52:48] that we're going to have to repaint the
[52:49] walls again. We're going to have to redo
[52:52] things in the fellowship hall. There's
[52:54] going to be constant maintenance on it.
[52:56] It's not when when we're investing in
[52:58] this, it's it's a perishable thing. This
[53:02] church isn't going to be here forever.
[53:04] This building, this church will one day
[53:06] be be reduced to rubble. One day it
[53:10] will. But the souls that this church
[53:14] touches,
[53:16] &gt;&gt; those are eternal,
[53:18] &gt;&gt; that is the work that we focus on.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And and the of putting out a video, it's
[53:24] good. And but it's that's not the focus.
[53:26] And and the children's church and having
[53:28] fun, that's not the focus. through
[53:30] renovations. That's not the focus. What
[53:32] is the focus? Is are we touching people
[53:35] and is it having an effect?
[53:37] &gt;&gt; That's the main thing.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Is anything working?
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; We have to ask ourselves that in our own
[53:46] lives.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; We all are familiar with the scripture
[53:49] Malachi 4:5.
[53:52] My question
[53:54] is, have any hearts really changed? Has
[53:58] anything really happened? Let me read
[54:00] the amplified version version of Malachi
[54:03] 4:5. Behold, I'm going to send you
[54:05] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[54:07] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[54:09] And he will turn the hearts of the
[54:10] fathers to their ch to the ch to their
[54:12] children and the hearts of the children
[54:14] to their fathers. Reconciliation
[54:16] produced by repentance. So that I will
[54:19] not come and strike the land with a
[54:21] curse of complete destruction.
[54:25] Reconciliation
[54:27] is what the amplified adds there. A
[54:29] reconciliation
[54:32] produced by repentance.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm asking the question, did it
[54:37] happen?
[54:39] Has that happened? Has it happened in
[54:42] our lives? I'm asking you personally,
[54:46] has it happened in your life? Has this
[54:48] produced something, a change in your
[54:52] heart? Has your heart turned back to the
[54:56] apostles and the prophets?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Has it done anything?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; We're going to celebrate Christmas
[55:02] coming up. You know that we'll have the
[55:05] some people have the tree and the star
[55:06] and the and the presents underneath and
[55:08] all of this, but do we lose the real
[55:11] meaning behind Christmas [snorts]
[55:14] &gt;&gt; with all of the packaging?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Do we lose the meaning behind it?
[55:20] Are the gifts, do they represent what
[55:23] the wise men brought to Jesus? Does the
[55:25] star on the tree, does that represent
[55:27] the star of Bethlehem?
[55:29] Does it represent the birth of Christ?
[55:31] Or do we lose it all and we just say
[55:33] Christmas? Oh, it's a Christian holiday.
[55:36] But have we lost the meaning of it just
[55:38] with the packaging?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; How about Thanksgiving? It's coming up
[55:41] this week.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Do we understand what it's about?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Do we understand the importance of
[55:48] Thanksgiving? how people gave their
[55:50] lives
[55:52] so that we might have freedom here in
[55:54] the United States so that we could have
[55:57] freedom of worship so that we could have
[55:59] prosperity in this new land. Do we
[56:02] understand as we're putting the turkey
[56:04] out and the stuffing and everything
[56:05] else? Do we understand the meaning
[56:07] behind it or have we lost it just in the
[56:09] packaging of Thanksgiving?
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Do we understand
[56:14] what all of these things are about? And
[56:17] how about this church? The Tucson
[56:19] Tabernacle was originally founded really
[56:22] on the promise of turning the heart of
[56:25] the children back to that of the
[56:28] fathers.
[56:30] My question is
[56:34] a reconciliation produced by repentance.
[56:36] Has it happened?
[56:39] Have hearts truly been changed?
[56:43] Has it produced a group of people who
[56:46] have such an outward love
[56:52] for Jesus Christ and for each other? Not
[56:55] with their outward works, but has it
[56:57] produced a love that people have as
[57:00] Jesus prayed that you would I would know
[57:02] you for your love one another. Has it
[57:04] produced that?
[57:07] really ask yourself
[57:11] &gt;&gt; or is it just the same old thing just
[57:15] wrapped in a different package?
[57:18] something we need to ask. And for this
[57:21] generation, this new generation that's
[57:22] coming up
[57:27] that when we as we're dedicating
[57:29] ourselves in this church,
[57:32] is this going to be another generation
[57:34] that just has the same packaging on the
[57:37] outside? Or is this generation going to
[57:39] be truly the ones that their hearts are
[57:42] turned back to what the book of Acts
[57:44] taught
[57:45] &gt;&gt; and what Jesus Christ taught?
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Is it truly going to be that way?
[57:52] Is it truly going to be our hearts are
[57:55] turned back to that of Peter and of
[57:58] James and of John where they had such
[58:01] love one for another that everything was
[58:03] in common. If anybody had any need, they
[58:05] they were helped. They weren't they
[58:08] weren't they weren't hating each other
[58:09] and gossiping about each other. They
[58:12] were supporting each other. Our our
[58:14] lives, our spirits, are they going to be
[58:17] turned back to that?
[58:19] Really?
[58:21] I don't see it yet.
[58:26] What's a tabernacle? We call ourselves
[58:28] the tabernacle. What is a tabernacle?
[58:31] It's just a tent.
[58:33] It's just a a dwelling place is what it
[58:36] is. Moses, when he brought the
[58:38] Israelites out of Egypt, God instructed
[58:42] him to build a portable place of
[58:44] worship, a tabernacle, a tent.
[58:48] It wasn't the biggest tent in the world.
[58:51] It wasn't even probably the nicest tent
[58:54] in the world, but it was built according
[58:57] to God's instructions.
[59:00] And when they finished it exactly how
[59:03] how God had laid it out and they built
[59:06] it exactly. He he gave the specific
[59:08] instructions to the prophet of Mo
[59:10] prophet Moses on how to build it. And
[59:12] when they built it, you know what it
[59:14] was? It was just a tent.
[59:17] It was not special. It was a tent.
[59:21] It was a shelter.
[59:23] But then when the spirit of God
[59:26] came down and dwelt in that tabernacle,
[59:31] then it became something very, very
[59:33] special. Otherwise,
[59:36] it was nothing. Exodus 40
[59:40] verse 34, look what happens when the
[59:43] spirit of God comes down on this tent.
[59:46] Exodus 40 verse 34.
[59:50] Then a cloud covered the tent of the
[59:53] congregation,
[59:55] and the glory of the Lord filled the
[59:59] tabernacle.
[1:00:01] And Moses was not able to enter into the
[1:00:04] tent of the congregation because the
[1:00:06] cloud abode therein, and the glory of
[1:00:08] the Lord filled the tabernacle. Even the
[1:00:10] prophet Moses couldn't even come in
[1:00:12] there. And it because of this spirit of
[1:00:15] God that was so great in this tent.
[1:00:21] And when the cloud was taken up from
[1:00:22] over the tabernacle, the children of
[1:00:24] Israel went onward on in all their
[1:00:26] journeys. But if the cloud were not
[1:00:28] taken up, then the journey then they
[1:00:30] journey not till the day that it was
[1:00:33] taken up. For the cloud of the Lord was
[1:00:36] upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was
[1:00:40] on it by night in the sight of all the
[1:00:43] house of Israel throughout all of their
[1:00:45] journeys. We call this the Tucson
[1:00:48] Tabernacle.
[1:00:49] Why
[1:00:52] is it just the name
[1:00:55] that we just we just call ourselves or
[1:00:57] do we really know what the tabernacle in
[1:01:00] the wilderness represented?
[1:01:02] It represented the Holy Spirit coming
[1:01:04] down in a place of dwelling and abiding
[1:01:08] there and the pillar of fire by night.
[1:01:10] If this thing moved, they packed up the
[1:01:12] tent and they followed it wherever it
[1:01:15] went. They weren't f the tent was
[1:01:17] following the Holy Spirit and not the
[1:01:19] other way around.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; We heard testimonies on Friday night.
[1:01:25] Paul
[1:01:26] with a vision
[1:01:29] and a and a prophetic utterance from
[1:01:31] someone else. And it came to pass.
[1:01:34] Esther delivered of alcoholism. Manny
[1:01:36] delivered of drug abuse and immoral
[1:01:38] living. James and John asking God for a
[1:01:41] place to fellowship.
[1:01:43] Cleano delivered from a demon that was
[1:01:46] tormenting him.
[1:01:49] Friends, these aren't stories from
[1:01:50] another generation.
[1:01:53] This isn't us telling our kids about how
[1:01:54] the pillar of fire followed the
[1:01:56] tabernacle in the wilderness. This is
[1:01:58] real. This is modern day.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; We're not telling ourselves. We're not
[1:02:04] telling testimonies about about
[1:02:06] something else that none of us ever saw.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; These testimonies that we heard, they
[1:02:12] produced something. They produced a
[1:02:14] change of heart.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; That was the main thing.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; The Lord does miracles. Yes. But it's
[1:02:21] that that heart that changed. Turn that
[1:02:24] heart of the CHILDREN BACK TO something
[1:02:27] that is great.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Don't forget the meaning of the whole
[1:02:31] scripture.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Is to make a change in our lives. We
[1:02:36] forget that part.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven Bryant here, he sang the
[1:02:40] song earlier
[1:02:44] and and gave the testimony. He wrote me
[1:02:46] this this morning.
[1:02:48] I hope it's okay because I'm going to
[1:02:50] read it anyway. Stephen,
[1:02:53] I have nice permission.
[1:02:56] I realize he he said this. I realized
[1:02:58] that last night he was talking about our
[1:03:00] service last night.
[1:03:03] Stephen says this. I realized that last
[1:03:05] night I was back in the same pews I was
[1:03:07] as an infant and a child.
[1:03:10] And now I'm standing here as a grown
[1:03:11] man.
[1:03:13] And somehow God loved me enough to chase
[1:03:15] me down all those roads and made me into
[1:03:18] something I never thought I wanted to
[1:03:20] be.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; But there I was praying under such an
[1:03:25] anointing
[1:03:27] under such anointing for him to take
[1:03:31] 100% control. Then something new
[1:03:34] happened.
[1:03:36] It was faith to believe that he could
[1:03:39] take 100%.
[1:03:42] How many How many here really want him
[1:03:44] to take a 100%.
[1:03:46] That's a hard That's a hard That's a
[1:03:49] hard one to raise your hand on.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Take 100% because that means you're
[1:03:54] going to have to give 100%.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Because God's not going to take anything
[1:03:58] that you won't give him. Lord, I'll give
[1:04:01] you my Sunday morning.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; But Tuesday night, you know that's mine.
[1:04:09] I'll give you
[1:04:12] my five minute prayer in the morning,
[1:04:16] but the rest of the time it's mine.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus, that spirit of Christ, it's a
[1:04:23] sweet spirit. It's just going to take
[1:04:24] what you give him and and he'll be
[1:04:26] grateful for it. He'll take as much as
[1:04:29] you want to give.
[1:04:31] But our hearts should be turned
[1:04:36] back to those ones that we read about in
[1:04:40] the Bible. Peter and James and John and
[1:04:42] Philip and Thomas.
[1:04:46] Mary Magdalene. Talked about her the
[1:04:48] other night. Mary of Bethany, Martha,
[1:04:52] all the way back. Rahab, Hannah, David,
[1:04:56] and Samuel. Moses.
[1:04:59] turn our hearts back to have that same
[1:05:01] character, that same faith that they
[1:05:03] had.
[1:05:05] That's the meaning of this scripture. We
[1:05:08] forget the second part.
[1:05:11] There was a purpose in it.
[1:05:14] Brother Brandham did a great job. He
[1:05:17] actually did it himself. He had that
[1:05:20] spirit. What was that spirit? It was
[1:05:23] love.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; My aunt Jacqueline's here. one of the
[1:05:27] few people that actually knew him.
[1:05:30] Growing up, I didn't hear stories about
[1:05:32] the miracles. I didn't hear the stories
[1:05:34] about all the great doctrines. I didn't
[1:05:36] hear any of the stories about that. You
[1:05:38] know what I heard? I heard the stories
[1:05:39] about the man and the love that he had
[1:05:42] and the the presence that was around
[1:05:44] him. That's why people loved him. That's
[1:05:46] why people admired him. He actually did
[1:05:48] it. His heart was turned back. Now, what
[1:05:51] about us?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Is it going to happen within me?
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; It's about me. It's about you.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Am I actually going to be one of those
[1:06:01] ones
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; that really serves Jesus Christ?
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Am I going to be one of those ones?
[1:06:11] I talked about Stephen on Sunday morning
[1:06:14] last week and there's something about
[1:06:17] the name Stephen and uh it's been
[1:06:20] brother Ste brother Steve and I have
[1:06:22] been talking about this. You got Stephen
[1:06:25] Young in South Africa. You got Stephen
[1:06:27] Brousone here ministering for us. You
[1:06:31] got Stephen Bryant here. There's just
[1:06:34] this these meetings. I think I'm even
[1:06:37] married to a Stephven.
[1:06:42] Actually, when we when we talk to French
[1:06:44] people, that's usually what they call
[1:06:45] her. [laughter]
[1:06:46] Oh, Stephen.
[1:06:51] My French accent isn't so good, is it?
[1:06:55] It's just been a it's it's been a
[1:06:57] blessing to me. And I mentioned this man
[1:06:59] named Stephen in the Bible. This deacon
[1:07:03] who [snorts] stood for Christ. And you
[1:07:07] know what they crucified him? You know
[1:07:08] what they stoned him for? They stoned
[1:07:10] him because they said he was against the
[1:07:12] prophet Moses.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And that was the reason. Oh, you're
[1:07:16] against Moses. Picked up the stones and
[1:07:18] killed him.
[1:07:21] because they said he was against the
[1:07:22] prophet.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Listen to what Stephen said just before
[1:07:27] he died. Preached one of the most
[1:07:29] amazing sermons. Acts chapter 6 and 7 if
[1:07:32] you want to go back to it. Acts chapter
[1:07:34] 7 verse 44. He Steven is talking about
[1:07:36] the ta the tabernacle in the wilderness.
[1:07:38] And look what he listen to what he says.
[1:07:40] our fathers
[1:07:42] had the tabernacle of witness in the
[1:07:44] wilderness as he had appointed speaking
[1:07:46] unto Moses that he should make it
[1:07:48] according to the fashion that he had
[1:07:50] seen. So God had given Moses these
[1:07:52] directions on how to build this
[1:07:53] tabernacle, which also our fathers that
[1:07:56] came after brought in with Jesus into
[1:07:58] the possession of the Gentiles, whom God
[1:08:00] drove out before the face of the fathers
[1:08:03] unto the day of David,
[1:08:05] who found favor before God, and desired
[1:08:09] to find a tabernacle
[1:08:12] for the God of Jacob.
[1:08:15] So David, this king, Moses built the
[1:08:19] tent and then hundreds of years later,
[1:08:23] here comes David and they still have a
[1:08:26] tent. But God was God would come down
[1:08:29] and he would dwell in that tent for a
[1:08:32] moment.
[1:08:34] And David wanted to give God a permanent
[1:08:37] place to dwell. Not a tent, but a brick
[1:08:41] andmortar structure.
[1:08:44] Something that would really something
[1:08:46] that would weather the storm. Something
[1:08:47] that wouldn't get old and wouldn't have
[1:08:49] to be replaced. David had a vision for
[1:08:52] it, but David couldn't do it.
[1:08:55] The next verse says, "But Solomon
[1:08:58] built him a house." Solomon did it, but
[1:09:02] it was still. That was the temple in
[1:09:04] Jerusalem. The first temple that Solomon
[1:09:07] built, it replaced that tabernacle in
[1:09:09] the wilderness. And Jesus and God, the
[1:09:11] shikina of glory would come down and
[1:09:14] dwell within that temple.
[1:09:19] But it the temple wasn't wasn't real. It
[1:09:22] was just a building. God didn't live
[1:09:25] there. He just showed up once in a
[1:09:27] while. It was never God's desire to live
[1:09:32] in a church building.
[1:09:34] We call it the house of the Lord, but
[1:09:35] it's not really the house of the Lord.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; This is the house of the Lord.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; It's the house where the tabernacles,
[1:09:44] this building in the temple, that's
[1:09:47] where, that's the house where the
[1:09:48] tabernacles of the Lord come in.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; The ones that are that dwelling place
[1:09:56] for God.
[1:09:58] That is what this tabernacle is. That is
[1:10:01] what a true church is. But the true
[1:10:05] tabernacle is the person.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; It's not the building. It never was.
[1:10:11] Remember the the tent was just a tent.
[1:10:14] The temple is just a building. But it
[1:10:16] was the God that came down into the
[1:10:18] building that made it special. And we
[1:10:21] we're just people.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; We're just flesh and blood.
[1:10:26] But it's the God that comes down and
[1:10:27] dwells within us. That's what makes us
[1:10:30] special. It's not claiming this or that.
[1:10:34] It's the real God that dwells within us.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; That's poured out upon us. Romans
[1:10:39] chapter 5 verse 5 says this. Listen to
[1:10:42] this.
[1:10:43] And hope maketh not ashamed
[1:10:46] because the love of God is shed abroad
[1:10:49] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:10:52] given to us. Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Modern translations, the modern wording,
[1:10:55] New King James Version says, "The love
[1:10:58] of God has been poured out in our hearts
[1:11:01] by the Holy Spirit who was who was given
[1:11:05] to us."
[1:11:07] So he's pouring he pours out that spirit
[1:11:11] into us. That was the motive of God in
[1:11:13] the first place. He never the the temple
[1:11:16] was never important. He wanted to pour
[1:11:18] his heart out. God wanted to pour his
[1:11:21] love into us. That was the whole purpose
[1:11:24] of it. All of the Old Testament, it was
[1:11:26] just a type. It was it was a prophecy of
[1:11:29] what was going to come to pass at the
[1:11:32] day of Pentecost
[1:11:34] when God no longer
[1:11:38] came just into the temple. Then he
[1:11:41] spread himself into the hearts of men
[1:11:44] and women. that shakina glory. It came
[1:11:47] down into the temple after Solomon built
[1:11:50] it and it was in the it was in the tent.
[1:11:52] But when it came into 120 people in the
[1:11:56] upper room, that was the real thing.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; That's when it was fulfilled. The other
[1:12:01] was just a symbol. But when it came down
[1:12:04] in a man, that is was that was the
[1:12:07] fulfillment of the prophecy.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; That was the real gift. The rest the
[1:12:14] rest of it was just a package.
[1:12:17] Ask again, what about today?
[1:12:21] Did it really happen?
[1:12:24] Have we really received the Holy Ghost?
[1:12:27] Are we that tabernacle that God dwells
[1:12:31] in?
[1:12:36] Acts chapter 4, what happened was in
[1:12:38] Acts chapter 2,
[1:12:41] the Holy Spirit came down
[1:12:44] and fell upon 120 in the upper room.
[1:12:47] They spoke with tongues. They went out.
[1:12:48] They were staggering. They were so
[1:12:50] touched by the spirit and they they
[1:12:52] prophesied and they started healing the
[1:12:54] sick and they started doing these same
[1:12:56] things that Jesus did. Now Jesus wasn't
[1:12:58] just a man.
[1:13:01] Now, he was people everywhere
[1:13:04] that had his same spirit doing the same
[1:13:06] thing. They received the Holy Ghost in
[1:13:09] Acts chapter 2. But I want you to think
[1:13:11] about this. You may say, "I received the
[1:13:13] Holy Ghost when I was 12 years old." And
[1:13:16] you look back at that time. It's good.
[1:13:19] But what about today?
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; What about Have you received the Holy
[1:13:24] Spirit lately?
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 2, they received it. Peter
[1:13:30] and John were there. John Peter was the
[1:13:32] main spokesperson. Then two parag two
[1:13:36] chapters later in Acts chapter 4, watch
[1:13:39] what happens. Same people, Peter and
[1:13:42] John and all the disciples, same one.
[1:13:44] Watch what happens. Acts 4:31, it says
[1:13:47] this.
[1:13:49] Remember couple who knows how long
[1:13:52] before they received the Holy Ghost. Now
[1:13:54] watch this. And when they had prayed,
[1:13:57] the place was shaken
[1:13:59] where they were assembled and they were
[1:14:02] all filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:14:06] spake the word of God with boldness.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; They were filled again.
[1:14:12] A revival. You ever heard of the word?
[1:14:15] I've heard it a few times over the past
[1:14:16] few days.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; And the multitude of them believed that
[1:14:22] believed. Now listen to this. Watch what
[1:14:24] it produces. I'm talking about the
[1:14:27] spirit going back, us going back to that
[1:14:30] same spirit that they have. Turn our
[1:14:32] hearts back to these these apostolic
[1:14:34] fathers, these great ones. Watch this.
[1:14:36] And the multitude of them that believed
[1:14:38] were of one heart and of one soul.
[1:14:40] Where's that today?
[1:14:42] One heart and one soul.
[1:14:46] Neither said any of them that ought of
[1:14:48] the things which he possessed was his
[1:14:50] own. But they had all things in common.
[1:14:55] The Holy Spirit filled Peter and John
[1:14:57] and the disciples again.
[1:15:02] Are we satisfied with just the package
[1:15:04] that we're in now? Are we satisfied with
[1:15:07] who we are now? Are we satisfied with an
[1:15:09] experience from 20, 30, 40 years ago? Or
[1:15:12] maybe even an experience yesterday?
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; I want more today.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; You know what? I ate that good food last
[1:15:20] night. It was good, but I haven't eaten
[1:15:22] today.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And I'm starting to get hungry again.
[1:15:27] And that's how it is with the Holy
[1:15:28] Spirit. Lord, I feel just full. I feel
[1:15:30] so good. Oh, thank you, God. It feels so
[1:15:33] good. And then tomorrow, Lord, I'm
[1:15:35] hungry again.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; I need it again
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; and again and more and more. [applause]
[1:15:45] Constant infilling of the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:48] Remember when they were when when the
[1:15:50] temple was put there, that Holy Spirit
[1:15:53] didn't come down in Jerusalem just one
[1:15:56] time when they dedicated the church.
[1:15:59] It came again and again and again when
[1:16:03] that spirit would fill the holy of
[1:16:05] holies in that room.
[1:16:09] [sighs] Or are we just satisfied?
[1:16:13] I read a scripture
[1:16:15] the other day and it we all know it and
[1:16:18] when I read it you're going to recognize
[1:16:20] it. It's in second Peter chapter 2. And
[1:16:23] it just kind of struck me and I think
[1:16:27] Lord this scripture is really relevant
[1:16:30] for even dedicating a church.
[1:16:34] Second Peter chapter 2 verse 22.
[1:16:39] The apo the uh the apostle Peter is
[1:16:41] talking about the people who return to
[1:16:43] their sins.
[1:16:46] But it has happened unto them according
[1:16:48] to the true proverb. The dog is turned
[1:16:50] to his own vomit again and the s that
[1:16:53] was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
[1:16:57] It's a strange thought. I was I've gone
[1:17:00] over the past three or four years. I've
[1:17:02] been traveling back and forth to
[1:17:04] southern Baja Mexico doing a a
[1:17:06] humanitarian work there. And there's
[1:17:09] this ranch that that has this big giant
[1:17:12] pen. It's probably I don't know as big
[1:17:14] as this whole church. And I always see
[1:17:17] this same pig in the same spot and it's
[1:17:21] this big fat s and she, you know, has
[1:17:25] these big floppy ears and she's always
[1:17:27] laying in the same spot. She's always
[1:17:29] laying in in the same mud hole. Every
[1:17:32] time I come, she never moves. I walk in,
[1:17:35] I walk walk by her, we drive by her, and
[1:17:36] there she is. You know, she's laying
[1:17:38] there. It's like, okay, has she moved in
[1:17:40] the past six months?
[1:17:43] And she has all of this area to roam.
[1:17:45] And I'm sure that she does, but she
[1:17:48] always comes back to that same mud hole.
[1:17:51] That's so often with a sinner.
[1:17:55] We may come out of our sins,
[1:17:59] but there's something that brings us
[1:18:01] back to that sin.
[1:18:04] And
[1:18:06] he also talks about this dog. As a dog
[1:18:09] returns to his vomit, I know we probably
[1:18:12] all have seen that where a dog someone
[1:18:13] will make it sick and it'll throw up and
[1:18:16] then it'll leave and then it'll come
[1:18:17] back and it'll eat it again. It's gross.
[1:18:20] I know. It's really a nasty thought. But
[1:18:24] Peter is trying to tie in us and our
[1:18:28] sins to going back and eating the vomit
[1:18:31] again.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; We We might come to the altar. We might
[1:18:35] hate the way that we are and we might
[1:18:38] just come out right there at the altar
[1:18:41] and I might change my appearance. I
[1:18:43] might I might cut a couple of sins out
[1:18:45] in my life.
[1:18:48] But am I really the same person inside?
[1:18:51] Do I still want to lay in that mud?
[1:18:57] When we're walking through our daily
[1:19:00] walk,
[1:19:01] do I find myself in mud again? And Lord,
[1:19:06] I thought I came out of this. I thought
[1:19:08] my heart was changed. I thought I am a
[1:19:11] different vessel. And here I am in the
[1:19:13] same mud. And it might be resentment of
[1:19:17] someone. It might be it might be gossip.
[1:19:21] It it might be pornography.
[1:19:24] It it could be drinking. It could be any
[1:19:27] of those things. And you find yourself,
[1:19:29] Lord, I thought I was different. I
[1:19:30] thought I had changed. And here I am
[1:19:33] right back in this pool of mud again.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Am I that same pig? Lord, I need a
[1:19:41] change in my life.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; I need I need these these demons that
[1:19:45] are are bothering me. I need them to go.
[1:19:47] And then that void that's created, I
[1:19:49] need that Holy Spirit to replace that. I
[1:19:52] need a change. That pig will always want
[1:19:55] to lay in that slop always because it's
[1:19:58] a pig.
[1:20:00] But if that nature changes,
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; then she becomes something different.
[1:20:07] And the same with with this dog, you
[1:20:10] know, you
[1:20:12] you come and and make a change in your
[1:20:15] life and then
[1:20:17] on the inside, is there still pride?
[1:20:22] Is there still resentment? Is there
[1:20:24] still sexual immorality?
[1:20:27] And is there still fear maybe that
[1:20:30] you're going to get out of your comfort
[1:20:31] zone? You know, you look down at your
[1:20:33] feet and you say, "Lord, here I am in
[1:20:34] this mud. I I want to change." or or you
[1:20:37] you you go back and and it's like, man,
[1:20:41] I thought I gave that up and I just ate
[1:20:43] it again.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; It's a disgusting thing to go back to
[1:20:48] our sins.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; We've moved past those. And I get it.
[1:20:54] You go back to the sin and it's like,
[1:20:56] "Oh, it's just disgusting. Lord, I did
[1:20:58] it again." But you place it into his
[1:21:00] hands and you constantly work. And Lord,
[1:21:03] I don't want to be that that person. I
[1:21:07] don't want to be that same person I used
[1:21:08] to be. I don't want to be that that pig
[1:21:10] in the in the muck. I don't want to be
[1:21:12] that dog that eats its puke. I want to
[1:21:15] be something different.
[1:21:18] The importance
[1:21:20] of Malachi 4
[1:21:23] is to turn our hearts back.
[1:21:27] That's the part we leave out.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; That's the part that affects me. That's
[1:21:32] that's the importance of it, but instead
[1:21:35] we're putting it on some somebody else
[1:21:37] or something else, but the importance is
[1:21:39] did it have an effect in my life? The
[1:21:42] importance of this church, it's not a
[1:21:44] video. It's not a a a new paint on the
[1:21:46] walls. It's not stone on the on the
[1:21:48] pulpit.
[1:21:50] Is it changing my life? Have I changed?
[1:21:52] That's the important thing. Everything
[1:21:54] else is just the wrapping.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's what matters with the tabernacle
[1:21:59] in the wilderness, with the temple. It
[1:22:01] was just a tent or it was just a
[1:22:03] building, but God came in there.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; That's the important thing.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Stephen
[1:22:14] verse number 48, Acts chapter 7.
[1:22:18] Stephen is saying the same thing. He
[1:22:20] says, "How be it, the most high dwelleth
[1:22:22] not in temples made with hands,
[1:22:25] as saith the prophet, heaven is my
[1:22:27] throne and earth is my foottool. What
[1:22:29] house will you build me? sayeth the
[1:22:30] Lord, or what is the the place of my
[1:22:33] rest? Hath not my hand made all of these
[1:22:36] things? Back to Romans, he said, God's
[1:22:39] love has been poured out in our hearts
[1:22:41] and he did that. He created the heavens
[1:22:43] and the earth. He separated the light
[1:22:46] from the darkness. He did these things
[1:22:48] and he gave us a Bible to read that we
[1:22:51] might know him better. Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; This Bible at the very beginning, God
[1:22:56] created the heavens and the earth and
[1:22:59] then the Holy Spirit steps on the scene
[1:23:01] and starts forming all of these these
[1:23:03] things. The Bible wasn't written. People
[1:23:06] tried to say, "Oh, well, you know, it's
[1:23:08] 6,000 years and day one and day two and
[1:23:10] try to try to figure out this and try to
[1:23:11] figure out that and then the big bang
[1:23:13] over here now and that's when uh there
[1:23:15] was moisture in the in the earth and
[1:23:17] then that protected the that built the
[1:23:19] atmosphere and it's not written for
[1:23:22] that.
[1:23:23] If God would have wanted to write a a
[1:23:26] science book, he would have chose a
[1:23:28] great scientist.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And neither is it a book of history.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; It's got good history in it. But there's
[1:23:37] things in the genealogies. It's like,
[1:23:38] well, what is was it this person or was
[1:23:40] this person was the ancestor? And you
[1:23:42] try to put it together. It wasn't
[1:23:44] written for that. If God would have
[1:23:45] wanted to write a history book, he would
[1:23:47] have chose some history professor. It
[1:23:50] wasn't written for that. This book, this
[1:23:52] Bible was written as a book of
[1:23:55] relationship between God the Father and
[1:23:58] us ourselves. You can't get the other
[1:24:01] stuff out of it. [applause]
[1:24:06] Amen.
[1:24:08] That's when you read this Bible, you
[1:24:11] see, oh, this is God dealing with us.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; This is this is him wanting a
[1:24:17] relationship. He built he made the
[1:24:18] Garden of Eden. Why? so his children
[1:24:21] could be there.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it was about. You know, day
[1:24:24] one, day two, day three. We got all the
[1:24:27] creation there and and God didn't think
[1:24:30] it was it was
[1:24:33] applicable applicable to our lives to
[1:24:35] explain how it happened.
[1:24:37] He put it there. But the main thing is
[1:24:40] that you have a relationship with me.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; God wanted to dwell with man, mankind.
[1:24:47] He wanted to dwell with women. He wanted
[1:24:49] to come down and he wanted to fill that
[1:24:51] that tabernacle in the wilderness. He
[1:24:53] wanted that fellowship. He wanted to be
[1:24:55] around people, but they were too sinful.
[1:24:57] They couldn't get close enough to him.
[1:24:58] There was no sacrifice there. If they
[1:25:01] would have got too close, they would
[1:25:02] have died.
[1:25:05] That that glory of God is too holy to
[1:25:08] where a sinful person if it comes in the
[1:25:11] presence, you couldn't even be on the
[1:25:12] same mountain
[1:25:14] or you would have died.
[1:25:17] But then he sent his son
[1:25:20] because he wanted to be he wanted to
[1:25:22] fellowship with us.
[1:25:24] He wanted that holy spirit to come down
[1:25:26] and dwell within us. So he sent his son
[1:25:28] so his son could take those sins and now
[1:25:31] he can fellowship with us like he did at
[1:25:33] the beginning.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose of the book.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I want a relationship with you. Here it
[1:25:41] is in the Old Testament. It's laying a
[1:25:42] foundation. and now I will send my son
[1:25:46] and he is the propitiation of sins. He
[1:25:48] takes those sins away and now I have a
[1:25:50] relationship with you because that's
[1:25:52] what I've wanted from the beginning.
[1:25:58] This tabernacle,
[1:26:01] this tabernacle
[1:26:03] and the tabernacle in the wilderness was
[1:26:06] made with human hands. We can come.
[1:26:09] Daniel and the the um the team can come.
[1:26:14] This was made with hands. This building
[1:26:16] was built by people.
[1:26:20] It doesn't matter. That's not the
[1:26:22] important thing. The work that
[1:26:27] that we do, we want to make it as nice
[1:26:29] as we can,
[1:26:30] but it's not it's not it's not the
[1:26:34] building. Don't look at the packaging.
[1:26:38] The main thing when you celebrate
[1:26:39] Thanksgiving, don't look at the turkey
[1:26:41] on the table, you know, and the stuffing
[1:26:43] and all of that, look at the reason that
[1:26:45] it's put there.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; When you go to when when Christmas,
[1:26:50] don't look at all the all the tensil and
[1:26:52] all the the trees and and the and the
[1:26:54] gifts. Look at the reason that that we
[1:26:57] celebrate the birth of the Messiah,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; our savior.
[1:27:02] That's what it should be about. faith
[1:27:05] is recorded in this book.
[1:27:08] The faith of our fathers is recorded
[1:27:11] right here.
[1:27:14] God wants to turn our hearts back to
[1:27:16] this, back to these men and these women,
[1:27:20] these great warriors of old. That's the
[1:27:23] purpose of it.
[1:27:26] And he said that he pours his love into
[1:27:29] this tabernacle.
[1:27:33] And Stephen
[1:27:35] before he died, he said, "You stiff neck
[1:27:37] and uncircumcised in your hearts and
[1:27:38] ears.
[1:27:40] You do always resist the Holy Ghost. As
[1:27:42] your fathers did, so do you."
[1:27:46] Friends, I want a church that's turned
[1:27:49] back to that original faith of the
[1:27:51] disciples. [music] I want that spirit
[1:27:55] that is promised. I want that spirit to
[1:27:58] to have its way in my life. I want it to
[1:28:01] be a success in my life. Not just
[1:28:04] pointing to something,
[1:28:06] but I want it to be alive in me.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; I want to be a tabernacle of witness.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; I want to be that place where God dwells
[1:28:14] because he made a way now because of his
[1:28:16] son Jesus Christ. He made a way for God
[1:28:18] to dwell within me and within you. Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; That's the most important thing. That's
[1:28:23] the point of it. That's the sum of the
[1:28:26] matter.
[1:28:28] I want a church that's been turned back
[1:28:31] to the original faith of the disciples.
[1:28:35] We'll dedicate this church. You know
[1:28:36] what? This church has already been
[1:28:38] dedicated.
[1:28:39] You know, we don't have to dedicate the
[1:28:41] church. It's been dedicated before.
[1:28:45] But I want to dedicate the tabernacles
[1:28:49] of God that come into this church.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Can we do that?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Can we dedicate those individual
[1:28:58] tabernacles that Lord, I want to be the
[1:29:02] tabernacle? It's a building. Who cares
[1:29:05] about the building?
[1:29:07] I want to be that tabernacle. Lord, the
[1:29:10] tabernacle is not 2555 nor stone.
[1:29:16] The tabernacle is right here.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; And I want my heart, Lord.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; I want my heart to turn back. I want my
[1:29:26] heart to turn back to the same faith
[1:29:27] that Peter had, that same burden that
[1:29:30] Paul had. Lord, I want that. I Lord,
[1:29:33] that's my desire. Can you imagine if it
[1:29:36] really happened? It's going to happen.
[1:29:38] Jesus prayed that there would be unity,
[1:29:41] such unity in the church that he would
[1:29:43] know that they're his disciples because
[1:29:45] of not their doctrine. We get so messed
[1:29:48] up. Not their doctrine, but because they
[1:29:51] love each other.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's too simple.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That's meat.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; The other stuff is salad.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; That is meat.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That is what really means something.
[1:30:06] That's how you will be identified,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; by your love one for another. And then
[1:30:11] he goes on to say, "And Lord, I pray
[1:30:13] that there they would love each other so
[1:30:15] much that other people would know that
[1:30:16] I'm the Messiah because of their love."
[1:30:18] Yeah. [applause and music]
[1:30:21] That's what we want.
[1:30:26] And it's not pointing our fingers at
[1:30:28] anybody else.
[1:30:30] It's pointing fingers right here. Lord,
[1:30:32] I want to be that tabernacle. If there's
[1:30:34] only one in the world, Lord, I want to
[1:30:36] be that tabernacle.
[1:30:40] This church dedication,
[1:30:43] this is not a rededication. This church,
[1:30:45] as I said, it's already been dedicated
[1:30:46] to the Lord. That's been done.
[1:30:50] I want a dedication of myself today.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; If you haven't dedicated your life to
[1:30:58] the Lord, then today is the best day to
[1:31:01] do it. And if you have dedicated your
[1:31:03] life to the Lord, today is the best day
[1:31:05] to do it.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Put in put the things that are in the
[1:31:08] past in the past.
[1:31:10] All the way all the way back. Sometimes
[1:31:12] it's like, Lord, I'm standing in the mud
[1:31:13] again.
[1:31:16] Lord, it made me sick, but I just ate it
[1:31:19] again.
[1:31:21] Made me sick again. That's what I pray
[1:31:24] that sin would be. That every time we
[1:31:27] sin, it [music] just makes us sick. Yes,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; I can't stand it, Lord. Oh, I did it
[1:31:33] again. Here I am. It just makes me sick.
[1:31:36] Then the Lord says, "Ah, now I got
[1:31:38] something to work with
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; now. Now you're doing something now. Now
[1:31:43] you're my son. I can start forming and
[1:31:46] here I come down into this vessel
[1:31:50] and fill you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:31:52] say, Lord, thank you so much. Thank you,
[1:31:54] dear God, for filling me. I know I am a
[1:31:57] child of God, but it it leaked out. I
[1:32:01] need some more. I need more. Lord, fill
[1:32:04] me again like you filled Peter and John
[1:32:06] the second time in Acts chapter 4.
[1:32:08] [music]
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And then the walls shook that the Holy
[1:32:11] Spirit was so strong the walls of the
[1:32:13] building shook and they were of one
[1:32:16] heart and one soul. Can you imagine a
[1:32:21] tabernacle, a church where everyone is
[1:32:25] one soul? They love each other so much.
[1:32:29] That's what I want to dedicate my life
[1:32:30] to today.
[1:32:32] Can we do it in one in one accord, one
[1:32:36] mind?
[1:32:38] Will you dedicate your tabernacle to
[1:32:40] God? Let's all stand.
[1:32:49] With your heads bowed,
[1:32:55] Jesus
[1:32:57] wants to fill that tabernacle.
[1:33:00] That shikina of glory that's written
[1:33:03] through the whole Bible. It wants to be
[1:33:06] in that tabernacle
[1:33:09] of flesh that you are. It wants to dwell
[1:33:12] there.
[1:33:14] God wants it. He loves us.
[1:33:17] He wrote the book so that we would have
[1:33:20] a relationship with him.
[1:33:23] Now, please, please dedicate your life
[1:33:27] to him. Dedicate your tabernacle to him.
[1:33:32] Daniel, let's let's sing while we're
[1:33:35] while we're just thinking on these
[1:33:37] things.
[1:33:43] All throughout my history,
[1:33:51] your faithfulness [singing]
[1:33:53] has walked beside me.
[1:34:00] The wind storms make way [music]
[1:34:04] for
[1:34:09] every [singing]
[1:34:10] season
[1:34:12] from [music] where I'm standing.
[1:34:18] I see [music and singing] the evidence
[1:34:20] of your goodness
[1:34:24] all over my life.
[1:34:29] All over my life
[1:34:35] and I [music and singing] see promises
[1:34:38] in fulfillment.
[1:34:42] All [singing and music] over my life,
[1:34:46] all over my life. [music]
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] Now with our heads bowed,
[1:34:58] this is not a rededication of a church.
[1:35:01] This is a dedication of a tabernacle.
[1:35:05] Dedicate your life to him, friends, now
[1:35:09] and promise him, Lord, I am yours and
[1:35:13] you are mine.
[1:35:16] Oh dear God.
[1:35:20] Lord, we thank you for all that you've
[1:35:21] given us, Lord, you've blessed us beyond
[1:35:24] measure.
[1:35:26] But, Father, may that same spirit
[1:35:31] that you promised,
[1:35:34] Lord, to turn us back
[1:35:38] to the faith of our fathers,
[1:35:41] Lord. May it be manifested in us.
[1:35:45] that spirit of reconciliation, Lord,
[1:35:49] may we be reconciled with our father
[1:35:53] after all of our sins and all that we've
[1:35:55] done.
[1:35:57] And then, Lord, may we love one another.
[1:36:02] Stand for one another, Father.
[1:36:06] Lord, I dedicate my life aresh to you in
[1:36:10] the name of your son Jesus Christ. Lord,
[1:36:13] that I might be used on this earth as a
[1:36:17] vessel, as a tabernacle, of the Holy
[1:36:19] Spirit, of the pillar of fire, of the
[1:36:21] shikina glory. Lord, may it rest within
[1:36:24] me. May it rest within each person in
[1:36:26] this building. And dear God, may it be
[1:36:30] manifested outwardly
[1:36:32] through [snorts] Lord love as you
[1:36:34] promised that you would pour the love of
[1:36:35] God out upon us. Lord, pour it right
[1:36:38] into our souls. We pray
[1:36:41] and we dedicate our lives to you in
[1:36:44] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:36:51] [singing] Reme
[1:36:53] [music]
[1:36:57] just for fear may [singing] come and
[1:37:01] feel.
[1:37:03] [music]
[1:37:07] You [singing] lead my heart to victory.
[1:37:14] [music]
[1:37:15] You are my [singing] strength and you
[1:37:20] always will be. And I see [singing] the
[1:37:25] evidence [music] of your goodness.
[1:37:29] Oh, [singing] all over my life.
[1:37:34] All over my life. [music and singing]
[1:37:40] And I see [music and singing] your
[1:37:41] promises in fulfillment
[1:37:45] [music]
[1:37:46] all over my life.
[1:37:50] All over my life. You see the cross
[1:37:56] and see the cross. The empty grave.
[1:37:58] [singing]
[1:38:00] The evidence [music]
[1:38:01] is sinless.
[1:38:04] All my sins [singing]
[1:38:06] rolled away
[1:38:08] because [music] of you. Oh Jesus.
[1:38:12] See the cross [singing] the empty grave.
[1:38:16] The [music] evidence is endless.
[1:38:20] All my sins rolled [singing] away
[1:38:24] because of you, oh Jesus.
[1:38:27] Oh,
[1:38:29] [music]
[1:38:35] and I see the [music] evidence of your
[1:38:39] goodness
[1:38:42] all over my life.
[1:38:46] All over my life.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; And I see your promises in fulfillment
[1:38:56] [music]
[1:38:58] all over my life.
[1:39:02] All over my life.

[1:39:13] What a beautiful name it is. [music]
[1:39:18] The [singing] name of Jesus
[1:39:22] Christ my king.
[1:39:26] What a beautiful name [singing] it is.
[1:39:30] [music]
[1:39:30] Nothing compares to this.
[1:39:34] What a beautiful [singing] name it
[1:39:36] [music] is. The name of Jesus. [singing]
[1:39:42] What a beautiful name it is.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful name [singing]
[1:39:48] it is. Oh, the name [music] of Jesus
[1:39:54] Christ my king.
[1:39:58] What a [music and singing] beautiful
[1:40:00] name it is.
[1:40:03] Nothing compares to this.
[1:40:07] What a beautiful name it is. The
[1:40:11] [singing and music] name of Jesus.
[1:40:22] I want to worship some more. You can be
[1:40:25] seated if you want to be seated. You can
[1:40:26] stand if you want to stand.
[1:40:29] Let's just worship.
[1:40:31] It's just good, friends. It is just
[1:40:35] good. Daniel, one more time with the
[1:40:36] evidence before we we sing.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; I see the evidence [singing and music]
[1:40:41] of your goodness.
[1:40:45] All over my life.
[1:40:49] All over my life.
[1:40:53] [music]
[1:40:55] And I [singing] see promises in
[1:40:58] fulfillment.
[1:41:01] Oh, all over my life.
[1:41:06] All over my life.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; There's a beautiful blessing.
[1:41:15] in the Old Testament.
[1:41:18] And we're going to hear it, I think,
[1:41:21] probably
[1:41:23] sang as beautiful as it's ever been
[1:41:25] sung.
[1:41:26] I think maybe the day that it was given.
[1:41:29] I wonder if it was if it was this
[1:41:31] beautiful as this blessing that's going
[1:41:34] to be sang before us now.
[1:41:39] Remember
[1:41:43] this is a dedication service.

[1:48:51] conquerors through him that loved us.

[1:53:26] Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; truly been a blessing to be in your
[1:53:32] presence, to be in your presence this
[1:53:34] morning. [snorts] Without you, Lord, we
[1:53:36] are nothing.
[1:53:38] Nothing can be done, Lord.
[1:53:41] We're going nowhere without you, Lord.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; But with you, Lord, you are the
[1:53:47] northstar.
[1:53:50] You guide us in all truth, Lord.
[1:53:54] And Lord, as we have dedicated oursel
[1:53:58] to you this morning,
[1:54:01] us Lord being the temple of the Holy
[1:54:03] Ghost,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; us Lord being the tabernacle that you
[1:54:07] wanted to dwell in.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; All these symbols in the Old Testament
