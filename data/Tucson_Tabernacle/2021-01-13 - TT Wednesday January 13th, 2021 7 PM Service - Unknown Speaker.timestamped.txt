[45:10] not for me but for your people I thank
[45:13] you in Jesus precious name
[45:17] amen before we're
[45:20] seated and if I can remember which
[45:22] button to press let's read from Acts
[45:25] chapter 16
[45:29] starting at verse 9 a vision appeared to
[45:31] Paul in the night there stood a man of
[45:34] Macedonia and prayed him asked him
[45:36] pleaded with him saying come over into
[45:39] Macedonia help
[45:41] us and after he had seen the vision
[45:44] immediately we endeavored to go into
[45:47] Macedonia assuredly Gathering that the
[45:50] Lord had called us for to preach the
[45:52] gospel unto them please be seated
[45:59] the
[46:00] uh the little coins that are up in the
[46:03] corner there I remembered at this
[46:05] time this gigantic thing that you can
[46:07] see so clearly about the size of a penny
[46:10] is actually a coin that was minted in
[46:13] Philippi and Macedonia between 31 BC and
[46:16] 14 ad so this coin was in circulation at
[46:20] the time of Jesus this physical coin was
[46:22] in the circulation in this city in this
[46:25] town at the time of the events that
[46:27] we're reading
[46:29] about and I better put it in my pocket
[46:31] or I'll leave it up here and who knows
[46:33] what'll happen right well you may recall
[46:36] last November that we read these verses
[46:39] we discussed the vision we discussed
[46:41] Paul's reaction to it we discussed
[46:44] Paul's subsequent
[46:46] persecution our takeaways that evening
[46:49] were from the letter to the Philippians
[46:51] that first we should have joy the joy of
[46:55] the Lord regardless of our
[46:58] circumstances second we need to have
[47:01] Unity we need to make peace with each
[47:03] other third we can
[47:06] disagree but we don't need to be
[47:10] disagreeable fourth we receive practical
[47:14] advice on how to avoid conflict how to
[47:17] keep our hearts and Minds clean and pure
[47:19] before God remember whatsoever things
[47:22] are good righteous pure think on these
[47:25] things and de December we delved into
[47:28] jesus' presence in the temple in the
[47:30] winter to celebrate its rededication
[47:33] under the macbes an extra biblical event
[47:35] that's still celebrated in our day is
[47:38] Hanukah our takeaways that evening were
[47:40] that we are the Temple of the Holy
[47:43] Spirit the temple of God in this
[47:46] day and that uh we need to rededicate
[47:50] our lives to
[47:52] Christ well during our quarantine
[47:54] Heather and I engaged in some further
[47:56] study of the rise of Alexander the Great
[47:59] the maban revolt and
[48:17] helenismo over into Macedonia and help
[48:20] us after he'd seen the vision
[48:23] immediately we endeavored to go into
[48:25] Macedonia assur ly Gathering that the
[48:28] Lord had called us for to preach the
[48:31] gospel unto them now they were already
[48:33] packed and ready they'd been trying to
[48:35] go to different places in Asia and
[48:36] Fergie and so forth and the Lord just
[48:38] kept stopping
[48:41] them but now he's giving them a vision
[48:44] he's giving them
[48:46] orders to carry the
[48:48] gospel to
[48:51] Macedonia now this had been the kingdom
[48:54] of Alexander's father a fellow named
[48:56] Philip II not going to get too deep in
[48:59] the history but to give you a little
[49:00] background here Philip's forces
[49:02] conquered the last free army of Greece
[49:05] in 338
[49:08] BC when did Greece regain its
[49:12] independence that was from the Turks in
[49:15] 1829 2200 years
[49:19] later Philips Macedonian army that
[49:21] conquered Greece at the Battle of Kenia
[49:26] was led these guys had a kind of a wed
[49:28] shaped uh formation and on the right on
[49:32] the right flank was Philip the king of
[49:35] Macedonia and commanding the Left Flank
[49:38] was a
[49:39] 16-year-old
[49:42] Alexander I bring this up because when
[49:46] Paul received this Vision he was in
[49:48] effect being asked to go into the belly
[49:51] of the
[49:52] Beast the source of the military might
[49:55] that swept over the entire near in
[49:57] Middle East only 400 years prior the
[49:59] culture and language and religion that
[50:01] dominated life in those reasion in
[50:03] Paul's day Rome after all adopted Greek
[50:07] religion and much of its culture and
[50:10] while Latin may have been the official
[50:11] language of Rome the New Testament was
[50:14] written in
[50:16] Greek until Augustus declared himself
[50:20] Caesar emperor and claimed to be
[50:22] descended from the gods Rome was a
[50:25] republic again
[50:27] reflecting Greek
[50:29] influence did I say Paul was asked to go
[50:31] to
[50:32] Macedonia perhaps commanded as a better
[50:36] term and notice Paul and his company
[50:39] they didn't
[50:40] hesitate they didn't argue they didn't
[50:44] say why there the Bible tells us they
[50:48] immediately endeavored to go into
[50:52] Macedonia they had complete assurance
[50:55] that the gospel was to go there
[50:58] next and isn't it interesting that they
[51:00] proceeded directly to Philippi a Roman
[51:03] Colony within
[51:05] Macedonia and they didn't stop until
[51:07] they got
[51:09] there now back in November we went into
[51:12] some depth about Paul's experience in
[51:14] Philippi not just Paul of course but
[51:17] Silas and Luke and Timothy and Lydia and
[51:22] the Jailer and the vision God was
[51:25] sending them
[51:27] to suffering and
[51:29] persecution some years later when Paul
[51:32] wrote to the Philippians he was again
[51:35] under
[51:36] arrest this time in
[51:39] Rome Luke tells us in Acts
[51:42] 28 and when we came to Rome the
[51:45] Centurion delivered the prisoners to the
[51:47] captain of the Guard but Paul apparently
[51:51] unlike the other prisoners was suffered
[51:53] was allowed to dwell by himself with a
[51:57] soldier that kept him we talked a bit
[51:59] about this uh ankle monitor of antiquity
[52:03] and how the gospel was spread through
[52:04] this means into the very Palace of
[52:08] Caesar and the last verses of the book
[52:10] of Acts ends with
[52:12] this Paul dwelt two whole years in his
[52:17] own hired house and received all that
[52:19] came in unto him preaching the kingdom
[52:22] of God teaching those things which
[52:25] concern the Lord Jesus Christ Christ
[52:27] with all
[52:28] confidence no man forbidding
[52:31] him do you find that
[52:35] curious here's this guy a prisoner
[52:40] Shipwrecked everything lost but the
[52:42] lives of the passengers and crew they
[52:44] find they make the way to Rome and
[52:46] Paul's handed over to the guards so he
[52:49] grabs his ey stone or maybe it was a
[52:51] Droid or something it's a good thing it
[52:52] was waterproof shipwreck proof and
[52:55] Fireproof
[52:57] snake proof he opens a web browser and
[52:59] he goes to VRBO or maybe Airbnb and he
[53:02] locates a convenient Villa nearby swipes
[53:05] his Roman Express Platinum Card rents it
[53:08] for a couple of years
[53:10] right no no somebody shaking their head
[53:13] no
[53:15] no how is he able to rent a house a
[53:19] villa for two years and what had to be
[53:23] one of the highest rent places in the
[53:25] entire mediter Anan World
[53:29] Rome walking distance to Caesar's
[53:32] Palace location location
[53:36] location and it was big enough that he
[53:40] could receive visitors and big enough
[53:43] that he could preach not just witness to
[53:46] the guards but preach and
[53:48] teach how was he able to do
[53:52] this he tells us in
[53:54] Philippians well let's backtrack just a
[53:56] little bit to set the stage back to
[53:59] Macedonia back to the time that he and
[54:02] his group were sent there by that Vision
[54:06] Paul will reveal an important detail
[54:08] that uh Luke neglected to mention in
[54:11] Acts
[54:13] 16 now this is when Paul's released from
[54:16] the prison after the uh Jailer and his
[54:20] family have been converted and baptized
[54:23] and and they Paul and Silas went out of
[54:25] the prison and entered into the house of
[54:29] Lydia and when they had seen the
[54:31] Brethren they comforted them and
[54:34] departed so Luke informs us that Paul
[54:37] and Silas comforted The Fellowship of
[54:39] new
[54:40] Believers but he doesn't tell us what
[54:43] the new Fellowship in Philippi did for
[54:48] them so Paul tells us in simple terms
[54:52] they supported him they gave him money
[54:54] to help him go about his missionary work
[54:56] of sharing the gospel let's read now
[54:58] from Philippians chapter 1 I thank my
[55:00] God upon every remembrance of you always
[55:04] and every prayer of mine for you all
[55:07] making requests with joy for your
[55:09] fellowship or partnership in the gospel
[55:13] from the first day until now being
[55:17] confident of this very thing that he
[55:19] which ha begun a good work in you will
[55:23] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[55:26] Christ even as it is meat means proper
[55:30] appropriate correct for me to think this
[55:32] of you all because I have you in my
[55:35] heart in as much as both in my bonds and
[55:39] in the defense and confirmation of the
[55:41] Gospel ye all are partakers or partners
[55:45] of my grace other translations say you
[55:48] share with me the special favor the
[55:50] grace of God Paul's thanking them he
[55:55] recognizing them for their financial
[55:57] support now this isn't some Greek word
[55:59] thing partnering is a common metaphor we
[56:02] still use today well let's Jump Ahead to
[56:05] the end of this letter to the
[56:06] Philippians chapter 4:1 I rejoiced in
[56:10] the Lord greatly Paul says that now at
[56:13] the last your care of me has flourished
[56:17] again wherein you were also careful but
[56:20] you lacked opportunity in other words
[56:22] you're again taking care of me as you
[56:25] always have when you had the opportunity
[56:27] to do so not that I speak with respect
[56:30] of want no I've learned in whatsoever
[56:33] State I am therewith to be content I
[56:36] know both how to be abased now that's
[56:39] having very little it's not abused and I
[56:42] know how to abound everywhere and in all
[56:45] things I instructed both to be full and
[56:49] to be hungry both to abound and to
[56:53] suffer need I can do all all things
[56:56] through Christ which strengtheneth me
[56:59] notwithstanding you have well done that
[57:02] you did communicate with my Affliction
[57:05] even though I could have managed without
[57:07] your communication you did the right
[57:10] thing verse 14 in the NIV we have up
[57:13] there yet it was good of you to share in
[57:16] my
[57:17] troubles I know how to be in need and
[57:21] how to have plenty these are physical
[57:23] things he's contrasting with spiritual
[57:26] his contentment his fullness his
[57:29] abundance is in the spiritual side the
[57:32] joy of the Lord is his strength through
[57:34] all these ups and downs of Life the
[57:38] hunger abasement need those are physical
[57:42] he depends on Christ to give him the
[57:43] strength to Bear
[57:46] them and now he makes it very clear how
[57:49] they were expressing their concern how
[57:52] they were communicating how they shared
[57:54] in his troubles he fills in what Luke
[57:57] left out in Acts 16 as they departed
[58:00] from Philippi again we're going to
[58:03] read starting in the King
[58:05] James now you Philippians know also that
[58:09] in the beginning of the Gospel that is
[58:12] when I first came to you with the good
[58:14] news when I departed from
[58:17] Macedonia no church communicated with me
[58:20] as concerning giving and receiving
[58:23] nobody else was supporting my Ministry
[58:25] at that that time I was flat broke but
[58:29] ye only for even in thessalonica you
[58:32] sent once and again unto my necessity my
[58:36] next stop after I left you and shared
[58:39] the gospel with the lost and dying you
[58:43] sent money and I really needed it Paul
[58:46] uses the word
[58:48] necessity well let's look at it in the
[58:52] New Living Translation as you know
[58:56] you Philippians were the only ones who
[58:59] gave me financial help when I first
[59:01] brought you the good news and then
[59:03] traveled on from Macedonia no other
[59:06] Church did this thank you Lydia and
[59:09] undoubtedly thank you to the Jailer even
[59:13] when I was in thessalonica you sent help
[59:16] more than
[59:17] once well back to the King
[59:21] James not because I desire a gift but I
[59:24] desire fruit
[59:26] that may abound to your
[59:29] account you will receive credit for the
[59:33] successful work in
[59:35] thessalonica because you supported me as
[59:39] I went forth with the gospel but I have
[59:42] all and abound I'm full having received
[59:46] ofus the things which were sent from
[59:50] you and listen to this an odor of a
[59:54] sweet smell
[59:56] a sacrifice
[59:58] acceptable well pleasing to
[1:00:02] God did you catch that Paul says that
[1:00:07] God accepts this giving in the same way
[1:00:11] that he accepted the carefully spelled
[1:00:13] out
[1:00:14] sacrifices of days gone by it's worship
[1:00:19] and it's ministering to God that was the
[1:00:23] priest's role in the Old Testament tab
[1:00:25] tacle and Temple in Exodus we read Thou
[1:00:28] shalt burn the whole Ram upon the altar
[1:00:30] offering the sacrifice it's a burnt
[1:00:32] offering unto the Lord it is a sweet
[1:00:36] Savor there's that word again an
[1:00:38] offering made by fire unto the Lord and
[1:00:42] in
[1:00:43] Leviticus this is the portion of the
[1:00:46] anointing of Aaron and of the anointing
[1:00:48] of his sons out of the offerings of the
[1:00:51] Lord made by fire and the day when he
[1:00:54] presented them to minister unto the Lord
[1:01:00] in the priest's
[1:01:02] office notice the sweet Savor of the
[1:01:06] sacrifice is through the office of the
[1:01:08] priest ministering to the Lord not to
[1:01:12] the congregation to the Lord on behalf
[1:01:16] of the
[1:01:17] congregation and that is exactly how
[1:01:20] Paul tells us the Lord God views the
[1:01:24] support by the Philippian Church to
[1:01:26] Paul's Ministry and bringing the gospel
[1:01:29] to those who have never
[1:01:31] heard a sweet smelling
[1:01:33] sa ministering to
[1:01:39] God back to
[1:01:41] Philippians but my God shall supply all
[1:01:44] your need according to his riches and
[1:01:47] Glory by Christ Jesus now unto God and
[1:01:51] our father be glory forever and ever
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:56] suddenly verse 19 makes sense Paul's
[1:01:59] acknowledging their financial support
[1:02:01] and is reassuring them that God will
[1:02:03] supply their financial needs in
[1:02:06] turn this isn't about supporting the
[1:02:08] local church that's an entirely
[1:02:11] different topic Paul's talking about
[1:02:14] supporting those who carry the gospel to
[1:02:18] others the missionaries who go out into
[1:02:21] the field to bring others to Christ
[1:02:27] excuse me I I hear all too often about
[1:02:30] America turning away the gospel in
[1:02:33] 1956 excuse me is there anyone present
[1:02:36] tonight who received Jesus Christ as
[1:02:39] your personal savior in 1957 or later
[1:02:42] I'd like to see your
[1:02:44] hands yeah uhhuh my my hands raised
[1:02:48] too frankly personal observation I think
[1:02:52] this is often used as an excuse to look
[1:02:55] inward Ward instead of reaching outward
[1:02:59] to
[1:03:00] withdraw instead of
[1:03:02] engaging because we're now at a stage of
[1:03:06] gleaning rather than reaping lot of
[1:03:10] effort not a lot to show for it when
[1:03:13] Heather and I were coming back on our
[1:03:15] last road trip we went through some
[1:03:17] fields of cotton that the big harvesting
[1:03:20] machines had gone through
[1:03:22] and pretty well cleaned the fields but
[1:03:24] there was still cotton in the fields
[1:03:26] there were still little bits here and
[1:03:28] there now if cotton was worth $1,000 an
[1:03:31] ounce there wouldn't have been any
[1:03:32] laying in those fields what is a soul
[1:03:35] worth what is a soul
[1:03:38] worth but you know what you might gain
[1:03:41] if you
[1:03:42] glean Ruth got
[1:03:45] Boaz oh it's hard brother Lyle people
[1:03:48] just don't want to hear yeah you mean
[1:03:52] rejection
[1:03:54] ridicule treating that perhaps is
[1:03:58] persecution well this is the last topic
[1:04:00] that I want to cover tonight in our
[1:04:02] little overview of
[1:04:04] Philippians
[1:04:05] persecution Paul makes it clear that
[1:04:09] persecution suffering on behalf of
[1:04:11] Christ is part and parcel of being a
[1:04:16] Christian and even more let's be honest
[1:04:19] most of what we call persecution for our
[1:04:22] faith here in the United States is
[1:04:23] actually rejection
[1:04:26] social isolation being teased or
[1:04:29] becoming the brunt of some unkind
[1:04:33] remarks a few years ago I read two books
[1:04:38] I think I shared a bit from one of them
[1:04:39] with you the the books are titled the
[1:04:42] insanity of God and the insanity of
[1:04:45] obedience both were written by a Baptist
[1:04:48] missionary fellow by the name of Nick
[1:04:52] Ripken in the first book the insanity of
[1:04:55] God he details his conversion becoming a
[1:04:58] missionary he wanted to be a
[1:05:00] veterinarian and ended up in Somalia and
[1:05:03] the Despair and pain of that time in the
[1:05:06] Horn of Africa in service to the Lord
[1:05:09] Death of his child murder of those who
[1:05:12] had come to Christ he tells of bounties
[1:05:16] openly advertised in the madisha
[1:05:18] newspaper for killing Christian
[1:05:20] converts the editor of the paper wrote
[1:05:23] in response to a question from a radical
[1:05:25] Muslim why not just kill the
[1:05:27] westerners it's a response killing
[1:05:30] westerners might turn them into Martyrs
[1:05:33] so it's not coste effective to kill
[1:05:35] Western Christians whose deaths might
[1:05:38] possibly Inspire additional committed
[1:05:40] Believers to come to our country and
[1:05:42] take up each martyr's mantle if however
[1:05:46] we kill their converts the Western
[1:05:49] Christians will be afraid and they will
[1:05:51] go home these Western Christians will
[1:05:54] not be able to watch their converts be
[1:05:56] killed when their converts are killed
[1:05:58] the Western Christians will leave sadly
[1:06:02] that's largely what
[1:06:04] happened
[1:06:06] persecution in the late 20th and into
[1:06:08] the early 21st century in the second
[1:06:11] book the insanity of obedience he
[1:06:13] details some of the experiences of
[1:06:15] Christians being persecuted for their
[1:06:17] faith in many places from Africa to
[1:06:19] Russia to
[1:06:21] China he makes it very
[1:06:24] clear that when we commit to following
[1:06:28] Christ we do so on his terms not
[1:06:34] ours I can't help but think of my wife
[1:06:37] as an eight-year-old girl riding in a
[1:06:40] full Land Rover in
[1:06:43] Cuba that's my sweetie right there
[1:06:45] holding her
[1:06:47] dolly don't look at that
[1:06:50] loud they were coming home from an
[1:06:52] evening service of bringing Jesus to a
[1:06:55] small V Village suddenly attacked coming
[1:06:58] under Fire her father taking three
[1:07:00] bullets to his head while the vehicle is
[1:07:02] riddled with dozens of hits from
[1:07:04] automatic weapons
[1:07:05] fire
[1:07:07] missionaries persecuted for the cause of
[1:07:10] Christ bringing hope and salvation to
[1:07:13] the
[1:07:14] lost in Philippians Paul elevates this
[1:07:17] thought suffering is not fatalistic
[1:07:21] acceptance of persecution let's read
[1:07:24] Philippians 1:29 For unto you it is
[1:07:27] given these are more gifts of the Spirit
[1:07:31] given in behalf of Christ not only to
[1:07:34] believe on him the gift of faith but
[1:07:39] also to suffer for his
[1:07:42] sake
[1:07:43] oops that's not one we often list or
[1:07:46] pray for is it anyone come up here for
[1:07:50] prayer lately asking uh why you're not
[1:07:52] suffering more for the sake of the
[1:07:54] Gospel
[1:07:57] having the same conflict which he saw in
[1:07:59] me and now here to be in me we know that
[1:08:02] Faith the ability to accept and believe
[1:08:06] is a gift from God but so is suffering
[1:08:10] so is
[1:08:13] persecution are we as fervent in our
[1:08:15] desire let alone acceptance of suffering
[1:08:18] for our witness as we are of Faith to
[1:08:24] believe let's read this in the NIV The
[1:08:27] New International Version it uses the
[1:08:29] term Grant in our day what is a grant a
[1:08:33] grants a response to a request for
[1:08:36] resources to accomplish something
[1:08:38] perhaps research or product development
[1:08:40] or
[1:08:41] something for it has been granted to you
[1:08:45] we we've examined your application we're
[1:08:47] happy to inform you that your
[1:08:49] application has been accepted we are
[1:08:52] pleased to award you on behalf of Christ
[1:08:55] not only to believe in him but also to
[1:08:57] suffer for him since you're going
[1:09:00] through the same struggle you saw I had
[1:09:02] and now he that I still
[1:09:06] have the New Living Translation makes it
[1:09:08] even clearer it's not only a gift or a
[1:09:12] grant look at the terms used here you
[1:09:15] have been given not only the privilege
[1:09:18] of trusting in Christ Faith but also the
[1:09:23] privilege of suffering ing for him we
[1:09:28] are in this struggle together you have
[1:09:32] seen my struggle in the past and you
[1:09:34] know that I'm still in the midst of
[1:09:37] it suffering and persecution go hand in
[1:09:40] hand with God's acceptance of your faith
[1:09:43] it's a privilege I like that the NLT
[1:09:47] says we're in this together and this
[1:09:50] isn't a one-time deal it's not you go
[1:09:53] through the test check the box off and
[1:09:54] go to the next you don't get through it
[1:09:57] get over it put it behind you look back
[1:09:59] on it no no Paul indicates that here at
[1:10:03] the end of his life he is still
[1:10:05] suffering and still struggling just as
[1:10:08] when he was in jail with Silas singing
[1:10:11] hymns and praises to God in the midst of
[1:10:14] horrific physical
[1:10:16] torture God sent them on the strength of
[1:10:19] a Crystal Clear Vision to persecution
[1:10:23] and
[1:10:24] suffering Paul underscores this as a
[1:10:27] promise in his last letter to Timothy
[1:10:29] second Timothy chapter 3:10 but thou
[1:10:33] Timothy has fully known because you were
[1:10:36] with me in much of what I am now going
[1:10:39] to list you stood with me and experiened
[1:10:42] the same alongside me you have fully
[1:10:45] known my Doctrine manner of life purpose
[1:10:49] Faith longsuffering charity patience
[1:10:54] persecutions of afflictions which came
[1:10:56] unto me at Antioch at Iconium at lra
[1:11:01] what persecutions I endured Paul's
[1:11:04] joying the Lord was in spite of these
[1:11:06] persecutions but out of them all the
[1:11:09] Lord delivered
[1:11:10] me yay and all that will live Godly in
[1:11:15] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:11:18] that's both a prophecy and a
[1:11:21] promise if you live a Godly manner of
[1:11:24] Life In Christ
[1:11:26] we sometimes sing every promise in the
[1:11:28] book is mine every chapter every verse
[1:11:32] every line persecution and suffering are
[1:11:36] Promises of God to all believers is this
[1:11:40] what you have in mind when you sing this
[1:11:43] song it's not what I tend to have in
[1:11:45] mind when I sing it or pray and claim
[1:11:49] the
[1:11:49] promises this isn't one that we often
[1:11:53] reach out for is it but but look Jesus
[1:11:56] made this pretty clear when he sent the
[1:11:58] 12 to preach the good news in Israel in
[1:12:00] Matthew 10 he gave them some instruction
[1:12:03] and it's pretty clear that these weren't
[1:12:05] limited to them or to
[1:12:09] them starting at verse 16 behold I send
[1:12:13] you forth as sheep in the midst of
[1:12:17] wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents
[1:12:20] and harmless as
[1:12:22] doves what do wolves do when they see
[1:12:26] sheep especially if they're a little
[1:12:28] hungry not not the Sheep but the wolves
[1:12:30] are a little hungry bye-bye sheep yum
[1:12:33] tasty snack
[1:12:36] yeah look what else he says in that same
[1:12:40] speech that same uh area of Matthew 10
[1:12:43] the brother shall deliver up the brother
[1:12:46] to death and the Father the child and
[1:12:51] the children should rise up against
[1:12:52] their parents and cause them to be put
[1:12:55] to death put to death this isn't a
[1:12:58] social media thing it's not a not enough
[1:13:01] likes on Facebook or some nasty tweet
[1:13:05] prison death persecution from within
[1:13:08] your very family as a kid I heard about
[1:13:12] this sort of thing in the Soviet
[1:13:14] Union and he goes on to say you shall be
[1:13:19] hated this is strong
[1:13:21] language not passively being ignored or
[1:13:25] put down but actively
[1:13:29] hated makes me think of our country
[1:13:31] today where all sorts of actions are now
[1:13:34] classified as hate crimes and prosecuted
[1:13:40] at the federal
[1:13:42] level who knows this could be coming our
[1:13:45] way you shall be hated of all men for my
[1:13:49] name's sake but he that endureth to the
[1:13:52] end shall be saved
[1:13:56] hated of all for Jesus name's sake for
[1:14:01] standing firm on the basic principles of
[1:14:06] Christianity that my friends is a
[1:14:08] promise just like he that believes and
[1:14:11] is baptized shall be
[1:14:13] saved hate that ultimately requires
[1:14:18] endurance this isn't a 40 meter or a 50
[1:14:21] yard dash it's a marathon endurance and
[1:14:25] applies over a length of time not just a
[1:14:27] brief
[1:14:31] moment how is Jesus treated couple of
[1:14:34] more verses down the disciple the
[1:14:37] student is not above his master his
[1:14:39] teacher nor the servant above his lord
[1:14:43] it's enough for the disciple that he be
[1:14:45] as his master and the servant as his
[1:14:49] Lord if they have called The Master of
[1:14:52] the House elub in Hebrew that's alvu
[1:14:56] means the Lord of the
[1:14:58] Flies how much more shall they call them
[1:15:01] of his
[1:15:04] household wait a minute brother Lyall
[1:15:07] aren't we told right here in Philippians
[1:15:08] 4:7 the peace of God which passes all
[1:15:11] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:15:13] Minds through Christ
[1:15:14] Jesus yeah yeah that's what we spoke
[1:15:18] about last November the peace of God the
[1:15:20] joy of the Lord but that's a spiritual
[1:15:23] blessing Jesus said a little further
[1:15:26] down in the same chapter of Matthew 10
[1:15:29] think not that I am come to send peace
[1:15:32] on Earth I came not to send peace but a
[1:15:37] sword now this season of the year
[1:15:40] December typically we we hear instead
[1:15:43] Luke 2 suddenly there was with the angel
[1:15:46] a multitude of the Heavenly Host
[1:15:48] praising God and saying glory to God in
[1:15:50] the highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[1:15:52] toward men
[1:15:55] you can have peace in your heart while
[1:15:56] on Earth General Peace On Earth Is Yet
[1:16:00] To
[1:16:01] Come Good Will toward men yeah excuse
[1:16:08] me remember what Jesus said when he was
[1:16:11] asked about Good Will toward
[1:16:13] men Master what is the great commandment
[1:16:16] in the
[1:16:17] law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love
[1:16:21] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[1:16:24] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[1:16:29] mind this is the first and great
[1:16:32] commandment and the
[1:16:33] second is like unto it Thou shalt love
[1:16:37] thy neighbor as
[1:16:40] thyself on these two Commandments hang
[1:16:42] all the law and the
[1:16:44] prophets Mark records it this way Jesus
[1:16:47] answered him the first of all the
[1:16:48] Commandments is here o Israel the Lord
[1:16:52] our God is one Lord Thou shalt love the
[1:16:55] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[1:16:57] thy soul with all thy mind with all thy
[1:17:01] strength this is the first commandment
[1:17:03] and the second is like namely this Thou
[1:17:07] shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:17:10] thyself there's none other commandment
[1:17:13] greater than
[1:17:17] these and Jesus asked when challenged it
[1:17:20] another
[1:17:21] time who is Thy
[1:17:23] Neighbor I ask us all
[1:17:26] tonight who is our
[1:17:29] neighbor oh wait a minute brother L
[1:17:31] we're talking about persecution about
[1:17:33] suffering for the gospel yeah yeah
[1:17:36] that's
[1:17:37] right this is a photo of the church I
[1:17:40] attended from age three to age
[1:17:43] six it it's located in San Jose
[1:17:46] California it's called Grace Baptist
[1:17:50] Church this image was probably taken
[1:17:52] near the time our family attended in the
[1:17:54] early in mid
[1:17:55] 1950s yeah I'm an old guy I remember
[1:17:59] seeing my brother no being baptized here
[1:18:03] asking my parents what did what is that
[1:18:05] all about I I was five or six at the
[1:18:08] time so Noah would have been 10 or 11 I
[1:18:11] remember going up those steps into that
[1:18:13] church quite well the church is located
[1:18:16] in the downtown area next to San Jose
[1:18:19] State University now malls didn't exist
[1:18:22] then there were no big box stores there
[1:18:25] was no online shopping I suspect that
[1:18:28] Jeff Bezos hadn't been born yet everyone
[1:18:31] went to the downtown area to
[1:18:34] shop today San Jose is over a million
[1:18:37] Souls when we moved there in 1953 it was
[1:18:40] barely
[1:18:42] 50,000 in the early
[1:18:45] 1950s this was a nice area of
[1:18:48] town
[1:18:50] today not so much it's filled with
[1:18:53] desperate homeless most people saturated
[1:18:57] with drug abuse
[1:19:00] hopelessness plenty of petty and not so
[1:19:03] petty
[1:19:04] crime but the church hasn't closed its
[1:19:07] doors the congregation hasn't sought a
[1:19:09] nicer location they're serving the
[1:19:12] community of which they're a
[1:19:15] part tragedy stuck there several weeks
[1:19:18] ago in mid November a homeless man was
[1:19:21] being served a meal he attacked those
[1:19:24] who were helping him two killed three
[1:19:28] more
[1:19:31] hospitalized what were they
[1:19:33] doing we read in James what does it
[1:19:36] profit my brothers though a man say he
[1:19:39] hath faith and have not works can that
[1:19:43] kind of Faith save him if a brother or
[1:19:46] sister be naked or destitute of daily
[1:19:49] food and one of you say to them departed
[1:19:51] peace be warmed and filled
[1:19:55] notwithstanding you don't give them the
[1:19:57] things that they need what is it
[1:20:00] profit what's the use even so faith if
[1:20:05] it doesn't have works is dead being
[1:20:09] alone in case you didn't get it the Lord
[1:20:12] repeats this through James just a few
[1:20:14] more verses down as the body without the
[1:20:17] spirit is
[1:20:18] dead so faith without works is dead
[1:20:24] uh these are just
[1:20:26] Christians loving their neighbors Good
[1:20:29] Will toward men oh but but brother L
[1:20:33] James is speaking about our brothers and
[1:20:35] sisters in the faith isn't he not not
[1:20:37] the World At Large we we often remind
[1:20:40] ourselves from John 13 a new commandment
[1:20:43] I give unto you that you love one
[1:20:45] another as I've loved you that you also
[1:20:48] love one
[1:20:50] another but by this shall all men know
[1:20:53] that you're my disciples if you have
[1:20:55] love one to
[1:20:58] another well this love he's talking
[1:21:00] about here is pretty intense it led
[1:21:03] Jesus to the
[1:21:05] Cross we claim to love each other take
[1:21:07] care of each other do we do we
[1:21:11] really having love one to another but
[1:21:15] Jesus also tells us in Luke 6 as you
[1:21:18] would that men should do to you do ye
[1:21:21] also to them likewise not just your
[1:21:23] brothers and sisters
[1:21:25] The World At Large if you love them
[1:21:28] which love
[1:21:30] you what than have you the Sinners also
[1:21:35] love those that love
[1:21:38] them if you do good to them which do
[1:21:40] good to you what thank have ye Sinners
[1:21:44] also do even the
[1:21:46] same if he lend to them of whom you hope
[1:21:49] to receive what thank have you Sinners
[1:21:52] also lend to Sinners and receive as much
[1:21:56] again but here's a commandment but love
[1:22:01] ye your
[1:22:02] enemies what do you think of what I
[1:22:05] think of Jesus on the cross father
[1:22:09] forgive
[1:22:11] them did he mean
[1:22:13] it were they
[1:22:15] forgiven Stephen being stoned lay not
[1:22:19] this sin to their
[1:22:23] charge love you your enemies do good and
[1:22:26] lend hoping for nothing again and your
[1:22:28] reward shall be great ye shall be the
[1:22:32] children of the highest for he is kind
[1:22:36] unto the
[1:22:38] unthankful and to the
[1:22:42] evil does that describe us does that
[1:22:44] describe me do I have that trait in my
[1:22:48] spiritual DNA from my heavenly
[1:22:52] father be ye therefore merci
[1:22:55] merciful as your father also is
[1:22:59] merciful and don't we desire God's mercy
[1:23:02] not as judgment do we really truly love
[1:23:08] our
[1:23:09] enemies are we kind to the
[1:23:14] unthankful what about to the
[1:23:17] evil our love for each other should be
[1:23:20] unique at a higher level mirroring Jesus
[1:23:23] committed love
[1:23:25] to
[1:23:27] us but we're also
[1:23:29] commanded it's required it's not an
[1:23:32] option or only if we feel like it to
[1:23:34] love those outside our fellowship
[1:23:36] outside our
[1:23:38] faith specifically
[1:23:41] including our
[1:23:43] enemies genuine
[1:23:45] love
[1:23:47] unfeigned
[1:23:50] heartfelt
[1:23:52] love here's what Jesus said about those
[1:23:55] Folks at Grace Baptist
[1:23:57] Church then shall the righteous answer
[1:24:00] him saying Lord when saw we thee hungry
[1:24:02] and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee
[1:24:04] drink when saw we thee a stranger and
[1:24:07] took thee in or naked and clothed thee
[1:24:08] when saw we thee sick or in prison and
[1:24:10] came unto thee and the King shall answer
[1:24:14] and say unto them verily I say unto you
[1:24:17] in as much as ye have done it unto one
[1:24:19] of the least of these my
[1:24:22] brethren you have done it unto me you
[1:24:26] don't know who Jesus is veiled in or
[1:24:30] what their state of relationship is with
[1:24:33] him the people of this church were
[1:24:36] attacked they were persecuted right here
[1:24:39] in 21st century America two dead three
[1:24:44] hospitalized just for being a good
[1:24:46] neighbor trying to let their light shine
[1:24:49] in spite of the Danger trying to share
[1:24:52] the love of Jesus with the less
[1:24:58] fortunate I have to ask
[1:25:00] myself
[1:25:02] Lyall how's my spiritual Investment
[1:25:06] Portfolio doing right now is it paying
[1:25:10] dividends or is it just focused on value
[1:25:15] growth
[1:25:17] Doctrine avoiding
[1:25:19] dividends avoiding witnessing
[1:25:25] how's your spiritual Investment
[1:25:26] Portfolio I'm preaching now maybe I'm
[1:25:29] meddling I'm preaching to Lyle Johnson
[1:25:32] even if I'm not raising my voice even if
[1:25:34] I still have my coat still
[1:25:36] on this is
[1:25:38] hard am I taking up my
[1:25:41] cross or am I avoiding
[1:25:44] it brother green often referred to
[1:25:47] persecution as spiritual dividends Mark
[1:25:51] 10 Jesus answered and said verily I say
[1:25:54] unto you there's no man that has left
[1:25:58] house or Brethren or sisters or father
[1:26:01] or mother or wife or children or lands
[1:26:04] for my sake and the
[1:26:06] gospels but he shall receive a h
[1:26:08] hundredfold now in this time houses and
[1:26:11] Brethren sisters mothers children lands
[1:26:15] with
[1:26:16] persecutions and in the world to come
[1:26:18] eternal life the more we give up for the
[1:26:23] Lord
[1:26:24] the more will be
[1:26:26] persecuted are we excited by this do we
[1:26:30] shout Amen to this
[1:26:34] promise no no no neither do I but it's
[1:26:38] still part and parcel of our faith so
[1:26:41] how does this
[1:26:42] work what why is this a good thing how
[1:26:46] is this a privilege that were
[1:26:49] granted this isn't again referring to
[1:26:52] peer pressure
[1:26:54] Facebook or anything but brother Lyle
[1:26:59] doesn't persecution mean we failed
[1:27:01] somehow why does God let me suffer why
[1:27:05] does he withhold healing from me why am
[1:27:08] I still in pain
[1:27:09] or let's be very
[1:27:12] clear suffering is not a discredit to
[1:27:16] the gospel or to the power of God it's
[1:27:20] an opportunity to partner with God God
[1:27:24] to display the power of the Gospel
[1:27:28] there's more impact to singing praises
[1:27:31] in our pain than singing praises having
[1:27:34] never experienced pain our witness is
[1:27:38] not how well we might Tiptoe Through the
[1:27:41] Tulips it must show our
[1:27:44] character or lack of
[1:27:49] character back to
[1:27:51] Philippians wherefore my beloved as ye
[1:27:54] have always obeyed not as in my present
[1:27:57] only but much more so in my absence work
[1:28:02] out your own salvation with fear and
[1:28:05] trembling other translations read work
[1:28:08] hard to show the results of your
[1:28:12] salvation this isn't coasting
[1:28:14] downhill it's work requires effort for
[1:28:19] it is God which worketh he's not
[1:28:22] coasting either he's putting forth
[1:28:25] effort too it's God working in you both
[1:28:28] to Will and to do of his good
[1:28:33] pleasure remember it's all about him
[1:28:38] it's not about us he's the
[1:28:41] Potter we're the
[1:28:43] clay we're in his hands to do as he
[1:28:47] pleases Thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy
[1:28:51] for thou has created all things for your
[1:28:53] pleasure right right we read in
[1:28:55] Revelation if he's the Potter and we the
[1:28:57] clay maybe he's fashioning a beautiful
[1:29:00] vase or maybe he's making a chamber pot
[1:29:04] it's his choice it's not yours it's not
[1:29:09] mine do all things without murmurings
[1:29:13] and
[1:29:14] disputings why that she may be blameless
[1:29:17] and harmless the sons the children of
[1:29:20] God without rebuke in the midst of a
[1:29:24] crooked and perverse Nation welcome to
[1:29:27] Leota our first stop is Arizona
[1:29:31] USA among whom you shine as lights in
[1:29:35] the
[1:29:37] world my mother-in-law often sang a song
[1:29:40] her version of the song at any rate
[1:29:42] something like this I I I can't do it
[1:29:45] quite with her pitch but it was brighten
[1:29:49] the corner where you are brighten the
[1:29:53] corner where you are someone far from
[1:29:56] Harbor May behold the light afar
[1:30:00] brighten the corner where you
[1:30:05] are which she did for most of her 99
[1:30:10] years again Jesus put it this way let
[1:30:14] your light so shine before men that they
[1:30:18] may see your good works and glorify your
[1:30:21] father which is in heaven
[1:30:25] how do you let your light
[1:30:27] shine many ways of course but the one
[1:30:31] that Paul is emphasizing to the
[1:30:33] Philippians and therefore to us is to
[1:30:36] rejoice in the midst of personal
[1:30:38] suffering and
[1:30:43] loss let's read
[1:30:45] on holding forth the word of
[1:30:48] life that I may rejoice in the day of
[1:30:52] Christ that I have not run in vain
[1:30:54] neither labored in vain Paul's depending
[1:30:57] on the church at Philippi to hold their
[1:30:59] testimony in the face of internal and
[1:31:02] external pressures so Paul can hold on
[1:31:05] to his my brothers my sisters we are
[1:31:09] each one of us in this together each of
[1:31:13] us affects the other hold fast yay and
[1:31:19] if I be offered upon the sacrifice and
[1:31:21] service of your faith I joy and rejoice
[1:31:26] with you all for the same cause also do
[1:31:28] ye joy and
[1:31:30] rejoice with
[1:31:33] me as the musicians
[1:31:35] return we'll close with this thought
[1:31:38] then stated so eloquently and
[1:31:41] consistently by
[1:31:43] Paul we're in this
[1:31:47] together so let's learn to rejoice in
[1:31:51] spite of and in the midst of suffering
[1:31:54] and
[1:31:55] rejection learn to stick together to
[1:31:59] hold fast to the Hope which lies within
[1:32:02] us reaching out to others and supporting
[1:32:06] one another in prayer and
[1:32:09] fellowship not being slack supporting
[1:32:12] those who are bringing the gospel to the
[1:32:14] lost and the dying they're still out
[1:32:16] there you
[1:32:18] know we're still here therefore there
[1:32:21] are still some that must hear the good
[1:32:23] good news and come to relationship with
[1:32:26] Jesus
[1:32:27] Christ we must die to ourselves every
[1:32:31] day that we draw
[1:32:33] breath continue the struggle as Paul so

[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:00] his I
[1:38:02] pledge
[1:38:04] alance
[1:38:08] to
[1:38:10] the when you Pledge Your Allegiance to
[1:38:13] something you're giving your
[1:38:16] all when they would pledge their
[1:38:18] allegiance to the
[1:38:20] king or if you were in the military and
[1:38:23] you had a commanding officer and you
[1:38:25] pledged to to do what they said you put
[1:38:28] your life in their hands but they also
[1:38:31] put their life in your hands because
[1:38:34] this was part of you see when you Pledge
[1:38:37] Your Allegiance to the king of kings and
[1:38:39] Lord of lords he walked this way
[1:38:42] already he was persecuted he was
[1:38:46] hated he was hung on a cross he shed his
[1:38:50] blood for you and me he doesn't ask me
[1:38:53] to shed my blood to save myself because
[1:38:56] he did that already but he asked for a
[1:38:59] willingness of heart to say whatever it
[1:39:02] takes Lord that's what I'll be willing
[1:39:04] to do if it
[1:39:07] means the joy of God's salvation that I
[1:39:10] have shared that I have got to know to
[1:39:13] give it to someone else then I'd be
[1:39:15] willing to give my life for someone else
[1:39:18] to have
[1:39:19] that you know and sometimes as as
[1:39:21] brother Lyall was speaking I I find
[1:39:24] myself a bit embarrassed for some of my
[1:39:27] actions when he said not my will but thy
[1:39:30] will be done Lord and I'm saying Lord
[1:39:33] can we modify the will a little bit
[1:39:35] sometimes can we find an easier way to
[1:39:37] go but let us hold fast let us say Lord
[1:39:41] one more time maybe maybe we just bow
[1:39:43] our heads in you in your own way just
[1:39:46] tell the Lord One More Time Lord
[1:39:48] whatever it takes Lord I'll be willing
[1:39:50] to do Lord I I want to surrender my will
[1:39:54] my thoughts my ideas my being everything
[1:39:57] Lord to you
[1:39:59] first to you Lord that the joy of the
[1:40:02] Lord the peace of God that I've got to
[1:40:05] sh know and have and the the confidence
[1:40:08] and and the reassurance of God in my
[1:40:10] life could be given to others also Lord
[1:40:13] a hope like that Thief there at the
[1:40:16] cross who turned and looked at you at
[1:40:19] the last second and said father remember
[1:40:22] God remember me when you come into your
[1:40:25] kingdom and you didn't turn against him
[1:40:28] you didn't say because of you I'm up
[1:40:30] here too but you looked at him and say
[1:40:32] this
[1:40:33] day be with me in Paradise Lord may we
[1:40:36] have that same attitude Lord whatever it
[1:40:39] takes that someone else may get to know
[1:40:42] you and to love you and share the life
[1:40:46] of Jesus Christ is our prayer Lord help
[1:40:48] us to be willing to say yes Lord in
[1:40:51] Jesus name amen
[1:40:55] though the ship is battered it'll still
[1:40:58] make it through the
[1:40:59] storm though life seems hard and the
[1:41:02] waves come and your life seems to be
[1:41:04] upside down and nobody is he said I'll
[1:41:07] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[1:41:09] I'll be with you see the gospel covers
[1:41:12] it all covers it all and every part of
[1:41:15] it even the humanity the the the the
[1:41:19] faults and the failures of of humans
[1:41:21] like you and me are written down in the
[1:41:24] scriptures it's not just perfect
[1:41:26] Christians it's people like you and me
[1:41:29] who said yes Lord and he would use us so
[1:41:32] love him for that thank you brother
[1:41:33] Lyall some of those that's that's hard
[1:41:36] to preach yes that's hard to preach
[1:41:38] because you have to look at yourself
[1:41:41] very closely doing this so
[1:41:45] amen just a couple of announcements
[1:41:48] before we go brother Matt got a chance
[1:41:50] to speak with him he if you tried
[1:41:52] contacting him on the phone or anything
[1:41:54] the last few days there was a a severing
[1:41:58] of a in some construction or they were
[1:42:00] doing in they separate quite a few of
[1:42:02] the lines and Verizon was affected he
[1:42:05] could not make take any incoming or
[1:42:07] outgoing phone calls for two days and
[1:42:10] today we were able to talk so Lord
[1:42:11] willing brother Matt will be here this
[1:42:13] weekend and uh coming in I believe he
[1:42:16] said on Friday through Monday Monday is
[1:42:19] brother Matt's
[1:42:21] birthday so if you'd like to maybe get
[1:42:23] him a card or something like that that
[1:42:24] would be nice it would be nice to show
[1:42:26] our appreciation so uh he's a young man
[1:42:30] 37 38 years old so um I told him I said
[1:42:34] I thought you told me you were 36 So you
[1:42:36] you're turning 37 he goes I thought I
[1:42:38] was 37 turning 38 and he goes but I'll
[1:42:42] take yours better so but you know one of
[1:42:44] these days it'll be worth it all through
[1:42:48] it all I've learned to trust in Jesus
[1:42:50] through it all I've learned to trust in
[1:42:52] God so the Lord be with you and and when
[1:42:55] things seem to be going backwards just
[1:42:57] say Lord thank you because you're still
[1:43:00] in charge of this and he watches over us
[1:43:02] he keeps I had a testimony from his
[1:43:04] sister today she was driving down on her
[1:43:06] way to work and a car blew out a tire
[1:43:09] the tire came off completely and there
[1:43:11] was a semi TR right in front of her and
[1:43:13] the traffic was packed and she saw the
[1:43:15] tire come off go underneath the truck
[1:43:18] and she say I had nowhere to go that
[1:43:21] tire was going to hit me dead on
[1:43:23] it jumped up in the back of a semi-
[1:43:25] Traders they have that um that that bar
[1:43:28] that comes down kind of a block and the
[1:43:31] tire hung right up on that and allowed
[1:43:34] her to slow down and back off and then
[1:43:36] the tire fell off and went sideways and
[1:43:38] she said I just have to praise the Lord
[1:43:40] because no matter what the situation he
[1:43:42] doesn't leave us so when things look
[1:43:45] hard things look different you might you
[1:43:47] know I remember my dad telling me when
[1:43:50] when his family became a Christian in
[1:43:53] the 40s and the 50s his grandfather my
[1:43:57] great-grandfather was a
[1:43:59] bootlegger they they ran alcohol and all
[1:44:02] of that and the Lord got a hold of his
[1:44:05] life and changed him completely he
[1:44:07] became a street corner
[1:44:08] preacher my dad said he was about 13 14
[1:44:11] years old and my great grandpa would be
[1:44:13] preaching and they'd come and throw
[1:44:15] things at him spit at him and everything
[1:44:18] and my dad wanted to fight every one of
[1:44:21] them and Great Grandpa would lean his
[1:44:24] hand on his shoulder and say leave him
[1:44:26] alone son this is for the Gospel of
[1:44:28] Jesus Christ see that's what God does in
[1:44:31] your heart for you you say Lord my
[1:44:33] neighbor my neighbor mean my but maybe
[1:44:36] they could have a chance also so let's
[1:44:39] keep that attitude always and at times
[1:44:42] when things get hard just say thank you
[1:44:44] Lord that you've I've been counted
[1:44:46] worthy to suffer for you amen through it
