a request of some dear grandmother that is always prepared if you happen to have a little band-aid in your purse i would ask you to give me that band-aid this evening amen or maybe they got a first aid kit i hooked that little cut that i got on the inside of my suspender a while ago and uh just as i was putting my mic on and let me tell you right now it hurt uh but i cut that on a piece of gutter the other day and it's kind of been a little tender amen so if i get i just don't want to get that on my new suit that's the only thing praise the lord god bless you well maybe our grandmas aren't as prepared as oh well we got a grandpa that was mighty prepared amen come come doctor dr arne peterson here god bless him give him a hand this evening i sure appreciate that i i was i thought it was going to be all right but it just kept kept leaking i don't know i just you're doing a great job so far you're not supposed to touch that white part unless you wash your hands excellent thank you sir all better now and give it give a kiss no i'm good all right thank you sir yeah i bought them brand new gloves and they had uh there was the ones with the fingers out of them so i could and i hit that piece of metal just beyond the end of that glove i never had one of them fingerless gloves before and so the first rattle out of the box had cut the end of that finger i thought my goodness i'm gonna get fingers in all my gloves from now on i'm gonna do that no more but anyways god bless you this evening and trust it all as well brother mark you set an awful far back for an amen corner and we appreciate brother mark there and each and every one of you amen this evening coming out amen if you have your bibles invite you to the scripture this this evening in the book of colossians chapter 1 and we ministered this morning on examining the deity of christ and this evening i'd like to follow that thought with examining christ in you and so we're just going to follow a little bit of a thought process that we have there and it may not go exactly the way that we maybe thought that it would but there's many good little nuggets in here we spent a lot of time this morning we made reference to a lot of bible verses and but we stayed a lot in the quotes this evening we'll stay a lot with bible verses and make more reference to the quotes and we'll just see how things dovetail very nicely i appreciate a message that is bible-based amen praise the lord in colossians chapter 1 we want to read one verse of scripture there and verse 27 colossians chapter 1 and verse 27 to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles this is this is a mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory may the lord bless the reading of the word this evening as you make yourselves comfortable amen i'm trusting that we got our powerpoint there dear brother and amazing this is this is this is an awesome age that we live in because we can we can we can all read these things together i want to start this evening this is uh brother branham we read this quote this morning it says and that brought forth the very creative blood of god to redeem us from our life coming in here being born of sexual desire and then that blood was drawn out of god with us is that right emmanuel's veins on calvary's cross and today has the same saving redeeming holy power that it did the day that the transfusion was made out at calvary you believe it that's what we're just reading the quote amen now that's right we're redeemed by the blood of god the bible says that we are bought by the blood and redeemed by blood god's own blood so we spent a goodly amount of time this morning breaking down each of these highlighted potions now then we understand that the bible says that you are not your own is that right amen they were my wife was reading a bit of an article listening to an article this afternoon how that they were going to they were forcing the air national guard to take the vaccination or they would uh uh that they would withhold their pay uh another place that they there was actually uh military people were going to be uh their service was going to be terminated with other than honorable conditions and they were going to lose out on a military career unless they took the vaccination and there was all this big hype and everything as to you know that it was unconstitutional everything but i'm sorry i've been there done that amen got the tattoo to prove it amen if god if the u.s government says you take a shot you take a shot there's no questions you're not because why you're not your own you sign the dotted line you belong to the us government you're a property of the united states government with a single commander-in-chief and you've got to do what he said you signed the dotted line they tell you that before and you raised your hand and you swore an oath well uh unfortunately that's man's army and i you know i i feel sorry for them boys because it's really not right for them to have to lay down their life like that and and then be expected to take some sort of a vaccination that there's no scientific proof that it'll help you nominate a prone or khan on whether or not we should take the vaccination or not because some vaccinations were very good in time past such as polio and all these different things but there's so there there's no there's not enough given enough time on the modern day vaccinations for covid for them to go ahead and mandate that you get it now then if you voluntarily go and do that because you have confidence in that then it's not in the vaccination but your confidence is in god and that god is able to keep you in your soul now it's faith is your victory and you're trusting god you're not trusting in the vaccination so if your job requires it or whatever then you know go with the dictates of your heart and you know i don't think it's a place here at the pulpit for us to make a a gripe or an argument over the pros and cons of something that we really don't know unless you're a medical professional then you have some room for an argument but i don't have that and you know for me personally i'm just going to trust god for now and just keep moving on but but but what we come from was that uh where that the scripture says you are bought by the blood you're not your own amen aren't you glad for that that i'm not my own i belong to jesus praise the lord he bought and paid and redeemed me as we said this morning that redeemed redemption speaks of prior ownership and so he was able to buy you who were sold under sin is that right sold under sin put in the devil's pawn shop but you belong to god first and so then god comes back he knows those who are his and therefore he can purchase you back through redemption by the blood god's own blood now in second corinthians it says to win that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now i really like this this uh this statement here of the word of reconciliation reconciliation has the um it has a really neat uh definition uh over i was reading a commentary i think it was spiro zodiates and he made a comment he said that reconciliation speaks of the the elasticity or the the the recoil of an elastic property so we all understand what elastic is right you know you got you got a rubber band and that's elastic in other words it it it stretches to full capacity and then it comes back and so i i like this word reconciliation because it speaks of this elasticity or coming back to this relaxed state that it because we are stretched all right is that right so we look at laodicea laodicea has brought us through the seven church ages now we've come and it's and we're stretched to capacity but now at the end of the ages there's going to come a message or a word of reconciliation that will bring us back hallelujah from that tinsel from that stretched condition back to a relaxed state oh i like that i just i just think that's marvelous because i if you i wish i had a rubber band here but if we stretched it to its maximum and we let it go all of a sudden what happens it flies away amen oh what's going to happen to the church in a moment and in a twinkling of an eye i'm talking about the word of reconciliation that's going to bring us from this this this this stress express hallelujah from this rat race from this from this nervous tension of an age that we are not designed to live in and god is going to bring us to a relaxed state called the wedding supper of the lamb and i'm going to fly away some glad morning when this life is over i'll fly away amen i'm not going to stay here another minute longer than what i'm supposed to amen i want to get out of here in a moment in a twinkling of an eye i'm talking about amen a word of reconciliation in romans chapter 5 it speaks of an imputed righteousness now the bible one of the compound redemptive names of jehovah is jehovah sick in you and this means the lord our righteousness in other words he has become our righteousness that we had no righteousness of our own our righteousness is as of filthy rags is that right and so the the filthiness of those rags is is the best that we can produce but the bible says that even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ aren't you glad for that unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god but being freely being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ so that now that our redemption is based upon the righteous lamb of god taking our place he took my place he put on the robes of my unrighteousness he became sin so that i could become righteousness through the faith of the son of god now because we had all sin but without him there is no redemption but he justified or made it as though we had never done it in the first place brotherhood tells us that's the definition of justified is that we never done it in the first place freely amen aren't you glad that it was freely by grace so grace is the unmerited gift or the unmerited favor of god that you receive without works for amen we are saved through grace not by works but yet we do works because we are saved because we are the children of god because we have been redeemed and therefore we manifest the life that was in christ for it's christ in you the hope of glory now he said whom god hath sent forth to be a propitiation now this word propitiation we're going to spend some time on through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of god now there's a lot of language here but basically what we're seeing here is that faith amen has uh uh appropriated our faith has appropriated our righteousness which has been imputed to us in other words that that we didn't deserve it but yet god placed his righteousness upon you you didn't deserve it it was it was a free gift it was free to you but it wasn't free hello it cost somebody something that's how he could say that you are bought with the price the precious blood of jesus so this word propitiation is what carries that the weight of our redemption without a perpetuator then our redemption uh is cheapened you see and so we can't cheapen the redeemer is that right amen but when you see the the pricelessness of the redeemer then you understand what the price was paid for you deal moody said it like this amen he said i'm not too concerned about what man thinks about me i'm only concerned about what god thinks about me you tell me what christ is worth and i'll tell you what i am worth amen that right he said sitting before me is he said he said if i had in my hand a charger with two drops of the literal blood of jesus christ in it he said he said it would be so precious to me he said but sitting before me is something more precious amen so you are the purchase of that blood the purchase is more valuable amen than the price paid the word perpetuation uses the word an expiratory it is used in the sense of the ending of rage or sorrow or pain or suffering or embarrassment or any of the negatives that you want to find there it is the end of rage it's the end of sorrow by suffering it to the full it comes from the latin word expiate or to appease by sacrifice in other words that there was a price that had to be paid to rid mankind of sorrow and suffering of guilt and shame and death so there could only be a there had to come a perpetuator there had to become an expiratory and so the only one that could do that to pay the price he had to experience your pain to the full are you with me this evening somebody had to fulfill by experiential taking upon himself the full measure of suffering in other words he had to drink the dredges of the wrath of god the wine press had to be trot out in its fullness it couldn't be a partial that's why when satan met the lord jesus on the mount of temptation and he offered him all the kingdoms and the glory of all the kingdoms if he just bowed down what he could because he was the owner is that right he owned the physical property he lost it because it was sold under sin so satan could give him the glory of glory why because he was the god of the evil age he was he was a prince and power of the air he had the authority to give it but if he give it if he gave it to christ without suffering then at a later date he could have laid claims on it because the price hadn't been paid and there was no abstract so there had to come an abstract in other words the price had to be paid the history had to be searched all the way back to the originator amen and all the debts against it had to be paid and the only way that that could be done was through an expiratory hallelujah and so christ then becomes a perpetuator he becomes the one because he suffered in fullness he took upon him that's why when he's hanging there on the cross and he said i thirst i might not get any further than this amen he said i thirst amen who was he he created all the water couldn't he have put a drop upon his own tongue he was a creator couldn't he have at least amen somehow bypassed the scripture said that his tongue claimed to the roof of his mouth he was dying of thirst of dehydration of blood loss think about it he was dying there he suffered but what he said i thirst and they didn't give him water to drink but they put vinegar and gall amen which made it even worse amen so that he would suffer to the fullness because in order to pay the price for your thirst to pay the price for your suffering to pay the price amen for your sickness he had to bear the fullness of it and therefore he could be the expiratory suffering it to the full it speaks of the atoning victim it speaks especially of the lid of the ark of the covenant the mercy seat this is what jesus is to me wrath was my punishment it was my paycheck for the wages of sin is death oh but the gift of god amen is mercy through the lord jesus christ in the book of numbers chapter 19 verse 1 the bible says and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying i just threw this note in there so here was god's prophet on the earth and god speaks to his prophet the prophet then speaks to aaron which is his ministry is that right and then the ministry then speaks to the people that order has never changed it has never changed not even in the modern era with the benefit of tapes and these kind of things where we can hear directly you and i can hear directly what the prophet of god said to the world and that prophet of god tells us that there would be a fightful ministry upon the earth and a group of young men that will take the church on out to the rapture and so we don't disregard even though it's a day of a modern era we still are able to take the words of a prophet because they're not my words they're not even the prophet's words sorry they are god's words and there is an order to those words getting to you and i heart now then everybody needs a preacher even preachers need preachers for it's the perfecting of the saints so we all come to the the to the to the stature of the fullness of christ that's what the bible says now so so here we see this order coming down from god to the prophet from the prophet to the ministry from the ministry to the people and this is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak to the children of israel that they bring me a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke now each one of these brother brown said speak expressly of christ these are all type shadow uh uh scriptures that deal from old testament shadow or type to the modern era antitype everything is fulfilled in christ and in the church now this is going to move forward we're going to read a little bit of scripture here so you just follow with me and i'll try to uh go quickly i paid forward this morning i i didn't preach very long this morning so i maybe give me a little bit on the backside this evening now and you shall give her to eloise of the priests that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall say slay her before his face and elies of the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle her brother directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times now each one of these speaks of when you see this seven times brother brown goes back and picks those up and says it speaks of the seven ages and how that there would be grace in all seven ages now it goes on he said and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood and her dung shall he burn and the priest shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and each one of these remember has types the cedarwood speaking of calvary and the hyssop speaking of faith and scarlet and each one of these having a an application and cast it in the midst of the burning of the heifer now the heifer itself represented christ and he goes on here to say that a man with uh that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer lay them without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel this is what it's for for a water of separation it is a purification for sin now this is the scripture where brother branham makes reference to the thinking man's filter is that right and so from this thinking man's filter is the separation of sin so what was what what filters water but charcoal is that right and so water poured through ashes comes forth as in it's the only place in the bible where it speaks of holy water now then this this holy water or this water of the separation it is a purification for sin now there's a lot of things that we could go back to but it was to identify one of the things it was to do was to identify a a woman who had been either true to her husband or had been untrue to her husband and she would have to drink of that water mixed with dust and that was one of the things that would prove whether or not uh she was had been true or not and that's a message in itself but but we see that this these types are going forward here and i just want to get to this one place that brother brown picks this up he says now this heifer was to be a distinguished heifer or one different it was to be a heifer that was red in color without one spot on it now there's been a lot of time spent on preaching of the red heifer and and how they literally have to comb this this bovine from head to toe and they if there's one gray or black hair that they find it's disqualified so it's quite a quite an ordeal and so it takes years to find this one heifer that they can use for the ashes uh that this in its ashes but they were there you see they're looking after a natural animal to fulfill an old testament law but what they failed to recognize was that this heifer has already come and that that heifer was fulfilled in christ amen he became our red heifer a separation from sin now but brother branham puts in some really neat notations here now all those had things and had a significance to them they had a meaning every little detail had a meaning what they meant to those people in the type what ought it mean to us in the antitype that right what they've done with it there under the law what could we do under it with it today under the baptism of the holy ghost or the holy spirit see if they had the shadow we got the positive c they had the negative we got the positive they had the picture in a negative we've got it in a positive after it's been developed at calvary amen this is what i want to get you to and we went to calvary with the lamb so you see even though you look at me and i look at you and we look around us and we see the negative but yet when you look at it through the eyes of calvary when you look at it through the eyes of christ that we went there with him the bible says amen that when he left the earth that he went unto the father what bearing precious seed hallelujah and he shall come again and bring his sheaves with him mature seed hallelujah so he took us in the infancy he impregnated us at calvary what does the bee do brother bam talks about the pollen and the pistols in the church age book you know what i'm talking about and so the flower there what is it but then what does that be of death do that be of death comes it begins to trump down the little flower and when the bee is done with a flower it's bruised it's marred amen it's it's bones staring at him hallelujah he's broken down but what did he do he didn't he done it a favor the be of death what did it do but it pushed amen those pollens down into the pistols which goes down inside the seed it dies goes into the grave is buried but what it comes up again in resurrection oh you see what happened when the bee of death was stinging the lord jesus brother said he stuck his stinger in too far and he pulled out a stinger but what did it do it it it caused amen that that that lord jesus now he now has pregnant seed within him he goes down into the grave smites the devil in the face with your sins rises up triumphantly on easter morning ascends unto god taking you with him i was i was crucified buried went to hell with my savior my sins were paid in him and i rose up on easter morning amen now i am waiting for the change of my body oh think about it amen so we went through the acids we went through we got the positive after it's been developed at calvary and we went to calvary with the lamb just like snapping a picture you're the negative any negative has to go to the dark room through acids to develop the picture to make you see what it is we are now in the express image of him not this guy not the outside man i'm the express image of a of a train wreck huh i'm the express image of an adulterous affair by a man and a woman born illegitimately i'm just i'm just a i'm just a in my flesh how we're just we're an accident looking for a place to happen but according but because through christ i went to calvary and went through the acids to be developed to make us see what it is so once i go to calvary by faith and i resurrect with him when i look in the mirror through the perfect law of liberty i see a redeemed son of god hallelujah the express image of him it's the negative has been taken we're human life but we must go into the dark room down into the grave to go through the developing to come back in the uh back forth in the image oh my young forever come on old people time to shout this this evening young forever and all the old age and all the defects and everything will be taken away as job said in my appointed time i'm waiting for my change to come hallelujah now speaking of the red heifer again now she was killed without the camp and eliezer i can't stand behind this desk very easy i really like these big words i don't have to have my readers on hey man let's let me get down here in my notes here so i can read this a little bit oh my where am i this might go faster than you thought now yes and now she was killed without the camp and eliezer had to watch her being killed and then when she was dead he had to get the blood and stripe it upon the door of the tabernacle seven times showing that it was a public testimony before the people that an innocent substitute had to die for a guilty victim a public testimony to everyone who passed that way knowed that they were coming under the blood of an innocent substitute for their sins thank you lord jesus and when she was burned and all her ashes was to be gathered up and put in a clean place watch outside the tabernacle in a clean place a clean place for it was the water of separation or the purification from sin now we read there in the scripture i want to just see this we'll back up one so it had to be taken to a clean place and it had to be picked up and gathered by a man that was clean with clean hands now we understand that that was eliezer or one that represented the ministry and so we find that in the day and the hour that we live in that everybody that's anybody it doesn't matter man woman married divorced this that the other everybody thinks that they're called to be a preacher i got a guy that i just talked to the other day because he went through i think it was wilkerson's uh teen challenge and they ordained him as a minister divorced man but i mean and you know there are several of those i've run across oh there was one i talked to the other day he did a correspondence course online and became an ordained minister but yet he smoked he cussed he he does drugs he's he does all these kind of things and i'm saying but what about the clean hands the one the other day living in full-blown adultery standing there preaching testifying doing all these things what are we talking about here we're talking about a ministry according to the word of god that will that will that will preach the gospel to us to lead us all into the perfection of saints to perfection clean hands friends we've got to understand that this ministry amen is dripping with blood blood of apostles blood of martyrs down to the ages brethren tells us your life must be worthy of the gospel not ministers that have been married deacons that have been married two three times living in all kinds of sin he said their lives are not worthy of the gospel nor are the people who support that are you with me this evening i'm not being mean i'm just trying to protect the people that they've got to be clean hands it's got to be offered in a cl i can take you thinking man's filter brother deals with this extensively i'm not making this up this is not brother dale's opinions not here to preach my opinions amen i heard it from a prophet who heard it from god and he said what a minister should marry and how he should be married and how what kind of wife that he should have and he said the unchanging god said so that's not my opinion and so here this this this red heifer what does it speak of it speaks of the bleeding word it speaks of the revealed message of the hour that's that that now is being expressed to the people and so when we preach these things we can't come with our own interpretation or our own opinions they have to be the word of god and that man has to stand there because he'll be judged at the end it's a frightful place to stand behind the desk and when we look at christ you see the penalty the only one whatever broke well ordinary thing i'll look at this one then when we look at christ the only one god himself made flesh god coming to the earth and took upon him the sin of us all and judgment oh i just i just want to read this judgment and wrath of almighty god was poured out upon his body and there it was riven at the cross that's the real judgment that's your judgment that's the only judgment that you will ever realize as a believer judgment first must begin at the house of the lord what happens at the house of the lord wherever that might be that's where you see yourself judged in christ that's the real judgment he tread the wine press of the wrath of god alone alone he walked the road alone he died and not no help from an angel from a man from his church from his mother from his brethren from his father forsaken by god man nature think about it oh brother brown tells a story of that little robin that little robin went down there saw him dying on the tree went down tried to pull the nails and bloodied his little breasts and that's how he become a red-breasted robin he said you leave my robins alone you boys forsaken he died alone to show us that even nature itself can't help us in the hour of death there's no friend no priest no pope no pastor it's death but there was one who took it for us so here brother brown now picks up the uh the uh the the brass serpent he said speaking of the brass servant says there are no life in the serpent it was absolutely crystallized he said that was the penalty he died until the earth got ashamed of itself he died until the stars got ashamed he suffered until the sun wouldn't shine he suffered till the moon turned off its lights he suffered till even the elements of the earth was so black and dark until it was midnight so dark you could feel it wasn't nothing no one's ever suffered like that or could suffer like that there's no mortal could could go through it but he suffered it and god laid upon him iniquity of us all and passed his judgments upon him and he treaded the wide press of the wrath of god alone with no help there was nothing to help him god placed the penalty everything was under that penalty and nothing could help him because we're all guilty there's no high priest could have come and helped him there was nothing could help him no pope no angel everything stood back and watched it that was the greatest moments was ever in the history of the world he died until there was not one drop of life left in him become like the brass serpent just a crystallized ornament hanging on the cross nobody can express that suffering like that but i i just when i read these things i think of the helplessness the suffering till even the nature itself the sun darkened in the middle of the day so dark you could feel it crystallized no life left in him hanging there the judgments of us all laid upon him but what happened that the life that was in christ when the blood cell broke there on calvary that that life then that zoe that we talked about this morning that zoe life then was then was released from god because god had held himself amen by his own power into the body of flesh called the lord jesus but when that price of perpetuation had been paid amen and redemptions uh uh uh a penalty had been paid that it released god from his own law then to come back according to the scripture and come back on the day of pentecost and that's why peter can say this is that amen that was prophesied by the prophet joel amen upon uh upon all flesh i'll pour out my spirit and so they were the recipients amen of the price that had been paid that the life that was in christ amen could come back on them the deity of god could now dwell in human beings and they could be the sons of god the bible said for he hath given us the power to be called the sons of god hallelujah and so now then we come to this place amen hanging there on the cross oh i like this but not only that but in his death he suffered a death like no one ever suffered never in man ever suffered with such a broken heart till his blood and water separated before his death now this is a twofold prophecy that had to be done because the scripture says amen that it was that there that it talks about how that it was in order for life to come that there had to be all three elements is that right water blood and spirit so here the three had to be separated from the body of christ so that you and i could come under new birth the new birth process had to be paid for in full by suffering and so he had to suffer to the fullness in order to pay for amen your new birth and so then he brought forth water amen justification blood sanctification to bring forth a birth amen the spirit of god the baptism coming back upon the believer this is and he actually preached this in the message perfection now we move down almost to the close here he said from the richest to the poorest from the most blessed to the most horrible suffering and then besides that went down into the very lowest depths of the lowest hell bearing our sins listen to what he says here and he got this end of the string or the end of the rope from the kink and there he lifted it up in resurrection and connected it with the other part of eternity and made a highway of holiness that the unclean could come on and be cleansed this is a striking statement to me first of all in the previous quote brother man makes this statement he says that he suffered like none other no man could suffer that where was brother brahm pulling this inspiration from that the bible says that his visage was marred more than any other man now i'm not here to be contradictory to the bible but there were men in the bible that were fed to dogs they were they were eaten by lions they were their visage was marred to the point of being the draught of the animals jesus and i'm not saying just but i'm just saying he was still intact not a bone was broken and so you say but but it said that his visage was marred more than any other man and so i'm here to tell you how because it wasn't just speaking of the physical visage visage actually goes beyond the physical form into the personality goes into the spirit realm visage is your expression your countenance are you with me it's your expression it's more than that so his expression or his visage his spirit was marred more than any other man how is that possible because sin of the world was laid upon him no other man ever bore that weight and that weight crushed him in the spirit realm he suffered more than any other man because he was more than a man so he could he could suffer more he could bear more he could be more he could take it all the bible says amen for they looked all through heaven and all through the earth and under the earth and above the earth to find one who was worthy amen to open the book and there was none worthy there was none worthy oh but then john began to weep and the angel said don't weep john for one has been found hallelujah the lion of the tribe of judah amen is worthy to take the book how was it because he was more than a man he suffered in every way like a man he was tempted in every way like a man but he was logos he was god he was he was everything and all things and he could carry atlas amen was a pimp squeak atlas couldn't carry anything amen but jesus christ bore the sins of the world the word worthiness there speaks of weight it speaks of a balance our sins had tipped the scales and there was no man that could tip them back to pay the price but when jesus stepped out amen because he was more than a man amen so he was worthy he could step on the scales tip the scales and then take the book amen and loose the seals and hand the book down to his messenger and the messenger handed it down to john and said john eat the book and so john ate the book and it was bitter in his belly sweet in his mouth he said now go prophesy again amen and so we come here from the richest to the poorest from the most blessed to the most horrible suffering and then besides that he went down into the lowest depths of the lowest hell bearing our sins and got the end of the string think about it friends that that eternity had been upset in the garden of eden because until then it was an eternal ring it couldn't be broken but then because of disobedience through the original sin through the fall in the garden the end of the eternal string fell down and went down into hell and it was hanging there and it had been hanging there for all of man's history but when christ comes he then descends down into the lowest hell bearing our sins and got the end of the string oh think about that because our eternal life rested upon that very act because if he did not accomplish that act then the eternal ring would have been broken and then there the scripture would have been broken and the they would all been lost and that's why that's why john was weeping if there was no man found worthy then we were all lost brother ram said amen so then what happened he come up out of death and hell and he stopped by paradise and he knocked on the door and adam opened the door and when he looked out he saw it he said oh look it's the one we had fellowship in the cool of the evening come on eve and he started up and she reached back and she shook abel and abel said oh it's the one that i saw amen it was my lamb that i offered and i died on the same rock hallelujah hey man he reached down and grabbed seth who rose up in the resurrection amen was a very type of resurrection seth reached back amen god noah noah reached back amen god abraham abraham reached back amen what did he do he brought up isaac and jacob amen and joseph and they were coming up one after us said lift up your gates you everlasting days hallelujah and let the king of glory come in and christ jesus was leading the way to bring the rope back and tie it back into eternity and now all that believe upon him having eternal life through christ who strengthens us amen and made a highway of holiness amen so we can all go to heaven my if it had not been for jesus where would i be i'm so glad that the lord brought me out maybe i'll stand up and sing this amen i've been singing since the lord brought me out i've been singing since the lord brought me out if it had not been for jesus oh where would i be i'm so glad that the lord brought me out y'all know it well i've been happy since the lord brought me out oh i've been happy

premeditatedly loved me hallelujah because he was able to premeditated predestinated amen my eternal salvation and i'm so glad of it he he saw me amen before the world ever begin amen amen praise the
