[30:44] service in a scripture and let's turn to
[30:46] book to the Book of
[30:48] Job chapter
[30:50] 12 I'm chapter chapter 12 and verse 12
[31:00] it says
[31:07] this with the
[31:09] ancient is
[31:12] wisdom and in the length of days
[31:16] understanding with him is
[31:19] wisdom and
[31:21] strength he that hath
[31:23] counsel and understanding
[31:28] the book is
[31:30] saying from this brother that of course
[31:34] that there is
[31:36] wisdom in
[31:39] years before we pray
[31:42] um got a message from brother Ron
[31:45] glidewell he says I'm in Lima Ohio this
[31:47] week and I ask for continued traveling
[31:50] mercies he's visiting family let's bow
[31:52] our heads Heavenly Father we pray first
[31:55] Lord for this request from our dear
[31:57] friend and brother brother Ron that you
[31:59] would guide them and protect them as
[32:01] they travel father may they draw closer
[32:04] to you on their on the road or on the
[32:06] flight or however they're traveling and
[32:09] father may they be a blessing wherever

[32:14] comforting hand would be upon them and
[32:16] that you would speak to them on this
[32:19] journey that they're on and father in
[32:21] our service tonight we pray
[32:24] that you would be here with us that you
[32:27] would give wisdom father and some of
[32:29] these questions and some of these
[32:31] answers and Lord that you would be
[32:33] glorified in all of these things in
[32:36] Jesus name we pray amen you can take
[32:39] your seats okay thank
[32:45] you as I as I read in the Book of
[32:49] Job there is wisdom in Years brother
[32:53] brandham when he talked about Elders in
[32:55] the church brother brandham made it very
[32:57] plain that that Elders in the
[32:59] church are those that are
[33:02] older those that have more
[33:05] experience and we look to the elders in
[33:08] our church for those experiences that
[33:12] they might counsel the
[33:14] younger my dad used to always tell me
[33:17] I'd always tell my Dad how to do things
[33:20] and I was always wrong like a 100% of
[33:23] the
[33:24] time and he he'd always and every time I
[33:27] was wrong which was very
[33:28] often he'd always say
[33:31] bud you know how many years it takes to
[33:34] get 50 years
[33:36] experience and I said yeah you've told
[33:39] me this before pop and he'd say 50
[33:44] years actually he'd say well it's about
[33:47] 50 years and that's when we go through
[33:52] life we get experiences that we simply
[33:55] don't have without years on us
[33:59] I know in in um the Book of
[34:02] Joshua it says
[34:04] that that um that the the
[34:08] elders in Israel I'm I'm sorry it's in
[34:12] judges that the people of Israel served
[34:18] God as long as Joshua was there and as
[34:23] long as those were with Joshua was there
[34:28] so we see that there is a change there
[34:30] was something in these Elders that they
[34:34] had an understanding they had a
[34:36] reverence for God that after that
[34:39] generation passed that that reverence as
[34:43] we see it just kind of faded away and I
[34:46] look at some of the elders that I've had
[34:49] the honor of
[34:50] knowing that were close with brother
[34:55] brandham all the brandham family brother
[34:57] Billy Paul especially my dad my
[35:00] grandfathers both of them brother sofman
[35:03] brother Hickerson brother Collins um
[35:07] brother
[35:07] Roberson brother
[35:10] um um Jim
[35:13] Maguire all of these brothers who I was
[35:15] very very close
[35:17] with there was something about them that
[35:19] was different and I know my wife always
[35:22] says she says you know someone that was
[35:24] around brother brandom they have a
[35:27] different look in their
[35:29] eyes and I really believe that that is
[35:32] because they came into contact with
[35:35] someone who was truly filled with the
[35:37] Holy Spirit someone that had that
[35:41] love that is
[35:46] portrayed and that when you meet someone
[35:49] that has that love it really changes
[35:50] your life because you see that this
[35:52] person really cares about
[35:55] me this person they're not there to
[35:59] promote themselves they're there be
[36:02] they're there they care about what I
[36:05] say and as I talked about when we were
[36:09] going through the Book of
[36:11] Job when we're counseling each
[36:14] other Sometimes the best counsel not
[36:17] sometimes I'd say most of the time the
[36:19] best counsel is just to
[36:22] listen just to listen and to
[36:25] love and then God will have his way in
[36:27] the situation and you'll build the trust
[36:30] of that person and with all Elders in
[36:33] the church I would encourage the
[36:35] elders
[36:37] to love the younger generation the ones
[36:41] that are coming
[36:42] in and to be there for them in any way
[36:45] that you can I talked about my mom last
[36:48] week on Mother's Day
[36:50] and she wasn't someone that was full of
[36:53] advice in fact she rarely corrected me
[36:56] she rarely rarely gave me advice in
[37:00] life but I think that she had the most
[37:03] impact of my life than anyone else in
[37:05] the world did because she loved me
[37:08] dearly and she set an example that was
[37:12] um was just beyond
[37:15] good so with our elders and I want to
[37:18] the way that I want to format this is
[37:20] you young people
[37:22] or um folks my age I grew my beard out
[37:26] so you could see how gray it is is so I
[37:28] think if you're older than me you're an
[37:30] elder and if you're younger than me
[37:32] you're a younger um but uh feel free to
[37:38] also ask
[37:40] questions if if a topic comes up and you
[37:43] want a little bit further explanation or
[37:45] you you want to know something else feel
[37:47] free to um to ask and and
[37:51] say I have this issue that I would like
[37:55] to know have you ever you have you ever
[37:57] experienced
[37:58] this um the first thing that I have
[38:01] written down and I also want um for the
[38:04] elders if if you just have something to
[38:06] say I want you I want to make sure that
[38:10] say
[38:11] it um that if you have some advice to
[38:14] give all of us I want you to give
[38:16] it um my first question and uh brother
[38:20] Jordan I'm going to turn on microphone
[38:21] one here I always say brother Jordan
[38:24] it's because I can't see the people
[38:26] usually behind the screen but I'll turn
[38:29] on microphone
[38:31] one
[38:33] and one of the big problems and sister
[38:35] Shirley I'm gonna ask you this question
[38:37] I'd like you to give an
[38:41] answer
[38:43] um
[38:46] yeah one of the problems
[38:48] that I think all of us
[38:51] have
[38:53] is when I get down on my knees to pray
[38:59] feel like there's so many voices going
[39:01] on in my head there's so many things
[39:03] that I'm thinking about and I'll get
[39:05] down and my mind will go this way and my
[39:07] mind will go that way so then I'll go up
[39:09] in the mountains and and I'll try to get
[39:12] quiet before the Lord to try to cut out
[39:14] all of the voices in in my head and it's
[39:17] so hard sister Shirley it's it's it's
[39:20] very difficult to get those voices and
[39:25] really get quiet before the Lord and I
[39:29] know that you're a prayer Warrior I know
[39:32] that you go before the Lord on behalf of
[39:35] many of us and I just like to ask you
[39:39] how do you quiet those voices When you
[39:45] pray I just praise him
[39:49] more when I get down and there's I'm not
[39:54] I'm hearing everything else to drown it
[39:56] out I just praise him that's
[40:01] scripture I Just Praise Him and then his
[40:03] presence comes near and then when his
[40:07] presence comes is that you go
[40:11] on
[40:16] yes sister Shirley um brother Lyle
[40:20] brother Ed and brother Arie can you come
[40:22] up here in the front um because I'd like
[40:25] also brother Jordan can handle the back
[40:28] um if you all could come up in the front
[40:30] brother brandom
[40:33] said one time he said when you go before
[40:37] the Lord in
[40:38] prayer he said you approach the Lord
[40:42] just like sister Shirley was saying and
[40:43] what you said is exactly scripture I
[40:45] believe it's in Isaiah that you go
[40:47] before the Lord you say holy holy unto
[40:50] the Lord holy holy unto the Lord and he
[40:54] starts to get closer and you're worship
[40:57] him and you're saying holy holy unto the
[41:00] Lord Lord of God Almighty holy holy unto
[41:04] the Lord and then you start to enter
[41:07] into his presence holy holy unto the
[41:09] Lord and then when you enter into his
[41:12] presence you say on behalf of my brother
[41:15] or on behalf of my
[41:18] sister anyone else on this question how
[41:21] do you get quiet before the Lord
[41:27] brother
[41:37] Jeremy sister surely said
[41:40] that God inhabits the Praises of his
[41:44] people that's the scripture
[41:48] promise and so you take that word and
[41:51] you put it in your mouth and
[41:53] you keep it before the Lord
[42:00] because God is his
[42:02] word and he loves loves to Fellowship
[42:06] around people that love his
[42:09] word and the second thought I had that I
[42:12] asked for
[42:14] Mike
[42:18] um what did you just say
[42:28] the scripture says serving others is
[42:32] looking heaven in the face and so when I
[42:35] pray I start praying for
[42:38] others and all those other
[42:43] thoughts become
[42:46] dim and as I bring bring your names
[42:50] before the Lord or just have someone my
[42:54] i i attended a meeting one time and I I
[42:59] cried I just cried for 45 minutes and
[43:03] all I could say was their
[43:05] name and then then the burden
[43:09] lifted and you know I trust the
[43:16] Lord heard heard whatever he had
[43:19] intended for me
[43:21] to kneel for
[43:29] oh my
[44:00] um one of the questions that I
[44:03] had on on my heart all of us and brother
[44:08] Lionel sister Lonnie I'm gonna I'm gonna
[44:10] maybe have you answer this first and
[44:12] then I think there's others that can
[44:14] answer this
[44:16] also when there's adversity in your life
[44:21] when you come into hard
[44:23] times and and it feels like
[44:28] you don't know what to
[44:30] do and it feels like maybe All Is
[44:34] Lost
[44:37] how what what do you do there's there's
[44:40] I know that you all have have overcome
[44:43] quite a bit of adversity in your
[44:45] life how do you do it where do you
[44:53] start I believe for me myself is that
[44:58] when that ad
[44:59] adversary it comes into my
[45:02] life the first thing that I think is he
[45:05] knows he knows exactly what it is before
[45:08] I even speak anything of my mouth of
[45:11] myself he knows what it
[45:13] is and many
[45:16] times when I've been in a situation like
[45:21] that I see that all that needs to happen
[45:24] is for me to just step up and just hold
[45:26] him at his word of what he promised
[45:29] me and when I hold him at his word and
[45:33] and I realize that if we stand there and
[45:34] we have 100% faith in our hearts then he
[45:38] is just to honor the word that that we
[45:41] believe
[45:43] um I had uh one of my sons was dying one
[45:47] day in the
[45:48] hospital and um it was to the point
[45:52] where these people that are in the
[45:53] medical profession profession they know
[45:55] that when the code team comes to the
[45:57] hospital room and they gather around the
[45:59] room that means that uh the patient is
[46:02] getting ready to do what they call
[46:03] Circle the Drain he's the patient's
[46:05] starting to dip out it's just going to
[46:08] be maybe
[46:09] minutes you know his heart rate is
[46:12] getting closer and
[46:13] closer everything's everything's
[46:16] sinking
[46:18] and my boy was just in his 20s there was
[46:21] no reason for him to be in in the
[46:23] condition that he was in he he was he
[46:26] was a firefighter and he fell sick
[46:28] nobody knew why he fell sick he was a
[46:31] healthy boy his entire life never had no
[46:33] medical condition and now he's in the
[46:35] hospital fighting for his life just just
[46:37] from fallowing what seemed like a
[46:39] fever and he got to the each day me and
[46:43] his mother would be at the hospital and
[46:45] the doctor would say you know we don't
[46:47] know whether he's going to make it
[46:48] overnight so stay close to your phone if
[46:50] you go home and we would we would peel
[46:53] out of the hospital at about
[46:55] maybe I think maybe 1:00 in the morning
[46:59] and then go back to the hospital at
[47:01] about maybe 4 or 5:00 in the morning and
[47:03] just sneak home and get a couple hours
[47:06] asleep and uh I got to hand it to the
[47:10] doctors for being honest with us when
[47:12] you go home stay close to the phone
[47:14] because he might not make it till the
[47:16] morning and we'd go home and we're tired
[47:19] cuz we've been up all day you know and
[47:23] it's just knowing in your heart that I
[47:27] know
[47:28] 100% that God is mindful of this
[47:30] situation he knows what's going on and I
[47:33] know he's not going to leave us here
[47:34] there's no reason this boy is too
[47:37] young and then uh after dealing with
[47:39] this for about a week you know my boy's
[47:42] lost a lot of weight he's he's uh in a
[47:45] hospital induced coma at this point he's
[47:49] innovated um he's on the uh on the
[47:53] ventilator I mean everything possibly
[47:56] happens happens he has blood clots
[47:57] everywhere he got chest tubes in the
[47:59] side of him every morning we went there
[48:02] you know it was worse and worse news you
[48:04] know his he's now has it it progressed
[48:07] to a heart condition like everything was
[48:11] just just completely against
[48:14] us and then one day I was I snuck out of
[48:18] his room and I'm sitting in the
[48:19] courtyard of the hospital in Lonnie's
[48:21] inside the the
[48:22] room and she uh calls me on the phone
[48:27] she says you got to get in here right
[48:28] now you know me and her are both in
[48:30] firefighters in the medical profession
[48:32] so to speak she says Hey the code came
[48:35] the code team just gathered at the door
[48:38] she goes you got to get in here now I
[48:40] said what are you talking about she go
[48:41] yeah they just came to the door they got
[48:43] the crash cart they got everything ready
[48:44] to go what do you mean go for what she
[48:47] goes listen the code team is at the
[48:50] door so I got up and I walked in and
[48:55] there was two chairs next to the bed
[48:58] and when I walked up to the uh to the
[49:00] door of the hos of his hospital
[49:03] room I seen first thing I seen coming
[49:05] down the hallway was that team and they
[49:07] were all putting their gloves on the
[49:08] rubber gloves and they were all getting
[49:10] their
[49:11] stuff and when I walked up they knew
[49:14] that I was a father none of them could
[49:15] look at me in the fa they all when I
[49:17] walked by they all kind of put their
[49:18] heads
[49:19] down and they wouldn't look at me so I
[49:23] said okay this is this is bad and I
[49:26] walked in and I seen Lonnie and she's
[49:28] sitting next to the
[49:30] bed and I walk up and I said hey you
[49:32] know what what do you mean the I said I
[49:34] see the co team's out there well she
[49:35] goes yeah she goes he's he's dipping she
[49:38] goes look at his heart rate look up at
[49:39] the monitor his heart rate stolic
[49:42] diastolic is coming together he's
[49:44] getting ready to do what they call some
[49:45] people know it as Flatline he's getting
[49:53] ready and I said no he's not
[49:59] she says what do you mean I said '
[50:03] listen I said we would worship a mighty
[50:12] God I said there's no reason that he
[50:14] should have even been here I said we
[50:16] don't know what this is but I believe
[50:18] that if we take God at his word even
[50:20] though we're looking right now at
[50:25] death comeing on this boy right now it
[50:27] does not
[50:29] matter and she grabbed my hand and she
[50:32] says L know she goes we're in this
[50:34] business he's getting ready to
[50:37] die she goes and we're sitting right
[50:39] here next to the bed like if we're in
[50:40] the front seat watching this thing
[50:42] getting ready to unfold in front of us
[50:45] and they had respect for us enough cuz
[50:47] you know we certified a little bit so
[50:49] they let us stay there you know usually
[50:51] they'll ask the family members to leave
[50:52] the room they let us stay there
[50:57] she says we're about to witness this
[50:59] right in front of us right now and I
[51:01] seen them all gathering around you know
[51:04] coming closer to his bed just waiting
[51:06] waiting on the monitors to
[51:08] show and then I turned to her and it's
[51:11] real strange I didn't even call her my
[51:12] wife orani I said woman I turned to her
[51:16] look right right in the face said woman
[51:18] where is your
[51:25] faith and that was it as the code team
[51:28] was looking at the monitors went into
[51:31] prayer I said father do not let this boy
[51:35] died do not even let him live give him a
[51:38] chance that he knows you that's what I
[51:40] want I
[51:42] want I want him to know
[51:49] you give him a chance to come out of
[51:52] this that he could know
[51:55] you started praying praying for him and
[51:59] I could for some reason some way I could
[52:01] Envision the way almost like a movie
[52:04] when a when the camera in the movie pans
[52:07] over the ocean and it drops down to the
[52:09] level of the ocean it starts going over
[52:11] the ocean I
[52:12] seen I seen him from his foot feet all
[52:15] the way to his head like I was paning
[52:17] over his body like it was the ocean all
[52:18] the way to his head and as I was praying
[52:21] all of a sudden I felt I felt a
[52:23] connection between me and him and and
[52:26] and up above was like a strike of
[52:29] lightning like a connection somehow
[52:31] there was a connection between me him
[52:34] and
[52:36] God just like that like a lightning
[52:39] strike and when that connection came
[52:43] on that nurse that was looking at the
[52:45] monitor with the code team right there
[52:47] she looked up and said these exact words
[52:49] she looked at that monitor and she says
[52:51] oh oh oh wow wow and she literally
[52:56] jumped about 3 ft away from the
[52:58] monitor she goes wow and then she came
[53:01] up looked at the monitor she went behind
[53:04] it looked at all the cords made sure the
[53:05] cords were still connected and then she
[53:08] said these words okay she goes okay okay
[53:12] then she turned to the Cod team went up
[53:14] and talked to him and the greatest thing
[53:16] that I've ever seen in my life was the
[53:18] code team taking off their gloves and
[53:20] their gowns and masks and throwing them
[53:22] in the bin and rolling that crash card
[53:24] away from that room
[53:28] but see that
[53:29] day I I took God at his word that's what
[53:33] it was he was mindful of the situation
[53:35] he know the
[53:37] situation
[53:39] but God wants somebody to stand on this
[53:42] Earth and appreciate the words that he
[53:45] gave to them and he wants them to stand
[53:47] and take him at his at his word and
[53:49] stand strong on that word that's the way
[53:52] the King David did when he was a was he
[53:55] was a young Shepherd boy no nobody else
[53:56] went out to face that Philistine Goliath
[54:00] King David did cuz he stood up and said
[54:02] hey is somebody going to take God at his
[54:04] word they going to let this Blasphemous
[54:06] Philistine talk about the armies of the
[54:08] Living God or is somebody going to step
[54:10] up and take God at his word see and
[54:13] that's the way that in my life when it's
[54:15] adversary like that I've
[54:18] realized
[54:20] um you know there's people that get
[54:22] involved in many things you know in
[54:23] situations like that they'll go and
[54:25] they'll go had a candle somewhere
[54:27] they'll go to a somewhere to some uh
[54:30] maybe to a cathedral or a church or a
[54:32] sanctuary they'll do that but for me
[54:33] I've always had to go somewhere and and
[54:36] just take God at his word just 100% at
[54:40] his word and then just go and stand on
[54:42] that word and speak the word and then
[54:45] that's when you'll see that thing like
[54:47] lightning within an instant just change
[54:49] everything
[54:51] around that boy came out of it when he
[54:54] came out of it he went in that hospital
[54:56] hospit about 220 lbs came out at about
[54:59] 130 first thing we did is went and found
[55:01] some water and this was based on his
[55:04] request he wanted to be
[55:08] [Applause]
[55:15] baptized
[55:19] amen you know we come to church we hear
[55:23] a sermon we worship we
[55:27] pray and when
[55:29] times like that hit
[55:33] us that is the time to call
[55:36] upon the name of the
[55:39] Lord and we can say where is your
[55:43] faith and I can say to myself where is
[55:46] my
[55:47] faith brother Ed want you to come up and
[55:51] um I know that you've gone through
[55:54] adversity you you were um injured as a
[55:59] young man and and you've had to
[56:03] overcome quite a bit so brother Ed if
[56:06] you could tell us how you overcame these
[56:09] things that you
[56:15] overcome now you're putting me on the
[56:19] spot you want me to
[56:23] okay I can see you
[56:28] overcome in my whole life um I was inj
[56:31] injured playing football at a rather
[56:33] young
[56:34] age and because of that I've gone
[56:37] through a great deal in my life uh
[56:40] physically but also at the same time um
[56:44] it left some extremely deep scars
[56:47] within and I
[56:49] just um lived life you know I was
[56:53] rejected uh I was made fun of because
[56:56] mentality then was totally different as
[56:59] it is for someone with with a
[57:01] handicap but that wasn't so much uh
[57:05] because be because of that I really felt
[57:09] that God had his hand on me and uh who
[57:13] knows where I would have been had I not
[57:15] gone through that in my
[57:17] life but part of the one of the hardest
[57:20] things
[57:21] was I'll go back um 2005 our son was
[57:25] getting ready to deploy go to
[57:28] war and he was
[57:31] activated told to stand down reactivate
[57:34] told to stand down this went on through
[57:36] probably six seven months of
[57:40] 2005 and I was I was talking to a
[57:42] brother who used to come here to the
[57:46] church and I was pouring my heart out to
[57:49] the brother and I got to talking you I
[57:51] sort of felt it was unfair I mean you
[57:53] know it was stressful uh knowing that
[57:55] just your loved one's going to go to war
[58:01] um but as I was talking to this
[58:04] brother you know I'm naturally I'm a dad
[58:07] I I just want to protect my
[58:10] children and I was
[58:13] taught expressing these desires and then
[58:16] I realized that if I as a natural father
[58:19] want to protect my children how much
[58:22] more does our heavenly father want to do
[58:25] something and I had the weight of the
[58:27] whole world as I was
[58:29] talking and as I mentioned that the
[58:32] Lord would do even more so the whole
[58:35] weight just lifted I was in my truck and
[58:38] that's where I spend a lot of my time is
[58:40] in my truck driving that's where I have
[58:43] my quiet
[58:45] time I I get in my truck I commit my day
[58:49] to the
[58:51] Lord and then I I don't even many times
[58:55] I don't even turn the radio on but I
[58:58] just start thinking about the Lord and
[59:00] inviting the Lord into into my
[59:04] truck and yes I I work 45 minutes from
[59:08] home
[59:11] but often the Lord the sweet presence of
[59:14] the Lord will just fill the fill the
[59:16] truck and I know that he's there and
[59:20] I'll start singing you know um a song
[59:23] Hallelujah is probably one of the
[59:25] favorite because when I when I sing that
[59:28] or hum that I feel the presence of the
[59:30] Lord come
[59:32] down and it's I'm trying to enter into
[59:36] an atmosphere of worship and that's why
[59:38] when we sing here at
[59:41] church the songs we sing whether it's
[59:43] brother Josiah or brother Aaron Or
[59:45] whoever may be leading songs it's a
[59:48] whole
[59:49] atmosphere that the presence of the Lord
[59:51] will come down and
[59:58] I'll sit there and I'll and I'll just
[1:00:00] lay my petitions before him and commit
[1:00:02] my day before him and usually you know
[1:00:04] no matter how hard the day is at the end
[1:00:06] of the day I go wow I got all this
[1:00:08] done and I'm sort of surprised because
[1:00:12] sometimes it's uh extremely
[1:00:14] stressful
[1:00:18] but not long ago you know my wife and I
[1:00:34] sorry we have gone through some of the
[1:00:36] darkest times in our
[1:00:42] life don't know why but it's not for me
[1:00:46] to question but as I was talking to this
[1:00:49] brother uh in ' 05 I realized it doesn't
[1:00:53] make a difference if my son came home in
[1:00:55] a body bag and that's hard to to say as
[1:00:59] a parent if my son comes home in a body
[1:01:02] bag God was in control it's okay God's
[1:01:06] in control so when we went through these
[1:01:10] situations here a few years ago it was
[1:01:13] the darkest time of our life I would
[1:01:16] have much rather had gone through what I
[1:01:19] went through as a kid than to go through
[1:01:21] what we went through and I won't go into
[1:01:24] details it does it does doesn't make a
[1:01:26] difference but God was so merciful to
[1:01:32] us and in The Darkest Hours I knew God
[1:01:36] was in control God was no matter what
[1:01:40] happened God was in
[1:01:42] control and every day God gave us a
[1:01:46] little
[1:01:47] nugget didn't give us a big plate of of
[1:01:50] blessings but he gave us a little nugget
[1:01:51] say it's okay I've got the situation
[1:01:54] under control it's going to be
[1:01:57] okay and that's what got us through when
[1:01:59] I was
[1:02:01] down sister Kathy was was strong most of
[1:02:05] the time she was the one having the
[1:02:08] hardest time and I was the stronger one
[1:02:10] but every day didn't make a difference
[1:02:12] it was coming to church seeing a brother
[1:02:15] getting a message hey how you doing or
[1:02:19] just listening to a a sermon from
[1:02:22] whoever God gave us a little nugget and
[1:02:26] it uh it got us through amen and because
[1:02:30] of that I can
[1:02:34] stand and I can rest assured that no
[1:02:37] matter what life throws at us it's
[1:02:41] okay God when you go through
[1:02:44] ADV adversity when you go through your
[1:02:47] tests when you go through your
[1:02:50] trials God is forming your
[1:02:53] character I heard a minister
[1:02:56] talk about a ship that they were on a
[1:02:58] cruise and they hit a massive storm and
[1:03:02] this massive cruise ship was tossed
[1:03:05] about and the lady called the captain
[1:03:08] and the C Captain didn't answer it was
[1:03:10] the first officer of the called back say
[1:03:12] you know it's okay this ship was built
[1:03:16] for this
[1:03:17] storm and I took that is that as we as
[1:03:21] we as Christians when we go through
[1:03:23] things and
[1:03:24] we you God doesn't always hit us with a
[1:03:28] massive uh trial he'll he'll let little
[1:03:30] things hit us and see how we
[1:03:34] react and then we grow and we become
[1:03:36] stronger and then a little later we get
[1:03:40] hit with something a little bigger and
[1:03:42] then we we learn from it and then we we
[1:03:46] go we keep
[1:03:47] growing and my hope and my my confidence
[1:03:51] is in the word of God he's never left us
[1:03:55] he's he's not left either one of you he
[1:03:58] won't leave
[1:04:01] you just keep your eyes focused on the
[1:04:04] cross
[1:04:05] am you know we sang the song brother
[1:04:09] Josiah had through it
[1:04:11] all but because of Christ because of his
[1:04:16] word no matter what we go through it's
[1:04:19] okay God's in control it doesn't make a
[1:04:22] difference if I die or if I live I'm a
[1:04:26] I'm a winner either way amen
[1:04:29] so keep pressing on because we're
[1:04:33] getting closer to going home and as we
[1:04:37] get closer it's going to be harder but
[1:04:39] God's
[1:04:44] faithful brother Ed I don't know if he
[1:04:46] was quoting it but the Apostle Paul was
[1:04:49] probably really
[1:04:52] down and he said for me to live
[1:04:56] live is Christ if I'm going to live I'm
[1:04:59] going to live for Christ and if I die
[1:05:02] it's my
[1:05:04] gain um I wanted to uh sister
[1:05:08] Olivia where is Olivia where'd she go
[1:05:11] are do you have a song okay why don't
[1:05:13] you make ready um
[1:05:17] so um yeah if if you can make ready
[1:05:19] right now I'd like to just give a little
[1:05:23] advice as as as a dad
[1:05:27] and as some of the time brother Ed said
[1:05:29] his quiet time was in his his
[1:05:32] truck I had a job when I was a young man
[1:05:36] in my early 20s that I was able to drive
[1:05:39] a
[1:05:40] lot and what I would do when I was
[1:05:43] driving is I always had a tape of
[1:05:46] brother Brandon
[1:05:48] playing and that time that I spent
[1:05:52] listening to those sermons what it did
[1:05:55] is it buil built a foundation in me not
[1:05:57] only spiritually and it did it mold of
[1:05:59] my character but it also gave me the
[1:06:02] knowledge of what brother brandham said
[1:06:06] so when someone comes against what he
[1:06:09] said or someone attacks him and and
[1:06:13] attacks his character I have listened to
[1:06:16] every single one of them from 1947 to
[1:06:19] 1965 I don't remember what's on all of
[1:06:22] them but I have listened to everyone and
[1:06:25] I can give an answer because I have that
[1:06:29] experience and I would encourage you
[1:06:31] young
[1:06:32] people don't waste time when you have
[1:06:36] some time listen to those sermons I
[1:06:40] promise you they'll do you good they'll
[1:06:42] build a foundation in you
[1:06:51] [Music]

[1:07:11] listen I don't want to see
[1:07:14] anymore give me a
[1:07:17] vision that you could move this heart to
[1:07:22] be set
[1:07:24] apart our I don't need to
[1:07:27] recognize the man in the
[1:07:30] mirror and I don't want to trade your
[1:07:33] plan for something
[1:07:36] familiar I can't waste a
[1:07:39] day and I can't stay the same I want to
[1:07:44] be

[1:08:18] in a
[1:08:19] pattern and I don't want to gain this
[1:08:22] world but lose what matters

[1:08:29] up everything because I want to
[1:08:33] be I want to be
[1:08:36] Chang till all of me is

[1:09:20] to be different

[1:10:04] me
[1:10:07] amen um I have a
[1:10:10] question now and uh this one sister
[1:10:14] Rachel I'm gonna ask maybe you and
[1:10:15] brother Aaron about this this next
[1:10:19] question you raised a large family you
[1:10:22] raised six
[1:10:23] daughters I know
[1:10:26] it was hard I I have two kids and it was
[1:10:30] really hard for us to make end meet
[1:10:35] financially how'd you do
[1:10:37] it you got through it I'm GNA both of
[1:10:41] you need to answer brother Aon you're
[1:10:43] closer so I'm goingon to have you answer
[1:10:45] then you have some time to think of your
[1:10:47] answer sister
[1:10:50] Rachel God always
[1:10:53] provides yes and if you don't compare
[1:10:56] yourself to
[1:10:58] others sometimes you got to be careful
[1:11:00] with that how come they have this and
[1:11:03] how come they
[1:11:05] don't I've shared this testimony with
[1:11:08] you before how When We Were Young we
[1:11:11] always wanted to go to our friend's
[1:11:12] house because they had a TV and we
[1:11:15] wanted to see
[1:11:17] cartoons and they always wanted to be at
[1:11:19] our
[1:11:20] house and one day I convinced him that
[1:11:24] we could go to their house house and
[1:11:26] right about the time that we sat down to
[1:11:28] watch the cartoons a little brother come
[1:11:31] running
[1:11:32] out said get out of here get out of here
[1:11:34] let's get out of here let's run and so
[1:11:36] my friend begins to run so we ran
[1:11:38] too and I said Mom and Dad didn't get
[1:11:41] along well and they were always getting
[1:11:43] into fights and they would attack each
[1:11:46] other with whatever it was and that's
[1:11:48] why they wanted to be at our
[1:11:50] house and something that we did we may
[1:11:53] not have had the newest car and in fact
[1:11:56] the girls always remember the
[1:11:58] van that had a hole in the
[1:12:02] muffler and they would know we were
[1:12:04] coming home and then they would clean
[1:12:06] the house cuz Mom and Dad were almost
[1:12:08] home they heard you that far away yes
[1:12:11] until we got it fixed but but God always
[1:12:15] provided um and and we may do with what
[1:12:19] we had and God never missed you know
[1:12:21] having the family with you
[1:12:23] though you know if if if we hadn't had
[1:12:26] my parents and her parents life would
[1:12:28] have been
[1:12:29] different but I'll say this about
[1:12:32] her uh the S tell as you know my wife's
[1:12:35] family and some of the older families
[1:12:37] there my mother-in-law died young from
[1:12:41] cancer and her being the eldest of the
[1:12:43] girls she became a mom to her younger
[1:12:47] sisters so by the time we got married
[1:12:49] she had a lot more experience in raising
[1:12:51] children so she raised this one
[1:12:54] too and she knew how to make things work
[1:12:57] and it's I mentioned this to you the
[1:13:01] other day about my daughter Sarah and we
[1:13:04] did something with the children and if
[1:13:06] they did misbehave in
[1:13:08] church we told them when they got home
[1:13:10] they would pay the
[1:13:11] price so we told him if you um if when
[1:13:15] we get home you're going to get a
[1:13:17] spanking it just seems like spanking
[1:13:19] solved everything or we thought and if
[1:13:22] you take the spanking then you get to
[1:13:24] have some kind of of of
[1:13:26] treat if you chose not to get the
[1:13:28] spanking you had to go to directly to
[1:13:31] bed and Sarah doesn't let me forget this
[1:13:36] that I spanked her and then I made her
[1:13:37] go to
[1:13:38] bed and she still brings those things
[1:13:41] back and says daddy you didn't keep your
[1:13:44] word so I was driving home one day with
[1:13:48] her and I said say something tell me
[1:13:51] something that you appreciated about
[1:13:53] your mom and your dad
[1:13:56] and she stopped for a minute she looks
[1:13:57] at me that you were consistent if you
[1:14:00] said no mama said no if you said yes
[1:14:04] Mama Said Yes we knew we would get
[1:14:06] treated
[1:14:08] consistently and um my wife went through
[1:14:12] a real hard
[1:14:13] time and I don't know if she would share
[1:14:15] that or not but she was still Mama to
[1:14:19] them
[1:14:23] [Applause]
[1:14:28] my family it was don't ask Dad because
[1:14:30] it's always
[1:14:32] no maybe Mom can convince
[1:14:35] dad and no my kids didn't get a treat
[1:14:38] after they got a
[1:14:40] spanking I like that
[1:14:47] part I think Aaron pretty much covered
[1:14:51] it
[1:14:52] um I don't know my girls were mellow
[1:14:55] um they didn't give us a whole lot of
[1:14:58] problems
[1:15:00] um prayer we had um before the girls
[1:15:05] would go to school we would you know
[1:15:07] gather around and we'd pray and
[1:15:10] sometimes we'd give the neighbor kids
[1:15:11] little rights I mean rights to school so
[1:15:13] they would come and they would pray with
[1:15:15] us
[1:15:16] too and we always read the Bible you
[1:15:18] know together and I mean it just lots of
[1:15:23] hand-me-downs sometimes S I prayed over
[1:15:26] the soup because there was only one
[1:15:28] meatball and
[1:15:30] then this really happened um everybody
[1:15:34] got a meatball in their soup and I'm
[1:15:37] like the Lord multiplied it
[1:15:42] somehow
[1:15:44] um just it was the Lord honestly just
[1:15:49] and I did want to say about
[1:15:53] communication keep the
[1:15:55] communication with your daughters with
[1:15:58] your sons with each other open there's
[1:16:02] times one time one of my girls and I
[1:16:05] couldn't agree and she would say
[1:16:08] something and I misunderstood it and we
[1:16:11] were trying
[1:16:14] to understand each other we went in
[1:16:17] circles we were frustrated we got angry
[1:16:19] we but keep talking keep talking to one
[1:16:23] another
[1:16:25] don't you know and and whatever question
[1:16:30] your child comes to you with your
[1:16:32] daughters my daughters are
[1:16:35] grown um when they were little I would
[1:16:38] be like how dare you be thinking
[1:16:41] that you know and later I learned
[1:16:45] just
[1:16:47] listen if you don't understand it pray
[1:16:50] about it and just keep that
[1:16:53] communication open because they need to
[1:16:55] talk to somebody you know and if you
[1:16:58] don't talk to them and listen to them
[1:17:02] and you might think oh it's just such a
[1:17:04] little thing to them it's a big thing if
[1:17:07] it's on their heart and they're bringing
[1:17:09] it to you listen pray about it um talk
[1:17:14] to them about it you know so
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:25] that was loaded with
[1:17:27] wisdom to keep that communication open
[1:17:32] to pray over things you you see how the
[1:17:36] Holy Spirit was in the G home growing up
[1:17:40] and how he he provided and multiplied
[1:17:44] the food and it's blessing to me that
[1:17:50] what means the most to me is that you
[1:17:51] only had one meatball and which just
[1:17:55] still you still put your trust in the
[1:17:57] Lord um and he took care of us like he
[1:18:00] always does we we hear these hard times
[1:18:02] that these families have had but that's
[1:18:05] the times that we grow closer to the
[1:18:08] Lord so those hard times are actually
[1:18:09] blessings to us and I hope you young
[1:18:12] people are listening because you're
[1:18:15] going to go through hard times I promise
[1:18:17] you especially when your kids get to be
[1:18:20] teenagers they're um they lose their
[1:18:23] minds
[1:18:25] you did um I wanted to
[1:18:28] ask um sister baggot about so she was
[1:18:34] she was involved we we've
[1:18:37] heard um the rumors and the stories
[1:18:40] about the the Prescot trailer park and
[1:18:43] and how hard that was what a difficult
[1:18:45] situation that
[1:18:47] was Sister Roberto was
[1:18:50] 16 when she came out of that trailer
[1:18:53] park
[1:18:55] and that's a very difficult situation
[1:18:58] and you think about how many people
[1:19:01] here in going through what they went
[1:19:06] through how many people would have just
[1:19:09] left and said I'm sick of it I'm tired
[1:19:13] of it I'm going to live my
[1:19:15] life but this family you stayed with it
[1:19:20] you stayed with the message and sister
[1:19:23] Berta as a 16-year-old girl how did you
[1:19:26] make that decision that you're going to
[1:19:28] stay
[1:19:30] with this
[1:19:32] gospel that you had learned as a young
[1:19:43] girl
[1:19:46] um well I have to say it's God's
[1:19:52] grace I had marvelous
[1:19:56] grandparents marvelous
[1:19:59] parents I
[1:20:02] feel parents have been gone
[1:20:06] five or six years and two
[1:20:10] years but
[1:20:13] um God spoiled me was good
[1:20:18] family and
[1:20:21] um I know I'm always um admire
[1:20:25] people that serve God and they're the
[1:20:28] only ones serving God in their
[1:20:31] family because I
[1:20:34] had I had a tremendous amount
[1:20:40] of support let's put it that way
[1:20:46] um but I mean we all have to make our
[1:20:49] decision ourselves
[1:20:52] too and um
[1:20:55] brother brandham came to the camp
[1:20:58] several
[1:20:59] times he preached a couple of sermons
[1:21:03] there I was there from 3 years old to 16
[1:21:07] that's where I was
[1:21:08] raised we were raised to serve one
[1:21:11] another to love one
[1:21:15] another um there was
[1:21:18] things that weren't right but I was only
[1:21:22] 16 and I don't know all the
[1:21:26] things there I just
[1:21:30] know
[1:21:35] that God loved us then and he loves us
[1:21:38] now and all I can say is that he kept us
[1:21:43] I my my daddy had a nervous
[1:21:46] breakdown when all of that
[1:21:48] happened that was very hard on
[1:21:52] me but then God gave me a
[1:21:57] husband that loved me and loved me
[1:22:01] unconditionally and I've always been
[1:22:03] very
[1:22:04] grateful because
[1:22:07] when I went right from my daddy to my
[1:22:10] husband because I was only
[1:22:13] 17 and
[1:22:17] um I just but I do know
[1:22:22] that when you get ser carry us with God
[1:22:26] I remember it and it's hard because
[1:22:29] you're
[1:22:31] told growing up
[1:22:34] that we're the bride of
[1:22:36] Christ but you're sort of kept in there
[1:22:42] that you're the only one we're the only
[1:22:45] ones and
[1:22:49] uh but
[1:22:51] yet I remember I was um
[1:22:55] my dad was
[1:22:56] sick and my I mean crazy
[1:23:01] sick and
[1:23:05] um and I remember getting down I don't
[1:23:09] know what it is with me and
[1:23:11] bathrooms but I have had a lot of
[1:23:15] prayers answered that I've prayed in a
[1:23:18] bathroom and I I'll never forget I was
[1:23:22] at my
[1:23:23] aunties and and um everything was crazy
[1:23:27] cuz everything was blowing up you're
[1:23:30] like everybody's leaving
[1:23:33] and we we did keep the love between us
[1:23:38] that's one thing I can say brother
[1:23:41] brandham said we had a love there that
[1:23:43] was a good thing and those people
[1:23:48] there it's
[1:23:50] been what I'm 65 and I was 16 so it's
[1:23:54] been lots of years ago and those people
[1:23:56] are
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:23:59] still like
[1:24:02] family just absolutely could trust him
[1:24:06] with
[1:24:07] whatever and um anyway I just got
[1:24:12] down because I wasn't sure there was a
[1:24:15] God with all this going
[1:24:18] on things you thought was all fine and
[1:24:22] dandy was wasn't fine and dandy
[1:24:25] anymore and uh I just remembered getting
[1:24:29] down and it wasn't really like I was
[1:24:32] praying for something but I just I told
[1:24:35] God I said if you're there if you're if
[1:24:40] you're God and you're looking we need
[1:24:44] help you know I just really got down and
[1:24:47] cried and prayed God we need you right
[1:24:50] now
[1:24:52] and and
[1:24:55] he it it wasn't like it all got over in
[1:24:59] a day but we we made it and um and just
[1:25:06] totally by his grace my dad was sick for
[1:25:08] four
[1:25:10] years and
[1:25:13] um just over and over I mean my grand my
[1:25:17] grandmother you know she was the one
[1:25:20] that brother Brandon prayed
[1:25:22] for and she
[1:25:25] was healed and um just her
[1:25:30] life I now see
[1:25:33] that the things that brother Brown told
[1:25:37] her have been encouragement to the
[1:25:40] children and the
[1:25:42] grandchildren and
[1:25:47] um I don't know I just feel like um it's
[1:25:51] Grace Grace and Mercy uh
[1:25:55] nothing surely that I haven't have done
[1:25:59] for
[1:26:00] sure and just God has been very good to
[1:26:03] me very good to my
[1:26:06] family blessed this with the children
[1:26:09] and
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:12] grandchildren and
[1:26:14] um I just feel like sometimes he's been
[1:26:18] a little bit too good to
[1:26:20] me
[1:26:22] but I just give him all the praise and
[1:26:25] honor because when you're going through
[1:26:30] things you you just have to sort of grab
[1:26:34] the boots and put them on and March and
[1:26:38] you don't really know what's around the
[1:26:40] next
[1:26:41] corner but then when you come through
[1:26:44] hindsight's always you can see the hand
[1:26:47] of God but when you're going through
[1:26:49] something you have
[1:26:51] to yeah and to trust God that that's
[1:26:55] that's to truly trust God that's I think
[1:26:59] a
[1:27:01] learned uh uh something you learn
[1:27:04] through life is to tr absolutely trust
[1:27:07] God because he's all you've got some
[1:27:11] times
[1:27:16] do
[1:27:23] amen sister an can I
[1:27:28] ask for some of our our young sisters
[1:27:31] and young brothers too I could ask my
[1:27:34] wife or um or you how do you how do you
[1:27:37] stay with it and coming through the
[1:27:42] years can
[1:27:45] I yeah I'm G to come back to sister
[1:27:48] an and I'm going to go over to my wife
[1:27:55] sweetheart as a young lady you always
[1:27:58] kept your
[1:28:01] testimony until you got married no I'm
[1:28:03] just
[1:28:05] kidding I'm
[1:28:08] kidding sweetheart how'd you do
[1:28:16] it what advice do you have for the young
[1:28:22] sisters I think that the thing I would
[1:28:25] probably say is that Jesus never under
[1:28:28] delivers and it is hard sometimes when
[1:28:32] you're walking through this life you
[1:28:33] feel alone and you you're put to the
[1:28:37] test sometimes just just being different
[1:28:40] and having moral standards that the
[1:28:42] world doesn't always have um and so
[1:28:45] sometimes you feel a little bit alone
[1:28:47] but there's something in you that that
[1:28:49] you just want to be right with God and
[1:28:53] that is him you know that's that part of
[1:28:55] him that's in you and it those decisions
[1:28:59] that you're made making are really him
[1:29:02] you know just being within you and and
[1:29:06] when you do the right thing and and you
[1:29:08] feel right and you're you're conscious
[1:29:10] is good with the Lord you you look back
[1:29:12] in your life and you realize that it was
[1:29:14] such a blessing to be different it was a
[1:29:17] blessing for all of the the you know
[1:29:20] being a little bit you know it kept me
[1:29:23] from trouble it kept me from being I
[1:29:26] don't want to say in the cool group but
[1:29:28] it kind of keeps people they have enough
[1:29:30] respect for you that they don't invite
[1:29:32] you to things and it keeps you out of
[1:29:34] trouble and I believe that when you just
[1:29:38] surrender to the Lord and you realize
[1:29:40] that he's really what I want the Lord he
[1:29:44] doesn't it's not like you're settling
[1:29:46] for anything he he gives you the best he
[1:29:48] gives you better than you could ever
[1:29:50] hope and you look back at your life and
[1:29:52] you think wow Lord you know just you
[1:29:55] know never under
[1:30:05] deliver she's been a blessing to
[1:30:08] me and uh I noce Stephanie she has she's
[1:30:12] always she always kept her
[1:30:14] testimony she walked with her head above
[1:30:18] all of the mess that was around us all
[1:30:21] and and I remember Sister Jessica you
[1:30:23] were you're kind of a a lot quite a bit
[1:30:26] younger not too much younger but quite
[1:30:28] younger and and
[1:30:30] Stephanie and um a couple a couple of
[1:30:33] the Gara girls you all were younger too
[1:30:35] but very
[1:30:38] few of our
[1:30:40] group really stayed with
[1:30:43] it and but there but the ones that did
[1:30:49] they are
[1:30:50] pillars for others and and they can say
[1:30:53] here here's how we did it here's how we
[1:30:56] overcame sister an okay
[1:31:02] no but there is there is an overcoming
[1:31:05] you know in each Church age it always
[1:31:08] addresses it it doesn't address IT
[1:31:10] addresses to the angel but it always
[1:31:12] mentions to him that
[1:31:13] overcomes and that's each of us that
[1:31:16] that we can overcome these adversities
[1:31:18] that we have is there anyone else as far
[1:31:20] as that
[1:31:22] subject who
[1:31:25] Hope's pointing at
[1:31:27] somebody sister Heather
[1:31:37] okay to me the answer to everything is
[1:31:40] the Lord
[1:31:41] Jesus I came to the message because I
[1:31:43] love the Lord
[1:31:45] Jesus everything is about him
[1:31:49] am and so I love him
[1:31:54] too and he's been kind he's always been
[1:31:58] there for me and his word is true and uh
[1:32:02] I just say whatever you're going through
[1:32:05] Jesus is your
[1:32:07] answer because he's been mine and he is
[1:32:13] mine amen that's
[1:32:18] wisdom and he's never will never stop
[1:32:21] being the
[1:32:22] answer he's a same yesterday and today
[1:32:26] and forever sister Jessica if you can
[1:32:28] make ready for your
[1:32:31] song um
[1:32:33] I we talked about a little bit
[1:32:36] about the trailer park and and all of us
[1:32:40] know brother John you and I we've kind
[1:32:43] of come through some things and we can
[1:32:46] give our hearts to the Lord and we can
[1:32:48] want to serve the
[1:32:50] Lord but sometimes it go
[1:32:54] goes in a direction that God doesn't
[1:32:56] want it to go you know what I'm talking
[1:32:59] about and and we we have a sincere heart
[1:33:03] but we may Veer from the
[1:33:05] truth into what the Bible calls fables
[1:33:09] or maybe into things that don't exactly
[1:33:14] line up with the word and then what
[1:33:17] happens
[1:33:18] is then we as I was preaching on this
[1:33:21] morning then we are are doing these
[1:33:24] things now for ourselves even though
[1:33:26] it's
[1:33:27] religion now it's a it's about
[1:33:31] ourselves
[1:33:33] and Jesus said he says they said well
[1:33:38] these people that you're hanging out
[1:33:40] with they're worldly they're their wine
[1:33:42] bibbers and their prostitutes and their
[1:33:44] tax collectors and and you're with all
[1:33:46] these people and we are with all of
[1:33:49] these holy people and Jesus said that I
[1:33:53] have
[1:33:55] desired um mercy and not
[1:34:01] sacrifice brother L how do we know maybe
[1:34:06] when we get off of the track and we get
[1:34:09] into something that maybe is not the
[1:34:12] Lord's will even though we are just as
[1:34:13] sincere as anywhere anyone
[1:34:16] else how do we get
[1:34:18] off and then how do we get back
[1:34:24] you may be standing there for a
[1:34:31] while I've been on both sides of that
[1:34:35] fence um and I pray that I'm on the
[1:34:39] correct side of the fence now um we
[1:34:47] uh I'm trying to think how to compress
[1:34:49] this from an hour to about five minutes
[1:34:52] and it's
[1:34:54] I'm not sure of the compression
[1:34:55] algorithm I don't have the advantage of
[1:34:57] AI to help me I guess um but we in
[1:35:02] California when I was a kid I was maybe
[1:35:04] 12 years old and uh my parents
[1:35:07] background we were we grew up in a
[1:35:10] Baptist Church until I was about five
[1:35:13] years old or six and then we moved into
[1:35:15] what's called a Congregational Church
[1:35:17] which is basically uh we like each other
[1:35:21] and and believe whatever you want just
[1:35:24] we're we're a church and by the way
[1:35:26] here's the offering plate um so it it
[1:35:28] was a church that really didn't stand
[1:35:30] for much of anything um but we went
[1:35:33] there because my oldest brother's
[1:35:35] friends went there in high school and my
[1:35:37] parents didn't want to split the family
[1:35:39] so that's where we went mom taught
[1:35:40] Sunday school etc
[1:35:42] etc anyway
[1:35:46] um we wound up
[1:35:49] then uh my mom worked at Sears which
[1:35:52] used to be a big company sort of like
[1:35:54] Walmart or Amazon today but it was
[1:35:56] called Sears back in those days and she
[1:35:58] got a new boss and that boss so was
[1:36:01] introducing himself to the department
[1:36:04] that he was running and at that little
[1:36:06] lunch meeting he mentioned something
[1:36:08] about the Holy Spirit and my mom came to
[1:36:12] him afterwards and said what what's this
[1:36:14] about this Holy Spirit what are you
[1:36:15] talking about and so uh he he witnessed
[1:36:18] to her and uh and that was brother
[1:36:21] Lonnie Jenkins many of you may have
[1:36:22] heard of him or know know him over the
[1:36:24] years and uh so uh time went by we went
[1:36:29] to a Lutheran Church uh that was uh
[1:36:33] practicing some of this Pentecostal
[1:36:36] experience if you will that was led by
[1:36:38] brother linhard who was an associate
[1:36:40] pastor here for many years um and uh
[1:36:44] there was a a group of
[1:36:46] us we got uh I'm trying to condense this
[1:36:50] to to get to your
[1:36:52] question sorry that it's taking so
[1:36:55] long
[1:36:57] that we were invited to leave the
[1:37:00] Lutheran Church and so we did and we we
[1:37:04] started meeting in a in a house several
[1:37:07] families left and and uh through their
[1:37:11] uh ties offerings whatever you wish to
[1:37:14] call it financial support uh so the
[1:37:16] larts were able to rent a uh an
[1:37:19] apartment and we met in that apartment
[1:37:22] and uh about about that time there was a
[1:37:24] a church in San Jose that's where this
[1:37:27] was taking place that was sold and uh
[1:37:31] and and about that time another fell
[1:37:33] came walking down the street and I don't
[1:37:35] know how he came across brother Lonnie
[1:37:38] and brother linhard but he said I've got
[1:37:40] tapes of a prophet you've got to
[1:37:43] here what's this what are you talking
[1:37:46] about um
[1:37:48] so uh they they wound up uh
[1:37:55] allowing the brother to play this tape
[1:37:56] for them because they wanted to screen
[1:37:58] it before the group would be exposed to
[1:38:00] this potential heresy it was something
[1:38:03] called choosing of a bride and uh and
[1:38:07] and and the brother had attended brother
[1:38:09] Doug McHugh's Church in San Jose which
[1:38:11] had just been sold and most of that
[1:38:13] church had moved to Tucson and and these
[1:38:16] people hadn't quite left yet the the
[1:38:19] Mayfields some of you may know them
[1:38:21] anyway uh so we got permission from the
[1:38:25] people that were um selling the church
[1:38:29] and the people that were buying the
[1:38:30] church while it went through escrow we
[1:38:32] could have use of that building it was
[1:38:34] about a two week period of time so we
[1:38:37] wound up starting with uh choosing of a
[1:38:39] bride and then we heard the church ages
[1:38:42] and the and the breach and God in
[1:38:44] Simplicity and the seals and we were
[1:38:45] meeting at least once every night a week
[1:38:47] and on Saturday and Sunday one of those
[1:38:50] days we met twice and one of those days
[1:38:51] we met three times I don't remember what
[1:38:53] it was but we really got um a good dose
[1:38:57] of uh of brother brandom's Ministry and
[1:39:01] then and then the Lord you know we
[1:39:03] didn't have use of that building anymore
[1:39:05] but then the Lord seemed to be moving
[1:39:06] through uh through the spirit through
[1:39:08] various prophecies and whatnot and uh
[1:39:12] and I don't know all the details because
[1:39:13] by this time I was 16 years old and this
[1:39:16] was
[1:39:17] 1966 and uh the short version is that
[1:39:21] most of that group then wound up moving
[1:39:23] to Tucson over a period of of of a few
[1:39:26] months
[1:39:28] um and so we had as a group we had uh
[1:39:34] come into the contact with the Holy
[1:39:36] Spirit we had had some of these
[1:39:38] prophecies the exposure to the message
[1:39:41] Led into the message came to Tucson
[1:39:43] we're attending Tucson Tabernacle um and
[1:39:47] and and everything it it everything just
[1:39:49] seemed to be right and right on the word
[1:39:51] and right and the spirit was good and
[1:39:53] all the rest of it and and we lived in a
[1:39:56] different trailer court it wasn't in
[1:39:57] presca it was over here on on Miracle
[1:39:59] Mile uh Beware of trailer cords um so we
[1:40:04] lived in close proximity to one another
[1:40:07] very close proximity and and uh and we
[1:40:11] wound up um having our own little uh
[1:40:15] meetings on Saturday uh and uh uh and
[1:40:20] and different prophecies would come
[1:40:23] different uh uh words from the Lord I'll
[1:40:27] put that in quotes carefully because in
[1:40:29] many cases I believe they were from the
[1:40:31] Lord uh I mean there were Miracles that
[1:40:33] were happening there were healings that
[1:40:35] were happening there were people that
[1:40:36] were coming to the Lord there it it was
[1:40:39] it was a marvelous time quite frankly
[1:40:43] but then uh uh over time and and during
[1:40:48] part of this time I was I was drafted I
[1:40:52] was in the army I was in the 101st
[1:40:54] Airborne Division the yomer war happened
[1:40:57] a lot of things were going on but during
[1:41:00] those years in the very early 70s uh
[1:41:04] some of the families that were living in
[1:41:06] the trailer court felt like the Lord was
[1:41:09] moving on them to move to
[1:41:11] Israel so they wound up going to Israel
[1:41:15] and and when I got out of the Army in
[1:41:18] 1974 Heather and I looked at each other
[1:41:20] and said well okay we're here in
[1:41:22] Kentucky we can go to Tucson but all our
[1:41:25] families move they don't live in Tucson
[1:41:27] anymore we could go to Israel wherever
[1:41:29] we go we can get a one-way ticket but we
[1:41:31] can't get a round trip so we wound up
[1:41:33] going to Israel and we wound up
[1:41:37] uh being very well connected with the
[1:41:40] group that was there well there
[1:41:42] were a lot of
[1:41:45] strange
[1:41:47] uh I don't know what to call them call
[1:41:49] them prophecies call them leadings call
[1:41:51] them people were believing that it was
[1:41:53] the Lord that was leading them in these
[1:41:54] things and and so the question is so how
[1:41:58] do you how do you know when things are
[1:42:00] drifting away from what's real in spite
[1:42:04] of the fact that you might say wow I've
[1:42:06] got the witness of the Holy Spirit of
[1:42:08] this or the Lord confirm that or there
[1:42:09] was this dream and there was this
[1:42:11] interpretation there were all of these
[1:42:14] things I I I think part of what a person
[1:42:17] needs to do in a case like that is is
[1:42:20] not only be very sure of where your
[1:42:22] anchor is is but but go to someone like
[1:42:25] your pastor and talk to them and not
[1:42:28] just the leader of your little group go
[1:42:31] outside of that little group to get some
[1:42:35] additional counsel some additional
[1:42:37] feedback some additional input uh and
[1:42:40] I'm not saying to override your pastor
[1:42:42] I'm not saying anything like that but
[1:42:45] understand that God is moving here in
[1:42:47] Tucson Tabernacle he is right now but
[1:42:50] God's also moving in other places and
[1:42:53] not only our sister message churches God
[1:42:55] is moving God is not limited to the
[1:42:58] message
[1:43:00] God he's not limited so so sometimes you
[1:43:04] have to reach out a little beyond that
[1:43:06] I'll I'll take a little side step here
[1:43:08] when I lived in in Washington for a
[1:43:10] number of years we had a little Friday
[1:43:12] morning group that uh we wound up uh we
[1:43:15] were meeting in restaurants for a while
[1:43:17] but who wants to meet in a restaurant so
[1:43:20] we came to Heather's restaurant and so
[1:43:22] every Friday morning there was a group
[1:43:24] of about six of us who would get
[1:43:26] together and we were all about 10 years
[1:43:28] apart so we had a wide range of people
[1:43:30] from 30 40 50 60 70 80 and various
[1:43:34] backgrounds I was the only guy that had
[1:43:36] any background in the message I think a
[1:43:39] couple the other guys may have had a
[1:43:41] little bit of a of a Pentecostal
[1:43:43] background but we had two Quakers and we
[1:43:46] had uh oh gosh I don't remember what
[1:43:49] some of the denominational names were
[1:43:51] but these were my brothers
[1:43:53] and and we had good Fellowship wonderful
[1:43:56] Fellowship around the word we had
[1:43:58] wonderful fellowship and and over time
[1:44:01] the barriers could come down and then we
[1:44:04] could be genuine we could be open we
[1:44:07] could be honest we could share we knew
[1:44:09] what was said in that room stayed in
[1:44:12] that room if I was having a problem with
[1:44:14] something I could ask these brothers to
[1:44:16] pray for me and they would but it wasn't
[1:44:18] just pray for me and forget about it it
[1:44:20] then becomes a oh well you know Lyall um
[1:44:22] three weeks ago you said you were having
[1:44:24] this problem how is that
[1:44:26] going accountability Beyond transparency
[1:44:30] and authenticity there must be
[1:44:32] accountability and if there's not
[1:44:34] accountability then the other kind of
[1:44:36] doesn't work so well so in this group
[1:44:39] when we were in Israel we were only
[1:44:40] accountable to
[1:44:42] ourselves and so we wound up I'll give
[1:44:45] you a couple of examples um did you
[1:44:48] know did you
[1:44:51] know that that the two witnesses were
[1:44:54] brother green and brother linhard that
[1:44:57] brother green was the one that would
[1:44:58] have the spirit of Elijah and that
[1:44:59] brother linhard would be the one the
[1:45:01] spirit of Moses did you know that we
[1:45:03] knew that we knew that did you know that
[1:45:06] when the king came that that King was
[1:45:09] named Joseph brandham we knew that we
[1:45:12] knew that did you know that no well of
[1:45:14] course you didn't know that because it's
[1:45:16] not true none of it's true but but we
[1:45:19] didn't know it wasn't true we thought it
[1:45:21] was so you get these Revelations you get
[1:45:24] these words and somebody opens a Bible
[1:45:27] and they point out to some obscure
[1:45:28] scripture about this or about that and
[1:45:31] and the next thing you know well well
[1:45:33] the Lord answered this prayer there
[1:45:34] there was this person that was healed
[1:45:36] there's these wonderful things happening
[1:45:38] we're we're building bridges to the
[1:45:39] Jewish people here in this Orthodox
[1:45:41] community and they're coming to us and
[1:45:43] they're bringing their children to be
[1:45:44] prayed for and they're being healed and
[1:45:46] there's all these wonderful things that
[1:45:47] are happening surely this is of the Lord
[1:45:51] but it wasn't it wasn't so I I would say
[1:45:55] that that you have to go beyond your
[1:45:58] little group if you're really tight with
[1:46:01] a few people you have to reach beyond
[1:46:04] that tight of a few people from time to
[1:46:06] time to get your balance to get to to be
[1:46:09] sure your Sails are set right and you're
[1:46:11] actually going on the right course that
[1:46:13] that the light you're seeing isn't a
[1:46:14] false light but it's it's the real light
[1:46:17] so so i' i' I've been there um uh I've
[1:46:22] I've found wonderful Christian
[1:46:24] Fellowship outside of the message I
[1:46:26] found wonderful Christian Fellowship
[1:46:28] inside the message God is Not restricted
[1:46:31] to our group God is Not restricted to
[1:46:34] just us God is so much bigger than that
[1:46:38] and um I don't know I should probably
[1:46:41] stop at this point God bless you brother
[1:46:45] that was good very
[1:46:47] good very very good advice um one thing
[1:46:51] brother Lyall was talking about he was
[1:46:52] talking about uh there would be signs
[1:46:55] that would come forward and maybe you
[1:46:56] open your Bible or or something happens
[1:47:00] the book of Jeremiah I believe it
[1:47:02] is the Lord is
[1:47:05] addressing
[1:47:07] these I don't know if they were false
[1:47:09] prophets I can't remember exactly um who
[1:47:12] they were but they were
[1:47:13] deceivers and he says and the dreams
[1:47:17] that you caused yourself to dream
[1:47:24] so we can actually make
[1:47:26] ourselves through self-will because we
[1:47:29] want something so bad we can actually
[1:47:30] make ourselves dream something or have a
[1:47:34] sign or see a sign brother uh Joseph
[1:47:37] told me one time Brother Joseph brandom
[1:47:38] he said we were talking
[1:47:41] about um some of the things that were
[1:47:43] were going on in church and the Lord was
[1:47:44] really blessing us in the church and
[1:47:48] and there were some people that raised
[1:47:51] it to a
[1:47:54] level that was too
[1:47:56] far and I remember Brother Joseph told
[1:47:58] me he said the holy spirit will take it
[1:48:01] up to a certain
[1:48:03] place and then sometimes we will take
[1:48:06] it higher than that to a place that the
[1:48:10] Lord didn't want to go so he can bless
[1:48:13] us up to a certain spot but then we can
[1:48:16] take it to a place that's not the Lord's
[1:48:20] will sister Jessica
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:46] I know we going through the
[1:48:51] fire it's getting hard to stand the
[1:48:57] heat but even harder is the
[1:49:03] wondering is God's hand still on
[1:49:11] me it's lonely in the
[1:49:13] Flames When you're counting days of
[1:49:18] pain but The Potter Knows the Clay

[1:49:46] design but it'll take some fire and time

[1:50:04] Clay friend I just came through that
[1:50:09] far not too very long
[1:50:15] ago and looking back I can't see
[1:50:20] why and that my go God was in
[1:50:28] control but on the hottest days I'd cry
[1:50:31] oh Lord isn't it about
[1:50:37] time but The Potter Knows the

[1:51:11] time it's going to be
[1:51:16] okay cuz the poter Knows the
[1:51:21] Clay he's land a beautiful
[1:51:26] design but it'll take some fight and
[1:51:32] time it's going to be
[1:51:38] okay cuz the Potter He Knows the
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:51] Clay okay the last
[1:51:53] question and brother Arie I'm going to
[1:51:55] start with you and all of the young
[1:51:58] people their ears are going to perk up
[1:52:02] and um this is a very very important
[1:52:04] question I remember when we would have
[1:52:06] camp and I was one of the counselors
[1:52:08] this was the question that the the guys
[1:52:11] they'd all get together and they said uh
[1:52:14] brother brother
[1:52:16] Daniel how' you
[1:52:18] know how did you know who to marry
[1:52:23] and I want to go let's let's have fairly
[1:52:25] short answers but I I want to go
[1:52:28] through and and pull the audience
[1:52:32] here and ask how did you know that this
[1:52:37] man or this
[1:52:39] woman was the one that God had chosen
[1:52:41] for
[1:52:45] you well for me it took some time for
[1:52:48] sure I did know I fell in love with
[1:52:50] Rachel and uh when she left the camp up
[1:52:54] in Colorado I was love sick literally
[1:52:57] I it was a family Camp up in where your
[1:53:01] wife used to I mean your mother-in-law
[1:53:03] sorry and she um left and I
[1:53:07] was I told to a couple of brothers and
[1:53:10] said yeah we're all like that but we
[1:53:11] won't say it so I'm not sure they were
[1:53:13] telling the truth but I couldn't even
[1:53:16] eat for a day or two and and some people
[1:53:19] talked me into eating and I threw up so
[1:53:21] that's how love sick I was but then it
[1:53:25] took about three years before we were
[1:53:28] married three and a half years and the
[1:53:31] towards the end you know Jesus said who
[1:53:35] God puts together let not man put aund
[1:53:38] so I feel like I my father-in-law told
[1:53:42] future father-in-law told me to stay in
[1:53:44] Tucson I came down
[1:53:47] to um
[1:53:53] well find myself I'll say it that way
[1:53:55] maybe find God but then I just joke
[1:53:57] around a little bit too much you know
[1:53:59] and and so I found myself and I just
[1:54:02] want to lose myself now and and but I
[1:54:06] came down
[1:54:08] and and he says yeah you better get a
[1:54:11] little more serious uh her father did so
[1:54:15] he said stay here till I come back I'm
[1:54:17] going to take her back to Indiana and
[1:54:19] then we're going to come back and I I
[1:54:21] waited quite a while I don't remember
[1:54:23] how many days or weeks and I was my
[1:54:25] grandma my grandma and we didn't have
[1:54:28] phones and she didn't even have a phone
[1:54:29] a regular landline and I told the
[1:54:34] uh uh told my dad gave him a pay phone
[1:54:38] to call and tell
[1:54:40] whoever answers the phone that I'll pay
[1:54:43] him when they bring the message to me it
[1:54:46] was at cortero farms where that Walmart
[1:54:48] is now there's a little post office box
[1:54:51] and I mean a post office real post
[1:54:54] office and a little store and the phone
[1:54:57] so I was just getting ready to leave I
[1:54:59] mean I would been gone in seconds with
[1:55:01] my truck back up to
[1:55:04] Oakland and my aunt drove right in front
[1:55:07] of my car my truck and said jumped out
[1:55:10] and said Do You Believe In Miracles I
[1:55:11] said sure what's going on she said um by
[1:55:15] walking by this pay phone she said and
[1:55:17] it was ringing she said and the store
[1:55:18] owner said don't answer it it's always
[1:55:21] the wrong number
[1:55:23] and she said well this might be my lucky
[1:55:25] day and she answered and it was Sammy
[1:55:27] Allen was calling for my dad my dad
[1:55:29] didn't want to waste time doing that you
[1:55:31] know so he had Sammy Allen do it Sammy
[1:55:33] Allen says stay there because your
[1:55:35] sisters are coming in from a mission
[1:55:38] Michigan camp and then that night Rachel
[1:55:40] came back so that's not real you know a
[1:55:44] Audible Voice but it
[1:55:48] did well I I knew I was in love with her
[1:55:51] you know I mean I thought of a lot of
[1:55:53] her and that but I'd seen a lot of
[1:55:55] failures a lot of messes a lot of things
[1:55:58] I was not interested in and Paul said it
[1:56:01] was better to be single so I was going
[1:56:04] that route as best I could every time I
[1:56:07] get alone or her you had some time to
[1:56:10] think I'd think about her you know so I
[1:56:13] don't know how to say it that was just
[1:56:14] my
[1:56:16] experience very good someone
[1:56:20] else brother I knew you're were going to
[1:56:23] raise your hand and I'll go to you
[1:56:27] next this not might not be the place but
[1:56:31] uh the holy spirit is a part of the
[1:56:34] story and I hope you'll give me Grace uh
[1:56:37] especially some of your parents but uh I
[1:56:42] knew when I had four
[1:56:44] kids and I was at cand Dutch and poor as
[1:56:49] heck and we were four years I mean we
[1:56:51] were
[1:56:52] five years married with four kids and I
[1:56:56] had to have my wisdom teeth
[1:56:58] out and when I had my wisdom teeth out
[1:57:04] um Sarah took care of me and she called
[1:57:08] my boss you know I I took care of
[1:57:12] everything not not when I was knocked
[1:57:14] out with my wisdom teeth and she took
[1:57:17] care of me and she drove me around and
[1:57:20] she she called I had three job so she
[1:57:22] called EV every different job and told
[1:57:25] them what was going on made sure that I
[1:57:28] was okay and
[1:57:29] everything and then in retrospect I
[1:57:32] realized the passion that we had had
[1:57:34] over the four years and all the all that
[1:57:37] stuff it it had God's hand in it every
[1:57:40] step of the way it took me until I had
[1:57:43] four kids and had my wisdom teeth out to
[1:57:46] realized that I was in this thing that
[1:57:49] had been going along all the while so
[1:57:52] yeah it uh it's not exactly love it's
[1:57:56] First Sight and the and God coming down
[1:57:59] in a light shining it was after after
[1:58:03] going through so much so much and and
[1:58:07] growing up and growing up and looking
[1:58:09] over and having the love of my life
[1:58:11] right there taking care of
[1:58:14] [Applause]
[1:58:20] me where do I start start I was 16 years
[1:58:23] old when I first saw my husband uh my
[1:58:27] mother had invited me to go to the
[1:58:29] grocery store and once I got there I
[1:58:32] told her I don't want to get down I'll
[1:58:34] just stay in the
[1:58:35] car
[1:58:38] and Charlie I guess he I had never seen
[1:58:41] him before and he was taking groceries
[1:58:45] out and helping this lady put her
[1:58:47] groceries in the car and while he was
[1:58:50] gathering baskets he went right next to
[1:58:53] my car and I heard a a voice and it said
[1:58:59] that's your husband wow and I was very
[1:59:02] shy so I scooted all the way down to the
[1:59:04] dashboard and I thought I hope he didn't
[1:59:06] see me I hope you didn't hear what was
[1:59:11] said and the rest is history we were
[1:59:14] married for 53
[1:59:19] years that's amazing
[1:59:22] yes
[1:59:26] sir I asked her six times before she
[1:59:29] said
[1:59:31] yes one time for each
[1:59:40] kid yeah one for each child that's
[1:59:43] pretty good brother
[1:59:45] eron for me I was living in Israel um
[1:59:49] same group that brother Lyle was in
[1:59:52] and Kathy and I started corresponding um
[1:59:56] we didn't have email we didn't have
[1:59:58] weren't able to phone but we would start
[2:00:02] to correspond the old the oldfashioned
[2:00:04] way write a
[2:00:05] letter and it's been an amazing journey
[2:00:09] with a fabulous woman like Kathy but I
[2:00:12] have to say that God was in it the whole
[2:00:14] way I didn't know it right at first but
[2:00:17] I would write a letter asking her a
[2:00:19] question and a matter of I i' mail my
[2:00:23] letter and a day or two later I got a
[2:00:26] response I got a letter from Kathy and
[2:00:28] she was already answering the question
[2:00:30] that I had asked and she hadn't gotten
[2:00:32] my letter yet so each and this went on
[2:00:36] for three four months and uh just knew
[2:00:40] that God was in it and just uh it's
[2:00:44] it's you can't explain it any other way
[2:00:47] I mean God was in it and it was just uh
[2:00:49] been the the biggest blessing in my
[2:00:56] life sometimes you just
[2:00:58] know someone
[2:01:01] else sister
[2:01:06] Heather I love my dad I trusted my dad I
[2:01:11] always thought look my dad loves me he
[2:01:13] only has good in mind for me so if I
[2:01:17] ever get the thought of somebody I'm
[2:01:18] going to check and be sure what he
[2:01:20] thinks so La was amazing he brought me
[2:01:24] flowers he wrote poetry and all this
[2:01:27] stuff and I was overwhelmed by all this
[2:01:29] this amazingness and so I went to my dad
[2:01:32] I said dad I don't know if I love him or
[2:01:35] if I like these things that he's doing
[2:01:37] you know and so he said well he said
[2:01:42] Heather he's a this is he my dad wasn't
[2:01:45] in the message he said he's a fine
[2:01:49] Christian young man he from A Fine
[2:01:53] Christian
[2:01:54] family he uh he's pretty smart and he
[2:01:58] said he's a little bit skinny but you
[2:02:00] could fix that and there was not one
[2:02:02] thing negative so I left my dad think
[2:02:05] okay all right I can look at this
[2:02:08] positively so all I would say is please
[2:02:11] don't bypass your parents
[2:02:18] yes that should have been a standing
[2:02:19] ovation
[2:02:22] and
[2:02:23] dads always have a good
[2:02:26] relationship with your kids especially
[2:02:29] your daughters because they will they'll
[2:02:31] trust you someone
[2:02:37] else how' you know what six the six
[2:02:43] times it was actually five
[2:02:47] times I did first I have to um clarify
[2:02:51] something I said prior um the meatball
[2:02:55] soup it was leftovers with when meatball
[2:02:57] we'd had a lot of Meatballs the day
[2:03:00] before but there was only soup with one
[2:03:03] meatball left and that's
[2:03:06] when I don't even remember if I prayed
[2:03:08] or not but anyway we all got one
[2:03:09] meatball in our Bowl but I did not know
[2:03:13] Aaron was one I did a lot of praying and
[2:03:17] my advice to young girls would be pray
[2:03:20] and pray and when you think you've
[2:03:22] prayed enough pray some
[2:03:24] more um I just knew that the thought of
[2:03:28] not being with him was
[2:03:31] like too
[2:03:33] painful but then I wanted to be sure so
[2:03:38] when he asked me I said no because I
[2:03:41] don't
[2:03:41] know but you know there never was the
[2:03:46] certainty of oh I know he's the one but
[2:03:49] there was the fact that I could not
[2:03:53] stand to not be with him and then even
[2:03:56] after I got married which is funny but
[2:03:59] some people might not think it's funny
[2:04:02] like two weeks after our wedding I'm
[2:04:03] like oh no what did I
[2:04:05] [Laughter]
[2:04:09] do but I I you know 44 years I think
[2:04:15] we're going on so the Lord's been with
[2:04:17] us just the Lord keep the Lord in it
[2:04:21] always
[2:04:26] always it's been 25 years and I I think
[2:04:29] my wife says oh no what did I
[2:04:32] do anyone
[2:04:37] else who's you pointing sister
[2:04:41] Rachel you obviously had this guy you
[2:04:44] had this guy
[2:04:45] enamored I mean he couldn't eat he was
[2:04:48] wasting a away to nothing how did how
[2:04:51] did you know it was
[2:04:56] him I didn't really know either but I I
[2:05:00] do know that he won my whole family
[2:05:03] because every time he came he would
[2:05:04] bring gifts um but my mother asked me a
[2:05:09] question this was after I was engaged I
[2:05:11] was close to getting married and she
[2:05:13] says well how do we know this is right
[2:05:15] and I says well Mom I don't know what
[2:05:17] the future holds but I feel like you
[2:05:19] just trust the Lord with day by day and
[2:05:21] if and if he if you feel like it's right
[2:05:24] today you know you look to the Future
[2:05:26] he's going to take care of the future so
[2:05:28] that's how I took it thank
[2:05:36] you all right
[2:05:41] Amos both of you I don't want to start a
[2:05:43] fight no I'm just
[2:05:46] kidding how' you know was
[2:05:48] that um
[2:05:52] at first I didn't know but um I grew up
[2:05:57] very isolated and
[2:06:00] um I saw you know I left for college
[2:06:05] after a while and spent about six years
[2:06:07] at College much too long and then uh
[2:06:10] while I was in college I um started
[2:06:12] seeing like different people and know
[2:06:15] the way they were and then when I met
[2:06:17] Abby I could just tell there was
[2:06:18] something different about her and that I
[2:06:21] really wanted to marry her and whether
[2:06:23] it was right or not that's who I was
[2:06:25] going
[2:06:27] for okay Abby was he right my story is a
[2:06:31] little more spiritual than
[2:06:34] that if you know us we I knew him as a
[2:06:37] friend for a long time he hung out with
[2:06:39] my family all the time you'd see him
[2:06:41] with them and I wasn't even around like
[2:06:43] we were good friends and then I fell
[2:06:46] with feelings for him and I asked the
[2:06:50] Lord and it was one of those things when
[2:06:51] you're like I want this so badly and
[2:06:53] you're fighting the Lord for it and the
[2:06:55] Lord's telling you no and you're like
[2:06:56] but I want it and I can't get it up and
[2:06:58] I know you're asking me to give it up
[2:07:01] and so I was like okay I'm not going to
[2:07:03] have peace until I give the Lord what
[2:07:05] he's asking so I said okay Lord I he's
[2:07:08] yours not going to not going to go for
[2:07:10] that so um we stayed friends obviously
[2:07:14] um and then he went to they' have the
[2:07:17] Easter meetings and stuff at Jeff so he
[2:07:19] would still go back there and remember
[2:07:21] he went back for those and he decided he
[2:07:25] also had feelings for me um so when he
[2:07:28] came back we started dating he talked to
[2:07:30] my dad we started dating and all this
[2:07:32] time I all I felt was I never got a yes
[2:07:35] from the Lord I always remember I got a
[2:07:37] no but it bothered me because I never
[2:07:38] got a yes and we were engaged for a long
[2:07:41] time and this now that I think about it
[2:07:43] I'm like this is not a good thing if you
[2:07:45] have a question in your heart you should
[2:07:47] not be marrying someone until you get
[2:07:50] your yes but then I found out but later
[2:07:51] it was the Lord so I um we engaged we
[2:07:56] fought a lot because with our different
[2:07:58] backgrounds we have a lot of the same
[2:08:00] ideas but we're coming at it from the
[2:08:01] different and we fought everything out
[2:08:04] so much so people are like do they even
[2:08:05] love each other like should they be
[2:08:07] getting married but we fought so much
[2:08:09] that after we got married we' fought
[2:08:10] everything out so you know it was better
[2:08:13] but we were engaged we're driving down
[2:08:15] the road me and Rachel and I'm like I
[2:08:16] just wish there was a big sign in the
[2:08:19] sky this is who you should marry the
[2:08:21] biggest longest shooting star I have
[2:08:24] ever seen in my life just fall straight
[2:08:26] down Rachel's about losing her mind
[2:08:28] because she probably was also worried
[2:08:30] for us and so she's like there it is
[2:08:32] there it is and I'm like I don't know so
[2:08:35] Rachel's like I think that was for me so
[2:08:38] we get married and even after it still
[2:08:40] bothered me like you never got your yes
[2:08:43] you got your no but you never went back
[2:08:45] and got your yes and it wasn't until
[2:08:48] probably years we were married and his
[2:08:51] mom M told me that time he went back
[2:08:55] East is when he got the Holy
[2:08:57] Ghost and the timing was so perfect that
[2:09:02] the Lord said no and it's after he got
[2:09:04] the Holy Ghost then we started dating
[2:09:06] and then we got engaged and then you
[2:09:09] know so it wasn't for a long time where
[2:09:12] I was sure yeah this is what the Lord um
[2:09:14] but I had a second part to that story
[2:09:16] that's been on my heart the other night
[2:09:18] when the northern lights were coming so
[2:09:20] shooting stars always are special to me
[2:09:22] now I'm like it's little confirmation
[2:09:23] from the Lord that you know Amos is mine
[2:09:26] um
[2:09:27] so shootings the uh northern lights were
[2:09:30] coming and I got home late and I wanted
[2:09:32] to see it um and me and my sister had
[2:09:34] just been talking about being a good mom
[2:09:36] and how to be a good mom to my kids and
[2:09:39] I always question myself and I'm always
[2:09:40] like you know praying and wondering am I
[2:09:43] doing a good job so that was on my heart
[2:09:45] so it we got home really late they put
[2:09:47] the kids to bed and I'm standing outside
[2:09:49] I'm like Lord I want to see this like
[2:09:50] this would be really cool I want to see
[2:09:52] these lights um and now as I'm out there
[2:09:54] I shoot see a shooting star like falling
[2:09:57] and it was just like oh yeah that's cool
[2:09:59] so Chloe hadn't gone to sleep yet so I
[2:10:01] brought her out and I show we got to see
[2:10:03] the Northern Lights it was real faint it
[2:10:05] kind of just looked like dust but I took
[2:10:06] a picture with my phone and you could
[2:10:07] see the pink and the streaks and um and
[2:10:10] then we saw another shooting star
[2:10:12] together and then it was like your
[2:10:14] children were on your heart and you were
[2:10:16] talking to the Lord and he gave you the
[2:10:19] one of the desires you just asked him to
[2:10:20] see these lights and you got to see them
[2:10:22] and he gave you the shooting stars so
[2:10:24] now it's like shooting stars are now
[2:10:26] Amos and my entire family it's like the
[2:10:29] Lord knew how to speak just to me amen
[2:10:31] and show me I'm mindful of you this is
[2:10:33] special to you this is what I do for you
[2:10:36] and like the lord always knows how to
[2:10:38] speak to us individually and things that
[2:10:40] mean something to us so you might still
[2:10:45] not know but if you see a shooting stop
[2:10:47] the Lord knows that you know
[2:10:52] um to go with that
[2:10:55] um I knew right when I met her that I
[2:10:57] was going to marry her she just didn't
[2:10:58] know
[2:11:01] so amen praise the Lord the musicians
[2:11:05] can can get ready my my testimony with
[2:11:08] Stephanie's real similar to brother
[2:11:11] Amos um I just
[2:11:13] knew well first of all the first time I
[2:11:15] saw her I was like wow that's the
[2:11:19] prettiest girl I've ever seen in my life
[2:11:22] but there's something that goes beyond
[2:11:25] that and one thing that was always
[2:11:27] important to me is I wanted a wife that
[2:11:31] was going to be a good mother that was
[2:11:33] the number one criteria in me choosing a
[2:11:38] wife was that she was going to be a good
[2:11:41] mom and you know I was 21 22 23 24 and
[2:11:48] my friends started getting married and I
[2:11:50] didn't I didn't have a wife and I you
[2:11:53] know they tried to set me up with with
[2:11:55] different people I just I just don't
[2:11:56] like being around this person but when I
[2:11:59] met
[2:12:00] her the first time that we
[2:12:05] talked I just wanted to get around her
[2:12:08] again and then I wanted to be around her
[2:12:11] again and now it's been 25 years and I
[2:12:14] still I want to be around her all the
[2:12:16] time and that's when God you know that
[2:12:18] God really gives you the right one
