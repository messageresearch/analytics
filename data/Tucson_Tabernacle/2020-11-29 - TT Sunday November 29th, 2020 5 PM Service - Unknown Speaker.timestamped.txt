[27:59] guys you guys all passed the test I was
[28:01] thinking this morning or even this week
[28:03] I thought I should thank the
[28:04] congregation more for participating in
[28:06] all our little quirks and things we do
[28:09] and you just come in and bringing your
[28:12] lick of fire and singing and worshiping
[28:14] God it's certainly easier to lead
[28:17] worship when you all are worshiping as
[28:20] well rather than it just being just a
[28:22] performance or us it's just up there
[28:24] here singing for you all but it it
[28:26] really helps when you are singing and so
[28:28] thank you for that I know sometimes in
[28:30] the last 5 years we've been a smaller
[28:32] congregation maybe going through
[28:34] different things a little quieter but
[28:36] you all have helped put your shoulder to
[28:39] the wheel and I appreciate that so thank
[28:41] you for doing that for us amen I'm going
[28:45] to ask brother Dan Roberts if you would
[28:47] just come and just open the service with
[28:49] a word of prayer and take these requests
[28:52] that they been turned in Sister
[28:54] Elizabeth Beth Gara Beth is asking
[28:57] prayer for herself she is not feeling
[28:59] well she also asks for healing for
[29:01] insomnia God bless you and thank you for
[29:04] praying also I don't see brother Peter
[29:07] and sister Lydia mcfaden here tonight I
[29:09] don't see them so I think my
[29:12] understanding was Sister Lydia wasn't
[29:14] feeling well so let's just remember them
[29:16] in prayer and that's why they weren't
[29:17] here this morning um we weren't sure how
[29:19] much that was but at any rate let's just
[29:23] remember them in prayer and the needs
[29:24] that were mentioned this morning and
[29:26] those on the WhatsApp let's just
[29:28] remember each one in prayer let's just
[29:31] sing that song I'm not my own I belong
[29:34] to Jesus he purchased me I'm all his
[29:37] amen as brother Dan

[30:04] his god with a
[30:11] price the
[30:13] blood of
[30:17] Jesus I'm not my
[30:24] own I am his let's sing this as a song
[30:28] of surrender one more
[30:30] time I'm not my
[30:37] own I belong to
[30:43] Jesus he
[30:46] purchased

[31:24] his uh let's pray
[31:28] Lord we just come to you father as your
[31:31] needy people Lord and we just want to
[31:34] praise you and thank you for this day
[31:36] today that be able to worship you and to
[31:39] raise you and lift you up father for all
[31:42] the glorious great things you've done in
[31:44] our lives over time and and helping uh
[31:47] heal and touch each person in here in
[31:50] our needs father uh we have some needs
[31:53] we want to bring forth to you today uh a
[31:56] sister's not able to get through the
[31:58] night with sleep Lord and anybody that's
[32:01] faced that challenge uh knows just how
[32:04] troubling it could be that uh you just
[32:07] don't have the energy or the strength
[32:09] the next day to carry on you feel like
[32:12] you're dragon lord and we just ask you
[32:14] to reach out and touch her and give her
[32:16] that strength and comfort her father and
[32:19] let her know that you're with her Lord
[32:22] we ask you to be with the mcfadin father
[32:25] that they could be healthy again and and
[32:28] our sister there would be able to feel
[32:30] better have some kids to take care of
[32:32] Lord and it's always a challenge when
[32:34] the kids have more energy than you do so
[32:37] we just ask you to touch her father and
[32:40] be with her and be with each unspoken
[32:42] request Lord sometimes we feel like
[32:46] those three in the fire this morning
[32:48] Father where we're standing by ourselves
[32:50] uh but you are with us Lord and we just
[32:53] give everything to you and put it on
[32:55] your altar we pray that we can be the
[32:57] Daniel Lord that we can stand strong
[33:00] against all enemies even if we're
[33:02] standing alone Lord we know that we're
[33:04] standing with you and we give you all
[33:07] the praise and glory father and please
[33:09] answer these needs Lord and bless this
[33:11] service in Jesus name we pray
[33:16] amen you may be seated this
[33:19] evening
[33:20] [Music]
[33:23] amen just thought I'd give a little
[33:25] testimony I was thinking about it there
[33:27] and
[33:28] wasn't really even on my mind but the
[33:31] Matthew had said well that sounded like
[33:32] a real the Watkins had said that sounds
[33:35] like a real testimony so maybe I should
[33:38] share it I as you all know in March when
[33:43] Co
[33:44] hit essentially our line of work that I
[33:47] was in just shut down wasn't that I
[33:49] specifically lost my job but it was just
[33:51] a matter of time and the owners were
[33:53] real good to just say you know if you
[33:55] find something else just go do that the
[33:57] Lord blessed me with a couple different
[33:59] things between now and then and I wasn't
[34:03] exactly looking for something different
[34:05] but the Lord saw it fit to just bring
[34:08] something by my path and it just is a
[34:12] real big blessing because it's
[34:14] significant pay increase from what I'm
[34:17] currently doing with the government and
[34:19] it's more than I've actually ever made
[34:22] with a lot of opportunity and keeping me
[34:23] challenged and so I just want to thank
[34:25] the Lord for just being mindful of us
[34:30] us it's not something like I said I was
[34:33] exactly looking for I was fairly content
[34:37] to say well Lord if this is where you'd
[34:39] like me this is where I'll be but the
[34:41] Lord knows everything amen also I've had
[34:45] a few people at least two people today
[34:47] and number of people the last couple of
[34:49] weeks asked me most out of town but I
[34:51] had two people today asked me if Harmony
[34:53] was happening this year and the decision
[34:56] was made this week that it's going to be
[34:57] canell um at least for Tucson January
[35:01] 2021 um will be cancelled there's a
[35:04] potentially may do something later in
[35:06] the year back east or do something like
[35:09] he did this past fall he did a small
[35:11] mini Harmony I think he called it
[35:14] harmony with Believers in
[35:16] Idaho um Bobby might do something like
[35:19] that again back east or something else
[35:22] but as far as January Harmony here in
[35:25] Tucson that has been cancelled just
[35:29] number of reasons but the primary one
[35:30] being covid uh 19 just not sure what the
[35:34] authorities would would consider and
[35:36] everything and so the decision was made
[35:38] to cancel that for this year
[35:40] so um I think that was all the
[35:43] announcements I had I was going to
[35:46] mention this I thought it was another
[35:47] little Testament last not this Satur
[35:50] past Saturday not yesterday but
[35:51] yesterday a week ago it was actually
[35:55] what three two Sundays ago have been
[35:58] when brother DDA or brother Diggs was
[36:00] here that was 55 years the church being
[36:04] open brother green started the church 55
[36:06] years ago and last Saturday a week ago
[36:09] was 55 years ago brother Brandon
[36:11] preached in the old Tabernacle what
[36:13] house will you build me thought it's
[36:15] just a testament the Lord's kept this
[36:17] this church and the things he's he's
[36:20] wanted us to do is not us as individuals
[36:23] but us as a congregation and the Lord's
[36:26] kept this this work in this little
[36:28] Lighthouse along the road where weary
[36:30] pilgrims can come and find rest amen
[36:32] just want to thank the Lord for that as
[36:34] well
[36:37] amen just sing maybe one song and then
[36:40] we're GNA ask Bel to come up he's got
[36:42] something to share on his heart

[41:29] good evening this is a little
[41:33] different but there was something that
[41:35] really blessed me this month that I
[41:36] found out you probably all know about it
[41:38] and it's old news for you but it was new
[41:40] news for me even if it's 73 years old
[41:44] let me
[41:48] uh yeah and it's all about November
[41:53] 29th so I had a brief thought I asked to
[41:56] share with you and uh I'm closing now so
[41:59] I just have five minutes to go you can
[42:01] start your
[42:03] stopwatches in in Jeremiah 30:1 we read
[42:07] the word that came to Jeremiah from the
[42:10] Lord saying thus speaketh the Lord God
[42:12] of Israel saying write thee all the
[42:16] words that I have spoken unto thee in a
[42:19] book well to what end would that be just
[42:21] like we heard about Psalm 78 this
[42:23] morning tell our children our children's
[42:25] children what Jeremiah had wasn't for
[42:28] them then but he says for Lo the days
[42:32] come saeth the Lord that I will bring
[42:35] again the Captivity of My People Israel
[42:39] and Judah saeth the Lord and I will
[42:42] cause them to return to the land that I
[42:45] gave to their fathers and they shall
[42:48] possess it today is November 29th
[42:53] 2020 I'd like you to Journey back in
[42:55] time with me some 73 years the year is
[43:02] 1947 my name is El eer sukenic I came to
[43:07] Palestine in 1911 from Eastern Europe
[43:10] I'm an archaeologist and a professor at
[43:13] the Hebrew University in West Jerusalem
[43:15] here in Palestine this land is under the
[43:19] control of the British government as the
[43:21] result of a mandate to administer this
[43:23] territory following the breakup of the
[43:25] Ottoman Empire after defeat in World War
[43:29] I this mandate was awarded to Great
[43:31] Britain by the now defunct League of
[43:33] Nations at the end of that
[43:35] war this is a very dangerous time here
[43:38] in
[43:39] 1947 Jews Arabs are engaged in a
[43:42] struggle over this place the British are
[43:45] unable to maintain order an Undeclared
[43:48] state of War exists here and every day
[43:51] it gets more dangerous to venture from
[43:53] Jewish areas to Arab ones and vice versa
[43:57] snipers are everywhere no one feels safe
[44:00] from their bullets or from attacks from
[44:03] terrorists on both
[44:05] sides after the Holocaust that killed
[44:08] more than six million of my people the
[44:12] survivors are yet today after two and a
[44:14] half years still herded into camps
[44:16] surrounded by barbed wire not allowed to
[44:19] return to their homes they're not
[44:21] allowed to come here either though most
[44:23] want to America allows only tiny trickle
[44:28] of this displaced Humanity to enter we
[44:31] have enemies on every side I'm reminded
[44:35] of the words of
[44:36] David but I trusted in thee oh Lord I
[44:39] said Thou Art my God my times are in thy
[44:44] hand deliver me from the hand of mine
[44:47] enemies and from them that persecute
[44:50] me but recently in spite of all this I
[44:54] have heard of a possible mind of ancient
[44:58] documents I've examined a tiny fragment
[45:01] of such a document a scroll and I read
[45:04] on it a phrase from the book of Isaiah a
[45:08] friend and I met a few days ago that I
[45:10] might borrow this scrap to see if it's
[45:12] indeed ancient or just another forgery
[45:16] I'm convinced it's real and today I
[45:19] travel with him to Bethlehem that's
[45:22] dangerous Journey it's in the Arab
[45:24] section of this area to see about
[45:26] purchasing the entire scroll along with
[45:29] two others that I am told are part of
[45:31] the same find I Must disguise myself as
[45:34] an Arab and sneak across to East
[45:36] Jerusalem and then to Bethlehem it's a
[45:39] good thing I'm fluent an Arabic or I'd
[45:42] never make this journey and hope to
[45:44] return with my life surely the Lord will
[45:47] forgive me for traveling today for it's
[45:48] Shabbat Saturday November
[45:52] 29th 1947
[46:12] look I've obtained three Scrolls they
[46:16] were found in clay pots and a cave near
[46:19] kurbat kumran down by the Dead Sea this
[46:23] fragment I'm showing you are four
[46:26] columns
[46:27] from the book of
[46:29] Isaiah I must study these
[46:33] documents Professor sukenik then sat in
[46:36] his home well past midnight studying
[46:39] what we now know as the Dead Sea
[46:43] Scrolls then his youngest son burst into
[46:46] the study he announced that the United
[46:48] Nations General Assembly had just voted
[46:51] and passed resolution 181 to partition
[46:54] Palestine and allow the creation
[46:57] of a Jewish State the very same day that
[47:01] the first person was able to read the
[47:04] first
[47:05] scroll Jeremiah 30:3 again for Lo the
[47:09] days come saeth the Lord that I will
[47:13] bring again the Captivity of My People
[47:15] Israel and Judah sayeth the Lord and I
[47:18] will cause them to return to the land
[47:21] that I gave to their fathers and they
[47:24] shall possess it amen I wanted to remind
[47:28] you that today November 29 is the
[47:31] anniversary of the UN resolution that
[47:34] led to the establishment of modern
[47:37] Israel and to share that that very same
[47:39] day for the first time in nearly 2,000
[47:43] years the first of the Dead Sea Scrolls
[47:46] Scrolls that demonstrate the Integrity
[47:49] of biblical transcription over the
[47:51] centuries were read they had been found
[47:53] in a cave several months before but
[47:56] Professor sukenik was the first person
[47:59] to see them who could read them they
[48:02] came into his possession at Great risk
[48:05] to his life on the very same day he was
[48:10] reading them at the very moments the
[48:13] vote was taken and
[48:15] announced many of you may have already
[48:17] known this but it only came to my
[48:19] attention a few weeks ago and I had to

[57:11] was so all right Psalms chapter 78 we'd
[57:15] like to just continue from this morning
[57:17] my people I want to read you this I'm
[57:19] going to read it from a different
[57:21] translation follow along with me in the
[57:22] King James my people hear my teaching
[57:26] listen to the words of my mouth I will
[57:29] open my mouth with a parable I will
[57:31] utter hidden things things from old
[57:35] things we have heard and known and he
[57:38] makes that clear this is something we've
[57:40] heard and we've known but it's
[57:43] not and he says things and things our
[57:46] ancestors have told us we will not hide
[57:49] them from their descendants we will tell
[57:51] the Next Generation the praiseworthy
[57:54] Deeds of the Lord his power and his
[57:57] wonders he has done he decreed statutes
[58:00] for Jacob and established the law in
[58:02] Israel which he commanded our ancestors
[58:05] to teach their children so the Next
[58:08] Generation would know them even the
[58:10] children yet to be born and they in turn
[58:14] would tell their
[58:16] children then they would put their trust
[58:19] in God and would not forget his deeds
[58:23] but would keep his commands
[58:26] they would not be like their ancestors a
[58:28] stubborn and rebellious generation whose
[58:30] Hearts were not loyal to God whose
[58:32] Spirits were not faithful to him notice
[58:36] here in verse 12 he did miracles in the
[58:39] sight of their ancestors and in the land
[58:40] of Egypt in the regions of zoanne he
[58:43] divided the sea and led them through he
[58:45] made the water stand up like a wall
[58:49] imagine that he guided them with the
[58:51] cloud by day and with the light from the
[58:54] fire all night
[58:56] he split the rocks in the wilderness and
[58:58] gave them water as abundant as the Seas
[59:01] he brought streams out of a rocky Crag
[59:05] and made water flow down like Rivers
[59:09] Lord Jesus we thank you for your word
[59:11] tonight we've read it Lord and and I
[59:13] just want you to take preeminence now
[59:17] Lord in this evening service you've
[59:19] already blessed us Lord and visited us
[59:21] this morning been with us throughout the
[59:23] day Lord and I just pray for that same
[59:26] nearness that same presence Lord to come
[59:28] and draw close once again tonight father
[59:31] for we raise our hands together Lord as
[59:34] a body and say we we're we we're thirsty
[59:36] tonight Lord for a drink from Heaven
[59:39] we're hungry Lord in our souls for Mana
[59:42] from on high would you feed it to us
[59:44] Lord Jesus we pray we ask it in Jesus
[59:47] Christ's name amen you can be seated
[59:51] tonight we left off here with this story
[59:55] of Daniel
[59:57] and we learned about Verse 18 faith
[1:00:02] faith that says even
[1:00:04] if even if God doesn't deliver me know
[1:00:08] this oh King I'll still not bow I
[1:00:11] believe it's this kind of Faith as we
[1:00:13] spoke on this morning that we need now
[1:00:16] more than ever before we need that type
[1:00:18] of faith more than ever before to say
[1:00:21] Lord even if I'm still going to believe
[1:00:25] even if I'm still going to go forward
[1:00:27] and I preached this morning that that
[1:00:29] was faith that fights fear Faith That
[1:00:33] Conquers fear fear is as we spoke on
[1:00:36] this morning and said so much about it
[1:00:38] uh the there's a there's a promise in
[1:00:40] Luke chapter 1 and I just want to read
[1:00:42] it to you in verse 68 you can pull it on
[1:00:45] the screen if you want brother Jeremy it
[1:00:47] says blessed be blessed be the Lord God
[1:00:49] for he hath visited and redeemed his
[1:00:52] people and hath raised up a horn of
[1:00:55] salvation for us notice this uh he has
[1:00:59] raised up a horn of salvation for us in
[1:01:01] the house of his servant David we know
[1:01:03] who he's speaking of here uh being
[1:01:05] Christ and he says in verse 70 and he
[1:01:08] spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets
[1:01:11] which have been since the world began
[1:01:15] that we should be saved from our enemies
[1:01:18] now here's the promise that God gives to
[1:01:21] each and every single uh one of his
[1:01:23] children that we should be saved from
[1:01:26] our enemies so the the the victory at
[1:01:30] Calvary brought us this promise that we
[1:01:34] should be saved from our enemies I'm
[1:01:37] thankful for that to perform the mercy
[1:01:41] promised notice this to perform I'll
[1:01:43] finish the verse there from enemies and
[1:01:45] from the hand of all that hate us to
[1:01:48] perform the mercy promised to our
[1:01:51] fathers and to remember His Holy
[1:01:54] Covenant the oath which he swore to Our
[1:01:58] Father Abraham that he would Grant unto
[1:02:01] us that we being in delivered listen to
[1:02:05] this out of the hand of our enemies
[1:02:07] that's one thing to be grateful to say
[1:02:10] Lord I'm I'm glad you've delivered me
[1:02:12] out of the hand of the devil I'm I'm not
[1:02:14] I'm not uh I've been purchased I've been
[1:02:17] bought with the price I'm not my own I
[1:02:19] belong to the Savior but with that comes
[1:02:22] This Promise he says that he would Grant
[1:02:24] unto us this that we being delivered out
[1:02:27] of the hand of our enemies might serve
[1:02:30] him without
[1:02:33] fear might serve him without fear in
[1:02:37] Holiness and righteousness before him I
[1:02:41] love this all the days of our life say
[1:02:45] brother Matt how can I how can I serve
[1:02:47] the Lord I'm free from I'm free from my
[1:02:50] enemies but with that promise also comes
[1:02:53] a promise to be able to serve the Lord
[1:02:56] free from Fear how long all the days of
[1:02:59] my life and so God speaks this promise
[1:03:02] to a to knowing that it was uh swearing
[1:03:05] it by a covenant to Abraham but but
[1:03:08] there's a there's such a embedded
[1:03:10] promise here that we find that the that
[1:03:13] the Savior would Deliver us from our
[1:03:15] enemies but also that that that he would
[1:03:18] enable us or that he would he would he
[1:03:21] would enable us to serve him without
[1:03:23] fear in Holiness and right ousness all
[1:03:27] the days of our life I'm glad for that
[1:03:31] and so it's amazing because when you
[1:03:33] think about this here when you think
[1:03:35] about even this climate as we said this
[1:03:38] morning in the world that we see today
[1:03:40] is such a climate of fear that we live
[1:03:43] in and it's it's a it's it's always if
[1:03:46] you study the lives of God's family all
[1:03:49] the way especially if you study through
[1:03:51] the Old Testament you know what you'll
[1:03:53] always come up with is that when
[1:03:55] whenever it came to battle whenever it
[1:03:58] came to any kind of of of of military
[1:04:02] operation no matter what king it was
[1:04:04] under you you'll most of the time always
[1:04:07] find a characteristic about the enemy
[1:04:10] and God's family and here was the
[1:04:12] characteristic God's family was almost
[1:04:16] always
[1:04:19] outnumbered they almost always were
[1:04:22] outgunned they were almost always were
[1:04:26] outmanned God almost always put his
[1:04:29] family always in this spot of out of a
[1:04:33] of a climate of fear when you looked at
[1:04:35] the outward circumstance because who
[1:04:38] naturally would not get scared or begin
[1:04:41] to get fearful when you look at your
[1:04:43] army of 200,000 and you're look going up
[1:04:46] against an army with 1.5 million it
[1:04:49] seems 200,000 sounds like a lot until
[1:04:51] you're coming against an army five or
[1:04:53] six times that size and God always
[1:04:56] intentionally puts his family against
[1:04:59] the fiery furnace where it looks
[1:05:01] impossible it looks like there's no way
[1:05:03] out he puts Daniel in the Lion's Den he
[1:05:06] puts Shadrach Meshach and abedo in a
[1:05:08] fiery furnace and he's always putting
[1:05:12] he's always putting his children in the
[1:05:14] place to where it looked like as far as
[1:05:16] numbers are concerned it's
[1:05:20] hopeless always outgunned always
[1:05:22] outnumbered always outmanned but always
[1:05:25] with
[1:05:26] God and that's why the Bible says With
[1:05:29] God all things are possible With God all
[1:05:33] things are possible and he always put
[1:05:35] them in a place of total dependence upon
[1:05:40] him this question always was put in the
[1:05:43] way God's family you say brother Matt
[1:05:45] what are you saying here tonight I'm
[1:05:47] saying that for you to trust the Lord
[1:05:51] for everything in your life is not
[1:05:53] unique to 2020
[1:05:56] for you to have to trust the Lord for
[1:05:58] everything in your life is part of being
[1:06:01] a child of God since the
[1:06:05] beginning God's family has always been
[1:06:09] required to trust the
[1:06:13] Lord always they had to go with faith
[1:06:17] and faith we walk by faith and not by
[1:06:19] sight and the family of God has always
[1:06:22] had to trust they've always and and so
[1:06:24] because of this you'll find in the
[1:06:26] Psalms you'll find many times in the
[1:06:28] Psalms David beginning even before War
[1:06:31] uh before there was ever a great contest
[1:06:33] or a great battle and he was outnumbered
[1:06:35] and he'd begin to pray and he'd say many
[1:06:37] are they increased uh that trouble me uh
[1:06:40] many are they that surround me and it
[1:06:42] would David would always begin to sing
[1:06:44] songs uh and it what was those songs to
[1:06:47] do those those songs were to build up an
[1:06:50] atmosphere of Faith because if he didn't
[1:06:53] sing those songs all he could look at
[1:06:55] was what he seen with his own two eyes
[1:06:57] and what he could see with his own two
[1:06:59] eyes was an Army greater than his when
[1:07:01] he looked with his own two eyes all he
[1:07:03] seen was an impossible situation and but
[1:07:06] yet God put him in this situation to
[1:07:08] trust him and so what did David learn
[1:07:11] David learned that by music he could
[1:07:13] create the right atmosphere and the
[1:07:15] right atmosphere would produce faith and
[1:07:18] Faith would produce the
[1:07:20] Victory and so you find David singing
[1:07:23] songs and he would begin to sing for
[1:07:25] thou oh Lord are a shield for me you're
[1:07:29] the glory and the lifter up of mine
[1:07:33] head you go and read the psalm and he
[1:07:35] says many are they be increase that
[1:07:37] trouble me many there be which sa my
[1:07:38] soul there is no help for him and God
[1:07:40] say
[1:07:41] lie notice the words of the devil there
[1:07:45] are there is no help for me in God say l
[1:07:49] turn there Psalms 3 if you could just
[1:07:51] real quickly in the King James if you
[1:07:53] have your Bible I want you to turn
[1:07:58] there amen you love the Lord tonight I I
[1:08:02] want you to look at this and he says
[1:08:03] Lord this is a prayer here how are they
[1:08:06] increased that trouble me notice he's
[1:08:09] looking at numbers here how are they
[1:08:11] increased there there's so many they're
[1:08:14] overwhelming how many of us have prayed
[1:08:16] this in our own life Maybe not maybe you
[1:08:18] don't have to go and face a person with
[1:08:20] a shield and a sword and a chariot but
[1:08:22] you sometimes have to face impossible
[1:08:24] circumstances
[1:08:26] and situations that you know good and
[1:08:28] well that that there's no way that
[1:08:30] you're going to come out of this all
[1:08:31] right you know good and well that that
[1:08:34] left to your own demise left to your own
[1:08:36] it's going to be a demise and you know
[1:08:39] good and well what you're facing is
[1:08:40] impossible outside of the Lord coming in
[1:08:44] with mercy and intervening on your
[1:08:47] behalf and we've prayed this so many
[1:08:49] times Lord It's how how are they
[1:08:52] increase that trouble me many are they
[1:08:56] that rise up against me many there be
[1:09:00] which say of my soul there is no help
[1:09:02] for him in God say you know what the
[1:09:07] devil always tries to like to to put and
[1:09:11] and and and and and put over you
[1:09:13] constantly and be and listen let me say
[1:09:15] this here tonight I'm about to say
[1:09:16] something and and you're going to
[1:09:18] realize you're not the only one who who
[1:09:20] gets told this you know what the devil
[1:09:21] tells all of us it's
[1:09:23] hopeless ever had the will tell you that
[1:09:26] maybe not may maybe in a situation in
[1:09:28] your life and you
[1:09:30] say there there's just no way I mean
[1:09:33] I've tried I've given it my best shot
[1:09:36] but there's just no way it looks
[1:09:37] hopeless you know who loves hopelessness
[1:09:39] the enemy and the enemy loves nothing
[1:09:42] more than to get you in a mental state
[1:09:45] to where you believe your situation is
[1:09:48] hopeless but let me tell you something
[1:09:50] that's never hopeless with
[1:09:52] God he says many are they which r R up
[1:09:55] many are they how Lord how are they
[1:09:57] increase that trouble me many are they
[1:09:59] that rise up this is the enemy speaking
[1:10:02] here there is no help for human God say
[1:10:05] la David says but thou oh Lord are a
[1:10:11] shield for me my glory and the lifter up
[1:10:15] of mine
[1:10:16] head I cried now he begins to testify I
[1:10:20] Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he
[1:10:22] heard me out of his Holy Hill say I laid
[1:10:27] me down and slept I awake for the Lord
[1:10:30] sustained me and then he says I will not
[1:10:34] be afraid of 10, thousands of people
[1:10:37] that have set themselves against me
[1:10:39] round about and then he proclaims arise
[1:10:42] oh Lord save me oh my God for thou has
[1:10:46] smitten all my enemies upon the
[1:10:47] cheekbone thou has broken the teeth of
[1:10:50] the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the
[1:10:53] Lord thy bless in is upon thy people
[1:10:56] what was David doing he was using the
[1:10:59] words of God to take his impossible
[1:11:02] situation and he was using the words of
[1:11:04] God and it begin to create an atmosphere
[1:11:07] so that he could believe the word of God
[1:11:09] and before you can believe sometimes you
[1:11:11] need to create the right atmosphere to
[1:11:14] believe why do you think we sing songs
[1:11:16] in church before the preaching of the
[1:11:18] word of God because the word's going to
[1:11:20] come across and so we create an
[1:11:22] atmosphere where others can believe and
[1:11:24] say accept it because brother bam said
[1:11:27] all you have to do is accept it and once
[1:11:29] you accept it and it comes from here and
[1:11:31] drops to your heart there's nothing the
[1:11:33] devil can do
[1:11:35] then and so David I could imagine as he
[1:11:38] begin to play instrument that's why he
[1:11:40] begins to say praise him on the harp PR
[1:11:42] praise him on the the the drum praise
[1:11:44] him on the tambourine praise him on the
[1:11:46] timberl praise him with the snare and
[1:11:48] David what's he saying these M they're
[1:11:51] just musical instruments that's all they
[1:11:52] are but when you put that with those
[1:11:55] those musical instruments you you lace
[1:11:57] in the word of God then that becomes an
[1:12:00] atmosphere it becomes a power it becomes
[1:12:03] a faith I can imagine David many times
[1:12:06] uh taking all of his soldiers and
[1:12:08] Gathering them close and saying listen
[1:12:10] guys It seems impossible uh look how
[1:12:13] many are increased against us we're just
[1:12:14] a few there are many what are we going
[1:12:16] to do David here's what we're going to
[1:12:18] do pick up a pick up a a heart pick up a
[1:12:21] pick up a a string pick up a a drum pick
[1:12:23] up a snare what we going to do with that
[1:12:25] David we're going to start creating the
[1:12:27] right atmosphere and David begin to
[1:12:30] create the atmosphere and he begin to
[1:12:32] say many there be increase that trouble
[1:12:34] me but thou oh Lord are a shield for me
[1:12:39] you're the glory and the lifter up do
[1:12:42] you realize that something takes place
[1:12:44] when you declare with your mouth the
[1:12:47] word of God and you send that out to the
[1:12:50] atmosphere my brother whether you see it
[1:12:53] or not there is a spiritual Warfare
[1:12:55] taking place and Angelic soldiers and
[1:12:58] armies that God promised would be there
[1:13:00] to protect you are put on notice and
[1:13:03] aware and called to fight your battles
[1:13:06] you weren't called to fight your battles
[1:13:08] God was called to fight your battles all
[1:13:10] you got to do is praise Him worship Him
[1:13:12] and trust
[1:13:17] him all you got to do David says but
[1:13:20] Thou Art Lord but thou oh Lord are a
[1:13:23] shield for me my glory and the lifter up
[1:13:26] of my head Psalms 3 is just one example
[1:13:30] of many that we could use David knew the
[1:13:32] power of creating the right atmosphere
[1:13:36] of
[1:13:37] Faith because if you want to move out of
[1:13:39] the atmosphere of fear if you if if if
[1:13:42] you don't want to live in an if you want
[1:13:44] to live in an atmosphere of Faith you've
[1:13:46] got to move out of the atmosphere of
[1:13:48] fear say what is my atmosphere of fear
[1:13:50] whatever you're facing today that causes
[1:13:52] you fear anxiety worry move out of that
[1:13:55] atmosphere stop focusing on that and
[1:13:58] start focusing on what the word
[1:14:00] says that's why the Apostle Paul said
[1:14:02] let it pray without
[1:14:05] ceasing he says in another place let a
[1:14:07] song be upon your heart a melody in Your
[1:14:09] Heart A Hymn upon your lips why because
[1:14:13] it's created the right atmosphere and my
[1:14:15] brother and my sister you live in an
[1:14:18] atmosphere every single day you wake up
[1:14:20] you go out tomorrow you're going to go
[1:14:21] right back into this
[1:14:23] atmosphere but brother says something he
[1:14:25] says but you he says you can create a
[1:14:29] world and go live on
[1:14:32] it and some people are theorize that
[1:14:35] think oh I'm going to create you know
[1:14:36] some Planet over here I'm going to go no
[1:14:37] no no no how about create an atmosphere
[1:14:39] of love right here how about creating a
[1:14:42] world of faith and putting your family
[1:14:45] in that world and say yeah we're here
[1:14:48] but we're going to create an atmosphere
[1:14:49] where the where the holy spirit is
[1:14:51] welcome we're going to create an
[1:14:53] atmosphere in the midst of the calamity
[1:14:55] we're going to not speak words of doubt
[1:14:57] in our house we're going to speak words
[1:14:58] of Faith but it looks hopeless that
[1:15:00] doesn't matter but you've already got
[1:15:02] the report that doesn't matter I'm not
[1:15:03] going to speak those things I'm going to
[1:15:05] speak what the word of God says I'm
[1:15:07] going to create the right atmosphere and
[1:15:09] then leave the rest up to
[1:15:13] God you find even this kind of extreme
[1:15:16] Faith even in we we turn there in Samuel
[1:15:19] if you want to turn there look at this
[1:15:20] kind of Faith to face fear 1st Samuel
[1:15:23] chapter 14 this is is amazing when it
[1:15:25] speaks of this here in 1st Samuel
[1:15:27] chapter 14 and verse 1 uh brother uh
[1:15:30] brother Jeremy if you could put that up
[1:15:32] now it came to pass upon a day that
[1:15:35] Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the
[1:15:37] young man that bore his armor come and
[1:15:41] let us go over to the Philistines
[1:15:43] Garrison that is on the other side but
[1:15:46] he told not his father Notice come let
[1:15:51] us go unto the Garrison of the other
[1:15:54] side now here's Samuel and he's in a
[1:15:57] situation because if you go and you look
[1:15:59] this up uh there's the there's a there's
[1:16:02] a a complete state of paralysis taking
[1:16:07] place uh with
[1:16:09] Saul and the Philistines it's complete
[1:16:12] stalemate remember this morning we
[1:16:14] talked about response to fear would
[1:16:16] either be to fight or fight to be able
[1:16:18] to to run or to fight or with some you
[1:16:22] go into a state of paralysis where
[1:16:23] you're not doing anything you're just
[1:16:25] stuck you're you're you're you're you're
[1:16:28] you're completely uh Paralyzed by the
[1:16:31] situation well this is exactly what
[1:16:33] happens uh with with Saul there's a
[1:16:36] there's a stalemate nothing's taking
[1:16:38] place you have the Philistines
[1:16:40] garrisoned all over here you have Saul
[1:16:42] and his army Garrison over here and
[1:16:44] Saul's just over there waiting for a
[1:16:46] waiting for you know a prophet or word
[1:16:48] from the Lord not really knowing what to
[1:16:49] do he's sort of in stalemate doesn't
[1:16:51] really want to stick his neck out there
[1:16:52] is not too sure you it be sort of like
[1:16:55] if you ever seen the old scenes from the
[1:16:57] Civil War very similar you would have a
[1:17:00] an army no none of the armies stayed out
[1:17:02] no matter what you see uh on television
[1:17:04] none of the armies ever stayed out in
[1:17:06] the middle of the open in the plane just
[1:17:07] standing
[1:17:09] there they would all hide like we do
[1:17:11] today we cover ourselves with cover in
[1:17:14] the military they're always going to be
[1:17:15] behind cover they're always going to be
[1:17:16] behind something so that they don't take
[1:17:19] take enemy fire and so here was Saul's
[1:17:22] Army and they're garrisoned over here
[1:17:25] in this mountain and then here is here
[1:17:27] is uh the Philistines Garrison and there
[1:17:29] in this mountain and then in between
[1:17:32] this this great big field this great big
[1:17:35] plane and no one wants to come out first
[1:17:37] L they take enemy fire and get shot and
[1:17:41] so suddenly Jonathan has this idea and
[1:17:44] it came to pass Jonathan the son of Saul
[1:17:46] said unto the young man that bore his
[1:17:48] armor come and let us go to the
[1:17:51] Philistines Garrison that is on the
[1:17:54] other
[1:17:55] side but he told not his I'm going to
[1:17:57] I'm going to do a brother digs here I'm
[1:17:58] going to come down here is that all
[1:18:00] right he told not his father now I want
[1:18:03] you to notice this because this is
[1:18:05] amazing when you look at Faith this is
[1:18:07] the kind of faith that that that it took
[1:18:09] to fix the situation now notice what he
[1:18:12] says here now now now he gets this idea
[1:18:15] look what he says in verse six skip to
[1:18:17] verse six brother Jeremy he says and
[1:18:20] Jonathan said to the young man that bore
[1:18:22] his armor now notice what he says here
[1:18:24] he says come and let us go over unto the
[1:18:28] Garrison of the
[1:18:30] uncircumcised it may be that the Lord
[1:18:34] will work for
[1:18:39] us y'all didn't catch it if do you
[1:18:42] realize this is what he's literally
[1:18:43] saying he's saying Hey listen I got an
[1:18:46] idea all
[1:18:47] right now this is just an idea here you
[1:18:50] see we're here the arm's over there
[1:18:52] here's the field in the plane I've got
[1:18:54] this idea
[1:18:55] what is it what is it Jonathan listen
[1:18:57] has got this master plan we're going to
[1:19:00] go over to the other
[1:19:03] side okay a
[1:19:06] and and
[1:19:10] maybe the Lord will work for us do you
[1:19:14] realize what he's saying it may be
[1:19:16] that's that's our our our Southern word
[1:19:18] for maybe maybe you never know but maybe
[1:19:22] just maybe the Lord will work you right
[1:19:26] ready do you realize this is what
[1:19:29] Jonathan was saying let us go over to
[1:19:31] the other side maybe the Lord notice
[1:19:34] what he says for there is no restraint
[1:19:36] to the Lord to save by many my Dad's
[1:19:39] Army or by few just me and you and so it
[1:19:44] took this kind of Faith before someone
[1:19:47] in I hope you catch it here tonight
[1:19:49] before someone in the state of all the
[1:19:51] paralysis someone could have the faith
[1:19:53] to give God a chance to operate to give
[1:19:56] God the opportunity sometimes we never
[1:19:58] give the Lord a chance to make a move in
[1:20:01] our life we're out seeking advice from
[1:20:04] this person and this brother and this
[1:20:05] church over here and this Pro this thing
[1:20:07] we're we're get trying to figure
[1:20:09] everything out Google and
[1:20:12] everything and never giving the Lord an
[1:20:15] opportunity to move but Jonathan says it
[1:20:18] may
[1:20:20] be you know what that is that's faith
[1:20:23] that defeats fear
[1:20:27] here say brother Matt what happened all
[1:20:29] right let's find out verse seven and his
[1:20:31] armor Bearer said unto
[1:20:33] him do all that is in thy
[1:20:38] heart turn thee behold I am with thee
[1:20:43] according to thy heart I love that then
[1:20:46] said Jonathan behold we will pass over
[1:20:48] unto these men and we will discover
[1:20:50] ourselves unto them if they say if they
[1:20:52] if they thus say uh if if they say thus
[1:20:56] unto us T until we come to you then we
[1:20:58] will stand still in our place we will
[1:21:00] not go uh up unto them but if they say
[1:21:03] thus come up unto us then we will go up
[1:21:06] for the Lord hath delivered them into
[1:21:08] our hand and this shall be a sign unto
[1:21:09] us and both of them discovered
[1:21:11] themselves into the Garrison of the
[1:21:12] Philistines and the Philistines said
[1:21:14] behold the Hebrews come forth out of the
[1:21:15] holes that were the uh where they had
[1:21:18] hid themselves and the men of the
[1:21:19] Garrison answered Jonathan as Amor armor
[1:21:21] Bearer saying come up to us and we will
[1:21:23] show you a thing and Jonathan said unto
[1:21:25] his armor Bearer come up after me for
[1:21:27] the Lord hath delivered them into the
[1:21:30] hand of Israel and Jonathan climbed up
[1:21:34] upon his hands and upon his feet and his
[1:21:36] armor bear after him and they fell
[1:21:38] before Jonathan and his armor Bearer
[1:21:40] slew after him and that first Slaughter
[1:21:44] which Jonathan and his armor Bearer made
[1:21:46] was about 20 men within as it were a
[1:21:49] half acre of land which a yoke of oxen
[1:21:52] might plow
[1:21:54] small victory but it it broke the
[1:21:58] ice say what did it take it took one
[1:22:01] person to step out on faith it took one
[1:22:05] person to take a stand for the word of
[1:22:07] God and sometimes when you have to stand
[1:22:09] for the word of God you have to stand
[1:22:13] alone you have to stand alone and say
[1:22:16] I'm going to go with you you know what
[1:22:18] they did a actually a social experiment
[1:22:21] it was amazing and they they had an
[1:22:23] experiment where someone it was a it was
[1:22:26] a h a uh just a I don't even remember
[1:22:30] who what what school had put it on but
[1:22:33] they they identified how hard it was to
[1:22:36] not go with the flow to be odd to step
[1:22:38] out and so all of these children are in
[1:22:41] a line I forget what it was these
[1:22:43] college students and one one of the
[1:22:47] teenagers stepped outside and started
[1:22:50] doing this goofy dance of some kind it
[1:22:52] was just an article that I read started
[1:22:54] doing some kind of goofy uh uh dance and
[1:22:58] at first you know everybody looked at
[1:22:59] him and everybody's you know no one's
[1:23:01] moving and everyone's watching this guy
[1:23:03] and he's out there you know all by
[1:23:04] himself just stuck his neck right out
[1:23:06] there in front of hundreds we learned
[1:23:07] this morning what's the greatest fear
[1:23:08] public
[1:23:10] speaking when you have to single
[1:23:12] yourself out in the midst of a crowd let
[1:23:15] me show you that I'm going to use an
[1:23:17] example no I'm just kidding I'm not
[1:23:18] going to do
[1:23:19] that pass the mic
[1:23:22] around but this young man he stepped out
[1:23:25] he started doing this dance and and
[1:23:27] everyone you know at first was like this
[1:23:29] is really you know odd you know and they
[1:23:31] start snickering at the guy snickering
[1:23:33] at the guy and then you know what
[1:23:34] happens then a second person steps out
[1:23:37] of the line and he starts doing it with
[1:23:39] him that same dance you know what
[1:23:41] happens after that the floodgates open
[1:23:43] and the whole entire line starts doing
[1:23:44] this dance and they did an experiment
[1:23:46] they said who was it harder for who had
[1:23:49] more pressure you would say the man who
[1:23:52] stepped that originally but actually who
[1:23:53] had more pressure pressure was the
[1:23:55] second individual to follow the first
[1:23:58] cuz it takes more to stick to to it
[1:24:01] takes more pressure it's one thing for
[1:24:03] one person to do something it's another
[1:24:06] thing for another to step out and say
[1:24:08] I'll support you I'll get behind it I'll
[1:24:10] support
[1:24:12] it it's one thing for the preacher to
[1:24:15] have uh uh to be on fire for God it's
[1:24:17] another thing for you to catch that same
[1:24:20] fire it's one thing for one young person
[1:24:22] to get a Revival it's another thing for
[1:24:24] another person to say I'll stand with
[1:24:26] you I'll pray with you and you know what
[1:24:28] you start when you start you start
[1:24:30] Synergy you start uh you there's a fire
[1:24:33] a Revival fire spreads from one to the
[1:24:35] next to the next before you know it the
[1:24:36] whole church is on fire all because a
[1:24:39] couple people decided to have faith in
[1:24:42] God and and deny fear and not run from
[1:24:46] their fear but face Their Fear and stand
[1:24:48] for the promises of God's
[1:24:50] word cuz they because they stood out cuz
[1:24:53] they stood stood
[1:24:56] out amazing I had a brother with me and
[1:24:59] and he and he and he was we was in a
[1:25:01] vehicle and he's telling me this long
[1:25:03] testimony of this uh just this this
[1:25:06] thing that he had read in Genesis and it
[1:25:09] was something I forget what it was to do
[1:25:10] with Adam and something he had found in
[1:25:12] the New Testament it was just a
[1:25:13] wonderful thought just a brother there
[1:25:15] we was on our way to a church event and
[1:25:17] it was so good I mean it was just so
[1:25:21] good what he began to tell me about I
[1:25:22] was so blessed by it
[1:25:25] and so we get to the Gathering we get to
[1:25:26] the event and then we're all talking in
[1:25:29] the conversation and there's a bunch of
[1:25:31] people there a bunch of brothers and the
[1:25:33] conversation sort of turned reminded me
[1:25:34] I said oh brother I said tell everyone
[1:25:36] tell tell these brothers and boy when I
[1:25:38] said that I mean he immediately just
[1:25:40] flushed pale you know was like no
[1:25:43] brother man no no no I'm and I thought
[1:25:46] he didn't want to do I could tell he was
[1:25:48] scared I changed the subject really
[1:25:51] quick and I thought that really terrif
[1:25:53] now I thought that's odd we were in a
[1:25:55] vehicle it was just me and Hy had no
[1:25:57] problem expressing his thought
[1:25:59] articulating but then I put him in the
[1:26:00] in the in the room with a bunch of
[1:26:03] people suddenly paralysis doesn't want
[1:26:07] to speak doesn't want to say anything
[1:26:09] why is that why do you think and you
[1:26:11] know you said brother the matter are you
[1:26:13] uh uh are you susceptible absolutely you
[1:26:15] put me on the spot if I'm not preaching
[1:26:17] and I'm having to speak any one of us
[1:26:19] can get nervous in a
[1:26:20] moment but why do you think the devil if
[1:26:23] anything I'm I hope you catch this here
[1:26:26] tonight if anything the devil will try
[1:26:28] to suppress it's your
[1:26:31] voice if anything the devil will try to
[1:26:34] suppress in a young person no matter who
[1:26:37] it is if they're going to take a stand
[1:26:39] for God he'll try to clam them up to
[1:26:41] where they're so inward that they're
[1:26:43] they're they're they're so introverted
[1:26:45] they can't they can't step out and speak
[1:26:48] up but oh if just one could step out oh
[1:26:52] if just one of us could have faith all
[1:26:54] if one of us could just stand on the
[1:26:55] word of God if one of us could have sh
[1:26:57] the faith like Shadrach Meshach and
[1:26:59] abedo and say even if he doesn't I'm
[1:27:02] still not going to Bow oh what effect
[1:27:04] it'll have on the family of God what an
[1:27:06] effect it could have on your family your
[1:27:08] children your
[1:27:11] church for one to have faith and to
[1:27:14] stand up and
[1:27:16] speak fear is such a paralyzing thing
[1:27:20] brother bam said it I read it this
[1:27:21] morning it's the worst thing he said
[1:27:24] I've spent that the these nights trying
[1:27:26] to tell you fear is one of the worst
[1:27:28] things Satan can place upon a person is
[1:27:32] fear you say fear uh fear is fear is
[1:27:36] what fear of anything I don't care what
[1:27:38] you want to name here tonight and this
[1:27:40] world that we live in more than any
[1:27:43] other age men's hearts are failing them
[1:27:46] for fear friend I I hope it's not be
[1:27:50] honest and transparent here tonight and
[1:27:52] tell you and say to you I B
[1:27:56] fear all of us no matter what it is uh
[1:28:00] my what my what I'm afraid of is
[1:28:02] different than what you're afraid of and
[1:28:05] what may cause me uh uh uh uh worry may
[1:28:09] not cause you any worry at all but what
[1:28:10] may cause you worry May uh may not
[1:28:13] bother me one
[1:28:15] bit and we're all susceptible to this I
[1:28:19] think it's amazing in Matthew chapter 10
[1:28:22] this is just powerful to me
[1:28:24] Matthew chapter 10 and verse 28 I want
[1:28:27] you to read here and then I'm going to
[1:28:28] read from Luke also but I want you to
[1:28:31] look at this because I believe that
[1:28:33] there's something so important out of
[1:28:35] what Jesus says here very familiar
[1:28:38] scripture but in Matthew chapter 10 and
[1:28:40] verse 28 if you could pull that up
[1:28:43] brother Jeremy on the screen and display
[1:28:45] that here Jesus is going to begin to
[1:28:48] talk about this uh this example here of
[1:28:52] sparrows notice what he says and he says
[1:28:55] and fear he says and and fear not them
[1:28:59] which kill the body but are not able to
[1:29:01] kill the soul but rather film that which
[1:29:02] is able to destroy both soul and Body in
[1:29:05] Hell verse
[1:29:06] 29 and he says and not Two Sparrows he
[1:29:10] says are not Two Sparrows sold for a
[1:29:13] farthing now this is if I've if I've
[1:29:16] gotten this correct it's about it's
[1:29:18] worth about two pennies about two
[1:29:21] pennies say what would that mean not not
[1:29:24] very
[1:29:25] much how much value do you put on it
[1:29:28] well two
[1:29:29] pennies you know you see you see a penny
[1:29:32] laying on the ground uh you know how
[1:29:34] much trouble would you go through maybe
[1:29:36] if it was right there but how much
[1:29:38] trouble would you go through to to to to
[1:29:40] to get two pennies Jesus says now notice
[1:29:44] this he says are not two far thingss are
[1:29:47] not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing and
[1:29:49] one of them one of them just one shall
[1:29:53] not fall fall on the ground means
[1:29:56] die without your
[1:29:59] father not
[1:30:01] one Jesus says not one not one Sparrow
[1:30:06] even
[1:30:07] though when you look at Value is not
[1:30:10] worth a lot yet they shall not fall on
[1:30:12] the ground without your father verse 30
[1:30:17] and he says but and he he immediately
[1:30:19] goes to you and says but the very hairs
[1:30:24] of your head are all
[1:30:28] numbered the very hairs of your hair of
[1:30:31] your head are all numbers even even
[1:30:36] David would boast of this and David
[1:30:38] would say Heath delivered me from all my
[1:30:41] fears he have delivered me so what was
[1:30:44] David saying he says I've I've I've
[1:30:46] obtained something he's delivered me
[1:30:48] I've came to this place of victory in my
[1:30:50] life I don't fear anything anymore if
[1:30:51] you go back and study how David was
[1:30:53] delivered from all of his fears it was
[1:30:55] always because he was magnifying how
[1:30:58] great God
[1:31:00] is and David found Victory from Fear by
[1:31:04] magnifying how awesome the Lord is when
[1:31:07] David had his eyes on the Creator then
[1:31:11] nothing seemed
[1:31:13] impossible when David kept his eyes and
[1:31:15] on how big God is then it didn't seem
[1:31:17] like his problem was all that
[1:31:20] big thought this was so interesting here
[1:31:23] when when you look at this sparrows and
[1:31:25] Jesus mentions in verse
[1:31:27] 29 there are 9,000 and this may stand
[1:31:31] correction just from research and and
[1:31:33] and a little article that I had
[1:31:35] read There are
[1:31:37] 9,000 species of birds approximately
[1:31:41] species of birds and out of all
[1:31:45] 9,000 Jesus could have referred to any
[1:31:48] he refers to one the sparrow and and if
[1:31:51] you look in in America just in iron
[1:31:54] there's 35 different kinds of
[1:31:58] sparrows but in Jesus's day this term
[1:32:01] Sparrow it's talking about a small land
[1:32:04] bird and these birds were caught very
[1:32:06] differently than they take birds today
[1:32:08] with a shotgun but back then they would
[1:32:10] trap them with little ground traps as
[1:32:13] they would go to to get things to build
[1:32:15] their nest they would have a trap and it
[1:32:17] would be caught in a snare but the the
[1:32:20] these birds uh these these sparrows
[1:32:24] how you recognize them for their music
[1:32:27] and and some of them sing as many as 22
[1:32:31] different
[1:32:32] Tunes sparrows and Larks and Vesper
[1:32:35] sparrows I'm not a uh by no means know
[1:32:37] that much about birds just from this
[1:32:39] that I've read so if you got any bird
[1:32:41] watchers in here someone who knows a lot
[1:32:42] you could correct me afterwards but
[1:32:45] Vesper sparrows white-throated sparrows
[1:32:48] all of them having names to do with
[1:32:51] music and sparrows like all birds like
[1:32:55] all of God's creation is intricately
[1:32:59] designed and
[1:33:02] made God doesn't do anything by accident
[1:33:06] and he doesn't design anything without a
[1:33:09] purpose they the the Bible says you are
[1:33:11] fearfully and wonderfully
[1:33:14] made
[1:33:16] right and so these birds here uh uh they
[1:33:22] they they're thin small bones thin very
[1:33:25] thin very very small bones but are
[1:33:28] strong and they're equipped specifically
[1:33:31] for flying even today in modern science
[1:33:34] they can't replicate the the the the
[1:33:38] intricacy of the wings of a sparrow or
[1:33:41] the the wing system that allows them to
[1:33:43] migrate you know thousands of miles they
[1:33:46] have no no no way to reproduce that and
[1:33:49] so each each Sparrow has anywhere from
[1:33:53] 1, 1300 to
[1:33:56] 2600
[1:33:58] feathers and and they're detailed
[1:34:01] detailed ever seen a bird that's died
[1:34:04] and you and you go through that you you
[1:34:06] look at the the just the the
[1:34:09] beauty of that bird that's why the
[1:34:12] songwriter wrote How Great Thou
[1:34:15] Art how how great when I when I survey
[1:34:18] when I look at God's creation I I say
[1:34:21] How Great Thou Art intricately and
[1:34:23] designed uh designed perfectly every
[1:34:26] bone every feather their wing system and
[1:34:30] God counted every single
[1:34:35] bird each one it's what Jesus says your
[1:34:41] father not one of them even is what you
[1:34:44] would call valueless yet not one of them
[1:34:46] has hit the ground without your father
[1:34:50] knowing not one of them he counted every
[1:34:54] single one of them most of those birds
[1:34:56] as we said uh uh were were trapped
[1:35:00] trapped with Nets and they would they
[1:35:02] would they would trap them and in
[1:35:03] Jerusalem Jesus is using this example
[1:35:07] because this was a common practice he
[1:35:08] sees sparrows being sold uh and and and
[1:35:12] and and even just for such a small value
[1:35:14] these birds that have been trapped with
[1:35:17] trip Nets and and out of all of these
[1:35:20] birds that looked like they had no
[1:35:22] purpose other than just to be trapped
[1:35:24] and to be sold and to be ate yet Jesus
[1:35:27] says I want you to know something about
[1:35:29] you and before I talk about you I want
[1:35:31] to talk about something you think is so
[1:35:34] valueless because if I value the sparrow
[1:35:37] that much how much more do I value
[1:35:40] you in so much that I've not only know
[1:35:44] the sparrow I've numbered the
[1:35:47] hairs on your
[1:35:49] head imagine that
[1:35:54] even
[1:35:56] hair such an amazing
[1:35:58] subject every hair Jesus says he's
[1:36:02] numbered every single hair now between
[1:36:07] 100,000 and 15,000
[1:36:11] hairs are on the human head the normal
[1:36:14] human head now I know some of you don't
[1:36:16] have as many hairs as
[1:36:18] others and that number is way shy of
[1:36:21] 100,000
[1:36:24] but
[1:36:27] originally there was a 100,000 to
[1:36:30] 150,000 hairs on the human head even
[1:36:35] those it's amazing because even those
[1:36:37] who are bald uh or balding or have went
[1:36:40] bald still have the the the the the
[1:36:43] system and on their head on their head
[1:36:47] that produces hair even though it's
[1:36:49] unseen by the human eye there's tiny
[1:36:52] follicles tiny small little follicles
[1:36:54] hair follicles and so God God doesn't
[1:36:57] just create hair for looks but he makes
[1:36:59] hair very useful and it's not just for
[1:37:01] the sake as we said of a of of
[1:37:03] appearance but our hair on our head is
[1:37:06] for insulation during the summer and the
[1:37:09] winter even your eyebrows that you have
[1:37:12] have a purpose and they're to keep sweat
[1:37:15] as you begin to prirate the eyebrows are
[1:37:18] there as a guard to keep sweat from
[1:37:20] going into your eyes your eyelashes go
[1:37:23] fur further than that and they protect
[1:37:25] your eyelids from dusts and and little
[1:37:28] tiny insects or something that would fly
[1:37:30] in your eyes God
[1:37:32] intricately and very detail oriented
[1:37:35] created you and everything has a
[1:37:40] purpose and and and even the tiny hairs
[1:37:43] in your ears which are much less tiny on
[1:37:46] some than others and nostrils hairs in
[1:37:49] your ears and hairs in your
[1:37:52] nostrils uh they there to filter
[1:37:54] incoming particles or things that that
[1:37:56] that are uh you know uh bacterias or
[1:37:59] things and so what God does is he makes
[1:38:02] um he doesn't just take hair but he
[1:38:04] makes a marvelous intricate system of
[1:38:10] protection and and any even even the
[1:38:14] every hair you take just the individual
[1:38:17] hair and you were just to take an
[1:38:18] individual hair and put it on a
[1:38:20] microscope it's a cylinder of cells
[1:38:24] uh that that tunnel Deep Way deep into
[1:38:27] the into the skin beyond the skin down
[1:38:30] into the to the blood vessels that
[1:38:32] nourish each and every single hair on
[1:38:35] your head and every hair has muscle
[1:38:39] nerves and glands if you even touch
[1:38:42] lightly the top of your head your hairs
[1:38:45] will alert the nerves will the the
[1:38:47] nerves will alert your brain and you
[1:38:50] know what you feel it
[1:38:53] what is it God made you that
[1:38:56] way even in if you look at a drawing of
[1:38:59] a single human hair you're going to see
[1:39:01] a section A crosssection with many
[1:39:04] different rings and these rings of
[1:39:06] tissue uh that surround the trunk which
[1:39:08] is surrounded by nerve collar and and it
[1:39:11] maintains the cuticle and and it and
[1:39:14] it's just what you say brother Matt what
[1:39:16] are you trying to say I'm trying to say
[1:39:17] that we serve an awesome God who did
[1:39:21] nothing by chance or by happen stand but
[1:39:23] he created you very specifically in a
[1:39:25] certain
[1:39:27] way even the color the melanin that
[1:39:30] produces the hair's color it's deposited
[1:39:32] in growing hair and so God puts a color
[1:39:36] a tinning Factory right on your head and
[1:39:40] and and and and and and if a hair is
[1:39:42] left alone it could grow up to 25 feet
[1:39:45] long in a lifetime
[1:39:47] 25 ft
[1:39:51] long now you know why David says I am
[1:39:55] fearfully and
[1:39:57] wonderfully
[1:39:59] made now you know why the Bible says
[1:40:02] your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:05] that's why we don't Mar our bodies with
[1:40:07] tattoos or
[1:40:09] piercings it's the Temple of the Holy
[1:40:12] Ghost we don't we don't abuse our
[1:40:16] body
[1:40:18] right even you know I know uh the Bible
[1:40:21] says you know physical people people say
[1:40:23] well physical exercise well exercise is
[1:40:25] good for the
[1:40:26] body and people that Creek say well Paul
[1:40:28] said it profiteth little well still a
[1:40:35] little and so it's it's to be taken care
[1:40:38] of God gave it to you you ought to take
[1:40:40] care of
[1:40:42] it I don't know where that came from so
[1:40:44] that's for
[1:40:47] free but in the notice here Jesus is
[1:40:50] speaking here in Matthew 10 and he
[1:40:52] begins to talk about two things
[1:40:55] sparrows and
[1:40:57] hair that The Sparrows not one of them
[1:41:00] fall to the ground without your father
[1:41:01] know and the Very hairs you know those
[1:41:04] intricate things we just learned about
[1:41:06] every single one has a
[1:41:09] number that's what Jesus says he's
[1:41:12] trying to get them to understand
[1:41:14] something he's trying to get them to
[1:41:16] understand what it means when he says
[1:41:18] that he's allowed us he's enabled us to
[1:41:20] serve him without fear
[1:41:24] all the days of our life God never
[1:41:26] created you to live on this Earth to
[1:41:28] live in constant anxiety and fear
[1:41:33] never if anything brother bam says fear
[1:41:36] is something Satan puts on you like a
[1:41:39] coat like a cloak like a
[1:41:41] chain it's something he puts on you and
[1:41:45] so he says now notice right before this
[1:41:48] this verse fear not this is what he says
[1:41:51] his very words in verse 28 and fear fear
[1:41:53] not them which kill the body but are not
[1:41:56] able to kill the soul but rather fear
[1:41:57] him which is able to destroy both soul
[1:41:59] and body and hell then he goes to talk
[1:42:01] about this fear and he says are there
[1:42:03] not Two Sparrows and not worth much sold
[1:42:07] but your father knows about every single
[1:42:08] one of them and the hairs the very hairs
[1:42:12] on your head notice what Colossians 1
[1:42:15] Colossians chapter 1 verse 16
[1:42:20] says for by him
[1:42:23] were all things created Colossians 1:16
[1:42:27] for by him were all things created that
[1:42:30] are in heaven and that are in the
[1:42:33] earth all things were created by Him and
[1:42:37] for him and he is before all things and
[1:42:41] by him all things
[1:42:45] consists all things are held up all
[1:42:48] things are gelled together all things by
[1:42:54] him you imagine if Jesus could have
[1:42:57] said yeah I'm the one who created the
[1:43:00] feathers on that Sparrow I'm the one who
[1:43:03] designed the wing structure I'm the one
[1:43:06] who designed the hair on your head and
[1:43:08] it wasn't Jesus was who was Jesus his
[1:43:10] occupation was a carpenter as a man but
[1:43:14] he was more than a man he was God and as
[1:43:16] the Creator he was saying no man could
[1:43:19] do this no scientist could do this but
[1:43:21] the creator of Heaven heavens and earth
[1:43:24] designed you created you built you so
[1:43:28] why fear anything in your
[1:43:31] life this is exactly what he's saying
[1:43:34] Peter what if Jesus you know
[1:43:36] Jesus Jesus could have looked over to
[1:43:38] Peter and said Peter I know you're
[1:43:39] fearful but let me let me just tell you
[1:43:41] something Peter what if I told you that
[1:43:43] you
[1:43:44] have
[1:43:46] 127,000 364
[1:43:49] hairs on your head you have 16 three in
[1:43:53] your right eyebrow you have 160 in your
[1:43:57] left eyebrow you have you have 25
[1:43:59] eyelashes in the left eye you have 23 in
[1:44:02] this eye you have you have 319 over here
[1:44:05] your beard Peter it's made up of
[1:44:23] many on your head you have this many on
[1:44:24] your eyebrow you have this many now
[1:44:26] since you know Peter that I've numbered
[1:44:28] every hair on your head won't you trust
[1:44:31] me then with every single little detail
[1:44:35] of your
[1:44:38] life W you believe that I don't know
[1:44:42] just the big choices I'm not just there
[1:44:44] for the big times I'm there for the
[1:44:46] little moments in your life in fact the
[1:44:49] Bible says the footsteps of the
[1:44:51] righteous are ordered of the
[1:44:55] Lord you know what that means the
[1:44:57] footsteps every step you take righteous
[1:45:01] steps are ordered of the Lord that means
[1:45:04] he called them he ordained them he
[1:45:07] provisioned them he purposed them every
[1:45:11] single step you know what that includes
[1:45:15] my last
[1:45:17] one that's why David could say that God
[1:45:20] knows you show me how how how he says
[1:45:23] teach me to number my days in other
[1:45:25] words God you've numbered every single
[1:45:26] day I have here on this Earth You know
[1:45:29] every
[1:45:30] day someone passes away and you say I
[1:45:32] don't understand but God
[1:45:35] does if God ordered all their steps in
[1:45:38] life don't you trust in that he ordered
[1:45:39] their last
[1:45:42] one he says Peter I've I've ordered
[1:45:45] every every aspect every detail every
[1:45:49] intricate detail every step James do you
[1:45:52] understand man uh you know uh did you
[1:45:55] know there's
[1:45:57] 2,396 65 sparrows on the Earth right now
[1:46:01] as of yesterday that's the count in the
[1:46:03] last 24 hours uh 24 uh 2, 440,000 of
[1:46:09] them uh H H have died by natural death
[1:46:12] and 9 million and however many are
[1:46:14] trapped in a trap right now you know
[1:46:17] Jesus could say that he knew exactly how
[1:46:20] many he knew the exact number the exact
[1:46:24] detail why why was he so why not just a
[1:46:27] generic number because he was trying to
[1:46:28] teach them
[1:46:32] something I've I've enabled you to serve
[1:46:35] me without any fear or
[1:46:39] worry and I say Lord let me serve you
[1:46:42] that
[1:46:43] way let me live all of this days how
[1:46:46] many could say that let me live all the
[1:46:48] days of my
[1:46:49] life without fear because Jesus says not
[1:46:53] one of them falls to the ground without
[1:46:55] your father in Heaven's knowledge not
[1:46:57] one of them falls to the ground so be
[1:47:01] careful for nothing that's what the
[1:47:03] scripture says don't be anxious for
[1:47:05] anything the Bible says don't be anxious
[1:47:08] for anything but with prayer and
[1:47:10] supplication make your request known
[1:47:12] unto God not with fear not with worry
[1:47:15] not with anxiety with prayer and
[1:47:17] supplication make your request known to
[1:47:21] God
[1:47:24] will you now believe me that I promise
[1:47:27] to clothe you I promise to feed you I
[1:47:29] promise to put a roof over your
[1:47:31] head I promise to take care of every
[1:47:33] single detail will you trust me will you
[1:47:36] trust me in every every decision and
[1:47:39] every time and every purpose in your
[1:47:42] life not just the good
[1:47:45] times it's so easy so easy so easy man
[1:47:50] the times are good things are happening
[1:47:52] things make
[1:47:54] sense so sweet to trust in
[1:47:59] Jesus just to take him at his word but
[1:48:03] let the times get
[1:48:04] rough start having questions pop up and
[1:48:07] why this and why that and suddenly it's
[1:48:09] so much harder times of your life I
[1:48:13] think of and I'm going to close here I
[1:48:16] think of
[1:48:17] josaphat King Jehosaphat in his life it
[1:48:21] was so amazing because you take take
[1:48:23] this this man who was the
[1:48:26] Bible Mo for the most part talks about
[1:48:29] Jehoshaphat as a as a Godly King and
[1:48:32] he's son of a son of Asa and the Bible
[1:48:35] begins to to tell about this situation
[1:48:38] that arises in his life and the
[1:48:41] scripture says here that Jehoshaphat
[1:48:45] that there's this great and new this
[1:48:47] great Army that teams up against him and
[1:48:51] and they're there to to to to a a great
[1:48:54] Alliance I think it was five uh kingdoms
[1:48:57] let me just pull it up here on my screen
[1:48:58] in the scripture here think it was five
[1:49:01] kingdoms that made an alliance against
[1:49:04] him and it was amazing
[1:49:07] because let let me let me find here in
[1:49:10] in in chapter 20 you don't have to turn
[1:49:12] 2 Chronicles chapter 20 you you can turn
[1:49:14] you can put it on the screen if you have
[1:49:15] your Bible you can turn but he
[1:49:18] Jehoshaphat is a a Godly Man Who d
[1:49:22] destroys a lot of the asteroth poles and
[1:49:25] and he does a lot of cleaning up in
[1:49:28] Israel but he makes a big mistake a huge
[1:49:31] mistake and he made this mistake over
[1:49:33] and over in his life a few times in his
[1:49:36] life because he was a sympathetic man he
[1:49:38] was so sympathetic to the northern
[1:49:41] kingdom and the Kings though they were
[1:49:42] evil wicked men he was always trying to
[1:49:45] to send out an olive branch always
[1:49:46] trying to reach out you study the life
[1:49:49] of Jehoshaphat always trying to reach
[1:49:52] out and and to be open and to be
[1:49:54] diplomatic but it got him in
[1:49:56] trouble and he he makes uh Ahab you know
[1:50:00] the story really well from Sunday school
[1:50:03] I'm sure Ahab wants to uh attack and he
[1:50:06] and he to attack I think it was Syria
[1:50:09] and he and he invites Jehoshaphat and to
[1:50:12] come in and make an alliance and we're
[1:50:14] going to team up and we're gonna we're
[1:50:15] going to take out the syrians and and
[1:50:18] and so you know
[1:50:19] he Jehoshaphat says well you know should
[1:50:22] we cons a prophet and so he brings in
[1:50:24] these 400 prophets and you know they're
[1:50:26] all prophesying and and Jehoshaphat says
[1:50:28] is there is there not a real a true
[1:50:31] prophet in the land and he says oh yeah
[1:50:33] there's you know there's this one but he
[1:50:35] always prophesies against me and you
[1:50:37] know the story of MAA oh you go to the
[1:50:39] end of that story and even after the
[1:50:42] prophet's warning even after jeos or or
[1:50:45] Mah prophesize and he gives just what he
[1:50:48] basically tells Ahab what he wants to
[1:50:50] hear and then Ahab says you know how you
[1:50:52] you know you got to tell me the truth uh
[1:50:54] speak the truth and he says I've seen
[1:50:56] Israel scattered like sheep and even
[1:50:58] though he had given him the warning not
[1:51:00] to go yet somehow through his maybe I
[1:51:03] don't know through his maybe I'm adding
[1:51:05] here but his kindness uh uh his
[1:51:07] benevolence just wanting to be uh to
[1:51:10] have to have an open door here with this
[1:51:12] King he teams up with him and God
[1:51:15] rebukes him and so he makes this
[1:51:18] Alliance now you say brother mat why is
[1:51:20] this story important because josaphat's
[1:51:23] life had been a life that had been
[1:51:24] trusting God for everything trusting the
[1:51:27] Lord for every decision in his life but
[1:51:30] he makes this mistake and we know even
[1:51:32] further than that he he he marries has
[1:51:35] his son Mary the daughter of Ahab and
[1:51:37] Jezebel but now one morning Jehoshaphat
[1:51:41] the Bible says is is woken up and he
[1:51:44] says in verse one and and he gets this
[1:51:47] bad terrible news and in 2 Chronicles 20
[1:51:51] and verse one
[1:51:53] the news comes to him as no doubt as his
[1:51:57] his uh the Bible says maybe his military
[1:51:59] soldiers or whoever it was his captains
[1:52:01] and Generals wakes him up and says
[1:52:04] Jehoshaphat he says it came to pass
[1:52:06] after this also the children of his Moab
[1:52:08] and the children of Amon and with them
[1:52:10] other besides the ammonites came against
[1:52:12] Jehoshaphat to battle and so he says in
[1:52:15] verse two Then There came some that told
[1:52:17] Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great
[1:52:20] multitude against thee from Beyond the
[1:52:22] Sea on the side of Syria on on this side
[1:52:24] Syria and behold how they be in ha Tomar
[1:52:27] which is in Getty and so notice he gets
[1:52:31] this bad
[1:52:33] news this great Alliance as it were is
[1:52:38] is coming to wipe him out now it's it's
[1:52:41] he's reaping what he's reaping the
[1:52:43] results of a really bad
[1:52:46] decision and sometimes our actions are
[1:52:50] reaping the results of a really bad
[1:52:52] decision
[1:52:54] but now he's he's he gets this news and
[1:52:57] there's these team of
[1:52:59] Alliance and Jehoshaphat they're 15
[1:53:02] miles
[1:53:03] away they're just 15 miles they're just
[1:53:07] they're right on our our doorstep just
[1:53:09] 15 miles south of Jerusalem what are you
[1:53:12] going to do what do we do they're on the
[1:53:15] western
[1:53:16] shore of the Dead Sea what are we going
[1:53:19] to do Jehoshaphat imagine these leaders
[1:53:22] in and these generals who had trusted
[1:53:26] him it it seemed hopeless we're going to
[1:53:30] be wiped out it's not a
[1:53:32] chance I mean it what what chance do we
[1:53:35] have it's it's Extinction imagine being
[1:53:37] woken up with this kind of news they're
[1:53:39] coming to destroy
[1:53:41] us coming an our army innumerable you
[1:53:45] know what Jehoshaphat had right then he
[1:53:49] had a reason to panic
[1:53:53] and he had a reason to start pushing
[1:53:55] Panic
[1:53:57] buttons you know what those are don't
[1:54:00] you had a reason to start pushing Panic
[1:54:03] buttons and start trying to figure it
[1:54:06] out find out what what what what what
[1:54:08] are you going to do what what's going to
[1:54:10] happen the verse three notice what it
[1:54:12] says and Jehoshaphat
[1:54:15] feared and set himself means he
[1:54:19] determined he set himself to seek the
[1:54:21] Lord and proclaimed to fast throughout
[1:54:25] all
[1:54:26] Judah you know what you know what you
[1:54:29] say brother Matt what do we do in times
[1:54:31] of Calamity in times of Crisis now let
[1:54:34] me just let me just give me just can I
[1:54:36] just have about five more minutes here
[1:54:37] this is what the Lord put upon my heart
[1:54:40] and Times of Calamity times of
[1:54:43] Crisis you say brother Matt what should
[1:54:45] the believer
[1:54:46] do what what what what would your answer
[1:54:49] be pray right be the natural answer for
[1:54:53] the Christian and of course that's what
[1:54:56] all Christians do
[1:55:01] right the natural answer you say what
[1:55:04] does the word say uh we have a great
[1:55:06] need it's a great Calamity of a great
[1:55:09] problem oh it's so it says David said
[1:55:11] that's increased against me it's seems
[1:55:15] impossible what should it do it should
[1:55:17] drive us to our knees it should drive us
[1:55:19] to do exactly what Jehoshaphat did to
[1:55:22] seek the
[1:55:24] Lord and Proclaim to fast throughout all
[1:55:29] Judah you say brother Matt what is that
[1:55:31] that's the obvious answer you should
[1:55:33] pray but it's not the automatic
[1:55:36] response in fact if we'd be honest sadly
[1:55:39] most of the time it's not our response
[1:55:43] our first
[1:55:45] response we
[1:55:48] Panic it's amazing because I could say
[1:55:52] it would have been very human it would
[1:55:55] have been very understandable for
[1:55:57] Jehoshaphat to hear this news this
[1:55:59] enemies on your border they're coming to
[1:56:01] wipe us out and it would have been
[1:56:03] natural to hear Jehoshaphat say uh uh
[1:56:07] call all the generals call all my
[1:56:10] generals get them in in the war room in
[1:56:11] here let's get in the situation room and
[1:56:14] we're going to figure this out and
[1:56:15] what's our intelligence tell us give me
[1:56:16] the latest where they at right now how
[1:56:19] many tanks do we have how many jets do
[1:56:20] we have how many bombs do we have what's
[1:56:22] you know what's our what's our rations
[1:56:24] at right now let's try to figure this
[1:56:25] out guys that would have been very
[1:56:28] normal get immobilized immediately let's
[1:56:32] let's set up uh uh stations we don't
[1:56:34] have one second 15 miles we don't have
[1:56:36] one second to
[1:56:38] waste and as soon as as soon as Johan
[1:56:42] fat would sent him out you know and
[1:56:43] let's get out there let's get on the
[1:56:44] front lines and oh oh oh and by the way
[1:56:47] if you guys find time to pray we
[1:56:49] probably should pray
[1:56:50] too if you guys if we find time when you
[1:56:52] get all set up and you do all that may
[1:56:54] you know that's how we react so many
[1:56:57] times we set up our army we make all of
[1:57:00] our plans we get everything ready we get
[1:57:02] our
[1:57:03] defenses and then we go now Lord will
[1:57:06] you help
[1:57:09] me what if that was the first thing we
[1:57:12] did what if this was the first thing we
[1:57:18] did Jehoshaphat rather than doing the
[1:57:21] natural thing
[1:57:23] Jehoshaphat calls the whole nation calls
[1:57:26] everybody and he proclaims a fast
[1:57:29] throughout the whole church the whole
[1:57:31] nation the problem is great Panic would
[1:57:34] have been
[1:57:35] normal but it says in verse now now
[1:57:38] what's even more amazing go back to
[1:57:40] verse one brother Jeremy this is what's
[1:57:42] more amazing about this in verse one it
[1:57:44] says it came to pass after this also
[1:57:47] after
[1:57:49] what now here's here's the here's the
[1:57:51] latter an army of multiple kings are
[1:57:54] coming to wipe you and sin and no
[1:57:57] actually it's quite the opposite you go
[1:57:59] and read chapter 191
[1:58:01] 1817 this is after Jehoshaphat cleans
[1:58:06] house kicks the trash
[1:58:07] out and and begins to make great
[1:58:10] reformations to Israel this is what
[1:58:12] happens right after you say I don't
[1:58:16] deserve this you know how many times
[1:58:17] that's our answer in our heart whether
[1:58:19] we say it with our mouth what did I do
[1:58:21] to deserve this this Lord what did I
[1:58:23] ever do to deserve this what did Paul
[1:58:25] and Silas do to deserve to be in a
[1:58:27] prison chained up to chains in the inner
[1:58:30] dungeon as Roman citizens you know what
[1:58:33] they could have said if anybody could
[1:58:35] have said we don't deserve this it's
[1:58:37] Paul and Silas but you know what Paul
[1:58:39] and Silas didn't do they never said that
[1:58:41] they begin to sing and praise
[1:58:46] God after this it came to pass after
[1:58:50] this after Jas fat tried to do something
[1:58:54] for God tried to bring the nation it
[1:58:56] would have been very natural for him to
[1:58:58] get bitter for him to get angry and say
[1:59:00] Lord this is how you repay
[1:59:02] me after I've set my heart to seek you
[1:59:05] after I've after I've tried to to do
[1:59:08] something for you and now we're on the
[1:59:10] brink of being wiped out but you know
[1:59:12] what josaphat he didn't do that he
[1:59:15] didn't do what was automatic in a
[1:59:18] crisis he prayed
[1:59:22] I know it's very simple but I hope it's
[1:59:24] dealing with your heart here
[1:59:26] tonight he prayed it had been natural to
[1:59:30] trust his resources but he didn't he
[1:59:32] trusted God it had been natural to look
[1:59:34] to armies but he didn't he looked to the
[1:59:37] word he did what was what what was not
[1:59:41] automatic what was obvious but not
[1:59:42] automatic he gets down to his knees you
[1:59:46] go read chapter 17 through through 19 it
[1:59:49] tells about the might the power of all
[1:59:51] of his for forces that he had was
[1:59:53] equipped for war that he had accumulated
[1:59:55] it had been easy get get ready get
[1:59:57] prepared get let's go after them but
[2:00:00] rather than trust in his army rather
[2:00:02] than trust in his army now I tell you
[2:00:04] another thing he didn't do it would have
[2:00:06] been very he would have been very
[2:00:07] susceptible as a
[2:00:09] leader as a
[2:00:10] king pride gets in the way dignity gets
[2:00:14] in the way and what you say privately
[2:00:17] you maybe don't say
[2:00:20] publicly because you got the image
[2:00:23] right it would have been very rather
[2:00:26] than trust in his army Jehoshaphat
[2:00:29] publicly makes an
[2:00:32] admission and what's he admitting a lack
[2:00:35] of strength a lack not strength but a
[2:00:38] lack of strength not ability but a lack
[2:00:41] of ability and he calls on God to help
[2:00:44] him in this time of Crisis Jehoshaphat
[2:00:47] here he was the king of all of Judah and
[2:00:50] and and and and this was this was a
[2:00:52] prideful thing to be a king and to to to
[2:00:55] be put in this position it was he had
[2:00:57] some dignity there was an image to go
[2:00:59] with it and it was to there's a reason
[2:01:02] for that it's important leaders Inspire
[2:01:04] confidence by their confidence you
[2:01:07] inspire other people by your so by your
[2:01:09] uh Resolute attitude you inspire others
[2:01:13] it had been natural for Jehoshaphat to
[2:01:15] be proud and say well I can't surely I
[2:01:18] can't say that to my whole church I I I
[2:01:21] can't I can't show that type of
[2:01:23] transparency I can't show that type of
[2:01:27] weakness you know sometimes people
[2:01:29] appreciate that more than
[2:01:32] strength I appreciate God's Prophet when
[2:01:35] he would make humble admissions of his
[2:01:37] own faults and his own mistakes and his
[2:01:39] own failures how far away I would feel
[2:01:42] if we had a prophet who came and just
[2:01:44] told us how all the time he was just
[2:01:46] never made a mistake never but no he
[2:01:48] goes on further to tell us he told a
[2:01:50] lie he got in a car with a gun to go
[2:01:52] kill another man his temper got the best
[2:01:55] of him I know people don't like to talk
[2:01:57] about that but it's
[2:01:59] important because it gives you Faith to
[2:02:01] believe if God used him God could use
[2:02:06] me if God could if God could look past
[2:02:09] God could look past
[2:02:12] here what kind of leader what kind of
[2:02:15] strong leader gets up and admits before
[2:02:17] his whole church we're helpless
[2:02:22] we're helpless I'll just be honest today
[2:02:25] friends uh we we don't have no
[2:02:27] answers could you imagine we have no
[2:02:30] answers I'm afraid I'm afraid friends to
[2:02:34] tell you that uh we're helpless against
[2:02:36] this enemy our army doesn't stand a
[2:02:39] chance we're going to get wiped out we
[2:02:42] don't have a prayer there's not even a
[2:02:43] chance not even a remote chance that
[2:02:45] we're going to
[2:02:48] survive what is it Jehosaphat get get up
[2:02:52] and he admits to the whole church of his
[2:02:55] fear and he calls a National Prayer
[2:02:58] meeting are you with me here tonight in
[2:03:01] front of everyone look at verse 12 I
[2:03:03] want you to notice this because it's so
[2:03:05] important uh he he begins to say this
[2:03:07] brother Jeremy in verse 12 he says Oh
[2:03:10] Our God this is his prayer in front of
[2:03:12] the whole church he says will thou not
[2:03:15] judge them for we have no might against
[2:03:18] this great company that cometh against
[2:03:20] us neither let me go further than no
[2:03:22] might neither know we what to
[2:03:26] do but our eyes are upon
[2:03:32] thee he says that we don't know what to
[2:03:34] do it's a public admission to say oh you
[2:03:38] you know it could have been easy for him
[2:03:39] to go in the back room and to pray this
[2:03:41] you know privately and to say this to
[2:03:43] the Lord Lord I really I can't tell that
[2:03:45] to the people but honestly Lord I don't
[2:03:47] know what to do but no but he gets up
[2:03:48] before everybody and says Lord we don't
[2:03:50] know what to do in other words apapat
[2:03:52] was put in himself with the rest of
[2:03:54] everybody and says we're all in this
[2:03:59] together and Lord we're in your
[2:04:03] hands we're in your hands Lord the
[2:04:06] problem is in your hands Lord he wasn't
[2:04:11] he wasn't concerned about politics he
[2:04:13] wasn't concerned about Public Image he
[2:04:15] wasn't concerned about what people would
[2:04:17] think he wasn't concerned about what
[2:04:20] what people would say here's what he
[2:04:22] knew we're in deep trouble and if God
[2:04:24] doesn't answer we'll be wiped out so
[2:04:26] what does he do he openly admits his
[2:04:29] weakness and begins to call upon the
[2:04:31] Lord notice what it says here back up if
[2:04:34] you could to verse three I want you to
[2:04:36] notice this just as we close here and
[2:04:38] Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to
[2:04:40] seek the Lord and proclaimed to fast
[2:04:42] throughout all of Judah verse four uh
[2:04:45] keep going there and Judah gathered
[2:04:47] themselves together to ask help of the
[2:04:48] Lord even out of all the cities of Judah
[2:04:51] they came to seek the Lord notice he
[2:04:54] says it says he set his face you ever
[2:04:58] read that you read that about Daniel and
[2:05:00] it says he set his face you read that I
[2:05:02] think it's about uh Isaiah or Jeremiah
[2:05:04] he set his
[2:05:06] heart what does that mean when it says
[2:05:09] they they begin to seek their heart it
[2:05:12] says they seek help from the Lord he
[2:05:14] sought the god of his father he's
[2:05:18] seeking the Lord I clicked on that word
[2:05:20] seek it's amazing it means here when it
[2:05:22] says it seek when it says seek not just
[2:05:24] to pray but I'm going to read it to you
[2:05:27] it literally means when it says he said
[2:05:29] his heart to seek the Lord it literally
[2:05:32] means to trample
[2:05:36] underfoot to beat with your feet to beat
[2:05:40] a path to God because you frequent that
[2:05:44] way so
[2:05:47] often you ever seen a beaten path a path
[2:05:50] that you can identify because it's
[2:05:52] traveled a lot this is what it meant he
[2:05:55] had sought he had set his face this was
[2:05:58] a way josaphat knew really
[2:06:01] well he had a beaten Worn Path of all
[2:06:05] the times in the past he had went to God
[2:06:07] for problems and for needs and for
[2:06:09] issues my brother my sister in crisis
[2:06:12] should not be the first time you speak
[2:06:13] to the Lord Jesus but you ought to have
[2:06:16] a beaten path one that's welln to where
[2:06:20] when you begin to pray and say father
[2:06:22] it's a words you've spoken many times
[2:06:24] before to the Lord Jesus oh God help us
[2:06:27] to to be people who only cry out to God
[2:06:30] and and begin to speak to the Lord and
[2:06:32] begin to get in touch with God when we
[2:06:34] have Calamity and crisis but say Lord
[2:06:37] let it be a beaten path that I've
[2:06:41] worn because I
[2:06:43] frequent that way so
[2:06:49] often verse five
[2:06:52] musicians could you come we're going to
[2:06:53] have to close out of time je Jehoshaphat
[2:06:56] stood in the congregation of Judah and
[2:06:59] Jerusalem in the house of the Lord
[2:07:01] before the new court verse 6 and said oh
