you I um brother l or brother Lyall is going to be speaking and teaching on Book of Exodus tonight and it's my plan I want this church I want us to know this book backwards and forwards we're starting we started in the Book of Genesis now we're moving on to Exodus we're going to if the Lord's willing we're going to go through every single book of the Old Testament and we're going to learn something everybody's going to know this book by the time we're finished if the Lord carries that long so I'm excited about that excited also about um I think um we announced that we're going to have our elections I think it was the second week of January um I'm going to take at least one service in December and I'm going to minister on the different offices of the church and so we can as we're all so we can all move together in all in all of this we have let's all stand if we could have some prayer requests I take out these glasses I'm on the wrong side of 50 years old now it's it's sad brother brandom one time he was he was sitting with my family my dad's family around the table brother brandom was going to read the Bible he opened his Bible and Brother David he put on his glasses and he he looked down and he caught my dad's look my dad looked at him like why would he need glasses brother brandom looked right over at my dad and he he holds his glasses up and he said son you just wait till you turn 40 my dad on his 40th birthday he was reading the newspaper and he looked at it and he said I had to move it away a little bit to focus at it and he said from that point on he had to start wearing glasses so that was one of those I don't know if it was necessarily prophecy but it sure happened almost to the day I have a couple prayer requests [Music] here from Sister Amelia she says prayers for my daughter Ava for housing and healing for her and healing for her her legs continue to swell and she has a hard time walking I pray that God will provide a place for her to live bless your sister praying for you I believe that if we bring this request these two requests before the Lord I believe he'll answer sister Gracie I have a thanks I have a Thanksgiving to my Lord Jesus Christ for my daughter Gracie is coming next week from California and she needs prayers for all for all of her tests from college she is going to be a high school teacher thank you sister Gracie let's bow our heads our heads bowed if you would have a request upon your heart the same Jehovah God that our brother Lio is going to be preaching about tonight the same Jehovah God that gave mosus the inspiration to write Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy is the same God that's here here tonight even with all our small crowd he knows if you have a request upon your heart let's just raise our hand Heavenly Father Lord you are the great Jehovah God and Lord when you came here to this earth in the form of a young man named Jesus of Nazareth Lord you instructed us to ask anything in your name and that you would do it so Lord we bring these requests before you for our sister Eva and for sister Gracie's daughter Lord that you would meet those needs and then father every hand that was raised you saw it raised and father we bring these requests before you in the name that is said in St John chapter 14 in the name of Jesus Christ and we claim them we love you Lord we thank you for your many blessings to us and father we ask ask also that you would join us in service tonight as we have this bible study on this great Book of Exodus and father how it goes from a young child that's put in the Nile River in a little basket and how that child's grow that child grows in all the wisdom and then Lord you use him to take your children out of slavery with a mighty hand father we pray that your anointing would be upon brother ly and that you'd anoint our ears to hear and that you would teach us father what you would have for us tonight and that our the anointing would also be on our ears to hear we love you father in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you brother Daniel left the uh the message there this morning and talked about brother Lyall and began to go over Exodus I said I know a song that the very first verse talks about them from there's going to be a meeting in there you've heard the story of Moses so let's sing that first verse and the chorus you have heard this let's start that over you have heard of little Moses in the B you have heard of fearless David and his sling you have heard the story told of dreaming Joseph and of Jonah and the whale you often sing there are many many others through the par I would like to meet them all I do declare by and by the Lord would surely let us meet them in that meeting in the air oh there is going to be a meeting in the my and M I am going to meet you greet you over there in that home beyond the sky oh such singing you will hear never heard by more to here Glory yes I will be the leading one that meeting in the [Music] air excuse me thank you so much and good evening this evening we'll take a look an overview of the book of Exodus in Hebrew it's known as sepher shemot book of names based on the opening verse of Exodus 1 now these are the names of the children of Israel which came out of Egypt but before we open our Bibles let's pray together once more to the author Lord Jesus this is such an immense thing to take on the book of Exodus Lord and to open its pages that you should speak to our hearts through it Lord Lord I just feel so utterly inadequate but Lord it doesn't depend on me we all depend on you the Lord Jesus Christ the one who wrote it Lord so we pray that you would again Lord we ask that you be present tonight that you speak things that would help your people that the people that are gathered here Lord you died for each one you shed your blood on Calvary for each of us Lord honor us with your presence speak to our hearts draw us closer to yourself help us to please you more and more each day that you give us we'll thank you in Jesus precious name amen you may be surprised to know that Exodus is one of the most controversial books in the entire Bible but you won't be surprised that the oming verses will read together are not found in Exodus instead of Mount Si we'll go to a hill on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee where Jesus is concluding The Sermon on the Mount chap Matthew 7 he says therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a a wise man who who built his house upon a rock the rain descended the floods came the winds blew it beat upon that house it fell not for it was found on a rock everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his his house upon the sand the rain descended the floods came the winds blew beat upon that house and it fell great was the fall of it here here Jesus is talking about foundations both houses were probably well constructed one had a foundation anchored to the Rock the other forgot the foundation Exodus is a part of the foundation of the entire Bible as a result it's controversial and always under attack but it's anchored to The Rock in fact it's part of that rock one of the cornerstones as a result it will withstand those storms of controversy and rejection like these two men building a house our faith must have a solid foundation it must be built on Rock are are these stories in the opening books of the Bible are they truth are they rock or are they myths are they false are they sand as is Exodus history or is it myth please be seated I'm sure most of you are aware that Exodus tells the story of the oppression of Israel in Egypt the arrival of a deliverer a miraculous escape from bondage judgment on Egypt and the receiving of the law there are of course many other things that happen in this amazing book but before Israel can leave Egyptian bondage they have to get there and be enslaved so let's quickly review from Genesis telling how they got to Egypt in the first place and at least part of the reason why God sent them there around 291 BC Abram leaves haran and comes to sheim the Lord appears to Abram and the Lord said to AB AB know of assurity that thy seed thy descendants shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance so Abram's descendants will be oppressed four centuries how long were they to be oppressed 400 years the nation that oppresses them will be judged after that judgment The Descendants will leave with significant wealth this is a prophecy the word of the Lord directly to Abram an order or sequence of events over a definite specified time frame 400 years well let's fast forward 215 years to 1876 BC Joseph is sent for his father's Clan to come to Egypt due to a Great Famine Genesis 46 and Israel also called Jacob took his journey with all that he had not just his stuff but his children their spouses his grandchildren all their descendants and came to berseba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father Isaac and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said Jacob Jacob and he said here am I and he said I am God L the god Elohim of thy father fear not to go down to Egypt it's okay to leave this land that I promis would be your inheritance here's why you should go for I will there in Egypt not in Canaan make of thee a a great nation in Egypt your descendants will be forged into a nation I will go down with thee into Egypt I will also surely bring thee up again and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes that's a very personal promise that he's making stepping up to 1446 BC 430 years after Jacob arrived in Egypt read in Exodus 12:40 now the sojourning of the children the descendants of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was 430 years wasn't it supposed to be 400 oops and it came to pass at the end of 430 years it's emphasized even the self-same day it came to pass that all the hosts the people of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt when you read Exodus or perhaps you read it before you came to service these are not just descendants of Israel we're told a couple of verses early in verse 38 that a mixed multitude went out with them well let's address this 400 versus 430 years of apparent discrepancy I I drew a picture Heather says that she relates to pictures I tend to relate to words and Abstract weird weird kind of stuff I'm kind of weird but anyway in 1859 BC 17 years after he arrived Jacob dies Pharaoh you recall allows Joseph and the clan to bury Jacob in Canaan and and then return but 13 years later about 1846 BC there's a change in the regime another Pharaoh arises the Israelites are no longer free to travel out of Egypt Egypt the beginning of the oppression this loss of Freedom so 430 total years in Egypt the first 30 under comparative freedom and prosperity under Joseph and then the oppression begins it could be that Joseph is replaced with an Egyptian visier rather than have a Hebrew wielding such power and influence remember when he revealed himself to his Brethren that even though he was the number two guy in Egypt the Egyptians wouldn't even eat with him said it's an mination to the Egyptians to even eat with a Hebrew about 1806 BC Joseph dies requests that his remains be transported back to Canaan when the descendants of Israel will leave some 360 years later the Hebrews are not free to bury him in Canaan as they were when Jacob died just 53 years earlier so during this period is when the oppression began so there is no contradiction they were oppressed for 400 years they were there for for 430 Exodus opens towards the end of this 430 so year sojourn well like our overview of Genesis this look into Exodus will be very abstract touching on major events or themes in the book but rather than a quick summary of each chapter there's 40 chapters let's look at Exodus in an even more General overview then zero went on some of the events and foundational scripture for Jewish faith and consequently our faith belief and Christianity so fasten your seat belts we're going to go a little quick here Exodus 1-4 tells of the buildup of Oppression the birth and miraculous preservation of Moses his fleeing for his life to Midian where he remains for 40 years God then attracts Moses by a burning bush and commissions him to deliver Israel from Egypt Moses returns to Egypt chapters 5-10 describe the signs he has given the contempt of pharaoh for Moses and the Hebrews and the contest between Moses and Pharaoh in the form of nine devastating plagues a genealogy of Moses is also presented chapters 11 through 13 tell of the 10th and final plague the death of the firstborn in Egypt God's protection via the Passover The Exodus with great wealth the institution of the Passover remembrance and God leading by a pillar of cloud and fire chapter 14 tells of the crossing of the Red Sea and the destruction of Pharaoh's Army that was pursuing them chapter 15 is a song of Moses of Celebration a test through bitter water follows that chapters 16- 18 tell of bread from Heaven called Mana Domino's wasn't the first to deliver food to your house they travel to a dry place and God provides water from a rock they are attacked by and they defeat the people of amalec Moses father-in-law tells him he's too busy with minutia and should assign trusted people to judge small matters and leave the big stuff to to Moses a bit like the deacons of Acts taking some of the load off of the Apostles chapters 19 through 31 include the arrival at Mount Si 45 to 60 days after setting out from Egypt the tablets of the Ten Commandments god- giving Moses a lot of detailed instructions about the Tabernacle and its Associated ritual items altars lamps the ark tables divisions of the space curtain and so forth details of the priest's garments consecration of the priests when he comes down from the mountain chapters 32 and 33 are the worship of the golden calf and the aftermath the command to leave SI the tent of meeting and Moses intercession for the people chapters 34-39 include Moses making new tablets of stone that were renewal of the Covenant Moses shining face reminds you a bit of the mount Transfiguration he comes down from this mountain with a shining face Sabbath regulations contributions for the Tabernacle H and the manufacturer of the various pieces of the Tabernacle the ark the table the lampstand the altars the bronze Basin the court the Priestly garments you might ask yourself a question question here they're taking up this this collection for the Tabernacle but why did they need to do that they're in Midian at the edge of Midian they didn't haul big long poles they didn't haul bolts of linen and all that stuff they needed to make all this stuff from Egypt they had to go to the equivalent of the Home Depot buy that stuff but they had the wealth through that collection that they made so they could get those materials in Midian to do that construction it's it's all it's all very practical chapter 40 concludes Exodus with the assembling of the Tabernacle 11 and a half months after arriving at Mount Si from Egypt and the glory of the Lord filling it when the cloud and fire of the Lord lifted they journeyed when it abided they remained encamped well you can't go home just yet but there's your overview we're going to dig down a bit now Exodus is a second book of the pentat or or the TOA it's known as the TOA in in Hebrew and we thinking that it means law but to actually means teaching God told Moses teach the people these things so the first five books were told they were written by Moses now once in Exodus 17 twice in Exodus 34 we read the Lord commanded Moses to write not to recite to be written some generations later Moses was specifically told to write there's controversy about this of course Moses was raised and educated in Egypt the writing of that language used hieroglyphs there was no alphabet used in Egypt as we think of an alphabet Hebrew the language of most of the Old Testament is not Egyptian and it's written with an alphabet of 22 two characters based on consonants most Scholars most people that look at this will say well the earliest Hebrew writing is about 1,000 BC around the time of of David and Solomon and and Saul some 450 years after the Exodus thus it was impossible for Moses to write the Books ascribed to him instead it was later scribes who wrote from an oral tradition he spoke well which is it in John's gospel John 5:46 Jesus says or if he believed Moses you would have believed me for he spoke no he wrote Of Me amen he wrote well a fellow named Douglas petrovich 2016 published this work and I believe that he was the first person to demonstrate that the uh the Proto consonantal script found in the sin that dates back to this period And even slightly before was actually Hebrew that that prototype alphabet was not Phoenician and Hebrew derived from the Phoenicians it was Hebrew and Phoenician was derived from it and he translates those Works those those uh things that are supposedly Phoenician so he demonstrated that the protoe alphabet was likely begun or developed in the time of Joseph in fact in this book he presents evidence that Joseph's son Manasseh played a role in developing the world's first alphabet which was a Hebrew alphabet therefore Moses wrote it now in Deuteronomy I mean in Exodus excuse me I I'm old it's okay there are no direct prophecies in Exodus of a coming Messiah as there is in Deuteronomy but Moses is a model or sometimes we use the word type of Christ and that speaks volumes the Journey of the nation of Israel from bondage through the waters of the Red Sea to Mount Si ultimately to the land of promise is also a poignant parallel of our Christian Life walk from Egypt from a life of sin through baptism through the Red Sea then a character building Journey for as long as our life lasts and at the end entry to Heaven itself the promised land we often look for types of Christ in Old Testament individuals and by type we mean an analogy ology a similarity a model a simile a metaphor an allegory the the the dictionary definition or at least one of the dictionaries says that a specific definition of type as a noun is quote a person or thing as in the Old Testament believe to foreshadow another as in the New Testament type as a verb can mean to represent in terms of typical characteristics or typify or to represent beforehand as a type A A prefigure Exodus is full of things that are considered types the number and kinds of thread in the Priestly garments the construction of the Tabernacle its fixtures what they represent but as important as these are their inanimate objects tonight I want to focus on lives and interactions with the Lord God again Exodus has no specific prophecy of a messiah but Moses definitely types or prefigures Christ let's look at some of those ways as we Sprint through Exodus there are many more than the ones we'll share tonight but I want to wet your appetite so you'll go home you'll read Exodus you'll look for these things you'll be thinking of the gospels as you read Exodus at moses' Birth Pharaoh tried to kill kill him shortly after Jesus birth Herod tried to kill him e Exodus 1 and he Pharaoh said when you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then you shall kill him but if it be your daughter then she shall live this is a carving in a temple in Egypt of of of a birthing stool but the midwives feared God God and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive skipping to verse 22 Pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born he shall cast into the river every daughter he shall save a life in Matthew 2 we read then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the the children that were in Bethlehem and and and that word actually has a male connotation to it so he killed the the male children and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men both Moses and Jesus were hidden from Death as babies in Exodus 2 there went a man amram of the house of Levi and took to wife a daughter of Levi and the woman joed conceived and bear a son Moses and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months Matthew 2 13 and when they the Magi bearing gifts for the young child Jesus were departed behold the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying arise take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt be thou there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him parallel accounts but let's get back to Moses for just a moment he was a descendant of Levi but Jacob despised Levi on his deathbed Jacob cursed him Genesis 49 Simeon and Levi are brethren instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations oh my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou United for in their anger they slew a man and in their self will they dig down a wall that's referring to the slaughter in sheim and revenge for Dina dig down a wall is a strange expression but if you look it up and research what it's talking about it means they hamstrung the cattle they were just cruel brutal vicious cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel is there a parallel with Jesus we read in John chapter one now Philip with of BEDA the city of Andrew and Peter Philip finded Nathaniel and said unto him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and Nathaniel said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip said unto him come and see can anything good come out of Nazareth can anything good come out of Levi when each was saved from the King's death decree he was watched over by a young woman named Miriam Exodus 2 when she jocked moses' mother could no longer hide him could hide Moses she took for him an ark of bull rushes and dobbed it with slime and with pitch put the child therein and laid it in the flags by the river's Brink and and his sister Miriam stood AAR off to wit what would be done to him and she arranges for her mother to nurse Moses for Pharaoh's daughter and Matthew 2 after getting this warning in a dream when he Joseph arose he took the young child Jesus and his mother it says Mary the Hebrew version of that is Miriam same name by night and departed un Egypt and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my son both were adopted as babies Exodus 2 the child Moses grew and jocked brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter which I believe is a very famous person in Egypt known as hat shepit and he Moses became her son and she called his name Moses and she said because I drew him out of the water she adopted him Matthew 1 then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bid him and took unto him his wife Mary and knew were not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and Joseph called his name Jesus adopted both growing up had a secret identity Moses as a Hebrew Jesus as the Son of God Exodus 2 it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out unto his Brethren and looked on their bird they thought he was an Egyptian high ranking guy he was you know a prince in Egypt he looked upon their burdens and spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his Brethren and Moses looked this way and that way and when he didn't see anyone he killed he slew the Egyptian and hit him in the sand Mark 6 people are saying to one another is not this the carpenter the son of Mary the brother of James and Joseph and Judah and Simon are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him because they didn't know who he really was both sat on Wells and saved a woman in a foreign land Exodus 2 now when Pharaoh heard this thing about Moses killing an Egyptian he sought to slay Moses but Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian huh interesting place and he sat down by a well now the priest of Midian had seven daughters and they came and Drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock and the Shepherds came and drove them away but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock and when they came to R Ru their father he said how is it that you're come so soon today and they said an Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the Shepherds and also Drew water enough for us and watered the flock in John 4 Jesus is in Samaria Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well it was about the sixth hour it was noon there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink parallels Moses married a gentile bride Exodus to Moses was content to dwell with the man of Midian Jethro and he gave Moses Zapora his daughter he married a midianite are there any Gentiles in here here who believe that you're part of the bride of Christ oh we have another parallel memory jog we talked about Genesis recently who was Joseph sold to to take him into slavery in Egypt correct midianite Israelites Genesis 37:28 now Moses is marrying a woman from Midian remember the theme of Genesis Grace both returned to the land from whence they had fled after the death of the king who tried to kill them Exodus 4 the Lord said unto Moses in Midian go return into Egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life Matthew 2 but when Herod was dead behold an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt saying arise and take the Young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel for they are dead which sought the young child's life parallels types both Moses and Jesus were shepherds Exodus 3 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian John 10 Jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep all that ever came before me are thieves robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture thief cometh not but for to steal to kill to destroy I am come that they might have life that they might have it more abundantly I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd gives his life for the Sheep each began his ministry in the wilderness let's start with Jesus's time it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized of John in Jordan and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and his Spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from Heaven saying Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness and after 40 days we read in this time Luke Jesus returned in the power of the spirit Power Miracles into Galilee and there went out a Fame of him throughout all the region roundabout Exodus now Moses kept the flock of jeffro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert in other words the wilderness and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses he knows our name he knows your name he knows my name when he spoke to Jacob he said Jacob Jacob here am I Moses Moses god knew his name and called him by it and Moses said here am I skipping down to verse n now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt a couple of verses later I just will tell you about it Moses we know he was raised in Pharaoh's house he he understood diplomacy he understood respect so he's being spoken to by this voice out of this bush and God says go on down to Egypt and he says well yeah he says well when I get there they're going to ask what's the name of the god that sent you what should I say think of the context they've been in Egypt for 400 years 430 they don't have an established religion they don't have any established worship they none of this all they have is is this story that that God El Elohim uh appeared to Abraham and made a promise and and and and told him to go down to Egypt and they turned us into slaves down here this wasn't such a wonderful thing and so what are they doing there they are involved in Egyptian culture Moses is raised in Pharaoh's house he's involved in Egyptian culture so what Moses is really saying is what what's your name which God are you how do I identify you are you Aman are you Osiris are you Horus are you P are you anabas Toth Reay which name because if I know the name then I know and and they'll know who you are and God says I am that I am no I'm not one of those guys you're a little confused uh a little a little bonus question since we're at the burning bush right now and God's talking to Moses we don't have any record of God speaking to anybody after he spoke to Jacob at uh at Beva that I'm aware of until we get to the burning bush there's no other accounts in Exodus or in Genesis or in this point Exodus so who did God speak to first in the book of Exodus I'm not getting a lot of response Aaron you say wait what are you talking about this is chapter three and and God doesn't tell Aaron to go there until like chapter five Moses is complaining and he says God I I can't talk very well and says the Lord got angry with him and said well I created your mouth I create and Moses still says oh no no no no no so okay well how about Aaron how about your brother Aaron he he can speak pretty good Moses says yeah yeah yeah Aaron and what does God say he's already on his way he's going to meet you here at this mountain wow and now that other chapter where God appeared to Aaron and said go to your brother Moses and Aaron goes into the Wilderness it's not sequential with chapter 3 that actually happened ahead of time because Aaron's already on his way so God already spoke to Aaron before he revealed himself to Moses I'm sure you already knew that but I was excited about that because because I was talking to Heather day and saying you know it seems like there's a contradiction here about about how could what what's going but then yeah Lyall go back read oh yeah okay simple okay moving on both commanded the Wind and Sea which obeyed in Exodus 14 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong East Wind all that night and made the sea dried land and the waters were divided invited H Matthew 8 when Jesus was entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there Rose a great Tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep he must have been really tired and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying Lord save us we perish a bit like the Israelites asking Moses why did you bring us here to die and Jesus said to them why are ye fearful oh ye of little faith then he arose rebuked the winds in the seas and there was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the Sea obey him what manner of man is Moses that even the winds in the sea what manner of man will Joshua be when even the river obeys him both were almost Stoned by those that they were sent to save Exodus 17 we read Moses Cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto this people they be almost ready to Stone me John chapter 8 Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you before Abraham was I am then took they up stones to cast at him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by you'll notice I skipped the Passover communion the Miracles that happened in Egypt were constrained by time please please read Exodus see what other types and parallels you find if if you find it a little awkward to understand some of the wording so read a modern translation we're not digging for Doctrine we're looking for parallels we're looking for types we're looking for Jesus Christ in the book of Exodus one of the big controversies in Exodus has to do with the Exodus itself specifically what route did Moses take them where Mount Si where did they cross the Red Sea and so forth since it was a Wandering nomadic group there are no archaeological artifacts to dig up they didn't build any walled cities there no Wells that are identified that they dug no settlements they got watera from Iraq they didn't need Wells no records from the period of The Exodus and the history of Egypt or the conquered Canaanites although there are definite hints and the the surviving Egyptian records along the line of pauses and military activity at just the right time the map we have here you in the back have to trust me there's a map up here I want to show you a map of the last portion of the Journey of Abram from Mesopotamia to Canaan the important thing to notice on this map is the territory of Egypt it's in lavender you'll notice that the Sinai Peninsula was controlled by or part of Egypt there wasn't much population there but Egypt ran the place I've added three red arrows that roughly correspond to the suggested routes Moses took at the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea the top one is in a marshy area sometimes thought of as a sea of reeds the middle one is near a set of lakes also bit marshy the lowest one is at the Red Sea the section We Now call call the Gulf of Suez the problem with all of these is after they crossed the Red Sea they'd still be in Egypt the portion of the Egyptian Army that didn't pursue them would be waiting the Egyptian Army knowing the area why would they risk themselves going through the marsh they go around to the other side and wait for him to come out Moses glad you split the sea but guess what we got you now they wouldn't have time to sing and dance and rejoice and be happy they'd be running for their lives so another thing that I added uh I didn't mark it here so much but in the by that lowest Arrow a bit further down actually there's a mine a turquoise and copper mine that the Egyptians ran and Hebrew slaves were in there um we'll we'll get to that in just a moment because we we find out now that after they crossed the Red Sea what happened Exodus 15 then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and song he has become my salvation he is my God I will prepare him at habit my father's God I will exalt him well this is prophetic as well in a foundational key of Exodus which will cover at the end of tonight's lesson Miriam and the women took timberl and danced verse 20 Miriam the propheus the sister of Aaron and and of Moses took a timberl in her hand and all the women went out after her with timberl and with dances and Miriam answered them sing ye to the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the the horse in his rer hath he thrown into the sea if they' crossed and walked into the rest of the army they would have been running for their lives not singing and dancing after all they still would have been in Egypt or Egyptian territory but they had such a miraculous and complete deliverance that the song Moses sang that we just saw a tiny portion of it's yet another parallel with Jesus and the redeemed he rescued those go from Exodus 15 to Revelation 15 and I John saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast and over his image and over his Mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God bit like Miriam's timberl and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God the same song is sung as well as the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints I'm going to show you another map this is a possible Exodus route I suspect it's a bit different than most that you may have seen it shows the Red Sea Crossing not near Goan it doesn't show Mount Si in the traditional location or or in the carum location near be cheva carcum is in the territory of Israel today and in the promised land borders as well Moses never entered into the promised land he was forbidden to go there so that can't be the right spot well I think it's this is very likely close to the the actual route the important points cuz we can't prove what the route was is that one there was an exodus there was a red SE Crossing that was miraculous the Israelite nation was beyond the reach of the angry humiliated Egyptians and there is a Mount Si where Moses received the Ten Commandments and the law you may be surprised to see Mount siai and Arabia modern day Saudi Arabia the Sinai was essentially under Egypt in Moses day in the Egyptian Army again they knew the way around it Paul wrote in Galatians 4 that Mount Si is in Arabia Arabia in the time of Paul was not in the siai it was in Arabia I've shown copper colored encirclements at sucot and timna these are near important copper and turquoise mines operated by the Egyptians during the 18th Dynasty again showing that in moses' time Egypt was the political entity that ruled SI and the mines near what is being shown as suod and nobody knows if that's really where suod is that's it's based on certain speculations I suppose but there are graffiti in those mines attesting to Hebrew slave miners it makes sense the Israelites would have come by there to fetch the miners Maybe maybe that's where Aaron was when he escaped went through the Wilderness to meet Moses at Mount Si the burning bush at the traditional locations of the crossing of the Red Sea the Israelite Nation would not have been trapped and unable to move here they've come down this broad broad path all the way around here and boom they can't go any further they're up against it they can't penetrate through those mountains God tells them turn back and Camp by the sea so they turn back and Camp by the Sea gives Pharaoh time to send his army down there and now Pharaoh says gotcha okay um I don't want to get into too much detail here uh let's read the account of the crossing of the sea in Exodus 14 and by the way virtually everyone agrees that Midian was here uh just to keep it interesting we hope okay Exodus 14 the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they turn turn back Retreat it's just like the same word as repent and encamp before philar between migdall and migdall is not a location it just means a tower a fort a an observation post between migdall and the Sea over against bapon before it you shall encamp by by the Sea for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel they're entangled in the land the Wilderness has shut them in so they're stopped by geography virtually impossible mountains they have to turn back and the word from migdall reaches pharaoh and I will harden Pharaoh's heart and he shall follow after them and I will be honored upon Pharaoh upon all his host that the Egyptians May know that I am the Lord and they did so the Egyptian religion declared that Pharaoh was a God if you study Egyptian history you'll recognize that not long after the events of Exodus a fellow named Annan became the Pharaoh declared there was only one God the son Moses didn't get the concept of monotheism from the Egyptians they got it from The Exodus skipping to verse 15 the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift thou up thy stick stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea so what cause the waters to be divided The Obedience of the Prophet holding a stick stretching out his hand and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back or or by or before a strong East Wind all that night made the sea dry land the waters were divided the East Wind when Heather lived in Israel an East Wind would come it was called hamim it's a hot dry wind how did they go over dry ground the waters parted it's pretty soggy you got this hot hot dry East Wind somebody turned on the big hair dryer dried out that ocean floor they can go across they had to turn off that big hair dryer before they went across right if it was pushed back by the wind it would have been past a category five so anyway you can just Ponder on that a little bit if you want the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all Pharaoh's horses his chariots his Horsemen came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked under the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians he made their chariot wheels fall off a little tough to drive your chariot when the wheels fell off that they drave them heavily so that the Egyptian Ian said let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters May Come Again upon the Egyptians upon their chariots and upon their Horsemen again a supernatural act to The Obedience of the Prophet Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the Sea returned to to his strength when the morning appeared the Egyptians fled again against it the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the Sea The Waters returned and covered the Chariots and the horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them now they were safe from the Egyptians and in the region of Midian where Moses had spent 40 years still they didn't depend on moses' knowledge of the geography of Midian for him to return to Mount Si I in the sight of the burning bush that had sent him to Egypt instead they followed the cloud and fire of the Lord to lead them let's skip ahead to being at Mount Si in Exodus 19 and 20 we read of the Lord descending on the mountain and Moses declaring to the people The Ten Commandments and a number of other laws and regulations Jewish tradition says that Moses delivered this to the children of Israel on the day of Pentecost shot another parallel comes down from a Mountain of Fire an acts we read about tongues of fire the law the law of Christ filling of the holy spirit all these parallels Exodus 2412 the Lord said unto Moses come up to me into the mount and be there and I will give thee tables of stone and a law and Commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them Moses rose up and his Minister Joshua Moses went up into the Mount of God and he said to the elders Terry ye here for us until we come again unto you behold Aaron and her are with you if any man have any matters to do let him come to them Moses went up into the mount and a cloud covered the mount and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him up into the mount and Moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights like Jesus was absent from the people for 40 days after his baptism Moses went up to the mountain was gone for 40 days when he came down he had the stone tablets upon which God had written the Ten Commandments but Exodus 32 when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us as for this Moses the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt we what not we don't have a clue what become of him and Aaron who God spoke to who Moses had left in charge in his absence said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the years of your wives your sons your daughters and bring them unto me I I wonder if those earrings required pierced ears that became a symbol of becoming a slave forever of not accepting Freedom anyway it was earrings all the people broke off the Golden Earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron and he received them at their hand and F fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made a molten calf and they said these be thy Gods oh Israel which brought thee out of the land of Egypt Aaron left in charge led the people astray gave into the pressure reminds me of Jesus taking to task the priests of his day because they replaced the Commandments with traditions and these folks are falling back under their old ways the people gave up on Moses returning like many who scoff at the idea of the return of the Lord Jesus so they turned to their wealth and prosperity which they had taken from the Egyptians and worshiped it have you ever asked yourself self why did Aaron make a calf why not a crocodile or a or or a serpent or any number of other things why a calf remember the descendants of Jacob had lived in Egypt for 430 years they had no religious laws no commandment other than circumcision that's recorded and Egyptians not everywhere but it it was it was not uncommon for circumcision to occur amongst the Egyptians as well they were surrounded by the religion of Egypt atheistic Idol based worship they were eventually enslaved with no clear religion only an oral tradition that there was a god of their ancestors that told them to go to Egypt and get enslaved it's only reasonable to assume that they worshiped Egyptian gods perhaps in addition to some sort of worship or acknowledgement of Elohim no wonder the first commandment was you shall have no other gods before me the Miracles Moses wrought in his contest with Pharaoh were known to the Hebrews and served in part to establish God's power and Moses relationship to to the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob as they made their way to Mount Si they constantly complained even after the miracle crossing the Red Sea they were still unconvinced or they would not have asked Aaron to make an idol surely the god that can open the Red Sea bring us through destroy bring us Mana bring us Quail do all this stuff can keep Moses alive up there for 40 days we just have to wait a little while and frankly Aaron probably would have agreed would not have agreed if he didn't Harbor some doubts so why a calf recall the dreams of pharaoh that were interpreted by Joseph were of cattle seven fat ones consumed by seven starving ones it turns out that among the pantheon of Egyptian gods and goddesses there was one called hatur she was an Egyptian goddess which was considered to be the symbolic mother of the Pharaohs she's also the goddess of music dance Joy love sexuality and maternal care she was represented as a cow when Heather and I were in Egypt in 2021 we saw many pillars capped with carvings of a human head with cow ears yet another symbol of hatur when Moses came down from the mountain he was very angry with the people for falling into their old ways smash the stone tablets like Jesus turning over the tables in the temple scolding them for having turned a House of Prayer into a den of Thieves parallels but notice God was about to destroy them and Moses interceded for them before he came down and even after the destruction of the calf Idol Moses was still the deliverer God was still Furious Exodus 32:30 it came to pass on the tomorrow the day after destroying the idol there were 3,000 worshippers at that Idol that were killed that what is 3,000 in one day make you think about the book of Acts on the tomorrow after destroying the idol Moses said unto the people you have sinned a great sin now I will go up unto the Lord per Adventure I can make an atonement for your sin Moses returned unto the Lord Lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou will forgive their sin and if not blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou Hast written in the New Testament what did Jesus do interceded on our behalf gave his life to redeem us brother uh uh Paul Murray in the Sunday school class for the teenagers has written on the board there that U uh he had no sin but ours wow we have no righteousness but his there are so many lessons in this book all I could do is ask the Lord to help me know which to bring out forgive me if if I've overlooked miss something that should have been mentioned this evening I'd like to close with a flashback to the burning bush if the musicians would please come at this time it's foundational to the Book of Exodus and explains why God did all of this as a result it's foundational to the Jewish faith and to our faith which branched out from Judaism so long ago read with me please from Exodus chapter 6 God spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the Lord I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty Elohim but by my name Jehovah Yahweh was I not known even to them I have also established my Covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers I've also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I have remembered my Covenant wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians I will rid you out of their bondage I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with with great judgments he hears our prayers he breaks the shackles of sin and I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a god other translations say I will be your God this isn't you'll have a lot of descendants this is relationship this is adoption ye shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians the weight of sin and its consequences by Grace his provision not our efforts apart from him and I will bring you into the land concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob I will give it to you for heritage I am the Lord and the New Testament parallel we started this evening reading from the First Gospel Matthew we'll end with a reading from the last gospel John John 14 Jesus speaking let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also I I'd like to sing a song and I'd like you that know it to sing it with me and you that don't know it to learn it really fast so you can sing it with me the the tune comes from a song called one more exodus by a group called the rambos back in 1969 but the words this is the same first two verses but the third verse has been replaced with two more verses that were written by uh sister Rebecca Smith when Heather when I was in the Army in in at Fort Campbell the 101st Airborne 49 years ago um and 1974 we went to the meetings in Jeffersonville at brandom Tabernacle it was either the Easter meetings or the or or the uh Labor Day meetings but I'm pretty certain it was the Easter meetings and sister Bea played the song and I wrote the words down because I was impressed with it anyway it's I i' I've entitled it the Third Exodus so please bear with me but please sing with me in the days of Old King Pharaoh God's people were enslaved in bondage to that Wicked King till they laid down in the grave they cried to God in heaven our load is hard to Bear then said Moses thus saith God and showed the Lord's Almighty power pray on a little longer [Music] children work on it won't be long there's one more Exodus coming God's going to lift your heavy low God turned the water into blood BL Darkness filled the land and all the wicked felt the touch of the Lord's Almighty hand all Egypt lost their firstborn death claimed King Pharaoh's son then he let God's people go that was Exodus number one work on there's a crown awaiting press on to Victory there's one more Exodus coming God's going to set his people free by a pillar of fire he led them to the distant promised land their God himself would be made flesh and live amongst them as a man he walked the road to Calvary he rose again that's true then sent to us the holy ghost that was Exodus number two press on a little farther children walk on his face to see there's one more Exodus coming God's going to set his people free come out of her my people was the eagle cry we heard as Elijah to the last Church age turn the hearts back to the word he knew his days were numbered so food for us he stored and warned us to seek perfect love apply the token to your door look up the savior's coming it is a Exodus number three those gone on will soon be with us to begin the jub [Music] [Applause] amen I have a couple things that I want to say about our brother's sermon um but before before I want to read a scripture but before I um people people make mistakes sometimes and I uh if I could just stay between Genesis and Revelation I think I'd do really well but but instead sometimes I st things I was uh before service as I was I was greeting the people I talked about the boys back there those boys have been in church more than I have over the past few weeks but I I had I really enjoyed being around them at camp and um I really I just appreciate apprciate them and um sister Denise I really do appreciate you and appreciate your family and it's good to see they're they're um just dear dear to my heart as all your family is um I want to read a scripture brother Lyall was as he was talking as he was bringing out the parallels between Moses and Jesus and he was placing Jesus here in this Old Testament and I got just so excited we know most of us know the story of Exodus we know Moses and the bull rushes and and Pharaoh's sister taking taking the baby out and we know him growing up and then him going into the Wilderness and and the the um the burning bush sending him back and then and then him coming and getting the people and God bringing 10 plagues upon Egypt and bringing them out and bringing them into the Wilderness those are wonderful stories but I want to I want to place emphasis on what our brother did tonight and I would encourage you to come back and to listen to this sermon tonight I want to read to you something out of the New Testament of Acts the last chapter in the book of Acts this is the Apostle Paul this is the greatest teacher that I think that has ever struck the Earth this Apostle Paul acts chap 28 verse 23 this is when Paul goes back to Rome and he's imprisoned in Rome and watch what the Apostle B Paul does he does the same thing that our brother Lyall did right here listen to this and when they had appointed him a day this is Paul remember he's he's under house arrest there came many to him into his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God persuading them concerning Jesus both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets from Mourning until evening exactly what our brother did we can learn the stories and the stories are encouraging but what brother Lyall did is brother Lyall took Moses the man of God he took Exodus and he said look here is the Old Testament God and here is the New Testament God and they're the same one it is Jesus Christ in the Old Testament and it's Jesus Christ in the New Testament absolutely wonderful beautiful let's all stand God bless you all I feel good brother Aaron do you have a song for us hosana
