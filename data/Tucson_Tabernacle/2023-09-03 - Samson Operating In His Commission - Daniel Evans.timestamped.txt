[31:30] verses 23 to 26.
[31:34] when Martha's talking to the Lord Darren
[31:39] Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall
[31:41] rise again
[31:43] Martha said unto him I know that he
[31:45] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[31:47] the last day
[31:48] and Jesus said unto her I am the
[31:51] resurrection
[31:53] and the life he that believeth in me
[31:56] though he were dead yet shall he live
[31:58] looking at someone that was in the Tomb
[32:02] and though he were dead he shall live
[32:05] and he said whosoever liveth and
[32:07] believeth in me shall never die then he
[32:10] asked believeth thou this
[32:12] and I raised my hand and I said yes Lord
[32:14] I believe
[32:15] amen

[42:57] our lives are set up or our lives are
[43:00] going like the Lord would want us to
[43:03] it's um
[43:04] it's a time of reflection the Bible says
[43:07] let a man examine himself
[43:09] pray that we've done that this week and
[43:11] that uh this eve this this afternoon
[43:14] will be the same this time of of
[43:16] reflection
[43:18] um
[43:19] for plans
[43:21] for next week
[43:24] we are almost finished just this close
[43:29] to the the kids room the new kids room
[43:31] here
[43:32] um and I want to I want to open it up
[43:35] next Sunday after service
[43:38] and I've
[43:40] asked sister Rachel to plan a potluck
[43:43] for after service next Sunday so we can
[43:45] stay and the kids can enjoy themselves
[43:47] in the new room here I think it'll be a
[43:49] real blessing to everyone to the parents
[43:52] to the to the kids we'll have the upper
[43:54] room open and then we also have a
[43:57] musicians practice scheduled also for
[44:00] after Sunday so we'll cancel service
[44:02] next Sunday night
[44:04] and we will have a potluck after service
[44:06] on Sunday morning I'll send out an
[44:09] announcement I'm looking forward to that
[44:10] I think it's going to be a blessing to
[44:12] the to the kids I want them
[44:14] to enjoy coming to church I want them to
[44:17] enjoy the word I want them to enjoy
[44:19] Sunday school I want them to enjoy the
[44:21] worship and I want them to enjoy the
[44:23] fellowship we draw strength from each
[44:25] other and if we can start as as young
[44:28] children developing these friendships
[44:30] and these bonds instead of kids tearing
[44:33] each other down
[44:35] then they can get together and they can
[44:37] build each other up
[44:39] that's my
[44:40] that's my harsh desire
[44:43] for the young people
[44:45] I've been wanting to minister on the
[44:48] Book of Judges
[44:50] it's been on my heart for some time and
[44:53] and over the past week or so I was
[44:55] praying and asking the Lord what he
[44:58] wanted me to preach on on Sunday
[45:01] and my mind just kept going back to this
[45:04] book
[45:05] of judges and the most famous judge
[45:09] that we know of in the Bible is this man
[45:11] named Samson
[45:13] so I want to talk about him this morning
[45:16] and the judges when we talk about Judges
[45:19] we're not talking about a man that sits
[45:21] in a robe and and sits presiding over a
[45:24] courtroom that's not what these judges
[45:27] were these judges were deliverers
[45:30] for Israel they were they were men and
[45:33] in one case a woman that that came and
[45:35] they provided the leadership that the
[45:39] country needed
[45:41] to get out of some very difficult times
[45:43] which I'll talk about here in a moment
[45:45] Moses when they were came to the Jordan
[45:50] River and they were about to go over to
[45:52] the promised land Moses tells the people
[45:54] he says listen he says if you serve God
[45:59] will bless you
[46:01] but if you don't serve God and you fall
[46:04] into sin and you fall into this idolatry
[46:06] then the curses of God will rest upon
[46:10] you
[46:10] and it's the same as as we go through
[46:13] life
[46:15] when we are serving God we're going to
[46:18] be happier no when you give your heart
[46:20] to the Lord you're not going to get a
[46:21] check in the mail for a million dollars
[46:24] it's it's not like that but when you
[46:27] really give your heart to the Lord and
[46:30] you're really serving God there's the
[46:32] happiness that's there and that's the
[46:34] comfort knowing that Jesus Christ is on
[46:36] the throne and he's going to take care
[46:39] of whatever need that we have
[46:42] and when we get away from God as you
[46:45] will see today
[46:47] we see that we may be wanting to have
[46:51] fun we may be wanting to Rebel we may be
[46:54] wanting to sin but those sins are just
[46:58] make our lives more difficult and they
[47:01] cause us to suffer God doesn't want his
[47:03] children to suffer just like I wouldn't
[47:05] want my children to suffer you and want
[47:07] your children to suffer he wants us to
[47:09] prosper he wants us to
[47:11] to be happy and happiness will never be
[47:15] found in sin as you will see from this
[47:19] man Samson's life so Moses tells he
[47:22] warns the people Joshua comes on the
[47:25] scene
[47:26] and and they divide the land they go
[47:29] over Jordan they divide the land
[47:31] and
[47:34] God continues to deliver Israel out of
[47:39] the hands of their enemy
[47:42] and then towards the end of Joshua the
[47:45] Israelites pledge
[47:47] they say that
[47:50] we want to serve God and we will
[47:52] continue to serve God he's done so much
[47:54] for us so we want to continue to serve
[47:58] him well time goes on
[48:01] after that gen and that generation that
[48:04] knew Joshua that saw the Miracles that
[48:06] saw everything that happened under
[48:08] Joshua's Ministry time goes on all of
[48:11] those Warriors died out and then we see
[48:16] sin come in and start to enter this the
[48:20] Israel Israelites through idolatry and
[48:24] through
[48:25] all kinds of bad things
[48:28] and God had his eyes
[48:33] on this country of Israel for a very
[48:36] special reason
[48:38] and I can't think of a more important
[48:40] reason was because eventually he was
[48:43] going to bring Christ
[48:45] through this lineage of Israel and he
[48:48] had to protect that lineage All Through
[48:52] the Ages because he would one day bring
[48:55] the Messiah or the Redeemer through this
[48:59] bunch of people called the Jews the lion
[49:03] of the tribe of Judah shows you how
[49:05] important that Jesus is
[49:08] God protected that line because his son
[49:11] would come through that line and today
[49:14] any Minister any church anything that's
[49:17] worth anything if you promote Jesus
[49:21] Christ and if you introduce people to
[49:23] Christ then you will be doing well
[49:26] but if you're introducing people to a
[49:28] church or to a Doctrine or to themselves
[49:30] that is when it doesn't do any good in
[49:33] fact it just brings harm
[49:35] into into the church
[49:38] so and judges 2 7
[49:42] . again these judges weren't Kings they
[49:44] weren't appointed by men they weren't
[49:46] elected they didn't come through a
[49:48] lineage they didn't move up through the
[49:49] military ranks they were simply chosen
[49:51] by God to lead Israel out of imminent
[49:54] destruction they were gifts that God
[49:56] placed there judges 2 7 says this
[50:00] and the people served the Lord all the
[50:02] days of Joshua and all the days of the
[50:05] elders that outlived Joshua who had seen
[50:07] all the great works of the Lord that he
[50:09] did for Israel
[50:11] as I said
[50:12] they remembered all the great things
[50:16] then in judges 2 18
[50:19] it says this and when the Lord raised
[50:22] them up judges the Lord was with the
[50:25] judge and delivered them out of the hand
[50:27] of their enemies all the days of the
[50:30] judge for it repented the Lord because
[50:33] of their groanings by reasons of them
[50:36] that oppressed them and vexed them
[50:39] then
[50:41] so so they would sin and God would bring
[50:44] a judge to help them out
[50:47] and later on in the Book of Judges
[50:50] it makes this statement a couple times
[50:52] it says that every man did that which
[50:57] was right in his own eyes
[51:00] you think well that's that sounds pretty
[51:02] good that sounds pretty good that that
[51:04] someone would do right in their own eyes
[51:07] they didn't have a prophet then they
[51:09] didn't have a king
[51:10] they didn't have a leader like Samson or
[51:12] Gideon or Barrick or Samuel there was no
[51:16] leadership in Israel so everybody did
[51:20] kind of what they thought was right in
[51:23] their own eyes and almost every time
[51:26] it was for their own benefit
[51:30] and we see that friends we are in that
[51:34] time today
[51:35] we see that people they they don't want
[51:39] to they don't want to Worship the Lord
[51:40] they don't want to a fellowship they
[51:43] don't want to come to church they want
[51:45] to just the church will be there it's
[51:47] good for their own for maybe say Allah
[51:50] I'm a Christian
[51:52] I go to church once a week or I go to
[51:54] church once a month or whatever it is
[51:56] but I don't want it to cramp my style
[52:00] I don't want to put Church any higher I
[52:02] don't want to put God any higher than
[52:05] what I believe than what I do because I
[52:07] am first I want my way
[52:11] and then I want to be able to say I'm a
[52:12] Christian because when I die if there is
[52:14] a God I want to make sure that I go to
[52:16] heaven and I don't go to hell
[52:19] and
[52:21] that's what happens when there is no
[52:24] leadership
[52:26] and this was happening this in the
[52:28] judges where there was no leadership so
[52:30] everybody just kind of did whatever they
[52:32] wanted there was no Unity there were
[52:34] there was no and there's power in unity
[52:37] so when
[52:38] and it set it up to where a kingdom like
[52:41] the Philistines could just come in and
[52:43] take over
[52:44] and just rule
[52:45] because they weren't a united front
[52:49] against them
[52:50] and I think and I see today God sends
[52:54] into the church he sends gifts into the
[52:57] church
[52:58] and those gifts we
[53:01] hear we hear it so often Ephesians 4 he
[53:05] sends Apostles and Prophets and
[53:07] evangelists and pastors and teachers
[53:09] those things are gifts that God places
[53:13] into the church to help the church
[53:18] to be servants to the church to to
[53:21] provide that leadership and that
[53:23] correction to say hey you're you need to
[53:27] be here more often because I can see
[53:29] you're starting to slip away
[53:31] I can see the world start to creep into
[53:34] your lives
[53:36] this church
[53:37] will help
[53:39] come in what better thing do you have to
[53:42] do
[53:44] then go to church think about it
[53:47] what's what's more important in your
[53:49] life
[53:50] than than coming here
[53:52] fellowshipping worshiping and hearing
[53:55] the word of the Lord
[53:57] now there's a lot
[54:00] that abused that
[54:04] and
[54:05] I've seen
[54:07] I've seen people hurt very badly
[54:11] because of church
[54:13] and I've seen a sister I won't I won't
[54:16] say her name
[54:18] but she gave me this book
[54:22] the other day
[54:24] and this book
[54:28] is dedicated
[54:31] using quotes from a man of God named
[54:35] William Branham
[54:36] and bible verses to justify taking
[54:40] someone out from underneath the blood
[54:45] and turning them over to Satan just
[54:47] because they didn't line up with the way
[54:48] that the church teaches
[54:51] there is a place for that First
[54:53] Corinthians chapter 5 Paul there was a
[54:56] there was a man that was sinning greatly
[54:59] he was having an affair with his
[55:01] stepmother
[55:03] it was an awful thing so Paul says I
[55:06] will turn him over to Satan for the
[55:08] destruction of his flesh so that his
[55:10] soul would be saved it was an act of
[55:12] kindness
[55:13] it was an act of love that Paul did to
[55:16] this person and we see them taking that
[55:20] scripture and taking other scriptures
[55:22] and taking other quotes and putting them
[55:23] together and saying that if you don't do
[55:25] the way that we teach you we'll cast you
[55:28] out and you'll be under Satan then it
[55:30] puts a fear into the people
[55:33] and it is a lie let me tell you
[55:36] something that is wrong I it's it's
[55:39] something that I will stand against
[55:42] and it has hurt so many people
[55:46] telling them
[55:48] that if you don't do it the way we say
[55:51] you should do it then you are condemned
[55:53] let me tell you something in the book of
[55:55] First Corinthians Paul does that and you
[55:58] know what happens in second Corinthians
[56:00] that man comes back
[56:03] he comes back he repents of his sins
[56:07] and he comes back and he has entered
[56:09] back into the fellowship so let me tell
[56:11] you Paul was a true Apostle of God if
[56:14] that if you do that
[56:16] and that person is not reconciled and
[56:20] that person does not come back to the
[56:22] Lord then you friends are a false
[56:25] prophet in doing it
[56:27] because you have done it you have spoken
[56:29] presumptuously you have done it out of
[56:31] the will of God
[56:33] and I will I've seen so many people hurt
[56:36] by Churches by by attacking these people
[56:40] and and putting fear into them there
[56:42] should be fear of God and God only
[56:46] not fear of a church not fear of a
[56:49] pastor not fear of a priest but fear of
[56:51] God that you would disappoint him
[56:56] that's the truth
[56:58] and so many people in this church are
[57:01] here they're they've been hurt in the
[57:03] past that is wrong
[57:07] picking and choosing things that men of
[57:10] God have said and putting them together
[57:12] and changing the word of God in hatred
[57:16] and in and attacking God's children
[57:23] I didn't I really want to go into that
[57:25] but
[57:28] this place
[57:30] I stand against that
[57:33] there is a place for correction of
[57:35] course if you're walking out in the
[57:37] world and you're sinning you are walking
[57:38] the line of Heaven and Hell
[57:41] don't get anywhere close to that line
[57:45] but let me tell you just because you may
[57:48] not
[57:49] interpret the word like I do
[57:52] that doesn't that's no reason to cast
[57:54] someone out the reason you cast someone
[57:56] out is number one if they're doing harm
[57:58] to the church if they're a danger to the
[58:00] church
[58:00] then that person is not welcome here or
[58:03] like this brother
[58:05] it's an act of compassion and it's an
[58:07] act of love
[58:09] and then he comes back
[58:12] that's the way you do it but here in the
[58:14] Book of Judges these these people they
[58:16] were doing what was right in their own
[58:18] eyes
[58:20] Proverbs Chapter 12 says this the way of
[58:22] a fool is right in his own eyes
[58:25] but he that hearketh unto counsel is
[58:27] wise
[58:29] so yes we do come into the congregation
[58:31] for correction we do come here to learn
[58:35] more about the Lord and to be corrected
[58:37] to keep us away from hell to keep us
[58:40] away from the enemy and to send us to
[58:42] Christ
[58:45] Proverbs 21 said every way of a man
[58:49] is right in his own eyes
[58:52] so we all think we're right and the way
[58:54] we're doing things but it takes a humble
[58:56] heart
[58:57] to be able to take correction
[59:02] correction is very important a humble
[59:04] heart is very important we should come
[59:06] here and say Lord I want to be better I
[59:09] want to be a better servant of you but
[59:12] Satan the nature of Satan is one that no
[59:16] no no you just do what feels right in
[59:19] your own eyes you just do as you feel to
[59:22] do
[59:24] and then you'll be fine see you have
[59:27] your own relationship with God you have
[59:29] your own understanding that's true you
[59:31] do but that doesn't mean that this word
[59:34] is not our absolute in all things
[59:37] Our Lives must live up to this word
[59:41] Isaiah Chapter 14 verse 12.
[59:45] Prophet is addressing Satan he says how
[59:48] art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer
[59:50] son of the morning
[59:52] how art thou cut down to the ground
[59:53] which did weaken the Nations for thou
[59:56] has said in thine heart I will Ascend
[59:58] into heaven I will exalt my throne above
[1:00:00] the stars of God I will sit also on the
[1:00:02] Mount of the congregation in the sides
[1:00:05] of the north I will Ascend above the
[1:00:07] heights of the clouds I will be like the
[1:00:10] most high
[1:00:12] wow
[1:00:14] how many times have we heard that Spirit
[1:00:16] come from the pulpit
[1:00:18] you're great
[1:00:20] you will Ascend you will be this great
[1:00:24] thing
[1:00:25] that's exactly what Satan said let me
[1:00:29] tell you we are nothing
[1:00:31] Jesus is everything
[1:00:33] and if we can just put our trust in him
[1:00:35] he'll love us he'll take care of us and
[1:00:38] and he will exalt us he will bring us to
[1:00:41] heaven
[1:00:42] but it's not us
[1:00:44] everything
[1:00:46] is about our Lord
[1:00:49] I think that
[1:00:52] you know we think
[1:00:55] there's going to be a lot of
[1:00:56] disappointment
[1:00:57] for message Believers on the day of
[1:00:59] judgment let me tell you that
[1:01:01] just because you think that because you
[1:01:06] have been chosen to hear a great message
[1:01:08] which we have
[1:01:11] it doesn't matter unless we have a
[1:01:15] relationship with Jesus Christ that is
[1:01:18] everything that's what it was for
[1:01:20] as I said about Israel God protected
[1:01:24] Israel because he had a messiah coming
[1:01:26] it was all about Jesus All Through the
[1:01:30] Ages Even Adam and Eve in the Garden of
[1:01:32] Eden and and slaying the the lamb and
[1:01:35] taking the skin and covering up their
[1:01:37] nakedness it was about Jesus
[1:01:39] from the start to the Finish it's about
[1:01:43] one man the man Christ Jesus and
[1:01:45] everything this whole book points to
[1:01:49] that man
[1:01:52] judges
[1:01:54] they have lost their perspective Judges
[1:01:57] chapter 13 verse 1.
[1:02:00] and the children of Israel did evil in
[1:02:02] this again in the sight of the Lord
[1:02:05] and the Lord delivered them into the
[1:02:07] hands of the Philistines 40 years
[1:02:11] and there was a certain man of Zora of
[1:02:13] the family of the danites whose name was
[1:02:16] Manoa and his wife was Barren and bear
[1:02:18] not and the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:02:21] unto the woman and said unto her behold
[1:02:23] now Thou Art Barren and bearth not but
[1:02:26] Thou shalt conceive and bear a son
[1:02:30] now therefore beware
[1:02:32] I pray thee and drink not wine nor
[1:02:35] strong drink and eat not any unclean
[1:02:38] thing
[1:02:39] for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a
[1:02:41] son and no razor shall come on his head
[1:02:45] for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
[1:02:48] God from the womb and he shall begin to
[1:02:51] deliver Israel out of the hands of the
[1:02:54] Philistines now the situation here
[1:02:55] Israel was under the rulership of this
[1:02:59] Philistine Nation they were the
[1:03:01] occupying
[1:03:03] group and as I think about it as I was
[1:03:06] reading that scripture
[1:03:08] he tells
[1:03:10] the angel of the Lord tells this this
[1:03:12] lady he says don't drink wine or strong
[1:03:15] drink or eat anything unclean while this
[1:03:18] baby is in your womb
[1:03:21] so
[1:03:22] it goes to show
[1:03:24] that when we see it everywhere that a
[1:03:27] mother that's
[1:03:28] conceived and has a child
[1:03:32] be careful with smoking and drinking and
[1:03:35] drugs and all of that and all that I
[1:03:38] hear so often well it doesn't affect the
[1:03:39] baby it does
[1:03:41] and in fact science says it does but
[1:03:44] also the Bible says right here be
[1:03:46] careful
[1:03:47] be careful of that unborn child in the
[1:03:49] womb
[1:03:51] this word Nazarite
[1:03:53] that that the angel tells this lady
[1:03:57] it's a a separation this man is a
[1:04:00] Nazarite he separates himself he doesn't
[1:04:02] cut his hair doesn't drink alcohol he
[1:04:04] doesn't touch a dead body
[1:04:06] there's other things that give him an
[1:04:08] outward commitment to holiness
[1:04:11] and Samson is the most famous person
[1:04:14] that I know of in the Bible that had
[1:04:16] that Nazarite Vow where he didn't he
[1:04:19] didn't cut his hair it was an outward
[1:04:20] you could look at him and say okay well
[1:04:21] he's got this vowel but you know there's
[1:04:23] other people you know what another
[1:04:25] famous one was
[1:04:27] Samuel
[1:04:28] the prophet
[1:04:30] he also was under that Nazarite vow even
[1:04:34] Paul we've been going through the book
[1:04:35] of Acts there's times when Paul would go
[1:04:37] a stretch of time and not cut his hair
[1:04:40] because he had a vow then you see in the
[1:04:43] Bible that he will go and cut his hair
[1:04:46] and then it will say that he cut his
[1:04:48] hair because he had that vow and he was
[1:04:52] finished with that Nazarite time
[1:04:56] and it wasn't just her hair they lived a
[1:04:58] strict legalistic life to the Lord while
[1:05:01] they had that vow
[1:05:03] so
[1:05:04] this Angel as I just read comes to this
[1:05:07] lady
[1:05:09] and she goes and tells her husband
[1:05:12] her husband's name Manoa Manoa goes in
[1:05:15] and he said he gets on his knees and he
[1:05:17] prays he says Lord I would really like
[1:05:18] it if this man they didn't know it was
[1:05:19] an angel if this man that came to my
[1:05:22] wife if he would come also and tell me
[1:05:24] these things that he told my wife they
[1:05:26] couldn't have children and this was a
[1:05:28] big deal I want to know all this so he
[1:05:31] prayed
[1:05:33] this man comes back he comes to manoa's
[1:05:36] wife she's like wait a minute
[1:05:38] I gotta introduce my husband so she goes
[1:05:41] introduces this
[1:05:44] man to her husband and he says hey will
[1:05:48] you tell me what you told my wife
[1:05:50] so he tells her most of what he had told
[1:05:53] his wife
[1:05:55] and then Manoa he's just taken by back
[1:05:58] by this man of God he says he says hey
[1:06:00] how about staying for supper
[1:06:03] he says I'm good I'm gonna go get a goat
[1:06:05] and we'll kill it and we'll make some
[1:06:06] food and
[1:06:07] and the guy says the man says no
[1:06:10] I'm not going to do that but if you're
[1:06:12] going to take that goat make a burnt
[1:06:15] offering to the Lord
[1:06:17] with it I'm not going to eat but take
[1:06:19] that goat and let's make a burnt
[1:06:21] offering so Manoa takes the goat takes
[1:06:24] it to the altar he kills it lights the
[1:06:26] fire they put the the offering to the
[1:06:29] Lord on the altar the Flames are coming
[1:06:32] up and as those Flames are coming up
[1:06:36] this man
[1:06:38] goes up into these flames
[1:06:41] and goes up into heaven
[1:06:44] and I was like whoa
[1:06:46] didn't expect that
[1:06:49] he looks up and he says he says honey
[1:06:51] I'm dead we're dead everything's over
[1:06:53] we're gonna die that was God that we
[1:06:56] didn't know it we're everything's and he
[1:06:58] freaks out his wife like honey calm down
[1:07:01] listen
[1:07:03] I don't think that he would want us he
[1:07:06] would come and have told us this that
[1:07:08] this was going to happen and to make an
[1:07:10] offering if God was going to kill us
[1:07:12] don't you love when our wives settle us
[1:07:14] down sometime I don't mind us and I'll
[1:07:17] get all worked up and it's like honey
[1:07:20] and that's what happened here
[1:07:22] so
[1:07:23] what the angel told them came to pass
[1:07:27] they
[1:07:28] they raised the child
[1:07:31] in
[1:07:32] the admonition of the Lord in the in the
[1:07:35] way that this Angel told them and God
[1:07:38] doesn't do things just just to do them
[1:07:42] he wanted to make an impression on these
[1:07:44] parents to tell them to raise this child
[1:07:47] right
[1:07:48] so they did they raised him
[1:07:50] and
[1:07:53] even though he was a man of God
[1:07:58] Samson had a lot of weaknesses
[1:08:01] and the most prevalent of those
[1:08:04] weaknesses was he was attracted to girls
[1:08:09] that he shouldn't have been attracted to
[1:08:12] he liked the the girls that were not the
[1:08:16] kind of girls that you'd want to bring
[1:08:17] home to mom as it as it said as the
[1:08:20] saying goes
[1:08:22] and we see that throughout his life we
[1:08:26] see that as a major weakness he has and
[1:08:29] and he tells his parents so he's out and
[1:08:31] about and he meets this girl that's not
[1:08:34] of his own faith
[1:08:37] she's a girl that we would call today
[1:08:39] she wouldn't be a Christian girl
[1:08:41] she's somebody that didn't have the same
[1:08:43] values that wasn't raised in the same
[1:08:45] way and this man Samson he looks at her
[1:08:48] and he likes her and the Bible says that
[1:08:51] she was pleasing in his eyes he liked
[1:08:52] the way she looked
[1:08:55] so he meets her he's talking he comes
[1:08:57] back home he tells his parents and he's
[1:08:59] like hey Mom and Dad I uh I met this
[1:09:02] girl
[1:09:03] and I think I want to marry her
[1:09:05] and they're like whoa whoa whoa
[1:09:08] and in parents we see our kids
[1:09:12] and the worst thing in my opinion that
[1:09:16] I've seen the biggest problems in the
[1:09:19] lives of people growing up Through the
[1:09:22] Ages and we've all seen it is yoking
[1:09:25] yourself up with the wrong man or the
[1:09:27] wrong woman
[1:09:29] it is just it opens the door for
[1:09:33] problems and for a miserable life
[1:09:36] and his parents see Samson they're
[1:09:38] they're the young man and and they're
[1:09:40] like they're like honey aren't there
[1:09:42] enough girls at church
[1:09:45] aren't there aren't there girls aren't
[1:09:47] there some Christian girls that you
[1:09:48] wanna that you would want to to marry or
[1:09:52] to date but you're dating this girl she
[1:09:54] doesn't have the same value she doesn't
[1:09:55] live right her parents doesn't live
[1:09:56] right they don't live under the same
[1:09:58] values that that we have that she's not
[1:10:01] as we would say she's not even a
[1:10:02] Christian
[1:10:04] but Samson
[1:10:07] there was something going on going on
[1:10:09] behind the scenes
[1:10:12] it worried Samson
[1:10:14] I mean it worried Samson's parents
[1:10:17] and for the young people
[1:10:20] as I said at the beginning God wants you
[1:10:22] to be happy
[1:10:23] he wants you to enjoy your life
[1:10:26] if you marry someone who is not a
[1:10:30] believer
[1:10:31] someone who doesn't respect this book
[1:10:34] someone who doesn't respect the Lord
[1:10:37] Jesus
[1:10:38] it's problems down the road
[1:10:41] you will suffer
[1:10:45] you you won't have the same Foundation
[1:10:49] there's going to be trouble down the
[1:10:51] road
[1:10:53] so if I could give a warning
[1:10:56] to young people today if you don't get
[1:10:57] anything out of this sermon this morning
[1:10:59] other than this be careful
[1:11:03] have patience
[1:11:06] God will send the right one along don't
[1:11:08] settle for someone that is not filled
[1:11:11] with the Holy Spirit and doesn't put God
[1:11:13] first in his or her life
[1:11:16] there'll be trouble down the way not
[1:11:19] just for the Young Folks
[1:11:20] but for all of us when we're choosing
[1:11:22] our friends or if you're later in life
[1:11:24] and and there may be an opportunity to
[1:11:27] to have have a mate
[1:11:30] be careful
[1:11:33] always be careful with that
[1:11:35] but in this case
[1:11:38] there was something going on behind the
[1:11:40] scenes
[1:11:42] with Samson's desire to have this
[1:11:44] Philistine moment Judges chapter 14
[1:11:46] verse 4.
[1:11:49] but his father and his mother knew not
[1:11:52] that it was of the Lord
[1:11:55] that he sought an occasion against the
[1:11:57] Philistines for at that time the
[1:11:58] Philistines had dominion over Israel
[1:12:03] let me say this
[1:12:05] before we get into the testimony of
[1:12:06] Samson even Samson even though he was
[1:12:08] perfectly in God's will in seeking out
[1:12:11] this Philistine girls that scripture
[1:12:12] just said he still suffered horribly
[1:12:16] for marrying a girl that was outside his
[1:12:19] faith
[1:12:20] even though
[1:12:22] it was God's will he still suffered for
[1:12:25] it
[1:12:28] but how good does it feel feel
[1:12:30] when we are in God's will
[1:12:33] how good does it feel when when as as I
[1:12:36] was talking about this
[1:12:40] let me tell you something I can stand
[1:12:42] here and and I can Minister and it's
[1:12:44] like Lord am I trying am I doing right
[1:12:47] and I'm constantly there's there's
[1:12:49] turmoil there but when I stand there and
[1:12:51] say this
[1:12:54] and what that what some of you have been
[1:12:57] told and trying to control you and
[1:12:59] dominate your life I can stand here and
[1:13:01] say bring it on that's false
[1:13:03] that is wrong
[1:13:05] and have that confidence knowing that I
[1:13:07] stand Here In The Name Of The Lord
[1:13:10] doing my best but standing against the
[1:13:13] bullying of the enemy
[1:13:17] you know you're right and you're
[1:13:19] prepared for battle you can pull that
[1:13:21] sword and say Bring It On Satan let me
[1:13:24] let me pause here for a minute there's a
[1:13:26] man
[1:13:27] that we've all heard his name
[1:13:29] it was a boxer named Evander Holyfield
[1:13:32] and Vander when he was when he was a
[1:13:34] young man
[1:13:36] he was born he was the ninth child
[1:13:39] in this big family no dad he he just
[1:13:42] they were as poor as a church mouse they
[1:13:45] had nothing to to as far as a life there
[1:13:49] they were destined for failure all of
[1:13:52] these kids irvander went young Evander
[1:13:55] went to this boys club and there was
[1:13:57] this Evander called him he said there
[1:13:59] was this white man that came to me
[1:14:02] and he said
[1:14:04] he looked down at him his little kid
[1:14:07] and he says you could be the heavyweight
[1:14:09] champion of the world
[1:14:11] and you know what vander's response was
[1:14:14] he said but I'm only eight years old
[1:14:17] and he says
[1:14:20] the wisdom of this man he says you're
[1:14:21] not going to be eight forever
[1:14:23] and he says you know my birthday was
[1:14:25] next week so I knew that that was going
[1:14:27] to happen so no I'm not going to be
[1:14:29] eight so he goes home and asks his
[1:14:31] mother about this he says hey Mom I says
[1:14:33] I want to be heavyweight champion of the
[1:14:35] world eight years old
[1:14:38] his everybody laughed at him his friends
[1:14:41] put him down but his mom says listen
[1:14:44] she says if you listen
[1:14:46] if you follow directions and you don't
[1:14:49] quit
[1:14:50] then you'll succeed
[1:14:52] so the poor little kid he started he
[1:14:55] started boxing and and he was really
[1:14:57] good he was gifted he came up through
[1:14:59] the ranks he was winning all these
[1:15:01] fights and
[1:15:03] through all the hard work and the love
[1:15:06] of certain people everybody told him
[1:15:08] even his teachers told him his family
[1:15:10] told him you are not going to be
[1:15:12] anything you're going to fail you're
[1:15:14] gonna you can't do it constantly telling
[1:15:16] him this he constantly worked and worked
[1:15:18] and worked and he worked all the way up
[1:15:20] till he became the heavyweight champion
[1:15:21] of the world
[1:15:23] Evander Holyfield
[1:15:25] going on
[1:15:27] he loses a fight
[1:15:30] gets the heavyweight championship back
[1:15:34] loses another fight
[1:15:37] and there was something off in his body
[1:15:41] there was something wrong
[1:15:43] in evander's in his health
[1:15:45] so he went to the doctor
[1:15:49] and went to a few doctors remember this
[1:15:52] is a rich man he's got the best doctors
[1:15:54] his doctor says you are never to fight
[1:15:57] again
[1:15:58] you are never to have this kind of
[1:16:00] physical activity you have heart disease
[1:16:03] you cannot you will die
[1:16:07] Evander step down
[1:16:10] from boxing told everybody I remember
[1:16:12] this I was a big fan when I was a kid of
[1:16:15] this guy
[1:16:16] I was like oh you know it's it was it
[1:16:18] was my favorite boxer and and
[1:16:21] so he's steps away from boxing and as he
[1:16:26] steps away
[1:16:27] the most feared boxer that has ever been
[1:16:33] starts raising up in the ranks this man
[1:16:36] named Mike Tyson
[1:16:38] this guy and everybody knows who he is
[1:16:40] he would just knock people's heads off
[1:16:42] he was Unstoppable Evander Holyfield he
[1:16:47] he he doesn't understand he he wants he
[1:16:50] he wants to box so you know what he does
[1:16:52] he goes to a Revival meeting like we had
[1:16:55] last week
[1:16:57] here in the church
[1:16:59] he goes
[1:17:01] and he gets prayed for
[1:17:05] the man that prayed for him said okay go
[1:17:08] back to the doctor
[1:17:10] and do what the doctors tell you
[1:17:12] Evander goes back
[1:17:15] to the doctor
[1:17:17] doctors do all his tests and other
[1:17:19] doctors do tests and they said we don't
[1:17:21] understand you have no heart disease you
[1:17:24] are 100 healthy you can go and fight you
[1:17:26] can do whatever you want
[1:17:28] so Evander
[1:17:29] gets a title shot
[1:17:32] and this is what I'm getting to with
[1:17:33] this story
[1:17:34] I remember when he did this
[1:17:38] he's going to fight the greatest most
[1:17:41] feared fighter that had ever been and
[1:17:46] he says this
[1:17:48] he says I remember seeing it on the news
[1:17:50] he said I guarantee victory
[1:17:55] what a statement I remember thinking wow
[1:17:57] how could he say that
[1:17:59] that's pretty bold and I thought well if
[1:18:01] I just say some dumb things but he meant
[1:18:03] it
[1:18:05] not the brightest right buddy my son's a
[1:18:08] boxer
[1:18:10] he's bright though
[1:18:12] so he said I guarantee Victory got the
[1:18:17] title shot there they come in the in in
[1:18:19] the ring they fight it out
[1:18:22] he knocks them out he knocks out Mike
[1:18:25] Tyson with a TKO
[1:18:28] in the fight
[1:18:29] wins the battle
[1:18:31] he was commissioned he knew he had word
[1:18:34] from the Lord he was healed he had word
[1:18:36] from the Lord that he was going to win
[1:18:38] and there he is
[1:18:40] beating this greatest fighter this most
[1:18:43] intimidating fighter ever saying I
[1:18:45] guarantee Victory then he comes and
[1:18:47] afterwards
[1:18:49] um the the uh announcer guy they're
[1:18:53] their ringside and he says um
[1:18:55] yes I just want to know how you how you
[1:18:58] could in Holyfield says I just want to
[1:19:00] give the Lord Jesus Christ credit for
[1:19:01] all things and start talking about the
[1:19:03] Lord and frustrated you can see the
[1:19:04] video on YouTube frustrated the guy
[1:19:07] and he says yeah but but that's good and
[1:19:09] that's good but how could you guarantee
[1:19:11] Victory and he said through Jesus the
[1:19:13] guy says yeah but but really
[1:19:16] and he was frustrated Holyfield just
[1:19:18] kept talking about the Lord and kept
[1:19:19] talking about the Lord he was
[1:19:22] commissioned like this man Samson
[1:19:26] so Samson
[1:19:29] he goes
[1:19:31] and he marries this girl
[1:19:35] first of all when Holyfield came out to
[1:19:37] fight Tyson he had in his on his belt
[1:19:41] Philippians 4 13. I can do all things
[1:19:44] through Christ who strengthens me went
[1:19:46] out there and he did knocked him out
[1:19:50] I think the same thing for us you know
[1:19:52] if we are commissioned Holyfield a
[1:19:54] worldly boxing match if we are
[1:19:56] commissioned this book says lay hands on
[1:19:58] the sick and they shall recover I'm
[1:20:00] commissioned
[1:20:03] and you're healed right sister Cheryl
[1:20:06] sister Connie we are commissioned
[1:20:10] just like this man Samson it says that
[1:20:14] he sought an occasion against the
[1:20:17] Philistines
[1:20:20] so Samson makes this trip to to to
[1:20:23] Timnath he's going up there
[1:20:26] and
[1:20:27] he's going up there to get this to marry
[1:20:30] this girl
[1:20:31] and on his way he goes to this Vineyard
[1:20:36] and walking through in this lion
[1:20:41] comes out of the bushes and attacks him
[1:20:45] and Samson under the anointing grabs a
[1:20:48] line and rips him in two
[1:20:52] throws him down beside the beside the
[1:20:54] trail and keeps walking in doesn't tell
[1:20:58] anybody about it
[1:21:00] if that was me
[1:21:03] you're not going to believe what
[1:21:05] happened
[1:21:06] this life came out of grab and ripped
[1:21:08] him apart and oh it was great he doesn't
[1:21:10] tell anybody
[1:21:12] he was commissioned to go
[1:21:14] so he goes and and he goes in and they
[1:21:17] have this like seven day this long feast
[1:21:19] and they have this bachelor party
[1:21:22] and remember back on the marriage thing
[1:21:26] when you marry
[1:21:28] a man or a woman or a girl when you get
[1:21:31] married you're also marrying that
[1:21:33] person's family
[1:21:35] and everything every problem that that
[1:21:39] family has
[1:21:40] now becomes your problem
[1:21:43] it's the truth
[1:21:47] maybe people laugh you young people
[1:21:49] because they the people are laughing
[1:21:50] probably been there
[1:21:52] you do you marry this person you marry
[1:21:54] that person's problems
[1:21:56] and Samson goes in he wants to marry
[1:21:59] this young lady that's not a Christian
[1:22:00] as we would call it that doesn't know
[1:22:02] the Lord and her family doesn't so they
[1:22:05] and her family invites these 30
[1:22:07] Philistine men
[1:22:10] and it's like uh I guess you'd call it
[1:22:12] like a bachelor party they all get
[1:22:14] together
[1:22:15] and
[1:22:18] when Samson let me go back when Samson
[1:22:21] so he he he met this girl he went back
[1:22:24] home he killed the lion met this girl he
[1:22:28] goes back home he comes back for the
[1:22:29] marriage and that lion as he's coming
[1:22:32] back he sees that Lion now it's a couple
[1:22:34] months later he sees that lion dead
[1:22:38] and that lion inside of the carcass was
[1:22:42] a beehive
[1:22:44] and that beehive was full of honey
[1:22:46] so Samson gets down there I don't know
[1:22:48] how he gets away from the bees but he
[1:22:50] gets in there and he dips some of that
[1:22:52] honey out and he eats it and he goes in
[1:22:55] to town and he gives it to his family
[1:22:57] and they eat it and he doesn't tell him
[1:22:59] the story about the lion doesn't tell
[1:23:01] him where he got it he just shares the
[1:23:03] honey
[1:23:03] so they go to
[1:23:06] he goes to this party for his marriage
[1:23:11] and
[1:23:14] Samson
[1:23:17] remember now
[1:23:20] he's commissioned and he's seeking an
[1:23:22] occasion against the Philistines so now
[1:23:23] they have these 30
[1:23:25] young men that come and it's Samson so
[1:23:28] you have 30 Philistines and one Hebrew
[1:23:31] there was probably a lot of testosterone
[1:23:33] going on in the room
[1:23:35] there's a lot of tension
[1:23:39] so Samson's there
[1:23:41] and he says hey he says I have
[1:23:47] a riddle for you
[1:23:49] and they're like all right and he says
[1:23:51] let me tell you if you can answer the
[1:23:53] riddle
[1:23:54] he says there's 30 of you I will give
[1:23:56] you each a a change of garment and a and
[1:24:01] a linen and a linen suit and he says
[1:24:04] there's 30 of you and if and if you
[1:24:06] can't then you each give me
[1:24:08] a linen garment in a change of clothes
[1:24:11] like all right
[1:24:13] Judges 13 12. and Samson said unto them
[1:24:16] I will now put forth a riddle unto you
[1:24:18] if you can certainly declare it with me
[1:24:20] within seven days of the feast and find
[1:24:23] out then I will give you 30 sheets of
[1:24:26] garment
[1:24:27] and
[1:24:29] I will give you 30 sheets of garment and
[1:24:31] change it at 30 sheets which is a linen
[1:24:33] garment and 30 changes of garments but
[1:24:35] if you cannot declare it unto me then ye
[1:24:38] shall give me 30 sheets and 30 changes
[1:24:40] of garment and they shall and they said
[1:24:43] unto him put forth thy riddle that we
[1:24:45] may hear and he said unto them out of
[1:24:47] the eater came forth meat in other
[1:24:49] translations out of the eater came forth
[1:24:51] something to eat and out of the strong
[1:24:53] came forth sweetness
[1:24:56] and they couldn't Solve the Riddle
[1:25:00] and it came to pass on the seventh day
[1:25:02] that they said unto Samson's wife
[1:25:03] enticed thy husband that he may declare
[1:25:05] unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and
[1:25:08] thy father's house with fire have ye
[1:25:10] called
[1:25:11] have you called us
[1:25:13] to take that we have
[1:25:16] is it not so basically have you invited
[1:25:19] us to to come to this party we come all
[1:25:21] this way where your friends we're high
[1:25:23] up in the Philistine Society now you
[1:25:24] creep in now we have to all give this
[1:25:27] guy a bunch of changes of clothes
[1:25:31] now listen
[1:25:33] and if you don't do it we're going to
[1:25:36] burn your family
[1:25:37] and Samson's wife wept before him and
[1:25:40] said thou Dost but hate me and loves me
[1:25:42] not and thou put forth a riddle unto the
[1:25:45] children of my people and Hast not told
[1:25:47] it to me
[1:25:48] and he said unto her behold I have not
[1:25:50] told it to my father my mother and shall
[1:25:52] I tell it to thee you see the pressure
[1:25:54] that this young lady she didn't
[1:25:56] understand
[1:25:58] and she wept before him seven days and
[1:26:01] while their feast lasted and it came to
[1:26:03] pass on the seventh day he told her
[1:26:05] because she lay sore upon him and she
[1:26:08] told them the riddle
[1:26:09] she and he and she told the riddle to
[1:26:12] the children of her people
[1:26:13] and the men of the city said unto him on
[1:26:16] the seventh day before the sun went down
[1:26:20] they answered the riddle what is sweeter
[1:26:22] than honey
[1:26:24] and what is stronger than a lion
[1:26:28] Samson knew exactly how they heard the
[1:26:34] answer because he only told one person
[1:26:35] and he was mad
[1:26:40] he was upset
[1:26:43] he was so upset he said forget it I'm
[1:26:46] leaving and he walked away not only did
[1:26:48] he walk to walk away he walked 20 miles
[1:26:52] fuming I can't believe what has happened
[1:26:57] and he's walking mile by mile and fuming
[1:27:01] and going along the road talk about road
[1:27:03] rage you would not have wanted to get in
[1:27:06] the way of Samson right now
[1:27:08] he was upset
[1:27:10] so you know what he does he walks to
[1:27:12] this 20 miles to this other Philistine
[1:27:14] City
[1:27:16] sees 30 Philistines
[1:27:19] and he kills them
[1:27:21] takes off their clothes
[1:27:24] takes off their linen garment
[1:27:27] comes back
[1:27:29] here
[1:27:31] 's my payment
[1:27:33] still upset goes back home
[1:27:36] then
[1:27:38] he starts they start fighting they start
[1:27:42] killing people
[1:27:44] he takes
[1:27:46] the Israelites
[1:27:48] they um
[1:27:49] they're upset
[1:27:51] Sampson I believe this is where
[1:27:55] the the yeah that's what happened they
[1:27:58] um
[1:27:59] so so the Philistines they they come and
[1:28:02] they
[1:28:03] kill Samson's wife he'd the
[1:28:06] father-in-law had given his daughter to
[1:28:09] another man Samson's even more upset
[1:28:11] they they kill the father they kill the
[1:28:14] girl they're upset that Samson's been
[1:28:17] killing all these people he catches
[1:28:18] foxes catches like 150 foxes ties their
[1:28:22] tail together
[1:28:23] puts a torch in the middle
[1:28:25] sets them loose through the crops they
[1:28:27] burn all the crops and so it starts this
[1:28:30] big battle between Samson and the
[1:28:33] Philistines
[1:28:34] he keeps getting angrier and angrier
[1:28:38] and finally his own people he goes back
[1:28:40] home to Israel his own people sell him
[1:28:43] out
[1:28:45] they bind him with ropes and they put
[1:28:48] him in a place where the Philistines can
[1:28:50] come get him and he's out in this field
[1:28:53] and the Philistines a thousand
[1:28:56] Philistines come walking up
[1:28:59] Samson rips open
[1:29:01] the by the bounds
[1:29:03] takes finds this Jawbone of a donkey
[1:29:06] there and kills a thousand Philistines a
[1:29:09] thousand
[1:29:12] and he throws
[1:29:14] he's sitting there and he throws the
[1:29:15] Jawbone
[1:29:16] on the ground
[1:29:19] and he's tired and he's thirsty the
[1:29:21] spirit of the Lord was upon Samson and
[1:29:25] then the spirit of the Lord leaves
[1:29:27] Samson
[1:29:28] and he's sitting he's sitting there he
[1:29:30] throws his Jawbone down
[1:29:33] and he's thirsty
[1:29:34] imagine this man that had just killed a
[1:29:37] thousand Philistines with the Jawbone of
[1:29:40] a donkey
[1:29:42] and he's dying of thirst
[1:29:44] it shows you when the spirit of the Lord
[1:29:47] comes off of you
[1:29:49] you can do anything when the spirit of
[1:29:51] the Lord is on you but when the spirit
[1:29:53] of the Lord comes off of you just a few
[1:29:55] cups of water
[1:29:57] you're lacking and you'll die
[1:30:00] and we we get excited and like last
[1:30:03] weekend we had such a powerful service
[1:30:05] the Lord was with us we hear all of
[1:30:08] these testimonies and then
[1:30:12] the spirit of the Lord maybe leaves us
[1:30:15] but God doesn't leave us
[1:30:18] no matter how much and Samson was all
[1:30:21] worried about it he said Lord you you
[1:30:23] gave me this great Victory now I'm dying
[1:30:25] of thirst God
[1:30:28] the anointing was off of him God opens
[1:30:30] up the ground
[1:30:31] and the spring comes forward
[1:30:34] and Samson drinks from the spring
[1:30:37] he just goes to show us
[1:30:39] the anointing may be on you or it may
[1:30:42] not be on you but God's still there with
[1:30:43] you
[1:30:44] in both places God did a miracle for
[1:30:46] Samson
[1:30:48] so then
[1:30:49] Samson goes and he judges
[1:30:52] Israel for 20 years
[1:30:56] and then later on 20 years later we see
[1:31:01] this weakness from Samson come back
[1:31:06] where he falls in love with another
[1:31:08] Philistine girl
[1:31:10] he falls in love with another girl that
[1:31:13] was just going to do him harm
[1:31:15] this girl's name was Delilah
[1:31:19] you see the dangers again
[1:31:22] yoking ourselves up with people that
[1:31:24] that aren't believers
[1:31:27] and um
[1:31:31] you get married
[1:31:34] there has to be that Foundation friends
[1:31:36] there has to be there has to be a
[1:31:38] foundation of the word there has to be
[1:31:40] that love between you
[1:31:41] and you have to have Jesus Christ in in
[1:31:44] your marriage or it's going to end like
[1:31:46] what you're going to what you're going
[1:31:48] to hear about right now
[1:31:50] over and over
[1:31:52] this woman these
[1:31:55] these Philistines go to this woman they
[1:31:58] offer 5500 shekels of silver to
[1:32:02] find how Samson is so strong it just
[1:32:05] goes to show you that Samson wasn't a
[1:32:07] big strong man with these huge biceps
[1:32:09] and this ripped bodybuilder because it
[1:32:12] was OB it would be obvious where his
[1:32:14] strength came from then
[1:32:16] but
[1:32:17] he must have been just a small man
[1:32:19] Normal Man
[1:32:21] because she asks him where does your
[1:32:24] strength come from
[1:32:25] so she manipulates him three times she
[1:32:29] goes through they had offered her 5500
[1:32:32] shekels of silver which is probably in
[1:32:33] the millions of dollars
[1:32:35] and
[1:32:36] she
[1:32:38] finally finds that Samson's strength was
[1:32:42] in that vow that he had made before the
[1:32:44] Lord in his hair
[1:32:46] you know the story they cut off Samson's
[1:32:49] hair
[1:32:51] and he is defeated by this Philistine
[1:32:55] Army these Philistine Warriors
[1:32:59] brother Branham said Samson gave his
[1:33:01] strength to God
[1:33:02] but he gave his heart to Delilah
[1:33:06] it was the son of a woman that made him
[1:33:08] weak like any other man and he forsook
[1:33:10] the one thing that God told him never to
[1:33:13] do until the day he had he died he cut
[1:33:15] his hair which was an outward expression
[1:33:17] that he was no longer a separated vessel
[1:33:19] for the Lord
[1:33:21] now he was just like any other Hebrew
[1:33:23] man
[1:33:25] so they captured him they gouged out his
[1:33:27] eyes he's humiliated he gave credit they
[1:33:31] gave credit to their God Dagon for the
[1:33:33] conquest over Jehovah's servant Samson
[1:33:35] they paraded him around showing their
[1:33:38] victory over the enemy and the
[1:33:40] Philistines
[1:33:42] they wanted everyone to see the fall of
[1:33:45] this man
[1:33:47] so they set him up they paraded him
[1:33:49] around and you see that same Spirit
[1:33:52] today in social media and YouTube and in
[1:33:56] Facebook and and they love to see
[1:33:59] someone fail
[1:34:01] especially someone in the ministry
[1:34:04] especially a Christian
[1:34:07] be careful for us
[1:34:10] when one of us
[1:34:12] fails and we all fail
[1:34:14] be careful about talking about it like
[1:34:16] these Philistines did and they they want
[1:34:18] to raise this up and say look at the
[1:34:19] failure so here's Samson he's going
[1:34:23] and
[1:34:25] he
[1:34:28] three thousand he goes to the stadium so
[1:34:30] there's 3 000 people around and they're
[1:34:33] gathered to see this Fallen Hero Samson
[1:34:36] was blind he was weak and he was led by
[1:34:39] a child and he had plenty of time to
[1:34:41] think about that hair that was cut off
[1:34:44] and it was starting to grow back
[1:34:46] but more importantly than the hair
[1:34:48] growing back he had repented of his sins
[1:34:51] he knew he was wrong
[1:34:54] and even the greatest of God's servants
[1:34:56] fall but the truly great ones Adam
[1:34:58] Abraham and Moses and David and Peter
[1:35:01] and Paul those those are the ones who
[1:35:04] fall
[1:35:05] but they're able to get back up after
[1:35:07] they're falling
[1:35:09] Hebrews chapter 11. says this verse 32.
[1:35:14] what and what shall I more say of the
[1:35:18] time would fail me to tell if Gideon and
[1:35:21] a Barrack and of Samson and of jephthah
[1:35:24] and of David also in Samuel and of the
[1:35:25] prophets who through faith subdued
[1:35:28] kingdoms right righteousness obtain
[1:35:30] promise stop the mouth of lions quench
[1:35:34] the violence of the fire escape the edge
[1:35:36] of the sword out of weakness were made
[1:35:38] strong wax Valiant infight turn to
[1:35:41] flight the armies of the aliens women
[1:35:43] received their dead raised to life again
[1:35:45] and the others were and others were
[1:35:47] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[1:35:50] they might obtain a better Resurrection
[1:35:52] and others had trial of cruel markings
[1:35:54] and scourgings Yea moreover a bonds and
[1:35:56] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:35:59] sought asunder were tempted we're slain
[1:36:01] with the sword they wandered about in
[1:36:02] sheepskins and goatskins being destitute
[1:36:05] Afflicted and tormented of whom
[1:36:09] the world was not worthy
[1:36:11] that includes this man Samson they
[1:36:14] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:36:16] in dens and caves in the earth and all
[1:36:18] these things having obtained a good
[1:36:19] report through faith
[1:36:21] received not the promise God having
[1:36:24] provided some better thing for us you
[1:36:26] and me
[1:36:28] that they without us should not be made
[1:36:30] perfect
[1:36:32] on his weakness
[1:36:34] Sampson asked the Lord for strength
[1:36:37] I'll close with this the musicians would
[1:36:40] make their way judges 16 28 and Samson
[1:36:43] called out unto the Lord and said oh
[1:36:45] Lord God remember me I pray thee and
[1:36:47] strengthen me I pray thee only this once
[1:36:49] oh God that I may be at once Avenged of
[1:36:54] the Philistines from my two eyes
[1:36:56] there were two pillars in the center of
[1:36:58] the structure that supported the
[1:36:59] framework Sampson Place one hand on one
[1:37:02] pillar and the other hand on the other
[1:37:04] and he said Lord let me die with these
[1:37:06] Philistines he bowed
[1:37:10] and pushed himself pushed those pillars
[1:37:12] aside one hand on each column the whole
[1:37:15] structure came down and killed three
[1:37:18] thousand Philistines remember his
[1:37:20] commission at the beginning
[1:37:23] was to protect Israel from the
[1:37:25] Philistines and here is Samson
[1:37:28] even in his death
[1:37:31] especially in his death
[1:37:34] he killed more Philistines than he did
[1:37:36] in his entire life
[1:37:38] I know I went through the story quickly
[1:37:42] but what I wanted to say what I wanted
[1:37:44] to to get
[1:37:47] to was he died a penitent broken humble
[1:37:51] and strong person
[1:37:54] his greatest accomplish accomplishment
[1:37:58] was not the Jawbone of the donkey it
[1:38:00] wasn't the killing the lion it wasn't
[1:38:02] embarrassing the Philistines in the name
[1:38:04] of the Lord it was his death
[1:38:07] that Samson accomplished more than he
[1:38:09] did in his entire life
[1:38:11] he was commissioned of the Lord to fight
[1:38:14] these Philistines we are in this day
[1:38:18] commissioned by the Lord to fight Satan
[1:38:23] and we have to the way that we do that
[1:38:26] is we put God first as Samson did we
[1:38:29] fail as Samson did
[1:38:31] but we put God first and when we are
[1:38:35] commissioned when we know that we are in
[1:38:38] the will of the lord we can stand there
[1:38:40] and say Bring It On
[1:38:43] Samson took that Jawbone killed a
[1:38:45] thousand of them and there he was
[1:38:49] called the Jawbone Hill
[1:38:51] there's a name that he called it in the
[1:38:53] Bible
[1:38:54] got thirsty
[1:38:56] the anointing had left in me threw down
[1:38:58] the Jawbone he said Lord I'm dying you
[1:39:00] just had this great Victory but Lord I'm
[1:39:03] dying I need help
[1:39:05] and then God was there also after the
[1:39:08] Revival after after this great move of
[1:39:11] God he was still there even when we felt
[1:39:14] that he wasn't there
[1:39:17] and he's there with us even if we feel
[1:39:19] he's not he opened up the ground water
[1:39:21] came forth
[1:39:23] then he made a he made another error
[1:39:27] but in his death
[1:39:30] was the greatest moment of his whole
[1:39:32] life
[1:39:34] when we talk about giving our lives to
[1:39:36] the Lord
[1:39:38] we talk about
[1:39:40] how Lord I want to die out to myself
[1:39:44] that's a Christian way Lord I want to
[1:39:47] die to the things that I want I want to
[1:39:48] die to my desires of the world Lord I
[1:39:51] want to be that servant to you Lord I
[1:39:54] want to be able to stand against the
[1:39:55] enemy I want to have that relation to
[1:39:58] you with you well we have to die not in
[1:40:01] the flesh anymore
[1:40:02] but die in the spirit die that this old
[1:40:06] man is put away and now Lord I'm a New
[1:40:08] Creation in you
[1:40:10] that's why we're baptized sister that's
[1:40:13] why you were baptized last week
[1:40:15] is to die out to that old person
[1:40:20] and now enter in to this new person that
[1:40:23] wants to serve God that is commissioned
[1:40:25] by God to do his will
[1:40:28] that's why I look at Samson and as I
[1:40:31] read that story over and over and over I
[1:40:33] thought the greatest thing
[1:40:36] for Samson was not all of these things
[1:40:39] that he did it was that he died
[1:40:42] and with his death came down
[1:40:46] all of these Philistines
[1:40:48] and I love
[1:40:50] I just love it
[1:40:52] when it says that
[1:40:53] he sought an occasion
[1:40:56] against the Philistines he wanted an
[1:40:59] opportunity to go to battle
[1:41:02] I think that's where a Christian should
[1:41:04] be today
[1:41:05] we want that opportunity Lord I prayed
[1:41:09] Lord I believe your word yeah Mike
[1:41:11] Sampson I have other things wrong with
[1:41:12] me but I'm trying I'm anointed I want to
[1:41:16] be in your word and then you can come
[1:41:18] before Satan and say Bring It On Satan
[1:41:21] no no because this is not me fighting
[1:41:24] the battle as Samson said he said Lord
[1:41:26] you won this battle not me
[1:41:30] and that's where we are we
[1:41:32] place our lives before the Lord and say
[1:41:35] you won the battle
[1:41:38] and here I am I'm dying out to myself
[1:41:40] like Samson did
[1:41:43] and the Beautiful story
[1:41:45] of a warning be careful
[1:41:49] who you marry be careful
[1:41:53] the boy or the girl young man young lady
[1:41:57] who you date
[1:41:58] because it could end up very very badly
[1:42:04] use this as a warning
[1:42:06] as Samson did Lord I want to be in your
[1:42:10] will you have time
[1:42:12] I want to be in your will and we look at
[1:42:14] Samson's greatest failure was the
[1:42:16] weakness he had through his whole life
[1:42:17] was this woman delightly like the way
[1:42:20] she looked he liked the worldly way that
[1:42:23] she had she was not a Christian
[1:42:27] and he ended up dying for it she didn't
[1:42:30] have the same values that Samson had
[1:42:34] foreign
[1:42:36] to develop those battles those values
[1:42:39] just because you give your heart to the
[1:42:41] Lord there is a time of testing
[1:42:45] take your time
[1:42:47] be careful
[1:42:48] who you yoke yourself up with
[1:42:51] because the consequences are great as
[1:42:54] they were with this man Samson I think
[1:42:56] about Paul
[1:42:57] as I close I think about the Apostle
[1:42:59] Paul and
[1:43:02] this morning I
[1:43:05] I just wept it was early in the morning
[1:43:07] I was sitting in my chair and I was
[1:43:09] thinking about Samson and he was blind
[1:43:12] his eyes gouged out this great man and
[1:43:15] how bad that he looked going going up to
[1:43:18] those pillars being led by the child
[1:43:19] everybody laughing at him whether it be
[1:43:21] like today it'd be a Facebook or or
[1:43:23] whatever the social media would be
[1:43:25] laughing at this man and here he is a
[1:43:27] disgraced sinner going up there and
[1:43:31] being ridiculed putting his hands on
[1:43:35] those pillars
[1:43:37] I thought oh Lord
[1:43:40] you never forsake us no matter how bad
[1:43:44] we've done no matter what mistakes we've
[1:43:46] made you will never forsake us we
[1:43:48] forsake you we leave you like Samson did
[1:43:51] he kept leaving but God was always there
[1:43:53] even to where he's like here here's some
[1:43:56] water
[1:43:57] if you need it whatever you need I will
[1:44:00] provide
[1:44:01] I look at Paul the Apostle Paul was just
[1:44:05] as bad as Samson there he is going to
[1:44:07] Damascus he's killing these Christians
[1:44:09] he's fighting these Christians and he
[1:44:11] gets struck down he becomes blind and
[1:44:13] there he is
[1:44:15] blind in this room
[1:44:19] and not knowing like Lord what what did
[1:44:23] I do there's the blind man
[1:44:27] and the Lord comes to this man named
[1:44:30] ananias and he says these beautiful
[1:44:33] words he says ananias
[1:44:35] he says go to Paul
[1:44:37] for he prayeth
[1:44:40] for he's praying
[1:44:42] I thought how important was Paul's
[1:44:45] prayer that blind man
[1:44:47] and here comes ananias he prays for him
[1:44:49] the Lord restores his sight and he
[1:44:51] becomes the one of the greatest men that
[1:44:54] have ever lived
[1:44:56] because he gave his heart to the Lord
[1:44:58] and Paul was willing to die to himself
[1:45:03] and put God first in all things
[1:45:07] I have communion tonight
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:10] think about
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] the one that
[1:45:15] that came
[1:45:18] that everything points to this man Jesus
[1:45:20] Christ his body was torn
[1:45:23] that bread represents that torn body the
[1:45:26] wine represents his blood that was shed
[1:45:29] think about that as we go tonight
[1:45:34] put him first in everything in your life
[1:45:38] I promise you you will be happy if you
[1:45:42] do
[1:45:43] the Lord will take care of you
[1:45:46] will you do it
[1:45:48] will you put God first will you die to
[1:45:51] yourself
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:54] everybody didn't raise their hands let
[1:45:57] me ask again will you put God first yes
[1:46:01] yeah good let's all stand

[1:48:36] and and it is
[1:48:40] it is kind of funny
[1:48:42] how they won the they won the riddle and
[1:48:46] he just goes and kills a bunch of them
[1:48:47] and takes their clothes off and
[1:48:50] of the dead people and gives them to
