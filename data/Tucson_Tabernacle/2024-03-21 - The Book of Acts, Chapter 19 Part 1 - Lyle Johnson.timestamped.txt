[24:30] request
[24:33] my brother took my father to to the
[24:37] doctors
[24:38] for a checkup
[24:40] and this was the report and I just want
[24:43] to read that
[24:46] he had an EKG which shows he has
[24:49] afib or
[24:51] atrial celebration I said
[24:54] the condition is an irregular often
[24:57] rapid heart rate that causes poor blood
[24:59] flow
[25:00] heart thinners can be prescribed but if
[25:02] he falls or Cuts himself the cause of
[25:05] excessive bleeding so there is a it's a
[25:09] procedure which implants a device but it
[25:12] doesn't always work so
[25:14] the option is to continue just watching
[25:16] how many scheduled for an echo on August
[25:19] 2nd and then see the car cardiologist
[25:22] again show
[25:25] my dad my dad when you see him he's
[25:27] happy and all but I know it's
[25:29] frustrating too
[25:31] to be not be able to do all the things
[25:33] he
[25:34] he wished and the other day he was
[25:35] getting out of the bed he fell he
[25:37] mom can't help him get up sometimes so
[25:40] but I saw him today for just a few
[25:42] minutes and
[25:44] he was more himself today but
[25:47] our hearts say even so come quickly Lord
[25:50] Jesus so feel Stan
[25:53] brother Daniel will take the request
[25:57] timing
[25:59] [Music]
[26:05] God bless you all
[26:08] it feels good to be in the house of the
[26:10] Lord as always for the Eli and family
[26:12] God bless you my friends good it's good
[26:15] to see you again
[26:16] I have a little testimony I was
[26:19] um Sunday night
[26:22] after service I was uh as I was
[26:25] ministering I I felt I felt something
[26:28] kind of funny
[26:30] as as I was preaching and and uh kind of
[26:34] bothered me and then after service
[26:38] as always I love The Fellowship of the
[26:41] kids so we had a we had a bunch of the
[26:43] kids around us and Brother Andy was
[26:45] there
[26:45] and the kids were asking these questions
[26:48] and I'll tell you what I'm so proud of
[26:52] our young people
[26:53] and how advanced they are and the
[26:55] questions that they were asking were
[26:57] just they were really Andy they were
[27:00] adult questions weren't they just really
[27:03] good questions
[27:04] so I left
[27:07] um I left service
[27:09] that night and I I was still feeling
[27:11] funny and
[27:14] I prayed about it and and I thought I
[27:16] knew what it was and and then the next
[27:18] morning I
[27:20] I went to my office and I was praying
[27:22] about in my office and and I said Lord
[27:24] there's there's something there's
[27:26] something wrong
[27:27] and um
[27:29] I was
[27:30] so I went to acts and uh
[27:35] I read acts 18 and I said Lord is there
[27:39] did I say something wrong
[27:41] so I was going through acts 18 and I got
[27:45] down
[27:47] to
[27:48] um
[27:49] verse
[27:51] number eight
[27:54] and it says this
[27:55] and Christmas the chief ruler of the
[27:57] synagogue believed on the Lord with all
[27:59] his house and many of the Corinthians
[28:01] hearing believed and were baptized
[28:04] and as I was researching and ministering
[28:08] on this
[28:09] I said
[28:12] that this Christmas I said he probably
[28:15] wasn't a Jew he was probably someone
[28:18] that was just in charge of the synagogue
[28:22] and I felt like the Lord said you were
[28:25] wrong
[28:26] and uh so I found some of the the
[28:30] research that I did and I went a little
[28:31] bit more
[28:33] and and I did I said something wrong
[28:36] that Crispus was in fact I believe he
[28:39] was very much a Greek Jew believer that
[28:44] was in charge of that synagogue so I
[28:46] just friends I always want to be
[28:50] sensitive to the spirit and if I say
[28:53] something wrong it may not seem like
[28:55] it's that important but this is God's
[28:58] word that we are handling up here and I
[29:02] always want to make sure that I'm
[29:04] handling it with the most reverence and
[29:07] and I never never want to make a mistake
[29:11] I'll make mistakes but I never want to
[29:15] so I wanted wanted to give the church
[29:18] that little testimony how the the Lord
[29:19] did and I felt something
[29:21] remember when I said it and I kept
[29:24] ministering and then afterwards the uh
[29:26] some of the kids were talking and and
[29:29] one of them asked a question
[29:31] and uh
[29:33] she said something on the order of no
[29:36] this isn't Verbatim what if the pastor
[29:38] is preaching something that's not true
[29:42] and I said
[29:45] I told her I said well my message this
[29:48] morning was that you have to have a
[29:51] personal relationship with the Lord
[29:54] Jesus Christ and you cannot rely on
[29:57] anyone
[29:59] to take that place between you and him
[30:02] there is one mediator between God and
[30:05] man the man Christ Jesus and it is so
[30:08] important it's the most important thing
[30:10] in the world that we have our own
[30:12] relationship and if you get anything
[30:14] from my Ministry I pray to God that it
[30:17] will be that you need to meet him
[30:20] because if you're relying on someone
[30:22] else it's going to be sub par it's it's
[30:26] not going to be good enough it has to be
[30:29] Jesus Christ
[30:33] um so
[30:35] this Sunday I asked the church to uh
[30:37] sister we can we'll get to the prayer
[30:39] request now go ahead thank you
[30:41] um
[30:43] ask the church that uh I mentioned on
[30:45] the WhatsApp
[30:46] that I'm going to be ministering on
[30:48] Friday in
[30:50] um in Las Cruces or in I'm sorry in
[30:53] Silver City New Mexico so on Friday so
[30:56] please pray for me
[30:57] that the Lord will give me the right
[30:59] things to say and that I can be an
[31:01] encouragement
[31:02] to the people in those meetings that
[31:05] they could see a Jesus Christ they could
[31:08] see Jesus Christ in me and that that if
[31:12] they don't have that relationship with
[31:14] Christ that I will say something to
[31:16] encourage it
[31:18] sister Amelia
[31:20] texted me that her and her daughter
[31:23] are suffering with pain in their legs
[31:25] and she asked if we would pray for her
[31:28] brother Elijah Murray brother Paul
[31:30] texted me and he asked if we would pray
[31:32] for little Elijah that he has a fever
[31:35] he's not feeling well so if we pray for
[31:37] the little boy
[31:39] and then um
[31:41] sister Rachel Guerra
[31:43] writes please remember my daughter
[31:46] Rachel in prayer

[31:49] days
[31:51] and then brother Silas Lindsey he's not
[31:54] feeling well and his feet are bad
[31:56] tonight if we could pray for him
[32:00] and I think
[32:02] that is all the prayer requests I have
[32:07] so it's Bauer heads
[32:12] God bless you brothers and sisters I
[32:14] pray that
[32:17] if you would have a request that
[32:19] you would have that relationship with
[32:22] the Lord Jesus and you would be able to
[32:25] to let him know
[32:27] but I also know that the Prophet Daniel
[32:29] in the Bible
[32:31] when there was a great problem in the
[32:34] land of Babylon and
[32:36] Nebuchadnezzar was about to kill
[32:39] all of all of these men
[32:42] that Daniel asked his friends Shadrach
[32:44] Meshach and have been to go to pray
[32:47] [Music]
[32:48] so we can ask each other to pray and
[32:53] as we have our heads bowed if you would
[32:54] ever request on your heart
[32:57] and if you would raise your hand in the
[32:59] Living God that's in heaven now will
[33:02] look down
[33:03] and see these raised hands and knows
[33:06] what's under those hands

[38:22] that makes the demons tremble it's the
[38:27] life behind the name that makes a proud
[38:33] heart humble it was God who divides the
[38:38] plan that in all things as a man he
[38:44] would live so he could give give us the
[38:49] life behind the name
[38:54] thank you so much
[38:57] I I was a little slow up here I wanted
[38:59] to be sure you saw my title slide
[39:03] and now we'll advance past that
[39:05] okay
[39:06] so please be seated
[39:09] tonight
[39:11] it's our privilege to continue our study
[39:13] the book of Acts this time
[39:15] we'll be considering Acts chapter 19.
[39:18] there are so many topics included in
[39:22] this chapter we could probably spend
[39:24] every service this month maybe every
[39:26] night this month
[39:27] digging into one after the other baptism
[39:31] adversity being a faithful witness
[39:33] bringing people from acknowledgment of
[39:36] Christ to the infilling of the spirit
[39:39] patience
[39:40] idol worship
[39:42] insincerity in our faith
[39:44] in fact there's too much here to cover
[39:46] in one Wednesday evening service but
[39:48] brother Daniel is graciously indicated I
[39:51] could take more than one service to
[39:53] share Acts 19 with you
[39:55] and this morning I realized that's what
[39:57] I needed to do so with your patient
[40:00] acceptance this is part one
[40:02] I hope you're not in a hurry to get
[40:05] through the book of Acts
[40:08] while you're seated and before we start
[40:10] there's an item I want to address before
[40:13] we dig into Acts 19. after acts 16 your
[40:16] brother came up and asked me after
[40:18] service what's this big deal about Roman
[40:20] citizenship so he was a Roman so what
[40:23] and he wanted to know what was going on
[40:26] there and I looked at him and I said
[40:28] brother I don't have a clue I don't know
[40:31] I'm not going to pretend if I don't know
[40:32] I'm not going to try and vent myself
[40:34] look at it and say oh well it's probably
[40:36] this or maybe it's that I don't know
[40:39] but a question that's asked deserves an
[40:42] answer
[40:43] so I spent some time researching it a
[40:46] quick summary is that Roman citizens had
[40:48] special rights under Roman law
[40:51] they could not be punished without a
[40:53] trial which was the problem which Paul
[40:56] pointed out for the magistrates and
[40:58] Philippi in Acts 16.
[41:01] certain punishments were pro-scribed
[41:03] were forbidden a Roman could not be
[41:06] crucified for example if a Roman was
[41:09] assessed a penalty of death he could in
[41:12] theory choose to go into Exile rather
[41:14] than be executed
[41:17] a Roman could not be whipped or tortured
[41:19] as part of an examination or
[41:21] interrogation
[41:23] this was a common occurrence and
[41:25] therefore a valuable protection we'll
[41:26] see Paul raise this point towards the
[41:29] end of Acts 22.
[41:31] Roman citizens could vote and hold
[41:33] certain offices
[41:34] a female Roman citizen could own
[41:37] property and run a business
[41:41] this suggests that Lydia may have been a
[41:43] Roman citizen since she apparently did
[41:45] both in Philippi which was a Roman
[41:48] colony
[41:49] oh those are the main relevant points
[41:51] that I found
[41:53] before we stand
[41:55] to pray and read our topic first I want
[41:58] to share one more thing with you I I was
[42:00] reading this the other day while I was
[42:03] thinking and praying about tonight's
[42:04] service
[42:05] these are the opening lines from a
[42:08] sermon of brother branham's titled bomb
[42:10] and Gilead preached in July
[42:14] 1959.
[42:16] brother Brandon says and I've often
[42:19] wondered what I would do if I held in a
[42:22] charger a cup a glass as we would call
[42:25] it two drops of the literal blood
[42:28] of the Lord Jesus I've often thought
[42:31] if I would be granted that privilege of
[42:33] packing two drops of the literal blood
[42:36] of the Lord how I would hold that to my
[42:39] heart
[42:40] walk so humbly and slowly watching every
[42:44] step that I would not drop it or spill
[42:46] it in anyway
[42:49] but then as I was thinking that tonight
[42:53] I have before me in the sight of the
[42:56] Lord a greater price
[42:59] than the two drops of the literal blood
[43:02] of Our Lord I have the purchase of his
[43:04] blood his people that he gave his blood
[43:08] that this people might live
[43:11] so he thought more of the people
[43:14] than he did of his own life
[43:16] he gave his life that his people
[43:21] without realization
[43:24] the realization of who I'm standing for
[43:26] this evening
[43:28] with the weight of responsibility to
[43:30] bring you it I believe the lord has laid
[43:32] on my heart to share with you from the
[43:33] book of Acts I ask you to please stand
[43:36] with me
[43:39] let's raise our hearts and our face
[43:42] together
[43:43] in prayer to our Lord
[43:46] Lord Jesus
[43:49] we are so grateful
[43:51] We Are So Unworthy but you've made us
[43:53] Worthy by your blood that covers our sin
[43:57] Lord that you've allowed us to come
[43:59] together this evening Lord
[44:01] blood brought children of yours Lord
[44:05] that we could gather around your word
[44:07] that we could sing and worship you and
[44:09] Lord that you could speak to us Lord I
[44:12] pray that you would
[44:14] anoint my lips Lord
[44:16] prevent me from saying something that's
[44:19] wrong prevent me from saying something
[44:20] that would cause difficulty or cause
[44:22] someone to stumble or cause someone to
[44:25] err and Lord if I
[44:27] somehow do that I pray that you'd anoint
[44:30] the ears that hear that they hear what's
[44:33] behind the words Lord that they hear the
[44:35] intent Lord and that above all we hear
[44:38] from you this evening we commit the
[44:40] remainder of this service to you now and
[44:43] we thank you we are so grateful in the
[44:46] name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[44:52] Acts 19
[44:54] is the early part of Paul's third
[44:57] missionary journey it began in acts 18.
[45:00] so for our topic verse we'll read from
[45:02] acts 18 the 23rd verse
[45:05] Paul had just returned from his second
[45:07] missionary journey coming home to
[45:09] Antioch of Syria via Jerusalem he'd gone
[45:12] there to worship at one of the feasts we
[45:14] don't know which one
[45:15] Paul was certainly a great Christian he
[45:18] was also an observant Jewel trained as a
[45:22] Pharisee
[45:23] acts 18 23 and after completing his
[45:27] second missionary journey he Paul had
[45:31] spent some time there in Antioch of
[45:33] Syria probably several months perhaps a
[45:35] year or two we don't know how long he
[45:37] stayed there
[45:38] pick a number go to the web you'll find
[45:41] somebody that agrees with your number
[45:43] anyway after Paul sent some time in
[45:46] Antioch of Syria he Departed yet again
[45:49] on what we know as his third missionary
[45:52] journey and went over all the country of
[45:55] galatia and phrygia in order
[45:57] strengthening all the disciples it's the
[46:01] exact same route he started traveling on
[46:03] the second Journey with Silas
[46:06] please be seated
[46:09] just as a quick reminder that you should
[46:11] sit close to the front so you can see
[46:13] the detail on these little maps that I
[46:15] put up that this map shows the overall
[46:18] route which Paul and Silas traveled
[46:20] during the second missionary journey
[46:21] you'll notice they skipped Cyprus
[46:23] Barnabas was helping the work there this
[46:25] journey was covered in Acts starting in
[46:27] chapter 15 verse 40 and ending in
[46:30] chapter 18 verse 22. they covered well
[46:34] over 2 000 miles and took at least two
[46:36] years and probably three or perhaps more
[46:43] this is an overview of the third
[46:45] missionary journey which will be
[46:47] starting to study this evening it begins
[46:49] in Acts 18 23 that we just read
[46:51] you'll notice the cities where the
[46:53] Believers were gathered you really have
[46:55] to squint sorry are much the same as
[46:58] those of the second Journey I've labeled
[47:00] a few countries surrounding the area
[47:02] they traveled with modern names so you
[47:04] can get orientation here we'll use more
[47:06] maps as we progress through this journey
[47:08] and they won't be quite as uh small as
[47:11] this
[47:12] I wanted to have an overall idea of the
[47:14] territory Paul would be covering
[47:17] so on to Acts chapter 19.
[47:21] it came to pass while Apollos was at
[47:25] Corinth
[47:26] a call from our opening verse that Paul
[47:29] was traveling throughout galatia in
[47:31] frigida chapter 18 Ends by telling of
[47:34] Apollos a Jewish Believer from
[47:36] Alexandria who would come to Ephesus
[47:38] then went on to Corinth
[47:41] meanwhile Paul having passed through the
[47:43] upper coasts upper coasts simply means
[47:46] an Overland route having come through
[47:48] galatia and friesia
[47:50] it came to Ephesus
[47:53] so this should be a little easier to see
[47:55] acts 18 23 I've show down here we
[47:59] started in Antioch he went through these
[48:01] places he'd been and then
[48:04] Acts 19 1 he goes from there
[48:07] through Asia down to Ephesus on the
[48:10] coast of what is modern-day Western
[48:12] turkey
[48:14] now you may recall that in the second
[48:16] missionary journey the Holy Spirit
[48:19] prevented them from going to Asia they
[48:21] were headed that way they were right on
[48:22] the border and the Lord said no
[48:26] this time the Holy Spirit doesn't
[48:29] prevent him from traveling through Asia
[48:31] and he returns to Ephesus where he had
[48:33] briefly stopped on his previous mission
[48:35] trip he left from Corinth with a kill
[48:37] and Priscilla drop them off on Ephesus
[48:39] and sailed on to uh to Palestine and to
[48:43] Israel to Jerusalem
[48:47] to observe the feasts so here again I've
[48:50] circled deficits this is who apologists
[48:52] arrived it's where Apollos had been and
[48:55] then Apollos went on to Corinth and Paul
[48:58] arrived in Ephesus well so who's this
[49:01] Apollo's guy what what's up why why is
[49:04] this reference here well let's go back
[49:06] to acts 18 24 and we'll just quickly go
[49:09] through that to so that we have the the
[49:11] stage set the context
[49:13] we read that a certain Jew named Apollos
[49:16] born at Alexandria
[49:19] Alexandria was one of the largest cities
[49:21] in the world at that time it's in Egypt
[49:24] on the northern coast of Egypt on the
[49:25] Mediterranean
[49:28] Apollos we're told was an eloquent man
[49:31] and mighty in the scriptures
[49:34] and he came to Ephesus
[49:36] this man Apollos was instructed in the
[49:39] way of the Lord the way in other words
[49:41] in Christianity
[49:43] and being fervent in the spirit he spake
[49:46] and taught diligently the things of the
[49:48] Lord
[49:49] knowing only the baptism of John
[49:54] and he began to speak boldly in the
[49:56] synagogue whom when Akila and Priscilla
[49:59] had heard they took him unto them
[50:02] they hosted him Apollos you've traveled
[50:05] a long way you've come here to share
[50:06] with us come to our home come to our
[50:08] home
[50:09] and while he was there they expounded
[50:12] unto him the way of God
[50:14] more perfectly gently
[50:17] carefully
[50:18] respectfully
[50:19] not for themselves no hint of bride
[50:22] Pride we know this what are you
[50:24] preaching that for you don't you know
[50:26] this uh
[50:29] and sometime later when Apollos was
[50:32] disposed to pass into Ikea that is
[50:34] Greece
[50:35] the brethren in emphasis wrote a letter
[50:39] of introduction on Apollo's behalf
[50:41] exhorting the disciples in Greece to
[50:45] receive him who when Apollos came helped
[50:48] them much which had believed in Jesus
[50:51] Through Grace
[50:52] for he Apollo mightily convinced the
[50:56] Jews and that publicly showing by the
[50:58] scriptures that Jesus was Christ he was
[51:02] the Messiah
[51:04] we learned from this that Apollos was
[51:06] eloquent he was mighty in the scriptures
[51:09] fervent and Spirits boldly knew of
[51:12] John's baptism mightily convinced the
[51:15] Jews that Jesus was a crisis man had a
[51:17] powerful Ministry
[51:19] Peter on the day of Pentecost had
[51:22] results of three thousand converts
[51:25] we're told in many places in Acts that
[51:27] the number of Believers was growing
[51:29] daily
[51:30] watch closely now
[51:33] it may be a little
[51:36] it's 19.
[51:37] 19 or on to Acts 19 the next verse after
[51:39] 18 28.
[51:41] again it came to pass it while Apollos
[51:44] was in Corinth Paul having passed
[51:46] through the Overland route came to
[51:48] Ephesus and finding in Ephesus certain
[51:51] disciples
[51:52] and observing interacting with them
[51:55] knowing something about Apollo's
[51:57] Ministry Paul said unto them have you
[52:01] received the Holy Ghost since you
[52:03] believed
[52:05] they said unto him
[52:07] we have not so much just heard whether
[52:10] there be any Holy Ghost
[52:12] we have no idea what you're talking
[52:13] about Paul
[52:15] Enlighten us
[52:18] and with that answer Paul further
[52:21] inquired
[52:23] and said unto them unto what then or how
[52:27] were you baptized
[52:28] and they said born to John's baptism
[52:32] baptized the same way Jesus was baptized
[52:37] now some sources suggest that these were
[52:40] Jewish people who'd been baptized many
[52:42] years earlier by John the Baptist
[52:43] somehow made their way to Ephesus and
[52:46] never came in contact with Christians
[52:47] until Paul Came Upon them some 20 years
[52:49] later
[52:51] however
[52:54] with the evidence Luke gives us in
[52:56] chapter 18 about Apollos being an
[52:58] Ephesus and preaching the gospel knowing
[53:00] only John's baptism
[53:04] this conjecture seems unlikely to me I
[53:07] personally believe it were converts of
[53:09] Apollos prior to his Enlightenment from
[53:11] Priscilla unakula as recorded in Acts 18
[53:14] as we just read if you search the sermon
[53:16] as a brother Branham
[53:18] you'll find he referenced this verse
[53:20] more than a hundred times
[53:22] and he presented both cases sometimes he
[53:25] says John baptized them
[53:27] usually he says Apollos baptized them
[53:31] the point isn't that he was confused the
[53:33] point is not who baptized them or being
[53:36] dogmatic in one perspective the other is
[53:39] that they were baptized to repentance
[53:41] according to the way that John the
[53:44] Baptist taught
[53:47] and the important teaching that Paul had
[53:49] to bring to them is that they had to
[53:51] receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit
[53:54] that there's nothing more essential than
[53:57] that
[53:58] in fact if you looked at the title slide
[54:01] which I
[54:02] backed up and showed you it said Acts 19
[54:05] part 1 and was subtitled there is no
[54:08] substitute for the Holy Spirit
[54:10] I found that this is a central theme of
[54:13] this entire chapter of Acts every
[54:16] instance every interaction that you find
[54:18] every major thing
[54:20] points to this fact that there is no
[54:23] substitute for the Holy Spirit
[54:26] well let's see how Paul approached this
[54:29] topic of baptism
[54:30] with these disciples
[54:32] so then Paul said John verily baptized
[54:37] with a baptism of repentance
[54:39] saying unto the people that they should
[54:41] believe on him which should come after
[54:42] him that is on Christ Jesus
[54:47] notice
[54:49] Paul didn't berate Apollos
[54:53] he didn't say I'm the messenger to this
[54:55] age don't listen to Apollos he only had
[54:58] a partial truth
[55:00] he did not downplay John's ministry as
[55:03] the Forerunner of the Messiah
[55:05] no
[55:07] he took with these brothers knew and
[55:09] what they had been taught and he built
[55:11] upon it
[55:12] he said about adding light not
[55:15] deflecting
[55:17] not pointing to himself
[55:19] but pointing to Jesus
[55:21] this is a good lesson for us
[55:24] where's a mirror this is a good lesson
[55:26] for me
[55:27] if you take home nothing else from Acts
[55:30] 19 this evening but that you'll have
[55:32] something worth holding on to and worth
[55:34] applying in your daily life in this 21st
[55:37] century after the coming
[55:40] it's all about Jesus Christ
[55:44] it reminds me
[55:46] brother branham's story about the
[55:48] Hereford Association controlling grazing
[55:50] on a federal pasture near the
[55:51] Troublesome River in Colorado you're
[55:53] familiar with the story The Ranger
[55:55] guarding the gate to the entry to the
[55:57] pasture made sure that all the cattle
[55:59] coming in were yet herefords he didn't
[56:02] look for the brand oh this this one is
[56:04] from the Baptist Ranch and this one's
[56:06] from the Pentecostal Ranch and this is
[56:08] from the Catholic Ranch and this is from
[56:10] the message Ranch no
[56:12] no forget the brand
[56:14] he was looking for the blood tag
[56:17] what does the blood represent to us as
[56:20] Christians
[56:22] the life
[56:24] we must possess the Life of Christ
[56:29] his life must possess us
[56:34] and that means the infilling of the Holy
[56:38] Spirit
[56:39] it's not optional it's essential
[56:42] verse 4 was just the opening line of
[56:45] Paul's instruction to these people it
[56:47] wasn't a one sentence presentation or an
[56:50] encapsulation
[56:53] well let's continue on to verse 5. one
[56:56] day these disciples heard this all that
[56:58] Paul had to say to them about baptism
[57:00] they were baptized again but this time
[57:05] they were baptized and the name of the
[57:07] Lord Jesus
[57:09] it shall be light in the evening time
[57:12] the path to Glory you will surely find
[57:16] through the Waterway is the life today
[57:20] buried in the precious name of Jesus
[57:23] speaking of baptism
[57:25] and after having taken this step
[57:28] when Paul had laid his hands upon them
[57:30] the Holy Ghost came on them and they
[57:33] spake with tongues and prophesied
[57:36] young and old repent of all your sin
[57:40] the Holy Ghost will surely enter in
[57:43] the evening light has come it is a fact
[57:47] that God and Christ are one
[57:52] I hear it comes the results of this
[57:54] Mighty Ministry this powerful evangelist
[57:57] Apollos and all the men were about
[58:00] 12.
[58:02] 12.
[58:04] Paul wasn't worried about the size of
[58:07] the crowd he was helping
[58:09] he was one on one
[58:11] with Lydia and Philippi
[58:15] it isn't about numbers
[58:17] it isn't about the one who brings you
[58:19] the message of life it isn't about this
[58:22] preacher or that teacher
[58:25] it's about God's grace
[58:27] and his election
[58:29] another song comes to mind Keep Your
[58:33] Eyes Upon Jesus
[58:35] look full in his wonderful face
[58:39] and the things of Earth will grow
[58:41] strangely dim and the light of his glory
[58:45] and grace
[58:49] well let's pause for a moment
[58:52] consider baptism not from our
[58:54] perspective as Christians
[58:56] of the 21st century or or our doctrines
[59:00] but from the perspective of Judaism
[59:03] in the first century
[59:07] have you ever asked yourself the
[59:09] question why was John baptizing in the
[59:12] Jordan
[59:13] why did Jesus disciples join in that
[59:16] practice early on
[59:18] why were people so willing to experience
[59:21] this right
[59:23] why were these disciples so willing to
[59:26] be baptized again
[59:29] did Moses command people to be baptized
[59:33] for that matter here in the 21st century
[59:36] did you know that converts to Judaism
[59:38] are immersed in water as part of their
[59:40] conversion process
[59:43] that's a different form of immersion
[59:44] from Christian baptism to be sure
[59:47] but it shows the roots
[59:50] in John chapter 3 we read
[59:53] verse 22 after these things
[59:57] came Jesus and his disciples into the
[59:59] land of Judea they'd been up in the
[1:00:01] Galilee they're moving south and there
[1:00:03] he carried with them
[1:00:05] and baptized
[1:00:07] anticipating your questions we don't
[1:00:10] know any more details about how they
[1:00:12] baptized it wasn't in the name of the
[1:00:14] Lord Jesus Christ they didn't have that
[1:00:16] Revelation at that time
[1:00:20] John was also baptizing in and on near
[1:00:23] to Salim because there was much water
[1:00:25] there must have been the time of year
[1:00:27] when the Jordan was full
[1:00:29] and day the people came and were
[1:00:32] baptized for John was not yet cast into
[1:00:34] prison
[1:00:35] then
[1:00:36] there were Rose a question between some
[1:00:39] of John's disciples and the Jews about
[1:00:43] purifying
[1:00:45] purifying
[1:00:47] this is key we often use the term
[1:00:50] sanctification
[1:00:52] and in John 4 we get clarification that
[1:00:55] Jesus was not baptizing people and also
[1:00:58] that this early in his ministry he was
[1:01:00] attracting large crowds John 4 1 when
[1:01:02] therefore the Lord knew how the
[1:01:04] Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and
[1:01:06] baptized more disciples than John though
[1:01:09] Jesus himself baptized not but his
[1:01:11] disciples he left Judea
[1:01:14] and departed again
[1:01:16] and to Galilee and
[1:01:18] on the way he meets the woman at the
[1:01:21] well in Samaria
[1:01:23] well under the law of Moses
[1:01:26] various things
[1:01:28] can make a person ritually unclean
[1:01:31] purification required washing one's
[1:01:34] clothes and once Flash in water there
[1:01:37] might also be other requirements for
[1:01:38] perhaps an animal sacrifices well
[1:01:40] depending upon what it was that made the
[1:01:43] person unclean they might have just come
[1:01:45] in contact with something that they
[1:01:46] shouldn't
[1:01:48] so they would go through this particular
[1:01:51] ritual of purification not just washing
[1:01:55] their hands
[1:01:58] by the time of the late Temple period
[1:02:01] which is some 15 centuries after Moses
[1:02:04] this practice of ritual purification had
[1:02:07] been greatly extended
[1:02:09] through tradition and practice
[1:02:12] let me read a bit about the Jewish
[1:02:15] perspective on purification that the
[1:02:17] Hebrew word used is Mikvah
[1:02:21] it means collection and it refers to any
[1:02:24] Gathering of water for ritual purposes
[1:02:27] now I'm going to read you a little
[1:02:29] excerpt from a a website from chabad.org
[1:02:34] and Chabad I'm not choking that's how
[1:02:37] you say it it's an Orthodox Jewish site
[1:02:40] there's actually a Hebrew letter that
[1:02:42] makes a sound
[1:02:44] and if you have a cold it's a lot easier
[1:02:48] so I I show here images of a modern
[1:02:52] Mikvah and one from the second temple
[1:02:54] period
[1:02:56] a Mikvah we're told is a pool of water
[1:02:59] in which Jewish people immerse
[1:03:02] note that one must immerse not be
[1:03:04] sprinkled or splashed or showered why to
[1:03:08] affect purity
[1:03:10] it is most commonly used by women as
[1:03:12] part of the Nida cycle before she's
[1:03:14] reunited with her husband the Mikvah is
[1:03:17] also used by converts as they become
[1:03:20] Jewish
[1:03:21] in Temple Times this is especially true
[1:03:24] in the late second temple period at the
[1:03:26] time of Jesus and Paul it was used by
[1:03:30] anyone wishing to enter the Holy Temple
[1:03:34] complex
[1:03:36] remember that for the next few minutes
[1:03:38] one had to in effect be baptized
[1:03:41] whenever one wanted to enter the temple
[1:03:44] precincts or partake of sacred Foods
[1:03:47] the Mikvah is surprisingly nondescript a
[1:03:51] humble structure the modern one in the
[1:03:53] image is pretty ornate
[1:03:55] mcvote it's a plural of Mikvah Mikvah
[1:03:58] one mcvote many
[1:04:00] are usually not in a room so decorated
[1:04:03] and elaborate
[1:04:06] its ordinary appearance however belies
[1:04:09] its primary place in Jewish life and law
[1:04:14] the Mikvah offers the individual the
[1:04:18] community and the nation of Israel the
[1:04:22] remarkable gift
[1:04:24] of purity
[1:04:26] and holiness
[1:04:28] no other religious establishment
[1:04:30] structure or right can affect the Jew in
[1:04:34] this way and indeed on such an essential
[1:04:38] level
[1:04:40] than as you would expect it's
[1:04:42] extraordinary power however is
[1:04:44] contingent on its construction in
[1:04:46] accordance with the numerous and complex
[1:04:47] specifications as outlined in holoca
[1:04:49] Jewish law
[1:04:51] however
[1:04:53] the world's natural bodies of water its
[1:04:56] oceans rivers Wells and spring-fed lakes
[1:04:59] are mikvahs and their most Primal form
[1:05:03] they contain Waters of divine source and
[1:05:06] thus tradition teaches the power to
[1:05:10] purify
[1:05:11] no wonder that the woman at the well
[1:05:13] wanted the water Jesus spoke of
[1:05:17] well the Mikvah must be fed by moving
[1:05:19] water and Hebrew that's maim
[1:05:22] which lives literally Living Waters
[1:05:25] not a stagnant pool and it's not simply
[1:05:28] bathing tradition required one to be
[1:05:30] physically clean if possible before
[1:05:31] immersing in a Mikvah you don't want to
[1:05:33] be dirty and get in there and there's
[1:05:35] 300 other people going behind you and
[1:05:37] yeah no no no thanks and that's why the
[1:05:41] water's got to be moving right
[1:05:43] so we can see that a Jewish person in
[1:05:46] the first century would be happy to be
[1:05:49] immersed in the Jordan River for a right
[1:05:51] of purification
[1:05:53] and one like John the Baptist telling
[1:05:55] him telling them outward isn't good
[1:05:57] enough
[1:05:58] one must be intentional
[1:06:00] modern Judaism also teaches about being
[1:06:03] intentional prepared in the heart not
[1:06:05] just an outward Act
[1:06:07] when we lived in Israel back in the 70s
[1:06:09] we were in it's outskirts of Netanya
[1:06:13] there was a a Orthodox Community there
[1:06:16] called koreat songs they were building a
[1:06:19] hospital and my brother Noel was a
[1:06:21] trained lab technician so he and his
[1:06:23] wife Shirley and their girls lived in a
[1:06:26] wing of the hospital that was still
[1:06:27] under construction my brother was
[1:06:29] meanwhile buying all the equipment and
[1:06:32] setting up the lab and getting things
[1:06:33] ready for the hospital to go but he had
[1:06:36] another job
[1:06:37] between the hospital
[1:06:39] and what we call a Yeshiva which is a
[1:06:42] school where Jewish boys are learning
[1:06:44] the Torah the Bible there was a big vote
[1:06:49] and
[1:06:50] if you're if you're a Jewish boy student
[1:06:54] and you're learning these things and
[1:06:56] you're writing out the text of the of
[1:06:58] the Bible that's part of your training
[1:06:59] whenever you come to the four letters
[1:07:02] what we call the tetragrammaton the
[1:07:04] yuenheit but we sometimes say Yahweh or
[1:07:07] Jehovah they never pronounce that
[1:07:09] they'll say Hashem the name or Adonai
[1:07:12] whenever the person was writing that and
[1:07:14] they come to those letters that they had
[1:07:16] to copy
[1:07:17] put down their pen
[1:07:19] and go to the Mikvah and immerse
[1:07:21] themselves become ritually clean
[1:07:25] go back
[1:07:26] and write those four letters and as and
[1:07:29] if if it was a verse where the name of
[1:07:32] the Lord was two or three times they'd
[1:07:34] be making a lot of trips back and forth
[1:07:36] to the Mikvah because it was so
[1:07:37] important to them
[1:07:39] so important the name of God
[1:07:42] so they really liked my brother Noel
[1:07:44] because he learned how to fire up the
[1:07:46] steam boiler in the morning and get the
[1:07:48] temperature just right and scrub the
[1:07:50] place and make it clean and they were
[1:07:52] just delighted because people they'd had
[1:07:54] before him it was too hot it was too
[1:07:56] cold it wasn't clean so when we left
[1:07:59] Israel several years later
[1:08:01] they were really sad to see my brother
[1:08:03] go I don't know if they were sad to see
[1:08:05] Migo but they were sad to see my brother
[1:08:07] go
[1:08:07] and I don't know if it was because they
[1:08:09] needed to find somebody else to run the
[1:08:11] lab in the hospital or they needed to
[1:08:13] find somebody and they were concerned
[1:08:15] about finding somebody to keep that
[1:08:16] Mikvah clean and at the right
[1:08:19] temperature
[1:08:21] well a big difference as you may have
[1:08:23] picked up from what I just described
[1:08:26] going on when we lived in Israel is that
[1:08:28] in the Mikvah in Judaism one immerses
[1:08:31] oneself
[1:08:32] there isn't a second person to to
[1:08:34] perform some sort of a right so in this
[1:08:37] respect John the Baptist was doing
[1:08:40] something new and unusual
[1:08:43] let's briefly now turn to the Gospels
[1:08:46] Saint John 5 1 and then Saint John 9 5.
[1:08:51] because after this it was a feast of the
[1:08:53] Jews Jesus went up to Jerusalem now
[1:08:55] there is a Jerusalem by the Sheep Market
[1:08:57] a pool which is called in the Hebrew
[1:08:59] tongue Bethesda having five porches
[1:09:02] in these lay a great multitude of
[1:09:04] impotent folk blind halt withered
[1:09:07] waiting for the moving of the water
[1:09:08] we're familiar with the story
[1:09:10] why
[1:09:11] were they there
[1:09:14] so they could be both healed and
[1:09:16] cleansed purified
[1:09:18] both conditions of which had to be
[1:09:21] satisfied to enter the temple area
[1:09:24] now
[1:09:25] that was a pretty small Mikvah you've
[1:09:27] got how many thousand pilgrims coming
[1:09:30] into Jerusalem how long does that line
[1:09:33] go
[1:09:35] John 9 Jesus is speaking he says as long
[1:09:40] as I am in the world
[1:09:41] I am the light of the world
[1:09:44] when he had thus spoken he spat on the
[1:09:48] ground
[1:09:49] made clay of the spittle and Anointed
[1:09:51] The Eyes of the blind man
[1:09:54] with the clay
[1:09:56] and said unto him
[1:09:58] go wash in the pool of Siloam which is
[1:10:02] by interpretation sent he went his way
[1:10:05] therefore and washed and came seeing
[1:10:10] this photo is believed to be the sight
[1:10:13] of the pool of Siloam it's been on I
[1:10:15] think this one was uncovered in 2004.
[1:10:19] and a drawing of what it might have
[1:10:20] looked like in the first century Herod
[1:10:23] the Great
[1:10:24] as part of his expansion of the Temple
[1:10:26] Mount and Jerusalem in general had these
[1:10:29] spring-fed pools built near the temple
[1:10:32] so that people could immerse themselves
[1:10:34] and become ritually clean
[1:10:37] on their way to the temple the number in
[1:10:40] size were to accommodate the large
[1:10:42] number of pilgrims and other worshipers
[1:10:44] that wanted to go to the temple
[1:10:47] well back to Paul and the 12 disciples
[1:10:51] they'd been baptized
[1:10:53] but Paul knew that the baptismal
[1:10:56] practice of John predated the sacrifice
[1:10:58] of Jesus giving his life for our
[1:11:01] Salvation it was no longer a right
[1:11:04] symbolic of purification but it was now
[1:11:07] a right symbolic of death to self
[1:11:10] and being brought from Death to life in
[1:11:14] Christ
[1:11:15] so he told them
[1:11:17] and they were baptized again this time
[1:11:19] in the name of Jesus Christ just as
[1:11:21] Peter had proclaimed on the day of
[1:11:22] Pentecost after Jesus resurrection
[1:11:25] Paul then prayed for them to receive the
[1:11:27] indwelling of the Holy Spirit indicating
[1:11:30] God's acceptance of their faith we talk
[1:11:33] about being sealed talking about a token
[1:11:37] sometimes
[1:11:39] there is no substitute
[1:11:43] for the Holy Spirit
[1:11:45] back to Acts 19 and Paul having just
[1:11:48] baptized and prayed for these 12
[1:11:49] believers
[1:11:51] and he Paul went into the synagogue at
[1:11:54] Ephesus and spoke boldly
[1:11:57] for the space of three months disputing
[1:12:00] and persuading the things concerning the
[1:12:03] kingdom of God
[1:12:05] don't be misled by that word disputing
[1:12:07] in Modern English we think of this as an
[1:12:10] argument or a fight
[1:12:12] it's the normal method of pharisaic and
[1:12:15] now rabbinic learning other translations
[1:12:18] use words like dialogue discussing
[1:12:21] reasoning
[1:12:23] the way this works is that one takes a
[1:12:26] position on a point of scripture
[1:12:29] others then attack that position probe
[1:12:31] for weakness
[1:12:32] if it holds up to such scrutiny
[1:12:35] good
[1:12:36] if not figure out what the weakness of
[1:12:38] the error is and correct it not correct
[1:12:41] the scripture but correct your
[1:12:43] understanding your revelation of its
[1:12:46] meaning the scripture is the absolute
[1:12:48] there can be heated discussions
[1:12:51] and disagreements but participants are
[1:12:55] still friends and brothers brother
[1:12:57] random talks about standing toe-to-toe
[1:12:59] with your brother and vehemently
[1:13:00] disagreeing but still loving him it it's
[1:13:03] a method of instruction that they used
[1:13:05] in that day a method of teaching it's
[1:13:07] not getting into it
[1:13:09] pugilism going to a gym and and working
[1:13:13] out
[1:13:14] it's a method or an approach of learning
[1:13:16] and this is how Paul was going about it
[1:13:19] that's what his training was as a
[1:13:22] Pharisee
[1:13:24] when diverse some of the participants in
[1:13:27] these discussions were hardened
[1:13:29] they couldn't defend their stances or
[1:13:32] defeat Paul's
[1:13:33] but they were unwilling to change
[1:13:36] and believe not
[1:13:37] they didn't believe what Paul was saying
[1:13:39] but
[1:13:41] space evil of that way the way
[1:13:44] Christianity spake evil that way before
[1:13:47] the multitude
[1:13:48] they verbally attacked Paul
[1:13:50] they attacked his teaching speaking evil
[1:13:53] indicates this became personal no longer
[1:13:56] a method of teaching and learning
[1:13:58] they reviled discredited publicly
[1:14:01] maligned the way Christianity or that
[1:14:05] Jesus was the Messiah
[1:14:07] so when that happened Paul departed from
[1:14:10] them he left the synagogue and separated
[1:14:13] the disciples the the students the
[1:14:15] Believers the followers of Christ from
[1:14:17] that synagogue
[1:14:19] disputing daily
[1:14:21] no longer in the synagogue but instead
[1:14:23] teaching using this method of dialogue
[1:14:25] and persuasion and the school of one
[1:14:28] torontus
[1:14:32] this continued
[1:14:33] by the space of two
[1:14:36] he had already been in Ephesus for three
[1:14:38] months at least now he's there for two
[1:14:42] years just in this one school
[1:14:45] Paul stayed and taught an Ephesus in
[1:14:48] this part of his journey we later find
[1:14:49] out
[1:14:50] thinking Acts 20 will discover that he
[1:14:53] was there for three years
[1:14:56] so that all they which dwelt in that
[1:14:58] part of Asia heard the word of the Lord
[1:15:01] Jesus both Jews and Greeks
[1:15:05] recall in Acts 16. Paul tried to go to
[1:15:08] Asia but was forbidden by the spirit to
[1:15:10] go at that time
[1:15:11] now he's being detained in Asia for
[1:15:15] considerable length of time by the same
[1:15:17] Holy Spirit
[1:15:20] God wasn't confused and neither was Paul
[1:15:24] we must be careful as our brother just
[1:15:27] Illustrated with uh with what he said
[1:15:29] before the prayer request to always be
[1:15:31] sensitive to the Lord's guidance
[1:15:34] never forget the comma
[1:15:36] in our theology or in our experience
[1:15:40] God is alive and well and cannot be put
[1:15:44] in a box
[1:15:46] now God was about to use Paul's Ministry
[1:15:49] to do something remarkable
[1:15:56] we read
[1:15:58] and God wrought special miracles
[1:16:01] by the hands of Paul
[1:16:04] not just ordinary miracles
[1:16:06] special Miracles unusual miracles what
[1:16:09] does this mean
[1:16:10] so that from his body from Paul's body
[1:16:12] not from his dead body his not grave
[1:16:14] clothes but things he had touched
[1:16:18] were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
[1:16:20] literally the Greek it's a towel for
[1:16:23] wiping perspiration or a napkin or
[1:16:26] aprons the word translated aprons only
[1:16:28] occurs once in the entire Bible
[1:16:31] that's right here it means a half
[1:16:34] girding or a narrow covering not quite
[1:16:36] sure what that is but maybe it's
[1:16:38] something you wore as he worked we're
[1:16:39] told he was a tent maker and the King
[1:16:41] James version the word translated Tent
[1:16:43] Maker also means leather worker
[1:16:46] regardless of the particular craft
[1:16:48] things Paul had touched
[1:16:50] were brought
[1:16:52] to the sick and the diseases departed
[1:16:55] from them
[1:16:56] and the evil spirits went out from them
[1:17:03] in our day
[1:17:05] this is the basis for what we call
[1:17:07] prayer cloths we sometimes take things
[1:17:10] that brother Branham prayed over for
[1:17:12] healing
[1:17:13] and give them to people who are sick
[1:17:15] brother Branham said the scriptural
[1:17:17] basis for this was when Elisha sent
[1:17:20] gehazi with his staff to lay on the dead
[1:17:22] child of the shinomite woman in Second
[1:17:24] Kings 4.
[1:17:27] well this is a Bible study so let's turn
[1:17:29] to the account Second Kings Four
[1:17:31] starting at verse 27. the back story is
[1:17:34] a woman of shooting provided a room for
[1:17:36] Elisha to stay in when he was in the
[1:17:38] area she and her husband had no child
[1:17:40] Elisha promised her that she would
[1:17:42] conceive and she did and bore a son
[1:17:45] some years later out in the field the
[1:17:47] child cried out my head my head
[1:17:49] was taken to his mother and died a few
[1:17:52] hours later in her lap
[1:17:55] she took the child to Elisha's bed laid
[1:17:59] him there
[1:18:00] and got a donkey saddled up and went to
[1:18:03] find Elisha and when she did she came to
[1:18:06] the man of God to the hill she caught
[1:18:08] him by the feet
[1:18:10] but gehazi that's Elisha's servant came
[1:18:13] here to push her away the man of God
[1:18:15] said let her alone
[1:18:17] her soul is vexed within her the Lord's
[1:18:20] hid it from me I don't know why she's
[1:18:22] here I don't know what's going on
[1:18:24] and she said did I desire a son of my
[1:18:27] Lord
[1:18:28] did I not say Do not deceive me
[1:18:32] then Elisha said to you guys he gird up
[1:18:34] thy loins take my staff in thine hand
[1:18:37] and go thy way if thou meet any man
[1:18:39] salute him not if any man salute thee
[1:18:42] don't say hello back
[1:18:44] lay my staff on the face of that child
[1:18:48] the mother child said as the Lord liveth
[1:18:51] in his thy soul liveth I will not leave
[1:18:53] thee
[1:18:55] so Elisha arose in follower
[1:18:59] okay hazy passed on before them laid the
[1:19:01] staff upon the face of the child but
[1:19:04] there was neither voice nor hearing
[1:19:05] wherefore he went again to meet him
[1:19:07] Elisha and told him saying the child is
[1:19:10] not awake
[1:19:12] when Elisha was coming to the house
[1:19:14] behold
[1:19:15] the child was dead
[1:19:17] and laid upon Elisha's bed
[1:19:21] you went in therefore
[1:19:23] shut the door upon them Twain and prayed
[1:19:25] unto the Lord and he went up lay upon
[1:19:28] the child put his mouth upon his mouth
[1:19:29] his eyes upon his eyes his hands upon
[1:19:32] his hands he stretched himself upon the
[1:19:34] child in the flesh of the child waxed
[1:19:35] warm
[1:19:37] of course touching a dead body makes you
[1:19:39] ritually unclean and requires
[1:19:41] purification as we have just talked
[1:19:43] about then he returned walked in the
[1:19:46] house to and fro went up and stretched
[1:19:48] himself upon him the child sneezed seven
[1:19:51] times
[1:19:52] and the child opened his eyes
[1:19:55] and he called Ghazi and said call this
[1:19:57] shunamite so he called her and when she
[1:20:00] was come in unto him he said take up thy
[1:20:03] son
[1:20:04] then she went in and fell at his feet
[1:20:06] bowed herself to the ground took up her
[1:20:09] son and went out
[1:20:13] this is a seemingly strange reference
[1:20:15] since nothing happened when gehazi did
[1:20:18] as a prophet directed it required Elisha
[1:20:21] to physically come and for the Lord to
[1:20:24] bring the child back from death
[1:20:26] the shinomite mother would accept
[1:20:28] nothing less
[1:20:31] there's an important principle here
[1:20:34] something about which we need to be very
[1:20:35] careful
[1:20:37] recall in Acts 5 15 people laid in the
[1:20:40] streets that perhaps Peter's Shadow my
[1:20:43] my ass over them
[1:20:45] there's no spiritual power in Peter's
[1:20:47] shadow
[1:20:49] or an Elisha's staff
[1:20:52] nor frankly and prayer clause
[1:20:55] God does not live in handkerchiefs he
[1:20:57] doesn't live in rocks he doesn't live in
[1:20:59] sticks he doesn't live in church
[1:21:01] buildings
[1:21:02] understand I am not saying anything
[1:21:04] against the use of prayer cloths far
[1:21:06] from it these are mechanisms to inspire
[1:21:10] faith
[1:21:12] when brother Branham would send out a
[1:21:14] prayer cloth he'd send out this letter
[1:21:16] or not this one this is a copy obviously
[1:21:21] but he sent those with perk loss or
[1:21:23] handkerchiefs and it directed people to
[1:21:25] pray and believe and have faith in God
[1:21:27] not in the handkerchief of the cloth let
[1:21:30] me let me read a copy to you
[1:21:35] I'll read it I'm sure that that prints a
[1:21:38] little small for you
[1:21:40] greetings in the name of our Lord
[1:21:43] we received your request for prayer and
[1:21:46] are happy that you are a Believer and
[1:21:47] want to assure you that the Lord still
[1:21:49] heals all manner of disease
[1:21:51] Psalms 103 3 the Lord that healeth thee
[1:21:55] your request has received the personal
[1:21:58] attention of brother Branham and he has
[1:22:00] had special prayer for you and prayed
[1:22:02] over the enclosed cloth or handkerchief
[1:22:04] according to Acts 19 11 and 12.
[1:22:08] just read and request that you wear it
[1:22:11] over your heart and believe God for the
[1:22:15] healing of your body
[1:22:17] please wear it and stand fast on the
[1:22:20] word and promise of God
[1:22:23] be simple
[1:22:25] be natural
[1:22:27] be open-hearted before God remember God
[1:22:30] knows your heart ask God to Search Your
[1:22:34] Heart and then to remedy everything that
[1:22:37] may be contrary to his will and say
[1:22:41] Lord I commit all my troubles and myself
[1:22:44] to thee and I believe thy promise that
[1:22:47] if we commit and Trust thee thou would
[1:22:49] work Lord I believe thee and praise thee
[1:22:53] we are not to be occupied with our
[1:22:55] feelings or symptoms or our faith or
[1:22:58] lack of faith
[1:23:00] but only what God has said the simple
[1:23:03] way is to begin calling the things we
[1:23:05] have prayed for hours and to thank God
[1:23:09] for them before we feel or see the
[1:23:11] answer
[1:23:12] God is faithful
[1:23:14] he cannot deny himself
[1:23:17] the word of God tells us when you pray
[1:23:20] believe
[1:23:22] Mark 11 24. we must believe that we have
[1:23:26] the answer even though we neither see
[1:23:28] nor feel that we have see first John 5
[1:23:32] 14 and 15. well let's just read those
[1:23:34] two
[1:23:35] and this is the confidence that we have
[1:23:37] in him that if we ask anything according
[1:23:39] to his will
[1:23:41] here's us
[1:23:43] and we know if we know that he hears us
[1:23:46] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[1:23:49] the petitions that we desired of him
[1:23:53] go back to the letter
[1:23:55] God says now Faith is Hebrews 11 1. not
[1:24:00] faith shall be for that would only be
[1:24:02] hoping for and not present tense
[1:24:04] believing in having
[1:24:06] Faith begins now
[1:24:09] pray each day at 9 00 a.m 12 noon and 3
[1:24:13] P.M also praying for others is a
[1:24:16] worldwide prayer band we'll be praying
[1:24:17] for you at this time
[1:24:20] we will appreciate your sending us a
[1:24:22] testimony of your healing for it is by
[1:24:24] your testimony and the blood of the Lamb
[1:24:26] that you overcome
[1:24:27] Revelation 12 11. may God richly bless
[1:24:31] you and yours sincerely yours and his
[1:24:33] service brother William Branham
[1:24:37] I want to go back and read two lines
[1:24:39] from from this letter but I hope you can
[1:24:41] see that this isn't some this is an
[1:24:43] Apple Air tag that you clip and forget
[1:24:47] you have a huge part to play
[1:24:50] but what struck me
[1:24:52] the most perhaps about this
[1:24:56] pray each day
[1:24:57] at 9 00 A.M
[1:24:59] 12 noon
[1:25:01] and 3 P.M also praying for others as a
[1:25:05] worldwide prayer band will be praying
[1:25:07] for you at this time
[1:25:12] I wonder how many of us do this
[1:25:15] pray for our brothers and sisters their
[1:25:17] needs their healing that God would
[1:25:19] respond to their faith each and every
[1:25:22] day at these three times
[1:25:26] there's nothing magic about these times
[1:25:28] but it ensures that we're praying
[1:25:30] together and because of time zones it
[1:25:32] means that there's prayer every hour of
[1:25:35] every day
[1:25:36] but only if we do it
[1:25:42] in the summer of 2000
[1:25:44] I and a few colleagues were invited to
[1:25:46] Saudi Arabia by one of the princes
[1:25:49] only time I've ever been in a Royal
[1:25:51] house that had a royal meal in a
[1:25:53] princess house but while there
[1:25:56] certain protocols were explained
[1:25:58] when Muslims went to prayer they would
[1:26:01] face Mecca and kneel and bow and if I
[1:26:04] weren't 73 years old I I'd show you that
[1:26:07] but but I am 73 and I won't I and the
[1:26:11] very small group I was with were warned
[1:26:14] not to stand in front of a Muslim who
[1:26:15] was praying
[1:26:16] this would be an insult as they were
[1:26:19] bowing to Mecca not to one of us
[1:26:21] infidels
[1:26:23] they prayed five times a day
[1:26:26] Sunrise halfway between sunrise and noon
[1:26:29] noon halfway between noon and Sunset and
[1:26:33] at sunset
[1:26:35] one afternoon we were out in the desert
[1:26:37] it was actually a
[1:26:41] if thinking in America in terms of like
[1:26:43] thoroughbred horse racing or something
[1:26:45] we were at the Racing Stable of the
[1:26:48] camels that won the race every year in
[1:26:51] Saudi Arabia and so we're out in the
[1:26:53] desert there and and seeing these camels
[1:26:55] and whatnot
[1:26:57] there's a picture of me on one of those
[1:26:58] camels but he was hobbled so it was okay
[1:27:01] and these guys got out there Matt ruled
[1:27:04] them out right there in the desert aimed
[1:27:06] towards Mecca as the sun was setting and
[1:27:09] they prayed
[1:27:12] stopped what they were doing a Christian
[1:27:14] friend of mine who was with us a few
[1:27:16] days in the trip
[1:27:17] he said words to me something along
[1:27:19] these lines he said Lyle
[1:27:22] what would this world be like if
[1:27:25] Christians everywhere regardless of
[1:27:27] denomination would sincerely go to their
[1:27:30] knees in prayer five times a day like
[1:27:33] these Muslims
[1:27:37] my brothers and my sisters I believe
[1:27:39] this world would be a different place
[1:27:41] maybe that's what will bring what we
[1:27:44] call the Rapture not some doctrinal
[1:27:47] dispute not building walls of Separation
[1:27:49] over disagreements about what this verse
[1:27:51] means or what that quote's all about or
[1:27:54] whatever
[1:27:55] but Christians filled with the Holy
[1:27:58] Spirit
[1:27:59] praying for one another and the burdens
[1:28:01] on our hearts regularly sincerely
[1:28:04] together
[1:28:06] sighing and crying for the sins done in
[1:28:08] our city
[1:28:10] for the sins done in my life
[1:28:12] not waiting for some sort of pressure to
[1:28:16] bring us together that this guy that
[1:28:18] turns his back when he sees you in
[1:28:19] Walmart will suddenly hug you as his
[1:28:21] brother because of pressure
[1:28:25] that's not maybe my opinion takes not
[1:28:29] pressure to drive us together takes love
[1:28:31] to bring us together to draw us together
[1:28:34] if we could love one another and freely
[1:28:36] and willingly and in love
[1:28:39] do this
[1:28:42] what's your prayer life like I'm looking
[1:28:44] in the mirror
[1:28:46] I can tell you right now a confession
[1:28:49] mine is nowhere near what brother
[1:28:51] Brenner requested of anyone who wanted a
[1:28:53] prayer cloth 60 years ago you accept
[1:28:56] that prayer cloth you're accepting this
[1:28:58] obligation to pray three times a day to
[1:29:01] pray for others not just for yourself
[1:29:03] there's an obligation
[1:29:06] I wonder if the people who received for
[1:29:08] our clause and may still be alive are
[1:29:11] still following this request pray each
[1:29:14] day at 9 00 a.m 12 noon 3 P.M also
[1:29:19] praying for others as a worldwide prayer
[1:29:22] band we'll be praying for you at this
[1:29:23] time
[1:29:25] I wonder if there is still a worldwide
[1:29:28] prayer band
[1:29:29] praying every day at those hours
[1:29:33] when brother Brannon would call out a
[1:29:35] person
[1:29:36] tell them their name their address their
[1:29:39] problem the purpose was to inspire faith
[1:29:43] in that person to reach out and obtain
[1:29:45] their healing or whatever their need was
[1:29:49] telling a person their name didn't
[1:29:50] change their name
[1:29:52] didn't tell them something they didn't
[1:29:54] already know but it gave them confidence
[1:29:57] and what they were being told
[1:30:00] so that their faith would rise in that
[1:30:02] moment
[1:30:04] to demonstrate that Jesus Christ really
[1:30:08] is the same yesterday and today
[1:30:13] and forever
[1:30:16] these prayer clause in Acts 19 or in our
[1:30:19] day are not icons or not to be treated
[1:30:22] as relics
[1:30:24] they're a way to inspire faith
[1:30:27] prayer
[1:30:28] prayer and when you pray believe and be
[1:30:31] thankful that he's answering
[1:30:35] but we must be careful or such things
[1:30:38] can become idols
[1:30:39] objects of worship a substitute for the
[1:30:43] holy spirit in our lives
[1:30:46] that's not what they're about
[1:30:48] much of Acts 19 deals with this topic of
[1:30:51] Idols substitutes for the Holy Spirit
[1:30:54] the life
[1:30:56] just like saying in the name of Jesus
[1:30:59] it's not an incantation
[1:31:01] let's read on
[1:31:04] Acts 19.
[1:31:06] verse 13 then certain of the Vagabond
[1:31:09] Jews now we might think of a vagabond as
[1:31:11] a as a negative thing it simply means
[1:31:13] wandering there was people that traveled
[1:31:17] they were exorcists persons who cast out
[1:31:19] demons and they took upon themselves in
[1:31:23] their incantations or spells of exorcism
[1:31:26] ever how they approach this to call over
[1:31:29] them which had evil spirits the name of
[1:31:31] the Lord Jesus saying we endure You by
[1:31:34] Jesus whom Paul preacheth
[1:31:38] and there were seven seven tons of one
[1:31:40] skiva a Jew and chief of the priests
[1:31:42] which did so they did this very thing
[1:31:46] they attempted exorcism using the name
[1:31:49] of Jesus as part of an incantation or a
[1:31:51] spell
[1:31:52] people who didn't understand it isn't
[1:31:56] the name it's the life behind the name
[1:32:00] that's the reason I opened with that
[1:32:02] song this evening and another lesson for
[1:32:04] us today
[1:32:06] they treated God like a tool at their
[1:32:09] disposal
[1:32:12] we are his to use
[1:32:14] not the opposite
[1:32:16] he is Sovereign we are bought with a
[1:32:21] price
[1:32:22] like that quote I read from Brother
[1:32:24] Branham at the beginning blood
[1:32:27] and the evil spirit answered through the
[1:32:30] possessed man and said Jesus I know
[1:32:33] Paul I know
[1:32:36] but who are you
[1:32:37] and the man and whom the evil spirit was
[1:32:40] leaped on the seven of them
[1:32:43] and overcame them and prevailed against
[1:32:46] them
[1:32:48] so they fled out of the house naked and
[1:32:51] wounded
[1:32:52] they should have gone to your gym
[1:32:54] brother
[1:32:55] contrast this with Jesus
[1:32:58] dealing with Legions
[1:33:01] it is indeed
[1:33:02] indeed the life behind the name
[1:33:05] not the name itself
[1:33:08] and and this was no this event
[1:33:12] this became known
[1:33:13] to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling
[1:33:16] at Ephesus
[1:33:17] and fear
[1:33:19] fell on them all
[1:33:22] and the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:24] was magnified
[1:33:26] extolled
[1:33:28] held in high regard
[1:33:30] a little different than how it started
[1:33:32] out with those Jews in the synagogue
[1:33:35] saying bad things and look what happened
[1:33:38] next
[1:33:39] the combined effect of Paul's Ministry
[1:33:41] the special miracles of healing and and
[1:33:44] the exorcism that backfired
[1:33:48] and many that believed
[1:33:51] came and confessed and showed their
[1:33:54] deeds other translations make this
[1:33:56] perhaps a little clearer the Amplified
[1:33:57] Bible puts it this way
[1:33:59] many also of those who were now
[1:34:02] Believers came making full confession
[1:34:05] and thoroughly exposing their former
[1:34:08] deceptive and evil practices
[1:34:11] in other words
[1:34:12] the fear of God came on those professing
[1:34:16] Christ
[1:34:17] they saw there were consequences to
[1:34:19] pretending
[1:34:20] to lacking the life behind the name
[1:34:25] it's a good thing for us to do too
[1:34:27] to come together
[1:34:30] to confess our sins
[1:34:32] to draw close to our Lord
[1:34:34] and to one another
[1:34:38] I'll stop here for this evening
[1:34:40] God willing will continue to include
[1:34:42] chapter 19 next Wednesday night if the
[1:34:45] musicians could please come
[1:34:47] as we progress through the rest of the
[1:34:49] book of Acts consider the circumstances
[1:34:53] the context of Paul's life and
[1:34:56] experiences the context of the Cities
[1:34:59] where the Believers lived who received
[1:35:02] these teachings and eventually letters
[1:35:05] and realize
[1:35:07] there is no substitute for the Holy
[1:35:09] Spirit
[1:35:10] he is real
[1:35:12] he is alive
[1:35:13] and more than ever we need to have the
[1:35:16] life behind the name as we sang at the
[1:35:19] opening nothing is random here it's all
[1:35:22] in God's control
[1:35:23] it's in his hands
[1:35:25] as are we
[1:35:27] if we'll accept his love and grace
[1:35:31] through Christ Jesus if you have not
[1:35:34] done so I urge you to not leave tonight
[1:35:37] until you know you've met him and he's
[1:35:41] met you
[1:35:42] so that on that final day he won't turn
[1:35:45] to you and say depart from me
[1:35:48] not for what you've done or not done but
[1:35:51] because I never knew you
[1:35:53] I'd like to close this portion of
[1:35:55] tonight's service with a song from a
[1:35:58] Billy Graham film of 1965.
[1:36:00] the Restless ones
[1:36:02] brother Francois taught me this song
[1:36:05] when he lived in Tucson as my roommate
[1:36:06] in the summer of 1970.
[1:36:09] it's a song about salvation coming to a
[1:36:11] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:36:13] the song is titled he's everything to me
[1:36:18] you know that I'm no singer I'm always
[1:36:21] in the cracks between the keys if you
[1:36:23] know the song help me if you don't know
[1:36:26] the song Pray For Me
[1:36:31] in the stars is Handy work I sing
[1:36:36] on the Wind he speaks with Majesty
[1:36:41] though he ruleth over land and sea
[1:36:46] what is that to me
[1:36:51] I will celebrate Nativity
[1:36:55] for it has a place in history
[1:37:00] sure he came to set his people free
[1:37:06] what is that to me
[1:37:11] till my faith I met him face to face
[1:37:16] and I felt The Wonder of his grace
[1:37:21] that I knew that he was more than just
[1:37:25] our God who didn't care that lived away
[1:37:29] out there and
[1:37:31] now he walks beside me Day by Day Ever
[1:37:37] watching or me last I Stray helping me
[1:37:42] to find that narrow way
[1:37:46] is everything to me
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:51] and now he walks beside me Day by Day
[1:37:56] Ever watching or me last my strength
[1:38:01] helping me to find that narrow way
[1:38:09] foreign
[1:38:11] and now he walks beside me day by day
[1:38:16] ever watching Norman
[1:38:21] helping me to find that never
[1:38:30] amen
[1:38:33] I gotta take two minutes and give a
[1:38:35] testimony that most of you have heard
[1:38:37] but I think that there's brother
[1:38:38] Jonathan brother Eli salazars you
[1:38:42] probably haven't heard this testimony
[1:38:45] a friend of mine was in Salem Indiana
[1:38:51] you guys know where Salem is right
[1:38:53] Salem Indiana it's north of
[1:38:54] Jeffersonville a little ways and he was
[1:38:57] talking to a um a lady and this he said
[1:39:02] have you ever heard the name William
[1:39:03] Branham before
[1:39:06] and uh this lady said oh yes I have she
[1:39:11] said and I'm pretty sure it was her
[1:39:12] mother
[1:39:14] she said my mother was in the hospital
[1:39:17] and she had cancer and she had friends
[1:39:21] that had heard that this man William
[1:39:23] Branham he had a Healing Ministry and
[1:39:27] and they had heard that he was going to
[1:39:30] be in his hometown of Jeffersonville and
[1:39:33] so these two sisters of the two friends
[1:39:37] of this lady that was dying in the
[1:39:40] hospital of cancer they went to Brother
[1:39:42] Brown's meetings
[1:39:44] brother Branham
[1:39:46] at the end of the service he looks out
[1:39:50] in the congregation and he sees these
[1:39:53] two ladies
[1:39:54] and he says you're praying for a friend
[1:39:58] of yours
[1:40:00] he said
[1:40:02] you have a she has cancer he says you
[1:40:04] have a handkerchief
[1:40:05] take that handkerchief lay it on this
[1:40:08] lady
[1:40:10] and he I believe he gave instructions on
[1:40:12] her to forward a pennant on her
[1:40:15] undergarment
[1:40:17] and that she would receive her healing
[1:40:20] so they brought the um
[1:40:24] the handkerchief back and they told the
[1:40:27] lady that was in the hospital they told
[1:40:28] told her the story
[1:40:31] and uh back then in the in the hospital
[1:40:33] rooms I still even today that there's a
[1:40:35] curtain and you may be in with another
[1:40:38] patient so there was another patient
[1:40:40] that was on the other side of the
[1:40:42] curtain and these two ladies are telling
[1:40:45] telling their friend they're saying hey
[1:40:47] we went to we went to the Tabernacle and
[1:40:49] we went heard this man William Branham
[1:40:51] and he he told us to take this
[1:40:52] handkerchief and end up and to take it
[1:40:55] and to pin it on your garment and that
[1:40:58] you'd be healed and she said of course
[1:41:00] she didn't think that that made sense
[1:41:01] that's a very odd thing
[1:41:03] to do and she got embarrassed and her
[1:41:06] friends were like well you should do it
[1:41:07] she says no I I don't I don't think so
[1:41:11] so the lady on the other side of the
[1:41:13] curtain
[1:41:15] she reaches over opens up the curtain
[1:41:17] she says I'll take that
[1:41:20] and so she took the prayer cloth
[1:41:24] and she did as instructed and the lady
[1:41:27] told my friend she said that was my
[1:41:29] mother and she was dying of cancer and
[1:41:32] she is living today and that other lady
[1:41:34] died
[1:41:36] so so we can see these these prayer
[1:41:39] cloth testimonies they um they're the
[1:41:41] truth let's all stand
[1:41:44] [Music]
[1:41:46] I appreciate it brother Lyle I don't
[1:41:50] know if I have ever met
[1:41:52] anyone
[1:41:54] that has ever been invited to Saudi
[1:41:56] Arabia by a prince
[1:42:01] that was good he uh and I also
[1:42:04] appreciate it brother I appreciate the
[1:42:06] whole thing but when brother Lyle was
[1:42:07] talking about that we shouldn't have to
[1:42:09] have pressure to drive us together
[1:42:12] that it should be love that we have for
[1:42:15] each other
[1:42:16] but I will tell you our Lord God loves
[1:42:19] us so much that if we don't have that
[1:42:23] love
[1:42:24] he will put on that pressure and drive
[1:42:28] us together and it's sad that God has to
[1:42:31] do that to people that we we should have
[1:42:35] that love for one another
[1:42:37] without having to be driven together
[1:42:40] Amen brother Jeremy if you come up and
[1:42:42] close
[1:42:44] prayer a prayer request came in
[1:42:47] during service
[1:42:49] that brother Joe Miller asked if we
[1:42:51] would pray for his wife
[1:42:54] she has she has covet and she's in a
[1:42:56] high risk situation so if brother Jeremy
[1:43:00] as you close in prayer if you would also
[1:43:02] pray for her

[1:47:51] that's what mental whole the whole thing
[1:47:54] always is brother Lyle teaches us it
[1:47:57] means a lot but going back into seeing
[1:48:00] the purpose and baptism is a cleansing
[1:48:04] and something that is done as as to show
[1:48:09] that you're cleansed before the Lord
[1:48:11] before you go on to the next step
[1:48:14] beautiful thank you brother Lyle very
