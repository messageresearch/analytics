wake him up he's telling him he's he's i don't know making fun of them maybe kind of goading them because he knew his god is living responds the answers and he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so appreciate that this we have some requests brother matt mcfadden let me know that brother peter had texted and said sister lydia had a stomach virus or something wasn't feeling well on their trip so let's remember her and them as they travel brother lyle and sister heather he sent a text this morning they started their journey back home driving back from washington so keeping them in prayer my niece eunice and her daughter bianca and little liam they're all not feeling well this morning been sick for a few days sister amelia has asked prayer for her daughter ava she's for healing she's been real sick and for salvation for her the healing of the soul is the greatest healing there could be how many appreciate god has done that for you and if he's done it for you then you desire for others also my daughter elizabeth i've been sick for a few days now and also my sister-in-law elizabeth and uh asked prayer [Music] so and brother [Music] ed douglas asking our prayer for their granddaughter evelyn too not feeling well so i know there's quite a bit of needs but we also have a god who answers brother robert chico and says i want to give god the honor and the glory for a good report from the eye doctors you know he just recently had surgery so also he says received a good report for from his primary doctor for overall health and i get a good report from my primary doctor every time he says i am the lord god that healeth all your diseases sometimes you know there's no nothing wrong going to see the doctor but he's the doctor of doctors and king kings and lord of lords so if you'll stand with me i say lord i have a need there's something that maybe i can't figure out maybe and sometimes a symptom is there but you're not sure what's the cause but god does know so let's just believe that lord as we for some maybe would think is it i'm going to raise my hand again is it seems like sometimes maybe i don't get the answer but lord by faith we raise our hands and we say lord we're committing it to you this morning for by thy stripes we are healed lord it's a finished work it's not something that we work to try to achieve but something that you've already provided lord have let us have that faith this morning to just reach out and take hold of it like that that woman said if i can but touch the hem of his garment i shall receive lord may we be that way this morning you know the need the mental need the physical need the spiritual need maybe some emotions and and changes in life that is hard to go through lord but lord it's all covered under that perfect sacrifice this morning lord and we just thank you for that thank you for your grace and mercy this morning lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated thank you [Music] it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning you know sometimes maybe on a sunday morning it's your only day of rest and you think well i think i'll just rest today but our our home this our place is a house of rest rest for the soul and he can also touch the physical body so i appreciate that so this morning our brother isaiah chisholm down from north carolina and he was here what about two years ago or so somewhere about there and if you remember it was wonderful service but you know god said he would be here and that's what we're depending on i'm talking him a little bit with our brother isaiah and he said you know you put your notes out you get everything but you let god begin to channel himself and he can go and the minister can be ministering and then something will take him over that way because someone on that side needs something then it'll pull him this way then he might go back to his notes and then something else because you're operating the gift of the minister this amen so how many has a need to hear something for your soul today lord i just need that comfort i reading a quote or something that somebody posted and they said talking about that sacrifice that perfect sacrifice he said that every need is supplied you know it's he looks at us and and and sometimes even the scripture this morning you and maybe on your phone or the opening nap and there's a scripture and and it just speaks to your heart and and maybe you had a troubled night or maybe you're you're battling with some and you open the scripture on your phone on your ipad or in your open the bible whatever it is and the scripture you fall on just just ministers to you right then and there but that perfect sacrifice he says a god a just god a holy god how could we enter into his presence but he turns and he sees that sacrifice and he counts you worthy because you've accepted that sacrifice therefore you can enter into his presence and that's how we come this morning so just just lay your heart out before the lord say lord you know my need today and god will then take that one who is called today to minister and meet that need so if you'll stand with me [Music] brother mitch and sister naomi alderson with us back home for i'll call him back home good to have you with us today brother toby it's good to see you trust me you're feeling much better today too amen it's good to be in the house of the lord today amen so amazing grace how sweet to the sweetness of it says you're forgiven you're cleansed your mind whatever it takes that's his grace to us grace how sweet

they know all of our hearts hey man it's good to see you this morning amen i realize that we're not holding on it's him holding on to us amen it's only because of his mercy and his grace amen if you

amen giving us the moment just to be here amen it's always been a blessing and uh you pull and we'll preach amen so i'm depending on you all and y'all looking at me trying to figure out what i'm going to do i hope y'all do your part you know brother browning said that minister could be anointed and he could study and he could pray but he said if the atmosphere ain't right then you say boy he should have stayed to north carolina so i prayed this morning you don't disappoint me because uh i love the lord and i love this message with all my heart and i love to see god's people blessed and i love to see the holy spirit when he could walk down the aisle and minister each and every one of us this morning so i'm trusting this morning that the lord would bless us amen if you will we just bow ahead in word of prayer kind of heavenly father lord jesus we thank you god for giving us the opportunity oh god just to stand here with believers this morning father we thank you o god for giving us strength lord lord we thank you for this message that you have sent lord we ask you father to forgive us for our shortcomings lord and god just washes under the blood father and father we just pray oh god that you just take these dry lips of clay father and you just me move me completely out of the way lord just take away the nervousness so god just let me speak love with the boldness oh god just take away every fear of god and lord let me be a blessing oh god to your people this morning and father i pray that they were poor lord and lord truly our heart could burn as you would speak to us along the way lord we are needed people and we need you this morning father without you o lord we're we're helpless oh god lord we can open the pages lord as many ministers have stood here and they opened the pages lord but we do realize that the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life father we pray that the anointing the word is already anointing father we just pray that it'll come off the pages this morning and touch us this morning meet all of our needs lord don't let us go back the same way we came in let something happen oh god let us truly say did not our heart burn within us as he spoke to us along the way amen you love the lord if you will you just amen turn in your bibles amen to first corinthian the 10th chapter amen the uh the 10th chapter and uh i got it on my tablet this morning so if i miss a word uh we're going to blame it on the tablet it didn't print it up there right so i could see it a little better and man it'll be 62 in a little bit brother one and you know i know what you feel like amen so we just love the lord amen uh first corinthians the 10th chapter and we begin to read from 1 and we read down to verse 12. and it reads moreover brotherings i would not that ye shall be ignorant how that all of our father were under the cloud and all pass through the sea were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our example to the intent that we should not lush after evil things as they also lusted neither verse 10 neither mummer ye as some of them also mumbered and was destroyed of the destroyer verse 11. now all these things happen unto them for an example that are written for our ammunation upon whom the end of the world are come verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall so we're depending on the lord this morning amen let us by heads father we thank you lord jesus for the reading of your word now sanctified lord jesus to our soul in jesus name amen amen you may take your seat praise the lord amen god is good and he's good all the time amen i'm just happy uh to know that god is still keeping me he's watching over me amen he keeping my mind stared on him i got peace in my soul i got rest in my soul man the sabbath is in my soul amen i got peace this morning amen that compasses all understanding this morning how many you got that joy amen this morning that on amen we love the lord this morning and my thought this morning if i could just take my time you pray with me my my thought this morning is what more can god do what more can god do amen now we we see amen i let me read something here amen and and and also if you will uh we look in numbers let's go to numbers the 14th chapter and we'll look at verse one and we'll go back and we just work with that amen if the lord would allow us and as i begin to look a man traveling to different places we see so many fallen by the wayside churches are cooling off uh there's all kind of excuses now people don't hardly come to church anymore and but they love the lord and they're in the message and they got the holy ghost and they're filled with the holy ghost but it seemed like something is it's wrong amen so i just want to share this with you and hoping that it will show us the time that we are living in and we look at uh numbers the 14th chapter and it reads uh and it reads the first verse it and it said and all the congregation lift up their voice and cried and the people wept that night amen now amen now you know it's it's a thing you know how the children of israel how they came out of egypt that's right so we know that the prophet told us that egypt is a type of the world or an organization can you go there so we we see the importance of amen so i i told my wife i was going to minister on but my thought this morning is what more can he do and just look this morning what more can god do he woke us up this morning we have the right mind you was able to drive you was able to walk you was able to eat your own breakfast you was able to take your own pill you was able to do all those things god gave you health and strength god let the blood still running warm in your vain there's no tubes attached to you what more can god do amen god has laid the foundation god has given you eternal life amen god has given us the holy ghost what more can he do with the holy ghost you ought to be the most happiest people on the faith of this earth you ought to be sitting participating on a body change when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost what more can he do you ought to walk around happy you ought to walk around you should be sad amen and that's the way i feel with the holy ghost i know that one moment i'm going to be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye there's bad days there's sad days but what why should i cry there's nothing out of cater all things work together to the good to them that love the lord why should i cry why should i complain because things don't go the way i want why should i do those things i should be happy you know i work at the hospital a matter of fact we are we are building a hospital an addition onto the hospital and in that hospital sometime uh i i goes down the hallway for the first time going down the hallway with the guys we have construction with a hard hat on all of a sudden i noticed the guys everybody taking their hat off and everybody kind of get to the wall and bow their their heads so this is my first time i didn't realize what was going on there was bringing a body through and i just stood there and i just look i said why should i complain you know we complain about this we complain but look look at us this morning god is so good to us every time we breathe out god pushes in fresh air even when we're upset we're still breathing when we're aggravated we're still breathing god good all night long your heart just tick tick tick tick tick all night long won't back up you just take it for granted what more can god do god has opened the way god has sent us a message god has given us the eyes that we could see the end amen amen he sent us a prophet that the seven seals has been revealed the mighty angel have descended why should we be sad when we come to church that's what i don't understand i don't understand but i do understand what more can he do he laid the foundation the song says and he opened up the way what more can he do now if you if you notice the children of israel when they came out of egypt when they came out of egypt uh there was they didn't realize when moses went down to egypt when the prophet of god went down to egypt now i want you to remember that egypt is a type of the world or an organization now brother browner goes on to say that it was egypt he said down in egypt it was pentecost a type of pentecost now we know that the last plague that hit egypt was what death we know the last plague that hit the nomination amen to pentecost the age it was death so we are happy to know that god called us out but one he called us out so when we came out of egypt uh from the world some of us probably just born in the message but a lot of times people don't understand there's a process and people don't understand and the children of israel little that they know when they came out of egypt they didn't know that they had a three day they didn't know it was a 40 40-mile journey but it only took them about four days but because of their unbelief and complaining it took them for 40 years or so in the wilderness going around some people should be much farther in the revelation some people should be much farther overcoming themselves but they are in the wilderness going around in circles well when they came out of egypt the first stage a type you know coming out of egypt it was that came out of egypt was a type of justification they came through the red sea was a type of what ah praise the lord sanctification and being in the promised land was a type of what the baptism of the holy ghost now we don't want to you know y'all i i love the way i love this this morning because you you your very knowledge of the message and i love that but you realize that uh the canaan land was not the millennium now in the millennium amen there's there there's peace amen but people don't realize in cana there was wars and if you get the holy ghost one time you'll see what i'm talking about there's going to be trials there's going to be trouble amen in canaanland but you see the children in israel when it came out of egypt three stages of their journey the earth goes through what three states you talk back to me preach back to me this morning don't be afraid i'm actually you shall preach back to me so the earth goes through what three stages first amen what's the water doing noah day right all right so then amen when jesus came and shed his blood it was sanctification that's right so we know the armageddon amen will burn the battle of armageddon will do away with everything amen and we'll come back down and live on this earth now we know that a a woman goes through three stages and that's why that's right water amen blood and life amen so we found out that a lot of people they try to they try to come from out of the world they skipped over sanctification and they get a message book in their hand and they'll know about the prophet they get the pictures on the wall and they know the quote and there's a good quotas amen they feel the spirit and they'll say and you wonder why and you wonder why in exodus when it came out of egypt the bible said amen there was a mixed multitude that came out of egypt and the prophet of god said when they came out of egypt said they put on their sanders just like the israelites are y'all with me so you wonder why churches are cooling off you wonder why you look brown everybody it's not everybody are you hearing me i realize that there's got to be a change and i thank god he took me through the process he brought me from out of the world well god justified i was justified as though i've never done it that's right he justified me freely and he gave me faith to walk in his word now am i there yet see that's what happened a lot of people just get justified they just come from out of the world and they come and sit in the church and say oh i'm saved oh i'm filled with the holy ghost i mean look around where is everybody why churches cooling off what more can god do what they don't realize people don't realize that's just the beginning you're going through justification but then god wanted to take you through what talk back to me this morning sanctification y'all don't be quiet on me i know we out in the desert but don't be quiet on me amen so god will take us through a stage of sanctification and when he sanctifies us he wants to cleanse and set aside what for service you know and i know you heard this story before it's it's almost like god uh took me from all the world oh if this glass was in the barnyard y'all heard that story before right let me just tell you again i just love telling it how many love hearing it oh my well this glass is in the barnyard well i will go get this old glass out of the barnyard and i'll just pick it up amen and i won't even bring it in the house i'll clean it up but first of all i justified it from out of the barnyard and that's what happened to a lot of us we just was justified and we're thinking that we in the promised land no you just come out of egypt you're not in canaan you're not in the promised land are you with me i hate to preach like this because it used to be people say brother children you shouldn't preach like that we all in the mess you need to preach the third paul uh the mighty angel that sinner then i found out where all the people at because they only had knowledge they didn't have the person amen so amen i get this glass from out of uh the barnyard and i would clean it up i'll wipe it off real good i'll justify but when i clean it up i will sanctify it that's right oh my and what would i do and what would god do for us god forget us from out of the world you know in the world you know can i just be at home in the world you know we might have chased women's mother smoke weed might have did drugs and man might have cursed like a drunken seder i'm just talking about that's what was going on in egypt are you hearing me that what was going on in the system amen but god call us out amen and clean us up sanctify us perhaps we don't you know we don't say foul words anymore you know you don't do bad things no more god just cleanse us real clean and what he would do he was set aside for service he would set us up there for service now we got gas come by the house i got to honor a guest to the house i went to brother ed house yesterday i don't know he gave me one of his old favorite glass amen but you got guests at the house and that glass is sitting there you've been sitting for a long time just clean and set aside not filled with nothing you just you you don't curse no more you don't look at bad movies no more amen you you sing only him you you read your message book but you don't have nothing in the glass how many can say lord take me off the shelf take me off of the shelf and let me be an instrument let me be a part lord i need to be used by you i just don't want to be sanctified and set aside but i want to be put in you and what god would do god would clean me up god would take away he would sanctify me what he would do paul said in thessalonian that you'll know how to possess your vessel in honor and his sanctification in other words god would get me prepared to give me the holy ghost he just cleaned me up huh i'm just walking around sanctified and that's the way a lot of people don't realize they come to church they are just in a sanctification stage let's go back to a mother a mother bringing forth a child you know i was there when the majority of my children was born i was right there eyewitness i would see with my children the first thing i see the doctor said oh you know the water came forth and i'm sitting there my wife just breathing the shoe you know we wanted we wanted a girl but we end up with three boys first and it's almost like we lost hope amen we wanted a girl bad hey man i wanted a little girl cause i thought little girl was a little pretty little thing with little socks on the ponytail i just wanted to hold him by the hand but god said no i'll give you three boys i'm running to this show and you know so i'm i wanted i wanted a girl bad so we're there and and i'm seeing my wife go through all those stages the water than than the blood then the life the baby but i was i was fortunate enough that the lord blessed us my wife had all the children six children normal birth but i was told that there are some mothers go through justification they go through the water to go through the blood but they bring forth a still birth i don't want to be a still birth i don't want to be one that just knows the quotes i don't want to be one that says amen i want to have a life church we're getting ready to get out of here 2 million and a half come out of egypt and only two of the original went into the promised land that ought to tell you something right there i'm look why should i complain man i love this message with all my heart and just loving is not good enough i want it to live inside of me i won't cry to live inside of me i don't want the buzzsaw temple i want the holy ghost to take control of me i don't want no excuses i don't at the brother look i don't i want god to clean me to fill me amen change my nature change my desire my old nature let it be done away not too so but true nature somebody told brother brown so i got two dolls in me he said every time that old black dog is growling all the time he said what did you do he said the dog i feed the most so i realized that long will on this earth it's going to be sticky amen but i thank god for the baptism and holy ghost that could calm me down amen amen i realize we are now for the most of us we are not in goshen valley we are now i'm going ahead of myself we are living in the promised land if you got the baptism of the holy ghost then you are in the promised land now i'm going ahead of myself lord don't let don't just don't let me be sanctified but no one if paul asked the question paul said he he found a a group of baptists that was baptized he asked him he said have y'all received the holy ghost since since you believed they say we had so much hair rather than being holy because they said well how was y'all baptized listen to john baptist and paul had to baptize them all over again so my question is when did you receive the holy ghost now i hate to preach that way when did you knew that your nature changed you don't have the same desire let me tell you what somebody said brother children i know i've been sanctified you know especially as a man this is where i know i've been sanctified i know god filled me with the holy ghost and you just whoa you just passed her tonight you got to look at her something is wrong can y'all help me preach something is wrong when you got to turn and you got to follow her something is wrong that old nature ain't dead yet somebody say amen but i want the holy ghost to take full control amen the holy ghost give us power to overcome this flesh i thank god you should brother children why are you preaching that way i'm just beginning to realize you could have the genuine holy ghost on your flesh and still be lost lord i just don't want it on my flesh brother but i want it in my soul we're getting ready to get out of here churches are cool and all but i'm not cool enough that not i'm not cooling off if if everybody quit that i said well just for me come on this land was a day for me the holy ghost was for me can somebody say man it was given for me that's why when joshua and caleb said we are more than able to take the land footprint is possession we are living in the time church of the going home of the church you say i've been hearing that for a long time let's don't move and complain okay can i say something i i don't i don't want to deal with uh uh political and government but we're seeing these prophecies taking place i think last time i i think i was here you know we see things right before our eyes just little by little god is telling us look i'm getting closer get your house in order though those busts all temple it's got to go i mean the lust for the things of the world has got to go now you look at the children of israel let's let's let's look in our bible i don't know how i got way down there next time coming you might have to put a fence up there because i just walk all over the place you love the lord this morning ain't god good now let's look in our bibles to numbers the 14th chapter and we're gonna walk this down amen if god will help us this morning if you have the time amen i have the time uh numbers the 14th chapter and verse one and it says and all the congregation lift up their voice and cry and the people whip that night now my question is why was they because anybody tell me why was they crying i mean they came out of egypt what was they crying because they they missed the whipping of the taskmaster was they crying because they wasn't in the mud anymore making brick why was they crying and i wonder why people are crying while you're worrying if god don't fix it nobody can sometimes we need to let god have his way and just walk and say lord it's in your hand can somebody say amen look at verse two and all the children of israel mumber against the message moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would that god we had died in the land of egypt in other words it's saying i would that god we would have died in the world coming this stuff here in these message church and they they can't get along i would to god that we have died in egypt that's what he's saying right i'm not making this up would that god that we had died in egypt or would it god that we had died in this wilderness wherefore has the lord brought us into this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children shall be in prayer where not better for us to return unto egypt see brother brown says people dies but spirit lives on i i just i i've seen just recently i i know and i'm not calling names if you're on the internet you know what i'm talking about there's there's folks just walking away from the message just just walking away and and somebody told me a brother told me he said when you go and preach for me he said don't call the prophet name he said why that's almost like you telling me look look you come to my church and will you take care of you you just don't preach your homosexual now you'll be all right that tells me right there you got one of them on the organ you got a big tire pails in there there's a reason why you don't want me to preach that so to tell me not to preach how can i talk about getting on the ark without talking about noah how can i talk about coming out of egypt and don't miss moses don't mention moses brothers and sisters we're living in a time now you can't be ashamed of what you believe i will not i will not shut my mind i told the church i said if i was a muslim y'all would have found out by now i say if i was a pentecostal before i leave here every one of you been speaking in tongues with the initiate evidence of the holy ghost yes sir i say if i was a baptist you will believe in the father's son and the holy spirit i said but i'm a christian and i believe the message of the hour i believe the message of the hour is thus said the lord i'm not ashamed to call his name i'm gonna go matter of fact if you don't want to call it get out of the way let somebody that want to call this name william brown is not my savior but william branham was my prophet i want the whole world to see this i'm not ashamed of the gospel i know what this god had done for me i know what god did in this our way man gave me the holy ghost fill me with the holy ghost are you hearing me i didn't had it when i was in the system i had to come out of egypt somebody say man getting upset when you get upset you get pushed in a corner and you speak in another language and somebody's saying man can y'all help me lift jesus somebody say man a brother came up to the altar he's the brother of children look where i'm going brother he said brother children i want you to pray for me he said every time i get in a tight he said i speak in another language and he's speaking in father son and holy ghost he began to curse i said brother what you need is a nature he said brother chisholm i believe but what is wrong i said you need a nature change glory to god the children of israel their mother that night why did they mama's church somebody tell me why did they mumble you know why they remember because those 10 preachers went over to canaan now i want you to realize i want you to realize that joshua and kayla and the other 10 never saw the promised land they went what moses told them moses saw beyond the curtain of time amen and i believe amen that we had a prophet that went beyond the curtain of time he told us how he's going to be over there and i'm going to fight every inch of the way i'm not going to let nothing cool me off i'm not going to be a person that's sitting in church and warm up you know you got the wrong man i'm going to come to church i'm going to let the water life flow through me god give me joy amen god it made me to be quiet that's

tell me to preach back amen because i'm on the devil's trail amen and you don't want me to preach they say man look i'm not going to be two people but the children of israel they begin to cry and say moses you brought us out here to die and man uh can y'all listen this is what they're saying man why he brought us out here to die i don't even believe in 19 when the cloud i don't even bleed the cloud that didn't even happen he all this right here i my fact on that month he wasn't even there and he was off on this and he was off on that i i said to myself who people thought william brown was huh i said people must have thought he was god or he was jesus christ i said then you might always tear out the old testament because abraham laughed paul made a mistake are you hearing me moses broke a man neck are you hearing me david slept with another man wife amen ain't nobody perfect about the lord jesus christ amen but we're looking at what the prophet point us to those bloody foot prayers we're not worshiping my hand but we have worshipped the lord jesus christ amen i have no desire to complain i don't care what they do my goodness mother i don't have to use you because you pulling me right there mother look somebody just gave me a letter and the letter is for you but my precious brother right here got the letter and the letter's talking about the grand huh and he said what grand honey read this what he's talking about my gran and she said i don't know it don't make no sense that somebody just and and somehow he said well give it to the mother do you understand that and she said yes that's my grands you know why the letter would fight you you know why people don't understand this message because it ain't for you it's only given to believers y'all with the whole church say amen on that hallelujah amen amen amen and you look the children of israel they begin to mumble all that night because 10 of them moses moses sent 12 of them moses brother brown said the bible said moses children but god told moses to do that isn't that some so moses by god told god told moses to get all 12. and 10 of them was unbelievers false or whatever you want to say it there wasn't true ministers and then it goes over to the promised land now they went to god over there moses told them that the land was what flowing with milk and honey somebody don't know what i'm talking about this morning let's get a taste of the holy spirit you have joy in your heart unspeakable joy man you'll be happy when you broke you'll be you'll be happy when you're sad somebody say man amen that's the joy of the lord why are we in canaan amen but they went over there josh and kayla and all of those 10 12 went over there and guess what they saw they saw just what moses told them the land was flowing with milk and honey but two of them had another spirit hallelujah i don't know about you this morning amen i just want birth for my dad amen for my mom but i come from somewhere else amen i come from a much higher power i come from the almighty god you may not believe what i'm saying this morning but i'm going to tell you you come from god and we are going back to god amen i come from that fire and i'm going back to god amen i am i'm happy to know where i come from the world is not mine i don't want the world i want more of god i believe this message all my heart and look i'm going to say what i told the church after the preacher told me don't call the prophet name so i said i'll make some devils mad i say if this mess is wrong then i'm going to hell put a period a comment we're going to put a period it's over huh if if this message is wrong see a lot of people think the message just books and tapes and quotes look i got your place now i don't care if you don't believe what i believe those that believe it say amen this is all we got this is thus said the lord this is absolute this is what's going to get us on the other side if the message of the hour is no other than the lord jesus christ he was the one that broke those seals it was christ it was lamb that opened that book amen but the ten josh and kayla looked over there and guess what they saw over there they saw heartache they saw misery they saw all these disappointment they saw the giants over there but you know what they say we are more than evil we're going to go right over there and we're going to invest our inheritance and that's what you got to do this morning you got to know no wonder brother brown is saying amen you got to know what the holy ghost is and if it's given for you see amen that's why that the the uh joshua and caleb said if the lord delighted in us then he would give us the land see the holy ghost is a day for us the baptism of the holy ghost is a day for me i got to get it i must get it it's a day for me the holy ghost is mine somebody could say man amen i thank god for the holy ghost in my soul i'm a dang to go in the rapture i was not there ordained to go into devil's hell yeah i'm not going to hell i'm going in the rapture and i'm not looking at my mistakes i'm looking at what he did at calvary are you hearing me i'm not looking at my faith but i'm looking at what he did amen if i look at my faith i would say oh my god shame on me but when i looked at calvary i said thank god for his blood amen that given me the victory this morning i got victory this morning church how many you got joy this morning amen you know if the lord don't come the next five years guess what as y'all invite me here i'm still gonna be preaching hard i'm gonna be praising god i'm gonna be looking for him cause my hope is built on nothing like but jesus christ and his righteousness and man and my faith is built in christ i'm going to love him that much more and the more i love christ the more i get on my knees and the devil is in trouble because i thank god for the holy ghost you know the holy ghost is kind hallelujah holy ghost is cut i don't know where i put my bible amen

sheet to go by god act a certain way man amen i'm going to be who i am by the grace of god that's what's wrong with a lot of churches they want preachers that's dignified that's why the church is in a mess they want dignified amen you can be dignified and have all that knowledge and knowledge easily puffed up but i'm going to tell this morning what people need is the holy ghost people don't even come to the altar no more they say well i'm fine because i believe william brown was god's prophet so today that got nothing to do with i believe william brown was god's prophet i must believe that jesus christ died for my sin and i'm on my way to heaven i don't have time to murmur and complain i thank god for the holy spirit down in my soul i thank god is the indwelling of the holy spirit it's
