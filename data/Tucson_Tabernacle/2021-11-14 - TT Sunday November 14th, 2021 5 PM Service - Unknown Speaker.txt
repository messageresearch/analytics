anybody asks you just [Music] let's stand as we sing that one more time reading oh i am [Music] jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just [Music] you believe that you honestly believe that then you have to realize you were part of him in the first place to redeem something means that one time you had it [Music] it's been bought and been paid for to restore something you have to have the original product to restore it back i've always said you can't restore a 55 ford to a 57 chevy they're not the same product if you're trying to restore a 55 ford you've got to start with a 55 port right now you could make something over you could try to transform it but if you're redeeming or you're restoring you start with the original product and when you say i am redeemed you're saying i'm part of him and he's redeemed me back to himself amen it's it's good to know that thank you we don't want to keep them up well maybe we do sometimes if you watch some of the services especially especially amongst our colored bread and they'll have the organist and the piano play through the hole and they'll emphasize and they'll add some you know but no no i don't think we want to do that so good to be in the house of the lord again today and there was an incident out outside right is before service started and fire trucks paramedics police and um just kind of finding out some something had happened there and they were maybe going to look at our security cameras to see if they could see something there but my thoughts was never a dull moment in this neighborhood but as i know down to pray back there i said lord it's satan's eden and but greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world and he's our protector he's our keeper so we'll read this the beginning verse again with again brother jordan john chapter one one through five and then we'll get into another part of of his thoughts the expression of his thoughts is becoming word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and then the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprendeth it not they cannot darkness doesn't understand light and when you start to think about it darkness and light you say they don't know light is greater than darkness darkness cannot you have to turn off the light for darkness to exist so light can exist without itself without anything but darkness needs light to be pulled away so greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world lord we thank you that in a way that you chose lord through written scripture through spoken word lord to reveal yourself lord and then your presence comes lord and you make it real to us lord it's just it's just wonderful how you do things lord and we appreciate lord speak to our hearts today we ask you in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated it's um i was listening to the last part of lean not to thy known understanding and you know as human you you want to be able to comprehend you want to be able to strengthen you want to make sense out of things you know and you're taught that in school two plus two is four and four plus four is eight and then as you get a little further along in school a little older a little to understand more then there's variations but it's still all the same loss but now you get two and a 2a and they put letters and numbers and then they put this and that the other and a lot of us got lost about that time um but it's all something god said in order uh the laws of physic the laws of everything that happens they they can take a rock and shoot it up and and know where they're going to be and when they're going to get there they're watching because god set things in order and god is perfect it's not his creation wasn't let's just toss it out let's see what happens you know he knows every star he knows every everything they can tell you when a a an event is going to happen in space and they can hit it right on you know because god's laws are perfect and and you know so man man at times feels like wow we've really done something and and i i appreciate that man has been able to do the things that they do there are conveniences and things in our lives that is much easier to deal with today you know um if if you uh if you were way back when there was if you wanted light you had to have a candle or you had to have a fire going so the day started when the sun came up the day ended basically when the sun went down but today you can have a factory working 24 hours a day because you can light it up you can power it up god has allowed things for us to do and you go out on a horse i i think about those coming across from the east working their way across west and you read the his the stories and the the things that happened how many months how much time it took you know they might they might leave in in early spring and winter would come and they'd only be halfway across the country and they would have to win or somewhere to continue the journey you know on on the next year or so and today you know in a day you can cross several continents i was speaking with brother rob fero one day and it was a 15-hour flight to go from here to when his daughter elizabeth lived in australia and 15 hours seems a long time but before it would take you three years on the ship so you know god has allowed these things to happen and i appreciate it it's you know just um they have to to do the things that that you know before it took ten men and now you have a machine you press a button and it does it so but sometimes if we're not careful it makes us lazy it makes us take things for granted you know but i appreciate that um so as we spoke this this morning god's thoughts and also when you can look at the scriptures where it speaks and use the word thoughts it's also god's plans there's another way god thought this or god planned this and and again what god thinks and plans he he does it's part it it's it's amazing that when you think about it god can say let there be and there was a lot of times for us is i hope i i want this to happen and i pray that when that time comes around we're able to do it we make our plans we we would like to do this maybe as a as a parent as a as a father and you you'd like to you say i'd like to help the children do this if this would work out we would do that and at times it doesn't work out but god's word says let there be and there is and there's something we can count on so and we know in jeremiah he said i know my thoughts that i have to but in philippians here here paul says philippians 4 8 and brother jordan let me jump around a little bit so you can kind of look it up i we try to send him the scriptures and the quotes so that he can pull them up philippians 4 8 and and uh we know that it's it's their their scripture we finally brethren whatsoever things are true and whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there any be if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things so there's another thought process there to think on those things to meditate on those things to let them fill your life uh we mentioned here the other day and speaking listening to brother lonnie jenkins testimony and he called them prayer aspirants you know when he had that urge to smoke a cigarette before he was chained before he was converted and and he was just coming into the knowledge of the lord he would ask the lord when he'd get that desire he would say lord help me through this and he called him prayer aspirants and i thought to myself that's a good thing to do when you're about you're feeling like you're gonna you're getting into some trouble and you say lord i need some help so when we had the fellowship here on friday evening when i was talking with the family and they told me it works brother this week i've used it and it's really has helped me to stop for a moment so lord i need your help during through this time i need and and and what happened with me when when that song got stuck in my head and i couldn't get out and i said lord can you help me with this and he replaced it with a song of think about his love think about his goodness and you don't know how many times now i have stopped when it starts and i said now wait a minute think about his love and i began to sing that and it changes the whole atmosphere it works as easy as it is to open the bottle of tylenol or aspirin and take them and and it's not one of those things that you know if you get to doing it all the time you just do it you don't think about it you don't study it you don't read all the ingredients that's in it in the bottle every time you just open it you do it now maybe some of you do read all the ingredients of all your medication maybe by the time you finish with the ingredients you forgot what you were taking it for so you don't i don't know but we just get to it and that's how it should be with god it should be a natural thing where you just say yes lord and we take it because see you're part of them he said let there be and there was now sometimes we want that let there be to be now instant like when you flick on the switch and the light turns on but we don't know how much time went from when he said let there be but it went into motion it began to work so and micah chapter 4 verse 12 that uh here it says but they know not the thoughts of the lord neither understand they they his counsel and micah here saying there are those that don't know that but we do he says for he shall gather them as a sheaves under the floor but he said they know not they don't understand his counsel and in by the grace of god and his mercy because you were part of him he shares with you he comes down to visit abraham and he says according to the time of life you know i'm going to visit you but then he says shall i share my secrets with abraham he calls moses up onto the mountain and he's lip to ear all the way into our day he still speaks he still makes himself known he still talks to you listening to to the end part there of of lean not to their own understanding brother branham is ministering at the very end of the service and he begins to call out and he begins to tell them their name where they're from and everything about him he's still the same yesterday today and forever he knows he can reach in and diagnose the situation and you know we we're we're grateful we watch them outside trying to take care of and then we watched the police walking up and down the street as they were looking to their evidence as best as they can but we have one that knows all things the cause the root the effect you know in our our places to have confidence and trust in him and he says in isaiah 55 8-11 for my thoughts are not your thoughts and i'm glad that god doesn't have to deal with some other things in this sense although he did when he walked in flesh and sometimes that's hard to understand that god himself would put himself in human flesh to be tested tempted tried the same way we are if he stepped on on a rock barefooted it hurt him he felt it if he cut himself he bled he said i'm tired i i'm going to lay myself to sleep he was going across on the ship and he lay down to rest so that he could understand and be touched by the feeling of our infirmities yet he's the one that spoke and the worlds were made you would say well how because he wanted to restore the fellowship with his children so he says my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the lord he said for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts a little example here brother branham says we will travel like a thought brother lyle how fast approximately how many miles per hour does a rocket go when whether it's going to the moon you have any idea though about 25 000. most of us have never been that fast you know in fact some of us in the mail outside of an airplane but hopefully driving you've never even been 100. yeah well i'm not going to say some of you may have some you've got to look like oh yes i have but to think 25 000 miles you really can't comprehend that how fast that is to go travel that many miles from to hit from earth to hit this proper spot to land on the moon but branham says you'll travel like a thought i would like to be in australia right now and you're there brother aaron is that possible with god all things are possible and he shows us in the scripture when philip is out there and he says now go over there and actually know philip is running next to that eunuch because god is the same yesterday today and forever so see he says my thoughts are your thoughts he goes the way i work is different than what you you're limited you're bound to this flesh to this earth but he gives us glimpses he gives us a way to see to to say yes lord that is possible he said for as the rain cometh down the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater then he eye like this so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto i sent it how many knows that you're one of those you are prosper or god has sent because he said you and you all that were poured all that the father has given me just just some scriptures here psalms 94 19. david looks at and says it this way in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul so we're looking at thoughts in a little different line right here the human thought sometimes our thoughts are are very human there's anguish in them there's hurts in them there's there's things going on but then david says like thy comforts delight my soul because he's remembering what god has said he's taking what god has said and said those are the things that are going to comfort me those are the things that i'm going to be encouraged those are the things that are going to strengthen me what god has said about me brother branham there in the end there he's he's ministering at the end of the service and he begins to call out just he said i just want to show you as he's speaking uh that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he and he's praying for some folks and he begins now now you he said uh your name is and he would say their name and talk where they're from you're not from here you're from california oh i see you're a minister also and he begins to tell because god is showing that he's able that he still does those things he can he can read he can know who you are and he's just encouraging us to believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever because the god that many many today know is just a god of history just a god of the ministry just a god of the priest or this but no he's a god of each individual of each person see this body here when when i take a breath of air whether i breathe it through my nose or my mouth it affects my whole body when you drink water it goes down through the throat works the way but it affects the whole body what god is doing is for each and every one you know the inspiration the life and all is for everyone to receive every part of the body when you're taking you eat and the minerals the vitamins whatever you take it goes and it affects and strengthens the whole body and that's why david said in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul and and just sometimes we have to stop and say lord what your word says what's your word says more than what i'm going through right now psalms 33 11. the counsel of the lord standeth forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations the counsel of the lord stands forever there's no shadow of turning there's no darkness in his light it is constant it's pure it's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't have to go back and say you know what yeah you stumped me with that one let me go back and let's work this out you know we were working on this and this is what we were hoping for but this is what we got so now we got to work on it again you know if you read the history of many of the inventions there was a lot of failures before they got the product there was a lot of testing a lot of trying a lot of this a lot of trial and error if you want to call it but in god the first time it was right he didn't have to change it and that's this is the counsel of the lord standeth forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations and i appreciate and just just thinking of that along with being redeemed being restored back that's what redemption is being restored back to what was yours in the first place it in in in in that expression of being restored being brought back it's today in in in america especially and actually and all over the world it's really gotten around is going back and trying to restore to the native tribes to the different ones who things were taken from who who they were they were treated wrong and all and and i know in all of that there's people that take full advantage of it and they try to get a portion of it when we had this well i guess that would have been early 80s maybe mid 80s all the chemical that got into the ground and they're in the airport and all that there and people were becoming sick and and all that happened and that did happen but boy all the people did try to get a portion of it there's a couple guys at our work we we worked off of there off of valencia and he said are you going to put your name in that area i said well i've never lived there that was you know i never drank that water and never goes yeah but there's a chance of getting money go put your name in there you know that's what he said there's a chance of being receiving something out of it i said that's not the idea of that it's to restore to those who were hurt who had a loss and he was no i'm going to go over there and get what i can that's satan's eating but in god's kingdom it's his children that have been restored so just think about that restoration going back and and brother nathan talk got into that going back to to eden that fellowship that god had with his children that time together that that he desires and we talk about many times mention brother branham when he he's in that storm and it's coming up and and the lord is enjoying the fellowship coming down and spending time with a man because brother branham was a man he was human god called man no question about it and god is having fellowship with him and he says hey hey don't answer the door right now i'm having fellowship with you don't take that phone call i'm having fellowship with you how easy it is to get get pulled aside isn't it at times but he said just speak to the storm and let's continue to have fellowship and he desires that you know uh uh and and i know i just you can get distracted and then sometimes you know if you're at work and sometimes i'll you're listening to a song and then a phone call has to come through because you're at work you know you've got to stop and do that i understand those things but there are some times that none of this should matter when we're fellowshipping with god it should be our hearts because that's his heart's desire so we're going to go to psalms 139 and david a man after god's own heart david not a perfect man i i i love that the scripture shows both sides or else we'd have a total wrong impression of people whose names are in the scriptures if didn't show both sides while we read was peter's letters at the end or you know david's i could run leap overall run through a troop but david had his down days his hard days his his frustrated days you know in in if you go back and read in in the history and the recorded history of any servant of god they had their hard times they had their failures they had their days where they want to throw their hands up and maybe to throw a hands up and say i quit i'm not gonna do this no more brother green tells in his testimony after sister green and the girls left the house and he took his gun and he was walking out to the back to where the wash was and he was going to take his life down he said i've had enough i can't take this anymore and he said well that'll never happen to me if you live long enough in life there are times when you just had enough when it gets hard and and he talks about it he walks out and he gets ready to head over that way he said he'll take him a few days and they'll find me eventually and you know that was his reason that was his thinking brother adam reaches up to touch that line to take his life because of all that just gone through he was going to take his life took the gun why because we're human but i like that the scripture shows both sides and you say well i'll never come to be who he no he was he was human like us he had his time sometimes down times but the story there with brother green and i'm sure most of you have heard it but he starts to walk around and that little whirlwind comes up and he tries to walk around the tree and the whirlwind goes that way so he goes this way and it comes back this way and at two or three times before he realized uh that's not a happy name by accident and he talked to god there and he said well then then do some he said he felt when his nerves and everything got put back together he's still the same yesterday today forever there's there's testimonies and i couldn't hear the testimonies because they were not recorded but god still does things you know things that we've got to see things that we've got to witness things in our own personal lives and and you know he's jesus christ the same but here david a man after god's own heart but he still had his failures his down times i mean i pray that it hasn't happened to any of us here we had somebody put to death so we could have what they have but david did david had a man's life taken so he could have his wife boy would that make a great news story today david would be tried and everybody would be you know and some of the lawyers would try to get on his side so that they could make some money because that's what most of it is about and how would it go but david has something about in his heart which is an attribute of god they could say i'm sorry and that's why he was a man after god's own heart but david says here in verse 1 starting in psalms 130 oh lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting and my uprising thou understand is my thought afar off you can't hide from god yeah god god can show someone exactly he can he can show somebody a dream uh uh and and and tell the dream back to the person we see it in scripture i was listening to the youth service part of the youth services that they had in south carolina brother watkins brother jason watkins ministered the first night and it was a wonderful service just just hear the testimonies of god and all but brother jason has has a gift in him to see a dream and to tell the dream back all that tells me is jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed he's still god and and and so here he says thou knowest my down sitting in my uprising thou understand if my thoughts are far off and that's why we put everything under the blood because sometimes our thoughts are not pure they're not good but we put everything under the blood okay thou come pass it to my path and my line down and are acquainted with all my ways now there she sit in the back over there i was underwear my wife i was looking over here she was there there is somebody who is acquainted with all my ways and she'll tell you they're all perfect they're all good they're all great why do you laugh those were my girls i think were laughing but no she knows she knows me good and well and acquainted with all my ways and and and um man i'm gonna get in trouble anyway so she does her best to fix me up to straighten me out too to make me a better person you know and i know that in her heart she doesn't want to embarrass me in other does she want to be embarrassed of me and it happens and things do happen but david is saying here look at this god is acquainted with your ways don't get nervous about it because he's made a provision and the reason he's acquainted with your is because he wore and walked in a body of flesh to understand your ways to understand what it is there says he says you keep watch over my steps and my sleep and have knowledge of all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but thou but lo lord thou knowest it all together brother branham says say what the word says say what the word says because sometimes my words would not say what the word says lord i just don't understand how you could fix this i don't see how this situation could be better i don't understand but that's not what god's word says god's word says i can do all things through christ who strengthens me and this here david is saying that but but god has given us a key it through through a message it says there thou has beset behind beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me he says you're in front of me you're behind me you watch over me now sometimes we get a little nervous about that worry about it there's an eye watching you but i'm glad he watches over us i'm glad that he reaches down during our day and says don't do that son don't do that but honor you ought not to act that way you have a chance to make it right it's not held against you such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it brother brandon was talking to brother green on that i believe the one of the trips when they were hunting in canada and brother brown tells brother green he says people would like to know the future people goes but they really don't want to and so he said like if i told you brother greene the next time you were going to get into a car there's going to be an accident you would never want to get in that car brother green talks about i said would this be the day would this you would live in fear you would live in nervousness you know what i'm saying have any child around her tell brother braham don't tell me don't tell me don't tell me let me live by faith let me walk saying god has it all under control and i'm trusting in him david knew he had been anointed king prophet aaron had come and anointed him the oil inning and i'm sure in david's mind at that time everything was just going to be awesome great no problems i'm going to be the king. chloe and asher are here and right now papa can do everything but they're going to get up a little bit get a little older and they're going to rise there's a lot of things papa can't do but i'm papa amos is daddy okay that's how we keep them separate they're gonna say you know papa can't do everything he's not as as big as as strong he's he's shrunken in time it's amazing how that stuff works but we have a god that has never failed a god who is is is is great from day one if i could say that to now an unfailing god he says such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it he says i cannot i cannot apprehend in what manner thou dost so presently know all things another way to say that you know it all it's it's he goes and i just can't understand and comprehend that but i can trust him i can lay my confidence i can cast my cares upon him because he knows all things whether shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i free flee from thy presence he says if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there he says you got it all covered from the top to the bottom from the side to the side in between and every angle and every part of it even there thy hand shall lead me and thy right hand shall hold me remember you're a child of god you're a part of god you're an expression of god me yes you if there's something in your heart that says amen to the word of god that's because there's a part of god responding that's what it is you have to understand it why can't i go out and be happy in the world because there's a part of god of me that doesn't like them that has kept you you've made your mistakes you've been in places you shouldn't have gone to but god has reached out and drawn you back because you're part of him if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me you can't hide from god he says darkness will cover me he says but even at night your light is greater than that he says yea the darkness height is not from thee but the night shineth as a day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee god doesn't have to take a flashlight put on night goggles do anything like that because he's god lord do you understand what i'm going through do you do have you had these feelings brother jordan i'm going to give you a scripture if you can put in psalms 115. let's look at that verse i believe it starts at verse 9. you've heard this but i just want to remind you when i asked the lord do you know my name do you know where i live sat down and the bible opens to this scripture o israel trust thou in the lord he is their help and their shield o house of aaron trust in the lord he is their help and their shield ye that fear the lord trust in the lord he is their help and their shield let's go one more the lord has been mindful of us he will bless us he will bless the house of israel he will bless the house of aaron in case you haven't figured out my name's aaron that's what god did for me and i think is that luke 1 34 i believe believe the other scripture no is elizabeth in here she knows where this what the scripture is it's in luke 1. i was thinking it was 34 but her name was elizabeth and she's from the house of aaron because she asked the lord do you know who i am and where i live and he took her right to that scripture he's still the same yesterday today and forever okay there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abya and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth when she asked lord do you know like you did for dad and he took it right to that scripture he's the same yesterday today and forever because he's mindful of you because you're a part of him i'm going back to psalms 139 i think we're at verse 13. for thou has possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb and as i looked at that thou has possessed my reigns that's also our thoughts the word for reigns many times is our thoughts you you know what's going on in there and here's a testimony i'll share with you i have an older brother his name is alfredo lorenzo we call him fred and before he was born the lord showed my father what his son would look like and when he was born exactly of our brothers he's still able to do those things he's the same yesterday today and forever you know it's not another age it's not another time he's today and you're one of his he says you form my in inmost being you knit me together in my mother's womb you knew all about me david is saying i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well david had come to a place in his life a position is that where he realized this is god's work and each one of us should have that same testimony this is god's work in my life not our ability to figure out not our ability to put it all together not because we were raised on the church pew not because we were under this ministry or that ministry but because you're a child of god and he says my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth then i thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them now let me just read another translation your eyes saw my unformed substance in your books all my days were recorded even those which were purposed before they had come in to being and that's the thought that i wanted to get here you were part of him the back part brother bram says in the back part of his mind you were a seed you were a thought of god david writes it in the word of god now could he explain that did he understand or was that by inspiration but god allowed it to be written in the word of god so that you and i could see it and i could receive from it lord you've known my days you know my days and if you know my days from that are past which i would say looking past you also know my day of today and you also know my tomorrow there's nothing that i need to fear but god has it in there in control and he says how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them amen what does he think about his children you know um i i was telling abby one day because it's so fun being with the grandchildren it's just they were at the house friday evening they wore me out because they want to play with papa they want to run around they want to throw the ball they want to catch they want to you know and and finally i just had to tell them no papa's tired now you know but i told abby one day if i would have known that the grandkids were going to be this much fun i would have had them and not you and she looked at me like i understand father and i love you no she didn't not really but you're not just we're just laughing about it because it's different raising the grandchildren because we spoil them really well and then send them home right grandpas but you know it's a joy to watch our other the kids growing up and and watching because now i can i can watch them grow up differently than i watch my children grow because in the growing up of my children i was working i was doing this i was you know you were so involved in just trying to get them grown up trying to get them to the next stage of life trying to get them on because you're teaching now the grandchildren you can have fun while they're growing up you can watch them you can it's different it's like watching it all over again but maybe from a little distant view we get the opportunity to read the scriptures and see what god has done see how god acted see how he performed here see what he did there and say lord like you did there then i can receive the same when you know the story and you've read the back of the book and you know you win it takes the fear out of the story if you ever read a mystery and you're really into the mystery or if you're watching something if you're watching it on tv or something in the mystery and somebody came up and said boo to you man you jump out of your seat because you were so intense something especially if you hadn't seen didn't know the results you're going but we've read the back of the book and we win there is no fear in it but there should be a thankfulness and a praise and a worship to god because he knew me and yet he loved me he cared for me he said if i how precious are they thought are thy thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee think of that when i awake i am still with thee thou never does leave me you never you never walked away you were by my side when he said let's cross over to the other side do you think he didn't know the storm was coming do you think he didn't realize that they were going to be attacked saint was going to do all the good but he said i'm going to rest i'm going to lay down i'm going to rest he knew what was coming he knew he would speak peace be still over the situation it does it didn't faze him it didn't fear him now the disciples are having a wonderful time in this ship just just talking like when we hear a message or we've had a wonderful service or young people have gone to one of the youth camps and and we hear your conversation what a wonderful time god bless god did this everything so the disciples are having that kind of time in the ship brother branham calls it testimony in the sea as they're just oh wasn't it marvelous when he did what great when he did this not knowing what was coming up in a few minutes and then suddenly the wind begins to blow and the storm begins to there's a little bit of caps white caps and as it grows and it grows they begin to get a little nervous they just spent the last half an hour 45 minutes talking about the wonderful things that god had done the marv did you see when he did that did you see how that happened did you see what he said here remember how he said this and did you see hey did you catch it were you here well you know they were just like us talking about seeing the things that god has done and then they get into a situation and the next thing master save us do you not even care why are you laying down to sleep and we're about to get and he gets up and he's like my boys have you learned anything have you forgotten the little testimony service you just had of what i'm able to do did that already go right out because the present situation often has gotten tough again we learn by our experiences we grow by the things we experience with god you know as you learn in in work in your job whatever you do if i do this and and i do it like this it doesn't work it doesn't come out right but i've learned that if i do this and this you know by experience you begin to learn those things so here they are and he gets up gets the bottom head he didn't look around and the bible didn't record him looking around says oh my what's going on here what are we doing he just walked over the ball of ship and he said peace be still and there was peace and they marveled sometimes you stop and think about it i said lord they were just like us you know i just received the blessing of the lord and a situation comes up and i say lord where are you and he says what just happened didn't you just didn't i just say am i not the same did i change already david says if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with me with he said nothing changes though i go through this trouble though i am tempted and tried nothing changes you're still a child of god he still watches over you he still cares for you he still takes care of you and then david finishes on 23-24 he says search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there being any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting oh that that would be our heart every time lord search me look me over let's be sure that everything is right everything is how it should be always always lord a man after god's own heart a man i did say that right a man born of flesh with troubles and trials and heartaches and things a man after god's own heart that's what the scripture would say and it hasn't changed do we need to deal with the situation there okay all right there's the sirens and some people going out just making sure there was nothing there he's still god and you're still his children and he still cares for you job said it this way though god save me yet i will trust him i shall then come forth as go through all of that but but but brother aaron i'm human so am i and we have our days lord where are you and he comes draw and he reminds you that he cares if the musicians would come he reminds you what you mean to him and why he went through what he went through i wrote i love the way david wrote those pen that out because he shows his humanity but he also realizes what he means to god and what god means to him that he's the same yesterday today and forever let's bow our heads lord we've been redeemed bought with the price you gave your all from the day there you had set your face towards jerusalem because you knew what was about to take place in a what we would call in a space of time you had you had it created had made man on this earth in a garden of eden to to to help feel that need that desire you had for fellowship lord to walk with him to talk with them to spend the afternoons and the evenings with them and enjoying the fellowship lord but you also knew that there would be a fall it didn't catch you by surprise when you cried out adam adam where art thou you knew where adam was and you knew what happened you made provision for them because within you there was that desire to be a savior to be a healer to be a friend to be a comfort it was all part of you lord and it was going to be expressed lord jesus so you set your face towards calvary because that time had come when this was going to be fulfilled you went through such a crucifixion such a trial such a hard time you were bruised you were broken you were bloodied you were you were smitten you were they did everything to you lord and you took it lord because you wanted that fellowship back with your children you cried out at his finish you had already cried out my fault my god my god why hast thou forsaken me you understood the loneliness the feeling of despair so that you could be touched by the filling our feelings lord jesus and then you said i commend my spirit in your hands and you gave up but three days later you arose lord wouldn't it all seem hopeless we know the disciples were walking away they had turned their back and they thought it was over lord but the greatest victory had just taken place lord the restoration the redemption the fellowship that was coming back between you and your children lord we thank you for that today we appreciate it and we love you for it in jesus
