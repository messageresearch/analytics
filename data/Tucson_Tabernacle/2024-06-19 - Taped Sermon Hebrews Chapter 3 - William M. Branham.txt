Youth um they will uh they're just going to they're going to be doing it outside we're going to get some a couple hay bales to set around but but they were saying that hey we want everybody to stand up and I was thinking well I'm glad this is for the Youth because we need pews or chairs we need something to sit on and but it was it was such a blessing they were out singing and they were praising the Lord and lo and behold down walking down this road there's three young men in white shirts name tags I waved at them and I said come over and they were just kind of standing across the street watching they came over and they uh they were welcomed by our youth and they were just they they were really happy they the the one there there's they're all Elders I guess but the there was two Elder elders and they were like probably like 19 or 20 and then there was one that was like 17 and um they were uh they were they were just enjoying it and and they started talking with me and they started giving me testimonies about how the Lord had worked in their life and and I think that they appreciated it that I would listen and I cared and I saw the Lord working in these boys lives I want to share a testimony of this young man he he said that I said so tell me in your two years there two of them were about to finish their mission and um one of them was from Georgia one of them was from Texas believe and one of them was from Utah and they were here in Tucson on their mission and they do a two-year Mission and the young man told me I said I said tell me I want to hear what the Lord has done for you in these two years and the kind of the leader of the three he says well I have a I have a testimony I want to share he said that you know we go from house to house and and we pray for people and and um you we try to introduce them to and they talk a little different they have their own lingo that they use when they talk and he said one lady answered the door and she said uh she said yes and and he said well we're here from uh we're here Latter Day Saints and we want to talk to you about the Lord and and she says well she I can't right now she says I lost my teeth and uh he said uh okay and she says this is really bad she say I've been looking everywhere around the house I can't find them and the young man said can we pray and she says yeah that that would be good so they stand there in the doorway and they prayed and then the young man said she invited them in and he says um is that your trash can over there and she said she says yeah he said um why don't you go look in the trash can and she went over and she looked in the trash can and she had wrapped up her teeth in a paper towel and thrown them away and she found them and the young man the Lord just revealed to this young man where those teeth were what what a what a blessing you can see how the Lord he will use a sincere heart what uh what song was that you said Russell Kelo Carter yeah Standing on the Promises what what a what a testimony that brother Michael gave to us that he didn't care this man he was going to consecrate his life to the Lord Jesus he was dying of a disease whatever that disease was and he was going to consecrate to his life to the Lord live or die and that's the way we should be live or die Lord to me to live as Christ I'm going to live for Christ I'm going to do everything that I can for him when I'm here and to die is gain it's gain for me when I die but when I am here I'm I'm going to live for Christ and I appreciated those young men I don't agree with the Mormon theology I I I don't agree with the um the history um that they have portrayed but I do agree with the souls that are in the Mormon church and I pray that they find a living Jesus Christ the same Christ that I know and and I do appreciate young men like that serving the lord and doing their best in in these ages that age where there's lots of bars and and nightclubs and everything that they can be doing and they're living their lives they're doing their best so I appreciate them they will be here on on Saturday night for our our um our singing and uh that starts at 7:30 brothers and sisters get your kids to go get your grandkids to go get your friends to go if if you're a young person I believe that the Lord is in this and if he is in it then something's going to happen so please encourage others to come I think that we'll have plenty of plenty of people and uh we're expecting a good crowd and then on Sunday morning a friend brother Ryan long he's bringing some of the youth down from Flagstaff they're going to be with us on Saturday night worshiping and then on Sunday morning brother Ryan will Minister for us I'm looking forward to that I love brother Ryan he's he's a good he's become a good friend um and I like his perspective on things he's one that he approaches the scripture um with an open mind and I believe the Lord can use a man like that and then on Sunday night I want to continue on with the worship that that uh our worship team is going to have on Saturday night I want to continue on that with Sunday even evening and let's just have a worship service here in inside the church with air conditioning and with with comfortable seating and uh and if you have a song it would be a good time to sing it with our worship team and um and just be a blessing so sister Jessica please sister hope and and S Sister Sarah YouTube but whoever would have a song it's just a blessing it's it's really a blessing to to get together and worship our lord Jesus um I think that's all I have with my notes um let's all stand sister uh Amelia she called me today and um God bless her little heart she is she is such a precious little lady um she uh she has that brace on her leg and it was uh it was she had a new one built and it didn't fit it was causing a lot of a lot of pain and the old one I I assume that there's something wrong with that so please remember Sister Amelia in prayer and she's also struggling with um with a cough and with this with either allergies or sickness and she wants to be delivered from that I know our sister Amilia she doesn't just believe in prayer she relies on prayer she needs it and I think that we owe it to our sister to pray for her and as as I mentioned this morning please also pray for our youth that um we will uh the Lord will be with us Lord will bless us this not only this Saturday but also this Sunday morning and Sunday evening our youth as I said in my WhatsApp broadcast this morning they live in a hard time a time that that we couldn't even imagined when we were their age and to see all the influences there was influences when we were kids but the influences now are exponentially more with the social media and constantly being connected and constantly being tuned in they've got a tough time they need our prayer but I firmly believe that this generation of young people is the greatest that has ever walked the earth I believe that because they have the greatest adversary the Bible says in Isaiah it says that when the enemy comes in like a flood and it has come in the enemy is here he's attacking us with everything that he's got and he's hitting our young people with with things that have never been on the face of the Earth and they're here and God has raising up a standard of Youth against them I'm proud of our kids and I know that they can make it through and they need our prayers I stand with them how many here stand with our youth amen I'm proud and they're doing it they're making a stand don't have any other prayer requests brothers and sisters if you have a request upon your heart make it known to the Lord with an uplifted hand our heavenly father Lord I read these requests out before the congregation Lord but I know that there was a greater than is here [Music] listening you have your ear tuned to us father and you heard these requests raised up before you father we pray that you would heal our sister Amelia father deliver her and help her Lord with the bracelets that she needs to get around I pray for her I pray for father for everyone that came out tonight Lord bless them may we have a special blessing and I I pray for our youth this week father may may they be excited about about this gathering on Saturday night and may they come expecting and Lord we pray that you would be there waiting for them to touch their hearts and and give them courage father strengthen their walk with you grant it Lord be with us tonight I pray father May our ears father be tuned to the Holy Spirit as we hear this sermon tonight father speak to us we pray in Jesus name amen for tonight we started brother Stanley on a on a series on on the Hebrews the book of Hebrews and I thought it would be good if we devoted one night week to hearing what brother brandham said about this book tonight we will be listening to the sermon that he preached on uh September the 1st 1957 he preached it it was a Sunday morning preached in Jeffersonville the title Hebrews chapter 3 tonight we'll begin with paragraph 116 is when brother brandham starts into the teaching on the Hebrews and then we'll go all the way through the end both sides Brother s brother Stanley both sides of my family my mom her sisters my grandpa wheeler was a deacon at this time they were there in this service my dad the Evans family and his Grand his dad and his brothers and his sisters they were all there there they were witnessing this sermon and I'm glad that I have the opportunity as a grandson and a son to hear the same message that they heard some 60 70 years ago let's sing only believe only be [Music] only believe all things are possible only believe only [Music] be only [Music] be all things are [Music] Possible only again paragraph 116 God bless you you can take your seats now notice now we're going to start from the 15th chapter 15th verse of the third chapter closely now while it is said today if you hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation I watch watch Paul speaking here I said today after so long a time we're going to get into it after while that today so long a time comes into the next chapter after so long a time it is said today if you hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the day of provocation when they provoke God now let's read the next verse for some when they had heard did provoke now what's he talking about gospel how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom he was grieved for 40 years was it not with them that is sin whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and stop here a minute the provocation when they provoke now what did God do now Paul's trying to speak what is it led them out of Egypt was it Moses No Moses was the flesh instrument now we' got a background here we want to get straightened out now when we hit this spot down here in a few minutes you you'll see it now God had his people with unsettled rest they were down in Egypt they were out of the right position they were out of their homelands they were strangers and pilgrims and God was going to bring them from that housed in place in in Egypt up to the Homeland a type of today we're unsettled here it don't take long little chubby handed boys playing Marvels little girls with the dollies playing the first thing you know you got gray hair and wrinkled it up there's something wrong here this is not home we're in the wrong place that's why we say we are pilgrims and strangers Something's Happened a little lady said this morning in the room about how people laugh at her sometime I said but sister dear you're not out them people we are a different people my little girl said uh daddy certain certain girls did certain certain things that they did I said but look honey they had these records of Elvis Presley I said I wouldn't want them in my house she said but Daddy there ni little girls I said they may be I have nothing to say against that but there's one thing we are different we are different not is that we want to be different but the spirit that's within us has come out of that you're of another world when I go into Africa I can't get adjusted to their their their ways of living they don't wear any clothes they're naked and they pick up something that's rotten got magot they eat it anyhow don't make any difference see I this is different you know one time we were all like that but civilization has brought us to made us different and conversion has doubled that by millions we don't want the rotten things of the world no more Christ has made us become Christians amen like Civilization has made us become clean and notice not only that but we profess that we're pilgrims and strangers we're not all the world then you want nothing to do with the world and those things has passed away now Israel was down in Egypt they wasn't Egyptians Egyptians it was a disgrace for an Egyptian to put his hands on a sheep and Israel were sheep herders and how must it got Moses after all the Dignity of being an Egyptian cattle raisers did you notice what the Pharaoh had said to Joseph and so forth it is an abom Nation said your people are sheep herders and even Egyptian couldn't even put his hands on a sheep herder he was a different people and that's what it is with a Christian today when he's born again it's not it's filthy for him to sociate where people are drinking and telling dirty jokes and women naked and every it's it's fness oh bless be the Lord we are pilgrims here we're strangers here the spirit has been converted and we're looking for a city where women don't wear shorts we're looking for a city where they don't have fear taverns we're looking for a city where IND dwelleth righteousness so we're pilgrims so God came down in a big bundle of fire as of Halo swept down into a bush and begin to reveal himself to Moses first Moses said you know how we had the lesson the other night how that when Jesus was here on Earth he said well before Moses was I am that was Jesus in the burning bush in the pillar of fire it's Jesus today the same and he revealed himself in a pillar of Fire and Moses got the experience he goes down into Egypt he preaches the gospel the good news and signs and wonders follow him you get it same thing today not only that but when them Hebrews come out walked in the light they was led by the same Pillar of Fire and the Bible said that do not tempt God watch this let me read it while it is said today if you hear his voice Harden not your heart his voice speaking to your heart as in the provocation when they provoked him listen for some when they had heard did provoke how many knows that the Israelites provoke god with their unbelief amen they murmured they completely God walked right down there when he got out first thing they got in trouble here was this pillar fire above them I don't know where they all saw it or not at least Moses saw it and it was above them and they watched it and when they come down say it they didn't see it I don't know whether they did or not it went before him the Bible said it was there it said the star went before the wise man nobody saw it but the wise man it went over every Observatory they kept time to the Stars no one saw it but the wise man it was far them to see it and the wise man was who the star was sent for amen and the pillar of fire was sent to to Moses and Moses was sent to the children of Israel amen and they're supposed to follow Moses they could see Moses and Moses Saw The Light there they went they were leading and as they went out they come to the Red Sea all the seen all those signs of Miracles and things taking place while they were still down in the in the old land of Egypt but when they got out there in their Journey just converted and brought out then the first thing you know they got in trouble God loves to bring you in trouble he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it so he just stopped up the Red Sea and the first thing old Mar him right out into this place then sent Pharaoh after him see how God likes to do it he loves to display his power and love he's God and he just loves to show you who he is amen and the trouble of it is today people say all them days is passed no how can God display himself when you're taught such stuff as that but God loves to manifest himself here come the children of Israel walking in the light Moses going on before them there us come on this is the way God's calling we're going out we're going to the promised land oh Hallelujah there they all was shouting and jumping and having a good time you know and the first thing you know they looked back and said oh what's that dust one of them climbed up on the hill said oh alas alas it's pharaoh Army God said what you so scared about didn't you believe what I did down there what's you so worried about why you make me angry when he got down there Moses cl interceded to God God just opened up the red seene he walked AC cross closed the enemy in that's way God does it don't get scared don't get all excited don't be frustrated you provoke God then what do look like well we had one big Tri bless God we got we won't have no more we're on a road to the promised land and he let him run out into the desert where there's no water could you imagine god with his with his Sanctified holy people led them run out in this trap then got them out of that trap and let them run out here where there's no water when he could have tuck him somewhere where there was water what he could just made a river all the way WR if he wanted to he could have broke Every Mountain into Joy spitting water 50 ft in the air if he wanted to sure he could but if he done that it' been too easy oh BL be the name of the Lord why did God let this happen brother B why did God God's doing that let him alone just walk on that's God's business the footprints of the righteous are ordered by the Lord amen yes sir what difference does make lost all my money brother bless God anyhow oh did this this Happ the storm BL my away my house bless God anyhow the Lord Give the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord let's keep walking on it's all the glory of God God knows what he's doing some to the water some to the flood some through deep trials but all through the blood that's way he leads him that's right oh I feel like I can just stop and scream that's what he leads his dear children oh can you just feel now I'm not a psychologist but can you just feel that lovely Spirit now bathing over the build what if our eyes would come open this now look what's standing around the sides of these walls look down these eyes old Elisha one morning when that boy was just as blind as he could be he said look at the serious down there said is more with us said I don't see nobody said Lord open that boy's eyes he looked around that old Prophet all around that mountains was on fire and Horses of fire and Chariots of Fire he was convinced then he said we just gotten Smite and blind they had their sight this as perfect as they ever did but this blind to him said you all seeking Elijah said I said come on I sure where he's at that was him leading them they didn't know it that's way it is today Christ is here the Holy Ghost is doing the same things that he's always done and the world is blind to it they don't know it oh I don't know about that my pastor oh poor decrepit people see what I mean they're blind to it they don't know it God's the leading now they come up to the Wilderness of sin there was no water there God just had it all provided oh and they found a puddle of water they said this is it and they couldn't even taste it oh it was terrible my is worse than 100% sulur see just like rotten a you know oh my is ter it was poison Now call the Wilderness of sin several palm trees drove there in the spring where those palms grow then Moses said don't God said why what why are they provoking me Father well if I did that back there can't I do something about this situation if he got you out of one six spell can he get you out of another one he got you out of one trouble can he get you out of another one bless God if he got me out of sin he can take me out of the Grave he's God difference does it make just go keep your eyes on him that if I close the Red Sea behind and Dr them Egyptians can't I do something about this water what do you make me angry about oh your unbelief you provoke me to anger because of unbelief now the word here is you sin provoked made reason they did it they disbelieved they never went out and got the shooting craps now and things like that they never run around with somebody else's wife and went out and told lies that wasn't what they were doing but that's not sin to begin with living in adultery is not sin smoking chewing drinking gambling cursing swearing so forth that's not sin that's the attributes of unbelief you do that because you're an unbeliever if you are a Believer you don't do that that's the reason she said he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life not says he believes but really believes there it is that takes all your initial evidence away see there you are not he that Hearth my words that shouts not he that Hearth my words that speaks with tongues not he Hearth my words that has blood in his hand or in his face or whatever more that's not it he that Hearth my words and believeth on him and S me has eternal life and shall never come to the Judgment but pass him death to life what he see unbelief a little something can raise up instead of going right to the scripture and find out where it's true or not oh he said you go ahead I'm just continue a presbyterian like I am see go ahead blind and you provoke God when God does anything he expects the nation to grab it but instead of that you oh well I don't know about that see he expects the people to get it if you're concerned us sit down with the scripture go through it and search it back and forth and see if it happen if it's predicted to come to pass and so forth then you'll get it amen now notice while it is today if you hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation when God was provoked with him you see for some when they had heard heard the gospel Moses preached did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses how many knows how many people saved out of that original bunch and come out how many two is right how many those are names that's right Caleb and Joshua the only two out of two million something listen to this but he 17th verse now but with whom he was griefed 40 years because of unbelief was it not with them that had sinned disbelieved take the dictionary and find out what sin means take the Bible dictionary it's unbelief unbelief is sin he that believeth not is condemned already St John 4 condemned already whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should should not enter into his rest you're disbelieving oh how I never get to my chapter but look that's what's the matter with this nation today signs and wonders has crossed through this nation what did they do continually turned her back on and he said I'll swear that I'll not let them enter into the land they started to what's the matter if these big churches today their unbelief has provoked God hallelujah he able of these Stones toise children of Abraham he tried to give the gospel to them and they hardened their hearts they caught themselves and they made little denominations and we believe this and nothing else and God couldn't move in where they at today sitting on a sideline God's Little faithful group is moving right along with signs and wonders he's putting them to the test every son that cometh to God must first be tried and tested dial train first little thing happened oh well maybe doesn't do it anyhow you're illegitimate child and not a child of God for a child of God is a Seed of Abraham who calls those things that were not as though they were God said so and just keeps moving on Amen no matter what says there anything different they keep moving on anyhow God said so 25 years he waited for that baby no matter how contrary it was and he separated himself from them unbelievers am amen so he could believe oh my I feel religious think of it you've got to separate yourself from that dogma of the world ah them days of Miracles just pass there's no such a thing as that that's fanaticism separate yourself the Bible said come out from among them and be ye separated sayth the Lord and I will receive you how wonderful I will receive you after you separate yourself you shall be my children I'll be your God separate yourself don't yoke yourself up with unbelievers that's right young man getting married marry some girl that don't believe or some young girl marri a boy that don't believe you do that I don't care how cute he is and how cute she is and what those big eyes she's got they'll all fade out one of these days but brother your soul will live forever you be careful what you're doing she ain't a real believer him or real believer don't you yoke yourself up like that stay away from such it'll cause you trouble down the road now listen 1th verse but whom he was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had Sinn whose carcasses fell in the wilderness to whom he swear that they should not enter into the rest they started out but they seen the Miracles but they never did get to the promised land just a selected number of two enter the promised land now what's Paul doing he's speaking to the Christians now don't you let this same gospel that was preached back on Earth in signs and wonders and the pillar of fire let him when these things go to taken place again don't you fall over the Wayside but un Bel to go to dton for their carcass fell in the wilderness now we're coming in quickly now watch close but to them that live not so we see that they should not enter in because of unbelief he callus it sin once CS it unbelief the next time unbelief is sin they entered not because of their unbelief they seen that Prophet Moses they seen what he done seen what he said it was truth every time moved out on the truth this Pillar of Fire would appear before him they watched it they seen it Paul trying to get they later on get down here the experience that he had see trying to relate this experience en tighten it to the Old Testament he said now we've entered into a new thing to this new dispensation by Jesus Christ old times the Lord appeared to him by the prophets but now he's by his son Jesus see and he will begin to type the experiences and showing what was taking place how the signs and wonders and everything what's WR now I said they entered not because of their unbelief they did not believe but now we remove into a dispensation and don't you harden your heart don't you act like they did in the days of provocation when they provoke God how they do it not believe in him morally let me grind this down to you you say brother brand I go to church that's all right I never lied in my life that's fine I never stole I never done this that or the other that's very fine that's all good but that still isn't sin the sin is when God shows himself and you disbelieve it you won't listen to it oh you say my church don't teach that as long as the Bible teaches it and God proves it that's the thing now watch just a moment now we're going to start now on something real real deep now put your conscience in your vest pocket till you get outside now watch real close let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us to enter into his his her personal pronouns now what any of you should seem to come short of it now Paul's trying to tell them in the previous chapter about all these things but now he's trying to tell them what it is oh have we got time I maybe we better wait till tonight it's getting late we go to have a prayer service maybe we better catch it tonight because this is really full of vitamins spiritual vitamins got a lot to do in busy this afternoon let us let us therefore fear less a promise now do they have a promise to the promised land down in Egypt and when God came down to make this promise a reality why God told Abraham hundreds and hundreds of years before that he's going to do it it was scriptural Joseph said don't you move my bones from here until you go to that promised land and bury me up there the rest of my fathers because you know the resurrection was coming when Jesus rose from the dead because he know what job said see each one of them prophets though just what the other Prophet had said and know that their Spirit was the same and they was watching oh brother Bo that hard shake us out of our word condition they had their eyes I know what people are saying but what them Prophet said each one of them was watching Abraham said bear me right here where job was bearing said Sarah I'm going to buy a piece of ground we're going to be buried right here Isaac was a prophet after his daddy said listen don't you bury me anywhere else not down here in Egypt but you take me right back in the promised land you bury me right here Jacob died down a Promised Land but said to his son who was a prophet said you one night the angel touched me on the side and I've Lim every sin come put your hand oh mercy my Prophet son I'm old and I'm blind but put your holy hand in a prophet yourself lay it on the place where the angel had his hand and swear to the god of Heaven that you'll not bear me down here bless do you see the spiritual revelation of the word well half of to 90% didn't know what he's talking about but he knew what he was talking about put your Prophet hands on this place where the angel laid his hand I was once a big Stout man a robust coward but he touched me and since then I've been a liing man but I've been a prince ever since I lied ever since I changed my way of walking I've been a prince hallu yes but your hand your wherever the god of Heaven you not bury me here why no one know what he was talking about Joseph did he said take me up and bury me in that Promise Land there's where was that certainly when Joseph died years later he said don't you bury me down here but you look at my bones when you pass by CU someday you're going out of here and when you go take my bones with you there you are let the world say what they want to and do what they want do blessed be the name of the Lord Keep Me In Christ if I'm called anything uh fanatic or holy ruler someday he's coming and those that are in Christ will God bring with him when he comes it's all a spiritual revealed truth laying right there and it takes a spiritual mind to catch it rest on that through the day think of it even if you do without your dinner think of it and tonight we'll go into his rest that was left and see what this promise is today what is this thing today if God has got here the Bible and prove it it's right here now then I'm a false prophet that's exactly right but it's here what is this rest he said now let us Fearless a promise being left us to enter in just like they did and it's got to be the same promise it's got to be the same rest it's got to be the same God it's got to be the same signs it's got to be the same same thing let us stress out what is it may the Lord grant it to us tonight while we bow our heads blessed Lord only eternity will reveal the great things that we now share together little as many who are ordained to condemnation as thou has said in the book of Jude that man of old for our dained to condemnation would take the grace of our God and turn it into lasciviousness and many they are preaching the gospel the grace of God turn it into a money-making scheme having a great big church for the most in Sunday school taking the grace of God and turn it into lishness and the world's blind going like blind pigs they don't understand oh God open to us understanding let our understanding not be like the children of this world for thou has said in thy word that the children of this world are wiser than the children of the light in the beginning it was so the children of Cain become great Master scientists they become great Educators they become workers of material they went on progressing very religious but was condemned and drowned in the judgment and their carcasses floated on their water and their souls went to hell and Jesus went and spoke to him when he died and went to hell and preached to the souls that was in prison that repented not in the Longs suffering of the days of Noah sayith the scripture and God as he stood on Earth he said as it was in the days of Noah so would it be in the coming of the son of man man but we notice the lineage then of Seth humble man real man of God not knowing too much of the things of the world caring nothing for the things of the world but have laid aside every weight and to believe God and become prophets and great man in the Kingdom while the others the other religious World laughed at him made fun of them but the hour come when the floods and judgment came so wasn't the coming of Jesus Christ how they laughed and made fun of him while they had their own religions in their great churches but they made fun of the morning star and they laughed at him but yet they entered into judgment and when they flee and went into the Jerusalem there they eat their own children from starvation and their blood run out the street Gates when they burnt the city in the temple and their souls went into hell Lord here we are again on the 3D this is a lifetime three is the number of life here we are ready for the Rapture the church moving on the great scientist world the church is today sitting full of skeptic Believers tens of thousands with their names on the book yes millions and would laugh at the gospel and say that they're uneducated they don't know maybe that's so Lord but what we La in education you make up in Grace but sending your angel of Light by manifesting his power confirming the words to those who are poor and illiterate as we but we love you for this because it's the grace of God that has did it and we know that we were born and we're not lovely at all we're very unlovely but thou through Grace reached down thy merciful hand and it's opened our eyes as Jesus prayed for us as Elijah did for Gaza as he looked to see around him and today our eyes are open and we see the things of God and know we're moving at the end time when the Gentile people's days are about finished and he'll take up people for his name let us be included there Lord humbly we beg we pray that you'll Grant it bless this bless this little audience this morning they're made up of all different types of religions and beliefs but lay them aside today God and may they look straight towards Calvary say God mold me and make me I'm like the the prophet said that he went out to The Potter's House that he might be broke up and remolded mold us and make us after the passion that God would have us no matter if we had to be the floor matat at the house of the Lord I'd rather be the doormat than to dwell in tense with the wicked in Grant it Lord just bless us now and keep us humble let our hearts be open our minds clear to the things of God for we ask it in Christ's name with our heads bowed I wonder if someone would want to be remembered in a word of prayer for your salvation of your soul would you raise your hand to this is sinner God bless you young fell someone else God bless you back there sir God bless you lady someone else like to be remembered in prayer just now for your soul God bless you Sarah with your hand up and God bless you and you here wonderful would there be another just before closing I feel it be God bless you back there sir in the back say now look I want to ask you something I don't want you to think it all because it's this little Tabernacle I don't want you to think it's because it's this people and merciful god don't think it's because that the angel of the Lord had his picture take with me and I and and St of that to do that oh God if I felt that way then brother I need to be the altar instead of asking you but I'm only saying this I'm only saying this by the scripture that you'll see that this is the truth if I said it and that's all there was to it went on like any other preacher or something other or any other well then it would be different but you see the thing God comes right back around and proves it it's the truth see that's what makes it real is God proving it and then not only that but his word says that he'll do it here he is doing it now if you're not in the right your heart's not right with God would you just just raise your hand say pray for me all right right where you are about eight or 10 hands has been up wanting Mercy for their soul while you have your heads bowed now you pray remember you're the one to repent I'm only asking for you that God will be merciful but that's the altar God has brought you to a place in your mind that's the altar we believe in coming to the altar sure but that doesn't that doesn't it it's all right but your real alar is where God's met you and he's met you right where you're sitting that's your altar now I say God be merciful me a sinner and from this day on if you'll help me I'll live for you I I'll serve you I don't care what anyone say I'm stepping out this morning I'm praying right here and you take this old sassy spirit away from me you take this temper away from me I know I can't act like that and be right with God and I got hatred in my heart I'm jealous I got malice I got this that ticket without God I don't want to be like that make me sweet and humble and meat make me gentle make me such a person I can win others to you let me do something for you to show appreciations of my life that's the prayer you pray now while we pray together Heavenly Father they're yours they're the fruits of the message this morning they raised their hands something made them do that they def they defied the laws of gravitation when they raised their hands there was a spirit in them that made a decision they raised up their hands that they accept the Creator who made them now heavenly father I pray that you'll bless them and give to them eternal life right now there's nothing I could do call them around the altar putting them in the next tree room doing all the work it takes you to do it Lord we can't do no more than preach the word you said Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word the word of God now we've preached the word and they've raised their hands that they believed it now give them everlasting life because you promised You' do it if they were sincere and raising
