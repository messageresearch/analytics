mighty thing we went to the doctor great doctor's new hospital and they said well this is just the way it is this is she's got a baby inside her and it's pushing on the nerve and and you'll hopefully feel better once the baby comes i said you know good luck and and we know you know in the scripture it says that child bearing is difficult and painful and and that's the way it is but the lord had mercy on us the lord heard your prayers and and and she just took a change a turn for the better where medical didn't give us any hope but god's so good to us and you don't appreciate what you have until until it's gone and you know you see uh it's made me realize how much lydia does for us for our family and just thankful to the lord for a good wife and and for all that she does and lord raising her up to be able to help her family so lord is good to us do you have a praise a specific praise that you have on your heart you know we always ask for prayer requests but you have a praise

people of like precious faith we just asked lord that you would accept our worship as we sing praises to you lord maybe may it be a sweet sound in your ear lord jesus we want to ask you to forgive us where we've fallen short we don't want anything standing between us and your ears as we lift up our prayers to you lord these requests that were made mention a couple of second body lord jesus we just you're the the physician the great physician you've designed our bodies and you know every ailment you know just exactly what is required to bring us back to perfectly whole lord and so we just lift up these few requests to you if there was an unspoken request you know the details of that lord you're more than able to pull that request into your perfect will lord above everything we ask for the lives the souls of those that that don't know you yet lord and i believe that you're holding time in your hand as a an answer to the bride around the world who continue to pray for their loved ones and i believe that lord i believe that that's why we're still here is you're it's it's an answer to your bride's prayer and and may we never want to leave so bad that we would want to leave someone behind lord jesus we ask all these things in your name and we commit this service to your perfect will in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i claim the blood key of f i claim the blood jesus shed

sister sharon fought near here oh and their children too praise the lord they even brought the children so thank the lord for that i i suppose i have as i heard after the service some repenting to do to that poor little girl who had to hold her arms out for so long this morning i don't even know if she's here tonight she may be at home resting but i i i'm so sorry to that little girl for making her stand there for so long like that brother matthew mcfadden expressed that that's what they used to do to punish the soldiers i guess in the military and i certainly was not intending for that to be the situation lord knows my heart but if that little girl is here uh this evening i would ask is she not here okay well um i'll send some candy i'll have some candy for you to set aside for her uh i and for those those two other children they're not here is either that helped well i have some candy set aside for them as well i really do have some candy for them ah just good to talk about the things of the lord so nice when you can see it i know sometimes the visual um helps with the young people but i'll admit even some of us older ones it helps us as well and and so i hope that that was something that would would help you in in in being anchored and grounded and i want to thank the church here uh for putting myself and my family up at the hotel while we've been down here we're so thankful for you all those are those are your tithes and your offerings and we appreciate that that you're supporting my family and and we want to say thank you for that and for the lunch today um you

brother enoch in the back i was watching him when the singers needed help with the microphones he was here and you know that sometimes gets overlooked and i'm i want each of the musicians to know sister baggett and and those that uh that are willing to give their their gift that god has given them to the lord i'm thankful for that and i know that the children of god are thankful that the for the gifts that god has given you and for you to use those the way you do so i want to say thank you for that if you have your bibles while i have you standing i'm sorry to keep you standing for so long you want to turn with me in the book of revelation chapter four i mentioned this is where we would be going this evening want to turn in uh revelations chapter four we're going to just read verses six through eight and i suppose again um i do like to leave uh congregations with a little bit of homework so that you don't feel like you've left been left out you have something to offer as well that would be to go home and listen to um to the message of the hour specifically revelations chapter 4 and if you want to revelations chapter 4 number 3 the third tape on revelations chapter 4. this is where i've drawn all of my notes and and i um and so i would encourage you to go and listen to that tape i believe it'll be a blessing to you uh let's start at verse six before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within that margin there says around and within if you'll run that margin there there they were full of eyes around and within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come amen let's just bow our heads one more time precious heavenly father lord we thank you lord for this resurrection day lord for us to come and to honor you lord a risen savior a god that is alive and working lord full of power and full of grace full of love lord full of all those fruits of the spirit and lord we're thankful for everything lord that you have provided for your church lord we would ask that now you would come again lord that you would allow us to do as they did when you were walking the shores of galilee let us sit at your feet and learn of you lord that is our desire something lord that would sustain us lord would be enough lord to give us strength and encouragement lord to press the battle in whatever capacity that would be man woman boy or girl lord we want to commit this service to you lord we ask that you would have the preeminence we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you can be seated i'd like to read this from by faith moses preached in 1958 before we begin there is no way to ever please god only by faith the scripture plainly states it that way and it's by faith and without faith says the scripture it is impossible to please god so if faith disagrees with science and science disagrees with faith that puts them at edge at each other then we must take a choice as moses did by faith we believe now if we lose faith then we will never get a prayer answered by god for he that cometh to god must first believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him so if we lose faith our prayers are annulled we get nowhere so it's all that we can think of this morning is to hold on to faith then if we lose faith all our hopes is gone and if we lose faith all our spiritual reality is gone for you cannot have faith in things that you see for the things that you see are all perishable if we look at some great person a great minister or a great congregation they will all perish someday and if we look at a great nation or a great weapon they'll all perish someday and then we must live by faith of those things that science does not declare it's by faith that we believe now we lose our glory if we lose faith now if we get away from faith then we take the church into an intellectual realm and many times it's been thought amongst people that because a congregation was large and they had great churches great steeples and a great lot of well-dressed and groomed people and a lot of finances that they could afford such things we many times thought that was inspiring that this certain church must be inspired or we've often referred to different ministers who get out on the field and have great gatherings of crowds and we think sometimes that they are the signs of inspiration but that's not altogether the truth that's human inspiration but the real inspiration comes by doing the will of god see whether it is one or just a handful whether it is a big church or a small church it matters not whether he is a great eloquent speaker or just a man that hardly knows his abcs it doesn't matter it depends on the message that he's bringing whether it is inspired by the word of god or is it inspired by intellectual conceptions of human inspiration some people can be inspired because of an eloquent speaker that doesn't make it right sometimes they're inspired because the man is so trained that he could put his point over that doesn't mean that it's of god see it's only through god's everlasting eternal blessed word can we receive inspiration and that's given by the holy ghost by faith we receive it i wanted to read that to you right off the bat this morning and i i got ahead of myself and i apologize for that so i thought i'd read that to you this evening because i think that our minds and our hearts when we come to a service should should be with the intention of our faith in god to do something for us not i want to hear something new i want to hear something inspiring but i want to see god as those greeks that approached the disciples they came to him those disciples and they said you know we would see jesus that's how we feel as believers when we come to the house of god we want to see jesus when we talk amongst one another as believers we want to see jesus when we're sick or we have a loved one who has a great need whether that's a sickness even unto death it's at those moments we would really see jesus we'd really like to see jesus moving and church i was going to say we're not exempt from trials but that's an understatement we're the ones who are especially keenly aware of the trials and tribulations that are placed upon a son or daughter of god the great news is we are we have an understanding why those trials are happening what they're meant to do for us without that understanding that's why men and women turn to the bottle that's why they turn to the pills that's why they they they go they try to gather up as much money so they can try to find comfort and vacations or whatever it is because they don't understand why the hard times i like the good times why the hard times but we understand that those are the that's the fire that brings out the pure gold and so we're willing to it during the heat of the trial and believe me i know about the heat of the trial but during the heat of the trial when when you feel like you are you're in a war zone that's the time we have a place of refuge a place that even while things are loud and noisy and chaotic we can go before our father and say lord i'm trusting in you that whether you bring me over this under this around this or through this it's you doing it and lord not my will but thy will be done in my life this morning we were speaking about the day of atonement and we were we had given a good i don't know how good we gave an illustration about the tabernacle in the wilderness and we showed uh the altar of fire for sacrifice we showed the brazen altar uh for the the laver for washing the sacrifice we the waters of separation we showed the candle sticks within the the holy place the shoe bread the table of shoe bread the altar of ins for incense then we showed in the holiest of holies the mercy seat and the ark that carried the tablets of the laws of god the manna and the rod of aaron we talked about that mercy seat how that the high priest on the day of atonement and the importance of the day of atonement and the the sprinkling of the blood seven times representing the blood of jesus christ through the seven church ages we showed those things we were specifically talking about that mercy seton without blood it's a judgment seat but with blood it's a mercy seat and that's what we're thankful for that the blood of jesus is still on the mercy seat of our heart now that's where it is and we showed that not only the act of jesus doing the propitiation but him actually being the place of propitiation and him being the one who's who is that mercy seat who sits on your heart tonight if i had a title and i i want you to know i preached this message i want to say at least 15 years ago brother david may have even heard this sermon um years ago i preached this and it i i don't have the notes from that sermon so this could be totally different but i kept the same title and that title is homeland security and tonight i want to talk about homeland security and i'll show you why i took this from the department of homeland security's website and it says our duties are wide-ranging and our goal is clear keeping america safe and so that's the they i believe it was george w bush who started homeland the homeland security in 2003 i believe and because of the events that took place in 2001 the terrorist attack at the trade towers this homeland security became a very popular title around the u.s we all if i would have asked you know in the early 2000s uh you know about homeland security i think we probably would all say oh yes very much i know what homeland security is and they're still active it's still an active department today in the government um but it i just i thought that that was just a nice synopsis our goal is clear keeping america safe so i think that that's a good idea in the natural when you when we're talking about homeland security we understand it amongst our nation here what homeland security is is to do it's to protect america and the american citizens uh to protect us from from well i would say definitely foreign attacks but perhaps even domestic as well i don't want to get into the government because i it's not something i'm interested in but i want to talk about homeland security tonight because i believe that god as in the spiritual realm also has a homeland security and when we look here and i said it this morning when john is is told to to to write the things that he sees when he's caught up on the lord's day there on the isle of patmos and he writes the book of revelation over a period of two years through a series of visions that god gives him in a trans in in in god translating him to the the day of the lord as brother branham puts it uh john begins to write the things that he sees and as i said this morning we we we heard brother branham say that john and ezekiel saw the same thing they what what john is seeing with that ark uh or what ezekiel saw with that ark and the wheels and it moving uh with the wheel and the wheel with the hub and and the ark and the being the word of god moving here on earth john sees it in its resting place in heaven but it's the same thing and you'll see these recurring uh creatures and and these recurring themes you'll see it recurring through the scripture and it's i believe that it is just a testament of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's it's an assurance that god i am the lord thy god i change not and sometimes we just need to be reminded of that we see the children of israel needed that reminder constantly time and time again god would they they that children of israel had heard to hear the word of god they would turn towards god say god we want to serve you god would give them a direction they would go that way for a while and then after a while they'd begin to drift away and god would send a prophet on the scene and a prophet would come along and and say heed the word of god listen thus say it to lord you're you're wandering you're straying church you're the children of god and you've gone after the strange gods and get back to the word of god get back get rid of those idols get rid of of of these things that you've drifted away from and get back to serving god and they would put ashes upon their head and they would tear their clothes and they would repent to god and say what have we done they were constantly needing a reminder and we are no different we need a reminder and and and that's why i'm so thankful we have this glorious message of this hour on recording because when you begin to get anxious when you begin to work get worked up or riled i'll tell you i'll give you uh something that that that helps me put on a tape and just listen to a prayer line just just listen to god speaking through that prophet and saying your name is so and so you come from this place you're not here for you you're here for a loved one and they've got this disease and if you'll just believe thus saith the lord go home find them well or you've got this this tumor and and it's gone is that right and and you hear these things and you go oh god that's my god that's my god so tonight when we look at that mercy seat there's something that was specifically that was placed on that mercy seat that if you go and you'll read exodus chapter 25 i'll give you these scripture references and and and i encourage you go and and read these scriptures moses when he's given the pattern of the tabernacle and then he's given the pattern of each of the pieces of furniture to be placed within the tabernacle one of the things is that that mercy seat that's to be made of gold but on top of that was to be molded to cherubims those two cherubims are what we're reading about right here in revelations chapter four they're living creatures now in your english in your old uh king king james version it says it calls them uh living for beasts but if you'll go and again you'll you'll run your margins and you'll look at your hebrew and greek lexicons brother branham points out that this word beast in the i want to say the hebrew is zun z-o-o-n which means living creature whereas the beast that you read about in revelations chapter 11 and 13 and 17 this is therion which is an untamed beast so there's a difference and you should know that and i i say that for the sake of maybe our young people don't take one word and then just splash it across your whole bible there they mean different things in different places you need to understand context it's very important and so these beasts are living creatures now john here describes these beasts and these living creatures and he says that the the first was like a lion the second was like um uh the face of a man oh excuse me the first a lion the second a calf the third the face of a man and the fourth was a flying eagle and if you'll go and you'll you'll read uh in exodus it says the same thing now those two cherubims had those four faces each of them had uh those four faces ezekiel you'll find the same thing you want to go and read ezekiel chapter one you'll see the same thing four living creatures with these different faces same faces a lion an ox a man and an eagle now i want to try to hurry through this so bear with me this is from revelations chapter four number three let's not leave that for a minute let's just hold it there a minute living creatures what are they if they're not angels they're not redeemed men what are they would you like to know here's my interpretation i hope it's right i believe it is they are god's guards of his throne now we're going to erase this just in a little bit now you see there they're not angels nor man they're not wild beasts they're creatures living creatures now brother brahma says the interpretation i hope it's right i believe it is they are god's guards of his throne now it's a again it's nice imagery when you imagine the ark you imagine the mercy seat you imagine these cherubs and their wings and their faces and we we realize that that mercy seat or judgment seat depending on if there's blood or if there's not blood is now represented over here in revelation as a throne before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and so again this sea of glass we we understand the brazen altar to clean and we understand this throne or this mercy seat by where the presence of god abides jumping down here to yes perfect and these cherubims first mentioned was placed at the east gate of the garden going four ways now i want to read that for you i could just give you that scripture but i'd like to read it for you would that be all right in revelation excuse me genesis chapter uh chapter 3 and verse 24 so he drove out the man let me start at verse 22 so we can understand who the he is and and the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims cherubums plural and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life now they turned every way and if you'll go and you'll read in ezekiel ezekiel sees them and he says everywhere they turned they went straight forward because one was one face was facing east one was facing west one was facing south one was facing north and so no matter which way they turned there was a face to go that direction they were they were able to go straight forward because they faced north south east and west in all directions and these cherubims now going back to the message here first mentioned was placed at the east gate of the garden going four ways i should have made that a little different from that i can i can't do justly to god now brother rams drawing here i can't do justly to god's orders and things like that but i just so that you'll know what i mean there's the garden of eden and this is the gate right here opens up here swings out and at this gate there was cherubims cherubims and remember it doesn't say a cherubim it said cherubims cherubums was placed there to guard what the tree of life that's what they was to guard the way of the tree of life the way who is the way jesus jesus says i am the way the truth and the life where is it reflected from here is the holy place here are the cherubims now watch put all this down now while he's saying this you have to imagine like we did this morning you have to imagine this this old testament tabernacle where is it reflected from here is the holy place here are the cherubims now watch put all this down here is the holy this holiest of holies holy of holies this is the holy place and here is the sea so he's saying holiest of holies holy place the sea we understand that and here is the sea and here is the light candles the seven that's reflect the light from here in here in here in here in here in here so he's showing those seven candles see what are they reflect they are guarding and reflecting with the fire of god the way to the tree of life these golden cherubims are reflecting and guarding the way to the tree of life now you can see it if you're imagining the old testament tabernacle in the wilderness but but then you can see it when you begin to think of a garden and you think of of this garden of eden and this gate and you can see these four cherubims two cherubims four cherubims guarding the way of the tree of life with flaming swords all right now hold on guarding and reflecting with the fire of god the way to the tree of life see it can't come from over here presbyterian seminary or a pentecostal seminary it's got to come from here reflecting the light all right you notice these cherubims that john saw here must have been interested in keeping the tree of life so they must be interested in human beings or read genesis getting back to genesis again they kept the tree of life guarded it the way of life the way of life how is the way jesus said i am that way i am that bread come down from god out of heaven if a man eats this bread he'll live forever now there is a way back to that tree of life you get it oh my oh there is a way back to that tree of life jesus said i am that way oh thank god it wasn't just an open thing of you fell at the garden now they've got cherubims with flaming swords no more way to the tree of life no he says there is a way jesus said i am that way. oh my now at this i want to show now and make this sure it's i love this it's an altar now this must have been an altar at the garden of eden i'll tell you why do you remember both cain and abel came up here to worship so that shows that god's altar was moved and set here at the garden of eden and the only way back to eden is by the altar here you are again see back to eden through the altar and they were to keep that way there guard it they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood oh god can't people see it see nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat there this altar of judgment must become a mercy seat and when this altar if the blood's lifted there will stand on that judgment day the fire of god's wrath to guard that tree again oh church i promise you if you go and listen to this tape you'll be so blessed i i was simply having to pull pieces out because we would just be here all night ah it's so good it talks about how that john there at the beginning of chapter 4 he's saying when he saw this throne oh here i'm in genesis i'm going that doesn't make sense john says ah there was a throne in heaven i meant chapter four and verse two and on one sat the throne and he that sat was to look as jasper a sardine stone there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices brother said that's judgment that shows the bride has been is gone the bride's been she's been raptured at this point and now thunderings and lightnings is judgment it's speaking of judgment now oh my it's tremendous because it it it helps you to see the order and the process of the way god is moving things we're not over here and then over here and then over here and then over here no through that after the seven church ages once that bride is lifted there's it's not a mercy seat anymore there's judgment taking place and when this altar if the blood is lifted there will stand on that judgment day the fire of god's wrath to guard that tree again only one thing will enter into this gate to eden again will be through the blood of jesus christ you see it and i i just i put a note here speaking of those cherubims guarding the way of the tree of life with flaming swords and and and i i put this note of ephesians chapter six and verse 17 it starts off take the the helmet of salvation it says and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and so we see that if you would look at this in a type that those four creatures guarding the way of the tree of life guarding the throne of god guarding the altar they were guarding with the sword of the spirit of god which is the word of god and i didn't i didn't uh put this into my notes but later in the message brother brandon says i want to show you something he says notice those cherubims at the garden of eden were keeping keeping adam and eve and cain and abel keeping them out from keeping them from the the tree of life he says but now these creatures are driving us back toward that tree of life now they're not trying to keep anybody from it they're pointing us to the tree of life oh my we're so blessed god so good to me i love that how that song was just sung like that we are so blessed now notice now they guard the mercy seat when god is in his shekinah glory where where was the cut the shekinah glory at the mercy seat is that right they guard that shekinah glory hmm listen friends then it goes to show that every scallywag can't come there and take of that you've got to be prepared before you come into the presence of it you begin to think about that high priest and again you go and you read in exodus chapter 24 and 25 and 26 and god is giving very specific instructions not only how to build the tabernacle but also the furniture that's to go into that tabernacle and how the high priests and the priests are to dress themselves they're to come in a very specific type of clothing they're to come and and not just offer for the congregation they've got to come and offer for themselves as well and when they walk they've got pomegranates and bells on their dress and when they walk it's to make a noise that sounds holy holy holy before god holy and if and if if they just came in any old way dressed in any old thing without the blood they could die and that example is given in this in this message brother branham says remember aaron's sons or eli's sons came in with strange fire and they tried to light those candles with strange fire strange fire was a fire that was not lit from god was not lit from that altar it was their own lighting it was some other type of lighting but if they came in there and they did they tried it and they died and it's and it's easy to think of the priest the priest but you are have become that priest you have become that now i would say if i could back up a little bit before you were that priest this is why when i was reading in hebrews when paul is expressing to the believer that christ jesus christ has come after the order of melchizedek the high priest he came after that order not after the aaronic priest that had to be through its certain lineage jesus was even born of the tribe of judah not not the tribe of levi but paul's saying he's a high priest not after the levitical order but after a higher order than that he came after the order of melchizedek who was without father without mother with no no days no beginning of days and no ending of life this is jesus christ and when you can get that you could say my jesus christ the supreme deity of god lies within jesus christ and then you realize that the promise that the life that was in jesus christ has been promised to them who would be who would repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins you shall also receive this life now that sounds bold but peter on the day of pentecost had the keys and the question was what are you going to do with that key you know what that key means peter do you have a real revelation of what you're talking about if he didn't then he presumptuously said what he said on the day of pentecost i don't believe peter just presumptuously said it because the gifts and manifestations of god followed what he said 3 000 and then five thousand were added and then it just kept going that very life that high priest and now you have become kings and priests now they guard the mercy seat when god is in his shekinah glory where was the shekinah glory at the mercy seat is that right they guard that shekinah glory hmm listen friends then it goes to show that every scallywag can't come there and take of that you've got to be prepared before you come into the presence of it now it's it it's in in between here where brother branham is using that scripture in ephesians ephesians that we read this morning that we've been washed by the water of the word that you've got to be washed by that water first that's the waters of separation it separates you the the the word of god is what cleans your life and even makes you how can i say gives you the desire g gives you a gives you a clear clean approach even in your mind to come to god and say god would you receive my offering i want to give to you this living sacrifice which is our reasonable service is to present ourselves a living sacrifice to him now he goes into this speaking of judah and i i didn't back up enough here but he says now he was the lion of the tribe of judah now anybody that's ever read the bible know what dan's number was or what that what dan oh i mean what yeah what dan was he was a eagle that's right he was an eagle somebody's been reading the bible he was an eagle let me just stop here for a moment just so i can explain this at the tabernacle in the wilderness you had the 12 tribes of israel and each of those tribes had banners representing representing their tribe that we belong to the tribe of dan we belong to the tribe of judah we belong to the tribe of ruben we belong to this tribe and what they had was banners with a symbol that represented their tribe now you can read this in your bible when they camped around that tabernacle in the wilderness they camped three tribes on every side north south east and west and the and with in those three tribes one of those tribes was to be a representative for the three tribes and they would hold their banner now the the symbol banner for the tribe of judah was a lion the tribe of judah the lion of the tribe of judah the symbol to represent dan was an eagle and that's what random is talking about right here is these banner representations of these tribes as they camped around all the way around four sides around the tabernacle i hope that you're understanding these four camping around guarding around the throne of god now the reuben i'm continuing on now the reuben was the man he was the first one the weakest one of the bunch didn't jacob say so in genesis 49 reuben thou art the first of my strength but like water you went up on my couch and defiled my couch and lived with his father's concubine see that's the immorals of the human being you see the animal don't have them immorals the lion none of these has that but the man does run with the next man's wife and so forth just like just the same thing everything's completed now this down here this dan was an eagle this reuben was the man's face and ephraim is the ox now you get the picture there ephraim there's the way they camped in the bible so now you see that there was four representations around even that tabernacle in the wilderness a banner of the lion a banner of the ox a banner of the man and a banner of the eagle you see the same thing this same pattern then not only do you see it on that camp around the camp but now you go inside into the holiest of holies and you've got two cherubims on the mercy seat and those cherubims have got the face of a lion an ox a man and an eagle then you look back at the garden of eden when the man is put out of the garden you see these same cherubims guarding the tree of life now we're living in another age glory oh i love this age don't you now god has a mercy seat today to be guarded you believe that where's the mercy seat found in the heart of man where did it come in the heart of man at the day of pentecost when the holy ghost which is god come into the human heart is that right oh my so now we're seeing what moses saw when he's writing about genus in genesis about the garden these cherubims then we see moses shown this pattern again in the old testament for that for the pattern of the tabernacle we see it again then ezekiel sees the same thing again the word of god uh the ark moving on a cart and everywhere it went it went straight forward and it was lifted up then we see john showing it again in its resting place in heaven but today it's still here that mercy seat is still here on earth in the hearts of men and women well if the mercy seat is here and if that altar at the garden of eden had guards protecting it and if the mercy seat here at the in the old testament tabernacle in the wilderness had guards protecting it and we see over in glory over in that throne god is resting in that john is seeing when judgment comes and we see these four creatures what about today is there still a guard for the word of god now let's read on now remember god has got some guards for that for that mercy seat what is that mercy seat they guard all right matthew on the east luke mark and john all of their four gospels vindicate the book of acts to come they guard it anywhere you want to look at it oh my now that was paragraph 326 the next is that quote that i have comes in paragraph 340 but in between there brother branham begins to show how that god down through the gospels that those four gospels were the framework to protect to guard what was going to come to manifest in the book of acts that when jesus was walking the shores of galilee when he's teaching his disciples when he's living his life the the very life of god is in flesh and he's demonstrating the will of god in a man so when we now can look back retrospectively and say what would what would be an example who's the example i want to pattern my life after after we would all say jesus christ jesus christ is the perfect pattern we we we liked the pattern of moses but moses lost his temper struck the rock we liked the pattern of of of uh let's say jacob but jacob lied we liked the pattern of abraham but abraham lied as well we liked the pattern of these men but they had imperfections but when we look at the life of christ it's a perfect pattern of what god desired in men and women and we say god that's what i want to be and so when we fall short we say oh i feel so dirty i feel so dirty but that's what he lets us know but that's why i gave jesus christ that's when i came in in flesh was to to to be that propitiation for you we say thank you lord and he says it's it's over we as we talked about this morning i don't even remember it i see you righteous i see it a finished work it's a finished work you're perfect you're perfect you go oh lord give me that vision give me that revelation but he goes and he says what is it that they're guarding and he and he talks about uh the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost and how that uh when you read in the books of matthew mark luke and john that these gospels are are when you read the words of jesus christ saying i will i i will not leave you comfortless but i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world i'll send you a comforter and that comforter won't only be with you he'll be in you you'll be a teacher what is it it's a promise of the holy ghost to come a promise that there is an infilling that there is an indwelling of god for a man and a woman he goes on and he says what about divine healing and he reads uh i think mark uh mark 16 and and these signs shall follow them that belief and he's showing that these these gospels guard those precious promises of god for the believer so you're it's not just a i hope well that was good for so and so but what about me no those guards are there to let you know it's for you and the proof of it is the book of acts you notice it's not jesus christ himself doing these anymore you see these acts of the holy ghost in the apostles now you see uh men like peter and john going by the gay beautiful and a man who's crippled it's this isn't where's you know or is this jesus that you talk about and they said look look on us not that they had that healing virtue but they said silver and gold i don't have but such as i do have i give unto you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and there was demonstrated right there the life of god in an in in a man and woman or those were both men there but but it was to whosoever will so we say praise god the baptism of the holy ghost is for me praise god divine healing is for me praise god these pentecostal blessings are for me and he takes you through matthew mark luke and john showing you that those words of god that those gospels were written they were given as guards to protect to guard the book of acts to show you that this book of acts wasn't a fluke it wasn't a a once-over thing and then it was it was done but this was promises to you to your children and to them as far off even as many as the lord our god shall call oh my now this is where i say i'm closing and you all know what that means it could be another hour but i hope not did you think that god don't put a guard around his word see if that ox lion man eagle isn't still setting at those gates right here on earth right now here's the gospels the four gospels see and you notice everywhere they went they went straight forward they don't contradict one another oh my amen praise the lord for that they stay with one another oh thank you lord see one goes with the shrewdness of a man the other one goes with the swiftness of an eagle the other one's a pastor one's evangelist to fly like evangelist see the other one's pastor the one other one's sturdy the other one's shrewd see guarded on every side god guarding this holy ghost gospel believe it brother all right i think that's just so beautifully put if you catch what he's saying there is that look god hath set in the church some apostles some prophets some pastors teachers and evangelists that's god has done that god has called men put calls in their life to be that now you say yeah well i've seen a lot of us a lot of men that think they are and i we had we we i didn't understand that you say there sure is a lot of counterfeit money out there i know that but that means that there's got to be a real somewhere there's got to be a real and it's said that god has done that that's what we as believers we say god i'm resting in that i'm trusting that you will put in the church a pastor that you will put you will give the evangelists to some you'll give you'll give an apostle missionaries to others you'll give teachers to some for the for the for the building of the body of christ you know what each body has need of we're trusting in you god to bring that and oh look how he does it it's so beautiful sometimes sometimes we need the swiftness of an evangelist to come in with the fire of god to shake us up to say children of god get on your knees repent before god clean your lives up say my that evangelist he sure is so fiery why is he preached like that then you got the teacher and he says let's walk through this let's take a look at this closer let's pull this scripture apart word by word and see the meaning of this you say oh my thank god for the teacher who helps us to be grooted and grounded in the word of god so we have a clear understanding of what it means then you've got the pastor and he's a ox he's a burden bearer he's a man who can bear the burdens who can who can take the weight of you know pastor we need to have a talk and two hour counseling session and you know i got to tell you about my troubles and i got a real problem with this brother and this sister over here and then you got that same brother and sister over there that say pastor we need to talk i got a real problem with this brother and this and that man is able to be to bear the burden as brother branham say not take sides but to hear both of them out and to bring them into the truth i thank god for these things god has protected this word god down through time has protected this he hasn't left us without guards we're not without a homeland security believers we don't have to look at the governments and say oh what is this world coming to oh what is going to happen to the us we're pilgrims and strangers here we're seeking a city to come who's builder and maker is god where we need to look where's our security where's our protection where's the guards that will guard my children that will guard my daughters from the predators of this world that will guard my daughters from the fashions that try to suck them into the world system where is the protection for our sons to become men of god to become real husbands to become real fathers where's our protection as believers it's in the word of god god's got it in here and if if if you can if you can get into your bible you can read these things and not read it as a history book but say you know that it's good for me i believe that not only will you start now listen and this is where i believe that brother billy graham did such a fantastic job at getting people to understand that do you understand who that god sent his son jesus to die for you and the world says we see it you you preached it such a nice way and then brother branham would would even uh acknowledge and say and i'm so thankful for a man like oral roberts with bulldog faith who could say if you can just believe you can have what you ask for put your hand even upon your radios this is true and god used those men and i'm so thankful for that but church i i i'm not belittling that and saying but to that i'm just saying this we have been given a word to let us know that when god came in the days of sodom and gomorrah and i believe we're living in a day just like that that when he came and was calling for people to come out of that come out of that he also met with abraham and his people and we've been given a a a a word that is more than than just uh a joseph speaking to his brethren we've been given a honeymoon type of talk that look i enjoy the fellowship in the kitchen it was real good around the food and a nice talk and i enjoyed going into the living room and kicking my feet up and maybe getting to know you a little bit more but to say no this i've got personal secrets personal things i've got a letter about predestination for you i say yeah but i mean it's right there in the bible predestination that's for everybody oh but not everybody can accept it not all will receive the truth of before the foundation of the world the lamb being slain and you being predestinated and your name on a lamb's book of life that cannot be blotted out not all will receive that but for those that can receive that those they can go on and they can say the baptism of the holy ghost is receiving the life of jesus christ and the evidence knoweth it's not speaking in tongues it's not shouting it's being able to receive the word of god and believe it and say amen to every word of it and not just say it with their lips say like no i'm not saying just say the word amen but their life says amen to that so so be it well but you know but you're sick i mean you're sick i know but god said by his stripes i'm healed and i'm gonna walk like that you mean you actually are going to walk even though you're you're hobbling you're still going to believe that god finished the healing for you i do i do i just believe it i believe it i believe he'll what he started he will finish that sounds like divine healing you know isn't that what those old-time pentecostals believe yeah i guess that's what those old-time pentecostals believe i guess i'm an old-time pentecostal well i believe that if if god saved me and god filled my heart he can keep me clean not just from one revival to the next i believe that tomorrow come monday morning i can i don't have to worry about falling off the wagon i believe god if god brought me here he'll keep me here and he'll keep me clean and and i guess i believe in sanctification well man isn't that what those old-time methodists believed yeah i guess i'm an old-time methodist oh what why do you want what do you want you want a title bro brandon said i'm a i'm a baptist nazarene pentecostal is that what you wanna you wanna pin that one i'll take it later in the book of revelation we see these creatures again in the opening of the seals we see this lion this ox this man and this flying eagle and with the revelation of the seven seals we see that it dovetails perfectly with the seven church ages and we see how that in those first four seals those anointings both both anointings this the anointing of the spirit of christ and the anointing of the spirit of antichrist both riding through those ages through history from the day of pentecost until the rapture takes place we see those spirits and they're intertwined brother talks about them being intertwined those spirits we can see it in the framework of the church the so-called church system we see it we see god pleading to the church to the churches come out come out don't be partakers come out of that and we see the spirit of antichrist who who's who's bringing in uh false doctrine false teachings uh love of money greed trying to to to to to rob the relationship between a a man and god we see that through those seals and as we see those horse riders we see satan trying to extinguish the light of god through those horse that horse rider on those four horses and we see that god had servants with the spirit of god and the anointing of those four guards and god protected his word and i said it like that for a purpose god protected his word so many times we want god to protect our feelings for god to protect our intentions but i read for you at the beginning of the service how that we brother branham says we we sometimes look at ministers and if they can bring their thought across so eloquently we think that had to be inspiration of god well it could have been but it might not have been or we think well you know that church is packed to the gills there's got to be god moving there well maybe maybe not god put those guards around his word those guards are guarding the way of the tree of life they're guarding the law the word of god they're guarding the manna the hidden manna they're guarding they're guarding those things and for the believer if the word of god lies within your heart the spirit of god which is the word of god if that dwells within your heart you don't have to worry about keeping it he's got guards to guard that word say but my feelings yeah well our feelings have led us astray time at times but my intentions brother branham said the road to hell is paved with good intentions but his word heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away if that word lies in your heart if that word is what you're lining your life up with and when i say that word so many times we get this image of the bible the bible you know the bible and it's true this this is the thoughts of god become words put on here but it's even the the the spirit of god the holy spirit of god that spoke that word when that is what dwells in your heart he's not leaving that unprotected for some man to come manhandle in your life he's got guards and if per chance some men would try to come and bring strange fire into their god has got something that you can go back to and say that's real fire that's god lit fire and not only do we have it here but when you go and put those tapes on and you say my that's nothing but the truth that lines up with the bible and that's what we've discovered we've discovered a message that lines up perfectly with this word that the life represented the same life it did the same thing that the that those apostles did when they received this precious word it did the same thing that those prophets did when they were walking this earth or any other believer who stayed true to god's word to god's plan to god's moving those that stayed true to that god had a word to protect that to bring them back to to say that's thus saith the lord that's thus saith the lord that is thus saith the lord and when when jesus was here as brother branham said he didn't have to say thus saith the lord he said but i say unto you because he was the lord today we've been pointed back to that with thus saith the lord that what jesus said is the same yesterday today and will be forever not only was it protected in the garden not only was it protected in the days of moses in the days of ezekiel in the days of jesus christ and in this day but we can see we can look forward and we can see that same word will also as we read this morning will also be the same word that washes the tribulation saints who have a testimony of moses that said lord your word was true and the messengers that you sent down through those ages their word was true and those people that believed you before before the tribulation hit those people believed you that this word was true and it is true and we're a witness that it's true we don't follow fables and cunning devices of men oh my it's the word of god it's the pure word of god and it will bring you through and it's it's a homeland security for you you say i found it i found my homeland it's this it's not just the word of god it's god himself and you can have so much security you can feel so secured in god the brother branham said it like this if god sent me to hell i'd still love him you got that kind of an experience yeah what i found in the word of god and what i've seen in the children of god is enough for me to say this is true i believe it and god i love you i love you lord i love your word god i love your moving i love i love when you come and you can speak to me in a song i love when you can speak to me in a conversation with a brother or sister over the phone over the kitchen counter god you're so real you're so true i love it when you can speak to me in the hospital i love it when you can speak to me god when i'm on my knees with my bills on the bed and the tears dropping from my eyes god when you can come and you can when you can give me comfort that the money doesn't give me that the medicine doesn't give me i love you god and lord i'm so secured by this word that lord whatever you would have for me whatever wherever you would send me i love you now that's some security right there that's eternal security we believe in eternal security of the soul not to disgrace but we believe in that as believers the eternal security amen let's stand together i just want to close in a word of prayer and our musicians could play softly with our heads bowed before god just looking to the dust from where we came from i would just [Music] i would just ask you in this time of turmoil in our country and in the world even this pandemic and it's a very real thing i don't make any light of it it's got this world shook and if if you're [Music] if you're looking to the news even if you have a direct line into [Music] the white house or some some great official building and you had direct contact with the leaders of our countries things like a virus [Music] things like unrest in a man's heart prejudice or hatred toward another country fear perhaps of what they could do to us i can assure you you will not find rest in a diplomat you can't a diplomat can't take a virus away from you we've been so privileged to understand [Music] unseen realms demonic realms and how that demons are involved in sickness lord knows that we've been privileged we've we've been given insight into these things to understand these things that the world is they're shook about [Music] and they just even though we may live in a first world country we say we're in the great u.s of a we've got the greatest military might but you know maybe we're starting to question that with maybe china or russia well we're not so sure where we're at as far as militarily or maybe even with what's going on within the decisions made within our own country and it begins to bring unrest in your heart begins to maybe even scratch at the fear and you start to wonder who is guarding us who will protect us [Music] it makes you wonder if not only am i not protected maybe i might even be sold into bondage and given over freely to harm's way you can only find unrest in those things and only find fear but church when we look into the word of god this is what we want to be concerned about it's the things of god what where are we what pertains to us as believers we're not just looking at the possible 90 years or so that we might live here we're looking beyond that we're looking from the very beginning of time down through all these ages through all these nations and governments that have and we can look down through time and we've been given [Music] we've been given insight through men of god who had the ability to look beyond the curtain of time to to see things pertaining not only to the past or the present but also the future [Music] church i i want you to feel protected i want you to know that god has got a guard around his word that will bring such security to you and such security to your heart and to your mind that even if your body falls apart if you're if if your economic life begins to deteriorate there is a sure rest in the word of god and if we can strengthen that if that could be strong in our heart then it won't matter so much what we come up against because we'll know how to overcome [Music] and i want to give you comfort i want to exhort you the bible it tells us to exhort one another it says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is but exhort one another [Music] and the more so even as we see the day approaching that exhorting one another is encouraging one another and i want to encourage you church god has given us a word that is so alive today it's so true it's so working that it didn't stop at the garden it didn't stop at that gate didn't stop with moses it didn't stop with ezekiel it's still moving on [Music] and you can take security in it that it has stood the test of time that it has stood trials it has stood governments it has withstood all of the all of the things that the world could throw at it the word of god still stands sure and we need to encourage one another in the word of god when a situation comes up that looks so dire that looks so helpless not to immediately jump to a conclusion where it's the end this is the end and this is where we draw the worst of conclusions but that's when we need to draw strength from the word of god that's where we need to look inside and we need to say lord jesus if you did it once you'll do it again that god if you help my situation you can help my brother's situation you can help my sister's situation lord you can help this one who who doesn't know you yet god if if you'll just meet them their lives will be transformed and everything will be all right [Music] we want to encourage one another so lord we come before you tonight lord we recognize this pattern in your word lord we see that you continually reminding us of lord your presence of your word of your promises god the ability to keep us clean god the ability lord to provide for our needs lord it's sure and we're certain that god if you could do it for your children in times past you can do it for us lord i believe that for tucson tabernacle tonight god i believe it lord these people are gathered here not just to come to church but lord they've come to hear from you they've come to see you god they're gathering believing that they're still believers in this community who want to gather around the word of god the good things of god and lord you know that that desire that is in their heart to gather around things like that god you see that desire that god you see you you've

right ahead of me when that lady stopped us and she said are you pentecostals that's what she asked and brother reggie stopped and he said yeah the original ones and that caught her totally off guard
