[7:57] little bit of rest
[8:00] right it's not a it's not a rest from
[8:03] from fighting where we got to go back to
[8:05] fighting it's a rest it's a true rest
[8:09] and I I really believe that when you
[8:11] when you find your place in the Lord you
[8:15] find a place of rest it doesn't mean
[8:17] it's not hard right it doesn't mean it's
[8:19] not a battle but I rest in his ability
[8:22] to win that battle amen and that's
[8:23] there's but I believe this song's
[8:25] talking about a rest that I don't know
[8:26] if we've experienced yet we were talking
[8:28] about that brother that maybe going on
[8:30] he's about to experience some real rest
[8:33] real rest got to lay down the weapons
[8:35] don't have to pick them up no more I
[8:37] look forward to that but we're here and
[8:40] we got a battle how many's how many
[8:42] still fighting how many is tired of
[8:45] fighting I'll raise my hand but we got
[8:47] the Lord on our side amen and right when
[8:50] I right when I fail right when I drop
[8:52] the sword he picks it up amen he picks
[8:55] it up he picks me up and he carries me
[8:56] forward it's not a it's not a cliche
[8:58] it's not a metaphor for it's not a nice
[9:00] thing it's the truth yes it's what the
[9:03] Lord does for us he goes ahead and
[9:05] fights our battle for us we just need to
[9:07] we just need a claim it this morning
[9:08] amen I just appreciate the the song
[9:11] service appreciate the worship and I
[9:13] can't sing but I certainly like singing
[9:16] with the musicians here we appreciate
[9:19] them we appreciate brother Dan as always
[9:22] for just his friendship and his um his
[9:26] kindness and his invitation to to stand
[9:29] behind the pulpit that is um he has
[9:32] responsibility over and we don't take
[9:34] that lightly we always want to fall into
[9:37] the channel That the the pastor is in
[9:40] the spirit that the pastor is in so that
[9:43] it's a blessing to the people amen you
[9:44] don't want to come in and say something
[9:46] that that would go against anything but
[9:49] we want to just say what God has to say
[9:50] amen and so I just always want to uh to
[9:54] look at it that way and to to Really
[9:56] Just Surrender I pray that you would
[9:57] surrender too yourself to the Lord this
[10:00] morning um you know it doesn't do much
[10:02] good for a speaker to surrender if the
[10:05] ears aren't surrendered to wow you know
[10:08] a a speaker could be surrendered and and
[10:10] and Words of Life could flow forth not
[10:12] from me but from the Lord and if your
[10:13] ears aren't surrendered and your hearts
[10:15] are not surrendered um it'll be like
[10:17] seed that just fell on Stony
[10:19] ground and I know we get hard and I know
[10:22] we get thorny right but let's just let's
[10:24] just uh let's do a little plowing this
[10:25] morning even if it's right now in your
[10:27] mind just say Lord I came here with with
[10:29] uh with an argument I came here maybe I
[10:32] got in a little uh you know nobody been
[10:34] married has ever been in argument before
[10:35] maybe you gotten a little uh uh fight on
[10:37] the way to church or maybe you just have
[10:39] a battle going on maybe you just pray to
[10:40] the Lord right now Lord just set that
[10:42] aside I want to hear from you this
[10:43] morning and and I I trust that he will
[10:46] help you do that how many is looking
[10:48] forward to hearing from the Lord this
[10:50] morning amen that's the only thing
[10:52] that's going to do us any good my word's
[10:53] going to fail brother Dan I could say
[10:55] this I know what you you know what I
[10:56] mean your word's going to fail it's
[10:58] going to fail but we we we have the
[11:01] reason why you gather here this morning
[11:02] is because we have a word that does not
[11:04] fail and that's the one we want to hear
[11:06] this morning let's let's read a
[11:07] scripture I kept you standing um a
[11:10] scripture I think it's really familiar
[11:11] but um I'm going to read it anyways if
[11:14] if you would Ephesians 4 11 um a lot of
[11:17] what we believe is based upon the
[11:19] scripture I've heard it quoted uh my
[11:22] whole life and uh I'm not going to bring
[11:24] anything new to it but I'd like the Lord
[11:27] maybe just to open up uh an standing if
[11:29] we could this morning Ephesians
[11:33] 41 when you have it say
[11:38] Amen should be familiar to us he says
[11:41] and he gave some Apostles and some
[11:44] prophets and some evangelists and some
[11:46] pastors and teachers now just something
[11:49] to point out if he's telling in the
[11:51] scripture that he gave some these things
[11:53] he must be talking to those that He gave
[11:55] it to he's not talking to the apostles
[11:58] he's not speaking to these prophets and
[11:59] these evangelists he's telling you the
[12:02] Church of God that he's given you these
[12:04] things for the perfecting of the Saints
[12:06] for the working of the ministry you know
[12:09] if you want to be in the ministry it's
[12:10] not an easy path it's
[12:12] work the work of the ministry and for
[12:15] the edifying of the body of Christ that
[12:17] word edifying means uh maybe you know
[12:20] this but it means to
[12:21] build it means to actually construct and
[12:24] to build up so the ministry the fivefold
[12:27] ministry as we call it has been given to
[12:31] build or construct God a
[12:34] body for the perfecting of the Saints
[12:36] for the work of the ministry for the
[12:38] building the construction of the body of
[12:41] Christ dropping down to 16 For Whom the
[12:44] whole body fitly joined together and
[12:46] compacted by that which every joint
[12:49] supplieth according to the effectual
[12:51] working in the measure of every part
[12:53] maketh increase of the body unto same
[12:56] word the construction or the building of
[12:59] of itself in love dropping down to verse
[13:02] 29 he says let know now listen who is he
[13:05] talking
[13:07] to all
[13:08] right he gets a you get A+ A+ he's
[13:12] talking to you and he's talking to me he
[13:15] gave you and I a
[13:17] Ministry can we say Amen to that he gave
[13:20] you and I something that would help
[13:22] build us into a body that he would be
[13:24] pleased with and now he's going to give
[13:26] us more he says now you that I'm talking
[13:28] to he says let no corrupt communication
[13:32] proceed out of your
[13:34] mouth but that which is good to the use
[13:38] of same word building and
[13:42] constructing that it may Minister Grace
[13:45] unto the hearers amen let's just bow our
[13:48] heads Heavenly Father we just want to
[13:50] approach your word and your throne now
[13:52] Lord not not with any preconceived
[13:55] notion Lord not with any thoughts of our
[13:57] own we just want to open your word have
[13:59] you give us an understanding of it Lord
[14:01] may you just take these these words of a
[14:05] man Lord that are are are fallible and
[14:07] will fail Lord and may you strengthen
[14:09] and turn them into your word Lord may
[14:11] your spirit just come and speak to any
[14:13] Heart Lord that is wanting to hear from
[14:15] you this morning that's pulling that's
[14:17] in expectation Lord I believe that
[14:18] you've bound yourself Lord to meet that
[14:21] expectation and that's what we trust on
[14:23] this morning Lord we ask you just come
[14:25] and talk to us now Lord out of your
[14:26] Bible in Jesus name amen you may be
[14:29] seated uh might be a strange scripture
[14:32] to start with we all kind of know that
[14:33] scripture but uh I I I just like that
[14:37] thought of the of the ministry and
[14:40] really what the purpose of that Ministry
[14:41] was given for is to build a house and uh
[14:45] I'll get on that here in a minute I want
[14:46] to read another scripture it's okay I
[14:48] got I got a few scriptures to read if
[14:50] you don't mind uh I hope it's still okay
[14:52] that we turn in our Bibles and read some
[14:54] scriptures right that hasn't gotten too
[14:55] old uh 2 Corinthians 4:
[14:59] 8 um it's a a couple scriptures here
[15:02] I'll try to go fast um I don't want to
[15:04] take too much time this morning but I
[15:07] want to give all time to the Lord and
[15:09] also be considered of you all here I
[15:12] want set a
[15:16] uh uh set myself a little timer just so
[15:19] I have something to ignore when it goes
[15:20] off rather down so but I could I can say
[15:23] that I tried no I really want to to try
[15:25] to to try to be uh uh graceful with the
[15:28] time you've given me this morning
[15:29] Ephesians second I'm sorry 2 Corinthians
[15:32] 4:8 it says we are troubled it's still
[15:35] talking to us we are troubled on every
[15:39] side oh amen right I can say Amen to
[15:42] that one I feel troubled on every side
[15:44] sometimes yet we are not
[15:47] distressed we are
[15:50] perplexed but we are not in
[15:53] despair persecuted how many fell
[15:56] persecuted all right we got a couple
[15:58] pers persecuted but not
[16:02] forsaken we're cast down on but not
[16:06] destroyed yes sometimes we're cast down
[16:08] by Family sometimes we're cast down by
[16:11] work by our jobs by our own selves amen
[16:14] cast
[16:16] down but not
[16:18] destroyed always bearing about in the
[16:20] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[16:23] the life life also of Jesus might be
[16:26] made manifest in our body we're talking
[16:28] about a body being built a body being
[16:30] constructed and we want more than
[16:33] anything I believe that you're on the
[16:34] same page with me we want more than
[16:36] anything to see the life of the Lord
[16:39] Jesus being made manifest in that body
[16:41] there's no point in constructing a home
[16:44] anybody that's in construction there's
[16:45] no point in building a home and putting
[16:47] the nice furnishings and and finishes on
[16:50] it if nobody's going to live in that
[16:51] house right if it's just going to sit
[16:53] there empty what was the point of doing
[16:55] all that
[16:56] work for which for we which live are
[17:01] always delivered unto death for Jesus
[17:03] sake that the life also of Jesus might
[17:06] be made manifest in our mortal flesh I
[17:09] want to drop down to uh verse 17 it says
[17:13] for our light
[17:15] Affliction We Were cast down we're
[17:18] persecuted we're attacked on every side
[17:20] and yet the Bible says I know that you
[17:22] are but that's light
[17:25] Affliction for is but for a moment
[17:32] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[17:35] eternal weight of glory and I love this
[17:37] verse it says while we look not at the
[17:40] things which are
[17:41] seen But at the things which are not
[17:45] seen for the things which are seen are
[17:48] temporal but the things which are not
[17:51] seen are Eternal and the first verse of
[17:54] the next chapter flows right from that
[17:56] it says for we know if our Earth House
[17:59] of this Tabernacle were
[18:02] dissolved we have a building of God a
[18:05] house not made with
[18:07] hands Eternal in the
[18:11] heavens I'm going to read you something
[18:13] I I I I I know it's okay to read a quote
[18:15] I want to start off with this if you
[18:16] don't mind it says more and more I am
[18:19] made to believe that people are not
[18:22] getting to
[18:25] christow you say you start off on a
[18:27] negative well just just wait
[18:29] now I am here to help in every way that
[18:32] I can and make my statement as clear as
[18:34] I know how to make them and you suffer
[18:36] with me if you will as I look and I
[18:39] preach Across the Nation and watch the
[18:41] people I am fully
[18:44] persuaded the prophet of God says that
[18:46] the people are not getting to
[18:49] Christ and I believe that it's the enemy
[18:51] that's throwed this hindrance and the
[18:54] reason I believe this is because he
[18:57] talking about the Lord is not the object
[19:00] that they have been pointed
[19:03] to they have either been pointed to a
[19:07] Dogma or a
[19:09] Doctrine or a party or
[19:14] experience or a sensation or something
[19:17] like that instead of being pointed to
[19:20] Christ the
[19:23] word and I that's why I think that
[19:25] people are resting their Eternal
[19:27] destination upon some Dogma or some
[19:31] sensation like some say I danced in the
[19:33] spirit I spoke with tongues I felt fire
[19:35] run over me and you know that all those
[19:38] things can be impersonated by the devil
[19:41] wow now does it mean those things are
[19:42] wrong no no it doesn't mean they're
[19:44] wrong it means they are something that
[19:46] can be impersonated it doesn't mean that
[19:49] they're not there isn't a genuine out
[19:51] there I think that we're taught by the
[19:52] word that if you see a counterfeit
[19:55] dollar bill are you following me yeah if
[19:58] you see a counterfeit dollar bill that's
[20:00] the best sign that there's a real dollar
[20:02] bill out there right you can't make a
[20:04] counterfeit of something that doesn't
[20:06] exists or something that's not real the
[20:08] best sign that there is a real
[20:10] experience that there is real emotion
[20:12] with God is that there's an
[20:13] impersonation of that emotion but he's
[20:16] trying to get a point across to us that
[20:17] we are not to look at those
[20:21] things as evidence that we are doing the
[20:23] right
[20:25] thing they are a benefit they are a
[20:28] maybe the word is they are a
[20:30] bonus they are a thing that is good when
[20:33] the Lord allows it to happen but it does
[20:36] not mean the Lord is with you if they do
[20:38] happen I know that sounds a little bit
[20:40] backwards but that's exact sometimes
[20:42] we're taught if you're not doing these
[20:44] things you don't have the Lord if you're
[20:46] not dancing you know and I hear both
[20:48] sides of it if you're not dancing in the
[20:50] spirit well the Lord's not in your
[20:52] service and then I hear the other side
[20:53] but but also if you're not being still
[20:56] and listening to the Small Voice well
[20:57] then the Lord's not in your service and
[20:59] I think I I think we're looking at the
[21:01] wrong things sometimes and I really like
[21:03] to talk to you this morning if the Lord
[21:04] permit about a change in
[21:07] perspective a change in our point of
[21:10] view you know sometimes we just have the
[21:12] point of view I have the point of view
[21:13] that I'm attacked at all sides and I
[21:15] forget that I haven't been
[21:17] defeated I just look at the one
[21:19] perspective and I think okay I see that
[21:21] I'm being attacked but I failed to have
[21:23] the perspective that wait a minute I'm
[21:25] still standing wait a minute I haven't
[21:27] been defeated I fell down I got beat I'm
[21:29] on my knees but I'm still
[21:31] alive I I haven't been conquered yet why
[21:34] is that Lord but I'm just concentrating
[21:36] sometimes on the hard thing that's
[21:38] happening to me oh Lord I'm going
[21:39] through a trial and then another trial
[21:41] comes and another trial comes and
[21:43] another trial you know he allows every
[21:44] single one of those trials that not one
[21:46] thing if you're a child of God how many
[21:48] how many is a child of God I just want
[21:49] to make sure okay good that was that was
[21:52] like 99.9% that that's pretty good
[21:55] there's 100 I will say it's
[21:57] 100 that if you're a child of God that
[21:59] not one trial can come upon you that the
[22:02] Lord hasn't said yes I'm going I'm going
[22:04] to let that
[22:06] happen you can touch this but you can't
[22:08] touch this you can affect this part of
[22:11] that sister's life but you can't touch
[22:13] this part that brother who's going
[22:15] through this I'm going to let you let
[22:16] him go through that I'm goingon let you
[22:18] Satan uh have a shot at him but you
[22:20] can't take his life where do we find
[22:22] that we find that in job if you're going
[22:23] through and job just didn't go through
[22:25] one
[22:26] trial he went through it was uh One
[22:29] messenger comes in oh your all your
[22:32] children are dead another messenger
[22:34] comes in all your herds are dead another
[22:36] messenger comes in oh this and then all
[22:38] of a sudden he's sick and then his wife
[22:40] comes it's it was literally trial after
[22:42] trial after trial and sometimes I feel
[22:45] like I'm just in I'm I'm going well it's
[22:47] going good and then there's sometimes
[22:49] it's just like it's it's hit after hit
[22:51] after hit after hit but it's but it's a
[22:54] perspective that God is trying to get me
[22:56] to see he said there's one thing that he
[22:59] cannot impersonate and that's the word
[23:03] he says in a debate between him and
[23:05] Jesus each time Jesus defeated him he
[23:07] said it is written the word and I
[23:10] believe today that the reason people are
[23:13] not coming to Christ is because they are
[23:16] appointed to a denomination come on you
[23:19] say well wait a minute we we're
[23:20] appointed to a denomination we're not in
[23:22] the Lutheran Church we're not in the
[23:23] Catholic church if you're not being
[23:25] pointed to the one who's going to
[23:28] inhabit the house that is being built
[23:31] you're being pointed in the wrong
[23:33] direction I I I want to just say this
[23:35] and I hope you get what I mean but if
[23:36] you're being pointed to the ones who
[23:39] were who were building the house they're
[23:41] not the important
[23:42] ones if I could just say that again
[23:45] there is a Ministry given and the job of
[23:47] the ministry is to build a house anybody
[23:49] ever moved into a house that should be
[23:51] an easy one all right do you know who
[23:54] built it now maybe you built it but if
[23:56] you don't if you didn't build it do you
[23:58] know who who built it have you ever met
[24:00] them would you move into the house
[24:03] anyways yes because who built the house
[24:06] doesn't necessarily matter what matters
[24:08] is that you are moving into that house
[24:11] and I think sometimes so much focus is
[24:13] put on the ministry because they but
[24:16] they are actually just put there to help
[24:18] build a house what really matters what
[24:21] really we need to be poed to is who is
[24:23] going to come inside that house and
[24:25] inhabit it who is going to come and make
[24:27] that house a home is it going to be the
[24:29] spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ slain
[24:31] for us or is it going to be the spirit
[24:33] of the Builder who built the
[24:36] house I know that's I know maybe that's
[24:39] a confusing question but I think
[24:40] sometimes according to what I'm reading
[24:42] we're being pointed to the wrong thing
[24:45] we're being pointed to that person or or
[24:48] somebody who may have just been
[24:49] appointed by God to preach one message
[24:52] and that one message maybe just put on
[24:53] the trim around the side of the house
[24:55] that's all they were there for maybe
[24:57] this is a last message I'll ever preach
[24:59] and maybe it was just to like move some
[25:01] dirt up around the house and just smooth
[25:03] it out maybe that's the only purpose
[25:04] I've had but guess what God is using
[25:07] that and other Ministries to build a
[25:09] house what's really important is you
[25:12] because you're the house that is being
[25:13] built you're the house that's being
[25:15] built he cares about the house because
[25:18] that's what he's going to come and live
[25:19] in it's not that he doesn't care about
[25:21] the ministry he doesn't care about
[25:23] Apostles and Prophets of course but they
[25:25] are his workmen to really build the
[25:27] thing that he cares about which is you
[25:31] that's a point of view that God wants to
[25:33] get across to us that maybe you are
[25:35] focused on the one building you and not
[25:38] focused on the one who's going to come
[25:40] and live in
[25:41] you and it's important Ministry is
[25:43] important I'm not diminishing the
[25:45] ministry but really they're the servants
[25:49] that build the
[25:51] house you he say that many times they're
[25:53] pointed to a denomination you come to
[25:55] our church this is his in quotations you
[25:58] come to join our church or you read our
[26:01] catechism or you believe our
[26:04] Doctrine anybody ever hear that in the
[26:06] message yes sir yes they are pointed in
[26:10] the wrong way and their action and the
[26:13] life that they live without
[26:17] Christ proves in their own life is
[26:19] vindicating that very
[26:22] thing the ministry is given to help
[26:25] build the construction of the house
[26:28] that's
[26:30] it not to come and live in the house not
[26:33] to be the lord of the house not to rule
[26:36] over the house to help build the
[26:40] house how do they do that by looking
[26:42] into the word by the way we should be I
[26:46] can I can say this because I'm also a
[26:49] sheep I'm not a pastor I I could say
[26:51] this as a sheep I need to be looking
[26:53] into the same exact word that the
[26:56] pastor's looking into I need to be
[26:59] reading exactly the same Bible that he's
[27:01] reading because how am I supposed to
[27:03] know if what he's feeding me is sheet
[27:05] food if I don't know what sheet food is
[27:09] right now I tell you I've been guilty of
[27:12] eating food served to me that I didn't
[27:13] know what it was and it wasn't the fault
[27:16] of the person feeding me it was my fault
[27:19] because I didn't go look at what I was
[27:21] being fed I just accepted it and said oh
[27:23] well it's coming from the ministry
[27:25] building the house it must be good
[27:27] that's not good enough
[27:29] you have to make sure that the material
[27:31] being used to build you is from
[27:34] God does that make
[27:37] sense preaching the gospel is not just
[27:41] standing behind a Pulpit and preaching
[27:43] the
[27:44] word he says that the gospel did not
[27:46] come to us in word only but in power and
[27:50] demonstrations of the holy spirit so to
[27:53] me it's not just somebody who can who
[27:55] can preach well or speak well it's
[27:58] somebody when you look at their life
[27:59] when they're not standing behind this
[28:02] Pulpit that their life actually preaches
[28:04] louder than the words that they're
[28:06] saying that the manifestation of the
[28:09] Holy Spirit what does that mean in signs
[28:10] and wonders no no the fruit of that
[28:13] spirit is evident in their life that's
[28:16] somebody you can say okay you can come
[28:17] and work on this
[28:19] house because this house can can
[28:22] everybody just say this house this house
[28:25] is a house of
[28:26] God this house needs to be built up to
[28:29] God would be pleased to come and dwell
[28:31] in it and so it's important that you as
[28:36] the house look at what you're being
[28:38] built with and who is building
[28:41] you I hope that I hope that that's okay
[28:44] to put that responsibility on
[28:46] you it is important brother Dan it's
[28:49] it's actually one of the most important
[28:50] things you you can
[28:53] do and and the the beautiful part is
[28:56] that if the ministry is operating
[28:57] properly it's not building the house of
[28:59] God according to their
[29:01] ideas according to their specifications
[29:04] you know I have a a part of my job um
[29:07] this is going to be a little bit boring
[29:08] so you just bear with me part of part of
[29:10] my job is is is a little bit boring it's
[29:12] like I just stare at uh plans blueprints
[29:15] all day it's it's it's that boring that
[29:18] reaction you had is exactly how boring
[29:20] it is it's just you stare at plans all
[29:23] day and it's just 2D images sometimes
[29:26] they're graceful and they give you like
[29:27] a roughly 3D but you just stare at them
[29:30] and I I I hope this analogy makes sense
[29:32] cuz this this is how I think of things
[29:34] you know if I'm reading that plan and
[29:36] and and and there's a there's so much
[29:38] information on that plan that you
[29:39] actually can't fit it all on one page
[29:42] okay so you get even just a simple house
[29:44] let alone a building like this but a
[29:45] simple house might be might be 15 20
[29:47] pages and if I'm staring at that page
[29:50] and it tells me I'm going somewhere with
[29:52] this it tells me that that a wall
[29:54] belongs right here okay it tells me
[29:55] about this wall and I look at that that
[29:58] wall and it says okay you need to build
[29:59] a wall right there it tells you where it
[30:00] goes and you take off you have the
[30:02] blueprint you've read in your Bible it
[30:05] says resist the devil and he will flee
[30:07] from you you say okay I'm going to go
[30:08] and I'm going to Build That Wall and you
[30:10] go to Build That Wall you immediately
[30:12] are going to have questions if you if
[30:13] you know what you're doing you're going
[30:14] to say well wait a minute um I can't see
[30:17] from a top down view how tall that wall
[30:20] is what if I only build the wall this
[30:24] High what if I build it too high and now
[30:26] it's sticking out into the weather
[30:29] what do you need you have to go and find
[30:32] in the blueprint that
[30:34] information and listen I I know this is
[30:36] a stretch but you cannot do that if you
[30:39] just want to see things from your
[30:41] perspective wow you have to go back into
[30:44] the blueprint and you have to search and
[30:47] first of all to even do this okay to
[30:49] even do this let's put on our spiritual
[30:51] cap we're not we're not building a
[30:52] physical house let's put on our
[30:53] spiritual think cap to even do this you
[30:56] have to first say I don't have all the
[30:58] information and right there gets about
[31:01] 90% of Christians
[31:03] today I don't have all of what I need to
[31:07] do this job instead a lot of Christians
[31:10] and I've been guilty this oh I know it
[31:14] because I've read the Bible and I've
[31:15] listened to the message I know what it
[31:17] is I need to know and I know that this
[31:18] brother or so and so is telling me
[31:20] something else but you know what I
[31:21] really know what the truth is I know
[31:22] what it is I've had something revealed
[31:24] to me and no doubt we've had things
[31:26] revealed but it just so happen happens
[31:28] that someone else might have that other
[31:30] page that you need to look on to see how
[31:33] tall that wall is and God will do that
[31:36] on
[31:37] purpose just to see if you'll go and
[31:39] seek out that
[31:40] information just to go and see if you
[31:42] will be willing to look at something
[31:45] from somebody else's perspective and I
[31:47] think maybe I was speaking here before
[31:49] and I think I did this uh maybe not but
[31:51] I think it's a great uh example if I
[31:53] were to say
[31:55] um Joe
[31:58] well let's
[32:00] see I'm want to pick on somebody who can
[32:02] I pick
[32:04] on Daniel I like that you got
[32:07] volunteered I I I didn't I I didn't plan
[32:10] on saying this you just forgive me but
[32:12] brother Daniel I think I picked on
[32:14] brother Aaron before what is the what's
[32:16] the front of this Pulpit look
[32:18] like it's a
[32:22] cross brother Dan do you see a cross I
[32:24] don't you think brother you I love
[32:26] brother Daniel yeah but he's he's off
[32:29] the word not right he's off the word if
[32:32] if only I could get him the revelation
[32:35] of what I
[32:37] see if only I could get you the
[32:39] Revelation that there isn't a cross on
[32:40] there there's like a door there's a
[32:42] light there's a Bible you don't see any
[32:44] of that uh you just need to come up a
[32:45] little higher
[32:46] brother you just right you just anybody
[32:49] hear that phrase you just need to oh you
[32:50] just need a little bit more Revelation
[32:52] you need to come up a little bit higher
[32:53] you need to come and stand where I'm
[32:55] standing and yet he has a perfectly and
[32:57] so to everybody here a perfectly
[33:00] truthful view of what the front of this
[33:02] Pulpit looks
[33:03] like and yes do I have a view that maybe
[33:06] you don't see but who needs to be
[33:09] willing to say you know what I'm going
[33:10] to go and I'm going to see exactly what
[33:12] it is you're talking about oh there is a
[33:14] cross right there oh you know what the
[33:16] Bible does say that oh you know what
[33:18] when when the prophet of God said this
[33:20] maybe he really did mean this but the
[33:23] the thing is is I haven't walked if I'm
[33:25] not willing to walk a mile in your shoes
[33:27] that right out of the word I better be
[33:29] able to to walk a mile in your shoes and
[33:31] then maybe I'll see where you're coming
[33:33] from cuz maybe you went through
[33:35] something brother Daniel that put you in
[33:37] that position right there where you're
[33:38] sitting where that view of the word now
[33:41] the word isn't just four sides the word
[33:43] is eternal but let's just say this is
[33:45] the word your view of the word was
[33:47] shaped by your experience that put you
[33:49] right in that chair and because I
[33:51] haven't been through that experience
[33:52] this is so simple so I know I I know you
[33:54] can't miss this it's so simple but your
[33:57] experence put you right there and if I'm
[34:00] not willing to see something from
[34:01] another perspective there is no possible
[34:04] way I could know the word of
[34:06] God and then there's no possible way my
[34:09] house can be built
[34:11] properly anybody ever live in a house
[34:13] that's just a 2d wall nobody right
[34:17] nobody if if a Builder turn you over
[34:19] that your your house is complete it's
[34:21] beautiful and you open the door and you
[34:22] just step into the Earth on the other
[34:24] side nobody will accept the house right
[34:26] but somehow I think sometimes we're
[34:29] we're the devil it's really a trick of
[34:31] the devil to to to make us satisfied
[34:34] with one view of the word of God wow one
[34:38] view of the word of God just one vision
[34:40] of it and oh I know the whole thing look
[34:42] at it's it's 20 feet tall how deep is it
[34:45] well don't worry about that right now
[34:46] it's 20 feet tall and it's got windows
[34:48] and it's doors it's a beautiful house
[34:50] but but if you step around just a little
[34:52] bit not you have not even much just a
[34:55] little bit oh there's no side to the
[34:57] house
[34:58] there's no inside there's no roof I
[35:00] couldn't see that from where I'm at I
[35:02] and again this is so simplistic but I
[35:04] think that we I think and I know that we
[35:07] do this sometimes just as individuals
[35:10] and we do it as a church as well because
[35:12] uh generally a church is a collective of
[35:14] people who think the same way and so but
[35:17] as individuals I think we we really
[35:20] limit how much of the word of God we can
[35:22] experience by not taking in somebody
[35:25] else's experience
[35:28] by not taking in a perspective of
[35:30] somebody else and you you you you you go
[35:33] try to Build That Wall and you just how
[35:35] wide is it how tall is it what's on the
[35:37] other side of it is it painted is it dry
[35:39] well what it you don't know because all
[35:41] you have is the information now you can
[35:42] go back to the blueprint and you can
[35:44] check it but but but the Lord is so good
[35:47] he's been taking that same blueprint and
[35:48] he's been showing somebody else that
[35:50] page of the
[35:52] plan now if you want to say well I want
[35:54] to know everything first of all that's
[35:56] not how God works
[35:59] God's going to put you in a if if you
[36:01] won't if I will not willingly I'm just
[36:03] tell you how the Lord works and it's
[36:04] it's it sounds harsh but it's the most
[36:06] beautiful thing he does if I am not
[36:09] willing to go sit where brother Daniel's
[36:12] sitting and see that perspective of the
[36:14] word the Lord will cause or allow a
[36:18] trial to
[36:19] come wow for my
[36:22] benefit that puts me in that position so
[36:25] then I can look up and see exact actly
[36:27] what it is I needed to
[36:30] see you say oh trials are hard yes
[36:33] there's trials and yet we're not
[36:37] dismayed we're in a fight and yet we're
[36:39] not
[36:40] defeated we're in those things because
[36:43] God is saying I want you to look at me
[36:46] in a different light I I I don't care if
[36:49] you've been a Christian for 10 days or
[36:51] 10
[36:52] years you have not seen all there is of
[36:56] God Amen and and I I I would go to far
[36:59] as to say if we ever ever ever get in
[37:02] the position spiritually in our mind
[37:04] where we think we've seen all of God I
[37:06] would say that's that's about as close
[37:07] to blasphemy as you could
[37:10] get because BL because God is eternal
[37:13] and you can never see every side of
[37:17] him he
[37:19] always if you don't take anything else
[37:21] take this he always has A New
[37:23] Perspective for you to see him
[37:25] in even after he takes you and I go and
[37:28] I he puts me through a trial and I'm
[37:30] sitting where brother Daniel's sitting
[37:31] and I see that guess what there's
[37:33] another side over here there's another
[37:35] side from here there's another side from
[37:37] here and it's an eternal word we're
[37:38] talking about a four-sided
[37:40] Pulpit it's an eternal word of God wow
[37:44] and you can come back to the blueprint
[37:47] we know that but it's really God wanted
[37:49] to show a different perspective you know
[37:50] um the prophet of God I'm I'm going to
[37:52] keep moving I hope I didn't take too
[37:53] long with that but he says there's two
[37:55] places where two different men are
[37:56] speaking of justification let's just
[37:58] take it back to the Bible now if if you
[38:00] if you want to believe what I'm telling
[38:01] you that's good but let's go right to
[38:02] the Bible and we'll find it two
[38:05] different men speaking of justification
[38:06] one of them was Paul one was Peter Peter
[38:09] was justifying
[38:11] Abraham I'm sorry Paul was justifying
[38:14] Abraham by his
[38:16] faith talked about Abraham talked about
[38:18] his faith Peter however was justifying
[38:20] Abraham by his
[38:23] works now you might be in the Paul side
[38:26] of things and this is what the devil
[38:27] wants us to do okay are you for Paul or
[38:30] are you for Peter that's
[38:33] right and you know brother Dan he's not
[38:35] exactly for Paul he's more of a Peter
[38:37] guy but I kind of see Paul so how about
[38:39] I just start another
[38:41] church I'm just going to say the way it
[38:43] is I'm going to start another church and
[38:45] anybody that likes Peter more hey we
[38:48] preach Peter over here we preach Peter
[38:51] now we like Paul but but Peter it's
[38:54] about works and then let me show you all
[38:56] the quotes that I have about works and
[38:59] then I can back up what I'm telling you
[39:00] and pretty soon I have you convinced
[39:02] that my perspective is the right one wow
[39:06] but if we look at the full thing he says
[39:08] Paul said he was justified by faith
[39:10] Peter by works now they did not
[39:13] contradict one
[39:15] another right out of the message they
[39:18] were looking at it from two different
[39:21] viewpoints Paul was speaking of
[39:23] Abraham's Faith that's what God saw in
[39:26] Abraham
[39:29] and Peter was talking about his works
[39:33] now listen we believe in works but yet
[39:36] we also believe that you can't do enough
[39:38] works to be good enough to go it's
[39:42] almost a paradox right we believe in
[39:44] faith and yet the Bible says without
[39:45] works your faith is dead and and and the
[39:48] and the and the word explains it very
[39:49] simply your faith is what God looks at
[39:54] and the works of your faith is what men
[39:56] look at
[39:58] did we catch
[40:00] that because I can tell you brother
[40:02] Josiah all day what my faith
[40:04] is but you're looking at what I do
[40:07] you're looking at what I say you're
[40:09] looking at how I act you're looking at
[40:10] How I Live you're looking at how I speak
[40:13] you're looking at how I treat somebody I
[40:14] disagree with and somebody I don't
[40:16] disagree with you're not listening to me
[40:18] talk about my faith to you you're
[40:20] looking at my life and what I'm doing
[40:24] and God is exactly the opposite you can
[40:25] tell God oh God I prayed to to you oh
[40:28] God I love everybody God I do this and
[40:30] God's looking just at your faith what
[40:32] does your faith produce he's not looking
[40:34] at your works because anything good that
[40:36] you have done he did it what he's he's
[40:40] looking at your faith you can tell God
[40:41] all day what you're going to do but
[40:44] God's looking at your faith and that's
[40:46] such a simple explanation of that but
[40:48] but if you have the mentality if you
[40:51] have a spirit really upon you that does
[40:53] not allow you to see A New Perspective
[40:56] you'll start to pick side es inside of a
[40:59] Bible that we say we all believe
[41:01] in you're not even picking sides between
[41:03] Pharisees and the disciples anymore
[41:06] you're picking sides inside of disciples
[41:08] and pretty soon you'll pick sides with
[41:10] something Jesus said against something
[41:11] else Jesus
[41:13] said somebody will send a scripture to
[41:16] somebody and somebody else will send a
[41:17] scripture back oh well he also said this
[41:20] and all of a sudden we got Bible
[41:21] fighting
[41:22] Bible I don't need to go into quotes cuz
[41:25] we we know that already quotes fighting
[41:27] quotes it's it's a mess what has
[41:29] happened is we're not getting to Christ
[41:32] we're being pointed to denominational
[41:36] thinking which denominational thinking
[41:39] is really simple it's it's it's thinking
[41:40] that divides
[41:42] us that's really the simple breakdown of
[41:44] it and and he says here and Peter was
[41:47] talking about what man saw because man
[41:48] had Faith he'll act like it his life
[41:50] will show it to others I just want to
[41:51] finish that quote off uh Moses needed a
[41:54] new perspective you know Moses had seen
[41:57] God in a burning bush I would like a
[42:00] physical burning bush experience I would
[42:02] love to see a physical burning bush
[42:04] experience but then God comes to him
[42:06] again and it says later on that God
[42:08] spoke to him face to
[42:10] face so he gets one perspective of God
[42:13] and God is you know what Moses there's
[42:16] more to me than
[42:17] that there's more to me than just that
[42:19] I'm going to speak to you face to face
[42:21] and then Moses gets to a point he says
[42:23] Lord I've seen you in the burning bush
[42:25] I've spoke to you face to face but would
[42:26] you just Show Me Your
[42:28] Glory and he gets he and the Lord says
[42:31] I'll put you in the Clift of rock and he
[42:32] walks by and he says at the backside of
[42:34] the man that's not a perspective Moses
[42:36] expected he thought he was going to see
[42:38] something glorious and God gave him a
[42:40] perspective he never would have thought
[42:41] he was going to see but it was God
[42:43] saying I have so much to show you you
[42:47] just need to want to see
[42:49] it oh you say oh I want to see it I want
[42:52] to see it brother Daniel might have that
[42:55] perspective that I have for for you well
[42:58] I don't know if I want to see that
[43:00] anymore Lord show me another view of
[43:02] your word I'm going to put you together
[43:04] with this sister of this brother over
[43:05] here Lord show me a perspective of your
[43:08] word I I was trying to I was putting
[43:10] together with this brother and sister
[43:11] over here Lord show me a new perspective
[43:13] of your word and he's trying
[43:16] to and because of my stubbornness
[43:18] because of my uh my thinking that I know
[43:21] everything or maybe that I know more
[43:23] than that sister does or that brother
[43:25] does I don't go and view it from their
[43:26] persp perspective and you know what
[43:27] God's going to do from his mercy and
[43:30] Grace he's going to knock me
[43:32] down until I'll look at it from the
[43:34] point of you that I've been begging him
[43:36] to let me look at it
[43:38] from and and that's harsh that's that
[43:40] sounds like a cruel God he's not cruel
[43:44] he's not cruel he saves
[43:46] us from
[43:49] ourself it's not just from Satan right
[43:52] he saves us from oursel that's true he
[43:54] he he saved us from Satan 2,000 years
[43:56] ago really before the foundation of the
[43:58] world but today it's work he has to save
[44:01] us from oursel every single day that's
[44:04] true I want to keep keep moving here uh
[44:07] uh
[44:09] uh time is going all
[44:12] right I I want to I want to there's
[44:15] something I always have believed and I
[44:17] just talk to you from my heart if that's
[44:18] okay um I don't believe that we should
[44:20] shape oursel according to the world
[44:22] would you agree with that okay um I
[44:25] don't believe that we should spend time
[44:26] looking at the world's doing or getting
[44:28] into the things of the world would you
[44:29] agree with that okay however I do think
[44:32] it's very valuable to see what is
[44:34] happening in the world to pay attention
[44:37] to what is happening in the world
[44:38] because that is a perspective that God
[44:41] is giving you to tell you the spirits
[44:44] that you see attacking the world are the
[44:46] spirits that are attacking
[44:47] you if you want a Viewpoint if you want
[44:50] a window into what you are going to be
[44:53] battling today or tomorrow or next week
[44:55] you need to look at what what's going on
[44:56] in the the world and that's where it's
[45:00] working that's where the spirit has won
[45:03] and it's taken control and that's the
[45:05] spirit you're going to be
[45:06] battling you say well I don't think that
[45:08] we're battling in the world oh let's
[45:10] let's just talk about it um the first
[45:13] the world is so divided right
[45:15] now and angry at one another right well
[45:18] at least America is everybody hates each
[45:21] other everybody's fighting everybody's
[45:23] split into politics or this issue or
[45:25] this issue doesn't it sound a lot like
[45:27] some of the churches sometime
[45:29] yeah maybe oh you saying oh it's we're
[45:31] not split into politics uh you haven't
[45:33] been in church very
[45:35] long sometimes it's politics or maybe
[45:38] it's just a Viewpoint of of the Bible or
[45:40] Viewpoint of the message or Viewpoint of
[45:42] this doct Viewpoint of this and all of a
[45:44] sudden in our church and in our belief
[45:48] we're just divided divided divided
[45:49] divided divided divided because you can
[45:51] see out in the world where it works and
[45:53] we battle that and that is the spirit
[45:56] we're battling
[45:57] and and and I'm going to go as far as
[45:59] even say this you know maybe the spirit
[46:01] that that right now is attacking our
[46:03] nation with with men who don't know that
[46:05] they're men and women that don't know
[46:06] they women you say I don't struggle with
[46:07] that issue but yet as a church
[46:10] spiritually sometimes we struggle with
[46:11] that issue we're not in our place we
[46:15] don't know who we are we don't know who
[46:17] we are that's comes right out of the
[46:19] message we don't know sometimes who we
[46:21] are there is an identity crisis I
[46:24] believe in the Believers today that we
[46:27] don't know who we
[46:29] are and all you see when you look at
[46:31] into the world and you see somebody
[46:33] who's confused about who they are that's
[46:35] where that spirit's
[46:36] working in the physical but in the
[46:39] spiritual we're being attacked by
[46:41] that or maybe you're not being attacked
[46:44] by that but I'm being attacked by that
[46:46] it's identity it's it's literally an
[46:47] identity crisis and it's all through the
[46:49] Bible when they take when they take
[46:51] Daniel and the Hebrew children and they
[46:53] take them over and they capture them and
[46:56] they're and they're living with
[46:57] foreigners they're living in the world
[47:00] the first thing that they try to do is
[47:02] get them to forget who they are wow they
[47:05] say we're going to change your names to
[47:07] these different
[47:10] names
[47:13] physical you say well we have the same
[47:15] name we've always had okay then they'll
[47:17] try then the second thing they did was
[47:18] try to change their
[47:20] diet physically how about spiritually
[47:24] you know what it's okay it's okay maybe
[47:26] just let brother Dan read the Bible and
[47:29] listen to the tapes and you just listen
[47:31] to what brother Dan says now I know
[47:33] brother Dan's not telling you that but I
[47:36] believe that spirit's
[47:38] attack that will tell you you know what
[47:40] you don't need to dig into that word for
[47:41] yourself just take whatever the the
[47:44] they're building the house just sit back
[47:45] and relax and let the house be
[47:47] built that's a spirit that's trying to
[47:50] take away your
[47:52] identity and I Know a Man LED from God I
[47:55] know brother Dan's LED from God because
[47:56] I think he'll be the first person to
[47:57] tell you you go get in that Bible you go
[48:00] pick up that bible you hit your knees
[48:03] you you read a message you read you read
[48:05] a scripture you do that so that when he
[48:08] comes out here and starts preaching
[48:10] you're like oh yeah I read that I know
[48:12] what that's about I know exactly where
[48:13] he said that oh you know what I hadn't
[48:15] heard that before but when I take what
[48:17] you just said and I take it with what I
[48:18] know I got a fresh new perspective right
[48:21] now CU it's just as dangerous for me to
[48:25] only have the perspective I of one
[48:27] Minister as it is just to have my
[48:31] own we are a we are a multi membered
[48:35] body which means think about it now we
[48:38] have every advantage over the
[48:41] devil we have every advantage over the
[48:43] devil because we have your perspective
[48:45] brother your perspective sister your
[48:47] perspective sister your your experience
[48:49] you've been through there's not
[48:51] something that the devil can attack you
[48:52] with that somebody in here hasn't gone
[48:55] through or is going through or you know
[48:58] the Lord brought me through that just
[48:59] come and talk to me a little bit and
[49:01] I'll tell you how he got me through that
[49:03] trial but if you want to sit over there
[49:05] by yourself and I don't know how I'm
[49:06] going to make it I don't know how I'm be
[49:07] delivered it's the devil forcing you to
[49:09] look at things just through your
[49:11] eyes but yet seek out somebody else you
[49:14] know what brother I I hate to bring this
[49:16] up but I know maybe you struggle with
[49:18] drinking how did you overcome that oh
[49:20] this is exactly how I overcame it now I
[49:22] don't know if this is going to work for
[49:23] you but here's how that Pulpit looks
[49:24] like from my point of view and I'll tell
[49:26] tell you what the word of God works like
[49:28] this if he did it one way for one person
[49:32] he'll do it same way for you but what
[49:35] you have to do is you have to go seek
[49:36] out how he did it for that person which
[49:39] takes you and I this is the hard part
[49:41] saying I don't
[49:44] know and that's like some of the hardest
[49:47] words is I don't know and I'm
[49:50] wrong and yet that is what God is asking
[49:54] of his
[49:55] people that's
[49:57] I don't have it with me but I I there is
[49:59] a quote that says that he wants you and
[50:02] I to
[50:03] say I am
[50:06] wrong because then only then can he
[50:11] actually teach you
[50:16] yes he's trying to do the same thing to
[50:18] us he's trying to get us to feed on I'm
[50:21] sorry but there's uh this may be
[50:23] unpopular opinion there's no good news I
[50:26] don't care if it's Fox News or CNN or
[50:29] this other website it's all the same
[50:34] thing I'm sorry there's no good
[50:37] political
[50:38] party I I I'm sorry there just isn't one
[50:41] yeah is there one that might be better
[50:42] than the other it's the it's the it's
[50:44] two sides of the same
[50:46] coin the goal is to bring down anybody
[50:51] who is a God's
[50:53] child there is no middle ground there is
[50:57] the seed of God and everything
[51:00] else there is no neutral party there is
[51:03] there are people that are certainly nice
[51:05] and kind but if they're not a seed of
[51:06] God they are against
[51:12] you that's a that's my perspective you
[51:14] don't have to accept that and you say
[51:16] well that sounds pretty cynical it's
[51:18] it's it's not cynical it's be
[51:21] guarded be guarded against yeah you you
[51:25] said it yesterday brother Dan you know
[51:27] we we are not looking at sometimes what
[51:28] God is doing today but we certainly look
[51:31] at what the devil is doing to us
[51:33] today that's a trick of the devil to
[51:35] keep your focus on his
[51:39] perspective oh he doesn't have control
[51:41] of me all he has to do is introduce a
[51:43] little bit of bad news a little bit of
[51:45] uh anxiety a little bit of uh bad
[51:47] feelings a little bit of this and pretty
[51:48] soon you're looking at your church your
[51:51] life your family your walk with God from
[51:54] Satan's perspective and if you look at
[51:56] it from his perspective I'm sorry but
[51:58] you're lost cuz he's telling you you're
[52:01] lost he's telling you you're no good
[52:04] he's telling you you can't be healed
[52:06] he's telling you you can't be delivered
[52:08] of that and if you listen to that you're
[52:11] seeing everything from his perspective
[52:13] and God's on the other side saying I've
[52:15] already delivered you I've already
[52:18] healed you I've already done these
[52:20] things but you need to look at it from
[52:22] my point of view but so many times in
[52:25] this message I'm just going to go I just
[52:26] let's go on a little tangent if that's
[52:27] okay uh okay A lot of times we hear in
[52:30] the message uh I'm the the sisters get
[52:33] real beat up sometimes when you listen
[52:36] to tapes when you listen to preaching
[52:38] it's always about how the sisters are
[52:40] dressed how the sisters hair how the
[52:42] sisters skirts how the sisters are doing
[52:43] this right and I believe in that I I
[52:45] believe in what it says and then a lot
[52:47] of times in the message brother bam will
[52:48] go okay now I'm going to talk to you uh
[52:50] Brothers for a little bit can I just
[52:51] talk to you Brothers for a little
[52:52] bit he'll
[52:54] say you men that'll let your wives do
[52:59] that and I just be honest brother Dan
[53:02] when I heard when I hear that you've
[53:03] heard it a lot right he I kind of was
[53:05] like oh that wasn't that bad right am I
[53:09] alone brothers or am I the only one that
[53:11] it was like man he kind of really he
[53:13] spent like five minutes like getting on
[53:14] the sisters and then when the men he's
[53:16] like and you men that'll let your wives
[53:18] do that and it was like one sentence I
[53:19] was like I wasn't too bad right oh was
[53:22] pretty good yeah and then what happens
[53:24] is now you don't have to say Amen to
[53:26] this part but what happens is is men
[53:28] will hear that and they'll go yeah you
[53:31] know what uh let's sit down wife you're
[53:35] dressing like this you're talking like
[53:36] this you're gossiping like this you're
[53:38] wearing this you're acting this way and
[53:40] and the and the and the message says
[53:42] that I shouldn't allow you to do that so
[53:44] now they take that little quote and they
[53:46] go and they start clubbing their wife
[53:48] over the head with it and trying to beat
[53:50] her into submission but really if you
[53:52] look at that quote from another point of
[53:54] view what brother randam is saying he's
[53:55] saying you men that let your wives do
[53:58] that meaning your wife is doing that
[54:00] because you spiritually or physically
[54:02] are doing that your wife is out of order
[54:05] because you're out of order and you say
[54:08] oh no no no my wife no you don't
[54:10] understand brother I tell my wife to do
[54:12] this I tell my wife to live this way I
[54:14] tell my wife to pray I tell my wife to
[54:17] to pray with our children you it's going
[54:20] to get quiet for me too because this is
[54:22] the truth I tell my wife to do this and
[54:25] and she doesn't listen to me me and the
[54:27] problem is is that she is listening to
[54:29] you she's doing exactly what you
[54:32] do so if she doesn't see you running
[54:36] your household like a man of God how is
[54:38] she going to run her household like a
[54:40] woman of God you say well I don't I
[54:43] don't dress him properly I don't do this
[54:45] but if you're not being the example of
[54:47] the household then the perspective that
[54:49] your wife has is
[54:53] you wow or or are we the kind of are we
[54:56] the kind let's just put on our spiritual
[54:58] thinking cap are the we kind of ministry
[55:00] or pastors or churches that tell
[55:02] somebody how to live but don't live it
[55:05] ourself we sometimes we have no problem
[55:08] telling somebody what's in the Bible oh
[55:10] if you just read what's in the Bible
[55:11] they said don't do that but are we
[55:13] living
[55:14] it wow are we the kind I'm sorry welcome
[55:17] to being the man of the
[55:19] house that's the man of the house oh man
[55:22] it's the man of the house right we're
[55:23] just the right brother brother Dan I
[55:25] don't envy your job is the pastor
[55:27] because you're the man of the house
[55:29] you're the man of the house and for our
[55:31] houses I'm sorry man but if something's
[55:33] going on in our houses you may not like
[55:35] me very much but this applies to me and
[55:37] I've been guilty of this and when I say
[55:40] I've been guilty I don't mean 10 years
[55:41] ago I mean like
[55:44] yesterday if your house is out of
[55:47] order they're doing they're following
[55:52] you that's not a pleasant perspective
[55:55] but if you want to see the the way to
[55:58] get through it you'll say Lord that's
[56:01] hard but I want to look at it from that
[56:03] perspective Lord how do I get in
[56:07] line so then my children and my wife
[56:10] look at me and I don't have to beat him
[56:12] in line with the message in the Bible
[56:14] and preaching just live it and watch
[56:17] them go oh I want to be that way oh
[56:20] that's how I want to be you give them A
[56:23] New Perspective
[56:31] I'm um I'm trying to hurry now he
[56:39] says I think I think we see the same
[56:42] thing today with uh I I I I feel like
[56:44] every everywhere I go I just head on
[56:46] Fellowship between churches but I feel
[56:47] like everywhere I go I see some I see in
[56:50] myself I see in our church I see that
[56:52] that is the battle W that's a battle to
[56:56] to have fellowship and and the reason
[56:57] why is because we don't always see the
[56:59] same way now I gave you the example
[57:02] brother Daniel saying that that's that's
[57:03] what that Pulpit looks like but now just
[57:05] just take the pulpit out of it and just
[57:07] add the Bible which now has you know
[57:09] thousands and thousands of words in it
[57:11] and let's not even talk about the
[57:13] message on top of that which has
[57:14] thousands and thousands of words and all
[57:16] the different points of view is a
[57:18] perfectly good reason not to have
[57:20] fellowship with
[57:22] somebody perfectly good reason right
[57:25] just it's a good reason they don't see
[57:27] it like I see it and I know I've been
[57:29] given Revelation so I must be
[57:33] right I don't think we ever like say
[57:35] that out loud but I think sometimes our
[57:37] actions are that
[57:39] way um but
[57:42] until you've walked a mile in their
[57:45] shoes sometimes individually and
[57:48] sometimes as a church as well I believe
[57:49] that this church has been through things
[57:51] that maybe another church hasn't been
[57:52] through would you say Amen to that am
[57:56] but they've also been through something
[57:57] you haven't been
[57:59] through you say I just don't understand
[58:02] how that church could see things that
[58:03] way maybe go walk a mile in their shoes
[58:06] maybe go up against the persecutions
[58:08] that they've been under maybe suffer
[58:11] like they've
[58:16] suffered and it's like somebody can
[58:18] battle just think about this somebody
[58:20] can battle I'm I'm going to confess to
[58:22] you a little bit like you know I have I
[58:24] have friends I have family members that
[58:25] battle battle
[58:27] anxiety and I haven't battled
[58:30] that and if I'm being honest with you
[58:32] it's very hard for me to see it from
[58:33] their
[58:35] perspective not that I don't care for
[58:37] them not that I don't pray for them not
[58:38] that I don't you know want Deliverance
[58:40] for them but I have a I have trouble
[58:43] empathizing I'm just I'm just bearing it
[58:45] all out for you right now it's the truth
[58:47] I'm not proud of it I have trouble
[58:50] understanding why you could be anxious
[58:52] for something because I don't have
[58:54] anxiety but yet that same person might
[58:57] look at me and go you battle with
[59:00] this that's that's like why would you
[59:02] battle with that you ever feel like I'm
[59:05] not going to tell anybody my battle
[59:08] because there's no way anybody else
[59:09] battles with
[59:10] this or there's no way anybody would
[59:13] even understand why I would be battling
[59:15] I've been a Christian for x amount of
[59:17] months years whatever it is I shouldn't
[59:18] be battling that I'm just going to hold
[59:20] that insight and keep it to
[59:21] myself and how is somebody else you know
[59:24] the Bible says confess your sins not to
[59:29] him one to another because what you've
[59:32] now done is you've now given somebody
[59:34] who has the right
[59:36] Spirit who's who's willing to get down
[59:39] with you and kneel and pray you've given
[59:41] them a perspective that they didn't have
[59:43] before and now they can stand
[59:46] shoulder-to-shoulder with you and they
[59:47] can go into that battle going okay Lord
[59:49] I don't battle this anxiety but I have
[59:51] been given a perspective of I never had
[59:53] before and and I just that's that's why
[59:56] I think it was so it's it's so beautiful
[59:58] when you see through the Bible you see
[59:59] it with Jesus and you see it of course
[1:00:01] in the message that that that the Lord
[1:00:04] allowed people's the discernment think
[1:00:07] about discernment
[1:00:10] now I'm just preaching about what we
[1:00:12] read about in the
[1:00:13] message there's a lot of times that
[1:00:15] ministers or or or people don't suffer
[1:00:18] through some of the things people suffer
[1:00:19] through well that's my
[1:00:23] timer they don't suffer I told you I
[1:00:26] ignore it but I was really trying to
[1:00:27] okay they don't suffer through things
[1:00:30] people suffer through and yet through
[1:00:31] discernment God
[1:00:33] allowed God allowed Jesus to see exactly
[1:00:35] what somebody was going
[1:00:37] through why so that he could enter in to
[1:00:41] that you know what discernment became in
[1:00:43] some of the prayer lines and even when
[1:00:44] you see it in the Bible it became a
[1:00:47] Viewpoint instantly into that person's
[1:00:50] life because how is even
[1:00:53] Jesus supposed to enter in for you
[1:00:56] if he wasn't tempted in all things and
[1:00:59] the Bible allowed him to be tempted in
[1:01:01] not some things if I'm telling you right
[1:01:03] now if you battle something in
[1:01:05] 2024 Jesus was tempted with
[1:01:08] it why so that he knows your perspective
[1:01:13] he knows what you're going through CU
[1:01:15] he's seen the world he's seen Satan and
[1:01:18] he's seen living life through that exact
[1:01:20] same perspective and yet without
[1:01:23] sin so that when he entered enters in
[1:01:26] with you it's
[1:01:29] true there's a scripture that says this
[1:01:31] I it's in John 16:12 it says if you want
[1:01:34] to write it down it says I have many
[1:01:36] things to say unto you but you cannot
[1:01:39] bear them
[1:01:40] now now I love that scripture because
[1:01:43] one he's going to tell you many things
[1:01:45] and and you are going to be able to Bear
[1:01:48] them isn't that beautiful that he has a
[1:01:51] word for you that maybe today you
[1:01:54] couldn't handle how about the maybe this
[1:01:56] morning when you woke up you couldn't
[1:01:58] handle it but maybe right now you can
[1:02:00] that's how God does things just like
[1:02:02] that look through the Bible and see how
[1:02:04] many times God says the word
[1:02:08] immediately immediately when God does
[1:02:11] something well I better wait 20 years
[1:02:13] and then I can get this word from God I
[1:02:14] can bear you can bear it you might be
[1:02:16] able to Bear something right now that
[1:02:17] you couldn't bear five minutes ago
[1:02:20] because that's what the power of God
[1:02:22] changing your perspective can do for you
[1:02:25] and he says
[1:02:26] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[1:02:28] come he will guide you into all Truth
[1:02:32] for he shall not speak of himself but
[1:02:35] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:02:37] speak and he will show you things to
[1:02:39] come every spirit-led person I believe
[1:02:42] your
[1:02:45] spirit-led you have to get out of your
[1:02:47] own way
[1:02:49] first that's like that's the hardest
[1:02:52] thing for us to do is get out of our own
[1:02:53] way we always want to say it's Satan in
[1:02:55] our way it's so and so in our way it's
[1:02:56] brother this it's brother that sister
[1:02:58] this it's work whatever it is I'm sorry
[1:03:00] but we're in our own way there there
[1:03:02] there's a quote I just love this quote
[1:03:04] it's so it's so small he says um uh I
[1:03:07] was told a little bit of time ago they
[1:03:08] had a jet plane that can make those
[1:03:10] noises we hear around shakes the windows
[1:03:12] when the plane has gotten so fast it
[1:03:15] crosses its own sound it's called the
[1:03:17] sound barrier and when it goes beyond
[1:03:19] its own sound listen to this when it
[1:03:21] goes beyond its own sound it's almost
[1:03:24] unlimited what it can do
[1:03:27] it's not it's not you going
[1:03:29] beyond the sound of your
[1:03:34] pastor it's not you going beyond the
[1:03:36] sound of ministry it's not you going
[1:03:38] beyond the sound of your church it's not
[1:03:39] you going beyond the sound of your your
[1:03:41] husband and your wife it's you going
[1:03:43] beyond your own sound which be which
[1:03:47] means your point of view your
[1:03:48] perspective all the things you think all
[1:03:50] the things you believe you've got to go
[1:03:52] beyond
[1:03:53] that and when and if you go beyond that
[1:03:57] because sometimes it's overwhelming is
[1:03:58] it overwhelming a little bit Danel like
[1:04:00] okay what perspective am I supposed to
[1:04:02] have now I'm really confused just step
[1:04:04] outside your
[1:04:05] own and the spirit of truth will be
[1:04:08] there to lead you to the perspective
[1:04:12] that is right for that time and that
[1:04:15] place but you have to be able to go
[1:04:18] beyond your own sound your own feelings
[1:04:22] your own opinion even your own
[1:04:24] experience and and your own
[1:04:26] Revelation no doubt they're good I I
[1:04:29] don't I don't take away anybody's
[1:04:32] experience but God has more
[1:04:35] experience I don't take away your
[1:04:37] salvation it's probably I I would say
[1:04:40] isn't it the greatest day of your
[1:04:42] life but there's
[1:04:44] more and if you can get beyond your own
[1:04:47] sound it's almost unlimited what you do
[1:04:49] don't worry about what perspective you
[1:04:51] need to go see the spirit of truth will
[1:04:54] lead you exactly where you need to go in
[1:04:56] that and he says and he can show you
[1:04:59] things that you've never seen and take
[1:05:02] you to places you've never been before I
[1:05:06] he didn't he didn't say that was for the
[1:05:10] newcomer the the the person who just
[1:05:12] became a Believer that's for every
[1:05:14] single one of us there are places in
[1:05:16] this word and in God you have never been
[1:05:20] before do you want to go there do you
[1:05:23] want to experience it do want to see
[1:05:26] things from a different angle from a
[1:05:28] different perspective every spirit-led
[1:05:31] person wants
[1:05:34] that it it it's so I love this he says
[1:05:38] maybe if your healings lingered a bit
[1:05:41] watch watch the perspective God
[1:05:43] has I think sometimes brother Dan I I'm
[1:05:46] praying for something and I don't it
[1:05:48] doesn't happen right away and I think
[1:05:49] this is what I think God must look at me
[1:05:52] and be like oh you're so like why aren't
[1:05:55] you getting it
[1:05:57] ah why aren't you just why aren't you
[1:05:59] doing this why aren't you believing this
[1:06:01] way why aren't you praying this way why
[1:06:02] aren't you just have
[1:06:03] faith that's what I would
[1:06:07] do God isn't me his ways are not my ways
[1:06:11] and and I got to tell you this he his
[1:06:13] ways are not your ways
[1:06:14] either you ever prayed for healing and
[1:06:16] you it didn't come you ever prayed for
[1:06:19] deliverance and it hasn't maybe you're
[1:06:20] doing that right
[1:06:22] now maybe if you're here's right out of
[1:06:24] the right out of the word maybe if your
[1:06:26] healing is Linger a little bit God has
[1:06:28] got confidence in
[1:06:31] you that you will hold
[1:06:34] on look at his
[1:06:37] perspective his perspective is the one I
[1:06:41] want and guess what he wants to give it
[1:06:43] to you in fact he's trying to do that
[1:06:45] right out of here out of two
[1:06:46] sentences but do I remember that when
[1:06:48] I'm going through the battle I'm
[1:06:50] attacked on all sides do I see it from
[1:06:52] his perspective I I'm I'm I'm I'm shoved
[1:06:55] down To The Ground by enemy do I see it
[1:06:57] from his perspective that I'm not no I'm
[1:06:58] not
[1:06:59] defeated I've not been beaten I'm not
[1:07:02] I'm not I'm not going to give up I don't
[1:07:05] know about you but there I'm not giving
[1:07:07] up I I do I feel like giving up yes I
[1:07:10] feel like giving up there's a lot of
[1:07:12] times I feel I just being honest with
[1:07:14] you there's times it's like oh this is
[1:07:15] It's hard I'm not giving
[1:07:18] up if it cost me my life if it cost me
[1:07:21] everything that I have I'm not giving up
[1:07:27] there's there's I believe that you have
[1:07:30] to claim that though brother Dan can't
[1:07:32] claim that for you brother brandom can't
[1:07:34] claim that for you Jesus himself cannot
[1:07:36] come down and claim that for you he
[1:07:38] cannot force his perspective upon
[1:07:42] you now what he'll do is he might knock
[1:07:44] you down you know there's there's a
[1:07:45] there's a guy we probably have heard of
[1:07:47] him there's a guy who is traveling on a
[1:07:49] horse to a
[1:07:51] town he didn't have a particularly good
[1:07:53] view of God in fact fact he persecuted
[1:07:56] those that believed in God
[1:07:58] Paul and he had a certain perspective
[1:08:00] when he's traveling down this road and
[1:08:03] in order he just wouldn't come to God
[1:08:07] but in order for him to come to God
[1:08:08] because he was a seed and the greatest
[1:08:11] sign the Bible says that you are mine is
[1:08:13] that I rebuke and chastise you sometimes
[1:08:15] the greatest sign that you're his is
[1:08:17] that he might let you get knocked down
[1:08:19] so that you can see it from a different
[1:08:20] point of view he literally knocks him
[1:08:22] off his horse now he's laying on the
[1:08:25] ground and I love this he goes and what
[1:08:27] does he see he sees a light he doesn't
[1:08:31] see he doesn't see anything but a light
[1:08:33] and he's and and he sees a light and yet
[1:08:35] the light speaks to him and says and it
[1:08:37] gives him an even
[1:08:38] higher perspective and says I'm not just
[1:08:41] a light I'm
[1:08:45] Jesus I'm not just a good scripture a
[1:08:49] good quote a good message I am Jesus if
[1:08:51] you want to see where I'm at literally
[1:08:53] gave him a new perspective there's there
[1:08:55] we're talking about Moses I'm I'm
[1:08:57] closing talking about
[1:09:00] Moses God looks at the children of
[1:09:02] Israel and you realize he gets so angry
[1:09:05] at the children of Israel that he says
[1:09:07] I'm going to wipe them
[1:09:10] out that doesn't sound like a very good
[1:09:12] perspective of God right and yet the
[1:09:15] spirit of God in
[1:09:18] Moses has a different
[1:09:21] perspective so God has a perspective he
[1:09:23] says you know what they make me so mad
[1:09:25] I'm just going to wipe him out and I'm
[1:09:26] going to start over and then God because
[1:09:28] he's balanced because he sees all things
[1:09:31] because he's looked at everything from
[1:09:33] every point of view because he's Eternal
[1:09:36] God himself in Moses said no let me give
[1:09:39] you a new
[1:09:40] perspective not new but let me show you
[1:09:42] where I'm looking at before you wipe
[1:09:44] them out you have to wipe me
[1:09:46] out God himself realizing not realizing
[1:09:51] because he doesn't learn anything new
[1:09:53] but God himself knowing I I need to see
[1:09:56] things from All Points of View it's not
[1:09:59] just enough that I can react angrily and
[1:10:01] wipe out the the people that I've worked
[1:10:04] so hard to deliver no no there's me over
[1:10:06] there saying oh no wait wait a minute
[1:10:08] walk a mile in my shoes come over here
[1:10:10] where I'm sitting I'm Daniel I'm sitting
[1:10:12] over here look at the children of isra
[1:10:13] from my point of view oh they're
[1:10:15] beautiful they're my children I love
[1:10:17] them I'm going to die for
[1:10:20] them and God being God is satisfied with
[1:10:25] with
[1:10:26] that to me that is like it it is the
[1:10:29] most like beautiful thing of God is that
[1:10:31] he doesn't do what I do he doesn't react
[1:10:33] upon a singular point of view he doesn't
[1:10:36] react upon emotion he doesn't react upon
[1:10:39] 10e of belief system built into him he
[1:10:42] doesn't react on those
[1:10:43] things he sees things from the proper
[1:10:46] perspective and I'm going to I'm going
[1:10:48] to close with this
[1:10:51] um is continuing that that that quote he
[1:10:54] says when you receive the holy spirit
[1:10:55] and get born again then the devil begins
[1:10:58] to tempt
[1:11:00] you you being
[1:11:02] tempted anybody being tempted all right
[1:11:06] that's good news from this perspective
[1:11:09] that's good
[1:11:10] news that means you got the Holy
[1:11:15] Spirit oh and he says oh you're wearing
[1:11:17] the same clothes and you look like you
[1:11:19] used to devil ever come and tell you I
[1:11:21] thought you were born again here you are
[1:11:23] thinking the same thoughts you used to
[1:11:24] think here are doing the same things you
[1:11:26] used to think he's trying his best to
[1:11:29] get you away from that New Perspective
[1:11:31] that you've been
[1:11:33] given but God changed
[1:11:37] you and you are sure that something
[1:11:40] happened inside of you and God changed
[1:11:42] your life and it doesn't make any
[1:11:44] difference what the devil says get away
[1:11:46] from it because you're sure that is
[1:11:52] God and he
[1:11:53] says we need one another now more than
[1:11:56] we ever did need one
[1:11:59] another I think about that meeting
[1:12:01] yesterday brother Dan we could go to the
[1:12:03] meeting and say you know what I didn't I
[1:12:05] don't agree with 100% of what every
[1:12:07] brother
[1:12:08] said but but I found myself thinking I I
[1:12:11] wonder what that man's been through
[1:12:15] that's really what I left wondering what
[1:12:16] has he been through to give him that
[1:12:18] point of view and I think if I could do
[1:12:21] that I I start to gain because here's
[1:12:23] the beautiful thing about God is when he
[1:12:25] gives you a new perspective you actually
[1:12:27] still keep that old one he just grows
[1:12:29] you into a house he grows you into a
[1:12:33] Christian he grows you into a child of
[1:12:35] God you don't have to you don't have to
[1:12:36] lose what you've known the Bible says I
[1:12:38] think it's in in in Peter about the
[1:12:40] stature add to
[1:12:42] yourself add to your perspective this
[1:12:45] and you start to get this this picture
[1:12:47] of who we should be as as a Christian
[1:12:49] and I I had other notes but I think I
[1:12:51] think I've taken the time that I need to
[1:12:53] take and I I pray that that
[1:12:55] that even just in these broken words
[1:12:58] that you could it doesn't matter how old
[1:13:00] you are how young you are look at this
[1:13:03] look at things from a different
[1:13:05] perspective and are there wrong persp of
[1:13:08] course there wrong perspectives if
[1:13:10] something's telling you that you're
[1:13:12] defeated take them right back over here
[1:13:15] right back over here to this Bible oh no
[1:13:16] no I'm sorry Satan you you're can attack
[1:13:18] me from all sides but you cannot defeat
[1:13:20] me you know what I may be down but I'm
[1:13:23] not dismayed I'm sorry if somebody's has
[1:13:25] given you that perspective you can feel
[1:13:26] free by the by the word of God to reject
[1:13:29] that perspective but if it's something
[1:13:31] that you don't understand let the spirit
[1:13:34] of Truth lead you where it's going to
[1:13:36] lead you amen let's just let's just
[1:13:37] stand I'll turn over to brother
[1:13:39] Dan I thank you for the for the extra
[1:13:41] time I hope I used it used it well
[1:13:46] so God bless
[1:13:53] you stay here
[1:14:02] okay brothers and sisters that was
[1:14:05] good do you appreciate
[1:14:09] that oh I uh I got to say I'm not
[1:14:14] usually like this but I wish I had a
[1:14:17] couple hours now to preach man that was
[1:14:19] really good that got me excited that was
[1:14:23] that was exactly
[1:14:25] exactly if it was for no one else it was
[1:14:27] for me brothers and sisters that was
[1:14:29] good you know what you know what I was
[1:14:30] thinking when he was closing you know I
[1:14:33] was thinking God has
[1:14:35] perspective and I thank God that through
[1:14:39] the blood of Jesus Christ through his
[1:14:41] son Jesus Christ that he is able to
[1:14:44] lower himself to see things from our
[1:14:47] perspective and I than that he is a high
[1:14:50] priest as being that is able to be
[1:14:52] touched by by our Feelings by our our
[1:14:55] sicknesses by our needs and as he was
[1:14:58] closing I was thinking the devil has a
[1:15:00] perspective too and one day it's going
[1:15:03] to
[1:15:04] be
[1:15:06] [Applause]
[1:15:09] y the bottom of the souls of the feet of
[1:15:12] God's Saints one day it's going to be
[1:15:15] that way and by the grace of God by the
[1:15:18] grace of God Jesus Christ is our he is
[1:15:23] the Conqueror amen he is our Champion
[1:15:25] brother brandham said one
[1:15:27] time as our brother was was preaching
[1:15:30] brother brandham said that to truly have
[1:15:34] your prayers heard for someone
[1:15:37] else is to be able to enter into that
[1:15:41] person's suffering to be able to get
[1:15:45] down and to see and to feel that
[1:15:49] person's
[1:15:50] pain to put it in brother Ryan's words
[1:15:55] to be able to see from that brother or
[1:15:58] that sister's perspective and then when
[1:16:00] you can really enter into that suffering
[1:16:04] that is
[1:16:05] when you're able to get through to the
[1:16:08] Lord in prayer for that person brothers
[1:16:12] and sisters as as our brother was was
[1:16:14] speaking I
[1:16:15] was I was I I was so
[1:16:18] thankful
[1:16:21] that not
[1:16:22] only are we trying to to see other
[1:16:26] people's
[1:16:27] perspectives but Jesus Christ sees from
[1:16:30] our perspective and he mentioned
[1:16:32] Moses and brother brandom always said he
[1:16:35] said many many times he said how could
[1:16:37] Moses have a better idea than God
[1:16:40] had when he was saying Lord that you
[1:16:42] should go back on your judgment of the
[1:16:47] people and let me tell you something
[1:16:50] that was not Moses speaking that was not
[1:16:53] a man speaking right there was none
[1:16:56] other than the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:17:00] speaking through that
[1:17:02] prophet and making
[1:17:05] intercession is a foreshadow of what was
[1:17:08] coming when the man died on the
[1:17:11] cross and he gave God another
[1:17:14] perspective and instead of looking at me
[1:17:16] brother Joe instead of looking at
[1:17:19] you his perspective was looking at his
[1:17:22] perfect virgin born son of God
[1:17:25] and the perfectness of Jesus Christ is
[1:17:29] God's perspective on us brothers and
[1:17:32] sisters please take heed to what our
[1:17:34] brother
[1:17:35] said and look at things from other
[1:17:38] perspectives other than
[1:17:40] yourselves look in every situation when
[1:17:43] you get angry when you get frustrated
[1:17:45] look at someone else's
[1:17:48] perspective it's not always we don't
[1:17:50] always want to look through things
[1:17:51] through our eyes look through things
[1:17:54] from other people's eyes eyes and as a
[1:17:56] brother said Walk In Those Shoes brother
