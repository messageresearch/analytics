[33:26] opportunity

[34:23] in the name of your son Jesus Christ
[34:29] let's remain standing and let's
[34:31] turn to the book of Philippians chapter
[34:35] 4.

[34:49] of my heart
[34:50] God bless you for using your talent to
[34:53] glorify our Lord
[34:56] Philippians chapter seven I'm sorry
[34:58] Philippians chapter 4 verse 7.
[35:02] and the peace of God
[35:05] which passeth all understanding shall
[35:07] keep your hearts and Minds through
[35:09] Christ Jesus
[35:12] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[35:14] true
[35:15] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[35:18] things are just whatsoever things are
[35:21] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[35:23] whatsoever things are of good report if
[35:26] there be any virtue and if there be any
[35:28] praise think on these things
[35:31] those things which you have both learned
[35:33] and received and heard and seen in me do
[35:39] in the God of Peace shall be with you
[35:42] amen you can take your seeds
[35:45] what a testimony that the Apostle Paul
[35:48] has
[35:50] that he could say those last words
[35:53] the things that you have both learned
[35:55] and received and heard and seen in me
[35:59] do
[36:01] I
[36:03] wow that's
[36:05] the Apostle Paul lifted himself up there
[36:07] he must have been living this life that
[36:10] we call Christianity
[36:11] it must have been serious about it
[36:14] I am
[36:16] he was a great man
[36:18] a little while one day I want to shake
[36:19] his hand
[36:20] say thank you for all that you've done
[36:23] we um appreciated brother Peter this
[36:25] morning he talked about talked about
[36:27] snakes
[36:29] and uh it's funny because it goes along
[36:32] I wanted to give a testimony
[36:34] to start out um
[36:36] I was uh I spent the past couple weeks
[36:39] not last week but weeks before that it
[36:41] was I was hunting
[36:43] and uh I was helping a guy that um
[36:49] he uh last time I helped him he killed
[36:52] an absolute monster bull elk and that
[36:55] was about 18 years ago and he got drawn
[36:58] again he said hey I heard you came back
[36:59] to Arizona
[37:00] he said would you want to point me in
[37:03] the right direction and and I love
[37:05] hunting I don't necessarily like killing
[37:07] the animals but I like going and I like
[37:09] you know helping other people
[37:11] so we went up there he's a Lutheran
[37:14] and uh a few people had called me or
[37:19] texted me and said hey I'm praying for
[37:21] you I believe the Lord's got something
[37:23] special
[37:24] and um so I had I high expectations and
[37:28] we went along our hunts and um
[37:31] he uh he asked me he says um
[37:34] what uh what do you hope to accomplish
[37:36] in your ministry what is your ministry
[37:39] about
[37:40] and I said well I said
[37:43] you know we have all these different
[37:44] churches we have all these different
[37:45] organizations and we have all this
[37:47] Division and I said the main thing and I
[37:50] think it comes back to the Bible the
[37:53] main thing is that we could encourage a
[37:57] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[37:59] I know that sounds cliche
[38:02] because pretty much every Church would
[38:04] say that
[38:05] but that is the main thing
[38:08] is that we can encourage people to have
[38:10] this relationship not with a priest
[38:13] but with Christ
[38:15] and I asked him
[38:17] I said
[38:18] your religion and he wasn't really
[38:21] practicing Lutheran but I said your
[38:24] religion is based on a man that died 500
[38:26] years ago
[38:28] I said uh where is Martin Luther today
[38:32] I said where is that man
[38:34] that struggled that thought with the
[38:38] devil all night long as Martin Luther
[38:41] did I said where's Martin Luther today
[38:44] I said where is that Martin Luther
[38:47] that stood up against the tyranny
[38:50] of the Catholic Church the murderous
[38:53] nature of the church
[38:55] and took
[38:57] 95 reasons why the Catholic church is
[39:01] wrong and nailed them to the church door
[39:04] I said where is Martin Luther today
[39:08] we talked
[39:09] about it and um
[39:12] I got to thinking
[39:14] that's a good question to ask myself
[39:18] there is there should be Martin Luther's
[39:20] today
[39:20] there should be John Wesley's today
[39:22] there should be William branham's today
[39:25] among the people real Christians
[39:30] and so he was I was I was expecting
[39:33] something brother Aaron and I didn't I
[39:35] didn't know what it was so
[39:37] I uh we finished
[39:39] he uh he had a wonderfully successful
[39:41] hunt he ended up he was very much a
[39:43] perfectionist he ended up not killing
[39:45] one but um he didn't want to kill a
[39:47] little one so so everything was good in
[39:50] the world so I drive home I get home
[39:52] late
[39:54] um
[39:55] on Thursday night
[39:57] and uh it was I don't know midnight
[40:02] if it's dark out
[40:04] so
[40:05] I park my truck where I always park it
[40:09] doesn't matter if you could put that
[40:09] first picture up of the two vehicles
[40:11] there I parked my my truck where I
[40:13] usually park right here yeah right there
[40:16] and uh you can see there's about three
[40:18] feet
[40:19] between between the two bumpers there
[40:21] and
[40:23] so I I got out I got my stuff out I
[40:26] closed the door when you close the door
[40:27] the lights go off
[40:29] and
[40:31] I was walking around the truck
[40:34] and just the fog lights are on and I
[40:36] couldn't see anything
[40:37] and I was walking around the truck
[40:41] and immediately something happened
[40:45] and it wasn't like something spoke to me
[40:49] I knew what was going on
[40:53] I
[40:55] took my foot back I jumped back and I
[40:58] knew that there was a coiled up
[41:00] rattlesnake right on my next step if you
[41:04] could go to the next slide I took a
[41:06] picture of you can't see it can you
[41:07] that's when I turned on the lights
[41:09] of the vehicle
[41:12] and
[41:13] I jumped back and it was the strangest
[41:16] feeling
[41:17] I don't know if it was a involuntary
[41:20] defense response that's in in the human
[41:22] brain but I felt on the bottom of my
[41:26] foot I felt that snake underneath my
[41:29] foot I didn't step on it
[41:31] but I felt it I jumped back
[41:35] and and you know it's like whoa you know
[41:37] this that was that was real I went I
[41:39] turned my lights on and I see the guy
[41:41] you see him right there in the middle of
[41:43] the picture
[41:44] you know obviously my blood pressure was
[41:46] up I'm looking at the thing and there's
[41:48] this giant snake I mean it's like this
[41:50] big
[41:51] seemed that big maybe it wasn't that big
[41:53] but it was big and that fangs you know
[41:57] big fangs
[41:59] and and uh so I jumped back in and I've
[42:02] been around snakes my whole life I grew
[42:04] up in Tucson and I've never really been
[42:06] afraid of them you know brother Peter
[42:08] was saying how much he hates him I
[42:09] didn't care Stephanie's always yelling
[42:11] at me for picking up the the harmless
[42:13] ones and and I don't like them it's not
[42:15] like I have pet snakes or anything but
[42:17] Peter but I don't I don't mind them I
[42:19] like nature
[42:22] um so I wasn't really scared of it but I
[42:25] I saw what had happened
[42:27] there and I knew
[42:29] that God had protected me
[42:31] and I want to give him glory for that
[42:34] brother Peter asked the question
[42:37] he said he said this morning he says
[42:39] well what do you do with your snakes if
[42:40] you go to the next slide he uh he didn't
[42:43] make it
[42:44] but that was him the next day
[42:47] and uh yeah he got the bad end of
[42:50] Stephanie's broom
[42:52] um but uh yeah there he was
[42:56] right there coiled up there is no way I
[43:00] could have walked between those two
[43:02] vehicles without stepping on that snake
[43:05] God protected me
[43:07] and he is always there friends even I
[43:10] brought you know I wouldn't have killed
[43:11] me but it would have been a very in much
[43:14] of an inconvenience to get bitten by
[43:17] that thing
[43:18] but I want to give God the praise and I
[43:21] think it was it was a good timing from
[43:24] what Peter said this morning to give
[43:26] that testimony I'm grateful
[43:29] thank you brother Matt
[43:31] um
[43:32] and another thing that happened is
[43:34] brother Morrow when he was praying this
[43:35] morning
[43:36] he he prayed that his wife
[43:39] he was thanking the Lord that his wife
[43:41] had found her ring
[43:43] and I thought you know it'd be a good
[43:45] time to give this testimony to
[43:47] a few months about a month ago
[43:52] Robert fritzinger y'all probably know
[43:54] the fritzinger family Robert fritzinger
[43:58] um called me he he works he works for me
[44:01] I'm a supervisor
[44:03] um and uh he called and he was back in
[44:06] Indiana and I feel bad for Robert
[44:10] before I left Tucson I was Robert's boss
[44:14] and then I come back to Tucson and I'm
[44:16] still his boss poor guy can't win for
[44:18] losing but but he was in Jeffersonville
[44:21] he was in Indiana and he called me and
[44:23] he says hey he says Nana um
[44:26] I uh would it be okay if I had a couple
[44:29] more days off he said he said my wife
[44:32] she lost the diamond out of her ring
[44:36] and he said we just we want to go back
[44:38] and look for it and I said I said yeah
[44:40] sure I said um
[44:42] where's uh you know where'd you lose it
[44:44] she said he says well it's really bad he
[44:47] says we're at the lake
[44:49] all day
[44:51] and he said you know if we were in the
[44:54] boat she had her hands over hanging off
[44:56] in the water as the water was rushing by
[44:58] in the boat you know she she was on the
[45:00] dock
[45:01] she was at the playground she was and
[45:03] he's like I just I just want to look a
[45:05] little bit more
[45:07] and um I said sure and he said would you
[45:10] pray you know that we find it I said
[45:12] absolutely and I have to admit
[45:15] my faith wasn't what it should have been
[45:18] there was no way to find that diamond
[45:22] out of that ring
[45:24] Robert was
[45:25] he was a little upset and he said he's
[45:27] he said he's got four kids he said the
[45:30] kids were just crying
[45:32] they were so hurt that mom had lost her
[45:36] diamond and Robert you know this is this
[45:39] is he told me he says this is the union
[45:41] this is the token of the Union between
[45:43] me and my wife he says I wanted to find
[45:45] it
[45:46] so I have to admit that my faith wasn't
[45:49] I asked the Lord
[45:51] but my faith wasn't where it should have
[45:53] been
[45:54] but his children
[45:57] were praying earnestly
[46:00] and sometimes
[46:02] when we pray for people
[46:04] the reason that Jesus's prayer meant so
[46:08] much
[46:09] the Bible says that he is a high priest
[46:12] that can be touched by the feeling of
[46:14] our infirmities
[46:15] Jesus went through it
[46:18] whatever we're suffering with whatever's
[46:21] hindering us whatever temptation's there
[46:24] whatever sickness is there Jesus
[46:26] experienced it he was God made flesh
[46:29] he's been through it
[46:31] so he's someone that we can touch and
[46:33] these these kids I had a burden for
[46:35] their mom
[46:37] they were crying and they're like Lord
[46:39] Jesus and they were praying and there's
[46:41] a Lord give mom back her diamond
[46:44] they looked all day long they looked in
[46:48] the bathrooms they looked on the
[46:50] playgrounds they looked on the beach
[46:52] they looked everywhere that they could
[46:55] find that they could think of they
[46:56] looked couldn't find it obviously they
[46:59] couldn't find it
[47:00] she had her hand in the water you know
[47:02] it was probably at the bottom of the
[47:04] lake
[47:05] so they they went after that they went
[47:08] to Subway
[47:09] and uh that night and and couldn't find
[47:12] it there so Robert called me and said
[47:13] hey can I have another day I said yes
[47:15] they go back and they look again
[47:18] all day for a diamond
[47:21] a little tiny Stone
[47:24] it looked all day
[47:27] it started getting dark and it got dark
[47:30] Robert's wife's name is Kika
[47:33] they had flashlights and they said well
[47:35] let's go let's go over to the um
[47:38] let's go over the playground and sad the
[47:41] kids were just so upset
[47:43] go to the playground and Kika they had
[47:45] the flashlights and and they're looking
[47:47] and Kika shines it over
[47:51] there
[47:53] there was a little Sparkle
[47:57] she gets up closer there's a leaf laying
[48:00] on the ground and underneath that leaf
[48:02] was a sparkle
[48:05] she she walked up she picked up the leaf
[48:08] and there was the little diamond
[48:11] a miracle that God did
[48:16] and we we think about these children
[48:18] imagine how that increased the faith of
[48:21] the children
[48:22] brother Matt can you play that for me
[48:27] this is this is Robert's oldest son
[48:40] where where
[48:42] she would find it and
[48:46] I believed in him and it happened so
[48:50] that means god is real hey man
[48:57] I asked him to put it
[49:00] to put her Stone where she can find it
[49:02] and I also asked him to put where my to
[49:07] put my name to Lori in and wake up where
[49:10] I can find it
[49:12] me
[49:13] and that happened and and since we know
[49:17] what he made that means he's real he's
[49:20] absolutely real wonderful amen isn't
[49:24] that wonderful
[49:27] I I could preach for a month and I
[49:29] couldn't say it like that kid just said
[49:30] it he is real and he cares it was
[49:34] impossible for that diamond to be found
[49:37] but he heard the prayer of this little
[49:41] kid
[49:42] of these children they had a burden
[49:45] friends they had a burden for their mom
[49:49] and the Lord stepped on the scene and
[49:51] when we pray for each other
[49:54] that's why we enter into that suffering
[49:56] with whoever we're praying for
[49:59] and there was there was a time that
[50:01] back in the 50s there was a prayer line
[50:03] that that was that came up
[50:06] and uh but the Branham was standing
[50:09] there
[50:10] and this woman with a baby came up
[50:13] before him
[50:15] and brother Branham he had a gift
[50:18] that he could tell the very secrets of
[50:23] the heart
[50:24] and as people were coming up he would
[50:26] discern this is what's wrong with you
[50:28] this is this is where you're struggling
[50:30] this is where you live this is this is
[50:32] whatever it is this woman came up
[50:35] she had the baby and he said sister he
[50:38] says your baby is not sick
[50:42] and she said okay he said there was a
[50:46] woman over here
[50:49] that saw your sick baby
[50:52] and she was a mother
[50:55] and she had a burden for that child
[50:58] and she came up and asked you sister can
[51:02] I pray for that child I know that you're
[51:04] you're in the prayer line and I know
[51:06] brother branham's a wonderful man but
[51:08] but can I pray for her just before you
[51:11] go up there can I pray for your child
[51:14] he said of course
[51:15] and she was even embarrassed to pray for
[51:17] her because of where she was at
[51:20] but
[51:21] she prayed for the baby
[51:24] because she had that burden
[51:27] because she had that love because she
[51:28] entered into that suffering because she
[51:30] was a mother
[51:31] that baby was healed
[51:33] right there and then when it came
[51:35] through the line there was nothing wrong
[51:36] with it so as we pray we need to
[51:39] remember
[51:40] enter into that suffering of that person
[51:44] I think three is perfection I got a
[51:48] letter from um
[51:50] I uh when I first when I first moved to
[51:53] Tucson I thought Lord what can I do
[51:55] how can I help the body
[51:58] and I noticed that there were some some
[52:00] of the uh Brethren that were in prison
[52:03] from the different churches and I said
[52:04] well maybe I can write them letters
[52:06] encourage them I know how much it means
[52:09] for an inmate to receive a letter
[52:11] that's that's golden somebody out there
[52:14] cares about me they're stuck there don't
[52:16] forget them
[52:18] they're there and
[52:19] we know that there has been great men
[52:21] that had been prison Paul was one of
[52:22] them and this Philippians letter was
[52:24] written while he was in prison
[52:27] so
[52:28] I started writing
[52:31] um these Brethren and
[52:33] one of the brothers gave me a testimony
[52:35] and I just got the letter
[52:38] um I read it a couple a couple days ago
[52:41] and he gave a testimony
[52:44] there was a man named Dustin
[52:47] and this brother is teaching a Bible
[52:49] study inside a prison he's doing
[52:52] everything that he can
[52:53] to lead lead souls to Christ so he's
[52:57] he's teaching this Bible study in this
[53:00] this Justin Justin is from the Aryan
[53:02] Brotherhood
[53:04] rough white guys so
[53:07] Justin is married and Justin made his
[53:11] wife
[53:12] a ring
[53:13] in prison he had access to some of the
[53:15] tools and some of the scrap metal and it
[53:18] was a big No-No but he made his wife a
[53:21] ring because he loved her and he wanted
[53:23] to be able to give her something
[53:25] so he made this ring
[53:27] and he got it finished
[53:29] and he lost it
[53:32] he lost it during their work day
[53:34] so
[53:36] they're looking around and the brother
[53:38] said that they had swept the floor in
[53:40] the whole area they'd swept it twice
[53:42] they couldn't find the ring
[53:45] so so this brother's walking by and he's
[53:48] going he finishes his shift he's walking
[53:49] by he says what do you all do and he
[53:51] says we lost we lost a ring he said we
[53:53] can't let the guards find it we'll get
[53:54] in trouble and the brothers you know and
[53:56] the man he spent long time making this
[53:57] for his wife so so the brother started
[54:00] looking and the guards walked by and
[54:02] they're like yeah we're not doing
[54:03] anything just looking just sweeping so
[54:07] the uh the brother
[54:10] says to the Aryan Brotherhood Justin
[54:14] he says you know what we haven't done
[54:18] he said we haven't prayed
[54:21] so they got together let me read to you
[54:22] what this brother said what this brother
[54:24] wrote in his
[54:25] his letter
[54:27] he prayed this
[54:29] if he places such importance on those
[54:32] little items
[54:34] then would he have the value of this man
[54:36] and what this little ring means to him
[54:39] then when he valued the heart of this
[54:42] man and what this little ring means to
[54:43] him
[54:45] so he was asking the Lord
[54:48] and he says this
[54:50] said amen
[54:52] and this brother has issued a flashlight
[54:56] he said
[54:58] I turned on the flashlight after we
[55:00] prayed I lowered it down to the floor
[55:02] and turned it on and there four inches
[55:04] from my right foot was the ring
[55:07] they found it
[55:10] so he was sharing that testimony with
[55:12] another person in his bible study this
[55:16] guy's name was Spike you never would
[55:18] have guessed that
[55:19] so he is sharing this testimony about
[55:22] this man named Spike about uh this this
[55:25] Justin and the ring and he says
[55:28] he says uh
[55:29] uh Spike tells this brother he says hey
[55:33] he says um
[55:35] I'm about to be released to a halfway
[55:37] house
[55:39] and he says I'm about to be delayed
[55:42] because I owe 25 in fees
[55:46] and he says I have no way to pay that
[55:51] so this brother says well
[55:53] what do you want to do and he said well
[55:55] you prayed about the ring he says can
[55:57] you pray about the 25 dollars he says
[56:00] yeah
[56:02] so he prays
[56:03] about the 25 dollars
[56:06] and then the next morning
[56:09] when he's scheduled to be released
[56:12] they found out that that same day the
[56:16] previous day someone had paid the 25
[56:18] dollars
[56:21] how much Faith did that raise same as
[56:24] this this boy how much Faith did that
[56:26] raise and spikes are so now he's out and
[56:29] I wonder if he's remembering that
[56:31] testimony
[56:33] it's a
[56:34] I've been uh Stephanie and merely were
[56:37] talking about this lady Corey ten Boom
[56:40] so I started reading about her she's the
[56:42] one that hid all the Jews and and uh I
[56:46] mean a tremendous testimony and she
[56:47] actually
[56:49] what what she did is
[56:52] there was a Judas among them
[56:55] and they told her they said hey this
[56:57] man's coming and he'll turn you in and
[56:59] she says I don't want to know who he is
[57:01] got to protect me
[57:03] so she wouldn't turn this man in
[57:06] and it ends up that that was the man
[57:08] that came in
[57:10] and
[57:12] told on this family
[57:15] and they are all imprisoned
[57:17] after that she has a tremendous
[57:19] testimony but she said this and I
[57:21] thought
[57:21] I thought it was really nice that in
[57:24] thinking about this diamond and thinking
[57:26] about these rings
[57:27] Corey ten boom says this she says let
[57:30] God's promises shine on your problems
[57:33] uh just that blessed me so much
[57:36] I am
[57:38] our God is real as a little brother said
[57:41] it he is absolutely a wonderful God he
[57:46] anointed a man two thousand years ago
[57:48] named Paul
[57:49] to write the biggest part
[57:53] of this new testament
[57:55] Paul had a style of writing
[57:58] that it was very interesting Paul would
[58:02] he he would write a letter
[58:04] and the first part of his letter
[58:08] he would bring correction
[58:11] he would bring instruction now Paul's
[58:14] writings weren't all butterflies and
[58:16] daisies
[58:17] there was a lot of Correction associated
[58:20] with Paul's writings but then he would
[58:22] get to a certain point
[58:24] and then he would say now here's what
[58:26] you do with it
[58:28] and in all of Paul's writings he really
[58:31] showed that there was a relationship
[58:33] between knowing what to do and doing it
[58:38] uh this morning sister Elizabeth came to
[58:41] she came up in the prayer line and I
[58:43] asked her if this was okay and she gave
[58:45] me permission
[58:47] she came up in the prayer line and she
[58:49] wanted us to pray about something that
[58:51] she said she was struggling with and
[58:53] it's something that probably eight out
[58:55] of 10 of us here struggle with and she
[58:59] was spending too much time on social
[59:01] media she was spending too much time on
[59:04] I call it the little square Idol or
[59:06] whatever it is and she said that she
[59:09] made this statement she said I should be
[59:11] the most holy one in this church
[59:13] because of the time that I have
[59:16] and and and then she came up and and we
[59:21] prayed for her and I thought that's
[59:22] exactly what Paul taught
[59:26] identify it
[59:28] and then do something about it and
[59:31] that's what our sister did this morning
[59:33] and I'll tell you what when you make
[59:35] that first step the first step's the
[59:37] hardest when you make that first step
[59:40] Lord I want to change I want to give a
[59:44] little bit more of myself as the song
[59:46] says I give myself away I want to give a
[59:49] little bit more of myself away I'm going
[59:51] to make that stuff and he will honor it
[59:54] he sees it don't ever think that he
[59:57] doesn't see it even when we fail
[59:59] he sees it
[1:00:01] he knows our intentions and he knows our
[1:00:04] efforts and I told the sisters this
[1:00:06] morning I said he won't tempt you any
[1:00:07] with anything more than you can't
[1:00:09] overcome yourself
[1:00:11] that's in his word
[1:00:13] so Paul in in the Book of Romans he
[1:00:15] gives correction the first 11 chapters
[1:00:19] of Romans Paul gives instructions on
[1:00:22] what to do and then in Romans 12 chapter
[1:00:26] 1 he says this he says now therefore
[1:00:28] make your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:00:31] and in Ephesians he does the same thing
[1:00:35] he goes in the first three chapters and
[1:00:38] then when he hits the fourth chapter he
[1:00:39] said I therefore a prisoner of the Lord
[1:00:42] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:00:44] vocation we're with you called
[1:00:47] so Paul has a style of writing here
[1:00:51] First Corinthians
[1:00:53] he brings correction to this Corinthian
[1:00:57] Church he said you're all divided
[1:01:01] he said you're fighting he says and you
[1:01:04] know what you're doing you're taking
[1:01:05] sides
[1:01:06] in the church
[1:01:08] he says this one over here he says every
[1:01:10] one of you
[1:01:12] is saying I'm of Paul
[1:01:14] I am of Peter
[1:01:17] cephas
[1:01:18] I'm of Apollos and then this one over
[1:01:21] here says I'm of Christ
[1:01:24] and he says was Paul baptized were you
[1:01:28] baptized in the name of Paul
[1:01:30] did Paul die on the cross for you
[1:01:34] why are we not
[1:01:37] putting Christ first
[1:01:39] and you see it that is a problem in
[1:01:42] Christianity around the world
[1:01:44] and you see all the different divisions
[1:01:46] and all that but there's a prophecy that
[1:01:49] Jesus prayed that everything will come
[1:01:52] together
[1:01:53] I just pray there's going to be a lot
[1:01:55] that doesn't come together that are left
[1:01:57] out but I want to be part of the coming
[1:01:59] together
[1:02:01] let's turn
[1:02:02] to Philippians
[1:02:06] this is a prison epistle which means
[1:02:09] Paul wrote this from prison
[1:02:16] let's let's start with verse 4.
[1:02:19] Paul says this
[1:02:23] Philippians chapter 4 verse 4.
[1:02:27] rejoice in the lord always and again I
[1:02:30] say rejoice
[1:02:33] let your moderation be known unto all
[1:02:35] men
[1:02:36] the Lord is at hand the word moderation
[1:02:39] Modern English and other translations it
[1:02:42] means gentleness
[1:02:45] be careful for nothing
[1:02:47] again modern translation he says don't
[1:02:50] be anxious
[1:02:51] be careful for nothing but in everything
[1:02:54] by prayer and supplication with
[1:02:56] Thanksgiving let your requests be known
[1:02:58] unto God
[1:03:00] and the peace of God which passeth all
[1:03:02] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:03:04] Minds through Christ Jesus
[1:03:07] finally brethren
[1:03:09] whatsoever I just love reading this by
[1:03:11] the way I wanna read it loud
[1:03:14] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[1:03:16] true
[1:03:17] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:03:19] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:03:21] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:03:22] whatsoever things are of good report
[1:03:28] if there be any virtue and if there be
[1:03:31] any praise
[1:03:33] think
[1:03:34] on these things
[1:03:38] that's
[1:03:39] statement don't just read past it I'll
[1:03:42] say oh I should keep this stuff on my
[1:03:44] mind
[1:03:45] what Paul is saying when he says think
[1:03:48] on these things that's in a very very
[1:03:51] important statement
[1:03:53] in fact I think it's more important than
[1:03:55] what he said before
[1:03:57] because our thoughts brother Joe is Who
[1:04:00] We Are
[1:04:02] what we're thinking of defines us
[1:04:07] Proverbs 23 7 says for as he thinketh in
[1:04:11] his heart so is he
[1:04:14] so our thoughts are exactly Who We Are
[1:04:19] let's turn to Matthew chapter 15 keep
[1:04:22] we're going to go through that that
[1:04:24] whole chapter of Philippians so keep
[1:04:26] Philippians marked there but let's turn
[1:04:28] to Matthew chapter 15.
[1:04:32] verse 7. now Jesus is being accused of
[1:04:35] not doing the ceremonial
[1:04:37] hand washing
[1:04:39] and uh
[1:04:41] you know they're looking for something
[1:04:42] to criticize him for
[1:04:44] Jesus responds by saying this verse 7.
[1:04:48] you hypocrites
[1:04:50] well did it say as the prophet well did
[1:04:53] it says prophesy of you saying this
[1:04:55] people drawth nigh unto me with their
[1:04:56] mouth and on Earth me with their lips
[1:04:58] but their heart is far from me
[1:05:01] but in vain do they worship me teaching
[1:05:03] for doctrines the Commandments of men
[1:05:05] talking about not only about hand
[1:05:07] washing but there's a lot of things
[1:05:12] and he and he called the multitude and
[1:05:14] said unto them hear and understand
[1:05:16] not that which goeth into the mouth
[1:05:19] defileth a man
[1:05:21] but that which cometh out of the man of
[1:05:25] the mouth defileth a man
[1:05:28] then the disciples came said unto him
[1:05:31] knowest thou that the Pharisees were
[1:05:33] offended after they heard the saying
[1:05:36] like whoa
[1:05:39] this made them mad
[1:05:43] but he answered and said every plant
[1:05:44] which my heavenly father hath not plant
[1:05:46] shall be rooted up
[1:05:48] let them alone
[1:05:50] they be blind leaders of the Blind and
[1:05:53] if the blind lead the blind both shall
[1:05:56] fall into the ditch sometimes
[1:05:59] you know Jesus says leave them alone
[1:06:02] I know a lot of us sometimes feel the
[1:06:03] same way
[1:06:05] then answered Peter and said unto him
[1:06:06] declare unto this this Parable what does
[1:06:09] this mean and Jesus said are ye also yet
[1:06:12] without understanding
[1:06:14] do not ye yet understand that whatsoever
[1:06:17] enter in at the mouth goes into the
[1:06:20] belly and is cast out into the draft but
[1:06:22] those things which proceed out of the
[1:06:25] mouth come forth from the heart
[1:06:29] and they defile the man
[1:06:33] so these things that are said that come
[1:06:36] out of our mouth that's what we're
[1:06:38] thinking
[1:06:39] and as Proverbs as I said for he that
[1:06:42] for as he thinketh in his heart
[1:06:45] so is he
[1:06:47] so it's these thoughts friends they they
[1:06:49] Define us
[1:06:51] and so often
[1:06:54] the way that that we live our lives the
[1:06:56] way that we handle things is we might
[1:06:59] scheme a little bit
[1:07:01] and we might think well if I do this
[1:07:04] then this person will do that
[1:07:08] it never works
[1:07:09] because that is what you would do
[1:07:13] if you were put in the same situation
[1:07:15] so if we're thinking about if we're
[1:07:16] always thinking about well this person's
[1:07:18] talking about me or that person's
[1:07:20] talking about this person's running me
[1:07:21] down
[1:07:22] maybe that's what you're doing
[1:07:25] maybe that is what's being come what's
[1:07:28] coming out of your mouth
[1:07:30] and you're worried about everybody else
[1:07:32] doing it
[1:07:33] be careful always check your thoughts
[1:07:37] think on these things
[1:07:40] our thoughts Are Who We Are
[1:07:42] so if we're always thinking somebody's
[1:07:45] trying to cheat me somebody's trying to
[1:07:46] do me wrong somebody's
[1:07:49] after me maybe it's not so much even
[1:07:51] that
[1:07:53] maybe it's that well that's probably
[1:07:55] what I would do if I was in that
[1:07:56] situation
[1:07:58] so examine yourself
[1:08:01] as the Bible says
[1:08:03] and um
[1:08:06] brother Brown says this
[1:08:10] that's a little quote and I love it I
[1:08:12] didn't give it to the brother but it
[1:08:13] says this
[1:08:14] a lie is the truth misused
[1:08:20] a lie is the truth misused so he can
[1:08:23] take something that's that's pretty much
[1:08:24] true and then you can twist it
[1:08:28] and make it into something
[1:08:29] that's destructive
[1:08:31] or something against and use it use it
[1:08:34] for something that's maybe a little
[1:08:36] nefarious in in the intents
[1:08:39] and it's just it gets disappointing
[1:08:43] and
[1:08:45] let me let me read you something
[1:08:47] my brother Branham said
[1:08:49] when I read this a
[1:08:52] I thought wow we have arrived
[1:08:55] brother if you put up that quote the
[1:08:57] trouble of it
[1:08:59] we go to church and sing to him and the
[1:09:02] pastor talks about the roses and the
[1:09:04] flowers and we go back home oh my that's
[1:09:07] the reason we don't get nowhere
[1:09:09] that's what's the matter with our
[1:09:10] Pentecostal churches now I never come
[1:09:13] here to Pat you on the back I come here
[1:09:14] to tell you the truth
[1:09:16] see in all the Pentecostal churches went
[1:09:18] on a building Rampage it's went on a
[1:09:20] denominational Rampage it's gone
[1:09:22] everywhere and cut and divided and
[1:09:23] pulled out and separated and segregated
[1:09:27] you know it's going to have this is
[1:09:30] going to be the biggest and that's going
[1:09:32] to be the biggest as long as you do that
[1:09:34] she'll never go nowhere
[1:09:36] remember I tell you in the name of the
[1:09:38] Lord but when you'll come together oh my
[1:09:41] that's it when you'll fully obey God
[1:09:44] this will all men know you're my
[1:09:46] disciples when you have love one for the
[1:09:49] other
[1:09:50] when you get part
[1:09:53] of the theology out
[1:09:56] and get a little love in there it'll do
[1:09:59] works and wonders and miracles
[1:10:01] but we have got to do that
[1:10:07] we have got to have that
[1:10:10] for who for everybody now here's what
[1:10:14] I'm getting to
[1:10:15] oh for that whole bunch of Assemblies of
[1:10:17] God
[1:10:18] or that whole bunch of Church of God or
[1:10:20] old Oneness or threeness or fineness or
[1:10:22] whatever they got me love them I
[1:10:25] couldn't love them they're Antichrist
[1:10:30] have you ever heard that
[1:10:32] he's talking about denominations here
[1:10:36] oh we're better than they are
[1:10:39] they're Antichrist they're mark of the
[1:10:41] beast they're all these things
[1:10:43] but what's the the one that we listen to
[1:10:46] the one that we follow
[1:10:49] he says this
[1:10:52] you're lost yourself brother when you
[1:10:55] think that
[1:10:56] that's a strong statement
[1:10:59] his pay grade's a little higher than
[1:11:01] mine
[1:11:02] so I can quote him
[1:11:04] that's right you're not right with God
[1:11:07] if you can't raise out a hand to the
[1:11:10] bitterest enemy you God and try to win
[1:11:12] him to Christ and the spirit of Christ
[1:11:14] isn't in you
[1:11:16] for he come he come to his own his own
[1:11:18] received him not yet he gave his life
[1:11:20] for his enemy he did how true is it and
[1:11:24] that spirit of God in you makes you feel
[1:11:26] the same way about everybody
[1:11:29] when you get to a place now you can't
[1:11:31] just act it the devil knows whether
[1:11:33] you're acting or not
[1:11:35] and friends I say the same thing
[1:11:38] and
[1:11:39] I look at people and I I look at
[1:11:42] good people
[1:11:45] and how can we
[1:11:46] put them down
[1:11:48] we don't even know oh they go to this
[1:11:50] nominal Church they go to that church
[1:11:51] they they like this brother or that
[1:11:54] brother or or whatever it is and yet we
[1:11:57] say this person
[1:12:00] isn't it the elect
[1:12:02] I got a friend
[1:12:03] that uh he was um he contacted me today
[1:12:08] he's he's such a sweet brother he was in
[1:12:12] um a church in Jeffersonville
[1:12:16] and uh not associated with us
[1:12:19] and um
[1:12:21] he said brother the Lord just placed us
[1:12:24] together
[1:12:25] he said brother he said we thought we
[1:12:28] were the bride
[1:12:30] he saw he said we thought we were the
[1:12:33] elite
[1:12:34] we thought we were the elect
[1:12:39] let me tell you who the elite is it's
[1:12:41] those that believe in Jesus Christ
[1:12:44] and I can't separate that's up to God
[1:12:47] it was Christ that came in and separated
[1:12:49] the sheep from the goats
[1:12:51] not me
[1:12:52] I love my brothers I love my sisters
[1:12:55] but it's Jesus Christ that saves us
[1:13:01] oh yeah
[1:13:04] I have a friend some of you have met him
[1:13:07] we were he's the one we're up on Denali
[1:13:11] in Denali State uh National Park up
[1:13:13] there and uh I met that that Hindu girl
[1:13:16] and introduced her to the Lord Jesus I
[1:13:18] don't know if if um if you remember the
[1:13:20] testimony but um so we came down and
[1:13:24] this girl she was all excited and and
[1:13:26] she said well how do I get in touch with
[1:13:27] you so I had my my brother give give him
[1:13:30] give her his phone number
[1:13:32] and uh she might have been a weirdo you
[1:13:35] know
[1:13:36] she wasn't but but but so so my my
[1:13:41] friend gave her his phone number and uh
[1:13:44] by the way they've corresponded and uh
[1:13:47] she has some more questions
[1:13:49] and she wants to know how do I choose a
[1:13:51] church a Christian Church
[1:13:53] so it's been a blessing but I was
[1:13:55] talking with him
[1:13:57] um the other day and he's he's asking me
[1:13:59] he says brother he says he says that
[1:14:03] the the one of the churches that he
[1:14:06] knows of they've asked him and they're
[1:14:09] having problems with the the pastor and
[1:14:11] problems with with the people so so
[1:14:13] he'll ask me you know how do you how do
[1:14:15] you advise on these things and and I
[1:14:17] said brother you don't understand
[1:14:20] you have to put yourself
[1:14:23] in these people's positions
[1:14:26] and
[1:14:28] and I said you have to put yourself in
[1:14:30] the pastor's position in this and he
[1:14:32] says he says you know he says why don't
[1:14:34] they just do things that are right for
[1:14:36] the people
[1:14:37] he says why don't they just do things
[1:14:41] according to what is best for the people
[1:14:43] and I said brother you don't understand
[1:14:45] all of us are looking from different
[1:14:47] perspectives
[1:14:49] we may be looking at this this Hymnal
[1:14:51] right here and I might be seeing but I
[1:14:53] don't see anything here you might see
[1:14:55] all this you know that's what I've been
[1:14:57] looking at it's a different perspective
[1:14:59] but it's the same book and I said you
[1:15:01] have to have patience with him and he
[1:15:03] said
[1:15:04] he said this he says well why don't they
[1:15:06] just do
[1:15:07] what's right for the people if they know
[1:15:11] and
[1:15:12] and
[1:15:13] um
[1:15:14] I told him I said I said brother it's
[1:15:16] it's perspective
[1:15:19] and
[1:15:20] and you have to put yourself in that
[1:15:22] other person's position
[1:15:25] let's go to Matthew 15 19.
[1:15:28] for out of the heart
[1:15:31] precede evil thoughts murders adulterers
[1:15:33] fornications thefts fault false witness
[1:15:36] blasphemies
[1:15:38] again
[1:15:40] look at Proverbs 23 7. It lines up
[1:15:43] perfectly as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:15:44] and Jesus says here out of the heart
[1:15:46] proceed as evil so friends if we're
[1:15:49] always thinking about Sin
[1:15:51] if we're always thinking
[1:15:54] about evil thoughts if we're always
[1:15:56] thinking about crime or whatever it is
[1:15:58] whatever we're thinking about that's
[1:15:59] what we are
[1:16:03] Jesus says this he says these are things
[1:16:06] which defile a man
[1:16:08] but to eat with unwashing hands defile
[1:16:11] not a man
[1:16:13] so what they were doing there was
[1:16:14] accusing Jesus there's a there's a
[1:16:16] scripture
[1:16:17] that talks about when the the priests
[1:16:20] would come in to the sanctuary to the
[1:16:23] Tabernacle there was the lava there
[1:16:25] there was a big Basin for washing their
[1:16:27] hands they would wash their hands and
[1:16:29] then they would go in as a ceremonial
[1:16:31] washing and clean them and then make
[1:16:33] their sacrifice and do their Priestly
[1:16:34] work
[1:16:36] and it was so ingrained into this this
[1:16:40] Priestly
[1:16:42] um
[1:16:43] what do you call it uh
[1:16:46] something that they did ritual
[1:16:48] it became ingrained into the people
[1:16:51] so then
[1:16:52] the people started doing this for years
[1:16:56] and Moses set this in order so it was a
[1:16:58] long time so then we get down to Jesus's
[1:17:02] time and they're like hey you didn't
[1:17:04] wash your hands
[1:17:06] your your people didn't wash their hands
[1:17:11] this had become so much practiced and so
[1:17:15] much talked about but it wasn't even the
[1:17:18] message
[1:17:21] it wasn't something that the prophet
[1:17:23] taught
[1:17:25] but it was something that had been told
[1:17:26] over and over and over again
[1:17:30] but it wasn't actually something that
[1:17:33] pleased God it was just washing your
[1:17:36] hands
[1:17:38] Jesus says this
[1:17:41] let me read it again he says these are
[1:17:42] the things which defile a man but to eat
[1:17:44] with unwashing hands defileth not a man
[1:17:48] so they were condemning Moses or they
[1:17:51] were condemning Jesus for something that
[1:17:53] was just part of their own idea of the
[1:17:55] message and wasn't even real now for you
[1:17:58] you young mothers out there I'm not
[1:18:00] trying to usurp the moms and washing
[1:18:03] your hands before you eat as a little
[1:18:06] kids are saying Amen brother Dan
[1:18:08] foreign
[1:18:11] the fifth commandment honor thy father
[1:18:14] and thy mother
[1:18:16] and I think it was Paul that said that's
[1:18:18] the first commandment with promise to
[1:18:20] honor thy father and thy mother you
[1:18:22] don't wash your hands the promise is
[1:18:24] you're going to get
[1:18:26] a whooping
[1:18:29] but let's go back let's go back to
[1:18:31] Philippians
[1:18:33] Philippians chapter 4 verse 9.
[1:18:36] those things which you have learned and
[1:18:38] received and heard and seen in me do
[1:18:41] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[1:18:44] and I appreciate Paul's example Paul
[1:18:46] lived such a life that in Acts 19 that
[1:18:49] he was so pure that in Acts 19 they just
[1:18:53] took pieces of His Garment
[1:18:56] and they brought him to the and they
[1:18:58] distributed them to the people and just
[1:19:00] those pieces of those garments
[1:19:03] people got healed from them we call him
[1:19:05] a prayer cloth it was all the way back
[1:19:07] to the book of Acts and Paul
[1:19:09] where Paul they would take from from his
[1:19:11] garments and give them out
[1:19:15] and then people would get healed a
[1:19:17] friend of mine his name's David in in
[1:19:19] Jeffersonville
[1:19:20] he was witnessing in a place called I
[1:19:23] believe it was Salem Indiana
[1:19:25] and um he he talked to this this lady
[1:19:29] and he said have you ever heard of this
[1:19:31] man William Branham and and uh
[1:19:34] uh she said yes as a matter of fact I
[1:19:36] have
[1:19:38] and he says oh really well what do you
[1:19:40] know he says you know I always like to
[1:19:42] get stories and I believe his I think he
[1:19:44] was her it was either a grandmother or
[1:19:46] her mother I think it was her
[1:19:47] grandmother
[1:19:49] she was dying of cancer in the hospital
[1:19:52] and she was in a room and they had they
[1:19:55] had a curtain between the two rooms
[1:19:57] there was there was this lady and then
[1:19:59] there was another lady here a Christian
[1:20:01] and she had two friends and her two
[1:20:03] friends were praying for that she would
[1:20:05] be healed of cancer so they heard that
[1:20:09] brother Branham was going to have a
[1:20:10] meeting in Jeffersonville so they made
[1:20:12] the trip to Jeffersonville and they went
[1:20:15] into the service and brother Branham
[1:20:17] called them out and he says you're
[1:20:20] praying for your friend
[1:20:24] he said she has cancer he said take that
[1:20:27] handkerchief
[1:20:28] his prayer cloth
[1:20:31] and tell her to pin it under her garment
[1:20:34] and believe
[1:20:36] so they said okay so they take the the
[1:20:39] prayer cloth and they take it to their
[1:20:40] friend and and they say hey we went to
[1:20:43] the meetings and brother Brahm said this
[1:20:44] and if you take this prayer cloth and
[1:20:46] you put it under here according to the
[1:20:47] Bible then we believe you're going to
[1:20:49] get healed and she got embarrassed
[1:20:52] and she says well you know I don't
[1:20:54] really I don't want to do that you know
[1:20:55] it's kind of weird and they're like no
[1:20:57] no no no no no no no no he said that he
[1:20:59] called us out take this prayer cloth
[1:21:02] and put it on you
[1:21:05] and she said I don't
[1:21:06] I don't want to do that it's strange the
[1:21:09] girl on the other on the other side of
[1:21:11] the curtain she um if she doesn't want
[1:21:13] it I'll take it
[1:21:16] so she took the prayer cloth brother
[1:21:18] Arnie what do you think happened
[1:21:21] she lived to be an old lady
[1:21:24] walk down the hospital another woman
[1:21:26] died
[1:21:27] and then giving this testimony the lady
[1:21:31] told my friend he said she said he was
[1:21:32] as my mother or my grandmother so yes I
[1:21:34] do know this ministry
[1:21:37] we um
[1:21:39] look at Paul
[1:21:41] and the way that Paul lived his life
[1:21:45] um
[1:21:46] so much so that even
[1:21:50] he had this this way about him and
[1:21:53] friends you know what it was it was the
[1:21:55] Holy Spirit is what it is nothing they
[1:21:58] were different people Paul was different
[1:22:00] than Peter but Peter was so full of this
[1:22:03] love and so full of the spirit that
[1:22:05] Peter would just walked by someone and
[1:22:08] just his shadow just the shadow going
[1:22:10] across they'd be healed
[1:22:12] it's in the butt
[1:22:15] that is the kind of men and women these
[1:22:18] were in the Bible they had they had the
[1:22:21] spirit
[1:22:25] verse 10.
[1:22:27] but rejoice in the Lord greatly that now
[1:22:30] at the last your care of me hath
[1:22:32] flourished again wherein you are also
[1:22:34] careful but you lacked opportunity not
[1:22:36] that I speak with respect of want I have
[1:22:38] learned in whatsoever State I am
[1:22:42] wherewith therewith to be content
[1:22:46] I know both ought to be a based and I
[1:22:48] know how to abound
[1:22:50] everywhere and in all things I am
[1:22:52] instructed both to be full and to be
[1:22:54] hungry both to abound and to suffer
[1:22:58] look at Paul
[1:23:00] rejoicing in the situation that he was
[1:23:04] in in this case he was falsely
[1:23:05] imprisoned I'll read it really quickly
[1:23:07] we don't turn the Philippians chapter 1
[1:23:10] verse 12 Paul says this he says
[1:23:12] but I would ye should understand
[1:23:14] Brethren that the things which happen to
[1:23:16] me unto me
[1:23:18] have fallen out rather unto the
[1:23:21] furtherance of the Gospel so that my
[1:23:23] Bonds in Christ are manifested in all
[1:23:26] the palace and in other places and many
[1:23:29] of the brethren in the Lord waxing
[1:23:30] confident in my bonds are much more bold
[1:23:33] to speak the word without fear
[1:23:39] Paul is saying that I'm in prison
[1:23:43] but it's good
[1:23:45] this is benefiting the people
[1:23:47] if I'm in prison then there's others and
[1:23:50] they're going out and they're preaching
[1:23:52] and I'm preaching inside the prison look
[1:23:55] at Paul he wasn't looking at himself he
[1:23:57] was looking at the furtherance of the
[1:23:59] Gospel
[1:24:00] many of you are here
[1:24:02] um
[1:24:02] I preached a sermon
[1:24:05] on a Wednesday night
[1:24:07] and I preached a sermon on Philemon
[1:24:11] and um
[1:24:13] I talked about Philemon and how onesimus
[1:24:15] he had committed a crime and and he left
[1:24:18] and Philemon was was the owner his owner
[1:24:21] he was a slave Philemon
[1:24:24] it was a good man a Christian onesimus
[1:24:27] goes and he finds Paul in prison and he
[1:24:29] says hey
[1:24:30] I'm going to get crucified I'm going to
[1:24:32] get in trouble I don't know what to do
[1:24:34] Paul pins this letter
[1:24:36] called Philemon and made it into this
[1:24:39] book
[1:24:40] pins this letter called Philemon
[1:24:43] and says
[1:24:46] take this
[1:24:47] onesimus take this to Philemon
[1:24:50] announcements goes and he he takes it
[1:24:52] there and then I talked in the sermon I
[1:24:55] talked about the prison ministry and how
[1:24:59] people can leave the church they can get
[1:25:01] in trouble but always welcome them back
[1:25:04] in
[1:25:05] do you remember does anybody remember
[1:25:06] that service well
[1:25:09] what I didn't know
[1:25:11] when nobody else here knew
[1:25:14] is
[1:25:15] about three quarters of the way through
[1:25:18] the sermon I know brother Arne remembers
[1:25:21] about three quarters of the way through
[1:25:22] the sermon
[1:25:25] there's a man
[1:25:27] that used to attend this church
[1:25:31] and I don't know brother Arnie was he
[1:25:33] imprisoned you know
[1:25:35] Justin
[1:25:38] he looked like he was he uh had tattoos
[1:25:41] up to here and on his face and and uh
[1:25:43] but but anyways he came in
[1:25:46] and he heard
[1:25:48] some of that sermon
[1:25:50] and then it was Joseph I think it was
[1:25:52] you
[1:25:53] I met him outside and you came in the
[1:25:55] back
[1:25:56] and you said uh he said brother Daniel
[1:25:58] there's somebody outside that you need
[1:26:00] to talk to you remember
[1:26:02] and he was out there and I looked at him
[1:26:04] and and
[1:26:06] he uh
[1:26:09] he uh he said he's a brother he says I
[1:26:11] want to be baptized
[1:26:13] he says I used to attend this church
[1:26:15] and um I said okay remember brother he's
[1:26:19] up in the back and and I don't want to
[1:26:21] just
[1:26:22] and maybe I'm wrong in this but I don't
[1:26:24] want to just baptize somebody
[1:26:25] I want to know why they want to be
[1:26:27] baptized
[1:26:28] so I talked with him and I said I said
[1:26:30] brother I said and I talked about the
[1:26:33] eunuch and Philip I said that eunuch had
[1:26:34] to make a testimony that he believes in
[1:26:37] Jesus Christ
[1:26:39] and he said brother he says he says I do
[1:26:42] believe in Jesus Christ I need to be
[1:26:43] baptized and I said okay well do you
[1:26:45] want to wait until Sunday he said
[1:26:46] brother I need to be baptized right now
[1:26:48] okay
[1:26:50] so uh sister Shirley I think you were
[1:26:52] there a bunch of them piled back in to
[1:26:56] the congregation and when we baptized
[1:26:58] them up there
[1:27:00] and I don't know where he went
[1:27:02] but it was a it was just a tremendous
[1:27:05] testimony that he was listening there's
[1:27:09] somebody always listening to us
[1:27:11] I want to give a plug to brother Arnie
[1:27:14] back there you know brother Arnie is
[1:27:16] a good man
[1:27:17] been around the message for a long time
[1:27:19] I really believe brother Arnie has a
[1:27:22] calling and a gift
[1:27:23] to these people that come in
[1:27:26] you know I've listened to him I've stood
[1:27:28] next to him and I've listened to him
[1:27:30] talk to these people
[1:27:31] and he knows what to say he doesn't back
[1:27:34] down pat him on the back but he knows
[1:27:37] what to say it's a gift it's a it's a
[1:27:40] position in the church that's needed and
[1:27:43] I love I love it when I see a gift
[1:27:46] operate
[1:27:47] that's the brother Arnie I know you've
[1:27:48] got many other gifts but it's that's
[1:27:50] it's tremendous to me to see that one in
[1:27:53] operation
[1:27:55] where was I at
[1:27:58] um verse
[1:28:01] 12 right
[1:28:04] okay
[1:28:07] um
[1:28:07] I don't have time
[1:28:09] uh verse 13. I can do all things through
[1:28:12] Christ which strengtheneth me
[1:28:16] what a statement Paul here is he's
[1:28:19] saying he's saying all of these things
[1:28:21] that we have need of
[1:28:24] God can do
[1:28:27] there's a there's a a
[1:28:30] young lady she's in her mid-30s that um
[1:28:33] I I go to this gym she's the manager of
[1:28:37] the gym

[1:28:46] I just preach basically so I I get on
[1:28:51] the treadmill and somebody will come in

[1:29:24] obviously she says I always listen to
[1:29:25] your conversations she says would you
[1:29:28] pray for my daughter I said of course
[1:29:31] and um she said just just pray that uh
[1:29:34] you know my husband and I can make the
[1:29:36] right decisions and and um we had this
[1:29:39] we had this talk and about making the
[1:29:42] right decisions and I said

[1:29:47] a Christian she says yes I said Do you
[1:29:49] believe the Bible
[1:29:50] she says yes I said Do you believe Jesus
[1:29:52] Christ she says yes I said let me read
[1:29:55] you something that he wrote that he said
[1:29:58] and I grabbed my phone
[1:30:00] and I turned I'll do it right now I can
[1:30:03] quote it by heart but um
[1:30:05] turn to Mark chapter 16.
[1:30:09] and I said let me tell you what he wrote
[1:30:12] and I said I said you know what it is
[1:30:14] when the letters are in red right
[1:30:17] she said yes I said that's the Lord
[1:30:19] talking
[1:30:22] and he said unto them
[1:30:25] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:30:27] gospel to every creature
[1:30:29] he that believeth in is baptized shall
[1:30:31] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:30:33] be damned and these signs shall follow
[1:30:35] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:30:38] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:30:39] new tongues they shall take up serpents
[1:30:42] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[1:30:44] shall not hurt them
[1:30:46] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:30:49] they shall recover
[1:30:51] she said I've never been taught that I
[1:30:54] said well Jesus taught it
[1:30:56] she said
[1:30:57] she said well she said does that happen
[1:30:59] today
[1:31:01] I said let me give you a testimony I
[1:31:02] said I said when I was in the ministry
[1:31:05] back east
[1:31:07] there was a man that lived in England
[1:31:10] and he jumped he was diagnosed with
[1:31:13] Hepatitis
[1:31:14] he was a nurse
[1:31:16] so he couldn't perform
[1:31:20] his nursing job and he was going to get
[1:31:22] laid off because of the disease
[1:31:25] and you have family to support it's
[1:31:27] Congolese by birth I believe
[1:31:29] so he gets on a flight and he flies to
[1:31:33] Louisville
[1:31:35] and he shows up
[1:31:38] and he says I came here to be prayed for
[1:31:42] I have hepatitis
[1:31:45] and he says it's it's bad
[1:31:48] and I said well brother do you believe
[1:31:50] do you believe that God can heal
[1:31:52] and I told this this girl I said I read
[1:31:55] that same scripture to him that I read
[1:31:57] to you
[1:31:59] and um he said yes
[1:32:02] so I brought him into the chapel
[1:32:04] laid hands on him and we prayed
[1:32:08] and then
[1:32:10] he said can I stay for a little while
[1:32:12] longer
[1:32:14] and and he stayed I said sure I left and
[1:32:17] he stayed in the chapel and there's a
[1:32:19] there's a little altar like this where
[1:32:21] you can kneel down
[1:32:24] and he stayed there praying
[1:32:26] he made that whole trip
[1:32:28] from England
[1:32:30] to be prayed for
[1:32:32] so after a while the receptionist at the
[1:32:35] front I called down she said well he
[1:32:37] just left
[1:32:39] so he left went back home to England and
[1:32:41] I got an email
[1:32:44] and it showed me his hepatitis test
[1:32:47] before he left
[1:32:49] and then it showed me his hepatitis test
[1:32:51] when he got back
[1:32:53] negative
[1:32:55] no hepatitis
[1:32:58] and she said this girl named Loretto she
[1:33:01] said
[1:33:02] that happened she's like a chills
[1:33:05] she said that actually happened I said I
[1:33:06] saw it I was there Jesus healed this man
[1:33:11] she said you lay hands on him of course
[1:33:13] with what Jesus said I said yes it works
[1:33:17] it's alive today and it's real she said
[1:33:19] I gotta bring my daughter you got to lay
[1:33:21] hands on her I said bring her in
[1:33:23] we'll do it that just happened like two
[1:33:25] days ago
[1:33:26] let me tell you something I believe with
[1:33:28] all of my heart that God will heal that
[1:33:31] little girl
[1:33:32] why not why would I not believe that I
[1:33:35] believe it
[1:33:36] you watch one day she might give a
[1:33:39] little testimony up here just like this
[1:33:40] little guy did
[1:33:44] notwithstanding
[1:33:46] you have done well that you did
[1:33:48] communicate with my Affliction now you
[1:33:49] Philippians know also that in the
[1:33:51] beginning of the Gospel when I departed
[1:33:53] from Macedonia no church communicated
[1:33:55] with me as concerning giving and
[1:33:57] receiving but you only
[1:34:00] how Paul appreciated somebody thinking
[1:34:02] about it
[1:34:04] for even in thessalonica
[1:34:07] ye sent once and again to my necessity
[1:34:10] not because I desire a gift
[1:34:13] but I desire fruit that may abound to
[1:34:16] your account
[1:34:18] but I have all and abound I am full
[1:34:21] having received of epaphroditus the
[1:34:23] things which were sent from you and odor
[1:34:25] of sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable
[1:34:28] well-pleasing to God
[1:34:31] have you ever received
[1:34:33] a card
[1:34:34] or text from somebody
[1:34:38] that sin just you know just thinking
[1:34:40] about you just appreciate you doesn't
[1:34:43] that feel good
[1:34:44] that's exactly what Paul had here he
[1:34:46] says oh somebody cares about me
[1:34:49] that's how this is this scripture is
[1:34:51] think on these things
[1:34:53] that's what we need to do as Christians
[1:34:57] think about others
[1:34:59] you know I think about
[1:35:02] um
[1:35:04] think about uh
[1:35:06] think about my father-in-law Rod you
[1:35:09] know everybody knew rod
[1:35:10] you know Rod you know he's he's just a
[1:35:14] good guy he loved the baseball game and
[1:35:16] a hot dog you know he was he was just
[1:35:20] precious
[1:35:22] good friend good man
[1:35:25] but um Stephanie was talking with
[1:35:27] somebody one
[1:35:29] um
[1:35:30] not too long ago and she said I heard
[1:35:33] that your dad passed away
[1:35:35] and she said it made me sad
[1:35:38] she said because
[1:35:40] gave the impression
[1:35:42] that why he cared about me
[1:35:45] he thought about me
[1:35:47] and I thought Rod Carroll
[1:35:50] I thought what a man
[1:35:54] how many people were at his funeral this
[1:35:56] place was packed
[1:35:58] because of this man Rod this man of God
[1:36:03] and we think of you know this is how
[1:36:04] somebody should be or this is how
[1:36:06] somebody else should be look at the
[1:36:08] impression that this man
[1:36:10] made on all of these people Stephanie
[1:36:13] how many testimonies did we get from
[1:36:14] your dad saying how much they loved him
[1:36:17] I want that testimony
[1:36:19] and I want to I want people to say you
[1:36:21] know what brother Daniel cared about me
[1:36:23] brother Daniel thought about me
[1:36:26] and when when Stephanie told me that you
[1:36:29] know I thought
[1:36:31] God bless that man
[1:36:33] you know he's he he was he was a great
[1:36:36] man
[1:36:37] because of how he made others feel
[1:36:40] because he cared
[1:36:43] I am
[1:36:46] I gotta close I'm getting I'm getting
[1:36:50] to the end but um
[1:36:54] I
[1:36:55] was thinking about I used to ride my
[1:36:57] bike around the Jeffersonville area
[1:37:00] and I'd look for testimonies and
[1:37:03] miracles because that area of the
[1:37:04] country there were in the 50s and 60s
[1:37:07] there were more miracles there than
[1:37:09] there were anywhere else in the world
[1:37:11] so I get on my bike and I I'd ride and
[1:37:13] I'd look for old people sitting on their
[1:37:14] porch well I I rode up to um
[1:37:19] to this convenience store and it wasn't
[1:37:21] like a chain it was just a
[1:37:24] uh just a like a mom-and-pop shop
[1:37:27] and uh
[1:37:28] I went in and there was this old black
[1:37:30] man with this trucker hat on
[1:37:34] and I said um
[1:37:35] I said you ever hear a man named William
[1:37:37] Branham I'm doing some research on it
[1:37:40] and he said yes I do
[1:37:43] he had a uh his hat was a like a
[1:37:46] Teamsters hat
[1:37:48] he says yes I do
[1:37:50] and I said well tell me about him
[1:37:54] he said he cared for me
[1:37:57] he said when I was a little kid
[1:38:00] he said the blacks and the whites they
[1:38:01] were separate he says he says the whites
[1:38:03] they would never have have been seen
[1:38:05] with young with a little black kid in
[1:38:08] their car he said William Branham he
[1:38:11] said he always had to nicest car
[1:38:13] he said it was shined up and it was nice
[1:38:15] he said he would drive and he would pick
[1:38:18] me up
[1:38:20] and drive me to school
[1:38:23] and he said I thought I was big stuff
[1:38:26] getting out of that car
[1:38:29] made that impression
[1:38:31] on this this man
[1:38:34] made that impression so far to where as
[1:38:37] an old man he still remembers
[1:38:39] how much this man meant to him
[1:38:45] hey uh
[1:38:47] let's continue on with Philippians
[1:38:50] let me uh let me read a let me read the
[1:38:52] quote here
[1:38:53] on door to the heart brother Branham
[1:38:55] says this
[1:38:56] now if a man is a great man
[1:39:00] when you talk to him he will make you
[1:39:02] think that you are the great one
[1:39:05] but you take a man that just thinks he's
[1:39:08] somebody he tries to blow himself up all
[1:39:10] the time he's a when he's nobody
[1:39:13] just give him a change of clothes and
[1:39:14] he's a changed person but a real big man
[1:39:17] makes himself small
[1:39:19] that shows that the god of Heaven made
[1:39:21] himself a foot washer to mankind
[1:39:24] the Way Up Is Down
[1:39:26] he that humbles himself shall be exalted
[1:39:30] that's what the matter what's the matter
[1:39:31] with people today we don't want to
[1:39:33] accept that humility of the Gospel
[1:39:36] we want to think that we're just a
[1:39:38] little bit too good
[1:39:40] we know a little more than someone else
[1:39:45] Philippians 4 9 4 18 419 says this
[1:39:49] Paul closes his letter
[1:39:52] to the Philippians
[1:39:54] he says
[1:39:57] but my God shall supply all your needs
[1:40:00] according to his riches and Glory
[1:40:03] by Christ Jesus now unto God and our
[1:40:06] father be glory forever and ever amen
[1:40:08] salute every saint in Christ Jesus the
[1:40:10] brethren which are with me greet you and
[1:40:13] the Saints Salute You chiefly they the
[1:40:16] house of see they that are of Caesar's
[1:40:17] household the grace of our Lord Jesus
[1:40:19] Christ be with you all
[1:40:23] friends
[1:40:25] this
[1:40:27] book of Philippians this last
[1:40:29] chapter the sweetness of the Apostle how
[1:40:34] beautiful sisters are going to come up
[1:40:35] how sweet he was
[1:40:39] and we think of a Christian we think of
[1:40:41] all these great things
[1:40:44] and we should have miracles
[1:40:48] and we see Miracles and we should have
[1:40:51] more
[1:40:52] the door should be they should be be
[1:40:56] lined up at the doors to try to get into
[1:40:58] this church
[1:40:59] to be healed
[1:41:01] to be a part
[1:41:03] to be loved
[1:41:05] they should be they should be wanting to
[1:41:07] come in here
[1:41:09] when we go out when we go out somewhere
[1:41:11] if we go to the store
[1:41:13] you know as I said the things that come
[1:41:15] out your mouth the thoughts that you
[1:41:17] have are who you are
[1:41:18] when you go to the store and you talk to
[1:41:21] someone
[1:41:23] do you get angry at them
[1:41:25] if they do something wrong the waitress
[1:41:27] or the waiter at at the at the
[1:41:29] restaurant or whatever
[1:41:31] it is
[1:41:32] when you leave that place
[1:41:35] it should leave a spirit
[1:41:37] it should leave a spirit that says there
[1:41:39] was something special about her
[1:41:41] there was something special about him
[1:41:45] I want to be like that person
[1:41:47] when you're driving in your car
[1:41:49] and you're going around don't forget
[1:41:50] you're a Christian in your car too
[1:41:53] it doesn't change when you get in when
[1:41:54] you get behind the wheel
[1:41:57] when you're in there and you're driving
[1:42:00] you're still a Christian back off
[1:42:03] be a Christian let the guy in
[1:42:06] you know when we're
[1:42:07] wherever we are whatever we say whatever
[1:42:11] we do you'll find that a little bit of
[1:42:14] love
[1:42:16] will heal so many things
[1:42:19] it will I've seen it I've seen Miracles
[1:42:23] as I talked about the brother from
[1:42:25] England I've seen many many I could stay
[1:42:28] up here all night talking about the
[1:42:29] Miracles I've seen
[1:42:30] but the greatest of these things and
[1:42:33] where these Miracles come from is
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:42:36] it comes from people that care
[1:42:39] don't forget to reach out
[1:42:41] reach out to these people that are
[1:42:44] around you might like Paul said he said
[1:42:46] you know you thought about me
[1:42:49] and it makes me feel good just that you
[1:42:51] thought about me it doesn't have to be
[1:42:53] people in this church
[1:42:55] it should be too but it can be also
[1:42:58] people outside people that you work with
[1:43:00] how do your neighbors feel about you
[1:43:02] are they saying these people that live
[1:43:06] next to me those are Christians
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:10] that's who I want praying for me if I
[1:43:12] get sick
[1:43:13] that's how we should be in every aspect
[1:43:16] of Our Lives friends
[1:43:18] with me
[1:43:20] can we try harder love you'll find that
[1:43:24] when when you display that love it makes
[1:43:27] everything better
[1:43:29] it makes everything just happier
[1:43:32] you know as Jesus said and we always
[1:43:34] read in the communion service Jesus said
[1:43:36] if you do these things happy are you
[1:43:40] and we will be happier
[1:43:42] and let's continue on
[1:43:44] let's continue on in that love
[1:43:48] knowing that our lord Jesus
[1:43:52] is guiding our steps that they as they
[1:43:55] did with Peter and Paul and all the
[1:43:57] disciples
[1:43:59] display that love
[1:44:01] display to each other
[1:44:02] explain it to everybody you're around no
[1:44:05] matter how much people do you wrong
[1:44:08] how angry you get at them overcoming
[1:44:11] it's not worth your salvation
[1:44:13] and let me tell you something you can
[1:44:15] win that soul that's how you do it
[1:44:19] it's not in believe me
[1:44:22] it's not in how well you know this book
[1:44:25] and how well you know the author
[1:44:28] it was
[1:44:29] I'll close with this I was preaching
[1:44:31] last weekend
[1:44:33] in New Mexico
[1:44:36] and these two parents they have a
[1:44:39] daughter she's I don't know she's
[1:44:40] probably 17 16 17 years old
[1:44:44] and they came to me after service and
[1:44:46] they said brother
[1:44:49] this service really meant a lot to our
[1:44:52] daughter she really needed it
[1:44:55] she said she said this was the best
[1:44:57] service I've ever been in
[1:44:59] and I said okay good and and she said
[1:45:03] just both the the mom she had tears in
[1:45:06] her eyes and the dad they said thank you
[1:45:09] and uh
[1:45:10] okay
[1:45:12] I said
[1:45:13] what'd I say
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:18] you know a little bit of validation
[1:45:20] brother Tim but
[1:45:23] they said well
[1:45:25] after service
[1:45:27] they said
[1:45:29] when now in the Hispanic culture at
[1:45:32] church what they do is the people when
[1:45:35] they leave the first person out will
[1:45:37] stand at the door and then shake the
[1:45:39] next person's hand and then that person
[1:45:41] will go and stand next to that person
[1:45:43] and then the next person will shake this
[1:45:45] person's hand this person's hand and
[1:45:47] then that person will get over here so
[1:45:49] that way you shake everybody's hand
[1:45:51] in church
[1:45:53] and when I was going out I was shaking
[1:45:55] hands and I get to the young lady and
[1:45:57] she was so attentive
[1:45:58] and I said sister I just want to thank
[1:46:01] you for for listening so closely
[1:46:04] to my message it really helps me when
[1:46:06] people when people do that
[1:46:09] and the mom said when you told her that
[1:46:13] that's what meant so much to her
[1:46:16] that you cared
[1:46:18] but that's not what we say I mean we
[1:46:20] should do our best but if we can just
[1:46:24] display that love
[1:46:26] amen
[1:46:27] let's let's do it let's uh let's all
[1:46:29] stand brethren
[1:46:32] sisters brother Eddie would you come up
[1:46:35] and close in prayer my friend
