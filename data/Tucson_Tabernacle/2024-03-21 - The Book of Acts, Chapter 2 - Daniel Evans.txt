they seem to love the Lord and and just made a good impression on us so so welcome and here they are in church God bless you [Applause] it's good to see you and sister Salazar you're um you're a veteran you're a native welcome home God bless you we've been talking I felt it on my heart to start talking about on maybe Wednesday nights to start on a Bible study and last week we were into the first chapter of the book of Acts and if there is a book in this entire Bible that we should know it's that book of Acts it's got everything it's got doctrines like the godhead and baptism it's got miracles it's it's got missionary work it's got it all all packed into this one book so in Acts chapter 1 we it starts with the this letter that's addressed to this man theopolis and the the name sounds familiar so it talks it says to theopolis it says it says Theo theopolis this second essay that I am writing to you the first one was about all that Jesus said and all that Jesus started to do and and it talks about this first book about about all these things that Jesus did and then this writer is writing makes it sound like this is the second book so we look back and we see that there is another book in the Bible That's addressed to this same guy theopolis and it's the Book of Luke so we as we read we can see that almost with no doubt that the same author that wrote the book of Acts is the same author that wrote the Book of Luke which is Luke that's a pretty easy question so so we see that Luke is the author of This Book of Acts and and he lays this Foundation to this to this man who is I'm sure very very interested of what's going on in Jerusalem at this time what's going on with the Believers around the world in this new thing called Christianity so he says he lays this Foundation he says all that Jesus began to do and teach and then he he talks about Jesus and how that he appeared to the disciples after his death and his burial and he rose up and he appeared to the disciples and he said that he go up to this place go to Jerusalem and wait there until you are endued with power from on high and then Luke talks about how Jesus went up into the sky and these disciples are watching it and then these two men come to them and said Hey listen he says this Jesus that went up he's going to come down in the same way that he went up one day so the the disciples there they're I'm sure they're tremendously excited but then they were also being persecuted and threatened to death so then they go and they go into this place exactly as Jesus instructed them into this place in Jerusalem and we call it the upper room it was a room that was probably on top of a building of a small building so let's dig in to the word let's go to Acts chapter 2. now we call this the day of Pentecost it's a very very interesting thing that happened and like I said besides maybe the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus this is probably the single most important thing that had ever happened in all of history you could say well what about when God created the heavens and the Earth what would have been for nothing well what about when God created man and God created his wife what about then well it would have been nothing they would have all died and been lost if it wasn't for these times this this Lord Jesus when he died and was resurrected and then at this day of Pentecost we're going to see that this was the time that Jesus went from a man into a spirit that dwelt in 120 people all at one time a tremendous time in history now when we say Pentecost Pentecost is it's a Jewish feast day it's like it's like a um it's like a holiday and what it was is it was it just means 50 days Pentecost just the word just means 50 days and what it was is it was after the Passover then 50 days later you know the Passover when Moses was here and and the death angel came and and they were eating the unleavened bread in in the house and they put the the blood of the Lamb on the doorpost and on the on the side there and then after that 50 days later they celebrated another holiday which is say it brother Lyle yes just like he said it they celebrated that holiday and and basically as I said 50 Pentecost just means 50. so what's really interesting here before we even get started is we know exactly when the day of Pentecost was so we had the um the the uh the Feast of the Passover remember Jesus got his disciples together and they ate the communion we call it the communion which was the Feast of the Passover 50 days from that time is when this happened so Jesus died Jesus went to the cross the next day so maybe 49 days after it after he went to the cross and we can just count down the days until less than two months later this Spirit comes down on the disciples Acts chapter 2. verse one my friend and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place that when it says when the day of Pentecost had fully come that means it had arrived that that was the day and uh and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now listen this is the very first Christian Church that ever was it started with 120 people and it Formed right here on this day that I that we are talking about right now this is the beginning this is the beginning of of what's happened throughout the world and you'll notice that this first outpouring of the Holy Spirit it came in three ways first it came in an audible way and it was the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind and if you'll notice you can look back through the Old Testament and you can see that the Lord spoke to job in a whirlwind the Lord spoke to David he knew it was time to go to battle when he heard that wind go through the mulberry trees so we can see that this isn't something new this is something that God had done before and it was the sound of this and as I was Reese as I was looking at this the Hebrew and the Greek words for wind are the same word for Spirit tremendous Little Nugget there and then when this when this sound now it wasn't necessarily a win it was just the sound of this of this rushing Mighty Wind came through then and it was about it was maybe twice as many people as in this room right now maybe a little less than that they were they were there and then these these pillars of Fire came down and rested over each one this is the second we heard we hear it first audibly with the rushing Mighty Wind and then we see it visibly it's not fire the hair didn't catch on fire it was fire like the burning bush we look back you see how God used fire there didn't consume the bush but it looked like fire it's a symbol of God that that that has been used many many times over and then there was there was they heard that audibly then they saw it visibly and then it came orally in speaking with tongues with and it was it was a very very cool thing that happened right there very very different than some than what they had heard before but we'll get to that here in a minute and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not these which would speak galileans now people from the certain part of the country had different accents and every whenever they heard they heard this they they spoke exactly like they did with the exact maybe same accent as the person hearing it or maybe the same language as the person hearing it how here we every man in our own own tongue wherein we were born parthians and medes and elamites and dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and in Cappadocia in Pontius and Asia frigia and pamphilia in Egypt and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene and strangers of Rome Jews and proselytes cretes and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God this was a necessity they needed to have this the church had formed with 120 in that upper room they were filled with the Holy Spirit now they had to go out and they they weren't necessarily preaching the gospel they were testifying of what God had done in their lives they were testifying of what they had seen and heard these wonderful works of God that that they had seen and they were speaking in languages that was from were familiar to the people that were hearing them I gave a testimony not too long ago about a brother that I had met from Congo and this brother he had a desire in his heart to bring the gospel to the pygmies in Central and Northern Congo the problem that he faced is he didn't speak the language a huge barrier that if I'm going to witness to somebody that maybe speaks Spanish and I can only get out a couple words I'm not going to do a good job so his name's um Alfred tischbango so so brother Alfred was he prayed and he he fasted and he said Lord I need to know this language if you want me to bring the gospel to these to these idolaters in the jungle so he prayed and he fasted the Lord later on his heart to fast and he fasted for seven days and at the end of his fast he got hungry and he sat down he made himself a nice meal and he sat down and he prayed over his food and he began speaking in the native tongue of the pygmy people and today he may be there right now today brother Alfred is spreading the gospel to the people in the jungles to the to these pygmy people oh yeah this led to to another story this led to the the gospel just being spread throughout these jungles and and it was spreading in areas where there were gorillas and it was going throughout this this area so I got a phone call when I was in Jeffersonville I got a phone call from a reporter in England and this reporter you know they talk funny anyways the the people from England and he said yes he says uh I would just like to know and I was in and of course you know I was I was in William Branham Ministries and he says I I would like to I would like to ask you a question he says do the uh did William Branham did he teach that people should eat monkeys and you know I was like oh great this is a setup what's gonna happen and I was okay you know this is gonna be the newspapers or something he's a reporter he's I think he was in London and I said uh I don't know what you mean he said he said well did he teach that that people should eat monkeys namely great apes I said bro I don't know what you're talking about I said he was he was actually a game warden he didn't teach that you should kill anything that you that you can't eat and and he didn't he didn't teach any of that and so he we go back and forth for a while and I am as confused as you can be and finally he leveled with me and he said listen he said these pygmies and these other Bantu tribes in the jungles he said they worshiped the Apes the gorillas he said they they worshiped them because they thought that they were Reincarnation of their ancestors and he said when your message goes into these jungles he said they no longer fear these and he said they started eating them he said Can you issue an edict or something to to get them to stop I said no brother I said we're not we're not Catholic I mean they're on their own there's nothing I can do um I don't know why I told that story um speaking in tongues is something that it's uh it came in two different ways I told you another story of there was a brother that's a dear friend of mine there was an altar call and there were some French Canadians there and there was a sister she was kneeling down at the altar and she was praying and she was asking the Lord for certain things and my friend came up to her and he laid his hand on her and he prayed for her now her first language was French but she still spoke English and afterwards she told my friend she says brother you speak perfect French and he says I've never I can't speak a word of French and he's and she said when you came to me and you were praying for me she said I heard you in perfect French perfect Quebec French it was the same thing that was going on here in the book of Acts where when they were witnessing about these things and they were spreading the gospel they were maybe speaking like I'm speaking but people were Hearing in their own language it was a miracle now there's a difference between the two dif there's there's a different type of speaking in tongues that Paul addresses in First Corinthians chapter 14. in First Corinthians chapter 14 it's an unknown tongue it's a tongue that doesn't mean anything to you and me and Paul said that when you speak in in an unknown tongue that there needs to be an interpreter there and then when that interpreter interprets what you're speaking then it becomes prophecy to the church and he and he he admonishes them he says now now when you're speaking in tongues and there's no interpreter or you're just maybe just worshiping and I've seen I've myself have been worshiping and just started speaking in tongues and I've and and other people and he's and Paul said now when you do that don't draw attention to yourself and stand up in church and and speak in tongues because the visitors won't know what you're doing he said keep that to yourself and he makes one statement he says the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet so the spirit of the one giving the prophecy is subject to that person so that person has control they don't have they don't have to give the prophecy they can wait until the appropriate time but this in this case so there's there's different types of speaking in tongues but in this case they were speaking like brother shebango they were speaking in an audible language that they understood this happened I just thought this happened with brother Branham when there was a man named Danny Henry that was coming in the prayer line and he came up to brother Branham and there was witnesses around and he started speaking in tongues and this man didn't speak another language and it turns out from the people around it it was French that he was speaking in and there was different ones that wrote down the translation you know the story they wrote down the translation and they both gave the exact same interpretation that is the same thing that happened at the day of Pentecost here verse 12. and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what mean is this others mocking and said these men are full of new wine now this is a Bible study so I want to make sure we don't go too far without understanding what we're reading what is this this word new wine what does that mean the wine as I was as I was looking and I said Lord I want to understand what this new wine is does it mean like the the cheap wine that hasn't been maybe fermented as long or what there's there's new wine that's in a positive context in the Bible so as I studied this this is the only time that this certain Greek word is used in the Bible and what it is is it's probably a very sweet wine that has a really high alcohol content now the wine back then was fairly weak it was very common didn't have a lot of alcohol in it but this was probably a very very strong wine that had that had a lot of sugar added to it when they were in the fermenting process and it's uh what it was was these people were making fun of what was going on they were ridiculing they were mocking these people that that had received the Holy Spirit and they went out and they were speaking in these these tongues and it didn't it didn't quite mesh maybe with the way they thought the way they believed so they were trying to find something to criticize them with but you look at it and say how could wine make you speak in other languages real languages it was ridiculous but they were just trying to they were trying to criticize but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for those for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is about the third hour of the day third hour of the day I believe the day starts at Sunrise third hour of the day is probably about nine o'clock so it's nine in the morning and and Peter's like no they're not drunk but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel Joel 2 28 says this and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions notice that it says afterward now this next verse verse 17 in the book of Acts Peter is quoting Joel and he says these people aren't drunk as you're thinking but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel and then Peter quotes him now notice how Peter says this and this was confusing to me and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God Joel said it shall come to pass afterward Peter says and it shall come quoting Joel says it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and I was I was looking at this and I said Lord I don't understand that it says in the last days but this was 2 000 years ago that this happened how can that be and thinking about these things and and thinking about how that this second coming of Christ it's talked about as we know in the Book of Revelation chapter 8. the seventh seal and it says something very simple we go through our first six seals in chapter six chapter seven talks about the 144 000 and then chapter eight it says and the seventh seal sounded and there was silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour a very mysterious a very secretive thing we know that this seventh seal is the coming of the Lord but yet it had to be so Secret so Satan could it and couldn't get in there and cause problems that he didn't give any time he just said there was silence in the space in in heaven for the space of a half an hour no one knows when Christ had returned even Jesus himself said that he doesn't know only the father knows so when we are making ready for this second coming and it and what I what I got here is when it says when it says that in the last days it's really just anything after the resurrection of Christ now if you read if you read in the Epistles especially in Peter you see that that these disciples they thought that it was going to be tomorrow and they were always making ready and it's like that by Design so when the people they're always looking for the Lord to come and he always wants us to be ready and making provisions and constantly thinking Lord are you coming today because he loves us he wants us to be ready because our time for the Lord coming may be tonight it may be on our way home it doesn't necessarily have to be the rapture it doesn't necessarily have to be as as in the as Luke said that these angels said that he's going to come in the same way that he went up he's going to come down and the world's going to see him it may not be in that way it may be that we die tonight that our Earthly life ends and that's the way that the Bible the New Testament is written is always be ready because no one knows when he is coming we can see the signs if I said as I said before that that in the last days perilous times shall come that that we're going to see that these signs start to happen and we're going to know that we're in the last days but he doesn't tell us when it's protected it's protected for our own good because if we say it's going to be next year we as humans might say well I don't have to get ready if we say it's going to be in 365 days well I'll wait till 364 days you might die between then and now we don't know when our time is called we don't know when when the Lord's going to take us so we need to be always ready for when he comes and that's why it says in the last days it's anything after the coming of Christ it's anything after this Holy Spirit Falls always be ready and that's why it says in the last days and that's why that it could be fulfilled there at the day of Pentecost when Peter says that this is going to happen in the last days because no one knows verse number 18. and on my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy remember the author here Luke and I I pointed out last last time that it was important to Luke to mention the sisters notice he says that on my servants and on my hands mates on the brothers and the sisters I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in heaven and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon and the blood before the great and notable day of the Lord come this is referencing the second coming of Christ and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the Lord shall be saved what is the name of the Lord when the thief was on the cross there was there was two men when the thief was on the cross he had not been baptized he he didn't have he had done nothing but sin his whole life but yet he was there and he called Upon Jesus and Jesus says this day you'll be with me in Paradise I want to be in the same place that that Thief was I want to be with Christ and that is why it says here that you have to call upon the name of of the Lord to be saved ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know now look at the proof that Peter gives for Christ why is it so important to us that we have miracles if these miracles and want to be careful but if these Miracles are not following us then there's something wrong Jesus said that these these signs shall follow them that believe and Peter here is saying that he's the Christ look look what's happened look at all the Miracles that he did not just one miracle but Miracle after Miracle after miracle him Jesus being delivered by the determinate Council and the foreknowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain now remember this is the first sermon ever preached by a Holy Spirit-filled Christian him being delivered by the determinant Peter's saying this him being being delivered by the determinant Council and foreknowledge of God you have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loosed the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should beholden of it second sign here is the resurrection the first sign that Peter mentions is Miracles but he's what Peter is doing here is he's separating Jesus from the prophets and everyone else there was Miracle after Miracle after miracle in the Bible from from day one he's a supernatural God all the way to Jesus we see miracles but we do not see a man that could die and raise himself back up until we saw Jesus so here you give Peter gives two he gives two examples and it's an it's it's a perfect example of the godhead let me let me read that number 24 again whom God has raised up so he's talking about Jesus when he had died and Peter says who God has raised up but Jesus himself said I Lay My Life down and I can take it back up again so how could Peter say well God raised him up and then Jesus himself so I raised myself up whether the same person it's an easy the equation is one plus one equals two he is God it's the same person and then Peter continues on here he says for David's David speaketh concerning him I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved he's quoting a psalm therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou Wilt not leave my soul in Hell neither will thy suffer thy Holy Holy One to see corruption again he's quoting psalm 16. written by David thou Hast made known to me the ways of life thou shall make me full of joy with thy countenance now now Peter he's quoting the psalm there now he starts to preach he says men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried in his Sepulcher which is his grave his Sepulcher is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath that the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on the throne he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption David was one of the greatest men That Ever Walked the Earth but yet even he being a king and a prophet could not raise himself from the dead this Jesus Peter continues this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we are all Witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which ye now see and hear for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the Lord saith unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thy foes thy footstool quoting another Psalm psalm 110. therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made the same Jesus who you crucified both Lord and Christ this Messiah that was to come was not only a king but he was also God himself as I said before now I was a mouthful to a bunch of Jews that was a big deal what he was saying they had just crucified Jesus for saying the same thing and now here is Peter with the same spirit that Jesus had remember before he ran away Jesus stood strong and they said are you the king of Israel he says will you say that I am and here is is Jesus he stood Brave as you could be and now and Peter runs away and forsakes the Lord forsakes him three times even cusses so people will think that he's not part of Jesus and here is this same man walking up before all these Jews and preaching us boldly as the Lord Jesus preached I love this part look at the difference in what happened here versus what happened when Jesus was crucified now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do how many times have we seen people young people old people how many times have we seen people the Lord works on their hearts and they've lived a sinful life and then something happens inside of them where they feel bad they start feeling bad for what they've done and and I've been through it I think we've all been through it you know when I was when I was your all's age young lady's age is when the Lord was really dealing with me when I was about 20 years old and how I just started feeling bad for what I was doing and and I came to the place I said Lord I I don't want this anymore I need something different and that's the same feeling that these people had they were like wow this is this is real this is real this man did Miracles this man did all of this and they crucified him and he rose from the dead just like Peter was saying and Peter was there and all these people were there and there's 120 of them and they're speaking in different languages and they're doing all these Miracles like whoa this is real I'm a sinner Peter I need what you have and then that sweetness of a tender heart says this it says I'll read it again now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do I feel bad I've messed up in my life now what do I need to do because I want to be forgiven I want that relationship that you have Peter and Peter said these words and all of us can probably quote them Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you will receive the same thing that I got now notice with baptism the first thing that comes is repentance I feel bad for what I've done and I need to make it right I Repent I'm sorry and then you go to baptism now remission doesn't it doesn't mean that your sins can be remitted I've heard some ministers preach that that when you're baptized when you go down under the water and you come back up then that's when your sins are forgiven that can't be your sins were forgiven when Jesus died on the cross two thousand years ago that is when the atonement was made but now you are making an outward expression of what the Lord is doing inside of you that is what baptism is he died once for our sins he didn't have to go do it again that happened two thousand years ago and our sins were remitted there but we have to accept that and Peter says be baptized for the remission of your essential remission means it says taken away forgiveness of your sins they're gone they are completely wiped out through the blood of Jesus Christ for this and Peter continues for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call that means us that's 2 000 years three thousand however long time goes on is how long that promise lasts and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this untoward generation that word is crooked corrupt save yourself from this corrupt generation and they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day that were added unto them about three thousand Souls let me tell you something you get the Holy Ghost and you start presenting that and these things start happening you watch people start coming because they're going to see I see something in this person that I want I see a love that they have I see I see a doctrine that they have I see that they have Miracles that follow them and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrines and fellowship and breaking of bread and in prayers now look at the four things that the writer here writes Luke writes the apostles Doctrine they continuing in the apostles Doctrine which is the doctrine of Christ this wasn't a lukewarm feel good religion this is the apostles Doctrine Paul comes a little bit later but he was an apostle these are things they preached against lying they preached against gossiping I could I could go on for for a long time just for those two things just in the New Testament they preached against adultery they preached against divorce they preached against laziness they preached against not doing anything they preached against these things they continued in these doctrines and Fellowship the big move today is to stay home from church just streaming just get on YouTube and find your favorite preacher and and go there or stay home and just listen to the sermons from home just listen to your tapes at home that is absolutely against what their this is saying here in Acts chapter 2. it's wrong if brother Lyle how can I fellowship with you if I never see you I guess we could do on teams and and on on Zoom or whatever no I mean it might might be okay but if I never see you I don't know you and it's the same with us it's then it's not just with church it's outside of church we should love to be together it's Fellowship that's two things he mentions here and then come an income breaking of bread which is the communion we don't neglect communion I've told you before one of the most common questions that I got when I was in the ministry in Jeffersonville is can I take communion at home and what was my answer why and it was always that I didn't see things like this group of people they didn't believe things like I believe constantly asking that question and I I respond saying well do they believe Jesus well yeah well do they believe in communion well yeah well what do you what was wrong you want to separate yourself from those people because maybe you don't see the seventh seal the same maybe because you don't see dressed the same so you're gonna separate yourself from those people and break exactly what is written here in Acts chapter 2. and then the next thing is prayer they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and breaking bread and in prayers and this is where I think the church may fall the most short I know it's something that me I look at myself and I said Lord I need to spend more time with you can you imagine getting on your knees and talking with the one that created the heavens and the Earth millions of angels are surrounding him the ones that are closest to him can't even they can't even show their face or their feet because his presence is so holy and I can get on my knees and I can commune with that being and I have something else to do I'm too tired you know why I'm too tired because I make myself too tired you know why I have something else to do because I spend too much time watching YouTube on my iPad because I waste too much time and I could be there talking communing with that one in prayer I look at these Servants of the Lord in the Bible I look at Peter he was up on the housetop in prayer and God gave him a vision to go to the Gentiles I was I look at the Lord Jesus himself the Bible says he prayed all night before he chose those 12 disciples before he made that decision that's the Son of God and how much time do I spend with the Lord and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles remember there's a difference as I said in chapter 1 between Apostles and disciples we should be making disciples to Jesus those that believe Jesus those that sin under Jesus's Ministry but when you become an apostle you have a mission you're sent forth and all that believed were together and had all things in common they sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need look at how close this Fellowship was look at how beautiful this was and how much these people loved each other if they had a big house brother Lyle they had Friday young people's fellowship with a taco bar and a bonfire and ice cream afterwards if they had a little bit of extra time brother Merle they went up and put together furniture all day long for two days for the young people they took what they had and they put it to work for the gospel they had land and they sold it they wanted to see it go forth they had they took what they had and they put it to work these aren't a bunch of socialists and Communists where they take everything and they give it to the pastor and then he says okay well I'll give you some and you some no that's not what this is talking about they took what they had and they put it to work and that's what we should be doing everything and I see a little bit of it but it needs to be more if you have time put it to work for the Lord and they continued daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart wrapping it up the musicians can come forward please and they continued let me read that again and they continued daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart I had a Minister's meeting but while you were there I think you were there when I when I spoke at the one of the first ministers meetings in Arizona the question was how do we all get in one Accord as they were in the book of Acts and you'll notice that they were in one Accord because they had one purpose and that purpose was to spread the gospel we can never be in agreement we can never be in unity we can never get along unless we all have the same purpose in life and if our purpose in life is constantly serving ourselves I'm just working towards retirement I'm just I I'm just working towards having this job and and and and making my way in this world those things are good but our purpose if we want to be in complete Unity as they were in this book we have to have one purpose and that purpose is Christ now purpose is serving Christ and that purpose is the same as it is here getting people to him you'll see you see in the the war in Ukraine and how Ukraine is just given Russia the hardest time and there had been for the past year Russia's got weapons they've got everything that they need to beat this country but this country has come together in one Accord to fight for their own land and they're gonna fight till they die and that is why that they are being successful is because they have one Mission and that's to save their home and if we could have that and push like these disciples did in Acts chapter 2. that is where Unity will come from we always think that there's going to be a white magic wand waved and all of a sudden we're all going to love each other that's not going to happen what needs to happen is that we get our minds focused on one thing and that is Jesus Christ not on our doctrines that separate us but on Christ that died for us and getting other people to our Lord I had an experience after you all left on um I'll tell it on Sunday that I really believe it was from the Lord I was thinking about our visitors here and I was I was just I was just feeling good and Daniel and I we um we walked in here it was late at night and we walked in we were turning off the lights in the church last night and we walked in we came in the back door right over where brother Arnie is the door where everybody came in and the lights were just on the platform and I'll tell you what buddy I was overwhelmed the Beauty and the reverence and the presence that was here the lights off and just just the light with this here in this pulpit and what it meant and to think how many people have come to this altar and giving giving their hearts to the Lord and and have gone on to be with the Lord now uh I was overwhelmed when I was looking at it and I had to go get Daniel I said buddy I want to show you something I went we came in and we came back in the back and and he looked and I was like wow there is something special there's something special about this and if we could just get our minds on Christ if we can just get our minds on the one that died on this cross as they did here in the book of Acts then I believe that we would see the same results as they received here and I'm looking forward to learning more about this book and and seeing these manifestations verse number 7 47. praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved I'm not satisfied I'll never be satisfied with my life we could fill this place up and have a thousand people I'll never be satisfied until that one person that's out on the street that is a sinner comes in and then maybe another one and maybe another one we should never be satisfied with anything that's accomplished we should never neglect reaching out as they did here they had a mission two thousand years later we have the same Mission not to introduce people to how we believe brother Jonathan but to introduce people to a living Jesus Christ that is our goal and that's what this book is about I'm looking forward to hearing more let's stand [Music] God bless you all let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we thank you we thank you that you preserve this book called the book of Acts and Lord we as we read through this we want to maybe find ourselves in this book do everything we can just to make life a little bit better for someone Lord and if we could use any any skill that you've given us as the disciples said had they had all things in common and Lord if it's opening up our homes if it's reaching out a helping hand if it's preaching the gospel if it's witnessing if it's praying for the sick whatever it is Lord let's let us use whatever we have to further your kingdom I believe that's the spirit of this book and father may we get into that same spirit we love you Lord in Jesus name amen Jordan God bless you all [Applause] [Music] right and true with Thanksgiving living [Music] baby
