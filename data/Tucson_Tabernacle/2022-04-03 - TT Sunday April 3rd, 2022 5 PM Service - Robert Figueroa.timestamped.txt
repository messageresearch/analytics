[42:47] we have a sunday morning service and
[42:49] then we're we're done but
[42:51] uh brother aaron was persistent and
[42:54] here i am he called me a few times and i

[43:00] i lost my own brother i do want to come

[43:03] wrong time
[43:05] but i i enjoy preaching the tucson
[43:07] tabernacle and
[43:08] and you have a wonderful spirit and it's
[43:10] always been a a pleasure to stand behind
[43:13] this pulpit if you have your bible tell
[43:15] me all sisters thank you
[43:20] just one little scripture in psalms
[43:22] chapter 22 verse 3.
[43:26] i don't know how far i'm going to get in
[43:27] this in this uh
[43:29] sermon because it's pretty long but
[43:31] there's some things in here that are
[43:33] very important i think we should hear
[43:35] um
[43:36] let's
[43:37] read this psalms 22 3 says but thou art
[43:40] holy
[43:41] oh thou
[43:43] that inhabitest the praises of israel
[43:46] father bless your word this evening lord
[43:49] and
[43:49] lord our efforts of everyone is here
[43:51] that made an effort to be here tonight
[43:53] lord and that you would just bless that
[43:55] lord and have your way amongst us god
[43:58] and that won't be just another service
[44:00] lord but maybe something special that
[44:02] that we can remember lord that something
[44:04] that will help us
[44:06] in our walk with you lord
[44:08] i ask your anointing father that you'll
[44:10] anoint me and anoint the hearts to
[44:12] receive your word
[44:14] lord that nothing will be said father
[44:15] that that you would not have a say lord
[44:18] it will be you speaking through this
[44:20] vessel lord as the prophet god would say
[44:23] your unworthy servant
[44:25] just get out of the way and let you have
[44:27] your way amongst his father and we just
[44:29] ask this in jesus christ's name amen and
[44:32] amen you may be seated
[44:35] the the title of what i want to speak
[44:37] tonight is
[44:38] a little strange
[44:41] but i'd have to get to the end of the
[44:42] sermon before you realize why i named it
[44:44] this but i am music
[44:47] and i write the
[44:48] songs you know music has a a power
[44:53] to influence us mentally
[44:55] physically
[44:56] spiritually
[44:59] the right kind of music has a mystical
[45:02] power
[45:03] that can bring the presence of god
[45:06] where you are
[45:07] or even better said can lift you up into
[45:10] his presence
[45:13] and
[45:14] this scripture i just read it says that
[45:16] he loves
[45:19] for us to praise him
[45:21] the bible says he inhabits
[45:24] our praises
[45:26] what does that mean i believe he likes
[45:28] to be around when he's being praised
[45:31] and and i believe that it does something
[45:33] to our hearts as well
[45:36] the bible tells us that the lord finds
[45:39] pleasure
[45:41] in the praises of his people and you
[45:43] know the hebrew word for psalms
[45:46] is
[45:47] book of praise
[45:49] here's a man after god's own heart david
[45:53] a man after god's own heart
[45:56] a man that god looked at him and loved
[45:59] him he was special to god why was it he
[46:03] wrote most of the songs
[46:05] and it was a book of praise it was about
[46:08] praising him
[46:10] there is something about our praise
[46:12] i mean that's why the order of the
[46:14] church is is first you know have a
[46:16] brother come up here and lead the song
[46:18] service
[46:20] and i believe many times we miss the
[46:23] boat there
[46:24] because that is to prepare us
[46:27] and get us ready
[46:29] for what god is going to speak
[46:32] we are we're trying to prepare our
[46:34] hearts and that's what the song leader
[46:36] that's his job is to get us
[46:39] to begin to open up our hearts
[46:42] as we praise his name as we worship him
[46:46] as brother man would say
[46:48] we are we are priests and and we bring
[46:51] our sacrifice of praise unto the lord
[46:55] amen
[46:57] the psalms range from classical
[47:01] presentations written for temple
[47:03] musicians
[47:04] to the simple but expressive ballads
[47:07] which david composed while he was
[47:10] tending his sheep
[47:12] can you imagine where a lot of the songs
[47:15] that we as brother larry and i can say
[47:17] this
[47:18] coming from a hispanic and the apostolic
[47:20] church was a spanish
[47:22] denomination
[47:23] many of the ones that came out of that
[47:25] that that started that that church or
[47:27] that movement came out of a sousa street
[47:31] and and they were filled with the holy
[47:33] ghost
[47:35] and there was a power over these people
[47:37] and they began to write songs that to
[47:40] this day they bless me
[47:43] i get on youtube and there's a youtube
[47:45] area where i get and i just hear those
[47:46] songs and over and over and over they
[47:49] continue to bless me
[47:51] and yet other songs have been written in
[47:53] and you know sometimes you know the the
[47:55] gospel industry is a billion dollar
[47:58] industry
[47:59] and not everything out there that is
[48:01] called christian music
[48:03] unfortunately is cr is not isn't
[48:06] christian music
[48:08] and too much too much of it is getting
[48:10] it finding his way into the church
[48:13] and we have to put our be on guard all
[48:15] the time be careful
[48:18] you know in the book of psalms you will
[48:19] find rally songs and
[48:21] marching songs
[48:23] victory songs
[48:26] teaching songs
[48:28] there are songs of repentance
[48:31] we we we can
[48:33] read where when david after he had
[48:35] sinned and and and and and uh his sin
[48:38] had been uh shouted for them from the
[48:40] house top if you will
[48:42] he began to pray and as god purged me
[48:45] with his sup
[48:46] and i shall be clean wash me
[48:49] and i shall be whiter than snow
[48:52] make me to hear joy and gladness at the
[48:55] bones you have you have broken me
[48:57] rejoice
[48:58] he said hide my my sins from your face
[49:02] blot out all of my iniquities
[49:06] creating me a clean heart oh god
[49:09] and renew a right spirit within me
[49:12] we need that right spirit i believe
[49:14] songs as we praise him as we worship him
[49:18] it brings the right spirit
[49:21] you can be down and i'm sure maybe
[49:23] you've done this in in your in your
[49:25] testimony you could say there's been
[49:27] times i was depressed i was down and i
[49:28] just started to worship him
[49:30] i just started to sing
[49:33] and the whole thing just changed
[49:35] you know how brother brahm told us that
[49:36] we can we are amateur creators
[49:39] and we can create the atmosphere around
[49:41] us
[49:42] amen we can change the atmosphere
[49:46] you can be so down and everything going
[49:48] wrong and but you if you just focus on
[49:51] him
[49:52] and begin to worship him
[49:54] get lost in the worship of christ
[49:58] you can change the atmosphere in a home
[50:02] you can change the way people feel
[50:05] amen
[50:07] lamentation also is found in the psalms
[50:12] petitions are found there
[50:14] praise
[50:16] and renewal
[50:18] and thanksgiving
[50:20] god
[50:22] loves to be praised
[50:25] he devoted a whole book in the bible to
[50:27] it
[50:28] just praise
[50:29] amen
[50:32] there in psalms 100 one of the shortest
[50:34] chapters in psalms it says make a joyful
[50:37] noise unto the lord
[50:40] it's not about finding the right key
[50:43] i know you musicians you got to have
[50:44] that right key and i understand that god
[50:47] puts this perfectionist in you that just
[50:49] got to be just right
[50:50] but you know god doesn't care
[50:54] i i i i dare say brother brown couldn't
[50:56] hold the tune in the bucket but he knew
[50:58] how to worship god
[51:00] he knew how to worship that i've heard
[51:02] other brothers too that that can't hold
[51:04] the two but yet when they begin to
[51:06] worship amen to worship god with all our
[51:09] heart brother green says every time he
[51:11] saw brother branham in the car
[51:13] going past him or coming to him he was
[51:15] always singing
[51:17] and by him by himself
[51:20] and and and and there was always seem to
[51:22] see that song one of them one of them
[51:25] i'm so glad
[51:27] that i could say i'm one of them
[51:29] aren't you glad tonight
[51:31] amen i'm so glad that i can say i'm one
[51:35] of them
[51:36] the blood bot the redeemed of the earth
[51:38] hallelujah
[51:40] the ones whose garments have been washed
[51:42] by the blood of jesus
[51:44] hallelujah
[51:46] no ye he says that the lord he is god
[51:50] he it is he that has made us
[51:53] and not we ourselves
[51:56] we are his people
[51:57] and the sheep of his pasture
[52:00] enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[52:05] enter into his courts with praise
[52:07] be thankful unto him
[52:10] and bless his name
[52:12] for the lord is good and his mercy
[52:15] is everlasting amen
[52:18] and his truth endureth
[52:20] to all generations brother earth
[52:23] i'm so glad it endured all the way to
[52:25] this generation
[52:27] amen his truth endureth to all
[52:30] generations the bible also shows us
[52:33] that man has a long and has long been
[52:35] aware
[52:36] of the effect of music
[52:39] about our daily existence
[52:41] and his power to influence people both
[52:44] physically and emotionally and and
[52:45] because of that many times there's there
[52:48] there can be songs that are made that
[52:49] could that could help us to to get into
[52:52] the right mood in the right atmosphere
[52:54] but there's also songs that that cause
[52:56] shame as well
[52:58] you know brother brown says in in the
[53:00] message make a valley full of dishes
[53:02] he says you know someone told me not
[53:05] long ago
[53:08] said brother bran music
[53:10] in the church is wrong i said it is
[53:12] i said do you think god changes his
[53:14] nature
[53:16] no
[53:16] i said
[53:18] then when the prophet got all stewed up
[53:20] and they said bring a minstrel
[53:23] and when the mystery began to play
[53:25] the hand of the lord come down on the
[53:28] prophet
[53:30] and if music i'm quoting the prophet
[53:32] if and if music brought the power of god
[53:35] then it'll bring the power of god now
[53:39] amen the right kind of music if we come
[53:42] and if we can get learn to enter in to
[53:45] that worship
[53:47] amen
[53:49] there's a saying that says too many that
[53:51] are that are
[53:52] singing standing on the promises are
[53:55] just standing on the premises
[53:58] and we need to enter in not to be not to
[54:00] be a a a a one is watching but be a
[54:04] participator to be a partaker
[54:07] of those blessings
[54:09] amen
[54:11] we find that the king saul there in in
[54:14] uh first samuel 16 23 when he would uh
[54:18] this evil spirit would get a hold of him
[54:21] and they would bring little little david
[54:23] with his harp and david would play the
[54:26] harp and sing to him and that evil
[54:28] spirit would leave
[54:30] see it brings a presence
[54:33] the right kind of song the right kind of
[54:35] singing from the right kind of heart
[54:38] i said so we've got to be the right kind
[54:40] of heart
[54:41] too many times we're singing and we're
[54:43] just voicing the words
[54:46] we're just moving our lips
[54:48] but as jesus said their heart is far
[54:50] from me when we enter into worship we
[54:53] need to be
[54:54] focusing in on the words that we're
[54:57] singing
[54:58] and let it come from our heart amen
[55:02] in second chronicles chapter 20 and 21
[55:06] verse 21 you know israel put a choir of
[55:09] musical instruments as they were going
[55:10] into the battle
[55:12] they're in second chronicles let me read
[55:14] it to you and when he had consulted with
[55:16] the people he appointed
[55:19] singers unto the lord that should praise
[55:22] the beauty of holiness
[55:24] as they went out before the army to say
[55:26] praise the lord
[55:28] for his mercy endureth forever
[55:32] and when they began to sing and to
[55:33] praise the lord set ambushments against
[55:37] the children of amman moab and mounsier
[55:40] which were come against judah and they
[55:43] were smitten
[55:45] it brought victory
[55:47] if we can have the right kind of heart
[55:49] and get in the right kind of spirit and
[55:51] sing the songs that please god it'll
[55:53] bring victory into our lives
[55:56] you know the english back in the days of
[55:58] the colonial times and the french and
[56:00] all the european armies they all
[56:03] always marched into the battle with
[56:05] music
[56:06] because they got this from they got that
[56:07] from here
[56:08] they had the drummers and the musicians
[56:10] and they were playing they're trying to
[56:12] pick up the valor of the soldiers
[56:14] because they were going to go into the
[56:15] battle
[56:16] amen and we're in a battle
[56:19] i said we're in a battle
[56:21] amen
[56:23] we need that the right kind of music
[56:26] in the church especially
[56:28] and when the song leader gets up here
[56:30] help him
[56:31] you know we need to help each other out
[56:34] it's like the preacher gets up here to
[56:35] preach you need to you need to say sick
[56:38] them to the devil
[56:39] you say amen brother robert
[56:41] amen brother aaron amen praise the lord
[56:46] amen
[56:48] music with all its effect
[56:50] that it has on us think
[56:53] just think where
[56:54] did music begin
[56:57] where did it come from
[57:00] way back in genesis we find that there
[57:02] in chapter 4
[57:04] verse 20 and 21 it says and ada bear
[57:07] jabel and he was a father such as dwell
[57:09] in tents and of such as have cattle and
[57:12] his brother's name was jubal he was the
[57:15] father of such that has handled the harp
[57:18] and organ so we find that from kane's
[57:20] line
[57:21] they began to make the instruments and
[57:24] they began to use music
[57:27] to whatever effect they want the dance
[57:29] we find in the bible
[57:31] when god had overthrown the egyptian
[57:33] army and we find that the women and
[57:36] mariam taking the tambourine and dancing
[57:39] on the red seashore
[57:41] the holy ghost will set your feet to
[57:43] dancing
[57:45] the holy ghost will thrill you through
[57:47] and through
[57:49] get in the right spirit
[57:51] amen get into god's program what's
[57:54] taking place many times like i said we
[57:56] miss the boat because we let the worship
[57:59] just go right over our heads we don't
[58:00] prepare ourselves then when the preacher
[58:02] preaching comes we don't get anything no
[58:05] benefit
[58:06] because our hearts were prepared
[58:10] amen
[58:13] later when david brought the ark
[58:15] of the lord into jerusalem
[58:17] he danced before the lord
[58:20] i don't think he was just dancing like a
[58:22] crazy man out there with no music i
[58:23] think there was music
[58:25] if he danced it must have been music
[58:28] he did and it pleased god
[58:31] he danced before the lord and it pleased
[58:33] the lord
[58:35] sometimes we message people we've gotten
[58:37] too stiff
[58:39] we need to get our out of our comfort
[58:41] zones a little bit
[58:42] amen
[58:44] don't be afraid to do a little dance for
[58:46] the lord
[58:47] but also do it in your prayer closet as
[58:49] well
[58:51] as brother brandon would do a little
[58:52] dance around the tree
[58:54] and tell the squirrel did you like that
[58:56] well
[58:57] watch this and he do it again
[58:59] there was nobody to watch him but there
[59:01] was a joy in his heart
[59:04] it set his feet to dancing amen
[59:07] and it'll do the same for you if you
[59:09] just open your heart
[59:11] and let that joy begin to move in your
[59:13] heart
[59:14] that's a that's one of the uh the the
[59:16] the fruits of the holy spirit is joy
[59:20] the joy of the lord is my strength
[59:24] we've gotten too stiff
[59:26] we've gotten too
[59:28] too orthodox i don't know what it is
[59:30] what the word for that is but you know
[59:32] we need to let loose a little bit
[59:35] and begin to praise god
[59:37] amen
[59:39] glory to god
[59:41] also in revelations
[59:43] we find
[59:44] that that they're singing
[59:46] we find revelations 5 8
[59:49] and when he had taken the book
[59:51] the four beasts and the 420 elders fell
[59:54] down before the lamb
[59:56] having every one of them harps and
[59:59] and golden vials full of orders
[1:00:02] which are the prayers of the saints
[1:00:04] they got slain of the spirit
[1:00:06] in the presence of the lord
[1:00:09] can you imagine this morning that i was
[1:00:11] i spoke for a little bit to the church
[1:00:12] we had no a visiting
[1:00:14] speaker but
[1:00:16] and i began to tell him you know that
[1:00:18] can you imagine when we stand that day
[1:00:19] before god
[1:00:21] when when after all this is over
[1:00:24] and we stand before the throne
[1:00:27] and all the angels are there
[1:00:30] as we stand on that glass you see before
[1:00:32] the throne of god
[1:00:34] and we get we begin to sing worthy
[1:00:36] islam
[1:00:38] that was slain
[1:00:40] worthy is the lamb that was slain
[1:00:43] hallelujah
[1:00:44] and we began to praise this is a song
[1:00:46] that says there's a song holy angels
[1:00:49] cannot sing
[1:00:51] amazing grace
[1:00:53] i once was lost
[1:00:55] but now i'm fouled
[1:00:57] they're not going to be able to join in
[1:00:59] they've never been lost they've never
[1:01:02] had anguish never had they never had
[1:01:05] a pain in their heart they never felt a
[1:01:07] separation of death they don't know what
[1:01:10] it is but we know what it is
[1:01:13] we know what it is to suffer shame
[1:01:16] we lived a life of shame before we came
[1:01:19] to the lord but he has taken our shame
[1:01:21] away
[1:01:23] and he took all the shame upon himself
[1:01:27] blessed be the name he is worthy to be
[1:01:29] praised
[1:01:31] he is worthy the lamb is worthy this
[1:01:33] evening hallelujah
[1:01:35] glory to god
[1:01:39] and he sang a new song saying thou art
[1:01:41] worthy
[1:01:42] to take the book and to open the seals
[1:01:44] thereof
[1:01:46] for thou was slain
[1:01:48] and has redeemed us hallelujah all the
[1:01:51] angels aren't going to be able to sing
[1:01:52] that
[1:01:54] as we sing that new song
[1:01:56] thou has redeemed us hallelujah
[1:01:59] thou has redeemed us to god by thy blood
[1:02:03] out of every kindred and tongue and
[1:02:06] people a nation
[1:02:08] and has made us unto our god-kings
[1:02:11] and priests
[1:02:13] glory be to god and we shall reign
[1:02:16] on the earth they sang a new song
[1:02:18] hallelujah we're going to sing a new
[1:02:21] song
[1:02:23] when we stand before him
[1:02:25] they'll be singing
[1:02:27] and they'll be praising in heaven
[1:02:29] if you can't sing in praise here you're
[1:02:32] going to feel out of place over there
[1:02:34] because it's going to be a lot of
[1:02:36] worship
[1:02:38] there's going to be a lot with 10 000
[1:02:40] years one song says and we'll just get
[1:02:42] started
[1:02:44] 10 000 years we've just begun the
[1:02:48] battle's over the victory is won 10 000
[1:02:52] years and we've just begun
[1:02:55] glory to god
[1:02:57] revelations chapter 14 verses 1 to 3.
[1:03:02] i want to establish something this
[1:03:05] evening first is that
[1:03:06] there is good worship
[1:03:08] there are good songs
[1:03:11] there are songs that brother green would
[1:03:12] say that are that are pleasing unto god
[1:03:17] brother green didn't like one song if
[1:03:18] you remember
[1:03:20] uh that song that says uh
[1:03:22] uh
[1:03:24] you can talk about me
[1:03:26] any way that you please
[1:03:28] you can talk a bit about me anyway and
[1:03:30] i'll talk to you about you
[1:03:32] down on my knees
[1:03:34] that sounds kind of holier than thou
[1:03:37] and it's true it's got a it's got a ring
[1:03:39] to it if you really examine it it's got
[1:03:40] a ring to it of holier than thou
[1:03:43] see i'm holier than you you can talk
[1:03:44] about me but i'm gonna talk to you about
[1:03:47] you on my knees to god
[1:03:49] and there's some some things the rest of
[1:03:51] the song is okay just that one verse
[1:03:54] but you know there are songs that are
[1:03:55] very pleasing to god
[1:03:58] i believe this song we sang i love him
[1:04:01] i love him
[1:04:03] for he first loved me
[1:04:05] amen
[1:04:07] he paid he paid the price for us
[1:04:10] he wants to hear us
[1:04:12] and i believe he does
[1:04:15] we were
[1:04:16] right after my daughter passed away
[1:04:18] uh
[1:04:19] we we got sick my wife and i and we were
[1:04:23] i would say we were at death's door
[1:04:25] and they just brought us back from the
[1:04:26] hospital my son bobby and my daughter
[1:04:28] elizabeth
[1:04:29] and they were they were taking care of
[1:04:31] us and we couldn't i could hardly walk
[1:04:33] up a step i was so weak
[1:04:35] i went down i lost i went down for 195
[1:04:38] to 150 pounds in weight
[1:04:40] and and so we were you know it was very
[1:04:42] very rough
[1:04:44] and uh
[1:04:46] and now if you were here at the memorial
[1:04:49] there was a song that jude my son-in-law
[1:04:52] saying
[1:04:52] levanto vismanos i lift up my hands lord
[1:04:56] i lift up my hands
[1:04:59] even though i have many problems
[1:05:01] i lifted my hands lord
[1:05:04] and
[1:05:05] and there was a there was a service we'd
[1:05:07] had in our church
[1:05:08] and the same brother who was here this
[1:05:10] morning
[1:05:11] brother hawu who preached to our church
[1:05:13] this morning
[1:05:14] had preached that morning and and he was
[1:05:16] going around with the i had i was
[1:05:19] leading the song service after that
[1:05:21] and we began to sing that song and the
[1:05:23] spirit of god just came down moved
[1:05:24] amongst us beautifully and my daughter
[1:05:27] had her hands up in the air and he got
[1:05:28] her own video
[1:05:30] and she's just praising god
[1:05:34] and we were there at the house fast
[1:05:36] forward when we're coming back from the
[1:05:38] hospital my wife and i are very sick
[1:05:40] and my son put put some music on and i
[1:05:43] don't know where he got it it was on
[1:05:45] youtube or whatever but the first song
[1:05:47] was levanto mismanus
[1:05:50] and he turned around and here we are my
[1:05:52] wife and i
[1:05:53] and and he was moved because my wife and
[1:05:56] i we as we were we were lifting up our
[1:05:58] hands
[1:06:00] right in the middle of that and
[1:06:01] you know i think god will look down at
[1:06:03] us sometimes and as he sees us going
[1:06:05] through all the hard times and all the
[1:06:08] the tremendous trials we have to go
[1:06:10] through
[1:06:11] and yet we can still praise him i think
[1:06:13] god will say
[1:06:14] angels will you just be quiet look at my
[1:06:16] son look at my daughter
[1:06:19] look at them look what they're going
[1:06:21] through yet they're praising me
[1:06:23] yet they're worshiping me yet they love
[1:06:26] me
[1:06:27] hey man
[1:06:29] that's what it's about
[1:06:30] to get into that spirit
[1:06:32] that doesn't matter what we go through
[1:06:34] in life
[1:06:35] doesn't matter what happens
[1:06:37] we can still worship him
[1:06:39] and praise him i remember when they
[1:06:41] brought me the news that night
[1:06:43] we had we were there at the we were
[1:06:45] there at bill elizabeth's house
[1:06:48] where they would they would put the
[1:06:49] camera on her
[1:06:51] though she was unconscious
[1:06:54] and
[1:06:54] believing that she could hear us
[1:06:56] we would pray to her sing to her
[1:06:59] and and and i forget what they call it
[1:07:01] face time or whatever something like
[1:07:04] that
[1:07:05] and uh
[1:07:06] that night it was a saturday night my
[1:07:08] wife and i were real tired we went home
[1:07:10] we saved for that
[1:07:12] and so we we expected we're going to
[1:07:14] just go home and go to bed that's it but
[1:07:16] late that night i was in my study and i
[1:07:18] was i think i was studying something for
[1:07:20] first sunday morning
[1:07:22] when the doorbell rang it was about
[1:07:24] nine ten o'clock at night and i said
[1:07:26] what would that be and so i went to the
[1:07:28] door and
[1:07:29] i opened it my son and
[1:07:32] my daughters were there and all the
[1:07:34] family and all the a lot of the
[1:07:35] grandchildren when i saw them i knew
[1:07:38] right there that she was gone
[1:07:40] and my son said the words to me he said
[1:07:42] she ain't suffering no more dead
[1:07:45] and remember i just cried out
[1:07:48] and in my anguish
[1:07:51] i remember saying
[1:07:53] the lord giveth
[1:07:55] the lord taketh
[1:07:57] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:00] what would cause a man who say something
[1:08:02] like that
[1:08:04] it's something that's deep in our hearts
[1:08:07] god places a word in our heart and his
[1:08:09] spirit
[1:08:11] and that's what responds when we can't
[1:08:12] respond he responds
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:16] glory to god exceed me for being
[1:08:18] emotional but when i talk about my
[1:08:20] daughter it just
[1:08:21] is so real
[1:08:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:27] and i heard verse 2 i heard the voice
[1:08:30] from heaven
[1:08:31] as the voice of many waters
[1:08:33] as a voice of a great thunder
[1:08:37] and i heard the voice of harper's
[1:08:39] harping them with their harps
[1:08:40] and they sung as it were
[1:08:42] a new song before the throne
[1:08:46] and before the
[1:08:47] four beasts and the elders no
[1:08:50] man could learn that song but the 144
[1:08:52] thousand which were redeemed from the
[1:08:54] earth
[1:08:55] you know i believe there was a no
[1:08:57] pentecostal meeting taking place there
[1:08:59] right there before there's gonna be
[1:09:02] before the throne of god there will be
[1:09:03] pentecostal meetings amen
[1:09:06] amen if you don't know what pentecostal
[1:09:08] is you'll find out
[1:09:10] amen if you're talking about these these
[1:09:12] uh out these these living creatures
[1:09:15] slaying there in in the presence of god
[1:09:17] amen
[1:09:18] and everybody's just singing and
[1:09:20] praising the lord
[1:09:22] in job 38-1
[1:09:25] the lord asked job he said where were
[1:09:26] you
[1:09:28] remember out of that he spoke out of
[1:09:30] that whirlwind
[1:09:32] he said where were you when the morning
[1:09:34] stars sang together
[1:09:37] hallelujah and all the sons of god
[1:09:40] shouted for joy
[1:09:42] there was a pentecostal meeting taking
[1:09:44] place there
[1:09:46] glory to god
[1:09:47] and you know pentecost is brother brown
[1:09:49] said it's not a denomination it's an
[1:09:51] experience
[1:09:53] hearing church is an experience
[1:09:55] it that's what it is you experience it
[1:09:58] you don't join it you don't go write
[1:10:00] your name on the book but you experience
[1:10:02] it
[1:10:03] it's the holy ghost and power and it's
[1:10:05] keeping me alive
[1:10:07] it's all over me and it's keeping me
[1:10:09] alive
[1:10:12] but as we said music has taken many
[1:10:14] forms
[1:10:16] some
[1:10:17] and many functions
[1:10:19] both sacred
[1:10:21] and profane
[1:10:24] in the message without money or without
[1:10:26] price
[1:10:27] 59 brother brown says some of you young
[1:10:29] people
[1:10:30] yeah that has wasted your living
[1:10:32] the hours that
[1:10:34] mother
[1:10:37] spent in prayer for you and dad all the
[1:10:39] teaching that has been done
[1:10:42] to you and you've turned it aside
[1:10:45] to listen to the whisper of the devil
[1:10:48] now you're desiring the music of the
[1:10:51] world
[1:10:52] the things
[1:10:54] of the world you young people listen to
[1:10:55] me
[1:10:57] at the request
[1:10:59] of
[1:11:00] of the seattle times
[1:11:02] there was a dr bernard sable
[1:11:05] a child guidance expert
[1:11:07] for the washington state division of
[1:11:09] community services
[1:11:11] attended a concert back in the 60s
[1:11:14] of the beatles
[1:11:16] after the performance he wrote
[1:11:18] the experience of being with 14 000
[1:11:22] teenagers
[1:11:23] to see the beatles is unbelievable
[1:11:26] and frightening
[1:11:28] the hysteria
[1:11:30] and loss of control
[1:11:32] so far beyond the impact of the music
[1:11:36] many of those present became frantic
[1:11:39] hostile uncontrolled
[1:11:41] screaming
[1:11:43] unrecognizable beings
[1:11:46] and this happens today in the concerts
[1:11:48] of the world
[1:11:50] this is not simply a release
[1:11:52] as i first thought it would be but a
[1:11:54] very destructive process
[1:11:58] and i've seen them on youtube i've seen
[1:11:59] where these concerts and all there would
[1:12:02] be thousands and all of them had their
[1:12:04] hands up like this
[1:12:07] what are they worshiping
[1:12:09] who are they worshiping
[1:12:11] and we come to church
[1:12:13] and we can't so much as lift up one hand
[1:12:17] to worship our god
[1:12:19] but if we were out there in the world
[1:12:20] with them we'd have both hands up
[1:12:23] going into frenzies
[1:12:25] as they do in the world
[1:12:28] normally unrecognizable girls behaved as
[1:12:32] possessed
[1:12:33] by some demonic
[1:12:35] urge
[1:12:36] define an emotional ecstasy
[1:12:39] the restraints which authorities and
[1:12:42] common sense
[1:12:43] would place on them
[1:12:46] a supernatural power
[1:12:49] is at work here
[1:12:51] his satanic majesty the devil
[1:12:55] is using these strange sounds
[1:12:58] the electric guitar
[1:13:00] the drum beat
[1:13:02] amen and then all the drugs is being
[1:13:05] used in the audience as they're
[1:13:06] listening to all this
[1:13:09] to captivate the senses
[1:13:11] and lead them into sin
[1:13:14] this use of continuous beating sounds
[1:13:18] as a medium is a as a medium for
[1:13:20] communication with evil spirits
[1:13:23] has has a long history
[1:13:27] i don't know if you've ever heard of any
[1:13:28] of these i'm gonna mention some people
[1:13:30] that are in the music industry there's
[1:13:32] one nicki minaj
[1:13:35] her performance although criticized
[1:13:39] created an intrigue
[1:13:41] and it kept her fans wanting to know
[1:13:43] what's next
[1:13:45] the pop star continues to feed into the
[1:13:48] buzz machine and has even gone so far as
[1:13:51] to explain that she believes a demon
[1:13:54] named roman lives inside of her
[1:13:58] those cultures that choose to access the
[1:14:01] domains of the spirit
[1:14:04] world have often used a form of
[1:14:06] rhythmically controlled noise
[1:14:09] to facilitate
[1:14:11] communion
[1:14:12] the shamans
[1:14:14] say they ride their drum
[1:14:16] to the world tree
[1:14:18] the classic possession cultures say that
[1:14:21] the orisha
[1:14:22] the ancestor spirits ride the rhythm of
[1:14:25] the drum
[1:14:26] down into the dancing bodies it is
[1:14:28] called the trance drum
[1:14:31] the path led from the east of africa to
[1:14:34] the shores of america
[1:14:36] it began with ragtime
[1:14:39] led to blues
[1:14:41] and then jazz
[1:14:43] later rock and roll
[1:14:45] and finally various forms of rock
[1:14:48] but it was the intensity of the drums
[1:14:52] which
[1:14:53] hurled it into the greatest shock attack
[1:14:57] on the souls of men
[1:14:59] men and women
[1:15:01] some scholars connect the west african
[1:15:04] possession cultures with the ancient
[1:15:06] neolothic neolithic mother goddess
[1:15:09] culture
[1:15:10] which over 3 000
[1:15:13] years ago
[1:15:14] stretched from eastern europe into what
[1:15:16] is now sahara desert sees nothing new
[1:15:18] about it it's been around for a long
[1:15:21] time
[1:15:22] when they came to america in those
[1:15:24] places where africans were allowed to
[1:15:27] keep their drums
[1:15:29] it mutated into can dumbly santeria
[1:15:33] voden
[1:15:34] in america where the drums were
[1:15:36] prohibited for many generations did you
[1:15:39] know that
[1:15:40] in many churches they wouldn't allow a
[1:15:42] drone
[1:15:44] this legacy of possession trans-danced
[1:15:47] rhythm became jazz rock and roll
[1:15:50] rock and then hard rock
[1:15:53] the importance of jazz
[1:15:56] as a contribution to modern music
[1:15:58] is a greatly debated question
[1:16:01] jazz is of course a stimulus coming from
[1:16:04] the primitive art according to carl neff
[1:16:06] an outline of the history of music
[1:16:09] the incessant
[1:16:11] monotonous drum beat
[1:16:14] was a key
[1:16:15] to reviving the possession cults of the
[1:16:18] east and africa in america
[1:16:21] from america through rock it has been
[1:16:23] carried around the world
[1:16:26] they used to use the drums in the
[1:16:28] jungles of africa
[1:16:30] to conjure up demons
[1:16:32] in the worship of satan
[1:16:35] having established that spirit
[1:16:37] possession
[1:16:39] does take place
[1:16:41] the possibility of the role of music and
[1:16:43] possession may be examined
[1:16:46] satan has always been highly involved
[1:16:49] with music
[1:16:50] beginning in heaven satan had led the
[1:16:53] heavenly choir
[1:16:56] think of it he was a song leader
[1:16:58] in heaven
[1:17:00] this suggested satan is the most
[1:17:02] intelligent being
[1:17:03] regarding music
[1:17:05] in our world he knows music
[1:17:08] he knows how to use it
[1:17:12] he knows how to make the best use of it
[1:17:15] to achieve
[1:17:16] his ends
[1:17:18] he does things with music that seems
[1:17:20] strange and even impossible
[1:17:24] the search of the use of music and devil
[1:17:26] possession
[1:17:27] resulted in finding two main avenues
[1:17:30] one is the use of beats in music to call
[1:17:33] the spirits or gods
[1:17:36] the other is the altered state of
[1:17:38] consciousness that comes through the
[1:17:40] drug
[1:17:41] that they use whatever it might be
[1:17:45] humanism
[1:17:46] the belief that man rather than god is a
[1:17:49] sum
[1:17:50] and measure
[1:17:52] of all things
[1:17:54] is one of the founding tenets of a faith
[1:17:56] called new age
[1:17:59] men a new age in the age of aquarius
[1:18:03] is anything but new
[1:18:06] the movement itself is older than
[1:18:08] hinduism and buddhism
[1:18:10] it is older than the oracles of ancient
[1:18:12] greece and egypt
[1:18:14] it is as old as a serpent in the garden
[1:18:17] of eden
[1:18:18] who beguiled eve
[1:18:21] with the words ye shall be as gods
[1:18:26] rock music is a product of a disoriented
[1:18:30] despairing
[1:18:31] drug related sex mad generation
[1:18:36] there's no question about that
[1:18:39] the first big rock singer was elvis
[1:18:41] presley
[1:18:42] who killed himself with drugs
[1:18:45] and he gave rise to the whole rock
[1:18:47] generation
[1:18:49] he was the first and his whole act was
[1:18:51] sexual and sensual
[1:18:54] when he played the first time i think of
[1:18:56] one of the
[1:18:57] national
[1:18:58] way back in the 50s
[1:19:01] they actually put the camera from his
[1:19:03] waist up because they considered what he
[1:19:05] was doing with the waist down was
[1:19:06] immoral
[1:19:07] and it would not show to the public
[1:19:12] in the message god keeps his word in 57
[1:19:14] brother branham says now i do not like
[1:19:16] to call people nate people's names but
[1:19:19] i'm going to have to call somebody's
[1:19:21] name now
[1:19:23] but i pray for the young man
[1:19:25] and i pray all the time for him but he
[1:19:28] is an instrument in the hands of the
[1:19:30] devil
[1:19:32] and that man is elvis presley
[1:19:35] the people are are gone boogie woogie
[1:19:37] and or rock and roll wild
[1:19:40] the american people is gone and they're
[1:19:42] trying by that same spirit to get the
[1:19:44] thing into the church
[1:19:47] i like church music played like church
[1:19:49] music
[1:19:51] but we had tonight that's church music
[1:19:54] amen
[1:19:56] and not rock and roll in the church
[1:19:58] but when they get these spirits there is
[1:20:00] something behind this listen to that now
[1:20:04] it's not something just innocent
[1:20:06] it's not just something that just
[1:20:07] happens
[1:20:08] but there's something behind it
[1:20:12] he says and the devil puts himself out a
[1:20:15] challenger
[1:20:17] and it happens to be that this poor
[1:20:19] backslidden pentecostal boy
[1:20:22] said the way he learned his maneuvers of
[1:20:24] jerking and shaking he caught it and
[1:20:26] learned it in the church
[1:20:29] he is a member of the first assemblies
[1:20:31] of god of memphis tennessee
[1:20:34] or he was
[1:20:36] his pastor is a friend of mine
[1:20:39] and he is the devil's instrument
[1:20:42] of deluding and polluting the minds
[1:20:47] of teenagers
[1:20:49] of getting them into a place
[1:20:51] until they just left
[1:20:53] just left a place in canada
[1:20:55] i think they sent 14 young people into
[1:20:57] the insane asylum a few days after he
[1:21:01] was there
[1:21:02] and all over the country but the people
[1:21:04] has gone wild
[1:21:06] frantically
[1:21:09] a man named robert plant and jimmy page
[1:21:12] of
[1:21:12] led zeppelin
[1:21:15] both claim that they don't know
[1:21:17] who wrote their occultic song
[1:21:19] stairway to heaven
[1:21:22] plant testified pagie had written the
[1:21:25] chords and played them for me i was
[1:21:28] holding the paper and pencil and for
[1:21:30] some reason i was in a very bad mood
[1:21:34] then all of a sudden my hand was writing
[1:21:36] out words
[1:21:37] i just sat there and looked at the words
[1:21:40] and then i almost leaped out of my seat
[1:21:43] where did that anointing come from
[1:21:47] where did it come from
[1:21:51] bill ward
[1:21:52] of black
[1:21:54] sabbath he says i've always considered
[1:21:58] that there was some way where we were
[1:22:00] able to channel energy
[1:22:02] and that energy was able to be from
[1:22:05] another source
[1:22:07] if you like like a higher power or
[1:22:09] something
[1:22:11] that was actually doing the work
[1:22:13] i've often thought of was just being
[1:22:15] actually just the earthly beings that
[1:22:17] played the music because it was uncanny
[1:22:20] some of this music came out extremely
[1:22:23] uncanny
[1:22:26] stevie nicks of fleetwood mac
[1:22:28] it's amazing
[1:22:30] because sometimes when we're on stage i
[1:22:32] feel like somebody's just moving the
[1:22:34] pieces
[1:22:35] i'm just going
[1:22:37] god we don't have any control over this
[1:22:40] and that's magic
[1:22:43] angus young
[1:22:44] lead guitarist for ac dc
[1:22:48] is called a guitar demon
[1:22:50] and he admitted that something takes
[1:22:52] control
[1:22:53] of the band during their concerts it's
[1:22:56] like i'm an automatic pilot
[1:22:58] by the time we're halfway through the
[1:23:00] first number someone else is steering me
[1:23:04] i'm just along for the ride
[1:23:07] i become possessed
[1:23:09] when i get on stage
[1:23:11] what is anointing these people
[1:23:14] little richard
[1:23:16] cited by charles white the life and
[1:23:18] times of little richard i was directed
[1:23:21] and commanded by another power
[1:23:23] the power of darkness
[1:23:26] see they can even recognize it
[1:23:29] like menage can say that that's a demon
[1:23:32] and he's got a name roman this man here
[1:23:34] is called it's a power of darkness
[1:23:37] that a lot of people don't believe
[1:23:39] exists
[1:23:41] and that's true
[1:23:42] they don't believe it exists but it's
[1:23:44] there
[1:23:46] the power
[1:23:47] of the devil satan
[1:23:50] jimi hendrix's girlfriend
[1:23:53] her name is payne or fayne pridgeon said
[1:23:56] he used to always talk about some devil
[1:23:59] or something was in him you know he he
[1:24:02] didn't know what made him act the way he
[1:24:04] acted and what made him say the things
[1:24:06] he said and the songs and different
[1:24:08] things like that just came out of him
[1:24:11] it seems to me he was so tormented
[1:24:14] and just torn apart
[1:24:16] and like he was really obsessed you know
[1:24:19] with something really evil
[1:24:22] my my my
[1:24:24] this is what the young people listen to
[1:24:25] every day
[1:24:27] now these are some of the older
[1:24:28] generation of rock and roll
[1:24:30] we're going to get into a few of the of
[1:24:32] the now ones and what they say
[1:24:37] mark stores vocalist for heavy metal
[1:24:40] band crocus
[1:24:41] you can't describe it playing rock music
[1:24:46] except to say it's like a mysterious
[1:24:48] energy that comes from the metaphysical
[1:24:51] plane and into my body
[1:24:53] it's almost like being a medium
[1:24:56] and you wonder what is transferred
[1:25:00] when they're on the platform
[1:25:02] and they're playing that music and those
[1:25:04] young people are there
[1:25:06] and they're taking drugs and they're and
[1:25:07] their minds are completely opened up
[1:25:11] what kind of demonic forces
[1:25:13] are coming off that platform
[1:25:16] into those people
[1:25:17] no wonder the world brother bran said to
[1:25:19] be a time when the whole world will be
[1:25:23] start raiding mad
[1:25:25] we see the madness all around us
[1:25:28] but it all starts back there with one
[1:25:31] man
[1:25:32] it starts back there in 1950s
[1:25:35] elvis presley
[1:25:36] and from there he just begins satan
[1:25:38] begins to use this tool
[1:25:41] because he was able to captivate the
[1:25:43] hearts and the souls of the young people
[1:25:46] and with you young people that are
[1:25:47] hearing rock and roll music and country
[1:25:50] music
[1:25:51] that is not the music you should be
[1:25:53] listening to because it opens up your
[1:25:56] spirit
[1:25:58] and when you open up your spirit you
[1:26:00] receive what that music has
[1:26:03] be very careful with music you listen to
[1:26:06] even some of this so-called christian
[1:26:09] music that's out there
[1:26:11] be very careful
[1:26:12] what you're allowing into your spirit
[1:26:16] amen we should stand guard
[1:26:18] your spirit is a womb the womb of your
[1:26:21] mind
[1:26:22] your mind is the womb of the spirit it's
[1:26:25] the gateway into your spirit and brother
[1:26:28] brown says at least right down into your
[1:26:30] soul
[1:26:31] and that's what satan wants
[1:26:33] he wants to destroy your soul
[1:26:38] john lennon
[1:26:40] i felt like a hollow temple
[1:26:43] filled
[1:26:44] with many spirits
[1:26:46] each one passing through me
[1:26:48] each inhabiting me for a little time and
[1:26:51] then leaving to be replaced by another
[1:26:57] michael jackson
[1:26:58] it happens subliminally
[1:27:01] it's the music that compels me to do it
[1:27:04] you don't think about it it just
[1:27:06] happens
[1:27:07] i'm a slave
[1:27:09] to the rhythm
[1:27:11] he was a slave to much more than that
[1:27:14] he killed himself with drugs as well
[1:27:24] david bowie of the rolling stones
[1:27:28] rock has always been
[1:27:29] listen to this what he says
[1:27:32] rock
[1:27:33] has always been
[1:27:35] the devil's music
[1:27:38] you can't convince me
[1:27:40] that it isn't
[1:27:41] i honestly believe everything i've said
[1:27:44] i believe rock and roll is dangerous
[1:27:48] let me tell you this this evening it's
[1:27:50] all that music
[1:27:52] we were talking about rock and hard rock
[1:27:54] and these things but there's i'm talking
[1:27:55] about a wide range of music
[1:27:58] that causes you to open up your spirit
[1:28:01] he says it's dangerous i feel that we're
[1:28:03] only heralding
[1:28:05] something even darker
[1:28:08] than ourselves
[1:28:11] in the end you have to look at the song
[1:28:14] and not know exactly where it came from
[1:28:17] that's brook
[1:28:18] bruce springsteed
[1:28:21] john mclaughlin leader of
[1:28:23] mayhem
[1:28:24] may have ishnu orchestra testified one
[1:28:28] night we were playing and suddenly the
[1:28:31] spirit entered into me and i was playing
[1:28:34] but it was no longer me playing
[1:28:37] judas
[1:28:38] glenn tipton of judas priest
[1:28:41] says i just go crazy when i go on stage
[1:28:44] it's like someone else takes over my
[1:28:47] body
[1:28:49] that's friends is called demon
[1:28:52] possession
[1:28:55] that is what's being conveyed
[1:28:58] to all the young people out there
[1:29:00] in the world
[1:29:04] beyonce
[1:29:06] this is her testimony
[1:29:09] right before i be performed for the bet
[1:29:11] awards
[1:29:13] i raised my hands up
[1:29:15] and it was the first time i felt
[1:29:16] something
[1:29:17] else come into me
[1:29:20] you know my daughter i gave this
[1:29:22] testimony sister faye goodspeed was
[1:29:25] leading the choir
[1:29:26] many years ago
[1:29:28] and the choir was just it filled up the
[1:29:29] whole platform here i was back there on
[1:29:32] the
[1:29:33] larry and i would interpret for the
[1:29:35] hispanic people
[1:29:36] and my daughter was standing somewhere
[1:29:38] over here
[1:29:40] when the holy spirit just moved in this
[1:29:43] congregation
[1:29:44] and all those young people began to
[1:29:45] raise up their hands
[1:29:48] my daughter told me later that day she
[1:29:49] said daddy something came unto me
[1:29:53] when i was up there
[1:29:55] and i knew it was the holy spirit
[1:29:58] that's what we want to come into us
[1:30:00] jesus said when we come to the lord
[1:30:04] and we hear the word of god for the
[1:30:06] first time
[1:30:08] we you know maybe you came to an altar
[1:30:10] or something and
[1:30:11] you you just gave your heart to god
[1:30:13] and the word came and and the atmosphere
[1:30:16] causes just like king saul those spirits
[1:30:18] have to leave
[1:30:20] when you walk out of here you feel like
[1:30:21] you're just walking on air anybody ever
[1:30:23] felt that
[1:30:26] brother brandon said you know that
[1:30:28] you know that's a danger to me it's the
[1:30:30] most dangerous time
[1:30:31] in the believer's life
[1:30:34] because brother brown says you know gee
[1:30:35] equals jesus that spirit leaves and goes
[1:30:38] out wandering into high places and dry
[1:30:40] places
[1:30:41] looking for a house to live in because
[1:30:43] you're a house
[1:30:44] you're a dwelling place
[1:30:47] uh beyonce is a dwelling place my
[1:30:50] daughter was a dwelling police
[1:30:52] and then and and jesus said when he
[1:30:55] doesn't find a place he remembers his
[1:30:57] old house
[1:30:59] i'm gonna go check it out see what's
[1:31:00] going on well you know what brother
[1:31:02] brown said he comes back he finds that
[1:31:04] house cleaned and
[1:31:06] cleaned out
[1:31:08] and coming to church praising the lord
[1:31:11] just on it on fire for god
[1:31:13] he says but empty
[1:31:16] that is the most dangerous time
[1:31:19] when you empty out
[1:31:22] because you need to be filled
[1:31:25] and if you're not filled with the holy
[1:31:27] spirit you'll be filled with something
[1:31:29] else
[1:31:30] and when that spirit goes and gets seven
[1:31:33] spirits worse
[1:31:35] it comes to make to abide in that person
[1:31:38] and his latter state is worse than he
[1:31:40] was before
[1:31:43] because then so maybe a religious spirit
[1:31:45] gets a hold
[1:31:46] that's one of the worst spirits we could
[1:31:48] ever get a hold of
[1:31:50] because you look you can't identify it
[1:31:53] in yourself
[1:31:54] if you have a spirit of lust or a spirit
[1:31:56] of stealing or lying or whatever it
[1:31:59] might be you can identify it you know it
[1:32:02] but when you get a religious spirit
[1:32:04] you can't identify it
[1:32:06] you think you're all right
[1:32:08] when you're not
[1:32:10] and that time when that person empties
[1:32:13] out
[1:32:15] and walks around
[1:32:17] praising god just having a good time in
[1:32:18] the lord
[1:32:19] but brother brown says empty
[1:32:22] empty
[1:32:23] don't stay empty don't stay empty
[1:32:28] many times
[1:32:30] we go through the processes
[1:32:33] and then the time comes
[1:32:35] an evangelist comes
[1:32:37] you run to the altar again and you empty
[1:32:39] out again
[1:32:41] and then you just go through the same
[1:32:43] motions again
[1:32:44] you don't get filled with the holy ghost
[1:32:47] and then your condition becomes worse
[1:32:49] than ever
[1:32:51] it can happen again and again and again
[1:32:55] you need to have the baptism of the holy
[1:32:58] ghost
[1:32:59] there's nothing more important you've
[1:33:01] got to get filled
[1:33:02] you need to have this house dwelled
[1:33:05] know you not that you are a temple if
[1:33:08] paul said what don't you know
[1:33:10] you're a temple of the holy ghost
[1:33:13] you don't belong to yourself
[1:33:15] you belong to god
[1:33:17] oh god help us you young people
[1:33:20] you ever come to the altar and empty out
[1:33:22] you stay there do you get filled with
[1:33:24] the holy ghost
[1:33:25] make sure you're a dwelling place of the
[1:33:27] most high
[1:33:28] make sure your
[1:33:30] god is living in you
[1:33:32] amen
[1:33:33] that'll keep you through all the things
[1:33:35] that will come in later on in life amen
[1:33:41] blessed be his name
[1:33:49] i felt something come in to me she says
[1:33:52] i knew it was going to be my coming out
[1:33:54] night
[1:33:55] at the awards show
[1:33:57] beyonce is one of the most powerful
[1:33:58] influencers of adults and children alike
[1:34:01] however many people
[1:34:04] don't know
[1:34:05] that she has admitted countless times
[1:34:08] that she is possessed
[1:34:10] by a spirit guide she named
[1:34:12] sasha fierce
[1:34:14] beyonce is just one of many celebrities
[1:34:17] who is working on behalf of satan
[1:34:20] and encouraging us to follow and
[1:34:22] practice
[1:34:24] luciferianism
[1:34:26] it's that serious
[1:34:28] katy perry britney spears fergie nicki
[1:34:31] minaj lady gaga justin timberlake
[1:34:35] kanye west jay-z
[1:34:36] are some of the other more well-known
[1:34:39] professing satanists
[1:34:41] for example fergie states the devil
[1:34:44] comes and soon my conscious and
[1:34:46] unconscious might start to brawl as this
[1:34:49] cunning demon takes me as is voodoo doll
[1:34:53] katy perry explains i swear i wanted to
[1:34:56] be the amy grant of music
[1:34:59] but it didn't work out so i sold my soul
[1:35:02] to the devil
[1:35:04] nicki minaj said in the past that
[1:35:06] there's a crazy boy named roman
[1:35:08] justin timberlake
[1:35:10] boastfully announced
[1:35:13] you people out there
[1:35:16] satan is my master
[1:35:18] he always has been
[1:35:20] these are the people these young people
[1:35:22] are worshiping and adoring
[1:35:25] they're listening to them their lives is
[1:35:28] a is is is what they want to mimic
[1:35:33] and it doesn't go just for music as well
[1:35:35] it's entertainment all entertainment
[1:35:39] here's a quote from
[1:35:41] robin williams
[1:35:43] who by the way hung himself
[1:35:46] if you ever seen robin williams
[1:35:49] when he when he's doing an act
[1:35:53] he he sounds like about 15 different
[1:35:56] people
[1:35:57] just real quick
[1:35:58] and i've always seen i said this guy
[1:36:00] he's got a he's got a he's got a legion
[1:36:02] in him
[1:36:04] and look what he says yeah literally
[1:36:07] it's like possession
[1:36:09] all of a sudden you're in and you just
[1:36:11] get this energy that gets going but
[1:36:14] there's also that thing it is possession
[1:36:17] is dr jekyll and mr hyde where you can
[1:36:20] really become this other force
[1:36:23] he hung himself one day
[1:36:25] that's where it led him
[1:36:27] that's where he led michael jackson
[1:36:28] that's where he led albus presley
[1:36:31] many of those artists have died by by
[1:36:35] addictions and overdoses and everything
[1:36:37] else and suicides
[1:36:40] because that's where it would lead you
[1:36:43] first corinthians 3 16 says know ye not
[1:36:46] that you are the temple of god
[1:36:50] and that the spirit of god dwelleth in
[1:36:52] you
[1:36:55] they've got something else dwelling in
[1:36:57] them
[1:36:58] and all those young people
[1:37:00] that are there raising their hands and
[1:37:02] getting into the spirit
[1:37:05] and we come to church and we can't get
[1:37:07] into the spirit
[1:37:12] we miss the boat
[1:37:15] if any man defile the temple of god
[1:37:18] him shall god destroy
[1:37:21] for the temple of god is holy
[1:37:25] which temple ye are
[1:37:28] hear me young people
[1:37:30] be careful what you're listening to be
[1:37:32] careful what you're opening up your
[1:37:34] spirit to
[1:37:37] first corinthians 6 19 what
[1:37:39] knowing not that your body is a temple
[1:37:41] of the holy ghost which is in you
[1:37:44] which ye have of god
[1:37:45] and ye are not your own
[1:37:50] we know that satan
[1:37:52] was the anointed cherub
[1:37:55] ezekiel 28 14.
[1:37:57] he was adorned with every precious jewel
[1:38:01] imaginable
[1:38:03] ezekiel 28 13.
[1:38:05] he was a model of perfection
[1:38:09] full of wisdom
[1:38:10] and perfect in beauty
[1:38:13] ezekiel 28 12. and likely he was the
[1:38:17] highest and we know he was
[1:38:19] brother brown said that he was almost
[1:38:21] like co-worker with god
[1:38:23] he stood right next to god
[1:38:28] in isaiah 14 and 12
[1:38:30] give me just a few more minutes and i'll
[1:38:31] be done
[1:38:34] it says speaking of satan
[1:38:36] how are thou fallen
[1:38:39] from heaven or lucifer
[1:38:41] son of the morning
[1:38:43] how
[1:38:44] are thou cut down to the ground
[1:38:47] which did weaken the nations
[1:38:50] for thou has said in thine heart listen
[1:38:53] to his
[1:38:54] his words i want you to listen to that
[1:38:56] one time i
[1:38:57] my son bobby
[1:39:00] he was about six or seven years old he'd
[1:39:02] come out of
[1:39:03] sunday school
[1:39:04] one morning and
[1:39:06] he says to me daddy
[1:39:08] i said yes son
[1:39:10] he said you know satan had an eye
[1:39:11] problem
[1:39:14] he had an eye i didn't catch it
[1:39:16] an eye problem
[1:39:19] he had that he had an eye problem
[1:39:22] if you listen to these scriptures you'll
[1:39:23] know
[1:39:24] why thou has said in thine heart i
[1:39:29] will ascend into heaven
[1:39:31] i
[1:39:32] will exalt my throne
[1:39:34] above the stars of god
[1:39:37] i
[1:39:38] will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:39:41] congregation in the sides of the north i
[1:39:44] will ascend from the heights of the
[1:39:47] clouds i
[1:39:49] will be like the most high
[1:39:52] yet thou shall be brought down to hell
[1:39:56] to the sides of the pit

[1:41:42] that this where did this man get this

[1:42:51] a song written by kiss
[1:42:54] from the album destroyer
[1:42:57] kiss i believe stands for kings in
[1:43:01] satan's service
[1:43:03] at the beginning of the song there is a
[1:43:05] sound of little children shouting
[1:43:08] i don't want to go to that place
[1:43:11] then the singer begins to howl
[1:43:13] his deadly message
[1:43:15] i'm the lord of the wasteland
[1:43:19] i gather darkness to please me
[1:43:22] and i command you to kneel
[1:43:25] before me
[1:43:26] god of thunder
[1:43:28] and of rock and roll
[1:43:29] the spell
[1:43:31] you're under
[1:43:33] will
[1:43:34] slowly rob you
[1:43:36] of your virgin soul
[1:43:40] the lyrics of a song sung by the rock
[1:43:42] group black sabbath
[1:43:45] now i have you with me
[1:43:48] under my power
[1:43:50] our love grows stronger
[1:43:53] with every hour
[1:43:55] look at my eyes
[1:43:57] and you'll see who i am
[1:43:59] my name
[1:44:01] is lucifer
[1:44:03] please take my hand
[1:44:07] in time as
[1:44:08] men developed
[1:44:10] their artistic abilities
[1:44:14] music began to take on many forms
[1:44:18] as i said before the sacred
[1:44:21] that we covered this evening
[1:44:23] and also the profane
[1:44:26] this is what is being
[1:44:28] used in the world today and too many
[1:44:31] christians
[1:44:33] are allowing themselves to be drawn
[1:44:36] by that music
[1:44:38] there was a time i could remember in my
[1:44:40] in my day
[1:44:42] that elevator music was just
[1:44:44] a violin or a little organ or something
[1:44:46] but it came to a place back in the 80s
[1:44:49] you'd walk into an elevator and
[1:44:51] it'd be rock and roll it'd be beatles
[1:44:53] music
[1:44:54] you walk into a restaurant now it's all
[1:44:56] hard rock and rock and roll
[1:44:58] anywhere you go you go into a grocery
[1:45:00] store listen to the music
[1:45:03] we're being bombarded by that
[1:45:05] everywhere we go
[1:45:07] because there's a spirit behind it
[1:45:09] brother brown said
[1:45:10] there's there's something behind that
[1:45:13] we have to guard ourselves guard our
[1:45:16] minds
[1:45:18] be careful what we're digesting through
[1:45:20] our
[1:45:21] our mind into our heart because this is
[1:45:23] the womb of our spirit
[1:45:25] and that's where satan this is where the
[1:45:27] battle takes place it's a battlefield of
[1:45:29] the mind
[1:45:30] and satan wants that
[1:45:33] once he gets that he'll find his way
[1:45:35] into your soul
[1:45:37] amen
[1:45:39] and i close tonight
[1:45:41] ephesians chapter 5 verse 15
[1:45:44] see then
[1:45:45] that ye walk
[1:45:47] circumspectly
[1:45:49] not as fools
[1:45:51] but as wise
[1:45:53] redeeming the time
[1:45:56] because of days are evil
[1:45:59] if we're liv if we if there's ever been
[1:46:01] an evil day
[1:46:03] this is that day
[1:46:06] we sing the song there's never been a
[1:46:08] day like this day
[1:46:10] but if we see the holy spirit coming to
[1:46:14] to
[1:46:15] to fill us with his goodness and his
[1:46:17] word the revealed word of the hour we
[1:46:20] see the world being taken over
[1:46:23] by
[1:46:24] satan
[1:46:26] wherefore be not unwise
[1:46:29] but understanding
[1:46:31] what the will of the lord is
[1:46:34] and be not drunk with wine
[1:46:38] where in his excess but be filled
[1:46:41] with a spirit
[1:46:43] speaking to yourselves in psalms
[1:46:46] and hymns
[1:46:47] and spiritual songs
[1:46:50] singing
[1:46:51] and making melody in your heart
[1:46:54] to the lord
[1:46:56] giving thanks always for all the things
[1:47:00] for all things unto god
[1:47:02] and the father
[1:47:03] in the name
[1:47:04] of our lord jesus christ
[1:47:07] one more scripture colossians 3 16-17
[1:47:10] let the word of christ dwell in you
[1:47:12] richly in all wisdom
[1:47:15] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:47:17] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:47:21] singing with grace in your hearts to the
[1:47:23] lord and whatsoever you do in word or
[1:47:25] deed

[1:48:53] i was preaching something similar to
[1:48:55] this
[1:48:56] probably 25 years ago
[1:48:59] in nogales
[1:49:01] it happened that morning
[1:49:03] i i was scheduled to preach that morning
[1:49:05] and
[1:49:07] brother gustavo
[1:49:08] reese is a pastor
[1:49:11] and our van drove up
[1:49:12] the house of brother lived there sort of
[1:49:14] the church
[1:49:15] and his brother jerry amelong was
[1:49:17] driving the van
[1:49:19] and his wife
[1:49:21] and then they opened the side door and
[1:49:23] brother billy paul and his wife
[1:49:26] a brother from canada his wife and two
[1:49:28] teenage daughters stepped out
[1:49:31] and i was struggling during that time it
[1:49:32] was about
[1:49:33] back in the mid 90s
[1:49:36] i was struggling with with whether i
[1:49:38] should be preaching or not
[1:49:40] because the lord called me late in life
[1:49:41] i was 42 years old
[1:49:44] and i was struggling with that and i had
[1:49:46] pretty much made up my mind i was like
[1:49:47] tell brother green don't
[1:49:49] don't call me no more brother i just
[1:49:50] don't want to do this
[1:49:53] i had an experience before that and
[1:49:54] that's why i was feeling that way and
[1:49:57] and i was pretty much making up my mind
[1:49:59] that i was gonna quit but i made this
[1:50:01] brother a promise that i was gonna
[1:50:02] and back in thanksgiving that i would
[1:50:04] preach for him in january
[1:50:06] and he called me every weekend are you
[1:50:08] preaching this you coming this weekend
[1:50:09] no brother next weekend next week and
[1:50:11] next weekend
[1:50:12] the last weekend came and i knew i had
[1:50:14] to keep my promise
[1:50:16] i believe in keeping my promises as much
[1:50:17] as i can
[1:50:19] you know the bible says you know that
[1:50:21] that your
[1:50:22] your your testimony ba and amen and
[1:50:25] brother bryan says that man's only good
[1:50:26] is his word
[1:50:28] so i said i'll it's the last week and
[1:50:29] it's all gold so i went not because i
[1:50:31] wanted to be there
[1:50:33] when i see that
[1:50:35] that van pulled up and brought billy
[1:50:36] paul i turned to the pastor as a brother
[1:50:39] if you want to preach this morning
[1:50:40] brother that's fine with me
[1:50:42] you got some
[1:50:43] some you know some
[1:50:45] really special guests here and
[1:50:47] you know no no brother you're gonna
[1:50:49] preach
[1:50:52] you know and
[1:50:53] i don't know brother brandon said the
[1:50:54] ones that are unwieldy the ones he calls
[1:50:57] then there's all the ones that say they
[1:50:58] salivate for the for the pulpit
[1:51:01] you got to be careful about that
[1:51:03] but i didn't want i didn't want to do
[1:51:05] this and
[1:51:07] and so
[1:51:09] i asked them well what did they well ask
[1:51:11] brother jerry he preaches
[1:51:13] i went i asked brother jerry brother you
[1:51:14] got a message you want to preach this
[1:51:15] morning no no i'm just going to give a
[1:51:17] testimony
[1:51:19] i went to the
[1:51:21] that other brother i think he was a
[1:51:22] minister
[1:51:23] no i don't know i'm just gonna greet the
[1:51:25] people
[1:51:26] i went back to the pastor and said no
[1:51:28] they don't want to i guess you're gonna
[1:51:29] preach he said
[1:51:31] well that that that morning
[1:51:33] i don't know if you've ever been in a
[1:51:35] mexican church but they're made out of
[1:51:36] concrete it was february
[1:51:39] it was january the last weekend of
[1:51:41] january and it's cold in the galas
[1:51:44] and and those
[1:51:45] churches made out of concrete with
[1:51:46] concrete ceilings and concrete was like
[1:51:49] a it's like a ice box
[1:51:51] my feet were so cold that i sat back
[1:51:53] there in the office
[1:51:55] when they finally all they prayed and
[1:51:56] they went out into the platform to start
[1:51:58] the service and because they saw brother
[1:52:00] billy paul everybody wanted to sing a
[1:52:02] song
[1:52:03] and i sat there lord forgive me lord
[1:52:05] i don't want to ever go behind that
[1:52:07] pulpit unless you're with me
[1:52:09] that for an hour and a half i sat back
[1:52:11] there
[1:52:13] i looked at the doorway going out to the
[1:52:14] outside and i thought well
[1:52:16] my car is blocked in my wife is sitting
[1:52:19] among how am i going to get her out of
[1:52:20] the congress i all this went through my
[1:52:22] mind
[1:52:23] i did not want to be there
[1:52:25] and i said lord help me and i began to
[1:52:28] ask god forgive me
[1:52:31] for thinking that i was something
[1:52:33] i'd been to a service about a month
[1:52:34] before that or no it was back in before
[1:52:37] thanksgiving
[1:52:39] and i never preached outside of here
[1:52:42] and he invited me and i went to preach
[1:52:44] over there and
[1:52:45] i preached sunday morning
[1:52:47] the token
[1:52:48] and then that night
[1:52:50] i preached the little sermon the brother
[1:52:51] shelley preacher many years ago
[1:52:54] one more night with the frogs
[1:52:56] and
[1:52:57] that that i of course i preached in my
[1:52:59] own way but i used that as as
[1:53:02] as my
[1:53:03] my scripture
[1:53:05] where
[1:53:06] you know pharaoh came to moses he said
[1:53:09] take these frogs away
[1:53:11] get him out
[1:53:13] and
[1:53:14] moses asked him what shall i ask lord
[1:53:16] when to remove him
[1:53:17] he said tomorrow
[1:53:20] and the question is
[1:53:21] why
[1:53:22] did he say tomorrow
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:26] you know a frog
[1:53:28] is a type of an evil spirit
[1:53:31] many times
[1:53:33] god will call you
[1:53:34] in your heart
[1:53:36] and you'll say no
[1:53:38] i'm okay and you're gonna spend another
[1:53:41] night with that frog
[1:53:43] that evil spirit
[1:53:45] that's that's bothering you
[1:53:47] just trying to destroy your life
[1:53:50] when you could have come
[1:53:51] to the altar
[1:53:53] you could have come for prayer to be
[1:53:54] delivered of it
[1:53:56] that's what church is all about friends
[1:53:58] it's not just a place to come and just
[1:54:00] show off that you're a christian but
[1:54:02] it's a place to to be delivered it's a
[1:54:05] place to receive the baptism of the holy
[1:54:07] ghost it's a place to be saved for your
[1:54:10] children to be saved for the for the for
[1:54:13] the
[1:54:13] for the the atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:54:16] to charge the air all around us that'll
[1:54:20] change the lives of people
[1:54:23] and that's what that's what that
[1:54:24] preaching was that night and that night
[1:54:26] the power of god i never had never as a
[1:54:28] minister had experienced that
[1:54:31] there were probably about 150 people in
[1:54:33] that church that
[1:54:34] night and the power of god came down
[1:54:38] and people ran to the altar the whole
[1:54:40] church ran to the altar
[1:54:43] remember i stood there people were just
[1:54:44] screaming and crying out to god and
[1:54:47] that was the first time i went to that
[1:54:48] church
[1:54:50] i remember i turned around and brother
[1:54:52] the pastor was on his knees and his arms
[1:54:55] up in the air just crying out to god
[1:54:58] and a thought came to my heart i didn't
[1:55:00] say it but it was there my heart and god
[1:55:01] knows god knows your heart you can hide
[1:55:04] it all you want but he knows your heart
[1:55:07] and i thought that's pretty good robert
[1:55:09] did pretty good
[1:55:11] you're good
[1:55:14] that was in my heart
[1:55:16] well god gave me a time to repent
[1:55:19] and i sat back there in that icebox back
[1:55:21] there that office
[1:55:23] while every brother went up there to
[1:55:25] give their testimony and everybody
[1:55:27] wanted to sing for an hour and a half i
[1:55:29] cried out unto god
[1:55:31] when i stepped out into that pulpit
[1:55:34] i was anointed
[1:55:36] and i remember i stood behind the pulpit
[1:55:38] and
[1:55:39] just to kind of give a little bit of
[1:55:40] myself i
[1:55:42] i told brother buddy paul and many of
[1:55:43] you know that my parents were in the
[1:55:46] healing line
[1:55:47] 57 with brother branham and i was healed
[1:55:49] and 55
[1:55:51] myself as a little child
[1:55:54] my uncle was healed my grandmother was
[1:55:56] healed by brother bran's prayers
[1:56:00] through different manners for the
[1:56:01] handkerchief
[1:56:02] through the healing line
[1:56:04] through a personal
[1:56:06] interview with brother branham
[1:56:08] healings took place in my family
[1:56:10] and
[1:56:12] and i kind of just gave a little bit
[1:56:14] about
[1:56:15] phoenix
[1:56:16] and so brother billy paul would know
[1:56:18] about that and i tried to go spanish to
[1:56:21] english for their benefit but
[1:56:23] the anointing got a hold of me and at
[1:56:25] the end of the service the reason i'm
[1:56:26] bringing this is because at the end of
[1:56:28] the service i touched on a little bit on
[1:56:30] this
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:33] and
[1:56:34] not knowing
[1:56:35] when i finished the power of god came
[1:56:38] down
[1:56:40] in that service
[1:56:42] the young people ran to the altar
[1:56:45] they've been fighting that spirit
[1:56:48] and they were delivered
[1:56:50] our gods just swept through the whole
[1:56:51] congregation
[1:56:53] i was getting ready i was i wanted to
[1:56:55] quit
[1:56:57] we went to
[1:56:58] have lunch after that
[1:56:59] billy paul he told us some wonderful
[1:57:01] testimonies
[1:57:02] when it was all said and done
[1:57:05] i had gone to the bathroom and there was
[1:57:07] about 15 people at that table
[1:57:09] and i came back everybody had already
[1:57:10] gotten up there walking out
[1:57:12] and i just found myself just i was the
[1:57:14] last one walking out
[1:57:17] and brother billy paul was in front of
[1:57:18] me
[1:57:20] and
[1:57:21] he was we're the last ones i don't know
[1:57:23] he just worked out that way
[1:57:25] brother billy paul stopped he turned
[1:57:27] around says brother robert
[1:57:30] he says you want to tell you something
[1:57:33] he says that was the holy spirit
[1:57:35] this morning
[1:57:36] i know the holy spirit
[1:57:38] and that was the holy spirit
[1:57:41] and he said there was a young man
[1:57:43] standing in front of me and
[1:57:46] he was sobbing and crying
[1:57:48] and you said something and he literally
[1:57:50] fell over his chair on the floor
[1:57:53] he said that was a holy ghost
[1:57:55] and i've often thought about that why
[1:57:57] did brother billy paul do that why did
[1:57:58] he tell me that he didn't know why but i
[1:58:01] was struggling
[1:58:03] he couldn't god could have sent anybody
[1:58:04] else in the entire planet
[1:58:07] that would have made a bigger difference
[1:58:08] because i seen brother billy paul stand
[1:58:10] back there
[1:58:11] when his father is under the anointing
[1:58:13] of god
[1:58:15] barely can stand he's getting the bible
[1:58:18] and he's holding his father
[1:58:20] in the very presence of that angel
[1:58:22] how many times did brother billy paul
[1:58:24] experience that
[1:58:26] brother man would say that don't don't
[1:58:28] fear that now
[1:58:30] that's that's that's his presence
[1:58:32] people would come up to him
[1:58:33] they felt that presence
[1:58:35] there was nobody in the whole planet
[1:58:38] that would have had more impact on my
[1:58:39] life
[1:58:41] than brother billy paul to tell me that
[1:58:43] god sent him
[1:58:45] how i put that weekend the next week and
[1:58:47] next weekend it was all planned by god
[1:58:50] like brother green would say if if you
[1:58:51] could write the script
[1:58:54] you know every one of us has got a
[1:58:55] script
[1:58:57] you can look at in your life and say
[1:58:58] yeah i know it was god
[1:59:01] i know it was god
[1:59:03] you know we could say well
[1:59:05] satan will get you all bothered and all
[1:59:08] tore up and
[1:59:10] that you're nobody
[1:59:12] you failed god and he's right he's the
[1:59:14] accuser see if you were a child of god
[1:59:17] you wouldn't have done that
[1:59:19] you wanted that you wouldn't have said
[1:59:20] what you said
[1:59:22] he's right there is he not
[1:59:25] and we could sit down and just have a
[1:59:26] little pity party and say oh poor me
[1:59:29] i thought i was a child of god
[1:59:32] i thought i belonged to god
[1:59:35] or we could begin to remember what god
[1:59:37] says
[1:59:39] for as many years are led by the spirit
[1:59:41] of god they are the sons of god
[1:59:44] amen
[1:59:46] and you begin to remember how god led
[1:59:48] you
[1:59:49] all that time he came on the scene for
[1:59:52] me that time that this happened and that
[1:59:55] happened and he began to realize how god
[1:59:57] is leading you
[2:00:00] brother green said that brother man
[2:00:02] stood up in that church today one day
[2:00:03] and he said i'm so glad that brother
[2:00:05] perry and sister janice green
[2:00:08] followed the leadership of the holy
[2:00:09] spirit to come start this church and
[2:00:12] brother green you remember what he said
[2:00:14] is that what i did
[2:00:16] yes
[2:00:17] is god leading you who guided you
[2:00:19] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[2:00:22] god they are the sons of god
[2:00:25] the only
[2:00:28] real peace
[2:00:29] that i have
[2:00:32] dear lord is
