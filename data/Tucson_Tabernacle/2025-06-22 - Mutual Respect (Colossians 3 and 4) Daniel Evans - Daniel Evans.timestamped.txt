[11:26] Oh Lord my God,
[11:31] when I in awome
[11:35] wonder
[11:38] consider
[11:40] all
[11:42] the world thy hands have made.
[11:48] Yes, Jesus. I see the stars.
[11:53] [Music]
[11:55] I hear the rolling

[14:37] Is that the song of your soul this
[14:38] morning? the recognition of how great he
[14:42] is and yet he dwells within each one of
[14:47] us.
[14:49] Oh my,
[14:52] we have a a number of uh of requests
[14:55] here this morning that I'd just like to
[14:57] share with you.
[14:59] Sister Esther says, "Brethren, please
[15:01] pray for me. I had a dentist procedure
[15:04] that infected and I have lots of pain. I
[15:07] ask for complete healing
[15:11] from Sister Grace. Pray for brother
[15:13] Steven Figareroa. I've been sick all
[15:15] week with a cold or flu.
[15:20] A request from Sister Jacqueline. My son
[15:22] is suffering discouragement because he
[15:25] isn't making enough income to sustain
[15:26] his expenses.
[15:28] The lawsuit is still pending and
[15:30] ongoing, which is very stressful. I
[15:33] don't know if any of you ever had a a
[15:35] lawsuit pending against you. I remember
[15:37] many years ago I had one and it uh it it
[15:40] certainly caused a lot of stress. Please
[15:42] pray that he will have some relief and
[15:46] some sustainable income. Thank you for
[15:48] your prayers. May God bless you.
[15:51] A prayer request from brother Justin
[15:53] Badgely. Please remember sister Lori Row
[15:56] in prayer. She is experiencing severe
[15:58] neck pain due to a pinched nerve and may
[16:01] require surgery for more complex
[16:03] structural issues. She wears a neck
[16:05] brace twice a day is having difficulty
[16:07] moving her arms. She had an MRI
[16:09] yesterday is asking the Lord for
[16:11] complete healing and relief.
[16:14] [Music]
[16:15] And a request from our pastor Daniel.
[16:19] Please pray for two dear friends of
[16:20] mine. They're at a crossroads in their
[16:23] lives and will be making decisions that
[16:25] will affect their future, possibly their
[16:29] eternal destinations.
[16:31] They need the wisdom of the Holy Spirit.
[16:37] And I can't help but think this morning
[16:39] about the bombing that took place in
[16:42] Iran last night and the war that's going
[16:45] on in the Middle East right now and all
[16:48] these situations. And a lot of times we
[16:50] think, well, what does this mean or what
[16:51] does that mean or what is this a sign
[16:53] of? But you know, Paul responded to all
[16:56] those things in his letter to the
[16:58] Corinthians when he said, "Knowledge
[17:00] will fail, prophecy will cease, though I
[17:03] speak with tongues of men and angels."
[17:04] The important thing, the important thing
[17:08] is that we have love one for another. We
[17:11] have love for our Lord and that
[17:13] expresses itself in our love, our
[17:15] cooperation, our support, our sincerity
[17:19] with each of us. And if we have that,
[17:21] then it doesn't matter which bombs are
[17:23] falling. It doesn't matter what's going
[17:26] on. We have to keep him the center of
[17:28] our life. And with that thought, let's
[17:30] join our hearts together over these
[17:32] needs are they're very important. They
[17:34] wouldn't have been submitted. if they
[17:36] weren't important and if the people
[17:37] submitting them did not have confidence
[17:40] in the Holy Spirit moving and living in
[17:42] each one of us to bring it to the
[17:44] attention of the throne that the Lord
[17:46] would intervene and do his perfect will
[17:49] in all of these situations. Lord Jesus,
[17:53] we're so grateful.
[17:56] We're so humbled, Lord, that we can call
[17:59] upon your name,
[18:01] Lord, that you have chosen to allow us
[18:04] to worship you this morning. You've
[18:05] given us a place where we can come by
[18:08] choice to be here, to be together, Lord,
[18:12] to worship you, to hear your word, Lord,
[18:15] to strengthen it within us, Lord, and to
[18:17] draw us ever closer to you and to one
[18:19] another. I pray for your anointing on
[18:21] our pastor Daniel this morning as he
[18:24] brings the word from the letter that
[18:26] your servant Paul wrote to the church in
[18:29] Colasse, a place that he had never been,
[18:32] people he had never met, but the burden
[18:34] was on his heart because of that love
[18:36] that you placed there. Lord, we just
[18:39] pray again that you would draw us closer
[18:41] to one another and to yourself. Forgive
[18:43] us where we fall short. Lord, help us,
[18:46] Lord. Help us. And Lord, as offering is
[18:49] taken this morning, we pray that it
[18:50] would be used for the purposes that you
[18:52] intend for the furtherance of the
[18:54] kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we
[18:57] thank you in that precious name. Amen.
[19:04] Just before you pass the offering, I'm
[19:05] going to have everybody shake hands with
[19:07] each other. I didn't have you do that. I
[19:09] thought maybe there'd be some folks come
[19:10] in and so I held off. Shake each other's
[19:14] hands.
[19:18] When I think of the goodness of Jesus,
[19:52] When I think of the goodness of Jesus
[19:58] and all he has done for me,
[20:04] my soul cries out, "How Hallelujah.
[20:09] Praise God for saving me. You can all
[20:14] have your seats. Oh, when I think of the
[20:17] goodness of Jesus
[20:21] and all he has done for me.
[20:27] My soul cries out, hallelujah.
[20:33] Praise God for saving me. Let's sing
[20:37] that again. Oh, when I think of the
[20:41] goodness of Jesus
[20:45] and all he has done in my life.
[20:50] My soul cries out, hallelujah.
[20:56] Praise God for saving me. One more time.
[21:01] Yes. When I think of the goodness of
[21:05] Jesus
[21:08] and all he has done my life,
[21:13] my soul cries out, hallelujah.
[21:19] Praise God for saving me.
[21:25] Praise him. Praise the Lord. You can
[21:27] give the Lord a hand clap of praise this
[21:29] morning.
[21:33] Key of F. I heard an old old story. How
[21:36] a savior came from glory.
[21:39] [Music]
[21:43] I heard an old old story.
[21:47] How a savior came from glory.
[21:52] how he gave his life on Calvary
[21:56] to save a wretch like me.
[22:01] I heard about his groaning
[22:05] of his precious blood
[22:08] atoning
[22:10] and I repented of my sins and won the
[22:16] victory.
[22:19] Oh, victory
[22:21] in Jesus
[22:23] my savior
[22:26] forever.
[22:28] He sought me and he bought me with his
[22:34] redeeing blood.
[22:37] He loved me. I knew him and all my love
[22:44] is to him. He plunged me to victory
[22:50] beneath the cleansing flood. I heard
[22:53] about his healing. I heard about his
[22:57] healing
[22:59] of his cleansing power revealing.
[23:03] How he made the lame to walk again and
[23:08] cause the blind to see.
[23:12] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
[23:16] come and heal my broken
[23:19] spirit."
[23:21] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[23:26] the victory.
[23:30] Oh, victory
[23:32] in Jesus
[23:34] my savior
[23:36] forever.
[23:38] He sought me and he bought me with his
[23:44] redeeming blood.
[23:47] He loved me air. I knew him and all my
[23:53] love is to him. He plunged me to victory
[24:00] beneath the cleansing the last verse.
[24:04] And I heard about a manship
[24:09] he has built for me in glory.
[24:14] And I heard about the streets of gold
[24:18] beyond the crystal sea.
[24:22] And about the angels singing
[24:27] and the old redemption
[24:29] story. Yes.
[24:31] And some sweet day I'll sing up there
[24:35] the song of victory.
[24:40] Oh victory
[24:42] in Jesus
[24:44] my savior
[24:47] forever.
[24:49] He sought me and he bought me with his
[24:54] redeeming blood.
[24:57] He loved me air. I knew him.
[25:02] All my love is due to him.
[25:06] He plunged me to victory
[25:11] beneath the cleansing. One more time.
[25:13] Victory.
[25:15] Oh, victory
[25:17] in Jesus
[25:19] my savior
[25:21] forever.
[25:24] He sought me and he bought me with his
[25:29] redeeming blood.
[25:32] He loved me here. I knew him and all my
[25:38] love is through him. He plunged me to
[25:44] victory
[25:45] beneath the cleansing flood.
[25:51] Amen.
[25:55] As brother Daniel gets ready to come,
[25:57] let's sing uh He's God, Bflat.

[26:04] Jordan,

[26:17] him glory this morning. Give him praise.

[26:23] to come out and preach with liberty what
[26:25] the Lord has laid on his heart. Sing
[26:27] this together.

[26:34] I humble
[26:36] myself.

[29:58] just your greatness and your glory.
[30:04] Lord, as we come here this morning,
[30:09] Father, I just feel this heaviness in my
[30:12] heart that I really believe
[30:16] that you're here with us and grateful
[30:19] for your presence.
[30:21] Father, I pray that
[30:24] you accept
[30:25] our worship this morning in both song
[30:28] and in reading of your word and in
[30:32] prayer.
[30:34] And Lord, that you would answer the
[30:37] prayers of those that are here this
[30:39] morning.
[30:40] Father, there are surely many things
[30:42] that they have need of. We all have need
[30:45] of. And I pray that you would answer
[30:46] those things. We ask these things in

[33:10] Yes, he's the name above all names.
[33:18] Worthy of our praise.
[33:23] And my heart will sing, how great
[33:28] is our God. He's the name above all
[33:31] names.
[33:33] He's the name above all names.
[33:41] worthy of our praise.
[33:46] And my heart will sing. How great
[33:51] is our God.
[33:55] Yes. How great
[33:59] is our God.
[34:02] Oh, sing with me. How great is our God.
[34:08] And all will see how great
[34:12] how great
[34:14] is our God.
[34:19] He's great.
[34:22] He's great.
[34:25] Ah, he he's great. He is just He's
[34:30] wonderful. Praise God. You can be
[34:32] seated. God bless you all.
[34:36] Lily, welcome home. It's good to have
[34:38] you back. God bless you.
[34:44] Wow. I uh you know, Daniel sometimes he
[34:46] gets up here when he's leading worship
[34:48] and he says,
[34:50] "I just woke up in a great mood this
[34:52] morning. I I just
[34:56] I'm just thankful. I'm just happy." And
[34:58] you know, I woke up this morning
[35:02] and I am just in awe of God and in awe
[35:07] of Christ.
[35:09] Just the life that he lived and
[35:13] everything that about him is just
[35:17] it's perfect. He was tempted in all
[35:19] things, the Bible said, yet without sin.
[35:22] No one that has ever lived on earth
[35:25] could ever say that. that they were
[35:27] tempted in all things. We're all tempted
[35:29] in many things. He was tempted in all
[35:31] things and yet never sinned. That's a
[35:35] man.
[35:36] That is a man that
[35:39] I will follow. That's a man that I love.
[35:43] He's And not only is he a man that I
[35:46] love that lived 2,000 years ago, he is a
[35:48] man that rose from the dead and is alive
[35:50] today.
[35:52] Him and him alone,
[35:54] he's great.
[35:56] We sing that song, how great is our God.
[35:59] Jesus Christ is God.
[36:02] He was I am just I'm so blessed. I'm
[36:06] just blessed this morning. I sorry I'm
[36:08] emotional. I'm not usually like this. I
[36:10] I just God thank you. Thank you for your
[36:14] goodness. Brother Lyle as for the prayer
[36:17] requests and of course I do want to
[36:21] always mention what's going on in the
[36:22] Middle East and and of course we're on
[36:26] Israel's side. You know, I believe
[36:28] that's God's it's God's
[36:31] apple of his eye. It's God's with him.
[36:34] But there are also people living in
[36:37] neighborhoods with missiles flying over
[36:38] their heads, missiles landing in their
[36:41] own neighborhoods that are some very
[36:44] fine people. Some of the finest people
[36:46] that I've met in my travels have been
[36:48] Persian people, those from Iran. They
[36:51] are not they get a bad representation
[36:54] from the wararm mongers and the
[36:56] craziness that is their leaders in Iran.
[36:58] the the people, the Persian people and
[37:01] the Jewish people have loved each other
[37:03] for for centuries. From Cyrus when he
[37:08] came and he he released all of the Jews
[37:11] to to leave Babylon and go back home,
[37:14] that was a Persian man.
[37:17] And his descendants now live in the same
[37:20] place in this country of Iran. And as I
[37:23] said, they're very on the whole, they're
[37:26] one of the finest people I've ever met.
[37:30] So always remember whoever God's
[37:32] children are. We remember the Jewish
[37:35] people, but we also remember the Gentile
[37:37] people and and the people that love God.
[37:41] Um
[37:42] I uh I believe this morning is is timely
[37:48] in getting to the end of the book of
[37:50] Colossians.
[37:52] just with just our lives and the way
[37:57] that we live our lives. I really believe
[37:59] that the Lord had ordained us to go
[38:03] through and to get to this the end of
[38:06] this third chapter in Colossians today.
[38:09] I uh
[38:11] I want to be in the same spirit as Paul
[38:14] was when he wrote it.
[38:17] And it's all about really it's all about
[38:20] this man that we were just singing
[38:22] praises to this man Jesus Christ.
[38:26] I was just in my study this morning and
[38:31] thinking about how great Jesus was.
[38:38] He didn't just teach like I will teach
[38:42] and I'll do my best to live what I
[38:44] teach.
[38:46] Jesus
[38:48] lived everything that he taught. He was
[38:52] the example to us. I think how how great
[38:58] this man was. He he said, "You've heard
[39:01] the law and it says punish punishment
[39:03] must be matched by injury. An eye for an
[39:06] eye and a tooth for a tooth."
[39:09] And he says, "But I say don't resist an
[39:12] evil person. If someone slaps you on the
[39:15] right cheek, offer the other cheek also.
[39:19] If you're sued in court, your shirt is
[39:21] taken from you, give them your coat,
[39:22] too. If a soldier demands that you carry
[39:25] his gear for a mile, carry it two miles.
[39:29] We've been Stephanie and I just
[39:31] finished. We just got caught up to date
[39:32] on The Chosen. And there is one of the
[39:35] best scenes in that entire series of
[39:39] when the uh the soldiers were were
[39:42] making fun of the of Jesus and his
[39:44] disciples and and putting their helmets
[39:47] on them and and and just kind of beating
[39:49] him around a little bit and they they
[39:51] forced uh Jesus and his disciples. They
[39:54] said, "Hey, carry our gear for this
[39:56] mile." So, so they they go up there and
[39:59] and they're they're ridiculing them and
[40:01] they're walking and and there's Jesus in
[40:03] this Roman soldier uh helmet and and you
[40:06] think, man, if that was if I was there,
[40:09] I'd have taken out those Roman soldiers.
[40:11] I'd have fought for him. But no, they
[40:13] just walked along. And then they get to
[40:16] what the law required, what the law, the
[40:19] extent of the law, which was about a
[40:20] mile or so. And they said, "Okay, well,
[40:23] you can take off the stuff now." And
[40:24] Jesus says, "No,
[40:26] we want to carry it all the way."
[40:30] And the soldier looked at him like,
[40:33] "What are what are you doing?"
[40:35] And he said, "No,
[40:37] we'll carry your gear even though they
[40:40] were ridiculed, made fun of. We're going
[40:43] to continue to carry your stuff even
[40:46] though you may be our enemy." He lived
[40:50] that what he preached. He said, "Give to
[40:53] those who ask and don't turn away from
[40:54] those who want to borrow." You have
[40:56] heard the law says, "Love your neighbor
[40:57] and hate your enemy." But I say, "Love
[40:59] your enemies.
[41:02] Pray for those who persecute you." Pray
[41:05] for those who persecute you.
[41:09] In that way, you will be acting as true
[41:11] children of the father in heaven. For he
[41:14] gives light both to the evil and the
[41:16] good, and he sends rain on the just and
[41:18] the unjust. If you love only those who
[41:21] love you, that reward, what reward is
[41:22] there in that?
[41:25] Even the sinner, even the tax
[41:26] collectors, the publicans, they do the
[41:28] same.
[41:31] If you are kind only to your friends,
[41:33] how are you different from anyone else?
[41:36] Even pagans do that.
[41:39] But you are to be perfect
[41:42] even as your father in heaven is
[41:44] perfect. If you forgive those who sin
[41:46] against you, your heavenly father will
[41:48] forgive you.
[41:50] But if you refuse to forgive others,
[41:51] your father will not forgive your sins.
[41:55] Don't store up treasures here on earth
[41:57] where moths eat them and rust destroys
[41:59] them and where thieves break in and
[42:01] steal. Store your treasures in heaven
[42:03] where moths and rust cannot destroy and
[42:06] thieves do not break in and steal.
[42:08] Wherever your treasure is, there the
[42:10] desires of your heart will also be.
[42:13] Don't judge others and you will not be
[42:16] judged.
[42:18] for you will be treated as as you treat
[42:20] others. The standard you use in judging
[42:23] is the standard by which you will be
[42:24] judged.
[42:26] Let that sink in because I'm going to be
[42:28] talking about that in this book of
[42:29] Colossians.
[42:31] And why worry about a speck in your
[42:32] friend's eye
[42:37] when you have a long you have a log in
[42:39] your own eye? Why a beam in your own
[42:42] eye? when you can't let me help you get
[42:46] rid of that speck in your eye when you
[42:47] can't see past the log in your own eye.
[42:50] Then he says, "Hypocrite,
[42:53] first get rid of the log in your own
[42:55] eye. Then you will see well enough to
[42:57] deal with the speck in your friend's
[42:58] eye. Do others whatever you would like
[43:01] them to do to you."
[43:04] This is the essence of all that is
[43:06] taught in the law and the prophets. In
[43:08] this all of the law and the prophets
[43:10] lies.
[43:12] You can you can enter into into God's
[43:14] kingdom only through the narrow gate.
[43:17] The highway to hell is broad
[43:20] and the gate is wide for many who choose
[43:23] that way. But the gateway to life is
[43:28] narrow.
[43:29] The road is difficult and few there will
[43:31] be that find it. King James says,
[43:32] "Straight is the gate and narrow is the
[43:35] way and few there will be that find it."
[43:39] And then he said, "If you love me," he
[43:42] said, "keep my commandments."
[43:46] And this is the essence
[43:48] of the letters from all the apostles.
[43:51] These are the teachings of Jesus. We
[43:54] always want to blow it up into some
[43:57] fantastic thing and and take the focus
[44:00] off of Christ, but it always points us
[44:04] to one thing. In this book of
[44:06] Colossians, Ephesians,
[44:09] all the gospels, it always points us to
[44:11] love.
[44:12] That is the main thing. That is the big
[44:15] thing. And Jesus showed that love.
[44:19] Jesus didn't just get up here and
[44:22] preach.
[44:23] Jesus did it. He fellowshipped with what
[44:26] the church would call sinners.
[44:29] Those were his people.
[44:32] He didn't lift himself up above them.
[44:34] They were poor. just regular old normal
[44:38] people. Jesus wasn't better than them.
[44:41] He didn't act better than them. He was
[44:42] God with them.
[44:45] He loved his enemies
[44:47] even to the very end of his life out
[44:49] there on the c cross crying out to God,
[44:52] Lord, forgive them. Father, forgive them
[44:55] for they don't know what they're doing.
[44:58] We always hear practice what you preach.
[45:00] He practiced what he preached. And how
[45:02] many people really do that today?
[45:04] How many people that call themselves
[45:06] Christians really follow what Jesus
[45:09] followed what Jesus said and he actually
[45:11] did it?
[45:14] They took his garments and they cast
[45:16] lots for him
[45:18] on the same day they stripped him naked.
[45:22] And on the same day, that same day that
[45:25] they took his garment, set him up in
[45:28] front of the people naked, embarrassed,
[45:31] that same day he died for those very
[45:33] people,
[45:35] crying out on the cross for them. Thank
[45:37] you, Lord. He wasn't a businessman. He
[45:39] didn't have money. He stored up his
[45:41] treasures in heaven in the form of
[45:44] bloodwashed souls. You know what? I'm
[45:47] one of those souls.
[45:56] You know, and you you can see why
[45:59] everything in the Bible points to that
[46:01] man.
[46:03] It's all about him because of what he
[46:06] did and the life that he lived and
[46:08] everything about him was perfection. And
[46:11] then he said, "Now you do these things.
[46:14] Straight is the gate and narrow is way
[46:16] and few that'll be that find it. But if
[46:18] you just do these things, if you love
[46:20] me, just keep my commandments.
[46:22] And when we get into these scriptures
[46:25] and and when we're reading these
[46:26] epistles, we need to be in the same
[46:29] spirit that they wrote them. Don't just
[46:31] read them. It's like, okay, I should do
[46:33] this. I shouldn't do this. Why did they
[46:35] write these things? Why did the Apostle
[46:37] Paul write the book to the the the
[46:40] letter to the Colossians? Why did he say
[46:42] what he did? He said what he did?
[46:44] Because he was pointing to Christ. He
[46:46] was just he was just bringing out what
[46:48] Jesus had already said. And he was
[46:50] saying, "Now apply it to your lives."
[46:54] When we want to get to the bottom of the
[46:56] scriptures, they're really they're all
[46:57] saying the same thing. They all point us
[46:59] to Christ and then they say, "Now you do
[47:01] the same." You know, you've heard
[47:05] sometimes you heard that's the spirit.
[47:07] That's the spirit. you know, when you're
[47:08] trying to encourage someone or the
[47:11] spirit is the Holy Spirit. And that is
[47:14] the same spirit that I want to be in
[47:16] when I read the Bible.
[47:19] I want to truly know what it means. And
[47:22] it's not just
[47:25] it's not at all. It's not what the
[47:26] scripture means to you.
[47:29] All right? Let me make myself plain.
[47:32] It's not what the scripture means to
[47:34] you. It's what the scripture means.
[47:38] And if you mean something else to you,
[47:42] brother and sister, you are not the
[47:44] sovereign God. I am not the sovereign
[47:46] God. We have to understand what he is
[47:48] saying. We have to get in that same
[47:51] spirit because you can take a scripture
[47:53] and take it and and make it mean
[47:55] something completely opposite of what it
[47:57] really means.
[48:00] It is what the scripture means, not what
[48:02] it means to you. when we have Bible
[48:03] studies, I might ask, well, what does it
[48:06] mean to you?
[48:09] But really, it doesn't matter what it
[48:11] means to us. What matters is that we get
[48:14] the real meaning behind it. And that's
[48:16] what this this book, this whole Bible,
[48:20] it's really about. I was talking to
[48:22] somebody the other day, a couple days
[48:24] ago, who had questions about
[48:26] Christianity.
[48:28] and uh a scientist and and very
[48:31] intellectual in his thinking and he
[48:34] quoted a few things from the Bible and
[48:35] he said like the the earth was created
[48:37] in six days and and he says you know we
[48:40] know that's that's not true. We can
[48:42] prove that and he doesn't understand
[48:44] also why God would create mankind
[48:48] and then allow mankind to suffer and sin
[48:52] and all these problems. He said, "Why
[48:53] didn't God," he says, "if there was
[48:55] really a God, why didn't he just create
[48:56] him perfect and then why didn't he just
[48:58] make heaven so he could get to that
[49:00] place and have all this joy that you're
[49:02] talking about, why did he have to go
[49:04] through all put man through all these
[49:06] things?" He said, "It just doesn't make
[49:07] sense to me." My answer was, "The Bible
[49:10] says that God's thoughts are higher than
[49:13] our thoughts. His ways are higher than
[49:14] our ways. Our thoughts are not his
[49:17] thoughts. He knows better than we know,
[49:20] you know." And I I I appreciate and I
[49:23] told him I said the Bible was not
[49:25] written to be a science book.
[49:29] I said there's science in there. There's
[49:30] good science, but there it wasn't
[49:32] written for that purpose. And then I
[49:34] told them some of my publications that I
[49:36] that I have written, I said, I wrote
[49:38] them for this purpose and not for
[49:40] something else. And I said, neither is
[49:42] it written really to be a history book.
[49:44] There's good history in there, but it's
[49:46] not written for that either.
[49:48] I said the first parts of the Bible, the
[49:51] first few verses are just laying the
[49:54] foundation of who God is. He's this
[49:56] eternal being that has all control of
[49:58] everything and then he creates
[50:00] everything. He is he is the the
[50:03] omnipotent God. And then the rest of the
[50:07] Bible,
[50:08] the rest of it, maybe you got a half of
[50:12] one page, then the rest of it is about a
[50:16] relationship between that God, that
[50:18] creator, and his children, us. That's
[50:22] what the Bible's about. It's a book
[50:24] about a relationship. You know what?
[50:26] It's a love story. It really is. It's a
[50:30] love story between a bridegroom
[50:33] and a bride.
[50:36] And it's all about that.
[50:39] And it's just it's it's beautiful. I
[50:43] asked him, I said, "If if you were an
[50:46] eternal being,
[50:48] if you were God," I said, "What would be
[50:50] the first thing you do?" He said, "Well,
[50:51] I'd correct all the wrongs." I said,
[50:52] "No, no, no. There's no wrongs. It's
[50:54] just you in a vacuum. You're just God,
[50:57] and you're all by yourself. what would
[50:59] you do? He's like, "Well, I'd create
[51:04] friends. I'd create a world." Like,
[51:05] yeah, that's what he did.
[51:10] And I said, "And then what would happen
[51:12] if you
[51:15] see
[51:16] that this
[51:18] creation that you made starts to corrupt
[51:21] itself,
[51:22] starts to have problems?" I said, "What
[51:24] would you do?" He said, "Well, I'd fix
[51:26] it." I said, ' That's what he did.
[51:30] He fixed it. He didn't just wipe it
[51:33] clean,
[51:34] destroy it all.
[51:37] He fixed it. He sent salvation. He sent
[51:43] his son to fix it all. And that's where
[51:47] we're at today. It's it's I want to be
[51:51] in that spirit
[51:54] understanding what was written by these
[51:56] apostles and what is written in this
[51:58] Bible so I know the original meaning. I
[52:01] don't want to know something false. I
[52:02] don't want to believe something false. I
[52:04] want to understand it. I want to grab a
[52:06] hold. It's like this is why Paul said
[52:08] this. This is why Jesus said this. This
[52:11] is why they said it. So I can fully I
[52:14] can get closer to God. And that's what
[52:15] we need to do when we're reading the
[52:17] Bible. We don't just read it to say,
[52:20] "Well, you're wrong because you did
[52:22] this."
[52:24] Jesus, I just read where Jesus said, "If
[52:27] you judge that way, you're going to be
[52:28] judged in the same way." Believe me, God
[52:30] can point his finger down at me or any
[52:33] of you and show how much more wrong we
[52:37] have done to him than somebody's done to
[52:40] you or somebody's done to me. That's a
[52:43] fact. Wow. So, in this Colossians,
[52:46] Paul is writing to this church at
[52:49] Colasse. It's a group of people that, as
[52:52] brother Lyall said at the beginning,
[52:53] that he had never met. There's four
[52:56] chapters in all. And uh we'll get as far
[53:00] as we can this morning and I'll finish
[53:01] tonight. And it's divided really into
[53:04] two divisions. Chapters one and two. And
[53:07] then the second division is chapters
[53:09] three and four. The first two are about
[53:11] the are about the supremacy of Christ
[53:14] where it says that he is the fullness of
[53:16] the godhead bodily. He is the express
[53:18] image of God. He is the firstborn from
[53:20] the dead. All things were created by him
[53:22] and for him. And basically he's God.
[53:25] This man Jesus, he is supreme over
[53:28] everything.
[53:30] And then in chapter two,
[53:34] Paul starts preaching. He starts against
[53:36] legalism and also against some of the
[53:39] doctrines that may have come in maybe
[53:41] not necessarily from the Jews. The
[53:43] legalism probably came from the Jews but
[53:45] other doctrines ca that that he was
[53:47] either came into the church or or Paul
[53:49] was protecting he was preempting these
[53:51] things for coming into the church that
[53:53] saying that you just have to live your
[53:55] life for yourself and you have to do
[53:57] what's best for yourself.
[53:59] And then the second half, he's applying
[54:03] what he said to our personal lives.
[54:07] He's basically saying, submit to
[54:10] Christ's teachings. Take the teachings
[54:12] of Jesus and apply them to yourself.
[54:16] First part of chapter 3, we talked about
[54:18] applying the teachings of Christ and and
[54:21] how we die to ourselves and we die to
[54:23] our world, die to the world, and we are
[54:26] hidden with Christ in God.
[54:29] We talked about the correction Paul
[54:31] gives telling the audience to stay away
[54:33] from premarital sex from dirty living.
[54:35] He says put away anger and wrath and
[54:37] malice and talking in ways that are not
[54:40] becoming to Christians.
[54:43] Then Paul removes
[54:45] the classes and this was um
[54:49] groundbreaking really. The Apostle Paul
[54:52] removes the classes that had been always
[54:56] really since history started that was
[55:00] between the Jews and the Greeks, the
[55:02] barbarians and slave and free. He says,
[55:05] "Listen,
[55:06] listen. Doesn't matter what way race you
[55:08] are. Doesn't matter if you're from high
[55:11] society or low society. Doesn't matter
[55:13] if if you're a barbarian, if you're an
[55:15] idol worshipper, whatever. Whatever. We
[55:18] are all the same in Christ. And I
[55:21] imagine he probably got a lot of
[55:23] criticism for that.
[55:25] It's really we had the civil rights
[55:28] movement in the United States in the 60s
[55:30] and and and
[55:33] it it was it was that was great.
[55:36] But the Bible was for civil rights way
[55:40] back thousands of years ago. So if we
[55:44] would have just if people would just
[55:45] follow the Bible, there would have been
[55:47] no slavery. They would have got rid of
[55:48] slavery. They would have everyone would
[55:50] have loved each other regardless of
[55:52] their skin color or anything else about
[55:54] it. If we would just read the Bible,
[55:56] we'd see say that God loves us all and
[55:59] he doesn't prefer one over the other.
[56:02] Then um he tells us to encourage each
[56:05] other with godly music. And I talked
[56:07] about how the enemy last week has used
[56:09] music to draw people to darkness rather
[56:13] than Christ. And then I closed with the
[56:16] same scripture I closed with um a few
[56:19] weeks ago with Colossians 3:17. And
[56:22] whatsoever you do in word or deed to all
[56:25] in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
[56:26] thanks to God and the Father by him.
[56:28] That's a scripture, friends, that we can
[56:30] live our lives by. That has the answer
[56:32] to every question. Can I do this?
[56:34] Whatever it is, can I do this in the
[56:36] name of Jesus Christ? Does Jesus want me
[56:38] to do this? If he does, then do it. If
[56:42] he doesn't, then don't do it. So, we
[56:44] should be focusing on does Jesus want
[56:47] this and not do I want this.
[56:51] Now, the theme this morning
[56:54] um with the remaining part of Colossians
[56:56] 3 and 4 is mutual respect.
[57:01] And I had in my notes, mutual respect
[57:03] among believers.
[57:06] But as I think about it, that doesn't
[57:09] line up with the scriptures. It doesn't
[57:11] line up with what Jesus says. It is
[57:13] really just mutual respect.
[57:17] And whether they're a believer or not,
[57:19] that doesn't have anything to do with
[57:21] you. You respect everyone. and you'll
[57:25] see that this
[57:28] this teaching of Paul should be applied
[57:30] to our everyday lives. I was on a flight
[57:33] yesterday um or day before yesterday and
[57:35] I was coming home. I I was flying from
[57:38] Phoenix to Tucson. It was the last leg
[57:39] of my flight. And there was this I I was
[57:42] going back and there's this little old
[57:45] man, little skinny little guy. And he
[57:49] looked like he was a hundred, but he was
[57:51] definitely over 80 and probably up into
[57:56] his 90s. And and I sat down next to him
[57:58] and and he was the funniest little guy.
[58:03] and uh started talking with him and and
[58:06] immediately he starts cussing
[58:08] and uh he's like, "Yeah." And then he he
[58:11] starts telling me about what he drinks
[58:14] and what he smokes and and uh all of
[58:18] these different stories that that I
[58:21] thought were funny. So, I finally said,
[58:23] "Uh, I'm a pastor."
[58:27] And he goes, "Oh."
[58:30] He goes, "Okay." Um yeah. And he says,
[58:33] he says, "I used to go to church." He
[58:35] says, "But uh you know that what was
[58:37] that?" He says, "The um that uh that
[58:39] thing that happened that made all the
[58:41] people stay home." I said, "Cov." He
[58:44] goes, "Yeah, that." He says, "That's
[58:46] when I stopped going to church." I said,
[58:47] "So, you went before that?" He goes,
[58:49] "Well,
[58:51] um
[58:52] yeah, I I did, but I haven't gone since
[58:54] then." I was like, "Did you go before
[58:56] then?"
[58:57] So, we're talking a little bit more and
[59:02] he would tell me a story
[59:05] and
[59:07] he's my elder and I respected him for
[59:10] that war veteran, war hero and I believe
[59:14] he was in the the um he was in Vietnam
[59:17] and he was also believe in Korea
[59:20] fighting for our freedom
[59:24] and I respected that and my respect for
[59:28] him drew him in to me. And he gets on
[59:32] his phone and he would say, he was
[59:35] looking through his pictures. Oh yeah.
[59:37] And he show me a picture and it was like
[59:38] a picture of a scorpion. He says, "I
[59:40] found that." Oh yeah. It was a picture
[59:42] of a rattlesnake and then was a picture
[59:46] of other things. And as we talked, it
[59:50] wasn't like I was preaching to him. I
[59:51] was just showing him respect.
[59:54] and he
[59:57] started talking about the Lord and he
[1:00:01] said started saying, you know, I know
[1:00:02] God's real and this wasn't any prompting
[1:00:05] from me. He was doing all the talking
[1:00:07] and by the end of the flight, which was
[1:00:09] like, I don't know, 40 minutes. He was
[1:00:13] promising me that he's going to go back
[1:00:15] to church and he's from Benson, Sister
[1:00:18] Hope. He's where Sister Hope lives. He
[1:00:21] he's from down there. And he's like,
[1:00:22] he's like, "Yeah." He says, he says, you
[1:00:24] know, he says, God's good. He says, when
[1:00:26] the when the when the wheels went up,
[1:00:27] and I he told me a city, I think it was
[1:00:29] in it was in Korea. He says, when the
[1:00:32] wheels went up, he said, all I said was,
[1:00:36] "Thank you, God, that that I'm safe and
[1:00:39] I'm going home, going out of the war."
[1:00:40] And he goes, he looks at me, he goes,
[1:00:42] "Thank you, Jesus."
[1:00:45] I didn't say anything, but what I did is
[1:00:48] I gave him respect
[1:00:51] because he he he is my elder. And that
[1:00:54] respect
[1:00:56] for some reason drew him to the Lord.
[1:00:59] And I believe he left that day
[1:01:02] fully intent on going back to church and
[1:01:05] and rekindling maybe an old relationship
[1:01:08] that he had.
[1:01:10] Uh let's start with Colossians 3. Let's
[1:01:14] start with verse 12. I've read this
[1:01:16] before. We'll just go over it, but I
[1:01:19] think this this builds a context for
[1:01:20] what we're about to say. Put on
[1:01:22] therefore as the elect of God, holy and
[1:01:24] beloved, bows of mercies, kindness,
[1:01:26] humbleness of mind, meekness,
[1:01:29] longsuffering, forebearing one another,
[1:01:31] and forgiving one another. Remember
[1:01:34] Jesus's words, forbearing one another
[1:01:37] and forgiving one another. If any man
[1:01:39] have a quarrel against any, even as
[1:01:42] Christ forgave you, so also do ye.
[1:01:48] You hear so many times, well, he did me
[1:01:50] wrong. She did me wrong. We talk about
[1:01:52] the wonders of God and we talk about the
[1:01:53] mercies of God and we talk about the
[1:01:55] healing and the miracles and how great
[1:01:57] the word is. But as soon as someone sins
[1:02:00] against us, as soon as soon as someone
[1:02:02] offends us, our testimony, we throw it
[1:02:04] right in the garbage can.
[1:02:07] It just leaves right there. Now you can
[1:02:11] tell a real Christian all of us fail.
[1:02:15] But that real Christian will be
[1:02:17] condemned by their actions. Not about
[1:02:20] somebody else but about yourself. Amen.
[1:02:24] And then that person will repent no
[1:02:28] matter if somebody did them did them
[1:02:29] wrong or not. When I counsel people who
[1:02:32] are in a dispute,
[1:02:34] which is usually the counseling that
[1:02:36] that's probably the the majority of the
[1:02:38] counseling, I almost take the ang I
[1:02:41] almost always take the angle of Christ
[1:02:44] did not teach us how others should treat
[1:02:48] us. He taught us how we should treat
[1:02:50] others no matter how someone else treats
[1:02:53] us. So, how are you treating that person
[1:02:56] is what I'll ask. How do how are you
[1:02:59] treating that person? and they say,
[1:03:00] "Well, he did this or she did this." No.
[1:03:02] No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. That
[1:03:04] doesn't matter. Are you a Christian?
[1:03:06] Yes. Then it doesn't matter what they
[1:03:07] did to you. Did they do worse to you
[1:03:10] than they did to Jesus? Pulling out his
[1:03:13] beard and spitting in his face, ripping
[1:03:16] his clothes off,
[1:03:19] bartering for his garment, putting him
[1:03:22] naked up on the cross. Have they done
[1:03:23] that to you? No.
[1:03:26] How are you treating this person? Not
[1:03:29] how Is this person treating me?
[1:03:33] How many times have I committed is what
[1:03:36] we have to ask the same sin against God
[1:03:39] and how many times have I asked him to
[1:03:40] forgive me? And he'll forgive us. But he
[1:03:44] requires
[1:03:46] our forgiveness for others. Paul is
[1:03:48] telling us that if we want forgiveness
[1:03:50] of our sins, then we must forgive those
[1:03:52] who sin against us over and over again.
[1:03:55] We all know the story about Peter, but
[1:03:57] does anybody really believe it?
[1:04:00] When Peter asked Jesus, he said, "How
[1:04:02] many times do I have to forgive someone
[1:04:04] when they sin against me up to seven
[1:04:06] times?" And Jesus said, "No,
[1:04:09] seven times 70 times." So basically,
[1:04:13] Peter, you're not getting it, man.
[1:04:15] You're not understanding what I'm
[1:04:17] saying. It does not matter what someone
[1:04:20] does to you. It matters how you react.
[1:04:25] That is what matters. Verse number 14.
[1:04:28] And above all things, put on charity,
[1:04:30] which is the bond of perfectness. Love
[1:04:32] is the bond of perfectness. And above
[1:04:35] all, put on love, which is the bond of
[1:04:37] perfectness. That's what holds us
[1:04:38] together. And let the peace of God rule
[1:04:41] in your hearts, to the which also ye are
[1:04:43] called in one body, and be ye thankful.
[1:04:46] Let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:04:48] richly in all wisdom, teaching and
[1:04:51] admonishing one another in psalms and
[1:04:52] hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
[1:04:55] grace in your hearts to the Lord. We
[1:04:56] spent most of last Sunday on on that.
[1:04:59] And whatsoever you do in word or deed,
[1:05:01] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:05:03] giving thanks to God and the father by
[1:05:05] him. So again, if you only had one
[1:05:08] scripture in the entire Bible,
[1:05:11] it was just that one. I think you could
[1:05:13] make it. I think I think you could do
[1:05:16] it. I think you could live a Christian
[1:05:17] life. Whatever you do in word or deed,
[1:05:20] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:05:23] Did Jesus when you do something in the
[1:05:25] name of someone else, when you do
[1:05:26] something in the name of of a church or
[1:05:27] whatever, you are acting on behalf of
[1:05:29] that person or acting on behalf of that
[1:05:31] church. So, did Jesus tell you to listen
[1:05:34] to that music? Are you acting on his
[1:05:36] behalf? Did Jesus tell you to go to
[1:05:39] church this morning or to not go to
[1:05:42] church this morning? For you that are
[1:05:43] streaming, did Jesus tell you to do or
[1:05:47] to not do these things? Anything outside
[1:05:49] of the desires of Jesus should not be
[1:05:51] done. Now there's already a tone in the
[1:05:55] apostles letter here of respecting
[1:05:58] others. He says there's neither Greek
[1:05:59] nor Jew, circumcision nor
[1:06:00] uncircumcision, barbarian, scheian, bond
[1:06:03] or free, but Christ is all in all. And
[1:06:05] he says, put on therefore as the elect
[1:06:07] of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
[1:06:08] mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind,
[1:06:10] meekness, longsuffering, forebearing one
[1:06:13] another, and forgiving one another. If
[1:06:16] any man have a quarrel against any, even
[1:06:17] as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.
[1:06:20] Now, Paul is going to continue with that
[1:06:22] thought on respecting one another. And
[1:06:24] he's going to use the family as an
[1:06:26] example.
[1:06:27] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own
[1:06:31] husbands as it is fit in the Lord. The
[1:06:36] amplified version of
[1:06:38] husbands, don't be looking at your wives
[1:06:40] right now.
[1:06:44] The amplified version says, "Wives be
[1:06:46] subject to your own husbands out of
[1:06:47] respect for their position as the
[1:06:49] protector and their accountability to
[1:06:51] God as is proper proper and fitting in
[1:06:53] the Lord." There's no misogyny or sexism
[1:06:58] or prejudice associated with that
[1:07:00] statement.
[1:07:02] And while I understand that much of the
[1:07:05] Bible is written to address certain
[1:07:06] things that were going on going through
[1:07:08] at the time, Paul was addressing things
[1:07:11] that were going on in Colasse probably
[1:07:13] at that time. I also believe that God
[1:07:15] preserved his word to be applied for
[1:07:18] today. Amen. So we can't just say, well,
[1:07:20] that was in Paul's day. No, that is for
[1:07:24] today. So what is the spirit behind what
[1:07:27] Paul is saying? And how can you apply
[1:07:30] that to your life?
[1:07:32] As I said in the lesson last week,
[1:07:34] Colossians 3 and Ephesians 5 and 6 um
[1:07:37] are parallel scriptures. They say the
[1:07:40] same thing. Paul was writing to the the
[1:07:42] same thing to two different audiences.
[1:07:45] Ephesians, I'll read the New King James
[1:07:47] Version. Ephesians 5:22. Brothers, I'm
[1:07:50] I'm very sorry I didn't give you my
[1:07:52] scriptures. So if they're a little bit
[1:07:53] delayed, it's because of me. Ephesians
[1:07:56] 5:22. I'll read the New King James
[1:07:57] Version. It says, "Wives submit to your
[1:08:00] own husbands as to the Lord. For the
[1:08:02] husband is the head of the wife as
[1:08:04] Christ as also Christ is the head of the
[1:08:06] church, and he is the savior of the
[1:08:08] body. Therefore, just as the church is
[1:08:10] subject to Christ, so let the wives be
[1:08:13] subject so so let the wives be to their
[1:08:16] own husbands in everything."
[1:08:19] It's important. Now, listen to this. He
[1:08:22] is speaking to the wife. He says wives,
[1:08:26] he's not speaking to the husband.
[1:08:30] This is not a scripture that the husband
[1:08:32] can use against the wife. He's talking
[1:08:35] directly to you sisters. And he says
[1:08:38] wives. So unless you're a wife, he's not
[1:08:40] talking to you.
[1:08:42] And as a man, when I read this
[1:08:44] scripture, I see that the husband should
[1:08:46] represent Christ to his wife. Remember,
[1:08:49] the attitude is not wife, you're doing
[1:08:51] wrong. The attitude should be what can I
[1:08:53] do? So that this scripture applies to my
[1:08:55] life.
[1:08:57] He's representing Jesus. This man, this
[1:09:00] husband is representing Jesus at the
[1:09:02] head as the head. We cry out, all of us
[1:09:04] brothers, we cry out to Jesus for help
[1:09:08] and for mercy. And the husband should be
[1:09:10] there for his wife in the same manner
[1:09:13] as best that we can. As Jesus is there
[1:09:16] for us, we should be there for our
[1:09:18] wives.
[1:09:20] The wife
[1:09:22] is not
[1:09:24] dependent on your opinion. This this
[1:09:27] scripture isn't dependent on your your
[1:09:29] opinion of your husband. Doesn't have
[1:09:31] anything to do with it. If your husband
[1:09:34] is a Christian man, then he should have
[1:09:36] that position in the family as head. He
[1:09:40] will never live up to Christ.
[1:09:42] But it is up to you to give him that
[1:09:45] position according to the word here. And
[1:09:47] saying something like that's taboo
[1:09:49] today, but it's not me saying it's in
[1:09:52] the Bible.
[1:09:54] And if it's in the Bible, I believe it.
[1:09:59] And then wives,
[1:10:01] that's that was written to you. That
[1:10:03] scriptur is directly to you. Now back to
[1:10:05] Colossians 3:19. Husbands, now talking
[1:10:10] to the man. Husbands, love your wives
[1:10:13] and be not bitter against them.
[1:10:16] Again, wives, this isn't to you.
[1:10:19] Husbands, love your wives. And and
[1:10:24] again, it has nothing to do with what
[1:10:25] the wife is doing or if she or if you
[1:10:29] think that she is falling short as a
[1:10:31] wife. It's not a commandment to the
[1:10:34] wife. It's a commandment to the husband.
[1:10:36] He says, "Husband, love your wives and
[1:10:39] be not bitter against her." Let's go
[1:10:41] back to Ephesians. Ephesians 5:25.
[1:10:44] Again, they're parallel scriptures.
[1:10:46] Husbands, love your wives just as Christ
[1:10:48] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:10:50] for her, that he might sanctify and
[1:10:52] cleanse her with the washing of the
[1:10:54] water by the word, that he might present
[1:10:57] her to himself a glorious church, not
[1:11:01] having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:11:03] thing, but what she should but that she
[1:11:06] should be holy and without blemish. So
[1:11:09] husbands ought to love their wives as
[1:11:11] their own bodies. He who loves his wife
[1:11:14] loves himself.
[1:11:16] Commandments. And I'm talking to the men
[1:11:18] here. Paul is comparing your wife to the
[1:11:20] bride of Christ, Lord. And he's
[1:11:24] comparing you to Christ. Amen.
[1:11:28] So, you have big shoes. And I have big
[1:11:30] shoes to fill in this relationship as as
[1:11:33] a husband and a wife. And he's not
[1:11:34] saying that the husband takes the place
[1:11:36] of Christ. He's not saying that at all
[1:11:38] in the wife's life. She needs to have
[1:11:41] her own relationship with Christ. You
[1:11:45] can't go through your husband. That
[1:11:46] throws out all the part of the Bible
[1:11:48] where it says there's only one mediator
[1:11:50] between God and man, the man Christ
[1:11:51] Jesus. That wife has to have a
[1:11:53] relationship with with God, her own
[1:11:56] relationship.
[1:11:58] But he is saying that your relationship
[1:12:00] should have the utmost respect for each
[1:12:03] other. The husband should treat his wife
[1:12:07] with the utmost respect in a certain
[1:12:09] way. And then the wife should treat her
[1:12:11] husband with the utmost respect no
[1:12:13] matter how that man or that woman
[1:12:17] treats you.
[1:12:20] Sisters, that headship described by the
[1:12:23] Apostle Paul is also mentioned by other
[1:12:25] apostles and really throughout the
[1:12:27] Bible. So make sure that you are
[1:12:29] respecting the husband's role in your
[1:12:31] life.
[1:12:33] And again, you have your own
[1:12:35] relationship with Christ that is not
[1:12:37] dependent on your husband. But the
[1:12:40] relationship between a husband and a
[1:12:41] wife,
[1:12:43] that family, the husband's ahead.
[1:12:47] Back to Colossians 3.
[1:12:50] Children, obey your parents in all
[1:12:52] things. For this is well pleasing to the
[1:12:55] Lord. Now, let's go back over to
[1:12:57] Ephesians chapter 6. Ephesians just uh
[1:13:00] explains it a little bit more. Ephesians
[1:13:02] chapter 6 verse one says this,
[1:13:04] "Children, obey your parents in the
[1:13:06] Lord, for this is right. Honor your
[1:13:08] father and mother which is the first
[1:13:10] commandment with promise that it may be
[1:13:12] well with you and that you may live long
[1:13:14] on the earth. So there's a promise
[1:13:15] associ associated with that children if
[1:13:18] you obey your parents that you will live
[1:13:20] long and you'll be you'll do well.
[1:13:24] The love of a parent and many of us are
[1:13:27] parents here is really without bounds.
[1:13:29] We parents, we make mistakes and but we
[1:13:33] should always have the well-being and
[1:13:35] the safety of our children in our minds.
[1:13:38] A good dad tell his son or his daughter,
[1:13:42] the kind of girl, the kind of boy to
[1:13:45] date,
[1:13:46] to come to church, to fellowship with
[1:13:48] other Christian kids, to work hard, to
[1:13:52] be a be successful in the career. And a
[1:13:54] good mother teaches her children really
[1:13:56] to keep the purity and to keep their
[1:13:58] testimonies. Daily instruction on how to
[1:14:01] live a Christian life, to eat right, to
[1:14:04] be healthy, to live honestly. These
[1:14:07] things are what parents instruct their
[1:14:08] children. And then children obey your
[1:14:10] parents in all things for this is well
[1:14:12] pleasing to the Lord. So it pleases God
[1:14:15] when a child obeys his parents.
[1:14:19] And notice that it says in all things.
[1:14:24] And those are all things in Christ. Of
[1:14:28] course, they're not sinful things.
[1:14:31] I was uh my dad used to tell me,
[1:14:34] remember way back when I was a kid, I
[1:14:36] always knew how to do it better than
[1:14:38] dad.
[1:14:39] And then it would come out where it's
[1:14:42] like, wow, dad was right and I messed it
[1:14:44] up. If I'd have just done what he said,
[1:14:46] I would have fixed the car or done or
[1:14:48] fixed the wall or done whatever I was
[1:14:50] doing. And dad would dad started out he
[1:14:52] would tell me he said bud you know how
[1:14:54] long it takes to get 20 years of
[1:14:56] experience.
[1:14:59] I was like yeah he always had to say it
[1:15:02] though 20 years.
[1:15:04] And then as time went on that statement
[1:15:07] changed and he'd say bud you know how
[1:15:09] long it takes to get 30 years of
[1:15:10] experience.
[1:15:12] 30 years.
[1:15:15] He was always ahead of me.
[1:15:18] And it came to the point before my dad
[1:15:20] passed away, bud, you know how long it
[1:15:23] takes to get 50 years of experience?
[1:15:26] Yeah, Bob, I do. 50 years.
[1:15:30] Dad was always ahead.
[1:15:33] He always had more experience because
[1:15:35] that's a father.
[1:15:37] They they know they they have more
[1:15:39] experience than us. And we should
[1:15:41] respect that in our fathers and in our
[1:15:44] mothers.
[1:15:46] Colossians 3:21, "Fathers, provoke not
[1:15:49] your children to anger, lest they be
[1:15:51] discouraged." Ephesians 6:4 says, "And
[1:15:53] you fathers, do not provoke your
[1:15:55] children to wrath, but bring them up in
[1:15:57] the training and admonition of the
[1:15:59] Lord." There should be a mutual respect
[1:16:01] between the fathers and the children,
[1:16:04] the mothers and the children. And
[1:16:06] parents, don't try to beat your the word
[1:16:10] into your kids. It doesn't work. We've
[1:16:13] all seen it. You know, it's it's just
[1:16:16] insulting them and telling them they're
[1:16:18] sinners because they they rebel. Paul is
[1:16:21] saying that they will get discouraged if
[1:16:23] you treat them like that. Don't
[1:16:25] compromise on your values, but doing in
[1:16:28] a do it in a loving and respectful way.
[1:16:31] My mom wouldn't say much about my sins
[1:16:34] when I was a teenager,
[1:16:36] but she lived a life that condemned me
[1:16:41] when I would come home after after
[1:16:43] sinning or partying with my friends or
[1:16:44] doing whatever.
[1:16:46] The last person I wanted to see on earth
[1:16:47] was my mom. That's right. She wouldn't
[1:16:50] beat me. She wouldn't tell me how wrong
[1:16:51] I was. She wouldn't browbe me and and
[1:16:56] whatever it was, but she was always the
[1:16:58] pillar of holiness in my family.
[1:17:01] She lived a life above reproach. She
[1:17:04] loved me. She respected me. And she
[1:17:06] instructed me. But it was always in
[1:17:08] respect that mom talked with me. And
[1:17:10] I'll tell you what, it built a
[1:17:11] foundation for me.
[1:17:13] There's a mutual respect. It doesn't
[1:17:15] mean that a wife's walk with the Lord is
[1:17:18] dependent on her husband. Neither does
[1:17:19] it mean that a child's walk with the
[1:17:21] Lord is dependent on the parent. But it
[1:17:23] just means that we should have a a
[1:17:24] respect for each other is what the
[1:17:26] apostle is saying here. Wives for the
[1:17:28] husbands, husbands for the wives,
[1:17:30] children's for the parents, parents for
[1:17:31] the children.
[1:17:33] With the ultimate authority really, when
[1:17:36] there's a dispute, the ultimate
[1:17:39] authority lays with the husband
[1:17:41] when it's between a husband and a wife
[1:17:43] and it lays with the parent when it's
[1:17:46] between a parent and a child.
[1:17:50] And if there's friends, if there's no
[1:17:51] authority, this is always the case in
[1:17:54] every form of society. It's the case in
[1:17:56] this church. It's the case where you
[1:17:58] work. It's the case in our country. It's
[1:18:01] always the case that there has to be a
[1:18:03] an authority there because if you don't
[1:18:05] have an authority, then you just you'll
[1:18:06] have chaos and you'll have fighting. So,
[1:18:08] there has to be someone that's in
[1:18:10] charge. It's just God's way. And it
[1:18:13] really it it it's part of it. That's why
[1:18:16] this is here. But it doesn't say that
[1:18:19] there should be a dominating force
[1:18:21] there. It just says that that with
[1:18:24] mutual respect,
[1:18:26] one person will have the ultimate
[1:18:29] authority when it has to come down to
[1:18:31] that.
[1:18:33] Servants, obey in all things your
[1:18:34] masters according to the flesh, not with
[1:18:37] eye service as men pleasers, but in
[1:18:40] singleness of heart, fearing God. There
[1:18:44] was sla slavery 2,000 years ago when
[1:18:46] Paul wrote this. And although the Bible
[1:18:48] teaches against slavery, still here
[1:18:51] today,
[1:18:52] we can apply this to our lives. We
[1:18:55] respect those that have authority over
[1:18:57] us. Our boss,
[1:19:00] governor, politicians, president, always
[1:19:03] respect those that have rule over you
[1:19:06] because it says right here, because it
[1:19:07] pleases God.
[1:19:10] The next scripture is another one of
[1:19:12] those that you can live your life by
[1:19:15] like verse 17. Verse 23 says this, "And
[1:19:18] whatsoever you do, do it heartily as to
[1:19:21] the Lord and not unto men." New Living
[1:19:24] Translation says, "Work willingly at
[1:19:26] whatever you do as though you were
[1:19:28] working for the Lord rather than for
[1:19:30] people."
[1:19:31] NIV says, "Whatever you do, work at it
[1:19:34] with all your heart as working for the
[1:19:36] Lord and not as human masters." So that
[1:19:39] is a direct instruction for you at work,
[1:19:42] your church, and every other service you
[1:19:45] give. Whether you get paid or whether
[1:19:47] whe whether you do it for free, whether
[1:19:49] you're delivering door dash or whether
[1:19:51] you're serving the Lord, you or whether
[1:19:54] you're you're serving people here in
[1:19:56] church, you do all things to the Lord.
[1:20:01] That includes work, that includes
[1:20:03] driving, that includes whatever you're
[1:20:05] doing, you do it as you're serving God.
[1:20:08] and not so much as that as as serving
[1:20:10] that person
[1:20:12] knowing that and and it'll make you
[1:20:15] successful.
[1:20:16] Just imagine if there was somebody
[1:20:19] working in your office or your place of
[1:20:22] of of work, your imagine if there was a
[1:20:26] person that counted his job or her job
[1:20:31] that if I do a good job, I'm pleasing
[1:20:33] God. If I do a bla bad job, I'm not
[1:20:35] pleasing God. The better I do, the more
[1:20:39] I'm pleasing God. Imagine if there was
[1:20:41] somebody that worked with you like that.
[1:20:44] That's how we should be. And you know
[1:20:46] what? You'll be successful in doing it,
[1:20:51] knowing that of the Lord you shall
[1:20:53] receive the reward of the inheritance,
[1:20:55] for ye shall serve
[1:20:58] the Lord Christ.
[1:21:02] It's a practical application.
[1:21:05] Remember, I've said many times that this
[1:21:08] Bible, if you really do what it says,
[1:21:10] you're going to prosper. You're going to
[1:21:11] do well in life. People are going to
[1:21:13] like you. You're going to be one of the
[1:21:15] the everybody wants on their team
[1:21:18] because you're serving God, you're doing
[1:21:19] your best. NIV of that verse says,
[1:21:23] "Since you know that you will receive an
[1:21:24] inheritance from the Lord as a reward,
[1:21:27] it is Christ you are serving.
[1:21:31] But he that doeth wrong shall receive
[1:21:32] for the wrong which he hath done and
[1:21:35] there is no respect of persons.
[1:21:38] And I view of that says anyone who does
[1:21:39] wrong will be repaid for their wrongs
[1:21:42] and there is no favoritism.
[1:21:45] So do you think because you're a
[1:21:47] Christian that you can slack on your
[1:21:50] job?
[1:21:53] The scriptures I just read say the exact
[1:21:56] opposite. Do you think that because
[1:21:58] you're a pastor, because you're a deacon
[1:21:59] or a trustee or a member of this church
[1:22:02] that God is not going to hold you
[1:22:03] accountable for your actions and your
[1:22:06] work ethic? No, you're more responsible
[1:22:10] and you're held to a higher level. You
[1:22:13] see the mutual respect that Paul, you
[1:22:15] have to look at the spirit that this is
[1:22:17] written in. So Paul is he starts with
[1:22:19] the with with just
[1:22:23] the the people that you're around and he
[1:22:24] goes to the families and and he's
[1:22:26] basically saying listen do your best and
[1:22:30] love one another and respect one
[1:22:33] another. That's the meaning for the
[1:22:35] whole thing. And and don't try to break
[1:22:38] it down and don't try to just just set a
[1:22:40] a well I have to do this if this and
[1:22:42] this. No, no, no. There's a spirit
[1:22:44] there, a spirit of respecting each
[1:22:47] other.
[1:22:48] And it's all throughout the Bible. Jesus
[1:22:50] did it. I mean, Paul, when he was
[1:22:55] when he was slapped in the face,
[1:22:59] when he was put in prison and he was
[1:23:01] being tried and he was slapped in face,
[1:23:03] I don't know if it was by the high
[1:23:04] priest or the high priest's servant.
[1:23:06] Paul didn't know who it was and he
[1:23:08] snapped back. You see the temper raise
[1:23:10] up in Paul. He says, "God will smite
[1:23:11] you, you whited wall." And then like,
[1:23:14] "Hey, that's the high priest." And he's
[1:23:15] like, "Oh, sorry." He respected even
[1:23:18] that position
[1:23:20] of the man. There was respect in Paul.
[1:23:23] Let's close. Let's continue on with uh
[1:23:26] chapter 4 um verse one. It says,
[1:23:29] "Masters, give unto your servants that
[1:23:31] which is just and equal, knowing that ye
[1:23:34] also have a master in heaven." In
[1:23:35] today's world, he's te he's telling the
[1:23:37] employers that you need to treat your
[1:23:39] employees right because you've got a
[1:23:42] boss too. And ultimately the big boss is
[1:23:45] God
[1:23:47] and he's watching.
[1:23:49] Again, show respect to everyone. And if
[1:23:51] you want God show to show you respect to
[1:23:54] respect your prayers, respect others.
[1:23:57] Verse number two, continue in prayer and
[1:24:00] watch in the same with thanksgiving.
[1:24:03] This is another one that we can live our
[1:24:05] lives by.
[1:24:08] It's devote yourselves to prayer and be
[1:24:12] watchful and thankful. How can we have
[1:24:14] understanding of the spirit,
[1:24:17] understanding of the scriptures if we're
[1:24:20] not praying about them? We're not asking
[1:24:22] God. If we don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:24:23] leading us, how can we have patience
[1:24:25] with our wives or patience with our
[1:24:27] husbands without prayer? How can you do
[1:24:31] it? How can you have wisdom to lead a
[1:24:34] family without prayer?
[1:24:36] How can we take a subservient role in a
[1:24:40] relationship
[1:24:42] without prayer?
[1:24:44] Whether that relationship is a respect
[1:24:46] for a parent, a husband or a boss. How
[1:24:48] can we do it without prayer? Without
[1:24:51] drawing that strength from God. How can
[1:24:54] we have patience and not lose our
[1:24:56] tempers without prayer? Amen. How can we
[1:25:01] do it? Sincere, fervent prayer. How can
[1:25:05] we truly know God without prayer?
[1:25:10] How can you know me if you don't talk to
[1:25:12] me? You hear me up here preaching,
[1:25:16] but you to get to know me, you have to
[1:25:20] have a conversation with me. You have to
[1:25:24] talk after service and see my
[1:25:26] personality and see the way I am. And
[1:25:28] that's how it is with God. How can we
[1:25:29] truly know God if we're not on our knees
[1:25:32] talking with him and communicating with
[1:25:34] him and not just talking ourselves? Let
[1:25:38] him talk back.
[1:25:40] If you come up to me and you're just a
[1:25:42] never- ending sentence
[1:25:45] and you leave, you don't know who I am.
[1:25:48] You didn't learn anything about me. All
[1:25:50] you did was talk the whole time.
[1:25:53] But let me talk. Amen. And then you will
[1:25:57] understand who this man is. And the same
[1:26:00] with God. Be still
[1:26:04] as as the psalm says, "And know that I'm
[1:26:06] God." Listen to him. Listen for his
[1:26:09] answer to these questions. Listen to his
[1:26:12] answer to the scriptures. Lord, what are
[1:26:14] you trying to say in this scripture?
[1:26:17] Lord, I place it into your hands. Help
[1:26:19] me. And then you think about that
[1:26:22] scripture and meditate on that scripture
[1:26:23] and he'll give you the answer.
[1:26:26] Paul understood, the musicians can come
[1:26:29] when we'll close. Paul understood that
[1:26:31] the only way people can truly follow the
[1:26:34] teachings of Christ is through a
[1:26:35] personal relationship with God, as I say
[1:26:38] often. And this cannot be accomplished
[1:26:40] without prayer.
[1:26:43] He taught mutual respect with our our
[1:26:46] our families and and each other. And
[1:26:50] I'll read verse three again. with all
[1:26:51] praying also for us. He says that God
[1:26:55] would open to unto us the door of
[1:26:56] utterance to speak the mystery of Christ
[1:26:58] for which I am also in bond. So we know
[1:27:01] that Paul is writing this letter from
[1:27:03] prison
[1:27:05] that I might make it manifest as I ought
[1:27:07] to speak. Walk in wisdom toward them
[1:27:10] that are without redeeming the time.
[1:27:13] That word without
[1:27:15] means it says the a more modern
[1:27:18] translation says be wise in the way you
[1:27:20] act towards outsiders
[1:27:23] making the most of every opportunity.
[1:27:25] Really that old man on the plane
[1:27:29] he says making the most of opportunity.
[1:27:31] My biggest
[1:27:33] um
[1:27:35] um regret was I didn't talk to him more
[1:27:40] and and I and I didn't get his phone
[1:27:42] number maybe and reach out to him later.
[1:27:44] Make the most of every opportunity,
[1:27:49] everything that we do, whoever we talk
[1:27:51] to, make the most of that. Make the most
[1:27:54] of my opportunity here in in my my hour
[1:27:57] of ministering. and I want to make the
[1:27:59] most of it and say respect one another
[1:28:01] friends don't let those things go that's
[1:28:04] what the apostle is trying to trying to
[1:28:06] say here with talking with the
[1:28:08] scientists with all the philosophical
[1:28:10] discussions did I present Christ in love
[1:28:13] to him and accurately according to the
[1:28:16] scriptures did I make the most of that
[1:28:18] opportunity
[1:28:20] and let your speech always be always
[1:28:21] with grace
[1:28:23] seasoned with salt that you may know how
[1:28:26] you ought to answer every man. I looked
[1:28:31] up that word grace.
[1:28:33] Let your speech be always seasoned with
[1:28:36] grace.
[1:28:37] The definition of grace is courteous
[1:28:40] goodwill.
[1:28:43] And another definition was unmmerited
[1:28:45] divine assistance given to humans for
[1:28:48] their regeneration or sanctification. A
[1:28:51] virtue coming from God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:53] And let your speech always be with that
[1:28:55] grace.
[1:28:57] seasoned with salt. They want more of it
[1:29:02] that you may know how you ought to
[1:29:04] answer every man. So Paul is closing his
[1:29:07] letter with a statement. Let your speech
[1:29:11] be always with grace, always courteous.
[1:29:14] No matter if you are angry with someone
[1:29:16] or if someone wronged with you, always
[1:29:19] be courteous. Always treat each other
[1:29:22] with respect. I just went through all
[1:29:24] the relationships that that every one of
[1:29:26] us have. I think I probably covered
[1:29:28] every single one. It's always with
[1:29:31] respect for each other, courteous
[1:29:33] towards towards each other, and always
[1:29:36] speaking to others with unmmerited
[1:29:39] divine assistance given to humans for
[1:29:41] their regeneration or sanctification
[1:29:44] that you might represent this grace of
[1:29:45] Jesus Christ to others. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:50] We'll finish the book of Colossians
[1:29:51] tonight.
[1:29:53] Um,
[1:29:54] and uh, I'm really
[1:29:57] I hope that you've been blessed by going
[1:30:00] through this this book. It just it hits
[1:30:03] every so many aspects of our lives from
[1:30:08] living like the world to living overly
[1:30:10] legalistic and now all the way to just
[1:30:13] treat each other with love and respect.
[1:30:15] Husbands and wives, just love each
[1:30:18] other. You know, wives, let put your
[1:30:21] husband up as the head of the family,
[1:30:22] but still have your own relationship.
[1:30:24] Husbands, treat your wife like Christ
[1:30:26] treats the bride of Christ. Thank you,
[1:30:28] Lord. Always be there for her. Children,
[1:30:32] respect your parents.
[1:30:35] Obey them. And it's not the promise is
[1:30:37] that you're going to live your life long
[1:30:40] on earth. And it isn't because your
[1:30:42] parents are just going to kill you.
[1:30:46] It's because they're going to teach you
[1:30:47] right. Amen. All right. If you do what
[1:30:50] they say, you'll prosper if you do what
[1:30:54] your parents say. Because guess what?
[1:30:56] They're the ones that love you the most
[1:30:59] in the whole world. His mom and dad,
[1:31:01] Jerry, your dad loves you more than
[1:31:02] anybody else in the world. You know, he
[1:31:05] does. And he wants what's best for you.
[1:31:08] He can be wrong. I could be wrong in
[1:31:11] dealing with my son. I might give him
[1:31:13] wrong advice every once in a while, but
[1:31:15] it's not because there's malice in my
[1:31:17] heart. It's because I love him.
[1:31:20] Put God first and then honor one
[1:31:23] another. Amen. We have baptisms this
[1:31:25] morning. How many baptisms? How many
[1:31:28] people would like to be baptized? One.
[1:31:31] Anyone else?
[1:31:34] At least one. Two. Yeah, we got plenty.
[1:31:36] Good. If you can make your way back to
[1:31:39] the back,
[1:31:41] friends, baptism
[1:31:44] is it's a statement to everyone here.
[1:31:48] The people that go up and are baptized
[1:31:50] in front of all of us, they're saying,
[1:31:52] "Listen, I'm a Christian.
[1:31:55] This man Jesus, the way that he gave his
[1:31:57] life for everyone else, the way that he
[1:32:00] put other people in front of himself
[1:32:03] when he prefers someone else, he would
[1:32:06] rather Jesus said, "I would rather this
[1:32:09] guy be rich than me."
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:14] Does that thought ever even cross the
[1:32:16] mind of people? I would rather my
[1:32:20] colleague prosper
[1:32:23] in work than me. Wow.
[1:32:28] Can that happen? Straight is the gate
[1:32:31] and narrow is the way and few that will
[1:32:32] be able to find it is what Jesus said in
[1:32:34] that same context. So we have to live
[1:32:37] that life. Amen.
[1:32:41] Brother Josiah, there you are.
[1:32:45] Let's
[1:32:47] sing that old chorus, Brother Jordan. I

[1:34:08] nothing here to hinder me. That's right.
[1:34:13] You're getting it. Oh, I don't want
[1:34:18] nothing here to hinder me.
[1:34:25] For someday
[1:34:27] his blessed face I want to see.
[1:34:35] It makes no difference
[1:34:38] what the cost
[1:34:40] or how heavy
[1:34:43] my cross.
[1:34:45] I don't want
[1:34:47] nothing here to hinder me. Just one more
[1:34:52] time together.
[1:34:55] I don't want
[1:34:57] nothing here to hinder me
[1:35:04] for someday.
[1:35:06] His blessing face I want to see.
[1:35:14] Oh, it makes no difference
[1:35:17] what the cost
[1:35:19] or how heavy
[1:35:22] my cross.
[1:35:24] I don't want
[1:35:26] nothing here to hinder me.
[1:35:33] Hear that? Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:35:39] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:35:48] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:35:58] He gave himself.
[1:36:03] What more could he give?
[1:36:08] Oh, how he loves you.
[1:36:13] Oh, how he loves me.
[1:36:18] Oh, how he loves you and me. Let's sing
[1:36:24] that real sweetly now. Yes. Oh, how he
[1:36:30] loves you and me.
[1:36:37] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:36:46] He gave himself.
[1:36:51] What more could he give?

[1:37:27] he loves you.
[1:37:30] Oh, how
[1:37:32] he loves me.
[1:37:35] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:37:44] I want to live
[1:37:48] the way
[1:37:50] he wants me
[1:37:53] to live.
[1:37:55] I want to live
[1:37:58] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:38:06] want to love
[1:38:09] love till there's just no more love. For
[1:38:16] I could never
[1:38:18] never out love the Lord.
[1:38:23] Come on, let me hear you sing it. I want
[1:38:26] to live
[1:38:28] the way
[1:38:30] he wants me to live. I want to give
[1:38:38] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:38:45] want to love.
[1:38:48] Love till there's just no more love. for
[1:38:55] I could never
[1:38:57] ever out love the Lord.
[1:39:03] Baptism,
[1:39:04] as we know, is one of the foundational
[1:39:06] beliefs of a Christian.
[1:39:09] Baptism
[1:39:11] is
[1:39:12] symbolizing
[1:39:14] you going into the water,
[1:39:18] a sinner, and coming out washed clean
[1:39:22] from your sins. and not only going into
[1:39:24] the water as a sinner, but coming out as
[1:39:27] a new person in Christ. The Bible says a
[1:39:30] new man, a new woman in Christ.
[1:39:35] That is what we're doing today. The the
[1:39:38] the book of Acts when they saw the Holy
[1:39:41] Spirit fall, they wanted that se same
[1:39:44] thing that the apostles had. They wanted
[1:39:46] that same spirit. They wanted to live
[1:39:48] the same life. And when they asked the
[1:39:51] Apostle Peter, they said, "What do what
[1:39:54] do we do?" Peter said, "Repent every one
[1:39:58] of you and be baptized in the name of
[1:40:00] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:40:02] sins, and then you shall receive that
[1:40:05] gift of the Holy Spirit, that same gift
[1:40:07] that fell upon the apostles." Sister, if
[1:40:10] you say your name, Angelina. Sister
[1:40:12] Angelina, as as a friend, you've been
[1:40:15] coming here for a while now. The family
[1:40:17] is just a blessing to all of us and and
[1:40:20] seeing the the dedication that they
[1:40:23] have. This this new family with these
[1:40:26] new children and wanting to serve the
[1:40:28] Lord. Sister Angelina comes in here.
[1:40:30] Sister, you know what this represents
[1:40:34] and this is by your own desire. This is
[1:40:36] something that you want. That's the most
[1:40:39] important thing that there's something
[1:40:40] inside of you. God bless you.
[1:40:57] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:01] Sister Angelina, by your own confession,
[1:41:04] I baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:41:06] Jesus Christ
[1:41:08] for the remission of your sins.
[1:41:17] Praise God. It's a good day.
[1:41:22] We have more. Praise the Lord. It's this
[1:41:25] is there's a lot of hard things about
[1:41:28] being a pastor, but this is not one of
[1:41:29] them. This is just one of the the
[1:41:32] greatest things that that you can do as
[1:41:34] a minister and being a part of a soul
[1:41:37] giving his or her life to the Lord
[1:41:38] Jesus.
[1:42:12] been watching this young man and it's a
[1:42:15] blessing to see the Lord working in his
[1:42:17] heart. What's your name? Joseph Boswell.
[1:42:21] Brother Joseph is
[1:42:23] um the Lord's working on it and he's
[1:42:26] doing this and brother Joseph this is
[1:42:29] your own decision and you are doing this
[1:42:32] because you are making a change. You are
[1:42:34] giving your heart to Jesus Christ. It's
[1:42:36] the best decision you could ever make in
[1:42:38] your life.
[1:42:44] my hand.
[1:42:50] Joseph are your own confession. I
[1:42:52] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:42:54] Jesus Christ
[1:42:58] for the remission of your sins.
[1:43:09] That's it. Praise God.
[1:43:13] I love doing this. You know, God's
[1:43:15] blessing our church more and more people
[1:43:18] coming to baptism. More and more how how
[1:43:21] the Lord is dealing with in miracles,
[1:43:24] bringing them back. Listen, claim. If
[1:43:26] there's something on your heart, claim
[1:43:28] it in the name of Jesus Christ. Put it
[1:43:31] into his hands. And he promised that if
[1:43:33] we agree, just two of us, but if this
[1:43:36] whole congregation will agree, then he
[1:43:38] will do it. So, do you have something on
[1:43:41] your heart, friends? Let's all stand.
[1:43:48] When we close in prayer,
[1:43:50] if you have something on your heart,
[1:43:53] make sure to put it before the Lord and
[1:43:55] trust in God that he will deliver that
[1:44:00] which you have placed before him. Amen.
[1:44:04] Brother Jordan, could you come up and
[1:44:07] close in prayer? Brother Jordan
[1:44:08] Peterson,
[1:44:11] God bless you, brothers and sisters. I
[1:44:13] appreciate your kindness. I appreciate
[1:44:15] the service this morning. Do you love
[1:44:16] the word of God? You love the book of
[1:44:19] Colossians.
[1:44:22] We will finish up this evening and if
[1:44:24] the Lord's willing, I want to read the
[1:44:27] entire book. So, we'll there's just some
[1:44:29] uh some greetings at the end that we
[1:44:31] haven't read yet. And then I just want
[1:44:34] to read the entire book
[1:44:37] just just like we are the the Colossian
[1:44:39] church and just sit back and just listen
[1:44:44] to this would have been the same as it
[1:44:46] was 2,000 years ago when the Apostle
[1:44:48] Paul wrote these words. I want to do
[1:44:51] that tonight if the Lord's willing. So
[1:44:53] God bless you. Hope to see you this
[1:44:54] evening. Brother Josiah, turn it back to
[1:44:57] you. Thanks.
[1:45:01] [Music]
[1:45:05] this morning.
[1:45:07] Lord, we humbly come to you. Uh people
[1:45:10] that need you, Lord. And as brother
[1:45:12] Josiah just taught us that song, we
[1:45:15] don't want nothing to hinder us, Lord.
[1:45:17] So just help us, Lord. We see these ones
[1:45:20] come to be baptized this morning. Just
[1:45:22] bless them, Lord, now as they go. and
[1:45:24] just help them to
[1:45:27] to fight the fight of good faith, Lord,
[1:45:30] to be the Christians, Lord, as they go,
[1:45:32] Lord. Strengthen them, Lord. Grant them
[1:45:36] full filling of your spirit, Lord. And
[1:45:38] each one of us, Lord, if we're lacking
[1:45:40] that oil in our lamps, Lord, would you
[1:45:42] just fill us, Lord, and let us be ready
[1:45:44] for your soon coming, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[1:45:47] we see the times changing, Lord, and the
[1:45:49] things happening, Lord, and so we just
[1:45:51] ask that you would help us, Lord. And if
[1:45:53] you would terry, Lord, may we just
[1:45:55] continue as Christians. Lord,
[1:45:58] increasing in character and Lord,
[1:46:01] seeking, Lord, a closer walk with you.
[1:46:03] Lord, bless each one that came this
[1:46:06] morning. Continue to be with our day,
[1:46:08] Lord. Help us to make it a day of just
[1:46:11] thinking on you and worshiping you and
[1:46:13] praising you for all the things you've
[1:46:14] done for us, Lord. And we'll be sure to
[1:46:16] give you all the glory and the honor
[1:46:18] that's due you. We pray these things in
[1:46:20] your name, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:46:26] Thank God I am free. If we could get the
[1:46:29] the words to that song up there, Brother
[1:46:30] Tim.
