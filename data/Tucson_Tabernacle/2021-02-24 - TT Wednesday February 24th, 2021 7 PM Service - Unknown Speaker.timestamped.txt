[45:24] and we pray that you'll heal the sick
[45:26] get Glory out of the service for we ask
[45:28] it in Jesus name
[45:33] amen and Luke the 7th chapter and the
[45:36] 36th verse I'll just read one verse and
[45:40] when you go home tonight perhaps you
[45:43] read the rest of this chapter it's very
[45:46] outstanding and I'll just read this just
[45:48] to start with the 36th verse and one of
[45:53] the
[45:54] Pharisees uh I like this to begin with
[45:58] um desired him that he would sit with
[46:02] him at at me and he went into the
[46:07] Pharisees house and sat down to meet I
[46:11] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[46:13] reading of that word um of a story that
[46:17] happened long years
[46:20] ago now
[46:23] the uh I love the Lord Jesus with with
[46:27] all my heart and I know you do too so
[46:29] now while we're talking let's just open
[46:31] up our hearts let the Holy Spirit come
[46:33] in and speak to us now there's something
[46:37] wrong here in the beginning with our
[46:40] text tonight there's just something it's
[46:42] not right what did this Pharisee want
[46:46] with Jesus you know usually man ask you
[46:48] to come eat with them when they love you
[46:51] and they want to sit down and have some
[46:53] fellowship with you and um usually
[46:56] that's the way Brother Joseph and I has
[46:58] a lot of Fellowship we get out here to
[47:00] one of these places and get us a
[47:02] hamburger and some french fries and we
[47:05] have a lot of Fellowship over those
[47:07] hamburgers we love each other and but
[47:11] what could this fairy want with Jesus he
[47:15] hated Jesus and why was he asking uh
[47:20] Jesus to come eat with him one the
[47:22] Pharisees didn't like Jesus they didn't
[47:25] they didn't believe in him and they
[47:27] hated him and why would the Pharisee ask
[47:30] Jesus to come eat with him there's just
[47:33] something wrong somewhere they just
[47:35] don't cooperate together when the
[47:38] Pharisees hated them so bad and here one
[47:40] of the chief Pharisees is asking to come
[47:43] eat dinner with him come to one of these
[47:45] a great banquet he's going to have and
[47:47] eat with him there too much difference
[47:49] there that's the way it is just no uh
[47:53] people usually that hang around together
[47:55] while they have fellowship with each
[47:57] other when they got things in common now
[48:00] if you got things in common like a uh a
[48:03] little children they they play with each
[48:06] other they have things in common the
[48:08] Bible speaks of that Isaiah said the
[48:11] little children playing in the street
[48:13] now when you see little children they
[48:15] all maybe one can speak German the other
[48:18] can speak Swedish the other English but
[48:20] they got a lot of things in common
[48:22] because they're children they spend
[48:24] their tops and play with their dolls and
[48:26] things they've got things in common when
[48:29] you see a little like a little girl
[48:31] hanging around with
[48:32] Grandma there something wrong there now
[48:36] when you see a little girl hanging
[48:38] around with Grandma there's too much
[48:40] difference in their age now there's
[48:42] something wrong either she's Grandma's
[48:45] pet or she maybe grandma might have a
[48:48] sack of candy in her pocket you see so
[48:51] might be some reason there that some
[48:53] motive as that little girl is hanging
[48:55] around with Grandma because there's too
[48:57] much difference in their age now young
[48:59] people have things and they associate
[49:01] together and have things in common and
[49:04] the middle age have things in common and
[49:07] and the old people have things in common
[49:11] and like clubs the Kanas they have
[49:14] things in common they like to get
[49:17] together and eat together the Kanas Club
[49:19] because they talk about the Affairs of
[49:21] the city and how taking care of the poor
[49:24] and so forth they have things in common
[49:27] as my mother used to say the old proverb
[49:29] birds of a feather flock together
[49:32] there's a whole lot to that did you know
[49:33] that that's why you all are here tonight
[49:36] that's why we' together tonight we got
[49:38] things in common that's why you're not
[49:40] out to Road houses and picture shows
[49:43] tonight you you come here to the Church
[49:45] of God tonight we got things in common
[49:48] we like to talk over things and have
[49:50] Fellowship one with another we all
[49:52] believe in the same thing we got the
[49:55] same purpose that's why all these
[49:57] ministers are sitting around here and so
[49:59] forth we got and that's why that spirit
[50:01] is moving Among Us like it is we have
[50:04] things in common Jesus you know when the
[50:07] Holy Ghost fell they were in one place
[50:09] and one Accord everything in common they
[50:12] were waiting for the Holy Ghost to come
[50:15] they had things in common everyone was
[50:17] waiting for the promise of the father
[50:20] and that's why we are here tonight we
[50:22] are have things in common because Jesus
[50:25] said wherever two three are gathered
[50:27] together in my name I'll be in their
[50:29] midst and whatever they ask I'll give it
[50:32] to them so now we have things in common
[50:35] we believe in the Full Gospel we believe
[50:37] in the Holy Spirit we believe in the
[50:39] second coming of Jesus we believe in
[50:41] Divine Healing that's why we've all
[50:43] gathered around the have we got things
[50:46] in common birds of a feather we flock
[50:49] together I'm so glad to have your kind
[50:52] of feathers and so we can have this
[50:55] Fellowship now that is true the old
[50:58] proverb birds of a feather you ever
[51:01] notice you take for instance crows and
[51:04] doves they don't have any fellowship
[51:05] with each other because why their diet
[51:08] is different they couldn't invite one
[51:11] another to dinner because the crow is a
[51:13] scavenger he just eats on an old dead
[51:16] carcass somewhere and the dove doesn't
[51:19] have any Gall so if it eat that stuff it
[51:21] would kill
[51:22] it of The Sinner and the Christian I
[51:25] mean when he's a a Christian see now the
[51:28] dove will sit down in the wheat field
[51:30] and eat all day long with her kind and
[51:32] coup and the old crow will sit over
[51:34] there on a no dead carcass and call and
[51:36] eat all day long see they don't have no
[51:38] fellowship at all but now the strange
[51:41] thing is if the dove would go eat on the
[51:44] on the dead carcass it would kill the
[51:46] dove but the crow can eat there and also
[51:48] eat the wheat also that makes him a
[51:50] Hypocrites see so you have to watch
[51:53] that we have to watch that see the the
[51:57] dove the real true Christian cannot go
[52:00] over and indulge in the world but the
[52:03] hypocrite can be a low down hypocrite
[52:06] and be a sinner now and go out and act
[52:09] like a Christian that's bad that's real
[52:12] bad but the real Christian can't come
[52:14] over here and partake in this he hasn't
[52:16] got any go he can't digest the things
[52:20] amen I hope you know what I mean and I'm
[52:22] not trying to hurt your feelings Center
[52:24] but that's right that's just what it is
[52:27] he couldn't go in a barroom and drink
[52:28] and go out and Gamble and things like
[52:31] that he he just hasn't got the gall to
[52:33] digest it that's all something else has
[52:35] t place he's been changed he's had an
[52:38] operation amen God laid him out on the
[52:42] operating table and took the gall out of
[52:44] him when he give him the Holy Ghost and
[52:47] he just can't take those things no more
[52:49] that's right so he can't have
[52:51] Fellowship but something's wrong with
[52:54] the picture when this Pharisee now
[52:57] to my opinion the crow but he's he's
[53:00] trying to bring Jesus down there to have
[53:04] like you wanted fellowship with him but
[53:07] there's something wrong it just won't
[53:09] work the first thing you know what
[53:11] Pharisee means the word Pharisee means
[53:16] actor the Greek word for Pharisee means
[53:19] the actor somebody who acts put on you
[53:23] know America's so full of that anyhow
[53:25] Act

[53:32] there you take the people the screen

[56:59] D I like real sing I like to be
[57:02] yourself not an actor
[57:05] Pharisee that's
[57:08] bad sun was almost going
[57:12] down I seen standing there this Courier
[57:15] had run all day
[57:17] long his feet was dirty and his face
[57:20] full of sweat his master had said to him
[57:23] now you must find
[57:26] he crossed Palestine trying to find him
[57:29] the sun was almost down thousands were
[57:32] sitting listening to One speak that
[57:36] never a man spoke like
[57:39] him people were standing on their
[57:41] tiptoes looking over they could only see
[57:44] and I can see The Courier who has come
[57:47] from this Rich Pharisees house looking
[57:49] over to see if he on his tiptoes to see
[57:51] what he could
[57:52] see after a while he quit speaking
[57:57] then he began to minister to the sick oh
[58:00] I'd love to been there wouldn't you I
[58:03] can see this Courier making his way
[58:04] through the crowd till he gets up and he
[58:07] bumps into somebody who's standing there
[58:09] wouldn't let him go any farther might
[58:11] have been philli or Nathaniel or one of
[58:14] them I don't know who it was somebody
[58:16] was standing there and he bumped into
[58:17] said I would like to speak to your
[58:20] master sir and being busy keeping the
[58:23] people away from Jesus so he could pray
[58:25] one at a time I can imagine him plac him
[58:29] back to stand aside and leave the master
[58:31] alone he's busy and um then he pushed on
[58:35] again he said but I have a message from
[58:37] my master a very prominent man in our
[58:41] country I must see your
[58:43] master and I can see them the Philip
[58:47] probably take him up to where Jesus was
[58:49] and he politely bowed before him and he
[58:53] gave him the message my master Master uh
[58:58] Pharisee Simon the Pharisee who's a
[59:01] great
[59:03] man he's great in the church and you'll
[59:06] be honored sir and he is sent for you to
[59:10] come on a certain certain date to his
[59:12] banquet and he's going to have a great
[59:16] feast and he's a rich man and he's all
[59:19] he can put on the real kind of Fe and
[59:22] you're invited to
[59:23] come could you imagine what Peter would
[59:26] say to him about like I would have said
[59:28] are you oh Jesus that Pharisee he just
[59:32] making a trump card out of you why you
[59:36] he don't need you he's got all the
[59:39] wealth of this world that he needs and
[59:42] and he don't have any need for you he's
[59:44] just going down there and make a show
[59:46] make a make you a show card that's all
[59:49] don't go look at the thousands here
[59:52] that's calling for you your time is
[59:54] needed here don't go with that down to
[59:57] that Pharisee perhaps Andrew run up said
[1:00:00] Jesus don't do that Master don't go down
[1:00:03] there but yet all the persuading that
[1:00:06] they could do Jesus politely I can see
[1:00:10] bow his head and say I will be there
[1:00:14] Jesus is never invited unless he comes
[1:00:17] just remember that if you want him into
[1:00:20] your house invite him he'll come no
[1:00:23] matter who you are how rich or how poor
[1:00:26] how bad off or how well off he'll come
[1:00:28] if you'll invite him he never turns down
[1:00:31] an invitation Jesus never did and he
[1:00:34] never will so they see he bow he and the
[1:00:40] CER sigh a little bit and oh brush back
[1:00:44] his hair out of his dirty face and back
[1:00:46] down across Palestine he'd go to take
[1:00:48] his to take his message back down how
[1:00:52] could he ever do it what was the matter
[1:00:55] with that CER that runner flunky from
[1:00:58] his master's
[1:01:00] house how could he have done it i' have
[1:01:03] said something different from that
[1:01:04] wouldn't you if IID ever got in the
[1:01:06] presence of Jesus I'd have fell at his
[1:01:09] feet first and have worshiped him but
[1:01:12] that's what's the matter with too many
[1:01:14] of us couriers today we've got to talk
[1:01:16] about our denomination talk about
[1:01:18] everything that we belong to and forget
[1:01:21] about being in the presence of Jesus we
[1:01:24] got too many things to think about other
[1:01:27] things that interest us seemingly more
[1:01:29] than Jesus how a dignity and how we can
[1:01:34] conduct ourselves and how we can make
[1:01:36] our voice sound and how we can put on
[1:01:39] this program and that program forget it
[1:01:42] what we need is get in the presence of
[1:01:43] Jesus and worship him sometimes we have
[1:01:46] a Revival and the L's agid got to put on
[1:01:50] there's and this has got to do this and
[1:01:51] this has got to do that the first thing
[1:01:53] you know there's no room for Jesus
[1:01:56] we so teared up with all of our
[1:01:58] societies and things that we forget what
[1:02:01] the Revival's
[1:02:03] about let's don't do that in Chicago
[1:02:05] this week let's invite him and and
[1:02:07] worship him when he comes when we get
[1:02:09] his presence forget about who you are
[1:02:12] what are you
[1:02:13] anyhow six foot of Earth that's right
[1:02:17] worth 84 cents if you weigh 150 lbs not
[1:02:20] very much to you anyhow so then here he
[1:02:24] was up there in the presence of jesus
[1:02:26] carried out his master's
[1:02:28] orders the man he was talking to would
[1:02:32] be his judge some
[1:02:35] day and he failed to recognize
[1:02:39] it and in these meetings where the Holy
[1:02:43] Spirit comes down and speaks to the
[1:02:45] people shows signs and wonders and heels
[1:02:48] of blind death dumb paralytics and so
[1:02:52] forth people turn away sometimes
[1:02:56] well we They Carried that church too

[1:08:04] long time ago that's way Jesus eat see
[1:08:07] they didn't sit out at the table like we
[1:08:08] do they have a big table and then and
[1:08:11] when they do they kind of scoot a couch

[1:08:38] serve and they some of those um uh
[1:08:43] people in Palestine they even was rich
[1:08:46] enough them Pharisees to have Indian
[1:08:48] waitress which a waiters is which there
[1:08:51] they're the most famous in the world and
[1:08:53] they had on shoes that little bell on
[1:08:55] the end that they could they'd play
[1:08:57] music as they walked and could they know
[1:08:59] how to put it on they put the platter in
[1:09:02] their hand like this and they would have
[1:09:04] lamb cooked with spice stuff real good
[1:09:07] and oh my they bring it out and the poor
[1:09:09] would stand on the eyes side smelling
[1:09:12] that odor and they'd serve it in such a
[1:09:14] way just make you hungry to look at it
[1:09:16] so they know how to put it on and them
[1:09:18] Pharisees know how to do it so this fell
[1:09:22] was no exception he knew how to put on a
[1:09:24] real feast so then he get everything
[1:09:27] ready and get all fixed up ready for the
[1:09:30] people to come well finally the the
[1:09:35] evening Drew near that when they was
[1:09:37] going to have the banquet and the first
[1:09:40] thing you know as soon as everything was
[1:09:42] fixed up in the out in the plaza and in
[1:09:46] the yard under the Clusters and
[1:09:48] everything was just to its place just
[1:09:50] where it ought to be just everything so
[1:09:53] SP and span a great ch drove up outside
[1:09:56] and Dr Jones I hope there's not a Dr
[1:10:00] Jones here tonight but anyhow he got out
[1:10:03] of the Chariot and my you know the the
[1:10:06] be the hospitality of Palestine as soon
[1:10:09] as he you get out of the The Chariot or
[1:10:13] wherever you come if you're invited the
[1:10:15] host when he invites you well then you
[1:10:19] come the first thing most of the travel
[1:10:21] is by foot and when Dr Jones got out
[1:10:25] course first Pharisee went and greet him
[1:10:27] hello Dr Jones I'm so happy to see you
[1:10:31] why enter into my place and up com
[1:10:33] another Chariot and the groomers taking
[1:10:36] their horses and put them in the stables
[1:10:38] and fed them and so forth and taking
[1:10:40] care of and then if someone come on foot
[1:10:43] they all those Pharisees had a lot of
[1:10:45] flunkies around their place one fellow
[1:10:48] to do one thing and one
[1:10:50] another and the first thing when you
[1:10:52] entered into the place the lowest most
[1:10:55] paid flunky of a whole bunch was a foot
[1:10:58] washer the first thing you did when you
[1:11:01] walked into a place you got your feet
[1:11:04] washed and I think of my
[1:11:07] Lord that's what proves to me he was
[1:11:10] God when he came from the highest
[1:11:13] position in heaven and become the lowest
[1:11:17] funky on the
[1:11:19] earth who do we think we are CA we own a
[1:11:22] change of clothes
[1:11:25] the god of Heaven came down and became a
[1:11:29] flunky the worst paid person in the
[1:11:33] category of the homes was a foot washer
[1:11:37] and Jesus my Lord became a foot
[1:11:43] washer and who are you now and who am
[1:11:48] I what are we so big about when we can
[1:11:51] ride in a big fine car and everything
[1:11:53] and stick our nose up and think we're
[1:11:55] somebody and the god of Heaven become a
[1:11:58] flunky foot
[1:11:59] waser shame on us what a
[1:12:04] Pity is customarily the first man that
[1:12:07] met the man when he was invited the
[1:12:09] hospitality of the orent in Palestine in
[1:12:12] those days there was um when the travel
[1:12:15] was by foot they didn't have paved
[1:12:17] streets like you got here and they had
[1:12:20] Dusty roads and um uh the palestin
[1:12:25] garment comes down as a Rob but the
[1:12:27] underneath garment buttons just uh below
[1:12:31] the
[1:12:32] knees and uh when they had robes on and
[1:12:35] sandals in those days if they could for
[1:12:37] sandals or they walk barefooted and
[1:12:40] their travel was by foot and when they
[1:12:42] would um uh along those little old
[1:12:44] trails and things where they walk um
[1:12:47] many Caravans and animals went down the
[1:12:50] trail and the droppings from their
[1:12:52] animals the birds would Peck in it and
[1:12:54] then the twisted around on the road and
[1:12:56] it would the dust it would dry and it
[1:12:59] would get Dusty and the Trav were
[1:13:01] walking like this while the dust would
[1:13:04] rooll would pick it up it get on his
[1:13:06] feet and all that um droppings from the
[1:13:09] animal and along the roads and stink and
[1:13:12] a person's feet was dirty and really
[1:13:14] needed washing before they could come
[1:13:16] into a nice home like they had there
[1:13:20] this Pharisees house so the custom was
[1:13:23] that they would bring um the foot wash
[1:13:26] uh flunky he would come out and when the
[1:13:30] man came he would take his foot and put
[1:13:33] it up under his arm like this remove his
[1:13:36] sandal wash his feet take a towel and
[1:13:38] wipe him set his sandals up on a place
[1:13:41] and reach over and get a pair of satin
[1:13:44] slippers like which that was courtesy of
[1:13:47] the host that ided him and he Tri on his
[1:13:51] feet until he got the the ones that
[1:13:53] would fit him just right and and then
[1:13:55] the next thing he would pass him on when
[1:13:57] he come back out he pull off the
[1:13:59] slippers walking all those fine rugs and
[1:14:02] things and he would be refreshed by his
[1:14:04] feet now the next thing the Palestinian
[1:14:06] Sun the direct rays of there make a real
[1:14:10] hot and blisters of face and they had
[1:14:13] oil that they would anoint and the next
[1:14:16] man when he come into a little place
[1:14:18] while they would anoint you your hands
[1:14:20] give you some or and you'd rub that put
[1:14:23] it on your neck and around your face
[1:14:25] like that and it was soothing now Oro
[1:14:28] will get old in a few days we know that
[1:14:30] but they had some sort of a little bean
[1:14:32] it comes out of Arabia like a rose when
[1:14:35] it's done and there's a little apple
[1:14:36] there and you can take that little apple
[1:14:39] and put it in your hand and rub it and
[1:14:41] it goes so deep into your pores with
[1:14:43] perfume until weeks you can still smell
[1:14:46] it on your hands and they would take
[1:14:48] that and make a perfume and put it in
[1:14:51] this anointing oril that they use to
[1:14:53] anoint their face that was part of the
[1:14:55] treasures that the uh the Queen of Sheba
[1:14:58] brought to Solomon very expensive sper
[1:15:02] so they did anoint the face and so forth
[1:15:05] now had his feet washed and dried and
[1:15:08] slippers put on and all the stink of the
[1:15:11] road was off of him and now the Rays of
[1:15:13] the sun he would rubed his face real
[1:15:16] good and Tuck a towel and wipe the oil
[1:15:17] from it now the next courtesy the host
[1:15:20] showed when he walked into the door as
[1:15:23] he went in while the host would be
[1:15:25] standing there when his visitor came and
[1:15:27] when he came up to the door he would
[1:15:29] reach over and get him by the right
[1:15:33] hand and he would kiss him on one side
[1:15:36] of the cheek then take him by the other
[1:15:38] hand and kiss him on the other side of
[1:15:40] the cheek now when he was kissed he was
[1:15:43] welcome he was a full brother then he
[1:15:46] felt welcome he could go in go the ice
[1:15:48] box get what he wanted he was at home he
[1:15:52] was kissed welcome
[1:15:55] well then all these Pharisees and things
[1:15:57] taking their place the first thing you
[1:16:00] know we look
[1:16:02] around and find setting over in the
[1:16:07] corner

[1:16:13] happen what was the matter with the
[1:16:15] funky at the
[1:16:16] door he was sitting there with unwashed
[1:16:20] feet unano head not kissed he wasn't

[1:16:35] didn't have time he let Jesus slip by
[1:16:37] and get
[1:16:38] in and the flunky let him slip by oh I
[1:16:43] wish I could tuck that flunky's place an
[1:16:47] opportunity to wash Jesus
[1:16:51] feet and to anointed him and made him
[1:16:56] welcome that's the way it is he invited
[1:17:00] him and then didn't make him
[1:17:02] welcome that's what we do we invite him
[1:17:06] and then won't make him
[1:17:08] welcome when the president would come to
[1:17:11] this city or any City you'd hang out the
[1:17:14] streets full of flags you'd stroll the
[1:17:17] streets of flowers you'd send the band

[1:17:25] him
[1:17:26] welcome but Jesus can come to your
[1:17:29] city into your home and you'll give him

[1:25:50] any attention to him and but dirty feet
[1:25:54] sming back the people passing
[1:25:58] by look on the outside there where all
[1:26:00] the Easter are Gap anyhow they was
[1:26:02] looking over to see Pharisee and
[1:26:04] smelling of their food and things the
[1:26:06] line draw they couldn't come no farther
[1:26:08] and Pharisee over there just a rejoicing
[1:26:10] with his friends and so forth and Jesus
[1:26:12] sitting there with dirty feet think of
[1:26:15] it I see walking along the side of the
[1:26:18] crowd on the outside a little woman with
[1:26:22] a veil over her face
[1:26:24] I hear somebody punch another and say
[1:26:26] look who's come up the Bible said that
[1:26:30] she was a awful
[1:26:32] sinner we won't have to go in detail
[1:26:35] about that she was a prostitute a foul
[1:26:39] woman listen sometimes you push them
[1:26:42] people back but
[1:26:45] remember somebody introduced her to that
[1:26:47] life before there can be a foul woman
[1:26:50] there has to be a foul man that's right
[1:26:54] maybe some boy uh fell in love with her
[1:26:57] and enticed her and made her promises
[1:27:00] and ruined her life and introduced her
[1:27:02] or such and then pushed her off to one
[1:27:04] side and run off to get some other woman
[1:27:07] that might have started her she's some
[1:27:09] mother's daughter I think oh we're so
[1:27:12] righteous though you know oh my we can't
[1:27:15] go down and talk to people like that if

[1:27:19] and they have the best societies while
[1:27:21] we don't want to bring them into church
[1:27:22] brother Jesus said go the hes and byways
[1:27:25] and bring them in no matter who they
[1:27:29] are sometimes they're the ones who

[1:35:06] the party what was the party taking
[1:35:09] place now what we care what the party
[1:35:12] was doing how many rules she broke she
[1:35:14] was getting before Jesus and getting
[1:35:16] saved and that's what we need to do
[1:35:18] tonight is to get before Jesus and get
[1:35:20] saved no matter what you're breaking the
[1:35:22] rules of the regul that has nothing to
[1:35:24] do with it the thing of it is is get
[1:35:27] before Jesus and she was washing his
[1:35:29] feet with her tears and she was W first
[1:35:32] thing you know she was so excited she
[1:35:34] started to raise up and all of her hairs
[1:35:37] that she had pinned up on her head fell
[1:35:40] down and she be to wipe his feet with
[1:35:43] her with the hairs of her
[1:35:46] head it'll be a hard time for a lot of
[1:35:48] our Christian sisters to do that have to
[1:35:50] stand on their head to do it they got a
[1:35:51] hair a wifey seat with her that's right
[1:35:54] I don't say that for a joke but let me
[1:35:56] tell you something the Bible said a
[1:35:58] woman's hair is her glory yes sir look
[1:36:01] what a beautiful place that fit there
[1:36:03] her tears of repentance she was washing
[1:36:06] his feet and the only decent thing she
[1:36:09] had about her was her hair and her glory
[1:36:12] fell down
[1:36:15] Hallelujah her glory she was wiping
[1:36:18] jesus' feet with her
[1:36:20] Glory Hallelujah God let me everything

[1:36:52] white and then red
[1:36:54] the devil really took a hold of him I
[1:36:56] can
[1:36:58] see oh what a rage he was breaking up
[1:37:01] his party it would ruin his
[1:37:04] church don't you know why he said look
[1:37:07] here if that man was a prophet he had
[1:37:10] know what kind of a woman that was
[1:37:11] around him listen well that would ruin
[1:37:14] his reputation no he's wrong Jesus
[1:37:17] reputation is made where Sinners are now
[1:37:21] Sinners coming to him never ruins his
[1:37:23] reputation it makes his
[1:37:25] reputation we need more of that Sinners
[1:37:28] before Jesus makes him a reputation
[1:37:30] because they're ready to repent there
[1:37:34] wiping his feet kissing his feet and she
[1:37:37] was oh show beside herself she was
[1:37:40] weeping she was going on she was just
[1:37:42] simply she didn't know what she was
[1:37:44] doing that's what we want to do get
[1:37:46] before Christ so you can lose yourself
