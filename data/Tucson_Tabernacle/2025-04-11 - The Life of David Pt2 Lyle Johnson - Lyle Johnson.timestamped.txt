[10:09] by and by.
[10:12] We are often
[10:14] destitute of the things that life
[10:17] demands. Wants of shelter and of food,
[10:21] thirsty hills and barren land. And we're
[10:25] trusting in the Lord. And according to
[10:29] his word, we will understand it better
[10:33] by and
[10:35] by. Oh, and by and by. And when the

[10:58] by and
[11:00] by and trials dark on every hand. And we
[11:05] cannot understand all the ways that God
[11:09] will lead us to that blessed promised
[11:12] land. And he guides us with his eye. And
[11:17] we'll follow till we die. And we'll
[11:20] understand it better by and
[11:24] by. Oh, and by and
[11:28] by. When the morning comes, when all the

[11:47] by and
[11:48] by. Amen. God bless you, brothers and
[11:52] sisters. Are you happy to be in church
[11:53] this evening? Amen.
[11:57] Let's stand up for one more song. We'll
[11:59] sing Just a Closer Walk with De and then
[12:01] Sister Hope, if you want to make ready
[12:02] for your special. Amen. Oh, I am weak,
[12:07] but thou art
[12:11] strong. And
[12:13] Jesus, keep me from all wrong.
[12:20] and I'll be
[12:23] satisfied as
[12:26] long. And as I walk, let me walk close
[12:32] to
[12:34] thee. Oh, and just a closer walk with
[12:43] thee. And
[12:45] granted, Jesus is my plea.
[12:51] Oh, and
[12:53] daily walking close to
[12:57] thee. Oh, let it be. And dear Lord, let
[13:03] it
[13:05] be in through in this world of toils and
[13:11] sins.
[13:15] And if I falter, Lord, who
[13:21] cares? And who with me my burden
[13:28] shares? Oh, none but thee, dear Lord,
[13:33] none but
[13:35] thee.
[13:36] Oh, and just a closer walk with thee.
[13:45] And
[13:46] granted, Jesus is my
[13:52] plea. And
[13:54] daily walking close to
[13:58] thee. Oh, let it be, dear Lord, let it
[14:04] be.
[14:07] Oh, and when my feeble life is
[14:14] old and time for me will be no more.
[14:23] and guide me gently, safely,
[14:29] oh into thy
[14:32] kingom, Lord, to thy
[14:37] shore and just a closer walk with
[14:45] thee and

[15:21] me.
[15:23] [Music]
[15:37] I
[15:38] thought number
[15:41] one would
[15:44] surely be
[15:46] me. I thought
[15:49] I could be
[15:52] what I
[15:53] wanted to
[15:56] be. I
[15:58] thought I could
[16:01] build on life
[16:04] sinking s. But I found out I can't
[16:09] even walk without you
[16:14] holding my hand. Dear Lord, I
[16:20] can't even walk without you
[16:25] holding my
[16:28] hands. The
[16:31] mountains too
[16:33] high and the valley is just too wide.
[16:40] But down on my
[16:43] knees, that's where I learned to stand.
[16:49] For Lord, I can't
[16:52] even walk without you
[16:57] holding my hand.
[17:04] I
[17:05] thought I had
[17:08] done a lot
[17:11] on my
[17:13] own. I thought
[17:16] I could make
[17:19] it
[17:21] all alone.
[17:24] I
[17:25] thought of
[17:28] myself as a
[17:31] mighty big man, but I found out I can't
[17:36] even walk without you
[17:41] holding my hand.
[17:45] Lord, I can't
[17:47] even
[17:49] walk without you
[17:52] holding my
[17:55] hand. The
[17:58] mountains too
[18:00] high and the valley is just too wide.
[18:07] But down on my knees, Lord, that's where
[18:12] I learned to
[18:16] stand. For I can't
[18:19] even walk without you
[18:24] holding my hand.
[18:28] Lord, I can't
[18:30] even
[18:32] walk without you
[18:35] holding my
[18:38] hand. The
[18:41] mountain too
[18:43] high and the valley is just too wide.
[18:50] But down on my knees, Lord, that's where
[18:55] I learned to
[18:58] stand. For I can't
[19:02] even walk without you
[19:07] holding my hand.

[23:46] requests, Sister Amelia, one request
[23:49] request from Sister Amelia. says this.
[23:52] Some of you might have watched the news
[23:55] about what happened at the Tucson House.
[23:57] All the elevators were
[23:59] down from Sunday right to right to
[24:04] Monday noon. The firefighters had to
[24:07] bring down a woman from the 15th floor
[24:11] down the stairwell with
[24:13] ropes. So, keep us in your prayers.
[24:18] Um the Tucson House is a it's a um it's
[24:22] a rough
[24:24] environment, but it's um there's God's
[24:27] seed there, and we we appreciate that.
[24:31] Brother Richard, you live there, right,
[24:33] my
[24:34] friend? Richard, I want
[24:37] everybody, especially the brothers,
[24:39] before we leave today, greet this young
[24:42] man, Richard sitting here in the back
[24:44] and gave his heart to the Lord Jesus.
[24:47] on Sunday wants to change his life. He's
[24:50] doing everything he can. He's had some
[24:53] victories this week. And brother
[24:56] Richard, look at the victories. The
[24:58] failures are always going to be there,
[24:59] my
[25:00] friend. But look at the victories that
[25:03] you have. You have overcome things this
[25:05] week. And let me tell you, now you have
[25:08] a place you can go to church that people
[25:11] love you and are going to be praying for
[25:13] you, my friend. Turn around. Look at my
[25:16] look at my friend Richard back there.
[25:18] Bless you, my friend. God bless
[25:23] you. Let me tell you something. God can
[25:27] overcome any obstacle. And he told us
[25:31] that he will not tempt you. He will not
[25:36] allow you to be
[25:37] tempted greater than you can overcome.
[25:41] So that overcoming power is within each
[25:44] of us now. We can overcome. We can
[25:47] overcome these things. We can overcome
[25:49] this temptation. We can over overcome
[25:51] this sin. We can do it. Are you with me?
[25:55] Amen. He's going to sit in the front.
[26:00] God bless you, young man. Praise God. I
[26:03] um brother brother Ed his sister
[26:07] critically
[26:09] um ill. Her and uh sister Lori, brother
[26:13] Randy were driving. She was driving and
[26:17] uh she had Daniel. It's not a heart
[26:20] attack. What is it? She had an aortic
[26:22] tear. She had an aortic tear which is um
[26:27] many many times fatal. While she was
[26:30] driving, whether Randy had to help with
[26:33] the the vehicle to get it pulled over,
[26:36] by a miracle, the EMS was there within 2
[26:42] minutes and then she was only a couple
[26:44] miles away from the best hospital in the
[26:48] entire area. So, the Lord made a way for
[26:51] her to get in there. Let me read to you
[26:55] um Brother Ed's report. But I talked to
[26:57] him a couple times today.
[27:01] Um he said
[27:05] um just wanted you to
[27:07] know that uh he talked about the prayer
[27:10] request and when I talked to him the
[27:13] first time he said that it's looking
[27:16] really
[27:17] bad. And then at 6:00 tonight, Brother
[27:22] Ed said this. He said, "The Lord is
[27:23] moving. Her kidneys are starting to work
[27:26] and her output is increasing.
[27:31] [Applause]
[27:35] Let me tell you,
[27:37] God is great. He can do anything. We all
[27:43] We all probably have to go the way of
[27:46] the grave. We We want to be in that
[27:47] generation that's raptured. And I I hope
[27:50] that we are. And I I want to be in that
[27:52] generation. But that way of of the
[27:55] grave, it is it's a it's a victory. It's
[27:59] a victory of Jesus Christ in our lives
[28:00] when we cross over.
[28:03] But while we are here on earth, the
[28:06] devil is subject to the healing power of
[28:09] Jesus Christ and he can overcome. And we
[28:12] are believing for sister Lori that
[28:14] everything would be well in her life.
[28:19] I'm uh I'm excited tonight. I believe
[28:21] the Lord,
[28:23] he's I was
[28:25] excited. We had a good service, two good
[28:28] services on Sunday. I saw a couple young
[28:32] men, this one is one of them right here.
[28:34] And I saw another young man, a few
[28:37] different people this Sunday, give their
[28:39] hearts to Jesus
[28:41] Christ. We talk about Sister Lorie's
[28:43] healing. And we believe that she is
[28:46] going to be healed, but she's going to
[28:47] get sick again. But when you give your
[28:50] heart to Jesus Christ and you truly make
[28:52] that step in your life and you truly
[28:54] make that change, then that is a forever
[28:58] eternal thing. It is over and done
[29:01] with and you are
[29:03] forever healed
[29:06] eternally in the presence of
[29:09] God. And that is where you will always
[29:12] be if you truly make that decision.
[29:17] Let's keep Sister Amelia, the Tucson
[29:19] House in prayer. Sister Lori Snow, of
[29:22] course, in prayer, our friend here,
[29:26] Richard. Let's bow our
[29:29] heads with the angels of
[29:32] God surrounding us in this
[29:38] room. If you would have a
[29:41] request on your heart that you would ask
[29:44] the Lord to do either for you or for
[29:46] someone
[29:47] else, make it known to the Lord and the
[29:51] hosts of heaven with an uplifted
[29:55] hand. Lord
[29:58] God, you see the
[30:02] hands and Lord, we praise you.
[30:06] We praise you in the
[30:08] trials. We praise you in the hard
[30:12] times. Praise you in the good times. We
[30:15] praise you in our sickness. And we
[30:17] praise you in our
[30:20] healing. Lord, we praise you with
[30:23] everything that's in us. And we thank
[30:25] you that we have a living God that we
[30:27] can pray to that
[30:29] answers us and that knows our needs.
[30:34] And we lay these
[30:35] requests at the throne of God in the
[30:38] name of Jesus Christ and ask Lord that
[30:41] you would make a
[30:43] way. Make a way for every raised hand.
[30:47] Make a way for young Richard. Make a way
[30:50] for Sister Lori. Make a way for those
[30:52] living in the Tucson
[30:55] house.
[30:57] Father, we don't know anything else to
[31:00] do than to bring it to the King.
[31:02] May these requests be granted in Jesus
[31:07] name.
[31:16] [Music]
[31:21] Amen. In Christ
[31:25] alone my hope is found.
[31:30] He is my light, my
[31:33] strength, my
[31:36] song. This corner
[31:40] stone, this solid
[31:45] ground infirm through the fiercest
[31:48] drought and storm.
[31:53] What heights of
[31:56] love, what depths of
[32:00] peace, when fears are
[32:04] still
[32:06] winding
[32:08] seas, my
[32:12] comforter, my all in all.
[32:18] And here in the love of
[32:20] Christ I
[32:24] stand in Christ
[32:27] alone who took on
[32:32] flesh in fullness of God in
[32:36] helpless
[32:38] babe. in this gift of
[32:42] love and
[32:47] righteousness and scorned by the ones he
[32:50] came to save.
[32:54] Till on that
[32:57] cross as Jesus
[33:01] died, the wrath of
[33:05] God was
[33:09] satisfied for every
[33:13] sin on him was laid.
[33:18] And here in the death of
[33:21] Christ I
[33:23] live. And there in the
[33:27] ground his body
[33:31] laid in light of the world by
[33:35] darkness
[33:38] flame and then bursting
[33:42] forth in glorious day.
[33:47] And up from the grave he
[33:49] rose
[33:52] again. And as he
[33:56] stands in
[33:59] victory and since curse has
[34:03] lost its grip on
[34:07] me for I am
[34:11] his and he is mine.
[34:16] and bought with the precious
[34:19] blood of
[34:21] Christ. No guilt in
[34:25] life, no fear in
[34:29] death. And this is the power of
[34:33] Christ in me.
[34:36] Come from life's first
[34:39] cry to final
[34:43] breath. And Jesus commands my
[34:49] destiny. And no power of
[34:53] hell. No scheme of
[34:57] man can't ever
[35:01] block me from his
[35:04] hand. till he
[35:08] returns or calls me
[35:12] home. It's here in the power of
[35:16] Christ I'll
[35:18] stand. Amen. It's only in Christ we can
[35:21] do all things.
[35:30] Amen. The Lord is my shepher. I shall
[35:35] not
[35:37] want. In green pastures he makes me lie
[35:44] down and he
[35:46] restores my soul and he leads me on for
[35:53] his
[35:55] name, for his great
[35:59] name. Cuz surely
[36:03] goodness and surely
[36:07] mercy will ride beside me all my
[36:15] days. And I will dwell
[36:19] in your house
[36:24] forever and
[36:26] bless your
[36:29] holy
[36:32] name. And you prepare a table right
[36:37] before me.
[36:41] and in the presence of my
[36:47] enemies. And though the
[36:49] airrows fly and the terror of night is
[36:55] at my
[36:57] door, I'll trust you,

[39:52] before he became king. As we begin our
[39:56] study tonight, let's join together one
[39:58] more time in
[40:02] prayer. Lord
[40:05] Jesus, it is such an

[40:10] responsibility. But Lord, it is such an
[40:12] honor to stand before the people that
[40:16] you gave your life to redeem each one.
[40:20] And Lord, as we're here joining our
[40:21] hearts together, we're here because we

[40:25] want to please you. We're here because
[40:27] we want to hear from you. We want to
[40:29] draw closer to you. We want to draw
[40:32] closer to one another. We just we're
[40:34] just so in awe of you this evening.
[40:37] Lord, I pray that you forgive us each
[40:39] one, Lord, of anything in our lives
[40:41] that's displeasing to you. Covered with
[40:43] your blood, Lord Jesus. Make us holy in
[40:47] your sight. Accept our worship. Accept
[40:49] our praise. Be present in our midst,
[40:51] Lord. Speak to our hearts. answer needs.
[40:54] Lord, we're just here to worship and and
[40:56] enjoy your presence. We thank you. We
[41:00] thank you in Jesus name.
[41:05] Amen.
[41:06] Well, we're talking about David. So, for
[41:10] our opening verses, let's read from
[41:14] Exodus
[41:16] 33. Yeah. Yeah. It's about Moses. But if
[41:20] you bear with me for a few minutes, I
[41:22] think you'll see the connection to
[41:26] David. Moses had gone to Mount Si. The
[41:30] Lord had met him there. He was gone for
[41:32] 40 days during which Aaron made a golden
[41:35] calf. Moses came down the mountain. He
[41:38] was furious with Aaron and the people
[41:40] worshiping the idol. God wasn't very
[41:42] happy either. Moses threw down the stone
[41:45] tablets and broke them, destroying them.
[41:49] Afterwards, Moses went to the
[41:51] tabernacle. He'd go in and out. The
[41:52] pillar of fire, the pillar of cloud
[41:54] would be there, and he'd go inside and
[41:58] talk to the Lord. He was seeking
[42:01] reassurance. We have the privilege that
[42:03] we can go inside with Moses and listen
[42:06] to a conversation that he had with the
[42:09] Lord. Exodus
[42:11] 33 11 we read, "The Lord spake unto
[42:15] Moses face to face as a man speaks to
[42:18] his friend." Wow. It reminds us of
[42:21] Abraham's relationship with the Lord as
[42:24] a friend. How's your relationship with
[42:26] the Lord tonight or mine? Is it real? Is
[42:31] it
[42:32] transparent? Is it trusting?
[42:36] Moses said unto the Lord, "See, thou
[42:38] thou sayest unto me, bring up this
[42:40] people. Thou hast not, let me know whom
[42:43] thou will send with me. Yet thou hast
[42:45] said, I know thee by name, and that thou
[42:48] has also found grace, favor in my
[42:50] sight." Now, therefore, I pray thee, if
[42:54] I have found grace in thy sight, show me
[42:56] now thy way, that I may know thee, that
[42:59] that I may find grace in thy sight, and
[43:02] consider that that this nation is thy
[43:06] people. And the Lord said, "My presence
[43:10] shall go with thee, and I will give thee
[43:13] rest." I I can hear Jesus voice saying
[43:18] that same thing in Matthew 11:28. Come
[43:20] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[43:22] laden. Be in my presence and I will give
[43:25] you
[43:27] rest. And and Moses said unto the Lord,
[43:30] if thy presence go not with me, carry us
[43:33] not up hence. We can't go without you,
[43:37] Lord. Wherein, how how will it be known
[43:40] here that I and thy people have found
[43:43] grace in thy sight? How will it be
[43:46] known? Is it not that thou goest with
[43:49] us, so that we shall be separated, I and
[43:52] thy people, from all the people that are
[43:55] upon the face of the earth? What marks
[43:58] that
[43:59] separation? God's presence with them.
[44:03] And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do
[44:05] this thing also that thou hast spoken,
[44:08] for thou hast found grace in my sight,
[44:11] and I know thee by name. And Moses said,
[44:14] "I beseech thee, show me thy
[44:17] glory." And the Lord said, "I will make
[44:21] all my goodness pass before thee. I will
[44:24] proclaim the name of the Lord before
[44:27] thee, and will be gracious to whom I
[44:30] will be gracious and show mercy on whom
[44:33] I will show
[44:34] mercy." Please be seated.
[44:38] The result of this conversation, what
[44:41] God will say when he proclaims his name
[44:44] to
[44:45] Moses will be referred to by David many
[44:48] times in the
[44:50] Psalms. By the way, last time I
[44:53] mentioned Moses wrote a psalm and after
[44:55] service I was asked which psalm did he
[44:57] write? It's Psalm 90. Back to Exodus.
[45:02] Let's see what happened after the Lord
[45:05] told Moses he would proclaim his name as
[45:08] we read in Exodus
[45:10] 33:19. If you have your Bible with you,
[45:13] open it to Exodus chapter
[45:18] 34. The Lord said unto
[45:22] Moses, he didn't say that. I did. He
[45:25] thee two tablets of stone like unto the
[45:28] first. And I will write upon these
[45:30] tables the words that were in the first
[45:33] tables which you broke. And be ready in
[45:36] the morning. Come up in the morning unto
[45:39] Mount Si. Present thyself there to me in
[45:42] the top of the mount. And no man shall
[45:44] come up with thee, neither let any man
[45:46] be seen throughout all the mount.
[45:49] Neither let the flocks nor herds feed
[45:51] before that
[45:53] mount. And Moses heeded two tables of
[45:56] stone like unto the first. Moses rose up
[46:00] early in the morning, went up unto Mount
[46:02] Si, as the Lord had commanded him, and
[46:05] took in his hand two tables of
[46:09] stone. And the Lord descended in the
[46:11] cloud, and stood with Moses there, and
[46:16] proclaimed the name of the Lord.
[46:21] The Lord passed by before Moses and
[46:24] proclaimed J just speak who
[46:28] proclaimed
[46:30] God. What is he
[46:32] proclaiming? His
[46:35] name previously we know Moses
[46:37] encountered the burning bush and Moses
[46:39] asked his name and he said I am. Is that
[46:43] what he's going to say
[46:45] here? Fasten your seat belt and your
[46:48] shoulder
[46:49] harness. Ready? God's going to throw a
[46:53] lightning bolt here and it will race
[46:55] across time and strike deep into the
[46:57] heart of David as we'll see this
[47:00] evening. The Lord passed by him and
[47:02] proclaimed Yahweh the Lord Yahweh the
[47:07] Lord
[47:08] God. And now the Lord Yahweh attaches
[47:12] attributes to be associated with his
[47:15] name. not more names but attributes of
[47:19] his character that he wants Moses and
[47:21] all of us to know in this instance where
[47:25] he himself is proclaiming his name.
[47:30] The Lord God, merciful also means
[47:34] compassionate,
[47:36] gracious,
[47:38] long-suffering, abundant and goodness
[47:42] and
[47:43] truth, keeping mercy also loving
[47:46] kindness is that word for
[47:49] thousands, forgiving iniquity, offenses
[47:53] and
[47:54] transgressions, crimes and
[47:57] sin. and that will by no means clear the
[48:00] guilty. Our actions carry
[48:04] consequences. Visiting the iniquity of
[48:06] the fathers upon the children and upon
[48:08] the children's children to the third and
[48:10] fourth generation. Brother Daniel taught
[48:13] about generational curses a few weeks
[48:15] ago. And Moses made haste and bowed his
[48:18] head toward the earth and worshiped.
[48:24] Last time we looked at Psalm 23, David's
[48:27] shepherd background and Psalm 59, his
[48:30] reaction to being surrounded by
[48:32] assassins sent by
[48:35] Saul. As I was researching the life of
[48:38] David, I remembered something I did as a
[48:40] teenager. One of my sons reminds me and
[48:43] says, "Dad, from time to time, you have
[48:45] to share life experiences. You got to
[48:47] share something in yourself.
[48:49] So, please bear with me for a moment
[48:51] while I do just
[48:58] that. Step back with me to the spring of
[49:02] 1967. My family had moved here from
[49:04] California a few months earlier. I was
[49:06] 17 years old, a junior at Palaverie High
[49:09] School here in Tucson. At that time, it
[49:12] was the easternmost high school campus
[49:14] in Tucson. The school was severely
[49:17] overcrowded with 6,000
[49:20] students. As a result, they ran double
[49:23] sessions. If you live north of 22nd
[49:25] Street, then the school year that year
[49:28] was from 6:00 a.m. until noon. If you
[49:30] live south of 22nd Street, you went from
[49:32] 12:30 to 6:30 p.m. That way, they could
[49:35] only have 3,000 students in the school
[49:38] instead of 6. I was fortunate to attend
[49:41] the first session, though I'll admit
[49:42] being outside for PE at 10 minutes past
[49:45] 6 in the morning in February wasn't
[49:48] exactly
[49:49] comfortable. Anyway, one of the required
[49:52] courses for high school juniors at that
[49:55] time anyway was United States history.
[49:58] My history teacher was a man named Mr.
[50:01] Odell. When we got to the Civil War, Mr.
[50:04] Rodell told the class who each had to
[50:06] pick a subject, a a battle or a person
[50:08] and give an oral report to the class.
[50:10] The report should be about five
[50:13] minutes. I don't know how, but I ended
[50:16] up with Abraham Lincoln as my
[50:19] subject. I didn't want to talk about a
[50:22] log cabin and muddy footprints on the
[50:24] ceiling, splitting logs, being a
[50:27] railroad lawyer, having an unhappy wife,
[50:30] being president during the war, being
[50:32] killed. I was a Christian.
[50:35] I wanted to know and present as part of
[50:37] my talk what motivated
[50:40] Lincoln. Were the things he did just a
[50:42] result of political calculation? What
[50:44] was in Lincoln's
[50:48] heart? I knew most history books would
[50:51] focus on events. I also knew that the
[50:54] most influential biography of Lincoln
[50:56] was written by Carl Sandberg who
[50:58] interviewed many of Lincoln's associates
[51:00] and families. The bad news is that this
[51:03] biography comprises thousands of pages
[51:05] in a six volume
[51:07] set. The first two volumes released in
[51:10] 1926 called the Prairie Years really
[51:13] tell the development of his character.
[51:15] The first 52 years of his life. The
[51:18] final four volumes re released in 1940.
[51:21] The war years are what we most remember
[51:24] about Lincoln as our 16th president. The
[51:27] last four years of his life.
[51:31] Fortunately, I discovered Sandberg later
[51:33] wrote a single volume edition that was
[51:35] only a little over 800 pages long. I
[51:38] read that one for research for my
[51:41] talk. A few days before I was scheduled,
[51:44] I told Mr. Odell that I just couldn't
[51:46] fit Lincoln into five or even 10
[51:48] minutes. He smiled, said, "I could take
[51:52] the whole period if I wanted, and
[51:55] that Lincoln was his favorite character
[51:58] in all of US
[52:00] history. Nothing like a little pressure.
[52:02] Nothing like talking about David in
[52:05] front of certain
[52:07] people." Well, the day came. Sure
[52:10] enough, I took the entire 50minute class
[52:12] period with my report. I was able to
[52:15] include a synopsis of what I thought
[52:17] motivated Lincoln, his religious
[52:19] beliefs, what they were, as part of my
[52:22] presentation. And yes, Mr. Odell was
[52:24] very
[52:27] happy. Last time we read a synopsis of
[52:30] David's life to age 30 and the death of
[52:32] Saul. Much like Lincoln's prairie years,
[52:36] these years were formative for David,
[52:38] helped shape his character, help David
[52:41] understand himself through the many
[52:44] difficulties that he
[52:45] faced. The Bible tells of David's
[52:48] formative years in 16 chapters, but like
[52:51] Sandberg's biography of Lincoln, the
[52:53] bulk of the story is of King David,
[52:56] comprising 45
[52:58] chapters. Tonight, knowing David was a
[53:02] man after God's own heart, I want to
[53:04] again look into his heart as he shared
[53:05] it through his writings, his psalms, a
[53:09] bit like we did with Psalm 23 last time.
[53:13] So, I I first want to share a psalm that
[53:17] ties in with what we just read in
[53:20] Exodus, tying it to
[53:22] David. We don't know when it was
[53:24] written. It doesn't identify itself with
[53:26] any particular episode in his life, but
[53:29] it speaks to me as coming from his
[53:31] formative years and carrying through to
[53:35] his death. It's Psalm
[53:40] 25. Psalm 25. We know a psalm is a
[53:43] melody of David.
[53:46] He says, "Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
[53:49] up my soul. Not just my words or my
[53:53] song, but the essence of my being, my
[53:56] life. I lift up my
[53:58] soul. Why, oh my God, I trust in thee.
[54:04] Let me not be ashamed. Let not my
[54:06] enemies triumph over me." This isn't
[54:09] just about David. Yay, let none that
[54:12] wait on thee be ashamed.
[54:15] I wonder if Isaiah 40:31 was inspired by
[54:18] this. They that wait upon the Lord shall
[54:20] renew their strength. Let them be
[54:23] ashamed which transgress your
[54:25] commandments, statutes, judgments, that
[54:28] transgress without
[54:31] cause. Don't let me be among them.
[54:34] Instead, show me thy ways, O Lord. Teach
[54:38] me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth.
[54:42] Teach me, for thou art the God of my
[54:45] salvation. On thee do I wait all the
[54:49] day. These two verses, four and five,
[54:52] will take us on another flashback. This
[54:54] time to
[54:55] Deuteronomy. They also remind us who
[54:58] Jesus, who loved to teach, ultimately
[55:01] paid the price to secure our
[55:04] salvation. But for now, here's the core
[55:06] belief of David based on what we just
[55:09] read in Exodus. Remember, O Lord, thy
[55:13] tender mercies and thy loving
[55:15] kindnesses, for they have been ever of
[55:18] old. Ever of old? How old? At least
[55:21] since the time of Moses, as we read in
[55:24] Exodus 34, 34:7, keeping mercy, which
[55:28] also means loving
[55:30] kindness. Remember not the sins of my
[55:32] youth, nor my transgressions, according
[55:35] to thy mercy. Remember thou me for thy
[55:38] goodness sake, O Lord. Exodus 34:7,
[55:42] keeping mercy, forgiving transgression
[55:44] and sin. Exodus 34:6, abundant in
[55:48] goodness. Good and upright is the Lord,
[55:51] therefore will he teach sinners and the
[55:54] way. The meek, the humble, will he guide
[55:58] in judgment, and the meek, will he teach
[56:00] his
[56:02] way. Lord, help us to be teachable, not
[56:06] proud, not arrogant.
[56:09] All the paths of the Lord are mercy and
[56:12] truth unto such as keep his covenant and
[56:14] his testimonies. Again, Exodus 34:6,
[56:17] merciful, abundant in truth. For thy
[56:21] name's sake, oh Lord, pardon mine
[56:24] iniquity, for it is great. Exodus 34:7,
[56:28] forgiving iniquity. These are attributes
[56:32] that God associated when he proclaimed
[56:35] his name.
[56:38] What man is he that fearth the Lord? Him
[56:40] shall he teach in the way that he shall
[56:42] choose? His soul shall dwell at ease.
[56:46] Exodus 33:14 we read, "I will give thee
[56:49] rest, and his seed shall inherit the
[56:52] earth. The secret of the Lord is with
[56:54] them that fear him, and he will show
[56:56] them his covenant. Mine eyes are ever
[57:00] toward the Lord, for he shall pluck my
[57:02] feet out of the
[57:04] net." Turn thee unto me. Have mercy upon
[57:07] me, for I am desolate and
[57:10] afflicted. The troubles of my heart are
[57:13] enlarged. Oh, bring thou me out of my
[57:17] distresses. Look upon mine affliction
[57:19] and my pain. Forgive all my
[57:23] sins. Exodus 34. Again, consider mine
[57:26] enemies, for they are many. They hate me
[57:29] with cruel hatred. Oh, keep my soul and
[57:32] deliver me. Let me not be ashamed, for I
[57:35] put my trust in thee. Let integrity and
[57:38] uprightness preserve me, for I wait on
[57:42] thee. Redeem me, who? David? No. No. The
[57:48] nation. Redeem Israel, oh God, out of
[57:51] all his troubles.
[57:54] We see in this psalm David's appeal to
[57:57] the attributes the Lord associated with
[57:59] his name when he declared it to Moses on
[58:05] Sinai. By the way, I mentioned this
[58:08] psalm has links to
[58:11] Deuteronomy. And in fact, there's a very
[58:13] important controversy regarding Moses
[58:16] having serious impact on David and his
[58:20] ability to write any of the
[58:24] psalms. Heather tells me to slow
[58:27] down. I was going to put this off for a
[58:30] future meeting, but every time I tried
[58:32] to go around it, Lord, we've had too
[58:34] much background here. We need to get
[58:35] more. There'd be a wall. Wouldn't have a
[58:39] door. Wouldn't have a window. be a wall,
[58:42] come back. Every time I tried to get
[58:44] over it, around it, under it, couldn't
[58:47] do it.
[58:48] So, kept coming back to it. So, we'll go
[58:50] through it as part of our framework of
[58:53] and foundation for David's life. Let
[58:57] let's reread for a moment just Exodus
[58:59] 34:1 and then we'll skip to Deuteronomy
[59:02] 6.
[59:05] The Lord said unto Moses, "Hue thee two
[59:07] tables of stone like unto the first, I
[59:10] will write upon these tables the words
[59:12] that were in the first tables which you
[59:16] broke. Something's going on here.
[59:19] Deuteronomy
[59:21] 6, Moses is speaking." Now, these are
[59:24] the commandments, the statutes, and the
[59:27] judgments, which the Lord your God
[59:29] commanded me, Moses, to teach you, that
[59:33] you might do them in the land whether
[59:35] you go to possess
[59:38] it. For what purpose? That thou mightest
[59:41] fear the Lord thy God? To do what? keep
[59:46] all his statutes and his commandments,
[59:48] which I command thee, thou and thy son,
[59:50] and thy son's son, all the days of thy
[59:53] life, and that thy days may be
[59:56] prolonged. Hear therefore, O Israel, and
[1:00:00] observe to do
[1:00:01] it. Why? That it may be well with thee,
[1:00:06] that you may increase mightily, as the
[1:00:09] Lord God of thy fathers hath promised
[1:00:11] thee, and the land that flowth with milk
[1:00:14] and honey.
[1:00:16] And now the most basic tenant Jesus said
[1:00:21] was the greatest commandment of all on
[1:00:23] which hang all the law and the
[1:00:26] prophets. Here O Israel, the Lord our
[1:00:31] God is one Lord. Thou shalt love the
[1:00:35] Lord thy God with all thine heart and
[1:00:38] with all thy soul and with all thy
[1:00:40] might.
[1:00:42] This is known as the
[1:00:45] schma. Schma is is a Hebrew word. It's
[1:00:48] an imperative. It's a
[1:00:51] command. It doesn't mean listen. It
[1:00:55] means
[1:00:56] listen. It means pay attention. It means
[1:00:59] hear
[1:01:02] Israel. And verse four in Hebrew is
[1:01:05] schma is adoni elohu. Adoni
[1:01:10] Aad. In Judaism, the name of God,
[1:01:13] Yahweh, it's never spoken. Instead, they
[1:01:17] substitute the word Adonai, which means
[1:01:20] Lord, or Hashem, which means the name.
[1:01:24] When I lived in Israel, rode the bus
[1:01:27] from Natana to Tel Aviv early in the
[1:01:29] morning to catch the LL worker bus to go
[1:01:31] to work at the Bengurian airport, the
[1:01:34] national radio station, Cole Israel, the
[1:01:37] voice of Israel, would come on the air.
[1:01:40] And when they came on the air, it began
[1:01:43] with singing the
[1:01:45] Schma Israel. Hashem Elohu. Hashem
[1:01:50] Elohu.
[1:01:53] Hashem
[1:01:56] is Hashem.
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:00] Elohm. Hashem.
[1:02:03] Elohu. Hashem.
[1:02:07] Amen. If you listen to the radio in
[1:02:09] Israel and you woke up in the morning,
[1:02:11] that's what you would hear. Every day in
[1:02:14] Israel when the station came on every
[1:02:16] day riding on the bus that's what I
[1:02:18] heard Israel the Lord our God the Lord
[1:02:21] is
[1:02:22] one very
[1:02:25] important Moses goes on in Deuteronomy
[1:02:28] these words which I command thee this
[1:02:29] day shall be
[1:02:32] where on a bookshelf someplace in the
[1:02:36] temple
[1:02:37] tabernacle synagogue church no there to
[1:02:42] be in thine
[1:02:44] heart. And
[1:02:45] thou, not the school system, not the
[1:02:49] priest, not the pastor, not the church,
[1:02:52] but thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:02:56] unto thy children. Whose children? Thy
[1:03:00] children. This is a parental
[1:03:03] responsibility.
[1:03:05] Thou shalt talk of them when thou sitest
[1:03:07] in thine house, when thou walkest by the
[1:03:10] way, when thou liest down, and when thou
[1:03:12] riseest up. We see this precept in many
[1:03:15] of David's
[1:03:17] psalms. And thou shalt bind them for a
[1:03:20] sign upon thine hand, and they shall be
[1:03:22] as frontlets between thine eyes. This
[1:03:26] photo is of an Israeli soldier wearing
[1:03:28] the traditional felactories during
[1:03:30] morning prayers. The schma is on tiny
[1:03:33] scrolls and the boxes on his head
[1:03:36] strapped to his
[1:03:38] arm. And thou shalt write them upon the
[1:03:40] post of thy house and on thy
[1:03:43] gates. This photo is of a muza which by
[1:03:47] the way is the Hebrew word for doorpost
[1:03:49] and it contains the
[1:03:52] schma. Well, brother Lyle, you said
[1:03:54] there was a controversy about Moses.
[1:03:57] What's the controversy and how does it
[1:03:59] affect David in the Psalms? Thank you
[1:04:02] for
[1:04:03] asking. Scholars will generally tell you
[1:04:06] that the Hebrew alphabet in its
[1:04:08] primitive form seems to have come into
[1:04:10] being about 900
[1:04:12] BC, maybe a little before, and it
[1:04:15] evolved after that
[1:04:17] time. Well, here's the problem. If there
[1:04:19] was no Hebrew alphabet, how could God
[1:04:21] have written on stone tablets for Moses
[1:04:23] around 1440 BC?
[1:04:27] How could Moses have read it? How could
[1:04:30] David have written the Psalms with no
[1:04:32] alphabet for Hebrew until decades after
[1:04:34] his death in 970
[1:04:37] BC? Well, was it just oral tradition
[1:04:40] that was later
[1:04:42] transcribed? Well, if that's the case,
[1:04:45] then why did Jesus attest to Moses
[1:04:47] having written the Torah? John five he
[1:04:50] says if you had believed Moses you would
[1:04:54] have believed me for he spoke no he
[1:04:58] testified no Jesus specifically says
[1:05:01] Moses wrote of me and just to be sure
[1:05:05] this wasn't a mistake he repeats this
[1:05:07] assertion but you believe not his
[1:05:11] writings how shall you believe my
[1:05:14] words so what gives
[1:05:20] The short version is that a
[1:05:23] protocontinental alphabet, it means a
[1:05:25] prototype of an alphabet based on sound,
[1:05:28] appeared as graffiti found in turquoise
[1:05:30] mines in the Sinai at a place called
[1:05:33] Sarah Elcadim, written about 1850 BC.
[1:05:36] That's it's right
[1:05:38] here. 1850 BC. Does that remind you of
[1:05:42] anyone that we talked about the last
[1:05:43] couple of months?
[1:05:45] maybe some guy named Joseph. And by
[1:05:48] about 1800 BC, it appeared inside
[1:05:50] southern Egypt in a place called Wadi
[1:05:53] Elho. And these are not hieroglyphs.
[1:05:56] These are not pictograms. These are an
[1:06:00] alphabet. By around 1450 BC,
[1:06:04] inscriptions using this alphabet
[1:06:07] disappeared from Egyptian territory
[1:06:09] about the same time that the Jewish
[1:06:12] people disappeared from that territory.
[1:06:14] And shortly after this alphabet starts
[1:06:16] appearing up here in Canaan and around
[1:06:20] 1450 BC. Isn't that about the time of
[1:06:23] the
[1:06:27] Exodus? Various scholarly endeavors
[1:06:30] endeavors suggested, oh that's
[1:06:32] Phoenician. It's not Hebrew. It didn't.
[1:06:34] But it didn't appear in Phoenicia until
[1:06:36] centuries after it appeared in
[1:06:39] Canaan. I'm sure you can read that.
[1:06:43] the Vi Lhole inscription. These
[1:06:45] inscriptions have been translated as if
[1:06:47] they were writing in Hebrew rather than
[1:06:49] some other Seemetic language. And the
[1:06:51] translations are readable if they're
[1:06:53] treated as Hebrew. That is, they're
[1:06:55] phrases and sentences. In this
[1:06:59] case, that stuff going across the middle
[1:07:01] there says, "Wine is more abundant than
[1:07:04] the daylight, than the baker, than a
[1:07:06] free man."
[1:07:08] Put it another way, it appears that
[1:07:11] during the time of
[1:07:12] Joseph, who is so wise and discerning as
[1:07:15] you asked Pharaoh, an alphabet appeared
[1:07:19] in the Western Sinai, associated with
[1:07:22] Egypt, and readable as
[1:07:25] Hebrew. Note, the alphabet is perhaps
[1:07:28] the greatest invention of all time,
[1:07:30] still in use by billions of people, some
[1:07:33] 4,000 years after its invention. Anyone
[1:07:36] here ever text
[1:07:39] Yeah. 4,000 years
[1:07:44] later. This doesn't prove that Moses
[1:07:47] wrote the Torah, but it is almost
[1:07:50] irrefutable evidence that he could have.
[1:07:53] He had the tools. Moses had the
[1:07:57] education, and there was an alphabet
[1:07:59] suitable for Hebrew expression.
[1:08:02] If we're to believe the Exodus account,
[1:08:04] God himself wrote in stone using this
[1:08:08] very
[1:08:09] alphabet. It had to be writing that
[1:08:12] Moses could
[1:08:15] read. If you get a chance, I recommend
[1:08:18] you watch this film or video, The Moses
[1:08:21] Controversy. If you like scholarly
[1:08:23] research, you might want to read
[1:08:25] Petravich's The World's Oldest Alphabet.
[1:08:28] This one will probably keep you awake.
[1:08:30] This one, not so much.
[1:08:33] Of course, it's one thing to demonstrate
[1:08:36] that an alphabet existed long before
[1:08:38] many are willing to agree it was Hebrew
[1:08:40] rather than just a general Seemetic
[1:08:41] alphabet. What effect does all this have
[1:08:45] on
[1:08:48] David? Thank you for asking that one
[1:08:51] too. David wasn't a well-educated person
[1:08:54] like Moses. David was the youngest of
[1:08:56] eight boys in a family of shepherds. We
[1:08:59] don't know if his dad Jesse was a
[1:09:01] wellto-do landowner or a semi-nomadic
[1:09:04] sheep herder in the area of
[1:09:06] Bethlehem. But for David to write psalms
[1:09:10] as a young man tending sheep or or
[1:09:13] hiding in a cave from his enemies, he
[1:09:16] would have to be
[1:09:18] literate. We're usually told that people
[1:09:20] 3,000 years ago were illiterate
[1:09:22] subsistence farmers that only
[1:09:24] well-educated scribes and other educated
[1:09:26] officials could read and write.
[1:09:29] But let's get back to what we just read
[1:09:33] in
[1:09:36] Deuteronomy. And thou shalt write them
[1:09:39] upon the posts of thy house and on thy
[1:09:42] gates. The Lord's command through Moses
[1:09:45] to the illiterate slave population
[1:09:48] camped in the Sinai is that the people
[1:09:50] should write these commandments on their
[1:09:52] doorposts and on their gates and always
[1:09:55] keep them in their heart and teach them
[1:09:56] to their children.
[1:09:58] God didn't say go to Walmart and buy a
[1:10:01] muza. He didn't say pay a Levite to make
[1:10:04] one for you or hire a professional to
[1:10:06] paint them on your gates. He was
[1:10:09] commanding the people to become
[1:10:12] literate. Thou second person, personal
[1:10:16] singular pronoun, thou shalt write them
[1:10:19] upon the posts of thy house and on thy
[1:10:24] gates.
[1:10:25] With the gift of the alphabet, a
[1:10:27] phonetic system of writing based on
[1:10:29] sounds, they could learn to do just
[1:10:32] that. I suspect being camped for 40
[1:10:36] years eating mana, they had time to
[1:10:40] learn, just as Moses had time to write
[1:10:44] the penetuk.
[1:10:47] I think Jesse was an ardent believer in
[1:10:49] the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
[1:10:51] that his father taught him and that he
[1:10:53] in turn taught his sons, including his
[1:10:55] youngest,
[1:10:56] David. David will write in many psalms
[1:10:59] that he has hidden the words and
[1:11:00] teachings of the Lord in his heart. And
[1:11:03] under Samuel is a prophet and the last
[1:11:05] of the judges. I suspect the word of the
[1:11:07] Lord was kept alive in David's youth.
[1:11:11] All of which is to say that it is not a
[1:11:13] stretch to accept that there was a
[1:11:15] functional alphabet of the Hebrew
[1:11:16] language and David knew it well enough
[1:11:20] to write his
[1:11:21] compositions. Being a shepherd, he had
[1:11:24] access to animal skins to use as
[1:11:27] parchment. None of this would be
[1:11:29] possible without both an alphabet and
[1:11:32] literacy. The former provided starting
[1:11:36] in the time of Joseph a means so Moses
[1:11:38] could write the Torah and the latter a
[1:11:41] result of the commandments of God
[1:11:43] through Moses that the people be at
[1:11:44] least somewhat
[1:11:46] literate. Jesse was probably a good
[1:11:49] teacher. David a bright student
[1:11:51] motivated by a love of God deep within
[1:11:53] his heart.
[1:12:00] With this is
[1:12:02] background. Finally, brother Lyle, let's
[1:12:05] move on with David's life. As noted last
[1:12:08] time, after David's victory over
[1:12:10] Goliath, Saul became jealous of David.
[1:12:13] God allowed an evil spirit to possess
[1:12:15] Saul, who became a very unstable,
[1:12:16] bipolar person. When he was agitated,
[1:12:19] David would play music to calm Saul. But
[1:12:22] eventually, Saul tried to kill David,
[1:12:25] even as he was trying to soothe Saul.
[1:12:28] David fled to his house. Saul sent
[1:12:30] assassins and Michael saved David's
[1:12:32] life. That was in 1st Samuel 19. We went
[1:12:34] through that last time. We read Psalm 59
[1:12:38] written at the time of or a memory of
[1:12:40] that time when the assassins came to
[1:12:42] kill him at his
[1:12:44] home. Let's go to chapter 20. David
[1:12:47] comes to his friend Jonathan, the crown
[1:12:49] prince, heir of the dynasty of Saul, son
[1:12:53] of Kish, trying to understand why Saul's
[1:12:56] trying to kill him.
[1:12:58] 1st Samuel 20:1 David fled from Naoth
[1:13:02] and Ramo where he had gone to be with
[1:13:03] Samuel after he escaped from the
[1:13:05] assassins in chapter 19. He came and
[1:13:08] said before Jonathan who is his friend
[1:13:11] the crown prince, "What have I done?
[1:13:15] What is mine iniquity? What is my sin
[1:13:17] before thy father that he seeks my
[1:13:21] life?" And Jonathan said to David, "God
[1:13:25] forbid, thou shalt not die. Behold, my
[1:13:28] father will do nothing, either great or
[1:13:30] small, but he'll show it to me. Why
[1:13:32] should my father hide this thing from
[1:13:34] me? It's not so. David, you're mistaken.
[1:13:36] You're just a little
[1:13:39] paranoid. David swear, moreover, and
[1:13:41] said, "Thy father certainly knoweth that
[1:13:43] I have found grace in thine eyes." And
[1:13:46] he says, "What? Not Jonathan knoweth
[1:13:48] this, lest he be grieved. He knows we're
[1:13:51] friends. He's keeping his intent hidden
[1:13:53] from you, Jonathan. But truly as the
[1:13:55] Lord liveth, as thy soul liveth, there's
[1:13:57] but a step between me and
[1:14:00] death. Jonathan, he really, really,
[1:14:03] really wants to kill me. This isn't
[1:14:05] paranoia. It's
[1:14:08] true. Jonathan said to
[1:14:10] David, "Whatever thy soul desireth, I
[1:14:13] will even do it for thee." So, they
[1:14:16] hatch a plan. What are we going to do to
[1:14:19] decide whether David's just paranoid or
[1:14:22] whether Jonathan is ignorant of what his
[1:14:24] dad wants to do? So, they come up with a
[1:14:26] plan for Jonathan to determine if
[1:14:29] David's correct or not. Skip down to
[1:14:32] verse 27. It came to pass on the
[1:14:35] tomorrow, which was the second day of
[1:14:37] the month, that David's place at the
[1:14:40] king's table was empty. Saul said unto
[1:14:43] Jonathan his son, "Wherefore cometh not
[1:14:47] the son of Jesse to meet neither
[1:14:50] yesterday nor today? Why isn't David
[1:14:53] here at my table eating with
[1:14:56] us?" Jonathan answered Saul, "David
[1:14:59] earnestly asked me leave to go to
[1:15:02] Bethlehem." He said, "Let me go, I pray
[1:15:04] thee, for our family has a sacrifice in
[1:15:06] the city, and and my brother, he's
[1:15:08] commanded me to be there. Now, if I
[1:15:11] found favor in thine eyes, Jonathan, let
[1:15:14] me get away, I pray thee, and see my
[1:15:16] brothers. Therefore, he cometh not to
[1:15:18] the king's table.
[1:15:21] Then Saul's
[1:15:23] anger was kindled against
[1:15:26] Jonathan, and he said unto
[1:15:28] him, using vile, foul, shocking
[1:15:35] language, thou son of the perverse,
[1:15:37] rebellious woman, do not I know that
[1:15:40] thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to
[1:15:42] thine own confusion, and under the
[1:15:44] confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
[1:15:46] Don't you get it, boy? How can you be so
[1:15:49] stupid? For as long as the son of Jesse
[1:15:52] liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not
[1:15:54] be established, nor thy kingdom. The
[1:15:56] Kish dynasty will end with me, you'll
[1:15:58] never be king. Do you get it now,
[1:16:01] boy? Wherefore now send and fetch David
[1:16:04] unto me, for he shall surely
[1:16:08] die. Jonathan answered Saul his father,
[1:16:12] and said unto
[1:16:13] him, Wherefore shall he be slain? What
[1:16:17] has he
[1:16:18] done? Saul cast a javelin at Jonathan to
[1:16:22] smite him, whereby Jonathan knew what
[1:16:24] was determined of his father to slay
[1:16:27] David. Skipping to verse
[1:16:30] 42, Jonathan said to David, "Go in
[1:16:34] peace, for as much as we have sworn both
[1:16:36] of us in the name of the Lord, saying,
[1:16:38] The Lord be between me and thee, and
[1:16:41] between my seed and thy seed
[1:16:44] forever." And David arose and departed.
[1:16:47] Jonathan went into the city, Gibia,
[1:16:51] Saul's
[1:16:53] headquarters. David now knows that as
[1:16:57] long as Saul is alive, David will have
[1:16:59] to either kill him or run and hide from
[1:17:03] him. David won't kill or harm Saul, the
[1:17:06] Lord's anointed king. So, he'll have to
[1:17:09] become a fugitive for as long as it
[1:17:12] takes.
[1:17:13] Now comes chapter 21, which contains
[1:17:15] events that inspire at least two
[1:17:21] psalms. 1st Samuel
[1:17:24] 21:1, "Then came David to Knob, a city
[1:17:28] of priests, it's just two or three miles
[1:17:30] from Giba, to Ahemc the priest. And
[1:17:34] Ahemc was afraid at the meeting of David
[1:17:36] and said to him, "Why art thou alone and
[1:17:41] no man with
[1:17:43] thee?" So here we see Knob. It's just a
[1:17:46] few miles from Gibia, Saul's
[1:17:48] headquarter, where David had just met
[1:17:49] with Jonathan. He's not very far away.
[1:17:52] He's
[1:17:54] running. And David made up a
[1:17:57] story. and said to him the priest, "The
[1:18:01] king hath commanded me a business, and
[1:18:03] hath said unto me, let no man know
[1:18:05] anything of the business whereabout I
[1:18:07] send thee, and what I have commanded
[1:18:09] thee. I have appointed my servants to
[1:18:11] such and such a place." Now, therefore,
[1:18:14] what is under thine hand? Give me five
[1:18:16] loaves of bread in my hand, or what
[1:18:18] there is present. I'm hungry. I left in
[1:18:22] such a hurry, I didn't have time to grab
[1:18:23] any food."
[1:18:26] And the priest answered David and said,
[1:18:30] "There's no common bread under mine
[1:18:32] hand. There's hallowed bread. The young
[1:18:35] men have kept themselves at least from
[1:18:37] women." And David answered the priest
[1:18:38] and said unto him, "Of a truth, the
[1:18:40] women have been kept from us about these
[1:18:42] three days since I came out." And and
[1:18:44] the vessels of the young men are holy,
[1:18:45] and the bread is in a manner common.
[1:18:47] Yay, though it were sanctified this day
[1:18:50] in the vessel. David's making all this
[1:18:52] up as he converses with the Himch the
[1:18:56] priest. So the priest gave David
[1:18:58] hallowed bread for there was no bread
[1:19:00] there but that which is called the shoe
[1:19:02] bread that was taken from before the
[1:19:05] Lord to put hot bread in the day when it
[1:19:07] was taken away. So this bread is
[1:19:08] sanctified only the priests are allowed
[1:19:10] to eat it but David's hungry and so he
[1:19:13] makes a deal gets the bread. Jesus
[1:19:16] referred to this event in the Gospels
[1:19:17] when challenged about plucking grain to
[1:19:19] eat on the
[1:19:21] Sabbath. Now a certain man of the
[1:19:24] servants of Saul was there that day,
[1:19:27] detained before the Lord, and his name
[1:19:30] was Doe and Edomite, the chiefest of the
[1:19:32] herdman that belonged to
[1:19:34] Saul. Doig will play a role in the next
[1:19:37] chapter and inspire another psalm when
[1:19:41] David learns a very bitter lesson.
[1:19:48] And David said unto
[1:19:50] Aimilec, "And is there not here under
[1:19:53] thine hand spear or sword? I I have
[1:19:55] neither brought my sword nor my weapons
[1:19:57] with me because the king's business
[1:19:59] required
[1:20:02] haste." The priest said, "The sword of
[1:20:06] Goliath the Philistine, whom thou
[1:20:08] slewest in the valley of Ela, behold, it
[1:20:10] is here wrapped in a cloth behind the
[1:20:13] ephod. If thou wilt take that, take it.
[1:20:16] There's no other sword or weapon except
[1:20:19] that one here. And David said, "Oh,
[1:20:22] there's none like that. Give it to
[1:20:25] me." And David
[1:20:28] arose and fled that day for fear of Saul
[1:20:32] and went to
[1:20:34] Akish, the king of Gath.
[1:20:37] You don't often find David
[1:20:40] motivated being animated by
[1:20:48] fear. So here you can see where Knob is
[1:20:51] and he goes outside the territory
[1:20:54] outside the brown border. He's now in
[1:20:56] Philistine
[1:20:57] territory and he goes to
[1:21:01] Gath.
[1:21:03] Gath, the servants of Akish. Akish is
[1:21:07] the name of the king. Just like Senus is
[1:21:10] the name of a pharaoh. So Akish is the
[1:21:13] name of a of a king and they call the
[1:21:16] king's title instead of Pharaoh, they
[1:21:18] call him Aimilec. The servants of Akish
[1:21:21] said unto him, "Is not this David, the
[1:21:24] king of the land? Did they not sing one
[1:21:28] to another of him in dances, saying,
[1:21:31] Saul has slain his thousands, and David
[1:21:33] his
[1:21:36] 10,00ands?" David laid up these words in
[1:21:39] his heart and was sore afraid of Akish,
[1:21:44] the king of
[1:21:46] Gath. David, we'll find out, was twice
[1:21:48] in Gath. This is the first time. He'll
[1:21:51] go again in 1st Samuel chapter 27, but
[1:21:54] that second time he's not
[1:21:57] afraid. Psalm 56 deals with the time he
[1:22:00] was captured by the Philistines in Gath.
[1:22:04] So let's look at it in the context of
[1:22:06] 1st Samuel 21 because as it reveals
[1:22:09] David's
[1:22:12] fear to the chief musician upon if you
[1:22:16] can pronounce that tell me how it means
[1:22:19] the silent dove in the distance it's the
[1:22:22] song it's the tune that's uh that this
[1:22:24] is to be sung to it's a mikam an
[1:22:27] inscription a poem of David when the
[1:22:30] Philistines took him in
[1:22:33] death. Be merciful unto me, oh God, for
[1:22:37] man would swallow me up. He fighting
[1:22:40] daily oppresses me. He presses the
[1:22:42] attack all day long. Mine enemies would
[1:22:45] daily swallow me up. They be many that
[1:22:48] fight against me, oh thou most high.
[1:22:51] What time I am afraid, I will trust in
[1:22:54] thee. In God I will I praise his word.
[1:22:57] In God have I put my trust. I will not
[1:23:00] fear what flesh can do unto
[1:23:04] me. Every day they rest. They twist my
[1:23:08] words. All their thoughts are against me
[1:23:10] for evil to harm me. They gather
[1:23:13] themselves together. They hide
[1:23:14] themselves. They mark my steps, spying
[1:23:17] on my movements. When they wait for my
[1:23:20] soul, hoping to kill me. Shall they
[1:23:24] escape by iniquity? In thine anger cast
[1:23:27] down the people, oh God, because of
[1:23:29] their wickedness, don't let them escape.
[1:23:31] In your anger, oh God, bring them
[1:23:34] down. Thou tellest my wanderings. Put
[1:23:38] thou my tears into thy bottle. Are they
[1:23:41] not in thy book? I don't think Dave
[1:23:44] cried. David cried very often. It's not
[1:23:47] sort of a much of a guy thing to do, but
[1:23:50] he's crying so much that his tears could
[1:23:52] be gathered in a bottle. When I cry unto
[1:23:55] thee, then shall mine enemies turn back.
[1:23:58] This I know, for God is for me, and God
[1:24:02] will I praise his word, and the Lord
[1:24:04] will I praise his word, and God I have
[1:24:06] put my trust. I will not be afraid what
[1:24:09] man can do unto me. Thy vows are upon
[1:24:11] me, oh God. I will render praises unto
[1:24:14] thee. I've made vows to you, God. I'll
[1:24:16] fulfill them with thank offerings to
[1:24:18] you. For thou hast delivered my soul
[1:24:21] from death. Wilt not thou deliver my
[1:24:23] feet from falling that I may walk before
[1:24:26] God in the light of the
[1:24:29] living? Everywhere he sees enemies. The
[1:24:33] king of Israel, Saul, wants him dead.
[1:24:36] The Philistines, enemies of Israel, want
[1:24:40] him dead. David's calling upon the Lord
[1:24:43] for help, expressing confidence that he
[1:24:45] will be helped.
[1:24:47] Back to 1st
[1:24:48] Samuel
[1:24:50] 21. The servants of Akish said unto him,
[1:24:53] "Is not this David, the king of the
[1:24:55] land? Did they not sing one to another
[1:24:57] of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain
[1:24:59] his thousands and David his 10
[1:25:02] thousands?" David laid up these words in
[1:25:04] his heart and was sore afraid of Akish,
[1:25:07] the king of Gath. When when David heard
[1:25:10] this, he realized he's in a very bad
[1:25:15] situation. Think about it. He ran in
[1:25:19] fear from Saul. He lied to a priest to
[1:25:24] get food and weapons. This will have
[1:25:27] terrible consequences. David then fled
[1:25:29] to
[1:25:30] Gath.
[1:25:32] Gath? Really? What's Gath? It's not just
[1:25:37] a Philistine city. It's the hometown of
[1:25:40] Goliath, the giant that he killed.
[1:25:44] Now the town's people are reminding
[1:25:46] Akish the king that David is the guy
[1:25:48] that killed their hometown hero
[1:25:51] Goliath. And what is David carrying as
[1:25:54] his weapon?
[1:25:56] The sword of Goliath which he told a
[1:25:58] himch the priest at no there's none like
[1:26:00] it.
[1:26:03] Oops.
[1:26:07] David calls on the Lord, but he realizes
[1:26:11] can't just sit back and wait for
[1:26:12] lightning bolts to fall or something
[1:26:15] that he gets an
[1:26:17] inspiration. I'm sure it's from the Lord
[1:26:19] to whom he has just appealed for
[1:26:22] help. And David changed his
[1:26:26] behavior before them. Feained himself
[1:26:29] mad in their hands. Scrabbled at the
[1:26:32] doors of the gate. Let a spittle fall
[1:26:34] down upon his beard. I'm not going to do
[1:26:37] that. Then said Akish unto his servants,
[1:26:41] "Lo, you see the man is mad. Wherefore
[1:26:44] then have ye brought him to me? Have I
[1:26:47] need of mad men that you've brought this
[1:26:49] fellow to play the mad man in my
[1:26:51] presence? Shall this fellow even come
[1:26:53] into my
[1:26:54] house?" David therefore departed from
[1:26:58] Gath and escaped to the cave Adulum.
[1:27:04] David composed a psalm to commemorate
[1:27:07] his escape from Akish. A song which we
[1:27:12] often sing in worship is based on this
[1:27:15] psalm. Can you guess which one it
[1:27:21] is? Psalm
[1:27:23] 34. A psalm of David when he changed his
[1:27:27] behavior before Aimilec. That's a title,
[1:27:31] right? Akish was the king's name. Biml
[1:27:34] who drove him away. I don't want this
[1:27:36] mad man in my house. And he
[1:27:39] departed. I will bless the Lord at all
[1:27:41] times. His praise shall continually be
[1:27:44] in my mouth. The modern song adaptation
[1:27:47] of this verse is let us bless the Lord
[1:27:50] every day and night. Never- ending
[1:27:52] praise. May our incense
[1:27:54] rise. My soul shall make her boast in
[1:27:57] the Lord. The humble shall hear thereof
[1:27:59] and be glad. It's all about him. It's
[1:28:02] not about us. Oh, magnify the Lord with
[1:28:06] me. Let us exalt his name
[1:28:09] together. I sought the Lord and he heard
[1:28:12] me and delivered me from all my
[1:28:17] fears. Recall first Samuel recorded,
[1:28:20] David was in fear of Akish and the
[1:28:23] Philistines there at Gath. They looked
[1:28:25] unto him and were
[1:28:27] lightened, radiant. Their faces were not
[1:28:31] ashamed. This poor man cried, and the
[1:28:34] Lord heard him, and saved him out of all
[1:28:37] his troubles. The angel of the Lord
[1:28:40] encampeth round about them that fear
[1:28:42] him, and deliverth
[1:28:44] them. David goes on to exhort the
[1:28:47] listeners of his song, the the reader of
[1:28:50] his words. Much of what follows reads
[1:28:53] like some of Solomon's proverbs. Oh,
[1:28:55] taste and see that the Lord is
[1:28:59] good. Blessed is the man that trusts in
[1:29:03] him. Fear the Lord, ye his saints, for
[1:29:07] there is no want to them that fear him.
[1:29:11] The young lions do lack and suffer
[1:29:13] hunger, but they that seek the Lord
[1:29:15] shall not want shall not lack any good
[1:29:19] thing. Come ye children, hearken unto
[1:29:23] me. I will teach you the fear of the
[1:29:26] Lord. What man is he that desireth life
[1:29:29] and loveth many days that he may see
[1:29:32] good? If that includes you, here's what
[1:29:36] I've learned and want to share with you,
[1:29:37] says
[1:29:39] David. Keep thy tongue from evil, thy
[1:29:42] lips from speaking
[1:29:45] guile. Maybe James got some inspiration
[1:29:47] from this. Depart from evil and do good.
[1:29:52] seek peace and pursue it. David
[1:29:54] certainly practiced this and his
[1:29:56] relationship with Saul. And it isn't
[1:29:58] just a don't depart from evil, but to do
[1:30:03] do good, seek peace. What did Jesus say
[1:30:05] about peace? Matthew 5:9, blessed are
[1:30:09] the peacemakers, for they shall be
[1:30:11] called the children of
[1:30:13] God. The eyes of the Lord are upon the
[1:30:16] righteous, and his ears are open unto
[1:30:19] their cry. He sees us and hears
[1:30:24] us. The face of the Lord is against them
[1:30:27] that do evil to cut off the remembrance
[1:30:30] of them from the earth. The righteous
[1:30:32] cry and the Lord hears and delivers them
[1:30:36] out of all their troubles. The Lord is
[1:30:40] nigh unto them that are of a broken
[1:30:43] heart and saveth such as be of a
[1:30:46] contrite a humble spirit. He he repeats
[1:30:49] this in another psalm after he's king
[1:30:52] that we'll look at in a future
[1:30:54] meeting. Many are the afflictions of the
[1:30:57] righteous, but the Lord deliverth him
[1:31:00] out of them all. He keepeth all his
[1:31:03] bones. Not one of them is broken. Evil
[1:31:06] shall slay the wicked, and they that
[1:31:07] hate the righteous shall be desolate.
[1:31:12] The Lord redeemth the soul of his
[1:31:15] servants, and none of them that trust in
[1:31:18] him shall be
[1:31:21] desolate. We see in this psalm a
[1:31:24] grateful and a rejoicing young David, a
[1:31:28] young man contemplating many of the
[1:31:30] larger questions of life and its
[1:31:32] purpose, growing in faith.
[1:31:36] 1st Samuel chapter 22 is full of events
[1:31:39] that result in Psalms again giving us
[1:31:42] further insight into young David's heart
[1:31:44] as he grows and matures in preparation
[1:31:48] for becoming
[1:31:49] king. God willing we'll continue with
[1:31:52] that chapter next
[1:31:54] time. What sort of lessons are there
[1:31:57] here for us? There are many but what
[1:32:00] strikes me is we see David held
[1:32:02] unwavering faith and confidence in the
[1:32:06] Lord. But David in conjunction with his
[1:32:10] faith and reliance on the Lord always
[1:32:13] took
[1:32:14] action. When the assassins were
[1:32:16] surrounding his home, he escaped, sought
[1:32:18] refuge with
[1:32:19] Samuel. When he realized he'd made a
[1:32:22] mistake in coming to Gath, he took
[1:32:24] action. He was always learning.
[1:32:28] learning from his
[1:32:29] successes and learning from his
[1:32:32] mistakes,
[1:32:34] growing, maturing. The musicians would
[1:32:37] would please return. I've noticed many
[1:32:40] times Christians saying things along the
[1:32:41] line of, "I can't do anything. Jesus has
[1:32:44] to do it for me." But Paul wrote in
[1:32:47] Philippians, "I can do all things
[1:32:50] through Christ who strengthens me."
[1:32:52] Amen. When I first started writing
[1:32:55] software back in the 1970s, I learned of
[1:32:58] something called an infinite loop. It it
[1:33:00] must be avoided in coding or the program
[1:33:03] will lock up and fail. It it looks
[1:33:05] something like this. Step one, turn on
[1:33:08] the light. Step two, go to step
[1:33:12] one. You never escape the loop. You
[1:33:15] never find out what step three might be.
[1:33:18] The Apostle Paul said as much in Hebrews
[1:33:20] admonishing them to exercise their
[1:33:22] faith. Hebrews 5:12 he says for the when
[1:33:26] for the time you ought to be teachers
[1:33:28] you have need that one teach you again
[1:33:30] which be the first principles of the
[1:33:33] oracles the word of God and are become
[1:33:35] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:33:37] strong meat. Paul says you're in an
[1:33:41] infinite
[1:33:42] loop. Everyone that uses milk is
[1:33:45] unskillful in the word of righteousness.
[1:33:47] He's a babe. Strong meat belongth to
[1:33:50] them that are full age, of full age. Not
[1:33:53] old by reason of years, but even those
[1:33:55] who by reason of use have their senses
[1:33:58] exercised to discern both good and
[1:34:02] evil. If you find yourself choking on
[1:34:04] the meat, chew a little more. Take a
[1:34:07] smaller bite next time. But don't give
[1:34:10] up. Learn from successes and failures.
[1:34:15] Paul said, "By reason of use, by
[1:34:19] doing, exercise requires
[1:34:23] effort." Brother Brandham sometimes
[1:34:26] talked of an old steam railroad
[1:34:29] locomotive. Once you light the fire,
[1:34:31] build up steam in the boiler, you can
[1:34:33] blow the whistle or you can start the
[1:34:36] wheels turning and make progress. He
[1:34:39] said, "Too many of us blow off the steam
[1:34:41] through the whistle and never get the
[1:34:43] train moving.
[1:34:45] David got the train moving and so must
[1:34:49] we. I'd like to close this portion of
[1:34:52] the service by singing together a song
[1:34:54] derived from Psalm 34. If can bring it
[1:34:57] up on the screen. Let's let's stand and
[1:34:59] and worship together. The the first line
[1:35:01] is I sought the Lord and he answered
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:07] me. I sought the
[1:35:12] Lord and he answered
[1:35:16] me. He delivered
[1:35:20] me from every
[1:35:25] fear. Those who look on
[1:35:29] him are radars.
[1:35:35] know him will never be
[1:35:38] ashamed. They'll never be
[1:35:43] ashamed. This poor man
[1:35:47] cried and the Lord heard
[1:35:51] me. He saved me
[1:35:56] from my enies.
[1:36:01] The son of
[1:36:04] God surrounds his
[1:36:08] saints. He will deliver them.
[1:36:13] He will deliver them.
[1:36:18] Oh,
[1:36:20] magnify the
[1:36:22] Lord with me.
[1:36:27] Come,
[1:36:29] exalt his
[1:36:31] name
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:35] together.
[1:36:37] Glorify the
[1:36:39] Lord with
[1:36:43] me. Come and
[1:36:46] exalt his
[1:36:48] name forever.
[1:36:54] Oh, taste and
[1:36:57] see that the Lord is
[1:37:01] good. Oh, bless to
[1:37:05] see who hides in him.
[1:37:11] Oh, fear the
[1:37:14] Lord. Oh, all you
[1:37:18] saints. He'll give you everything.
[1:37:21] You'll lack nothing. He'll give you
[1:37:24] everything.
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:29] Magnify the
[1:37:32] Lord with
[1:37:35] me. In
[1:37:38] exalt his
[1:37:40] name together.
[1:37:46] Glorify the
[1:37:48] Lord with
[1:37:52] me. Come and
[1:37:54] exalt his
[1:37:56] name
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:02] forever. Let us bless the
[1:38:06] Lord every day and night.
[1:38:12] ever ending
[1:38:15] praise. May our
[1:38:17] hast rise. Let us bless the
[1:38:23] Lord every day and
[1:38:27] night.
[1:38:28] Neverending
[1:38:31] praise. May our incense trust.
[1:38:36] Let us bless the
[1:38:39] Lord every day and
[1:38:43] night.
[1:38:45] Neverending
[1:38:47] praise. May our
[1:38:49] incense
[1:38:52] rise bless us
[1:38:55] both every day and
[1:38:59] night.
[1:39:00] Neverending praise.
[1:39:04] They are his sins
[1:39:08] right. Oh,
[1:39:11] magnify the
[1:39:13] Lord with
[1:39:16] me. Come
[1:39:19] exalt his
[1:39:21] name
[1:39:25] together.
[1:39:27] Glorify the
[1:39:29] Lord with me.
[1:39:33] He and
[1:39:35] exalt his
[1:39:37] name
[1:39:41] forever.
[1:39:44] Amen. The great warrior David, the great
[1:39:48] poet David, the great writer
[1:39:51] David, great
[1:39:53] man David.
[1:39:57] I appreciated brother Lyall starting way
[1:40:00] back in Joseph's
[1:40:03] time and he started talking about that's
[1:40:06] that's when this alphabet this Hebrew
[1:40:10] alphabet started to manifest
[1:40:13] itself and then we see
[1:40:16] Moses record the Torah first five books
[1:40:20] of our
[1:40:21] Bible as brother Lyall was
[1:40:24] talking many People might say, "Well,
[1:40:26] the Torah is a
[1:40:29] result of the
[1:40:31] alphabet." I said,
[1:40:33] "No, I think the alphabet was a result
[1:40:37] was a
[1:40:39] result of God wanting to record his
[1:40:43] word." That's right. Made me think,
[1:40:45] brother Lyall, way
[1:40:48] back, probably, I don't know, five or
[1:40:51] six hundred years ago,
[1:40:53] um, they they came up with this great
[1:40:56] invention called the Gutenberg
[1:40:58] Press and it was never there was never
[1:41:02] it was always scribes up until then. And
[1:41:06] they came up with this machine that they
[1:41:08] could move the type. They could create
[1:41:10] these plates, put ink on it, put paper
[1:41:13] on it, and print a sheet of paper over
[1:41:16] and over and over again. What was the
[1:41:18] first thing that they printed on the
[1:41:19] Gutenberg press? The Holy
[1:41:22] Bible. The very first product all after
[1:41:26] that great invention. And I really
[1:41:29] believe that God created an alphabet so
[1:41:33] Moses
[1:41:34] could record
[1:41:36] the first books of the Bible and then
[1:41:38] we've been able to enjoy them since
[1:41:40] then. Beautiful. And then uh as King
[1:41:45] David, as brother Lyall said, maybe
[1:41:48] sitting in a cave or wherever he
[1:41:50] was using that same alphabet to write
[1:41:54] down these psalms. How how wonderful
[1:41:57] that God has everything in order. We
[1:41:59] worry about stuff, but no, he's got he's
[1:42:03] got everything in order. He knew exactly
[1:42:05] when he was going to create an alphabet.
[1:42:06] He knew exactly when he was going to
[1:42:09] create the Gutenberg press. He knew he
[1:42:11] knew all about it and he had his
[1:42:13] children in
[1:42:15] mind. I um I didn't send out my
[1:42:18] broadcast this morning. I was uh I was
[1:42:21] traveling. Um but brother Ryan, my good
[1:42:25] friend, Brother Ryan Long, will be
[1:42:27] ministering for us on Sunday morning. He
[1:42:29] and I had a really nice conversation
[1:42:30] today.
[1:42:32] um will be also ministering at a
[1:42:34] minister's meeting and he uh he said
[1:42:39] what do you think about this idea and
[1:42:41] then I shared with him the thoughts that
[1:42:44] I had on my heart and they doveetailed
[1:42:48] absolutely perfectly and brother Ryan
[1:42:50] got really excited he says brother
[1:42:51] Daniels I've been struggling I didn't
[1:42:53] know if I should or I shouldn't preach
[1:42:55] on this and then finally I just said no
[1:42:57] and and and then he said but what you
[1:43:00] said this morning he said this is
[1:43:02] exactly on my heart what I want to
[1:43:05] preach on. So we will get um the longer
[1:43:10] version of that on Sunday morning and
[1:43:12] and I know it's going to be a blessing.
[1:43:14] And also, forgive me, I forgot um
[1:43:18] earlier I forgot to mention that uh some
[1:43:23] of you know that Golden Dawn
[1:43:26] uh church, Brother Isaac Noriega, the
[1:43:29] pastor, they're on the p on the front
[1:43:32] page of the Sunday newspaper again. And
[1:43:36] um it's I think they're um they're
[1:43:39] bringing
[1:43:40] charges against one of the people in his
[1:43:42] church. I think brother Isaac is um he's
[1:43:47] caught up in it. I've never met him. In
[1:43:49] fact, I don't know anyone that goes to
[1:43:51] that church, but I know that there's
[1:43:53] some in our church that come from there.
[1:43:58] And these are embarrassing things for
[1:44:02] the
[1:44:03] congregation.
[1:44:04] And just keep these these are
[1:44:08] souls. Keep them in prayer. Always be
[1:44:11] willing. I don't care friends if they
[1:44:14] have done you
[1:44:15] wrong. Don't be afraid to reach out a
[1:44:18] hand of fellowship to them and pray for
[1:44:21] them. These are hard times for that
[1:44:24] church. So just pray pray for them. And
[1:44:29] like I said, if they've done you wrong,
[1:44:31] if you've been done wrong there, are you
[1:44:34] a Christian or are you not a Christian?
[1:44:36] If you're a Christian, then you will
[1:44:38] pray for those that may have done you
[1:44:40] wrong. and you always have a right hand
[1:44:41] to fellowship out to anyone that will
[1:44:45] come um come to you for help. So, let's
[1:44:50] let's pray for them tonight. And again,
[1:44:54] I
[1:44:55] appreciate our gallant brother Lyall and
[1:44:58] all of his work and and this message
[1:45:01] that started with an
[1:45:04] alphabet and it ended with
[1:45:08] David saying, "Just taste and
[1:45:11] see for the Lord is
[1:45:14] good."
[1:45:17] Father, we love
[1:45:19] you. Lord,
[1:45:22] it's pick
[1:45:25] up this holy Bible in my
[1:45:29] hands and see that you have preserved
[1:45:31] this word through thousands of
[1:45:34] years. That you created an alphabet that
[1:45:38] could be written
[1:45:39] down. And then Lord, even more important
[1:45:42] than that, you created scribes,
[1:45:48] prophets that you spoke through that
[1:45:52] could record this for us. We thank you,
[1:45:55] Lord. We thank you for the many writings
[1:45:59] of and about this great man, King and
[1:46:02] Prophet David.
[1:46:04] And Lord, we
[1:46:06] pray, Father, also
[1:46:09] for those
[1:46:11] that would need our prayers, Father,
[1:46:14] right now that are maybe involved
[1:46:18] in in this these accusations against the
[1:46:23] church and against certain people. Lord,
[1:46:27] I I I don't know
[1:46:29] them, but I know that you know about
[1:46:32] this situation. And we pray for the the
[1:46:35] people, Father, that your hand would be
[1:46:38] upon
[1:46:39] them. And if anyone here could be a
[1:46:41] comfort to them, that we would do
[1:46:44] so. And Lord, that that your will would
[1:46:48] be
[1:46:49] done, that your hand would be upon all
[1:46:52] all of this. and Lord that it would be
[1:46:55] for your glory and for the benefit of
[1:46:58] your people. We
[1:47:00] pray. We love you Lord. We thank you for
[1:47:03] your wonderful, beautiful, precious
[1:47:06] word. May
[1:47:08] it be on our doorposts at all times and
[1:47:11] not only on our doorpost but written on
[1:47:13] the tables of our
[1:47:15] hearts. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:47:21] Amen.
[1:47:24] Magnify the
[1:47:26] Lord with
[1:47:30] me and come
[1:47:33] exalt his
[1:47:35] name together.
[1:47:39] Oh,
[1:47:41] glorify the
[1:47:43] Lord with
[1:47:47] me and come
[1:47:50] exalt his
[1:47:52] name
[1:47:58] forever. Oh, taste and
