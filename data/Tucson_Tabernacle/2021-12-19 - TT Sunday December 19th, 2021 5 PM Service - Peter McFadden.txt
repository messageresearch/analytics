predicted that but isn't our god good to hear her sing of being in the hollow of his hands i realize those were put there by roman nails that when you're in the hollow of his hand you're just covered with his blood that's where i want to be hidden in him that cleft and the rock of ages isn't he good i want to start a little funny i want to start with an altar call just where you are maybe in your own heart you just find an altar in your heart and whatever your need is whatever your petition is just in your own way bring it to the lord and just turn to him for a few minutes now here [Music] so [Music] so [Music] lord i believe you've heard these prayers those that can't even be expressed lord you hear the hearts father we have great need of you and lord we don't want to come out of tradition or routine but lord [Music] i want the supernatural pray that you would move me aside lord close my lips for anything that's not your pure word or close these ears to hear anything that's not your pure word father would you move by your spirit down every pew in every heart lord revive us lord encourage us correct us let's leave here different lord [Music] let us live this next week different than we would have lived if we'd not been here [Music] lord let us walk a little closer to you a little more in love with you father with one another that we can make you visible lord in our lives that's our desire lord let us be pleasing to you i pray and let all this service be totally dedicated to you father in jesus name amen amen while you're standing let's turn to exodus chapter 14. 13th verse thank you musicians that saxophone player he looks awfully like our brother aaron must be his brother or something exodus chapter 14 and we'll read 13 and 14. and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he shall show will show you the today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace that's also where we're standing go to matthew 11 and 28. these are the words of jesus familiar words of comfort to us matthew 11 28 says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light praise the lord for that let's be seated unless you want to come stand up here with me then be glad for the company i wanted to talk for a few minutes i was thinking a lot about that scripture where it says be still and know that i'm god thinking about that great commandment to be still and uh it's very common for the people of the world to disobey the ten commandments and and the various things but this one could be the most disobeyed of the commandments because nobody is still nobody will will stop for a minute and if you do have to stop for a minute then the phone comes out right away and you've got to you got to occupy yourself on the phone or you got to turn the radio on or something to keep from obeying this commandment got to do something to keep from being still but in this stillness and in this rest is where god works and i want to be where he's moving i want to be just as close as i can be to that and so if i have to be still to get there the lord help me to be still help me to know that he's god and that's sure a leaf if it was up to me then you'd all be in trouble and so would i but he's god is he that made us and not we ourselves he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's got it under control so like jesus said if we come to him he'd give us this gift of rest and i want to talk about that but i don't want to turn this into a complicated explanation of a simple thing that's what lawyers like to do is they like to take the simple and they make it complicated because then you know it's money but the things of god are simple he's hidden in simplicity and the rest of god which is what we're talking about this being still and resting in him it's remarkably simple and so if if at the end of the sermon it seems more unattainable than at the beginning then forgive me and pray for me because the things of god are simple and and this this rest we know is is the holy ghost living in the holy ghost so don't don't let's make that this real complicated and difficult but let's see if we can find some encouragement in the word of god and some some wisdom in the word of god that we can tomorrow apply these scriptures to our lives and see see good fruit from that you might think i'm a little odd for for starting with a little altar call like that but i was uh i was listening to a sermon where brother branham talks against altar calls and i still kind of did it but in in the service in the sermon perfect strength by perfect weakness there's a quote that really just stood out to me because he's talking against altar calls where you you know begging drawing trying to to work somebody up emotionally and bring them to the altar but what he said i thought was remarkable and he said now the altar is the place of prayer where every person coming to the church should first go in kneel at the altar silently pray to god and offer their petition of prayer and for their loved ones and thanking god for what they have had done for them then go back to their seat and i thought what a different way to approach this this portion of our church this portion of our our lives that we don't want to make it into a tradition and and just make it formalism but what if we come to church in that attitude that atmosphere and what if we come and instead of just coming 30 minutes early or as close to that as we can just for for routine's sake what if we would come and just find an altar here or in your hearts and and what if we just start service just asking god thanking god i believe we do i don't i don't believe this is uh something that none of you do but if you're doing it i just encourage you to keep doing it and if maybe that's slipped slipped by the way over the years let me just remind you that when we come in let's let's just keep him always first on our mind and on our hearts and let's let's just start every service like that because i don't believe that this church is is just trying to maintain a baseline or just keep a status quo but i believe we're trying to go somewhere that we've never never gone before we're we're getting ready to experience something that we've never experienced before and so i'm not satisfied to maintain a level of devotion to god but we ought to be expecting more we ought to be feeling his his drawing because no man can come to god except god draw him and so it's not that we get a great idea that we should draw near to god but he's that great magnet that's going over and pulling his children and before those pieces of metal jump up in the air like like we're gonna do they start to just shake in his presence they start to feel something they start to what is this this is something new because we're living in the astronaut age when brother branham was preaching the seals and and going through all these things that god was revealing to him he could see and he he reminded us that the natural types the spiritual and he could see that in the nation one of the monumental developments in the nation where these pioneers going up into space these people these these russians and americans that were doing something totally new and brother branham said this is a sign to you church not church but this is a sign to you bride and if that was a sign then then i look at the headlines now and i saw one just within the month that said nasa selects new class of astronauts wow they're young people they're my age they're going to space and i thought isn't that right that there's not just those pioneers that went back in the 60s this word isn't just for brother branham but there's been a class of astronauts selected there's a chosen people and in the article talked about these people they've been selected and so what they're doing is they're making ready they're training they're in expectations for this blast off date and i thought my isn't that wonderful what an age this is to live in what's your 10-year plan well i've got a i've got a wedding supper in mind i hope if it's not 10 years then that'll be my next 10-year plan that'll be my next 10-year plan but i believe i'll be there i believe i'll see you there won't that be wonderful then a little farther it's quite a sermon this perfect strength by perfect weakness a little farther in there another quote that jumped out to me because it kind of ran ran a little bit in the way of the way i had understood some things but he talks about the reason we go to church and i always kind of thought we came to church to to worship the lord and i'm sure that's a part of it but listen how he put it here he said there's little things that we do and that's why we come to church for is to find out where our faults are and the things that we might better ourselves by if we go to church if we come to church for any other any other objective than this i'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to coming to church we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places and see and our see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong but when we have weaknesses and he goes on i thought my that's a good reason to come to church and that's how i want to come to church because i don't want to be deceived and i don't want to deceive myself that's they say the worst type of deception because it's true that we have great and precious promises and we ought never let anything take our eyes off of that anything that tries to shake you from that reject it but any spirit that tries to take you into a false rest that's not a rest based on this scripture and any spirit that would would take and and tell you to ignore the parts of the bible that say examine yourselves whether you be in the faith see you've got to judge every spirit and see if it runs all the way with the bible and so i wanted to talk a little bit about rest because i know i've kind of talked about this before but i think it's so important i believe it's so important that we would enter into his rest because there's only one true rest as that's his rest and we saw a man well i didn't see him but lydia saw a man on the way here that was passed out on the sidewalk now he is resting but i don't want his rest i don't want that rest that rest is deceptive because that man's in trouble sleeping is maybe not going to solve his problems but there is a rest there is this gift to the believer this gift to the bride that we can be hid in the hollows of the hands of christ and we can be in that bomb shelter made out of feathers and we can have our ticket booked on on the rocket ship out of here so let's let's just look at that rest let's let's see what the bible says about that at rest because that rest is going to take us out of here that rest is jesus the whole message is about a person it's about jesus christ everything's in him he's uh he's my insurance policy he's my retirement plan he's he's my spouse he's my father he's everything to me and believe that we're going to be gone but before that happens before we're before we're physically gone i believe that entering into this rest before we're physically gone there's gonna be a change in us that that old man is gone that there's been that same fire that came down on elijah's altar when elijah was obedient to god there was this fire that came down and it just took everything took the sacrifice and it took the rocks and it took the water i believe that for you and me i believe that the old man can be the old woman can be totally gone that we can enter into that rest not in our strivings and in our trying to to gain that but as as we can just receive this gift as we can just say yes lord i believe it as we can say i'm going to walk in obedience and though i can never do it in myself i believe that as i'm reaching out to you you'll reach out to me but as i draw near to you god you'll draw near to me and your your legs are a lot bigger than mine so i'm thankful for that this rapture that we're looking forward to that's just the last step in this walk that we're walking and so if we if we just put that all off uh to some some future day then might be disappointed when that day comes but if we can just say lord as close as i can get to that now let me get to that now and tomorrow i believe i'll get a little bit closer than that see this is this is the time more than ever before this astronaut age that we're living in this is the time to lose some weight to lay aside these things that so easily beset us because we're we're getting out of here and so it's easy to just repeat that just say yeah i know i know i know and i'll talk about that a little bit this i know we know it but here's a here's a tough question are you lighter today than you were yesterday because if you're not maybe you didn't lay anything aside yesterday this is something that we ought to be lighter day by day we ought to think more of christ day by day we ought to think less of this world day by day are we doing this let's examine let's see don't don't get discouraged if if you're not making the kind of progress that you'd like to be making but just keep pressing towards that mark of the high calling fall down well righteous man gets back up fall down get back up just keep pressing but don't stop pressing don't be lured into a false rest where you just give up too soon because the first thing they did when they went into the promised land children of israel that was their arrest you know this this type of the holy ghost this promised lamb the first thing they did is they started doing some free plastic surgery on on the inhabitants of the land and re-uh rearranging their appearance and uh they started fighting you know so we ought to be fighting like that and i was really encouraged there's a scripture in deuteronomy that i won't quote it word for word but basically what it says is when you cross this land and you're fighting for for your piece of the land right um this land has been divided up for for the different people different families and basically what it says is as you're fighting once you get your your peace cleared you keep fighting to help your brother clear his peace so maybe you're maybe this is all been there done that i've got that down well help some of the rest of us out be an encouragement to some of the rest of us your words are powerful and and the way that you can communicate love to somebody else that's important so if you've already got all this down and and help the rest of us and we'll get all the enemy cleared out and we'll just have a good time in the lord but i don't want any trouble at the river i believe we've brother branham talked about in this building that the lord's building the spirit's building he said we've turned the last corner i'm so glad for that because that means now that as we're building you know we just got to keep straight along with what we've heard we don't have to come new doctrines and new corners just just straight on but what that means is we're headed back to that original cornerstone and that brick by brick as we go we're gonna see him a little more clearly we're gonna get a little bit closer to him that we're just going on by the word and we're just believing that what he's promised us is true and we're resting in that and and what really one of the things that really got me thinking about this rest i better hurry up here i'm not even started so just pray for me um the cookies will be there don't worry i was thinking about momentum and this this movement and and basically the idea of momentum is that it ties in with newton's laws of motion his first law and what it basically says is an object at rest will stay in rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless there's an unbalanced force that acts on it and i thought wow that's interesting because you can think of momentum in the movement of a block or a ball or something like that but our lives have momentum there are portions of our lives that are going certain ways and and going down certain paths and at the same time there's that center portion of our life that's supposed to be a total rest and and what this idea of momentum in the physical world which we believe that god reveals himself in this physical world the heavens declare his glory and this is all kind of a zoomed in portion of the heavens but what it says about this this thing that's resting is that it will stay at rest as long as there's no unbalanced force so if this pulpit is is sitting here it's going to sit here until a force moves it and even then if there's a force if i'm pushing this if brother aaron comes and he's pushing two from the other side it's still gonna stay there as long as the forces are balanced that's not mine that's interesting because the thing about our rest is it's it's so beautiful that we can rest in this time when everything's going like this that we can rest but the devil always tries to trick us out of it just like he did to adam and eve where they were safe as long as they were in this protection of god's word so satan had to try to trick them out of that and so there are forces that he'll bring in your life all the time to try to push you out of rest one way or the other he doesn't care he could push you to legalism or worldliness or pride or envy or hatred or whatever it is he doesn't care just wants to get you out of that state of rest but what newton's law says is as long as there's a balanced force that will oppose that that object will stay in rest i thought wow that's wonderful because we have a promise that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard against thy whatever way it's coming from the spirit of god raises standard against that to oppose that and they keep us in rest and so i was thinking about this momentum and how do we how do we get there's the portion of our lives that are supposed to stay still and then there's a portion of life that's supposed to be going somewhere an aspect and i thought well how do we how do we affect the trajectory of our lives when when it's when it's um moved out of the wrong way and i was talking to a man that deals with uh working with children and we're talking about all the problems in the world and he he mentioned the quote that says it's it's a lot easier to steer a child the right way than it is to try to reform an adult and he was saying you know his hope was that the world is messed up and if you go to try to help the adults the adults are pretty set in their ways and so they're really hard to help but a child is still moldable and a child you can get pointed down the right path more easily i thought wow aren't we told to come as children that it's not in our wisdom to to try to figure out how to reroute our lives but let's just come with the rest of children it says lord you know just point me in the right way because the natural way is to get set in our ways and to get just going down one path better child to go i wanted to say a child will go anywhere you point them sometimes you still have to fight with kids i'll be honest with you that's that's a big part of my life but uh what what better opponents i wouldn't choose any other opponents to fight with they're pretty great but the lord knows how to deal with our with his children and when we throw a temper tantrum he knows he's got wisdom to deal with that too so don't you worry but i thought of solomon in all his wisdom he was asked for wisdom and he was granted wisdom lord answers our prayers thought of solomon and all his wisdom and look where he ended up still and that's where i was thinking of this this spirit of i know i know don't don't tell me all this again and again i know i know and that's that's kind of the refrain of the church i know i know but the bride says i do i do it's not about what you know but what do you do are we laying aside these weights are we throwing ourselves totally on his mercy i do i accept it proposal accepted that's where i want to be the battle belongs to the lord we trust in him and we know that we don't have to fear because it's our father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom there's a promise in the bible it says all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children that's for our children how much more is that for us as children of god what a great peace we have in him don't let the devil push you from that anything that would push you from that resist it oppose that look at that standard that the word raises that says no i'm just going to stay at rest all through the bible there were types of this and the sabbath the sabbath was the day of the week of course that that at the end of the week after there'd been this six days of labor there's this day of rest now we're we're there in the seventh day leaving for rest and and this was also you know in the in the years for the field the sabbath there was a sabbath year every seven years for the field that the land would rest and then jesus came and he said man wasn't made for the sabbath but the sabbath was made for man he said the son of the son of man is the lord of the sabbath he said this isn't just something that that we do for god but this is a great gift of god for us and and i thought about sometimes we waste that gift and it's easy i was talking with a man about this it's easy to um to fill our our saturdays and you know saturdays the sabbath it's it's easy to fill that with things that that steal away from that rest that's supposed to be there from that time of refreshment and renewal and appreciation for god but just as this is kind of a natural aside but don't fall for that just as we have rest in the spiritual as a spiritual people physically it's good to have a day of the week that you rest and so it can be easy caught up with even good things you know sports and and hanging out with your friends and things but try to just set aside some time just to appreciate the things of god and reset and just it's a real gift to you that the devil's trying to rob you of it so don't let him rob you of it i know i got to get away from the city yesterday and kind of reset and it was it had been too long it's easy to go a while without without doing that but then you know you think in the same way this rest that we've been given in the spiritual what are we using that for have we ceased from our works just to to forget about god and get caught up in other things or this rest that we've entered into are we just letting it be a time that we can enjoy the lord a time that we can walk with him in this cool of the evening i believe we're in that evening time i believe he's walking again among us and with us just like when isaac was going or rebecca was coming to me to isaac says he he he went out to meet her wow i believe he's done that now i believe this last stretch the journey he's come to bring us home i believe that just like eleazar pointed to rebecca and said that's the guy that's your husband didn't we have that happen we have a messenger that says there he is that's him there he is i believe we're getting real close to home in that time where it's just christ and his his bride what a day we're living in so we've got a we've got a fight to stay in that rest sounds a little bit bit funny but in galatians 5 1. if we could get that put up galatians 5 1 says stand fast therefore in the liberty where with christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage so that's in there for a reason there is a yoke of bondage that would try to tangle you up but stand fast resist that that would move you from rest keep keep pressing towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus accept this gift and hold on to it and this rest is is a total surrender of our will thy thy kingdom come thy will be done it's the way that jesus taught us to pray he taught us in luke 9 and 23 if we could get that put up we'll read verse 25 luke 9 23 jesus said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life will lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away and so we see that he said come my yoke is easy my burden's light i'll give you this rest and then he says here's how you do it you deny yourself you take up your cross you follow me we die daily like paul said we know john when john saw this one that was in the midst of the candlesticks says when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead i believe that's the correct response if we can catch a glimpse of him the old man dies away and that's that's a daily thing you know that's that's not something that we we fully surrender once and you know in a sense it is when we receive the holy ghost that you're you're eternally sealed till the day of your redemption but there's this yoke of bondage that would try to tangle you again not that you'd lose your salvation but that you could lose your rest you could lose that peace that gift of god and so i was so glad just the way that brother aaron was finishing his sermon kind of tied right into what i was thinking because i was thinking a lot about gethsemane and that's really one of the the crucial one of the most important places and the most important times in the history of the world is this little man that couldn't even be identified from among his disciples he blended in with him so well that they needed to have judas come and identify him so it wasn't this man that stood out for everyone else but he was just this kind of normal looking guy that would go up there and he would pray and i thought my because it says let's read it in luke 22 and 39 let's put it up if we could it says and he came out and went as he was one to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him let's just stay there a second those words as he was one it's kind of old english but if you read other translations it means as usual as was his custom as was his habit he didn't go to gethsemane once but this is what he always did this is how he lived and if that was the spirit moving in him moved him to do that and look at this last part his disciples also followed him that's us right we're to follow him there and so this rest the world will try to sell you a rest without a gethsemane but his rest came through gethsemane the word means the oil press the mount of olives that's where they pressed these olives crushed these olives to get the oil out of them before he was ever crushed on calvary he had a habit he had a custom to go to the oil press and it wasn't just the last day of his life that said i will be done but every every night it sounds like maybe not every night i don't know what the habit the customers but as usual he would go up there and and pray what i'd imagine would be a similar prayer not my will that i will be done see that's not the rest that the disciples had at this point he said come you know pray with me carry with me an hour their rest was just go up there and go to sleep and that's the rest of of the church there's two groups of ladies that are sleeping now just one's got oil one doesn't see one's been to the oil press gethsemane one is going to try to go later when it's too late the wise and the foolish virgins if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you won't it take you to gethsemane won't you won't it bring you to a rest by giving you the strength to take up your cross daily see we're not talking about living the way we've been living for the last 40 years 50 years talking about going up talking about a change in elevation but remember my yoke is easy my burden is light don't let this become this this thing that's a human effort it's not it's just the crushing of the olives it's just letting that old man pass away it's just letting that fire of god come and take the whole sacrifice animal rock water see when i'm gone there's not even going to be a burnt spot on the sidewalk i'm just going to be gone believe you're coming too don't push that off like the song said pleasing let me be pleasing i believe the lord is drawing my people i believe he's calling i believe these are sober times remember the quote brother branham you don't come to church just uh what am i doing wrong lord what have i not let go of what are the weights that i'm not willing to drop so you get 70's a beautiful place for the believer for the one that will say i do instead of i i know but gethsemane was worth it to christ because he looked to the joy that was set before him he wasn't going there self-centered he wasn't going there just trying to make himself anything but he's saying oh there's this this little remnant of people i would give my life for and that spirit of christ in you maybe you're sealed saved delivered sanctified but will you fight for your brother do you care enough about your brother and sister to say okay my land's all clear no more philistines tonight but oh my brother my let sister go to gethsemane for you let me go and be crushed that you can see christ in me that you can be encouraged that i can have some fruit to offer when you're hungry some shade when you're hot do you have that love of christ in your heart i believe we do i believe he's given that to us but don't let anything move you from that don't let little whispering words of discord and things like that try to to move you from that stay in that rest oppose anything that would keep you from that first love that first love if you remember when you're filled with the holy ghost and if you were really filled you didn't have all in your heart against anybody you didn't have one weight in that department yes you've been moved from that come back come back to that first love if you're heavier now than you were when you were filled with the holy ghost if you've picked up some things some baggage burdens are lifted at calvary when we come into church we can come to that altar every time it's open deacons won't charge you by the minute just come in and say lord i'm getting heavy again getting some things that are pushing me out of that rest i'm getting looking at myself again getting looking at my failures i'm not looking to to calvary like i first did oh he'll meet you at that altar he'll speak to you it's not about brother aaron figuring out what you need but if you'll come like that come and say lord speak to me if you can speak through a donkey and a rooster don't you believe you can speak to your son of god don't you believe he can speak to you we've got a labor to enter into this rest but it's worth it let our lives say thy kingdom come thy will be done not just our lips but let our lives be fully surrendered you know it's easy to look at the disciples and be like man you guys blew it the lord said for you to wait with him and you guys just slept and guess he should have gotten different disciples but just wait and look at pentecost but they got a second chance at this lord said you know watch with me here and they didn't but then he said tara ye in the city of jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high and they did it they waited they stayed together they got in one accord see we all want to go back to the pentecostal blessings but are we willing to humble ourselves to get in one accord are we willing to obey this scripture where it says when you come together to eat i believe that's here i believe that's what we're doing here we're feasting on the body word of the son of man it says when you come together to eat tarry one for another don't just come to church looking at yourself but come to the altar say lord my sister laurie tamlinson lord my my brother jeremy you know come come for one another carry one for another let's get in one accord let's get the love of god moving in our midst we're getting out of here i don't want to stay here i want to go to that supper i'm hungry for that i want to see my jesus he's doing the work we just have to rest in him it's like in ruth 3 and 18 if we can put that up ruth didn't rest just right away when she was in moab if she just rested there like orpha had her name would not be in the bible but she got to the right field she got to the right feet and then she found rest and her mother-in-law said sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day he that keepeth israel will not sleep we have one that's working to work in our lives where our movement's on the wrong track he can bring it right the things in our lives that are ugly the things that we can't handle he can make it all beautiful in his time just hold to his promises once ruth got to the right place right field the right feet sit down my daughter if we look at that scripture where it says it's the scripture let me find it here psalm 46 and 10. if we could put get that put up please it says be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth looked up what does that word be still mean it's one word in the original one of the ways it's translated is to fall limp to cease striving to become helpless to sink or to relax and just fall at his feet as if dead say lord i've committed it unto you i know you're able to keep that which i've committed it unto you what a rest it's worth it it's worth the striving it's worth the oil press the olive press also in that in that first scripture that we read in exodus it says the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace part of this rest is just to be quiet part of being still is just to be quiet that's the nature of our father for he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth that's the spirit that's in us not to complain or cause a fuss but let our words be life don't let us be that fountain that's trying to put out bitter water and sweet water but if you can't say something nice right his sheep know his voice and they're eating this book that they can prophesy again these lips in front of me i believe will speak the spoken word of god i believe they are let's watch what we're saying never let your confession be negative say good things to each other you can make it the lord can use you the lord is mindful of you lord cares for your loved ones speak good things speak those words that you know to be the words of your shepherd god has a purpose for your life to work the works of christ in you the greater works the same works that i do greater work so you do he wants to reach the lost with your hands and your feet and your love but to do that we've got to lose our own will in the in the sermon perfect strength by perfect weakness it's not that our weakness alone is adequate or perfect but as we can just surrender our weakness to god he can take that and he can turn it into perfect strength a lot of times we just say well i'm perfectly weak so let's uh let's carry on no it's not it's not trusting in your weakness it's not being arrogant in your inabilities but it's just surrendering it's going going and humbling ourselves and seeking him i thought of the quote it's from the church age book in the pergamum church age where says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith lord or they keep still we get excited about that first part but we kind of skip the second part or they keep still let's read ecclesiastes 5 and 2. it says be not rash with thy mouth let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before god for god is in heaven and now upon earth therefore let thy words be few preaching myself here i say a lot of stupid things but i believe this word will change me i believe he's going to help me to see the things that i need to let go of i believe that he's going to give me the strength to let go of those things the best form of rest the best form of stabilization is actually something that's moving that's what they've found is that if you just have something heavy well once it gets moving then it's probably going to stay moving because it has a lot of mass but to really keep something really stable and steady they use what's called gyroscopic stabilization if you've ever seen a gyroscope or or maybe you've ridden a bike and a bike is kind of a form of a gyroscope it's kind of like magic because it's this little top and as it's spinning on the inside it's rock solid on the outside it can bounce on anything balance on a string or a pencil they put them in sailboats so when the rough seas are going this gyroscope on the inside keeps the boat just always upright i thought isn't that like our rest that it's that life that's moving in us it's that holy spirit that's pulsating in his bride that just keeps us centered keeps us straight back to that cornerstone so let's keep moving let's keep still let's keep quiet let's keep believing first corinthians 15 and 58 if the musicians would come it says therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the lord it's always moving but always still for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord i believe he's moving in our midst i believe our lives are revealing him i had a man a jewish man and he paid us a compliment our family got to see our family just being our family and he said i saw your people have god i believe we do have him let's make him known let's be pleasing to him let's become one with him we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth but that only a happiness that real happiness it's not a party frivolity but it's a deep settled peace and a joy that comes to gethsemane the weeping may endure for the night that's part of it but joy comes in the morning that there's a scripture that says rise and shine there's a people that's gonna do that there's a people that'll shine like the sun because they've been to the same garden they've carried the same cross they've got the same life in them that original seed that can't compromise can't mix but everything else will fall away everything else will be burned up it's a question for you are you lighter today than you were yesterday [Music] are you laying aside every weight are you ready for that blast off [Music] he's here if you want to deal with something i'm not going to make an altar call i already did that but that angel that jacob wrestled with until he was blessed he's here if you need to wrestle tonight it's a good night to wrestle if you need the great physician to cut something out of your life that you haven't been able to let go of i'll do surgery on you [Music] what would you deal with tonight if the blast off was in the morning let's just spend a little bit of time in gethsemane and see if there's anywhere that our will has has popped up and these prayers that you're asking if you're saying well i've been begging the lord operate on me take this from me remember what he told paul he didn't tell paul no and paul beside him three times he didn't tell paul no because i believe when we see paul again that thing is going to be gone but he said my grace is sufficient for thee which i think means something like not quite yet paul but i'll carry you until the time so just hold on don't be discouraged don't let anything move you from that rest i believe it's almost morning i believe the angels of the lord are encamped about us [Music] maybe we're closer to that side than we realized that we're closer to seeing brother green again your parents again [Music] he knows every prayer they're all precious to him so don't give up on him he won't give up on you [Music] let's just trust him let's pray oh father you only give good gifts help us to receive this gift of your rest father oh god move in a mighty way break down every stronghold every fear lord every devil that's bound your children lord set us free lord let us leave here lighter than we were when we came in more in love with you lord more filled with your spirit lord we want to be leaking your spirit leaking your light that would be just such a pressure of an over overflowing fountain in our lives lord if we could make you known lord [Music] that we could be ready for that appointment we believe we have with you lord to meet you in the air forgive us the lord of our sins where we've disbelieved you lord help us to say i do [Music] lord every need here i don't know them but they're precious to you they administered every heart [Music] if we ask it in jesus name amen [Music] today [Music] when my life be glorified be glorified in my life lord be glorified today go in your church lord be glorified be glorified [Music] today in my home in [Music] my world [Music] [Laughter] [Music] glorified [Music] today and the more that i surrender my lord the more that i release my cares the more you take control the more that i can humble myself the more you lift me up every day i live lord i love you oh the more that i surrendered [Music] release my care more than i can humble myself the more you [Music] you know when we have a visiting minister we always ask him to stay and minister to the people and i just felt my heart does somebody need prayer tonight maybe you're struggling with something you just can't seem to let it go and god has used brother peter to speak maybe god can use brother peter to pray with you sometimes we just need some help i don't know i just just felt to to make that call to somebody and just say lord there are some things in my life i need to get past and have somebody minister for you under that same anointing so [Music] it's just just while he's being prayed for you pray for him also saying lord minister [Music] allow the brother to minister through prayer something that would give deliverance and help [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] the more that is [Music] the more that i remember [Music] the more you take control [Music] the more [Music] don't fret don't trouble yourself don't be anxious don't get to a point where you you so work yourself up trying to bring something to pass but let god be god let him be god he is more than able he can minister and do things in a way that we would never believe you would never put it that way he can take one and make a million out of it a whole lot easier or maybe as often we make a million into one when we make a mess out of it but god can take one into a million if we just cast our cares upon you if you'll stand with me you know and when somebody prays over you and you've asked stand on that believe it say god i've committed to you and i'm gonna rest in that rest is not laying around and doing nothing rest just giving it over to god you have you have a life to live you you have a testimony to be but there's peace in being that when you give it over to god you let him speak and let him work amen i thank the lord for the word of god today that reaches to our hearts and say hey i care for you i love you and and i thought that i said at first when he made that statement he said are you heavier than you were i said oh my he's going to get in trouble for that but no cast all your cares let all those things go aside and say lord you know here i am amen i've anchored my soul in the haven of rest what is it it's a place to rest after the ship has gone through the sea the battle is the place to come in and rest let's do the chorus there i've hankered my soul in the hat [Music] jesus i'm safe forevermore foreign [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] when you learn how to work with the equipment you work with whatever you do maybe in construction it's a hammer it's a but you let learn to let the tool do the work rather than you try to force it you know it works better i i found out that if if if you just let the tool work it's a lot less effort if you let god have his way and yield yourself and say wow that was a whole lot easier than i thought it was going to be because god's in charge there's rest in letting him do the work he'll put the words in your mouth he'll guide your way he'll direct your steps for that proper and that right ending so we've anchored our soul into having us lord we thank you for your word it's because you care for us to think that as he talked about the astronauts there was the the rocket and all that and the fuel and all that it there was equations and everything that had to be put together to achieve the proper launch to to to get into that proper rotation lord and everything had to be to an exact point lord how much more lord you met every condition everything that needed to be met you said it is finished lord help us to rest on that lord and trust in that today lord for that soon coming of our lord and savior that great meeting in the sky lord help us to believe that today we pray in jesus christ's name amen appreciate the lord today appreciate his goodness today amen lord willing we'll get together on sunday see what the lord has for us because he always has something for his children and i like that when you come to church and i know sometimes things get busy and you get you have to do something you come in at the last minute but if you get a chance to come in and rest your heart rest your soul get it get a spirit before the lord to get in a good attitude it sure helps the brothers that are song leading the musicians that are playing and set a wonderful atmosphere for the lord to minister and just the sweetness of his presence amen i believe him and i trust him because he keeps his word so amen as you go i've hankered my soul in the haven no the more [Music] oh peace be wonderful [Music] over my spirit forever [Music] far away in the depths of my spirit [Music] is [Music] wonderful [Music] over my [Music] of love what a treasure i have this wonderful [Music] yes peace [Music] over my spirit forever [Music] [Music] i am resting [Applause] [Music] in jesus [Music] foreign and his glory his flooding my soul [Music] sweet [Music] and last [Music] the verse we just sang previous to this i am resting this wonderful peace resting sweetly in jesus christ [Music] for
