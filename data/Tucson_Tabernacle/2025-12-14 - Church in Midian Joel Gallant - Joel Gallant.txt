To me, I was telling Brother Joel before we came out, I said, "That's our theme song." And it is. I think we're going to be singing that for eternity. I'm glad I got to learn it here on Earth. a few prayer requests. Brother Aaron Gar's mom, Sister Meline, she's not feeling well this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, she asked for prayer. Sister Hope Buckles is uh she's playing piano at another church this morning and she asked for prayer. She asked me about it and I said, "Sister Hope, be a blessing." Yes. And take a little love from here and take it to there on our behalf. &gt;&gt; Amen. So pray pray for sister hope, sister Margaret. Brother Joseph, there you are. Brother Joseph's mom's not feeling well. She flu like the flu, something like that. Pray for sister Margaret. Um, brother Glenn Tamlinson, Sister Martha's dad. Um, I didn't uh I think it's he was taken to the hospital this morning for high blood pressure, right? Pray for brother Glenn. Brother Glenn's a dear friend to all of us. Brother Heath Rickard called me this morning. My friend, he is having back problems. He won't he said he won't be in service this morning, but he asked that we would pray for his back. He'll be he said he'll be streaming in. And then my aunt Jacqueline Wheeler, she um was taken to the hospital yesterday with um some uh complications. Didn't know exactly what was wrong, but by the grace of God, the tests that she had last night came back. everything was good. So, she's um she's doing a lot better this morning. She's still in the hospital. Looking forward to her coming home. Brother Joe Miller writes uh from his wife, Sister Elizabeth, that she's going to the eye doctor um and with a plan on having surgery and uh she said that the medicine that she's taking is still causing her pain. And brother Joe also writes, "I talked to my uncle Stephen yesterday. He's 70 years old. He lost an apartment, everything, and even the cat, even his cats. He sleeps in a church in California, in Susanville, California. and uh he asked that we would pray that the Lord would provide for him for at least a hotel to stay in. And then sister Millia, she writes that uh she has a praise and it says this. She says, "Last week my car broke down at Fries and God sent me an angel to re to my rescue once again. He drove my car to the repair shop and left it in there and he got it fixed. um and uh took me took me back and the mechanic went and got me and brought me back within all within five hours and she had her car back and running. She said, "Thank you so much." [applause] You know, Sister Melia is a widow and she relies a lot on the Lord. probably as much or more than anyone else in this building. And it's sister Millia, it's a good place to be that you have to put so much trust in God. And he always provides, doesn't he? Amen. He does. Brothers and sisters, if you have a request on your heart, I I'd also like to um mention brother Steven Young, the uh the church that we are helping that our church is helping in South Africa. He [music] is having a tent revival this next week and he asked for our prayers. It's going to be two or three days that they're going to be ministering and trying to call sinners in Durban, South Africa. So if we could remember him and and friends, it's not just something that we do. If you have a request on your heart, you have something that you need from the Lord, make it known to him right now with an uplifted hand and say, "Lord, I need something. I could really use some help." He sees [music] those hands. Our father, you are wonderful, Lord. We thank you for your goodness and mercies to us. Lord, we thank you for Sister Amelia and how Father, you have always met her every need just like you have all of us. And we never want to neglect to say thank you. Thank you for what you did for her. And and Lord, we bring these requests before you, some very serious requests that you would make a way, Father, that they would just be placed at [music] your feet. Lord, that your healing hand or your miracle working hand would be upon each request. And Lord, that you would have your way and your will would be done. And with each uplifted hand, Lord, we place it into your into your hands that that it's it's much better if it's in your hands, Lord, and it's out of our hands. So, we give it to you, Father, and ask, Lord, that your will would be done in your time and in your way. And Lord, let us just be obedient servants, but we do trust in you, oh God, because you always come through. And Lord, bless the offering we pray. May it Lord be used in wise and productive ways to further your kingdom in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. I'll just uh I'll make a couple announcements. Um first, we have um I mentioned brother Steven Young and the work that he's doing in South Africa. He is going to be having a tent meeting and I I assume it's a result of our offering that we gave last month. So keep brother Steven in prayer and uh we will be as long as the Lord leads this way. We will be taking an offering once a month to be sent to Durban, South Africa for that ministry there. That will be next week that we'll take up that offering. So, next Sunday morning, the offering will go to the work that Brother Steven is doing there. And um just uh while I'm up here, usually it's one of the trustees or one of the deacons that that prays over the offering. The offerings that we have that that we take, these go to um they go to a number of things. They go to pay our visiting ministers. When we have um when we have somebody like brother Joel come in and bringing him here and paying for the expenses there. They go towards any special events that we might have. If we buy the the meat for a potluck or anything like that comes from our offerings. The tithing is different. The tithing will be used for the big expenses, the renovations for the church where um where the the bigger money has to go. That's where that's where the tithing that we take. And then an offering is something that you give out of your generosity above you above and beyond your tithing and that goes to these special projects and um even for things for the kids and that type of thing. So, the difference right there between the tithing and the offering. Um, next Sunday, I'm really excited. Next Sunday evening, I want to see I want to see you here, young lady. We're going to do what we're calling children's church. The kids right now, they're up in Sunday school. But, um, this is going to be dedicated to our young people. We're going to We need song specials. Brother Jordan is going to be leading in the worship. We uh I'm even trying to I'd like to get one of our young men boys to even maybe give us a little testimony or even preach a little five or 10 minute sermon. How fun, how nice would that be? Um so that's going to be next Sunday evening. It'd be a good one to invite your friends to any any young people that that you think would uh would enjoy it. And then next Sunday morning, we'll have our Christmas service. And then the following um Wednesday we'll have service because I believe that's Christmas. Um again looking forward to next Sunday evening on children's church and I'll teach a short lesson also on um over there and everybody come and enjoy. It's not just for the kids. We'll maybe have the kids sit in the front but they are so cute whatever they do. So, let's make sure that we we support him. That's uh that's next weekend. Visitors. Is this uh Cleo? Is this the young lady from Japan? &gt;&gt; China. &gt;&gt; China. &gt;&gt; Welcome, sister. God bless you. It's It's good to have you [applause] staying with the Salazar family. Welcome. She's embarrassed. How do you think I feel? [laughter] God bless you and any visitors that we have. You're welcome. Um we we appreciate having you here and uh you're a blessing to us. Um this morning we're going to sing a few more songs of worship before brother Joel takes the pulpit. But I just want to give my love and my appreciation to this young brother that's going to be ministering for us this morning. French his native language. He's from Quebec. And uh he and I met in I believe it was in we've probably met before, but uh the most striking time that that I remember him is in 2017. We had an outreach meeting in a small town called Cornwall. Um French speak uh it's just over the border, right? It's English. Yeah, it's bilingual there. And uh it was just a it was um outreach. There was this a brother had it on his heart to do a uh have a meeting in this little town and we went there and it was it was really it was a tremendous success and I was one of the speakers and afterwards brother Joel approached me and we had a short conversation. Sometimes the uh the multitude of words isn't necessarily the importance of a conversation. It's the quality of the words. And our conversation was so striking to me that I've never forgotten. He expressed his appreciation for lifting up our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And that was the start of a friendship that we've had until this time. I've spoken to his church. He's going to give a small report from his church if the Lord's willing when he speaks. But I just want to I just want to say that I have a lot of respect, a lot of admiration for brother Joel and a lot of confidence. So I hope that you have very very high expectations this morning because I do. Daniel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us stand this morning. We're going to Great is our God. &gt;&gt; The splend. [singing] Oh, [singing] clothe in mesty. Let all the earth rejoice. [music] Let all the earth rej. He wraps himself in light. The darkness [singing] tries to hide. It trembles at his voice. It trembles at his voice. And how [music] great [singing] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great [music] is our [singing] God? And all will [music] see how great how great [music] is our God. [music] and [singing] age to wait. He stayed [music] dead. In time [singing] is [music] beginning. [music] The Godhead [music] three in one [music] in five steer [music] God. Oh, [music] and sing with me. How great is [music] our [singing] God. And all will see how great and how great [music and singing] is our God. How great [music] and how great [music] is our God. Oh, and [music] sing with me. How great is [singing] our God and [music] all will see how great and how great [music] is our God. He's the name. [music] He's the name above [music] all. And he is he is worthy of all praise. And my heart will sing how great [music] is our God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; For he's the name above [music] all and he is he's worthy of all and [music] my heart will sing how great is our God [music] and [singing] how great is our God. Oh, sing [music] with me. How great is our God and all will see how [music] great how great is our God. Let's sing it again. Oh, how great [singing] is our God. &gt;&gt; Sing with me. How great is our God? [music] Don't see how great how great [music] is our God. You are great Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Good morning. &gt;&gt; May God bless you richly this morning. Amen. I think you may be seated for a minute. It's a a great honor for me to stand here and to be with you this morning as I hope you can cope with my friend English this morning. Um, yeah, you can see the accent here, but uh I pray God anoint I pray God will anoint the words coming out of my mouth into your heart this morning. &gt;&gt; Wherever you're at, whatever the condition you came to church this morning that something may be spoken that speaks directly to your heart and your condition. It's my prayer. And um as brother Dan mentioned, we've been friends uh for quite a few years now. and um and I truly admire his work and I I'm so honored to be here this morning and and have really a burn on my heart and and I hope that by the time of the the end of the service this morning, you will your heart will be stewed to a point where you will be interested in coming back tonight for part two. &gt;&gt; Tonight will be the clincher really. And uh it's uh with what we could call a miniseries. Uh it's two sermons that that goes together. So I hope we'll be together again tonight. And just a quick word about our church because um truly it's a miracle if I'm standing here with you this morning because this wasn't in my life goals or my dreams or my career plan to be a minister or a pastor as a matter of fact. Um, but you know when God hits you, it's like my life was going this way. So I I'm a businessman and and and my goal in life was to own a hundred businesses. That was my personal carrier plan. But I was, you know, going this way and then one day God hit me and changed the whole course of my life. I used to go this way and now I'm going this way. And it's like business uh and all these things they fade for me day by day and and the the desire to preach the gospel and to help God's people and to be a tool and help in the kingdom is growing day by day and u nobody would have thought this young boy would become a minister or pastor. It's truly the grace of God that I have found favor in the eyes of some people to trust me as their pastor really. And uh it's a true miracle. But uh we've planted a church um two years ago. It'll be two years December 31st actually. And um when we started there was 19 of us. So very small church plant. And God has blessed us um tremendously with uh now we have, you know, a storefront. We're out of the community hall. We we renovated a storefront. And when we signed the lease, it was a leap of faith. There was 35 of us and we signed a lease for a storefront that sits 100 people. And I told the brothers, we need to walk by faith. Oftentimes, we are the ones limiting God. Um, and so how can you send a 100 people if our church only sits 40? You know, and um, and so when I see empty seats in a church, I see a blessing in the making. &gt;&gt; There's there's a name on each and every one of these seats. God wants to send people to this church. And so we've rented a a church front, um, a storefront, a church building that sits a hundred. And it's been a year almost dayto day that we're in there. And uh we went from 35 to 65. 65. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God is sending new people, you know, by the day. And uh he's doing a great and mighty work. And um Amen. We should praise him for it. And I know there's a lot of new people in this church, too. Uh God is sending people. And uh you know the Bible says Jesus said his disciples, I will build my church. And so we have to get out of our heads that we we're building anything. We're merely tools. He said, I will build my church. And so when I see a church where no newcomers come, really what I see is a hospital with maybe no doctors or not ready to take sick patient. uh because God wants to send people but he will not send them somewhere where they cannot get helped and fed the gospel you know and so when you see people they start coming it's a miracle but God is the one sending these people and it shows your church is in the right atmosphere and condition to receive them and it's truly a blessing &gt;&gt; amen let's stand up and and turn to our Bibles in Exodus Chapter 3 and we'll start from verse one 1-6 and I'm not a long-winded preacher. So don't worry. You know, sometimes you have a visiting minister and you don't know when you'll be out for lunch, but not today. Now, Moses was sending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. And the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed. Then Moses said, "I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn." So when the Lord saw that, he turned aside to look, God called him from the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." Then he said, "Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet. For the place where you stand is holy ground." Moreover, he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. Let's pray. Father God, thank you for this opportunity you give us this morning to gather together in your presence and in your name. And I pray you be with us this morning and you would uh anoint the ears of our understanding so the words that will be spoken may have an effect and take root in our hearts so they could bear fruit. Lord, meet each one where they are this morning. I pray [snorts] meet them in their seat, in their condition, Lord, and and make a change in our lives this morning that we might go out of here seeing our hearts burned within us as we heard the word preached. It's my prayer. Take this meeting under your control. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. And so lately, God has started really revealing to me that, and it really blesses me, that the types of the Bible, they apply across the board. You see, we know everything in the Bible speaks of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything in the Bible speaks of Christ. &gt;&gt; Um, of Christ and his bride. Actually, it's a love story. It's a love book. It's a love letter. Uh but but the the types apply from top to bottom to from Christ to our personal lives. Yes, God has a great purpose for Christ and his bride. But there is the local church. There is the family. There is the individual. Every type in the Bible triggers down and applies to every level of our lives. Christ, bride, church, family, individual. And and you cannot read the Bible only at 20,000 feet. It will do you no good, &gt;&gt; right? It could be it could be about Christ and but but what about you? &gt;&gt; You need to see yourself in these Bible stories. &gt;&gt; You need to they're not just stories. They are living today. &gt;&gt; They're worth something today in our lives. And so uh today my title would be the church of Midian. The church of Midian. Now we uh we all know that Moses is a type of Christ. But as the types must also apply to the church, the family and and the individual. This morning we will type and tonight as well we will type the stories of of the children of Israel as they are in Egypt and getting out of Egypt to our personal lives. &gt;&gt; Our personal lives very um intimately. And the word of God is an infinite source of wisdom and and counsel and and light. And it discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. And this is what the word will do for us this morning. So I hope everybody brought a mirror with with him or her. Um because the easiest thing to do, you know, in a sermon is to say amen for brother so and so. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's easy. But to amen the word for yourself is different. &gt;&gt; It takes humility. And uh yes, and this morning I want to speak of an Exodus because we believe there are three exodus. And u the first Exodus is Moses bringing the people out of Egypt. And the second exodus is Christ taking the people out of the law and into grace. Out of Judaism into a new covenant of grace, &gt;&gt; out of the slavery of Judaism into liberty in Christ. &gt;&gt; And I'm afraid this second exodus is one many Christians have not walked. Many Christians have walked out of the things of the world, out of the first Egypt, but they have walked right off the right out of the world into law. And they're stuck there. They're stuck in the law. And Paul was one of them. You know what Paul would be? A true Christian is what we would call him today in most churches. A true Christian. very legalistic, very zealous in Judaism in law. But you know what? Paul had to leave the law to serve Christ. &gt;&gt; I didn't hear many. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He had to leave the law to serve Christ. &gt;&gt; How did Paul get out of Judaism? Is it fighting with Peter in a theological debate? Is it fighting with quotes? What did he do to get out of the law? He met God face to face. &gt;&gt; This is what happened to him. When he met God face to face, he walked that exodus &gt;&gt; out of the law and into grace. &gt;&gt; And and God is the same today, yesterday, and forever. And the Bible says with God there is no variation of shadow of turning. Uh so indeed the way it happened the first time is the way it will happen every time. You want to get out of the line in in grace you need to meet God face to face. So the first and second exodus really are are someone you know the children of God meeting God face to face. Moses met the pillar of fire that told him, "I am God." And it changed him. And Paul met the pillar of fire that said, "I am Jesus." And that changed him. &gt;&gt; And after Moses met with God, he could go back and take his people out of slavery, out of Egypt, God did it. He said, "I remembered my people." But he did it using someone who had met him face to face. &gt;&gt; And after Paul had met God face to face, he could go out go out there and take the people of God out of the slavery of the law and into grace. Now Christ did it. He died on the cross, but he had to use someone who met him face to face to take the people out of there. You with me? Moses, former Egyptian, Paul formerly in Judaism. But uh there is a third Exodus. And uh I want to speak a little bit about the Exodus this morning because I think we live in the days this Exodus is passed due for us. And and I'm afraid many of us haven't walked this Exodus yet. And this Exodus, we can read in our Bibles in Revelations chapter 18. I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sin and you received her plagues." This is one last exodus. And and if God is the same, we can study the past exodus to understand where we stand right now. And if we live in the days of an Exodus, we need to know what our Egypt is. And we need to know what our desert is. And we need to know what our promised land is. We need to know and and you know Abraham and I want to just speak one minute on Abraham because of tonight. You need to remember that Abraham is at the genesis of the first Exodus. He really is. Abraham didn't walk the Exodus but he is at the Genesis. But um he's the one who God made the promise to your people shall soldier in a strange land for 400 years. But I will bring them out. I will deliver them and bring them to my promised land. So Abraham is at is at the genesis of this Exodus because he's the one who received it and he's the one who got out of Babylon. God told him, "Go out of this city to a land I will show you." And in the second exodus, it's exactly the same thing because Malachi came about 400 year before the Christ and carried the promises and prophecies of the Messiah while the people were sinking or falling into Roman and Jewish slavery. And then they were without a prophet for 400 years, captives of Judaism and of the Roman Empire. I want you to to remember here this is a twin captivity. This is very important because because in the days of the second exodus you couldn't walk out of only one Egypt. You had to walk both exodus. &gt;&gt; There were two slaveries now. The slavery of the world, the Roman slavery and the slavery of the law. This is very important. And now I want you to realize that the reason they missed the Messiah is is not because they were not waiting for a Messiah, but it's because they wanted out on the Romans and not out on the law. what they were looking for. They were looking for a Messiah to take them out of the first slavery, the slavery of the world or the first Egypt. But what Christ was coming for was to take them out of the second slavery, the slavery of law. But they were fine with the law. They love their laws in Judaism. What they hated was the Roman captivity. You with me? &gt;&gt; And they missed the Messiah because they were fine with what God was trying to deliver them from. And we have to make sure we are not fine with what God wants us to walk out of or we will miss Christ again. Now I believe the turdic soda started when Luther slammed his thesis on the doors of Vatican. That's what I believe. I believe get out of her my people started in 1520 when Luther slammed his thesis on the doors of Vatican. But here's what I want us to realize this morning. There was a people that was the seed of Abraham that sojurned in Egypt for 400 years before their exodus and promised land. Now this is the first Exodus. The second is the same with Malachi. We've talked about it. And in the third exodus, I believe it's the same. As Luther is walking out of Babylon, the people stay in denominational slavery for 400 years. average. They stay in a church system and in denominations for 400 years. Even though there is an Abraham, there is someone who is at the genesis of this third Exodus, the people are still slave to the church system and organized religion because they love it. And this brings us to a big question this morning. What is our Egypt? What are we called out of? We are called out of three things. Not one, three. We are called out of the slavery of the things of the world. Yes, we know &gt;&gt; who's been walking that exodus. I have. &gt;&gt; I walked out of the slavery of the things of the world. &gt;&gt; But we are also called out of the slavery of the law. I won't ask I won't ask you to raise your hand, but I ask the question, have you walked out of the slavery of the law into grace? And the and the third Egypt, the one that pertains to our generation is we are called out of the slavery of the religious system. and and I think it just goes hand in hand with justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. This is this is so beautiful. Let me just stop here. Justification is the first exodus. It's when you it's when you are chosen, redeemed, taken out of the pit. It's when God said, "I remembered my people." And there is that one day when when you feel like God remembered you. He's he's chosen you. He's taken you out of the pit. He's justified you. He's freed you. He's redeemed you. [snorts] And he's taken you out of the things of the world. When we're justified, we receive a cleanup. We do. We receive a cleanup. Some pe someone would get baptized. A brother told me, "When I got baptized, the desire to drink alcohol left me right away. This is a miracle of justification, the cleanup. Your Egyptian slave master had to let you go when God redeemed you." &gt;&gt; But sanctification is the second exodus. And uh let me ask this this morning. Did the people or the children of Israel become sanctified when they left Egypt? Come on, let me ask you. Did the law sanctify the people of Israel? &gt;&gt; Did it? &gt;&gt; Did the law make them holy? If it didn't then, why would it now? &gt;&gt; Why do so many Christians think sanctification equals following the rules? &gt;&gt; It didn't work then. This Bible is proof about this thick in the Bible tells you you cannot follow the rules. &gt;&gt; You can't. It doesn't work. It doesn't work to the extent that God had to send his son to free us from the law, nailing it to a cross and and have us walk out of law into grace and new covenant. If we are the bride, we are called to walk out of the law and into grace. Sanctification is not a work of the law. It's a work of grace. The law is just a teacher. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. That's what the Bible tells me. Law is a teacher. It brought me to the realization that I couldn't make it and I needed Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause and cheering] Now if we are the church of Christ, we are also called out of church system and denominations. And and we need to know and understand clearly what our Egypt is. You see our Egypt is is Pentecostalism or denominationalism. We need to get out of religion. &gt;&gt; When I tell people I'm a Christian, they say, "Oh, what religion?" I tell them, "I hate religion." They're all puzzled. How can you be a Christian and hate religion? I do. What kind of Christian are you? I'm a Christian. Christian. By the way, we we label Christians not only with names of denominations, but with adjectives like a good Christian and a bad Christian. There's no such a thing as a good Christian. &gt;&gt; Christian means follower of Christ. &gt;&gt; You either follow him or you don't. [applause and cheering] Amen. As long as you live under the law, you cannot be sanctified. I don't know if someone got it. As long as you live under the law, you cannot be sanctified &gt;&gt; because sanctification is not a work of the law. It's a work of grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you have to meet God face to face and walk out of the law into grace &gt;&gt; into a personal relationship with Christ. &gt;&gt; It's a work of the Holy Ghost in you sanctification. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm getting away from my message. I I need to go back to [applause] I have a $100,000 or a million dollar question this morning. Where are you at personally? Are you in the promised land? Are you in Egypt? Are you in the desert? Where are you? Now, I have a serious reason to ask the question. Because how can you know you know what you're supposed to do next if you don't even know where you stand? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we can have buzzwords and say, "Oh, Exodus and different things, but where are you at? You're in Egypt. You're in the desert. Where are you?" See, since couple years, I see I notice a trend. It's like people are are looking for sensor sensationalism. It's it's like people are getting hyped about Pentecostals behaviors. I see some kind of movement or return back to Pentecostalism. I talked with many pastors and mainly across you know Canada and in Americas but and and there is a real movement of return towards you gifts miracles shouting speaking tongue and prophesying and casting out demons and people want sensationalism people want strong emotions they want trill they want excitement they want the message of divine healing and and I'm not saying these things are bad but a little over two years ago I myself left a very formal church to plant a church in a new area and uh but I found myself in a position or a state where I was searching for miracles. I wanted to see the spiritual gifts and miracles. I wanted to see the miracles of the days of William Brham for myself. Do you know where I found them? in the Pentecostal church. This is where I found them. Now, please remain seated and calm for just a few minutes. Give me at least 10 minutes before you drop the hammer. Uh, as I was on this quest for sensations and someone sent me a testimony from brother TL Osborne. You know him? He was an oldtime shouting Pentecostal and he was in brother Brandham's meeting and and and he tells that testimony where brother Brandham casted a spirit out of a person in simple words like Satan leave her alone in Jesus name. And then brother Brham said it's over she's free and Osborne said wait a minute we haven't even start to shout yet. Yeah, we haven't even worked been worked up yet. We How can the the demon be leaving already? We haven't started our, you know, our comedy yet. And that night, I realized listening to that testimony that God has had so much more in store for me than shouting and s sensationalism. and and and God had much more in store for me than the message of divine healing. &gt;&gt; And so I went to study the word because I wanted to understand why that desire was all of a sudden raising inside of me. You know, after so many years without that desire, why was that desire springing up inside of me? Would you like to know why? because I had just met God face to face. Amen. Because I had just met God face to face and it woke me up in my sleep and it put me into action. That's what draw me to to want to get in the action. And so let me ask you this question. Where did Moses meet God face to face? Where did he Where did Moses meet God face to face? I don't think it's working. Okay. In the church of Midian. That's where he did. Remember this morning we have to see ourselves as individual in in the types of the Bible. You see Moses just like me and I assume like most of us was raised by a Christian mother, a godly mother. and she taught him about the promises of God and she told him who he was and that God had a plan for his life and that God was real. But he also received an indication in Egypt. And Moses like us, he had a call upon his life. He had a part to play in God's economy, but he also had a hurtly calling. The world wanted wanted to make him a king. Egypt offered him pleasures and wealth and so forth. And Moses was living a double life. He was a double agent. Yeah. When he was with the Egyptians, he was a future king, but when he was with his people and his mom, he was a Christian. &gt;&gt; And he relied on the promises and and the stories of the Bible and so forth. and and he was living this double life until he was caught and confronted with his life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that day, the day one of his brothers told him, "Will you kill us like you killed that Egyptian?" That day he ran from Egypt. We could almost say that it is the first Exodus. Moses leaving Egypt for the first time. &gt;&gt; So Moses leaves Egypt. He runs from Egypt. Do you know where he's going? He runs from this worldly life. He runs from the people wanting to make him a king and hovering pleasure and wealth and stuff. Do you know where he runs? He runs to church. Moses let go of his double life. He takes charge of his life and he finds a local church in Midian. He even married the pastor's daughter. Moses starts a family in Midian. He gets a stable job in the family business. He goes to church every Sunday. He doesn't live a double life or a worldly life in the palaces of Egypt no more. No. Moses is now a good Christian. He's a good man. He's a good husband and he's a good father. and he goes to church every Sunday. Praise God. He's even the son-in-law, the pastor of the church of median. There's only one problem. Moses ran away from his calling into a religion. There's just one problem. Moses is the only one of his people who lives the good life. Everybody is left behind suffering. &gt;&gt; While he's living the good life in the church of Midian, his people are still slave in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Now Moses is not living in Exodus. Moses is in exile. Now I'm not the one saying it. He is. He named his son Gersam, which means in exile in a strange land. He named his own son after his condition. 40 years in the church of Midian, living the Christian life away from God's calling upon his life. Every single one of his family members and people is backslid and slave in Egypt. But that doesn't bother him. He lives his little Christian life. I don't speak about Moses now. I speak about the modern Christian running from Egypt in the church of Median. Not living the double life anymore. Not living in worldly sin anymore, but running from his calling and settling in a little church, thinking living the good life is good enough. I'm afraid most believers built a life in a little church in Midian, living a quiet and religious life far from the plan God has for their life. Yet they left the life of sin in Egypt, but they left behind their family, their belongings, and every privilege that belonged to them. 40 years. 40 years Moses spent in the church of many doing, sleep, work, repeat, taking care of his wife and taking care of the sheep of his father. He was even co-pastor. He helped with the sheep. 40 years running from his calling, running to a church in Midian while everybody is suffering back in Egypt. You know why? Moses had never met God face to face yet. Now, mentally, intellectually, he knew who he was. Mama had done tell him. Mama had done a good job. He knew who he was, but he had never met God face to face. Oh, but when he met God, God gave life to his commission. God gave him courage. God gave him power to get the job done. Miracles, sensationalism, supernatural. Now, he had a thirst for miracle because he met God face to face. And there he goes back to Egypt to take over. Before the Exodus, there has to be an invasion. Come on, church. Before the Exodus, there has to be an invasion. And once someone's met God face to face, it can be a one-man invasion. It doesn't care. Contrary to all common sense or logic, it doesn't care. Why? Because he wasn't called to exile, but he was called to an exodus. And exodus means we leave nobody behind. We bring everybody with us. Exodus means we leave nothing behind. We bring all that belongs to us and everything belonging to Egypt as well. [applause] But oh, how many Christians have adopted the exile mentality running from the world into a local church in Median. They become Christians and they cut themselves from everybody. They close themselves from the outside world and become self-centered living a life without privileges. A miserable Christian life waiting for heaven. How many times you meet Christians? You say, "How are you, brother?" By the grace of God, I'm good. Yes, I met Christians that long for death to go to heaven. Come on. The kingdom of God is now. &gt;&gt; There was a brother once I went to coffee with him at Tim Hortons. You guys don't have Tim Hortons. You don't know what you're missing. It's my second office. It's amazing. You need to try it sometimes. I go to Tim Hortons with him. I get there maybe five minutes after him. He's sitting at a table with his coffee. So I I I go to him and I say, "How are you, brother?" He says, "Oh, [sighs] it's by the grace of God that there's still a breath in and these lungs." And I'm like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait. You see that girl, the casher at Tim Hortons? It's also by the grace of God if she has a breath in her lung, but she doesn't even know it and she's happier than you. She's smiling. &gt;&gt; If you fit the description this morning of the helpless Christian waiting to die to go to heaven and finally be happy. Let me tell you this with love. You haven't met God face to face yet. &gt;&gt; It'll change everything when you do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when you meet God, you receive power and you receive your commission. &gt;&gt; And it's it's no more about seeing someone with great gifts of miracle. It's about you yourself walking in the path that God has for you and redeeming your own people. &gt;&gt; It's not about the show and sensationalism anymore. It's about invasion and possession. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, we all know this, but I hope it makes more sense today. He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned, and these signs shall follow those who believe." Now this verse tells us how we know if we believed because it uses the word follow and that indicates that if you believe you will start walking because if I want to follow you you have to be going somewhere. If you sit in your rocking chair and wait for a rapture, you do not believe. &gt;&gt; And no wonder no signs are following you because you are not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; These signs will follow those who believe in my name. They will cast out demons. They will speak with new thongs. They will take up serpents. And if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick and they will recover. This is not for somebody else. This is for the believer who met God. &gt;&gt; This is his possession, his work tool for invasion to make sure nobody stays behind. &gt;&gt; But that's not what modern Christian want. They don't want the power for themselves. What they want, they want the pastor to invite someone with a great gift or someone who can put on a show in the church, miracles and and power and evangelism and and they want church, what they call it. They want church. Christians today, they want to see the miracles of Jonathan Jumbris. Now, get me right. I'm not saying that if someone performs a miracle or casts a demon, he is Janice or Jeus. I could have said they want to see the miracles of Moses. The idea here is that people want the trill. They want to see a gift in action. And the fact they want to see a gift in action, it proves they don't possess the power themselves. Now, I want to make a strong statement this morning, if any. In Egypt, the people were intrigued and amazed at the miracles performed by Moses, right? And they all died in the wilderness. And Moses died, too, by the way. I hope that sinks in right now. And this brings us to our climax for for this morning's service. The miracles and signs are for Egypt. They still have a role to play because these types are now spiritual. And and and we need to invade Egypt to take our loved ones out of there. And and when we do, when we start walking by faith, a one-man invasion, these signs will follow. They will they are for Egypt. But once out of Egypt, we are called to something quite different. We are called to a promised land. And you know what our promised land is? Christ. Christ is my promised land. &gt;&gt; And once I'm pregnantated with the word and once I I am truly married to Christ, then I have this promise. Speak the word and I'll bring it to pass. And when we are focused and amazed by the signs and wonders, and when we are looking for them, it proves we are in Egypt still. But we are called to an exodus towards a promised land out of Pentecostalism and sensationalism and and into the kingdom. God promised us into Christ himself with the power ourselves not for the show but for the work of the kingdom. Not for the show. Not for the great ministry. Not not to travel on a private jet and and own a mansion, but for the work of the kingdom such as I have I give to you. Stand up and walk. Not for the show, for the work of the kingdom. Church, every one of us this morning has a calling on his life. We have a part to play in God's great economy. And that part is not to sit on a pew. God has something he wants you to do. There are works that he prepares beforehand so that ye will walk in them. Every pray, every place that the soul of your foot will tread upon, I have given you. You possess it. Walk by faith and possess the land. That's what God told to Moses. Moses received that promise, but he couldn't fulfill it. There was no need for healing in the promised land. There was not even a hospital or a nurse because nobody was getting sick or hurt even in battle. Nothing could harm them. And when you are in Christ, nothing can harm you. And we are called to cross over Jordan into the promised land. We are called, church, whatever you are doing, stop right now and get into Christ if you haven't. He is our promised land. Not get into church. Not not get into church. No. Get out of organized religion. Yes. Find a church. Find a church that does not summit to any church system and fellowship there. And I believe you have found one. By the way, this is why I'm honored to be here. I believe you have found a church that does not submit to a church system. Go to that church and fellowship there, but make sure you get into Christ. E is the promised land. [applause] Let's go back to that little church in Midian. What about it? you know, this little church and his people, this formal church where you could have your religion quietly. This is what it was. You run there to median and uh it's in the back side of the desert. It's not the promised land. It's the desert. It's a church in the desert. and you can live a quiet religious Christianish life and raise a family, you know, and and run your business. And but what happened to this church? Because we see this church later on in the actual Exodus. God speaks to Moses in Numbers 31 and says, "Take vengeance on the Medidianites for the children of Israel. Afterward, you shall be gathered to your people." So Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm some of yourselves for war, and let them go against the Medidianite to take vengeance for the Lord on Medidian." Now this little median church was still causing problems. Even though Moses was out of it and even though he had invade Egypt and he had started the Exodus, this church was still trying to entice the children of Israel. And and for that reason, God told Moses, arm your people and go there and kill it. Don't tolerate it. Don't say, "Oh, it's fine. We love them. Kill it. It goes after the children of God." And so the people went to do the job, but didn't kill everybody. Didn't obey. Didn't kill everybody. And Moses said to them, "Have you kept all the woman alive?" Now in the Bible, the woman typifies a church. We know that. Have you kept all the woman alive? Look, this woman caused the children of Israel through the council of Bethlehem to trespass against the Lord in the incident of Peor. And there was a plague amongst the congregation of the Lord. A woman is a church and the church of Midian under a false influence seduced the children of God and caused them to trespass against the Lord. Even after they really got out of Egypt in exod in an exodus, Moses wasn't done yet dealing with the church in Midian. She was still the church. She was still opposing God's work and causing trouble as she was a tool in Satan's hand to hinder the children of God from getting to the promised land. Now, I want you to to understand that this is very important. God's purpose for your life is to reach your promised land, marry with him, and get into him. But that formal church or that church systems goal, it's a tool. It offers you substitution. Religion for relation. Religion for relationship. And it's trying to mess with the children of God and have stop before the promised land telling them, "You've made it. Welcome to church. Here's an image of Christ we've painted for you. worship that image, you'll be fine. God doesn't want you to worship an image. He wants a relationship with you. &gt;&gt; He wants you to worship his person. &gt;&gt; She was still causing trouble and opposing God's work. But still, God told the people, "Kill it." But the people spared her one more time. Oh, we cannot say anything against it. We have to respect the church. Be careful what you say, brother, when you speak against it. She caused the children of God to be infidel. Are there sons and daughters of God in the church of Midian? Yes. Moses was there for 40 years. But everybody that sits in the church of Midian this morning needs to meet God face to face. &gt;&gt; Are there sons and daughters of God in Egypt? Yes. They need an Exodus. They need you to invade Egypt &gt;&gt; and go pick them up and get it get them out of there. And I want to ask you again personally as we close this morning to you to you personally where are you? Are you in an exodus or are you in exile? Are you in median this morning playing church? Are you in Egypt? Are you in the desert? Are you in the promised land? Are you with the ones on the side of the Jordan and the ones in favor of a return in Egypt? Do you miss the miracles of Egypt? Sensationalism and the big gifts. Do you miss it? Isn't the word enough? Isn't Christ enough? You have to take account of where you are this morning and what needs to be done to bring you to the promised land if you're not. Now, let me summarize. Not what should be, but what most likely is our Christian walk because we're human human beings. It should be Egypt, Exodus, promised land. But here's how it looks. It looks more like this. Egypt, exile, invasion, Exodus, desert, promised land. I believe this is truer to our actual walk. This is what Moses did despised despite being raised by a Christian mother who told him everything he needed to know. This is still what Moses did. And this is what most Christian do. Brother, if you're in exile this morning, I don't condemn you. Moses was there for 40 years. And and and God didn't despise him for that. God didn't rebuke him for that. But God came and met him face to face and gave him his commission, purpose, and power and courage to go and fulfill what he was on earth for. And so I could say this, why are you on earth for why is it? If you don't know, maybe you haven't met God face to face yet. Lord willing, tonight we will speak more about the children of Israel and relate to their journey in our lives. This morning was about Moses. Tonight will be about the people and I hope you be there brothers and sisters. The musicians could come. It will be challenging tonight but it will be a blessing. You know we need Christians we need to challenge the status quo. There's nothing as a status quo for a Christian. We either move forward or we start backsliding. It's either or. A true Christian wants to know the plan of God for his life. There is a huge difference, brothers and sisters, between a Christian and a religious person. It's night and day. It's so different. A religious person is happy with the current state of his life and finds comfort in his doctrine and in his legalistic life. But a Christian finds comfort in Christ and wants to grow and know God's plan for his life and know how he can impact the kingdom. &gt;&gt; You are called to service church to play a part in God's economy. God needs you. This church needs you. Not sitting on the pews, but putting the shoulder to the wheel. A Christian finds comfort in Christ, not in rules, not in law, not in dogmas, not in creeds, but in Christ. and wants to grow and know God's plan for his life and how he can impact the kingdom. It's time to leave our little church in Midian and go back to Egypt and take over and take what belongs to us and bring our loved ones with us and our belongings and bring what's what belongs to Egypt as well. You know when when the children of Israel left Egypt, the Egyptians were so done with them that they were giving them riches. Take everything but just leave. &gt;&gt; But I don't see that today. It's quite the opposite. We tend to leave everything in Egypt and run away, escape by ourselves. and think we are Christian because we settled in a little church in the backside of the desert. It's time to meet God face to face and to receive power and a commission [music] and a purpose and to realize the kingdom of God is now. [snorts] You know when Jesus was baptized, he instantly started to preach and to say the kingdom of God is near or is at hand. And when we hear that, we think it's because it's soon. There's something inside of us that hears the kingdom of God is near and we think, "Oh, the rapture is soon." But guess what? When he sent his disciples two by two, he told them, "When you get to a city, tell them the kingdom of God has come near." What he was saying was, "When I came close to you, the kingdom of God came near. I am the kingdom of God. This what Jesus was saying. But then when he commissioned his disciples, he told his disciples, when you go to a city, tell them as we have come in this city, the kingdom of God has drawn near to this city. And he who rejects you rejects me. He said, "The kingdom of God is here and now it's time to stop waiting and stop acting upon it." Let's pray. God, Father, we bow before you this morning. as your word was preached and discern our hearts intents and thoughts. Lord, each one of us is in a different state and in a different place this morning because it is a spiritual condition we are talking about. But God, you are merciful God and you love us and you are ready to meet us where we are. Even if we run away in the backside of the desert, you're still faithful to come and meet us where we are to give us commission and purpose and power. And I pray you do it this morning for someone, someone who is humble enough to look at himself in the mirror and say, "Oh, I'm not where I should be. I've settled in a little church, but I am not walking in any works you have prepared for me, Lord. I'm just waiting, but I want to be done waiting. I want to meet you face to face, and I want to be a tool for this kingdom. Lord, this morning I realize my people is suffering and I'm on the only one sitting in church and feeling blessed and but everybody else is a slave in Egypt. [snorts] Give me power. [music] Give me courage. come and meet me this morning where I am so I can go out of this building and start a one-man invasion, a onewoman invasion and go after my loved ones and go after what is mine and work for the kingdom. Lord grant it. Grant someone this morning with your presence, touchable, physical. Your presence face to face. Something that will change a life now and forever. [music] Jesus, make a way. I pray, have your way. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing. We're maker. You are here. You're moving in our midst. I worship you. I worship you. You are here. You're working in [music] this place.

No matter where you find yourself, in the desert, in Egypt, in Median, come to him. Come to him and ask him for a facetoface meeting this morning. And he will he will touch your heart and he [music] will make a way for you because he is a way maker and he is working even when we don't see it. And then sing that.

You never [music] stop working. You never stop. [singing] You never stop working. Even [music] when I don't see it, you're working. Even when I don't feel it, you're working. You never stop. You never stop [singing] working. You never stop. You never [music] stop working. Way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. My [music] God, that is who you are you are. You are [music] way maker, miracle worker, promise [music] keeper, light in the darkness. My God, that is who you are. And I met Brother Joel in that town. And after I spoke, Brother Joel came to me and he said, "I saw what you were trying to do." And I had just got done preaching about miracles and great things that had happened. And I said, "But God is a God of today. He's not a God of 50, 60, 100, 2,000 years ago. He's a God of today." And I say the same that he said to me back in 2017. I say the same to him. I saw what you were trying to do. We came out of Egypt as Moses did &gt;&gt; and he went to the priest of Midian, married his daughter Zapora, went to church there, but he met God there. &gt;&gt; And what did he do? He didn't stay out of Egypt. HE WENT BACK TO EGYPT and said, "Now, I'm going to get my loved ones. I'm going to get my friends. I'm going to get my family. AND I'M GOING TO BRING HIM OUT WITH A MIGHTY HAND. That's what Moses did. I saw what you were trying to do, my friend. Brothers and sisters, we have come out. We're not sinners this morning. We're not We're not people that are struggling so much with sin in our lives. We come out of that. But let's not stay in Midian. Let's not stay in that church. &gt;&gt; We have friends. We have loved ones. If we truly believe that this is the end of days, if we truly believe that this is the end times, LET'S GO GET THEM. &gt;&gt; Let's go right back and let's get them and bring them out. &gt;&gt; Do you see what our brother was trying to say? &gt;&gt; Beautiful. And God is a way maker. I love it when he said and I saw the eyebrows raised when he started talking about miracles and this and everybody thought, "What is he trying to say? We're not supposed to have miracles." What did they think when Jesus said, "A wicked and adultery adulterous generation seeks after a sign." &gt;&gt; And yet here is the sign giver. Here is the great physician that is standing there healing all their diseases. And he said, "Now you're seeking after a sign." What they should have been doing is seeking for divine healing. But don't forget the divine part. Seek after God and then he provides. Are you with me, friends? Take this service this morning. [music] Take it to heart. Think about what our friend said. I know what he was trying to say. He was trying to say, "You've come out of that. Now meet God and go right back into it. Let's all stand. What did Jude say? I believe it was Jude. He said, "You have got to put your hand into the fire to yank them out, our loved ones. We've come out of Egypt, friends. We've come out of it. We've changed our lives. We're no longer sinners. Now, let's meet God and let's go right back and let's pull everyone out. Amen. And follow the way maker. Let's continue on with a song. &gt;&gt; You are way maker, miracle worker, promise keep in the darkness. My God, that is [singing] who you are. And you are. You are way maker, [music and singing] miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. My God, that is who you are. And that [singing] is who you are. And that is who you are. And that is who you are. Oh, that is who you are. That is who you are. That [singing and music] is who you are. That is who you are. Oh, that [singing and music] is who you are. And you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. And you are way [music and singing] maker, miracle worker, promiseke keeper, light in the darkness. [singing and music] My God, that is who you are. [music] And you are [singing] way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. [singing and music] My God, that is who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, please take this morning, take what our brother said and just digest it and think about it. Come back tonight and let's hear the second part of this. We're so few this morning. I I wish we're missing so many people. I wish that we had everyone here to hear this. It inspired me so much that I wish I had an hour to preach about it. Just tremendous. We came out of brother John. We came out of sin and we came out of Egypt. We went in to this to this place and it's been good and and and we haven't sinned there. But God wants to send us back. He wants us to meet God. He wants to fill us with his Holy Spirit. Then he wants to send us back to get our loved ones. Moses's family was still there. You know, his sister was there. His brother was there. All of his friends were there. God sent him back and pulled him out and used him in a mighty way. And all of us, every one of us, brother Paul, every one of us, we have that same commission. Jesus himself said it. He goes, he says, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel." He said, "Heal the sick, cast out devils, do these mighty things, bring them out, make disciples of all nations." Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord God, Lord, I I'm challenged. I'm convicted this morning. And Father, I'm grateful. Thank you for sending your servant, Brother Joel, to us this morning. Father, it spoke to my heart, Lord. I I've come out of these sins, and Lord, let me not be comfortable now in this church of Midian, but Father, let me see you face to face as the word teaches us. And Lord, may your spirit then guide us back to call these out that need to be called out. Father, use us. Lord, each person in this building. Lord, Moses was 80 years old when you called him and you brought him out of Midian and brought him back to Egypt. So, Father, none of us are too old. None of us are too young. But Lord, let us report for duty as Isaiah said, "Lord, send me." I pray that all of us, Father, would be ready. And Abel, and Lord, show yourself to us. And Father, let us invade the enemy's land. Let us go and let us take down Egypt, Father. And we'll do it, Lord, not by our own might, but by a mighty God that's with us. A miracle working God, a healing God, a God that can part the Red Sea. Lord, go before us. We pray. And Father, commission us that we might go back and pull our loved ones out as Moses did. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Friends, take it seriously. He's commissioned each one of us. You say, "Well, I'm too old." Well, Moses could have said he was too old. He was 80. No, we're not too old. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's get to work. There's There's work to be done. You with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Give myself away. I give myself [singing] away so you can use me. I give myself away. Oh, I give myself [singing] away so [music] you can use me. And here [music] I am. And here I stand. Lord, my [singing] life is in your hands. And Lord, I long to see your [music and singing] desires revealed in me. And [music] I give [singing] myself away. [music] Oh, I give myself away. [singing] So you Who can [music] use me? I give myself [singing] away. Oh, I give myself away [music] so you can use me. Take [music and singing] my heart. Take my life [singing] as a [music] livinging sacriice in all [singing] my dreams in [music] all my plans. Lord, I place them in your [music] hands and I give myself [singing] away. Oh, [music] I give myself [singing] away so you can use me. I give myself [music and singing] away. I give [music and singing] myself away. Amen. Amen. You're commissioned now. Every person in this building, you're commissioned to go. First, you got to meet God and then go and go in the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. You can guarantee that God will be with you, but you got to go. Moses had to g up his loins and and [music] start heading to Egypt. Picked up his stick and he went. So, let's go, friends. Amen. Brother Lionel, let's do it, man. Let's get this job done. Let's finish the work. Let's get it. Let's Let's get them in. God bless you, friends. Come tonight. Hear part two. We heard a good sermon this morning. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It was good. Let's hear part two tonight. God bless you. You're dismissed. Life is not my [singing] to you I belong. [music] Oh I give [singing] myself I give myself to you. My life [singing] is not my [music] own. To you I belong. Oh, I give [music] myself I give myself to you. I give [music] myself [singing] away. Oh, I give myself [music and singing] away so you can use me. I give myself [singing] away. [music] Oh, I give [singing] myself away so you can [music] use me. Give myself away. I give myself [singing] away so you can
