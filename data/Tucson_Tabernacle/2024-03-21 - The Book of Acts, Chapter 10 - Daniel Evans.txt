I must open the Bible and fell on this and begin to read the disciples actions when they saw somebody who wasn't in their group and they had told him he said we saw a man casting out in our spirits and he goes but he wasn't with our group and then but Jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part said for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ fairly I say unto you he shall not lose his reward and reading there about Peter when he has that Vision he said oh I would never touch anything unclean and the Lord tells them don't call unclean what I have cleaned so I just trust you know and sometimes we look at somebody or someone's kind of Judge it that way but by the grace of God I'm not in that place today and I just appreciate uh leaning on the Everlasting Arms what a fellowship what a joy Divine leading on the Everlasting [Music] please Everlasting [Music] [Music] secure from all along [Music] hey [Music] from all [Music] living on the Everlasting [Music] with my Lord the Everlasting me from home [Music] back into from all alone [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man just just resting there saying Lord I committed to you I get that doesn't mean you don't do anything you're just trusting on him live a life that would please him and it would be a testimony to someone else always a good thing amen Jesus Paid It all in it like to do the verses with with that song also [Music] Jesus all to him [Music] [Applause] [Music] he washed and wine thy strength and lead us all the bigness watch and pray ing Finding Me thy knowing Jesus [Music] sin had left did I find thy powers [Music] nothing could ever [Music] whereby thy Grace today [Applause] [Music] Jesus made it home sin had left the crimson's day [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus died my soldiers [Music] thank you then had left a crimson's name just the voices Jesus Paid It All all to him had left a crimson sting [Music] one more time with the music [Music] amen as our brother did Daniel prepares here God still moves if we'll stand how many know that God is still the same yesterday today [Music] he does not say ing foreign [Music] Lord Jesus we're thankful that we can count on you that you'll still move when we have a need Lord we pray that you be with us tonight and Lord as I open up this book of Acts I want to pray that you give me wisdom Lord that your spirit you welcome here and father as we learn from the successes and the failures of these Great Men of old father we pray that we can take our lives and place them into this book and learn from what's been said and father apply it to every day most of all Lord puts you first Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you all you can be seated foreign that scripture brother Aaron read I want to read it again um he was Mark is Mark 9. Mark 9 39 but Jordan could you put that back up it says this it says but Jesus said forbid him let's let's go back to 9 38. and John answered him saying Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followed not us and we forbade him because he followed not us so there there's somebody casting out devils and they said hey you're not with us so you got to stop doing that but Jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part now listen to this for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward the um in my Bible the note above that section I just read is called the the rebuke of sectarianism and that's something that that's so prevalent in the New Testament and it's so prevalent in the book of Acts says it's good to have you back God bless you it's it's it's prevalent in the book of Acts and it's it's prevalent with us even today and it's something that we always got to watch out for and in my lesson tonight that is going to be the the main the main part of it but first I want to give a little review of Acts chapter nine we had we had this man Saul of Tarsus and you remember what happened he received his conversion mightily he got knocked down on the ground and this light blinded him and and then he was prayed for it he was healed and just a a tremendous testimony but then we see and if I remember right the words were and after many days and we see we look at in another place in the Bible another place in Paul's writings it said that he went down to Arabia for three years and he went down I believe he went down to make sure that this experience that he had he went down to make sure that he was right because we can have an experience and it might not be from God and I talked about I mentioned the Mormons and how the Mormons will tell you to pray about what they say and to pray about this Book of Mormon and that you'll receive this uh I believe it's called a burning in the bosom but you'll receive this this um experience and then once you receive that experience all of a sudden you believe Joseph Smith and you believe the Book of Mormon and as I said before millions of people have had that experience so how could they have that experience and it be against God's word and it's odd because after I ministered on that it may have just been my mind I had a bad dream on and when whenever I preached it um I had a bad dream and a dream that I said what I just said and I dreamed that there was a bunch of Mormons in the audience and and as I was leaving they were they were saying can you believe what that guy said and the disrespect that he had and and I said well they don't recognize me as the guy that was in the Pulpit saying it so I went back and I I talked to him and and they were like well that was disrespectful and I said no brother I said it wasn't disrespectful I said it was the word and and you're off the word in doing this and and I wasn't trying to offend you and I felt so bad in my dream I was just feeling like so condemned like I hurt somebody but I told him I said but your doctrines are wrong and I held up my Bible and I patted it like I do I said because it's off of this book and then I woke up you know I'm not saying it was a spiritual dream or I may have been worried about what I what I said because as I've as I mentioned before one of my best friends growing up was a Mormon guy and he was just the salt of the earth if he asked me just one of the finest people you ever meet and I was thinking on that during the week and and a testimony that happened to me that I wanted to share with I wanted to share it last week but I didn't feel right about it but I feel good about telling it tonight I was in Cambodia we were doing the work of the Lord there and Cambodia is the largest Buddhist country in the world it's it's almost it's like 99 or 97 something like that Buddhist really really strong in that faith and the Buddhism faith is uh it's something that the people many Buddhists are very very dedicated as with Muslims or any any real Faith but they really get into their faith and and they really get dedicated and they really start worshiping in a way and they have just thousands of Gods that they worship and they'll be different ones and we were when we were there we saw this this man that was laying in front of this altar of this Buddha for just hours and hours came back later on he was still laying there and he had given some bananas as an offering to this the statue it's funny how those never disappeared the priests come and take them and put them in the offering and do whatever they do but when I was there I walked into the hotel where we were a very nice hotel in um uh I forgot the name of the the city I think it's Phnom Penh is the city where you're at and and I walked into the hotel and we were checking in and just a beautiful place and in the center of the room it was probably a room about this size um in the center of the room there was a a Giant Buddha statue that man it may have reached the ceiling here it was giant maybe not quite that tall but just huge and I was looking at it and I was really admiring the uh the way that they had built it and the goal it was gold and it was just this beautiful um statue and I was looking and I was just trying to figure out how they built the thing and I looked up and this may sound strange but it happened something spoke to me and I got this really good feeling like really happy feeling and something spoke that thing spoke and it said look at me it said look how big I am I was like and I was looking at it and then it said and like I said I got this real happy feeling inside and it said it may sound strange but this is what it said it said don't you want to be my friend and then I came to myself I was like whoa that was real I didn't just imagine that there was a communication between me and something else that it it it was an experience that I had can you imagine if I would not have been anchored in this gospel or if if uh if someone is is converting to Mormonism if they're not anchored in this and they don't have that experience that same experience that that Saul of Tarsus went and spent three years studying imagine if I wouldn't have had that experience it was real it was a real communication because between something and me and I can't explain what it was so in saying that I wanted to bring back to your remembrance what Saul of Tarsus did he went away to pray about this experience that he had that experience whenever we have an experience we always need to make sure that this experience lines up with the gospel that it lines up with with the word of God and most of all that it lines up and it's all the same that it lines up with Christ check it with Christ and you'll see that sometimes an experience we have to be careful because it might lift us up and we might get an answer say say like for me if uh maybe I'm I'm praying about preaching the gospel or something and and I really really want something I'm gonna get what I want I'm going to have some experience I'm going to see something I'm going to have some sort of a of of a supernatural experience that it's going to give me what I want rather than me seeking the Lord and seeking what he wants that's what happened with Saul of Tarsus he went away and he sought the Lord to make sure that that Supernatural experience that he had was according to the word you see what I'm saying always be careful of experiences but I'm going to read in Acts chapter 10. about experiences that came from God don't we don't ever want to we want to be careful but then we don't want to put out something that God does so let's go to Acts chapter 10. verse 1. there was a certain man in caesarea called Cornelius a centurion of the band called The Italian band now this place caesarea it's a city that's named after Caesar Augustus there's a couple of them there's there's a at least two of these cities that that were named after this great man Caesar Augustus and basically it was the one who built the city and he would he named it after Caesar so that's where C that's where caesarea comes from the name and it says this that he was a centurion of the band called The Italian band now the Roman army had had what's called Legions and these Legions were between five and six thousand soldiers or six thousand men these Legions were compromised of what's called a cohort or in this case it's called a band and in those bands or those core cohorts were about 480 soldiers so they were about a little less than 500 men so in these bands these cohorts there's groups of 100 people and or 100 soldiers those 100 soldiers are what was was led by what's called a centurion Century means a hundred so this these centurions led 100 men so that's how the the Roman army was divided now there's a few different centurions in the Bible and it's it's neat to me that that these these centurions many times they're spoken of very well that they many times it says they were devout men they were obviously a man with a lot of authority being over a hundred people there was a centurion um that approached Jesus remember he came to Jesus and it's it's neat to me that he came to Jesus on behalf of someone else he came on behalf half of one of his servants and he come he comes to Jesus in Matthew chapter eight he comes to the Lord and he says he says my servant is paralyzed and he's suffering terribly and Jesus says oh I'll go heal him and it's really needed he says he says no he says Lord I'm not worthy that you would come under my roof this is a Roman with great Authority and he sees Jesus for what he is and he says no Lord I'm not worthy that you would come under my roof just speak the word Jesus responds to him he says I haven't seen Faith so great not in all of Israel and he says let it be as according to your faith and that that same moment his servant was healed and then there was another Centurion that was at the cross when Jesus went Jesus was up on the cross and there was an earthquake Jesus died and this Centurion looks he was probably in charge of the whole thing I would think being over a hundred men it doesn't doesn't say that in the Bible but he was there and he had his his team with him and he he sees this earthquake and he sees Jesus die and he says truly this man was the son of God wow so we see that these centurions they have a good track record as far as the Bible goes verse number two talking about this Centurion named Cornelius a devout man and one that feared God with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God always so he was he was probably rich and and it says that he feared God which means when it says that he feared God they were idolaters they worshiped all kinds of different gods you know Zeus and and all the all the different ones depending on what they needed they would pray to pray to that one but this man it says he feared God so we can assume that he at least had a part of the Jewish religion he was probably some sort of a convert now he couldn't because he was unclean he was a gentile he couldn't participate in the temple worship and he couldn't participate in certain other things that the Jews participated with but he respected this Jewish religion and he at least partly believed and and another thing is that I appreciate with him is is he gave to the poor and uh some of the other translations they say that that he prayed it says that he prayed always some of the other translations says say that he prayed often some say that he prayed continually but one thing that we know from these scriptures is that he prayed and prayer was a regular thing for this man Cornelius remember when Jesus went or when when the Lord came in a vision to ananias and and Saul of Tarsus was laying there and and he was blind and do you remember what the Lord said to ananias he said go to this man Saul for he prayeth so we see here's just another example about how important prayer is so Cornelius is up there he's praying he's he's doing the best in verse 3 he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in and saying unto him Cornelius now the ninth hour of the day if we start the day at six o'clock about when the sun comes up nine hours from six o'clock is three o'clock so when when you say it's the ninth hour of the day when you see it's the ninth hour of the day or the sixth hour of the day or whatever it is start at six and then add whatever hours it is I'll we'll have a test here in a few scriptures later and I'll call in the one that doesn't look at me um so so he he's he's there he's praying and the angel says to him Cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial unto God again look how important cornelius's prayers are and as devout of a man as this Cornelius was as important of a man as Cornelius was and as as a praying man as he was and giving as he was you can see that he respected God he was praying and he was putting his faith into action by sacrificing and giving but yet this man Cornelius was not saved yet and I think of many of us and how our lives cornelius's life our lives may not even measure up to Cornelius but we have to they need to our lives and the way that we live and the time that we spend in prayer and the time that we spend in serving others as this man Cornelius was it plows the ground and makes it to where God can plant that seed so it's very important that we do as Cornelius did here that we live that life we do our best so that God has a way that that he he has this field that he can plant this seed into our hearts because if we're living a cold hard life how can God get in there you know and after that we still need to accept God you know there must be a conversation a conversion sorry that that happens in our lives that once we have done our best and deliver A Life That's worthy of the Gospel we still need to seek that touch from the Lord as Cornelius was and now this is the Angel speaking to Cornelius and now send men to Joppa and call for one Simon whose surname is Peter now remember he was a man of authority he could send people out he lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner whose house is by the seaside he shall tell thee what thou ought us to do you know in reading this did you ever think why didn't the angel just tell him about Jesus you wonder that why didn't why if if he's here and and he's praying and then his Angel comes down don't you think it had been a lot easier for just tell him about the Lord I think he would probably would have believed the angel but that's not the way God does things God does things he wants us to work together you know he he has he has this this predestinated seed as we would call call him called Cornelius but then he asked Peter and he wants Peter to to work together and to go over and he wants Peter to preach the gospel to this man because it's going to do something that's a little bit more than even Cornelius receiving his salvation there's God has something more in store and that's something more you're going to see the conversion of Cornelius but you're going to end and all these people that were with them but you're also going to see a conversion for somebody else that other person's Peter Peter is going to receive something really big here that he never even considered before verse number seven and the angel which spake unto Cornelius was Departed and when the angel would spake unto Cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually and when he had declared these things unto them he sent them to Joppa now another thing that's very odd here is caesarea is like 30 or 40 miles from Joppa now there's disciples they're going out all over the place Apostles why didn't he just send somebody that was right there it was something that God wanted to do in Peter he had a chosen vessel in this man Peter and he wanted Peter to make this journey one of the brothers from from Cornelius from from caesarea these Gentiles he wanted them to go to Peter he wanted Peter to come back and and go through all of this hardship to accomplish this goal again working together and on the morrow as they went on their journey and they drew nigh unto the city Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour all right what is the sixth hour yes good I'm glad somebody's listening thank you brother Merle it's noon it's if we start at six we had six and and we we have we have noon so it's lunch time anyways and he became very hungry and and he would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance and he saw heaven open and a certain vessel descending upon him as it as it had been a great sheet knit at the Four Corners and let it down to the Earth we're in we're all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air and there came a voice to him rise Peter kill and eat now remember it says in verse 10 that he's hungry but Peter said not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean now the way that this Jew was raised you know he would never have eaten a catfish because it says in the Bible it says earlier in the Bible and Moses's writings that that you don't eat a fish without scales and these fish live in the mud at the bottom so Peter would have never eaten that because it was an unclean fish or this this other animal that was supposed to you have if it has a cloven hoof it's supposed to chew its cud and then they see this pig that has a cloven hoof but doesn't chew its cut and it's all nasty this animal so you're not supposed to eat that either you're supposed to live this life according to the doctrines that you've been raised with now what's so odd to me you have first of all Peter says here not so Lord so I'm I'm gonna assume that this is that this is the Lord Jesus talking if not it was an angel that was sent from him but but Peter is recognizing this person as the Lord and then Peter argues with him how many of you would argue with the Lord if he's speaking to you I wouldn't want to but he says no not Lord not so Lord I've never in anything that's unclean or that's common like the Lord's going to lead you wrong like he's going to lead you into sin and here's Peter saying not I'm not going to do it Lord I've never look at me I go to church every every service look at me I I never fellowship with with these heathens I never do anything wrong Lord I live this Pious life this was one that walked with Christ this is the one that had the revelation that that knew the prophecies All Through the Bible from Isaiah that a virgin shall conceive conceive all the many of the Psalms that says that say that he's going to suffer and die the whole purpose of making sacrifices the whole Book of Leviticus is written about this Jesus and Hosea he says out of Egypt I've called my son Peter knows all of these scriptures he's preached about him and here is this man and he's saying he's saying Peter eat and he's like no come on Peter you know so many times God will send us a gift he'll send a gift into our lives and how many times do we refuse that gift because of our way of thinking how many times will we refuse God and say I don't want it because it doesn't line up with my religion how many times do we see that just throughout or how many times as this as I'm going to read here do we see someone some family or or some person come in and I've seen it before where it's like well you have to act like us do like us and accept this or you're not one of us that's what this whole chapter that I'm reading here is about Peter argues with him and you know what he's arguing with God about he's arguing about his religion there's a very source of religion there and Peter's arguing with him saying no no no no Lord I'm not going to do that and the voice spake unto him again the second time it says this what God has cleansed that call not thou common he says how dare you repeat how dare you Peter how dare you because of your beliefs in my word make something unclean that I have cleansed how dare you what are you thinking Peter I have done this is God speaking he could say I have done a work in their lives it's not about you or your thoughts you didn't do this work I did this work and I'll go on a little aside here a little tangent that's why we see so many so-called message churches they don't grow you know what sometimes they'll grow but you know where they're growing from is they're growing from people from this mess message church over here they don't like the pastor they don't like what he says so they're going to go over to this one and then and then well this one doesn't like what the pastor says he doesn't believe in this certain Doctrine so I'm going to go over here and the body's not growing nothing's happening there they're just it's like musical chairs they just go from church to church and then one will have better music or this it'll have better this and that church will grow a little bit more but the body isn't growing we need to be out witnessing the people that need it those are the people that we need to bring in instead of trying to hammer them on the head like Peter's doing right here hammering them on the head and say that oh you you need to fall in line and I would never Lord I would never eat something unclean and it's God himself speaking to Peter this was done three times it says this was done Thrice and the vessel was received up into heaven again seems to be Peter Peter's number you know he and I love Peter I uh Peter is one of the greatest men I've ever lived but I love the way that he made mistakes man I think that's my favorite thing about Peter is that he made mistakes and they're written in the book because I can say Lord how many mistakes that I have made but yet here's this man that's filled with the Holy Ghost and is doing all kinds of Miracles and look he's rebuked right here by God now why Peter so what so let me rewind and what happened so this Vision came down there was all these animals Peter's hungry God says Peter kill kill the animals eat it Peter says no I don't need anything that's unclean and then God says you can't make something unclean that I have cleansed so Peter's thinking about this now while Peter doubted him in himself what the what this Vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from Cornelius had made an inquiry for Simon's house and stood before the gate and he called and asked whether Simon whose surname was Peter were lodged there and he and called and asked whether Simon which surname was Peter will Lodge there while Peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for I have sent them then Peter went down to the men and the gods here saying don't doubt Peter then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him for Cornelius from Cornelius and said behold I am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherewith you are come and they said Cornelius the Centurion a just man and one that feareth God and of good report among the nation of the Jews was warned from God by a Holy Angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of Thee man beautiful the the body of Christ working together you have a needy Soul over here and you have a brother over here that has the truth and it's all coming together Peter once again in his life had to think had to forsake himself had to forsake his own thinking to serve God and I and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and Cornelius waited for them and he had called together his Kinsmen and near friends I love this testimony he said he called together his his family and his close friends and they had a house meeting I am I was out riding my bike one time in Jeffersonville and I'd I'd go out and I'd see old people sitting on their porches which they do back east and I saw this old man he was sitting on his porch his name is Henry oberley and he was sitting there and and uh I I stopped you know got off my bike and took my helmet off and I said uh I said hey uh um mind if I talked to you for a minute he says come up on the porch I can't hear you I said okay so I get up there and he says he says well sit down he says what can I do for you and I said I said you ever hear of a man named William brano and he said I sure have he baptized me right down at the end of this road and I was in Utica and the end of that road was the Ohio river which is I don't know two three hundred yards away and I said really I said I sat down and started talking with him and he said he preached his first sermon in my mom's house uh you know it's like okay sure you know whatever I actually went back and searched brother Branham said he preached his first sermon in a little home meeting everything this man lined up perfectly everything that he said lined up perfectly with what brother Branham said so I said well how did that happen he says well he said uh Billy Branham was uh he used to run the the the power lines and he checked the meters and and and uh and do the the public service stuff and he said every time he'd walk by he said my mama used to preach to him I said wow really he says oh yeah and he said my mom built this house so with this big living rooms and she always wanted to have a church service in this house but she could never find a preacher and she said and he said and she asked Billy Branham he she said well let's let's have a service and I'll bring my family just like this man Cornelius I'll bring my family so they brought their family there and brother Brandon told her he says well I've never I've never had a I never preached before this would be my first time so they go into the they go into the house and there was about brother Jeremy I think like 12 people is what he said and they had that first message and uh I think of when I read this I thought about that story and how special this must have been in this little home and as Peter was coming in Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him now look at the Gentile way and we are Gentiles friends look at the Gentile way he fell down and he worshiped this man of God now we we think about how the the Americans are we see on Tick Tock and we see on the different apps and the social media we have what's called influencers and they all look alike they all look the same and they want all of us to look like them and we see that that all of the the people whether it be a a professional athlete or whether it be an influencer on social media whatever it might be but we see that the public they worship these people and they want to be like them and here we see the nature of a gentile in Cornelius and he falls down and he worships this man Peter but Peter took him up saying stand up I myself also am a man you know and having my notes right here I wish more ministers would like that that sometimes people will pay the brother a compliment or or say that they really appreciated that sermon or or they'll start to lift up a man too high and then that man becomes an absolute in their life rather than them going to God and Peter here he's like listen I'm a man just like you are don't do that and we've seen it we've seen it done so much a man of God that God will use in a mighty way people will take that man and make him God and make him infallible and make him something that that never makes a mistake or makes him perfect and the only one that's ever done that is Jesus Christ and here we see this Gentile way and here we see he does that to Peter but Peter took him up saying stand up by myself also I'm a man and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together that's beautiful his little home meeting and he said unto them you know how that it is unlaw it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or to come unto one of another Nation but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean wow Peter got the the Revelation and the interpretation of this Vision that he saw right here he knew exactly what was going on therefore came I unto you without gain saying as soon as I was sent for I asked therefore for what intent you have sent me sent from me and Cornelius said four days ago I was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold the man stood Before Me In Bright clothing and said Cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God so he's saying here listen those things that you have done for other people how you have given alms to the poor have you when you have supported these people and you've done you've done this he says that I saw that Cornelius said um therefore I came unto you without Peter says this therefore I came unto you without gain saying as soon as I was sent for I know I'm repeating myself I asked therefore for what intent you have sent me and Cornelius said four days ago I was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold the man stood Before Me In Bright clothing and said Cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms or come are had in remembrance in the sight of God send therefore to Joppa we just read this happened and call hither Simon whose surname is Peter he is lodged in the house house of one Simon a Tanner by the seaside who when he cometh shall speak unto thee immediately therefore I sent to thee and thou Hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before God to hear all the things that are commanded thee of God wouldn't it be great if we all came to church like that wouldn't it if we were prepared like this man Cornelius was prepared and we could all come together to hear the word of God I guarantee you the same thing would happen as about is what's going to happen right now then Peter opened his mouth I love it when the Bible says that he just opened his mouth and the word of the Lord came forward it wasn't Peter now this is not the man that just made these mistakes speaking then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him the word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all now Peter is going to bring this gospel into this modern day which is the role of every minister he's going to take these people and he's going to say okay here you are every new testament sermon if you'll read them is about Christ I don't know why we want to preach about anything else all the prophets preached about him they all pointed to him and every sermon that you'll read here is about the Lord Jesus he gives a little history Peter does and then he preaches another sermon about about Jesus this is Peter speaking that word I say you know which was published without all Judea and began From Galilee after the baptism which John preached how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him now these people in caesarea they probably had heard these stories and we Are Witnesses of all things which he did both in the lands of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him God raised up the third day and showed him openly it's the same sermon Paul preached it's the same sermon Peter preached at the day of Pentecost it's the same thing him God raised up on the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto Witnesses chosen before God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead Peter's saying hey I was with him I am a witness of these things and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be a judge of the quick and and the dead to give to him give all the prophets witness remember what I just said every sermons about Jesus to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word and they have the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost wow it's not just our people that can receive the Gospel it's not just everybody that that believes like me wow he can go out to someone else Jesus himself said there will be one Shepherd and one fold he didn't separate the Jews and the Gentiles he didn't separate the denominations he didn't separate these things he said I am the shepherd and you are the Sheep for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then answered then answered Peter notice they did the same thing that the Jews did they acted the same way then answered Peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as we this is one of the times and I think it may be the only time that I know about that someone actually received the Holy Spirit before they were baptized you know we don't always want to put God in a box I've been preaching lately about about putting the new wine in new flexible wine skins and that's the same thing here see God is flexible he doesn't he doesn't say that you have to that this is always the case God says you can be Anointed with oil you can have hands laid on you or like Jesus in in the Centurion you can just speak the word he gave us many different ways even even God is flexible I want to read that again for they heard them speak with tongues and magnified God then answer Peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days if the musicians could come forward and we'll close and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days now this is this is kind of a neat way to end this chapter number one they were baptized in the name of the Lord we've seen lately we've seen a lot of people coming to be baptized there they feel something in their heart and they want to give their heart to the Lord and the Lord says here's something that you can do I command you to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of your sins so we see that right here but then there's this little subtle thing that's really neat and they asked Peter can you stay with us for a little while now put yourself in Peter's position these are unclean heathens these are not people that that a Jew would want to be found being in their home or staying with them but Peter he he's he makes he's bold remember they prayed for boldness earlier in the book of Acts Peter is bold he preached to them they gave their hearts to the Lord they received the Holy Spirit then they were baptized but later on we're going to see brotherly I don't know who's it's going to fall on you or me but later on we see that Peter was in the same position outside of Israel and we see Peter was embarrassed to be fellowshipping with these heathens and I'll tell you what Saul of Tarsus who I believe then was called Paul he ripped his head off he let him have it say how dare you Paul said I was stood him to his face for he was to be blamed I think is what he said so we see here that that it's very plainly in the book of Acts is teaching us hey don't judge remember Jesus judge not that you be not judged be careful just spread that and that tell these people about the Lord Jesus every sermon as I said is about Christ so tell them about Christ don't cut them out don't force them to do anything we have later on again we'll see a man named Titus and we'll see a man named Timothy and we'll see that this this Covenant of circumcision was very important to the Jews and we see that here comes Timothy and because he's going to preach the gospel to the Jews he gets circumcised and this man I believe it was Titus says no I'm not doing it and Paul did not rebuke him for it Paul said that was his choice it did not change one bit titus's walk with the Lord and the same friends the same with us we hold God's word as precious to us but we need to be careful that our testimony and our Doctrine it doesn't just become like Peter's where that even though he had the Holy Spirit even though he was saved it doesn't it's not like Peter said that says well you have to do it this way and I know I preached that a lot and I'm going to keep preaching it because I believe that it's been a hindrance to the people over over the past decades I believe it's really hindered good people putting God in a box and saying that you have God you have to do it this way like Peter said not so Lord talking to God himself [Music] not so Lord no no no no no no no we have no right we have no right to do it what we do is we say Jesus Christ saved me from my sins Jesus Christ is the reason I'm here and I serve him would you like to serve him and if you would here's what his word says that's the way that we should be amen do you like the book of Acts I love it it's it's so exciting to me it's it's just it's so applicable to today you know you see it's like Peter that's God but how many times do we do it say you have to you have to come my way no no no no no no no and as I said I believe it's been the biggest hindrance to so many people over the past 60 50 60 70 years it's just hindered it's hindered us trying to put God in a box just just as we see here in this book of Acts and and we're gonna it didn't stop on this one there's gonna be more and more examples of it happening I appreciate Cornelius his love for the Lord I appreciate his dedication and and God honored it he plowed that field the angel came down said Cornelius [Music] this Lord I said go sin man go get this man Peter way over there there may have been a Phillip or a or a uh Nathaniel or or even a genre James over here but he sent way over to Joppa to get this man Peter because Peter also needed a conversion amen let's stand God bless you all I hope you do love this book of Acts I hope you're I hope you're in it hope you're you're reading it and and enjoying it because it is a it's just a tremendous tremendous book I was telling brother Lyle that scares me I'm afraid that that uh we're gonna get finished with it then what do we do and this is a it's a thick book God bless you all brother Aaron if you sing a couple songs for us [Music] yes God still moves good in the cars [Music] nor does his love [Music] yes God still moves Paul if you come in close [Music] yes people [Music] thank you Heavenly Father Lord God we are so grateful that we 've been to come and hear your word this this evening Lord father God how we appreciate this precious sacrifice you've given us and amen Lord we're just asking that you would continue to manifest yourself in our lives draw us closer to you father God just be with us as we drive home and keep
