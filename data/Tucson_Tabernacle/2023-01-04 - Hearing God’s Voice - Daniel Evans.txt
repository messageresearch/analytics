me remind me [Music] [Applause] I had a little reminder today of how God takes care of his his own I was doing a customer service today and they had four young children I think it was four six eight and ten and they were quite rambunctious and mama was having a hard time because I'm working in the kitchen and they're they're running through it climbing over the countertops and just going they're having fun with the oldest the oldest one was a 10 year old daughter and mama she started doing something with her phone and she put it full blast and my mama got upset took the phone away and the little girl began to mouth off to her mother and I'm closer than this to here and my first thought was oh my she needs a weapon but I waited a little bit I said no mama needs some encouragement right about now because she's just been totally embarrassed you know so after she kind of calmed down and and things I told her you know we all go through that part in life I have six daughters and there were some days that you know I walk out the door to calm down first but I said you know we made it through we're here today I said you'll be all right it'll be okay and such a smile came over her face he goes really I said yes and I walked Walked Out and then left and I said Lord I know you're good to us but we can share that with someone else too you know and it just meant so much to her you know my first thought was I'll help you whoop them if you need some help you know but but God's been so good to us and some like as our sister saying remind me Lord remind me sometimes your mercy and Grace To Us amen Lord you are so precious to me [Music] Lord you are so precious to me and Lord You Are so precious to me and I love yes I yes I love [Music] you first love me [Music] and I love you yes I

[Music] to worship you oh my soul take your my king in what you hear may it be a Sweet Sweet Sound oh I love you Lord [Music] one two worship you oh my soul take joy my king may it be a Sweet Sweet Sound let's hear our sisters sing it now the brothers on the last part take joy my name in what you hear may it be a sweet sweet and as you stand we'll all sing it together one more time [Music] [Applause] to worship you oh my soul Rachel take joy my king in what you hear foreign [Music] got to turn my microphone on God bless you all while you're standing let's open up our Bibles turn to First Kings chapter 19. it's good to see everyone out on a Wednesday night another week praise the Lord foreign Kings chapter 19 verse 11. familiar scripture we've all read it we've probably all heard many sermons on it the Lord speaking to his servant Elijah he says this and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind to rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the Wind and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of Fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and if you'd also turn to James chapter 5 I'll read one verse James chapter 5 verse 17. another very familiar scripture he says this Elias was a man's subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months it's about our heads father thank you for your worth we love it Lord and we love this example of this man Elijah and how we can relate because it says by the Apostle James that he was a man like we are father I pray that you would bless this service be with us tonight we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen now bless you again take your you can take your seats I appreciate it brother Aaron's testimony imagine if uh brother Aaron would have followed the flesh and uh said something to that lady a lot of good that would have done but no he said something he said something kind the Holy Spirit working through him and who knows what good that's going to do in the long term brother why I don't know these two sisters sitting next to you God bless you welcome it's good to have you I am I feel like the past three days I feel like Sunday was like a month ago we've been we've been working and and trying to make some progress I've met with Brother Dan and uh brother Nathan and working on the website I've also met with Brother Trevor eamond a a good friend a brother and a web designer and a minister in Jeffersonville um and uh brother Jordan has an excuse why I haven't been working with him uh baby um but uh yeah hey yeah thank the Lord better than that wonderful it's a little girl um but uh we're working on on the website and I've set a goal to try to get it done by this Sunday and uh it's not going to be it's not going to be perfect there's going to be a lot of work to do but uh hopefully if the Lord's willing brother Nathan you'll be given a presentation on it on Sunday morning if we can get it done um I wanted to get it done before Harmony so we can have a calendar on there so everybody can look on the website and see what's going on and see what the schedule is um there's a lot that we need to get done and it's a Time friends that these things shouldn't just be approached haphazardly these are very very important things that are going to affect a lot of people and I don't want to just do something because we know how to do it I want to seek the Lord in everything that we do because there is a there's a lot at stake I mean there's a lot of things that Harmony in the desert's coming up I talked with brother Bobby I don't see him here I talked about the Bobby Wertz last night I'm going to meet with him tomorrow about the order of things for harmony next week it starts Wednesday and then it goes through Sunday we'll need volunteers for ushers volunteers for parking and who knows what else I'll know after tomorrow meeting with brother Bobby I'm proud of our church I'm proud of our people and I want to make sure that it's our brothers that are shaking hands I want to make it sure that it's our sisters that are showing the way and um I take pride in our church pride in a good way not in a bad way but there's there's some other decisions that we have to make in the future we need to talk about Sunday school praying about that um any changes to the music program to instruments and all that the the youth meetings that brother Peter started I want to continue those uh maybe even make some changes to them um and then the ministry here in the church how often we're going to minister when we're going to minister when if we're going to keep the same sermon times if if um even if we should take up an offering in the church I know that we've never done that brother Branham did it you know brother Branham taught that we should do it but this is also a different church we don't know if we want to introduce that or not these things require a lot of prayer and another thing they require a lot of prayer not from me only but from all of us because we're a body we need to seek God's voice it's a very very important time that's going to be going to be talking about tonight is hearing God's voice and what does God's voice sound like so many times it's hard to hear and I have to admit the past maybe a year I'll pray about things and the Lord will lead me and as he does all of us but it's been hard for me to hear that voice that I'm going to be talking about today but I believe in the past week he's spoken to me twice one time I announced someone right before Bill Lyle's sermon I believe he gave me a scripture and I announced that to the church right out right after the sermon the sermon that brother Lyle preached but I've been seeking him and what I want to talk about tonight is what does that voice sound like there's um there was a question that was asked the other night when we did our questions and answers and the question was asked how do you feel the Lord is leading you to be the pastor of this church and the way I answered was that when I get something on my heart or I get excited about something then don't just jump but wait because it could be just emotions that you're feeling so I said that I I set it aside and I pray about it and and I continue to pray about it and many many times probably more often than not that burden will leave me and it'll just kind of fade away and it's like okay good I'm glad I didn't go do that I'm glad I didn't move in that direction but then other times it just stays there and it just sometimes it just keeps getting stronger and stronger and the way that I answered that question the other night is is this burden has gotten stronger and stronger and stronger to this point and it hasn't gone away and that's when all of us are praying and when we're putting these things before the Lord these things for the church make sure each of us are praying make sure all of you are praying because each one of us has a role in this church don't forget every single one of us has a part you have a part you need to be praying Lord what do you want me to do how do you want me to contribute to this church not so much Lord how can this church serve me but how can I serve this church so when we're praying about that keep it before the Lord and we might get excited about something I might say I want to be the song leader that ain't my calling but I might get excited about it brother Wilson and say Hey you know I think I could do a good job and then people are like wow you know he's terrible but if I keep putting that before the Lord I believe he would take that burden away from me and that's all of us make sure friends that we are putting these things before the Lord seeking the Lord's voice and he might speak to you like I believe you spoke to me last week or he might do like almost always happens with me as I keep putting it before him and then pretty soon I have to make a step now the world will pressure you and say move go you have to make that step right now go you have to make this decision and sometimes you have to I mean if you step on a rattlesnake you can jump you know don't pray about it just jump get off it there's times like that but then there's other times which is most of the time you're getting pressured pressured wait a minute be still know that I'm God put it before him keep keep putting it before and then you can take a step the Bible says that the word is to a lamp to our feet it lights that next step it doesn't light it all the way down to the end it just lights this next step it may be College it may be Lord what career do you want me to have as a young man or a young lady what who do you want me to marry what these great decisions that our young people make don't jump and run take a step and then Lord do you want me to keep going on this path but he might turn it this way but if you're all the way down there you're gonna have to come all the way back and then go down this way so always put things before the Lord and wait on him and then move with faith you a lot of times you have to take a step but move as he moves the children of Israel when they were in the wilderness they had a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of Fire by night and they followed that leading when it got up and moved they got up and moved but notice they didn't stop they would stop for a period of time as the Lord LED but so many times we stop and we stop moving we get complacent we get happy with where we're at and we stop seeking we stop pressing we stop praying and we notice then God stops speaking and we we stand there and and we're I'm happy with my house I'm happy with my friends and I you know I like to go on vacation I like to do all this and then we lose sight of the Lord remember that in this age it's the only age there's Jesus standing at the door and knocking it's the only age that has really put them out and that's this age and we have to be very careful where we're at what we're doing always putting God saying Lord is this your will and sometimes many times that I've seen I'll be talking about tonight the Lord speaks to us gives us a certain direction starts us moving and then we dig in in that direction and we're unwilling to move because we know that God God moved us in this direction but then we get our mindset and then we put them out we know that God sent me this way so I'm going to go this way and God is saying I sent you that way but I wanted you to turn a corner but you just kept going we need to be careful about that and I'll be talking about that in the scriptures also I we have to be careful also that everything becomes a sign everything becomes some spiritual revelation you have to be very very careful with that because when we are seeking a sign when we are seeking vindication we'll get it no matter if it's right or wrong we'll get that Vindication I'll give a couple examples in a little while you can open up your Bible and all of a sudden wow this is a miracle I opened up my Bible to this you twist it a little bit it must be what I want and not necessarily the way God is leading I talked the other night I was so scared of telling this testimony that I had about seeing that Vision that I saw I was like I can't lord I can't say this because they're going to think that I'm weird or they're they're going to think that that I'm trying to make myself something that I'm not or they're going to make me something that I'm not and they're going to say oh you're you know you you have a gift or something that's like none of those things just want to give a testimony of what had happened and this book that lays in front of me is full of testimonies like that and I want us to have more but we have to seek God and when that happened to me I was desperately Desperately Seeking him and when he spoke it was a familiar voice that I knew was him because I had heard it before um so just because it looks right and it feels right and when I had that experience I could have taken that experience and ran somewhere with it and what had happened was was God told me he said I made you a preacher to rightly divide my word didn't tell me I was a pastor didn't tell me I was a prophet didn't tell me that I was an apostle or any of these other things he just said I was a preacher I could have taken his word and made it say something that I wanted it to say but I have more respect for God when he does speak to me like that and I thank God that he could trust me in in giving me a little voice and I think all of us have probably heard when he speaks to each of us I am for the church I want us to mature as a body to where our cries out to the Lord that they're not for ourselves we need to mature so when we are crying out to the lord it's for our Brethren and it's for other people that's I believe when God really starts to speak to us and when we're praying and I'm going to get to the scriptures here in a minute there are so many voices in the world more than any other time you know we have we have the voice of the television we have the voice of the radio we have the voice of social media we have the voice of the internet we have the voice of our jobs we have the voice of our friends we have all these different voices that are always going on in our heads and when we get down to pray you think those voices just stop they're loud obnoxious voices and when you get down to pray it just hits you and hit you and hit you and hit you and then you start praying and and we start thinking Lord help me with my job Lord help me with this Lord help me with that and and the all these voices are going on and that's not how God's voice sounds as I read in the scripture it's a still small voice but you know what it is when it speaks and then when we get on our knees also we'll just lose thought get down and start to pray and my mind will go anywhere but but what I want to pray about and I'll start thinking about work one thing that I start thinking about a lot is what I'm going to preach on next Lord it's not you know here I am and that's my mind it's not him speaking and I want to when we distinguish God's voice from our voice that is a sure voice and it's not something that's dominating your thoughts it's not this loud um obnoxious voice that we hear so often in our minds the Bible is constantly especially in the Book of Psalms it's constantly telling us to to be still and it's constantly saying to wait on God and as far as the direction we're moving in the church we need to move but constantly putting it before him constantly praying and in every decision that you all make whether it be who you're going to marry whether it be the job that you take wait on him Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31 says this you all know it because we sing it they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint let me uh I did this when I was in Indonesia um and it worked so I'm going to try it here brother Branham says this first quote it's such a beautiful message this message is uh 58 1005 hear his voice listen to this hopefully this will work [Music] and all the 80 years of training had taught him it made a different man out of him it'll make a different man and woman out of you if you'll just stand still long enough to hear his voice like Samuel in still don't be excited if you want something of God asking now listen see what he's going to say about it just open up your heart say what about it Lord Jesus just stay there if he doesn't answer the first five hours then wait another if he doesn't answer later he'll answer tomorrow if he doesn't answer this week he will next week stay there tell the answers hear his voice speak back and say yes I'm the Lord that healeth thee and it's all over you're settling okay I'm the Lord who forgives all thy sins now go and send them on damn you then you can go free you're all right but you want to be sure that you hear that voice amen amen you know and I've been talking how feel like I haven't heard that voice he's helped me and he's led me but I had an experience last Tuesday and I was praying about the church which I have been for a long time and I was asking the Lord Lord what do you want for the church I don't want us to get into something that's going to hurt the people I don't want to I don't want to be wrong Lord what do you want what is your perfect will and just crying out every morning I'd wake up and I'd be praying and as much as I could at all of my prayers Lord crying what do you want for the church and on Tuesday it's on my knees as praying and he said this and it was that same voice by the day and that I know I've heard many many times he said enough don't pray about it again didn't tell me what was going to happen didn't say that the church is going to do this or or any of that but he spoke and let me tell you when God speaks it doesn't matter what he says whatever he says is his Sovereign will and that is exactly what I want he didn't tell me this is we're going to have this pastor that Pastor this Deacon or whatever it is he just said I heard you enough you don't have to ask anymore and I knew just trusting God trust in him and it was that still small voice that spoke to me First Kings chapter 19. and we know that Elijah he had just come down from Mount Carmel where incredible miracles killed 450 of Bales profits you know the the um the fire came down and consumed the sacrifices you know the story and he goes and now he's again seeking God's voice and he's trying to get quiet before the Lord Jezebel that crazy woman was after him and she's gonna she's gonna kill him and he doesn't know what to do and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all he had slain all the prophets with the sword then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not die life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to Beersheba which belonged to Judah and left his servant there but he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat under the juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it isn't enough now oh Lord take my life for I am not better than my fathers listen to him pray it Lord things are bad I need help this is really bad Lord are you hearing me and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree then behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went on the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights into Horeb to the Mount of God the Mount of God and he came tether unto a cave and he lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou hear Elijah notice that the word came to the prophet in the form of a question I think God knew what he was doing God is he's all-knowing he knew what was going on but he felt God wanted to ask this man what are you doing here watch Elijah's answer and he said I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel I've forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with a sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away James said Elijah is a man like we are how many of us have been in that place Lord what do you want me to do I I don't understand I'm having all these problems in life Elijah's down on the dumps and he's thinking about himself he was struggling to hear God's voice and he was doing his best to get quiet he went into the mountains and then into the cave and here he is all worked up and depressed and acting the way it was to the point that he thought that he was the only one right in the world everybody else is wrong but me why Lord what do you everybody's wrong nobody wants to serve you I'm the only one and now they're trying to kill me too everybody's against me and Elijah was like we are you know like I said we pray about these things but those voices that are in our head they're really loud and they really press on us and I even even with with Within the Christian Community even within the message Community some says we're not preaching enough about brother branham's message other says oh you preached too much about brother Branham oh you need to preach more about the Lord Jesus and less about brother Branham you should be playing the tapes in the church and how can you preach when you have the unadulterated word of God through the prophet here straight from the prophet and we can listen to a tape and then the other one says I can barely stay awake when you're playing a tape I need somebody up in the pulpit everybody's got their own perspective just like Elijah did and you know what I'm the only one that's right everybody else is wrong I've got exactly how we should run our church and then we hear when we when we have decisions to make we hear this thing say that says you have to pray through we hear Brother Branham says you got to pray through we hear the evangelists come through and he says you have to pray through and then we hear the pastor and he says you have to pray through what does praying through mean praying through means you're praying and those voices that are in your head and my head in your head those voices that are constantly coming they start to die down they start to get quieter they start to the volume starts to go down and you start to get quiet before the Lord and then like Elijah then you can start to hear that voice speak it says uh let me let me play another one could you hear that okay Let's uh let's do that again this is paragraph 68 my brother same same message and brother and I I think that we should listen to this one this is really good um same tape that I mentioned it's right there here we go again no wonder the voice of God is a rare thing today is smothered out so many things that dim and take away to a place I'm telling dogs are our senses until we can't hear the voice of God our senses of where we are to shake ourselves and realize that you are men and women and you are the creation of God you were put you're just serve him our prayers Lord we are here to serve you we are men and women of God and we're always crying out Lord help me Lord help me Lord help me and then sometimes they'll give you a little experience but it wasn't like he gave to me I heard you he probably would have said I heard you the first time and then you know thank you God thank you that you know my situation and that you really care I was um another time that this happened I was upset I was working in Jeffersonville and I go in on the weekends and I'd get the work done that I didn't have phone calls and visitors and all that on the weekends so I would get the work that I needed to get done on the on the weekends and then I would spend as much time as I could in the chapel a little little church that we had inside the building praying and I was upset I was I was really upset at two brothers one of them was my dad and um another another was a brother that I work with and it seemed like every decision that they were making was wrong and I was walking back to the chapel and I said Lord what is going on why do you keep why do they keep making these decisions why do they keep doing these things that seem like they're against your your word and the wrong decisions and not being able to get along with people Lord what's going on and as I was walking that voice that same voice it said I made them that way you expect too much amen and I look at I believe it's in job that says that every man that's born of a woman is full of trouble and how can we have these high expectations even from each other yes and then condemn each other when God's the one that made us that way we should all be getting better we should all be trying but make sure our expectations for each other are not different or not too high because God has expectations for us too let me go on to this next next scripture verse number 11. and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the behold the Lord pass by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the Wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake we forget about this scripture that God passed by and then there was a wind and then there was an earthquake but it was because God passed by now the voice wasn't in the wind the voice wasn't in the earthquake but God still passed by so we're looking at this wind and this earthquake this great things that happened powerful loud all of this stuff going on yet Elijah was there wait a minute he's not in that and the earthquake hits and and we'd think I was just praying about something earthquake hits I have my answer no God wasn't in the worth the earthquake but it did happen because he passed by there's a there was a decades ago there was a meeting young people um wasn't wasn't all youth but it was you know the 20-somethings and and the uh at the end of the service the Spirit came down in the service they came to the altar God passed by the Spirit came down and people people were shouting and they were praising the Lord and many of them were speaking in tongues God passed by the great things were happening and there at the altar was a young lady and there was a young man praying asking the Lord for a spouse asking the Lord for this Here Comes This powerful Spirit the Lord passed by great wind coming through great earthquake coming through there they are at the altar and all this is going on and and the tongues are going on and and people are screaming and the girl looks up and the boy looks up and their eyes meet pray for a husband praying for a wife oh that's him that's her that must be with all of this going on a few months later they're married get married after that experience they get married have a child turned out to be an absolutely horrible marriage absolutely terrible there what happened was they they got married the the um they have this child they tried to stay for together for a while ended up just hating each other and all because they got too worked up it was God don't forget it was God just like it was God that brought the earthquake he passed by the wind he passed by but God was not in the earthquake and he was not in the wind but he was still God don't be careful always be ready and the problem is we as human beings we want our way and something big will happen like this and we'll put our own interpretation on it and then it must be God and we get off like like this young man and this young lady and this poor young man that they produced he hates his dad today has no contact with his dad he's miserable his mother's miserable because she's gone all these years and not not married and he's just gone the husband all because they get caught up in the Wind they got caught up in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and as I said before it doesn't matter what that voice says it's God speaking it doesn't have to agree with what I want if it's God it's God and I want to do whatever it says and then you have that feeling when you know it's him a real Christian it doesn't matter what it says I'm going to do it and it makes you feel good most of the time when I've heard that voice most of the time it's been correction for me another time I was uh again same situation that I was when I when the Lord spoke to me on that time I was walking to the Chapel of kin and I was so busy and I needed help I was answering all of these emails all the time with all these people that that had questions about about the word and new Believers and they were asking questions people were coming in and I was on the phone I was always praying with people and then I also had I was publishing a magazine I had a whole staff underneath me and they were waiting for me to get my job done and I'm walking I'm walking to the to the um to the chapel and and I'm saying Lord I need help I just I can't handle it I need help I'm doing this magazine and I'm writing these articles and and I and it's killing me and I'm walking along and he spoke and he said this he says what if I don't want to do that I had never considered then maybe he didn't want to publish that magazine I had never even considered all this inspiration that I had and everything that I was doing and and it's so exciting and all the blessing it was to the people I never considered God he was blessing it and everything was going good and and then he asked me what if I don't want to do that oh Lord I'm sorry and all the decisions that we're making now it may sound good everything may be just wonderful let's let's move forward with this and let's do these things but remember what if he doesn't want to do that you notice he answered me with a question it's okay to answer as if the question he did it through our example here Elijah and all this that had happened to Elijah watch what Elijah does what's the reverence that the prophet has um you know this I believe it's the seraphims in Isaiah that they covered their face with wings and they covered their feet with wings and then they had a set of wings that they could fly you know that story watch what uh watch how Elijah answers when he finally does hear God's voice and it was so when Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what do us thou hear Elijah second time God's asking that question and again God knows all things and it looked like in the Bible looks like it's copied and pasted Elijah answers the exact same way and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts because the children of Israel are forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away compared to verse 10 it's exactly the same and we look at God's voice and God's voice is very seldom patting us on the back and telling us you're good you're doing fine just just keep on going and he may say that but it's not usually the case always God's voice has a purpose it's a purpose for us to do something it's not we're crying out and we're Lord things are so bad he just ignored what Elijah said and he speaks this and the Lord said unto him go return on thy way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint Hazel to be king over Syria and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of shapeath and a bamaloa shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escape of the sword of Hazel shall jehu slay in him that escapeth from The Sword of jehu shall Elisha slay look at the purpose very specific purpose he didn't pad Elijah on the back and say oh you're fine you know no it's you're a good you're a good prophet and you're a good servant and and everything's okay we do that to each other that's why we're here we need to encourage each other we need to lift each other up and God uses us to do that but usually when he's speaking it's a purpose and he does not waste a word in anything that he says his words are so perfect everything is short and when God speaks to us he can say just a few words and a volume of books could never touch what he says because it brings it has Revelation that goes on with it and then the next verse is really is neat and God says what Elijah was praying I'm the only one and things are all bad God still loves us and he answered his question right here ye have left me seven thousand in Israel yea I have left me 7 000 in Israel all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him brother Jeremy I'm glad I got it right this time when I was answering questions I I actually made a mistake I said that it was uh I forgot the the brother's name that was Elijah's servant and I'm glad that I got a chance to make it right in in this sermon but he said no no no no Elijah you're not the only one I've got I've got many others and and I'm using them also and I I think friends and and I'll I'll wrap it up if the musicians could come I don't want to it's Wednesday night I don't want to take too long I want you to remember what I say and that's why I try to try to keep it short but remember this voice that God speaks it has a purpose in it and we have to get quiet we have to get quiet we have to pray through because if we're getting in on our knees and we're praying and all of these voices which they are on all of us am I right these voices are hitting us and we're thinking if we're not thinking about work if that's not it we're thinking about somebody said this about about me or or this this other person or were all this turbulence in the water let the waters calm down get quiet before the Lord ask him Lord what is your will and take the time to do it he wants to talk to us and as we're moving forward as a church that's why I wanted to I wanted to preach about this on Wednesday night brother Joe because Wednesday night or generally as I've said before the pillars in the church are a lot more visible usually it's the Wednesday night crowd that are really making things happen and I wanted to talk about this subject to us here because we are the leaders in the church everyone here as I look out across this audience these are the leaders these are the ones that make things happen so let's pray together and as we move forward ask the lord lord what do you want me to do for your people and pray for each other and let's do like Elijah get quiet and hear that voice speak to us amen will you do it I want you to listen to that tape brother Matthew could you put that tape one of those quotes up again
