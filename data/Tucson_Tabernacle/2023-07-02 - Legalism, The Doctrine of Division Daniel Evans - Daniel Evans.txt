[31:35] to Tucson Tabernacle
[31:37] and uh I was given a name cousin
[31:42] Jonathan
[31:43] then for two months that name was
[31:46] deleted
[31:48] so I was told that when you don't go to
[31:50] Tucson Tabernacle they delete your name
[31:54] so cousin Jonathan was deleted except
[31:57] the pastor and brother Paul and brother
[32:00] Jeremy they were calling cousin Jonathan
[32:04] in Phoenix
[32:05] the prayers from this place are very
[32:07] dangerous
[32:09] and I'm in Phoenix
[32:11] and I'm thinking that maybe the Lord
[32:13] wanted me to be in Phoenix
[32:15] and I found something to do because of
[32:18] scripture
[32:20] and I worked there one month
[32:22] in the next month I don't get paid
[32:26] I said where am I not getting paid
[32:28] no answer
[32:30] we are 10 people there I see my friends
[32:33] being paid I'm not being paid
[32:36] so I say should I apply the patience of
[32:39] Abraham if I apply the patience of
[32:42] Abraham
[32:43] will I eat will I send something home
[32:46] and I didn't know that it was the
[32:49] prayers of the cousins here they wanted
[32:51] their cousin back to do so
[32:53] and uh
[32:55] I go to my employer said why am I not
[32:59] being paid
[33:01] and he says okay
[33:02] and your job is finished you can go back
[33:06] and that was on when is the last week
[33:09] just like that says here is your money
[33:11] you can go back I said okay I go back
[33:15] say yeah go back
[33:18] so okay I said brother Silas the job is
[33:21] finished I have to come back but I said
[33:24] that says praise the Lord
[33:27] [Applause]
[33:29] I thought Buenos Aires would be very
[33:32] worried for me and feel for me but the
[33:34] brother James is praise the Lord
[33:38] that's what we are praying for oh my God
[33:40] and past the same brother said has to
[33:43] come and pick me and I'm back to Tucson

[34:05] person that we want so I have found a
[34:07] job and I'm working in Tucson can you
[34:10] believe it
[34:13] so I just realized that the cousins were
[34:18] not happy
[34:19] that I should live Tucson because none
[34:22] of them called me
[34:24] none of them sister Rachel never called
[34:27] me uh sister Naomi never called me and I
[34:32] said okay they have deleted the number

[46:01] start
[46:03] verse 8.
[46:09] [Music]
[46:19] Galatians chapter 1 verse 8 reads like
[46:22] this
[46:24] but though we
[46:27] are an angel from heaven preach any
[46:28] other gospel unto you then that which we
[46:31] have preached unto you let him be
[46:33] accursed
[46:35] as we said before so say I now again
[46:40] If any man preach any other gospel unto
[46:42] you then that ye have received let him
[46:46] be accursed
[46:48] for do I now persuade men or God
[46:52] or do I seek to please men
[46:55] for if I yet pleased men
[46:57] I should not be the servant of Christ
[47:00] but I certify you Brethren that the
[47:03] gospel which was preached of me is not
[47:05] after man
[47:07] of course the Apostle Paul saying those
[47:10] words let's pray
[47:12] almighty God we thank you for
[47:15] giving us another day
[47:17] Lord we thank you for the reading of
[47:19] your word
[47:21] and I know Lord
[47:23] that my words will fail but the words
[47:26] that I just read if they come out of
[47:28] this book that they will never fail
[47:31] Lord I pray that your anointing would be
[47:34] here today
[47:35] the Lord that you bless us with your
[47:37] presence
[47:38] in Jesus Christ's name
[47:40] amen God bless you can take your seeds
[47:47] it's good to see
[47:48] all of you are out in the house of the
[47:50] Lord today it's especially good to see
[47:52] the visitors
[47:53] with us
[47:55] brother I see you back there my brother
[47:57] God bless you raise your hand so
[47:59] everybody can look back and see you back

[48:04] it's um
[48:06] had a note Brother David
[48:08] sister Amber's husband God bless you
[48:10] Brother David raise your hand
[48:12] you can do it welcome my brother it's
[48:15] good to have you brother you're welcome
[48:17] here feel comfortable and I'd like to
[48:21] meet you after service if you wouldn't
[48:22] mind I'd like to shake your hand I
[48:23] haven't met you yet God bless you I
[48:25] don't know if I don't see necessarily
[48:27] any other
[48:28] visitors
[48:30] mayor Lee's pointing
[48:32] let me tell you something Mama Mary
[48:34] that's my mother-in-law
[48:38] Melissa is not a visitor
[48:41] Melissa and Heath God bless you it's
[48:43] good it's good to see you Melissa you're
[48:45] always welcome too God bless you it's
[48:47] it's good to have you all
[48:49] thanks merely I I might have looked over
[48:52] it
[48:53] I'm blessed to be here blessed to be
[48:56] here this morning
[48:58] I think about
[49:01] um the scripture I just read and I think
[49:03] that it's often misinterpreted
[49:06] I think it's probably usually
[49:07] misinterpreted
[49:09] I am
[49:11] the title of my sermon today is is
[49:15] legalism the doctrine of division
[49:18] so why would I read
[49:20] a scripture like that
[49:23] that Paul says that an angel if an angel
[49:25] from heaven preaches any other gospel
[49:28] then that which we have already preached
[49:30] to you let him be accursed
[49:33] and then I titled my sermon legalism the
[49:36] doctrine of division
[49:38] so how do those two things tie in
[49:41] together
[49:42] well
[49:44] that scripture
[49:46] that letter
[49:48] written to the churches at galatia
[49:52] was written
[49:54] in direct conflict and to correct
[49:58] legalism within the church
[50:02] the whole book of Galatians is written
[50:04] for that
[50:06] and
[50:08] I think about
[50:11] churches Christian churches
[50:15] throughout the world
[50:18] and you'll find that there is one common
[50:22] attack that comes after every Christian
[50:26] Church
[50:28] this one included through the years
[50:32] and I'm thankful to say that we haven't
[50:36] had to combat that
[50:40] recently
[50:42] but I want you to know it's coming
[50:44] because it always comes
[50:46] to Christian churches
[50:49] and it's going to be coming here
[50:51] and I pray that this sermon this morning
[50:53] will help you to be ready for it when
[50:57] you see it rise up right now we have
[51:00] this group of brother David's good to
[51:02] see you my brother it's good good to
[51:04] haven't seen you in a while God bless
[51:05] you it's um we have a group now that
[51:08] seems to be in Harmony and seems to love
[51:11] one another and and we see our numbers
[51:13] our ranks starting to grow and and
[51:15] things are looking good but as I read
[51:18] from a quote last weekend that the
[51:22] devil's going to come against us
[51:24] so our time is coming
[51:28] and
[51:30] the what we see
[51:32] is many times the attack
[51:37] on a body will come from within
[51:41] it'll come from within the um we see
[51:45] that
[51:46] um
[51:47] cancer
[51:49] we see how cancer will start inside of a
[51:52] body
[51:53] I have a friend in Jeffersonville that
[51:56] I've had some good fellowship with over
[51:59] the years and a few years ago we were we
[52:02] were talking and and he was describing
[52:05] how a cancer works
[52:07] and what happens is inside this body
[52:11] there is a cell
[52:14] single cell
[52:16] that becomes perverted it becomes
[52:19] mutated
[52:21] and the body when that happens within
[52:23] the body if it's a bruise or if it's if
[52:25] it's something if there's a problem then
[52:27] the body will attack it and destroy that
[52:30] cell
[52:31] but the most deceiving ones
[52:35] are the cells that look like all of the
[52:39] other cells
[52:40] whether it be in the pancreas or whether
[52:42] it be in the lungs or or whether
[52:44] wherever it would be this cell looks
[52:47] just like all of the other cells so it's
[52:51] but it's wrong
[52:53] it's got a perversion inside of it's got
[52:55] a mutation inside of it so it will start
[52:58] to multiply and start to spread and
[53:01] because it looks like everything else
[53:03] the body doesn't see it
[53:06] the body's defense mechanisms don't
[53:09] recognize
[53:11] this foreign body that's starting to
[53:14] grow so it doesn't it doesn't attack it
[53:18] it doesn't come after that cell until
[53:22] it's too late
[53:25] and until that cancer has become big
[53:27] enough and strong enough to well now the
[53:29] body can't combat it and then it starts
[53:33] to multiply and it starts to grow and
[53:35] eventually it kills the body
[53:39] and the same thing with the church
[53:42] there'll be something that sneaks in
[53:47] and
[53:49] it looks maybe it looks like everything
[53:51] else
[53:53] but it starts to spread
[53:57] and many times it's a Doctrine
[54:00] and that's what I'm going to talk about
[54:01] this morning
[54:03] and then it continues to spread in
[54:04] before the people know it all of a
[54:06] sudden there's Division and hatred
[54:08] within the church and the church splits
[54:14] and it starts moving out
[54:17] and then the people start hating each
[54:19] other
[54:20] start fighting against each other
[54:24] and that is what happened
[54:28] right here
[54:30] that this book this letter that Paul
[54:34] writes to the Believers in galatia
[54:36] that's what happened to them
[54:38] now if you've been following along in
[54:39] our study on the book of Acts
[54:42] I preached on Acts 15.
[54:45] and how in Acts 15 what had happened is
[54:48] Paul was out on missionary trips and and
[54:51] he he comes to this city in the this
[54:55] area of the world called galatia he
[54:58] comes to this city and he founds this
[55:01] church he has many converts and he
[55:03] founds this church in the city of
[55:05] Antioch
[55:08] and these people most of them are
[55:11] gentile people but there's also Jews
[55:13] mixed in there and they're they're
[55:16] worshiping they give their hearts to the
[55:18] Lord Jesus Remember nobody knew about
[55:20] Jesus Christ back then
[55:22] so he's witnessing and he and these
[55:25] people they start to see that because of
[55:28] the grace of Christ because Christ died
[55:31] for their sins that they can be forgiven
[55:34] of their sins
[55:36] the Jewish believers
[55:39] they are accepting they have accepted
[55:41] the same Christ
[55:43] and they have accepted salvation through
[55:46] Christ
[55:47] so this church is growing and it is such
[55:50] an important church the church at
[55:53] Jerusalem is considered the First
[55:55] Christian Church
[55:56] the church at Antioch is considered the
[55:59] second
[56:00] Christian Church
[56:01] great place in fact Antioch it's so
[56:06] important that is the first place the
[56:08] word Christian was ever used
[56:11] because these people were christ-like
[56:15] so they the this this church forms and
[56:18] it starts to spread throughout this area
[56:20] of galatia to these different towns if
[56:22] you've been following with the book of
[56:24] Acts you can see that the brothers are
[56:25] going different places and they're
[56:27] starting these churches and they're
[56:28] they're they're leading people to the
[56:30] Lord Jesus and then all of a sudden
[56:35] these two brothers
[56:39] from the church at Jerusalem
[56:42] they come into this newly formed church
[56:47] at Antioch
[56:50] and these people are rejoicing they're
[56:52] happy they're they're they're leading
[56:54] their families to the lord they're
[56:55] receiving their salvation through Grace
[56:58] and they understand how how wonderful
[57:01] the Lord Jesus is that their sins can be
[57:03] wiped away and then these two brothers
[57:04] they come in and they start preaching
[57:08] the doctrine of circumcision
[57:13] and other doctrines
[57:16] diet
[57:17] how they should eat certain of these
[57:21] Jewish Traditions all of these
[57:22] Commandments and they're saying that
[57:24] that did you know the prophet Moses
[57:27] and these new Believers are oh we
[57:29] believe Moses
[57:31] Moses was a prophet of God did you know
[57:33] that Moses said that you can't eat like
[57:37] that anymore
[57:39] yeah you can't do that anymore
[57:41] oh
[57:42] okay and another thing is you have to be
[57:45] circumcised what
[57:47] yeah
[57:49] well
[57:50] um okay and then another thing is you
[57:52] have to observe all of these feasts and
[57:54] all these festivals well okay because
[57:56] look right here it says it says in the
[57:58] law of Moses that you have to do these
[58:00] things Moses was a prophet am I right
[58:02] yes well then you have to do it
[58:05] and they start getting confused
[58:10] so then Paul
[58:13] he comes in he says what is going on
[58:16] what are you doing now you're causing
[58:18] all this Division and the church is all
[58:19] fighting with each other what are you
[58:21] doing
[58:23] and they said well do you not believe
[58:25] and Paul says yes I believe but you
[58:27] can't put that on them
[58:29] what are you thinking
[58:31] and the contention was so great
[58:34] between them
[58:36] that they had to send
[58:38] Paul
[58:40] and Barnabas back to Jerusalem
[58:44] to get an answer because there was so
[58:46] much doubt
[58:47] and what Paul was saying because of
[58:50] these two brothers that came in
[58:53] and caused all of this division
[58:56] let's turn to Acts chapter 15.
[59:03] now as you're turning
[59:07] Christianity
[59:09] in the very essence of Christianity
[59:13] it's
[59:14] it's a controversial
[59:17] subject it's an offensive subject
[59:20] Christianity is the message of Grace
[59:24] is offensive to many people it may not
[59:27] seem like it but it is because what the
[59:30] message of grace through Jesus Christ is
[59:33] telling all of us that you are not good
[59:36] enough
[59:37] to answer for your sins you can't do it
[59:40] you're not good enough every other
[59:42] religion in the world
[59:44] is a works-based religion
[59:48] which is Hinduism Buddhism Islam it's
[59:52] all you have to do this work and you
[59:55] will be rewarded which is the way that
[59:58] the human mind thinks but now this new
[1:00:01] religion comes in through Christ and
[1:00:02] says no you don't have to do anything
[1:00:04] all you have to do is accept Christ
[1:00:06] but then the Jews it's a works-based
[1:00:09] religion says you have to live according
[1:00:11] to the law
[1:00:12] so Christ comes and says no you don't
[1:00:16] so then there's all this confusion it's
[1:00:18] it's like well if we don't have to live
[1:00:21] by the law
[1:00:23] then what about just go wild and do all
[1:00:27] this and Paul's like no no no no no and
[1:00:28] I'm going to get to where Paul addresses
[1:00:30] all of that in the scriptures here
[1:00:33] so what he does
[1:00:36] is
[1:00:38] they go
[1:00:42] to Antioch they go to Jerusalem let's
[1:00:43] read acts 15 chapter Acts chapter 15
[1:00:46] verse 1.
[1:00:47] and here's what I'm talking about and
[1:00:50] certain men which came down from Judea
[1:00:53] taught the Brethren and said except you
[1:00:55] be circumcised after the manner of Moses
[1:00:59] you cannot be saved
[1:01:01] when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no
[1:01:03] small dissension and disputation with
[1:01:06] them they determined that Paul and
[1:01:07] Barnabas and certain other of them
[1:01:09] should go up to Jerusalem unto the
[1:01:11] apostles and Elders about this question
[1:01:14] now I asked brother Jordan and I talked
[1:01:16] about this after service but I asked
[1:01:19] the other night I said where would I
[1:01:21] have stood
[1:01:24] in this disputation
[1:01:26] would I have stood
[1:01:28] with the brothers who were teaching the
[1:01:30] prophet's message saying you have to be
[1:01:32] circumcised you have to eat this type of
[1:01:34] food you have to Worship in this way you
[1:01:36] have to observe this feasts I can read
[1:01:37] it right there would I have stood with
[1:01:38] him or would I have stood with this man
[1:01:40] named Paul
[1:01:43] who said no
[1:01:45] you don't have to do it
[1:01:47] where would I have stood
[1:01:50] Heath where would you stood
[1:01:52] and it's I hope I would be with Paul
[1:01:56] but boy that was a tough pill to swallow
[1:02:01] the difference
[1:02:03] is Paul by the inspiration of the Holy
[1:02:05] Ghost and the gift that God placed into
[1:02:07] his life understood why Abraham brought
[1:02:09] the Covenant of circumcision and why
[1:02:11] Moses brought the law he understood the
[1:02:13] end game he understood what it was for
[1:02:17] he couldn't they can't just see you you
[1:02:20] see the rules and regulations you see
[1:02:23] them and you stop right there but there
[1:02:25] is a reason for them Paul understood
[1:02:28] that
[1:02:29] a minister with a gift
[1:02:33] to explain the word
[1:02:35] otherwise you're just following a rule
[1:02:38] and it's doing you no good
[1:02:42] let's skip to verse seven in Acts 15.
[1:02:46] now this now they're in Jerusalem
[1:02:50] and there's this disputation
[1:02:53] between the preachers
[1:02:55] and basically Paul
[1:02:57] and Barnabas who had the revelation
[1:03:02] and when there had been much disputing
[1:03:04] Peter rose up
[1:03:06] and said unto them men and brethren
[1:03:09] you know how that a good while ago God
[1:03:11] made a choice Among Us that the Gentiles
[1:03:13] by my mouth should hear the word of the
[1:03:15] gospel and believe
[1:03:17] and God which knoweth the hearts bear
[1:03:19] them witness giving them the Holy Ghost
[1:03:22] even as he did unto us
[1:03:25] and put no difference between us and
[1:03:28] Them
[1:03:29] purifying their hearts by faith
[1:03:32] now therefore I love this
[1:03:36] now therefore why tempt ye God
[1:03:40] to put a yoke upon the neck of the
[1:03:43] disciples which neither our fathers nor
[1:03:45] we were able to bear
[1:03:51] Peter's saying that
[1:03:53] you know good and well your failures
[1:03:56] inside
[1:03:59] you know your heart you know where
[1:04:03] you've sinned you know where you haven't
[1:04:05] followed the law
[1:04:08] and you accept Christ
[1:04:11] and you're going to try to hammer this
[1:04:14] these legalism these doctrines upon them
[1:04:16] people and you couldn't even do it
[1:04:20] but we believe
[1:04:22] that through the grace of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:24] Christ we shall be saved even as they
[1:04:28] I love that Peter was saying that hey we
[1:04:31] believe that the grace of Christ saves
[1:04:33] us too
[1:04:36] not just the Gentiles
[1:04:38] but he lifts up the new Believers but
[1:04:41] Peter's doing he's lifting up these new
[1:04:43] Believers above the old-time believers
[1:04:48] then all the multitude kept silence
[1:04:51] and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul
[1:04:53] declaring What miracles and wonders God
[1:04:56] had wrought among the Gentiles
[1:04:59] and think about that
[1:05:03] and then it goes to verse 13 and says
[1:05:06] and after they had held their peace it
[1:05:08] wasn't recorded
[1:05:10] I wish I I wish I could have heard what
[1:05:12] they said
[1:05:13] I wish I could have heard Paul and
[1:05:15] barnabas's sermon right there that oh
[1:05:18] man
[1:05:19] but I'll talk to Paul in the future and
[1:05:22] I'm looking forward to him telling us
[1:05:24] what He preached on that day
[1:05:26] let's skip to verse 22.
[1:05:31] then it pleased the apostles and the
[1:05:32] elders with the whole church to send
[1:05:34] chosen men of their company to Antioch
[1:05:36] with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas
[1:05:39] surname bar sabbas and Silas Chief men
[1:05:41] among the Brethren so these two these
[1:05:43] two brothers from Jerusalem these two
[1:05:45] Jewish Brothers
[1:05:47] the Bible later calls Prophets
[1:05:49] and they wrote Letters by them after
[1:05:52] this manner so what happened is James
[1:05:55] who was the pastor at the church of
[1:05:57] Jerusalem
[1:05:59] he writes he and and they they can they
[1:06:02] conspire together and they write this
[1:06:05] letter
[1:06:06] to these Believers in galatia that are
[1:06:09] all torn apart because of all this
[1:06:10] legalism that's going around
[1:06:15] and the letter says this
[1:06:18] the apostles verse number 23 the
[1:06:21] apostles and the elders and the Brethren
[1:06:22] send greeting unto the Brethren which
[1:06:24] are of the Gentiles and Antioch and
[1:06:27] Syria and salicia
[1:06:32] for as much as we have heard
[1:06:34] that certain which went out from us have
[1:06:37] troubled you with words subverting your
[1:06:39] souls saying You must be circumcised and
[1:06:42] keep the law
[1:06:44] to whom we gave no such commandment
[1:06:48] so so these two brothers go out from
[1:06:51] Jerusalem and they're they're preaching
[1:06:53] this doctrine that you have to do this
[1:06:55] rule in this rule in this Rule and this
[1:06:56] Rule and these brothers the leaders the
[1:06:58] one the ones that were Jesus said wait
[1:07:00] wait we didn't send them
[1:07:02] another preaching the law of Moses
[1:07:04] brother Jonathan I'm not saying that
[1:07:06] they were preaching anything wrong
[1:07:08] but we didn't send them and let me tell
[1:07:11] you something neither did the Holy
[1:07:12] Spirit
[1:07:13] those brothers were going because of
[1:07:15] their own doctrines because of their own
[1:07:18] way of thinking trying to get somebody
[1:07:20] to convert to their own ways
[1:07:23] let me let me let you in on a little
[1:07:25] something that happened
[1:07:27] at the uh the Branham Tabernacle years
[1:07:30] ago
[1:07:32] 1965.
[1:07:34] brother Branham had the there was this
[1:07:38] same thing was going on
[1:07:40] in the Branham Tabernacle
[1:07:43] people were going out from the church
[1:07:45] and they were preaching these strange
[1:07:47] doctrines
[1:07:50] so brother Branham and the brothers they
[1:07:53] pin a letter
[1:07:55] this letter says this
[1:07:57] no person
[1:07:59] this is this is part of the letter
[1:08:02] there's more to this letter no person
[1:08:04] holding meetings selling books or tapes
[1:08:06] writing tracks giving out prayer cloths
[1:08:08] or cards of any kind or soliciting any
[1:08:10] gifts are not recognized by this church
[1:08:13] or its Pastor they are doing this under
[1:08:15] false pretense
[1:08:17] and have not been given the authority to
[1:08:19] do so
[1:08:20] the church does not send out any
[1:08:22] ministers other than it's Pastor
[1:08:23] Reverend William Branham to hold
[1:08:25] Services elsewhere the reason for these
[1:08:27] resolutions are as follows
[1:08:29] it has been brought to our attention
[1:08:31] that ministers are crossing the country
[1:08:32] entering into other fellowships saying
[1:08:35] that they are associated with and are
[1:08:37] sent out by this church to hold these
[1:08:40] meetings brother Branham says that is on
[1:08:43] the beginning
[1:08:44] of the God of this evil age 1965.
[1:08:49] so we see
[1:08:50] that this spirit is common
[1:08:54] its spirit is common not only it's
[1:08:57] common within within Christian ranks
[1:08:59] everywhere and you've heard brother
[1:09:01] Branham say things like
[1:09:04] say only what the tapes say
[1:09:09] we've all heard him say that why would
[1:09:11] he say that
[1:09:13] what purpose would God's servant have in
[1:09:17] saying something like that he says it
[1:09:20] because people are messing it up
[1:09:23] and they're preaching things that he
[1:09:26] didn't preach in his name
[1:09:28] representing him
[1:09:31] brother Branham says this he says in God
[1:09:33] hiding himself in Simplicity then really
[1:09:35] revealing himself in the same in the
[1:09:37] same 1963 the beginning of the Seven
[1:09:41] Seals brother Brown says this
[1:09:45] he says
[1:09:47] yeah so now listen every listen to every
[1:09:50] word catch it and if you're taking it on
[1:09:53] tapes or anything then you say you stay
[1:09:56] right with that tape teaching don't say
[1:09:58] nothing but what the tape says just say
[1:10:01] exactly what the tape says see now
[1:10:04] because some of these things we're going
[1:10:06] to understand a whole lot about this now
[1:10:09] why it's misunderstood he's speaking
[1:10:11] about the Seven Seals
[1:10:14] and you'll be sure to say just what the
[1:10:16] tape says don't say nothing else
[1:10:19] because I don't say that of my own it's
[1:10:20] him that says it you see and so many
[1:10:22] times confusion people raise up and say
[1:10:25] well so-and-so said it meant so and so
[1:10:28] just leave it the way it is
[1:10:31] I think that's one of the biggest
[1:10:33] problems
[1:10:35] is we have taken this message of brother
[1:10:38] Brandon and we have made it into
[1:10:40] something that he did not intend it to
[1:10:42] be
[1:10:43] we messed it up
[1:10:45] and it's become exactly what these
[1:10:48] Jewish Believers did they came in and
[1:10:51] said you got to do this and this and
[1:10:52] this and this and this and they had no
[1:10:53] revelation of what it was
[1:10:57] Paul
[1:10:59] comes in
[1:11:02] and says it differently
[1:11:04] let's continue on
[1:11:06] with this letter
[1:11:09] in the book of Acts it seemed good unto
[1:11:12] us
[1:11:12] being assembled with one Accord to send
[1:11:14] chosen men unto you with our beloved
[1:11:16] Barnabas and Paul
[1:11:17] men have Hazard their lives for the name
[1:11:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ we have sent
[1:11:22] therefore Judas and Silas
[1:11:25] who shall also teach you the same things
[1:11:27] by mouth I'm still in Acts 15 this is
[1:11:29] verse 28. for it seemed good to the Holy
[1:11:33] Ghost and us to lay upon you no greater
[1:11:37] burden than these Necessary Things
[1:11:41] there's like 600 Commandments
[1:11:44] in the Old Testament
[1:11:47] and I think there's more within the
[1:11:49] message
[1:11:56] do you hear what I said
[1:11:58] thanks
[1:12:02] that you abstain from Meats offered to
[1:12:05] idols
[1:12:07] and from blood and from things strangled
[1:12:10] and from fornication
[1:12:11] from which if you keep yourselves you
[1:12:14] shall do where well fare you well
[1:12:19] Meats offered Idols from blood from
[1:12:21] things strangled these things were
[1:12:24] extremely offensive
[1:12:27] to the Jewish people
[1:12:30] meets offered to idols and things
[1:12:32] strangled they would kill these things
[1:12:34] on on the altar of Baal or whatever it
[1:12:37] is and then they would take the meat and
[1:12:38] they would sell it in the market
[1:12:42] and then Paul
[1:12:45] basically says later on he says hey just
[1:12:47] don't eat that stuff in front of the
[1:12:49] Jews
[1:12:50] it was offensive
[1:12:52] to the Jewish people and from blood
[1:12:55] that's the very life a Jewish man a
[1:12:58] woman they couldn't eat anything that
[1:13:01] had the blood in it because that was the
[1:13:03] life it had to be bled out they it was
[1:13:05] it was offensive
[1:13:07] so look at the common respect here
[1:13:11] that these brothers from Jerusalem are
[1:13:14] teaching
[1:13:15] they're saying hey you legalists leave
[1:13:18] them alone
[1:13:20] and then over here with with the with
[1:13:23] the uh with the new Believers they're
[1:13:25] saying hey don't offend these longtime
[1:13:28] believers
[1:13:30] because it's important to them
[1:13:32] it's a mutual respect it's just it's
[1:13:35] beautiful
[1:13:39] so when they were dismissed
[1:13:45] let me let me go back and I forgot the
[1:13:48] one about fornication
[1:13:51] these people may not have been brought
[1:13:53] up right in their homes
[1:13:55] and then sleeping around with the young
[1:13:57] people and doing that he put that in
[1:14:00] there because that's going to destroy
[1:14:01] your life
[1:14:05] they may not have been
[1:14:07] it may not have been important to them
[1:14:09] but Paul but uh James and the Brethren
[1:14:12] are trying to protect them
[1:14:15] so when they were dismissed
[1:14:18] verse 30
[1:14:19] they came to Antioch
[1:14:21] and when they had gathered the multitude
[1:14:22] together they delivered the epistle
[1:14:24] which they had read and they rejoiced
[1:14:27] for the consolation
[1:14:30] now
[1:14:31] about this same time
[1:14:35] Paul in the book of Galatians doesn't
[1:14:39] make reference to this letter right here
[1:14:42] from the church of Jerusalem
[1:14:45] so I'm inclined to think maybe it was
[1:14:47] written Paul wrote Galatians just before
[1:14:50] maybe
[1:14:52] this letter from Jerusalem was penned
[1:14:56] maybe it was after but it is most
[1:14:59] certainly
[1:15:00] addressing the same thing
[1:15:05] so
[1:15:08] let's go to Galatians
[1:15:10] chapter 1.
[1:15:15] now remember
[1:15:16] Paul
[1:15:17] is addressing this legalism that was
[1:15:21] brought into the church
[1:15:24] and that's what this whole book this
[1:15:25] whole letter is about
[1:15:28] and you can feel a spirit
[1:15:33] as you read this letter from Paul
[1:15:36] you can feel it's it's a it's a spirit
[1:15:39] of frustration in Paul you can feel
[1:15:43] maybe there's anger in there because
[1:15:44] some of the things that he says
[1:15:47] he he says you foolish
[1:15:50] Galatians in one place
[1:15:53] he says have you so so soon forgot what
[1:15:56] I taught you
[1:15:57] you got mixed up in all this
[1:16:00] listen to this Paul an apostle
[1:16:04] not of men
[1:16:06] neither by man but by Jesus Christ and
[1:16:09] God the Father who raised him up from
[1:16:11] the dead I didn't come from any church I
[1:16:15] didn't come from any Seminary I came
[1:16:17] from God to give you this message
[1:16:20] he hits he hits it hard right away
[1:16:25] and all the Brethren which are with me
[1:16:26] under the churches of galatia Grace be
[1:16:29] to you and peace from God the father and
[1:16:31] from the Lord Jesus Christ who gave
[1:16:33] himself for our sins that he might
[1:16:36] Deliver Us from the present evil world
[1:16:38] according to the will of God and our
[1:16:41] father to whom be glory forever and ever
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:45] I Marvel
[1:16:48] that you are so soon removed from him
[1:16:51] that called you into the grace of Christ
[1:16:53] unto another gospel
[1:16:56] wow
[1:16:57] he gets right to business
[1:17:00] here
[1:17:02] I'm so I'm I'm Amazed
[1:17:06] that you're so you you so quickly leave
[1:17:09] what I've already taught you
[1:17:13] which is not another
[1:17:16] but there be some that trouble you
[1:17:18] these troublemakers
[1:17:21] and would pervert the gospel of Christ
[1:17:26] and as I said before the gospel in its
[1:17:29] nature the gospel of Christ in its
[1:17:32] nature is deeply offensive
[1:17:34] because it comes with unmerited Grace
[1:17:38] you don't have to do anything for this
[1:17:41] it's not like anything anyone had ever
[1:17:43] heard
[1:17:44] you can't do anything to earn your
[1:17:46] salvation
[1:17:50] and then we see
[1:17:52] we see these these these people these
[1:17:54] different churches and they get offended
[1:17:56] when someone else in the church
[1:18:00] has a different values than they have
[1:18:05] because they dress a certain way or act
[1:18:06] a certain way or have a certain type of
[1:18:08] song service or a certain type of
[1:18:10] minister
[1:18:13] it makes them inherently better than the
[1:18:15] person who doesn't hold them say these
[1:18:16] same values
[1:18:18] that does not line up with the gospel
[1:18:20] that does not line up with Grace
[1:18:24] legalism is in direct conflict
[1:18:28] with salvation through the blood of
[1:18:29] Christ direct conflict this is not a
[1:18:33] Works based religion
[1:18:35] you can't work your way to heaven
[1:18:40] don't don't start getting mad at me
[1:18:42] saying well brother Daniel doesn't
[1:18:43] believe in in works or does it doesn't
[1:18:46] believe doesn't believe in that I do
[1:18:47] believe in Holiness I do believe
[1:18:51] that we need to live a holy life and I'm
[1:18:55] going to show you why here in a little
[1:18:57] bit
[1:18:58] brother Brahm says this
[1:19:00] in Hebrews chapter 6 he says Grace
[1:19:03] is what God did for me
[1:19:06] works is what I do for God
[1:19:09] now they'll make a Doctrine this is this
[1:19:11] is quoting brother Brandon now they'll
[1:19:12] make a Doctrine out of it
[1:19:15] they think that works is what wins your
[1:19:17] merits
[1:19:18] if it is it isn't a free gift
[1:19:21] Grace is what God did for you but by
[1:19:24] Grace you are saved and works is what
[1:19:26] you do in appreciation for the grace
[1:19:28] that he has showed you and if you love
[1:19:31] him
[1:19:32] you like to do the works of the Lord
[1:19:37] now we get to verse 8 in Galatians
[1:19:42] chapter one but though we are an angel
[1:19:44] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[1:19:46] you then that's which we have preached
[1:19:48] unto you let him be accursed
[1:19:56] Paul says we
[1:19:58] don't forget
[1:19:59] there's Barnabas with him and these
[1:20:01] other brothers and you can see that they
[1:20:03] were in one Accord preaching the same
[1:20:05] message
[1:20:08] and it's not enough for Paul to say
[1:20:10] don't listen to these troublemakers
[1:20:13] he escalates it to let him be cursed
[1:20:19] something out if he says anything that's
[1:20:21] outside of this message of Grace that
[1:20:24] that we have preached that word curse is
[1:20:26] a strong word in in Greek it's anathema
[1:20:30] you are completely cut out you're gone
[1:20:33] you're cursed
[1:20:36] and as we said before so say I again now
[1:20:39] if any man preach any of the Gospel
[1:20:42] unto you than that which ye have
[1:20:44] received let him be accursed
[1:20:46] says it again
[1:20:50] for do I now persuade men or God
[1:20:52] I don't care what people think
[1:20:54] is what Paul's saying I could care I
[1:20:57] know I'm going to get persecuted for
[1:20:58] this Paul's saying I know this doesn't
[1:21:00] line up with all of the the dogmas that
[1:21:04] that are you're being taught
[1:21:06] or do I seek to please men
[1:21:09] for if I yet please men I should not be
[1:21:11] I should not be the servant of Christ
[1:21:18] this Curt this curse is prevalent
[1:21:21] friends in the churches
[1:21:23] ministers will preach Doctrine not
[1:21:25] because they are receiving a certain
[1:21:26] sermon from the Lord
[1:21:29] but because it fits the church doctrine
[1:21:31] it fits the message narrative that's why
[1:21:34] they preach it
[1:21:35] everybody says amen yay you know keep
[1:21:38] keep it coming it's it's lining up
[1:21:40] perfectly with what I think
[1:21:42] it's not what Paul said
[1:21:44] Paul said do I please men or do I please
[1:21:46] God
[1:21:54] let's go to Galatians chapter 2.
[1:21:57] let's start with with verse 3.
[1:22:00] now again he's addressing the
[1:22:02] circumcision thing he says but neither
[1:22:04] Titus who was with me being a Greek was
[1:22:07] compelled to be circumcised
[1:22:09] and because of false Doctrine unawares
[1:22:12] brought in who came in privily to spy
[1:22:15] out our Liberty
[1:22:16] which we have in Christ Jesus that they
[1:22:19] might bring us into bondage
[1:22:25] remember who he's talking about
[1:22:32] so these men in galatia probably an
[1:22:34] Antioch in particular they brought this
[1:22:36] Doctrine and Paul is saying listen
[1:22:38] that's bringing you into slavery
[1:22:41] slavery to who slavery to them
[1:22:44] slavery to what that pastor says
[1:22:47] slavery to what the group says
[1:22:53] and and I I think that we need to be
[1:22:55] careful I'm not against listening
[1:22:59] to other ministers and other churches I
[1:23:01] do I enjoy it it's a blessing to me but
[1:23:03] we have to be careful about outside
[1:23:05] Church influences influencing us
[1:23:10] and how we think
[1:23:12] we are a sovereign body
[1:23:16] we are operating independently just like
[1:23:18] the church in Antioch
[1:23:20] and we elect our own boards we elect our
[1:23:23] own pastor
[1:23:24] and we should be operating as I said
[1:23:26] independently but collectively with
[1:23:29] other believers
[1:23:30] in other parts of the country loving one
[1:23:33] another working together but no you do
[1:23:35] not dictate what is said in this church
[1:23:37] or the doctrine said in this church the
[1:23:40] Holy Spirit deals directly with us
[1:23:45] let's skip to verse 12. now this is
[1:23:47] Peter
[1:23:49] Paul or Paul here in the book of
[1:23:50] Galatians he's he's addressing something
[1:23:52] that happened with Peter he said for
[1:23:54] before that a certain came from James
[1:23:58] before these guys came
[1:24:00] from Jerusalem
[1:24:02] Peter ate with the Gentiles but when
[1:24:04] they were come he withdrew himself and
[1:24:06] separated himself fearing them which
[1:24:08] were of the circumcision circumcision
[1:24:11] he was afraid
[1:24:13] he was afraid that as a minister Buddies
[1:24:16] might say something against him
[1:24:20] he was afraid of going against the grain
[1:24:23] and the other Jews dissembled likewise
[1:24:26] with him in so much that Barnabas also
[1:24:28] was carried away with their
[1:24:29] dissimilation
[1:24:30] look at the influence of this good man
[1:24:32] Even Adam Barnabas
[1:24:37] but when they but when I saw that they
[1:24:40] walked not uprightly according to the
[1:24:41] truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter
[1:24:43] before the before all of them if thou
[1:24:46] being a Jew lives after the manner of
[1:24:48] the Gentiles and not as the Jews do why
[1:24:50] compel us thou the Gentiles to live
[1:24:52] after the Jews
[1:24:54] for who are the Jews
[1:24:56] by nature and not sinners
[1:25:00] of the Gentiles
[1:25:03] so he's saying here hey for you
[1:25:06] legalists that have lived this way don't
[1:25:08] stop living that way
[1:25:12] but also don't forget that you're just
[1:25:14] as bad of a sinner as anyone else
[1:25:17] knowing that a man is not justified by
[1:25:20] The Works of the law but by the faith of
[1:25:22] Jesus Christ
[1:25:24] amen
[1:25:25] even we have believed in Jesus Christ
[1:25:27] that we might be justified by Faith by
[1:25:30] the Faith of Christ and not by The Works
[1:25:33] of the law for by The Works of the law
[1:25:35] shall no flesh be justified
[1:25:40] do you realize how offensive that was
[1:25:43] to the Jewish people
[1:25:45] do you realize what
[1:25:48] what an offense this gospel is he's
[1:25:50] saying oh yeah you keep the law that
[1:25:52] that's been going on for 1500 years you
[1:25:55] believe this and and and you live your
[1:25:58] life like this according to all these
[1:25:59] Commandments oh by the way you can't be
[1:26:02] saved for doing that a direct conflict
[1:26:06] of what they thought
[1:26:07] they thought this is how I get to heaven
[1:26:10] is by doing all of these Works Paul's
[1:26:12] like no
[1:26:14] because you failed and you know you
[1:26:16] failed every one of us has failed
[1:26:18] but it's by Grace this is a message of
[1:26:21] Grace that Paul is preaching
[1:26:26] you know and
[1:26:29] let me read that again
[1:26:31] for by The Works of the law shall no
[1:26:34] flesh be justified
[1:26:36] so then I've heard
[1:26:40] people say
[1:26:43] I've had this conversation
[1:26:45] about all of our our so-called message
[1:26:48] dogma and all this
[1:26:50] well then why don't why don't I just
[1:26:51] throw it all out and why don't I just
[1:26:54] start going having beers with my buddies
[1:26:56] I'm wondering with it with the sisters
[1:26:58] why don't I just dress like like to
[1:27:00] attract men in the wrong way
[1:27:03] put myself out there why don't I just do
[1:27:06] that
[1:27:07] or for the brothers why don't I just
[1:27:11] hit the clubs
[1:27:13] partying drinking all of that ask you
[1:27:17] let's say free all to do that what
[1:27:21] spirit
[1:27:22] would be inside of you that would want
[1:27:25] to do that
[1:27:28] let me tell you something just following
[1:27:30] rules ain't gonna do you any good if you
[1:27:32] have that spirit
[1:27:40] now for the for the older folks well
[1:27:42] brother Daniel if you if you're what's
[1:27:44] saying if what you're saying is right
[1:27:45] brother Daniel or brother Paul
[1:27:48] if what you're saying is right
[1:27:51] then what do I even worry about praying
[1:27:54] why can't I just sit around watch TV all
[1:27:56] day for the older ones why can why do I
[1:27:58] have to worry about praying why do I
[1:27:59] have to worry about reading my Bible why
[1:28:01] do I have to do do this I'm saved
[1:28:04] anyways by grace
[1:28:06] what is inside you that wants to do that
[1:28:10] it's the core that's the problem it's
[1:28:13] not a bunch of rules that's doing you
[1:28:14] any good
[1:28:19] but if we but if verse 17.
[1:28:23] but if while we seek to be justified by
[1:28:25] Christ we ourselves are found Sinners is
[1:28:29] therefore Christ the minister of sin
[1:28:32] God forbid
[1:28:36] so if you get rid of all the rules and
[1:28:37] all the legalism and all of that which
[1:28:39] we should then how are you going to live
[1:28:40] your life
[1:28:41] what's going to be guiding you
[1:28:44] there's something that has to guide us
[1:28:48] for if I build again the things which I
[1:28:51] destroyed I make myself a transgressor
[1:28:53] Paul's addressing he's like
[1:28:56] I I I brought this message to you
[1:29:01] and I'm not going to tear it down
[1:29:05] for though for I I through the law am
[1:29:08] dead to the law for I through the law am
[1:29:11] dead to the law that I might live unto
[1:29:14] God
[1:29:16] I am crucified with Christ nevertheless
[1:29:18] I live not yet I
[1:29:21] I love this this is it
[1:29:27] for through the law I'm dead to the law
[1:29:28] that I might live unto God I am
[1:29:30] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:29:33] live
[1:29:34] yet not I
[1:29:36] but Christ liveth in me and the life
[1:29:39] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[1:29:42] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[1:29:45] and gave himself for me
[1:29:50] I do not frustrate the grace of God for
[1:29:53] if righteousness come by the law then
[1:29:56] Christ is dead in vain
[1:30:00] so we see Paul here he's addressing this
[1:30:03] with this letter to the Galatians
[1:30:10] countering that Doctrine
[1:30:13] he's saying in verse 18
[1:30:16] that I already preached against this
[1:30:18] against this legalistic Doctrine and if
[1:30:20] I go back to what I said then I make
[1:30:22] myself a transgressor for if I build the
[1:30:25] things which I destroyed I make myself a
[1:30:28] transgressor
[1:30:38] I've said before
[1:30:40] that the greatest witness that we have
[1:30:44] as a body is our Unity is our love for
[1:30:48] one another Jesus Christ prayed that
[1:30:52] and I see
[1:30:54] here Paul is saying in verse 20. I am
[1:30:57] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:31:00] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:31:03] and the life which I now live in the
[1:31:06] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:31:09] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:31:15] I do not frustrate the grace of God
[1:31:18] first righteousness come by the law then
[1:31:20] Christ is dead in vain you cannot work
[1:31:24] your way to heaven
[1:31:27] it says it over and over and over and
[1:31:28] over you can't do it
[1:31:31] let's go to Galatians 3.
[1:31:36] let's go to verse 26.
[1:31:40] verse 25.
[1:31:42] for after that faith has come we are no
[1:31:45] longer under a school master
[1:31:47] for a year all the children of God by
[1:31:50] faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you
[1:31:53] as have been baptized into Christ have
[1:31:56] put on Christ
[1:31:59] there is neither Juno Greek there is
[1:32:01] neither Bond nor free there is neither
[1:32:03] male nor female for you are all one in
[1:32:06] Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then
[1:32:08] you are Abraham's seed and according to
[1:32:11] the promise
[1:32:13] do you understand that
[1:32:15] Abraham what's that song it says
[1:32:18] Father Abraham had many sons many sons
[1:32:20] had Father Abraham you know that's I
[1:32:22] learn it when you're a kid you know what
[1:32:24] that means
[1:32:26] it doesn't mean that we're sons of
[1:32:29] Abraham or that we're even his
[1:32:31] descendants
[1:32:32] you know that
[1:32:34] you know if we want to check our
[1:32:35] genealogy or whatever you know they do
[1:32:37] the the thing and and you want to trace
[1:32:39] it all the way back you might not have
[1:32:42] the DNA of Abraham but it doesn't matter
[1:32:50] right brother Aaron
[1:32:52] if ye be Christ's then you are Abraham's
[1:32:56] seed and according to the promise so
[1:33:00] then we can say I am a son of Abraham I
[1:33:03] am of that faith I am of that Covenant
[1:33:06] because I accept Christ
[1:33:08] in another place it says that it's
[1:33:11] speaking of one and that's Christ that's
[1:33:13] Jesus is the son of Abraham and if we be
[1:33:16] his sons
[1:33:18] then we are Abraham's sons
[1:33:22] let's skip
[1:33:24] to chapter five
[1:33:29] Paul
[1:33:31] that brother is I think the best writer
[1:33:35] that has ever walked the Earth that has
[1:33:38] ever picked up a pen
[1:33:39] some of the things that he says
[1:33:42] wow they're so inspiring chapter 5 verse
[1:33:46] 1.
[1:33:49] oh wait till the brothers get it up
[1:33:51] there yeah listen to this Stand Fast
[1:33:54] therefore in the Liberty where with
[1:33:56] Christ has made us free and be not
[1:33:58] entangled again with the Yoke of bondage
[1:34:02] speaking of that legalistic Jewish rule
[1:34:04] behold I Paul say unto you that if you
[1:34:06] be circumcised Christ shall profit you
[1:34:09] nothing
[1:34:10] for I testify again that every man that
[1:34:13] is circumcised that he is a debtor to do
[1:34:16] the whole law
[1:34:19] so he's obligated
[1:34:22] if he's saying that I believe this
[1:34:25] message every word which of course they
[1:34:28] do believe but please understand what
[1:34:29] I'm saying don't say that I don't
[1:34:32] believe or that I'm trying to get us to
[1:34:35] come away from what the prophet taught
[1:34:37] I'm not and Paul said the same thing
[1:34:40] don't think that I'm trying to pull back
[1:34:43] from what Moses said
[1:34:45] but he says
[1:34:47] that I testify to every man that has
[1:34:50] circumcised that he is a debtor to do
[1:34:52] the whole law he is obligated to keep
[1:34:54] the whole law
[1:34:57] to do it all
[1:35:00] let me read a quote to you my brother
[1:35:02] Branham said
[1:35:06] he said this
[1:35:08] in
[1:35:13] for the Jordan if we could do Christ
[1:35:15] is revealed in his own word
[1:35:18] that's what's the matter with our
[1:35:21] country today
[1:35:22] the reason we got so many loose leaf
[1:35:25] things in the Earth today the penalties
[1:35:27] are not strong enough
[1:35:29] if a man was caught running out with
[1:35:31] another man's wife they should both be
[1:35:33] taken out in public and castrated right
[1:35:35] in public and turn loose that's right if
[1:35:37] a man is caught doing anything wrong
[1:35:39] down the road speeding
[1:35:45] he ought to be given less than 10 years
[1:35:49] his premeditated murder you see you put
[1:35:53] penalties like that on
[1:35:56] you'll slow them down
[1:36:00] you read that no brother Dan I'm not I'm
[1:36:02] not a legalist
[1:36:04] well I believe in this this and this and
[1:36:05] this but I don't think I'm going to
[1:36:06] believe that part
[1:36:09] I think I'll throw that out we have no
[1:36:12] right
[1:36:13] Paul is saying right here if you're
[1:36:15] going to do it if you're going to live
[1:36:16] this life live it all
[1:36:18] and the same thing right here was
[1:36:20] something as simple as speeding 10 years
[1:36:24] I don't see why we don't have all the
[1:36:25] message Believers putting along
[1:36:30] at the speed limit
[1:36:33] are you gonna do it or not
[1:36:36] brother Brown said this and that uh that
[1:36:38] quote brother Jordan I don't know if you
[1:36:39] put it up there I asked you to print but
[1:36:41] I don't think I gave it to him it says
[1:36:43] this
[1:36:44] and influences 1964 it says I think that
[1:36:48] it behooves us
[1:36:50] tonight to think about that for every
[1:36:53] man woman boy or girl that knows you're
[1:36:56] coming to the judgment
[1:36:57] you might escape this or that or the
[1:37:00] other you might beat the income tax you
[1:37:02] might escape the eternal revenue you
[1:37:04] might do one thing or another you might
[1:37:06] have to run you might have run over the
[1:37:09] speed limit and the cops never catch you
[1:37:11] but one day judgment is going to catch
[1:37:14] you
[1:37:15] that's certain
[1:37:16] speaking of speeding
[1:37:19] but we just throw that part out
[1:37:22] because of Grace we want Grace when it
[1:37:24] doesn't line up with our Doctrine or
[1:37:26] that we don't want to do it
[1:37:28] and I'm not
[1:37:30] telling you how to drive I'm trying to
[1:37:32] make a point
[1:37:36] another one
[1:37:38] brother Branham said
[1:37:41] you shouldn't never
[1:37:43] miss church
[1:37:47] brother I don't it's Grace
[1:37:51] wait a minute he said you shouldn't miss
[1:37:54] church
[1:37:55] but yet we're going to try to pound this
[1:37:58] other stuff on everybody
[1:38:04] brother Brown said for no reason
[1:38:07] oh I sent that one to you
[1:38:10] I'll read it
[1:38:11] now if you have to miss work to hear to
[1:38:15] be with us and pray with us and so forth
[1:38:17] you have to miss work that's right go
[1:38:19] ahead and miss work but don't you miss
[1:38:20] church
[1:38:22] don't you miss church
[1:38:25] I won't make you late enough to miss
[1:38:26] church but if you do have to miss work
[1:38:29] once in a while that won't hurt because
[1:38:31] because work that's just your daily
[1:38:33] bread
[1:38:34] and you the Lord promised to provide
[1:38:36] that but this you must really be sure to
[1:38:39] come to church
[1:38:44] I'm trying
[1:38:46] to make a point if you're going to try
[1:38:50] to live this legalistic lifestyle do
[1:38:53] everything don't miss anything but let
[1:38:56] me tell you something you'll fail
[1:38:58] and if you if you're counting on that
[1:39:00] you'll go to hell
[1:39:02] there is Grace that is there
[1:39:07] skip to uh
[1:39:09] let's skip to verse 13 in chapter 5.
[1:39:13] for Brethren you have been called unto
[1:39:15] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[1:39:18] occasion do the flesh
[1:39:20] but by love serve one another
[1:39:23] now listen to this you talk about Grace
[1:39:26] we're talking about Grace versus the law
[1:39:31] listen to this
[1:39:32] for the law is fulfilled in one word now
[1:39:34] Paul's going back and saying No Moses is
[1:39:37] writing he's he's the he's writing the
[1:39:39] truth
[1:39:41] for the law is fulfilled in one word
[1:39:44] even this Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:39:46] as thyself
[1:39:49] here he's showing the difference that if
[1:39:51] you really receive Christ and you
[1:39:54] understand that you are saved by grace
[1:39:58] you will receive a new love
[1:40:02] but if you bite and devour one another
[1:40:04] take heed that you be not consumed one
[1:40:07] of another
[1:40:09] this I say walk in the spirit and ye
[1:40:12] shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:40:13] for the flesh lusts against the spirit
[1:40:16] and the spirit against the Flesh and
[1:40:17] these are contrary the one to another so
[1:40:20] that you cannot do the things that you
[1:40:23] would
[1:40:24] now we have two Natures here at Battle
[1:40:26] we have the nature of the old Daniel
[1:40:28] Evans
[1:40:29] The Sinner
[1:40:31] and then we have the nature of the new
[1:40:34] Daniel Evans
[1:40:36] that has the Holy Spirit the old Daniel
[1:40:40] Evans there it's Disobedience it's
[1:40:43] rebellious
[1:40:47] and then we have the new and look what
[1:40:49] these Spirits produce
[1:40:52] but if ye be led of the spirit
[1:40:55] then you are not under the law
[1:40:57] for the works of the flesh are
[1:40:59] manifested which are these adultery
[1:41:00] fornication uncleanliness lasciviousness
[1:41:03] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[1:41:06] Emulsion emulations wrath Strife
[1:41:09] seditions heresies envyings murders
[1:41:12] drunkenness revelings and such the like
[1:41:14] all of that garbage
[1:41:19] of the which I tell you before as I have
[1:41:22] also told you in times past they which
[1:41:24] do those things shall not inherit
[1:41:26] inherit the kingdom of God
[1:41:28] wow so Paul is here he says Grace Grace
[1:41:31] Grace
[1:41:32] but why are you sinning
[1:41:37] why would you why would you do these
[1:41:39] evil things
[1:41:41] and what he's saying
[1:41:42] is that there is a new birth
[1:41:45] there's a change that comes upon that
[1:41:49] Christian and it goes from a set of
[1:41:51] rules that's always pointing fingers and
[1:41:54] condemning everybody else to now there
[1:41:57] is Grace there and there is that love
[1:41:59] and now it's it's you don't have to have
[1:42:02] a set of rules because those rules are
[1:42:04] like
[1:42:05] Jesus standing right here
[1:42:08] and you know what if it doesn't fit in
[1:42:09] the rules am I going to do it whoa
[1:42:12] Jesus Christ is standing right there
[1:42:14] seeing everything that I do you know
[1:42:15] what he's closer than standing there
[1:42:17] he's inside
[1:42:18] over here
[1:42:20] and he's condemning me if I go and I
[1:42:23] tell a lie or I say something against a
[1:42:25] brother or a sister that Holy Spirit
[1:42:27] Within Me is the law and it says you're
[1:42:29] wrong don't do that
[1:42:32] and I can say I can take well let me see
[1:42:35] here the 600
[1:42:37] nope it's not there I can do it
[1:42:40] no you can't
[1:42:42] I don't care if it's not written in the
[1:42:44] law
[1:42:45] the Holy Spirit within you
[1:42:48] brings this Holiness the Holy Spirit
[1:42:50] within you makes these decisions I
[1:42:52] remember my uh
[1:42:55] being a dad
[1:42:57] with daughter with a daughter
[1:43:01] and my my daughter
[1:43:03] would come and and with her clothes and
[1:43:06] whatever and and I'd say sweetheart now
[1:43:11] um why don't you not wear that
[1:43:13] but daddy is below my knees
[1:43:17] I mean I don't care if it's below your
[1:43:19] knees you don't
[1:43:21] no
[1:43:22] it doesn't matter to me one bit if it's
[1:43:24] below your knees it doesn't no I don't
[1:43:27] care
[1:43:28] the Holy Spirit within dad says no you
[1:43:30] can't wear that I don't care if it meets
[1:43:32] the rules
[1:43:34] and these sins friends this legalism
[1:43:37] that we have you know what it does it it
[1:43:39] introduces sin into our lives
[1:43:42] because there's always a way to get out
[1:43:43] of the rules
[1:43:46] but that Holy Spirit that was was is
[1:43:48] within us we don't want to get away from
[1:43:50] him
[1:43:51] we don't want to deceive him we don't
[1:43:52] want to break his rules or his laws that
[1:43:55] Holy Spirit dictates what we say and
[1:43:58] what we do
[1:44:00] in closing Galatians chapter 6.
[1:44:04] brethren
[1:44:06] if a man be overtaken in a fault listen
[1:44:09] to Grace
[1:44:10] listen to Grace here how quick we are to
[1:44:14] condemn each other
[1:44:16] Brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[1:44:18] fault
[1:44:20] remember the holy spirit said now it's
[1:44:23] replaced the law
[1:44:25] ye which are spiritual
[1:44:28] you that have the Holy Spirit you that
[1:44:31] understand this gospel you which are
[1:44:34] spiritual restores such a one in the
[1:44:37] spirit of meekness considering thyself
[1:44:39] lest thou also be tempted
[1:44:42] you're no better than anybody else
[1:44:47] Grace legalism condemns and points the
[1:44:51] finger says look at him look at her look
[1:44:54] at that look at this look at look at all
[1:44:56] the other clothes and look at what he
[1:44:58] does when he's off legalism points the
[1:45:00] finger Grace says I'm a sinner too
[1:45:04] come to the Lord Jesus
[1:45:06] come to him he'll forgive both of us I'm
[1:45:10] no better than you are
[1:45:12] how many people from all these churches
[1:45:16] how many people were hurt over the years
[1:45:19] and left because they got offended
[1:45:21] because they were treated wrong
[1:45:24] how many people did how many people were
[1:45:26] gone
[1:45:27] because we cut them out through legalism
[1:45:31] a lot of good that did for the body of
[1:45:34] Christ
[1:45:35] Paul here says you bring them back
[1:45:39] Barrel ye one another's burdens and so
[1:45:42] fulfill the law of Christ
[1:45:45] Paul sums it up right there
[1:45:48] Christ bore our burdens
[1:45:50] and if we're calling ourselves
[1:45:52] Christians and we'll bear each other's
[1:45:53] burdens
[1:45:54] skip to verse 13.
[1:45:57] for neither they themselves who are
[1:45:59] circumcised keep the law but desire to
[1:46:02] have you circumcised that they may glory
[1:46:04] in your flesh
[1:46:07] I wish I had time to go into this how
[1:46:11] many of us witness to people and how
[1:46:13] many of us want to lead someone to the
[1:46:15] Lord and want to and want to get them to
[1:46:17] come to church just because we want them
[1:46:19] to be like us
[1:46:21] we want a trophy that says oh I let her
[1:46:23] I let her to the Lord no it never works
[1:46:28] you get them to Christ and then that
[1:46:31] same Christ that's in you will be in
[1:46:33] them and then that soul is saved
[1:46:37] you want to get them to you want to get
[1:46:38] them to church so you can say I'll let
[1:46:40] this person the Lord that doesn't work
[1:46:43] that's why we see very few converts
[1:46:46] today
[1:46:47] it's because our hearts aren't right
[1:46:51] but God forbid that I should Glory save
[1:46:54] in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:46:56] whom the world is crucified unto me and
[1:46:59] I unto the world
[1:47:03] for in Christ Jesus if the musicians
[1:47:06] would come
[1:47:07] for in Christ Jesus
[1:47:09] neither circumcision availeth anything
[1:47:12] nor uncircumcision
[1:47:15] but
[1:47:17] a new creature
[1:47:20] but a new born again believer but a
[1:47:25] changed soul
[1:47:29] this is the climax of this whole letter
[1:47:31] to the Galatians this is his this is his

[1:48:09] for henceforth let no man trouble me
[1:48:12] for I bear in my body the marks of the
[1:48:14] Lord Jesus
[1:48:16] Paul God bless his heart I cannot wait
[1:48:20] to meet that man
[1:48:22] Paul says here he says oh you're talking
[1:48:25] about circumcision you know when you're
[1:48:26] eight days old take a knife and and do
[1:48:29] this
[1:48:30] let me tell you about the marks that are
[1:48:32] on my body
[1:48:34] he could take off his shirt and see
[1:48:36] those stripes
[1:48:37] that he was beaten for this message
[1:48:42] he could you could look at his face and
[1:48:44] see where he was stoned at lystra until
[1:48:46] he was dead with rocks I guarantee you
[1:48:48] there were scars all over him
[1:48:51] bosses
[1:48:52] circumcision let me show you what the
[1:48:55] marks of Jesus Christ are let me show
[1:48:58] you what the marks of God are
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:05] you close this
[1:49:07] brethren
[1:49:10] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
[1:49:14] with your spirit
[1:49:15] amen
[1:49:21] so why am I
[1:49:23] preaching this
[1:49:26] I'm not preaching anything new it's
[1:49:27] already it was preached 2000 years ago
[1:49:30] why am I saying this I'm saying this
[1:49:33] because these doctrines that we've
[1:49:35] developed over the years
[1:49:38] they're the doctrines of men
[1:49:41] I'm saying the same thing that our
[1:49:43] brother is saying here
[1:49:46] and when we do that we discount the new
[1:49:49] birth
[1:49:50] we discount the Holy Ghost and we
[1:49:53] replace it with a bunch of rules do I
[1:49:55] say that oh it's okay to live worldly no
[1:49:59] the opposite
[1:50:01] if you truly receive this Holy Spirit
[1:50:05] you will live like Christ lived
[1:50:09] and it's far better than a bunch of
[1:50:11] rules and regulations
[1:50:14] you'll live like Jesus Christ
[1:50:18] for you young people
[1:50:20] kids I want to tell you something how
[1:50:21] you make a decision
[1:50:22] all right do I have your attention Bella
[1:50:25] you with me
[1:50:27] here's how you make every decision
[1:50:30] Olivia got your attention
[1:50:33] whatever you do the Bible says whatever
[1:50:37] you do in word or deed
[1:50:40] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:43] so when you make a decision
[1:50:46] if you decide to go out with this boy or
[1:50:49] you decide to go out with this girl or
[1:50:51] you were trying to figure out where to
[1:50:53] where to take them or you're trying to
[1:50:55] figure out where to go to school you're
[1:50:56] trying to figure out all these things
[1:50:57] ask
[1:51:00] with the Lord Jesus do this
[1:51:03] with the Lord Jesus approve of what I'm
[1:51:05] doing
[1:51:06] and if he would then do it
[1:51:08] if he would not then don't do it
[1:51:12] that's called the Holy Spirit operating
[1:51:16] but if we try to set the law
[1:51:22] like these brothers when they came from
[1:51:24] Jerusalem
[1:51:25] it causes division
[1:51:28] and friends this church has experienced
[1:51:32] that just like every other Church
[1:51:35] I'm talking about historically this one
[1:51:38] people have left because they've been
[1:51:40] hurt
[1:51:42] because fingers have been pointed at
[1:51:44] them
[1:51:46] but you see Christ his arms are open bro
[1:51:50] his arms are open
[1:51:52] come
[1:51:54] come to a place that loves you
[1:51:58] and then we introduce them to the Lord
[1:52:02] like I do with my kids
[1:52:04] introduce them to the Lord Jesus and
[1:52:07] then he governs their life
[1:52:10] and then the holy spirit is operating
[1:52:13] then Lord I've accomplished my task
[1:52:17] I've been there
[1:52:21] and that's what this pulpit
[1:52:25] foreign
[1:52:28] to me as long as it pleases the Lord and
[1:52:32] his people for me to be here
[1:52:34] you're going to hear about Jesus
[1:52:37] I I see so many people they say well
[1:52:42] well if we just preach Jesus
[1:52:45] then what separates us from all these
[1:52:47] other people
[1:52:49] why do you want to be separated
[1:52:51] you see Christ up there
[1:52:53] you see God the Father up there looking
[1:52:56] down upon his children and says yeah I
[1:52:59] like it when they separate
[1:53:02] are you are you saying this saying that
[1:53:04] well we're the only ones that are saved
[1:53:06] we're the only ones that really belong
[1:53:07] to Jesus no you're not
[1:53:10] we come to Christ and that is our Common
[1:53:13] Ground
[1:53:15] yeah of course we know more we we've
[1:53:19] been given
[1:53:21] as as maybe the Disciples of Paul
[1:53:24] we've been given more so we have more to
[1:53:27] be responsible for
[1:53:29] but it's the same Christ
[1:53:33] we can live a life that that is pleasing
[1:53:37] to the Lord we can
[1:53:41] and this other person that's that's
[1:53:43] living a life that we might judge him
[1:53:45] and say that's not pleasing Lord you're
[1:53:46] doing this this and this and this the
[1:53:48] same blood of Jesus Christ covers both
[1:53:51] if they would accept Christ we're going
[1:53:52] to end up in the same place
[1:53:54] nobody's any better than any other you
[1:53:57] cannot work your way to heaven even
[1:54:01] though we want to we want to say I'm
[1:54:03] going to give up this I'm going to give
[1:54:05] up that I'm going to stop
[1:54:08] doing all these things remember I've
[1:54:10] preached this before
[1:54:13] it is not
[1:54:15] what you don't do for God
[1:54:18] that pleases him
[1:54:19] it's what you do for him
[1:54:22] you be up and doing you be active in
[1:54:25] these things
[1:54:27] and I
[1:54:28] I see families friends and uh just
[1:54:32] before we close it's just I feel it on
[1:54:35] my heart
[1:54:36] that there's families here that maybe
[1:54:42] the husband
[1:54:45] doesn't see
[1:54:46] the things that the wife sees or maybe
[1:54:49] maybe the the husband sees things that
[1:54:52] maybe the wife doesn't see and we see
[1:54:55] friction
[1:54:56] between the family
[1:54:58] with children
[1:55:00] we see maybe we say well my child
[1:55:03] doesn't doesn't believe or or he's not
[1:55:05] he's not a real believer don't ever say
[1:55:07] that
[1:55:10] when that friction is there let me ask
[1:55:13] every one of you
[1:55:15] every one of your parents every one of
[1:55:17] you had been on the earth a little while
[1:55:21] does preaching to someone
[1:55:23] does telling them that you need to do
[1:55:25] this this and this and this how has that
[1:55:27] worked out for you
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:30] has it been successful no
[1:55:32] it never will
[1:55:34] you know what's successful is what Paul
[1:55:36] said let me sum it up and one thing is
[1:55:38] Paul said love one another
[1:55:42] that's when you will win someone
[1:55:45] is you be that love you be that Jesus
[1:55:49] Christ not pointing your finger not
[1:55:52] being the legalist like these brothers
[1:55:53] came but you be the Paul
[1:55:56] that loved
[1:55:58] that lived a life probably better than
[1:56:01] anyone at his time
[1:56:02] but he didn't say that
[1:56:04] he loved
[1:56:07] you brothers that want a Godly wife
[1:56:11] be a Godly husband to her
[1:56:14] you sisters
[1:56:16] I want a Godly husband be a Godly wife
[1:56:19] I'm always condemning each other the
[1:56:22] condemnation doesn't work
[1:56:25] are we together
[1:56:29] legalism
[1:56:31] is something that destroys Fellowship
[1:56:36] it separates us and it needs to stop
[1:56:41] if you see someone that isn't living
[1:56:43] like you think they should live
[1:56:46] get on your knees and quit pointing a
[1:56:49] finger
[1:56:50] because when you point a finger guess
[1:56:52] what
[1:56:53] you're according to this book
[1:56:56] you're condemned
[1:56:58] [Music]
[1:57:00] really one more thing who was The Sinner
[1:57:04] when Jesus was here who was the dirty
[1:57:07] filthy sinner when Christ was here was
[1:57:11] it the prostitute mentally ill Mary
[1:57:14] Magdalene
[1:57:16] the filthy sinner who was it
[1:57:19] was it Mary of Bethany the one that had
[1:57:22] slept around and done all that she had
[1:57:23] done
[1:57:24] was it her was it the woman at the well
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:29] that was that that she lived immorally
[1:57:33] was it the woman that was caught in
[1:57:35] adultery in the very Act of it that was
[1:57:37] about to be stoned was it her was it
[1:57:39] Matthew the lying cheat that cheated his
[1:57:42] own people was it him who was the dirty
[1:57:44] sinner or was it the Pharisee
[1:57:48] the preacher in the Pulpit saying
[1:57:50] condemning all of these people for not
[1:57:52] living a life who when Jesus was here
[1:57:55] who was the filthy one
[1:57:57] [Music]
[1:57:58] there was there was a group over here
[1:58:00] that I just mentioned
[1:58:02] that a soft tender heart
[1:58:04] that were willing to give their hearts
[1:58:06] to the Lord
[1:58:07] and then there was another one
[1:58:09] even though he lived that law
[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:13] he wasn't
[1:58:15] he was full of condemnation who was the
[1:58:18] filthy one
[1:58:20] it was the one
[1:58:21] Pharisee the sadducee and the pulpit
[1:58:24] that was condemning
[1:58:26] and he's the one that crucified Jesus
[1:58:31] Amendment stand
