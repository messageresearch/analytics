[34:59] 24 if you could keep playing sister Lily
[35:02] thank you Joshua chapter 24 verse
[35:06] [Music]
[35:19] 26 and Joshua wrote these words in the
[35:22] book of the
[35:23] law in the book of in the book of The
[35:26] Law of God and took a great
[35:28] Stone and set it up there under an oak
[35:33] that was by the sanctuary of the
[35:35] Lord and Joshua said unto all the people
[35:38] behold this Stone shall be a witness
[35:40] unto us for it hath heard all the words
[35:43] of the Lord which he spake unto us it
[35:46] shall be therefore a witness unto you
[35:48] lest you deny your God so Joshua let the
[35:52] people depart every man unto his
[35:55] inheritance and it came to pass pass
[35:57] after these things that Joshua the son
[35:59] of nun the servant of the Lord died
[36:02] being 110 years
[36:04] old and they buried him in the border of
[36:06] his inheritance in
[36:08] timnas which is in the Mount of Ephraim
[36:11] on the north side of the hill of gash
[36:14] and Israel served the Lord all the days
[36:17] of Joshua and all the days of the elders
[36:20] that outli over lived Joshua and which
[36:23] had known all the works of the Lord that
[36:27] he had done for Israel let's bow our
[36:32] heads Heavenly

[36:55] you would guide every word that said in
[36:58] Jesus name amen God bless you you can
[37:01] take your
[37:04] seats I read that
[37:07] scripture in
[37:11] Joshua chapter
[37:16] 24 to say that that last verse
[37:20] 31 it says this and Israel served the
[37:23] Lord all the days of Joshua and all the
[37:25] days of the elders that out overlive
[37:27] Joshua and which had known all the works
[37:30] of the Lord that he had done for
[37:35] Israel it's a profound statement that's
[37:38] made in in the Book of Joshua
[37:41] there brothers and sisters from Brother
[37:45] osario church God bless you all welcome
[37:47] they're good friends of ours let's let's
[37:50] I'm sorry I should have greeted them
[37:51] earlier let's give them a a
[37:55] hand
[37:59] they're a they're a blessing to all of
[38:02] us brother orario is a good friend
[38:04] brother Rosario was a good friend of
[38:05] brother Billy Paul Brams
[38:08] also I um I I wrote down this
[38:12] scripture because I wanted to point out
[38:15] that it says here in the end of Joshua
[38:17] that that Israel served the Lord all the
[38:22] days of Joshua and all of those days of
[38:26] those Elders that had witnessed
[38:28] everything that had happened from
[38:31] Moses all the way to the end of Joshua
[38:34] great Miracles had happened during those
[38:37] times we'd seen they had seen the the
[38:41] Lord come down in a mighty way and lay
[38:45] plagues upon Egypt when they were in
[38:48] bondage they saw the Flies and and they
[38:50] saw the hail come down and they saw the
[38:54] Nile River turn to blood
[38:57] in A great
[38:59] miracle and then they saw the hand of
[39:01] the Lord come down and the Death Angel
[39:03] come in to the city in Egypt and strike
[39:08] all of the firstborn dead and they
[39:10] remembered the lamp or the the blood
[39:14] that was on the doorpost and on the L
[39:16] and how that the the fathers would put
[39:20] that on the doorpost and the Death Angel
[39:23] when all of the deaths came came by when
[39:26] all the Egyptians were dying the isra
[39:29] Israelites didn't die because they had
[39:31] followed the word of the
[39:33] Lord these Elders remembered these
[39:37] things and then they saw coming out of
[39:40] Egypt they saw in a mighty hand they
[39:43] came out and they saw them go into the
[39:45] Red Sea and the water on both sides part
[39:47] up and they saw the Israelites walk
[39:52] through on dry
[39:54] ground and then the greatest army in the
[39:57] world came after them they turned they
[40:00] saw the waters come down in the on the
[40:03] ocean and destroy the greatest army in
[40:06] the whole world they saw these
[40:08] things they saw after Moses died they
[40:13] saw that Joshua came over part of the
[40:17] water on the Jordan River they saw that
[40:22] that Moses or that Joshua came over and
[40:25] then they sieged the city and they saw
[40:28] the armies come around the city seven
[40:30] times and then the greatest walls of the
[40:33] greatest the greatest city in the whole
[40:35] area fell down and they came in and they
[40:38] conquered without losing a
[40:40] man amazing they saw these things
[40:44] happen but when those brothers passed
[40:48] away and those sisters and those stories
[40:50] that they would tell and the witness
[40:52] when they passed away the faith of the
[40:57] people left
[41:00] God and then we turn into the Book of
[41:02] Judges and it says that the men and the
[41:05] women they started to do what was right
[41:07] in their own eyes and they forgot they
[41:09] forgot the
[41:11] Lord and I think that this
[41:16] man Billy Paul brandham brother bram's
[41:20] son what did this man
[41:23] see the power of of the Holy Spirit in
[41:28] these meetings that brother that brother
[41:30] Billy Paul saw just as a young
[41:33] man he saw 20,000 people smash their
[41:37] Idols in the name of the Lord Jesus in
[41:39] South Africa saw the dust coming
[41:43] up and them giving their hearts to the
[41:46] Lord he sat there in Durban and he saw
[41:49] the trucks coming by that were filled
[41:51] with wheelchairs and stretchers and and
[41:54] crutches and all these things this man
[41:56] saw those
[41:58] things he saw the Miracles and he saw
[42:00] the the power in Mexico and in India and
[42:03] all of these things that happened he was
[42:05] a witness and he saw
[42:08] it and that's who we're talking about
[42:11] tonight is this brother Billy Paul he
[42:14] saw the prophet of God stand in the
[42:18] pulpit and discern the very thoughts and
[42:21] intents of the heart as the people came
[42:23] by and he was never wrong
[42:27] never one time was there a
[42:30] mistake and thank God we have the tapes
[42:33] we have them recorded you can
[42:36] listen coming through the the aisle the
[42:39] line brother brandom every single one
[42:43] never from 1947 to 1965 not one mistake
[42:47] how could that ever how could ever that
[42:50] be amen it couldn't be unless God was
[42:54] there he saw the prophet of God in
[42:58] operation and he saw the
[43:00] man he saw him weak he saw him get tired
[43:04] he saw him after he would take he would
[43:07] take him from from the
[43:10] pulpit beat down and tired and he' drive
[43:13] him around and he saw the carnality of
[43:16] the
[43:17] man he saw that
[43:20] that he he would he would get weak and
[43:23] and he saw that he liked a fish and he
[43:25] saw that he liked to hunt and he saw the
[43:28] man behind the prophet and then he also
[43:31] saw the
[43:33] dad he saw his own dad forsake his
[43:40] family for the people he saw this man
[43:44] leave his wife leave his little
[43:49] children to go throughout the country go
[43:52] around the world and and and preach and
[43:54] get weak and be criticized and do all
[43:56] this thing brother Billy saw saw that he
[44:00] saw the
[44:02] dad he saw that this
[44:05] man he saw every aspect of the man named
[44:09] William
[44:09] brandham and brother Billy stood by him
[44:13] every moment of the way I want to play
[44:16] something that we heard last

[47:04] was probably most of you maybe never met
[47:09] him but he was somebody that brother
[47:12] Billy dedicated his
[47:15] life just like brother brandom said I
[47:18] want to hand it to brother Billy he
[47:19] dedicated his life to his dad and his
[47:24] dad's Ministry even after brother
[47:27] Brandon passed away brother Billy Paul
[47:29] dedicated his life to having other
[47:32] people hear that same gospel he was a he
[47:35] was a tremendous tremendous friend he
[47:40] was a tremendous brother
[47:43] and a selfless person never drawing
[47:48] attention to himself he hated the
[47:49] spotlight he he didn't like to get up
[47:51] and testify he he just all all he wanted
[47:54] to do was be with his
[47:57] dad and share this gospel with other
[48:01] people that's the man that passed away
[48:05] recently he was he was a good friend to
[48:08] me just an absolute ever since I was as
[48:13] younger than you boys I mean when I mean
[48:15] I've been friends our families have been
[48:17] friends for my whole life my grandpa
[48:19] wheeler was close with brother Billy
[48:22] Paul my my dad was about the same age
[48:25] they grew up together they um used to
[48:29] Fellowship when they were younger he was
[48:32] he was an integral part of my life
[48:34] growing up and and I have to say that he
[48:36] was a positive influence in every aspect
[48:39] of his life on me I appreciate him he um
[48:44] one thing with brother Billy Paul is he
[48:47] loved the
[48:49] youth the the young people he had a
[48:52] great burden for them and he he he just
[48:55] thought the world for him and he was of
[48:57] him and he was always there if you
[49:00] needed him he was always there for me
[49:02] when I was when I was a young
[49:04] man and um so I felt in my heart to play
[49:09] it's about 45
[49:12] minutes um to play brother Billy Paul
[49:15] giving his
[49:16] testimony up at uh in Saskatchewan
[49:20] Canada and I think that uh I think that
[49:23] you're gonna love it I I started it
[49:26] where brother Billy talks about that he
[49:29] was able to see the same Angel of the
[49:34] Lord that we hear brother brandom talk
[49:35] about so much if it's just one
[49:39] man saying
[49:41] it saying that this Angel is he comes to
[49:45] me and he speaks to me but then when you
[49:48] put another man in the mix and that
[49:50] other man sees the same angel now you've
[49:54] got a witness
[49:57] and now you
[49:58] see that this brother Billy Paul he got
[50:03] to see that same angel that we hear so
[50:07] much about brother Jeremy if you could
[50:09] go ahead and start the video as I said
[50:12] it's about 45 minutes long it's brother
[50:14] Billy Paul's testimony and if you
[50:16] haven't seen it I uh I know it's going
[50:19] to be a blessing and if you have seen it
[50:21] I also know it's going to be a blessing
[50:22] to you go ahead brother Jeremy thank you
[50:26] as I began the travel my dad would tell
[50:29] me just like you hear the tapes and you
[50:31] hear your mother and dad tell you
[50:33] different things but until you
[50:39] have until you have a personal
[50:41] experience with Jesus Christ is just
[50:44] words
[50:45] yes you've got to be borned
[50:49] again when I was 12 years old how old
[50:52] are you
[50:54] Luke
[50:56] eight eight I was a little bit older
[50:58] than Luke probably not as big but I was
[51:01] but
[51:02] anyway my dad I'd hear him talk about
[51:04] the
[51:06] angel and I love to tell this part of my
[51:08] testimony and I know everyone of you
[51:10] heard it but I'm just going to tell it
[51:11] to you
[51:13] again I'd hear my
[51:15] dat talk about the
[51:18] angel and brother BR not only preached
[51:20] your a message but he lived your a
[51:22] message did he was a poor man he wasn't
[51:26] a rich man no he wasn't a rich man at
[51:30] all and he'd stay in the cheapest of
[51:34] Hotel he'd eat less food and have us to
[51:40] so it wouldn't be hard on you for the
[51:42] expenses of the meetings he not only
[51:45] preached your message but he lived your
[51:47] message we stay in this little hotel in
[51:50] velia
[51:51] Illinois and I was about 12 years old
[51:56] and he woke me up one morning and I I
[51:59] wasn't giving out prayer cards in I was
[52:01] just a little bit long bigger than Luke
[52:03] there but I was selling three little
[52:05] books one was called I was not

[52:26] give you you sell you books before the
[52:28] meeting start and the tent
[52:30] meetings when I come home that night my
[52:33] dad was sleeping in a bed right

[52:57] talking about it it had Lo what you call
[52:58] them things you pour the picture you

[53:33] uncle up
[53:35] Donnie and he said you can wake up
[53:38] Billy that don't make me no more than
[53:41] you or anybody else but it was just what

[53:53] you he said when Daddy takes takes the
[53:55] pillow from your
[53:57] eyes he said you look over where that
[53:59] war spacing is and there stands the

[54:15] Rob had hair down to his shoulders 200
[54:19] 100 lbs or so he had his arms folded
[54:22] like that and all he do would just move
[54:24] his head back and forth and keep his eye
[54:26] on Daddy it scared me to death you say
[54:30] it wouldn't scare me you just haven't
[54:32] seen
[54:34] you there was a reverence I can't tell
[54:36] you about but he says he sent from the
[54:40] presence of God and I grabbed my daddy I
[54:43] was scared to death he said Paul he
[54:45] won't harm you he said I asked him if he
[54:48] could see you he never spoke a word to
[54:51] me or to Daddy but I'll never forget his
[54:54] eyes just looking back and forth at
[54:56] Daddy back and forth and I held on to my
[55:00] daddy and he clutched me up and he went
[55:02] from that being like a man in that room
[55:06] out that window before he went he just
[55:09] went into like a Mist like a vapor and
[55:13] he disappeared out the window and when
[55:16] he left a rainbow at 3:00 in the morning
[55:20] come and stood in that room from that
[55:23] day to this day I can tell you when he's
[55:26] there I might have been in Africa India
[55:29] anywhere I'd be Daddy had call the
[55:31] prayer line and I'd be working the
[55:33] prayer line down there getting the

[1:01:02] people just to get him to touch that
[1:01:05] baby not even knowing if they'd get that
[1:01:07] baby back but they knew that God was in
[1:01:11] that
[1:01:12] man so do you know that God was in that
[1:01:17] man I saw the
[1:01:20] Redeemer living in a redeemed one I
[1:01:25] don't worship him but I glorify the God
[1:01:27] that was
[1:01:28] in I may not understand it but I believe
[1:01:31] it and I don't compromise on I'm not
[1:01:34] want to be no smile like but I don't
[1:01:36] compromise on nothing to do that my job
[1:01:40] was to pass out prayer cards to get him
[1:01:43] in and out of the
[1:01:44] meeting what a privilege you say oh I we
[1:01:48] start no you don't want that job no it
[1:01:51] was a wonderful job I don't mean that
[1:01:55] I see him in a prayer line he'd always
[1:01:57] bring the people from this side and I'd
[1:02:00] bring the people up and said I'm in a
[1:02:02] chair and he say watch
[1:02:05] me watch me and I see him he go like
[1:02:10] this you seen him on the film and I knew
[1:02:13] then he was getting numb he didn't know
[1:02:15] what he was where he was at and I'd have
[1:02:18] the prayer line well I'd stop the prayer
[1:02:20] line because I knew it was time to go
[1:02:22] get him and I'll tell you some test that
[1:02:24] I
[1:02:25] saw
[1:02:27] but I'm talking about my job now okay my
[1:02:31] job was to get him in and out to get you
[1:02:33] up there to be prayed
[1:02:35] for just to stand before
[1:02:38] him and I've seen him I see him start
[1:02:41] doing this be getting a little weak and
[1:02:44] I'd stop the prayer line and he knew
[1:02:47] when he didn't see no one in that chair
[1:02:50] he might not even see me but when no one
[1:02:52] was in that chair then he knew it was
[1:02:55] time to to quit because sometimes didn't
[1:02:57] know worri is at and I'd leave and come
[1:02:59] over and I'd touch him on his side put
[1:03:02] my arms around him what a
[1:03:05] privilege that anointing was so
[1:03:08] strong it didn't make any difference if
[1:03:10] I had a headache a
[1:03:13] toothache in that presence everything
[1:03:16] left
[1:03:18] amen and I touch him on his side like
[1:03:21] this brother
[1:03:23] Paul and if he was talking to you maybe
[1:03:27] calling people out in the audience and I
[1:03:28] touch him like that if he didn't answer
[1:03:31] me back I'd pick him up and take him off
[1:03:34] the platform but he'd sometimes he'd
[1:03:36] touch me back the people didn't know but
[1:03:40] he'd be saying Paul leave me alone I
[1:03:43] know what I'm doing then he'd make an
[1:03:45] ALT to call whatever you say well that's
[1:03:48] no it's not because one time I take him
[1:03:52] out too early
[1:03:55] I thought it was time to take
[1:03:57] him I thought I was doing my job
[1:04:00] right and I take him too quick and he'd
[1:04:03] say Paul if you just left me a little
[1:04:05] longer I could have prayed for some more
[1:04:08] oh I a kid 14 years
[1:04:12] old so I took him too quick then maybe
[1:04:16] the next night I take him too
[1:04:18] early next night I take let him stay too
[1:04:23] long then he said Paul you let me stay
[1:04:26] too long he said don't give my prayer
[1:04:29] cards tomorrow night because I don't
[1:04:30] have strength to pray for the
[1:04:34] people don't feel sorry for me but it
[1:04:36] was a hard
[1:04:38] life but it was a wonderful
[1:04:42] life I said Daddy why why did the Lord
[1:04:46] let me see that angel he said because
[1:04:50] you were called to work with me
[1:04:53] son I heard a tape the other day not to
[1:04:56] brother Billy CU I don't even deserve to
[1:04:58] stand before you I'm not trying to be
[1:04:59] humble I'm just pouring my heart out to
[1:05:04] you he
[1:05:07] said he
[1:05:09] said if it hadn't been for Billy he said
[1:05:13] I would have been an insane institution
[1:05:15] long many years
[1:05:17] ago so whatever God let me do I'm
[1:05:20] thankful for
[1:05:22] it but he told you the truth yes and God
[1:05:27] Vindicated that it was the
[1:05:29] truth like I
[1:05:31] said he was a Jesus
[1:05:34] man God loved him so
[1:05:37] much I'm getting ready to start
[1:05:41] am that he spoke of him right here in
[1:05:44] this
[1:05:46] word if you believe it say Amen if you
[1:05:48] don't want to
[1:05:51] quit he spoke of him in his word and at
[1:05:54] his birth like on the trivia
[1:05:57] yesterday the light came down and hung
[1:06:01] on a man sent from God he spoke of him
[1:06:06] at his birth and when he was baptized in
[1:06:08] his 17th person on the trivia yesterday
[1:06:12] Eddie C the light come down and said as
[1:06:15] John the Baptist was sent to forun the
[1:06:17] first coming of Christ you will for my
[1:06:20] second
[1:06:21] coming he loved him so much that in
[1:06:24] Greensville in the
[1:06:26] cave he said you're I'm he said if you
[1:06:29] get the people to believe you and be
[1:06:32] sincere when you pray nothing will stand
[1:06:36] before your prayer not even
[1:06:44] cancer not even cancer he loved him so
[1:06:51] much that he had his picture taken with
[1:06:53] him
[1:06:54] the only supernatural being that was
[1:06:57] ever photographed don't let it become
[1:07:00] common to
[1:07:01] you brother brandham said a man looked
[1:07:03] at that picture and laughed and he said
[1:07:07] it was nothing less than to blaspheme
[1:07:09] the Holy
[1:07:11] Ghost that's what brother brand said he

[1:33:39] well Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:33:42] today and
[1:33:50] forever what witness our brother is
[1:33:53] brother Billy Paul imagine if you would
[1:33:56] have seen all of that imagine how much
[1:33:58] faith that you would have
[1:34:02] if that that scripture in Joshua that
[1:34:06] said that when these people
[1:34:09] left that that they the Israel stopped
[1:34:13] serving the lord and you can see telling
[1:34:16] stories like this it just builds our
[1:34:18] faith Lord you can do anything you're
[1:34:21] just you're an amazing God and and to
[1:34:24] see what brother Billy Paul saw in his
[1:34:27] dad's Ministry and for him to be able to
[1:34:30] give us those testimonies and now
[1:34:32] they're recorded on YouTube and all
[1:34:35] these other places so what a what a
[1:34:37] blessing brother Billy Paul as I said he
[1:34:40] stayed he stayed in the as you know the
[1:34:43] stayed in the ministry after brother
[1:34:44] Brandon passed away they started spoken
[1:34:47] word Publications then um Brother Joseph
[1:34:49] brandham started um voice of God
[1:34:52] Recordings brother Billy Paul stayed in
[1:34:55] working in the work of the Lord Brother
[1:34:57] Billy's job at voice of God was he would
[1:35:00] listen to the
[1:35:02] sermons and he would put in what's
[1:35:05] called The Gap so you Spanish-speaking
[1:35:08] Brethren you um there's a gap where
[1:35:12] brother brandom would speak and then the
[1:35:15] translator would be would be inserted in
[1:35:18] there so brother Billy as he was
[1:35:20] listening he didn't want to hurt the
[1:35:22] spirit as brother brandom's speaking as
[1:35:24] a translator can so he would let it go a
[1:35:27] couple sentences and he'd say okay
[1:35:29] that's the right place and he would put
[1:35:30] a gap in there then the translators
[1:35:34] could come in and put the translation in
[1:35:37] so and then they would do the whole
[1:35:38] sermon like that and hundreds of sermons
[1:35:40] were done like that brother Billy Paul
[1:35:42] got to listen to all of them and put in
[1:35:44] those gaps in the right place so the
[1:35:47] translator could speak and that people
[1:35:49] that don't speak English could could
[1:35:51] could hear these things he was and then
[1:35:55] of course brother Billy Paul was brother
[1:35:57] Billy Paul everybody knew him he was um
[1:36:00] he would call me sometimes and ask ask
[1:36:03] me for help and uh where's brother
[1:36:05] Jonathan so brother Jonathan we got a
[1:36:07] group from Congo that came in and um
[1:36:12] brother Billy said uh he'd call me up
[1:36:14] and it was always Dan can you come down
[1:36:19] yes sir so I came came down and it was
[1:36:22] the funniest thing they were all excited
[1:36:27] these these Africans from Congo and they
[1:36:30] were all excited about brother brandom
[1:36:32] and they were all excited about meeting
[1:36:33] his son and there was brother Billy
[1:36:36] standing
[1:36:37] there and they were all kneeled around
[1:36:41] him and he was trying to get them to get
[1:36:44] up and they wouldn't get up and he
[1:36:46] looked at me and he said Dan come
[1:36:50] here so I came down he says help you
[1:36:53] know fix this so I talked to I talked to
[1:36:57] all the African Brothers brothers and
[1:36:59] sisters I got them up and but you can
[1:37:01] imagine something someone that means so
[1:37:04] much to the people and brother Billy
[1:37:07] Paul just made it real I uh brother
[1:37:10] Glenn right there brother Glenn McHugh
[1:37:13] back there ra raise your hands so
[1:37:15] everybody can look at
[1:37:17] you we know who you are but brother
[1:37:20] Glenn
[1:37:22] um you've heard of brother Doug McHugh
[1:37:24] that's brother Glenn's brother brother
[1:37:26] Doug was brother brand or brother Billy
[1:37:28] Paul's best friend in the whole world so
[1:37:31] brother Glenn it's it's good to have you
[1:37:33] thank thank you for coming but brother
[1:37:35] Billy Paul so I got to work with him a
[1:37:37] lot and and one of the benefits in
[1:37:41] working with brother Billy Paul is I got
[1:37:44] to hear all of these testimonies that
[1:37:47] that you heard right there I got to hear
[1:37:48] them firsthand brother Billy Paul told
[1:37:51] told me a story one time he said uh he
[1:37:54] goes you know he said we were down in
[1:37:56] Florida and have you heard of FF
[1:38:00] Bosworth brother Bosworth was a great
[1:38:03] man of God he was he was there in the
[1:38:06] 1906 of zza Street Revival and uh when
[1:38:10] when the when really the the tongue
[1:38:12] started going forth and the Pentecostal
[1:38:14] Revival happened to went around the
[1:38:15] world then brother Bosworth left there
[1:38:18] and he actually was one of the founders
[1:38:20] of the Assemblies of God
[1:38:23] denomination so then after the assembly
[1:38:26] of Assemblies of God denomination
[1:38:28] started brother Bosworth said you know
[1:38:30] what you're saying that speaking in
[1:38:33] tongues is the initial evidence of the
[1:38:35] Holy Spirit he said it's not in the
[1:38:38] Bible that and it was a big rift and
[1:38:41] brother
[1:38:42] Bosworth said and he wrote a
[1:38:46] letter open letter to everyone he says I
[1:38:48] am resigning from the Assembly of God
[1:38:52] denomination because that you are
[1:38:55] putting something that is not God's word
[1:38:58] and you're taking it as God's word
[1:39:00] saying that you have to do it a certain
[1:39:03] way or the Lord won't fill you with the
[1:39:06] Holy Spirit or that this is the only
[1:39:09] evidence he said it is an Evidence but
[1:39:10] it's wrong so he left and he saw
[1:39:14] remember I said the isua Street Revival
[1:39:16] brother Bosworth saw some of the
[1:39:19] greatest Miracles and a one of the
[1:39:21] greatest revivals really that the
[1:39:23] world's ever had was theusa stre so he
[1:39:26] then they they started the Assemblies of
[1:39:28] God he left and he was still he said
[1:39:31] there was just something not
[1:39:34] fulfilled and then brother Bosworth met
[1:39:37] William brandom and he said this is what
[1:39:40] I've been looking for my whole life so
[1:39:43] brother Billy Paul knew brother Bosworth
[1:39:46] so one time brother Bosworth as I said
[1:39:48] brother Bosworth was part of all of
[1:39:50] these healings and he himself had a
[1:39:52] great gift of healing and he got old and
[1:39:55] brother Bosworth was he would he would
[1:39:57] travel with brother brandham and many
[1:39:59] times brother Bosworth or brother
[1:40:01] Brandon would pray for the sick and the
[1:40:04] other one would rest well this was
[1:40:05] brother Bosworth was praying brother
[1:40:07] brandham was going to preach the next
[1:40:10] the next service the next morning
[1:40:12] brother Bosworth as I said was an old
[1:40:14] man and he was hard a
[1:40:15] hearing and they had the prayer line
[1:40:18] coming up and brother Bosworth had the
[1:40:21] man come and and and they said the man's
[1:40:25] deaf and brother Bosworth says okay he
[1:40:29] says okay turn around and face the
[1:40:31] audience and he put his hands on the the
[1:40:34] deaf man's
[1:40:36] ears and he said now brother Billy Paul
[1:40:39] was here brother Brandon was back in the
[1:40:41] hotel room and brother Billy Paul was
[1:40:43] standing there on the platform and he
[1:40:45] was watching all this come to come about
[1:40:48] brother Bosworth put his hands on the
[1:40:50] man's ears and he prays for him and he
[1:40:54] says now brother receive your
[1:40:56] hearing and he said can you hear me the
[1:41:01] brother said I can hear you and he said
[1:41:05] brother you're going to have to believe
[1:41:06] more he says you're not having you're
[1:41:09] not having enough Faith remember brother
[1:41:10] Bosworth was hard of hear him and he put
[1:41:13] his hands on his ears again and he said
[1:41:16] Lord Heal this man he said he said give
[1:41:20] this man the faith and he
[1:41:23] said he said can you hear
[1:41:27] me and the brother said I can hear
[1:41:31] you and he said brother you're going to
[1:41:34] have to you're going to have to have
[1:41:36] more faith and he prayed for him again
[1:41:38] and the brother turned
[1:41:40] around and he said brother I can hear
[1:41:44] but it looks like you're going to have
[1:41:45] to be prayed for
[1:41:47] now so brother Billy Paul watched this
[1:41:50] whole thing and he told me that story he
[1:41:52] says I went back to the hotel and he
[1:41:56] said Daddy was crying he was laughing so
[1:42:01] hard that at that at that testimony
[1:42:05] so the it was all brother brandom had a
[1:42:08] good sense of humor brother Billy Paul
[1:42:10] had a good sense of humor he um brother
[1:42:12] Billy Paul loved the fish I remember
[1:42:15] Salem Noble road is um by voice of God
[1:42:19] Recordings is on is on Salem Noble
[1:42:22] brother Billy Paul doesn't live too far
[1:42:24] from there and I was Salem Noble's a a
[1:42:27] really narrow road and I was driving
[1:42:30] down Salem
[1:42:32] Noble and here comes this guy in this
[1:42:36] truck and he is all over the road
[1:42:40] pulling a
[1:42:41] boat and I'm coming this way and he's
[1:42:44] coming this way
[1:42:46] and runs me Salem Noble doesn't have a
[1:42:49] shoulder so it runs me all all the way
[1:42:51] almost off the road over here and he
[1:42:52] comes by and I was like what is that and
[1:42:54] it was brother Billy
[1:42:57] Paul he all over he was um still
[1:43:03] driving at 80s something years
[1:43:06] old
[1:43:08] um brother Billy told me well he told a
[1:43:11] lot of us a testimony one
[1:43:14] time the power I've told this testimony
[1:43:17] before but for our visitors the power
[1:43:19] went out a voice of
[1:43:21] God and um we were uh so we all kind of
[1:43:26] went down into the mail room it was the
[1:43:27] biggest room that was in the building
[1:43:31] and we all were sitting on the tables
[1:43:32] and just talking because everybody's
[1:43:34] computers were down and and nothing was
[1:43:36] working lights were out so brother Billy
[1:43:40] Paul and Brother Joseph brandham were
[1:43:43] sitting on the table kind of in the
[1:43:45] corner and all of us were around them
[1:43:49] probably 50 people and Brother Joseph
[1:43:51] said brother Billy he said he said he

[1:45:59] something out of the blue I never told
[1:46:03] Brother Billy Paul anything I never let
[1:46:05] him know any any of my secrets I didn't
[1:46:08] I didn't I didn't talk outside of
[1:46:11] myself and brother Billy
[1:46:14] Paul he sets me down and he says he says
[1:46:18] I want to tell you he says
[1:46:21] Daddy and
[1:46:22] I he saysi went to pick up Daddy for
[1:46:26] church a Sunday morning he says and I
[1:46:30] got him and and we were driving and he
[1:46:33] said um Daddy I got to stop by and I got
[1:46:36] to get some
[1:46:37] gas and he said brother brandom told him
[1:46:40] he said Billy he says you can get gas on
[1:46:44] Saturday he says you don't have to go
[1:46:47] and and get gas on Sunday it's the
[1:46:49] Lord's Day brother Billy said he said
[1:46:53] and you could see his nature very
[1:46:56] tenderhearted brother Billy Paul was
[1:46:59] just tender and his dad could just crush
[1:47:01] him with a word and he he said it just
[1:47:05] crushed me he said Daddy I'm sorry he
[1:47:08] says I got enough he said we'll be fine
[1:47:10] I can get it tomorrow he said no Billy
[1:47:13] he said stop by go to the gas station
[1:47:15] get the gas he says but just try not to
[1:47:18] do that
[1:47:21] so then he said and another time he
[1:47:23] said' we were driving home from
[1:47:25] church and he said
[1:47:29] mom sister
[1:47:31] brandom said she needed to get some milk
[1:47:34] she said she called brother brandom
[1:47:36] Billy she said Billy can you stop I need
[1:47:39] to get some I need to get some
[1:47:41] milk and he
[1:47:43] said he said uh to Sister brandom he
[1:47:46] said honey he
[1:47:49] said we've
[1:47:51] got seven or six days in the week that
[1:47:54] you can go shopping he says you don't
[1:47:57] have to go to the grocery to get milk on
[1:48:00] Sunday brother and sister brandom said
[1:48:03] oh she says she says I'm sorry she says
[1:48:05] I can get it tomorrow it'll be okay we
[1:48:06] can we can get it at the at the grocery
[1:48:08] store tomorrow he said no he said it's
[1:48:11] okay so he drives and and he pulls in
[1:48:13] and he gets out and he goes and picks up
[1:48:15] the milk brings it back he said let's
[1:48:19] just try why not to do that brother
[1:48:23] Billy told me those two stories and he
[1:48:26] looked me in the eye and he said Dan he
[1:48:30] said Daddy was not a
[1:48:32] legalist telling me
[1:48:36] that I was
[1:48:38] right in in some of the things that I
[1:48:41] was feeling he said daddy wasn't like
[1:48:43] that but do you see he still honored the
[1:48:47] Lord's day he still did his best to
[1:48:50] serve God but he's brother Billy wanted
[1:48:53] to point out to me no that he wasn't
[1:48:57] like that and then he told
[1:49:01] me as we talked he said he started
[1:49:05] telling me about my own Ministry and he
[1:49:07] started talking to me about some things
[1:49:10] that he thought maybe were going to
[1:49:12] happen in the future and it was just
[1:49:15] when I left that
[1:49:17] office I was just on top of the
[1:49:21] world and it struck me that number one
[1:49:27] brother Billy knew that I was feeling
[1:49:30] down brother brandham said that he had a
[1:49:32] gift of discernment and then number two
[1:49:36] that he would take all of that time for
[1:49:39] me to sit me in his office across from
[1:49:42] him and just tell me these things just
[1:49:45] to encourage me and that's the kind of
[1:49:47] man that our brother was brother Billy
[1:49:50] Paul brother
[1:49:57] Arie thank you for coming and I remember
[1:50:02] brother Billy Paul gave his testimony
[1:50:03] here years ago and the place was really
[1:50:05] packed I mean they had the chapel with
[1:50:08] the screen and the fellowship hall with
[1:50:11] screens and sound so it was it's it's
[1:50:14] amazing to me what you get on YouTube I
[1:50:16] just looked at the YouTube 100,000
[1:50:19] 200,000 Maybe in 8 years for a man of
[1:50:22] God you know telling a testimony and
[1:50:24] I've seen patterns like that but anyway
[1:50:27] I've been thinking about God our Father
[1:50:30] and I'm thinking about you now that you
[1:50:33] each one of you are his child even when
[1:50:36] job
[1:50:38] was uh going through his trial it said
[1:50:41] when the sons of God Satan went up there
[1:50:43] and he was talking to God and and so you
[1:50:46] know it's not our job to really put
[1:50:48] people in our out this you know what I
[1:50:50] mean that's I'm getting off on
[1:50:54] but in 55 I was only two years in a
[1:50:58] month old and my mom had wanted to have
[1:51:00] brother BR pray for teeth in Chicago we
[1:51:02] went to about 75 to 100 meetings my dad
[1:51:05] said and my mom
[1:51:09] sister was put in the hospital for a
[1:51:13] heart trouble called romatic fever her
[1:51:15] heart was damaged the rest of her life
[1:51:17] the doctor said she wouldn't live to 25
[1:51:20] be 25 so I I told Jeremy where this is
[1:51:23] and the reason I tied it in is
[1:51:26] because God your father he sees each one
[1:51:30] of you and and I I thought you know when
[1:51:33] you patter an elk you or deer anything
[1:51:36] you you kind of get to see where they're
[1:51:38] at and you want to know their habit or
[1:51:40] pattern well I thought about
[1:51:44] God his pattern is that he's paternal I
[1:51:47] just say that so you won't forget
[1:51:49] because he's your father each one of you
[1:51:52] and if he's answered prayers I've seen
[1:51:54] prayers answered for people that do not
[1:51:56] deserve an answer to prayer I mean I
[1:51:58] know that for a fact but he did answer
[1:52:01] prayers and when they forgot about it he
[1:52:03] still would answer prayers so he's got
[1:52:05] his own program we just need to get with
[1:52:08] it okay so he I'm going to let him play
[1:52:11] but brother brandom missed brother Billy
[1:52:13] Paul and this is in memory of brother
[1:52:15] Billy
[1:52:16] Paul which I've met a few times and and
[1:52:20] um and even ate with him a few times but
[1:52:25] I wanted you to see where brother Bram
[1:52:27] was tight with him and then the other
[1:52:30] thing I wanted you to see was my mom
[1:52:32] wanted brother Brown to pray for her
[1:52:34] teeth but she' forgot about it totally
[1:52:37] forgot because of her sister and she but
[1:52:40] God did not forget that's the part I
[1:52:42] wanted you to when you pray a prayer and
[1:52:45] there's a man that came I would like to
[1:52:48] have prayer for him is his name is
[1:52:50] Christopher he's so sweet he's on fit
[1:52:54] and all and he came up here today after
[1:52:57] this morning service and then Carlos
[1:53:00] came by at the same time you know he's
[1:53:03] got a new phone but he it's just I don't
[1:53:07] know why I just think God if he can put
[1:53:11] that bird why is it there if it's
[1:53:14] not you know brother uh Daniel's been
[1:53:18] very patient with me and understanding
[1:53:20] it and I just can't help if you just
[1:53:23] meet this BR boy the brother and he's
[1:53:26] just in such pain you know oh God so
[1:53:30] okay now well let's go back to

[1:55:53] your experience with your family and
[1:55:55] everything but you

[1:55:59] thought you know let's just say you you
[1:56:01] were working for Elon Musk nobody liked
[1:56:04] you but Elon Musk did like you it' make
[1:56:07] a big difference wouldn't it yeah if you
[1:56:08] were working for him so you each one of
[1:56:11] you can be just that close to God as
[1:56:13] close as you want to be isn't that b
[1:56:16] beautiful and Powerful amen amen
[1:56:21] amen did you
[1:56:23] notice did you
[1:56:26] notice that brother Billy Paul's
[1:56:30] presence struck brother brandom he

[1:56:36] amazing and then there's brother arie's
[1:56:38] Mother forgot to put it on the prayer
[1:56:41] card forgot to mention her teeth and
[1:56:43] there was brother brandom showing that

[1:56:49] teeth and her being healed
[1:56:52] amen um does anyone have a testimony

[1:56:57] Paul anyone else I can either bring the
[1:56:59] microphone down or I can uh we can come
[1:57:04] here
[1:57:07] anyone brother Billy Paul was as I
[1:57:11] said he was
[1:57:13] uh he was precious to me and especially
[1:57:18] when I was a young man
[1:57:19] to see someone as important as brother
[1:57:24] Billy Paul take the time to speak to a
[1:57:28] nobody like me being 18 19 20 years old
[1:57:32] or whatever I was brother Billy taking
[1:57:35] his time and talking to me about the
[1:57:38] Lord talking to me about brother brandom
[1:57:40] he called me on the phone a couple times
[1:57:43] at home just wanting to talk to me and
[1:57:47] and just show his love and I think if
[1:57:48] that was me
[1:57:50] how many other people did this man do
[1:57:53] that to it's just he was he was a
[1:57:57] tremendous gift to the body of Christ
[1:58:02] and he uh he was he was a wonderful gift
[1:58:06] to me I'll sh I'll share one more
[1:58:07] testimony and then I'll quit this one
[1:58:09] might not this isn't a miracle but it
[1:58:11] might it might show a little bit
[1:58:16] about brother brandom and his prophetic
[1:58:20] gift brother Billy Paul and brother
[1:58:22] Brandon were in South Africa and if you
[1:58:24] know if you listen to the
[1:58:26] tapes brother um Billy
[1:58:30] was with it was uh Gordon Lindsay and FF
[1:58:35] Bosworth and a number of the other ones
[1:58:38] and they were pressuring brother branam
[1:58:41] to have meetings in in certain cities
[1:58:44] brother brandham had prayed about it and
[1:58:46] the Lord forbade him to go to these
[1:58:50] cities and
[1:58:51] instead the Lord said no go over here
[1:58:55] and go on this hunting
[1:58:57] trip so brother brother brandom said
[1:59:00] Brethren he says I believe the Lord
[1:59:02] doesn't want this to
[1:59:04] happen brother Billy Paul is the one
[1:59:08] person in all of that group brother
[1:59:11] Billy Paul stood up for his dad and he
[1:59:14] said Daddy needs to go on the hunting
[1:59:17] trip all of the other ones brother
[1:59:19] Bosworth who I mentioned Who Loved
[1:59:21] brother Bram Gordon Lindsay loved
[1:59:22] brother brandham all the other Brethren
[1:59:23] said no you need to preach at these
[1:59:26] meetings there's going to be tens of
[1:59:28] thousands of people there you need to be
[1:59:31] there brother brandom said okay I'll
[1:59:35] go and he takes a branch of a eucalyptus
[1:59:40] tree and he breaks it
[1:59:43] off and he comes over to the men and
[1:59:47] brother Billy Paul was standing there
[1:59:49] there he takes the branch and he starts
[1:59:53] waving the branch dusting the branch on
[1:59:57] The Minister's feet and he started
[2:00:00] saying thus sayeth the Lord thus sayeth
[2:00:03] the Lord thus sayeth the Lord thus
[2:00:06] sayeth the Lord didn't do brother
[2:00:10] billies left the
[2:00:12] branch came back they had the
[2:00:15] meetings every single person
[2:00:20] in that group of people including
[2:00:23] brother
[2:00:24] branam got what's called an amoeba
[2:00:27] parasite and almost died
[2:00:30] except brother Billy Paul
[2:00:33] brandham brother brandham said the
[2:00:35] reason that Billy Paul didn't get it is
[2:00:39] because he stood up for the Holy Spirit
[2:00:41] and he stood up for what I said and that
[2:00:44] was that was that young man that we just
[2:00:47] heard preach right here we listen to as
[2:00:50] I said life story the other
[2:00:53] day and I was in my hotel room and going
[2:00:58] through the hurricane as you all were
[2:01:00] listening and the thing that struck me
[2:01:05] so much and if the musicians could come
[2:01:09] the thing that struck me so much
[2:01:14] was there is brother branam and he has
[2:01:18] this vision
[2:01:20] and he goes beyond the curtain of
[2:01:22] time and he
[2:01:24] sees different people that he knew and
[2:01:28] he sees one special young lady and this
[2:01:33] young lady was his daughter Sharon rose
[2:01:36] that had died about the same time within
[2:01:39] a couple days of her
[2:01:41] mother and this young lady she was 18
[2:01:44] years old he said a real pretty girl and
[2:01:47] he said she came to him and and she says
[2:01:51] hello
[2:01:52] Dad he says
[2:01:55] dad he says how could this
[2:01:59] be and he and he finds out that this is
[2:02:02] Sharon
[2:02:03] Rose now listen to this and you all that
[2:02:06] heard the tape listen to
[2:02:10] this he starts going this way Sharon
[2:02:14] Rose his little baby says no I'm going
[2:02:17] to just stand here and wait for
[2:02:20] Billy and you think brother Andy you
[2:02:23] think
[2:02:24] maybe 10 days ago or whatever it
[2:02:27] was do you think maybe that they
[2:02:32] met that they met up beyond that curtain
[2:02:35] of time that he met his baby sister he
[2:02:39] met her in real life I bet you they she
[2:02:43] they gave each other a big hug and they
[2:02:45] started greeting people I don't know if
[2:02:46] she was first in line or second next to
[2:02:50] his dad brother brandham but they were
[2:02:53] right there she said it struck me I
[2:02:56] think I'll just wait right here for
[2:02:58] Billy and she
[2:03:00] waited I don't know 85 years for him and
[2:03:05] then there Then There came brother Billy
[2:03:07] Paul and they had a little family family
[2:03:09] reunion with sister brandom and sister
[2:03:11] hope and
[2:03:13] and brother brandom and all of them
[2:03:16] let's let's all
[2:03:17] stand
[2:03:20] if I could sum up brother Billy
[2:03:24] Paul in
[2:03:26] words he gave his life to brother
[2:03:30] brandom and then something that I saw in
[2:03:32] my own
[2:03:34] life he equally gave his life to Brother
[2:03:38] Joseph brandom his brother as Brother
[2:03:41] Joseph had it in his heart to spread
[2:03:44] brother brandom's gospel around the
[2:03:47] world and I just I always respected
[2:03:50] brother Billy Paul for that he was
[2:03:51] always
[2:03:53] willing to just serve and do what he
[2:03:56] could I always respected his loyalty
[2:03:58] also to Brother Joseph and and all those
[2:04:01] of voice of God and how they they just
[2:04:04] put this message around the world and he
[2:04:08] was selfless he loved the Lord he loved
[2:04:11] God's people he loved his dad and I'm
[2:04:16] looking forward to seeing him one day
[2:04:17] also God bless you brother Jonathan if

[2:08:10] me we have we have one short testimony
[2:08:13] before our brother closes in
[2:08:17] prayer
[2:08:20] God bless you God bless
[2:08:22] you um just before I uh speak I just
[2:08:27] want to say on behalf of my church I'm
[2:08:30] very glad to be here we're all glad to
[2:08:33] be here it's a blessing to be here
[2:08:36] amongst
[2:08:39] Believers we were invited here and I
[2:08:42] just want to thank you all for having us
[2:08:44] here but um on behalf of my church I
[2:08:47] didn't like the brother said I didn't
[2:08:49] want the opportunity to pass
[2:08:52] by because at my own church we had a
[2:08:55] little kind of memorial service for
[2:08:58] brother Billy Paul and I wasn't able to
[2:09:02] say something but I saw this as my
[2:09:06] opportunity and the brother Daniel
[2:09:09] invited uh he invited us he invited
[2:09:12] anyone to say words and I was really
[2:09:14] nervous to do so but I just wanted to
[2:09:17] say to you know the young people and
[2:09:20] everyone I got to meet him I got to meet
[2:09:23] brother Bly Paul and in 2018 our church
[2:09:28] went to Jeffersonville in June I believe
[2:09:30] it was
[2:09:32] and I just want to tell you it's all
[2:09:35] real he really was as loving as they say
[2:09:39] he was he was as kind as he was and
[2:09:43] there was a presence about him I was
[2:09:46] only 12 years old but and I didn't
[2:09:49] recognize the I I wish I could have met
[2:09:52] him now or seen him again but I didn't
[2:09:58] recognize or I couldn't see I couldn't
[2:10:00] fully grasp in just how special that was
[2:10:03] I wish I could see him
[2:10:06] again but like our brother say I will
[2:10:08] see him again
[2:10:10] amen and there's
[2:10:13] this I I looked at uh a testimony that
[2:10:16] brother B uh spoke
[2:10:19] on he was in Canada in I think it was
[2:10:22] the
[2:10:23] 1980s and there's this video on
[2:10:26] YouTube and there's these words that he
[2:10:28] says in the beginning that's stuck with
[2:10:31] me and I
[2:10:34] can't I I kind of can't get them out my
[2:10:36] head and I'd like to say it just as an
[2:10:38] encouragement to
[2:10:39] everyone and Billy Paul he says
[2:10:44] this the prophet of God said there's
[2:10:46] only one way that you'll make it that's
[2:10:49] by his Amazing Grace it's nothing that
[2:10:52] you done or I done but what he done for
[2:10:55] us on Calvary amen and I'm resting on
[2:10:59] that and I just wanted to share that on
[2:11:02] behalf of my church and thank you for
[2:11:06] having us here it's a privilege to be
[2:11:08] here to be where
[2:11:10] probibly Paul was and to be where
[2:11:13] brother Benham was and thank you very
