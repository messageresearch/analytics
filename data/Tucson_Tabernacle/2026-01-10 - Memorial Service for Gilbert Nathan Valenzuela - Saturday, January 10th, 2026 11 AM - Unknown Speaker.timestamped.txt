[0:00] Good morning and God bless each one of
[0:02] you this morning as we gather together
[0:05] here to be with the family.
[0:09] We know that God is mindful of all of
[0:11] us. So if you'll stand with me, we'll
[0:15] bow our heads in prayer
[0:17] and you talk to the Lord, too. It's not
[0:20] just the minister behind the pulpit, but
[0:22] you have as much right to ask the Lord
[0:25] to be your strength and be your comfort.
[0:30] Lord Jesus, we we come this morning
[0:34] as family, as friends,
[0:37] as part of the family of God.
[0:41] And Lord, it's in times like this that
[0:43] we can draw strength from one another.
[0:45] We can encourage one another.
[0:48] We can be [music] that help in the time
[0:51] of trouble, Lord.
[0:53] So we ask for your direction, your
[0:55] leading, your comfort, Lord, in all that
[0:57] is said and done.
[1:00] Something that [music] would give us
[1:02] strength to continue on as the days go
[1:04] forward. Lord, we commit each one and
[1:08] each person, each heart here [music] and
[1:11] this time to you
[1:13] in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:17] The very first verse
[1:19] of Amazing Grace.
[1:24] Amazing
[1:27] grace,
[1:29] how sweet
[1:32] does
[1:35] that [music and singing] say
[1:38] a rich [music]
[1:40] like me?
[1:45] [music]
[1:46] I [singing] once
[1:49] was lost
[1:51] but now
[1:54] I'm found.
[1:57] I was [music] mine
[2:00] but now
[2:02] [music and singing] what? And the last
[2:04] verse
[2:07] [music] when we've
[2:10] been [singing] there
[2:13] 10,000
[2:16] years
[2:18] bright shineing
[2:21] [singing and music]
[2:22] as
[2:24] the sun
[2:27] [music]
[2:29] with no
[2:32] less days
[2:34] to sing
[2:37] God's praise
[2:40] than when
[2:43] we first
[2:45] beun.
[2:50] Thank you. You may be seated.
[2:52] Thank you all for coming. Appreciate the
[2:55] family. Appreciate it. And now, pastor
[2:58] of Tucson Tab Tabernacle, Brother Daniel
[3:01] Evans.
[3:03] Thank you.
[3:19] Good morning to everyone. I know
[3:23] sometimes it's a many times it's a
[3:26] funeral that gathers people together.
[3:30] And I know that anytime that there's a
[3:32] group of people gathered together
[3:35] in the name of the Lord Jesus, then that
[3:38] is a group that is pleasing to the Lord.
[3:40] He told us that wherever two or three
[3:42] are gathered in my name, there I will be
[3:45] in the midst of them. And we gather here
[3:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus. So, he's
[3:50] here. He's with us.
[3:54] the um the passing of our dear brother
[3:58] is um
[4:00] it is a difficult thing and I know it's
[4:03] a difficult thing for everyone for the
[4:06] family for for friends especially for
[4:08] the wife for the children for the mother
[4:12] but we do have to rest in assurance that
[4:15] this is God's will and we may think that
[4:19] how could God Lord how could you be
[4:22] maybe in our grieving. How could you be
[4:25] so cruel that you would take a young man
[4:28] like this and then leave a mom and
[4:32] children here grieving? But we have have
[4:35] to trust that God knows the end of the
[4:38] game. He knows the end of the road. And
[4:41] we have to trust that this is all to
[4:44] accomplish a task
[4:46] that has to be accomplished that will be
[4:49] better for everyone in the end. And we
[4:53] look at the the passing of of this young
[4:55] man
[4:57] and we have to trust God. Lord, this is
[5:00] your will. This was the perfect time to
[5:04] take him and he's in a better place. We
[5:08] don't have to worry about that. If if he
[5:12] wouldn't have taken him, if it wasn't
[5:15] going to be for his salvation and it
[5:18] wasn't going to be for his own benefit,
[5:19] he wouldn't have taken him. We have to
[5:21] trust God that he was a child of God.
[5:23] And and anyone that knew Gilbert knows
[5:25] he was a he was a good husband. He was
[5:27] he was a good dad. He was a good son. He
[5:29] was very respectful. In the times that I
[5:32] met him, he was one of the most
[5:34] respectful young men and uh treated me
[5:38] very um very nicely and uh he loved his
[5:43] family of talking with brother Isaac
[5:46] there and he was always with his kids.
[5:50] He was he was good and this was God's
[5:54] time to take him to bring him up to
[5:57] glory. I didn't know the brother very
[6:00] well and I was a bit concerned that what
[6:04] can I say about his life? What can I say
[6:07] about him that would be adequate? And
[6:09] really there's nothing but the one who
[6:11] is adequate to say something about his
[6:14] life is his wife Stephanie. So Stephanie
[6:17] gave me something that she wanted to
[6:20] read, but she was worried that she
[6:21] wasn't going to be able to get through
[6:23] it. So I would like to read what his
[6:25] wife wrote
[6:27] about
[6:29] Gilbert.
[6:32] Gilbert had the biggest heart and felt
[6:34] everything so deeply. He would drop
[6:37] everything just to help those he loved.
[6:40] He was always the one to put others
[6:42] needs before his own. Perhaps
[6:46] life is harder on those with such with
[6:48] such sensitivity.
[6:50] The ones who remember every word spoken,
[6:52] every facial expression, analyze body
[6:55] language or patterns. He just was born
[6:58] with the memory of an elephant. He had
[7:01] the most radiant smile,
[7:04] but it never was faked. You could only
[7:07] pull one. You could only pull one out if
[7:12] he was genuinely happy and laughing.
[7:15] He also had the best sense of humor and
[7:18] could always make me laugh. We bonded
[7:20] over comedy shows and movies.
[7:23] Gilbert was so nurturing as well. If you
[7:26] were sick, he would get the Vix vapor
[7:28] rub and place it on on our feet and
[7:30] chest. He would make soup, get medicine,
[7:34] or whatever we needed, he would get. I'm
[7:37] glad my wife's not here right now.
[7:41] I don't think I want to be held to that
[7:42] standard.
[7:45] He would get everything that we needed.
[7:48] And with every family member that he
[7:50] that passed, he was there to comfort me.
[7:53] For every nightmare I had, he was there
[7:56] to hold me. For every fear I had about
[7:59] change, he would tell me, "Everything
[8:03] is going to be okay." And it is,
[8:06] Stephanie. Everything's going to be
[8:07] okay. Gilbert had the most raw and
[8:10] genuine personality. You could never be
[8:12] confused on how he was feeling because
[8:14] he was just so straightforward about
[8:16] things. He could befriend anyone, and I
[8:19] mean anyone.
[8:22] The man knew how to talk. And for that
[8:25] gift, he would he could communicate and
[8:28] come off personable and relatable to
[8:30] anyone he met. Over the years of his
[8:33] life, he has made many friends
[8:36] and never was he judgmental to any of
[8:40] their situations.
[8:42] Amen. He had a great amount of
[8:44] compassion and always wanted to help.
[8:47] Lastly, his love for me and his kids was
[8:52] boundless.
[8:54] I know life without him will never be
[8:56] the same. We were going we were together
[8:59] for 17 years which he would boastingly
[9:02] say is over half of his age.
[9:05] We had our own secret sign language to
[9:08] communicate with each other. Later, as
[9:11] time went by, Gilbert was able to read
[9:13] my body language and facial expression
[9:15] and know exactly how I was feeling or
[9:17] what I was about to say. We were like
[9:20] ying and yang, complete opposites, but
[9:23] we completed each other each each other.
[9:26] And with all the flaws we witnessed
[9:28] within each other, we chose to keep
[9:30] fighting and keep loving each other.
[9:33] Gilbert Valenuela,
[9:35] you were enough for me. You are my best
[9:38] friend, and I will forever and always
[9:40] love you. He could hold any instrument
[9:44] and just instinctively know how to play
[9:46] it. He could just hear each note and he
[9:48] had a natural god-given talent. He would
[9:51] serenade me often and create his own
[9:54] music. And he could cook. He loved to go
[9:58] into the kitchen and just experiment
[10:01] with everything, food and drinks and ice
[10:03] cream. He would pull random ingredients
[10:04] and make a delicious soup.
[10:07] He would mix
[10:11] sham shamoy
[10:14] shamoy water
[10:18] tag and I'm really glad my wife's not
[10:20] here because I don't especially don't
[10:22] want to be expected to cook
[10:24] and tuning lemon and who knows what else
[10:27] to make delicious drink. He would dip
[10:29] fruit popsicles in shamoy and sprinkle
[10:33] tajun on top. I can't pronounce it, but
[10:37] you know what it is.
[10:40] White boy up here trying to.
[10:43] He was able to go to San Diego twice, go
[10:46] to the lake with his friends, camped
[10:48] with his mom's side and my side and his
[10:51] friends. He loved the outdoors and
[10:54] animals. He always wanted to go to
[10:56] Alaska and own a place out there away
[10:59] from the busy world.
[11:01] But Stephanie wrote about her beloved
[11:03] partner
[11:05] Gilbert. And you can tell the love
[11:08] coming from what was written. I'd like
[11:11] to
[11:13] mention
[11:14] uh something very important with a
[11:16] funeral. In fact, I think it's the most
[11:17] important thing. We honor those that are
[11:20] gone on. And the cliche saying is that
[11:25] well, you'll see them again or they are
[11:27] in a better place. The reason that we
[11:29] can say that is because of our Lord and
[11:33] Savior Jesus Christ. And that's why we
[11:36] have a promise. If we don't know him, we
[11:39] don't have that promise. But if we do
[11:42] know him, then it is a promise that will
[11:45] hold stronger than anything else in the
[11:47] world. You can count on it. You can
[11:49] bring that to the bank. It will not
[11:51] fail. I want to talk about another young
[11:54] man in the Bible
[11:56] who also died
[12:00] as as young maybe the same age as
[12:03] Gilbert was. That man's name is Lazarus
[12:06] and he was a close friend of our Lord
[12:09] Jesus.
[12:11] Jesus was out with his disciples
[12:15] and they received word from Lazarus's
[12:17] family that hey, your friend is sick.
[12:20] would you come would you come to to the
[12:24] family and and and help him? And Jesus
[12:28] kind of ignored the invitation to come
[12:32] and and visit his friend. Well, his
[12:34] friend got lower and lower
[12:38] and then Jesus made this statement in
[12:41] the book of John chap 11. Jesus said
[12:43] this.
[12:45] He said, "This sickness," speaking of
[12:48] Lazarus, he says, "This sickness is not
[12:52] unto death,
[12:54] but for the glory of God, that the son
[12:56] of God may be glorified in that." So
[12:58] Jesus is saying that his friend's death
[13:01] is not going to result his friend's
[13:03] sickness is not going to result in
[13:05] death.
[13:07] It's going to be it's going to result in
[13:09] something greater. It's going to result
[13:11] in something to be celebrated
[13:14] and not mourn over. And while Lazarus
[13:18] was getting sicker and sicker, Lazarus
[13:21] eventually died.
[13:25] And Jesus is just a few hours few hours
[13:28] away.
[13:30] And the disciples and where they were,
[13:33] they didn't know that Lazarus had died.
[13:37] And Jesus is talking to his disciples
[13:41] and they they may have mentioned,"Well,
[13:43] what about Lazarus? You know, are we
[13:45] going to go see him?" And and Jesus
[13:47] tells his disciples, "Lazarus is
[13:48] sleeping." And they're like, "Oh, good.
[13:51] That's good. You know, he's getting some
[13:53] rest." And and and Jesus says, "No, you
[13:55] don't understand.
[13:57] Lazarus is dead."
[14:00] And then they get on their road and and
[14:03] they go to visit the family at the
[14:06] funeral like we are here now.
[14:11] Now read
[14:13] some of this in the Bible. It says this.
[14:17] These things he said
[14:19] Jesus is talking about Jesus. These
[14:22] things he said that and after he he said
[14:24] that to them he said our friend Lazarus
[14:27] sleeps but I go that I may wake him and
[14:32] his disciples said Lord if he sleeps it
[14:34] he will get well. However Jesus spoke of
[14:36] his death but they thought that he was
[14:39] speaking about taking rest and sleep.
[14:42] Then Jesus said unto them plainly
[14:43] Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your
[14:46] sakes that I was not there. This is a
[14:49] key key verse. I'm glad that that I
[14:52] wasn't there so that you can believe.
[14:56] Nevertheless, let us go to him. So God
[14:59] is going to use the death of this young
[15:01] man to help others who believe in Jesus.
[15:03] To help others believe in Jesus
[15:06] because he says so that you may also
[15:08] believe.
[15:09] And I can say the same with Gilbert. I
[15:12] pray today that Gilbert may use this
[15:16] death
[15:18] so that others might believe in Jesus.
[15:24] So Jesus goes and and he meets Martha
[15:28] there.
[15:29] Martha comes out to greet him and and he
[15:32] consoles her and he and he and he says
[15:34] that your brother is going to rise
[15:36] again. And Martha says,"I know that he
[15:39] will rise again in the resurrection."
[15:41] And Jesus says to her, listen to this.
[15:45] Jesus says, 'I am the resurrection and
[15:47] the life. He who believes in me, though
[15:49] he may die, he shall live. And whosoever
[15:54] lives and believes and believes in me
[15:57] shall never die.
[16:02] Then he says this, and I asked the
[16:03] congregation.
[16:06] whosoever believes in me shall never go
[16:09] never die. Do you believe this?
[16:14] And I asked the congregation today, do
[16:17] you believe it? That he who believes in
[16:19] Jesus shall never die.
[16:22] Then Martha's sister Mary
[16:25] comes out to meet Jesus and she's really
[16:28] upset as you can imagine.
[16:30] Then when Mary came where Jesus was and
[16:32] saw him, she fell down at his feet
[16:34] saying, "Lord, if you had been here, my
[16:37] brother would not have died."
[16:40] So how could Jesus,
[16:44] if he is God, how could Jesus just allow
[16:48] this young man like this to pass away
[16:50] and leave his family? The question in
[16:53] Mary's mind was a question that all of
[16:55] us might wonder. Lord, how could how
[16:58] could you do this to me? How could you
[17:01] take this man who seemed to be wonderful
[17:04] and and and we've heard Stephanie's
[17:07] testimony of him. He was he was great.
[17:09] How could you take him and how could you
[17:11] leave me here? Well, Jesus has a purpose
[17:14] here with Lazarus with the passing of
[17:17] Lazarus. Remember in verse four that I
[17:18] said he said, "This sickness is not
[17:21] leading to death." But then he died.
[17:25] How can Jesus say that this situation of
[17:27] the death of this young man is is not
[17:30] it's not about death but really it is
[17:33] about life
[17:36] and somehow today
[17:40] we see this scenario of Lazarus and his
[17:42] death up until this point
[17:46] and all of us [snorts] should put
[17:48] ourselves in that situation this morning
[17:51] when you heard maybe that Gilbert was in
[17:55] was in trouble. Esther texted me
[17:59] um or I believe it was uh
[18:03] Elizabeth Garrett texted me and said,
[18:06] "Go to prayer
[18:08] because Gilbert um Gilbert's in a
[18:11] serious situation. He had a heart attack
[18:13] and then I talked to you a little while
[18:15] afterwards." Well, where were you when
[18:17] all this happened? Where did you where
[18:19] did you hear this?
[18:21] And then this turn of events starts
[18:25] and then we hear or maybe you were
[18:27] there. We hear that the young man had
[18:31] passed away.
[18:33] And then we go through the week as the
[18:36] as the disciples were in their journeys
[18:38] and and what they were doing. All of us,
[18:41] we go through this week and we're
[18:42] thinking about Gilbert and we're missing
[18:44] him and and maybe we're weeping and
[18:45] we're mourning and and this is all
[18:47] leading up to a point as with the
[18:49] disciples. They they went to the grave
[18:51] of Lazarus. This was all leading up to
[18:53] something very special. And for us, this
[18:56] past week has been leading up to
[18:58] something very special and leading up to
[18:59] this very day right here where we are
[19:02] individuals. All of you have a walk that
[19:04] you have walked this past week leading
[19:07] to this very point.
[19:10] And this point could be a moment not of
[19:15] mourning
[19:16] but it could be a point of great joy.
[19:22] Remember Jesus said this sickness is not
[19:24] un to death unto death but for the glory
[19:27] of God that the son of God might be
[19:29] glorified through this.
[19:32] It's the same with Gilbert.
[19:34] This sickness and this death what
[19:36] happened? It is not about death.
[19:40] It is about that we would be able to
[19:42] rejoice in something great that Jesus is
[19:44] doing.
[19:47] Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping,
[19:49] speaking of Martha or Mary, and the Jews
[19:51] who came with her weeping, he groaned in
[19:55] the spirit and was troubled.
[19:58] Remember Jesus already said, he said
[20:01] earlier that Lazarus is just sleeping.
[20:03] And I didn't read this part. He said
[20:05] that I'm going to go wake him.
[20:08] And now even Jesus is mourning the loss
[20:10] of his friend. Even though he knows he's
[20:12] going to rise again, even though we know
[20:14] that Gilbert's going to rise again, we
[20:16] know that we're going to see him again,
[20:17] we still can mourn. Jesus Christ, God in
[20:20] flesh, mourned the loss of his his
[20:22] friend. So it's not bad that we're sad.
[20:24] It's not bad that that these emotions
[20:27] are coming out. That's fine. That's
[20:29] normal. Even God in flesh did it.
[20:33] And they said, 'Lord,
[20:35] and then uh Jesus, he groaned in his
[20:37] spirit and he was troubled and he said,
[20:38] 'Where have you laid him? And they said
[20:41] to him, Lord, come and see. And then
[20:44] Jesus wept.
[20:48] The Jews said, "Look, see how he loved
[20:50] him." And one of them said, "Could not
[20:53] this man who opened the eyes of the
[20:54] blind also have kept this man from
[20:56] dying?"
[20:59] They're looking at Jesus. It's like,
[21:01] "I've seen him raise the dead. I've seen
[21:03] him give eye give sight to the blind.
[21:05] Well, why didn't he heal our loved one?
[21:10] When I prayed for him, maybe Sister
[21:11] Esther, when you prayed for him or or
[21:13] sister Stephanie, when you prayed for
[21:14] him, why didn't he raise him up?
[21:18] And it's easy. That's an easy question
[21:19] to ask. And that's what was asked here.
[21:22] Then Jesus again groaning in himself
[21:27] came to the tomb. It was a cave and a
[21:30] stone lay against it. And Jesus said,
[21:33] "Take away the stone."
[21:37] Then Martha, the sister of him who was
[21:38] dead, said, 'Lord,
[21:40] by this time there's a stench, for he's
[21:42] been dead for 4 days. And Jesus said to
[21:45] her, "Did I not say to you that if you
[21:48] believe, you will see the glory of God?"
[21:52] Then they took away the stone from the
[21:53] place where the dead man was laying. And
[21:55] Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,
[21:57] "Father, I thank you that you have heard
[21:59] me and I know that you always hear me,
[22:02] but because of the people who are
[22:04] standing by, I said this that they may
[22:08] believe that you sent me." So he's
[22:10] saying right here, this whole thing is
[22:12] because not of La because of Lazarus and
[22:15] not because of Gilbert. This whole thing
[22:17] is for all of us.
[22:21] Gilbert's in a better place.
[22:23] He's not worried about us right now.
[22:26] We're the one worried.
[22:28] But because of the people who are
[22:30] standing by, I said this that they may
[22:34] believe you sent me the father. Jesus
[22:38] speaking to the father saying, "Lord,
[22:39] this is this is about why I came to the
[22:42] earth."
[22:44] Now when he had said these things, he
[22:46] cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come
[22:48] forth." And he who had died came out
[22:52] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[22:55] and his face was wrapped with a cloth.
[22:58] Jesus said to them, "Loose him and let
[23:00] him go."
[23:03] Imagine
[23:05] that God took the death of this young
[23:09] man and turned it into a testimony to
[23:13] lead souls to Christ.
[23:17] In Jesus's very words again, I'll read
[23:19] it again. Father, I thank you that you
[23:21] have heard me. And I know that you
[23:23] always hear me because of the people who
[23:26] are standing by. I said that they may
[23:29] believe that you sent me.
[23:33] The passing of Gilbert
[23:36] is so
[23:39] that we that there are people here in
[23:41] this congregation that they might
[23:43] believe that that God is real, that
[23:45] Jesus is real, and that this opportunity
[23:50] is for me to make a decision in my life
[23:54] that I will follow this man, Jesus
[23:57] Christ. Don't worry about the churches.
[24:00] Don't worry about all the all the
[24:02] negative that you might see in
[24:03] Christianity. Don't worry about that
[24:05] because there is a real Christianity.
[24:08] There is a real Jesus Christ that is
[24:10] alive and that wants us to come to him.
[24:14] And then with him comes promises. Yes,
[24:17] I'll see Gilbert again, but that's not
[24:19] the best promise. Yes, I will see my
[24:21] loved ones again that have passed passed
[24:23] me on, but that's not the best promise.
[24:25] Yes, my family, although we may be
[24:27] united now, we will be united for
[24:29] eternity. But that's not the best
[24:30] promise. The best promise is that we
[24:32] will be in the presence of our savior
[24:36] for eternity.
[24:39] And where he wherever he is, we're safe.
[24:42] And there is joy wherever he is. There's
[24:45] liberty wherever Jesus is. There's peace
[24:49] wherever Jesus is.
[24:51] And friends, as I close, please
[24:56] Think about what's happened over these
[24:59] past few days from the death of Gilbert
[25:04] to this point. And walk yourself through
[25:08] what has happened as the disciples did.
[25:12] They say, "Oh, we were here. We heard
[25:13] the news. Then we were over here. We
[25:15] heard the news again. And then we came
[25:17] back. And now we are at the funeral. And
[25:19] now God wants to do something that's
[25:21] greater than anything in the world,
[25:24] which is to give me eternal life, which
[25:27] is to bring life. He brought life to
[25:29] Lazarus when he came out of the tomb,
[25:30] but it wasn't as important as as what we
[25:33] are here today because you know what?
[25:34] Lazarus died again.
[25:37] He got old and he died.
[25:40] But he had a promise to live eternally.
[25:44] And we have that promise. So please
[25:47] friends, consider consider the
[25:49] importance of this funeral. Consider the
[25:52] importance of what's happened over the
[25:55] past few days and consider giving your
[25:59] heart, your life to Jesus Christ. It's
[26:03] not about, well, I got to give up this
[26:06] and I got to give up that and if I'm
[26:08] going to be a Christian, I got to stop
[26:09] doing this and stop doing that. Don't
[26:11] worry about those things.
[26:14] Set those things aside.
[26:16] All Jesus wants is for you to come to
[26:18] him
[26:20] and say, "Lord, I come to you and I am
[26:22] full of flaws. I'm full of faults. I'm
[26:26] full of sins."
[26:28] But imagine,
[26:30] Sister Stephanie, imagine if your kids
[26:33] came to you and said, "Mom, I've done
[26:36] this wrong and this wrong and this
[26:37] wrong, and I'm sorry." Said, "Come here,
[26:39] sweetheart.
[26:41] Come here, my son. Come here, my
[26:42] daughter. That's okay. It's why I'm
[26:44] Jesus.
[26:46] That's why I'm That's why I'm called the
[26:48] savior.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; I can take those sins. I just want you
[26:52] to come to me. I'll take the other stuff
[26:54] on myself. You just come to me.
[26:58] For those of you who haven't made that
[27:00] decision and and those of you that have
[27:02] made that decision, all of us here,
[27:06] every person present, please consider
[27:10] the purpose
[27:12] of this loss that we have lost and
[27:16] consider that this could be the greatest
[27:19] blessing that you have ever received in
[27:22] your whole life because it could mean a
[27:25] change in your life where now Sorrow
[27:30] can be replaced by joy. Sorrow of losing
[27:33] someone. Jesus mourned. It's okay.
[27:36] That's part of it. We should mourn.
[27:39] But there will be joy with that
[27:41] mourning. There will be happiness with
[27:43] that mourning. There it's like, Lord,
[27:46] here I am. I wish I could have seen
[27:49] Lazarus come out of that grave. I wish I
[27:51] could have been there. But the same
[27:53] Jesus Christ, he said, I am the same
[27:55] yesterday and today and forever. The
[27:57] same Jesus that was there is the same
[28:00] Jesus that can touch you and in your
[28:04] life. Just come to him. Bring your sins.
[28:07] Bring them with you and say, "Lord, here
[28:10] they are."
[28:12] And he says, "Listen, sweetheart. Come
[28:13] here. I love you. Don't worry about
[28:16] those. Just come to me." Jesus said, and
[28:20] I'll close with this, and I I don't know
[28:22] what is the next on the order of
[28:23] service, but I I'll close with this.
[28:26] that
[28:29] Jesus said,
[28:31] "Come to me
[28:34] all you that labor and are heavy laden.
[28:38] Come to me all you that are working and
[28:42] you're carrying a heavy load." And he
[28:44] said, "And I will give you rest."
[28:47] Consider it friends. Amen. Let's sing
[28:50] Amazing Grace there.
[28:53] Amazing
[29:06] [singing] grace,
[29:09] how sweet

[29:50] done by Jacob Valencia. I'm sorry,
[29:52] Valenuela.
[29:54] Somebody printed this really, really
[29:56] small.
[29:58] So, here you
[30:12] like to thank you all for coming and
[30:14] honoring my nephew
[30:16] Gilberella
[30:19] survived by his spouse Stephanie Cortas
[30:23] and his three children Sarah Grayson
[30:26] Nimalia
[30:29] and also by his father Ger Venuela and
[30:32] his mother's Esther Gar and his brother
[30:36] Jared Vanella
[30:39] and he was a beautiful person and
[30:42] he was um he felt like a son to me you
[30:44] know I I've um ever since he was a baby,
[30:47] I remember holding him, feeling, you
[30:50] know, smelling his skin, giving him a
[30:51] bath, taking him for walks, teaching him
[30:54] play piano, you know, he's super
[30:56] talented and um
[30:59] he's always demonstrated that all
[31:00] throughout his life, but he also had a
[31:03] huge heart and uh and he always wanted
[31:07] what was best. You know, he tried really
[31:09] hard for his family. He loved his kids
[31:12] and often we would get together and you
[31:15] know he bring his kids along with us. We
[31:17] go out to the he loved the outdoors and
[31:19] the wilderness and we go on hikes and
[31:21] hang out and with all the boys, you
[31:23] know, do the boy stuff and
[31:26] we had some so many good times together
[31:30] and and um I've always been impressed
[31:32] with him and
[31:34] you know I would we talk a lot on the
[31:36] phone, you know, and share our problems
[31:38] and share our joys as well and and he's
[31:41] super intelligent, you know, and he a
[31:43] lot of times I find myself asking him
[31:45] questions, you know, what do you think
[31:46] about this? what do you think about
[31:46] this? And he would he would talk to
[31:48] uncle be careful. Don't don't don't
[31:51] think about that too much. It's not good
[31:52] for you. You know, and um and he was
[31:55] very religious too. You know, we we talk
[31:57] for hours and we start getting to you
[32:00] know, scripture and and you know, times
[32:03] that we had with our family, you know,
[32:05] he respected and loved his grandparents
[32:07] very much and they set such a great
[32:09] example for all of us and for him as
[32:11] well. And then he remembered the
[32:13] teachings my dad would, you know, teach
[32:16] and and share with him and growing up.
[32:18] And um and so you know we found a lot of
[32:21] realizations and
[32:24] talking about just the times and you
[32:27] know and the examples we had growing up
[32:30] and
[32:32] but u yeah it's him and Jared and my
[32:34] brother Joseph and we're all closer in
[32:37] age so we we had a lot of time hanging
[32:39] out together and
[32:42] and he was he was such a talented you
[32:45] know and I had asked uh Steph if you
[32:47] know if she want to say something
[32:49] because so Evans took all my words
[32:52] because I was going to share what Steph
[32:53] said but I said that's beautiful. I
[32:55] said, you know, that's exactly what Nate
[32:57] was. You know, he [clears throat] had a
[32:58] huge heart. He had a memory like an
[33:00] elephant. He was incredible. I would
[33:02] teach him a song and, you know, by by
[33:04] road and he would just memorize
[33:06] everything and he would continue
[33:07] playing. He had such good sensibilities
[33:10] and until recently we were, you know, I
[33:12] told him, "Hey, you want to start a rea
[33:13] band?" And he said, "Yeah, love rea."
[33:15] So, I was like, "Okay, let's do this."
[33:17] You know, but he was so much fun to hang
[33:19] around with and I'm going to miss him as
[33:22] I'm sure many of you will.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[33:33] &gt;&gt; I just thank God for our family and for
[33:36] all the support that we've had and I
[33:38] think all of you as well for showing
[33:39] your support we the last week we've all
[33:42] been spending time with each other and I
[33:44] think it's really important that we
[33:45] stick together and you know help each
[33:47] other lean on each other cry on each
[33:49] other it's healthy it's good for you and
[33:52] I think this helped I don't think I'd be
[33:54] able to be up here if it wasn't for that
[33:55] and for hanging out with Jared and and
[33:57] having these long nights of, you know,
[33:59] talking and talking about all the great
[34:01] things that we experienced with with
[34:03] Nate, good and bad. I mean, we it was he
[34:06] was just a special soul, you know, and I
[34:08] think everybody realized that, you know,
[34:10] his friends and family, everybody saw
[34:12] that in him. He was such a strong
[34:13] person. He had a strong backbone, you
[34:15] know, and he did he stood up to
[34:17] everything, you know, and he's he's uh
[34:22] and so I just I want to thank every I
[34:24] want to thank my family for all your
[34:25] support cuz this is it was really
[34:26] difficult to lose someone like like
[34:28] Nate.
[34:31] He's one of a kind.
[34:34] We're going to miss him. I love you,
[34:35] Nate.
[34:38] until we see each other again.
[34:43] Oh, thank you.

[34:57] their instruments. The title of the song
[34:59] is Messiah. So, we put everything way
[35:02] past beyond the sun. But God said, "I'll

[50:40] is before me.
[50:43] I can only imagine [singing]
[50:50] &gt;&gt; surrounded [music]
[50:51] by [singing] your glory.
[50:53] What will my heart feel? [singing] Will
[50:56] I dance for you, Jesus? [music]
[50:59] or in all of you be still. Will I stand
[51:03] [singing and music]
[51:04] in your presence or to my knees will I
[51:07] fall? Will I sing [singing and music]
[51:10] hallelujah?
[51:11] Will I be able to speak it all? I can
[51:14] only imagine. [singing]
[51:20] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine. [singing]
[51:26] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine. [singing]
[51:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[51:30] &gt;&gt; When that day comes
[51:33] and I find myself
[51:36] [music] standing [singing] in the sun, I
[51:39] can only imagine
[51:42] when all [singing] I will do
[51:45] is forever
[51:48] forever worship [music] you. I can only
[51:52] imagine.
[51:56] Oh, [music and singing] surrounded by
[51:59] your glory, but will my heart feel. Will
[52:03] I dance [music] for [singing] you,
[52:05] Jesus? Or in all of you, be still. Will

[52:25] Oh, I [music] can only imagine.
[52:27] [singing]
[52:33] [music and singing] Surrounded by your
[52:34] glory. What will my heart feel? Will I

[53:01] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine. [singing and music]
[53:07] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine. [singing]
[53:11] When all I will do
[53:14] is forever,
[53:16] forever worship you.
[53:20] I can only imagine. [singing]
[53:38] Can only imagine.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Just make sure you're there that day and
[53:42] it won't be an imagination anymore, but
[53:44] it'll be a reality.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And he makes an invite to you. Come,
[53:50] come. He says, I will receive you. You
[53:53] don't have to be perfect to come to him
[53:58] &gt;&gt; because none of us could come if we
[54:00] were, but if you'll come to him, he'll
[54:02] take care of situations.
[54:05] Now, as we we come to the end here
[54:09] and um
[54:12] again, I would say thank you as part of
[54:14] the family. All the family appreciates
[54:16] you being here showing your support,
[54:19] your love.
[54:21] But it doesn't end today.
[54:24] As many as as you can, as you often as
[54:26] you can remember them, greet them, lift
[54:31] them up, be a friend to them.
[54:34] So
[54:38] as we just let's just close our eyes and
[54:40] just and sometimes you have somebody
[54:43] leading the prayer but you pray too.
[54:47] You give your prayers towards a family
[54:49] and just ask God to
[54:52] to keep this day. Lord, as as we as we
[54:56] come to a finish here to an end
[55:01] and remembering this young man, part of
[55:04] the family and hearing the tribute that
[55:09] was given to him and to the family.
[55:11] Lord, it's it's it's good to hear the
[55:14] good things, the wonderful things,
[55:18] and that's just because you're good to
[55:19] us, Lord.
[55:22] But now as as [music] the days go on and
[55:24] the memories come back and
[55:27] times get hard, Lord, let us take time
[55:30] to reach out to one another.
[55:33] Encourage
[55:36] especially the family in this day, in
[55:37] this hour, Lord. And if anyone here,
[55:41] Lord, that has heard something about you
[55:43] that's made [music] their heart want to
[55:45] desire to know you, may they just ask.
[55:49] Ask someone who knows you and let us
[55:52] share that with them. The God that's
[55:55] alive, the same Jesus that spoke to
[55:58] Lazarus said, "Come out. You're still
[56:02] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[56:04] Lord." So, we just want to say, [music]
[56:07] "Thank you for being mindful of the
[56:09] family."
[56:11] And Lord, may we be able to be with them
[56:13] and strengthen them, encourage them,
[56:15] Lord, in this time as they go through,
[56:17] Lord, as we commit the rest of this day
[56:20] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:23] Christ.
[56:25] The head of finishing song is when we
[56:28] all get to heaven.
[56:31] If you'll stand, we'll sing that
[56:32] together.
[56:34] You'll leave that there. Thank you.
[56:39] Sing the wondous [music and singing]
[56:43] love of Jesus.
[56:47] Sing his mercy
[56:51] and his [music]
[56:53] [singing] grace
[56:55] in the manions
[56:59] bright [music]
[57:00] and blessed.
[57:03] will prepare for us a place
[57:10] when we [music] all
[57:13] get to heaven. [singing]
[57:17] What a day of rejoicing [music]
[57:20] that [singing] will be
[57:24] when we [music] all
[57:27] see Jesus
[57:31] will sing and shout the victory.
[57:39] While we [singing] walk [music]
[57:41] the pilgrim
[57:44] pathway,
[57:45] clouds will [music]
[57:47] over
[57:49] spread the sky.
[57:52] But [music] when traveling
[57:55] days are over,
[57:59] not a shadow, [music]
[58:01] not a sigh.
[58:04] Oh, when we all [singing]
[58:07] get to heaven,
[58:11] what a day of rejoicing
[58:14] [music and singing] that will be
[58:17] when we all
[58:21] see Jesus. [singing]
[58:24] will sing and shout the victory
[58:30] when we all [singing]
[58:34] get to heaven.
[58:36] [music]
[58:37] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[58:43] when [music] we all
[58:47] see Jesus.
[58:50] will sing and [music and singing] shout
[58:53] the victory.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Main thing is let's make sure
[58:59] we're there
[59:00] &gt;&gt; when we all get to heaven. That means
[59:02] everybody here, let's make sure we all
[59:04] get there and that we are all able to
[59:06] sing and shout the victory when we get
[59:08] there. Now friends, we've honored our
[59:12] brother
[59:14] and I hope that as you leave today, I
[59:18] hope that something that was said will
[59:20] make you think
[59:24] and ask the Lord, Lord, am I right with
[59:26] you?
[59:28] Is my soul right with you, Lord? And
[59:31] when we do, when we all get to heaven,
[59:33] Lord, am I going to be there?
[59:36] And if there's something in your heart
[59:39] that you see that is preventing you from
[59:42] being there, we have ministers here. We
[59:44] have brother Aaron here. I'm here.
[59:48] Make sure, friends, don't let it go.
[59:50] Don't let it rest until you make that
[59:53] decision. And then once you make that
[59:55] decision to follow Jesus, then you have
[59:57] a promise. Lord, I'm going to be there.
[1:00:00] God bless you. Please, as brother Aaron
[1:00:02] said, don't forget the family.
[1:00:04] we're going to they'll get through this
[1:00:06] day and then there is going to be a void
[1:00:08] in their life forever now until we get
[1:00:12] to the other side and until we meet this
[1:00:15] lost loved one uh not lost from the Lord
[1:00:19] but lost from our immediate uh presence.
[1:00:23] So make sure to pray for the family.
[1:00:25] Make sure to reach out to the family in
[1:00:26] the future because they're going to need
[1:00:28] you. As I said, there's a void there.
[1:00:31] Let's fill that void. All right,
[1:00:33] friends. God bless you. We [music] have
[1:00:35] we have food afterwards. Let's bow our
[1:00:38] heads one more time. Father,
[1:00:40] we ask that your blessings are dressed
[1:00:42] upon the food that we're going to take.
[1:00:44] And then once again, Lord, that you
[1:00:46] would bless the family. Bless Stephanie.
[1:00:50] Lord, strengthen her. Lord, may the
[1:00:53] presence that is missing in her life be
[1:00:56] replaced by the presence of the Holy
[1:00:58] Spirit comforting her and guiding her.
[1:01:00] Bless the children.
[1:01:03] May the Holy Spirit as they get older,
[1:01:07] may it guide them, protect them, and be
[1:01:10] with them. Bless the mom, sister Esther,
[1:01:13] father, be with her, be with the dad.
[1:01:15] And Lord, we pray that your blessings as
[1:01:19] would rest upon the food and upon the
[1:01:21] remainder of the day. And Lord, we love
[1:01:24] you and we thank you for all that you do
[1:01:26] for us in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[1:01:29] you. You're dismissed. You're welcome to
[1:01:32] greet the family here and uh and the
[1:01:34] food if you go out through the back door
[1:01:36] there probably where you came in. The
[1:01:38] fellowship hall is right on the other
[1:01:40] side of the wall here. God bless you.
