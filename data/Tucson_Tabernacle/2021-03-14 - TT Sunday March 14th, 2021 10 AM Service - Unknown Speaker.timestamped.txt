[30:50] morning just each one of you that's here
[30:52] i
[30:53] didn't get anything wrote down
[30:54] specifically but i know my
[30:56] cousin zachary and hannah wallace are
[30:58] here with their family it's good to have
[30:59] them
[31:01] i believe sister hannah i've asked you
[31:03] to sing a song special if you're
[31:05] available this morning so if you could
[31:07] just make your way now
[31:08] i'm going to read a praise i've
[31:09] neglected to get this to brother aaron
[31:11] he's going to do the prayer requests but
[31:13] i got this sent to me this morning and
[31:15] i neglected to send it to him so i'm
[31:17] going to read this praise that she comes
[31:18] and makes ready
[31:20] this is from brother david hakami he
[31:22] says dear saints just over a week ago
[31:24] while driving north on i-19 between
[31:26] amato and green valley at 75 miles per
[31:29] hour i struck a rock or concrete block
[31:30] about the size of a five gallon bucket
[31:32] i was behind a vehicle in the left lane
[31:34] and switched to the right lane
[31:36] as soon as i turned into the right lane
[31:38] the obstruction appeared
[31:39] traveling at 75 miles per hour i knew if
[31:41] i tried to avoid it i would overturn the
[31:43] car
[31:44] with both hands on the steering wheel i
[31:45] accepted what was to come next
[31:47] after the hit i quickly looked in the
[31:49] rearview mirror and saw the
[31:50] obstruction explode in many directions
[31:53] the rest
[31:54] area was ahead so i pulled to the side
[31:56] of the highway limping along until i got
[31:58] there
[31:59] the right front had a bubble on the edge
[32:01] and the right rear
[32:02] back tire had a hole in it about the
[32:04] size of a half dollar
[32:05] there's a small dent under the right
[32:07] passenger door so i'll know
[32:09] so i will not ever forget this life
[32:11] experience
[32:12] after taking out the spare tire i picked
[32:14] up the car i jacked up the car and
[32:16] pulled off
[32:16] the blown-out tire a young man came
[32:18] behind me and offered to help
[32:20] without giving him a response he
[32:22] immediately grabbed the spare tire put
[32:24] on the lug nuts then returned it to his
[32:26] parents car
[32:27] i always changed my tires myself but i
[32:29] recognized this eagerness to help and
[32:31] truthfully welcomed his offer
[32:33] then while driving home with a thump
[32:35] thump sound i noticed that the rear
[32:37] the right rear hub was tilted inward
[32:39] repairs have been made to the vehicle
[32:40] and i have no injuries
[32:42] i have the full confidence that my lord
[32:44] is with me even
[32:45] in me i give thanks to my lord daily
[32:49] he constantly helps me this was an
[32:52] accident very bad things could have
[32:53] happened
[32:54] but they didn't and he kept me from real
[32:56] danger thanks be
[32:57] to god amen
[33:02] you know my sister-in-law was driving
[33:03] yesterday in louisiana
[33:06] and she noticed a car was coming down
[33:08] the freeway pretty fast and then all of
[33:09] a sudden came across
[33:11] the median and she swerved
[33:14] and missed the car but the car head-on
[33:17] collision with the car right behind her
[33:19] and she just thanks the lord that it
[33:22] wasn't more serious for her and
[33:24] fortunately nobody died but she could
[33:25] have been right there
[33:27] right there at the head-on collision so
[33:29] the lord is gracious and mercy
[33:30] full to all of us amen god bless you
[33:40] when i first
[33:43] began to walk
[33:47] with the lord i did not fully
[33:52] trust him
[33:57] but how he longed for
[34:01] me to understand
[34:06] that i could
[34:12] so through the valley
[34:17] he led me
[34:21] afraid as i
[34:24] could be
[34:27] until i felt
[34:30] his loving arms
[34:35] embracing me
[34:42] and i've been through enough to know
[34:46] he'll be enough
[34:49] for me
[34:56] he's come through too many times
[34:59] and that puts my mind at
[35:02] ease for
[35:06] good and i'll take my very life that
[35:13] he's going to
[35:15] take care of me
[35:21] [Music]
[35:23] you see i've been through enough to know
[35:27] he'll be enough for
[35:31] me
[35:38] how could i ever
[35:42] doubt whose hands hold the
[35:48] universe
[35:52] how could i ever
[35:56] question his ability
[36:06] see there's no place that i
[36:09] could go where my god
[36:13] doesn't know the things that
[36:17] trouble me
[36:20] he's always aware of
[36:25] where i am and
[36:28] what i need
[36:34] you see i've been through enough to know
[36:39] he'll be
[36:40] enough for me
[36:43] [Music]
[36:48] he's come through too many times
[36:51] and that puts my mind at ease
[36:57] for good
[37:00] and i'll stake my very life
[37:04] that he's going to take care of
[37:08] me
[37:10] [Music]
[37:14] cause i've been through enough to know
[37:18] he'll be enough
[37:21] [Music]
[37:35] true
[37:39] so nevermore will i doubt or question
[37:44] why
[37:45] cause i've seen him work before
[37:49] and i know what god can do
[37:58] i've been through enough to know
[38:02] he'll be enough
[38:05] for me
[38:07] [Music]
[38:12] he's come through too many times
[38:16] and that puts
[38:18] [Music]

[38:32] care of me
[38:39] cause i've been through enough to know

[42:38] discouraged and just walked away
[42:40] from everything and she got quite sick
[42:43] and they took her in found out she was
[42:45] diabetic and she was going through a lot
[42:46] of problems
[42:48] and she's been in a lot of chronic pain
[42:49] and not been able to do
[42:52] but the other day she asked for prayer
[42:55] and there was a time that they would
[42:57] have nothing to do with that
[42:58] but you know you get into a place where
[43:01] you realize
[43:02] that there are only one that can help
[43:04] you and you turn in your luck to him
[43:06] and i'm glad that he doesn't turn his
[43:08] back i'm glad that he's merciful and he
[43:12] knows what we need so
[43:14] you have a need say lord
[43:17] i have a need you know what that need is
[43:19] sometimes you can't even put it in words
[43:22] there's something down deep in your
[43:23] heart something that's that's
[43:25] maybe you can't even explain it but you
[43:27] know there's a need but he's that
[43:28] satisfying portion if we can believe now

[52:30] to mark the fourth chapter we'll take
[52:31] our text
[52:32] good to see my great uncle kurt brown
[52:34] here this morning god bless you
[52:37] amen we love you
[52:42] just trusting in the help of the lord
[52:43] this morning i
[52:46] i got really heavy under some fresh
[52:48] inspiration yesterday
[52:50] and it sort of changed my approach a
[52:52] little bit
[52:53] maybe we'll be a little all over the
[52:55] place maybe it won't be
[52:57] a technically perfected sermon
[53:00] but that's not what we're looking for
[53:02] we're looking for the leadership of the
[53:03] lord
[53:04] and the ministry of the holy ghost only
[53:05] god can speak the word
[53:07] and only the holy ghost can interpret it
[53:09] to our hearts but i'd like to preach
[53:11] this morning by the help of the lord on
[53:12] the prince of peace
[53:14] prince of peace of course a name and a
[53:16] title by which god is known in the
[53:17] scripture
[53:19] and there's some precious things to me
[53:21] in this subject
[53:22] mark the fourth chapter and we'll start
[53:24] at the 35th verse and just read this
[53:26] very familiar
[53:27] story from the life of jesus
[53:30] and the same day when the evening was
[53:31] come he saith unto them let us pass over
[53:34] unto the other side of course of the sea
[53:36] of galilee
[53:37] and when they had sent away the
[53:38] multitude they took him even as he was
[53:40] in the ship and there were also with him
[53:42] other little ships
[53:44] and there rose a great storm of wind and
[53:46] the waves beat into the ship
[53:48] so that it was now full and he was in
[53:51] the hinder part of this
[53:52] of the ship asleep on a pillow and they
[53:54] awake him and say unto him master
[53:57] carest thou not that we perish and he
[54:00] arose and rebuked the wind and said unto
[54:02] the sea
[54:02] peace be still and the wind ceased and
[54:06] there was a great call
[54:07] and he said unto them why are you so
[54:09] fearful how is it that you have no faith
[54:12] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[54:13] to another
[54:14] what manner of man is this that even the
[54:17] wind and the sea
[54:17] obey him amen let's just talk to the
[54:19] master of the wind this morning heavenly
[54:21] father
[54:22] we ask that you'd add your blessings to
[54:23] the reading of the word father this
[54:25] morning we just look to you
[54:26] lord in the storms of life and in a dark
[54:29] age lord when
[54:31] when there's there are many turmoils and
[54:33] much strife and
[54:35] many things on the negative side that we
[54:36] could be looking at but father
[54:38] we we don't want to get caught up in
[54:40] those things lord we want to be
[54:42] cognizant father we want to recognize
[54:44] the presence
[54:45] of the master of the wind father amongst
[54:47] the bride of jesus christ we know that
[54:49] you're present with us father
[54:50] you sent a message to reveal that to us
[54:53] and oh god we're trusting in your
[54:54] presence this morning father
[54:56] a man any any human being has nothing
[54:59] within himself to offer your people
[55:01] lord we are helpless before you father
[55:03] but not hopeless lord for
[55:05] you have promised a comforter lord an
[55:07] inside teacher which will lead us into
[55:08] all truth i pray father that thou holy
[55:10] ghost would take complete control
[55:12] lord not only anoint the speaker today
[55:14] father but anoint the ears of the
[55:16] hearers alike lord that
[55:17] that your word would come forth by
[55:19] revelation lord and it would just make a
[55:21] difference in each life for
[55:22] for we want to be a help to your people
[55:24] lord your bride
[55:26] your beloved father i pray lord that you
[55:28] would take complete control as we
[55:29] surrender ourselves we surrender our
[55:31] ideas opinions
[55:33] agendas and thoughts lord to you and
[55:35] your word
[55:36] and ask that you would have your way in
[55:38] the name of the lord jesus christ
[55:40] amen and amen god bless you as you're
[55:41] seated this morning would you turn with
[55:43] me to take our text
[55:45] uh for the for for this morning uh in
[55:48] isaiah the ninth chapter
[55:51] the prince of peace
[55:58] isaiah chapter nine and just the sixth
[56:00] and the seventh verse there another very
[56:01] familiar portion of scripture
[56:03] of course it's a prophecy of the coming
[56:05] messiah
[56:08] and isaiah says here for unto us
[56:12] a child is born a son is given
[56:16] and the government shall be upon his
[56:18] shoulder and his name shall be called
[56:19] wonderful
[56:21] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[56:25] father
[56:26] and the prince of peace of the increase
[56:29] of his government
[56:30] and peace there shall be no end upon the
[56:32] throne of david
[56:33] and upon his kingdom to order it and to
[56:35] establish it with judgment and with
[56:36] justice from henceforth even forever
[56:38] the zeal of the lord of hosts will
[56:41] perform this
[56:42] amen amen so on this thought of the
[56:45] prince of peace
[56:46] one of my favorite types of studies to
[56:48] do in the scripture
[56:50] is to take the names of god things like
[56:52] the prince of peace or
[56:54] the god of our fathers or the lord of
[56:56] hosts and things by which
[56:57] these names and these titles by which
[56:59] god makes himself known
[57:00] it's always wonderful and edifying to
[57:02] run those through the scripture
[57:04] and and put those together because when
[57:06] god is when god is giving himself a
[57:08] label or a name
[57:09] it's revealing something about his
[57:10] character of course it's uh it's it's
[57:12] showing us something about the lord that
[57:14] maybe we didn't know before like uh you
[57:17] know in the in the
[57:18] in the old times of the old testament
[57:20] everybody knew that god was god but he
[57:21] was a mysterious god
[57:23] john said no man has seen the father at
[57:25] any time we knew that he was jehovah we
[57:26] knew that he was lord but
[57:28] but we find that uh we did not know that
[57:30] he was jehovah jireh
[57:32] until abraham was in need of a ram amen
[57:34] and and so when god revealed himself to
[57:36] be a provider then abraham knew him as
[57:38] not only jehovah but jehovah jireh amen
[57:41] we didn't know that he was a healer
[57:43] until he revealed himself as a healer
[57:45] now we know that he's jehovah
[57:46] rapha he is our healer amen and so we
[57:49] find that he is also the prince of peace
[57:51] and all these names of course
[57:52] are are all the self-same person amen we
[57:54] don't believe in trinitarianism or
[57:56] or or or some manner of polytheism but
[57:59] but we believe that it's all christ and
[58:01] yet he's known by these different names
[58:02] which are revealing aspects of his
[58:04] character
[58:05] and so we know this morning that he is
[58:06] the prince of peace
[58:08] and he is a god of peace and now so we
[58:10] read this prophecy in the book of isaiah
[58:12] and and of course it's a
[58:14] it's an advent promise it's speaking of
[58:16] his coming unto us a child will be born
[58:18] amen
[58:19] the same isaiah said a virgin shall
[58:21] conceive it's a
[58:22] he's coming it's a compound prophecy he
[58:24] speaks of the son of david rain which is
[58:26] for the millennial time when he shall
[58:28] bring the world unto order and so it's
[58:30] an advent promise it's speaking that
[58:32] he's coming and when he's coming he will
[58:33] be the prince of peace whenever the
[58:35] whenever he comes whenever he appears
[58:37] whenever his advent is he brings peace
[58:39] amen because he's the prince of peace
[58:41] just like paul said in the book of
[58:43] philippians he said the lord is at hand
[58:45] see an advent and appearing a coming
[58:47] he says and be careful for nothing don't
[58:49] worry about anything
[58:51] but in everything by prayer and
[58:52] supplication with thanksgiving let your
[58:54] requests be made known unto god and the
[58:56] peace of god
[58:57] which passes all understanding shall
[59:00] keep your hearts and minds through
[59:01] christ jesus see
[59:02] the lord is at hand it's a coming it's a
[59:05] and when he's coming he's bringing peace
[59:06] when he came
[59:07] when this child was born he brought
[59:09] peace on earth it was good will toward
[59:11] men he came
[59:12] with a good message with a gospel with
[59:14] good news amen it's it's peace
[59:15] not not strife not struggle not worry
[59:18] when
[59:18] uh in his presence there is peace he's
[59:21] gonna usher in this peace now
[59:23] now uh now his peace passes our
[59:25] understanding so his peace
[59:26] is not our idea of peace it uh it does
[59:29] not it does not match our expectations
[59:31] it does not
[59:32] it does not you know many times our
[59:34] expectations are wrong and that's why we
[59:36] have no peace but if he's with us then
[59:37] we have peace amen
[59:39] but it'll be his peace and it passes our
[59:41] understanding of course
[59:42] amen it's a good news advent it's a
[59:44] shalom and we've had a shalom in our
[59:46] time it's
[59:47] we've had an appearing we have had an
[59:48] advent amen of jesus christ
[59:51] revealing himself to his bride and what
[59:52] has he brought he has brought peace he's
[59:54] brought shalom amen
[59:55] a peace that passes understanding paul
[59:57] said don't be careful for anything
[59:59] so his peace is not in relation to our
[1:00:01] cares his peace is not in relation to
[1:00:03] what you're worried about what's going
[1:00:04] on in your life the circumstances around
[1:00:06] you the circumstances around the message
[1:00:08] none of those things have any bearing
[1:00:10] on the peace of god he is the prince of
[1:00:12] peace amen but it's his peace
[1:00:14] the first thing we need to know about
[1:00:15] god's peace it has nothing to do with
[1:00:16] circumstances
[1:00:18] it has nothing to do with symptoms it
[1:00:19] has nothing to do with the stormy skies
[1:00:22] cloudy skies are not a sign of god's
[1:00:23] disapproval
[1:00:24] amen and but it's it's actually in spite
[1:00:27] of the conditions
[1:00:28] in spite of what we see around us in
[1:00:30] spite of what our mortalites are looking
[1:00:31] at he's coming with peace amen
[1:00:33] in spite of all those things and his
[1:00:35] coming is not according to our
[1:00:36] expectations
[1:00:38] in the message the world is falling
[1:00:39] apart brother branham is talking about
[1:00:40] how the how that people
[1:00:42] always turn god down because he when he
[1:00:43] comes he doesn't come according to their
[1:00:45] taste
[1:00:46] right and we know these things when he
[1:00:48] comes it's so mysterious to the world
[1:00:50] that they always miss his coming they
[1:00:51] always miss his presence because
[1:00:54] because it does not match their taste he
[1:00:55] said it's the same thing today it
[1:00:57] doesn't come in our theological taste
[1:00:59] the message was not
[1:01:00] to the taste of this world it it did not
[1:01:02] achieve the things that the world and
[1:01:04] religious powers and religious systems
[1:01:06] were looking for but it brought peace it
[1:01:08] brought a shalom amen amen but he said
[1:01:10] but it comes in the way of the power of
[1:01:12] the demonstration
[1:01:14] of the manifestation of god's promise
[1:01:15] for the age exactly but they refuse it
[1:01:18] they refused it then
[1:01:19] he said and they refuse it today because
[1:01:21] it doesn't meet the expectation of the
[1:01:23] day according
[1:01:24] to the way that people expect it amen
[1:01:27] think about the first full minute
[1:01:28] fulfillment of the of isaiah's prophecy
[1:01:30] when this child was born
[1:01:31] amen when jesus took flesh on this earth
[1:01:34] and pitched his tent with us it was a
[1:01:35] great coming it was a great advent
[1:01:37] amen the prince of peace was amongst us
[1:01:39] but but there were a lot of disappointed
[1:01:41] people amen there were a lot of people
[1:01:43] who could not receive his coming
[1:01:44] because it wasn't according to his taste
[1:01:46] the pharisees were disappointed in the
[1:01:47] coming of the lord because
[1:01:49] he didn't endorse their religion he was
[1:01:51] not in favor of their religious systems
[1:01:52] he didn't pay respect to their power
[1:01:54] structures and amen judas was
[1:01:56] disappointed because he thought that
[1:01:58] jesus would come and he would overthrow
[1:02:00] the roman rule and he would bring in
[1:02:01] zealots to power
[1:02:02] and he would bring the son of david rain
[1:02:04] on earth and he his
[1:02:05] his uh his eschatology had one idea but
[1:02:08] when
[1:02:08] god came it was totally different amen
[1:02:11] so he was disappointed the rich young
[1:02:13] ruler was disappointed in the coming of
[1:02:14] the lord because
[1:02:15] he wasn't a respecter of persons he
[1:02:17] wasn't interested in status he wasn't
[1:02:19] interested
[1:02:20] in big names and big ministries and amen
[1:02:23] and and and power structures of this
[1:02:25] world but
[1:02:26] and it seems that today there are a lot
[1:02:27] of disappointed people with a message
[1:02:29] amen a lot of people it seems have
[1:02:32] become disappointed with this end time
[1:02:33] message that we believe with all of our
[1:02:35] hearts and
[1:02:36] many people are refusing this message
[1:02:38] many people are
[1:02:40] are rejecting it because it's not
[1:02:41] according to their tastes
[1:02:43] others are becoming discouraged because
[1:02:44] they're looking at the troubles that we
[1:02:46] see around this world
[1:02:47] and and not only around the world but
[1:02:48] around the message we see
[1:02:50] you know we see we see church is falling
[1:02:52] apart we see coldness coming in we see
[1:02:54] we don't see the moving of the spirit
[1:02:56] like we used to have it we don't see the
[1:02:58] supernatural like it was promised
[1:03:00] amen we see fighting preachers
[1:03:02] skirmishing over their pulpits and
[1:03:03] firing shots and
[1:03:05] amen we see doctrinal division we see
[1:03:07] denominational spirits taking hold of
[1:03:09] men and ministries and churches
[1:03:10] and we see all of those things and it
[1:03:12] causes people to become discouraged amen
[1:03:15] amen it's caused people to to because
[1:03:17] they're looking at the great darkness of
[1:03:19] this time and they become discouraged
[1:03:21] even with god's message
[1:03:22] amen i've been preaching a lot over the
[1:03:25] last couple years about
[1:03:26] zerubbabel's temple if i could just
[1:03:28] deviate onto this thought for a moment
[1:03:30] but you know that temple of zerubbabel
[1:03:32] is a is a perfect type of
[1:03:34] of of the ministry that we've received
[1:03:36] it's a restoration time
[1:03:37] amen a man is sent with the authority of
[1:03:40] a king to restore
[1:03:41] a right form of worship to restore god's
[1:03:44] temple amen
[1:03:44] amen it's a it's a it's a beautiful type
[1:03:47] of the ministry that we've had
[1:03:48] amen by a prophet through a message in
[1:03:50] our day amen to restore a message to
[1:03:52] restore the right worship of god but in
[1:03:54] and so it was a great time amen this
[1:03:57] time of zerubbabel but you know you can
[1:03:58] read there in the scripture
[1:04:00] about how the people amen the people
[1:04:02] that were under that restoration message
[1:04:04] they were under that restoration
[1:04:05] dispensation and they're they're they're
[1:04:07] seeing everything
[1:04:08] all the loose ends tied up as it were
[1:04:10] they're seeing everything restored back
[1:04:12] they're seeing the capstone being fitted
[1:04:14] to that temple
[1:04:15] and they're seeing all these wonderful
[1:04:16] things and yet in the hearts of many of
[1:04:18] the people there was a discouragement
[1:04:19] until god actually had to address it
[1:04:21] he had to address it through a prophet's
[1:04:23] message amen and he calls out this
[1:04:25] discouragement in the heart of the
[1:04:26] people and the discouragement was that
[1:04:28] they remembered solomon's temple
[1:04:30] they remembered how glorious it was they
[1:04:32] remember what god had done back then how
[1:04:33] did he how that fire fell from heaven
[1:04:35] and filled solomon's temple they
[1:04:37] remembered the gold and the finery
[1:04:38] and this and the cedar and the silk and
[1:04:41] and all the things that deck that temple
[1:04:43] and so when and here they're living in a
[1:04:44] great time a time of return from
[1:04:46] captivity
[1:04:47] it's a time of restoration amen but but
[1:04:50] the people were discouraged because what
[1:04:52] they were seeing with their eyes
[1:04:54] amen it didn't measure up to what they
[1:04:57] could look to in the past
[1:04:58] it seemed so simple seemed too humble
[1:05:02] and it actually caused the
[1:05:03] discouragement of the heart of people so
[1:05:05] what does god do he sends them a prophet
[1:05:06] in their midst
[1:05:07] amen and he says don't be discouraged
[1:05:08] people i know this house is in
[1:05:10] comparison of
[1:05:11] of solomon's temple as nothing but he
[1:05:13] said i'm making a promise
[1:05:14] i'm making a promise that there's coming
[1:05:16] a latter glory to this temple
[1:05:18] which shall be a greater than the former
[1:05:21] amen a great
[1:05:22] latter glory this prophecy of a latter
[1:05:24] glory see
[1:05:25] see god had something in mind and so it
[1:05:27] didn't matter
[1:05:28] the humility of what the people could do
[1:05:31] amen what was important was what god had
[1:05:33] in his heart
[1:05:34] because we know the fulfillment of that
[1:05:35] we know what that latter glory was
[1:05:37] it was the personal presence of the lord
[1:05:39] jesus christ in a flesh body when he
[1:05:41] came through the front door of that
[1:05:42] temple amen
[1:05:43] and the personal presence of jesus
[1:05:45] christ is a greater glory than all of
[1:05:47] solomon's amen
[1:05:48] amen and and that's why a greater than
[1:05:50] solomon is still here today
[1:05:51] in spite of the humility that we see in
[1:05:53] spite of dwindling numbers and church
[1:05:55] issues
[1:05:56] and darknesses of this time we're not
[1:05:58] looking at those things we're looking at
[1:06:00] a promise of glory
[1:06:01] coming to this bride christ the mystery
[1:06:03] of god revealed in you
[1:06:04] your hope of glory glory be to god amen
[1:06:07] and you know i i've been studying on
[1:06:09] that temple how to down through the ages
[1:06:11] all the things that transpired in
[1:06:12] history
[1:06:13] between the making of that promise and
[1:06:14] the coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:06:16] it wasn't long after that time that
[1:06:18] alexander the great conquered all of the
[1:06:20] eastern lands
[1:06:21] all of the persian empire and he brought
[1:06:22] it under his dominion and under that
[1:06:24] when he died his his empire uh fractured
[1:06:27] and a man named antiochus one of his
[1:06:29] generals took over all the persian lands
[1:06:31] including the land of
[1:06:32] judea and that's where you read the
[1:06:34] story of the maccabees and things like
[1:06:35] that and
[1:06:36] antiochus was a pagan man he erected a
[1:06:38] statue to zeus on the temple mount
[1:06:40] he actually sacrificed a pig on the
[1:06:42] altar of incense
[1:06:44] can you imagine amen then the romans
[1:06:46] come along and they kick out the greeks
[1:06:48] and the roman general poppy he sacks the
[1:06:51] city of jerusalem
[1:06:52] he walks into that temple he opens the
[1:06:54] curtain and a pagan
[1:06:56] unbeliever a pagan roman a gentile steps
[1:06:58] into the holy of holies
[1:07:00] and defiles it with his presence amen
[1:07:03] herod tries to patch it up amen but but
[1:07:06] the
[1:07:06] uh but the old forms of worship are gone
[1:07:09] the old
[1:07:10] the old prophets and the old and the old
[1:07:12] sacrifices those days were over and
[1:07:14] and he tries to add a new cord called
[1:07:15] the court of the gentiles
[1:07:17] amen so that the so the gentile people
[1:07:19] could come in and they could mingle with
[1:07:21] god's chosen people and it just
[1:07:22] desecrated
[1:07:23] amen the atmosphere of that temple amen
[1:07:26] and all those things are a type of
[1:07:27] our of the our religious day amen their
[1:07:30] type of how christianity in our day has
[1:07:32] been perverted even in message churches
[1:07:33] denominational spirits have had their
[1:07:35] way in many places
[1:07:36] and many ministries and many lives say
[1:07:38] man amen but you know
[1:07:40] i began to think about that and i began
[1:07:42] to marvel to think of all the sacrilege
[1:07:44] and all the
[1:07:45] and all the profanity and all the
[1:07:47] terrible things that were committed in
[1:07:48] that holy temple amen
[1:07:50] but he came anyway church he came anyway
[1:07:53] because why because god had a desire in
[1:07:55] his heart
[1:07:56] amen to bring his personal presence to
[1:07:58] humanity
[1:07:59] amen so that he could fellowship with us
[1:08:01] oh he knew the roughness of the hue as
[1:08:03] beautiful as solomon's temple was
[1:08:04] amen if you were to go back and see that
[1:08:07] place you would see humanity all over
[1:08:08] that building
[1:08:09] every stone that was chipped every every
[1:08:12] every sheet of gold that was hammered
[1:08:14] was full of mistakes full of
[1:08:16] imperfections full of humanity but he
[1:08:18] filled it anyway
[1:08:19] church amen because god is so desiring
[1:08:22] fellowship with his people that he would
[1:08:24] come
[1:08:24] he would come down beyond that amen
[1:08:26] that's the day that we're living in
[1:08:27] france he sees how rough the hue of
[1:08:29] these temples
[1:08:30] amen he sees the humanity of our lives
[1:08:32] he sees the problems in the world
[1:08:34] the problems in the churches and the
[1:08:36] problems around the message
[1:08:37] but it has not it has not staggered his
[1:08:40] program
[1:08:41] amen it has not it has not prevented his
[1:08:43] desire from coming to pass
[1:08:45] he is present with the bride of jesus
[1:08:47] christ
[1:08:48] amen he's real amongst us he's
[1:08:51] indwelling us
[1:08:52] he's with us and he's the prince of
[1:08:55] peace amen
[1:08:56] so we can have peace in spite of the
[1:08:58] humanity peace in spite of your problems
[1:09:01] peace in spite of your backgrounds if
[1:09:02] god amen if god would
[1:09:04] overlook the blood of a pig on the altar
[1:09:06] of incense a stench in his nostrils and
[1:09:08] he would come anyway
[1:09:10] to reveal himself to human race amen how
[1:09:12] much more amen will he come to a
[1:09:14] backslidden brother
[1:09:16] or a backslidden sister you're not
[1:09:18] bothering god by asking him to come back
[1:09:20] in
[1:09:20] you're only surrendering to his desire
[1:09:24] amen because his desire is to bring all
[1:09:26] everything he promised to pass
[1:09:28] and he didn't leave it up to you or i he
[1:09:31] came anyway with a new program i'm a
[1:09:32] little off my notes but it's wonderful
[1:09:34] to think about he came to that temple
[1:09:36] that had been defiled and how had been
[1:09:38] profane
[1:09:39] and every temple that any man ever tried
[1:09:41] to build god
[1:09:42] was desecrated and it inevitably fell
[1:09:44] moses built a tabernacle and it
[1:09:46] dissolved
[1:09:47] amen david had a desire to build god a
[1:09:49] temple but he had blood on his hands
[1:09:52] solomon built a temple and he was taken
[1:09:53] into babylonian captivity
[1:09:55] zerubbabel built a temple and it fell to
[1:09:56] the greeks herod tried to renovate a
[1:09:58] temple
[1:09:59] amen and it didn't work amen but jesus
[1:10:02] comes
[1:10:03] and he says you can tear this down
[1:10:06] because i'm going to build one
[1:10:08] i'll build one in three days of
[1:10:10] justification sanctification
[1:10:12] and the baptism of the holy ghost i'll
[1:10:14] build a temple and then what'll he do
[1:10:16] i'll come to the temple that i built
[1:10:19] and this one won't dissolve this one
[1:10:21] won't crumble this one won't fail
[1:10:24] i'll i poured the foundation on the day
[1:10:26] of pentecost
[1:10:27] i brought down the capstone crying grace
[1:10:30] and then i came to the temple that i
[1:10:32] built and i inhabited with my own
[1:10:33] presence
[1:10:34] all that well god was he poured into the
[1:10:36] bride you or i didn't build this message
[1:10:39] we didn't build these churches we didn't
[1:10:42] build this movement we didn't start this
[1:10:43] revival it's a bride's revival
[1:10:46] we're not kingdom builders we're but
[1:10:48] we're in the kingdom
[1:10:50] hallelujah god so desire to have
[1:10:52] fellowship with man he comes to a flawed
[1:10:54] temple and he comes in peace
[1:10:56] not to destroy but to build to build
[1:10:58] something lasting to build something
[1:11:00] eternal
[1:11:01] to build something beautiful oh unto us
[1:11:04] a child is born
[1:11:06] unto us the sun is given you see god's
[1:11:08] word
[1:11:09] god's desire and god's plan cannot be
[1:11:11] defeated by human imperfections
[1:11:14] and that should bring us peace this
[1:11:15] morning to think brother branham
[1:11:17] preached does god change his mind and he
[1:11:19] spoke of a permissive will and he
[1:11:20] preaches about balaam and
[1:11:21] we're familiar with these things he says
[1:11:23] god has a permissive will and that's
[1:11:25] where the trouble lies we try to work on
[1:11:26] god's permissive will and he will permit
[1:11:28] it
[1:11:29] but also if we take his permissive will
[1:11:31] although it's not right
[1:11:32] he will make his permissive will
[1:11:37] work out to glorify his perfect will
[1:11:40] amen why because he's a sovereign god
[1:11:43] and he's ultimately in control he said
[1:11:45] there's nothing will go wrong with god
[1:11:48] every lick is hitting just exactly the
[1:11:51] way it should be
[1:11:51] and everything we think it's wrong but
[1:11:54] he knows that it's right
[1:11:56] glory be to god church amen we are not
[1:11:59] to look at the
[1:12:00] so much on the negative we are not to be
[1:12:02] discouraged looking at the problems
[1:12:04] facing the church
[1:12:05] looking at dark in the the darkness of
[1:12:07] laodicea amen we may think it's wrong
[1:12:10] we may think things aren't right we may
[1:12:12] we may think things need to be fixed but
[1:12:13] god is not
[1:12:14] out he's never lost control he's a
[1:12:17] sovereign god
[1:12:18] it'll come back to perfect to glorify
[1:12:20] his perfect will and we're not powerful
[1:12:22] enough in our humanity
[1:12:23] and the world is not strong enough in
[1:12:25] its darkness to frustrate the plan of
[1:12:28] god
[1:12:29] amen grace will perform this the zeal of
[1:12:32] god will perform this
[1:12:33] god's building up zion you see oh but
[1:12:36] they weren't satisfied with that son
[1:12:37] that was given because it was too humble
[1:12:40] it was too humble so they missed god's
[1:12:41] peace they thought this prince would
[1:12:43] come and he would be a great shining
[1:12:45] general that they that's the prince of
[1:12:46] peace that they had in mind a great
[1:12:48] shining general would
[1:12:49] open up the curtains of the table and
[1:12:50] step out fully grown and covered with
[1:12:52] shining armor
[1:12:53] amen he'd say caiaphas i've arrived
[1:12:55] let's overthrow the roman rule let's
[1:12:57] bring the whole world under our
[1:12:58] subjection let's
[1:12:59] let's take the jewish faith you know to
[1:13:02] its zenith and
[1:13:03] amen and and and by and and
[1:13:06] overshadow even solomon's empire that's
[1:13:09] what they expected
[1:13:10] and they couldn't receive christ in a
[1:13:12] manger they couldn't receive christ
[1:13:15] amen amongst animals amongst filth amen
[1:13:18] uh brother ram said said jesus christ
[1:13:21] god on a pile of manure god pitching his
[1:13:24] tent with us
[1:13:25] god in humanity they could not receive
[1:13:27] that church and when god comes when this
[1:13:30] prince of peace comes
[1:13:31] he always comes that way he never comes
[1:13:33] according to our grand expectations
[1:13:35] but he hides himself in simplicity the
[1:13:38] most powerful messages he ever preached
[1:13:40] he bookmarked them with god hiding
[1:13:41] himself in simplicity what do you think
[1:13:43] that simplicity is brother sister
[1:13:45] it's your life and my life our
[1:13:47] simplicity
[1:13:48] our humility our humanity just like he
[1:13:50] came in the lord jesus christ
[1:13:52] amen that's why they weren't satisfied
[1:13:54] with the son that was given
[1:13:55] and neither are they satisfied with the
[1:13:57] advent of the bride
[1:13:58] amen because people are looking for some
[1:14:01] something superhuman
[1:14:02] some kind of a public show some great
[1:14:05] thing that will just shake the world
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:07] and so they cannot receive christ in you
[1:14:09] the hope of glory
[1:14:10] neither can you or i brother sister many
[1:14:12] times receive what a message is trying
[1:14:14] to reveal to us
[1:14:15] because we cannot look beyond this flesh
[1:14:17] but we have to look beyond the veil
[1:14:19] amen we must see beyond the veil and see
[1:14:21] the glory of god working in the bride
[1:14:23] but you won't see it if you're looking
[1:14:25] for your expectations
[1:14:26] amen it must be revealed by the message
[1:14:28] of the hour god chose
[1:14:30] to birth his child under the under the
[1:14:33] reputation of an illegitimate son that
[1:14:35] was no accident
[1:14:36] that was no unfortunate happenstance
[1:14:38] that was god's choosing it was his
[1:14:40] predestination

[1:16:42] looking at the darkness feeling the
[1:16:45] rocking of the waves
[1:16:48] and they weren't thinking about who was
[1:16:49] in the boat
[1:16:51] hallelujah brother bran preaches a
[1:16:53] message shalom

[1:16:57] out there in sierra vista

[1:17:00] message shalom and he begins to talk
[1:17:02] about the darkness of the world he
[1:17:03] begins to talk about the sin
[1:17:04] that's in humanity he begins to talk
[1:17:06] about the gross dark and he talks about
[1:17:07] the wickedness of the world and all
[1:17:09] these things and he stops when he's
[1:17:10] preaching he says listen now
[1:17:12] he said now listen i i'm talking about
[1:17:14] we're talking about the darkness
[1:17:16] so that we can get to the shalom amen he
[1:17:19] didn't come
[1:17:20] amen he didn't come to bring
[1:17:21] discouragement his message to the to the
[1:17:24] elect
[1:17:24] to the church of the living god amen was
[1:17:27] not to bring our focus
[1:17:28] on the wickedness of this world on the
[1:17:30] judgment that's falling but he was
[1:17:32] bringing us a shalom
[1:17:33] amen sometimes friends we spend way too
[1:17:35] much time focusing on the signs of the
[1:17:37] times
[1:17:38] looking at the darkness of this world
[1:17:39] and looking all those things amen
[1:17:41] problems in the churches and things but
[1:17:43] but but that's not our message and
[1:17:46] that's always the way that the word of
[1:17:48] god comes it has a dual
[1:17:49] it has a dual effect when the word is
[1:17:51] revealed into a generation
[1:17:53] it's a rebuke to the world it's judgment
[1:17:55] to the world and this message was an
[1:17:57] indictment to this world
[1:17:59] but to the bride it's shalom he did not
[1:18:01] come to judge you he did not come
[1:18:03] to pass to pass judgment onto you or
[1:18:06] hold you over hell fire
[1:18:08] amen you won't bring this bride under
[1:18:10] lay out of scene rebuke she's not blind
[1:18:11] she's seen the light
[1:18:13] glory be to god she has the prince of
[1:18:15] peace
[1:18:17] we should have peace we should have a
[1:18:18] shalom amen brother branham's talking
[1:18:21] about all this darkness in the world not
[1:18:22] to bring a discouragement
[1:18:24] but to bring a contrast that we have a
[1:18:27] shalom
[1:18:28] don't you believe that amen
[1:18:31] oh to get to the shalom we oh you know
[1:18:35] and so we we we need a revelation
[1:18:40] need the unveiling of the holy spirit we
[1:18:42] need god's help
[1:18:43] to look beyond this veil he's the only
[1:18:45] one that can open it
[1:18:46] amen he's the only one that can that can
[1:18:48] bring and usher us into that holy place
[1:18:51] where we're cognizant and recognize the
[1:18:53] presence of god in that shekinah he's
[1:18:55] the only one that can do it friends
[1:18:56] and he can do it he has the power to do
[1:18:58] it he will do it
[1:18:59] he desires to do it he promised to do it
[1:19:02] amen and he's doing it amongst our midst
[1:19:04] you know
[1:19:05] so it does not behoove the bride of
[1:19:07] jesus christ to look at our humanity
[1:19:09] to look at our failures to look at the
[1:19:11] the problems in our lives and in our
[1:19:13] churches
[1:19:13] amen brother branham preached alone and
[1:19:15] he begins to talk about how god
[1:19:17] can take creation and he can multiply it
[1:19:19] amen how he did it many times he took
[1:19:21] water
[1:19:22] and he multiplied it to be wine amen he
[1:19:24] took little loaves and little fishes
[1:19:26] and and he was able to take that that
[1:19:29] simple thing
[1:19:30] and multiply it and that's the kind of
[1:19:32] god our creator is he's able to take
[1:19:34] take simplicity take humanity take
[1:19:36] humility and he can multiply it but in
[1:19:38] the last days brother branham said
[1:19:40] he did something a little bit different
[1:19:42] amen he said in the last days where
[1:19:44] there is no sign of creation
[1:19:47] he can speak it into creation anyhow
[1:19:50] don't miss this now whatever oh it shows
[1:19:53] that he's the same god that was in the
[1:19:54] beginning he can create squirrels
[1:19:57] not not taking something and multiplying
[1:19:59] it he took nothing
[1:20:00] and he brought life he brought creation
[1:20:02] friends he spoke
[1:20:04] squirrels and so if he can do that
[1:20:06] brother brahm said he can create
[1:20:08] whatever he wants to
[1:20:09] because he's god amen i tell you friends
[1:20:12] if he can take nothing
[1:20:14] and make it something surely he can take
[1:20:16] you or i
[1:20:17] though we be nothing though he be dust
[1:20:19] to this world
[1:20:20] and he can take it and create a life he
[1:20:23] can create a son of god
[1:20:24] he can create an invincible army he can
[1:20:27] create the bride of jesus christ out of
[1:20:28] nothing
[1:20:30] and not only create it but then he can
[1:20:31] take that creation and he can multiply
[1:20:33] it
[1:20:33] he can bring things out of your life you
[1:20:35] never imagined were possible
[1:20:36] amen he can bring power he can bring the
[1:20:38] supernatural he can bring healings and
[1:20:40] miracles and overcoming
[1:20:41] amen and deliverance he brings all that
[1:20:43] out of nothing
[1:20:46] amen so why are we discouraged wondering
[1:20:49] how we'll get it all together
[1:20:50] how will how we'll claw our way up to
[1:20:52] our adoption
[1:20:54] how we'll ever come to a maturity you
[1:20:56] don't have to do anything
[1:20:58] but lay in this light lay under this
[1:21:01] shalom
[1:21:01] it will ripen you it will it will dry
[1:21:04] all the humanity out it will multiply
[1:21:06] the seed that went into the ground will
[1:21:07] bring forth a hundredfold
[1:21:10] because he wants it and he's the creator
[1:21:13] he's the creator
[1:21:15] he speaks it into creation anyhow oh
[1:21:17] brother brandon preach that wonderful
[1:21:19] message go wake jesus
[1:21:21] and he begins to tell the people he said
[1:21:24] what are you anyway
[1:21:26] he said you're texas clay you're
[1:21:28] louisiana clay
[1:21:30] you're nothing amen 16 elements of mud
[1:21:34] and dust and clay
[1:21:36] amen is all that we are amen
[1:21:39] oh but but in that message he makes a
[1:21:41] wonderful statement he said the very
[1:21:43] creator
[1:21:45] that created that dirt created that
[1:21:47] earth created that clay
[1:21:49] he said he's riding in that mudship
[1:21:55] i like that he's riding in that mudship
[1:21:59] you know that's what you and i are we're
[1:22:01] nothing
[1:22:02] every gift every talent that we have he
[1:22:04] can't even use it
[1:22:06] amen we have nothing to offer god we
[1:22:08] have no value we have no intrinsic worth
[1:22:11] we are nothing but the dust of this
[1:22:12] world there's nothing that separates you
[1:22:13] and i from anyone out here
[1:22:15] under any church or out in this world or
[1:22:17] any bar stool nothing but dust
[1:22:20] and clay and dirt but a creator a master
[1:22:25] a potter can take that and he can shape
[1:22:28] it friends
[1:22:29] and he knows how to shape it he knows
[1:22:31] how to make that mudship he knows the
[1:22:33] right
[1:22:33] form he knows the right shape he knows
[1:22:35] how to bring it
[1:22:36] amen into the right form and he can make
[1:22:39] that ship so it won't sink
[1:22:41] you can't do it the power's not in the
[1:22:43] clay somebody had to take that clay
[1:22:46] bring it through pressure bring it
[1:22:48] through heat and bring it into the right
[1:22:49] form
[1:22:50] that's what he's doing hey man in that
[1:22:53] mud ship i think about i thought about
[1:22:54] that storm on the sea of galilee in that
[1:22:56] little ship
[1:22:57] amen and the disciples are riding there
[1:22:59] in that ship and just like many of us
[1:23:01] they didn't understand the situation
[1:23:02] that we were in how many times have we
[1:23:03] been through a trial
[1:23:04] or been through a situation we're just
[1:23:06] wondering lord what's going on why
[1:23:08] well why have you why have you brought
[1:23:10] this upon why
[1:23:11] why must these things be let this cup
[1:23:13] pass and how
[1:23:14] how many times have we been in turmoil
[1:23:17] and tossed on the waves of the cycle of
[1:23:19] a christian life
[1:23:20] amen and and we don't understand the
[1:23:22] situation
[1:23:23] amen because according to the disciples
[1:23:25] they knew it was the messiah but they
[1:23:26] thought he would bring peace
[1:23:28] they thought he was going to bring peace
[1:23:30] not only to that but the whole world
[1:23:32] they were looking for peace and here
[1:23:33] they're in the middle of this storm and
[1:23:34] they're and they're they're fearing that
[1:23:36] they've come to their end and it's not
[1:23:37] they're just not going to make that next
[1:23:39] wave they're not going to survive that
[1:23:41] next rock
[1:23:42] amen they just uh uh and so here he's
[1:23:45] supposed to bring peace but the world
[1:23:46] wasn't at peace but jesus corrected him
[1:23:48] amen he said think not that i'm come to
[1:23:49] send peace on earth i came not to send
[1:23:51] peace but a sword
[1:23:53] amen it was a word of separation a word
[1:23:55] of division waters
[1:23:56] of separation amen it was not according
[1:23:58] to their expectation but they were
[1:24:00] discouraged because they thought it
[1:24:01] would be all
[1:24:02] peace they thought everything would be
[1:24:04] wonderful around the message
[1:24:07] they thought he preached he preached the
[1:24:08] opening of the seventh seal and it just
[1:24:10] fixed all the problems that we had with
[1:24:11] humanity and
[1:24:13] amen and uh christ the mystery of god
[1:24:15] all that he was in christ he poured into
[1:24:16] the church and now we never
[1:24:17] disagree and we never fuss and we never
[1:24:20] have problems and we never get under
[1:24:22] afflictions and things their expectation
[1:24:25] was all wrong
[1:24:27] it was all wrong even the ones who heard
[1:24:29] his message we
[1:24:30] you could read right in that script they
[1:24:31] only heard parables right in that
[1:24:32] chapter
[1:24:33] he's preaching things and they're just
[1:24:34] hearing stories they're hearing
[1:24:35] apparently it didn't make sense they
[1:24:37] didn't understand
[1:24:38] because they had their idea of peace his
[1:24:42] was different amen so they're crying out
[1:24:45] just like we cry out master don't you
[1:24:46] care
[1:24:48] amen christians get to a place believers
[1:24:51] sons and daughters of god get to places
[1:24:53] dark times where we're where we wander
[1:24:56] where we cry out in times of weakness
[1:24:58] and unbelief god
[1:24:59] do you even care am i even called am i
[1:25:01] even your child
[1:25:02] did i ever have the holy ghost in the
[1:25:04] first place these things
[1:25:07] but it was it was just the wrong
[1:25:08] understanding
[1:25:10] amen because they were looking at the
[1:25:12] wrong thing
[1:25:13] they were looking at the circumstances
[1:25:16] looking at the conditions
[1:25:17] around them they didn't realize there
[1:25:19] was somebody in that little mud ship
[1:25:22] amen and all they had to do was go wake
[1:25:24] him they said master don't you care that
[1:25:26] we perish
[1:25:27] he said why are you afraid peace
[1:25:30] he said peace be still brother braham
[1:25:32] said you can wake jesus
[1:25:35] and you don't have to go say oh master
[1:25:37] master master and scream and cry out and
[1:25:39] and try to whip him up and try to muster
[1:25:42] something up or work something up he
[1:25:44] said no you just go say
[1:25:45] you just say master just call on him you
[1:25:48] can wake him
[1:25:49] amen and then he can speak peace to your
[1:25:51] storm
[1:25:52] amen but you've got to wake him up
[1:25:55] you've got to stop
[1:25:56] looking you got to stop looking at the
[1:25:59] conditions long enough
[1:26:00] amen to look to jesus call on jesus
[1:26:04] there was not peace in the world
[1:26:06] but there was peace on that boat i just
[1:26:08] thought about how
[1:26:09] my you know they thought he would bring
[1:26:11] peace to jerusalem
[1:26:12] he would overthrow the roman empire but
[1:26:14] there was no peace in jerusalem
[1:26:16] there was no peace in rome and there was
[1:26:18] no peace on the sea of galilee but there
[1:26:19] was peace in the boat
[1:26:21] oh hallelujah what a picture of a
[1:26:23] christian life there's no peace in
[1:26:24] laodicea there's no peace in america
[1:26:27] there's no peace in the churches there's
[1:26:29] not much peace around
[1:26:30] what's called the message of the hour
[1:26:32] amen but there's peace
[1:26:33] in this boat amen and there could be
[1:26:36] peace in your boat
[1:26:38] hallelujah don't worry when the
[1:26:40] circumstances don't match your
[1:26:41] expectations brother branham said
[1:26:43] they and go awake jesus he said they're
[1:26:45] trying to control the boat they're
[1:26:46] trying to they're trying in their own
[1:26:48] power they're trying to pull on the
[1:26:49] ropes and and and hang on the sail
[1:26:52] they're just they're trying to right the
[1:26:53] ship how many times in our life you know
[1:26:55] do we do we we really try to take
[1:26:57] control and get it all back together we
[1:27:00] we try to make something to happen we
[1:27:01] try to get brethren together and we try
[1:27:03] to
[1:27:03] you know we just try to organize
[1:27:04] something and achieve something amen and
[1:27:07] it all and
[1:27:08] everything ends up breaking brother
[1:27:09] branstad everything broke water filled
[1:27:11] the boat everything was falling apart
[1:27:12] and they were just about to sink and he
[1:27:15] said it looked like all hope was gone
[1:27:17] and there they are all troubled and
[1:27:18] scared
[1:27:19] he said it was a trouble that they could
[1:27:21] not remedy anymore
[1:27:24] and fear set in when they found out they
[1:27:27] could not remedy it
[1:27:28] amen and that's where we get afraid
[1:27:30] friends when we look at
[1:27:31] issues we look at problems and we look
[1:27:33] at our things in our life and we're and
[1:27:35] we say god

[1:27:38] trying my best working my hardest i
[1:27:40] cannot fix it we cannot remy it
[1:27:43] we do not have the cure amen and it
[1:27:46] brings a fear
[1:27:47] brother brandon begins to go down and go
[1:27:49] wake jesus and he begins to name all of
[1:27:50] these troubles
[1:27:51] and all of these things that we cannot
[1:27:52] remedy he speaks about natura

[1:29:41] epistles read of all men he said i turn
[1:29:43] it this way
[1:29:44] he said in other words you're an epistle
[1:29:46] that has already been written

[1:29:49] daughter of god you may go through
[1:29:50] trials you may go through hard times
[1:29:52] but if you were a thought of god in the
[1:29:54] beginning amen that if now that you have
[1:29:56] been manifested on this earth that which
[1:29:58] was a thought has been spoken into you
[1:30:00] making you part of the spoken word seed

[1:30:18] talking about a word
[1:30:20] that is in you which will not return
[1:30:22] void
[1:30:23] a prophet said how can he fail he can't
[1:30:25] lose you he can't lose one of his

[1:30:50] said what is the manifestation of this
[1:30:51] hour it's the word bride
[1:30:54] he said this time and this place is a
[1:30:56] promise that's given to her
[1:30:58] if you think that this message amen uh
[1:31:00] entered into a hibernation
[1:31:02] period in 1965 if you don't think god's
[1:31:04] doing something today
[1:31:05] you don't think he's raising up a bride
[1:31:07] you don't think he's calling last seed
[1:31:09] and filling young people with the holy
[1:31:10] ghost amen i'm i'm here to
[1:31:13] to to illuminate you friends amen
[1:31:15] because
[1:31:16] god is still writing epistles he's still
[1:31:18] speaking thoughts
[1:31:20] amen he's still bringing a message to
[1:31:22] life
[1:31:23] and this time and this place is a
[1:31:26] promised time
[1:31:26] a promised place and we are walking in
[1:31:29] the perfect will of god
[1:31:32] in the middle of a storm in the middle
[1:31:34] of dark laodicea
[1:31:36] god has a bride whoo
[1:31:39] hallelujah amen i know i get a little
[1:31:42] excited
[1:31:43] how about you let me be on myself and
[1:31:44] i'll let you be yourself and we'll have
[1:31:46] a good time around the word of god
[1:31:48] amen oh you won't return void
[1:31:51] amen and you're a pistol that's already
[1:31:53] been written in other words brother
[1:31:54] branham said it can't be added to i know
[1:31:58] that the devil has a whole bunch of
[1:31:59] footnotes
[1:32:00] and a whole lot of thing a whole
[1:32:02] appendix written which he would like to
[1:32:04] attach to the book of your life
[1:32:05] how that you failed here and how you
[1:32:07] went through this trial here and you
[1:32:08] came out of a certain
[1:32:10] family situation or a certain church
[1:32:12] situation or you're dealing with a
[1:32:13] certain struggle
[1:32:14] and the devil would like to attach it to
[1:32:16] that to you but he cannot do it
[1:32:18] because it's not written it can't it's
[1:32:20] it's been written friends
[1:32:22] that's our defense against the devil
[1:32:23] when he came to jesus amen oh he didn't
[1:32:26] argue with the devil
[1:32:27] he didn't he didn't he didn't put his
[1:32:30] own spin on the facts and bring a new
[1:32:31] narrative
[1:32:32] he said it is written and that's the
[1:32:35] answer to the devil's question
[1:32:37] you're too late devil to try to pin
[1:32:39] those things on me too late to try to
[1:32:41] bring a discouragement too late to point
[1:32:43] out the turmoil
[1:32:44] and the church struggles and the
[1:32:45] national troubles in the darkness of
[1:32:46] laodicea
[1:32:48] it's already written it's already spoken
[1:32:51] i already heard god's message oh
[1:32:54] hallelujah
[1:32:56] hallelujah you think about noah tossed
[1:32:59] on the sea
[1:33:00] just like those disciples how noah he's
[1:33:02] there on that boat and
[1:33:03] and and no doubt without a doubt noah
[1:33:06] he's sitting there tossed on the sea and
[1:33:08] the only window that he had was of two
[1:33:10] above
[1:33:11] the only visibility the only light that
[1:33:12] he had was to look up because everything
[1:33:14] around was darkness and
[1:33:16] and dung amen and so he's looking up and
[1:33:18] he's tossed on that sea
[1:33:20] and without a doubt noah's mind must
[1:33:22] have been full of turmoil
[1:33:23] he must have mind battle after mind
[1:33:25] battle he must have been under fear he
[1:33:26] must have been under pressure he must
[1:33:28] have been a worry
[1:33:29] what if uh what if i what if we just
[1:33:31] float here for months and months and we
[1:33:32] never come to land and we just sink
[1:33:35] and we die and we perish and no doubt
[1:33:37] noah felt that way
[1:33:39] but it's not written all that's written
[1:33:43] is by faith noah that's all it's written
[1:33:46] friends
[1:33:47] and all that's been written over this
[1:33:49] bride is victory the only thing written
[1:33:51] in this message is overcoming the only
[1:33:53] thing written for you and i is a rapture
[1:33:55] amen yes judgment is written for this
[1:33:57] world it's written over these churches
[1:33:59] it's written over
[1:34:00] denominations but it's not written of
[1:34:02] you
[1:34:03] you've had a shalom the prince of peace
[1:34:06] has passed judgment over you
[1:34:08] with an with a rulership with an
[1:34:10] authority a headship
[1:34:11] glory be to god amen all that's written
[1:34:14] is by faith
[1:34:16] and all that will be written of you is
[1:34:18] how your faith overcame layout asia
[1:34:21] your faith persisted through national
[1:34:24] turmoil your faith persisted through
[1:34:26] church troubles your faith
[1:34:27] uh persisted through personal adversity
[1:34:30] and trials and tribulations
[1:34:32] your faith persisted it was never your
[1:34:34] faith to begin with it's the faith of
[1:34:35] god within you
[1:34:38] if you're focused on the problems you'll
[1:34:41] miss the message
[1:34:43] you'll miss his presence the creator
[1:34:47] is in this mudship jesus is in your boat
[1:34:52] christ the mystery of god is revealed in
[1:34:54] you
[1:34:56] we have this treasure in earth and
[1:34:58] vessels that the excellency of the power
[1:34:59] may be of god
[1:35:01] and not of us it brings me peace
[1:35:05] it seems like at the end time brother
[1:35:06] branham said at this time that the
[1:35:08] message and messenger both
[1:35:09] are about broke what a what a statement
[1:35:11] from a prophet of god
[1:35:13] end time evangelism he said it seems
[1:35:14] like at the end time at the end time
[1:35:16] here's what it seems like
[1:35:18] at the end time it seems like the
[1:35:20] message and the messenger are just about
[1:35:22] broke
[1:35:23] it looks like satan has tried his best
[1:35:25] to rim wreck us
[1:35:27] looks like we're defeated
[1:35:30] [Laughter]
[1:35:32] but don't you worry he said you know
[1:35:35] it's usually at that time when god steps
[1:35:37] in on the scene of something he's been
[1:35:38] watching for a long time
[1:35:41] and it's in those weakest moments when
[1:35:43] it looks like the true message is just
[1:35:45] about defeated
[1:35:46] that's when god steps in and he lets the
[1:35:49] message
[1:35:49] and the messenger get to the end of the
[1:35:51] road and he comes in and he rides the
[1:35:53] high waves
[1:35:54] glory be to god friends the creator is
[1:35:57] in these boats the creator is in this
[1:35:59] message he's in your ship
[1:36:01] amen and it might look like you're about
[1:36:02] to wreck but you're not
[1:36:04] it might like like there's problems in
[1:36:06] the message but there's not
[1:36:07] he knows what he's doing he's at just
[1:36:09] let him take the helm
[1:36:11] and he will christ every wave amen i've
[1:36:14] lived long enough with god even as a
[1:36:15] young man to know that if it was up to
[1:36:17] me to hold myself i'd already be gone
[1:36:19] but there's an anchor friends he's
[1:36:21] spoken of an acre oh i know people are
[1:36:23] tossed about but he said there's an
[1:36:24] anchor
[1:36:25] and the old ship will hold the waves
[1:36:26] will never seek her because there's
[1:36:28] something that hold it
[1:36:29] sometimes we get in our darkest trials
[1:36:31] and we get thrown against the chain of
[1:36:32] that anchor
[1:36:33] just to find out that it won't break
[1:36:36] that something's holding you
[1:36:38] and you can't even hold yourself glory
[1:36:40] be to god he rides the high waves
[1:36:42] as christians we often look for peace
[1:36:44] and all we find is a storm
[1:36:46] not realizing that peace is with us
[1:36:50] even in us and never out here
[1:36:54] not until a time to come not until a son
[1:36:57] of david rain
[1:36:58] he said i go to prepare a place for you
[1:37:00] but i'll not leave you comfortless

[1:37:05] hope without security

[1:37:56] even if it might feel like it brother
[1:37:58] bran spoke with three hebrew children
[1:38:00] that felt like they were alone
[1:38:02] they didn't know they even said look god
[1:38:04] can bring us out of this but he might
[1:38:06] not
[1:38:07] his will will be done they they felt
[1:38:10] that they're looking at the
[1:38:11] circumstances and they had no nothing
[1:38:14] that felt secured
[1:38:15] to to lean upon they were in a trial
[1:38:17] fiery trial
[1:38:18] a test but you find that the fire could
[1:38:22] only loose them from their bonds
[1:38:24] the only thing it could serve to do amen
[1:38:26] was loose them
[1:38:28] for for somebody who's in the hands of
[1:38:29] this potter all the fire can do is shape
[1:38:31] you

[1:38:34] do is bring beauty to your form
[1:38:36] amen all it can do is bring and what was

[1:40:05] in that midst of that struggle that was
[1:40:07] able to take a fraud
[1:40:08] take a trickster or a shyster and what
[1:40:11] do we find in the morning brother
[1:40:12] branham said a fearless prince
[1:40:15] and the prince of peace amen is able to
[1:40:18] take you through the turmoils of your
[1:40:20] life when you're wrestling not well
[1:40:21] you're not just wrestling with adversity
[1:40:23] not just wrestling with layout of seeing
[1:40:25] darkness and things like that you're
[1:40:26] wrestling with your own humanity
[1:40:28] and your own failures and your own
[1:40:30] insignificance
[1:40:31] and weakness and frailty and the prince
[1:40:34] of peace comes and says look
[1:40:37] you're not known by that name you're not
[1:40:39] under that identification
[1:40:41] i spoke a message over you i spoke a new
[1:40:43] name over you i've
[1:40:44] married you to myself and now my grace
[1:40:47] is sufficient for thee

[1:40:58] the prince of peace amen here we're
[1:41:00] battling with all this lay out of seeing
[1:41:02] nonsense all this darkness all these
[1:41:04] politics all these church problems all
[1:41:06] this negativity that we could be looking
[1:41:08] at
[1:41:09] and dealing with and and even in our own
[1:41:11] churches even amongst the message of the
[1:41:12] hour we see those denominational spirits
[1:41:14] trying to get in
[1:41:15] we see spiritual death coming amongst
[1:41:17] the people coldness
[1:41:18] formality all of these things coming in
[1:41:22] amen but you know brother branham gives
[1:41:24] a third example
[1:41:25] he says when you're he said when jesus
[1:41:28] came
[1:41:28] and and to the shock of death jesus came
[1:41:31] even to death
[1:41:32] but he said when he recovered from the
[1:41:34] shock of death
[1:41:36] that's when he was at his strongest
[1:41:40] friends you can you can kill this bride
[1:41:44] you can try to bring darkness on her you
[1:41:47] could try to bring
[1:41:48] a spiritual death upon her you can bring
[1:41:51] her under every
[1:41:52] under every denominational spirit a
[1:41:54] spiritual death lay out a sea and
[1:41:56] affliction you can try to bring anything
[1:41:57] on her you can lock her in a prison you
[1:41:59] can take away your life
[1:42:01] amen but one thing you can never do amen
[1:42:04] is take that resurrection power that's
[1:42:05] on the inside
[1:42:06] so let her come even down to death let a
[1:42:08] young person that's called of god
[1:42:10] get in such a backslidden condition
[1:42:11] until they're running away from god as
[1:42:13] fast as they can if that's elected seed
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:16] they'll come down to the to the to an
[1:42:18] ultimate spiritual death but a
[1:42:20] resurrection power on the inside will
[1:42:21] raise them up
[1:42:22] amen and stronger than ever before you
[1:42:24] cannot defeat him he is the prince of
[1:42:26] peace
[1:42:27] he has authority he has power amen
[1:42:30] his will will be done he is he is an
[1:42:32] ultimate authority he is a sovereign god
[1:42:35] and he has spoken grace over you and i
[1:42:36] france amen shall we stand
[1:42:39] amen he says he said in the end time
[1:42:41] evangelism it looks like it's pretty
[1:42:43] weak now
[1:42:44] for both message and messenger but don't
[1:42:46] you worry
[1:42:48] somewhere i don't know how he said but
[1:42:50] i'm trusting him
[1:42:52] in that isn't that powerful i don't know
[1:42:54] how
[1:42:56] but i'm trusting him he'll come riding
[1:42:58] in someday don't you worry
[1:43:01] my brother my sister the prophet said
[1:43:04] it's always darkest
[1:43:06] just before the dawn so if you
[1:43:10] if you're feeling maybe the lord has put
[1:43:12] it on my heart for you as an individual
[1:43:14] you feel that you're going through a
[1:43:15] dark trial maybe your darkest trial
[1:43:17] your hardest moment maybe you know
[1:43:21] maybe uh maybe it's challenges in this
[1:43:23] world and its politics and
[1:43:25] its economy and those things have
[1:43:27] impacted you maybe its trouble in the
[1:43:29] church we know the church is in a
[1:43:30] transition time and
[1:43:32] and struggles come from that and uh
[1:43:36] and it may look dark whatever you're
[1:43:38] going through may be dark
[1:43:40] amen but the message has brought us a
[1:43:42] light
[1:43:43] it's the rising of the sun it's a new
[1:43:45] dawn
[1:43:47] amen and the darkness only makes it
