[43:16] a woman is always a representative of
[43:20] the church
[43:22] and um there's many churches that are
[43:24] represented are represented in the word
[43:27] of god when god is speaking to different
[43:30] um different women in the bible and it's
[43:33] our job to rightly discern and rightly
[43:36] divide the word of god and so we've got
[43:39] to be able to divide the word of god and
[43:41] take our part the part that that
[43:44] represents us and we can apply that to
[43:46] our lives and then we can take the other
[43:49] representatives that maybe do not
[43:51] represent us like for instance these
[43:53] daughters of jerusalem would be speaking
[43:55] to the jewish the jews the jewish people
[43:58] but when we see
[44:00] this talking about the daughter of zion
[44:02] we're taught that the daughters of zion
[44:04] is always a representation of the bride
[44:07] of jesus christ and we know that that
[44:09] bride of jesus christ just like joseph
[44:11] had a bride was a gentile bride and so
[44:14] we've got to be able to rightly divide
[44:16] that so so men and and boys tonight i
[44:19] would tell you that that when we speak
[44:21] of daughters we're also speaking about
[44:24] boys as well so boys and girls are both
[44:26] included in this and
[44:28] and so i want you to feel
[44:30] uh safe that this is not just simply a
[44:33] message to the ladies of the church you
[44:35] this is not a free pass this does not
[44:37] give you license
[44:39] to get up and go play basketball
[44:48] um when we look at the scripture
[44:52] rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout
[44:54] out of jerusalem behold thy king
[44:57] cometh unto thee
[44:59] he is just and having salvation lowly
[45:02] and riding upon an ass and upon a cult
[45:04] the full of an ass this was a prophecy
[45:08] and this prophecy was fulfilled
[45:10] when jesus came riding into jerusalem
[45:15] upon an ass upon a cult and
[45:19] the people that were looking for jesus
[45:22] those that were looking for the messiah
[45:24] to come and that had recognized that
[45:27] jesus was the fulfillment of those
[45:30] scriptures
[45:31] they begin to rejoice
[45:33] and they begin to cry out and they begin
[45:35] to tear the palm branches off of the
[45:37] trees and they would lay them in the
[45:40] road
[45:40] in front of that little donkey and while
[45:43] jesus was riding into jerusalem on his
[45:46] way to the crucifixion
[45:48] and they began to shout and when they
[45:50] ran out of palms they took their coats
[45:52] off and they began throwing their coats
[45:54] in the road and they began to sing
[45:56] hosanna hosanna
[45:59] the the lord god in the highest and they
[46:01] begin saying these things
[46:04] about jesus and those that were not
[46:06] looking for jesus
[46:08] thought what is this
[46:10] this is strange
[46:12] we don't understand this why would they
[46:14] say this and those that perhaps knew
[46:17] this prophecy perhaps knew that there
[46:20] was to be a messiah but did not
[46:23] acknowledge jesus as that messiah they
[46:26] were even angered
[46:31] and they began to say
[46:33] keep it down and and they told jesus
[46:36] tell them to be quiet and he said if i
[46:39] if i tell them to hold their peace the
[46:42] rocks will immediately cry out
[46:48] now
[46:55] everybody here
[46:57] is either
[46:59] a daughter
[47:01] is the product of a daughter
[47:04] is married to a daughter
[47:06] or is hoping to marry a daughter
[47:09] or has a daughter
[47:11] or will one day have a daughter
[47:17] and so this message to daughters and i
[47:19] will
[47:21] i will say this i i had a brother
[47:25] there at arizona believers church in
[47:27] phoenix helped me with these slides and
[47:29] so when you see the little the little
[47:31] emblem
[47:33] there that arizona believers church down
[47:35] there in the right hand corner
[47:37] just know that that there was a brother
[47:39] that goes to arizona believer's church
[47:42] to help me put this together and so also
[47:44] i send greetings from arizona believers
[47:46] church
[47:47] and from brother aaron mcgeary and the
[47:50] saints there
[47:54] but i want to look at this
[47:57] scripture in genesis chapter one
[48:01] and again we we we touched on it this
[48:03] morning a little bit and i just want to
[48:06] maybe bring it right back up to speed
[48:08] because i told you that that service
[48:10] this morning would would lead or tie
[48:13] right into this service this evening and
[48:15] so
[48:16] when we look at genesis chapter 1 and
[48:18] verse 27
[48:20] it says so god created man in his own
[48:22] image in the image of god created he him
[48:26] male and female created he them so this
[48:30] is when god first created
[48:34] man or what the
[48:36] i believe that's the hebrew word adam
[48:39] which actually speaks of mankind
[48:42] adam the first man and we find uh
[48:45] genesis tells us here that
[48:49] when god created this man
[48:51] male and female created he them this one
[48:54] being was both male and female
[48:58] in one
[48:59] one form
[49:01] and so
[49:02] consequently we see that when god formed
[49:05] the first man and we think of him as
[49:07] adam he also created himself his
[49:12] his daughter
[49:14] his first daughter
[49:15] and later he separates that spirit and
[49:19] he cr he pulls from adam a rib
[49:21] and he forms himself another body
[49:25] and adam calls that woman
[49:29] for she came from man
[49:33] and so she was called woman
[49:36] and later after she gives birth
[49:39] he's she is given a name eve the mother
[49:42] of all living but when god first created
[49:46] this being
[49:47] it was both a male and female it was a
[49:50] spirit being
[49:52] adam
[49:53] now
[49:54] uh
[49:58] we're living in such a strange time in
[50:01] this dark age that
[50:03] the world would like to take that and
[50:05] and we've seen how they love have loved
[50:07] twisting
[50:08] you know men being women and women being
[50:10] men and and and
[50:13] and or pick whatever you would like to
[50:15] be a toaster or
[50:16] an animal or whatever you'd like but
[50:19] but this is just the pure word of god
[50:22] and that's what we're looking at we
[50:24] don't want to get wrapped up in what the
[50:25] world is
[50:26] is trying to mimic from god
[50:29] but when god
[50:31] created man he created him a son
[50:34] and when he gave
[50:36] him
[50:36] his son a wife
[50:40] god was gaining himself a daughter
[50:43] he'd gotten for himself
[50:45] a daughter
[50:48] and in genesis chapter 2 and verse 18 it
[50:51] says the lord god said it is not good
[50:55] that the man should be alone i will make
[50:57] him and help meet for him so as i said
[51:00] this morning we see that after each day
[51:03] that god was creating
[51:05] after he'd created the light and and
[51:08] separated the darkness from the light
[51:10] and he called the the the light day and
[51:13] the darkness night
[51:15] and after each day
[51:17] that god
[51:18] goes through the creation
[51:21] he says
[51:22] it is good
[51:24] it is good it is good and at the end he
[51:27] says it is very good but now we see in
[51:30] chapter 2 the lord saying it is not good
[51:34] it is not good
[51:36] that the man should be alone
[51:39] i'll make him and help me for him
[51:50] and
[51:58] i would say this that
[52:00] as i'm presenting this
[52:02] sermon tonight to the church to the
[52:05] daughters of god
[52:08] i would also
[52:10] when these
[52:11] when i'm looking in these scriptures and
[52:13] i'm seeing the things that the prophet
[52:15] of god is saying
[52:18] in my mind and in my heart i'm also
[52:20] thinking
[52:21] what what could i say that i would want
[52:24] my daughters my daughters
[52:26] to know something that would benefit my
[52:29] own daughters so i've got i'm the father
[52:31] of of two daughters and two sons my
[52:35] daughters being the
[52:36] the eldest and so they'll probably exit
[52:40] the home first
[52:41] we don't know
[52:44] i we don't know dad may hold him back
[52:48] but
[52:50] um
[52:52] what what would i want my daughters to
[52:54] know what can my daughters draw from the
[52:57] word of god
[52:58] and what could i say that i would want
[53:02] to encourage my daughters in
[53:04] and when i see here that god
[53:07] said it's not good that man should be
[53:09] alone
[53:11] god is only reflecting something that's
[53:14] within him
[53:16] that perhaps god sees it was not good
[53:19] for him to be alone
[53:22] and therefore we see when god first
[53:24] created
[53:25] one of the first things
[53:27] he created was the angels
[53:30] and that was
[53:31] to gain worship so that there would be
[53:33] worship
[53:35] but but more specifically and more
[53:38] intimately
[53:39] god desired a family
[53:43] and so
[53:44] now we see not just angels but mankind
[53:48] coming into the picture
[53:50] and this mankind coming into this
[53:53] picture
[53:55] for fellowship
[53:59] and
[54:00] i remember i think it was my
[54:02] father-in-law maybe you all know him for
[54:04] the gerald hughes he's a pastor and i
[54:06] remember him using this example and i it
[54:08] always stood out to me
[54:10] and he said you know i believe that we
[54:12] can look into the message of the hour
[54:15] and through the stories and or the life
[54:19] that brother branham lived
[54:22] we can draw examples
[54:24] for
[54:25] for the believer
[54:26] and i say amen to that
[54:28] and then he demonstrated something he
[54:31] pulled a story and i thought boy that is
[54:34] that's really striking and i thought i
[54:36] really like that and i feel like it's
[54:38] applicable so i'll share it with you
[54:41] the story he
[54:42] he presented to me was the story
[54:46] that when
[54:47] when
[54:48] brother branham
[54:50] uh had
[54:53] uh i guess disobeyed god if you would
[54:56] um he god had desired for him to go into
[54:59] minister to the to uh the pentecostal
[55:02] people
[55:03] and
[55:04] uh his mother-in-law
[55:06] said you you're not taking my daughter
[55:10] to that bunch of trash
[55:13] and
[55:15] and he didn't and we know what happened
[55:18] the flood came and his his wife
[55:21] sister hope
[55:22] got sick
[55:24] and
[55:27] and
[55:28] she said to him while she was sick on
[55:30] that bed billy you know where we went
[55:32] wrong don't you and he said yes i do
[55:36] she said we should never listen to mama
[55:39] and she said you go you go preach to
[55:41] those people you go preach this message
[55:43] to those people
[55:48] and
[55:49] she passes away and
[55:51] and he's
[55:53] the the tragedy of losing his wife
[55:56] is just overwhelming but he's because of
[55:58] the emergency of the flood that's
[56:00] happening he's continually having to
[56:02] work it was just i think
[56:04] from my best understanding it was just a
[56:07] matter of days
[56:09] and he gets the call maybe it was
[56:11] hours
[56:14] your daughter's dying
[56:16] your daughter sharon's dying
[56:18] so he rushes to the hospital and i
[56:21] believe it was brother sam adair the
[56:23] doctor
[56:24] who said billy you can't go in there you
[56:26] you know she's got i think tb or
[56:28] something and and you could contract
[56:30] that and then and then you're going to
[56:31] be around billy paul and then he could
[56:33] get that and get sick and die you can't
[56:34] go in there and he
[56:36] he he seems to somewhat agree and as
[56:39] soon as sam turns he goes in he goes in
[56:42] to see sharon anyway and and he you know
[56:45] the story every time i you hear it it
[56:47] just breaks your heart you just can't
[56:48] help but just we
[56:51] that she's suffering
[56:52] so hard the flies are he said the
[56:55] blowflies are in her face and her eyes
[56:57] are crossed from the suffering so hard
[57:01] and then he sees that sheep drop down
[57:04] that god wouldn't answer his prayer even
[57:08] and how the devil came and even
[57:10] whispered how could
[57:12] how could you love god and how could you
[57:14] say god loves you and
[57:20] he loses his daughter
[57:22] and after losing his daughter the
[57:24] tragedy is so great
[57:30] each i believe each person when they
[57:32] hear that story
[57:35] your heart just breaks and you think oh
[57:38] god
[57:39] how could that how could a man live
[57:43] and that's the question brother branham
[57:44] was asking himself
[57:49] with my wife
[57:50] gone
[57:51] and my daughter gone what's the point of
[57:56] living
[57:58] so he goes home and he gets a pistol
[58:02] and he that pistol back and he
[58:03] tries with everything he can to take his
[58:07] own life
[58:11] and the gun will not go off
[58:14] and he throws the gun down and it goes
[58:16] off and he then he's praying to god you
[58:19] won't even let me take my own life
[58:23] and he's at work then i don't know if
[58:26] days weeks later months i'm not sure but
[58:28] he's up on that power line and he sees
[58:30] the shadow and it looks like the cross
[58:33] and he just thinks lord just let me go
[58:36] home and he goes to grab that 10 000
[58:38] volt line
[58:40] and he just wakes up at the base of that
[58:42] power line
[58:47] and the story that was demonstrated to
[58:49] me was
[58:51] when you hear a story like that and you
[58:53] think what's the
[58:55] why would god do that why would god
[58:57] allow that and and when my father
[59:00] demonstrated the story he said notice he
[59:03] was so lonely without his wife and his
[59:06] baby what was the point of living and
[59:08] god
[59:10] god desired
[59:12] that we were to have somebody that adam
[59:15] it was not good that he be alone
[59:18] and god desired a family so much that
[59:22] the prophet of god in the church age
[59:24] book said that the very heart purpose
[59:28] the sole purpose of god's existence was
[59:31] to have a bride of his own choosing
[59:34] was a family
[59:36] was to have sons and daughters
[59:39] that is the very purpose of god's
[59:41] existence
[59:44] and so when i look and i i i realize
[59:47] that that i'm jumping all the way to the
[59:49] end into the punch line but the very
[59:52] purpose of this message is a message for
[59:56] daughters
[1:00:04] here it is
[1:00:05] from the smyrnian church age the heart
[1:00:07] purpose the eternal purpose of god was
[1:00:10] to take a bride of his own choosing and
[1:00:12] that purpose was in himself and being
[1:00:15] eternal was decreed before the
[1:00:18] foundation of the world
[1:00:25] sometimes
[1:00:26] we ask the question why am i here what's
[1:00:29] the purpose of my existence
[1:00:32] and you should be asking the question
[1:00:35] what's the purpose of god's existence
[1:00:38] it's
[1:00:40] you you are his purpose
[1:00:52] i put this scripture here
[1:00:56] because i've got a story behind it
[1:01:00] but i've only highlighted the second
[1:01:01] half of this scripture ruth 4 15 for thy
[1:01:03] daughter-in-law which loveth thee which
[1:01:05] is better to thee than seven sons hath
[1:01:07] borne him
[1:01:15] i remember
[1:01:17] i hope you don't mind me sharing a purse
[1:01:19] some personal stories with you and i
[1:01:20] hope my family isn't too terribly
[1:01:22] embarrassed
[1:01:24] by me telling personal stories they
[1:01:26] should be used to it by now
[1:01:29] but i remember when
[1:01:32] sister grace and i were found interest
[1:01:35] in each other and
[1:01:37] and we were
[1:01:38] uh both had the same the same goal the
[1:01:41] same mindset to serve the lord with all
[1:01:44] with everything that was within us and
[1:01:47] that we weren't um neither one of us
[1:01:49] were looking to
[1:01:51] at the stage in life that we were
[1:01:54] the age we were to just have a friendly
[1:01:57] relationship and just a cordial
[1:02:01] boyfriend girlfriend sort of thing we
[1:02:03] both had agreed that if we were to enter
[1:02:05] into uh any sort of a relationship it
[1:02:08] would be for the intent the sole intent
[1:02:11] of marriage that we didn't want to we
[1:02:13] didn't want to
[1:02:14] we didn't want to go a long way of
[1:02:16] trying to figure that out we just
[1:02:18] if we're doing this is what we're going
[1:02:20] for
[1:02:22] and so
[1:02:23] we would she being in south carolina and
[1:02:26] i'm here in arizona two thousand miles
[1:02:28] distance and back then uh cell phones
[1:02:30] were hardly a thing that existed that's
[1:02:33] not true but for us they were
[1:02:36] my dad had one i think in a bag in his
[1:02:38] truck but you they were like a hundred
[1:02:40] dollars a minute or something like that
[1:02:42] but anyways we didn't we had cell phones
[1:02:45] but they were very
[1:02:46] old
[1:02:48] and so we didn't talk in in even when we
[1:02:51] did wanted to talk her her father my
[1:02:54] father-in-law
[1:02:56] uh
[1:02:57] decided
[1:02:58] once a week for 30 minutes that could be
[1:03:00] your phone time and so we resorted to a
[1:03:03] lot of letter writing and and emails
[1:03:06] the best that we could
[1:03:09] but we would be praying lord are we
[1:03:11] meant to be are we meant to be married
[1:03:14] god we want your perfect will show us in
[1:03:16] the word show us when we're listening to
[1:03:19] the tapes god speak to us to confirm
[1:03:22] that we are meant to be married
[1:03:25] we would we would pray diligently and
[1:03:28] seek god and and of course every message
[1:03:31] i'm picking out is love
[1:03:33] and
[1:03:33] anything to do the kinsmen redeemer and
[1:03:36] anything that had to do with a man and a
[1:03:38] woman getting married those were the
[1:03:39] ones i was going to listen to first
[1:03:42] and it was like
[1:03:44] and i felt like i'd already it been
[1:03:47] confirmed to me she's supposed to be
[1:03:49] your wife and and i would ask her well
[1:03:51] how do you feel what is the lord showing
[1:03:52] you i believe we're meant to be together
[1:03:55] and i remember thinking well lord what
[1:03:57] why doesn't her dad get it
[1:04:02] god opened his eyes
[1:04:06] and
[1:04:06] and i guess being young and and
[1:04:10] naive i don't want to use the word dumb
[1:04:12] in front of our children but really
[1:04:15] it's really what it was but
[1:04:17] i just you know being young and maybe
[1:04:19] arrogant or something i didn't feel like
[1:04:21] i was but maybe that's what it was i
[1:04:24] don't know
[1:04:25] it's real easy to do that once you're
[1:04:27] older but
[1:04:30] you know i'm thinking why would he
[1:04:33] why would he not
[1:04:35] want to just hand his daughter right
[1:04:37] over to me
[1:04:41] i mean
[1:04:44] what is his problem why can't he just
[1:04:46] you know and and the idea the dream for
[1:04:49] every young man that's that's grown up
[1:04:51] sleeping under these pews here in the a
[1:04:54] message believing church
[1:04:55] every dream of every young man
[1:04:59] is the idea that he's going to go to his
[1:05:01] future father-in-law the man that he's
[1:05:04] daughter he's dating the daughter and
[1:05:06] he's just gonna walk up to her to that
[1:05:09] man and he's just gonna say you can have
[1:05:11] him bill you can have her
[1:05:14] you can have her bill and but you know
[1:05:16] changing out the name you can have a reg
[1:05:19] oh thank you of course
[1:05:21] we're the chums right
[1:05:23] but that's not how it works
[1:05:26] most of the time i
[1:05:28] didn't work for me
[1:05:32] and
[1:05:34] the end story is we ended up getting
[1:05:36] married
[1:05:37] i don't know if you knew the happy
[1:05:38] ending but we were married
[1:05:41] and it worked out
[1:05:43] well
[1:05:44] then
[1:05:46] it came time where we found out we're
[1:05:49] gonna have a child our first child we're
[1:05:52] gonna have a child well i was so excited
[1:05:55] you know and
[1:05:56] the thought to me was

[1:06:05] you know the baseball glove because me
[1:06:07] and my son we're gonna go and do this
[1:06:09] and then week i think 20 comes along and
[1:06:12] and they say oh you got to go to the
[1:06:14] doctor and find out what you're having
[1:06:17] and it was a human
[1:06:20] and
[1:06:22] and i'm going oh yeah well of course
[1:06:24] let's go to the doctor and hear him say
[1:06:26] it's a boy let's just go let's just say
[1:06:28] yeah that's what we're gonna go
[1:06:29] and
[1:06:30] congratulations you're going to have a
[1:06:32] daughter
[1:06:37] and i thought
[1:06:38] what
[1:06:40] no that's not how that's supposed to
[1:06:41] work
[1:06:43] it's a boy
[1:06:44] what do i what i don't what do i have
[1:06:46] use of what use do i have of a daughter
[1:06:49] what do you do with a daughter
[1:06:52] i don't even know what
[1:06:54] they can't hardly catch you know i i
[1:06:57] just don't how is this gonna work out
[1:07:00] and i was so taken back and i think even
[1:07:02] my wife noticed it and was like you're
[1:07:05] not happy
[1:07:07] and i was like no i am of course i'm
[1:07:09] happy i'm happy and i'm trying to you
[1:07:12] know convince myself that i am happy
[1:07:16] and then
[1:07:17] we had our daughter
[1:07:20] and
[1:07:22] the doctors you know it's traumatic
[1:07:24] experience for any man to be there
[1:07:26] just warning any men that have not been
[1:07:29] it's very traumatic
[1:07:30] and they take the
[1:07:32] baby over to here and they're sucking
[1:07:34] the you know to stuff out of its mouth
[1:07:36] to get it and it's and you want to come
[1:07:38] and hold your daughter
[1:07:40] and you're hey yeah yeah
[1:07:42] you go over and here is this little tiny
[1:07:45] bundle of joy and the second they put
[1:07:49] that baby in my hands
[1:07:52] there's this magic invisible lasso
[1:07:56] that daughters have and they wrap it
[1:07:58] right around the heart of dad
[1:08:02] and it's daddy's girl
[1:08:05] and immediately
[1:08:07] immediately
[1:08:11] i thought of my father-in-law
[1:08:14] and i thought
[1:08:16] now i understand
[1:08:20] why he wouldn't just hand his daughter
[1:08:24] right over to me and say here you go you
[1:08:27] know just she's all yours
[1:08:30] and it all became clear to me
[1:08:35] what that
[1:08:37] whole responsibility of being a dad to
[1:08:40] his daughter was
[1:08:45] and when i read this scripture for thy
[1:08:48] daughter-in-law which loveth thee is
[1:08:50] better to thee than seven sons
[1:08:53] hath borne him
[1:08:56] i
[1:08:58] will be honest
[1:09:00] if you'd asked me if you were if i was
[1:09:03] writing the book of reg
[1:09:06] 415 b
[1:09:08] would say
[1:09:10] a dozen sons
[1:09:13] i wouldn't have traded 12 boys
[1:09:15] for the one girl that i had
[1:09:17] i wouldn't have traded it that one girl
[1:09:21] was meant more to me
[1:09:23] than if i'd had 12 boys
[1:09:32] now this is from the message the kinsman
[1:09:36] redeemer
[1:09:37] i should maybe hide that so you can't
[1:09:39] see that
[1:09:41] but i want to tell you there's a there
[1:09:43] is a difference between boys and girls
[1:09:45] when you have sons and daughters and
[1:09:49] with sons
[1:09:51] i remember our oldest son isaiah
[1:09:55] i i can promise you he'd never seen any
[1:10:00] anything any any sort of a cartoon
[1:10:03] anything
[1:10:04] uh
[1:10:09] he hadn't watched any hunting programs
[1:10:11] with dad or i promise nothing
[1:10:14] and i can remember when he was just a
[1:10:16] few months old him picking up a hanger
[1:10:18] on our bed
[1:10:19] and aiming that hanger and going
[1:10:26] and i thought how does he know that
[1:10:29] how does he
[1:10:31] how does he put that together the hangar
[1:10:34] and the arrow and shooting how does he
[1:10:36] know that none of my daughters ever did
[1:10:39] that
[1:10:40] they never did it they never they may
[1:10:43] have danced with a hanger but they did
[1:10:45] not
[1:10:46] use the hanger like a gun or or a bow
[1:10:48] and arrow
[1:10:50] and i say that to say this
[1:10:52] when when when you have your boys and
[1:10:54] you go to church and you raise them up
[1:10:56] in church and you ask the boys
[1:10:58] who's your favorite bible character the
[1:11:02] answers are almost always the same david
[1:11:07] sampson
[1:11:11] shamgar anybody that kills philistines
[1:11:14] anybody that'll kill a philistine that's
[1:11:16] a boy's favorite character jesus moses
[1:11:22] boys i know my bible jesus wasn't
[1:11:24] killing philistines i'm just saying
[1:11:26] those are the typical answers
[1:11:28] that is given by boys
[1:11:30] but when you have daughters
[1:11:33] the answers are usually always the same
[1:11:36] girls who's your favorite bible
[1:11:38] character esther
[1:11:41] ruth
[1:11:43] mary
[1:11:44] sarah rebecca
[1:11:48] those are typically
[1:11:50] the ant those are the answers you get
[1:11:52] from daughters
[1:11:55] well it always seems the girls always
[1:11:58] seem to say things like i think it's
[1:11:59] unfair i think there's more examples for
[1:12:01] the boys in the bible than there is
[1:12:03] girls i say well just enjoy the examples
[1:12:05] that are given
[1:12:06] in in there and
[1:12:08] i want to look at what brother branham
[1:12:12] says here in the kinsman redeemer and he
[1:12:14] speaks of of two of those characters
[1:12:16] ruth and rebecca and he nails both at
[1:12:19] the same time
[1:12:21] and you'll find there's many many times
[1:12:23] brother branham does mention rebecca and
[1:12:26] he and he uses the same example
[1:12:28] concerning rebecca
[1:12:30] but let's notice what he says here in
[1:12:32] the kinsman redeemer
[1:12:33] well
[1:12:34] lord if you'll just bless me
[1:12:37] and do this for me i'll do so and so
[1:12:41] that's not a decision now he's speaking
[1:12:43] as if that would be us
[1:12:45] well lord if you'll just bless me and do
[1:12:46] this for me i'll do so and so
[1:12:50] that's not a decision god i don't care
[1:12:54] what you do with me
[1:12:56] i'll go anyhow
[1:12:58] if i die all right live or die whatever
[1:13:01] if they laugh at me make fun of me don't
[1:13:04] make any difference i'll go anyhow
[1:13:07] that's clean cut decision like rebecca
[1:13:11] made before she even seen isaac
[1:13:16] remember she'd never seen isaac but
[1:13:18] she'd heard from a messenger
[1:13:20] all about isaac
[1:13:23] and when she was asked the question will
[1:13:26] you go be married to this man you've
[1:13:28] never seen
[1:13:30] she real quickly they said look let's
[1:13:32] not ask let's let's ask the girl herself
[1:13:36] will you go be married to this man and
[1:13:39] real quickly the bible says quit quickly
[1:13:42] she said i'll go.
[1:13:44] and brother branham is saying i like
[1:13:46] that
[1:13:47] i like that when the when the when the
[1:13:50] uh opportunity is presented for a
[1:13:53] believer will you serve this jesus
[1:13:56] christ that you've heard so much about
[1:13:59] will this this jesus be your lord will
[1:14:02] he be your savior
[1:14:05] he says i like when a christian when a
[1:14:07] believer can make a clean cut decision
[1:14:09] and say i'll go
[1:14:11] i'll serve
[1:14:12] him her parents said let the girl answer
[1:14:15] the girl she is of age let her answer
[1:14:17] she said i'll go clean cut decision
[1:14:20] quickly she made she claimed to it
[1:14:22] that's what ruth did
[1:14:25] orpah went back
[1:14:26] they journeyed on ruth in her heart not
[1:14:29] knowing where she was going but a type
[1:14:31] of the church
[1:14:32] we sojourn like abraham pilgrims in a
[1:14:36] strange land among strange people
[1:14:39] and i say i i brought this out for for
[1:14:42] this purpose
[1:14:45] i'm so thankful when my when my
[1:14:48] daughters
[1:14:49] say my favorite story is is esther my
[1:14:52] favorite story is ruth i like ruth well
[1:14:56] then i want to prod a little bit and say
[1:14:57] well why what about him what
[1:15:00] well i like that brother branham says
[1:15:03] what i like about s or what i like about
[1:15:06] ruth and what i like about rebecca was
[1:15:08] the clean-cut decision they made
[1:15:11] i'm gonna break this lamp by the end of
[1:15:13] this service
[1:15:16] i'll back up
[1:15:17] they made a clean-cut decision i'll go
[1:15:19] ruth
[1:15:20] ruth said i'll go where you go i'll go
[1:15:24] let your people be my people your god my
[1:15:26] god where you die i wanna die there do
[1:15:30] not let me separate from you naomi
[1:15:39] and as a father with two daughters
[1:15:44] there's nothing
[1:15:45] there's i should i say one of the things
[1:15:49] that i a lesson a deci something that i
[1:15:52] want my daughters to have in their life
[1:15:55] is a clean cut decision for jesus christ
[1:16:02] not because mom
[1:16:03] does not because dad does but them
[1:16:07] themselves make that decision
[1:16:10] i will live
[1:16:12] i choose to be a christian
[1:16:16] i choose that
[1:16:21] that's
[1:16:22] that's the first step we want for
[1:16:24] believers
[1:16:26] is don't do this wishy-washy thing
[1:16:29] of today on sundays and wednesdays i'll
[1:16:32] serve jesus but give me my mondays
[1:16:36] tuesdays thursdays fridays and saturdays
[1:16:38] that i can go and live in the world
[1:16:42] no
[1:16:43] no
[1:16:45] that's not that's not a healthy
[1:16:47] relationship
[1:16:50] you know brother branham said one time
[1:16:52] many people will choose
[1:16:55] will
[1:16:56] will choose jesus christ
[1:16:59] as their savior
[1:17:01] but very few will receive him as lord
[1:17:05] and lord is a lordship over you
[1:17:10] is him having
[1:17:12] having the preeminence the
[1:17:14] having him having the control in a man
[1:17:17] or a woman's life
[1:17:21] a surrendered life to christ
[1:17:34] there's a story
[1:17:37] there's a couple stories in the bible
[1:17:39] and
[1:17:40] there's one story that i think is used
[1:17:43] more than any other story in the message
[1:17:45] of the hour
[1:17:46] and that is the story of the woman at
[1:17:49] the well
[1:17:51] and it's it's a story that's used
[1:17:54] i believe
[1:17:56] probably more times
[1:17:57] than any in the message of the hour for
[1:18:00] for the purpose of demonstrating the
[1:18:03] sign of the messiah
[1:18:06] because we recognize
[1:18:08] that the same god
[1:18:10] that was able to tell nathanael
[1:18:14] that thou art a a an israelite in whom
[1:18:17] there is no guile and and nathanael said
[1:18:20] how do you know me he said i saw you
[1:18:22] before philip called you i saw you
[1:18:24] praying under the tree
[1:18:26] and nathanael
[1:18:28] knowing that that was miles away that
[1:18:30] jesus himself was not physically there
[1:18:33] how could he see that but that through a
[1:18:35] vision
[1:18:36] god showed him
[1:18:38] nathanael
[1:18:40] and then we we
[1:18:42] we
[1:18:43] see also him doing this to simon to to
[1:18:47] peter calling him simon thou art simon
[1:18:49] the son of jonas
[1:18:51] and and and him using this on to the
[1:18:54] jews demonstrating the sign of the
[1:18:56] messiah and then we see it with this
[1:18:58] woman the samaritan at the well
[1:19:02] and how that he begins talking with her
[1:19:04] to catch her spirit
[1:19:06] and we realize that once he catches her
[1:19:09] spirit he
[1:19:10] he identifies a problem in her life
[1:19:13] and that problem in her life was a
[1:19:15] marital problem and he tells her about
[1:19:17] this marital problem and when he begins
[1:19:20] to spell out to her this marital problem
[1:19:23] she recognizes that this must be now if
[1:19:27] you take your scriptures and you will
[1:19:29] run it back she says thou
[1:19:32] thou must be a prophet but brother
[1:19:34] branham points out and you can you can
[1:19:36] discover this yourself if you'll take
[1:19:38] the hebrew and you'll take that
[1:19:40] reference it's not a prophet but the
[1:19:42] prophet
[1:19:44] thou art that prophet
[1:19:46] and that prophet is a reference back to
[1:19:49] deuteronomy where god says to moses that
[1:19:52] i will raise up a prophet like unto thee
[1:19:54] moses and him shall the people hear and
[1:19:57] this was the first
[1:19:58] this was the prophecy of the messiah
[1:20:01] and the jews recognized that they
[1:20:03] recognize that that is a reference to
[1:20:05] the messiah well this samaritan is using
[1:20:08] that reference
[1:20:10] of that prophet that that messiah and
[1:20:14] jesus says i am he that speaks to you
[1:20:18] now we see that that that that example
[1:20:20] is used because of the sign of the
[1:20:22] messiah but what we
[1:20:25] what i would like to recognize and
[1:20:27] brother branham points this out when he
[1:20:30] is talking about the representation
[1:20:34] or the seed gene of god
[1:20:38] that is in a man or a woman
[1:20:41] that was placed
[1:20:42] that god had
[1:20:44] before the foundation
[1:20:46] of the world
[1:20:48] you can discover this in ephesians
[1:20:50] chapter one the predestination and
[1:20:51] foreknowledge of god and that before the
[1:20:54] foundation of the world god put your
[1:20:56] name on a book
[1:20:58] and so before the foundation of the
[1:21:00] world god had representation of you you
[1:21:04] had representation in god
[1:21:08] and then god
[1:21:09] sowed that seed and that seed
[1:21:13] through generations how brother branham
[1:21:16] talks about how that god foreordained
[1:21:18] that your great-grandparents your
[1:21:20] grandparents your parents would would
[1:21:24] all come together to form
[1:21:26] you and that god desired that in you
[1:21:30] there would be one of those seed genes
[1:21:36] he talks about that representation
[1:21:38] and he just happens to say that this
[1:21:41] woman at the well had one of those seed
[1:21:43] jeans inside of her
[1:21:45] and he said now look at the priest the
[1:21:47] priest's life that was there in that
[1:21:50] city his life was so clean
[1:21:53] he followed the laws that were written
[1:21:56] by moses and david he followed those
[1:21:58] laws to a t
[1:22:00] to where you couldn't put a finger on
[1:22:03] his life
[1:22:04] but his heart
[1:22:06] was as black as the smutty walls of hell
[1:22:12] but this woman whose life
[1:22:15] seemed to be tarnished seemed to be
[1:22:16] ruined her outside condition seemed to
[1:22:20] be black as the smutty walls of hell yet
[1:22:23] in her heart
[1:22:25] it was pure it was clean and it had one
[1:22:28] of those seed gene representations in
[1:22:32] her heart
[1:22:33] so that when the word of god
[1:22:36] spoke to her and said i am that messiah
[1:22:39] and begin to tell her the very things in
[1:22:41] her life she recognized this is of god
[1:22:45] and when she recognized that he said i
[1:22:48] come to give you water that you can't
[1:22:51] draw from this well but i'll give you
[1:22:53] waters of life springing up from inside
[1:22:56] of you
[1:22:57] and these are waters of eternal life
[1:23:00] she believed his words
[1:23:02] she believed what he was saying was true
[1:23:05] and when she believed it and received it
[1:23:09] for herself
[1:23:10] she
[1:23:12] was manifesting that she was a daughter
[1:23:15] of god all along
[1:23:24] we see the same in mary magdalene
[1:23:28] we we see these examples throughout the
[1:23:30] bible when you see these women whose
[1:23:33] lives seem to be tarnished
[1:23:36] yet
[1:23:37] they were willing to
[1:23:40] to receive the word of god in their life
[1:23:49] so as we look through these characters
[1:23:52] in the bible these different daughters
[1:23:55] that are spoken of in the bible
[1:23:59] they're placed there
[1:24:01] to draw our attention
[1:24:08] for the church
[1:24:10] to identify the church
[1:24:12] to identify the bride
[1:24:18] but
[1:24:20] before we can identify the church
[1:24:24] we must properly identify the bridegroom
[1:24:29] and if we can properly identify in the
[1:24:32] word of god the bridegroom
[1:24:35] then
[1:24:36] then we can properly place
[1:24:39] the bride in her place because she does
[1:24:43] have a position
[1:24:46] but if we only
[1:24:48] focus on the position of the bride and
[1:24:51] we we fail
[1:24:52] to properly identify the bride groom and
[1:24:56] put him in his rightful place
[1:24:58] we will we will run off into a tangent
[1:25:03] and run off on a bunny trail
[1:25:05] and
[1:25:06] we'll draw worship away from god and
[1:25:09] that
[1:25:10] is what satan desired at the beginning
[1:25:16] satan the most beautiful of all the
[1:25:17] cherubims desired uh does his his end
[1:25:21] desire was to receive the very worship
[1:25:25] that was due to god
[1:25:26] and the way he could do that was to
[1:25:29] first draw the worship away from god
[1:25:33] and then through time
[1:25:35] that worship in turn could be turned and
[1:25:39] he could pull that worship and attention
[1:25:42] to himself
[1:25:45] that's a sermon in itself we're not
[1:25:48] going to go there
[1:25:53] but i'm but something that
[1:25:55] even though i'm i'm i'm preaching a
[1:25:58] sermon here about a message to daughters
[1:26:00] we must always remember that when
[1:26:04] identifying the daughters and when
[1:26:06] recognizing who we are in the word of
[1:26:08] god we must first recognize who he is
[1:26:14] and give him the preeminence
[1:26:20] now there's not only
[1:26:23] characters in the bible that we would
[1:26:25] desire our daughters
[1:26:27] to identify with
[1:26:30] these esthers these ruths these rebeccas
[1:26:33] these marys
[1:26:34] this woman at the well we we we we like
[1:26:37] that our daughters would identify but
[1:26:39] the scripture is also
[1:26:41] it gives us enough examples of daughters
[1:26:44] that we we that are are clearly put in
[1:26:48] the scripture to be examples of what we
[1:26:50] don't want our daughters to be
[1:26:53] and i think it's good to have that
[1:26:55] balance if we just simply said now you
[1:26:57] need to be like that you need to be like
[1:26:59] that you need to be like
[1:27:02] that well what do they not need to be
[1:27:05] that might help that law of contrast
[1:27:08] might help clarify what they ought to be
[1:27:11] and so we look at characters
[1:27:14] like jezebel and we see that jezebel
[1:27:17] also had a daughter
[1:27:19] named athaliah
[1:27:21] that's how i pronounce it if you like to
[1:27:23] pronounce it another way atholize how i
[1:27:25] pronounce it
[1:27:26] and
[1:27:27] jezebel being married to ahab
[1:27:31] jezebel brought idolatry into the ten
[1:27:34] tribes of israel
[1:27:35] now the two tribes of that were
[1:27:38] of judah they stayed clean and they had
[1:27:41] a king jehoshaphat and he was always
[1:27:44] when ahab would say we should join
[1:27:45] forces we should join forces jehoshaphat
[1:27:48] would say well have we consulted god
[1:27:50] about this have we consulted we should
[1:27:51] consult god about this
[1:27:53] and he was very he was very uh
[1:27:56] word oriented and seeking the will of
[1:27:58] god jehoshaphat
[1:28:01] well
[1:28:03] jehoshaphat had a son jehoram and
[1:28:06] this was very common that nations would
[1:28:10] would would intermarry to strengthen
[1:28:12] relationships
[1:28:16] help strengthen nations themselves
[1:28:19] and jehoshaphat's son jehoram ended up
[1:28:22] marrying ahab and jezebel's daughter
[1:28:25] athaliah
[1:28:27] and when he did the same idolatry that
[1:28:30] jezebel brought into israel
[1:28:34] athaliah brought it
[1:28:36] into judah
[1:28:41] there's a real beautiful picture of that
[1:28:43] in the church age book brother branham
[1:28:45] talks about this and he brings it in and
[1:28:47] it's
[1:28:48] very rich and very full and i would
[1:28:50] encourage you to go and and and seek
[1:28:52] that out but for the sake of time i want
[1:28:54] to move on another daughter that we see
[1:28:58] is herodias
[1:29:01] and her daughter
[1:29:02] now herodias if we if you'll remember
[1:29:05] this is in the new testament now
[1:29:07] we see her uh
[1:29:11] in a
[1:29:12] an unlawful union with
[1:29:17] i don't remember if it was herod
[1:29:21] and
[1:29:22] john the baptist is crying out against
[1:29:24] it
[1:29:25] this is wrong this is wrong this is
[1:29:27] wrong
[1:29:30] and herodias gets her daughter
[1:29:33] to go dance
[1:29:34] before this king
[1:29:37] and he says if you if you'll dance i'll
[1:29:39] give you whatever you want so then she
[1:29:41] dances and it pleases the king so much
[1:29:43] he says what is it that you want and she
[1:29:45] talks to her mother and she says i want
[1:29:47] the head of john the baptist on a
[1:29:49] platter
[1:29:50] now i think any fathers in here
[1:29:53] i think you would say i don't want my
[1:29:55] daughter to be like that
[1:29:58] that is not what i want my daughter to
[1:30:00] be
[1:30:02] we read in revelations chapter 17 about
[1:30:05] this woman called mystery babylon
[1:30:08] and the bible calls her a great
[1:30:10] and it said that she was a daughter that
[1:30:12] she had daughters she was the mother of
[1:30:14] harlots
[1:30:16] so we see her daughters
[1:30:18] following right in the same line as the
[1:30:20] mother
[1:30:24] now these are the examples that we could
[1:30:26] set before our daughters that i would
[1:30:28] set before my daughters and say now this
[1:30:31] if we look at this these scriptural
[1:30:34] examples i don't want you to end up like
[1:30:38] this
[1:30:39] and so contrarily i would want you to be
[1:30:42] like somebody like esther
[1:30:45] and what we're seeing is in in in the
[1:30:47] life of jezebel and ethelia and herodias
[1:30:50] her daughter in and this mystery babylon
[1:30:53] and her daughters is this unholiness it
[1:30:56] was very unholy ungodly ungodliness
[1:31:05] and
[1:31:06] when we read a scripture
[1:31:08] in isaiah chapter 3 and verse 16 it says
[1:31:12] moreover the lord saith because the
[1:31:14] daughters of zion are haughty and walk
[1:31:17] with stretched forth necks and wanton
[1:31:20] eyes
[1:31:21] walking and mincing as they go and
[1:31:25] making a tinkling with their
[1:31:28] feet it paints a pretty vivid picture in
[1:31:32] our mind
[1:31:34] that oh my this is so ungodly
[1:31:38] and
[1:31:39] immediately when i read this scripture
[1:31:41] and i get to that part of
[1:31:44] mincing as they go and making a tinkling
[1:31:47] with their feet i'm immediately drawn to
[1:31:50] a story brother branham tells about his
[1:31:53] mother who had a dream i believe it was
[1:31:55] his mother that had this dream and she
[1:31:57] saw this he saw this woman maybe it was
[1:32:00] brother brandon they had this he saw
[1:32:01] this woman and she's walking along and
[1:32:03] she's wearing high heels and she's
[1:32:05] claiming to be the church
[1:32:07] and she's walking with high heels and
[1:32:09] she begins and
[1:32:11] says she's mincing as she goes and he
[1:32:14] says that's what high heels do they
[1:32:16] cause a woman to mince
[1:32:18] he says she's mincing as she's going and
[1:32:20] she's climbing this hill and as she's
[1:32:23] climbing this hill the the path gets
[1:32:26] narrower and narrower and she's and this
[1:32:28] woman can is is convinced and says i can
[1:32:32] walk that i can walk it and as she's
[1:32:35] walking it and the path gets narrower
[1:32:37] because of her mincing in those heels
[1:32:39] she can't walk it and she falls off
[1:32:42] these cliffs into hell
[1:32:46] and so
[1:32:48] now we've got this image and
[1:32:50] and when you hear something like that
[1:32:52] immediately i'm running home and i'm
[1:32:53] telling my daughters no high heels
[1:32:55] whatever we do give me give me your
[1:32:56] shoes we're chopping we're chopping
[1:32:59] we gotta stay like whatever you do stay
[1:33:01] away from that image
[1:33:06] and so the thing
[1:33:08] one again one of the things that i would
[1:33:10] desire
[1:33:11] a message that i would want for my
[1:33:14] daughters
[1:33:15] is a message of holiness is a message of
[1:33:18] clean living
[1:33:21] to be clean
[1:33:28] and i believe when when we approach the
[1:33:32] subject of holiness
[1:33:35] when
[1:33:36] the world thinks
[1:33:38] as soon as you use that word we're
[1:33:40] taught you're talking about a dress code
[1:33:44] holiness because you can go amongst the
[1:33:47] baptists and the pentecostals the
[1:33:49] charismatics and when you say oh they
[1:33:50] believe in holiness they know that
[1:33:53] really what you're saying
[1:33:55] is a dress code a way of dressing
[1:33:59] and i believe that we have been taught
[1:34:02] scripturally that holiness is a way of
[1:34:06] life
[1:34:09] and that when you even look at the word
[1:34:12] holiness it comes from the same word as
[1:34:14] sanctification and that sanctification
[1:34:17] is to be clean
[1:34:19] and set aside for service
[1:34:22] to be used in service
[1:34:24] but it's to it's come out and be
[1:34:28] separate it's that separation
[1:34:31] from worldliness
[1:34:33] now that that applies to a dress code
[1:34:36] and brother branham says don't ever quit
[1:34:38] preaching that
[1:34:39] but it starts with a life
[1:34:43] style
[1:34:44] and i believe that in holiness
[1:34:48] if the life
[1:34:50] and the
[1:34:51] the heart of my daughters and the heart
[1:34:54] of the daughters of zion if their heart
[1:34:56] if their necks are not stretched out and
[1:34:59] they're and and they're not walking in
[1:35:01] haughtiness with wanton eyes
[1:35:04] you won't have to worry about the dress
[1:35:08] it follows a life
[1:35:13] and i like to use
[1:35:15] the contrast from these examples of
[1:35:18] these women whose lifestyles was ungodly
[1:35:23] and and and we can see in jezebel it
[1:35:25] reflected also in her being the only
[1:35:28] woman in the bible to put makeup on her
[1:35:30] face and that makeup she put on her face
[1:35:32] was to meet a man
[1:35:34] jehu
[1:35:36] it was to please him it was to please
[1:35:38] jehu
[1:35:40] but when we see this the contrast in my
[1:35:42] opinion is esther the story of esther
[1:35:46] and you'll find in the story of esther
[1:35:49] that when she when when when king
[1:35:51] ahasuerus puts away vashti from being
[1:35:54] queen and he calls for all the young
[1:35:56] maidens of the land to come and who will
[1:35:59] be the next queen
[1:36:01] and it comes to this point where he's
[1:36:03] going to call each of these girls in
[1:36:06] before his presence
[1:36:08] and and he's going to they're each going
[1:36:11] to try to find and win favor with the
[1:36:15] king
[1:36:16] well when it comes time for esther to
[1:36:18] come before the king they call her up
[1:36:20] and they say esther it's your time to go
[1:36:22] before the king she goes to the
[1:36:25] chamberlain she goes to the king's
[1:36:28] messenger and she goes before him and
[1:36:31] she asks him
[1:36:33] you tell me
[1:36:35] what i should wear
[1:36:37] before the king
[1:36:40] her desire was not well i think he'll be
[1:36:43] pleased with this well i believe he'll
[1:36:46] like this she didn't even bother with
[1:36:49] that
[1:36:50] she went to somebody that knew the king
[1:36:53] and she said you tell me what would
[1:36:56] please the king
[1:36:58] and whence when she dressed in the
[1:37:01] apparel that the chamberlain suggested
[1:37:05] that she wear and she went before the
[1:37:07] king
[1:37:07] the scripture declares that she
[1:37:10] found favor before the king
[1:37:14] and i just love that story because for
[1:37:17] my daughters i've told them this and i
[1:37:19] tell all the young people that i can
[1:37:22] when
[1:37:23] when they
[1:37:24] when they want to know the testimony and
[1:37:26] they want to know about uh serving god
[1:37:29] and and how do you know when god is
[1:37:31] calling you in and and
[1:37:33] know all these things that are in my
[1:37:34] life that are pulling in my life music
[1:37:36] and and and whatever else it would be
[1:37:39] i always my answer is always this
[1:37:42] you fall in love
[1:37:45] with jesus christ
[1:37:47] i mean head over heels in love with
[1:37:51] jesus christ
[1:37:54] and when you do that
[1:37:56] it'll take care of
[1:37:58] all of the rest
[1:37:59] that's which which is exactly what jesus
[1:38:02] said seek ye first the kingdom of heaven
[1:38:04] and his righteousness and all these
[1:38:06] things will be added unto you but i tell
[1:38:08] you fall in love with him
[1:38:11] fall in love with jesus
[1:38:13] to where you just can't do without your
[1:38:16] bible you just couldn't live
[1:38:18] without
[1:38:20] you know any sort of involvement you
[1:38:22] want you want god to be a part of it
[1:38:26] when you can fall in love with him
[1:38:31] then everything else in your life it'll
[1:38:33] lie now
[1:38:35] the music
[1:38:36] the whatever issues that you would think
[1:38:38] that you've got the other cares of life
[1:38:40] they'll go away
[1:38:42] or they'll fall in line
[1:38:48] second corinthians chapter 6 says and
[1:38:50] what agreement hath the temple of god
[1:38:53] with idols
[1:38:54] for ye are
[1:38:56] the temple of the living god as god hath
[1:38:58] said i will dwell in them and walk in
[1:39:02] them and i will be their god and they
[1:39:04] shall be my people wherefore
[1:39:06] come out from among them and be ye
[1:39:09] separate saith the lord and touch not
[1:39:11] the unclean thing and i will receive you
[1:39:15] and will be a father unto you and ye
[1:39:17] shall be my sons and daughters
[1:39:21] saith the lord almighty
[1:39:36] so as i said this morning
[1:39:45] i
[1:39:48] i would i would always want to preach
[1:39:50] something
[1:39:54] that will
[1:39:58] that we can walk in tomorrow or tuesday
[1:40:01] like we walk in it on a sunday
[1:40:05] we can walk in it on friday night as if
[1:40:08] we're walking in it sunday morning
[1:40:12] and i use the word practical purpose
[1:40:15] i believe that the gospel should have
[1:40:18] practical purpose in our lives
[1:40:22] and that's my desire for my household
[1:40:24] for my children
[1:40:26] is that this isn't uh uh a message
[1:40:30] that my daughters can never attain to
[1:40:32] just you gotta you gotta get a little
[1:40:34] bit higher we i call it the golden
[1:40:37] carrot and i think you've probably heard
[1:40:38] me mention that before it's where you
[1:40:40] put that stick and that carrot right in
[1:40:42] front of the donkey and it just keeps
[1:40:44] him going forward and he's constantly
[1:40:46] trying to eat that carrot but he can't
[1:40:48] ever get to it because it's tied to a
[1:40:50] stick and it's always before but it's
[1:40:52] it's this thing that's constantly if you
[1:40:54] just come up a little bit higher no no
[1:40:56] no a little bit hot no
[1:40:59] higher no a little bit higher and you
[1:41:02] can never attain to that and i believe
[1:41:05] that god came in this hour that god
[1:41:10] sent us a message that brings practical
[1:41:14] purpose to the believer
[1:41:17] that the church for too long was
[1:41:19] shrouded in this you can never attain
[1:41:22] you can never attain oh if only you
[1:41:24] could if only you could see what i'm
[1:41:27] seeing if only you could see what i'm
[1:41:29] seeing and the believers going when am i
[1:41:31] ever going to see what you're seeing
[1:41:34] i believe god sent a prophet to say
[1:41:37] let's look into this do you see what i'm
[1:41:40] seeing
[1:41:41] i believe you are i believe you do
[1:41:44] so when we look at this practical
[1:41:46] purpose
[1:41:50] i'm coming to a close
[1:41:57] i want to i want to read to you
[1:42:02] something that's in the questions and
[1:42:04] answers and i believe that it speaks to
[1:42:07] our practical
[1:42:09] everyday life
[1:42:14] this is in questions and answers number
[1:42:16] three in 1964.
[1:42:18] the question is asked would you please
[1:42:20] explain first corinthians chapter 7
[1:42:23] verse 1 and 9.
[1:42:25] and
[1:42:26] brother branham when he goes to read the
[1:42:27] scripture he asks brother neville can
[1:42:29] you grab that scripture and
[1:42:32] and then he all he reads is
[1:42:35] verse 9.
[1:42:36] this is all he reads
[1:42:38] but if they cannot contain
[1:42:40] let them marry for it is better to marry
[1:42:44] than to burn
[1:42:46] brother brahm says all right
[1:42:48] that's just for the dirty living
[1:42:50] instead of a man a boy girl or something
[1:42:53] or another when they're going together
[1:42:55] and they know that they should be
[1:42:56] married go ahead and get married
[1:42:59] i think you'd understand what i mean
[1:43:01] don't you see
[1:43:03] so
[1:43:05] i think we understand what he's saying
[1:43:06] here too that's for the that's that's
[1:43:09] for uh the ungodly the for the dirty
[1:43:12] that's just for dirty living instead of
[1:43:15] just living a dirty life you should just
[1:43:17] get married
[1:43:19] don't just live a dirty little life
[1:43:22] there because it's not right you see
[1:43:25] that's your sister in one sense
[1:43:28] where if you're a christian
[1:43:30] now if it's the world it's the world dog
[1:43:33] eat dog
[1:43:35] but this girl that you're going with
[1:43:37] that's your sister too
[1:43:40] that will be the mother of your children
[1:43:43] that will come
[1:43:48] don't live a dirty little life around
[1:43:50] her
[1:43:51] show that you're a real christian
[1:43:53] gentleman
[1:43:54] live like a christian gentleman ought to
[1:43:57] see
[1:43:58] and treat her like your sister
[1:44:01] and when you get married still treat her
[1:44:04] that way
[1:44:07] and you women
[1:44:09] live the right way to your husband
[1:44:11] and you husbands live the right way to
[1:44:13] your wives be real
[1:44:16] real nice
[1:44:17] and respect one another just with
[1:44:21] and your family relations and so forth
[1:44:23] like that
[1:44:24] let it be just as reverently and godly
[1:44:27] and agreed with among you and everything
[1:44:30] as it can be
[1:44:32] don't never push and shove and be dirty
[1:44:36] and vulgar
[1:44:42] i'd like to invite the musicians to come
[1:44:44] at this time
[1:44:50] now i've hided lighted this part but
[1:44:52] look what he says here
[1:44:54] understand
[1:44:56] talk to your wife
[1:45:00] if one nature is to you and another
[1:45:03] nature to her
[1:45:05] talk it with her
[1:45:07] so now we're right back to the genesis
[1:45:09] account
[1:45:12] you've got one nature men
[1:45:14] and she's got another nature you don't
[1:45:16] have the same you have different natures
[1:45:19] and we've got to try to understand that
[1:45:22] husbands and wives we have to try to
[1:45:25] work that out
[1:45:27] it was real easy for me to say
[1:45:30] surely i'm not going to have a daughter
[1:45:32] what do you do with daughters
[1:45:34] i'm only going to have sons that's the
[1:45:37] only possibility that there is for me
[1:45:40] well god knew better
[1:45:42] and when i got a daughter
[1:45:45] i couldn't treat her
[1:45:46] like a son she was a daughter
[1:45:50] she had a different kind of a nature and
[1:45:53] it was up to me
[1:45:56] to figure that out to understand
[1:45:58] the nature difference
[1:46:02] and we want to be like that
[1:46:06] remember this morning
[1:46:08] the value of the spoken word we want to
[1:46:12] put that into practical purpose in our
[1:46:15] own homes
[1:46:19] talk it with her
[1:46:21] you try to do the same thing to him
[1:46:23] sister
[1:46:24] and the same way
[1:46:26] understand one another
[1:46:29] and be real christian gentlemen and real
[1:46:32] christian ladies and brother and sister
[1:46:35] with one another
[1:46:38] always remember
[1:46:39] you're god's children
[1:46:42] and you're from a royal family
[1:46:45] you're a royal blood
[1:46:47] there's no better blood in the world
[1:46:51] than yours
[1:46:55] that's right
[1:46:56] and a royal blood
[1:46:58] shows itself
[1:47:00] that's what it is
[1:47:02] it's royal
[1:47:04] all believe that say amen
[1:47:07] yes sir
[1:47:08] show what you are i'm a son of a king
[1:47:12] i'm the son of the king
[1:47:15] my wife's a daughter of a king
[1:47:20] how would i treat that king's daughter
[1:47:23] how would she treat that king's son
[1:47:27] see what i mean
[1:47:29] be
[1:47:30] real
[1:47:31] genuine
[1:47:34] that's one more thing
[1:47:36] that i would want
[1:47:38] to be a message for my daughters
[1:47:40] be
[1:47:41] real
[1:47:42] genuine
[1:47:50] a real christian
[1:47:54] genuine
[1:47:57] brother aaron
[1:47:59] said as we were dismissing this
[1:48:00] afternoon did you hear him
[1:48:02] he called you
[1:48:05] sons and daughters of god
[1:48:08] something like that
[1:48:10] that's what he just said
[1:48:14] you
[1:48:15] are a son
[1:48:16] of a king
[1:48:18] you
[1:48:19] are the daughter of a king
[1:48:23] now if you'll notice
[1:48:28] the scripture in zechariah 9 9 says
[1:48:30] rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout
[1:48:33] o daughter of jerusalem behold
[1:48:36] thy king cometh unto thee
[1:48:41] now if you were just a bystander
[1:48:44] just somebody was a part of the kingdom
[1:48:47] and
[1:48:48] the king was coming you'd rejoice
[1:48:51] because that would be your king
[1:48:54] but when that king is your dad
[1:48:58] that's a different feeling altogether
[1:49:01] that's a different relationship
[1:49:02] altogether
[1:49:05] when this says thy king cometh
[1:49:08] that's your dad
[1:49:11] sisters girls
[1:49:13] you're a daughter of a king
[1:49:19] and you want to know why those people
[1:49:21] could rejoice like they were when jesus
[1:49:23] was riding in
[1:49:24] their king their dad
[1:49:27] was coming into jerusalem
[1:49:31] now in the message
[1:49:34] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:49:37] it's the only message that i could find
[1:49:39] where brother branham takes the
[1:49:40] scripture of zechariah 9 9 and he
[1:49:42] expounds on it
[1:49:44] he's the only one i could find now i
[1:49:46] could stand corrected and i'd be happy
[1:49:47] to but it was the only message i could
[1:49:49] find where he expounded on that
[1:49:51] scripture
[1:49:52] and
[1:49:53] and
[1:49:55] just think of the the title of the
[1:49:56] sermon what is the attraction on the
[1:49:59] mountain and it's talking about how that
[1:50:01] jesus was up on the mount of olives and
[1:50:04] how that he was crying out the very same
[1:50:06] words that david cried out joel
[1:50:08] jerusalem jerusalem
[1:50:11] i why why has suffered i would have
[1:50:14] how oft would i have hovered thee as a
[1:50:16] mother in with her brood
[1:50:19] and he's crying out these things
[1:50:26] and this
[1:50:27] scripture through the prophet of
[1:50:30] zechariah
[1:50:31] the prophecy comes forth rejoiced thy
[1:50:34] king cometh to thee he's coming riding
[1:50:37] upon a cult he's coming on a donkey
[1:50:39] riding unto you
[1:50:41] and the people that caught it how they
[1:50:43] begin to rejoice our king
[1:50:46] is come
[1:50:48] this is the great king
[1:50:51] and he was their daddy too
[1:50:53] he was their daddy
[1:50:59] and in this message what is the
[1:51:00] attraction on the mountain brother
[1:51:01] branham is demonstrating what was the
[1:51:03] attraction that these people were
[1:51:05] attracted to it was they were
[1:51:08] recognizing those people that were
[1:51:10] shouting hosanna were recognizing that
[1:51:13] the word of god that which had already
[1:51:16] been spoken was coming to pass at that
[1:51:19] moment
[1:51:22] that this is
[1:51:24] sensational what is happening right now
[1:51:27] scripture that has been spoken hundreds
[1:51:30] of years ago is coming to pass and i'm
[1:51:34] in the picture i'm part of it
[1:51:40] it's so you can imagine then the
[1:51:42] heightened
[1:51:43] reality and the excitement that the
[1:51:45] people that could recognize that were
[1:51:48] feeling at that moment
[1:51:53] brother branham at the end of that
[1:51:56] message and he and he's and he goes down
[1:51:58] through history and he shows you know
[1:52:00] what was the attraction
[1:52:02] uh uh on the mountain with moses well it
[1:52:05] was the people recognizing god
[1:52:08] scumming and speaking to them and being
[1:52:10] a deliverer and calling them out
[1:52:13] and he goes through and he's talking
[1:52:14] about throughout the bible history
[1:52:18] what was the attraction that drew the
[1:52:20] men and women of god it was the word of
[1:52:23] god coming to pass
[1:52:25] and brother branham then at the end he
[1:52:28] says this same prophet who spoke of the
[1:52:32] first coming
[1:52:33] of jesus christ speaks to us
[1:52:37] of the second coming
[1:52:40] and he points us over into zechariah
[1:52:42] chapter
[1:52:43] now brother branham starts at verse 4
[1:52:45] and he reads down to verse 9. i'm going
[1:52:48] to read simply verses the second half of
[1:52:50] 5b to 7 and it's how can we what is the
[1:52:54] attraction that is attracting us
[1:52:57] believers today
[1:52:59] what is the attraction that's attracting
[1:53:02] us
[1:53:02] mother branham as we read this together
[1:53:05] and the lord my god shall come
[1:53:08] and all the saints with thee and it
[1:53:11] shall come to pass in that day that the
[1:53:14] light shall not be clear nor dark but it
[1:53:17] shall be one day which shall be known to
[1:53:19] the lord not day nor night but it shall
[1:53:22] come to pass that at evening time it
[1:53:25] shall be light
[1:53:29] brother branham begins to point out this
[1:53:31] is the evening time
[1:53:34] we're in the last of the gentile church
[1:53:37] ages
[1:53:39] and it is at the time of the last church
[1:53:43] age that the second coming of god will
[1:53:46] come it's at the end of that seventh
[1:53:49] church age
[1:53:50] it shall not be light nor dark it's an
[1:53:53] evening time but it shall be light in
[1:53:56] the evening time
[1:53:58] and we
[1:53:59] as believers when we read that scripture
[1:54:02] and we read those verses and when we
[1:54:04] hear the message of the hour we begin to
[1:54:06] recognize that this is the evening time
[1:54:12] and that the very next thing that we are
[1:54:14] looking for is the second coming of the
[1:54:17] lord
[1:54:22] that's what is attracting us to this
[1:54:24] message
[1:54:25] that's what attracts us to the word of
[1:54:27] god
[1:54:28] is the
[1:54:29] anticipation
[1:54:31] and that that promise
[1:54:34] that has been in the scripture that one
[1:54:36] day
[1:54:37] there's a the lord is coming again to
[1:54:40] get a bride
[1:54:42] [Music]
[1:54:45] the same the same the same
[1:54:48] prophecy and the same prophet who says
[1:54:52] rejoice o daughters
[1:54:55] of zion your king's coming unto you he
[1:54:58] tells us believers at the end time that
[1:55:01] we too can rejoice tonight
[1:55:05] because we're living in the final days
[1:55:09] before the coming of the lord
[1:55:11] and if we can keep the anticipation and
[1:55:15] looking for the coming of the lord one
[1:55:18] of these days will be a part of that
[1:55:27] in the end time evangelism brother
[1:55:29] branham says this and this is my last
[1:55:30] slide now we're going to end right here
[1:55:33] by saying this the end time message
[1:55:37] is to get the bride ready
[1:55:40] and prepared
[1:55:42] for the rapture
[1:55:50] that would be my message
[1:55:53] for my daughters
[1:55:57] that girls
[1:56:00] all these things that that daddy's been
[1:56:02] preaching all these things that daddy
[1:56:04] and mommy have been pointing to and
[1:56:07] and doing our best to live for
[1:56:10] is to point you
[1:56:14] to that event called the rapture
[1:56:18] we want you to be ready for that
[1:56:22] we want you to be ready now it's true
[1:56:26] from the time they're very little
[1:56:28] the girls they love putting on
[1:56:31] these long gowns and playing wedding
[1:56:35] like this is the day of the wedding and
[1:56:38] who's gonna be and they have to grab
[1:56:40] cousins and whoever else to be the
[1:56:41] bridegroom
[1:56:43] and they're going to play with whoever
[1:56:44] they can get the cat or whoever is going
[1:56:46] to be the groom but they're going to do
[1:56:48] a wedding
[1:56:52] and it's something that you look forward
[1:56:54] to as a father that oh one day you know
[1:56:58] my daughter and you know walking down
[1:57:00] that aisle and
[1:57:01] you know my daughter happy my daughter
[1:57:04] living happy with that
[1:57:06] but ultimately as believers it is
[1:57:10] only a small fraction
[1:57:14] of what we're desiring and that is
[1:57:18] that marriage supper
[1:57:22] where there is that union with the real
[1:57:24] bride of the real bridegroom
[1:57:28] jesus christ
[1:57:31] that's what we're living for that's what
[1:57:33] i want from my daughters
[1:57:34] i believe that this message
[1:57:38] this message the message of the hour
[1:57:42] is a message for daughters of god
[1:57:45] [Music]
[1:57:47] and i i'm happy to be represented in
[1:57:49] that
[1:57:52] as a man i can tell you
[1:57:55] that i'm happy when i read
[1:57:57] about these
[1:57:58] these women
[1:57:59] in the bible
[1:58:01] who are
[1:58:02] willing to make clean-cut decisions who
[1:58:05] are willing to
[1:58:07] to be like esther and do only that which
[1:58:09] would please the king
[1:58:13] it's just
[1:58:14] when i read those things it's my heart
[1:58:17] that cries out as a man oh god let me be
[1:58:21] that
[1:58:23] let me be that
[1:58:27] i i i love the stories of the ox goat
[1:58:30] and
[1:58:32] and the acts of faith
[1:58:35] you know overcoming the enemy and wiping
[1:58:37] out the enemy
[1:58:48] but i don't want
[1:58:49] i don't want great exploits done in my
[1:58:52] life
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:54] if all it does is
[1:58:56] point to me
[1:58:59] i want whatever i'm doing whatever
[1:59:02] happens in my life if if there's any
[1:59:04] testimony to be given if there's any
[1:59:07] glory to be given let that glory be to
[1:59:10] jesus christ
[1:59:14] and it's these daughters that give such
[1:59:16] a clear representation of that when we
[1:59:18] read our bibles
[1:59:22] church i would tell you this is a
[1:59:23] message for daughters
[1:59:26] whether that's the daughters of
[1:59:27] jerusalem or the daughters of zion you
[1:59:30] rightly divide the word of god for
[1:59:32] yourself and you find yourself in the
[1:59:35] word of god
[1:59:37] when you when you see
[1:59:39] that that is a representation of
[1:59:42] everything that is within you that is
[1:59:43] crying out you hold on to that
[1:59:48] believe god for it
[1:59:55] let us stand together
[1:59:57] [Music]
[2:00:02] as we bow our heads
[2:00:05] in prayer
[2:00:14] now is that opportunity
[2:00:16] when we can see
[2:00:20] the heart purpose of god
[2:00:25] his very existence is to have a bride of
[2:00:27] his own choosing
[2:00:29] that
[2:00:31] that the whole purpose of this message
[2:00:35] was you
[2:00:38] a relationship with you
[2:00:41] that you were in him in the beginning
[2:00:43] and that when god
[2:00:45] pulled you from his bosom
[2:00:48] [Music]
[2:00:51] you were always a part of him
[2:00:53] and it was not good that he would be
[2:00:55] alone
[2:00:58] and
[2:01:02] though the voice that we want to hear
[2:01:06] the only voice we want to hear is the
[2:01:07] voice of our beloved
[2:01:10] jesus christ speaking to us i want to
[2:01:12] let you know that his desire is to hear
[2:01:15] your voice
[2:01:17] is to hear you
[2:01:18] to have a relationship
[2:01:21] to hear you talk back to him
[2:01:24] when he demonstrates his love for us
[2:01:27] i think it would only be right for us to
[2:01:29] express back to him we love you lord
[2:01:34] thank you lord
[2:01:36] we worship you lord
[2:01:38] we give you praise god
[2:01:41] lord we surrender again
[2:01:44] god take all of me
[2:01:47] oh daddy abba father
[2:01:51] he wants us to he wants to hear us
[2:01:54] it's not a
[2:01:55] this was not a bible written
[2:01:57] as a monologue but this was a dialogue
[2:02:01] this was a
[2:02:02] message for the daughters of zion to
[2:02:05] rejoice
[2:02:07] to go ahead and proclaim
[2:02:10] with your lips go ahead and use the
[2:02:12] spoken word
[2:02:14] to praise jesus christ to give him glory
[2:02:18] to give him honor to give him the
[2:02:20] preeminence
[2:02:22] and i believe that if we can begin to
[2:02:24] express by spoken word
[2:02:27] the thanksgiving with our lips the
[2:02:29] sacrifice of thanksgiving i believe it
[2:02:32] would go before god as the sacrifice and
[2:02:35] the offering that abel offered there
[2:02:39] at the east
[2:02:40] part of eden
[2:02:43] so i would encourage you and i would
[2:02:44] invite you as we pray tonight that you
[2:02:47] would use the spoken word
[2:02:50] to give him the praise he deserves
[2:02:53] heavenly father
[2:02:55] lord thank you for this message
[2:02:58] lord thank you that you've called sons
[2:03:01] and daughters
[2:03:02] lord we thank you that you not only sent
[2:03:05] your spirit to be with us and to speak
[2:03:07] to us but you said that you would be in
[2:03:10] us
[2:03:11] that god you would walk within us and
[2:03:13] that god you would be god within us and
[2:03:16] that we could be called sons and
[2:03:17] daughters and that you would call us

[2:03:23] these women sitting here in this place

[2:03:57] for me i believe lord jesus if we could

[2:04:03] and new to this that lord when they
[2:04:06] examine the word of god and they see
[2:04:08] that it's the truth and they would open
[2:04:10] their heart and say i desire to be
[2:04:13] called a son of god i desire to be
[2:04:16] called a daughter of god lord i pray
[2:04:19] that you would not disappoint but that

[2:04:25] grant them over and abundantly what they
[2:04:27] could ask or think

[2:04:33] know the baptism of the holy ghost that
[2:04:37] god tonight they could experience that
[2:04:39] baptism and they could know what it is
[2:04:43] to have that separation
[2:04:45] and to know what it is to live in
[2:04:47] holiness that they could live a life

[2:15:31] you know
[2:15:32] it's kind of funny coming back from
[2:15:35] eating today
[2:15:37] brother reggie and the family and
[2:15:40] i treated him so well
[2:15:43] he had ordered a salad
[2:15:46] at the place there and
[2:15:48] didn't really pay attention
[2:15:50] and then
[2:15:53] he was waiting for his salad but i
[2:15:54] thought he wanted a salad plate so i
[2:15:56] said get the salad plate
[2:15:58] and he filled himself up with a salad
[2:16:01] and about halfway through the salad they
[2:16:02] delivered his plate full of salad
[2:16:07] but you did all right didn't you
[2:16:10] you know
[2:16:12] a god that cares for us
[2:16:16] he really does and as of course he's
[2:16:18] talking about girls and
[2:16:20] i don't know nothing about that
[2:16:23] um
[2:16:25] but i do remember the day naomi was born
[2:16:27] and i held her in my arms for the first
[2:16:29] time
[2:16:30] i had to be the proudest daddy there was
[2:16:33] there's just there just was nothing
[2:16:35] better
[2:16:38] we never had a boy's name
[2:16:41] that we agreed on
[2:16:43] i wanted benjamin aaron she wanted aaron
[2:16:45] joseph
[2:16:47] never happened
[2:16:49] but we had girls names
[2:16:52] you know but
[2:16:53] i hope you to mine for a couple moments
[2:16:55] here
[2:16:56] mama would say
[2:16:58] go ask your daddy why not
[2:17:02] when they would have a question
[2:17:05] especially as they got into their
[2:17:06] teenage years
[2:17:09] and they would say daddy mom said to ask
[2:17:11] you why this and this
[2:17:14] and my answer was because you didn't
[2:17:15] know your daddy when he was teenaged
[2:17:19] you got to know your daddy later
[2:17:22] we all go through
[2:17:23] this life of growing up
[2:17:26] but the grace of god never leaves his
[2:17:28] children
[2:17:30] but i told my wife coming this way
[2:17:33] i don't know what brought up the subject
[2:17:35] but i said how can these
[2:17:37] this royal family speak speaking
[2:17:40] especially of
[2:17:41] of england and all that's going on with
[2:17:43] possibility of the queen passing away
[2:17:46] and i thought who would want to live
[2:17:48] under all that
[2:17:51] and when he was preaching the answer
[2:17:53] came if you're of royal bloodline
[2:17:56] that's who you are
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:00] how many are part of that royal
[2:18:03] bloodline
[2:18:04] whose father is god therefore you would
[2:18:07] desire to live
[2:18:09] the life
[2:18:10] of the family of god

[2:18:44] become him my grace
[2:18:52] he

[2:20:45] a pie
[2:20:46] and she said i'm going to take this over
