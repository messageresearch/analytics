brings a ray of light when i get a touch lord from you oh just another touch though from in our trials [Music] oh just another touch [Music] i go through the dark maybe [Music] when i get a touchdown [Music] trust that's your daily desire and hope lord just today tonight wherever just to know you're near me to to know that you're mindful of me so that's what we live for we have some requests to bring to your attention for those of you who have been here for a while you might remember brother jacob and alma lopez had attended church here for some time jacob called brother arne and asked us to remember his twelve-year-old grandson named nehemiah with serious heart conditions they had a hospital here in tucson but then they took him to a hospital in san diego for for a serious heart situation so little nehemiah will remember that and then sister amelia asked us to remember her in prayer she's not been feeling well so we'll do that and then [Music] my wife texts i believe with sister connie and sister connie had request prayer for her and brother kevin and they both tested positive for for coping so we'll remember them in prayer [Music] um brother robert figueroa spoke with him yesterday and they both brother robert and sister dalia were positive and brothers robert said he had gone up to 104 degrees the other day in temperature but he sent out a request to the church to remember him in prayer right then and he said within 10 minutes the folks were responding were praying and the temperature came back down to about a hundred so god answers prayer but in the in the process and speaking with him and also his son bobby called me and somebody in each part of the family has had tested positive for kobit uh including sister jessica when she went back home to pennsylvania one of her daughters one of brother jude's son's brother robert bobby jr told me that pretty well all of his family was not feeling well and so we would they were requesting prayer but also knowing that god answers prayer it's it's not without just a hope and i hope so but there's an assurance that he's the same yesterday today and forever but seeing this body in the flesh we have troubles we have things but he's a god that delivereth from all all of it and that's why our desire is for that other party to to get past that so also to remember brother merle and sister roberta baggett as they prepare to to go spend time with their daughter priscilla and brother joe and the family and everything goes well they'll believe in sunday to newfoundland and he kind of explained all that they were going to have to go through this week to prepare and to be able to go so we'll remember that that would all work out for them to be able to go today this weekend and be able to spend some time i believe sister priscilla is due to have a child a baby here real soon so that would be really good to have mama with her so we wanted to remember that and because of of those testing positive to covid they had the progressive dinner for the young people and from a couple of churches in our church and so we know there has been some exposure to it so there was a question is how we we should handle this and we just failed to just say this way if you know you're suffering with some type of symptom you are sick take care of yourself stay home just just be safe if you have a concern you're nervous you're worried about it then if you feel safe for the statement it's okay nobody's going to hold it against you and i know there are some folks that aren't quarantined right now because they know they've been exposed but we will have sunday morning service and you just be cautious i was listening to brother donald reagan the other day as he was addressing his congregation and he said just don't let the fear take control that that's what you don't want to be afraid of it he said because he's a god that healeth he healeth all our diseases he said but also be cautious take care of yourself so i just good advice i believe so if you have a need if we'll stand together you have a need and i know we raise our hands quite often but every day i know there's something we have need of just um talking to different folks and everybody has desires and needs in their lives so and we know that he supplies every need he has met it so talking with brother peter just a little bit before we came in and realized what a great god we serve almighty god we serve just just been reading things different different things that that the scripture tells us some of the things that brother branham said even different ministers what a mighty god we serve but we also live in flesh and that flesh is subject to that which is around but he delivereth from also i believe you lord and i trust in you lord we we raise our hand because we do have a need but then we raise another hand because we know that every need is supplied lord and in a day in a time lord when there's so much happening on this earth and it's just signs of the time lord showing that you're coming you're you're coming to take your bride home is so close today lord and help us to have that confidence that faith the lord that we shall be changed lord but you would you were wounded for our transgressions you were bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was laid upon you and by your strife we are healed lord will will confess your word will believe your word lord comfort and strengthen and encourage lord those lord that maybe today are suffering with the discouragement suffering with with hurt lord and maybe their their hearts are broken today lord would you come and encourage them and strengthen them and lift them up lord remind them that that you're mindful of them that that you still care for them i pray lord for your honor and glory in jesus christ's name amen [Music] we also have my brother scott hanley for those of you been a while back they were the brothers that came from georgia were doing the plumbing work and i looking at them from behind i said that's got to be him but it was confirmed it is god bless you brother scott good to see you taking a little vacation time they did some work for us here in the church and they were doing some work here in town so good to see you here with us so this evening we're going to hear a tape the message called why preaching 62 in south gate california a little over an hour but brother branham speaks about the bomb of gilead and he's still the same yesterday today and forever we cast all our cares upon him because he cares for us so we'll do that and if we'll we'll sing that only but only belief all things are possible there's nothing that's impossible talking with brother peter we we we get to thinking of this great god this marvelous god and we know the things out of the scripture the testimonies the very testimonies in your own life that god has done for you and then tomorrow we have problems again and then you wait but that faith that assurance that he is with you he never leaves you he watches over you and every need is supplied so all [Music] all things are possible [Music] oh [Music] all things are possible lonely now confess with me lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i may be god bless you may be seated our heavenly father as we approach the throne of grace tonight the blessed assurance that he has given us that we would be heard and our prayers would be attended to we would ask first the forgiveness of our sins and the sins of the people and we had asked again that your blessings will continue to be made known among us that your name might be honored bless the words that said in both song and sermon testimony or whatever might be done heal the sick save the lost give the holy spirit to those who are hungered and thirsty may this be a night long remembered because of thy presence we asked it in jesus name amen i was saying the other morning at the breakfast i'm always just a little bit late and i was preaching at a united brethren church not long ago and i was coming in about an hour late and so the minister said i will now introduce the late mr ram i said well i've always been a little late my mother said i was a full nine months baby it didn't look like i didn't have enough time i only weighed five pounds when i was married i she waited for me for about an hour i held the whole thing up and made a hospital call and come back if i can just be late for my funeral now that's the next thing if i just put that off i don't want that to come too quick so i want to stay and serve the lord it's good to be here and to have this fine audience of people out again tonight i think in the morning to you that live up around los angeles there is a christian businessman's breakfast in the morning i believe he's still holding at the clifton's cafeteria and i hope to be there in the morning i have learned that brother secarin has been pretty ill he's going to be there well that's fine brother demas shakarian a personal brother good friend of mine i'm sorry to hear about it i heard he got a little sick but didn't know he was as sick as what he was just got run down i told him about two years ago you better pull in just a little bit look back said practice what you preach and so uh i remember the last time here when raymond richie caught me by the trouser leg as he was coming into the church down here in los angeles that noah beg your pardon and long beach was going into the auditorium there that night raymond's a personal friend of mine he had a breakdown he's in a terrible condition he said brother branham don't go too long he just come back from korea raymond get a little far up the road too you know he said you'll kill yourself and said then look what a condition i'm in now and uh i've been along those lines so i know what it is i see so much to be done yet it looks like you haven't got time to do it it makes you nervous so i just hope the lord forgives me that my zeal will not overcome my wisdom you give me wisdom to know how to handle my zeal or other it's nice to be here tonight with you brethren so nice this nice audience here i'm just so glad to see the these meetings look like everybody just in one heart one a card looks like anything could happen the last few meetings has been that way and i'm just so thankful to the lord as long as they continue like that i feel like i can just keep moving on a while it's when you hit those crossfires that's when it's bad you know and and the no unity and but here it's just been just one great big brotherhood everything just so thankful for them may the lord continue now we realize that we haven't got the tinsel on the meetings that we did at the first time uh usually a revival breaks out unless according to history about three years a minister usually gives his best in three years after that he lives on his reputation of what he made in those three years i'm so glad i placed mine upon the word that's right so i can live by the word i just believe this blessed whole bible i just think it's the grandest thing and i think it is it is god the word is god in letter form and when the holy spirit lines up on it it just brings it to life i was talking to someone we have private interviews and that's where you have to we about way at home i think there's 300 on the list when we left waiting for those private interviews we go in with the people just pull the curtains down and we stay there until we pray until the lord reveals by a vision what to do now we know the word of the lord tells us and lays out the program but this sometimes is there's things in a person's life that they don't know just what to do and there's where we stay before the lord until it's answered and then we hit these interviews like we come over here the people in this district maybe has been waiting some of them for four or five years for these interviews and we were speaking i believe it was yesterday or this morning one that about the light shining in the last days now i have refrained from preaching because i'm just here to pray for the sick and to put my neck with my brethren and pull but i truly believe that we're living in the last days it's right at the end time i'd like to take a a group like this a unity of spirit and heart and i wish we had about about two or three weeks that we could just start through having afternoon services and morning services and evening services and just bringing the bible as we see it and uh been so thankful he's a greek scholar studying behind me and is with him the other day the man is from greece his father is a noted minister in greece and he takes my tapes and he said brother branham i thought you were a greek scholar i said i don't even know good english let alone one word agree he said but bringing your nouns pronouns and everything in your teaching on your tapes says i can put a line like this and it divides it perfectly and hits right in with the greek and i said well i'm thankful for that because i always try to feel led of the holy spirit to say what i say and uh if it said anything contrary to the bible then i wouldn't believe it see i wouldn't believe that it was uh the holy spirit because it will always stay in the bible the holy spirit will and we were talking about this little woman that us this afternoon this morning i believe it was that we were talking about the little woman that i spoke of the ill-famed little fella that came out to the well at sachar and she seen the lord jesus and not recognizing yet she was to be one of his disciples i have a little funny doctrine and if it don't go just right with yours you do the same way i do when i'm eating fried chicken at your house i just love fried chicken and when i hit a bone i don't quit eating chicken i just throw the bone away and keep eating chicken so you believe the same thing now i believe that the church's name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world when before the lamb was slain because the bible said the antichrist would deceive all upon the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life slain before the foundation of the world i believe the infinite god by his foreknowledge saw the church now i know it's a ticklish subject and remember there's a truth to it i don't believe it in the line of many does but i believe that there is by for knowledge god could tell the end from the beginning because he's the infinite god now whether i'm part of that church i hope i am i'm just seeking out my own salvation with fear and trembling staying right in the word but if i get out of there then i'll pray to get back in it again and so when that it's not a good word to use see but by that predestinated seed laying in that little woman believing watching yet in her sinful condition she was watching for a coming of a messiah the church order in that day was so almost like it is the day she she just soon lived like she was living and of course she's seen the ridiculous of how the people have professed to be religious and was nothing but a lord of hypocrisy and i say that not to be sacrilegious i say that with honesty and sincere in my heart love for everybody and then when that when she was standing there waiting to see what the answer that man was when she said it's not customary she was getting in the tradition then of the elders for you jews to ask samaritan me a woman of samara such a thing or have any dealings he said but if you knew who you were speaking to you would ask me for water then the question come up and jesus said go get your husband she said i have none he said well you have said because you have had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband quickly watch there was that predestinated seed eternal life all the father has given me will come no man can come unless he calls see all the father hath past tense given me will come and when that light flashed across that predestinated seed quickly not like them educated scholars standing over there criticizing they thought they were in that group but they wasn't they called him beelzebub but as soon as he hit that predestinated seat that light flashed across and she said sir we know messiah when he comes he'll do this kind of a work he said i'm he that speaks with you oh my god that's what all the father has given me we only sow seeds god lodges them wherever he will some falls for the wayside some comes up in thorns for a few days and this will choke them out and so forth and others go into the right place i don't know where they are we just stole them thank you god bless you now let us read the word now i want to take if it be all right the opportunity tonight to kindly teach just a little nothing out of the ordinary just little teaching and maybe sunday afternoon the lord willing i would like to teach a little message to the church if the lord permits so nice of these brethren here that told me brother branham if the nice letter all of them sign it we turn you into the pulpit preach what's on your heart uh that's i couldn't have no more liberty than that and so i i'm very grateful for a group of men mostly ministers are suspicious because they have a right to be they are shepherds and they want to know what their flocks are eating that's right they should know and a man that's got dignity and honor wouldn't do nothing to hurt anyone or any flock he would always try to give it some vitamins if anything cut into the into the flock so maybe the lord will give us some vitamins on the same words that we've heard many times let us turn tonight to the second book of the kings and readjust the potion of the scripture then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab and ahaza fell down through the lattice in the upper chamber that was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go of beelzebub the god of acorn whether i shall recover of this disease but the angel of the lord said unto elijah the tishbite rise and go meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a god in israel that you go to inquire of the elders above the god of icara now wherefore thus saith the lord thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou has gone up but shall surely die and elijah departed and when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto them why are you now turned back and they said unto him there came a man up to meet us and said unto this goal turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it not because there is not a god in israel that thou sent us to inquire of the elves above the god of aeochon therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shall surely die and he said unto them what matter of man was he which came to meet thee and told thee these words and they answered him he was a hairy man girded with a girdle of leather about his loins and he said it is elijah the tishbite now in jeremiah for a text if i should call it in jeremiah the 8th chapter and the 22nd verse is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered and i would like to take the subject if it should be called such the text rather as the little word of why wh wow i hope i'm not too loud back there if the engineer of this will kind of govern it they got a little yolk around my neck tonight here so uh i hope i don't get too loud and it's good for my rough voice when god makes a way of escape for the people and the people refuse that escape then god asks the question why i think he has a right to if god does all that he can for the people and the people refuse to receive his help then he has a right to ask why they didn't do it i believe it'll be that way at the judgment when god has made every preparation that could be made for the church and for the people and then they refuse it god's going to ask us why we didn't receive it i believe that now we find out that this ehaza was the son of ahab and jesse bell they had come out of a cursed family and when you take a family that's raising their children in the wrong atmosphere you can hardly expect anything else israel was a nation something like this nation it made its same mistakes that this nations made and we find out that israel come up out of egypt and drove the occupants out of the land and possess the land the same that we come seeking an oase and drove the native shearer back and possessed the land israel had favor before god we believe that our pilgrim fathers did also israel in his early stages produced some great man uh well they had for instance david solomon joshua great man and we had a washington lincoln and a great man but finally israel in its politics formed around and got a renegade on the throne ahab a halfway believer lukewarm church member and ahab wasn't such a a rascal as it was his wife all right she was one that could just handle ahab any way she wanted to make him go she did it and you don't have to be too spiritual to understand what i'm talking about it's the system behind it but in that day they had a prophet and his name was elijah and he was a fearless godly man and i think a lot of you do good democrats that soldier of birthrights of politics to do such an evil thing as you've done stop being merciful one day this nation knowed that old thing but she's forgotten she sold out because the church got lukewarm got away from god that's exactly i better leave off of that because i said i wasn't going to preach them now as we go on but you know what i'm thinking notice but in that same day god sent a mighty one in the land just before that there come a plague that swept the land out and god was proven now doing this after ahab's death his sun tucky's place and um ezekie and he reigned in samaria and one day walking out in the lattices he fell through and some disease set into the a place where he got hurt and now instead of following like the forefathers did to consult god about it he sent to the idol beelzebub it's a strange thing that a man that's supposed to be an israelite would consult such as that instead of going back to the very god that brought him over into that land and give it to them because he was trying to follow the trend of the day and after his father and mother that's what's happened in the churches today too much we have got away from the spiritual application of the principles that this nation stands for and has got up on politics and union and big time and belly full and a new car and new homes and and got away from the real principles of things the real principles of christianity it's too bad we have to say these things but somebody's got to say it and it's got to come to pass we must be frank and honest and sincere and you do not need spiritual interpretation because it's before your eyes you can see it but we have as they did in those days sold our birthrights for a mess of pottage and we are going to reap just what we sowed and it's done past now and the revival that we had sweeping across the country it's died down to a little smoldering uh flame here and there or something we don't want to believe it but it's the truth that's right and uh we went out and sold a bunch of great denominational seeds and when the spirit fell what did we reap a denominational crop if we sold the word of god we'd reap the church of god if we would have done it but we got off on the wrong side the rain comes up on the earth to water it and if whatever what kind of seed is in the field that's what it brings forth that's right and so the same holy spirit that brings forth uh the church of the living god brings forth the weeds also the denominationals but you see what we've agreed million more and 44 for baptism so forth and on down and that's what we've reaped just exactly as we sowed it's always going to be that way and israel was just reap what she had sowed and this a young fellow had come in now to take over and instead of sending down and seeking god to the people that had come there to this great uh economy that god had given in he sent over to uh the popular idol of the day the beelzebub the popular religion among the people just a few were holding a torchlight and elijah was the great prophet of that day and he forgot about elijah he didn't care about elijah because elijah would have told him where he was standing therefore they don't want to know what's the truth they'd rather take this other way not realizing that you're going to reap what you sow amen exactly that's the law of nature you do it it's the law of the spirit you certainly have to do it now but you know god reveals his secrets to his prophets the bible said over amos surely god will do nothing except he reveals to his prophets and then when this messenger is on the road over to meet the priest and to find out from beelzebub the condition of their king and what would be the outcome they didn't want to take god's way to line up with god's word to line up with god's way of doing things they wanted to live any way they wanted to and still be religious that's what the this nation has come to today it just don't want to line up with god it wants to live any way it wants to but it wants to be religious so it'll take the easiest way out it always finds that water seeps its level always now they had another arm to lean on they didn't need jehovah anymore they didn't want that strict way they wanted to live after their own lust in their own fashions and yet they could be religious but remember wade down there in that cave pulled back an old hairy looking man with look like a fuzzy worm back in there but under that little brown skin and skinny arms beat the heart that god lived in he said elijah arise and go up there and meet him oh my what we needed is another elijah not afraid to tell the truth went up there and stood in the way piece of sheepskin there were leather around his launch chair to gird him up and there he stood the fuzz all over his face and and i suppose he didn't take a bath every night and use his forks and knives the way we do here in hollywood and shine up the way we do but yet god was with him god was in him we put so much stress on the traditions of the day now we notice now he stood in the way when these messengers come up and he said is it because gold telling is it because there is not a god in israel is there no prophet here is that the reason oh there was a god and there was a prophet but it was a king's own stubbornness he didn't want to line up with god in his prophet and that was the reason that the king was seeking the easiest way out of these things he said is it because there is no prophet there is no god in israel there's no other there's no way of finding it i wonder today if it is the day that we seek comfort we have just lost left some holidays people go out and get drunk on those holidays their sunday school teachers church members choir members go out and drink and crowds and gambling and the people live just the way they want to and yet they belong to the highest churches there is in the city some of the highest order of this intellectual ecclesiastical system that's dominating this country that there is and wonder why why don't they come they're looking for pleasure they're looking for peace they're substituting the devil is substituting such rowdiest things as that to take the place of a real good spirit-filled experience where the joy of the lord can come upon them and give them peace and rest they love the pleasures of the world more than they love the kingdom of god their life proves it that's right it's exactly what they live shows it there's no difference in them seems to be who is a believer and who's not talked to him that tells us it's dirty of jokes and they have their societies and so forth and carry on just like the rest of the world i lived across the street from a great parish of a great order of christian people as they call themselves and every saturday night in the floor of the mints why you never heard such carrying on and twisting rock and rolls and bloodly wiggly and all that ungodly stuff and carry on and then on sunday morning go to the church with a past look on their face brother when the holy spirit comes into your life it changes that life [Applause] amen and the sad part is creeping into our pentecostal organizations it's getting into there because just as it's always been when israel saw the other nations had a king and they wanted to act like the other nations the old prophet came to him samuel and he said you must you're a different people you mustn't be like them god is your king he said have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what come to pass have i ever begged you for your money or taken your finances and so forth to build great honorable monuments and everything else they had to say that he didn't he said then listen to me and he had the word of the lord but the people had to admit that everything that he had said had been the word of the lord and it had come to pass just as he said it would come to pass but yet the people wanted to look like the rest of the people that's the way it is today that the churches are trying to pattern after the other churches christ is our pattern [Applause] so exactly that now they didn't want it they didn't want the message what if that king would have humbled himself what if he had come down to the you you've been humiliated and it went back to god and repented i believe the man were to live i believe elijah would have come to him with the word of the lord and the man would have lived but he hardened his heart and would not listen to the lord and elijah said go ask him is it because there's no no god in israel he has no prophet no he had a prophet he had there was a god but the king didn't want it that's what it is today it's just like a a patient sitting on a doctor's doorstep and die sitting on the doorstep because he's too stubborn to go in to take the medicine the doctor's got for him exactly die on the step of the doctor sitting out there and the doctor says i've got the remedy for your ailment but it's just too stubborn to go in and take it that's a dangerous thing amen a fellow could die and he would die sitting there when there's plenty of medicine they got a toxin for it but they he won't take it he's just too stubborn well then you can't let on to the doctor you can't let on to the medicine it's the man he's the one so is it today men and women will set in the church hallelujah in the church and hear the unadulterated gospel in the power of the holy ghost and see the manifestations and the demonstrations of the spirit of a living resurrected christ and dying sin setting in the church view not because there's no bomb not because there's no physician but it's because the people are too stubborn to take the medicine trying to find the least way of resistance going the way of the world perishing in the game city of korra you know what korra done it's always the leaders that gets the people mixed up and that they perish in the game saying of korra sure don't blame the doctor don't blame the medicine it's you to blame if the doctor's got the remedy and he's got plenty of it he invites you to come and you won't come then it's not the doctor's fault neither is it the medicine's fault it's your fault because you won't take the medicine that's right and people said in the churches dying the few without knowing god without receiving the holy ghost because they think they'll have to give up some of the things of the world they'd rather belong to a church that's got a higher name or what they think a little more prestige do you ever realize that god's way is a few goes that way and they're despised and rejected because they're not of the world they are of god a peculiar people a royal priesthood amen offering spiritual sacrifices that is the fruits of the lips giving praise unto god amen doctors medicines you know they used to have a time they didn't have any toxin for such as smallpox thousands died yearly with smallpox they didn't have a diphtheria toxin and thousands died every year with toxin without having any toxin they died with diphtheria but now they got toxin they got inoculation for those things and how does a doctor ever get a hold of these medicines anyhow how do they how do they ever do it you know what they do they put a lot of stuff together some poison and then some antidote mix it together so they mix up a formula and then they get a get a guinea pig and they inject this medicine into the guinea pig if he survives it then they give it to you and then and if it uh says to kill the disease that's in your body so much of poison so much to upset that poison too much poison would kill you too much antidote wouldn't do any good the medicine wouldn't it's got to be a balanced formula and some medicines from the doctor he can give it for instance like penicillin one of the great discoveries that they think it's a discovery when i was in south africa i seen a native there and when he would they get a sore on their leg or something other the sword gets old they find an old orange laying another tree somewhere that's molded and they rub that orange in there been doing it for hundreds and hundreds of years and they get well what is it penicillin sure so they think they're smart they're hot and cotton africa know that thousand years ago god done told him not take care of himself then we think that it's something smart that we got now penicillin sometimes an over shot will kill a patient and some of them it helps it there's a question there they claim that nowadays course number one killer they say is heart trouble no odd different from that number one killer isn't heart trouble number one killer is sin trouble that's the killer that's the thing it's sin that's a killer not heart trouble so many people say i just got to sin i just have to smoke women say i just got to cut my hair i i can't get any other clothes i just have to wear what they got you know what's the matter they're making excuses they haven't tried god's toxins they'll be inoculated from such stuff glory yes it's because that they haven't tried god's toxins they refuse to take it for when the spirit of god is in you it lines up with the word of god if it denies the word of god then it isn't you haven't got the right shot yet that's all you're not inoculated sin still lays at the door unbelief in the word so it takes the toxin of god to kill sin and sin is number one killer yes it is it kills and it kills to the uttermost so we know that it's a that it's a sin that does a killing so it's a toxin the people just refuse to take it they don't like it they don't like the thought of new birth now we know that any birth is a mess i don't care if it's in a pig pen or if it's in a pink decorated hospital room any birth is a mess and the new birth is nothing less it's a mess it right it'll make you boo-hoo and cry and carry on like you and then the office masters every end but it'll do you good amen jesus said except the corner wheat falls on the ground and dies it abides alone and the people don't want to die you want to be alive in the world and still you want to be religious so you accept an intellectual conception of it and then when you do that you're still dead in sin and trespasses that's what makes people act and do the way they do because the spirit that's in them dominates your life say well other people do this well you're not like the other people you are dead and your life is hidden god through christ and healed by the holy spirit hallelujah all right see you didn't try the toxin it's just because the people don't want to try now you've got to die you've got to rot that's the trouble of people still growing out the altar and get some kind of sensation jump up and shake hands with the preacher go out and get some kind of a dogma or creed and recite it and say i belong to so-and-so i belong to so and so are you a christian i'm so and so a christian is to be christ-like christ like us to believe the word if you don't believe the word then he can't be christ-like how can you say you're a christian and deny half of the word if the holy spirit wrote the word the holy spirit confirms the word and the holy spirit is the word the word is abiding in you brings god's promises to every believer amen the word means so be it i believe it with all my heart it's the word of the living god amen notice yes the new birth they don't want to die now they substituted something for a new birth if the devil if you won't take god's word then the devil will give you his word and that's where the first human race where the human race first fell was to disbelieve god's word the best way that god could ever fortify his army was to fortify them with the best of our nation we got spies in england england's got spies here yet we're friendly we got spies all over the world the world's got spies in here they're watching see what kind of a new missile what kind of a new thing then they'll go back to their nation find something to counteract that why they're dressed their man get things ready for that kind of a war it's always going on there's a warfare between the devil and god always has been and every year they're finding something new the old airplanes they use back there the old p-38s and whatever there was they scrapped them they got jets now the old spring feels no good at all they got a missile rifle now the old blockbuster is so far behind while even the old trains the old steam engine used to pull the stuff up and down the tracks obsolete sure they got something new they're always searching something new something new now they're trying to dig down in the ground find some way to escape the atomic bomb something new something new god gave the very best at the beginning for his great mighty army and he's never had to change it because as i said last night his first decision is the best and only he gave his people his word and satan reasoned with him reasons against the word of god that's what the devil does today he tries to reason it said now this is only reasons that you don't have to do this it's only reasons we got good doctors who don't need divine healing it's only reason we got plenty members we don't need uh we don't need the holy ghost the holy ghost they're reasoning now god to say the people are mentally upset they're emotional because themselves they are dead in sin and trespasses and knows nothing about the power of god amen reminds me amen an infidel one time was holding the bait and and he said there is no such a thing as got a little country boy with a overhaul jacket on his hair hanging down his face walked up began to pee on an apple the infidel said sap what are you on he said i want to ask you a question he said well what is it he cored the apple and took a bite and again he said is that apple sour or sweet and infidel said i don't know because i'm not eating he said that's just what i was saying said and the people left the infidel out of the platform why because he had never tasted he had never tried he never took the top scene hallelujah all the power of god to inoculate you from any unbelief of god's word a real holy spirit will punctuate every sentence within a man they won't say the days of miracles is passing no such as this and no such as that well only reason said we shouldn't do it this way we shouldn't do it that way what god says the holy spirit said amen amen every sentence every word every verse in the bible is punctuated with an amen yes sir the new birth brings a mess but it brings new life with it that's right a plant anything a seed has to rock to bring the new life out of it a sinner has to die and rock to his own ideas his own life has to rot that the new life can grow out of it it's a mess but it's a glorious mess it brings new life that's what the church sees today but they're bypassing with dogmas and so forth to try to escape the thoughts of dying to themselves they want to live to themselves he that lives to himself lives for himself and the devil he that denies himself shall find his life in christ and he'll be a new creature now we find out how they find these toxins they take them as i was saying and they mix up a farm or the science there and give it to a guinea pig now everybody's not nature like a guinea pig so it'll kill some help the others we know that but you know when there was a time that god didn't have too good or toxins his toxin was by sheep and goats but one time god was going to perfect his toxin so he never tried to give it to a guinea pig he gave it to himself he took the toxin himself that's why the christ the anointed god was made flesh in order to take the toxin into his own body any good doctor will try the toxin on himself and nobody else will do it and there was nobody else that could do it but god so he came down jehovah and was made flesh and dwelt among us and took the toxin himself [Music] [Applause] on the jordan when he was standing there john full record said i'll see the spirit of god like a dove the sin of your father and he received the toxin and the inoculation from sin and death he's born of a woman and received a toxin and they watched him to see what would happen and they noticed him in his trial they noticed him when he come in the face of dispute he always helped to the father's word but uh you know surely uh god wouldn't do a thing like that he reasoned it with eve but when he come against christ he hit against that hundred thousand vote why the feathers flew when he come with his reasoning because he met him right back with just said the lord said if you're the son of god and you're hungry why don't you turn these stones to bread and eat reasoning you could do it sure he could but he come back it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word preceded thou the mouth of god they watched him they seen the toxin help in every case when it come time faced with death the toxin helped when they spit his face made fun of him the toxin help trust where you got toxin or not that's your test somebody say something about you and say you're old holy roller will you quit going to church then say you're inoculated say you've received the toxin the bomb is there no bomb in gilead is there no exposition there if there is then why is a daughter remember not the mother he divorced her but the daughters this church that prophecy pertains to this why is the daughter of my people her health not recovered then here she is anemic tonight that's right half this way in half that way it all scrupled up and all kinds of orders and everything else is separated and brotherhood scattered everywhere half believe in this and half believing creed and half living denomination hath believing this and that oh my goodness her health ought to be standing perfect rosie seek with the word of god and the power of his a matter of the resurrection of my people where is my daughter a samus signs among them like that they just get up and walk out what's the matter with the daughter of my people when it's explained and proven by the word and the bible said if the always to believe the word the word is confirmed then you cannot disbelieve it but your reasoning letting satan tell you in your mind last night when you held your hand that you was a sinner and didn't want to die a sinner and i called you to the platform turn him walked out what's the matter you let satan reason you're going to lose your job i'd rather lose my job than lose my life your wife will leave you i'd rather lose a wife and lose my christ your husband your neighbor will make fun of you i'd rather than my neighbor and make fun of me and be right with god but you see you're listening to reasons that's it you're just you've had so many bogus things don't you realize friend that every time a bogus thing declares that there's a real one amen sure it does notice god gave his toxin to himself they watched it in a time when they put a rag over his face he could discern the thoughts in the people's heart and they put a rag over his face and hit him on the head with a stick and said now if you are a prophet tell us who hit you and we'll believe you but the toxin helped he wasn't clowning that's what samaritan world today they want some clowning that's watching out this west coast you've got too much hollywood in it you've got too much claire the holy ghost don't shine the holy ghost close there's a difference between glowing and shining the church shines with this big program but the holy ghost glows in humility humbleness reconciling to the word believing the word the old saint one time sitting in a church a few weeks ago i was supposed to be in a chicago meeting and a great minister there said we can't have brother bran because of his doctrine and uh i don't preach a doctrine among them but he just wanted to say that he got some great big fella from some big institute there and he come walking his chest with enough papers laid out there looked like it he could have done anything with it walked up with his chest out throw that back this big book in an intellectual talk it was wonderful his intellectual talk but there's no spirit in it after a while he seemed that didn't go with god's people just like saul trying to put his ecclesiastical vest on david a man of god it didn't fit him and an intellectual message don't fit a spirit-filled church they've got to have the power of the holy spirit and the manifestation jesus said these signs are following they got to have it and then the man found out they didn't take with the pentecostal people he folded up his books and come down with his head an old saint sitting over the corner come told me later said if he would have went up the way he come down he'd come down the way he went up that's about the way it is today what we need is back to the holy ghost back to the bible back to the power of the resurrection of jesus christ not only your reasonings and intellectuals and so forth certainly they found that it helped it held in the hour of death it helped in the hour of gethsemane it helped in all those things then he died he died as i said last night and told everything's declared he was dead the moon sun and stars the earth the earthquakes everything proved he was dead the sun went down in the middle of the day the roman soldiers said truly that was the son of god judah said i betrayed innocent blood pilate said give me some water let me wash my hands i'll have nothing more to do with it he died and he went with that inoculation but it was a inoculation of eternal life on the third day it still helped after the prophecies of god was fulfilled he rose up on the third day alive the church saw it and rejoiced now he said you got to get inoculated too but i want you to go up there and wait until you get your inoculation yeah that's what's the matter with the people today they didn't go up wait for their inoculation they went to the seminary and got their ba instead of going for inoculation going up get some of the bomb of gilead injected into their veins of their soul right it went up there on the day of pentecost they were all symboled together they believed he had raised from the dead to talk with him and he promised he would send down a whole lot of that inoculation and while they were all symboled together the bomb began to fall upon them and clove and tongues set up on them like fire they were all filled with the holy ghost and run in the outside begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance there was a man who a few days before ahead the night jesus stood up on a soapboxer's stump and said you men of judah and the youth dwell in jerusalem let this mean honor you and hearken my words these are not drunk as you suppose since the third holiday but this is that inoculation that was to come that he would inoculate from sin from sickness from death from the grave unto eternal life they've seen it and worked on jesus when they were pricked in their hearts and they said to them man and brother what can we do now they had a doctor there his name was dr simon peter they had a position and they had plenty of inoculations proven it there's all drunk on it they really received in a big way and they had dr simon peter there he said now just a minute if you want to know how to be inoculated i'm going to give you a prescription and don't you fool with it you just keep it because it's going to be for you and to your children to them as far off even as the lord our god shall call i'm going to give you an eternal prescription for the inauguration [Applause] if you want to receive this bomb this bomb of guilt this inoculation from sin and death you receive this prescription any good doctor that measures out his medicine measures correctly i'll tell you brother he told them that he said now today they've substituted things for that prescription they try to say shake hands sprinkle a little bit or something like that but peter said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall be unpopulated [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen if a doctor writes a prescription what's the matter today if that doctor writes a prescription for that disease that was to be an eternal how far to your children they said ended with the apostles it did not the doctor simon peter said it's for you and for your children and to them it's far off even if then is the lord our god shall come [Music] this is their inoculation what's the matter then we see in our churches bob the herod women's wearing sharks paint makeup we see men with wishbones instead of backbones we see preachers in the pulpit with not enough power to break an aide creature hanging over his brother they haven't received inoculation that's all there is to it you know you take a doctor's formula and you go to mason up out of it you'll kill your patient that's right well what's the trouble is some quack drug us out of some seminary has tried to mix this farmer with shaken hands and more bunch of tommy rot that's really got a dead church that we got today is killed because they didn't follow the farmer of the prescription amen amen said don't make no difference paul said it did he said if an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel you let him be accursed [Applause] got dead church members because they're trying to fool with that prescription shake hands sprinkle all other kind of farms and everything else follow exactly what the prescription says if you take some of the antidote out you'll kill the patient if you put too much antidote in the killer in there will kill the disease take it just the way it's wrote amen [Applause] is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there then why is the daughter of my people in the anemic condition is tonight why is it the church is in the conditions in the night because they fool with the prescription yes there's bomb and gilead hallelujah there's a bomb there christ is there he is a bomb be injected with his life he share now he is moving among us we see him working performing signs and wonders among us there's a bomb in gilead and there's doctors here we got doctors that wants to matter it's you patience that won't come up and face the fact of it and follow the firm maybe i said enough may the holy ghost say the rest of it is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there then why is my church in the conditions in tonight there's something wrong somewhere that's right i think we have took a lot of dogma instead of taking the prescription quack seminaries putting out quack prescriptions that's contrary to the original prescription go back that's the way to get it that's the eternal prescription not a shake hand say a creed and a thing like this reap tend to be baptized every everyone of you he said in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost even as many as [Applause] [Music] there's plenty of bomb here there's plenty of toxins [Music] because the people don't want to receive the prescription they got doctors here can write it it's already wrong you don't have to write anymore it's already wrote just say what's already been written then take it like that not a little sissified handshake a little say i'll say the creed the apostles creed i'll say a hail mary every once in a while burn a candle nonsense [Applause] accept and believe the devil believes too i don't make you say but you've got to be born again if you're born again you're born to the word of god because he is the word and the word is in you and it punctuates every sentence with an amen amen let us pray heavenly father there is bomb and gilead i'm so thankful for it i'm so thankful there's physicians that wouldn't mingle with that prescription for nothing not to get members in the church but to get children to god they stay with it not a cold formal handshake a creed or something but a real prescription rolled out by god the father himself and given for an eternal prescription father god he said it was for their children and them it's far off the gentiles even as many as the lord our god should call could receive the holy spirit here we are in the evening nights tonight way back in the beginning before the world was created you had in your mind and then it was a thought then it was expressed and then the expression become real and now god you put our names on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and father god i pray tonight if there's any of that seed laying here in this church tonight i'm no judge you are i only am responsible for preaching your word but if there's any of that seed here tonight lord i believe that light flashes over it's got to come to life it'll see it insures the world because it's predestinated to sin it's got to sin lord you said no man can come to me except my father draws him all that the father has given me will come lord are they here tonight that has
