[11:42] good to be in the house of the lord i
[11:44] we're singing this song
[11:45] i've anchored in jesus
[11:48] sometimes i'll
[11:50] i'll look up in youtube and i'll maybe
[11:52] look at a story or a
[11:54] documentary every once in a while
[11:56] there's one that's showing ships trying
[11:58] to get past
[12:00] the harbor out of the harbor and the
[12:01] jetties and
[12:03] and i watched them in the safety of my
[12:05] seat
[12:06] at home
[12:08] and you're watching the boats getting
[12:09] tossed and turned and some being flipped
[12:11] and all
[12:13] and i kind of you know i get laughter
[12:15] out of it
[12:16] but those folks that went through i
[12:17] don't think we're laughing
[12:19] but you know when you're anchored in
[12:21] jesus and and i don't know if you can't
[12:23] caught me smiling a couple of times i
[12:24] was looking at that and saying
[12:26] i've anchored in him
[12:28] and sometimes i'm kind of laughing at
[12:31] those that are going through what
[12:32] they're going through
[12:33] but my anchor's in him
[12:35] and in life's troubled seas he said i'll
[12:38] get you through it
[12:39] and i appreciate that so
[12:42] you love the lord jesus
[12:45] you love one another
[12:46] he's good to us isn't he
[12:48] you know we we had some some business
[12:51] take here at church after and took a
[12:53] little bit of time and we did
[12:55] and then went to lunch and
[12:57] thought for sure my wife had gone with
[12:59] the girls and
[13:01] me and brother ed or something like that
[13:02] might go to lunch together but she was
[13:04] still waiting for me and so she said
[13:06] well good we'll take advantage of this
[13:08] we'll go somewhere we'll just
[13:10] sit down and have a nice lunch together
[13:12] and all and we did and
[13:15] at the end she said can i order a
[13:16] strawberry shortcake and i said sure
[13:18] it's just me and you anyways you know
[13:21] and nobody's gonna see that i ate some
[13:23] too
[13:24] but uh so they brought us the bill
[13:28] and he said um
[13:29] we're just billing you for this
[13:30] strawberry shortcake
[13:33] i stopped and said
[13:35] i mean we're nobody special why would
[13:36] you do that he said because there were
[13:38] some folks sitting on the other side who
[13:40] said they knew you
[13:42] and
[13:43] the kids knew your kids and stuff like
[13:44] that and they paid your bill already
[13:47] we never saw them we have no idea who it
[13:49] was so if it was one of you thank you
[13:53] but i appreciate that that somebody had
[13:55] dinner
[13:56] but you know
[13:57] it's god that takes care of us it's god
[14:00] that watches over us there's god that
[14:01] does the little things that reminds you
[14:04] that he cares for you so
[14:06] alas
[14:07] and did my savior bleed at the cross
[14:12] you you and i in a sense
[14:16] we get to to read about it
[14:19] we we
[14:21] maybe in our prayers we try to imagine
[14:24] what god went through
[14:26] but he did it
[14:27] and you and i get the benefit of him
[14:33] my
[14:34] savior bleed and did my sovereignty
[14:44] devote that
[14:46] sacred head for such a
[14:50] worm as i'm

[30:44] our freedoms come
[30:46] with a terrible cost

[30:50] jesus paid
[30:52] to secure ours
[30:55] he makes us free
[30:56] to serve

[32:28] into your hands and we thank you
[32:31] in jesus name
[32:32] amen
[32:34] you you may
[32:36] notice the title here is not all that
[32:38] different from
[32:39] the title this morning um
[32:43] but uh when i discovered that brother
[32:45] aaron was going to be talking about what
[32:46] he was going to be talking about i
[32:48] thought
[32:49] i hope it's not the same verses in the
[32:51] same
[32:52] excerpts that i've got um
[32:55] well we'll find out if it is or not if
[32:57] you were here this morning then you can
[32:58] track along and see if this is a
[33:00] repeater if it's part two
[33:02] so while we're standing let's read our
[33:04] topic verse
[33:05] from his love letter to us first
[33:07] corinthians
[33:08] the third chapter and the 16th verse
[33:13] paul says know ye not
[33:16] that ye are the temple of god
[33:19] i'm reminded when i read that verse of
[33:21] solomon's temple in jerusalem built some
[33:24] 3000 years ago
[33:25] a temple it was just a structure a
[33:27] beautiful structure but just stone and
[33:30] wood
[33:31] but there was a second part
[33:33] that occurred at that dedication
[33:35] just as there's a second part to this
[33:37] verse it says and that the spirit of god
[33:41] dwells in you
[33:44] recall at that dedication the spirit of
[33:46] the lord filled the sanctuary
[33:48] we were just talking before the
[33:50] musicians came out this evening
[33:52] in the in the uh portion of it and in
[33:54] kings where it talks about the
[33:56] dedication it says they brought in the
[33:57] ark and the spirit filled the temple
[34:00] but if you read in ii chronicles chapter
[34:02] 5 verse 12 it says after they brought
[34:05] the ark in and before all that happened
[34:07] that the musicians were there the
[34:09] singers and they were in unity raising
[34:11] their voices and that's when the spirit
[34:14] of the lord
[34:15] filled the temple
[34:18] that's the transformation god's presence
[34:20] that makes all the difference
[34:23] i'd like to read this same verse usually
[34:25] i read several verses i've only got one
[34:27] to start tonight but i'd like to read it
[34:30] to you again but from the amplified
[34:32] bible
[34:34] do you not con discern and understand
[34:37] that you
[34:38] the whole church at corinth
[34:40] the whole church at tucson tabernacle
[34:43] are god's temple
[34:45] his sanctuary
[34:46] a sanctuary is a place of refuge it's a
[34:49] place of safety
[34:51] his sanctuary and that god's spirit has
[34:54] his permanent
[34:56] not temporary not like solomon's temple
[34:59] his permanent dwelling in you
[35:01] to be at home
[35:03] in you
[35:04] collectively as a church
[35:06] and also individually
[35:09] please be seated
[35:11] we must never lose sight of the fact
[35:14] that we are a local body
[35:17] we need one another
[35:19] not to forsake to give up assembling
[35:21] together but our walk with christ is
[35:24] also
[35:25] an intensely personal and individual
[35:28] walk the indwelling holy spirit is a
[35:31] consistent theme
[35:33] in paul's epistles
[35:35] the life of christ
[35:37] living
[35:38] and working through us
[35:40] tonight we'll be looking more closely at
[35:42] this
[35:43] tonight's title is living tabernacles
[35:46] our bodies being a temple
[35:49] where the spirit of the almighty is
[35:51] pleased to dwell
[35:53] we'll be reading a lot of scriptures and
[35:54] many excerpts from the sermon of brother
[35:56] branham dealing with this topic
[35:59] what brother lyle says is of little or
[36:02] perhaps even no value
[36:04] but what the scriptures say
[36:06] in them
[36:07] lie the keys to the kingdom
[36:09] to life eternal
[36:11] brother branham sermons also help us
[36:13] better understand those keys how to
[36:16] apply them in our lives
[36:18] paul called this tabernacling of god
[36:20] within humans a great mystery when he
[36:22] wrote to the colossians
[36:24] he says even the mystery which hath been
[36:27] hid from ages and from generations
[36:30] but is now made manifest it's become
[36:33] visible
[36:35] it's come into fruition we can see it
[36:37] to his saints
[36:39] and we include ourselves in that number
[36:41] to whom
[36:43] to who to us
[36:45] god would god willed god desired to make
[36:49] known what is the riches of the glory of
[36:52] this mystery among the gentiles the
[36:55] heathens
[36:56] the non-jewish peoples
[36:59] which is christ in you
[37:02] the hope of glory the hope of life
[37:04] eternal the holy spirit the earnest of
[37:07] the promise of our redemption
[37:10] whom we preach
[37:12] that is we proclaim the indwelling
[37:15] christ warning every man
[37:17] teaching every man and all wisdom that
[37:20] we may present every man perfect that
[37:23] means complete
[37:24] fully mature
[37:26] full-grown
[37:28] and right relationship in christ jesus
[37:33] perfect in the king james version is
[37:35] often a synonym for complete
[37:38] but reading this
[37:40] it raises many questions
[37:42] how does one become perfected how does
[37:45] one
[37:46] become made complete in christ jesus is
[37:49] this the work of the spirit we just sort
[37:51] of sit back and pray and desire it and
[37:53] it happens
[37:55] or do we have an active role to play
[37:58] and if an active rule
[38:01] what is that rule
[38:04] all too often
[38:05] i
[38:07] tend to put my walk with christ is more
[38:10] passive than active
[38:11] that he'll do the work in me
[38:14] but our life in christ
[38:16] is active not passive
[38:19] jesus said to take his yoke
[38:23] that his yoke is easy and his burden is
[38:25] light okay but easy and light are
[38:27] relative they're not absolute terms it's
[38:30] not so many pounds of this or so much
[38:32] pressure or so much strain on a on a
[38:35] yoke but yolk means that you're
[38:37] harnessed
[38:38] you are expected to pull
[38:41] to work
[38:42] to put in effort
[38:44] in tandem with another part of a team
[38:48] burden
[38:49] means you're carrying something and
[38:51] you're expected to carry it not just
[38:53] stand there and hold it or put it down
[38:55] and sit on it
[38:58] we were reminded last week that the
[39:00] bride makes herself ready
[39:02] the groom doesn't make her ready the
[39:04] attendants don't make her ready there's
[39:06] a context of that statement in
[39:08] revelation is first century not 21st
[39:12] century paul wrote
[39:15] one of his last letters to timothy
[39:17] now he was instructing timothy how to be
[39:20] a good minister of jesus christ these
[39:22] admonitions of paul are not just for
[39:24] timothy
[39:25] they're not just for one that's called
[39:27] to ministry
[39:28] they're for each of us
[39:30] we'll just read two verses here first
[39:32] timothy 6
[39:34] verse 11 he says but thou
[39:37] thou
[39:38] is a singular
[39:40] form of second person
[39:42] so it's a personal note it's to each
[39:45] individual
[39:46] thou o man of god
[39:49] place yourself in these words
[39:52] but thou
[39:53] fill in your name child of god flee
[39:57] don't stroll
[39:59] don't look back
[40:00] run
[40:01] from these things
[40:03] in the previous verses paul was
[40:05] lamenting and warning about false
[40:07] teaching seeking wealth and reputation
[40:11] instead seek and follow after
[40:14] righteousness
[40:16] godliness
[40:18] faith
[40:19] love
[40:21] patience
[40:22] meekness
[40:24] fight the good fight of faith
[40:27] one who fights is not one who's sitting
[40:30] down
[40:31] this isn't some sort of a computer game
[40:33] set in a virtual make-believe alternate
[40:35] reality
[40:38] lay hold on eternal life to lay hold
[40:42] means grasping hanging onto it once it's
[40:45] in your grip not letting go
[40:47] not releasing it
[40:49] once you've got it
[40:51] hang on to it don't lose it possess it
[40:55] where unto
[40:56] thou art also called
[40:59] you're called to eternal life
[41:02] value it
[41:03] cleave to it
[41:05] don't let it slip away
[41:07] and has professed a good profession
[41:10] before many witnesses
[41:13] these are resounding words of
[41:14] encouragement
[41:16] but what do they mean
[41:19] what is godliness
[41:20] what does paul mean by the terms
[41:23] patience
[41:24] or faith
[41:25] or love
[41:27] is faith of necessity a fight
[41:30] how does one grasp
[41:32] eternal life
[41:35] peter once wrote that
[41:36] paul's not always so easy to understand
[41:40] i'm going to read what peter said about
[41:41] that and i'm going to read it in the niv
[41:43] so it'll be even easier to understand
[41:47] ii peter 3
[41:48] 15
[41:49] he says bear in mind
[41:52] that our lord's patience
[41:54] his patience with us is what's implied
[41:57] the lord's patience with us means
[41:59] salvation
[42:00] just as our dear brother paul also wrote
[42:02] you with the wisdom that god gave him
[42:05] he writes the same way consistently and
[42:08] all his letters speaking in them of
[42:11] these matters
[42:13] his letters contain some things that are
[42:15] hard to understand
[42:17] which ignorant and unstable people
[42:19] distort
[42:21] as they do other scriptures to their own
[42:23] destruction
[42:25] the other
[42:27] scriptures
[42:29] peter here is equating paul's then
[42:32] current letters his then current
[42:34] ministry as being equivalent to the
[42:37] hebrew bible
[42:39] to the tanakh
[42:41] other scriptures
[42:43] i imagine peter took some flack for that
[42:46] well let's turn to peter he's presumably
[42:49] easier to understand than paul
[42:52] and his words should align with paul's
[42:54] since the holy spirit was directing the
[42:57] thoughts of both apostles
[43:00] now we're going to be reading from
[43:02] second peter chapter one
[43:04] this was the text that brother branham
[43:06] used in a sermon that he titled the
[43:08] stature of a perfect man
[43:11] he preached that sermon october 14
[43:14] of 1962
[43:16] and we'll take several brief excerpts
[43:18] from that
[43:21] to any of you remember october
[43:24] 1962 uh
[43:27] now some of you probably are too young
[43:30] for that
[43:32] um i remember it i was 12 years old
[43:36] it was a cuban missile crisis
[43:38] the united states and russia on the
[43:40] brink of nuclear war
[43:42] at the very moment
[43:45] that brother branham was preaching the
[43:47] statue of a perfect man the morning of
[43:50] october 14
[43:52] 1962
[43:53] we read got this from wikipedia the u.s
[43:56] first obtained u2 photographic evidence
[43:59] of the missiles
[44:00] on october 14
[44:02] when a u2 flight took 928 pictures on a
[44:05] path selected by defense intelligence
[44:08] agency analysts
[44:09] capturing images of where town turned
[44:11] out to be ss4 construction site at san
[44:14] cristobal and western cuba
[44:18] the very moment that brother branham was
[44:20] speaking this was the very moment that
[44:22] we were discovering that we were on the
[44:24] path to possible destruction
[44:27] the films were developed within two days
[44:28] they were presented to president kennedy
[44:30] within a few days he put up a naval
[44:32] blockade around cuba to interdict any
[44:35] ships going in
[44:36] verify they don't have offensive weapons
[44:38] and let them pass if they have offensive
[44:40] weapons turn them back
[44:42] it brought america and russia the
[44:44] closest we've ever been
[44:46] to nuclear war
[44:49] i remember that october i was in the
[44:51] seventh grade i had just started the
[44:53] seventh grade
[44:54] and uh my best friend fred steinert and
[44:57] i were walking down the the hallways and
[44:59] the school there between classes and we
[45:01] looked at each other
[45:04] and asked each other
[45:06] we're 12 years old
[45:08] are we ready to die
[45:11] is there going to be nuclear war
[45:12] remember this was a time when kids when
[45:14] they went to school they were taught how
[45:16] to hide under the desks for when the
[45:17] bombs fell and all the rest of it this
[45:19] this was the cold war this was a very
[45:21] serious time to us it's it's chillingly
[45:23] similar in some ways to what we see
[45:26] happening now in ukraine
[45:28] well let's read now from ii peter
[45:33] ii peter
[45:35] chapter one
[45:36] first verse
[45:38] simon peter
[45:40] a servant
[45:41] literally a slave and an apostle
[45:44] a sent one an ambassador
[45:47] a representative of jesus christ to them
[45:50] that have obtained like precious faith
[45:54] obtained
[45:56] you you weren't born with it you had to
[45:58] get it you had to go out and get it to
[46:00] receive and accept it
[46:02] this letters to us if we've obtained
[46:05] that faith it's been preserved for 20
[46:07] centuries
[46:08] so we can read it tonight may 29th 2022
[46:12] in tucson arizona
[46:14] obtained like precious faith with us
[46:17] peter had to obtain it too
[46:20] through the righteousness of god and our
[46:23] savior jesus christ
[46:25] he's the only source of it
[46:28] grace
[46:30] and peace
[46:31] be multiplied unto you
[46:34] continuing
[46:35] more and more
[46:37] unmerited favor from god
[46:40] and the confidence of faith that brings
[46:42] peace
[46:43] in the midst of tumult and turmoil
[46:46] how
[46:47] through the knowledge of god
[46:50] and of jesus our lord
[46:53] not only our savior
[46:55] our personal lord
[46:57] and he's also the capital lord the
[47:00] creator and source of everything
[47:03] according as his
[47:06] who's
[47:07] jesus divine power hath given unto us
[47:12] we didn't buy it
[47:14] we didn't earn it
[47:16] it was gifted
[47:17] hath given to us
[47:19] all
[47:20] things not a partial set not an
[47:23] incomplete fulfillment but everything we
[47:25] need that pertains
[47:27] associated required unto life and
[47:31] godliness
[47:32] through the knowledge of him through
[47:34] knowing him
[47:35] that hath called us to glory
[47:38] and virtue
[47:40] his glory
[47:41] not ours
[47:42] we'll talk about virtue just a bit later
[47:46] whereby that whereby means in accordance
[47:49] with which are given unto us exceeding
[47:52] great
[47:53] and precious promises
[47:56] very great
[47:57] valuable extremely precious commitments
[48:01] a promise is a commitment
[48:03] and this is his commitment to us
[48:08] that by these these promises that ye
[48:11] this is a plural form now
[48:13] is addressed to all of us that you might
[48:15] be partakers of participate in
[48:19] share
[48:20] the divine nature
[48:24] can you begin to grasp what that means
[48:28] the awesome overwhelming gift that this
[48:31] is to partake of the divine nature the
[48:34] one who created all things
[48:36] and by whom all things consist
[48:40] having escaped
[48:42] escaped
[48:44] its past tense
[48:46] our state our condition is that of an
[48:49] escapee
[48:51] to escape is to break free from
[48:52] confinement but not by the will of the
[48:54] one that's confining you
[48:56] somebody escapes from prison there
[48:58] whoever had them under confinement is
[49:00] usually chasing them to put them back
[49:02] into confinement
[49:04] that's our state
[49:06] it's not like paul being released by the
[49:08] philippian authorities it's more like
[49:11] peter being in jail and the angel comes
[49:13] in and breaks the chains that has him
[49:15] chained to the guards and opens the
[49:16] doors and escorts them out
[49:19] the guards didn't want him to go
[49:22] and what is the confinement
[49:25] that we've escaped from but is still
[49:27] pursuing us to trap us again
[49:29] the corruption
[49:31] the rottenness
[49:32] the moral decay
[49:34] that is in the world through lust
[49:37] through covetousness
[49:39] through greed
[49:40] various
[49:42] human desires
[49:44] and beside this for this very reason and
[49:47] view of all this giving all diligence
[49:51] add to your faith
[49:53] employing every effort in exercising
[49:55] your faith peter now this additional
[49:57] qualities necessary
[50:00] to become complete in christ
[50:03] add to your faith virtue
[50:06] and to virtue
[50:07] knowledge
[50:08] and to knowledge temperance
[50:11] and your temperance
[50:12] patience
[50:14] and to patience godliness
[50:16] to godliness
[50:19] brotherly kindness
[50:21] to brotherly kindness
[50:23] charity
[50:24] love peter now continues by explaining
[50:28] why these characteristics are necessary
[50:31] to produce in the life of a christian
[50:34] he says for if these things that's a
[50:36] condition be in you
[50:38] and abound you possess these qualities
[50:42] in great measure
[50:43] they make that you shall neither be
[50:45] barren nor unfruitful
[50:47] in other words you will
[50:49] be fruitful and the knowledge of our
[50:52] lord jesus christ
[50:54] and he had just explained the value of
[50:56] that but he that lacks these things
[51:00] is blind
[51:01] can't see afar off
[51:03] has forgotten that he was purged from
[51:05] his old sins
[51:07] his life has not been transformed
[51:10] we're for the rather
[51:12] instead of lacking these things brethren
[51:15] give diligence make continued sincere
[51:18] effort
[51:19] self-examination to make your calling
[51:21] get election sure
[51:23] to be certain
[51:25] anchored
[51:27] for if you do these things
[51:29] being diligent
[51:31] you shall never fall
[51:33] that's quite a promise
[51:35] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[51:37] unto you abundantly in other words
[51:39] you'll be joyfully welcomed into the
[51:42] everlasting kingdom of our lord and
[51:44] savior jesus christ wherefore
[51:47] to make sure you don't fall
[51:49] i will not be negligent to put you
[51:51] always in remembrance
[51:53] i'll be constantly reminding you of
[51:56] these things
[51:57] though you know them and be established
[52:00] in the present truth
[52:02] yeah
[52:02] i i think it's me it's appropriate as
[52:05] long as i'm living in this tabernacle of
[52:08] flesh
[52:09] to stir you up
[52:11] get your attention
[52:13] shake you
[52:15] how
[52:16] by putting you in remembrance
[52:19] by reminding you
[52:21] again
[52:23] and again
[52:24] and again
[52:27] peter concludes this portion of his
[52:29] letter by explaining that though these
[52:32] are not new things he's telling us it's
[52:34] necessary
[52:36] to be reminded of them
[52:39] well let's go back and work through that
[52:41] list
[52:42] that's what brother branham did in 1962
[52:44] and it's what i had in my heart to do
[52:46] tonight in 2022.
[52:49] paul tells us in ephesians 4 some goals
[52:51] of christian ministry he says
[52:53] he gave that is jesus provided some
[52:56] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[52:59] some pastors and teachers
[53:02] why
[53:03] for what purpose
[53:05] for the perfecting of the saints
[53:07] for the work of the ministry
[53:10] for the edifying of the body of christ
[53:14] how long will such ministry be necessary
[53:17] how long will it continue
[53:19] how long do you got to put up with me
[53:22] till we come to the unity of faith
[53:25] and the knowledge of the son of god unto
[53:28] a perfect man
[53:30] unto the measure of the stature of the
[53:32] fullness of christ
[53:35] the stature of a perfect man that's what
[53:37] brother branham called that
[53:39] with that background
[53:41] let's examine more closely the list that
[53:43] peter provided us
[53:45] he said beside this
[53:47] giving all diligence
[53:50] add to your faith
[53:52] the foundation
[53:53] the beginning
[53:55] the basis on which all will be added
[53:59] is that of faith
[54:01] a faith is more than hope
[54:03] it's the substance and evidence
[54:05] of our hope
[54:07] it's our assurance in the face of
[54:09] apparent physical evidence to the
[54:11] contrary we're all familiar with hebrews
[54:14] 11th chapter
[54:16] abraham and sarah were too old to have
[54:19] children
[54:20] yet they persisted in their insistence
[54:22] that god had promised them a son
[54:24] together
[54:26] after 25 years
[54:28] god brought that promise to pass in
[54:30] their lives we often focus on abraham's
[54:32] side of this
[54:34] but paul makes it very clear in hebrews
[54:36] 11 that sarah was also
[54:38] a hero of faith
[54:41] once isaac was born they didn't need
[54:43] faith for having a son
[54:45] they had him
[54:47] but until they did
[54:49] they had to have faith
[54:51] noah had faith that god had told him to
[54:53] build a big wooden boat
[54:55] to survive a massive flood
[54:58] whatever that is
[55:00] noah labored for 120 years
[55:03] constructing it
[55:05] telling people about the judgment that
[55:06] was to come
[55:09] by and through his faith
[55:12] he and his family
[55:14] survived that flood
[55:16] without not just his faith but his
[55:19] tireless action based on that faith
[55:24] none of us would be here
[55:26] human life would have been extinguished
[55:30] i sometimes remind you about god healing
[55:32] my heart
[55:34] faith trusted that he would once he did
[55:37] i didn't need that faith i had the
[55:40] testimony of the result
[55:42] now my faith is god will continue to
[55:44] keep my heart strong until his purpose
[55:47] for my life is fulfilled
[55:49] until then
[55:51] you might have to put up with this old
[55:53] man for a while
[55:54] but faith is the foundation
[55:57] jesus told nicodemus he must be born
[56:00] again
[56:01] it was necessary
[56:02] it was not optional
[56:04] our faith must be based on his word
[56:08] frankly
[56:10] i think it takes less faith
[56:12] to accept the authority of the bible
[56:14] today
[56:15] than it did in previous generations
[56:18] how can you say that brother lyle
[56:21] the bible claims for example in its
[56:23] opening line
[56:25] that there was a beginning to our
[56:26] universe
[56:28] and to time itself but as a kid i was
[56:31] taught in school that the universe was
[56:33] infinite
[56:34] and it was always there
[56:37] if you have a basic understanding of
[56:39] newtonian physics
[56:41] that has to be the case
[56:43] that has to be if not
[56:45] if it weren't infinite in dimension it
[56:47] would collapse on itself due to gravity
[56:50] but for all of that to be in balance
[56:52] there has to be graph there has to be
[56:54] objects going out
[56:56] literally to infinity
[56:58] so it seemed that that evidence science
[57:01] at that time as they interpreted based
[57:03] on
[57:04] the laws of physics that newton had
[57:07] proclaimed
[57:08] that
[57:09] that science in the bible
[57:11] we're not in agreement
[57:14] but in the 20th century
[57:16] and the faith of skepticism and face of
[57:19] skepticism man's rapidly growing
[57:21] understanding of the physical universe
[57:23] we had minds like that of albert
[57:25] einstein showing us through relativity
[57:27] that newtonian physics was just a subset
[57:30] of the laws that govern the universe
[57:32] he also delved into the properties of
[57:34] light we have a much better
[57:35] understanding now of why god compared
[57:38] himself to light
[57:41] instruments like the hubble space
[57:42] telescope help us observe that in fact
[57:44] the universe is not infinite
[57:46] and it did have a beginning
[57:49] the web space telescope
[57:51] will enable us to see almost
[57:54] to that very beginning
[57:56] we've had physicists like stephen
[57:57] hawkings essentially proving the
[57:59] universe came into being by a force or
[58:02] source that transcends space and time
[58:06] god is not limited to this universe he's
[58:10] much greater than it he created it
[58:13] science our attempt to observe and
[58:16] explain the physical universe that we
[58:18] inhabit
[58:20] on the one hand and the biblical
[58:22] narrative on the other
[58:25] are not in conflict
[58:26] it's our incomplete
[58:29] and imperfect understanding of each
[58:32] that leads us to suppose that they're
[58:33] not in agreement but the more we
[58:35] understand both the clearer it becomes
[58:39] that they're in complete harmony
[58:42] job tells us speaking of the lord
[58:45] which do with great things past finding
[58:47] out yea and wonders without number
[58:52] the psalmist wrote some three millennia
[58:54] ago the heavens declare the glory of god
[58:57] and the firmament chose his handiwork
[59:00] day and to day utter speech and night
[59:02] unto tonight shows knowledge
[59:04] there's no speech nor language where
[59:07] their voice is not heard the heavens are
[59:09] visible from anywhere on earth
[59:12] in plain sight
[59:14] just look up
[59:16] so our foundation
[59:18] is that of faith
[59:20] and the word of god the authority of the
[59:23] scriptures
[59:24] from them
[59:25] we learn the very first step is in fact
[59:28] faith
[59:29] we must be born again accepting jesus
[59:32] christ as our god and savior the lord
[59:36] who created our universe
[59:39] including ourselves
[59:41] but that's just the first step
[59:45] and beside this
[59:47] peter says giving all diligence add to
[59:50] your faith
[59:51] virtue
[59:54] virtue
[59:55] we're all familiar with the story
[59:58] from the gospels about one aspect of
[1:00:00] virtue jairus an official in a local
[1:00:03] synagogue had come to jesus
[1:00:05] asked him to come and heal his daughter
[1:00:08] his only child who lay at the point of
[1:00:10] death
[1:00:12] jesus agreed to come with him
[1:00:15] let's examine this story from mark's
[1:00:17] account it's also found in luke
[1:00:21] jesus went with jairus
[1:00:23] and much people followed him
[1:00:25] and thronged him he's being jostled by
[1:00:29] the crowd
[1:00:30] the curious
[1:00:32] and a certain woman
[1:00:34] which had an issue of blood 12 years
[1:00:38] and had suffered many things of many
[1:00:41] physicians
[1:00:42] had spent all that she had
[1:00:45] it was nothing bettered
[1:00:47] but grew worse
[1:00:50] when she heard of jesus
[1:00:53] came in the press behind and touched his
[1:00:56] garment
[1:00:58] she's declared unclean
[1:01:00] she's violating the religious law you
[1:01:02] can read it in leviticus 15.
[1:01:05] by coming into the crowd she had to
[1:01:07] isolate herself it's like coveted 19
[1:01:10] right she had to be in isolation but she
[1:01:12] broke that rule of isolation
[1:01:15] perhaps she's known by some people oh
[1:01:18] don't get close to her because then we
[1:01:20] become unclean and maybe by them
[1:01:22] stepping back from her that created a
[1:01:25] means for her to approach jesus
[1:01:28] but she didn't come from the front
[1:01:30] she came from behind she came stealthily
[1:01:35] through the jostling
[1:01:36] crowd she said
[1:01:39] if i may touch but his clothes
[1:01:43] i shall be whole
[1:01:44] not
[1:01:45] maybe i'll be okay or perhaps if i tug
[1:01:48] on his robe he'll turn around and then
[1:01:50] he'll be able to lay hands on me heal me
[1:01:52] no no no
[1:01:54] if i can just touch his garment
[1:01:57] i shall be made whole
[1:01:59] that was her faith
[1:02:01] faith in action
[1:02:03] violating the rules the law risking
[1:02:05] everything
[1:02:07] to approach jesus
[1:02:09] not openly
[1:02:11] she's unclean stealthily
[1:02:14] from behind
[1:02:15] and straightway instantly
[1:02:18] the fountain of her blood was dried up
[1:02:21] and she felt in her body
[1:02:23] that she was healed of that plague
[1:02:27] her faith is answered
[1:02:29] her healing secured
[1:02:31] not just healing but miraculous healing
[1:02:35] instant
[1:02:39] and jesus
[1:02:41] immediately knowing in himself that
[1:02:43] virtue in this case
[1:02:45] healing power
[1:02:47] that strength had gone out of him
[1:02:51] to the extent that he could feel it
[1:02:54] he turned him about in the press
[1:02:57] in the press mind you and said
[1:02:59] who touched my
[1:03:01] clothes not who touched me not who
[1:03:03] grabbed me not who yanked
[1:03:05] not who pestered or pulled or punched
[1:03:08] who
[1:03:09] touched
[1:03:10] my clothes
[1:03:15] many no doubt were touching and jostling
[1:03:18] him with his clothing to the extent the
[1:03:20] disciples were perplexed by this
[1:03:22] question
[1:03:24] but this was an intentional deliberate
[1:03:27] act
[1:03:28] that he detected not just jostling by
[1:03:31] the curious in a crowd and his disciples
[1:03:34] said to him
[1:03:35] you see the multitude that's thronging
[1:03:38] you and how can you say
[1:03:40] who touched me
[1:03:41] but he didn't say who touched me he said
[1:03:44] who touched my clothes
[1:03:46] so jesus
[1:03:48] ignoring them
[1:03:50] looked around about to see her that had
[1:03:52] done this thing
[1:03:54] not being contacted by the merely
[1:03:56] curious but a desperate person quietly
[1:03:58] reaching out and determined faith
[1:04:02] but the woman fearing
[1:04:04] because she was violating god's laws of
[1:04:06] isolation
[1:04:07] would she be sternly rebuked
[1:04:10] humiliated
[1:04:11] punished
[1:04:13] and trembling
[1:04:15] perhaps also enjoying excitement due to
[1:04:17] her miraculous healing whatever happens
[1:04:19] i'm healed
[1:04:21] knowing what was done in her came and
[1:04:23] fell down before him
[1:04:26] and told him all the truth
[1:04:29] her healing
[1:04:31] led to her testimony
[1:04:32] in front of a crowd of witnesses
[1:04:35] a crowd of witnesses that were following
[1:04:37] him
[1:04:39] for the healing of jairus daughter
[1:04:42] and he didn't scold her for coming but
[1:04:44] said unto her daughter thy faith hath
[1:04:47] made thee whole go in peace
[1:04:50] and behold of thy plague
[1:04:53] you're not only healed you're safe from
[1:04:55] any penalty associated with coming into
[1:04:58] a crowd in your former condition
[1:05:01] when the fringe of jesus garment was
[1:05:03] touched by a woman of faith who in faith
[1:05:06] reached out to him
[1:05:08] jesus stopped and asked who touched not
[1:05:11] grasped
[1:05:12] but simply touched my clothes
[1:05:16] now she had reached out to physicians
[1:05:18] to no avail she had faith in them why
[1:05:21] else would she reach out to them why
[1:05:22] else would she pay them
[1:05:25] but nothing helped her
[1:05:26] until she reached out to jesus
[1:05:30] what was the difference
[1:05:32] he had the virtue
[1:05:34] the strength to respond to her faith
[1:05:39] and to her plight
[1:05:41] that virtue that power that strength can
[1:05:44] only flow out
[1:05:48] if it's there to flow i'm not going to
[1:05:50] flow this out it's okay
[1:05:58] we must have it
[1:05:59] so it can flow out from us
[1:06:02] we can't just hold it and contain it
[1:06:04] that's not the purpose but we're to be a
[1:06:06] channel or to be an outlet to help
[1:06:09] others
[1:06:11] and it isn't just something that god
[1:06:12] plops on our lap
[1:06:15] we must exercise our faith to build up
[1:06:19] this sort of strength brother branham
[1:06:20] talked about exercising faith muscles
[1:06:24] muscles not exercised atrophy and lose
[1:06:26] the strength they once had a few years
[1:06:28] ago
[1:06:30] i had a a blood vessel a couple of them
[1:06:33] burst in my leg
[1:06:35] and i wound up having to
[1:06:37] stay in bed for a few weeks and and i
[1:06:39] don't have a very muscular thigh but you
[1:06:41] can see that my thumbs are about four
[1:06:42] inches apart
[1:06:44] well my thumbs overlap by about four
[1:06:46] inches after about three weeks in bed
[1:06:49] just from simply not being able to
[1:06:51] exercise that leg
[1:06:53] atrophy it doesn't take long it takes a
[1:06:55] while to build it back up trust me but
[1:06:58] it goes away very very quickly so you
[1:07:01] have to exercise your faith and not just
[1:07:03] on sunday and not just on wednesday you
[1:07:05] have to exercise that faith go to the
[1:07:07] spiritual gym every day right
[1:07:11] brother branham speaking about this
[1:07:13] attribute of virtue said live like a
[1:07:16] christian
[1:07:17] act like a christian
[1:07:19] be a christian
[1:07:24] beside this
[1:07:25] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:07:27] virtue add to your virtue
[1:07:29] not that you're exercising your faith
[1:07:31] and knowledge
[1:07:33] knowledge isn't just
[1:07:34] reasoning
[1:07:36] you measure things by the word
[1:07:38] second timothy 2 15
[1:07:40] paul admonishes or encourages timothy he
[1:07:44] says study
[1:07:45] to show yourself approved unto god
[1:07:48] a workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[1:07:51] rightly dividing
[1:07:53] the word of truth
[1:07:55] rightly dividing paul till timothy
[1:07:57] dividing what too often we see people
[1:07:59] busy dividing fellowships dividing the
[1:08:02] body of christ
[1:08:03] no we're supposed to be able to rightly
[1:08:06] divide the word of truth we need to
[1:08:08] spend time in the bible
[1:08:10] and the sermons are brother branham
[1:08:12] knowledge must be acquired
[1:08:14] you don't swallow a pill or have a
[1:08:16] prayer and suddenly you're filled with
[1:08:18] knowledge
[1:08:19] it requires time
[1:08:21] in study
[1:08:22] and as one acquires knowledge of god one
[1:08:25] must seek and use wisdom
[1:08:27] to apply it
[1:08:28] to rightly divide it
[1:08:30] here's what brother branham said about
[1:08:32] this kind of knowledge from statue of a
[1:08:34] perfect man he says i believe in genuine
[1:08:37] holy ghost knowledge
[1:08:39] holy ghost knowledge will always
[1:08:41] punctuate the word with amen
[1:08:44] when you get these things that seem to
[1:08:46] contradict themselves in the bible
[1:08:50] you sit down
[1:08:51] study it
[1:08:53] prayerfully like that
[1:08:55] and the first thing you know
[1:08:57] the holy spirit begins to move in
[1:09:01] after a while
[1:09:03] you see it ties together and there you
[1:09:07] got it
[1:09:08] see
[1:09:09] that's knowledge
[1:09:12] that's the kind of knowledge we need in
[1:09:13] our christian walk
[1:09:15] and that's how we acquire it
[1:09:18] that's how we can confess that jesus
[1:09:20] christ is the same yesterday and today
[1:09:24] and forever
[1:09:26] faith
[1:09:27] virtue
[1:09:29] knowledge
[1:09:31] what's next in peter's list
[1:09:34] faith virtue knowledge add to knowledge
[1:09:37] temperance
[1:09:40] temperance
[1:09:42] control your tongue and your temper
[1:09:44] is how brother branham defined
[1:09:46] temperance let's read his comments about
[1:09:48] this
[1:09:50] temperance doesn't mean stop drinking
[1:09:53] alcohol
[1:09:54] here either no no temperance doesn't
[1:09:56] mean alcoholic cure not in this case
[1:09:58] remember
[1:09:59] we're talking from 1916 he grew up
[1:10:02] during prohibition and
[1:10:04] so forth in america the temperance
[1:10:06] societies and so forth so he says
[1:10:09] this isn't that this is bible temperance
[1:10:12] this holy spirit temperance
[1:10:14] that's just one of the lusts of the
[1:10:15] flesh but we're talking about holy
[1:10:17] spirit temperance that means
[1:10:20] how to control your tongue
[1:10:24] not be a tattler that was me it's not in
[1:10:27] the text
[1:10:29] not fly off every time anybody speaks
[1:10:31] crossed you
[1:10:32] oh my
[1:10:34] boy
[1:10:35] a lot of us are going to fall off before
[1:10:36] we get started aren't we
[1:10:38] see
[1:10:39] then we wonder why god is not in his
[1:10:41] church doing miracles and things that
[1:10:43] they used to do
[1:10:45] yes sir
[1:10:46] see
[1:10:47] add these things
[1:10:49] add temperance to it
[1:10:51] oh temperance how to answer in kindness
[1:10:53] when wrath has spoke to you
[1:10:56] somebody say are you a bunch of holy
[1:10:57] rollers down there don't jump up and
[1:10:59] roll up your sleeves now
[1:11:01] no
[1:11:02] not that
[1:11:06] talk with godly love
[1:11:08] temperance
[1:11:10] kindness
[1:11:11] is that the way you want to be
[1:11:13] when you're riled upon
[1:11:16] rile not back
[1:11:18] let him be your example
[1:11:21] now remember before his conversion
[1:11:23] brother branham was a fighter
[1:11:26] and he said that as a young man he had a
[1:11:27] temper that would fight a buzz saw
[1:11:30] so when he says somebody says means rile
[1:11:32] don't rile back he's talking about
[1:11:35] a changed life
[1:11:38] james
[1:11:39] wrote about temperance too
[1:11:42] in particular
[1:11:43] the part about controlling our tongue
[1:11:46] remember we're talking about being
[1:11:48] living tabernacles
[1:11:50] houses for the holy spirit to dwell
[1:11:53] temples james 3
[1:11:56] for in many things we offend all if any
[1:11:59] man offend not in word the same as a
[1:12:01] perfect man
[1:12:03] our topic a tabernacle for the holy
[1:12:05] spirit
[1:12:06] and able also to bridle the whole body
[1:12:10] behold we put bits in the horse's mouth
[1:12:12] that they may obey us and we turn about
[1:12:14] their whole body
[1:12:18] behold also the ships which though they
[1:12:20] be so great and are driven of fierce
[1:12:22] winds
[1:12:24] yet they're turned about with a very
[1:12:25] small helm weathers whoever the governor
[1:12:28] listeth
[1:12:30] even so
[1:12:31] the tonga is a little member
[1:12:33] and boasteth great things behold how
[1:12:36] great a matter a little fire kindleth
[1:12:39] and the tongue is a fire a world of
[1:12:42] iniquity so is the tongue among our
[1:12:44] members that it defileth the whole body
[1:12:46] set up on fire the course of nature
[1:12:49] and is set on fire of hell
[1:12:51] for every kind of beast and birds
[1:12:53] serpents things in the sea is tamed has
[1:12:56] been tamed of mankind
[1:12:58] but the tongue can no man tame
[1:13:00] it requires the holy spirit
[1:13:03] it's an unruly evil
[1:13:05] full of deadly poison
[1:13:09] being tortured and crucified
[1:13:12] jesus tongue uttered
[1:13:14] father
[1:13:15] forgive them
[1:13:17] they don't know what they're doing
[1:13:19] he's our example
[1:13:23] moving on
[1:13:26] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:13:29] add to temperance
[1:13:31] patience
[1:13:34] the bible speaks a lot about patience
[1:13:37] you know i
[1:13:39] when i realized i was going to be most
[1:13:42] likely speaking tonight a few days ago i
[1:13:44] started working on things and praying
[1:13:46] and asking the lord and i was taking
[1:13:47] notes and i just couldn't get any
[1:13:49] traction and it wasn't until thursday i
[1:13:52] think that i indicated that
[1:13:54] something is finally clicking here
[1:13:58] patience look it up in a concordance do
[1:14:01] a search with ease or or a similar tool
[1:14:04] i'll just touch on it here and
[1:14:06] let brother branham expand on this
[1:14:09] attribute james tells us
[1:14:11] my brethren
[1:14:13] count it all joy
[1:14:14] when you fall into diverse temptations
[1:14:16] of various tests
[1:14:19] knowing this
[1:14:21] that the trying of your faith the
[1:14:22] testing of your faith
[1:14:24] works
[1:14:26] patience
[1:14:28] but allow let allow patients have her
[1:14:30] perfect work or complete work
[1:14:35] through the testings of your faith
[1:14:38] that she may be perfect and entire
[1:14:40] wanting lacking
[1:14:42] nothing
[1:14:44] being made perfect
[1:14:46] whole
[1:14:47] complete a temple for the spirit of god
[1:14:50] abraham had patience for 25 years
[1:14:53] noah
[1:14:54] 420
[1:14:56] isaiah tells us
[1:14:58] they that wait upon the lord
[1:15:00] will renew their strength
[1:15:03] how long are we willing to wait
[1:15:09] again from statue of a perfect man
[1:15:13] we find god come this far waiting for
[1:15:16] the church too but it'll be there don't
[1:15:18] you worry he promised it
[1:15:20] waited all this time for a
[1:15:22] resurrection they'll be one
[1:15:25] don't worry
[1:15:27] god promised it
[1:15:29] just wait
[1:15:30] patiently
[1:15:31] you fall asleep that will you might take
[1:15:34] a little nap before it happens but
[1:15:35] you'll wake up at that time he promised
[1:15:38] it see a nap like what we call a nap of
[1:15:40] death you know
[1:15:42] what we call death just a little nap
[1:15:44] sleeping in christ
[1:15:46] no such thing as dying in christ life
[1:15:49] and death don't exist together see
[1:15:52] we just take a nap
[1:15:54] an app our friends can't call us from
[1:15:55] he's the only one can call
[1:15:58] he'll call and i'll answer him said job
[1:16:01] job has been sleeping now for 4 000
[1:16:04] years
[1:16:05] don't worry
[1:16:06] he'll wake up
[1:16:08] don't worry
[1:16:10] he's still waiting
[1:16:12] a little bit further
[1:16:14] he's talking about moses
[1:16:16] and the deliverance from the captivity
[1:16:19] of egypt
[1:16:21] he says they that wait upon the lord
[1:16:23] shall renew their strength see just wait
[1:16:25] on the lord
[1:16:27] have patience
[1:16:28] see yes sir then israel was going to be
[1:16:31] taken out the great contrast came and
[1:16:33] moses waited then he got in the
[1:16:35] wilderness
[1:16:36] it's only about a three or four days
[1:16:38] journey
[1:16:40] it's only about 40 miles from where he
[1:16:42] crossed there right across where they
[1:16:44] crossed again
[1:16:45] but moses in the wilderness
[1:16:48] waited 40 years
[1:16:50] patience
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:53] that's right he waited 40 years
[1:16:56] oh yes sir and we should have patience
[1:16:59] with one another too
[1:17:01] see one time we get so much impatient
[1:17:04] with one another
[1:17:06] well later in this sermon he speaks of
[1:17:08] the day of pentecost recorded in the
[1:17:10] book of acts
[1:17:12] how about the pentecostal people he's
[1:17:13] not talking about a denomination he's
[1:17:16] talking about the day of pentecost
[1:17:19] as long as they got the commission
[1:17:21] wait until
[1:17:23] see wait until you're imbued with power
[1:17:26] how long
[1:17:28] they didn't have the question how long
[1:17:29] will it be they just got the answer
[1:17:32] wait until
[1:17:34] they went up there
[1:17:36] now this is the ascension jesus is left
[1:17:38] and i said wait until
[1:17:41] so that was 40 days after easter right
[1:17:43] it's still 10 days until pentecost
[1:17:46] said all right boys maybe 15 minutes
[1:17:48] from now the holy spirit's going to be
[1:17:49] on us we're going to have our ministry
[1:17:53] oh 15 minutes passed
[1:17:56] nobody a day passed
[1:18:00] no
[1:18:01] two
[1:18:02] three
[1:18:04] four
[1:18:05] five six seven
[1:18:07] some of them might have said hey don't
[1:18:08] you think we already got it oh no no no
[1:18:11] no no that's right you better come on
[1:18:14] out boys devil said you know you've
[1:18:16] already got what you want go on start
[1:18:17] your ministry
[1:18:20] no
[1:18:21] no we ain't got it yet because he said
[1:18:24] there will come what would take place in
[1:18:25] the last days with stammering lips and
[1:18:28] other tongues will i speak to this
[1:18:29] people and this is the rest that i said
[1:18:32] see isaiah 28 19.
[1:18:38] said this is it you
[1:18:40] you'll you'll get it when
[1:18:42] we'll know when it comes
[1:18:44] we'll know when it comes we'll know it
[1:18:46] promise of the father
[1:18:49] very waited nine days
[1:18:51] and then on the tenth day
[1:18:53] we were there
[1:18:54] they had patience
[1:18:56] to wait
[1:18:58] now if you've got that kind of patience
[1:19:00] after god gives you a promise and you
[1:19:02] see it in the bible it's mine
[1:19:04] then wait
[1:19:07] then if you've got that kind of patience
[1:19:10] add it to your faith
[1:19:13] well peter has a few more attributes to
[1:19:16] consider so don't get impatient with me
[1:19:17] i know the clock is ticking
[1:19:20] beside this
[1:19:23] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[1:19:25] temperance patience
[1:19:27] godliness
[1:19:29] godliness
[1:19:31] that that's quite simply to be like god
[1:19:36] easy to say
[1:19:38] as his sons and his daughters
[1:19:40] we should reflect his nature
[1:19:43] godliness is listed after patience which
[1:19:46] james said should be allowed to have its
[1:19:48] complete work on our lives through the
[1:19:50] trying and testing of our faith
[1:19:54] it's all a process
[1:19:55] it's not a miraculous gift of
[1:19:57] instantaneous transformation
[1:20:01] jesus said we'd be known by our fruits
[1:20:04] our actions
[1:20:06] what our lives produce
[1:20:08] jesus also gave us this command
[1:20:11] matthew 5 48 be ye there for perfect
[1:20:16] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:20:19] is perfect
[1:20:20] remember perfect
[1:20:23] and king james often means complete
[1:20:27] when you achieve that that's what this
[1:20:30] is all about to be a temple of his
[1:20:32] spirit
[1:20:33] and another place jesus says john 8 29
[1:20:36] he that sent me is with me
[1:20:38] the father hasn't left me alone
[1:20:41] why
[1:20:42] because i always do those things that
[1:20:46] please him
[1:20:48] he's our example
[1:20:50] we must strive to do the same to be
[1:20:52] found in his will
[1:20:54] doing what pleases him
[1:20:57] accepting correction when we stray
[1:21:00] ongoing
[1:21:02] dying daily to self
[1:21:05] to be like jesus
[1:21:08] what's next
[1:21:11] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:21:13] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:21:16] add brotherly kindness
[1:21:19] this isn't
[1:21:20] just being nice to those who are nice to
[1:21:22] you
[1:21:23] or those who share your views whether
[1:21:25] it's of our faith or or your politics or
[1:21:29] your taste and clothes or the way you
[1:21:31] like your coffee
[1:21:33] brotherly kindness brother branham said
[1:21:35] is to wear the other guy's shoes
[1:21:38] he gave a great illustration of this
[1:21:41] same sermon somebody said not long ago
[1:21:44] talking to brother branham how can you
[1:21:46] believe these things the way you do
[1:21:48] and still go to the assemblies of god
[1:21:50] the oneness and the rest you're going
[1:21:53] and ministering amongst people that
[1:21:55] don't agree with you they don't see
[1:21:56] things the way you do
[1:21:59] then put see brotherly kindness
[1:22:02] see
[1:22:04] see hoping
[1:22:05] someday see patient with him
[1:22:08] see temperate
[1:22:11] enduring with him
[1:22:12] knowledge to understand what he believes
[1:22:15] remember it's in his heart
[1:22:18] that's what is virtue in yourself to let
[1:22:22] it go out with kindness
[1:22:24] meekness to him
[1:22:26] having faith that someday
[1:22:29] god will bring him in
[1:22:31] see
[1:22:33] we should strive to always be reaching
[1:22:36] out in kindness to those who disagree or
[1:22:40] understand things differently
[1:22:42] sincerely not faking it
[1:22:45] not putting it on
[1:22:48] well let's go to the last one
[1:22:52] you've done all these things faith
[1:22:54] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:22:56] godliness brotherly kindness
[1:22:59] charity
[1:23:01] love
[1:23:02] we're all familiar with first
[1:23:04] corinthians 13 the chapter that deals
[1:23:06] with charity
[1:23:08] or love
[1:23:10] i'm not going to read first corinthians
[1:23:12] 13 tonight
[1:23:15] for this capstone this top layer or
[1:23:17] final item of peter's list let's read
[1:23:20] from first john 4.
[1:23:22] it'll be our final scripture selection
[1:23:24] this evening
[1:23:26] and understand that john's not speaking
[1:23:28] of human love one of those greek words
[1:23:30] we seem to be expected to know filio
[1:23:32] versus agapo
[1:23:34] right
[1:23:35] love is a term we see so often in our
[1:23:37] society today but it's so often twisted
[1:23:40] and perverted
[1:23:41] we're not talking about
[1:23:43] rainbows here we're not talking about
[1:23:46] the love in sodom or gay pride that's
[1:23:48] not at all what this is about
[1:23:54] first john 4.
[1:23:57] starting at verse 7
[1:23:59] he says
[1:24:00] beloved let us love one another
[1:24:04] for love is of god
[1:24:07] and everyone that loves
[1:24:09] is born of god
[1:24:12] and knows god
[1:24:14] he that loveth not knoweth not god
[1:24:18] for god is love
[1:24:20] god
[1:24:21] is love
[1:24:23] and this was manifested was shown was
[1:24:26] displayed the love of god toward us
[1:24:30] god showed us his love for us because
[1:24:33] that god sent his only begotten son only
[1:24:35] in this case means uniquely we're also
[1:24:38] sons
[1:24:40] into the world that we might live
[1:24:42] through him
[1:24:44] herein is love
[1:24:46] not that we love god
[1:24:49] but that he loved us
[1:24:51] and sent his son
[1:24:53] to be the propitiation for our sins
[1:24:57] beloved john says
[1:25:00] if god so loved us
[1:25:02] we ought also
[1:25:04] to love one another
[1:25:07] beyond brotherly kindness
[1:25:10] not browbeating because oh love is
[1:25:12] corrective
[1:25:13] but in gentleness
[1:25:14] and meekness
[1:25:16] in love
[1:25:17] serving
[1:25:18] and forgiving one another
[1:25:21] father forgive them
[1:25:23] they know not what they do loving each
[1:25:25] other
[1:25:26] as christ loved us
[1:25:29] no man has seen god at any time
[1:25:32] if we love one another
[1:25:34] god dwells in us
[1:25:36] and his love is perfected it's made
[1:25:38] complete in us
[1:25:41] hereby we know that we dwell in him
[1:25:45] and as temples he in us
[1:25:49] because he's given us
[1:25:52] of his spirit and will bear its fruit
[1:25:56] not manufacturing it but bear it like a
[1:25:59] sheep bears wool
[1:26:01] by this will all men know you're my
[1:26:03] disciples jesus said by your love for
[1:26:05] one another
[1:26:07] john goes on we have seen
[1:26:10] and do testify that the father sent the
[1:26:13] son
[1:26:14] to be the savior of the world
[1:26:17] god came in human flesh to pay the price
[1:26:20] he himself demanded for our forgiveness
[1:26:24] our salvation
[1:26:25] to make it possible for us to escape
[1:26:29] ultimate destruction
[1:26:31] and death
[1:26:32] whosoever shall confess
[1:26:35] that jesus is the son of god
[1:26:38] god dwells in him
[1:26:40] and he and god
[1:26:42] become his tabernacles
[1:26:45] we have known
[1:26:47] and believed
[1:26:48] the love that god hath to us
[1:26:52] god is love he repeats that
[1:26:55] and he that dwelleth in love
[1:26:57] dwelleth in god
[1:26:59] and god in him
[1:27:02] charity
[1:27:03] love
[1:27:05] god is love
[1:27:07] christ himself is the capstone
[1:27:09] we are reminded a change no stronger
[1:27:12] than its weakest link
[1:27:14] reviewing this material tonight is
[1:27:16] important for us to remind us
[1:27:20] brother branham at the end of his sermon
[1:27:22] that we've been abserting from tells us
[1:27:24] why it is important
[1:27:28] he says so this church has got to come
[1:27:30] to perfection to complete this right in
[1:27:34] order to bring the resurrection
[1:27:37] looking for the resurrection we have to
[1:27:39] look to
[1:27:40] ourselves to become
[1:27:42] this body of christ to have these
[1:27:45] attributes in our lives growing to have
[1:27:48] them in abundance as peter said
[1:27:51] we have to come to that state of
[1:27:52] perfection
[1:27:54] completeness
[1:27:55] and maturity
[1:27:57] it takes
[1:27:58] commitment work
[1:28:01] every day
[1:28:03] dying to our flesh that christ might
[1:28:06] live in us
[1:28:07] to each be a holy temple
[1:28:10] in which the holy spirit itself is
[1:28:12] pleased to dwell the musicians would
[1:28:15] please come
[1:28:17] brother branham closed his sermon
[1:28:20] by making a pledge to the lord
[1:28:23] afterward he asked the congregation to
[1:28:26] join him in it this was the pledge that
[1:28:28] he made
[1:28:30] he said
[1:28:31] i pledge this morning to him
[1:28:34] with all my heart
[1:28:36] that by his help
[1:28:38] and by his grace
[1:28:40] i pray that i'll seek daily
[1:28:43] without ceasing
[1:28:45] until i feel every one of these
[1:28:47] requirements
[1:28:48] flowing in this little old stature of
[1:28:50] mine
[1:28:52] till i can be a manifestation
[1:28:54] of the living christ
[1:28:57] for he became sin like me
[1:29:00] that i might become righteousness of god
[1:29:03] like him
[1:29:04] he took my place
[1:29:06] lord let me take his now
[1:29:09] because that's the purpose he died for
[1:29:12] brother branham says
[1:29:14] how many will pledge that same thing
[1:29:18] by the grace of god
[1:29:20] if you join me in prayer for just a
[1:29:22] moment
[1:29:24] lord jesus
[1:29:26] we thank you for the word
[1:29:29] we thank you for the sacrifices that
[1:29:31] have been made to bring us the word so
[1:29:33] many years ago and to carry it through
[1:29:36] 20 centuries that we could
[1:29:39] enjoy its benefits today
[1:29:42] we thank you lord for
[1:29:43] faithful men and women of the gospel of
[1:29:46] jesus christ lord through the ages

[1:29:50] that number lord and we ask again that
[1:29:53] you would forgive us unite us help us

[1:30:10] you and we thank you again

[1:33:14] oh in
[1:33:16] my
[1:33:18] life lord
[1:33:20] big
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:33] in this church

[1:33:41] your
[1:33:42] church
[1:33:44] [Music]

[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:56] lord be glorified
[1:34:00] today my home

[1:34:07] home
[1:34:08] lord
[1:34:10] be glorified
[1:34:13] be glorified
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:26] how many words could we insert
[1:34:28] at our job
[1:34:30] in our neighborhood
[1:34:32] with our family
[1:34:34] wherever we are with our co-workers
[1:34:37] be glorified
[1:34:38] let god be expressed see this is not
[1:34:41] your work this is his work
[1:34:44] the hardest work we have to do is get
[1:34:46] out of the way
[1:34:48] that's our biggest problem
[1:34:50] lord i think i've got it figured out now
[1:34:52] i think god is right
[1:34:53] and i i'll go do it now lord
[1:34:56] but you know what you yield yourself you
[1:34:59] surrender to him you say lord i'm giving
[1:35:01] up and letting you live and then he'll
[1:35:04] put you through the test
[1:35:06] he'll begin to bring those opportunities
[1:35:08] those places to practice what you preach
[1:35:11] what you've heard would you listen and
[1:35:14] then you can live it
[1:35:15] because you're not going to do it in
[1:35:16] your ability
[1:35:19] you're not going to do it under your own
[1:35:21] ability
[1:35:22] it's the spirit of christ
[1:35:24] that puts these things
[1:35:26] peter said lord i'm not going to deny
[1:35:29] you i'm going to go with you all the way
[1:35:32] to the cross i'll never turn my back on
[1:35:34] you oh never nothing nothing
[1:35:38] and they had already told jesus don't
[1:35:40] leave us he said but i must go away
[1:35:43] no no no no he's saying he said no this
[1:35:46] is a better way because if i go i will
[1:35:48] send my spirit back
[1:35:51] to you and thereby
[1:35:53] you can live this
[1:35:55] and peter was put to the test
[1:35:57] immediately
[1:35:59] hey aren't you one of those oh no i
[1:36:01] don't even know he is i don't even know
[1:36:02] his name
[1:36:04] he cursed he did everything he said
[1:36:07] but look at the peter after the day of
[1:36:08] pentecost
[1:36:11] by this very same thing that i denied i
[1:36:13] now preach
[1:36:15] that this is the truth the living god
[1:36:18] and john saw it this way god is love
[1:36:21] god is perfect love
[1:36:23] so when we say lord
[1:36:25] in my life in my home wherever i am
[1:36:28] be glorified
[1:36:30] let christ
[1:36:32] lord we know
[1:36:36] as a minister
[1:36:37] brother lyle myself and others
[1:36:40] you give us something to to minister
[1:36:43] scripture
[1:36:45] through an experience maybe something
[1:36:46] your brother branham say maybe
[1:36:48] something we've recently gone through
[1:36:51] and we share this thing to try to
[1:36:53] encourage to try to show that god is
[1:36:55] more than able
[1:36:58] but just in hearing the word and seeing
[1:37:00] the example lord
[1:37:02] if that's all it it goes to it doesn't
[1:37:05] accomplish anything
[1:37:07] lord but rather it has to come to
[1:37:08] fruition it has to come to life it has
[1:37:10] to be put to test
[1:37:13] lord so again we ask you lord in our
[1:37:16] lives be glorified
[1:37:17] let you your example you jesus christ
[1:37:21] become manifested in us lord
[1:37:23] through every one of these
[1:37:26] from godliness lord all the way up to
[1:37:29] brotherly kindness and then charity and
[1:37:32] he said in that he said we'll call for a
[1:37:34] resurrection
[1:37:36] we'll call for a coming of the lord
[1:37:38] father let it be i pray in jesus
[1:37:40] christ's name
[1:37:42] amen so
[1:37:44] how many would say lord test me try me
[1:37:48] put me to the test there where quickly i
[1:37:50] will know where i'm lacking
[1:37:52] and there where i'm lacking help to show
[1:37:54] me
[1:37:55] what i need to do
[1:37:58] there's a saying that says practice
[1:38:00] makes perfect
[1:38:02] but you got to practice it right to
[1:38:04] become perfect
[1:38:06] you could be practice something wrong
[1:38:08] the whole time
[1:38:10] and it'll never
[1:38:11] but the holy spirit has never missed
[1:38:14] and ever will miss let him work through
[1:38:16] you as our prayer lord
[1:38:18] it there's another song
[1:38:21] but singing it all day and now i'm not

[1:41:30] branham in one of the great the
[1:41:31] testimonies the the humility
[1:41:34] the humbleness
[1:41:36] and that's a person who realizes that
[1:41:38] they're really nothing
[1:41:39] but it's god in them
[1:41:42] and the fact that you could not tell the
[1:41:43] difference between his enemies and his
[1:41:45] friends
[1:41:46] because he treated them all the same
[1:41:49] sometimes we're put to the test and we
[1:41:50] just say lord help us

[1:42:27] and some some goodness and let that have
[1:42:30] an effect to them
