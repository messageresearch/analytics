[45:07] and lord from before the foundation of
[45:09] the world you have seen this day
[45:10] it's nothing is is by chance in you lord
[45:15] but everything is prepared
[45:18] grace within you those those that part
[45:21] of you that had never been expressed
[45:23] lord
[45:24] you were the self-existing one but lord
[45:27] there was one that wanted to manifest
[45:29] himself
[45:31] and you had made provision for that
[45:33] today lord we're the recipients we're
[45:34] the receiver of that grace of god of

[46:00] amen amen i'm glad of his grace and his
[46:04] mercy while you're standing let's read
[46:06] one scripture thank you
[46:07] musicians in first corinthians
[46:13] chapter 8 verse 6
[46:17] and i'm praying that the lord will get
[46:20] my thoughts organized here because
[46:23] sometimes you come up with a hundred
[46:25] things you're not too sure which where
[46:26] to go but
[46:28] first corinthians 8 6
[46:33] but to us there is but one god the
[46:36] father
[46:37] of whom are all things and we
[46:41] in him and one lord jesus christ
[46:44] by whom are all things and we by him
[46:48] so amen god bless you may be seated
[46:54] i uh
[46:58] i've been something that started maybe
[47:03] eight ten years ago
[47:06] when i began to first minister and
[47:08] brother green had spoke to me and
[47:11] shared with me his burden how he felt
[47:13] and and asked me if i
[47:16] if i would want to minister if i had the
[47:18] desire and i said well you know just
[47:20] we've been looking at it and so we did
[47:23] minister and then but
[47:24] something had been in my heart for a
[47:25] long time and had mentioned it to
[47:27] brother green i said i would like to get
[47:29] into that
[47:30] that message things that are to be
[47:34] and maybe speak on that and he said
[47:36] brother aaron that would be wonderful
[47:38] well it didn't happen for 10 years
[47:42] and lord knows why and and so a couple
[47:44] weeks ago
[47:45] was just studying through the rapture
[47:47] message and the following message is
[47:48] things that are to be
[47:51] and i said lord maybe it's time now
[47:54] but i don't know there's so much in
[47:58] there
[47:59] where do you start you know but i just
[48:02] i've asked the lord that maybe we could
[48:04] go in that direction and
[48:06] show as i was preparing this would have
[48:08] been monday evening
[48:11] had listened to what brother matt had
[48:13] spoken sunday morning
[48:15] and speaking of of a being in a place
[48:19] not so much the physical location of
[48:22] eden
[48:23] but the atmosphere of eden and i had god
[48:27] questioned
[48:28] did brother matt say that eden didn't
[48:30] exist that it was no
[48:31] that's not what he was saying there is a
[48:33] place the scripture gives us the
[48:35] boundaries in the place of it
[48:37] but he's talking what made eden was the
[48:39] presence of god what was going on there
[48:41] you know and so i thought lord well then
[48:45] that just ties right into what i and
[48:48] then brother lyle speaking on
[48:50] sunday night and
[48:54] i'm going to share something with you
[48:57] speaking with brother matt yesterday and
[49:00] and he goes man brother lyle has a
[49:02] scientific mind
[49:04] i said yes you should hear him and
[49:06] brother mike yarbrough together
[49:10] so brother mike and brother lyle were
[49:12] standing out here one day
[49:13] in the in the fellowship hall and i was
[49:16] listening to them but not understanding
[49:18] a whole lot
[49:20] so i walked up to them and i don't think
[49:22] they were expecting this at all
[49:25] and i said you know you two brothers i
[49:27] could not recommend your brains to
[49:29] anybody
[49:31] and that stopped them quite quickly i
[49:34] said but mine
[49:35] mine would sell for a very valuable
[49:37] price
[49:40] and they're both especially brother mike
[49:42] gave me a really good look he said i
[49:43] don't understand what you're trying to
[49:44] tell us i said look at yours
[49:46] millions and millions of miles used
[49:49] they've been used up and down back and
[49:51] forth mine is like brand new hardly even
[49:53] touched
[49:55] brother mike says go on get out of here
[50:00] but to god gives to each one
[50:04] in each life and the things that god has
[50:07] for a reason
[50:08] for a purpose and in speaking with
[50:11] brother matt and
[50:12] and i know he's listening because he
[50:13] sent me a text i'm praying for you
[50:15] brother aaron
[50:16] and i said he said i listen to brother
[50:19] lyle sunday evening he goes and that was
[50:21] amazing
[50:22] so i listened to it again on youtube on
[50:25] monday and he goes and he was it was
[50:26] even more amazing
[50:28] but he did say something and i think i
[50:30] think brother lyle would agree with this
[50:31] we're not trying to prove god by science
[50:35] not at all because i know what brother
[50:36] lyle spoke to me with me
[50:38] before but isn't it amazing that god
[50:40] leaves evidences everywhere of his work
[50:44] because he he does these things so and
[50:47] and the quote that caught my attention
[50:49] and
[50:50] and and i'm going to go ahead and read
[50:52] that one first brother
[50:54] jeremy even though it was the last one
[50:57] that i give you from things that are to
[51:00] be
[51:02] and and this was one of the as i was
[51:03] studying this is one of the last places
[51:05] i got to
[51:07] and it really stood out to me how how it
[51:10] fitted to you in this life as you grew
[51:13] everything fitted right in because you
[51:15] were made for that
[51:17] he says wasn't it a strange thing the
[51:20] night that you staggered into the
[51:21] mission the tent meeting or the little
[51:22] church somewhere on the corner
[51:24] and something the preacher preached on a
[51:26] certain subject and you just fell right
[51:28] at the altar
[51:29] see see god knew that before the
[51:32] foundation of the world see
[51:34] it seems strange to you why you did it
[51:37] then but now you understand
[51:39] you knew what happened it's so fitting
[51:41] that to you in
[51:42] in this life and it will also be also
[51:46] in the life that is to come and he says
[51:49] the world
[51:50] and its life seems to to advance as you
[51:52] mature
[51:53] everything seems to go right with you
[51:56] sometimes you wonder if it is but god
[51:58] has it all
[51:59] if if you had planned your own life
[52:02] people said i think this is going to be
[52:03] right this is going to be right
[52:04] who knows where you would have ended up
[52:07] but because god laid it out
[52:08] everything is right for you he says
[52:12] he says i don't believe that that a
[52:16] person just happened to be here by
[52:18] chance
[52:19] now just think when you come to the
[52:22] world everything had to be
[52:24] for prepared for you or pre-prepared
[52:26] rather
[52:27] for you then he said this is what caught
[52:29] me i don't hardly understand that how
[52:31] that we could think that a god
[52:33] that could prepare all these good things
[52:36] for us
[52:36] would not or we could not put trust in
[52:39] him
[52:40] that if he brought us in this chaos that
[52:42] we're in now
[52:43] and prepared the good things of life for
[52:45] us here how much more can we trust him
[52:48] to prepare the things that is to come
[52:51] see
[52:52] the eternal things and that's that's the
[52:54] statement at
[52:56] as far as i had been reading and
[52:57] studying that really caught my attention
[53:00] if he's brought us this far and he's
[53:02] prepared it all and he's never missed
[53:04] then how much more that because that was
[53:07] his intention
[53:09] it wasn't the life on this earth but to
[53:11] be restored back
[53:12] to the garden of eden that that
[53:14] atmosphere that he created there so
[53:18] and i just appreciate it then we'll go
[53:20] ahead back
[53:21] go to the first one there brother jeremy
[53:25] he says from to whom would we go he said
[53:29] when it's going to be i don't know but
[53:32] it may be before morning
[53:34] it may be in the next hour it may be in
[53:36] the next five minutes
[53:37] whatever it is it's near at hand
[53:40] there's nothing else to happen but the
[53:42] coming of the lord jesus
[53:44] the church is rallying itself getting
[53:46] itself together
[53:47] shaking itself did you ever see such a
[53:49] stirring amongst the people
[53:51] sure something's fixing to happen the
[53:54] coming of the lord
[53:55] the whole earth is waiting for the
[53:57] manifestations
[53:59] the manifestations of the sons of god
[54:01] the nature out yonder which man
[54:03] has given dominion so you and i have a
[54:07] part
[54:07] you and i have a place something to do
[54:09] is we're not we're not puppets on a
[54:11] string that god is manipulating
[54:13] you say well if he pre-planned it he
[54:15] must be work no
[54:17] he knows the end from the beginning he's
[54:20] laid it out
[54:20] but you and i have a place and a part to
[54:22] do here
[54:24] and and when you see see a fallen earth
[54:27] a decaying earth
[54:28] you should understand it's waiting on me
[54:32] it's waiting for the manifestations of
[54:34] the sons of god to come back to that
[54:35] place
[54:36] that we were at let's go to the next
[54:40] quote
[54:40] here adoption
[54:44] i think it is
[54:50] when when was our names put in the
[54:52] lamb's book of life
[54:54] when the lamb was slain from before the
[54:56] foundation of the world
[54:58] when god was jehovah el ella elohim the
[55:01] self-existent
[55:02] one just like one great big diamond
[55:06] and he could not be nothing else but
[55:08] inside of this diamond his attributes
[55:10] was a savior
[55:11] in his attributes on the inside of him
[55:14] was a healer
[55:15] well there was nothing to save and
[55:17] nothing to heal but his
[55:18] attributes produced it so then before
[55:22] the foundation of the world when he
[55:23] knowed
[55:24] that the great display in here of him
[55:26] that he would be a savior that he would
[55:28] come
[55:29] and be made flesh and dwelt amongst us
[55:33] and when he knowed by his stripes we
[55:35] would be healed he slayed the lamb
[55:37] on his book before the foundation of the
[55:40] world and
[55:41] wrote your name on the book before the
[55:43] foundation of the world
[55:46] so you might go against it but he
[55:48] already seen you there
[55:50] and sometimes they just say i surrender
[55:52] lord
[55:54] and and i i had a testimony my
[55:56] sister-in-law is here
[55:58] elizabeth i almost referred to her as
[56:01] misty because that's how we know her
[56:03] but you know we had put in a prayer
[56:06] request
[56:07] um for her because of a job change
[56:12] and she was wondering now do i what do i
[56:14] do and what do i go and she said it was
[56:16] just
[56:16] it was nervous and and things going and
[56:18] she was asking the lord what did i do
[56:21] and she heard a voice speak to her and
[56:22] just said this world is not your home
[56:27] does god still speak that way he still
[56:30] he can he can give you a sign he can
[56:32] give but he can also speak to you if you
[56:34] listen to him
[56:35] if you'll be willing to to listen
[56:37] sometimes we get busy we get going we
[56:39] get
[56:39] we get doing a lot of things but
[56:41] sometimes in that quiet time if you'll
[56:43] stop and say lord
[56:44] speak to me and make yourself she said
[56:47] the peace that came with it
[56:49] settled everything when he says this is
[56:52] not your place
[56:53] this is not your home but while you're
[56:56] here
[56:56] something's going to happen something's
[56:58] going to take place so
[56:59] he said
[57:03] and then let's go on to the last one i
[57:05] believe we had one more
[57:06] quote there nothing existed before him
[57:13] he was the the all the existence that
[57:15] there ever was
[57:17] i can't imagine that because all we've
[57:20] ever known is this world
[57:22] but before that he was the only thing
[57:23] that existed
[57:25] okay one el elohim
[57:29] beanzee all sufficient all-powerful
[57:31] almighty self-existence one oh
[57:34] but in genesis 2 when he made man he
[57:36] said i am
[57:38] j u y-a-h-u-j-u-v u h j v h u jehovah
[57:43] what did it mean i am the all existence
[57:46] one who has created something off of
[57:48] myself
[57:49] to be a son of mine or a temporary or
[57:53] amateur little one of mine
[57:55] and he says glory why he gave man
[57:57] jehovah means that he gave man
[57:59] to be an amateur god because he
[58:02] is father god and he made a man an
[58:04] amateur god
[58:05] so he isn't self-existent anymore
[58:08] he exists with his family allah elohim
[58:12] now
[58:13] now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the
[58:15] one who exists with his family
[58:17] god now god made man to be predominant
[58:20] over all the earth
[58:21] he had dominion and the earth was man's
[58:23] dominion
[58:24] is that scripture then if that's his
[58:26] domain he was god over the earth he
[58:28] could speak
[58:29] and it would be so he could speak this
[58:31] and it would be so oh
[58:33] there he is god jehovah the one who once
[58:37] existed in self-existence but now exists
[58:39] with his family
[58:41] and his little ones with him there you
[58:43] are
[58:45] how many says i am amen there i am i'm
[58:48] so glad i'm part of that family so
[58:51] so as we were looking into some of these
[58:54] things and
[58:55] and um
[59:00] i was getting ready monday evening and
[59:03] and uh to start
[59:05] taking these thoughts and trying to put
[59:06] them on paper and and get them
[59:10] and someone had forwarded a a video to
[59:13] my wife
[59:14] and she forwarded it to me and it was
[59:16] about a quarter to seven and i just
[59:18] opened it up to look at it see what it
[59:20] was and
[59:21] i began to watch it and listen to this
[59:23] man as he was explaining some things and
[59:26] my wife came in she sat down and she
[59:28] goes isn't it just amazing i go yeah but
[59:30] i need to turn it off because i need to
[59:32] study so an hour later when it finished
[59:37] i was like wow this just put a lot of
[59:40] things in a different perspective
[59:43] so i want to share a little bit of that
[59:44] with you and and i know that
[59:47] we're not going to get very far along
[59:49] and things that are to be but just kind
[59:50] of laying a base
[59:52] and when realized that god has had it
[59:54] all in in his hands under control has
[59:56] never gotten out of control i heard
[59:58] today or i read today that california
[1:00:00] has said
[1:00:01] um no more gatherings allowed in
[1:00:04] churches
[1:00:05] interior being inside i guess that meant
[1:00:08] they could gather outside but no more
[1:00:10] than i thought
[1:00:10] in a time when people should be on their
[1:00:12] knees seeking god
[1:00:14] they're telling them no now go to church
[1:00:18] when it should be the other one we
[1:00:19] should be on our faith seeking the lord
[1:00:21] jesus
[1:00:22] and it's turned around but brother brahm
[1:00:25] talks about he's the god of this evil
[1:00:26] age
[1:00:28] he has served the authority he it was
[1:00:30] stripped from man
[1:00:33] you know but at the same time go back
[1:00:34] and look at job
[1:00:36] when he wanted to tempt job you know who
[1:00:38] he had to get permission from
[1:00:40] from your father he had to go is it okay
[1:00:44] and god said yes because i have
[1:00:46] confidence in my son
[1:00:48] so i want to share a few things with you
[1:00:51] and
[1:00:52] brother lyle in no way am i taking
[1:00:54] anything that you said in trying to
[1:00:56] make myself anywhere near that because i
[1:00:59] had to call brother peter up and ask him
[1:01:01] if i was understanding some of these
[1:01:03] things i said i mentioned once i passed
[1:01:07] science because i sat next to a very
[1:01:10] intelligent young man who was my
[1:01:11] neighbor
[1:01:12] and he helped me out quite a bit so but
[1:01:15] let's just start with this it's a little
[1:01:17] humorous but just to think about it
[1:01:19] a fellow sat under a tree once and
[1:01:21] pretending to be
[1:01:23] a master of structural engineering
[1:01:25] skills he said you know god
[1:01:27] i don't think you are very smart he says
[1:01:30] when i
[1:01:30] think of the way you made this world a
[1:01:33] huge
[1:01:34] tree holding little nuts and a small
[1:01:36] plant holding huge watermelons
[1:01:39] he says it just doesn't make sense a big
[1:01:42] tree
[1:01:43] small nuts a small plant huge
[1:01:44] watermelons
[1:01:46] as he waxed eloquent against god's
[1:01:48] inability to do something
[1:01:50] reasonably suddenly a little nut fell
[1:01:53] and hit him on the head
[1:01:56] and he cried out thank god that wasn't a
[1:01:58] watermelon tree
[1:02:02] you know and and they caught this this
[1:02:04] was a story and this the comment the mad
[1:02:06] the man made to this it's a simple way
[1:02:08] to understand
[1:02:10] why we sometimes educate ourselves
[1:02:13] to absurdity
[1:02:16] in man's best in man's wanting
[1:02:20] to create a place to live
[1:02:23] where everything is perfect what is he
[1:02:25] created
[1:02:28] but god had it all laid out and
[1:02:31] this this portion was called the first
[1:02:33] three minutes of the universe and maybe
[1:02:34] some of you have
[1:02:35] read this or heard this before but it's
[1:02:37] first time i saw it
[1:02:40] and this is taken in the thought of
[1:02:43] when the universe started and and the
[1:02:45] man that gives this thing is not talking
[1:02:48] about
[1:02:49] a big a big chance he's talking about
[1:02:52] going back far enough they can see
[1:02:53] somewhere someplace where this started
[1:02:55] how precise it had to be
[1:02:57] how it could have missed so let me just
[1:02:58] read this to you when you realize how
[1:03:00] exact to every minute
[1:03:02] my new details this world had to be
[1:03:06] not talking about minutes seconds we're
[1:03:08] talking about micro
[1:03:10] seconds and this is what i asked brother
[1:03:12] peter here
[1:03:14] like 10 to the power of negative 36.
[1:03:18] so i've heard 10 to the power but i've
[1:03:21] never heard it referred to the negative
[1:03:23] side and so i said what does that mean
[1:03:24] he said brother
[1:03:25] peter said you take 0
[1:03:28] and you go back 35 zeros and then
[1:03:31] there's that point one
[1:03:34] that's that's next to nothing
[1:03:38] he says he says if you
[1:03:41] change the decimal point of this
[1:03:44] exactness by even one
[1:03:46] you would foul up the whole process
[1:03:49] he says this is how fine-tuned this
[1:03:52] needed to be
[1:03:53] the expansion and contraction precision
[1:03:56] of the universe
[1:03:57] in the early moments had to be so exact
[1:04:00] to the micro
[1:04:01] second category the margin of error
[1:04:04] so small that it would be like taking
[1:04:07] aim at a one square
[1:04:09] inch object at the other end of the
[1:04:12] universe
[1:04:12] 20 billion light years away
[1:04:16] it and hitting it bullseye
[1:04:19] and then he said oh and it just happened
[1:04:24] god has his hand in everything
[1:04:28] he created it he put it together he he
[1:04:30] he
[1:04:31] made the laws and formed it at all and
[1:04:33] it happens that way
[1:04:35] and speaking with brother brother lyle
[1:04:37] and we've
[1:04:39] to talk many times it's because god set
[1:04:41] these laws up
[1:04:43] not because man is so smart that he
[1:04:46] found him but because god set them there
[1:04:47] and then
[1:04:49] sometimes man stumbles on to them you
[1:04:51] know because nobody is walking around
[1:04:53] saying i know where that is
[1:04:55] they've worked and worked and worked and
[1:04:56] worked to get to that place
[1:04:59] and and so and this one here is
[1:05:03] a picture a slight picture of nasa shows
[1:05:06] 100 billion
[1:05:08] stars if you counted
[1:05:11] one per second you would be counting for
[1:05:14] 2500 years
[1:05:17] so genesis 1 16 says this
[1:05:23] and god made two great lights the
[1:05:26] greater light
[1:05:27] to rule the day and the lesser light to
[1:05:29] rule the night
[1:05:30] he made the stars also
[1:05:35] that simple he made the stars also
[1:05:38] so our hands our future our all is in
[1:05:41] this creator's hands the one who has it
[1:05:45] all under control
[1:05:47] and there's nothing too big for him
[1:05:50] nothing too small for him and it remind
[1:05:53] me of this song and
[1:05:55] and i i said it to you or i quote the
[1:05:57] words here
[1:05:58] how big is god how big and wide his vast
[1:06:02] domain
[1:06:02] to try to tell my lips can only start
[1:06:07] he's big enough to rule this mighty
[1:06:09] universe
[1:06:10] yet small enough to live within my heart
[1:06:15] and i think that he could make himself
[1:06:17] small enough to become human
[1:06:19] to walk in flesh to feel pain
[1:06:22] to hurt so that he could understand
[1:06:27] and it's just things that like i said i
[1:06:29] was i was
[1:06:30] reading and listening to to some of the
[1:06:32] things this man said and going and i was
[1:06:34] like good lord
[1:06:37] it we can't even begin to understand you
[1:06:39] lord
[1:06:40] but you never just said understand me
[1:06:42] you just said accept me and believe me
[1:06:45] accept what i've done for you you know
[1:06:48] our sister elizabeth
[1:06:49] she just asked the lord you know what do
[1:06:51] i do
[1:06:53] and he answered it simply he said this
[1:06:55] world's not your home
[1:06:57] you've got something ahead of you that's
[1:06:59] a greater than this so
[1:07:01] god brings peace and all let's look at
[1:07:04] luke
[1:07:05] saint john 1 or saint john 14 1 1-3
[1:07:09] this is a scripture that brother branham
[1:07:11] uses to
[1:07:14] to to begin this things that are to be
[1:07:16] let not your heart be troubled
[1:07:20] to me it's not it's a commandment yet
[1:07:22] it's a promise
[1:07:23] it's not a uh you must do this it's god
[1:07:27] setting just telling you let
[1:07:28] your heart be in trouble this world is
[1:07:30] not your home
[1:07:32] sometimes we we look at a let not or
[1:07:34] don't do this we look at it as a law
[1:07:36] but god is just telling don't don't let
[1:07:39] it trouble you
[1:07:40] don't let it get it let not your heart
[1:07:42] be trouble ye believe in god
[1:07:44] believe also in me in my father's house
[1:07:47] are many mansions if it were not so i
[1:07:49] would have told you
[1:07:50] i go to prepare a place for you and if i
[1:07:54] go
[1:07:54] and did he go so the rest of the
[1:07:57] scripture
[1:07:58] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[1:08:00] i will come again
[1:08:02] and receive you unto myself that where i
[1:08:04] am
[1:08:05] there ye may be also something else that
[1:08:09] happened this week
[1:08:11] and the brother may be listening i don't
[1:08:13] know if he does
[1:08:15] but he's he he had wanted to get ahold
[1:08:17] of brother matt and and brother matt has
[1:08:19] told me if
[1:08:20] somebody wants to talk to brother matt
[1:08:22] and you know and he comes to me
[1:08:24] he says go ahead and give him my phone
[1:08:25] number so i did
[1:08:28] but brother matt had given me his um
[1:08:32] work number and i had given this brother
[1:08:34] his work number which brother matt had
[1:08:36] no longer used so the brother couldn't
[1:08:38] get to him
[1:08:40] so he sent me he said i've been trying
[1:08:42] to get ahold of brother matt this and
[1:08:43] this
[1:08:44] so let me just tell you and he gave me
[1:08:46] about two pages
[1:08:47] of where we are as a bride today
[1:08:52] and he said they're waiting for a
[1:08:53] rapture but there is no rapture
[1:08:55] they're waiting for a body change but
[1:08:57] there is no body change
[1:09:00] i'm reading this and i'm going well what
[1:09:03] hope do you have then and he says
[1:09:06] brother branham raised up in the um with
[1:09:09] the seven angels that was his rapture
[1:09:12] so ours and he began and i'm thinking
[1:09:16] uh he's not a young man he's going
[1:09:19] through a lot of physical
[1:09:20] problems right now and say you have no
[1:09:23] hope for a body change
[1:09:25] and then he made another comment and he
[1:09:27] said brother so and so he's been
[1:09:28] preaching
[1:09:29] he's just about got it just exactly like
[1:09:31] i've got it
[1:09:33] but he's waiting on a body change
[1:09:37] i'm waiting on a body change
[1:09:40] i don't want to take this one over there
[1:09:43] this one did something thought he could
[1:09:47] do what he could do
[1:09:48] 30 years ago yesterday
[1:09:51] my wife we bought some plants she bought
[1:09:54] 14 plants to
[1:09:55] put around the yard and and
[1:09:58] i know what that means it means i'm
[1:10:00] going to be working
[1:10:02] so i said well i'll get out there and
[1:10:03] i'll get started i'll start digging out
[1:10:05] and
[1:10:06] i've never been one who can just dig one
[1:10:08] hole one day in another hole the next
[1:10:09] day it seems like i've got to do them
[1:10:11] all so i got home relatively early
[1:10:12] yesterday about one o'clock in the
[1:10:14] afternoon
[1:10:15] so between 1 30 and 2 00 o'clock in the
[1:10:16] cool of the afternoon
[1:10:18] i went out and started digging well it
[1:10:21] was cool somewhere i'm sure
[1:10:23] and i started digging and um you know
[1:10:25] had to go down about
[1:10:26] 16 inches and then go about two feet
[1:10:28] around and
[1:10:30] the people that had lived there before
[1:10:32] they had put
[1:10:34] tarps underneath to protect keep the
[1:10:35] weeds from coming out and i started
[1:10:37] hitting them about this deep
[1:10:38] so i had her i said call and see if i
[1:10:40] need to remove that do i got to cut
[1:10:42] around it or just the hole and they said
[1:10:43] oh no
[1:10:44] cut back about two feet around or it's
[1:10:46] gonna it's gonna
[1:10:47] inhibit the the moisture getting down to
[1:10:49] things so
[1:10:51] turned out to be about a three and a
[1:10:52] half four hour project
[1:10:54] in the in the cold summer afternoon
[1:10:57] um my wife went out there and she kept
[1:10:59] saying come on in that's enough that's
[1:11:01] enough i said no
[1:11:02] i'm almost done i'm almost done i'm
[1:11:04] almost done
[1:11:06] and so we worked on it and got it all
[1:11:08] done about
[1:11:10] three and a half four hours later i was
[1:11:12] feeling a little lightheaded a little
[1:11:13] worn out
[1:11:14] the joints were all aching the knees
[1:11:16] didn't want to walk anymore but
[1:11:18] i kept telling myself you can do it
[1:11:21] and the smarter one kept saying no you
[1:11:23] can't
[1:11:25] come come on inside now so i went inside
[1:11:28] i'm feeling a little woozy and i checked
[1:11:29] my blood pressure and it was like 85
[1:11:31] over 45.
[1:11:33] and that's pretty low for me and
[1:11:34] probably pretty low for everybody and
[1:11:36] she says i told you to take care of
[1:11:38] yourself
[1:11:40] i tell you i'm looking for a body change
[1:11:44] one other thing that i've done and my
[1:11:45] boss kind of
[1:11:47] i i went back to the shop because i
[1:11:49] thought for sure i left my
[1:11:51] ladder in the shop and it wasn't there
[1:11:52] so i left it on a job site somewhere
[1:11:55] and my boss goes my you lose ladders as
[1:11:58] fast as i use measuring tapes and i go
[1:12:00] yeah but measuring tape is a lot less
[1:12:02] expensive
[1:12:04] so i think since i've been working i've
[1:12:05] left three ladders somewhere and
[1:12:07] somebody's got them i'm waiting for a
[1:12:10] body change
[1:12:12] maybe a little selfish you'd say but no
[1:12:15] this world is not my home
[1:12:17] i'm just a passing through don't get
[1:12:19] your route set down so deep
[1:12:21] that it's hard to get out lord enough
[1:12:25] i'm ready to go home so he said and i've
[1:12:28] prepared
[1:12:29] a place for you and and
[1:12:33] i appreciate his grace and his mercy for
[1:12:35] that you know
[1:12:36] he said in my father's house are many
[1:12:38] manchester
[1:12:39] if it were not so i would tell you
[1:12:43] and i go to prepare a place for you
[1:12:46] and if i go to prepare for a place for
[1:12:48] you
[1:12:49] i will come again and will receive you
[1:12:52] unto myself
[1:12:53] that where i am there ye may be also
[1:12:58] it's his desire was for you to be
[1:13:01] with him because he already
[1:13:05] existed alone
[1:13:09] he doesn't want to continue existing
[1:13:11] alone he wants to be
[1:13:13] with his children with his his bride
[1:13:16] with his family
[1:13:18] and if you have representation now
[1:13:20] something calling something drawing you
[1:13:23] saying yeah that's me then you want to
[1:13:26] be there too
[1:13:28] you know and it's just not so much just
[1:13:30] to get out of this world
[1:13:32] sometimes we're praying lord i just want
[1:13:34] out of here
[1:13:35] but it's not the right motive
[1:13:38] brother branham reminds me many times
[1:13:40] when brother brahms talking about the
[1:13:42] spirit of
[1:13:42] a true attitude of a christian is
[1:13:46] lord is there more that i could take
[1:13:47] with me
[1:13:49] abraham is the one that i always go back
[1:13:52] to when when
[1:13:53] god came down and and sat down with him
[1:13:55] and told him what he was going to do
[1:13:57] down in sodom
[1:14:00] how many of you if god would brother
[1:14:01] brother if god would sit down with you
[1:14:03] this evening and tell you what he's
[1:14:04] planning to do
[1:14:06] and and the end of the destruction of
[1:14:08] the world would tell you well lord let's
[1:14:10] get it done today so i can go home
[1:14:14] but something in your heart would say
[1:14:15] lord is is there a possibility through
[1:14:17] some grace for some of these other folks
[1:14:20] the same grace that you had on me the
[1:14:22] same desire that you had for me
[1:14:24] could i give it to somebody else
[1:14:29] and that should be our heart lord as you
[1:14:31] had mercy on me
[1:14:33] as you had grace for me as as you met my
[1:14:36] knees
[1:14:36] could you meet someone else's could
[1:14:38] could we share this with someone else
[1:14:40] and i always think about that abraham
[1:14:42] saying lord if there was
[1:14:43] 50 would you destroy i think adam
[1:14:46] i mean abraham knew there wasn't 50
[1:14:48] there
[1:14:50] i think abraham knew there was just
[1:14:52] going to be one family left when all
[1:14:54] this was done but he still was looking
[1:14:55] to see if there is that possibility
[1:14:59] lord that my neighbor that my co-worker
[1:15:03] that my brother my sister would come to
[1:15:05] this
[1:15:06] same place that i've gotten to know you
[1:15:08] same same experiences with you
[1:15:11] matthew 11 25
[1:15:16] and and we don't gloat over this but i'm
[1:15:19] grateful for this
[1:15:20] at that time jesus answered and said i
[1:15:22] thank the o father
[1:15:24] lord of heaven and earth because thou
[1:15:26] has hid these things from the wise and
[1:15:28] the putin
[1:15:29] but has revealed them unto babes
[1:15:33] and and you know when i was reading some
[1:15:35] of this i'm thinking lord
[1:15:38] you know i'm understanding it because
[1:15:40] the man that wrote it up wrote it out
[1:15:41] understandably but if you'd written it
[1:15:43] all in equations
[1:15:45] it might as well be another language
[1:15:48] to someone that has studied that
[1:15:50] language fine
[1:15:52] but to me but god says you know what i
[1:15:55] can make it simple
[1:15:56] i can make it to your level i can go all
[1:15:59] the way down to the ground
[1:16:00] aaron if i have to get down to your
[1:16:02] level i said thank you lord
[1:16:03] and i appreciate that you have hidden
[1:16:06] this
[1:16:07] from the wise and the prudent but
[1:16:10] those that would be willing to learn and
[1:16:12] say lord teach me
[1:16:14] lord let my heart be sweet and humble
[1:16:16] with a a learning attitude he says
[1:16:19] you know and i i seem to miss it be
[1:16:23] missing one page here
[1:16:24] maybe i jump past it hold on there
[1:16:29] sometimes you write the notes down and
[1:16:32] then
[1:16:34] here they are
[1:16:41] so just just talking about attitude and
[1:16:44] looking at this and
[1:16:45] like i say this is a long ways around to
[1:16:48] get to the subject of
[1:16:50] things that are to be but by looking at
[1:16:52] what he's done for us today we have a
[1:16:54] good idea
[1:16:55] what the other side is going to be he
[1:16:56] says this was an interesting thing he
[1:16:59] said a politician was campaigning for
[1:17:01] the rights of the underprivileged
[1:17:04] and a young underprivileged man came to
[1:17:06] see him at his office
[1:17:07] a politician secretary went to the
[1:17:10] politician told him that there was a
[1:17:11] young man at the door
[1:17:12] who wanted to see him the politician
[1:17:16] answered since i have begun to fight for
[1:17:17] his cause
[1:17:19] i have no more time for i have no time
[1:17:21] for individuals
[1:17:22] anymore she said incredible sir
[1:17:27] even god hasn't reached that stage yet
[1:17:32] that was really caught my attention
[1:17:34] you're fighting for more rigid influence
[1:17:36] but i don't have time for you
[1:17:40] what i'm doing is too big and her answer
[1:17:43] was
[1:17:44] my god hasn't even reached that stage
[1:17:47] yet
[1:17:48] he can go down while he's bringing all
[1:17:50] of this
[1:17:51] to its climax and he'll go down and call
[1:17:54] you by name
[1:17:54] and talk to you and minister to you
[1:17:58] you know i shared this testimony i was
[1:17:59] talking a little bit the other day with
[1:18:01] my dad about it when
[1:18:02] we down in there in mexico when they had
[1:18:04] the
[1:18:05] the service there where the the
[1:18:06] fellowship meetings there down
[1:18:08] there at the church where we helped um
[1:18:11] tabernacle help
[1:18:13] put it together and the sister was was
[1:18:15] preoccupied
[1:18:16] the pastor's wife because she knew a lot
[1:18:19] of people were coming
[1:18:20] and and they're they're not people that
[1:18:22] can come and pay their own hotel
[1:18:23] expenses and
[1:18:24] they're poor people if in fact there
[1:18:26] were the churches
[1:18:28] um they built they have property they
[1:18:31] call them a he those would be just
[1:18:33] little properties given to them and the
[1:18:34] people are allowed to
[1:18:36] to build a little home and after x
[1:18:38] amount of time it becomes your
[1:18:40] your home why kind of because you live
[1:18:42] there now
[1:18:43] and it had light bulbs it had light
[1:18:45] switches that had everything in the
[1:18:46] house
[1:18:47] close by there but no power
[1:18:50] but the power was right down the street
[1:18:53] and had been there for seven hours for
[1:18:54] seven years he the brother told us
[1:18:56] just hadn't been connected yet
[1:19:00] you know a poor people
[1:19:04] in a very similar land that we are some
[1:19:08] temperature and all
[1:19:09] a lot of agriculture nobody had bought
[1:19:12] hay to feed their horses and cows if
[1:19:14] there was no grazing no rain their cows
[1:19:16] and their horses died
[1:19:18] they were poor people mom and dad took
[1:19:21] some clothes mom
[1:19:22] traveled with dad on this trip and they
[1:19:24] took some clothes and stuff down before
[1:19:26] they
[1:19:26] they stopped letting you cross and
[1:19:29] so he got got some information as to
[1:19:32] where to take it and they told him go up
[1:19:33] this dirt road back up on the hill up
[1:19:35] there and um
[1:19:36] and there's some folks that could really
[1:19:38] use the help so they drove up there and
[1:19:41] began to give this family they were they
[1:19:43] were a christian family and began to
[1:19:44] give them some things and
[1:19:47] my mom said it made her cry to see the
[1:19:50] the stage
[1:19:51] what these people lived in you know and
[1:19:53] he said
[1:19:54] you know got some shoes for the kids and
[1:19:55] some clothes on it and then the family
[1:19:58] stopped them and they said okay that's
[1:19:59] enough for us because the poor people
[1:20:01] live further up the hill
[1:20:04] my mom said i was already crying to see
[1:20:06] how how
[1:20:08] hard they had and they said no the poor
[1:20:10] people live up the hill up there
[1:20:15] i'm glad god looks at us all the same
[1:20:19] and not based on our stature not based
[1:20:21] on what we have what we can do
[1:20:23] but what he's done for us
[1:20:27] you know just when when this this she
[1:20:31] told incredible sir
[1:20:32] even god hasn't reached that stage yet
[1:20:36] but they're they're in in the place
[1:20:37] where where the
[1:20:39] where they were going to have the food
[1:20:40] at the church and all the sister sister
[1:20:42] santoshi
[1:20:43] or brother santos wife she she
[1:20:47] she came up she said told my dad she
[1:20:49] said i don't know what to do i don't
[1:20:50] know how we're going to feed everybody
[1:20:52] so my dad said let's go to the grocery
[1:20:54] store and let's buy what you need
[1:20:56] so they went and they're used to buying
[1:20:59] two eggs
[1:21:01] this that's all they can afford two
[1:21:03] slices of bread enough for the next day
[1:21:05] that's generally all they could
[1:21:06] he said no just take everything what you
[1:21:08] think when these they took it all
[1:21:10] so they made a big pot of soup that's
[1:21:13] usually what goes
[1:21:15] and goes best on and she came up to him
[1:21:17] several hours crying
[1:21:19] she said brother we've been serving
[1:21:21] people from the soup
[1:21:22] all day and it's still full
[1:21:26] he's a god that does those type of
[1:21:28] things he takes care of all of that
[1:21:30] he can take one into a million as
[1:21:32] quickly as i can make a million into one
[1:21:36] he's good yes see he left the 90 and 9.
[1:21:42] for one he wasn't too busy
[1:21:45] for that one for sister elizabeth there
[1:21:49] in the room when he said what do i do
[1:21:50] now
[1:21:51] this world is not your home he's not too
[1:21:54] busy for that
[1:21:57] and you know it's it's it's a thought
[1:22:00] here
[1:22:00] god sees the agony the hurts the the
[1:22:03] things that each person is going through
[1:22:05] individually sure you could say he looks
[1:22:08] at us as
[1:22:09] tucson tabernacle that's what again but
[1:22:12] you're an individual to him
[1:22:14] you know he knows who you are he knows
[1:22:16] you by name he knows what you have need
[1:22:18] of he knows
[1:22:19] and he looks at the the matters of your
[1:22:21] heart
[1:22:23] and and you know i might try to
[1:22:25] understand i i maybe
[1:22:27] could could have a good word for you but
[1:22:29] he will never miss
[1:22:32] he'll diagnose it perfect every single
[1:22:34] time
[1:22:36] he says and he answers individually
[1:22:39] brother green
[1:22:39] used to say this and those who've been
[1:22:42] here well i wouldn't remember he said
[1:22:43] brother branham told me
[1:22:44] i was to push a wheelbarrow everywhere
[1:22:47] the rest of my life until jesus came i
[1:22:49] would do it
[1:22:51] but it wouldn't ask anybody else to do
[1:22:52] it
[1:22:54] sometimes god tells us something then we
[1:22:56] want everybody to do it just like us
[1:22:59] but god has individuals god has people
[1:23:01] playing
[1:23:02] each one of their parts this one doing
[1:23:05] this
[1:23:06] and this one doing that and and it's
[1:23:08] just
[1:23:09] sometimes you're not noticed sometimes
[1:23:12] not your
[1:23:12] nobody's even aware that you're doing
[1:23:15] that part until you don't do it
[1:23:17] and then somebody goes how come this
[1:23:19] didn't get done
[1:23:21] just like the body a lot of things
[1:23:24] happen in your body until something goes
[1:23:26] wrong
[1:23:27] you weren't even aware that you had
[1:23:28] those body parts
[1:23:30] interior body parts but let them stop
[1:23:32] working and suddenly these
[1:23:33] manifestations of problems
[1:23:36] the doctor says oh this and this is
[1:23:38] going wrong you go i didn't know i had a
[1:23:40] this and this
[1:23:41] but you do but god is aware of every bit
[1:23:44] of it
[1:23:46] even your favorite colors even your
[1:23:49] favorite food even the thing
[1:23:51] your favorite smells he's aware of it i
[1:23:53] was thinking about this and i remembered
[1:23:55] brother simmons brother merritt simmons
[1:23:57] and sister simmons dad would
[1:23:59] and and we got to know the brother
[1:24:01] simmons just at towards the end of his
[1:24:02] life but they talked about how he loved
[1:24:04] flowers
[1:24:05] and how he planted it all and when he
[1:24:07] passed away there were those same but
[1:24:09] brother simmons flowers we're not going
[1:24:11] to have them anymore
[1:24:13] and brother merritt's the one that
[1:24:14] shared this with me and he said you know
[1:24:17] there was a sister and she came up and
[1:24:19] she had dreamed
[1:24:23] brother brother simmons on the other
[1:24:24] side and
[1:24:26] he had come back and he had said you
[1:24:28] think those flowers so we're so
[1:24:30] beautiful here
[1:24:31] wait till you get on this side
[1:24:36] god comforts hearts god will go down and
[1:24:39] speak to your
[1:24:40] level what you have need of so if
[1:24:44] if some of the things we've got to
[1:24:45] experience place we've got to be i just
[1:24:47] wonder
[1:24:49] what what's there going to be on the
[1:24:51] other side so
[1:24:52] don't miss it that's the best way to
[1:24:56] know
[1:24:58] and the man was this man was trying to
[1:25:00] explain
[1:25:01] because the young lady or the young
[1:25:03] daughter had asked his her mother had
[1:25:04] passed away
[1:25:07] and she asked dad she said dad why did
[1:25:09] mom
[1:25:10] have to die explain try to explain that
[1:25:14] to a child it's
[1:25:15] sometimes even as adults you don't
[1:25:17] understand those things
[1:25:19] you say why god you know it
[1:25:22] everything seemed to be so good and then
[1:25:23] this went this way you know
[1:25:25] and and he was there and how do you
[1:25:28] explain it in
[1:25:29] a child's level so they can understand
[1:25:32] and as they were following the the um
[1:25:35] the group of going to the cemetery there
[1:25:38] was a large truck that
[1:25:39] get up they got in behind and he pulled
[1:25:42] up to it
[1:25:44] and he looked at the truck and he also
[1:25:45] noticed the shadow on the side as the
[1:25:47] sun was hitting and he looked to his
[1:25:49] daughter and he goes honey he says if
[1:25:52] you were to get run over would you
[1:25:54] rather get run over by the truck
[1:25:56] or the shadow of the truck
[1:25:59] and she stopped and she looked she said
[1:26:02] by the shadow of the truck it would hurt
[1:26:05] a whole lot less
[1:26:06] and he goes well that's exactly god got
[1:26:10] run over by the truck
[1:26:11] so that you and i could get run over by
[1:26:13] the shadow
[1:26:15] i thought what an explanation
[1:26:19] david said it this way though i walk
[1:26:21] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:26:22] death
[1:26:23] i will fear no evil he took it all for
[1:26:26] you
[1:26:26] so you didn't have to i said boy that
[1:26:29] that made it real to me
[1:26:32] now he took it all so that i wouldn't
[1:26:36] have to
[1:26:37] so he said that so that where i am you
[1:26:39] may be there also
[1:26:41] he says because then he said
[1:26:44] you know he he's he
[1:26:47] he experienced the very things that
[1:26:50] we're experiencing
[1:26:53] he had to in order to understand god as
[1:26:56] a spirit could not understand the
[1:26:57] feeling of the flesh
[1:26:59] the heartaches and the thing but when he
[1:27:01] took on flesh he could be hurt
[1:27:03] he he could have a broken heart you know
[1:27:06] so he says
[1:27:07] he he experienced these these are my
[1:27:10] words not something he said i just as he
[1:27:12] was listening
[1:27:13] he experienced everything that we're
[1:27:15] going through by living this life on
[1:27:16] earth
[1:27:18] he can say i've been there i've hurt i
[1:27:21] i've been tired i've been
[1:27:22] frustrated all of it he says
[1:27:26] in fact he cried out my god my god why
[1:27:29] has thou forsaken me
[1:27:31] so that when you would say i'm feeling
[1:27:33] alone i'm feeling left out i'm feeling
[1:27:35] abandoned he would say i know that
[1:27:36] feeling i shared that with you when i
[1:27:39] was praying here one day and i just
[1:27:40] asked the lord do you understand
[1:27:42] because you can't put god in that level
[1:27:45] trying to bring him down and say
[1:27:46] this majestic great god and bring him
[1:27:49] down to a level of a human
[1:27:52] i said lord do you understand my heart
[1:27:54] was hurt uh heavy and burdening
[1:27:56] do you understand the heaviness and the
[1:27:57] burden the feeling forsaken at times
[1:28:00] and his word just rung out to me and he
[1:28:02] said my god my god why has thou forsaken
[1:28:05] me
[1:28:06] i said you understand it thoroughly
[1:28:08] completely fully
[1:28:11] i know where you're at daughter i know
[1:28:12] where you're at son
[1:28:14] he says then he could turn around and
[1:28:16] say to you
[1:28:17] i will never leave you comfortless and i
[1:28:19] go to prepare a place for you
[1:28:23] because he'd been there and when you've
[1:28:26] been you've walked a mile in someone's
[1:28:27] shoes
[1:28:29] you can understand there's some some
[1:28:31] feeling some hurt for them
[1:28:33] somebody said you walk a mile in
[1:28:35] somebody else's shoes and then you can
[1:28:36] leave them there
[1:28:37] because you're a mile away from the
[1:28:38] other guy how they say don't
[1:28:42] don't judge a man don't criticize a man
[1:28:44] till you walk on a mile in his shoes and
[1:28:46] they said and then you're a mile away
[1:28:50] that's our attitude sometimes but he
[1:28:52] walked in our shoes so that he would
[1:28:54] understand feel i
[1:28:56] feel the feeling of your infirmities
[1:29:00] see trust comes in a relationship
[1:29:03] it doesn't come by words
[1:29:07] everybody can speak good things
[1:29:08] everybody can say nice
[1:29:10] things but in a relationship
[1:29:13] is when the trust is built or broken
[1:29:18] so when you've had a relationship with
[1:29:20] god and he's never failed you
[1:29:23] he's never left you alone he's never
[1:29:26] left you on the side of the road having
[1:29:27] to figure this out by yourself
[1:29:30] you know you can trust him for
[1:29:32] everything
[1:29:34] and on that basis of what you've learned
[1:29:37] and experiencing your relationship with
[1:29:39] christ
[1:29:40] you can learn or you've learned to trust
[1:29:42] him for what you don't know
[1:29:47] i don't know what tomorrow holds
[1:29:51] but i know who holds tomorrow you know
[1:29:54] i i asked prayer requests here not too
[1:29:57] long about having to go up there and
[1:29:59] work in phoenix
[1:30:01] and it's a lot of driving that's that's
[1:30:04] the part i didn't want to have to to
[1:30:06] spend all that time driving
[1:30:07] the two days that i wrote up there was
[1:30:09] close to 500 miles of driving
[1:30:11] and it's just you know it's that's not
[1:30:13] what i like to do
[1:30:15] and and i know tucson when they tell me
[1:30:18] to go here it's you know over there i
[1:30:19] was constantly having to look up the
[1:30:20] place and you know just
[1:30:22] so i asked the lord i said you know is
[1:30:24] there a way we can get around this so he
[1:30:25] did he worked out really well he got my
[1:30:27] schedule a lot more busy and i don't
[1:30:28] have to go up there anymore
[1:30:31] i'm now working six to eight hours a day
[1:30:33] when i was only working two or three
[1:30:34] hours a day for a while it was so slow
[1:30:36] because of cobit they canceled most of
[1:30:38] our work
[1:30:39] and now we've got a full day of work and
[1:30:41] i said lord you knew how to do it keep
[1:30:42] me right in tucson where i'm happiest
[1:30:46] now i might have asked him lord just let
[1:30:48] me stay at home and pay me
[1:30:49] you know but he knew that would be good
[1:30:52] for me
[1:30:53] no he said i can give you guys enough
[1:30:54] work in town and you can stay in town
[1:30:58] and and and he's good he meets our needs
[1:31:00] he takes care of us
[1:31:02] she says and how do you learn this by
[1:31:04] experience
[1:31:06] that's the best way to learn is
[1:31:09] experiencing it yourself hands on
[1:31:12] hearing that still small voice for
[1:31:14] yourself
[1:31:16] it's good to be encouraged and lifted up
[1:31:19] by the testimony of others
[1:31:22] because they do encourage us knowing
[1:31:23] that jesus christ is the same man
[1:31:25] but when he gets down and he encourages
[1:31:26] you personally
[1:31:28] and then it becomes even more real peter
[1:31:31] says this in
[1:31:32] first peter chapter 1
[1:31:36] verses 2 to 4 elect according to the
[1:31:39] foreknowledge of god
[1:31:40] the father through sanctification
[1:31:43] sanctification of the spirit
[1:31:44] unto obedience and the sprinkling of the
[1:31:47] blood of jesus christ
[1:31:49] grace unto you and peace be multiplied
[1:31:53] mercy and favor unto you and peace
[1:31:57] multiplied no end to that peace
[1:32:01] not a period at the end of peace but
[1:32:03] multiplied
[1:32:06] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:32:08] lord jesus christ which according to his
[1:32:10] abundant mercy
[1:32:12] has begotten us again unto a lively hope
[1:32:16] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[1:32:19] the dead there's the key
[1:32:23] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[1:32:25] the dead
[1:32:26] and you were part of him brother brahm
[1:32:29] talks about this
[1:32:30] being in him being part of him he
[1:32:32] brother branham how many times when he's
[1:32:34] given an explanation gets into the seed
[1:32:37] how much of it is about a seed
[1:32:40] everything that is in that seed
[1:32:43] is in that seed it's been there all
[1:32:44] along every fruit
[1:32:46] every flower every leaf is in that seed
[1:32:50] and what's in that seed is going to
[1:32:52] manifest itself
[1:32:55] so in him was life it had to manifest
[1:32:58] itself as life
[1:32:59] if he's in you how is it going to
[1:33:01] manifest the same as it manifests in
[1:33:03] because it's
[1:33:04] the original he talks about that that
[1:33:07] citrus
[1:33:08] i believe was up in the phoenix the
[1:33:09] citrus tree that had the ingredient
[1:33:12] they grafted in a vines you know there
[1:33:14] was a it was an orange tree but it had
[1:33:16] lemons and
[1:33:17] and other grapefruit and stuff and they
[1:33:18] were grafted in and brother brandon was
[1:33:20] talking to the man there
[1:33:21] and they said so when it produces
[1:33:25] uh uh then when they come again over
[1:33:27] next year that orange
[1:33:28] um branch is going to give
[1:33:33] lemons right because it's on the lemon
[1:33:34] base he goes no it'll give oranges
[1:33:37] but if the tree itself produces another
[1:33:40] limb it will give
[1:33:41] limits so you wonder sometimes why
[1:33:45] certain people and i'm going to say this
[1:33:47] quote unquote christians
[1:33:48] can produce something ungodly
[1:33:51] and still be happy about it and still be
[1:33:53] fine with it
[1:33:55] they're grafted in he says they're
[1:33:57] taking from the life of god because god
[1:33:59] is the giver of life
[1:34:01] but it manifests what they are
[1:34:05] but if it ever puts another branch out
[1:34:07] it's going to be
[1:34:08] godly life and this is by the wreck
[1:34:12] the resurrection of jesus christ from
[1:34:14] the dead to an inheritance
[1:34:16] incorruptible and undefiled that
[1:34:19] fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[1:34:23] for you that fadeth not away
[1:34:26] doesn't lose its splendor doesn't lose
[1:34:29] its significance doesn't lose its value
[1:34:32] it's just as much if not more so than
[1:34:35] it's ever been
[1:34:37] i'm looking forward to that are you is
[1:34:40] that your desire saying lord
[1:34:42] that scripture is mine you know
[1:34:46] and sometimes you know we get to
[1:34:47] thinking and i i would stop thinking i
[1:34:49] said what
[1:34:50] is heaven going to be like
[1:34:54] and i remind myself many times what
[1:34:56] brother brahm said when he went beyond
[1:34:57] the curtain of time
[1:34:58] how many believes that actually happened
[1:35:02] or did brother brahm just make up things
[1:35:04] to draw the people
[1:35:06] no brother branham spoke of the things
[1:35:09] because he experienced them
[1:35:12] and you know what you can experience the
[1:35:13] same things that brother brahm did the
[1:35:15] same god
[1:35:17] speaking to you making it real making it
[1:35:19] alive to you calling you by name
[1:35:21] dealing with you the very things that he
[1:35:23] knows would catch your heart and your
[1:35:25] attention
[1:35:26] you know if somebody comes by and
[1:35:28] they're talking about something that you
[1:35:30] have
[1:35:30] no interest in at all and they're trying
[1:35:33] to talk to you you're trying to figure
[1:35:34] out a way how to get this to stop
[1:35:37] change the conversation do something
[1:35:38] different whatever
[1:35:40] but if somebody comes by and starts
[1:35:42] talking tacos
[1:35:44] they got my attention until we're done
[1:35:48] uh you know the other day when we were
[1:35:50] buying all the plants
[1:35:52] and um she said well i'm just going to
[1:35:54] take two or three i said no they're on
[1:35:56] sale they were half
[1:35:57] a regular 25 each they had them on sale
[1:35:59] for 14. i said let's get them all today
[1:36:03] you had your eye surgery already right
[1:36:06] so she couldn't bend over lift anything
[1:36:08] and
[1:36:09] so i'm with her and i'm picking him up
[1:36:11] putting him on the cart and then she
[1:36:12] says while we're here let's do this and
[1:36:14] while we're here we do this and i
[1:36:15] started counting tacos
[1:36:17] that's one dozen that's two dozen that's
[1:36:20] three dozen
[1:36:22] and so the lady at the cash register
[1:36:24] she's
[1:36:25] she's pushing him doing i'm doing this i
[1:36:27] go she's paying me in tacos
[1:36:29] i said she has she's at three dozen
[1:36:31] right now and she started laughing she
[1:36:33] goes
[1:36:33] i think it's worth it found somebody
[1:36:36] that
[1:36:36] agrees with me but you know the things
[1:36:39] that that you know and we laugh about i
[1:36:40] do eat other stuff
[1:36:41] honest but uh things that that in
[1:36:45] your heart that you know you love that
[1:36:47] you cherish you like it's
[1:36:48] and it's not i'm not talking about
[1:36:49] ungodly things things that are okay
[1:36:51] things
[1:36:52] are they're fine that that god has given
[1:36:54] us on this earth
[1:36:55] you know places to go uh things to see
[1:36:58] or
[1:36:58] whatever it is some that do hobbies that

[1:37:50] god treats us the same way what's your
[1:37:52] desire what's your heart
[1:37:54] lord you've blessed my brother and
[1:37:56] you've blessed my sister
[1:37:58] and while you're doing that i know that
[1:38:00] i'm one of yours
[1:38:02] and he loves to share his blessings he
[1:38:05] loves to meet you
[1:38:06] as an individual in your needs to see
[1:38:10] that god cares
[1:38:11] what are the things that he has prepared
[1:38:13] for us
[1:38:14] what's on the other side um we have
[1:38:17] loved ones that have crossed over
[1:38:19] you know especially some of those now
[1:38:22] who have especially older in age have
[1:38:23] lost
[1:38:24] father and have lost mother and maybe
[1:38:26] brothers and sisters i i think of my f
[1:38:28] my dad
[1:38:29] he's the only one of the him and his one
[1:38:32] brother living and
[1:38:33] and two sisters but he's lost quite a
[1:38:35] few others
[1:38:37] my wife lost both of her parents already
[1:38:40] there's something there for us to see
[1:38:42] them to
[1:38:43] god knows that but to each one
[1:38:46] the greatest thing is him but he said
[1:38:50] all that the father has given me
[1:38:54] will come and i won't put
[1:38:57] anyone out it's not my job to put them
[1:38:59] out it's my job to try to draw them
[1:39:01] in and he said i go to a play prepare a
[1:39:04] place in my
[1:39:05] father's house are many mansions in this
[1:39:09] thing that the brothers sent me
[1:39:12] and and uh he put you know brother brown
[1:39:14] said there's maybe one in tucson and two
[1:39:17] in phoenix and just that would be three
[1:39:18] in arizona and he's majoring at only
[1:39:20] three in arizona are going to make it
[1:39:23] i said what spirit is that
[1:39:27] when i would say lord jesus let my
[1:39:30] brother my sister each one that can be
[1:39:32] go there now and and he may be listening
[1:39:36] and i've had these conversations with
[1:39:37] him before
[1:39:38] i don't know if he is or not but i'm
[1:39:41] looking for a body change
[1:39:43] i'm looking to leave this earth to that
[1:39:45] other place i just don't want
[1:39:47] quote unquote a spiritual rapture i want
[1:39:49] to be in spiritual places in christ
[1:39:50] jesus
[1:39:51] but i'm looking for a physical change
[1:39:54] and i want the very things that he wants
[1:39:56] for me
[1:39:56] because they're best for me because
[1:40:00] his desire is like like he said in
[1:40:02] jeremiah 29 11
[1:40:04] i know the thoughts that i have for you
[1:40:08] not of evil but of good to bring you an
[1:40:10] expected in
[1:40:11] or the reward the very things in other
[1:40:15] words the expected ending is
[1:40:16] what he's already planned what he's
[1:40:18] already laid out and it's not going to
[1:40:20] miss you know thinking about this and
[1:40:24] and and listening to some of the things
[1:40:26] this man said he was talking a little
[1:40:27] bit about job
[1:40:29] and job's three friends that came to
[1:40:33] comfort him and
[1:40:35] and more about accusations and comfort
[1:40:39] but finally in chapter 38 god comes to
[1:40:42] see him
[1:40:43] on the whirlwind and he puts his arm
[1:40:46] around your wall
[1:40:47] job you poor little guy you really have
[1:40:49] suffered yeah
[1:40:50] no he didn't do that he listened he
