[33:36] that's what we live for
[33:39] we have some requests
[33:41] to
[33:42] bring to your attention
[33:45] for those of you who have been here for
[33:47] a while you might remember
[33:50] brother jacob and alma lopez had
[33:52] attended church here for some time
[33:55] jacob called brother arne and asked us
[33:57] to remember
[33:58] his twelve-year-old grandson named
[34:00] nehemiah with serious heart conditions
[34:03] they had a hospital here in tucson but
[34:05] then they took him to a hospital in san
[34:07] diego for
[34:08] for a serious heart situation so
[34:11] little nehemiah will remember that
[34:16] and then
[34:17] sister amelia asked us to remember her
[34:20] in prayer she's
[34:21] not been feeling well so we'll do that
[34:27] and then
[34:28] [Music]
[34:29] my wife
[34:31] texts i believe with sister connie and
[34:34] sister connie had request prayer
[34:36] for her and brother kevin and they both
[34:38] tested positive for for coping
[34:41] so we'll remember them in prayer
[34:43] [Music]
[34:45] um
[34:46] brother robert figueroa spoke with him
[34:49] yesterday and
[34:51] they both brother robert and sister
[34:53] dalia were positive and brothers robert
[34:55] said he had gone up to 104 degrees the
[34:58] other day in temperature
[35:00] but he sent out a request to the church
[35:03] to remember him in prayer right then and
[35:05] he said within 10 minutes
[35:06] the folks were responding were praying
[35:08] and the temperature came back down to
[35:10] about a hundred
[35:12] so god answers prayer
[35:14] but in the in the process and speaking
[35:17] with him and also his son bobby called
[35:19] me
[35:20] and
[35:21] somebody in each part of the family has
[35:23] had tested positive for kobit
[35:26] uh including sister jessica when she
[35:28] went back home to pennsylvania one of
[35:30] her daughters
[35:32] one of brother jude's son's
[35:34] brother robert bobby jr told me that
[35:36] pretty well all of his family was not
[35:38] feeling well
[35:40] and so
[35:41] we would
[35:43] they were requesting prayer but also
[35:46] knowing that god answers prayer
[35:48] it's it's not without
[35:51] just a hope and i hope so but there's an
[35:53] assurance
[35:55] that he's the same yesterday today and
[35:56] forever but seeing this body
[36:00] in the flesh we have troubles we have
[36:03] things but he's a god that delivereth
[36:05] from all all of it and that's why our
[36:07] desire is for that other party
[36:09] to to get past that so also to remember
[36:13] brother merle and sister roberta baggett
[36:15] as they prepare to
[36:16] to go
[36:17] spend time with their daughter priscilla
[36:19] and brother joe and the family
[36:21] and everything goes well they'll believe
[36:23] in sunday to newfoundland and he kind of
[36:26] explained all that they were going to
[36:27] have to go through this week to prepare
[36:29] and to be able to go so
[36:31] we'll remember that that would all work
[36:33] out for them to be able to go today
[36:35] this weekend and be able to spend some
[36:37] time i believe sister priscilla is
[36:41] due to have a child a baby here real
[36:43] soon so that would be really good to
[36:45] have mama with her so
[36:47] we wanted to remember that and
[36:51] because of of
[36:53] those testing positive to covid they had
[36:56] the
[36:57] progressive dinner for the young people
[37:01] and
[37:02] from a couple of churches in our church
[37:04] and so we know there has been some
[37:06] exposure to it so there was a question
[37:09] is how we we should handle this and we
[37:11] just
[37:13] failed to just say this way if you know
[37:15] you're suffering with some type of
[37:17] symptom you are sick
[37:19] take care of yourself stay home
[37:21] just just be safe
[37:24] if you have a concern you're nervous
[37:25] you're worried about it then if you feel
[37:27] safe for the statement it's okay
[37:29] nobody's going to hold it against you
[37:32] and
[37:32] i know there are some folks that aren't
[37:34] quarantined right now because they know
[37:36] they've been exposed but we will have
[37:38] sunday morning service
[37:40] and you just be cautious
[37:42] i was listening to brother donald reagan
[37:44] the other day as he was addressing his
[37:45] congregation
[37:47] and he said just don't let the fear
[37:50] take control
[37:52] that that's what you don't want to be
[37:54] afraid of it he said because he's a god
[37:56] that healeth he healeth all our diseases
[37:59] he said but also be cautious take care
[38:01] of yourself so
[38:03] i just good advice i believe so
[38:07] if you have a need if we'll stand
[38:08] together you have a need
[38:11] and i know we raise our hands quite
[38:14] often but every day
[38:16] i know there's something we have need of
[38:18] just um
[38:20] talking to different folks and everybody
[38:22] has desires and needs in their lives so
[38:25] and we know that he supplies every need
[38:27] he has met it so talking with brother
[38:30] peter just a little bit before we came
[38:32] in and
[38:33] realized what a great god we serve
[38:35] almighty god we serve just just been
[38:36] reading things different different
[38:39] things that that
[38:41] the scripture tells us some of the
[38:42] things that brother branham said even
[38:43] different ministers
[38:45] what a mighty god we serve
[38:48] but we also live in flesh
[38:50] and that flesh is subject to that which
[38:52] is around
[38:53] but he delivereth from also i believe
[38:56] you lord and i trust in you lord we we
[38:58] raise our hand because we do have a need
[39:00] but then we raise another hand because
[39:02] we know that every need is supplied lord

[39:08] so much happening on this earth and

[44:34] amen
[44:44] i was saying the other morning at the
[44:46] breakfast
[44:48] i'm always just a little bit late
[44:52] and i was preaching at a united brethren
[44:55] church not long ago
[44:57] and i was coming in about an hour late
[45:00] and so the minister said
[45:03] i will now introduce the late
[45:05] mr ram
[45:09] i said well i've always been a little
[45:11] late
[45:12] my mother said i was a full
[45:15] nine months baby
[45:18] it didn't look like i didn't have enough
[45:19] time i only weighed five pounds
[45:23] when i was married i
[45:25] she waited for me for about an hour i
[45:27] held the whole thing up and
[45:29] made a hospital call and come back
[45:32] if i can just be late for my funeral now
[45:34] that's the next thing if i just put that
[45:36] off
[45:38] i don't want that to come too quick
[45:41] so i want to stay and serve the lord
[45:44] it's good to be here
[45:46] and to have this fine audience of people
[45:48] out again tonight
[45:50] i think in the morning to you that live
[45:52] up around los angeles
[45:54] there is a christian
[45:56] businessman's breakfast in the morning i
[45:59] believe he's still holding at the
[46:00] clifton's cafeteria
[46:03] and i
[46:04] hope to be there in the morning i have
[46:06] learned that
[46:07] brother secarin has been pretty ill
[46:11] he's going to be there well that's fine
[46:13] brother demas shakarian
[46:15] a personal brother good friend of mine
[46:19] i'm sorry to hear about it i heard he
[46:21] got a little sick but didn't know he was
[46:23] as sick as what he was
[46:24] just got run down
[46:26] i told him about two years ago you
[46:28] better pull in just a little bit look
[46:30] back said practice what you preach and
[46:31] so
[46:33] uh
[46:35] i remember the last time here when
[46:37] raymond richie
[46:39] caught me by the trouser leg as he was
[46:40] coming into the church down here in los
[46:42] angeles that
[46:44] noah beg your pardon and
[46:47] long beach
[46:48] was going into the auditorium there that
[46:50] night raymond's a personal friend of
[46:52] mine
[46:53] he had a breakdown he's in a terrible
[46:55] condition he said
[46:56] brother branham don't go too long he
[46:58] just come back from korea
[47:00] raymond get a little far up the road too
[47:03] you know he said
[47:05] you'll kill yourself and said then look
[47:06] what a condition i'm in now
[47:09] and uh i've been along those lines so i
[47:11] know what it is i
[47:13] see so much to be done yet
[47:15] it looks like you haven't got time to do
[47:16] it it makes you nervous so i just hope
[47:18] the lord forgives me
[47:20] that my
[47:22] zeal will not overcome my wisdom
[47:26] you give me wisdom to know how to handle
[47:27] my zeal or other
[47:29] it's nice to be here tonight with you
[47:31] brethren
[47:35] so nice this nice audience here i'm just
[47:38] so glad to see the
[47:40] these meetings look like everybody just
[47:42] in one heart one a card
[47:45] looks like anything could happen
[47:48] the last few meetings has been that way
[47:49] and i'm just so thankful to the lord as
[47:52] long as they continue like that i feel
[47:53] like i can just keep moving on a while
[47:56] it's when you hit those crossfires
[47:59] that's when it's bad you know and and
[48:00] the no unity and but here it's just been
[48:03] just one great big brotherhood
[48:06] everything
[48:07] just so thankful for them
[48:10] may the lord continue now we realize
[48:12] that we haven't got the tinsel on the
[48:14] meetings that we did at the first time
[48:17] uh usually a revival breaks out
[48:21] unless according to history about three
[48:23] years a minister usually gives his best
[48:26] in three years after that he lives on
[48:28] his reputation of what he made in those
[48:30] three years
[48:31] i'm so glad i placed mine upon the word
[48:34] that's right so i can live by the word
[48:38] i just believe this blessed whole bible
[48:40] i just think it's the grandest thing and
[48:43] i think it is it is god
[48:45] the word is god in letter form
[48:50] and when the holy spirit lines up on it
[48:53] it just brings it to life
[48:55] i was talking to someone
[48:57] we have private interviews
[49:01] and that's where you have to
[49:03] we about way at home i think there's 300
[49:07] on the list when we left waiting for
[49:08] those private interviews we go in with
[49:10] the people
[49:12] just pull the curtains down
[49:14] and we stay there until we pray until
[49:18] the lord reveals by a vision what to do
[49:22] now we know the word of the lord tells
[49:24] us and lays out the program but this
[49:26] sometimes is there's things in a
[49:28] person's life that they don't know just
[49:30] what to do
[49:32] and there's where we stay before the
[49:33] lord until it's answered
[49:36] and then we hit these interviews like we
[49:38] come over here the people in this
[49:40] district maybe has been waiting some of
[49:42] them for four or five years for these
[49:44] interviews
[49:45] and we were speaking i believe it was
[49:47] yesterday or this morning one
[49:51] that about
[49:52] the
[49:54] light
[49:55] shining in the last days
[49:58] now i have refrained from preaching
[50:01] because i'm just here to pray for the
[50:03] sick and to put my neck with my brethren
[50:06] and pull
[50:07] but i truly believe that we're living in
[50:10] the last days
[50:13] it's right at the end time
[50:16] i'd like to take a a group like this a
[50:18] unity of spirit and heart
[50:22] and i wish we had about
[50:24] about two or three weeks that we could
[50:26] just start through
[50:28] having afternoon services and morning
[50:31] services and evening services and just
[50:34] bringing the bible as we see it
[50:37] and uh
[50:39] been so thankful he's a greek
[50:41] scholar studying behind me
[50:43] and is with him the other day the man is
[50:46] from greece his father is a noted
[50:49] minister
[50:51] in greece
[50:52] and he takes my tapes and he said
[50:54] brother branham i thought you were a
[50:56] greek scholar
[50:58] i said i don't even know good english
[51:01] let alone one word agree he said but
[51:05] bringing your nouns pronouns and
[51:06] everything in your teaching on your
[51:08] tapes says i can put a line like this
[51:11] and it divides it perfectly and hits
[51:13] right in with the greek and i said well
[51:15] i'm thankful for that because i always
[51:19] try to
[51:20] feel led of the holy spirit to say what
[51:23] i say
[51:24] and uh if it said anything contrary to
[51:27] the bible then i wouldn't believe it see
[51:29] i wouldn't believe that it was
[51:31] uh the holy spirit because it will
[51:33] always stay in the bible the holy spirit
[51:36] will
[51:38] and we were talking about this little
[51:40] woman
[51:41] that us this afternoon this morning i
[51:43] believe it was that we were talking
[51:45] about the little woman that i spoke of
[51:47] the
[51:48] ill-famed little fella that came out to
[51:51] the well
[51:53] at sachar
[51:54] and she
[51:56] seen the lord jesus and not recognizing
[51:59] yet
[51:59] she was
[52:01] to be one of his disciples i
[52:05] have a little funny doctrine and if it
[52:08] don't go just right with yours you do
[52:10] the same way i do when i'm eating fried
[52:11] chicken at your house
[52:13] i just love fried chicken and when i hit
[52:15] a bone i don't quit eating chicken i
[52:17] just throw the bone away and keep eating
[52:18] chicken so
[52:19] you believe the same thing
[52:21] now i believe that the church's name was
[52:25] put on the lamb's book of life before
[52:27] the foundation of the world when before
[52:29] the lamb was slain
[52:31] because the bible said the antichrist
[52:33] would deceive all upon the earth whose
[52:35] names were not written in the lamb's
[52:37] book of life slain before the foundation
[52:40] of the world
[52:41] i believe the infinite god by his
[52:43] foreknowledge saw the church now i know
[52:46] it's a ticklish subject and remember
[52:48] there's a truth to it i don't believe it
[52:51] in the line of many does but i believe
[52:53] that there is by for knowledge god could
[52:56] tell the end from the beginning because
[52:58] he's the infinite god
[53:00] now whether i'm part of that church i
[53:02] hope i am i'm just
[53:04] seeking out my own salvation with fear
[53:06] and trembling staying right in the word
[53:08] but if i get out of there then i'll pray
[53:10] to get back in it again
[53:11] and so
[53:13] when that
[53:15] it's not a good word to use
[53:17] see but by that
[53:19] predestinated seed laying in that little
[53:22] woman
[53:23] believing watching yet in her
[53:26] sinful condition she was watching for a
[53:29] coming of a messiah
[53:31] the church order in that day was so
[53:34] almost like it is the day she
[53:36] she just soon lived like she was living
[53:40] and of course she's seen the ridiculous
[53:42] of how the people have professed to be
[53:44] religious and was nothing but a lord of
[53:47] hypocrisy and i say that not to be
[53:50] sacrilegious i say that with honesty and
[53:52] sincere in my heart love for everybody
[53:56] and then when that
[53:58] when
[53:59] she was standing there waiting
[54:01] to see what the answer that man was when
[54:03] she said it's not customary she was
[54:06] getting in the tradition then of the
[54:08] elders
[54:09] for you jews to ask samaritan me a woman
[54:12] of samara such a
[54:15] thing or have any dealings he said but
[54:17] if you knew who you were speaking to you
[54:19] would ask me for water
[54:21] then
[54:23] the question come up and jesus said go
[54:26] get your husband
[54:27] she said i have none he said well you
[54:30] have said
[54:31] because you have had five and the one
[54:34] you're living with now is not your
[54:35] husband quickly
[54:37] watch there was that predestinated seed
[54:40] eternal life
[54:42] all the father has given me will come
[54:46] no man can come unless he
[54:49] calls see all the father hath
[54:53] past tense given me
[54:56] will come
[54:58] and when that light flashed across that
[55:01] predestinated seed quickly not like them
[55:04] educated scholars standing over there
[55:06] criticizing
[55:08] they thought they were in that group but
[55:10] they wasn't
[55:11] they called him beelzebub but as soon as
[55:13] he hit that predestinated seat that
[55:16] light flashed across and she said sir
[55:26] we know messiah when he comes he'll do
[55:29] this kind of a work he said i'm he that
[55:32] speaks with you oh my god that's
[55:35] what all the father has given me
[55:38] we only sow seeds
[55:41] god
[55:42] lodges them wherever he will some falls
[55:45] for the wayside some comes up in thorns
[55:47] for a few days and this will choke them
[55:49] out and so forth and others go into the
[55:51] right place i don't know where they are
[55:53] we just stole them
[55:55] thank you god bless you now let us read
[55:58] the word
[56:00] now i
[56:02] want to take if it be all right
[56:06] the opportunity tonight
[56:08] to kindly teach just a little
[56:11] nothing out of the ordinary just little
[56:13] teaching and maybe
[56:16] sunday afternoon the lord willing i
[56:18] would like to teach a little message to
[56:21] the church if the lord permits so nice
[56:24] of these brethren here that told me
[56:26] brother branham if the nice letter all
[56:28] of them sign it we turn you into the
[56:30] pulpit preach what's on your heart
[56:33] uh that's i couldn't have no more
[56:35] liberty than that
[56:36] and so i i'm very grateful for a group
[56:39] of men
[56:42] mostly ministers are suspicious because
[56:45] they have a right to be
[56:47] they are shepherds and they want to know
[56:49] what their flocks are eating that's
[56:51] right they should know
[56:53] and a man that's got dignity and honor
[56:56] wouldn't do nothing to hurt anyone or
[56:58] any flock he would always try to give it
[57:01] some vitamins if anything cut into the
[57:04] into the flock so maybe the lord will
[57:07] give us some vitamins on the same words
[57:09] that we've heard many times let us turn
[57:12] tonight to the second book of the kings
[57:16] and readjust the potion of the scripture
[57:20] then moab
[57:22] rebelled against israel after the death
[57:25] of ahab and ahaza
[57:27] fell down through the lattice in the
[57:29] upper chamber that was in samaria
[57:33] and was sick
[57:34] and he sent messengers and said unto
[57:37] them go
[57:39] of
[57:40] beelzebub
[57:42] the god of acorn
[57:45] whether i shall recover of this disease
[57:49] but the angel of the lord said unto
[57:52] elijah
[57:53] the tishbite
[57:55] rise and go meet the messengers
[57:58] of the king of samaria and say unto them
[58:02] is it not because there is not a god in
[58:05] israel
[58:06] that you go to inquire of the elders
[58:09] above the god of icara
[58:12] now wherefore thus saith the lord
[58:16] thou shalt not come down from that bed
[58:18] on which thou has gone up
[58:21] but shall surely die
[58:23] and elijah departed
[58:25] and when the messengers turned back unto
[58:27] him
[58:28] he said unto them why are you now turned
[58:31] back
[58:32] and they said unto him there came a man
[58:35] up to meet us
[58:36] and said unto this
[58:38] goal turn again unto the king that sent
[58:40] you
[58:41] and say unto him thus saith the lord
[58:44] is it not because there is not a god in
[58:47] israel that thou sent us to inquire of
[58:50] the elves above the god of aeochon
[58:52] therefore
[58:54] thou shalt not come down
[58:56] from that bed on which thou art gone up
[59:00] but shall surely die
[59:02] and he said unto them
[59:04] what matter of man was he which came
[59:07] to meet thee and told thee these words
[59:10] and they answered him
[59:12] he was a hairy man girded with a
[59:16] girdle of leather about his loins
[59:18] and he said it is elijah
[59:22] the tishbite
[59:24] now
[59:25] in jeremiah
[59:28] for a text if i should call it in
[59:30] jeremiah the 8th chapter and the 22nd
[59:34] verse
[59:36] is there no bomb in gilead
[59:39] is there no physician there
[59:42] why then is not the health of the
[59:44] daughter of my people
[59:46] recovered
[59:49] and i would like to take the subject if
[59:52] it should be called such
[59:54] the text rather
[59:56] as the little word of why wh
[1:00:01] wow
[1:00:03] i hope i'm not too loud back there if
[1:00:06] the engineer of this will kind of govern
[1:00:08] it they got a little yolk around my neck
[1:00:11] tonight here
[1:00:12] so uh i hope i don't get too loud
[1:00:17] and it's good for my
[1:00:19] rough voice
[1:00:20] when god
[1:00:22] makes a way of escape for the people
[1:00:26] and the people refuse that escape
[1:00:30] then god asks the question
[1:00:33] why
[1:00:35] i think he has a right to
[1:00:38] if god does all that he can
[1:00:41] for the people
[1:00:43] and the people refuse to receive his
[1:00:46] help
[1:00:47] then he has a right to ask why they
[1:00:50] didn't do it
[1:00:52] i believe it'll be that way at the
[1:00:53] judgment
[1:00:54] when god has made every preparation that
[1:00:57] could be made
[1:01:00] for the church and for the people and
[1:01:02] then they refuse it
[1:01:04] god's going to ask us why we didn't
[1:01:06] receive it
[1:01:08] i believe that now
[1:01:12] we find out
[1:01:14] that this ehaza was the son of ahab and
[1:01:18] jesse bell
[1:01:20] they had
[1:01:21] come out of a cursed family
[1:01:25] and when you take a family that's
[1:01:28] raising their children in the wrong
[1:01:30] atmosphere you can hardly expect
[1:01:33] anything else
[1:01:36] israel was a nation something like this
[1:01:39] nation
[1:01:40] it made its same mistakes that this
[1:01:42] nations made
[1:01:45] and we find out that israel come up out
[1:01:48] of egypt and drove the occupants out of
[1:01:51] the land
[1:01:52] and possess the land
[1:01:54] the same that we come seeking an oase
[1:01:57] and drove the native shearer back and
[1:01:59] possessed the land
[1:02:01] israel had
[1:02:03] favor before god we believe that our
[1:02:06] pilgrim fathers did also
[1:02:09] israel in his early stages produced some
[1:02:12] great man
[1:02:13] uh
[1:02:14] well
[1:02:15] they had for instance david
[1:02:18] solomon
[1:02:19] joshua
[1:02:21] great man
[1:02:23] and we had a washington lincoln
[1:02:26] and a great man
[1:02:29] but finally israel
[1:02:31] in its politics
[1:02:34] formed around and got a renegade on the
[1:02:38] throne
[1:02:40] ahab
[1:02:41] a halfway believer
[1:02:44] lukewarm church member
[1:02:47] and ahab wasn't such a a rascal
[1:02:50] as it was
[1:02:52] his wife all right
[1:02:55] she was
[1:02:56] one that
[1:02:57] could just handle ahab any way she
[1:03:01] wanted to make him go she did it
[1:03:04] and you don't have to be too spiritual
[1:03:06] to understand what i'm talking about
[1:03:12] it's the system behind it
[1:03:15] but in that day they had a prophet
[1:03:18] and his name was elijah
[1:03:20] and he was a fearless godly man
[1:03:24] and i think a lot of you do good
[1:03:25] democrats that soldier of birthrights of
[1:03:28] politics to do such an evil thing as
[1:03:30] you've done
[1:03:32] stop being merciful
[1:03:35] one day this nation knowed that old
[1:03:37] thing but she's forgotten she sold out
[1:03:40] because the church got lukewarm
[1:03:43] got away from god that's exactly i
[1:03:46] better leave off of that because i said
[1:03:47] i wasn't going to preach them
[1:03:49] now
[1:03:50] as we go on but you know what i'm
[1:03:52] thinking
[1:03:53] notice
[1:03:55] but in that same day god sent a mighty
[1:03:58] one in the land
[1:03:59] just before that there come a plague
[1:04:02] that swept the land out
[1:04:04] and god was proven
[1:04:07] now
[1:04:08] doing this after ahab's death his sun
[1:04:11] tucky's place
[1:04:13] and um ezekie
[1:04:16] and he reigned in samaria and one day
[1:04:19] walking out in the lattices he fell
[1:04:23] through and some disease set into the
[1:04:26] a place where he got hurt
[1:04:29] and now instead of following like the
[1:04:33] forefathers did to consult god about it
[1:04:36] he sent to
[1:04:38] the idol
[1:04:40] beelzebub
[1:04:43] it's a strange thing that a man that's
[1:04:46] supposed to be an israelite would
[1:04:48] consult such as that instead of going
[1:04:51] back to the very god that brought him
[1:04:53] over into that land and give it to them
[1:04:56] because he was trying to follow the
[1:04:58] trend of the day and after his father
[1:05:00] and mother
[1:05:02] that's what's happened in the churches
[1:05:04] today too much
[1:05:06] we have got away from the spiritual
[1:05:08] application
[1:05:09] of the principles that this nation
[1:05:12] stands for
[1:05:13] and has got up on politics and union and
[1:05:17] big time and belly full and a new car
[1:05:20] and new homes and and got away from the
[1:05:23] real principles of things
[1:05:26] the real principles of christianity
[1:05:29] it's too bad we have to say these things
[1:05:31] but somebody's got to say it and it's
[1:05:34] got to come to pass
[1:05:36] we must be frank and honest and sincere
[1:05:40] and you do not need spiritual
[1:05:42] interpretation because it's before your
[1:05:44] eyes
[1:05:45] you can see it but we have as they did
[1:05:48] in those days sold our birthrights
[1:05:51] for a mess of pottage
[1:05:53] and we are going to reap just what we
[1:05:57] sowed and it's done past now
[1:06:00] and the revival that we had sweeping
[1:06:02] across the country it's died down to a
[1:06:04] little smoldering uh flame here and
[1:06:08] there or something we don't want to
[1:06:09] believe it but it's the truth that's
[1:06:11] right
[1:06:13] and uh we went out and sold a bunch of
[1:06:15] great denominational seeds and when the
[1:06:18] spirit fell what did we reap a
[1:06:20] denominational crop
[1:06:21] if we sold the word of god we'd reap the
[1:06:24] church of god if we would have done it
[1:06:27] but we got off on the wrong side the
[1:06:30] rain comes up on the earth to water it
[1:06:32] and if whatever what kind of seed is in
[1:06:34] the field that's what it brings forth
[1:06:36] that's right
[1:06:38] and so the same holy spirit that brings
[1:06:40] forth uh the church of the living god
[1:06:43] brings forth the weeds also the
[1:06:45] denominationals but you see what we've
[1:06:47] agreed million more and 44 for baptism
[1:06:50] so forth and on down and that's what
[1:06:51] we've reaped just exactly as we sowed
[1:06:54] it's always going to be that way and
[1:06:56] israel was
[1:06:58] just reap what she had sowed and this
[1:07:01] a young fellow had come in now to take
[1:07:04] over
[1:07:04] and
[1:07:05] instead of sending down and seeking god
[1:07:10] to the people that had come there to
[1:07:12] this great uh economy that god had given
[1:07:15] in he sent over to uh
[1:07:17] the
[1:07:18] popular idol of the day
[1:07:21] the beelzebub the popular religion among
[1:07:24] the people
[1:07:26] just a few were holding a torchlight
[1:07:29] and elijah was the great prophet of that
[1:07:33] day
[1:07:34] and he forgot about elijah he didn't
[1:07:37] care about elijah because elijah would
[1:07:40] have told him where he was standing
[1:07:42] therefore they don't want to know what's
[1:07:44] the truth they'd rather take this other
[1:07:45] way not realizing that you're going to
[1:07:48] reap what you sow amen exactly that's
[1:07:51] the law of nature
[1:07:52] you do it
[1:07:54] it's the law of the spirit you certainly
[1:07:57] have to do it now
[1:07:59] but you know god reveals his secrets to
[1:08:02] his prophets the bible said over amos
[1:08:05] surely god will do nothing except he
[1:08:07] reveals to his prophets and then when
[1:08:09] this
[1:08:10] messenger is on the road over to
[1:08:14] meet the priest
[1:08:15] and to find out from beelzebub the
[1:08:18] condition of their king and what would
[1:08:20] be the outcome
[1:08:22] they didn't want to take god's way
[1:08:25] to line up with god's word to line up
[1:08:27] with god's way of doing things they
[1:08:29] wanted to live any way they wanted to
[1:08:32] and still be religious
[1:08:34] that's what the this nation has come to
[1:08:37] today
[1:08:38] it just don't want to line up with god
[1:08:40] it wants to live any way it wants to but
[1:08:42] it wants to be religious so it'll take
[1:08:44] the easiest way out
[1:08:47] it always finds that water seeps its
[1:08:49] level
[1:08:50] always now
[1:08:52] they had another arm to lean on they
[1:08:55] didn't need jehovah anymore they didn't
[1:08:57] want that strict way they wanted to live
[1:08:59] after their own lust in their own
[1:09:01] fashions and yet they could be religious
[1:09:04] but remember wade down there in that
[1:09:06] cave pulled back an old hairy looking
[1:09:08] man with look like a fuzzy worm back in
[1:09:11] there but under that little brown skin
[1:09:14] and skinny arms beat the heart that god
[1:09:17] lived in
[1:09:19] he said elijah arise and go up there and
[1:09:22] meet him
[1:09:24] oh my what we needed is another elijah
[1:09:28] not afraid to tell the truth
[1:09:32] went up there and stood in the way piece
[1:09:34] of sheepskin there were leather around
[1:09:36] his
[1:09:37] launch chair to gird him up
[1:09:39] and there he stood the fuzz all over his
[1:09:41] face and
[1:09:42] and i suppose he didn't take a bath
[1:09:44] every night and
[1:09:45] use his forks and knives the way we do
[1:09:47] here in hollywood and
[1:09:49] shine up the way we do but yet god was
[1:09:52] with him
[1:09:53] god was in him
[1:09:56] we put so much stress on the traditions
[1:09:58] of the day
[1:09:59] now we notice
[1:10:01] now he stood in the way when these
[1:10:03] messengers come up
[1:10:05] and he said is it because gold telling
[1:10:08] is it because there is not a god in
[1:10:11] israel
[1:10:12] is there no prophet here
[1:10:14] is that the reason oh there was a god
[1:10:17] and there was a prophet
[1:10:19] but it was a king's own stubbornness
[1:10:23] he didn't want to line up with god in
[1:10:25] his prophet
[1:10:27] and that was the reason that the king
[1:10:29] was seeking the easiest way out of these
[1:10:32] things
[1:10:34] he said is it because there is no
[1:10:36] prophet there is no god in israel
[1:10:39] there's no other there's no way of
[1:10:40] finding it
[1:10:42] i wonder today if it is the day that we
[1:10:45] seek comfort we have just lost left some
[1:10:49] holidays
[1:10:50] people go out and get drunk on those
[1:10:51] holidays their sunday school teachers
[1:10:54] church members choir members go out and
[1:10:57] drink and crowds and gambling and the
[1:10:59] people live just the way they want to
[1:11:02] and yet they belong to the highest
[1:11:04] churches there is in the city
[1:11:06] some of the highest order of this
[1:11:07] intellectual ecclesiastical system
[1:11:09] that's dominating this country that
[1:11:11] there is
[1:11:14] and wonder why
[1:11:16] why don't they come
[1:11:18] they're looking for pleasure they're
[1:11:20] looking for peace
[1:11:21] they're substituting the devil is
[1:11:25] substituting such rowdiest things as
[1:11:27] that to take the place of a real good
[1:11:30] spirit-filled experience where the joy
[1:11:33] of the lord can come upon them and give
[1:11:35] them peace and rest
[1:11:38] they love the pleasures of the world
[1:11:41] more than they love the kingdom of god
[1:11:44] their life proves it
[1:11:46] that's right it's exactly what they live
[1:11:49] shows it
[1:11:50] there's no difference in them seems to
[1:11:52] be who is a believer and who's not
[1:11:54] talked to him that tells us it's dirty
[1:11:56] of jokes and they have their societies
[1:11:59] and so forth and carry on just like the
[1:12:01] rest of the world
[1:12:03] i lived across the street from a great
[1:12:06] parish of a great order of
[1:12:09] christian people as they call themselves
[1:12:12] and every saturday night in the
[1:12:15] floor of the mints why you never heard
[1:12:18] such carrying on and twisting
[1:12:20] rock and rolls and bloodly wiggly and
[1:12:23] all that ungodly stuff
[1:12:27] and carry on
[1:12:29] and then on sunday morning go to the
[1:12:32] church with a past look on their face
[1:12:35] brother when the holy spirit comes into
[1:12:37] your life it changes that life
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:46] and the sad part is creeping into our
[1:12:49] pentecostal organizations
[1:12:52] it's getting into there because just
[1:12:56] as it's always been when israel saw the
[1:12:59] other nations had a king and they wanted
[1:13:02] to act like the other nations
[1:13:04] the old prophet came to him samuel and
[1:13:07] he said you must you're a different
[1:13:09] people
[1:13:11] you mustn't be like them
[1:13:13] god is your king
[1:13:15] he said have i ever told you anything in
[1:13:19] the name of the lord but what come to
[1:13:20] pass
[1:13:22] have i ever begged you for your money or
[1:13:25] taken your finances and so forth to
[1:13:27] build great honorable monuments and
[1:13:30] everything else they had to say that he
[1:13:32] didn't he said then listen to me
[1:13:35] and he had the word of the lord but the
[1:13:38] people had to admit that everything that
[1:13:40] he had said had been the word of the
[1:13:43] lord and it had come to pass just as he
[1:13:46] said it would come to pass but yet the
[1:13:48] people wanted to look like the rest of
[1:13:50] the people
[1:13:52] that's the way it is today that the
[1:13:54] churches are trying to pattern after the
[1:13:57] other churches christ is our pattern
[1:14:00] [Applause]
[1:14:03] so exactly that
[1:14:05] now
[1:14:06] they didn't want it they didn't want the
[1:14:09] message what if that king would have
[1:14:11] humbled himself
[1:14:12] what if he had come down to the you
[1:14:14] you've been humiliated
[1:14:17] and it went back to god and repented i
[1:14:20] believe the man were to live
[1:14:22] i believe elijah would have come to him
[1:14:24] with the word of the lord and the man
[1:14:26] would have lived but he
[1:14:29] hardened his heart
[1:14:30] and would not listen to the lord
[1:14:33] and elijah said go ask him is it because
[1:14:36] there's no no god in israel he has no
[1:14:40] prophet no he had a prophet he had
[1:14:44] there was a god
[1:14:46] but the king didn't want it
[1:14:49] that's what it is today it's just like a
[1:14:52] a patient
[1:14:54] sitting on a doctor's doorstep
[1:14:56] and die sitting on the doorstep because
[1:15:00] he's too stubborn to go in to take the
[1:15:02] medicine the doctor's got for him
[1:15:04] exactly
[1:15:06] die on the step
[1:15:09] of the doctor sitting out there and the
[1:15:10] doctor says i've got the remedy for your
[1:15:13] ailment but it's just too stubborn to go
[1:15:16] in and take it
[1:15:18] that's a dangerous thing amen
[1:15:20] a fellow could die
[1:15:22] and he would die sitting there when
[1:15:24] there's plenty of medicine they got a
[1:15:27] toxin for it but they he won't take it
[1:15:30] he's just too stubborn well then you
[1:15:32] can't let on to the doctor you can't let
[1:15:35] on to the medicine it's the man
[1:15:37] he's the one
[1:15:39] so is it today
[1:15:41] men and women will set in the church
[1:15:44] hallelujah in the church
[1:15:47] and hear the unadulterated gospel in the
[1:15:50] power of the holy ghost and see the
[1:15:53] manifestations and the demonstrations of
[1:15:56] the spirit of a living resurrected
[1:15:59] christ and dying sin setting in the
[1:16:02] church view
[1:16:04] not because there's no bomb
[1:16:06] not because there's no physician but
[1:16:09] it's because the people are too stubborn
[1:16:11] to take the medicine
[1:16:15] trying to find
[1:16:16] the least way of resistance
[1:16:20] going the way of the world
[1:16:22] perishing in the game city of korra you
[1:16:24] know what korra done
[1:16:26] it's always the leaders that gets the
[1:16:27] people mixed up
[1:16:28] and that they perish in the game saying
[1:16:31] of korra
[1:16:32] sure don't blame the doctor
[1:16:36] don't blame the medicine
[1:16:38] it's you to blame if the doctor's got
[1:16:40] the remedy and he's got plenty of it he
[1:16:43] invites you to come and you won't come
[1:16:46] then it's not the doctor's fault neither
[1:16:48] is it the medicine's fault it's your
[1:16:50] fault because you won't take the
[1:16:53] medicine that's right
[1:16:55] and people said in the churches
[1:16:57] dying the few without knowing god
[1:17:00] without receiving the holy ghost because
[1:17:02] they think they'll have to give up some
[1:17:03] of the things of the world they'd rather
[1:17:06] belong to a church that's got a higher
[1:17:08] name or what they think a little more
[1:17:11] prestige
[1:17:12] do you ever realize that god's way is a
[1:17:15] few goes that way and they're despised
[1:17:19] and rejected because they're not of the
[1:17:21] world
[1:17:22] they are of god
[1:17:25] a peculiar people a royal priesthood
[1:17:28] amen offering spiritual sacrifices that
[1:17:32] is the fruits of the lips giving praise
[1:17:34] unto god
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:38] doctors medicines you know they used to
[1:17:40] have a time they didn't have any toxin
[1:17:43] for such as smallpox thousands died
[1:17:46] yearly with smallpox they didn't have a
[1:17:48] diphtheria toxin
[1:17:50] and
[1:17:51] thousands died every year with toxin
[1:17:54] without
[1:17:55] having any toxin they died
[1:17:57] with diphtheria
[1:17:59] but now they got toxin
[1:18:01] they got inoculation for those things
[1:18:04] and
[1:18:05] how does a doctor ever get a hold of
[1:18:08] these medicines anyhow how do they how
[1:18:11] do they ever do it
[1:18:12] you know what they do they put a lot of
[1:18:14] stuff together some poison and then some
[1:18:17] antidote mix it together so they mix up
[1:18:20] a formula
[1:18:22] and then they get a get a guinea pig
[1:18:24] and they inject this medicine into the
[1:18:26] guinea pig if he survives it then they
[1:18:29] give it to you
[1:18:30] and then and if it uh
[1:18:32] says to kill the disease that's in your
[1:18:34] body
[1:18:35] so much of poison so much to upset that
[1:18:38] poison too much poison would kill you
[1:18:40] too much antidote wouldn't do any good
[1:18:42] the medicine wouldn't it's got to be a
[1:18:45] balanced formula
[1:18:48] and
[1:18:48] some medicines from the doctor he can
[1:18:51] give it for instance like penicillin one
[1:18:53] of the great discoveries that they think
[1:18:55] it's a discovery when i was in south
[1:18:58] africa
[1:18:59] i seen a native there and when he would
[1:19:01] they get a sore on their leg or
[1:19:03] something other the sword gets old they
[1:19:05] find an old orange laying another tree
[1:19:07] somewhere that's molded and they rub
[1:19:09] that orange in there
[1:19:11] been doing it for hundreds and hundreds
[1:19:12] of years
[1:19:14] and they get well what is it penicillin
[1:19:17] sure so they think they're smart they're
[1:19:20] hot and cotton africa know that thousand
[1:19:22] years ago
[1:19:24] god done told him not take care of
[1:19:26] himself then we think that it's
[1:19:28] something smart that we got now
[1:19:31] penicillin sometimes an over shot will
[1:19:34] kill a patient
[1:19:35] and some of them it helps it there's a
[1:19:37] question there
[1:19:39] they claim that nowadays course number
[1:19:41] one killer they say is heart trouble
[1:19:45] no odd different from that number one
[1:19:48] killer isn't heart trouble number one
[1:19:50] killer is sin trouble that's the killer
[1:19:53] that's the thing
[1:19:55] it's sin
[1:19:57] that's a killer
[1:20:00] not heart trouble so many people say i
[1:20:03] just got to sin
[1:20:04] i just have to smoke
[1:20:07] women say i just got to cut my hair i i
[1:20:10] can't get any other clothes i just have
[1:20:12] to wear what they got you know what's
[1:20:14] the matter they're making excuses they
[1:20:16] haven't tried god's toxins
[1:20:19] they'll be inoculated from such stuff
[1:20:22] glory
[1:20:24] yes it's because that they haven't tried
[1:20:27] god's toxins they refuse to take it
[1:20:31] for when the spirit of god is in you it
[1:20:34] lines up with the word of god
[1:20:37] if it denies the word of god then it
[1:20:39] isn't you haven't got the right shot yet
[1:20:42] that's all
[1:20:44] you're not inoculated sin still lays at
[1:20:46] the door unbelief in the word
[1:20:49] so it takes the toxin of god
[1:20:53] to kill sin and sin is number one killer
[1:20:57] yes it is it kills and it kills to the
[1:21:00] uttermost so we know that it's a that
[1:21:03] it's a
[1:21:04] sin that does a killing so it's a toxin
[1:21:06] the people just refuse to take it
[1:21:09] they don't like it
[1:21:12] they don't like the thought of new birth
[1:21:15] now we know that any birth is a mess
[1:21:18] i don't care if it's in a pig pen or if
[1:21:20] it's in a pink decorated hospital room
[1:21:23] any birth is a mess
[1:21:25] and the new birth is nothing less it's a
[1:21:28] mess
[1:21:30] it right it'll make you boo-hoo and cry
[1:21:32] and carry on like you and then the
[1:21:34] office masters every end
[1:21:37] but it'll do you good
[1:21:40] amen jesus said except the corner wheat
[1:21:43] falls on the ground and dies it abides
[1:21:44] alone
[1:21:46] and the people don't want to die
[1:21:49] you want to be alive
[1:21:51] in the world
[1:21:53] and still you want to be religious so
[1:21:55] you accept an intellectual conception of
[1:21:58] it
[1:21:59] and then when you do that you're still
[1:22:01] dead in sin and trespasses that's what
[1:22:04] makes people act and do the way they do
[1:22:05] because the spirit that's in them
[1:22:07] dominates your
[1:22:08] life say well other people do this well
[1:22:11] you're not like the other people you are
[1:22:14] dead and your life is hidden god through
[1:22:17] christ and healed by the holy spirit
[1:22:18] hallelujah all right
[1:22:21] see you didn't try the toxin
[1:22:24] it's just because the people don't want
[1:22:26] to try
[1:22:27] now you've got to die you've got to rot
[1:22:30] that's the trouble of people still
[1:22:32] growing out the altar and get some kind
[1:22:33] of sensation jump up and shake hands
[1:22:35] with the preacher go out and get some
[1:22:37] kind of a dogma or creed and recite it
[1:22:40] and say i belong to so-and-so i belong
[1:22:42] to so and so are you a christian i'm so
[1:22:44] and so
[1:22:46] a christian is to be christ-like
[1:22:49] christ like us to believe the word
[1:22:52] if you don't believe the word then he
[1:22:53] can't be christ-like how can you say
[1:22:56] you're a christian and deny half of the
[1:22:57] word
[1:22:59] if the holy spirit wrote the word the
[1:23:00] holy spirit confirms the word and the
[1:23:03] holy spirit is the word
[1:23:06] the word is abiding in you
[1:23:08] brings god's promises to every believer
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] the word means so be it
[1:23:15] i believe it with all my heart it's the
[1:23:17] word of the living god
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:21] notice
[1:23:23] yes
[1:23:24] the new birth they don't want to die now
[1:23:26] they substituted something for a new
[1:23:28] birth
[1:23:29] if the devil if you won't take
[1:23:31] god's word
[1:23:32] then the devil will give you his word
[1:23:34] and that's where the first human race
[1:23:36] where the human race first fell was to
[1:23:39] disbelieve god's word
[1:23:42] the best way that god could ever fortify
[1:23:45] his army was to fortify them with the
[1:23:48] best
[1:23:49] of our nation we got spies in england
[1:23:51] england's got spies here yet we're
[1:23:53] friendly we got spies all over the world
[1:23:55] the world's got spies in here they're
[1:23:57] watching see what kind of a new missile
[1:23:59] what kind of a new thing then they'll go
[1:24:01] back to their nation find something to
[1:24:03] counteract that
[1:24:04] why they're dressed their man get things
[1:24:06] ready for that kind of a war
[1:24:09] it's always going on there's a warfare
[1:24:11] between the devil and god always has
[1:24:13] been
[1:24:14] and every year they're finding something
[1:24:16] new the old airplanes they use back
[1:24:19] there the old p-38s and whatever there
[1:24:21] was they scrapped them they got jets now
[1:24:24] the old spring feels no good at all they
[1:24:26] got a missile rifle now
[1:24:28] the old blockbuster is so far behind
[1:24:30] while even the old trains the old steam
[1:24:32] engine used to pull the stuff up and
[1:24:34] down the tracks obsolete
[1:24:36] sure they got something new they're
[1:24:39] always searching something new something
[1:24:41] new now they're trying to dig down in
[1:24:43] the ground find some way to escape the
[1:24:45] atomic bomb something new something new
[1:24:48] god gave the very best at the beginning
[1:24:51] for his
[1:24:52] great mighty army and he's never had to
[1:24:54] change it
[1:24:55] because as i said last night his first
[1:24:57] decision is the best and only
[1:25:00] he gave his people his word
[1:25:04] and satan
[1:25:06] reasoned with him
[1:25:08] reasons against the word of god that's
[1:25:11] what the devil does today he tries to
[1:25:13] reason it said now this is only reasons
[1:25:15] that you don't have to do this it's only
[1:25:17] reasons we got good doctors who don't
[1:25:19] need divine healing it's only reason we
[1:25:21] got plenty members we don't need uh we
[1:25:24] don't need the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:25:26] they're reasoning now
[1:25:28] god to say the people are mentally upset
[1:25:30] they're emotional because themselves
[1:25:32] they are dead in sin and trespasses and
[1:25:35] knows nothing about the power of god
[1:25:37] amen
[1:25:39] reminds me amen
[1:25:39] an infidel one time was holding the bait
[1:25:41] and and he said there is no such a thing
[1:25:43] as got a little country boy with a
[1:25:46] overhaul jacket on his hair hanging down
[1:25:48] his face walked up began to pee on an
[1:25:50] apple the infidel said sap what are you
[1:25:52] on he said i want to ask you a question
[1:25:55] he said well what is it he cored the
[1:25:57] apple and took a bite and again he said
[1:25:58] is that apple sour or sweet and infidel
[1:26:02] said i don't know because i'm not eating
[1:26:04] he said that's just what i was
[1:26:06] saying said and the people left the
[1:26:09] infidel out of the platform why because
[1:26:12] he had never tasted he had never tried
[1:26:14] he never took the top scene hallelujah
[1:26:18] all the power of god to inoculate you
[1:26:21] from any unbelief of god's word
[1:26:25] a real holy spirit will punctuate every
[1:26:27] sentence within a man
[1:26:29] they won't say the days of miracles is
[1:26:31] passing no such as this and no such as
[1:26:32] that well only reason said we shouldn't
[1:26:35] do it this way we shouldn't do it that
[1:26:36] way what god says the holy spirit said
[1:26:39] amen
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:41] every sentence every word every verse in
[1:26:44] the bible is punctuated with an amen yes
[1:26:47] sir
[1:26:48] the new birth brings a mess but it
[1:26:50] brings new life with it
[1:26:51] that's right a plant anything a seed has
[1:26:54] to rock to bring the new life out of it
[1:26:57] a sinner has to die and rock to his own
[1:27:00] ideas
[1:27:01] his own life has to rot
[1:27:03] that the new life can grow out of it
[1:27:05] it's a mess
[1:27:07] but it's a glorious mess it brings new
[1:27:09] life
[1:27:10] that's what the church sees today but
[1:27:12] they're bypassing with dogmas and so
[1:27:14] forth to try to escape the thoughts of
[1:27:17] dying to themselves they want to live to
[1:27:20] themselves he that lives to himself
[1:27:22] lives for himself and the devil he that
[1:27:25] denies himself shall find his life in
[1:27:28] christ and he'll be a new creature
[1:27:30] now
[1:27:31] we find out
[1:27:33] how they find these toxins
[1:27:35] they take them as i was saying and they
[1:27:38] mix up a farm or the science there and
[1:27:40] give it to a guinea pig now everybody's
[1:27:42] not nature like a guinea pig
[1:27:45] so it'll kill some
[1:27:47] help the others
[1:27:48] we know that
[1:27:50] but you know when
[1:27:51] there was a time
[1:27:53] that god didn't have too good or toxins
[1:27:56] his toxin was by sheep and goats
[1:27:59] but one time
[1:28:00] god was going to perfect his toxin
[1:28:03] so he never
[1:28:05] tried to give it to a guinea pig he gave
[1:28:07] it to himself
[1:28:09] he took the toxin himself that's why the
[1:28:12] christ
[1:28:13] the anointed
[1:28:14] god was made flesh in order to take the
[1:28:18] toxin into his own body
[1:28:21] any good doctor will try the toxin on
[1:28:23] himself and nobody else will do it and
[1:28:25] there was nobody else that could do it
[1:28:27] but god so he came down jehovah and was
[1:28:30] made flesh and dwelt among us and took
[1:28:32] the toxin himself
[1:28:34] [Music]
[1:28:35] [Applause]
[1:28:39] on the jordan
[1:28:40] when he was standing there john full
[1:28:42] record said i'll see the spirit of god
[1:28:44] like a dove the sin of your father
[1:28:47] and he received the toxin and the
[1:28:49] inoculation from sin and death
[1:28:53] he's born of a
[1:28:54] woman and received a toxin
[1:28:57] and they watched him to see what would
[1:28:59] happen
[1:29:00] and they noticed him in his trial they
[1:29:02] noticed him when he come in the face of
[1:29:05] dispute he always helped to the father's
[1:29:07] word
[1:29:10] but uh you know surely uh god wouldn't
[1:29:13] do a thing like that he reasoned it with
[1:29:15] eve but when he come against christ he
[1:29:17] hit against that hundred thousand vote
[1:29:19] why the feathers flew when he come with
[1:29:21] his reasoning because he met him right
[1:29:23] back with just said the lord
[1:29:27] said if you're the son of god and you're
[1:29:29] hungry why don't you turn these stones
[1:29:31] to bread and eat reasoning you could do
[1:29:33] it sure he could but he come back it is
[1:29:35] written man shall not live by bread
[1:29:37] alone but by every word preceded thou
[1:29:39] the mouth of god
[1:29:41] they watched him they seen the toxin
[1:29:43] help in every case when it come time
[1:29:46] faced with death the toxin helped when
[1:29:48] they spit his face made fun of him the
[1:29:51] toxin help
[1:29:54] trust where you got toxin or not that's
[1:29:55] your test
[1:29:57] somebody say something about you and say
[1:29:59] you're old holy roller will you quit
[1:30:00] going to church
[1:30:02] then say you're inoculated
[1:30:04] say you've received the toxin the bomb
[1:30:08] is there no bomb in gilead is there no
[1:30:10] exposition there if there is then why is
[1:30:13] a daughter remember not the mother he
[1:30:15] divorced her but the daughters this
[1:30:17] church that prophecy pertains to this
[1:30:20] why is the daughter of my people her
[1:30:22] health not recovered then here she is
[1:30:24] anemic tonight
[1:30:25] that's right half this way in half that
[1:30:28] way it all scrupled up and all kinds of
[1:30:30] orders and everything else is separated
[1:30:32] and brotherhood scattered everywhere
[1:30:34] half believe in this and half believing
[1:30:35] creed and half living denomination hath
[1:30:37] believing this and that oh my goodness
[1:30:39] her health ought to be standing perfect
[1:30:41] rosie seek with the word of god and the
[1:30:44] power of his
[1:30:46] a matter of the resurrection of my
[1:30:48] people
[1:30:49] where is my daughter a samus signs among
[1:30:53] them like that they just get up and walk
[1:30:54] out
[1:30:55] what's the matter with the daughter of
[1:30:56] my people when it's explained and proven
[1:30:58] by the word
[1:30:59] and the bible said
[1:31:01] if the always to believe the word the
[1:31:03] word is confirmed then you cannot
[1:31:06] disbelieve it but your reasoning letting
[1:31:08] satan tell you in your mind
[1:31:10] last night when you held your hand that
[1:31:12] you was a sinner and didn't want to die
[1:31:13] a sinner and i called you to the
[1:31:15] platform turn him walked out what's the
[1:31:17] matter you let satan reason you're going
[1:31:19] to lose your job i'd rather lose my job
[1:31:21] than lose my life
[1:31:24] your wife will leave you i'd rather lose
[1:31:25] a wife and lose my christ
[1:31:29] your husband your neighbor will make fun
[1:31:31] of you i'd rather than my neighbor and
[1:31:32] make fun of me and be right with god
[1:31:36] but you see you're listening to reasons
[1:31:38] that's it you're just you've had so many
[1:31:41] bogus things don't you realize friend
[1:31:43] that every time a bogus thing declares
[1:31:46] that there's a real one amen
[1:31:48] sure it does notice
[1:31:51] god gave his toxin to himself
[1:31:54] they watched it in a time when they put
[1:31:56] a rag over his face
[1:31:58] he could discern the thoughts in the
[1:32:00] people's heart
[1:32:02] and they put a rag over his face and hit
[1:32:04] him on the head with a stick and said
[1:32:06] now if you are a prophet
[1:32:09] tell us who hit you and we'll believe
[1:32:11] you but the toxin helped
[1:32:15] he wasn't clowning
[1:32:17] that's what samaritan world today they
[1:32:18] want some clowning that's watching out
[1:32:21] this west coast you've got too much
[1:32:22] hollywood in it you've got too much
[1:32:24] claire the holy ghost don't shine the
[1:32:26] holy ghost close
[1:32:28] there's a difference between glowing and
[1:32:30] shining
[1:32:32] the church shines with this big program
[1:32:34] but the holy ghost glows in humility
[1:32:41] humbleness reconciling to the word
[1:32:44] believing the word
[1:32:46] the old saint one time sitting in a
[1:32:48] church a few weeks ago i was supposed to
[1:32:50] be in a chicago meeting and a great
[1:32:53] minister there said we can't have
[1:32:55] brother bran because of his doctrine and
[1:32:57] uh i don't preach a doctrine among them
[1:32:59] but he just wanted to say that he got
[1:33:01] some great big fella from some big
[1:33:03] institute there and he come walking his
[1:33:05] chest with enough papers laid out there
[1:33:07] looked like it he could have done
[1:33:08] anything with it walked up with his
[1:33:10] chest out throw that back this big book
[1:33:12] in an intellectual talk
[1:33:15] it was wonderful his intellectual talk
[1:33:17] but there's no spirit in it
[1:33:19] after a while he seemed that didn't go
[1:33:20] with god's people
[1:33:22] just like
[1:33:23] saul trying to put his ecclesiastical
[1:33:26] vest on david a man of god it didn't fit
[1:33:28] him
[1:33:29] and an intellectual message don't fit a
[1:33:31] spirit-filled church they've got to have
[1:33:34] the power of the holy spirit and the
[1:33:37] manifestation
[1:33:38] jesus said these signs are following
[1:33:41] they got to have it and then the man
[1:33:43] found out they didn't take with the
[1:33:44] pentecostal people he folded up his
[1:33:46] books and come down with his head an old
[1:33:48] saint sitting over the corner come told
[1:33:50] me later said if he would have went up
[1:33:52] the way he come down he'd come down the
[1:33:54] way he went up
[1:33:55] that's about the way it is today what we
[1:33:57] need is back to the holy ghost back to
[1:34:00] the bible back to the power of the
[1:34:02] resurrection of jesus christ not only
[1:34:05] your reasonings and intellectuals and so
[1:34:08] forth certainly they found that it
[1:34:11] helped it held in the hour of death it
[1:34:14] helped in the hour of gethsemane it
[1:34:16] helped in all those things then he died
[1:34:18] he died as i said last night and told
[1:34:21] everything's declared he was dead
[1:34:23] the moon sun and stars the earth the
[1:34:26] earthquakes everything proved he was
[1:34:28] dead the sun went down in the middle of
[1:34:29] the day the roman soldiers said truly
[1:34:31] that was the son of god judah said i
[1:34:32] betrayed innocent blood pilate said give
[1:34:35] me some water let me wash my hands i'll
[1:34:36] have nothing more to do with it he died
[1:34:39] and he went with that inoculation
[1:34:42] but it was a inoculation of eternal life
[1:34:45] on the third day it still helped
[1:34:47] after the prophecies of god was
[1:34:49] fulfilled he rose up on the third day
[1:34:51] alive
[1:34:53] the church saw it and rejoiced now he
[1:34:56] said you got to get inoculated too but i
[1:34:58] want you to go up there and wait until
[1:35:00] you get your inoculation
[1:35:02] yeah
[1:35:03] that's what's the matter with the people
[1:35:04] today they didn't go up wait for their
[1:35:06] inoculation they went to the seminary
[1:35:08] and got their ba instead of going for
[1:35:10] inoculation going up get some of the
[1:35:12] bomb of gilead injected into their veins
[1:35:15] of their soul
[1:35:17] right it went up there on the day of
[1:35:18] pentecost they were all symboled
[1:35:20] together they believed he had raised
[1:35:21] from the dead to talk with him and he
[1:35:23] promised he would send down a whole lot
[1:35:26] of that inoculation and while they were
[1:35:28] all symboled together the bomb began to
[1:35:30] fall upon them and clove and tongues set
[1:35:32] up on them like fire they were all
[1:35:34] filled with the holy ghost and run in
[1:35:36] the outside begin to speak with other
[1:35:38] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:35:39] utterance there was a man who a few days
[1:35:41] before ahead the night jesus stood up on
[1:35:43] a soapboxer's stump and said you men of
[1:35:45] judah and the youth dwell in jerusalem
[1:35:47] let this mean honor you and hearken my
[1:35:49] words these are not drunk as you suppose
[1:35:51] since the third holiday but this is that
[1:35:53] inoculation that was to come that he
[1:35:55] would inoculate from sin from sickness
[1:35:58] from death from the grave unto eternal
[1:36:00] life they've seen it and worked on jesus
[1:36:04] when they were pricked in their hearts
[1:36:05] and they said to them man and brother
[1:36:07] what can we do
[1:36:08] now they had a doctor there his name was
[1:36:11] dr simon peter
[1:36:14] they had a position
[1:36:15] and they had plenty of inoculations
[1:36:17] proven it there's all drunk on it they
[1:36:19] really received in a big way
[1:36:21] and they had dr simon peter there he
[1:36:23] said now just a minute if you want to
[1:36:25] know how to be inoculated i'm going to
[1:36:27] give you a prescription
[1:36:30] and don't you fool with it

[1:37:00] he said now today they've substituted
[1:37:02] things for that prescription
[1:37:04] they try to say shake hands sprinkle a
[1:37:06] little bit or something like that but
[1:37:08] peter said repent every one of you be
[1:37:11] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:37:12] the remission of your sins and you shall
[1:37:15] be unpopulated

[1:38:02] power to
[1:38:04] break an aide
[1:38:06] creature
[1:38:08] hanging over his brother they haven't
[1:38:10] received inoculation that's all there is

[1:38:57] everything else follow exactly what the
[1:39:00] prescription says
[1:39:02] if you take some of the antidote out

[1:39:06] much antidote in the killer in there
[1:39:09] will kill the disease

[1:40:35] prescriptions that's contrary to the
[1:40:38] original prescription go back that's the
[1:40:40] way to get it that's the eternal
